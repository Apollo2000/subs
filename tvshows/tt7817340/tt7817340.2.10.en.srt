1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,433
Previously on "New Amsterdam"...

2
00:00:01,433 --> 00:00:03,593
Effective immediately,
you are stripped of your title

3
00:00:03,627 --> 00:00:06,399
as co-chair of oncology as well
as deputy medical director.

4
00:00:06,424 --> 00:00:08,325
- We're adopting?
- I can explain.

5
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:10,460
You could if you
were coming home tonight.

6
00:00:10,495 --> 00:00:11,995
These women are our patients.

7
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,464
They need our help,
so we are going to Rikers.

8
00:00:14,499 --> 00:00:17,034
Table three is now open.
Don't make me repeat myself.

9
00:00:17,068 --> 00:00:18,569
- Thank you.
- Jackie Conner.

10
00:00:18,603 --> 00:00:20,037
- Get off me!
- Four injured!

11
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:21,805
- We need the medic.
- Get 'em to New Amsterdam.

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,140
You're here from Rikers.

13
00:00:23,174 --> 00:00:24,541
You overdosed and it damaged your heart.

14
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:26,310
This is because I turned state's witness.

15
00:00:26,344 --> 00:00:28,145
Someone's trying to kill me.

16
00:00:32,217 --> 00:00:34,418
Guard?

17
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,298
Came as soon as I heard.

18
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,366
If Brantley thinks
that she can demote you...

19
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,401
She can, Max. And she did.

20
00:00:51,436 --> 00:00:53,070
No, no, no, no, I'm gonna fix this.

21
00:00:53,104 --> 00:00:54,118
All right, I'll call HCC.

22
00:00:54,153 --> 00:00:55,572
I will make an appeal to the board...

23
00:00:55,607 --> 00:00:57,666
The vote was unanimous.

24
00:00:59,244 --> 00:01:00,677
I'm lucky that I wasn't fired.

25
00:01:00,712 --> 00:01:02,512
Fired? Do you think I would
let that happen to you?

26
00:01:02,547 --> 00:01:04,381
If Brantley doesn't
reinstate you immediately,

27
00:01:04,415 --> 00:01:05,626
then she can demote me, too.

28
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:07,517
Oh, Max, I don't need you to fix this.

29
00:01:07,552 --> 00:01:08,852
I don't need you to threaten people.

30
00:01:08,887 --> 00:01:11,096
I just need some time to think.

31
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:13,290
What is there to think about?

32
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:14,424
What...

33
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:16,393
what am I still doing here?

34
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:18,326
Okay, listen to me.
By the end of the week,

35
00:01:18,351 --> 00:01:19,730
you're gonna have everything back, okay?

36
00:01:19,764 --> 00:01:21,531
Your department. Deputy medical director.

37
00:01:21,566 --> 00:01:22,923
In the meantime, there's your patients,

38
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:26,270
your committees.
We still need you here, okay?

39
00:01:26,304 --> 00:01:29,698
I... I need you here.

40
00:01:32,143 --> 00:01:34,119
And what about what I need?

41
00:01:36,814 --> 00:01:39,650
'Cause I don't think I'm gonna
find it at New Amsterdam.

42
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,254
So what are you...

43
00:01:46,157 --> 00:01:47,925
you're gonna leave?

44
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:50,093
I'm...

45
00:01:50,795 --> 00:01:53,055
I'm looking for a reason to stay.

46
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:57,601
And right now, I can't find one.

47

Max.

49
00:02:09,447 --> 00:02:10,580
What they did to Helen is just...

50
00:02:10,615 --> 00:02:12,115
Yeah, I know.

51
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,317
We were a team.

52
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:14,518
If Helen hadn't brought you my way,

53
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:16,353
your cancer wouldn't be in remission.

54
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:18,188
And all that money
she raised for my research,

55
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:19,873
she didn't deserve this.

56
00:02:20,358 --> 00:02:22,459
Frankly, I don't know
how I can fill her shoes.

57
00:02:22,493 --> 00:02:24,761
I can't replace what she brings.

58
00:02:24,796 --> 00:02:27,264
But do you think you could help me reset?

59
00:02:27,298 --> 00:02:29,508
- Rally the troops?
- Of course.

60
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:32,886
There's going to be a lot
of tough decisions to make.

61
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:35,180
I'm glad you have my back.

62
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:39,376
So when you say
that you are moving to Idaho,

63
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,187
do you mean after having the baby?

64
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,357
I actually just gave
my two weeks' notice.

65
00:02:46,651 --> 00:02:47,751
So soon?

66
00:02:47,785 --> 00:02:50,454
Well, the pregnancy's really
doing a number on my OCD.

67
00:02:50,488 --> 00:02:51,888
All my fears are heightened,

68
00:02:51,923 --> 00:02:53,724
my compulsions are more vivid,

69
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:55,792
so I can't really do this without help,

70
00:02:55,827 --> 00:02:57,461
without my parents.

71
00:02:57,495 --> 00:02:58,695
Of course.

72
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,163
It's just that...

73
00:03:00,198 --> 00:03:01,898
Idaho is so very far away.

74
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:03,583
I know.

75
00:03:04,502 --> 00:03:06,670
But I have to do
what's best for the baby.

76
00:03:06,704 --> 00:03:08,405
All surgical residents to OR 6.

77
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:11,375
All surgical residents to OR 6.

78
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:13,810
Zach, Zach, I won't be mad.

79
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:16,179
I just... I feel like I'm going crazy.

80
00:03:16,214 --> 00:03:17,547
Just tell me that you took my pill

81
00:03:17,582 --> 00:03:20,217
to teach me a lesson or to demonstrate...

82
00:03:20,251 --> 00:03:21,651
I didn't take your pill.

83
00:03:21,686 --> 00:03:22,827
And the more you accuse me,

84
00:03:22,861 --> 00:03:24,588
the more you sound like a drug fiend.

85
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:27,190
I'm in agony. Please.

86
00:03:27,225 --> 00:03:28,592
Please, just give me my meds.

87
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:30,444
I can't do that.

88
00:03:30,762 --> 00:03:32,696
But I'm not gonna make it.

89
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,448
You are gonna make it.

90
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:36,500
May be the worst day of your life,

91
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:37,501
but you're gonna make it.

92
00:03:38,603 --> 00:03:39,836
Fine.

93
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:43,248
Fine. Then I am gonna make this
the worst day of your life.

94
00:03:46,277 --> 00:03:47,778
Oh.

95
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:49,129
Yeah.

96
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,715
Hi. Hey.

97
00:03:52,383 --> 00:03:53,717
I'm so glad you came. Thank you.

98
00:03:53,751 --> 00:03:57,554
You texted 52 times, so of course I came.

99
00:03:57,588 --> 00:04:00,891
Yeah, I just wanted to explain myself.

100
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:02,859
And I want to give you
the space to do that,

101
00:04:02,894 --> 00:04:04,294
but I still feel...

102
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,695
You're upset. I know, I know.

103
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,397
I hear you. Believe me.

104
00:04:07,432 --> 00:04:11,034
I've had plenty of time to
think on the new bed over here,

105
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:14,304
and the good news
is that this has all just been

106
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:16,473
one big misunderstanding.

107
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:19,222
Iggy, you tried to adopt another child

108
00:04:19,256 --> 00:04:20,577
without discussing it with me.

109
00:04:20,611 --> 00:04:22,546
That's not a misunderstanding.

110
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,882
Martin, I just... hi.

111
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:29,486
Dr. Frome, sorry to interrupt.

112
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,721
Yeah, now's not really
the best time, Dr. Park.

113
00:04:31,756 --> 00:04:33,390
Sorry, yes. Sorry.

114
00:04:33,424 --> 00:04:36,593
Um, I'm here for my performance review.

115
00:04:37,628 --> 00:04:40,497
Right. Um, yes, you are.

116
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:43,517
This will just take about an hour, tops.

117
00:04:44,602 --> 00:04:47,704
Take all the time you need. Ah, man.

118
00:04:50,341 --> 00:04:52,442
Excuse me. Martin, hey, hey, hey.

119
00:04:52,477 --> 00:04:55,412
Martin, Martin.
Hey, Martin, wait, wait, wait.

120
00:04:55,446 --> 00:04:58,415
It's just that I have to give
Tabitha some bad news.

121
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:01,284
She can't assert herself,
and I don't think she's cut out

122
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,419
to be a therapist,
and I've been putting off

123
00:05:02,453 --> 00:05:03,653
telling her for as long as I can.

124
00:05:03,688 --> 00:05:05,922
I can't put it off anymore.

125
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:08,917
Please.

126
00:05:10,628 --> 00:05:12,379
Good-bye, Ig.

127
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:20,937
So if Evie takes a job in San Francisco,

128
00:05:20,972 --> 00:05:23,874
are you gonna have
a long distance marriage?

129
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:25,442
That's not a thing, right?

130
00:05:25,476 --> 00:05:27,444
Long-distance marriage is an oxymoron.

131
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:29,779
My friend met his fiancée on Asian Charm,

132
00:05:29,814 --> 00:05:31,615
and they still haven't even
met each other in person.

133
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:33,450
Well, with the right data plan,

134
00:05:33,484 --> 00:05:35,719
I predict a lifetime
of happiness for them.

135
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:38,455
I'm just saying distance
doesn't mean no connection.

136
00:05:38,489 --> 00:05:40,323
Some of my deepest conversations

137
00:05:40,358 --> 00:05:42,359
have been over text.

138
00:05:42,393 --> 00:05:43,460
See, that's why my generation

139
00:05:43,494 --> 00:05:45,162
is better than your generation.

140
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:50,667
Good.

141
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:57,874
Guard!

142
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:59,634
I need help here now!

143
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,981
- Is he...
- He's got a pulse.

144
00:06:05,016 --> 00:06:06,650
- Where are your friends?
- I don't know.

145
00:06:06,684 --> 00:06:08,718
They told me... they told me
to go to the bathroom.

146
00:06:08,753 --> 00:06:10,896
Please, I don't know anything else.

147
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,077
His sidearm's missing.

148
00:06:17,895 --> 00:06:20,822
Code silver. I repeat.
We have a code silver.

149
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:24,601
This is a code silver.
Please evacuate the hallways.

150
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:26,937
Central, we're en route.

151
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:30,173
This is a code silver.
Please evacuate the hallways.

152
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,415
This is a code silver.
Please evacuate the hallways.

153
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:42,852
This is a code silver.
Please evacuate the hallways.

154
00:06:42,887 --> 00:06:44,260
Hey, what's going on?
What's a code silver?

155
00:06:44,294 --> 00:06:45,452
It's a combative person with a weapon.

156
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:46,626
- All right, all right.
- Get back in my office.

157
00:06:46,661 --> 00:06:48,592
- Let's go.
- Move to the nearest room.

158
00:06:48,626 --> 00:06:51,027
Hey, wait. In there.

159
00:06:54,098 --> 00:06:57,534
Code silver. Move to the nearest room.

160
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:02,072
That's not gonna work, darling.

161
00:07:02,106 --> 00:07:03,299
No one's coming or going.

162
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,975
Dr. Hiiji said if the pain got worse

163
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:07,644
to press the call button.

164
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:10,372
Push me over.

165
00:07:13,117 --> 00:07:14,918
Where's the pain?

166
00:07:17,955 --> 00:07:20,123
Dr. Hiiji was monitoring your appendix?

167
00:07:20,157 --> 00:07:21,591
Yeah.

168
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:25,562
Well, it's about to rupture.

169
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,133
This is a code silver.

170
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:31,685
Max.

171
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,904
It's okay. They're with me.

172
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:39,609
Dr. Goodwin, you ready?

173
00:07:44,482 --> 00:07:46,149
This is a code silver.

174
00:07:46,183 --> 00:07:48,151
Yeah.

175
00:07:50,688 --> 00:07:52,689
Lock this door,
and do not let anyone in or out

176
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:54,758
under any circumstances
until I get back, okay?

177
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:57,085
Please evacuate the hallways.

178
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:13,943
Copy that.

179
00:08:16,981 --> 00:08:21,117
This is a code silver.
Please evacuate the hallways.

180
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,654
Ella.

181
00:08:25,523 --> 00:08:26,623
Ella?

182
00:08:26,657 --> 00:08:28,825
This is a code silver.

183
00:08:30,452 --> 00:08:33,530
Move to the nearest room. Code silver.

184
00:08:33,564 --> 00:08:37,033
Move to the nearest room
and wait for authorities.

185
00:08:39,704 --> 00:08:41,504
This is a code silver.

186
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,642
Okay, listen up.
We still have a job to do.

187
00:08:45,676 --> 00:08:48,436
Everybody needs to maintain
their focus on the patient

188
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,213
and the operation at hand.

189
00:08:50,247 --> 00:08:51,581
We may be on lockdown,

190
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:52,686
but it's nothing we can't handle.

191
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,983
High levels of catecholamine.

192
00:08:54,018 --> 00:08:56,753
Cardiotoxicity indicated.

193
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:58,755
Likely a combination of...

194
00:09:10,225 --> 00:09:12,059
We have three Rikers
inmates on the loose.

195
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,927
Overtook a guard in the ED,
and Corolla stole his gun.

196
00:09:13,961 --> 00:09:15,095
The guard, how is he?

197
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:16,163
- Stable.
- Good.

198
00:09:16,197 --> 00:09:17,631
We interrogated the fourth inmate.

199
00:09:17,665 --> 00:09:19,466
She said that killing the guard
wasn't their motive.

200
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,435
Well, then what do they want?

201
00:09:21,469 --> 00:09:23,737
She didn't know or wouldn't say.

202
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,439
Our culprits are Dominique Ann Reed,

203
00:09:25,473 --> 00:09:27,441
Suzan Parker, Jackie Conner.

204
00:09:27,475 --> 00:09:29,443
- Jackie Conner?
- You know her?

205
00:09:29,477 --> 00:09:31,734
No, I... we had a team at Rikers today,

206
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:33,346
and she helped us.
Are you sure that she...

207
00:09:33,381 --> 00:09:36,116
Positive. We've got officers
on every exit and stairwell.

208
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,119
Shut down all the elevators.
Now we need to do a sweep.

209
00:09:39,153 --> 00:09:40,699
I'll come with you. I need to triage

210
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:42,622
who's stable enough to stay
and who needs to be evacuated.

211
00:09:42,657 --> 00:09:44,458
Max, where are we releasing people?

212
00:09:44,492 --> 00:09:47,594
I need to get my patient to Baptist.
She needs constant care.

213
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,296
How about establish
a single egress point?

214
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,664
So we can clear everyone properly,

215
00:09:50,698 --> 00:09:52,466
but keep the prisoners contained.

216
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,369
Uh, basement.

217
00:09:54,836 --> 00:09:56,287
Basement.

218
00:10:06,547 --> 00:10:09,449
Ella, come with me.

219
00:10:16,557 --> 00:10:18,900
It's okay. We are safe in here.

220
00:10:18,935 --> 00:10:21,628
I don't... I don't feel safe.

221
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,164
No. Sorry.

222
00:10:24,198 --> 00:10:27,467
Is there anything
I can do that might help?

223
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,236
I, um...

224
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,339
I like to organize things
from largest to smallest.

225
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:33,394
Okay.

226
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:34,641
I know that sounds stupid, but...

227
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,677
No, no, it's not stupid. It's not stupid.

228
00:10:39,614 --> 00:10:40,780
Oh.

229
00:10:44,418 --> 00:10:45,418
Threes are better.

230
00:10:45,453 --> 00:10:47,255
Three?

231
00:10:47,788 --> 00:10:49,723
This is a code silver.

232
00:10:49,757 --> 00:10:51,558
Oh, I hate this so much.

233
00:10:51,592 --> 00:10:53,193
These kids have enough trauma
in their lives

234
00:10:53,227 --> 00:10:55,529
- without alarms blaring and...
- They're safe.

235
00:10:55,563 --> 00:10:58,231
There's nothing more you can do for them.

236
00:10:58,266 --> 00:10:59,533
And you said you wanted to talk to me,

237
00:10:59,567 --> 00:11:02,235
so talk.

238
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,538
Martin, forgive me I can't
focus on us right now.

239
00:11:04,572 --> 00:11:05,777
No, now seems like

240
00:11:05,812 --> 00:11:07,374
the perfect time to focus on us,

241
00:11:07,408 --> 00:11:09,543
considering we're gonna be
locked in a room together,

242
00:11:09,577 --> 00:11:12,712
alone for the first time
in God knows how long.

243
00:11:19,253 --> 00:11:20,687
This is a code silver.

244
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,390
Please evacuate the hallways.

245
00:11:26,327 --> 00:11:28,595
Okay, right this way.
Let's line up over here,

246
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:30,130
and make sure that you show your ID bands

247
00:11:30,164 --> 00:11:32,399
on the way out, okay?

248
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:33,577
How did this happen?

249
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:35,735
Jackie from Rikers.

250
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,537
- What?
- Dr. Goodwin.

251
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,140
- We need you over here.
- Yeah, okay.

252
00:11:40,174 --> 00:11:41,741
I know this isn't your responsibility,

253
00:11:41,776 --> 00:11:43,143
and I can understand
why you'd want to just

254
00:11:43,177 --> 00:11:44,467
check out of here right about now,

255
00:11:44,501 --> 00:11:46,479
but I can really, really use your help.

256
00:11:46,514 --> 00:11:48,815
No, of course, go.
I'll keep things moving down here.

257
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,555
I'm so sorry, Lenore.

258
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,290
Security won't let me leave my office,

259
00:11:57,325 --> 00:11:59,259
but Dr. Bloom will take good care of you.

260
00:11:59,293 --> 00:12:02,162
Okay, I'm gonna need clamps, retractors.

261
00:12:02,196 --> 00:12:03,957
Supply cabinet.

262
00:12:04,632 --> 00:12:06,600
Are you out of your mind?
Are you even a surgeon?

263
00:12:06,634 --> 00:12:07,901
I did my rotations.

264
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:11,137
Okay, I need that tray.

265
00:12:11,172 --> 00:12:12,405
If you put any weight
on that leg of yours,

266
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
the bone will snap.

267
00:12:13,474 --> 00:12:14,587
I am not the patient right now.

268
00:12:14,621 --> 00:12:15,933
- Yes, you are.
- Gloves?

269
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:18,680
You're my patient.
You're my responsibility.

270
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,353
You might as well take a second pill.

271
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,320
You're sure as hell gonna need it.

272
00:12:32,526 --> 00:12:35,495
I can't operate on narcotics.

273
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:36,830
Besides...

274
00:12:36,864 --> 00:12:38,765
she's gonna need this more than me.

275
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,700
Come on.

276
00:12:40,735 --> 00:12:44,271
Okay. Lenore, here.

277
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,999
Now swallow.

278
00:12:48,743 --> 00:12:51,087
Now give her a few more.

279
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,654
Security asked me to clear
the oncology department.

280
00:13:00,688 --> 00:13:02,724
I'll come with you.

281
00:13:06,527 --> 00:13:08,495
Helen.

282
00:13:40,728 --> 00:13:41,861
Are you okay? What happened?

283
00:13:41,896 --> 00:13:44,264
I got separated from my group, so I hid.

284
00:13:44,298 --> 00:13:46,032
Okay, we've got you.

285
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:49,235
There you go. Easy, easy.

286
00:13:51,272 --> 00:13:53,775
We're gonna get you out of here.

287
00:14:04,652 --> 00:14:07,053
I need a wider field of vision, please.

288
00:14:07,088 --> 00:14:08,873
On it.

289
00:14:29,155 --> 00:14:30,321
How are you feeling?

290
00:14:30,355 --> 00:14:31,689
Just want to get out of here.

291
00:14:31,723 --> 00:14:33,190
How did you get injured?

292
00:14:33,225 --> 00:14:35,526
It was all so scary.

293
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,128
Wait, wait, wait, whoa, just lay down.

294
00:14:37,162 --> 00:14:38,229
Just say down.

295
00:14:38,263 --> 00:14:40,164
Just lay down, okay?

296
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,101
She's clammy, and her pulse is rapid.

297
00:14:44,136 --> 00:14:47,168
I need to examine your injuries.

298
00:14:47,202 --> 00:14:49,006
- Do you mind?
- Mm-mm.

299
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,778
Mm, sutures are broken.

300
00:14:53,812 --> 00:14:55,613
She could go into hypovolemic shock.

301
00:14:55,647 --> 00:14:57,948
I can keep pressure on it.

302
00:15:00,018 --> 00:15:01,919
Okay. Uh...

303
00:15:01,953 --> 00:15:03,287
there's no signal.

304
00:15:03,322 --> 00:15:04,588
I'm gonna grab gauze and tape.

305
00:15:04,623 --> 00:15:06,223
Okay.

306
00:15:07,659 --> 00:15:09,559
I just want to go home.

307
00:15:14,533 --> 00:15:16,774
What happened to your ID band?

308
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:19,872
Thought I was leaving.
Didn't need it anymore.

309
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,215
You know I never would've gone
through with it, right, Martin?

310
00:15:41,827 --> 00:15:43,828
Actually adopt
a child without telling you?

311
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,964
I was gathering information
so that we could discuss it.

312
00:15:46,998 --> 00:15:48,833
But we never did discuss it.

313
00:15:48,867 --> 00:15:50,601
What, were you just hoping
I wouldn't notice

314
00:15:50,635 --> 00:15:52,768
an extra kid at the breakfast table?

315
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,873
I think you're overreacting.

316
00:15:55,907 --> 00:15:56,874
Am I?

317
00:15:56,908 --> 00:15:57,908
Yes.

318
00:15:58,274 --> 00:16:01,779
All of our responsibilities,
our social life,

319
00:16:01,813 --> 00:16:05,316
everything we do is on your terms.

320
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,651
You obviously don't care what I think.

321
00:16:07,686 --> 00:16:09,220
That is not true.

322
00:16:09,254 --> 00:16:10,488
Never mind. You don't get it.

323
00:16:10,522 --> 00:16:11,989
What, Martin? What...

324
00:16:12,023 --> 00:16:13,581
What don't I get?

325
00:16:17,729 --> 00:16:18,829
Dr. Frome?

326
00:16:18,864 --> 00:16:20,297
Yes?

327
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:21,365
Um...

328
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,300
sorry, nothing. Never mind.

329
00:16:23,335 --> 00:16:24,702
No, no, no. What?

330
00:16:24,736 --> 00:16:25,870
What is it?

331
00:16:25,904 --> 00:16:31,142
Okay, I think maybe
Martin is saying that sometimes

332
00:16:31,176 --> 00:16:35,186
maybe you make him feel
like he's not enough for you.

333
00:16:36,948 --> 00:16:39,316
Which is none of my business.
I'm so sorry.

334
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:40,569
Shouldn't have said anything.

335
00:16:40,604 --> 00:16:42,720
No, that's fine, Tabitha.

336
00:16:42,754 --> 00:16:43,936
You're entitled to your opinion.

337
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,190
I just happen to think that you are way,

338
00:16:46,224 --> 00:16:47,990
way off base.

339
00:16:52,097 --> 00:16:53,704
She's right.

340
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,707
She's out.

341
00:17:06,144 --> 00:17:08,302
If you're really gonna do this...

342
00:17:09,214 --> 00:17:11,415
now's the time.

343
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,956
I think I need to be standing.

344
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,232
What, like an actual surgeon?

345
00:17:22,093 --> 00:17:23,985
What if you were to hold me up?

346
00:17:24,796 --> 00:17:27,029
It's the only thing that might work.

347
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,067
All right. Here we go.

348
00:17:30,101 --> 00:17:31,268
Okay.

349
00:17:31,303 --> 00:17:32,770
Three, two, one.

350
00:17:35,907 --> 00:17:37,775
All right. I got you.

351
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:39,243
I got you.

352
00:17:39,277 --> 00:17:40,811
Okay.

353
00:17:40,846 --> 00:17:43,948
Well, this isn't awkward at all.

354
00:17:43,982 --> 00:17:45,382
If you drop me...

355
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:46,884
You'll probably be in that wheelchair

356
00:17:46,918 --> 00:17:48,886
for the rest of your life.

357
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,297
Okay, I got what we need.

358
00:18:00,332 --> 00:18:01,320
- Max...
- Yeah?

359
00:18:01,355 --> 00:18:02,405
We need to talk.

360
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,168
- What?
- We need to talk.

361
00:18:06,705 --> 00:18:08,738
None of this was my idea.

362
00:18:09,274 --> 00:18:10,741
I didn't touch that guard.

363
00:18:10,775 --> 00:18:13,300
I've never hurt anyone in my life.
Please.

364
00:18:14,846 --> 00:18:16,480
I don't want my daughters
thinking I'm some...

365
00:18:16,515 --> 00:18:19,950
Okay, um, listen. We're gonna help you.

366
00:18:19,985 --> 00:18:22,920
But you have to tell us
where the other inmates are.

367
00:18:22,954 --> 00:18:25,756
If you fix me up,
they're gonna send me back to Rikers.

368
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,043
If we don't stop the bleeding,

369
00:18:27,077 --> 00:18:28,577
you won't be going anywhere.

370
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,098
It all started when
Fran didn't die from the OD.

371
00:18:34,132 --> 00:18:36,033
They had to figure out another way.

372
00:18:36,067 --> 00:18:38,168
So Jackie made us
all fight to get us over here.

373
00:18:38,203 --> 00:18:39,436
Who's Fran?

374
00:18:39,471 --> 00:18:40,571
I don't even know.

375
00:18:40,605 --> 00:18:44,231
Some state's witness who
wanted to snitch on someone.

376
00:18:45,076 --> 00:18:46,110
That's Reynolds's patient.

377
00:18:46,144 --> 00:18:47,344
Max, we have to warn him.

378
00:18:47,379 --> 00:18:48,712
- Are you...
- Yeah, no, go.

379
00:18:48,747 --> 00:18:50,214
Hurry.

380
00:18:52,551 --> 00:18:56,186
Dominique, this is gonna hurt.

381
00:18:58,156 --> 00:18:59,790
So when I am scared,

382
00:18:59,824 --> 00:19:02,293
I say the alphabet backwards, you know?

383
00:19:02,327 --> 00:19:05,729
Zed, Y, X, W...

384
00:19:07,065 --> 00:19:08,866
Hello. Hello, is anyone in there?

385
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,383
Don't.

386
00:19:11,002 --> 00:19:13,537
Can you let me in?

387
00:19:13,572 --> 00:19:15,372
Protocol is not to open any doors

388
00:19:15,407 --> 00:19:17,875
until the danger has been cleared.

389
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:20,344
Please, let me in!
There's nowhere else to go!

390
00:19:20,378 --> 00:19:21,399
Vijay.

391
00:19:21,434 --> 00:19:23,213
Don't open it.

392
00:19:23,248 --> 00:19:25,022
Let me in!

393
00:19:33,024 --> 00:19:34,782
Did you warn Reynolds?

394
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,194
No.

395
00:19:39,531 --> 00:19:41,330
Can you walk?

396
00:19:42,367 --> 00:19:44,234
I don't know. Why?

397
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:46,335
Dr. Goodwin's got a plan.

398
00:19:47,606 --> 00:19:50,107
Getting you both out of here.

399
00:19:53,278 --> 00:19:55,112
Note the WBP request.

400
00:19:57,949 --> 00:19:59,353
Heart rate's a little fast.

401
00:19:59,387 --> 00:20:01,552
Hang another bag of normal saline.

402
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:03,954
Grab a liter bag of normal
saline from the cabinet.

403
00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:06,924
Re-warming agents in the line.

404
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:10,260
Oxygenator pressure normal.

405
00:20:10,295 --> 00:20:13,030
One dose.

406
00:20:13,064 --> 00:20:14,363
Excuse me.

407
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:17,434
What's your name?

408
00:20:25,076 --> 00:20:26,110
Oh!

409
00:20:26,144 --> 00:20:27,177
Someone stop her.

410
00:20:27,212 --> 00:20:29,413
No, Duke, Duke, Duke!
Get back to the patient.

411
00:20:29,447 --> 00:20:30,524
- Call security.
- All right, you heard him.

412
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:32,049
We've got several lacerations.

413
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,217
Get the fluids going wide open.

414
00:20:33,251 --> 00:20:34,451
Multiple stab wounds.

415
00:20:34,486 --> 00:20:36,954
Adipose tissue and obliques involved.

416
00:20:36,988 --> 00:20:38,288
- Boss?
- No arterial spurt.

417
00:20:38,323 --> 00:20:40,457
- You're bleeding.
- Capillary leak only.

418
00:20:40,492 --> 00:20:43,527
Need a fresh suture kit. Let's go.

419
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,765
You really think that you
can sneak them out of here?

420
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,800
It's the safest way.

421
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,034
Safest for who?

422
00:20:53,069 --> 00:20:54,803
- How much farther?
- Jackie.

423
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,771
Don't act like you know me.

424
00:20:56,806 --> 00:20:58,807
Dominique needs help.
If you just let me take her...

425
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,576
I don't care about her
or about you, okay?

426
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,330
So after all the help
that you gave us in Rikers,

427
00:21:03,364 --> 00:21:05,580
after everything, you were just using us?

428
00:21:05,614 --> 00:21:07,263
Yeah, that's show you survive.

429
00:21:07,297 --> 00:21:08,983
Her gang uses me, I use you,

430
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,388
everyone has a price,

431
00:21:10,422 --> 00:21:12,053
and everything is for sale, right?

432
00:21:12,088 --> 00:21:14,554
We don't get the luxury of caring.

433
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,426
Give her your phone.

434
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:19,961
Come on, give her your phones right now.

435
00:21:19,995 --> 00:21:21,896
Hand them over.

436
00:21:22,223 --> 00:21:23,665
What do they say?

437
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:24,733
Uh, both the same.

438
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:27,102
"Attack in OR 7. Patient critical.

439
00:21:27,136 --> 00:21:29,980
Request 6 units of AB plus ASAP."

440
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:31,840
That means Suzan didn't get it done.

441
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,942
Fran's still alive.

442
00:21:33,976 --> 00:21:35,443
We have to go back in.

443
00:21:35,478 --> 00:21:36,951
Jackie, I can't do this.

444
00:21:36,985 --> 00:21:38,580
Look, we don't have a choice.
Where's OR 7?

445
00:21:38,614 --> 00:21:39,759
Jackie, think about this, all right?

446
00:21:39,793 --> 00:21:41,116
The hospital is on lockdown.

447
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,684
That means there will be cops,
guards everywhere.

448
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:43,991
They will recognize you.

449
00:21:43,992 --> 00:21:45,791
Now, I am willing to get you out of here,

450
00:21:45,816 --> 00:21:47,455
but there is no way
that I am taking you back

451
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,858
- to my hospital...
- Take me to OR 7.

452
00:21:50,404 --> 00:21:51,926
Right now.

453
00:21:53,662 --> 00:21:55,463
I can take you there.

454
00:21:55,498 --> 00:21:58,933
I know a way to get you past
the cops and into the OR, but...

455
00:21:58,968 --> 00:22:02,437
But first, I'm gonna need you
to put the gun down.

456
00:22:06,976 --> 00:22:08,777
Okay. Start walking.

457
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,103
Come on.

458
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:17,786
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

459
00:22:19,555 --> 00:22:22,700
Love, when I look at us,
I don't think that you're...

460
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:26,661
not enough or anything like that.

461
00:22:26,695 --> 00:22:29,063
I don't know how to explain it.

462
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:32,667
Can you think of an instance
where you felt like that?

463
00:22:34,837 --> 00:22:36,171
Barney.

464
00:22:36,205 --> 00:22:38,139
The dinosaur?

465
00:22:38,174 --> 00:22:40,975
No, it was a goat that we rescued.

466
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:44,179
And guess where Barney the goat lived.

467
00:22:44,213 --> 00:22:47,549
He lived in the house
for... for a minute.

468
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,518
And the weird thing is that...

469
00:22:50,531 --> 00:22:52,104
it was kinda great.

470
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:57,892
He was strangely well mannered,
a great companion for the kids.

471
00:22:57,927 --> 00:23:01,563
Iggy adorably dressed him up
as a dog for Halloween.

472
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:02,897
Mm.

473
00:23:02,932 --> 00:23:04,066
Made all his meals,

474
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,834
even found him this cute little goat bed.

475
00:23:05,868 --> 00:23:07,069
In the spirit of full disclosure,

476
00:23:07,103 --> 00:23:08,537
it wasn't really a goat bed

477
00:23:08,571 --> 00:23:11,206
because they don't actually make those.

478
00:23:12,241 --> 00:23:15,844
Yeah, but as I watched Iggy
take care of this animal,

479
00:23:15,878 --> 00:23:17,588
I realized...

480
00:23:18,581 --> 00:23:20,849
I'm jealous.

481
00:23:20,883 --> 00:23:22,617
Of a goat.

482
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,219
And I'm not even a jealous guy.

483
00:23:24,253 --> 00:23:26,788
It's just, he looked so happy.

484
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,056
He always does.

485
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,124
When he's helping, volunteering,

486
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,960
and that is so beautiful.

487
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,695
But I wonder,

488
00:23:33,729 --> 00:23:36,731
do I ever make my husband look like that?

489
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,379
Am I even capable?

490
00:23:39,413 --> 00:23:40,861
Martin.

491
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,905
Of course you are.

492
00:23:43,939 --> 00:23:45,449
I...

493
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:49,711
helping people is just
fundamentally part of who I am.

494
00:23:49,745 --> 00:23:51,813
And, um, Dr. Frome,

495
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,792
how do you think that you help Martin?

496
00:23:56,619 --> 00:23:58,128
I, um...

497
00:23:59,755 --> 00:24:01,256
I love him.

498
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:04,301
With all my heart.

499
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,345
Well, that's...

500
00:24:06,996 --> 00:24:09,063
what I asked...

501
00:24:09,098 --> 00:24:11,299
did you help Martin tell the kids

502
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:13,977
that they couldn't keep
the goat as a pet?

503
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,005
Martin's at home with the kids, so...

504
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,339
And Martin had to tell a lawyer

505
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,975
that he can't take in a needy child.

506
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:24,679
Do you think
that was maybe painful for him?

507
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:25,980
Yeah.

508
00:24:26,015 --> 00:24:29,918
How often do your efforts to mend hearts

509
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:33,497
wind up with Martin having to break them?

510
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,658
Martin has asked you
to change your behavior,

511
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:39,920
and you love him, right?

512
00:24:41,697 --> 00:24:44,799
So, I mean, maybe it's not
that you won't stop,

513
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:47,261
and more that you can't.

514
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,144
Why can't you stop, Dr. Frome?

515
00:25:02,318 --> 00:25:03,885
Stop moving.

516
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,853
Trying to retract the far edge

517
00:25:05,888 --> 00:25:08,790
to make sure the omentum is clear of pus.

518
00:25:08,824 --> 00:25:10,191
In English.

519
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:11,508
I can't bend forward.

520
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:13,661
I need you to move to the other side.

521
00:25:13,696 --> 00:25:15,630
- But your leg...
- Forget about my leg.

522
00:25:15,664 --> 00:25:17,065
I won't die, but if you don't do this,

523
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,959
then Lenore will.

524
00:25:20,235 --> 00:25:21,903
You ask me to monitor your medication,

525
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,371
and then you accuse me of stealing it.

526
00:25:23,405 --> 00:25:24,839
You ask me to hold you up,

527
00:25:24,873 --> 00:25:26,808
and then a minute later to drop you.

528
00:25:26,842 --> 00:25:28,309
Do you even care about getting better?

529
00:25:28,344 --> 00:25:31,346
Yes, I want to get better so I can help.

530
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,557
Otherwise, what's the point?

531
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:36,101
Who am I getting better for?

532
00:25:40,055 --> 00:25:41,856
All right.

533
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,113
I'm gonna set you down.

534
00:25:45,147 --> 00:25:46,728
Okay.

535
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,631
I think I got it.

536
00:26:06,115 --> 00:26:07,841
I got it.

537
00:26:09,678 --> 00:26:11,637
Now we just need to close her up.

538
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:17,792
- That's her!
- She has a weapon!

539
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:18,860
Freeze!

540
00:26:18,894 --> 00:26:19,961
Drop the weapon!

541
00:26:21,463 --> 00:26:23,931
Shot fired, shots fired. Inmate down.

542
00:26:23,966 --> 00:26:26,034
Ella, we are safe. The door is locked.

543
00:26:26,068 --> 00:26:27,035
No, I...

544
00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:29,937
I usually... I usually
feel movement, but I don't.

545
00:26:29,972 --> 00:26:31,806
I put too much stress on the baby.

546
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,041
What if...

547
00:26:33,075 --> 00:26:34,826
what if I...

548
00:26:36,078 --> 00:26:38,079
I can't feel the baby, Vijay.

549
00:26:39,448 --> 00:26:40,782
All clear.

550
00:26:44,787 --> 00:26:48,156
O2 sat's 98. Pressure 130/88.

551
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,092
Dopamine at 7.

552
00:26:51,126 --> 00:26:52,160
Flushes are ready.

553
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:55,333
Dr. Reynolds, can I help you?

554
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:59,167
Boss, you okay? You want me to take over?

555
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,836
Can I get a sponge count?

556
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,438
We're not hitting
our hemodynamic targets.

557
00:27:03,472 --> 00:27:05,406
L-sac's steady.

558
00:27:05,441 --> 00:27:06,841
More irrigation, please.

559
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,027
BP's dropping.

560
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,572
There's a pumper in here somewhere.

561
00:27:12,114 --> 00:27:14,415
Now we're at 6.

562
00:27:16,285 --> 00:27:18,537
Are you okay?

563
00:27:29,298 --> 00:27:31,550
Retract the lung.

564
00:27:33,202 --> 00:27:35,387
There. There it is.

565
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,472
Femoral map is the most accurate.

566
00:27:42,144 --> 00:27:44,378
Pushing 4 milligrams of fentanyl.

567
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:45,880
BP's stabilizing.

568
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,482
Eluting stent is in place.

569
00:27:47,516 --> 00:27:49,884
Sternal wires and plates are ready.

570
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,112
Sternum set on the tray.

571
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,889
Helen, please don't do this.

572
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,584
- Do you trust me?
- It's not about trust.

573
00:27:56,619 --> 00:27:57,943
It is all about trust.

574
00:27:57,977 --> 00:28:00,828
If we don't have that,
then I truly don't belong here.

575
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:11,172
- Who's there?
- Helen Sharpe, oncology.

576
00:28:11,206 --> 00:28:13,541
We were helping escort
patients to the evac route,

577
00:28:13,575 --> 00:28:15,042
but she's too critical to make it.

578
00:28:15,077 --> 00:28:17,845
We need to get her to the OR at once.

579
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:24,787
This is Dr. Goodwin,

580
00:28:24,822 --> 00:28:27,188
the hospital's medical director.

581
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,266
It's all right.
You need to let us through.

582
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:44,647
Go ahead.

583
00:28:58,135 --> 00:28:59,822
How do you feel when you help someone?

584
00:28:59,856 --> 00:29:01,348
Um...

585
00:29:02,372 --> 00:29:04,239
like I'm here for a reason.

586
00:29:04,273 --> 00:29:06,728
So how do you feel when you don't?

587
00:29:08,811 --> 00:29:10,512
Everyone in the department
heard about the time

588
00:29:10,546 --> 00:29:13,527
that you gave your shoes
to a homeless man.

589
00:29:14,617 --> 00:29:17,322
Well, Imagine that
you just walked by him.

590
00:29:17,854 --> 00:29:19,658
How would you have felt?

591
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,702
Like a bad person.

592
00:29:23,526 --> 00:29:26,028
And I would've been. He needed shoes.

593
00:29:26,062 --> 00:29:27,582
That's what you do.

594
00:29:28,498 --> 00:29:30,966
Well, a lot of people walked by him.

595
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,601
Are they all bad people?

596
00:29:32,635 --> 00:29:34,870
No. Not at all.

597
00:29:35,311 --> 00:29:37,312
So why are you?

598
00:29:39,409 --> 00:29:43,278
Can you try and list three
good things about yourself

599
00:29:43,312 --> 00:29:44,946
that have nothing to do with helping?

600
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:46,882
Three things that would
be great about yourself

601
00:29:46,916 --> 00:29:49,351
if you never adopt another kid,

602
00:29:49,385 --> 00:29:52,107
or rescue another goat.

603
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,549
Okay, how about one thing?

604
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,086
Dr. Frome...

605
00:30:13,753 --> 00:30:17,479
what do you think would happen
if you stopped helping people?

606
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,595
They'd see...

607
00:30:25,254 --> 00:30:27,189
Iggy...

608
00:30:27,223 --> 00:30:28,590
what would they see?

609
00:30:35,098 --> 00:30:37,068
They would see...

610
00:30:38,034 --> 00:30:40,947
what a complete loser I am.

611
00:30:41,471 --> 00:30:43,158
Just...

612
00:30:44,273 --> 00:30:50,011
corny, nerdy, fat, worthless, nothing.

613
00:30:50,046 --> 00:30:51,625
- Baby...
- No, I... Martin,

614
00:30:51,654 --> 00:30:55,417
I know it's not healthy, and I...

615
00:30:57,153 --> 00:30:59,454
I have this voice in my head,

616
00:30:59,489 --> 00:31:02,010
and it's a really loud one.

617
00:31:05,394 --> 00:31:07,224
And it's saying...

618
00:31:08,397 --> 00:31:11,144
that one of these days,
you're gonna realize...

619
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:16,471
That you can do so much better than me.

620
00:31:22,578 --> 00:31:24,824
My ability to help people...

621
00:31:26,415 --> 00:31:28,912
that's all I have. That's the...

622
00:31:29,418 --> 00:31:31,706
that's the only thing
I even like about myself.

623
00:31:38,261 --> 00:31:40,562
Without that,
I just can't think of a reason

624
00:31:40,596 --> 00:31:43,231
why you would keep me around.

625
00:31:43,266 --> 00:31:44,803
I can't.

626
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:49,938
Dr. Frome, I'm gonna ask
Martin to do something now,

627
00:31:49,972 --> 00:31:52,307
and it would great if you
could just sit and listen.

628
00:31:52,341 --> 00:31:53,341
Is that okay?

629
00:31:53,376 --> 00:31:55,230
Yeah, okay.

630
00:31:55,978 --> 00:31:59,281
Martin, will you tell your husband

631
00:31:59,315 --> 00:32:02,654
three things that you think
are good about him?

632
00:32:07,156 --> 00:32:08,743
You're kind.

633
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:12,289
You are a wonderful father.

634
00:32:13,396 --> 00:32:15,096
And you are beautiful.

635
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:19,965
You're hilarious. You're patient.

636
00:32:19,999 --> 00:32:21,102
You're smart.

637
00:32:21,137 --> 00:32:23,672
You make friends everywhere you go

638
00:32:23,706 --> 00:32:25,802
'cause they see what I see.

639
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,180
You shine.

640
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,480
You're amazing.

641
00:32:33,977 --> 00:32:35,937
You're the love of my life.

642
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:38,453
And my life is so much better

643
00:32:38,487 --> 00:32:40,188
than I ever thought it was gonna be

644
00:32:40,223 --> 00:32:44,259
because of you, Iggy.

645
00:32:47,163 --> 00:32:48,700
I love you.

646
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,121
I love you.

647
00:32:55,171 --> 00:32:56,705
If I could've stayed calm,

648
00:32:56,739 --> 00:32:58,306
this wouldn't have happened.

649
00:32:58,341 --> 00:33:00,709
If I were normal,
I could've been a mother.

650
00:33:00,743 --> 00:33:03,144
You will still be a mother.

651
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:05,240
A good mother, a wonderful mother.

652
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,359
How?

653
00:33:06,394 --> 00:33:07,816
Because your baby is okay.

654
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:10,051
You don't know that.

655
00:33:10,086 --> 00:33:11,486
Okay.

656
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,756
I will listen to your baby's heartbeats,

657
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:17,425
and that will tell you.

658
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,227
Okay. Do you hear anything?

659
00:33:19,262 --> 00:33:22,430
You need to slow down your breathing.

660
00:33:22,465 --> 00:33:25,612
I can't, I can't.

661
00:33:26,535 --> 00:33:28,670
You said your OCD makes you imagine

662
00:33:28,704 --> 00:33:31,840
the worst possible circumstances.

663
00:33:31,874 --> 00:33:34,409
What if you imagine the best?

664
00:33:34,443 --> 00:33:38,166
Hm? Close your eyes and try.

665
00:33:39,282 --> 00:33:40,919
Okay.

666
00:33:41,784 --> 00:33:43,184
What do you see?

667
00:33:43,219 --> 00:33:45,215
My baby.

668
00:33:45,788 --> 00:33:48,290
My healthy baby.

669
00:33:48,324 --> 00:33:49,970
Where are you?

670
00:33:50,393 --> 00:33:52,097
In New York.

671
00:33:52,582 --> 00:33:55,984
In a cozy nursery. In a cozy apartment.

672
00:33:56,009 --> 00:33:59,158
It doesn't have to be fancy.
I'm not picky.

673
00:33:59,183 --> 00:34:03,483
You can be picky. It's your best life.

674
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:09,210
Okay, so then I have a job that I love,

675
00:34:09,245 --> 00:34:11,613
even if I don't know what that is.

676
00:34:11,647 --> 00:34:14,683
And I can support my family.

677
00:34:17,286 --> 00:34:21,122
And everything's okay.

678
00:34:21,157 --> 00:34:23,670
I have something for you to hear.

679
00:34:47,783 --> 00:34:49,150
Are we getting close?

680
00:34:49,185 --> 00:34:51,586
Yeah, the OR is just through these doors.

681
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,655
Good, okay.

682
00:34:53,689 --> 00:34:56,624
- Do you trust me?
- With my life.

683
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:58,111
- Gun!
- She's got a gun!

684
00:34:58,146 --> 00:34:59,294
Drop your weapon!

685
00:35:01,297 --> 00:35:02,764
Drop your gun!

686
00:35:02,798 --> 00:35:04,199
- Drop your weapon!
- Put it down!

687
00:35:04,233 --> 00:35:06,134
Hands up!

688
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,170
Hands behind you.

689
00:35:09,205 --> 00:35:12,140
David 1-5, we've got one in custody.

690
00:35:12,174 --> 00:35:14,509
Got any more weapons?

691
00:35:14,543 --> 00:35:16,556
Let's go.

692
00:35:26,689 --> 00:35:29,157
- All right.
- Yeah.

693
00:35:29,191 --> 00:35:30,458
All right, folks, it's all over.

694
00:35:30,493 --> 00:35:31,626
Come on in. Let's go.

695
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,031
Come on.

696
00:35:33,529 --> 00:35:35,530
It's all over. That's right.

697
00:35:38,567 --> 00:35:40,635
Hey, hey.

698
00:35:40,669 --> 00:35:43,371
I got you.

699
00:35:51,914 --> 00:35:55,583
You said you don't need
a fancy apartment.

700
00:35:55,618 --> 00:35:58,720
Maybe you can move in with me.

701
00:36:05,428 --> 00:36:07,429
- I love you.
- I love you.

702
00:36:07,463 --> 00:36:10,498
- See you at home.
- Yeah.

703
00:36:14,036 --> 00:36:16,838
So, Tabitha, it goes without saying

704
00:36:16,872 --> 00:36:18,406
that you passed your performance review

705
00:36:18,441 --> 00:36:20,995
with flying colors.

706
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,511
Well, in that spirit,
there's actually something else

707
00:36:23,546 --> 00:36:25,346
I'd love to share with you.

708
00:36:25,381 --> 00:36:26,681
Yeah, of course.

709
00:36:26,715 --> 00:36:28,783
Well, the pattern of your behavior

710
00:36:28,818 --> 00:36:30,718
can actually be indicative

711
00:36:30,753 --> 00:36:34,456
of a more substantive diagnosis
per the DSM-5.

712
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,024
Such as?

713
00:36:36,058 --> 00:36:39,027
Narcissistic personality disorder.

714
00:36:42,731 --> 00:36:44,365
Well...

715
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,767
- have a great night.
- Yeah.

716
00:36:54,743 --> 00:36:56,698
Dr. Bloom...

717
00:36:57,613 --> 00:37:01,616
you are actually
a very decent human being.

718
00:37:02,818 --> 00:37:05,386
Don't tell anyone.

719
00:37:05,421 --> 00:37:07,055
Um...

720
00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:10,420
I thought that...

721
00:37:11,594 --> 00:37:14,591
I could be there for you, but I...

722
00:37:16,098 --> 00:37:18,933
I... I can't.

723
00:37:18,968 --> 00:37:20,969
You were great.

724
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:25,640
I took the pill.

725
00:37:27,776 --> 00:37:30,732
In fact, I took quite a few.

726
00:37:31,614 --> 00:37:34,194
I know what I've done is...

727
00:37:35,618 --> 00:37:37,780
beyond.

728
00:37:38,487 --> 00:37:39,750
I know that I need help.

729
00:37:39,784 --> 00:37:41,356
I've already lost all my family,

730
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,825
and my friend.

731
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:46,895
I can't afford to lose everyone else.

732
00:38:11,554 --> 00:38:13,650
When you finish rehab...

733
00:38:16,992 --> 00:38:18,613
Don't call me.

734
00:38:19,728 --> 00:38:21,950
Don't email me.

735
00:38:22,765 --> 00:38:24,452
Don't text me.

736
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,121
I can't ever see you again.

737
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,832
But you know that, right?

738
00:38:40,082 --> 00:38:42,717
- Stand right here, please.
- All right.

739
00:38:42,751 --> 00:38:44,919
Feet still.

740
00:39:00,536 --> 00:39:02,370
Are you okay?

741
00:39:04,974 --> 00:39:06,374
Thank God those criminals were caught.

742
00:39:06,408 --> 00:39:08,176
Today's been a nightmare.

743
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:11,512
Yeah, well, every day's
a nightmare for those women.

744
00:39:11,547 --> 00:39:13,681
Are you defending them?

745
00:39:13,716 --> 00:39:16,796
Nope. But it's still our job
to help them.

746
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,424
Is it?

747
00:39:33,936 --> 00:39:35,803
Don't scare me like that again.

748
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:40,141
It's all good. I'm right here, baby.

749
00:39:40,175 --> 00:39:42,610
Life's too short for long distance.

750
00:39:42,645 --> 00:39:45,146
I'm turning down the job
in San Francisco.

751
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,743
Don't.

752
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:51,786
San Francisco's sounding
really good right about now.

753
00:39:54,123 --> 00:39:56,591
Let's get out of here.

754
00:40:19,982 --> 00:40:21,749
I'm...

755
00:40:21,784 --> 00:40:24,447
I'm sorry that I put you in danger.

756
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,588
But I didn't know what else to do.

757
00:40:27,623 --> 00:40:29,535
It was the only thing to do.

758
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:32,371
It was brave.

759
00:40:33,228 --> 00:40:35,096
And selfless.

760
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:37,460
Smart. It was you.

761
00:40:38,033 --> 00:40:43,137
And you deserve to be
at a place that sees you,

762
00:40:43,172 --> 00:40:45,134
that appreciates you.

763
00:40:45,641 --> 00:40:47,261
100%.

764
00:40:49,845 --> 00:40:51,179
And if that place isn't New Amsterdam,

765
00:40:51,213 --> 00:40:52,934
then you should go.

766
00:40:53,515 --> 00:40:55,019
You should go.

767
00:40:55,818 --> 00:40:57,518
No matter how much I want you to stay,

768
00:40:57,553 --> 00:40:59,107
and I...

769
00:41:00,155 --> 00:41:04,158
It's not about what I want.

770
00:41:07,162 --> 00:41:09,617
And, yeah, it'll be weird not...

771
00:41:10,332 --> 00:41:12,300
seeing you every day,

772
00:41:12,334 --> 00:41:16,904
and I will miss you, but...

773
00:41:16,939 --> 00:41:18,261
we live in the same city, right?

774
00:41:18,296 --> 00:41:22,543
So we can always get a coffee
or eat, you know, something,

775
00:41:22,578 --> 00:41:24,674
food together, or...

776
00:41:25,347 --> 00:41:27,426
- Max.
- What?

777
00:41:28,684 --> 00:41:29,851
I'm not going anywhere.

778
00:41:29,885 --> 00:41:31,886
You're not?

779
00:41:35,023 --> 00:41:36,824
So you just let me do that whole awkward

780
00:41:36,859 --> 00:41:38,993
rambling speech for no reason?

781
00:41:39,027 --> 00:41:41,983
- Yes.
- Okay, well, great. Thanks.

782
00:41:42,865 --> 00:41:43,831
It's not cool.

783
00:41:50,205 --> 00:41:52,340
So you...

784
00:41:52,374 --> 00:41:54,542
found a reason to stay.

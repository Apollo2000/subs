2
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,279
Hi.

3
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,872
I'm Billy Ray Wetnap
from Pest Boys Exterminators...

4
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,909
...where our motto is,
"There's no bug we can't plug."

5
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,199
And to prove it,
our very own Verminator...

6
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,749
...has volunteered
to get into this glass cage...

7
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,037
...with 10,000
Peruvian stinging beetles.

8
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,679
Stinging beetles?
You said they were gonna be ladybugs.

9
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,672
Now, she is armed with nothing
but her Verminator spray gun...

10
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,232
...filled with our new poison,
RU Dead 42.

11
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,991
It's not working.

12
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,078
The reason that the Peruvian
stinging beetle is so large...

13
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,438
...is that 80 percent of his body weight
is pure D venom.

14
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,470
They don't even lose their stingers
like them sissified African killer bees.

15
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,750
Well, it looks like our very own
Verminator's in a little bit of trouble.

16
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,076
But you won't be if you call Manny,
me or Ma at Pest Boys Exterminators.

17
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,436
Call 1-800-LEGS-UP...

18
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,918
...where our motto is,
"If you wish it, we will squish it."

19
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,356
Well, Ma, it says right here:

20
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,990
"The Peruvian beetle sting
can cause temporary insanity.

21
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,834
But on the bright side,
it has a delightful mating call...

22
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,837
...and stays crunchy in milk."

23
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,431
Well, the doctor said
she seems to be fine.

24
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,791
The pods! The pods!
They're opening!

25
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,349
Is that you, Napoleon?

26
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,993
No, Rhett, it's me.

27
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,950
And mark my words,
the South shall rise again.

28
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,799
Peg.

29
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,152
Peg. Bud.
Man, do I have good news.

30
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,472
Al, aren't you forgetting someone?

31
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,388
Oh, Peg, she's nuts.

32
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,472
Nuts or not,
she is still our daughter.

33
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,631
Oh, all right, Peg.

34
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,597
Hi, pumpkin.

35
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,117
Isn't that cute. I used to call her
pumpkin, now she is one.

36
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,798
But, Peg, anyway, like I was saying,
man, I got good news.

37
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,190
Tomorrow, not only
will I be selling shoes...

38
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,908
...I will be selling ladies' handbags.

39
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,228
That high school diploma
is really starting to pay off.

40
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,911
Anyway, Kelly...

41
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,272
...guess who has the job
of hiring the new employee?

42
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,229
Oh, now, I wouldn't go
ploughing today, Brer Bear.

43
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,237
Let me try this one more time
while the liquor stores are open.

44
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,277
Al, are you trying to tell us...

45
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,193
...that they're gonna put you
in charge of doing the hiring?

46
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,798
Yes, I am. And let us hope I pick more
carefully than I've done in the past.

47
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,871
I must be careful and selective.

48
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,237
I must not hire the first boob
who walks in the door.

49
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,599
You're hired.

50
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,830
Shouldn't I fill out
an application first?

51
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,919
Oh, good idea.

52
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,712
Here you are.

53
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,233
Right over here. Have a seat.
Get off.

54
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,272
You'll be hearing from my lawyer.

55
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,512
Threats don't frighten me.
I'm married.

56
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,473
To my job,
not to some giant big redhead.

57
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,157
Where it says "name,"
do you want mine?

58
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,109
No.
Just a simple naked photo will do.

59
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,715
Well, well, well.

60
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,513
It's true what they say.

61
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,389
Even in hard times
consumers still flock to quality.

62
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,959
Excuse me, Al.

63
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,236
Is this seat taken?

64
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,429
Or this one? Or this one?

65
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,597
Marcie, come here.

66
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,637
Look. There's a woman.

67
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,795
Aren't they something?

68
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,232
So, what do you want?

69
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,109
Jefferson has something to say.
Jefferson?

70
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,957
Yeah, Al, I'm...

71
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,033
I'm here to apply for the j...

72
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,876
- For the j...
- Job! Job! Say it!

73
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,072
I am tired of coming home
every night...

74
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,272
...and finding you watching
the Home Shopping Network.

75
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,078
Look, Marcie, I don't know
the first thing about selling shoes.

76
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,709
Is this the right colour for me?

77
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,716
Absolutely.
It brings out the violet in your eyes.

78
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,716
I'll take 12.

79
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,439
I'm sorry, Marcie. But the job
has already been filled by someone...

80
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,914
...far more qualified.

81
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,517
Mr. Bundy, where it says "date," do
you want his name or where we went?

82
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,511
That's Heidi. She's dumb
as toast, but I'd kill for her.

83
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,273
And I'd start with you.

84
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,799
You piece of algae.

85
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,471
If you think that I am
going to stand idly by...

86
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,679
...and let you hire
some salute to silicone...

87
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,868
...instead of an obviously qualified
person, then you're wrong, Al Bundy.

88
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,193
I'll have my woman's group here so
fast it'll make your bulbous head swim.

89
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,477
My Jefferson is
far more qualified than...

90
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,150
I'm not just a shoe salesman.
I also direct movies for HBO.

91
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,039
Let's go, Jefferson.

92
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,475
Marcie, I thought you wanted me
to get a job.

93
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,717
Your job is pleasing me,
and I am not pleased.

94
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,757
That's my mom.

95
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,360
"Sex." This could take a while.

96
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,596
Can I write on the back?
The front's all full.

97
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,832
Yes, yes. And feel free to move around
if you want to.

98
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,515
I'm here to apply
for the shoe salesman's job.

99
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,955
Job's taken. Get out.

100
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,678
Polk High?

101
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,837
Oh, Polk you're the best
Of all the schools

102
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,355
- For you we'll always cheer
- For you we'll always cheer

103
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,835
- By day we learn to read and write
- By day we learn to read and write

104
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,389
- By night our team will fight, fight, fight
- By night our team will fight, fight, fight

105
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,835
- No matter where we are
- No matter where we are

106
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,116
- We'll always give a.
- We'll always give a.

107
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,715
- For P-O-L-K
- P-O-L-K

108
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,474
- Polk. Polk. Polk
- Polk. Polk. Polk.

109
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,513
Aaron Mitchell. Class of '93.

110
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,991
Al Bundy. All class, all the time.

111
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,877
Wait a second.

112
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,116
Al Bundy?

113
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,718
The All-State Al Bundy?

114
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,468
I was.

115
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,472
- I thought you died in Nam.
- No.

116
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,989
Well, actually, I started that rumour.

117
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,994
Yeah, see, I died here at home,
victim of Agent Red.

118
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,038
Al Bundy. Do you know
what a hero you are to me?

119
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,750
I presume you're referring
to my four touchdowns in one game.

120
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,833
Well, that and the four holes
you drilled into the walls...

121
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,031
...of the girls locker room.

122
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,914
For years I didn't think
women had heads.

123
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,594
- Well, I see you play a little ball.
- No, no, no. You played ball.

124
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,189
I was just All City.
I was lucky to get a scholarship.

125
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,834
- I got a scholarship to college.
- And what happened?

126
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,835
An injury. Tackle broke my leg.
Wife broke her water. The end.

127
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,553
But...

128
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,997
...all things considered, I think
things turned out pretty well.

129
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,198
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

130
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,759
Well, sorry to hear the job's filled...

131
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,077
...but you know, it was worth
the trip here just to meet you.

132
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,238
If it's any consolation, the players
didn't start making big money...

133
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,670
...till after your career
would've been over anyway.

134
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,395
Well, that big shoe money's
still coming down.

135
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,953
Hey, Bundy.

136
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,793
Go deep.

137
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,279
What the hell. You got the job.

138
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,639
Really?

139
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,833
Thanks, Mr. Bundy.

140
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,555
Hey, I don't wanna impose,
but I got my football in the car.

141
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,230
- Would you autograph it for me?
- Sure, kid. Go get it.

142
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,996
Did I just hear you hire
someone else?

143
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,153
Oh, yeah, you did.

144
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,108
- What should I do?
- Well...

145
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,918
Keep writing.

146
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,677
Hi, honey.

147
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,510
Al, I'll tell you,
we just got back from the doctor...

148
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,830
...and he said that she's much better.

149
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,279
Al, what's wrong?
Your face looks strange.

150
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,039
Yeah, it's called a smile, Peg.
But don't worry about it.

151
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,033
I'm not taking it home with me.
Peg, you should see.

152
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,953
I just hired the best kid ever
to help me out in the store.

153
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,237
He's a football hero at Polk High
last year. You should see him.

154
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,153
He's the son I always wanted.

155
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,078
And who's that over there?

156
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,232
Oh, that's the wife I always wanted.

157
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,479
Daddy?

158
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,628
Peg, why can't we just put her
in David Letterman's house...

159
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,432
...and get it over with?

160
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,036
Come on, Kelly.

161
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,637
- And how do we say goodbye?
- Alice, you're the greatest.

162
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,197
I wanna thank you again, Mr. Bundy.

163
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,749
- I really needed this job.
- That's okay. I know.

164
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,319
College is expensive.

165
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,471
Actually, that's pretty much paid for.

166
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,830
I'm using this money to buy a ring
for my girl.

167
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,871
We're gonna get married.

168
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,510
What's wrong with getting married?

169
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,359
Aaron...

170
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,474
...sit down over here, son.
Let's have a chat.

171
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,357
Now, I too am a great believer
in love.

172
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,149
I wanna find it myself someday.

173
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,999
But let me give you
a little bit of advice.

174
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,390
Bed them, don't wed them.

175
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,470
Do them, don't woo them.

176
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,671
Date them, don't mate them.

177
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,158
But Angie's different.

178
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,312
- Well, she...
- Always lets you pick out the movie?

179
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,028
Doesn't mind when you wanna watch
a ballgame?

180
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,795
Can recognize a kitchen appliance
two out of three times?

181
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,628
That's her.

182
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,794
That's all women before the day.

183
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,072
Mr. Bundy, I appreciate your concern,
but I want to get married.

184
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,670
I see now what I have to do.

185
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,473
Come with me.

186
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,392
Where are we going?

187
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,232
The mall lounge.

188
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,553
Or as we like to call it,
"the valley of the shadow of death."

189
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,671
There they are, son.

190
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,431
The lost souls.

191
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,672
The meek, the miserable,
the married.

192
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,078
And over here are the lowest
of the lows.

193
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,312
The ones relegated to holding
their wives' purses.

194
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,711
What's wrong with him?

195
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,317
His wife is shopping
at Victoria's Secret.

196
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,755
She tried on a garter belt last week...

197
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,230
...they haven't seen it since.

198
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,714
And look over there
between Burt and Carson.

199
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,035
Well, it's just an empty space.

200
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,358
With your name on it, Aaron.

201
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,518
Hey, come on, guys.

202
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,558
What could be better
than two people loving each other...

203
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,756
...and sharing the good times
and the bad?

204
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,752
A steak?

205
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,114
Fellas...

206
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,920
...what we've got here
is a non-believer.

207
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,831
A little marrying music, please.

208
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,032
My wife will never cook or clean

209
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,316
Still my money's spent

210
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,639
Who knew when I first chose my mate

211
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,394
That she would put on
That much weight

212
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,835
More sex we'd lik e for sure

213
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,548
If it only weren't with her

214
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,872
Please K-l-L-L
K-l-L-L

215
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,036
Me, me, me

216
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,833
That's the marrying man's
fight song, son.

217
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,877
That and taps.

218
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,072
Good luck, Aaron.

219
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,390
Thanks. It's much easier to fill this out
with the light on.

220
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,072
Take your time.

221
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,798
Hello. Is Aaron here?

222
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,510
- I just came by to bring his lunch.
- Oh, thanks.

223
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,834
You must be Angie.

224
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,239
- His fiancיe.
- Well, yes.

225
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,996
You don't have to say it. I know.
I'm the luckiest girl in the world.

226
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,028
Oh, but not as lucky as he is,
I'm sure.

227
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,831
Why, he tells me you don't mind
when he watches sports.

228
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,749
Which I think is good
because there's...

229
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,595
There's a game on tonight and
I thought maybe I'd invite him over...

230
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,159
...to watch it.

231
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,752
Oh, I'm sure he'd love to.

232
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,117
I'd watch it with you,
but I have a cooking class tonight.

233
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,749
You like football and cooking?

234
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,830
Sure. What woman doesn't?

235
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,639
But...

236
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,915
...l'll bet you like to eat, huh?

237
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,035
Well, sure.

238
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,751
You know, fruit, vegetables.

239
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,795
My big weakness
is the Roy Rogers salad bar.

240
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,156
Not that the food is bad,
I just feel guilty...

241
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,960
...about spending $1.99 on myself.

242
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,189
Don't take this personally,
but would you marry me?

243
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,830
My wife wouldn't like it,
but she doesn't like anything I like.

244
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,872
You're cute.

245
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,118
Well, I better go
or I'll be late for work.

246
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,074
You work?

247
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,108
What else am I gonna do?

248
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,035
Sit around the house all day
watching Oprah and eating bonbons?

249
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,633
Well, at least I still have...

250
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,118
A chair.

251
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,392
Where a beautiful girl once sat.

252
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,356
I need shoes.

253
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,839
Peg?

254
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,798
Oprah.

255
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,871
You know, Peg, I made a mistake.

256
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,749
This morning before I left I thought
that all women were totally useless.

257
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,639
Now I realize it was just you.

258
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,952
I thought all men were destined
to marry the worst possible mate...

259
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,636
...but I now realize it was just me.

260
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,236
Oh, hi, Al.

261
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,112
I didn't hear you.
I was watching Oprah.

262
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,193
That's all right, Peg.
I was talking to Oprah.

263
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,359
But, you know what
I'm going to do now?

264
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,670
I'm going to live the life
I should have had...

265
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,838
...vicariously through Aaron.

266
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,548
And I'm going to live my sports life
through him.

267
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,394
I'm going to have dinner
through him.

268
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,596
And if he'll let me, I'm even
going to have sex through him.

269
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,270
Oh, hi, Al.

270
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,873
I didn't hear you.
I was watching Oprah.

271
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,396
If only Oprah were on
when I said, "I do."

272
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,032
- I'll get it.
- No, I'll get it, Daddy.

273
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,077
- Oh, hi, pumpkin.
- Hi.

274
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,710
- How you feeling?
- I'm fine. I'm all better.

275
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,076
Thattagirl.

276
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,190
- Hi.
- Hi. Is Mr. Bundy here?

277
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,473
You're that good football guy
everyone's talking about.

278
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,517
Yeah, and what's your name?

279
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,591
Thumbelina!

280
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,152
Book 'em, Dano.

281
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,992
A great daughter.
You must be very proud.

282
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,312
I'd sell her for scrap if I could.
What's going on?

283
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,239
I just stopped by to thank you
for setting me straight.

284
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,916
You made me realize that I shouldn't
jump into marriage.

285
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,073
So I broke off my engagement
with Angie.

286
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,878
And decided to go back to the girl
I dated all through high school.

287
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,997
And I want you to meet her.

288
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,358
Mr. Bundy, I'd like you to meet Meg.

289
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,712
Oprah!

290
00:22:50,305 --> 00:23:50,384

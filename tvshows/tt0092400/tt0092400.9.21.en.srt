2
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,681
Look at it, Jefferson.

3
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,769
The elegance, the form,
the sheer grace of motion.

4
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,643
The triumph of the human spirit.

5
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:28,081
<i>And now, on Monster Trucking:</i>

6
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:35,320
<i>Tyrannosaurus Wreck will attempt
to mow over nine flaming prison buses.</i>

7
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:41,723
Boy, PBS has really changed
since the Republicans took over.

8
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,408
Hey.

9
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,161
- Mail's here.
- What'd we get?

10
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,089
Well, you've got bills.

11
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,766
I got fan mail.

12
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,045
Oh, and I think we all know
what little handyman...

13
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,882
<i>...gets Self Touchers Quarterly.</i>

14
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,800
And this is for you.

15
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,449
Oh, a letter from
the Office of Bingo Affairs.

16
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,045
No doubt a part
of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco...

17
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,844
...and Useless
Blood-Sucking Spouses.

18
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:25,008
Al, I have been invited
to the Windy City Bingo Invitational.

19
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,962
You know what this means?

20
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,843
The couch is in danger
of flying away?

21
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,164
This is the World Series of bingo.

22
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,567
Top prize is $10,000.

23
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,528
Well, I think it's exciting, Peggy.

24
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,045
So you'll come to the tournament
with me?

25
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,401
Oh, well, I would...

26
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,365
...but I can't. You see, bingo
brings up sad memories for me.

27
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,528
I had a dog named Bingo once...

28
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,883
...who died a tragic death.

29
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,162
I thought you had a cat named Gringo
that lived to be a hundred.

30
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,358
Well, then I guess I can go.

31
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,805
Thank you so much, honey pot.

32
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,760
Peggy, do I have time to go home
and freshen up and amend my will?

33
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,521
Sure. The tournament
isn't until next Tuesday.

34
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,558
Don't worry, Al, this isn't
gonna cost you one red cent.

35
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,038
Good.

36
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,366
Give me $300.

37
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,478
What for?

38
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,442
- Bingo clothes.
- You--

39
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,245
Here, you Denver boot of a woman.

40
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,408
Hey, Peg, don't forget about dinner.

41
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,167
Steak? Sounds great. Thank you.

42
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,602
Bingo invitational.
Jeez, the things that excite women.

43
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:52,799
<i>And now a word from our sponsor,
Girlie Girl Beer.</i>

44
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,519
The official beer of NO MA'AM.

45
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,159
I hope this where
the girls are washing their cars...

46
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,247
...and they turn their hoses
on each other.

47
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,725
I hope it's the one
where the girls are studying...

48
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,398
...and then they turn the hoses
on each other.

49
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,724
<i>Hi, I'm Yoko Ono...</i>

50
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:17,282
<i>...the new spokeshuman
for Girlie Girl Beer.</i>

51
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:21,367
<i>Because we care
about the environment...</i>

52
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,324
<i>...Girlie Girl Beer will donate
one nickel per case...</i>

53
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,522
<i>...to save our vanishing rain forests.</i>

54
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:33,599
<i>And now, a song I've written.</i>

55
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,527
Jefferson, give me the remote.

56
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,080
It wasn't enough breaking up
the Beatles.

57
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,679
Now she's ruined our beer.

58
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,569
Jefferson, call an emergency meeting
of the troops.

59
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,598
NO MA'AM must pick a
new official beer.

60
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,483
What's going on in the garage?

61
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:33,162
Your father and the flab four are trying
to come up with a new official beer.

62
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,641
You mean they finished their search
for the official pork rind?

63
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,562
Peg?

64
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,685
We need something to cleanse
the palate between beers.

65
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,763
Have you tried toothpaste?

66
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,923
No, Peg. Toothpaste is for people
who kiss, smile or eat.

67
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,762
Well, if you kissed, you might eat.

68
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,045
Yeah, but I wouldn't smile.

69
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,647
"Do not sell after 1989."

70
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,565
Hell, I'm not selling, I'm eating.

71
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,240
Hey, listen, Dad.

72
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,162
As an outsider of NO MA'AM...

73
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,805
...and if there's a God, this family...

74
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,320
...why do a bunch of guys who are bleary
when sober need an official beer?

75
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,088
Bud.

76
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,890
While NO MA'AM
may look like a loose assortment...

77
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,843
...of foot pads, rakes
and rapscallions...

78
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,599
...we are, in fact,
a proud order of dignified men...

79
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,723
...who serve our community
with honor and panache.

80
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,161
Hey, Al. Come quick.

81
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,565
Ike's got an atomic fireball
stuck up his nose!

82
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:50,560
Again? Didn't he learn his lesson
from the corn dog?

83
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,127
- Get the video camera.
- And the Dirt Devil?

84
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,161
No, she's reading.

85
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,321
Al.

86
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:03,764
Just how long are you guys gonna be
Jim Carreying around in there?

87
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,682
I need a ride
to the bingo tournament.

88
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,127
No, Peg. We're picking a beer.

89
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,045
Can't you hitch a ride
on Marcie's poultry wagon?

90
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,649
Al, the church is in
a very dangerous neighborhood.

91
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,802
What could happen, Peg,
a drive-by plucking?

92
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,168
Fine. Then don't take me.

93
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,964
But I'm gonna just bust up
your little beer party here...

94
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,360
...and ask some stupid questions
about sports.

95
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,443
Oh, get in the car, Peg.

96
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,365
And don't forget.
You gotta pick me up at 9:00.

97
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:37,040
- Fine.
- Al! Look!

98
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,601
We've got British ale.

99
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:45,445
Men, don't forget.
British ale must be served warm.

100
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,926
This is charming, Peggy.

101
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,722
Thanks for inviting me.

102
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,889
And the women are wearing
my favorite scent: dust.

103
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,844
Oh, just relax, Marcie.
This is gonna be fun.

104
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,480
Sit down and soak up the ambiance.

105
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,967
There is now an open chair
at table nine.

106
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:27,881
Maybe I'll just play
with one of these.

107
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,289
Touch that marker...

108
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,800
...and you're gonna be eating
through a straw like the rest of us.

109
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,926
Oh, well...

110
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:43,119
...I guess I'll just sit here
until Al comes to pick us up...

111
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:46,165
...seven hours from now.

112
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,038
Squeak that chair one more time...

113
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,879
...and you'll wish you were never born
like the rest of us!

114
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,805
I-28.

115
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:10,922
Peggy, I'm feeling a little
uncomfortable around Brunhilda here.

116
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,527
Oh, that's just Ceil.

117
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,806
She's really nice
once you get to know her.

118
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,648
Offer her a potato chip.

119
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,081
G-57.

120
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,043
Would you like a chip?

121
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,649
Back to business.

122
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,966
Beer will be judged by nose,
body, taste and color of exit.

123
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,961
And remember, no drinking.

124
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:53,719
We will sip, swish and spit.

125
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,246
I'll sip and spit,
but I ain't gonna swish.

126
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,965
You'll swish and like it.

127
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,363
We will now commence with
the official NO MA'AM beer tasting.

128
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,205
Jefferson, would you do
the honors, please?

129
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,919
Gladly.

130
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:15,839
Now, our first candidate
comes from Asia Minor...

131
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:20,362
...is made from agave
and bladderwort.

132
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,768
All right.

133
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:47,163
Our next beer is a fine Afghani ale...

134
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:52,525
...whose name loosely translated
means "yellow mountain runoff."

135
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,247
Oh, hey, look.

136
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,645
There's a prize in every can.

137
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,563
I'd be careful about that prize stuff.

138
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,762
Remember what fell out
of that Chernobyl beer.

139
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:12,689
What? That was an olive, right?

140
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,322
Sure, with an eyebrow.

141
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,758
All right, all right, all right, all right.

142
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,683
Let's forget about
this wimpy foreign beer.

143
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,450
We're Americans.
Let's drink American.

144
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,805
What's our first American beer?

145
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,723
Dos Equis!

146
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,882
N-41.

147
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,640
Peggy, I don't think
I can sit here any longer.

148
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,886
Shut up.

149
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,165
Just relax, Marcie.
This is the last game.

150
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:56,168
Whoever wins this one
gets the big jackpot.

151
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,287
Shut up!

152
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,606
G-58.

153
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,568
Look, Peggy, all you need
is one more square.

154
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,285
Yeah. But I never win anything.
I just play for fun.

155
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,641
N-33.

156
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,324
Bingo! Bingo!

157
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,687
Oh, my God, bingo!

158
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,127
Congratulations, Peggy!

159
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,281
Shut up!

160
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:32,609
Ladies and gentlemen,
the winner of the $10,000 grand prize...

161
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,045
...Mrs. Peggy Bundy.

162
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,569
Oh, Peggy, what are you gonna do
with $10,000?

163
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:46,324
Well, I think I'll give it to the needy.

164
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,725
Of course, I "needy" it all.

165
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,247
It's 9:00.
Al should be pulling up soon.

166
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,926
Wait, Al, look it's 9:00.

167
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,327
When are we gonna stop sipping
and start drinking some of this stuff?

168
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,722
Yeah, all this beer foreplay
is making me thirsty.

169
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,521
What's foreplay?

170
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,685
About 10 seconds.

171
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,198
Then what's sex?

172
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,805
All right, men. Focus, men, focus.

173
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,407
All right, from now on
we'll each drink a little beer.

174
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,125
But remember,
we must still show decorum.

175
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,680
- Claudia Schiffer.
- Pamela Anderson.

176
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,848
- Claudia Schiffer.
- Pamela Anderson.

177
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,966
What is the problem?

178
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,560
You guys haven't thrown
a frigging punch.

179
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,445
Hey, Al. I don't wanna box anymore.

180
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,443
Let's dance.

181
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,970
When you were dancing,
you wanted to box.

182
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,644
Oh, but-- But when I was dancing...

183
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,205
...I didn't get to lead.

184
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,040
Get out there, you big happy boy.

185
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,727
Hey, Jefferson, I got a bad feeling.

186
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,285
Well, heck, you had about 40 beers.

187
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,720
It's-- It's a wonder
you can feel anything.

188
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:37,681
No, I think I was supposed
to do something around 9:00.

189
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,638
What time is it?

190
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:45,842
- It's 10:15.
- Oh, then I probably already done it.

191
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:52,201
Hey, Bob Rooney. Go to the kidneys.
Go to the kidneys.

192
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,359
Go to the bathroom.
Go to the bathroom.

193
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:07,568
Well, staying true
to his performance in bed...

194
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:12,167
...I think it's safe to say
that Al has let me down again.

195
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,967
Unfortunately, in this case...

196
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:18,242
...I can't just reach into the night stand
and get myself home.

197
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:27,600
Well, thank goodness
we're in the comfort of a church.

198
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,523
Ladies, I gotta lock up. Get out.

199
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,088
I thought this was a sanctuary.

200
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:37,369
Yeah, until 11. After that,
it's just another crime scene.

201
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:41,088
You don't understand.
We don't have a ride home...

202
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,366
...and we're carrying
$10,000 in cash.

203
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:46,721
Now, if you make us leave, there's
no telling what will happen to us.

204
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:50,002
Oh, I know exactly
what would happen to you.

205
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:55,241
But luckily, doctors today
can reattach almost anything.

206
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,320
Take me.
Would you believe this isn't my real--?

207
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:01,721
Peggy! I think we should call a cab.

208
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,128
You'll never get a cab
this time of night.

209
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,208
You could get one in the morning...

210
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,964
...if you wouldn't mind shacking up
with me.

211
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:16,606
I got a hot plate
and some macaroni and cheese.

212
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:18,998
Marcie?

213
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,279
Look, dream date.

214
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:27,130
There's gotta be another way
out of here.

215
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,999
There is one other way.
My cousin Elmo drives a gypsy cab.

216
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:34,566
He can come and get you for $200.

217
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:38,685
I can't believe you are ripping us off
in a sacred place.

218
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,482
God is gonna get you.

219
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:44,641
Yeah, there's so much more
he can take from me.

220
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:52,127
Well, we are not paying $200 for a cab,
you cave-dwelling pirate.

221
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,605
Suit yourself, bucko.

222
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,161
Sorry for the bumpy ride.

223
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,646
It's hard to steer
when you're coming off drugs.

224
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,884
Hey, watch out!

225
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,640
Damn jogger.

226
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,402
Don't you think
you should turn your headlights on?

227
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:28,888
Nope, but feel free to turn on yours.

228
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,642
I should report him. What's his name?

229
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:37,641
"Dan Rostenkowski"?

230
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:43,765
Why are you stopping?

231
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,882
Well, you see this thing here
on my leg?

232
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,724
I go two more blocks,
I'll violate my parole...

233
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,239
...we all explode together.

234
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,881
Which is something
I've been hankering for...

235
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:58,719
...since you two hot mamas
slid into my cab.

236
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,680
- I think we'll just get out here.
- Fine.

237
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,882
My buddy Abdula
will take you the rest of the way.

238
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:12,159
I find driving to be
a really Zen experience.

239
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,080
I think the faster you go,
the faster you get there.

240
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:21,800
I never knew a Geo Metro
could go 140 miles an hour.

241
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:27,049
Yeah. They corner great too. Watch.

242
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:35,242
What a relief to be in a normal cab.

243
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,128
You seem like a nice person.

244
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,890
Well, I love my work.

245
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:45,207
- How long have you been driving?
- Seventy-two hours... straight.

246
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,888
Driving's helped me forget about
the two-timing dirty dog...

247
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,684
...who left me and took everything.

248
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,523
I'll have the last laugh
when he finds out I wrapped his cab...

249
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,449
...around a telephone pole,
wearing his favorite shirt.

250
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:04,239
I got your,
"She was only making the bed."

251
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:26,048
So where's Dad
and the rest of the lawn sprinklers?

252
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,566
Well, the last time I saw,
Buck was giving them all sleigh rides.

253
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,242
<i>The horror.</i>

254
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,169
<i>The unspeakable horror.</i>

255
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:52,845
- Claudia Schiffer.
- Tastes great.

256
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,964
Oh, look, my children.

257
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:04,440
What's-her-name and
Don't-worry-about-me-I'm-on-the-pill.

258
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,682
Bud. Kelly.

259
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:13,439
When your mother asks about this,
and she will...

260
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:18,844
...you tell her we just tasted one beer
and went right to sheep.

261
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,287
What if she asks
why you didn't pick up your wife?

262
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,805
You just tell her
because she was too heavy.

263
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,526
Hey, pookie.

264
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,969
How was bingo?

265
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:42,685
It was great, Al. I won the $10,000.

266
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,081
Ten thousand dollars, Peg?

267
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,558
Let me see it.

268
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,967
This is only three bucks.

269
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,882
Well, that's all we had left...

270
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:05,045
...after fighting our way north
via the underground railroad!

271
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:10,485
- Thank your father, kids.
- Thanks, Dad.

272
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:13,483
All this for new official beer.

273
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,559
That's what we forgot to do.

274
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,721
Pick a new official beer.

275
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,482
How about Girlie Girl?

276
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,880
- Hear, hear!
- Good choice.

277
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:28,524
Hey, boy, that was easy.

278
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,968
Where were we?

279
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:35,402
Hey, I know. You guys stay put.

280
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:37,402
I'll be right back.

281
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:40,727
Al, it's 9:00. Where are you going?

282
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,122
Yeah. I gotta go pick up the wife.

283
00:21:45,305 --> 00:22:45,387

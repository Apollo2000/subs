Let go of my hair,
you little psychopath! 

21
00:01:31,734 --> 00:01:34,000
Die, commie bimbo.

22
00:01:35,367 --> 00:01:38,400
Now, Bud, I thought
we talked about this before.

23
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,000
What's that, Mom?

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Sneaking up
behind your sister,

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,834
pulling her hair,
pretending to kill her.

26
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:46,434
Remember the effect
it had on Grandma?

27
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,234
Nobody likes it,
nobody thinks it's funny.

28
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:51,767
So cut it out, okay?

29
00:01:51,767 --> 00:01:52,868
Sure, Mom.

30
00:01:52,868 --> 00:01:54,267
Now go to school.

31
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:56,567
[HORN HONKS]

32
00:01:56,567 --> 00:01:58,267
I hate you.

33
00:01:58,267 --> 00:01:59,300
Good.

34
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:03,267
Hey, hon.
Anything going on?

35
00:02:03,267 --> 00:02:04,300
Nope.

36
00:02:05,934 --> 00:02:08,934
Sweetie, is this
your little cactus?

37
00:02:08,934 --> 00:02:10,267
Uh-huh.

38
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:11,634
Any particular reason

39
00:02:11,634 --> 00:02:15,701
you put it where
the alarm clock used to be?

40
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:20,234
I thought it would dress up
the room a little bit.

41
00:02:20,234 --> 00:02:22,167
Gee, I meant to tell
you to be careful

42
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:24,367
before you slammed your hand
on the alarm this morning.

43
00:02:24,367 --> 00:02:25,534
Well, you didn't.

44
00:02:25,534 --> 00:02:26,667
Sorry.

45
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:27,834
That's okay.

46
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:30,701
I stopped the bleeding
with your slip.

47
00:02:32,634 --> 00:02:33,834
Where are the kids?

48
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:35,133
They've left.

49
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:38,601
By the way, Bud has
show and tell at school today.

50
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:40,567
The subject is,
"What does daddy do?"

51
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:42,033
So when you come home tonight,

52
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:43,467
if there's a can
of beer missing,

53
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:45,300
and you can't find
the remote control,

54
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,734
that's where they are.

55
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:49,267
I hope he brings
that stuff back tonight.

56
00:02:49,267 --> 00:02:50,934
The Bulls are playing on TV.

57
00:02:50,934 --> 00:02:53,200
Oh, my God.
You're kidding.

58
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,701
It's not as exciting as your
 <i>Cookin' with Clyde the Cajun,</i>

59
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:59,901
but at least it gives me
a reason to come home.

60
00:02:59,901 --> 00:03:03,033
Al, do you have to leave
the refrigerator door open?

61
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:05,200
I'm getting a draft.

62
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,567
I'm sorry. Maybe I should look
for some food in the dishwasher.

63
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:12,400
We have no juice.

64
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,400
I didn't buy any.
I didn't have time.

65
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,701
That happens.
I understand.

66
00:03:16,701 --> 00:03:21,267
You don't have a job
or anything, do you?

67
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,267
Well, I do sandpaper the stains
out of your shirts

68
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:25,734
and battle your socks
and underwear

69
00:03:25,734 --> 00:03:27,567
into the washing machine,

70
00:03:27,567 --> 00:03:30,133
but I guess that is more
of an adventure than a job.

71
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:32,000
What has that got
to do with juice?

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,367
Al, there's a store
on your way home from work.

73
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:36,501
I'm sorry.
Why didn't I think of that?

74
00:03:36,501 --> 00:03:39,000
Sure. I don't mind
doing the shopping too.

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,534
Anything else I can do
to make your life easier?

76
00:03:41,534 --> 00:03:43,434
You could shave
your back.

77
00:03:46,033 --> 00:03:49,033
Hey, that hair is there
for a reason.

78
00:03:49,033 --> 00:03:51,901
It keeps you off
of me at night.

79
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,701
Al, let's not start.

80
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,234
We were having
such a nice morning.

81
00:03:56,234 --> 00:03:58,634
Yeah, I'm sorry.
You're right.

82
00:03:58,634 --> 00:04:01,067
It's just that I got
a hard day ahead of me

83
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:02,834
and nothing to eat
to get me going.

84
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:05,300
I'm sorry, honey.
It's my fault.

85
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,467
Tonight, I promise,
there will be food in the house.

86
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:10,534
And juice.

87
00:04:10,534 --> 00:04:11,734
Right.

88
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:12,901
Those kids.

89
00:04:12,901 --> 00:04:15,834
I hate wasting food.

90
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:19,667
Yes, my little baby.

91
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,067
Have a nice day, honey.

92
00:04:30,968 --> 00:04:33,834
There better be juice
when I get home.

93
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:44,167
I don't care what
your little ruler says.

94
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:47,534
I've been a 7 since I graduated
from high school.

95
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:50,133
Well, these are 7s.

96
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:53,133
The box says 9
because, well, uh...

97
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:55,300
Look, lady.
You're a 9.

98
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:59,400
I can accept it.
Why can't you?

99
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,167
You're very fresh!

100
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:02,501
No, ma'am,
that's impossible,

101
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:04,133
because
for the last hour,

102
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:06,267
I've been trying to squeeze
your foot into a shoe,

103
00:05:06,267 --> 00:05:08,968
when I really should have
been easing them into the box.

104
00:05:08,968 --> 00:05:11,367
I'd say I'm anything
but fresh.

105
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:13,868
By the way, you want
to tell John Henry there

106
00:05:13,868 --> 00:05:16,868
to give the $100
pumps a rest?

107
00:05:16,868 --> 00:05:20,234
Your ad says
"Courteous service."

108
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:22,167
That's not my ad, ma'am.

109
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:23,667
That's the former owner's.

110
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:26,167
He was killed, tragically,
on this very spot

111
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:29,667
when a size 9
exploded in his face.

112
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:32,167
Come on, Arnold.
We're leaving.

113
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:33,667
I want a balloon.

114
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,033
You've already
got one.

115
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:43,968
Hey, Al. You mind
if I go to lunch?

116
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,968
You just came
from lunch.

117
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:47,234
Yeah, technically.

118
00:05:47,234 --> 00:05:50,133
Biologically, I was
in bed with some broad.

119
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:52,667
Luke, how can
you be happy

120
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:55,167
sleeping with every
woman you meet?

121
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:58,300
I don't know,
but I am.

122
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,901
I'll tell you,
as your friend,

123
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,801
I can't wait till you
get married.

124
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:04,801
Yeah. A wife and kids
who adore you.

125
00:06:04,801 --> 00:06:05,968
A wife...

126
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:07,133
Kids...

127
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,634
The list goes on and on.

128
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:11,868
It's just seeing their faces
light up in the morning

129
00:06:11,868 --> 00:06:13,234
when they see you.

130
00:06:13,234 --> 00:06:15,100
They can't do enough for you.

131
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,300
It's heaven on earth.

132
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,300
No, Al. That is.

133
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:22,968
Luke Ventura,
at your feet.

134
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,701
Do you work here,

135
00:06:27,701 --> 00:06:29,701
or are you
just loitering?

136
00:06:29,701 --> 00:06:31,200
I'm sorry.
Can I help you?

137
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,501
I'd like to see
some shoes, please.

138
00:06:35,534 --> 00:06:36,968
Uh, let me guess.

139
00:06:36,968 --> 00:06:39,501
Uh...size 7s.

140
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:41,467
Yes. How did you know?

141
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,234
All women are 7s.

142
00:06:46,634 --> 00:06:49,634
I know you've been
told this before,

143
00:06:49,634 --> 00:06:52,234
but you have the instep
of a movie star.

144
00:06:52,234 --> 00:06:54,300
Really?

145
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,300
Hey, Al. Meet Tawny.

146
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,634
Al's married.

147
00:06:57,634 --> 00:06:59,534
[BOTH LAUGH]

148
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:03,067
Listen, Al,
I forgot to tell you.

149
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:05,167
I got an extra ticket to
the Bulls/Lakers game tonight.

150
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:06,767
Court level.
Want to go?

151
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:07,934
Hell, yeah!

152
00:07:07,934 --> 00:07:09,400
Sure your wife
will let you?

153
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,667
Let me tell you something.

154
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:12,868
No woman tells
Al Bundy what to do.

155
00:07:12,868 --> 00:07:15,467
Hey, you.
Get my shoes.

156
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:16,501
Yes, ma'am.

00:14:04,734 --> 00:14:06,234
Hello.
I'm Marcie.

322
00:14:06,234 --> 00:14:07,400
I'm Steve.

323
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,868
You have
a beautiful home.

324
00:14:08,868 --> 00:14:11,067
Yeah, so do you.
Come on in.

325
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,767
Howdy, neighbor!

326
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:16,100
Yeah, yeah.
I hate these people.

327
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,601
Why don't
we sit down.

328
00:14:17,601 --> 00:14:19,634
Gee, you know,
I'm kind of embarrassed.

329
00:14:19,634 --> 00:14:22,467
I have nothing
to serve you.

330
00:14:22,467 --> 00:14:24,033
Listen,
if you're hungry,

331
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:26,400
there's a store
a few blocks away.

332
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,400
If you're going,
get me some juice, okay?

333
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,801
Al's only kidding.

334
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:32,200
He's just upset because

335
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,901
I didn't have time
to do the shopping.

336
00:14:33,901 --> 00:14:35,901
You know,
Steve and I

337
00:14:35,901 --> 00:14:38,734
decided to share
the household chores.

338
00:14:38,734 --> 00:14:40,400
Gee, that's great.

339
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,300
You see, Al.
Steve helps around the house.

340
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,868
Way to go, Steve.

341
00:14:46,434 --> 00:14:48,334
Say, listen,
who do you like

342
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:51,033
to win the NBA championship
this year?

343
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:54,334
Well, Al...
to tell you the truth,

344
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:56,701
since we got married,

345
00:14:56,701 --> 00:14:58,701
I don't watch
much sports.

346
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:00,200
Marcie doesn't like it,

347
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,400
and we decided we'll only
do things we both like.

348
00:15:04,901 --> 00:15:08,100
I feel that sports glorify
violence and competition,

349
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,601
and I don't think it's
psychologically healthy.

350
00:15:10,601 --> 00:15:13,234
When we have a child,
we don't want it to grow up

351
00:15:13,234 --> 00:15:15,534
with that "winning
is the only thing" attitude.

352
00:15:15,534 --> 00:15:19,934
A child is better off
not being exposed to sports.

353
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:21,634
You gonna neuter him too?

354
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,601
Do you two have any kids?

355
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:28,601
Two.

356
00:15:28,601 --> 00:15:29,901
Where are they?

357
00:15:29,901 --> 00:15:31,267
I don't know.

358
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,667
So, Steve...

359
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:40,100
looks like life is really
shaping up for you two.

360
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,601
How long you two crazy kids
been married?

361
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:44,067
Two months, Al.

362
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:45,667
Well, Marcie,
looks like you got

363
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:49,534
a heck of a piece of clay
to work with.

364
00:15:51,801 --> 00:15:54,133
We've been married
15 years.

365
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:55,868
Well, what's
your secret?

366
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:58,100
Oh, no secret, really.

367
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,200
Just to be considerate, accept
each other for what you are,

368
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,834
don't point out the fact

369
00:16:02,834 --> 00:16:04,701
that the hair
he's losing on his head

370
00:16:04,701 --> 00:16:06,267
is now growing
out of his nose.

371
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,467
And his ears.

372
00:16:16,501 --> 00:16:19,000
And accepting the fact
that nowadays

373
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,501
it's harder to figure out
where her chest ends

374
00:16:22,501 --> 00:16:23,868
and her stomach begins.

375
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:29,234
I'll get us
some coffee, Marcie.

376
00:16:29,234 --> 00:16:30,367
I'll help.

377
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:31,400
Me too.

378
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,901
Hey. You know
another thing

379
00:16:32,901 --> 00:16:36,067
that makes women
such a blessing to us?

380
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:38,567
It's like when you're
sitting somewhere,

381
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:41,067
and they come over
and they say to you,

382
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,100
"What are you
thinking?"

383
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,601
And you
start thinking...

384
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:47,100
"You know, if I wanted
you to know,

385
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,467
I'd be talking."

386
00:16:53,934 --> 00:16:56,434
Isn't that
an awful lot of coffee

387
00:16:56,434 --> 00:16:57,934
you're putting in there?

388
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,167
Yes.

389
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:00,634
That's for them.

390
00:17:00,634 --> 00:17:02,133
Ours will be good.

391
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:03,901
You see,
if they enjoy

392
00:17:03,901 --> 00:17:05,634
eating and drinking
at home too much,

393
00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:07,400
they never
take you anywhere.

394
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,501
With men, if you ask them
for something,

395
00:17:11,501 --> 00:17:13,000
you are never
gonna get it.

396
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But if you
do some damage

397
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,501
to their
internal organs,

398
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:17,868
you got a shot.

399
00:17:19,634 --> 00:17:21,634
And if it
doesn't work...

400
00:17:21,634 --> 00:17:23,067
what have you lost?

401
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:25,434
Could you fill this
with tap water, please.

402
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:29,701
Well, I have
to be honest.

403
00:17:29,701 --> 00:17:32,968
So far, Steve has been
the ideal husband.

404
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,167
Oh, really?

405
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:36,400
I bet the first couple
of weeks you were married,

406
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,968
you went to bed
at the same time.

407
00:17:38,968 --> 00:17:40,267
Oh, yes.

408
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,934
Have you noticed how
in the last month or so,

409
00:17:42,934 --> 00:17:46,334
he seems to be going to bed
a little later and later?

410
00:17:46,334 --> 00:17:47,868
Why, yes.

411
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:52,300
How did you know?

412
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,934
You're letting him
slip away, Marcie.

413
00:17:54,934 --> 00:17:57,567
You've got
a good thing going.

414
00:17:57,567 --> 00:18:00,534
Don't start letting him
have a good time alone.

415
00:18:00,534 --> 00:18:03,033
But we still have
a good time together.

416
00:18:03,033 --> 00:18:05,434
Then why is he
staying up?

417
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,901
I'm telling you,
your son is gonna be a sissy

418
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:14,901
if you let that woman

419
00:18:14,901 --> 00:18:16,267
take away your sports.

420
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:22,634
I used to love sports.

421
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,067
Of course you did.

422
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:25,567
You're a man.

423
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:27,501
But, Steve...

424
00:18:27,501 --> 00:18:29,501
you can love it again.

425
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:32,667
Start with me
right now, Steve.

426
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:35,667
Turn on that TV.

427
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:38,167
I can't do it
for you.

428
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:39,901
Turn it on...

429
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:41,300
Settle back...

430
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,367
Relax...

431
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:45,434
and watch sports.

00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:05,634
he's been getting up
earlier than me too.

No.

00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,367
We haven't been

484
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:45,067
to The Captain's
Table in a long time.

485
00:21:45,067 --> 00:21:47,067
We always
like it there.

486
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:49,601
They have
such a nice menu.

487
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:50,934
Yeah.

488
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,100
You want to go
upstairs?

489
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,267
I thought you wanted
to watch the game.

490
00:21:58,267 --> 00:21:59,501
Nah!

491
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:00,801
Who cares?

492
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,968
You know, I like
the coffee there too.

493
00:22:25,534 --> 00:22:28,868

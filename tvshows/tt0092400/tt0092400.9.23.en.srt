2
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,793
Hi, Mom.

3
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,077
Hi, Bud. How was work?

4
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,713
You know the line on the floor
of the vehicle services office...

5
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,275
...that takes you from the eye test
to the road test?

6
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,272
I like that line.

7
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,918
Well, last week my boss
hired his nephew to repaint it.

8
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,152
- That sounds easy.
- Yeah, sure...

9
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,272
...for those of us who aren't
20 minutes out of rehab.

10
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,873
The glue-meister, however,
decided to paint his line...

11
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,470
...straight from the front door
right to automatic renewals.

12
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,518
I just hope we caught it
before it caused any real damage.

13
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,115
<i>And today on
the Eisenhower Expressway...</i>

14
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,151
<i>...there was a 78 car pile-up...</i>

15
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,750
<i>...caused by a 5-year-old
manning a cement mixer.</i>

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,595
<i>The driver, who was identified
only as Timmy, was not arrested...</i>

17
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,951
<i>...because he had
a valid driver's license.</i>

18
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,232
Hey, Peg.

19
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,397
Did you see the horrible news?

20
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,438
Yeah. A 78 car pile-up.

21
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,198
<i>No, not that news. Shoe News.</i>

22
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,240
<i>Shoe News is the only publication that
reaches the entire shoe community.</i>

23
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,239
<i>Well, that and Big 'Uns.</i>

24
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,717
But look,
Luke Ventura got his name...

25
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,753
- ...and his picture in it.
- Who's Luke Ventura?

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,560
He's some guy who used to work
with me at Gary's Shoes.

27
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,918
He was always sucking up to the boss
and brownnosing.

28
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,714
He worked overtime,
he was polite to the customers...

29
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,872
...and he actually sold a shoe
from time to time.

30
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,113
Yeah.

31
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,270
But look at the luck
the SOB is having.

32
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,193
Peg, that should be
my picture in there.

33
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,752
Hey, guys.

34
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,353
Guess what we're doing down
at the Larry Storch School of Acting?

35
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,312
Merging with
the Slappy White School of Acting?

36
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,273
Oh, Bud, you're home.

37
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,552
I didn't see your Big Wheels
parked out in the driveway.

38
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,035
Anyway, Larry gave us
this great assignment.

39
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,593
I get to make a movie.

40
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,355
Do the words, "Does Dallas,"
appear anywhere in the title?

41
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,955
Aren't you late for your nightly lurk
around the newsstand or something?

42
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,000
Anyway, Larry says that it's as good
to be behind as well as in front...

43
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,676
...of the camera.

44
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,394
But I can't start my movie
until I have an idea.

45
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,716
Hey, Daddy, do you know anything?

46
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,034
<i>I know that Luke Ventura
is in Shoe News and I'm not.</i>

47
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,637
I should be there and he should
be here being your daddy.

48
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,873
There's no shot of that,
is there, Mom?

49
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,830
Come on, Dad,
you have to know something else.

50
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,349
Pumpkin, I don't have time
to know anything else.

51
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,235
It's a full time job just keeping
the tears in my head.

52
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,270
Now we're a two-job,
no-income family.

53
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,630
I gotta find an idea for my movie.

54
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,068
Movie.

55
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,316
<i>That's it.
That will get me into Shoe News.</i>

56
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,637
A movie about shoes.

57
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,720
If only I had an idea.

58
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,154
If only I had a camera.

59
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,074
If only I had a hammer.

60
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,510
So Al and Kelly actually
made a movie about shoes?

61
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,872
Yeah, but they prefer to call it
a shoe-cumentary.

62
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,758
I'm kind of worried
about Kelly, though.

63
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,032
How is she gonna get to the next
level at the Larry Storch School...

64
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,958
...if she doesn't pass
this assignment?

65
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,948
The Larry Storch School
has a next level?

66
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,994
Yeah, next year
is acting from the waist up.

67
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,192
Great news, Peg.
We just edited our film.

68
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,632
We cut it from eight hours
to a clean three-and-a-half minutes.

69
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,514
Well, seven of those hours we didn't
know the camera was on, so...

70
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,672
Al, may I speak with you in private?

71
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,359
Is this about your rose bushes?

72
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,552
- If it is, I heard a dog barking out there.
- Not that.

73
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,158
How could you use your own daughter
to make a stupid movie about shoes?

74
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,315
Excuse me, Mrs. D'Arcy,
but our shoe movie is not stupid.

75
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,748
It is genius.

76
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,270
We even entered it into
the Hammond Indiana Film Festival.

77
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,759
We're gonna be the biggest show biz
family since Betty and Barry White.

78
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,354
Wait a minute,
that film festival is sponsored by...

79
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,596
...the National Endowment
for the Arts.

80
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,792
They're offering $10,000
to the best film...

81
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,434
...which will be ours.

82
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,634
Al, those grants were intended
for starving and destitute artists.

83
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,831
Well, we are starving.

84
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,115
I'm not a destitute.
I've never taken money for--

85
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,555
Guard the film, pumpkin.

86
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,157
Look, Al, I'll grant you the NEA has
done some silly things in the past...

87
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,230
...but no way, no how, will they accept
a ridiculous movie about shoes.

88
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,671
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

89
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,476
<i>...the world premiere of Shoes.</i>

90
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,953
<i>Shoes is a taut and gripping film
in the Warhol tradition.</i>

91
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,077
Oh, please.

92
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,353
Will the gentleman in the third row
please sit down and stop heckling.

93
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,113
Now you've done it. Now you've gone
and ticked off my husband.

94
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,554
Shut up.

95
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,509
<i>Millions of years ago,
man emerged from the ocean...</i>

96
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,838
<i>...and took his first steps
on dry land.</i>

97
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,390
<i>This of course was to
escape from women...</i>

98
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,160
<i>...and other blood-sucking
sea creatures.</i>

99
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,350
<i>Sheos.</i>

100
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,959
<i>Shoes.</i>

101
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,359
Remember?
E before O except before E-I-E-I-O.

102
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,232
This is beyond redemption.

103
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,230
Peg, is that a yellow M&M
down there on the floor?

104
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,833
Well, I don't see an M&M, Al.

105
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,114
<i>The cave people had to put
something on their feet.</i>

106
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,959
<i>They tried many things.</i>

107
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,038
<i>Tried many things.</i>

108
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,475
<i>Tried many things.</i>

109
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,271
<i>Many things.</i>

110
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,557
Those are my dummies.

111
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,273
Oh, please.

112
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,399
<i>And then one day, legend has it,
the great shoe man in the sky...</i>

113
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,720
<i>...who once scored four touchdowns
in a single game, intervened.</i>

114
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,033
When this is over,
try to stay at least 10 feet from Al...

115
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,959
...that way you won't get hit
by the first burst.

116
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,558
<i>Some claim there was no great
shoe man in the sky.</i>

117
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,436
<i>Others say the answer won't be known
until the other shoe drops.</i>

118
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,279
<i>Rosebud.</i>

119
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,192
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

120
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,550
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

121
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,792
Bravo.

122
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,793
<i>They won?
Sheos, the movie, actually won?</i>

123
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,710
Yup. First place.

124
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:18,074
The NEA actually gave Al and Kelly
a cheque for $10,000.

125
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,353
This is an outrage.

126
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,233
That money could have gone
for something much more useful...

127
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,795
...like jailing the homeless.

128
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,516
Well, it's not like it's theirs to waste.

129
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,314
They have to use the money they won
to make another movie.

130
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,278
Another one?

131
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,553
Yeah. But, of course, Al didn't realize
that until he'd spent a $1000 on beer.

132
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,356
Thanks for signing my inner thigh,
Mr. Bundy.

133
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,228
Now, now, Babette...

134
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,877
<i>...we promised not to speak of
such things in front of Les Miserables.</i>

135
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,800
So the NEA actually
gave you $10,000.

136
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,390
They did.

137
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,717
- This is exactly why I'm a Republican.
- Oh, really?

138
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,476
I thought it was because of the drinking
and wife-swapping parties.

139
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,756
That's never been proven.

140
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,198
<i>Al, I thought you did this
to get into Shoe News.</i>

141
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,113
Oh, no, Peg.

142
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,959
<i>No, this is much bigger
than Shoe News.</i>

143
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,119
Well, see, Peg, all my life, I've always
wanted to find something that--

144
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,356
That I was good at.

145
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,918
And the other night in that theater...

146
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,914
...when I heard the applause,
felt the love...

147
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,874
...I knew then what my true calling
would be.

148
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,997
Zoo exhibit?

149
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,110
Cheap and tawdry film.

150
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,237
And if all goes according to plan,
I'll be leaving for Hollywood.

151
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,876
Where when a guy has
a successful film, he leaves the wife.

152
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,988
Hey, Daddy,
I have these storyboards ready.

153
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,514
Good work, pumpkin.

154
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,190
All right, now as you recall,
the name of our new movie...

155
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,675
<i>...is A Day in the Life
of a Shoe Salesman.</i>

156
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,832
Yes, but aren't you gonna start
with the short cartoon...

157
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,510
<i>...A Day in the Sex Life
of a Shoe Salesman?</i>

158
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,793
Oh, I'm really gonna miss you, Peg.

159
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,795
Well, not if I buy a scope.

160
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,837
- Go ahead, pumpkin.
- All right.

161
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,511
Now these stick figures represent what
you go through in the course of a day.

162
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,990
That's good, pumpkin,
but, you know, it just doesn't say Al.

163
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,711
If you shorten that stick there,
it will.

164
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,672
You know, Peg, have I told you today
how much I love you?

165
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,798
- No, Al.
- Okay.

166
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,754
See, pumpkin, what I was saying,
it needs something.

167
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,236
It's too linear and too straight.

168
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,479
Needs bigness. Roundness.

169
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,674
Fullness.

170
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,077
Firmness.

171
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,512
Oh, God, I could die right now.

172
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,909
You would if Mom was here.

173
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,315
Why do we have to be in bikinis,
Mr. Bundy?

174
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,276
My dear, I'm not going to lie to you.

175
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,068
The integrity of the scene
calls for it.

176
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,792
Okay.

177
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,198
That and the crew really loves it.

178
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,913
Daddy? Yeah.

179
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,714
I just finished looking over
your rewrite of the script.

180
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,876
Now granted I'm not here every day...

181
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,674
...but how often do four women
in bikinis...

182
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,440
...just kind of wander on in
to buy shoes?

183
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,070
About as often as the guy
with an IQ of 16...

184
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,589
...gets to meet
a bunch of presidents.

185
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,788
What's your problem?

186
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,354
<i>Daddy, the point is,
is that when we did Sheos...</i>

187
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,677
...we were being true
to our subject and to ourselves.

188
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,030
Now this is not art.

189
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,310
I may not know art,
but I know what I like.

190
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,510
Sorry, ma'am, but we're closed.

191
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,472
Well, how come
they're buying shoes?

192
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,951
Why, look at them.

193
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,710
I see. So if I come back wearing
a bikini, you'll sell me some shoes?

194
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,390
Ma'am, if you get into a bikini,
I'll give you some shoes.

195
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,077
Deal.

196
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,269
Bye-bye.

197
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,829
Al, we gotta hurry.

198
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,714
All right now, girls,
here is the scene.

199
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,434
You're in the shoe store...

200
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,190
...you're laying down.

201
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,919
Why are we laying down?

202
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,998
Well, you're tired.

203
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,952
You've been shopping all day.

204
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,031
That makes perfect sense.

205
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,320
Daddy, what does this have to do
with selling shoes?

206
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,829
Everything. Now go away.

207
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,950
Yo, Bob Rooney here.

208
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,390
Hi, it's me, Ike.

209
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,751
- Hey, Ike. What's up?
- Nothing much.

210
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,430
Hey, listen, I thought of a catch phrase
for the movie poster:

211
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,313
<i>Hasta la vista, shoe man.</i>

212
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,590
Loving it. Loving it.

213
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,109
I'll run it past the big guy.

214
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,392
Excuse me.

215
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,879
- Hello?
- Al.

216
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,354
Ike just called with an idea.

217
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,950
I know, he's right here,
you scrub brush.

218
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,516
What was I thinking of
when I bought you guys phones?

219
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,553
Hey, I didn't get a phone.

220
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,398
All I got was this beeper.

221
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,836
"Call Griff."

222
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,275
- Hey, Al, can I use your phone?
- No!

223
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,835
- I got a--
- No, no, no, no!

224
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,190
Guys, focus, focus!

225
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,278
Places, everyone, places!

226
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,029
<i>A Day in the Life--</i>

227
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,073
<i>A Day in the Life
of a Shoe Salesman, take one.</i>

228
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,797
And action.

229
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,797
Cut!

230
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,833
See, Alderman Kuczxynski.

231
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,395
This is exactly where
our tax money is going...

232
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,519
...to finance stupid films like this
made by idiotic filmmakers like him...

233
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,995
...and Steven Seagal.

234
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,790
Hi, sugar cakes. Remember me?

235
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,278
Sugar cakes is my given name.

236
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,552
Well, aren't you going to stop this?

237
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,193
No, he is not, Marcie.

238
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,870
You see, the NEA gave me money
for me to make a movie of my life.

239
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,957
If you want to see
a movie of your life...

240
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,596
<i>...I suggest you go rent
Rooster Cogburn.</i>

241
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,271
Where did you learn
to light a breast?

242
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,430
That's it. I'm calling Washington.

243
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,319
Bite me.

244
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,548
All right, places, everyone.

245
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,593
Places, please. Places.

<i>A Day in the Life of a Shoe Salesman,
take two.</i>

247
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,110
And action.

248
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,117
I'd like to buy some shoes
and then make love to you.

249
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,514
Fine, but first...

250
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,110
...I must make love
to these three here.

251
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,750
- Hold the phone.
- What is it now?

252
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,918
Daddy, we're selling out.

253
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,991
Now as co-bigwig
on this production...

254
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,158
...I cannot allow this abuse of power
to go on any longer.

255
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,518
- I'm all set, Mr. Bundy.
- Take your place.

256
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,153
Who's that?

257
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,749
He's playing the mall terrorist.

258
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,631
And action.

259
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,029
<i>In local news...</i>

260
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,314
<i>...an 84 car pile-up was caused by
a blind man or his German shepherd...</i>

261
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,195
<i>...one of whom was apparently
driving an ambulance.</i>

262
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,509
<i>Again, no charges were filed
as both had valid driver's licenses.</i>

Hey, family.

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,038
Jefferson.

265

Rhode Island Red.

266
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,159
Do we know yet how much the NEA
loved my movie?

267
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,628
Not yet, Al.

268
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,111
Funny, I sent it in over a month ago,
I wonder what could have happened.

269
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,353
Yeah. They wouldn't treat
Francis Ford Coppertop like that.

270
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,672
Yeah. You know, they're probably
passing it around Washington...

271
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,952
...and Clarence Thomas got ahold of it
and won't give it up.

272
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,272
They burned it, you cretin.

273
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,950
They put on their golf shoes
and jumped up and down on it.

274
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,237
Oh, Al, you know how slowly
the government works.

275
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,592
Remember last year? I didn't get
Marcie's tax refund cheque until June.

276
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,994
I thought you said I owed.

277
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,828
Why does it always
have to be about you?

278
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,948
Look, Daddy, don't worry.

279
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,913
Speaking as a student
of the Larry Storch School of Acting...

280
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,873
...I can guarantee you
that the NEA is gonna love it.

281

00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,832
Yup.

286
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,233
Then why are you smiling?

287
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,476
Why, Peg?

288
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,194
Because it doesn't
matter anymore, see?

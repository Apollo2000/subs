00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,193
This is a man's world

3
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,879
This is a man's world

4
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,593
Baby!

5
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,752
-But it wouldn't mean nothing
-But it wouldn't mean nothing

6
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,393
Nothing

7
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,989
Without a woman or a girl

8
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,076
Well, tonight, my NO MA'AM brothers...

9
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,392
...while our wives are flirting
their lives away at bingo...

10
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,756
...we will be watching
the sport of kings:

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,195
-Wrestling.
-Yes.

12
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,999
Have we got the necessary snacks
from the Just Store?

13
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,516
-Yeah. l got Just Oreo filling.
-l've got Just jerky.

14
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,832
And l've got Just alcohol.

15
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,278
Okay, guys, let's party like Kennedys.

16
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,509
Yes!

17
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,114
This is a man's wo--

18
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,189
Well, Peg, like l said
when l woke up this morning:

19
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,868
What the hell are you doing here?

20
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,431
We skipped bingo tonight to watch
the TV movie Old Man Older Woman.

21
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,429
They made a movie of our love life?

22
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,834
No. That would be
Young Redhead Younger Pizza Boy.

23
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,636
Old Man Older Woman
is the TV movie event of the season.

24
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,474
lt's an epic love story
spanning three generations...

25
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,678
...ages 7 0 through 1 00.

26
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,589
Starring Hume Cronyn,
Katharine Hepburn...

27
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,991
...and introducing Buddy Ebsen
as Junior.

28
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,154
-CBS?
-Of course.

29
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,988
Well, Marcie, l'm afraid
that you and the Joy Cluck Club...

30
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,789
...are going to have to miss
slipping denture theatre tonight...

31
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,270
...because me and the guys
are watching wrestling.

32
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,553
-Yeah.
-You'll watch it over my dead body.

33
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,279
Okay.

34
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,513
All right. All right.
Come on, guys.

35
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,035
Let's go back to my place.
We don't have to stay...

36
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,879
-...and take guff from the women.
-Hold it, mister.

37
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,159
You know the rules:
''Only one friend over at a time.''

38
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,273
But l did all my chores.

39
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,158
There must be somewhere
we can proudly watch wrestling.

40
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,119
How about your grown son's room
down in the basement?

41
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,873
Griff, you're a genius.

42
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,953
We'll watch it on Bud's TV.

43
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,558
'' Please do not disturb.
l'm getting some.''

44
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,277
The door is locked.

45
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,397
You really think
he's got a girl in there?

46
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,670
Five bucks says he doesn't.

47
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,750
Bud, l'm not like other girls.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,228
l understand.

49
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,552
l only go all the way on the first date.

50
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,951
l'll be a son of a gun.
He does have a girl down here.

51
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,359
Excuse me. Excuse me.
l got a girl here.

52
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,513
l know. You just cost me 5 bucks.
Damn you.

53
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,951
Don't mind us.
We just gonna be watching wrestling.

54
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,710
-Just Cheetos' dust?
-Just stick it.

55
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,470
Thanks, Dad. Thanks.

56
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,589
That was Nasty Natalie.

57
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,391
She's the easiest girl in town.

58
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,471
Bud, if my father scared away
the easiest girl in my town...

59
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,989
...l'd never have gotten married,
nor had you kids.

60
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,236
l'd be upstairs watching TV
in my underwear...

61
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,873
...the way God had intended.

62
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,958
What's wrong with the TV?

63
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,430
You gotta stand behind it
with a clothes hanger...

64
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,914
...for the picture to clear.

65
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,998
Oh, hey. They're about to interview
King Kong Bundy.

66
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,198
Hey, Al, are you any relation
to King Kong Bundy?

67
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,238
No. But he did take Peg's nickname.

68
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,638
Check out King Kong's
''curvaliscious'' valet...

69
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,757
...Anytime.

70
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,873
Listen up, wrestling fans.

71
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,394
I'm King Kong Bundy.

72
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,838
And tomorrow, Halloween night,
live from Chicago's ''Dick-a-dome''...

73
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,116
...I'm going to tak e
that Captain Ecology...

74
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,073
...and tear him a new ozone hole.

75
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,548
Isn't that right, Anytime?

76
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,999
Oh, if you say so it must be so,
King Kong-o.

77
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,191
She's brilliant.

78
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,719
Remember, that's tomorrow night.

79
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,396
Right after
the Mik e Tyson, Macaulay Culkin fight.

80
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,390
King Kong Bundy is the greatest.

81
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,868
He's my idol.

82
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,031
Well, him and Yanni.

83
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,954
Hey, l think we should make
King Kong Bundy...

84
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,634
-...an honorary member of NO MA'AM.
-Good idea.

85
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,836
-That's a good idea.
-Wait a second.

86
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,435
l've been trying to get in
for six months now.

87
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,636
Why is King Kong Bundy
gonna get in over me?

88
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,273
Well, let's see.

89
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,636
King Kong is a man's man...

90
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,075
...and you're a human antenna.

91
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,159
Yeah, and you suck at it.

92
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,193
Wait a minute now, guys.

93
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,078
That's my son we're talking about.

94
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,073
The only one who gets
to make fun of him is me.

95
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,157
And most women.

96
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,675
Hey, if he wants to join NO MA'AM...

97
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,390
...l say let's let him pledge
our proud organization.

98
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,438
So, what do you have to do?
Chug beers until l puke?

99
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,556
No, son. That's reserved
for full members.

100
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,432
As a NO MA'AM pledge...

101
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,830
...you must perform
a challenging labour...

102
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,513
...to show you are one of us.

103
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,149
Something brave and heroic
to benefit mankind?

104
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,791
No. Something really, really stupid
that benefits no one.

105
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,036
Congratulations, son,
you're an official NO MA'AM plebe.

106
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,875
Now, tomorrow night,
you go down to Wrestle Palooza.

107
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,792
lf you can get your picture taken...

108
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,679
...with King Kong Bundy,
our idol, you're in.

109
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,239
Son...

110
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,357
...make me proud.

111
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,397
-What if l can't get the picture?
-Well, then you can still be...

112
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,353
...the official NO MA'AM bottle opener.

113
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,789
Okay. Come here.

114
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,395
Bud, the girls on the bus
were laughing with you, not at you.

115
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,028
Kelly, l asked you to rent me a costume
so l could pass as a wrestler...

116
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,352
...not one of
the Chuck E. Cheese players.

117
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,553
Bud, it's Halloween.

118
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,951
lt was either this or Pocahontas.

119
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,272
Frankly, l don't think you
have the cleavage for it.

120
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,113
-Hi.
-Hey.

121
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,998
Oh, let me guess.

122
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,514
Beauty...

123
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,637
...and the flea, right?

124
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,638
That's close, work release.

125
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,909
Listen.

126
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,037
l'm a wrestler known as...

127
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,032
...the Bumble Bee.

128
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,192
l don't see no insects
on tonight's card.

129
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,311
Well, that's because--

130
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,357
You see, l'm a backup wrestler.

131
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,275
So in case any of the regular wrestlers
can't perform their duties, then l--

132
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,476
He duties for them.

133
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,753
Kelly, that's him.

134
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,349
l need to get a picture with him
to get into NO MA'AM.

135
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,717
-Yo, Kong, how they clanging, man?
-l'm mad.

136
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,191
l'm madder than ma--
l'm freaking bananas.

137
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,513
Captain Ecology just backed out
of our match.

138
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,954
That sissy mary said:

139
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,352
'' lt's cloudy
and my solar car won't start.''

140
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,119
Excuse me, sir.

141
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,557
l was wondering if l could get
a picture with you?

142
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,277
lt would mean a lot
to my brain-dead father.

143
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,710
Sure, kid. l do a lot of work
on behalf of the stupid.

144
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,513
Just say, Cheez Doodles.

145
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,910
Cheez Doodle--

146
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,515
Wait a minute. l have an idea.

147
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,639
Now, since my brother here
is the backup wrestler...

148
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,395
...he could take the place
of Captain Proctology.

149
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,553
You know? She's right.

150
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,951
You can fight the Bumble Bee.

151
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,839
Everyone would be happy.

152
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,232
Everyone?

153
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,032
This is a man's world

154
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,552
This is a man's world

155
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,389
But it wouldn't mean nothing

156
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,158
Nothing

157
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,035
Without a woman or a girl

158
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,795
Men, tonight, while our wives are out
trick-or-treating...

159
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,510
...dressed as large, ugly women
and a chicken...

160
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,317
...we will be watching in colour,
on a full size TV...

161
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,120
...Wrestle Palooza.

162
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,148
Have we got our manly snacks
for tonight?

163
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,837
Well, all we have left are the pretzels
Bob Rooney sucked all the salt off of.

164
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,918
Come on. Hey, hey.

165
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,071
What are we going to eat tonight, then?

166
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,153
Trick or treat.

167
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,548
By God, for you kids had
a pretty darn good night, didn't you?

168
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,470
Don't we look scary?

169
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,150
No. This is scary.

170
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,349
l love Halloween.

171
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,751
You should. Your head is shaped
like a pumpkin.

172
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,399
Focus. Focus.
Gentlemen, focus.

173
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,868
Now.

174
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,638
Let us chew...

175
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,795
...and view.

176
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,270
This is a man's world

177
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,714
Well, we must have gone back in time
because l'm experiencing dejא moo.

178
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,195
We are watching the rebroadcast
of Old Man Older Woman.

179
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,309
So much of CBS' audience fell asleep,
they're showing it again.

180
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,556
Only this time they are airing it
earlier and louder.

181
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,109
Forget it. We're watching wrestling.

182
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,392
We went through too much trouble
to get snacks to let them waste.

183
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,672
Listen...

184
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,436
...jerk-o'-lantern.

185
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,356
Wrestling appeals to the dregs
of American society.

186
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,515
We women, however, appreciate
meaningful, uplifting entertainment.

187
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,310
Oh, my God, look at that wrestler.

188
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,472
l'd love to pin him to the mat.

189
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,358
Now, that is a real man.

190
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,993
Not some high school football hero
who got married and turned to mush.

191
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,830
Well, l guess it's true what they say,
you are what you marry.

192
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,315
That would make me a hoe.

193
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,557
Silence. Silence.

194
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,075
The king is entering the ring.

195
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,311
Oh, there's just something so sexy...

196
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,870
...about a big, oily man
in a sparkly cape.

197
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,510
My lke felt that way
about Elvis before he died.

198
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,913
He's alive l tell you.

199
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,556
-Alive, l say!
-Take it easy, lke.

200
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,399
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

201
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,756
I'm Jimmy Lennon Jr. and welcome...

202
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,515
... to the special Halloween edition
of Wrestle Palooza...

203
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,833
... where tonight's wrestlers
have costumes under their costumes.

204
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,119
Next main event features
the most feared man on Earth.

205
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,354
Introducing King Kong Bundy.

206
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,679
And tonight's challenger
hailing from parts unknown...

207
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,674
...the Bumble Bee.

208
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,518
And here are their gorgeous valets...

209
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,276
...Anytime and Honey.

210
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,480
-No, it's mine.
-l saw it first.

211
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,237
You boys understand the rules, right?

212
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,917
Yeah. l just--

213
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,191
l just have one thing to say.

214
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,714
Please don't kill me, man.

215
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,838
Please, please.

216
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,834
Don't worry, kid, you help me out.
l'll go easy on you.

217
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,754
lt's amazing. lt's astounding.

218
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,549
Look at the heinie on that Honey.

219
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,232
Oh, in the ring
King Kong Bundy is down.

220
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,869
One, two--

221
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,277
That's what l get for trying
to take it easy on you.

222
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,956
l expect that kind of chicanery
from the Fighting Florist.

223
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,713
But l assumed from your valet...

224
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,952
...you're the kind of guy
that liked girls.

225
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,909
-l do.
-Then prepare to become one.

226
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,829
Oh, God!

227
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,673
Wow, this is cool.

228
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,477
King Kong is twisting off
the Bumble Bee's stinger.

229
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,030
That's not his stinger.

230
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,233
Oh, girls, it's 7:00.

231
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,040
lt's time to switch
to Old Man Older Woman.

232
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,478
Are you insane?
And miss a televised '' Bobbitizing''?

233
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,070
Peg, you want to grab
my whatchamacallit?

234
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,879
Al, there's a lot of people around.

235
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,955
Okay.

236
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,230
No.

237
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,192
l meant this whatchamacallit,
you cherry Blow Pop.

238
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,556
Looks like the Bumble Bee
is making his move.

239
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,230
Kelly. Help Me. Kelly.

240
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,914
You're a bee, fly.

241
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,598
That's it, Bud.

242
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,789
Mom.

243
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,470
Oh, this is so much fun.

244
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,393
l think the Bumble Bee is dead.

245
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,709
Oh, Bob Rooney, you know
what all this grunting and sweating...

246
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,316
...and screaming reminds me of?

247
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,673
Thanksgiving dinner at your mother's?

248
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,078
l was thinking of what we do
after dinner...

249
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,676
...you big turkey baster, you.

250
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,959
Jefferson...

251
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,988
...do you know what these sweaty men
in tight spandex remind me of?

252
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,953
Thanksgiving dinner at your father's?

253
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,356
Well, yes.

254
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,871
But also--

255
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,798
Oh, lke...

256
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,749
...can little Elvis come out and play?

257
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,913
You know, Al...

258
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,718
...watching all this wrestling...

259
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,714
...reminds me of something
l haven't had in a long time.

260
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,758
What? Body slam?

261
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,116
Call it what you'd like.

262
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,831
I know I'm standing, yet I feel
lik e I'm in a warm bath.

263
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,634
Hey. Listen, Bud.

264
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,398
Try and get closer to King Kong...

265
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,636
...so l can get you both in the picture.
Okay?

266
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,157
-Okay.
-Okay.

267
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,072
Where did he go?

268
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,275
Bye-bye.

269
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,155
-One, two, three--
-Five.

270
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,516
--four, five.

271
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,996
And the winner of the match...

272
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,789
...King Kong Bundy.

273
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,398
Okay, smile.

274
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,632
Come on, my little Bumble Bee,
show me some teeth.

275
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,273
Good.

276
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,193
Dad?

277
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,957
Oh, good, you're out of the coma.

278
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,753
Where am l?

279
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,753
ls she gone? ls it over?

280
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,639
Yes, Dad.

281
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,110
Now save your strength.

282
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,873
The important thing is...

283
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,237
...l got my picture
with King Kong Bundy.

284
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,837
So now l'm in NO MA'AM, right?

285
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,709
No, son. We don't watch
wrestling anymore.

286
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,033
See, we learned tonight...

287
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,750
...that wrestling on TV leads
to wrestling at home.

288
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,230
And that ultimately leads
to sex with the wife.

289
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,789
So now NO MA'AM stands for...

290
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,079
...Numb Old
Men Anxiously Awaiting Morticians.

291
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,838
So all this was a waste of time?

292
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,991
Well for you, maybe.

293
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,073
This was the best meal
l've had at home in years.

294
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,716
This is a T-bone, mashed-potato drip
going in this arm, baby.

295
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,117
That's eating.

296
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,673
Hey, son...

297
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,275
...are you gonna finish yours?

298
00:22:00,305 --> 00:23:00,815

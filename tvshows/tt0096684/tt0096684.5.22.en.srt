1
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:34,289
What do you got on tap?

2
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,733
Schlitz.
Schlitz.

3
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,737
Schlitz?

4
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:41,569
Got Iron City, Duquesne
or Fort Pitt in bottles.

5
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,575
Yeah, Schlitz will be fine.

6
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:47,204
Regular... or schooner?

7
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,043
Schooner.

8
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:59,284
What do I owe you?
Fifteen cents.

9
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,350
Fifteen cents.

10
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,555
There you go.

11
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:32,457
Oh, boy.

12
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,529
Something wrong?

13
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,971
That's, uh, me...

14
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,179
in the m-mirror.

15
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,084
My God!

16
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,085
- What?
- I've got white hair.

17
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:10,850
<i>Just a little. You know, you really
should look in the mirror more often.</i>

18
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,858
Look at these crow's feet!

19
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:16,555
<i>When's the last time you took
a really good look at yourself?</i>

20
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,256
It's been a while.

21
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:21,232
Well, you let too much time go by,

22
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,031
you could lose touch with reality.

23
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:25,968
<i>I shouldn't talk.</i>

24
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,772
I look in this mirror every day for years
and still thought of myself as a skinny kid.

25
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:33,175
Took this picture
to wake me up.

26
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,611
<i>- You pushed your stomach out to make yourselflook fat.
- No, I didn't.</i>

27
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,452
Yeah!

28
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:49,552
That's-

29
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,557
So those are all
- These are all pictures from World War II, huh?

30
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,865
Everybody from Cokeburg
who served is up there.

31
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:01,395
Who's in the picture with you?
Oh, that's my brother, Joe.

32
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:05,911
We took this when I went down to visit him at
Camp Edwards just before he shipped out for Europe.

33
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,607
He's a teacher now.
Oh, that's great.

34
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:13,084
Well, you don't look like you
changed much. Hair's gone gray.

35
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:18,317
Well, that's not too bad
considering it's been-What?

36
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:23,328
A few years, at least,
you know, since-

37
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,789
Do you, by any chance,
have today's paper?

38
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:30,495
<i>No. I already tossed
the Post Gazette.</i>

39
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,561
<i>Press gets here at 6:00.</i>

40
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,934
Wait. I may have saved
the sports page.

41
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,944
The Pirates lost.
Yeah?

42
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,845
<i>Again.</i>

43
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:45,816
Never should have traded Kiner
to the Cubs. No, I guess not.

44
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:52,020
August 8, 1953.

45
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,463
- It's the day I was born.
- Happy birthday.

46
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,158
<i>I was born at 12:30 in Indiana,</i>

47
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,501
so that means, uh,

48
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,506
43 minutes from now.

49
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,906
No. Actually, it's 17 minutes ago.

50
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,310
Time is a little funny here. The town
voted not to go on daylight savings time.

51
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,281
So 12:30 here is the same
as 12:30 in the Midwest.

52
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:22,714
Well, then I was born roughly the
same time I came through that door.

53
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,778
Holy smokes!

54
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,784
Wow!

55
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,683
I guess I should've warned you.

56
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,450
<i>Gooshie has the worst
breath in Cokeburg. Gooshie?</i>

57
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,585
That guy's name is Gooshie?

58
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,925
I'll be right back.

59
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,139
<i>Lookit here.
That's really funny.</i>

60
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,144
<i>No.</i>

61
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:26,007
<i>What's his problem?</i>

62
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,501
You called that guy Gooshie?
Mm-hmm.

63
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:55,112
- And your name is Al?
- Albert.

64
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,775
It's not... Calavicci, is it?

65
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,943
No. Not Calavicci.

66
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,613
<i>It's funny, because I happen
to know a Gooshie,</i>

67
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:06,647
<i>and you gotta admit that Gooshie isn't
really, like, a-a common household name.</i>

68
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:10,162
And I also happen to know an Al.

69
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,857
- Al's pretty common.
- Yeah. But not Gooshie.

70
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:17,665
<i>And, uh- well, the weird thing is that
the Gooshie that I know and-and that Gooshie-</i>

71
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:20,331
<i>they got the same horrible breath.</i>

72
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,874
Halitosis isn't rare,
especially with the old-timers.

73
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,809
Yeah. Well, maybe not.

74
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:28,312
But there are two boys out front there...

75
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:31,009
that look kind of familiar to me too.

76
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,347
Well, don't all boys look
a little bit alike?

77
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,650
I don't know. There's something
pretty coincidental about the whole thing.

78
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:40,453
Especially, you know,
with me being me and all.

79
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,056
Does that sound a little strange?

80
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,623
Ah, just a little.

81
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,700
<i>His name's Stawpah.</i>

82
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,502
Anyone named Stawpah
in your life?

83
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,509
Not that I can remember.

84
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,670
You no miner.

85
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,974
Uh, no.

86
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:08,680
No, I'm not. I'm just passing
through. My name is Sam.

87
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,419
I was miner.

88
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,427
Best damn loader in Marianna.

89
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,898
<i>I load 24 ton a shift.</i>

90
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,900
Twenty-four.

91
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:27,201
Today 16 ton- big deal.
Hmm.

92
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:31,733
Sixteen.
My bubba could load 16 ton.

93
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,438
Bubba?

94
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,504
Grandmother.
Oh.

95
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,742
You think I lie?

96
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,285
Easy, Stawp.
Let him enjoy his beer.

97
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,380
I know.

98
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:48,359
You think, how could cripple
load 24 ton of coal?

99
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:52,328
I no always like this.

100
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,730
I was big.

101
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,531
- Strong like bull.
- I'm sure you were.

102
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:02,335
Loading coal in water
did this to me.

103
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:05,036
Soak my bones.

104
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,807
Rust them.

105
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,145
I lucky live to see 50.

106
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,685
I thought it was 40.

107
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:16,221
I was 40 in March.

108
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:25,319
Al, you better give me a double
shot of whiskey and a can of snuff.

109
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:35,167
You're not retarded.
You're just slow. Okay?

110
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,142
Frank!

111
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,735
Hey, how you doin', man?
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

112
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,747
How are ya?
Who the hell are you?

113
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:46,307
Frank, it's me, Jim-
I don't know you, Jim.

114
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:49,821
<i>He tell me his name's Sam.
Which is it?</i>

115
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,925
It's Sam.
Sam.

116
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,827
Sam Beckett. But your name is
Frank, right? My name's Tonchi.

117
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:02,057
Do-Do you have
a younger brother?

118
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,371
What about him?

119
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,172
Was he born with Down
syndrome? What the hell is that?

120
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:14,178
A genetic disease that causes
mental retardation.

121
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:17,841
You saying my brother was born stupid?
No, no, no. I would never say that!

122
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,681
I was just asking if he was born
with a mental disability.

123
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,618
That mean born stupid.

124
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:26,454
<i>Pete may be a little bit slow,
but he ain't stupid!</i>

125
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:32,860
I gotta go to work. But don't
talk about my brother. All right?

126
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,366
Even usin' fancy words,
don't talk about him.

127
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,533
Al, put this on my tab, will ya?

128
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,540
How you know he not
State Liquor Control Board?

129
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:45,941
What? It's illegal to run
a bar tab in Pennsylvania.

130
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:50,073
- If you were Liquor Control Board, I could lose my license.
- Check his wallet!

131
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,710
Why don't I, uh,
show it to you, huh?

132
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,412
What that?

133
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,392
Just Velcro.

134
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,724
It's a new kind of zipper.

135
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,170
You know,

136
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,672
who I am is really none
of your business.

137
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,833
<i>Take it, Tonchi.!</i>

138
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,843
I think you better
give me that wallet.

139
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,903
<i>You're gonna be late for work, Tonch.
Can't have that.</i>

140
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:49,732
<i>There's no one here.!
Gooshie, this is impossible.</i>

141
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,800
If there's no one here,

142
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,142
that means he had to leap
into himself.

143
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,978
Well, Ziggy gives that
a 99.2% probability.

144
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,547
He's somewhere in time
as himself?

145
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,953
Apparently so.

146
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,788
<i>Well, how in the hell
is Ziggy gonna find him?</i>

147
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,454
We're not sure that she can.

148
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:30,443
You put 'em on, um,
Tonchi's tab, okay?

149
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,450
<i>It's full.</i>

150
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:35,544
<i>It was August the 8th, 1953-</i>

151
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,112
<i>literally the day I was born.</i>

152
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,715
<i>But instead of nursing
at my mother's breast,</i>

153
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:44,160
<i>I was nursing my third beer
in a vain attempt to make some sense...</i>

154
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,323
<i>out of this bizarre leap.</i>

155
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,457
<i>I'd leaped
into a coal-mining tavern,</i>

156
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,526
<i>people with names and faces
both strange and familiar to me.</i>

157
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:56,041
<i>But the biggest surprise
was that... I was me.</i>

158
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,339
<i>For the first time in years,
the reflection in the mirror was mine-</i>

159
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,436
<i>gray hair, crow's feet and all.</i>

160
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:06,417
<i>So why had I leaped here? What wrong was I
to put right? And where in God's name was Al?</i>

161
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:10,182
<i>I was so desperate for answers,
I was even looking for them on TV.</i>

162
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:13,851
<i>Captain Z-ro.!</i>

163
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:17,327
Research explorer
in time and space...

164
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,900
in a secret location known only
to a few in the outside world-

165
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:26,199
Hmm. Wouldn't it be great
to travel in time?

166
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:30,231
<i>Z- ro and his associates conduct
experiments in time and space.</i>

167
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,243
All right, time cadets!

168
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:36,509
Now, who has a question for
Captain Galaxy and Future Boy?

169
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,608
Captain Galaxy?

170
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,619
That's Captain Z-ro.

171
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:44,679
Is there a Captain Galaxy too?

172
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,486
Yes, there is.

173
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,618
Well, he must be
on channel 8.

174
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,753
Al don't get
channel 8 too good.

175
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:55,233
Only now and then, sometimes late at
night when the iodine bounces the signal.

176
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,099
lodine?
Yes.

177
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,502
<i>I read about this
in the Post Gazette.</i>

178
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:05,169
This iodine layer bounces
TV signals hundreds of miles.

179
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:09,374
lonosphere. The signal is
reflected by the ionosphere.

180
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,348
Yeah. That too.

181
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,545
- Your name isn't Moe Stein, is it?
- Nah, I'm Ziggy.

182
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,952
Oh, Zig-Ziggy?

183
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,621
Your name is Ziggy?
You heard of me?

184
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,597
I got a friend named Ziggy.

185
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:29,463
I never knew anyone named Ziggy.
What's he do?

186
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,194
She figures things out.

187
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,366
"She"? This Ziggy is a girl?

188
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,376
Sort of. Yeah.

189
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:41,470
Not much of a looker, huh?

190
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,209
I wouldn't let her
hear you say that.

191
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:47,946
You want me to straighten
your back for you, Stawpah?

192
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:53,718
He make fun of me because I no qualify
for machine gun in World War II.

193
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,589
I fail the written test.

194
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,664
You ever fire a machine gun?

195
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:04,959
I'm not sure.
Ah, you remember if you do.

196
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:09,269
There's nothing in the world
like shooting a water-cooled. 50.

197
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,673
You squeeze the trigger,

198
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,941
and she spits out
a stream of red tracers.

199
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,507
Empty cabbages fly everywhere.

200
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,986
- You mean cartridges?
- Them too.

201
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:26,786
<i>He not who he pretend to be, Al.</i>

202
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:30,317
Who's he pretending to be, Stawp?
I don't know.

203
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:34,696
When I figure that out,
then I know why he here.

204
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,032
Maybe he's here for the same reason you are
- to have a beer.

205
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:43,771
I never drink beer, Al.
You know that.

206
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,610
I forgot.

207
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,547
You no forget nothing.

208
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,416
I wonder what happen
around here if you did.

209
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,477
Things might go a little caca.

210
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,924
That you're, uh, part of
a time-travel experiment...

211
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,963
that went a little caca.

212
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,022
<i>Ah, don't let Stawpah
get your coat.</i>

213
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,965
<i>He don't trust nobody.</i>

214
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:13,698
He forgets he ain't in Russia
where everybody works for the B.V.D.

215
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,831
- K.G.B.
- Hmm.

216
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,899
Them too.
Them too.

217
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,180
Excuse me.

218
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,248
I know an Al who says "caca. "

219
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,886
Common expression.
Not where I come from.

220
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:41,724
You're not where you come from.
So this is just another coincidence?

221
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,930
"Caca's" a very common expression here since nearly
everyone in Cokeburg comes from the old country.

222
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,064
You know why I'm here, don't you?

223
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,370
Don't you watch
old Bogart movies?

224
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:54,276
First rule of good bartendering: Never
give away information for nothing.

225
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,372
Like to take a chance?

226
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:04,412
Cost you a nickel.
You might hit the jackpot.

227
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,981
- What's the jackpot?
- Ten bucks.

228
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:11,021
And the answer to your question.

229
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:13,121
- You mean that?
- Yes.

230
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:18,732
Here.

231
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:30,543
- So why am I here, Al?
- Did you hit the jackpot?

232
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:36,620
No.

233
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:40,715
Then I guess you'll just have to
figure that out for yourself, Sam.

234
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:46,060
<i>So how long is this nanosearch
going to take?</i>

235
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:48,292
A little over a month.
A month?

236
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:51,530
You expect me to stand in the
imaging chamber for a month?

237
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:55,471
Well, Ziggy estimates there's an 80%
chance we can acquire a neuron lock...

238
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,009
in as little as, uh,
two and a half weeks.

239
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,136
Give or take a day or two.

240
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,146
Gooshie.

241
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:17,654
- Ready, Gooshie?
- Affirmative, Admiral.

242
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,934
I know you're out there
somewhere, Sam.

243
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,497
Lock on to me, buddy!
Lock on.

244
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,811
Now Reds got H-bomb!

245
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,715
<i>So, they got the H-bomb! What
if they drop it on Pittsburgh?</i>

246
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,219
They won't.

247
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,983
<i>How you know? I'm a spy.
Spies know everything.</i>

248
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:49,460
Ha, ha. Very funny. Make big joke.

249
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,462
Don't worry, Stawpah.

250
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:56,160
- The Russkies drop bomb, we hide in mine till radiator blow away.
- Radiation.

251
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:59,295
<i>Oh, that too.</i>

252
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:03,740
"That too. " "That too. " You so
damn dumb, you no know your own name.

253
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,301
Simo. Simo Ziganovich.

254
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,644
<i>- Want me spell?
- Da.</i>

255
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:15,846
S- I-

256
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,421
- So Ziggy's just a nickname, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

257
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,490
He no can spell it.

258
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:33,368
Where'd you get a nickname like Ziggy?
A donkey threw him into a steam radiator.

259
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,273
What?

260
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:43,076
<i>We were playing donkey basketball at the
school gym to raise money for the town's widows.</i>

261
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:46,117
- Doesn't that tear up the gym floors?
- We wear tennis shoes.

262
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:52,616
After Ziggy got tossed into the steam
radiator, he zigged and zagged for a week.

263
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:57,559
And Al-Al-
He call me Ziggy ever since!

264
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,734
Does Al do all the nicknaming
around here?

265
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:05,361
<i>Yeah. He's good at it.</i>

266
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,371
I'll bet he is.

267
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:10,533
<i>He nicknamed Baba,
Ghee, Nuzo.</i>

268
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,874
M- Munja. Uh, Herky.
Uh, Kitty. Kitty.

269
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,540
- Jughead, Snaggs, Mutta.
- Ah!

270
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,708
Why you care what Al call us?

271
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:21,480
I need it for my B.V.D. Report.

272
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:27,151
What about Gooshie?
Did Al nickname Gooshie too?

273
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,751
Oh, he must have.
He-He nickname everybody.

274
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:32,388
<i>Al no nickname Gooshie.</i>

275
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:35,592
Gooshie been Gooshie
since day he was born.

276
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:39,330
Al only nickname dummy
like Ziggy.

277
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,238
I'm gettin' a little tired
of you calling him "dummy. "

278
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:47,142
- Why?
- How would you like it if people called you "cripple"?

279
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:49,510
I am cripple.

280
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,778
Wouldn't "physically disabled" be a more
humane way to describe your condition?

281
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,280
What you call it
no gonna change it.

282
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:59,256
<i>No, but it might change
people's attitudes toward you.</i>

283
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:03,260
That would only happen
if-if Stawpah shut his mouth!

284
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,493
<i>What's that?</i>

285
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,435
Trouble in mine!

286
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,981
Explosion in butt 18!
How bad?

287
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:33,491
Fire burned itself out, but we lost
about a hundred feet of tunnel.

288
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:37,050
Two men are trapped.
Who?

289
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,689
Tonchi and Pete.

290
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:52,473
The bottom's filling with gas. We'll have
to ventilate before anyone can go down.

291
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:55,513
- Why? We've got air tanks.
- Breathing isn't our only problem!

292
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,413
One spark, and the whole
damn mine'll blow! Ah!

293
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,646
- We'd be a year putting out the fire.
- What about Tonchi and Pete?

294
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,814
- They'll have to wait.
- What if they can't wait? What if they're hurt?

295
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,656
- Who are you?
- He's state safety inspector.

296
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,354
You're from
the Bureau of Mines then?

297
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,661
How long will it take
to ventilate the mine?

298
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:21,105
- Forty-eight hours.
- In 48 hours, they'll be dead!

299
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,334
- They're probably already dead!
- They're alive.

300
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:26,400
- How the hell do you know?
- I know.

301
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:31,346
- Any chance they are alive?
- There's always a chance, Mr. Collins.

302
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,441
<i>But they'd have
had to survive the blast,</i>

303
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,611
a hundred feet of tunnel caving in...

304
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,622
and wherever they're trapped,
have good air trapped with them.

305
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,250
Good air ain't gonna last no 48 hours, Kruger.

306
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:44,295
<i>Let us dig 'em out, Mr. Collins.
It's our lives we'll be risking.</i>

307
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,025
But I'm responsible for them.

308
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,397
- Isn't that so, Mr. -
- Beckett.

309
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:52,904
- I, for one, relieve you of your responsibility!
- Me for two!

310
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:58,273
- Who's goin' down with me?
- Nobody's going down that shaft till I say so!

311
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:00,607
I run this mine, Mutta, not you.

312
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,045
I'm not risking any more lives.

313
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:07,313
You no worry about lives.
You worry about mine catching fire.

314
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:11,345
You have a big mouth, Stawpah.
Always have.

315
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,983
Especially when it isn't
your neck on the line.

316
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,152
I risk my neck plenty.

317
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,822
Work in bottom since I 12.

318
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,331
How much you work bottom,
Mr. Collins?

319
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,766
This mine is closed!

320
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:27,896
- Lock the cage and put guards on the shaft.
- Yes, sir.

321
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:32,905
I assume you'll be
investigating this.

322
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:35,310
Feel free to use my office.

323
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,321
Huh.

324
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:51,860
Why did you tell him
I was the safety inspector?

325
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,922
Company men like Collins
make me cripple,

326
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,195
<i>so I make them sweat.</i>

327
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,635
Look, Stawpah,

328
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:01,899
you've got a lot to be bitter about,

329
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:05,739
but how is sweating Collins
gonna help Tonchi and Pete down there?

330
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,745
You right.

331
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:11,782
I need find way
get them out this time.

332
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,114
They cold, wet,

333
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,956
scared.

334
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:27,795
Pete real scared
'cause he no can see his brother.

335
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,125
What about their lamps?

336
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:34,138
Carbide lamp burn air,

337
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,197
so Tonchi put it out.

338
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,744
It black like coal down there.

339
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,747
But that not worst thing.

340
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,806
Worst thing is water.

341
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,784
Pump no work in bottom.

342
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,724
Water already up to Tonchi belt.

343
00:24:56,461 --> 00:25:01,091
We no get them out soon,
they no come out.

344
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,498
How do you know all this?

345
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,866
I been there...

346
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:08,929
too many time.

347
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:14,340
<i>I had thought Stawpah's pain
had turned him bitter and blind...</i>

348
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:16,573
<i>to anyone's plight but his own.</i>

349
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,809
<i>I was wrong.</i>

350
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:22,217
<i>He needed to save Tonchi
and Pete as much as I did.</i>

351
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,517
<i>Maybe more.</i>

352
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,580
<i>You're not here to save them.</i>

353
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,960
How'd you know
what I was thinking?

354
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:36,763
A good bartender has to be part
philosopher, part psychiatrist, part psychic.

355
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:41,538
Al.

356
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,433
I'd like to talk
to the philosopher part.

357
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:50,138
I just stick to the basics.

358
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,240
Okay. Okay.

359
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:55,980
"To be or not to be. " "I think,
therefore I am. " That kind of stuff?

360
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,818
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

361
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:03,391
- Why am I here?
- Why do you think you're here, Sam?

362
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:07,090
No, no, no. No. That's answering a question
with a question. That's psychiatrist stuff.

363
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,099
All right?

364
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,431
We're talking philosophy.

365
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:15,132
- That's good, Sam.
- Thank you. Now, why am I here?

366
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,674
You're beginning to think you're here
to save Pete and Tonchi.

367
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,403
- But I'm not.
- Not directly.

368
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:23,573
- What about indirectly?
- Who knows what Don Quixote can accomplish?

369
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:31,412
- Who are you?
- Bartender.

370
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:33,354
Who knows everything.

371
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,450
Only God knows everything.

372
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:43,928
You don't really think
I'm God, do you?

373
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:49,131
- You're not just a bartender.
- No, that's true.

374
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,266
I own the place too.

375
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:59,073
<i>Hey. Hey.</i>

376
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,957
You want help Tonchi and Pete?

377
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:15,691
I think that's why I'm here.
Me too.

378
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,701
Wha-

379
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:25,403
<i>What can I do?
Be safety inspector.</i>

380
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,707
Boys, you heard Mr. Collins.

381
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:34,718
The shaft is closed
until the mine is ventilated.

382
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,777
He changed his mind.

383
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:38,914
Mr. Collins
don't change his mind.

384
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,084
He does when the head
of the Bureau of Mines talks to him.

385
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,095
I called my boss in Pittsburgh,
and he spoke to Mr. Collins...

386
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,825
<i>and convinced him
to rescind his order.</i>

387
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:56,099
<i>You did that on purpose.</i>

388
00:27:56,174 --> 00:28:00,167
I did it on purpose? You let it slip through
your hands! What are you talking about?

389
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,406
- Yeah!
- I did not!

390
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,075
Hold on a second. Let me call Mr. Collins
on the phone and straighten this thing out.

391
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:09,814
You go ahead and do that. In the
meantime, we're gonna load up. What?

392
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,419
Let 'em go.

393
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:20,931
<i>Come on.! Go.! Go.!</i>

394
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,933
Let's go!

395
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:27,627
No, no. You do your part, Sam.
Stawpah's right.

396
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,867
Wait a second.
No need for you to risk your life.

397
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:31,636
I'm a doctor.
If anybody's injured, I can help.

398
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,544
<i>Mutta.! You couldn't come anyway,
Sam. We don't have enough resurrectors.</i>

399
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:38,548
Resuscitators.
Yeah. Them too.

400
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,743
<i>Gooshie, uh, this isn't working.</i>

401
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:44,277
- I'm getting dizzy.
- We've hardly begun, Admiral.

402
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:47,654
<i>If we could only narrow
our search. Sam's birthday!</i>

403
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,853
<i>What about it?</i>

404
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:53,227
Wherever he is,
it's his birthday.

405
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:55,129
<i>How do you know?</i>

406
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,862
I don't- It's just a feeling.
I have a hunch.

407
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:01,235
Have Ziggy search his birthdays.

408
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:04,639
- Starting where?
- Uh, his first.

409
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,677
August 8,

410
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,145
1954.

411
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:12,411
<i>Hang on.!
To what?</i>

412
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:16,443
<i>If I'm Don Quixote, then Al is my Sancho.
Gunshots, Whooping]</i>

413
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,785
<i>There isn't anything
he wouldn't do for me.</i>

414
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,848
<i>Or you for him.</i>

415
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,916
Or me for him.

416
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:27,888
That's not true though.

417
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:34,400
There was a time once when he wanted me
to do something for him, and I didn't.

418
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:38,068
Could you have done it?

419
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:40,941
I could have tried.
Why didn't you try?

420
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:45,915
I wasn't there to save
his marriage... to Beth.

421
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:50,717
I was there to save an
undercover cop from being killed.

422
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,020
<i>I know you can't see me, Beth.</i>

423
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:59,260
But don't give up on me...

424
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:07,001
'cause I'm alive out there.

425
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:15,237
And someday, I'm gonna
come back home to you.

426
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:19,213
<i>So Beth thought Al was dead...</i>

427
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:22,651
<i>and married someone else,
because-</i>

428
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,280
'Cause I always play by the rules.

429
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:34,589
They found 'em.
They found 'em!

430
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,829
Jimmy! Jimmy!

431
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:41,736
<i>- My name is Pete.
- Well, of course, it is.</i>

432
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:45,298
Set 'em up, Al!
The drinks are on me!

433
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,572
Two more minutes,
and they would've drowned.

434
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:52,138
Ah, you had good idea
to fool mine police!

435
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:57,011
Only I didn't fool 'em.
It was Stawpah's idea.

436
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:59,886
<i>Stawpah.!</i>

437
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,374
Where'd he go?
Who?

438
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,933
Where'd he go? Stawpah.
Stawpah. Stawpah?

439
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:23,708
Someone named Steve?
Stawpah, not Steve!

440
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:26,272
Stawpah means "Steve"
in Russian.

441
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,478
Yeah! Fine! Stawpah,
Steve, whatever.

442
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,612
<i>The guy who was at that table-
where did he go?</i>

443
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:32,679
What're you talking about?

444
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:36,183
<i>We done it tonight.</i>

445
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,453
He was sittin' right there, and-

446
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,465
and then he was...

447
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:46,196
surrounded by some blue light,

448
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:50,037
and then electricity passed
all through his body,

449
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:54,101
and... then he disappeared.

450
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:57,479
Whatever Sam's drinking,
I'll have one!

451
00:31:57,548 --> 00:32:01,917
Me too. Me three! Me
three! Me three! Me three!

452
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,279
<i>He leaped.
And four.</i>

453
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:08,223
That must be what
it looks like to leap.

454
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:11,023
Stawpah-
Stawpah was a leaper!

455
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,655
<i>Stawpah was a Ukranian.</i>

456
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:20,271
I come over on boat
with Stawpah.

457
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:26,801
So then you know Stawpah?

458
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:30,180
Hmm.

459
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:35,379
Stawpah and I work Marianna mine
till I move Cokeburg.

460
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:39,150
He best damn loader I ever saw.

461
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,714
That's right. That's right.
That's what he told me.

462
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,660
He said he could load 24 tons
in one day!

463
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:47,664
Nobody can load 24 ton,
not even Stawpah.

464
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:51,224
But he come damn close.

465
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,865
<i>Then Marianna mine blow up,</i>

466
00:32:56,941 --> 00:33:01,844
and Stawpah only miner
come out of pit alive.

467
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:07,942
After that,
people look funny at him.

468
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:12,116
It was slate on his back.

469
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,249
Stoop him over.

470
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:18,728
Yeah. Yeah,
he was all-all stooped over.

471
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,730
But not because of the slate.

472
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:25,360
<i>He had arthritis
from loading the coal in water.</i>

473
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:27,700
How you know Stawpah?

474
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:31,264
Because I met him here... today!

475
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,572
- Stawpah?
- Yes!

476
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:37,205
He die in '33,

477
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:39,272
<i>20 years ago.</i>

478
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,395
<i>Gooshie.! I'm gonna ralph.!</i>

479
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:55,261
- Ralph?
- Barf. Spew. Upchuck.

480
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:59,030
Make like Mount St. Helens.
I'm gonna blow chunks!

481
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:01,230
Oh, uh, regurgitate.

482
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,535
You got it. I'm out of here.

483
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:13,943
I was about to suggest
a break anyway, Admiral.

484
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:16,714
Look, look, we scanned all
of Dr. Beckett's birthdays...

485
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:19,780
from 1954 through the end
of the 21 st century.

486
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:22,690
And wherever he is,
it's not his birthday.

487
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:27,054
Unless, of course, you literally
meant his birthday.

488
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:30,931
- What?
- Well, we started the search on his first birthday.

489
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:35,336
We never checked
the actual day he was born.

490
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,405
Oh, my God.

491
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:43,580
<i>My leap had taken a quantum twist.</i>

492
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:46,310
<i>I no longer knew what was real
and what was imagined,</i>

493
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:48,875
<i>and, if imagined,
whose mind was imagining it-</i>

494
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:50,944
<i>mine or someone else's.</i>

495
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:53,013
You created all of this,
didn't you?

496
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,889
I built the bar,
if that's what you mean.

497
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,019
This is more than just a bar.

498
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,257
There is something special
about this place.

499
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:02,595
Dead men save miners' lives...

500
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,158
and then vanish
into an aura of blue light?

501
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:07,966
Yeah, I'd say there's something special
about this place, all right.

502
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,599
Books are full of the dead
saving the living.

503
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,610
<i>So Stawpah was here?</i>

504
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,973
- I remember him.
- Why don't they?

505
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,676
- That's the way it is.
- "That's the way it is"?

506
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:23,652
One moment he's one of them,
and the next he's just a memory,

507
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:26,281
and all you can say is,
"That's the way it is"?

508
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:30,521
Sometimes
"That's the way it is"...

509
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,654
is the best explanation.

510
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,722
Not for me.

511
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,792
I'm not sure you're ready for more.

512
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,498
Try me.

513
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:07,260
Can you accept
what you see as reality?

514
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:10,624
Which reality do I accept?

515
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,995
That one or-or that one?

516
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,563
Haven't you accepted both,
looking in all those mirrors?

517
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:22,712
<i>You are the one who's been
leaping me, aren't you?</i>

518
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,710
I wouldn't say that.
Well, what would you say?

519
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:30,618
That he's been leaping you
through time.

520
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,825
No.

521
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:38,726
No, no, no.

522
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:42,493
No way. No way will I buy that.

523
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,694
Why did you create
Project Quantum Leap, Sam?

524
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,433
To travel in time. Why did you
want to travel through time?

525
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:54,535
Because... I w-w- I wanted to, um-

526
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:57,342
To make the world a better place?

527
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,610
Of course.
To make the world a better place.

528
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:02,084
To put right
what once went wrong?

529
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:05,384
Yes. But not one life at a time.

530
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:07,447
Oh! I got Mother Teresa here.

531
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:10,722
Do you really think that all you've
done is change a few lives?

532
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,387
Basically, yes.

533
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:15,591
At the risk of overinflating your ego,
Sam, you've done more.

534
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,896
The lives you've touched...

535
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,903
touched others,

536
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:21,962
and those lives, others.

537
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:26,610
You've done a lot of good,
Sam Beckett,

538
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:28,645
and you can do a lot more.

539
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:31,443
I don't want to do more.

540
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:34,348
I want to go home.
They why haven't you?

541
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,945
Because I don't control my future.
You do!

542
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:42,322
Sam, you will only do this
as long as you want to.

543
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:45,021
Are you saying I can leap home
anytime I want?

544
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,588
Technically, yes.
What's the catch?

545
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,634
The catch...

546
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:53,864
is that you have to accept
that you control your own destiny.

547
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:59,605
<i>We're getting a lock.</i>

548
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:07,479
Thank God! Sam! Quick!
Come on outside! Outside.

549
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:09,644
Al!

550
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:14,089
Come on. Outside, Sam.
Whew.

551
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,019
<i>Come here. Hey.!
Ah, it's so good to see you.</i>

552
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:20,859
I can't believe you finally got here.
I never thought I was gonna find you.

553
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:24,662
You're here. I'm here. But
where is here? Al's Place.

554
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,862
I always wanted my own bar.

555
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,962
Yeah. This is more than a bar, Al.
Uh-huh.

556
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,168
This is where it all started.
Eh, what started?

557
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:36,236
Quantum Leap. Ah, but, no- but
this isn't- this isn't New Mexico.

558
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,179
No. No, no.
Not the project.

559
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,240
You remember
the first time I leaped,

560
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:45,756
and we all felt that someone
or something grabbed me?

561
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,314
Yeah?

562
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:54,658
He's the someone or something
that grabbed me.

563
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:58,895
<i>Who, the bartender?
Yeah.</i>

564
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:01,529
<i>That bartender's
been leaping me around.</i>

565
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:04,199
He wants me to believe
that I'm the one leaping me,

566
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:06,209
but I-I, uh-

567
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:11,042
I think it's him.

568
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:15,051
Al, one of the miners in there
is Moe Stein.

569
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,383
Captain Galaxy.
Remember Captain Galaxy?

570
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:20,583
Only here his- his name's Ziggy.

571
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:23,126
And Frank and Jimmy LaMotta
are in there,

572
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,458
only here their names
are Tonchi and Pete.

573
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,293
And there's a guy named Gooshie
in there with a long beard.

574
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,392
Sam. But he doesn't look
anything like our Gooshie, right?

575
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,369
Sam?
But he's got the same bad breath.

576
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:36,497
Sam, uh, I think we'd better
get you out of here.

577
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:40,738
No, Al. Please. Please.
Everything I'm telling you is the truth.

578
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:44,941
Uh, yeah. Uh, you haven't been
leaped around by God or fate or time,

579
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:48,041
but, no, you've been leaped
by a bartender.

580
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:51,316
<i>He's notjust a bartender.
That's what I'm trying to tell you, Al.</i>

581
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,750
I think he is God...

582
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:58,488
or time or-or fate...

583
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:02,089
or maybe even something
that we've never even thought of.

584
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:04,293
Gooshie!
Al?

585
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:08,429
When I leap, do I turn all blue
and tingle with electrical energy?

586
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:12,340
I don't know. When you leap, I
go back into the imaging chamber.

587
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:17,211
I bet I do. I bet I turn all blue and tingle with
electrical energy, the same way that he did when he leaped.

588
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:20,409
Only nobody leaped back in,
but that's probably because he was dead.

589
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:23,044
Oh, that's it. I'm outta here.
Al!

590
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,214
All those stories of dead souls...

591
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,315
<i>coming back to warn the living?</i>

592
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:33,459
What if they're all leapers
like Stawpah? Stawpah?

593
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:37,126
Yeah. Stawpah, this guy
who was here, and he leaped.

594
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:40,136
He-
Stawpah is "Steve" in Russian.

595
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:42,968
I know what it means.

596
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,531
I've got an uncle named Stawpah.

597
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:50,044
Does he have, um-

598
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,105
uh, rheumatoid arthritis, Al?

599
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:55,810
Yeah. It's got-

600
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:58,320
It's got him all twisted up
like a pretzel.

601
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,553
It's not funny.

602
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:11,991
- Ah, but it is.
- Why?

603
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:18,404
I don't know, Al.
It just is.

604
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:22,842
Uh, just take it easy.

605
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:26,246
I'm gonna go back
and figure this out with Ziggy.

606
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,251
But...

607
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,810
I'm gonna get you out of this.

608
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:35,081
Whatever it takes, I'll-

609
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,150
I'll get you out of this.

610
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:51,597
Al's uncle.

611
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,939
I've always found
coincidence amusing.

612
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:58,481
Uh-huh.

613
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:04,751
And you still want me to believe
that I'm leaping me?

614
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,548
Sam, if you became a priest-

615
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:10,958
- I've been a priest.
- So you have.

616
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:15,255
If the priesthood had been
your chosen life,

617
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:18,529
even though the church might
move you from parish to parish,

618
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:21,366
don't you have to accept responsibility
for the life you lead?

619
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:26,002
- Even priests can quit.
- That's true.

620
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:32,912
But they can also
take sabbaticals,

621
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:36,248
especially before embarking
on a difficult new assignment.

622
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:43,589
Are you telling me that the leaps
are gonna get tougher?

623
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:48,187
Where would you like to go, Sam?

624
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,837
Home.

625
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:05,946
I'd like to go home.

626
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:09,110
But I can't, can I?

627
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,717
I've got a wrong to put right for Al.

628
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:19,786
You knew that, didn't you?

629
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:28,137
God bless, Sam.

630
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:53,360
Beth.

631
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:59,663
Who are you?
H- How did you get in here?

632
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:02,035
I'm not gonna harm you.

633
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:05,166
<i>I'm here to help you.</i>

634
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:08,040
Help you and help Al.

635
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:10,637
Al?

636
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:18,018
You're a-You're a friend of Al's?

637
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,925
Yeah.

638
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:26,185
I'm a friend of Al's.

639
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,767
Do you think we could sit?

640
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,512
I'm gonna tell you a story, Beth.

641
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:56,382
<i>A story with a happy ending,</i>

642
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:59,952
but only if you believe me.

643
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,260
And if I don't?

644
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:04,323
You will.

645
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:07,303
I swear you will.

646
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:17,704
But instead of starting with,
"Once upon a time,"

647
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,147
let's start with the happy ending.

648
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:29,058
Al's alive,

649
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,251
and he's coming home.

650
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:37,299
Oh!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

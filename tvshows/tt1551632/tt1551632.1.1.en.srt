2
00:00:56,048 --> 00:00:58,581
Oh! Finally!

3
00:00:59,713 --> 00:01:00,781
You're still down by 10.

4
00:01:02,385 --> 00:01:04,052
Check. You beat me at everything.

5
00:01:04,053 --> 00:01:05,827
Let me be better
at something. Okay?

6
00:01:05,828 --> 00:01:06,455
Come on. You ready?

7
00:01:06,456 --> 00:01:08,558
Come on, come on. Ah!

8
00:01:12,128 --> 00:01:14,028
All right, all right,
all right. Here it is.

9
00:01:14,062 --> 00:01:15,595
Game point.

10
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:16,823
Rizzoli-Rizzoli.

11
00:01:16,824 --> 00:01:18,264
Take the shot!

12
00:01:18,298 --> 00:01:19,733
Yeah. Oh!

13
00:01:20,241 --> 00:01:21,279
Hey, hey, you all right?

14
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,783
Yeah, yeah. No, no.
Come on, let me see it.

15
00:01:22,784 --> 00:01:24,450
No, I'm good. Aw!

16
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:26,153
What? No, no, no, no.
That's bad. Come on.

17
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:27,900
Bad? Yeah, let's get you some ice.

18
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:28,924
Hold your head up,
hold your head up.

19
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:30,626
Come on. Come on, come on.

20
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,162
All right, all right.
All right, just don't touch.

21
00:01:32,196 --> 00:01:33,297
Oh, yeah, that's broken. Oh, yeah.

22
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:34,498
It's broken? Let me see.

23
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:35,882
Ow! God! Hey! Okay, okay.

24
00:01:35,883 --> 00:01:36,751
Why you got to do that?

25
00:01:36,752 --> 00:01:38,204
Well, let's get some
ice on it! Come on!

26
00:01:38,238 --> 00:01:39,272
Hurry up.

27
00:01:39,306 --> 00:01:40,189
Come on. Come on, come on.

28
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,186
Keep it up, keep it up. It's up.

29
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:43,466
Get something before
mom comes home.

30
00:01:43,467 --> 00:01:44,689
All right, all right, all right.
Here. Thank you very much.

31
00:01:44,723 --> 00:01:46,519
There you go. Thank you.

32
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,021
On the good towel!

33
00:01:48,022 --> 00:01:49,523
What?

34
00:01:49,558 --> 00:01:51,459
Excuse me. Aah!

35
00:01:51,493 --> 00:01:54,697
What happened?! God!

36
00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:57,367
How do you always manage
to turn Sunday dinner

37
00:01:57,401 --> 00:02:00,805
into a circus every week?

38
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:01,569
Me? Yeah, you.

39
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,641
It was my fault. I did it.
It's his fault!

40
00:02:03,676 --> 00:02:05,510
No, I know you
didn't mean to do it.

41
00:02:05,545 --> 00:02:07,079
So this is my fault?

42
00:02:07,114 --> 00:02:09,449
Look, I tell you all the time,

43
00:02:09,484 --> 00:02:11,853
don't roughhouse with him!

44
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:19,225
Oh, someone, uh -
bird! Bird keeps calling you.

45
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:20,593
Detective Crowe?

46
00:02:21,126 --> 00:02:22,260
You answered my phone?

47
00:02:22,294 --> 00:02:23,595
Ma, why didn't you just tell me?!

48
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:26,399
Because you were
having so much fun

49
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:28,383
having your... Rizzoli.

50
00:02:28,384 --> 00:02:30,409
It's Frost. Bad things
in West Roxbury.

51
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,637
All right, I'll be right there.

52
00:02:31,638 --> 00:02:34,211
Dad and Tommy are gonna be
here any minute for dinner.

53
00:02:34,212 --> 00:02:35,979
I told you I was on call.

54
00:02:36,014 --> 00:02:40,418
Here. It won't be attractive
if your nose swells up.

55
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:43,922
You never know who
you might run into.

56
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:45,324
Ma. What?

57
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:47,093
'Cause I meet so many
great guys at work.

58
00:02:47,127 --> 00:02:50,097
Too bad they're all dead. Huh?

59
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:53,300
Ow. Later, jerk.

60
00:02:53,335 --> 00:02:54,034
I'm sorry. No, you're not.

61
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:55,303
Okay. Have fun! Yeah, thanks.

62
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,834
News of a brutal murder

63
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:24,552
of a doctor in an upscale
Bellevue Hill neighborhood

64
00:03:24,553 --> 00:03:27,341
in West Roxbury
shocked and terrified

65
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,510
this tight-knit community...

66
00:03:31,847 --> 00:03:34,015
It's the coroner. Go, go.

67
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:36,685
Dr. Isles, what can you
tell us about the murder?

68
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,222
I'll have a statement for
you later tonight, kitty.

69
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:43,325
Detective. What's up, doc?

70
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:45,225
Evening, Dr. Isles. 
Hello, Casey.

71
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,060
Dr. Maura Isles, chief
medical examiner.

72
00:03:50,462 --> 00:03:52,896
Come on, it's your lucky day.

73
00:03:53,393 --> 00:03:54,635
Can't say this on camera,

74
00:03:54,636 --> 00:03:57,498
but we call Dr. Isles "Queen of the dead."

75
00:03:57,532 --> 00:03:58,832
What's that, Crowe?

76
00:03:58,867 --> 00:04:00,701
Oh, geez, take a midol.

77
00:04:00,735 --> 00:04:01,701
Commander cleared you?

78
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:03,369
What's it to you? It's my case.

79
00:04:03,404 --> 00:04:06,072
Since when? I'm up.
I got clearance. Move.

80
00:04:06,106 --> 00:04:08,407
I just spoke to the commander.
It's my case. Where's Frost?

81
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:10,375
Losing his lunch... where else?

82
00:04:11,577 --> 00:04:12,677
God.

83
00:04:12,712 --> 00:04:14,245
He should've stayed in robbery.

84
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:16,747
Hangnails make him gag.
Guy gives us a bad name.

85
00:04:16,782 --> 00:04:18,649
Hey, come on. Leave him alone.

86
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,251
You okay, buddy? Something I ate.

87
00:04:24,287 --> 00:04:25,664
Where's the crime scene?

88
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:28,056
Follow your nose.
Might bring back some memories.

89
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,357
What's that supposed to mean?

90
00:04:29,391 --> 00:04:30,491
You'll see.

91
00:04:30,526 --> 00:04:33,727
Have fun, Rizzoli.

92
00:04:36,564 --> 00:04:38,232
Hands hurt?

93
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:39,766
It's gonna rain.

94
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,401
Rizzoli... homicide Victor 825.

95
00:04:42,436 --> 00:04:46,538
Going back for more, Frost?

96
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:58,441
Wow. Not in south
Boston anymore, Dorothy.

97
00:05:01,778 --> 00:05:03,545
Korsak, I thought you
were on vacation.

98
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:05,214
Cut it short.

99
00:05:05,777 --> 00:05:06,882
That bad?

100
00:05:06,917 --> 00:05:08,517
Worse.

101
00:05:23,874 --> 00:05:24,999
Oh, man.

102
00:05:26,497 --> 00:05:27,863
10 centimeters.

103
00:05:27,864 --> 00:05:28,996
Jane, if you got this,

104
00:05:28,997 --> 00:05:31,505
I can start processing
the rest of the house.

105
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:32,706
Yeah, go ahead.

106
00:05:35,342 --> 00:05:38,077
Carotid artery and jugular
have been transected.

107
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:40,612
What's odd is how precise it is.

108
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,450
Hairline fracture
of the nasal bone

109
00:05:46,485 --> 00:05:48,118
above the lateral nasal cartilage.

110
00:05:48,954 --> 00:05:49,893
It's not disfiguring.

111
00:05:49,894 --> 00:05:51,555
Looks pretty disfiguring to me.

112
00:05:52,357 --> 00:05:54,490
Can you pop this out for me?

113
00:05:55,114 --> 00:05:58,027
Can't you do something
safe, like yoga?

114
00:05:58,061 --> 00:05:59,228
Might hurt a little.

115
00:05:59,262 --> 00:06:00,520
Okay.

116
00:06:01,518 --> 00:06:03,832
Hmm. Okay.

117
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:06,398
Ow! "A little"?

118
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,494
Put some ice on it
for the next 24 hours

119
00:06:08,495 --> 00:06:09,466
so you don't look like Mike Tyson.

120
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:11,166
Ooh! Ow! Mnh!

121
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,133
Victim is Dr. Martin Yeager, 34.

122
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:15,669
Wife, Gail, is missing.

123
00:06:15,703 --> 00:06:17,770
Diamond was too small so she
whacked him and walked out?

124
00:06:17,805 --> 00:06:21,374
No. We found signs
of forced entry.

125
00:06:23,444 --> 00:06:25,745
Well-to-do couple.

126
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:30,582
Man is bound and posed.
Woman is missing.

127
00:06:34,653 --> 00:06:35,887
And a teacup.

128
00:06:44,761 --> 00:06:47,495
Is he out? Is the surgeon out?

129
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:52,032
Oh, my God. Korsak?

130
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:53,100
He's not out. Itl.

131
00:06:53,134 --> 00:06:53,934
Why didn't you warn us -
warn Jane, at least?

132
00:06:53,968 --> 00:06:55,402
I wanted your unbiased assessment.

133
00:06:55,436 --> 00:06:57,370
Looks like Hoyt, right?

134
00:06:57,404 --> 00:06:59,404
Korsak, we put that son
of a bitch behind bars.

135
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:00,972
You tell me how this is possible.

136
00:07:01,006 --> 00:07:02,773
It's not. I spoke with
the prison authorities.

137
00:07:02,808 --> 00:07:04,275
He's in lockdown.

138
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,680
Look, stun-gun marks, right
there, just like Hoyt's victims.

139
00:07:10,714 --> 00:07:12,281
Any sick perp could've done this

140
00:07:12,315 --> 00:07:14,183
if he watched the tv
news and read a paper.

141
00:07:14,218 --> 00:07:15,551
We got a copycat.

142
00:07:15,586 --> 00:07:17,653
Except we didn't
release this detail.

143
00:07:18,922 --> 00:07:21,991
Hoyt's trained an apprentice.

144
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,533
Hey, uh, can I get a scanner
from you? Thank you.

145
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,636
He's coming out of rigor.
You want us to crack him?

146
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,804
No, put him on his side.

147
00:07:42,206 --> 00:07:45,008
Hoyt's the reason you don't
want to be partners, isn't he?

148
00:07:45,042 --> 00:07:46,742
You know why...

149
00:07:47,256 --> 00:07:50,246
I'm allergic to all those sad
and furry little creatures

150
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,582
you keep rescuing,
Detective Dolittle.

151
00:07:52,616 --> 00:07:54,683
You never sneezed. 
Hello.

152
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:57,586
Special Agent Gabriel Dean.

153
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,556
You must be Detective Rizzoli.

154
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,957
And you must be Dr. Maura Isles.

155
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:08,693
What's the FBI doing here?

156
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:11,729
Saw the homicide advisory...
And possible kidnapping.

157
00:08:11,763 --> 00:08:13,764
We have an APB out on Gail Yeager.

158
00:08:13,798 --> 00:08:15,032
Yeah, so do we.

159
00:08:15,066 --> 00:08:16,400
You get a lot of
routine advisories.

160
00:08:16,434 --> 00:08:18,101
What so special about this one?

161
00:08:18,612 --> 00:08:21,199
Hey, you know we're on
the same side, right?

162
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:22,906
Are we?

163
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,573
Oh, 'cause, you
know, you fed boys,

164
00:08:25,574 --> 00:08:27,941
you like to show up, take
the bat and the ball.

165
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,078
Just here to observe.

166
00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:36,880
Right.

167
00:08:38,715 --> 00:08:41,250
Jane, I'll be doing the
autopsy in the morning.

168
00:08:41,285 --> 00:08:43,152
Okay. Come if you like.

169
00:08:48,786 --> 00:08:50,727
Hey, Rizzoli. Yeah?

170
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:52,628
Semen.

171
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:59,807
So he raped the wife and
made the husband watch...

172
00:08:59,841 --> 00:09:01,809
Just like Hoyt.

173
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,363
Look at me. Look at me!

174
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:43,539
Jane... how lovely to see you.

175
00:09:44,608 --> 00:09:47,276
Haven't seen you since the trial.

176
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,910
Get his ass in the chair.

177
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:58,618
I like that scent...

178
00:09:58,652 --> 00:10:02,688
the smell of lavender and fear.

179
00:10:02,722 --> 00:10:05,457
See one. Do one. Teach one.

180
00:10:05,491 --> 00:10:08,560
That's what they taught
you in medical school.

181
00:10:08,594 --> 00:10:09,994
Who did you teach, Hoyt?

182
00:10:10,028 --> 00:10:12,930
I dropped out, Jane.
I mean, you know that.

183
00:10:12,964 --> 00:10:16,533
You were kicked out...
For fondling a corpse.

184
00:10:21,138 --> 00:10:22,905
That's very good, Jane.

185
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:25,039
You've learned how to irritate me.

186
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:31,678
I want to see them.

187
00:10:31,712 --> 00:10:34,347
Hands are so useful.

188
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:36,682
Dexterous.

189
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:39,785
And yours played the piano.
Do they still work?

190
00:11:01,672 --> 00:11:05,407
Good as new.

191
00:11:05,442 --> 00:11:08,610
So...Your turn.

192
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:11,512
You trained somebody, didn't you?

193
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,646
I love...

194
00:11:13,681 --> 00:11:15,113
Your neck.

195
00:11:15,148 --> 00:11:18,349
It's so beautiful.

196
00:11:18,384 --> 00:11:21,385
And your breasts...

197
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:23,253
Very firm.

198
00:11:23,287 --> 00:11:25,422
Answer the question.

199
00:11:29,296 --> 00:11:30,963
Tell me, Jane...

200
00:11:30,998 --> 00:11:35,869
What would you like to do to me?

201
00:11:39,841 --> 00:11:41,708
I'd like to get my gun...

202
00:11:42,977 --> 00:11:45,545
...And put it in your mouth
and pull the trigger.

203
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,313
No, no, no, no, no.

204
00:11:47,348 --> 00:11:51,484
It is so much better
slowly, to take your time.

205
00:11:52,158 --> 00:11:53,586
You know, all my life,

206
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,488
I've been meticulous about
finishing what I start.

207
00:11:56,523 --> 00:11:57,923
And that bothers me,

208
00:11:57,957 --> 00:12:00,359
because I haven't finished
what I started with you.

209
00:12:00,394 --> 00:12:03,130
And you won't, you sick scumbag.

210
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:07,804
Do you dream about me, Jane?

211
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:10,195
'Cause I dream about you.

212
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,559
I don't even think about you.

213
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,883
But I'll tell you what -
I'll visit you every damn day

214
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:17,104
if you tell me who your friend is.

215
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:20,370
Who killed Dr. Yeager, here's his wife?

216
00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:28,785
I see that our time's up.

217
00:12:35,048 --> 00:12:37,783
I do dream about you.

218
00:12:39,986 --> 00:12:40,968
Am I ever your lover?

219
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,921
That's enough, you son of a bitch!
That's enough!

220
00:12:43,956 --> 00:12:45,623
All right, all right, all right.

221
00:12:50,808 --> 00:12:53,300
You're right, Jane.

222
00:12:53,301 --> 00:12:54,895
I should play fair.

223
00:12:55,454 --> 00:12:57,655
My friend is out there.

224
00:12:57,689 --> 00:12:59,356
Enjoy him.

225
00:13:01,092 --> 00:13:03,494
Because he'll enjoy you.

226
00:13:13,764 --> 00:13:16,003
Rizzoli.

227
00:13:37,876 --> 00:13:40,744
Hey, uh, I'll catch up.

228
00:13:58,727 --> 00:14:00,494
Are you wearing lipstick, Rizzoli?

229
00:14:00,528 --> 00:14:01,728
Shut up.

230
00:14:01,763 --> 00:14:03,631
Dog find her? Yeah.
Lucky he got loose.

231
00:14:03,665 --> 00:14:05,101
We wouldn't have found
her till summer.

232
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,969
Who's a good boy?

233
00:14:08,572 --> 00:14:10,472
How'd you get here so fast?

234
00:14:10,507 --> 00:14:12,608
I was in the area.

235
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,578
Everybody's so lucky today.

236
00:14:20,251 --> 00:14:22,117
Vitreous potassium.

237
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:25,291
Helps us determine
postmortem interval.

238
00:14:25,325 --> 00:14:28,895
Nice and clear... about 36 hours.

239
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,501
Look at the body, the
way it's laid out...

240
00:14:33,535 --> 00:14:37,038
like she's taking a nap
or reading a novel.

241
00:14:37,072 --> 00:14:39,074
It's odd, isn't it?

242
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:41,509
Yeah, why didn't he bury her?

243
00:14:42,811 --> 00:14:44,145
Didn't have time.

244
00:14:46,514 --> 00:14:49,115
That means something.

245
00:14:50,852 --> 00:14:52,519
Aah!

246
00:14:58,719 --> 00:14:59,519
Where's Frost?

247
00:14:59,553 --> 00:15:01,154
Ah, paperwork.

248
00:15:01,188 --> 00:15:03,556
Oh. Wiping his face
with it after he puked?

249
00:15:06,037 --> 00:15:08,226
Did you do a wet prep yet?

250
00:15:09,628 --> 00:15:13,664
I hadn't planned to. But I can.

251
00:15:19,069 --> 00:15:21,670
Those little guys
really are swimmers.

252
00:15:22,773 --> 00:15:23,929
Quite fresh.

253
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,855
Deposited postmortem.

254
00:15:25,856 --> 00:15:27,190
Ugh.

255
00:15:27,224 --> 00:15:28,197
How did you know?

256
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:30,071
I didn't. Yes, you did.

257
00:15:30,508 --> 00:15:31,941
It's not standard procedure

258
00:15:31,975 --> 00:15:34,510
to check for evidence
of necrophilia.

259
00:15:34,544 --> 00:15:37,479
You want to tell us why
you're really here?

260
00:15:37,513 --> 00:15:39,748
I'd like a copy of your report...

261
00:15:39,782 --> 00:15:42,916
as a courtesy.

262
00:16:14,476 --> 00:16:17,278
Let's go, Hoyt. You got
your one hour on the yard.

263
00:16:18,613 --> 00:16:20,914
He's faking. Be careful.

264
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:39,363
I found carpet fiber
on Gail Yeager's body.

265
00:16:39,397 --> 00:16:42,866
Lab is processing it.

266
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,036
Thanks.

267
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:48,171
Hoyt didn't meet his
apprentice in prison

268
00:16:48,857 --> 00:16:51,741
or medical school -
all 80 classmates are clean.

269
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,588
You guys eating cat food?

270
00:16:55,622 --> 00:16:57,422
Yeah, you want some?

271
00:16:57,457 --> 00:16:58,823
No.

272
00:16:58,858 --> 00:17:01,159
Guess it's a chick thing.

273
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:03,494
What's up?

274
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:05,663
You may want to sit down.

275
00:17:05,697 --> 00:17:06,997
No. Tell me.

276
00:17:07,031 --> 00:17:08,931
A few hours ago, uh,

277
00:17:08,966 --> 00:17:12,634
Charles Hoyt escaped custody.

278
00:17:15,671 --> 00:17:17,371
Oh, my God.

279
00:17:20,642 --> 00:17:22,943
Why wasn't he cuffed?

280
00:17:22,978 --> 00:17:25,279
Two doctors have assured me he
was suffering from appendicitis.

281
00:17:25,313 --> 00:17:27,180
200 milligrams of decadron

282
00:17:27,215 --> 00:17:28,948
would give him an
abnormal white-cell count.

283
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:30,721
It mimics all the symptoms.

284
00:17:30,722 --> 00:17:33,852
Doesn't explain how
he got out of here.

285
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,220
What's he doing?

286
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:42,117
It's a message for me.

287
00:17:45,203 --> 00:17:47,131
Go stay with mom and dad.

288
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,670
No. I am staying in my own home.

289
00:17:49,671 --> 00:17:51,805
He's not gonna do
this to me again.

290
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:54,874
Frost, go get some sleep.
I'm fine.

291
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,009
If I was a guy, you wouldn't
be worried like this.

292
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:58,343
You're not a guy.

293
00:17:58,378 --> 00:17:59,811
No, I am a homicide detective.

294
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,446
And he is not gonna kill me.

295
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,619
Really? Well, he almost
did the last time.

296
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,581
I mean, look at your hands!

297
00:18:04,582 --> 00:18:05,829
Hey, Frankie, come on.

298
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,784
Please take him.

299
00:18:08,498 --> 00:18:10,766
We'll be outside.

300
00:18:12,035 --> 00:18:14,502
All right, all right, that's
the way you want it, fine.

301
00:18:14,537 --> 00:18:17,032
But if you have a boyfriend
over, we'll know. How's that?

302
00:18:41,699 --> 00:18:43,145
Hey, Marisa. Hey.

303
00:18:43,146 --> 00:18:45,101
I'm so sorry. Did the
vacuum cleaner wake you?

304
00:18:45,135 --> 00:18:47,303
No, no. I was up studying.

305
00:18:47,337 --> 00:18:49,738
Uh, come in, come in, come in.

306
00:18:49,772 --> 00:18:52,373
How's law school? Awful.

307
00:18:52,408 --> 00:18:54,875
Remind me again why I thought
I wanted to be a lawyer.

308
00:18:56,544 --> 00:18:59,313
I know, right? "Where the
hell was I on career day?"

309
00:18:59,933 --> 00:19:02,515
Just making sure you're okay.

310
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:06,352
Um...Yeah. Why would you ask?

311
00:19:06,386 --> 00:19:09,854
You always vacuum when you
have a really tough case.

312
00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:12,357
Huh.

313
00:19:12,391 --> 00:19:14,058
No!

314
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:28,670
Mom.

315
00:19:29,872 --> 00:19:33,741
That lipstick doesn't flatter you.
It's too pink, babe.

316
00:19:35,343 --> 00:19:36,977
Bye.

317
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:44,783
I hope Frankie Jr.'s okay down there.

318
00:19:44,818 --> 00:19:47,286
Hoyt's not after Frankie, ma.

319
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,020
Your father's out there, also.

320
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,722
Oh, my God, did you
bring the dog, too?

321
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:54,191
Why would I bring the dog?

322
00:19:59,068 --> 00:20:00,707
What, ma?

323
00:20:01,065 --> 00:20:03,433
Oh, come on, it's the
middle of the night.

324
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:04,868
Who could sleep?

325
00:20:04,902 --> 00:20:07,536
Ever since you had this crazy idea

326
00:20:07,571 --> 00:20:10,172
to become a police officer,

327
00:20:10,206 --> 00:20:11,607
I haven't stopped worrying.

328
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:13,442
I never know if
you're coming home.

329
00:20:13,476 --> 00:20:17,977
And your brother Frankie wants
to do exactly what you do.

330
00:20:18,471 --> 00:20:21,413
Everything you do, he follows it.

331
00:20:21,448 --> 00:20:23,515
I'm leaving.

332
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:25,417
You're leaving?
Where are you going?

333
00:20:25,451 --> 00:20:28,186
Someplace where you're not.

334
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,453
Jane.

335
00:20:29,488 --> 00:20:31,722
Jane, come on. Be reasonable.

336
00:20:31,756 --> 00:20:33,757
They don't pay you enough money.

337
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,359
I mean... pfft -
they don't pay me at all.

338
00:20:54,408 --> 00:20:56,242
Why do you always look like

339
00:20:56,276 --> 00:20:58,611
you're about to do a photo shoot?

340
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:02,080
Thank you.

341
00:21:05,584 --> 00:21:07,284
God, what is that?!

342
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:09,486
Shh. You'll scare him.

343
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,088
He's alive? His name is Bass.

344
00:21:12,123 --> 00:21:15,424
Geochelone sulcata -
African spurred tortoise.

345
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,093
I've had him since
he was like this big.

346
00:21:18,127 --> 00:21:21,229
He's partial to
British strawberries.

347
00:21:21,263 --> 00:21:22,596
"Bass"?

348
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,564
What, after an old boyfriend?

349
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:27,200
William M. Bass, the
forensic anthropologist

350
00:21:27,234 --> 00:21:28,601
who founded the famous body farm.

351
00:21:28,635 --> 00:21:30,769
Right, yeah, that... that Bass.

352
00:21:30,804 --> 00:21:32,604
No, it's okay.

353
00:21:33,227 --> 00:21:36,441
Yeah, he's a great pet.
Really interactive, I'll bet.

354
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:37,809
Mm-hmm.

355
00:21:42,981 --> 00:21:45,615
So, how long can a person
go without sleeping?

356
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,750
Hallucinations begin by day four,

357
00:21:47,785 --> 00:21:52,222
followed by slurred speech,
short attention span, and death.

358
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,324
You're better than Wikipedia.

359
00:21:54,358 --> 00:21:57,260
Well, Wikipedia is
frequently incorrect.

360
00:21:57,294 --> 00:21:58,995
Very little is
rigorously peer-reviewed.

361
00:22:02,795 --> 00:22:05,068
Somebody's just
dropping something off.

362
00:22:17,346 --> 00:22:18,913
Hey.

363
00:22:37,761 --> 00:22:39,762
Go away. I'm asleep.

364
00:22:46,502 --> 00:22:48,202
Are we having a sleepover,

365
00:22:48,237 --> 00:22:51,471
or is this your way of telling
me you're attracted to me?

366
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:56,674
So it was Dean you were expecting.

367
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:02,511
He wanted my opinion
on another case.

368
00:23:02,993 --> 00:23:04,084
What case?

369
00:23:04,085 --> 00:23:05,485
I can't say.

370
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:08,421
Fine. Go sleep in your own room.

371
00:23:08,455 --> 00:23:10,623
Jane...

372
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:15,760
Did you ever like the same
guy as your best friend?

373
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:17,095
No.

374
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:18,663
Did you ever have a best friend?

375
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:20,097
No.

376
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:23,133
You'd tell me if you
were a cyborg, right?

377
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:25,936
No, I don't think I would.

378
00:23:28,105 --> 00:23:29,572
I'm not seeing him.

379
00:23:29,606 --> 00:23:31,607
Yet.

380
00:23:31,641 --> 00:23:33,342
Well, somebody should,
don't you think?

381
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,377
Yup.

382
00:23:36,057 --> 00:23:38,913
Should we draw straws?

383
00:23:38,947 --> 00:23:41,215
Couldn't we just show him
our tits and let him decide?

384
00:23:47,521 --> 00:23:49,956
It's okay. It's just Bass.

385
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,858
Really, it's okay.

386
00:24:00,832 --> 00:24:04,867
I've never been so
scared in all my life.

387
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:25,335
You look like you slept
under an overpass.

388
00:24:25,536 --> 00:24:27,504
How are you still single?

389
00:24:32,276 --> 00:24:34,143
You got to stop this. Stop what?

390
00:24:34,178 --> 00:24:36,244
This stuff with Frost.

391
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:38,210
Lab identified the carpet
we found on the victim.

392
00:24:38,245 --> 00:24:40,409
It's called antron.

393
00:24:40,443 --> 00:24:43,145
It... it's not Frost's fault
that he was partnered with me.

394
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:45,046
Navy-blue carpet from a car.

395
00:24:47,082 --> 00:24:49,049
You want to hear what I
got from the lab or not?

396
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:50,650
Yeah. You want to
drink the coffee?

397
00:24:50,685 --> 00:24:52,919
Navy blue's a popular color.

398
00:24:52,953 --> 00:24:55,321
2 million vehicles with
this type of carpet fiber.

399
00:24:55,355 --> 00:24:58,123
Swell. Hey, it's not my
fault it's a popular color.

400
00:24:59,192 --> 00:25:00,770
I take three sugar.

401
00:25:00,771 --> 00:25:02,038
Oh, for Christ's sake, since when?

402
00:25:02,072 --> 00:25:03,539
Since I don't know -
since for a while.

403
00:25:03,573 --> 00:25:06,007
You'd know that if we
were still partners.

404
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:08,475
What about the semen
we found? No hits.

405
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:09,709
How is that possible?

406
00:25:09,744 --> 00:25:11,911
Easy. Our unsub's not in CODIS.

407
00:25:11,945 --> 00:25:14,246
Ran the prints we
had, too... nothing.

408
00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:15,814
Our unsub's a ghost.

409
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:19,317
Pardon me... yours and
Frost's unsub's a ghost.

410
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:23,889
Thought you said you
take three sugar.

411
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:25,690
Doctor says it's bad for me.

412
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:27,192
Two sugars is bad for you.
The creamer is bad for you.

413
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:29,560
Like you care. That's it.

414
00:25:37,366 --> 00:25:38,700
Hey.

415
00:25:38,734 --> 00:25:41,202
About the other day...

416
00:25:41,235 --> 00:25:42,969
I should've given you a heads-up.

417
00:25:43,003 --> 00:25:44,771
It's okay.

418
00:25:44,805 --> 00:25:47,506
No, it... it's not.

419
00:25:49,008 --> 00:25:50,975
I'm sorry.

420
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:54,512
I'm sorry, too, Korsak.

421
00:25:59,551 --> 00:26:01,451
Rizzoli.

422
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,953
Where?

423
00:26:05,221 --> 00:26:06,355
Okay, page Frost.

424
00:26:07,891 --> 00:26:10,495
I got to go.
They found another victim.

425
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:31,284
His name is John Ghant.
His wife, Karena, is missing.

426
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:34,721
No sign of a teacup this time.
You know what that means.

427
00:26:34,755 --> 00:26:36,289
He didn't need a warning device

428
00:26:36,323 --> 00:26:37,957
because he had an accomplice.

429
00:26:37,991 --> 00:26:39,191
Hoyt.

430
00:26:39,226 --> 00:26:41,460
Jane?

431
00:26:42,629 --> 00:26:45,196
You better come see this.

432
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,698
Hey, all I know is,

433
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:50,400
I got a delivery for a
Detective, uh, Rizzoli.

434
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:52,369
That's me.

435
00:26:56,807 --> 00:26:58,207
Don't worry about that.

436
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,077
Let me see some form
of identification.

437
00:27:00,111 --> 00:27:01,548
I got it in my back pocket.

438
00:27:01,582 --> 00:27:02,816
Hoyt.

439
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,185
Then who's Henry Deduboto?

440
00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:10,455
"Ted Bundy."

441
00:27:10,489 --> 00:27:13,389
That's five letters too
many for that anagram.

442
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,255
How do you do that?

443
00:27:15,289 --> 00:27:17,289
Fine, "Theodore Bundy."

444
00:27:17,323 --> 00:27:19,423
He was fascinated
with necrophilia,

445
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:20,658
just like the apprentice.

446
00:27:20,692 --> 00:27:22,894
I bet that's why
Gail Yeager's body

447
00:27:22,928 --> 00:27:24,662
was laid out like his lover.

448
00:27:24,697 --> 00:27:28,199
So he could visit.
Any time he wanted.

449
00:27:28,234 --> 00:27:31,936
But we found her, so
he had to kill again,

450
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:34,471
this time with Hoyt.

451
00:27:34,505 --> 00:27:35,938
My guess is Karena Ghant
is his new girlfriend.

452
00:27:38,141 --> 00:27:40,741
Frost?

453
00:27:40,776 --> 00:27:42,409
Where?

454
00:27:42,444 --> 00:27:44,645
Keep it off the radio.
Take his phone.

455
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:47,281
Hide your car, all right?
I'm on my way.

456
00:27:48,353 --> 00:27:51,206
You are not gonna like
what we're about to do.

457
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:55,857
Only call he made was to 911.

458
00:27:55,858 --> 00:27:57,691
Dispatch put it
straight through to me.

459
00:27:57,726 --> 00:27:59,489
Good. What was he
doing way out here?

460
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:01,332
Looking for Indian arrowheads.

461
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:03,001
"Native American."

462
00:28:03,035 --> 00:28:05,570
The wampanoag tribe was the
last to inhabit the area,

463
00:28:05,604 --> 00:28:08,406
also known as the massachusett.

464
00:28:08,441 --> 00:28:10,709
Get him to a uniform.
Take him downtown.

465
00:28:10,743 --> 00:28:13,177
Hold him as long as you can.
Call Korsak, all right?

466
00:28:13,212 --> 00:28:14,779
Get him out here.
Tell him the plan.

467
00:28:14,813 --> 00:28:17,715
I'm on it. What plan?

468
00:28:17,749 --> 00:28:19,149
We're gonna surveille this body.

469
00:28:21,602 --> 00:28:23,965
What, you -
you mean, leave her here?

470
00:28:24,629 --> 00:28:25,679
Yes.

471
00:28:25,756 --> 00:28:27,489
I said you wouldn't like it.
Let's go.

472
00:28:27,523 --> 00:28:30,559
No. I'm calling my team.

473
00:28:30,593 --> 00:28:33,163
Maura, they weren't expecting
anyone to find this body.

474
00:28:33,164 --> 00:28:35,589
Look at where she's hidden.
Okay, hear me out.

475
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,515
Hear me out. We get
the hell out of here.

476
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:39,485
We put both the park
entrances under surveillance.

477
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:42,754
What makes you think that Hoyt
isn't watching you right now?

478
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:45,454
He might be. I am willing
to take that gamble.

479
00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:47,423
What, by leaving this body here

480
00:28:47,457 --> 00:28:48,791
in hopes that they'll return?

481
00:28:48,825 --> 00:28:50,800
No. No, every second
she stays here,

482
00:28:50,801 --> 00:28:53,328
more forensic evidence is lost.

483
00:28:54,628 --> 00:28:56,228
Maura, please.

484
00:28:56,262 --> 00:28:58,263
The faster we get out of here,

485
00:28:58,297 --> 00:29:00,098
the better chance we have
of not being discovered.

486
00:29:00,132 --> 00:29:03,234
Okay? 'Cause if we don't
do this, we got nothing.

487
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:05,369
If we take this body back now,

488
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,972
all we'll find out
is, "yup, she's dead.

489
00:29:08,006 --> 00:29:10,173
If we take and they killed her."

490
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:11,574
Please.

491
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,110
Do this for me.

492
00:29:31,591 --> 00:29:34,727
You still got the
north entrance, Frost?

493
00:29:34,761 --> 00:29:36,162
Affirmative.

494
00:29:36,196 --> 00:29:37,763
If you want to go sit
in his car, go ahead.

495
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:39,498
Shut up. Excuse me?

496
00:29:39,532 --> 00:29:40,833
Not you.

497
00:29:40,867 --> 00:29:43,035
And if they come,
they're coming at night.

498
00:29:43,069 --> 00:29:45,337
So keep your eyes peeled,
all right? Roger that.

499
00:29:49,274 --> 00:29:50,975
What is the smell?

500
00:29:51,009 --> 00:29:52,343
What smell?

501
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:54,911
You know what smell.
There's an animal in here.

502
00:29:57,014 --> 00:29:59,482
Ugh! Something licked me.
What is it?

503
00:29:59,516 --> 00:30:02,085
Oh, it's just Jo Friday.

504
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:03,219
He's filthy.

505
00:30:03,253 --> 00:30:04,320
"She."

506
00:30:04,816 --> 00:30:05,672
"Joe"?

507
00:30:05,673 --> 00:30:07,089
"Jo," like "Josephine."

508
00:30:07,123 --> 00:30:09,090
Found her by the side of
the road this morning.

509
00:30:12,893 --> 00:30:14,693
Mnh.

510
00:30:14,728 --> 00:30:16,361
Hey, you sneezed.

511
00:30:16,395 --> 00:30:18,529
I told you, I'm allergic.

512
00:30:18,564 --> 00:30:21,098
Korsak, it's either him or me.

513
00:30:23,267 --> 00:30:25,434
What? Please don't.

514
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:29,571
Hey, what about him?

515
00:30:29,605 --> 00:30:31,239
"Her."

516
00:30:31,274 --> 00:30:34,808
She stays. I got to pee.

517
00:30:34,843 --> 00:30:36,810
You've got to be kidding me.

518
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:42,381
Nice...Doggy.

519
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:45,150
My God, what have you been in?

520
00:30:45,185 --> 00:30:46,685
You got to go. You got to go.

521
00:30:59,164 --> 00:31:02,700
Later that same day. Come on!

522
00:31:04,702 --> 00:31:06,168
Korsak?

523
00:31:10,942 --> 00:31:13,578
Hey!

524
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:19,785
Korsak?

525
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:27,991
Korsak! Come on!

526
00:31:52,647 --> 00:31:54,214
Stay down. Stay down!

527
00:31:54,248 --> 00:31:55,815
Stand! Put your hands
on your head now!

528
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,083
Hey, it's me.

529
00:31:57,669 --> 00:31:59,152
What the hell are you doing here?!

530
00:31:59,187 --> 00:32:01,289
I... I was chasing Hoyt.

531
00:32:01,323 --> 00:32:03,156
What do you mean, you
were chasing Hoyt?!

532
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:05,490
How'd u even know he was here?!

533
00:32:05,525 --> 00:32:06,457
Rizzoli.

534
00:32:06,492 --> 00:32:08,091
Korsak? Hello?

535
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:11,797
Little help over here.
Officer down.

536
00:32:12,648 --> 00:32:13,736
Officer down.

537
00:32:13,737 --> 00:32:14,970
Korsak.

538
00:32:15,004 --> 00:32:17,004
Officer... hey, man. Hey.

539
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:17,800
Hey.

540
00:32:17,801 --> 00:32:19,638
Officer down, officer down.

541
00:32:19,673 --> 00:32:20,537
Give me that.

542
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:22,016
Where are you? On the
other side of the creek.

543
00:32:22,017 --> 00:32:23,220
What's your location?

544
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,801
He snuck up on me.

545
00:32:24,802 --> 00:32:25,967
Okay, okay.

546
00:32:26,002 --> 00:32:27,434
You're gonna be fine. Are they coming?

547
00:32:27,435 --> 00:32:29,002
Yes, they're coming. Okay. Okay.

548
00:32:29,036 --> 00:32:31,409
I'm sorry. You're gonna be fine.
You' gonna be fine.

549
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,848
Let's go. Push the
ambulance here, quick.

550
00:32:38,652 --> 00:32:40,093
Guess where I've been.

551
00:32:40,094 --> 00:32:41,876
How's Korsak? Fine.

552
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:44,212
No, he's not fi... he'll be fine.

553
00:32:44,246 --> 00:32:46,314
You told Agent Dean where
we were, didn't you?

554
00:32:46,348 --> 00:32:48,383
I did. Without telling me?

555
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:50,452
I'm sorry. Really? You're sorry?

556
00:32:50,487 --> 00:32:55,023
Because I treated a senior
Federal Agent like a perp.

557
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:57,492
Tackled him, Maura, in a creek.

558
00:32:57,527 --> 00:32:59,527
Well, that's unfortunate.

559
00:32:59,562 --> 00:33:02,765
But there is a fine line
between courage and stupidity.

560
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,466
Yeah, a fine, thin, blue line.

561
00:33:06,604 --> 00:33:07,671
Thank you.

562
00:33:07,705 --> 00:33:09,807
What? You have a turtle.

563
00:33:09,841 --> 00:33:11,441
Tortoise. Whatever.

564
00:33:11,476 --> 00:33:14,910
Well, at least give her a bath.

565
00:33:17,298 --> 00:33:19,867
Did you actually tackle him?

566
00:33:19,868 --> 00:33:23,497
Yes, like a linebacker.
Very professional.

567
00:33:24,124 --> 00:33:26,892
Wow. You're very brave.

568
00:33:26,893 --> 00:33:29,862
No, I'm simply tired
of being afraid.

569
00:33:45,352 --> 00:33:47,119
How did you get past Frost?

570
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,421
He didn't.

571
00:33:49,456 --> 00:33:51,490
Thank you so much.

572
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:58,459
If you're looking
for an apology...

573
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,564
I would know to look elsewhere.

574
00:34:01,102 --> 00:34:04,001
Fine, okay. I'm sorry.

575
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:06,603
Would you like coffee?

576
00:34:06,637 --> 00:34:08,971
Sure. That'd be great.

577
00:34:17,591 --> 00:34:19,090
Your place is really nice.

578
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:20,624
You sound surprised.

579
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:24,777
What, like I live in a
sterile little hovel

580
00:34:24,778 --> 00:34:28,230
with my dead plants
and my tv dinners?

581
00:34:30,933 --> 00:34:33,568
So...

582
00:34:33,603 --> 00:34:35,737
Question.

583
00:34:37,873 --> 00:34:40,174
Why did Hoyt come after you?

584
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:44,843
Hoyt's first victim was mine.

585
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:47,245
And in case you hadn't noticed,

586
00:34:47,279 --> 00:34:51,060
I seem to be Hoyt's
favorite type... female.

587
00:34:52,732 --> 00:34:54,483
Oh, yeah, I noticed.

588
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,391
And what happened to your hands?

589
00:35:02,929 --> 00:35:04,927
Why are you so
interested in this case?

590
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:06,762
That's "need to know."

591
00:35:06,797 --> 00:35:09,131
Seriously? You fed
guys actually say that?

592
00:35:13,136 --> 00:35:15,404
I bet you never even once

593
00:35:15,439 --> 00:35:17,373
considered leaving
the force, did you?

594
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:20,042
Sure, I did...

595
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,345
when Hoyt had me
pinned to the floor

596
00:35:23,379 --> 00:35:25,612
and a scalpel to my throat.

597
00:35:30,218 --> 00:35:31,244
Hey!

598
00:35:37,223 --> 00:35:39,677
And now there are two of them,

599
00:35:39,678 --> 00:35:42,724
hunting me down like
a pack of wolves.

600
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,330
You want me to stay?

601
00:35:49,364 --> 00:35:50,931
Hmm?

602
00:35:52,334 --> 00:35:54,501
No.

603
00:35:54,535 --> 00:35:55,702
No.

604
00:35:57,371 --> 00:36:00,139
I mean, I don't mean no.
I mean no.

605
00:36:00,174 --> 00:36:01,541
Like, no.

606
00:36:01,575 --> 00:36:03,876
Okay. All right.

607
00:36:05,245 --> 00:36:07,479
Well...

608
00:36:07,513 --> 00:36:09,147
Thank you for the coffee.

609
00:36:12,584 --> 00:36:16,052
All right.

610
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,601
Thank you.

611
00:36:21,602 --> 00:36:22,995
Okay.

612
00:36:23,592 --> 00:36:25,893
Good night.

613
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,831
"No"?

614
00:36:42,777 --> 00:36:45,277
God, ma, give it a rest.

615
00:36:45,311 --> 00:36:48,008
Have you been here all day? Yeah.

616
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:50,576
Whoa, good.

617
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:51,711
More caffeine.

618
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:57,545
Mm. Uh, what's my ringtone?

619
00:37:05,953 --> 00:37:09,522
Nice and upbeat.

620
00:37:09,556 --> 00:37:11,591
You should talk to your mom.

621
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:13,226
She's still mad at me

622
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,728
that I won't come home and
sleep in my pink canopy bed.

623
00:37:15,762 --> 00:37:18,430
Mm. I always wanted a pink canopy.

624
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,732
I wanted a horse.

625
00:37:20,766 --> 00:37:22,016
Please don't tell me that

626
00:37:22,017 --> 00:37:24,068
you always wanted to
dissect dead people.

627
00:37:24,103 --> 00:37:26,037
Okay, I won't.

628
00:37:31,308 --> 00:37:32,841
I have to go

629
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,909
to the forensics lab
at Quantico tomorrow.

630
00:37:35,944 --> 00:37:37,710
In the middle of this?

631
00:37:37,744 --> 00:37:40,646
It's connected to this.

632
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,949
Right. Yeah, here we go again.

633
00:37:43,983 --> 00:37:46,952
Why are you part of the
"need to know" loop and I...

634
00:37:46,986 --> 00:37:48,928
he's trying to kill me.

635
00:37:48,929 --> 00:37:52,189
Jane, this ca-
this case is a lot bigger

636
00:37:52,224 --> 00:37:55,626
and it's far more
complicated than we thought.

637
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,991
I want to tell you.
Great. Fill me in.

638
00:37:57,992 --> 00:38:01,631
I've been ordered not to.
It involves national security.

639
00:38:01,665 --> 00:38:02,932
Are you kidding me?

640
00:38:05,302 --> 00:38:07,770
Jane. Jane!

641
00:38:07,804 --> 00:38:09,377
Jane, where are you going?

642
00:38:09,813 --> 00:38:13,008
I'm sorry. Am I being a
little too loud for you?

643
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:15,110
Do you ever relax?

644
00:38:15,144 --> 00:38:17,645
No, I don't ever relax!
And you know what else?

645
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:20,814
I've had it up to here with
your "need to know" bullshit.

646
00:38:21,794 --> 00:38:23,862
I've heard "bullshit" before.

647
00:38:23,896 --> 00:38:25,263
Senator Sam conway,

648
00:38:25,297 --> 00:38:27,431
chairman of the armed
services committee.

649
00:38:27,466 --> 00:38:29,466
Detective Rizzoli.

650
00:38:31,535 --> 00:38:33,202
Sit down.

651
00:38:37,906 --> 00:38:39,974
Where is this?

652
00:38:40,008 --> 00:38:41,776
Kabul, Afghanistan.

653
00:38:43,178 --> 00:38:44,709
It looks like Hoyt's work.

654
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:48,381
A war zone is a serial
killer's paradise.

655
00:38:48,415 --> 00:38:49,648
Our apprentice is a soldier?

656
00:38:49,683 --> 00:38:51,932
When we first started
investigating these killings,

657
00:38:51,933 --> 00:38:53,284
they looked like war crimes.

658
00:38:53,318 --> 00:38:55,682
So you withheld
crucial information

659
00:38:55,683 --> 00:38:58,174
so you could watch the dumb
Boston cops run around in circles?

660
00:38:58,175 --> 00:38:59,521
You can blame me for that.

661
00:38:59,556 --> 00:39:01,689
This is a very sensitive
investigation.

662
00:39:01,724 --> 00:39:04,625
We believe the apprentice
finished his tours,

663
00:39:04,659 --> 00:39:06,993
came to Boston to find Hoyt.

664
00:39:07,028 --> 00:39:08,327
So they could kill together.

665
00:39:08,362 --> 00:39:10,262
That's what it looks like.

666
00:39:10,297 --> 00:39:13,732
Wait. Wait, no.

667
00:39:13,766 --> 00:39:15,625
If our apprentice was a soldier,

668
00:39:15,626 --> 00:39:18,803
we would've gotten a hit on
his fingerprints or his DNA

669
00:39:18,837 --> 00:39:20,037
in the military database.

670
00:39:20,072 --> 00:39:21,806
We didn't get a hit.

671
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,975
You ever heard of
sheep dipping? No.

672
00:39:25,009 --> 00:39:27,210
It's when the CIA
borrows a soldier

673
00:39:27,244 --> 00:39:28,845
for a black-ops mission.

674
00:39:28,879 --> 00:39:30,379
Green berets were heep-dipped.

675
00:39:30,414 --> 00:39:32,473
Their identities were
wiped from all databases

676
00:39:32,474 --> 00:39:35,485
so they wouldn't be recognized
as American military.

677
00:39:37,289 --> 00:39:38,790
So you think our apprentice

678
00:39:39,449 --> 00:39:41,091
was a green beret
working for the CIA?

679
00:39:41,126 --> 00:39:43,494
Yes.

680
00:39:46,997 --> 00:39:48,797
So we train our best
men to be killers,

681
00:39:48,832 --> 00:39:50,732
and then we're surprised
when they are.

682
00:39:50,767 --> 00:39:53,034
I hate that he's a soldier.

683
00:39:56,411 --> 00:39:58,362
No, that's it.

684
00:39:58,891 --> 00:40:00,897
That's the connection. What?

685
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,341
You wouldn't know it 'cause
it wasn't in the file.

686
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:04,710
Hoyt used an assumed
name to get into

687
00:40:04,744 --> 00:40:07,311
a combat medic training
program at Fort Stewart.

688
00:40:07,346 --> 00:40:09,580
That has to be where
they met, right?

689
00:40:10,155 --> 00:40:11,623
Yeah, that's worth a shot.

690
00:40:11,624 --> 00:40:13,067
Let's fly to Fort Stewart in the morning.

691
00:40:13,068 --> 00:40:14,644
And... and cross-reference
Hoyt's records.

692
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:16,473
We'll nail both these
sons of bitches.

693
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:25,614
Uh, did you eat dinner?

694
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,251
I can't remember.

695
00:40:29,988 --> 00:40:34,121
Well, are you hungry... for food?

696
00:40:35,978 --> 00:40:37,431
Agent Dean?

697
00:40:38,112 --> 00:40:39,312
Excuse me.

698
00:40:39,346 --> 00:40:40,913
Yeah.

699
00:40:48,558 --> 00:40:49,827
What is it, Maura?

700
00:40:49,861 --> 00:40:51,695
Jane...

701
00:40:51,729 --> 00:40:54,097
I'm in your apartment.

702
00:40:54,098 --> 00:40:54,585
Why?

703
00:40:56,883 --> 00:40:58,092
I'll be right there.

704
00:41:19,763 --> 00:41:20,929
Yeah?

705
00:41:20,964 --> 00:41:22,364
Jane, you were right.

706
00:41:22,398 --> 00:41:23,399
Called in a favor,

707
00:41:23,433 --> 00:41:25,534
got some records
from Fort Stewart.

708
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:29,272
Our apprentice is special
forces officer John Stark, 32.

709
00:41:29,306 --> 00:41:30,940
He did three tours in Afghanistan

710
00:41:30,974 --> 00:41:32,608
as part of a direct action force.

711
00:41:32,642 --> 00:41:34,909
What unit was he assigned to?

712
00:41:34,944 --> 00:41:37,478
618, medical care specialists.

713
00:41:37,512 --> 00:41:40,380
Oh, my God, that's
the same as Hoyt.

714
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,381
Stark lives at 400 Chestnut Hill Square.

715
00:41:42,415 --> 00:41:43,782
I'm already sending units.

716
00:41:43,817 --> 00:41:46,652
Okay. Uh, I'll get
there as soon as I can.

717
00:41:46,686 --> 00:41:48,120
Detective Rizzoli. Yeah.

718
00:41:48,154 --> 00:41:50,722
Dr. Isles asked if
you'd I.D. the body.

719
00:41:50,757 --> 00:41:52,090
What body?

720
00:41:52,124 --> 00:41:53,558
Sorry, thought you knew.

721
00:41:53,592 --> 00:41:55,060
Dr. Isles said it
was your neighbor...

722
00:41:55,094 --> 00:41:57,430
young female, 20s.

723
00:41:57,464 --> 00:41:59,331
Marisa?

724
00:41:59,366 --> 00:42:02,133
Oh, God, no.

725
00:42:02,168 --> 00:42:04,602
No, come on. No, no.

726
00:42:08,573 --> 00:42:10,941
Hello, Jane.

727
00:42:14,078 --> 00:42:15,645
So nice to see you.

728
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:47,271
You looking for this?

729
00:42:49,073 --> 00:42:53,276
You know, your problem...

730
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:56,880
Is that your heart...

731
00:42:56,914 --> 00:42:59,882
Rules your head.

732
00:43:10,592 --> 00:43:12,159
Where's your little helper?

733
00:43:12,193 --> 00:43:14,628
He's getting ready
for our final game.

734
00:43:14,662 --> 00:43:18,831
And I'm so happy to finish...

735
00:43:18,866 --> 00:43:20,933
What we started.

736
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,640
Come take a look.

737
00:44:19,779 --> 00:44:23,214
Oh, Jane.

738
00:44:24,516 --> 00:44:28,285
Did you miss me?

739
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:33,823
What the...

740
00:44:34,992 --> 00:44:36,425
Mnh! Ugh!

741
00:44:57,681 --> 00:44:59,381
Dr. Hoyt?

742
00:45:02,586 --> 00:45:05,989
Come on. Charge.

743
00:45:06,023 --> 00:45:06,991
Charge.

744
00:45:07,025 --> 00:45:08,526
Dr. Hoyt?

745
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,728
Dr. Hoyt?

746
00:45:15,667 --> 00:45:17,234
Dr. Hoyt.

747
00:45:17,269 --> 00:45:18,736
Ugh!

748
00:46:28,696 --> 00:46:29,962
We match.

749
00:46:59,777 --> 00:47:01,408
Hey.

750
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,246
Heard you got second-degree burns.

751
00:47:09,281 --> 00:47:11,682
Yeah, flares are h-hot.

752
00:47:18,422 --> 00:47:21,691
Stark was a decorated soldier.

753
00:47:21,725 --> 00:47:25,328
Makes me sick.

754
00:47:28,465 --> 00:47:31,402
Hoyt kills three people

755
00:47:31,436 --> 00:47:35,605
so Stark can waltz in and
hide him in a body bag.

756
00:47:40,944 --> 00:47:43,045
You got to be hungry now.

757
00:47:45,648 --> 00:47:47,315
So...

758
00:47:52,421 --> 00:47:54,755
I just want to go home.

759
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:56,123
Yeah.

760
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,893
Okay.

761
00:48:02,697 --> 00:48:04,698
I'll see ya. Yeah.

762
00:48:10,139 --> 00:48:12,040
Thank you, though.

763
00:48:14,643 --> 00:48:15,876
Sure.

764
00:48:51,106 --> 00:48:52,139
Hey.

765
00:48:52,173 --> 00:48:53,373
Hey.

766
00:48:53,408 --> 00:48:56,743
I wanted you to see for yourself

767
00:48:56,777 --> 00:48:59,378
what extraordinary
creatures these are.

768
00:48:59,413 --> 00:49:02,180
Uh...Thanks.

769
00:49:02,214 --> 00:49:04,581
I thought you might need
some help cleaning up.

770
00:49:04,616 --> 00:49:08,383
Yeah.

771
00:49:12,721 --> 00:49:15,589
All right, um...

772
00:49:15,623 --> 00:49:18,524
Let me get you some work clothes.

773
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,192
These are my work clothes.

774
00:49:22,928 --> 00:49:25,529
What? You don't like?

775
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:30,465
Well, they are kind of
cute when they're small.

776
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,333
I told you.

777
00:49:32,368 --> 00:49:35,703
So, where do you want me to start?

778
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:41,974
Come on.

779
00:49:42,008 --> 00:49:44,876
What? Let's go get a bloody Mary.

780
00:49:44,911 --> 00:49:46,745
We always said that we
need to do something

781
00:49:46,779 --> 00:49:49,079
outside of a crime scene.

782
00:49:49,114 --> 00:49:51,247
This is a crime scene.

783
00:49:51,282 --> 00:49:53,250
Let's go.

784
00:49:53,285 --> 00:49:55,286
Great.

785
00:49:58,757 --> 00:50:00,790
Uh, but...

786
00:50:00,824 --> 00:50:02,557
Dressed like that?

787
00:50:02,591 --> 00:50:05,256
These are my going-out clothes.

788
00:50:10,623 --> 00:50:12,823
Come on.

789
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:17,128
Keep going. Go on, go on.

1
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,120
So this is how it is.
You're the brain behind Blue Blood.

2
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,880
- Enzo doesn't need my brain.
- But he does need your drugs.

3
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,640
We are the founders of the Camorra.

4
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,400
And then someone from Secondigliano

5
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,560
wants to steal our place?

6
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,880
First, I'm no longer
someone from Secondigliano.

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,240
Second, we've already
taken all your places.

8
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,640
If you're no longer from
Secondigliano, who are you then?

9
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,720
Someone who wants to do business
with justice.

10
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,320
What justice do you mean?

11
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,960
You took away Santo's business.

12
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,600
If you don't want any more bodies,
give Blue Blood back his place.

13
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,360
We didn't steal anything.
Santo went to the police.

14
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,880
We cannot support his family,
everybody knows them.

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,960
But you also have turncoats
at home now, right?

16
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,120
So those stupid rules no longer apply.

17
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,120
And what happens if everything goes
like you're saying now?

18
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,640
Then you accept that Blue Blood
is entitled to this, and you aren't.

19
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,200
Translated by: NederSubs

20
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,760
You swore to me
that asshole didn't exist to you anymore.

21
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,120
He doesn't, Dad. You know that.

22
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,400
That's what I thought.

23
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,880
Because you gave me that impression.

24
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,000
But now I know that's not true.

25
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,400
His father is dead.
The sooner he realizes that,

26
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,640
the better it is for everyone.

27
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,480
But Dad, it's not like you think.

28
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,400
- Sweetheart.
- Gennaro.

29
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,760
- How are you?
- Not good.

30
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,600
He knows everything.

31
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,040
- Are you sure?
- Yes, very sure.

32
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,400
Tell me.

33
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,280
The other day, you said he was a problem
that needed to be resolved.

34
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,880
Resolve it quickly.

35
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,680
The Wizard said yes.

36
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,120
This is a drop in the ocean.

37
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,320
If you want to see your son grow up,
you have to act smart.

38
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,040
To achieve what you want to achieve,
time is needed.

39
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,880
Time is not a problem for you.
For me it is.

40
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,960
I'm ready to share all of Maddalena
with you.

41
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,280
But you have to give him Forcella.

42
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,320
Ruggero.

43
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
We have no choice, Edoardo.

44
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,720
We either give in or wage war.

45
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,240
And a real war will cost us a lot more.

46
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,520
Forcella is ours.

47
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,640
With all due respect,
Ciro pushed us into the System.

48
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:23,200
- And? Is that so bad?
- We've always hated the System.

49
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,520
I'm not that arrogant.
I think the System is a good thing.

50
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,040
This is all thanks to Ciro. He taught us
everything and gave us weapons.

51
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,920
Do you realize that?

52
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,280
I gave him my word.

53
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,920
We wanted our neighborhood back
and now we're going to claim it.

54
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,080
Take this one, and stay sharp.

55
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,200
And the last one. Have a nice day.

56
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,920
Are we going downstairs, to Uncle Enzo?

57
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,600
Why would you?
You can see everything from here.

58
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,320
- Yes, but...
- Blue Blood.

59
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,400
- I'll be right there.
- Hurry up, okay?

60
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,880
- Hi, Carmela.
- Hi.

61
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,760
You did it.

62
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,600
You've taken everything
what Dad couldn't get.

63
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,640
Now the whole neighborhood loves you,
did you see that?

64
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,720
But nobody is untouchable.

65
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,400
And now, you have to be
even more aware of that.

66
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,960
- What do you mean?
- You think you're Santo now.

67
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,640
But the world has changed.

68
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,160
In the past, you showed respect
and kept your word.

69
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,480
But now everyone betrays each other,
even your brother can rat you out.

70
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,720
- That's not how my friends are.
- No, but you have to stay alert.

71
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,120
Are you on my side?

72
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,320
I am on your side.
But you have to promise me one thing.

73
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,400
Keep Cosimino out of it.

74
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:08,920
The first one who puts him
onto the streets, I'll kill them.

75
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,080
Good night, Blue Blood.

76
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,640
Are you coming with me?

77
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,600
Then we buy new shoes for you.

78
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,040
- What's the matter?
- All the boys are allowed to help.

79
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,200
But not me. They all say
that my uncle says I can't.

80
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,480
In this life,
you either end up dead or in jail.

81
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,720
I'm like my uncle, I'm not afraid to die.

82
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,280
Listen carefully.

83
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:40,920
Dying sucks. You'll start to shake,
you can't breathe, you'll piss yourself.

84
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,400
Besides, it's a waste.

85
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,280
You're proud of him now.
I want you to be proud of me too.

86
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,640
He did this to take back what was ours.

87
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,200
And he did it for you.

88
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:58,400
So that you can get out of here
and live a life different than ours.

89
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,400
Then, your uncle and I
will be real proud of you.

90
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,960
Are you coming now?

91
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,880
Fine.
Behave yourself, I'll see you in a bit.

92
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,840
And make sure your phone is on.

93
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,600
- Hello, can I try this on?
- Yes, the fitting rooms are on the right.

94
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,240
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, what are you doing here?

95
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,640
Let's go.

96
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,360
Wait a minute, guys.

97
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,280
- Hello, how are you?
- What is it?

98
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,320
- Are you still at home? Done your homework?
- Yes.

99
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,680
Do you want to see the dress
I bought for that dinner at your uncle's?

100
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,600
- I'll send you a picture.
- Hurry up.

101
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,200
Where are you now?

102
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,920
What's the matter? What happened?

103
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,640
Is everything okay?

104
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,360
Hello Bell'e Buon.

105
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,880
What?

106
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:38,200
The others are behind you,
but responding now is suicide, they say.

107
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,760
Do you think so, too?

108
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,400
What are you going to do?

109
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,240
I'll stay with you,
even if it will kill me.

110
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,640
Peace is over.

111
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:26,400
I can only tell you that the order
didn't come from me, nor from my allies.

112
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,680
We're looking for the person responsible,
but that will take time.

113
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,880
We don't have time.

114
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,240
I give you my word. I'll find out
who it was and bring them to you.

115
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,840
It wasn't easy to persuade my allies
to give you Forcella.

116
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:50,400
They're angry now. And if Blue Blood
does something, I won't stop them.

117
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,880
Think about it and make a decision.

118
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:26,000
Do you really think that monkey
will try its best to stop Blue Blood?

119
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,160
Ciro di Marzio is anything but a monkey.

120
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,600
I'm okay with everything, you know that.
You're in charge.

121
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,400
But I do have a question for you:

122
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,680
If it weren't us...

123
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,360
who was it then?

124
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,120
I'm really sorry for you.

125
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:28,760
I already talked to them. As soon as they
find the culprit, they bring them to us.

126
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,520
- It was that asshole Charming.
- We can't know that.

127
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,400
The Wizard says
they only need some time.

128
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,920
We wiped them out.
Think about it...

129
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,960
Who's chased out of Forcella
due to our agreement?

130
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,920
And who will come back
if that agreement is terminated again?

131
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,400
You're poisoned inside,
I understand that.

132
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:07,840
But before you do anything,
you have to think.

133
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,200
Nobody has to tell me what to do.
I already know that.

134
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,840
Manuela wants to tell you
something important.

135
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,800
Tell him.

136
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,160
The daughter of a friend
is a schoolmate of Charming's niece.

137
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,040
She says they're celebrating the communion
on Saturday, in Marechiaro.

138
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,080
- No, I didn't do it for the money.
- This is for Carmela's smile.

139
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:53,000
Your sister was an angel.
She's asking for justice from heaven.

140
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,400
I already talked to the Wizard.

141
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,480
He says the Federation
is not behind this.

142
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,000
I believe him.

143
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,480
Otherwise they would never have
pulled back their boys from Forcella.

144
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,520
In addition, they would never
hurt Carmela. They knew it.

145
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,880
That was the only thing
Enzo would flip out about.

146
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,120
It was you.

147
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,240
What did you say, again? You didn't
trust yourself, but you trusted me.

148
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,080
You killed the sister of our ally,
that wasn't the deal.

149
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,160
You should've talked to me, and I should've
talked to Enzo. Why didn't you do that?

150
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:21,000
That time is over,
now I have to regain my family.

151
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,000
Who's your brother, me or Enzo?

152
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,200
I want to know whose side you're on.

153
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:41,240
I've already made my choice.

154
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,480
I will not change my mind.

155
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,600
Enzo thinks Charming is behind it.

156
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,960
And he can keep thinking that.

157
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,120
They're coming.

158
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,960
It's crawling with armed men.

159
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,160
- Will this stay between us?
- You know me.

160
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,680
Don't you dare.

161
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,760
Quick.

162
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,600
You fucked up real bad.

163
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,200
I don't want to talk about that now.

164
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,640
What do you mean,
do I need to keep my mouth shut?

165
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,760
If someone has to keep their mouth shut,
it's you. Shut the fuck up.

166
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,320
You think you're tough or what?

167
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:10,080
I've seen what you're capable of.
You better back off.

168
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,240
If you want to do something again,
you ask me for permission.

169
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,160
Wait for him here.

170
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,480
- Search him, make sure you find him.
- Will do.

171
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,400
Who's there?

172
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,320
- A woman wants to speak to you.
- Who is it?

173
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,840
I don't know her,
but she's alone and unarmed.

174
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,040
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

175
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,040
Wait here, don't worry.

176
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,680
- Good evening. Have a seat.
- Thank you.

177
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,320
Now that I see you in person,
I get why they call you Charming.

178
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,360
Compliments from beautiful women
are always nice.

179
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,120
Although I think it's a shame
that I don't know who you are.

180
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,280
Annalisa Magliocca,
but my name is not important.

181
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,160
This is about the name
of the asshole behind Blue Blood.

182
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,800
Do you mean Ciro di Marzio?

183
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,400
I mean Genny Savastano.

184
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,800
You could have killed him,
but you didn't.

185
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:31,520
And now he's back firmly on his feet,
thinking about how he can screw you over.

186
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:38,560
That's why I'm here. I thought
this information might be important.

187
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,320
Did I think that correctly?

188
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,160
If yes, this can be the beginning
of a great friendship.

189
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,240
And as you know,
my friends are close to my heart.

190
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,200
I was hoping to hear that.

191
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,160
- May I go, Don Edoardo?
- Sure, go.

192
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,040
It's me, I want to see you.

193
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,640
Do you have it?

194
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,200
Then we'll go.

195
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,440
NEXT TIME

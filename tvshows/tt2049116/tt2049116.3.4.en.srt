1
00:00:43,213 --> 00:00:47,493
I'll ask you a few questions,
for clarification.

2
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:51,693
I want to remind you
that you are under oath.

3
00:00:51,813 --> 00:00:57,973
You have sworn to speak the truth
and not withhold any information.

4
00:00:58,093 --> 00:01:00,493
Like the DA just asked you:

5
00:01:00,613 --> 00:01:03,413
On June 15, 2016...

6
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:08,253
you stated that the suspect
present here, Annalisa Magliocca...

7
00:01:08,373 --> 00:01:12,533
was responsible for the death
of Mario Cantapane.

8
00:01:12,653 --> 00:01:15,413
According to you, the motive
for that murder was...

9
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:21,653
the extramarital relationship you had
with the victim. Can you confirm this?

10
00:01:21,773 --> 00:01:23,813
I never said that.

11
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:26,053
Could you please speak up a bit?

12
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:29,533
I never said that.

13
00:01:29,653 --> 00:01:32,653
We have a signed statement from you.

14
00:01:41,093 --> 00:01:43,173
Do you recognize your signature?

15
00:01:46,293 --> 00:01:47,693
That's mine.

16
00:01:47,813 --> 00:01:49,453
I couldn't hear that.

17
00:01:49,573 --> 00:01:51,293
That's mine.

18
00:01:51,413 --> 00:01:54,773
Why did you sign something
you didn't say?

19
00:01:54,893 --> 00:01:56,853
I didn't read the statement.

20
00:01:56,973 --> 00:02:00,733
So the police altered your statement...

21
00:02:00,853 --> 00:02:03,133
or: what it says here is not true?

22
00:02:14,693 --> 00:02:16,853
No, your Honor, it's not true.

23
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:43,133
- I have to go to the toilet.
- Go ahead.

24
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:08,573
The other half, as promised.

25
00:03:14,853 --> 00:03:20,253
This place is crawling with cops, but are
you sure that I can go outside safely now?

26
00:03:20,373 --> 00:03:22,173
I swear it.

27
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,373
Where are you going?

28
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:36,373
It doesn't matter where I go.
I need to get far away from here.

29
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:40,533
Don't forget your promise.

Translated by: NederSubs

31
00:04:22,373 --> 00:04:23,773
Hi Gennaro.

32
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:26,373
Hi Gegè.

33
00:04:26,493 --> 00:04:28,773
So, what did you want to tell me?

34
00:04:35,653 --> 00:04:40,373
- My dad gave you that watch, right?
- Yes, for my graduation.

35
00:04:42,253 --> 00:04:46,493
- All Savastanos had one.
- I never took it off.

36
00:04:46,613 --> 00:04:49,813
That way I feel like I belong to a family.

37
00:04:51,853 --> 00:04:55,653
Only an orphan thinks
that family is a good thing.

38
00:05:05,173 --> 00:05:09,333
There is news from a friend of mine,
I wanted to tell you.

39
00:05:09,453 --> 00:05:13,453
- Has the shipment arrived?
- Tomorrow morning at seven o'clock.

40
00:05:14,893 --> 00:05:18,813
Arrange a berth for a 20-meter ship,
in Cala Galera.

41
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:20,333
Consider it done.

42
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:25,613
The ship is called Esperanza,
it sails under the Panamanian flag.

43
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:28,453
I'll take care of it.
What about the payment?

44
00:05:28,573 --> 00:05:31,533
Cash. I need money to wage war.

45
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,813
Who's buying buys outside of the System?

46
00:05:53,893 --> 00:05:56,053
Tomorrow morning, at the pier...

47
00:05:57,213 --> 00:06:00,933
I want to find a bottle of champagne.
Chilled.

48
00:06:26,173 --> 00:06:29,013
- Is this piece of junk yours?
- Yes.

49
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:32,293
We're going to change that.
I'll buy you a new one.

50
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:38,133
- Don't you worry.
- I do worry. Do you know why?

51
00:06:38,253 --> 00:06:41,093
I don't want to get tetanus
in your car.

52
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:47,093
Tell that asshole Gennaro Savastano
that I want to see him immediately.

53
00:06:47,213 --> 00:06:50,093
Fire up this limousine
and bring me home.

54
00:06:56,453 --> 00:06:57,973
Thank you for coming here again.

55
00:07:13,693 --> 00:07:16,853
Ever since you're back,
he's been practicing to walk.

56
00:07:16,973 --> 00:07:20,493
Although he seems drunk,
because he doesn't walk straight.

57
00:07:20,613 --> 00:07:23,533
Did you hear that?
She called you a drunk.

58
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:26,133
Hand him over to me,
I want to try something.

59
00:07:27,173 --> 00:07:29,253
Come here, you handsome.

60
00:07:29,373 --> 00:07:33,013
Come on, handsome grandson.
Let's see.

61
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:35,333
- What are you doing?
- He loves wine.

62
00:07:36,573 --> 00:07:38,653
- What does it matter?
- It's unhealthy.

63
00:07:38,773 --> 00:07:43,413
- Why? I raised you with it.
- Stop it.

64
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:45,413
He'll sleep very well.

65
00:07:58,453 --> 00:08:00,053
Hello, tell me.

66
00:08:08,813 --> 00:08:11,853
- Is that bitch out already?
- She wants to see you now.

67
00:08:11,973 --> 00:08:15,613
- What does she want?
- Your agreement is no longer valid.

68
00:08:16,693 --> 00:08:21,333
- She's gone crazy, she wants war.
- She, alone, versus me?

69
00:08:21,453 --> 00:08:24,933
She says she'll get everyone to join her
if she wants to.

70
00:08:25,053 --> 00:08:28,893
Always with that phone,
we can't even eat quietly for once.

71
00:08:29,013 --> 00:08:31,133
Your husband is a real businessman.

72
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:37,413
Tell that whore
that I'll be there tonight.

73
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:41,213
But not on her property,
I don't want any hassle.

74
00:08:46,013 --> 00:08:47,693
Wave at your father.

75
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,453
- Do you really have to go to Naples?
- What can I do?

76
00:09:12,773 --> 00:09:16,213
Naples train station

77
00:10:13,293 --> 00:10:16,053
- A cup of coffee.
- One coffee at the bar.

78
00:10:21,093 --> 00:10:22,533
Here you go.

79
00:10:31,893 --> 00:10:36,013
- Tomorrow at 7 am you'll leave with Pietro.
- Where to?

80
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:38,893
- To here.
- And you?

81
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,933
Don't worry,
I'll come as soon as I'm done.

82
00:10:55,773 --> 00:10:57,893
Your father has become a problem.

83
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:02,453
And I have to solve that problem.

84
00:11:07,453 --> 00:11:09,093
Come back soon.

85
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,653
Say goodbye to daddy.

86
00:11:25,453 --> 00:11:27,693
Yes, the ship is called Esperanza.

87
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,133
Exactly.
20 meters, tomorrow around 7:00 am.

88
00:11:34,893 --> 00:11:37,133
So the berth is arranged?

89
00:11:39,013 --> 00:11:40,653
Perfect, thanks.

90
00:11:42,093 --> 00:11:46,373
- How much stuff is there on board?
- 100 kilos, around five million.

91
00:11:46,493 --> 00:11:47,933
And our agreement?

92
00:11:48,053 --> 00:11:53,053
- It's hard. I can't get to his companies.
- What the fuck are you saying?

93
00:11:53,173 --> 00:11:57,053
You set up those companies
to channel my money away.

94
00:11:59,293 --> 00:12:01,093
Yes, I set them up.

95
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:06,293
That is why they're unassailable.

96
00:12:09,413 --> 00:12:14,333
I'd never want
that because of those fucking companies...

97
00:12:14,453 --> 00:12:19,133
the people you love the most
get seriously hurt.

98
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:24,893
I'll make sure it's okay.

99
00:12:25,013 --> 00:12:27,093
That's the spirit.

100
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:31,013
We'll wait for that ship...

101
00:12:32,093 --> 00:12:35,293
and then it's over
for that asshole Gennaro.

102
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:38,653
And then you'll come working for me.

103
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:32,333
What's up, Bomba?

104
00:13:33,973 --> 00:13:37,333
She probably still wants to kill us,
because of her son.

105
00:13:37,453 --> 00:13:39,933
And we haven't forgotten about Track.

106
00:13:43,853 --> 00:13:46,573
Memory is important...

107
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:51,693
but don't forget what shape we were in
last year, after the war.

108
00:13:51,813 --> 00:13:56,053
If we're going to wage war again,
we'll all get killed.

109
00:13:56,173 --> 00:13:59,773
I know that, but I can't help it.

110
00:13:59,893 --> 00:14:02,133
I can still see his face.

111
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:06,093
I understand, Bomba...

112
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:09,973
but he's looking at you now and saying:
Think carefully about what you'll do.

113
00:14:32,053 --> 00:14:34,413
Hi Gennaro. Weapons?

114
00:14:54,253 --> 00:15:00,173
- Annalisa. I'm happy you're free.
- I doubt that, Gennarino.

115
00:15:00,293 --> 00:15:03,453
- I thought it smelled like sewer...
- Ugly whore.

116
00:15:08,053 --> 00:15:11,293
We can better keep the dead
in the cemetery...

117
00:15:11,413 --> 00:15:13,933
otherwise we'll also end up there.

118
00:15:14,053 --> 00:15:17,733
And where do we end up
if we follow you?

119
00:15:17,853 --> 00:15:19,933
I lost a son.

120
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:23,533
And now you think I'll be your maid?

121
00:15:23,653 --> 00:15:25,853
I shit on your money.

122
00:15:27,453 --> 00:15:29,413
It was convenient for you
when you were in jail.

123
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:32,613
In there,
even shit looks like chocolate.

124
00:15:35,413 --> 00:15:37,373
Tell me, what do you want?

125
00:15:38,493 --> 00:15:40,173
Independence.

126
00:15:42,813 --> 00:15:44,533
Is that what you want?

127
00:15:45,853 --> 00:15:47,933
Yes, and do you know why?

128
00:15:48,053 --> 00:15:51,053
The only thing you can give me now,
is trouble.

129
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:55,173
That is not true.

130
00:15:55,293 --> 00:15:58,693
I can still give you the only thing
you need:

131
00:15:58,813 --> 00:16:01,373
The best coke in the world.

132
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,253
Or can't I?

133
00:16:03,373 --> 00:16:07,013
You are the only one in the Alliance
that I respect.

134
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,973
Do you know why?

135
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:12,573
Because you've earned it
with your own blood.

136
00:16:12,693 --> 00:16:15,013
That's why
I want to treat you differently.

137
00:16:17,293 --> 00:16:18,813
How do you mean?

138
00:16:22,093 --> 00:16:27,253
I let you keep your neighborhood and you
do what you want, if you give me a cut.

139
00:16:32,173 --> 00:16:34,093
- How much?
- 30 percent.

140
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:37,693
Think about it.

141
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:42,373
- I will think about it.
- Great.

142
00:16:45,013 --> 00:16:47,533
Ciro Di Marzio...
do you know anything about him?

143
00:20:01,253 --> 00:20:03,253
Look at this.

144
00:20:03,373 --> 00:20:06,133
I can no longer look at that ugly hair.

145
00:20:06,253 --> 00:20:09,653
Don't worry,
I'll make you beautiful again.

146
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:11,213
Just hurry up.

147
00:20:13,773 --> 00:20:16,133
So, what do you think?

148
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,373
What shall I say to Gennaro?

149
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:22,253
That 30 percent is too much.

150
00:20:23,253 --> 00:20:25,653
I think 25 percent is also feasible.

151
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:29,413
So I should accept it?

152
00:20:31,173 --> 00:20:35,733
For the time being. You need to
become stronger, and then we'll see.

153
00:20:36,813 --> 00:20:40,613
But how do we become stronger
when I'm still under Gennaro?

154
00:20:42,053 --> 00:20:45,333
You have to overcharge him.

155
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:50,093
First you are at 25 percent,
otherwise the deal is off.

156
00:20:50,213 --> 00:20:52,333
And then you give him only 20 percent.

157
00:20:55,413 --> 00:20:58,973
How would he ever find out?
He's always in Rome.

158
00:20:59,973 --> 00:21:02,013
Besides, he trusts me.

159
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:04,733
You're a really smart girl.

160
00:21:04,853 --> 00:21:08,253
You should have married my Lello...

161
00:21:08,373 --> 00:21:10,893
not that ugly slut Marinella.

162
00:21:12,373 --> 00:21:15,813
You can't choose your family,
but you can choose your friends.

163
00:21:26,613 --> 00:21:29,413
we have been together for so long

164
00:21:29,533 --> 00:21:32,213
we will never part

165
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,053
we are the children of Vesuvius

166
00:21:35,173 --> 00:21:37,613
one day it will erupt

167
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:40,493
you and I, our whole life together

168
00:21:40,613 --> 00:21:43,173
I cannot live without you

169
00:21:43,293 --> 00:21:45,973
when I'm dead,
I'll watch you from heaven

170
00:21:46,093 --> 00:21:48,733
sing a nice song at my funeral

171
00:21:51,813 --> 00:21:55,653
Turn that shit down.
It bothers the others.

172
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,653
Carmela, we are having fun.

173
00:21:57,773 --> 00:22:01,213
Let Maria go,
she is working for me now.

174
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,653
Don't be boring.

175
00:22:03,773 --> 00:22:06,213
Look at that.

176
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,053
Where have you been?

177
00:22:08,173 --> 00:22:11,093
If it were up to you,
I would come only tomorrow.

178
00:22:11,213 --> 00:22:13,853
- Cantonese has been arrested.
- By the police?

179
00:22:13,973 --> 00:22:15,853
For that hassle at the stadium.

180
00:22:15,973 --> 00:22:20,013
- It's nothing, he'll be out tomorrow.
- We're going to get him now.

181
00:22:24,293 --> 00:22:25,733
Fire 'em up.

182
00:23:56,933 --> 00:23:58,413
How did you find me?

183
00:23:59,533 --> 00:24:02,693
Everyone knows
where the grandson of Santo lives.

184
00:24:05,933 --> 00:24:07,573
What can I do for you?

185
00:24:09,253 --> 00:24:13,853
I have five kilos of that stuff
that you didn't buy in Bulgaria.

186
00:24:16,013 --> 00:24:17,413
Interested?

187
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:23,573
Certainly.

188
00:24:34,213 --> 00:24:36,533
Will you come back tomorrow
for the money?

189
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:41,053
If it's real this time.

190
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,470
That ugly bitch Cianel...

191
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,310
I know her like the back of my hand now.

192
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,870
The point is that she said yes.

193
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,830
That's one less thing to worry about.

194
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,590
I heard that my brother found work.

195
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,550
Thank you.

196
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,390
Hey guys.

197
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,510
Come, we're going to sea.

198
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:25,630
Yes, the ship has arrived.
No, I don't think Gennaro is here.

199
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,390
What do we do now?

200
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,910
Okay.

201
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,190
- What is this?
- Go inside.

202
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,390
- Who are you?
- Move it.

203
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,150
- What do you want?
- Go inside.

204
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,630
- Tell me, where is the stuff?
- What stuff?

205
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,710
You're wasting my time.

206
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:21,070
- There's nothing here, this is a mistake.
- There's nothing here.

207
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:23,190
- See?
- Come with me.

208
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:27,470
What the fuck do you mean,
it isn't here?

209
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,950
Fuck you.

210
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,750
Motherfucker.

211
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,710
My family has nothing left,
except for this shithole.

212
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,350
They didn't let us keep anything.

213
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,270
They took everything from us.

214
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,430
But one day we'll be back,
bigger than ever.

215
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:39,470
This is the first down payment, 20,000.
Count it.

216
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,590
Not necessary.

217
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,190
Wait. Where are you going?

218
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:53,550
I have to tell you something
about my family.

219
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:59,630
Do you know how Santo
started smuggling?

220
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:02,230
He was homeless and was starving.

221
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:06,190
One day he stole an American's car...

222
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,270
and there was $30,000 in it.

223
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,110
Lucky him.

224
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:16,790
His mate Stregone was with him,
he was also just very little.

225
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:19,990
He came up with the idea
of smuggling cigarettes.

226
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:23,110
And so the empire began.

227
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,030
What are you saying?

228
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,950
There are two things that matter
in this world:

229
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:35,470
Happiness and friends.

230
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:45,110
Good times are over, Enzo.
The world has changed.

231
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:48,430
Fine, but we could use your brain.

232
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:57,630
You think we're a bunch of losers,
but we fear nothing and no one.

233
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,270
Join us.

234
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,950
There they are.

235
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,310
Give us a hand.

236
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,670
Hurry up.

237
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,670
Here, Bomba.

238
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:17,230
Take the shipment
to the plastic depot.

239
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,270
I see you tomorrow morning.

240
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:22,670
- Where are you going?
- To a new Calabrian contact.

241
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,190
Be careful.

242
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:39,510
Biagio, the stuff is inside.
It's ready tomorrow.

243
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:47,950
- Have you changed your mind?
- I don't know.

244
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,630
What's the problem?

245
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,990
The problem is
that you don't sell to us usually.

246
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,670
But I have to expand my territory.

247
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,830
And your price has also changed.

248
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,470
Mate, why do you almost
give it away for free?

249
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:15,550
Without you, I would've been killed
in Germany, just like Mico.

250
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:18,430
You warned me
and this is me saying thank you.

251
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,310
What are we going to do?

252
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,150
Great.

253
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,510
Hello, Gegè.

254
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,270
What are you doing here?

255
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,870
Take a seat.

256
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,790
Are you afraid of me or something?

257
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,950
I said, take a seat.

258
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,870
You must be exhausted.

259
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,190
You always work long hours.

260
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,910
Now that you have a new boss.

261
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:13,910
I had no choice.
Avitabile threatened Silvano.

262
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:17,190
What do I care about that guy
that is fucking you in the arse?

263
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:28,350
You ratted me out to Avitabile
and he doesn't even give you bodyguards.

264
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:38,390
Did you think
I wouldn't come looking for you?

265
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:46,110
Gennaro, you have to believe me. The money
is safe, Avitabile can't get to it.

266
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,870
You said you belonged to the family.

267
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,230
That's why I let people tail you.

268
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:03,670
If there's one thing I learned,
it's that you can't trust family.

269
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,590
Forgive me.

270
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,270
Please forgive me.

271
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,430
Your companies are safe.

272
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,190
That's all I could do.

273
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,630
The watch.

274
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:15,070
- Hey?
- Azzurra, how are you?

275
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,990
I already told you, everything is fine.

276
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:22,510
- And Pietro?
- He's sleeping.

277
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:26,710
Have you spoken to your father?
Do you know where he is?

278
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:30,270
No, I came here, that's all I know.

279
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,790
Everything alright?

280
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:36,390
Yeah, fine. I'll see you tomorrow.

281
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,870
Good night.

282
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:44,670
That bastard
took everything away from me.

283
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:47,670
And now I'm going to
take everything back, step by step.

284
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,670
And I'll start with you.

285
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:56,030
If I hadn't picked you up,
where would you have gone?

286
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:02,390
- Nowhere.
- Bullshit.

287
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:06,750
If my men had come a little later,
where would you be now?

288
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:10,150
Were you on the run?
Did you want to screw me over as well?

289
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,270
Do you know what I thought?

290
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:17,910
Maybe that asshole would've locked me up,
and you'd know about it.

291
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,990
Did you do it together?

292
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:25,030
I have nothing to do with it, I swear.
I have nothing to do with it.

293
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,230
Let me go, you're hurting me.

294
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,590
Make sure he's quiet.

295
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,150
Quiet.

296
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,910
- Guys.
- Gennaro.

297
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:46,630
- Look what I brought with me.
- Beer?

298
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,830
- Thanks.
- Open it.

299
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,630
- Can I have your lighter?
- Yes.

300
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,070
We have to toast.

301
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,270
- Give it to me.
- Didn't you have one already?

302
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:04,190
- A toast to what?
- Our health.

303
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,950
Money.

304
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,750
To us, boys.

305
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:20,670
I can't trust anyone, only you two.

306
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:25,630
But I need to know if you have my back.

307
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,910
We have your back.

308
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,950
- Sure?
- Sure.

309
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,070
Come here.

310
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:42,470
There is a lot of money coming.

311
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,150
Come with me.

312
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,830
Prepare the transfer.

313
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:22,190
What the hell?

314
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:24,150
Who are you?

315
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:27,310
- Shut up.
- Move one inch and I'll shoot.

316
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:29,030
Take it easy.

317
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:32,070
- Hands to yourself.
- Get in the car.

318
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:36,950
- Take it easy.
- Where are you taking him?

319
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,790
Don't worry.

320
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:51,190
Tell me who sent you.

321
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:54,070
Tell me who is sending you.

322
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:00,910
Stop the car. Why?
Stop the car.

323
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:50,750
Come on, walk. Move it.

324
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:04,670
On your knees.

325
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:06,430
On your knees.

326
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:46,990
Tell me,
do you think Avitabile is a bitch?

327
00:45:57,470 --> 00:46:00,350
Why do you think
you can fuck with him?

328
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:31,150
Poor fellow.

329
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:42,790
Do you know why I had you brought here?

330
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:47,550
To show you how retarded you have been.

331
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:53,310
Do you really think the Calabrians
would choose your side?

332
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,750
Against us all?

333
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:59,550
Do you know why I came here?
Do you know why?

334
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:03,630
To kill you myself.

335
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:09,710
But you are the father of my grandson.

336
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:13,470
The husband of my daughter.

337
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:17,230
But one thing I know for sure:

338
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:19,790
From now on
you're not worth anything anymore.

339
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:24,590
You will no longer sell drugs
in the center of Naples.

340
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:29,990
You're not going to sell anyone
drugs anymore, you know why?

341
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:32,830
The new supplier only talks to us.

342
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:37,190
We beheaded your friend in Honduras.

343
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:45,110
Did you want to take away what's mine?

344
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:47,750
Now you have nothing left.

345
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:52,230
I reported you anonymously to the
Serious Fraud Office for money laundering.

346
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:56,950
During their research they have frozen
everything: the companies and the money.

347
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:59,310
You have absolutely nothing...

348
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:03,750
so just crawl back into your sewer
and stay there.

349
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:07,510
If you take one step outside of
Secondigliano, I'll destroy you.

350
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:10,990
But most of all...

351
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:14,830
You no longer have a wife and child.

352
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:19,190
You can't do that to me.

353
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:21,710
They are my flesh and blood.

354
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:23,910
You don't deserve her.

355
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:28,310
So she'll come back to me.

356
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:31,230
I will let you live.
Lonely, like a dog.

357
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:35,030
You didn't deserve her.

358
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:38,630
If you don't earn something,
you lose it.

359
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,150
Go ahead.

360
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:28,110
If I find out
that he came looking for you...

361
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:30,350
and you know I will...

362
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,990
I swear to the Holy Virgin
that I'll cut off his head.

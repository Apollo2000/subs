2
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,648
Mimmo, come take a look!

3
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,890
- Stop!
- Giovanni, come take a look.

4
00:00:47,494 --> 00:00:50,054
Never seen anything like it,
it's unbelievable.

5
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,419
- Good morning, Gianni.
- Good morning, ma'am.

6
00:01:11,421 --> 00:01:13,779
- Did you tell anyone else?
- No, just you.

7
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:16,341
Come, this way.

8
00:01:29,265 --> 00:01:31,425
And what do we do now?

9
00:01:35,587 --> 00:01:37,067
I have to notify Mr. Resta.

10
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,348
Can I rely on the silence
of your workers?

11
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,150
- I guarantee it personally.
- Thank you.

12
00:02:16,198 --> 00:02:17,798
Hi, man.

13
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:33,440
Well? Do we have any more information?

14
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:37,242
As we thought:
illegal dumping from a cemetery.

15
00:02:37,245 --> 00:02:40,403
I really don't see the problem.

16
00:02:40,406 --> 00:02:43,404
They've been dead for over 40 years
and don't have relatives,

17
00:02:43,405 --> 00:02:45,843
or they would have seen to them.

18
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:50,884
What difference does it make if they're
in an ossuary or under a carpark?

19
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:55,087
Besides, Gennaro, cemeteries
swindle money from City Hall

20
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:58,566
and we should pay
for the fraud they commit?

21
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,370
Listen, we'll put them back
where they were and close it up.

22
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:10,052
Come here, Alberto.

23
00:03:21,696 --> 00:03:25,816
- What are we building?
- An airport.

24
00:03:28,698 --> 00:03:32,138
How many others have tried
to build another airport in this city?

25
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:35,819
Only we succeeded.

26
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:41,059
You know why?

27
00:03:41,062 --> 00:03:44,740
Because we've done
everything by the book.

28
00:03:44,743 --> 00:03:47,861
Without greasing palms,
without offending anyone

29
00:03:47,864 --> 00:03:51,062
and especially without fucking up.

30
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:56,062
Now, if we do as you suggest
and it comes out,

31
00:03:56,065 --> 00:03:58,665
we'll blow everything
we've done 'til now.

32
00:04:03,388 --> 00:04:04,828
Pardon me.

33
00:04:09,029 --> 00:04:11,709
I have to take this, I'll be right back.

34
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,270
Hi, Fernando. How come at this hour?

35
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:19,072
Hold on, I'll just go in the office.

36
00:04:26,594 --> 00:04:31,832
- You don't agree with him, do you?
- I know these people well.

37
00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:34,953
It's impossible that the workers
will all keep quiet.

38
00:04:34,956 --> 00:04:39,356
It'll come out for sure
and, at that point, we risk big.

39
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,837
What would you do?

40
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:48,199
I'd get ahead of it
and go into damage control.

41
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,160
- What can happen?
- The prosecutor will open a file.

42
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,490
Okay, let's go.

43
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:31,291
It's him. Guys!

44
00:05:33,412 --> 00:05:36,810
- Good morning everyone.
- Mr Resta, what can you tell us?

45
00:05:36,813 --> 00:05:41,531
I can't tell you much
because it's still under investigation.

46
00:05:41,534 --> 00:05:44,932
However, I'd like to stress
that our consortium

47
00:05:44,934 --> 00:05:48,892
has always acted
lawfully, transparently.

48
00:05:48,896 --> 00:05:53,174
Although we are the injured party
in this sad situation,

49
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:57,656
we have decided to cover
the cost of the operation

50
00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:03,817
<i>for the removal of the remains
that criminals have buried in our land,</i>

51
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:07,739
<i>freeing the council from an expense
it already shouldered.</i>

52
00:06:07,741 --> 00:06:12,619
<i>We are investing in this area
because we believe in it,</i>

53
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:15,421
<i>we believe in opportunities
that can be created</i>

54
00:06:15,424 --> 00:06:18,342
<i>based on work and transparency.</i>

55
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:21,944
<i>This was the statement
from Alberto Resta...</i>

56
00:06:24,346 --> 00:06:26,344
- He was good.
- The voice is his.

57
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:28,464
But the brain behind him is Tiziana's.

58
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:32,346
It was her idea to report parties
unknown for the dumping of waste.

59
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:34,866
But if they shut down the site?

60
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:37,667
Tiziana says we need
public opinion on our side,

61
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:42,550
then we'll say this seizure harms us
and the community.

62
00:06:46,352 --> 00:06:49,792
Let's go,
or we'll be late for the school party.

63
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,317
In the end we didn't meet:
Walter Ruggieri, Simone's dad.

64
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,838
Gennaro Savastano, Pietro's dad.

65
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:21,079
Your last name
is more famous than mine.

66
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,000
It's the price I have to pay.

67
00:07:26,563 --> 00:07:29,161
I know,
I shouldn't in front of the kids.

68
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:33,525
But there are lots of things
we shouldn't do, but we do, right?

69
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:41,726
Who we are is sculpted
into our flesh, we can't help it.

70
00:07:43,728 --> 00:07:46,926
My father abandoned me
when I was two months old

71
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:49,889
and turned up again
when I was 20 years old.

72
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,770
He wanted to meet me.

73
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:58,688
I went, because I'm not afraid
to go and see.

74
00:07:58,691 --> 00:08:02,011
But that was the day
I decided I didn't want kids.

75
00:08:04,013 --> 00:08:06,371
But your son's right there.

76
00:08:06,374 --> 00:08:09,534
I know. My wife insisted,
she pestered me to death.

77
00:08:11,535 --> 00:08:13,615
And there he is.

78
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:18,654
The first two years I desperately
looked for feelings inside me,

79
00:08:18,657 --> 00:08:22,975
but I didn't have any,
he just annoyed me when he cried.

80
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:25,577
I shouldn't say that, I know.

81
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:28,179
That's why I chose this job.

82
00:08:30,061 --> 00:08:35,059
Justice has no mercy for anyone,
its only companion is the truth.

83
00:08:35,062 --> 00:08:39,222
And the truth is I'm a prosecutor
and you're the son of a missing boss.

84
00:08:41,023 --> 00:08:44,863
But that shitty man who gave me life
still stirs in my blood.

85
00:08:47,064 --> 00:08:48,584
And you?

86
00:08:55,948 --> 00:08:57,508
Excuse me.

87
00:09:11,832 --> 00:09:13,992
What did he want?

88
00:09:15,072 --> 00:09:17,312
He just wanted to introduce himself.

89
00:09:20,194 --> 00:09:22,874
And he wanted to scare me a little.

90
00:09:45,521 --> 00:09:48,599
- Hi, Ferdinando.
- Hi, Alberto.

91
00:09:48,602 --> 00:09:50,682
Well? What's going on?

92
00:09:53,202 --> 00:09:55,800
I've got anti-money laundering
at the bank.

93
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:59,521
They want to know
how a businessman riddled with debt

94
00:09:59,526 --> 00:10:03,486
found the money to put in the
consortium that's building the airport.

95
00:10:04,486 --> 00:10:09,684
I'm investing in a new company and
with the profits I'll repay my debts.

96
00:10:09,687 --> 00:10:14,605
They've got it in for the company
you used to join the consortium,

97
00:10:14,609 --> 00:10:17,847
as it started out with a capital
of 20 thousand euros,

98
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:22,367
then received two British investments
and the capital grew to five million.

99
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,609
And?

100
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:27,570
Trust me, get out of it all now,

101
00:10:27,572 --> 00:10:31,890
go to the prosecutor and give them
the names of who's behind the airport.

102
00:10:31,894 --> 00:10:33,772
There's no name to give.

103
00:10:33,774 --> 00:10:38,252
If the law hasn't changed overnight,
blind trusts are legal.

104
00:10:38,256 --> 00:10:40,494
Sheer conjecture, that's not enough.

105
00:10:40,496 --> 00:10:44,414
But anti-money laundering
doesn't move for no reason.

106
00:10:44,418 --> 00:10:47,458
Are you really willing to pay the price?

107
00:10:51,457 --> 00:10:54,855
The bank wants you
to repay your debt immediately,

108
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,978
or they'll start bankruptcy proceedings.

109
00:10:57,981 --> 00:10:59,381
I see.

110
00:11:01,341 --> 00:11:03,181
Thanks for the heads up.

111
00:11:14,585 --> 00:11:17,343
My Jesus, forgive us our sins.

112
00:11:17,346 --> 00:11:20,024
Save us from the fires of Hell.

113
00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:22,464
Lead all souls to Heaven,

114
00:11:22,468 --> 00:11:26,428
especially those
in most need of Thy mercy.

115
00:11:49,315 --> 00:11:52,635
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost.

116
00:11:53,636 --> 00:11:56,796
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with Thee...

117
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,957
Hello?

118
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,837
Now and at the hour of our death, amen.

119
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:13,319
Out of the depths I cry to you, O, Lord.

120
00:12:13,321 --> 00:12:15,559
Lord, hear my voice,

121
00:12:15,562 --> 00:12:19,080
let Your ears be attentive
to my cry for mercy.

122
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:23,363
If You keep a record of sins, Lord,
who could withstand Your judgement?

123
00:12:55,453 --> 00:12:57,771
- Hi, Alberto.
- Hi, Gennaro.

124
00:12:57,773 --> 00:13:02,293
- What's with all the mystery?
- Precautions.

125
00:13:04,294 --> 00:13:07,174
Did you see me today? Was I good?

126
00:13:09,056 --> 00:13:12,616
You were good.
Why did you want to see me?

127
00:13:16,618 --> 00:13:18,978
The bank's asked me to repay my debt.

128
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:25,341
I dunno, it must be this fucking thing
with the skeletons.

129
00:13:28,781 --> 00:13:31,181
- How much do you owe?
- 150 grand.

130
00:13:36,704 --> 00:13:39,622
Tomorrow morning I'll give you
the names of three companies,

131
00:13:39,624 --> 00:13:43,462
prepare three invoices for consultancy
to the amount you need.

132
00:13:43,466 --> 00:13:45,584
Thanks, Gennaro. You're a friend.

133
00:13:45,587 --> 00:13:49,105
I'm just a businessman
looking after his interests.

134
00:13:49,107 --> 00:13:52,545
If you have problems,
the consortium has problems.

135
00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:53,949
That's all.

136
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:07,990
Let me through!

137
00:14:07,993 --> 00:14:09,631
You're a robot.

138
00:14:09,633 --> 00:14:11,833
Yeah and I wanna go through...

139
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,434
Now we'll show Mama the robot.

140
00:14:19,116 --> 00:14:20,556
Show her.

141
00:14:22,715 --> 00:14:25,433
Did you show Papa the drawings
you did at school?

142
00:14:25,437 --> 00:14:28,115
You did some drawings?

143
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:31,436
He did a kite, a house...

144
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:33,636
Want some coffee?

145
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:38,037
- Our house?
- A house with the pool.

146
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,079
Did you do a drawing of Papa?

147
00:14:40,081 --> 00:14:41,881
We're done upstairs.

148
00:14:44,962 --> 00:14:48,562
Finish your yoghurt, I'll be right back.

149
00:14:59,126 --> 00:15:00,924
- Well?
- It's all clean here.

150
00:15:00,926 --> 00:15:04,044
But we can't give you 100% certainty.

151
00:15:04,048 --> 00:15:06,726
If they turned off the detectors,
we won't find them.

152
00:15:06,729 --> 00:15:09,807
We'll get our stuff and go, goodbye.

153
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,570
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

154
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:16,411
If someone got in we would have noticed.

155
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:21,409
When we're not here,
it's easy to get in.

156
00:15:21,412 --> 00:15:23,812
Gennaro, they didn't find anything.

157
00:15:28,574 --> 00:15:30,654
Maybe I got spooked.

158
00:15:33,815 --> 00:15:37,133
Or maybe that son of bitch told me
that stuff on purpose.

159
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,094
He knew I'd check.

160
00:15:40,098 --> 00:15:43,056
First he planted the doubt
then he took it away.

161
00:15:43,058 --> 00:15:47,138
So, in his mind, I'd go back
to talking normally about our stuff.

162
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,498
And even if that's true?

163
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,460
After today we have nothing bad
to talk about anymore.

164
00:16:14,946 --> 00:16:17,026
Come in.

165
00:16:19,148 --> 00:16:20,708
May I come in?

166
00:16:31,672 --> 00:16:33,792
This is from our family.

167
00:16:38,554 --> 00:16:41,234
It belonged to Mama's grandmother.

168
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,118
Don't give it to me,
wear it when you get married.

169
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,318
No, I'll never get married.

170
00:17:05,321 --> 00:17:10,361
I don't need bosses,
I have enough at home.

171
00:17:12,242 --> 00:17:15,720
First you gotta learn
to be your own boss,

172
00:17:15,722 --> 00:17:18,282
then you can find a man
who loves you and respects you.

173
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:24,525
The only one who respects me
is marrying you.

174
00:17:27,767 --> 00:17:31,245
A husband and wife can break up,

175
00:17:31,248 --> 00:17:34,768
but brother and sister
will always be brother and sister.

176
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,650
This one's from me.

177
00:17:45,772 --> 00:17:47,932
See, you need it.

178
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:08,257
I'll always be on your side, Patrizia.

179
00:18:09,658 --> 00:18:12,498
When you enter the church,
today, tomorrow...

180
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,180
I'll always be on your side.

181
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,700
Don't ever forget that.

182
00:18:26,783 --> 00:18:28,463
Give me a hand.

183
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,228
Thank you.

184
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:11,032
I know we didn't get off
to a good start,

185
00:19:11,034 --> 00:19:14,072
but today we're happy
to welcome you into this family.

186
00:19:14,075 --> 00:19:16,315
Things change.

187
00:19:17,316 --> 00:19:20,436
These are our flowers,
we picked them for you.

188
00:19:22,918 --> 00:19:24,798
Thank you so much.

189
00:20:32,377 --> 00:20:34,697
Look, there's even a pool.

190
00:20:36,739 --> 00:20:39,219
- Shall we sit here?
- Yeah, let's sit here.

191
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,020
Anything you need
there's someone inside, okay?

192
00:20:49,342 --> 00:20:50,862
Here.

193
00:20:53,422 --> 00:20:55,862
- Bye, Pietro.
- Say goodbye to Papa.

194
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:59,423
Be good.

195
00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:53,759
It's beautiful here, huh?

196
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:00,921
Yes.

197
00:22:36,211 --> 00:22:37,971
Gennaro!

198
00:22:42,452 --> 00:22:46,772
- Azzurra sends her regards.
- Thank her from me.

199
00:22:48,135 --> 00:22:50,495
Hi, Uncle, all good?

200
00:22:52,894 --> 00:22:57,054
Unfortunately I can't stay, but
I wanted to congratulate you in person.

201
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:01,377
And we're very glad you came.

202
00:23:02,898 --> 00:23:06,816
Do you mind if I walk the bride
down the aisle?

203
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,899
That's if she agrees.

204
00:23:54,272 --> 00:23:56,352
From today Secondigliano is yours.

205
00:23:58,712 --> 00:24:02,152
Don't give me anything anymore,
keep what you earn.

206
00:24:03,394 --> 00:24:07,194
- It's my wedding present.
- Why?

207
00:24:08,796 --> 00:24:11,394
You're big enough
to walk on your own two feet.

208
00:24:11,396 --> 00:24:14,636
But always be careful
of the people you trust.

209
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:21,159
Good luck, Patrizia.

210
00:24:33,483 --> 00:24:38,161
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost.

211
00:24:38,163 --> 00:24:40,321
- Amen.
- The Lord be with you.

212
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:42,523
And with your spirit.

213
00:24:42,526 --> 00:24:47,084
Dear Patrizia and Michelangelo, you
have come into the house of the Lord,

214
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:50,643
in the presence of the Church’s
minister and the community,

215
00:24:50,647 --> 00:24:54,085
so your intention to enter into Marriage

216
00:24:54,087 --> 00:24:56,527
may be strengthened with a sacred seal.

217
00:25:10,662 --> 00:25:12,700
Excuse me.

218
00:25:12,702 --> 00:25:16,702
- Can you tell me where this office is?
- Down the end on the left.

219
00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:37,949
Come in.

220
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,828
Good morning, I'm Alberto Resta.

221
00:25:43,832 --> 00:25:47,472
Please, come in.
Can you close the door?

222
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,274
It's a pleasure.

223
00:26:02,197 --> 00:26:05,595
Why have I been called in?

224
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:08,635
I just wanted to have
an informal chat with you.

225
00:26:08,638 --> 00:26:13,156
So, LT Solid, headquarters in Panama.

226
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:17,759
CAD Industrial, Luxembourg,
and Sillow Connection, London.

227
00:26:18,961 --> 00:26:20,841
Do you know these companies?

228
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,800
Of course, I work with them.

229
00:26:24,803 --> 00:26:27,243
- What work?
- I'm a consultant.

230
00:26:28,364 --> 00:26:31,082
I don't believe
there's anything illegal, is there?

231
00:26:31,084 --> 00:26:33,122
No, there isn't.

232
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:36,322
There might be a couple of anomalies.

233
00:26:36,326 --> 00:26:37,966
And what would they be?

234
00:26:39,526 --> 00:26:41,884
These companies paid you
consultation fees

235
00:26:41,886 --> 00:26:45,844
just in time to cover your exposure
with the bank.

236
00:26:45,848 --> 00:26:48,886
No, it's exactly the opposite.

237
00:26:48,889 --> 00:26:51,567
I had credits with these companies
for months

238
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:55,610
and I pressed them for payment
when the bank came down on me.

239
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:03,213
The second anomaly?

240
00:27:05,534 --> 00:27:07,892
That they chose as a consultant

241
00:27:07,894 --> 00:27:11,454
a businessman who without
murky capital would have failed.

242
00:27:14,336 --> 00:27:18,896
I don't think I understand
what you're talking about.

243
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:36,581
Now, if our chat's over, I'd like to go.

244
00:27:37,902 --> 00:27:40,460
Please, go.

245
00:27:40,463 --> 00:27:45,183
I hope that after all these debts
you've learned to handle the tension.

246
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:57,547
Goodbye.

247
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:01,069
Is it good?

248
00:28:09,792 --> 00:28:11,192
Well?

249
00:28:19,994 --> 00:28:22,114
Patrizia accepted.

250
00:28:24,156 --> 00:28:28,396
What else would she do?
You gave her this wedding present...

251
00:28:31,317 --> 00:28:35,155
From today, all our ties with
Secondigliano are severed.

252
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:38,279
They just have to let us reopen
the worksite.

253
00:28:42,081 --> 00:28:46,521
- Tiziana is taking care of that.
- In the end, you were right...

254
00:28:48,122 --> 00:28:50,722
To fly, a plane needs to detach
from the ground.

255
00:28:55,564 --> 00:28:58,324
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

256
00:29:08,407 --> 00:29:09,885
Tiziana...

257
00:29:09,887 --> 00:29:13,005
All the funds transfers,
all the payments we've made,

258
00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:16,167
you verified them all, right?

259
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:17,927
Of course.

260
00:29:17,931 --> 00:29:22,169
Is there any chance
something might look strange?

261
00:29:22,171 --> 00:29:24,091
Absolutely not. Why?

262
00:29:25,572 --> 00:29:30,132
- Are you sure? It's very important.
- Yes, I'm sure.

263
00:29:31,574 --> 00:29:34,414
Nothing looks strange
about the funds or the payments.

264
00:29:36,414 --> 00:29:40,532
I know exactly what we're doing.
And with whom.

265
00:29:40,537 --> 00:29:43,015
You hired me because
I'm competent, didn't you?

266
00:29:43,017 --> 00:29:47,017
Do you think I'd let anything strange
show up and risk everything?

267
00:29:55,501 --> 00:29:57,981
But now you have to tell me
what's going on.

268
00:30:03,262 --> 00:30:06,222
I'll tell you, but it has
to stay between you and me.

269
00:30:50,435 --> 00:30:53,795
Hi, Tiziana. Well?

270
00:30:58,837 --> 00:31:01,797
Alberto was summoned
to the prosecutor's office.

271
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:09,959
They asked him to name you.

272
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,560
But he held out, he protected you.

273
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:17,762
He wanted me to reassure him
about the accounts.

274
00:31:26,605 --> 00:31:28,725
Maybe you know Alberto better than me.

275
00:31:40,849 --> 00:31:43,089
But now I want you to tell me something.

276
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:47,970
Do you think he'll hold out
the next time, too?

277
00:32:28,582 --> 00:32:32,302
It's beautiful, Gennaro.
It's really beautiful.

278
00:32:35,784 --> 00:32:37,424
I'm glad you like it.

279
00:32:38,744 --> 00:32:40,704
Do you wanna tell me why we're here?

280
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:57,870
What are you thinking?

281
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:11,393
I'm thinking about those
who gave their lives to get us here.

282
00:33:50,724 --> 00:33:54,204
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- It's beautiful.

283
00:33:56,325 --> 00:34:00,005
If we buy it, I have connections
in City Hall for the restoration.

284
00:34:01,687 --> 00:34:04,207
The price you told me is favorable.

285
00:34:19,213 --> 00:34:21,093
You know, I had a friend...

286
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:24,773
a brother.

287
00:34:27,214 --> 00:34:32,214
I look at the sea and think that he's
there, somewhere, watching me.

288
00:34:40,338 --> 00:34:42,898
Anything you want to tell me, Alberto?

289
00:34:46,499 --> 00:34:50,059
- No.
- Are you sure?

290
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,060
Yes.

291
00:34:57,583 --> 00:34:59,703
All good, then.

292
00:35:02,824 --> 00:35:04,464
What is it, Gennaro?

293
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:08,265
Don't you trust me anymore?

294
00:35:10,146 --> 00:35:13,426
Alberto, you know, I don't trust anyone.

295
00:35:14,787 --> 00:35:16,987
But we're good.

296
00:35:34,472 --> 00:35:40,232
- So, do we buy this place or not?
- Of course! Of course we'll buy it.

297
00:35:41,315 --> 00:35:43,275
Then let's buy it.

298
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:45,955
Let's go.

299
00:36:19,724 --> 00:36:21,844
- See you, Gennaro.
- See you, Alberto.

300
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,030
Fuck!

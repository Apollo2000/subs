1
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,320
With that amount of good stuff,
no one can beat us.

2
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,880
But we will attract attention.

3
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,840
And Blue Blood?

4
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,400
He had to prove himself, you said.
He did.

5
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,920
He killed a stranger to keep you happy.

6
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,160
You know that too.

7
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,840
But now the real killing
will commence...

8
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,120
and if they catch him or his men, I don't
know how he'll react. You don't either.

9
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,240
Before he met me, he was a nobody.

10
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,280
He hadn't done anything
like what he's doing now.

11
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,400
He knows he'll be nowhere without us.

12
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,320
But Enzo isn't stupid.

13
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,760
That's why I chose him.

14
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,760
I thought I could cross Avitabile...

15
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,040
but he crossed me.

16
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,360
Now I don't even trust myself anymore.

17
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,080
But I trust you.

18
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Translated by: NederSubs

19
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,320
I get you, Gennaro...

20
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,360
but I don't understand
how you can trust Ciro.

21
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,880
Only when they touch your family,
you show who you really are.

22
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,960
And I saw Ciro di Marzio.
And he saw me.

23
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,760
That's how it always has been.
And now he's more than family to me.

24
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,880
You also left your family
to protect my dad, right?

25
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,920
My father thought he had the best
soldier on his side, and he did.

26
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,160
I saw something else as well:
It's not over yet.

27
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,840
What do you mean?

28
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,320
Let me know
when you arrive where you want to be.

29
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,080
- Welcome.
- Hey, kid.

30
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,320
- This is Ciro.
- Valerio, a pleasure.

31
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,680
Enzo said good things about you.

32
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,040
You know this is serious, right?

33
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,080
Of course.
Come in, our host expects us.

34
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,720
Wait a second.

35
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,360
Before we go in,
I want to know where the stuff is going.

36
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,280
The client is a partner in a large company
in London. That's where the coke is going.

37
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,120
And how does he get it there?

38
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,800
With a diplomatic passport.
His dad works at the Italian consulate.

39
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,800
What do you get from it?

40
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,720
Your respect and friendship,
and a share from the client.

41
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,000
- Take me to him.
- Come with me.

42
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,800
Antonello Rodi, a pleasure.

43
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,880
I heard you're looking for something,
is that right?

44
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,400
Valerio said I could talk to you
about a big order.

45
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,400
- How much?
- 200,000.

46
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,240
Where's the money?

47
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,640
Antonello...

48
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,000
We have to agree on a price.

49
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,240
I heard 43,000 euros per kilo
is a reasonable price.

50
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,560
Can I expect a volume discount?

51
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,720
We're not going under 40.

52
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,000
Then it will be five kilos,
that sounds good.

53
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,320
When is the delivery?

54
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,560
- Now, if you want.
- Give me your key, I'll go.

55
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,160
This car will draw too much attention.

56
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,120
If you stay below 300 km/h,
no cop will pull over a car like this.

57
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,640
You're coming with me.

58
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,680
That friend of yours thinks he's God.

59
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,760
He is not a god,
but he does open doors.

60
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,360
To him, we are that car,
going at 300 km/h.

61
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,000
But at the first sign of trouble,
he switches cars.

62
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,400
That car is not his.

63
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,760
What am I to you?

64
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,240
You're like how I was 10 years ago.

65
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,320
I was angry, hungry,
as ambitious as a young dog.

66
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,200
I felt I was the strongest of all.

67
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,120
But not anymore?

68
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,120
That was a different life.

69
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,640
And yet you're joining us. Why?

70
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,160
I couldn't take it anymore,
being in hell on my own.

71
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,280
This is a kilo.

72
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,040
You bought five of these packages.

73
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,080
Tell your friend he'll receive a gift
if this continues.

74
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,160
Guys, police.

75
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,680
- Where?
- At gate 9.

76
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,040
- How many cars?
- One, but they sniff around everywhere.

77
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,240
- I'll go.
- Everything loaded up? Hurry then.

78
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,440
Faster. Close it down.

79
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,320
- Hurry up.
- Close it down.

80
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,720
Get out of the car.

81
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,840
Get out of the car.

82
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,800
On your knees. Hurry up.

83
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,560
Hurry up.

84
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,560
Face down.

85
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,520
Can we trust your friend
if they catch him?

86
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,280
We'll have to see.
I think he's got balls.

87
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,240
Quite a big amount.

88
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,560
And it's still bricks.

89
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,080
That's a lot of work.

90
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,080
- We've grown out of this place.
- Then we'll find another.

91
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,920
- Enzo, what's up?
- Hey, Don Saverio.

92
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,680
- I have a proposal for you.
- Come in.

93
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,200
When do you need it?

94
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,040
Immediately.

95
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,920
If everything goes well,
you'll get twice the amount next month.

96
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,360
Really?

97
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,880
Really.

98
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,360
- How much junk does that guy have?
- Let's throw everything away.

99
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,880
Except for Padre Pio.

100
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,400
Hey, you're free.

101
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,920
- And? What did they ask you?
- I said I wanted to test drive the car.

102
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,520
- And then?
- Nothing, Antonello confirmed it.

103
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,680
I got a reprimand from the commissioner,
and that's it.

104
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,720
Yes, because you're from Posillipo.

105
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,840
- We would've been in prison.
- That's why I lured them away.

106
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,880
Goliat, prepare the coke for his friend.
Come with me.

107
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,360
- You should've seen Ciro's face.
- Was he surprised?

108
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,960
So you see, yuppies also have balls.

109
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,440
- Ours are bigger.
- Your words.

110
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,440
I'll show you out.

111
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,920
Check if it works.

112
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,760
Looks good, man.

113
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,440
Two and five.

114
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,920
- Where do all those people come from?
- They're friends of Valerio.

115
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,080
- This stuff is flying off the shelf.
- It does.

116
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,680
Hey, Mullet. And?

117
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,520
Hey, guys. They're ready.

118
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,600
- Now they'll fly.
- You're the man.

119
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,400
- Bye, buddy.
- Bye, guys.

120
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,640
- You were great.
- Assholes.

121
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,480
Sir, there's a delivery for you.

122
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,040
This package is for room 412.

123
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,000
Goodbye.

124
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,800
Here you go.

125
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,080
- 50,000, and we've just started.
- And nobody notices.

126
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,440
- Those assholes wanted to cross us.
- But we crossed them.

127
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,560
Soon, there will be nothing left of them.

128
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,080
Carmela, I'm here.
What did you want to tell me?

129
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,160
I know everything, Enzo.

130
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,120
You're going against people who've
been in this profession for 50 years.

131
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,120
In those 50 years on the streets,
they only suffered colds.

132
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,600
- You're in over your head.
- Don't worry.

133
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,720
They know
you have nothing to do with it.

134
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,880
- You kept your word.
- I don't want to cry about you.

135
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,880
I know you very well.

136
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Tell me, honestly, have you never
wanted to kill those thugs?

137
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,120
I dreamed about it every night.

138
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,080
Now it's no longer a dream.

139
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,600
This is our moment.

140
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,000
- Are you coming, Enzo?
- I'm coming.

141
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,400
Did you see that car?

142
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,320
- What about it?
- It was parked out front.

143
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,680
I saw it on the monitor.

144
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,000
We have to be careful, they found us.

145
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,000
Are you coming along?

146
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,960
Close the door.

147
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,960
And?

148
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,120
Blue Blood is the reason
our revenue has dropped.

149
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,240
Come here.

150
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:38,760
How is it possible that a couple of brats
with no pubic hair can screw us over?

151
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,400
You are surrounded by idiots. Get out.

152
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,200
They were able to do this
because they know us.

153
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,720
But we didn't know them, that's why
we didn't pay attention to them.

154
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,360
Fine.

155
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,240
- We have to get rid of him.
- Okay.

156
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,120
Wait, come here. Come here.

157
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,400
I want to look that scumbag in the eye
before he dies.

158
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:15,640
I know something. We'll bring him to you,
and then you can handle it yourself.

159
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,320
Fine, you do that.

160
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,520
What's this?

161
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,040
The gift I promised.
Pay me if you sell it.

162
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,640
I would only get it
if we continued our partnership.

163
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,960
You saved Valerio from the police,
a brother.

164
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,720
So hereby our partnership is continued.

165
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,320
We can no longer condone this business.

166
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,760
We have to get rid of him.

167
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,800
That makes sense.

168
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,640
I know only one thing:

169
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,000
You only get rid of someone
if there's no other solution.

170
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,080
I respect that idea...

171
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,960
but he has the same blood
as his grandfather.

172
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,760
Leave this to me, Ruggero.
I'll finish it.

173
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,960
How can such a brave kid
suddenly have so much big talk?

174
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,680
What do you mean?

175
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:16,960
Blue Blood is backed by someone higher up.
That's the person we have to deal with.

176
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,080
- Who can that be?
- I don't know.

177
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,280
If I knew, he would be the first one
I would get rid of.

178
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,800
We need to find out
who our real enemy is.

179
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:35,040
- You must talk to Blue Blood.
- I should talk to him?

180
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,640
- Do you really mean that?
- It's your zone, Eduardo.

181
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,800
Donna Carmela.

182
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,720
Can we talk for a second?

183
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,200
Where in the world
should we talk about?

184
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,280
Kids these days.

185
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,880
These children are born smart,
but they know nothing about life.

186
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,040
If you want to learn, you find someone
higher than you. No idiots.

187
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,160
For that, you'll need
people with experience.

188
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,440
And we have enough of those.

189
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,960
Don Eduardo...

190
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,040
Could you get to the point?

191
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,400
Enzo has to stay below us.

192
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,640
We have a good proposal for him.

193
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,560
Talk him into it. He'll listen to you.

194
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,200
What you're saying makes sense...

195
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,680
to a family member.

196
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,080
But I think we've never been family.

197
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,200
So what, Donna Carmela?

198
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,080
We can always become family.

199
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,320
- Forget about the past, see the future.
- The past teaches you how to live.

200
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,480
That's what my father once said.

201
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,640
Of course.

202
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,400
That's why I sit here at your table.

203
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,280
Other people
wouldn't have come here to talk.

204
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,680
I won't waste any more of your time.

205
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,440
Good evening.

206
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,440
Room 4.

207
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,160
- One?
- Yes.

208
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,120
Sweetheart.

209
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,520
- You're so beautiful.
- I can't take it anymore.

210
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,080
I missed you, you know?

211
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,600
I'll come back.
I'm conquering it piece by piece.

212
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,040
I don't want you to worry about me.

213
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,080
And Pietro?

214
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,120
He's doing fine.

215
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,680
I often tell him about you,
I say that Dad will come home soon.

216
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,960
You only have to think about him.

217
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,520
- He is the most important.
- I know.

218
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,080
Great.

219
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,600
I'm working on that, Gennaro.

220
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,240
Azzurra, is everything alright?

221
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,040
Yes, Mom, I'm coming.

222
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,960
Do you remember your father?

223
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,880
Not really.

224
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,280
He was always in a hurry.

225
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,040
He once went to buy a present with me,
at Christmas.

226
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,640
How was he?

227
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,800
I don't remember.

228
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,640
He left when he was 35
and then he was in jail for 20 years.

229
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,240
He spent more time in jail than outside.

230
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:08,120
According to Carmela, your dad would
certainly take the deal they'll offer you.

231
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,440
Time will tell.

232
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,640
But what do you think?

233
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,360
I'm going to talk to Arenella.

234
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,040
You don't know me that well.

235
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,200
I'm always to the point.

236
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,720
Fine, then let's not
waste each other's time.

237
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,880
Stregone is your grandfather's brother,
your blood is in his heart.

238
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,040
That's why he asked me
to also see your side of things.

239
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:41,000
I won't kill you now, this is not the time.
But don't forget this.

240
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,440
If that time comes,
we'll see who's still standing.

241
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:59,160
Okay. I'll give you two zones. What your
father always wanted, but never received.

242
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,080
Via Cicerone and Via Plinio, two streets
where you can make a lot of money.

243
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,520
- What do you want in return?
- What you're taking away from us.

244
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,680
We have our own channels.

245
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,640
You'll have to silence them,
and tell me who they are.

246
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,920
I've never betrayed my brothers.

247
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,840
Poor kid...
You are no more than a rascal.

248
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,560
You only have to tell me
who's behind you.

249
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,000
Your days are numbered.
Watch your back.

250
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,800
That applies to everyone, Don Eduardo.

251
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,080
Come on, guys.

252
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,800
- Who's there?
- It's me.

253
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,120
Come in.

254
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,320
Why are you here?

255
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:18,040
You are no longer alone in hell.
I also bought a ticket.

256
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,600
What do you mean?

257
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,920
I told them no.

258
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,480
No to what?

259
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:30,080
Ciro, I'm under no illusions.
I know it's every man for himself...

260
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,000
but sometimes it's better
to invest in people rather than things.

261
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,160
Maybe, but that never happened to me.

262
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,960
Nor to me, until now.

263
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:46,160
Today, life surprised me.
They offered me the world and I said no.

264
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,440
You know what the price was?

265
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,400
You would've had to die.

266
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,960
The war is about to begin.

267
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,520
Enzo is ready.

268
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,800
What happened?

269
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,800
They offered him
everything his father died for.

270
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,520
He said no.
He had to choose and he chose us.

271
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,000
He chose you.

272
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,080
That's why you're so happy.

273
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,840
What is it?

274
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,040
I've never hated someone
as much as you.

275
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,960
But we're finally on the same side...

276
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,240
and I don't want to end up alone.

277
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,920
NEXT TIME

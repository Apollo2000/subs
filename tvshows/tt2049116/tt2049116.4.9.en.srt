2
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,480
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Goliath tipped me off.

3
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,600
We need drugs, Elia.

4
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,880
Soldiers make war.
The commander only strategizes.

5
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,720
Time for strategy is over.

6
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,440
Or not?

7
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,280
Let's go shopping, guys!

8
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,000
But what the fuck are you doing there?

9
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,680
Get outta here.

10
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,600
Pieces of shit!

11
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,600
Let's go.

12
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,558
<i>This is one of the scenes
of last night's shooting</i>

13
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,318
<i>that took place around 2am
in the Forcella area.</i>

14
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,838
<i>The reason for the attack
is still not clear,</i>

15
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,078
<i>but investigators are following
the lead of gang rivalry.</i>

16
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,678
<i>Terror among the residents,</i>

17
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,758
<i>who fear this may only be
the beginning of a new feud,</i>

18
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,838
<i>like the one that took over
the historic center last year.</i>

19
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,518
<i>The victims' names
have not yet been released,</i>

20
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,998
<i>but they're all very young,
between 18 and 23.</i>

21
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,520
<i>The police commissioner of Naples
has arrived on the crime scene.</i>

22
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,440
We haven't got a gram of stuff left.

23
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,920
Only he knew where it was.

24
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,640
Yet another fine gift
from that scumbag Valerio.

25
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,918
The time's come to wipe off
the Capaccios of the face of the earth.

26
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,078
You're right.

27
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,398
But before shooting,
we need to know if we can.

28
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,920
Do you hear what you're saying,
Pure'n'Simple?

29
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,078
You also got a kid coming.

30
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,678
What are you gonna teach him?

31
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,238
That if they kill your brother
you look the other way?

32
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,160
You don't understand a fucking thing.

33
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,960
I'm willing to die for Forcella.

34
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,880
But there's gotta be a good reason.

35
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,840
If you want to kill the Capaccios,
I'm with you.

36
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,438
But also if you want
to negotiate with them.

37
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,318
We can't afford a war right now.

38
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,118
Enzo, you gotta talk to them.

39
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,200
We're on our own.

40
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,558
The Capaccios came onto our turf
because they thought they could.

41
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,480
We can't negotiate with them,
the war's already begun.

42
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,640
But I agree with you:
we can't be on our own.

43
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,720
Donna Patrizia...

44
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:15,438
Did you hear what happened?
The Capaccios have gotten out.

45
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,880
This is a problem for everybody,
including you.

46
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,240
Nicola betrayed us to go with them,
didn't he? Valerio did the same.

47
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,960
They took all our stashes.

48
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,760
I'm sorry.

49
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,398
You gotta decide.

50
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,638
You wanna be with us

51
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,040
or wait till they come
and fucking take Secondigliano?

52
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,078
For now I can't go to war with anyone.

53
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,560
I can't help you,
you have to handle it on your own.

54
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,118
Central Naples' issues can't come here.

55
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,120
Secondigliano has
to remain independent.

56
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,518
Mr Savastano,
the staff will be here soon.

57
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,560
It's best if you're not seen here
during the day.

58
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,278
D'you see I changed
the name on the door?

59
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,360
Thank you.

60
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,878
Anyway, don't worry.

61
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,880
I just came to shake my new CEO 's hand.

62
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,000
- Is that a problem?
- No.

63
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,518
Tomorrow there's the press conference
for the reopening of the site.

64
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,880
I've written a short speech
and I want to remember Alberto.

65
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,198
I'll say he was an honest
businessman and a great man

66
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,040
and that his death in a tragic
accident has affected us all.

67
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,160
And what more is there to say?

68
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,080
And if they ask me questions?

69
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,438
You smile,

70
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,360
and say that the streets are no longer
safe, so we're taking to the sky.

71
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,440
We're on our own, guys.

72
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,520
But we can't stop.

73
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,000
I need to know if you're with me.

74
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,800
Because I have to count on all of you.

75
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,958
We gotta know all
about the Capaccios:

76
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,718
what they do, when they sleep,
when they piss.

77
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,080
If we have friends in their area,
now's the time to ask for favors.

78
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,038
Forcella's ours and no one
must take it away from us.

79
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,760
What are you waiting for? Come on!

80
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,318
Let's go, Pure'n'Simple.

81
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,880
Let's go, guys.

82
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,600
Enzo's closed off the neighborhood.

83
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,118
He's locked himself in a cage.

84
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,798
He won't stop till he's killed you.

85
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,880
He's got no coke, no money, he hasn't
even got the loyalty of his soldiers.

86
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,558
We just have to wait.

87
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,160
All water runs to the sea.

88
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,158
If we lose control of Forcella
someone's gonna step in.

89
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,200
And not necessarily a friend of yours.

90
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,520
Ferdinando, you know he's right?

91
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,080
But if he's here, it means
he and his friends have got an idea.

92
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,678
A friend of my cousin's
from the Luzzatti neighborhood

93
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,038
says that Crazy goes for a massage
at a Chinese-parlor every week.

94
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,800
Tonight too, she gave me the address.

95
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,358
Enzo, are you serious?

96
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,878
We don't know the place,
we don't know if he goes alone.

97
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,678
But there's no time.

98
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,358
We can't miss this opportunity,
we need to take out that asshole.

99
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,640
The sooner the better.

100
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,720
If you don't feel like it, never mind.

101
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,120
Tonight we'll whack the bastard.

102
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,280
You did good.

103
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,760
You can sit there, Mr Savastano.

104
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,878
So, Mr Savastano, if you're sure
you want to go ahead,

105
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,318
we can do the first treatment tomorrow,
both for the scar and the tattoo.

106
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,718
It's a very simple procedure
with a local anaesthetic.

107
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,678
Thank you.

108
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,160
- You want to meet him?
- Who?

109
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,560
The new Gennaro Savastano.

110
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,440
Where is he?

111
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,160
Stay here, I'll go check.

112
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,678
What was that?

113
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,278
- Let's go see.
- Enzo said to stay here.

114
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,678
As soon as they come out, we gotta go.

115
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,838
You stay here. Let's go, bro'.

116
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,320
Where are you going?

117
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,838
- What the fuck happened?
- It was a trap, he sold us out.

118
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,560
They're in the hallway.

119
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,440
We gotta get outta here!

120
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,158
The scumbag sold us out, Enzo!

121
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,640
Let's go!

122
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:35,840
- What happened?
- Nothing, go. Go, go!

123
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,480
Fuck it!

124
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,000
We're losing.

125
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,600
We're losing our brothers.

126
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,760
Are you okay?

127
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Valerio said he once saw something
in me that's not there now.

128
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,598
If he didn't see it,
that doesn't mean it's not still there.

129
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,440
Besides, what Valerio said
doesn't count anymore.

130
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,320
He was a rat.

131
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,888
I'm really pleased
you're doing this for yourself.

132
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,570
The doctor said it's nothing,
don't worry.

133
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,610
What's the matter?

134
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,288
Tiziana was a little tense.

135
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,448
I'll drop in on the press
conference first,

136
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,610
so I can check
everything's under control.

137
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,090
You know you can't go, right?

138
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,208
I know you've changed,

139
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,530
but for the rest of the world
you're Gennaro Savastano.

140
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,290
The boss of Secondigliano.

141
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:46,210
But if it will put your mind at rest,
I'll go to the press conference.

142
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:01,130
What the fuck have I done
all this shit for?

143
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,490
The airport, the consortium,
the company...

144
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,848
Only to end up like my father,

145
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:15,170
who lived his whole life
trapped in a golden cage.

146
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:23,850
The difference is everything
your father did, he did it for himself.

147
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,890
You're doing it for your son.

148
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,490
And that's something
you mustn't forget.

149
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:59,608
What the fuck did you do?
It's a miracle I'm alive!

150
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,768
- I see you're still here.
- And so's Enzo.

151
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:05,450
- And that's a problem.
- Yeah, but calm down.

152
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:22,688
We're risking big,

153
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:25,010
and we can't afford it anymore.

154
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,288
We have to destroy Enzo
before he recovers.

155
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:31,530
If you're in such a hurry
why don't you kill Enzo yourself?

156
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:38,248
Because no one would want a rat
in charge of Forcella.

157
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,970
But Blue Blood's no longer up to it,
like Patrizia.

158
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:45,568
And when stuff goes bad
you throw it out.

159
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,250
Don't you?

160
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,690
See what you can do.

161
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:28,570
Valerio said if anything happened
to him, I was to give you this.

162
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,650
For my son you were his family.

163
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,930
That's what he told me.

164
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:50,090
"His family."

165
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,730
We've lost another battle
but it's not over.

166
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:23,168
We need to collect as much money
as we can for more drugs,

167
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:26,928
but we need to keep something
for our friend's families,

168
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,688
because no one

169
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:33,290
must say that
we've been weakened in Forcella.

170
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:43,808
Go ask for the week's money
from those who haven't paid yet,

171
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:48,210
then go to the warehouse,
bring back everything we've got left.

172
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:59,050
You handle security
in the neighborhood, is that clear?

173
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,848
I'll take care of the drugs.

174
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,450
Let's go.

175
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:16,090
I'm not letting you go alone,
I'll come too.

176
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,848
I made up my mind, Pure'n'Simple.

177
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,770
Will you tell me what happened?

178
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:28,568
- He wants to go to his contact alone.
- No way.

179
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:32,128
You're about to have a kid.
We already lost too many brothers.

180
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,888
I'm going alone, it's easier.

181
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,410
Enzo's right, you need
to stay in the neighborhood.

182
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,690
I'll come with you.

183
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,490
I'm good.

184
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,850
I'm on my way.

185
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:01,770
You're done, Blue Blood.

186
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:06,370
This is the last time you fuck up.

187
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,530
You wanna kill me
like you did with Valerio?

188
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,690
Don't push me.

189
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,010
He left me a note.

190
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:44,728
You went over to the Capaccios
to screw him first, and then me.

191
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,170
You're nobody!

192
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:07,848
He said there's a big shot behind you.

193
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,210
I want to know who he is.

194
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,370
Why don't you ask your buddy?

195
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:24,170
Because the dead can't talk.

196
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:51,408
We didn't know anything,
we don't know how Enzo found out.

197
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:55,488
We got nothing to hide. If you
don't believe it, you can kill us.

198
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:57,250
No, I believe you.

199
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,370
That's why you're still here.

200
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,248
But if you want to stay alive,
bring me my brother.

201
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:10,170
- We'll need time.
- We don't know where he is.

202
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:17,610
If Ferdinando doesn't come back,
you know what happens?

203
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:25,170
A dog without a master
doesn't live long on the street.

204
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,850
Leave it.

205
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:48,410
- Only I can save you.
- Yeah?

206
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:54,048
But you gotta tell me who's backing you.

207
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:56,970
- And what would that change for you?
- Just tell me!

208
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:00,650
If I tell you now, you'll kill me.

209
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,408
It'd be the end of me.

210
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:07,170
You decide how much you want to suffer.

211
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,210
But you gotta talk.

212
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:20,330
Because Valerio died trying
to find this out.

213
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:30,730
- And I gotta finish what he started.
- Then finish it!

214
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:42,568
- You're done playing crazy.
- You wanna do it?

215
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:45,330
He's shitting himself.
Now let's fuck him up.

216
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,170
When?

217
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:54,370
- On my way.
- Sack of shit!

218
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,528
Enzo, Anna called.

219
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:05,410
She's giving birth. I gotta go.

220
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,530
Good morning.

221
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,970
Good morning.

222
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:54,688
Can Simone come play at our place
one of these days?

223
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,930
Pietro would like that a lot.

224
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:02,488
We'll come pick him up at your place

225
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,170
and take him home again.

226
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:13,090
I wouldn't want to bother you.

227
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:17,530
But that's not the truth.

228
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:23,248
And we said we'd always
tell each other the truth.

229
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:26,808
The problem isn't bothering me.

230
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,770
It's who I am.

231
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:36,370
But now, also thanks to you,
I know who I am.

232
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,410
Come along, sweetheart.

233
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:16,090
Anna, what happened?

234
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,610
Is everything all right?

235
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,928
What is it? Is everything all right?

236
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,848
Baby...

237
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:29,570
Before you judge,
listen to what they have to say.

238
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:34,010
I want our son
to grow up with a father.

239
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,290
Pure'n'Simple...

240
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,570
Enzo's losing.

241
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:03,090
You know it yourself,
things can't go on like this.

242
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,688
They're with us too.

243
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:09,648
We don't want to fight a war
between brothers

244
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:12,448
and we're sick to fucking death
of losing our men.

245
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,410
We've done big things together.

246
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:20,128
But we're not kids anymore.

247
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:23,248
Pure'n'Simple, it's better for everyone
if we go over to the Capaccios.

248
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:26,210
And what's the price for all this?

249
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,690
You know all too well.

250
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,210
Answer.

251
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:58,610
- Enzo.
- All good?

252
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:03,930
We gotta celebrate.

253
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,570
What are you going to call him?

254
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:17,728
Anna wants to call him Valerio
like his grandfather.

255
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,650
But I said no.

256
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:23,370
My son can't have a traitor's name.

257
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:29,570
We gotta go. They're coming.

258
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,850
I want to name him after you.

259
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,170
Because you're my brother.

260
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,690
I'll see you later, Enzo.

261
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,770
What's going on?

262
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,250
I want to show you something.

263
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:36,090
Tell us who's behind you.

264
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:47,250
Your husband's lucky.

265
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:51,490
Because he fucked you twice.

266
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:56,610
Once in bed and once in business.

267
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:03,210
They want to take Secondigliano,
him and his family.

268
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:08,530
And they want to stick it up your ass.

269
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,850
They wiped out all my brothers.

270
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:26,410
Forcella's in the Graduate's hands now.

271
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:32,010
You can still make it.

272
00:39:17,429 --> 00:39:22,429

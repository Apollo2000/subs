1
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,599
Dad, the truck's here.

2
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,199
OK.

3
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,599
Yes, Dad.

4
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,439
All right, got it.

5
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,559
I'll call you when I'm done.

6
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,439
Is this 22,500 euros?

7
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,359
1,500 a head.

8
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,519
I want an extra 500 a head.

9
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,439
- They don't have it.
- I don't care.

10
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,839
If they don't pay,
they stay in the container, tell them.

11
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,679
- All good?
- Seems to be.

12
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,079
What the fuck are you doing?

13
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,719
What the fuck are you doing?

14
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,679
What did I tell you?

15
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,559
Italian piece of shit.

16
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,479
- They already paid.
- Ah, they already paid...

17
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,919
I say who's paid and who hasn't.

18
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,799
Got it?

19
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,279
Now fix this mess.

20
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,479
My son, wake up!

21
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,399
Speak to me, my son!

22
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,959
Come on, come on.

23
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,199
Down.

24
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,199
Stop.

25
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,319
Go up.

26
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,319
A bit higher.

27
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,519
A bit more... that's it.

28
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,719
Come on, I want you to play,
to fight...

29
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,359
Like that, take him down! Bravo!

30
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,519
Again, from the top.

31
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,279
Fight!

32
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,319
Try again, come on!

33
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,679
That's no good. Start again.

34
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,799
Hi, Ciro.

35
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,079
Get up!

36
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,919
My son complained about you.

37
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,439
- From the beginning.
- I'm sorry.

38
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,999
Men without any passions frighten me.

39
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,999
You never seem to like anything.

40
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,479
What I liked doesn't exist anymore,
Valentin.

41
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,319
I'm just fine with you,

42
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,599
I do what you say

43
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,959
and I don't have time
to think about anything else.

44
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,359
My son would like you to take care
of the houses in Lyulin.

45
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,239
Is that a problem for you?

46
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,199
No, no problem.

47
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,119
Don't ever go against him.

48
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
All right.

49
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,559
Move it.

50
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,679
Keep going, guys.

51
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,719
I wanna see a nice attack.
That's it.

52
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,039
C'mon.

53
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,519
Clear out 7 and 15.

54
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,119
Good morning.

55
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,679
You gotta leave.

56
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,759
Please, my husband is sick,

57
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,439
he came home from the hospital
yesterday, he's dying.

58
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,319
Get your things and go.

59
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,919
- Take it, please.
- Get out.

60
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,279
- Take it.
- You don't understand.

61
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,919
You don't understand!

62
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,799
We haven't got anywhere to go.

63
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,039
You don't understand.

64
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,119
Don't you understand?
You have to leave!

65
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,719
Get out of here, or I'll kill you!

66
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,959
I'll give you five minutes.
Five minutes!

67
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,319
C'mon, show your passports.

68
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,399
Get out.

69
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,159
- Faster!
- Passports.

70
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,759
- Quickly!
- Get your passports ready.

71
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,199
- Passports!
- Come on, quicker!

72
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,879
Move it!

73
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,839
Quickly!

74
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,119
Passport!

75
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,999
Quick.

76
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,239
Move it.

77
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,999
You can put your things here.

78
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,159
This is the kitchen.

79
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,839
We'll bring you food to cook.

80
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,599
You can't go out shopping

81
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,719
and you can't leave.

82
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,159
Understood?

83
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,319
Is that clear? You can't go out.

84
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,559
I'm in charge here!

85
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,719
Will you let me call home?

86
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,759
To Albania.

87
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,880
Please.

88
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,959
I don't understand your language.

89
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,999
Phone call.

90
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,719
- A phone call, please.
- No.

91
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,319
- Please.
- I don't understand you.

92
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,959
- No phone calls.
- Please.

93
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,279
- Please, be kind to me.
- No phone calls!

94
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,919
- Please!
- No phone calls!

95
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,079
- No phone calls!
- Please...

96
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,999
I don't understand!

97
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,559
Keep her locked in there!

98
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,799
Yes, Mladen.

99
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,039
Of course.

100
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,999
Italians?

101
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,759
All right.

102
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,399
- Hi, Ciro.
- Is Mladen upstairs?

103
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,999
A vodka, please.

104
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,199
How are things?

105
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,279
Good.

106
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,719
And a whiskey.

107
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,999
Ah, you're here.

108
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,679
Have they arrived?

109
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,679
Why, are you in a hurry?

110
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,679
They're on their way.

111
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,639
How much are they buying?

112
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,279
- 100,000 euros.
- Payment?

113
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,759
Immediately, on the nail.

114
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,439
Do you know them?

115
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,359
Yeah.

116
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,159
Fellow countrymen of yours.

117
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,599
Take them into the VIP room
and I'll watch them from here.

118
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,519
Who are you? Big Brother?

119
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,919
The agreement was clear.
I won't deal with Neapolitans.

120
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,319
I won't deal...

121
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,039
You're very weird.

122
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,639
You don't drink, you don't fuck...

123
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,759
You live in a hotel that would disgust

124
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,999
even an Albanian whore.

125
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,839
You're scared of your fellow countrymen.

126
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,199
I don't know
what the fuck my father sees in you.

127
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,759
Now piss off.

128
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,759
Enzo!

129
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,919
Enzo's here.

130
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,679
Hi, Ciro.

131
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,439
Let me see the money.

132
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,639
Move it, Tatiana.

133
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,399
Hurry up.

134
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,759
What's the matter with the money?
Is there a problem?

135
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,279
Is something wrong?

136
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,719
I'll change it into leva for you.

137
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,879
Get back to work.

138
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,159
Mladen?

139
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,679
Their money's no good.

140
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,679
Are you calling me a fool?

141
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,799
You asked for my opinion
and I gave it to you.

142
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,039
Do what you want.

143
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,039
This fuckin' wop thinks

144
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,159
he can order me around.

145
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,079
You're going against me, huh?

146
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,599
They're friends of mine,
their money's good.

147
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:57,239
If it's good for you,
it's good for everyone.

148
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,119
Don't turn your back on me, fuck!

149
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,919
Come back here!

150
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,799
Listen up, moron.

151
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,159
Now you'll go back to my office,

152
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,599
you'll count the takings
like you always have.

153
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,479
And cut out all the bullshit, OK?
Now piss off!

154
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,759
Shitbag.

155
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,279
Get in.

156
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,239
Brother!

157
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,239
What are you doing in this shithole?

158
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,319
I'm not your brother.

159
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,479
What do we call you, Uncle?

160
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,959
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- What?

161
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,599
Are you kidding me?

162
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,479
Mladen said to wait for you here.

163
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,199
We've got the money in a car
parked at the airport, to be safe.

164
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,999
If you have problems, call him
and sort them out.

165
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,239
There are no problems.

166
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,239
Let's bounce.

167
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,559
Let's go.

168
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,119
How can you live here?

169
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,119
It's a place like any other.

170
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,919
I couldn't live away from Naples.

171
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,159
- Where's this parking structure?
- Wait a moment.

172
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,399
Holy mother...

173
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,559
Hurry up.

174
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,679
Turn left a bit further up,
where that sign is.

175
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,119
So you really learned their language?

176
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,799
Of course, he works here.

177
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,119
You've got a good head
on your shoulders.

178
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,359
I don't understand them when they talk,
they yap like dogs.

179
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,199
Let's hurry it up, I didn't come to chat.

180
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,799
Tell him where to go
and I'll follow.

181
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,919
I'm coming with you.

182
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,199
I'm glad.

183
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,159
Gimme the keys, I'll drive.

184
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,279
You know the way.

185
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,999
What the fuck's this one doing? Move!

186
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,359
Where's the money?

187
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,959
- What are you doing?
- It's fake.

188
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,479
The Saint said that only someone
who's worthless kills for money,

189
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,239
real men don't do it.

190
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,479
You have to figure out which is which.

191
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,639
Do you think there's a difference?

192
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:21,799
My family's done
what no one's ever done for Naples.

193
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,239
My grandfather performed miracles
like San Gennaro.

194
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,599
We created the System.

195
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,959
You understand my pedigree?

196
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,519
Say what you like, but if you're
not respectful, you're not a man.

197
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,759
If you want to screw someone,
first you gotta know them.

198
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,999
But you didn't consider who I am,
you underestimated me.

199
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,039
And now you've got a problem.

200
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,999
Your grandfather would never have
ended up in a shitty situation like this.

201
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,279
If you're gonna shoot, shoot.

202
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,239
I won't kill you,

203
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,399
but you gotta tell me the truth.

204
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,199
Call your friends, get them
to pick you up and go back to Naples.

205
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,759
I don't want to see you ever again.

206
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,239
If you get homesick one day,

207
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,079
remember, in Forcella
we make the best pizza in Naples.

208
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,559
Are the five kilos of heroin ready
for our Neapolitan clients?

209
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,439
Quick!

210
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,079
Put it in.

211
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,919
Put it in.

212
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,759
Hi, Ciro.

213
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,399
There's a car outside full of money,
it's the Neapolitans'.

214
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,879
Did they buy the stuff?

215
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,879
I didn't give it to them
because their cash was fake,

216
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,959
but that's not the biggest problem.

217
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,839
They made a deal with Mladen.

218
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,679
A deal?
For what? I don't understand.

219
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,519
Mladen called them,

220
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,039
he asked them to bring fake bills.

221
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,359
He said if they brought 100,000 in fake
euros, he'd give them the stuff for free.

222
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,199
Why?

223
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,159
To frame me, to make it seem
like I was in on it with them

224
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,879
and to screw me.

225
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,719
Do you think you're worth 100,000 euros
to my son?

226
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,719
I'm not worth that.
You're worth that for your son.

227
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,479
He's convinced I want to take his place.

228
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,719
If I didn't have a son,
I'd want one like you,

229
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,159
but I've already got a son, Ciro.

230
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,919
I'm sorry.

231
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,519
Me too.

232
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,359
If I had a son

233
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,879
I'd tell him to his face

234
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,439
when he's being an arsehole.

235
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,839
Out. Out!

236
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,919
- Hi, Ciro.
- Hello.

237
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,959
The fuck are you waiting for?

238
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,719
Get in.

239
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,359
Quick!

240
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,919
Get down.

241
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,799
I don't understand.

242
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,639
It's the same thing.

243
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:50,639
MACEDONIA-ALBANIA BORDER

244
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,319
Be good.

245
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,919
COMING UP

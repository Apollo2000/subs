266

280

00:43:26,196 --> 00:43:28,714
<font color="#ffff00"><b>Three things have to be sacred
for all of us.</b></font>

284
00:43:28,716 --> 00:43:32,114
<font color="#ffff00"><b>The first: Secondigliano
has to be independent,</b></font>

285
00:43:32,116 --> 00:43:34,834
<font color="#ffff00"><b>not under the control
of the other clans.</b></font>

286
00:43:34,836 --> 00:43:39,435
<font color="#ffff00"><b>I will guarantee that Secondigliano will
not make any requests in your areas.</b></font>

287
00:43:40,715 --> 00:43:44,595
<font color="#ffff00"><b>The second:
enough with wars.</b></font>

288
00:43:46,075 --> 00:43:50,272
<font color="#ffff00"><b>Wars are bad for everybody,
and especially for business.</b></font>

289
00:43:50,274 --> 00:43:52,792
<font color="#ffff00"><b>The cops need to forget our faces,</b></font>

290
00:43:52,794 --> 00:43:55,912
<font color="#ffff00"><b>for them we all need

291
00:43:55,914 --> 00:43:58,954

and never will be.</b></font>

292
00:44:00,873 --> 00:44:04,751
<font color="#ffff00"><b>The third: whoever wants to do business
with Secondigliano is welcome.</b></font>

293
00:44:04,753 --> 00:44:06,671
<font color="#ffff00"><b>The price will be the same for everybody</b></font>

294
00:44:06,673 --> 00:44:10,793
<font color="#ffff00"><b>and everybody will sell at the same
agreed price in their area.</b></font>

295
00:44:11,953 --> 00:44:14,112
<font color="#ffff00"><b>That way there is no competition.</b></font>

296
00:44:15,712 --> 00:44:17,632
<font color="#ffff00"><b>And what do you earn?</b></font>

297
00:44:22,352 --> 00:44:25,549
<font color="#ffff00"><b>Freedom,</b></font>

298
00:44:25,551 --> 00:44:27,869
<font color="#ffff00"><b>for me and for my family.</b></font>

299
00:44:27,871 --> 00:44:30,071
<font color="#ffff00"><b>What does that mean?</b></font>

300
00:44:31,951 --> 00:44:35,031
<font color="#ffff00"><b>That from tomorrow in Secondigliano
Donna Patrizia is in charge.</b></font>

301
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:50,107
<font color="#ffff00"><b>Only a woman can raise a child properly.</b></font>

302
00:44:50,109 --> 00:44:54,027
<font color="#ffff00"><b>And this peace is like a child,</b></font>

303
00:44:54,029 --> 00:44:56,787

304
00:44:56,789 --> 00:44:59,229
<font color="#ffff00"><b>and Gerlando Levante as its father.</b></font>

305
00:45:03,108 --> 00:45:06,946
<font color="#ffff00"><b>Nothing changes for you,
Patrizia has my suppliers.</b></font>

306
00:45:06,948 --> 00:45:09,468
<font color="#ffff00"><b>You pay her

307
00:45:14,267 --> 00:45:16,467

308
00:45:21,347 --> 00:45:23,227

310
00:45:42,185 --> 00:45:44,585
<font color="#ffff00"><b>I wish you all good luck.</b></font>

312
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,500

316
00:47:26,736 --> 00:47:29,616
<font color="#ffff00"><b>for everybody else,
it's not worth anything now.</b></font>

317

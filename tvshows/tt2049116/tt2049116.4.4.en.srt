LONDON

3
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:27,845
Hi, Alberto.
- Hi.

4
00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:33,339
Did you call your friend?
- First thing I did.

5
00:03:33,476 --> 00:03:35,849
What did she say?
- It's all set up.

6
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:38,594
Leena will get it done, you'll see.

7
00:03:38,715 --> 00:03:40,780
I've known her for 15 years,
she's a Mack truck.

8
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:44,149
Now she's gone into business
with a genius of finance

9
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:48,348
and I checked their acquisitions
over recent years, all blue chip.

10
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,321
Thank you.

11
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,327
Gennaro, you need to relax.

12
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:14,386
I need to relax, Alberto?

13
00:04:15,426 --> 00:04:18,758
All I know is until a few days ago
everything was going well,

14
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,217
now if I don't buy an international
company in two weeks,

15
00:04:21,337 --> 00:04:23,850
like fuck I'll open the airport.

16
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:29,241
That's not a good thing,
neither for me nor for you.

17
00:04:29,362 --> 00:04:31,651
Don't ever forget that.

18
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,498
Hello?

19
00:04:46,498 --> 00:04:48,166
Good.

20
00:04:50,218 --> 00:04:52,444
They've arrived.

21
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:14,691
Get it done now,
we don't have a minute to lose.

22
00:05:21,927 --> 00:05:24,554
See you here in an hour.
- Right.

23
00:05:39,646 --> 00:05:41,620
<font color="#ffff00">Hello.
- Gennaro Savastano.</font>

24
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,368
<font color="#ffff00">Ah, Mr. Savastano. Our bank manager,
Mr. Cormack is waiting for you.</font>

25
00:05:47,663 --> 00:05:50,787
<font color="#ffff00">Mr. Savastano,
it's a pleasure to meet you.</font>

26
00:05:50,908 --> 00:05:53,044
<font color="#ffff00">This way, please.</font>

27
00:07:10,205 --> 00:07:12,526
<font color="#ffff00">So, Mr. Savastano...</font>

28
00:07:12,646 --> 00:07:16,603
<font color="#ffff00">You put in your personal code,
and here is your key card.</font>

29
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:20,129
<font color="#ffff00">If you need anything else, let me know.</font>

30
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,372
Thank you.

31
00:08:11,831 --> 00:08:12,934
<font color="#ffff00">Hello.</font>

32
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,769
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you.
- Thank you.</font>

33
00:08:29,002 --> 00:08:31,236
<font color="#ffff00">Leena!
- Alberto!</font>

34
00:08:31,609 --> 00:08:34,858
<font color="#ffff00">I'm so glad to see you.
This is the person I told you about,</font>

35
00:08:34,978 --> 00:08:37,590
<font color="#ffff00">my partner, Mr. Gennaro Savastano.</font>

36
00:08:39,856 --> 00:08:42,858
<font color="#ffff00">Lovely to meet you.
- Please sit down.</font>

37
00:08:46,832 --> 00:08:49,585
<font color="#ffff00">Do you want something? A coffee?
- No, thank you.</font>

38
00:08:49,706 --> 00:08:51,811
<font color="#ffff00">I found what you asked for.</font>

39
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,542
<font color="#ffff00">Or rather, my partner, Patrick did.</font>

40
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:58,760
<font color="#ffff00">He's fantastic. But,
given the short notice, it wasn't easy.</font>

41
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:01,129
<font color="#ffff00">In the end, we were lucky.</font>

42
00:09:02,055 --> 00:09:05,747
<font color="#ffff00">Anyway... I'm sure
that you're in a hurry, so... shall we go?</font>

43
00:09:06,023 --> 00:09:09,457
<font color="#ffff00">Patrick's waiting for us at the office
with more details.</font>

44
00:09:09,578 --> 00:09:12,755
He said that Patrick...
- I understood.

45
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:20,660
<font color="#ffff00">Let's go.</font>

46
00:09:38,133 --> 00:09:40,062
<font color="#ffff00">It's this-this way.</font>

47
00:09:42,574 --> 00:09:44,392
<font color="#ffff00">Hey, guys.
- Hi.</font>

48
00:09:44,413 --> 00:09:46,036
<font color="#ffff00">Patrick...</font>

49
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:51,789
<font color="#ffff00">Patrick Calvis, it's a pleasure.</font>

50
00:09:51,909 --> 00:09:53,935
Gennaro Savastano.

51
00:09:54,056 --> 00:09:55,403
<font color="#ffff00">Patrick.
- Alberto Resta,</font>

52
00:09:55,523 --> 00:09:56,699
<font color="#ffff00">Pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.</font>

53
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:58,579
<font color="#ffff00">Please come in, take a seat.</font>

54
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:01,256
<font color="#ffff00">Can I get anyone a coffee?
- No, thank you.</font>

55
00:10:01,277 --> 00:10:02,917
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, please.</font>

56
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,645
<font color="#ffff00">Harry?</font>

57
00:10:05,693 --> 00:10:10,127
<font color="#ffff00">So Leena tells me you've just
a couple of weeks to close the deal.</font>

58
00:10:10,248 --> 00:10:12,495
<font color="#ffff00">Let's get straight to the point, sir.</font>

59
00:10:22,276 --> 00:10:23,415
Wimpro.

60
00:10:23,535 --> 00:10:25,540
<font color="#ffff00">Market value: Â£20 million.</font>

61
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,008
<font color="#ffff00">The price is not an issue.</font>

62
00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:44,315
<font color="#ffff00">Well... well, Patrick...
But...</font>

63
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,724
<font color="#ffff00">if it's so, why do they need to sell?</font>

64
00:10:46,845 --> 00:10:50,166
<font color="#ffff00">In the past year,
Wimpro made some bad investments.</font>

65
00:10:50,286 --> 00:10:52,399
<font color="#ffff00">Not through it's own fault,</font>

66
00:10:52,648 --> 00:10:56,316
<font color="#ffff00">now, they've been exposed and
they need to close a contract ASAP.</font>

67
00:10:56,437 --> 00:11:00,016
<font color="#ffff00">But... they haven't got the
money to do so all by themselves.</font>

68
00:11:00,236 --> 00:11:04,998
<font color="#ffff00">So, apparently...
Wimpro need you more than you need them.</font>

69
00:11:05,271 --> 00:11:07,716
<font color="#ffff00">We just have to let them know.</font>

70
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:10,116
<font color="#ffff00">Now, it's up to you.</font>

71
00:11:11,635 --> 00:11:14,955
Did you get that,
or do I have to translate?

72
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:38,603
Well? How's it going?

73
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,657
For the moment, everything's okay.

74
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:48,908
Here's Gaetano.

75
00:11:49,028 --> 00:11:53,018
Who's that?
- A person who works for me in London.

76
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:56,159
Welcome, Mrs. Savastano.
- Thank you.

77
00:11:59,867 --> 00:12:02,701
Do you think it's good?

78
00:12:06,532 --> 00:12:09,518
We have to go home
with an international company

79
00:12:09,638 --> 00:12:11,742
to head up the consortium

80
00:12:11,862 --> 00:12:15,924
or else Casillo's friend won't give us
the contract for the airport.

81
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,342
So you've already decided?

82
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:30,615
<font color="#ffff00">For you, madam.
- Thank you.</font>

83
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,514
<font color="#ffff00">And for you, sir.</font>

84
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:35,609
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

85
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:47,396
They asked me
to make an irrevocable bid.

86
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:52,081
An irrevocable bid?

87
00:12:56,926 --> 00:12:59,041
And I did.

88
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,720
This city has always
made me feel anxious.

89
00:13:54,263 --> 00:13:56,238
Me too.

90
00:14:22,092 --> 00:14:23,853
<font color="#ffff00">Is everything okay?
- Not really.</font>

91
00:14:23,973 --> 00:14:25,480
<font color="#ffff00">We have a problem.
- What's happened?</font>

92
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,693
<font color="#ffff00">The owners, the Mayers family
have asked for a partners meeting.</font>

93
00:14:28,814 --> 00:14:33,667
<font color="#ffff00">It's starting as we speak. We're going
to try, to get the others, to reject your offer.</font>

94
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:37,495
The owners want to reject the offer.

95
00:14:37,616 --> 00:14:40,944
Can they do that?
- If they convince the majority, yes.

96
00:14:41,065 --> 00:14:44,693
<font color="#ffff00">Patrick's there already.
You need to try to convince them.</font>

97
00:14:44,814 --> 00:14:47,022
<font color="#ffff00">My car's waiting outside.</font>

98
00:14:59,918 --> 00:15:02,308
<font color="#ffff00">It's here.
Go to the back entrance.</font>

99
00:15:05,246 --> 00:15:07,475
<font color="#ffff00">You're not allowed
into the shareholders meeting.</font>

100
00:15:07,595 --> 00:15:09,774
<font color="#ffff00">We can't walk in the front door.</font>

101
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:58,239
<font color="#ffff00">Apparently, the meeting hasn't started yet.
It'll be a couple of minutes.</font>

102
00:16:37,392 --> 00:16:39,896
<font color="#ffff00">Did you see those
two men I was talking to?</font>

103
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,568
<font color="#ffff00">They are the men we need to persuade.</font>

104
00:16:42,788 --> 00:16:44,972
<font color="#ffff00">They belong to the
anti-Mayers faction.</font>

105
00:16:45,192 --> 00:16:48,210
<font color="#ffff00">They claim the Mayers'
management has damaged the business.</font>

106
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,964
<font color="#ffff00">They hold 7% and 5% respectively.</font>

107
00:16:52,384 --> 00:16:56,393
<font color="#ffff00">They can convince the other 39%
to sell to you.</font>

108
00:16:56,713 --> 00:16:59,706
<font color="#ffff00">So we need them on our side.
- Definitely.</font>

109
00:17:10,951 --> 00:17:12,671
Azzurra?

110
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:15,638
I sent you a message
with the instructions.

111
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,965
Gaetano is coming to get you.

112
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,793
Haven't they arrived yet?
- No. Did you bring them?

113
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:05,004
They're here. Good morning, Alberto.
- Good morning.

114
00:18:09,761 --> 00:18:11,826
Want a coffee?
- No.

115
00:18:11,947 --> 00:18:14,084
It's disgusting anyway.

116
00:18:20,514 --> 00:18:21,929
<font color="#ffff00">Good afternoon.
- Hello, Leena.</font>

117
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,585
<font color="#ffff00">Hello.</font>

118
00:18:24,793 --> 00:18:27,936
<font color="#ffff00">John Millivan, Bernard Edgewood.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">- Please, have a seat.</font>

119
00:18:28,056 --> 00:18:31,820
<font color="#ffff00">I'd like to present Alberto Resta,
Gennaro Savastano</font>

120
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:33,949
<font color="#ffff00">and Azzurra Avitabile.</font>

121
00:18:34,131 --> 00:18:36,396
<font color="#ffff00">Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.</font>

122
00:18:36,517 --> 00:18:39,091
<font color="#ffff00">So... our project...</font>

123
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:44,218
<font color="#ffff00">is to build the biggest airport
ever built on Italian soil.</font>

124
00:18:45,629 --> 00:18:47,032
<font color="#ffff00">Yours...</font>

125
00:18:47,152 --> 00:18:51,983
<font color="#ffff00">is to get rid of... of the leadership
who doesn't go anywhere.</font>

126
00:18:53,015 --> 00:18:55,027
<font color="#ffff00">What do you think about?</font>

127
00:18:57,883 --> 00:18:59,617
<font color="#ffff00">Be practical.</font>

128
00:19:01,048 --> 00:19:03,109
<font color="#ffff00">We know your business
is in trouble.</font>

129
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,827
<font color="#ffff00">If you don't close a contract
in the next few months,</font>

130
00:19:05,947 --> 00:19:09,012
<font color="#ffff00">you risk going bankrupt
and losing everything.</font>

131
00:19:09,202 --> 00:19:12,927
<font color="#ffff00">On the other hand, we have
the opportunity to close one of the biggest</font>

132
00:19:13,047 --> 00:19:15,544
<font color="#ffff00">infrastructure projects in Italy.</font>

133
00:19:15,665 --> 00:19:18,111
<font color="#ffff00">But to do so,
we need a company like yours.</font>

134
00:19:18,231 --> 00:19:20,970
<font color="#ffff00">It's a win-win situation.
You just have to say yes.</font>

135
00:19:21,183 --> 00:19:25,532
<font color="#ffff00">And convince your associates...
to accept our offer.</font>

136
00:19:26,686 --> 00:19:30,113
<font color="#ffff00">It's not for free... of course.</font>

137
00:20:02,606 --> 00:20:05,018
<font color="#ffff00">I've spoken to the board.</font>

138
00:20:05,979 --> 00:20:08,568
<font color="#ffff00">You are, now, the majority owner.</font>

139
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,921
<font color="#ffff00">They have accepted your bid.</font>

140
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:13,626
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you.
- Congratulations.</font>

141
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:15,994
<font color="#ffff00">Congratulations, Alberto.
- Thank you.</font>

142
00:20:25,978 --> 00:20:28,298
You're already up?

143
00:20:30,194 --> 00:20:32,216
I'll help you.

144
00:20:36,478 --> 00:20:38,984
I'm proud of you, Gennaro.

145
00:20:43,872 --> 00:20:46,572
See you later at the office?

146
00:20:55,845 --> 00:20:57,514
Well?

147
00:20:59,052 --> 00:21:01,870
Good one, Gaetano.
I'll be right down.

148
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:19,146
<font color="#ffff00">Everything is fine.</font>

149
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,679
<font color="#ffff00">It's done. It's real now.</font>

150
00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:26,280
<font color="#ffff00">Leena, could you send us all
the documents by mail today please?</font>

151
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,416
<font color="#ffff00">We need them
for our associates for a fast check.</font>

152
00:22:29,537 --> 00:22:32,203
<font color="#ffff00">Of course. Leena, you can do that?
- Of course.</font>

153
00:22:32,293 --> 00:22:34,026
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you.</font>

154
00:22:46,244 --> 00:22:48,334
Michele...

155
00:22:48,455 --> 00:22:50,400
we did it.

156
00:22:51,407 --> 00:22:53,458
The paperwork's on its way to you,

157
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:57,712
check immediately that it's all okay,
before we go to the notary.

158
00:22:58,533 --> 00:23:01,118
I need to know straightaway.

159
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,484
Thanks.

160
00:23:19,604 --> 00:23:21,157
Cheers!

161
00:23:22,955 --> 00:23:24,990
Check this out, Alberto.

162
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:28,381
What is it?
- Dunno.

163
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:30,508
Looks good, though.

164
00:23:39,524 --> 00:23:41,219
It's Casillo.

165
00:23:41,902 --> 00:23:43,683
Michele.

166
00:23:44,863 --> 00:23:46,863
I can't hear you.

167
00:23:48,108 --> 00:23:49,812
Now I can.

168
00:23:56,145 --> 00:23:58,036
What?

169
00:24:06,662 --> 00:24:09,006
I'll take care of it now.

170
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:12,391
What did he say?

171
00:24:14,517 --> 00:24:16,275
There's a document missing,

172
00:24:16,396 --> 00:24:21,013
the banks' approval
for the transfer of ownership.

173
00:24:21,373 --> 00:24:24,628
Wimpro has three lines of credit
with three different banks.

174
00:24:24,748 --> 00:24:27,919
They have to give permission
when ownership changes.

175
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,451
But it's a formality,
they must have forgotten.

176
00:24:30,571 --> 00:24:33,539
I'll call Leena,
they'll be at the office.

177
00:24:43,365 --> 00:24:45,392
Her phone's switched off, that's odd.

178
00:24:45,512 --> 00:24:47,559
I'll try Patrick.

179
00:24:47,841 --> 00:24:49,903
Put your shoes on.

180
00:24:54,349 --> 00:24:56,638
Patrick's is switched off, too...

181
00:24:58,767 --> 00:25:01,355
It'll be quicker to go in person.

182
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,112
Be careful, Azzurra.

183
00:26:40,467 --> 00:26:42,918
I called Wimpro's headquarters.

184
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:47,624
They don't know who we are,
they've never even heard of us.

185
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:52,101
It was all fake.

186
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,934
Gennaro, that's not possible.

187
00:26:56,154 --> 00:26:59,953
I've known Leena for 15 years,
she's always been legit.

188
00:27:00,074 --> 00:27:04,632
I checked her company:
the accounts, acquisitions, contracts.

189
00:27:05,152 --> 00:27:07,892
There has to be another explanation.

190
00:27:13,904 --> 00:27:16,659
There's shit everywhere,

191
00:27:16,841 --> 00:27:19,637
it just has different colors.

192
00:27:19,758 --> 00:27:21,708
There's your explanation.

193
00:27:34,107 --> 00:27:35,904
We have two advantages,

194
00:27:36,024 --> 00:27:41,081
the first is that they weren't
expecting us to find out so soon,

195
00:27:41,501 --> 00:27:45,624
the second is that I know more
than they think.

196
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:03,564
Gennaro, I swear,

197
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:06,350
I'm not involved.

198
00:28:16,785 --> 00:28:19,356
I know you're not...

199
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:22,130
but do me a favor.

200
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:24,797
Whatever you want.

201
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:32,237
From now on, just keep
that fucking mouth of yours shut.

202
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:37,273
Let's go.

203
00:29:18,597 --> 00:29:20,579
<font color="#ffff00">Hello.
- Hello.</font>

204
00:29:28,176 --> 00:29:29,910
<font color="#ffff00">Hello, momma.</font>

205
00:29:32,582 --> 00:29:34,808
<font color="#ffff00">I found the Grevillea.</font>

206
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:41,322
<font color="#ffff00">How are you to...</font>

207
00:29:48,506 --> 00:29:50,650
<font color="#ffff00">Please don't hurt her.</font>

208
00:29:54,851 --> 00:29:57,179
See, Ma'am? Leena's here.

209
00:29:58,034 --> 00:29:59,568
<font color="#ffff00">Please.</font>

210
00:30:02,115 --> 00:30:05,164
Only I knew. I could feel it.

211
00:30:08,988 --> 00:30:12,334
That's why I had you followed
the other night.

212
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:19,584
I've fucking had it with this game!

213
00:30:22,472 --> 00:30:24,905
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</font>

214
00:30:26,597 --> 00:30:29,692
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry. I'm really...
I'm sorry.</font>

215
00:30:32,382 --> 00:30:35,546
We're all so predictable, so petty.

216
00:30:40,812 --> 00:30:44,913
We all have someone important
we'd do anything for,

217
00:30:45,215 --> 00:30:47,535
even something really fucking stupid.

218
00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:54,406
I knew you couldn't leave without
saying goodbye to your mom.

219
00:30:56,712 --> 00:30:59,142
Right, Leena?

220
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:08,568
<font color="#ffff00">Where is my gold?</font>

221
00:31:10,637 --> 00:31:12,202
<font color="#ffff00">It's...</font>

222
00:31:12,323 --> 00:31:14,533
<font color="#ffff00">in the warehouse.</font>

223
00:31:15,438 --> 00:31:17,868
<font color="#ffff00">But I don't have a key.</font>

224
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:22,413
<font color="#ffff00">And where is the key?</font>

225
00:31:23,032 --> 00:31:25,915
<font color="#ffff00">I don't have it. I don't have it.</font>

226
00:31:28,069 --> 00:31:29,205
<font color="#ffff00">No?</font>

227
00:31:29,325 --> 00:31:31,123
<font color="#ffff00">Patrick...</font>

228
00:32:18,085 --> 00:32:20,069
Check there.

229
00:33:05,407 --> 00:33:07,782
What the fuck have you done?

230
00:33:10,837 --> 00:33:12,467
Is he dead?

231
00:33:13,569 --> 00:33:17,184
Yes.
- I needed him alive, asshole!

232
00:33:21,753 --> 00:33:24,279
Go and see if anyone's coming.

233
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,067
The piece.

234
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,719
Motherfuckers...

235
00:33:54,064 --> 00:33:57,375
We gotta make him disappear.
Take the arms, hurry.

236
00:34:54,431 --> 00:34:56,483
Our gold is here.

237
00:35:03,403 --> 00:35:07,450
If we hadn't made it in time
tonight it was headed to Singapore.

238
00:35:44,195 --> 00:35:46,115
Come, Gaetano.

239
00:35:55,418 --> 00:35:57,919
See, there's a door.

240
00:36:00,813 --> 00:36:02,880
Is the gold there?

241
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:37,240
Leena...
Love makes people act crazy.

242
00:36:38,156 --> 00:36:41,119
Now that I've found my gold,
I'm happier,

243
00:36:41,624 --> 00:36:44,073
so I'll give you another chance.

244
00:36:44,293 --> 00:36:46,576
Untie her.

245
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:17,051
I came to London
because I had a problem

246
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:19,871
and now you have to solve it for me

247
00:37:20,022 --> 00:37:22,356
unless you wanna end up
like your friend.

248
00:37:22,477 --> 00:37:25,425
You have 36 hours,
Gaetano will be your shadow.

249
00:37:25,649 --> 00:37:27,693
You understand?

250
00:37:30,306 --> 00:37:32,411
Alberto, come here.

251
00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:36,309
Come here!

252
00:37:45,629 --> 00:37:47,410
Translate.

253
00:37:49,371 --> 00:37:52,803
Come,
let's call them straightaway.

254
00:38:32,783 --> 00:38:34,318
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you.</font>

255
00:38:50,796 --> 00:38:51,854
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you.</font>

256
00:38:51,975 --> 00:38:53,891
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you so much.</font>

257
00:39:11,562 --> 00:39:14,229
I really missed
our little lamb chop so much.

258
00:39:15,623 --> 00:39:17,995
I missed him, too.

259
00:39:18,115 --> 00:39:20,438
I really missed
being in my own home.

260
00:39:23,913 --> 00:39:28,649
But now we're back
and we have the company we needed.

261
00:39:35,744 --> 00:39:40,288
In the end, Alberto was right,
Leena was really useful.

262
00:40:21,581 --> 00:40:26,472

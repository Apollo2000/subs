1
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,400
Please, help me.

2
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,990
- What happened?
- Help.

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,910
They robbed and dumped me
and now my car doesn't start.

4
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,470
Freeze, asshole.

5
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,230
Hold it, get back.

6
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,920
Get back, look in front of you.

7
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,840
Look in front of you.

8
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,560
Get in.

9
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,760
Close the door.

10
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,030
Well done.

11
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,200
- I have to go, Carmela is looking for me.
- Okay, go.

12
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,680
This is finished.

13
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,790
- These are better than the real ones.
- Ah well, those Chinese don't understand.

14
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,590
No, they do. They're so smart
they can learn the trade everywhere.

15
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,390
You're stupid. They all look the same.

16
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,880
They don't even recognize each other,
let alone their drills.

17
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,550
That Chinese girl who's working
for my uncle, I recognize her very well.

18
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,150
Her pussy, you mean.

19
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,600
I'll cut your head off. Get lost.

20
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,640
Two, four, five... That's fifteen.

21
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,400
Can I have your wallet?

22
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,440
Pasquale...

23
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,670
If you report this,
you don't remember me. Right?

24
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,440
You don't want me to come over.

25
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,920
Buy a dress for your wife from this.

26
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,480
Translated by: NederSubs.

27
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,240
They beat you up pretty badly.

28
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,440
Why are you back?

29
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,680
I got homesick.

30
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,400
But this is no longer our home.

31
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,640
The city spit us out.

32
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,150
They kicked me out of Secondigliano
like a garbage bag.

33
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,800
Me.

34
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,400
They all have to die.

35
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,240
Where are Azzurra and Pietro?

36
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,720
Deborah was right.

37
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,910
The last night I saw her...

38
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,040
she said: "Stop it, Ciro."

39
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,240
Think about us."

40
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,160
But I didn't listen.

41
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,280
I had to go through hell
to understand that.

42
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,720
After all what they've done to us,
we're still there.

43
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,680
Just you and me.

44
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,760
You have to win them back.

45
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,720
If you do it for them,
I'll have your back.

46
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,190
Hey, handsome.

47
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,240
- Blue Blood, everything okay?
- Yes, luckily.

48
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,200
- Everything alright?
- Definitely.

49
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,190
These just came in.

50
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,720
- Show me.
- You want to see them?

51
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,830
- Let's try it.
- I also have these at home.

52
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:53,880
The only thing I didn't pierce is
my sister's head. It's rock hard.

53
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,600
Fortunately, our walls are made of shit.

54
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,510
We're already happy
when it's a Western brand.

55
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,520
I'll take them.

56
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,120
Guys, load it up.

57
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,040
Come, I want to show you something.

58
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,590
- This is 80,000, we are even.
- There was no rush.

59
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,520
Someone like you has to see
that I'm good for my money.

60
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,190
What do you think?

61
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,230
Not bad.

62
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,680
This must have cost a fortune.

63
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,560
Only the purchase costs are high.

64
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,160
There's even a sprinkler system
with temperature control.

65
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,630
So this is your business. And?

66
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,360
There is something bigger,
do you know what?

67
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,550
The emotional investment.

68
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,270
You need your brains
if you want to keep dealing.

69
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,670
To keep these, you need this.

70
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,310
I've learned to love these plants.

71
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,910
I know exactly how to grow them.

72
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,840
After 3 weeks you need this light, after 6
another light, after 9 another light again.

73
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,560
- Why are the lights off now, then?
- They're sleeping now.

74
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,150
Everything is controlled by a timer.

75
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,470
At twelve o'clock
everything turns back on.

76
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,880
How do you know
when they wake up and go to sleep?

77
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,840
I know them well.

78
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,070
What do you want to be
when you grow up, Enzo?

79
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,680
A farmer?

80
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,800
Or do you really want to do
something big, as you said?

81
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,280
I want to grow.

82
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,360
I've been thinking.

83
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,110
If you want to earn big money,
you have to listen to me.

84
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,720
You'll have to do everything I say.

85
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,400
One coffee.

86
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,320
One coffee, please.

87
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,190
The money is collected
one minute after closing time.

88
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,320
I'll pay for him.

89
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,840
This is vacant because it's unsafe.

90
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,840
- We're going in here.
- And what if it collapses?

91
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,950
If it collapses after us,
it doesn't matter.

92
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,840
- We'll take a different exit anyway.
- Why?

93
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,990
If you want to survive, you must always
be one step ahead of your pursuers.

94
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,320
We don't only want to survive.

95
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,840
That'll come later.

96
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,870
Here's were we get out.

97
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,910
On the square, behind the market.

98
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:48,040
And we need weapons,
but you have to arrange those. Clear?

99
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,840
Here, boys.

100
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,840
And?

101
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,280
I think the boys are ready.

102
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,680
Already?

103
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,870
They're like how we used to be.

104
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,840
They're hungry.

105
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,480
That is what we need.

106
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,320
Open it.

107
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,240
What's happening?

108
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,350
Face down.

109
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,960
Hurry up.

110
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,590
Faster.

111
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,240
Hurry.

112
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,400
Take this.

113
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,120
Hurry up.

114
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,000
- Come on.
- Hurry up, open the bag.

115
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,990
- Get them out of here.
- Come with me.

116
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,400
Everybody on the ground.

117
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,390
- Only 1 minute and 40 seconds left. Hurry.
- Faster.

118
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,310
- We don't have all day.
- One second.

119
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,430
- We need to go.
- Go.

120
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,240
We're done, put it in.

121
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,760
Go.

122
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,240
Go.

123
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,200
Quickly.

124
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,800
I'll hear how it goes.

125
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,840
I swear to you, he was shitting himself.

126
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,720
This is really a lot of money.

127
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,280
Look at that.

128
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,630
Hey guys.

129
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,320
We did it.

130
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,280
Quiet.

131
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,200
Are you satisfied?

132
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,800
What do you want to do with this money?

133
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,760
Split it and spend it?

134
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:09,360
And then start again?
That's what bank robbers do.

135
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,240
Not people who want to grow.

136
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:22,880
People who want to grow need to
invest their money to become stronger.

137
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,560
What do you want to be?

138
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,200
That's what you have to decide.

139
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,200
Brother.

140
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,960
Now we can begin.

141
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,640
I'm tired of being a waitress.
It's not my thing.

142
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,080
Just hang on a bit longer,
do it for her.

143
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,270
Does she know what you're doing?

144
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,350
I do what's best for all of us.

145
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,640
I know that, but your sister doesn't.

146
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,430
And she is not crazy.

147
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,360
You have to tell her.

148
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,400
Where did you get that from?

149
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,630
And don't say it's the weed that you
sell on the streets. This is too much.

150
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,600
I committed a robbery.

151
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,990
- Really?
- Don't worry, no one saw it.

152
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Now the city
can pay for your porch.

153
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,190
But you have to stop now.

154
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,200
I'm already bringing food packages to my
husband. Soon you'll be in jail, too.

155
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,200
Carmela, I'll bring the boy home.

156
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,480
You and Cosimo are my life.

157
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,920
Have a seat.

158
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,480
Thank you for having me.

159
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,320
We have good memories of your father,
we did some good business.

160
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,000
I would like to continue that.
We have good memories of your father,
we did some good business.

161
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,560
I would like to continue that.

162
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,260
This is 366,000 euros, to start with.

163
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,030
We can do it for 33 per kilo.

164
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,960
- Special price.
- Okay.

165
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,920
When is the delivery?

166
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,160
Tomorrow.

167
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,320
Fine.

168
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:54,270
This stuff is still good
after adulterating four times.

169
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:59,430
We cut it twice. Our stuff
should be the best on the market.

170
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,910
They have to see it's better right away,
so they'll come to us.

171
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,240
- And our price?
- Lower than theirs.

172
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,670
Sorry, but then we don't make profit.

173
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,430
Right now, it's the only way.

174
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,480
This is key, the market share.

175
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,720
Once the others are gone,
we can do what we want.

176
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,040
Hey, buddy.

177
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,030
- You wanted to meet him?
- Yes, indeed.

178
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,910
- Are you Valerio?
- Yes, do you want something to drink?

179
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:59,630
- Later. Can we talk first?
- Of course.

180
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,560
I'll be right back.

181
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,390
I heard your weed sales
are through the roof.

182
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,200
There's a high demand.

183
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,240
If we can deliver more,
would you be up for it?

184
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,310
We can also supply coke.

185
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,920
- How much?
- As much as you want.

186
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,630
I was hoping you would say that.

187
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,040
Do you hear how formally he speaks?

188
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,720
How about we call him Vocabulary?

189
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,520
It suits him perfectly.

190
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,480
You're now one of us, Vocabulary.

191
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,480
Hello, how are you?

192
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,830
Brother.

193
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,870
You were right,
we haven't been on the streets.

194
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,200
We're screwing them
and they don't what's hitting them.

195
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,190
They'll find out today or tomorrow.

196
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,670
We must be ready for it.

197
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,840
Do you even know who they are?

198
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,750
Do you remember who you are?

199
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,880
Or did you forget that?

200
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,520
This place is crawling with Ciros.

201
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:20,200
But you're no ordinary Ciro,
you're the Immortal from Secondigliano.

202
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,000
The Immortal is dead.

203
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,080
But that was you, right?

204
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,400
Is that really important?

205
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,800
Blue Blood.
That is me, no more and no less.

206
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,880
If I need to fight for you, I want
to know who you are and who you were.

207
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,280
That was my name.

208
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,320
The enemy of the Republic
must disband the army...

209
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,280
Look at me.

210
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,160
By confiscating...

211
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,590
the weapons.

212
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,880
If you fail, you're in for it.

213
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,080
- What are you doing?
- Nothing, why?

214
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,630
They'll only tolerate you here
if you sell some weed on the streets.

215
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:01,590
But your attitude has changed, lately.
And I don't like that.

216
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,150
My neck hurts from all that bowing.

217
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:08,720
You and I are only alive because
Mom asked Don Arenella for mercy.

218
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,070
- Never forget that.
- Mom didn't feel well then.

219
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,840
I was 14 when I had to bury Mom.

220
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:22,510
I promised Don Arenella that it was over.
I have to keep that promise.

221
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,230
A man keeps his word.

222
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,000
You're not a man.

223
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,920
But I was.
I was the man of the house.

224
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,550
The man and the mother.

225
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,510
First yours, now Cosimo's. Because
you don't have the patience for it.

226
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,270
It's your promise,
but I'm stuck with it.

227
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:47,750
- There wasn't even a good reason for it.
- It's what Mom wanted.

228
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,430
And it saved us.

229
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,230
But you don't care.
You don't respect anyone or anything.

230
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,920
They killed Dad and didn't even
left a body we could bury.

231
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,440
We are children of ghosts...

232
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,630
and ghosts are restless.

233
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,960
But war is even worse:

234
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,680
You know where it starts,
but not where it ends.

235
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,000
NEXT TIME

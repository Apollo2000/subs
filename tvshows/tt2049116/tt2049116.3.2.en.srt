00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:24,060
ONE YEAR LATER

2
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:50,610
Banks should be helping out
in times of crisis like this.

3
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,020
I understand the exposed checks
amount to 80,000 euros for this month's end.

4
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,780
I'm steering by sight,
it's all I can do.

5
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,340
I think you can choose a more quiet course.

6
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,860
This property has its own prestige after all.

7
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:17,060
I know someone interested in the investment,
I think we can find a solution.

8
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,060
Gennà!
- Hi, Gegè.

9
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,460
So?
- He gave it up, it's ours.

10
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,620
Good.

11
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,500
This time the payment
must be before the selling.

12
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,780
What's the problem?
- My friend is going through a rough patch,

13
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,580
he needs cash quick.

14
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,780
What do we have at hand?
- About 700,000.

15
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,860
I need it all.
- We'll be left cleaned.

16
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:49,020
Money has to be invested, right?
That's what you taught me.

17
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:55,220
When do you need it?
- My friend is coming tonight. Bye, Gegè.

18
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,550
Bye, Gennà.

19
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:27,500
<b><i>ENGLISH SUBTITLES BY BARISHNIKOV@KATCR.CO</i></b>

20
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,780
It's good to see you, brother.

21
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,940
Brother... I really missed you.

22
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:32,860
Let's go.
Joaquin, this is Gegè.

23
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,200
Nice to meet you.
- How's going?

24
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,200
My friend is the best accountant in the world.
- He's exaggerating.

25
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:47,300
If it wasn't for his family, I'd be unemployed.
- Tell me about your problem.

26
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:54,140
Don't worry, you can trust him.
- Those sons of bitches are already here, in Rome.

27
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:59,140
Who are they?
- A shitty gang that's making war to me.

28
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:05,380
If they close this deal,
I'm gonna be screwed.

29
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,980
I have good friends among the Calabrians.

30
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,700
I'll make a few phone calls
and see what's going on, ok?

31
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,980
Alright.

32
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,580
Let's go, Gegè.

33
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:26,060
You must not worry.
- They're killing all my people.

34
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,500
You're with me tonight.

35
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,700
No, I can't walk away.

36
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,100
Tell Giulia, 
I'll talk to her myself.

37
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,780
Bye.

38
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:49,320
I know it's not you kind of thing,
but this is an emergency.

39
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,140
What's going on?

40
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:59,820
I spoke to my friends,
this thing must be done tonight.

41
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,300
I need your help.

42
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,700
Is there a problem?
- No... no problem.

43
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:16,020
I'm at your disposal, you know that.
- I know, I just wanted to hear it.

44
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:26,020
What do they want in exchange?
- Our stuff is 23 per kilo.

45
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:34,010
Your friends were selling at 29.
- Friends... those fuckers will pay for that extra 6,000.

46
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,980
Let's go.

47
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,940
Wait here.

48
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,500
Honey, not now...

49
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,180
I need you inside.

50
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:57,100
We gotta hurry, 
the cleaners will be here in two hours. 

51
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,780
Ready?
- Yes.

52
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,540
Get a mop from the bathroom.

53
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,900
Move it, Gegè!

54
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,460
Let's do the other one.
- Ok, brother.

55
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,860
Gegè, are you alright?

56
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,380
Come.

57
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,100
Make a nice video.

58
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,780
Hurry!

59
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,100
Sons of bitches!

60
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:46,260
Wherever you go, this is how
you're gonna end, you pieces of shit!

61
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:52,920
The Devil has come, you faggots.
We'll cut all your heads off, motherfuckers!

62
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,340
Enough now.

63
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,820
Get the flashlight.

64
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,780
These motherfuckers are heavy!

65
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:12,460
Here we are. Give me that one.
- This one?

66
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,260
Here's the other one.

67
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,780
Untie the rope, Gegè.

68
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,820
Here is good.

69
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,900
One, two, three.

70
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,820
The light, Gegè.

71
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,020
Go to hell, cowards.

72
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,680
Go back, Gegè.

73
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:49,260
I'm so sorry about Giulia.

74
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:05,500
What you're doing
isn't good for you.

75
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:10,740
This is giving me the chance
I never would have got otherwise.

76
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:19,620
What happened tonight?
Can you tell me?

77
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:27,020
I had to join him for dinner
with an important client.

78
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:32,620
I never ask you questions
and I'm on your side.

79
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,820
But you can always pull out...

80
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,980
...if you want to.

81
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:49,020
When you're back, we'll have a nice lunch.
- I'll be back in two days.

82
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,560
Patrizia, you play hard-to-get.

83
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:14,220
What do you want?
- Ma'am Scianel has a message for your friend Marinella.

84
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:20,820
What's the message?
- She's pissed off, her son ended up in a grave.

85
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:24,380
I know.
- Now there's the trial.

86
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:28,860
Your friend needs to be nice to her.

87
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:34,860
I don't know where she is.
- I'm positive you can find out.

88
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:40,060
I don't think Marinella could do that.
- You talk to her,

89
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:44,420
we all need a second chance, don't we?

90
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,020
I'll see what I can do.
- Do what you want,

91
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:51,620
but if Ma'am Scianel gets convicted,
the responsibility is yours.

92
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,790
Be wise.

93
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,660
He looks like a prince.

94
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,510
The father is not king yet.

95
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:17,540
Are you nervous?
- No.

96
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,860
Here we are.

97
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,940
Azzurra, you must not worry.

98
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:36,540
With all the money I earned him,
your dad should build me a golden statue.

99
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,340
You don't know him, Gennà.

100
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,100
Do you trust me?

101
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,220
Hello.
- Gegè.

102
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:24,780
Do you remember?
<i>My father-in-law is coming home today.</i>   - Yes.

103
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:28,680
<i>He'll stay 2 hours with the family,
then you come at about 2.</i>

104
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:33,980
<i>He's a son of a bitch,
he must think it all belongs to him.</i>

105
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,740
Perfect.
<i>- Do you have the papers ready?</i>

106
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,980
Yes.
<i>- I'll see you later.</i>

107
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,820
Shall we go meet grandpa?

108
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,220
Let's go.

109
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:50,040
The only good thing about house arrest
is that I'll get to stay with my nephew.

110
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,740
Hi, Giuseppe.
- Come to your grandpa.

111
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:59,900
Look how cute he is!

112
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:37,940
Are these my "wooden heads"?
- Your companies have been signed over to them, Doctor. 

113
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:42,460
If I was a doctor,
I wouldn't have been one year in jail.

114
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,980
Is this all mine?
- Precisely.

115
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:04,180
Let me show you shares and returns.
- Why, Gennà?

116
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:12,940
Why what?
- We had plenty of people for this, you instead...

117
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,980
...picked a kid from your neighborhood...

118
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:21,780
...who thinks learning Italian
will scrub the stench of hunger off him.

119
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,900
I needed someone clean,
someone unknown.

120
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:31,580
The judge knows all your men.
- You know what they say?

121
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:35,220
A dog only hears his master..
and this is your dog.

122
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:40,900
There's no dogs here,
you're the only boss in your house.

123
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,300
Explain the situation to him, Gegè.

124
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:48,840
Before going to jail,
you had about 60 million euros.

125
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:55,900
After the police liens, you were left with 1,5 millions...
- I knew that already.

126
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,940
...all into one hidden society.

127
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:07,260
Now you own 17 societies, either fully or partly,
for a total value of 97 million euros.

128
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,340
Being inside there is hell.

129
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:17,460
Then you come back home
and life has moved on.

130
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:22,740
You feel like a stranger
even inside your own family.

131
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:28,660
Everyone you used to love...
you see them as strangers.

132
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:36,700
You're no longer in jail, Giusè.
You want back your own consultants?

133
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,420
Gegè can step aside any time.

134
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:44,260
You want your "wooden heads"?
The notary will take care of that.

135
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:49,100
I'm fine with anything you wanna do.

136
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,780
But don't tell me I'm a stranger.

137
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:05,820
I'm your daughter's husband,
your grandson's father.

138
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,700
Don't ever forget that.

139
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:15,580
That's exactly what I don't want to forget.

140
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,380
Hello?
- It's Patrizia.

141
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:41,460
I'm glad you're ok.
- I didn't call to say hello.

142
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:49,020
A common friend is making a fuss.

143
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:53,020
I need to see you and tell you everything.

144
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,660
Tonight is good.
Where?

145
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,900
I'll text you.

146
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,940
Hi, Gennà.

147
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,780
Come in.

148
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:07,900
Coffee?
- Thanks.

149
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,190
What is it?
You don't like my place?

150
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,300
You chose it.

151
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,340
They live there.

152
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,100
My brothers.

153
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:54,340
When they see me in the street,
they cross to the other side.

154
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:58,500
Soon I won't even be able
to watch them from here.

155
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,700
Why?

156
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,340
My brother left school and went to work.

157
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,740
Now I found out he lost his job too.

158
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:16,100
Social workers came around already.

159
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:23,060
Next time they'll take the kids,
I won't even be able to see them.

160
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:28,380
What do you want from me?

161
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:35,060
A job for my brother.
An honest job.

162
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,980
Not in Naples though.

163
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:43,620
My family must get out of this hell.

164
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:50,340
Tomorrow your brother will have the job.

165
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:05,140
He can't know who got him the job.
- Alright.

166
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:09,860
Now what about our common friend?

167
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:17,540
Scianel contacted me,
she has a proposal for Marinella.

168
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:21,580
She wants me to find her,
what do I do?

169
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:30,660
Do what she told you.
I'm more comfortable if you're near her anyway.

170
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:30,180
Can I help you?
- I'm looking for Irene.

171
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:33,660
Irene!
<i>- Coming!</i>

172
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:52,700
I have no regrets, I'd do the same thing 
100 more times, tell it to that Scianel bitch!

173
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:56,580
What did you get from it, Marinella?
- Justice!

174
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:02,060
The dead don't give a shit about justice.
- Of all people, you say that?

175
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:06,500
You forgot about what you had me
do to Lelluccio?

176
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:09,820
I don't understand you.

177
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:16,260
Marinella... she'll find you,
just like I did.

178
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:20,780
Only the next one coming
won't be carrying a backpack.

179
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:26,220
As for me, I work for myself,
mind my own fucking business.

180
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:33,300
Do you work for the Savastanos?
- I told you what I had to tell.

181
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:42,220
Sooner or later, she'll have to eat dust.
Promise me that.

182
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:51,300
30 now and 30 after.

183
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:11,260
It's not from me.
- I meant to, so it's yours.

184
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:15,100
Yes but it's not my money.

185
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:22,890
I spent half my life listening to my father
complain about money shortage...

186
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:27,300
...and the other half trying to understand
how money works and you know what?

187
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,120
Money's worth shit.

188
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:35,580
It's not important how you get it.

189
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:44,220
What's important is nobody will
take this day away from your daughter.

190
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,460
Silvano?
- Yes.

191
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,280
Silvano Romini?
- Yes.

192
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,620
She must be Giulia then.
- Who are you?

193
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,660
Someone who can no longer sleep.
- Dad!

194
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,260
Let her go!
- Why would I?

195
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:32,940
In my own house, in my own bed,
I see a stranger with my own eyes...

196
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:37,580
...and it's also because of our friend.
- What's he saying?

197
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:41,180
Tell your daughter,
for her own good.

198
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:45,420
And explain it to me too!
- I know nothing.

199
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:50,220
Bullshit!
I wanna know the truth!

200
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:54,860
Tell it to that faggot Gegè!

201
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:12,100
Aren't you in London?
- Giulia's in danger.

202
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,260
What do you mean?

203
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,860
He stopped us in the street.
- Who?

204
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:20,180
Your friend's father-in-law.
- What did he want?

205
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:23,320
He wants his son-in-law's head.
- Why...

206
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:30,220
What the fuck do I know?
Have you tried to screw him? You tell me!

207
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:38,100
You can't stay clean
working for these people.

208
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:45,660
I fear for Giulia,
what can we do?

209
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,740
What do you want from me?

210
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:37,100
Gennaro is fucking me.

211
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:41,820
I can feel it... I know it.

212
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,940
Isn't that so?

213
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:57,340
I wanna know how.

214
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:02,700
If I do this,
Gennaro will kill me.

215
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:06,540
If you don't, 
I kill you and your friend.

216
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:10,660
Gegè, you are good.

217
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:17,860
Otherwise Gennaro wouldn't have hired you
and I'd already know how he's fucking me.

218
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:25,500
You must decide who's your boss,
right now.

219
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,220
This is a very nice hotel.

220
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,380
How long did you take, Gegè?
- He was very accommodating.

221
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:41,380
Did he cause any trouble?
- Not at all.

222
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:47,460
How about this, huh?
- This is the most wonderful view, brother!

223
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:51,900
Show him the pictures, Gegè.

224
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,060
What a classy hotel.

225
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,900
True quality.

226
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:07,140
The most amazing business
of my whole life.

227
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:13,260
Isn't that right, Gegè?
- Don't talk while you eat, shut up.

228
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:18,020
Girls, here's to you.

229
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:28,780
Tomorrow you'll have 25% of this resort...

230
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:32,780
...and after the shipment,
you'll have the other 25%.

231
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:36,060
For a total of...?

232
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,220
Gegè! Are you sleeping?
- Sorry, Gennà... you said...

233
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:44,700
How much do we get with this hotel?
- 10 million euros.

234
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:52,300
More than what I owed you
and you're left with the property of half the hotel.

235
00:42:52,380 --> 00:43:00,140
Good, brother. I never invested in Europe
but it sounds like a good idea.

236
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:13,140
Till death, brother.
- Always.

237
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,540
Always.

238
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,420
Captain!

239
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:55,300
Everything alright, Gegè?
- Yes.

240
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:00,020
I'll see you tomorrow.

241
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:32,660
Azzurra, where were you?
- Hi, love.

242
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:37,380
Mom woke up and dad wasn't in bed.

243
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,820
He got out.

244
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:47,020
Where did he go?
- He wouldn't say.

245
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:59,260
Is there something wrong, Gennà?

246
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:03,140
Everything's fine, Azzurra.

247
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:18,020
Happy birthday to you!

248
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,380
Wait for me,
grandpa's got you a present.

249
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:48,100
Hurry up.

250
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,820
He gave it his son't name.
- What is it?

251
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:13,620
The shell company he created to fuck me.

252
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:20,060
I see a shipment here...

253
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:24,540
...that he's about to sell on his own.

254
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:34,020
That stuff is not for the Rome market,
nor for the Naples clans.

255
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:40,660
Son of a bitch!

256
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:46,820
He's fucking us all.
- What will you do?

257
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:52,030
We wait till the shipment is here...

258
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:56,100
...then I get rid of him.

259
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:03,300

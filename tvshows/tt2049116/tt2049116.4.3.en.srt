2
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:12,048
Shut up!
- What do you want?

3
00:01:12,268 --> 00:01:14,628
Knock! Be quiet.

4
00:01:18,867 --> 00:01:21,187
Hello, love.
- Shut up, don't move.

5
00:01:21,307 --> 00:01:24,666
Please, don't hurt me.
- Move!

6
00:01:24,786 --> 00:01:27,866
Move, c'mon!
Go in, move!

7
00:01:28,945 --> 00:01:30,425
Move!

8
00:01:30,545 --> 00:01:32,384
Stay there, don't speak.

9
00:01:32,504 --> 00:01:34,385
Sit there and don't move.

10
00:01:34,505 --> 00:01:37,264
Give me the phone.
Santiago, go in there.

11
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:46,782
Everybody out and go in there.

12
00:01:46,902 --> 00:01:49,142
What's going on?
- Come out, move!

13
00:01:49,262 --> 00:01:51,622
Get down here, on the floor. Move!

14
00:01:51,742 --> 00:01:54,981
Get down on the floor and don't move.

15
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:56,820
Who's in here? Come out.

16
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,780
You go too, move!
On your knees, like them.

17
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,219
Go get the wallets in the rooms.

18
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:09,539
Don't move. Keep still!
Don't move!

19
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:14,218
Put it in here, hurry!

20
00:02:15,298 --> 00:02:18,617
Everyone get up
and go in there, quick!

21
00:02:19,697 --> 00:02:21,917
Move, you too!

22
00:02:24,056 --> 00:02:26,136
Are you still here? Move!

23
00:02:26,256 --> 00:02:30,855
Get on your knees. You too.
On your knees. Let's go.

24
00:02:30,975 --> 00:02:33,535
Carmine, I got everyone's wallets?

25
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:37,334
Get up! Where do you keep the money?
- In there.

26
00:02:38,334 --> 00:02:42,733
What the fuck are you doing?
- You shut up!

27
00:02:42,853 --> 00:02:46,333
You shut up! Shut up!

28
00:02:46,453 --> 00:02:52,811
Shut up, you hear me?
Shut up or I'll kill you.

29
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,490
Give me the money, hurry up.

30
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,089
It's all here, I swear.
Now go, please!

31
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:07,449
Santiago, let's go!

32
00:03:34,525 --> 00:03:37,550
The Holy Virgin sent you, Donna Patrizia.

33
00:03:43,203 --> 00:03:45,103
Hello?

34
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:48,479
Okay, be right there.

35
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:53,961
We gotta go.
- All right.

36
00:03:57,721 --> 00:04:00,800
Donna Patrizia, excuse me.
- Watch it! Mind your manners.

37
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,320
It's important.

38
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,599
Don't worry,
tomorrow we'll fix everything.

39
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,839
Thanks anyway.

40
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,071
Let's see if you learnt...

41
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:58,175
Who is in charge here?

42
00:04:58,304 --> 00:05:00,171
Patrizia.

43
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:04,430
Donna Patrizia! Who is it, your sister?

44
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:07,629
What do you say?
- Donna Patrizia.

45
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:10,589
Louder!
- Donna Patrizia.

46
00:05:12,028 --> 00:05:15,467
Scumbags, wash your mouth out
before you say her name.

47
00:05:15,587 --> 00:05:17,628
Nicola.

48
00:05:24,506 --> 00:05:27,086
Whose kids are you?

49
00:05:29,105 --> 00:05:30,905
No one.

50
00:05:32,704 --> 00:05:35,305
Dad's in jail in Secondigliano.

51
00:05:36,344 --> 00:05:38,644
And your mom?

52
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:42,463
Mom...

53
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,763
Mom's dead.

54
00:05:50,102 --> 00:05:53,981
Where do you live?
- In Secondigliano.

55
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:59,900
With my big sister and a little brother.

56
00:06:15,498 --> 00:06:21,537
You and your brother are just kids,
but here you grow up fast.

57
00:06:21,657 --> 00:06:23,917
Don't forget that.

58
00:06:26,855 --> 00:06:29,456
Leave him alone.
- What?

59
00:06:29,576 --> 00:06:31,375
Nicola, come.

60
00:06:38,734 --> 00:06:40,413
Do they belong to anyone?

61
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:43,732
They work on their own,
they're not under anyone.

62
00:06:43,852 --> 00:06:46,213
They need to understand
how the world works.

63
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,212
Get them a job and stay on them.

64
00:06:49,332 --> 00:06:52,931
They're a couple of pissants
who don't listen to no one.

65
00:06:54,131 --> 00:06:58,010
Can we trust them?
- We'll see.

66
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,490
Nicola...

67
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,449
I know you think you should
command with a stick,

68
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:09,178
but then the stick breaks
and you've seen it.

69
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:12,747
We gotta change strategy.

70
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:34,299
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you all day.

71
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,634
Give it to me,
I'll show you how to play.

72
00:08:37,754 --> 00:08:39,754
Well?

73
00:08:49,032 --> 00:08:50,671
What have you done?

74
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,416
What happened to you?
What have you done?

75
00:08:55,311 --> 00:08:57,031
Nothing.

76
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,950
Santiago, what happened?

77
00:09:04,219 --> 00:09:07,555
I said nothing happened, all right?

78
00:09:11,361 --> 00:09:15,755
It's you, it's always you.
You're leading him down the wrong path.

79
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:19,929
Leave the kid alone,
I don't want him to end up like you.

80
00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:23,867
What are you gonna do about it?

81
00:09:25,906 --> 00:09:30,470
He's still gotta eat, I didn't prepare
anything yet, you take care of it.

82
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:06,471
BOLOGNA CENTRAL STATION

83
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:33,994
Want anything?
- Another time.

84
00:12:34,114 --> 00:12:37,949
There's a million euros in the car
out front, for the down payment.

85
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,492
Serge, go get it.

86
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:45,024
When the job's done, you get the rest.
- All right.

87
00:12:46,513 --> 00:12:49,072
Why didn't we see each other in Naples?

88
00:12:49,192 --> 00:12:52,645
Problems?
- No, I had stuff to do in Bologna.

89
00:13:14,707 --> 00:13:18,947
Can I help you?
- There should be a booking for Ferreri.

90
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:21,367
I'll check right away.

91
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:27,945
Fifth floor, room 501.
- Thank you.

92
00:13:28,065 --> 00:13:29,785
Thank you.

93
00:15:43,003 --> 00:15:44,803
Counselor.

94
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:47,842
Did you find it easily?
- No problem.

95
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,200
This way, counselor.

96
00:16:17,637 --> 00:16:20,557
This is the sales contract for the dump.

97
00:16:20,677 --> 00:16:25,516
For you there's 20,000 euros up front,
a repayment schedule for the bank debt

98
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:29,396
and we'll give you something
for the bank guarantees.

99
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:31,252
And then?

100
00:16:31,273 --> 00:16:34,081
There's time for the paperwork
to go through before closing.

101
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:38,074
Meanwhile, I'll put a figurehead in,
one of our guys.

102
00:16:40,535 --> 00:16:43,340
I don't have any intention at 60

103
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:48,272
of having them come to get me
at six in the morning.

104
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,884
You need to relax.

105
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,750
You're in clover.

106
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,989
All I want is reassurance
that you're doing things by the book.

107
00:17:06,389 --> 00:17:11,268
I'm handing you a structure...
- Pasanelli...

108
00:17:11,388 --> 00:17:14,787
You've always tried to do things
by the book, right?

109
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:19,747
And what have you accomplished?

110
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:23,826
In two years 500,000 euros profit
and 800,000 in debt.

111
00:17:24,974 --> 00:17:27,825
If I come here now
and I repay those debts,

112
00:17:27,945 --> 00:17:30,630
do you think I'm doing it all
by the book?

113
00:17:31,846 --> 00:17:33,705
No.

114
00:17:51,861 --> 00:17:54,381
Yo, what do you want?
- A piece.

115
00:17:56,861 --> 00:17:59,200
Give me a piece.

116
00:18:17,257 --> 00:18:19,357
Let's go.

117
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,989
So little?

118
00:19:08,402 --> 00:19:10,597
Boys...

119
00:19:12,128 --> 00:19:14,967
after what you did it's too much.

120
00:19:16,248 --> 00:19:18,367
Now get out of here.

121
00:19:31,564 --> 00:19:34,005
You did a good job.

122
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:37,444
If you behave,
there's a monthly payment for you too.

123
00:19:37,564 --> 00:19:40,203
Thank you.
- Thank you.

124
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,438
The deal with our friend is done.

125
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:13,998
Good, it's already full here.
- All the paperwork's done.

126
00:20:14,118 --> 00:20:17,103
We can send the garbage
to the new plant from tomorrow.

127
00:20:17,224 --> 00:20:20,966
How the fuck can you stand
this disgusting stink?

128
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:25,045
What stink? The only thing
I can smell here is money, Fabrizio.

129
00:20:30,315 --> 00:20:34,031
In the last three days we've treated
three tons of garbage.

130
00:20:35,381 --> 00:20:39,394
That shit is the finished product,
ready to be trucked out.

131
00:20:39,514 --> 00:20:42,753
The construction business
is the biggest we have.

132
00:20:42,873 --> 00:20:46,872
And we have as much raw material
as we need, infinite.

133
00:22:19,444 --> 00:22:21,870
All good?
- <i>Yes.</i>

134
00:22:21,991 --> 00:22:24,741
<i>Soon, tons of reinforced concrete
will be ready.</i>

135
00:22:24,836 --> 00:22:27,428
Are you coming back?

136
00:22:27,835 --> 00:22:31,875
I still have something to do in Bologna.
I'm staying overnight.

137
00:22:36,098 --> 00:22:38,314
<i>Dad?</i>
- All right.

138
00:23:37,878 --> 00:23:41,878
It's just you didn't tell me
where we're going tonight,

139
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,380
so I bought this.

140
00:23:45,804 --> 00:23:48,044
It's a surprise, I told you.

141
00:23:49,171 --> 00:23:51,968
Don't be silly! How do I look?

142
00:23:57,741 --> 00:24:00,288
You look beautiful, Patrizia.

143
00:24:26,055 --> 00:24:28,656
Hand me the cape,
I'll put it away for you.

144
00:24:28,776 --> 00:24:30,476
Sure.

145
00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:33,454
I'll be right back.

146
00:24:33,574 --> 00:24:35,574
May I?

147
00:24:52,148 --> 00:24:53,932
Mickey!
- My man!

148
00:24:54,053 --> 00:24:56,053
Dude!
- How are you?

149
00:24:56,174 --> 00:25:00,133
Good! I'm glad you came.
- Me too. This is Patrizia.

150
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,630
Fabio, my pleasure.

151
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:08,329
I'm the guy who put up with five years
of university with the out-of-towner.

152
00:25:08,449 --> 00:25:10,289
You put up with me?

153
00:25:11,648 --> 00:25:14,767
And where are you from?
- Naples.

154
00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:18,527
You found a girl from your area.
- Of course!

155
00:25:18,647 --> 00:25:22,806
You know Mickey, right?
In the end, he went home.

156
00:25:22,926 --> 00:25:27,565
He did the right thing.
And what do you do, Patrizia?

157
00:25:29,085 --> 00:25:32,204
I do more or less what he does.

158
00:25:35,724 --> 00:25:37,984
Let's go in here.

159
00:25:39,016 --> 00:25:41,257
Let's park here.

160
00:26:07,151 --> 00:26:09,550
Excuse me! Two vodka shots.

161
00:26:39,229 --> 00:26:41,433
Mickey!
- Eleonora!

162
00:26:41,553 --> 00:26:43,512
How are you?
- Good, you?

163
00:26:43,632 --> 00:26:45,753
All good. This is Patrizia.

164
00:26:45,873 --> 00:26:48,872
Nice to meet you, Eleonora.
- Nice to meet you.

165
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:54,271
What are you doing here?
- We came to get a drink. You?

166
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:56,870
I always come here.

167
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,710
It's good to see you.
- Me too.

168
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,614
Right... How long are you staying?

169
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:06,862
Just long enough to have a drink.

170
00:27:08,573 --> 00:27:11,132
Mickey... wait.

171
00:27:16,604 --> 00:27:20,846
All right. Maybe I'll see you later.
- Maybe.

172
00:27:21,043 --> 00:27:24,306
Have a good night. Bye, Fabrizia.

173
00:27:30,705 --> 00:27:32,705
Everything okay, Patrizia?

174
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:47,048
It's no good, you need to change it.

175
00:27:49,242 --> 00:27:52,281
Sorry, can you make another one?
It's no good.

176
00:28:13,894 --> 00:28:15,853
Patrizia!

177
00:28:17,257 --> 00:28:19,216
Patrizia, stop!

178
00:28:43,132 --> 00:28:45,773
I'm Carmine,
he's my brother Santiago.

179
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:47,332
Pleasure, Ilenia.

180
00:28:47,452 --> 00:28:49,772
She's Anna.
- Pleasure.

181
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:55,771
Wanna dance?
- Let's dance.

182
00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:07,929
Want some coke?
- No, I got no money.

183
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:10,648
It's a present.
- Wait.

184
00:29:11,848 --> 00:29:13,368
What happened?

185
00:29:13,488 --> 00:29:15,928
He wants to give us some coke,
what do we do?

186
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:18,727
What do we do? We take it.

187
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:22,026
Okay, let's go.

188
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:17,437
Turn it off.
- No, or else they'll hear us.

189
00:30:52,912 --> 00:30:55,911
Santiago, got something to snort with?
- No, nothing.

190
00:30:56,031 --> 00:30:58,310
You got anything?

191
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:02,270
Turn off the water.
- Here.

192
00:32:12,218 --> 00:32:15,377
Got any more?
- Wait here.

193
00:32:25,815 --> 00:32:30,095
What are you going to do? We're outta cash.
- You'll see.

194
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:02,110
Give me 20.
- Another one?

195
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:04,487
Another one.

196
00:33:09,329 --> 00:33:11,208
Bro', you got five?

197
00:33:11,328 --> 00:33:13,967
Yeah, you want ten?
- Give me ten.

198
00:33:20,007 --> 00:33:22,030
Guys!

199
00:33:22,326 --> 00:33:24,606
You find it? Let's go.

200
00:33:35,924 --> 00:33:38,203
Catch those little shits!

201
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,439
There they are, turn around.

202
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,359
Turn!

203
00:34:15,437 --> 00:34:17,517
We'll go in this way.

204
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,870
Guys, they're up there.

205
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:03,909
We found them, hurry up.

206
00:35:29,395 --> 00:35:32,086
Come out! Better for everyone if you do!

207
00:35:32,207 --> 00:35:35,047
There they are, little shits.

208
00:35:39,503 --> 00:35:44,022
Now you run away, piece of shit!
Now you have to run away!

209
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,622
Did you have fun being an asshole?

210
00:35:46,742 --> 00:35:49,942
Did you have fun, you piece of shit?

211
00:35:54,021 --> 00:35:57,101
What the fuck
are you doing on our turf?

212
00:35:57,221 --> 00:36:01,779
Who do you belong to?
- We're from Secondigliano.

213
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:05,739
We're under Patrizia.

214
00:36:05,859 --> 00:36:10,858
That ugly bitch Patrizia
brings her trash onto our turf?

215
00:36:10,978 --> 00:36:15,098
Is that right?
- They're just talking shit, Enzo.

216
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,649
Let's take it easy, guys.

217
00:36:27,295 --> 00:36:30,586
I'm not getting my hands dirty
with Patrizia's shit.

218
00:36:38,851 --> 00:36:40,850
Patrizia?

219
00:37:15,207 --> 00:37:18,887
Good morning.
- Good morning.

220
00:37:23,994 --> 00:37:26,407
Welcome back, Donna Patrizia.

221
00:37:26,682 --> 00:37:28,665
Hi, Nicola.

222
00:37:55,502 --> 00:37:57,705
Leave us.

223
00:38:06,019 --> 00:38:08,018
Well?

224
00:38:08,138 --> 00:38:10,978
Sorry, Donna Patrizia.
- Yeah, sorry...

225
00:38:11,858 --> 00:38:13,958
How could you?

226
00:38:14,338 --> 00:38:18,057
I stick my neck out
to give you an opportunity

227
00:38:18,177 --> 00:38:20,577
and how do you repay me?

228
00:38:21,776 --> 00:38:24,416
You go dicking around in Forcella?

229
00:38:25,655 --> 00:38:28,696
We were just joking.
- Joking?

230
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:33,814
If it was a joke,
why aren't you laughing, Carmine?

231
00:38:36,094 --> 00:38:39,893
No, Donna Patrizia! Please!

232
00:38:40,013 --> 00:38:43,813
He's my little slave,
he does everything I tell him to.

233
00:38:43,933 --> 00:38:47,092
Take it out on me, not my brother.

234
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:52,271
Carmine...

235
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,230
Carmine...

236
00:38:56,412 --> 00:39:00,734
It's not that I don't want to be defied
by two snot-noses like you...

237
00:39:02,969 --> 00:39:05,529
It's just that I can't.

238
00:39:25,246 --> 00:39:27,725
Make them disappear.

239
00:39:35,684 --> 00:39:37,803
Hello, Enzo.

240
00:39:37,923 --> 00:39:40,724
Thank you, I took care of it personally.

241
00:39:42,283 --> 00:39:44,802
What will we tell their family now?

242
00:39:47,562 --> 00:39:49,882
They only had a sister.

243
00:39:52,437 --> 00:39:57,240
If they come, tell them I treat everyone
in Secondigliano like my children.

244
00:39:57,361 --> 00:40:00,520
But if they disrespect me,
they have to pay.

245
00:40:23,476 --> 00:40:25,919
Good evening.
Would you like to order?

246
00:40:28,156 --> 00:40:30,955
Can you send him to me?

247
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:38,194
All right.

248
00:41:07,348 --> 00:41:09,709
I'm sorry, he says he can't.

249
00:41:10,708 --> 00:41:13,148
Can I help you?

250
00:41:16,148 --> 00:41:18,167
No, thanks.

251
00:41:30,544 --> 00:41:32,785
Who was she?

252
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,793
Nobody.

253
00:42:07,898 --> 00:42:13,099

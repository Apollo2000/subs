2
00:01:31,075 --> 00:01:33,273
Mamma.

3
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:35,595
How is everyone?

4
00:01:37,275 --> 00:01:40,355
- And you?
- I'm fine, I already told you.

5
00:01:56,195 --> 00:01:58,955
Mind telling me what the fuck happened?

6
00:02:01,115 --> 00:02:04,555
- Blue Blood tried to kill us all.
- He's not the problem!

7
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:08,115
But whoever's behind him!

8
00:02:09,435 --> 00:02:12,793
They were waiting for me
in that shithole.

9
00:02:12,795 --> 00:02:15,233
She told you
Blue Blood was there, right?

10
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,073
So what?

11
00:02:17,075 --> 00:02:20,635
She doesn't know
that you're behind the bust.

12
00:02:21,795 --> 00:02:24,195
Or do you think I told her?

13
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:28,233
We're only alive by a miracle.

14
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:32,833
But not you...
You look like you've been for a stroll.

15
00:02:32,835 --> 00:02:35,835
Tell me to my face
if you think I tried to kill you.

16
00:02:37,635 --> 00:02:40,995
If I wanted you dead,
you'd be buried by now.

17
00:02:48,555 --> 00:02:51,313
We need to stay calm.

18
00:02:51,315 --> 00:02:54,353
Calm and united.

19
00:02:54,355 --> 00:02:57,513
We're under attack,

20
00:02:57,515 --> 00:03:01,835
and I want to be sure we don't have
enemies other than Blue Blood.

21
00:03:03,995 --> 00:03:08,115
So, Michelangelo keep
your eyes open in Secondigliano.

22
00:03:09,235 --> 00:03:11,315
For you and for us.

23
00:03:14,155 --> 00:03:16,675
There's one thing
Michelangelo's right about.

24
00:03:18,475 --> 00:03:23,475
We're a family
and we gotta act like a family.

25
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,515
Understood?

26
00:04:09,435 --> 00:04:12,873
I handed the Levantes to you
on a silver platter,

27
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,713
and yet they're still standing.

28
00:04:15,715 --> 00:04:18,873
Either they're very lucky,

29
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,395
or they had a guardian angel.

30
00:04:24,115 --> 00:04:25,595
Or maybe you're useless.

31
00:04:27,675 --> 00:04:30,113
To see if that's true
we gotta try again.

32
00:04:30,115 --> 00:04:33,515
Not now. Now you need to lie low.

33
00:04:34,915 --> 00:04:37,475
They're after you,
they mustn't find you here.

34
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,595
You gotta get away.

35
00:04:46,115 --> 00:04:48,715
Patrizia, you know why I'm here.

36
00:04:52,755 --> 00:04:55,593
I want revenge, too,

37
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:58,553
but at the right moment.

38
00:04:58,555 --> 00:05:01,115
Meanwhile, we gotta keep a low profile.

39
00:05:02,315 --> 00:05:03,995
Understood?

40
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:09,955
Now get outta here.

41
00:05:57,435 --> 00:06:01,395
- Where have you been?
- At Enzo's with the guys, talking.

42
00:06:04,835 --> 00:06:06,713
What did you have to say?

43
00:06:06,715 --> 00:06:08,995
For now they gotta disappear.

44
00:06:11,995 --> 00:06:16,675
- What does your family say?
- They suspect you too.

45
00:06:18,635 --> 00:06:22,193
They're not sure,
but we got a spotlight on us.

46
00:06:22,195 --> 00:06:24,275
We have to be careful.

47
00:06:33,115 --> 00:06:36,153
Truth is, while they're alive,
we're not safe.

48
00:06:36,155 --> 00:06:38,955
And now I gotta take
Secondigliano back.

49
00:06:46,635 --> 00:06:48,395
Michelangelo!

50
00:06:53,435 --> 00:06:55,753
Remember who we're doing it for.

51
00:06:55,755 --> 00:06:59,475
I know what I'm doing and who it's for,
no need to remind me.

52
00:07:03,035 --> 00:07:05,035
I know how you feel.

53
00:07:09,435 --> 00:07:12,275
But you gotta relax.

54
00:07:15,195 --> 00:07:17,715
So far, there are no dead to mourn.

55
00:08:38,515 --> 00:08:39,835
Everything okay?

56
00:08:42,995 --> 00:08:45,475
Speed up a little.

57
00:08:51,835 --> 00:08:54,235
Turn right.

58
00:08:59,675 --> 00:09:02,475
Patrizia, don't turn around,
we got a car tailing us.

59
00:09:29,315 --> 00:09:31,393
So what do I do?

60
00:09:31,395 --> 00:09:34,113
- We'll go home.
- Let's finish our rounds.

61
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,235
- Patrizia...
- I said let's go.

62
00:09:57,955 --> 00:09:59,835
Get out, I'll be right there.

63
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:13,193
Don't you dare contradict me
in front of my men ever again!

64
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,633
I'm in charge here.

65
00:10:15,635 --> 00:10:20,435
I can't let them see me weak,
neither in my house nor outside it.

66
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:23,673
Then excuse me.

67
00:10:23,675 --> 00:10:26,113
I thought I was talking to Bianca's mom,

68
00:10:26,115 --> 00:10:28,675
but I'm dealing with
the boss of Secondigliano.

69
00:11:25,915 --> 00:11:27,995
Where's my father?

70
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:36,793
Papa! Why the fuck
have you got a car tailing us?

71
00:11:36,795 --> 00:11:38,993
Calm down, Michelangelo.

72
00:11:38,995 --> 00:11:41,713
You told me
to keep my eyes open and I did,

73
00:11:41,715 --> 00:11:44,075
but it seems you don't trust me.

74
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,395
We've been attacked three times.

75
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:52,793
Someone's gotta be behind it.

76
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:56,075
Maybe it's only that little shit
from Forcella, maybe not.

77
00:11:58,675 --> 00:12:02,555
I watch my house and I do it well.

78
00:12:04,435 --> 00:12:07,395
I'm asking you, please,
you gotta trust me.

79
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,995
You're my blood, Michelangelo.

80
00:12:14,435 --> 00:12:16,795
We all trust you.

81
00:13:10,555 --> 00:13:13,993
They confirmed, the shipment
arrives tomorrow morning.

82
00:13:13,995 --> 00:13:16,195
Good, I'll go.

83
00:13:19,755 --> 00:13:22,595
I don't like you going out on your own.

84
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:25,713
Then we'll go together,

85
00:13:25,715 --> 00:13:28,153
that way they can't do anything to me.

86
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:30,075
I'll go by myself.

87
00:13:31,355 --> 00:13:33,793
I need to be seen in the streets.

88
00:13:33,795 --> 00:13:36,793
As boss of Secondigliano
they gotta know I'm always there.

89
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:39,593
If I hide like a rat, I'm nobody's boss.

90
00:13:39,595 --> 00:13:40,995
Patrizia...

91
00:13:45,435 --> 00:13:49,153
Please, listen to me.

92
00:13:49,155 --> 00:13:52,915
I have a bank account in Switzerland
with two million, why don't we leave?

93
00:13:53,995 --> 00:13:56,713
We can go and live wherever we want,

94
00:13:56,715 --> 00:13:59,033
far away from my family,
from all this shit.

95
00:13:59,035 --> 00:14:01,235
I don't want to go anywhere.

96
00:14:02,235 --> 00:14:04,673
My place is here.

97
00:14:04,675 --> 00:14:07,393
You don't get it, they want to kill you!

98
00:14:07,395 --> 00:14:10,233
If they want to kill me, here I am,

99
00:14:10,235 --> 00:14:12,755
but they'll have to make war on my turf.

100
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:17,393
When you married me,
you knew who I was.

101
00:14:17,395 --> 00:14:19,035
Yes, I knew.

102
00:14:20,515 --> 00:14:22,635
Tomorrow I'm going to the delivery.

103
00:14:25,795 --> 00:14:28,355
If you come, good,
you've chosen our family.

104
00:14:29,395 --> 00:14:33,475
But if you don't come, I'm sure Papa
will be glad to have you back home.

105
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,875
Thank you for coming.

106
00:17:29,835 --> 00:17:33,673
- There's problems in Bologna.
- Bologna?

107
00:17:33,675 --> 00:17:36,353
That's strange, I didn't hear anything.

108
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,875
I did.

109
00:17:42,435 --> 00:17:45,355
- And what do I do?
- You leave in the morning.

110
00:17:46,395 --> 00:17:48,753
I can't tomorrow.

111
00:17:48,755 --> 00:17:52,953
But don't worry, I'll make some calls
and straighten it out.

112
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:56,155
Some problems can
only be solved in person.

113
00:18:01,195 --> 00:18:03,193
I'll go,

114
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:07,315
but are you sure this problem
can't be solved any other way?

115
00:18:08,315 --> 00:18:13,233
There are things
that people get whacked for,

116
00:18:13,235 --> 00:18:16,235
before they even have time to apologize.

117
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,753
Then there are sons,

118
00:18:20,755 --> 00:18:24,753
who mess up again and again,

119
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:27,315
but you forgive them everything
'cause they're your kids.

120
00:18:50,515 --> 00:18:54,233
The other night, I had
three powerful charges put in,

121
00:18:54,235 --> 00:18:58,073
the same stuff we use at the quarry.

122
00:18:58,075 --> 00:19:00,275
Her men are already here.

123
00:19:02,155 --> 00:19:06,315
Stand by with that gizmo,
we gonna bring the sky down.

124
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:48,835
Donna Patrizia,
the shipment's arriving now.

125
00:19:58,075 --> 00:20:00,235
Let's go.

126
00:20:03,715 --> 00:20:07,713
- They're opening the gate.
- The shipment's here.

127
00:20:07,715 --> 00:20:10,273
- That's it, yeah?
- She's missing though.

128
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,115
Keep your eyes peeled.

129
00:20:46,555 --> 00:20:48,713
C'mon, let's do it.

130
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:50,435
Faster!

131
00:20:52,315 --> 00:20:53,635
Donna Patrizia's coming.

132
00:21:03,675 --> 00:21:05,835
There, she's coming.

133
00:21:16,955 --> 00:21:18,835
Where the fuck is she?

134
00:21:21,235 --> 00:21:24,435
- She's coming in, get ready.
- Today we're gonna get rid of her ass!

135
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:38,515
What the fuck's going on?

136
00:21:41,115 --> 00:21:43,435
Police!

137
00:21:54,275 --> 00:21:55,753
Let's go!

138
00:21:55,755 --> 00:21:57,475
Calm down!

139
00:21:59,955 --> 00:22:02,155
Shut up!

140
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,875
Don't push me.

141
00:22:26,795 --> 00:22:28,315
What happened?

142
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:31,873
They arrested Patrizia.

143
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,715
What the fuck does that mean?

144
00:22:34,715 --> 00:22:38,595
The cops made a raid
and got her and the shipment.

145
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,353
It's the second time it's happened.

146
00:22:43,355 --> 00:22:46,555
- People in Secondigliano...
- The fuck do I care about the people?

147
00:22:53,195 --> 00:22:55,235
Go, Fernando, I'll call you.

148
00:24:04,195 --> 00:24:05,915
What's going on?

149
00:24:10,955 --> 00:24:13,833
Why did you make me come here?

150
00:24:13,835 --> 00:24:16,155
Patrizia's been arrested.

151
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:18,755
What happens now?

152
00:24:24,315 --> 00:24:26,793
To us, nothing.

153
00:24:26,795 --> 00:24:29,995
You said if she went under,
she'd take us with her.

154
00:24:32,515 --> 00:24:35,275
And all this goes under, too?

155
00:24:39,835 --> 00:24:41,675
I'm handling it.

156
00:24:43,075 --> 00:24:45,073
Patrizia has no record,

157
00:24:45,075 --> 00:24:47,875
with a good lawyer
she'll be out in a couple of days.

158
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:55,753
The TV news said they found
a hundredweight of cocaine.

159
00:24:55,755 --> 00:24:58,393
If she wants to get out now,
she just needs to talk.

160
00:24:58,395 --> 00:25:00,355
And you know that.

161
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:03,875
A true boss never talks.

162
00:25:07,075 --> 00:25:09,115
My father never talked.

163
00:25:11,475 --> 00:25:13,795
But she's not Pietro Savastano.

164
00:25:14,915 --> 00:25:17,955
And if she decides to collaborate,
everything we've built collapses.

165
00:25:25,355 --> 00:25:28,715
Even in prison, Patrizia is
still the boss of Secondigliano.

166
00:25:30,235 --> 00:25:32,235
And she knows it.

167
00:25:43,555 --> 00:25:46,035
Santore, the cell's freed up.

168
00:26:09,995 --> 00:26:11,635
Turn right.

169
00:26:27,275 --> 00:26:30,675
Patrizia Santore, second A, cell six.

170
00:27:07,155 --> 00:27:08,595
Donna Patrizia...

171
00:27:11,555 --> 00:27:14,793
To share the cell with you
is an honor and a privilege for me.

172
00:27:14,795 --> 00:27:17,755
Take the more
comfortable bed, I moved.

173
00:27:22,635 --> 00:27:26,435
- Thank you.
- No, not those.

174
00:27:28,515 --> 00:27:30,355
These are better.

175
00:27:35,075 --> 00:27:37,675
Whatever you need, I'm at your disposal.

176
00:27:39,675 --> 00:27:41,675
Got a cigarette?

177
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:46,755
If I may say so, smoking's not good
in your condition.

178
00:27:49,315 --> 00:27:51,555
Anger's even worse.

179
00:28:33,035 --> 00:28:35,155
She's alive, Mickey.

180
00:28:38,715 --> 00:28:40,755
That's what counts.

181
00:28:55,035 --> 00:28:56,355
Patrizia Santore.

182
00:29:01,035 --> 00:29:02,395
Come.

183
00:29:08,635 --> 00:29:10,595
What's happening?

184
00:30:00,395 --> 00:30:02,995
Evening, Miss Santore,
sorry it's so late.

185
00:30:07,915 --> 00:30:11,153
Did my lawyer get lost on the way?

186
00:30:11,155 --> 00:30:14,395
I thought a little chat in private
would do us good.

187
00:30:20,515 --> 00:30:21,835
Please.

188
00:30:47,155 --> 00:30:48,635
I have nothing to say.

189
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,155
Then maybe I misunderstood.

190
00:30:54,515 --> 00:30:58,475
Your husband, Michelangelo Levante,
is obviously wrong.

191
00:30:59,955 --> 00:31:01,955
He told us about the shipment.

192
00:31:08,115 --> 00:31:11,713
- It's not true.
- That's what I thought, too.

193
00:31:11,715 --> 00:31:15,353
A husband reporting
his wife... impossible.

194
00:31:15,355 --> 00:31:18,593
But then he explained he feels safer
knowing you're in jail,

195
00:31:18,595 --> 00:31:20,715
outside he fears for your life.

196
00:31:22,155 --> 00:31:24,033
He was really worried.

197
00:31:24,035 --> 00:31:27,273
Especially after they found
enough explosives

198
00:31:27,275 --> 00:31:30,153
to blow up the building
where you were arrested.

199
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:33,673
I told him not to worry,
we'll keep you safe.

200
00:31:33,675 --> 00:31:37,835
If you have anything to tell us,
we'll protect you, give you a new life...

201
00:31:40,155 --> 00:31:43,355
Prison's no place to raise a kid, is it?

202
00:31:45,035 --> 00:31:48,235
He told me you'd definitely
have something to say.

203
00:32:00,035 --> 00:32:01,515
All right...

204
00:32:02,995 --> 00:32:05,235
Obviously he was wrong.

205
00:32:07,435 --> 00:32:11,515
If while you think of your baby
you remember something, I'm here.

206
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,235
Are you all right?

207
00:33:12,795 --> 00:33:15,115
I'm gonna be in here for a while.

208
00:33:22,475 --> 00:33:25,555
And I need a friend I can trust.

209
00:33:29,235 --> 00:33:32,755
- Are you my friend?
- I'm always at your disposal.

210
00:33:36,155 --> 00:33:37,635
Good.

211
00:33:38,835 --> 00:33:42,955
We have to let them know
I'm still in charge of Secondigliano.

212
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:17,715
How are you?

213
00:34:23,035 --> 00:34:25,275
I didn't have any other choice.

214
00:34:27,155 --> 00:34:30,075
My family nearly blew you up.

215
00:34:34,235 --> 00:34:36,713
If it wasn't yesterday, another day,
I can't protect you two forever.

216
00:34:36,715 --> 00:34:40,835
- It wasn't up to you to choose.
- But it was.

217
00:34:42,075 --> 00:34:46,435
I chose to protect my family
and I did it the only way I knew how.

218
00:34:47,715 --> 00:34:49,875
Which family are you talking about?

219
00:34:54,075 --> 00:34:56,193
Listen to me,

220
00:34:56,195 --> 00:34:59,753
I can't do anything for you in here,
I can't protect you.

221
00:34:59,755 --> 00:35:05,155
But they won't give up,
they'll try to kill you in here too.

222
00:35:06,195 --> 00:35:08,155
You have to talk to him.

223
00:35:09,195 --> 00:35:11,555
You have to collaborate.

224
00:35:17,555 --> 00:35:19,435
I'm not a rat.

225
00:35:21,155 --> 00:35:23,235
Now get out and stay outta my sight.

226
00:35:24,275 --> 00:35:26,155
You can hate me if you like...

227
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,875
but you're alive.

228
00:35:31,955 --> 00:35:36,715
Now it's all in your hands,
my daughter's life, too.

229
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:16,433
Well?

230
00:36:16,435 --> 00:36:20,793
Last night a screw took Patrizia
out of her cell.

231
00:36:20,795 --> 00:36:23,113
She came back an hour later,
that's all we know.

232
00:36:23,115 --> 00:36:25,833
If she talked we'd know by now.

233
00:36:25,835 --> 00:36:30,273
Maybe she said no for now,
but they find ways to tempt you.

234
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:35,235
The time's come to let Patrizia know
she's not alone.

235
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:51,435
Let's go for a walk.

236
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,393
You gotta do this,

237
00:37:16,395 --> 00:37:19,793
and make sure no one comes
from the other side.

238
00:37:19,795 --> 00:37:21,395
In the soup...

239
00:38:33,155 --> 00:38:37,193
Only by helping
the Levantes can we solve

240
00:38:37,195 --> 00:38:39,955
our families' problems, don't you see?

241
00:38:40,955 --> 00:38:42,555
Do what you gotta do.

242
00:38:53,755 --> 00:38:56,115
Patrizia met with Ruggieri.

243
00:39:09,075 --> 00:39:10,835
Is she going to collaborate?

244
00:39:12,315 --> 00:39:13,915
I don't know.

245
00:39:15,235 --> 00:39:16,835
Yes, you do.

246
00:39:19,155 --> 00:39:21,915
Gennaro, I've thought this through.

247
00:39:23,755 --> 00:39:27,155
She has every reason in the world
to talk, about the past too.

248
00:39:29,275 --> 00:39:33,113
I always helped her,
I put my realm in her hands.

249
00:39:33,115 --> 00:39:37,993
Gratitude doesn't count for fuck,
when you're desperate

250
00:39:37,995 --> 00:39:41,115
and when all you have to think
about is your kid's life.

251
00:39:44,675 --> 00:39:47,673
I know that,

252
00:39:47,675 --> 00:39:50,075
because I would have done
the same thing.

253
00:39:51,475 --> 00:39:53,873
But I can't let her

254
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:57,515
destroy all our work,
all we've accomplished so far.

255
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:07,115
She has to die.

256
00:40:13,155 --> 00:40:15,593
I told Fernando to get her a message.

257
00:40:15,595 --> 00:40:18,473
We got people in that prison.

258
00:40:18,475 --> 00:40:20,555
To put her mind at rest.

259
00:40:43,995 --> 00:40:46,355
Don't let her outta your sight.

260
00:41:04,315 --> 00:41:06,033
She's going alone.

261
00:41:06,035 --> 00:41:08,155
Let's go, without being seen.

262
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:07,175
Sorry, Nunzia, but there was
another way to help my family.

263
00:42:10,935 --> 00:42:12,655
What did you think you were doing?

264
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,375
Fucking bitch!

265
00:42:41,655 --> 00:42:43,735
Donna Patrizia, are you all right?

266
00:42:49,735 --> 00:42:53,775
Get help. Hurry!

267
00:43:49,657 --> 00:43:54,657

1
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,240
- Come on.
- I'm ready.

2
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,120
Drive.

Translated by: NederSubs

4
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,600
I did everything they asked.

5
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,840
But Azzurra and Pietro
are still with that asshole.

6
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,080
Despite all the fuss,
we haven't made any progress.

7
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,280
That's not true.

8
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,040
Just think about it.

9
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:54,080
Along the way you met many friends.
Old and new ones.

10
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,120
There is something else you can
give them, just think about it.

11
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,640
What, then?

12
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,760
The blood of your friends.

13
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,760
This is Patrizia.

14
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,320
She is the intermediary
Gennaro has chosen for the exchange.

15
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,760
We're here together, with the
souls in Purgatory as witnesses,

16
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,840
to give him our answer.

17
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,640
You'll speak first, Giuseppe.

18
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,360
Do you want to give your daughter
and grandson to Gennaro

19
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,960
in exchange for Blue Blood?

20
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,920
I don't agree with it.

21
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,800
I'm fine with it.

22
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,680
I think it's in everyone's interest
if we trade Enzo Villa for his family.

23
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,080
Are you sure?
We've already destroyed Genny.

24
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,800
And he no longer has a grip on
Enzo and his mates.

25
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,440
- That monkey has a double advantage.
- But we also benefit from it.

26
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:05,680
We're rid of those guys
and we can take back Forcella.

27
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Don Ruggiero, may I say something?

28
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:15,000
Patrizia, what does Ciro di Marzio
say about Gennaro's proposal?

29
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,800
I don't know.

30
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,640
But until now,
Ciro has always stood behind Genny.

31
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:28,360
I think he would even
follow Genny to hell.

32
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,560
And we make sure he'll never resurface.

33
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,560
Without Ciro di Marzio,
Gennaro Savastano is nobody.

34
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,280
- Freeze. Quiet.
- What are you doing?

35
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,840
Asshole.

36
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,240
Let's go.

37
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,200
Give it to me.

38
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,280
Are you here to work?
Do you have the money with you?

39
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,080
Step back, you need to wait.

40
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,360
- Gennaro?
- He's in the back.

41
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,960
Your security was no good.
That's the problem.

42
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:10,480
Hence all those robberies in your store.
But rest assured, we're here now.

43
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,720
You're in good hands.

44
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,560
Sign here.

45
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,040
- Did you see it?
- What is this place?

46
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,160
- A new business.
- Private security?

47
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:35,400
Everyone has something valuable
that they want to protect at all costs.

48
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,360
- Remember, Rosario.
- Everything is alright.

49
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,720
And nobody can protect them
as well as I do.

50
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,320
Did you talk to them?

51
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,760
What did they say?

52
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,480
They agree with the exchange,
including Don Avitabile.

53
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,920
But there's a problem.

54
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,200
He thinks your offer is not enough.

55
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,840
What does he want?

56
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,800
He also wants Ciro.

57
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,040
- Gennaro has accepted everything.
- He accepted it? Good.

58
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,720
As long as I'm the intermediary,
he agrees with everything.

59
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
Do you want to tell me something else?

60
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,040
He wants to speak to you.

61
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,960
Does he want to make me an offer?

62
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,240
He's really at rock bottom.

63
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,760
He wants to stop the war
and continue dealing.

64
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,560
But he's afraid of how you'd react.

65
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,120
Without your support,
Secondigliano will revolt,

66
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,040
and then he's lost that business as well.

67
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,120
Good, let him be afraid.

68
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,240
The moment has come
to crush Genny for good.

69
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,920
Think twice about it.

70
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:57,080
Before the exchange,
there's still time to hurt him even more.

71
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,320
I told him to make you a proposal,
to keep you happy.

72
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,560
A room has been prepared
for you and Pietro.

73
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,320
Gennaro is in the back.

74
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,600
Hello, Gennaro.

75
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,840
And, do you like it?

76
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,760
I've always hated guards.

77
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,040
Even if they work for you?

78
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,400
You were on my side when I needed you.

79
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,840
And I never forget anything.

80
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,800
I thought you'd want to be
my partner in this business.

81
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,120
Wow, thanks.
First grave digger, and now a guard.

82
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:27,640
I'd rather have that statue
in Piazza Garibaldi you promised me.

83
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,800
- We can forget about downtown.
- Really?

84
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,520
I can't take any more risks.
And we can walk into Secondigliano

85
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,920
without risking our lives
or jail time.

86
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,400
I knew you were unfit for the System.
It's nothing for you.

87
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,200
I'll tell you what we do.
We'll both go our separate ways.

88
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,000
But I want the money back I gave you.

89
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,720
As soon as I make a profit again.

90
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,080
There's no time for that.

91
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,800
Do you know what I think, Gennaro?

92
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:13,840
If all these businesses were mine,
I'd forget about downtown in a heartbeat.

93
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,360
Stay strong.

94
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,880
Your father wants to see you.

95
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,240
- Hello?
- Do you recognize the place where you are?

96
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,880
No.

97
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,520
I used to take you here as a child,
in the summer.

98
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,880
You were just as little
as Pietro is now.

99
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,760
He loves you very much.

100
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,800
He would do everything to get you back.

101
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,120
"Do you want this? Then you'll get this."

102
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,520
Look around you, Azzurra.

103
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:35,240
The things you see
are not only your past.

104
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,800
They will also be your future.

105
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,880
Did it go as I thought?

106
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,080
He also wants your head.

107
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,720
Cianel.

108
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,080
You know this is very risky, right?

109
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,640
Our life is one big risk.

110
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,800
- What does Enzo think?
- He already said yes.

111
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,080
Enzo is on our side.

112
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:03,440
Tomorrow at three o'clock, you have to be
at the crockery warehouse. Enzo stays there.

113
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,160
Charming's men will only come
when I've seen Azzurra and Pietro.

114
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,240
What is it?

115
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,360
It was nice to walk together a bit.

116
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,480
- Our ways won't part.
- That is not important.

117
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,960
What happens, happens.
I stay where I am.

118
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,840
Is this the revenue?

119
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,840
- And? What do you think?
- These are good businesses.

120
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,640
- Gennaro is giving you a gem.
- Poor Gennaro.

121
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,720
He worked his ass off
to bring in those people,

122
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,760
and now all the money is for me.

123
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,520
I knew you were good,
but you're really great.

124
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,360
First, you took everything away from him.
Now, you're pushing him to the graveyard.

125
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,760
Why the long face?
I never forget my friends.

126
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,840
When I become a queen,
you'll be the prince.

127
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,600
Here is the money you asked for.

128
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,840
Thanks.

129
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,160
If everything goes well,
I'll give it back to you tomorrow.

130
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,120
And otherwise I have to think about
Maria and Cosimo.

131
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,360
He's with family for the time being.

132
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,960
Are you afraid?

133
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,720
If you were, I'd understand.

134
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,680
I've lost so much.

135
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,840
And now I want to take revenge.

136
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,920
And that can kill me.

137
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,600
You won't die.
You'll grow stronger, I promise you.

138
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,520
What do your buddies say?

139
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,800
We can count on everyone.

140
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,880
Great.

141
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,520
We meet tomorrow, here.

142
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,560
What's with that bag?

143
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,280
For you and Cosimo,
if I don't come back.

144
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,240
What? Do you know
what I'm going to do with that money?

145
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:49,200
I'll buy a hot air balloon. At the wedding,
we'll fly to the reception.

146
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,360
That's what I'm going to do
with this money.

147
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,760
They're there.

148
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,160
If anything happens to me, you have to
take care of Azzurra and Pietro.

149
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,120
I will.

150
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,480
Come here, sweetie.

151
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:25,600
They're going to San Giovanni a Teduccio,
the exact location follows. Come on.

152
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,600
Remember, Patrizia.
Our fate is now in your hands.

153
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,040
We're heading for him now.

154
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,680
So it's true?

155
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,000
- Are you ready?
- Are <i>you</i> ready?

156
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:09,120
I'll do everything you say,
but I want to tell you one thing:

157
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,400
I understand
that you want to take revenge.

158
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,480
But Ciro asks you to risk your life
for Savastano's son.

159
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,360
And I don't understand
why you risk so much for him.

160
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,600
We're not doing this for Gennaro,
but for us. To settle the score.

161
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:31,640
And without his drugs, we'll become
what we were before all this: street boys.

162
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,760
Would that be so bad?

163
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,800
Right now it would.

164
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,400
If something happens to you, anything...

165
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,200
I will kill them all.

166
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,000
Wait here.

167
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,120
Go.

168
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,160
After the railway bridge,
the crockery warehouse in San Giovanni.

169
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,680
A crockery warehouse,
after the railway bridge.

170
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,600
What's the matter? Isn't Ciro there?

171
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,720
He didn't show up.

172
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,360
Then we'll let you die alone.

173
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,800
- Stop.
- Weapons down.

174
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,240
- Throw away your gun.
- Put it down, assholes.

175
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,400
Freeze, or I'll kill you.

176
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,880
I'm going to kill you.

177
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,200
- Freeze, motherfucker.
- Put it down.

178
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,000
On the ground.

179
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,360
On the ground, now.

180
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,160
I'm not alone.

181
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,080
Call him and tell him
everything is alright.

182
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,040
Do you want to be a hero?

183
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:28,800
Any more heroes?

184
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,560
Starting tomorrow,
your neighborhood is ours.

185
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:44,920
Everyone gets a job, a house and a car.

186
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,000
And our respect.

187
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,280
Call him.

188
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,680
Tell him Ciro and I are dead,
and he is too.

189
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,600
Where is Patrizia?

190
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,520
Come on, we have to go.

191
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,000
Come to daddy.
We have to leave here.

192
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,240
What is it?

193
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,720
Did you think I betrayed you?

194
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,280
They're back.

195
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,040
That's Ciro.

196
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,600
NEXT TIME

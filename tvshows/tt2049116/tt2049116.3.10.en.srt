1
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,079
Where's Pietro's fishy?

2
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,759
Here it is! Here's the ducky!

3
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,879
- Hi, Dad.
- Take the boy out.

4
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,279
Why?

5
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,359
I told you to take him out.

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,799
- I'm bathing him.
- Take him out, hurry up.

7
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,559
Come on, sweetie.

8
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,519
Easy...

9
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,239
Let go of me!

10
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,639
No!

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,079
Pietro!

12
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,199
Let go of me!

13
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,239
Don't hurt him!

14
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,519
Why him? Why Pietro, Dad?

15
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,519
'Cause you've already decided
whose side you're on.

16
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,879
My baby, no!

17
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,319
Not my baby!

18
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,959
What's happening?

19
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,839
Our son's in your hands now.

20
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,079
My father...

21
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,319
says you have to speak to his friends.

22
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,639
Gennaro...

23
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,759
If anything happens to him...

24
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,999
I'll never forgive you.

25
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,519
Gennaro, what happened?

26
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,159
Call Patrizia.

27
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,839
Are you Gennaro Savastano's
messenger?

28
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,759
Yes.

29
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,199
Lil' Genny's enjoying doing things
without showing his face.

30
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,559
And why did he pick you?

31
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,879
I was his father's messenger.

32
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,439
Unfortunately, Gennaro Savastano

33
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,639
is not a person of substance
like his father.

34
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,839
He mistook Don Avitabile's
kindness for stupidity.

35
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,359
Gennaro's an arsehole,
who doesn't know how to behave.

36
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,279
- He needs to learn.
- You're teachers now!

37
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,999
Do me a favour.

38
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,839
Tell me what you want in exchange
for the kid.

39
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,199
And let's not waste time.

40
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,799
Let's get it over with.
It's better for him and for you.

41
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,559
The Confederates know everything.

42
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,559
We knew this could happen
and we took it into account.

43
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,839
But who knew that shitbag Avitabile
would give my son to the Confederates!

44
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,679
There's nothing we can do.
We gotta give 'em what they want.

45
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,999
I know, but what they want
isn't something I can control.

46
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,319
What do they want?

47
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,439
That you buy from the Confederates,
through the Capaccios at their price.

48
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,239
In exchange, you give them
40% of your earnings.

49
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,479
You keep Forcella,
but you can't deal outside.

50
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,679
So now we have to be under
the Confederates.

51
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,839
Did anyone tell you to speak?
Then keep quiet.

52
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,279
There's no solution.
Gennaro can't sell to us anymore.

53
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,879
And he can't even go to war
along with us.

54
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,559
Do you realise what you're asking?

55
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,519
Enzo's supposed to shake hands
with Carmela's killer?

56
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,039
Does everyone in here have to talk?

57
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,959
If you don't do what I say,
you'll be alone in this war.

58
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,399
And if you're alone,
this is what happens.

59
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,559
I swear on my life...

60
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,319
we'll get revenge for Carmela.

61
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,159
We got a message from Enzo.

62
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,439
When's he getting discharged?

63
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,799
Tomorrow.

64
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,319
- Can they save his eye?
- They don't know yet.

65
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,239
He sent us here
to tell you something straight off.

66
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,879
He says we gotta stop,

67
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,319
and we gotta go under the Confederates.

68
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,159
Why?

69
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,959
Because that's what Ciro Di Marzio
and Gennaro Savastano want.

70
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,159
That's the shit you gotta eat
when you enter the System.

71
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,519
But we're something else.

72
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,439
I'm not from Forcella.

73
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,759
I was born and raised far from here,

74
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,079
and I'm different from you all.

75
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,279
But you picked me to be your friend,

76
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,159
and what does being friends mean?

77
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,159
Following the same path together.

78
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,159
That's what friends do.

79
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,999
We agreed to walk beside Ciro
Di Marzio and Gennaro Savastano

80
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,319
and today they're asking us to stop.

81
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,959
We're friends with them, so we'll stop.

82
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,319
But starting tomorrow
we go our own way.

83
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,999
And if they don't want to follow us,

84
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,119
it means they're not friends with us.

85
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,799
Let's go.

86
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,359
I love you all.

87
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,839
You guys are on the ball.

88
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,479
You guys put your heart into it.

89
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,319
You're guys who go into battle
and play hard.

90
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,279
But if any of you is still thinking
of fucking us over,

91
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,479
he's barking up the wrong tree.

92
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,999
Opportunity makes the thief.

93
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,879
But to avoid giving you the opportunity,
know what we'll do?

94
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,359
We'll go with you.

95
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,759
That way the instructions
will be clear for everybody.

96
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,999
What do you mean you'll go with us?
That wasn't the deal.

97
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,239
Doesn't he speak nice?
He's studied.

98
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,439
He hasn't studied enough
if he asks questions like that.

99
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,719
So, I'll explain it to him.

100
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,599
How do we know that you'll give us 40%
and you won't screw us?

101
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,159
We'll put our people on your tail.

102
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,119
You collect in front of them.
That way we're all cool,

103
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,719
you and us.

104
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,719
What's the word in Secondigliano,
Lady Annalisa?

105
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,799
It caused a big stink.

106
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,319
Touching someone's kids
is like tearing their heart out.

107
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,879
Wealth, power...

108
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,559
It's all about feelings.

109
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,319
That's why Gennaro Savastano
is on his knees.

110
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,119
Let's drink a toast.

111
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,959
Don Edoardo...

112
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,319
The time's come for a woman
to rule in Secondigliano again.

113
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,519
The Charmer told us
you're holding a wild card.

114
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,919
I need to see it.

115
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,079
Not that I don't trust you,
but you understand...

116
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,719
We need to see all the cards
to play this game.

117
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,479
You're right, Don Ruggero,

118
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,599
we need to go see the cards.

119
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,199
My wild card's here.

120
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,399
Wasn't she
Gennaro Savastano's messenger?

121
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,799
Patrizia is a bright girl,

122
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,719
whereas Gennaro's a halfwit,
and he trusts her.

123
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,959
So?

124
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,439
Gennaro's stopped everything.

125
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,919
He did the right thing.
That was the deal.

126
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,519
With all due respect,

127
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,959
this is a card we need to play well.

128
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,879
What do you mean?

129
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,239
Gennaro Savastano needs
to be patient for a while longer.

130
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,639
We lost a lot of money
because of him.

131
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,559
True. Besides, Gennaro never
gives a shit about agreements.

132
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,999
I think that...

133
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,599
compensation for lost income
is fair enough.

134
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,919
They're not happy
with what you've made up to now.

135
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,119
They want another three million.

136
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,959
I knew it!

137
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,239
Those pieces of shit!

138
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,199
I think you should accept.
It's all you can do.

139
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,799
Obviously I've got to accept.
We're talking about my son!

140
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,799
Now I need you to stay
closer than ever.

141
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,159
Keep your eyes open.

142
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,759
I want to know how he is.

143
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,559
Will you tell me how he is?

144
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,559
Has he eaten?

145
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,479
Did he sleep?

146
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,519
Did he cry last night?

147
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,919
Did you give him
his special blanket to sleep with?

148
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,679
Tell me!

149
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,759
If Pietro doesn't come back...

150
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,719
I'll kill you.

151
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,799
Let's start delivering this.

152
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,399
Let's go.

153
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,559
The Confederates' stuff is shit.

154
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,759
We'll lose our whole market in a week.

155
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,719
We just need to hold on a bit longer.

156
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,959
See you later.

157
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,399
What's wrong, Cantonese?
You don't look too sure.

158
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,919
What if someone notices?
Did you hear Crazy?

159
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,199
Who's gonna notice?
We weren't born to be his slaves.

160
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,159
Bro', we're in a storm

161
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,479
and our captain
is letting the boat drift.

162
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,319
But there's only two of us, you and me.
Where do we start?

163
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,399
If you've changed your mind, go home.

164
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,399
I haven't changed my mind.
I'm with you. Let's go.

165
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,039
- Can we trust him?
- The doctor's the best courier.

166
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,599
He's riddled with debt
and he's scared of us. He won't talk.

167
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,799
And he's got fuck-all to do
with what goes on here, don't worry.

168
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,719
Hi there, all good?

169
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,319
All good.

170
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,239
You'll get a new shipment.

171
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,119
Take care, Doc.

172
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,799
Goodbye.

173
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,440
Azzurra?

174
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,159
Gennaro...

175
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,039
What's happening?
Why isn't Pietro back?

176
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,239
I'm doing everything they tell me to.

177
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,279
I know what a father
who plays with his son's life is like.

178
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,039
I know and I'll never forget it.

179
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,079
Bring back my son.

180
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,639
- Hi, Mum, all good?
- Yeah, you?

181
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,319
Go play in there.

182
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,159
All done?

183
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,279
We gotta push it right now.
It's just you and me.

184
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,079
Careful, it's all the money
I've made since I came back.

185
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,279
Don't worry.

186
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,959
They fucked up.

187
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,519
- They didn't keep up their end, huh?
- No.

188
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,239
It went like you said.

189
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,759
Those fucking beards...

190
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,279
I counted it, it's all there.

191
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,479
Well done, Gennaro.

192
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,639
There's a problem though. Right?

193
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,199
What problem is that?

194
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,479
Gennaro's guys didn't stick to the deal.

195
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,279
The kid's not coming back for now.

196
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,199
Tell them to leave.

197
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,999
Leave the room, please.

198
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,479
Where are the other two?

199
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,399
You can talk to me.

200
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,559
You speak for them?

201
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,679
Here I am.

202
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,879
Then I'll kill you first.

203
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,959
The Confederates want
someone to be made an example of

204
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,719
and we gotta do it,

205
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,399
or they'll throw my son
into a meat grinder.

206
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,839
I know you're mad, I would be too.

207
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,359
Ronni and Cantonese made a big
mistake and I apologise for them.

208
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,759
But in this war...

209
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,879
I'm the first to lose flesh and blood.

210
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,599
I can't support you
because they're brothers,

211
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,759
and if I allow you to go ahead,
two rebels will become a hundred.

212
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,679
That's what the Confederates want,

213
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,959
for you to turn on each other.

214
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,799
For you to spit in your friends' faces.

215
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,479
Well, if that's what they want,

216
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,279
that's what we'll give them.

217
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,559
Enough!

218
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,679
You good with that?

219
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,959
Tell the Wizard that my son
needs to go back to his mother.

220
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,759
They killed me for real.

221
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,359
Fuck up again
and you'll have me to answer to.

222
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,759
Hurry up.

223
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,639
The kid won't be touched.

224
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,919
What are you saying, Don Ruggero?

225
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,839
What's right.

226
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,919
Gennaro did what he was supposed to.

227
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,199
The kid can go home.

228
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,439
Don Edoardo says if we keep going,
we'll knock him out for good.

229
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:21,839
The Charmer's grown tight with Crazy
and the Graduate, and I let him.

230
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,559
For a moment,
I forgot that the Wizard

231
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,679
has always kept his word.

232
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,679
And it's gotta go back
to being like that, now and forever!

233
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,799
Wait.

234
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,359
Oh, my God!

235
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,839
Pietro! Sweetheart!

236
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,439
Hello, my darling!

237
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,479
Hello, Mummy's sweetheart.

238
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,119
My life! Sweetheart!

239
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,039
Hello, my darling.

240
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,919
It won't be long, Mummy's boy.

241
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,439
We're going away. It won't be long.

242
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,559
Are you happy?

243
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,479
- Lady Annalisa.
- Patrizia! It's you!

244
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,999
I've been expecting you.
We need to drink a toast.

245
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,359
Hold on.

246
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,479
Come here.

247
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,119
You did a great job.

248
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,039
You got him to where we need him.

249
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,959
How did you do it?

250
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,639
How did you manage

251
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,239
to take in Gennaro so easily?

252
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,839
I simply told him the truth.

253
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,599
Now the good part's coming.
We end him the way he deserves.

254
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,319
But now you need to be careful, Patrizia.

255
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,519
You gotta play the part
'til the very end.

256
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,679
Gennaro's trust in you
needs to be stoked like a fire

257
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,679
until the moment arrives.

258
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,479
Don't worry, Lady Annalisa,
I know how to wait.

259
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,199
I know.

260
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,959
I know perfectly well.

261
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,239
That's why you need to stay by my side.

262
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,879
Patrizia...

263
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,559
Have you got a boyfriend?

264
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,079
No.

265
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,119
That's how it should be.

266
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,799
You're not cut out
to be somebody's woman.

267
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,919
You need to stay with me forever.

268
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,959
To the new queen of Secondigliano!

269
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,559
Cheers.

270
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,079
COMING UP

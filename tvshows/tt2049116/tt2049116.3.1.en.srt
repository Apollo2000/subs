1
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,799
Is it over?

2
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,839
Now I'll take care of it.

3
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,679
Come to Daddy.

4
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,039
It could only have been him.

5
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,759
We gotta find
that idiot Ciro Di Marzio.

6
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,239
And all his men too,

7
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,919
before Genny asks us
why his father is dead and we're not.

8
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,759
And I need some big bicycles

9
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,359
for my kids, one's nine
and the other's seven and a half.

10
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,719
Hurry up.

11
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,399
Let's go.

12
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,039
He said he was coming back,
but he's not here yet.

13
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,976
- It's all under control.
- Are you bullshitting me?

14
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,399
- It's all under control.
- That's not true.

15
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,999
I need to know.

16
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,159
What happened to Pietro?

17
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,719
You just need to stay calm, Patrizia.

18
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,599
Pietro's been shot,

19
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,919
but he's OK.

20
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,119
But now it's all up to me,

21
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,839
and I need your help
or else it's gonna be war.

22
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,479
- I have to see him!
- Not now!

23
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,839
When you get out, I'll be here.

24
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,559
What?

25
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,999
I haven't been able to reach my father
since yesterday.

26
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,919
I've got to find him.

27
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,679
Be good.

28
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,439
Let's go.

29
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,879
Hey, you!
Have you seen Fernando?

30
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,199
Hey, guys!

31
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,079
Have you seen Fernando?

32
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,159
Ciro Di Marzio's disappeared.

33
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,759
Those shitbags have gone.

34
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,079
Lello split at dawn,
took his family with him.

35
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,719
Pitbull got a loan paid back

36
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,879
and he left Secondigliano last night.

37
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,079
Fernando's lying low at his sister's,
but he's about to clear out.

38
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,279
We gotta go get 'em now.

39
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,199
- Uncle Fernando?
- Yes?

40
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,599
- I'm hungry.
- Wait!

41
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,639
Where the fuck is...?

42
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,239
First I'll kill you,
then I'll come after your kids.

43
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,119
Move it.

44
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,359
Wait here.

45
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,199
- Want some more pasta?
- All right.

46
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,879
Quick, hurry up.

47
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,759
Don't do anything dumb.

48
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,719
Fernando, run!

49
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,119
Come here, you piece of shit.

50
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,599
- Where's your boss?
- I don't know.

51
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,479
We split the money.

52
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,919
- Now go get him, I don't care how.
- How can I?

53
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,759
I'll get your family up here
and throw them off one by one.

54
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,439
Piece of shit!

55
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,359
I'm supposed to bring him a passport.

56
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,079
Good.

57
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,079
Patrizia?

58
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,519
What the fuck are you on about?

59
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,479
Where will I meet you?

60
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,079
OK.

61
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,239
Get out, Patrizia.

62
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,639
I want to know where my father is.

63
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,279
Is he hurt?

64
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,039
Is he hurt, or is he dead?

65
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,599
What?

66
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,879
You were supposed
to bring him back alive.

67
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,399
Or you should've died with him.
That's what a good soldier does.

68
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,119
I shouldn't have listened to your father.

69
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,280
If I'd gone into the cemetery with him,
he'd still be alive.

70
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,519
I'd die for my family.

71
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,839
I'll find the bastard that shot
your father, and I'll fuck him up.

72
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,679
Ciro Di Marzio.

73
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,839
And how did Ciro Di Marzio find out?

74
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,239
Maybe he had us followed
like he did with Patrizia.

75
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,839
But Patrizia noticed straight away

76
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,559
and saved my father's life,
and you didn't see shit.

77
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,039
Maybe no one was following him,
but they were waiting for him outside.

78
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,479
Someone told them
you and Pietro were meeting up.

79
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,119
You know what they say, Malammò?

80
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,479
The viceroy becomes
the king's worst enemy.

81
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,959
They also say that at the king's funeral,
the only one not weeping is his son.

82
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,439
Yeah, well,
this son carries his tears inside.

83
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,639
Anyway, now this son's in charge.

84
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,559
The first thing he needs to know is
who are friends and who are enemies.

85
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,400
This one.

86
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,799
I've packed my things.

87
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,959
After the funeral I'll take them away.

88
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,719
No one's kicking you out.

89
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,599
Stay if you like, we'll find you job.

90
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,079
I wasn't working for the System.

91
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,039
I was with Pietro and that's it.

92
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,079
Do what you want.

93
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,239
You gotta get away from here.

94
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,519
You got a wife, you just had a kid.

95
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,479
You can't live here.

96
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,439
Here people die and that's it.

97
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,239
My father wasn't killed
by Ciro Di Marzio.

98
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,559
What killed him
was the poison we all carry inside.

99
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,279
We know it's there,

100
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,839
but we just can't spit it out.

101
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,639
- What are you thinking?
- I just want peace in the hood.

102
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,159
I know you well.

103
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,519
You lied when you said Don Pietro
was alive and you're lying now.

104
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,839
I've been with them for 30 years,

105
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,319
I obey good ideas and bad ideas.

106
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,999
For him I secured myself place in hell
by killing a little girl.

107
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,719
I'm tired, I'm old,
I don't want to be under them.

108
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,759
You're making a mistake.

109
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,719
What happened in the hood
taught us one thing.

110
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,159
You don't touch the Savastanos.

111
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,159
We're ready.

112
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,519
My mother was 16 when she had me,

113
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,399
I never knew my father.

114
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,279
I'm the child of a mistake,
a child of bad love.

115
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,199
Me and Don Pietro knew each other
since we were kids, like brothers.

116
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,599
But he was like a father to me.

117
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,639
He said, no one gives you anything in
life, you gotta take what you want.

118
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,959
And so we did, always together.

119
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,799
But now we've all got to behave

120
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,599
because he's here
and he sees everything.

121
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,919
Always.

122
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
Always.

123
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,199
Fernando called, we gotta hurry.

124
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,439
I know where he is.

125
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,719
I'm coming tonight.

126
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,879
Give the baby a kiss from me.

127
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,959
See you later.

128
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,679
The door must always be open,
but it needs to seem closed.

129
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,279
Move it.

130
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,919
I gotta shoot that idiot.

131
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,479
You stay here, in case
those sons of bitches show up.

132
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,399
Where are you going now?

133
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,959
I don't know.

134
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,879
I killed my daughter too.

135
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,799
I need to pay for what I did.

136
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,959
Ciro.

137
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,959
- Good morning, Don Aniello.
- My condolences.

138
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,319
Thank you.

139
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,319
Our condolences.

140
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,999
I'm sorry to bother you
at such a bad time.

141
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,039
Elia Capaccio
and his brother Ferdinando.

142
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,359
- Do they belong to you?
- They're my grandsons.

143
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,679
And this is Don Eduardo Arenella.

144
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,759
Pleasure.

145
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,999
Pleasure's all mine, Don Gennaro.

146
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:56,399
We asked for this meeting
because we're a little worried.

147
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,559
Without your father,

148
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,199
and with you in Rome,

149
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,639
Secondigliano and Scampia
are like a ticking time bomb,

150
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,199
they could go off at anytime.

151
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,359
With no one in charge,
anarchy would reign in North Naples.

152
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,479
Another war would hurt everyone
and us too.

153
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,599
We've always behaved at home.

154
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,239
My father said that Sanità
and the Maddalena

155
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,999
are the neighborhoods
where there's the most money, right?

156
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,999
We can't complain.

157
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,679
But he was in love
with the Spanish Quarters and Forcella.

158
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,120
He said that you could only get
the true smell of Naples there.

159
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,239
Your father was right.

160
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,159
But the heart of this city is the port.

161
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,679
It can open doors to the whole world.

162
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,799
Now...

163
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,039
The war's over in my house
and I'm in charge.

164
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,079
We never stuck our nose in your business,
we've always respected you.

165
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,399
And you need to do the same.

166
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,759
And that's what we wanted to know.

167
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,439
Actually, there's something else.

168
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,359
The White.

169
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,759
Who are you giving it to?

170
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,719
My stuff?

171
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,679
From Rome down, it's just for me
and for you, all right?

172
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,879
I consider it a pledge.

173
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,639
- Hey.
- Gennaro.

174
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,839
You're here...

175
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,279
I'm here.

176
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,319
Daddy's boy.

177
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,719
Let's go.

178
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,759
- Everything OK?
- Yeah, all good.

179
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,919
- When do you have to come back?
- Tomorrow.

180
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,959
Come.

181
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,119
Here we are.

182
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,239
What are we doing here?

183
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:43,279
You made me a prince,
so this is how I treat you.

184
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,159
Come.

185
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,399
Gennaro!

186
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,039
It's beautiful!

187
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,519
How'd you do it?

188
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:24,399
I found an old friend, Gegè.

189
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,839
He studied in England,
but he's from Secondigliano.

190
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,439
He's the top guy for real estate deals.

191
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,519
Is there a room for Pietro?

192
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,399
He's little now,
he needs to stay close to his dad.

193
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,279
Last night,
my brother hung himself in his cell.

194
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,919
He retracted his accusations
against Don Giuseppe.

195
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,719
I'm sorry.

196
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,999
Without him
those accusations are worthless.

197
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,199
And Don Giuseppe
would already be at home, if...

198
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,839
If what?

199
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,519
The judge got it into his head
that my brother didn't kill himself.

200
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,559
So what does he want?

201
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,439
More investigations.

202
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,159
He can't keep him in jail all that time.

203
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,479
He's frozen all our assets,
he wants us on criminal association.

204
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,079
He can keep him in jail until the
tax police finish their checks.

205
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,239
Really? Gennaro, can he do that?

206
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,759
To avoid evidence
being tampered with, yeah.

207
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,839
How long will it take?

208
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,239
The lawyer said about a year.

209
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,559
Does Don Giuseppe know all this?

210
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,319
Yes.

211
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,679
- How'd he take it?
- Not well.

212
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,439
But he knows he can count on you.

213
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,159
It's not true that my dad left Naples.

214
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,159
My dad's dead.

215
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,279
I had him killed.

216
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,279
He wanted me under him
in Secondigliano,

217
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,119
he'd never have accepted anything else.

218
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,119
In the end, he went crazy,
he saw dead people everywhere.

219
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,159
We were in danger too.

220
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,039
So I did the only thing I could do.

221
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,719
I protected my family.

222
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,879
I paid the price like you paid the price.

223
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,159
Now it's just us, Gennaro.

224
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,359
That's what matters.

225
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,199

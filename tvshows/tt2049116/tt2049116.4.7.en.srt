00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:34,342
- Enzo! Glad you came.
- Congratulations.

3
00:00:34,347 --> 00:00:36,625
Thank you. Come.

4
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:39,109
- Hi, Rosa.
- Hi, Enzo.

5
00:00:40,311 --> 00:00:41,829
He's beautiful.

6
00:00:41,832 --> 00:00:45,030
He doesn't look like you at all,
good thing he took after Rosa.

7
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:47,193
Good thing, for real!

8
00:00:47,196 --> 00:00:49,994
Enzo, I'm going to get the party favors.

9
00:00:49,998 --> 00:00:53,116
We gotta celebrate something else
and we gotta hurry.

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,478
- The first one to become a dad?
- No, when the drugs arrive.

11
00:00:56,483 --> 00:00:58,801
When and if they arrive.

12
00:00:58,804 --> 00:01:02,322
- Do you know?
- Patrizia said a month, it's up.

13
00:01:02,327 --> 00:01:05,525
But the fucking Capaccios
bought stuff on their own

14
00:01:05,529 --> 00:01:07,527
and they're expanding
behind our backs.

15
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,528
Wait 'til the stuff gets here
then we'll be laughing again.

16
00:01:10,532 --> 00:01:12,490
What's there to laugh about?

17
00:01:12,494 --> 00:01:15,692
The problem's not
that there's no drugs, but why.

18
00:01:15,696 --> 00:01:19,294
Secondigliano's in the shit,
they even had a rat in the house.

19
00:01:19,298 --> 00:01:22,936
- What if nothing turns up?
- What do you think, Valerio?

20
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:25,379
Unfortunately, it's not up to me.

21
00:01:25,383 --> 00:01:27,863
Enzo...

22
00:01:29,345 --> 00:01:31,223
Why the long faces?

23
00:01:31,227 --> 00:01:34,627
Today we all gotta celebrate,
our family's growing.

24
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:39,108
I know some are worried,
but I found a contact.

25
00:01:39,112 --> 00:01:43,110
While we wait for Patrizia's shipment,
our ass is covered.

26
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:47,273
- But we gotta pay in cash.
- And where do we get it?

27
00:01:47,278 --> 00:01:48,756
You'll see.

28
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:52,039
Now let's celebrate,
let's take a picture.

29
00:01:53,922 --> 00:01:55,802
Give it up for Top Model!

30
00:01:57,885 --> 00:01:59,805
Thanks, guys!

31
00:02:07,172 --> 00:02:09,532
You ready? Make it snappy!

32
00:02:39,354 --> 00:02:43,152
This machine gun's a beast,
I'm gonna raise hell.

33
00:02:43,157 --> 00:02:46,355
Get your piece outta my face.
The fuck are you doing?

34
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:47,837
Can you smell shit too?

35
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,678
Top Model needs to change his diaper.

36
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:51,799
Get off my ass!

37
00:02:51,803 --> 00:02:55,201
- You scared, Goliath?
- He's forgotten how to shoot.

38
00:02:55,205 --> 00:02:58,043
- When did he ever know how to shoot?
- Suck my dick!

39
00:02:58,047 --> 00:03:00,605
Top Model's momma sucks dicks!

40
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:02,567
- Jerk-off!
- Knock it off.

41
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,608
You always take it out on his mother!

42
00:03:04,611 --> 00:03:06,769
- What's with you?
- You're a dickhead.

43
00:03:06,773 --> 00:03:10,291
A little exercise will do us all good.

44
00:03:10,295 --> 00:03:13,813
- Speak for yourself, with that gut!
- I'm on a diet.

45
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:17,456
I was just fine in bed
with a tit in my mouth.

46
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,340
You got that right.

47
00:03:21,023 --> 00:03:23,303
What's wrong, Valerio,
you wanna go home?

48
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:28,984
You're so serious...
You wanna spoil the party?

49
00:03:28,988 --> 00:03:32,148
Why, are we going to a party?

50
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:47,359
The armored truck's
entering the tunnel.

51
00:03:51,484 --> 00:03:53,564
You wanna get out?

52
00:03:56,768 --> 00:04:00,526
It's too late,
there's no taxis at this hour.

53
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,330
Walking's a drag.

54
00:04:04,813 --> 00:04:07,211
So let's do it.

55
00:04:07,215 --> 00:04:09,493
- "Walking is a drag..."
- He's a legend!

56
00:04:09,496 --> 00:04:11,616
Let's do this, game on.

57
00:04:47,243 --> 00:04:49,161
Get out!

58
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,242
Come on, guys!

59
00:04:51,245 --> 00:04:56,405
Get out! Get out!

60
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,890
Get outta there!

61
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:04,653
Fuckers, they got an escort!

62
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:09,376
Guys!

63
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:14,257
- Quick!
- Come!

64
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:16,019
Guys, come on!

65
00:05:16,023 --> 00:05:18,343
Quick!

66
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:27,629
Motherfuckers!

67
00:05:31,353 --> 00:05:34,271
The cops! We gotta go!

68
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:36,475
Hurry!

69
00:06:01,774 --> 00:06:03,094
Close it!

70
00:06:07,818 --> 00:06:10,336
Come on, quick!

71
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,140
Call the doctor!

72
00:06:13,462 --> 00:06:15,302
Get the scooter.

73
00:06:16,745 --> 00:06:19,785
- Let's hurry.
- Go!

74
00:06:25,271 --> 00:06:26,591
Close it!

75
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,917
Go.

76
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,638
Get off here.

77
00:06:41,642 --> 00:06:43,960
Go, hurry up!

78
00:06:43,964 --> 00:06:46,884
We'll wait for you over there. Go!

79
00:06:49,207 --> 00:06:50,727
Move!

80
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,810
C'mon, let's get him on the gurney.

81
00:06:59,494 --> 00:07:02,854
- Hold him here!
- Hurry!

82
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:07,058
Quick.

83
00:07:10,822 --> 00:07:12,622
You can't come in here.

84
00:07:27,354 --> 00:07:29,752
Enzo...

85
00:07:29,755 --> 00:07:31,995
We gotta call Rosa.

86
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:38,157
Let's wait 'til he makes it
and we can give her the good news.

87
00:07:38,161 --> 00:07:40,481
Did you see the state he's in?

88
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:44,724
I said he's gonna make it.

89
00:07:48,248 --> 00:07:51,566
Do you see why we can't afford
any more fuckups?

90
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,930
You shoulda known they had an escort.

91
00:07:55,613 --> 00:07:58,691
I know what I have to do.

92
00:07:58,695 --> 00:08:00,415
I don't think so.

93
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:04,976
When Nicola came to talk to us,
you ignored him.

94
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:09,258
Again? You know what your problem is?
You see shit that's not there.

95
00:08:09,263 --> 00:08:12,781
Fine, Enzo, do what you want.

96
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:15,465
But sooner or later,
they'll get sick of it.

97
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:18,386
They?

98
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:22,309
If there's anyone changing
their mind, it's you.

99
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:14,907
What?

100
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,518
Sasà...

101
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,010
What's happened?

102
00:10:49,454 --> 00:10:50,894
Where's Sasà?

103
00:11:22,597 --> 00:11:24,797
You happy now?

104
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,439
You happy now?

105
00:11:35,646 --> 00:11:37,406
Let's go in.

106
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:34,525
Bro'...

107
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,093
Bro'...

108
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:56,137
Pure'n'Simple, Sasà woulda done
anything for Enzo,

109
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,220
he woulda even gone to hell.

110
00:12:58,223 --> 00:12:59,901
For real.

111
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,584
Luckily, only he died.

112
00:13:06,028 --> 00:13:09,066
The fuck you looking at, Pure'n'Simple?

113
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:11,229
Enzo's at home,

114
00:13:11,232 --> 00:13:15,430
on that nice sofa he bought
without even doing a mugging.

115
00:13:15,435 --> 00:13:17,833
Are you serious?

116
00:13:17,837 --> 00:13:19,755
Enzo has nothing to do with it,

117
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:23,356
no one could have known
what was gonna happen.

118
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,198
He wants to order everyone around.

119
00:13:25,202 --> 00:13:27,922
Then I say he's responsible
for Top Model's death.

120
00:13:30,205 --> 00:13:32,125
Is that what you think, Goliath?

121
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,169
He's not the only one, Pure'n'Simple.

122
00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:55,221
We'll pretend I didn't hear that.

123
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:11,429
- I nearly went for him.
- You shouldn't talk in front of Valerio.

124
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,994
What are you talking about?

125
00:14:16,717 --> 00:14:21,355
- I agree with you.
- Why didn't you say anything?

126
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,239
A brother died.

127
00:14:24,243 --> 00:14:27,683
Instead of flinging shit at each other,
we gotta do something.

128
00:14:28,686 --> 00:14:32,364
I don't want to put Enzo on the spot,
I want him to think.

129
00:14:32,368 --> 00:14:36,006
- What the fuck is there to think about?
- About what Nicola tried to tell us.

130
00:14:36,011 --> 00:14:37,331
He was a rat.

131
00:14:39,693 --> 00:14:46,131
That's what Patrizia says.
But I saw him and so did you.

132
00:14:46,138 --> 00:14:50,376
He was talking like he was scared
not like he wanted to screw you.

133
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:52,541
So what do you think?

134
00:14:54,784 --> 00:14:58,702
Didn't you say the Capaccios
are taking our turf?

135
00:14:58,707 --> 00:15:00,907
So what do we do?

136
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:10,511
Enzo's a brother, but he's not a boss.

137
00:15:10,515 --> 00:15:13,993
And I don't want to die because
no one's got the balls to tell him.

138
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:18,115
- I want to talk to the Capaccios.
- You want to make a deal with them?

139
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,278
I want to know what they're up to.

140
00:15:21,282 --> 00:15:23,962
And I want to know if they're
the only ones behind the bust.

141
00:15:25,565 --> 00:15:26,885
And then?

142
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,767
And then we can decide on our future,

143
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:37,328
whether to stay with them
or with Patrizia or go our own way.

144
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,131
You don't want to tell Enzo?

145
00:15:39,135 --> 00:15:42,575
When it's done we'll tell him,
he'll just have to accept it.

146
00:15:55,586 --> 00:16:00,224
Goliath doesn't know what he's saying.
It's the grief talking.

147
00:16:00,229 --> 00:16:02,627
I know.

148
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:05,351
It's what Valerio says that worries me.

149
00:16:07,194 --> 00:16:09,274
Didn't Valerio tell you anything?

150
00:16:10,797 --> 00:16:13,357
No need, I can read his mind.

151
00:16:19,643 --> 00:16:21,763
He thinks it's my fault.

152
00:16:25,207 --> 00:16:26,607
What is it?

153
00:16:32,011 --> 00:16:34,011
We gotta see something.

154
00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:00,869
It's Secondigliano.
The drugs have arrived.

155
00:17:03,433 --> 00:17:05,833
You'll see, it'll be all right now.

156
00:17:33,614 --> 00:17:35,294
It's here!

157
00:18:03,795 --> 00:18:05,635
Guys, let's unload.

158
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:11,476
Easy with this stuff.

159
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,600
Say hello to Donna Patrizia.

160
00:18:15,403 --> 00:18:17,523
Quick, go.

161
00:18:30,053 --> 00:18:32,333
Hurry up.

162
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:43,381
Bro', finally.

163
00:18:47,505 --> 00:18:49,785
Guys, open this shit.

164
00:18:55,231 --> 00:18:57,231
Check out the trash...

165
00:18:58,793 --> 00:19:01,233
That's gross!

166
00:19:03,156 --> 00:19:05,996
Where's Valerio?
Anyone heard from him?

167
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,760
You know he's delicate.
He's probably sleeping.

168
00:19:15,845 --> 00:19:17,525
Smells like shit.

169
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,418
Now you want to talk to us again?

170
00:20:38,422 --> 00:20:40,780
This guy does what the fuck he wants.

171
00:20:40,784 --> 00:20:44,382
He wants to talk,
then he doesn't want to talk...

172
00:20:44,386 --> 00:20:47,266
Elia, I don't know
if I want to listen to him.

173
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:56,589
I know you've never liked Patrizia.
It's all the same to me.

174
00:20:56,595 --> 00:20:59,113
In Secondigliano they're raking in
the cash, and we're scraping by.

175
00:20:59,116 --> 00:21:02,716
If you came to tell us what
we already know, you can leave.

176
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,440
Nicola told us the seized shipment
went back on the streets.

177
00:21:09,444 --> 00:21:14,522
I don't know, Elia...
Why did Nicola go talk to him?

178
00:21:14,527 --> 00:21:17,485
Something like that
you'd tell your boss.

179
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:20,329
Unless you don't trust your boss
anymore either.

180
00:21:22,252 --> 00:21:24,730
And do you know why?

181
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:26,772
Nicola knew that behind the seizure

182
00:21:26,776 --> 00:21:29,174
there's someone
who doesn't like this truce

183
00:21:29,177 --> 00:21:32,697
because he wants Patrizia
out of the way, like I do.

184
00:21:35,902 --> 00:21:38,460
And you think it's us?

185
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:41,464
I think you play an important role
in this game.

186
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:53,189
- And what do you want to do?
- An alliance.

187
00:21:53,194 --> 00:21:55,794
With you and with those
who are with you.

188
00:21:57,317 --> 00:22:00,357
And if we do that, others will follow.

189
00:22:08,925 --> 00:22:10,525
Let us think about it.

190
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:13,687
We'll let you know.

191
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:17,249
Take him outside.

192
00:22:23,215 --> 00:22:25,495
This guy wants
to take Blue Blood's place.

193
00:22:26,617 --> 00:22:28,697
Son of a bitch!

194
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,100
Friends... Friends, my ass!

195
00:22:34,983 --> 00:22:37,621
Can we trust him?

196
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,905
Last time he ran riot.

197
00:22:41,587 --> 00:22:43,547
But we had fun, right?

198
00:22:48,547 --> 00:22:51,987
This goes to Vicaria Vecchia.
Get it there fast.

199
00:22:59,715 --> 00:23:01,315
This goes to Piazza Calenda.

200
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,239
Come.

201
00:23:08,641 --> 00:23:10,321
Wait.

202
00:23:12,484 --> 00:23:16,842
- Where the fuck have you been?
- I had some problems.

203
00:23:16,847 --> 00:23:18,407
What happened?

204
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:22,887
Papa had a heart attack last night.

205
00:23:22,891 --> 00:23:25,809
- How is he now?
- He's out of danger.

206
00:23:25,813 --> 00:23:28,293
But Mama needs me.

207
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:33,814
You're right, I know how important
it is to have a father.

208
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:35,219
Valerio....

209
00:23:36,701 --> 00:23:38,541
Your bag's there, come with me.

210
00:23:46,307 --> 00:23:50,827
Come. Go to Vico della Pace.

211
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:57,993
- Everything all right?
- He said they'll think about it.

212
00:24:06,882 --> 00:24:10,880
Goliath, if Enzo notices anything,
tell me right away.

213
00:24:10,884 --> 00:24:12,604
Don't worry.

214
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:37,178
One week and we'll get it all back.

215
00:24:37,183 --> 00:24:40,141
We won't get our lost brothers back.

216
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,543
Enzo, you gotta let it go,
Top Model is dead.

217
00:24:43,547 --> 00:24:46,867
Hold your head high and show everybody
we can move forward.

218
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:53,072
I wasn't talking about him.

219
00:24:57,917 --> 00:24:59,917
I was talking about Valerio.

220
00:25:21,613 --> 00:25:24,171
- <i>Yes, who is it?</i>
- A friend of Valerio's.

221
00:25:24,175 --> 00:25:26,293
He said I'd find him here.

222
00:25:26,297 --> 00:25:28,737
<i>After the glass door,
at the back on the left.</i>

223
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:00,398
Who are you? Any news of my son?

224
00:26:02,642 --> 00:26:04,402
Wait!

225
00:26:05,724 --> 00:26:10,282
Why are you looking for him?
What is he doing, what do you know?

226
00:26:10,287 --> 00:26:12,527
Get your hands off me.

227
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:29,179
I need to speak to you.

228
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:42,625
Stay on Valerio's ass,
I need to know if I can still trust him.

229
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:45,670
Tell me everything you find out.

230
00:27:49,116 --> 00:27:51,194
Goliath, what the fuck's going on?

231
00:27:51,197 --> 00:27:54,715
Shouldn't we tell Valerio
Enzo suspects him?

232
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,638
What do we do?

233
00:27:56,641 --> 00:28:00,199
The time's come
to take the situation in our hands.

234
00:28:00,203 --> 00:28:03,603
Trust me, or we'll end up
like our brother.

235
00:28:25,061 --> 00:28:28,019
Dude! I said we'd be in touch.

236
00:28:28,023 --> 00:28:30,741
There's no time,
my friends want an answer now.

237
00:28:30,745 --> 00:28:32,625
Has Enzo noticed anything?

238
00:28:33,867 --> 00:28:36,707
I don't know, but I can't risk it.
We have to hurry.

239
00:28:44,034 --> 00:28:48,512
Listen to me. You're getting yourself
into something bigger than you are.

240
00:28:48,517 --> 00:28:51,675
It's not only us behind this shipment,
there's someone more powerful.

241
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,477
<i>You need to speak to him.</i>

242
00:28:54,481 --> 00:28:57,159
- <i>All cool anyway?</i>
- Yeah.

243
00:28:57,163 --> 00:29:00,081
We'll set up a meeting
for tomorrow night.

244
00:29:00,085 --> 00:29:01,445
All right.

245
00:29:27,384 --> 00:29:31,062
What happened, Valerio?
You couldn't wait 'til tomorrow?

246
00:29:31,066 --> 00:29:34,584
- Did Enzo tell you anything?
- Why?

247
00:29:34,589 --> 00:29:38,147
We gotta hurry, I spoke to Crazy.

248
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:42,591
- What did he say?
- We gotta do it tomorrow night.

249
00:29:44,476 --> 00:29:46,196
The sooner we do it, the better.

250
00:30:10,494 --> 00:30:12,332
What happened?

251
00:30:12,335 --> 00:30:13,853
Well?

252
00:30:13,856 --> 00:30:15,216
Valerio.

253
00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:20,137
Tell me.

254
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:23,020
We did what you asked,
we followed him.

255
00:30:25,664 --> 00:30:28,264
Valerio spoke to the Capaccios.

256
00:30:37,072 --> 00:30:42,352
At this point we want to know.
Is Valerio a brother or not?

257
00:30:46,198 --> 00:30:48,358
He was a brother.

258
00:30:55,805 --> 00:30:57,445
Bring him to me.

259
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:39,992
Hi, Papa.

260
00:31:39,996 --> 00:31:43,676
- Valerio.
- You're always here, huh?

261
00:31:54,606 --> 00:31:56,804
Your mother's losing her mind,
she hasn't seen you for a year.

262
00:31:56,807 --> 00:31:59,565
I'm losing my mind.

263
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:01,967
I can't come home.

264
00:32:01,971 --> 00:32:04,489
Why can't you?

265
00:32:04,493 --> 00:32:08,171
What's going on? Does the guy
who was looking for you come into it?

266
00:32:08,175 --> 00:32:12,173
- Who came?
- A guy with one eye....

267
00:32:12,178 --> 00:32:14,498
Who are these people, Valerio?

268
00:32:22,665 --> 00:32:25,223
You have to do something for me.

269
00:32:25,227 --> 00:32:27,147
Whatever you want.

270
00:34:06,938 --> 00:34:09,696
Wanna speak to those
who want war with Secondigliano?

271
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,700
Here we are, speak.

272
00:34:13,502 --> 00:34:16,180
So Nicola was right,

273
00:34:16,184 --> 00:34:19,622
there really was something big
behind this seizure.

274
00:34:19,626 --> 00:34:21,784
The Levantes.

275
00:34:21,788 --> 00:34:24,108
You got a problem, guys?

276
00:34:27,592 --> 00:34:30,072
The offer's still the same.

277
00:34:31,715 --> 00:34:33,515
Put down your guns.

278
00:34:36,718 --> 00:34:38,638
Don't move.

279
00:34:52,129 --> 00:34:55,047
What's all this show about?

280
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,771
This piece of shit was screwing us all.

281
00:34:59,414 --> 00:35:01,812
He was recording everything
to spy for his boss.

282
00:35:01,816 --> 00:35:03,456
Look in his pockets.

283
00:35:21,389 --> 00:35:24,307
<i>Wanna speak to the people
who want war?</i>

284
00:35:24,311 --> 00:35:25,789
What does that mean?

285
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:30,030
He wanted to ask you to get rid of Enzo
and Patrizia, but it was a trap.

286
00:35:30,035 --> 00:35:34,635
He woulda gone to Enzo with proof
you were behind the bust.

287
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,480
I want to do the deal with you.

288
00:35:41,363 --> 00:35:43,561
We gotta bring Enzo down.

289
00:35:43,565 --> 00:35:46,325
And who says
you won't do the same thing?

290
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,688
No...

291
00:35:53,692 --> 00:35:56,732
You know that Enzo is loyal to Patrizia.

292
00:35:58,255 --> 00:36:00,175
You think she won't respond?

293
00:36:01,417 --> 00:36:03,977
Lower your gun.

294
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,220
Lower it.

295
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:15,465
Is it worth keeping an ally like him...

296
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,790
...instead of an enemy like Enzo?

297
00:36:26,795 --> 00:36:28,515
Let's think about it.

298
00:36:37,642 --> 00:36:39,362
Let's go, Ciccio.

299
00:36:46,448 --> 00:36:48,208
You're lucky.

300
00:36:52,172 --> 00:36:54,412
You're lucky.

301
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:23,553
And Valerio?

302
00:37:30,479 --> 00:37:32,319
He was running away, Enzo.

303
00:37:40,486 --> 00:37:42,006
I'm sorry.

304
00:38:07,304 --> 00:38:09,944
I'll deal with it all,
don't worry about a thing.

305
00:38:11,467 --> 00:38:13,147
Do me a favor.

306
00:38:24,076 --> 00:38:26,196
Valerio has to go home.

307
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,720
Whatever you want.

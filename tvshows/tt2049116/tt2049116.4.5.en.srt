2
00:01:00,715 --> 00:01:03,906
The shipment's past Rome.
- Call me when it arrives.

3
00:01:56,635 --> 00:01:59,408
You're late, it's nearly over.

4
00:02:00,275 --> 00:02:03,115
I ran into traffic.

5
00:02:03,235 --> 00:02:05,595
In Heaven as it is on earth.

6
00:02:05,715 --> 00:02:09,035
Give us this day our daily bread,

7
00:02:09,155 --> 00:02:11,755
forgive us our trespasses

8
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:14,915
as we give those
who trespass against us

9
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:18,975
and lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.

10
00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:24,315
Deliver us, Lord, from every evil,
graciously grant peace in our days,

11
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,915
that, by the help of your mercy,

12
00:02:27,035 --> 00:02:30,435
we may be always free from sin
and safe from all distress,

13
00:02:30,555 --> 00:02:35,475
as we await the blessed hope and
the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.

14
00:02:35,595 --> 00:02:39,835
For the kingdom, the power and the glory
are yours, now and for ever.

15
00:02:39,955 --> 00:02:42,395
The peace of the Lord
be with you always.

16
00:02:42,515 --> 00:02:44,035
And with your spirit.

17
00:02:44,155 --> 00:02:48,495
In the spirit of Christ risen,
exchange a sign of peace.

18
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:51,895
Peace.

19
00:02:54,683 --> 00:02:57,223
Peace be with you.

20
00:03:00,075 --> 00:03:01,675
Peace.

21
00:04:04,595 --> 00:04:08,555
Good morning!
Good morning, Grandma!

22
00:04:08,675 --> 00:04:10,157
Everything all right?

23
00:04:10,178 --> 00:04:13,075
You grow more beautiful every day!
Cutie-pie.

24
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:14,595
Michelangelo!
- Aunty!

25
00:04:14,615 --> 00:04:17,535
I made pasta for you.
- Do you remember Patrizia?

26
00:04:17,755 --> 00:04:19,715
Of course!
- She's joining us today.

27
00:04:19,835 --> 00:04:21,475
I'll take care of it.

28
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,715
Michelangelo,
come with me to buy dessert.

29
00:04:23,835 --> 00:04:26,235
Wait, Ciccio.
- We'll be back in ten minutes.

30
00:04:26,355 --> 00:04:28,455
Wait!
- Come with me.

31
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:31,273
I'll be right back.

32
00:04:33,195 --> 00:04:35,555
Give them to me, I'll cut them.

33
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:39,295
Donna Patrizia, give me your jacket.

34
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:49,858
You don't know how to do it.

35
00:04:52,955 --> 00:04:55,875
I'll do it with mozzarella.

36
00:04:55,995 --> 00:05:00,084
Can I help?
- There's no need, thank you.

37
00:05:12,555 --> 00:05:15,475
Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

38
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:19,414
In church I saw
you didn't take part in the prayer.

39
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:22,499
Don't you have faith?

40
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:26,595
I lost both my parents
when I was only 12 years old.

41
00:05:26,842 --> 00:05:30,715
I was left with my three-year-old
brother and two younger sisters.

42
00:05:30,835 --> 00:05:34,615
From then on, for me
the Almighty has only been a fantasy.

43
00:05:35,595 --> 00:05:40,135
The Almighty tests our faith
through pain.

44
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:52,014
The priest who buried Mamma
said God is love.

45
00:05:52,915 --> 00:05:56,375
That's right, God is love.

46
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:54,275
Nicola.

47
00:06:56,307 --> 00:06:58,792
Where are we meeting?

48
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,295
Okay, got it, I'll come by later.

49
00:07:16,468 --> 00:07:18,632
Can I have a word?

50
00:07:25,906 --> 00:07:27,995
At your disposal.

51
00:07:29,355 --> 00:07:32,575
I raised my Michelangelo like a prince.

52
00:07:33,475 --> 00:07:37,875
I sent him to school,
he's educated.

53
00:07:37,995 --> 00:07:40,135
He speaks proper Italian.

54
00:07:41,035 --> 00:07:43,575
Michelangelo is special to me.

55
00:07:44,595 --> 00:07:48,179
He told us you're seeing
a lot of each other

56
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,815
and for matters
that don't concern our business.

57
00:07:53,435 --> 00:07:56,718
You're the boss of Secondigliano
and we respect you,

58
00:07:56,843 --> 00:08:01,515
basically because the person
who put you there is one of us.

59
00:08:01,687 --> 00:08:05,695
But we don't want our blood
mixing with yours.

60
00:08:10,395 --> 00:08:13,176
If you please...

61
00:08:13,297 --> 00:08:15,175
let's go eat.

62
00:10:50,828 --> 00:10:52,815
I want to say something.

63
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:56,995
If Patrizia is here,
there's a reason for it.

64
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,263
I want to tell you that she and I...
- What do you want to say?

65
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:03,923
What does he want to say?
What's going on, Mickey?

66
00:11:04,044 --> 00:11:07,794
Nothing, absolutely nothing's going on.

67
00:11:08,176 --> 00:11:10,708
Don't worry, Donna Benedetta.

68
00:11:10,856 --> 00:11:14,048
If I'm here today it's because
a new shipment has arrived.

69
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:17,755
If it's all right with you,
tonight we'll organize the delivery.

70
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:21,695
The sooner the better.
- Then that's settled.

71
00:11:22,575 --> 00:11:25,856
Thank you so much,
it was all delicious.

72
00:11:27,475 --> 00:11:29,606
But I have to go.

73
00:11:34,512 --> 00:11:36,629
Why?
- Because it's only right.

74
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,915
It's right for you, not for me!

75
00:11:40,155 --> 00:11:42,480
Mickey, wait a minute.

76
00:11:49,514 --> 00:11:51,495
Patrizia!

77
00:11:55,032 --> 00:11:57,626
Where are you going? Stop!

78
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,795
Stop! Get out.
- I haven't got time for this bullshit.

79
00:12:01,915 --> 00:12:06,126
Is it bullshit?
If it's bullshit run me down. Get out!

80
00:12:13,035 --> 00:12:16,275
I couldn't give a fuck
about what my family said.

81
00:12:16,395 --> 00:12:19,099
They're your blood.

82
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,815
No one can go against their own blood.

83
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:26,195
I learned that the hard way.

84
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:29,069
That's just the way it is, Michelangelo.

85
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:38,475
Guys, run! The cops!

86
00:14:38,595 --> 00:14:40,735
Tell the others!

87
00:14:47,235 --> 00:14:48,675
Lino!

88
00:14:48,795 --> 00:14:52,935
Nicola!
- Lino, run!

89
00:14:59,678 --> 00:15:02,536
The cops!
- Run!

90
00:15:02,657 --> 00:15:04,855
Get in!

91
00:15:08,022 --> 00:15:11,562
Stop, police!
- Against the wall!

92
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,494
Go!

93
00:15:29,824 --> 00:15:33,175
Don't move! Face on the ground!

94
00:16:18,326 --> 00:16:21,355
I don't know how it happened.

95
00:16:21,475 --> 00:16:24,395
The cops suddenly showed up.

96
00:16:24,642 --> 00:16:27,255
Right, Lino?
- That's right.

97
00:16:34,648 --> 00:16:37,995
The guys are trusted soldiers,

98
00:16:38,224 --> 00:16:41,335
they've worked with us
on every shipment.

99
00:16:43,953 --> 00:16:46,475
What do you think of me, Nicola?

100
00:16:51,715 --> 00:16:55,508
I've demonstrated what I think of you
with my actions.

101
00:16:57,545 --> 00:17:01,075
This raid is a fucking big problem

102
00:17:01,345 --> 00:17:04,131
and takes priority over everything.

103
00:17:07,034 --> 00:17:08,800
What do we do?

104
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:10,946
Call a meeting.

105
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:15,720
I want the whole Alliance there,
I wanna see if one of them's involved.

106
00:18:17,276 --> 00:18:19,416
Donna Patrizia...

107
00:18:21,355 --> 00:18:24,775
they ripped off the drugs
we paid for upfront?

108
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:29,156
The problem's not just the money
we paid upfront,

109
00:18:29,277 --> 00:18:32,002
if there's no drugs to sell...

110
00:18:33,228 --> 00:18:35,058
the dealing will stop.

111
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:37,495
The dealing won't stop.

112
00:18:38,915 --> 00:18:42,218
We'll sell hashish, pills.
- Pills?

113
00:18:42,897 --> 00:18:46,058
Are we 15?
- We all have to suffer.

114
00:18:46,305 --> 00:18:49,034
The time it takes for another shipment.

115
00:18:50,275 --> 00:18:52,584
So, tell me something.

116
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:58,881
Who's going to pay
for this new shipment?

117
00:19:01,715 --> 00:19:05,275
This Alliance is based
on the rules we all agreed to.

118
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,895
The shipment was my responsibility.

119
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,058
I'll pay for it.

120
00:19:12,232 --> 00:19:14,702
And how long will it take?

121
00:19:16,674 --> 00:19:19,595
A month.
- That seems too long.

122
00:19:19,793 --> 00:19:24,053
This raid was bad for all of us.

123
00:19:25,275 --> 00:19:27,634
For us the same as you.

124
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:33,495
But if you give us what we lost
we'll be square.

125
00:19:35,035 --> 00:19:37,295
But a month means a month.

126
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:44,418
You have my word.

127
00:19:45,923 --> 00:19:48,023
That's good enough for us.

128
00:19:51,489 --> 00:19:53,874
Good enough for us, too.

129
00:20:36,755 --> 00:20:38,515
You got a problem?

130
00:20:38,635 --> 00:20:42,075
Tell her we want
to talk to her, alone.

131
00:20:42,195 --> 00:20:44,015
All good.

132
00:21:04,395 --> 00:21:06,595
They're not happy?

133
00:21:06,715 --> 00:21:10,172
They want to talk to you
without people around.

134
00:21:10,293 --> 00:21:13,080
We gotta take 'em out straightaway.

135
00:21:15,683 --> 00:21:18,343
I'll decide what we do.

136
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,200
Good morning.

137
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,680
Hello, Donna Patrizia.
- Good morning.

138
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,020
Well? What do we need to talk about?

139
00:21:56,793 --> 00:21:58,760
What you said doesn't sit right with us.

140
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,120
Till yesterday
the Forcella guys were small fry.

141
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,640
The Levantes have a finger in every
fucking pie, government contracts...

142
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,600
Drugs are chump change for them.

143
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,080
But we live off drugs
and we can't afford to lose a month.

144
00:22:11,368 --> 00:22:13,759
We found another channel.

145
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,100
We all get coke through
the same channel, that's the deal.

146
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,440
Or am I wrong?

147
00:22:25,614 --> 00:22:29,594
You're not wrong
but our people are starving.

148
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:35,013
And if they turn on us there won't be
any more deals with anyone.

149
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,160
You understand...

150
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,240
I understand that you're being
disrespectful to me.

151
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,759
You can understand what you want,

152
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,742
but you have to give us our money now.

153
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,960
We'll wait until next Sunday.

154
00:22:49,115 --> 00:22:52,855
You have one week,
then we'll go through other channels.

155
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,390
That's it, then.

156
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,020
50 thousand.

157
00:24:44,581 --> 00:24:46,844
We're 500 thousand short.

158
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,140
Have we looked everywhere?
- There's nothing left.

159
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:04,204
Go away.

160
00:25:06,222 --> 00:25:08,460
I said go away!

161
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:52,106
You know what I'm doing
and what the drug money is for.

162
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,041
I put you in Secondigliano so
I didn't have to bother about this shit.

163
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,098
I don't know who,
but someone wants to screw me.

164
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,049
What did you expect?

165
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,027
This is what it means to be a boss.

166
00:27:20,445 --> 00:27:22,654
This is our life.

167
00:27:24,263 --> 00:27:26,760
Few friends and snakes everywhere.

168
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,655
The Capaccios can't wait
to break this alliance...

169
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:49,440
and I can't afford
any trouble right now.

170
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,858
We have to do what they want.

171
00:27:53,865 --> 00:27:58,144
I'll give you the money for
the shipment, but it's the last time.

172
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,248
Thank you, Gennaro.

173
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,260
Patrizia...

174
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,632
bring me the name of who did it.

175
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,720
What are you doing here?

176
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,520
Don Michelangelo Levante's inside,

177
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,344
he says he wants to talk to you.

178
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:25,579
What do you want?
- I heard you have a problem.

179
00:29:25,767 --> 00:29:29,640
I want to help you.
- I don't need it.

180
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:33,520
Go home, or your father will be worried.

181
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,861
Still on about my father?

182
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,920
You know what I think? The problem's
not the crap my father says.

183
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,080
What is it, then?
- You don't have any balls.

184
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,840
I'm tired, I can't even listen to you.
Let go of me.

185
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:55,597
I went against my whole family for you.
I'm still here.

186
00:29:55,718 --> 00:29:58,280
And what did you do?

187
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,454
You ran away.

188
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,620
You know what I think, how I feel.

189
00:30:06,968 --> 00:30:09,358
You know all too well.

190
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,240
But this is the last time I'm saying it.

191
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,253
If you want me, you make the next move.

192
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,520
Well?

193
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,160
Have you taken care of that matter?

194
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,983
Alberto, maybe I wasn't clear,
I need this money now.

195
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,820
And I mean now.

196
00:30:58,697 --> 00:31:01,620
Don't worry, we'll fix it all up later.

197
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,500
All right.

198
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,378
What's going on?

199
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,200
Nothing, baby, it's all good.

200
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,880
You said that in London, too.

201
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:34,800
It's always all good.

202
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:36,708
Gennaro...

203
00:31:36,832 --> 00:31:40,519
we made a promise, you and me...

204
00:31:40,731 --> 00:31:43,716
that we're always together in this.

205
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:57,073
It's better if I'm on my own for certain things. 
- Don't treat me like I'm dumb!

206
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,730
They fucked off with the shipment, okay?

207
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,040
And I have to fix it
or else the peace is gone.

208
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:21,000
And we can flush everything
we've done down the shitter!

209
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,560
Who told you? Patrizia?

210
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,000
Was it her calling you?
Why didn't you tell me, asshole?

211
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,520
What the fuck's that got to do with it?

212
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,670
I gotta help her and I gotta do it
for us, you know that!

213
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,700
I know.

214
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,300
But I'm with you.

215
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:46,220
And you mustn't hide
anything from me anymore.

216
00:34:06,771 --> 00:34:09,670
What you're looking for is in there.

217
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,917
But it's not a gift.

218
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,760
I know it's not a gift.

219
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,660
Tell Gennaro I'll give it back
in two months.

220
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,610
You used to work in a place like this,
didn't you?

221
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,480
Patrizia...

222
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,720
I wanted to tell you personally...

223
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,940
how far this collaboration is taking us.

224
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,608
That's very important.

225
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,786
Me and Gennaro still
have a lot of faith in you.

226
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:15,860
And I paid a heavy price to earn it.

227
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,774
That's true.

228
00:35:20,586 --> 00:35:23,470
You've done a lot for us.

229
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:26,018
And I won't forget it.

230
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,673
But don't think you're the only one
who's lost something.

231
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,220
Don't worry.

232
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,980
I won't forget it.

233
00:36:02,978 --> 00:36:04,991
You can go now.

234
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,640
Take it to them now.

235
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,520
Tell the Capaccios
they got what they asked for.

236
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,360
You want us to come with you?

237
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,978
No, I need to sort something out
on my own.

238
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,643
Donna Patrizia, good evening.

239
00:37:16,605 --> 00:37:20,442
To what do we owe the pleasure
of this unexpected visit?

240
00:37:21,374 --> 00:37:26,226
Care to come in? A drink perhaps?
- Don't bother, Papa.

241
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,640
I just want to say something.

242
00:37:35,592 --> 00:37:37,462
Go ahead.

243
00:37:38,486 --> 00:37:41,520
The other day you said something to me...

244
00:37:41,757 --> 00:37:44,437
and I didn't say anything back.

245
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,900
Maybe you think I ran away.

246
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,860
If you do, you're wrong.
What you said offended me.

247
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,179
And that's no good.

248
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:03,959
On the other hand, as you know...

249
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,000
the basis for respect is sincerity.

250
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,707
Or am I wrong?

251
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,324
You're not wrong.

252
00:38:15,136 --> 00:38:17,451
Then there's something
you need to know.

253
00:38:17,472 --> 00:38:21,460
The problem isn't whether or not
I'm right for your son.

254
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,780
We've already made our choice.

255
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,980
The problem is you.

256
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,361
We're serious about each other.

257
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,880
Is that all?

258
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,949
That's all.

259
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:55,470

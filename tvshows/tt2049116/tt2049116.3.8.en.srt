1
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,480
- Guys.
- Hey, Vocabulary.

2
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,960
Guys...

3
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,760
Here to inspect the sugar factory?

4
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,760
We adulterate it, only 25% is shit.

5
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,040
That's better than the rest.

6
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,800
Some people even put rat poison in it,
but we are purists.

7
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,960
- Only phenacetin.
- This is good stuff.

8
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,560
The market agrees with you.

9
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,000
- Do you hear that?
- We're working our asses off.

10
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,640
- We're done. Let's go, I'm starving.
- You always want to eat.

11
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,520
- Enzo, what's the matter?
- Nothing, we have to go.

12
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,160
- Come with me.
- Keep it up, guys.

13
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,160
- Carmela, how are you?
- Fine.

14
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,000
- Was the camera turned on?
- Yes, the police took the footage.

15
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,400
- Did you see who it was?
- No, I couldn't see his face.

16
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,920
The police said it was a warning.
It wasn't a big bomb.

17
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,080
- But the next time it's serious.
- What did you tell them?

18
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,520
If they do their job, like I do
every night, there will be no next time.

19
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,880
I'll see you later.

20
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,520
This bomb is from the Federation,
I'm sure of it.

21
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,600
But they can't think we're afraid now.

22
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,800
We can't stop now,
we almost have them.

23
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,760
We have to kill 'em
and roll 'em up in bags.

24
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,880
We have to hit them now,
it doesn't matter who.

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,680
We just need to kill one now.

26
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,120
- Speak to me, Ciro.
- I just got the news.

27
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,240
- I need to see you right away.
- Where?

28
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,360
- I'll meet you at the warehouse.
- Okay.

29
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,440
We are your brothers.

30
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,440
We're done here.

31
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,560
Come with me.

32
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,360
What did he say?

33
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,960
Nothing.

34
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,560
But I know him well.

35
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,080
In is heart, he's furious.

36
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,880
Then that bomb can work in our favor.

37
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,480
Are you sure?

38
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,920
If they go nuts at the Federation now,
they'll do a lot of damage.

39
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,000
Unless they crash into a tree
and the Federation stays intact.

40
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,720
I turned Enzo into a soldier...

41
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,800
but now he has to become a capo.

42
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,160
He has to learn
to think before he shoots.

43
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,200
Only then we can win this.

44
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,480
If you're 20 years old,
shooting is easier than thinking.

45
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,560
I know.

46
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,320
That's why I have to talk to him.

47
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,240
Alone.

48
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Translated by: NederSubs

49
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,080
Do you know why the Federation
planted that bomb?

50
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,200
They think we're nobody,
but that isn't true.

51
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,560
But they have to keep thinking that.
We must keep our nerve.

52
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,440
When we're done,
we're going to kill them.

53
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,800
Do you mean I shouldn't do anything?

54
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,760
You do as I say, when I say it.

55
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,080
First, you have to reorganize your men.

56
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,280
How do you mean?

57
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,880
It won't work if everyone thinks
they're the boss.

58
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,400
If you want to win the war,
there can only be one leader.

59
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,360
And that's you.

60
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,720
Let me ask you something.

61
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,720
Shoot.

62
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,760
What's in this for you?

63
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,960
- 20 percent, as always.
- That's not much.

64
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,400
If everything goes well, I'll get Forcella.
What are you doing this for?

65
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,320
I'm doing the only thing I'm good at.

66
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,040
But whatever I do,
the spirits won't leave me alone.

67
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,880
- Guys, we need to get ready.
- We'll destroy them.

68
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,880
Yes, we will.

69
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,880
- But it's not that straightforward.
- How do you mean?

70
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,960
I have a plan.

71
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,960
We must weaken the Federation first.

72
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,360
If you follow my lead,
we can wipe them away.

73
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,840
And then we're the boss
in our own neighborhood.

74
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,120
Sounds good, but I think
we no longer decide together.

75
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,320
You are the boss now, aren't you?

76
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,600
We're sailing towards the storm.

77
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,160
There is only one captain on the ship.

78
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,880
That was the case for the generation
before us. My dad died for it.

79
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,920
But we see things differently.

80
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,800
We don't let anyone tell us what to do.

81
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,520
To win the war,
we'll have to change things.

82
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,720
And when we change things, we'll win.
I promise.

83
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,160
So you are Enzo Blue Blood.

84
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,840
Do you have that name for me?

85
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,240
This is from Gennaro.

86
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,880
This is the contact, we already
talked to him. He's expecting your call.

87
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,400
But you have to give him something.

88
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,440
That's not a problem.

89
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,200
I still don't know your name.

90
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,200
Patrizia.

91
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,560
It was a pleasure, Patrì.

92
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,840
Leave it to me.

93
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,520
Good.

94
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,200
And?

95
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,760
- The kid showed up.
- Great.

96
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:18,600
Something else: tell Cianel
to spend all her cash on weapons.

97
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,200
Is this a joke?

98
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,280
Should I hypnotize her, or what?
She's not a part of your war.

99
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,520
Make it clear
she's either for or against me.

100
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,120
And what if she's against you?
What do I do?

101
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,120
Then you let her pay the price.

102
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,200
This is not acceptable, clear?
Or should I cram you in it?

103
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,760
And now get the hell out.

104
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,600
What a mistake to hire those losers.

105
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,680
They work hard
and they don't bother us...

106
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,760
but this is about decency.

107
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,680
How the hell can I bury someone
in a red-lined coffin?

108
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,840
It's a matter of respect.

109
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,320
What is it?

110
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,000
The war Genny wants to wage
with those people from downtown...

111
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,840
That's not a joke.

112
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,720
It's real, and he's going to start now.

113
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,880
What do you think of it?

114
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,800
They called us monkeys.

115
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,760
It's time to show them
nobody puts these monkeys in a cage.

116
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,320
They should wash out their mouths
with soap before they can talk to you.

117
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,360
Well said.

118
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,200
Come in.

119
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,920
This is a gift for you.

120
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,880
- Hello, Cocò.
- How are you, Catenella?

121
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,200
- Not bad, and you?
- Okay. I have some good stuff for you.

122
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,320
Good stuff, great class.

123
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,160
Your Myriam would love it.
And the price is really good.

124
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,720
If it's good and cheap stuff,
I can't refuse.

125
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,760
- Do I see you in half an hour?
- I never turn down a great deal...

126
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,160
but half an hour is too short.
I have to discuss with Myriam first.

127
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,240
They want money straightaway.

128
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,440
That's why the price is so reasonable.

129
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,000
Okay, I'm on my way.
I'll surprise Myriam with it.

130
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,440
Well done.

131
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,080
He's on his way.

132
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,240
Don't move.

133
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,800
Let me go.

134
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,880
Stand up.

135
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,200
Sit still, for fuck's sake.
Don't move.

136
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,960
Piece of shit.

137
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,560
We know you're buying weapons
for the Federation.

138
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,640
We want to know where you store them.

139
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,400
What are you doing?

140
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,160
You are puppies
challenging Neapolitan Mastiffs.

141
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,280
They'll tear you apart alive.

142
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,440
He's like an old washing machine:
hit it a few times and it works again.

143
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,800
We are not puppies, you are.

144
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,760
You have a boss.

145
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,920
Kill me.

146
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,520
Kill me, but I can't tell you.

147
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,040
- Ronni, everything alright?
- Certainly.

148
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,240
Look who's here.

149
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,640
I'm looking at his daughter Myriam.

150
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,200
She doesn't look like her father,
a real sweetie.

151
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,640
And that kid is also cute.
I'll show him to you.

152
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,040
Do you see that kid on that bike?
And that's his mother.

153
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,720
I wouldn't like to hurt her...

154
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,880
What do you think?

155
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,120
See? Puppies bite as well.

156
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,080
Please...

157
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,360
My family has nothing to do with this.

158
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,360
You can decide that yourself.

159
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,960
And? What should I tell my buddy?

160
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,920
What do I say to him?

161
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,440
There are three stashes.

162
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,560
The hotel near the train station...

163
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,640
the cemetery in Chiaiano...

164
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,720
and the flag factory in Via Marina.

165
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,480
Well done.

166
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,160
You did the right thing.

167
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,920
Are you coming along?

168
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,440
We know where the weapons are.

169
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,800
Good. Then we can start biting.

170
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,840
Are we going to screw over
that asshole Arenella right away?

171
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,880
Arenella is a real son of a bitch,
but he is cold-blooded.

172
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,520
We better go for Crazy.

173
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,920
He's stupid, and very short-tempered.

174
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,200
And the Capaccios have too few men
to defend their place.

175
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,160
We hit them at a place
where they can't hit us back right away.

176
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,320
Then we do real damage.

177
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,680
To bite hard, we need teeth.
And we're short of those.

178
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,360
You don't have to worry about that.

179
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,720
I have a present for you.

180
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,600
You made the right choice, Blue Blood.

181
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,400
There was no other choice.

182
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,880
Tell me, kiddo...

183
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,280
Can you handle these toys?

184
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,880
Don't you worry.
I will get you many customers.

185
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,040
Hopefully we aren't leaving these toys
in the hands of children.

186
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,360
Do you know why they call Ciro
the Immortal?

187
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,440
Because he survived three wars?

188
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,800
When he was 21 days old,
his parents died in an earthquake.

189
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,320
He was the only survivor
of the 30 residents.

190
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,160
If you think you are the earthquake
that will kill him, I'll find you.

191
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,960
Like yourself, I'm a son of a king...

192
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,760
but just like Ciro,
I grew up being an orphan.

193
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,600
We are sons of spirits,
our fathers were slaughtered,

194
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,360
and the Federation didn't even
give us back their bodies.

195
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,400
So you only want revenge?

196
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,880
I want what they took away from us
and what I deserve:

197
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,960
I want Forcella.

198
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,920
Then you'll get Forcella.

199
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,920
But if you get hungry afterwards...

200
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,600
I'll rip your heart out.

201
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:12,400
As far as I'm concerned, he's your
responsibility, because he chose you.

202
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,520
Everything that happens to him
should also happen to you. Clear?

203
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,360
Hurry up.

204
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,960
Lift it off.

205
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,120
And this one too.
Put it against the wall.

206
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,080
Dig in.

207
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,320
- Holy shit.
- Santa has come.

208
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,600
You know what to do.

209
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,880
- Have you ever had a weapon?
- No.

210
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,040
Take this one.

211
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,200
Who are you again?

212
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,280
The people who are letting you live.

213
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:50,280
- Get lost, this is not your terrain.
- You didn't understand.

214
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,600
You're a herding dog now
and I'm the shepherd.

215
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,800
Goodbye.

216
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,080
Guys, let's move on.

217
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,440
Alright. Bye.

218
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,600
Those beards took over
our parking lot and the Torri Bar.

219
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,880
We have to teach them a lesson.

220
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,800
- They must die.
- Wait.

221
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,760
Wait until
they've taken over everything?

222
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,400
Maybe they have a strategy.

223
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,720
- What do you mean?
- Why do you never think?

224
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,600
They've done this right under our noses.
So they're either really stupid...

225
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,480
or they're keeping us on a leash.

226
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:59,040
We are not dogs,
we're strong enough to destroy them.

227
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,560
Pick up the weapons.
I'll see you in an hour. Hurry up.

228
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,320
- What's taking them so long?
- No idea.

229
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,240
We've been here for two hours.

230
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,440
There they are.

231
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,000
Where are they going?

232
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,680
- Wait.
- Where did he go?

233
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,280
Now.

234
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,560
Close it.

235
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,760
We have them.

236
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,000
Come on, hurry up.

237
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,800
Hurry up.

238
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,200
Drive.

239
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,880
Quiet, don't move.

240
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,520
There's nobody here.

241
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,600
Are they dead?

242
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,880
What are you talking about? Come on.

243
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,040
Take this.

244
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,560
Stop dreaming, come with me.

245
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,520
Hand it to me.

246
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,960
They have all weapons
and almost all lives.

247
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,520
We have to call the Slave for weapons.

248
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,440
And new men, Romeo must help us.

249
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,520
He also benefits from this.

250
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,240
They'll go after him as well.

251
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,520
We'll give 5000 euros
to everyone who joins us.

252
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,800
We form an army, cut off their dicks
and cram them in their mouths.

253
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,240
That requires more than just an army.

254
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,400
Don't you see what happened?

255
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,640
We had more people and weapons
and it still happened.

256
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,320
What should we do then,
according to you?

257
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,560
We let them believe that they have won,
that they're stronger.

258
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,040
That we're shitting ourselves
and don't fight back.

259
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,520
We wait a few hours so they'll relax...

260
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,680
and then we'll send them to God
to ask for forgiveness.

261
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,200
What's going on? Where is Enzo?

262
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,120
Don't worry, Enzo knows what he's doing.

263
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,040
- Everything okay?
- It's suspiciously quiet.

264
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,560
What do we do now?

265
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,960
We go home,
but first we send a message.

266
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,480
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

267
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,800
- Maria saw strangers in our neighborhood.
- What do we do?

268
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,720
Go and see, Valerio.

269
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,920
You wanted to see me?

270
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,800
I heard your boys have been busy.

271
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,160
- What do you think?
- You know what you're doing.

272
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,520
You gave me this business
and I work hard.

273
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,320
If you join me,
this is only the beginning.

274
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,640
- But now I need something else from you.
- What?

275
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,600
30 percent of your revenue.

276
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,120
I need it to win this war.

277
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,960
I'll make sure you'll get back
three times the amount.

278
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,360
Do you see this coffin?

279
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,040
Nice, huh? I keep him for myself.

280
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,040
But I only go in when I'm very old.

281
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:06,320
Whatever you want. But in the meantime,
we scored big points with the angels.

282
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,080
What do you mean?

283
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,040
You want the Capaccio's place?

284
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,520
After this war, it's yours.

285
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,120
We'll build a beautiful statue there.

286
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,240
Do you know what they say?

287
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,000
The biggest whore

288
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:27,840
is the one who gives you lice
and then fucks you again.

289
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,360
You do that too.

290
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,880
Excuse me, I'm lost.
How do I get to Via Foria?

291
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,240
Fuck off back to Vomero.

292
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,640
Sorry.

293
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,520
What are you doing?
You said you'd only look.

294
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,760
You take this.
Come on, we have to go.

295
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,400
Put this on.

296
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,600
Hurry up.

297
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,320
Go on.

298
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,880
Done?

299
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,480
We have to split up.

300
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,040
Go home.

301
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,640
- Everything okay?
- Everything okay.

302
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,880
- Go to bed.
- Take care.

303
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,280
Bye, sweetie.

304
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,120
- How are you?
- I'm still alive. What's up?

305
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,640
Maria told me who your new friend
from Secondigliano is.

306
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,440
Where are you going?

307
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,040
Look at me.

308
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,080
Was that friend with you tonight?

309
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,000
- Was he with you?
- No.

310
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,640
Why not?

311
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,400
He supplies the weapons and the drugs.

312
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,520
Thanks to him,
those assholes are now afraid.

313
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,320
I get it.

314
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,000
He is the choreographer and you dance.

315
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,400
If something goes wrong,
they'll come for you.

316
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,440
That's not how it went.

317
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,200
And if we win this war, then what?

318
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:55,160
Does he get paid for the choreography,
or does he buy the whole theater?

319
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,840
He's my brother.

320
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,840
I'll tell you what I told everyone:

321
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,200
If you're not for me, you're against me.

322
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,640
I've heard about your exam.

323
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,840
Valerio, you can do whatever you want...

324
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,240
but you have to get your diploma.

325
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,160
- What do we do?
- Inform the families, we'll go on tomorrow.

326
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,560
They are the devil.

327
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,360
What are you laughing at?

328
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,800
They're destroying us,
what's so funny about that?

329
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,320
Yes, laugh.

330
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,000
They're stone cold.

331
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,440
We can do two things:

332
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,120
We can exterminate them,
or we can invite them over.

333
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,960
Either way, it will be fun.

334
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,200
NEXT TIME

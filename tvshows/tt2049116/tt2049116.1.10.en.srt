Near my spirit with your wisdom
and my arms with your will.

3
00:00:43,986 --> 00:00:49,786
Give me keen eye and sure step
the Fatherland's sacred mountain.

4
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:56,546
When the future soldier marching
as, a knock faithful heart.

5
00:00:57,026 --> 00:01:00,786
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with you.

6
00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:05,626
Blessed are you among women,
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

7
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:11,546
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
Pray for us sinners.

8
00:01:11,626 --> 00:01:15,066
Now and in the hour of our death. Amen.

9
00:01:48,426 --> 00:01:50,626
Run.

10
00:01:59,106 --> 00:02:02,826
Play some music.

11
00:03:14,786 --> 00:03:20,146
<i>First believed it was
to avenge the murder of Tonino Russo-</i>

12
00:03:20,226 --> 00:03:25,346
<i>- but then it was discovered,
the charred corpse in the car</i>

13
00:03:25,426 --> 00:03:29,706
<i>was a very young girl.</i>

14
00:03:29,786 --> 00:03:35,106
<i>The victim has not been identified yet.
The only clue</i>

15
00:03:35,186 --> 00:03:41,026
<i>is a diamond ring,
which was found inside the car.</i>

16
00:03:41,106 --> 00:03:45,586
<i>Police are investigating
whether there is a link</i>

17
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:49,346
<i>between the murder of Russo and the girl.</i>

18
00:03:49,426 --> 00:03:56,066
<i>One thing is certain: the Camorra follows
no longer a code of honor.</i>

19
00:03:56,146 --> 00:04:00,186
<i>Anyone can be a victim for their bloodshed.</i>

20
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:08,946
Who was that?
- I do not know.

21
00:04:09,026 --> 00:04:12,906
Look me in the eyes.

22
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:18,506
You know nothing about Russo or girl?

23
00:04:21,226 --> 00:04:25,506
And your boys?
- I do not know, I said.

24
00:04:27,026 --> 00:04:30,546
Then you must prove it to them.

25
00:04:30,626 --> 00:04:35,986
Salvatore Conte will not ignore
a murder of one of its own.

26
00:04:48,546 --> 00:04:52,346
Wait, I'll be here shortly.

27
00:05:01,706 --> 00:05:05,426
Fill the tank, please.

28
00:05:10,906 --> 00:05:15,746
Mother. I took it before,
because I was at work.

29
00:05:15,826 --> 00:05:19,346
Have Daniele given sound?

30
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:23,946
Today? Are you sure?

31
00:05:24,026 --> 00:05:29,666
He did not come home last night.
This morning phoned his girlfriend's father.

32
00:05:31,346 --> 00:05:37,426
He's not a child anymore.
You may soon grandmother.

33
00:05:38,746 --> 00:05:41,946
Please, Massimo. Call me.

34
00:05:42,026 --> 00:05:46,066
Do not worry.
Now I work.

35
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:49,946
Hey.
Hey.

36
00:06:20,066 --> 00:06:22,546
Good day.

37
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:27,786
What is he doing here?

38
00:06:32,786 --> 00:06:37,146
Hello, ladies.
Can I talk to you?

39
00:06:53,866 --> 00:06:58,146
I'm sorry, what happened to Tonino.

40
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:09,546
It's as if someone from
my own family have been killed.

41
00:07:35,946 --> 00:07:43,346
Is that like a real cigarette?
- It tastes like dirt and cinnamon.

42
00:07:43,426 --> 00:07:46,826
But it's healthier.

43
00:07:46,906 --> 00:07:51,066
I'll shit on health.

44
00:07:52,626 --> 00:07:55,306
Why did you then quit smoking?

45
00:07:55,386 --> 00:07:59,906
Every year I stop with something I like.

46
00:08:01,626 --> 00:08:03,786
Why?

47
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:08,986
He is not dependent
of something that is never afraid.

48
00:08:19,986 --> 00:08:23,786
We must find out who killed Russo.

49
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:28,826
- They also found a charred girl.
Yes, we need to find out everything.

50
00:08:28,906 --> 00:08:34,106
Everyone should know that we do not
had something to do with the murders.

51
00:08:34,626 --> 00:08:40,386
I told his wife, but she did not believe me.

52
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:44,506
And Salvatore Conte is on the way back.

53
00:08:44,586 --> 00:08:49,986
We could lose everything, do you understand that?

54
00:09:07,706 --> 00:09:10,786
So what?

55
00:09:12,306 --> 00:09:16,106
I will not give a shit.

56
00:09:16,626 --> 00:09:22,186
It does not matter,
Gennaro was the home of Tonino.

57
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:28,986
I want to know how things
itself, not what Savastano did.

58
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:39,586
My friend and a girl have been
killed, and nobody knows anything.

59
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:43,026
Also a girl?

60
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:49,386
Do you think it was Savastano?

61
00:09:49,986 --> 00:09:55,426
Those in Naples are idiots,
who can not find their own dick.

62
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:04,586
I have not found him.

63
00:10:07,226 --> 00:10:13,306
Pressure his friend Bruno.
But not too much.

64
00:10:13,386 --> 00:10:19,666
No-nonsense. As with the ring.
- I understand.

65
00:10:19,746 --> 00:10:23,786
We must find him Rosא.

66
00:10:23,866 --> 00:10:30,226
Otherwise, we're done.
Do you hear? Go now.

67
00:11:07,226 --> 00:11:10,786
Do not take the damn phone?

68
00:11:10,866 --> 00:11:15,386
Sorry, it's not important.

69
00:11:21,946 --> 00:11:27,106
I work. I can not talk now.
- Wait. Do not hang up.

70
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,786
I work.
- Do not get mad.

71
00:11:30,866 --> 00:11:35,746
You do not understand.
I fucked up.

72
00:11:35,826 --> 00:11:39,986
I can not talk now.
Call mom. She is worried.

73
00:11:41,226 --> 00:11:44,666
I can not call to mother or anyone else.

74
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:52,226
I'll call you when I can.

75
00:12:00,106 --> 00:12:03,506
It was my brother.

76
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:17,386
How was the Greek gold crash?
- Good.

77
00:12:17,466 --> 00:12:22,706
Why float the animal completely
Greece to no avail?

78
00:12:22,786 --> 00:12:26,386
Go ahead, signora. See you soon.

79
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:31,386
Can I help?
- Do you know Daniele?

80
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:36,026
Yes.
- Do you know where he is?

81
00:12:37,346 --> 00:12:41,906
I'm talking to you.
- Move.

82
00:12:45,906 --> 00:12:50,986
- Have you heard from him?
Yes, a few days ago.

83
00:12:51,066 --> 00:12:56,986
He asked me for a favor, but I
were busy. We is not seen as often now.

84
00:12:57,066 --> 00:13:03,146
Okay. If he makes a sound, you can
say that Ciro looking for him.

85
00:13:03,226 --> 00:13:06,426
Otherwise, it can get ugly.

86
00:13:06,506 --> 00:13:13,666
If he contacts me, I say
it. But we have seen no more.

87
00:13:13,746 --> 00:13:18,426
Relax.

88
00:13:40,746 --> 00:13:44,386
Let me know when you want to stop.

89
00:13:44,466 --> 00:13:49,826
- Would you call your brother?
No, it was your fault.

90
00:13:49,906 --> 00:13:53,586
If you are hungry or thirsty.

91
00:13:56,586 --> 00:14:00,226
I'm hungry.

92
00:14:04,826 --> 00:14:08,146
Turn off here.

93
00:14:21,306 --> 00:14:27,826
Medium height, dark hair and light eyes.

94
00:14:27,906 --> 00:14:31,386
Quite normal.

95
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:53,826
What the hell happened?
- The jeweler has recognized the girl's ring.

96
00:14:53,906 --> 00:14:59,586
I should kill you.
- Ditto. Now all it was Daniele.

97
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:04,986
Get out.
- What do we do?

98
00:15:17,346 --> 00:15:20,866
Fan... Police.

99
00:15:20,946 --> 00:15:23,986
What do we do now?

100
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:27,866
Do not worry. I am Antonio Capano.

101
00:15:27,946 --> 00:15:34,466
I own a restaurant in Barcelona.
Do not do anything stupid, so it goes.

102
00:15:49,826 --> 00:15:53,426
Hey, Ciro.
- Hey, guys.

103
00:15:53,506 --> 00:15:57,306
We need to talk.
- Wait here.

104
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:09,986
It's one of ours, who made it.

105
00:16:10,706 --> 00:16:13,586
What do you mean?

106
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:18,186
You know him from the disco.
Daniele.

107
00:16:18,266 --> 00:16:23,146
He worked
for the mechanic and a little for me.

108
00:16:23,226 --> 00:16:28,546
- How do you know?
The girl in the car was his girlfriend.

109
00:16:28,626 --> 00:16:34,906
The girl with the ring. I am looking for him
but have not found him.

110
00:16:34,986 --> 00:16:38,706
There is a connection
between the girl and Tonino Russo.

111
00:16:38,786 --> 00:16:45,546
Listen. He came here,
he worked for you. Find him.

112
00:16:45,626 --> 00:16:49,986
I find him.
- Bring him to me, and understand it.

113
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:56,586
If Daniele did it, it
as if we are inside of it.

114
00:17:04,626 --> 00:17:08,666
- You all right?
The car is a black SUV.

115
00:17:11,026 --> 00:17:14,586
I'm sorry, but we did not run too fast.

116
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:18,306
I do not know what the problem is.
- Sorry.

117
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:23,426
Papers votes.
- I do not understand.

118
00:17:23,506 --> 00:17:27,666
What's the problem?
- Nothing.

119
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:32,146
You look like otherwise a thief.

120
00:17:32,226 --> 00:17:35,946
Yes? Okay.

121
00:17:36,026 --> 00:17:42,146
Monsieur. Your ID.
I can run, that's fine.

122
00:17:56,586 --> 00:18:01,346
- Have you decided you?
Two-frying.

123
00:18:03,306 --> 00:18:06,866
Excuse me a moment.

124
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:02,786
Massimo.
- What the hell happened?

125
00:19:08,626 --> 00:19:12,346
Where are you? Did you call Mom?

126
00:19:15,106 --> 00:19:18,186
Say something.

127
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:22,386
It was me.
- What have you done?

128
00:19:22,466 --> 00:19:28,906
They gave me orders.
I did not know who it was.

129
00:19:30,026 --> 00:19:33,266
He was a zero, they said.

130
00:19:35,186 --> 00:19:41,866
What are you saying?
- It was I who killed Russo.

131
00:20:00,946 --> 00:20:03,026
I did not know.

132
00:20:52,386 --> 00:20:56,426
Are you okay?
- Yes.

133
00:21:00,706 --> 00:21:05,826
Are you sure?
- Yes, but I'm very hungry.

134
00:21:30,346 --> 00:21:33,186
Good evening, signora.

135
00:21:34,266 --> 00:21:37,066
Good evening.

136
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:41,506
Sorry, I did not scare you.

137
00:21:41,586 --> 00:21:45,906
- Are you Daniele's mother?
Why joke about it?

138
00:21:45,986 --> 00:21:50,866
We are friends and I'm worried about him.

139
00:21:50,946 --> 00:21:54,946
Daniele did not come home yesterday, right?

140
00:21:58,306 --> 00:22:03,386
You are right.
I come here unannounced.

141
00:22:03,466 --> 00:22:10,186
But I am afraid that Daniele is
in trouble. I can help him.

142
00:22:10,266 --> 00:22:16,146
How do you know him?
- He made my motorcycle.

143
00:22:16,226 --> 00:22:20,466
He is very skilled with his hands.

144
00:22:20,546 --> 00:22:24,306
I like him.

145
00:22:24,946 --> 00:22:29,306
Wait. The lights are not enough.

146
00:22:31,186 --> 00:22:34,626
What trouble?

147
00:22:36,346 --> 00:22:41,106
I do not know.
I dare not say anything about.

148
00:22:43,106 --> 00:22:47,026
But I must find him.

149
00:22:47,106 --> 00:22:50,866
If I find him, he comes home.

150
00:22:50,946 --> 00:22:54,466
Otherwise I do not know how it ends.

151
00:22:54,546 --> 00:22:59,386
But I do not know where he is.
He has not called.

152
00:23:01,986 --> 00:23:07,986
I have a daughter, so I know how you feel.

153
00:23:08,066 --> 00:23:11,586
I will help.

154
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:16,706
But maybe I am exaggerating.
Let's do this.

155
00:23:16,786 --> 00:23:20,186
This is my phone number.

156
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:24,586
Call me if you hear from him or see him.

157
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:28,466
Okay?

158
00:23:31,586 --> 00:23:34,426
Good evening.

159
00:24:55,666 --> 00:25:01,306
Good evening, may I help you?
- A suite for one night.

160
00:25:02,746 --> 00:25:09,346
It's free. I have to ask for
ID and signature.

161
00:25:10,546 --> 00:25:13,026
Thank you.

162
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:20,826
Room 420 on the fourth floor.
I go up there. Good night.

163
00:25:30,346 --> 00:25:34,146
Wake me at. 5

164
00:25:41,906 --> 00:25:45,306
Take a coffee with.

165
00:26:43,866 --> 00:26:48,346
Good evening.
- Good evening. A cup of coffee, please.

166
00:27:30,746 --> 00:27:34,826
Can I take it?
- Yes.

167
00:28:17,386 --> 00:28:20,306
I could not call before.

168
00:28:20,386 --> 00:28:23,946
What do I do?
Tell me what to do.

169
00:28:24,026 --> 00:28:28,666
Do you know who I work for?
For Conte.

170
00:28:28,746 --> 00:28:32,386
We are moving now. He will know.

171
00:28:32,466 --> 00:28:36,226
But I did not know who it was.

172
00:28:41,466 --> 00:28:45,186
They killed Manu.

173
00:28:46,986 --> 00:28:50,906
They burned her, and it's my fault.

174
00:28:54,186 --> 00:28:59,946
Now they will also kill me.
- Shut up, Daniele. Shut.

175
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:29,826
<i>July 14, 1789 in Paris</i>

176
00:29:29,906 --> 00:29:34,466
<i>Bastille was stormed:
Revolution peak.</i>

177
00:29:34,546 --> 00:29:38,946
<i>July 14, 2013 is the Gran Fondo Pinarello.</i>

178
00:29:39,026 --> 00:29:43,426
<i>The stage is Montello,
as is known from the First World War.</i>

179
00:32:17,346 --> 00:32:22,306
What the hell are you doing? What are you doing?

180
00:32:22,986 --> 00:32:26,746
I know who killed Russo.

181
00:32:50,946 --> 00:32:57,946
He's just a kid.
They told him he was a zero.

182
00:32:58,026 --> 00:33:04,186
- They kill him. His girlfriend is dead.
And you would kill me?

183
00:33:06,106 --> 00:33:10,906
Where is your brother?
- I do not know.

184
00:33:10,986 --> 00:33:15,266
I should kill you.
Your brother is lucky-

185
00:33:15,346 --> 00:33:21,986
- if I find him before Savastano.
Your brother is proof of your deception.

186
00:33:25,826 --> 00:33:29,986
I'm the only one who can save him.

187
00:33:53,386 --> 00:33:56,546
- Hello?
Hey, Daniele.

188
00:33:58,986 --> 00:34:03,626
Where are you?
- There, father worked. Do you remember that?

189
00:34:03,706 --> 00:34:08,586
We were here when we were little.
- Yes, I remember.

190
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:12,026
Look, I've done it.

191
00:34:12,106 --> 00:34:18,786
I have talked to don Salvatore.
But you have to tell everything. Okay?

192
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:23,586
- Really?
Yes, I told her everything.

193
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:29,106
He understands that you were mixed into it,
and that it is not your fault.

194
00:34:31,186 --> 00:34:34,466
Stay where you are now.

195
00:34:35,266 --> 00:34:40,186
Are you sure, Massimo?
- Yes. We sit in the car.

196
00:34:40,266 --> 00:34:44,666
We'll be there in five to six hours.
Stay where you are.

197
00:34:44,746 --> 00:34:49,426
Are you coming?
- Yes. Hey.

198
00:34:53,546 --> 00:34:56,866
Now it's over.

199
00:34:57,986 --> 00:35:01,386
Do not worry.

200
00:35:42,026 --> 00:35:45,746
Salvatore Conte is on the way back.

201
00:35:52,746 --> 00:35:56,186
So we must prepare.

202
00:36:02,186 --> 00:36:07,626
It looks as though it was us who did it.

203
00:36:07,706 --> 00:36:12,666
If we're going to war,
is this the right occasion.

204
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:44,986
Tonight retrieve your mom
and brother and go to Spain.

205
00:36:45,066 --> 00:36:49,346
I'll find a job for you.
Something quietly.

206
00:36:51,226 --> 00:36:57,386
You can not be here. Not until I
has solved the problem of Savastano.

207
00:37:26,386 --> 00:37:30,266
Is that him?
- Yes.

208
00:37:30,346 --> 00:37:35,226
Don Salvatore.
I would not kill you.

209
00:37:35,306 --> 00:37:40,466
I was beside myself.
I have never wished you any harm.

210
00:37:40,546 --> 00:37:44,466
Thank you, Don Salvatore.

211
00:37:44,546 --> 00:37:49,026
Thank God that you are sitting in my car.

212
00:37:50,346 --> 00:37:54,026
No, wait here.

213
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:15,226
I am Salvatore Conte.
Do not worry, nothing happens.

214
00:38:17,266 --> 00:38:20,266
Nothing happens.

215
00:38:25,226 --> 00:38:31,946
It was not your fault. You got
orders and did not know who it was.

216
00:38:32,026 --> 00:38:35,506
Your brother has told everything.

217
00:38:45,426 --> 00:38:50,506
I just want to know one thing. Who
ordered you to kill Russo?

218
00:38:52,626 --> 00:38:55,506
Genny?

219
00:38:58,826 --> 00:39:02,266
Who was it, then?

220
00:39:02,346 --> 00:39:06,986
It was Ciro. Ciro di Marzio.

221
00:39:15,826 --> 00:39:18,746
I understand.

222
00:39:25,506 --> 00:39:30,386
Come here. Come here.
I forgive you.

223
00:39:38,706 --> 00:39:43,666
It'll be all right, little buddy.
Now it's over.

224
00:39:46,066 --> 00:39:49,466
It'll be fine.

225
00:39:52,386 --> 00:39:54,266
No.

226
00:40:54,266 --> 00:40:58,266

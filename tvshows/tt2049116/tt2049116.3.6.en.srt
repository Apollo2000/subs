1
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,520
Don't be so modest.

2
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,560
You're like Moses who splits the Red Sea
to let me in.

3
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,120
And now we're business partners.

4
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,400
Shall I tell you something,
Don Savastano?

5
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,720
You can call me Gennaro.

6
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,680
I like the sea a lot.

7
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,960
I have a 20 meter yacht
that I love more than my family.

8
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,080
If you're in distress at sea,
you call for help...

9
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,240
and then your savior is not an asshole.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,360
You can't wish for a better friend.

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,480
We're going to do great things together.

13
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,560
Did the boys make a fuss?

14
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,440
I explained that it's very profitable
to make sacrifices.

15
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,640
They really listen to you.

16
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,640
Because I kept all my promises so far.

17
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,480
Branka.

18
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,600
- Are you working with the Chinese now?
- It's good for them, and for me.

19
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,400
- Ciro.
- Your partner?

20
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,480
He's my brother.

21
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,480
Go with him.

22
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,560
BUSINESS DISTRICT, NAPLES

23
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,480
- Gennaro.
- How are you, Michele?

24
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,080
How nice to see you.

25
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,560
I knew you had it in you.

26
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,840
Without you,
nobody would've ever found out.

27
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,520
Do you want coffee?
Let's go to my office.

28
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,720
Can you bring us two coffee?

29
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,080
Damn, quite an office.

30
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,320
Well, I'm doing my best.

31
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,960
Tell me, what are you doing here?

32
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,240
I have 50 jobs for you.

33
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,920
I have a new friend, Gaetano Sanni.

34
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,160
From the laundry?

35
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,120
We've become partners.

36
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,560
He's given me a list of entrepreneurs
who are deeply in debt.

37
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,800
- Do you know what that means?
- No?

38
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,160
That I can now buy
a whole bunch of companies.

39
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,440
And you can get a lot of people a job.

40
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,640
And I'm guessing behind every job
is a family that's going to vote for me?

41
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,680
If you pass on municipal contracts
to my people...

42
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,720
I'll make sure
you become regional president.

43
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,400
Talk to everyone, then.
Tell them there's even too much work.

44
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,440
There is never too much work.

45
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,200
Thanks, Gennaro.

46
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,920
Take care.

47
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,840
The new polls are in.

48
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,040
Here it is.

49
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,480
Come with me.

50
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,520
- Excuse me?
- Come on in.

51
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,840
- Do you have the money?
- Yes.

52
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,680
It's almost 15,000, except for 200.
My father gave me everything he had.

53
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,480
We asked everyone,
but it wasn't enough.

54
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,120
- We're not that strict.
- Thanks.

55
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,840
Who's the job for?

56
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,880
For my husband, Lucio Calori.

57
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,760
He can't speak for himself?

58
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,400
She already thanked you,
what more do you want?

59
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:08,520
Don't mind him, he is upset.
We buried his mother yesterday.

60
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,040
- Do you even want that job?
- He really does.

61
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,080
I'm talking to him.

62
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,920
What will it be?

63
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,040
- Do you want to work or not?
- Yes.

64
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,560
Yes? Yes, thank you.

65
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,160
Yes, thank you.

66
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,640
Have a nice day.

67
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,520
How are you?

68
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,120
- Come in, Nicola.
- Hello.

69
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,320
The house is looking great.

70
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:29,320
- How many people were there today?
- We got 32 people a job.

71
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,280
- 480,000 euros?
- It's in here.

72
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,280
- Great.
- Bye, Gennaro.

73
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,240
- Hey, Gaetano.
- Hey, Gennaro.

74
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,520
This is the list you asked for.

75
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,120
How the hell
can a funeral home be in debt?

76
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,040
One can stop eating, not dying.

77
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,880
Dead people
don't gamble away their home.

78
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,720
- They want your money.
- How do you know that?

79
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,760
I know the bank manager well.

80
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,800
I promised him money for information
on people who want to borrow money.

81
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,480
Was that stupid of me?

82
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,720
No, that was a smart move.

83
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,440
Good morning, you wanted to see me?

84
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,680
From now on, only approved funeral homes
can come to here.

85
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,600
Is that a joke?

86
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,680
My family never makes jokes.

87
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,440
Here, this is the first one.

88
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,080
Make sure it is not your last one.

89
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,040
Do you know what to do?

90
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,520
If anyone asks for God's forgiveness,
I'll call you.

91
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,920
Amen.

92
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,760
Hello, Patrizia.

93
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,520
How are you, Gennaro?

94
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,960
Fine, I'm recovering.

95
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,480
Thanks for stopping by.

96
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,800
We had a deal, you and me.

97
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,040
From the beginning.

98
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,080
I'm keeping that deal.

99
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,040
Come with me,
I want to show you something.

100
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,800
This company used to deliver
meals to school cafeterias...

101
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,880
and then they ruined it
by serving dirty food and rotten meat.

102
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,720
Children became ill
and then the place was closed.

103
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,720
But tomorrow it will reopen
with a new name and cheap labor.

104
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,160
Who owns this place?

105
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,040
It's mine. I bought it from a friend.
What do you think?

106
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,560
Why is that important?

107
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,080
Because this place is yours now.

108
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,120
Who do we work for?

109
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,640
Michele Casillo, the mayor.

110
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,840
He gave us the contract
for the primary schools...

111
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,720
but when we make him
regional president...

112
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,240
we'll get all the hospitals and schools
in the area.

113
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,120
Are you interested?

114
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,380
Patrizia, where were you?

115
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:02,180
Gennaro called, I saw him.

116
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,540
She never tells me anything.

117
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,220
We'll smoke outside.

118
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,220
What does our little Gennarino want?

119
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,460
- He wants to offer you a proposal.
- Is that so?

120
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,140
What is it about?

121
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:50,060
He says things are going well,
he has a new drugs supplier.

122
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:54,740
He wants you in, because
four hands are always better than two.

123
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:59,220
Gennaro is history.
He's as poor as a church mouse.

124
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,140
And now he comes crying to mommy?

125
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,620
As far as I could tell,
he got back on its feet.

126
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,340
You don't see shit under water.

127
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,980
I'll do what you say.

128
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,060
But I'd think twice about it...

129
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,060
because there's no money left
in Secondigliano.

130
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,900
That stuff from the Albanians is shit.

131
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,420
And when you're broke,
your best friends will turn into enemies.

132
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,420
Do you know what changed?

133
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:45,380
Mom had a child and she lost it.
And she doesn't want children anymore.

134
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,340
Stop here.

135
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,820
Excuse me,
can I have the key to the gate?

136
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,900
There was never a lock on that.

137
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:09,180
- Probably a relative's.
- I'll ask.

138
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:15,300
- Mom, do you have the key?
- No. There was never a lock on it.

139
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,540
- What happens now?
- Calm down.

140
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:24,300
We'll talk to the manager.
Are you coming with me?

141
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,340
I'll be right back.

142
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,100
Put the coffin down for now.

143
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,500
Excuse me, could you come with me?

144
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,700
- What is it?
- Good morning.

145
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,860
Armando Maccaluso,
this is the death certificate.

146
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,620
- The family mausoleum is locked.
- Sorry, but it's full.

147
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,060
How is that possible?
That's our family mausoleum.

148
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,620
Remove that chain immediately.

149
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:15,060
The mausoleum is yours,
but you chose the wrong funeral home.

150
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:19,900
- Do you want me to call the police?
- Sure, go ahead.

151
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:24,580
How many free spots are there
in your mausoleum? Four?

152
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,500
If you call the police,
they will be filled in no time.

153
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,980
And?

154
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,500
She says she doesn't want to see you.

155
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,900
She doesn't care about your business.

156
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:05,740
Do you know why I asked you
to stay close to Cianel?

157
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:10,020
She is the only one in Secondigliano
who has men and weapons.

158
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,020
That's why you have to convince her.

159
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,620
How do you convince a snake?

160
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,860
With a gift.

161
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,100
If she says yes, she gets a mega gift.

162
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,420
- Thanks for coming right away.
- What happened?

163
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,100
I hired those people, as you said.

164
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,220
- Is someone making trouble?
- No, on the contrary.

165
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:21,620
They work very hard.
But I can't pay them.

166
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,620
- How so?
- The State is behind on their payments.

167
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:30,300
I used all the money to keep
the banks happy and now I'm broke.

168
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,780
That's the problem?

169
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:38,460
Pay who you can and explain it to the rest.
This is the State's fault, not ours.

170
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,780
And if someone makes a fuss?

171
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:49,260
Then you send them to me,
and I'll explain it one more time.

172
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,460
Lucio Calori.

173
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,580
Sign here.

174
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,780
Thanks.

175
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,620
- What's this?
- Something wrong?

176
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,500
I'm talking to the person who hired me.

177
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,140
Do you have a problem?

178
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:08,060
The monthly salary was 1150 euros,
this is only 850. Why is that?

179
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:12,220
- The rest is taxes.
- Taxes?

180
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,860
What taxes?
We don't have an employment contract...

181
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,940
or social security.
We're paid off the books, we don't exist.

182
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:23,500
If the government gave you work,
you had to pay taxes.

183
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:27,100
We gave you this job,
and you pay us nothing?

184
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:32,140
- I already paid for this job.
- Think before you start screaming.

185
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,940
- I paid 15,000 for this job.
- 14,800.

186
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:40,020
And for that 14,800 euros
we gave you a huge gift.

187
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,900
You're old,
no one hires you at your age.

188
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:51,340
At my age, I kick the shit
out of little assholes like you.

189
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,260
This is not over yet.
And don't laugh, you idiot.

190
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,020
Next.

191
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:10,620
- Cianel said yes, she's coming tomorrow.
- Great.

192
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:16,620
Our stuff sells very well,
at parties and in clubs.

193
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,300
Better than if we would sell it
on the streets.

194
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,260
The federation didn't notice anything?

195
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,140
Not yet, but that's a matter of time.

196
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,860
We sold 100 kilos within a month,
in their territory.

197
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,700
We must prepare for a war.

198
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:45,940
- I don't know if your boys are ready.
- You already saw what they can do.

199
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,060
Selling drugs is a breeze.

200
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,540
But they only know war from video games.

201
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,300
You were like that, right?

202
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,620
But then you learned it.

203
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:04,580
I had the best teacher,
who never felt sorry for me.

204
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,260
What are you thinking?

205
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:26,140
There is someone who wants to
put his nose into our business.

206
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,140
Blue Blood has to do it.

207
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:40,460
He has to do it. We can't handle it alone
when all hell breaks loose.

208
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,620
- Good evening.
- Ciro.

209
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,020
I need to speak to you.

210
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,300
Guys, please excuse us.

211
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,060
You have to do it.

212
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,100
What did he do?

213
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,740
That's not the point.

214
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,380
It's about what you are going to do.

215
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,620
You can't handle it?

216
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:16,100
This moment was coming,
you knew that too.

217
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,020
How does it feel, to kill someone?

218
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,860
Just like being born:
nobody asked for it.

219
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,260
Now you have to do it.

220
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,620
Giosuè, here's your pants...

221
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:08,060
your shirt and your socks.
You can dress yourself.

222
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:13,820
- Come on, Dad, help me.
- You're not a baby anymore, are you?

223
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:17,140
You're a man,
you have to dress yourself.

224
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,460
I'll wait for you there.

225
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,700
- Are you okay?
- Yes, just a bit tired.

226
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,140
- You're tired?
- A bit.

227
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,220
- Do you want me to help?
- I'm fine.

228
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:07,380
They really did put you to work.

229
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,220
- Are you hungry?
- Actually, yes.

230
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,740
- What do you want?
- Pizza.

231
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,940
I knew it, you always want pizza.

232
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,900
We've searched everything,
there's no one here.

233
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,300
- Sure?
- You can go inside.

234
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,100
Apparently Gennarino doesn't want
to cross me after all.

235
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,060
What are you going to do now?

236
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:26,100
Life is like poker,
I want to see the cards before I raise.

237
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,380
Donna Annalisa, good morning.

238
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,580
This way, please.

239
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,260
I'm here.

240
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,380
Hello, Annalisa.

241
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,740
Did you know that death
is the best business of all?

242
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:09,660
Why are you telling me that?
You think my time has come?

243
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,820
This store can be yours.

244
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,220
Do I have to become a grave digger,
or what?

245
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,220
Things are not going well
in Secondigliano.

246
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:28,780
The street sales are dropping
and you have to pay quite a few salaries.

247
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:33,180
I've found a solution for you.

248
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:44,420
Logos Logistics, Panareo Car Dealership,
Security Service...

249
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,900
What's all this?

250
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:51,020
Struggling companies that I bought,
just like this one.

251
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:57,380
We can divide them and set up a system,
just like the clans downtown.

252
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,180
I know how they do that.

253
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,540
The problem is...
I have a kind of hunch.

254
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,980
You're trying to cross me.

255
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,660
I don't want to cross you.
Think about it.

256
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:15,500
With your drugs profits,
you'll buy a share of 51%...

257
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,580
in the four branches
of this funeral home.

258
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:23,060
You can get people a job
and buy your supplies wherever you want.

259
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:28,980
And then I sell you the florist,
quarry and carpentry shop.

260
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:33,580
Your profits will go up and whoever
wants to work for you, has to pay.

261
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:38,540
We've always made
the biggest money on the streets.

262
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:46,420
But in Secondigliano,
drugs are not the biggest business.

263
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,980
Hunger is.

264
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:55,060
And we must take advantage
of that hunger.

265
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:03,300
We have to work together in Secondigliano
to get a stronger position.

266
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,980
Okay, Gennarino,
it's true you got back on your feet.

267
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:10,700
There's a problem.
It's best to wait here.

268
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:13,620
I decide for myself what's best for me.

269
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,940
Good morning, Annalisa.

270
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,860
Ciro Di Marzio.

271
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:27,220
When my father took over Secondigliano,
it was a slum...

272
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:31,420
where they dumped people
who were not welcome downtown.

273
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:35,460
My father saw a future in it...

274
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:39,060
and made it into the largest
drugs supermarket in Europe.

275
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:42,460
Do you know how they called us
downtown in the 1980s?

276
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,420
The little monkeys.

277
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:48,860
They treated us like animals
and wanted to lock us in cages.

278
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,180
- You remember that, right?
- Certainly.

279
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,700
Nobody will forget that.

280
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:58,460
But thanks to my father
they later became nice to us...

281
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,540
to get our drugs.

282
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:07,140
But that courtesy is no longer needed.
We don't sell anything here anymore.

283
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:11,180
We have to get on the streets downtown.

284
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,580
And who are they?

285
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,540
Our Trojan horse.

286
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,980
Do you know what this means?

287
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:38,460
We must prepare ourselves
for a war against the federation.

288
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,580
There's another funeral coming.

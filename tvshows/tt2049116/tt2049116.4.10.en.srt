00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,318
<i>In the Bay of Naples, a few kilometers
from Pompeii and Vesuvius,</i>

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,318
<i>lies the world's most surprising
underwater archeological site.</i>

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,760
<i>Here is the lost Roman city of Baia.</i>

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,518
<i>Since the first century BC
it has been an exclusive place...</i>

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,640
See the lovely parmigiana
Mom made for you?

7
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,120
Patrizia, will you tell me
what's the matter?

8
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,000
Last night I saw
a documentary about bees.

9
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,160
The males do nothing
from morning till night.

10
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,960
They only wake up
when the Queen sends for them.

11
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,920
They mate in flight for safety.

12
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,560
And they fuck so much
that their balls explode.

13
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,560
And then they die.

14
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,478
One after another,

15
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,400
'cause they're no good
for anything anymore.

16
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,200
That's all they can do.

17
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,278
From the samples you brought from Milan,
I see you do elegant stuff.

18
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,320
What's the retail price? 1,200?

19
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,560
You sell them to retailers at 500 max.

20
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,638
Once you buy fabric,
pay seamstresses, packing, shipping,

21
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,760
you're left with 10%, right?

22
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,278
Right.

23
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,680
Go with us
and your earnings will triple.

24
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,678
And how?

25
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,318
Our labor costs are low:
two or three euros an hour.

26
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,160
It depends what their work's like.

27
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,238
You only have to decide, Evelina.

28
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,718
You can work with subcontractors
in your area that cost more

29
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,278
and won't do an hour of overtime
for love or money,

30
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,280
or you can make real money with us.

31
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,798
- The paper pattern?
- I only have them for the samples.

32
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,558
- You'll do patterns and size-charts.
- No problem... Fabric?

33
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,000
I'll courier it all to you tomorrow.

34
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,160
- Dad, I got A in math!
- Well done!

35
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,958
What's the matter?

36
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,838
- You take a bath in perfume?
- You don't like it?

37
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,000
I like it, on a woman, though.

38
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,040
Let's go wash our hands,
dinner is ready.

39
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,760
Well done, Daddy's little scholar.

40
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,158
How did the checkup go?
Is the baby growing?

41
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,400
- Everything's good.
- And Patrizia?

42
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,080
She decided to have a rest.

43
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,840
Good, if only
she'd give it a rest for real.

44
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,598
What's happening
in Central Naples is no good,

45
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,840
and if the problem spreads
it'll weaken Secondigliano.

46
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,598
And to keep helping a weak clan

47
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,920
is too risky.

48
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,478
I don't think Patrizia's fit
to rule right now.

49
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,120
You're her husband,
make her see reason.

50
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,398
Now she has two options:

51
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,838
be a woman or a commander.

52
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,718
I'd like to know
what it is that you want,

53
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,198
if you want to raise a kid

54
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,640
or you want to mourn your wife.

55
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,678
Now let's eat, I'm starved.

56
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,918
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

57
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,358
Lord, bless this food.

58
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,838
Our Father...

59
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,920
Who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name...

60
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,560
The Levantes are behind the bust.

61
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,520
They want to take Secondigliano.

62
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,560
They blamed Nicola and killed him.

63
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,078
Now they're hand in hand
with the Graduate,

64
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,560
who took everything
that was Blue Blood's.

65
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,520
My husband's one of them, Gennaro.

66
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,000
And you didn't notice
anything, Patrizia?

67
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,678
I told you: a boss can never
trust anyone.

68
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,480
- I know.
- Doesn't look like it.

69
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,880
What are you going to do?

70
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,318
I can only do two things.

71
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,800
Be a wife and mother and leave
everything to the Levantes.

72
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,200
Or I wipe out every last one of them.

73
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,480
I handed over a kingdom to you.

74
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,320
Mine, the Savastanos'.

75
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,798
And you're still here
asking me which way to go.

76
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,680
No, Gennaro.

77
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,080
You're wrong.

78
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,800
I just wanted you to know.

79
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,560
This is my house.

80
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,520
And in my house I call the shots.

81
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,798
OUR BROTHERS

82
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,678
You're nuts coming here.

83
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,518
You know the Capaccios
run Forcella now.

84
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,040
Since you killed his brother,
the Graduate's looking all over for you.

85
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,280
I could have put it here for you.

86
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,240
I'm the one who needs to be pardoned.

87
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,838
I know what you're risking,
Pure'n'Simple,

88
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,320
but you gotta set up a meeting
for me with our most trusted guys.

89
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,480
You got it.

90
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,480
How do you feel?

91
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,000
I managed to get some rest.

92
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,278
I had to make a decision
before talking to you.

93
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,880
And I've made it.

94
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,320
I have to think about
our Bianca first.

95
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,640
It's best if I hand over the command
of Secondigliano to you.

96
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,920
Bianca?

97
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,760
That was my mother's name.

98
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,280
We'll do whatever you want, sweetheart.

99
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,880
This place is like a jail.

100
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,720
But if Patrizia hadn't given us
a crash pad, by now we'd be dead.

101
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,120
I don't want to mourn you.

102
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,120
I can't stop now.

103
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,000
First I gotta avenge our brothers.

104
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,760
You building a tower?

105
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,878
Things aren't going well, Azzurra.

106
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,998
Secondigliano's about to blow up.

107
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,800
- That's not our problem.
- Yes, it is.

108
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,000
When things are going well,
we're all friends.

109
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,798
But when things get outta balance,

110
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,560
who knows what could happen.

111
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,238
You put Patrizia there, for a reason:

112
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,920
to buy us our freedom.

113
00:17:02,825 --> 00:17:06,783
I hadn't heard the news.
Congratulations.

114
00:17:06,785 --> 00:17:10,225
- Thank you. So, how are things?
- Good.

115
00:17:14,105 --> 00:17:17,785
Igor, for the moment, I can't
personally handle the shipments.

116
00:17:18,825 --> 00:17:21,905
My husband Michelangelo
will handle them.

117
00:17:27,105 --> 00:17:29,425
Talk to him like you talk to me.

118
00:18:29,345 --> 00:18:30,705
One.

119
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,465
One.

120
00:18:42,945 --> 00:18:44,625
Gimme twenty.

121
00:19:14,505 --> 00:19:17,185
Morning, Don Michelangelo. Please.

122
00:20:04,305 --> 00:20:07,623
We're done here, Donna Patrizia.
It's 213 grand.

123
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,785
In line with last week,
maybe a bit more.

124
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:28,305
This isn't a neighborhood.

125
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,505
It's a city within a bigger city.

126
00:20:35,385 --> 00:20:38,265
Secondigliano doesn't answer to anyone.

127
00:20:43,585 --> 00:20:45,745
Enzo came to me.

128
00:20:48,785 --> 00:20:50,785
He loathes everyone.

129
00:20:52,225 --> 00:20:55,423
He says that your family's
behind the bust

130
00:20:55,425 --> 00:20:57,145
and now he asks for my help.

131
00:20:59,745 --> 00:21:02,025
He wants to kill you all.

132
00:21:03,465 --> 00:21:05,785
Why didn't you tell me straightaway?

133
00:21:06,945 --> 00:21:08,945
Because I had doubts.

134
00:21:10,745 --> 00:21:12,425
About me?

135
00:21:14,025 --> 00:21:15,665
Yeah.

136
00:21:17,545 --> 00:21:19,705
And now it's gone?

137
00:21:24,745 --> 00:21:26,745
No.

138
00:21:32,505 --> 00:21:34,625
But I've made a choice.

139
00:21:37,665 --> 00:21:39,665
Enzo's here...

140
00:21:41,665 --> 00:21:43,905
But you gotta make me a promise.

141
00:21:45,265 --> 00:21:50,825
You gotta make a choice,
like I did, and remove all doubt.

142
00:22:41,065 --> 00:22:43,025
Enzo...

143
00:22:46,705 --> 00:22:48,505
What have you done, bro'?

144
00:22:54,945 --> 00:22:57,465
Check out the hair.

145
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:01,545
Hey, Enzo.

146
00:23:07,705 --> 00:23:09,585
I'm glad to see you.

147
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:30,825
Patrizia and I have
the same enemy: the Levantes.

148
00:23:32,465 --> 00:23:35,183
First they used
the Capaccios like puppets,

149
00:23:35,185 --> 00:23:37,703
then they took our turf.

150
00:23:37,705 --> 00:23:39,945
We gotta hide to talk.

151
00:23:42,185 --> 00:23:44,743
They better not think
I've forgotten them.

152
00:23:44,745 --> 00:23:47,025
I think about them all the time.

153
00:23:51,225 --> 00:23:52,945
Night and day...

154
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:57,025
All the time.

155
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:01,345
What do you got in mind, Enzo?

156
00:24:49,305 --> 00:24:51,785
Patrizia just wants to be a mom.

157
00:24:54,225 --> 00:24:56,505
She's made up her mind.

158
00:24:58,305 --> 00:25:01,143
And she's handed everything over to me.

159
00:25:01,145 --> 00:25:03,145
Shipping, dealing spots...

160
00:25:04,305 --> 00:25:05,705
Secondigliano.

161
00:25:09,585 --> 00:25:14,225
She handed it over to me, Dad,
not to you.

162
00:25:25,185 --> 00:25:27,505
You never liked this place.

163
00:25:29,065 --> 00:25:33,865
You never came here to work,
but our family's fortune starts here.

164
00:25:38,545 --> 00:25:40,225
Michelangelo...

165
00:25:45,345 --> 00:25:48,023
To make concrete

166
00:25:48,025 --> 00:25:50,585
you need to mix sand with cement.

167
00:25:52,065 --> 00:25:56,383
And what comes out is a new substance,

168
00:25:56,385 --> 00:25:58,703
that belongs to us,

169
00:25:58,705 --> 00:26:01,105
it belongs to our family.

170
00:26:03,745 --> 00:26:07,625
You and Patrizia are like
sand and cement.

171
00:26:11,465 --> 00:26:17,025
You've become a substance
that can build something very big.

172
00:26:18,585 --> 00:26:23,065
And if you understand it,
so does she.

173
00:26:25,145 --> 00:26:26,985
You're right, Dad.

174
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,945
There's something else
we have to settle.

175
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,585
We have to kill Blue Blood.

176
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:30,425
- Well?
- It's good, I like it.

177
00:28:41,065 --> 00:28:42,983
Thanks for coming, guys.

178
00:28:42,985 --> 00:28:45,625
They told us you'd retired.

179
00:28:54,745 --> 00:28:58,063
Maybe it's time for me
to get back to work.

180
00:28:58,065 --> 00:29:01,025
We missed you, Don Gennaro.

181
00:29:03,585 --> 00:29:05,305
Let's go.

182
00:30:12,425 --> 00:30:13,945
Go, go!

183
00:30:21,705 --> 00:30:23,465
There's no one here.

184
00:30:29,345 --> 00:30:31,745
Run, it's a trap! Sons of bitches!

185
00:33:31,585 --> 00:33:33,263
You pieces of shit!

186
00:33:33,265 --> 00:33:35,505
Guys, after him!

187
00:34:25,385 --> 00:34:26,865
Mom?

188
00:34:28,265 --> 00:34:31,305
I'm fine, why? What's happened?

189
00:34:33,065 --> 00:34:34,745
Calm down, Mom.

190
00:34:36,705 --> 00:34:38,505
What are you saying?

191
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:41,465
And how are they?

192
00:34:43,105 --> 00:34:45,185
The main thing is that they're okay.

193
00:34:47,865 --> 00:34:49,625
I'll be right there.

194
00:34:57,385 --> 00:34:59,105
We failed.

195
00:36:24,105 --> 00:36:26,265
Good evening, Don Gennaro.

196
00:36:30,865 --> 00:36:34,583
Mistral's sorry,
but he couldn't come to the meeting.

197
00:36:34,585 --> 00:36:37,145
- He sent his regards.
- Don't worry about it.

198
00:36:38,305 --> 00:36:41,745
I know what it means
to live on high alert.

199
00:36:46,065 --> 00:36:49,303
With all due respect,

200
00:36:49,305 --> 00:36:52,903
we thought you'd retired
from our business.

201
00:36:52,905 --> 00:36:55,423
Or am I wrong?

202
00:36:55,425 --> 00:36:58,143
It's true.

203
00:36:58,145 --> 00:37:01,145
But now I've got money,
contacts and skills.

204
00:37:02,425 --> 00:37:05,945
Above all, I need to take back
everything that's mine.

205
00:37:09,385 --> 00:37:11,585
Excuse me, if you'll allow me...

206
00:37:15,465 --> 00:37:19,065
Can I ask you something Mistral
would have asked for sure?

207
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:23,425
Go ahead.

208
00:37:24,705 --> 00:37:27,225
Why did you choose him?

209
00:37:29,305 --> 00:37:32,465
The next war's gonna be long and hard.

210
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:37,943
And a man who had the guts to eat
his enemy's heart in prison

211
00:37:37,945 --> 00:37:39,785
is a man who'll do anything.

212
00:37:40,865 --> 00:37:44,105
And I need someone like that
to win this war.

213
00:37:45,465 --> 00:37:47,665
But that's water under the bridge.

214
00:37:49,065 --> 00:37:52,383
After that, he did 20 years
of maximum security

215
00:37:52,385 --> 00:37:56,025
and his friends all turned
their backs on him.

216
00:38:02,825 --> 00:38:04,705
I know.

217
00:38:07,465 --> 00:38:12,783
But I also know that he once had
enormous ambition

218
00:38:12,785 --> 00:38:15,785
and that's something that never dies.

219

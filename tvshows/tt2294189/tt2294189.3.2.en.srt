1
00:00:00,596 --> 00:00:02,775
- What's her name?
- Rose Stagg.

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:04,529
She's the woman we've
been searching for.

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,333
The gunshot wound that's coming in,

4
00:00:06,608 --> 00:00:09,255
- we think he's responsible for this.
- How's he doing?

5
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:11,851
I don't know. He's lost so much blood,

6
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:15,382
- he looks like he's dying.
- So he's the Belfast Strangler?

7
00:00:16,344 --> 00:00:19,745
- Wow.
- Daddy's been in an accident.

8
00:00:19,928 --> 00:00:21,610
He's in hospital.

9
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:25,180
- I really want to see him.
- Well, we can't, not tonight.

10
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:26,440
Olivia!

11
00:00:26,721 --> 00:00:28,314
Why did you run to him?

12
00:00:28,336 --> 00:00:30,207
You were crying out, "We're losing him."

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,160
You sounded very... anguished.

14
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,640
I want him to live.

15
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,633
So that he can be tried and sentenced

16
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,760
and spend the rest
of his life in prison.

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,546
He's in hospital.

18
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,809
In the General Hospital, I think.

19
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:44,369
I really need you to go there.

20
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:46,694
What do I... ? I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

21
00:00:53,714 --> 00:00:56,028
_

22
00:00:57,071 --> 00:00:58,600
You shouldn't be in here.

23
00:01:00,772 --> 00:01:02,048
Please leave.

26
00:04:17,984 --> 00:04:19,166
What are you doing here?

27
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,769
I'm on my way to the Policing Board.

28
00:04:21,308 --> 00:04:23,688
I have a meeting with Ombudsman's SIO.

29
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,747
We can drop you off.

30
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:27,760
- No, I have my car.
- It can follow.

31
00:04:54,132 --> 00:04:55,508
I've been instructed to confirm

32
00:04:55,525 --> 00:04:57,223
Spector's name to the press.

33
00:04:58,755 --> 00:05:00,869
- Why?
- The name is out there.

34
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:04,459
It'll just look foolish if
we continue to deny something

35
00:05:04,476 --> 00:05:06,440
that everybody else already knows.

36
00:05:06,734 --> 00:05:08,565
The DPP and the Chief

37
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:10,290
think it's in the public's interest.

38
00:05:12,887 --> 00:05:15,257
I want him tried in a
court of law, Jim, not in

39
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,733
a court of public opinion.

40
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:18,787
It's already a media circus.

41
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:20,707
Anyway,

42
00:05:21,661 --> 00:05:23,237
the decision's been made.

43
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,265
We're only holding two cards, Stella.

44
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,834
One: we have him.

45
00:05:31,106 --> 00:05:33,550
Two: we have her, and she's alive.

46
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,086
The rest is a disaster.

47
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,381
Is that what you wanted to tell me?

48
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,851
Actually, no.

49
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:45,553
The Task Force is being moved.

50
00:05:47,035 --> 00:05:48,400
What do you mean?

51
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,342
From the Major Investigation Room,

52
00:05:50,947 --> 00:05:52,600
from College Square Station.

53
00:05:53,455 --> 00:05:54,400
Why?

54
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,223
The room and the offices

55
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,698
are needed by the Terrorist
Investigations Unit.

56
00:06:01,655 --> 00:06:03,803
- Moved where?
- I don't know.

57
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,217
It's an office, an empty
space, I haven't seen it.

58
00:06:06,716 --> 00:06:08,240
When is this happening?

59
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,468
Right now, actually, as we speak.

60
00:06:13,614 --> 00:06:15,395
Why wasn't I informed?

61
00:06:15,423 --> 00:06:17,121
There's been quite a lot going on.

62
00:06:38,757 --> 00:06:41,970
Katie, you'll be late for school!

63
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,100
Why did you bring
Anderson onto your team?

64
00:07:21,088 --> 00:07:22,503
Why do you ask?

65
00:07:22,797 --> 00:07:24,734
Because it's a question
that's likely to be asked

66
00:07:24,734 --> 00:07:26,277
by people other than me.

67
00:07:28,369 --> 00:07:31,160
Because we lacked someone of
his rank in our Task Force.

68
00:07:31,343 --> 00:07:32,475
Yes, but...

69
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,062
why him?

70
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,860
He impressed me with the way he handled

71
00:07:35,865 --> 00:07:37,236
the McPherson suicide.

72
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:40,221
He thought of Rose, he
called the Task Force and...

73
00:07:41,153 --> 00:07:42,951
... he secured the scene efficiently.

74
00:07:42,968 --> 00:07:44,605
Except that it wasn't Rose,

75
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:46,425
and he failed to see a ligature

76
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,745
hanging from a tree
branch above the body.

77
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,447
I didn't say he was the
finished article, Jim,

78
00:07:51,447 --> 00:07:52,718
I saw potential.

79
00:07:54,188 --> 00:07:55,520
I see.

80
00:07:59,998 --> 00:08:01,435
What are you getting at?

81
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,177
I questioned

82
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,330
whether Anderson was man enough

83
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,661
for the task of being
shackled to Spector!

84
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:13,539
Anderson's size and strength

85
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,570
had no bearing whatsoever

86
00:08:15,592 --> 00:08:17,318
on what happened in the forest.

87
00:08:17,438 --> 00:08:20,026
If the nerve damage to
his arm doesn't repair,

88
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:21,640
he will be out of a career.

89
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,688
Questioning his manliness

90
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:26,101
is quite frankly pathetic!

91
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:31,634
Why did he arrive with you
in your car that morning?

92
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,968
- Eastwood.
- No.

93
00:08:40,595 --> 00:08:41,999
No, not Eastwood.

94
00:08:42,182 --> 00:08:43,808
I checked with the main gate.

95
00:08:43,841 --> 00:08:44,935
Why?

96
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,710
Because everything you do,

97
00:08:47,448 --> 00:08:49,063
every decision you make

98
00:08:49,091 --> 00:08:51,133
impacts on this case, Stella.

99
00:08:53,847 --> 00:08:55,640
Same goes for you, Jim.

100
00:09:13,973 --> 00:09:15,133
Drive on.

101
00:09:31,714 --> 00:09:33,074
Why aren't you in uniform?

102
00:09:33,296 --> 00:09:34,628
I have an exam.

103
00:09:34,684 --> 00:09:36,382
You don't have to wear
a uniform to an exam.

104
00:09:36,404 --> 00:09:38,080
You can't go out dressed like that.

105
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,360
- Come here.
- I'm late.

106
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,991
What is that?

107
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:45,815
Oh, my God, is that real?

108
00:09:45,935 --> 00:09:48,490
- Of course it's real.
- When did you do that?

109
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:50,440
- Just now.
- Why?

110
00:09:51,053 --> 00:09:52,235
Why not?

111
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,410
Katie, it looks awful.

112
00:09:55,142 --> 00:09:56,920
That's all you ever
care about, isn't it?

113
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,122
How I look,

114
00:09:58,242 --> 00:09:59,609
never how I feel.

115
00:10:02,821 --> 00:10:04,009
Katie!

116
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:15,760
Have you given your statement?

117
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,287
Yes, ma'am.

118
00:10:17,504 --> 00:10:18,780
How did it go?

119
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,856
I've been suspended from
all front-line duties

120
00:10:20,878 --> 00:10:22,437
while the investigation is ongoing.

121
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,930
He was armed.

122
00:10:25,368 --> 00:10:26,772
And he fired first.

123
00:10:27,432 --> 00:10:29,502
And given his character and his past,

124
00:10:29,513 --> 00:10:31,683
I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

125
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,480
Apart from taking another
human being's life.

126
00:10:38,108 --> 00:10:39,855
Not every woman's fighting instinct

127
00:10:39,855 --> 00:10:41,631
is so close to the surface.

128
00:10:42,502 --> 00:10:44,400
It's a good thing that yours was.

129
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:46,842
Tyler could have killed everyone there,

130
00:10:46,864 --> 00:10:49,411
including you and me, if
he hadn't been stopped.

131
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:56,426
Why don't you come back,

132
00:10:57,075 --> 00:10:58,829
work with the Task Force?

133
00:11:00,488 --> 00:11:02,663
- Really?
- Hmm.

134
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,383
You know the case.

135
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,703
You'd be a real help
in file preparation.

136
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:10,288
We've chosen to work in a masculine,

137
00:11:10,305 --> 00:11:12,635
paramilitary, patriarchal culture.

138
00:11:13,556 --> 00:11:15,437
Let's not let it beat us.

139
00:11:18,977 --> 00:11:20,375
Thank you, ma'am.

140
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,429
How is he?

141
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:32,971
He's been stable all night.

142
00:11:33,238 --> 00:11:36,160
Urine output steady, 30% oxygen...

143
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,958
pH is normal, lactate is one.

144
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:41,880
Hb was steady. What's his co-ag now?

145
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,880
Normal, Hb is 102.

146
00:11:44,075 --> 00:11:45,495
He's ready to rock.

147
00:11:45,795 --> 00:11:46,988
When will you be taking him?

148
00:11:47,108 --> 00:11:48,875
He's booked on the emergency list.

149
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,023
- Has he been X-rayed?
- Aye.

150
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,953
Are they bullet fragments?

151
00:11:57,987 --> 00:12:01,271
- Will you do anything about them?
- No, I wouldn't normally. They're tiny.

152
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,069
They won't clinically affect him.

153
00:12:03,074 --> 00:12:04,920
I expect the body to encapsulate them.

154
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,680
- I should think about ten o'clock.
- Aye.

155
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,548
Please wait here.

156
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,872
Good afternoon and welcome
to this private session

157
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:44,561
of the Policing Executive.

158
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,920
I'd like to welcome the Chief Constable

159
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,354
and the Assistant Chief
Constable Crime Operations,

160
00:12:50,365 --> 00:12:51,564
Jim Burns.

161
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,966
We'll start with Executive
members' questions

162
00:12:54,972 --> 00:12:56,392
to the Chief Constable.

163
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,480
- John Porter, please.
- Thank you, Chairperson.

164
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,471
Can the Chief Constable please
provide us with an update

165
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:06,217
on the progress of the
Operation Music Man Task Force?

166
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:12,066
I'd like to invite ACC
Burns to answer that one.

167
00:13:16,467 --> 00:13:18,197
Detective Superintendent Gibson?

168
00:13:18,317 --> 00:13:20,933
I'm Joan Kinkead, The Ombudsman's SIO.

169
00:13:21,053 --> 00:13:22,187
Please follow me.

170
00:13:25,822 --> 00:13:27,454
Please, take a seat.

171
00:13:28,702 --> 00:13:31,000
Am I being interviewed under caution?

172
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:32,942
Yes, you are.

173
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,120
Why wasn't I told in advance?

174
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,200
You're not under arrest. You're free
to leave the interview at any time,

175
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,080
seek legal advice at any time.

176
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,997
Do you want time to prepare?

177
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,446
To arrange representation?

178
00:13:45,561 --> 00:13:47,303
Are you suggesting there are grounds

179
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:49,784
for suspecting I've
committed a criminal offence?

180
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,096
If so, what offence?

181
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,587
If you're staying,

182
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,257
please take a seat and
turn off your mobile phone.

183
00:14:00,098 --> 00:14:01,486
What offence?

184
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,809
James Tyler had been physically violent

185
00:14:04,826 --> 00:14:06,358
towards the prisoner before.

186
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,483
He had become obsessed, it seems,

187
00:14:08,494 --> 00:14:10,431
with the idea that the
prisoner and his wife

188
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,043
were having some kind of
sexual relationship, something

189
00:14:13,243 --> 00:14:15,080
that we now believe to be untrue.

190
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,419
Even so, even given James Tyler's
history of sectarian violence,

191
00:14:19,436 --> 00:14:22,671
there was no evidence or
intelligence to suggest that...

192
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,840
that he would go to such lengths
to mount an attack on the prisoner.

193
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,842
Even though you knew he was
in possession of a weapon?

194
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,462
Having previously
disarmed a police officer

195
00:14:31,462 --> 00:14:33,800
- and stolen a police handgun.
- Even so.

196
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:38,332
Well, can you tell me
how that's even possible,

197
00:14:38,748 --> 00:14:42,139
with a coiled lanyard attaching
the gun to the gun belt?

198
00:14:44,281 --> 00:14:46,839
The young officer in question
had, for some reason...

199
00:14:48,814 --> 00:14:51,339
... failed to secure
his gun with the lanyard.

200
00:14:55,523 --> 00:14:58,287
The Police Ombudsman
investigates all discharges

201
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,640
of firearms by police
in Northern Ireland.

202
00:15:00,806 --> 00:15:03,309
During the investigation
I'll secure statements

203
00:15:03,331 --> 00:15:05,440
from the officers
involved in the incident.

204
00:15:05,618 --> 00:15:07,188
Now, as I understand it,

205
00:15:07,308 --> 00:15:10,124
you were in charge of
the police operation?

206
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,899
Yes, I was.

207
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,745
Do you think a sufficiently
robust risk assessment

208
00:15:15,762 --> 00:15:17,976
was carried out before
the prisoner was moved

209
00:15:18,031 --> 00:15:19,463
from the custody suite?

210
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,537
I asked Custody Sergeant Boyd

211
00:15:23,825 --> 00:15:27,038
to do a risk assessment of
the operation while I briefed

212
00:15:27,088 --> 00:15:28,792
Detective Sergeant Anderson.

213
00:15:31,644 --> 00:15:34,086
Do you think the operation was negligent

214
00:15:34,108 --> 00:15:35,385
in any way?

215
00:15:37,626 --> 00:15:41,333
The prisoner gave us no
real information in advance,

216
00:15:41,921 --> 00:15:45,083
gave us no indication whether
Rose was alive or dead.

217
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,553
On that basis the search scenario

218
00:15:47,565 --> 00:15:49,784
that was agreed with
Ged Green, the PolSA,

219
00:15:49,904 --> 00:15:52,647
was for the whole, alive or deceased,

220
00:15:52,692 --> 00:15:55,439
non-concealed presence of Rose Stagg.

221
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,359
If that did not succeed,

222
00:15:57,387 --> 00:15:59,695
it was agreed that we
would search the same area

223
00:15:59,717 --> 00:16:01,471
for the deceased, dismembered,

224
00:16:01,498 --> 00:16:05,249
sub-surface concealed
remains of Rose Stagg.

225
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:08,190
We had cover on the ground,

226
00:16:08,251 --> 00:16:10,926
there was air support
with thermal imaging.

227
00:16:11,902 --> 00:16:14,083
There wasn't time to arrange for dogs.

228
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:18,778
Do you have your decision log with you?

229
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:20,210
Yes.

230
00:16:20,909 --> 00:16:22,923
I've been policing for nearly 30 years,

231
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:24,754
most of it here in Northern Ireland.

232
00:16:25,336 --> 00:16:27,782
Now, we've had more than
our fair share of murderers,

233
00:16:27,805 --> 00:16:30,800
some of them no doubt
psychopaths, but none...

234
00:16:31,939 --> 00:16:33,509
none like this prisoner.

235
00:16:34,963 --> 00:16:37,971
Stella Gibson had - and still has -

236
00:16:38,287 --> 00:16:39,857
a special skill set

237
00:16:39,891 --> 00:16:41,982
developed over the course
of the long investigation

238
00:16:41,994 --> 00:16:43,703
into the Moon case that she led.

239
00:16:44,729 --> 00:16:47,876
She is a dedicated and
hard-working officer,

240
00:16:48,353 --> 00:16:50,151
and an inspirational leader.

241
00:16:50,739 --> 00:16:52,415
I kept in constant contact

242
00:16:52,421 --> 00:16:54,901
with ACC Burns and DCI Eastwood

243
00:16:54,912 --> 00:16:56,383
in the Serious Crime Suite.

244
00:16:56,411 --> 00:16:58,181
It was previously agreed that the convoy

245
00:16:58,203 --> 00:17:00,922
would be kept small so that
it didn't attract attention.

246
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:05,172
An ambulance, a second police
car and Inspector Green's TSGs

247
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:08,352
joined us at a previously
agreed rendezvous point.

248
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,513
It is possible that we could have

249
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:16,181
established a more secure
cordon in the forest,

250
00:17:16,231 --> 00:17:17,802
but everything that was done

251
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:20,860
was for the sole aim
of saving, if possible,

252
00:17:21,432 --> 00:17:23,180
the life of Rose Stagg.

253
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,547
Who's that?

254
00:17:38,873 --> 00:17:41,848
- Who is that?
- It's just a patient. Road traffic accident.

255
00:17:42,463 --> 00:17:43,906
Who was it?

256
00:17:44,755 --> 00:17:46,559
OK, just relax now.

257
00:17:46,587 --> 00:17:48,612
OK, everything's fine, lie back.

258
00:17:48,732 --> 00:17:50,405
OK, lie down for me.

259
00:17:50,433 --> 00:17:52,930
Come on, lie down and relax.

260
00:17:53,207 --> 00:17:55,787
Just lie back, you're fine, I'm here.

261
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:57,174
I need you to do

262
00:17:57,196 --> 00:18:00,153
a few big, deep breaths for
me, OK? Through your nose.

263
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,400
In nice and deep, and out. Very good.

264
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:06,320
There she is.

265
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,380
Why did you go into
the forest on your own?

266
00:18:11,801 --> 00:18:14,187
I wanted to keep the
potential contamination

267
00:18:14,187 --> 00:18:15,686
of the scene to a minimum.

268
00:18:17,372 --> 00:18:18,725
At the car, why didn't you wait

269
00:18:18,737 --> 00:18:20,429
to have it assessed for booby traps?

270
00:18:20,451 --> 00:18:22,272
Were you not taking a considerable risk

271
00:18:22,277 --> 00:18:23,637
in forcing it open?

272
00:18:24,857 --> 00:18:27,694
The individual charged is a murderer,

273
00:18:28,121 --> 00:18:29,730
not a terrorist.

274
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:33,870
I knew that Rose was in that boot.

275
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:37,106
I don't know how I knew, I just knew.

276
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,023
And I needed to get to her.

277
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,058
Would it not have been better

278
00:18:44,713 --> 00:18:47,160
to try and get into the
boot through the rear seat?

279
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,942
In that moment, it didn't occur to me.

280
00:19:03,864 --> 00:19:07,440
The ED consultant told
me, that in his opinion,

281
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:11,389
Rose Stagg was very nearly
dead when we found her.

282
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,714
Maybe 15 minutes,

283
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:17,642
maybe an hour away from her
body simply shutting down.

284
00:19:21,217 --> 00:19:23,031
Everything that I did

285
00:19:24,418 --> 00:19:27,465
was done for the sole
purpose of saving her life...

286
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:30,572
which is, as you know,

287
00:19:30,988 --> 00:19:33,075
the first duty of a police officer.

288
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:43,020
And what about Mr Spector's life?

289
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,200
Did you not have a duty to protect that?

290
00:19:48,825 --> 00:19:50,760
OK, we are going to have
to soak this, please.

291
00:19:58,175 --> 00:20:00,029
We had four packs in here, right?

292
00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:01,571
Yes, that's right.

293
00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:05,040
One...

294
00:20:08,397 --> 00:20:09,760
... two...

295
00:20:10,728 --> 00:20:12,947
Did you draw your weapon?

296
00:20:13,652 --> 00:20:15,072
I didn't need to.

297
00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:18,462
The patrol officer

298
00:20:18,873 --> 00:20:20,432
acted immediately.

299
00:20:21,204 --> 00:20:22,807
And if it wasn't for her...

300
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:26,108
many more lives would have been lost.

301
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,567
I instructed

302
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:31,198
Inspector Green to call
for medical back-up.

303
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,505
The prisoner was dying.

304
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:38,167
The ambulance transporting
Rose had already left,

305
00:20:38,184 --> 00:20:39,893
I didn't think it should be recalled.

306
00:20:40,013 --> 00:20:41,796
The helicopter couldn't land.

307
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,646
We waited for the rapid response vehicle

308
00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:46,280
and for the second ambulance.

309
00:20:48,106 --> 00:20:50,320
Meanwhile, the prisoner
was bleeding to death.

310
00:20:52,101 --> 00:20:54,143
He was in your arms?

311
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,951
Yes, he was.

312
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,958
I hoped that

313
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:04,486
by holding him that way I
could keep his airway unblocked,

314
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:05,907
keep him from choking.

315
00:21:06,983 --> 00:21:09,747
In that position, I could
put pressure on his wound.

316
00:21:11,967 --> 00:21:13,310
I see.

317
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:16,360
How much longer?

318
00:21:17,927 --> 00:21:19,686
Diaphragm is stable.

319
00:21:22,694 --> 00:21:24,342
OK, I'm running the gut.

320
00:21:26,883 --> 00:21:28,764
I can't see any re-bleeding.

321
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,960
OK, that's all fine.

322
00:21:38,087 --> 00:21:39,974
All right, wash out, please.

323
00:21:40,889 --> 00:21:42,182
And suction.

324
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,634
You knew

325
00:21:45,867 --> 00:21:48,991
James Tyler had made threats
against Mr Spector's life.

326
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,571
You knew he was at large

327
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:53,947
armed with a gun he'd
used to terrorise his wife

328
00:21:53,952 --> 00:21:55,595
and the other women at the refuge.

329
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:58,990
Why was Mr Spector standing out

330
00:21:59,001 --> 00:22:01,877
in the open and not being
held inside a police vehicle?

331
00:22:02,898 --> 00:22:05,717
Why were neither he nor
Detective Sergeant Anderson

332
00:22:05,755 --> 00:22:07,465
wearing ballistic body armour?

333
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,985
Why weren't you?

334
00:22:11,044 --> 00:22:13,819
The Director of Public
Prosecutions George Lowden

335
00:22:13,842 --> 00:22:16,084
and the Chief Constable Malcolm Franks

336
00:22:16,204 --> 00:22:18,509
have decided to take the unusual step

337
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:21,173
of naming the man arrested and charged

338
00:22:21,195 --> 00:22:24,520
in connection with the recent
spate of murders in south Belfast.

339
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:28,348
I can confirm that the
individual is Paul Spector,

340
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,729
also known as Peter Baldwin,

341
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:34,481
a 32-year-old bereavement
counsellor from south Belfast.

342
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,290
He is a married man,

343
00:22:36,484 --> 00:22:38,276
the father of two children,

344
00:22:38,326 --> 00:22:40,435
and as has already been established,

345
00:22:40,462 --> 00:22:43,087
he is critically ill
in hospital as a result

346
00:22:43,087 --> 00:22:46,744
of an incident that took
place whilst in police custody.

347
00:23:38,294 --> 00:23:39,520
How'd the re-look go?

348
00:23:39,948 --> 00:23:41,279
The abdominal packs were removed.

349
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,605
There was no active bleeding.

350
00:23:42,617 --> 00:23:44,913
The abdomen was closed with
standard mass closure to the sheath

351
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:47,205
and routine skin closure with staples.

352
00:23:48,665 --> 00:23:50,795
Let's lighten him up. What's he on?

353
00:23:50,856 --> 00:23:54,091
Propofol is at 10ml an
hour and alfentanil is at 5.

354
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:57,337
Chip away at the propofol.

355
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:06,080
_

356
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,375
_

357
00:24:18,346 --> 00:24:20,742
_

358
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:37,048
_

359
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,120
Who is this?

360
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,345
Katie? It's Olivia.

361
00:24:46,389 --> 00:24:48,088
Do you know what happened to Daddy?

362
00:24:49,556 --> 00:24:50,832
No.

363
00:24:50,952 --> 00:24:52,095
Do you?

364
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,999
He's in hospital, I think.

365
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,055
- Have you been to see him?
- No.

366
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,346
Do you have a friend called Daisy?

367
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:01,493
Why?

368
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,858
There's something about her online.

369
00:25:04,113 --> 00:25:07,194
- What?
- How she met Daddy one time.

370
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,128
- What?
- What are you two doing?

371
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,767
You know you're not allowed
to use the staff phone.

372
00:25:14,949 --> 00:25:16,511
Right, come on with me.

373
00:25:18,515 --> 00:25:22,281
_

374
00:25:22,336 --> 00:25:25,834
_

375
00:25:33,222 --> 00:25:39,109
_

376
00:25:54,613 --> 00:25:57,668
We're thinking of putting
two more over there.

377
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,779
There are two offices, ma'am.

378
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,634
I've earmarked one for you.

379
00:26:11,932 --> 00:26:14,366
The contents of your old
office are still in boxes.

380
00:26:14,486 --> 00:26:16,545
I'll have them brought in.

381
00:26:17,111 --> 00:26:18,991
It's less of a dungeon.

382
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,679
- Mmm.
- We'll make it work.

383
00:26:45,311 --> 00:26:46,720
Paul?

384
00:26:48,803 --> 00:26:51,112
Paul, can you open your eyes for me?

385
00:26:51,853 --> 00:26:53,272
Paul...

386
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,973
Paul, open your eyes for me.

387
00:26:56,757 --> 00:26:59,197
Paul, can you open your eyes for me?

388
00:27:02,209 --> 00:27:05,135
OK, that's good, that's very good.

389
00:27:12,577 --> 00:27:14,593
I need some help in here!

390
00:27:15,894 --> 00:27:17,525
I need some help!

391
00:27:23,007 --> 00:27:24,351
I got him.

392
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,654
He's biting down on his tube!

393
00:27:29,991 --> 00:27:32,654
His sats are dropping,
he needs sedation.

394
00:27:40,652 --> 00:27:42,058
Ahhh.

395
00:27:49,165 --> 00:27:51,618
Increase oxygen to 100%.

396
00:28:20,147 --> 00:28:22,879
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, of course.

397
00:28:30,361 --> 00:28:32,320
Well, that was a wake up with a bang.

398
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,240
- Rose, what are you doing?
- I want to go home.

399
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,739
You're scheduled to be
moved to another ward later.

400
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,123
No, no, I want to go home.
I want to call my husband.

401
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:54,560
I want some clothes.

402
00:28:54,616 --> 00:28:56,545
- Calm...
- I want to go home!

403
00:28:58,424 --> 00:29:01,063
- I want to go home.
- OK.

404
00:29:29,867 --> 00:29:32,201
I've just seen Katie
Benedetto approaching the ICU.

405
00:29:32,207 --> 00:29:33,458
Copy that.

406
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,194
Maybe there's been some cerebral damage

407
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:43,061
from the prolonged hypotension.

408
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,629
I'm not sure we can MRI
with the bullet fragments.

409
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,454
We'll keep him asleep
and arrange a CT scan.

410
00:29:50,516 --> 00:29:53,062
Check all his lines, check
everything is still in place,

411
00:29:53,087 --> 00:29:54,848
that he hasn't burst his stitches.

412
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,221
Are you OK? Did he hurt you?

413
00:29:58,476 --> 00:29:59,727
No, I'm fine.

414
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,276
Mrs Spector.

415
00:30:32,494 --> 00:30:35,307
Come on in, the head wants to see you.

416
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,080
Olivia admits accessing a school
computer without permission,

417
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:47,525
and she was found using
a staff-only phone.

418
00:30:48,204 --> 00:30:50,886
I've had parents contacting
the school all day long,

419
00:30:51,006 --> 00:30:53,114
even before the announcement was made.

420
00:30:53,874 --> 00:30:56,164
Staff are deeply concerned.

421
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,166
Olivia and Liam have already
been on the receiving end of...

422
00:31:00,913 --> 00:31:03,480
unkind comments from other pupils.

423
00:31:05,842 --> 00:31:08,456
I have to put their welfare first.

424
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,946
The last thing I want is for them

425
00:31:10,965 --> 00:31:12,640
to be vilified for something that...

426
00:31:13,852 --> 00:31:15,327
For something that may
or may not have been done

427
00:31:15,342 --> 00:31:16,771
by one of their parents.

428
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:21,615
I... I've never been
in this position before.

429
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:24,577
I don't know anyone who has.

430
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,832
Maybe in the past,

431
00:31:26,867 --> 00:31:28,132
during the Troubles.

432
00:31:29,222 --> 00:31:31,064
Perhaps if you kept them at home,

433
00:31:31,338 --> 00:31:32,840
for even a few days,

434
00:31:33,115 --> 00:31:34,680
so we could take stock.

435
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,889
I can discuss the situation
with the governors.

436
00:31:40,851 --> 00:31:42,191
I'm sorry.

437
00:32:13,756 --> 00:32:16,579
I apologise for the move.

438
00:32:18,153 --> 00:32:19,691
Not my idea.

439
00:32:22,161 --> 00:32:23,999
Please be aware:

440
00:32:24,163 --> 00:32:27,987
disclosure rules mean
that every DNA lift,

441
00:32:28,007 --> 00:32:29,888
every scene-of-crime log,

442
00:32:29,898 --> 00:32:31,900
every crime scene shot,

443
00:32:31,915 --> 00:32:34,265
every entry in a notebook

444
00:32:35,266 --> 00:32:37,616
must be kept to comply with the

445
00:32:37,695 --> 00:32:40,374
retention of materials guidelines.

446
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,620
I want records right down to

447
00:32:44,904 --> 00:32:46,607
when and at what time

448
00:32:46,617 --> 00:32:49,280
officers changed their forensic capes.

449
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,710
We cannot give the defence

450
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:55,803
any chance of challenging the
continuity of our exhibits.

451
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,959
Organisation

452
00:32:59,476 --> 00:33:02,200
is crucially important

453
00:33:02,374 --> 00:33:05,098
to the next stage of our investigations:

454
00:33:05,916 --> 00:33:07,817
case construction.

455
00:33:08,838 --> 00:33:12,294
I don't know what's going
to happen with Spector,

456
00:33:12,314 --> 00:33:15,401
or how long it will take him
to recover from his injuries...

457
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,140
but we cannot take our foot

458
00:33:19,145 --> 00:33:20,708
off the gas for a minute.

459
00:33:21,027 --> 00:33:22,725
We need to look for

460
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,000
as much further evidence as we can...

461
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:28,695
... to corroborate our account

462
00:33:28,989 --> 00:33:32,080
and construct an
evidenced case narrative.

463
00:33:32,932 --> 00:33:35,053
We need to predict any potential

464
00:33:35,173 --> 00:33:37,094
weaknesses in our case

465
00:33:37,109 --> 00:33:39,758
and plug any gaps with evidence.

466
00:33:39,773 --> 00:33:40,839
Real evidence,

467
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:43,826
documentary evidence,
circumstantial evidence,

468
00:33:43,886 --> 00:33:45,549
witness testimonies.

469
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,360
Evidence that carries weight.

470
00:33:50,837 --> 00:33:52,460
Mistakes have been made.

471
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,064
No more mistakes.

472
00:34:03,607 --> 00:34:05,760
What's happening with Rose's car?

473
00:34:06,331 --> 00:34:08,835
It's been recovered and
it's being worked on.

474
00:34:09,253 --> 00:34:11,887
It's been processed for
DNA and trace evidence.

475
00:34:12,101 --> 00:34:14,160
They're dusting for prints tomorrow.

476
00:34:18,896 --> 00:34:21,610
It seems a man has come forward

477
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:24,400
having seen Spector's
photograph on the news.

478
00:34:24,941 --> 00:34:27,012
He says Spector looks
like a man who rents

479
00:34:27,017 --> 00:34:29,178
a lock-up from him in east Belfast,

480
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,150
under the name Baldwin.

481
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:36,377
Let's get a warrant for that.

482
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,520
Paul?

483
00:34:40,022 --> 00:34:41,376
Paul?

484
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,523
Paul, can you hear me?

485
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:48,789
Paul, I'm Kiera, I'm your nurse.

486
00:34:50,313 --> 00:34:51,642
Can you hear me?

487
00:34:55,809 --> 00:34:58,349
OK, I'm going to say
a series of letters.

488
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:01,381
And I want you to squeeze my hand

489
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,303
whenever I say the letter A.

490
00:35:03,741 --> 00:35:06,325
Every time I say the letter A, OK?

491
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:11,000
S.

492
00:35:11,847 --> 00:35:12,992
A.

493
00:35:15,482 --> 00:35:16,741
V.

494
00:35:17,737 --> 00:35:18,952
E.

495
00:35:20,614 --> 00:35:21,894
A.

496
00:35:24,657 --> 00:35:25,941
H.

497
00:35:27,663 --> 00:35:28,963
A.

498
00:35:30,466 --> 00:35:31,781
R.

499
00:35:33,712 --> 00:35:34,932
T.

500
00:35:37,451 --> 00:35:39,727
OK, that's good. That's very good, Paul.

501
00:35:42,899 --> 00:35:45,149
Now hold up this many fingers.

502
00:35:51,761 --> 00:35:52,837
OK.

503
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,008
And now with the other hand.

504
00:36:04,358 --> 00:36:06,563
And now add one more finger.

505
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:15,868
OK, that's good. That's very good, Paul.

506
00:36:44,352 --> 00:36:45,418
Cuff down.

507
00:36:48,968 --> 00:36:50,160
OK.

508
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,836
And back down.

509
00:37:28,008 --> 00:37:29,198
Gibson.

510
00:37:29,318 --> 00:37:31,184
- It's Hagstrom, ma'am.
- Yeah?

511
00:37:31,463 --> 00:37:33,813
It seems Spector's
regained consciousness.

512
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:35,550
There's a lot of coming and going.

513
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,880
I'm told...

514
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,880
... he's drowsy but alert.

515
00:37:39,444 --> 00:37:40,520
I see.

516
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,796
Thank you.

517
00:37:44,035 --> 00:37:45,190
Keep me posted.

518
00:37:45,499 --> 00:37:46,760
Yes, ma'am.

519
00:37:58,012 --> 00:38:00,320
OK, Paul, I'm just
changing your dressing.

520
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,097
Who are you?

521
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:05,945
I'm Kiera.

522
00:38:06,109 --> 00:38:07,160
I'm your nurse.

523
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,604
Where am I?

524
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,264
You're in Belfast General Hospital.

525
00:38:13,587 --> 00:38:15,544
You're in the Intensive Care Unit.

526
00:38:16,535 --> 00:38:19,408
You've had an operation but
you're doing really well.

527
00:38:20,991 --> 00:38:22,406
An operation?

528
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,846
Now just sit back.

529
00:38:25,856 --> 00:38:27,600
You're OK, just relax back.

530
00:38:28,235 --> 00:38:29,968
I'll get the doctor to explain more,

531
00:38:29,968 --> 00:38:31,895
but right now just let
me check this wound.

532
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,181
Here you go.

533
00:38:48,415 --> 00:38:49,600
Thanks.

534
00:38:52,681 --> 00:38:54,185
I've been thinking,

535
00:38:54,807 --> 00:38:57,481
you should really arrange for
him to have representation.

536
00:38:57,805 --> 00:38:58,920
A solicitor.

537
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,828
Isn't it too late for that?

538
00:39:01,867 --> 00:39:02,903
Not at all.

539
00:39:03,396 --> 00:39:05,806
Now he's come round,
he needs legal advice.

540
00:39:06,831 --> 00:39:08,280
It's the right thing to do.

541
00:39:11,647 --> 00:39:15,092
Is there someone in your
firm that can represent him?

542
00:39:15,401 --> 00:39:17,129
That would be a conflict of interests,

543
00:39:17,492 --> 00:39:18,812
we represent you.

544
00:39:19,877 --> 00:39:20,944
Besides,

545
00:39:21,287 --> 00:39:22,442
there's really only

546
00:39:22,726 --> 00:39:25,390
one person in Belfast who
can handle a case this big.

547
00:39:26,037 --> 00:39:28,357
I can make the call on your behalf,

548
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,747
but it has to come
from you as next of kin.

549
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,616
Are you going to go and visit Paul?

550
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:41,437
Don't you think Olivia at
least should go see him?

551
00:39:55,642 --> 00:39:56,852
Lyon & Healy.

552
00:39:56,887 --> 00:39:58,719
Yes, hello, it's Steve Jennings

553
00:39:58,734 --> 00:40:01,080
calling from Simon &
Patrick for Sean Healy.

554
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,642
I'll see if he's available.

555
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,485
Mr Spector?

556
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:14,160
Mr Spector.

557
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:19,537
I'm Dr Spencer,

558
00:40:19,556 --> 00:40:21,070
I'm the ICU consultant.

559
00:40:23,545 --> 00:40:24,960
Do you know where you are?

560
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,651
I'm in the Belfast General Hospital.

561
00:40:32,284 --> 00:40:33,440
She told me.

562
00:40:35,774 --> 00:40:37,332
And do you know why you're here?

563
00:40:38,826 --> 00:40:40,612
I was in a car accident.

564
00:40:42,699 --> 00:40:44,080
Do you remember what happened?

565
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,649
Windscreen smashed.

566
00:40:51,128 --> 00:40:52,701
I lost control.

567
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:57,160
What's your second name?

568
00:40:59,826 --> 00:41:01,051
Peter.

569
00:41:01,469 --> 00:41:02,744
And your surname?

570
00:41:06,399 --> 00:41:07,783
Spector.

571
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:11,557
Spec-tor.

572
00:41:14,321 --> 00:41:15,710
Where were you born?

573
00:41:17,104 --> 00:41:18,189
No.

574
00:41:19,031 --> 00:41:20,047
No, where?

575
00:41:20,117 --> 00:41:21,451
Where were you born, Paul?

576
00:41:22,621 --> 00:41:23,800
Belfast.

577
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:27,899
What's your date of birth?

578
00:41:27,909 --> 00:41:28,989
Do you remember that?

579
00:41:31,902 --> 00:41:34,835
25th of the fifth, 1979.

580
00:41:36,259 --> 00:41:37,649
So how old are you?

581
00:41:38,868 --> 00:41:39,880
26.

582
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:44,142
What year do you think it is?

583
00:41:48,181 --> 00:41:49,475
Um...

584
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,387
it's 2006.

585
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,387
And what season is it?

586
00:41:58,294 --> 00:41:59,360
It's warm.

587
00:42:02,012 --> 00:42:03,312
Are you married?

588
00:42:03,432 --> 00:42:05,640
Um...

589
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,116
Yes.

590
00:42:07,648 --> 00:42:09,028
And what's your wife's name?

591
00:42:09,516 --> 00:42:10,591
Sally.

592
00:42:13,066 --> 00:42:14,564
Do you have any children?

593
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:17,960
A daughter.

594
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,952
What's her name?

595
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:22,849
Livy.

596
00:42:23,322 --> 00:42:24,457
Olivia.

597
00:42:25,633 --> 00:42:27,120
And how old is Livy?

598
00:42:29,676 --> 00:42:30,720
Small.

599
00:42:41,327 --> 00:42:42,433
Mummy?

600
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,847
Nancy!

601
00:42:44,459 --> 00:42:46,327
Come here.

602
00:42:49,229 --> 00:42:51,609
Oh, it's so good to see you.

603
00:42:52,576 --> 00:42:54,303
How are you, my angel?

604
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,856
- Good.
- Are you good?

605
00:42:56,474 --> 00:42:59,058
- Did Daddy take care of you?
- Yes.

606
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:04,240
Thank you.

607
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,159
Are you OK?

608
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,499
What's wrong?

609
00:43:13,044 --> 00:43:14,800
What's happened to all these people?

610
00:43:17,709 --> 00:43:19,397
They're not very well.

611
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,154
That's a shame.

612
00:43:22,464 --> 00:43:23,659
It is.

613
00:43:43,865 --> 00:43:46,760
We've just landed a not
uninteresting little case.

614
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:48,040
The telephone call?

615
00:43:48,516 --> 00:43:49,681
Do you want in?

616
00:43:50,005 --> 00:43:51,534
Are you going to tell me what it is?

617
00:43:52,555 --> 00:43:54,240
The Belfast Strangler.

618
00:43:54,437 --> 00:43:56,110
Or rather, the man the police claim

619
00:43:56,145 --> 00:43:57,489
is the Belfast Strangler.

620
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,430
- The man in hospital?
- The same.

621
00:44:00,526 --> 00:44:01,960
The name's Paul Spector.

622
00:44:02,129 --> 00:44:03,659
He's in the critical care unit

623
00:44:03,669 --> 00:44:05,496
at the Belfast General Hospital.

624
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,090
Inform the custody sergeant
at the Down Serious Crime Suite

625
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,385
that we've been retained by
the suspect's next of kin,

626
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:13,451
namely his wife, Sally Anne Spector.

627
00:44:13,571 --> 00:44:15,101
Obtain a copy of the charge sheet

628
00:44:15,104 --> 00:44:16,618
and the custody record.

629
00:44:17,693 --> 00:44:19,520
Jennings says he's confessed.

630
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:20,531
As soon as you get them,

631
00:44:20,536 --> 00:44:22,418
I want those tapes transcribed.

632
00:44:22,443 --> 00:44:24,106
Through the night, if necessary.

633
00:44:27,854 --> 00:44:29,706
You weren't in a crash, Paul.

634
00:44:30,463 --> 00:44:31,504
You were shot.

635
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,654
Shot in the abdomen.

636
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:36,646
One of the bullets was superficial,

637
00:44:36,646 --> 00:44:38,169
just below the skin.

638
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,172
The other one pierced the spleen

639
00:44:41,854 --> 00:44:43,452
and we think it probably hit a rib,

640
00:44:43,457 --> 00:44:44,880
because it fragmented.

641
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,057
The organ was so badly damaged,

642
00:44:47,072 --> 00:44:48,197
we had to remove it.

643
00:44:49,477 --> 00:44:52,440
You're very lucky that the
bullets hit no other vital organs,

644
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,998
but all the same,

645
00:44:54,466 --> 00:44:56,089
there was massive blood loss.

646
00:44:56,717 --> 00:44:58,036
It was touch and go.

647
00:45:00,675 --> 00:45:02,069
Why was I shot?

648
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,727
You were in police custody at the time.

649
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,611
What?

650
00:45:10,951 --> 00:45:12,789
Why was I in police custody?

651
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,223
I can't tell you that at the moment,

652
00:45:16,228 --> 00:45:18,090
I genuinely don't know the answer.

653
00:45:20,237 --> 00:45:22,164
It's something you can
discuss with your solicitor

654
00:45:22,174 --> 00:45:23,781
when you're a little stronger.

655
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,038
A solicitor?

656
00:45:27,596 --> 00:45:29,273
Why would I need a solicitor?

657
00:45:30,822 --> 00:45:33,560
We're only here to look
after you medically, Paul.

658
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,314
All right? The rest is best
left to others to explain.

659
00:45:48,696 --> 00:45:51,160
- Gibson.
- It's Hagstrom again, ma'am.

660
00:45:51,439 --> 00:45:52,520
Yep?

661
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,280
Rose Stagg is discharging
herself from the ICU.

662
00:45:56,557 --> 00:45:57,720
What?

663
00:45:59,182 --> 00:46:00,160
Why?

664
00:46:00,531 --> 00:46:01,926
Something spooked her.

665
00:46:02,378 --> 00:46:04,280
She must know Spector's here somehow.

666
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,440
Jesus.

667
00:46:07,621 --> 00:46:09,019
Who's the consultant?

668
00:46:09,483 --> 00:46:11,429
Dr Patrick Spencer, ma'am.

669
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,476
OK, thanks.

670
00:46:15,168 --> 00:46:16,074
Shit.

671
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,482
I just took a call from
Boyd at the custody suite.

672
00:46:22,741 --> 00:46:24,718
It seems that at his wife's request,

673
00:46:25,146 --> 00:46:26,929
Spector now has a solicitor.

674
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,756
Sean Healy.

675
00:46:29,742 --> 00:46:31,673
To my mind, he is an
arrogant, manipulative,

676
00:46:31,703 --> 00:46:33,580
too-clever-by-half bastard.

677
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:36,015
But he's a winner.

678
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:39,246
If there is a loophole,
he's going to exploit it.

679
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:42,616
We can expect turbulence at every turn.

680
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,077
Great!

681
00:46:46,705 --> 00:46:48,099
Ready when you are.

682
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,827
Don't let Liam stay up too late.

683
00:47:26,061 --> 00:47:28,042
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

684
00:47:29,879 --> 00:47:31,667
OK, in you go.

685
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:37,640
All right, Olivia?

686
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:40,465
- See you later, cheerio.
- See you later. Thanks.

687
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:54,346
What do you think has happened to Daddy?

688
00:47:55,452 --> 00:47:56,911
He's been shot.

689
00:47:57,254 --> 00:47:58,608
Who told you that?

690
00:47:59,026 --> 00:48:01,217
Everyone in school was saying it.

691
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,045
Did you see things online?

692
00:48:04,598 --> 00:48:05,469
Yes.

693
00:48:06,121 --> 00:48:07,859
I don't want you doing that, Olivia.

694
00:48:07,869 --> 00:48:09,790
I don't want you going online.

695
00:48:10,174 --> 00:48:11,180
OK.

696
00:48:15,481 --> 00:48:17,360
Did they say why he'd been shot?

697
00:48:17,607 --> 00:48:19,200
They said the police did it.

698
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:20,440
But why?

699
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,604
Because he's killed people.

700
00:48:24,848 --> 00:48:25,928
People?

701
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:27,427
Ladies.

702
00:48:29,962 --> 00:48:31,485
Do you believe that?

703
00:48:32,352 --> 00:48:33,477
No.

704
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,699
I just want to see him.

705
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:45,571
I don't want him to be
frightened and all alone.

706
00:48:46,682 --> 00:48:48,161
Please, Mummy.

707
00:49:08,584 --> 00:49:11,555
- How much is a taxi?
- It'll be, like, a fiver.

708
00:49:28,605 --> 00:49:30,831
What are you doing here?
You missed your exam.

709
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,554
You're a fucking brunette now?

710
00:49:32,674 --> 00:49:34,048
Yeah, why not?

711
00:49:34,934 --> 00:49:37,189
Why have you been
telling lies about Paul?

712
00:49:39,116 --> 00:49:40,400
I haven't.

713
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,019
- You said he left comments on your videos.
- He did.

714
00:49:43,294 --> 00:49:45,280
- You're a liar!
- What?!

715
00:49:45,674 --> 00:49:46,914
You want to see?

716
00:49:47,312 --> 00:49:48,642
I'll show you.

717
00:49:50,056 --> 00:49:52,357
- What is the matter with you?!
- You stay away from him!

718
00:49:52,417 --> 00:49:53,920
I haven't been near him!

719
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:54,921
You need to get a grip,

720
00:49:54,926 --> 00:49:57,166
you're obsessed, it's pathetic!

721
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,011
- Who's pathetic now?
- My eyes!

722
00:50:03,131 --> 00:50:04,883
- My eyes!
- We need an ambulance!

723
00:50:08,995 --> 00:50:12,147
- My eyes! My eyes!
- Pour some water on her eyes.

724
00:50:16,818 --> 00:50:18,416
I understand you're a nurse?

725
00:50:19,272 --> 00:50:22,070
Your husband was hypotensive
for a good 20 minutes.

726
00:50:22,459 --> 00:50:24,571
He was peri-arrest
for most of that time.

727
00:50:24,691 --> 00:50:26,353
He's able to talk, but...

728
00:50:26,473 --> 00:50:27,980
he's disorientated,

729
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:29,514
confused.

730
00:50:29,897 --> 00:50:32,925
He doesn't seem to have
remembered what happened to him,

731
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,862
what actually brought him here,

732
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,873
or that he was in
police custody, or why.

733
00:50:39,043 --> 00:50:41,000
I think that explanation is best left

734
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:42,772
to his solicitor when he's stronger.

735
00:50:45,367 --> 00:50:47,428
Young children can find
it quite distressing

736
00:50:47,428 --> 00:50:49,539
seeing their mummies or daddies in ICU.

737
00:50:49,822 --> 00:50:51,764
Think about that before you take her in.

738
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,419
She wants to see him.

739
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,769
She needs to see him.

740
00:51:06,699 --> 00:51:07,815
Paul?

741
00:51:09,831 --> 00:51:11,997
Your wife and daughter
are here to see you.

742
00:51:39,746 --> 00:51:41,150
Hello, Daddy.

743
00:51:44,496 --> 00:51:46,746
It's me, Daddy. It's me, Olivia.

744
00:51:51,197 --> 00:51:52,160
Sally?

745
00:51:57,073 --> 00:51:58,487
What's happening?

746
00:52:00,528 --> 00:52:02,913
It's all right, Daddy, it's all right.

747
00:52:06,228 --> 00:52:07,538
Why are you so big?

748
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:13,214
And you?

749
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:15,200
You look different.

750
00:52:16,584 --> 00:52:17,600
Older.

751
00:52:19,458 --> 00:52:20,840
What's happening to me?

752
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:46,155
Just be careful of the
tubes in Daddy's arm.

753
00:52:55,895 --> 00:52:57,095
Is it you?

754
00:52:59,689 --> 00:53:01,013
Is it really you?

755
00:53:01,571 --> 00:53:02,801
Yes, Daddy.

756
00:53:11,176 --> 00:53:12,719
I feel that I know you...

757
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:15,960
... that I love you.

758
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:17,960
You do love me, Daddy,

759
00:53:18,182 --> 00:53:19,600
and I love you too.

760
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,430
That's it.

761
00:54:20,004 --> 00:54:22,917
That's the stolen vehicle
with the fake plates.

762
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,720
It's Spector's lock-up.

763
00:54:37,506 --> 00:54:40,085
_

764
00:55:00,608 --> 00:55:01,768
Hello?

765
00:55:03,236 --> 00:55:04,705
Is someone there?

766
00:55:13,693 --> 00:55:15,022
Oh, God.

767
00:55:20,798 --> 00:55:24,064
It seems Spector WAS intending
to feed Rose after all.

768
00:55:28,829 --> 00:55:30,656
Maybe that's what he
was doing in the car

769
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:32,119
on the hillside that night.

770
00:55:34,241 --> 00:55:36,347
Seeing me made him turn back.

771
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,087
And Rose almost died.

772
00:55:47,937 --> 00:55:49,157
Ma'am?

773
00:56:19,912 --> 00:56:21,271
There are images.

774
00:56:23,038 --> 00:56:24,480
Fragments.

775
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,245
Moments of recognition.

776
00:56:29,103 --> 00:56:31,280
I just... can't make sense of anything.

777
00:56:34,829 --> 00:56:36,680
It feels like I've lost my mind.

778
00:56:38,623 --> 00:56:40,346
Just some memories.

779
00:56:45,429 --> 00:56:47,217
She's a lovely wee girl.

780
00:56:50,055 --> 00:56:51,489
You need to sleep.

781
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,522
I'm here if you need anything.

782
00:56:55,229 --> 00:56:56,480
Just sleep now.

783
00:57:34,755 --> 00:57:35,980
Ma'am?

784
00:57:42,467 --> 00:57:43,840
Jesus!

785
00:57:50,249 --> 00:57:51,728
How many are there?

786
00:57:52,972 --> 00:57:54,240
Nine or ten.

787
00:57:59,918 --> 00:58:01,217
More victims?

788
00:58:01,287 --> 00:58:02,736

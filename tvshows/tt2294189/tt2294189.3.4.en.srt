1
00:00:00,973 --> 00:00:02,526
We've seen fragments before,

2
00:00:02,531 --> 00:00:04,587
enough to confirm that
he kept journals, but

3
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:06,520
nothing like this. Are they just

4
00:00:06,534 --> 00:00:09,488
fantasies that sustain
him? Or are they a record

5
00:00:09,529 --> 00:00:11,378
of nine more murders?

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,052
The police say they have a confession,

7
00:00:13,085 --> 00:00:14,925
that you made a number of admissions.

8
00:00:15,387 --> 00:00:16,608
I... I don't remember any of that.

9
00:00:16,608 --> 00:00:18,739
- I understand he's conscious.
- Yes,

10
00:00:19,084 --> 00:00:21,057
but there is an issue.

11
00:00:21,073 --> 00:00:24,070
It seems Mr Spector
suffered some memory loss.

12
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,094
Are we supposed to be
taking this seriously?

13
00:00:26,122 --> 00:00:27,284
I think we have to.

14
00:00:27,307 --> 00:00:29,928
- Do you know who that is?
- No.

15
00:00:29,991 --> 00:00:32,242
You will be held on remand in hospital

16
00:00:32,253 --> 00:00:33,909
until arrangements can be made

17
00:00:33,918 --> 00:00:37,405
to transfer you to a
secure psychiatric clinic.

18
00:00:37,525 --> 00:00:38,779
If she told the truth

19
00:00:38,823 --> 00:00:41,103
in the first place, about
Spector's whereabouts,

20
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:43,381
then perhaps Rose Stagg would
not have been put through

21
00:00:43,392 --> 00:00:44,818
the ordeal that she has.

22
00:00:44,938 --> 00:00:46,022
Drink it all up.

23
00:00:47,678 --> 00:00:48,824
Good girl.

24
00:00:48,824 --> 00:00:50,531
Why are you so kind to me?

25
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:53,227
If I've done the things
that the police say I've done

26
00:00:53,255 --> 00:00:54,566
then I'm a monster.

27
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:55,676
It's my job.

28
00:00:55,873 --> 00:00:58,013
He's just the sort of
person who would feign

29
00:00:58,035 --> 00:01:00,643
amnesia if he felt that there was
something to be gained from it,

30
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:04,299
<i>even for the sheer delight of
duping people, particularly experts.</i>

31
00:01:04,419 --> 00:01:06,717
Someone like me, for example.

32
00:01:10,176 --> 00:01:12,048
I found a murder that looks promising.

33
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,889
Law student, Susan Harper.

34
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,724
The only problem is, there
is someone doing time for it.

35
00:01:18,063 --> 00:01:19,320
I'll pray for you.

37
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:12,805
Rise and shine.

38
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:22,772
Time to get up.

39
00:03:26,797 --> 00:03:28,509
Stella, for star.

40
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,043
Five more minutes, Daddy, please.

41
00:05:16,609 --> 00:05:18,813
There are no scratches or nail marks

42
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,014
on the soft parts of the victim's face,

43
00:05:21,014 --> 00:05:22,619
no bruising or

44
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:24,926
lacerations to the mouth or nose

45
00:05:24,947 --> 00:05:27,400
to suggest they were
held closed by a hand.

46
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,957
The original case file
suggests that David Alvarez

47
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,930
suffocated her using a pillow.

48
00:05:33,201 --> 00:05:35,418
There was no saliva,
blood or tissue cells

49
00:05:35,432 --> 00:05:37,004
on any of the pillows, were there?

50
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,487
They could have been washed.

51
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,726
Yes, they could.

52
00:05:43,262 --> 00:05:45,146
Do we have the toxicology report?

53
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:46,618
Page five, Ma'am.

54
00:05:50,107 --> 00:05:51,719
When was the report done?

55
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:54,325
Susan Harper's body was
found cool to the touch

56
00:05:54,332 --> 00:05:55,652
on a Monday morning.

57
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:59,404
Toxicology was 24 hours
later, during autopsy.

58
00:05:59,613 --> 00:06:02,768
Tests 24 hours after
that on the Wednesday.

59
00:06:03,157 --> 00:06:04,414
Based on these figures,

60
00:06:04,438 --> 00:06:07,235
I'd say the victim took
cocaine within hours,

61
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:09,741
minutes, even, from death.

62
00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:13,505
Do we have anything at all to put

63
00:06:13,811 --> 00:06:17,536
Paul Spector or Peter
Baldwin in London in 2002?

64
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:19,546
Nothing as yet, Ma'am.

65
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,320
Was there a plastic
bag found at the scene?

66
00:06:30,838 --> 00:06:32,382
No mention that I've seen.

67
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:40,876
Well, Spector is due to be moved today,

68
00:06:40,876 --> 00:06:43,585
which means the next

69
00:06:44,123 --> 00:06:46,574
part of his assessment
is about to begin.

70
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:51,411
We have to keep believing
that it will go to trial...

71
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,646
... and when it does,
we have to put together

72
00:06:54,652 --> 00:06:57,810
as strong an evidential case
to the PPS as we possibly can.

73
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:01,801
We have to be ready.

74
00:07:03,803 --> 00:07:06,040
The truth of a confession is immaterial.

75
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,644
What is of crucial importance is

76
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,223
how the confession was obtained,

77
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:10,957
not whether or not it's true.

78
00:07:11,513 --> 00:07:13,180
The court must exclude the confession

79
00:07:13,185 --> 00:07:15,097
if it finds it was
obtained by oppression

80
00:07:15,217 --> 00:07:18,211
or under circumstances likely
to render it unreliable.

81
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:19,706
I've read the transcripts.

82
00:07:19,745 --> 00:07:22,674
- I didn't see any signs of oppression.
- I'm not so sure.

83
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,593
The circumstances are certainly unusual.

84
00:07:26,178 --> 00:07:29,217
Why is a Superintendent doing the
job of a Constable or Sergeant,

85
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:30,785
interviewing a suspect?

86
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:33,203
Surely, when you get to
her level, you supervise,

87
00:07:33,207 --> 00:07:35,744
manage and direct the
officers, not do their job?

88
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:37,121
It was at his request,

89
00:07:37,132 --> 00:07:39,578
- "Just you, Stella, no-one else."
- That's my point.

90
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,509
She didn't really use any
standard interview techniques.

91
00:07:44,042 --> 00:07:46,321
She didn't offer psychological excuses

92
00:07:46,344 --> 00:07:49,154
or minimise the seriousness
of Spector's crimes.

93
00:07:49,274 --> 00:07:50,946
She didn't praise or flatter.

94
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:52,893
She even used leading questions

95
00:07:52,898 --> 00:07:55,094
that elicited one-word answers.

96
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,994
Almost not like a
police interview at all,

97
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,519
more like an intimate conversation.

98
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,498
She didn't need to establish a rapport,

99
00:08:03,731 --> 00:08:06,101
because their relationship
had already been established

100
00:08:06,117 --> 00:08:07,212
on the phone.

101
00:08:07,332 --> 00:08:08,909
While they were still hunting him,

102
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:11,797
it's claimed Spector and Gibson
had private conversations.

103
00:08:12,437 --> 00:08:14,834
She gave him her personal phone number.

104
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:19,202
They even suggest he
was in her hotel room.

105
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:22,410
Why would he do something so risky

106
00:08:22,421 --> 00:08:24,105
just to leave an entry in her diary?

107
00:08:24,294 --> 00:08:26,262
It speaks of a kind of obsession.

108
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:30,826
<i>Stella?</i>

109
00:08:33,695 --> 00:08:34,984
<i>Yes.</i>

110
00:08:36,178 --> 00:08:38,485
<i>How nice to hear your voice again.</i>

111
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:42,070
<i>Is that you, Peter?</i>

112
00:08:42,993 --> 00:08:44,010
<i>Yes.</i>

113
00:08:45,372 --> 00:08:46,917
<i>Why are you calling me?</i>

114
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,059
<i>Because I'm looking up at the sky.</i>

115
00:08:52,276 --> 00:08:53,389
<i>Stella.</i>

116
00:08:53,605 --> 00:08:55,350
Shining star.

117
00:08:57,335 --> 00:08:58,818
<i>It's a beautiful night.</i>

118
00:08:59,224 --> 00:09:00,853
<i>Made me think of you.</i>

119
00:09:02,737 --> 00:09:04,955
Do we have that diary, that entry?

120
00:09:04,966 --> 00:09:06,806
It hasn't been disclosed so far.

121
00:09:06,989 --> 00:09:08,274
Get it.

122
00:09:09,197 --> 00:09:10,526
So...

123
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:14,836
- ... she seduced a confession from him?
- Maybe.

124
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,099
If you can support
what you're suggesting

125
00:09:17,115 --> 00:09:18,822
with case law, legal principals,

126
00:09:19,446 --> 00:09:21,107
I might include it in the brief.

127
00:09:43,763 --> 00:09:46,503
These are all of the books
from Spector's lock-up, Ma'am.

128
00:10:37,813 --> 00:10:39,020
Ma'am,

129
00:10:39,198 --> 00:10:40,816
there's something you should see.

130
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:46,347
The wife of the man the police
claim is The Belfast Strangler

131
00:10:46,408 --> 00:10:49,643
was involved in a bizarre
incident earlier this morning,

132
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:53,011
<i>captured on video by a
passer-by as it unfolded.</i>

133
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:56,275
Images that some viewers
may find disturbing.

134
00:10:57,113 --> 00:10:58,835
<i>Oh, my God, that's a car. </i>

135
00:10:58,863 --> 00:11:01,110
<i>- Hey, hey!
- Michael, be careful!</i>

136
00:11:03,256 --> 00:11:06,010
Hey, hey!

137
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:07,497
Oh, my God.

138
00:11:08,097 --> 00:11:10,807
The car being engulfed
by the incoming tide

139
00:11:10,877 --> 00:11:13,945
belongs to Sally-Ann Spector, 32.

140
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:16,636
The windows are raised,
the doors are locked.

141
00:11:16,874 --> 00:11:18,933
Inside are her two children.

142
00:11:18,935 --> 00:11:20,720
<i>- Oh, my God!
- The girl, aged eight,</i>

143
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:22,422
can be heard calling for help.

144
00:11:22,978 --> 00:11:25,031
- <i>Help us, please, help!
- </i>The lock.

145
00:11:25,196 --> 00:11:27,487
- Hey, hey!
- I can't wake up Liam!

146
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:29,839
<i>Please, get it open!</i>

147
00:11:30,485 --> 00:11:32,000
<i>Michael!</i>

148
00:11:32,004 --> 00:11:33,519
Mummy!

149
00:11:34,925 --> 00:11:37,493
At last, it seems the doors are unlocked

150
00:11:37,528 --> 00:11:41,202
and the two children are lifted
clear and carried to safety.

151
00:11:41,885 --> 00:11:43,960
In the background, Sally-Ann Spector

152
00:11:43,988 --> 00:11:45,756
can be seen walking unsteadily

153
00:11:45,762 --> 00:11:47,835
away from the car through the shallows.

154
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:49,982
<i>Over here. </i>

155
00:11:50,748 --> 00:11:52,283
<i>Are you all right? </i>

156
00:11:52,305 --> 00:11:53,320
<i>She's so cold.</i>

157
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:57,352
A moment later, the car
is almost washed away.

158
00:11:57,357 --> 00:11:58,542
<i>Somebody help that woman!</i>

159
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:06,162
The family was airlifted
by police helicopter

160
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,212
to the Belfast General Hospital,

161
00:12:08,257 --> 00:12:11,259
where Paul Spector is being
treated for gunshot wounds

162
00:12:11,293 --> 00:12:13,479
he sustained in Police cust...

163
00:12:17,554 --> 00:12:19,812
How were we to know
she was that desperate?

164
00:12:25,342 --> 00:12:27,883
It's what women do
with their anger, Jim.

165
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,645
They harm themselves

166
00:12:31,262 --> 00:12:33,675
or extensions of
themselves, their children.

167
00:12:37,827 --> 00:12:39,434
What frame of mind must she have been in

168
00:12:39,451 --> 00:12:41,880
to think that they were
all better off dead?

169
00:12:43,558 --> 00:12:46,071
Instead of caring for her,

170
00:12:46,237 --> 00:12:48,273
supporting her, all we could do

171
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:50,035
was drag her through the courts and

172
00:12:50,445 --> 00:12:51,952
threaten her with prison.

173
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,642
It wasn't just down to me.

174
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:57,472
The DPP was of a similar mind.

175
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,045
Yeah.

176
00:13:01,102 --> 00:13:02,692
Well, now you can add attempted murder

177
00:13:02,692 --> 00:13:04,325
to her list of charges.

178
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,797
All I ever wanted to do

179
00:13:10,815 --> 00:13:13,487
was keep those children
safe, Stella, that's all!

180
00:13:20,797 --> 00:13:21,892
Healy.

181
00:13:23,918 --> 00:13:25,110
Right,

182
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:27,223
thanks for letting me know.

183
00:13:27,485 --> 00:13:29,531
Spector's wife and children
have been taken to the General.

184
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,136
- Why?
- It's been on the news.

185
00:13:31,164 --> 00:13:32,915
See if you can find it on your phone.

186
00:14:35,772 --> 00:14:38,692
Point of care testing found
benzos in the girl's urine.

187
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,448
We haven't managed a
sample from the other two.

188
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:44,017
The son, Liam, is GCS. 12, 13.

189
00:14:44,137 --> 00:14:46,146
With stimulation, he's rousable.

190
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,330
Check the summary care record.

191
00:14:56,601 --> 00:14:58,403
I see she's on the blues.

192
00:14:58,937 --> 00:15:01,171
Severe anxiety and insomnia.

193
00:15:01,232 --> 00:15:04,306
Five milligrams TDS,
titrating to a maximum of ten,

194
00:15:04,646 --> 00:15:06,130
review after two weeks.

195
00:15:06,163 --> 00:15:08,142
So the mother fed the
kids the anxiolytics

196
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:09,654
and then drove them to the sea.

197
00:15:10,093 --> 00:15:11,432
Looks like it.

198
00:15:11,927 --> 00:15:13,451
She's unresponsive,

199
00:15:13,571 --> 00:15:14,891
not saying anything.

200
00:15:26,313 --> 00:15:28,081
Pupils are mid-sized and reactive.

201
00:15:28,092 --> 00:15:30,365
- How's his blood glucose?
- Normal.

202
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:32,127
He might need Flumazenil.

203
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:35,467
Let's put him into paediatric
ICU to keep an eye on him.

204
00:15:56,441 --> 00:15:58,791
Right now, she's
conscious but not talking.

205
00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:01,693
I don't think she's fit
for psych evaluation yet.

206
00:16:02,249 --> 00:16:05,100
We're moving the boy up to the kids ICU.

207
00:16:05,105 --> 00:16:07,585
The girl is awake, she seems OK.

208
00:16:08,813 --> 00:16:10,768
Have you seen the newsreel footage?

209
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:12,014
No.

210
00:16:12,042 --> 00:16:13,599
It looks like a deliberate attempt

211
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,323
to kill herself and her children.

212
00:16:16,723 --> 00:16:18,103
A cry for help?

213
00:16:19,341 --> 00:16:20,636
Maybe.

214
00:16:22,423 --> 00:16:24,535
- Can I say hello?
- Sure.

215
00:16:33,286 --> 00:16:34,707
Hello, Olivia.

216
00:16:36,853 --> 00:16:38,143
Do you remember me?

217
00:16:42,111 --> 00:16:43,545
How are you feeling?

218
00:17:04,892 --> 00:17:08,067
The bullet fragments in Mr
Spector's body contained no iron,

219
00:17:08,187 --> 00:17:10,016
so he had the MRI scan this morning.

220
00:17:13,114 --> 00:17:16,711
There's an absence of evidence
for established infarct...

221
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:21,697
... but a suggestion here

222
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:24,844
of a loss of grey white
matter differentiation.

223
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:27,424
Now that may be in keeping
with ischaemic insult

224
00:17:27,424 --> 00:17:29,663
in the frontal temporal lobe region,

225
00:17:30,426 --> 00:17:33,522
but I can't say it
explains the memory loss.

226
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:37,513
I'll pass the results on to Dr Larson

227
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:39,001
and he can include
them in his assessment.

228
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:40,876
Do we know what happened
to his wife and children?

229
00:17:40,937 --> 00:17:43,477
- How are they?
- No serious injury, I think,

230
00:17:43,597 --> 00:17:46,229
but I'm awaiting a call
from the ED Consultant.

231
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:49,375
- Has Mr Spector been informed?
- Not yet.

232
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:51,492
I'm going to wait for
further information.

233
00:18:04,006 --> 00:18:06,669
I think we have to make a
holding statement of some sort.

234
00:18:06,847 --> 00:18:08,037
Definitely.

235
00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:10,955
Everyone will have seen it by now.

236
00:18:12,423 --> 00:18:13,541
Let's...

237
00:18:14,285 --> 00:18:16,366
confirm that an incident happened,

238
00:18:16,366 --> 00:18:18,471
identify the individuals involved.

239
00:18:20,473 --> 00:18:22,157
Oh, there's nothing else,

240
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,825
no speculation about motivation.

241
00:18:25,047 --> 00:18:27,064
The press will do that for us.

242
00:18:27,126 --> 00:18:28,389
Yeah.

243
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:32,433
Will you handle this, please, Matt?

244
00:18:34,057 --> 00:18:36,833
I'll sit down with DCI
Eastwood and work something out.

245
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:39,561
Sound a warning to the press.

246
00:18:40,723 --> 00:18:42,101
And, Matt...

247
00:18:44,575 --> 00:18:46,142
Show a human face.

248
00:19:03,499 --> 00:19:05,633
<i>Paul, the police claim your</i>

249
00:19:05,639 --> 00:19:08,011
fingerprints are on a
pair of decorating shears.

250
00:19:08,536 --> 00:19:11,392
They say the shears, the scissors,

251
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:14,726
tested positive for Joe
Brawley's DNA, a blood sample.

252
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,312
They were retrieved from the water...

253
00:19:17,738 --> 00:19:18,875
here.

254
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,952
I know where that is,

255
00:19:23,073 --> 00:19:24,597
I go running there sometimes.

256
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:26,894
Is it possible you
came across the scissors

257
00:19:26,928 --> 00:19:29,439
while you were running,
considered them dangerous,

258
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:30,902
picked them up and

259
00:19:31,197 --> 00:19:33,420
threw them into the
water, out of harm's way?

260
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:36,785
I don't remember any scissors.

261
00:19:38,868 --> 00:19:42,154
The one real eye witness is
his sister, Annie Brawley.

262
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,737
After the attack and
before you were arrested

263
00:19:44,738 --> 00:19:46,442
you went to see her in hospital.

264
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,418
I did? Why?

265
00:19:48,538 --> 00:19:50,569
She was grieving the
death of her brother.

266
00:19:51,236 --> 00:19:53,088
You were employed by
the Alice Monroe Fund

267
00:19:53,088 --> 00:19:55,172
to offer her support, counselling.

268
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,696
- What happened?
- Nothing.

269
00:19:57,918 --> 00:19:59,163
You talked.

270
00:19:59,185 --> 00:20:00,709
She said you were helpful.

271
00:20:06,017 --> 00:20:07,391
Hold on. I'm, er,

272
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,225
sorry, I'm very confused here.

273
00:20:10,897 --> 00:20:13,311
This is someone the
police say that I attacked?

274
00:20:13,372 --> 00:20:14,528
Yes.

275
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,595
Well, why didn't she recognise me?

276
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,458
I don't know.

277
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:23,706
Why would I go and visit
someone that I'd attacked?

278
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:27,103
What if she recognised me,
what if she started screaming?

279
00:20:30,598 --> 00:20:32,083
It doesn't make sense.

280
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:03,036
You do have alibis
for all of the murders.

281
00:21:03,431 --> 00:21:05,236
They have been provided by an individual

282
00:21:05,258 --> 00:21:07,120
called Katie Benedetto.

283
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:11,224
She claims she had a sexual
relationship with you.

284
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,599
I don't know her. What age is she?

285
00:21:17,762 --> 00:21:19,680
She's just turned 16.

286
00:21:19,924 --> 00:21:22,687
She says she was 14 when
you first slept together.

287
00:21:23,021 --> 00:21:24,534
That's not possible.

288
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:27,362
A child? That's not possible.

289
00:21:27,395 --> 00:21:30,259
There are doubts about her
credibility as a witness.

290
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:34,216
The real issue, Mr
Spector, is the confession.

291
00:21:35,073 --> 00:21:36,657
I think you should hear a little

292
00:21:36,702 --> 00:21:38,675
of the recording that was made.

293
00:21:38,936 --> 00:21:40,921
It might jog your memory.

294
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,653
<i>Tell me about the first time.</i>

295
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,700
<i>What was it like?</i>

296
00:21:56,134 --> 00:21:57,831
<i>It made me sick.</i>

297
00:22:00,617 --> 00:22:02,318
<i>The smell disgusted me.</i>

298
00:22:04,435 --> 00:22:07,631
<i>The first was the worst
and hardest to get over,</i>

299
00:22:07,751 --> 00:22:09,481
<i>but a switch had been flicked,</i>

300
00:22:10,232 --> 00:22:12,022
<i>a line crossed.</i>

301
00:22:12,912 --> 00:22:15,541
<i>Something was done that
couldn't be undone.</i>

302
00:22:16,714 --> 00:22:19,789
<i>Something that separates
you from the common herd.</i>

303
00:22:21,706 --> 00:22:23,956
<i>I was ill for four days after.</i>

304
00:22:25,835 --> 00:22:28,481
<i>You're in a state of
existential shock... </i>

305
00:22:30,647 --> 00:22:32,589
<i>... but then you find
yourself unchallenged</i>

306
00:22:32,595 --> 00:22:34,779
<i>by divine and secular power.</i>

307
00:22:35,296 --> 00:22:36,703
<i>OK.</i>

308
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:39,309
<i>So why not do it again... </i>

309
00:22:40,227 --> 00:22:41,467
<i>... but better?</i>

310
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,353
<i>Tell me, do you speak to them?</i>

311
00:22:45,876 --> 00:22:48,049
<i>To the women that you torture and kill?</i>

312
00:22:50,584 --> 00:22:51,679
<i>No.</i>

313
00:22:53,352 --> 00:22:55,090
<i>Do they die slowly?</i>

314
00:22:57,527 --> 00:22:58,889
<i>Yes.</i>

315
00:22:59,568 --> 00:23:02,347
<i>Loosening and tightening your
grip around their throat?</i>

316
00:23:03,487 --> 00:23:06,288
<i>Keeping them suspended
between life and death?</i>

317
00:23:07,645 --> 00:23:09,001
<i>Yes.</i>

318
00:23:10,164 --> 00:23:11,839
<i>Binding them first?</i>

319
00:23:12,647 --> 00:23:14,043
<i>Yes.</i>

320
00:23:14,871 --> 00:23:16,848
<i>How long do you torture them?</i>

321
00:23:17,735 --> 00:23:20,294
- <i>Stop it. Please, stop it.
- </i>Do you inflict sexual acts...

322
00:23:24,011 --> 00:23:25,727
That can't be me talking.

323
00:23:26,547 --> 00:23:29,269
How would I forget something
like that? That can't be me.

324
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:33,509
There are other recordings, Mr Spector.

325
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,416
These are video recordings.

326
00:23:36,846 --> 00:23:39,947
The prosecution suggest that...

327
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,282
they were found on your phone.

328
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:44,316
That you made them.

329
00:23:44,761 --> 00:23:47,046
- That's Rose.
- Yes.

330
00:23:50,785 --> 00:23:52,625
You want to be noticed.

331
00:23:54,639 --> 00:23:56,786
You want to be paid attention to,

332
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,378
make your mark?

333
00:24:00,302 --> 00:24:02,386
Fine. Hurt me,

334
00:24:02,894 --> 00:24:04,804
do whatever you want to me.

335
00:24:05,701 --> 00:24:07,111
Do your worst.

336
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,848
Nothing you can do

337
00:24:08,869 --> 00:24:12,156
will ever take away how
much I love my husband,

338
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:15,268
how much I love my children.

339
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:18,270
Nothing you can do

340
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,507
can make me devalue my life in any way.

341
00:24:20,514 --> 00:24:22,181
I will celebrate life.

342
00:24:22,441 --> 00:24:24,752
I love and I am loved

343
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,704
and nothing that you...

344
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:33,982
<i>Why the fuck are you watching this?</i>

345
00:24:35,091 --> 00:24:37,010
<i>You sick shit.</i>

346
00:24:38,142 --> 00:24:40,153
<i>What the fuck is wrong with you?</i>

347
00:24:48,523 --> 00:24:49,725
Nurse!

348
00:24:51,671 --> 00:24:53,026
Nurse!

349
00:24:54,256 --> 00:24:57,382
Paul, Paul, stop that. Can
you step outside, please?

350
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,112
Paul, that's enough,

351
00:24:59,174 --> 00:25:00,628
Paul, focus on your breathing,

352
00:25:00,648 --> 00:25:03,031
focus on your breath.
Come on, that's enough.

353
00:25:03,087 --> 00:25:04,496
Just in and out.

354
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:06,581
Slow breathing, you're OK, Paul.

355
00:25:06,702 --> 00:25:08,625
In and out, big, deep breath.

356
00:25:08,876 --> 00:25:13,162
Yeah that's good, that's it, you're OK.

357
00:25:29,036 --> 00:25:31,290
Jesus, what have we got ourselves into?

358
00:25:31,293 --> 00:25:33,209
- You having doubts?
- No.

359
00:25:33,225 --> 00:25:34,647
- You sure?
- Yes.

360
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:36,328
Because if you are, you
can pack up your briefcase

361
00:25:36,342 --> 00:25:38,205
- and sell houses instead.
- I'm not.

362
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:40,482
Are you Sean Healy?

363
00:25:40,698 --> 00:25:41,705
Yes.

364
00:25:42,238 --> 00:25:43,510
Will you give this to Paul for me?

365
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,471
Katie?

366
00:25:44,591 --> 00:25:45,836
Please, just give this to Paul.

367
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:47,628
Katie, you're in breach
of your bail conditions.

368
00:25:47,642 --> 00:25:48,913
You're in serious trouble.

369
00:25:49,077 --> 00:25:50,563
We can't take that letter from you.

370
00:25:58,158 --> 00:25:59,448
Katie, stop!

371
00:26:01,244 --> 00:26:02,320
Katie!

372
00:26:02,863 --> 00:26:05,833
I can confirm that there
has been a serious incident

373
00:26:05,846 --> 00:26:08,033
involving the wife and the two children

374
00:26:08,056 --> 00:26:09,781
of the defendant, Paul Spector.

375
00:26:09,826 --> 00:26:11,693
All three are currently being treated

376
00:26:11,707 --> 00:26:13,169
in the Belfast General Hospital.

377
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:14,824
Their injuries are not life-threatening.

378
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:17,438
In light of the torrent of publicity

379
00:26:17,474 --> 00:26:19,605
since Paul Spector was
arrested and charged,

380
00:26:19,773 --> 00:26:21,201
the Police Service Northern Ireland

381
00:26:21,232 --> 00:26:24,413
feel bound to urge the
media to exercise restraint

382
00:26:24,493 --> 00:26:28,228
and caution in reporting
the details of this case.

383
00:26:49,637 --> 00:26:50,674
Yep.

384
00:26:50,941 --> 00:26:53,925
We've had a request to
disclose your dream diary.

385
00:26:54,716 --> 00:26:57,274
Sean Healy wants his
own handwriting expert

386
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:59,336
to examine the entry Spector made.

387
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:03,863
He's in hospital,

388
00:27:04,924 --> 00:27:06,487
he's incapacitated...

389
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:09,381
... and yet he's still
infecting the lives

390
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:11,579
of every person he
comes into contact with.

391
00:27:13,942 --> 00:27:17,228
Everyone who fucking crosses his path.

392
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:25,079
He's a contagion.

393
00:27:29,927 --> 00:27:32,030
Shall I just let them see that page?

394
00:27:37,246 --> 00:27:39,799
They'll just come back
asking for the rest.

395
00:27:43,631 --> 00:27:44,691
No.

396
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,745
Clear it with the PPS.

397
00:27:48,888 --> 00:27:50,973
And if they agree, send all of it.

398
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,364
<i>I can't believe that
she would harm Livvy.</i>

399
00:28:00,561 --> 00:28:02,224
I just don't think she could do that.

400
00:28:05,969 --> 00:28:07,374
I can picture Sally,

401
00:28:08,668 --> 00:28:09,700
nursing her.

402
00:28:10,461 --> 00:28:11,355
Just...

403
00:28:11,985 --> 00:28:13,764
Just so blissfully happy.

404
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:18,173
She'd never hurt her.

405
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,454
Where are you in that picture?

406
00:28:23,682 --> 00:28:24,998
Where I always am.

407
00:28:27,003 --> 00:28:28,790
On the outside, looking in.

408
00:28:32,105 --> 00:28:33,468
When I was unconscious,

409
00:28:34,825 --> 00:28:35,799
I was...

410
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,508
I... I could see myself.

411
00:28:41,327 --> 00:28:42,995
In this room. I was able to

412
00:28:43,761 --> 00:28:45,402
see myself from above,

413
00:28:45,522 --> 00:28:46,810
lying in the bed,

414
00:28:47,633 --> 00:28:49,394
with all the tubes and monitors.

415
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:53,779
Have you ever experienced
anything like that before?

416
00:28:54,825 --> 00:28:56,759
Being outside of your body like that?

417
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,767
When I was young, yes.

418
00:29:02,889 --> 00:29:04,628
When things got really bad, I

419
00:29:05,985 --> 00:29:08,207
used to be able to split myself.

420
00:29:10,506 --> 00:29:11,601
If I was lucky,

421
00:29:11,637 --> 00:29:13,273
a part of me would just drift away.

422
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:16,849
To another place, a...

423
00:29:17,662 --> 00:29:18,859
better place.

424
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,866
Have you thought any more
about what death means to you?

425
00:29:27,811 --> 00:29:29,824
What I think can only disappoint you.

426
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:32,342
That doesn't matter.

427
00:29:38,096 --> 00:29:39,612
I think that,

428
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,876
just as I didn't

429
00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:43,788
exist before I was born...

430
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,733
... I simply won't exist after I die.

431
00:29:50,044 --> 00:29:51,437
I can't agree.

432
00:30:00,678 --> 00:30:01,718
Do you believe

433
00:30:01,731 --> 00:30:03,946
that you did the
things they say you did?

434
00:30:06,516 --> 00:30:07,735
Do you?

435
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:14,943
If I did, then I wasn't arrested...

436
00:30:16,811 --> 00:30:18,219
... I was rescued.

437
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:25,754
I need you to go to London.

438
00:30:26,585 --> 00:30:29,146
My boss at the Met, a
man called Chris George,

439
00:30:29,448 --> 00:30:31,018
Chief Superintendent.

440
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,156
I just spoke to him.

441
00:30:33,406 --> 00:30:35,634
He's agreed to sign the
authorisations you will need

442
00:30:35,643 --> 00:30:37,658
to access the Susan Harper files.

443
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:39,546
He's agreed to reopen the case?

444
00:30:39,792 --> 00:30:42,381
He's agreed to let us look at the files.

445
00:30:42,736 --> 00:30:44,226
There's a flight leaving Belfast City

446
00:30:44,226 --> 00:30:45,569
in just over an hour.

447
00:30:50,795 --> 00:30:52,386
Will your arm be all right?

448
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:56,242
Yeah.

449
00:30:59,301 --> 00:31:00,408
Take Ferrington.

450
00:31:02,836 --> 00:31:04,362
These notes cover wound care

451
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,767
and list the medications you're on.

452
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,791
You've had four days of
broad intravenous antibiotics,

453
00:31:09,089 --> 00:31:11,806
but I must remind you, because
of the loss of your spleen,

454
00:31:11,841 --> 00:31:14,678
you will be on lifelong
prophylactic antibiotics.

455
00:31:17,786 --> 00:31:19,676
Is there any chance I could see my son

456
00:31:20,854 --> 00:31:21,899
before I go?

457
00:31:36,814 --> 00:31:37,921
Which one is he?

458
00:31:39,011 --> 00:31:40,123
Just there.

459
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,376
Do you remember him?

460
00:32:16,481 --> 00:32:17,985
Do you think he looks like me?

461
00:32:20,616 --> 00:32:22,182
A little bit, maybe.

462
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:26,727
Paul.

463
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,009
I can walk.

464
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:48,801
Hospital policy.

465
00:32:50,856 --> 00:32:52,025
Sit in the chair.

466
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,486
Thank you for everything.

467
00:34:22,972 --> 00:34:24,427
Detective Superintendent Gibson.

468
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,184
I'm here to see Dr Larson.

469
00:34:26,304 --> 00:34:27,457
He's been expecting you.

470
00:34:27,493 --> 00:34:28,842
Please sign in.

471
00:34:33,914 --> 00:34:34,930
Thank you.

472
00:34:39,421 --> 00:34:41,289
Have I seen you somewhere before?

473
00:34:46,662 --> 00:34:48,095
You tell me.

474
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:56,389
This is Foyle One,

475
00:34:56,411 --> 00:34:58,798
where Mr Spector will be housed.

476
00:34:59,154 --> 00:35:00,634
Doors are kept locked,

477
00:35:00,647 --> 00:35:03,412
all areas are monitored by CCTV.

478
00:35:04,921 --> 00:35:07,765
Staff have lockers here
for personal belongings.

479
00:35:08,351 --> 00:35:10,974
You can leave your mobile
phone, any keys here.

480
00:35:14,898 --> 00:35:17,147
What level of supervision
have you set for Spector?

481
00:35:17,502 --> 00:35:20,401
We have agreed to level
two care for Mr Spector:

482
00:35:20,405 --> 00:35:22,347
continual presence of nursing staff,

483
00:35:22,396 --> 00:35:24,313
but privacy granted for bathing.

484
00:35:25,272 --> 00:35:29,278
All patients in Foyle One
are allocated a primary nurse.

485
00:35:29,598 --> 00:35:31,085
- Male?
- Male.

486
00:35:31,835 --> 00:35:33,374
How many beds are on this ward?

487
00:35:33,392 --> 00:35:34,776
12 in all.

488
00:35:35,721 --> 00:35:38,675
All the patients we have
on the ward at present have

489
00:35:38,698 --> 00:35:41,099
access to their rooms at all times,

490
00:35:41,117 --> 00:35:42,869
except when they're being cleaned.

491
00:35:43,361 --> 00:35:44,736
Some patients have keys

492
00:35:44,737 --> 00:35:46,237
to lock their bedroom doors,

493
00:35:46,238 --> 00:35:48,655
but staff carry override keys.

494
00:35:49,821 --> 00:35:51,033
This way, please.

495
00:35:56,012 --> 00:35:58,155
Most of the patients are on

496
00:35:58,173 --> 00:36:00,046
pharmacological therapy.

497
00:36:00,579 --> 00:36:04,119
We'll assess the need for a
drug strategy for Mr Spector.

498
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:06,201
Care and treatment is provided

499
00:36:06,236 --> 00:36:07,981
by a multidisciplinary team,

500
00:36:08,349 --> 00:36:10,997
but I will do the legal assessments.

501
00:36:12,684 --> 00:36:14,530
Yeah, Mr Spector is here now.

502
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,963
- There's coffee here, please help yourself.
- Thank you.

503
00:36:18,084 --> 00:36:19,646
I'm going to greet him.

504
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,727
Mr Spector,

505
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,905
I'm August Larson,

506
00:37:14,526 --> 00:37:16,128
the lead clinician here.

507
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,762
Follow me, please.

508
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:49,212
Nurse Ritchie will orientate you.

509
00:37:50,327 --> 00:37:53,082
I will be along to talk
to you in a little while.

510
00:37:54,121 --> 00:37:55,623
Follow me, Paul.

511
00:38:10,341 --> 00:38:12,448
There's some toiletries for you there.

512
00:38:12,476 --> 00:38:15,409
And that's your information
on ward routines,

513
00:38:15,437 --> 00:38:17,281
policies and procedures.

514
00:38:22,322 --> 00:38:23,491
Are you hungry?

515
00:38:24,765 --> 00:38:26,371
I haven't been eating much.

516
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,515
I'd like some water.

517
00:38:28,998 --> 00:38:30,169
I'll get you some.

518
00:38:47,953 --> 00:38:49,535
Do you have time to talk?

519
00:38:49,596 --> 00:38:50,776
Yes.

520
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:52,199
Have a seat, please.

521
00:38:53,178 --> 00:38:54,719
Actually I...

522
00:38:56,424 --> 00:38:58,697
- I have some things I want to show you.
- Hmm?

523
00:39:26,638 --> 00:39:29,224
And you're certain these are his work?

524
00:39:30,256 --> 00:39:31,526
Yes.

525
00:39:39,996 --> 00:39:41,459
Is this his poem?

526
00:39:42,187 --> 00:39:43,525
I think so.

527
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:47,776
"Dark voices tonight...

528
00:39:48,789 --> 00:39:51,615
... foreign ladies
talking to dangerous men.

529
00:39:52,467 --> 00:39:54,933
Their eyes are lunar divisions.

530
00:39:55,755 --> 00:39:57,532
They lie on dead sheets.

531
00:39:58,856 --> 00:40:01,446
A drunken midnight approach.

532
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:05,633
Her smile is a crooked lamplight.

533
00:40:06,416 --> 00:40:08,207
Red lips parting...

534
00:40:09,611 --> 00:40:12,434
... soft vowels begging...

535
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,596
feeding the night."

536
00:40:20,681 --> 00:40:22,484
Some clean clothes for you.

537
00:40:37,872 --> 00:40:39,394
Is this his, too?

538
00:40:40,495 --> 00:40:42,230
"I don't believe in love.

539
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:46,441
At least, I believe in love, but not

540
00:40:46,562 --> 00:40:48,078
in happiness.

541
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:51,241
The only love that lasts

542
00:40:51,562 --> 00:40:53,443
is unhappy love."

543
00:40:53,564 --> 00:40:55,883
Again, I think it must be him.

544
00:40:57,287 --> 00:41:00,126
I haven't found either
on an internet search.

545
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,530
There are some things in
there that are new to me.

546
00:41:05,878 --> 00:41:08,158
He writes at one point about

547
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,331
the battle, as he perceives it,

548
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,256
between "good Paul" and "bad Paul".

549
00:41:14,154 --> 00:41:15,546
He describes

550
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:19,661
standing back, being a
spectator of his own actions,

551
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,648
that there's an observing
self and a participating self.

552
00:41:33,017 --> 00:41:36,202
There is a dazzling
array of perversions.

553
00:41:37,311 --> 00:41:39,840
I mean, beyond the sadism and the

554
00:41:40,268 --> 00:41:44,133
overwhelming fetishism
with female underwear.

555
00:41:44,572 --> 00:41:46,319
He was a voyeur,

556
00:41:46,525 --> 00:41:48,372
a transvestite...

557
00:41:48,821 --> 00:41:51,728
into autoeroticism and necrophilia.

558
00:41:52,088 --> 00:41:53,986
There's also signs of

559
00:41:53,992 --> 00:41:57,591
pygmalionism, his obsession
with mannequins and dolls.

560
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,113
I've sometimes wondered if he

561
00:42:01,884 --> 00:42:03,464
breathed air

562
00:42:03,703 --> 00:42:06,636
into his dying victims
to prolong their lives...

563
00:42:07,612 --> 00:42:11,373
... so that they could see clearly
that he was going to kill them.

564
00:42:20,259 --> 00:42:23,099
When young children are abused,

565
00:42:23,716 --> 00:42:26,665
they experience fear and anxiety.

566
00:42:27,004 --> 00:42:30,276
They then attempt to
contain those feelings

567
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:32,628
by acting out sadistically.

568
00:42:33,238 --> 00:42:35,624
If a person is able to do to others

569
00:42:35,635 --> 00:42:37,587
what he fears may be done to him,

570
00:42:38,065 --> 00:42:39,988
he may no longer be afraid.

571
00:42:42,422 --> 00:42:44,266
You assume he was abused?

572
00:42:46,158 --> 00:42:48,121
He was in Gortnacull, I think?

573
00:42:49,419 --> 00:42:52,198
Doctor, I understand that

574
00:42:52,243 --> 00:42:54,128
for you he's a patient,

575
00:42:54,156 --> 00:42:55,560
an abused child,

576
00:42:56,114 --> 00:42:59,464
someone who deserves understanding and

577
00:42:59,525 --> 00:43:01,017
compassion, even.

578
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:04,959
But to me, he's a...

579
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,874
He's a sexual predator,

580
00:43:07,572 --> 00:43:10,656
and it's my job to protect
the potential victims

581
00:43:11,144 --> 00:43:13,235
from the threat that he poses.

582
00:43:19,959 --> 00:43:23,315
Viewed from a psychodynamic perspective,

583
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,592
even the most apparently insane violence

584
00:43:26,803 --> 00:43:29,837
has meaning in the mind of
the person who commits it.

585
00:43:30,736 --> 00:43:33,221
I have to try to understand that meaning

586
00:43:33,221 --> 00:43:34,707
and learn from it

587
00:43:34,828 --> 00:43:38,412
in the attempt to
prevent further violence.

588
00:43:39,006 --> 00:43:40,343
Yeah.

589
00:43:42,258 --> 00:43:43,466
Just...

590
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:45,755
don't underestimate the threat...

591
00:43:46,734 --> 00:43:49,396
... the danger that
Paul Spector represents.

592
00:43:49,516 --> 00:43:51,065
I won't.

593
00:44:02,059 --> 00:44:03,513
Do you have an idea

594
00:44:03,529 --> 00:44:05,918
about Mr Spector's pre-morbid IQ?

595
00:44:06,663 --> 00:44:08,798
He was tested as a child

596
00:44:09,403 --> 00:44:12,580
and scored in the very
superior intelligence band.

597
00:44:14,149 --> 00:44:15,359
Thank you.

598
00:44:15,731 --> 00:44:17,610
It's been a pleasure talking to you.

599
00:44:30,091 --> 00:44:33,751
Psychiatry needs feedback from patients.

600
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:36,670
It's realised in interpersonal contacts,

601
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:38,909
so trust is essential.

602
00:44:39,436 --> 00:44:41,372
It is not my place to judge him

603
00:44:41,407 --> 00:44:43,582
for what he may or may not have done,

604
00:44:43,753 --> 00:44:46,564
but I will try to get to
the truth of the matter

605
00:44:46,864 --> 00:44:49,008
for the courts and for you.

606
00:44:50,528 --> 00:44:52,078
He is going to prison.

607
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:55,405
Let me show you out.

608
00:44:58,803 --> 00:45:01,163
All right, boys.

609
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:02,963
Out you come.

610
00:45:10,283 --> 00:45:12,279
You should try to eat
some fruit at least.

611
00:46:22,929 --> 00:46:24,748
Rose Stagg is waiting for you, Ma'am.

612
00:46:24,759 --> 00:46:26,502
- Oh, right.
- She's in the interview room.

613
00:46:26,545 --> 00:46:28,945
What's... What's happening
with the Benedetto girl?

614
00:46:28,966 --> 00:46:31,586
She's in custody, due
in court again tomorrow.

615
00:46:32,757 --> 00:46:34,786
- Will you sit in with us, Gail?
- Yes, Ma'am.

616
00:46:38,831 --> 00:46:40,994
<i>What's the next thing that you remember?</i>

617
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,198
Darkness.

618
00:46:45,325 --> 00:46:46,647
And movement,

619
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:48,680
being thrown around.

620
00:46:51,368 --> 00:46:54,066
I think he must have drugged
me when he gave me water.

621
00:46:57,953 --> 00:47:00,749
It took me a while to work
out what was happening...

622
00:47:01,671 --> 00:47:03,159
that I was in the car,

623
00:47:03,726 --> 00:47:05,163
in the boot of a car.

624
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:08,532
It was terrifying.

625
00:47:08,834 --> 00:47:10,601
I was thrown around horribly,

626
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:12,232
particularly towards the end.

627
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,354
I felt like a rag doll.

628
00:47:15,406 --> 00:47:17,479
Every bump made me cry out.

629
00:47:19,984 --> 00:47:21,534
Then the car stopped,

630
00:47:22,555 --> 00:47:24,192
the engine was turned off.

631
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:28,541
The driver's door opened...

632
00:47:31,563 --> 00:47:33,052
... and then silence.

633
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,233
I waited and waited...

634
00:47:38,441 --> 00:47:39,930
but nothing happened.

635
00:47:43,072 --> 00:47:45,367
I realised I'd been left there alone.

636
00:47:48,016 --> 00:47:51,335
There were some old
water bottles in the boot

637
00:47:51,917 --> 00:47:53,628
so at first I could drink.

638
00:47:55,288 --> 00:47:56,789
But then there was none left.

639
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:01,448
I tried to pull the brake lights out

640
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,250
to let in more air,

641
00:48:03,991 --> 00:48:05,691
but I couldn't shift them.

642
00:48:07,914 --> 00:48:09,282
I felt so weak.

643
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:12,117
There was no air.

644
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,345
I became obsessed

645
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:19,168
with the sound of my own breathing.

646
00:48:20,306 --> 00:48:21,884
I'd fall asleep, but

647
00:48:23,304 --> 00:48:25,089
I'd have no idea for how long.

648
00:48:27,028 --> 00:48:29,185
At first I thought I could tell

649
00:48:29,677 --> 00:48:32,589
whether it was day or night
from the smell of the air,

650
00:48:35,269 --> 00:48:37,722
but then the air got staler and staler.

651
00:48:40,833 --> 00:48:42,933
I lost all track of time.

652
00:48:48,635 --> 00:48:50,624
I tried to think about the kids,

653
00:48:52,576 --> 00:48:54,103
but I couldn't focus.

654
00:48:56,979 --> 00:48:59,415
I felt my brain was shutting down.

655
00:49:03,101 --> 00:49:06,160
The last thing I remember

656
00:49:07,264 --> 00:49:09,364
was thinking that I should burrow,

657
00:49:10,605 --> 00:49:13,827
that I should dig down
into the earth to hide,

658
00:49:14,442 --> 00:49:16,256
to feel safe and warm.

659
00:49:18,004 --> 00:49:19,157
Like an animal,

660
00:49:19,536 --> 00:49:20,578
digging...

661
00:49:27,251 --> 00:49:29,616
I don't remember anything after that.

662
00:49:32,114 --> 00:49:33,295
Thank you.

663
00:49:40,823 --> 00:49:43,256
Can I talk to you...

664
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,794
alone?

665
00:49:46,446 --> 00:49:47,786
Without the tape?

666
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,809
This is DC Gail McNally

667
00:49:53,823 --> 00:49:57,400
suspending the interview at 10.43pm.

668
00:50:14,592 --> 00:50:16,017
I haven't been...

669
00:50:18,994 --> 00:50:21,507
I haven't been completely
honest with you.

670
00:50:22,796 --> 00:50:24,349
I led you to believe

671
00:50:24,371 --> 00:50:26,995
that after that one
time he strangled me,

672
00:50:27,411 --> 00:50:28,785
that it ended.

673
00:50:31,823 --> 00:50:33,172
But it didn't.

674
00:50:35,621 --> 00:50:37,348
I suspected as much.

675
00:50:43,131 --> 00:50:44,738
It wasn't that simple.

676
00:50:46,999 --> 00:50:49,341
We went to some dark places.

677
00:50:51,721 --> 00:50:53,421
The first time it happened,

678
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:55,212
I was giving him...

679
00:50:56,162 --> 00:50:57,245
I was...

680
00:50:57,477 --> 00:50:59,012
using my mouth on him.

681
00:51:01,331 --> 00:51:03,749
He squeezed his legs around my neck.

682
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:07,129
I couldn't breathe. I was...

683
00:51:10,247 --> 00:51:11,606
Take your time.

684
00:51:14,054 --> 00:51:15,474
Er...

685
00:51:22,882 --> 00:51:24,795
He squeezed really tight.

686
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,169
I thought I was going to pass out but

687
00:51:28,289 --> 00:51:29,540
he released me.

688
00:51:34,582 --> 00:51:36,189
He treated it a bit like a game,

689
00:51:36,224 --> 00:51:37,310
at first.

690
00:51:39,915 --> 00:51:41,920
I'd already begun to
think he didn't have

691
00:51:41,929 --> 00:51:44,427
much enthusiasm for
ordinary intercourse...

692
00:51:47,063 --> 00:51:49,326
... but then things got more serious.

693
00:51:53,475 --> 00:51:55,148
He asked me to play dead.

694
00:51:58,135 --> 00:52:00,984
And then there was the
time that I told you about.

695
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:04,946
I think he revived me, mouth to mouth.

696
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:13,008
There were times when he
wanted to use a plastic bag

697
00:52:13,523 --> 00:52:14,561
on me,

698
00:52:15,818 --> 00:52:17,141
on himself.

699
00:52:21,268 --> 00:52:23,421
He said that we all

700
00:52:23,784 --> 00:52:25,213
try to live in the light,

701
00:52:26,135 --> 00:52:28,646
that we all try to build walls around us

702
00:52:28,659 --> 00:52:30,285
to block out the darkness,

703
00:52:30,404 --> 00:52:32,073
the danger that's out there,

704
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:33,931
but it can't be done,

705
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:35,192
it's a lie,

706
00:52:36,266 --> 00:52:39,256
that in reality there
are dark gods out there

707
00:52:40,267 --> 00:52:43,377
and that men could become gods on earth

708
00:52:43,738 --> 00:52:45,713
through a certain kind of sex.

709
00:52:47,381 --> 00:52:48,623
And women?

710
00:52:49,772 --> 00:52:50,917
I think so.

711
00:52:52,226 --> 00:52:53,411
I'm sorry.

712
00:52:54,422 --> 00:52:56,086
I can't really explain it.

713
00:53:00,573 --> 00:53:02,224
Why did you walk away?

714
00:53:06,038 --> 00:53:07,375
It felt to me

715
00:53:07,953 --> 00:53:10,314
that everything that was happening

716
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:12,475
was about pleasing him.

717
00:53:15,514 --> 00:53:17,591
That it wasn't about me at all.

718
00:53:20,795 --> 00:53:22,750
I left him and I went back to Tom.

719
00:53:23,342 --> 00:53:24,983
And what about Spector?

720
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:28,657
He went to London,

721
00:53:28,954 --> 00:53:29,860
I think.

722
00:53:31,843 --> 00:53:33,897
Did you and Spector ever do drugs?

723
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,932
- I think I told you that we drank a lot.
- Hm.

724
00:53:37,101 --> 00:53:38,051
Cocaine?

725
00:53:38,455 --> 00:53:39,289
No,

726
00:53:40,287 --> 00:53:42,359
not with me, but maybe he did back then.

727
00:53:50,499 --> 00:53:53,142
My life with Tom couldn't
be more different.

728
00:53:54,819 --> 00:53:56,088
Things have been difficult

729
00:53:56,106 --> 00:53:57,605
since the birth of Cody.

730
00:53:59,972 --> 00:54:02,414
Actually, since my first Caesarean.

731
00:54:04,998 --> 00:54:06,405
And how are they now?

732
00:54:08,452 --> 00:54:09,892
It's strange.

733
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:13,454
When he talks to me now, I...

734
00:54:15,527 --> 00:54:17,825
don't really listen to
the words that he's saying,

735
00:54:18,829 --> 00:54:20,687
just to the tone of his voice.

736
00:54:22,796 --> 00:54:24,326
From that I can work out

737
00:54:24,348 --> 00:54:26,004
whether he likes me or not,

738
00:54:26,899 --> 00:54:29,248
whether he's emotionally close to me.

739
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:36,943
Right now, he's angry...

740
00:54:40,237 --> 00:54:42,357
... and I don't think
he likes me very much.

741
00:54:45,363 --> 00:54:46,495
Rose,

742
00:54:48,266 --> 00:54:50,458
there's something I need to tell you.

743
00:54:57,782 --> 00:54:58,808
I think that...

744
00:55:00,285 --> 00:55:01,732
I'm the reason that

745
00:55:01,777 --> 00:55:03,748
Paul Spector came after you.

746
00:55:06,741 --> 00:55:07,846
How?

747
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:11,805
I think I...

748
00:55:13,991 --> 00:55:16,912
I think I revealed your
identity as my informant

749
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:19,255
when I used his name, Peter.

750
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:23,799
The name that you gave me when
I spoke to him on the phone.

751
00:55:28,618 --> 00:55:30,046
Using that name,

752
00:55:31,778 --> 00:55:34,918
together with the E-Fit
that we had created,

753
00:55:35,562 --> 00:55:37,694
I think led him straight to you.

754
00:55:39,511 --> 00:55:40,417
I was

755
00:55:41,485 --> 00:55:43,265
trying to convey that...

756
00:55:44,691 --> 00:55:46,393
... well, that we were on to him.

757
00:55:48,341 --> 00:55:51,287
I was trying to scare
him to stop the attacks.

758
00:55:54,881 --> 00:55:57,588
And it worked to the
extent that he ran, but...

759
00:55:59,735 --> 00:56:01,213
but when we didn't do anything,

760
00:56:01,231 --> 00:56:02,703
when we didn't pounce...

761
00:56:05,903 --> 00:56:07,378
he came after you.

762
00:56:14,063 --> 00:56:15,514
I hadn't realised

763
00:56:15,633 --> 00:56:18,021
your relationship was
so meaningful to him.

764
00:56:25,245 --> 00:56:27,393
He said I was the only one.

765
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:33,024
That I was the only girl.

766
00:56:37,628 --> 00:56:38,983
I believe it.

767
00:56:57,686 --> 00:57:00,703
I'm glad I'm not the only
one to have made mistakes.

768
00:57:07,417 --> 00:57:08,801
Thank you.

769
00:57:20,591 --> 00:57:24,665
Go fuck that!
Jesus fucking Christ!

770
00:57:37,483 --> 00:57:38,972
I'm Mark Bailey.

771
00:57:41,018 --> 00:57:42,280
Who are you?

772
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:51,269
I'm told I'm the Belfast Strangler.

773
00:57:54,795 --> 00:57:56,167
Are you?

774
00:57:59,154 --> 00:58:00,416
Maybe.

775
00:58:01,476 --> 00:58:03,444
Right now, I don't remember.

776
00:58:09,789 --> 00:58:11,604
Wasn't well. Better now.

777
00:58:13,251 --> 00:58:15,048
Wasn't well. Better now.

778
00:58:16,175 --> 00:58:17,957
Wasn't well. Better now.

779
00:58:18,305 --> 00:59:18,474

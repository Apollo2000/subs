1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,739
<i>With regard to his memory loss,</i>

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:06,019
<i>he could be feigning,
exaggerating or simply...</i>

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,429
<i>malingering.</i>

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,759
Now, I feel I have no choice,
other than to remand her

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,059
to the Seapark Juvenile
Justice Centre in Bangor.

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,639
I don't care what you do.

7
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,219
The only one who's honest is Paul.

8
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,809
The police say they have fresh
evidence to put to Spector.

9
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,009
- What sort of evidence?
<i>- Apparently they have found</i>

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,630
<i>a lock-up rented by Spector.</i>

11
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,179
- Why are you in this place?
- I twisted my sister's arm.

12
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,539
<i>After he broke his sister's arm,
he raped her...</i>

13
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,849
and carried her into the street,

14
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,259
threw her into a passing bin lorry
that crushed her to death.

15
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,479
No-one has any idea how bad
Gortnacull House was.

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,059
Are you certain that Baldwin,

17
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,599
Paul Spector,
was Jensen's favourite?

18
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,189
Every night and every day
for a full year.

19
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,519
Paul Spector,

20
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,619
I am further arresting you

21
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,319
for the murder of Susan Harper

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,379
on the 18th of August 2002.

23
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,289
I insist this interview
be suspended.

24
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,039
I must take instruction
from Mr Spector.

25
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,849
Do you recognise this man?
Do you know his name?

26
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,679
- David Alvarez.
- This interview stops now.

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,980
What is going on?

28
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,939
The police have been clever.

29
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,940
They have something on me
that I can actually remember.

31
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,209
<i>I'd worked that day,</i>

32
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,880
<i>in a Caribbean restaurant.</i>

33
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,900
It was a warm day.

34
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,970
There was thundery rain.

35
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,530
David and I went out after work,

36
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,459
went out drinking.

37
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,440
We went to a local club,
I can't recall the name.

38
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,260
We met Susan Harper there.

39
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,080
She invited us to her house.

40
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,439
I think she shared a house,

41
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,740
but there was no-one there.

42
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,900
- We went up to her room.
- The three of you?

43
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,009
Yes.

44
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,700
What happened?

45
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,160
She and David had sex.

46
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,990
And you?

47
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,320
I watched.

48
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,200
What sort of sex?

49
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,300
Ordinary sex.

50
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,600
What happened then?

51
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,270
David left.

52
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,930
He went out to find more drink.

53
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,950
He left us together.

54
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,640
Go on.

55
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,370
We...

56
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,710
I invited her to try
something a bit different.

57
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,870
What?

58
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,780
A sex game.

59
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,729
What happened was an accident.

60
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,689
- A consensual game?
- Yes.

61
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,419
Then how did this David Alvarez

62
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,149
individual come to be found
guilty if he wasn't even there?

63
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,700
And why murder,
why not manslaughter?

64
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,420
It's complicated.

65
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,139
Did David Alvarez find somewhere
to sell him drink?

66
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,120
I don't know.
He never came back.

67
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,340
Could I please have some water?

68
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,880
Have you...

69
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,410
..remembered more in regard
to the other charges?

70
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,370
No.

71
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,790
It will look bad if you stop
answering now.

72
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,230
Erm...just be careful what you say.

THE FALL
Final Episode of Series

76
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,550
So at that point you were left
alone with Susan Harper?

77
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,179
Yes.

78
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,480
What happened then?

79
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,719
I suggested that she tried
something, erm,

80
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,219
a bit more exciting

81
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,080
than the sex
that she'd had with David.

82
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,860
What?

83
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,860
I'd been experimenting.

84
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:18,950
With?

85
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,850
Exhibit 132.

86
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,469
I've never seen these before.

87
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,829
<i>- You admit it's you?
- He admits no such thing.</i>

88
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,279
Experimenting like that,

89
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,499
<i>with sexual asphyxiation.
Is that</i>

90
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,009
<i>the sort of behaviour you
involved Susan Harper in?</i>

91
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,050
I advise you not to answer
that question.

92
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,740
Yes.

93
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,749
How?

94
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,100
Specifically.

95
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,610
Her head in a plastic bag.

96
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,460
Tied off at the neck?

97
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,289
No,
just a thin plastic bag.

98
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,899
Did you tie her hands?

99
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,239
No, her hands were free.

100
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,090
<i>Was it your suggestion
to use the bag?</i>

101
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,580
<i>- Yes.
- Why?</i>

102
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,729
<i>For the same reasons as</i>

103
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,180
<i>in these pictures,</i>

104
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,939
<i>to feel in control,
to feel out of control...</i>

105
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,240
to feel powerful,

106
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,150
to feel weak,

107
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,840
to be fearful,

108
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,860
- to be trusted.
- Were you supposed to remove it?

109
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,240
She was...

110
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,369
at the peak of orgasm,

111
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,670
to tear off the bag,

112
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,050
it floods the brain with
oxygen-laden blood,

113
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,200
leads to a feeling of euphoria.

114
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,870
Or death.

115
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,070
- Sadly, yes.
- Sadly?

116
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,750
Did she understand the risks
involved with such behaviour?

117
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,400
- I think so.
- Did you explain it?

118
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,150
I don't remember.

119
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,459
Why didn't you remove the bag for
her if she lost consciousness?

120
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,180
Could you not see she was
suffocating?

121
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,260
I wasn't looking at her.

122
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,540
I was going down on her.

123
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,759
We'd been drinking,

124
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,760
taken coke.
Maybe that's why she died.

125
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,689
And yet David Alvarez,

126
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,840
who wasn't even there
at the time,

127
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,410
is serving a life sentence
for the murder.

128
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,929
His choice.

129
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,430
Why would he make that choice,
do you think?

130
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,410
I don't know.

131
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,180
You'll have to ask him.

132
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,569
So what did you do when you
realised what had happened?

133
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,870
Did you call for an ambulance?
Did you call the police?

134
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,080
- No.
- Why not?

135
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,339
- It didn't occur to me.
- What did you do?

136
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,640
Cleaned up.

137
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,889
Does that account
for the presence

138
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,430
of a washing-up bowl by the bed?

139
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,410
Yes.

140
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,190
I fetched the water and washed her.

141
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,329
Emptied it into the bath.

142
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,330
I was meant to bring it back
to the kitchen.

143
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,149
I must have forgotten.

144
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,009
- What colour bowl?
- Green, I think.

145
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,509
So you just left her there,
in her room?

146
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,810
On her bed?

147
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,330
- Yes.
- What did you do then?

148
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,650
- I walked the streets.
- And after that?

149
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,379
Left London.
I came back to Belfast.

150
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,689
- And that's when you became
Paul Spector?
- Yes.

151
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,930
Did you have any communication
with David Alvarez?

152
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,760
- No.
- At no point?

153
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,410
No.

154
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,939
I ask you again,

155
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,480
why would he take the blame,

156
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,310
do you think?

157
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,629
He must have felt he was doing
the right thing, I suppose.

158
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,020
And why would he think...

159
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,189
..taking the blame

160
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,590
was the right thing to do?

161
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,030
You tell me.

162
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,110
He said he felt in your debt.

163
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,260
She speaks.

164
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,200
He said he felt
he owed you a great deal.

165
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,750
Because you protected him
as a child.

166
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,720
Did I?

167
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,660
You told me...

168
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,310
that Father Jensen
didn't abuse you at Gortnacull.

169
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,139
You said that you made
yourself repulsive

170
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,650
so that he wouldn't touch you.

171
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,720
I don't remember that.

172
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,130
I don't recall talking
to you before.

173
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,980
But every boy there was abused
in some way.

174
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,150
No-one escaped.

175
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,680
In fact,

176
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,929
some boys were singled out

177
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,380
for special treatment.

178
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,830
And you

179
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,130
were one of Father Jensen's
favourites.

180
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,340
He even had a pet name for you.

181
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,220
He called you "Pretty Boy".

182
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,109
He chose you to be his favourite

183
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,600
for a whole year.

184
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,350
When it came time for you
to choose your successor...

185
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,150
..you looked right past
David Alvarez.

186
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,430
You chose another boy.

187
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,070
And, for that,

188
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,200
he was eternally grateful.

189
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,839
Or at least until

190
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,840
it became clear
that the friend that he was

191
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,030
protecting from an unfortunate
fatal accident

192
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,859
was actually a friend who was,
at that time,

193
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,550
at the beginning of a career
as a serial murderer.

194
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,760
Drop the charade, Peter.

195
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,170
Own your confession.

196
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,570
Have the courage of your convictions

197
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,070
and admit that you remember it all.

198
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,779
You remember everything.

199
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,529
I'm sorry,
but you are intentionally

200
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,379
prejudicing my client's case.

201
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,770
<i>I will want this removed
from the transcripts.</i>

202
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,510
<i>Were you not worried that
the police would come after you?</i>

203
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,200
<i>Come after Peter Baldwin,
do you mean?</i>

204
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,329
<i>Of no fixed</i>

205
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,740
<i>abode somewhere
in London?</i>

206
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,880
<i>No, I wasn't.</i>

207
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,450
A year later I was Paul Spector,

208
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,170
living in Belfast,

209
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,009
soon to become
a married man

210
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,310
with a child.

211
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,379
Truth be told,
I didn't give Alvarez

212
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,040
and Susan Harper much thought.

213
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,980
You know,

214
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,120
I've been told a lot about
Paul Spector,

215
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,900
since I was shot.

216
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,690
At first I was horrified,

217
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,900
but then, I must admit...

218
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,980
..little by little,

219
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,629
- he's started to intrigue me.
- Paul,

220
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,089
please stick to the facts

221
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,920
surrounding the death
of Susan Harper...

222
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,040
and avoid speculating

223
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,990
about things
you can't remember.

224
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,790
The speculation intrigues me.

225
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:15,199
I'm told that I laid out Sarah
Kay's underwear on her bed,

226
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,500
in the shape of her body.

227
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,330
That's what I used to do as a child.

228
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,249
Lay out my mother's clothes

229
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,630
on her bed, in her shape,

230
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,690
imagine she was there.

231
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,130
It aroused me.

232
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,770
When I was a wee bit older,
12, 13,

233
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,649
whenever I could,
I would obtain

234
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,200
female underwear.

235
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,930
I'd use it to masturbate.

236
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,290
<i>Is that perverse?</i>

237
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,460
<i>Was that the start of something
that led me here?</i>

238
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,710
Or was it earlier?

239
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,790
Gortnacull?

240
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,180
Or earlier still, my mother's death?

241
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,980
I want to know.

242
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,600
I want to know the real me.

243
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,830
Then stop hiding behind
the mask of amnesia.

244
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,520
We're all wearing masks
to some extent.

245
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,490
You certainly are.

246
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:33,870
There are memories,

247
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,950
thoughts that

248
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,000
feel like memories...

249
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,889
..that are starting
to come back to me.

250
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,999
This interview has strayed way
beyond its stated purpose.

251
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,300
And there's a voice.

252
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,419
There's a voice saying,
"We're losing him,

253
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,900
"we're losing him."

254
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,359
So,

255
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,869
there must have been at least
one person who cared

256
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,170
whether I lived or died.

257
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,070
That was me.

258
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,450
That was my voice.

259
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,230
And I did care.

260
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,670
I thought death would
be too easy for you,

261
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,550
too easy an escape.

262
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,680
And I didn't want you to
cheat the system.

263
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,080
And I still don't.

264
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,649
I want you to be punished

265
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,080
for the crimes
that you've committed.

266
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,970
Rose Stagg

267
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,370
was so right about you.

268
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,140
She saw right through you,

269
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:50,669
your infantile desire
to have a captive

270
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,340
and captivated audience.

271
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,220
You just want to be noticed,

272
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,400
you want to be
the centre of attention,

273
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,770
to have special treatment,

274
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,300
to make your mark.

275
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,320
But it's all just a performance.

276
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,120
All of it.

277
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,070
You perform for me,

278
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,060
for your solicitor,

279
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,890
your doctors, your nurse,
your psychiatrist,

280
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,680
even your family.

281
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,110
It's all just

282
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,490
one big performance...

283
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,390
..as protection

284
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,419
against the dreaded

285
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,770
black hole of your heart.

286
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,750
Well, guess what,
Paul,

287
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,650
it's time to grow up.

288
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:53,100
It's time to take responsibility
for what you've done.

289
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,460
Let's stop this pathetic charade.

290
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,009
I really must insist on a break now.

291
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,079
I need time with my client
to prepare

292
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,359
a written statement
about the death

293
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,120
of Susan Harper
that he will read.

294
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,439
Interview is being suspended

295
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,189
at 15.47 so that Paul Spector

296
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,000
can consult with his solicitor.

297
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,790
Fetch the detention officer.

298
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,339
Get your hands off me!
Get your hands off me!

299
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,609
Don't touch me! Do you hear me?!

300
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,490
Don't you put your hands on me!

301
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,940
Have you been drinking?

302
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,469
You, escort Mr Healy
out of here! You...

303
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,920
- where's that fucking ambulance?!
- It's all right.

304
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,660
It's all right, it's all right.

305
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,890
Drive.

306
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,010
Drive!

307
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,870
- I'm shaking.
- How much did you see?

308
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,610
My monitor went dead.
The attack on Gibson.

309
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,449
It didn't stop there.

310
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,749
- What a way for the whole thing to end.
- End?

311
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,329
What do you mean?

312
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,559
We can't possibly represent him now.

313
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,869
Why not?

314
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,289
I've never seen violence
like that before in my life.

315
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,760
What have we just witnessed?

316
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,789
The very thing you described.

317
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,349
Their deep obsession
with each other.

318
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,609
The emergence under duress
of "Bad Paul".

319
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,409
If Larson doesn't find evidence

320
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,769
of dissociative disorder,
a split personality,

321
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,179
then we will find a psychiatrist
who does.

322
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,699
Then we play the "not guilty by
reason of insanity" card or even,

323
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,949
if necessary, "guilty but insane".

324
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,009
I can't, Sean, I can't be in
the same room with him again.

325
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,709
I get it.
You admire her.

326
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,199
You want to be her when you grow up.

327
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,509
The fact remains,

328
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,479
if you can't make the accused
your focus

329
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,039
then you shouldn't be
a defence lawyer,

330
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,549
probably not
a criminal lawyer at all.

331
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,850
Fine.

332
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,930
- What?
- You're on your own.

333
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,130
Open your mouth for me.

334
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,210
Bring your teeth together.

335
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,330
Painful?

336
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,299
No, no.

337
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,309
No crunching noises.
Any problems with vision?

338
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,619
No.

339
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,729
I think you have a minimally
displaced zygoma fracture.

340
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,080
You're going to be on a soft diet
for two weeks or so.

341
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,789
Though the bleeding's
impressive,

342
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,610
the lacerations small.

343
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,489
Might require a stitch or two.
Irrigate the wound

344
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,219
with lots of normal saline
and I'll take a look.

345
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,680
If you'd like to lie back on the bed
for me, please.

346
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,680
- Any pain?
- Some.

347
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:35,750
- Shall I check for blood in the urine?
- Yes, please.

348
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,069
I'd like to keep you in overnight
for observation.

349
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,209
- That won't be necessary.
- Don't worry,

350
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,700
it'll just be bed and breakfast.

351
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,090
I'll be back to stitch that eyebrow.

352
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,900
Thought I'd look in on
you before I go.

353
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,089
What time is it?

354
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,770
Just after two.

355
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,869
This is my ninth straight night
in a row.

356
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,950
I've been on for 17 hours.

357
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,560
Getting too old for this.

358
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,780
I bet you're glad I saved his life.

359
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,490
How's Tom Anderson?

360
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,570
His arm's broken.

361
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,289
He's undergone
a closed reduction

362
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:53,379
to pull the bones
back into position.

363
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,260
He's been sent home with
his arm in a cast.

364
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:01,539
Given that you're less likely
to develop

365
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,579
post-traumatic stress disorder
if you don't sleep

366
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,260
after a bad experience,

367
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:10,390
maybe I should...keep you awake
a wee bit longer at least.

368
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,330
Don't you have a home to go to?

369
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,739
I do. A wife and five kids,
as it happens,

370
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,199
from a daughter of 12 to a son of
seven months.

371
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,610
If I go home now,

372
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,250
it'll be nappy changes
and the four o'clock feed.

373
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,770
Might as well sit with you
for a bit.

374
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,090
I'll ask you questions.

375
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,930
- Really?
- Aye.

376
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,000
Go on.

377
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,290
Do you like flowers?

378
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,300
Of course.

379
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,980
Can you play any musical instrument?

380
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,050
I could play the violin
when I was a girl.

381
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,889
Have you ever been happy?

382
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,390
If so, when?

383
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,450
When I was a child,

384
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,690
before my father died.

385
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,880
Have you any real friends?

386
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,350
A few, yeah.

387
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:17,160
Have you ever wished anyone dead?

388
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,940
Yes, I have.

389
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,020
Are you a good swimmer?

390
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,430
Very.

391
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:36,050
Are men or women the stronger,
do you think?

392
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:41,610
- What do you think?
- Women, without a doubt.

393
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,184
In fact, it's time you hurried up
and took over.

394
00:25:45,185 --> 00:25:47,550
I mean, it's going to happen so
why not get on with it?

395
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,470
Which is your favourite season?

396
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,230
Spring.

397
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,299
<i>Has Mr Spector been
a threat to himself</i>

398
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,869
<i>or others in the past week?</i>

399
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,869
There have been no more
breaches of protocol

400
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,220
since he's been back.

401
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,839
Anything more from the test results?

402
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,129
Have you found any compelling
inconsistencies?

403
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,719
No, I haven't.

404
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,649
Which is unsurprising

405
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,450
given his professional
knowledge.

406
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,569
I know it's in your
nature to infer

407
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:22,779
invisible unconscious processes
behind the memory loss

408
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,339
and that it is an exceptional
doctor

409
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,109
who will take the risk of concluding
in writing that someone

410
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,000
is malingering
but,

411
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,700
with respect,

412
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,180
that is what I think
you should do.

413
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,439
- Do you?
- The CT head scan

414
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,769
with and without
contrast was normal,

415
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:43,329
the MRI of the brain
and the spinal

416
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,099
cord showed normal results.

417
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,519
There's no evidence of
structural brain damage

418
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,280
in the neurological examinations
or neuroimaging.

419
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,259
With his history of lying

420
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,720
and everything
that he stands to gain

421
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,440
from exaggeration
and fabrication of the symptoms,

422
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,740
the amnesia has to be malingered.

423
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:05,550
He's proved how dangerous he is.

424
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,670
It has to be fake.

425
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,350
It's not me.

426
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,270
What?

427
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,880
I look at my body and it's not me.

428
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,960
It'll take a while to get used to,
that's all.

429
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,969
We've had a report,
ma'am,

430
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:06,089
from the Juvenile Offenders'
Centre.

431
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,939
It seems that Katie Benedetto

432
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,650
has been self-harming.

433
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,549
How?

434
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,740
Cutting herself with
a piece of bone.

435
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,509
What?

436
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,919
They think she must
have found it

437
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,420
in her food at some point.

438
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,380
Jesus.

439
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:28,679
<i>Is there a happy memory
from any part of your life</i>

440
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,980
<i>that you can remember?'</i>

441
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:42,560
I used to think that there was
a black hole inside me

442
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,600
that nothing could fill.

443
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,910
Then I had a daughter.

444
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,460
I remember the first time that
I put her to sleep.

445
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,649
I was standing,

446
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,160
holding her in my arms,

447
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,980
rocking her.

448
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,690
I was looking at her all the time.

449
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,860
She was looking up at me.

450
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,480
I began to feel
that she trusted me,

451
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,490
that she felt safe.

452
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,560
She must have done because

453
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,710
her eyelids started closing...

454
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,020
..little by little,

455
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,640
and then she was asleep.

456
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,670
That's a good memory.

457
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,260
Why did you attack Stella Gibson?

458
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:42,380
Why did you break that
young man's arm?

459
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,150
There is a visible
and an invisible world.

460
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,010
That's why people get hurt.

461
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,290
Do you think I'm treatable?

462
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,260
Of course.

463
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,160
Curable?

464
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,110
That's different.

465
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,110
What would you do for me
if I was your patient?

466
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,639
Try to get you to pay attention

467
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,140
wisely to things as they are.

468
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:47,560
Foster clear thinking

469
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,560
and open-heartedness.

470
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:54,009
Try to develop the capacity
in you

471
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,559
to experience a feeling without

472
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,100
necessarily acting on it.

473
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:02,049
Try to enable you to see
the difference between

474
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,700
thoughts and reality.

475
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,980
I'd imagine you're a good father.

476
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,790
What do you mean by "good father"?

477
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:21,000
Someone who is present,

478
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,340
there for his children.

479
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,759
<i>Has anyone ever told you
you sometimes have</i>

480
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,889
<i>bad dreams that you
can't remember?</i>

481
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,100
Has your mummy or your daddy
ever told you that?

482
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,359
Yes.
Mummy took me

483
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,120
to the doctor's one time.

484
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:49,599
Have you had any bad dreams

485
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,649
since you've been staying
with Joan and Stephen?

486
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,240
I don't think so.

487
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,530
She hasn't.
She's been sleeping well.

488
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,339
Daddy said he had bad dreams
like mine when

489
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,050
he was in the children's home.

490
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,880
Did he?

491
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,220
Did he say
what he dreamed about?

492
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,230
Frightening things.

493
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:12,180
How do you feel about your daddy
right now, Olivia?

494
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,730
I love him.

495
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,630
But?

496
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,340
I don't think I'll go see him
for a while.

497
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,369
How long do you think before
you'll see him again?

498
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,909
When I'm grown up I might.

499
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,490
Or if I have a baby.

500
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:31,100
If I have a baby,
I might go take her to see him.

501
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,240
<i>What happened to your face?</i>

502
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,440
I was in a car accident.

503
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,510
No, I wasn't.

504
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,840
Paul Spector attacked me.

505
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,590
I've got marks like that.

506
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,730
- Show me.
- I can't.

507
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,720
Why?

508
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:13,390
They're on my upper thighs and on
the soles of my feet.

509
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,550
I didn't want anyone to know,

510
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,380
to see them.

511
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,790
They were private.

512
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,780
Why did you do it?

513
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,910
I think for the same reason you do.

514
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,920
What's that?

515
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:36,750
Anger.

516
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,320
What did you have to be angry about?

517
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,380
My father.

518
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,570
Why?

519
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,780
He died.

520
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,190
How?

521
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,150
He was ill.

522
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,190
How old were you?

523
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:08,390
14.

524
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,880
My father killed himself.

525
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,150
I thought it was an accident.

526
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,820
He chose to ride a motorbike.

527
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,370
Even though I worried about him
every time he went out...

528
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,140
..every night he was late home.

529
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,240
He loved the bike more than
he loved me.

530
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,279
Loved the thrill of speed

531
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,110
more than he loved
his only daughter.

532
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,200
I don't call that an accident.

533
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:53,790
Is that why you're throwing
your life away?

534
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,430
You know you can't get him back.

535
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:03,000
No matter how hard you try.

536
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,020
"There was a man of double deed,

537
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:34,270
"Who sowed his
garden full of seed;

538
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,600
"When the seed began to grow,

539
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,180
"'Twas like a garden full of snow;

540
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,680
"When the snow began to melt,

541
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,950
"'Twas like a ship without a belt;

542
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:51,300
"When the ship began to sail,

543
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:55,530
"'Twas like a bird without a tail;

544
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:59,420
"When the bird began to fly,

545
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:03,010
"'Twas like an eagle in the sky;

546

"When the sky began to roar,

00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,640
"'Twas like a stick across my back;

00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:23,710
"When my back began to smart,

"..'Twas death,

00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,970
"and death,

555
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,120
"and death indeed."

556
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,870
I need you to do me a favour.

557
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:13,050
<i>I know that everything
feels tainted,</i>

558
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,080
<i>polluted.</i>

559
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,110
But it's not.

560
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,960
We all have those
voices in our heads,

561
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,450
that tell us we're
a disappointment,

562
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,520
that tell us our work
is insignificant.

563
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,339
That it's not good enough,

564
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,520
it takes too long,
it's too hard.

565
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,190
But when times are tough,

566
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,680
we need tough dreams.

567
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,140
But real dreams, not lies.

568
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,410
Not an unreality like Paul.

569
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,850
You need to fight for yourself,
Katie,

570
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,320
because right now...

571
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,220
..you're in danger.

572
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,940
What's this?

573
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,980
It's your chocolate.

574
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,219
I don't want that chocolate.
I want what he's got.

575
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,669
Mark, you're diabetic.
That's your special chocolate.

576
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,270
I don't like special chocolate.
I want what he's got.

577
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,779
This stuff tastes like
dog chocolate.

578
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,690
I'm not eating dog chocolate!

579
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,199
I'm afraid it's this or nothing.

580
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,750
Then give me my money back.

581
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,650
I've spent your money
on the things you asked for.

582
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,510
I want my money back!

583
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,529
- Mark, calm yourself.
- I'm not a dog.

584
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,039
I'm not eating that shit.
I refuse.

585
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,979
Calm down, Mark,
or you'll be restrained.

586
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,089
What did you say to me?
You called me a homosexual!

587
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,499
- I didn't call you anything!
- You called me a homosexual!

588
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,800
Calm down now!

589
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:16,000
<i>We all need love</i>

590
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:18,700
<i>and we all need nurture.</i>

591
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:22,070
<i>There's too much death
and destruction.</i>

592
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,240
But friends who
love you should...

593
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,230
..warm you like the sun.

594
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,510
Make you feel good about yourself.

595
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,939
Not freeze you in their contempt

596
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,380
and in their hate.

597
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:41,699
Anger corrodes our belief

598
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,000
that anything good
can happen to us.

599
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,910
Paul's been destroyed
by his anger,

600
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,300
his rage.

601
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,720
And you,

602
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,250
you hurt a friend,

603
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,920
to impress him.

604
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:08,020
But he doesn't care.

605
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,110
He doesn't even know you exist.

606
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,959
Watch his head, watch his head.

607
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,869
And out, and out.
Let's go! Let's go.

608
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:04,100
Go, go, go!

609
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:20,129
Fuck off! That's right,
fuck the lot of you!

610
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:22,340
Fuck off!

611
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,140
You and I were loved so much...

612
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:18,320
..even if our fathers couldn't
stay around for us.

613
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:22,530
Maybe we both need to be held
while we grieve,

614
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,330
but it has to be someone
who can feel pain for our pain,

615
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:30,890
not revel in it.

616
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,740
Not someone who will abandon us.

617
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:10,329
Sweet Jesus.

618
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:12,049
Somebody call for an ambulance!

619
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:13,730
Call an ambulance.

620
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,620
Where's Spector?

621
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,450
Where's Spector?!

622
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:48,509
Check the treatment room!
The de-escalation room!

623
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:50,170
Check the kitchen!

624
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,610
Shit!
Bailey's room!

625
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,850
God!

626
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:27,629
Got him, got him.

627
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:30,290
Quick. Mind his head,
mind his head, mind his head.

628
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,860
Get the belt, get the belt.

629
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:38,890
Paul, Paul.

630
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,620
I'm sorry.

Gibson.

632
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,550
OK.

633
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,450
What is it?

634
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:08,029
- I have to go.
- What's happened?

635
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:10,109
I can't tell you.
I'm sorry.

636
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:11,410
Is it Paul?

637
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:16,690
Bye, Katie.

638
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:51,120
God, Dr Larson,

639
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,230
I'm sorry,

640
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,900
I'm so sorry.

<i>To pass the time</i>

697

and then catch it.</i>

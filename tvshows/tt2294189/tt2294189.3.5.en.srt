1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,759
Do you believe you did
the things they say you did?

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,469
If I did, I wasn't
arrested, I was rescued.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,379
<i>The truth of a confession is
immaterial.</i>

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,589
What's important is how
it was obtained.

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,149
I'm suggesting Gibson deliberately
provoked him.

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,109
How were we to know
she was that desperate?

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,749
<i>Now you can add</i>
attempted murder

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,059
to her list of charges.

9
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,119
- Are you Sean Healy?
- Yes!

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,020
Will you give this to Paul for me?

11
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,649
<i>Paul Spector is due to be
moved today.</i>

12
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,489
The next stage
of his assessments

13
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,010
are about to begin.

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,889
Mr Spector.
I'm August Larson,

15
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,049
the lead clinician here.

16
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,649
<i>I need you to go to London.</i>

17
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,289
I don't think we can afford to
dismiss the connection

18
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,079
between David Alvarez
and Paul Spector.

19
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,159
<i>We've had a request</i>
to disclose your dream diary.

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,839
He's in hospital,
he's incapacitated

21
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,779
<i>and yet he's still
infecting the lives</i>

22
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,509
of every person he
comes into contact with.

23
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,639
If a person is able
to do to others

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,590
what he fears may
be done to him,

25
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,169
he may no longer be afraid.

26
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,309
Doctor, I understand that for
you he's a patient,

27
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,989
someone worthy of understanding,
compassion, even.

28
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,589
But to me he's a...
He's a sexual predator.

29
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,779
I'm Mark Bailey, who are you?

30
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,120
I'm told I'm the Belfast Strangler.

<i>Detective Superintendent Gibson?</i>

33
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,549
<i>Dr Larson.
What can I do for you?</i>

34
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,539
Mr Spector's defence team

35
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,619
have sent me some excerpts
from your diary.

36
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,919
The pages where it is alleged

37
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,750
Mr Spector made an entry.

38
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,620
I see.

39
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,110
<i>I sense your discomfort.</i>

40
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,129
I have no doubt,

41
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,959
after seeing the entry he made,

42
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,289
knowing that he'd read your journal
felt like a violation.

43
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,590
Yes.

44
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,940
<i>May I ask you,</i>

45
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,410
how long have you kept a diary?

46
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,400
<i>All of my life.</i>

47
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,320
But not really since
I've been in Belfast.

48
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,750
I don't follow.

49
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,230
What Spector wrote in was
more of a dream journal.

50
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,210
<i>Why do you keep a dream journal?</i>

51
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,550
Why do you want to know?

52
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,550
Curiosity, probably.

53
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,970
<i>Initially, I kept it as an
investigative tool.</i>

54
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,190
I trained myself to wake up in the
middle of the night and...

55
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,950
..write down random thoughts.

56
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,780
<i>Then I guess since then,</i>

57
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,730
<i>it's become a compulsion,
of sorts.</i>

58
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,190
So you see dreams as
a kind of problem-solving?

59
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,379
<i>I think maybe the sleeping brain</i>

60
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:18,200
makes connections more quickly
than the waking mind does.

61
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,920
<i>That is certainly possible.</i>

62
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,180
I will treat the entries
with respect.

63
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,840
Thank you.

64
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,140
Goodnight, Dr Larson.

65
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,870
<i>Goodnight.</i>

<i>Oi!
What's all this!</i>

69
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,109
<i>Paul Spector, a 32-year-old,
right-handed male.</i>

70
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,409
Referred from the
criminal justice system

71
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,129
for appraisal with
regard to his fitness

72
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,390
to plead and stand trial.

73
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,880
The charge sheet gives you
an idea of the alleged crimes.

74
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,689
Shot in police custody,

75
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,759
he underwent a splenectomy

76
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,609
so we should be mindful

77
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,320
of his post-operative condition and
ongoing medical needs.

78
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,679
<i>In hospital,
after regaining consciousness,</i>

79
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,209
<i>he presented with severe
retrograde amnesia</i>

80
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,730
<i>in the absence of significant
anterograde amnesia.</i>

81
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,400
<i>I'm told Paul Spector never knew
his biological father.</i>

82
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,249
<i>His mother, Mary Garrison,</i>

83
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,200
<i>committed suicide
when he was eight years old.</i>

84
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,500
<i>She hanged herself.</i>

85
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,809
After a period of two years
in a foster home

86
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,520
that appears to have been a
stable and safe environment,

87
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,789
<i>he was transferred to
Gortnacull House.</i>

88
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,640
<i>He was there for three years.</i>

89
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,349
At 13 he was sent to
another home in the South -

90
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,020
Dundalk, County Louth.

91
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,149
Apart from a very
agitated first wake up

92
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:32,399
and a violent emotional response

93
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,629
to being presented with
some of the evidence against him,

94
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,869
the hospital reports him having been
docile,

95
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:44,640
co-operative - friendly, even.

96
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,389
It is also very possible
he is someone who acts out

97
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:52,559
in a dangerous and illegal manner.

98
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,600
<i>The police officer
Detective Superintendent Gibson...</i>

99
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,229
<i>..who at this stage might well be
the person who knows him best,</i>

100
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,590
<i>suggests he has a narcissistic,
sadistic personality.</i>

101
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,779
With regard to his memory loss,

102
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,649
he could be feigning,

103
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:16,490
exaggerating or simply malingering.

104
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,729
So I suggest we approach Mr Spector
with...

105
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,390
respectful scepticism.

106
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,539
<i>The daily structure is 8 to 9,
breakfast,</i>

107
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,589
9 to 10, self-care tasks,

108
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,059
washing, dressing, laundry,
bed-making.

109
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,889
10 to 12 is therapy or
a 45-minute activity -

110
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,549
art, music whatever.

111
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,579
12 to 2 is lunch and rest period.

112
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,319
2 to 4 is therapy or further
activity -

113
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,709
life skills, relaxation,

114
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,849
self-awareness,
cooking.

115
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,219
5 to 6.30 is dinner and rest.

116
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,369
And 6.30 to 9.30 is leisure - pool,
watching a movie.

117
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,229
Back in your room at 9.30.
Lights out at 10.

118
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,939
Dr Larson will see you
later this morning.

119
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,710
Collect your breakfast there.

120
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,209
<i>- All right? Eh, wee fry.
- Just a wee one.</i>

121
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,510
<i>You all right, mate?</i>

122
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,099
- Ma'am.
- Yeah.

123
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,380
I have a copy of the letter
you asked for.

124
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,040
Thanks.

125
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,879
<i>I probably shouldn't
write this letter to you</i>

126
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,719
<i>but this is hard evidence
to you that I exist,</i>

127
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,190
<i>exist for you, Paul.</i>

128
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,609
<i>I can feel you all over me,</i>

129
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,929
like that night in your study,

130
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:13,249
<i>I feel you crawling through my
veins, through my mind,</i>

131
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,240
<i>you grab and suffocate
my thoughts.</i>

132
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:20,139
<i>I am in pain for your pleasure.</i>

133
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,869
<i>I have forsaken my friends,</i>

134
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,130
<i>I have forsaken my family,</i>

135
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,720
<i>I am choosing my next move
carefully.</i>

136
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,899
<i>Their love is fake.</i>

137
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,450
<i>Fuck everyone who wants me
to step into the light.</i>

138
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,619
<i>It will burn my skin off.</i>

139
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,829
<i>The skin that I will carve our
poetry into</i>

140
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,660
<i>so you will be with me for ever.</i>

141
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,969
<i>I yearn for you when I stare into
the starless midnight.</i>

142
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,170
<i>You are the vast expanse
of the sky.</i>

143
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,900
I don't regret a thing,
because the pain is all for you.

144
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,809
<i>I will still love you</i>

145
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,149
<i>when I finally know
everything about you.</i>

146
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,500
<i>That's true love.</i>

147
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,059
<i>I fucking hate this.</i>

148
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,299
<i>I hate being without you.</i>

149
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,309
<i>I would kill them all if I could.
Crush them.</i>

150
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,780
<i>Crush them and their pathetic
lives.</i>

151
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,399
<i>Ma'am,
my client accepts</i>

152
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,550
<i>that she
has breached her bail conditions.</i>

153
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,169
Her attempts to contact
Mr Spector,

154
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,429
the fact that she stayed away from
her home address,

155
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,229
breaching her curfew.

156
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,329
But there are mitigating factors,

157
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,620
Ma'am, that I'd like to draw
your attention to.

158
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,109
The defendant lost her father when
she was aged 13

159
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,059
in a motorcycle accident,

160
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,459
a shockingly violent accident.

161
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,499
She is now just 16 years old
and the best place for her

162
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,649
to be at this difficult time
is at home.

163
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,159
Her mother,
who is present today in court,

164
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,489
is prepared to stand surety.

165
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,789
I have checked with the police and
they are happy

166
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,129
as to the source of the monies
offered by Mrs Benedetto

167
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,679
to support the suretyship,

168
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,569
namely savings she has
accumulated to...

169
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,750
Mr McSwain,
let me just stop you there.

170
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,209
Now, your client is not just in
breach of her bail conditions,

171
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,459
she is alleged by the prosecution

172
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,789
to have committed another very
serious offence -

173
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:14,059
throwing a corrosive fluid with
intent to harm.

174
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,209
Had it not been for the quick
thinking of a friend,

175
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,869
who irrigated her eyes
with a drink,

176
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,959
the victim might well
have lost her sight.

177
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,339
Now, I feel I have no choice,
therefore,

178
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:27,149
other than to remand her to the Seapark
Juvenile Justice Centre in Bangor.

179
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,109
There she will be appointed
a case manager and a key worker

180
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,669
who can assess her needs.

181
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,129
She will be able to attend school
also, if she so wishes.

182
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:37,770
I don't care what you do,
or what you think, or say.

183
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,539
The only one who's honest is Paul.

184
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,939
He's the only person I choose
to listen to,

185
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,980
the only person who sees this world
for what it really is.

186
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,369
Full of sheep like you being
fattened for slaughter.

187
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,179
Pigs waiting for the butcher.

188
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,859
You have a lawyer to look
after your interests.

189
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,529
Any issues you may have,
you address them through him.

190
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,649
Fuck you. Fuck you all.

191
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,200
Security, please!

192
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,039
<i>You requested all the
Susan Harper files?</i>

193
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,999
<i>- That's right.</i>
- This is everything that we have here.

194
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,300
Well, thank you.

195
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,854
OK,
so this is what I'm thinking.

196
00:13:38,855 --> 00:13:40,689
We lodge civil proceedings

197
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,819
and make an abuse
of process application.

198
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,299
Adverse publicity?

199
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,849
That certainly, but also police
misconduct.

200
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,339
Specifically,
Detective Superintendent Gibson.

201
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,409
I want you to draw together all the
strands of police and

202
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,129
prosecution behaviour that
has been questionable.

203
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:58,979
- Starting with the stage-managed arrest?
- Before that.

204
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,869
From the point the investigation
assumed his guilt and focused

205
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,840
on him and him alone.

206
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,669
Stage managing the arrest,
the additional sexual oppression,

207
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,169
the failure to bring
him to court

208
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,699
promptly once he was charged,

209
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,019
all of it a vendetta from the
start against our client.

210
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,189
Do you think that adds up to
misconduct of sufficient gravity?

211
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,329
- To warrant a stay?
- Maybe not,

212
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,420
but it will certainly
cause a delay.

213
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,300
We need more than just issues of
competency to work with.

214
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:29,580
The abuse of process application
more than adds up.

215
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,729
You suspect

216
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:36,340
that Gibson had a previous
relationship with Burns.

217
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,099
It seems she has also had liaisons
with other colleagues.

218
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,809
Spector was in the hotel room

219
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,650
when Burns was there
with Gibson.

220
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,420
Let's assume therefore that Spector
had knowledge of that relationship.

221
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,399
He also had access
to her dream diary

222
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,749
which gave him insights
into her other liaisons.

223
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,579
What if the damage
this could cause

224
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,199
Stella Gibson's career
was a possible motive

225
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,790
for her failure
to protect him in the forest?

226
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,319
Spector's whereabouts were
leaked by a detention officer

227
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,149
within the custody suite.

228
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,859
What if Gibson was in on that leak?

229
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,219
What if Spector's life
was deliberately

230
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,379
put at risk by Gibson
through police misconduct?

231
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,079
Everyone knew Tyler was
out there with a loaded gun

232
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,249
and a clearly stated aim
to find and kill Spector.

233
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,010
And she let it happen.

234
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,520
Let's make her pay.

235
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,140
Do you have your own room key?

236
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,240
No.

237
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,240
I do.

238
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,020
I'm allowed to feed the
fish in the aquarium.

239
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,399
I used to help with serving
the meals

240
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,380
but I gave larger portions
to people I liked so,

241
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,420
I'm not allowed to do that any more.

242
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,420
I have art today, so...

243
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,750
Wasn't well, better now.

244
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,530
Wasn't well, better now.

245
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,379
<i>I don't think there was any
criminal intent.</i>

246
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,510
<i>She approached you, she invited
you back to her place.</i>

247
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,379
"I'm not saying she was asking
for it necessarily,

248
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,559
"but we've all been there,
too much to drink,

249
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,769
"one thing leads to another,
things get out of hand.

250
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,479
"We're used to dealing with these
sorts of offences.

251
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,739
"We understand how these
things can happen."

252
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,329
What officer is that talking?

253
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,209
Er, this is Rees.

254
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,259
"What did she do to anger you,
David?

255
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,800
"Did she insult you?
What made it turn nasty?

256
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:19,089
"Was she still dressed when you
had sex with her?"

257
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:21,099
"Alvarez: Maybe."

258
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,000
"She wasn't was she? She was naked.
Did she ask you to tie her up?

259
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,369
"David? Was she into bondage?
Tell us how you killed her."

260
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,219
"I strangled her."

261
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,099
"- How did you strangle her?"
"- With my belt."

262
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,329
"You see, David, if you say that,
you're not helping me.

263
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:40,359
"- You didn't use your belt, did you?"
"- No."

264
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,970
"What did you use?

265
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,089
"Come on, David,
think about what you used."

266
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:48,569
"Hathaway: You'd taken your
clothes off, David.

267
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,870
"You were naked, weren't you?"

268
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,109
"Yes."

269
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,100
"So what did you use to
strangle her?"

270
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,839
"Just my hands, just my bare hands."

271
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,769
"There were no strangulation
marks

272
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,599
"on her neck, David.
None.

273
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,890
"Were there any pillows on the
bed, David?"

274
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,669
"I smothered her.

275
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,900
"I took a pillow and put it over her
face and smothered her."

276
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,589
I mean, Jesus,
there's leading the witness

277
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,890
and there's shoving
words down his throat.

278
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,860
Why weren't Alvarez's defence
all over this?

279
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,699
<i>I'm afraid the typical
relationship</i>

280
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,249
between a psychiatrist and patient,
where everything that is said

281
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,469
in this room is confidential,
does not apply.

282
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,399
Anything you tell me
can be put in the report.

283
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,479
Because it is the Court that
has asked me to conduct

284
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,379
the evaluation,
you don't have the right

285
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,949
to refuse to participate.

286
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,869
Even if you, for example,

287
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,889
choose not to answer
my questions,

288
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,789
I will still need to provide
the written report that will be

289
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:55,959
sent to the court and made
available to your lawyer.

290
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,049
If the judge orders a hearing

291
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,759
on the issue of your competency

292
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,220
I might be called to testify
in court.

293
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,039
Do you understand?

294
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,700
Yes, I do.
I will answer your questions.

295
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,519
Good.

296
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,820
That's good.

297
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,990
<i>Tom.
Have a look at this.</i>

298
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,200
This was a key part of the
prosecution's case.

299
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,129
That's the victim,
Susan Harper,

300
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,380
and that's David Alvarez
leaving the nightclub together.

301
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,150
Who is that, do you think?

302
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,040
Do you understand the police's
version of events?

303
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,410
The severity of the charges?

304
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,650
Yes, I do.

305
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,790
Do you remember making a confession?

306
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,700
No.

307
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,429
Can you provide a reasonable account
of your behaviour around the time

308
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,680
of the various alleged offences?

309
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,690
No.

310
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,149
Or your state of mind?

311
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,460
No.

312
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,989
Do you think you could manage your
emotions and behaviour

313
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,640
in a courtroom?

314
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,439
I think I could, yes.

315
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,429
Do you think you would be able to
keep track of events

316
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,520
as they unfolded?

317
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,660
Yes.

318
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,499
Would you be able to
challenge witnesses?

319
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:47,030
That is, to recognise distortions
in witness testimony?

320
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,600
No, I wouldn't be able to do that.

321
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,890
Not unless my memory returned.

322
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,989
Do you understand the sentence that
could be imposed on you

323
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,100
if you are found guilty?

324
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,260
I would spend the rest of
my life in prison.

325
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,080
Will my memory return, Doctor?

326
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,120
Do you want it to?

327
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,259
I might have something
significant, ma'am.

328
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,309
A Peter Baldwin
working as a waiter

329
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,469
in a Caribbean restaurant
called the Plantain Garden.

330
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,679
And the restaurant went bust,

331
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,149
closed in 2008, but the owner still
has his paperwork.

332
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,709
He had reason to give
Peter Baldwin a warning,

333
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,350
a reprimand that stayed on file.

334
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:51,120
It's dated Saturday August
the 17th, 2002.

335
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,220
The day before the Harper murder.

336
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,019
Why was he reprimanded?

337
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,579
An argument with a customer
that turned nasty,

338
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,890
came to blows.

339
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,384
And the owner positively
identified Spector?

340
00:22:05,385 --> 00:22:07,829
I sent him all the photographs
we have on file.

341
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,049
He seems pretty certain.

342
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:12,260
The restaurant was in SW9.

343
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,920
Susan Harper's flat was in SW16.

344
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,160
That's Brixton and Streatham.

345
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,620
Both in Lambeth.

346
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,020
<i>I will, thanks for letting us know.</i>

347
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,309
The police say they have fresh
evidence to put to Spector.

348
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,489
What sort of evidence?

349
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,679
Forensic, documentary.

350
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,559
Apparently they have found
a lock-up rented by Spector.

351
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,789
They want to interview him
about the contents.

352
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,319
Fuck!

353
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,569
I'll need to see proof of that and
all the information that was

354
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,159
placed before the judge to
get those warrants.

355
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,229
Get back to the PPS first thing
in the morning.

356
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,489
I want full disclosure.

357
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,679
Oh also, contact The Foyle,

358
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,860
see if Larson thinks Spector's fit
to be interviewed.

359
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,220
Fuck!

360
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,609
<i>It could be Spector.</i>

361
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:54,949
<i>Rose Stagg puts Spector in
London at the right time.</i>

362
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,980
<i>22 years old, clean-shaven.</i>

363
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,560
<i>It's hard to tell.</i>

364
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,450
No, it's not.

365
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,510
That's him.

366
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,760
I know it's him.

367
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,350
<i>Well, we couldn't quite believe the
interrogation tactics -</i>

368
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,769
<i>a classic old school interview -</i>

369
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,999
trickery, deceit,
psychological manipulation.

370
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,759
Alvarez thought he'd be able to go
home after confessing.

371
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,369
And it seems he fell for it all.

372
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,349
For some reason
he seemed eager to please.

373
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,649
I've no idea why the defence team
weren't all over it.

374
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,460
<i>All the evidence
was pretty strong -</i>

375
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,719
<i>the only other fingerprints
found at her flat were Alvarez's</i>

376
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,259
<i>and the only DNA recovered
from her body was his.</i>

377
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,279
True, but when it comes
to the actual murder

378
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,939
they had to lead him by the nose

379
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,999
to get him
to where they wanted him to be.

380
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,800
He really seemed to lack
detailed knowledge.

381
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,780
<i>I have a good feeling about this.</i>

382
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,450
I can smell Spector's involvement.

383
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,549
And when do you see Alvarez?

384
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,220
In the morning.

385
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,770
Call me with any developments.

386
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,440
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

387
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,720
We can order things off the nurses.

388
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,059
They go shopping twice a week.

389
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,560
You just give them the money and
they'll get you the things you want.

390
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,730
I don't have any money.

391
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,540
Why are you in this place?

392
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,840
Don't tell me if you don't want to.

393
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,970
I twisted my sister's arm.

394
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,480
I twisted it so far round it broke.

395
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,240
Why did you do that?

396
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,029
I had a haircut.

397
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,919
It...

398
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,200
gave me a new personality.
It made me more feminine.

399
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,659
I thought I was turning homosexual.

400
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,969
When I came home,

401
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,729
my sister said I looked gay.

402
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,729
So I twisted her arm.

403
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,130
She was screaming and I didn't stop.

404
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,879
Then it snapped.

405
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,260
Then I suppose I...panicked.

406
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,900
How old was she?

407
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,599
Younger than me.

408
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,900
- How much younger?
- Quite a lot younger.

409
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,239
What's your diagnosis?

410
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,960
A psychotic with convulsive
disorder.

411
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,890
They say I had childhood
schizophrenia.

412
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,529
I thought there were hidden messages
in the colours of cars

413
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,439
passing on the street.

414
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,609
I started communicating
with car sounds.

415
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:23,920
And then the sounds turned
into voices.

416
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,919
What kind of voices?

417
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:31,920
Like...people,
but just out of hearing.

418
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,220
When I'm bad,
I see faces in the mirror.

419
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,080
The risperidone helps.

420
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,829
How long have you been in
this place?

421
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,039
Five years.

422
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,480
I was on the news, but not like you.

423
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,400
It's time to go to your room now,
Paul.

424
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,349
12, is the answer to your question.

425
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,659
What?

426
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,189
Mark Bailey's sister.
12 years old.

427
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:28,550
And he left out the best bit.

428
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,279
After he broke his sister's arm,

429
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,639
he raped her, then carried her
into the street,

430
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,080
threw her into a passing bin lorry
that crushed her to death.

431
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,750
The dregs of humanity.

432
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,300
Sweet dreams.

433
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,120
Anderson.

434
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,350
<i>It's Assistant
Chief Constable Burns.</i>

435
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,750
Good evening, sir.

436
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,629
I understand you're seeing
Alvarez tomorrow?

437
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,930
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

438
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,789
I thought I might tell you something
about Gortnacull

439
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,739
that might be useful.

440
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,680
Thank you, sir.

441
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,600
<i>I remember...</i>

442
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,819
<i>..when I arrived there,</i>

443
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:50,200
<i>being struck by how
grand-looking it was.</i>

444
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,169
<i>Lovely gardens, outside pool,</i>

445
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,060
<i>views over Belfast Lough.</i>

446
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:03,359
Apparently so much
more than the boys

447
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,610
would have been used to
at home in Belfast.

448
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,244
Just off the entrance hall

449
00:30:10,245 --> 00:30:12,360
there was a large dining room.

450
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,239
All the boys we interviewed

451
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,600
told of how they were
taken there every day...

452
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,479
..and made to masturbate

453
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,150
to entertain the staff members.

454
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,879
<i>Masturbate themselves,</i>

455
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,820
<i>masturbate members of staff.</i>

456
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,570
<i>We did fluorescence tests
on the carpet.</i>

457
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,850
<i>It was covered in stains.</i>

458
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,819
David Alvarez was there

459
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:56,549
at the same time
as Paul Spector...

460
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,440
as Peter Baldwin.

461
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,080
He would know about that.

462
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,800
He would remember that dining room.

463
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,680
That-that was all.

464
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,600
Just...

465
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,520
That was all.

466
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,059
I just took a call from the
DPP, ma'am.

467
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:29,389
It seems that Sean Healy
has lodged a complaint against you

468
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,919
with the Police Ombudsman.

469
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,229
I see.

470
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,980
Also an abuse of process
application.

471
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,800
You'd better give me the details.

472
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,119
<i>This is my client, David Alvarez.</i>

473
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,559
David, this is Detective Sergeant
Tom Anderson

474
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,440
and PC Dani Ferrington.

475
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:02,369
Thanks very much for
talking to us, David.

476
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,030
I haven't yet.

477
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,869
You understand that
it's in connection with

478
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,500
your conviction for murder?

479
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,039
- Frazer's explained, yes.
- Good.

480
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,499
I wonder, do you recognise this man?

481
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,439
For the purposes of the tape,

482
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,960
I'm showing David a picture
of a male individual.

483
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,639
I do, yes.

484
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,560
What name do you know him by?

485
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,939
Peter Baldwin.

486
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,680
How do you know Peter Baldwin?

487
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,589
We were in Gortnacull House
together.

488
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,150
When was that?

489
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,779
Ah, I was there from 1990 to 1994.

490
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,359
I'm a year younger than him.

491
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,009
Right.
And when was the last time

492
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:52,410
that you saw Peter Baldwin?

493
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,159
In 2002.

494
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,879
- Where was that?
- In London.

495
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,329
And what were the circumstances
of that meeting?

496
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,739
- Was he there at your invitation?
- No, we met by chance.

497
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,419
The last time I'd seen him was

498
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,109
at Gortnacull when I was 12.

499
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,890
At Gortnacull with Father Jensen.

500
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,009
<i>Perhaps we can talk about
the period in your life</i>

501
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:19,609
before you were first incarcerated.

502
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:22,360
When you compiled your own map
of Dundalk.

503
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,119
What do you want to know?

504
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,770
When did that behaviour
begin for you?

505
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,629
What behaviour?

506
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,200
The voyeurism.

507
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,159
Around that age. 13 or so.

508
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:45,560
What were you seeking, do you think,
in behaving in that way?

509
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,300
Relief.

510
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,889
From?

511
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,420
Boredom.

512
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,960
Loneliness.

513
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,189
It was exciting that they were...

514
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,430
unsuspecting, unaware.

515
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,379
Because of the possibility
of seeing someone naked,

516
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,989
or disrobing,

517
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:11,599
or engaging in sexual activity?

518
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,120
No, not just that.

519
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,360
Then what?

520
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,350
Seeing into homes.

521
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,639
Real homes.

522
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,200
Comfortable, warm.

523
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,630
A glimpse into lives being led.

524
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,400
Full lives.

525
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,679
I'd imagine myself in those homes,

526
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,589
as part of those lives,
at the dinner table...

527
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:49,159
watching television
with the fire on.

528
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:53,280
How did it make you feel,
being on the outside looking in?

529
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,840
Lonely.

530
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,560
Angry?

531
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,060
Yes.

532
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,200
Aroused?

533
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,640
When did you start breaking in?

534
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,800
When I'd built up the courage.

535
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,120
How did you do that?

536
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,680
I'd get closer to them.

537
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,660
How?

538
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,160
I'd telephone them.

539
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,049
Deliver their newspapers.

540
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:43,639
Ride with them on the bus.

541
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,680
Once, I even carried
a woman's shopping home for her.

542
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,800
Were the break-ins spontaneous,
or did you plan?

543
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,390
I made extensive, elaborate plans.

544
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,879
I discovered that it was easy.

545
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,929
For the most part, people feel safe.

546
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,679
They forget to turn the alarm on,

547
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,360
leave windows open, patio doors.

548
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,270
I didn't want anyone to feel safe.

549
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,960
Why should they have that luxury?

550
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,309
<i>We just hung out.
We drank, we took drugs.</i>

551
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,829
What sort of drugs?

552
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,569
Coke, mainly.

553
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,240
Where was this?

554
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,279
In Brixton.

555
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,980
We shared a flat in Brixton,
in Coldharbour Lane.

556
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,629
Were you with Paul Spector...

557
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,439
Peter Baldwin...

558
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,150
on the night that
Susan Harper died, David?

559
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,060
We think you were.

560
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,409
I'm producing a lap top

561
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:04,850
showing CCTV
footage of Exhibit NS1.

562
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,249
Taken from Edenvale Road,
London, SW9,

563
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:15,420
on Sunday the 18th of August 2002
at 1:45am.

564
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,819
We think that's Paul Spector,

565
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:22,000
leaving the club with you and Susan
on the night that she died.

566
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,829
<i>So your interest in voyeurism</i>

567
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:30,749
<i>gave way to a desire to</i>

568
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,359
break into the observed space?

569
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,440
To violate those individuals
in a more intimate way?

570
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,240
You're thinking that the voyeurism
was a...

571
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:49,639
..precursor to more aggressive
sexual deviancies?

572
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,559
No,
I'm just trying to understand

573
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,930
the progression of your criminality.

574
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,199
I thought I'd put it all behind me.

575
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,109
When I married Sally Ann.
When Olivia was born.

576
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:11,749
I thought that was all in the past,

577
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,519
troubles of my youth.

578
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,989
But now I'm being told that

579
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,600
it was the opposite.

580
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,040
Like an addict,
I'd gone from bad to worse.

581
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,549
In my view, those distortions
originate from

582
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,920
a variety of places in childhood.

583
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,300
Childhood victimization.

584
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,560
Faulty family relationships.

585
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,160
General psychological distress.

586
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,720
They are not so easily dealt with.

587
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,690
Not without help.

588
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,120
They are not so easily cast aside.

589
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,350
<i>Did you confess because you
felt guilty about the offence?</i>

590
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,180
Maybe.

591
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,980
Maybe, yes.

592
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,640
Or to protect someone?

593
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,880
You see, David,
when I look at this interview...

594
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,480
..like...I can see you've...

595
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,199
..you've no idea
how the murder took place.

596
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,599
You don't even know
if there was a murder.

597
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,779
I can see that you were led
and prompted by the detectives

598
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,120
in a shameful
and unprofessional manner.

599
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,520
It's time to tell the truth, David.

600
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,869
I have here the transcript
of that interview,

601
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,079
dated the 22nd of August 2002.

602
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,640
"Reese - Why was there a washing-up
bowl by the bed, David?"

603
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,799
"- What?"
"- A plastic washing-up bowl."

604
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,109
"I don't know."

605
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:57,719
"What colour was that bowl?"
"Blue?"

606
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,510
"Were you cleaning up the scene,
washing your hands, what?"

607
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:02,199
"I was stoned."

608
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,789
"- So now you were stoned?"
"- I'd been drinking."

609
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:07,949
"So what colour was the bowl?"

610
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:12,069
"Grey? Green? Brown?"

611
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,320
"Green, David, yes."

612
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,080
I think I know
why that bowl was there.

613
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:33,560
And it relates to the modus operandi
of Paul Spector, Peter Baldwin.

614
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,229
Are you sure he killed
all those girls?

615
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,790
Yes, we are.

616
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,720
Why are you protecting him, David?

617
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,000
No-one has any idea
how bad Gortnacull House was.

618
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,840
Only those that were there.

619
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:05,429
- I have some idea.
- No, you fucking don't.

620
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,730
Then tell me.

621
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,920
Tell me, David.
Tell me about the dining room.

622
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,480
Was there morning assemblies?

623
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,119
How do you know about that?

624
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,079
One of my colleagues
was the arresting officer

625
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,560
who put Jensen and
several others in prison.

626
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,469
And they did forensic tests there,

627
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:37,349
and they found the carpet
in that room

628
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:39,920
covered in semen stains.

629
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,140
David?

630
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,160
Is that something
that happened to you?

631
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,049
Did you have to masturbate
in front of other boys,

632
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:56,350
staff?

633
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,889
- Everyone did.
- Peter Baldwin?

634
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:03,280
I said, "Everyone did."

635
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,120
Me, Pretty Boy...

636
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,540
..everyone did,
at one time or another.

637
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,199
Pretty Boy?

638
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,520
- Jensen's name.
- For Spector?

639
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,980
For Baldwin, Spector, whatever.

640
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,360
Jensen always had a favourite.

641
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,159
A boy of about 12 or 13 years of age

642
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,589
that he would single out
for his special attentions.

643
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:41,069
And the tradition was
that when he was leaving,

644
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:43,510
a special boy had to
nominate his successor.

645
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,600
So Jensen and Baldwin
came to our dormitory one night.

646
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,960
Peter was due to leave,
and Jensen made Peter choose.

647
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,600
He could have chose me.

648
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,349
He looked straight at me.
Straight at me.

649
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,380
Jensen looked straight at me.

650
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,520
And I knew Jensen wanted me.
I felt it.

651
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,589
But Peter walked straight past me
and chose another boy.

652
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:29,019
I don't know who, some poor fuck.

653
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,940
I didn't look, I didn't even care.

654
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:36,560
Just as long as
it wasn't me.

655
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:45,269
Being Jensen's favourite
was the worst thing...

656
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:47,760
the worst thing you can imagine.

657
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,660
David...

658
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:59,229
..are you certain
that Baldwin, Paul Spector,

659
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,120
was Jensen's favourite?

660
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,820
For a full year.

661
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,560
Every night and every day
for a full year.

662
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,280
Do you know why your mother
took her own life?

663
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,429
Because my love
wasn't enough for her,

664
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:35,040
enough to...keep her alive.

665
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,720
Whenever I was ill, as a child...

666
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,480
..she'd take me into her bed
and care for me.

667
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,840
And Baldwin would sleep in mine.

668
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,480
And when he left, she was...

669
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,240
..so sad that I slept in there
with her, every night.

670
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,700
Just me and her in the world.

671
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,710
The car lights would sweep across
the ceiling...

672
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,160
..and I'd imagine that...

673
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,120
..we were on a raft together
drifting in the water.

674
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,700
Just me and her in the world
but we had each other.

675
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,040
I still remember her smell,
the smell of her clothes.

676
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,740
On my eighth birthday...

677
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,480
..after he'd left...

678
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,320
she told me that...
he wasn't my father.

679
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,260
That my real father...

680
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,520
..unreal father...

681
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,360
..was a British soldier
who was gone before I was born. Hm.

682
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:08,300
That was her...birthday gift to me.

683
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,170
Ten days later, she was dead.

684
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,800
Were you the one to find her?

685
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,500
It was a school day.

686
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,989
She wasn't there at the gate
to pick me up,

687
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:33,850
so I walked home.

688
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,520
Rang the doorbell,
there was no answer.

689
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,680
But there was a key under the mat,
so...

690
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,680
..so I let myself in.

691
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,100
I shouted out, there was no reply.
The radio was on.

692
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,720
I looked around.

693
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,180
I went upstairs...

694
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,719
..pushed against her bedroom.

695
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,870
There was a...thump
against the door.

696
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,680
So I pushed more until I got in.

697
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,120
And...she was on
the back of the door...

698
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,360
..belts around her neck.

699
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,330
I shouted at her,
but there was no response.

700
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:37,389
I didn't know if
she was dead or alive.

701
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:40,820
I called 999.
The ambulance men came.

702
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,380
They...

703
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,360
..they told me to wait in my room.

704
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,460
I looked out the window and...

705
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,669
..I remember this red blanket
that they used

706
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:56,830
to cover her
when they wheeled her out.

707
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,550
All that day, people came and went

708
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:05,980
and nobody told me
what had happened.

709
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,000
Then later someone said that
she'd "gone to a better place."

710
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,879
I suppose I knew she was dead but...

711
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,680
there was a part of me that
thought maybe she was alive...

712
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,970
..living elsewhere...

713
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,180
..in a better place
because I wasn't there.

714
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,529
The last memory I have of her,

715
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:36,029
she was very angry with me,

716
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:38,809
angry for something I'd done.

717
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,660
I don't know what.

718
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,599
You know you worked
on a suicide helpline

719
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,900
for some years?

720
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,180
No.

721
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,400
You did.

722
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,760
And, of course,
as a bereavement counsellor.

723
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,919
Why were you drawn

724
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,690
to that line of work,
do you think?

725
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,140
Something morbid in me, I suppose.

726
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,720
After my mother died...

727
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:24,109
..I had this...recurring dream.

728
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:25,760
I was lying in a coffin...

729
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,360
..and I was cut up into...

730
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,010
..small chunks.

731
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,429
But there was a nerve
that ran through every piece

732
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:42,320
that was connected to my brain.

733
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,320
That sounds very frightening.

734
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:54,119
<i>Why would he take
the blame, David Alvarez?</i>

735
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,399
<i>Why would he do that
for Spector?</i>

736
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,360
<i>Beyond the debt of gratitude?</i>

737
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,449
<i>It's clear he felt guilty.</i>

738
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:03,249
<i>He was part of it, after all.</i>

739
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:05,729
<i>He wrote long rambling letters
of apology</i>

740
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,639
<i>to Susan Harper's parents
from prison.</i>

741
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,799
<i>In his interviews he seems
very vulnerable...</i>

742
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,219
<i>and suggestible.</i>

743
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:13,199
<i>I guess he's toughened up
in prison,</i>

744
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,229
<i>but I wonder</i>

745
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:18,989
<i>if he didn't get off
on it in some way at the time.</i>

746
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:20,859
He seemed very flattered
by the detectives'

747
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,719
"boys will be boys" bullshit.

748
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,789
And, suddenly, he was the centre
of attention, a kind of celebrity.

749
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:29,919
Oh. Have you spoken to Chris George?

750
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,249
Is he going to want
a Met officer to sit in on any

751
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:34,689
further interviews regarding
the Harper murder?

752
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:36,709
He's happy for you
to represent the Met,

753
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:38,509
and he said he'll back us

754
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:40,669
if we reopen the Alvarez
investigation.

755
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:43,119
<i>That's great news.</i>

756
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,819
<i>We're seeing Spector tomorrow
to put the new evidence</i>

757
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,309
<i>from the lock-up to him.</i>
When are you back?

758
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:51,129
<i>First thing. I'll go straight to
the Serious Crime Suite.</i>

759
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:53,900
- Good work, Tom.
<i>- Let's hope so.</i>

760
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,590
<i>Detective Superintendent Gibson.</i>

761
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,949
<i>This interview is being recorded</i>

762
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:04,410
<i>at the Down Serious Crime Suite.</i>

763
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:07,049
<i>The date is the 16th of May 2012</i>

764
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:10,069
<i>and the time,
by my watch, is 1400.</i>

765
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:13,339
<i>I'm Detective Sergeant Anderson,
and the other police officer present</i>

766
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:15,749
<i>is Detective Superintendent
Gibson.</i>

767
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,099
Can you please state your
full name and date of birth?

768
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:22,239
Peter Paul Spector,
25th of May 1979.

769
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,600
- And also present is?
- Sean Healy, solicitor.

770
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:28,079
And at the conclusion
of the interview

771
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:31,429
<i>I'll give a notice of how
you can obtain a copy of the tapes.</i>

772
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:33,179
<i>You do not have to say anything,</i>

773
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:35,589
<i>but I must caution you if you
do not mention when questioned</i>

774
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:37,199
<i>something you later
rely on in court,</i>

775
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,600
<i>it may harm your defence.</i>

776
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:41,109
<i>If you do say anything,
it may be given in evidence.</i>

777
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:42,869
<i>Do you understand the caution?</i>

778
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:44,719
<i>Yes.</i>

779
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,159
<i>We have reason to believe
that you rented</i>

780
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:51,829
a lock-up as a storage unit
in the name of Peter Baldwin.

781
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:55,460
I'm showing a lease agreement
for that lock-up.

782
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,660
Is that your signature
on the document?

783
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:10,229
For the benefit of the tape,

784
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:12,569
Paul Spector has declined
to answer the question.

785
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:13,949
So, in that lock-up,

786
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:15,909
along with a car
we believe you stole,

787
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:18,769
we found a number of items
that we'd like you to account for.

788
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:21,309
Now, we believe that
these...documents,

789
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:24,469
these diaries or journals,
are your work.

790
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:27,119
I'm showing exhibit ME369,

791
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,090
which is a journal,
and also

792
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:33,220
a copy of the contents
of the journal.

793
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:38,789
Now...are you able to identify
the subject of this journal,

794
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:41,830
a woman with the initials RW?

795
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,799
- No.
- This is pointless.

796
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,999
My client is undergoing assessment

797
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,249
because he is suffering
retrograde amnesia

798
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,469
which covers
all autobiographical memory

799
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:58,920
for a period of six years or so.

800
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,479
Then perhaps you recognise this man?

801
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,389
I'm showing a photograph
of a male person.

802
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:06,879
What's this?

803
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,969
We believe he was with you
in Gortnacull Children's Home

804
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:12,404
and that you met him again

805
00:56:12,405 --> 00:56:15,229
in 2002,
in London,

806
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:16,619
which is a period that falls

807
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:19,399
outside the timeframe
of your purported amnesia.

808
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,929
What has this got to do with
the contents of the lock-up?

809
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:23,760
Before my client answers...

810
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:28,029
..could you please explain
the relevance of this photograph?

811
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:31,259
This man is, at present, serving
a life sentence for a murder,

812
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:33,339
a murder he committed in 2002.

813
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:36,419
Even then, I'm sorry, but it falls
outside the scope of this interview.

814
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,960
The murder of this woman. I'm showing
a photograph of the female victim.

815
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:48,340
DCI Eastwood has just entered
the room at 14:03.

816
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:54,349
Paul Spector,
I am further arresting you

817
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:56,400
for the murder of Susan Harper

818
00:56:56,930 --> 00:56:59,099
at Flat 16 Thornton <i>Rise,</i>

819
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:04,039
<i>SW16 3CV, on the
18th of the eighth, 2002.</i>

820
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,809
I must remind you
that you are still under caution.

821
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:08,719
I insist this interview
be suspended.

822
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,479
I must take instruction
from Mr Spector.

823
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,409
Do you recognise this man?
Do you know his name?

824
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:14,830
- David Alvarez.
- This interview stops now.

825
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:19,109
Interview has been suspended
at 14:04

826
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:21,480
so that Paul Spector can consult
with his solicitor.

827
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,230
Who the fuck is David Alvarez?

828
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,919
Just as they've said,

829
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,669
someone I knew
when I was a child

830
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:45,869
and then again
in London in 2002.

831
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:48,669
A convicted murderer?

832
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:50,720
- Yes.
- What is going on?

833
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,560
The police have been clever.

834
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:03,550
They have something on me
that I can actually remember.

835
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:22,160

1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,876
<i>I've been brought in from the Metropolitan Police</i>

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,670
<i>to lead a review into the investigation of the murder of Alice Monroe.</i>

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,311
There's been a shooting in a house a mile away. A car was stopped just along there.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,200
<i>He had things entirely under his control,</i>

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,239
<i>which leads me to think that this was not his first murder.</i>

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,835
I'm staying at the Hilton, room 203.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,038
Go back to your reviews, Stella. I don't want the two murders linked.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,431
Ned Callan, Belfast Chronicle. Can I have a word?

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,956
- Not at the moment, no.
- Not even off the record?

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,839
There's no such thing, as you well know.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,711
Failure to see the crimes are linked. That's the thing that will allow the killer to strike again.

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,276
Perhaps she did go stay with her sister.

00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,473
DS James Olson. Just after 2150 hours a car was stopped in the vicinity of the Falls Road

15
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,393
because it was being driven erratically.

16
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,553
A search revealed two concealed firearms and a quantity of ammunition.

17
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,757
I've reason to believe this man Terry Mclnturff

18
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,957
was involved in the murder of Michael Lockwood

19
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,112
in the Shankhill area earlier this evening.

20
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,272
- Empty your mouth.
- Screw you.

21
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,994
Empty your mouth.

22
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,551
Screw you.

23
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,189
- Spit it out!

24
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,872
Spit it out!

25
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,355
- Get him back in the cell.
- Oi, you, come on! Come on!

26
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,599
Come on!

27
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,831
- We need some assistance here.

28
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,911
- We need to obtain all clothes and footwear.

29
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,156
- Right.
- Come on!

30
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,397
I wasn't sure this is what you meant.

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,832
It's what I meant.

32
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,312
I should take a shower.

33
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,437
No need.

34
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,552
I like it.

35
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,759
Should I take your number?

36
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,510
..<i>two guns seized following last night's murder in West Belfast.</i>

37
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,833
<i>Today, the chairman of the Independent Policing Executive Morgan Monroe</i>

38
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,400
<i>issued this statement:</i>

39
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,156
<i>The people of Belfast would be horrified by last night's shooting.</i>

40
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,872
<i>These attacks leave behind a trail of suffering, misery, and hurt in their wake.</i>

41
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,920
<i>Meanwhile, the hunt for the killer of Alice Monroe continues.</i>

42
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,233
<i>Aaron Monroe, who has been helping the police with their inquiries, spoke to our reporter.</i>

43
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,520
<i>We're very grateful that the police have finally released Alice's body to her family.</i>

44
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,517
<i>And although we were separated at the time of her death we both remained very close friends.</i>

45
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,993
- Hey!
- Hey.

46
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,152
There's fresh coffee there.

47
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,832
Sorry, we have to go.

48
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,592
You look tired. Did you have a busy night?

49
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,953
Quite busy yeah ,.

50
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,670
- Let me take this for you.
- Don't worry, I'm fine. Don't fuss.

51
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,720
Right, grab your things, you two. Come on, let's go.

52
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,392
Come on.

53
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,592
Thought this might interest you.

54
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,632
This was last night?

55
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,915
I was at the hotel dining room, about to eat.

56
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,198
Callan came in and sat down, uninvited, at my table.

57
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,511
I didn't see a photographer.

58
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,149
- How did he know you were staying there?
- I don't know.

59
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,834
What did you say to him?

60
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,196
- I asked him to leave.
- You should have told me.

61
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,430
Told you what?

62
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,796
All meetings with journalists have to be on the record.

63
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,749
It wasn't a meeting. He doorstepped me. I said, "Go away." There's nothing there.

64
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,793
- What did he want with you?
- He wanted to hear about the review.

65
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,749
He wanted to talk about the murder. I refused to discuss either.

66
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,394
I've a meeting with the Independent Policing Executive this morning.

67
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,999
This...has done nothing to make my job easier.

68
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,754
Keep that. One for the archives.

69
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,352
<i>Where she went, who she saw, what she did, were no longer any of my business.</i>

70
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,390
<i>I can't help you with any of that.</i>

71
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,031
<i>You know, she seemed to call you often enough. Twice on the day she died.</i>

72
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,999
<i>- Probably to bitch and moan.
- Bitch and moan?</i>

73
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,914
<i>Definitely not to share any details of her new life.</i>

74
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,673
<i>She moved on?</i>

75
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,834
<i>Well, if you think getting a tattoo and dressing like a slut is moving on, then, yeah.</i>

76
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,798
<i>You disapproved?</i>

77
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,270
<i>It wasn't something I'd let her do when we were together.</i>

78
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,433
<i>She'd need your permission to do something like that,</i>

79
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,592
<i>when you were married?</i>

80
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,352
<i>I think I'd like to leave now.</i>

81
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,318
These are all the prescription drugs gathered at the crime scene?

82
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,472
Yes, ma'am.

83
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,751
No sign of any illegal drug use with regard to Alice Monroe?

84
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,072
No, ma'am. None.

85
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,159
Did it occur to you that Aaron Monroe was clucking during his interviews?

86
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,592
At the time, no.

87
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,191
- He was very on edge.
- Looks like a coke head to me.

88
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,915
Worth following up with the action manager, I think.

89
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,032
- Thanks, Mary.

90
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,514
Fewer people have been killed or seriously injured on our roads.

91
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,071
The levels of sectarian crime have reduced over the last year.

92
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,632
We have seized more illegal drugs, arrested more drug offenders -

93
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,555
and this has been delivered despite increasing economic cutbacks,

94
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,315
and increasing threats against our officers.

95
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,312
<i>- Bacon and Day Solicitors.</i>
- Hi, is Sarah Kay there?

96
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,472
<i>She's not in the office today.</i>

97
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,839
- Do you know why? <i>- Who is this, please?</i>

98
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,914
- I just need to speak to her. <i>- Shall I put you through to her voicemail?</i>

99
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,751
No. Thanks for your help.

100
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,359
Kevin McSwain. The solicitor representing Terry Mclnturff and Jonas Dylan.

101
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,153
Why was their car stopped?

102
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,199
It was being driven erratically close to the scene of a crime.

103
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,353
- You have witness statements to that effect?
- We do.

104
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,751
I should like copies of those witness statements.

105
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,751
OK.

106
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,277
I also want a written list of every question that you intend to ask.

107
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,638
What? So you and your clients can cook up some crazy cover story?

108
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,358
Get real.

109
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:30,276
I understand that you forcibly removed chewing gum from my client Terry Mclnturff.

110
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,875
For his own safety. Was worried he might choke.

111
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,792
Well, it was, in fact, nicotine gum, as prescribed by his GP.

112
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,316
So he's entitled to a supply while he's in custody,

113
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,517
just as he would be any other prescription drug.

114
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,514
And you're in breach of custody regulations by withholding it.

115
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,716
- So make a complaint.
- I intend to.

116
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,676
The Lockwood house was heavily fortified.

117
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,435
Two of the three men arrested were known to the police.

118
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:59,954
So erm...there's no indication that distant Republicans were involved in the murder.

119
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,520
None whatsoever.

120
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,596
This was a cold-blooded killing, which we are, at present, treating as drugs-related.

121
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,391
This is the location of the shooting.

122
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,280
It's where the car you were travelling in was stopped.

123
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,035
Explain to me where'd you been, tell me where you were going.

124
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,760
After advice, my client will not be answering any questions.

125
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,559
- Let him answer that.
- I've told you.

126
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,792
- After advice, my...
- Then let him answer that for himself!

127
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,956
Do you know this man? Michael Lockwood.

128
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,995
My client will not be answering any questions.

129
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,790
- Look at the photographs, please.
- As you well know,

130
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,476
showing gruesome photographs to suspects is a violation of their human rights.

131
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,678
Four shots in the back in front of his wife, his son.

132
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,954
It was very brave, very bold.

133
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,596
You had two handguns with you. Why?

134
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,199
Cos you had a pre-meditated plan to kill Michael Lockwood.

135
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,477
He could be enticed from his house by Rory McNaught.

136
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,553
After advice, my client will not be answering any questions.

137
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,871
Michael Lockwood was well known to us, Terry.

138
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,351
What happened between you two? Did a drug deal go bad?

139
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,355
Dispute over turf?

140
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,991
After advice, my client will not be answering any questions.

141
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,872
Don't give me that look, Terry.

142
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,515
That bullshit only works on intelligent people.

143
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,672
You took your phone with you, Terry.

144
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:35,277
Cell tower triangulation puts you precisely here at the time of the shooting.

145
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,870
What a dazzling display of stupidity.

146
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,834
I know...where you live.

147
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,239
Like I've never heard that before.

148
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,676
I am assured by the officer in question that the journalist simply approached her

149
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,400
in the dining room of her hotel, uninvited.

150
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,309
She refused to discuss her presence in Belfast

151
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,475
and refused to answer any questions about her involvement in the Alice Monroe review.

152
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,632
He left empty-handed.

153
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,600
You're gonna see Auntie Sarah. Yes, we are. Yes, we are.

154
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,833
Sarah!

155
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,718
Sarah?

156
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,912
Sarah?

157
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,472
Sarah?

158
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,674
It's past two. I've been calling you.

159
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,198
Sarah?

160
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,992
Sarah?

161
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,438
- What's your name, caller?

162
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,436
<i>- I'm Marion.</i>
- I'm Samantha.

163
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,954
- Is that your baby, Marion? <i>- Yes.</i>

164
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,520
Is he all right?

165
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,559
<i>It's a girl. Yes. It's not the baby. It's my sister.</i>

166
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,396
- What about her, Marion? <i>- She won't wake up, she won't wake up.</i>

167
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,632
- Where are you calling from? <i>- Her house.</i>

168
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,077
And the number you called on, that's the house telephone, is it?

169
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,118
<i>Yes.</i>

170
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,636
Good. Help is already on its way.

171
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,671
Are you with your sister now, Marion?

172
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,080
<i>- I'm in the hall.</i>
- Where is your sister?

173
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,835
<i>She's in the bedroom. Please help me.</i>

174
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,550
Help is already on its way. It's gonna be there very soon.

175
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:11,638
Any cars out near 3 Saville Road, Bravo Tango Six, Seven Echo Delta? Come in.

176
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,120
Oh, Jesus.

177
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,638
<i>Ambulance control? I've had a report of a body of a female at that location.</i>

178
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,199
Uniform from Alpha Papa Two One. we are five minutes away and will respond.

179
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,116
I can hear the siren, Marion. Can you see them?

180
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,392
Marion, can you see them yet?

181
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,877
<i>No.</i>

182
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,509
They're right there, Marion. Can you see them?

183
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,750
<i>- It's OK, madam. Come with me.
- Yes, they're here.</i>

184
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,116
OK, Marion. They'll take care of you now.

185
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,432
You can put the phone down.

186
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,119
<i>Come with me, please.</i>

187
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,672
- Hello, Police, how can I help you?

188
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,112
That's it, madam. This way.

189
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,956
- Uniform from Alpha Papa Nine. <i>- Go ahead.</i>

190
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,909
I'm in the upstairs front bedroom. No sign of any intruder.

191
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,276
<i>- Understood.</i>
- There's a dead female.

192
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,758
It looks suspicious.

193
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,434
Is it clear to go in?

194
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,718
Erm...there's nothing you can do.

195
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,077
Stone, let's get a cordon into place, OK? I need it as wide as possible.

196
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,551
Use that wall, use that house, block off the road in both directions.

197
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,758
You - make sure nobody gets in the house. Keep those people back, OK?

198
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,392
You all right?

199
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,435
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't get you on the phone.

200
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,035
- Called your office.

201
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,192
Everything's laid on for tonight.

202
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,954
I want you to cancel.

203
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,358
What?

204
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,274
There's too much going on. Too much attention focused on you.

205
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,830
- I thought you were dealing with that.
- I am.

206
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,118
But you need to play your part. Your ex-wife has been murdered.

207
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,714
There's a funeral to get through.

208
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,351
Here you are lounging on the car like you haven't a care in the world.

209
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,955
People expect you to say the right things, show remorse.

210
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,237
Dad, it's too late to cancel tonight.

211
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,474
Our guests are expecting to be entertained. They're expecting a party.

212
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,792
Throw that away and get in the car.

213
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,752
I backed you in there, Jim, on the understanding you would clear my son's name.

214
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,757
- I know, Morgan.
- Well, make that announcement...today.

215
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,352
Burns.

216
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,992
- What?

217
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,798
Garrett, is your car here? There's been another murder.

218
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,276
I think my daughter's here. I think they brought her up here.

219
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,751
I'll be with you in a wee second. Do you want to just take a seat?

220
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,599
Where did I go wrong?

221
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,800
Paul.

222
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,112
<i>- Were you sleeping?</i>
- Yes.

223
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,432
<i>Don't forget this afternoon.</i>

224
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,995
- What? <i>- Four o'clock.</i>

225
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,552
Oh, yeah. OK.

226
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,918
<i>Sorry. Just...one minute.</i>

227
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,312
- Hello? <i>- I have to be back here at nine.</i>

228
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,472
OK.

229
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,472
<i>I have to go.</i>

230
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,431
Get back. Get back, please.

231
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,154
Go back. Down the street.

232
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,874
- Who were the first attending officers?
- We were, ma'am.

233
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,157
- Did you go inside?
- Ferrington did.

234
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,312
Ferrington?

235
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,151
- You've been in?
- Yes, ma'am.

236
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,232
- Tell me.
- Suspected homicide.

237
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,074
- White professional female in her 30s?
- Yes, ma'am.

238
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,596
- Strangulation marks?
- I think so.

239
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,878
- Where was the body located?
- In the upstairs front bedroom.

240
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,511
- Where in the bedroom?
- On the bed.

241
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,038
Covered or uncovered?

242
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,192
Er...partly covered, I think.

243
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,672
- Thank you.
- She was a solicitor.

244
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,998
What? Was she known to you?

245
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,992
Yes, ma'am.

246
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,192
She's not in any pain.

247
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,637
She's getting help breathing,

248
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:06,192
and we'll do an X-ray of her chest and an echocardiogram of her heart.

249
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,958
We'll need to do some blood tests for infection.

250
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,392
Can I touch her?

251
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,191
- Jim, it's Stella Gibson. <i>- I can see you.</i>

252
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,032
Let her in.

253
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,957
I have real worries it's the same guy.

254
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,192
How on earth can you say that when no-one's been in yet?

255
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:20,278
Two uniformed officers attended a break-in on Friday evening at the same property.

256
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,320
Female solicitor living alone came home to find there'd been an intruder.

257
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,235
Who'd left some items of underwear and her vibrator on her bed.

258
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,800
What?

259
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,072
The same officers attended today.

260
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,112
Victim's name is Sarah Kay.

261
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,718
Strangled, posed.

262
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,354
- Has to be the same guy.
- No, I'm sorry, but...

263
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,957
Was she not advised to vacate the property while the investigations were going on?

264
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:53,149
There were no investigations. The victim herself decided not to pursue it.

265
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,152
Make me SIO.

266
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,600
I have the rank, I have the experience. I'm here.

267
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,752
And I could be made available.

268
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,955
This is the third murder in three months, Jim.

269
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,797
If we don't stop him he will kill again.

270
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,352
You OK?

271
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,715
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to ask you a few questions.

272
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,157
I'm Detective Superintendent Gibson, I'm acting SIO here.

273
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,516
Sheldon Schwartz, crime scene manager.

274
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,878
- Who's been in so far?
- The medical officer's in there now.

275
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:40,034
I want it videoed, sketched and photographed before anybody else goes in.

276
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,192
- Yes, ma'am.
- Who found her?

277
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,752
Her sister made the initial call.

278
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,398
- What's her name?

279
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,676
Marion.

280
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,834
We need to get her clothing before there's any more cross-contamination.

281
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,117
- Handle it sensitively.
- Right.

282
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,952
- Is a house-to-house underway?
- Yes, ma'am.

283
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:22,951
The schematic stage of drawing generally occurs at this age, seven to nine.

284
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,637
They start drawing what they are thinking rather than just what they see.

285
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,518
When I asked Olivia what she had drawn,

286
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,640
she told me it was a princess who had stabbed herself and died.

287
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,638
She hasn't been sleeping very well.

288
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,553
She looks tired.

289
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,919
Well, Paul's work is with bereaved people, of course.

290
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,037
And my work has its ups and downs,

291
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,318
but we're always very careful what we say in front of the kids.

292
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,872
Perhaps she intuited something.

293
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,112
Perhaps.

294
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,632
That's Professor Reed Smith. She's the pathologist.

295
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,676
Ask her to join us at the command vehicle.

296
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,752
Hi.

297
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,992
How you doing?

298
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,354
Perhaps you can do me a favour. Collect some things from my hotel room.

299
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,032
OK, make a list.

300
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,590
Thank you for calling us in. We really appreciate your concern for Livvy.

301
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,956
- Daddy!
- Hey!

302
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,191
I didn't know you were here.

303
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,113
I'm not here.

304
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,511
Yes, you are, Daddy. I can see you.

305
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:52,232
Under floorboards, in the loft, behind bath panels, inside water cisterns.

306
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,877
Check every rubbish and dustbin.

307
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:59,512
Check for lifestyle indicators - drugs, sexual fetishes, magazines.

308
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,434
Anything unusual or significant.

309
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,035
Access will be tightly controlled, so everybody in oversuits, gloves, masks, overshoes.

310
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,157
Stepping plates, where applicable.

311
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,118
Please, everyone. Everyone, listen.

312
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,751
No discussions relating this crime to any other recent murder.

313
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,712
Keep your thoughts to yourselves.

314
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,198
From the body temperature and the degree of rigor mortis,

315
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,273
I'd say the post-mortem interval is 12 to 14 hours.

316
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,479
Cause of death?

317
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,512
Asphyxiation, ligature.

318
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,272
Her nails look newly painted.

319
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,672
Yes, they do.

320
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,590
Victims of strangulation often urinate and defecate at the point of death.

321
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,880
- Yes.
- I'd expect more mess.

322
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:10,353
He washed her. He washed her and he dried her.

323
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,672
He washed and dried the bedding too.

324
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,996
And then he put her back to bed.

325
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,633
What is it, Mummy? What happened?

326
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,792
There's been an accident, I think.

327
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,672
- Is someone dead?
- I don't know, darling.

328
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,513
<i>How long was he with her after he killed her?</i>

329
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,992
It must have been hours.

330
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,471
Do you think her hair's been clipped?

331
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,352
Where?

332
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,998
There.

333
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,154
Firearm residue found on the hands and clothes of Mclnturff and Dylan.

334
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,431
Fibres from Mclnturff's jacket pocket match those found on the Glock 17.

335
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,671
Bullets retrieved from the body of the victim

336
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,753
match the ammunition found in Rory McNaught's car.

337
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,516
- The man from the PPS he say yes.
- What to?

338
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,192
Yes, sir, I will.

339
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,716
Dylan and Mclnturff with murder, McNaught as an accessory.

340
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,755
Here, break the news to McSwain.

341
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,352
McSwain.

342
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,396
Got the initial lab report.

343
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,712
You're worried about nicotine gum.

344
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,752
You OK?

345
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,032
One of my friends has been killed.

346
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,592
An accident?

347
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,356
No, not an accident.

348
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,079
- I got your things, ma'am.
- Oh, right. Thank you.

349
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,040
I've been thinking I should report myself.

350
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,717
We should never have left her alone that night. We failed her utterly.

351
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,394
Report your partner as well?

352
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,674
You have reported it...to me.

353
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,392
Let me think about it.

354
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,270
I'll decide what action to take tomorrow.

355
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,712
Yes, ma'am.

356
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:04,390
I'm Detective Superintendent Gibson. I'm leading this inquiry.

357
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,552
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

358
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,757
Did you happen to notice your sister's nails?

359
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,834
- No.
- They look freshly painted.

360
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,754
There's not much in the way of nail varnish in the house.

361
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,194
She hardly ever wore it.

362
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,352
Red nail varnish?

363
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,999
Not since she was 16, maybe.

364
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,352
I'm very sorry for your loss.

365
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:37,190
<i>Police have launched an investigation into a suspicious death at an address in Belfast.</i>

366
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,956
<i>- Detectives have yet to release...</i>
- Paul.

367
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,952
<i>But have confirmed that a post-mortem...</i>

368
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,476
- Paul. <i>- ..is due to take place later today.</i>

369
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,439
<i>This discovery comes just weeks after...</i>

370
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,752
Thanks.

371
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,999
What are you doing here? How did you get through the cordon?

372
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,949
- I'm a police officer, remember?
- Not part of this investigation.

373
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,991
Why did you give me your number if you don't want to see me again?

374
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,916
It was a mistake. I thought I was good at reading people. I'm sorry.

375
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,392
It seems I've read you wrong.

376
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,796
DS Olson signing out.

377
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,953
- Jimmy, what were you doing in there?
- Delivering a message.

378
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,237
To Detective Superintendent Gibson?

379
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,113
- Are you charging Mclnturff and co?
- No comment.

380
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,754
Fine.

381
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,709
Tell your boss from me to stop saying the shooting's drugs related.

382
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,637
Why? Do you know something different?

383
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,718
Who's dead in there?

384
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,349
- Do you know something different?
- Maybe.

385
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,199
All I know is...

386
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:05,593
white female, early 30s, solicitor at Bacon and Day.

387
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,672
Your turn.

388
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,916
- Is that all right for you?
- Yes.

389
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,072
- That all right?
- Yeah.

390
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,992
<i>I got you something.</i>

391
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:15,195
Because your teacher said you were trying really hard at school.

392
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,632
Come here. I'll put it on.

393
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,071
- Thank you, Daddy.
- OK.

394
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,430
Katie.

395
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,672
Paul said I could download some music from his computer.

396
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,718
If it's not a good time I can...

397
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,349
- I'm just about to go to work.
- Oh.

398
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,833
OK.

399
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,153
- Do you not have an umbrella or something?
- No.

400
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,279
Jesus, come in, until it eases off at least.

401
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,990
- Jimmy. <i>- I ran into Ned Callan.</i>

402
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,311
<i>- He had quite a story to tell.</i>
- I'm working.

403
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,551
<i>- Aye. Sorry.</i>
- Give me five minutes.

404
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,792
- Come in, gentlemen.
- Good evening. Good to see you.

405
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,952
Take a seat.

406
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,511
Mr Rossmeisl and Mr Lang are here.

407
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,639
- Roger.
- Hey.

408
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,077
Artur. How good to see you. Now, sit down. Relax.

409
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,677
I'd like you to meet the girls of Monroe Air.

410
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,513
Come on.

411
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,876
A glass of champagne, please.

412
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,032
- You're very kind.

413
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,192
Thank you very much.

414
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,272
Is that for her?

415
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:30,149
She's 15. She's underage.

416
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,232
Don't let her stay too long.

417
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,152
Thanks.

418
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,078
<i>Hi, it's Rob. What's the story?</i>

419
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,197
- Not crime-related at all. <i>- Right.</i>

420
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,352
- Nothing to do with drugs. <i>- OK.</i>

421
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:11,310
Apparently, Michael Lockwood's been fucking Terry Mclnturff's wife.

422
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,711
<i>- You're joking?</i>
- For the past seven years.

423
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,270
<i>- No.</i>
- Could be the father of Terry's kids.

424
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,279
- Mclnturff just recently found out. <i>- It's beautiful.</i>

425
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,272
His anger knew no bounds.

426
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,636
<i>- Shit, I've gotta go. Talk later.</i>
- OK.

427
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,393
Daddy!

428
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,155
- Daddy, Daddy!

429
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,432
Daddy!

430
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,632
Thank you.

431
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:18,276
She has a high level of chorionic gonadotropin in her blood.

432
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,398
- What's that?
- I'm thinking she was pregnant.

433
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,957
Oh, Jesus.

434
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,998
She's not really showing, so...

435
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,152
It might be very early stages.

436
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,515
- Do you have kids?
- No.

437
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,070
- You?
- Two girls.

438
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,992
She's erm...ready when you are.

439
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,834
You may see what looks like bruising on her face.

440
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,199
It's not bruising. It's just something that happens when the heart stops.

441
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,632
Are you ready?

442
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,390
Is this the body of your daughter Sarah Kay?

443
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,712
My baby.

444
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,192
My baby.

445
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,032
My baby.

446
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,272
Beautiful baby.

447
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,880
Can I touch her?

448
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,152
Yes, of course.

449
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,156
I bet you sit in here playing air guitar.

450
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,152
Wishing you were black.

451
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,992
Dancing all alone.

452
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,480
I was only joking.

453
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,470
- God, you're strong.
- And you're a thief.

454
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,678
- Give it back.
- What?

455
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,832
You know what.

456
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,112
What are you doing?

457
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,880
No! Get off of me!

458
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,792
You're hurting me.

459
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,160
I wasn't gonna take it.

460
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,471
You had taken it.

461
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,632
I wasn't gonna keep it.

462
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,352
I was just gonna ask about it.

463
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,632
- Ask what?
- Fuck you!

464
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,991
- You hurt my wrist.
- Ask what?

465
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,152
Nothing.

466
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:29,310
It's my mother's hair. It's all I have of her.

467
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,192
It smells fresh.

468
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,392
I wash it sometimes.

469
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,872
I'm sorry I hurt you.

470
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,036
What can I do to make it up to you?

471
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,752
Kiss it better.

472
00:57:07,305 --> 00:58:07,489

1
00:00:00,047 --> 00:00:02,674
Who's that? Who is that?

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,902
Just a patient. Road traffic accident.

3
00:00:05,206 --> 00:00:07,131
We're only holding two cards, Stella.

4
00:00:07,251 --> 00:00:10,998
One, we have him two, we
have her and she's alive,

5
00:00:11,006 --> 00:00:13,349
the rest is a disaster.

6
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:16,109
- Do you have a friend called Daisy?
- Why?

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:17,942
There's something about her online,

8
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:19,909
how she met Daddy one time.

9
00:00:19,909 --> 00:00:21,709
Am I being interviewed under caution?

10
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:24,669
- Yes, you are.
- I knew that Rose was in that boot

11
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:26,288
and I needed to get to her.

12
00:00:26,323 --> 00:00:28,341
And what about Mr Spector's life?

13
00:00:28,549 --> 00:00:30,829
Did you not have a duty to protect that?

14
00:00:32,988 --> 00:00:34,541
I need some help in here!

15
00:00:34,794 --> 00:00:35,953
Rose, what are you doing?

16
00:00:35,957 --> 00:00:37,333
- I want to go home.
- You can't.

17
00:00:37,364 --> 00:00:38,647
I want to go home!

18
00:00:38,722 --> 00:00:40,254
A man has come forward

19
00:00:40,272 --> 00:00:42,777
having seen Spector's
photograph on the news.

20
00:00:42,827 --> 00:00:44,725
He says Spector looks
like a man who rents

21
00:00:44,741 --> 00:00:46,756
a lock-up from him in East Belfast,

22
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,909
under the name Baldwin.

23
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:51,950
We've just landed a not
uninteresting little case.

24
00:00:52,117 --> 00:00:53,521
The Belfast Strangler.

25
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:54,692
You stay away from him!

26
00:00:54,726 --> 00:00:56,568
I haven't been near him!
You need to get a grip!

27
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,427
You're obsessed, it's pathetic!

28
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:00,922
Who's pathetic now?!

29
00:01:00,955 --> 00:01:02,154
Ma'am.

30
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:04,956
Hello, Daddy.

31
00:01:05,017 --> 00:01:06,498
It's me, Olivia.

32
00:01:06,726 --> 00:01:07,991
Why are you so big?

33
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:11,387
And you, you look different, older.

34
00:01:11,712 --> 00:01:13,232
What's happening to me?

35
00:01:14,706 --> 00:01:15,982
More victims?

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,074

Are you in pain?

42
00:03:48,446 --> 00:03:49,662
Here.

43
00:04:26,314 --> 00:04:28,154
We've seen fragments before,

44
00:04:28,154 --> 00:04:30,622
bits of pages that
didn't burn in the car.

45
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,891
Enough to confirm that
he kept journals, but

46
00:04:33,252 --> 00:04:34,795
nothing like this.

47
00:04:35,474 --> 00:04:38,412
Nothing so extensive,
nothing so detailed.

48
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:42,763
I'd put it to Spector that between

49
00:04:42,786 --> 00:04:45,305
the strangulation of Rose and the

50
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:46,875
murder of Fiona Gallagher,

51
00:04:46,903 --> 00:04:49,074
that there must have been other attacks.

52
00:04:49,838 --> 00:04:51,609
He said that there
were no other attacks,

53
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,914
that Fiona Gallagher
was his first murder.

54
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:57,030
During that gap in time, he

55
00:04:57,402 --> 00:05:01,148
suggested that he always
had a "project" to work on.

56
00:05:02,524 --> 00:05:04,314
Are these those "projects"?

57
00:05:05,354 --> 00:05:06,614
A.S.

58
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:11,874
Might live in the Holylands area,

59
00:05:12,302 --> 00:05:14,172
who might be a journalist...

60
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:17,413
... who seems to wake up late every day

61
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:19,095
and skip breakfast.

62
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:22,979
Who wears a cream robe after her bath

63
00:05:23,545 --> 00:05:27,080
and sometimes doesn't completely
close her bedroom curtains.

64
00:05:29,143 --> 00:05:32,057
Or, R.W...

65
00:05:32,514 --> 00:05:34,992
who cycles to the
university most days off,

66
00:05:35,004 --> 00:05:36,851
somewhere in the Lisburn Road.

67
00:05:37,573 --> 00:05:41,029
Always brings her lunch with her
and eats in the botanic gardens.

68
00:05:42,012 --> 00:05:44,076
Who has clear, pale skin,

69
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:45,824
wears close-fitting clothes

70
00:05:45,857 --> 00:05:49,392
and walks with a short
stride that Spector likes.

71
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:56,550
Where on the continuum of his
violence do these journals fit?

72
00:05:58,198 --> 00:06:00,850
Are they just fantasies
that sustain him,

73
00:06:00,923 --> 00:06:02,526
feed his appetites?

74
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,885
Or are they a record...

75
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,842
... of nine more murders?

76
00:06:10,474 --> 00:06:12,010
What time of day is it?

77
00:06:12,274 --> 00:06:14,096
Morning, afternoon, night?

78
00:06:15,778 --> 00:06:17,059
Morning.

79
00:06:17,394 --> 00:06:18,591
Where are we?

80
00:06:21,194 --> 00:06:22,953
Belfast General Hospital.

81
00:06:24,394 --> 00:06:26,421
Can you remember the name of your nurse?

82
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,226
Kiera.

83
00:06:34,354 --> 00:06:36,560
Are you married, or
do you have a partner?

84
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,794
I'm married.

85
00:06:39,354 --> 00:06:41,721
Can you remember any
other family members?

86
00:06:44,746 --> 00:06:47,925
Sally Ann has a father, John,

87
00:06:48,935 --> 00:06:51,074
and a mother, Carol.

88
00:06:51,307 --> 00:06:53,354
We call her Cici.

89
00:06:53,354 --> 00:06:54,808
And what about you?

90
00:06:58,104 --> 00:06:59,181
Me?

91
00:06:59,394 --> 00:07:00,884
Do you have any family?

92
00:07:02,394 --> 00:07:03,625
No.

93
00:07:03,936 --> 00:07:05,114
Why is that?

94
00:07:07,098 --> 00:07:08,447
My mother died.

95
00:07:09,374 --> 00:07:11,011
And what about your father?

96
00:07:13,596 --> 00:07:15,472
When I was growing up, he was known as

97
00:07:15,505 --> 00:07:16,804
Peter Baldwin.

98
00:07:17,874 --> 00:07:21,870
I thought that man was my father,

99
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:24,039
till he left us.

100
00:07:25,277 --> 00:07:27,013
My mother told me that

101
00:07:27,429 --> 00:07:29,410
he wasn't my real father, he was...

102
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:32,013
just a man.

103
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:36,547
When did you become Paul Spector?

104
00:07:38,954 --> 00:07:40,270
Erm...

105
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:42,956
just before I met Sally Ann.

106
00:07:44,471 --> 00:07:46,052
And why did you change?

107
00:07:49,055 --> 00:07:50,370
Wanted a...

108
00:07:50,674 --> 00:07:52,073
clean start.

109
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:54,770
- New life.
- Why's that?

110
00:07:56,663 --> 00:07:57,795
Not sure.

111
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,246
Has that new life worked for you?

112
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:16,196
The sheer volume of garments
suggests there were very many

113
00:08:16,224 --> 00:08:18,360
fetish burglaries at that time.

114
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:20,563
His journals talk of...

115
00:08:21,551 --> 00:08:23,314
... climbing scaffolding,

116
00:08:23,434 --> 00:08:26,145
finding windows open, doors unlocked,

117
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:27,749
alarms not set.

118
00:08:29,314 --> 00:08:32,033
I took this photograph to be of a woman.

119
00:08:33,074 --> 00:08:34,863
On closer inspection...

120
00:08:35,712 --> 00:08:37,488
it's clear it's a mannequin.

121
00:08:39,114 --> 00:08:40,745
And these pictures of him.

122
00:08:43,794 --> 00:08:45,079
The bondage,

123
00:08:45,967 --> 00:08:47,810
the auto asphyxiation...

124
00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:51,217
... introduce a new

125
00:08:51,738 --> 00:08:55,046
element to our understanding
of his sexual behaviour.

126
00:08:56,354 --> 00:08:59,087
Has any information returned to you

127
00:08:59,098 --> 00:09:01,617
over the last 12 hours voluntarily?

128
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,847
I don't think so.

129
00:09:07,234 --> 00:09:08,587
Hold this in your hand.

130
00:09:10,194 --> 00:09:11,523
Keep it safe.

131
00:09:11,914 --> 00:09:14,319
Can you give it back to
me in 15 minutes' time?

132
00:09:14,863 --> 00:09:16,006
Yes.

133
00:09:17,171 --> 00:09:19,152
Who's the British Prime Minister?

134
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:22,359
Tony Blair.

135
00:09:24,757 --> 00:09:26,449
Have you heard of Facebook?

136
00:09:28,164 --> 00:09:29,989
- Yes.
- What is it?

137
00:09:31,394 --> 00:09:32,686
It's...

138
00:09:33,285 --> 00:09:35,377
a social networking site.

139
00:09:36,226 --> 00:09:37,896
And what about Twitter?

140
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,179
I don't know what that is.

141
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:46,114
So you don't know what
a tweet is, or tweeting?

142
00:09:49,514 --> 00:09:51,321
The sound a bird makes.

143
00:09:54,034 --> 00:09:55,583
What's a hashtag?

144
00:09:58,957 --> 00:10:00,128
No idea.

145
00:10:02,108 --> 00:10:03,479
Presumably,

146
00:10:03,673 --> 00:10:05,771
I'm supposed to know
what these things are?

147
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:08,474
Maybe.

148
00:10:11,597 --> 00:10:13,195
The main thing

149
00:10:13,251 --> 00:10:15,731
is that we identify
and find these women.

150
00:10:17,354 --> 00:10:18,972
Use the initials,

151
00:10:19,522 --> 00:10:21,070
look at solved or unsolved

152
00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:23,955
sexually motivated murders,
or attempted murders,

153
00:10:24,138 --> 00:10:27,629
particularly strangulations
occurring in homes and apartments,

154
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,758
check Missing Persons for

155
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:32,878
suspected foul play.

156
00:10:34,954 --> 00:10:37,554
We need to know if these
women are alive or dead.

157
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,635
I think that's all, unless
there's anything else?

158
00:10:43,857 --> 00:10:45,283
We've confirmed the list of

159
00:10:45,294 --> 00:10:47,519
children's homes Spector was in,

160
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,356
following the death of his mother.

161
00:10:49,612 --> 00:10:52,081
We have lists of all his fellow pupils,

162
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:54,023
including those at Gortnacull.

163
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,474
Any news on the Benedetto girl?

164
00:10:56,594 --> 00:10:59,674
Uniforms called at her
house this morning, Ma'am.

165
00:10:59,674 --> 00:11:01,175
She didn't come home last night,

166
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:03,314
her mother has no idea where she is.

167
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:05,742
A warrant's been issued for her arrest.

168
00:11:08,154 --> 00:11:09,504
Thank you all.

169
00:11:11,554 --> 00:11:13,849
What's the last full day you remember?

170
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:19,016
It was with Olivia.

171
00:11:19,904 --> 00:11:20,994
Go on.

172
00:11:23,674 --> 00:11:24,881
Erm...

173
00:11:25,714 --> 00:11:27,145
I took her to a playgroup,

174
00:11:27,716 --> 00:11:29,564
a musical playgroup.

175
00:11:31,063 --> 00:11:32,793
She loves dancing.

176
00:11:34,074 --> 00:11:35,351
And, erm...

177
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:37,311
they all sing songs,

178
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:39,602
The Wheels On The Bus.

179
00:11:41,024 --> 00:11:43,770
She touches all the right places when

180
00:11:43,793 --> 00:11:46,267
she does Head,
Shoulders, Knees And Toes.

181
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,410
Then we went for lunch in the park.

182
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:58,154
She was pedalling on her tricycle.

183
00:12:00,434 --> 00:12:03,920
There's a pair of swans
on the water there,

184
00:12:04,342 --> 00:12:05,954
nine or ten babies.

185
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:07,837
Ugly ducklings.

186
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:11,517
She was talking loads.

187
00:12:12,238 --> 00:12:13,659
She's always getting me to

188
00:12:14,175 --> 00:12:15,867
play make believe with her.

189
00:12:16,634 --> 00:12:19,364
It sounds to me like Olivia
is about two years old.

190
00:12:19,597 --> 00:12:20,879
Yes.

191
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:23,082
But she isn't, is she?

192
00:13:59,415 --> 00:14:02,239
Can you describe what the
memory loss feels like to you?

193
00:14:08,874 --> 00:14:09,954
Well...

194
00:14:12,114 --> 00:14:14,829
it feels like it's night-time and...

195
00:14:16,594 --> 00:14:18,248
there's a thunderstorm and

196
00:14:18,864 --> 00:14:20,812
I'm standing on a hillside...

197
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:23,487
and I've been asked to

198
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:26,605
draw a map of the valley below.

199
00:14:28,874 --> 00:14:30,434
There's lightning flashes.

200
00:14:31,411 --> 00:14:32,950
They light up the land,

201
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,946
but only for a few seconds,

202
00:14:35,194 --> 00:14:37,034
not long enough to draw the map.

203
00:14:46,516 --> 00:14:48,394
Can you recall who you are?

204
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:49,823
In the sense of what

205
00:14:49,835 --> 00:14:51,705
you were like and what you're like now?

206
00:14:52,121 --> 00:14:54,297
Your trait characteristics?

207
00:14:56,554 --> 00:14:58,148
Erm...

208
00:15:00,218 --> 00:15:01,866
I'm told I have a son.

209
00:15:04,914 --> 00:15:06,256
I've no reason to

210
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,642
think that people are
lying to me, but...

211
00:15:09,634 --> 00:15:11,250
... I don't feel it.

212
00:15:13,794 --> 00:15:16,262
I'm told I'm in trouble with the police.

213
00:15:17,794 --> 00:15:19,434
I don't know what I've done.

214
00:15:23,274 --> 00:15:26,118
I think that I might be different

215
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:29,092
but I don't know why.

216
00:15:31,285 --> 00:15:32,517
I feel like

217
00:15:33,144 --> 00:15:34,814
I'm an all-right person?

218
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:03,415
It will all come back to me, won't it?

219
00:16:05,408 --> 00:16:08,094
Your anterograde memory is working well.

220
00:16:10,668 --> 00:16:12,539
Anything else you've forgotten,

221
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:13,987
you can relearn.

222
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:19,281
But the ownership has gone.

223
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:02,626
Gibson?

224
00:17:02,665 --> 00:17:06,298
Patrick Spencer, ICU Consultant,
Belfast General Hospital.

225
00:17:06,874 --> 00:17:08,800
Thank you for calling me back, Doctor.

226
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,276
- I understand he's conscious?
- He is.

227
00:17:11,658 --> 00:17:13,482
His physiology is normalising.

228
00:17:13,878 --> 00:17:16,042
He's cardiovascularly stable...

229
00:17:16,162 --> 00:17:17,693
and has made good progress given the

230
00:17:17,735 --> 00:17:20,773
massive insult and blood
loss from the bullet wounds...

231
00:17:21,258 --> 00:17:22,674
But?

232
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:25,406
But there is an issue.

233
00:17:25,718 --> 00:17:27,383
Although his short-term memory

234
00:17:27,418 --> 00:17:29,610
seems to be functioning adequately...

235
00:17:30,354 --> 00:17:32,308
... it seems Mr Spector has suffered

236
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,874
quite extensive long-term memory loss.

237
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:46,286
OK.

238
00:17:48,395 --> 00:17:50,254
I'm just going to move your legs

239
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:53,458
to the edge of the bed, here. OK...

240
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:55,310
I'm now going to take your arm now.

241
00:17:57,981 --> 00:17:59,514
OK, here we go...

242
00:18:05,645 --> 00:18:06,797
Keep going.

243
00:18:07,282 --> 00:18:09,127
Over here...

244
00:18:10,514 --> 00:18:11,804
Here.

245
00:18:16,646 --> 00:18:19,483
OK, that's good. Well done.

246
00:18:21,307 --> 00:18:23,783
Apparently, he's docile,

247
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:27,256
well oriented in time
and space and has...

248
00:18:27,443 --> 00:18:30,624
established good relations
with his doctors and nurses.

249
00:18:30,624 --> 00:18:32,250
(For pity's sake!)

250
00:18:32,854 --> 00:18:35,531
It seems he can acquire new information

251
00:18:35,545 --> 00:18:38,446
and keep track of his medical
procedures, but that he has

252
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,121
almost no recollection of the events

253
00:18:41,137 --> 00:18:43,807
that have taken place over
the last six years or so.

254
00:18:43,868 --> 00:18:46,000
Are we supposed to be
taking this seriously?

255
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,944
I think we have to.

256
00:18:49,884 --> 00:18:51,504
Are they linking this...

257
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:54,689
... this impairment
directly to the shooting?

258
00:18:55,464 --> 00:18:58,744
The nature of the amnesia
has not been established yet.

259
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:02,729
It... It might be organic, an

260
00:19:02,757 --> 00:19:04,849
injury to the brain
because of blood loss

261
00:19:04,865 --> 00:19:06,985
or a resultant lack of oxygen,

262
00:19:07,384 --> 00:19:09,704
or it could be psychogenic,

263
00:19:10,053 --> 00:19:12,201
a result, perhaps, of trauma.

264
00:19:13,332 --> 00:19:16,462
But until they do an MRI
scan, they can't really say.

265
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,819
So, perform the MRI scan.

266
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:22,777
Spector has retained metal fragments

267
00:19:22,782 --> 00:19:24,314
from the bullet in his body.

268
00:19:25,551 --> 00:19:27,310
If they contain iron,

269
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:28,908
the fragments can be heated up

270
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,325
and the magnet can drag
them through the body and

271
00:19:31,328 --> 00:19:33,320
cause more organ damage.

272
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,761
Are they conducting
psychological tests yet?

273
00:19:35,978 --> 00:19:37,348
Yes, they are.

274
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:39,446
The Consultant Neuropsychologist

275
00:19:39,463 --> 00:19:41,588
- is an Alison Walden.
- But Jim's right.

276
00:19:41,777 --> 00:19:44,850
He must be feigning,
surely? Or at the very least,

277
00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:47,591
- exaggerating his symptoms?
- To what end?

278
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:50,205
The law does not concern itself

279
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,197
with the present state of
mind of the criminal defendant,

280
00:19:52,236 --> 00:19:53,950
only with the state of mind

281
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,682
at the time the crime was committed.

282
00:19:55,715 --> 00:19:58,273
And Spector's was clearly conveyed

283
00:19:58,301 --> 00:20:00,160
in his confession. He clearly understood

284
00:20:00,171 --> 00:20:01,802
the difference between right

285
00:20:02,024 --> 00:20:04,265
and wrong at the time of the crimes,

286
00:20:04,298 --> 00:20:06,435
and, therefore, he will
be held accountable.

287
00:20:07,084 --> 00:20:09,784
But it is founded on
memory-based evidence.

288
00:20:11,024 --> 00:20:13,560
And he's saying that he can't
remember any of the crimes.

289
00:20:13,572 --> 00:20:16,185
It poses all sorts of
problems for the courts.

290
00:20:16,696 --> 00:20:19,664
It's almost like he's
claiming that he's innocent.

291
00:20:20,064 --> 00:20:22,454
It seems there's more
than usual pressure

292
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,784
to build the evidential
case against him.

293
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,202
That's precisely what we're doing, sir.

294
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:34,047
What will happen to him
if the defence does ask

295
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:35,545
for a mental health assessment?

296
00:20:35,595 --> 00:20:39,541
His potential dangerousness
suggests a forensic unit

297
00:20:39,763 --> 00:20:41,683
rather than a hospital ward.

298
00:20:41,744 --> 00:20:43,098
And where would that be?

299
00:20:43,218 --> 00:20:45,556
The Foyle Clinic in East Belfast.

300
00:20:45,676 --> 00:20:47,032
Who will assess him?

301
00:20:47,525 --> 00:20:49,179
August Larson.

302
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:52,220
He's the Consultant
Forensic Psychiatrist.

303
00:20:52,254 --> 00:20:53,785
Very experienced,

304
00:20:53,963 --> 00:20:56,521
very used to giving
expert testimony in court.

305
00:20:58,285 --> 00:21:00,388
The sooner we get him out
of the hands of the medics,

306
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,757
and back into the justice
system, the better.

307
00:21:19,106 --> 00:21:20,443
Thanks, Alison.

308
00:21:34,384 --> 00:21:37,170
Kiera Sheridan. Mr
Spector's dedicated nurse.

309
00:21:37,203 --> 00:21:38,885
She provides him with one-to-one care.

310
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:40,278
She will limit your visit

311
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,653
- if patient status warrants it.
- Thank you.

312
00:21:42,773 --> 00:21:44,068
She'll show you in.

313
00:21:51,784 --> 00:21:53,386
What about the wife?

314
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:56,344
I'm worried about her.

315
00:21:57,436 --> 00:21:58,990
It's obviously been a

316
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,521
devastating blow to her

317
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,799
as it would be to anyone
who seems to have had

318
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:04,739
no real suspicions.

319
00:22:05,255 --> 00:22:07,369
But there's no possibility of her

320
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,234
repeating the offence.

321
00:22:10,043 --> 00:22:11,680
She's admitted her guilt,

322
00:22:11,691 --> 00:22:13,464
she's corrected the facts.

323
00:22:13,584 --> 00:22:14,816
She might even end up being

324
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,342
a witness for the prosecution.

325
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:19,977
I think we should drop the charges.

326
00:22:20,097 --> 00:22:21,386
If she'd told the truth,

327
00:22:21,414 --> 00:22:23,911
in the first place, about
Spector's whereabouts,

328
00:22:24,255 --> 00:22:26,519
then we could have
investigated him more closely

329
00:22:27,035 --> 00:22:29,122
and, perhaps, Rose Stagg
would not have been put

330
00:22:29,122 --> 00:22:30,842
through the ordeal that she has.

331
00:22:33,062 --> 00:22:34,588
I just feel

332
00:22:35,004 --> 00:22:36,996
that pursuing her through the courts

333
00:22:37,013 --> 00:22:38,704
will likely have a very bad effect

334
00:22:38,727 --> 00:22:40,658
on her mental and physical health.

335
00:22:42,312 --> 00:22:43,988
Is prosecution

336
00:22:44,315 --> 00:22:46,446
really in the public interest?

337
00:22:46,646 --> 00:22:48,904
As Director of Public Prosecutions,

338
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:50,625
I have to say, I think it is.

339
00:22:50,908 --> 00:22:53,184
How things will unfold
with Spector is unclear.

340
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:56,041
Prosecuting his wife
sends a clear signal:

341
00:22:56,946 --> 00:22:58,256
we mean business

342
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:00,959
and no-one involved will
be getting off lightly.

343
00:23:04,127 --> 00:23:06,292
Sally Ann Spector miscarried

344
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:07,712
in police custody.

345
00:23:09,482 --> 00:23:12,229
That's a devastating thing
to happen to any woman,

346
00:23:12,978 --> 00:23:14,177
but particularly her.

347
00:23:14,188 --> 00:23:16,368
Her identity is wrapped up

348
00:23:16,385 --> 00:23:18,594
in her children and
those that she cares for.

349
00:23:18,854 --> 00:23:21,351
She's perceived as an angel

350
00:23:21,373 --> 00:23:22,849
by the parents of the babies

351
00:23:22,849 --> 00:23:24,819
she looks after in the NICU.

352
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:26,928
Now, it appears as if

353
00:23:27,111 --> 00:23:29,374
she's lost everything, her marriage, her

354
00:23:30,023 --> 00:23:32,304
work, her unborn child.

355
00:23:34,484 --> 00:23:37,247
She's paid a very high
price for her naivety.

356
00:23:37,303 --> 00:23:39,144
I can't believe that, of all people,

357
00:23:39,162 --> 00:23:42,758
you are suggesting that we treat
Sally Ann paternalistically.

358
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,815
I say we move ahead with the charges

359
00:23:47,115 --> 00:23:49,618
and we can use them as
leverage against Spector.

360
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,516
I do think we need to bear in mind

361
00:23:51,521 --> 00:23:53,907
the seriousness of the offence.

362
00:23:57,537 --> 00:23:59,296
We accepted instructions

363
00:23:59,346 --> 00:24:00,782
on your behalf from your wife

364
00:24:00,784 --> 00:24:02,231
when you were unconscious.

365
00:24:02,297 --> 00:24:05,449
Today is an opportunity
for you to say if you are

366
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,721
happy for us to be representing you.

367
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,512
I believe that the nature

368
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:12,881
of your injuries has
been explained to you?

369
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,852
Yes.

370
00:24:15,384 --> 00:24:17,532
And you understand that
you were in police custody

371
00:24:17,538 --> 00:24:18,770
when you were shot?

372
00:24:19,352 --> 00:24:21,624
Yes, but I still don't know why.

373
00:24:21,644 --> 00:24:23,144
No-one will tell me.

374
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,332
An individual called James Tyler

375
00:24:27,338 --> 00:24:28,564
was responsible.

376
00:24:36,294 --> 00:24:37,720
I don't know who that is.

377
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,417
Why did he shoot me?

378
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,476
I need to get more
information from the police

379
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,880
before I can explain that.

380
00:24:44,785 --> 00:24:47,104
The more pressing issue, Mr Spector,

381
00:24:47,909 --> 00:24:49,557
is that the police have charged you

382
00:24:49,568 --> 00:24:51,965
with a number of very
serious crimes. I mean,

383
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,944
the most serious crimes
on the Statute Book.

384
00:24:56,299 --> 00:24:57,592
What crimes?

385
00:24:57,712 --> 00:24:59,024
A series of murders.

386
00:25:04,978 --> 00:25:06,426
What sort of murders?

387
00:25:07,237 --> 00:25:08,846
With your permission,

388
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:11,260
let me take you through
the police charge sheet.

389
00:25:13,391 --> 00:25:15,767
All the, er... alleged crimes

390
00:25:15,822 --> 00:25:17,354
took place in Belfast.

391
00:25:19,135 --> 00:25:22,631
The police claim that on the
10th day of December, 2011,

392
00:25:22,664 --> 00:25:25,144
you murdered University
lecturer Fiona Gallagher

393
00:25:25,172 --> 00:25:27,697
in her home before fleeing the scene.

394
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,188
Death by strangulation.

395
00:25:31,548 --> 00:25:35,854
That on the 15th of March, 2012,

396
00:25:36,381 --> 00:25:39,833
you murdered architect
Alice Monroe in her home,

397
00:25:40,024 --> 00:25:41,665
strangling her with a ligature.

398
00:25:43,058 --> 00:25:46,127
They allege that you then
washed and dried her body,

399
00:25:46,471 --> 00:25:48,346
before putting her back to bed

400
00:25:48,568 --> 00:25:50,144
and posing her body.

401
00:25:50,704 --> 00:25:54,616
That on the 16th of April, 2012,

402
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:58,096
you murdered solicitor
Sarah Kay in her home,

403
00:25:58,135 --> 00:25:59,904
strangling her with a ligature.

404
00:26:01,675 --> 00:26:04,622
They allege that you washed

405
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,744
and dried Sarah's body,

406
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,138
washed and dried her bedclothes...

407
00:26:10,264 --> 00:26:12,966
... painted her finger nails red,

408
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:15,102
before posing her in her bed

409
00:26:15,222 --> 00:26:16,723
and taking photographs.

410
00:26:17,904 --> 00:26:20,879
Sarah Kay was pregnant
at the time of her death.

411
00:26:23,904 --> 00:26:25,530
That four days later,

412
00:26:25,596 --> 00:26:28,210
on the 20th of April, 2012...

413
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,122
... you attacked and strangled

414
00:26:32,194 --> 00:26:35,024
accountant Annie Brawley in her home.

415
00:26:37,664 --> 00:26:39,864
They claim that you...

416
00:26:39,984 --> 00:26:42,659
also murdered her brother Joseph Brawley

417
00:26:42,984 --> 00:26:44,862
when he tried to defend his sister,

418
00:26:45,144 --> 00:26:46,765
stabbing him three times

419
00:26:46,792 --> 00:26:49,217
with some decorating shears.

420
00:26:49,478 --> 00:26:51,187
You, then, fled the scene.

421
00:26:51,725 --> 00:26:54,272
Annie Brawley survived the attack.

422
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,881
I don't recognise any of these people.

423
00:27:01,514 --> 00:27:03,501
I've never seen these people before.

424
00:27:04,334 --> 00:27:05,784
There's more.

425
00:27:07,507 --> 00:27:10,144
They allege that on May the 3rd,

426
00:27:10,449 --> 00:27:13,601
you abducted Rose Stagg from her home,

427
00:27:14,694 --> 00:27:16,852
imprisoned her unlawfully

428
00:27:16,972 --> 00:27:19,033
and detained her against her will.

429
00:27:25,475 --> 00:27:26,744
I know her.

430
00:27:29,504 --> 00:27:32,619
- Rose what, who did you say?
- Stagg.

431
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:36,398
Perhaps you know Mrs Stagg
better as Rose McGill?

432
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:40,543
Yes.

433
00:27:42,984 --> 00:27:44,915
But I haven't seen her

434
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:46,980
in the last four years or so.

435
00:27:48,051 --> 00:27:50,232
When did you last see her, do you think?

436
00:27:52,989 --> 00:27:54,499
Early summer.

437
00:27:55,237 --> 00:27:56,624
2002.

438
00:27:58,206 --> 00:28:00,984
2002 is ten years ago, not four.

439
00:28:01,452 --> 00:28:04,116
Have you been listening
to the charges, Mr Spector?

440
00:28:04,464 --> 00:28:05,904
It's May 2012.

441
00:28:09,904 --> 00:28:10,904
I'm sorry.

442
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:13,427
I'm sorry.

443
00:28:17,206 --> 00:28:18,744
What happened to Rose?

444
00:28:20,104 --> 00:28:21,344
She's alive.

445
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:25,070
The police say you led them to her.

446
00:28:25,902 --> 00:28:27,933
She was found in the
boot of her own car.

447
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,813
The police suggest you left her trapped.

448
00:28:31,146 --> 00:28:32,683
Left her to die.

449
00:28:38,344 --> 00:28:40,104
Why would I do that to Rose?

450
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:07,294
The police say they have a confession.

451
00:29:07,824 --> 00:29:09,924
That you made a number of admissions.

452
00:29:12,072 --> 00:29:13,384
I've, um...

453
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:14,818
no memory of that.

454
00:29:15,264 --> 00:29:17,515
We think it makes sense for
your first appearance in court

455
00:29:17,531 --> 00:29:18,586
to be as soon as possible

456
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:21,438
because it will initiate the
evidential disclosure process.

457
00:29:21,744 --> 00:29:23,285
Will you be strong enough?

458
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,881
Once we are in receipt
of those documents,

459
00:29:26,892 --> 00:29:28,824
we will look at the
detail of that confession

460
00:29:28,944 --> 00:29:31,569
and take you through every
bit of evidence against you,

461
00:29:31,689 --> 00:29:32,912
every witness statement,

462
00:29:32,934 --> 00:29:34,904
page by page, line by line.

463
00:29:36,158 --> 00:29:37,418
Is that all clear?

464
00:29:40,664 --> 00:29:41,940
Yes.

465
00:29:42,667 --> 00:29:43,904
Any questions?

466
00:29:50,281 --> 00:29:52,504
I just need some time
for it all to sink in.

467
00:29:52,861 --> 00:29:54,065
Of course.

468
00:29:57,104 --> 00:29:58,904
Do you know who that is?

469
00:30:04,014 --> 00:30:05,104
No.

470
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:07,538
Should I?

471
00:30:07,777 --> 00:30:10,612
If any memories relevant
to the case return to you,

472
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,715
please contact Louise here.

473
00:30:14,985 --> 00:30:17,083
We're here to help you, Mr Spector.

474
00:30:18,509 --> 00:30:20,490
We will guide you through this.

475
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,438
Thank you.

476
00:31:12,584 --> 00:31:15,055
Sorry, ma'am. Rose
Stagg is here to see you.

477
00:31:17,702 --> 00:31:19,561
Set up an interview room, Dani.

478
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:21,481
I'd like you to sit in.

479
00:31:22,258 --> 00:31:23,544
Of course.

480
00:31:29,904 --> 00:31:32,214
I woke to find him in bed with me.

481
00:31:37,264 --> 00:31:38,911
He took me downstairs,

482
00:31:39,216 --> 00:31:40,920
his hand over my mouth,

483
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,101
took me into the kitchen.

484
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:47,102
Go on.

485
00:31:48,917 --> 00:31:50,809
He used my name.

486
00:31:51,903 --> 00:31:53,504
He called me Rose.

487
00:31:59,464 --> 00:32:02,041
I thought, perhaps, I
recognised the voice.

488
00:32:05,476 --> 00:32:08,664
He said he didn't want to
hurt me or my lovely family...

489
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:11,992
... but that he would if I cried out.

490
00:32:15,749 --> 00:32:17,530
And then he released me.

491
00:32:21,043 --> 00:32:23,984
And when I turned
round, I recognised him.

492
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:29,824
What did you think in that moment?

493
00:32:35,405 --> 00:32:36,824
Just for a moment...

494
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,511
... I thought that maybe
it would be all right.

495
00:32:41,754 --> 00:32:43,713
That maybe it was a joke,

496
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,788
a game.

497
00:33:00,089 --> 00:33:01,498
What did you say?

498
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,393
I just said, "Peter?"

499
00:33:14,023 --> 00:33:15,189
He...

500
00:33:15,384 --> 00:33:17,020
made me dress from clothes

501
00:33:17,026 --> 00:33:18,940
that were hanging in the utility room.

502
00:33:20,824 --> 00:33:22,303
He made me write a note.

503
00:33:22,364 --> 00:33:24,079
He told me what to put.

504
00:33:27,087 --> 00:33:29,144
The house seemed so silent.

505
00:33:31,544 --> 00:33:33,918
The sound of the pen on the paper

506
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,143
seemed really loud in my head.

507
00:33:37,164 --> 00:33:38,624
Like a whooshing.

508
00:33:41,242 --> 00:33:44,078
All I could think about was
getting him out of there,

509
00:33:44,198 --> 00:33:45,944
away from Nancy.

510
00:33:48,105 --> 00:33:49,744
Did you resist him at all?

511
00:33:52,744 --> 00:33:54,584
Er... I was numb.

512
00:33:57,213 --> 00:33:58,944
I didn't really struggle

513
00:33:58,983 --> 00:34:02,024
until he was walking me
towards that awful building.

514
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,305
I thought, "If he takes me in there...

515
00:34:10,203 --> 00:34:12,045
... I'm gonna die.

516
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:16,944
I'm going to be the next victim."

517
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:21,324
That's when I tried to run.

518
00:34:24,464 --> 00:34:26,196
But he was too strong.

519
00:34:34,793 --> 00:34:36,474
He made tapes of you.

520
00:34:38,178 --> 00:34:41,296
We found edited versions
of those tapes on his phone.

521
00:34:44,038 --> 00:34:45,725
You've seen them?

522
00:34:53,242 --> 00:34:55,511
He tied me to a chair.

523
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:58,224
It was fixed to the ground.

524
00:35:00,095 --> 00:35:01,599
And he sat behind the camera,

525
00:35:01,605 --> 00:35:03,192
so that when I looked at him,

526
00:35:03,663 --> 00:35:06,064
I was looking directly into the lens.

527
00:35:08,504 --> 00:35:10,361
He hardly spoke, he...

528
00:35:11,824 --> 00:35:13,374
He just stared at me.

529
00:35:19,295 --> 00:35:22,264
I tried everything I could
to get through to him.

530
00:35:23,513 --> 00:35:26,703
I begged him, I flattered him,

531
00:35:26,823 --> 00:35:29,594
I insulted him. I tried
to provoke him, even.

532
00:35:32,069 --> 00:35:33,904
He didn't respond.

533
00:35:35,948 --> 00:35:37,158
His eyes were open,

534
00:35:37,164 --> 00:35:39,100
but it was like he was in a trance.

535
00:35:40,815 --> 00:35:42,740
Did he sexually assault you?

536
00:35:45,304 --> 00:35:46,304
No.

537
00:35:47,285 --> 00:35:48,684
I don't think so.

538
00:35:51,014 --> 00:35:53,389
Did he perform sex acts on himself?

539
00:35:54,011 --> 00:35:55,664
Did he masturbate in front of you?

540
00:35:56,542 --> 00:35:58,523
No. Just the filming.

541
00:36:04,889 --> 00:36:06,582
Are those healing all right?

542
00:36:09,957 --> 00:36:11,864
I'm told I did it to myself.

543
00:36:14,224 --> 00:36:16,043
I have no memory of that.

544
00:36:16,864 --> 00:36:20,155
We found the broken lens
from a pair of sunglasses

545
00:36:20,184 --> 00:36:21,775
in the boot of your car.

546
00:36:22,114 --> 00:36:23,446
Your blood was on them.

547
00:36:23,468 --> 00:36:24,967
There were no other fingerprints.

548
00:36:29,584 --> 00:36:32,104
I can't work out if it's just marks...

549
00:36:33,857 --> 00:36:35,566
... or if it's a message.

550
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:39,304
When I first saw it...

551
00:36:40,477 --> 00:36:42,575
... it looked like an attempt to write

552
00:36:43,308 --> 00:36:44,567
"I love you".

553
00:36:54,789 --> 00:36:56,224
Breathe.

554
00:37:06,584 --> 00:37:09,069
I always thought that I wanted...

555
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:12,736
... love and security.

556
00:37:14,544 --> 00:37:16,172
Now I just

557
00:37:16,805 --> 00:37:19,064
feel like I'm floating free...

558
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,464
... in a void.

559
00:37:26,859 --> 00:37:28,491
Oh...

560
00:37:31,948 --> 00:37:34,789
You have such a strong sense of purpose.

561
00:37:36,824 --> 00:37:38,180
I feel like...

562
00:37:38,744 --> 00:37:41,624
there's nothing beneath
my feet right now, like...

563
00:37:43,134 --> 00:37:45,104
... nothing to steady them.

564
00:37:49,655 --> 00:37:52,168
It's as if I'm slightly drunk... !

565
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,292
Rose. Rose...

566
00:37:57,833 --> 00:37:59,148
Remember...

567
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:01,704
... you survived.

568
00:38:05,544 --> 00:38:07,144
You got through it.

569
00:38:09,824 --> 00:38:11,384
It's in the past.

570
00:38:27,407 --> 00:38:30,736
Paul Spector, a 32-year-old
bereavement counsellor

571
00:38:30,759 --> 00:38:34,184
from South Belfast charged
with four counts of murder

572
00:38:34,216 --> 00:38:37,301
is due to make his first
appearance in court today.

573
00:38:37,504 --> 00:38:38,971
The four female victims,

574
00:38:38,993 --> 00:38:41,463
all young professional
women in their 30s,

575
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:43,899
were attacked in their homes at night.

576
00:38:44,019 --> 00:38:48,016
Three of those women died of
manual or ligature strangulation.

577
00:38:48,815 --> 00:38:51,344
Spector, a married man
and a father of two,

578
00:38:51,356 --> 00:38:55,384
is also charged with the attempted
murder of accountant Annie Brawley

579
00:38:55,504 --> 00:38:57,954
and the abduction and
unlawful imprisonment

580
00:38:58,074 --> 00:39:00,704
of Belfast radiologist Rose Stagg...

581
00:39:31,658 --> 00:39:33,944
I worry this is all too soon for you.

582
00:39:35,515 --> 00:39:36,881
I'll be fine.

583
00:39:59,702 --> 00:40:01,069
Are you getting this?

584
00:40:01,702 --> 00:40:03,067
The victims' families...

585
00:40:03,104 --> 00:40:04,664
Detective Superintendent Gibson!

586
00:40:04,664 --> 00:40:06,119
The man you have in custody,

587
00:40:06,163 --> 00:40:07,773
- will he be appearing in court today?
- Will you be making a statement

588
00:40:07,784 --> 00:40:08,950
any time soon?

589
00:40:09,527 --> 00:40:12,651
Chief Superintendent, is Spector
appearing in person today?

590
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:14,172
Give us an update on the condition

591
00:40:14,177 --> 00:40:15,598
of Rose Stagg...

592
00:40:36,748 --> 00:40:38,224
Are you ready for this?

593
00:40:38,224 --> 00:40:39,824
I'm a bit nervous, but, yeah.

594
00:40:40,449 --> 00:40:42,264
Yeah, shall we head up, then?

595
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,977
- How are you?
- Not too bad...

596
00:41:20,005 --> 00:41:21,226
Stand there.

597
00:41:31,858 --> 00:41:33,567
Look straight into that camera.

598
00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:36,696
You will be able to see the
judge and the legal teams.

599
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:38,417
Answer any questions clearly.

600
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,637
The prosecution has suggested

601
00:41:59,643 --> 00:42:01,446
we read the shortened
version of the charge.

602
00:42:01,468 --> 00:42:03,710
- Are you happy enough with that?
- Yeah, that's fine.

603
00:42:08,944 --> 00:42:10,384
All rise.

604
00:42:16,824 --> 00:42:18,804
Thank you. Please sit.

605
00:42:24,082 --> 00:42:25,824
Are you ready to proceed, ma'am?

606
00:42:27,784 --> 00:42:29,015
I am.

607
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:36,274
Mr Spector, can you see
and hear the proceedings?

608
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,894
Yes.

609
00:42:38,488 --> 00:42:40,397
The charges against the accused

610
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:42,544
are stated as four counts of murder,

611
00:42:42,966 --> 00:42:44,708
one of attempted murder

612
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:48,204
and one of abduction and
unlawful imprisonment.

613
00:42:48,637 --> 00:42:49,952
Can you confirm for the court

614
00:42:49,952 --> 00:42:51,716
that you are Peter Paul Spector?

615
00:42:52,676 --> 00:42:53,940
Yes.

616
00:42:53,968 --> 00:42:57,624
That your date of birth
is the 25th May, 1979.

617
00:42:57,744 --> 00:42:59,144
That's correct.

618
00:42:59,522 --> 00:43:03,146
And that you live at 64,
Tiberias Drive, Belfast,

619
00:43:03,168 --> 00:43:05,624
BT6 7KM?

620
00:43:06,437 --> 00:43:07,784
So I've been told.

621
00:43:12,275 --> 00:43:14,264
Why is he answering in that manner?

622
00:43:14,578 --> 00:43:16,403
Ma'am, if I may.

623
00:43:17,075 --> 00:43:19,428
My client has to answer in that manner

624
00:43:19,445 --> 00:43:21,784
because he has suffered
significant memory loss.

625
00:43:22,042 --> 00:43:23,357
As you no doubt know,

626
00:43:23,385 --> 00:43:26,509
Mr Spector was shot
while in police custody.

627
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,638
He lost his spleen as a result
and was in a coma for some time.

628
00:43:30,758 --> 00:43:32,908
The reason he is appearing from hospital

629
00:43:32,941 --> 00:43:35,610
is that he is still being
held there in intensive care.

630
00:43:36,024 --> 00:43:37,503
I have written reports

631
00:43:37,509 --> 00:43:40,094
from the ICU Consultant, Dr Spencer,

632
00:43:40,104 --> 00:43:44,157
and from the Consultant
Neuropsychologist Dr Alison Walden,

633
00:43:44,277 --> 00:43:46,232
that explain the nature and degree

634
00:43:46,237 --> 00:43:48,685
of my client's disability.

635
00:43:49,224 --> 00:43:51,648
Dr Walden is approved under Part

636
00:43:51,654 --> 00:43:54,264
of the Mental Health Order 1986.

637
00:43:54,384 --> 00:43:55,822
There's information there about

638
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,080
the treatment Mr Spector has undergone

639
00:43:58,091 --> 00:44:01,424
and an account of his
behaviour in hospital.

640
00:44:01,471 --> 00:44:03,064
The memory loss, you will see,

641
00:44:03,064 --> 00:44:05,239
covers a period of
approximately six years

642
00:44:05,272 --> 00:44:06,637
up to and including

643
00:44:06,757 --> 00:44:08,719
the recent shooting.

644
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:12,692
One of the primary
foundations of criminal law

645
00:44:12,725 --> 00:44:14,567
is that all defendants

646
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:18,390
are capable of actively
participating in their defence.

647
00:44:18,818 --> 00:44:22,569
Mr Spector's amnesia
prevents him from so doing.

648
00:44:23,529 --> 00:44:26,514
Whilst Mr Spector understands
that he is in court

649
00:44:26,544 --> 00:44:28,994
and charged with a number
of criminal offences

650
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:31,147
and understands the nature and object

651
00:44:31,267 --> 00:44:33,345
and the possible consequences
of the proceedings,

652
00:44:33,664 --> 00:44:35,224
he cannot enter a plea,

653
00:44:35,436 --> 00:44:38,045
he cannot consult with
or assist his lawyer,

654
00:44:38,244 --> 00:44:40,584
he cannot give evidence
in his own defence.

655
00:44:40,584 --> 00:44:43,894
On that basis, I feel I need
to raise the issue of competence

656
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:47,239
as to whether Mr Spector
is fit to stand trial.

657
00:44:47,256 --> 00:44:49,131
Mr Healy, let me stop you there.

658
00:44:49,176 --> 00:44:52,028
The concerns you have raised are noted,

659
00:44:52,327 --> 00:44:53,787
but you know as well as I do

660
00:44:53,797 --> 00:44:56,527
that it's not a matter on
which this court can adjudicate.

661
00:45:00,824 --> 00:45:02,056
Mr Spector,

662
00:45:02,328 --> 00:45:04,669
do you understand that your case

663
00:45:04,686 --> 00:45:06,734
must be sent to Crown Court?

664
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,715
Yes.

665
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,383
Then you will be held
on remand in hospital

666
00:45:12,444 --> 00:45:14,197
until arrangements can be made

667
00:45:14,214 --> 00:45:17,704
to transfer you to a
secure psychiatric clinic

668
00:45:17,948 --> 00:45:20,184
where more tests can be done

669
00:45:20,212 --> 00:45:23,520
to determine the nature
of your mental disability.

670
00:45:43,275 --> 00:45:45,156
That's the guy who's
defending the murderer!

671
00:45:45,173 --> 00:45:47,992
Mr Healy, how does it feel to be
defending the Belfast Strangler?

672
00:45:48,003 --> 00:45:50,734
The ALLEGED Belfast Strangler.

673
00:45:55,226 --> 00:45:58,024
Dressed in a blue sweatshirt
and tracksuit bottoms,

674
00:45:58,024 --> 00:46:00,012
Mr Spector spoke only
to confirm his name

675
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:02,259
and date of birth during
the ten-minute hearing,

676
00:46:02,379 --> 00:46:04,664
at that point proceedings
took a bizarre twist

677
00:46:04,664 --> 00:46:07,182
as it became apparent that
the alleged serial killer

678
00:46:07,226 --> 00:46:09,657
is suffering from
significant memory loss.

679
00:46:10,046 --> 00:46:13,009
Mr Spector was remanded in
custody to undergo further medical

680
00:46:13,053 --> 00:46:14,624
and psychiatric assessment.

681
00:46:14,624 --> 00:46:17,448
Following the hearing, the
public prosecution service

682
00:46:17,448 --> 00:46:19,384
confirmed that Sally Ann Spector

683
00:46:19,384 --> 00:46:22,636
will appear in the Crown
Court on Monday 2nd July

684
00:46:22,756 --> 00:46:25,089
to face charges of perverting
the course of justice.

685
00:46:25,139 --> 00:46:27,637
The prosecution claims
that Mr Spector's wife,

686
00:46:27,681 --> 00:46:30,184
provided her husband with false alibis.

687
00:46:50,264 --> 00:46:51,455
Gibson?

688
00:46:51,766 --> 00:46:53,725
Superintendent Gibson?

689
00:46:54,504 --> 00:46:55,792
Yes.

690
00:46:55,997 --> 00:46:57,901
I'm August Larson.

691
00:46:58,755 --> 00:47:00,587
I'm the consultant psychiatrist

692
00:47:00,603 --> 00:47:02,944
who has been asked to
assess Paul Spector.

693
00:47:05,658 --> 00:47:08,133
It's an odd time to be calling, Doctor.

694
00:47:10,503 --> 00:47:12,184
Are you still working?

695
00:47:12,956 --> 00:47:14,255
Yes.

696
00:47:14,438 --> 00:47:15,944
Well, there you are.

697
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,310
Before he's moved here,

698
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,819
I need to determine the risk of violence

699
00:47:21,825 --> 00:47:23,722
towards himself and others

700
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,742
and plan his management.

701
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:30,110
Have you seen the list of
crimes he's been charged with?

702
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:34,399
I received that information
from the court, yes.

703
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:39,361
In my experience,

704
00:47:39,433 --> 00:47:42,907
a history of previous violence
is the best predictor for

705
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:45,354
future violence for
someone whether they are

706
00:47:45,409 --> 00:47:47,546
mentally disordered or not.

707
00:47:48,372 --> 00:47:50,038
And Paul Spector

708
00:47:50,426 --> 00:47:53,067
is a violent sexual sadist.

709
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:02,104
Why are you so kind to me?

710
00:48:05,984 --> 00:48:07,739
If I've done the things that the...

711
00:48:08,555 --> 00:48:11,119
police say I've done,
then I'm a monster.

712
00:48:13,033 --> 00:48:14,504
It's my job.

713
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:21,784
What?

714
00:48:25,041 --> 00:48:26,884
It says in your notes
that there were tears

715
00:48:26,917 --> 00:48:28,784
in your eyes during your surgery.

716
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:31,201
That you were crying.

717
00:48:35,504 --> 00:48:36,904
Was I?

718
00:48:39,692 --> 00:48:41,617
Does that mean anything to you?

719
00:48:46,357 --> 00:48:47,504
Perhaps...

720
00:48:49,624 --> 00:48:50,864
I just...

721
00:48:51,746 --> 00:48:54,587
- ... can't believe the memory loss is real.
- _

722
00:48:56,202 --> 00:48:58,505
He's just the sort of
person who would feign

723
00:48:59,035 --> 00:49:01,934
amnesia if he felt that there was
something to be gained from it.

724
00:49:02,255 --> 00:49:05,081
Even just for the sheer
delight of duping people,

725
00:49:05,602 --> 00:49:08,071
particularly experts.

726
00:49:08,798 --> 00:49:11,062
Someone like me, for example?

727
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:13,293
I'm just saying that,

728
00:49:13,327 --> 00:49:14,842
from my conversations with him,

729
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:17,582
it seems to me that he
exhibits, if anything, a

730
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:20,645
superior memory for his violence.

731
00:49:21,261 --> 00:49:23,043
It's clear to me

732
00:49:23,277 --> 00:49:26,989
that he rehearsed the crimes
in his mind over and over.

733
00:49:27,754 --> 00:49:29,980
They were heavily scripted.

734
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:33,642
And so, the crimes
themselves were memorable

735
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:36,384
both in the way that
they match the script

736
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:38,384
and in the way that they differ.

737
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:41,904
So, in my view, it's...

738
00:49:42,843 --> 00:49:45,504
... extremely unlikely that he has...

739
00:49:45,728 --> 00:49:47,404
forgotten anything.

740
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:49,302
Faced with memory loss,

741
00:49:49,346 --> 00:49:52,304
there is only one way a clinician can go

742
00:49:52,543 --> 00:49:54,424
and that is to investigate.

743
00:49:56,167 --> 00:49:57,984
If we take him here,

744
00:49:57,984 --> 00:50:00,435
then that is what I intend to do.

745
00:50:01,111 --> 00:50:02,249
If you have the time,

746
00:50:02,264 --> 00:50:05,101
I'd really appreciate
getting a premorbid appraisal

747
00:50:05,144 --> 00:50:06,666
of Mr Spector from you.

748
00:50:06,705 --> 00:50:10,373
As someone who has had
extensive dealings with him.

749
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:13,386
Anything at all you
can tell me about him

750
00:50:13,391 --> 00:50:15,533
would be extremely useful.

751
00:50:18,521 --> 00:50:20,344
I'll help in any way I can.

752
00:50:21,711 --> 00:50:23,087
Thank you.

753
00:50:23,875 --> 00:50:25,390
Good night.

754
00:50:27,071 --> 00:50:28,459
Good night.

755
00:50:41,467 --> 00:50:43,215
Everything went dark.

756
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:47,038
And did time seem to
speed up or slow down?

757
00:50:49,196 --> 00:50:50,511
It sped up.

758
00:50:52,384 --> 00:50:54,823
I was rushing through a tunnel.

759
00:50:56,555 --> 00:51:00,306
And did you see or feel
surrounded by a brilliant light?

760
00:51:01,443 --> 00:51:02,658
There was a light.

761
00:51:02,686 --> 00:51:04,018
Can you describe it?

762
00:51:06,848 --> 00:51:08,374
Incredibly bright.

763
00:51:08,763 --> 00:51:10,499
- Blinding.
- And hot?

764
00:51:11,442 --> 00:51:13,144
No, not hot.

765
00:51:15,144 --> 00:51:16,785
Did you come to a border or a

766
00:51:16,791 --> 00:51:18,333
point of no return?

767
00:51:22,344 --> 00:51:23,937
There was a point. Um...

768
00:51:24,292 --> 00:51:26,024
I felt I could have gone on.

769
00:51:27,177 --> 00:51:30,079
But there were voices calling me back.

770
00:51:30,501 --> 00:51:31,864
What voices?

771
00:51:32,984 --> 00:51:34,241
My daughter.

772
00:51:34,774 --> 00:51:36,033
Olivia.

773
00:52:03,767 --> 00:52:06,430
And was there anyone
else there known to you,

774
00:52:06,935 --> 00:52:08,224
living or dead?

775
00:52:10,064 --> 00:52:11,264
Yes.

776
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,051
Who?

777
00:52:18,064 --> 00:52:19,464
I think my mother.

778
00:52:21,314 --> 00:52:22,704
And what happened?

779
00:52:24,993 --> 00:52:27,285
How did you feel in her presence?

780
00:52:35,531 --> 00:52:36,864
Afraid.

781
00:52:38,301 --> 00:52:39,888
Did she speak to you?

782
00:52:43,517 --> 00:52:44,921
She was calling me.

783
00:52:45,631 --> 00:52:47,035
I think she wanted me to

784
00:52:47,551 --> 00:52:48,966
come to her.

785
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:50,986
Towards the light.

786
00:52:52,468 --> 00:52:54,283
But there was other voices.

787
00:52:55,064 --> 00:52:56,984
My daughter calling me back.

788
00:53:00,593 --> 00:53:02,185
And did you want to come back

789
00:53:02,202 --> 00:53:03,379
to your body?

790
00:53:03,664 --> 00:53:05,260
Come back to life?

791
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:11,304
No.

792
00:53:13,884 --> 00:53:16,059
But I couldn't just abandon her.

793
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:19,624
Is that when you cried?

794
00:53:25,024 --> 00:53:26,304
Hey.

795
00:53:35,816 --> 00:53:37,169
Drink it all up.

796
00:53:42,464 --> 00:53:43,718
Good girl.

797
00:54:20,489 --> 00:54:22,424
You came close with dying.

798
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:27,752
What do you now understand death to be?

799
00:54:27,941 --> 00:54:29,989
What does death mean to you now?

800
00:54:33,719 --> 00:54:35,273
I know that life

801
00:54:35,611 --> 00:54:37,548
is our only true possession.

802
00:54:39,824 --> 00:54:41,064
And death?

803
00:54:50,269 --> 00:54:52,383
I've found a murder
that looks promising.

804
00:54:52,588 --> 00:54:54,753
Really? The right initials?

805
00:54:54,764 --> 00:54:56,423
That's not the connection.

806
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:59,087
A law student. Susan Harper.

807
00:54:59,537 --> 00:55:01,362
Do you think she looks right?

808
00:55:02,284 --> 00:55:03,798
Yes, absolutely.

809
00:55:03,854 --> 00:55:05,785
- Just a bit younger.
- 21.

810
00:55:05,905 --> 00:55:08,827
The only problem is there
is someone doing time for it.

811
00:55:09,248 --> 00:55:11,606
It's an individual called David Alvarez.

812
00:55:11,634 --> 00:55:14,369
I remembered I saw his name yesterday

813
00:55:14,386 --> 00:55:16,332
on the list of children
who were in Gortnacull

814
00:55:16,334 --> 00:55:17,799
at the same time as Spector.

815
00:55:17,919 --> 00:55:19,384
So, I've done some digging.

816
00:55:19,613 --> 00:55:21,178
And they are one and the same.

817
00:55:22,104 --> 00:55:24,547
The David Alvarez who's
doing time for the murder

818
00:55:24,591 --> 00:55:25,922
is the same David Alvarez

819
00:55:25,945 --> 00:55:27,942
who was a fellow pupil
of Spector's at the home.

820
00:55:28,786 --> 00:55:30,544
Why was Alvarez convicted?

821
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:33,344
His DNA on her body.

822
00:55:33,708 --> 00:55:35,572
A subsequent confession.

823
00:55:35,866 --> 00:55:37,584
That's pretty conclusive.

824
00:55:38,984 --> 00:55:40,384
What year is this?

825
00:55:40,856 --> 00:55:43,231
August 2002.

826
00:55:44,724 --> 00:55:46,024
In London.

827
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:50,189
Now, there's a gap in
Spector's time-line.

828
00:55:51,394 --> 00:55:53,158
We don't know where he was

829
00:55:53,435 --> 00:55:55,033
or what he was doing.

830
00:55:56,432 --> 00:55:58,502
No, we don't.

831
00:57:25,274 --> 00:57:26,866
I'll see you in the morning.

832
00:57:27,498 --> 00:57:28,904

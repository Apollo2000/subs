1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,420
You went to the police, Rose.

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:03,110
Made my life very difficult.

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,420
Peter?

4
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:06,630
No!

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,760
First appointment at work
was at eight this morning.

6
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,650
She didn't turn up.
No word from her either.

7
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,160
This has never happened before.

8
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,200
- Can I help you?
- I'm here to see a patient.

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,250
Annie, I'm Paul Spector.

10
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,600
Where's the peck of pickled
peppers Peter Piper picked?

11
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,310
- Did you learn that at school?
- No. From Peter Piper,

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,920
Mummy's friend.

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,150
I warned you once before,
this is your last warning.

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,460
Good.

15
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,690
<i>They've managed to lift a partial
print from the scissors.</i>

16
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,790
<i>We've run it through the system
and found a match.</i>

17
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,230
Paul Spector.

18
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,040
<i>What have you done
with Rose Stagg?</i>

19
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,110
Stella, I don't know what's going
to happen to me, to you,

20
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,570
to anyone else in this world.

21
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,880
<i>All of I know is,</i>

22
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,890
<i>All I know is no-one
can outwit death.</i>

27
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,780
Hey, cutie.

28
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,770
Hey, cutie.

29
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,710
Hello.

30
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,550
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

31
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,960
Did you get any sleep?

32
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,800
A little.

33
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,250
What's he doing here?

34
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,259
- Eastwood's your new deputy SIO.
- Excuse me?

35
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,629
Garrett Brink is tied up
with a court case,

36
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,029
McIlroy has further
blood tests to undergo

37
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,350
and you need someone urgently.

38
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,950
So is he keeping an eye on me
or am I keeping an eye on him?

39
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,090
Make it work.

40
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,980
Don't worry,
we'll beautify it for you.

41
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,580
Good to have you on board.

42
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,440
Likewise.

43
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,100
- Good morning, everybody.
- Morning, ma'am.

44
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,239
I am pleased to say

45
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,309
we are about to take
a very significant step

46
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,049
in our investigation.

47
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,519
This is a formal declaration

48
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,179
that from now on the enquiry

49
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,480
will be focusing on a particular
individual.

50
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,400
Our prime suspect,
Paul Spector.

51
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,899
<i>Paul Spector was caught
on CCTV at the botanic gardens</i>

52
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,250
<i>on Saturday 14th April,</i>

53
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:01,050
<i>the day that Sarah Kay
was there with her sister.</i>

54
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,059
<i>He came in to the police station</i>
on Saturday 21st

55
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,379
and was interviewed by DCI Brink.

56
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,909
He gave his DNA
and his fingerprints

57
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,980
and was, at that point, eliminated.

58
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,729
We now have tangible evidence

59
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:22,550
to link Paul Spector
to the murder of Joe Brawley.

60
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,959
Namely his fingerprints
on a pair of decorating shears,

61
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,130
identical to a pair purchased
by Annie Brawley.

62
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,819
<i>Do we need to put an arrest
strategy in place?</i>

63
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,329
<i>Not yet.</i>

64
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,539
<i>There's very good reason
for believing that</i>

65
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,969
<i>Paul Spector is also responsible</i>

66
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,710
<i>for the abduction and unlawful
imprisonment of Rose Stagg.</i>

67
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,429
Last night, I received a phone
call on my old private number

68
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,539
from Rose Stagg's
mobile phone.

69
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,419
The call he made on Rose's phone

70
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,649
last night has been triangulated.

71
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,549
We have a location.
A search is under way.

72
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,759
We have a live cell trace on
Spector's registered mobile phone

73
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,939
and we have his historic
phone records.

74
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,499
Right now that phone is off

75
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,819
but we know he has access
to other phones.

76
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,920
He made calls in Scotland,
so we know he did go away.

77
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,899
Yesterday, he made
and received a call

78
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,429
in the vicinity of the
city hospital in Belfast,

79
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,239
so we know he's back.

80
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,549
Does he have a car?

81
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,209
He reported his car as stolen

82
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,349
the day after the Brawley murder.

83
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,469
It was a Peugeot 405.

84
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,169
Registration - sierra, India,
whisky, three, one, six, zero.

85
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,550
- Has he made an insurance claim?
- No.

86
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,100
We need to find that car.

87
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:17,019
DCI Matt Eastwood
is my new deputy SIO.

88
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,920
Thus far, he's been covering
the Rose Stagg disappearance.

89
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,959
We have some CCTV footage
that you may not have

90
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,950
seen of Rose shopping.

91
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,380
This is her last known
appearance in public.

92
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,279
All the evidence
thus far suggests

93
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,119
that Rose was
abducted from her home

94
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,949
by an individual who,

95
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,569
in conversation with Rose's
daughter, Nancy, aged six,

96
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,359
called himself Peter.

97
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,480
Now, on that point, we have
the suspect's birth certificate.

98
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,089
Peter Paul Spector.

99
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:56,669
Mother, Mary.
Father, John Paul Spector.

100
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,630
Note the occupation.
Private British Army.

101
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,709
He began an 18-month tour of duty
here in March 1978

102
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:06,369
with the Duke of
Cumbria's Regiment,

103
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,779
Third Battalion.

104
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,359
Now, Spector was born, as you can
see, on the 25th of May 1979.

105
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,039
The year the Shankill Butchers
were sentenced

106
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,119
to life imprisonment
for 19 murders,

107
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,130
the year of Warrenpoint.

108
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,300
A bad year.

109
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,879
Spector is a married man.
Married in 2004.

110
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,489
Sally-Ann Goodall.

111
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,590
He has two children -
Olivia, eight, and Liam, five.

112
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,099
Sally-Ann's a senior staff nurse

113
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,679
in the Belfast neo-natal
intensive care unit.

114
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,109
She leads a team that has
responsibility for 30 beds.

115
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,999
We have Sally-Ann under
surveillance

116
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,330
in the hope that she'll lead us
to her husband.

117
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,830
Our priority is to find him.

118
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,399
<i>Find him,
put him under surveillance</i>

119
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,470
<i>in the hope that he
will lead us to Rose.</i>

120
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:00,550
<i>We know next to nothing
about Paul Spector's childhood.</i>

121
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,789
All we have is a list of children's
homes that he himself provided.

122
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,450
All of those need to be checked out.

123
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,809
A man doesn't wake up
one morning

124
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,519
and find that he has become
a sexual psychopath.

125
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,839
Nor does he wake up one day and
discover that the condition has gone.

126
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,350
It develops over a very long
period of time.

127
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,470
<i>We need to find out everything that
we possibly can about Paul Spector.</i>

128
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,929
<i>Every detail of his life</i>

129
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,440
<i>needs to be established,
checked and double-checked.</i>

130
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:37,289
I also believe that Paul Spector
is responsible for the deaths

131
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:41,420
of Fiona Gallagher,
Alice Monroe and Sarah Kay.

132
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,229
I'd say all of his
previous victims

133
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,399
were dead within
an hour of being attacked.

134
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,399
She's lost to us already?

135
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,519
The one glimmer of hope
is that he knows Rose.

136
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,450
Not from watching and stalking,
objectifying her.

137
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,910
He really knows her.

138
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,170
And she's a mother.

139
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,450
<i>I feel sorry for you,</i>

140
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,950
I really do.

141
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,009
<i>You must have had
a terrible childhood</i>

142
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,040
<i>to be able to do this to me.</i>

143
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,770
<i>I feel sorry for you,</i>

144
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,250
<i>I really do.</i>

145
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,250
<i>I feel sorry for you.</i>

146
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,209
Pay a follow-up call
to Sally-Ann Spector.

147
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,899
Make it seem routine.

148
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,159
Ask her to account for the night
that she was at work

149
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,229
and Spector told us that he was
at home alone with the kids.

150
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,089
The night of the Joe
Brawley murder?

151
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,629
Just that night, though.
Don't spook her too much.

152
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,090
So just a little?

153
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,950
- Take McNally.
- Thank you, ma'am.

154
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,699
She wants me for herself,
really.

155
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,270
She's just being generous.

156
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,949
Do you carry that stuff about bombs
and shootings around in your head?

157
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,710
Etched on my soul.

158
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,139
X-Ray One to Control,

159
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,610
that's a CID car pulling
up at the target's address.

160
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,669
<i>Control, from X-Ray One.</i>

161
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,150
<i>CID car pulling up
at the target's address.</i>

162
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,690
That's two CID officers
at the target's door.

163
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,470
Female at the door,
possibly the target's wife.

164
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,910
Two CID officers enter the house.

165
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,650
Doors closed.

166
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,009
I don't know if you remember me,
Mrs Spector.

167
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,749
I spoke to you on the phone
a while ago.

168
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,439
Yes, I do remember.

169
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,059
I'm sorry to intrude like this,
but there are a few questions

170
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,339
I should have asked you
about the night of the 20th.

171
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,800
- What questions?
- They're just routine.

172
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,050
I should have asked you at the time.

173
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,190
You were working, you said?

174
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,739
I wasn't meant to be working
that night.

175
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,299
I'd been on all day.

176
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,949
We'd withdrawn care from one
of the babies in the unit

177
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,009
so I stayed with
the mother to see it through.

178
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,119
And Paul was at home
with the children?

179
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,129
He told my colleague
that he was at home

180
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,190
all evening and all night
with the children.

181
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,769
Bathed them, put them to bed,
read them a story.

182
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:50,190
He said that after that he was
in his study listening to music.

183
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,969
I'm not sure.

184
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,929
It's OK, Mrs Spector.

185
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,879
We just want to be able to eliminate
your husband from our enquiries

186
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,189
and move on.

187
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,090
Just tell us what you know.

188
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,130
A friend of mine...

189
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,380
A friend of mine picked up
the children from school.

190
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,839
She was looking after them
until nine.

191
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,190
She couldn't stay any longer.

192
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,139
So when I couldn't
get hold of Paul,

193
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,719
I called our usual baby-sitter.

194
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,650
She came and stayed the night.

195
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,550
She was gone when I got back
the following morning.

196
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,620
Paul was here.

197
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:40,009
Can I get those names from you,
Sally?

198
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,630
The friend?
The baby-sitter?

199
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,900
- Talk to you, ma'am?
- Yeah.

200
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:51,269
According to Mrs Spector,
a baby-sitter - Katerina Benedetto,

201
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,659
known as Katie -
was at the Spectors' house

202
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,529
on the night of the
Joe Brawley murder,

203
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:58,129
Not Spector himself.

204
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,459
- How old?
- 15 at the time,

205
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,939
just turned 16.

206
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,740
School student.

207
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,470
Should we talk to her?

208
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,439
Well, she'll need
one of her parents present.

209
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,939
Father's dead, motorcycle
accident three years ago.

210
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,869
He was an art dealer.

211
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,889
Mother works for an auction house.
Fine art -

212
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,529
paintings and stuff.

213
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,490
I know what fine art is.

214
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,970
Pay her a visit.

215
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,059
- Mrs Benedetto?
- Yes.

216
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,299
DC Martin, DC McNally.

217
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,219
We'd like to talk to
your daughter, Katerina.

218
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,689
Is she home?

219
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,810
- Yes, she is. Come on through.
- Thank you. Thanks.

220
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,710
Katie?

221
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,320
Katie!

222
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,450
These police officers
want to talk to you.

223
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,759
When did you start baby-sitting
for the Spectors, Katie?

224
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,569
When I was 14.

225
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,569
And you were baby-sitting
on the night of the 20th?

226
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,129
- And you stayed all night?
- No.

227
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,430
No?

228
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,569
- I left at about three in the morning.
- Really?

229
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,900
You were asleep
and didn't hear me come in.

230
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,419
Did you leave because
Mr Spector came home?

231
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,209
No. I left because we suddenly
realised the time

232
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,089
and he wanted to go to bed.

233
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,579
We?

234
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,950
Paul came home at about 9:30.

235
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,950
- 9:30?
- Yes. I see.

236
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,510
Then why did you stay?

237
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,569
We got talking,
listening to music in his study.

238
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,619
You were alone with Mr Spector
from 9:30 till 3am?

239
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,529
The children were there.

240
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,019
Have you stayed that
late at the Spectors' before?

241
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,320
No.

242
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,009
Where did Sally-Ann suggest
you should sleep that night?

243
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,349
She said to use their bed.

244
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,059
Did you use their bed?

245
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,270
I told you, Paul came home.

246
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,689
Where had he been?

247
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,859
Doing something related to work,
I think.

248
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,890
Helping one of his clients.

249
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,800
There was nothing unusual
about his appearance, his demeanour?

250
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,759
No, nothing.

251
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,069
So just to be clear,

252
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,749
you were
with Paul Spector from 9:30

253
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,710
- that night till after three the following morning?
- Yes.

254
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,649
How did you get home?

255
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,599
Paul wanted
to call a cab but I walked.

256
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,920
It's not far.

257
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:50,390
No, it's not.

258
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,290
We have Tom Stagg's house
under surveillance.

259
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,539
He was visited there last night
by Professor Reed Smith.

260
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,939
Really? How long did she stay?

261
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,240
Two hours.

262
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,399
There were some prolonged silences.

263
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,690
They seemed quite comfortable
with each other.

264
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,470
I see.

265
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,210
<i>- Yes?
- Where are you?</i>

266
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,339
Shopping
for clothes, thank you very much.

267
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,550
<i>The police have just been here.</i>

268
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,159
Really?

269
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,869
Asking about the night
that I was baby-sitting for you.

270
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,779
- What?
- If you want to know what I said,

271
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,719
- you'd better meet me.
<i>- Katie!</i>

272
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,090
<i>Katie, I need to talk to you.</i>

273
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,700
I'm on the phone!

274
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,319
Are you fucking with me?

275
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,010
DC Glenn Martin and
DC something or other McNally.

276
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:24,399
Meet me at nine.
<i>Cathedral Quarte</i>r.

277
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,700
Whereabouts?

278
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,790
I'll text you.

279
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,190
- We've just seen the baby-sitter, ma'am.
- How did it go?

280
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,559
She says Spector was at home
on the 20th.

281
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,850
His home, with her.
From 9:30 in the evening.

282
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,030
- What?
- Says she left at 3am.

283
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,910
So now he has an alibi?

284
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,899
She gave us the time
and the route of her journey home.

285
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,369
We can see if we can find anyone
to confirm her story.

286
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,089
What the fuck is
she playing at?

287
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,879
Why would she say that?

288
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,290
One thing she did reveal -

289
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,969
the night before Sarah Kay
was killed,

290
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,609
she was baby-sitting while the Spectors
were drinking with friends

291
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:05,130
in the bar of the Malmaison.

292
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,190
Right?

293
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:12,460
As was...
Annie Brawley.

294
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,839
<i>We are here today to appeal
for the public's help</i>

295
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,839
<i>in locating a missing woman,</i>

296
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,090
<i>Rose Veronica Stagg.</i>

297
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,279
Rose hasn't been seen,

298
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,239
nor has she contacted her family,

299
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,069
since the night of the 3rd of May

300
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,370
and we are concerned
for her welfare.

301
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,429
Rose is 32 years old

302
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,239
with dark,
shoulder-length hair

303
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,380
which can appear black when wet.

304
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,509
She can be seen here
in a family video

305
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,650
that was shot three weeks ago.

306
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,030
Ma'am.

307
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,780
<i>I think mine is definitely
better than yours, though.</i>

308
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,040
<i>I got one, two, three, four.</i>

309
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,529
<i>I'm making this one for you, Tom.</i>

310
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,690
<i>I think it's going
to suit you beautifully.</i>

311
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:42,080
<i>- Nancy, you going to make one for Brody?
- OK.</i>

312
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,990
<i>What do you think of my work?</i>

313
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:49,809
<i>Rose's car has also gone missing.</i>

314
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,630
<i>Details of the vehicle
will appear on the screen shortly.</i>

315
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:56,950
<i>This is Rose's husband, Tom,
here beside me.</i>

316
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,440
<i>Tom would like to say a few words.</i>

317
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,100
<i>Thank you so much
for watching today.</i>

318
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:07,249
<i>I'm appealing to anyone
who might have any information</i>

319
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,680
<i>about the disappearance
of my wife, Rose,</i>

320
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:13,980
<i>to contact the police any time,
day or night.</i>

321
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:18,660
<i>Rose is a therapeutic
radiologist by profession.</i>

322
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:24,430
<i>Many of her patients are suffering
from advanced forms of cancer.</i>

323
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:29,190
<i>It would be completely out of character for
Rose to leave those patients in the lurch.</i>

324
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,730
I know she would call me
if she could,

325
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,959
which makes me think she might be
being held somewhere

326
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,260
against her will.

327
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,290
I know she's alive.

328
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,470
She can't...

329
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,780
Ma'am.

330
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,679
We have tyre tracks, ma'am.

331
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,989
They match the track width

332
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,550
and wheelbase of Rose Stagg's car.

333
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:37,539
- Any sign of the phone?
- Not yet.

334
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,890
We're losing light.

335
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,680
Fuck you, Stella.
Fuck you.

336
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,900
Fucking bitch.

337
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,959
X-Ray One to Control, stand by.

338
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,349
<i>Target's wife out of the house
with two children.</i>

339
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:07,990
<i>Approaching green Volvo Estate. Uniform,
echo, Zulu, eight, two, four, three.</i>

340
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,089
<i>Vehicle facing countrywards.</i>

341
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,569
Call signs stand by,

342
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:14,129
target's wife and two children
<i>in green Volvo.</i>

343
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,850
Alpha, do you have target
vehicle?

344
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,210
Alpha. I have.

345
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,110
<i>Control. Alpha has.</i>

346
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,549
Anything?

347
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:33,439
There's no sign of the car, ma'am.
There is no such number.

348
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,300
Did you get a make or a model?

349
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,450
Check on the PNC for recently
stolen vehicles.

350
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,450
- Gibson.
<i>- Hi. It's Reed Smith.</i>

351
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,650
Hi.

352
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,940
<i>Can I see you?</i>

353
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,180
- When?
<i>- Tonight?</i>

354
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,209
Is ten too late?

355
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:59,600
<i>No. It's fine.
Where?</i>

356
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,199
Bert's Bar.

357
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,090
<i>Perfect.
I'll see you there.</i>

358
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,140
Ma'am.

359
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,200
Stolen this morning.

360
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,900
Right.

361
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,280
That's it.

362
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,100
Where was it stolen from?

363
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,980
From here, ma'am.

364
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,060
Ma'am.
We've found something.

365
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,570
It's not the phone,
it's a phone case.

366
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,980
I'm joining someone.

367
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,740
She's there.

368
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,700
I don't have much time.

369
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,140
Tell me what happened.

370
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:15,309
The thing is, I really did
walk home alone at three.

371
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,289
I gave them the exact route.

372
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:20,510
There were people who saw me,
there's CCTV along the way.

373
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,370
So if they check up,
they'll see it's true.

374
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,630
Are you pleased with me?

375
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,879
Not particularly.

376
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,279
- Why are you being like this?
- Like what?

377
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,290
I'm protecting you.

378
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,559
I don't need your protection.

379
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,460
Yes, you do.

380
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,960
And now you have to tell me.

381
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,070
Tell you?

382
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,779
The truth about you.

383
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:51,490
The truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

384
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,299
Being a serial murderer
is a form of slow suicide,

385
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,939
deeply self-destructive.

386
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,780
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Katie,
but that's not my style.

387
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,420
Then what are you?

388
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,690
Who are you?

389
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,580
I'm lots of things.

390
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,510
So am I.

391
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,160
You?

392
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,819
You're a stereotype.

393
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,829
The rebellious teenager.

394
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,600
I'm much more than that.

395
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,550
Do you ever find yourself
a day behind?

396
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,529
What do you mean?

397
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:36,309
Or look at the clock and see
that hours have gone by

398
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,419
and you have no idea what
you were doing?

399
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,720
I don't know.

400
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,770
- Are you always just little Katie?
- No.

401
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,490
When aren't you little Katie?

402
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,100
When I'm with you.

403
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,650
I've pretended to be other
people online.

404
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,940
Who?

405
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:00,050
Different names.
Older. A guy.

406
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,210
Then maybe you will understand.

407
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,350
Try me.

408
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,420
I hadn't taken much notice
of the case,

409
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,190
the various murders.

410
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,339
But then one evening

411
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,540
we were driving home from a meeting
with one of Olivia's teachers

412
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,620
when we were diverted
away from a crime scene.

413
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,599
I went home and looked up
the news

414
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,959
to see what happened.

415
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,660
There'd been a murder. Sarah Kay.

416
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,300
- You know I go running?
- Yes.

417
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,339
Sometimes I run through the city.

418
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:59,669
But sometimes I run through the
botanic gardens and I head south.

419
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:03,329
When I take that route,
I run through the graveyard.

420
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,979
A couple of days after the murder,

421
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,859
the police had
reopened the street.

422
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:10,939
I went that way. And running along
the path through the gravestones,

423
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,750
something caught my eye.

424
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,220
It was a driver's licence.

425
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:20,050
So I stopped and picked it up
and it was Sarah Kay's.

426
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,429
I looked at the address,

427
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,990
I saw that she lived
opposite the cemetery.

428
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:30,610
So then I began to wonder -
had she dropped it

429
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,700
or had the killer discarded it?

430
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,920
Had the killer passed that way?

431
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,459
My God.

432
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,160
So there I am,
holding this driving licence

433
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,510
and I'm thinking,
"I should go to the police."

434
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,020
But then I found I didn't want to.

435
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,200
Why?

436
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,710
Did you see the first press
conference?

437
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,170
- No.
- The one for Sarah Kay?

438
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,980
No.

439
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,979
Well, there's this woman,
an English woman.

440
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,849
And it seemed that she was the one
that linked the murders

441
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,810
and that she was in charge.

442
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,580
That's her.

443
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,250
What I noticed at the conference,

444
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,520
her blouse, a silk blouse,

445
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,820
was open here.

446
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,580
Gaping open.

447
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:44,020
She seemed so cool, so relaxed,
so self-assured.

448
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,119
Superior.

449
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,459
While the Irishman sat next to her
looked like a potato.

450
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,100
A farmer.
Like a dope.

451
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,720
And I thought,
"Fuck you, you English bitch."

452
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:03,350
So I kept it, didn't hand it in.

453
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,869
Which is maybe just as well,
given that you were in the park

454
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,980
at the same time as
her and her sister.

455
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:16,200
The more I thought about that woman,
Stella Gibson,

456
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:19,800
the more I wanted to fuck with her
and her investigation.

457
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:24,400
So I wrote a letter pretending
to be the killer.

458
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,330
And to prove that I was the killer,

459
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:30,190
I enclosed the driver's licence.

460
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,740
You did that?

461
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,200
And they bought it,
hook, line and sinker.

462
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,150
Are you still messing with her?

463
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,090
I have one more thing I want to do.

464
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,259
- Tell me.
- No.

465
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:06,200
Let me do it with you. Please.

466
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,869
- You're not ready.
- I am.

467
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,779
I am ready for anything.

468
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,310
You think I'm a little girl,
but I'm not.

469
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,550
Ask me to do anything and I will.

470
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,799
Create a fake e-mail account,

471
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,609
use it
to create a video chat account.

472
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:37,899
Text me the details
using that phone.

473
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,200
That's it?

474
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:43,020
No, there's a lot more
to do than that.

475
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,820
I wanted to say that I was sorry.

476
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:12,509
Questioning you about the scratches.

477
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,250
I didn't need to do that.

478
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,709
You were just doing your job.

479
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,790
It was more than that.

480
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,150
I was, I don't know, prying.

481
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,900
It's OK.

482
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,150
I saw Tom on the television.

483
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,600
- Yeah.
- He did well.

484
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,730
I helped him choose
the video clips of Rose.

485
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:40,850
I didn't realise that you were
so close to the family.

486
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,449
What do you mean?

487
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,750
To Tom.

488
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:50,150
I'm told you seem quite
comfortable in his company.

489
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:55,600
Am I being watched?

490
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:59,850
- No.
- But Tom is?

491
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:04,899
Are the police spying on him?

492
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,549
You know as well as I do that

493
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:08,429
the first person the police look at

494
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:11,250
in a case like this is
the boyfriend or the husband.

495
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:14,299
He's not responsible
for Rose going missing.

496
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,600
No, I know.

497
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:19,250
We are.

498
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,019
X-Ray One, stand by.

499
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,629
Unknown approaching
target address. Hood up.

500
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,539
Control, X-Ray One, stand by.

501
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,649
<i>Unknown approaching target address.
Hood up.</i>

502
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:06,319
<i>Is it a possible for target?</i>

503
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,729
X-Ray One to Control.

504
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:10,129
Unable to say, dark clothes.

505
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:12,360
May be smaller than target's height.

506
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:18,929
Moving towards the alleyway
at side of target's house.

507
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:21,859
<i>Control. Delta,
move closer to drop-off two.</i>

508
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,209
<i>OK.</i>

509
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:26,340
- Two, give me a walk past.
- Copy.

510
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:01,490
From Two. Unknown climbing over
rear wall, wait out.

511
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:10,250
Entering through rear door.

512
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,290
I should take this.
Sorry.

513
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,150
Gibson.

514
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:35,270
Yes, go ahead.

515
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:43,109
<i>Control -
all signs stand by,</i>

516
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,929
<i>unknown leaving target
address.</i>

517
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:46,230
Follow.

518
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:59,150
<i>Target's now on
Newtown Road, ma'am.</i>

519
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:02,320
- Where's that?
<i>- University Quarter.</i>

520
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:03,630
Right.

521
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:14,019
From three, target is female,
<i>16, 17 years old,</i>

522
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,930
entering Edson Avenue.

523
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,750
From five, I now have.

524
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:36,969
<i>- Hello, ma'am?</i>
- Yeah, I'm here.

525
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:41,129
Target went into a house
on Edson Avenue, number 16.

526
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:43,969
<i>We are trying to ascertain
who resides there.</i>

527
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:45,590
I know that address.

528
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,550
That sounds like it could be
the Benedetto girl...

529
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:53,110
Katie.

530
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:59,620
I'm sorry, I couldn't help but notice
you sitting over here all by yourself.

531
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,039
I wasn't sure what you were drinking

532
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,890
but a good margarita is
always acceptable, I think.

533
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:08,790
I'm Michael Day, Bacon
and Day Solicitors.

534
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:12,140
How lovely for you.

535
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:14,480
What do you do?

536
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:16,870
I'm a pathologist...

537
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:20,619
..from the Ancient Greek "pathos",
meaning disease,

538
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:22,499
and "logos", meaning a treatise.

539
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,450
I study disease, death
being the final disease.

540
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:29,990
Now I'm thinking you must
be Professor Reed Smith.

541
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:33,650
I had no idea...beauty and brains.

542
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:36,510
Sorry I'm late.

543
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:40,850
It's nice to see you.

544
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:43,390
Oh, nice to see you too.

545
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:55,570
Thanks, keep them coming.

546
00:45:57,770 --> 00:46:00,770
I'm, erm, I'm not the waiter.

547
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:03,400
Well, why are you standing there?

548
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:11,770
That was nice.

549
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:15,849
Yes, it was. He knows who I am.

550
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:17,850
I dare say he knows who you are.

551
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:20,150
So, what?!

552
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:42,150
Oh, God, what am I doing?

553
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:46,290
Going with the flow.

554
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:50,270
I can't...

555
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:54,450
I can't.

556
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:56,890
I was brought up in Croydon.

557
00:46:57,290 --> 00:46:59,480
What's that supposed to mean?

558
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,130
Look, I'm sorry...

559
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:05,350
I'm sorry.

560
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:42,849
Jim.

561
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:44,150
Stella,

562
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:47,030
can I come in?

563
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:50,050
Five minutes.

564
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:53,350
- Why?
- Five minutes, please.

565
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:01,409
How did you know I was here?

566
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:03,350
Why wouldn't you be here?

567
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:06,609
Have you been drinking?

568
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,250
I have indeed.

569
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:15,170
- Do you have ice?
- No...

570
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:16,880
how
many years has it been?

571
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,550
What?

572
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:24,590
..five years...

573
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,050
this Christmas.

574
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:31,810
Shouldn't you be
phoning your sponsor?

575
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:39,680
I just had a call from Eastwood.

576
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:43,570
Aaron Monroe is back in custody.

577
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:47,759
Made an attempt to kill his father
in hospital,

578
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,250
- his own father!
- Really?

579
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:52,390
It was me

580
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:54,689
who tipped off Morgan

581
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:57,119
that Eastwood had warrants
out for his son.

582
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,939
Jim, I don't need to know this.

583
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:01,599
I was trying to outmanoeuvre
Monroe senior

584
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:05,609
to make his position on the Policing
Executive untenable.

585
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:09,179
If Aaron knows and tells
Eastwood that it was me

586
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:12,370
who tipped the father off,
I'm finished!

587
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:21,990
You know what he said
to me...Eastwood?

588
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:25,350
He called me a weak man!

589
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:27,689
Can you believe that?!

590
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:29,820
A weak man!

591
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:41,290
I have been weak.

592
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:46,220
I am weak.

593
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:53,990
Oh, Stella!

594
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:03,459
- I want you so badly.
- Don't,

595
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,519
Jim...
seriously, don't.

596
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,579
- Please, Stella.
- No.

597
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:10,049
Just one night,
just one night.

598
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:11,629
I need to forget the shit,

599
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:13,589
- all the shit I've seen.
- No, Jim...

600
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:15,199
- Please, oh, please...
- Come on.
Jim. Please... Stop!

601
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,669
- Please...
- Jim, Stop!

602
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:18,039
Please, please...

603
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,419
- Please!
- Jim.

604
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:20,870
Please, please, Stella...

605
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:23,710
For fuck's sake!

606
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:43,319
Today at the briefing I saw a list
of the children's homes that

607
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,520
Spector says he attended.

608
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:48,760
One of those homes I got to
know,

609
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:51,390
I got to know very well.

610
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,580
Run by a paedophile.

611
00:51:55,450 --> 00:52:00,150
Father Fiachra Jensen,
a man of my faith, Stella.

612
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:01,910
Keep still.

613
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:04,900
A man in a position of power,

614
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,510
wielding moral authority.

615
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:11,759
His idea of midnight mass?

616
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,889
Soixante-neuf with an altar boy,
behind the altar,

617
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:18,550
in full vestments...
unholy orders.

618
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:22,390
What a fall from grace.

619
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:29,150
I was the arresting officer.

620
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:34,150
Decades later, the
lives of the victims...

621
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:38,110
..blighted by depression and
addiction,

622
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:43,870
broken marriages,
self-harm, suicide...

623
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:49,470
Maybe this murderous fuck
is a victim too?

624
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:52,070
Maybe.

625
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:05,089
Why are women emotionally
and spiritually

626
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:07,150
so much stronger than men?

627
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:13,350
Because the basic human
form is female.

628
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:17,090
Maleness is...

629
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:20,690
a kind
of birth defect.

630
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:27,590
Stella.

631
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:31,250
You look at me like you looked
at that bottle of Scotch,

632
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:34,350
a mixture of fear and anger.

633
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:38,410
I don't like it.

634
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:29,050
Have you had a good evening?

635
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:32,090
Yes, thanks...
you?

636
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:35,390
It's been fun.

637
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:42,010
How did it feel,
breaking in?

638
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:44,750
<i>Thrilling!</i>

639
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:49,350
<i>What's my reward?</i>

640
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:51,300
What would you like?

641

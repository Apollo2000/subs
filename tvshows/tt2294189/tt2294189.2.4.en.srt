1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,559
You went to the police, Rose.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,349
Maybe it was some other girl?
Some other girl you were seeing?

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,900
There was no other girl.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,159
Our prime suspect,
Paul Spector.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,469
We need to find him.

6
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,839
Put him under surveillance
and hope that he leads us

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,129
to Rose before it's too late.

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,489
So,
just to be clear,

9
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,189
you were with Paul Spector
from 9.30pm that night

10
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,219
until after 3.00am
the following morning.

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,259
- Yes.
- We've found something.

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,209
It's not the phone,
it's a phone case.

13
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,560
- God. What am I doing?
- Going with the flow.

14
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,099
- Are you pleased with me?
- Not particularly.

15
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,469
- I'm protecting you.
- I don't need your protection.

16
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,779
- Please.
- Stop.

17
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,380
Please, please, Stella!

18
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,100
- Have you had a good evening?
- Yes, thanks.

19
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,960
- You?
- It's been fun.

The Fall
Season 2 - Episode 04

23
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,320
"Strangler"

24
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,159
Rick,
I need a new laptop.

25
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,539
- Where's yours?
In an evidence bag.

26
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,350
- What?
- Long story.

27
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,980
How do I log in on this?

28
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,080
Thanks.

29
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,860
Ma'am?

30
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,100
One second.

31
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,440
That car you saw up on the hill
with the changed plates?

32
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,639
It was stolen from here.

33
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,969
That was the morning after
the phone call

34
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,250
and close to where the
cover of Rose's phone was found.

35
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,880
And there is the Goodall Farm.

36
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,510
We should get a helicopter up,
Ged.

37
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,099
One with thermal imaging.

38
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,609
Looking particularly for remote
outbuildings,

39
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,010
anything that could be
a potential hiding place.

40
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,109
Anywhere he could be keeping Rose
Stagg or Rose Stagg's remains.

41
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,410
Yes, ma'am.

42
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,359
# Comes a time

43
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,770
# my lover sees

44
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,640
# My heart is draped in willow leaves

45
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,419
# Then you came in from the garden

46
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,940
# In the evening away from the rain

47
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,180
# And it begins again... #

48
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,339
I need to talk to you
about last night.

49
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,060
I have something to show you.

50
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,380
Come around.

51
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,460
This is taken from the CCTV camera
on the corridor of my hotel.

52
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,729
That's my room

53
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,930
- at 2214.
- Who is it?

54
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,770
I believe it's Paul Spector.

55
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,400
And that's me,
entering my room just after 11.

56
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,150
Are you telling me
he was in there with you?

57
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,780
Been in there for 45 minutes

58
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,220
It gets better

59
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,359
That's you arriving
just after 11.

60
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,120
- He was in there with both of us?
- And that's him leaving.

61
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,699
- Note the time.
- Where the hell was he?

62
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,920
There's only one place
he could have been.

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,300
In there.

64
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,940
That's where we
had our...misunderstanding.

65
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,850
- God.
- And then we were there.

66
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,489
I suppose when I was cleaning
your face is when he slipped away.

67
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,799
So he heard me.

68
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,670
Oh, forget your private
embarrassment for a minute.

69
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,100
You were talking about
Father Whatever he calls himself.

70
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,229
And I'm pretty sure that you
referred to Spector by name.

71
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,890
- Are you certain?
- Not certain.

72
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,130
But if you did,

73
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,440
he knows that
we're on to him.

74
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,049
Standby from Five.

75
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,699
That's the Benedetto girl
leaving 16 Edson Avenue

76
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,499
with an unknown female, similar age.

77
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,409
<i>Control. Benedetto girl leaving
16 Edson Avenue</i>

78
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,610
<i>with unknown female, similar age.</i>

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,509
Oh, I'm so not up for this.
I've had, like, two hours' sleep.

80
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,550
- Same.
- How come?

81
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,860
- I had dinner with Paul.
- Really?

82
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,290
- Yes.
- And?

83
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,050
- It was amazing.
- What happened?

84
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,369
- We talked.
- What happened after?

85
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,789
- I came home.
- Why?

86
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,209
Did he go home to his wife?

87
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,009
I told you,
he's left his wife.

88
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,310
Yeah, sure.

89
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,889
That was us last night.
I don't see his wife anywhere.

90
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,850
Oh, my God! Let me see.
Katie! You recorded him?

91
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,490
- Were you doing the same?
- Maybe.

92
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,189
- What if he recorded you?
- I don't think he's like that.

93
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,720
No, of course not!
Let me see.

94
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,120
I suppose in his mind
that must be me.

95
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,850
Which makes that thing him?

96
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,560
He also read my dream diary.

97
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,980
- What?
- I keep a journal.

98
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,640
He left an entry for me.

99
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,950
Does your journal contain
procedural stuff?

100
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,390
I've trained myself to wake up and
write down dreams, passing thoughts.

101
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,509
I did it first as an
investigative thing

102
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,560
but now I can't stop doing it.

103
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,480
It's not procedural.

104
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,650
It's personal.

105
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,860
And now it's lost to me,
seized as evidence.

106
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,990
Modern life is
such an unholy mix

107
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,459
of voyeurism and exhibitionism.

108
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,449
People perpetually
broadcasting

109
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,350
their internal and
external selves.

110
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,959
My diary is private.

111
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,700
It is not intended for publication.

112
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,199
Do you think if I hadn't turned up
last night,

113
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,500
he would have...

114
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,849
Do you think he was planning
to attack you?

115
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,880
Is that how you see yourself?

116
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,960
As my protector?

117
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,940
I came here to apologise.

118
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,820
No.

119
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,700
There's no need.

120
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,009
I nearly made the same
mistake as you last night.

121
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,310
You did?

122
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,439
We all have physical,
emotional needs

123
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,060
that can only be met
by interaction with another person.

124
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,800
The trick is to ask someone
appropriate to meet them.

125
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,020
Why can't you marry your daddy?

126
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,449
Do you mean why can't little girls
marry their daddies?

127
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,750
Yes.

128
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,860
- Do you want to marry Daddy?
- Can I?

129
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,470
He's already married.
To me.

130
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,990
- He's taken.
- But if you don't want him?

131
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,939
Someday when you're
older like Mummy

132
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,120
you can marry a
nice man like Daddy.

133
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,599
X-Ray One.
That's the target's wife

134
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,459
arriving home with
the two children.

135
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,169
<i>Control.
From X-Ray One -</i>

136
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,890
<i>target's wife arriving home
with the two children.</i>

137
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,219
Looks like Spector's
qualifications

138
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,029
as a counsellor are for real.

139
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,339
They were pretty
thoroughly checked out

140
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,449
when he was first employed
by the local authority.

141
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,409
Two main things to follow up on.

142
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,349
Spector had been counselling
a married couple,

143
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,089
James and Elizabeth Tyler.

144
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,739
Their son died of meningitis.
Ten years old.

145
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,679
James Tyler, Jimmy,
is well known to us.

146
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,959
Seems that James,
following the death of his son,

147
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,669
became a bit free with his fists

148
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,469
as far as Liz was concerned.

149
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,489
Spector advised
Liz to report him

150
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,219
to the Domestic Violence Unit.

151
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,699
She was reluctant.

152
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,509
James was out of prison on licence.

153
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,829
Anything like that would put him
back inside.

154
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,459
Spector was persuasive,
Liz made the call.

155
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,440
She's now in a woman's
refuge in Bangor somewhere.

156
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,289
- Is James back in prison?
- Out on bail.

157
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,039
- Tagged with curfew conditions.
- Pay her a visit.

158
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,049
Don't let anyone else
see that address.

159
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,149
- No, ma'am.
- Spector had a run

160
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,789
in with James Tyler
about an unscheduled house call

161
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,749
he made on Liz
when she was home alone.

162
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,509
Chandler and his boss had occasion
to reprimand Spector.

163
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:57,829
This was on the day
of the Joe Brawley murder.

164
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,769
Spector behaved bizarrely,
walked out.

165
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,050
Never came back, disappeared.

166
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,990
- Behaved bizarrely?
- Yes.

167
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,690
How?

168
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,600
How?

169
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,459
- That's what I said.
- That's what I said.

170
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,879
- What?
- What?

171
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,439
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing what he did.

172
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,320
What are you doing?

173
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,349
I see.
Mirroring?

174
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,490
Spector is still registered as a
freelance bereavement counsellor.

175
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,260
So that would be fine art,
would it?

176
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,370
Yes, it would.

177
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,860
Rick?

178
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,069
The Alice Monroe Fund
sent a bereavement counsellor

179
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,029
- to talk to Annie Brawley.
- Right.

180
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,180
Do we have his or
her name on file?

181
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,719
I don't seem to have that
information.

182
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,800
I know the fund found someone
accredited and approved.

183
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,249
Who's guarding Annie today?

184
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,550
Hagstrom?

185
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,630
Can you get her on the phone?

186
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,680
- Are you finished?
- Yes.

187
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,580
Go play.

188
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,009
<i>The hairdresser's just arrived.</i>

189
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,399
What hairdresser?

190
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,709
Oh, that's something her therapist
organised for Annie.

191
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,250
<i>Which therapist?</i>

192
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,099
The new one.

193
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,520
Mr. Spector, the bereavement
counsellor.

194
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,499
How many times has
he been in to see her?

195
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,800
<i>Once.</i>

196
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,919
<i>But a second appointment
is arranged for this afternoon.</i>

197
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,320
- When?
<i>- In just over half an hour.</i>

198
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,409
I'm on my way.

199
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:21,520
Don't allow Spector to see her
under any circumstances.

200
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,729
<i>This is Paul Spector,
leave a message.</i>

201
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,789
God, Paul.
Why is your phone always off?

202
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,380
I need to speak to you.

203
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,619
- Gibson.
<i>- Control, ma'am.</i>

204
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,569
<i>We have surveillance
at the hospital in place.</i>

205
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,969
<i>We have all entrances covered</i>

206
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,759
<i>and will let you know as soon
as anyone has eyes on the target.</i>

207
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,060
Very good.

208
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,050
There's something I need you to do.

209
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,490
X-Ray One. That's the target's wife
coming out of the house
with the children.

210
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,209
<i>Control.
Call signs standby.</i>

211
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,519
<i>From X-Ray One -</i>

212
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,010
<i>target's wife coming
out of the house with children.</i>

213
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,939
Vehicle moving citywards.

214
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,909
<i>'From Control - target's wife
heading city wards in Volvo.</i>

215
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,840
<i>All call signs respond.</i>

216
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,960
<i>From Delta, I have.
Following.</i>

217
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,280
<i>Control.
Delta has.</i>

218
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,499
- Is it looking OK?
- It is.

219
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,449
But I'm going to have to ask
you to stop for the day.

220
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:51,960
- I haven't finished.
- We'll call to reschedule.

221
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,180
Thank you.

222
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,099
Annie, I have to move
you out of this room.

223
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,900
- Why?
- I don't have time to explain.

224
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,080
From Eight - that's the target
crossing reception.

225
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,680
Relax.
It will be OK.

226
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,509
From Eight -
the target is ascending now.

227
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:36,280
I repeat, ascending now.

228
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,689
<i>Ma'am, the target is
ascending in the lift.</i>

229
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,279
OK.

230
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,720
What's happening?

231
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,950
Please tell me what's going on?

232
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,920
Mr. Spector.

233
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,890
PC Hagstrom.
We met before.

234
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,159
Yes.

235
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,159
I think you were due to have
another counselling session

236
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,800
- with Annie today?
- Where is she?

237
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,430
I'm afraid she's having
some more treatment.

238
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,609
What sort of treatment?

239
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:21,109
For her throat, I think.
Her voice box.

240
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,369
She didn't seem to have
any trouble with her voice

241
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,759
when she talking to me.

242
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,410
When I first met her
she couldn't speak at all.

243
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,500
- When will I be able to see her again?
- I'm not sure.

244
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,709
A hairdresser was booked to see
Annie today.

245
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,410
She's been cancelled, too.

246
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,250
- By phone?
- Yeah.

247
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,550
But you let me come all the way
in here before turning me away?

248
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,820
We tried your phone
but we couldn't get through.

249
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,150
Actually, let me check.
What number do we have for you?

250
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,140
It's OK.

251
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,089
- Yes.
<i>- It's control, ma'am.</i>

252
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,229
<i>The target's wife is approaching
the hospital.</i>

253
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,539
She's coming here?

254
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,549
<i>Entering by the main entrance,
ma'am.</i>

255
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,850
OK.

256
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,620
I was due to see Mr. Spector.
But is he the target?

257
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,320
<i>It's Hagstrom.
All clear.</i>

258
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,200
Paul?

259
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,960
Paul!

260
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,560
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see you.

261
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,019
How did you know I'd be here?

262
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,029
I opened a letter addressed to you
confirming your appointment.

263
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,479
You're opening my letters now?

264
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,069
Your phone's never on.

265
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,370
It's broken.

266
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,799
We need to talk, Paul.

267
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,020
Olivia misses you,
Liam needs a father.

268
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,140
Paul?

269
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,600
- Paul?
- OK.

270
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,300
What?

271
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,850
Let's...

272
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,049
- Where are the kids?
- At a party.

273
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,680
Have you got your car?

274
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,480
OK, let's go.

275
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,769
<i>From Eight - that's the target and
wife walking to the pedestrian exit.</i>

276
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,929
<i>From Seven - I have.</i>

277
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:48,799
<i>Control. Target and wife walking
towards the pedestrian exit.</i>

278
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,359
<i>- Seven has.</i>
- Gibson.

279
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,059
<i>It's Ferrington.</i>

280
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,609
Responding to an
emergency call, ma'am.

281
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,999
<i>- Yes?
- A body has been found.</i>

282
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,640
<i>A female.</i>

283
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,869
- Where?
<i>- The Belfast Hills.</i>

284
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,150
<i>Divis.
In woodland.</i>

285
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,830
- Are you at the scene?
<i>- On our way.</i>

286
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,539
- What else do we know?
<i>- The body is face down.</i>

287
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,499
<i>Young, late 20s, early 30s,
possibly.</i>

288
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,910
<i>- Dark hair.</i>
- Cause of death?

289
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,499
<i>There's talk of a ligature.</i>

290
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,550
<i>The SIO at the scene thought
you should be informed, ma'am.</i>

291
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,419
In any serious crime inquiry

292
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,329
there are always people
who become of interest

293
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,219
to the investigation team.

294
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,570
Most of them
are eventually ruled out.

295
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,280
One such person is your therapist.

296
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,500
- I really liked him.
- Tell me why.

297
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,480
He made me feel better about myself.

298
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,600
In what way "better"?

299
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,740
I know it was only the once...

300
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,900
..but he was the most helpful
anyone's been.

301
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:12,700
Why, do you think?

302
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,850
He just seemed...

303
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,760
He just listened.

304
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,679
He was almost like a mirror.

305
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,050
He seemed to reflect me
back somehow.

306
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,220
He wasn't judgmental.

307
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,780
I see.

308
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,900
Annie.

309
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,730
You must not discuss this

310
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,650
or talk about him

311
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,960
with anyone.

312
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,630
Not family or friends,

313
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,440
no-one.

314
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,020
- You're scaring me.
- Don't be scared.

315
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,469
We will protect you

316
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:09,000
properly from now on,

317
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,840
move you somewhere secure.

318
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,430
Now I need to go.

319
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,280
But I will be in touch very soon.

320
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,480
My God.

321
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,780
He was there.
I remember him.

322
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,790
<i>Where?</i>

323
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,920
<i>In that bar.</i>

324
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,380
The night I lost
my driver's licence.

325
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,660
He's the man that attacked me!

326
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,409
<i>We just want to ask you
a few questions.</i>

327
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:08,140
- About James?
- In part about James.

328
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,670
It's lovely here.

329
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,199
I know. I can't believe it.

330
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,160
I have the room at the top, at the
front, looking out at the sea.

331
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,339
Does anyone else
know I'm here?

332
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,230
We're being very careful.

333
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,310
He has people,

334
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,980
people that watch out for him.

335
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,700
They're his eyes and ears.

336
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,599
<i>From Bravo - the target
and wife travelling south on M1,</i>

337
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,950
<i>heading towards Lisburn.
Following.</i>

338
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,529
<i>From Delta -
I have reflective on car,</i>

339
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,279
<i>target's wife driving.</i>

340
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,419
<i>From Control - target
and wife travelling south on M1</i>

341
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,959
<i>towards Lisburn.
All call signs respond.</i>

342
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,739
<i>- Burns.</i>
- We have him, Jim. We have him.

343
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,110
<i>- Where is he?</i>
- Travelling in a car with his wife.

344
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,409
<i>We mustn't lose him, Stella,
under no circumstances.</i>

345
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:08,649
<i>If we are letting him run in the
hope that he leads us to Rose,</i>

346
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,239
<i>we must not lose him.</i>

347
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,649
They found another body,
have you heard?

348
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:16,750
<i>- Female?</i>
- Yes. I'm on my way.

349
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,449
And so it was Paul Spector
who suggested you called

350
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,709
the police about
your husband's behaviour?

351
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:25,069
He said I had a right
to feel safe

352
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,480
- in my own home.
- I see.

353
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:32,300
I told him I started it with
James, I provoked him.

354
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,030
But Paul said the fault
was always with the abuser,

355
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,530
not the abused.

356
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,190
Did he put pressure on you
to make that call?

357
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:46,160
No, not really.

358
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,279
He called at your house
unannounced?

359
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,020
Just the once.

360
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,880
Why would he do that?

361
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,600
We'd missed some sessions.

362
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,890
He was worried.

363
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,760
What happened during that visit?

364
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,330
We talked.

365
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,880
I showed him my son's room.

366
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,980
Why?

367
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,220
At first,

368
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,799
after I lost Daniel,

369
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,620
I wasn't able to go in there,

370
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,960
but then I did.

371
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,800
I wanted Paul to see it.

372
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,110
What happened in Daniel's bedroom?

373
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,390
Was there physical
contact between you?

374
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,640
I asked him to hold me.

375
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,120
- And did he?
- Yes.

376
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,470
Did anything happen more
than Paul Spector holding you?

377
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,320
No.

378
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,880
No.

379
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,200
I wanted it to.

380
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,860
But no.

381
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,600
- Have you seen her?
- No, ma'am.

382
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,320
- They found the body?
- Yes, ma'am.

383
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,040
Take me up to the scene.

384
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,349
- Gibson.
<i>- It's me.</i>

385
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,659
<i>We have permission
to go into the Spector house.</i>

386
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,360
<i>Intrusive surveillance.
Are you at the scene?</i>

387
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:26,629
<i>- Is it Rose Stagg?</i>
- I don't know yet.

388
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,890
<i>- Keep me informed.</i>
- Yes, sir.

389
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,739
Who's been in there already,
apart from the first officers?

390
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,340
The Force Medical Officer's
been in to confirm death.

391
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:38,119
Who's the senior
investigating officer?

392
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,680
He is, ma'am.

393
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,050
I was told you were
on your way, ma'am.

394
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,150
DS Tom Anderson.

395
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,429
I've ordered emergency lighting
and a scene tent.

396
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,869
I can't see any tyre marks

397
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,579
but we've established
a common approach path

398
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,229
that I think avoids
the most likely entry/exit routes

399
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:02,130
used by the victim
and/or the offender.

400
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,249
It was you who thought
of my missing person?

401
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,779
Yes, ma'am.

402
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,440
What state of dress/undress
is she in?

403
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,990
She's dressed.

404
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,220
- Tom Anderson?
- Yes, ma'am.

405
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,559
Are you sure you're all right
to do this?

406
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,310
Yeah, I am.

407
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,949
Here's a suit for you,
ma'am.

408
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,250
Thank you.

409
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,300
Hair's the right colour and length.

410
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,280
Considerable lividity
in her lower limbs.

411
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,589
<i>Rigor mortis</i> has passed.

412
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:48,409
Probably more than 36 hours
since she died.

413
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,690
OK, let's turn her.

414
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,090
Right.
One, two, three.

415
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,139
Is it her?
Is it Rose?

416
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,609
I can't tell,
there's too much mud.

417
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,430
I don't think it is.

418
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,730
- Check her pockets.
- Wait.

419
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,919
Rose had a difficult first delivery.

420
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,480
She had a midline
longitudinal Caesarean.

421
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,490
- It's not her.
- Are you sure?

422
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,580
It's not Rose.

423
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,850
She was hanging...

424
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,190
..and her ligature gave way.

425
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,290
Always look up at a crime scene.

426
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,759
James Tyler?
DC Glenn Martin, DC Gail McNally.

427
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,090
- Legenda nדo traduzida -

428
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,480
Can we have a quick word?

429
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,090
Is it OK I call you Jimmy?

430
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,380
We just want to
get your side of things.

431
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,369
Get an account
in your own words

432
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:54,520
on what happened the day after
Paul Spector called here to see Liz.

433
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,629
- Have you spoken to Liz?
- We haven't.

434
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,919
Do you know where she is?
Do you?

435
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,770
Honestly, we have no idea.

436
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,939
How did you find out
Paul Spector had been here?

437
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,399
- Did Liz tell you?
- I heard.

438
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,700
From?

439
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,810
Do you know who I am?

440
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,329
Yes, I know who you are.

441
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:18,920
Then you'll know I have friends
that look out for me.

442
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,560
- It's all yours.
- It's good to have met you.

443
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,030
I have a favour to ask.

444
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,809
- Go ahead.
- Well,

445
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:36,520
she's unidentified as yet,
no next of kin to inform.

446
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,320
Perhaps I can use
her for 12 hours.

447
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,930
Explain.

448
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:47,159
- That man's not right!
- Why do you say that?

449
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,419
I have a reputation and the fucking
wherewithal to back it up!

450
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,229
That piece of shit faces up
to me in a fucking bath towel?

451
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,879
Not a flicker of fear.

452
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,599
Maybe you should sit down,
Mr. Tyler?

453
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,059
Maybe you should suck this.

454
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,049
Jimmy, you're on police bail.
Be sensible.

455
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,989
- Fuck you!
- So by your own admission,

456
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,059
you attempted to intimidate
Paul Spector,

457
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,369
threatened him with violence.

458
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:08,309
He came here,
to this house,

459
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,500
when he knew I wasn't here!

460
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:14,170
They went upstairs to look
at my boy's room.

461
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,459
For all I know
he fucked her on my boy's bed.

462
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,389
My understanding is that
the relationship

463
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:22,449
between Paul Spector and your
wife was purely professional.

464
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,679
So you have talked to Liz then?

465
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,159
I need you to take a step back,
sir.

466
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,969
I've lost my boy!
I won't lose my wife, too!

467
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:31,549
Doesn't she have some say in the
matter? She's not a possession!

468
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,699
That's not helpful.
Calm down, Jimmy.

469
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,209
Especially not because of that
Jew boy piece of shit.

470
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:39,099
Using threatening violent words
is an arrestable offence!

471
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,789
Then arrest me! Go on!
Fucking try it!

472
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,859
- Fucking arrest me, then!
- Would you step back, please?

473
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,150
Get your fucking hands of me!
Get off me!

474
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:50,419
Get the fuck out of my house,
huh?

475
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,800
- Go on, go!
- Get out!

476
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,940
Get the fuck out!

477
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,739
- What was that?
- I was backing you up.

478
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,839
No, you were treating me
like a damsel in distress!

479
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,049
I don't need protection,
I can look after myself.

480
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,399
What, with your handbag?

481
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,589
Why don't you come join the rest
of us in the 21st century?

482
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,899
I knuckle in. It's what I do
with any partner.

483
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,390
Yeah?
Well, in future knuckle out.

484
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,390
Fucking peelers!

485
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,009
What is it?
Is it Rose?

486
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,769
- Have you found her?
- No.

487
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,600
But I do need to talk to you.

488
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,009
- How many dolls do you have?
- 20 dolls.

489
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:52,029
20 dolls?
That's a lot.

490
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,929
- Can you show me one?
- Yes.

491
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:56,850
Do you want to go to your room
and get one?

492
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,480
It's easier with Cody.

493
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,790
He's too young to appreciate
how worried I am.

494
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,660
But with Nancy, it's...

495
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,060
She just misses her mother

496
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,770
and I find it really hard
lying to her.

497
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,800
Yes.

498
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,100
I have nothing new to report, Tom.

499
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,570
But we are following some very
promising lines of inquiry.

500
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,799
So if you do see something
on the news

501
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,000
that looks like it could be Rose,

502
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,150
rest assured that it isn't.

503
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,409
- It isn't her.
- OK.

504
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:49,759
It's an attempt to provoke the man

505
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,030
we believe is holding Rose
into action.

506
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,760
When we do find her
you'll be the first to know.

507
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,770
- So you haven't given up hope?
- Good God, no.

508
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,130
Never.

509
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,460
Hey, you two. Look who's here.

510
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,779
Hello, darling.

511
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,500
- Daddy!
- Livvie.

512
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,309
All right, stranger.

513
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:39,180
<i>From Bravo - the target and his
wife entering 217 Leftfield Road.</i>

514
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:41,720
Door closed.

515
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,029
<i>Where are you now, Glenn?</i>

516
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:18,519
<i>I'm with the Covert Operations
Unit, ma'am,</i>

517
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,480
<i>two minutes away
from Spector's house.</i>

518
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,089
He's with his wife and children
in Lisburn.

519
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:25,199
- That's 20 minutes away.
<i>- Right.</i>

520
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,329
We have no idea how long
they are intending to stay.

521
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:31,150
<i>- Understood.</i>
- I'll be with Control.

522
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,449
From One - that's the Technical Unit
arriving at the target's house.

523
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:41,629
<i>Control. From X-Ray One -
that's the technical unit</i>

524
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,280
<i>arriving at target's house.</i>

525
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,980
<i>Control to Bravo,
please update.</i>

526
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,659
<i>From Bravo -
target and family still in situ.</i>

527
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,750
217 <i>Leftfield Road</i>.

528
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,889
<i>Control to Bravo.
Wait out.</i>

529
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,190
<i>Copy.</i>

530
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,190
How're we doing?

531
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,500
Technical unit has entered
target's house.

532
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,850
<i>- How's that, ma'am?</i>
- That works.

533
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:02,100
<i>I'll take a power
feed from the loft.</i>

534
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,559
<i>We can now go live to the scene</i>

535
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,349
to hear from the police
officer in charge.

536
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:12,959
<i>We can confirm that the
body of a white woman,</i>

537
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,269
<i>in her late twenties,
early thirties</i>

538
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:17,929
<i>was found earlier
today by a young couple out walking.</i>

539
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:19,389
<i>I can offer no more information</i>

540
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,249
<i>until the remains
have been identified.</i>

541
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,959
<i>Are you linking this death to the
recent murder?</i>

542
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,669
<i>- How long has she been dead?
- That's all I can say.</i>

543
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,479
<i>- Thank you.
- If it's not Rose Stagg,</i>

544
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,209
<i>why was Superintendent
Gibson here earlier?</i>

545
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:29,619
<i>That's all I can say, thank you.</i>

546
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,509
<i>So, no suggestion that the
police are treating the death</i>

547
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:34,880
<i>as suspicious
despite speculation...</i>

548
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,689
It's the original drawing, ma'am,

549
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:41,689
that we lifted from the
indentations on the Ian Kay letter.

550
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:44,290
We're there on an intelligence
gathering mission.

551
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:48,090
We don't have a warrant to
search for evidence.

552
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,360
Take pictures.

553
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:17,030
Stay still.

554
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,500
What the fuck!

555
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:26,019
We'll go home and get into our
jammies.

556
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,029
- All right, guys.
- See you Steve.

557
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,689
- See ya.
- From Bravo.

558
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:31,169
Target's family on the move.

559
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:34,050
Leaving 217 Leftfield Road.

560
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,570
<i>Control, from Bravo.
Target on the move.</i>

561
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,199
Bravo,
target approaching Volvo.

562
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,470
<i>From Golf. Leaving from rear of
Leftfield Road.</i>

563
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,959
<i>Bravo. Vehicle heading south
on Leftfield Road.</i>

564
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,269
<i>Family on board.</i>

565
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:52,160
<i>From Golf.
I have...</i>

566
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,769
<i>- We have a problem.</i>
- What?

567
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:57,289
<i>We've a collapsed ceiling.</i>

568
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:59,360
- What ceiling?
<i>- Above the main bedroom.</i>

569
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,879
- How bad?
<i>- Destroye</i>d.

570
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,189
Shit!

571
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,959
<i>From Golf.
Target's car joining the A1...</i>

572
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,029
- Is there a water tank in the loft?
<i>- Yes, ma'am.</i>

573
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:11,330
Shit!

574
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,119
Make it look like a flood
and get out.

575
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,729
Looks like the Spectors
are heading home, ma'am.

576
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:19,110
Shit!
Fuck!

577
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,140
<i>What are you up to?</i>

578
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:24,030
Fuck all.

579
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,540
<i>Mr. Big Dick not online?</i>

580
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:30,229
Not yet.
And don't call him that.

581
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,530
<i>Why?</i>

582
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,990
It's not about that.

583
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:37,080
He means everything to me.

584
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:45,040
What is that?

585
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,679
Daddy, what's happening?

586
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,989
Don't touch that.

587
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:51,060
You stay outside, OK?
Don't come in.

588
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,040
<i>Paul?
What is it?</i>

589
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:15,860
<i>What's happened?</i>

590
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,320
Come here, darling.
Liam, come here.

591
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,819
It's the main tank.
It's flooded.

592
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,749
Why? Why would the tank flood?

593
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:42,729
- Must be a faulty stop cock.
- What about all my things?

594
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:44,439
It's mainly our bedroom.

595
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,749
I want to see.

596
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,750
You can't, darling, it's not safe.

597
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:51,169
- What are we going to do?
- You should go to your mum's.

598
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:53,289
I don't want to go to Grandma's!

599
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:55,179
I want to stay with you.

600
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:57,559
I'll get on to the landlord.
We'll get it sorted.

601
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,199
God, Paul...

602
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,310
At least it's not unsanitary water.
I'll sort it, I promise.

603
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:07,720
From X-Ray One, target and wife
and children returning to car.

604
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,279
It's going to be all right.
OK? I promise.

605
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,760
Everything's going to be all right.
I'll see you again really soon.

606
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,520
We'll always be together.

607
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,209
From X-Ray One.
The target is not on board.

608
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:47,339
The target not on board.

609
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:50,379
<i>Control, from X-Ray One.
Target not on board.</i>

610
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:53,279
<i>Repeat,
target not on board.</i>

611
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,940
Target's wife heading
citywards in Volvo.

612
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:00,420
<i>From Control. Target's wife
heading citywards in Volvo.</i>

613
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:03,180
<i>From Golf.
I have.</i>

614
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:05,600
<i>Control, Golf has.</i>

615
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,530
Target returning to house.

616
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,440
<i>Control.
Target returning to house.</i>

617
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,900
Door closed.

618
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:34,729
- Every possible exit is covered?
- Yes, ma'am.

619
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:37,409
<i>From X-Ray One,
target put to bed.</i>

620
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:38,710
Right.

621
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,520
Do you know a detective
called Tom Anderson?

622
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,100
Yeah.

623
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,609
Detective Sergeant West Belfast.

624
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:56,460
Young, charismatic...

625
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,510
Good looking.

626
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,599
I met him at a crime scene.

627
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,390
He was wearing a full forensic mask.

628
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,020
What about him?

629
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,460
Thought he might make a useful
addition to our team?

630
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,480
I'll look into it.

631
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,340
You do that.

632
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,800
Long day?

633
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,580
Do we know anything
more about our Jane Doe?

634
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:31,340
No external signs of a struggle.

635
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,660
You're thinking suicide?

636
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,259
There was some bruises
at the injection sites.

637
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:41,459
I'll do an internal
examination in the morning

638
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,610
when we get the toxicology reports.

639
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,420
God!

640
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,590
Why hang yourself
when an overdose will do?

641
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,740
So we think this is Spector?

642
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:13,020
Seems likely, sir, yes.

643
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,820
What a monumental cock-up.

644
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:25,310
"P.B. Aged ten."

645
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,479
There's no suggestion these children
are at risk from their father?

646
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,409
We checked Social Services
and their school.

647
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:43,900
No cause for concern
as far as anyone is aware.

648
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:49,100
Nothing must happen to those
children,

649
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:51,460
above all else.

650
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,300
Why didn't you call earlier?

651
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:17,950
<i>I've been busy.</i>

652
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,690
<i>How are you?</i>

653
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,220
<i>Where are you? Is that your study?</i>

654
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:29,639
<i>Have you moved back home?</i>

655
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,750
No, I haven't moved back home.

656
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,360
I've really missed you.

657
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,460
<i>Have you?</i>

658
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:46,950
I think about you all the time,
every minute of every day.

659
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:50,850
- Is it painful?
<i>- Yes.</i>

660
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:52,710
Good.

661
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,460
Why good?

662
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:00,160
Because other people's pain,
gives me pleasure.

663
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:04,240
<i>- Even mine?</i>
- Especially yours.

664
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,220
Don't say that.

665
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,410
Right. I'm going to get changed.

666
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,370
You look ready for sleep.

667
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,230
<i>I've got something
I want you to do for me.</i>

668
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:38,230
What?

669
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,740
<i>I need you to go to my hotel room.</i>

670
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,400
I just don't know how to get you in.

671
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,220
- That's easy.
- Is it?

672
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:49,409
I have a key.

673
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:52,850
<i>- How?</i>
- I got one cut.

674
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,210
Why?

675
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:00,210
<i>I don't know,
I just did.</i>

676
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,490
Then maybe you're ready to
take the next step?

677
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,270
More than ready.

678
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,160
I don't mean that.

679
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,780
Then what?

680
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,590
Are you ready to embrace
the darkness?

681
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:25,060
I'd do anything for you.

682
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:27,070
Look.

683
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,460
I've filled it out for all
the murders.

684
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,060
Saying you were with me every time.

685
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:36,299
I've researched it.

686
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,070
It's really believable.

687
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:40,750
There's a lot of sex.

688
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,029
I've told you already,
it's not about sex!

689
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:47,380
It's about deciding on the essential
nature of the world.

690
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:51,029
Is the world a place of pain
and suffering,

691
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:53,020
of grief and despair

692
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:58,470
or is it a place full of joy,
all sweetness and light?

693
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,750
- I don't know I...
<i>- I think you do.</i>

694
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,390
Your father was decapitated
in a motorcycle accident.

695
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:09,459
<i>Or have you forgotten?</i>

696
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:12,169
No, I haven't forgotten.

697
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:13,750
<i>It's OK.</i>

698
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,400
My mother killed herself
when I was seven.

699
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:20,880
Left me alone
and unwanted.

700
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,640
There's suffering all around us.

701
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,600
Why not take some pleasure from it?

702
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,089
I don't know how to get
pleasure from suffering.

703
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:35,390
Yes, you do.

704
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,450
Take your sexy friend, Daisy.

705
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,880
You think she's sexy?

706
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:47,499
<i>How would you feel
if suddenly</i>

707
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,300
<i>she began to fail?</i>

708
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,880
<i>Fail her exams,
fail with boys?</i>

709
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,150
<i>She suddenly lost her good looks?</i>

710
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,259
How?

711
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,000
<i>She got fat.</i>

712
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:07,669
Or a madman threw acid in her face,

713
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:10,120
a random,
motiveless attack.

714
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,350
That would be too much.

715
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:16,210
<i>Would it?</i>

716
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:18,540
Why should she have it all?

717
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:23,450
Why should she be the one that's
clever and sexy and popular?

718
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:27,400
Why should she be the one
with parents who adore her?!

719
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,760
<i>Happiness in others</i>

720
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:36,270
<i>is an affront to our own
pain and misery, Katie.</i>

721
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,010
<i>If other people's
happiness pains us,</i>

722
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:43,200
then why not reduce that happiness?

723
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,539
Nurture your envy, Katie,

724
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:49,670
your anger,
it's the way forward.

725
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,620
What is it you want me to do?

726
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,410
- Gibson?
<i>- It's Tom Anderson, ma'am.</i>

727
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,550
Thank you for making that
statement to the press.

728
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:09,590
<i>Did it help?</i>

729
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,450
I'm not sure yet.

730
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,709
<i>Well, I thought you should know
we've identified the victim</i>

731
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:17,019
<i>from her prints.</i>

732
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:20,049
<i>Marina McPherson.
A string of drug convictions.</i>

733
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:22,800
<i>There's a strong indication
she took her own life.</i>

734
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:27,009
<i>Her phone records show
a number of phone calls</i>

735
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:30,199
<i>to a suicide helpline over the last
six months or so.</i>

736
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,719
Anything else?

737
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,089
<i>Yeah,
there's a letter to her mother,</i>

738
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:37,020
<i>- more or less a suicide note.</i>
- What did she say?

739
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,010
<i>"I know you were home, Mum.</i>

740
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:42,370
<i>"You must have heard me
calling you.</i>

741
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:44,790
<i>"Why didn't you answer the door?</i>

742
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:48,320
<i>"I know I've been bad,
but I'm still your daughter.</i>

743
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:51,060
<i>"If you'd answered the door to me,
who knows,</i>

744
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,000
<i>"but now it's too late."</i>

745
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,670
"Can't find my place in life.

746
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,460
"It's killing me inside."

747
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,060
You there, ma'am?

748
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,650
<i>Yes, I'm here.</i>

749
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,490
Keep me posted.

750
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,040
Good night.

751
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,860
What on Earth are you doing?

752
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,700
Wondering where Rose is.

753

<i>You snap the band on your wrist</i>

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,009
<i>when your thoughts and
feelings overwhelm you.</i>

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:09,219
I'm sorry, I want to remember,
I really do.

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,699
- I know everything!
- What are you talking about?

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,379
Paul confessed, Katie. There's
no need to cover for him.

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,939
<i>You need to get your
stories straight.</i>

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,969
<i>According to her,
there's been no affair, just,</i>

8
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,749
<i>just some kind of sexual assault.</i>

9
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,929
Jesus, Paul, what did you do to her?

10
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,599
When I met Peter,
I already had a boyfriend.

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,579
That boyfriend was Tom,
who became my husband.

12
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,899
<i>- And you never told him what happened?
- No.</i>

13
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,449
Who are you?

14
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,249
Excuse me, ma'am. The divers
might have found something.

15
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,680
<i>- Where's Mummy sleeping?</i>
- In there.

16
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,729
In his own mind,

17
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,639
he believes he has the right

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,859
to decide who lives
and who dies.

19
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,160
Peter?

Help me.
I don't want to die.

The Fall
Season 2 - Episode 02

25
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,980
Stop shaking.

26

"One Named Peter"

27
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,550
Start again, steady hand.

28
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,160
- Is this your phone?
- Yeah.

29
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,730
The child locks are on.

30
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,280
I don't understand what's happening.

31
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,390
- What are you doing?
- Stay still.

32
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,400
Where are you taking me?

33
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,740
Are my babies all right?

34
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,840
Yes.

35
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,280
And Tom?

36
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,760
You mean the drunk sleeping on the sofa?

37
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,740
He's dead to the world.

38
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,930
Why are you doing this to me?

39
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,810
What is this?

40
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,540
You went to the police, Rose.

41
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,860
I didn't.

42
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,230
You sat with a police
officer, probably for hours,

43
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,270
and put together
that likeness of me.

44
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,350
This doesn't even look like you.

45
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,790
You've made my life very difficult.

46
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,940
But...

47
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,350
you're not...
him.

48
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,600
Are you?

49
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,840
No.

50
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,850
I'm not him.

51
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,779
Well, then you have nothing to fear.

52
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,090
Please take me home.
Please!

53
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,470
It wasn't me!

54
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,990
Perhaps it was that other girl,
the one who survived?

55
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,110
The caption said it was
nine years ago. It was you.

56
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,720
No, it wasn't me.

57
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,499
The thought that you could be him,

58
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,510
that you could be the man.

59
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,990
It never crossed my mind.

60
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,100
Have you forgotten what
happened between us?

61
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,320
No.

62
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,070
No, I hadn't forgotten.

63
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,850
But that doesn't mean...

64
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,480
We were just trying things...

65
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,670
doing things.

66
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,250
It was just something that happened.

67
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,110
Too much to drink.

68
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,050
It was a lifetime ago.

69
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,770
I'm married.
I'm a mother now.

70
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,099
Maybe it was some other girl, some
other girl that you were seeing!

71
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,699
- Legenda n×“o traduzida -

72
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,220
There was no other girl.

73
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,780
You were the only girl.

74
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,690
And you've betrayed me.

75
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,420
No! No!

76
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,810
No! No!

77
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,100
No!

78
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,260
Nancy!

79
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,460
- Time for breakfast.
<i>- I'm coming, Daddy.</i>

80
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,880
Nancy!

81
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,189
What are they doing?

82
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,280
Looking for him, stupid.

83
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,139
What?!

84
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,179
They must think he lives round here.

85
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,230
My God.
Seriously?

86
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,860
That's the last time I'm
sleeping over at yours.

87
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:27,480
Right-handed professional
decorating shears.

88
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,730
29 centimetre overall length.

89
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:37,019
17.5 centimetre cutting blade...
just under seven inches.

90
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,859
How long were they in the water?

91
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,550
I'm assuming since the night of the 20th.

92
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,809
We can examine them for
trace and contact evidence...

93
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:49,089
blood, fingerprints, fibres...

94
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,539
but it will be degraded after
that amount of time underwater.

95
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,550
They were quite deep in the silt.

96
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,729
Start with the fingerprints

97
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,650
and then see if anything
else can be gleaned.

98
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,000
We need to fast-track them.

99
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,499
Where did you put Rose?

100
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,140
She's not here yet, ma'am.

101
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,379
I have her mobile number.

102
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,930
Will
you call her place of work?

103
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,859
<i>You have one new message.</i>

104
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,869
<i>Rose, this is Detective
Superintendent Gibson.</i>

105
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,649
<i>We were due to meet today.</i>

106
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,109
<i>Please ring and let me
know when you'll be here.</i>

107
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,499
<i>I do have further questions for you.</i>

108
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,590
<i>It's essential that you come
in today. Please call me.</i>

109
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,379
Her first appointment at work
was at eight this morning.

110
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,259
She didn't turn up and
no word from her either.

111
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,219
Several patients have not received
their radiology treatments.

112
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,689
Her department at the hospital
have been trying to reach her.

113
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,250
This has never happened
before. No reply from home.

114
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,750
See if the hospital human resources
has a next-of-kin number for Rose.

115
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,139
<i>When was the last
time that you saw her?</i>

116
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,260
She left in the early
hours of the morning.

117
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,350
<i>What time?</i>

118
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,420
I'm not sure.
I was sleeping.

119
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,779
So how do you know?

120
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,330
<i>She left me a note.</i>

121
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,339
Do you still have that note?

122
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,640
Yeah.

123
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,900
<i>Please keep it safe.</i>

124
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,550
Why?
What's this about?

125
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,690
<i>Where are you, Tom?</i>

126
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,450
I'm in the park.

127
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,310
<i>Go home. Meet me there.
I'm on my way.</i>

128
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,699
Are you aware that Rose
was due to see me today?

129
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,180
Yes.
I am.

130
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,910
And do you know why?

131
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,640
I think so.

132
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,999
How does she normally get to work?

133
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,300
She drives.

134
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,050
- And her car is gone?
- Yes.

135
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,860
Anything strike you as
unusual this morning, Tom?

136
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,119
Er, maybe, one thing.
I'm sure it's nothing.

137
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,929
- Go on.
- Her bite guard

138
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,859
was over there, on the side.

139
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,029
- Her...?
- Bite guard.

140
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,679
She wears it at night
to stop her from grinding her teeth.

141
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,559
Normally, when she wakes,
she puts it in its wee box

142
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,990
at the side of bed and...

143
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,300
at night, she rinses
it and puts it back in.

144
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,019
And this is her handwriting?

145
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,459
- Yes.
- Her normal hand?

146
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,540
Yes.
Should I be worried?

147
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,990
Why are you here?

148
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,400
Just to look after you while
your daddy answers some questions.

149
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,230
Look what I found.

150
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,250
It's sad, isn't it?

151
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,840
It's very sad.

152
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,610
You weren't aware
of her getting out of bed?

153
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,390
I wasn't in bed with her.

154
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,950
Where were you?

155
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,450
I slept on the sofa.

156
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,600
Why?

157
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,860
We'd argued.

158
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,080
What about?

159
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,019
She told me she was coming in to see you,

160
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,019
that she had already
spoken to you once before,

161
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,830
and she told me why.

162
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:08,300
And what she told me explained
something that has always...

163
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,619
That I'd never understood before.

164
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,190
What was that?

165
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,539
A period at university when, suddenly,

166
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,239
she wouldn't talk to me,

167
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,010
see me at all, for three months.

168
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,449
Then, one day, she called.

169
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,699
We started seeing
each other again.

170
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,840
And we got married soon after.

171
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,290
How did you feel...

172
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,910
... when she told you
why she'd withdrawn?

173
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,500
Upset.

174
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,779
Angry.

175
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,349
Violently angry?

176
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,350
No.
No, never.

177
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,219
Angry enough to make her leave you?

178
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,520
No.

179
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,010
I don't,
I don't think so.

180
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,499
- Can I help you?
- I'm Paul Spector.

181
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,660
Yes, I've been
expecting you. Take a seat.

182
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,510
This is the case file you need.

183
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,670
<i>We're going to need a number
of recent photographs of Rose.</i>

184
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,800
There's quite a lot
to choose from.

185
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,390
When was that taken?

186
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,530
That was last year.

187
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,290
That was just last week.

188
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,640
Come in.

189
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,949
Assistant Chief Constable
Burns is here, ma'am.

190
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,250
Right.

191
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,550
Stay here, Tom.

192
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,450
I'll be back.

193
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,350
Contact Control by radio.
This is Rose Stagg's car.

194
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,650
Circulate the details.

195
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,849
We need to get the
family out of there, Jim.

196
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,580
Conduct an initial
visual search.

197
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,999
Open all doors,
access all rooms,

198
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,419
cupboards,
voids.

199
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,709
She might still be in there somewhere.

200
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,100
Stella, you shouldn't be here.

201
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,159
This isn't a voluntary
missing person.

202
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,950
- How do you know?
- It's an abduction.

203
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,390
The house is a crime scene.

204
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,979
BOTH: If Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers,

205
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,750
where's the peck of pickled
peppers Peter Piper picked?

206
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,489
That's the best so far.

207
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,019
Did you learn that at school?

208
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,720
- No, from Peter Piper.
- Really?

209
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,139
Mummy's friend.

210
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,179
Your mummy has a friend called Peter Piper?

211
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,570
Yes. He was here last night.

212
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,909
We made a decision

213
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,479
to say that the likeness
was from nine years ago,

214
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,819
and I think we have led
him straight to Rose.

215
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,120
How?

216
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,219
And I called him Peter, too.

217
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,980
A common enough name.

218
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,509
Why would we be interested

219
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,259
in a likeness
from nine years ago?

220
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,319
Because of a precursor crime.

221
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,939
Something that happened in
the past that seems to presage

222
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,529
the current crimes.
Like a woman being strangled

223
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,850
into unconsciousness
by her boyfriend.

224
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,339
I mean, maybe he did that
with every woman that he met.

225
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,459
But what if he only did it once?

226
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:03,129
How difficult would that
be for him to work out?

227
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,369
Rose never reported it.

228
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:08,539
The boyfriend was never
interviewed, charged.

229
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,989
As far as he knows, it's always
remained a private matter.

230
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,499
Until now.

231
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,860
We have made it public.

232
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,659
We should've age-enhanced the
picture and used that instead.

233
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,980
- There's been a development, ma'am.
- Get in.

234
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,669
- It's from the daughter, from Nancy.
- Go on.

235
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,929
It seems there was someone
in the house last night.

236
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:38,339
Someone who said he was
a friend of her mother's.

237
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,979
Nancy watched them going off,
crossing the street together.

238
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,250
Someone who said he was called Peter.

239
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,160
Can I help you?

240
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,900
I'm here to see a patient, Annie Brawley.

241
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,359
Why is he here?

242
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,240
I'm giving the case to Eastwood.

243
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,859
When did you decide that?

244
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,719
If the Task Force
investigates this,

245
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,479
the media will be all over it.
We don't need that extra pressure.

246
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,039
I'm sorry, that's ridiculous.

247
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,219
She's been missing for less than 12 hours.

248
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,069
It's important we appear
not to be overreacting.

249
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,509
- Jim!
- You can't

250
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,869
see past the killer.

251
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,899
I want all lines of
inquiry looked at...

252
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,109
marital, extra-marital,
depression, suicide.

253
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:03,069
The child said that there was a
stranger in the house last night,

254
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,949
a stranger who called himself Peter.

255
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,380
Rose's life is at risk and it's my fault!

256
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,550
I will ask Eastwood to keep
you briefed on any developments.

257
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,819
- Gibson.
<i>- Ma'am, it's Larkin.</i>

258
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,529
<i>We've found a receipt for the
shears amongst Annie's papers.</i>

259
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,479
<i>I've obtained a duplicate set.</i>

260
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,380
I'll meet you at the mortuary.

261
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,259
I've read the case notes
and I know the background.

262
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,950
And, in truth, a female therapist
would've been a better option.

263
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,779
I don't believe one was available

264
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,710
and, honestly, there's no-one
better qualified than me.

265
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,659
Now, it's possible that your
daughter may react unfavourably

266
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,019
to my presence.

267
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,800
A male of a certain age...

268
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,779
It could trigger an emotional reaction.

269
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,620
So if you would stay close
by, at first at least.

270
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,280
Annie?

271
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,339
Yes?

272
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,980
I'm Paul Spector.

273
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,140
Can I come in?

274
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,680
Course.

275
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,920
I'll be a minute.

276
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,750
<i>I feel so guilty.</i>

277
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,190
Tell me why.

278
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,240
It's not just guilt.

279
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,800
It's shame.

280
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,250
What have you got to be ashamed of?

281
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,620
I subscribed to a website.

282
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,610
I created a profile.

283
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,570
What sort of website?

284
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,180
An adult website.

285
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,200
I just keep thinking,
you know...

286
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,480
... what if he saw me on there?
What if...

287
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,640
And what if he chose
me because of that site?

288
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,050
Did you post pictures of yourself?

289
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,120
A couple.

290
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,680
But nothing very revealing.

291
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,880
OK.

292
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,880
But also...

293
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,600
... a video.

294
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,420
What kind of video?

295
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,520
Suggesting...

296
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:02,120
... suggesting that I
might be up for bondage.

297
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,360
Domination, that type of thing.

298
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,659
I said I had a high...

299
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,819
high threshold for pain.

300
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,800
I actually said that,
but...

301
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,130
I didn't know.
It was just...

302
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:24,950
It was just...
a fantasy, a... a game.

303
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,350
There's a world of difference,
Annie,

304
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,450
between what consenting adults
choose to do in their bedroom

305
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:38,170
and the violent sexual
assault that you suffered.

306
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,530
Nothing you did, frankly,
nothing you could ever do,

307
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:46,290
would ever make you responsible
for the events of that night.

308
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,890
That's down to him...

309
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,200
... and him alone.

310
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,179
When did you last see Rose?

311
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,549
I bumped into her at the
market on Sunday.

312
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,160
We had coffee.

313
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,700
Is it out of character...

314
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,440
... for her to take off?

315
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:17,630
You think that's what
happened? She just took off?

316
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,540
Possible.

317
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,180
It's also possible that
this could all be our fault.

318
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,350
Why do you say that?

319
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,569
Hasn't it occurred to you
that she might have been taken,

320
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,870
by him?

321
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,299
Why would he do that?

322
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,460
I don't know...
to silence her?

323
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,439
What if we've exposed her to
danger from that man

324
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,700
by getting her to talk to you
about the past?

325
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,920
<i>Are you keeping a journal?</i>

326
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,440
It's my diary from before.

327
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,339
The idea is it's supposed to help me

328
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,780
remember more about what happened to me.

329
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,200
And has it helped?

330
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,140
I've not read it yet.

331
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,220
Well, maybe it will help.

332
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,460
Or maybe it won't.

333
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,220
We all know people who
live too much in the past.

334
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,249
Too much history,
too much remembering,

335
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,370
can ultimately destroy the present...

336
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,440
... and the future.

337
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,740
Thanks.

338
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,580
It's been really useful.

339
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,500
Good.

340
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,939
It's getting too long.

341
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,240
It's annoying me.

342
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,110
Use that hairband
to put it back.

343
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,780
This is for something else.

344
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,390
A friend gave it to me.

345
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,760
A friend?

346
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,880
Yeah.

347
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,050
I can arrange for a hairdresser
to visit if you like?

348
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,910
- Really?
- Of course.

349
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,020
Well, then...

350
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,130
... yes, please.

351
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,430
I'll see you the day after tomorrow.

352
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,899
<i>You have one new message.</i>

353
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,299
<i>I'm at the school gates
to pick up Liam and Olivia,</i>

354
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,750
<i>but Olivia isn't here.</i>

355
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,240
<i>Why is your phone always...</i>

356
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,339
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Sally, it's me. What's going on?

357
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,839
<i>I'm calling the police.</i>

358
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,919
- Why?
<i>- Olivia's been taken.</i>

359
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,229
What do you mean "taken"?

360
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:17,019
<i>Your fucking little
tramp of a girlfriend.</i>

361
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,759
- What?
<i>- Katie.</i>

362
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,329
<i>She told Miss Selmer that I
asked her to pick up Livvy.</i>

363
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,979
<i>Pick up Livvy and leave
Liam to wait for me?!</i>

364
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,130
<i>- I'm calling the police.</i>
- Don't do that.

365
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,850
I'll deal with it.

366
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,699
<i>How the hell can you do that?
You're in Scotland.</i>

367
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,629
Actually I'm not. I'm here, I'm in Belfast.

368
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:36,090
<i>What?
When did that happen?</i>

369
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,320
Now. Today.
I'm back.

370
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,899
I've got her number.

371
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:47,080
<i>- I bet you have.</i>
- I'll call her. Just wait.

372
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,199
These are the same size,
make and brand

373
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,350
as the pair that we pulled from the water.

374
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,139
The direction of force

375
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,700
is more or less at a
perpendicular angle to the skin.

376
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,000
And here...

377
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,579
we have abrasions that look
like they've been caused

378
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,159
by the handle of the weapon...

379
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,879
a kind of hilt-mark injury.

380
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,279
You said that the maximal depth
of the wounds was nine inches,

381
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,889
but these scissors have blades
that are under seven inches.

382
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:44,010
Yeah, because of the compression
of the body with force,

383
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,189
the depth measurement

384
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,600
can be greater than the
length of the blade.

385
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,420
There's nothing to indicate that
these aren't the murder weapon.

386
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,569
<i>Have you found them?</i>

387
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:10,879
Not yet.

388
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,189
<i>Paul...</i>

389
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:15,550
Wait just a little longer.
I'll call you as soon as I do.

390
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,900
<i>You have a funny name.</i>

391
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,939
Katrina?

392
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,010
No. Like my name is Spector.

393
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,200
Benedetto.

394
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,200
It's Italian.

395
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,650
Did you get teased at school?

396
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,560
A bit.

397
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,649
Is this it?

398
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:57,370
- Is this really your favourite place?
- Yeah.

399
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,459
Do you remember that necklace you had?

400
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,400
- The one with the beetle on it?
- Daddy gave it to me.

401
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,959
Where did he get it?

402
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,440
I don't know. It was a present
for trying hard at school.

403
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,590
Do you still have it?

404
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,339
- I lost it.
- How?

405
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:40,430
- It disappeared.
- When?

406
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,080
I don't know.

407
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,340
Daddy!

408
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,520
Hey.

409
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,950
- When did you get back?
- Today.

410
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,340
It's getting late.
We need to get you home.

411
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,620
Wait for me there.

412
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,300
- Say goodbye to Katie.
- Bye, Katie.

413
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,360
Hello.

414
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,859
Straight upstairs, please.

415
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,799
I want to be with Daddy.

416
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,379
It's late. Upstairs and
into your pyjamas now.

417
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,950
- I'm hungry.
- Upstairs.

418
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,379
Where were they?

419
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,680
In the park.

420
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,740
When did you get back?

421
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,999
Just this afternoon.

422
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,819
What is wrong with that girl?

423
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,539
Why does she want to hurt me?

424
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,139
It's not you she wants to hurt, it's me.

425
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,599
Daddy!
Are you coming?

426
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,450
The things she said to you,
they're...

427
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,870
they're teenage fantasies.

428
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:45,190
There was no attack,
no near-rape or whatever.

429
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,429
Olivia saw you.

430
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,719
She got out of bed
and she saw you.

431
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,339
What did she see?

432
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,280
You and Katie on the floor.

433
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,009
That was probably
one of her dreams.

434
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:58,310
Jesus!

435
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,779
We can ask her about it
together, now or in the morning.

436
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,380
- Talk to her about it.
- Ask her?

437
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,879
You have no idea, do you? Ask her?

438
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,389
- Sally...
- Anyway,

439
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,459
you won't be here in the morning.

440
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:14,050
I want you gone and out of this house now.

441
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,600
And what will I say to Olivia?

442
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,790
You'll think of something.

443
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:39,499
- Did you have fun with Katie?
- It was OK.

444
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,450
- What did you talk about?
- School and stuff.

445
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:45,079
She likes to ask a lot of
questions, doesn't she?

446
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,380
Quite a lot.

447
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,539
- What did she ask you?
- About Scotland.

448
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,299
What else?

449
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,230
My necklace, the one that got lost.

450
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:11,139
- I have to go, darling.
- Why?

451
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,959
I have things to do.

452
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,020
When will I see you again?

453
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,080
# The stars in your eyes
burn and shine

454
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,250
# The curve of your lips
as they meet mine

455
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:09,510
# Break every rule for you

456
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,300
# And I'd dance to the Blues

457
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:13,680
# Like a crazy fool.

458
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,480
# If you were mine
If you were mine...#

459
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,810
Sally.

460
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:23,180
# If you were mine.#

461
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,800
I don't think I can have this baby.

462
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,099
What?

463
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,730
How can I?

464
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,860
Don't sit down.

465
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,170
What do you mean you can't have the baby?

466
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,539
What do you think I mean?

467
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,539
Sally, you can't do that.

468
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,939
Why not?

469
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,689
You're a neo-natal nurse.

470
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,389
We're not Catholic.

471
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,150
My mother was Catholic.

472
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:04,360
What, the woman that killed
herself? Abandoned you?

473
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,880
The police were here earlier.

474
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,579
What do you mean?

475
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,263
Knocking on all the doors,

476
00:41:18,264 --> 00:41:20,300
talking to all the men
in the neighbourhood.

477
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,180
What did you say?

478
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,980
I told them you were in Scotland.

479
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,120
Is that all?

480
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:34,090
I wanted to tell them
that I'd lied for you.

481
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,020
But you didn't?

482
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,850
I tried.

483
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,459
I tried really hard in Scotland.

484
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,019
I know.

485
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,719
You were cold, distant.

486
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,059
I was ill.

487
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,159
I had food
poisoning or something.

488
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,400
You made no effort, Paul.

489
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,550
You held me down on the floor.

490
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,540
"If you were mine".

491
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:56,819
<i>This morning, a spokesperson
from the City Hospital said</i>

492
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,989
<i>Mr. Monroe,
who is in intensive care,</i>

493
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,699
<i>remains in critical condition.</i>

494
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,719
<i>The hunt for the Belfast Strangler,</i>

495
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,939
<i>one of whose victims was the
daughter-in-law of Morgan Monroe</i>

496
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,340
<i>continues.</i>

497
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,089
"Mi ritrovai
per una selva oscura,

498
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:30,269
"Che la diritta via
era smarrita.

499
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:33,299

00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,719
"Esta selva selvaggia

501
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,430
"Che nel pensier
rinova la paura!"

502
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,800
Do you read this in
Italian or the translation?

503
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,039
"Midway upon the journey
of our life,

504
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,989
"I found myself
within a forest dark,

505
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:53,160
"For the straightforward
pathway had been lost and... "

506
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,799
I warned you once before
about fucking up my family.

507
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,399
This is your last warning.

508
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,819
Why?

509
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:03,720
What are you going to do to me?

510
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,490
Good. Do it!

511
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:13,960
Good.

512
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,440
Kill me.

513
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:35,109
This is all bullshit.

514
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:37,419
You don't think I'm a killer
at all or you wouldn't be here.

515
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,739
Fuck!
You hurt me!

516
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:40,709
That's nothing compared
to what I'll do to you

517
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,360
if you don't stop playing your games.

518
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,659
I'm not playing games.

519
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:47,289
Dancing in front of me,
writing songs about me,

520
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:48,699
stripping on the stairs.

521
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,950
You're playing games.
Stupid, childish games.

522
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,419
Don't call me a child again.

523
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,099
You're 15 years old.

524
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,129
- I'm 16 now.
- Still a child.

525
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:00,550
I'm not a child!

526
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,460
Don't shout.

527
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,490
You're a liar!

528
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,859
You told me you couldn't
trust yourself around me.

529
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,830
You said I was beautiful.

530
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,580
I was fucking with your head!

531
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,300
You pig.
I fucking hate you.

532
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:21,550
Then stay out of my life.

533
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,600
How can I with all that I know about you?

534
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,869
You know nothing about me.

535
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:28,329
You're a suburban schoolgirl

536
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:31,259
with a load of sensational
fantasies running around her head.

537
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:32,950
I'm much more than that.

538
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:35,520
No.

539
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:39,830
You're a little virgin
dreaming of her first fuck.

540
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:42,880
OK.

541
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,380
If that's what you want.

542
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,040
What are you doing?

543
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:41,220
Paul?

544
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:06,620
Get off!

545
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,640
What are you doing?

546
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,470
Consider it a test.

547
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,520
What?

548
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:10,990
Your bonds aren't tight
and your wrists are small.

549
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:14,000
You should be able to
get out easily enough.

550
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,870
While you struggle...

551
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,500
... why don't you have a think
about what you want to do next.

552
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,420
As Camus says,

553
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,810
"Life is the sum of all
your choices."

554
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,490
Choose your next move carefully, Katie.

555
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,609
Gibson.

556
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:39,629
<i>- It's Larkin, ma'am.</i>
- Yes?

557
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:42,629
<i>We've heard from the
Recording Officer at the labs.</i>

558
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:45,609
<i>They've managed to lift a
partial print from the scissors.</i>

559
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:47,819
<i>We've run it through the
system and found a match.</i>

560
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,180
Hang on.

561
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:00,190
- Go ahead.
<i>- Paul Spector.</i>

562
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,569
How are you spelling that surname?

563
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:09,200
<i>S-P-E-C-T-O-R.</i>

564
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,280
Spector.

565
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:29,869
Paul Spector.

566
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:31,729
Apparently,
we talked to him in connection

567
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:33,319
with the Sarah Kay murder.

568
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,620
Yeah.

569
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:42,299
Identified himself in the CCTV
footage in the Botanic Gardens.

570
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,860
Came in voluntarily.

571
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,349
I want every detail
on that interview.

572
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,079
- Was it taped?
- Yes, ma'am.

573
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,130
Find the audio tapes. I want to hear them.

574
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:18,450
Where were you last night,
Mr. Spector?

575
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:22,969
<i>Last night? Why? What
happened last night?</i>

576
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:24,760
<i>Just answer the question.</i>

577
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:29,889
<i>My wife was working
at the Neo-natal Unit.</i>

578
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:31,190
<i>And you?</i>

579
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,809
<i>I was with the children.</i>

580
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:35,460
<i>All evening and all night?</i>

581
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:40,539
<i>Fed them, bathed them,
put them to bed.</i>

582
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:42,320
<i>I had an early night myself.</i>

583
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:46,340
I know this face.

584
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,600
I've seen him.

585
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:53,120
Here.

586
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,679
I was waiting... for the Kays.

587
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,430
We were going to a press conference and...

588
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:05,420
... he was walking down the corridor
on his own, straight towards me.

589
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:10,390
How can that be?

590
00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:00,379
Spector was asked to account
for his whereabouts

591
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:02,639
on the nights that
the attacks took place

592
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,110
but not on any other nights

593
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:06,619
to see whether his
recall was as good.

594
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:08,339
He came in voluntarily.

595
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:09,819
Why would he do that
if he's the killer?

596
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:11,229
For the thrill?

597
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:13,549
To parade himself
under our noses?

598
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:15,499
To make us look stupid?

599
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,899
To demonstrate his superiority
and utter contempt for us?

600
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,700
Do I have to go on?

601
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,390
Did you interview his wife?

602
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:29,480
Did you check those alibis face-to-face?

603
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,440
No, ma'am.
On the phone.

604
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:38,859
He seemed like a good guy...
bright, likeable, helpful.

605
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:41,220
He let us take his prints, his DNA.

606
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:44,459
It didn't seem as though
he had anything to hide.

607
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:47,549
A married man, a father of
two, a bereavement counsellor...

608
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:52,200
Jesus, Glen.
What have I been saying about
such individuals since day one?

609
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:56,229
They frequently
appear to be charming,

610
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:58,659
intelligent, charismatic.

611
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:00,779
The key word is "appear".

612
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,610
They have to be probed,
wrong-footed, challenged.

613
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,909
And why has nobody followed up

614
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:08,819
with the list of children's
homes that he gave?!

615
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,260
I need a word.

616
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:13,280
In private.

617
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:14,199
As SIO, you have to sign off
every action. You know that.

618
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,839
Now, if you weren't happy,

619
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,489
you should have raised
another action

620
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:19,760
to have further inquiries made.

621
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:24,950
Call Morning Prayers for 7am.

622
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:28,150
I will need to brief the Chief at nine.

623
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,049
Ma'am.
Excuse me.

624
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:36,299
There's been a call
on your old private number.

625
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,959
It rang twice, then rang off.

626
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,360
The call was made from
Rose Stagg's mobile phone.

627
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:11,880
Well?

628
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,699
It was amazing.

629
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,210
Tell me everything.

630
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,440
It's Rose Stagg's number, ma'am.

631
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:03,440
Gibson.

632
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:05,920
<i>Stella?</i>

633
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,240
Yes.

634
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:13,710
<i>How nice to hear
your voice again.</i>

635
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,580
Is that you, Peter?

636
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,480
Yes.

637
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,260
<i>Why are you calling me?</i>

638
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:26,120
Because I'm looking up at the sky.

639
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:30,340
Stella, shining star.

640
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:35,680
It's a beautiful night...
made me think of you.

641
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:40,950
<i>What have you done with Rose?</i>

642
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:43,699
Who?

643
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,170
Rose Stagg.

644
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:47,980
Rose McGill.

645
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,469
You must want me to
know that you have her,

646
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:56,770
or why would you
be using her phone?

647
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:03,800
You wrote that you feel
protective towards children.

648
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:07,659
Rose has two.

649
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:10,700
<i>A boy of 15 months
and a girl of six.</i>

650

1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,229
<i>I've been brought in from
the Metropolitan Police</i>

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,339
<i>to lead a review into
the investigation</i>

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,109
<i>of the murder of Alice Monroe.</i>

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,989
<i>He had things entirely under his
control, which leads me to think</i>

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,199
<i>that this was not his first murder.</i>

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,609
Go back to your review, Stella.

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,219
I don't want
the two murders linked.

8
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,449
<i>Failure to see
that crimes are linked</i>

9
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,210
is the thing that will allow
the killer to strike again.

10
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,009
Do you think her
hairs been clipped?

11
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,149
- Where?
- There.

12
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,559
<i>This is the third murder
in three months, Jim.</i>

13
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,829
<i>If we don't stop him,
he will kill again.</i>

14
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,580
Excuse me, is this your purse?

15
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,729
Thank you so much.

16
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,030
There's been a shooting.

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,999
<i>The detective we saw
near the Falls Road</i>

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,309
<i>on Sunday night.</i>

19
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,609
<i>James Olson is a married man,
Stella.</i>

20
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,149
You were a married man

21
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,159
when you spent
a night in my bed.

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,919
<i>He clearly has a victim type.</i>

23
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,079
They are not victims of chance,
they are victims of choice.

24
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,649
<i>It's possible that
he's out there</i>

25
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,600
stalking his next victim now.

26
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,689
There's someone to see you,
ma'am.

27
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,139
<i>Rose Stagg,
a friend of Professor Reed Smith.</i>

28
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,469
I've spent years interviewing
the victims of rape.

29
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,479
<i>I don't think anyone
ever felt worse</i>

30
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,510
<i>after talking to me
about their experiences.</i>

31
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,809
I have something terrible
to confess.

32
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,539
<i>I've been having an affair.</i>

33
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,599
I called you to say it's over.

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,999
It won't be over until I stop you.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,539
<i>You had your chance.</i>

36
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,510
Now it's too late.

37
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,900
We have an E-FIT from Rose Stagg.

38
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,669
Could he really look like that?

39
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,060
Ma'am, Annie Brawley
has regained consciousness.

40
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,420
All right, let's try
something different.

41
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,210
If you were on the other side
of your bedroom...

42
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,750
.. standing by the window...

43
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,890
.. what would you have seen?

44
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,280
Me on the bed.

45
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,580
Him behind me.

46
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,160
I was on my side at first.

47
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,340
Tied up.

48
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,580
What else?

49
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,060
Can you see him clearly?

50
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,479
- No.
- That's OK.

51
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,650
Let's...
take a step back.

52
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,870
Earlier that night
you had dinner with your brother.

53
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,400
Do you remember what Joe had to eat?

54
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,390
Do you remember what you ordered?

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,074

Once upon a time...
this worked for me.

58
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,980
You snap the band on your wrist...

<i>- Is that mine?
- Yes.</i>

63
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,790
It's been brushed for prints.

64
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,490
They only found yours.

65
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,029
You'll see...

66
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,650
some of the pages
are dusty.

67
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,380
Some people find writing useful.

68
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,230
Putting down thoughts -
whatever they may be.

69
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,220
Reading the entries you made
might help.

70
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,640
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,500
I want to remember, I really do.

72
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,480
I know.

73
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,640
<i>My diary was in a drawer
in my bedroom.</i>

74
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,860
<i>Yes.</i>

75
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,660
<i>He was waiting for me
in my bedroom.</i>

76
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,350
If he was wearing gloves,

77
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,410
he could have read it
and not left any prints.

78
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,540
Yes.

79
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,960
Do you think that he read it?

80
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,860
Yes.

81
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,639
You know, it's hard for everyone.

82
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,520
Because...
I look the same.

83
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,490
The same as I did before.

84
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,310
But I'm not the same.

85
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,700
Hello?

86
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,980
Hang on.
Hang on, I've got a bad signal.

87
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,719
- Hello?
<i>- Daddy?</i>

88
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,020
Livvy?

89
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,020
<i>- Daddy.</i>
- Can you hear me?

90
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,930
<i>Yes.</i>

91
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,839
- Are you OK?
<i>- Yes.</i>

92
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,899
It's the middle of the night.
Why aren't you asleep?

93
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,199
<i>I can't sleep.</i>

94
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,559
- Why, darlin'?
<i>- I'm really worried, Daddy.</i>

95
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,399
- What about?
<i>- My dollies.</i>

96
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,019
<i>I left them behind.
All of them.</i>

97
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,560
<i>When Mummy, me and Liam left
for Scotland.</i>

98
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,500
- What did you leave behind?
<i>- All of my dollies.</i>

99
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,119
Where did you leave them?

100
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,129
<i>In the bath, I think.</i>

101
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,200
<i>- Haven't you seen them?</i>
- No.

102
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,750
<i>Haven't you had a bath
in all that time?</i>

103
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,430
- It hasn't been that long.
<i>- Nearly a whole week.</i>

104
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,570
We have a shower downstairs.

105
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,979
<i>The thing is I really need them.</i>

106
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,420
<i>Can you bring them
when you come home?</i>

107
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,440
I'm not sure when that's
going to be, darlin'.

108
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,199
<i>Why?</i>

109
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,540
It was Mummy decided
to go home... not me.

110
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,590
<i>I need them, Daddy,
I really do.</i>

111
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,990
<i>Please, Daddy,
please.</i>

112
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,780
Jesus!

113
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,529
Don't you announce yourself?

114
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,740
I thought that I was expected.

115
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,600
I wasn't sure you'd come.

116
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,960
Nice shoes.

117
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,180
Is that why I'm here -
to amuse you?

118
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,079
I always thought of him
as stalking victims,

119
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,880
calculating the risks,
planning it all out.

120
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,980
Very controlled, calm,
cold-blooded.

121
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,350
The killing of Joe was different.
It was impulsive, bloody.

122
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,470
Hot-blooded.

123
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,879
If we didn't know it then,
we certainly know it now that he's...

124
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,449
driven by
huge amounts of rage.

125
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,009
So,
we have a eyewitness

126
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,519
who can't quite bring herself
to recall the face,

127
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,259
masked or unmasked,
of the man who did all this?

128
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,519
It's a question of unlocking her.

129
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,780
She's traumatised,
grief-stricken.

130
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,199
She just needs more time.

131
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,119
- And more professional help.
- It's been ten days, Stella.

132
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,039
We're running out of time.

133
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,520
And money.

134
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,069
I...

135
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,090
had this drawn up for
the policing executive tomorrow.

136
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,679
Emergency funding,

137
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,200
to support the investigation.

138
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,150
1.8 million?

139
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,840
Well, perhaps you can...

140
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,130
.. take a look at the figures
on the way home?

141
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,490
We need to make
some kind of announcement soon.

142
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,869
Indicate some kind of progress,
allay fears.

143
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,370
Some good news.

144
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,350
- I know.
- Where's your car?

145
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,240
- I'll walk you.
- In those shoes?

146
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,940
I'm fine.

147
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,470
Is this your car?

148
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,400
It is, and I'd like him
to get off it.

149
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,040
What are you doing here?

150
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,340
I want all of you
to move away from my car.

151
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,020
What's the difference between
James Olson and a black cab?

152
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,250
Black cab can take five in the back.

153
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,879
What's your name?

154
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,479
What's that got to do with you,
Little Bo Peep,

155
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,060
who's lost her sheep?

156
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,520
Don't come back here again.

157
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,500
You hear me?

158
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,360
You're not welcome.

159
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,580
Mummy?

160
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,320
Mummy?

161
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,540
I've made you a cup of tea.

162
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,779
You know you're not supposed to
boil the kettle.

163
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,210
I haven't.

164
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,979
It's lovely.

165
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,580
When Daddy's back, I'll make
him one too, but with sugar.

166
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,750
<i>Superintendent Gibson?</i>

167
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,129
Detective Superintendent Gibson,

168
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,059
would you like to comment on the
piece in today's Belfast Chronicle?

169
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,969
Are the reports that
the surviving victim

170
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,729
is helping police true?

171
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,039
- They are.
- Are you prepared

172
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,169
to meet Mrs. Olson face-to-face
to discuss

173
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,080
your alleged
affair with her husband?

174
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,329
- I almost didn't recognise you.
- Really?

175
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,839
Why are you wearing that?

176
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,199
The same reason you're wearing that.

177
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,399
- Yours is a Met uniform.
- I'm a Met officer.

178
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,700
At least I was
the last time I checked.

179
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,539
I thought I should look
as unfeminine as possible,

180
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,040
given this morning's Chronicle.

181
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,170
It hasn't worked.

182
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,829
Just to warn you,
Monroe's spoiling for a fight.

183
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,139
There's a strong possibility

184
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,899
he'll push for a 28-day review

185
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,609
into the progress
of the taskforce.

186
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:43,059
- You're joking!
- What?!

187
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,359
You think you're above
such procedures?

188
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,890
Well, who would do it?

189
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,500
Well, we'd find someone.

190
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,980
- What do you want?
- Cappuccino.

191
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,420
Two regular cappuccinos,
please.

192
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,940
Sally.

193
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,400
Sally!

194
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,799
Sally, did you not hear me
calling you?

195
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,300
I'm late for work.

196
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,840
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

197
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,479
I don't understand.

198
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,530
- Don't you?
- No.

199
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,459
- I know everything.
- What are you talking about?

200
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,789
Paul confessed, Katie.

201
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,559
There's no need to cover for him.

202
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,169
- Confessed to what?
- Your affair.

203
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:41,900
Your three-month,
underage affair.

204
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,359
- What? - And in my house.

205
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,539
Under my roof,
in my bed for all I know,

206
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,390
while my children were sleeping.

207
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,179
This is bullshit.

208
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,219
- What did he say about us? - Us? Jesus.

209
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,979
Whatever he's told you, he's lying.

210
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,419
Why would he lie about
something like that?

211
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,420
- I don't know.
- Just leave my family alone.

212
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,339
There's been no affair.

213
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,520
What happened is he attacked me.

214
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,679
What?

215
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,579
That night you left us alone
in the study.

216
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,719
I'd come over to listen to music.

217
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,039
He took the opportunity
to attack me -

218
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,989
pin me to the floor,
climb on top of me...

219
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,339
Enough!

220
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,650
You have no idea who he is
or what he's like.

221
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,500
Ask him about the lock of hair.

222
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,159
What's going on?

223
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,460
Bitch!

224
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,390
<i>You have one new message.</i>

225
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,809
<i>I just bumped into
your girlfriend.</i>

226
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,639
<i>You need to get
your stories straight.</i>

227
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,129
<i>According to her
there's been no affair,</i>

228
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:22,539
<i>just some kind of
sexual assault.</i>

229
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,039
<i>Jesus, Paul,
what did you do to her?</i>

230
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,869
<i>Did you rape her...
in your study,</i>

231
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,600
<i>while the kids were sleeping?</i>

232
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,319
<i>She seems to think
she knows you better than I do.</i>

233
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,449
<i>I don't know, maybe she does.
This is...</i>

234
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,550
<i>this is all so humiliating.</i>

235
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,479
<i>I want you to just stay away,
Paul, OK?</i>

236
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,639
<i>From me, from the kids.
I just...</i>

237
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,980
<i>I want...</i>

238
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,990
BELFAST STRANGLER SURVIVOR
HELPS POLICE

239
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,200
AND WHAT HAVE
THE POLICE BEEN UP TO?

240
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,040
Morning, ma'am.

241
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,640
Yep.

242
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,489
Marion Kay's in the conference room,
ma'am.

243
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,790
Thanks.

244
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:32,380
I was thinking, ma'am,
that I should go back into uniform.

245
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,760
- Really?
- If you can spare me.

246
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,240
I can't.

247
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,200
- Thank you, ma'am. - Tell me why.

248
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,020
I've often wondered why you took me
off the street in the first place.

249
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,250
What do you think?

250
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,230
Because I was...

251
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:08,199
struggling to deal
with what had happened.

252
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,679
Because I couldn't stop myself
from shaking.

253
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,329
I don't go around
rescuing patrol cops

254
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,480
who are disturbed
by what they've seen.

255
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,410
I don't think so.

256
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,660
It was totally selfish.

257
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,710
I was new.

258
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,859
I wanted someone by my side,

259
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,170
someone I felt I could trust.

260
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:36,550
I was impressed by your honesty
at the scene.

261
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,309
I think I've learned a lot.

262
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,640
I think I could put it to good use
on the street.

263
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,389
Cheating death?

264
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,420
Fighting for truth
and justice?

265
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,550
Something like that, yeah.

266
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,680
- I'll think about it.
- Thank you, ma'am.

267
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,320
<i>Sorry, I have
nothing new to tell you.</i>

268
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,120
How is your father bearing up?

269
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,650
That's what everyone
always asks me first.

270
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,920
"How's Daddy?"

271
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,390
It really pisses me off.

272
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:48,499
All the cards,
all the letters of condolence -

273
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,590
they were all addressed to Dad.

274
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,580
Yes, of course.
I'm sorry.

275
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,350
How are you?

276
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,590
It's the right first question.

277
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,200
I know it is.

278
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,250
Fathers aren't supposed
to bury their daughters.

279
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,260
But...

280
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,999
But I can't remember
a time in my life

281
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,150
when Sarah wasn't there.

282
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,879
<i>There are so many "if onlys".</i>

283
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,749
<i>If only she hadn't
turned the police away.</i>

284
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,709
<i>If only the locksmith
had changed</i>

285
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,430
<i>the back door
straightaway.</i>

286
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:44,400
If only I had just made her
come and stay with us.

287
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:50,519
I just wish I could think about
something else.

288
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,890
For five minutes even.

289
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,759
But there is so much stuff
all the time,

290
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,400
in the papers,
on the television...

291
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,950
And it is always Alice's picture.

292
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,380
It's never Sarah.

293
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,240
Today's paper
even got her age wrong.

294
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,700
It's just to do with Alice's name,
I think.

295
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,670
The Monroe connection,
the fund that's been set up.

296
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,510
I worry because there's
a number of victims...

297
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,460
.. Sarah's lost her identity a bit.

298
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,500
Not for me.

299
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,879
- Yeah?
- Rose Stagg has cried off -

300
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,550
pressure of work.

301
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,220
All right.

302
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,909
<i>The train on platform two</i>

303
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:13,019
<i>is the Larne Harbour,
Belfast Central service,</i>

304
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,639
<i>calling at Larne Town,
Glynn,</i>

305
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,209
<i>Magheramorne,
Ballycarry, Whitehead...</i>

306
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:23,039
Rose, I really need
to see you today.

307
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,939
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
I have so much work on.

308
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,579
<i>The interview you gave
was informal.</i>

309
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,330
<i>I took notes,
but...</i>

310
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,269
I really need to get
every last bit

311
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,750
of information
from you, if I can.

312
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,499
Recorded, videoed, transcribed.

313
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,800
I know.

314
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,080
As I told you,

315
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,159
when I met Peter,
I already had a boyfriend.

316
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,460
<i>Yes.</i>

317
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,009
The boyfriend was Tom,
who became my husband.

318
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,859
<i>I presumed that.</i>

319
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,409
<i>And you never told him
what happened?</i>

320
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,919
No.

321
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,219
I had bruises all over my neck,

322
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,759
really bad headaches,

323
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,590
my voice was hoarse.

324
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,270
So I simply stopped seeing him.

325
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:10,920
Rose, I understand it will be
a difficult conversation...

326
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,020
.. but there are bigger issues.

327
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,320
I know.

328
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,650
<i>- Hello?</i>
- I'm here.

329
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,699
<i>Talk to him tonight.</i>

330
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,650
<i>Come and see me tomorrow.</i>

331
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,399
I can come in at noon?

332
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,890
<i>I'll see you then.</i>

333
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,410
<i>He's written
and he's phoned.</i>

334
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,339
He derives pleasure,
it seems,

335
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,379
from involving himself
in the investigation.

336
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:01,199
And for that reason, I'd like to
maintain the 24/7 monitoring
of my old private phone,

337
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,120
in the hope that maybe
he will call that number again.

338
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,549
What kind of response
to the composite likeness?

339
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,959
The Rose Stagg E-FIT?
Good.

340
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,759
The fact it's from eight
or nine years ago has

341
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,479
caused some confusion.

342
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,089
Could he now be fat?
Could he now be bald?

343
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,150
He's definitely not fat.

344
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,610
Do you think that looks like me?

345
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,510
A wee bit, maybe.

346
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,740
May I?

347
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,020
Go ahead.

348
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,330
What about now?

349
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,580
A bit more now.

350
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,620
You think it's safe for me
to go back to Belfast?

351
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,380
I don't think you've got
anything to worry about.

352
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,690
Do you live in the city?

353
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,199
I do.
In South Belfast.

354
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,080
Two streets away from
one of the girls that died.

355
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,650
Do you live alone?

356
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,580
Yeah.

357
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,640
- How about you?
- No.

358
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,810
No, I'm... travelling back
to my wife and two kids.

359
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,240
The only possible excuse

360
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,920
for a grown man to be travelling
with four dollies in his bag.

361
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,689
You're blonde.

362
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:41,140
All the other girls have been dark,
haven't they?

363
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,280
Actually,
I'm not.

364
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,350
- Not what?
- Blonde.

365
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,160
What do you mean?

366
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,610
It was dark,
until all this started happening.

367
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,440
You're kidding.

368
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,380
There.

369
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,040
Proof.

370
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,410
I never would have guessed.

371
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,639
<i>As we know, offenders
tend to commit crimes</i>

372
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,760
<i>in areas that they're familiar with.</i>

373
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,989
<i>The first kill usually
takes place</i>

374
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,899
<i>closest to that
anchor point.</i>

375
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,579
Near a residence or a place of work.

376
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,789
If we look at the spatial
relationships

377
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:43,159
between the crime scenes,
it suggests the offender
lives

378
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,659
in the University Quarter,
or Ravenhill,

379
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:50,219
travelling to and from
the crime scenes on foot.

380
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,809
And that would make
the attack on Annie in the Shankhill

381
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,919
an aberration of sorts.

382
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,229
Presumably,

383
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:00,080
he somehow identified
her as a potential victim -

384
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,610
young, dark, attractive, educated -

385
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:09,039
<i>and disregarded the fact that she
lived outside his natural territory.</i>

386
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,950
<i>And then he got into difficulties
as a result.</i>

387
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,149
We know that he fled on foot.

388
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:17,909
But he didn't run back towards
the University Quarter,

389
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:21,059
he ran out east towards
the city airport.

390
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,069
That's a distance of three miles.

391
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,370
Why?

392
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,530
<i>Perhaps he has a place
out there somewhere.</i>

393
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,479
<i>A lockup
or a storage unit</i>

394
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,300
<i>or somewhere he changes
or keeps a vehicle.</i>

395
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:46,209
A trawl of CCTV cameras
along his route from the Shankhill

396
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:48,980
out towards the airport
has offered up these images.

397
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,840
No clear view of his face.

398
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,520
The possibility he has a beard.

399
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,740
I'm getting some video stills
produced.

400
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,619
He anticipated that we
would use human scent dogs

401
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:06,190
and he crossed a stretch of water.

402
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,929
I believe he took
the murder weapon with him.

403
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,590
The search for that weapon
is still ongoing.

404
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:14,109
Truth is we're pretty much
running out of time

405
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,410
on the search for the weapon.

406
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,039
We've searched miles of the roadway
on the route that we think he took,

407
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,899
right up to the water's edge,
where the scent dogs lost him.

408
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,059
We've run a line
across from that point

409
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,519
to where we think he emerged.

410
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,729
We're searching both sides
of that line.

411
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,759
But the water visibility is nil.

412
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,559
Weeds, refuse.

413
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,959
My divers can only work by touch.

414
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,650
There's deep mud too.

415
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,340
Basically, we've run out of time
and money.

416
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,539
<i>It's been ten days now</i>

417
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,539
and there's been some speculation

418
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:05,080
that the killer has stayed
true to his word.

419
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,870
That he's gone away.

420
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,150
That he's stopped.

421
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,500
I don't believe
that it works that way.

422
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,170
Remember that there is a cycle
that he goes through.

423
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,880
After an attack,
there's a cooling-off period.

424
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:30,650
But then the deviant fantasies
start to kick in,

425
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,080
and the pressure starts to build.

426
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,490
Remember,
it's an addiction.

427
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,139
He takes his...

428
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,480
<i>fantasies
and he turns them into reality.</i>

429
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,700
<i>That makes him feel superior
to the rest of us</i>

430
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,690
<i>mere mortals.</i>

431
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,710
<i>And, as such...</i>

432
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,380
<i>.. in his own mind...</i>

433
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,689
<i>.. he feels he has the right</i>

434
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:06,390
<i>to decide who lives
and who dies.</i>

435
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,590
In order to do the terrible things
that he does,

436
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,850
the killer dehumanises his victims.

437
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,680
Let's do the opposite.

438
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,460
Let's keep them alive.

439
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,839
For us, for their families,

440
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:27,620
friends, work colleagues,
for the public.

441
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,100
Let's keep them alive until...

442
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:33,690
this man is caught.

443
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,660
Jesus!

444
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,200
God, you frightened me.

445
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,839
How did you get in?

446
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,650
Your side door was unlocked.

447
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,990
What are you doing here?

448
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,299
Why'd you say those things
to Sally Ann?

449
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,600
What things?

450
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,959
Things about me.
You and me.

451
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,710
- What things?
- You know what things.

452
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,559
I told you to stay away.

453
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,959
I have.

454
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,180
How was I supposed to know
she'd be there?

455
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,249
Why are you trying
to make trouble for me?

456
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,219
Sally Ann now thinks
that I attacked you

457
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,270
- that night in the study.
- You did.

458
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,089
She thinks I raped you.

459
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:53,679
She thinks we've been having
an affair for months.

460
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,590
Where did she get that idea?

461
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,039
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do. You told her!

462
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,899
- Why would I do that?
- I've been asking myself the same thing.

463
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,209
And?

464
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,510
Katie?

465
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,279
Are you OK?

466
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,350
Yeah.
This is Paul.

467
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,490
I'll be up in a minute.

468
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,450
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

469
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,890
Why are you staring at her?

470
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,590
I'm not.

471
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:31,719
- She's not your type.
- I don't have a type.

472
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,160
- Liar!
- I'm not lying.

473
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,220
Dark-haired, beautiful.

474
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,269
Katie...

475
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:42,170
Why would you lie
to your wife?

476
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,600
What are you covering up?

477
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,620
You're playing a dangerous game.

478
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,400
I came here to tell you to stay away
from my wife and my children.

479
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:58,079
The police officer
on the television said

480
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,230
said the killer clipped a lock
of hair from each of the victims.

481
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,010
You had a lock of hair
in your study.

482
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,850
I explained that.
It was my mother's hair.

483
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,710
I saw the footage of you
at the park, in the Botanic Gardens.

484
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,119
We go there all the time.
It's Olivia's favourite place.

485
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,589
It's also where Sarah Kay
went to meet her sister

486
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:23,400
every Saturday lunchtime.

487
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,000
What are you saying?

488
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,830
You said it, not me.

489
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,450
There's a strangler on the prowl.

490
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,999
And you think it's me?

491
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,289
Sally Ann called me that night
to babysit

492
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,919
because she couldn't
get a hold of you at work.

493
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,279
But then you came home in the middle
of the night with a cut on your face.

494
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,770
You were all weird.

495
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,590
If you think I'm the killer,
why aren't you scared?

496
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,729
- I am scared.
- Are you?

497
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:51,039
Yes.

498
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,759
- You think I'm going to strangle you?
- Yes.

499
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,160
And your little friend upstairs?

500
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,620
Do you really think the killer
would identify himself so easily?

501
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,600
Grow up, Katie.

502
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,099
I'm just a husband, a father,

503
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,599
a man with a profession to protect.

504
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,049
Keep your crazy theories to yourself

505
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:32,110
and stay away from my family.

506
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,440
<i>- Round the side there.
- Yeah.</i>

507
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,539
<i>You have reached the
offices of the Alice Monroe Fund.</i>

508
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:45,649
<b>Your office recommended your
services as bereavement consellor.</b>

509
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:47,500
I'm Paul Spector.

510
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,560
<i>All right, haul her up.</i>

511
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,440
We're finished here,
ma'am.

512
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,839
Can you give me
a couple more hours?

513
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,610
I don't know, ma'am.

514
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,280
We'll find the money.

515
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,109
<i>- I'm hungry.
- Well, you ate at Grandma's.</i>

516
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:47,479
<i>That was ages ago.</i>

517
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,680
<i>I'll make you some warm milk, OK?</i>

518
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,979
<i>Livvy, ten minutes till bedtime.</i>

519
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:54,760
<i>Brush your teeth.</i>

520
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:13,899
<i>"Dear Olivia,</i>

521

522

525
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,919

526
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,060
<i>"Have another look.

527
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,139
<i>"I will see you very soon.</i>

528
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:41,839

00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,359

530

531
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,660
<i>"to be kept a secret."</i>

532
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,519
Is this true?

533
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,680
Well, it's in the paper.
It must be.

534
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,279
Why do you want to know?

535
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,559
I did the autopsy on James Olson.

536
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,689
I know. You showed me the pictures.

537
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:53,199
I had no idea that you had
a personal relationship with him

538
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,500
when I did that.

539
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,680
There were scratches on his back,

540
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,449
consistent with marks
left by fingernails.

541
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:07,059
Fresh marks.

542
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,699
The most obvious explanation
was sex.

543
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,019
And that suggestion
was put to his wife

544
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:15,100
and she said
she was not responsible.

545
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:17,719
I see.

546
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,319
And at no point did
DCI Eastwood suggest

547
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,889
that visiting you
in your hotel room

548
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:23,790
was part of Olson's time line.

549
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:27,260
So the marks went unaccounted for
in my report.

550
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,550
I'm surprised by that.

551
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,550
By what?

552
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:39,400
By Eastwood withholding that.

553
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,100
You didn't ask him to?

554
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,380
No.

555
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:58,080
So, was it you...
who made those marks?

556
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,640
They don't feel sharp.

557
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,380
No.

558
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,210
Not any more.

559
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,200
How did you come to meet him?

560
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,920
I saw him.

561
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,079
On the street.

562
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,190
At a crime scene.

563
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,570
I thought I would be
in Belfast for a...

564
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,190
a week, maybe two.

565
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:08,080
I didn't think he'd be shot
the next night.

566
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:12,390
I'm sorry he's dead.

567
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,490
I really am.

568
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,690
But it was one night.

569
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,090
It didn't mean anything.

570
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,269
Excuse me, ma'am.

571
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:28,170
The divers might
have found something.

572
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,760
Mummy?
Mummy?

573
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,580
I need the bathroom.

574
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,800
What?

575
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,290
I need to do a wee.

576
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,550
- Ask Daddy.
- Where is he?

577
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,910
I'm so tired,
sweetheart.

578
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:32,310
Who are you?

579
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,550
Don't wake Mummy.

580
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,659
Are you a friend
of Mummy's or Daddy's?

581
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:37,300
Your mummy.

582
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,070
What's your name?

583
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,840
Peter.

584
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,600
Peter Piper.

585
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:56,099
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

586
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,099
A peck of pickled peppers
Peter Piper picked.

587
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:00,009
If Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers,

588
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:03,010
where's the peck of pickled peppers
Peter Piper picked?

589
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,249
That's called a tongue twister.

590
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:07,550
You try it.

591
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,969
- Peter Piper picked...
- .. a peck of pickled peppers.

592
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:13,769
Where's the pickled peppers
that Peter Piper picked?

593
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:15,279
Do it again but do it faster.

594
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,839
Peter Piper picked a pep of...

595
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,149
.. peppers.

596
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:20,019
Where's the peck of peppers
that Peter Piper picked?

597
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:22,199
That's really good.
Just not too loud.

598
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,659
We don't want to wake Mummy.

599
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:25,759
Where are you sleeping?

600
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,780
I'll find somewhere.

601
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,379
Where's your room?

602
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:32,600
I'll show you.

603
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,920
- Where's Mummy sleeping?
- In there.

604
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,450
That's nice.

605
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,240
I'm sorry.

606
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,960
Me too.

607
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,060
I want you to come with me now.

608
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,450
I want to talk to you.

609
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,850
I don't want to have to
hurt you, Rose.

610
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,039
I don't want to have to hurt
your beautiful family.

611
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,510
But I will.

612
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:16,190
I will if you scream or cry out
when I release you.

613
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,480
Do you understand?

614
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:21,080
OK.

615
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:26,920
One, two, three.

616
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:44,360
Peter?

617

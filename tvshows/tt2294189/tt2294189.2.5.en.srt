1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,049
I'm pretty sure that you
referred to Spector by name.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:04,809
- Are you certain?
- If you did,

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,469
he knows that we're on to him.

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,620
<i>I was due to see Mr. Spector,</i>
but is he the target?

5
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,009
<i>A hairdresser's booked to see Annie, today.</i>

6
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,329
She's been cancelled, too.

7
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,980
But you let me come all the way
in here before turning me away?

8
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,759
<i>- We have a problem.</i>
- What?

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,280
<i>We have a collapsed ceiling.</i>

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,369
What is that?

11
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,879
<i>A body has been found.
A female.</i>

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,590
- Where?
<i>- The Belfast Hills.</i>

13
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,849
It's not her.
It's not Rose.

14
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,859
Well,
she's unidentified as yet.

15
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,009
Perhaps I can use her for 12 hours?

16
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,129
<i>Do you know a detective
called Tom Anderson?</i>

17
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,689
Detective Sergeant, West Belfast.

18
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,499
I thought he might make a
useful addition to our team.

19
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,379
Nurture your envy, Katie.

20
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,449
<i>Your anger.
It's the way forward.</i>

21
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,150
What is it you want me to do?

No sign of any builders,
plumbers at the house?

27
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,889
No, Ma'am.

28
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,950
The target appears to
be playing loud music.

"The Fall"

32
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,629
<i>You'll find in front
of you a target profile</i>

33
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,259
<i>on Peter Paul Spector.</i>

34
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,409
There's no date and time,

35
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,689
and the precise wording of the
arrest is yet to be formalized.

36
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,889
I'll do that with the officer nominated

37
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,499
and briefed to make the arrest.

38
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,609
I personally like
the arresting officer

39
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,110
to be the first interviewing
officer, if possible.

40
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,169
Do you have someone in mind?

41
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,639
- I do.
- I've made some enquiries.

42
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,140
That seems like
it might work.

43
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,800
Good.

44
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,409
So far, we've found no
official record for Paul Spector

45
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,979
further back than his
marriage to Sally-Ann Goodall.

46
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,889
We're still waiting on John
Paul Spector's army records,

47
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,589
but one thing we do now know

48
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,809
is that Paul Spector is not Jewish.

49
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,589
His father was born John Paul Marshall.

50
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,569
Marshall was adopted by the Spectors,
who were indeed a Jewish couple.

51
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,379
They devoted most of their lives

52
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,779
to adopting and fostering children,

53
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,169
regardless of their race,
colour or creed.

54
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,249
Thoroughly good people, it seems.

55
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,659
- Where was this?
- North London.

56
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,889
Is John Paul Spector
still alive, do we know?

57
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,990
He's alive and in prison.

58
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,600
- Where?
- Canada.

59
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,269
- In prison for?
- Murder.

60
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,010
- A female victim?
- Male.

61
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,649
I'm not sure if you remember me?
Jim Burns.

62
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,480
Of course I remember you.

63
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,570
I've followed your
career with some interest.

64
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,410
If I may, I'll get straight to the point.

65
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,609
I want to know if
you remember this boy

66
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,150
from your time
at Gortnacul Orphanage.

67
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,289
I believe he was there
from the age of 10 to 13,

68
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,729
from 1989 to 1992.

69
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,890
Is this to do with the recent
spate of sexual murders?

70
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,969
Why do you ask that?

71
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,259
It must be something
of pressing importance

72
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,760
to bring the Assistant Chief Constable
all the way out here to see me.

73
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,210
Is this your man?

74
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,030
What can you tell me about him?

75
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,530
He was a very pretty boy.

76
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,969
I've been following the
progress of the case,

77
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,430
in the newspapers, on the news,
with considerable interest.

78
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,280
All those poor murdered girls.

79
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,959
There's a great deal of consternation
among the general public.

80
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,889
I'm well aware of that.

81
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,489
- I'd like to help.
- You can.

82
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,249
By telling me what you
remember about that boy.

83
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,909
- Would you call me Father?
- You've been defrocked,

84
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,129
dismissed from the clerical state.

85
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,489
- You are no longer a priest.
- Do you know what is sung

86
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,120
at a priest's ordination?

87
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,379
"You are a priest forever,
like Melchizedek of old."

88
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,559
A priest acts on Earth
as an alter Christus

89
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,629
that is,
as another Christ!

90
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,329
I know one of your victims
believed that he was being

91
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,709
touched by the hand of God
while you were molesting him,

92
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,129
- because that's what you told him.
- All of those boys

93
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:42,029
were willing participants.
Everyone of them consented.

94
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,310
I never forced myself on anyone.

95
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,070
They wanted to learn about sex...

96
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,060
... explore their sexual identities.

97
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,280
They enjoyed it.

98
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,069
If they deny that now,

99
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,329
it's because they can't
face their real natures.

100
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,890
A child's consent does not count.

101
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,799
What you were doing

102
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,769
had nothing to do with
exploring their sexuality

103
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,089
and everything to do with
misusing power and abusing trust.

104
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,009
I never hurt a boy physically.

105
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,490
And that's a source of pride?
Is it?

106
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,180
Do you feel no shame?

107
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,209
-No guilt?
- Why should I?

108
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,329
Shame for who you are.

109
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,249
Guilt at what you've done.

110
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,389
I was showing children
love, expressing affection.

111
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,689
By performing oral sex on 12-year-olds?

112
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,989
How many of those boys still
have faith in the Catholic church,

113
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,929
still have faith in God, do you think?

114
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,509
It's a disgrace that I'm
thought of as a common criminal

115
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,859
and all the good work I did over
almost 30 years is forgotten.

116
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,709
Even in this place, I continue my vocation.

117
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,889
A man dying on the
floor of his cell

118
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,499
begged me for the last rites.
What would you have me do?

119
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,780
Turn away from him?
Refuse to confer absolution?

120
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,589
I was obliged to dispense the sacraments,

121
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,849
because an indelible
priestly character

122
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,169
remains on my soul.
I absolved sin.

123
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,229
One word from my lips
transformed mere bread

124
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,629
and wine into divine flesh and blood.

125
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,209
That power can never be taken away from me.

126
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,810
This was a mistake.

127
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,209
I shouldn't have come here.

128
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,020
- Give me the photograph.
- You're an important man.

129
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,519
You could let it be known
that I will lead the community

130
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,780
in sincere prayer
for the apprehension
of this individual.

131
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:29,239
Say, say tomorrow at noon.

132
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,820
Men, women, children.

133
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,670
It could be a mighty force.

134
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,689
I'm sure there are plenty
of priests

135
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,949
who could lead
the community in prayer.

136
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,169
Priests who aren't pederasts
serving a 20 year prison sentence.

137
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,029
I can perform any
religious ritual

138
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,780
that is permitted to any lay
person and no-one can stop me.

139
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:58,790
- Let me have the photograph.
- Father. Call me Father.

140
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,710
No.

141
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,400
Then I won't tell you
what I know about this boy.

142
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,169
<i>I don't think I can.</i>

143
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,849
<i>I don't know
what's going to happen.</i>

144
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,280
<i>I don't...
I don't...</i>

145
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,609
<i>I had an early night myself.</i>

146
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:22,929
<i>It's a beautiful night</i>

147
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,239
<i>... night.
... night.</i>

148
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,659
The first example is the known
recording of Spector's voice

149
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,529
from his interview with DCI Brink.

150
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,080
The second, the call
from Rose Stagg's phone.

151
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,340
<i>I don't think I can. I don't
know what's going to happen.</i>

152
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,980
<i>I don't...
I don't...</i>

153
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,060
<i>I had an early night myself.</i>

154
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,679
<i>It's a beautiful night</i>

155
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,980
<i>... night.
... night.</i>

156
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,299
Normally,
20 or more different words

157
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,329
are needed for a
meaningful comparison.

158
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,849
Comparing two voice samples
of less than 20 words

159
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,999
results in a less
conclusive opinion.

160
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,569
Possibly instead
of probably.

161
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,229
The call from Rose Stagg's phone

162
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,530
was very possibly
made by Paul Spector.

163
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,220
It has been four days
since Rose went missing.

164
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,129
Delaying the arrest in the hope
that the suspect leads us to her

165
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:14,340
runs a number of very
clear and obvious risks.

166
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,380
Risks that I think we have to take.

167
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,189
<i>Hey, this is Katie. Can't
come to the phone right now.</i>

168
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,190
<i>Leave a message
and I'll call you back.</i>

169
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,189
Hi. It's me.
I'm outside.

170
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,770
<i>Have you left already?</i>

171
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,130
<i>I can't really wait, so...</i>

172
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,790
I'll see you at school.
Bye.

173
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,449
<i>These are the thermal images
from last night, ma'am.</i>

174
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,920
The only heat signatures are livestock.

175
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,689
Is that all Goodall land?

176
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,080
Yeah, there's the farmhouse.

177
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,529
- What's that?
- That's your derelict building.

178
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,610
Perhaps it's on the list.
We'll take a look later.

179
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,179
No sign of Rose Stagg's car?

180
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,619
No, ma'am.

181
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,649
We'll extend the
search further south today.

182
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,660
We need to find that car, Jed.

183
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,639
<i>From Three. That's the
Benedetto girl into the bank,</i>

184
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,089
<i>on Waring Street.
I no longer have.</i>

185
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,960
From Three. That's the Benedetto
girl into the bank, Waring Street.

186
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,090
Three no longer has, running
loose. Five, can you cover?

187
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,040
From Five.
Entering the bank.

188
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,699
Message from Control, ma'am.

189
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,449
The Benedetto girl
has cut school.

190
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,950
She's on the move.

191
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,980
<i>From Five,
I now have.</i>

192
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,529
- Where is she?
- In a bank

193
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,790
on Waring Street, ma'am.
Five now has.

194
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,359
<i>From Five.</i>

195
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,070
<i>She's making a cash withdrawal.
Looks like a large amount.</i>

196
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,919
From Five.
That's the Benedetto girl

197
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,529
out of the bank on Waring Street,

198
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,540
<i>walking briskly
towards the river.</i>

199
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,239
What's the word on Spector?

200
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,750
Sitting tight, ma'am.

201
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,209
<i>From Five.
The Benedetto girl</i>

202
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,410
<i>is on the footbridge
at Lagan Weir.</i>

203
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,019
From Four.
She's fixed a lock to the fence

204
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,549
and thrown away the key.

205
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,769
<i>A padlock that says "Katie
and Paul" with today's date.</i>

206
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,130
A love lock?

207
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,790
From Four. The target is heading
back towards Custom House Square.

208
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,599
From X-ray One,
stand by, stand by.

209
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,529
<i>That's the target
out of the house.</i>

210
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:50,989
<i>Blue and grey hooded top. Black
track suit bottoms. On foot.</i>

211
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,619
Left, left towards the
Lisburn Road. Now running.

212
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,929
<i>He's running.
Repeat, he's running loose.</i>

213
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,049
<i>Left, left towards Lisburn Road.
Unsighted.</i>

214
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,259
Out for a run
or making a run for it?

215
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,649
<i>From X-ray One, target
is wearing a back pack.</i>

216
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,579
- Jesus!
- From X-ray One.

217
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,309
That's the target
out of the house.

218
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:12,689
Left, left towards the Lisburn
Road. Now running unsighted.

219
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,490
All call signs respond.

220
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:18,149
<i>It's Gibson.
Is the surveillance blown?</i>

221
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,259
<i>From Delta,
not possible to say.</i>

222
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,709
<i>Have eyes on target running loose,</i>

223
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,899
<i>Ulsterville Avenue

224

<i>Arrest strategy not yet in
place. Follow. Do not lose.</i>

225
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,569
Target now crossing
Lisburn Road.

226
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,559
<i>Repeat,

229
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,659
heading towards Malone Road.

230
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,929
<i>One-way street,
unable to pursue.</i>

231
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:45,139
From Delta, that's the target
crossing the Lisburn Road

232
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,309
into College Gardens heading
towards the Malone Road.

233
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,519
Call signs that can back Delta, come in.

00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,329
<i>Golf, I can.</i>

235

<i>All call signs.</i>

00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,719
I need cars blocking all exits.

242
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,680
Golf and Delta drop two men
on foot to cover the gardens.

243
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,719
<i>From Golf.</i>

<i>on Bleecker Street,

259
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,729
From four. The Benedetto girl has

260
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,230
entered the Bleecker Street
Hotel. Running loose.

261
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,739
What's happening?

262
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,699
- We lost him.
- What?!

263
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,089
We think he's somewhere
in the Botanic Gardens.

264
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,129
We have cars covering every exit.

265
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,919
All available surveillance
operatives are in the gardens on foot.

<i>Room 12 is registered in
the name of Paul Spector.</i>

268
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,960
Call in the uniforms.
Spector's room is a crime scene.

269
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,530
It needs to be treated accordingly.

270
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,559
Get down on your knees.
Get down on your knees!

271
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,880
This is my hotel!
<i>It's my hotel!</i>

- What?

274
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,730
I can't walk the
corridors of me own hotel?

275
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,849
Police.

276
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,150
Open the door!

00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,249
<i>Police!
Open up!</i>

Open the door!

Police, open the door!

280
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:56,319
Katie, calm down.
You are under arrest.

281
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,250
- Get off!
- Just stop moving!

282
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,830
Get off!

283

<i>Alpha Papa One

We have the Benedetto girl.

00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:58,799
<i>We believe the girl has attempted
to destroy vital evidence.</i>

286
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,449
<i>It might be necessary to
conduct a strip search.</i>

287
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,409
Assign Hagstrom
responsibility for her care.

288
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:08,030
We need to provide access
to an appropriate adult

289
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:12,249
and put her in a detention
room, not in a... not in a cell.

290
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,550
<i>Understood.</i>

291
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,890
Thanks.

<i>From Bravo.
No sign of target.</i>

293

<i>From Delta.
No sign of target.</i>

295
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,199
From the south?

296
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,729
I went to see Father Jensen,

297
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,159
the pederast who ran
the orphanage at Gotnacul

298
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,119
where Spector was
when he was a boy.

299
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,480
He remembered him well.

300
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:41,790
- Peter Baldwin?
- PB.

301
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:46,950
- Was he abused by Jensen?
- Jensen says not.

302
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,029
At 13 he was moved to Ballyvale,

303
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,769
it's a home in Dundalk.

304
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,349
It was there that it seems

305
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,000
his criminal behaviour began.

306
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:57,840
And you were right,

307
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:01,579
breaking and entering,
ignoring valuables,

308
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,280
taking underwear.

309
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,330
And he kept a journal too,
it seems.

310
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,579
Voyeur's map of the town.

311
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,759
Days of the week,
times of the day and night,

313
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,350
notes about their appearance,
age, habits.

314
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:22,280
- Has prison changed Jensen?
- No.

315
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:26,630
He's just as arrogant,
just as narcissistic.

316
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:31,669
- He's unrepentant.
<i>- From Seven, no sign of target.</i>

317
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,450
Where the fuck is he?

318
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,390
Will you look who it is?

319
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:59,350
Stop that!
Stop that!

320
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,980
Move back.
Go! Move!

321
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:08,790
Get down on your knees!

322
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,510
Get down on your knees!

323
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,990
GET DOWN on your knees!

324
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,870
Where's my wife?

325
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,409
What?

326
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:32,130
Liz?
Where is she?

327
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,300
I don't know, Jimmy.

328
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:41,149
Tell me, or so help me I'll
blow your fucking brains out!

329
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:43,529
I swear to you, Jimmy, I
don't know where she is.

330
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:44,830
Find out.

331
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,950
How?

332
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:52,009
Make some calls.
Now.

333
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,990
Find out where she is.

334
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,880
I don't have my phone.

335
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,290
Make some calls.

336
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,859
Gibson.

337
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,569
Responding to an
emergency call, ma'am.

338
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:19,319
<i>- The back of Elmwood Mews.</i>
- Elmwood Mews?

339
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,879
The person who phoned it in
described two men

340
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,989
in bomber jackets, jeans and
the third in dark running gear.

341
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,299
It made me think of the CCTV
footage of Spector running.

342
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,200
<i>- How far away are you?</i>
- Minutes.

343
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,620
All right, stay on the line.

344
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:34,780
It's just... I need to
follow up, for my case notes.

345
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,460
I really need to see her in person.

346
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:40,490
Elizabeth Tyler.

347
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,650
Paul Spector.

348
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,180
She was in therapy because
of the death of her son,

349
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,720
not because of domestic abuse.

350
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,450
That therapy was interrupted.

351
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:58,860
Obviously, I'll treat any
information as confidential.

352
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,750
She's asking her superior.

353
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,309
My knees are hurting. Can I get up?

354
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,020
You fucking can't get up!

355
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,980
It's lovely music.

356
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,110
What?

357
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,690
They got me on hold.

358
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,150
What's in your bag?

359
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,249
What?

360
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,940
Give me your bag.
Give me it.

361
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:31,590
<i>Danny?
Danny?</i>

362
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,209
What the fuck!

363
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,709
Put the gun down! Nobody move, nobody move!

364
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:42,020
Keep your hands in the air! Keep
your hands where I can see them!

365
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,450
Stay where you are!
Don't move!

366
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:56,929
For fuck's sake!

367
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,239
<i>Danny,
can you hear me?</i>

368
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,600
You OK?

369
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:01,670
<i>Danny?</i>

370
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:08,329
Sorry, ma'am.
<i>We've had a contact.</i>

371
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,689
Were you hit?

372
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:12,359
<i>Yeah.</i>
One in the flack jacket.

373
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,900
<i>And Spector?
Is it Spector?</i>

374
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,750
Yes, ma'am.

375
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,110
One moment.

376
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:34,449
The suspect has fled the scene
in a White City Clampers Van.

377
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:37,409
He's er, six foot two,
dark jeans, dark jacket.

378
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:40,299
He's bleeding from his face.
He's taken my partner's gun!

379
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,150
Establish an outer cordon!

380
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,319
<i>Danny?</i>

381
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,949
- Sorry, ma'am.
- Is Spector still there?

382
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,250
Yes, ma'am.

383
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,490
<i>Any injuries?
Head injuries?</i>

384
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,269
No, ma'am.
He's er...

385
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,629
I think he's bleeding from the...
<i>nose.</i>

386
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:57,369
OK. Don't let them take
him to the hospital.

387
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,769
Danny, do you hear me?

388
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,990
<i>Just keep him at the scene.</i>

389
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:02,990
Yes, ma'am.

390
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,859
I've told the Custody Sergeant
at the Serious Crime Suite

391
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,160
that you're on your way.

392
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,990
Can I help?

393
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,850
Yes, you can.

394
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,910
From X-ray One. Stand by.

395
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:35,449
That's the target's wife arriving
at the house in the Volvo.

396
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,629
Control.
Target's wife arriving at house.

397
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,530
<i>X-ray One, wait out.</i>

398
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:31,269
That man was on his back,

399
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,329
more or less as
he's lying now.

400
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:36,009
Then he made a move,
raised his gun.

401
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:38,299
That's when the male officer
fired again.

402
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,600
Two more shots.

403
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:50,009
Now just bring the wrist up.
Don't let me push it forward.

404
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,659
Don't let me push it back.
Thank you.

405
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,810
Just don't let me push down.

406
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,990
Burns.

407
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,690
Understood, yeah.

408
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,680
Mr. Spector.

409
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:16,929
Thank you for your statements.
We have your number and address.

410
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,380
We'll be in touch if we
need anything more from you.

411
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:22,810
This is Paul Spector. He's not
worn any protective clothing.

412
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,100
Sign him out.

413
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:24,450
Paul Spector.

414
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,750
Detective Sergeant Anderson.

415
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:31,939
I am arresting you for the
unlawful imprisonment of Rose Stagg.

416
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,469
You do not have to say anything

417
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,729
but it may harm your
defence if you do not mention

418
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:38,279
when questioned something
you later rely on in court.

419
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,269
Anything you do say may
be given in evidence.

420
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,570
Do you understand?

421
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,110
<i>Police officers!</i>

422
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:26,649
- Sally-Ann Spector?
- Yes?

423
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:29,879
- DC Glen Martin, DC McNally.
- What's happened?

424
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,789
Sally-Ann Spector,
I am arresting you

425
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:34,189
on suspicion of perverting
the course of justice.

426
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,369
- What?!
- You do not have to say anything,

427
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:38,879
but it may harm your defence
if you do not mention when questioned

428
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,849
something you later rely on in court.

429
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:43,760
Anything you do say may
be given in evidence.

430
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,760
Your mother's here to see you.

431
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:16,049
I don't want to see her.

432
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,489
Katie, you are a juvenile.

433
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:20,149
The law requires an appropriate adult

434
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:23,190
- to be present during your custody.
- Not her.

435
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,710
Not her.

436
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:43,659
They came to the house
and arrested me

437
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:47,169
and they've bought me to the
Down... Serious Crime Unit.

438
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,069
<i>- Slow down, Sally.</i>
- I'm sorry.

439
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,959
<i>Why have you been arrested?</i>

440
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,109
Perverting the course of justice.

441
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,549
<i>In what way?</i>

442
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:58,259
They suspect that I lied
when they asked me about Paul.

443
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,759
<i>What about Paul?</i>

444
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,289
Where he was the night that girl died.

445
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,380
<i>- What girl?</i>
- The one in the park.

446
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,230
<i>Did you lie?</i>

447
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:10,950
Yes.

448
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:17,389
<i>- Is this your one phone call?</i>
- Yes.

449
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,690
<i>Sally!</i>

450
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:21,120
<i>I'm not a criminal solicitor.</i>

451
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,089
<i>I should contact a colleague.</i>

452
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:25,540
<i>It's important you don't
incriminate yourself.</i>

453
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,620
I'm pregnant, Steve.

454
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,150
Please, help me.

455
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,760
Please remove your top layer, sir.

456
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,470
Shoes.

457
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:29,839
Both the Benedetto girl and Spector

458
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,449
have mobile devices
with video files on them.

459
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:34,689
Should we prioritise Spector's?

460
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,750
Yeah.
Definitely.

461
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,380
Downloading now, ma'am.

462
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:13,940
I must advise you this
interview is being recorded.

463
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,959
I am Detective Constable Glen Martin.

464
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,519
Detective Constable Gail
McNally is also present.

465
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,209
The suspect's name is Sally-Ann Spector.

466
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:27,139
Also present is the suspect's
solicitor, Stephen Jennings.

467
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,169
It is 22 hundred hours

468
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:32,120
on Monday,
May the seventh.

469
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:35,980
This interview is taking place
in the Down Serious Crime Suite.

470
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:40,079
I'd like each person here
to identify themselves

471
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,430
on tape for voice
identification purposes.

472
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:45,169
DC Gail McNally.

473
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:47,350
Steve Jennings, solicitor.

474
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:51,750
Sally?

475
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:55,920
Sally-Ann Spector.

476
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:00,329
Just to make it clear, Sally...

477
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,709
<i>The offence you're
being investigated for</i>

478
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,980
<i>is perverting the course of justice.</i>

479
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:09,029
<i>What I'm going to do, is ask you
to give an account of the answers</i>

480
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:13,529
<i>you gave me when I telephoned
you on Saturday 21st of April,</i>

481
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,979
<i>and asked you to give an
account of your husband,</i>

482
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:20,060
<i>Paul Spector's movements on
a series of specific dates.</i>

483
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,749
<i>I believe the account you gave me was false</i>

484
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:26,900
<i>and amounted to an attempt to
pervert the course of justice.</i>

485
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,310
<i>Do you understand?</i>

486
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,350
<i>Yes.</i>

487
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:38,690
<i>Tell me in your own words how
you came to give me that account.</i>

488
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,110
<i>I lied.</i>

489
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,270
<i>I lied to you.</i>

490
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:54,870
He called me before he went
into the police station.

491
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:59,139
He said the police would
probably come round to see me

492
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:02,190
and ask me to confirm what
he was about to tell them.

493
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:06,189
He asked me to lie

494
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:08,740
and say that I'd been
with him that night...

495
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:12,970
... that we were at home together.

496
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:17,090
What reason did he give, Sally?

497
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,539
When he called, he didn't give a reason.

498
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,440
So you just did what he asked?

499
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,650
Yes.

500
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,790
Did he ever give a reason?

501
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:35,960
Er... Yes, when he came
back from the station.

502
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,750
Tell them, Sally.

503
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:54,259
Paul worked on a suicide
help line,

504
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,560
as a volunteer,

505
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:58,489
every Friday night,

506
00:41:58,490 --> 00:41:59,899
all night,

507
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,820
and some other nights as well.

508
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:06,380
Or at least that's where I thought he was.

509
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:09,749
When he came back,

510
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,949
he told me
that he hadn't actually gone to work

511
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,590
for the last three months.

512
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:17,350
That he'd been having an affair.

513
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:25,350
<i>Take your time.</i>

514
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:31,670
<i>He was having an affair...</i>

515
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:35,120
<i>with our baby-sitter.</i>

516
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:39,620
<i>She was 15 at the time.</i>

517
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,750
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

518
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:46,949
He said that if I told the
police

519
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:49,950
that he'd be put on the
sex offender's list,

520
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:52,720
that he'd go to prison,

521
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:56,050
that I might even lose my job.

522
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,700
Is that what all of this is about?

523
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:05,830
You understand that
you're under a caution?

524
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:10,930
I should also remind you

525
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:16,890
that you have a right to free
and independent legal advice...

526
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:22,689
... and that you can talk to
a solicitor on the telephone

527
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,400
if you so wish.

528
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:30,650
That light indicates the
interview is being monitored.

529
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:34,480
You've been arrested

530
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:39,010
because we believe that on
the night of Thursday May 3rd,

531
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,720
you abducted
Rose Veronica Stagg from her home.

532
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:48,209
We also believe that you
have unlawfully imprisoned

533
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:49,510
Rose Stagg...

534
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:54,440
... that you're holding her
somewhere against her will.

535
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:00,230
You may know Rose Stagg
better as Rose McGill.

536
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,920
Your wife has been arrested.

537
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:11,900
Your home is being searched.

538
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:15,550
Katie Benedetto has been arrested.

539
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:20,500
The hotel room you were
staying in, is being searched.

540
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:23,359
Things could get out of control

541
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,669
for you

542
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:26,650
very quickly, Paul.

543
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:32,450
<i>Are you sure you don't want to speak?</i>

544
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:39,119
All the files have downloaded
from Spector's phone.

545
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,210
There are some videos you should see.

546
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,110
<i>My wrists are sore.</i>

547
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,080
<i>Can you untie me, please?</i>

548
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:56,700
<i>Peter, can you unloosen these, please?</i>

549
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:03,170
<i>I'm thirsty.</i>

550
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:07,360
<i>Can you untie me, please!</i>

551
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:12,490
<i>Please.
Please, can you untie me?</i>

552
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:17,999
<i>Please, take me home.</i>

553
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,409
<i>My babies will be missing me.</i>

554
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:24,849
<i>They're only little, they're
young, they need me, Peter,</i>

555
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,720
<i>they need me, Peter.</i>

556
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:37,210
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

557
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:43,630
<i>You were right. I did go to the police.</i>

558
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:46,499
Go to the police.

559
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,300
<i>I never will again,</i>

560
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:51,039
<i>if you untie me now,</i>

561
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,689
<i>I won't tell anybody what's happened.</i>

562
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:55,410
<i>Please, Peter.</i>

563
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:58,680
<i>Please, Peter, would you talk to me?</i>

564
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:10,430
<i>I miss what we had, I do.</i>

565
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:16,409
<i>Tom, he's not like you.</i>

566
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:21,190
<i>You. No-one's like you.</i>

567
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:27,389
<i>Untie me and we can have what we had again.</i>

568
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:29,350
<i>It can be better.</i>

569
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:32,700
<i>I know it's wrong,
but I'm...</i>

570
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:35,850
<i>so turned on.</i>

571
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:38,610
<i>Are you?</i>

572
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,010
<i>Are you?</i>

573
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:44,390
<i>Peter?</i>

574
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:49,959
<i>You fucking disgust me,</i>

575
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,549
<i>you fucking piece of shit,
you fucking worm!</i>

576
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:57,200
<i>I know it's you, you pervert.</i>

577
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:00,300
<i>You fucking pervert,</i>

578
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:03,959
<i>you dickless piece of shit.</i>

579
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,560
<i>You're a monster, you're a monster,</i>

580
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:12,289
<i>you're a monster, you're
a fucking aberration!</i>

581
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:14,500
<i>Fuck you,
fuck you!</i>

582
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:26,190
<i>Peter, please take me home.</i>

583
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:45,289
<i>You must have had a terrible
childhood to do this to me.</i>

584
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:47,430
<i>I feel sorry for you,</i>

585
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:50,769
<i>I really do.</i>

586
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:52,859
<i>You must have had a
terrible childhood.</i>

587
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:55,060
<i>I feel sorry for you.</i>

588
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:03,390
<i>I don't want to die here, Peter, please!</i>

589
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:19,300
<i>You want to be noticed.</i>

590
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:24,890
<i>You want to be paid
attention to, make your mark?</i>

591
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:31,190
<i>Fine. Hurt me, do whatever you want to me,</i>

592
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:33,670
<i>go ahead,</i>

593
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:35,999
<i>do your worst.</i>

594
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,439
Nothing you can do

595
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,579
<i>will ever take away how
much I love my husband,</i>

596
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,180
<i>how much I love my children.</i>

597
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:49,359
<i>Nothing you can do can make
me devalue my life in any way.</i>

598
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,209
<i>I will celebrate life.</i>

599
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:53,849
<i>I love and I am loved</i>

600
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:57,329
<i>and nothing that you can
do can take that away!</i>

601
00:48:57,330 --> 00:49:00,580
<i>Do you know that?!</i>

602
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,170
<i>Why the fuck are you
watching this?</i>

603
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:12,280
<i>You sick shit?</i>

604
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,590
<i>What the fuck is wrong with you?</i>

605
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:46,969
I think it's time for
a special warning.

606
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:49,129
See if we can't make it
that a court draws an adverse

607
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:52,289
inference from Spector's
refusal to answer questions.

608
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:53,810
I'll pass it on.

609
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:19,499
I want you to
listen carefully

610
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,460
to what I'm about to say, Paul.

611
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:26,450
I'm now going to ask you
to account for a fact.

612
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:30,720
The reason I'm asking you to do this...

613
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:37,160
... is because I believe this fact
shows that you're responsible,

614
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:40,280
for the abduction

615
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:42,890
and unlawful imprisonment

616
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,100
of Rose Stagg.

617
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:49,390
<i>I must warn you that a record
is being made of this interview</i>

618
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:54,220
<i>and may be given in evidence
if you're brought to trial.</i>

619
00:50:56,450 --> 00:51:00,169
And that the court may draw
proper inference from your silence

620
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:02,939
if you fail or refuse

621
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:06,559
to account for the fact about
which you're being questioned.

622
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,730
Do you understand?

623
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:27,529
<i>I'm asking you to account for
the presence on your phone,</i>

624
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:30,780
<i>the phone found in your possession
at the time of your arrest,</i>

625
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:34,559
of a number of video files

626
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,969
featuring the image
of Rose Stagg

627
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:39,990
and the sound of her voice.

628
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:44,790
And images of you.

629
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:50,280
What is your explanation for those
files being found on your phone?

630
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:58,310
<i>Granny!</i>

631
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:01,299
<i>They've finished questioning
your daughter, Mrs. Goodall,</i>

632
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,859
<i>and they're keeping her in custody.</i>

633
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:05,369
Will you be seeing
her again tonight?

634
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:08,920
<i>I won't, unfortunately, but I will
see her first thing in the morning.</i>

635
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:12,449
- Give her my love.
<i>- Granny!</i>

636
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:15,500
<i>I will.
You try not to worry.</i>

637
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:20,710
<i>Granny,
is that Daddy on the phone?!</i>

638
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:37,200
- Gibson.
<i>- It's Christine Larkin, Ma'am.</i>

639
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:40,310
- Yes?
<i>- Some new results from the FSNI.</i>

640
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:42,489
Tell me.

641
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:44,639
<i>They've managed to type
mitochondrial DNA</i>

642
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,099
<i>from the degraded blood sample</i>

643
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,890
<i>found on the scissors
that ties them to the crime scene.</i>

644
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:51,200
<i>It's Joe Brawley's blood.</i>

645
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:57,200
He's entitled to eight hours
uninterrupted rest, ma'am.

646
00:53:57,930 --> 00:53:59,459
If we wake him,

647
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:02,600
I have to reset the clock
and you lose two hours.

648
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:09,970
Fetch the gaoler.

649
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:30,100
Yes, Ma'am?

650
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,050
May I?

651
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:48,270
There's something I'd like you to do.

652
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:12,560
I'm DC Gail McNally.

653
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:16,629
Paul Spector, I am further
arresting you for the murder

654
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:20,089
of Joseph Brawley and the
attempted murder of Anne Brawley.

655
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:21,889
You do not have to say anything,

656
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:24,059
but it may harm your
defence if you do not mention

657
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,850
when questioned something
you later rely on in court.

658
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:30,890
Anything you do say may
be given in evidence.

659
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:33,350
Do you understand?

660
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:34,830

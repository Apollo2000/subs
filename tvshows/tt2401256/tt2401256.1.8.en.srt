2
00:01:29,854 --> 00:01:32,988
So the writer tells me the main
character of the show is a cop

3
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,091
who gets his legs blown off
in Afghanistan, comes back,

4
00:01:36,227 --> 00:01:38,594
gets fitted for those
carbon-compound kangaroo feet...

5
00:01:38,696 --> 00:01:41,730
Like that Olympics guy who shot
his girlfriend in the can...

6
00:01:41,832 --> 00:01:43,265
And gets back on the job.

7
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:46,235
So, like what? Goes
bouncing around after the bad guys?

8
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:48,037
Apparently that's the whole point.

9
00:01:48,139 --> 00:01:49,405
RoboDouche.

10
00:01:49,507 --> 00:01:51,418
I told him, "Hey, you want
to do something original?

11
00:01:51,442 --> 00:01:55,244
How about a series with a cop
who doesn't give a shit?"

12
00:01:55,346 --> 00:01:56,912
Punches out, comes home,

13
00:01:57,014 --> 00:01:58,881
has dinner with his family,
bangs the wife,

14
00:01:58,983 --> 00:02:00,749
and sleeps like a log.

15
00:02:00,851 --> 00:02:02,751
You write a show like that,

16
00:02:02,853 --> 00:02:04,687
and the job will throw you a parade.

17
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:06,155
Am I right, Dennis?

18
00:02:50,935 --> 00:02:53,369
What the fuck you still doing here?

19
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:55,471
What, do we gotta have
another party for you?

20
00:02:55,573 --> 00:02:58,540
Picking up some last things.

21
00:03:05,216 --> 00:03:07,549
Go home. Hit the links.

22
00:03:08,619 --> 00:03:10,285
Get the hell out of here.

23
00:04:06,644 --> 00:04:08,343
This is nice.

24
00:04:08,446 --> 00:04:09,778
Yeah, it's okay.

25
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,914
The night of October 24th,

26
00:04:12,016 --> 00:04:14,249
did you encounter
the defendant and Andrea

27
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:16,218
on West 87th Street?

28
00:04:18,122 --> 00:04:20,022
I don't think I want to
answer that question.

29
00:04:20,124 --> 00:04:21,924
You kind of have to, Mr. Williams.

30
00:04:22,026 --> 00:04:24,827
Not true, not true. It's called
the Fifth Amendment.

31
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:27,863
You're concerned
about self-incrimination?

32
00:04:27,965 --> 00:04:29,565
What for? I ain't do nothing.

33
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:32,601
Then do us all a favor
and answer the question.

34
00:04:32,703 --> 00:04:34,069
I don't think you right on that.

35
00:04:34,171 --> 00:04:36,805
But... I mean, no disrespect...

36
00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:38,073
But, yes.

37
00:04:38,175 --> 00:04:39,708
Tell her.

38
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,243
Yeah, I saw them.

39
00:04:41,345 --> 00:04:42,744
Were you alone?

40
00:04:44,748 --> 00:04:45,814
No.

41
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,317
Why did you tell the detective you were?

42
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,986
I misremembered.

43
00:04:51,088 --> 00:04:52,921
You misremembered, that's why?

44
00:04:53,023 --> 00:04:55,557
Not because you were afraid
of this person you were with?

45
00:04:57,495 --> 00:04:58,694
Is the Fifth okay here?

46
00:04:58,796 --> 00:05:02,664
No. That train's left
the station, Mr. Williams.

47
00:05:04,435 --> 00:05:06,235
No. I'm not afraid of him.

48
00:05:06,337 --> 00:05:07,369
Him?

49
00:05:07,471 --> 00:05:08,739
Duane, dude's name is.

50
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,939
Duane Reade.

51
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,841
Yeah. And is that a curse or what?

52
00:05:12,943 --> 00:05:14,376
Bacon come to snatch your ass up,

53
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:15,989
talking 'bout "What's your name, nigga?"

54
00:05:16,013 --> 00:05:17,312
You like, "Duane Reade."

55
00:05:17,414 --> 00:05:19,292
And they like, "Oh, you
trying to be funny, motherfucker?"

56
00:05:19,316 --> 00:05:23,385
Blam, blam, blam! "Once
again, what's your fucking name?"

57
00:05:26,156 --> 00:05:27,422
Right?

58
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:30,992
Thank you, Mr. Williams.

59
00:05:31,095 --> 00:05:32,127
You got it.

60
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:33,595
Mrs. Weiss?

61
00:05:33,697 --> 00:05:35,664
No questions, Your Honor.

62
00:05:37,568 --> 00:05:43,338
Mr. Duane Reade. Where
do you presently reside?

63
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,406
The Cave.

64
00:05:44,508 --> 00:05:46,741
Do you mean Cavendish
State Penitentiary?

65
00:05:46,844 --> 00:05:48,076
That's what I said.

66
00:05:48,178 --> 00:05:50,245
How is it you find yourself there?

67
00:05:50,347 --> 00:05:53,748
They say a burglary. I say trespassing.

68
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:55,083
I didn't leave with nothing.

69
00:05:55,185 --> 00:05:57,119
Isn't that because
the police apprehended you

70
00:05:57,221 --> 00:06:00,288
before you could get out the door with
the Fujitsu TV you were carrying?

71
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,857
That's what they say.

72
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:04,159
Was this your first arrest for burglary?

73
00:06:04,261 --> 00:06:05,760
I don't think so.

74
00:06:05,863 --> 00:06:07,395
I don't either.

75
00:06:07,498 --> 00:06:09,064
Because it was your 14th.

76
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:13,635
And you assaulted seven of these
14 homeowners with a knife.

77
00:06:13,737 --> 00:06:16,805
One Mr. Cuatro... Do you remember him?

78
00:06:16,907 --> 00:06:18,440
That was self-defense.

79
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:21,409
Dude come running up on me.
I had to fight for my life.

80
00:06:21,512 --> 00:06:25,213
Mr. Cuatro was 78 years old
and on an oxygen tank.

81
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:27,616
Did you bring the knife with you?

82
00:06:27,718 --> 00:06:29,851
No. Got it from his kitchen.

83
00:06:29,953 --> 00:06:32,554
A five-inch steak knife,
according to the police report.

84
00:06:32,656 --> 00:06:36,124
And you were arrested in the
same manner on September 20th, 2012,

85
00:06:36,226 --> 00:06:38,160
in possession of another steak knife.

86
00:06:38,262 --> 00:06:39,542
Did you bring that one with you?

87
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,364
Again, that was trespassing.

88
00:06:42,466 --> 00:06:44,199
It was aggravated sexual assault.

89
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:46,735
But my question is
where the knife came from.

90
00:06:46,837 --> 00:06:49,704
The lady's sink, I think.

91
00:06:49,806 --> 00:06:52,941
Like with Mr.
Cuatro and the others here,

92
00:06:53,043 --> 00:06:54,442
you used a knife that was there.

93
00:06:54,545 --> 00:06:57,145
That's your MO?

94
00:06:57,247 --> 00:07:01,183
A shrug won't do, Mr.
Reade. We need to hear an answer.

95
00:07:01,285 --> 00:07:03,218
Okay.

96
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,520
Yeah.

97
00:07:05,622 --> 00:07:08,356
Trevor Williams, you know him?

98
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,326
Yeah, I know him.

99
00:07:11,428 --> 00:07:13,395
He testified you didn't say anything

100
00:07:13,497 --> 00:07:15,530
when you encountered the
defendant and Ms. Cornish

101
00:07:15,632 --> 00:07:18,300
outside her residence with him.

102
00:07:18,402 --> 00:07:19,801
He said you just stood there...

103
00:07:19,903 --> 00:07:21,436
I'm going to Sharanda's, man.

104
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:25,340
...silent, watching them go inside.

105
00:07:25,442 --> 00:07:27,642
I know they got some
weed over there, too.

106
00:07:27,744 --> 00:07:30,779
What were you thinking about, I wonder?

107
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,192
Any questions, Mrs. Weiss?

108
00:07:44,294 --> 00:07:46,828
No questions, Your Honor.

109
00:07:53,136 --> 00:07:55,971
Why isn't she questioning these guys?

110
00:07:56,073 --> 00:07:59,774
To say to the jury she's
not concerned about them.

111
00:07:59,876 --> 00:08:01,409
But she is.

112
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,014
You're leaving me alone
with the undertaker?

113
00:08:06,116 --> 00:08:08,083
You'll be fine.

114
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,531
Psst!

115
00:08:37,381 --> 00:08:39,748
What's going on here, Mr. Day?

116
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:43,218
She threw a lit cigarette next to
the gas pump I was standing at.

117
00:08:43,353 --> 00:08:45,053
I put it out.

118
00:08:45,155 --> 00:08:47,055
Is that how people
usually put out cigarettes,

119
00:08:47,157 --> 00:08:48,590
on someone's car window?

120
00:08:48,692 --> 00:08:51,226
I know guys put it out in their mouth.

121
00:08:53,397 --> 00:08:55,563
Just before you put it out,
you knocked on the window,

122
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,399
like people do to say "Roll it down."

123
00:08:57,501 --> 00:08:59,501
And we saw that she didn't roll it down.

124
00:08:59,603 --> 00:09:01,770
Do you think she might
have been afraid of you?

125
00:09:01,872 --> 00:09:03,571
Oh, no one's afraid of me.

126
00:09:03,674 --> 00:09:07,442
I am. After what you said to
me at the mortuary, remember?

127
00:09:07,544 --> 00:09:09,644
Am I right, that's inadmissible?

128
00:09:09,746 --> 00:09:11,379
That's "heresy," right?

129
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:12,981
Something like that.

130
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:16,017
Disregard Ms. Kapoor's last statement.

131
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:19,587
This is an order of protection
issued against you by your wife, Michelle.

132
00:09:19,656 --> 00:09:22,123
Yeah, that's before
we got back together.

133
00:09:22,225 --> 00:09:23,425
Oh, that's good.

134
00:09:23,527 --> 00:09:25,887
I'm happy for you both, you
managed to resolve that somehow.

135
00:09:25,962 --> 00:09:28,530
What about this 911 call she made

136
00:09:28,632 --> 00:09:30,398
saying you were
threatening her with a knife?

137
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,334
The police come out,

138
00:09:32,436 --> 00:09:34,336
by then she'd
calmed down, that was that.

139
00:09:34,438 --> 00:09:36,805
This is one forgiving woman.

140
00:09:36,907 --> 00:09:38,707
I never did nothing to her.

141
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:40,208
To who?

142
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,677
Who we talking about, my wife.

143
00:09:45,716 --> 00:09:48,350
So, you're done filling
your hearse at this point,

144
00:09:48,452 --> 00:09:49,584
but you're not leaving.

145
00:09:49,686 --> 00:09:51,331
You're just... I
don't know what you're doing.

146
00:09:51,355 --> 00:09:53,054
Just waiting?

147
00:09:53,156 --> 00:09:55,423
Resting.

148
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,832
Now you're finally leaving
just as they do.

149
00:10:03,934 --> 00:10:05,500
Are you following them, Mr. Day?

150
00:10:05,602 --> 00:10:07,001
No.

151
00:10:07,104 --> 00:10:08,403
Where are you going, then?

152
00:10:08,505 --> 00:10:10,405
My whereabouts are my business.

153
00:10:10,507 --> 00:10:13,808
Oh, be a sport and answer the lady.

154
00:10:15,312 --> 00:10:16,611
Home.

155
00:10:16,713 --> 00:10:18,046
To Michelle?

156
00:10:18,148 --> 00:10:19,814
To my other residence.

157
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:23,284
An SRO hotel for men on 135th Street.

158
00:10:23,387 --> 00:10:24,597
Is there something wrong with that?

159
00:10:24,621 --> 00:10:26,654
No. It's just, if
you'd gone home to Michelle

160
00:10:26,757 --> 00:10:30,191
or a hotel with working security cameras,
unlike this rooming house,

161
00:10:30,293 --> 00:10:32,927
we'd be able to verify
where you went that night.

162
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:34,729
But we can't.

163
00:10:45,275 --> 00:10:47,809
She doesn't listen
to me, you know? I know.

164
00:10:50,614 --> 00:10:54,182
You look amazing, amazing.

165
00:11:05,996 --> 00:11:08,696
One. We're calling you as a witness.

166
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,565
So while you're up there,
you can explain

167
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:12,667
how you didn't kill your stepdaughter.

168
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:14,903
Two. I don't work out enough,

169
00:11:15,005 --> 00:11:17,372
so the next time you threaten my family,

170
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:20,809
it'll be one of my clients
who pays you a visit.

171
00:11:20,911 --> 00:11:23,445
He's from New Jersey.

172
00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:49,604
Arms out.

173
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,274
All right, go on.

174
00:11:54,678 --> 00:11:56,945
Arms out.

175
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:11,459
Please raise your right hand.

176
00:12:12,596 --> 00:12:15,797
Do you swear or affirm to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

177
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:17,398
and nothing but the truth?

178
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:18,766
Yeah.

179
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:23,071
My condolences, Mr. Taylor,
and my apologies,

180
00:12:23,173 --> 00:12:26,241
but there are certain things
only you can clarify for us.

181
00:12:27,677 --> 00:12:31,846
How would you describe your relationship
with your stepdaughter?

182
00:12:31,948 --> 00:12:34,082
Not great, to be honest.

183
00:12:34,184 --> 00:12:36,150
Honesty is why we're here.

184
00:12:36,253 --> 00:12:39,721
How come it wasn't great, if you know?

185
00:12:39,823 --> 00:12:41,990
The drugs mainly.

186
00:12:42,092 --> 00:12:45,460
Her drug use made our
relationship difficult.

187
00:12:45,562 --> 00:12:46,928
Hers with her mother.

188
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,364
Frankly, mine with her mother.

189
00:12:49,466 --> 00:12:53,701
An addict's net casts wide.

190
00:12:53,803 --> 00:12:57,605
Her mother, your wife, Evelyn,
died last year, I was sorry to learn.

191
00:12:57,707 --> 00:12:59,707
How long were you married?

192
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:00,842
Two years.

193
00:13:00,944 --> 00:13:03,177
And how did Andrea feel about it?

194
00:13:04,414 --> 00:13:07,181
Like a lot of kids feel
about second marriages.

195
00:13:07,284 --> 00:13:10,485
Seeing her mother happy...
I assume she was happy...

196
00:13:10,587 --> 00:13:12,587
Didn't make her daughter happy?

197
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:13,688
No.

198
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,290
Was the age difference an issue?

199
00:13:15,392 --> 00:13:17,625
What is it, about 20 years?

200
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:21,296
It didn't help. Andrea, I mean.

201
00:13:21,398 --> 00:13:24,098
It didn't matter at
all to Evelyn, or me.

202
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,600
Was there anything else about
the marriage Andrea didn't like

203
00:13:26,636 --> 00:13:29,470
before, during, or after it?

204
00:13:29,573 --> 00:13:30,838
Yeah.

205
00:13:30,941 --> 00:13:32,840
Evelyn's will.

206
00:13:34,578 --> 00:13:36,844
It entitled you to something
when Evelyn died

207
00:13:36,947 --> 00:13:39,547
even though you'd been
married just two years.

208
00:13:40,884 --> 00:13:41,716
Yeah.

209
00:13:41,818 --> 00:13:44,018
And Andrea was unhappy with that?

210
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,853
"Outraged" is the word.

211
00:13:45,956 --> 00:13:48,156
Outraged you were to get
half her mother's estate,

212
00:13:48,258 --> 00:13:50,425
which included the home on 87th Street,

213
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:53,595
which has a current market value
of about 10 million dollars.

214
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:56,230
That's right.

215
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,633
So outraged she filed an
appeal in a probate court

216
00:13:58,735 --> 00:14:02,036
in hopes it would agree
with her you deserved nothing.

217
00:14:04,774 --> 00:14:05,707
That's right.

218
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:08,343
Did that outrage you?

219
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:11,245
No. I understood why she felt like that.

220
00:14:11,348 --> 00:14:14,882
You understood it but
filed a countersuit against her.

221
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:17,085
Did that help diffuse her outrage?

222
00:14:18,955 --> 00:14:21,289
No. It didn't.

223
00:14:21,391 --> 00:14:23,858
How did two people like
this live under one roof?

224
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,026
They don't.

225
00:14:25,128 --> 00:14:26,894
She asked me to leave and I did.

226
00:14:26,997 --> 00:14:31,132
You moved out of her mother's
10 million-dollar house, to...?

227
00:14:31,234 --> 00:14:34,302
A fifth-floor walk-up in Queens.

228
00:14:34,404 --> 00:14:35,703
But you know what?

229
00:14:35,805 --> 00:14:38,139
Compared to being yelled at
by a 22-year-old drug addict

230
00:14:38,241 --> 00:14:42,076
day in and day out, it's paradise.

231
00:14:42,946 --> 00:14:44,379
Well, now all that drama is over,

232
00:14:44,481 --> 00:14:46,848
you can move back or sell it.

233
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,217
That's my intention.

234
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,320
What do you do for a living, Mr. Taylor?

235
00:14:52,422 --> 00:14:55,723
Personal trainer, at Atlantis Fitness.

236
00:14:55,825 --> 00:14:57,258
Is that where you met Evelyn?

237
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,395
No. I met her at prior health
club I was working at, Equinox.

238
00:15:00,497 --> 00:15:02,030
Why'd you leave Equinox for Atlantis?

239
00:15:02,132 --> 00:15:04,065
- Better pay?
- No.

240
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:06,401
Was it because of the
members at Equinox, women members,

241
00:15:06,503 --> 00:15:09,570
complained to the management about
unwanted attention from you?

242
00:15:10,974 --> 00:15:12,473
It wasn't true.

243
00:15:12,575 --> 00:15:14,442
But, yeah, a couple members said that.

244
00:15:14,544 --> 00:15:16,911
What do you make now at Atlantis?

245
00:15:19,382 --> 00:15:21,849
Look, it's obvious what you're saying,

246
00:15:21,951 --> 00:15:24,152
so why don't I just save
you all the cat and mouse,

247
00:15:24,254 --> 00:15:27,321
and these people, some
of their valuable time.

248
00:15:27,424 --> 00:15:30,158
I make about $35,000 a year there.

249
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,294
Plus whatever I can
pick up with private lessons.

250
00:15:33,396 --> 00:15:34,962
I'm on the verge of bankruptcy.

251
00:15:35,065 --> 00:15:38,032
I filed for bankruptcy twice before.

252
00:15:38,134 --> 00:15:42,070
And no, I didn't kill my stepdaughter.

253
00:15:42,172 --> 00:15:44,772
Ever been arrested?

254
00:15:44,874 --> 00:15:45,940
Yeah.

255
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:47,141
Twice, right?

256
00:15:47,243 --> 00:15:49,377
Both times for domestic battery?

257
00:15:51,047 --> 00:15:53,815
Once against your ex-wife Jean,

258
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:56,617
once against Andrea's mother.

259
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,420
Restraining orders in both cases.

260
00:15:59,522 --> 00:16:00,655
Yeah.

261
00:16:00,757 --> 00:16:03,558
Another of your entitlements
now is Andrea's trust fund,

262
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,827
which you filed for
in Surrogate's Court.

263
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:07,862
When did you file this claim?

264
00:16:08,898 --> 00:16:10,765
The date? I don't know.

265
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:13,301
Well, here it is, so let's have a look.

266
00:16:22,445 --> 00:16:24,412
October 27th.

267
00:16:26,082 --> 00:16:28,216
That's two days after her
murder, that Monday.

268
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:31,052
Of course, it's closed
on Saturday and Sunday.

269
00:16:31,154 --> 00:16:33,387
Is the time of filing on there?

270
00:16:34,824 --> 00:16:36,424
8:00 a.m.

271
00:16:36,526 --> 00:16:39,393
You know what time
Surrogate's Court opens?

272
00:16:39,496 --> 00:16:40,628
8:00 a.m.

273
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,530
Uh-huh.

274
00:16:42,632 --> 00:16:44,365
And when was Andrea's funeral?

275
00:16:45,635 --> 00:16:47,235
That Wednesday.

276
00:16:47,337 --> 00:16:49,003
So, two days before you buried her,

277
00:16:49,105 --> 00:16:51,539
you applied for her trust fund.

278
00:16:51,641 --> 00:16:53,841
Okay. I think I've got
the time line straight.

279
00:16:53,943 --> 00:16:55,977
Just one more question.

280
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,045
When Andrea asked you to move out,

281
00:16:58,148 --> 00:17:00,882
do you know if she changed
the locks after that?

282
00:17:02,051 --> 00:17:05,052
I don't, because I haven't
been back there.

283
00:17:06,055 --> 00:17:08,189
She didn't.

284
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:13,961
Mrs. Weiss?

285
00:17:14,964 --> 00:17:16,564
No questions.

286
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:44,225
Before this.

287
00:18:39,182 --> 00:18:41,916
I need the credit card receipts
from that night.

288
00:18:42,018 --> 00:18:45,686
Can't do it.
Customer's private information.

289
00:18:45,788 --> 00:18:47,421
Unless you brought a subpoena with you.

290
00:18:47,523 --> 00:18:49,323
I'm not talking about the cash purchases

291
00:18:49,425 --> 00:18:51,325
you have no intention of reporting,

292
00:18:51,427 --> 00:18:53,027
just the credit cards.

293
00:18:53,129 --> 00:18:55,062
Not without a subpoena.

294
00:18:55,164 --> 00:18:56,664
Sorry.

295
00:19:01,237 --> 00:19:02,637
This is my subpoena,

296
00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:04,972
only pretend it has a "C" on it.

297
00:19:33,002 --> 00:19:35,536
You should feel okay.

298
00:19:35,638 --> 00:19:38,472
- Do you?
- I do.

299
00:19:38,574 --> 00:19:41,342
Then you're a worse liar
than the stepfather.

300
00:19:41,444 --> 00:19:44,512
Any case, there's nothing else to do.

301
00:19:44,614 --> 00:19:46,347
We're out of witnesses.

302
00:19:46,449 --> 00:19:47,882
We're done.

303
00:19:49,852 --> 00:19:52,586
I want to call Naz.

304
00:19:55,325 --> 00:19:56,390
No, you don't.

305
00:19:56,492 --> 00:19:57,591
They need to hear from him.

306
00:19:57,694 --> 00:19:59,327
No, they don't.

307
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:02,496
They've got all the reasonable
doubt they need.

308
00:20:02,598 --> 00:20:03,664
I disagree.

309
00:20:03,766 --> 00:20:04,732
You disagree?

310
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:07,168
You don't know enough to disagree.

311
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,502
Who are you again?

312
00:20:08,604 --> 00:20:10,638
What's your experience? Remind me.

313
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,807
Who are you?

314
00:20:14,243 --> 00:20:15,409
Look...

315
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:18,012
when he walked into this
courtroom on day one,

316
00:20:18,114 --> 00:20:20,648
he was wearing the cloak
of presumed innocence.

317
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,517
He's still wearing it,
and will continue to

318
00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:25,820
unless he testifies,
then he takes it off.

319
00:20:25,922 --> 00:20:27,989
He forfeits it the minute
he goes up there.

320
00:20:28,091 --> 00:20:30,091
No, he doesn't. To the jury he does.

321
00:20:30,193 --> 00:20:31,692
He gets in that box,

322
00:20:31,794 --> 00:20:35,096
they'll expect him
to prove his innocence.

323
00:20:35,198 --> 00:20:38,366
Any everything else we've
presented goes out the window.

324
00:20:38,468 --> 00:20:40,401
You mean everything I've presented.

325
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:44,372
You're killing me, and that's fine,

326
00:20:44,474 --> 00:20:45,973
but don't kill him.

327
00:20:46,075 --> 00:20:48,909
Go home and write and
your closing argument.

328
00:20:52,949 --> 00:20:55,016
You think you can handle it?

329
00:20:55,985 --> 00:20:57,218
- Do you?
- I do.

330
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,487
And I think it's important.

331
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:02,390
Like, we'll lose if I don't?

332
00:21:02,492 --> 00:21:04,258
I'm afraid we might.

333
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,368
If I do it, I'm gonna need some help.

334
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,270
I'll walk you through the whole thing.

335
00:21:16,372 --> 00:21:18,205
But once I sit down and she stands up,

336
00:21:18,307 --> 00:21:19,473
there's not much I can do.

337
00:21:19,575 --> 00:21:22,009
That's not the kind of help I mean.

338
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:11,592
Hey, John. Hey.

339
00:22:11,694 --> 00:22:13,661
Sorry I didn't make it to your party.

340
00:22:13,763 --> 00:22:15,563
You mean my wake?

341
00:22:15,665 --> 00:22:17,031
What you should do

342
00:22:17,133 --> 00:22:19,133
is come work with me
in cardholder security.

343
00:22:19,235 --> 00:22:21,936
I swear, it's the best job I ever had.

344
00:22:23,072 --> 00:22:24,638
Listen, I need a favor.

345
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,542
I need the names and addresses
without a subpoena.

346
00:22:33,483 --> 00:22:34,815
No problem.

347
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:37,051
I'll start packing for prison right now.

348
00:22:37,153 --> 00:22:38,419
Thanks, John.

349
00:22:38,521 --> 00:22:39,587
Hey.

350
00:23:50,026 --> 00:23:53,360
Gate!

351
00:24:41,844 --> 00:24:43,410
Did you bring it?

352
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,046
You better say yes.

353
00:24:47,917 --> 00:24:49,350
You did it?

354
00:24:56,259 --> 00:24:57,925
It's okay.

355
00:25:21,717 --> 00:25:23,384
Where's the rest of it?

356
00:25:36,565 --> 00:25:37,931
I got you.

357
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,266
Okay?

358
00:26:14,303 --> 00:26:15,602
Officer.

359
00:26:49,372 --> 00:26:51,572
In the short time you
and Andrea were together,

360
00:26:51,674 --> 00:26:54,174
did you develop any
feelings towards her?

361
00:26:54,276 --> 00:26:55,409
I did.

362
00:26:55,511 --> 00:26:57,511
I liked her a lot.

363
00:26:57,613 --> 00:27:00,314
She was fun just to be with, um...

364
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:02,249
in a way a lot of my friends can't be

365
00:27:02,351 --> 00:27:03,684
that were raised conservatively.

366
00:27:03,786 --> 00:27:05,853
- As Muslims, you mean?
- Yes.

367
00:27:05,955 --> 00:27:07,788
Later that night when you found her,

368
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,556
can you describe that for us?

369
00:27:11,127 --> 00:27:12,793
I woke up in the kitchen,

370
00:27:12,895 --> 00:27:14,228
and walked up the stairs,

371
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,296
down the hall to the bedroom

372
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:18,732
to get dressed and say goodbye.

373
00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:22,069
She didn't say anything.

374
00:27:22,171 --> 00:27:24,204
So, I touched her to wake her.

375
00:27:24,306 --> 00:27:27,141
I felt in my hand something wet.

376
00:27:27,243 --> 00:27:29,343
I turned on the lamp next to the bed

377
00:27:29,445 --> 00:27:31,612
and saw her.

378
00:27:31,714 --> 00:27:33,981
The blood, the wounds,

379
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:35,849
and, uh...

380
00:27:37,486 --> 00:27:39,052
She was dead.

381
00:27:39,155 --> 00:27:40,320
Yeah.

382
00:27:41,724 --> 00:27:45,526
And you?

383
00:27:45,628 --> 00:27:48,829
I panicked and I ran.

384
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:50,364
I wish I hadn't done that.

385
00:27:50,466 --> 00:27:52,666
I'm ashamed that I did that.

386
00:27:54,637 --> 00:27:56,970
But I did.

387
00:27:57,072 --> 00:27:58,572
I was scared.

388
00:28:00,976 --> 00:28:03,644
Did you kill her?

389
00:28:03,746 --> 00:28:05,179
No.

390
00:28:06,148 --> 00:28:08,282
No. I couldn't have.

391
00:28:08,384 --> 00:28:11,018
Even if I was out of my mind,
I could never do that.

392
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,554
I know it in my heart.

393
00:28:16,459 --> 00:28:17,791
Thank you.

394
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:32,072
Mrs. Weiss?

395
00:28:50,793 --> 00:28:53,126
You ever lie, Mr. Khan?

396
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,296
I try not to.

397
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:01,001
Is taking things without
permission, like taxi cabs,

398
00:29:01,103 --> 00:29:02,536
a kind of lie?

399
00:29:02,638 --> 00:29:04,004
Yes.

400
00:29:04,106 --> 00:29:07,274
What about getting doctors
to prescribe amphetamines

401
00:29:07,376 --> 00:29:11,245
and then selling them at a whopping
profit to your friends?

402
00:29:11,347 --> 00:29:15,516
Ever tell your conservative
parents about that?

403
00:29:15,618 --> 00:29:18,285
No.

404
00:29:18,387 --> 00:29:21,421
When Andrea got in your cab,

405
00:29:21,524 --> 00:29:24,925
did you ask her to get out
like those other two guys?

406
00:29:25,027 --> 00:29:26,426
Uh, no.

407
00:29:27,796 --> 00:29:29,463
'Cause she was pretty?

408
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:32,366
I guess.

409
00:29:32,468 --> 00:29:33,400
Okay.

410
00:29:33,502 --> 00:29:35,168
So now she's in your cab,

411
00:29:35,271 --> 00:29:38,939
you're driving her around,
buying her beer.

412
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:41,608
You have any notions
where it might lead?

413
00:29:43,145 --> 00:29:44,611
Notions?

414
00:29:44,713 --> 00:29:45,846
Notions, thoughts.

415
00:29:45,948 --> 00:29:49,583
Like, with any luck
it might lead to sex.

416
00:29:49,685 --> 00:29:51,518
I don't really do that type of thing.

417
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,419
Which?

418
00:29:52,521 --> 00:29:55,022
Have sex with somebody I just met.

419
00:29:55,124 --> 00:29:58,358
Isn't that exactly what
you did three hours later?

420
00:30:00,963 --> 00:30:02,029
Yeah.

421
00:30:06,435 --> 00:30:09,636
What kind of sex did you guys have?

422
00:30:09,738 --> 00:30:12,806
If you're worried about
your parents hearing this,

423
00:30:12,908 --> 00:30:15,976
I'll give them a chance to leave.

424
00:30:20,015 --> 00:30:21,848
Just regular sex.

425
00:30:21,951 --> 00:30:24,518
I'm afraid we're gonna
need more than that.

426
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,787
Objection. No, we don't.

427
00:30:26,889 --> 00:30:28,388
Overruled.

428
00:30:31,327 --> 00:30:33,660
I don't remember the details.

429
00:30:33,762 --> 00:30:35,963
Is that because you have sex so often,

430
00:30:36,065 --> 00:30:39,299
it kind of just all blurs together?

431
00:30:39,401 --> 00:30:40,634
No.

432
00:30:40,736 --> 00:30:42,536
How many times have you had sex,

433
00:30:42,638 --> 00:30:44,338
with women or men?

434
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,608
Once before, with a girl.

435
00:30:49,578 --> 00:30:51,345
Only once before?

436
00:30:52,581 --> 00:30:55,816
And you don't remember anything
about this second time?

437
00:30:55,918 --> 00:30:57,718
There were a lot of drugs.

438
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:01,021
Oh, we've heard.

439
00:31:01,123 --> 00:31:03,423
A lot of foreplay, too?

440
00:31:07,396 --> 00:31:10,697
No. She didn't want a lot of that.

441
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,167
She didn't. Okay.

442
00:31:14,269 --> 00:31:15,936
How about you?

443
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:17,871
Is that how you like it?

444
00:31:17,973 --> 00:31:20,040
How would you like it?

445
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,709
Excuse me?

446
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:27,381
Having to sit up here in
front of all these people,

447
00:31:27,483 --> 00:31:29,916
answering this type of question?

448
00:31:31,253 --> 00:31:33,220
That's what you meant.

449
00:31:34,123 --> 00:31:35,656
Well, I wouldn't.

450
00:31:35,758 --> 00:31:38,058
But if I was on trial for murder

451
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,227
and freely chose to testify,

452
00:31:40,329 --> 00:31:43,497
I'd have to answer
the questions I'm asked.

453
00:31:46,502 --> 00:31:48,769
You know what,

454
00:31:48,871 --> 00:31:52,205
let's go to just after
not-much-foreplay sex.

455
00:31:52,307 --> 00:31:56,643
What you did between then and when you say
you woke up in the kitchen downstairs.

456
00:31:56,745 --> 00:31:59,012
I don't remember.

457
00:31:59,114 --> 00:32:03,150
This is a crucial
period of time, Mr. Khan.

458
00:32:03,252 --> 00:32:05,519
You might want to try
harder to remember,

459
00:32:05,621 --> 00:32:07,654
for your sake.

460
00:32:07,756 --> 00:32:09,756
I know, but I can't.

461
00:32:09,858 --> 00:32:10,924
Nothing?

462
00:32:11,026 --> 00:32:14,027
Not doing anything?
Not hearing anything?

463
00:32:14,129 --> 00:32:15,529
Not even going down there?

464
00:32:15,631 --> 00:32:16,930
Nothing.

465
00:32:17,032 --> 00:32:18,999
So, you woke up.

466
00:32:19,101 --> 00:32:20,934
You walk back upstairs.

467
00:32:21,036 --> 00:32:22,903
You found her dead.

468
00:32:23,005 --> 00:32:25,138
And you ran in a blind panic?

469
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,174
Yes.

470
00:32:27,276 --> 00:32:29,276
But then you ran back
and broke back into

471
00:32:29,378 --> 00:32:32,846
the same place you just ran
from in a blind panic.

472
00:32:32,948 --> 00:32:34,114
Remind me why?

473
00:32:34,216 --> 00:32:36,750
My car keys were in my jacket,
which was inside.

474
00:32:36,852 --> 00:32:38,418
Right.

475
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,288
So you grabbed your jacket
and ran out again.

476
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:43,090
Yes.

477
00:32:43,192 --> 00:32:44,691
Grab anything else?

478
00:32:44,793 --> 00:32:46,493
No.

479
00:32:46,595 --> 00:32:49,429
The vial of ketamine was
already in your jacket pocket?

480
00:32:49,531 --> 00:32:52,365
No, you're right. I picked
that up off the coffee table.

481
00:32:52,468 --> 00:32:57,070
This... This drug your...
your attorney says was Andrea's?

482
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,439
It was hers.

483
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:01,374
So why would you take it?

484
00:33:03,378 --> 00:33:04,745
I don't know.

485
00:33:04,847 --> 00:33:06,379
Take anything else?

486
00:33:06,482 --> 00:33:08,081
No.

487
00:33:08,183 --> 00:33:09,516
Think.

488
00:33:13,989 --> 00:33:15,455
No.

489
00:33:15,557 --> 00:33:18,925
So the murder weapon
was already in your pocket?

490
00:33:19,027 --> 00:33:20,994
Objection.

491
00:33:21,096 --> 00:33:22,062
Fine.

492
00:33:22,164 --> 00:33:24,765
So the knife was already in your pocket?

493
00:33:24,867 --> 00:33:27,334
No. I took that with me, too.

494
00:33:27,436 --> 00:33:29,002
Why?

495
00:33:30,906 --> 00:33:33,206
Because I knew how it looked.

496
00:33:33,308 --> 00:33:36,877
You were drunk, drugged, scared,

497
00:33:36,979 --> 00:33:39,045
and in a blind panic.

498
00:33:40,215 --> 00:33:43,016
But you still knew how it looked?

499
00:33:43,118 --> 00:33:44,151
Yeah.

500
00:33:44,253 --> 00:33:45,585
How did it look?

501
00:33:47,956 --> 00:33:49,523
Like I killed her.

502
00:33:55,597 --> 00:33:56,763
All right.

503
00:33:56,865 --> 00:34:00,000
So you left the house again
with the ketamine and the knife,

504
00:34:00,102 --> 00:34:01,668
got in your father's cab...

505
00:34:01,804 --> 00:34:05,572
We've heard what happened after that
from law enforcement officers...

506
00:34:05,674 --> 00:34:07,374
And now...

507
00:34:07,476 --> 00:34:09,075
you're in a patrol car,

508
00:34:09,178 --> 00:34:11,578
being taken to the precinct
by Officer Bell,

509
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,480
who thinks you're a witness,

510
00:34:13,582 --> 00:34:15,782
and you ask him what?

511
00:34:17,419 --> 00:34:19,886
Is she dead?

512
00:34:19,988 --> 00:34:21,321
Why did you ask him that?

513
00:34:21,423 --> 00:34:23,623
Because I hoped it wasn't true.

514
00:34:23,725 --> 00:34:28,528
Please read back the
testimony from "I turned on the lamp."

515
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:32,199
"I turned on the lamp next
to the bed and saw her.

516
00:34:32,301 --> 00:34:33,967
The blood, the wounds, and..."

517
00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:35,569
Ms. Kapoor, "She was dead."

518
00:34:35,671 --> 00:34:37,204
Mr. Khan, "Yeah."

519
00:34:37,306 --> 00:34:41,241
So, when you saw her just before
you ran in a blind panic,

520
00:34:41,343 --> 00:34:42,843
she was dead.

521
00:34:42,945 --> 00:34:45,579
And two hours later in the patrol car,

522
00:34:45,681 --> 00:34:47,280
you weren't sure?

523
00:34:48,417 --> 00:34:50,016
She looked like she was dead.

524
00:34:50,118 --> 00:34:52,185
But conceivably she wasn't?

525
00:34:52,287 --> 00:34:53,353
I don't know.

526
00:34:54,857 --> 00:34:56,256
You didn't check her pulse?

527
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:57,424
No.

528
00:34:57,526 --> 00:34:59,559
You didn't call 911?

529
00:34:59,661 --> 00:35:00,961
No.

530
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:05,799
Why not, if it was possible
she was still alive?

531
00:35:09,137 --> 00:35:11,104
I don't know. I wasn't thinking.

532
00:35:12,674 --> 00:35:15,375
You see why I'm
having some trouble here?

533
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:22,916
You had the presence of mind
to run from a crime scene,

534
00:35:23,018 --> 00:35:26,753
to remove evidence
implicating you in the crime,

535
00:35:26,855 --> 00:35:32,626
to operate a motor vehicle
without crashing into anything,

536
00:35:32,728 --> 00:35:34,594
but you didn't have the presence of mind

537
00:35:34,696 --> 00:35:37,898
to dial three numbers on your phone?

538
00:35:50,312 --> 00:35:55,982
The prophet Muhammad
has this to say about that.

539
00:35:56,084 --> 00:36:01,187
"Hurry with all the strength of your
legs to the one who needs help."

540
00:36:02,357 --> 00:36:05,025
Is that what you did for Andrea?

541
00:36:13,702 --> 00:36:15,869
Here's the deal, Mr. Khan,

542
00:36:15,971 --> 00:36:18,672
and you know it.

543
00:36:18,774 --> 00:36:21,308
Whether you stabbed her or not,

544
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:23,243
you could have saved her.

545
00:36:23,345 --> 00:36:26,046
This young woman who you barely knew,

546
00:36:26,148 --> 00:36:28,515
but who you say you liked...

547
00:36:36,692 --> 00:36:39,426
Did you kill her?

548
00:36:55,544 --> 00:36:57,410
I don't know.

549
00:37:06,121 --> 00:37:07,821
I'm done.

550
00:37:24,873 --> 00:37:26,339
Ms. Kapoor?

551
00:37:29,011 --> 00:37:30,944
Um...

552
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,414
The Defense rests, Your Honor.

553
00:37:51,733 --> 00:37:56,636
You know, at the
beginning, I thought we had maybe a...

554
00:37:56,738 --> 00:37:59,472
10% shot.

555
00:37:59,574 --> 00:38:02,042
Now?

556
00:38:02,144 --> 00:38:04,177
Zero.

557
00:38:08,817 --> 00:38:10,917
You just convicted him.

558
00:38:39,681 --> 00:38:41,014
No...

559
00:38:45,153 --> 00:38:47,253
I'm not discussing it.

560
00:38:59,201 --> 00:39:00,967
Jurors, I'll remind you

561
00:39:01,069 --> 00:39:03,403
not to discuss this case with anyone,

562
00:39:03,505 --> 00:39:07,907
and keep your TVs,
computers, and iPads off.

563
00:39:08,009 --> 00:39:11,010
Have a nice, electronics-free weekend.

564
00:39:11,113 --> 00:39:12,745
I'll see you on Monday.

565
00:41:27,816 --> 00:41:29,282
Hey, Mike.

566
00:41:29,384 --> 00:41:32,418
The shooting in the
strip club last Yom Kippur.

567
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,520
What was the vic's name again?

568
00:41:34,623 --> 00:41:36,522
Are you still here?

569
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:39,158
What the fuck?

570
00:41:40,562 --> 00:41:42,428
You don't remember?

571
00:43:23,431 --> 00:43:25,431
Red Label, rocks.

572
00:43:29,037 --> 00:43:30,169
How's it going?

573
00:43:32,407 --> 00:43:34,240
Good.

574
00:43:34,342 --> 00:43:35,842
Dennis.

575
00:43:35,944 --> 00:43:37,243
Ray.

576
00:43:37,345 --> 00:43:39,479
Nice to meet you. Yup.

577
00:43:39,581 --> 00:43:41,314
What do you do, Ray?

578
00:43:43,718 --> 00:43:45,084
Financial advisor.

579
00:43:45,186 --> 00:43:46,519
Ah.

580
00:43:46,621 --> 00:43:48,154
I play golf.

581
00:43:49,557 --> 00:43:51,958
Like, a golf pro?

582
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,360
Like retired.

583
00:43:54,462 --> 00:43:56,729
Used to drink Midleton,

584
00:43:56,831 --> 00:43:59,866
but for us pensioners,
it's rail scotch from now on.

585
00:43:59,968 --> 00:44:01,968
Good days are gone.

586
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:03,336
Excuse me.

587
00:44:03,438 --> 00:44:04,437
Hi. Check.

588
00:44:04,539 --> 00:44:07,039
You don't remember me. Huh?

589
00:44:07,142 --> 00:44:08,975
I was at the 2-1
the night you got shot.

590
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:10,777
I talked to you in the hospital.

591
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:13,112
Christ, what's that like?

592
00:44:13,214 --> 00:44:15,174
I mean, not getting shot.
I know what that's like.

593
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:17,784
But getting shot two
inches from your balls

594
00:44:17,886 --> 00:44:19,685
by some fucking pimp?

595
00:44:21,022 --> 00:44:22,288
It was nice meeting you.

596
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:24,602
I just told you, we met
before, on Yom Kippur, at the hospital.

597
00:44:24,626 --> 00:44:25,951
Yeah, I heard you. I don't care.

598
00:44:26,095 --> 00:44:26,959
Ray...

599
00:44:28,262 --> 00:44:29,295
Sit.

600
00:44:40,508 --> 00:44:41,841
What were you thinking then?

601
00:44:41,943 --> 00:44:43,442
'Cause I just don't get it.

602
00:44:43,544 --> 00:44:45,978
You think you can beat up
prostitutes like that?

603
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,547
And there's not gonna be
some kind of consequence?

604
00:44:48,649 --> 00:44:50,383
And keep doing it?

605
00:44:50,485 --> 00:44:53,119
Are you out of your mind?

606
00:44:53,221 --> 00:44:55,821
You are, aren't you?

607
00:44:55,923 --> 00:44:57,423
We got another connection.

608
00:44:57,525 --> 00:44:59,825
Friend of yours and my last job

609
00:44:59,927 --> 00:45:01,827
before this fucking retirement.

610
00:45:01,929 --> 00:45:03,295
Andrea.

611
00:45:04,932 --> 00:45:05,998
Tragic death.

612
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,600
Nice girl by all accounts.

613
00:45:07,702 --> 00:45:09,335
I mean, she had her personal problems,

614
00:45:09,437 --> 00:45:10,536
but who doesn't?

615
00:45:10,638 --> 00:45:11,971
You do.

616
00:45:12,073 --> 00:45:14,974
How much money do you
lose here every month?

617
00:45:17,979 --> 00:45:22,281
Is that what the fight was
about that night? Money?

618
00:45:22,383 --> 00:45:25,017
Withdrawals from her accounts?

619
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,887
Or are you gonna tell me
it was just a lover's quarrel?

620
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:31,457
She was a client, not a girlfriend.

621
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,460
I'm not sure which is worse for you,

622
00:45:34,562 --> 00:45:37,997
but I beg to differ.

623
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:41,500
So you went there later, after this.

624
00:45:41,602 --> 00:45:44,470
Woke her up, tried to talk to her again.

625
00:45:44,572 --> 00:45:46,305
Told her you'd get her money back...

626
00:45:46,407 --> 00:45:47,367
Of course, you couldn't.

627
00:45:47,442 --> 00:45:48,752
She told you to get the fuck out,

628
00:45:48,776 --> 00:45:50,521
maybe reached for the
phone to call the cops,

629
00:45:50,545 --> 00:45:53,312
you went downstairs, opened
the drawer, took a knife out...

630
00:45:53,414 --> 00:45:55,081
The killer's on trial.

631
00:45:55,183 --> 00:45:56,982
You guys arrested him.

632
00:45:57,085 --> 00:45:59,585
I'm not her boyfriend.
And now I'm leaving.

633
00:45:59,687 --> 00:46:03,522
Now you're just being stupid.

634
00:46:05,793 --> 00:46:07,860
It's better for you you were seeing her.

635
00:46:07,962 --> 00:46:11,430
That explains your semen in her bedroom.

636
00:46:11,532 --> 00:46:15,835
If you weren't her boyfriend,
then what the fuck, Ray?

637
00:46:15,937 --> 00:46:18,104
Don't be an idiot.

638
00:46:20,074 --> 00:46:21,507
I know you know what's next.

639
00:46:21,609 --> 00:46:23,843
If you weren't there,
then where were you?

640
00:46:25,113 --> 00:46:25,945
Home.

641
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,746
Everyone's at home eventually.

642
00:46:27,849 --> 00:46:29,949
Before that, say, around midnight.

643
00:46:31,452 --> 00:46:32,418
Here's the deal...

644
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,286
Here's the deal, talk to my lawyer.

645
00:46:34,388 --> 00:46:36,555
Oh, I will or rather,
the prosecutor will.

646
00:46:36,657 --> 00:46:37,890
But that's not the deal.

647
00:46:37,992 --> 00:46:39,625
The deal...

648
00:46:39,727 --> 00:46:42,495
is I know you weren't home.

649
00:46:42,597 --> 00:46:45,631
Fucking cell phones,
pinging all the time,

650
00:46:45,733 --> 00:46:47,833
even when you turn 'em off.

651
00:46:47,935 --> 00:46:49,435
And I will find the knife.

652
00:46:49,537 --> 00:46:50,903
We're done.

653
00:46:51,005 --> 00:46:52,471
No problem.

654
00:46:52,573 --> 00:46:54,607
Another Red Label.

655
00:46:59,347 --> 00:47:01,547
What, are you waiting for me
to cuff you or something?

656
00:47:01,649 --> 00:47:03,449
I told you, I'm retired.

657
00:47:03,551 --> 00:47:05,417
Get the fuck out of here.

658
00:47:14,061 --> 00:47:16,328
Forgot his hat.

659
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,937
Can I sit?

660
00:48:02,009 --> 00:48:03,142
What's your name?

661
00:48:03,244 --> 00:48:04,777
Terry.

662
00:48:04,879 --> 00:48:06,779
Naz.

663
00:48:10,017 --> 00:48:11,450
Who did that to you?

664
00:48:13,287 --> 00:48:14,486
I don't know.

665
00:48:15,523 --> 00:48:17,856
That's a good start, Terry.

666
00:48:17,959 --> 00:48:20,526
Let me guess, they told you
to tell your mom or whatever,

667
00:48:20,628 --> 00:48:22,394
to put money into
their commissary account

668
00:48:22,496 --> 00:48:24,363
and you said no.

669
00:48:26,901 --> 00:48:28,701
That's exactly what happened.

670
00:48:30,137 --> 00:48:31,837
You married?

671
00:48:36,978 --> 00:48:38,611
I gotta talk to a friend of mine first,

672
00:48:38,713 --> 00:48:40,879
but I can maybe get you
some protection in here.

673
00:48:42,783 --> 00:48:45,150
You don't gotta say yes or no now.

674
00:48:45,253 --> 00:48:47,653
Just putting it out there.

675
00:48:49,156 --> 00:48:50,589
Okay.

676
00:49:04,372 --> 00:49:05,838
He's married.

677
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:08,340
So he could swallow
his wife's dope hisself.

678
00:49:18,486 --> 00:49:21,987
She didn't exactly keep her financial
records neatly organized,

679
00:49:22,089 --> 00:49:23,522
but neither did we.

680
00:49:23,624 --> 00:49:27,259
Most of her bank statements were
still in their envelopes unopened,

681
00:49:27,361 --> 00:49:29,728
scattered around
with old "Vogue" magazines

682
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:31,063
and some junk mail,

683
00:49:31,165 --> 00:49:33,699
which CSU basically threw into a box.

684
00:49:34,702 --> 00:49:37,936
But this one she did open, September's.

685
00:49:41,342 --> 00:49:43,942
Three hundred thousand, gone.

686
00:49:47,815 --> 00:49:49,581
She could have loaned it to him.

687
00:49:49,684 --> 00:49:51,517
Or he could have just taken it.

688
00:49:51,619 --> 00:49:53,319
He had power of attorney.

689
00:49:53,421 --> 00:49:55,988
In any case, she knew.

690
00:49:57,558 --> 00:50:00,125
He said he went home after this,

691
00:50:00,227 --> 00:50:01,593
and he did,

692
00:50:01,696 --> 00:50:03,629
via the Midtown Tunnel,

693
00:50:03,731 --> 00:50:08,400
through a cash lane, even
though he's got an E-ZPass.

694
00:50:10,838 --> 00:50:13,539
Yeah. At 2:00 a.m.

695
00:50:13,641 --> 00:50:16,942
And here he is at 3:00 a.m.

696
00:50:41,936 --> 00:50:44,103
We've got more on the kid.

697
00:52:51,732 --> 00:52:53,532
Ladies and gentlemen,

698
00:52:53,634 --> 00:52:56,101
Mrs. Weiss has presented to us a case...

699
00:52:56,203 --> 00:52:59,538
Ladies and gentlemen, the Constitution
asks of you to review...

700
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,773
The Constitution asks of you

701
00:53:01,876 --> 00:53:03,842
to review the material

702
00:53:03,944 --> 00:53:05,444
in light of the evidence presented,

703
00:53:05,546 --> 00:53:06,866
and asks that we ask ourselves...

704
00:53:06,947 --> 00:53:09,748
What she did was unprofessional,
unethical,

705
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:11,650
and grounds for a mistrial,

706
00:53:11,752 --> 00:53:13,785
after which, the State asks itself

707
00:53:13,888 --> 00:53:15,687
"Do we really wanna go
through all this again

708
00:53:15,789 --> 00:53:20,125
knowing next time he'll have a
real attorney defending him?"

709
00:53:21,462 --> 00:53:22,327
You?

710
00:53:22,429 --> 00:53:24,696
No. Someone good.

711
00:53:24,798 --> 00:53:26,164
They'll be lining up.

712
00:53:28,669 --> 00:53:30,002
What would happen to her?

713
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:33,639
What do you care? You
like her like you liked Andrea?

714
00:53:33,741 --> 00:53:36,141
Take your hand off your dick.

715
00:53:39,547 --> 00:53:41,013
Are you high?

716
00:53:42,016 --> 00:53:43,649
No.

717
00:53:44,618 --> 00:53:46,685
What'll happen to her
is something between

718
00:53:46,787 --> 00:53:48,787
a reprimand and a disbarment.

719
00:53:48,889 --> 00:53:51,657
Probably, her career is over.

720
00:53:51,759 --> 00:53:56,128
But it's your life
we're talking about, so...

721
00:53:59,934 --> 00:54:04,469
Look, 20 years from now
when you wake up in your cell,

722
00:54:04,572 --> 00:54:06,605
and you look at yourself
in your dented tin mirror,

723
00:54:06,707 --> 00:54:08,674
here's what you're gonna see.

724
00:54:10,778 --> 00:54:12,778
Someone you don't recognize,

725
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,413
who made the wrong decision

726
00:54:14,515 --> 00:54:17,182
when he had the chance to save himself.

727
00:54:22,356 --> 00:54:24,923
Is that a yes?

728
00:54:31,865 --> 00:54:33,932
Okay. Good.

729
00:54:35,502 --> 00:54:38,070
Ah, I wish you hadn't done that.

730
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,907
Why, you don't like it?

731
00:54:42,009 --> 00:54:43,976
No.

732
00:54:44,078 --> 00:54:46,111
It's on the jury's side.

733
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:12,771
I really don't know
what to say, Ms. Kapoor.

734
00:55:12,873 --> 00:55:14,473
Do you?

735
00:55:14,575 --> 00:55:16,174
I made a terrible mistake.

736
00:55:16,276 --> 00:55:17,776
Mistake?

737
00:55:17,878 --> 00:55:19,211
Okay, let me ask you.

738
00:55:19,313 --> 00:55:22,614
What other careers did
you consider in college?

739
00:55:24,551 --> 00:55:27,686
Okay. This is what's going to happen.

740
00:55:27,788 --> 00:55:32,124
I'm going to turn this into the
ethics committee, obviously,

741
00:55:32,226 --> 00:55:33,492
then finish this trial.

742
00:55:33,594 --> 00:55:35,661
Ms. Kapoor, you are now second chair.

743
00:55:35,763 --> 00:55:38,764
John, you'll take over.

744
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,299
I can't do that.

745
00:55:41,402 --> 00:55:42,401
Sure, you can.

746
00:55:42,503 --> 00:55:45,003
There's nothing left
but closing arguments.

747
00:55:45,105 --> 00:55:46,972
The jury's barely seen me.

748
00:55:47,074 --> 00:55:50,008
All of a sudden, I'm there
giving the closing argument?

749
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:51,443
It'll be fine.

750
00:55:51,545 --> 00:55:53,245
Nah, nah, no, no.

751
00:55:53,347 --> 00:55:54,780
No. This is...

752
00:55:54,882 --> 00:55:57,049
clearly grounds for a mistrial.

753
00:55:57,151 --> 00:55:59,051
No. What this is,

754
00:55:59,153 --> 00:56:02,454
is an attempt to try
to force a mistrial.

755
00:56:02,556 --> 00:56:05,090
But you don't force
anything in my court.

756
00:56:06,326 --> 00:56:08,760
Well... I'll... I'll appeal.

757
00:56:08,862 --> 00:56:10,028
No law against it.

758
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:11,963
I'm serious. I heard you.

759
00:56:12,066 --> 00:56:14,199
Which won't be good for you.

760
00:56:16,203 --> 00:56:18,136
Excuse me?

761
00:56:23,043 --> 00:56:27,679
It'll be fine, John.
You'll do fine in there.

762
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:30,949
Bye now.

763
00:57:01,782 --> 00:57:03,048
It didn't work.

764
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:04,416
Sorry?

765
00:57:04,518 --> 00:57:07,285
That tape you dropped off at my door,

766
00:57:07,387 --> 00:57:09,421
there's no mistrial.

767
00:57:09,523 --> 00:57:11,690
Ten dumplings. Hold on.

768
00:57:11,792 --> 00:57:13,425
I'm not following.

769
00:57:13,527 --> 00:57:14,826
Sure you are.

770
00:57:14,928 --> 00:57:16,261
My question is why?

771
00:57:16,363 --> 00:57:20,098
I really don't know what
the fuck you're talking about.

772
00:57:22,002 --> 00:57:23,502
What'd you find, huh?

773
00:57:24,905 --> 00:57:27,405
You must be pretty sure about it.

774
00:57:31,512 --> 00:57:33,445
Who is it?

775
00:57:41,889 --> 00:57:43,388
Who did it?

776
00:57:51,698 --> 00:57:53,632
It may not be that bad.

777
00:57:53,734 --> 00:57:55,901
The circumstances,
the fact you're young,

778
00:57:56,003 --> 00:57:58,603
you know, that'll count for something.

779
00:58:05,846 --> 00:58:07,445
Thank you.

780
00:58:07,548 --> 00:58:08,613
For?

781
00:58:09,917 --> 00:58:11,416
For, um...

782
00:58:11,518 --> 00:58:14,820
I don't know, not lecturing me.

783
00:58:15,856 --> 00:58:18,023
I'm too busy to lecture.

784
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:20,826
Besides, you know what you did.

785
00:58:22,896 --> 00:58:26,464
So chin up, finish this trial...

786
00:58:28,001 --> 00:58:30,435
and then clear out your fucking desk.

787
00:58:48,622 --> 00:58:52,357
Ladies and gentlemen...

788
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:08,306
Oh...

789
00:59:12,346 --> 00:59:15,013
Ladies and gentlemen...

790
00:59:15,115 --> 00:59:19,517
when you file a request
for a document from the FBI

791
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:22,153
under the Freedom of Information Act,

792
00:59:22,256 --> 00:59:25,257
this is what you get.

793
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:27,959
It's called a redacted document,

794
00:59:28,061 --> 00:59:30,762
edited to render unreadable

795
00:59:30,864 --> 00:59:34,833
any content the FBI deems a
threat to national security,

796
00:59:34,935 --> 00:59:40,138
or, more often, to the security of
the workings of the FBI itself.

797
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:45,310
Redaction equals self-preservation.

798
00:59:45,412 --> 00:59:48,680
Like this, there is a redaction

799
00:59:48,782 --> 00:59:52,183
in the middle of what
the defendant has told you

800
00:59:52,286 --> 00:59:54,286
about the night of Andrea's murder,

801
00:59:54,388 --> 00:59:57,188
a black rectangle of nothing

802
00:59:57,291 --> 00:59:59,624
between the time he had sex with her,

803
00:59:59,726 --> 01:00:02,761
and when he, as he says,
found her bleeding out.

804
01:00:02,863 --> 01:00:05,830
He says he can't remember anything.

805
01:00:05,933 --> 01:00:09,067
He fell asleep. He passed out.

806
01:00:09,169 --> 01:00:13,805
He has redacted a crucial
period of time.

807
01:00:13,907 --> 01:00:18,476
Why? For the same reason
this is blacked out.

808
01:00:18,578 --> 01:00:21,079
Self-preservation.

809
01:00:26,219 --> 01:00:29,020
His defense team has tried to say

810
01:00:29,122 --> 01:00:32,357
there are other people
with motive, opportunity,

811
01:00:32,459 --> 01:00:35,327
and histories more consistent
than Mr. Khan's

812
01:00:35,429 --> 01:00:38,163
with such a horrendous crime as this.

813
01:00:38,265 --> 01:00:39,564
I'd ask why,

814
01:00:39,666 --> 01:00:41,399
but you know why.

815
01:00:41,501 --> 01:00:42,767
It's desperation.

816
01:00:42,869 --> 01:00:46,004
Because they know a redacted
story doesn't sit well

817
01:00:46,106 --> 01:00:49,507
with an intelligent jury.

818
01:00:49,609 --> 01:00:51,042
Is there any evidence

819
01:00:51,144 --> 01:00:54,479
any other person was
in the house that night?

820
01:00:54,581 --> 01:00:59,017
No. Nasir Khan was the
only person in the house

821
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:01,086
the night Andrea was murdered,

822
01:01:01,188 --> 01:01:04,889
in the bedroom she was murdered,
in the bed she was murdered.

823
01:01:04,992 --> 01:01:07,592
He's the only person
whose blood is there,

824
01:01:07,694 --> 01:01:10,695
whose prints are there,
whose semen is there.

825
01:01:10,797 --> 01:01:13,631
The only person who had
a knife in his pocket

826
01:01:13,734 --> 01:01:15,400
with her blood on it.

827
01:01:15,502 --> 01:01:18,970
He was that night, and to this day,

828
01:01:19,072 --> 01:01:22,073
the only suspect the police considered.

829
01:01:22,175 --> 01:01:24,009
Because...

830
01:01:36,823 --> 01:01:39,424
Because he was and is

831
01:01:39,526 --> 01:01:44,429
the only killer of this
beautiful, young woman.

832
01:02:05,585 --> 01:02:09,187
This is not a penknife
or a grapefruit knife.

833
01:02:09,289 --> 01:02:12,390
This knife is designed
to cut through meat,

834
01:02:12,492 --> 01:02:14,893
and that's what Mr. Khan used it for,

835
01:02:14,995 --> 01:02:19,697
cutting through tendons,
muscle, bone, and a heart,

836
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,900
22 times.

837
01:02:42,722 --> 01:02:44,022
Thank you.

838
01:02:51,198 --> 01:02:53,198
Ladies and gentlemen...

839
01:02:54,634 --> 01:02:56,568
Ladies and gentlemen...

840
01:02:56,670 --> 01:02:57,735
Ladies and gentlemen...

841
01:02:57,838 --> 01:03:00,738
Ladies and gentlemen,
in the rush to judgment...

842
01:03:00,841 --> 01:03:03,374
Okay, now. The rushed...

843
01:03:03,477 --> 01:03:04,709
There's two other guys.

844
01:03:04,811 --> 01:03:05,977
There's Duane Reade...

845
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:07,278
You can't deny that.

846
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:08,613
That's right.

847
01:03:10,517 --> 01:03:11,816
God!

848
01:03:11,918 --> 01:03:13,118
Right.

849
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:14,986
What the fuck?

850
01:03:15,088 --> 01:03:16,154
God!

851
01:03:16,256 --> 01:03:19,023
Fuck!

852
01:03:19,126 --> 01:03:20,425
God!

853
01:03:20,527 --> 01:03:24,796
Oh, no, hey, I need this
like a fucking hole in the head!

854
01:03:24,898 --> 01:03:25,997
Aah!

855
01:04:02,602 --> 01:04:03,535
Fuck!

856
01:04:12,312 --> 01:04:14,045
Fucking get...

857
01:04:19,819 --> 01:04:20,985
Fuck!

858
01:04:22,322 --> 01:04:24,756
God.

859
01:04:36,636 --> 01:04:38,870
You under any unusual stress?

860
01:04:38,972 --> 01:04:41,105
You could say that.

861
01:04:43,777 --> 01:04:44,943
Who gave you this?

862
01:04:45,045 --> 01:04:47,445
Some Chinese guy on Canal Street.

863
01:04:47,547 --> 01:04:49,013
Canal Street.

864
01:04:49,115 --> 01:04:51,783
Did he also offer to
re-tar your driveway?

865
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:57,088
Unless you like insomnia, panic attacks,
confusion, and psychosis,

866
01:04:57,190 --> 01:05:00,024
you don't want to
make a habit out of this.

867
01:05:00,126 --> 01:05:01,626
Oh...

868
01:05:17,744 --> 01:05:19,844
I'm gonna be honest with you.

869
01:05:21,414 --> 01:05:24,782
This isn't what I normally do.

870
01:05:24,884 --> 01:05:27,485
I mean, obviously,
someone who looks like this

871
01:05:27,587 --> 01:05:30,188
doesn't make his living
doing public speaking.

872
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:34,726
I'm sorry you even have to look at this.

873
01:05:37,831 --> 01:05:41,699
What I normally do is,
uh, plea my clients out,

874
01:05:41,801 --> 01:05:45,536
because 95% of the time, they did
what they were charged with.

875
01:05:45,639 --> 01:05:47,672
They sold that dope,

876
01:05:47,774 --> 01:05:49,173
they solicited that guy,

877
01:05:49,276 --> 01:05:50,408
they stole that iPhone.

878
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:52,410
It's clear to me just looking at them.

879
01:05:52,512 --> 01:05:54,178
So, I tell them, uh,

880
01:05:54,281 --> 01:05:57,382
"Don't be stupid, take the deal."

881
01:06:01,121 --> 01:06:05,556
The first time I saw Naz,
he was sitting alone

882
01:06:05,659 --> 01:06:08,993
in a holding cell at the 21st Precinct.

883
01:06:09,095 --> 01:06:10,962
He'd just been arrested.

884
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:15,600
I walked past him,

885
01:06:15,702 --> 01:06:20,271
out of the station and then stopped.

886
01:06:22,542 --> 01:06:26,611
I turned around and went back.

887
01:06:26,713 --> 01:06:28,846
Why?

888
01:06:28,948 --> 01:06:34,719
Because I didn't see what
I see in my other clients.

889
01:06:36,222 --> 01:06:38,656
And I still don't after all this time.

890
01:06:40,293 --> 01:06:43,628
What I see is what happens
when you put a kid in Rikers

891
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:48,566
and say, "Okay, now survive that

892
01:06:48,635 --> 01:06:52,136
"while we try you for something
you didn't do."

893
01:06:52,238 --> 01:06:55,506
And that's how you survive Rikers.

894
01:06:57,043 --> 01:07:02,013
Oh, there were crimes committed
that night, no doubt.

895
01:07:02,115 --> 01:07:03,581
Crime one,

896
01:07:03,683 --> 01:07:05,383
stood up by a friend with a car,

897
01:07:05,485 --> 01:07:08,553
a young man takes his father's
cab without permission

898
01:07:08,655 --> 01:07:11,155
to go to a party in Manhattan.

899
01:07:11,257 --> 01:07:17,161
Crime two, a young woman buys
some powerful illegal drugs.

900
01:07:17,263 --> 01:07:20,898
Crime three, on the banks
of the Hudson River,

901
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,834
under the George Washington Bridge,

902
01:07:22,936 --> 01:07:28,506
she gives him one of those
illegal drugs, MDMA.

903
01:07:28,608 --> 01:07:30,141
Crime four,

904
01:07:30,243 --> 01:07:31,843
later at her house,

905
01:07:31,945 --> 01:07:35,046
she gives him another
illegal drug, ketamine,

906
01:07:35,148 --> 01:07:36,647
which, with the Ecstasy,

907
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:40,318
and enough tequila to topple
a saguaro cactus,

908
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:44,989
knocks him out like the horses
vets give ketamine to.

909
01:07:45,091 --> 01:07:46,824
Crime five,

910
01:07:46,926 --> 01:07:49,160
upon discovering the body,

911
01:07:49,262 --> 01:07:52,463
instead of reporting it, he runs.

912
01:07:52,565 --> 01:07:56,968
Crime six, he makes
an illegal left turn.

913
01:07:57,070 --> 01:08:03,007
Crime seven, he resists arrest.

914
01:08:03,109 --> 01:08:08,179
Those are the crimes committed by
these two young people that night,

915
01:08:08,281 --> 01:08:11,115
and the only ones we have proof of.

916
01:08:11,217 --> 01:08:12,683
What we don't have proof of

917
01:08:12,786 --> 01:08:16,354
is who committed the crime
he's been charged with.

918
01:08:16,456 --> 01:08:21,025
The prosecution has presented
what it says is proof,

919
01:08:21,127 --> 01:08:23,528
but at the end of the day,

920
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:27,899
it's circumstance and speculation.

921
01:08:31,571 --> 01:08:35,339
The rush to judgment against Nasir Khan

922
01:08:35,442 --> 01:08:37,308
began at the 21st Precinct

923
01:08:37,410 --> 01:08:40,778
at 4:45 a.m. the night of,

924
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,080
and ended 10 seconds later

925
01:08:43,183 --> 01:08:45,082
when he was tackled to the floor.

926
01:08:45,185 --> 01:08:48,186
The police investigated no one else,

927
01:08:48,288 --> 01:08:52,790
not the stepfather who had a tempestuous
relationship with the victim,

928
01:08:52,892 --> 01:08:56,661
even though the percentage of
killers who know their victims

929
01:08:56,763 --> 01:09:00,531
is five times greater
than that of strangers,

930
01:09:00,667 --> 01:09:04,936
and even though among the
fraction of strangers who do commit murder.

931
01:09:05,038 --> 01:09:07,004
There were two individuals

932
01:09:07,106 --> 01:09:09,707
the couple had confrontations
with that night.

933
01:09:09,809 --> 01:09:11,809
One with a history of battery,

934
01:09:11,911 --> 01:09:14,946
the other with multiple convictions

935
01:09:15,048 --> 01:09:16,514
for aggravated assault,

936
01:09:16,616 --> 01:09:22,053
every time using a knife
from the victim's own home.

937
01:09:35,435 --> 01:09:39,904
The night Naz was arrested,
he lost a lot.

938
01:09:42,842 --> 01:09:44,809
He lost his freedom

939
01:09:44,911 --> 01:09:48,779
to return home to his
family, to his school,

940
01:09:48,882 --> 01:09:52,617
to his night job that helps
pay for that school.

941
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:57,889
But what he didn't lose,
and what none of us can lose,

942
01:09:57,991 --> 01:10:00,925
were his Constitutional rights

943
01:10:01,027 --> 01:10:02,860
to an attorney,

944
01:10:02,962 --> 01:10:06,197
to a fair and impartial trial by you,

945
01:10:06,299 --> 01:10:08,132
his peers,

946
01:10:08,234 --> 01:10:11,702
and to the presumption of his innocence

947
01:10:11,804 --> 01:10:15,006
beyond a reasonable doubt.

948
01:10:20,179 --> 01:10:22,113
We hear that term a lot.

949
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:25,516
But what does it really mean, huh?

950
01:10:25,618 --> 01:10:28,619
What's its definition?

951
01:10:31,291 --> 01:10:33,824
It doesn't have one.

952
01:10:33,927 --> 01:10:37,094
It's what we think,

953
01:10:37,196 --> 01:10:40,464
and as much as what we
think, what we feel.

954
01:10:42,302 --> 01:10:44,936
And what we feel

955
01:10:45,038 --> 01:10:47,705
and what you feel

956
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:49,206
will determine

957
01:10:49,309 --> 01:10:54,679
what happens to the rest
of this young man's life.

958
01:11:09,462 --> 01:11:10,761
Thank you.

959
01:11:24,177 --> 01:11:25,576
Thank you.

960
01:12:25,738 --> 01:12:27,471
Nothing.

961
01:12:29,008 --> 01:12:31,475
See you tomorrow.

962
01:12:54,934 --> 01:12:56,100
Okay.

963
01:12:56,202 --> 01:12:59,236
Oh, we got your Viagra now.

964
01:12:59,338 --> 01:13:01,238
I don't give a fuck anymore.

965
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:04,308
That's a good one.

966
01:13:04,410 --> 01:13:05,710
Want a receipt?

967
01:13:05,812 --> 01:13:06,911
Mm-mm.

968
01:13:57,830 --> 01:14:00,598
Worst comes to worst,
it's not so bad in here, is it?

969
01:14:02,034 --> 01:14:03,167
I mean...

970
01:14:03,269 --> 01:14:05,503
you got people that care
about you in here.

971
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:08,939
I care about you.

972
01:14:11,811 --> 01:14:13,110
Why?

973
01:14:14,213 --> 01:14:16,447
How many times I gotta tell you?

974
01:14:16,549 --> 01:14:18,149
I don't believe it.

975
01:14:20,453 --> 01:14:22,286
Man, these dudes in here,

976
01:14:22,388 --> 01:14:25,422
upstate, places I've been...

977
01:14:27,093 --> 01:14:30,795
I mean, whether they in here
for selling drugs or murder,

978
01:14:30,897 --> 01:14:34,632
they all got one thing in common.

979
01:14:34,734 --> 01:14:36,600
You ask them,

980
01:14:36,702 --> 01:14:39,970
every last one say they innocent.

981
01:14:40,072 --> 01:14:42,540
But they all got that stink about them,

982
01:14:42,642 --> 01:14:44,842
every moron to millionaire,

983
01:14:44,944 --> 01:14:48,212
that lying stink.

984
01:14:48,314 --> 01:14:49,980
But you?

985
01:14:52,752 --> 01:14:54,985
You smell like innocence.

986
01:15:03,029 --> 01:15:05,129
You the real deal, Naz.

987
01:15:06,232 --> 01:15:08,465
That makes you one of a kind.

988
01:15:08,568 --> 01:15:11,669
And the fact that you under my wing?

989
01:15:11,771 --> 01:15:15,973
It's like... like I got
something nobody else got.

990
01:15:17,977 --> 01:15:20,644
It's like...

991
01:15:20,746 --> 01:15:23,247
like I got a unicorn.

992
01:15:26,686 --> 01:15:28,853
So why would I not take care of you?

993
01:15:31,424 --> 01:15:34,592
What kind of a cold individual
do you think I am?

994
01:16:48,467 --> 01:16:49,767
All rise.

995
01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:05,950
How we doing?

996
01:17:08,487 --> 01:17:10,087
Not good.

997
01:17:11,791 --> 01:17:13,123
Well, I'm sorry to hear that,

998
01:17:13,225 --> 01:17:15,626
but I have to ask you to go back.

999
01:17:15,728 --> 01:17:18,028
Your Honor, we're not
getting anywhere in there.

1000
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:20,798
You're discussing things.

1001
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:23,534
You're having some
differences of opinion.

1002
01:17:23,636 --> 01:17:25,703
We're deadlocked.

1003
01:17:28,541 --> 01:17:31,375
No you're not. I don't like that word.

1004
01:17:31,477 --> 01:17:33,277
I'm not going to let you use it.

1005
01:17:33,379 --> 01:17:35,980
Someone's holding out. You keep talking.

1006
01:17:36,082 --> 01:17:37,081
Not gonna happen.

1007
01:17:37,183 --> 01:17:39,183
Sure it will. What's the count?

1008
01:17:39,285 --> 01:17:41,585
Six to six.

1009
01:17:43,622 --> 01:17:45,489
And it's not gonna change.

1010
01:17:46,926 --> 01:17:50,194
So, I'm sorry, Your Honor,

1011
01:17:50,296 --> 01:17:52,062
but we're done.

1012
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:03,140
Thank you for your service.

1013
01:18:03,242 --> 01:18:05,809
The jury is dismissed.

1014
01:18:15,388 --> 01:18:18,622
So, Mrs. Weiss, what's your pleasure?

1015
01:18:18,724 --> 01:18:21,525
Shall we impanel a new jury for retrial?

1016
01:18:21,627 --> 01:18:23,260
Say, next week?

1017
01:18:39,745 --> 01:18:41,011
No, Your Honor.

1018
01:18:41,113 --> 01:18:45,449
My office declines to prosecute further.

1019
01:18:48,721 --> 01:18:50,521
You're free.

1020
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:56,326
Free to go home.

1021
01:20:03,529 --> 01:20:06,196
As per usual, I see some old faces.

1022
01:20:08,167 --> 01:20:10,334
Glad you learned your lesson.

1023
01:20:10,436 --> 01:20:14,204
Now for the freshmen,
I'll keep it simple.

1024
01:20:14,306 --> 01:20:16,306
You get told to do something, you do it.

1025
01:20:16,408 --> 01:20:18,342
Gate! You lay a finger on any of us,

1026
01:20:18,444 --> 01:20:19,910
we break out the riot gear,

1027
01:20:20,012 --> 01:20:21,612
we put you in the fucking hospital,

1028
01:20:21,714 --> 01:20:23,313
and we add another charge.

1029
01:20:43,469 --> 01:20:45,102
Come on.

1030
01:21:01,487 --> 01:21:02,553
Come on.

1031
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:05,389
Come on.

1032
01:21:05,491 --> 01:21:07,291
Come on!

1033
01:21:15,201 --> 01:21:17,034
Your pay.

1034
01:21:17,136 --> 01:21:18,869
Metro Card, one ride.

1035
01:21:20,406 --> 01:21:21,605
Wait a second.

1036
01:21:22,608 --> 01:21:24,341
He left this for you.

1037
01:23:19,058 --> 01:23:21,858
NYU campus security.

1038
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:24,695
So, back in uniform.

1039
01:23:24,797 --> 01:23:25,962
Sort of.

1040
01:23:26,065 --> 01:23:29,132
You sure you wouldn't
rather slit your wrists?

1041
01:23:29,234 --> 01:23:31,168
It's a job.

1042
01:23:31,270 --> 01:23:34,304
I got a job for you.

1043
01:23:40,913 --> 01:23:43,480
Let's go get him.

1044
01:24:37,603 --> 01:24:39,002
It's hot.

1045
01:24:44,143 --> 01:24:46,576
Anything you want to do tonight?

1046
01:24:46,678 --> 01:24:48,712
Go out, see your friends?

1047
01:24:48,814 --> 01:24:50,614
You should. It's fine.

1048
01:24:50,716 --> 01:24:52,849
Nah, this is fine.

1049
01:24:55,187 --> 01:24:56,486
Okay.

1050
01:25:18,177 --> 01:25:22,045
I spent a lot of time sitting
on this bed when you were gone.

1051
01:25:26,018 --> 01:25:28,118
I'm so happy you're home.

1052
01:25:30,856 --> 01:25:32,722
You thought I killed her.

1053
01:25:33,759 --> 01:25:35,258
Never.

1054
01:25:41,033 --> 01:25:42,599
Okay, Mom.

1055
01:26:34,286 --> 01:26:38,688
So, right now at the 21st
Precinct, there's someone in the pen.

1056
01:26:38,790 --> 01:26:43,093
They'll take him down to
The Tombs, to court, to Rikers.

1057
01:26:43,195 --> 01:26:45,362
Meanwhile, there's
someone else in the pen.

1058
01:26:45,464 --> 01:26:49,499
Tomorrow someone else,
the next day someone else.

1059
01:26:49,601 --> 01:26:52,302
No one's even
thinking about you anymore.

1060
01:26:52,404 --> 01:26:55,272
Except everybody here.

1061
01:26:55,374 --> 01:26:57,374
So what?

1062
01:26:59,778 --> 01:27:03,046
People stare at me
every day like I got leprosy.

1063
01:27:03,148 --> 01:27:05,549
They don't want to be anywhere near me.

1064
01:27:05,651 --> 01:27:07,984
I repulse them.

1065
01:27:43,589 --> 01:27:46,890
See? You learned something in there.

1066
01:27:51,463 --> 01:27:54,364
Everyone's got a cross to bear, Naz.

1067
01:27:54,466 --> 01:27:56,166
Pardon the expression,

1068
01:27:57,436 --> 01:27:59,069
fuck 'em all.

1069
01:27:59,171 --> 01:28:01,605
Live your life.

1070
01:28:05,844 --> 01:28:09,045
Thank you for what you did for me.

1071
01:28:09,147 --> 01:28:11,448
Don't mention it.

1072
01:29:01,266 --> 01:29:03,500
Yo, you got that?

1073
01:29:03,602 --> 01:29:04,834
I got that.

1074
01:29:06,438 --> 01:29:07,470
All right.

1075
01:31:03,555 --> 01:31:05,021
Four days later,

1076
01:31:05,123 --> 01:31:07,791
the CSI team enters
Patty and JR's bedroom,

1077
01:31:07,893 --> 01:31:11,027
one of the last places Patty
was seen before she vanished.

1078
01:31:11,129 --> 01:31:15,532
They notice several stained indentations
in the linoleum floor

1079
01:31:15,634 --> 01:31:17,534
and begin their testing with luminol,

1080
01:31:17,636 --> 01:31:20,804
a chemical used to indicate
the possible presence of blood.

1081
01:31:27,946 --> 01:31:29,979
Yeah?

1082
01:31:33,451 --> 01:31:36,319
Let me stop you.
Whatever you did or you didn't do,

1083
01:31:36,421 --> 01:31:39,155
it's 250 bucks, cash only.

1084
01:31:39,257 --> 01:31:41,791
No credit cards or personal checks.

1085
01:31:44,963 --> 01:31:47,831
Okay. Sit tight, don't talk to anybody.

1086
01:31:47,933 --> 01:31:49,632
I'll be down there in a little while.

1087
01:31:50,802 --> 01:31:52,402
You're gonna be fine.

1088
01:31:59,611 --> 01:32:03,279
Beautiful animals suffer every day.

1089
01:32:07,519 --> 01:32:09,185
They live in squalor,

1090
01:32:09,287 --> 01:32:12,922
with no food, no shelter,

1091
01:32:13,024 --> 01:32:15,124
and no love.

1092
01:32:25,070 --> 01:32:27,070
These are the forgotten ones,

1093
01:32:27,172 --> 01:32:30,006
loving animals who are abused

1094
01:32:30,108 --> 01:32:31,875
and neglected,

1095
01:32:31,977 --> 01:32:35,812
suffering all alone and living in fear.

1096
01:32:35,914 --> 01:32:37,714
Please, don't forget them.

1097
01:32:37,816 --> 01:32:40,683
Reach out and tell that animal

1098
01:32:40,785 --> 01:32:42,852
you'll be there.

1099
01:32:42,954 --> 01:32:45,955
Go online or call now.

1100
01:32:46,057 --> 01:32:48,424
Give your monthly gift of support.

1101
01:32:48,526 --> 01:32:51,027
For only $18 a month,

1102
01:32:51,129 --> 01:32:54,297
this is your chance to pull in animals

1103
01:32:54,399 --> 01:32:56,165
from the depths of despair,

1104
01:32:56,268 --> 01:32:58,735
to save them from a life of pain,

1105
01:32:58,837 --> 01:33:00,370
provide them with the food...

1106
01:34:01,617 --> 01:34:07,233

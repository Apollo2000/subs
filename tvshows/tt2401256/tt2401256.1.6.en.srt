2
00:01:52,419 --> 00:01:55,620
High temperatures will remain
in the mid to upper 50s.

3
00:01:55,722 --> 00:01:58,289
Tuesday will be mostly
cloudy, windy, and mild,

4
00:01:58,391 --> 00:02:00,725
with scattered showers
and high temperatures...

5
00:02:13,173 --> 00:02:14,839
That's better, huh?

6
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:20,511
More violence in Jackson
Heights this morning,

7
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,713
this time against a Pakistani driver

8
00:02:22,816 --> 00:02:25,616
dragged from his car
and beaten with bricks.

9
00:02:25,718 --> 00:02:27,618
Police are calling it a hate crime,

10
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,621
adding they believe the
motivation for the attack

11
00:02:30,723 --> 00:02:32,356
is the Nasir Khan case.

12
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:37,128
Mr. Khan is on trial for the stabbing
murder of Andrea Cornish.

13
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:49,373
That's for you.

14
00:02:53,513 --> 00:02:55,513
The good one.

15
00:02:55,615 --> 00:02:56,948
Go ahead, take it.

16
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,382
You earned it.

17
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,386
Did a good thing.

18
00:03:09,095 --> 00:03:10,628
Call your family.

19
00:03:11,965 --> 00:03:13,231
Thank you.

20
00:03:15,869 --> 00:03:18,202
So, how they doing?

21
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,908
I mean, they don't complain or nothing,

22
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,877
but not good.

23
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:29,680
Nah, it's okay.

24
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,397
Family's everything.

25
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,824
Safar Khan.

26
00:04:50,597 --> 00:04:53,731
My experience is in retail sales.

27
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,299
I can see that.

28
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:59,303
Unfortunately, I don't have
anything like that at the moment. I...

29
00:05:02,342 --> 00:05:03,874
You're the mother of that...

30
00:05:03,977 --> 00:05:06,644
Yes. And it was why I was let go,

31
00:05:06,746 --> 00:05:08,346
the only reason.

32
00:05:11,317 --> 00:05:13,517
What jobs do you have available?

33
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:17,188
What are you willing to do?

34
00:05:25,732 --> 00:05:27,031
What in particular?

35
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:28,799
Facebook, if he's on it.

36
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:30,501
Who on Earth isn't?

37
00:05:30,603 --> 00:05:32,270
Me.

38
00:05:34,274 --> 00:05:36,674
You hear Bob Rooney's kid
just got his gold shield?

39
00:05:36,776 --> 00:05:39,644
Christ, how old was
he when he had him, 12?

40
00:05:39,746 --> 00:05:42,046
Kid's 28, Tommy. The math is good.

41
00:05:42,148 --> 00:05:44,815
Earlier, before this.

42
00:05:44,917 --> 00:05:47,118
Hey, Dennis, when's your big day?

43
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,586
Not soon enough.

44
00:05:48,688 --> 00:05:49,854
Yeah, I'll bet.

45
00:05:49,956 --> 00:05:52,056
What are you gonna do with
yourself, play golf?

46
00:05:52,158 --> 00:05:53,791
Uh-huh.

47
00:05:56,029 --> 00:05:58,095
"You're a lifesaver."

48
00:05:58,197 --> 00:06:00,865
"You're a friend indeed."

49
00:06:00,967 --> 00:06:02,533
"You dah man."

50
00:06:04,537 --> 00:06:07,038
"Owe you big time, bro."

51
00:06:08,141 --> 00:06:09,874
For what, I wonder?

52
00:06:11,577 --> 00:06:13,311
Amir...

53
00:06:22,088 --> 00:06:24,789
Yo, use your bike?

54
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:26,057
What?

55
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:27,491
Your cell, man.

56
00:06:27,593 --> 00:06:29,393
I need to make a call.

57
00:06:29,495 --> 00:06:30,928
What cell?

58
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:35,066
Stupid-ass motherfucker.

59
00:06:41,908 --> 00:06:43,808
What are you looking for?

60
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,876
How out of his mind he was.

61
00:06:45,978 --> 00:06:49,347
Well, this is some cocktail,
I'll tell you that.

62
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:51,415
Too high to know what he was doing?

63
00:06:51,517 --> 00:06:53,384
That depends on the individual.

64
00:06:53,486 --> 00:06:54,819
I've had patients this fucked up

65
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:57,621
who could fly 747s
through five time zones,

66
00:06:57,724 --> 00:06:59,644
others who couldn't lift
their head off the floor

67
00:06:59,692 --> 00:07:01,425
if their life depended on it.

68
00:07:01,527 --> 00:07:03,427
Which are you interested in?

69
00:07:04,397 --> 00:07:06,063
The aviators.

70
00:07:55,381 --> 00:07:57,681
Okay.

71
00:08:15,802 --> 00:08:18,469
Well, can you help me?

72
00:08:20,773 --> 00:08:22,006
Yes.

73
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:37,221
For feet, for sex.

74
00:08:37,323 --> 00:08:40,257
Mix water. $300.

75
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:41,592
Does it taste okay?

76
00:08:41,694 --> 00:08:43,027
No.

77
00:08:43,996 --> 00:08:45,196
Credit card okay?

78
00:08:45,298 --> 00:08:46,464
No.

79
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:06,951
Hey, yo.

80
00:09:07,053 --> 00:09:09,854
Dude asked you to use
that cell phone I gave you.

81
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,756
Why'd you say no?

82
00:09:12,859 --> 00:09:14,325
'Cause it's mine.

83
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:17,695
What?

84
00:09:17,797 --> 00:09:18,996
What?

85
00:09:19,098 --> 00:09:22,867
Think I was just trying to save
you a trip to the pay phone?

86
00:09:22,969 --> 00:09:24,568
It's a cash machine, dummy.

87
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,637
Ten dollars a minute.

88
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:27,872
Oh.

89
00:09:27,974 --> 00:09:29,406
"Oh."

90
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,944
I'm gonna make a proper
convict out of you yet.

91
00:12:04,397 --> 00:12:07,197
Hold the belly button up in the air.

92
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:08,999
Great. You can do it.

93
00:12:09,101 --> 00:12:12,870
Every minute you've got
to move to your best ability.

94
00:12:12,972 --> 00:12:14,338
Last one.

95
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,740
Take it down now. Stretch it out...

96
00:12:16,842 --> 00:12:18,042
Mr. Day?

97
00:12:21,013 --> 00:12:23,113
Hi. My name's Chandra.

98
00:12:23,215 --> 00:12:25,582
I was wondering if I could
talk to you for a minute?

99
00:12:28,854 --> 00:12:31,121
Nah, I don't have a minute.
I got work to do.

100
00:12:33,325 --> 00:12:34,591
I'm not here to cause trouble.

101
00:12:34,694 --> 00:12:36,460
I just need some information.

102
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:43,400
Is there somewhere else we could talk?

103
00:12:49,308 --> 00:12:52,042
She the one got killed in the papers.

104
00:12:52,144 --> 00:12:55,312
She's the one you saw
the night she got killed.

105
00:12:58,384 --> 00:13:00,084
At the gas station.

106
00:13:03,456 --> 00:13:05,255
There's a security tape.

107
00:13:10,196 --> 00:13:11,962
What was going on there?

108
00:13:12,932 --> 00:13:14,498
You know.

109
00:13:15,968 --> 00:13:17,301
I don't.

110
00:13:18,304 --> 00:13:22,940
She had that vibration some women got.

111
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:26,577
Next thing you know, they're dead.

112
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:28,145
Like that.

113
00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:31,782
Vibration?

114
00:13:32,852 --> 00:13:36,420
Like she the cat, and you the yarn.

115
00:13:39,358 --> 00:13:41,992
Women like that out to destroy you.

116
00:13:42,094 --> 00:13:45,496
Sometimes you got no choice but to strike
first. You know what I'm saying?

117
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,435
Like, uh, she deserved it?

118
00:13:52,772 --> 00:13:54,705
Like it's a given with women like that

119
00:13:54,807 --> 00:13:56,807
to think they're God's gift,

120
00:13:56,909 --> 00:13:58,976
and you ain't nothing but a plaything...

121
00:14:00,012 --> 00:14:02,813
until they find out
otherwise, like she did.

122
00:14:11,924 --> 00:14:14,725
You talked to her there, why?

123
00:14:16,362 --> 00:14:18,695
Because I saw her for
the destroyer that she was

124
00:14:18,798 --> 00:14:20,731
and I did not like that.

125
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,534
Sometimes when you call
them out, they get neutralized.

126
00:14:30,943 --> 00:14:33,710
Do you remember the man she was with?

127
00:14:34,947 --> 00:14:38,749
That wasn't no man,
that was a ball of yarn.

128
00:14:42,955 --> 00:14:45,155
Where did you go after that?

129
00:14:55,901 --> 00:14:58,402
Where'd I go?

130
00:14:58,504 --> 00:15:00,003
Really?

131
00:15:00,105 --> 00:15:01,905
That's where you wanna go?

132
00:15:04,109 --> 00:15:05,742
- You a cat, too?
- No.

133
00:15:05,845 --> 00:15:07,477
You think I'm a ball of yarn?

134
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,745
No.

135
00:15:08,848 --> 00:15:11,682
I've dealt with females
like you my whole life

136
00:15:11,784 --> 00:15:13,150
and I'm still here.

137
00:15:13,252 --> 00:15:15,419
You know how?

138
00:15:15,521 --> 00:15:17,187
Read your Bible.

139
00:15:20,526 --> 00:15:23,093
Judges 16.

140
00:15:23,195 --> 00:15:25,762
That's all a man need to know.

141
00:16:47,346 --> 00:16:49,513
Oh, God.

142
00:16:59,325 --> 00:17:02,225
I'm not interested in
being saved, thank you.

143
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,566
What's wrong?

144
00:17:12,371 --> 00:17:15,405
"The Lords of the Philistines
came to her with silver.

145
00:17:15,507 --> 00:17:17,908
And after putting him
to sleep in her lap,

146
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,178
she called for someone to
shave off his seven braids.

147
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,048
And so his strength left him.

148
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,050
And she said to him,

149
00:17:27,152 --> 00:17:29,953
The Philistines be upon thee, Samson.'

150
00:17:30,055 --> 00:17:31,955
And they bound him in shackles,

151
00:17:32,057 --> 00:17:35,959
brought him to Gaza
and gouged out his eyes."

152
00:17:36,061 --> 00:17:38,061
That's what he thinks of women.

153
00:17:38,163 --> 00:17:40,430
And he followed them in his hearse.

154
00:17:40,532 --> 00:17:41,798
You don't know that.

155
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,102
He waited for them to
leave. There's no other reason.

156
00:17:46,739 --> 00:17:49,606
And the cops haven't even
bothered talking to him.

157
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,508
But you did.

158
00:17:53,512 --> 00:17:55,712
His eyes...

159
00:17:55,814 --> 00:17:58,915
Everything about him is so creepy.

160
00:17:59,018 --> 00:18:02,953
Next time, when you
want to talk to somebody,

161
00:18:03,055 --> 00:18:04,988
let me do it.

162
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,923
You want a drink?

163
00:18:07,026 --> 00:18:08,859
Oh, forgot, no alcohol.

164
00:18:08,961 --> 00:18:11,728
That's Muslims. I'll drink anything.

165
00:18:13,032 --> 00:18:17,534
Next time, leave the
Nancy Drew work to me.

166
00:18:18,837 --> 00:18:20,771
He's really scary, John.

167
00:18:23,042 --> 00:18:24,975
And I gave him my card.

168
00:18:50,936 --> 00:18:54,204
Chasen High School,
that's in the Bronx, right?

169
00:18:54,306 --> 00:18:56,073
Yeah, off Fordham Road.

170
00:18:56,175 --> 00:19:00,811
Great basketball team,
lousy metal detectors.

171
00:19:00,913 --> 00:19:02,834
So why would a kid transfer out of a

172
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:05,039
school half-a-dozen
blocks from his house

173
00:19:05,117 --> 00:19:07,784
to another one 40 minutes
away by subway?

174
00:19:07,886 --> 00:19:09,886
To Chasen?

175
00:19:09,988 --> 00:19:13,523
Well, not for the
robotics club, I'll tell you that.

176
00:19:14,893 --> 00:19:17,127
Probably didn't have a choice.

177
00:19:40,352 --> 00:19:44,654
His name was Nasir
Khan. Maybe you remember him.

178
00:19:44,756 --> 00:19:47,224
Yeah. I remember him well.

179
00:19:47,326 --> 00:19:50,660
He made the basketball team,
but I didn't play him too much.

180
00:19:50,762 --> 00:19:53,096
He left in the middle
of the ninth grade.

181
00:19:53,198 --> 00:19:55,465
Yeah, he got into a fight
with another kid.

182
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:57,868
Wound up throwing him
down a flight of stairs.

183
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,069
Broke his arm.

184
00:19:59,171 --> 00:20:01,838
But it could have just
as easily been his skull.

185
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,906
No kidding.

186
00:20:03,008 --> 00:20:04,674
They suspended him
for a couple of weeks,

187
00:20:04,776 --> 00:20:06,977
but when he came back,
it was just as bad,

188
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,912
so he was transferred out.

189
00:20:13,685 --> 00:20:15,552
Thanks. I appreciate your time.

190
00:20:15,654 --> 00:20:17,053
You're welcome.

191
00:20:25,831 --> 00:20:27,697
Thanks, Greer.

192
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:30,400
Jury selection isn't about selection.

193
00:20:30,502 --> 00:20:34,004
It's about getting rid
of your nightmares.

194
00:20:34,106 --> 00:20:36,106
Anyone from law enforcement.

195
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,441
Anyone from a law enforcement family.

196
00:20:38,544 --> 00:20:40,777
Anyone from a military family.

197
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:42,746
No small business owners.

198
00:20:42,848 --> 00:20:44,481
No working-class whites.

199
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,250
No elderly blacks.
They're tired of getting mugged.

200
00:20:47,352 --> 00:20:50,954
No one who knows anyone killed on 9/11.

201
00:20:51,056 --> 00:20:53,023
No one who listens to Fox News.

202
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,458
No golfers, no bowlers, no sailors,

203
00:20:55,561 --> 00:20:58,061
and absolutely no lawyers.

204
00:21:00,165 --> 00:21:01,464
Are you listening to me?

205
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,667
Yeah. Can I get another of these?

206
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:04,801
Yup.

207
00:21:15,547 --> 00:21:17,380
I broke up with my boyfriend.

208
00:21:17,482 --> 00:21:19,382
Oh.

209
00:21:22,387 --> 00:21:24,988
Fuck that. Who cares? This is important.

210
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,490
Educated liberals are good,

211
00:21:27,593 --> 00:21:29,926
unless they got a kid
died of an overdose.

212
00:21:30,028 --> 00:21:32,462
Jews, but not religious ones.

213
00:21:32,564 --> 00:21:34,898
Well, for this case it's complicated.

214
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,999
Same with Muslims.

215
00:21:36,101 --> 00:21:37,701
Still, they tend to be...

216
00:21:37,803 --> 00:21:39,502
I don't know. Who
the hell knows anymore.

217
00:21:39,605 --> 00:21:40,937
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

218
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,006
You know who you really want?

219
00:21:43,108 --> 00:21:45,408
The prize of all prizes...

220
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:48,044
Young, urban women.

221
00:21:48,146 --> 00:21:51,615
Mmm. Because they don't give a shit
about anyone's opinion but their own.

222
00:21:51,717 --> 00:21:54,084
And odds are one of them's
gonna be on our side,

223
00:21:54,186 --> 00:21:55,652
just by accident.

224
00:21:55,754 --> 00:21:58,321
And all we need is one.

225
00:21:59,324 --> 00:22:01,891
Young, urban women. Well phrased.

226
00:22:01,994 --> 00:22:03,860
I try.

227
00:22:20,312 --> 00:22:22,612
Look, I get it.

228
00:22:22,714 --> 00:22:26,049
Love is passion, it's fleeting,

229
00:22:26,151 --> 00:22:27,617
it's trouble.

230
00:22:29,454 --> 00:22:32,689
"Paradise by the Dashboard Lights."

231
00:22:33,892 --> 00:22:35,125
What?

232
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:39,162
You screw up, you break up,

233
00:22:39,264 --> 00:22:41,331
you get divorced. I did.

234
00:22:42,701 --> 00:22:44,868
It's not the end of the world.

235
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,541
You're alone.

236
00:22:54,446 --> 00:22:57,580
Well, so are you, now.

237
00:23:08,593 --> 00:23:10,760
Can I get another of these?

238
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,196
Greer.

239
00:23:14,499 --> 00:23:16,032
She's done.

240
00:23:19,905 --> 00:23:22,005
Why no sailors?

241
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:26,576
While one officer leads
Marilyn out of the bedroom,

242
00:23:26,678 --> 00:23:28,945
the other continues the luminol testing.

243
00:23:29,047 --> 00:23:31,047
What he finds could be proof

244
00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:33,316
that something violent happened there.

245
00:23:33,418 --> 00:23:36,086
There are visible positive results...

246
00:23:36,188 --> 00:23:37,287
Yo, it's Gooden.

247
00:23:37,389 --> 00:23:39,155
Can't come to the phone right now.

248
00:23:39,257 --> 00:23:40,690
You can leave a message.

249
00:23:42,527 --> 00:23:44,928
Hey, Gooden, it's Dad again.

250
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,229
What are you doing?

251
00:23:46,331 --> 00:23:49,566
You wanna come over? We
could stay in, watch TV,

252
00:23:49,668 --> 00:23:52,836
go out to Dinosaur Bar-B-Que
whatever you want.

253
00:23:52,938 --> 00:23:54,804
What do you say?

254
00:23:54,906 --> 00:23:56,973
Call me.

255
00:23:57,075 --> 00:23:58,575
I love you.

256
00:23:58,677 --> 00:24:00,955
...to help you search for any
kind of biological evidence.

257
00:24:00,979 --> 00:24:04,247
Then, according to police,
further disruptions...

258
00:24:22,367 --> 00:24:24,567
Your presence here today
makes it possible

259
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:26,469
for the court to select a jury

260
00:24:26,571 --> 00:24:29,706
from a representative sample
of our community.

261
00:24:29,808 --> 00:24:32,342
If it wasn't for people like you,

262
00:24:32,444 --> 00:24:34,310
we would not be able to make real

263
00:24:34,413 --> 00:24:36,246
the Constitution's guarantee

264
00:24:36,348 --> 00:24:38,648
of the right to trial by jury.

265
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,817
This right is included
in our Bill of Rights,

266
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:43,386
and guaranteed by the sixth
and seventh amendments

267
00:24:43,488 --> 00:24:45,288
to the United States Constitution.

268
00:24:49,761 --> 00:24:50,894
Yo, Marcus.

269
00:24:50,996 --> 00:24:52,195
Quי pasa, jefe?

270
00:24:53,331 --> 00:24:55,799
Did your boy tell you about Steven Diaz?

271
00:24:55,901 --> 00:24:57,033
Who?

272
00:24:57,135 --> 00:24:59,235
Schoolmate at Flushing High.

273
00:24:59,337 --> 00:25:02,272
Threw him down a flight of stairs.

274
00:25:02,374 --> 00:25:03,940
Almost killed him.

275
00:25:20,025 --> 00:25:21,291
Stick 'em up.

276
00:25:21,393 --> 00:25:22,525
Mmm.

277
00:25:24,262 --> 00:25:25,128
What's that?

278
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,197
Board of Education incident report

279
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:29,299
for violent behavior.

280
00:25:30,435 --> 00:25:32,001
Our golden boy.

281
00:25:33,939 --> 00:25:36,005
He lied to us again.

282
00:25:46,351 --> 00:25:49,219
I was in fifth grade
when the towers came down.

283
00:25:49,321 --> 00:25:51,855
I didn't understand
why I was getting beat up,

284
00:25:51,957 --> 00:25:53,423
why my little brother was,

285
00:25:53,525 --> 00:25:56,926
why my dad got jumped in his cab twice.

286
00:25:58,797 --> 00:26:00,930
Pakistani kids, North African,

287
00:26:01,032 --> 00:26:03,466
any type of Muslim...
It was a slaughterhouse.

288
00:26:03,568 --> 00:26:06,402
You try to fight back,
it only made it worse.

289
00:26:10,008 --> 00:26:11,841
I didn't have a fight with Steve Diaz.

290
00:26:11,943 --> 00:26:13,776
I just shoved him down those stairs.

291
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,779
Why? Because I just did.

292
00:26:16,882 --> 00:26:19,282
I wish I could tell you something
else, but I just did it.

293
00:26:20,752 --> 00:26:22,952
It was like...

294
00:26:23,054 --> 00:26:25,755
like pushing open a door.

295
00:26:25,857 --> 00:26:27,557
You just push it.

296
00:26:30,095 --> 00:26:32,028
You know what I felt after?

297
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:35,565
Bad for my mom.

298
00:26:36,568 --> 00:26:38,334
She never understood it.

299
00:26:38,436 --> 00:26:39,569
To this day, doesn't.

300
00:26:39,671 --> 00:26:40,904
She was just like,

301
00:26:41,006 --> 00:26:42,372
"Why, Naz? Why'd you do it?

302
00:26:42,474 --> 00:26:44,641
This isn't you. I don't understand."

303
00:26:47,445 --> 00:26:49,279
Other than that, I felt nothing.

304
00:26:54,352 --> 00:26:56,119
You look at me like she did.

305
00:26:57,522 --> 00:26:59,889
"Why, Naz?"

306
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:03,893
No. I understand it.

307
00:27:05,196 --> 00:27:07,597
It wasn't so easy for me, either.

308
00:27:09,267 --> 00:27:11,134
You understand that.

309
00:27:12,437 --> 00:27:14,671
But maybe I did kill that girl.

310
00:27:16,575 --> 00:27:18,341
That's what you're thinking.

311
00:27:19,578 --> 00:27:20,677
No.

312
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:26,783
No.

313
00:28:15,867 --> 00:28:17,533
Big day tomorrow.

314
00:28:21,373 --> 00:28:23,272
Ladies and gentlemen...

315
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:24,974
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

316
00:28:25,076 --> 00:28:26,142
hello, I'm Chandra Kapoor,

317
00:28:26,244 --> 00:28:28,678
and I'm defending Mr. Nasir Khan.

318
00:28:30,015 --> 00:28:31,481
Oh, my God.

319
00:28:42,327 --> 00:28:44,160
Nick, Midleton.

320
00:29:20,865 --> 00:29:22,532
- Yeah?
- How's it coming along?

321
00:29:22,634 --> 00:29:23,766
I'm working on it.

322
00:29:23,868 --> 00:29:25,034
Read it to me.

323
00:29:25,136 --> 00:29:26,302
Nothing to read yet.

324
00:29:26,404 --> 00:29:27,470
I'll come over.

325
00:29:27,572 --> 00:29:28,771
No, I got it.

326
00:29:28,873 --> 00:29:31,441
Look, an opening statement's a memo,

327
00:29:31,543 --> 00:29:33,176
not the Gettysburg Address.

328
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:36,345
Get up there, tell 'em the burden
of proof is on the State,

329
00:29:36,448 --> 00:29:39,115
quote the
Constitution, get off the stage.

330
00:29:39,217 --> 00:29:41,150
Short and sweet. People have busy lives.

331
00:29:41,252 --> 00:29:42,719
Don't read 'em "War and Peace."

332
00:29:42,821 --> 00:29:44,721
I got it.

333
00:29:49,194 --> 00:29:50,960
Oh, God.

334
00:29:51,062 --> 00:29:52,762
A young woman gets in a cab,

335
00:29:52,864 --> 00:29:56,999
little does she know this is the
last cab ride she will ever take.

336
00:29:57,102 --> 00:30:00,036
She gets in, tells the driver
where she wants to go,

337
00:30:00,138 --> 00:30:02,705
just like we've all
done a million times.

338
00:30:02,807 --> 00:30:06,776
She's just 22 years old, and she's dead.

339
00:30:41,613 --> 00:30:44,313
$18.50.

340
00:30:45,717 --> 00:30:46,949
Um...

341
00:30:50,088 --> 00:30:52,054
I'll be... I'll be right back.

342
00:31:35,133 --> 00:31:36,199
Yo.

343
00:31:36,301 --> 00:31:39,602
Thank you, but my mom's
bringing me clothes.

344
00:31:41,105 --> 00:31:44,574
Yeah, but they won't be right.

345
00:31:48,146 --> 00:31:49,278
Thank you.

346
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,016
Your funeral.

347
00:33:19,637 --> 00:33:20,903
Hey.

348
00:33:21,005 --> 00:33:22,249
You're not gonna believe this...

349
00:33:22,273 --> 00:33:24,206
Don't talk to me. I'm
working on my opening.

350
00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:26,776
Now?

351
00:33:26,878 --> 00:33:28,344
Look.

352
00:33:30,481 --> 00:33:32,381
Hey. Hey.

353
00:33:32,483 --> 00:33:34,016
Look.

354
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:36,319
I went to this Chinese guy.

355
00:33:36,421 --> 00:33:39,722
He gave me some kind of
tree bark or fish powder.

356
00:33:39,824 --> 00:33:41,791
I don't know what the fuck it was,

357
00:33:41,893 --> 00:33:43,993
but it just...

358
00:33:44,095 --> 00:33:45,628
Huh.

359
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,598
What the hell is this?

360
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,634
You look like an extra
from "West Side Story."

361
00:34:25,737 --> 00:34:28,204
Cheryl, get those cuffs off him.

362
00:34:28,306 --> 00:34:29,538
Give him to me for a minute.

363
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,673
Thanks. Let's go.

364
00:34:30,775 --> 00:34:31,975
- What?
- Come on. Take it off.

365
00:34:32,043 --> 00:34:33,843
Take it off. Your shirt.
What? You kidding me?

366
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:36,078
I'm not kidding. It doesn't look good.

367
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,447
You can't wear royal blue
in a courtroom, okay?

368
00:34:38,549 --> 00:34:41,069
You gotta wear a white shirt. The
defendant wears a white shirt.

369
00:34:41,152 --> 00:34:42,318
That's not a white shirt.

370
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:45,087
Well, it's whiter than yours. Come on.

371
00:34:45,189 --> 00:34:48,924
I've done this
before. It's the wrong color.

372
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:53,262
The jury, they're coming in.

373
00:34:53,364 --> 00:34:55,631
That's all right. They don't
know what's going on.

374
00:34:57,135 --> 00:34:59,035
Just relax. They don't know who you are.

375
00:34:59,137 --> 00:35:00,970
Just two guys.

376
00:35:02,173 --> 00:35:03,506
Relax. Okay.

377
00:35:03,608 --> 00:35:05,508
- But it looks stupid.
- It doesn't look stupid.

378
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:06,675
Okay?

379
00:35:06,778 --> 00:35:08,878
The shirt you have on looks good.

380
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,150
All rise.

381
00:35:17,622 --> 00:35:19,255
Let's go. Come on.

382
00:35:23,094 --> 00:35:24,660
Good morning, everybody.

383
00:35:24,762 --> 00:35:26,162
Have a seat.

384
00:35:43,981 --> 00:35:46,315
Good morning, jurors.

385
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:48,417
My name is Helen Weiss.

386
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:51,554
I work for the District
Attorney of New York.

387
00:35:51,656 --> 00:35:55,257
But my real employer,
as I come before you today,

388
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,860
is a young woman who lies in a grave

389
00:35:57,962 --> 00:35:59,995
at St. Raymond's Cemetery.

390
00:36:00,098 --> 00:36:03,099
It's my job for her to speak to you,

391
00:36:03,201 --> 00:36:06,902
to take you on a tour of her
final, desperate hours.

392
00:36:07,004 --> 00:36:11,941
On it you will visit every
stop she visited with the defendant

393
00:36:12,043 --> 00:36:15,578
on his cold,
calculating itinerary that night,

394
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,148
which started with a
stolen car in Queens,

395
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,584
and ended with a young woman

396
00:36:21,686 --> 00:36:26,355
brutally stabbed to death in her bed.

397
00:36:26,457 --> 00:36:29,358
Before I take you on this
tour through hell,

398
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,760
a word to the wise.

399
00:36:31,863 --> 00:36:36,999
Be not distracted by
Mr. Khan's benign appearance

400
00:36:37,101 --> 00:36:41,537
as he sits here with us
in his dress shirt and tie,

401
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:43,806
nor by attempts by his attorneys

402
00:36:43,908 --> 00:36:47,009
to linger on the
victim's personal struggles

403
00:36:47,111 --> 00:36:50,012
in her all-too-brief life.

404
00:36:50,114 --> 00:36:53,516
This case isn't about Andrea's life.

405
00:36:56,187 --> 00:36:58,254
It's about her death.

406
00:37:15,873 --> 00:37:19,141
Mrs. Weiss... she prefers
to be called "missus,"

407
00:37:19,243 --> 00:37:23,345
gets to take you on her tour
before I can take you on mine.

408
00:37:23,447 --> 00:37:26,015
And that's fine. That's how it works.

409
00:37:26,117 --> 00:37:29,518
The State gets to go first,
then the Defense.

410
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:33,889
All I ask is you keep an open
mind and remember this,

411
00:37:33,991 --> 00:37:38,827
there is no burden on me to prove to
you the defendant didn't commit the crime.

412
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:44,633
The burden is on the State
to prove he did. Thank you.

413
00:37:52,476 --> 00:37:54,276
In the normal course of a day,

414
00:37:54,378 --> 00:37:57,846
what percentage of the
vehicles approaching the Midtown Tunnel

415
00:37:57,949 --> 00:37:59,915
is recorded by security cameras?

416
00:38:00,017 --> 00:38:01,450
A hundred percent.

417
00:38:01,552 --> 00:38:04,853
This one came through on October 24th

418
00:38:04,956 --> 00:38:07,022
at 9:17 p.m. it says there.

419
00:38:07,124 --> 00:38:08,624
And there's an E-ZPass record

420
00:38:08,726 --> 00:38:10,526
of the same vehicle at the same time.

421
00:38:10,628 --> 00:38:12,394
- This.
- Yes.

422
00:38:12,496 --> 00:38:15,631
Same plate
registration, medallion, and VIN.

423
00:38:15,733 --> 00:38:17,967
Have you checked the
plates and registration

424
00:38:18,069 --> 00:38:19,535
to see who owns this cab?

425
00:38:19,637 --> 00:38:24,373
Yes. Yousef Bashir,
Tariq Mazari, and Salim Khan.

426
00:38:24,475 --> 00:38:27,910
Which of them was driving it the
night it came into Manhattan?

427
00:38:28,012 --> 00:38:29,979
None of them.

428
00:38:32,717 --> 00:38:35,718
He seemed upset that these
guys wouldn't get out of his cab.

429
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,253
He wanted them out,

430
00:38:37,355 --> 00:38:39,054
in no uncertain terms?

431
00:38:39,156 --> 00:38:40,589
Yeah.

432
00:38:44,595 --> 00:38:45,995
There they go.

433
00:38:52,637 --> 00:38:55,104
One of those bottles looks like water,

434
00:38:55,206 --> 00:38:57,206
but I can't tell what the other is,

435
00:38:57,308 --> 00:38:58,474
can you?

436
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,443
Beer.

437
00:39:01,545 --> 00:39:03,479
Whose DNA is on this?

438
00:39:03,581 --> 00:39:06,282
The defendant, the victim's or both?

439
00:39:06,384 --> 00:39:08,217
Only the victim's.

440
00:39:08,319 --> 00:39:09,551
Okay.

441
00:39:09,654 --> 00:39:13,055
So, after buying her beer in Harlem,

442
00:39:13,157 --> 00:39:15,624
he drove her to West 87th Street,

443
00:39:15,726 --> 00:39:19,728
according to this parking violation
issued at 1:55 a.m.

444
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:22,498
Whose blood is on this?

445
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,733
The defendant's.

446
00:39:24,835 --> 00:39:27,136
Any chance you could be wrong?

447
00:39:27,238 --> 00:39:30,806
Yes, one in five billion.

448
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:14,550
Well, what's this doctor's name?

449
00:40:14,652 --> 00:40:16,218
Doctor Yee.

450
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,420
Y-E-E.

451
00:40:18,522 --> 00:40:22,024
The guy is a miracle
worker. He's Anne Sullivan!

452
00:40:22,126 --> 00:40:26,228
Three hundred dollars,
and he throws in aphrodisiacs.

453
00:40:33,871 --> 00:40:35,637
You know why I'm here?

454
00:40:37,508 --> 00:40:39,808
I don't ask that question.

455
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:42,177
I mean, here, Rikers.

456
00:40:42,279 --> 00:40:44,213
Not up north at Clinton.

457
00:40:46,384 --> 00:40:49,651
Took my wife seven hours
on a Greyhound bus

458
00:40:49,754 --> 00:40:52,254
traveling with the kids to come see me.

459
00:40:53,991 --> 00:40:56,558
So I got a dude in my crew

460
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,161
to put another body on me.

461
00:40:59,263 --> 00:41:01,830
New charge, new trial,
know what I'm saying?

462
00:41:03,701 --> 00:41:05,901
So now I'm back down here,

463
00:41:06,003 --> 00:41:08,670
bus ride's only 20 minutes away.

464
00:41:08,773 --> 00:41:12,141
What's one more murder charge,
the fuck I care, right?

465
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,348
Yo, let me ask you something.

466
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,620
Did you like your life out there?

467
00:41:26,023 --> 00:41:27,623
My life?

468
00:41:27,725 --> 00:41:29,425
Yeah.

469
00:41:29,527 --> 00:41:31,226
Yeah, I guess.

470
00:41:31,328 --> 00:41:32,594
Hmm.

471
00:41:34,298 --> 00:41:36,765
God's honest truth,

472
00:41:36,867 --> 00:41:39,935
whether you're in here or out there...

473
00:41:41,405 --> 00:41:43,605
you know who you are,

474
00:41:43,707 --> 00:41:45,841
how to get what you need.

475
00:41:47,311 --> 00:41:49,678
Shit, sweet can be had anywhere.

476
00:42:56,213 --> 00:42:59,281
Upon observing the vehicle
proceed across an intersection

477
00:42:59,383 --> 00:43:02,484
in violation of a posted
no left turn sign,

478
00:43:02,586 --> 00:43:04,186
we commenced pursuit.

479
00:43:04,288 --> 00:43:07,823
After pulling him over, I
requested to see his driver's license,

480
00:43:07,925 --> 00:43:10,859
detected the smell of alcohol,
and asked him to blow.

481
00:43:10,961 --> 00:43:14,730
- Blow?
- Take a BACtrack for me. Breathalyzer.

482
00:43:14,832 --> 00:43:15,872
That's when the call came.

483
00:43:15,933 --> 00:43:18,700
A break-in at 144 West 87th street.

484
00:43:18,802 --> 00:43:22,371
Since we were the closest car to
the address, we said we would respond.

485
00:43:22,473 --> 00:43:24,172
So, you let Mr. Khan go?

486
00:43:24,275 --> 00:43:25,707
No. We took him with us.

487
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:28,810
I didn't want him driving off
in his cab given how intox he was.

488
00:43:28,913 --> 00:43:32,047
Objection. The officer just
said no test was given.

489
00:43:32,149 --> 00:43:34,283
She's got a point.

490
00:43:34,385 --> 00:43:35,918
If he didn't blow,

491
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,120
how would you know
how intoxicated he was?

492
00:43:38,222 --> 00:43:41,089
'Cause his eyes looked like two
cherries floating in buttermilk,

493
00:43:41,191 --> 00:43:44,126
and he reeked like someone just dropped
a bomb in a tequila factory.

494
00:43:47,298 --> 00:43:49,398
Okay.

495
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,699
Then what happened?

496
00:43:50,801 --> 00:43:53,602
After we arrived at the scene,
we found the victim,

497
00:43:53,704 --> 00:43:55,170
called for homicide.

498
00:43:55,272 --> 00:43:56,538
Detective Box arrived,

499
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,774
and noticed Mr. Khan in the
back of our patrol car,

500
00:43:58,876 --> 00:44:01,476
and instructed that I get
someone to take him back to the house,

501
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:02,644
which I did.

502
00:44:02,746 --> 00:44:03,745
The house?

503
00:44:03,847 --> 00:44:05,013
The precinct.

504
00:44:05,115 --> 00:44:07,015
So, he's gone now.

505
00:44:07,117 --> 00:44:08,750
You're still at the scene.

506
00:44:08,852 --> 00:44:11,153
Is that the last you saw him that night?

507
00:44:11,255 --> 00:44:13,622
No. Once everybody
was doing their thing,

508
00:44:13,724 --> 00:44:16,291
CSU, ME, we went back to the precinct.

509
00:44:16,393 --> 00:44:18,560
The desk sergeant
told us to cut him loose,

510
00:44:18,662 --> 00:44:20,996
since, at that point,
too much time had passed

511
00:44:21,065 --> 00:44:22,331
to test his alcohol level.

512
00:44:22,433 --> 00:44:23,999
So, per standard procedure,

513
00:44:24,101 --> 00:44:26,501
I patted him down to make
sure he wasn't armed.

514
00:44:26,604 --> 00:44:28,537
And that's when I found it.

515
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:31,239
- It?
- That.

516
00:44:31,342 --> 00:44:32,674
This.

517
00:44:34,178 --> 00:44:36,445
In his jacket pocket.

518
00:44:36,547 --> 00:44:40,849
Did he try to explain how he
came to have this knife in his pocket?

519
00:44:40,951 --> 00:44:44,286
No. He tried to make a run for it.

520
00:44:45,389 --> 00:44:47,189
How far did he get?

521
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:50,359
Not far, but it took two other officers
and myself to restrain him.

522
00:44:50,461 --> 00:44:53,362
Three trained officers?

523
00:44:53,464 --> 00:44:56,131
Yeah, and it wasn't easy.
Fought like a bull.

524
00:44:59,269 --> 00:45:00,736
- What's your name, son?
- Nasir.

525
00:45:00,838 --> 00:45:01,837
You don't understand.

526
00:45:01,939 --> 00:45:03,905
That's why we're gonna talk, okay?

527
00:45:04,008 --> 00:45:05,607
So I will understand.

528
00:45:05,709 --> 00:45:07,209
Just you and me.

529
00:45:07,311 --> 00:45:08,377
Come over here.

530
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,611
Please, let go, I...

531
00:45:09,713 --> 00:45:11,780
No, no, I didn't do it!

532
00:45:11,882 --> 00:45:13,815
I didn't... I didn't do it!

533
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,453
Give me your arm! Get on the ground!

534
00:45:18,555 --> 00:45:20,055
Hands behind your back!

535
00:45:20,157 --> 00:45:21,590
Give me your arm!

536
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:27,362
Before this, in your patrol car
on the way to the precinct,

537
00:45:27,464 --> 00:45:29,164
what was his demeanor?

538
00:45:29,266 --> 00:45:30,699
Quiet, mostly.

539
00:45:30,801 --> 00:45:32,200
Not a peep?

540
00:45:32,302 --> 00:45:34,102
No, he did say one thing.

541
00:45:34,204 --> 00:45:35,370
What did he say?

542
00:45:37,675 --> 00:45:39,107
Is she dead?

543
00:45:41,412 --> 00:45:43,178
"Is she dead?"

544
00:45:44,114 --> 00:45:45,414
What did you make of that?

545
00:45:45,516 --> 00:45:47,849
Nothing at the time 'cause
I thought he was a witness.

546
00:45:47,951 --> 00:45:51,019
Then Officer Wiggins pulled
the knife out of his pocket.

547
00:45:53,557 --> 00:45:54,756
Thank you.

548
00:45:56,326 --> 00:45:57,726
Your witness.

549
00:46:01,365 --> 00:46:02,898
"Is she dead?"

550
00:46:05,169 --> 00:46:06,868
Does that sound to you like something

551
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:08,503
somebody would say to a police officer

552
00:46:08,605 --> 00:46:10,205
if he'd just committed a murder?

553
00:46:10,307 --> 00:46:11,173
I don't know.

554
00:46:11,275 --> 00:46:12,874
I once collared a rape suspect

555
00:46:12,976 --> 00:46:14,656
that asked to go back
to the victim's house

556
00:46:14,745 --> 00:46:16,478
to look for his car keys.

557
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:21,283
Thank you.

558
00:46:23,754 --> 00:46:26,254
Dude is okay from what I understand.

559
00:46:26,356 --> 00:46:28,423
It's that girl I'm worried about.

560
00:46:28,525 --> 00:46:30,659
Too young.

561
00:46:30,761 --> 00:46:32,661
Well, at least she believes me.

562
00:46:34,331 --> 00:46:36,331
See, that's what I'm talking about.

563
00:46:37,601 --> 00:46:39,234
That ain't important.

564
00:46:42,873 --> 00:46:45,340
Only a new lawyer wouldn't know that.

565
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:47,903
Hello?

566
00:47:48,005 --> 00:47:50,472
Hey. Hey, it's me.

567
00:47:51,408 --> 00:47:53,241
This caller ID said unavailable.

568
00:47:54,812 --> 00:47:57,045
That's pretty accurate.

569
00:47:58,882 --> 00:48:01,817
Oh, don't worry, it's not
being recorded. This is my cell.

570
00:48:03,253 --> 00:48:05,020
They allow cell phones?

571
00:48:06,523 --> 00:48:07,989
Okay I call you?

572
00:48:08,091 --> 00:48:10,192
Um, yeah.

573
00:48:10,294 --> 00:48:13,395
Is there a problem? Are you all right?

574
00:48:17,434 --> 00:48:19,154
You know, one of the things
you miss in here

575
00:48:19,203 --> 00:48:20,747
is being able to say
good night to someone

576
00:48:20,771 --> 00:48:22,704
that's not an animal in a fucking zoo.

577
00:48:24,842 --> 00:48:27,576
It used to be my parents
or my brother, you know?

578
00:48:29,146 --> 00:48:31,379
It still is, you should call them.

579
00:48:33,283 --> 00:48:34,783
I don't think so.

580
00:48:38,555 --> 00:48:40,188
Listen, I just wanted to say thank you

581
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:42,357
for everything you're doing for me.

582
00:48:44,127 --> 00:48:46,294
And that I hope it doesn't scare you

583
00:48:46,396 --> 00:48:47,963
if I say...

584
00:48:56,707 --> 00:48:58,073
good night.

585
00:49:09,453 --> 00:49:11,152
Use that phone, playboy?

586
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:14,389
Where's your green dot?

587
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,606
Aah!

588
00:50:04,708 --> 00:50:06,141
What'd you see?

589
00:50:06,243 --> 00:50:07,776
Hmm?

590
00:50:07,878 --> 00:50:08,944
What'd you see?

591
00:50:09,046 --> 00:50:10,478
Nothing.

592
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,846
What you gonna tell Freddy?

593
00:50:11,949 --> 00:50:13,949
Nothing. Hmm?

594
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:01,496
Hey.

595
00:51:01,598 --> 00:51:03,698
Let me ask you something. Not now.

596
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,734
How much you think this place is worth?

597
00:51:05,836 --> 00:51:07,268
Ten million?

598
00:51:07,371 --> 00:51:10,605
So how is it an unemployed, 22-year-old,

599
00:51:10,707 --> 00:51:12,674
drug-addled party girl

600
00:51:12,776 --> 00:51:15,343
lives there like Eloise at the Plaza?

601
00:51:15,445 --> 00:51:16,678
Mmm. Hmm?

602
00:52:21,011 --> 00:52:23,144
You're not looking
for a financial advisor.

603
00:52:23,246 --> 00:52:25,780
No, I don't have enough money to bother.

604
00:52:25,882 --> 00:52:27,816
This is about Andrea.

605
00:52:27,918 --> 00:52:29,350
I'm an attorney.

606
00:52:29,453 --> 00:52:31,152
For?

607
00:52:31,254 --> 00:52:33,288
Nasir Khan.

608
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:36,024
- The guy who...
- Who's not been convicted.

609
00:52:36,126 --> 00:52:37,459
Yeah.

610
00:52:37,561 --> 00:52:39,861
I saw you at Andrea's funeral

611
00:52:39,963 --> 00:52:42,530
arguing with some guy...

612
00:52:42,632 --> 00:52:44,766
I didn't know at the time

613
00:52:44,868 --> 00:52:46,634
was her stepfather.

614
00:52:46,736 --> 00:52:47,976
I'm part of the fucking family!

615
00:52:48,071 --> 00:52:51,840
What was it about? That?

616
00:52:51,942 --> 00:52:54,309
Look, I really can't
talk about my clients.

617
00:52:54,411 --> 00:52:57,045
Like you, it's a matter
of confidentiality.

618
00:52:57,147 --> 00:52:58,947
Okay.

619
00:52:59,049 --> 00:53:01,249
Look, I was hoping
that you could help me

620
00:53:01,351 --> 00:53:03,118
with some, uh...

621
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:06,087
background information, off the record.

622
00:53:06,189 --> 00:53:08,056
But if that's impossible, you know,

623
00:53:08,158 --> 00:53:10,558
we'll have to do it more formally

624
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:13,094
with a subpoena and all that.

625
00:53:13,196 --> 00:53:17,165
One way or the other, I gotta do my job.

626
00:53:18,502 --> 00:53:19,734
Off the record.

627
00:53:21,638 --> 00:53:25,006
Off the record,
sitting here, just us chickens.

628
00:53:25,108 --> 00:53:28,042
You know, I never
understood that expression.

629
00:53:28,145 --> 00:53:29,911
Me neither.

630
00:53:30,981 --> 00:53:32,046
Close the door.

631
00:53:37,754 --> 00:53:42,157
Evelyn, Andrea's mother,
she was my client.

632
00:53:42,259 --> 00:53:44,025
When she died, Andrea came to me

633
00:53:44,127 --> 00:53:45,593
to help her sort things out.

634
00:53:45,695 --> 00:53:48,363
I mean, no 20-year-old kid
should have to deal with that,

635
00:53:48,465 --> 00:53:51,533
but, well, sometimes they do.

636
00:53:52,602 --> 00:53:54,636
One of the things I had to tell her

637
00:53:54,738 --> 00:53:57,839
was that her mother's husband,
of just two years,

638
00:53:57,941 --> 00:54:00,008
might get half of everything.

639
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:02,310
I didn't know him at the time.

640
00:54:02,412 --> 00:54:04,245
Well, I didn't know
Andrea at the time either

641
00:54:04,347 --> 00:54:05,780
except for Evelyn mentioning her.

642
00:54:05,882 --> 00:54:09,484
But as I'm working with her
on this, then I got to know him.

643
00:54:09,586 --> 00:54:11,152
- Mm-hmm.
- You met him, Don?

644
00:54:11,254 --> 00:54:13,922
I just seen him at
the funeral, at the trial.

645
00:54:14,024 --> 00:54:15,624
Well, you can see just
by looking at him,

646
00:54:15,659 --> 00:54:18,593
he's younger than most 60-year-old
women's husbands by like, 25 years.

647
00:54:18,695 --> 00:54:23,665
Well, it turns out he's got quite
a history with the gray ladies. Yeah.

648
00:54:23,767 --> 00:54:26,501
He's got quite a history
with a few other things, too,

649
00:54:26,603 --> 00:54:27,902
like restraining orders.

650
00:54:28,004 --> 00:54:29,604
Really?

651
00:54:29,706 --> 00:54:31,472
He threatened me, I can tell you that.

652
00:54:31,575 --> 00:54:34,409
And it was fucking scary.

653
00:54:35,779 --> 00:54:37,579
So, here he is,

654
00:54:37,681 --> 00:54:39,447
personal trainer by trade,

655
00:54:39,549 --> 00:54:40,782
if you can call that a trade,

656
00:54:40,884 --> 00:54:42,684
makes 30 grand a year, if he's lucky,

657
00:54:42,786 --> 00:54:45,019
stops working
altogether when he marries Evelyn.

658
00:54:45,121 --> 00:54:46,487
Doesn't work a day after that.

659
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:48,590
And he wants half of everything
Andrea's got.

660
00:54:48,692 --> 00:54:52,760
I mean, some kind of "Driving
Miss Daisy" gratuity, sure.

661
00:54:52,862 --> 00:54:55,063
But five or six million dollars?

662
00:54:55,165 --> 00:54:57,065
Andrea said no way.

663
00:54:58,868 --> 00:55:00,635
Actually...

664
00:55:04,574 --> 00:55:08,476
Actually, what she said
was, "Over my dead body."

665
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:16,150
Guess he gets it all now.

666
00:55:33,336 --> 00:55:35,069
Keep going.

667
00:55:35,171 --> 00:55:36,271
That's right.

668
00:55:36,373 --> 00:55:38,039
You're getting it.

669
00:55:38,141 --> 00:55:40,174
You're good.

670
00:55:49,953 --> 00:55:52,720
So, you're here most of the time?

671
00:55:52,822 --> 00:55:54,022
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

672
00:55:59,643 --> 00:56:05,406

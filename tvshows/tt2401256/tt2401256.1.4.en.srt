He does his homework.

Give me yours. I'll put my number
in. You can shoot it in texts.

179
00:14:07,192 --> 00:14:09,859
So they can trace it back to me? Nope.

00:23:07,665 --> 00:23:10,766
We've got a full dance
card today, folks.

315
00:23:10,868 --> 00:23:13,535
Not guilty. Not guilty.

316
00:23:13,637 --> 00:23:15,104
There you go.

317
00:23:15,206 --> 00:23:16,939
Your Honor, at this point,

318
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:18,941
I am filing a copy of
the indictment report

319
00:23:19,043 --> 00:23:20,743
and the victim
disclosure statement report.

320
00:23:20,845 --> 00:23:23,045
Alison: Your Honor, I wasn't here
for the preliminary arraignment

321
00:23:23,147 --> 00:23:24,680
due to the fact that
I wasn't yet retained,

322
00:23:24,782 --> 00:23:27,349
but I'm certainly here now.
And it is my understanding

323
00:23:27,451 --> 00:23:29,611
that when my client was remanded
at that first hearing,

324
00:23:29,653 --> 00:23:31,754
he was advised the issue of reasonable

325
00:23:31,856 --> 00:23:35,224
and affordable bail would be revisited,
so that's what we're doing now.

326
00:23:35,326 --> 00:23:38,160
Mr. Khan vigorously maintains
his innocence and is intent

327
00:23:38,262 --> 00:23:40,629
on fighting these
charges until he's exonerated.

328
00:23:40,731 --> 00:23:43,832
He wants to go to trial, and
so is not a flight risk.

329
00:23:43,934 --> 00:23:46,183
If we instead would
like to see a young man

330
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:48,661
with no criminal record
turned into a criminal,

331
00:23:48,739 --> 00:23:52,574
then let's have him sit at Rikers as
long as the slow wheels of justice take.

332
00:23:52,676 --> 00:23:54,877
Your Honor, it's a felony
murder. He's facing life.

333
00:23:54,979 --> 00:23:57,613
There's no bail high enough
to guarantee he won't take off.

334
00:23:57,715 --> 00:24:01,016
(chuckles) Where? Where is he gonna go?

335
00:24:01,118 --> 00:24:03,418
To Pakistan, where he's never been?

336
00:24:03,521 --> 00:24:06,488
To some al-Qaeda training camp?
I mean, what is going on here?

337
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,056
There's nothing going on here.

338
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,259
Well, he doesn't even own a passport,

339
00:24:10,361 --> 00:24:12,427
so where is he going to go?

340
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,097
Your Honor, I don't
know if it was media pressure

341
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:18,233
or political pressure or just
good old-fashioned 9/11 profiling,

342
00:24:18,335 --> 00:24:21,303
but I have never seen a grand
jury dance so fast in my life,

343
00:24:21,405 --> 00:24:23,438
leaving me no time to properly prepare.

344
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:25,974
Prepare for what? This isn't his trial.

345
00:24:26,076 --> 00:24:28,343
You'll have plenty of time to prepare.

346
00:24:28,445 --> 00:24:31,547
And it's not as if he didn't
have professional counsel before.

347
00:24:31,649 --> 00:24:35,918
Excuse me? "Professional
counsel"? He had John Stone.

348
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,486
(laughter)

349
00:24:37,588 --> 00:24:39,655
- Judge: Ms. Crowe...
- Alison: Your Honor?

350
00:24:39,757 --> 00:24:42,291
Not in my court.

351
00:24:42,393 --> 00:24:45,160
I apologize.

352
00:24:45,262 --> 00:24:49,264
Your client seems to have a
little trouble looking at me.

353
00:24:49,366 --> 00:24:51,900
Look at the judge.

354
00:24:52,002 --> 00:24:53,335
That's better.

355
00:24:53,437 --> 00:24:57,706
Mr. Khan, I see no reason
to change your bail status.

356
00:24:57,808 --> 00:25:03,612
You remain on remand, and
we're done here. Next.

357
00:25:07,918 --> 00:25:10,052
Bailiff: The people vs. Luke Waltman,

358
00:25:10,154 --> 00:25:14,456
indictment number 6244 of year 2014.

359
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:19,728
Johnny, that was uncalled for.

360
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,664
This is not a level playing field here.

361
00:25:22,766 --> 00:25:25,067
The victim is an upper-class Caucasian,

362
00:25:25,169 --> 00:25:30,105
the accused a striving member of one of
the most reviled ethnicities in America.

363
00:25:30,207 --> 00:25:31,673
May I say something?

364
00:25:31,775 --> 00:25:33,442
My client was consciously over-indicted

365
00:25:33,544 --> 00:25:36,578
by a D.A.'s office eager to
score fast and score big,

366
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,281
and we look forward to our
day in court. Thank you.

Why the green one?

382

Because orange means violent felon.

Don't worry about it, man. We

Let me show you something.

Out of all of this, what
am I most proud of?

Yeah, that's right.

See, most convicts...

396
00:28:54,178 --> 00:28:55,818
I mean, they got any
kind of paper at all,

397
00:28:55,913 --> 00:29:00,916
it's some "study in your
cell at night" GED bullshit.

See, me, I like
school, so I did it right.

00:29:05,022 --> 00:29:09,124
I mean, life wound up taking
me where it took me,

400
00:29:09,226 --> 00:29:11,426
but still, right?

books in the prison library is?

"The Art of War," for obvious reasons.

404

And "The Other Side of Midnight,"
for obvious reasons.

dude right there, Victor?

413
00:30:09,386 --> 00:30:12,654
I asked him once, "Well,
where's the Gaza Strip?"

414
00:30:12,756 --> 00:30:17,526
You want to know what he said? "Vegas."

That's why you.

419
00:30:37,147 --> 00:30:40,148
But you still got to ask,

420
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,651
or I can't help you.

421
00:30:42,753 --> 00:30:45,387
Help me what?

422
00:30:45,489 --> 00:30:48,323
Survive.

the same age as your bro.

Now, how much time he did?

00:33:16,973 --> 00:33:19,674
Two years. Why?

455
00:33:19,776 --> 00:33:22,744
'Cause the verdict
got overturned on appeal.

456

Bad instructions to the jury, and the county
prosecutor office didn't want to retry.

home to get my whistle.

Boom. Miss. Caught a busboy instead.

463
00:33:49,306 --> 00:33:52,140
So now my niece is dead,

464

busboy's dead, and I'm in here,

465

and that nigga's out there like a

00:34:11,228 --> 00:34:13,862
Okay.

the right to do that.

473
00:34:50,767 --> 00:34:53,435
(indistinct conversations)

474
00:34:59,476 --> 00:35:03,244
If we see any more of
these headlines with his face...

475
00:35:03,346 --> 00:35:06,781
(continues indistinctly)

476
00:35:18,695 --> 00:35:21,763
The guy's a Sikh, and he
gets beat half to death.

477
00:35:21,865 --> 00:35:24,766
Offer them low murder,
and we're done with it.

478
00:35:29,573 --> 00:35:31,639
Doctor: Oh, my God,
what the hell is this?

479
00:35:31,741 --> 00:35:33,374
You look like you've been
going after yourself

480
00:35:33,477 --> 00:35:35,076
with a sharpened pencil or something.

481
00:35:35,178 --> 00:35:37,111
Chopstick.

482
00:35:37,214 --> 00:35:39,280
Well, I had a guy use
a knitting needle once.

483
00:35:39,382 --> 00:35:41,416
You could see right through it
to the ankle bone with that one.

484
00:35:41,518 --> 00:35:44,552
You wouldn't believe what
people do to themselves. I would.

485
00:35:44,654 --> 00:35:47,922
I'm ready to jump out a window.

486
00:35:48,024 --> 00:35:49,691
Yeah, I've seen that, too.

487
00:35:49,793 --> 00:35:52,861
Uh, so what's in the bag? Is
that your medicine or your lunch?

488
00:35:52,963 --> 00:35:55,063
What I've been
using from another doctor.

489
00:35:55,165 --> 00:35:56,464
Gimme.

490
00:36:02,272 --> 00:36:04,939
Just level with me.

491
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:07,375
Is there any fucking hope?

492
00:36:08,378 --> 00:36:10,478
Not with any of this.

493
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,147
And not with you gouging yourself
like that, either.

494
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,885
First, you're gonna go to
a pharmacy and pick this up.

495
00:36:16,987 --> 00:36:22,957
This is real medicine, not Mickey Mouse
medicine, a serious corticosteroid.

496
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:24,926
Then you're gonna go to
a medical-supply place,

497
00:36:25,028 --> 00:36:26,995
get a U.V. lamp... they're
a little pricey...

498
00:36:27,097 --> 00:36:29,931
and some U.V. glasses.

499
00:36:30,033 --> 00:36:31,766
Then you're gonna go to a grocery store,

500
00:36:31,868 --> 00:36:34,636
get some Clorox, and bathe in it.

501
00:36:34,738 --> 00:36:39,741
Here's how much to use. Clorox bleach?

502
00:36:39,843 --> 00:36:41,763
Or you can keep hacking
away with your chopsticks

503
00:36:41,845 --> 00:36:43,912
until you're walking around
on your kneecaps.

504
00:36:44,014 --> 00:36:46,548
It's up to you.

505
00:36:58,328 --> 00:37:01,663
(panting)

506
00:37:16,112 --> 00:37:17,845
Yo, Freddy.

507
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:22,283
Hey, Freddy, man. We ain't got no beef.

508
00:37:22,385 --> 00:37:25,620
Beef? Who said anything about a beef?

509
00:37:25,722 --> 00:37:28,389
Just looking for a big man to spar with.

510
00:37:28,491 --> 00:37:30,658
(grunts)

511
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,528
- Come on, Fred.
- Freddy: "Come on," what?

512
00:37:33,663 --> 00:37:35,697
Man, I heard you took
silver in the Gloves, man.

513
00:37:35,799 --> 00:37:38,900
Show me what you got, baby!

514
00:37:43,173 --> 00:37:45,139
That's what I'm talking
about. I like that.

515
00:37:46,476 --> 00:37:47,809
Oh, shit.

516
00:37:47,911 --> 00:37:50,712
For real, for real, huh? That's
what I'm talking about.

517
00:37:50,814 --> 00:37:52,447
Chill, man.

518
00:37:54,484 --> 00:37:56,718
What's up with that cell
phone business, bro?

519
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,986
I ain't got no cell phone business.

520
00:37:58,088 --> 00:37:59,648
I don't know what you're talking about.

521
00:37:59,689 --> 00:38:03,057
Shit, dawg. I must have
heard wrong, then.

522
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:06,060
(grunting)

523
00:38:06,162 --> 00:38:10,632
Come on, Freddy. I told you, I
don't know what you're talking about.

524
00:38:11,901 --> 00:38:14,569
(grunting) Oh, man.

525
00:38:14,671 --> 00:38:16,237
Not one cell phone?

526
00:38:18,241 --> 00:38:20,108
- Oh!
- (heart beating)

527
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:23,411
(grunting)

528
00:38:51,374 --> 00:38:54,642
We'll knock five years
off the max, 25 to life.

529
00:38:54,744 --> 00:38:56,678
He'll be before a parole board in 20.

530
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,479
Before them for what? Murder is murder.

531
00:38:58,581 --> 00:39:00,048
They'll never let him
out, and you know it.

532
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,517
You want to talk seriously?
Take life off the table.

533
00:39:02,619 --> 00:39:04,452
Oh, I don't think I can do that.

534
00:39:04,554 --> 00:39:06,821
Well, I won't be able to sell
him on an indeterminate sentence,

535
00:39:06,923 --> 00:39:10,625
so I guess that's it.

536
00:39:10,727 --> 00:39:15,596
Murder two, no sex
assault, capped at 25.

537
00:39:15,699 --> 00:39:17,665
Man one, flat 10.

538
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:19,867
You're kidding. No, I'm not kidding.

539
00:39:19,969 --> 00:39:22,770
High man, 20, serves 15.

540
00:39:22,872 --> 00:39:25,339
Okay. We'll take our
chances with the jury.

541
00:39:25,442 --> 00:39:30,545
That's it? You expect me to
negotiate against myself?

542
00:39:30,647 --> 00:39:35,183
Yes. Man one, flat 15.

543
00:39:35,285 --> 00:39:37,051
I can try that with him.

544
00:39:37,153 --> 00:39:41,122
I think you'll succeed.

545
00:39:41,224 --> 00:39:42,790
(Muzak playing)

546
00:39:42,892 --> 00:39:44,926
20 milligrams. Wow.

547
00:39:45,028 --> 00:39:47,361
- John: What?
- Nothing.

548
00:39:47,464 --> 00:39:49,630
What? It's just...

549
00:39:49,733 --> 00:39:52,266
I'm not saying it's gonna happen,

550
00:39:52,368 --> 00:39:56,037
but possible side effects
from taking steroids this strong...

551
00:39:56,139 --> 00:39:59,774
- Like?
- Like, you know, hair loss,

552
00:39:59,876 --> 00:40:01,642
explosive acne,

553
00:40:01,745 --> 00:40:06,581
uncontrollable crying
jags, shrinking balls.

554
00:40:06,683 --> 00:40:09,917
On the other hand, there's
an excellent chance

555
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:13,121
you'll hit 75 homers this year.

556
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,963
(sighs)

557
00:40:30,807 --> 00:40:33,141
Alison: What I say in
court is for the judge.

558
00:40:33,243 --> 00:40:35,042
What I say to the
press is for the public.

559
00:40:35,145 --> 00:40:39,046
But with you, I have to be
honest, and it is not good.

560
00:40:39,149 --> 00:40:41,849
Running away with a knife from the
scene of a brutal stabbing murder

561
00:40:41,951 --> 00:40:45,486
documented with photos that'll
make a jury's heart stop...

562
00:40:45,588 --> 00:40:50,224
But I didn't do it. We are way
past, "I didn't do it," Naz.

563
00:40:50,326 --> 00:40:53,261
Here's what time it
is. If you are convicted,

564
00:40:53,363 --> 00:40:57,932
which you likely will be, you will
spend the rest of your life in a cage,

565
00:40:58,034 --> 00:41:02,937
waking up every morning
wishing you were dead, unless...

566
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:05,185
- Unless?
- Unless I can somehow

567
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:07,432
convince the D.A.'s office,

568
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:10,611
and it is a long shot, to
accept a plea of manslaughter

569
00:41:10,713 --> 00:41:15,149
with a max sentence of, say, 15 years.

570
00:41:15,251 --> 00:41:19,453
But I'm not gonna fight for you on this
unless you can say, "Yes, I accept that.

571
00:41:19,556 --> 00:41:20,955
It's better than the alternative."

572
00:41:21,057 --> 00:41:25,993
And, Nasir, believe me, it is.

573
00:41:28,097 --> 00:41:29,630
Can I think about it?

574
00:41:29,732 --> 00:41:31,432
Of course.

575
00:41:31,534 --> 00:41:32,600
But when we go before the judge,

576
00:41:32,702 --> 00:41:34,936
it has to be "yes" or nothing at all.

577
00:41:35,038 --> 00:41:36,370
You understand?

578
00:41:41,477 --> 00:41:44,378
Where's your associate? My what?

579
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,880
The one who met with my parents.

580
00:41:45,949 --> 00:41:50,051
Oh, she's just... she's in court. Why?

581
00:41:50,153 --> 00:41:52,553
They liked her.

582
00:41:54,424 --> 00:41:56,824
My parents.

583
00:42:03,533 --> 00:42:07,201
(indistinct chatter)

584
00:42:34,631 --> 00:42:36,497
What'd she say?

585
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:41,002
She said he's going to say he did it.

586
00:42:41,104 --> 00:42:43,104
What?

587
00:42:43,206 --> 00:42:45,740
She told him to say it.

588
00:42:47,443 --> 00:42:49,810
Dennis: So, here's my question,

589
00:42:49,913 --> 00:42:54,348
When's the D.A. gonna grow a pair
and actually take a killer to trial?

590
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:56,517
You think it was up to me?

591
00:42:56,619 --> 00:42:59,487
I have a boss who has
a boss who has a boss.

592
00:42:59,589 --> 00:43:02,256
How does it work with you?

593
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:05,860
You're so predictable. And you're not?

594
00:43:05,962 --> 00:43:09,697
(rock music plays)

595
00:43:20,944 --> 00:43:24,845
Give me the Saints in the under.

596
00:43:24,948 --> 00:43:27,114
Why don't you just flush
it down the toilet, John?

597
00:43:27,216 --> 00:43:29,650
The Saints couldn't beat Cooley High.

598
00:43:29,752 --> 00:43:33,220
- You wanna bet?
- Funny, man.

599
00:43:33,323 --> 00:43:36,891
- - Hey, heard about your kid.
What, my son?

600
00:43:36,993 --> 00:43:39,433
- Woman on TV: He was there!
- No, man, your kid, your killer.

601
00:43:39,462 --> 00:43:44,498
He had her blood on his clothes.
He had the murder weapon on him.

602
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,234
- John: Ah. That.
- He tried to escape police custody.

603
00:43:47,337 --> 00:43:50,738
- Listen, I respect the D.A...
- What'd you hear?

604
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,708
The deal. Man, 15 for that?

605
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:58,079
Gift from the gods.
I assume you took it.

606
00:44:00,583 --> 00:44:03,851
Jack and soda.

607
00:44:03,953 --> 00:44:05,753
Oh, hey, John.

608
00:44:05,855 --> 00:44:10,825
Heard about your kid. What
a gift from the gods.

609
00:44:10,927 --> 00:44:13,627
Man: Small money's gonna
tell you, "Take the plea."

610
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:16,197
I got to say, man, the
dude who killed my niece,

611
00:44:16,299 --> 00:44:20,801
he took his chances with the trial.
Next thing, he's walking free.

612
00:44:20,903 --> 00:44:23,938
Now, understood, that's like a
freak of justice or whatever,

613
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:28,009
but if he took what they offered,
he'd be upstate right now,

614
00:44:28,111 --> 00:44:32,213
and I'd be bringing fresh flowers
to my niece's grave.

615
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:42,156
- What was her name?
- Nah.

616
00:44:42,258 --> 00:44:46,660
I can't even bring myself to
say it no more, you know?

617
00:45:02,345 --> 00:45:06,213
You understand what's
gonna happen in there? Yes.

618
00:45:06,315 --> 00:45:09,884
And you're ready to do it? Yes.

619
00:45:09,986 --> 00:45:13,354
I didn't like the sound
of that "yes." Try again.

620
00:45:14,791 --> 00:45:16,557
Yes.

621
00:45:18,594 --> 00:45:21,328
Guard?

622
00:45:22,565 --> 00:45:25,399
Don't move.

623
00:45:27,203 --> 00:45:29,036
Put it down.

624
00:45:29,138 --> 00:45:32,840
Okay, I need you to do something for me.

625
00:45:40,316 --> 00:45:44,285
Officer, I'm here to see the defendant.

626
00:45:47,457 --> 00:45:49,090
Hi. I'm Chandra.

627
00:45:49,192 --> 00:45:52,059
I'm working with Ms. Crowe.

628
00:45:55,598 --> 00:45:58,599
- You okay?
- Not really.

629
00:45:58,701 --> 00:46:00,201
You know what's going on here?

630
00:46:00,303 --> 00:46:04,238
I do. And I know it's
tough, but it's a good deal.

631
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:07,741
You think I'm doing the
right thing to accept it?

632
00:46:07,844 --> 00:46:09,310
Yes.

633
00:46:09,412 --> 00:46:13,013
Well, why would they accept
it if it's good for me?

634
00:46:13,116 --> 00:46:15,516
Trials cost a lot of money.

635
00:46:15,618 --> 00:46:18,786
If they can
reasonably avoid it, they will.

636
00:46:18,855 --> 00:46:21,522
It happens every day.

637
00:46:21,624 --> 00:46:23,958
Thank you.

638
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,960
For?

639
00:46:26,062 --> 00:46:29,797
For just talking to
me like I'm a person.

640
00:46:35,004 --> 00:46:37,171
What would you do?

641
00:46:39,008 --> 00:46:41,509
She told me to come in here
and talk some sense into you,

642
00:46:41,611 --> 00:46:46,714
but if I were you, I
would ask myself one question:

643
00:46:46,816 --> 00:46:49,617
Did I kill her?

644
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:54,088
If the answer is "yes," take the deal.

645
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:56,790
If it's "no"...

646
00:46:59,061 --> 00:47:00,961
don't.

647
00:47:14,544 --> 00:47:18,846
Hey, unless you fuck it up in
there, 15 years is 12 years.

648
00:47:18,948 --> 00:47:21,749
12 years, you still have a chance
of walking out a human being.

649
00:47:21,817 --> 00:47:23,584
Any more than that, no.

650
00:47:23,686 --> 00:47:26,487
You'll be 35 when you get
out, and you'll still have a life.

651
00:47:26,589 --> 00:47:27,888
Take the deal.

652
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:30,491
- It says that I killed her.
- No, it doesn't.

653
00:47:30,593 --> 00:47:34,395
It says you don't trust 12 idiots on a
jury to get it right, and neither do I.

654
00:47:34,497 --> 00:47:38,199
You want to play roulette? Go to
Atlantic City where the odds are better.

655
00:47:38,301 --> 00:47:40,768
My parents will never
know I didn't do it for sure.

656
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:43,337
They don't know that now.

657
00:47:46,442 --> 00:47:51,612
Naz, I'd kill to be 35 again.

658
00:47:51,714 --> 00:47:53,314
Take the deal.

659
00:47:55,051 --> 00:47:57,418
Bailiff: All rise.

660
00:48:05,995 --> 00:48:08,495
All right.

661
00:48:08,598 --> 00:48:11,999
I understand that in an
exchange for a plea of guilty,

662
00:48:12,101 --> 00:48:15,636
the people are offering to
downgrade the charge of murder one

663
00:48:15,738 --> 00:48:19,240
to manslaughter one with
a sentence of 15 years.

664
00:48:19,342 --> 00:48:22,042
Is that your understanding
of the agreement, Ms. Crowe?

665
00:48:22,144 --> 00:48:26,146
It is, Your Honor. Mr. Khan,
is that your understanding?

666
00:48:26,249 --> 00:48:28,349
- Yes.
- All right.

667
00:48:28,451 --> 00:48:30,351
You're gonna be
asked a series of questions

668
00:48:30,453 --> 00:48:31,986
by the district attorney.

669
00:48:32,088 --> 00:48:34,655
If at any time you
don't understand what's being

670
00:48:34,757 --> 00:48:38,592
asked of you or you have any
need for clarification,

671
00:48:38,694 --> 00:48:41,895
feel free to interrupt and
ask any question, okay?

672
00:48:41,998 --> 00:48:45,299
- Okay.
- Bailiff: Defendant, please rise.

673
00:48:48,904 --> 00:48:50,838
Raise your right hand.

674
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:53,741
Do you swear or affirm to
tell the truth, the whole truth,

675
00:48:53,843 --> 00:48:57,311
- and nothing but the truth?
- I do.

676
00:49:01,117 --> 00:49:05,452
Have you spoken with your lawyer
before making this application?

677
00:49:05,554 --> 00:49:06,920
Yes.

678
00:49:06,989 --> 00:49:08,956
Have you taken any drugs or alcohol

679
00:49:09,058 --> 00:49:10,991
or anything else that
would affect your ability

680
00:49:11,093 --> 00:49:13,961
- to understand these proceedings today?
- No.

681
00:49:14,063 --> 00:49:17,865
Do you understand that pleading
guilty is the same as going to trial

682
00:49:17,967 --> 00:49:21,001
and being convicted of
manslaughter in the first degree?

683
00:49:21,103 --> 00:49:24,138
Yes. You understand that
by pleading guilty today,

684
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,640
you are giving up your
right to cross-examination

685
00:49:26,742 --> 00:49:31,045
or to call witnesses to testify
on your behalf in front of a jury?

686
00:49:31,147 --> 00:49:35,182
Yes. Do you understand
that by pleading guilty,

687
00:49:35,284 --> 00:49:40,054
you give up your right to
appeal to a higher court? Yes.

688
00:49:40,156 --> 00:49:45,626
Are you pleading guilty because
you are, in fact, guilty?

689
00:49:51,634 --> 00:49:54,168
Yes.

690
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:57,971
In your own words, then,

691
00:49:58,074 --> 00:50:01,575
tell us what happened on
the night of October 24th.

692
00:50:01,677 --> 00:50:05,979
I left my parents'
house in my father's taxi

693
00:50:06,082 --> 00:50:08,515
to go to a party in Manhattan.

694
00:50:08,617 --> 00:50:11,318
I got lost.

695
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,754
And Andrea got into the back of the cab,

696
00:50:13,856 --> 00:50:16,790
thinking I was a real cab driver.

697
00:50:16,892 --> 00:50:19,360
We drove uptown. We talked.

698
00:50:19,462 --> 00:50:22,229
She gave me
something, some... some pill.

699
00:50:22,331 --> 00:50:26,367
We went back to her place, and we drank.

700
00:50:26,469 --> 00:50:29,670
She gave me something else, some powder.

701
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,208
We, uh... we went up to her bedroom.

702
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:37,144
We had sex.

703
00:50:37,246 --> 00:50:39,680
And then?

704
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,400
And then...

705
00:51:00,336 --> 00:51:04,671
(soft panting)

706
00:51:04,774 --> 00:51:10,210
Then I fell asleep and
woke up in the kitchen.

707
00:51:10,312 --> 00:51:12,813
I went back up to the bedroom

708
00:51:12,915 --> 00:51:17,618
to get my clothes and say goodbye.

709
00:51:19,355 --> 00:51:21,522
Then I went to her...

710
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:26,860
and I saw that she was dead.

711
00:51:31,867 --> 00:51:34,268
I... I panicked. I ran.

712
00:51:35,771 --> 00:51:37,404
And?

713
00:51:37,506 --> 00:51:39,973
And, uh...

714
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:47,714
(floorboards creaking)

715
00:51:53,088 --> 00:51:56,223
That's all I remember.

716
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:02,463
(whispering) Are you kidding me?

717
00:52:02,565 --> 00:52:06,099
Are you kidding me?

718
00:52:08,737 --> 00:52:11,505
Ask him again.

719
00:52:11,607 --> 00:52:14,475
You drank, took drugs,

720
00:52:14,577 --> 00:52:17,311
had sex, and...

721
00:52:19,715 --> 00:52:20,881
killed her.

722
00:52:20,983 --> 00:52:23,450
No. No, I didn't.

723
00:52:26,355 --> 00:52:28,822
Then what the hell are
you pleading guilty to?

724
00:52:30,593 --> 00:52:34,561
Okay. What else we got here today?

725
00:52:34,663 --> 00:52:37,231
Alison: You are an idiot.
You have fucked yourself.

726
00:52:37,333 --> 00:52:40,067
Right now, out there, that
prosecutor, that sweet lady,

727
00:52:40,169 --> 00:52:42,536
is sharpening her knife, and
the judge is gonna help her

728
00:52:42,638 --> 00:52:44,905
murder you for making them go to trial.

729
00:52:45,007 --> 00:52:47,441
And, frankly, I feel like
killing you myself.

730
00:52:47,543 --> 00:52:49,943
- So quit.
- What?

731
00:52:50,045 --> 00:52:54,681
- What did you say?
- Quit.

732
00:52:54,783 --> 00:52:56,884
I should.

733
00:52:58,888 --> 00:53:02,256
In fact, I do. I quit.

734
00:53:02,358 --> 00:53:04,191
Gate.

735
00:53:20,843 --> 00:53:23,911
Alison: My firm will continue to
work for your son's exoneration,

736
00:53:24,013 --> 00:53:26,079
but two things will change.

737
00:53:26,181 --> 00:53:29,650
Nasir's primary attorney
will now be Ms. Kapoor,

738
00:53:29,752 --> 00:53:33,320
and given that we're now
facing what will be a complex trial,

739
00:53:33,422 --> 00:53:38,559
I can no longer offer
you our services pro bono.

740
00:53:41,897 --> 00:53:46,266
Of course, you're free to decline
and seek counsel elsewhere.

741
00:53:47,803 --> 00:53:49,703
(rock music playing)

742
00:53:49,805 --> 00:53:52,406
(line ringing)

743
00:53:55,911 --> 00:53:57,544
- Man on phone: Westside Animal.
- Yeah.

744
00:53:57,646 --> 00:54:00,380
I'm, uh, calling about a cat.

745
00:54:00,482 --> 00:54:04,985
It's an ugly sort of orange thing.

746
00:54:05,087 --> 00:54:06,753
Man: Are you the guy with the feet?

747
00:54:06,855 --> 00:54:08,288
Right. The guy with the feet.

748
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:10,390
That's me.

749
00:54:10,492 --> 00:54:12,926
Yeah. I'll hold.

750
00:54:13,028 --> 00:54:18,465
(dogs barking)

751
00:54:27,476 --> 00:54:29,610
- Man: It's still here.
- It's still there?

752
00:54:29,712 --> 00:54:33,146
- Man: You want him?
- No, I don't want it.

753
00:54:33,248 --> 00:54:34,748
I'm just, you know, checking.

754
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:38,385
- Man: Okay.
- Okay? Thanks.

755
00:54:43,192 --> 00:54:44,992
Man: You stuck to your guns.

756
00:54:45,961 --> 00:54:47,794
That's good.

757
00:54:47,896 --> 00:54:49,630
That's rare.

758
00:54:49,732 --> 00:54:53,233
Maybe you'll get lucky, and the
judge will screw up with you, too.

759
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:56,637
Well, I didn't take the
plea 'cause I didn't do it.

760
00:54:56,739 --> 00:54:58,238
Yeah.

761
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:03,577
That's what he said, too,
my niece's killer.

762
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:07,347
You didn't do it. He didn't do it.

763
00:55:07,449 --> 00:55:10,450
I guess don't nobody do shit, huh?

764
00:55:10,552 --> 00:55:14,054
This joint is so chock-a-block
with "I didn't do it" motherfuckers,

765
00:55:14,156 --> 00:55:17,124
they falling from the rafters.

766
00:55:20,696 --> 00:55:23,196
Charlene.

767
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,802
- What?
- My niece.

768
00:55:28,904 --> 00:55:31,772
Her name was Charlene.

769
00:55:32,975 --> 00:55:37,611
And this... this is for her.

770
00:55:37,713 --> 00:55:42,249
(gasping) Fuck! Fuck!

771
00:55:42,351 --> 00:55:46,086
(groaning)

772
00:55:46,188 --> 00:55:48,388
(inhales sharply)

773
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:50,290
Who was it?

774
00:55:50,392 --> 00:55:53,827
I don't know. It was dark.

775
00:55:53,962 --> 00:55:56,663
I asked you a question.

776
00:55:56,765 --> 00:55:58,999
I answered it.

777
00:56:29,665 --> 00:56:32,032
(chuckles)

778
00:56:48,183 --> 00:56:51,284
(inaudible)

779
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:37,964
(keys jingling)

780
00:57:48,177 --> 00:57:51,511
Say the words for me, Nasir.

781
00:57:53,882 --> 00:57:56,283
I need your help.

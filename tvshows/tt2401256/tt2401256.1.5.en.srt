Anchorwoman: <i>The mayor and
police commissioner met</i>

00:01:39,521 --> 00:01:42,655
<i>with religious and community leaders
at the Al-Khoei Islamic Center.</i>

6
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,224
<i>The Islamic Center was one of five
places firebombed Sunday night.</i>

7
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,928
<i>So far, the police are questioning
a 40-year-old Jamaica, Queens man.</i>

8
00:01:49,963 --> 00:01:54,399
<i>He was taken into custody as he walked
to a car with Virginia license plates.</i>

9
00:01:54,435 --> 00:01:55,835
<i>The police say he fit
the description...</i>

10
00:01:55,835 --> 00:01:56,701
Stone: <i>Yeah.</i>

11
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:01,573
<i>You know, and, uh, when you go
to trial, right, it's like, uh...</i>

12
00:02:01,608 --> 00:02:04,542
<i>it's kind of like quantum
physics. You know what I mean?</i>

13
00:02:04,578 --> 00:02:06,911
<i>You're controlling time and space.</i>

14
00:02:06,947 --> 00:02:08,613
Something that
happened out of sequence...

15
00:02:08,648 --> 00:02:11,415
You're trying to make
it happen in real time,

16
00:02:11,451 --> 00:02:13,851
give it a certain kind of analysis.

17
00:02:13,887 --> 00:02:16,554
(Saran Wrap crackles)

18
00:02:19,158 --> 00:02:21,492
- So you put criminals in jail?
- No.

19
00:02:21,527 --> 00:02:24,395
In fact, I, uh, kind of do the opposite.

20
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,663
I try to keep them out of jail.

21
00:02:30,936 --> 00:02:33,904
Let's say your brother or
your cousin gets arrested

22
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:38,274
because he looks like someone who
robbed a store, but it wasn't him.

23
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,543
Well, what if it was him?

24
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:44,347
He's still entitled to the
best defense he can get.

25
00:02:44,382 --> 00:02:47,350
- And that's you?
- (laughter)

26
00:02:48,821 --> 00:02:52,155
My dad actually puts them
away. He's a deputy inspector.

27
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,556
So was mine.

28
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:56,426
You can imagine how
disappointed he was in me.

29
00:02:57,762 --> 00:02:59,262
Would you defend Hitler?

30
00:03:00,632 --> 00:03:04,634
In theory, it'd be my duty
as an officer of the court.

31
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:06,869
He killed my great-grandparents.

32
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:12,608
You want to jump in here anytime soon?

33
00:03:12,644 --> 00:03:14,844
No. This is great.

34
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,446
Great.

35
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,916
Yeah, Hitler. Uh...

36
00:03:25,856 --> 00:03:29,424
It was just disrespectful.

37
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,093
You came in on a workday. You
could've been making money.

38
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:36,165
- It's no big deal. They're just kids.
- They're assholes.

39
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,533
Well...

40
00:03:40,103 --> 00:03:42,403
You could've worn shoes, though.

41
00:03:43,373 --> 00:03:46,240
I'm afraid those days are gone.

42
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:50,779

43
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,247
(loud chattering)

44
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,306
Thank you.

45
00:04:19,341 --> 00:04:21,241
You're welcome.

46
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,283
(horns honking)

47
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,420
(Stone humming)

48
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:41,794
Hi.

49
00:04:43,432 --> 00:04:47,266
(keys jingling, door opens)

50
00:04:50,705 --> 00:04:53,172
Here. Come on.

51
00:05:20,968 --> 00:05:22,968
She's withdrawn from the case.

52
00:05:23,003 --> 00:05:25,971
She's assigned it to me
and doesn't want anybody

53
00:05:26,006 --> 00:05:27,605
from the firm spending time on it,

54
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:30,475
so I'm looking outside it for some help.

55
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,677
Fifty grand.

56
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:34,712
I'm authorized to spend no more than 20.

57
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:37,815
Then it's not gonna work.
It goes to trial, it's, uh,

58
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,919
two, three months of my
life. It's not enough.

59
00:05:41,954 --> 00:05:47,124
Last year, you billed for 60
grand, basically in $250 increments,

60
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,627
45 percent of which is uncollected.

61
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:52,963
That was for the year. This
is for a month or two.

62
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:54,832
It's more than fair.

63
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:58,769
Two or three months, I
said, not one or two.

64
00:05:59,772 --> 00:06:02,239
And where's the money coming from?

65
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:04,374
I'm sure his parents don't have it.

66
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,043
They'll have to get it.

67
00:06:06,078 --> 00:06:08,578
Beg, borrow, steal, whatever.

68
00:06:08,614 --> 00:06:11,848
- From who?
- The risk we take.

69
00:06:11,883 --> 00:06:14,117
No. The risk you take,

70
00:06:14,152 --> 00:06:16,085
because the only way I'll do this

71
00:06:16,121 --> 00:06:19,289
is if you pay me directly and in full.

72
00:06:19,325 --> 00:06:22,158
What you get from them or
don't get from them is your problem.

73
00:06:22,194 --> 00:06:25,361
I'm paid. Are you authorized to do that?

74
00:06:26,198 --> 00:06:28,264
If I am, you'll do it for 20?

75
00:06:29,634 --> 00:06:30,934
Thirty-five.

76
00:06:31,803 --> 00:06:34,637
- Twenty-five.
- Thirty.

77
00:06:37,843 --> 00:06:38,908
Okay.

78
00:06:38,944 --> 00:06:40,710
In writing.

79
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:43,245
Okay.

80
00:06:49,253 --> 00:06:52,254
Weiss: Prints, blood, semen, witnesses.

81
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:55,190
So we have everything
and they have nothing.

82
00:06:55,226 --> 00:06:58,293
What do you do when you have nothing?

83
00:06:58,329 --> 00:06:59,561
Plea.

84
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:03,098
They had their chance and didn't.

85
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:05,133
Go for insanity.

86
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:07,102
I wouldn't, neither will they.

87
00:07:07,137 --> 00:07:08,703
Woman: Blame someone else.

88
00:07:08,739 --> 00:07:11,240
Someone else had that
knife in their pocket?

89
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:13,441
Man: Some violation of his rights.

90
00:07:13,477 --> 00:07:16,177
There were none.

91
00:07:16,212 --> 00:07:20,915
If it were me, I'd focus
on one thing, the drugs.

92
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,385
She drugged him. He's not responsible.

93
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,988
That's no defense. They
don't know who gave who what.

94
00:07:27,023 --> 00:07:29,657
They'll try to find out.

95
00:07:44,374 --> 00:07:47,508
- What's ketamine?
- Why?

96
00:07:47,543 --> 00:07:50,811
It's what was in the
vial he had in his pocket.

97
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:54,615
It's an anesthetic vets use on
horses when they do surgery.

98
00:07:55,951 --> 00:07:57,684
Why would anybody take that?

99
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,988
Why would Michael Jackson
take propofol? Same reason.

100
00:08:03,825 --> 00:08:05,858
He took it to sleep, didn't he?

101
00:08:05,894 --> 00:08:08,328
Well, it worked for that.

102
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:17,003
You take ketamine because...

103
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:21,841
before it knocks you out,

104
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:25,611
you, you get a feeling,
like... like, uh...

105
00:08:25,647 --> 00:08:28,581
like you just want to fuck... I...

106
00:08:28,616 --> 00:08:33,419
(chuckles) I don't... I don't know
how to say this to you, Chandra.

107
00:08:33,455 --> 00:08:34,313
An aphrodisiac?

108
00:08:34,338 --> 00:08:36,912
There you go. That's
the polite word for it.

109
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:39,858
Then it, what, knocks you out?

110
00:08:39,893 --> 00:08:42,694
Yeah, like the horse, unless
you mix it with coke,

111
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:45,697
meth, whatever, take the
edge off, so to speak.

112
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,667
We need to show it was hers,

113
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:52,271
she gave it to him,
and where she got it.

114
00:08:55,943 --> 00:08:57,476
(Stone sighs)

115
00:08:57,511 --> 00:09:00,111
How do you know all this drug stuff?

116
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,448
I'm a lawyer.

117
00:09:04,485 --> 00:09:07,318
I heard you're putting in your papers.

118
00:09:07,354 --> 00:09:10,288
Thirty-three years. Enough is enough.

119
00:09:10,323 --> 00:09:12,490
What are you gonna do with yourself?

120
00:09:12,525 --> 00:09:14,692
Easier to say what I'm not gonna do.

121
00:09:14,727 --> 00:09:17,761
I'm not gonna spend more
time with the family or open a bar

122
00:09:17,797 --> 00:09:20,898
or move to Florida and get a
commercial fishing license.

123
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:24,802
So, what's left? Golf.

124
00:09:24,837 --> 00:09:27,270
Can we talk about something else?

125
00:09:28,641 --> 00:09:30,908
Lock in the kid's night for me,

126
00:09:30,943 --> 00:09:32,776
from point A to point B,

127
00:09:32,812 --> 00:09:35,779
from when he left his
house to when he was picked up.

128
00:09:35,815 --> 00:09:37,581
Fine.

129
00:09:37,617 --> 00:09:40,651
♪ ♪

132
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,563
- Coffee?
- No.

133
00:09:56,068 --> 00:09:57,901
We really need our cab back.

134
00:09:57,936 --> 00:10:00,670
I know. Then you'll do it?

135
00:10:00,705 --> 00:10:03,873
- Do what?
- File charges like the man said.

136
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:05,241
What? No.

137
00:10:06,244 --> 00:10:07,810
Then what do we do?

138
00:10:09,347 --> 00:10:11,614
Salim, he is facing life in prison.

139
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,817
What's a couple more
years? I'd do it for you.

140
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:17,420
No, you wouldn't.

141
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:20,722
We are asking you out of respect.

142
00:10:20,758 --> 00:10:24,527
You're respectfully asking me to
charge my son with grand theft.

143
00:10:24,562 --> 00:10:27,463
He took the cab. He didn't
have your permission.

144
00:10:27,498 --> 00:10:30,999
He didn't have our permission,
and if they ask us at his trial,

145
00:10:31,035 --> 00:10:33,001
we will say he didn't because it's true.

146
00:10:33,037 --> 00:10:35,403
My son is innocent. Innocent, guilty...

147
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:38,139
We don't have it, and we
aren't getting it back.

148
00:10:38,175 --> 00:10:42,343
Is that our fault? Did
our son do something wrong?

What the fuck, Osama? This

It's your turn. Get your shots in.

Yeah, that's right. Walk
with your bitch ass.

158
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:13,766
You're lucky. I was going for
your face, you fucking faggot.

159
00:12:16,137 --> 00:12:17,469
Yeah.

saw a figure, who he can't describe,

377

go in, then come out a minute later
wearing a jacket and run to the taxi.

378
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:15,463
Right, like he forgot it
and had to go back inside.

Yeah.

380
00:32:17,567 --> 00:32:20,835
So I'm thinking, okay,
he broke the door pane,

381
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:23,137
reached in to unlock the door.

382
00:32:23,172 --> 00:32:24,538
And is that...

383
00:32:24,573 --> 00:32:27,808
Is that how he got this
cut on his hand or...?

I don't think I do.

You're stabbing somebody with a knife.

388
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:45,992
Sometimes it goes so deep, it hits bone,

389
00:32:46,027 --> 00:32:49,028
which causes your hand
to slip onto the blade.

390
00:32:49,064 --> 00:32:53,399
But it only slips once, even though
you stabbed her 22 times.

391
00:32:53,434 --> 00:32:55,101
How common would that be?

392

I'm asking, Harry, not telling.

394

The question is, can it be
determined if this wound

395
00:33:07,648 --> 00:33:11,250
resulted from cutting
himself on a piece of broken glass

396
00:33:11,285 --> 00:33:13,519
or on the blade of a knife?

398
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:20,860

Will I have to say?

00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:26,765
Yeah.

402
00:33:28,668 --> 00:33:32,237
This cut was the result of his hand
slipping from the handle of the knife

403
00:33:32,273 --> 00:33:35,440
onto the blade of the
knife in the act of stabbing her.

00:39:42,764 --> 00:39:45,197
(cat toys jangling)

484
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:48,334
I'm going out.

485
00:39:50,372 --> 00:39:52,872
I got a life, you know.

486
00:39:57,344 --> 00:40:00,846
You look good, baby.

487
00:40:00,882 --> 00:40:04,349
You are so much
trouble, and I love trouble.

488
00:40:04,385 --> 00:40:08,987
Hey. Buy you a drink? Excuse us.

489
00:40:09,022 --> 00:40:11,556
What are you doing here?

490
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:16,094
Buying you a drink. Joseph, champagne.

491
00:40:16,129 --> 00:40:18,430
Joseph: Coming up. Would
you excuse us, please?

492
00:40:18,465 --> 00:40:20,131
Please? Huh? Come on.

493
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,066
Excuse us, all right? Just... Come on.

494
00:40:22,102 --> 00:40:24,735
Beat it, huh? Get the
fuck out of here, all right?

495
00:40:24,771 --> 00:40:28,606
Johnny, I am working, obviously.

496
00:40:28,641 --> 00:40:30,208
I know. I know. I know it's weird.

497
00:40:30,243 --> 00:40:33,778
We don't do this, but this
is a very special occasion.

498
00:40:33,814 --> 00:40:36,681
(chuckling) It's... It's special, okay?

499
00:40:36,716 --> 00:40:39,750
I am ready for
you... thank you ...big time.

500
00:40:39,786 --> 00:40:42,353
It's not gonna be
like the other night, okay?

501
00:40:42,388 --> 00:40:44,054
There's not gonna be a repeat of that.

502
00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:46,256
Hello, stranger. I've got to have...

503
00:40:46,292 --> 00:40:48,726
Excuse me. Oh, well,
look who's back in town.

504
00:40:48,761 --> 00:40:50,528
He is, indeed. Excuse us.

505
00:40:50,563 --> 00:40:54,632
- And you look good, baby.
- Oh. You look gorgeous.

506
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:57,600
Baby, a sight for sore eyes.
What you got here? Champagne?

507
00:40:57,636 --> 00:41:01,972
Now, here's to us. You
think of everything.

508
00:41:02,007 --> 00:41:05,508
Here's to the good
life. Just the two of us.

509
00:41:05,544 --> 00:41:11,514
Woman: You are so much
trouble, and I love trouble.

510
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:14,884
You're a lot of
trouble... (mutters) God.

511
00:41:14,919 --> 00:41:17,253
God, help me.

512
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:21,257
The dreaded tox reports.

513
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:27,330
Alcohol, ketamine, MDMA in both,

514
00:41:27,366 --> 00:41:31,467
and amphetamine in him, not her.

515
00:41:31,502 --> 00:41:35,604
- You're kidding.
- Nope.

516
00:41:42,247 --> 00:41:44,480
This has to be a mistake.

517
00:41:44,515 --> 00:41:48,950
Why? Because you don't like
being lied to? I don't.

518
00:41:48,986 --> 00:41:51,787
Is there some way to determine
what kind of amphetamine it is?

519
00:41:51,822 --> 00:41:57,259
What difference does it make? Speed
is speed in court. Lies are lies.

520
00:41:57,294 --> 00:41:59,628
Why would he do that?

521
00:41:59,663 --> 00:42:01,630
Because we don't know him.

522
00:42:09,439 --> 00:42:11,839
(metal clanking)

523
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,147
(sniffs)

524
00:42:26,823 --> 00:42:29,891
(coughing)

525
00:42:35,131 --> 00:42:37,031
Fuck.

526
00:42:54,282 --> 00:42:58,117
- I wish you hadn't done that.
- What?

527
00:42:58,153 --> 00:43:01,354
Stone: Your skull. What do
you think I'm talking about?

528
00:43:06,294 --> 00:43:08,094
The tox screens came in.

529
00:43:08,129 --> 00:43:10,629
So, what did she give me?

530
00:43:10,665 --> 00:43:13,899
Stone: What do you think? Ecstasy, coke.

531
00:43:13,935 --> 00:43:16,869
It was "K" in the vial, not coke.

532
00:43:16,904 --> 00:43:18,737
You know what that is, ketamine?

533
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,213
Anything else you want to tell us?

534
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:30,783
What do you mean?

535
00:43:30,818 --> 00:43:33,251
What you took that night.

536
00:43:34,789 --> 00:43:36,154
I didn't take anything.

537
00:43:36,991 --> 00:43:39,124
Dexedrine, Benzedrine, Adderall,

538
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:41,961
meth, some, or all of
the above. What was it?

539
00:43:41,996 --> 00:43:43,528
Nasir: I didn't take any of that.

540
00:43:43,563 --> 00:43:46,064
The screen is wrong, that's
what you're saying?

541
00:43:46,967 --> 00:43:47,899
What does it say?

542
00:43:47,934 --> 00:43:50,802
I just told you, speed in you, not her.

543
00:43:51,905 --> 00:43:53,538
Well, what about my inhaler?

544
00:43:53,573 --> 00:43:54,873
That's steroids,

545
00:43:54,908 --> 00:43:57,409
not amphetamines, not anymore.

546
00:43:57,444 --> 00:43:59,777
That stopped before you were born.

547
00:43:59,813 --> 00:44:02,246
Nasir: Isn't there
amphetamine in Ecstasy?

548
00:44:02,281 --> 00:44:05,617
What, are you a chemist
now? How would you know that?

549
00:44:05,652 --> 00:44:07,284
I don't. I'm asking.

550
00:44:09,589 --> 00:44:11,255
You're lying.

551
00:44:14,761 --> 00:44:16,693
My guess is Adderall.

552
00:44:16,729 --> 00:44:19,196
What college kid
doesn't take it? Am I right?

553
00:44:23,169 --> 00:44:26,303
You think that makes it okay? It's not.

554
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:28,506
Let me explain to you why.

555
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:32,308
One, without a
prescription, it's illegal.

556
00:44:32,344 --> 00:44:36,079
Two, you weren't up studying.
You were going to a party.

557
00:44:36,114 --> 00:44:41,351
Three, it counteracts the
sedative effects of the "K,"

558
00:44:41,386 --> 00:44:45,455
making your "I passed
out" story less believable.

559
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:46,456
It's not a story.

560
00:44:46,491 --> 00:44:48,658
Four, you take enough,
it makes you psychotic.

561
00:44:48,693 --> 00:44:51,027
Five, you lied to me.

562
00:44:52,764 --> 00:44:57,467
So I'm gonna ask you
because your life depends upon it:

563
00:44:57,502 --> 00:45:00,937
What else have you lied about?

564
00:45:00,972 --> 00:45:02,872
Nothing.

565
00:45:02,907 --> 00:45:07,242
Everything you say happened, happened?
- Yes.

566
00:45:07,278 --> 00:45:13,082
Stone: She got in the
cab. You drove uptown.

567
00:45:13,117 --> 00:45:17,419
You stopped and bought
beer because she asked you to.

568
00:45:17,455 --> 00:45:22,491
You went to the river where she gave
you the "E," not the other way around.

569
00:45:22,526 --> 00:45:26,828
You drove to her place, had
words with that guy on the street.

570
00:45:26,863 --> 00:45:29,231
- You went inside...
- "Guys." You said "guy."

571
00:45:29,266 --> 00:45:33,268
There was two of them, him and
another guy. They were together.

572
00:45:36,607 --> 00:45:39,941
Now, I don't know why
you'd lie about that.

573
00:45:41,011 --> 00:45:43,411
But are you lying about that?

574
00:45:50,754 --> 00:45:52,921
Why would the guy lie about it?

575
00:45:52,956 --> 00:45:55,055
I don't know. Ask him.

576
00:45:55,091 --> 00:45:57,325
What did this other guy say or do?

577
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,727
Nothing. He just stood there.

578
00:45:59,762 --> 00:46:01,695
(gags)

579
00:46:03,466 --> 00:46:04,798
I got to get back. Tito!

580
00:46:06,035 --> 00:46:07,768
Naz.

581
00:46:07,803 --> 00:46:10,338
Naz, I understand you have to do it,

582
00:46:10,373 --> 00:46:13,040
but if you're caught for this...

583
00:46:15,177 --> 00:46:17,845
the case is over,

584
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,547
and you're never getting out of here.

585
00:46:40,101 --> 00:46:44,637
(Nasir breathing heavily, grunting)

586
00:46:49,243 --> 00:46:51,577
Ah!

587
00:46:54,615 --> 00:46:57,116
Ah! Yeah.

588
00:46:59,253 --> 00:47:01,453
You get it?

589
00:47:02,756 --> 00:47:04,590
C'est fini, motherfucker.

590
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:06,659
Yo, there's four.

591
00:47:06,694 --> 00:47:08,394
I wish.

592
00:47:08,429 --> 00:47:10,796
No, there's f... I swallowed four.

593
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:14,366
Petey? Four.

594
00:47:14,402 --> 00:47:17,202
So get it out of me, man.

595
00:47:17,237 --> 00:47:20,438
You get it out of
you, motherfucker. (laughs)

596
00:47:24,578 --> 00:47:27,045
Naz, relax.

597
00:47:27,081 --> 00:47:29,047
It's cool. It'll come.

598
00:47:32,586 --> 00:47:35,520
Nasir: What the fuck you looking at?

599
00:47:40,927 --> 00:47:43,060
<i>What was the question, again?</i>

600
00:47:43,096 --> 00:47:45,796
<i>What time it was when you
saw them, as you put it,</i>

601
00:47:45,832 --> 00:47:48,799
<i>"rubbing up against each other."</i>

602
00:47:48,835 --> 00:47:53,237
<i>I want to say 10,
11, something like that.</i>

603
00:47:53,272 --> 00:47:56,774
<i>- You were alone?
- Yeah.</i>

604
00:47:56,809 --> 00:48:00,244
(rewinding)

605
00:48:01,513 --> 00:48:05,315
<i>I want to say 10,
11, something like that.</i>

606
00:48:05,351 --> 00:48:09,319
<i>- You were alone?
- Yeah.</i>

607
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:13,156
He's lying.

608
00:48:32,911 --> 00:48:34,911
How's it going?

609
00:48:37,315 --> 00:48:39,882
John Stone.

610
00:48:40,818 --> 00:48:42,451
Hey, I recognize you.

611
00:48:42,487 --> 00:48:44,320
You're the guy from the subway ads.

612
00:48:44,355 --> 00:48:46,199
- "No fee till you're free," right?
- That's me.

613
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:49,825
Yeah. (laughs) Yeah. Hey, is that true?

614
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:53,362
Not exactly, but my
rates are reasonable.

615
00:48:53,398 --> 00:48:56,999
Yeah, well, that's a good
one, man. That's a good slogan.

616
00:48:57,034 --> 00:48:58,867
Thank you.

617
00:49:00,004 --> 00:49:03,637
Here. You never know.

618
00:49:06,709 --> 00:49:11,545
Actually, you could,
uh, use one now... a lawyer.

619
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:14,448
(scoffs) What the
fuck I need a lawyer for?

620
00:49:14,483 --> 00:49:17,819
Keep you out of jail for perjury.

621
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:19,853
What you talking about, man?

622
00:49:19,888 --> 00:49:22,823
That couple you saw on the
street, you exchanged words with,

623
00:49:22,858 --> 00:49:25,793
something about "Mustafa, bombs," so on.

624
00:49:25,828 --> 00:49:27,260
All right, that's free speech.

625
00:49:27,296 --> 00:49:30,931
But you said you were
alone, that's not all right.

626
00:49:30,966 --> 00:49:33,767
That's a legal problem there.

627
00:49:33,803 --> 00:49:36,569
I'd look into this
problem for you, but I can't

628
00:49:36,604 --> 00:49:40,173
since I'm representing Mustafa.

629
00:49:40,209 --> 00:49:42,242
Trevor. Trevor.

630
00:49:42,277 --> 00:49:44,044
It is Trevor, am I right?

631
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,213
I'm trying to help you here.

632
00:49:46,248 --> 00:49:49,227
Oh, you're trying to help me, with your
fucking rags and your gloves on, right?

633
00:49:49,251 --> 00:49:50,877
Seriously, who are you
supposed to be, Michael

634
00:49:50,901 --> 00:49:52,363
Jackson or Mickey Mouse
with those gloves?

635
00:49:52,387 --> 00:49:53,897
Don't worry about it. That's my problem.

636
00:49:53,921 --> 00:49:56,055
We need to talk about your problem.

637
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:58,558
Hey, it's out of service.

638
00:49:58,593 --> 00:50:00,393
Who is he?

639
00:50:00,428 --> 00:50:03,295
Trevor, I know you were with someone.

640
00:50:03,331 --> 00:50:05,398
Hey, would you lower your voice, man?

641
00:50:05,433 --> 00:50:08,700
Okay? I don't know
him. I don't know the dude.

642
00:50:08,736 --> 00:50:11,414
You don't know him, but you were
walking down the street talking to him?

643
00:50:11,438 --> 00:50:13,638
I'm standing here talking to
you, and I don't know you.

644
00:50:13,674 --> 00:50:15,307
You know my name because I told you.

645
00:50:15,343 --> 00:50:16,942
He didn't tell you his? Come on.

646
00:50:16,978 --> 00:50:19,111
Nope. Nope, nope. I don't believe you.

647
00:50:19,146 --> 00:50:21,847
What the fuck do I
care? I just told you why.

648
00:50:21,883 --> 00:50:24,216
Your false statement was used
to get the indictment.

649
00:50:24,252 --> 00:50:27,652
That's five years and
$10,000 in New York, no shit.

650
00:50:27,688 --> 00:50:30,355
Look, man, seriously, what is
wrong with you to come down here

651
00:50:30,391 --> 00:50:33,492
and ask me to bang on a
brother in front of all these people?

652
00:50:33,527 --> 00:50:36,194
They can't hear us. Yeah,
but they can see us.

653
00:50:36,229 --> 00:50:40,399
Hey, if there's one thing I
don't look like, it's a cop.

654
00:50:40,434 --> 00:50:42,183
- Am I right?
- Yeah. You look

655
00:50:42,208 --> 00:50:44,269
like a fucking homeless dude.

656
00:50:44,304 --> 00:50:46,204
There you go!

657
00:50:59,652 --> 00:51:03,020
- Duane.
- Duane what?

658
00:51:03,055 --> 00:51:04,221
Don't know.

659
00:51:04,256 --> 00:51:06,557
- You're gonna lie to me now?
- Lie to you?

660
00:51:06,592 --> 00:51:10,661
I don't even want to be fucking
near you, whatever the fuck you got.

661
00:51:10,696 --> 00:51:13,263
It's not contagious.

662
00:51:14,633 --> 00:51:18,802
All right, so I'm all focused
on him right now,

663
00:51:18,837 --> 00:51:22,539
this Duane... whatever
the fuck his last name is.

664
00:51:22,574 --> 00:51:25,875
But I could just as easily focus on you,

665
00:51:25,911 --> 00:51:29,679
where you went after you
had this altercation

666
00:51:29,714 --> 00:51:33,282
outside a house two hours
later is covered in blood.

667
00:51:33,318 --> 00:51:35,318
- I went home.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

668
00:51:35,353 --> 00:51:36,512
I did.

669
00:51:36,537 --> 00:51:39,989
Trevor, after 9/11,
two things happened.

670
00:51:40,024 --> 00:51:42,358
You started calling guys "Abdul Fazul,"

671
00:51:42,393 --> 00:51:47,296
and Homeland Security started
putting up cameras everywhere.

672
00:51:47,332 --> 00:51:49,932
You didn't go home.

673
00:51:53,504 --> 00:51:55,871
You afraid of him?

674
00:51:57,141 --> 00:51:59,608
Is that what's going on here?

675
00:52:00,478 --> 00:52:03,145
Why are you afraid of him?

676
00:52:03,181 --> 00:52:05,747
He's a violent guy, this Duane?

677
00:52:10,955 --> 00:52:12,220
Reade.

678
00:52:12,255 --> 00:52:14,523
Reade?

679
00:52:14,558 --> 00:52:16,925
Duane Reade?

680
00:52:25,902 --> 00:52:27,935
All right.

681
00:52:27,971 --> 00:52:30,905
- I'll see you on the stand.
- What?

682
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:33,608
Because you're a witness
in the murder case

683
00:52:33,643 --> 00:52:35,676
or you're a suspect in the murder case.

684
00:52:35,712 --> 00:52:37,778
We'll see which it is.

685
00:52:37,814 --> 00:52:39,825
What? I mean, that's his
name. What do you want from me?

686
00:52:39,849 --> 00:52:40,726
I didn't name him.

687
00:52:40,751 --> 00:52:43,017
It's a wild coincidence
the pharmacy's there?

688
00:52:43,052 --> 00:52:44,030
I didn't put it there.

689
00:52:44,055 --> 00:52:45,853
Duane Reade, you're
sticking with that?

690
00:52:45,889 --> 00:52:47,822
You're sure? Man, that's the truth.

691
00:52:47,857 --> 00:52:50,324
Fine. Is there anything
else you want to tell me?

692
00:52:50,359 --> 00:52:53,593
Like what? I don't know. Blow my mind.

693
00:52:55,697 --> 00:52:58,999
Next month, my great
grandmother will be 102.

694
00:53:03,205 --> 00:53:04,938
Wow.

695
00:53:05,841 --> 00:53:08,842
(thunder rumbles)

696
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:21,320
Guess what. His name
really is Duane Reade.

697
00:53:21,356 --> 00:53:24,824
There's a warrant out on him
right now, and he's got a record:

698
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:27,527
breaking and entering,
burglary, agg assault,

699
00:53:27,562 --> 00:53:29,695
and always with a... guess.

700
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:31,664
- Chandra: <i>A knife?</i>
- A knife.

701
00:53:31,699 --> 00:53:33,699
- Chandra: <i>Where are you?</i>
- Why?

702
00:53:33,734 --> 00:53:36,914
Chandra: <i>So I know you're not out there
somewhere thinking about confronting him.</i>

703
00:53:36,938 --> 00:53:41,374
Are you kidding me? I'm
not crazy. I got to go.

704
00:53:48,783 --> 00:53:51,149
Hey, Que pasa? What's happening?

705
00:53:51,185 --> 00:53:54,119
- Hello. (speaks Spanish)
- Where's my money?

706
00:53:54,154 --> 00:53:55,621
(speaking Spanish)

707
00:53:55,656 --> 00:53:57,890
Duane said that he would
leave me the money.

708
00:53:57,925 --> 00:54:00,292
He didn't? I'm his lawyer. Look. See?

709
00:54:00,327 --> 00:54:01,426
- Duane?
- Duane.

710
00:54:01,462 --> 00:54:03,728
- Abogado?
- Yeah. Abogado. That's me.

711
00:54:03,763 --> 00:54:07,632
- (speaking Spanish)
- Uh...

712
00:54:07,667 --> 00:54:09,367
- (speaking Spanish)
- Duane Reade.

713
00:54:09,403 --> 00:54:11,736
- (speaking Spanish)
- No, not the pharmacy, the guy.

714
00:54:11,771 --> 00:54:14,639
- Where is he?
- (speaking Spanish)

715
00:54:14,674 --> 00:54:19,376
Yeah. Eh, that's my
problem. Don't worry about it.

716
00:54:19,412 --> 00:54:21,278
- Duane.
- Where is he?

717
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:25,850
He's in the back.

718
00:54:25,885 --> 00:54:27,085
- (speaking Spanish)
- Okay.

719
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,653
- (speaking Spanish)
- Keep the card.

720
00:54:28,688 --> 00:54:31,489
- (speaking Spanish)
- You never know.

721
00:54:31,524 --> 00:54:34,091
You never know. There you go.

Hey, guys.

725
00:55:03,188 --> 00:55:05,421
How's it going?

726
00:55:05,457 --> 00:55:07,823
Hey, Duane.

727
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:15,465
I was wondering if I could
talk to you about your boy Trevor.

728
00:55:17,101 --> 00:55:18,334
Who are you?

729
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:20,736
I'm his lawyer.

730
00:55:33,851 --> 00:55:36,085
Thanks.

731
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,655
So, uh, apparently, according to Trevor,

732
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:42,824
you were with him on 87th
Street the night of...

733
00:55:42,859 --> 00:55:45,661

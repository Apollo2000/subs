Would you agree?

8
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,493
So where's all the news trucks?

9
00:01:48,595 --> 00:01:51,963
Your basic uptown misdemeanor homicide.

10

(camera flashes)

11
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:25,797
What kind of knife was
used in this attack?

12
00:02:25,899 --> 00:02:28,366
One with a single-edged
non-serrated blade,

13
00:02:28,468 --> 00:02:30,602
approximately five inches in length.

14
00:02:30,704 --> 00:02:34,205
Something like... this one?

15
00:02:34,307 --> 00:02:35,874
Yes.

16
00:02:35,976 --> 00:02:40,445
And what about this wound

17
00:02:40,547 --> 00:02:43,748
on the defendant's hand?

18
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,084
That cut is the
result of his hand slipping

19
00:02:46,186 --> 00:02:48,820
from the handle of the
knife onto the blade of the knife

20
00:02:48,922 --> 00:02:50,655
in the act of stabbing her.

21
00:03:12,646 --> 00:03:14,012
Your witness.

22
00:03:16,783 --> 00:03:18,249
Dr. Chester,

23
00:03:18,351 --> 00:03:21,719
did you hear Mrs. Weiss ask
you the total number of wounds?

24
00:03:21,822 --> 00:03:22,754
No.

25
00:03:22,856 --> 00:03:25,023
Me neither. I wonder why that is?

26
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,392
Perhaps because we can see them.

27
00:03:27,494 --> 00:03:30,028
We can, that's true, and
they're hard to look at,

28
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,563
but how many of them are there?

29
00:03:31,665 --> 00:03:33,698
- Twenty-two.
- And what does that tell you?

30
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,034
It tells me she was stabbed 22 times.

31
00:03:36,136 --> 00:03:38,703
That's all? Such a
great number of wounds?

32
00:03:38,805 --> 00:03:41,706
Well, some people would say it
indicates a crime of passion.

33
00:03:41,808 --> 00:03:43,475
Chandra: That it was personal?

34
00:03:43,577 --> 00:03:46,744
That the killer had
something against the victim?

35
00:03:46,847 --> 00:03:47,979
Chester: Some would say.

36
00:03:48,081 --> 00:03:50,715
But not me, because I've
seen it both ways.

37
00:03:54,488 --> 00:03:57,422
This cut is very
important to the State's case.

38
00:03:57,524 --> 00:04:00,758
Any chance you could be mistaken
about what caused it?

39
00:04:00,861 --> 00:04:02,527
No.

40
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:06,865
Have you ever made a mistake that
sent an innocent man to prison?

41
00:04:06,967 --> 00:04:08,366
No.

42
00:04:08,468 --> 00:04:12,270
Arthur Metz didn't go to prison
because of your testimony at his trial?

43
00:04:12,372 --> 00:04:14,405
You don't remember him?

44
00:04:14,508 --> 00:04:15,473
No, I do.

45
00:04:15,575 --> 00:04:17,642
So you remember that Mr.
Metz was later exonerated

46
00:04:17,744 --> 00:04:20,378
based on a
reexamination of your findings?

47
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,947
My findings were
disputed, not disproven.

48
00:04:23,049 --> 00:04:24,883
I didn't say disputed or disproven,

49
00:04:24,985 --> 00:04:26,384
but whatever we want to call it,

50
00:04:26,486 --> 00:04:28,686
Mr. Metz is now a free man.

51
00:04:28,788 --> 00:04:30,955
Unless he's back in
prison for some other crime.

52
00:04:31,057 --> 00:04:33,625
He's not back in prison
for some other crime.

53
00:04:33,727 --> 00:04:35,793
And wasn't in prison
for some other crime

54
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:38,129
before your testimony put him there.

55
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:39,531
It wasn't a mistake.

56
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:41,299
The appellate court disagreed.

57
00:04:41,401 --> 00:04:43,201
It had a different
interpretation, that's all.

58
00:04:43,236 --> 00:04:44,869
That's all we're talking about here,

59
00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:47,005
a different interpretation,

60
00:04:47,107 --> 00:04:49,207
to avoid you having to come back,

61
00:04:49,309 --> 00:04:51,142
like you had to with Mr. Metz.

62
00:05:25,045 --> 00:05:27,145
(door opens)

63
00:05:30,884 --> 00:05:33,318
Everything that goes
on in there is important.

wears, what his eyes say,

66
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,000
I know it's not easy to
look at those pictures,

67
00:05:42,062 --> 00:05:44,529
but the jury has to, and so do you.

68
00:05:44,631 --> 00:05:47,098
You can't get up and leave like that.

69
00:05:49,202 --> 00:05:51,569
An animal did that.

70
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:54,672
Yeah. You're right.

71
00:05:55,942 --> 00:05:58,376
Did I raise an animal?

72
00:06:00,146 --> 00:06:01,379
What?

73
00:06:16,496 --> 00:06:17,962

00:06:19,332 --> 00:06:20,999
He wants to talk to you.

unavailable, it's probably him.

He said we won't get the
cab back no matter what.

82
00:07:28,001 --> 00:07:29,767
We're buying a new one.

83
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:32,270
An old new one.

84
00:07:33,373 --> 00:07:35,006
That's great.

85
00:07:36,609 --> 00:07:38,443
It's ours.

86
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:39,877

87
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:42,347
What are you talking
about? It's mine too.

88

No.

89
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,485
The car we can't get
back is yours, not this one.

00:07:47,587 --> 00:07:48,753
This one is mine too.

You cannot operate any car without me.

You don't have the money for anything.

We have the money. We can get the money.

97

It will solve your problems.

It's worth $250,000.

Because that's all we are going to pay.

And it will take us years

00:12:45,885 --> 00:12:48,552
He was young,
good-looking, I have money.

168
00:12:48,655 --> 00:12:51,389
Guess you could call that
some kind of prostitution,

169
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:53,224
but worked for us.

170
00:12:53,326 --> 00:12:55,526
Until the night I had to call 911

171
00:12:55,628 --> 00:12:57,361
with his hands around my throat.

172
00:12:57,463 --> 00:12:59,230
Really?

173
00:12:59,332 --> 00:13:01,666
Cops were quick, thank God.

174
00:13:01,768 --> 00:13:03,234
Did you press charges?

175
00:13:03,336 --> 00:13:05,469
Oh, yeah. They hauled him off.

176
00:13:05,571 --> 00:13:08,305
Next time I saw him was across
the conference table

177
00:13:08,408 --> 00:13:09,674
with the divorce lawyers,

178
00:13:09,776 --> 00:13:11,275
both of whom I was paying for

179
00:13:11,377 --> 00:13:13,878
since he didn't have a dime to his name.

180
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,980
Mine said, "Jeannie,

181
00:13:16,082 --> 00:13:17,882
"do you want to save some money?

182
00:13:17,984 --> 00:13:20,084
Give him 200 grand and walk away."

183
00:13:20,186 --> 00:13:23,788
Best legal advice I ever got.

184
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:27,391
You know why divorce is so expensive?

185
00:13:27,493 --> 00:13:29,894
- Because it's worth it.
- Because it's worth it.

186
00:13:29,996 --> 00:13:31,595
(chuckling)

187
00:13:31,698 --> 00:13:32,830
Right.

188
00:13:32,932 --> 00:13:34,598
You know what he does?

189
00:13:34,701 --> 00:13:36,300
A personal trainer, apparently.

190
00:13:36,402 --> 00:13:38,903
I mean his real line of work.

191
00:13:39,005 --> 00:13:41,272
He's a trapeze artist.

192
00:13:41,374 --> 00:13:43,874
Swings from one old bag to another.

193
00:13:43,976 --> 00:13:46,343
Don't sell yourself short.

194
00:13:48,314 --> 00:13:49,714
I'm not.

195
00:13:49,816 --> 00:13:51,582
It was a joke.

196
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:01,459
How you doing?

197
00:14:01,561 --> 00:14:03,227
I'm fine.

198
00:14:06,232 --> 00:14:08,099
Don't say it.

199
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,418
How often did you buy amphetamines
from the defendant?

200
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,487
They were just Adderall.

201
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:32,289
Which we know now from earlier testimony

202
00:14:32,391 --> 00:14:34,959
is stronger than your
average amphetamine.

203
00:14:35,061 --> 00:14:37,795
How often did you buy it from him?

204
00:14:37,897 --> 00:14:41,398
Just mainly at finals.

205
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:42,900
Mainly.

206
00:14:43,002 --> 00:14:44,635
So, at other times, too?

207
00:14:44,737 --> 00:14:49,673
No, just then and, you
know, maybe midterms,

208
00:14:49,776 --> 00:14:52,443
project deadlines,

209
00:14:52,545 --> 00:14:55,079
maybe once in a while for a party.

210
00:14:55,181 --> 00:14:56,914
So, a lot.

211
00:14:59,619 --> 00:15:01,719
You were his only customer?

212
00:15:09,729 --> 00:15:13,264
No. There were, you
know, some other friends.

213
00:15:13,366 --> 00:15:15,332
What did he charge?

214
00:15:15,434 --> 00:15:18,235
Ten dollars for a 10 milligram.

215
00:15:18,337 --> 00:15:20,237
You know where he got them?

216
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:22,540
I think he had a prescription.

217
00:15:22,642 --> 00:15:25,142
You know what he paid to have it filled?

218
00:15:27,346 --> 00:15:28,612
No.

219
00:15:33,486 --> 00:15:35,085
Ten-dollar co-pay,

220
00:15:35,188 --> 00:15:37,087
insurance paid the rest.

221
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:40,090
So, at his cost of 25 cents each,

222
00:15:40,193 --> 00:15:42,893
the $10 he was charging you

223
00:15:42,995 --> 00:15:48,332
comes to a 3,900% profit for him.

224
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:55,172
What's your major in college, Amir?

225
00:15:56,943 --> 00:15:58,809
Business.

226
00:15:58,911 --> 00:16:01,345
Do you know what Mr. Khan's is?

227
00:16:02,615 --> 00:16:04,315
Business.

228
00:16:05,418 --> 00:16:08,786
Which of you, would you
say, is learning the most?

229
00:16:18,364 --> 00:16:19,630
I'm done.

230
00:16:26,572 --> 00:16:31,041
(soft ballad playing)

231
00:16:45,024 --> 00:16:47,291
I'm going to bed.

232
00:16:47,393 --> 00:16:49,026
Night night.

233
00:16:50,429 --> 00:16:52,663
(steam hissing)

234
00:16:52,765 --> 00:16:56,166
(soft wheezing)

235
00:17:06,846 --> 00:17:08,545
(soft wheezing)

236
00:17:11,484 --> 00:17:13,250
Fucking cat.

237
00:17:24,497 --> 00:17:27,331
Hey, Gooden!

238
00:17:27,433 --> 00:17:30,434
Hey, come here. Gooden!

239
00:17:31,604 --> 00:17:33,504
I have no idea who that is.

240
00:17:33,606 --> 00:17:36,740
Hey! Gooden, come over here!

241
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,343
Come here!

242
00:17:39,445 --> 00:17:40,477
Hold on.

243
00:17:43,249 --> 00:17:45,049
I wanted to show you something.

244
00:17:46,285 --> 00:17:49,920
Check it out. No more sandals.

245
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,856
How 'bout that?

246
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:54,291
That's cool.

247
00:17:54,393 --> 00:17:55,826
I gotta go.

248
00:17:55,928 --> 00:17:57,594
Wait, Gooden.

249
00:17:57,697 --> 00:18:00,397
I wanna come over
later and give you something.

250
00:18:00,499 --> 00:18:01,565
What?

251
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:03,100
A cat.

252
00:18:03,202 --> 00:18:05,302
Dad, I don't want a cat. I want a pit.

253
00:18:05,404 --> 00:18:07,371
You don't want a pit.

254
00:18:07,473 --> 00:18:10,474
Look, I gotta go, all right?

255
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,177
Tell your mom about the cat.

256
00:18:22,355 --> 00:18:23,954
Huh.

257
00:18:32,031 --> 00:18:35,366
(loud chattering)

258
00:18:47,413 --> 00:18:48,879
Woman: Gate!

259
00:18:48,981 --> 00:18:50,981
(alarm buzzes)

260
00:18:52,418 --> 00:18:53,917
Come on.

261
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,052
Let's go.

262
00:19:14,707 --> 00:19:16,340
Woman: How is he?

263
00:19:16,442 --> 00:19:18,409
He's fine.

264
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:22,212
I'm so worried about him.

265
00:19:23,282 --> 00:19:24,748
He's fine.

266
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,921
(police radio chattering)

267
00:20:04,317 --> 00:20:07,035
Coach: <i>He didn't even look down
the stairs to see how Diaz landed.</i>

268
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:10,060
He just walked off like
he was going to class.

269
00:20:10,162 --> 00:20:11,662
- Did you talk to him?
- Oh, yeah.

270
00:20:11,764 --> 00:20:14,176
I grabbed him straight away, said,
"What the hell you do that for?"

271
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,365
What did he say?

272
00:20:15,468 --> 00:20:17,301
Nothing.

273
00:20:17,403 --> 00:20:19,103
He just looked at me.

274
00:20:20,106 --> 00:20:22,372
Looked at you how?

275
00:20:22,475 --> 00:20:24,541
Like nonreactive.

276
00:20:24,643 --> 00:20:27,311
Like he had no idea what he'd done?

277
00:20:29,115 --> 00:20:30,914
In that neighborhood.

278
00:20:32,418 --> 00:20:33,917
Your witness.

279
00:20:36,489 --> 00:20:39,590
This incident took
place not long after 9/11.

280
00:20:39,692 --> 00:20:43,427
How would you describe the mood
of the student body at that time?

281
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:47,097
Uh, for want of a better
word, I'd say patriotic.

282
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:50,134
Okay. And in this patriotic atmosphere,

283
00:20:50,236 --> 00:20:52,836
how would you say the
Muslim students fared?

284
00:20:52,938 --> 00:20:55,072
It was tough on them, I'll be honest.

285
00:20:55,174 --> 00:20:57,741
Racist comments,
taunts, that kind of thing.

286
00:20:57,843 --> 00:21:00,110
Yeah, but Khan was the
only one at school

287
00:21:00,212 --> 00:21:03,180
who sent two students to
the hospital because of it.

288
00:21:10,723 --> 00:21:12,422
Two...

289
00:21:12,525 --> 00:21:15,559
His first week back after the
suspension for the stairs thing,

290
00:21:15,661 --> 00:21:19,329
he threw a full Coke can
at a kid in the cafeteria.

291
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:22,266
Twelve stitches.

292
00:21:24,637 --> 00:21:26,203
In his face.

293
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,116
Thank you.

294
00:21:42,154 --> 00:21:43,387
Judge: Mrs. Weiss.

295
00:21:44,657 --> 00:21:47,191
The State rests, Your Honor.

296
00:21:49,762 --> 00:21:54,565
(somber Mideastern music playing)

297
00:22:27,499 --> 00:22:29,233
(grunts)

298
00:22:32,571 --> 00:22:36,940
There you go. That's good. Come on.

299
00:22:37,042 --> 00:22:39,209
You okay?

300
00:22:39,311 --> 00:22:40,644
Yeah.

301
00:22:40,746 --> 00:22:42,613
You sure?

302
00:22:44,617 --> 00:22:45,782
No, no, no.

303
00:22:45,884 --> 00:22:48,252
No, just take it. Just take it.

304
00:22:48,354 --> 00:22:49,920
Where you going?

305
00:22:50,022 --> 00:22:51,355
Hey!

306
00:22:51,457 --> 00:22:53,357
Hey. Hey! What...

307
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:55,058
What the...

308
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,393
Aah!

309
00:22:56,495 --> 00:22:59,029
You think you're invisible?

310
00:22:59,131 --> 00:23:00,330
The invisible man?

311
00:23:00,432 --> 00:23:01,398
(gagging)

312
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,769
You talk to my
coworkers, my friends, my ex,

313
00:23:05,871 --> 00:23:08,505
and you don't think I'll
find out about it?

314
00:23:08,607 --> 00:23:10,907
Seriously, get this off of me.

315
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:14,044
Maybe I should have a little
talk with your ex-wife?

316
00:23:14,146 --> 00:23:15,879
Or your son?

317
00:23:15,981 --> 00:23:20,284
At that artsy-fartsy school of his.

318
00:23:23,522 --> 00:23:25,122
Oh, shit.

319
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:35,999
Fuck.

320
00:23:36,101 --> 00:23:39,136
(grunting)

321
00:23:56,789 --> 00:24:00,023
(phone ringing)

322
00:24:13,205 --> 00:24:14,871
(line beeps)

323
00:24:22,247 --> 00:24:23,814
Man (on TV): <i>They are strong swimmers,</i>

324
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:27,284
<i>able to cross rivers five miles wide.</i>

325
00:24:27,386 --> 00:24:30,854
<i>The river offers this
tiger a place to bathe,</i>

326
00:24:30,956 --> 00:24:32,989
<i>hunt, or rather, fish...</i>

327
00:24:33,092 --> 00:24:34,891
You talk to her?

328
00:24:34,993 --> 00:24:36,259
No.

329
00:24:36,362 --> 00:24:40,063
Man: <i>Unlike most cats, tigers
are comfortable in water.</i>

330
00:24:40,165 --> 00:24:42,866
<i>This tiger clearly is.</i>

331
00:24:42,968 --> 00:24:45,369
<i>The river is...</i>

332
00:24:45,471 --> 00:24:47,971
<i>Box: You see that, right?</i>

333
00:24:50,442 --> 00:24:53,744
<i>That's recording us, and

Detective, what made
you so sure so quickly

337
00:25:06,058 --> 00:25:07,691
Nasir Khan was your man?

338
00:25:07,793 --> 00:25:09,659
The mountain of evidence.

339
00:25:09,762 --> 00:25:11,528
So why bother questioning him?

340
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:15,866
Sometimes a suspect wants nothing
more than to confess.

341
00:25:15,968 --> 00:25:17,801
- Did he?
- No.

342
00:25:17,903 --> 00:25:20,604
So, that's when you charged him,
when you left the interview room?

343
00:25:20,706 --> 00:25:21,872
No.

344
00:25:21,974 --> 00:25:23,173
Why not?

345
00:25:23,275 --> 00:25:25,909
Sometimes the suspect needs
time to think things through.

346
00:25:26,011 --> 00:25:29,746
So, you gave him some time, and
he's sitting in the squad room pen,

347
00:25:29,848 --> 00:25:31,348
awaiting transfer downtown.

348
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:32,682
That's when he confessed?

349
00:25:32,785 --> 00:25:34,384
If he had, we wouldn't be here.

350
00:25:34,486 --> 00:25:38,955
So, after the arrest, you gave him the
opportunity to confess and he didn't.

351
00:25:39,057 --> 00:25:42,492
Then 12 hours later, after you gave
him the opportunity to think about it,

352
00:25:42,594 --> 00:25:44,261
he didn't confess.

353
00:25:44,363 --> 00:25:47,697
Then when the DA gave him the
opportunity to accept just 15 years

354
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,466
instead of a possible life sentence,

355
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,668
he didn't confess.

356
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,671
I don't know, 15 years sounds
like a pretty good deal to me,

357
00:25:54,773 --> 00:25:57,474
what with a mountain of
evidence, don't you?

358
00:25:57,576 --> 00:26:00,444
I'll take evidence over a confession

359
00:26:00,546 --> 00:26:02,612
any day of the week.

360

didn't note these skin cells,

499
00:36:10,889 --> 00:36:12,655
but they're in the table.

500
00:36:12,757 --> 00:36:15,858
So, if this is how this
wound occurred during this game,

501
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,027
that could explain
how the victim's blood

502
00:36:18,129 --> 00:36:19,529
came to be on this knife?

503
00:36:19,631 --> 00:36:20,830
Yes.

504
00:36:25,336 --> 00:36:26,836
This is the basement level.

505
00:36:26,938 --> 00:36:28,204
Correct.

506
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:33,042
- What's this?
- The front gate.

507
00:36:33,144 --> 00:36:34,410
I notice it's ajar.

508
00:36:34,512 --> 00:36:37,914
It's ajar because it doesn't
close. It hasn't for years.

509
00:36:40,652 --> 00:36:42,718
The rust on the latch shows that.

510
00:36:45,657 --> 00:36:46,656
And this?

511
00:36:46,758 --> 00:36:48,624
The front basement
door, which does close,

512
00:36:48,726 --> 00:36:51,394
but the crime scene detectives
noted that it was unlocked,

513
00:36:51,496 --> 00:36:55,531
as was a second-story
window on the garden side.

514
00:36:57,435 --> 00:36:58,935
Would it be possible for someone...

515
00:36:59,037 --> 00:37:00,815
Say, an intruder... To
get to that window, though,

516
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:02,116
being a level up from the garden?

517
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,006
Yes, there's a tree right there.

518
00:37:04,075 --> 00:37:05,108
This tree?

519
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:06,075
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

520
00:37:06,177 --> 00:37:07,537
But how do you know it's scalable?

521
00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:11,481
Because I scaled it,
easily, and I'm pushing 70.

522
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:13,349
You don't look it.

523
00:37:13,451 --> 00:37:15,251
I feel it sometimes.

524
00:37:15,353 --> 00:37:18,621
While you were scaling this
tree to the second-floor window,

525
00:37:18,723 --> 00:37:21,357
could you see the
basement-level kitchen?

526
00:37:21,459 --> 00:37:22,792
No.

527
00:37:22,894 --> 00:37:25,161
What if you came through
the gate that won't close

528
00:37:25,263 --> 00:37:27,797
and door that was unlocked
and went up the staircase?

529
00:37:27,899 --> 00:37:29,844
You could see someone in
the kitchen then, I imagine,

530
00:37:29,868 --> 00:37:31,078
since they're on the same level.

531
00:37:31,102 --> 00:37:33,269
No. I took a picture of this.

532
00:37:36,474 --> 00:37:40,810
That shows what you see of the
kitchen from the staircase.

533
00:37:43,581 --> 00:37:45,248
What kitchen?

534
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,517
Exactly. What kitchen?

535
00:37:49,187 --> 00:37:50,686
Thank you, Dr. Katz.

536
00:37:51,956 --> 00:37:54,157
Judge: Your witness, Mrs. Weiss.

537
00:37:55,994 --> 00:37:57,093
(clears throat)

538
00:38:04,569 --> 00:38:05,801
Dr. Katz,

539
00:38:05,904 --> 00:38:07,703
it's a pleasure to meet you.

540
00:38:07,805 --> 00:38:08,971
And you.

541
00:38:09,073 --> 00:38:11,607
Me? Okay, thank you.

542
00:38:11,709 --> 00:38:13,876
But I'm not famous like you are.

543
00:38:13,978 --> 00:38:16,846
I'm not famous. No
pathologist is famous.

544
00:38:16,948 --> 00:38:19,615
Maybe I'm known in
certain professional circles,

545
00:38:19,717 --> 00:38:20,983
but that's about it.

546
00:38:21,085 --> 00:38:23,519
No one recognizes you on the street?

547
00:38:23,621 --> 00:38:28,558
If they do, maybe they saw my picture
on the back of one of my books.

548
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,626
Or on TV?

549
00:38:30,728 --> 00:38:33,696
Since you've testified in
a lot of high-profile,

550
00:38:33,798 --> 00:38:35,998
sometimes televised trials.

551
00:38:37,902 --> 00:38:41,737
But in pathology, fame
plays no part, does it?

552
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,941
Whether you're a New
York City medical examiner

553
00:38:45,043 --> 00:38:46,309
like Dr. Chester,

554
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:48,744
who no one recognizes on the street,

555
00:38:48,846 --> 00:38:52,315
or an expert witness for O.J. Simpson.

556
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:53,649
Chandra: Objection.

557
00:38:53,751 --> 00:38:54,951
To what?

558
00:38:55,053 --> 00:38:57,019
It's a compliment.

559
00:38:57,121 --> 00:38:58,754
Judge: Overruled.

560
00:39:02,293 --> 00:39:06,329
Is Dr. Chester, unknown as
he may be to the public,

561
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:09,265
a good pathologist?

562
00:39:09,367 --> 00:39:13,402
Since I'm under oath, I'd
have to say, not in my opinion.

563
00:39:13,504 --> 00:39:14,904
You disagree with him?

564
00:39:15,006 --> 00:39:18,040
Not only about the victim's hand wound,

565
00:39:18,142 --> 00:39:20,509
but also...

566
00:39:20,612 --> 00:39:24,347
what he said about this knife wound

567
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:26,182
on the defendant's hand?

568
00:39:26,284 --> 00:39:29,085
I do. Because it's
not a knife wound caused

569
00:39:29,187 --> 00:39:31,721
by his hand slipping from
the handle onto the blade.

570
00:39:31,823 --> 00:39:36,759
It was cut on a piece of
glass from the broken door pane.

571
00:39:36,861 --> 00:39:38,928
So, he doesn't know what
he's talking about?

572
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:41,998
I'd like to find a nicer way to put it.

573
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,368
How about like this.

574
00:39:48,439 --> 00:39:51,140
"Dr. Chester is a modern day giant

575
00:39:51,242 --> 00:39:53,476
in the field of forensic pathology.

576
00:39:53,578 --> 00:39:57,313
We'd all be well-advised to
try to emulate his wisdom

577
00:39:57,415 --> 00:39:59,915
and scientific exactitude."

578
00:40:00,018 --> 00:40:01,817
You know who said that?

579
00:40:03,721 --> 00:40:05,221
Me.

580
00:40:05,323 --> 00:40:08,291
- Where?
- A testimonial dinner.

581
00:40:08,393 --> 00:40:11,294
Your praise sounds so sincere.

582
00:40:11,396 --> 00:40:12,962
Are you saying it wasn't?

583
00:40:13,064 --> 00:40:15,164
You're asked to speak about someone,

584
00:40:15,266 --> 00:40:18,367
do you embarrass them by
saying what you really think?

585
00:40:18,469 --> 00:40:20,202
You could decline to speak.

586
00:40:20,305 --> 00:40:23,939
But that would have
embarrassed him just as much.

587
00:40:25,176 --> 00:40:27,843
So, what were you really thinking

588
00:40:27,945 --> 00:40:29,578
up there in front of all those people

589
00:40:29,681 --> 00:40:31,914
saying things you didn't
believe to be true

590
00:40:32,016 --> 00:40:33,582
in such a convincing manner?

591
00:40:33,685 --> 00:40:36,519
Honestly? Dessert.

592
00:40:36,621 --> 00:40:39,288
(spectators laughing)

593
00:40:45,763 --> 00:40:49,765
The knife you described
as missing from its set,

594
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:51,233
do you know when it was bought?

595
00:40:51,336 --> 00:40:54,136
No, but I know it couldn't
have been later than 2008

596
00:40:54,238 --> 00:40:57,206
since that's when that
model was discontinued.

597
00:40:58,142 --> 00:41:00,676
I bought my husband an electric drill

598
00:41:00,778 --> 00:41:04,080
with an array of two
dozen drill bits in 2008.

599
00:41:04,182 --> 00:41:07,316
Admittedly, not the
most romantic birthday gift,

600
00:41:07,418 --> 00:41:08,918
but he's a happy putterer.

601
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,454
Well, so am I. I'd find it romantic.

602
00:41:12,357 --> 00:41:15,124
- My point is...
- I think we already know.

603
00:41:17,261 --> 00:41:18,761
Dr. Katz...

604
00:41:18,863 --> 00:41:21,797
we've both been doing what
we do for a long time,

605
00:41:21,899 --> 00:41:24,700
and it's put us in
courtrooms for too many days.

606
00:41:24,802 --> 00:41:27,336
But as a result, we
know the rules of the court,

607
00:41:27,438 --> 00:41:30,473
and one of them is you
answer the questions I ask,

608
00:41:30,575 --> 00:41:32,341
not ones I don't.

609
00:41:33,277 --> 00:41:36,245
Sure. Okay.

610
00:41:36,347 --> 00:41:40,216
After six years, how many
of those 24 drill bits

611
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:43,719
do you think are still in their case?

612
00:41:43,821 --> 00:41:45,254
None of them.

613
00:41:45,356 --> 00:41:46,522
None of them.

614
00:41:46,624 --> 00:41:48,224
My husband has lost them all.

615
00:41:48,326 --> 00:41:51,060
Then I know what you should
get him for Christmas.

616
00:41:51,162 --> 00:41:52,995
He doesn't deserve it.

617
00:41:53,097 --> 00:41:54,130
Okay.

618
00:41:54,232 --> 00:41:56,732
Now you can answer the
question I haven't asked

619
00:41:56,834 --> 00:41:59,201
'cause you know what it is.

620
00:41:59,303 --> 00:42:02,071
The missing fourth
knife, it could have been lost

621
00:42:02,173 --> 00:42:04,407
or chewed up in the garbage disposal,

622
00:42:04,509 --> 00:42:07,243
or thrown out at some point in time.

623
00:42:10,748 --> 00:42:12,548
And this.

624
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:15,584
This wound on the victim's hand,

625
00:42:15,686 --> 00:42:18,053
which occurred, you say,

626
00:42:18,156 --> 00:42:21,424
during a game none of
us would want to play.

627
00:42:21,526 --> 00:42:24,326
But if we did, if you did,

628
00:42:24,429 --> 00:42:28,130
do you really think, as the
blood is running down your arm

629
00:42:28,232 --> 00:42:30,099
and pooling on the table,

630
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:32,868
you'd feel like having sex?

631
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:34,737
Or would you rather

632
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:36,872
want to be rushed to the emergency room?

633
00:42:36,974 --> 00:42:39,041
Personally, the emergency room,

634
00:42:39,143 --> 00:42:42,278
but I understand there
were a lot of drugs involved.

635
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:47,249
Okay.

636
00:42:47,351 --> 00:42:48,517
Thank you, Dr. Katz.

637
00:42:48,619 --> 00:42:51,654
It really has been a
pleasure meeting you.

638
00:43:00,565 --> 00:43:01,831
I'm confused.

639
00:43:01,933 --> 00:43:04,233
Is this yours?

640
00:43:04,335 --> 00:43:05,367
Yeah.

641
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:08,537
Because it's gone
now. It's not in evidence.

642
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:09,939
Well, I don't have it anymore.

643
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:11,361
I know you don't have it anymore.

644
00:43:11,409 --> 00:43:13,843
You left it there, but
they should have it.

645
00:43:13,945 --> 00:43:16,445
Well, I had it. They
took it to the tombs.

646
00:43:16,547 --> 00:43:19,515
How could you have had
it then if it's here?

647
00:43:19,617 --> 00:43:21,951
Oh, because he gave
it back to me that night,

648
00:43:22,053 --> 00:43:24,353
<i>in the squad room.</i>

649
00:43:24,455 --> 00:43:26,422
Stone: <i>Who did?</i>

650
00:43:26,524 --> 00:43:28,691
Nasir: <i>The detective.</i>

651
00:43:37,068 --> 00:43:39,168
Box?

652
00:43:40,371 --> 00:43:43,305
♪ ♪

653
00:43:55,219 --> 00:43:56,919
Excited about the big night?

654
00:43:57,021 --> 00:43:58,387
Thrilled.

655
00:44:06,964 --> 00:44:08,230
Can I help you with that?

656
00:44:08,332 --> 00:44:09,999
You can move, that'd help.

657
00:44:26,918 --> 00:44:29,068
Do you swear or affirm
to tell the truth,

658
00:44:29,093 --> 00:44:31,344
the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth?

659
00:44:31,422 --> 00:44:32,655
Yes.

660
00:44:35,526 --> 00:44:36,892
Detective, welcome back.

661
00:44:40,097 --> 00:44:43,332
I heard you're about to retire.

662
00:44:43,434 --> 00:44:44,533
I heard that too.

663
00:44:44,635 --> 00:44:46,302
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

664
00:44:46,404 --> 00:44:47,503
How long has it been?

665
00:44:47,605 --> 00:44:48,871
Thirty-three years.

666
00:44:48,973 --> 00:44:51,293
Well, you'll be sorely missed
by your colleagues, I'm sure,

667
00:44:51,342 --> 00:44:53,409
and by us, the public, too.

668
00:44:53,511 --> 00:44:55,611
We thank you for your service.

669
00:45:01,719 --> 00:45:03,752
Can you tell us in the
course of your investigation

670
00:45:03,854 --> 00:45:05,487
how many suspects you interviewed?

671
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:08,223
One, the defendant.

672
00:45:08,326 --> 00:45:10,459
Not Trevor Williams?

673
00:45:11,729 --> 00:45:13,796
<i>Yeah.</i>

674
00:45:13,898 --> 00:45:15,731
<i>This towelhead.</i>

675
00:45:15,833 --> 00:45:20,769
He was a witness, so,
yes, of course, I spoke to him.

676
00:45:20,871 --> 00:45:23,606
As a result of that interview,
you didn't do any follow-ups?

677
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:25,107
Nothing to follow up.

678
00:45:25,209 --> 00:45:27,977
You didn't interview Duane Reade?

679
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,179
Someone at Duane Reade?

680
00:45:30,281 --> 00:45:32,348
An individual named Duane Reade.

681
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:34,617
Is that a joke?

682
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:36,552
No, but I'm sure he gets that a lot.

683
00:45:36,654 --> 00:45:39,722
He was with Mr. Williams when
he had words with the defendant

684
00:45:39,824 --> 00:45:42,024
and Ms. Cornish outsider
her home that night.

685
00:45:42,126 --> 00:45:43,592
But you didn't interview him?

686
00:45:43,694 --> 00:45:45,361
Mr. Williams said he was alone,

687
00:45:45,463 --> 00:45:47,896
so, no, I didn't interview
anyone he wasn't with.

688
00:45:47,999 --> 00:45:50,243
So you're unaware of Mr.
Reade's numerous

689
00:45:50,268 --> 00:45:52,191
convictions for aggravated assault?

690
00:45:55,272 --> 00:45:56,605
What about Royal Day?

691
00:45:56,707 --> 00:45:59,108
Who's he? A friend of Duane Reade's?

692
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:00,643
The other eyewitness.

693
00:46:00,745 --> 00:46:03,045
Mr. Caval, who lives across the street

694
00:46:03,147 --> 00:46:05,948
<i>who called in the break-in
was the other eyewitness.</i>

695
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:07,616
Chandra: <i>No, he's another eyewitness,</i>

696
00:46:07,718 --> 00:46:09,885
<i>but, like Mr. Reade, not
the only other one.</i>

697
00:46:09,987 --> 00:46:11,654
You didn't interview Mr. Day?

698
00:46:11,756 --> 00:46:15,591
Again, I don't interview
people I don't know about.

699
00:46:15,693 --> 00:46:17,192
You know about him. You've seen him.

700
00:46:17,294 --> 00:46:19,762
In the security
tapes at the Shell station.

701
00:46:25,069 --> 00:46:29,038
He too had an unpleasant encounter with
the victim and defendant that night.

702
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:31,173
Are you sure you didn't interview him?

703
00:46:31,275 --> 00:46:34,276
Asked and answered.

704
00:46:37,148 --> 00:46:39,081
In your 19 years in homicide,

705
00:46:39,183 --> 00:46:40,783
how many crime scenes have you worked?

706
00:46:40,885 --> 00:46:43,752
I don't know. Three
hundred, give or take.

707
00:46:43,854 --> 00:46:46,255
And at these 300, give
or take, crime scenes,

708
00:46:46,357 --> 00:46:48,824
at any crime scene, it's
important, isn't it,

709
00:46:48,926 --> 00:46:51,827
that evidence is
examined, photographed, cataloged,

710
00:46:51,929 --> 00:46:53,796
and carefully stored?

711
00:46:53,898 --> 00:46:55,564
Obviously.

712
00:47:03,607 --> 00:47:05,074
What's that?

713
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:10,846
An asthma inhaler.

714
00:47:10,948 --> 00:47:13,482
Any idea where it is?

715
00:47:13,584 --> 00:47:15,818
- You'd have to ask him.
- Who?

716
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,853
The defendant. I gave it to him.

717
00:47:17,955 --> 00:47:19,855
What he did with it, I wouldn't know.

718
00:47:19,957 --> 00:47:22,091
I'm sorry, you gave it...

719
00:47:22,193 --> 00:47:24,259
Yeah. Should I say it again?

720
00:47:26,397 --> 00:47:28,330
I'm trying to understand this.

721
00:47:28,432 --> 00:47:30,272
You're saying you took
it from the crime scene,

722
00:47:30,367 --> 00:47:32,301
- and gave it to him?
- That's right.

723
00:47:32,403 --> 00:47:33,736
Why?

724
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:35,671
Because he needed it.

725
00:47:35,773 --> 00:47:38,307
He was distressed. He was
having trouble breathing.

726
00:47:38,409 --> 00:47:40,309
So, instead of taking
him to the hospital,

727
00:47:40,411 --> 00:47:42,923
which is how it's supposed to work
when something like that happens,

728
00:47:42,947 --> 00:47:45,748
you removed evidence
from the crime scene?

729
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:47,116
Yes, I did.

730
00:47:47,218 --> 00:47:49,318
Because it had been photographed
and logged,

731
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,019
so there was no reason not to.

732
00:47:51,122 --> 00:47:54,423
Other than it runs counter to
standard police rules and practices

733
00:47:54,525 --> 00:47:57,726
regarding chain of evidence and
is grossly unprofessional?

734
00:47:57,828 --> 00:48:01,497
Which, with 33 years
experience, you would certainly know.

735
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:02,998
He was suffering.

736
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,667
My apologies for trying
to lessen his suffering.

737
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:07,903
That's why you did it?

738
00:48:08,005 --> 00:48:10,372
Not because it didn't fit?

739
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:14,543
I really don't know what that means.

740
00:48:14,645 --> 00:48:19,314
"If the glove don't
fit, you must acquit."

741
00:48:20,284 --> 00:48:22,351
An inhaler doesn't fit how we picture

742
00:48:22,453 --> 00:48:24,620
a crazed killer trying
to stab someone 22 times

743
00:48:24,722 --> 00:48:27,089
between hits off his Ventolin.

744
00:48:27,191 --> 00:48:29,124
No. That's not why.

745
00:48:29,226 --> 00:48:30,793
I told you why.

746
00:48:30,895 --> 00:48:33,095
I'm not saying you consciously
thought about it.

747
00:48:33,197 --> 00:48:35,130
I'm wondering if
maybe it was subconscious,

748
00:48:35,232 --> 00:48:38,600
if you were having doubts about
his guilt from the beginning.

749
00:48:38,702 --> 00:48:40,135
Subconscious?

750
00:48:40,237 --> 00:48:41,904
Mm-hmm.

751
00:48:42,006 --> 00:48:46,008
Well, if one could describe what
goes on in their sub-conscious mind,

752
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:48,110
it wouldn't be sub-conscious, would it?

753
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,714
So, I guess there's no
way for us to know.

754

2
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,426
Homosexual?

3
00:02:12,462 --> 00:02:13,762
No.

4
00:02:13,797 --> 00:02:15,330
On any meds?

5
00:02:15,365 --> 00:02:17,399
Ventolin for my asthma.

6
00:02:18,802 --> 00:02:20,669
- Anything else?
- No.

7
00:02:20,704 --> 00:02:24,906
You sure? You're looking
a little walleyed there.

8
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:28,076
Um... I'm nervous.

9
00:02:30,147 --> 00:02:33,014
Suicidal ideations?

10
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,982
Ideations?

11
00:02:35,018 --> 00:02:38,252
Are you thinking about killing yourself?

12
00:02:38,287 --> 00:02:40,021
No.

13
00:02:40,056 --> 00:02:43,424
You in fear for your life?

14
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:45,292
Should I be?

15
00:02:45,327 --> 00:02:48,095
You a civilian?

16
00:02:49,331 --> 00:02:51,398
No gang affiliation?

17
00:02:53,102 --> 00:02:54,834
Okay.

18
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,239
Well, in that case, good luck to you.

19
00:03:03,612 --> 00:03:07,448
Let me ask you something. Where
were you before you came up here?

20
00:03:07,483 --> 00:03:10,384
- Coffee room.
- How did you get here?

21
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:12,052
What... what do you mean?

22
00:03:12,087 --> 00:03:15,989
Did you consume caffeinated,
dark beverages at 1100 hours

23
00:03:16,024 --> 00:03:18,992
before commencing to proceed,
in an orderly fashion,

24
00:03:19,027 --> 00:03:22,762
to the present location,
or did you walk here?

25
00:03:22,798 --> 00:03:25,131
We walked here.

26
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:29,302
Do them again, in English.

27
00:03:29,337 --> 00:03:32,738
Actually, I was wondering about the
part where she mentions me throwing up.

28
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,359
You did.

29
00:03:33,384 --> 00:03:37,601
I know, but is it okay if
she leaves that part out?

30
00:03:39,114 --> 00:03:42,014
See them?

31
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:44,516
Either one of them goes
in front of a jury,

32
00:03:44,551 --> 00:03:46,418
he's done for.

33
00:03:46,453 --> 00:03:48,887
You know why? The eyes.

34
00:03:48,923 --> 00:03:50,889
There's no one home.

35
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:53,892
They'll look at you like they'd just
as soon gut you as ask you the time.

36
00:03:53,928 --> 00:03:57,930
It doesn't make a difference if the prosecutor
speaks gibberish, they're going away.

37
00:03:57,965 --> 00:04:01,099
But Nasir Khan, he
doesn't look like them.

38
00:04:01,135 --> 00:04:03,335
He looks like any other
normal college kid,

39
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,473
so the jury's gonna wonder, "Could he
really stick that knife into that girl?"

40
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:10,775
We have to fight that.

41
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,279
I'm... I'm sorry. I don't...
I don't understand.

42
00:04:14,314 --> 00:04:17,515
- What's your first name?
- Robert.

43
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:21,719
Office Robert Maldonado,
fresh out of the academy.

44
00:04:21,755 --> 00:04:25,056
He goes into a crime scene and
he comes out throwing up.

45
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:26,758
And why shouldn't he? He's a new cop,

46
00:04:26,793 --> 00:04:29,226
just saw his first dead body.

47
00:04:29,262 --> 00:04:32,396
Now, Nasir Khan may very
well be a human being,

48
00:04:32,431 --> 00:04:34,331
but so was Andrea Cornish,

49
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:37,568
and so is Robert "Bobby" Maldonado.

50
00:04:37,603 --> 00:04:42,540
So you throwing up...
absolutely, keep it in.

51
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,842
Now, get out of here.

52
00:05:00,525 --> 00:05:05,862
So who's the lead on the
Khan kid case? Helen?

53
00:05:05,898 --> 00:05:07,863
This concerns you, John, because...?

54
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:10,933
Because I'm representing him.

55
00:05:10,968 --> 00:05:14,237
I'm sorry, but how on earth?

56
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,871
You had a chance to review or no?

57
00:05:15,907 --> 00:05:18,308
You were at the precinct
when they brought him in.

58
00:05:18,343 --> 00:05:19,875
That's how it happened, isn't it?

59
00:05:19,911 --> 00:05:23,445
He's a sweet kid, actually,
soft-spoken, sincere.

60
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,914
Cool.

61
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,049
I'd like to give his
loving parents some idea

62
00:05:27,085 --> 00:05:29,384
of what it's gonna cost, and
to do that, it'd be helpful

63
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,089
to know how strong a
case you think it is.

64
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:36,625
- Strong.
- Strong? Or strong?

65
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,909
Wait till you see the
crime-scene photos.

66
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:39,104
Ah, come on.

67
00:05:39,493 --> 00:05:41,659
- What do you got?
- Everything.

68
00:05:41,898 --> 00:05:46,167
I don't know why Helen's not on to the
next murder. This one's done. Sorry.

69
00:05:46,203 --> 00:05:49,671
Hey, you're not gonna get rich off
of this one. It's gonna be quick.

70
00:05:49,707 --> 00:05:54,243
- How's the feet?
- Okay.

71
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:59,080
Ah, fuck.

72
00:06:07,758 --> 00:06:10,291
Three. 105.

73
00:06:12,328 --> 00:06:14,962
Yeah, here it is.

74
00:06:14,997 --> 00:06:16,764
Okay.

75
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:22,069
Here goes nothing.

76
00:06:22,104 --> 00:06:25,906
With the proofs the District
Attorney's office think they have,

77
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:31,344
there's a good chance your son
is facing life imprisonment.

78
00:06:33,382 --> 00:06:36,483
The good news is that's
why we go to court.

79
00:06:36,518 --> 00:06:39,419
But any way you slice it,
it's gonna be a long battle

80
00:06:39,454 --> 00:06:42,455
with no guarantee of a
successful outcome.

81
00:06:42,491 --> 00:06:47,594
And any lawyer who comes to you with
the words "I guarantee!" is a liar.

82
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:49,396
But I promise you this.

83
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:52,632
I'll work every angle I can for Naz,

84
00:06:52,668 --> 00:06:57,837
and I won't rest until everything
that can be done is done.

85
00:06:57,872 --> 00:07:00,740
- Thank you.
- However,

86
00:07:00,776 --> 00:07:04,010
a good defense costs money.

87
00:07:04,045 --> 00:07:08,247
How much? Let me tell you
this before I tell you that.

88
00:07:08,283 --> 00:07:12,018
Most lawyers charge by the hour. Why?

89
00:07:12,053 --> 00:07:14,187
Because it's to their benefit.

90
00:07:14,222 --> 00:07:17,890
Every phone call, email,
meeting, motion, delay,

91
00:07:17,926 --> 00:07:21,694
every note jotted down on every
Post-it, the meter's running.

92
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:25,063
With a murder, that could
easily run $150,000.

93
00:07:25,098 --> 00:07:27,499
Now, I'm not gonna do that to you.

94
00:07:27,535 --> 00:07:29,501
I'm charging a flat fee.

95
00:07:29,537 --> 00:07:33,639
$75,000 if it goes to trial, and
half of that if it doesn't.

96
00:07:33,674 --> 00:07:36,174
If it doesn't what?

97
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,944
- Go to trial.
- You mean if they drop the charges.

98
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:42,247
Oh, no, no, no, no. They're not gonna
do that. I mean if there's a plea.

99
00:07:42,282 --> 00:07:44,015
A plea to what?

100
00:07:44,051 --> 00:07:46,918
To something less than
first-degree murder,

101
00:07:46,954 --> 00:07:48,987
like second-degree murder.

102
00:07:49,022 --> 00:07:51,756
He didn't murder anyone. Why
would you even say that?

103
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:55,125
There probably won't be a plea.
The state seems confident.

104
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:58,496
I just mention it in terms of my fee.

105
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:05,069
$75,000.

106
00:08:05,104 --> 00:08:07,405
I know it sounds like a lot of money,

107
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,442
but I guarantee you that no competent
lawyer would take it on for any less.

108
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:15,279
How do you expect me to pay you?

109
00:08:15,314 --> 00:08:17,314
We have $8,000 in the bank.

110
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:21,018
Can you get any friends
or relatives to help out?

111
00:08:21,053 --> 00:08:24,255
Everyone we know is in
worse shape than us.

112
00:08:25,424 --> 00:08:27,023
You own your own house.

113
00:08:35,734 --> 00:08:38,402
Look, I'll do it for 60,

114
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:41,204
and that's only because I
couldn't live with myself

115
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:45,608
if your son went down because of some
cut-rate, take-the-money-and-run hustler.

116
00:08:46,844 --> 00:08:50,280
I'm sorry. We can't afford you.

117
00:08:50,315 --> 00:08:52,415
Okay.

118
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:57,953
Then here's your best option:

119
00:08:57,988 --> 00:09:01,256
a legal-aid lawyer.

120
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:03,626
And here's what you get for your money.

121
00:09:03,661 --> 00:09:05,694
It's a guy who starts his day in court,

122
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,498
fishing a half a dozen random
case files out of a wire basket,

123
00:09:09,534 --> 00:09:13,368
meets with his clients for a half hour
before going in front of the judge,

124
00:09:13,404 --> 00:09:15,003
takes the first deal off it,

125
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:17,839
goes around the corner to Starbucks,
comes back with his latte,

126
00:09:17,874 --> 00:09:21,944
opens up the next file, and does the exact
same thing six times a day, every day.

127
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:33,321
Look, I'll take it on for 55,000.

128
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:35,389
Any less than that, it's
Naz who will suffer,

129
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:39,060
since I'll be going up against
the DA armed with nothing.

130
00:09:39,095 --> 00:09:42,497
55?

131
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,777
I'm writing down...

132
00:09:57,746 --> 00:10:01,382
$50,000.

133
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:03,517
This is my retainer.

134
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:07,187
If you can, uh, sign it now,

135
00:10:07,222 --> 00:10:11,692
I can get to work and figure
out a payment schedule later.

136
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,963
I need to read it.

137
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:18,198
Of course. I'll leave it. You
take as long as you need.

138
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:22,768
But know that I can't get to
work on behalf of your son

139
00:10:22,804 --> 00:10:25,372
until you sign it.

140
00:10:36,118 --> 00:10:38,885
<i>You can see why
people liked him so much on his way up.</i>

141
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,654
<i>I was one of them. Rangy.</i>

142
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:45,591
<i>Look how fast his hands are, and
he carries power, confident.</i>

143
00:10:45,627 --> 00:10:49,896
<i>Distance in which they're
fighting in favor of Sillah.</i>

144
00:10:49,931 --> 00:10:52,064
<i>But Kovalev's tming is very good.</i>

145
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:54,033
<i>Another jab to the body.</i>

146
00:10:55,836 --> 00:10:57,936
<i>If and when Kovalev can get going,</i>

147
00:10:57,971 --> 00:11:00,972
<i>he throws four- and five-punch
combinations with all power.</i>

148
00:11:17,624 --> 00:11:19,758
Let's go.

149
00:11:19,793 --> 00:11:21,793
Out!

150
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:23,962
<i>Landed
a right cross moments ago.</i>

151
00:11:23,997 --> 00:11:26,297
<i>Got in another shot there.</i>

152
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,095
Gate!

153
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:10,307
Gate!

154
00:12:22,621 --> 00:12:26,255
Yeah, Freddy!

155
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,559
Yeah! Shit! Uh! Yeah! Yeah!

156
00:12:30,595 --> 00:12:34,997
Oh, God! Yeah! Yeah!

157
00:12:35,032 --> 00:12:37,500
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

158
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,069
Religion?

159
00:12:41,105 --> 00:12:43,205
Baptist.

160
00:12:47,011 --> 00:12:48,977
- Religion?
- Muslim.

161
00:12:52,816 --> 00:12:55,817
- Religion?
<i>- As-salamu alaykum.</i>

162
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:01,222
Oh, come on, man. I can't
eat that other shit.

163
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:03,191
Give me Arab food.

164
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,829
Religion.

165
00:13:15,738 --> 00:13:19,174
- That's it?
- Baby, I can't do this no more.

166
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:21,409
They're bringing in polygraphs.

167
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:26,480
- We still okay?
- Yeah.

168
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:30,584
You don't got to pay my rent
no more if you don't want to.

169
00:13:34,824 --> 00:13:36,924
Take me back.

170
00:13:40,796 --> 00:13:43,730
As per usual, I see
some old faces here.

171
00:13:43,765 --> 00:13:45,365
Glad you learned your lesson.

172
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:48,468
For the freshmen, I'll keep it simple.

173
00:13:48,504 --> 00:13:51,271
You get told to do something, you do it.

174
00:13:51,307 --> 00:13:53,574
You lay a hand on any one of us,

175
00:13:53,609 --> 00:13:57,310
we will break out the riot gear,
put you in the fucking hospital,

176
00:13:57,345 --> 00:13:59,179
and add another charge.

177
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:02,182
So far this year, we've
done this 2,000 times,

178
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:05,318
so you might say we look forward to it.

179
00:14:05,353 --> 00:14:08,421
That's it. Gate!

180
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:18,364
When I call your name,
you're gonna take a bed.

181
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:23,936
Oh!

182
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,977
Williams.

183
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:37,783
Goddamn!

184
00:14:37,818 --> 00:14:40,119
Let's go! Keep the line tight!

185
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,222
Rogers!

186
00:14:47,461 --> 00:14:51,563
Martinez! Brown!

187
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:55,467
Davis!

188
00:14:58,372 --> 00:14:59,937
Holmes!

189
00:15:04,543 --> 00:15:06,577
Khan!

190
00:15:09,115 --> 00:15:11,149
Ortiz, W.

191
00:15:13,219 --> 00:15:16,754
Ortiz, F.

192
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,422
Hernandez!

193
00:15:23,262 --> 00:15:25,562
- Did he do it?
- No question.

194
00:15:25,598 --> 00:15:29,667
- You know who's repping him?
- Actually, that's the best part:

195
00:15:29,702 --> 00:15:32,068
- John Stone.
- Who?

196
00:15:32,104 --> 00:15:35,305
He's no one, a precinct crawler.

197
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,074
- Really?
- Yeah.

198
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:43,413
Still, sex, drugs, and rock
'n' roll, and he's Muslim?

199
00:15:43,448 --> 00:15:46,516
We're on "Nancy Grace" every
night, so fast-track it.

200
00:15:46,551 --> 00:15:50,620
- Get it before the grand jury now.
- Yes, sir.

201
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,832
Johnny.

202
00:16:02,867 --> 00:16:04,500
Helen. How are you?

203
00:16:04,536 --> 00:16:06,602
How are you?

204
00:16:06,638 --> 00:16:08,704
I'm good.

205
00:16:08,739 --> 00:16:11,240
Your son? Work? Your feet?

206
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:14,376
They're fine. Everything's good.

207
00:16:14,411 --> 00:16:18,080
I was really happy when I heard
you were on the Khan case.

208
00:16:18,115 --> 00:16:21,416
- Good for you.
- I'm really happy you're still here.

209
00:16:21,452 --> 00:16:24,185
Where would I go? What would I do?

210
00:16:24,221 --> 00:16:27,989
Spend more time with my grandchildren?
They'd hate that.

211
00:16:30,694 --> 00:16:33,161
What can I do for you?

212
00:16:33,196 --> 00:16:35,163
You know.

213
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:37,499
Oh... it's too soon for that.

214
00:16:37,534 --> 00:16:41,069
Come on. Let's talk.

215
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:49,277
We both know what a
mess this is gonna be.

216
00:16:49,312 --> 00:16:54,548
This is Jodi Arias time, only this is
a good kid, no history of anything.

217
00:16:54,584 --> 00:16:55,850
Let's nip it in the bud.

218
00:16:55,886 --> 00:16:58,419
Jodi didn't have any priors

219
00:16:58,454 --> 00:17:00,388
and slit poor Travis' throat ear-to-ear.

220
00:17:00,423 --> 00:17:03,290
No one slit anyone's throat here.

221
00:17:03,325 --> 00:17:08,496
This girl was stabbed the same number
of times as her age, John, 22.

222
00:17:08,531 --> 00:17:11,632
- She was?
- Mm-hmm.

223
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:14,334
Eh, there you go.

224
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,669
It wasn't my boy, then.
That's a passion job.

225
00:17:16,705 --> 00:17:18,471
The knife was in his pocket.

226
00:17:18,507 --> 00:17:22,376
A knife in the pocket, very
different from the knife.

227
00:17:22,411 --> 00:17:23,743
Cops find the motive there, too?

228
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:26,079
"Please, please don't
rape me" isn't motive?

229
00:17:26,115 --> 00:17:28,681
That's not what happened.
This isn't murder one.

230
00:17:28,717 --> 00:17:31,751
He didn't go out looking.
Whatever happened just happened.

231
00:17:31,787 --> 00:17:33,553
He's as clean as Donny Osmond.

232
00:17:33,588 --> 00:17:37,590
Didn't Donny Osmond get
into some sort of trouble?

233
00:17:37,626 --> 00:17:39,526
- Did he?
- Didn't he?

234
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:41,928
I don't think so. In any
case, why take the chance

235
00:17:41,963 --> 00:17:45,197
this turns into Abu Ghraib?
Let's work something out.

236
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:46,966
The Muslim part is only helpful.

237
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:48,734
Not if there's one Muslim on the jury,

238
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:51,103
and there's no way you'll
keep them all off.

239
00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:53,572
I'll take as many as I can get.

240
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:56,809
They're not gonna like what this
is gonna do to their community.

241
00:17:56,844 --> 00:17:59,979
- Manslaughter.
- Excuse me?

242
00:18:00,014 --> 00:18:04,049
- Let's get it off your desk.
- Johnny, it's homicide.

243
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,984
There's no way around it.

244
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:07,686
There's nothing I can do for you.
I'm sorry.

245
00:18:07,721 --> 00:18:10,322
Just give me something back.

246
00:18:11,492 --> 00:18:13,425
Anything.

247
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:23,134
There's a tailor I know on 33rd Street.

248
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,503
Very reasonable.

249
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:28,573
I mean this sincerely.

250
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:32,978
Get something for the trial, not brown.

251
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:51,195
Salim...

252
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,531
Did you hear what I said?

253
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:56,900
No.

254
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:59,403
Where is it?

255
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,739
Where is what?

256
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,976
The cab.

257
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:10,981
I don't know.

258
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:16,052
Have you asked anybody?
Have you called anybody?

259
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:18,688
My son is in prison.

260
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:22,025
I know. I still have to make a living.

261
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,127
I can't afford not to be working.

262
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:25,661
Yusuf can't.

263
00:19:25,696 --> 00:19:29,499
Every day that goes by, we're
losing money that we need.

264
00:19:30,668 --> 00:19:33,102
I know.

265
00:19:52,489 --> 00:19:54,322
You see, right now,

266
00:19:54,358 --> 00:19:56,959
everybody taking a hard look at you.

267
00:19:57,995 --> 00:20:00,295
You just let them look.

268
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,397
Anybody asks you anything,

269
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:04,899
you keep your head
down, your mouth shut,

270
00:20:04,935 --> 00:20:06,601
and your business to yourself.

271
00:20:06,636 --> 00:20:09,237
'Cause they just probing for weakness.

272
00:20:10,907 --> 00:20:13,942
- You hear me?
- Yeah.

273
00:20:19,115 --> 00:20:20,615
So, what are you in for?

274
00:20:21,751 --> 00:20:23,551
Um, they're accusing me of...

275
00:20:23,587 --> 00:20:26,320
Motherfucker, what'd I just tell you?!

276
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,745
Are you wearing perfume?

277
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,848
Cologne, Paco Rabanne, for men.

278
00:21:28,883 --> 00:21:32,484
Yes, I know it's for men. Uh, where?

279
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,355
Around my ankles, to counteract
the smell of the Neosporin.

280
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:39,090
Neosporin smells like maple syrup.
What's wrong with that?

281
00:21:39,126 --> 00:21:40,559
At the pancake house, nothing.

282
00:21:40,594 --> 00:21:43,662
And if I told you it's
an allergic reaction

283
00:21:43,697 --> 00:21:45,730
to cologne that's hastening the spread?

284
00:21:45,766 --> 00:21:48,600
Then that would be ironic.

285
00:21:48,636 --> 00:21:49,861
Taking your antihistamines?

286
00:21:49,886 --> 00:21:52,538
I can't. They knock me out
halfway into the next day.

287
00:21:52,573 --> 00:21:54,438
Do you want to get better or not?

288
00:21:54,474 --> 00:21:55,266
I do. I just...

289
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,642
Then throw out the Paco
Rabanne and the chopsticks.

290
00:21:57,678 --> 00:21:59,610
Start taking your antihistamines.

291
00:21:59,646 --> 00:22:02,080
Pick up some Saran Wrap and Crisco.

292
00:22:02,115 --> 00:22:07,485
Apply a large dollop to each foot
morning and night and wrap them up.

293
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,255
You're kidding, right? I can't
walk around in public like that.

294
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:14,124
Saran Wrap is clear. No
one will even notice.

295
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,694
Do it, come back and see me in a week,

296
00:22:16,729 --> 00:22:20,030
and we will marvel together
at the improvement.

297
00:22:23,069 --> 00:22:27,137
Why not some WD-40 and
a Glad cinch sack?

298
00:22:27,173 --> 00:22:32,042
We're not only going after the so-called
doctor who mauled Ms. Hahn's face,

299
00:22:32,078 --> 00:22:34,945
but also the airline that fired
her because, as they put it,

300
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,816
the results made it too disturbing for
the passengers to interact with her.

301
00:22:38,851 --> 00:22:42,419
But the surgery
was voluntary, wasn't it?

302
00:22:42,454 --> 00:22:46,956
You're a stewardess who served your
employer faithfully for 25 years.

303
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:50,793
After awarding your silver wings
for a quarter-century of service,

304
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:53,296
they start dropping hints
like confetti that you need

305
00:22:53,332 --> 00:22:55,298
to start keeping up your appearance,

306
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:59,536
the "or else" as implicit
as a storm cloud.

307
00:22:59,571 --> 00:23:02,238
So you, husbandless, childless,

308
00:23:02,273 --> 00:23:05,507
and in terror of losing the job
you've devoted your life to,

309
00:23:05,543 --> 00:23:07,543
do what you know you have to do,

310
00:23:07,578 --> 00:23:10,579
what any woman over the age of
40 who deals with the public

311
00:23:10,615 --> 00:23:12,581
to earn a living has to do,

312
00:23:12,617 --> 00:23:16,119
what a reporter who works
for Channel 7 News,

313
00:23:16,154 --> 00:23:18,621
before you know it, will have to do.

314
00:23:18,656 --> 00:23:21,823
So was it voluntary?

315
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,526
You tell me.

316
00:23:24,562 --> 00:23:27,129
<i>Put all
prohibited items in the lockers.</i>

317
00:23:27,164 --> 00:23:30,899
<i>weapons, cell phones,</i>

318
00:23:30,934 --> 00:23:33,034
<i>belts, keys</i>

319
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,109
<i>key rings, nail
clippers,pens, pencils...</i>

320
00:23:36,133 --> 00:23:37,738
Good. Next.

321
00:23:37,775 --> 00:23:39,941
Arms out, please.

322
00:23:39,977 --> 00:23:42,244
Pat you down.

323
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:44,646
<i>...lighters, matches...</i>

324
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:45,847
Okay. Thank you.

325
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,215
Good. Stand right here.

326
00:23:47,251 --> 00:23:48,516
Arms out.

327
00:23:51,321 --> 00:23:52,787
Got anything in your pockets?

328
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,808
- Name?
- Mine?

329
00:24:13,843 --> 00:24:15,375
No.

330
00:24:15,411 --> 00:24:17,511
Who I'm visiting?

331
00:24:18,948 --> 00:24:21,448
Nasir Khan.

332
00:24:21,483 --> 00:24:25,452
- Spell it.
- N-a-s-i-r...

333
00:24:25,487 --> 00:24:27,788
...K-h-a-n.

334
00:24:33,495 --> 00:24:35,495
I need another one for my wife.

335
00:24:35,531 --> 00:24:37,997
Tell her to get in line.

336
00:24:42,637 --> 00:24:44,070
You need to check in too.

337
00:24:51,512 --> 00:24:53,746
Arms out.

338
00:24:58,118 --> 00:25:00,886
Lift your blouse.

339
00:25:02,457 --> 00:25:04,724
<i>...hands above the table.</i>

340
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:06,759
<i>You are not permitted
to exchange any item</i>

341
00:25:06,794 --> 00:25:08,260
<i>with the person you are visiting...</i>

342
00:25:08,295 --> 00:25:10,195
All the way.

343
00:25:12,366 --> 00:25:15,433
<i>At the completion of
your visit, you must remain seated</i>

344
00:25:15,469 --> 00:25:18,436
<i>until the person you are visiting...</i>

345
00:25:44,564 --> 00:25:46,630
I liked her.

346
00:25:47,934 --> 00:25:50,201
She liked me.

347
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:54,038
We drank.

348
00:25:55,408 --> 00:25:58,009
We went to bed.

349
00:25:58,044 --> 00:26:02,813
Woke up in the kitchen. I
don't remember going there.

350
00:26:03,883 --> 00:26:07,150
I went back upstairs to the bedroom.

351
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:14,090
I didn't kill her.

352
00:26:14,126 --> 00:26:16,259
Even if you can't remember
anything, you'd know that.

353
00:26:16,295 --> 00:26:20,397
You'd feel it, right? I don't.

354
00:26:20,432 --> 00:26:24,467
- I'm not a murderer.
- Of course you're not.

355
00:26:24,502 --> 00:26:26,536
I'm so sorry I did this to you.

356
00:26:26,571 --> 00:26:30,506
Listen, you
didn't do anything, huh?

357
00:26:30,542 --> 00:26:34,110
The jury, they'll see
right past, uh, the...

358
00:26:34,146 --> 00:26:39,849
the so-called evidence and the lawyers
and all this, and they'll see you.

359
00:26:49,461 --> 00:26:52,962
At, uh, 2:30 a.m. Saturday morning,

360
00:26:52,997 --> 00:26:55,497
a 22-year-old woman, Andrea Cornish,

361
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:59,634
was found stabbed to death in
her home on West 87th Street.

362
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:02,438
Less than a quarter-mile
away from the murder scene,

363
00:27:02,473 --> 00:27:05,841
a 23-year-old male, Nasir Khan,

364
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:09,177
was detained by officers
on suspicion of DUI.

365
00:27:09,212 --> 00:27:13,715
While in custody, a knife believed to be
the murder weapon was found on his person.

366
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:18,720
Additional forensic evidence and eyewitness
accounts further tie him to the crime.

367
00:27:18,755 --> 00:27:24,558
He has been formally charged with
murder and was arraigned earlier today.

368
00:27:24,594 --> 00:27:26,260
<i>What
was their relationship?</i>

369
00:27:26,296 --> 00:27:28,262
<i>That's under investigation.</i>

370
00:27:28,298 --> 00:27:30,398
<i>Do you have
a motive for the killing?</i>

371
00:27:30,433 --> 00:27:32,233
<i>At this point, it looks
sexual in nature,</i>

372
00:27:32,268 --> 00:27:35,069
<i>but that, too, is under investigation.</i>

373
00:27:35,105 --> 00:27:37,771
<i>Is the suspect a citizen?</i>

374
00:27:37,807 --> 00:27:39,673
<i>The records show
he was born here, yes.</i>

375
00:27:39,709 --> 00:27:40,492
Thank you.

376
00:27:40,517 --> 00:27:42,842
<i>But he's Muslim.
Is that right?</i>

377
00:27:42,877 --> 00:27:46,413
<i>- We understand he is.</i>
<i>- Does he have ties</i>

378
00:27:46,448 --> 00:27:48,214
<i>to any foreign organizations?</i>

379
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,150
<i>That's under investigation.</i>

380
00:27:50,185 --> 00:27:54,154
Organizations. What organizations?
What are they saying?

381
00:27:54,189 --> 00:27:56,556
You know what they are saying.

382
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,025
<i>Does he have a
history of violent crimes?</i>

383
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,326
<i>That, too,
is under investigation.</i>

384
00:28:01,362 --> 00:28:03,863
<i>That's all I have for you right now.
I'll update you</i>

385
00:28:03,898 --> 00:28:05,865
when we have more information.
Thank you.

386
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,007
Hey, come here.

387
00:28:15,043 --> 00:28:18,977
Got something to say, okay?
You ready? You rolling?

388
00:28:19,012 --> 00:28:23,014
"Foreign organizations."
They're doing this already.

389
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,649
My client was born here.

390
00:28:24,685 --> 00:28:27,719
<i>He's as American as baseball.</i>
Detective Williams, please.

391
00:28:27,754 --> 00:28:31,256
<i>What are they gonna do next, look
at the Chechen extremist groups?</i>

392
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:35,060
<i>-What are we, in Boston?</i>
- Can you do something for me?

393
00:28:35,095 --> 00:28:40,164
This Khan kid killer, I would really
love the family's home address.

394
00:29:05,424 --> 00:29:07,124
You rape that girl?

395
00:29:08,594 --> 00:29:09,860
No.

396
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:28,978
- From Freddy.
- Who?

397
00:29:33,418 --> 00:29:34,817
What for?

398
00:29:37,389 --> 00:29:39,355
Traction.

399
00:30:55,832 --> 00:30:56,864
Yeah. It's here.

400
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:58,298
Great. What do we pay?

401
00:30:58,334 --> 00:30:59,700
Nothing till it's released.

402
00:30:59,736 --> 00:31:01,602
That's why we're here.

403
00:31:01,637 --> 00:31:02,936
You can't have it now.

404
00:31:02,971 --> 00:31:04,638
If you'd have called, I
could have told you that.

405
00:31:04,673 --> 00:31:06,440
Well, we have to come
back to get it. When?

406
00:31:06,475 --> 00:31:08,808
After the trial, or never.

407
00:31:08,844 --> 00:31:12,078
- Excuse me?
- It's your cab?

408
00:31:12,114 --> 00:31:16,049
It's ours, the three of us all together.

409
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:18,284
Then you should all get lawyers.

410
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:19,685
What are you talking about?

411
00:31:19,721 --> 00:31:21,855
The cab was used in the
commission of a crime,

412
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:25,225
which means the state can sue in
order to keep it in a civil court.

413
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,093
Sue? Sue who?

414
00:31:27,129 --> 00:31:28,862
You, the registered owners.

415
00:31:28,897 --> 00:31:30,830
But the suit won't get filed
until the criminal trial

416
00:31:30,866 --> 00:31:32,665
and however many months that'll take,

417
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,301
which I could have told you over the
phone if you'd have called first.

418
00:31:35,336 --> 00:31:36,835
- Months?
- Or longer.

419
00:31:36,871 --> 00:31:39,405
Slow wheels of justice and all.
And I hate to say it,

420
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,508
but you'll probably lose in civil court.

421
00:31:42,543 --> 00:31:46,979
Unless, uh... which of you is Khan?

422
00:31:47,014 --> 00:31:49,749
Him.

423
00:31:51,685 --> 00:31:54,719
- Is it your relative, sir?
- What?

424
00:31:54,755 --> 00:31:57,355
- Is it your relative who's been charged?
- Yes. My son.

425
00:31:57,391 --> 00:31:59,557
Did he have permission
from you to drive the cab?

426
00:31:59,593 --> 00:32:01,326
Not really.

427
00:32:01,361 --> 00:32:02,795
Well, then that's your out.

428
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,629
You might have a chance
with that if you don't mind

429
00:32:04,665 --> 00:32:05,798
filing charges, grand theft.

430
00:32:05,833 --> 00:32:09,701
File charges against my son?
You're crazy.

431
00:32:09,736 --> 00:32:13,037
Hey, I'm just trying
to help you guys out.

432
00:32:17,177 --> 00:32:19,010
I'm no lawyer, but if he won't do it,

433
00:32:19,045 --> 00:32:22,180
it doesn't mean you guys can't give
it a shot since you're co-owners.

434
00:32:22,215 --> 00:32:26,150
- Do you have an attorney?
- No.

435
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:33,657
Make sure you tell him I gave
you this card. Good luck, man.

436
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:36,651
- How goes it, guys?
- All quiet on the Western Front.

437
00:33:36,687 --> 00:33:39,755
- Anyone still working in there?
- No. Done by all appearances.

438
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:42,258
- That was fast.
- It's all right.

439
00:33:42,293 --> 00:33:46,961
Here you go. I come bearing gifts.

440
00:34:39,581 --> 00:34:41,748
Don't worry. I
won't put you on YouTube.

441
00:34:41,783 --> 00:34:45,652
Don't even joke around like that.
Come on.

442
00:34:48,223 --> 00:34:52,425
- Can I open it?
- I didn't say you could.

443
00:35:17,551 --> 00:35:18,750
Check the fridge.

444
00:35:18,786 --> 00:35:21,120
You check the fridge.

445
00:35:35,402 --> 00:35:37,135
Here you go.

446
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:50,106
Chandra. That's right, isn't it?

447
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:53,042
- Yes.
- Come here.

448
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:58,013
- Crowe and Associates.
- Where you from?

449
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,849
- Um, Baltimore.
- Your parents.

450
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:05,454
- Mumbai.
- Close enough.

451
00:37:07,324 --> 00:37:10,536
_

452
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,810
_

453
00:37:13,302 --> 00:37:14,724
_

454
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:17,245
_

455
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:22,404
I was just saying
that she's very pretty.

456
00:37:22,439 --> 00:37:24,473
She is, and very smart.

457
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:28,042
Can I ask you how much you
know about Mr. Stone?

458
00:37:28,078 --> 00:37:29,644
Nothing.

459
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:32,114
Well, there isn't much
more than that to know.

460
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:35,283
Basically, Mr. Stone represents
drug dealers and prostitutes.

461
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:39,687
That's the world he lives in. And when
I say "represents," I mean pleads.

462
00:37:39,723 --> 00:37:42,090
He already said something
about that to us,

463
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:43,890
and I said, "What? Plead?"

464
00:37:43,926 --> 00:37:46,159
Well, that's because he doesn't
want to be in a courtroom

465
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:48,795
any more than a courtroom
wants him in it.

466
00:37:48,831 --> 00:37:53,266
Mr. Stone is not a trial lawyer.
He's barely a lawyer.

467
00:37:53,301 --> 00:37:55,201
He wants his fee, wants
things over fast,

468
00:37:55,237 --> 00:37:58,204
and then onto the next
case, which works for him,

469
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,939
but does it work for his clients?

470
00:37:59,974 --> 00:38:03,109
Well, they'll never know.
They're in jail.

471
00:38:03,145 --> 00:38:04,944
I didn't get a good
feeling from this man.

472
00:38:04,979 --> 00:38:06,712
You have good instincts.

473
00:38:06,748 --> 00:38:10,216
And your son deserves better than someone
who's never tried a murder case.

474
00:38:10,252 --> 00:38:13,119
Did he ask you to sign anything?

475
00:38:13,155 --> 00:38:15,054
He tried, but I didn't sign it.

476
00:38:15,089 --> 00:38:16,889
He left it, there.

477
00:38:16,924 --> 00:38:18,457
- A retainer?
- Yeah.

478
00:38:18,492 --> 00:38:21,493
Did he say how much he
wanted to charge you?

479
00:38:21,529 --> 00:38:23,195
- $50,000.
- Flat?

480
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:28,167
- Excuse me?
- Flat fee, like, um, early-bird parking.

481
00:38:28,202 --> 00:38:31,336
I'm sorry, but just from
what I know right now,

482
00:38:31,372 --> 00:38:34,540
this case could easily
cost five times that,

483
00:38:34,575 --> 00:38:37,342
and anyone who tells you
any different is lying.

484
00:38:37,378 --> 00:38:39,678
- Five times that?
Uh-huh.

485
00:38:39,713 --> 00:38:43,715
But I will do it for nothing.

486
00:38:45,952 --> 00:38:48,853
Which is why I didn't come here
with a retainer in my hand.

487
00:38:48,889 --> 00:38:50,655
Because this is the kind of case

488
00:38:50,691 --> 00:38:55,293
that reminds me why I wanted
to be a lawyer to begin with.

489
00:38:55,328 --> 00:38:58,663
And it'll get the full
attention of my firm

490
00:38:58,699 --> 00:39:02,967
and all of my resources,
including Chandra.

491
00:39:10,276 --> 00:39:13,344
_

492
00:39:14,847 --> 00:39:15,913
Thank you.

493
00:39:17,517 --> 00:39:19,617
Thank you.

494
00:39:22,354 --> 00:39:24,654
It's spreading, and you
haven't gone back to the clinic?

495
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:26,423
- Nope.
- Why not?

496
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:29,793
'Cause I'm sick of clinics.
I'm sick of doctors.

497
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:32,129
I'm sick of waiting rooms,
sick of all the bullshit,

498
00:39:32,164 --> 00:39:35,632
"Wrap it in this," "Soak it in
that," "Try this cream, that cream,

499
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:40,537
this air purifier, that new study
that says," blah, blah, blah.

500
00:39:40,572 --> 00:39:45,308
You know, I think my flare-ups are an
allergic reaction to my dermatologist.

501
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:50,647
Go ahead, Steve.
I got some good news.

502
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:56,252
Since the last time, I decided to
jump back into the dating pool.

503
00:39:59,791 --> 00:40:01,557
How's that going for you?

504
00:40:01,592 --> 00:40:04,160
I got to tell you, I'm holding my own.

505
00:40:04,195 --> 00:40:07,630
That's not exactly the best
choice of words there, Steve.

506
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:14,236
I'm... I'm kidding.
More power to you, brother.

507
00:40:14,272 --> 00:40:16,104
- And how you doing, John?
- Me?

508
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:20,976
You know, I'm holding my own.

509
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:26,448
<i>He drug you down the street by your hair</i>

510
00:40:26,484 --> 00:40:30,018
<i>and brought you back to the
house, and you're pregnant.</i>

511
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:31,653
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- Did you do that?</i>

512
00:40:31,688 --> 00:40:34,823
<i>- I don't remember that.</i>
<i>- Wait, wait, wait.</i>

513
00:40:34,858 --> 00:40:38,260
<i>The question is not
whether you remember it.</i>

514
00:40:38,295 --> 00:40:41,096
<i>Did someone tell you that you did it?</i>

515
00:40:41,131 --> 00:40:44,599
<i>Were you drunk, and that's why
you don't remember perhaps?</i>

516
00:40:44,634 --> 00:40:47,201
<i>Was he intoxicated when he did this?</i>

517
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,069
<i>Yeah, yeah. He used to...</i>

518
00:40:49,105 --> 00:40:53,140
<i>He's different now, but back then...</i>

519
00:40:53,176 --> 00:40:55,777
- No, no red.
- Yeah.

520
00:40:55,812 --> 00:40:57,144
No blue, either, no.

521
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:01,048
No black, no yellow, 'cause
those are gang colors.

522
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,184
You know what I mean? And, uh...
you know what?

523
00:41:03,219 --> 00:41:05,519
I'll take an extra pair of socks
'cause he could always use it.

524
00:41:05,554 --> 00:41:07,054
- Okay.
- Okay.

525
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:11,491
- Right there. All right?
- Mm.

526
00:41:11,527 --> 00:41:13,593
- $40.
- All right. It's a bargain.

527
00:41:13,629 --> 00:41:15,595
- Thank you.
- Take it easy, all right, my friend?

528
00:41:15,631 --> 00:41:18,097
Okay. Power to you, baby. I love you.

529
00:41:18,133 --> 00:41:20,801
<i>We talked to
another attorney, a real attorney.</i>

530
00:41:20,836 --> 00:41:24,604
<i>She's going to take over.</i>
So, what about Mr. Stone?

531
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,575
<i>What about him? Forget about him.
He's not good.</i>

532
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,076
How do you know?

533
00:41:30,111 --> 00:41:31,911
<i>Now, the first thing he said to us was,</i>

534
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:34,113
<i>"Here's how much this is going to cost."</i>

535
00:41:34,149 --> 00:41:36,382
<i>That's all he cares about.</i>

536
00:41:36,417 --> 00:41:39,552
<i>This new attorney doesn't
want anything, only to help.</i>

537
00:41:39,587 --> 00:41:41,287
- Why?
<i>-Why?</i>

538
00:41:41,323 --> 00:41:43,789
- Why?
- <i>Because she can afford to.</i>

539
00:41:43,825 --> 00:41:46,125
<i>She makes enough money
defending rich people.</i>

540
00:41:46,161 --> 00:41:49,462
<i>She is a very big lawyer.</i>

541
00:41:49,497 --> 00:41:52,297
Baba, I kind of like Mr. Stone.

542
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:55,300
<i>Like him? What's there to like?</i>

543
00:41:55,336 --> 00:41:58,437
<i>It doesn't matter. This is
what's happening, and it's good.</i>

544
00:41:58,473 --> 00:42:01,173
<i>We are very lucky.</i>

545
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:11,716
Turn around.

546
00:42:23,764 --> 00:42:27,899
A little to the left, Sean.

547
00:42:27,934 --> 00:42:32,136
You want to see your fucking client,
or you want us to toss your ass out?

548
00:42:32,171 --> 00:42:34,472
Sorry.

549
00:42:34,508 --> 00:42:37,275
Grab your stuff.

550
00:42:40,146 --> 00:42:41,946
How's the feet?

551
00:42:41,981 --> 00:42:44,415
So, hey, I brought you some clothes.

552
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:46,117
You can collect them after.

553
00:42:46,152 --> 00:42:47,851
Did your folks put some
money in your account?

554
00:42:47,887 --> 00:42:49,887
Uh, no. I don't think they knew to.

555
00:42:49,923 --> 00:42:53,757
Well, I'll make a deposit for you.
You need money in here.

556
00:42:53,793 --> 00:42:56,927
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

557
00:42:56,962 --> 00:42:58,562
Okay. Good.

558
00:42:58,597 --> 00:43:01,865
So, I, uh, I talked to the DA.

559
00:43:01,901 --> 00:43:04,435
They're moving forward,
which is to be expected,

560
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:07,037
but that doesn't mean
they won't deal later.

561
00:43:07,072 --> 00:43:10,006
All we can do is wait to see
exactly what they have,

562
00:43:10,042 --> 00:43:12,443
which we'll find out once
there's a grand jury.

563
00:43:12,478 --> 00:43:14,311
You're not my lawyer anymore.

564
00:43:15,847 --> 00:43:17,480
Excuse me?

565
00:43:17,515 --> 00:43:20,817
My parents, they hired somebody else.

566
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,987
Really?

567
00:43:25,357 --> 00:43:29,125
- Who?
- Um, Alison somebody.

568
00:43:29,161 --> 00:43:32,528
Alison somebody? Crowe?

569
00:43:32,564 --> 00:43:35,264
I don't know.

570
00:43:35,299 --> 00:43:37,600
That figures.

571
00:43:37,635 --> 00:43:39,435
Well, okay.

572
00:43:39,471 --> 00:43:41,403
I'm really sorry.

573
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:44,707
No, no, no. I understand.
This is, you know...

574
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:48,577
This is important, so...

575
00:43:48,612 --> 00:43:52,281
Okay, look, whatever.

576
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,457
Here's my number.

577
00:44:01,492 --> 00:44:04,359
Anytime you...

578
00:44:04,394 --> 00:44:07,796
you want to call me, day
or night, for anything.

579
00:44:12,803 --> 00:44:14,469
Thank you.

580
00:44:21,478 --> 00:44:24,578
You got to leave first. I
can't go until you do.

581
00:44:28,551 --> 00:44:30,851
I think we're done here.

582
00:44:32,355 --> 00:44:35,756
Hey, can I give you some
last-minute advice?

583
00:44:42,097 --> 00:44:44,297
I can't think of any.

584
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:46,600
You'll be okay.

585
00:45:12,727 --> 00:45:14,827
- Mr. Stone?
- Huh?

586
00:45:14,863 --> 00:45:18,731
I'm Chandra Kapoor. I'm working with Ms.
Crowe on the Khan case.

587
00:45:18,767 --> 00:45:21,034
- Okay. Let's go see her.
- Um, actually,

588
00:45:21,069 --> 00:45:25,404
she's asked me to tell you she's
sorry, but she's left for the day.

589
00:45:27,007 --> 00:45:30,309
- Chandra, huh?
- Mm-hm.

590
00:45:30,344 --> 00:45:32,311
Your boss is too much.

591
00:45:32,346 --> 00:45:34,380
I'm sorry. I'm not sure what that means.

592
00:45:34,415 --> 00:45:38,584
You do. She took you with her
when she stole my client.

593
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:40,752
- Tell me I'm wrong.
- She didn't steal anyone, Mr. Stone.

594
00:45:40,788 --> 00:45:45,624
She did. But I'm talking about you now.

595
00:45:46,794 --> 00:45:49,628
Is that what you went to law school for,

596
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:52,798
to be a prop, Ms. Kapoor?

597
00:45:58,472 --> 00:46:01,573
Is there a message you'd
like me to give Ms. Crowe?

598
00:46:04,877 --> 00:46:08,079
You know what the message is.

599
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:21,050
Sorry.

600
00:47:21,085 --> 00:47:24,519
Can't take you. Allergic.

601
00:47:42,439 --> 00:47:45,472
He wants to see you.

602
00:47:45,508 --> 00:47:47,541
Who?

603
00:47:52,181 --> 00:47:54,615
Come on. Let's go.

604
00:48:29,384 --> 00:48:30,617
Come on.

605
00:49:01,047 --> 00:49:03,014
Have a seat.

606
00:49:13,827 --> 00:49:16,961
That guard, Tito,

607
00:49:16,997 --> 00:49:21,032
his daughter's having her
<i>quinceañera</i> this weekend.

608
00:49:22,568 --> 00:49:25,202
That's a sweet 16, only 15.

609
00:49:26,939 --> 00:49:29,940
But the dude lives in Brownsville, man,

610
00:49:29,975 --> 00:49:32,843
as shitty a hood as they come.

611
00:49:32,878 --> 00:49:36,280
So I said, "Man, you should be
concerned about the local thugs

612
00:49:36,316 --> 00:49:40,383
crashing the thing,
getting high, fighting.

613
00:49:40,419 --> 00:49:44,154
Next thing you know, somebody's squeezing
off shots, don't care who they hit."

614
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:48,192
You know, I said, "I couldn't
guarantee that won't happen,

615
00:49:48,227 --> 00:49:50,660
but I could make a few phone calls,

616
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:53,297
see if I can help out with that."

617
00:49:54,266 --> 00:49:57,033
That's what that little
thank you is for.

618
00:49:58,437 --> 00:50:02,972
You see, us and the guards,
we all from the same hood.

619
00:50:03,007 --> 00:50:05,842
Some of us even grew up together.

620
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:08,778
They know our families. We know theirs.

621
00:50:08,814 --> 00:50:11,080
Family's everything, right?

622
00:50:12,683 --> 00:50:15,184
It is in a Muslim family.

623
00:50:16,687 --> 00:50:18,254
Yeah.

624
00:50:19,858 --> 00:50:22,524
I'll tell you something, man.

625
00:50:29,467 --> 00:50:34,236
See those brothers you pray
with, the Nation of Islam?

626
00:50:34,271 --> 00:50:36,605
They're not your friends.

627
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,175
In fact, they hate your ass because
you're a natural-born Muslim,

628
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:45,513
and they're just phony jailhouse
opportunists looking for better food.

629
00:50:45,548 --> 00:50:51,086
Don't know the difference between
Cairo, Egypt, or Cairo, Illinois.

630
00:50:51,121 --> 00:50:53,154
I'm Pakistani, not Egyptian.

631
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:55,955
Yeah, well, my ancestors
came from Dahomey

632
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:58,426
and not the Congo, but
who gives a fuck, man?

633
00:50:58,461 --> 00:51:03,531
See, you're a celebrity in here,
and I'm not talking the good kind.

634
00:51:03,566 --> 00:51:07,702
Dude kills four guys over some dope.
Okay.

635
00:51:09,406 --> 00:51:12,373
But murder a girl? Rape a girl?

636
00:51:12,409 --> 00:51:15,109
- I didn't.
- Doesn't matter.

637
00:51:15,144 --> 00:51:16,811
It makes no difference.

638
00:51:16,846 --> 00:51:20,580
See, there's a whole separate
judicial system in here,

639
00:51:20,616 --> 00:51:23,650
and you just been judged and juried,

640
00:51:23,685 --> 00:51:26,120
and it didn't come out good for you.

641
00:51:37,666 --> 00:51:39,900
Close your eyes.

642
00:51:43,439 --> 00:51:46,139
Close your eyes, I said.

643
00:52:03,458 --> 00:52:05,458
Give me your hand.

644
00:52:08,663 --> 00:52:11,430
Don't be afraid, Nasir.

645
00:52:25,645 --> 00:52:27,879
It feels good, right?

646
00:52:28,815 --> 00:52:30,882
Like silk.

647
00:52:32,819 --> 00:52:34,652
What is it?

648
00:52:38,658 --> 00:52:40,092
It's meat.

649
00:52:40,127 --> 00:52:42,360
You wish.

650
00:52:42,395 --> 00:52:44,963
It's somebody's heart.

651
00:52:44,998 --> 00:52:51,035
Yeah, it's meat,
but the best kind, veal.

652
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:54,405
- Your people eat veal, right?
- Sometimes.

653
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,209
Ah, but only blessed, right?

654
00:52:58,244 --> 00:53:01,645
- I respect that.
- Thank you.

655
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,749
Listen to you, all polite and shit.

656
00:53:14,326 --> 00:53:18,729
See, the reason it feels like silk
is because from the day it's born,

657
00:53:18,764 --> 00:53:22,132
they keep it in a dark crate,

658
00:53:22,167 --> 00:53:25,569
so small they can't even turn around.

659
00:53:25,604 --> 00:53:29,973
And it stays there,
half-blind in the dark,

660
00:53:30,009 --> 00:53:34,610
drinking baby formula, waiting to die.

661
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:50,259
There are some bad people in here,

662
00:53:50,294 --> 00:53:52,595
but I could protect you.

663
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:57,132
Nasir, do you want my protection?

664
00:53:59,203 --> 00:54:01,671
Or do you prefer dead in the shower,

665
00:54:01,706 --> 00:54:03,005
with your brains bashed in,

666
00:54:03,041 --> 00:54:06,075
guts on the floor?

667
00:54:12,116 --> 00:54:14,249
It's up to you.

668
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:38,973
What'd he say?

669
00:54:39,008 --> 00:54:42,176
He offered to help me in here.

670
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:45,946
- And you said?
- I didn't.

671
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:48,983
Are you crazy?

672
00:54:49,018 --> 00:54:51,552
Freddy wiggles five
fingers up on that tier,

673
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:54,387
and five people are dead in the Bronx.

674
00:54:54,423 --> 00:54:59,927
Whatever he's offering, you got
to take it, no discussion.

675
00:54:59,962 --> 00:55:02,830
Otherwise, you are dead.

676
00:55:05,467 --> 00:55:07,668
No.

677
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:25,752
I don't know. People like,
uh, you know, purebreds

678
00:55:25,787 --> 00:55:27,887
or, uh, really pretty cats.

679
00:55:27,922 --> 00:55:30,256
This is what I would call a, uh...

680
00:55:30,291 --> 00:55:34,160
- Ugly cat.
- Yeah. Yeah, kind of.

681
00:55:34,195 --> 00:55:36,929
- I got to sign anything or, uh...
- Nope.

682
00:55:36,965 --> 00:55:40,733
- All right, well, thanks.
- Yeah. You bet.

683
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:47,439
How long you keep them before you,

684
00:55:47,475 --> 00:55:50,876
you know, gas them or whatever?

685
00:55:50,911 --> 00:55:54,547
- Out of curiosity.
- Ten days.

686
00:57:23,968 --> 00:57:26,168
- You fucking pussy!
- Get him, man!

687
00:58:04,273 --> 00:58:07,341

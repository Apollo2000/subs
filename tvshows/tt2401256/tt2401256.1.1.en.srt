Stokes' theorem is the remarkable statement

3
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:40,436
that the line integral of F along C

4
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,871
is equal to the flux integral

5
00:01:42,906 --> 00:01:46,108
of the curl of F through the surface S,

6
00:01:46,142 --> 00:01:49,378
which we know is the surface integral

7
00:01:49,412 --> 00:01:54,516
of the normal component of
the curl along the surface S.

8
00:01:57,754 --> 00:01:59,488
Up top! Up top!

9
00:01:59,522 --> 00:02:00,656
Layup!

10
00:02:01,758 --> 00:02:02,791
Pass!

11
00:02:02,826 --> 00:02:04,226
Yo, Ref!

12
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,195
Here I go, here I go!

13
00:02:07,263 --> 00:02:08,564
Got the shot.

14
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:10,199
Whoo!

15
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,371
I am not doing this.

16
00:02:15,438 --> 00:02:17,373
All right, but it's definitely
gonna be on the test,

17
00:02:17,407 --> 00:02:19,575
so you should look at it at least once.

18
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:22,211
Nah, man, fuck it. 'Cause I gotta go.

19
00:02:22,245 --> 00:02:25,114
All right, you wanna take the book
home? Look at it over the weekend?

20
00:02:25,148 --> 00:02:26,548
Call me if you get stuck or whatever.

21
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:27,716
On a weekend?

22
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:29,618
You gotta be kidding me.

23
00:02:29,652 --> 00:02:31,954
It's just, uh, it's just one chapter.

24
00:02:31,988 --> 00:02:33,122
It's not that hard.

25
00:02:33,156 --> 00:02:35,424
The guy's trying to help
you, man, just take the book.

26
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,159
I'm not taking the book.

27
00:02:37,193 --> 00:02:38,494
You almost done, man?

28
00:02:38,528 --> 00:02:39,895
Uh, yeah, almost.

29
00:02:39,929 --> 00:02:40,996
Yeah.

30
00:02:41,031 --> 00:02:44,500
Hey, man, you wanna party with us tonight?

31
00:02:44,534 --> 00:02:46,301
We're going to my
ex-fiancee's in the city.

32
00:02:46,336 --> 00:02:48,303
Gonna be mad females.

33
00:02:48,338 --> 00:02:50,205
55 Stanton Street.

34
00:02:51,274 --> 00:02:52,574
- My tutor?
- Shut up.

35
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:54,610
He's the only reason
you're still on the team.

36
00:02:54,644 --> 00:02:57,479
Did he say "ex-fiancee"?

37
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:01,116
That's game.

38
00:03:16,785 --> 00:03:20,790
_

39
00:03:25,655 --> 00:03:27,976
_

40
00:03:28,011 --> 00:03:29,878
Shouldn't you be helping
the customers, Auntie?

41
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:34,283
- Hi, Nasir, <i>beta.</i>
- <i>Salaam alaikum,</i> Auntie.

42
00:03:35,218 --> 00:03:36,618
- <i>Salaam alaikum.</i>
- Hi, <i>beta.</i>

43
00:03:36,653 --> 00:03:37,619
Where's your father?

44
00:03:37,654 --> 00:03:38,754
He's outside. You ready?

45
00:03:38,788 --> 00:03:39,655
Yeah. Where's Hasu?

46
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:41,223
Yeah, both outside. He's double-parked.

47
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:43,092
- Okay, okay. Almost done. Almost done.
- _

48
00:03:43,126 --> 00:03:45,327
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

49
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,230
_

50
00:03:49,265 --> 00:03:51,133
That's fine.

51
00:03:54,437 --> 00:03:56,138
Stoudemire has got to stay on the bench.

52
00:03:56,172 --> 00:03:58,073
He can't sit on the bench, man.

53
00:03:58,108 --> 00:04:00,109
You can't build a team around both of them.

54
00:04:00,143 --> 00:04:02,111
You gotta just build a team around Melo.

55
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:04,346
- He's not the same...
- No one else is gonna put up those points.

56
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,547
Yeah, but Melo will.

57
00:04:05,582 --> 00:04:08,317
Okay, but he's not a beast in
the paint like Stoudemire is.

58
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:10,419
So, what are you doing
tonight, <i>baba?</i>

59
00:04:10,453 --> 00:04:13,122
Um, I'm meeting... I got a thing to go to.

60
00:04:13,156 --> 00:04:14,256
- Thing?
- Yeah.

61
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,491
Like a team party downtown.

62
00:04:15,558 --> 00:04:17,693
- Team party? What team?
- Mm-hmm.

63
00:04:17,727 --> 00:04:18,927
The Kings.

64
00:04:18,962 --> 00:04:20,629
- The Kings?
- Yeah.

65
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:26,335
I don't like you going
to something like that.

66
00:04:26,369 --> 00:04:27,603
Like what?

67
00:04:27,637 --> 00:04:29,037
A party like that.

68
00:04:29,072 --> 00:04:30,806
- Downtown.
- Like... like black?

69
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,442
- Hmm?
- Like a black party?

70
00:04:33,476 --> 00:04:34,810
I didn't say that.

71
00:04:36,346 --> 00:04:38,247
Hi, my name's Naz, nice to meet you.

72
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:39,915
Nice to meet you, my name's Naz.

73
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:41,049
I'm on the...

74
00:04:41,084 --> 00:04:42,217
I'm kind of on the team.

75
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:44,353
I'm on the tu... I'm on the
coaching side of the team.

76
00:04:46,923 --> 00:04:48,824
Yo, Amir, where are you, man?

77
00:04:51,794 --> 00:04:53,295
You're kidding me.

78
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:54,796
Nah, nah, nah, listen...

79
00:04:54,831 --> 00:04:56,398
Listen, just borrow your brother's car.

80
00:04:56,432 --> 00:04:58,400
Just borrow it.

81
00:04:58,434 --> 00:05:00,002
Why not?

82
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:01,170
He...

83
00:05:02,338 --> 00:05:04,806
Nah, man, listen, there's
not gonna be other parties.

84
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:05,941
Not like this one, man.

85
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:08,143
You have any idea the kind
of girls are gonna be there?

86
00:05:08,178 --> 00:05:09,978
We are invited. We...

87
00:05:10,013 --> 00:05:12,381
Please, man.

88
00:05:12,415 --> 00:05:14,583
You could have told me an hour ago.

89
00:05:16,886 --> 00:05:19,354
All right, all right.

90
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:20,956
All right, see you tomorrow, man.

91
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,157
You're a punk.

92
00:05:22,192 --> 00:05:23,592
All right, bye.

93
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:32,727
_

94
00:07:14,203 --> 00:07:16,938
Dude, dude, dude, hey,
where's Stanton Street?

95
00:07:19,575 --> 00:07:21,243
Up?

96
00:07:25,181 --> 00:07:27,416
I'm off-duty.

97
00:07:35,558 --> 00:07:39,494
Then turn on your off-duty light, asshole!

98
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:41,029
Oh, shit.

99
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:45,767
Oh, fuck.

100
00:08:08,658 --> 00:08:10,726
23rd and 10th, please.

101
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,627
I'm sorry, I can't take you.

102
00:08:12,662 --> 00:08:14,096
- What?
- I can't...

103
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,797
I can't take you. You're
gonna have to get out.

104
00:08:15,832 --> 00:08:17,299
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

105
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,234
Yo, what are you talking about, man?

106
00:08:19,268 --> 00:08:20,402
I can't take you, man.

107
00:08:20,436 --> 00:08:21,803
- What do you mean, you can't take us?
- It's not my cab.

108
00:08:21,838 --> 00:08:24,639
- What do you mean, it's not your cab?
- I'm filling in. I'm off...

109
00:08:24,674 --> 00:08:26,975
- We're not getting out of this cab.
- Why aren't we moving?

110
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:29,945
Sorry?

111
00:08:33,249 --> 00:08:35,083
What's up there, Captain Bubba?

112
00:08:35,118 --> 00:08:37,018
I'm off-duty, but these
guys won't get out.

113
00:08:37,053 --> 00:08:38,053
So turn on your light.

114
00:08:38,087 --> 00:08:39,554
I know, there's a problem with it.

115
00:08:40,523 --> 00:08:41,723
Back up.

116
00:08:44,727 --> 00:08:46,795
All right, gents, subway time.

117
00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:47,863
What?

118
00:08:47,897 --> 00:08:51,466
Either subway time, or
overtime. I could use the money.

119
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:53,902
- Let's go.
- What? Where are we going?

120
00:08:53,936 --> 00:08:55,470
Thank you.

121
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:56,872
Fuck you!

122
00:08:59,442 --> 00:09:00,575
Uh, officer,

123
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,177
do you know where
Stanton Street is, please?

124
00:09:02,211 --> 00:09:05,046
You're driving a cab downtown and you
don't know where Stanton Street is?

125
00:09:05,081 --> 00:09:06,648
It's my first week.

126
00:09:06,682 --> 00:09:09,050
Down Second, Houston going east,

127
00:09:09,085 --> 00:09:10,285
make a right wherever you can.

128
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:11,720
All right. Thank you.

129
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:21,196
Yo, guys, I'm off-duty!

130
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,265
What?

131
00:09:27,737 --> 00:09:30,305
Um, I'm supposed to be off-duty.

132
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:33,708
You are? Your light isn't on.

133
00:09:33,743 --> 00:09:36,711
Yeah, I know, it's, uh...

134
00:09:36,746 --> 00:09:39,414
See, I don't know where the light is

135
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:41,216
'cause it's not my cab.

136
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,852
Are you gonna make me get out?

137
00:09:47,657 --> 00:09:49,524
Where do you wanna go?

138
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:52,194
What do you mean?

139
00:09:52,228 --> 00:09:56,364
Well, you got in my cab, so, like,
where do you want me to take you?

140
00:09:57,834 --> 00:09:59,734
The beach.

141
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:01,203
The beach?

142
00:10:01,237 --> 00:10:02,671
Yeah, the beach.

143
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,740
Um...

144
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:08,610
we're in Manhattan, so...

145
00:10:08,644 --> 00:10:10,479
uh, I could do a river?

146
00:10:10,513 --> 00:10:12,447
A river would be fine.

147
00:10:12,482 --> 00:10:14,850
Not down here, though. Go uptown.

148
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,221
Okay.

149
00:10:27,997 --> 00:10:29,831
I really would like to get going.

150
00:10:29,866 --> 00:10:30,765
Yeah.

151
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,167
Sorry.

152
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:49,684
Um, how far?

153
00:10:49,719 --> 00:10:51,953
What?

154
00:10:51,988 --> 00:10:53,989
How far uptown?

155
00:10:56,092 --> 00:10:57,659
Far.

156
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,781
I'm thirsty.

157
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,914
These two, please.

158
00:11:58,588 --> 00:12:01,022
And, uh, let me use the
restroom real quick, please?

159
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,826
Thanks.

160
00:12:15,805 --> 00:12:18,440
You wanna be my next passenger?

161
00:12:25,915 --> 00:12:27,349
All right, thanks, man.

162
00:12:27,383 --> 00:12:30,151
Uh, you can keep that. Thanks.

163
00:13:03,185 --> 00:13:04,619
What's up with him?

164
00:13:06,422 --> 00:13:08,056
Who cares?

165
00:13:35,551 --> 00:13:38,019
So, whose is it?

166
00:13:38,054 --> 00:13:39,387
What?

167
00:13:39,422 --> 00:13:40,588
The cab.

168
00:13:40,623 --> 00:13:42,424
You said it wasn't yours when I got in.

169
00:13:44,293 --> 00:13:46,795
I didn't think you heard anything I said.

170
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:49,698
I don't miss much.

171
00:13:49,732 --> 00:13:51,900
Uh, it's my dad's.

172
00:13:53,536 --> 00:13:55,603
Actually, it's like, one-third my dad's.

173
00:13:55,638 --> 00:13:57,839
He owns it with, like, two other guys.

174
00:13:57,873 --> 00:14:00,909
And you just use it whenever?

175
00:14:00,943 --> 00:14:03,044
Yeah.

176
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:04,679
Actually, no.

177
00:14:04,714 --> 00:14:06,314
Just tonight.

178
00:14:06,348 --> 00:14:09,417
Why tonight?

179
00:14:09,452 --> 00:14:13,021
There's, like, this party
I didn't want to miss.

180
00:14:13,055 --> 00:14:15,590
Was.

181
00:14:15,624 --> 00:14:17,258
- Is.
- Now.

182
00:14:17,293 --> 00:14:18,226
Yeah.

183
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,661
So, you're missing it.

184
00:14:19,695 --> 00:14:20,962
Yeah.

185
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:24,532
Because of me.

186
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,331
So, you close to him?

187
00:14:56,365 --> 00:14:57,732
Who, my dad?

188
00:14:59,034 --> 00:15:00,835
Yeah. Pretty much.

189
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,936
He's a good dad?

190
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:04,405
Yeah.

191
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,174
Yeah, yours?

192
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,809
He was okay.

193
00:15:07,843 --> 00:15:10,011
Oh, I'm sorry.

194
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:16,050
Friday night. Full moon. The river.

195
00:15:16,085 --> 00:15:18,520
This is pretty wonderful.

196
00:15:18,554 --> 00:15:20,455
Yeah, I feel pretty good.

197
00:15:20,489 --> 00:15:22,924
You don't always?

198
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,627
No, it's just...

199
00:15:25,661 --> 00:15:27,896
Like, a lot of time you
just do what you gotta do,

200
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:32,200
or you do what everybody
wants you to do, but...

201
00:15:32,234 --> 00:15:33,401
You know?

202
00:15:33,435 --> 00:15:36,437
I don't, actually.

203
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,179
Tonight was different. Feels different.

204
00:15:44,213 --> 00:15:47,182
And you have no idea why.

205
00:15:47,216 --> 00:15:49,017
Heh.

206
00:15:56,025 --> 00:15:57,625
Open your hand.

207
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:07,135
Uh, no, it's okay.

208
00:16:24,453 --> 00:16:27,956
Do you ever wish you could
just transport yourself?

209
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:32,660
Something bad happens here,
and suddenly you're over there?

210
00:16:40,502 --> 00:16:43,037
I can't be alone tonight.

211
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,404
You okay?

212
00:17:49,438 --> 00:17:50,738
Yeah.

213
00:17:51,907 --> 00:17:52,974
Yeah.

214
00:18:09,124 --> 00:18:10,158
Huh?

215
00:18:12,995 --> 00:18:14,395
This is nice.

216
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,698
Yeah, it's okay.

217
00:18:16,732 --> 00:18:18,499
It's more than okay, this is nice.

218
00:18:18,534 --> 00:18:20,101
Okay.

219
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,971
I'm just saying.

220
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,042
Ah, look, Mustafa left his bombs
home, 'bout to get him some.

221
00:18:29,511 --> 00:18:30,979
What?

222
00:18:33,515 --> 00:18:34,515
What?

223
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,551
What did you say?

224
00:18:37,586 --> 00:18:39,520
- Me?
- Yeah.

225
00:18:40,689 --> 00:18:44,092
I said, did you leave your
bombs at home, Mustafa?

226
00:18:44,126 --> 00:18:45,293
Give it a rest, okay?

227
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:48,796
What, I was just talking to
him, I wasn't talking to you.

228
00:18:48,831 --> 00:18:52,200
What happened? You saw
Homeland Security or something?

229
00:18:56,105 --> 00:18:57,305
Funny guy.

230
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:58,339
Come on.

231
00:18:58,374 --> 00:18:59,407
Anyway, look,

232
00:18:59,441 --> 00:19:01,175
I'm going to Shiranda's, man.

233
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,977
I know that her cousin is there,

234
00:19:03,012 --> 00:19:04,879
And, uh, she got that fat ass.

235
00:19:04,913 --> 00:19:06,514
I know they got some weed over there, too.

236
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:25,767
This is your place?

237
00:19:25,801 --> 00:19:27,869
Yeah.

238
00:19:34,476 --> 00:19:35,576
Uh-oh.

239
00:19:35,611 --> 00:19:36,744
What?

240
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:47,555
No, it's fine.

241
00:19:50,459 --> 00:19:52,193
Actually, I'll just...

242
00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:54,962
It's fine now.

243
00:19:56,598 --> 00:20:01,035
Just cats... or dogs.

244
00:20:17,453 --> 00:20:19,220
Can I ask you something?

245
00:20:21,857 --> 00:20:23,191
What's your name?

246
00:20:23,225 --> 00:20:25,793
- I didn't tell you?
- No.

247
00:20:29,698 --> 00:20:31,766
You don't want to know mine?

248
00:20:33,469 --> 00:20:35,169
Does that happen to you a lot?

249
00:20:35,204 --> 00:20:37,205
What?

250
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:39,140
Those guys out there.

251
00:20:40,943 --> 00:20:42,376
Now and then.

252
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,858
Oh...

253
00:20:59,194 --> 00:21:01,662
Do you have a girlfriend?

254
00:21:01,697 --> 00:21:05,133
No. Do you?

255
00:21:07,436 --> 00:21:09,003
Would that turn you on?

256
00:21:17,946 --> 00:21:20,047
Watch this.

257
00:21:23,585 --> 00:21:25,153
Whoa.

258
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,525
Wow.

259
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,893
Now you.

260
00:21:31,927 --> 00:21:34,896
What? No.

261
00:21:37,633 --> 00:21:39,433
No, not even with that. I don't...

262
00:21:39,468 --> 00:21:41,469
Oh, come on, look, I did it.

263
00:21:41,503 --> 00:21:43,371
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

264
00:21:43,405 --> 00:21:45,573
- No. No way.
- Yes.

265
00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:49,076
Don't you do what everyone tells you to do?

266
00:21:51,213 --> 00:21:52,747
Isn't that what you said?

267
00:22:11,366 --> 00:22:12,500
Oh...

268
00:22:12,534 --> 00:22:14,802
- You did it.
- Whoa.

269
00:22:14,836 --> 00:22:16,170
Whoa.

270
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:19,840
Am I really here?

271
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:30,351
What is that?

272
00:22:32,287 --> 00:22:34,288
This is the party you missed.

273
00:23:08,423 --> 00:23:10,157
Now...

274
00:23:12,494 --> 00:23:13,561
What?

275
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:20,601
That, I won't do.

276
00:23:20,636 --> 00:23:22,169
- Yes.
- That, I will not do.

277
00:23:22,204 --> 00:23:23,371
Yes.

278
00:23:23,405 --> 00:23:25,172
I can't.

279
00:23:27,342 --> 00:23:28,976
- No.
- Yes.

280
00:23:33,615 --> 00:23:34,949
Yes.

281
00:23:54,903 --> 00:23:56,771
Oh, sh...

282
00:26:55,116 --> 00:26:59,119
Hey, I think it's pretty late, so...

283
00:26:59,154 --> 00:27:00,521
I should probably get going.

284
00:27:00,555 --> 00:27:02,857
I gotta get home, so...

285
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:19,974
Hey.

286
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,894
Fuck!

287
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:33,781
Aah!

288
00:29:46,888 --> 00:29:48,355
Oh...

289
00:31:10,305 --> 00:31:11,772
Roll your window down.

290
00:31:11,806 --> 00:31:12,740
Huh?

291
00:31:12,774 --> 00:31:15,709
Roll the window down.

292
00:31:15,744 --> 00:31:17,377
Roll it down.

293
00:31:20,014 --> 00:31:23,183
So, let me ask you, in your own
words, what does "no left turn" mean?

294
00:31:24,986 --> 00:31:26,220
Uh...

295
00:31:26,254 --> 00:31:27,755
I must have missed the sign, I...

296
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:29,623
License, registration, and insurance.

297
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,597
Come on.

298
00:31:36,631 --> 00:31:37,698
Give it to him.

299
00:31:37,732 --> 00:31:38,899
Over here.

300
00:31:44,305 --> 00:31:45,906
How much did you drink tonight?

301
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,874
Huh?

302
00:31:46,908 --> 00:31:47,908
I don't drink.

303
00:31:47,942 --> 00:31:49,143
- No?
- Nothing, I don't drink.

304
00:31:49,177 --> 00:31:52,079
No? 'Cause I'm getting high
just conversating with you.

305
00:31:52,113 --> 00:31:53,680
Step out of the car.

306
00:31:56,651 --> 00:31:57,918
Out.

307
00:32:00,488 --> 00:32:01,755
And I got a song request.

308
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:05,292
How 'bout you play me, maybe,
two bars of "Little Brown Jug."

309
00:32:07,262 --> 00:32:08,729
Do I have to?

310
00:32:08,763 --> 00:32:10,264
No, see that right there, that's a mistake.

311
00:32:10,298 --> 00:32:13,700
I'm gonna explain this to you since
I can see you're a little confused.

312
00:32:13,735 --> 00:32:15,702
- Yes, you may politely refuse...
- I can't...

313
00:32:15,737 --> 00:32:16,904
I'm not done.

314
00:32:16,938 --> 00:32:18,705
You refuse, it's a separate offense,

315
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,841
which is an automatic
arrest. Is that what you want?

316
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:22,676
- No.
- Hey, Cass.

317
00:32:25,613 --> 00:32:27,347
Put your hands on the car.

318
00:32:32,987 --> 00:32:35,489
Listen, nothing comes up on this guy.

319
00:32:35,523 --> 00:32:37,624
So why don't we just make
this reckless driving?

320
00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:39,126
- It's a lot less paperwork.
- Ugh.

321
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,727
Come on, it's late.

322
00:32:40,762 --> 00:32:43,564
I don't want to do reckless driving.
I feel like he's done more than that.

323
00:32:43,598 --> 00:32:45,165
Come on. He's like a kid.

324
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,434
Kids do stuff...

325
00:32:47,468 --> 00:32:49,369
65th and Central Park West.

326
00:32:49,404 --> 00:32:52,472
- Copy.
- Come on, what do you say?

327
00:32:52,507 --> 00:32:53,707
Yeah, copy?

328
00:32:53,741 --> 00:32:56,176
Please respond, 1031 at...

329
00:32:56,211 --> 00:32:57,644
You know what tonight is?

330
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,980
- Huh?
- It's your lucky night.

331
00:33:00,014 --> 00:33:01,415
I can go?

332
00:33:01,449 --> 00:33:03,984
Did I say that?

333
00:33:04,018 --> 00:33:06,119
Break-in on 87th, we gotta go.

334
00:33:06,154 --> 00:33:08,589
What about Cheech and Chong, here,
what are we gonna do with him?

335
00:33:08,623 --> 00:33:10,490
I don't know. Cut him loose?

336
00:33:11,993 --> 00:33:13,560
Bring him with us?

337
00:33:13,595 --> 00:33:14,461
I can't.

338
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:17,030
Is... Excuse me, is
somebody talking to you?

339
00:33:17,065 --> 00:33:18,265
- What...
- Shut up.

340
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:20,767
I can't leave my father's cab here.

341
00:33:20,802 --> 00:33:22,135
What are you talking about?

342
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,938
It's my dad's cab. I can't just
leave it. He needs it for work.

343
00:33:27,308 --> 00:33:30,711
Well, call him to come get
it. Else it's gonna get towed.

344
00:33:30,745 --> 00:33:31,845
- Let's go, in the back.
- Come on, let's go.

345
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,181
- There's no car for him to come get the car.
- In the back.

346
00:33:34,215 --> 00:33:36,984
That's fine, that's fine. You'll
call him from the precinct.

347
00:33:37,018 --> 00:33:38,552
Hey, cuffs?

348
00:33:38,586 --> 00:33:40,153
No, I don't think so.

349
00:33:40,188 --> 00:33:41,822
He needs it for work,

350
00:33:41,856 --> 00:33:44,758
- and there's no way...
- Yeah, I know. You call him, when you get to the precinct,

351
00:33:44,792 --> 00:33:46,927
you tell him where it is, and
he'll come and get it. Let's go.

352
00:33:46,961 --> 00:33:48,729
Watch your head. There you go. Inside.

353
00:33:57,672 --> 00:33:59,339
What street is this?

354
00:34:20,161 --> 00:34:21,962
- You the gentleman that called?
- Yeah.

355
00:34:21,996 --> 00:34:23,463
Okay, so what's going on?

356
00:34:23,498 --> 00:34:25,532
So, I hear something, you know?

357
00:34:25,566 --> 00:34:26,934
A glass breaking.

358
00:34:26,968 --> 00:34:30,370
And then from my window,
I see an open door.

359
00:34:30,405 --> 00:34:32,906
I see this man go through the door,

360
00:34:32,941 --> 00:34:35,909
and then he comes back
out a few seconds later.

361
00:34:35,944 --> 00:34:38,612
Then I see him running down the street

362
00:34:38,646 --> 00:34:40,314
and get into a cab.

363
00:34:40,348 --> 00:34:42,015
Race?

364
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,318
Could have been light-skinned black,

365
00:34:44,385 --> 00:34:46,386
uh, Latino, I really don't know.

366
00:34:46,421 --> 00:34:47,988
Not Caucasian, though?

367
00:34:48,022 --> 00:34:49,289
Could have been, sure, why not?

368
00:34:55,897 --> 00:34:57,097
Clothes?

369
00:34:57,131 --> 00:34:59,166
He wore clothes.

370
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,201
I'm sorry. Uh, dark, maybe.

371
00:35:01,235 --> 00:35:02,936
Okay, maybe, and he took a cab.

372
00:35:02,971 --> 00:35:04,304
Yeah, a cab.

373
00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:07,174
Okay, sir, can you just wait
right here for us, please?

374
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:08,475
- Here? Yeah.
- Uh-huh. Thank you.

375
00:35:08,509 --> 00:35:10,010
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

376
00:35:33,668 --> 00:35:35,569
- What do you got?
- We got a break-in.

377
00:35:35,603 --> 00:35:37,270
One eyewit, this gentleman here.

378
00:35:37,305 --> 00:35:39,239
Sees male, undetermined race,

379
00:35:39,273 --> 00:35:41,508
goes in, comes out, runs down the street,

380
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:42,909
gets into a cab.

381
00:35:42,944 --> 00:35:44,244
Anyone inside?

382
00:35:44,278 --> 00:35:45,545
Waiting on you.

383
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,680
Who's that in the car?

384
00:35:46,714 --> 00:35:49,916
No one. He was with us
when we got the call.

385
00:35:49,951 --> 00:35:53,320
He's not drunk, I can see that. He's
just driving like a fucking idiot.

386
00:35:53,354 --> 00:35:54,921
Fine. Let's go.

387
00:35:59,994 --> 00:36:02,996
Uh, sir, we're off-shift
like, two hours ago.

388
00:36:03,031 --> 00:36:04,698
Can you just take him in?

389
00:36:04,732 --> 00:36:06,833
Let's go inside.

390
00:36:06,868 --> 00:36:08,235
Flashlight.

391
00:36:10,638 --> 00:36:12,305
Hello?

392
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:15,275
NYPD! Anybody home?

393
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:26,686
Hello?

394
00:36:57,185 --> 00:36:59,619
Excuse me sir, take a step back.

395
00:36:59,654 --> 00:37:00,821
Sorry.

396
00:37:16,671 --> 00:37:19,239
Hey, Teddy? Yeah, it's Jerry.

397
00:37:19,273 --> 00:37:22,175
I'm at this break-in on 87th.

398
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:24,177
Gonna need additional units.

399
00:37:24,212 --> 00:37:26,346
EMTs, Night Watch,

400
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,148
CSU, and an ME.

401
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,617
Are you puking?

402
00:37:30,651 --> 00:37:31,985
Tell me you're not puking.

403
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:34,054
I'm gagging, I'm not puking.

404
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:36,857
For fuck's sake, you gonna do that,
you can do it in the trunk of your car.

405
00:37:36,891 --> 00:37:38,492
This is a nice neighborhood.

406
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:40,360
Is this guy still here?

407
00:37:40,394 --> 00:37:42,129
We're still here, where is he gonna go?

408
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:48,702
Now I'm always respectful of the
fact that this is a great predator

409
00:37:50,371 --> 00:37:53,073
and certainly, if it wanted to,
could take me out very easily.

410
00:37:53,107 --> 00:37:54,374
Night Watch.

411
00:37:54,408 --> 00:37:56,409
Yeah, hey, it's Sergeant Klein at the 2-1.

412
00:37:56,444 --> 00:38:01,281
We got a suspicious DOA
at 144 West 87th Street.

413
00:38:01,315 --> 00:38:04,217
Inside or out?

414
00:38:04,252 --> 00:38:05,852
What's suspicious about it?

415
00:38:05,887 --> 00:38:08,288
What's suspicious about it?

416
00:38:11,259 --> 00:38:13,426
Knife wounds.

417
00:38:13,461 --> 00:38:16,029
Stomach...

418
00:38:16,063 --> 00:38:17,731
Chest...

419
00:38:17,765 --> 00:38:20,333
Hands...

420
00:38:20,368 --> 00:38:22,736
Fatal...

421
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:27,674
So, there's no way this could
wait for the day tour, huh?

422
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:30,010
Unresponsive.

423
00:38:30,044 --> 00:38:31,978
Yeah, no vitals at the time of arrival.

424
00:38:32,013 --> 00:38:34,047
That was like, 10 minutes ago.

425
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:35,815
Let's say, 0220?

426
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:38,351
All right.

427
00:38:43,791 --> 00:38:45,325
- Who's here?
- What do you mean?

428
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,826
I mean who's here?

429
00:38:46,861 --> 00:38:47,694
You.

430
00:38:47,728 --> 00:38:49,429
Everybody else is up at Harlem Hospital.

431
00:38:49,463 --> 00:38:50,664
Those Agg-Assaults.

432
00:38:50,698 --> 00:38:52,799
Are Paul Mason and Shiyanov there?

433
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:56,336
And don't give me any shit about
"life is cheap above 96th Street."

434
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:57,571
We're cool.

435
00:39:01,475 --> 00:39:03,410
You know what?

436
00:39:03,444 --> 00:39:06,046
I'll call him.

437
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,281
- Box?
- Yeah.

438
00:39:10,084 --> 00:39:11,918
I was gonna say.

439
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,534
Box.

440
00:39:27,568 --> 00:39:30,437
Dennis. Danny Lang, Night Watch.

441
00:39:30,471 --> 00:39:31,605
Sorry to wake you.

442
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:33,907
Just thought you might want to
get in on this from the jump.

443
00:39:33,941 --> 00:39:35,141
What do you got?

444
00:39:35,176 --> 00:39:37,877
Stabbing. Female, early 20s.

445
00:39:37,912 --> 00:39:41,715
144 West 87th Street. Inside.

446
00:39:41,749 --> 00:39:42,816
Brownstone?

447
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:45,986
Yeah. It's gonna get
pretty photogenic out there.

448
00:39:50,825 --> 00:39:53,221
_

449
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,289
- Where do you think you're going?
- Detective Box, son.

450
00:40:22,323 --> 00:40:23,723
Sorry, boss.

451
00:40:25,493 --> 00:40:28,328
Get the door before 10
more people trample through.

452
00:40:39,373 --> 00:40:40,740
Who made the call?

453
00:40:40,775 --> 00:40:42,976
Neighbor over there.

454
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,578
Anybody else see anything?

455
00:40:45,613 --> 00:40:47,347
- Apparently not.
- Cameras?

456
00:40:47,381 --> 00:40:49,783
There's one up the street.
We're not sure if it's working.

457
00:40:49,817 --> 00:40:51,651
Pulling the film.

458
00:40:51,686 --> 00:40:53,053
Who's that?

459
00:40:53,087 --> 00:40:55,355
- He's ours.
- Reckless driving.

460
00:40:55,389 --> 00:40:57,557
You picked him up and brought
him here? What the fuck for?

461
00:40:57,591 --> 00:40:59,459
Well, we just pulled him
over when the call comes in...

462
00:40:59,493 --> 00:41:00,660
Well, I don't want him here.

463
00:41:00,695 --> 00:41:02,796
Get a unit. Take him back to
the house or cut him loose.

464
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:06,066
- Uh, we'll take him, sir. We're off-duty...
- Not you. You stay.

465
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,801
Let's get the neighbor
back to the house, too.

466
00:41:07,835 --> 00:41:09,502
He's famous enough out here already.

467
00:41:09,537 --> 00:41:11,905
No smoking on my crime scene.

468
00:41:11,939 --> 00:41:13,306
Go ahead, sir.

469
00:41:17,244 --> 00:41:18,712
All right, let's go.

470
00:41:18,746 --> 00:41:20,814
Where?

471
00:41:20,848 --> 00:41:22,682
Just get out of the car.

472
00:41:44,238 --> 00:41:46,539
Box wants you to take him to the station.

473
00:42:01,489 --> 00:42:03,423
Nice-looking kid.

474
00:42:04,592 --> 00:42:05,625
Yeah.

475
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,635
What'd he do?

476
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:17,570
- Who?
- Him.

477
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:21,074
I don't know, he's a witness, isn't he?

478
00:42:23,411 --> 00:42:26,846
Hey, what'd you see?

479
00:42:26,881 --> 00:42:29,849
I didn't see nothing.

480
00:42:29,884 --> 00:42:32,552
Some witness he gon' make.

481
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,627
Is she dead?

482
00:42:40,661 --> 00:42:43,096
I think that's safe to say.

483
00:43:06,053 --> 00:43:07,720
- Cop a squat.
- What?

484
00:43:07,755 --> 00:43:09,088
Sit down.

485
00:43:09,123 --> 00:43:12,258
Hey, did Maldonado
really puke at the scene?

486
00:43:12,293 --> 00:43:14,461
Must have been bad clams.

487
00:43:14,495 --> 00:43:16,262
Were there still a lot of guys there?

488
00:43:16,297 --> 00:43:19,132
I mean, that's a mess.

489
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:20,400
Just stay still.

490
00:43:20,434 --> 00:43:21,968
West 87th Street.

491
00:43:22,002 --> 00:43:23,169
I mean, it's quiet.

492
00:43:23,204 --> 00:43:26,206
Yeah. All right.

493
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,075
Yeah, Maldonado had us pick up this kid.

494
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:30,643
Cup of coffee, man?

495
00:43:36,754 --> 00:43:39,644
_

496
00:43:41,055 --> 00:43:42,689
Knock, knock.

497
00:43:42,723 --> 00:43:44,791
- Hey.
- Watch where you step.

498
00:44:05,613 --> 00:44:07,847
Klein.

499
00:44:07,882 --> 00:44:10,583
Well, I was doing all right.
Then I answered the phone.

500
00:44:13,854 --> 00:44:15,588
How much you give me to check?

501
00:44:28,235 --> 00:44:31,037
I got a Pauline Rodriguez, will that do?

502
00:44:38,479 --> 00:44:39,846
Always a pleasure.

503
00:44:48,122 --> 00:44:50,823
Tom, hey, weekend or ED?

504
00:44:50,858 --> 00:44:52,425
Dustin. Blast from the past.

505
00:44:52,459 --> 00:44:54,928
Dust? Where the hell am
I supposed to park him?

506
00:44:54,962 --> 00:44:57,297
Take his ass to St. Luke's, please.

507
00:44:57,331 --> 00:44:58,498
Let's get him up.

508
00:44:58,532 --> 00:45:00,533
Up. Up.

509
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:35,001
Fuck you lookin' at?

510
00:45:43,978 --> 00:45:46,379
What can you tell me
about the weapon, Harry?

511
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:48,414
Pretty sure it's one knife.

512
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:51,050
Approximately one and a half inch wide by,

513
00:45:51,085 --> 00:45:52,518
I'm gonna say,

514
00:45:52,553 --> 00:45:53,653
five inches long.

515
00:45:53,687 --> 00:45:55,421
Till I get her on the table and probe.

516
00:45:55,456 --> 00:45:56,756
Serrated, or no?

517
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:59,025
Not sure yet. Possibly.

518
00:46:09,269 --> 00:46:10,603
What happened?

519
00:46:11,739 --> 00:46:13,373
What, you can't tell me nothing?

520
00:46:13,407 --> 00:46:15,008
Or you don't know nothing?

521
00:46:17,511 --> 00:46:21,014
Ain't that... That's where
that girl lives, right?

522
00:46:21,081 --> 00:46:23,783
I mean, what happened? What'd he
do? What, he kill her or something?

523
00:46:25,586 --> 00:46:27,487
I'm just playing, I'm just playing.

524
00:46:27,521 --> 00:46:29,489
But for real, what happened?

525
00:46:30,724 --> 00:46:33,359
You can't give out any information?

526
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:17,403
Have a seat, sir.

527
00:47:17,438 --> 00:47:19,505
Someone will be right with you, all right?

528
00:47:20,407 --> 00:47:21,841
Hi, Sergeant.

529
00:47:21,875 --> 00:47:22,975
Hey, who's this?

530
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,043
One wit.

531
00:47:24,078 --> 00:47:26,546
Sergeant told me to bring him in.

532
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:31,617
All right, looks good. Any problems?

533
00:47:31,652 --> 00:47:33,086
Nope.

534
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,074
Dad.

535
00:47:59,413 --> 00:48:01,180
You all right?

536
00:48:01,215 --> 00:48:03,316
Where's Naz?

537
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:05,284
What?

538
00:48:06,587 --> 00:48:10,189
So, who's "he" in the sentence
"he kill her or something"?

539
00:48:10,224 --> 00:48:12,692
Uh, look, man, I was just saying.

540
00:48:12,726 --> 00:48:14,193
You were just saying what?

541
00:48:14,228 --> 00:48:18,131
I mean, you know, some
Arab dude she was with.

542
00:48:18,198 --> 00:48:20,233
Describe him.

543
00:48:20,267 --> 00:48:21,601
You know, an Arab dude.

544
00:48:21,635 --> 00:48:23,035
No, I don't.

545
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:25,505
Look like he work at a deli or some shit.

546
00:48:25,539 --> 00:48:27,740
Try harder.

547
00:48:27,775 --> 00:48:31,511
Uh, like, little, short, skinny,

548
00:48:31,545 --> 00:48:33,579
Puerto Rican-looking
motherfucker with beanie eyes.

549
00:48:33,614 --> 00:48:36,849
How do you know he wasn't Puerto
Rican? Was he wearing anything Arabic?

550
00:48:36,884 --> 00:48:38,718
Nah, man, he...

551
00:48:38,752 --> 00:48:40,253
He had on his regular, you know,

552
00:48:40,287 --> 00:48:42,054
Friday night, go out and party shit.

553
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:43,589
I mean, I tried to warn her, too.

554
00:48:43,624 --> 00:48:45,625
Yeah? How'd you go about doing that?

555
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:48,027
I just told him right to his face.

556
00:48:48,061 --> 00:48:49,529
But you didn't know him.

557
00:48:49,563 --> 00:48:50,930
Nope.

558
00:48:50,964 --> 00:48:52,832
Never saw him before.

559
00:48:52,866 --> 00:48:54,267
Nope, nope.

560
00:48:54,301 --> 00:48:55,802
You know the girl?

561
00:48:55,836 --> 00:48:58,571
I mean, not <i>per se,</i>
you know what I'm saying?

562
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:00,339
No, I don't.

563
00:49:00,374 --> 00:49:01,974
I mean, I know her type.

564
00:49:02,009 --> 00:49:03,509
What type is that?

565
00:49:05,112 --> 00:49:07,747
You know what, this coming out wrong.

566
00:49:07,781 --> 00:49:09,448
What's your name?

567
00:49:09,483 --> 00:49:11,617
How about you give me
your card or something,

568
00:49:11,652 --> 00:49:13,119
and then I just bang you on this later?

569
00:49:13,153 --> 00:49:14,921
My card.

570
00:49:14,955 --> 00:49:19,292
If I turn you upside down, how
much weed is gonna fall out?

571
00:49:20,761 --> 00:49:22,528
Oh, so that's how you do?

572
00:49:27,067 --> 00:49:28,835
See?

573
00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:30,937
No good deed goes unturned.

574
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:32,471
Take him in.

575
00:49:33,707 --> 00:49:34,841
Let's go.

576
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:38,911
Fuck LeBron. He can shit MVPs
out his ass year in, year out.

577
00:49:38,946 --> 00:49:41,180
He's still not gonna be able
to deliver rings like Kobe.

578
00:49:41,215 --> 00:49:43,082
Nah, nigga. Kobe ain't got no heart.

579
00:49:43,116 --> 00:49:44,584
Kobe ain't got no team, man.

580
00:49:44,618 --> 00:49:46,853
- Kobe is the team!
- That's the problem.

581
00:49:46,887 --> 00:49:48,654
81 points in one game, didn't he score?

582
00:49:48,689 --> 00:49:49,822
- He a overachiever.
- That's some...

583
00:49:49,857 --> 00:49:51,991
You got a fucking problem
you ain't passing the ball.

584
00:49:52,025 --> 00:49:53,025
Nigga was triple-teamed.

585
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,794
- Look, why would he want to...
- Triple-teamed and...

586
00:49:54,828 --> 00:49:56,696
Why would he pass the ball if he...

587
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:59,332
I roll with winners, homeboy.
I don't know about you.

588
00:49:59,366 --> 00:50:01,367
No, man, he good, he good. He great.

589
00:50:01,401 --> 00:50:02,869
Yeah, yeah, thank you.

590
00:50:02,903 --> 00:50:05,104
But LeBron James... LeBron James,

591
00:50:05,138 --> 00:50:08,007
look, he got a good two
inches on Kobe heightwise,

592
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:09,709
and like three...

593
00:50:09,743 --> 00:50:11,444
- You know... 30 pounds.
- How long was LeBron...

594
00:50:11,478 --> 00:50:13,846
- How long was LeBron with them boys in Cleveland?
- Come on.

595
00:50:13,881 --> 00:50:15,214
What, like six years.

596
00:50:15,249 --> 00:50:18,551
What did he win for them?
What did he win for them?

597
00:50:31,064 --> 00:50:32,598
Who the hell is this?

598
00:50:32,633 --> 00:50:34,934
This is Nasir's father, Amir.

599
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:37,570
Mr. Khan?

600
00:50:37,604 --> 00:50:38,971
Is he with you?

601
00:50:39,006 --> 00:50:40,172
No, sir.

602
00:50:40,207 --> 00:50:41,607
Do you know where he is?

603
00:50:41,642 --> 00:50:43,442
No. I haven't seen him.

604
00:50:43,477 --> 00:50:47,146
No, but he said you were
going out together tonight.

605
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:51,350
Yeah, we were supposed to go
to a party, but I didn't go.

606
00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:52,952
So, where was this party?

607
00:50:54,621 --> 00:50:58,224
I have no idea. I don't
have the address on me.

608
00:51:28,722 --> 00:51:31,257
I don't know what you're doing here.

609
00:51:31,291 --> 00:51:34,160
I have witnesses to interview, do you?

610
00:51:34,194 --> 00:51:35,094
Go back out there.

611
00:51:35,128 --> 00:51:37,596
Sarge, we got 10,000
gold shields on the scene.

612
00:51:37,631 --> 00:51:40,066
- What do you need us out there for?
- It's called chain of custody.

613
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,468
Didn't you go to the
academy like the other kids?

614
00:51:42,502 --> 00:51:44,603
And when you log it all, remember,

615
00:51:44,638 --> 00:51:46,439
blood stays with blood, hair with hair,

616
00:51:46,473 --> 00:51:48,975
photos with photos.

617
00:51:49,009 --> 00:51:50,609
Can I ask you guys something?

618
00:51:50,644 --> 00:51:53,779
Who's my friend over there who's been
staring at me like Bambi last two hours?

619
00:51:53,814 --> 00:51:56,215
Ah, shit, he's ours.

620
00:51:56,249 --> 00:51:57,850
You, sir.

621
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:01,654
What is he, DWI? What'd he blow?

622
00:52:01,688 --> 00:52:03,456
He was supposed to get tested in the house.

623
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:04,790
He didn't... I mean, you didn't?

624
00:52:04,825 --> 00:52:05,958
What, get the memo?

625
00:52:05,993 --> 00:52:08,194
- Who'd we tell to test?
- We told what's-his-name.

626
00:52:08,228 --> 00:52:09,295
What's-his-name.

627
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:10,763
What's the matter, you
guys don't like overtime?

628
00:52:10,797 --> 00:52:13,399
- Who doesn't like overtime?
- You want, I'll test him right now.

629
00:52:13,433 --> 00:52:14,400
Now you're gonna test him.

630
00:52:14,434 --> 00:52:16,569
Test what? It's gone, if it was ever there.

631
00:52:16,603 --> 00:52:18,037
Just dodged a bullet here, kid.

632
00:52:18,071 --> 00:52:20,940
Get his pedigree, search him, clear
him of warrants, and kick him free.

633
00:52:20,974 --> 00:52:22,842
Put your hands on the railing for me.

634
00:52:22,876 --> 00:52:25,578
Be careful with the inventory vouchers.

635
00:52:25,612 --> 00:52:28,781
DCPI called, I'm like,
totally in the dark here.

636
00:52:28,815 --> 00:52:31,150
- Can you help me out?
- I'll do my best, Teddy.

637
00:52:31,184 --> 00:52:32,518
Uh, name?

638
00:52:32,552 --> 00:52:34,086
Nasir Khan.

639
00:52:34,121 --> 00:52:35,988
Victim's name is Andrea Cornish.

640
00:52:36,023 --> 00:52:37,356
Spell it.

641
00:52:37,391 --> 00:52:38,824
22 years old.

642
00:52:38,859 --> 00:52:40,426
N-a-s-i-r.

643
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,461
- K-h-a-n.
- Caucasian.

644
00:52:42,496 --> 00:52:43,929
Found in a bedroom,

645
00:52:43,964 --> 00:52:45,464
in bed.

646
00:52:45,499 --> 00:52:47,666
- DOB?
- Stabbing homicide.

647
00:52:47,701 --> 00:52:50,603
- Um, 11/12/90.
- Suspect is a male.

648
00:52:50,637 --> 00:52:53,105
Unknown age, unknown race.

649
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,607
This your current address?

650
00:52:54,641 --> 00:52:56,542
- Yeah.
- Seen leaving at approximately 0200

651
00:52:56,576 --> 00:52:59,111
running down the block hailing a taxi.

652
00:52:59,146 --> 00:53:01,313
I didn't say that he hailed a taxi.

653
00:53:01,348 --> 00:53:03,682
I said that he left in a taxi.

654
00:53:03,717 --> 00:53:04,950
That's what I said.

655
00:53:04,985 --> 00:53:06,786
His taxi.

656
00:53:08,989 --> 00:53:10,056
Fine.

657
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:12,391
Is this what we do?
Dump our witnesses here?

658
00:53:12,426 --> 00:53:14,693
Somebody escort the
gentleman to the squad room.

659
00:53:14,728 --> 00:53:16,429
Uh, Frank, do you mind?

660
00:53:16,463 --> 00:53:18,564
Come with me, sir.

661
00:53:18,598 --> 00:53:20,433
Race, what are you?

662
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:21,734
Uh, Pakistani.

663
00:53:21,768 --> 00:53:23,335
Asian Pacific or other.

664
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:25,671
- Who's the other guy?
- What other guy?

665
00:53:25,705 --> 00:53:27,907
I was talking to who I said bring in.

666
00:53:27,941 --> 00:53:29,075
The one reeking weed.

667
00:53:29,109 --> 00:53:30,843
Who'd we tell?

668
00:53:30,877 --> 00:53:31,844
Bell.

669
00:53:31,878 --> 00:53:33,946
Nope. Brought him in.

670
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:35,548
How many times stabbed?

671
00:53:35,582 --> 00:53:37,149
I didn't count, Teddy.

672
00:53:37,184 --> 00:53:39,151
- A lot.
- Occupation?

673
00:53:39,186 --> 00:53:40,186
Student.

674
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:42,555
- Get it from Harry.
- Where?

675
00:53:42,589 --> 00:53:45,324
Please put your hands behind your
head for me, please, lock your fingers.

676
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:46,926
- Where?
- Hudson College.

677
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,327
Turn around.

678
00:53:51,164 --> 00:53:53,065
Weapon recovered?

679
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,834
Not as yet.

680
00:53:54,868 --> 00:53:57,169
ESU's doing a toss of the house,

681
00:53:57,204 --> 00:53:59,939
street, dumpsters, grates, drains.

682
00:53:59,973 --> 00:54:03,342
What we're looking for is an
approximately five-inch-long,

683
00:54:03,376 --> 00:54:06,312
one-and-a-half-inch-wide,
possibly serrated...

684
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:11,150
knife.

685
00:54:13,453 --> 00:54:14,920
Turn around.

686
00:54:17,157 --> 00:54:18,991
Do not move.

687
00:54:19,025 --> 00:54:20,593
You picked him up where, again?

688
00:54:20,627 --> 00:54:21,961
65th and Broadway.

689
00:54:21,995 --> 00:54:23,963
- No, wait, wait.
- What time?

690
00:54:23,997 --> 00:54:25,197
About 0200.

691
00:54:25,232 --> 00:54:26,265
I didn't do it.

692
00:54:26,299 --> 00:54:27,766
Didn't do what?

693
00:54:29,603 --> 00:54:31,470
What's your name, son?

694
00:54:33,473 --> 00:54:35,841
Nasir. You don't understand.

695
00:54:35,876 --> 00:54:38,277
That's why we're gonna talk, okay?

696
00:54:38,311 --> 00:54:39,512
So I will understand.

697
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:41,480
Just you and me.

698
00:54:41,515 --> 00:54:42,715
Come over here.

699
00:54:42,749 --> 00:54:44,316
- Come on. Come on.
- Please, let go of me.

700
00:54:44,351 --> 00:54:45,818
No, no!

701
00:54:45,852 --> 00:54:47,019
I didn't do anything!

702
00:54:47,053 --> 00:54:49,622
- I didn't do anything!
- Put your hands behind your back!

703
00:54:49,656 --> 00:54:51,090
Give me your arm!

704
00:54:55,395 --> 00:54:57,129
Hey, hey, man,

705
00:54:57,164 --> 00:54:59,598
that's the dude I was talking
about. That's him, right there.

706
00:54:59,633 --> 00:55:01,500
Yeah. Hey, that's him.

707
00:55:01,535 --> 00:55:02,835
Aah!

708
00:55:02,869 --> 00:55:04,236
No!

709
00:55:04,271 --> 00:55:06,438
_

710
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:09,308
Argh! No! No!

711
00:55:09,342 --> 00:55:11,243
I didn't do anything!

712
00:55:15,749 --> 00:55:17,416
Should we call the police?

713
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:18,717
No.

714
00:55:35,869 --> 00:55:38,103
Remember what he said in the car?

715
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,574
"Is she dead?"

716
00:56:07,534 --> 00:56:11,470
We didn't, uh, formally meet out there.

717
00:56:11,504 --> 00:56:14,139
I'm Detective Sergeant Dennis Box.

718
00:56:16,376 --> 00:56:18,444
So, Nasir.

719
00:56:18,478 --> 00:56:20,613
Is that what you like to be called, or?

720
00:56:20,647 --> 00:56:21,580
Naz.

721
00:56:21,615 --> 00:56:25,284
Naz. Okay. That's easy.

722
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:29,555
So, Naz, what happened tonight?

723
00:56:32,192 --> 00:56:34,760
Did you know Andrea well, or just meet her?

724
00:56:37,097 --> 00:56:39,231
Just someone who got in your cab?

725
00:56:41,001 --> 00:56:42,568
My dad's cab.

726
00:56:42,602 --> 00:56:44,570
Your dad's cab, all right.

727
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:48,474
You picked her up in the cab.

728
00:56:49,576 --> 00:56:50,843
Where?

729
00:56:53,813 --> 00:56:55,347
Naz...

730
00:56:56,483 --> 00:56:58,350
I don't know. Downtown somewhere.

731
00:56:58,385 --> 00:56:59,985
I was lost. I don't know.

732
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:03,455
Okay. Then?

733
00:57:05,558 --> 00:57:07,526
Where did she say she wanted to go?

734
00:57:12,399 --> 00:57:14,300
The beach.

735
00:57:14,334 --> 00:57:16,068
The what?

736
00:57:16,102 --> 00:57:18,037
The beach.

737
00:57:18,071 --> 00:57:19,438
The beach?

738
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:25,744
She say something, or...

739
00:57:25,779 --> 00:57:28,881
do something or behave
in some way to upset you?

740
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:31,417
No.

741
00:57:31,451 --> 00:57:32,885
She must have said something.

742
00:57:32,919 --> 00:57:34,553
No.

743
00:57:34,587 --> 00:57:37,423
Naz, you said out there
I didn't understand.

744
00:57:37,457 --> 00:57:38,424
And you're right, I don't.

745
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:41,493
That's what I'm trying to do here. I'm...

746
00:57:41,528 --> 00:57:44,063
It's why I'm here.

747
00:57:44,097 --> 00:57:46,398
To try to understand. To hear it from you.

748
00:57:46,433 --> 00:57:48,100
I don't have to do that, by the way.

749
00:57:48,134 --> 00:57:50,769
I want to.

750
00:57:50,804 --> 00:57:54,573
What you need to understand is what
you say to me here is very important.

751
00:57:54,607 --> 00:57:56,175
For you, not me.

752
00:57:56,209 --> 00:57:57,576
It can help you.

753
00:57:57,610 --> 00:57:59,812
I'm trying to help you. Help me help you.

754
00:58:02,749 --> 00:58:04,883
I can't breathe.

755
00:58:04,918 --> 00:58:06,018
Okay.

756
00:58:06,052 --> 00:58:08,253
That's okay, not uncommon. Just relax.

757
00:58:08,288 --> 00:58:09,455
No, I mean, I have asthma.

758
00:58:09,489 --> 00:58:12,224
Oh. You got something
to help you with that?

759
00:58:12,258 --> 00:58:14,159
No.

760
00:58:14,194 --> 00:58:15,928
You wanna go to the hospital?

761
00:58:17,597 --> 00:58:19,164
I wanna go home.

762
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,034
You still on hold?

763
00:58:22,068 --> 00:58:23,569
Yes, I am.

764
00:58:23,603 --> 00:58:25,738
Where is this hospital?

765
00:58:25,772 --> 00:58:27,306
It's here, where do you think?

766
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,508
Didn't he say he was going into Manhattan?

767
00:58:36,983 --> 00:58:39,585
"Is she dead?"

768
00:58:39,619 --> 00:58:41,086
What?

769
00:58:41,121 --> 00:58:44,523
That's what you asked the officers
in the car that brought you here.

770
00:58:44,557 --> 00:58:46,792
"Is she dead?"

771
00:58:46,826 --> 00:58:48,827
You don't remember saying that?

772
00:58:50,263 --> 00:58:53,098
They hadn't said anything
about her. Hadn't...

773
00:58:53,133 --> 00:58:55,100
said it was a she or a he,

774
00:58:55,135 --> 00:58:57,302
let alone dead, nobody had.

775
00:58:59,906 --> 00:59:03,475
So, you were at her place.
Can we agree on that?

776
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:05,377
You have a couple drinks.

777
00:59:05,412 --> 00:59:06,645
Maybe a kiss.

778
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:08,414
You have a couple more drinks and...

779
00:59:09,382 --> 00:59:11,917
And she's pretty, I know that. I saw her.

780
00:59:11,951 --> 00:59:13,552
What'd she do, say no?

781
00:59:13,586 --> 00:59:14,720
No.

782
00:59:14,754 --> 00:59:17,122
- Fought you?
- No.

783
00:59:17,157 --> 00:59:19,057
Then what happened, Naz?

784
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:24,296
I don't know. I fell asleep.

785
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:26,398
When I woke up,

786
00:59:26,433 --> 00:59:28,267
and she was like that...

787
00:59:28,301 --> 00:59:29,768
She was dead.

788
00:59:29,803 --> 00:59:31,770
And you, what did you do?

789
00:59:34,207 --> 00:59:36,074
I ran.

790
00:59:36,109 --> 00:59:38,243
'Cause I was scared.

791
00:59:38,278 --> 00:59:39,578
By what you'd done.

792
00:59:39,612 --> 00:59:41,280
No.

793
00:59:45,452 --> 00:59:48,020
What we're gonna do when we're done here,

794
00:59:48,054 --> 00:59:50,422
just so you know, is run some tests.

795
00:59:50,457 --> 00:59:52,524
You know why?

796
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:54,460
Because you're a crime scene, Nasir.

797
00:59:54,494 --> 00:59:56,462
Just like the house,
and the cab, and Andrea.

798
00:59:56,496 --> 01:00:00,699
And it's our job to collect
everything we can from a crime scene.

799
01:00:00,733 --> 01:00:03,335
And here's what we're
gonna find, if you ask me.

800
01:00:03,369 --> 01:00:05,537
Her in the cab, the cab on her,

801
01:00:05,572 --> 01:00:07,940
you in the house, the house on you,

802
01:00:07,974 --> 01:00:09,575
you on her, her on you,

803
01:00:09,609 --> 01:00:11,443
the knife on you, her on the knife.

804
01:00:11,478 --> 01:00:13,011
I didn't kill her.

805
01:00:13,046 --> 01:00:15,147
You had sex with her.

806
01:00:16,683 --> 01:00:19,284
Yes. But it wasn't...

807
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,254
I didn't force her.

808
01:00:22,288 --> 01:00:23,489
I didn't say you did.

809
01:00:23,523 --> 01:00:26,024
She's only the second girl
I've ever slept with in my life.

810
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:27,793
I liked her.

811
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:32,731
She was nice.

812
01:00:32,765 --> 01:00:34,633
Look, I'm gonna be straight with you, Naz.

813
01:00:34,667 --> 01:00:36,502
Because what I'm looking at,

814
01:00:36,536 --> 01:00:39,805
the evidence already, the
eyewitnesses are so strong...

815
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:42,841
you really need to start telling
me the truth for your sake.

816
01:00:42,876 --> 01:00:44,910
I am.

817
01:00:46,045 --> 01:00:47,546
You see that, right?

818
01:00:50,049 --> 01:00:51,583
That's recording us.

819
01:00:51,618 --> 01:00:53,185
And it will be used in court.

820
01:00:53,219 --> 01:00:55,087
How you think that's gonna come off?

821
01:00:55,121 --> 01:00:56,755
"She was nice, I liked her.

822
01:00:56,789 --> 01:00:58,123
But I killed her anyway."

823
01:00:58,157 --> 01:01:00,058
I didn't. I already told you, I...

824
01:01:01,361 --> 01:01:03,161
I can't remember.

825
01:01:03,196 --> 01:01:06,231
I have to tell you, that's
not gonna play any better.

826
01:01:06,266 --> 01:01:08,100
Judges and juries...

827
01:01:08,134 --> 01:01:10,068
they don't like "I can't remember."

828
01:01:10,103 --> 01:01:12,471
They like honesty. They like remorse.

829
01:01:12,505 --> 01:01:13,906
They like that a lot.

830
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:16,074
That counts for something to them.

831
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:18,510
And even more to you.

832
01:01:18,545 --> 01:01:20,245
I'm talking about years.

833
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:22,848
Honesty and remorse can
shave a lot of years off.

834
01:01:22,882 --> 01:01:25,918
So, you may want to revise that.

835
01:01:27,387 --> 01:01:29,121
Now's the time.

836
01:01:36,262 --> 01:01:37,529
All right.

837
01:01:37,564 --> 01:01:39,031
Let's go do what we have to do.

838
01:01:39,065 --> 01:01:40,866
We can talk again later.

839
01:01:48,608 --> 01:01:49,975
Come on.

840
01:01:56,583 --> 01:01:58,383
Take your clothes off.

841
01:02:21,074 --> 01:02:23,508
- What's...
- Shut the fuck up and take your shirt off.

842
01:02:41,327 --> 01:02:43,195
Don't look at me. Take your pants off.

843
01:03:22,735 --> 01:03:24,569
Sorry about that.

844
01:03:26,606 --> 01:03:29,808
Here. Put these on.

845
01:03:35,181 --> 01:03:36,648
Thank you.

846
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:01,540
Hello?

847
01:04:01,574 --> 01:04:04,776
How long do I have to be
in here? I got things to do.

848
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:12,551
No, that's okay.

849
01:04:14,287 --> 01:04:16,254
Would you hang on a second, please?

850
01:04:16,289 --> 01:04:19,791
- Gentlemen, how's the scene?
- It's the Battle of Gettysburg.

851
01:04:19,826 --> 01:04:21,560
We'll be there all day.
Where's the birthday boy?

852
01:04:21,594 --> 01:04:23,361
- Upstairs.
- Thanks.

853
01:04:23,396 --> 01:04:26,298
Can you spell your name for me?

854
01:04:26,332 --> 01:04:27,733
Hey, yo, excuse me, miss?

855
01:04:27,767 --> 01:04:29,434
Hey, yo, can I call my moms?

856
01:04:29,469 --> 01:04:30,769
Go, go, come on.

857
01:04:30,803 --> 01:04:33,405
All right, I'll have one of our
detectives get in touch with you.

858
01:04:33,439 --> 01:04:35,574
Turn to your left.

859
01:04:35,608 --> 01:04:36,875
Turn to the other side.

860
01:04:36,909 --> 01:04:38,176
Take your shirt off.

861
01:04:38,211 --> 01:04:41,046
Make sure you get some close-ups
on those back scratches.

862
01:04:42,682 --> 01:04:44,082
Get a shot of that.

863
01:04:45,651 --> 01:04:47,119
Put your arms up.

864
01:04:49,789 --> 01:04:51,556
All right, put your hand here.

865
01:04:53,192 --> 01:04:54,559
Turn it over.

866
01:04:54,594 --> 01:04:57,429
Let's get a close-up. Thank you.

867
01:04:59,532 --> 01:05:02,367
I'd like to get a little swab
of the blood on your hands.

868
01:05:02,401 --> 01:05:04,269
A little swipe under the nails.

869
01:05:04,303 --> 01:05:05,904
A little bit off the
scratches on your back.

870
01:05:05,938 --> 01:05:08,907
And inside your cheek. Okay if I do that?

871
01:05:08,941 --> 01:05:10,742
I don't know. Is it?

872
01:05:10,777 --> 01:05:12,344
I need your consent, Naz.

873
01:05:12,378 --> 01:05:14,713
If you don't give it, then
I have to get a court order.

874
01:05:14,747 --> 01:05:16,481
And that will take about 45 minutes.

875
01:05:16,516 --> 01:05:18,517
So, it's not a problem.

876
01:05:18,551 --> 01:05:19,885
Except for you.

877
01:05:19,919 --> 01:05:21,653
Refusing looks bad to a jury.

878
01:05:21,687 --> 01:05:23,255
And I really don't want you disadvantaged.

879
01:05:23,289 --> 01:05:25,357
But it's up to you.

880
01:05:25,391 --> 01:05:26,792
You can say no.

881
01:05:28,761 --> 01:05:30,228
I didn't do it.

882
01:05:30,263 --> 01:05:31,363
Well, there you have it.

883
01:05:31,397 --> 01:05:33,031
You got nothing to fear, so,

884
01:05:33,065 --> 01:05:34,432
shall we go ahead and do it then?

885
01:05:34,467 --> 01:05:36,201
Your call.

886
01:05:38,571 --> 01:05:40,472
Say the words for me, Naz.

887
01:05:40,506 --> 01:05:41,807
Yes.

888
01:05:52,718 --> 01:05:54,219
Open your mouth.

889
01:06:00,827 --> 01:06:02,494
Oh, one more thing.

890
01:06:02,528 --> 01:06:04,629
I'm gonna need a penile swab, too.

891
01:06:04,664 --> 01:06:06,965
Is it okay if we do that next?

892
01:06:08,501 --> 01:06:09,901
Yes?

893
01:06:11,103 --> 01:06:12,470
Okay.

894
01:06:19,745 --> 01:06:20,912
You want me to stay?

895
01:06:22,415 --> 01:06:23,748
Will it hurt?

896
01:06:24,984 --> 01:06:26,351
No.

897
01:06:26,385 --> 01:06:28,019
Stand up.

898
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:32,724
Drop your pants.

899
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:50,709
That's good, good.

900
01:06:52,578 --> 01:06:54,546
Just... just relax.

901
01:07:00,152 --> 01:07:02,053
I think we're about done here?

902
01:07:02,088 --> 01:07:04,155
Box wanted palms and tips, too.

903
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:06,958
- I didn't hear him say that.
- Then don't do it.

904
01:07:06,993 --> 01:07:08,960
All right, try not to shake too much.

905
01:07:20,273 --> 01:07:22,340
I want a lawyer.

906
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:24,209
Oh, yeah, why?

907
01:07:24,243 --> 01:07:26,111
What do you mean, why?

908
01:07:26,145 --> 01:07:28,246
You know what kind of message that sends?

909
01:07:28,281 --> 01:07:31,049
Hey, what do we know. We're
just crime scene unit guys.

910
01:07:31,083 --> 01:07:33,652
So, why don't you wait till
the squad detectives come back,

911
01:07:33,686 --> 01:07:35,420
and get into all that with them.

912
01:07:35,454 --> 01:07:38,456
Seriously though, kid, look
before you leap, is what I say.

913
01:07:38,491 --> 01:07:40,458
Okay. We're done here.

914
01:07:42,995 --> 01:07:44,296
Wipe up.

915
01:07:50,269 --> 01:07:51,603
Here's my card.

916
01:07:51,637 --> 01:07:54,806
250 bucks. I'll meet you there.

917
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,308
You'll be okay.

918
01:07:56,342 --> 01:07:58,777
Will you take a check?

919
01:07:58,811 --> 01:08:00,545
- For you, Paul?
- Pauline.

920
01:08:00,579 --> 01:08:03,248
Pauline, I'm sorry.

921
01:08:03,282 --> 01:08:05,951
A cashier's check's okay.

922
01:08:31,811 --> 01:08:34,980
Hey, what's with Gunga Din in there?

923
01:08:35,014 --> 01:08:37,248
- Who?
- The big-eyed kid.

924
01:08:37,283 --> 01:08:39,684
- The kid?
- Yeah, in the pen.

925
01:08:39,719 --> 01:08:41,019
Oh, him.

926
01:08:41,053 --> 01:08:43,021
He cut a girl on 87th Street.

927
01:08:43,055 --> 01:08:45,490
Who did?

928
01:08:45,524 --> 01:08:50,061
They're called razors, Jack,
you should invest. Experiment.

929
01:08:50,096 --> 01:08:52,864
Worse comes to worst, it all grows back.

930
01:09:19,825 --> 01:09:21,126
All right, my man.

931
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,762
All we need now is the
knife and clothes and shoes.

932
01:09:23,796 --> 01:09:26,064
I sent all that over before you got here.

933
01:09:26,098 --> 01:09:27,232
Who did?

934
01:09:27,266 --> 01:09:28,700
Two of my unis drove it over.

935
01:09:29,702 --> 01:09:31,403
You always break chain
of evidence like that?

936
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:34,105
Relax. It's all there, neat and tidy.

937
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:36,441
Here's a voucher.

938
01:09:36,475 --> 01:09:38,910
- They handed it to Mathis?
- He's their dispatcher?

939
01:09:38,944 --> 01:09:42,147
Apparently with the Battle of Gettysburg
and all, he was the only one there.

940
01:09:42,181 --> 01:09:44,182
Hey, nobody told me you were coming here.

941
01:09:44,216 --> 01:09:46,751
Yet here we are.

942
01:09:46,786 --> 01:09:49,287
Thought I was doing you guys
a favor. The fuck do I know?

943
01:09:49,321 --> 01:09:51,056
Next time, wait for us.

944
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:52,924
Next time, call first.

945
01:09:57,997 --> 01:09:59,297
What are you doing?

946
01:09:59,331 --> 01:10:01,232
I'm here to see my client.

947
01:10:01,267 --> 01:10:04,035
- You just did.
- Not him... her.

948
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:05,403
Him.

949
01:10:19,452 --> 01:10:22,620
Your man is here, as it were,

950
01:10:22,655 --> 01:10:24,255
Johnny the Red.

951
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:26,224
Bye now.

952
01:10:27,793 --> 01:10:30,095
And don't lose that key!

953
01:10:30,129 --> 01:10:32,831
25 years, the Berlin Wall comes down,

954
01:10:32,865 --> 01:10:37,235
and this throwback's still
going on about communists.

955
01:10:37,269 --> 01:10:40,605
So, Nazir... Nasir.

956
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:42,874
Is that what I call you or...

957
01:10:42,908 --> 01:10:44,709
- Naz.
- You're a citizen, Naz?

958
01:10:44,743 --> 01:10:45,710
What... who are you?

959
01:10:45,744 --> 01:10:48,012
Your lawyer. You a U.S. citizen?

960
01:10:48,047 --> 01:10:49,447
- You're like, a public defender?
- No.

961
01:10:49,482 --> 01:10:50,715
You're a citizen?

962
01:10:50,749 --> 01:10:51,716
Yeah.

963
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:53,351
Guess number one:

964
01:10:53,385 --> 01:10:55,253
Pakistani by blood?

965
01:10:55,287 --> 01:10:56,788
- Yeah, my mom.
- What is she?

966
01:10:56,822 --> 01:10:59,390
Punjabi, Pashtun, Baluch?

967
01:10:59,425 --> 01:11:01,126
Punjabi.

968
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,061
- You been to Pakistan?
- No.

969
01:11:03,095 --> 01:11:04,696
Have you?

970
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:05,864
No.

971
01:11:09,001 --> 01:11:10,335
It's eczema.

972
01:11:10,369 --> 01:11:12,170
Dermatologist says to keep them aerated.

973
01:11:12,204 --> 01:11:13,905
Like that's gonna cure anything.

974
01:11:13,939 --> 01:11:16,141
I don't know, maybe it
helps. I really can't tell.

975
01:11:16,175 --> 01:11:17,709
You ever been arrested?

976
01:11:17,743 --> 01:11:18,610
No.

977
01:11:18,644 --> 01:11:21,246
- Pissing in public, littering, anything?
- No.

978
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:24,449
Well, first time for everything, right?

979
01:11:25,584 --> 01:11:27,018
Don't worry about my feet.

980
01:11:27,052 --> 01:11:28,386
It's not contagious.

981
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:29,587
How's your politics?

982
01:11:29,622 --> 01:11:30,755
What do you mean, my politics?

983
01:11:30,789 --> 01:11:32,557
Well, not to sound like a tea-bagger,

984
01:11:32,591 --> 01:11:34,759
but how do you feel about America?

985
01:11:34,793 --> 01:11:37,228
Well, I'm American. I was born here.

986
01:11:37,263 --> 01:11:40,265
Name two Yankees headed
for the Hall of Fame?

987
01:11:40,299 --> 01:11:41,866
- Why?
- One Mississippi...

988
01:11:41,901 --> 01:11:43,101
Rivera and Jeter.

989
01:11:43,135 --> 01:11:45,036
Good.

990
01:11:45,070 --> 01:11:46,204
Married?

991
01:11:46,238 --> 01:11:48,039
No.

992
01:11:48,073 --> 01:11:51,242
So, as a good Muslim boy,
you live with your parents?

993
01:11:51,277 --> 01:11:52,243
Yeah.

994
01:11:52,278 --> 01:11:53,478
Talk to them yet?

995
01:11:53,512 --> 01:11:54,579
They took my phone.

996
01:11:54,613 --> 01:11:55,647
Talk to anyone?

997
01:11:55,681 --> 01:11:56,915
N... What do you mean?

998
01:11:56,949 --> 01:11:58,750
- Here.
- Like, who?

999
01:11:58,784 --> 01:12:01,553
It's not a tough question.
Like cops, who else is there?

1000
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:03,221
Uh, I talked to one.

1001
01:12:03,255 --> 01:12:04,889
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

1002
01:12:04,924 --> 01:12:07,659
Tell me he told you you had to?

1003
01:12:07,693 --> 01:12:09,527
He didn't.

1004
01:12:09,562 --> 01:12:11,829
Tell me he didn't read you your rights?

1005
01:12:11,864 --> 01:12:14,232
They did.

1006
01:12:18,704 --> 01:12:20,371
I may need you to come down again.

1007
01:12:20,406 --> 01:12:22,874
So, don't like, run off to
Europe without telling me.

1008
01:12:22,908 --> 01:12:27,212
Do I look like someone running
off to Europe anytime soon?

1009
01:12:27,246 --> 01:12:29,280
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1010
01:12:29,315 --> 01:12:31,783
You may go home and get some sleep now.

1011
01:12:38,724 --> 01:12:39,991
Almost done?

1012
01:12:40,025 --> 01:12:41,259
Yeah. You?

1013
01:12:41,293 --> 01:12:42,727
Yeah.

1014
01:12:42,761 --> 01:12:44,896
Let's get out of here before they...

1015
01:12:44,930 --> 01:12:46,264
Don't look up.

1016
01:12:48,634 --> 01:12:50,702
Hit print, let's go.

1017
01:12:50,736 --> 01:12:52,403
You two were first on the scene, right?

1018
01:12:52,438 --> 01:12:54,439
Yeah. Just finished the DD-5s.

1019
01:12:54,473 --> 01:12:56,207
Everything's done. We're going home.

1020
01:12:57,176 --> 01:12:58,509
Upstairs.

1021
01:12:58,544 --> 01:13:01,746
Sir, we were supposed to
be off like five hours ago.

1022
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:03,848
- Really?
- Yeah.

1023
01:13:03,882 --> 01:13:06,050
- So...
- So come upstairs.

1024
01:13:12,925 --> 01:13:14,692
This was when?

1025
01:13:14,727 --> 01:13:17,161
I don't know, what time is it now, 4:00?

1026
01:13:17,196 --> 01:13:18,363
6:00.

1027
01:13:18,397 --> 01:13:20,798
6:00! What time am I getting out of here?

1028
01:13:20,833 --> 01:13:24,068
Never, if you keep answering
questions with questions.

1029
01:13:27,006 --> 01:13:28,573
What was the question again?

1030
01:13:28,607 --> 01:13:30,808
What time it was when you saw them,

1031
01:13:30,843 --> 01:13:33,378
as you put it, rubbing
up against each other?

1032
01:13:33,412 --> 01:13:35,780
I wanna say...

1033
01:13:35,814 --> 01:13:37,615
10:00, 11:00, something like that.

1034
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:39,083
You were alone?

1035
01:13:40,152 --> 01:13:41,619
Yeah.

1036
01:13:41,654 --> 01:13:42,787
Doing what?

1037
01:13:42,821 --> 01:13:44,055
Just walking.

1038
01:13:44,089 --> 01:13:47,358
On West 87th Street a block from the park?

1039
01:13:47,393 --> 01:13:49,627
The fuck is that supposed to mean?

1040
01:13:54,133 --> 01:13:55,466
Is this her?

1041
01:13:56,969 --> 01:13:58,603
Yeah, that's her.

1042
01:14:00,372 --> 01:14:01,606
Is he on this?

1043
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:04,375
I just told you that was
him out there on the floor,

1044
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:06,844
like, hours ago. What
more do you want from me?

1045
01:14:06,879 --> 01:14:08,346
I want you to look at it,

1046
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:10,448
and tell me if he's on it or not.

1047
01:14:17,122 --> 01:14:20,091
This towelhead right here.

1048
01:14:20,125 --> 01:14:22,193
Just the number, not the op-ed.

1049
01:14:22,227 --> 01:14:24,862
Four. Number four.

1050
01:14:24,897 --> 01:14:26,864
Initial it for me.

1051
01:14:35,107 --> 01:14:36,374
Thank you, Trevor.

1052
01:14:40,312 --> 01:14:42,880
Okay, Naz, listen to me,

1053
01:14:42,915 --> 01:14:45,183
don't talk to anybody anymore.

1054
01:14:45,217 --> 01:14:47,318
Anyone asks you anything, how you doing,

1055
01:14:47,353 --> 01:14:48,553
isn't it a nice day?

1056
01:14:48,587 --> 01:14:49,787
You say, "Gee, I don't know.

1057
01:14:49,822 --> 01:14:52,790
Talk to my lawyer." Okay? Say it.

1058
01:14:52,825 --> 01:14:55,059
- Okay.
- No, no, say that to me.

1059
01:14:55,094 --> 01:14:56,160
I don't know...

1060
01:14:56,195 --> 01:14:57,462
- I don't know.
- Talk to...

1061
01:14:57,496 --> 01:14:58,663
Talk to my lawyer.

1062
01:14:58,697 --> 01:15:01,332
Good. I've been an "I
don't know" guy all my life.

1063
01:15:01,367 --> 01:15:03,901
It's never let me down.

1064
01:15:03,936 --> 01:15:05,036
Where are you going?

1065
01:15:05,070 --> 01:15:07,572
To see if I can get you
out of here. Short of that,

1066
01:15:07,606 --> 01:15:09,040
get your phone call.

1067
01:15:10,676 --> 01:15:12,110
You know what they're saying I did?

1068
01:15:12,144 --> 01:15:13,911
I don't. And I don't care.

1069
01:15:13,946 --> 01:15:16,414
Until they charge you,
you didn't do anything.

1070
01:15:17,783 --> 01:15:19,283
Guard!

1071
01:15:24,490 --> 01:15:26,591
Don't go anywhere.

1072
01:15:26,625 --> 01:15:27,892
Thanks, Wayne.

1073
01:15:30,429 --> 01:15:32,163
You know what I wonder?

1074
01:15:32,197 --> 01:15:33,831
Where'd it all go wrong?

1075
01:15:33,866 --> 01:15:36,501
The cop who first built
one of these counters,

1076
01:15:36,535 --> 01:15:38,403
how tall you think he was?

1077
01:15:41,473 --> 01:15:43,474
I want to take the kid out of here.

1078
01:15:43,509 --> 01:15:44,475
No shit.

1079
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:45,777
Is he being charged?

1080
01:15:45,811 --> 01:15:47,779
- Oh, yeah.
- With?

1081
01:15:47,813 --> 01:15:49,447
Possession of a weapon, for now.

1082
01:15:49,481 --> 01:15:52,250
Misdemeanor desk appearance.
Let's get him to a judge.

1083
01:15:52,284 --> 01:15:55,253
Not gonna happen. They like him
for this 87th Street thing big time.

1084
01:15:55,287 --> 01:15:56,554
Who's they?

1085
01:15:56,588 --> 01:15:57,622
Box.

1086
01:15:57,656 --> 01:15:59,924
The fuck's he got to do with it?

1087
01:15:59,958 --> 01:16:01,225
What do you think?

1088
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:03,628
Lieberman said he cut a girl.

1089
01:16:03,662 --> 01:16:05,563
"Cut" is right.

1090
01:16:07,332 --> 01:16:10,101
- She's dead?
- Uh-huh.

1091
01:16:12,070 --> 01:16:13,738
And it's Box?

1092
01:16:13,772 --> 01:16:15,640
Uh-huh.

1093
01:16:15,674 --> 01:16:16,974
Fuck.

1094
01:16:29,087 --> 01:16:30,121
Naz?

1095
01:16:31,223 --> 01:16:34,258
Listen, I'm at a police station.

1096
01:16:34,293 --> 01:16:36,661
And it... it's all a mistake.

1097
01:16:36,695 --> 01:16:39,564
They've arrested me. They
think I did something.

1098
01:16:44,603 --> 01:16:46,237
Murder.

1099
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:53,444
Is he hurt?

1100
01:17:25,606 --> 01:17:30,606

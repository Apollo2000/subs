He was stone intox, like, crash-landed.

- You didn't administer?
- Didn't get the chance.

25

Call came in. We had to take him with us.

00:02:40,132 --> 00:02:41,732
Couldn't have him driving
off in that condition.

27
00:02:41,834 --> 00:02:43,867
I was running a check on
him when a call came in,

28
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:46,036
so we put him in the car and responded.

29
00:02:46,138 --> 00:02:47,571
And then we found the girl.

00:02:47,673 --> 00:02:50,674
Apparently, you vomited,
up there in the crime scene.

31
00:02:50,776 --> 00:02:52,543
I was gagging, not puking.

That's nothing to be ashamed of.

No, no. I'm just saying, you know?

34
00:02:55,247 --> 00:02:56,713
I just wanna be really clear about that,

35
00:02:56,816 --> 00:02:59,183
'cause Bell's been going around
telling everybody I was puking.

36
00:02:59,285 --> 00:03:00,918
At any point when you
had him in your custody,

37
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,719
did he say or do anything unusual?

38
00:03:02,822 --> 00:03:05,456
No. He was as quiet as a mouse.

39
00:03:11,097 --> 00:03:12,563

Don't worry, Pauline. I'll be there.

43
00:03:32,618 --> 00:03:34,585
We'll settle up with the money after.

You're asthmatic, huh?

45
00:03:40,593 --> 00:03:42,359
I used to have it when I was a kid.

46
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:44,261
I know it when I hear it.
You might grow out of it.

It's the same family as eczema,

only that just keeps getting worse.

49
00:03:50,736 --> 00:03:52,736
But I'm not sure how it's gonna play.

50
00:03:52,838 --> 00:03:54,338
- What?
- The asthma.

51
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:57,508
It might not be a bad thing.

52

Well, then again, a knife-wielding,

- Mm.

00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:08,886
Okay. You need to understand
what happened here, all right?

56
00:04:08,988 --> 00:04:11,321
We were at her place, we
were drinking. I don't drink.

57
00:04:11,423 --> 00:04:12,689
And she started giving me all kinds...

58
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:13,790
I wanna tell you something,

59
00:04:13,893 --> 00:04:15,225
and it's the most important thing

60
00:04:15,327 --> 00:04:17,027
you'll ever hear in your entire life,

61
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:19,630
so don't not hear it.

62
00:04:19,732 --> 00:04:20,998
Shut it!

63
00:04:22,368 --> 00:04:24,201
They come up with their story,

64
00:04:24,303 --> 00:04:25,736
we come up with ours.

65
00:04:25,838 --> 00:04:28,338
The jury gets to decide
which they like best.

66
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,806
Now, the good news is

67
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:32,109
we get to hear what their story is first

68
00:04:32,211 --> 00:04:33,911
before we have to tell them ours.

69
00:04:34,013 --> 00:04:35,479
So we keep our mouths shut

70
00:04:35,581 --> 00:04:37,681
until we know what they're doing.

71
00:04:37,783 --> 00:04:39,550
You keep saying "story,"
like I'm making it up.

72
00:04:39,652 --> 00:04:41,151
I want to tell you the truth.

73
00:04:41,253 --> 00:04:44,288
You really, really don't. I don't
wanna be stuck with the truth.

It's not her.

168
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:25,849
You sure?

169
00:12:25,951 --> 00:12:27,684
Of course I'm sure. It's not her.

170
00:12:28,787 --> 00:12:31,955
All right, Mr. Taylor. I understand.

171
00:12:33,892 --> 00:12:36,126
Let's go take a look at the body itself.

172
00:12:37,729 --> 00:12:38,728
Why?

173
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,064
Just to be sure. This way.

174
00:12:50,175 --> 00:12:51,875
It's her.

175
00:13:18,003 --> 00:13:19,269
Hey, Joey. How you doing?

176
00:13:19,371 --> 00:13:20,503
(indistinct)

177
00:13:23,275 --> 00:13:26,209
Excuse me, sir. I'm an attorney
and I'm late for my trial.

178
00:13:30,015 --> 00:13:32,482
Excuse me. I'm an attorney
and I'm late for my trial.

179
00:13:32,584 --> 00:13:34,050
Yeah? Who is it? Get in line.

180
00:13:34,152 --> 00:13:36,286
- Can I...
- No. Mm-mm.

181
00:13:45,397 --> 00:13:47,330
Hi. We're here to see our son.

182
00:13:47,432 --> 00:13:48,698
Is he a collar?

183
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,233
What? Yes. He called us.

184
00:13:50,335 --> 00:13:51,634
Is he arrested, I'm asking.

185
00:13:51,737 --> 00:13:54,204
Sorry, no... Yes, but it was a mistake.

186
00:13:54,306 --> 00:13:56,573
Always is. Name?

187
00:13:56,675 --> 00:13:58,041
Salim Khan.

188
00:13:59,177 --> 00:14:00,910
(sighs)

189
00:14:02,414 --> 00:14:03,713
No Salim Khan here.

190
00:14:03,815 --> 00:14:05,782
No. My name is Salim, I'm sorry.

191
00:14:05,884 --> 00:14:07,751
His is Nasir. He's our son.

192
00:14:07,853 --> 00:14:10,887
Nasir. Nasir Khan.

193
00:14:10,989 --> 00:14:11,988
Nope.

194
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,090
I don't understand. He called us.

195
00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:15,792
He told us that he'd been arrested.

196
00:14:15,894 --> 00:14:17,393
- Where?
- Here, in Manhattan.

197
00:14:17,496 --> 00:14:18,962
Where in Manhattan?

198
00:14:19,064 --> 00:14:20,830
Did he say?

199
00:14:20,932 --> 00:14:22,332
No.

200
00:14:22,434 --> 00:14:24,000
I don't know.

201
00:14:24,936 --> 00:14:25,869
What did he do?

202
00:14:25,971 --> 00:14:28,338
Someone was killed, and they think that...

203
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,373
It's crazy, but they think he did it.

204
00:14:30,475 --> 00:14:32,742
Any homicides last night?

205
00:14:32,844 --> 00:14:35,345
Some Muslim freak carved
up a girl in the 2-1.

206
00:14:36,281 --> 00:14:37,680
You're in the wrong precinct.

207
00:14:37,783 --> 00:14:40,416
This is the 1-2. You
gotta go to the 2-1.

208
00:14:42,454 --> 00:14:43,419
Thank you.

209
00:14:43,522 --> 00:14:44,821
All right. Good luck.

210
00:15:02,452 --> 00:15:04,028
_

211
00:15:17,556 --> 00:15:18,922
(alarm beeping)

212
00:15:19,024 --> 00:15:20,824
You gotta be kidding me.

213
00:15:20,926 --> 00:15:21,991
Arms out.

214
00:15:25,297 --> 00:15:26,429
Shoes off.

215
00:15:26,531 --> 00:15:28,698
I don't think you want me to do that.

216
00:15:33,271 --> 00:15:35,238
- Is it contagious?
- No.

217
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,639
But still.

218
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:38,141
All right. Go on.

219
00:15:39,077 --> 00:15:40,276
Next.

220
00:15:40,378 --> 00:15:42,545
Woman: We'll notify you when
we're done with the decedent.

221
00:15:42,647 --> 00:15:45,615
In the meantime, you need to choose
a state-licensed funeral home...

222
00:15:45,717 --> 00:15:47,350
we are prohibited from recommending one...

223
00:15:47,452 --> 00:15:49,452
and give us their contact information.

224
00:15:49,554 --> 00:15:51,054
Since this is a criminal case,

225
00:15:51,156 --> 00:15:53,456
the personal property of
the decedent will be held

226
00:15:53,558 --> 00:15:56,259
until after trial and appeals, if any.

227
00:15:56,361 --> 00:15:59,529
Sign here I've told you this
information and you understand it.

228
00:16:20,218 --> 00:16:22,018
Box: Mr. Taylor?

229
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:28,124
I want to say I'm sorry.

230
00:16:28,226 --> 00:16:31,194
I know it's hard coming down
here and doing what you just did.

231
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,097
I didn't want to see her.

232
00:16:36,668 --> 00:16:38,134
Is that bad?

233
00:16:38,236 --> 00:16:40,036
Completely understandable.

234
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,973
What happened?

235
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,543
That's what we're trying to figure out.

236
00:16:47,646 --> 00:16:49,279
You can be helpful.

237
00:16:49,381 --> 00:16:53,316
Maybe we could go sit somewhere
and talk, if that's all right.

238
00:17:01,026 --> 00:17:02,158
Where's your tie?

239
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,093
I don't have a tie.

240
00:17:04,195 --> 00:17:06,362
You cheated a lot of people, Mr. Gerwitz,

241
00:17:06,464 --> 00:17:08,364
and you did it with a
smile and a handshake.

242
00:17:08,466 --> 00:17:10,033
I'll never live it down, Judge.

243
00:17:10,135 --> 00:17:12,135
And I'll never stop trying to make amends.

244
00:17:12,237 --> 00:17:14,570
Eh, someone pass me a hankie.

245
00:17:14,673 --> 00:17:18,308
I'm sentencing you to 18 months in
the Franklin Correctional Facility.

246
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,711
No, you will not be able to
work on your backhand there.

247
00:17:21,813 --> 00:17:24,314
Eighteen months? That's all he get?

248
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:25,615
Gerwitz: I deserve it, Your Honor.

249
00:17:25,717 --> 00:17:27,917
Judge: You bet you do. Next.

250
00:17:34,192 --> 00:17:35,458
Talk to him.

251
00:17:38,063 --> 00:17:40,863
Hi. We'd like to see our son.

252
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:42,465
His name is Nasir Khan.

253
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:44,133
The Khan kid, how old is he?

254
00:17:45,337 --> 00:17:47,003
How should I know?

255
00:17:47,105 --> 00:17:48,304
Twenty-three.

256
00:17:48,406 --> 00:17:49,839
Can't do it then.

257
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:50,807
Why?

258
00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:52,675
Five tokes over the line.

259
00:17:52,777 --> 00:17:54,644
(indistinct)

260
00:17:54,746 --> 00:17:56,846
Excuse me. What?

261
00:17:56,948 --> 00:17:58,948
He's an adult.

262
00:18:03,488 --> 00:18:04,954
We are not leaving.

263
00:18:05,857 --> 00:18:07,357
Free country.

264
00:18:14,432 --> 00:18:17,433
On the phone, you thought I was
calling to say she'd been arrested.

265
00:18:17,535 --> 00:18:18,968
She's been in trouble before?

266
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,670
Mm-hmm.

267
00:18:20,772 --> 00:18:22,071
What kind?

268
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,474
Drugs, mainly.

269
00:18:24,576 --> 00:18:25,675
Which?

270
00:18:26,678 --> 00:18:28,211
You name it.

271
00:18:28,313 --> 00:18:29,912
Forgive me for asking this.

272
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:33,716
It's only because we're trying to
determine if she knew her attacker.

273
00:18:33,818 --> 00:18:35,752
Was she involved in prostitution?

274
00:18:35,854 --> 00:18:37,086
No.

275
00:18:39,024 --> 00:18:40,723
When I say no, I think no.

276
00:18:40,825 --> 00:18:42,091
You don't know for sure?

277
00:18:42,193 --> 00:18:44,527
There's a lot I don't know about her.

278
00:18:44,629 --> 00:18:46,929
Her mother and I weren't
married all that long.

279
00:18:47,032 --> 00:18:48,731
Where's her mother?

280
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:51,934
She died last year, cancer.

281
00:18:52,037 --> 00:18:53,603
Sorry to hear.

282
00:18:53,705 --> 00:18:55,171
Her father?

283
00:18:55,273 --> 00:18:58,641
Died when Andrea was like... 10.

284
00:18:58,743 --> 00:19:01,344
He was quite a bit older than Evelyn...

285
00:19:01,446 --> 00:19:02,578
my wife.

286
00:19:03,481 --> 00:19:04,881
She go to school?

287
00:19:04,983 --> 00:19:06,149
Not for a while.

288
00:19:06,251 --> 00:19:07,316
Job?

289
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:09,752
Job? No.

290
00:19:09,854 --> 00:19:10,787
Boyfriend?

291
00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:11,888
Lots of those.

292
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,757
She ever mention the name Nasir Khan?

293
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:16,225
Goes by Naz.

294
00:19:16,327 --> 00:19:18,361
Is that who did it?

295
00:19:18,463 --> 00:19:20,496
- He's a suspect.
- In custody?

296
00:19:20,598 --> 00:19:22,265
We're talking to him. Do you know him?

297
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:25,201
Naz?

298
00:19:26,271 --> 00:19:27,837
No. Did she know him?

299
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:29,739
She may have just met him.

300
00:19:29,841 --> 00:19:31,407
I'd like to show you some pictures.

301
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:32,909
I don't want to see those.

302
00:19:33,011 --> 00:19:34,644
Not of her, of him.

303
00:19:35,513 --> 00:19:37,647
In case you've seen him around.

304
00:19:42,754 --> 00:19:43,886
He's an Arab?

305
00:19:43,988 --> 00:19:44,821
No.

306
00:19:44,923 --> 00:19:47,623
- He's not an Arab?
- No.

307
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:51,027
What are they?

308
00:19:51,129 --> 00:19:53,229
Any of them look familiar?

309
00:19:57,502 --> 00:19:58,568
No.

310
00:19:59,604 --> 00:20:01,737
The house will be sealed for a while.

311
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,506
You got some place you can stay?

312
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:05,041
I don't live there.

313
00:20:05,143 --> 00:20:07,844
It's Andrea's house, her mother's.

314
00:20:08,746 --> 00:20:10,780
I live in Queens.

315
00:20:12,517 --> 00:20:14,150
Three years to commence immediately

316
00:20:14,252 --> 00:20:16,152
at the Cape Vincent Correctional Center.

317
00:20:16,254 --> 00:20:17,453
You'll like it up there, Mr. G.

318
00:20:17,555 --> 00:20:20,423
Right on the border with
Canada, no frets about humidity.

319
00:20:20,525 --> 00:20:21,357
Next.

320
00:20:21,459 --> 00:20:23,359
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Three years?

321
00:20:23,461 --> 00:20:25,962
How come I can't get time like the Jew guy?

322
00:20:27,765 --> 00:20:29,232
You want Jew time?

323
00:20:29,334 --> 00:20:30,800
Do a Jew crime.

324
00:20:30,902 --> 00:20:31,801
Next.

325
00:20:31,903 --> 00:20:32,902
Thank you, Your Honor.

326
00:20:33,004 --> 00:20:34,770
I think what he meant to say was...

327
00:20:34,873 --> 00:20:36,372
- Next.
- Thank you. Let's go.

328
00:20:36,474 --> 00:20:38,107
Come on. Let's go.

329

(indistinct conversation)

331
00:21:08,373 --> 00:21:09,672
His parents?

332
00:21:09,774 --> 00:21:11,073
Yeah. They wanted to see him.

333
00:21:11,176 --> 00:21:13,342

No. Stone. I have no idea who that is.

He was just here, as far

You want me to argue with you a

00:25:13,951 --> 00:25:15,584
I had to ask.

408
00:25:15,686 --> 00:25:17,586
You did.

409
00:25:17,688 --> 00:25:18,954
But did you before?

410
00:25:19,056 --> 00:25:20,289
Box: Didn't have to before.

411
00:25:20,391 --> 00:25:22,258
You hadn't swooped down on him yet.

412
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,626
"Swooped"?

413
00:25:23,728 --> 00:25:25,661
That's a strong word.

414
00:25:25,763 --> 00:25:27,930
I feel for him.

415
00:25:28,032 --> 00:25:29,398
I'm sure you do.

416
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,468
I do. I let him talk to
his distraught parents.

417
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:34,870
Yeah? You tape it?

418
00:25:34,972 --> 00:25:37,406
This is a little out of
your league, isn't it, John?

419
00:25:39,043 --> 00:25:41,444
Bloomberg would've been
appalled by the snacks here.

420
00:25:41,546 --> 00:25:44,280
You're not gonna get rich off of
it, if that's what you're thinking.

421
00:25:44,382 --> 00:25:46,549
It's gonna be the
shortest trial in history.

422
00:25:46,651 --> 00:25:49,151
Yeah? Is that why you haven't charged him?

423
00:25:50,621 --> 00:25:52,221
Doesn't feel right for it, does he?

424
00:25:52,323 --> 00:25:54,990
Something in your gut
isn't liking him for this,

425
00:25:55,092 --> 00:25:57,593
and you can't bring
yourself to pull the switch.

426
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,477
Mr. and Mrs. Khan?

427
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:17,446
I'm John Stone, your son's attorney.

428
00:26:17,548 --> 00:26:19,148
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

429
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,282
Thank you.

430
00:26:20,384 --> 00:26:21,517
Would you like one?

431
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:22,852
No, thank you.

432
00:26:23,821 --> 00:26:25,421
How about you?

433
00:26:25,523 --> 00:26:26,722
Hmm.

434
00:26:26,824 --> 00:26:29,458
Come on. We'll talk a little bit over here.

435
00:26:30,962 --> 00:26:32,661
I don't know what they have
and what they don't have,

436
00:26:32,763 --> 00:26:35,264
but if they had what they
needed, he'd be charged by now,

437
00:26:35,366 --> 00:26:36,532
and he hasn't been.

438
00:26:36,634 --> 00:26:38,067
Other than possession of the knife.

439
00:26:38,169 --> 00:26:39,401
They can hold him on that.

440
00:26:39,504 --> 00:26:42,471
But this is good. It means
they're not sure about the rest.

441
00:26:42,573 --> 00:26:44,974
In any case, there's nothing
you can do sitting here waiting.

442
00:26:45,076 --> 00:26:48,344
You should go home. I'll let you
know the minute something changes.

443
00:26:49,247 --> 00:26:50,846
You understand what I just said?

444
00:26:51,749 --> 00:26:52,715
- Yeah.
- Yes.

445
00:26:52,817 --> 00:26:53,749
Of course.

446
00:26:53,851 --> 00:26:56,018
But he didn't do this.

447
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,853
Of course he didn't.

448
00:26:59,423 --> 00:27:00,489
I...

449
00:27:01,726 --> 00:27:03,092
will call you.

450
00:27:05,997 --> 00:27:09,031
I told you not to talk to anybody.

451
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:10,399
I didn't, only to my parents.

452
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:11,767
I said anybody.

453
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:14,336
While you were talking to them,
you know who was listening in,

454
00:27:14,438 --> 00:27:17,406
which he can do legally,
just not with me and you?

455
00:27:17,508 --> 00:27:18,674
Box.

456
00:27:18,776 --> 00:27:19,909
I... I didn't say anything.

457
00:27:20,011 --> 00:27:21,977
Sure you did. You had a
conversation. You conversed.

458
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:26,215
And I won't know exactly what you
said until it shows up in court.

459
00:27:26,317 --> 00:27:27,416
I... I said I didn't do it.

460
00:27:27,518 --> 00:27:29,885
I don't understand how
the truth can hurt me.

461
00:27:29,987 --> 00:27:32,354
Again with this. Christ!

462
00:27:32,456 --> 00:27:35,858
Okay, Naz, you're the jury.

463
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,160
Run the truth by yourself.

464
00:27:38,262 --> 00:27:40,129
Who killed this girl?

465
00:27:40,231 --> 00:27:41,430
Someone else?

466
00:27:41,532 --> 00:27:43,799
Or the guy with blood on him,
his fingerprints on everything,

467
00:27:43,901 --> 00:27:45,868
and the murder weapon in his pocket?

468
00:27:47,505 --> 00:27:49,638
The truth can go to hell

469
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,075
because it doesn't help you.

470
00:27:53,177 --> 00:27:57,846
And if you can't get that
through your head, right now,

471
00:27:57,949 --> 00:28:00,215
you can forget about the rest of your life.

472
00:28:06,591 --> 00:28:07,890
You think I did it.

473
00:28:08,793 --> 00:28:10,259
I don't think anything.

474
00:28:11,762 --> 00:28:13,896
Man: Khan? What is that, Arabic?

475
00:28:13,998 --> 00:28:14,997
Box: Pakistani.

476
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:17,466
- What is he saying?
- He didn't do it.

477
00:28:17,568 --> 00:28:19,168
- Do what?
- Exactly.

478
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:22,304
You call the DA yet?
You're gonna have to soon.

479
00:28:22,406 --> 00:28:24,239
And I will.

480
00:28:24,342 --> 00:28:26,208
Well, this is a... This is a lock?

481
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,544
Prints, weapons, witnesses. We got it all.

482
00:28:28,646 --> 00:28:30,145
- Nonetheless...
- I know.

483
00:28:30,247 --> 00:28:32,181
A confession would be deadly.

484
00:28:37,154 --> 00:28:38,487
(door slams)

485
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:42,024

(siren wailing)

487
00:28:52,637 --> 00:28:54,370
It's an ambulance siren, John.

488
00:28:54,472 --> 00:28:56,071
If you hurry, you could probably catch it.

489
00:28:56,173 --> 00:28:57,473
(chuckles) Hey.

490
00:28:57,575 --> 00:29:01,110
How'd it work out with that
IAD investigation, Lucas?

491
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:03,879
You still carrying a gun?

492
00:29:03,981 --> 00:29:06,148
Anybody say you could drink our coffee?

493
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,916
Is that what this is?

494
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:09,752
Hey, how's it going with that Arab kid?

495
00:29:09,854 --> 00:29:12,254
You sure he's lowlife enough for you?

496
00:29:12,356 --> 00:29:14,323
You know, Raymond, someday
when you got the time,

497
00:29:14,425 --> 00:29:19,495
I'd love you to teach me that choke
hold you used on the Ortega kid.

498
00:29:19,597 --> 00:29:21,830
Raymond: I can show you now if you want.

499
00:29:21,932 --> 00:29:23,732
We can go outside.

500
00:29:29,273 --> 00:29:32,875
(snoring)

501
00:29:37,782 --> 00:29:39,648
Box: Your parents are nice people.

502
00:29:40,518 --> 00:29:41,750
I'm gonna try and expedite,

503
00:29:41,852 --> 00:29:44,653
get that cab back to your
father as soon as possible.

504
00:29:45,623 --> 00:29:47,556
I know how important that is.

505
00:29:47,658 --> 00:29:49,258
We're both working men.

506
00:29:51,462 --> 00:29:54,029
Your lawyer tell you not
to talk to me anymore?

507
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:57,032
Not even casually?

508
00:30:02,106 --> 00:30:04,006
He ask you how it happened?

509
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,909
He didn't?

510
00:30:07,778 --> 00:30:09,078
It doesn't surprise me.

511
00:30:10,448 --> 00:30:12,614
Makes no difference to him,

512
00:30:12,717 --> 00:30:13,782
or to his job.

513
00:30:13,884 --> 00:30:17,286
And you are a job to
him, Naz, make no mistake.

514
00:30:17,388 --> 00:30:19,588
He's gonna make money off this,

515
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,657
your parents' money.

516
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:23,659
The longer it takes, the more he makes.

517
00:30:23,761 --> 00:30:25,728
They can't afford that, can they?

518
00:30:27,498 --> 00:30:29,164
You know where he is right now?

519
00:30:29,266 --> 00:30:33,368
Downstairs drinking coffee with the
detectives, breaking each others' balls.

520
00:30:34,705 --> 00:30:35,938
Because the fact is,

521
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,774
it's a big club, the
criminal justice system.

522
00:30:38,876 --> 00:30:42,111
We can't exist without
each other, and we know it.

523
00:30:42,213 --> 00:30:43,579
But I'm not a member of that club.

524
00:30:43,681 --> 00:30:45,781
I don't like the idea of a double life.

525
00:30:45,883 --> 00:30:47,649
My job is to get to the truth.

526
00:30:47,752 --> 00:30:49,685
So I don't see why I should socialize

527
00:30:49,787 --> 00:30:52,788
with anyone trying to
stop me from doing that.

528
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:55,057
That's why I'm up here with you...

529
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,994
instead of drinking
coffee down there with him.

530
00:31:00,197 --> 00:31:01,563
You shouldn't be doing this, should you?

531
00:31:01,665 --> 00:31:03,766
- What?
- Talking to me without him here.

532
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:07,569
You know, I really love what I do, Naz.

533
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:11,473
But every once in a
while, I get frustrated.

534
00:31:11,575 --> 00:31:13,475
I abide by the rules, though, I do.

535
00:31:13,577 --> 00:31:15,144
So, yeah,

536
00:31:15,246 --> 00:31:18,113
that's right. You don't
have to talk to me...

537
00:31:18,215 --> 00:31:19,815
unless you want to.

538
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,320
You know...

539
00:31:25,422 --> 00:31:28,657
this is the most
open-and-shut case I have had

540
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:30,859
in a very long time.

541
00:31:30,961 --> 00:31:33,962
Everything is pointing to you.

542
00:31:34,064 --> 00:31:36,031
But there's something I'm just not getting.

543
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:38,934
Something I am struggling
with here because...

544
00:31:39,036 --> 00:31:44,072
what I see before me is a nice kid
from a good, hardworking family,

545
00:31:44,175 --> 00:31:46,175
loving mother and father...

546
00:31:47,478 --> 00:31:50,813
on what has got to be
the worst day of his life.

547
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,138
Thank you.

548
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,372
You're welcome.

549
00:32:21,212 --> 00:32:22,778
What am I not seeing, Nasir?

550
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,079
(inhaler hisses)

551
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:28,383
Explain to me what I'm not understanding.

552
00:32:29,687 --> 00:32:31,820
It looks like I killed her, I know that.

553
00:32:31,922 --> 00:32:33,822
Yeah, that's how it looks.

554
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:37,059
But it's not that simple, is it?

555
00:32:39,096 --> 00:32:41,029
Because we both know this isn't you.

556
00:32:41,131 --> 00:32:42,798
You didn't get out of bed yesterday

557
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,634
saying to yourself, "I'm
gonna murder someone tonight."

558
00:32:45,736 --> 00:32:48,637
What you were thinking was "I
hope I pass the economics test.

559
00:32:48,739 --> 00:32:52,407
I hope my mother gets off my
back for this, that, the other."

560
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:54,343
And things just got out of hand.

561
00:32:54,445 --> 00:32:55,944
Sex, drugs, alcohol.

562
00:32:56,046 --> 00:32:58,480
Some girl. You didn't mean
to do it, things happen.

563
00:32:58,582 --> 00:32:59,581
Please stop.

564
00:32:59,683 --> 00:33:02,985
If I'm off, tell me how I'm off.

565
00:33:03,087 --> 00:33:06,188
Help me, help you, Naz. We'll
never get another chance.

566
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,035
You know, there's something
any experienced detective knows,

567
00:33:20,137 --> 00:33:22,771
and it's something I've personally
witnessed hundreds of times

568
00:33:22,873 --> 00:33:24,940
in the last 30 years.

569
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:29,878
Christian, Jew, Muslim, what have you.

570
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,947
There's an immense sense of relief

571
00:33:32,049 --> 00:33:35,450
when they finally just let
go and tell someone the truth.

572
00:33:37,154 --> 00:33:39,254
It's like...

573
00:33:39,356 --> 00:33:40,956
finding God.

574
00:33:56,907 --> 00:33:59,574
I'm not talking to you anymore.

575
00:34:21,718 --> 00:34:23,583
_

576
00:34:27,725 --> 00:34:29,828
_

577
00:34:32,776 --> 00:34:36,712
(rap music playing)

578
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,183
(telephone ringing)

579
00:34:42,386 --> 00:34:44,152
2-1.

580
00:34:44,254 --> 00:34:45,687
Okay.

581
00:34:45,789 --> 00:34:46,955
Transport's here.

582
00:34:58,802 --> 00:35:00,168
Here you go.

583
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,837
Now, put these on.

584
00:35:04,842 --> 00:35:06,842
Stone: Just remember,
don't talk to anybody.

585
00:35:06,944 --> 00:35:09,344
These people, these men and
women, this is their life.

586
00:35:09,446 --> 00:35:11,046
This is what they do every single day.

587
00:35:11,148 --> 00:35:13,949
You're at a massive disadvantage here.

588
00:35:14,051 --> 00:35:15,684
Luckily, you have me.

589
00:35:25,562 --> 00:35:27,763
(police radio chatter)

590
00:35:27,865 --> 00:35:31,233
(distant siren wailing)

591
00:35:40,544 --> 00:35:41,676
(engine starts)

592
00:35:41,779 --> 00:35:45,881
(rap music playing)

593
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:02,898
(thunder rumbling)

594
00:36:11,275 --> 00:36:12,741
(engine starts)

595
00:36:14,111 --> 00:36:18,647

00:36:29,426 --> 00:36:32,327
(rap music playing)

597
00:36:56,904 --> 00:36:59,504
(opera music playing)

598
00:37:07,247 --> 00:37:09,848
(Muzak playing over PA)

599
00:37:15,823 --> 00:37:18,990
(muffled voices arguing)

600
00:37:28,402 --> 00:37:31,670
- _
- (rap music playing)

601
00:37:37,978 --> 00:37:41,780
(woman singing ballad in foreign language)

602
00:37:51,558 --> 00:37:56,294
(rap music playing)

603
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,201
(police radio chatter)

604
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:05,096
Let's go.

605
00:39:14,274 --> 00:39:15,307
Come on.

606
00:39:22,482 --> 00:39:24,616
(thunder rumbling)

607
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:40,131
(door creaks, slams)

608
00:39:41,602 --> 00:39:43,668
(keys jingling)

609
00:39:45,405 --> 00:39:49,808
(distant prisoners shouting)

610
00:40:05,025 --> 00:40:08,593
Man: And dispense with lighters,
matches, cigarettes in the trash.

611
00:40:08,695 --> 00:40:11,863
Whatever else in your
pockets, in the trays.

612
00:40:11,965 --> 00:40:14,299
Anybody still got some weed
or other substance on 'em,

613
00:40:14,401 --> 00:40:17,469
put it in the donation
box. No foul, no harm.

614
00:40:17,571 --> 00:40:19,537
You keep it, it's a new offense.

615
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,473
Is this okay?

616
00:40:26,246 --> 00:40:27,679
You're good. Go.

617
00:40:28,749 --> 00:40:31,583
Come on. Hands up, spread your legs.

618
00:40:31,685 --> 00:40:32,951
All right, turn around.

619
00:40:36,423 --> 00:40:37,756
How is things in Cambridge?

620
00:40:37,858 --> 00:40:39,457
What?

621
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:40,792
This is not mine.

622
00:40:40,894 --> 00:40:41,993
Go ahead.

623
00:40:42,763 --> 00:40:45,230
Hands up. You know the routine.

624
00:40:46,133 --> 00:40:47,699
Turn around. You're good.

625
00:40:47,801 --> 00:40:49,034
Go. Next.

626
00:40:49,136 --> 00:40:50,802
Face the wall. Hands up.

627
00:40:53,206 --> 00:40:55,674
(wand squealing, beeping)

628
00:40:55,776 --> 00:40:57,075
It's a pin in my leg, man.

629
00:40:57,177 --> 00:40:59,511
Yeah, we'll see soon enough. The chair.

630
00:41:00,681 --> 00:41:01,880
Next.

631
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:06,084
You want to take that cell phone
out of your ass, or you want me to?

632
00:41:06,186 --> 00:41:07,152
Next.

633
00:41:07,254 --> 00:41:09,054
Why don't you do it?

634
00:41:09,156 --> 00:41:11,122
Pants down, bend over.

635
00:41:11,224 --> 00:41:12,524
Turn around.

636
00:41:14,127 --> 00:41:15,694
Step to your right. Next.

637
00:41:17,431 --> 00:41:19,597
Face against the wall.
Hands up, spread your legs.

638
00:41:20,567 --> 00:41:21,533
Turn around.

639
00:41:21,635 --> 00:41:22,667
Disposable.

640
00:41:22,769 --> 00:41:24,169
Yeah, I'll say.

641
00:41:24,271 --> 00:41:26,271
Step to your right. Next.

642
00:41:26,373 --> 00:41:27,505
What are you looking at?

643
00:41:30,444 --> 00:41:32,577
Woman: You are waiting arraignment.

644
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:34,479
I'm here every day,

645
00:41:34,581 --> 00:41:37,115
So this is my place, and I like it neat.

646
00:41:38,452 --> 00:41:41,419
You throw up on my floor, you clean it up.

647
00:41:53,967 --> 00:41:55,066
Sweet dreams.

648
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:59,637
(retching)

649
00:42:07,047 --> 00:42:08,813
I need a doctor.

650
00:42:08,915 --> 00:42:10,715
(whimpering)

651
00:42:10,817 --> 00:42:12,484
Man: I'm sick.

652
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:15,754
Somebody...

653
00:42:15,856 --> 00:42:16,921
Shut up.

654
00:42:20,827 --> 00:42:22,827
I'm dying. (cries)

655
00:42:22,929 --> 00:42:23,928
I need help.

656
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,663
(shouts) Shut the fuck up!

657
00:42:28,034 --> 00:42:29,634
(retching)

658
00:42:33,607 --> 00:42:34,773
Man: Please,

659
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:36,407
somebody.

660
00:42:37,878 --> 00:42:38,943
I'm sick.

661
00:42:41,548 --> 00:42:43,214

I'm not doing my report on him.

00:52:19,892 --> 00:52:21,559
Cruz.

832
00:52:21,661 --> 00:52:23,060
Williams.

833
00:52:27,266 --> 00:52:29,233
Bail set at 500.

834
00:52:29,335 --> 00:52:31,402
That's a 100 an 8-ball. Sound fair?

835
00:52:31,504 --> 00:52:35,473
Jimmy, next time, tell your client
to leave his tomahawk at home.

836
00:52:35,575 --> 00:52:37,341
Where'd you have to go for this one?

837
00:52:37,443 --> 00:52:39,076
Paris.

838
00:52:39,178 --> 00:52:40,611
You're kidding me.

839
00:52:40,713 --> 00:52:42,346
Toccoa fucking Georgia.

840
00:52:44,384 --> 00:52:46,016
(indistinct conversation)

841
00:52:46,119 --> 00:52:47,918
Judge: Next.

842
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:51,722
43562, Nasir Khan.

843
00:52:51,824 --> 00:52:53,190
Which one of you is him?

844
00:52:54,527 --> 00:52:55,793
Mm-hmm.

845
00:53:02,268 --> 00:53:03,968
(scanner beeps)

846
00:53:11,811 --> 00:53:13,077
Hey.

847
00:53:13,179 --> 00:53:15,613
You waived the reading of the
rights, but not the rights themselves.

848
00:53:15,715 --> 00:53:17,715
Ah. So waived.

849
00:53:21,687 --> 00:53:22,887
You're Mr. Khan?

850
00:53:22,989 --> 00:53:24,054
Yes, sir.

851
00:53:24,857 --> 00:53:26,223
Well, according to the complaint,

852
00:53:26,325 --> 00:53:28,592
you're charged with possession of a weapon,

853
00:53:28,694 --> 00:53:30,761
possession of a weapon for deadly purpose,

854
00:53:30,863 --> 00:53:32,396
resisting arrest,

855
00:53:32,498 --> 00:53:34,298
aggravated sexual assault,

856
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,034
and murder in the first degree.

857
00:53:37,136 --> 00:53:38,068
Fuck me.

858
00:53:38,171 --> 00:53:39,403
How do you plead?

859
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,206
I didn't do it.

860
00:53:42,308 --> 00:53:45,476
Mr. Khan, this court is
kind of like "Jeopardy."

861
00:53:45,578 --> 00:53:46,944
I ask a question,

862
00:53:47,046 --> 00:53:49,313
the answer has to be in the right phrasing.

863
00:53:49,415 --> 00:53:52,516
He means to say "not guilty," Your Honor.

864
00:53:52,618 --> 00:53:54,552
Is that what you mean to say, Mr. Khan?

865
00:53:54,654 --> 00:53:56,120
Yes.

866
00:53:57,323 --> 00:53:58,489
Can you say it?

867
00:53:59,492 --> 00:54:00,624
Not guilty.

868
00:54:00,726 --> 00:54:02,159
Thank you.

869
00:54:02,261 --> 00:54:04,061
Your Honor, if we can be heard on bail.

870
00:54:04,163 --> 00:54:06,697
The defendant has extensive
family roots in Pakistan,

871
00:54:06,799 --> 00:54:09,967
and given the fact he's charged with
murder based on overwhelming evidence,

872
00:54:10,069 --> 00:54:11,735
and facing a sentence of life,

873
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:14,939
we consider him a serious
flight risk and request remand.

874
00:54:15,041 --> 00:54:16,040
John?

875
00:54:16,142 --> 00:54:19,176
Your Honor, my client
was born in this country.

876
00:54:19,278 --> 00:54:21,879
Whatever so-called
roots he has in Pakistan,

877
00:54:21,981 --> 00:54:25,082
he's got far deeper roots in
his community here in Queens.

878
00:54:25,184 --> 00:54:27,318
In fact, he's never been to Pakistan

879
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,720
or anywhere else outside
New York State in his life.

880
00:54:29,822 --> 00:54:32,990
He's a young man from a
solid working-class family.

881
00:54:33,092 --> 00:54:34,892
A college student, no priors.

882
00:54:34,994 --> 00:54:38,529
He's not a danger to himself
or others, and is, in fact,

883
00:54:38,631 --> 00:54:41,599
desperate to prove his
innocence in a courtroom,

884
00:54:41,701 --> 00:54:43,934
and so not a flight risk.

885
00:54:44,036 --> 00:54:47,171
And despite the DA's
confidence in the evidence,

886
00:54:47,273 --> 00:54:49,139
there are no witnesses to the actual crime.

887
00:54:49,242 --> 00:54:52,510
Which is to say, the evidence
against him is purely circumstantial.

888
00:54:52,612 --> 00:54:54,378
It's not purely circumstantial, Your Honor,

889
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,847
All of which is to say, we request a bail

890
00:54:56,949 --> 00:54:59,283
commensurate with his
family's ability to raise it.

891
00:54:59,385 --> 00:55:01,852
Your Honor, this was a
particularly vicious crime.

892
00:55:01,954 --> 00:55:04,688
CJA, Your Honor, recommends ROR.

893
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:06,390
I don't care what CJA says.

894
00:55:06,492 --> 00:55:09,126
It's a waste of taxpayer's money, honestly.

895
00:55:09,228 --> 00:55:13,297
Now you both know I usually like
to split the baby in terms of bail,

896
00:55:13,399 --> 00:55:17,768
but I'm going with Mr. McPherson on this
one due to the severity of the charges.

897
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:20,671
That's all they are, Your
Honor, charges. Not facts.

898
00:55:20,773 --> 00:55:23,507
You can take it up at a later
date if the circumstances change,

899
00:55:23,609 --> 00:55:25,409
but I'm denying bail.

900
00:55:25,511 --> 00:55:28,679
Your client's hereby
remanded to await prosecution.

901
00:55:30,149 --> 00:55:31,215
Don't talk to anybody.

902
00:55:31,317 --> 00:55:32,850
Where am I going?

903
00:55:32,952 --> 00:55:34,285
John.

904
00:55:34,387 --> 00:55:38,556
Just curious. Friend of the
family, or right place, right time?

905
00:55:38,658 --> 00:55:40,224
Right place, right time.

906
00:55:40,326 --> 00:55:41,892
Right place, right time. Good for you.

907
00:55:42,929 --> 00:55:44,495
Yeah.

908
00:55:44,597 --> 00:55:45,629
Next.

909
00:55:46,632 --> 00:55:50,367
Bailiff: 43563, Hightower.

910
00:55:50,469 --> 00:55:52,937
That's what I expected, okay?

911
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:54,939
Judge: Mr. Hightower, we meet again.

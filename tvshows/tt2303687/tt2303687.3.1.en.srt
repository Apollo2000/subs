Hari. Hari, mate, he's down.

He refused to surrender
his firearm.

85
00:04:40,612 --> 00:04:42,614
Jesus Christ,
look where the gun is!

86
00:04:42,652 --> 00:04:45,258
- How'd it get over there?
- Muscle spasm, he chucked it.

87
00:04:45,292 --> 00:04:47,294
Look at what it looks like,
though, Danny.

88
00:04:47,332 --> 00:04:49,380
Good point.

89
00:04:49,412 --> 00:04:52,621
- Hey, hey, Danny, Danny.
- It was self-defence.

90
00:04:53,532 --> 00:04:55,580
But we all know
the shit I'll get for it.

You're making it worse.

I don't want to see you lot

- Us'?
- We didn't do nothing.

95
00:05:02,532 --> 00:05:04,455
That's the problem.
So I'll cover for you

96
00:05:04,492 --> 00:05:06,813
and say we got here together,
shouted, "Armed police!"

97
00:05:06,852 --> 00:05:09,059
- but he pulled a gun.
- What are you talking about?

98
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:11,572
He would have surrendered
if you'd got here in time.

99
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:14,297
That's my report unless
the lot of you man up right now.

100
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:17,536
Discharge your weapons.

101
00:05:17,572 --> 00:05:19,700
- No way.
- Shoot over the suspect's body

102
00:05:19,732 --> 00:05:21,496
in the direction
you'd have fired

to get here in time.

requesting forensic deployment
for the scene.

119
00:06:28,252 --> 00:06:31,142
All AFOs and weapons require
transporting to base

120
00:06:31,172 --> 00:06:34,255
for forensic recovery
of evidence and debrief.

121
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:36,294
- You're sure you're OK'?
- Fine.

122
00:06:37,252 --> 00:06:39,254
Everyone did their job.

123
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:43,578
Sir.

124
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,023
- Carry on.
- Sir.

125
00:06:45,052 --> 00:06:46,656
Carry on.

126
00:06:49,212 --> 00:06:50,702
Sir.

127
00:06:50,732 --> 00:06:52,222
Steve?

128
00:06:54,172 --> 00:06:56,982
What do you reckon, son'?
One for us'?

129
00:07:03,772 --> 00:07:06,378
Yeah. One for us.

130
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:14,656
Sir.

131
00:07:14,692 --> 00:07:16,296
As you were.

132
00:07:16,332 --> 00:07:18,300
Forensics will take
your firearms,

133
00:07:18,332 --> 00:07:21,256
gunshot residue samples,
clothing, nail scrapings.

134
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:24,421
You are to remain at the station
until they advise they don't

135
00:07:24,452 --> 00:07:26,181
- need any further samples.
- Sir.

136
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,738
You're all entitled to 48 hours'
recovery time.

137
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:31,537
You'll all be offered
post-traumatic counselling.

138
00:07:31,572 --> 00:07:34,178
My advice is to use
these 48 hours wisely.

139
00:07:34,212 --> 00:07:35,418
Sir.

140

153
00:08:29,492 --> 00:08:32,939
as to how you personally became
involved in Operation Dams-an?

154
00:08:34,252 --> 00:08:37,256
It was a real-time deployment
authorised by the SFC.

00:08:51,772 --> 00:08:54,901
exit routes for the suspect
and maintained radio contact

163
00:08:54,932 --> 00:08:56,934
with the operational senior APO.

164
00:08:56,972 --> 00:08:59,293
Please confirm
this was an inspector using

165
00:08:59,332 --> 00:09:01,141
the call sign Victor Charlie
Four One.

166
00:09:01,172 --> 00:09:04,176
Correct. Victor Charlie Four One
notified me that the suspect was

167
00:09:04,212 --> 00:09:06,101
travelling towards us
and authorised us

168
00:09:06,132 --> 00:09:07,816
to carry out
a real-time intercept.

169
00:09:07,852 --> 00:09:09,536
A real-time intercept, yeah.

170
00:09:09,572 --> 00:09:13,782
Things get a wee bit fuzzy...
for me here, Sergeant.

171
00:09:13,812 --> 00:09:17,817
Maybe you could be a ray of
sunshine and burn off the fog.

172
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,894
Hm'?

173
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,936
I'm waiting.

174
00:09:27,972 --> 00:09:29,701
Sir, I'm waiting for a question.

175
00:09:29,732 --> 00:09:33,259
What the Super's asking you is
how come, as per the statement

176
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:34,896
given by Victor Charlie
Four One,

177
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:37,060
you were ordered
to wait for support

178
00:09:37,092 --> 00:09:38,617
Not ordered. Advised.

179
00:09:38,652 --> 00:09:41,383
But you went ahead and carried
out the hard-stop anyway.

180
00:09:41,412 --> 00:09:43,301
The suspect was travelling
at high speed

181
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:46,063
to an unknown destination
with the intention of committing

182
00:09:46,092 --> 00:09:48,572
- a gangland execution.
- Or so the intelligence said.

183
00:09:48,612 --> 00:09:50,979
The intelligence did say
and, if that's wrong, sir,

184
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:52,776
well, take it up with them.

185
00:09:52,812 --> 00:09:55,179
Can we please just stick to
a line of questioning

186
00:09:55,212 --> 00:09:57,579
that relates to Victor Charlie
Five One's actions?

187
00:09:57,612 --> 00:09:59,216
On you go, Sergeant.

188
00:09:59,252 --> 00:10:02,256
It'll help if I refer to the map
in our folders.

189
00:10:03,332 --> 00:10:04,936
Document 4.

190
00:10:07,492 --> 00:10:10,974
Travelling at high speed along
Prince's Road, the suspect

191
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:14,221
approached a line of parked cars
with open road ahead.

192
00:10:14,252 --> 00:10:16,414
I was concerned if we didn't
carry out the hard stop

193
00:10:16,452 --> 00:10:17,692
the suspect would get away.

194
00:10:17,732 --> 00:10:19,734
Oh, and that was your decision,
was it'?

195
00:10:19,772 --> 00:10:23,219
No, sir. It was the decision of
the Strategic Firearms Commander

196
00:10:23,252 --> 00:10:26,017
who designated the operational
objective of preventing

197
00:10:26,052 --> 00:10:28,373
the suspect carrying out
an act of lethal force.

198
00:10:28,412 --> 00:10:30,062
Added to which,
as police officers,

199
00:10:30,092 --> 00:10:32,982
it's a non-negotiable duty
to protect the public.

200
00:10:33,012 --> 00:10:35,014
May I answer the question now?

201
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:37,100
HASTINGS: Please do.

202
00:10:37,132 --> 00:10:38,816
Fearing the suspect
would get away

203
00:10:38,852 --> 00:10:40,854
and pose a danger to the public,

204
00:10:40,892 --> 00:10:43,577
I took the decision to close off
his route of escape by

205
00:10:43,612 --> 00:10:46,695
executing a hard-stop manoeuvre
on Prince's Road that trapped

206
00:10:46,732 --> 00:10:49,383
the suspects vehicle between
ours and the parked cars.

207
00:10:49,412 --> 00:10:52,097
The suspect then
made his escape on foot

208
00:10:52,132 --> 00:10:54,134
via an alleyway
and I gave chase.

209
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:57,901
This foot chase led to a
confrontation in Prince's Court.

210
00:10:57,932 --> 00:11:00,697
We need you to tell us
all about this confrontation.

211
00:11:00,732 --> 00:11:03,338
Once in Prince's Court,
almost immediately,

212
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:05,215
the suspect realised
he was cornered.

213
00:11:05,252 --> 00:11:09,496
The suspect turned his weapon on
us and fired. We returned fire.

214
00:11:09,532 --> 00:11:13,218
Shots struck the suspect in the
head and proved instantly fatal.

215
00:11:13,252 --> 00:11:15,573
We've received written
statements from yourself

216
00:11:15,612 --> 00:11:17,023
and the other AFOs on your team.

217
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:20,056
Said statements agree you all
entered Prince's Court together.

218
00:11:20,092 --> 00:11:21,503
Correct.

219
00:11:21,532 --> 00:11:23,136
See, the thing is,

220
00:11:23,172 --> 00:11:26,858
we've got a statement off of
an eyewitness on Prince's Road.

221
00:11:26,892 --> 00:11:28,940
Says that you entered
that rough ground

222
00:11:28,972 --> 00:11:31,179
at least 30 seconds before
the rest of your team.

223
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:34,102
I was first out of our vehicle.
That misled the eyewitness.

224
00:11:34,132 --> 00:11:35,736
You're saying she's mistaken?

225
00:11:35,772 --> 00:11:38,901
My written statement and those
of my team are accurate.

226
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,377
Yes, they are.

227
00:11:40,412 --> 00:11:44,576
And entirely consistent
in every detail.

228
00:11:46,892 --> 00:11:48,894
You and your team,
you acted as one'?

229
00:11:48,932 --> 00:11:50,343
Correct.

230
00:11:50,372 --> 00:11:53,740
Not always the case with you
and your teams, though, is it?

231
00:11:53,772 --> 00:11:56,378
In your four years at South
Ferry, there's been transfer

232
00:11:56,412 --> 00:11:59,063
<i>requests from officers who
didn't want to be in your team.</i>

233
00:11:59,092 --> 00:12:01,094
WALDRON: Some guys can't cut it.

234
00:12:01,132 --> 00:12:02,896
<i>I want them off my squad.</i>

235
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:05,663
<i>To save face, they put in
for a transfer request.</i>

236
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:08,457
ARNOTT: None of these officers
had a problem with you?

237
00:12:08,492 --> 00:12:10,301
I've got high standards.

238
00:12:11,812 --> 00:12:13,416
That's their problem.

239
00:12:14,812 --> 00:12:16,974
Se, you all entered
Prince's Court together?

240
00:12:17,012 --> 00:12:18,616
Yes, sir.

241
00:12:18,652 --> 00:12:20,416
We were moving fast on foot,

242
00:12:20,452 --> 00:12:22,580
but I carried out
a rapid risk assessment,

243
00:12:22,612 --> 00:12:25,616
noting no members of the public
were in immediate jeopardy.

244
00:12:25,652 --> 00:12:27,814
I called, "Armed police!"

245
00:12:27,852 --> 00:12:30,776
The suspect turned his weapon
on us and opened fire.

246
00:12:30,812 --> 00:12:32,302
I returned fire.

247
00:12:32,332 --> 00:12:34,061
The suspect fell to the ground.

248
00:12:34,092 --> 00:12:36,299
Immediate examination
of the suspect

249
00:12:36,332 --> 00:12:38,061
by Victor Charlie Five Four

250
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:40,220
revealed serious wounds
to the head.

251
00:12:40,252 --> 00:12:42,334
The suspect had
absent respiration

252
00:12:42,372 --> 00:12:44,374
and his pulse was also absent.

253
00:12:44,412 --> 00:12:46,540
I secured his firearm.
A few moments later,

254
00:12:46,572 --> 00:12:48,654
Victor Charlie Four One
arrived on the scene

255
00:12:48,692 --> 00:12:51,263
with her team and assumed
operational command.

256
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:53,579
You discharged your pistols,
not your 636s'?

257
00:12:53,612 --> 00:12:56,343
We confronted the suspect
in a confined space,

258
00:12:56,372 --> 00:12:57,942
bounded by hard surfaces.

259
00:12:57,972 --> 00:13:00,896
Given the G36 has
a muzzle velocity of over 900

260
00:13:00,932 --> 00:13:04,379
metres per second, I identified
a significant risk our rounds

261
00:13:04,412 --> 00:13:06,141
might pass through the suspect

262
00:13:06,172 --> 00:13:08,379
and ricochet back at us,
causing injury.

263
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,813
We don't have an eyewitness
to the shooting.

264
00:13:10,852 --> 00:13:14,220
- But we've three ear-witnesses.
- Three independent witnesses.

265
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:17,096
Each ear-witness claims to have
heard a group of gunshots,

266
00:13:17,132 --> 00:13:20,341
followed closely by what sounded
like a second group of gunshots,

267
00:13:20,372 --> 00:13:22,579
followed closely by
a single gunshot.

268
00:13:23,972 --> 00:13:26,782
As per my written statement,
it's a matter of fact

269
00:13:26,812 --> 00:13:29,782
that there was one shot fired by
the suspect, immediately

270
00:13:29,812 --> 00:13:33,021
followed by a group of shots
fired simultaneously by myself,

271
00:13:33,052 --> 00:13:36,135
Victor Charlie Five Two
and Victor Charlie Five Three.

272
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:38,379
These independent ear-witnesses

273
00:13:38,412 --> 00:13:40,494
would seem to contradict
said fact.

274
00:13:40,532 --> 00:13:43,263
It's an accepted
and well-recognised acoustic

275
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:46,023
phenomenon that an ear-witness
can be deceived by up to six

276
00:13:46,052 --> 00:13:48,817
different sounds associated with
a single gunshot.

277
00:13:48,852 --> 00:13:50,741
Document 6 in your folders.

278
00:13:52,212 --> 00:13:55,022
The forensic report regarding
Operation Damson.

279
00:13:55,052 --> 00:13:58,056
Gunshot residue from the
discharge of a Glock 17 pistol

280
00:13:58,092 --> 00:14:01,096
was detected on the hands
and clothing of the following.

281
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,941
Victor Charlie Five One,

282
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:06,101
Victor Charlie Five Two
and Victor Charlie Five Three.

283
00:14:06,132 --> 00:14:07,896
They all discharged
their weapons.

284
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:09,422
No-one's disputing that.

285
00:14:09,452 --> 00:14:12,774
A Colt 1911 A1 pistol was found
in the suspect's right hand.

286
00:14:12,812 --> 00:14:15,497
Gunshot residue from
the discharge of this firearm

287
00:14:15,532 --> 00:14:17,057
was detected on the suspect.

288
00:14:17,092 --> 00:14:19,663
Gunshot residue from the Colt
was also detected

289
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,501
on Victor Charlie Five One.

290
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:27,898
Are you able to explain
this finding,

291
00:14:27,932 --> 00:14:29,934
<i>Victor Charlie Five One?</i>

292
00:14:29,972 --> 00:14:33,340
<i>I secured the suspects firearm,
causing secondary transfer</i>

293
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,818
<i>of residue after the firearm
had been discharged.</i>

294
00:14:35,852 --> 00:14:38,537
This explains the high
concentration of residue.

295
00:14:38,572 --> 00:14:39,983
Does it'?

296
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:43,255
Concentration and distribution
are characteristic of a gunman.

297
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:46,296
- Caused when I secured the gun.
- You expect us to believe that'?

298
00:14:46,332 --> 00:14:49,142
At a distance of approximately
five metres from the suspect,

299
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:52,062
there was a concentration of
gunshot residue on the ground.

300
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:54,902
Said gunshot residue matched
the suspect's firearm.

301
00:14:54,932 --> 00:14:56,661
How do you account for this'?

302
00:14:56,692 --> 00:14:59,696
The suspect was in motion
as he turned towards my team.

303
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,336
He covered a short distance

304
00:15:01,372 --> 00:15:03,261
between raising the gun
and firing it.

305
00:15:03,292 --> 00:15:05,977
Gunshot residue is on the ground
where the body was found.

306
00:15:06,012 --> 00:15:07,423
That's where he fired the gun.

307
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:09,773
Why is there residue
five metres away, as well'?

308
00:15:09,812 --> 00:15:11,177
He has answered the question.

309
00:15:11,212 --> 00:15:12,976
Did the gun
ever lie in a position

310
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,094
on the ground,
five metres from the suspect?

311
00:15:15,132 --> 00:15:17,134
No, it did not.

312
00:15:20,412 --> 00:15:22,016
HASTINGS: Steve?

313
00:15:24,932 --> 00:15:26,741
Document 11.

314
00:15:26,772 --> 00:15:30,299
The postmortem result.
Three bullets were recovered

315
00:15:30,332 --> 00:15:33,620
from the head wounds and were
identified as 9 X 19 millimetre

316
00:15:33,652 --> 00:15:36,383
Parabellum rounds
fired by a Glock 17 pistol

317
00:15:36,412 --> 00:15:40,019
issued to Authorised Firearms
Officer Victor Charlie Five One.

318
00:15:40,052 --> 00:15:44,057
Three shots. Oh, you made sure,
didn't you, Sergeant?

319
00:15:45,172 --> 00:15:47,857
Victor Charlie Five One
regrets the loss of life,

320
00:15:47,892 --> 00:15:49,894
but I don't need
to remind everyone

321
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:53,414
that he was an Authorised
Firearms Officer acting on

322
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,376
the lawful orders of
a Strategic Firearms Commander.

323
00:15:56,412 --> 00:15:57,982
- You regret killing him'?
- I've said...

324
00:15:58,012 --> 00:16:00,094
I'm asking
Victor Charlie Five One.

325
00:16:00,132 --> 00:16:02,738
Victor Charlie Five One
has the right to be interviewed

326
00:16:02,772 --> 00:16:04,774
by an officer
at least one rank superior.

327
00:16:05,852 --> 00:16:10,062
Do you regret killing him,
Victor Charlie Five One'?

328
00:16:10,092 --> 00:16:11,935
I regret the loss of life.

329
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:14,976
- Three shots, fella!
- Standard practice is to aim at

330
00:16:15,012 --> 00:16:16,582
the maximum body mass -
the chest.

331
00:16:16,612 --> 00:16:18,660
- Why head shots?
- I was ten metres away

332
00:16:18,692 --> 00:16:21,093
in good visibility,
the shots were achievable.

333
00:16:21,132 --> 00:16:23,294
Standard practice
is double-tap the trigger.

334
00:16:23,332 --> 00:16:25,619
- Discharging shots in pairs.
- Not two, not four.

335
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,700
He collapsed after the third
so I ceased fire.

336
00:16:27,732 --> 00:16:29,541
Yeah, right.
Shot him down like a dog.

337
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:32,018
- Your language is inflammatory.
- Yeah.

338
00:16:32,052 --> 00:16:33,816
<i>ARNOTT. You'd prefer
to have wounded him?</i>

339
00:16:33,852 --> 00:16:35,422
WALDRON:
We don't shoot to <i>wound.</i>

340
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,454
<i>We shoot to neutralise
the lethal threat.</i>

341
00:16:37,492 --> 00:16:39,540
You were the only APO
to strike the target.

342
00:16:39,572 --> 00:16:42,098
- Yes, that's what happened.
- Listen to me, son.

343
00:16:42,132 --> 00:16:45,500
We weren't born yesterday. You
shot that fella in cold blood

344
00:16:45,532 --> 00:16:47,899
while your wee mates
stood by and watched.

345
00:16:47,932 --> 00:16:50,219
I shot first, the others
fired a fraction later,

346
00:16:50,252 --> 00:16:52,858
by which time the suspect had
collapsed and they missed.

347
00:16:52,892 --> 00:16:54,894
You saw all that
in a fraction of a second?

348
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:57,253
I've never been to
this building before.

349
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:59,579
You saw me walk into
this interview room

350
00:16:59,612 --> 00:17:01,899
and sit down
in a matter of a few seconds.

351
00:17:03,532 --> 00:17:06,661
Over my left shoulder are
three rows of open-plan desks

352
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,262
in front of a glass partition

353
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:11,216
dividing the open-plan area
from a private office.

354
00:17:11,252 --> 00:17:12,742
Range 20 metres.

355
00:17:12,772 --> 00:17:14,979
Seated at the desks
are seven personnel,

356
00:17:15,012 --> 00:17:17,253
comprising four males
and three females.

357
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:19,693
Over my right shoulder
is a longitudinal partition

358
00:17:19,732 --> 00:17:22,497
at chest height, beyond which
is gate-controlled access.

359
00:17:22,532 --> 00:17:23,863
Range 20 metres.

360
00:17:23,892 --> 00:17:26,702
Entrance and exit to this floor
are via key-controlled lifts

361
00:17:26,732 --> 00:17:29,383
adjacent to the waiting area
at my four o'clock position.

362
00:17:29,412 --> 00:17:30,743
Range 35 metres.

363
00:17:30,772 --> 00:17:32,262
Why the second shot'?

364
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:34,374
- Why the third?
- The first shot was fatal.

365
00:17:34,412 --> 00:17:36,221
Why did you keep firing'?

366
00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:38,141
Were you losing it out there,
fella?

367
00:17:38,172 --> 00:17:40,937
I cite under common law
my lawful right to use

368
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:43,100
"lethal force
for preservation of life

369
00:17:43,132 --> 00:17:45,942
or in self-defence
where this threat is immediate."

370
00:17:45,972 --> 00:17:49,055
Yes. In response, I cite Section
117 of the Police and Criminal

371
00:17:49,092 --> 00:17:51,572
Evidence Act, the use of
"reasonable force" and,

372
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:55,333
for the tape, the emphasis is
mine, not contained in the Act.

373
00:17:55,372 --> 00:17:57,773
That's an easy argument
from behind a desk, sir.

374
00:17:57,812 --> 00:18:00,941
From behind this desk, Sergeant,
we uphold standards.

375
00:18:02,012 --> 00:18:04,014
Standards
you're expected to meet

376
00:18:04,052 --> 00:18:06,054
as a serving police officer.

377
00:18:10,932 --> 00:18:13,663
Do you recognise
the man in this image'?

378
00:18:14,652 --> 00:18:16,814
I object in the strongest
possible terms.

379
00:18:16,852 --> 00:18:20,698
Victor Charlie Five One's been
involved in an extremely tragic

380
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,336
and distressing incident

381
00:18:22,372 --> 00:18:25,660
and this line of inquiry is
offensive and insensitive.

382
00:18:25,692 --> 00:18:29,902
Your man doesn't strike me
as the, er, sensitive type.

383
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,858
Are you?

384
00:18:33,932 --> 00:18:35,457
Am I what'?

385
00:18:36,252 --> 00:18:37,902
Sensitive.

386
00:18:38,972 --> 00:18:42,181
<i>On your personnel file,
there's no recorded next of kin.</i>

387
00:18:43,252 --> 00:18:44,617
<i>Wife?</i>

388
00:18:44,652 --> 00:18:46,097
<i>Fiancée?</i>

389
00:18:46,132 --> 00:18:48,942
This line of questioning has
no bearing on the investigation.

390
00:18:48,972 --> 00:18:50,736
We don't know that yet.

391
00:18:50,772 --> 00:18:52,376
I'm single.

392
00:18:58,852 --> 00:19:00,854
The suspect was
an armed criminal

393
00:19:00,892 --> 00:19:02,496
with a history of violence,

394
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:05,661
posing an immediate and credible
threat to the public.

395
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:10,221
In respect of Operation Damson,
on May 13th,

396
00:19:10,252 --> 00:19:14,052
the Strategic Firearms Commander
authorised the use of firearms.

397
00:19:14,092 --> 00:19:18,575
Under Section 3 of the Criminal
Law Act 1967, I am also

398
00:19:18,612 --> 00:19:21,900
entitled to use such force as is
reasonable in the circumstances

399
00:19:21,932 --> 00:19:24,139
to prevent crime
and, under Section 117

400
00:19:24,172 --> 00:19:26,857
of the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984,

401
00:19:26,892 --> 00:19:29,020
I am entitled to use
reasonable force

402
00:19:29,052 --> 00:19:31,054
in the exercise of
police powers.

403
00:19:31,092 --> 00:19:34,221
Under Common Law, I have the
lawful right to use lethal force

404
00:19:34,252 --> 00:19:36,573
for preservation of life
or in self-defence

405
00:19:36,612 --> 00:19:38,296
where this threat is immediate.

406
00:19:38,332 --> 00:19:40,858
At no time has anyone
in this room put forward

407
00:19:40,892 --> 00:19:43,372
credible evidence
that I acted unlawfully

408
00:19:43,412 --> 00:19:45,983
and, therefore, I formally
request that my withdrawal

409
00:19:46,012 --> 00:19:49,221
from operational deployment
be lifted and my firearms permit

410
00:19:49,252 --> 00:19:52,335
be reinstated, so I can get back
to doing what I do best.

411
00:19:53,772 --> 00:19:56,252
This investigation
is far from over, son.

412
00:19:57,252 --> 00:20:00,734
As far as I'm concerned, we've
only just scratched the surface.

413
00:20:00,772 --> 00:20:03,059
<i>Requests denied.
Interview terminated.</i>

414
00:20:03,092 --> 00:20:05,094
(Glass wall muffles speech)

415
00:20:06,052 --> 00:20:08,054
Desk duty only.

416
00:20:23,772 --> 00:20:25,262
(Presses button)

417
00:20:28,052 --> 00:20:30,054
Danny, don't do this.

418
00:20:30,092 --> 00:20:32,743
What was that'? My personal life'?
What was that'?

419
00:20:32,772 --> 00:20:34,695
- Nothing personal.
- No'?

420
00:20:34,732 --> 00:20:36,939
- Interviews finished, Danny.
- I'm not.

421
00:20:36,972 --> 00:20:39,578
Good. Neither are we.

422
00:21:41,372 --> 00:21:43,374
WOMAN:
There isn't a bomb under it.

423
00:21:44,452 --> 00:21:46,341
But there ought to be.

424
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:50,894
Fortunately, I booked a table.

425
00:21:50,932 --> 00:21:53,060
Somewhere
ridiculously expensive.

426
00:21:53,092 --> 00:21:55,094
Well, I guess I had that coming.

427
00:21:55,132 --> 00:21:57,134
I'm so sorry, I forgot...

428
00:21:59,132 --> 00:22:00,736
All right.

429
00:22:00,772 --> 00:22:02,581
Then what am I...

430
00:22:04,052 --> 00:22:06,054
supposed to do with these?

431
00:22:07,132 --> 00:22:08,816
Happy anniversary.

432
00:23:03,252 --> 00:23:05,778
- (Bell rings)
- Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

433
00:23:05,812 --> 00:23:07,894
Victor Charlie Two Zero,
on our way.

434
00:23:07,932 --> 00:23:10,617
McANDREW: Victor Charlie
Two Zero, received.

435
00:23:11,612 --> 00:23:13,819
(Engines start)

436
00:23:15,652 --> 00:23:18,337
(Bell continues ringing)

437
00:23:18,372 --> 00:23:20,374
- (Phone rings nearby)
- (Sighs)

438
00:23:54,492 --> 00:23:56,654
It's all right, mate.
You leave it to us. Yeah'?

439
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:07,741
Oi.

440
00:24:10,692 --> 00:24:13,263
Are you gonna tell us
how it went with AC-12?

441
00:24:14,652 --> 00:24:17,417
- You first.
- We stuck to the story, mate.

442
00:24:17,452 --> 00:24:19,500
Like you gave us
much of a choice.

443
00:24:19,532 --> 00:24:21,853
So we all stuck to the story.

444
00:24:21,892 --> 00:24:23,894
(Door opens)

445
00:24:23,932 --> 00:24:25,661
- All right'?
- All right.

446
00:24:30,332 --> 00:24:33,859
They'll go through the motions,
hit a brick wall. Case closed.

447
00:24:33,892 --> 00:24:36,372
- You want us to play along'?
- It's worked so far.

448
00:24:36,412 --> 00:24:38,540
- So far'?
- What's your problem'?

449
00:24:39,692 --> 00:24:41,296
My problem...

450
00:24:41,332 --> 00:24:43,334
(Voices in background)

451
00:24:44,092 --> 00:24:45,981
My problem...

452
00:24:46,012 --> 00:24:48,902
is what really happened
with you and that suspect.

453
00:24:51,972 --> 00:24:53,974
Don't try playing the big man.

454
00:24:55,172 --> 00:24:57,174
We both know
you're not up to it.

455
00:24:59,452 --> 00:25:01,261
She definitely does.

456
00:25:10,252 --> 00:25:12,254
<i>Muffled speech</i>

457
00:25:12,292 --> 00:25:14,294
(Laughter)

458
00:25:18,932 --> 00:25:21,856
(Knocks) All right to come in
with the gaffer for a minute'?

459
00:25:21,892 --> 00:25:23,701
Sure.

460
00:25:27,732 --> 00:25:29,541
Kate, thanks.

461
00:25:29,572 --> 00:25:32,576
We're just discussing
the Daniel Waldron shooting.

462
00:25:32,612 --> 00:25:34,694
Is there an undercover
assignment?

463
00:25:34,732 --> 00:25:37,303
Look, can I just say,
this feels like a long shot'?

464
00:25:37,332 --> 00:25:39,539
Kate was kept out of
the interview on purpose

465
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:41,654
to give us this option.
We should use it.

466
00:25:41,692 --> 00:25:43,774
Remind me, Kate.
Are you firearms trained'?

467
00:25:43,812 --> 00:25:45,462
Yes, sir, I am.

468
00:25:45,492 --> 00:25:47,494
The statements
given by Waldron's team

469
00:25:47,532 --> 00:25:50,536
are all highly consistent,
that's not suspicious in itself,

470
00:25:50,572 --> 00:25:52,893
given 48 hours
to get their stories straight.

471
00:25:52,932 --> 00:25:55,253
The question is whether
Waldron's story adds up

472
00:25:55,292 --> 00:25:57,863
and whether his squad is really
as loyal as they appear.

473
00:25:57,892 --> 00:26:00,372
The only way to know
is with Kate on the case.

474
00:26:00,412 --> 00:26:03,222
Putting Kate into an AFO role
is a whole level efjeepardy

475
00:26:03,252 --> 00:26:06,381
- above a normal undercover...
- I can handle it.

476
00:26:06,412 --> 00:26:08,574
(Music and chatter)

477
00:26:08,612 --> 00:26:12,094
It's kind of a regular thing.
First Wednesday of every month.

478
00:26:12,132 --> 00:26:14,260
You all right'?
Lets off a bit of steam.

479
00:26:14,292 --> 00:26:16,294
- I'm in.
- What can I get you'?

480
00:26:16,332 --> 00:26:18,858
- Oh, no. My shout, guv.
- ls the right answer.

481
00:26:18,892 --> 00:26:21,213
- Vodka and tonic. A big one.
- Coming up.

482
00:26:21,252 --> 00:26:23,016
The New APO.

483
00:26:23,052 --> 00:26:24,463
Kate...?

484
00:26:24,492 --> 00:26:26,096
Kate Francis.

485
00:26:26,132 --> 00:26:27,372
All right'?

486
00:26:27,412 --> 00:26:30,018
- All right for a drink'?
- Yeah. Got one here. Thanks.

487
00:26:30,052 --> 00:26:31,941
Got off lightly. Nice one.

488
00:26:33,772 --> 00:26:35,422
You've got to be kidding me.

489
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:46,621
All right'?

490
00:26:50,932 --> 00:26:52,343
Relax, mate. Off duty.

491
00:26:52,372 --> 00:26:54,022
You don't do
the monthly piss-up.

492
00:26:54,052 --> 00:26:56,020
A bit of bonding
felt like a good idea.

493
00:26:56,852 --> 00:26:58,661
No-one gonna buy me a drink'?

494
00:26:58,692 --> 00:27:01,536
- What are you having, skipper?
- Mineral water.

495
00:27:01,572 --> 00:27:03,142
Still.

496
00:27:04,212 --> 00:27:05,498
Ta.

497
00:27:20,212 --> 00:27:22,499
How are you doing, then'?
You all right'?

498
00:27:22,532 --> 00:27:23,818
Fine.

499
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:25,502
You'?

500
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:28,574
Yeah, I'm good, yeah.

501
00:27:31,372 --> 00:27:34,296
I think I'd best give Jackie
a hand with them drinks.

502
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:41,576
McANDREW: Danny.

503
00:27:41,612 --> 00:27:43,216
Evening, ma'am.

504
00:27:43,252 --> 00:27:44,822
Meet Kate Francis.

505
00:27:44,852 --> 00:27:47,059
- Kate, Danny Waldron.
- Are you all right'?

506
00:27:47,092 --> 00:27:50,221
- How are you doing'?
- Thanks for the drink, Kate.

507
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:52,334
- That's all right.
- See you in a bit.

508
00:27:56,452 --> 00:27:59,183
- You're new, then'?
- Yeah, I got posted while...

509
00:27:59,212 --> 00:28:01,214
While I've been chained
to a desk.

510
00:28:01,252 --> 00:28:03,983
Sorry. They give you
the firepower, but when you

511
00:28:04,012 --> 00:28:06,697
actually do what's necessary,
suddenly you're a pariah.

512
00:28:08,692 --> 00:28:10,501
Where are you posted from'?

513
00:28:10,532 --> 00:28:12,136
East Mids.

514
00:28:13,212 --> 00:28:16,341
You know what, Jackie, I think
we'd best call it a night.

515
00:28:16,372 --> 00:28:18,693
Laila ain't sleeping too good,
you know.

516
00:28:19,772 --> 00:28:21,774
Can't say I blame you, mate.

517
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:26,776
- See you in a bit.
- See you.

518
00:28:29,892 --> 00:28:31,894
- Would you excuse me'?
- Yeah, of course.

519
00:28:32,892 --> 00:28:34,178
Hari.

520
00:28:36,372 --> 00:28:38,374
You sure everythings all right'?

521
00:28:38,412 --> 00:28:40,016
Yeah, it's fine, yeah.

522
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,658
It's just the missus
ain't sleeping too good.

523
00:28:42,692 --> 00:28:45,696
Why do I get the feeling
you're not 100% on board'?

524
00:28:47,452 --> 00:28:49,056
l am.

525
00:28:50,132 --> 00:28:53,215
I'm going home...so Laila
can grab an early night, yeah.

526
00:28:58,892 --> 00:29:01,179
You need me to make
the hard choices for you.

527
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:04,494
Because I see what's inside you.

528
00:29:06,292 --> 00:29:07,782
Jelly.

529
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:11,462
The fact is, if we'd not stuck
together, AC-12 would be

530
00:29:11,492 --> 00:29:13,494
charging the lot of us,
not just me.

531
00:29:15,052 --> 00:29:16,542
Worth bearing in mind,

532
00:29:16,572 --> 00:29:19,178
when you've got that nice
little family to provide for.

533
00:29:23,692 --> 00:29:25,182
Love to Laila.

534
00:29:30,732 --> 00:29:32,734
(Chatter)

535
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:50,862
- Hi.
- Hi.

536
00:29:50,892 --> 00:29:52,303
Danny.

537
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,822
Rachel.

538
00:29:57,652 --> 00:29:59,416
Big night out'?

539
00:29:59,452 --> 00:30:01,420
Just a quiet one with workmates.

540
00:30:02,812 --> 00:30:05,543
- Your workmates'?
- Yeah.

541
00:30:08,252 --> 00:30:10,937
Would it be OK if I...
bought you another drink'?

542
00:30:10,972 --> 00:30:13,020
Yeah, that would be OK.

543
00:30:13,052 --> 00:30:14,577
A dry white wine'?

544
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:15,852
Very good.

545
00:30:15,892 --> 00:30:17,303
Great.

546
00:30:25,172 --> 00:30:26,662
This is me.

547
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:34,334
It's really nice to meet you.

548
00:30:34,372 --> 00:30:36,374
Nice to meet you, too.

549
00:30:43,492 --> 00:30:45,096
Can I kiss you'?

550
00:31:01,252 --> 00:31:03,698
- That was nice.
- Very nice.

551
00:31:05,892 --> 00:31:07,974
- Can I get your phone number'?
- Sure.

552
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,261
What's yours?

553
00:31:13,292 --> 00:31:19,538
Er, it's 07700922621.

554
00:31:20,532 --> 00:31:21,977
OK.

555
00:31:22,652 --> 00:31:24,654
Er... Here's mine.

556
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,299
- (Text alert)
- Got it.

557
00:31:28,332 --> 00:31:30,494
Thank you.

558
00:31:32,492 --> 00:31:34,859
- Good night, Rachel.
- Good night.

559
00:32:05,212 --> 00:32:07,692
Listen, Hari, can I talk to you
about something?

560
00:32:08,932 --> 00:32:12,175
In the pub, I couldn't help
noticing you and Danny.

561
00:32:12,212 --> 00:32:14,214
Is he giving you a hard time?

562
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:17,543
Well, when hasn't he'?
But that's just what he's like.

563
00:32:17,572 --> 00:32:20,940
You all stood by him
after he killed a suspect.

564
00:32:21,852 --> 00:32:24,059
Did it really happen
the way you all said it did'?

565
00:32:24,092 --> 00:32:25,582
My advice to you is don't ask.

566
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:29,253
I don't think you've got
any idea what he's capable of.

567
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:30,862
Not a clue.

568
00:32:44,412 --> 00:32:45,777
Kate'?

569
00:32:45,812 --> 00:32:47,814
Danny Waldron's squad.

570
00:32:47,852 --> 00:32:50,253
If anyone's got a wobble,
it's Hari Bains.

571
00:32:51,812 --> 00:32:53,541
Received.

572
00:32:56,172 --> 00:32:59,176
<i>The suspect turned his gun on us
and we returned fire.</i>

573
00:33:01,292 --> 00:33:04,694
<i>The suspect, he discharged
his weapon and we returned fire.</i>

574
00:33:08,372 --> 00:33:11,774
CLOTTAN: <i>Would it be easier for
you to tell us who fired first?</i>

575
00:33:13,852 --> 00:33:17,379
<i>The suspect fired his pistol
at us and we fired back at him.</i>

576
00:33:21,452 --> 00:33:23,853
HASTINGS: <i>But you didn't,
did you, Constable?</i>

577
00:33:23,892 --> 00:33:28,181
<i>No, sir. No. The suspect had
already taken fire to the head</i>

578
00:33:28,212 --> 00:33:29,702
<i>and he went down.</i>

579
00:33:29,732 --> 00:33:32,303
HASTINGS: <i>So, what?
You hesitated, is that it?</i>

580
00:33:32,332 --> 00:33:33,822
<i>No, sir.</i>

581
00:33:33,852 --> 00:33:36,981
<i>No, it just all felt like it
happened in the same moment.</i>

582
00:33:37,012 --> 00:33:40,334
<i>You know, the suspect firing
and then him being taken down.</i>

583
00:33:40,372 --> 00:33:43,103
<i>ARNOTT. Why was there
a patch of gunshot residue</i>

584
00:33:43,132 --> 00:33:46,454
<i>from the suspecfis firearm
five metres away from his body?</i>

585
00:33:47,772 --> 00:33:50,059
<i>It must have been the suspect
was moving</i>

586
00:33:50,092 --> 00:33:52,493
<i>from one position to the other
as he fired.</i>

587
00:33:53,292 --> 00:33:55,181
<i>HASTINGS: Must have?</i>

588
00:33:55,212 --> 00:33:58,534
I mean, he...he was.
He was moving when he fired.

589
00:34:10,092 --> 00:34:12,857
ARNOTT: We know it's not easy,
being confined to desk duty.

590
00:34:12,892 --> 00:34:15,862
COTTAN: Particularly if you're
the only one who didn't fire.

591
00:34:16,852 --> 00:34:19,173
Well, I didn't choke,
if that's what you mean.

592
00:34:19,212 --> 00:34:21,055
No-one said you choked.

593
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:25,017
Yeah, well, you're AC-l2, you're
always looking for an angle.

594
00:34:26,612 --> 00:34:28,614
We appreciate
there's trust issues.

595
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:30,939
No-one wants to seem like
they're telling tales.

596
00:34:30,972 --> 00:34:33,942
But no-one wants to let a bent
copper off the hook, either.

597
00:34:34,932 --> 00:34:38,823
But we've read your record.
You're an honest copper.

598
00:34:38,852 --> 00:34:40,980
This is bothering you,
Harinderpal.

599
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,616
Hari.

600
00:34:43,692 --> 00:34:46,502
It's bothering you, Hari. A lot.

601
00:34:55,892 --> 00:34:59,613
Look, I told Waldron to let the
suspect go. We were in pursuit.

602
00:34:59,652 --> 00:35:02,701
The bloke was gonna carry out a
hit, half the Force on his tail.

603
00:35:02,732 --> 00:35:05,417
You knew Waldron was out of
control and tried to deter him'?

604
00:35:05,452 --> 00:35:08,217
- I never said "out of control".
COTTAN: What are you saying?

605
00:35:08,252 --> 00:35:11,301
You followed Danny Waldron's
script to the letter.

606
00:35:11,332 --> 00:35:14,256
Except for one moment. The
little patch of gunshot residue

607
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:16,898
that was nowhere near where
the suspects gun was found.

608
00:35:16,932 --> 00:35:18,343
See what I mean'?

609
00:35:18,372 --> 00:35:21,216
You act like every copper's bent
till he's proven otherwise.

610
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:23,061
- But I'm clean.
COTTAN: Prove it.

611
00:35:23,092 --> 00:35:24,821
Tell us what really happened.

612
00:35:24,852 --> 00:35:27,423
Why was there so much
gunshot residue on Waldron'?

613
00:35:27,452 --> 00:35:30,661
What did he really do when he
claimed he was securing it'?

614
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:35,661
I can't do this.

615
00:35:35,692 --> 00:35:38,536
(Clears throat) I'm sorry.
I can't do this. There's...

616
00:35:38,572 --> 00:35:42,293
There's no way I'm testifying
against Danny Waldron.

617
00:36:02,052 --> 00:36:03,542
(Engine starts)

618
00:36:03,572 --> 00:36:05,336
<i>Hari Bains is
damned if he does,</i>

619
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:07,181
damned if he doesn't,
poor bugger.

620
00:36:07,212 --> 00:36:09,135
We'll be able to compel him.
I'm sure, sir.

621
00:36:09,172 --> 00:36:10,537
If we can get to threshold,

622
00:36:10,572 --> 00:36:12,574
he'll go with the flew
to save his own neck.

623
00:36:12,612 --> 00:36:14,694
We're a long way
from threshold yet, though.

624
00:36:14,732 --> 00:36:17,975
I've really got to go now.
Talk later. Bye.

625
00:36:18,012 --> 00:36:19,935
- Gill.
- Sorry.

626
00:36:20,972 --> 00:36:22,940
The Police Federation
are pushing back

627
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,974
against Danny Waldron's
treatment.

628
00:36:25,012 --> 00:36:27,856
I got an email from their lawyer
that was three pages long.

629
00:36:28,732 --> 00:36:31,861
They want him operational and
his firearms permit reinstated,

630
00:36:31,892 --> 00:36:35,419
unless you can show there's
substantive suspicion of crime

631
00:36:35,452 --> 00:36:38,296
and/or misconduct and/or
Endangerment to Public Trust.

632
00:36:38,332 --> 00:36:39,822
Well, we've got them all.

633
00:36:39,852 --> 00:36:42,093
You don't have
Endangerment of Public Trust

634
00:36:42,132 --> 00:36:44,658
as Operation Damson
remains unreponed in the press

635
00:36:44,692 --> 00:36:46,296
as per a legal
suppression order.

636
00:36:46,332 --> 00:36:48,983
So, what have you got regarding
crime and/or misconduct?

637
00:36:49,012 --> 00:36:51,856
There's a strong suspicion
Danny Waldron was adjacent

638
00:36:51,892 --> 00:36:54,259
to the suspect when the
suspects firearm went eff,

639
00:36:54,292 --> 00:36:55,817
and that Waldron
moved the firearm

640
00:36:55,852 --> 00:36:57,456
before Forensics
got to the scene.

641
00:36:57,492 --> 00:36:59,301
I've listened to the tape.

642
00:36:59,332 --> 00:37:01,061
You all did your best,

643
00:37:01,092 --> 00:37:04,494
but Waldron deals plausibly
with all your areas of inquiry

644
00:37:04,532 --> 00:37:06,739
and his team's statements
back him up.

645
00:37:06,772 --> 00:37:09,503
We interviewed one of his team,
PC Harinderpal Bains,

646
00:37:09,532 --> 00:37:11,534
who we strongly suspect
is detachable

647
00:37:11,572 --> 00:37:13,381
from Waldron's version
of events.

648
00:37:13,412 --> 00:37:15,494
- Is he on the record'?
- No, ma'am, but...

649
00:37:15,532 --> 00:37:19,139
I'm a civilian - Gill or Miss
Biggeloe. So not on the record.

650
00:37:19,172 --> 00:37:20,901
No. But we have
an officer undercover

651
00:37:20,932 --> 00:37:23,253
probing for weaknesses
in the team's statements.

652
00:37:23,292 --> 00:37:24,817
Has she found any'?

653
00:37:24,852 --> 00:37:26,854
Not yet,
but she's only just started.

654
00:37:26,892 --> 00:37:29,099
So she hasn't.

655
00:37:29,132 --> 00:37:31,658
Look, I've seen enough
bent coppers in my time

656
00:37:31,692 --> 00:37:33,421
to know when one
is hiding something.

657
00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:35,056
You know why
I've been appointed?

658
00:37:35,092 --> 00:37:38,096
To ensure that anticorruption
inquiries don't get pulled apart

659
00:37:38,132 --> 00:37:40,499
in court, to everyone's
embarrassment.

660
00:37:40,532 --> 00:37:43,297
Yeah, well, we'd all be
severely embarrassed if

661
00:37:43,332 --> 00:37:46,495
Daniel Waldron manages to pull
something like this off again.

662
00:37:46,532 --> 00:37:49,695
We are protecting the public
and, sometimes, that means

663
00:37:49,732 --> 00:37:52,133
we have to protect them
from our own officers.

664
00:37:52,172 --> 00:37:53,412
Legally, this case is weak.

665
00:37:53,452 --> 00:37:56,262
Juries don't convict police
officers for killing suspects.

666
00:37:56,292 --> 00:37:58,579
I've got no option but
to recommend that Waldron

667
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:00,216
and his team
return to active duty

668
00:38:00,252 --> 00:38:02,858
and that their firearms permits
are reinstated.

669
00:38:11,492 --> 00:38:14,655
What'? She's running
our investigations now'?

670
00:38:17,932 --> 00:38:20,060
Search of premises.
Class A drugs.

671
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:22,698
Residents are known
to be in possession

672
00:38:22,732 --> 00:38:24,734
and have access to firearms.

673
00:38:26,132 --> 00:38:27,736
Good to be back.

674
00:38:51,572 --> 00:38:53,176
WALDRON: Armed police!

675
00:38:55,812 --> 00:38:57,302
Armed police!

676
00:38:57,332 --> 00:39:00,893
Jacks, you, Rod and Hari secure
these rooms. Kate, with me.

677
00:39:05,452 --> 00:39:06,942
Go. Go.

678
00:39:12,732 --> 00:39:14,734
WALDRON: Armed police!

679
00:39:25,972 --> 00:39:27,212
Armed police!

680
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,022
Armed police!

681
00:39:42,452 --> 00:39:44,454
All clear. Check the landing.

682
00:40:03,612 --> 00:40:05,853
Kate, check in with the others.

683
00:40:06,692 --> 00:40:08,581
Victor Charlie Five Five.

684
00:40:08,612 --> 00:40:10,137
ROD: <i>Five</i> Two.
- Status?

685
00:40:10,172 --> 00:40:11,662
<i>Still checking.</i>

686
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,294
Move. Move!

687
00:40:24,612 --> 00:40:26,341
Armed police!

688
00:40:26,372 --> 00:40:28,374
(Birds fluttering away)

689
00:40:42,572 --> 00:40:44,176
- No!
- Aah!

690
00:40:46,692 --> 00:40:48,660
Check your safety. Stand down.

691
00:40:48,692 --> 00:40:50,296
Get the search team in here.

692
00:40:50,332 --> 00:40:52,938
And we need an ambulance
and social services.

693
00:40:52,972 --> 00:40:54,417
BAINS: Yes, skipper.

694
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,693
It's all right.
No-one's gonna hum you.

695
00:40:56,732 --> 00:40:58,496
Good boy.

696
00:40:58,532 --> 00:41:01,502
- (Boy grizzles)
WALDRON: It's all right. Ssh.

697
00:41:01,532 --> 00:41:03,341
How old are you, eh'?

698
00:41:06,892 --> 00:41:08,894
(Boy cries)

699
00:41:12,172 --> 00:41:13,776
Hi, it's me.

700
00:41:14,852 --> 00:41:16,934
Yeah, fine.
Just I'll be busy later.

701
00:41:16,972 --> 00:41:19,498
I just wanted to get him
before he went to bed.

702
00:41:20,572 --> 00:41:21,778
Thanks.

703
00:41:24,652 --> 00:41:26,939
Hi, sweetheart
Have you had a nice day'?

704
00:41:28,932 --> 00:41:30,343
Have you'?

705
00:41:30,372 --> 00:41:32,374
Aw, that's lovely.

706
00:41:50,372 --> 00:41:52,374
MAN: Sergeant Waldron.

707
00:41:59,492 --> 00:42:00,778
Kate'?

708
00:42:04,492 --> 00:42:06,494
There's no easy way to say this.

709
00:42:08,332 --> 00:42:10,096
This isn't gonna work.

710
00:42:10,812 --> 00:42:13,213
Look, nobody feels worse
about what happened -

711
00:42:13,252 --> 00:42:14,902
what nearly happened -
than I do.

712
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:17,060
I decide who's right
for my team.

713
00:42:17,092 --> 00:42:19,698
No-one else.
Who can out it and who can't.

714
00:42:19,732 --> 00:42:23,020
It's nothing personal.
You're just not up to the job.

715
00:42:23,052 --> 00:42:24,861
I messed up, but I'll learn.

716
00:42:24,892 --> 00:42:27,213
- I don't give in, skipper.
- Neither do I.

717
00:42:29,212 --> 00:42:31,499
Best you put in for a transfer.

718
00:42:32,172 --> 00:42:34,573
Save me having to turn nasty.

719
00:42:56,172 --> 00:42:57,662
Sorry.

720
00:42:58,532 --> 00:43:00,534
Don't be. It's a free country.

721
00:43:01,772 --> 00:43:03,774
Here you are.

722
00:43:08,092 --> 00:43:09,582
There you go.

723
00:43:13,732 --> 00:43:15,860
So, have you worked
with Jackie long'?

724
00:43:15,892 --> 00:43:17,894
A couple of years, on and off.

725
00:43:17,932 --> 00:43:19,616
And Danny'?

726
00:43:20,692 --> 00:43:22,023
A bit less.

727
00:43:22,052 --> 00:43:23,861
I don't get the impression
there's...

728
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,303
Sorry, Kate. Sorry, listen.

729
00:43:25,332 --> 00:43:27,938
I'm just not feeling
very sociable right now.

730
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:29,462
No worries.

731
00:43:30,252 --> 00:43:32,095
All right'?

732
00:43:38,132 --> 00:43:39,736
Right. I'd better get in.

733
00:43:39,772 --> 00:43:41,695
See you in a bit.

734
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:51,061
Look, I'm sorry.

735
00:43:52,892 --> 00:43:55,372
What else can I say to you'?

736
00:43:55,412 --> 00:43:57,414
How do you think
I feel right now'?

737
00:43:57,452 --> 00:43:58,863
Just ignore him.

738
00:43:58,892 --> 00:44:01,099
Ignore him.
Are you taking the piss'?

739
00:44:11,172 --> 00:44:12,662
Thanks.

740
00:44:13,532 --> 00:44:15,022
Finally.

741
00:44:16,452 --> 00:44:18,739
Is that the file on the suspect
shot by Waldron'?

742
00:44:18,772 --> 00:44:20,058
Yeah.

743
00:44:26,172 --> 00:44:27,458
What'?

744
00:44:33,612 --> 00:44:35,899
We need an unredacted file.

745
00:44:35,932 --> 00:44:38,458
Leave it to me.
I'll crack some heads together.

746
00:45:08,692 --> 00:45:10,296
You shouldn't be here.

747
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:12,812
That only applies
if we're investigating you.

748
00:45:12,852 --> 00:45:15,617
- You're off the hook.
- What do you want'?

749
00:45:15,652 --> 00:45:17,222
You didn't know the suspect?

750
00:45:17,252 --> 00:45:18,538
Oh...

751
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,378
No.

752
00:45:21,412 --> 00:45:24,302
Not heard a rumour about him,
heard the name'?

753
00:45:24,332 --> 00:45:26,539
You need to caution me
before you can ask that.

754
00:45:26,572 --> 00:45:28,495
Like this is on the record.

755
00:45:28,532 --> 00:45:30,341
I just want to know the truth.

756
00:45:35,292 --> 00:45:37,294
The file on Ronan Murphy...

757
00:45:38,252 --> 00:45:39,777
The suspect's name.

758
00:45:39,812 --> 00:45:43,100
...large sections were redacted.

759
00:45:43,132 --> 00:45:45,533
If there's something
bigger here, Danny,

760
00:45:45,572 --> 00:45:48,382
you don't want to be the one
left carrying the can.

761
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:50,897
Do you run, Steve?

762
00:45:50,932 --> 00:45:52,536
I don't have to.

763
00:45:52,572 --> 00:45:54,381
No-one's chasing me.

764
00:45:54,412 --> 00:45:55,902
I do.

765
00:45:57,292 --> 00:46:00,296
Miles, some nights,
tens of miles.

766
00:46:00,332 --> 00:46:02,414
It gets so
every part of me hurts.

767
00:46:04,172 --> 00:46:07,574
But the one thing I know is,
you keep going through the pain,

768
00:46:07,612 --> 00:46:10,661
because, if you stop,
it's gonna hum a whole lot more

769
00:46:10,692 --> 00:46:12,296
to get started again.

770
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,814
When this is all done, Steve,

771
00:46:15,852 --> 00:46:17,775
I'll suffer for my actions.

772
00:46:18,452 --> 00:46:20,932
I'm under no illusions
of a happy ending.

773
00:46:21,772 --> 00:46:23,774
But I ain't gonna stop.

774
00:46:30,452 --> 00:46:31,942
Danny...

775
00:46:32,652 --> 00:46:35,019
One thing we both know.

776
00:46:35,052 --> 00:46:37,862
The easiest way to get away
with killing someone...

777
00:46:37,892 --> 00:46:39,894
be a police officer.

778
00:46:49,372 --> 00:46:50,976
(Doorbell)

779
00:47:00,932 --> 00:47:02,934
(Dog barks in distance)

780
00:47:32,172 --> 00:47:33,333
(Beeps)

781
00:47:34,332 --> 00:47:35,458
(Beeps)

782
00:47:51,532 --> 00:47:52,818
See you.

783
00:47:52,852 --> 00:47:55,458
Come on. Do you want to have
a go with the light?

784
00:47:56,932 --> 00:47:59,538
Press the button.
Press the button for Daddy.

785
00:47:59,572 --> 00:48:02,940
Won't be long before you're
driving yourself, will it'?

786
00:48:02,972 --> 00:48:05,259
It'll be a few years yet!
Have a good day.

787
00:48:05,292 --> 00:48:06,976
- See you.
- See you later.

788
00:48:22,892 --> 00:48:24,382
Hari.

789
00:48:25,452 --> 00:48:26,658
Ma'am.

790
00:48:26,692 --> 00:48:28,296
Are you all right, Hari'?

791
00:48:28,332 --> 00:48:30,494
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks, guv.

792
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:33,581
I'm concerned about the unit's
interpersonal dynamics.

793
00:48:33,612 --> 00:48:35,819
So I'm gonna disband
Danny's squad.

794
00:48:38,292 --> 00:48:40,420
What did Danny have to say
about that'?

795
00:48:40,452 --> 00:48:41,863
He won't be the problem.

796
00:48:41,892 --> 00:48:44,418
The problem will be
getting AFOs to work with him.

797
00:48:46,332 --> 00:48:47,618
Well...

798
00:48:49,532 --> 00:48:52,615
He's not the easiest skipper,
but he's good at his job.

799
00:48:53,692 --> 00:48:56,696
I'm learning loads from him.
So I'd rather keep at it.

800
00:48:56,732 --> 00:48:58,018
Seriously?

801
00:48:58,052 --> 00:48:59,338
Yeah.

802
00:48:59,372 --> 00:49:02,899
If you move us on now, ma'am,
then it looks like we messed up.

803
00:49:02,932 --> 00:49:04,457
And we didn't.

804
00:49:13,532 --> 00:49:17,139
Man that is born of a woman
hath but a short time to live

805
00:49:17,172 --> 00:49:19,174
and is full of misery.

806
00:49:20,572 --> 00:49:23,781
He cometh up and is out down,
like a flower.

807
00:49:23,812 --> 00:49:26,418
He fleeth, as it were a shadow,

808
00:49:26,452 --> 00:49:29,058
and never continueth
in one stay.

809
00:49:30,172 --> 00:49:31,776
Let us pray.

810
00:49:41,172 --> 00:49:43,698
Here you are, girl.
Come on, Rosie. Good dog.

811
00:49:45,452 --> 00:49:46,942
There you go.

812
00:49:53,212 --> 00:49:54,623
(Bell pings)

813
00:50:07,572 --> 00:50:09,062
Don't remember me'?

814
00:50:11,292 --> 00:50:13,294
- No.
- No'?

815
00:50:14,132 --> 00:50:16,703
Nor did the man that you buried.

816
00:50:20,612 --> 00:50:22,216
(vans)

817
00:50:23,572 --> 00:50:25,176
(Rosie whines)

818
00:50:25,932 --> 00:50:27,536
Get down.

819
00:50:36,972 --> 00:50:38,781
Sit.

820
00:50:40,572 --> 00:50:43,701
Every time you don't do
what I say, it gets worse.

821
00:50:45,012 --> 00:50:46,821
You'll sit. All right'?

822
00:50:48,452 --> 00:50:49,942
But first...

823
00:50:52,932 --> 00:50:55,014
...you'll take off
all your clothes.

824
00:51:09,612 --> 00:51:11,614
I never knew his name.

825
00:51:12,612 --> 00:51:14,023
Not really.

826
00:51:16,012 --> 00:51:18,014
We did have a name for him,
though.

827
00:51:21,492 --> 00:51:25,099
Se many years I wondered what
I'd do if I ever saw him again.

828
00:51:26,372 --> 00:51:28,181
And then I did.

829
00:51:28,212 --> 00:51:30,499
In a photo, in a briefing room.

830
00:51:34,692 --> 00:51:37,172
And I was being sent to meet him
with a gun.

831
00:51:42,292 --> 00:51:45,421
Before you ask...
this isn't the one.

832
00:51:47,052 --> 00:51:49,054
Illegal. Untraceable.

833
00:51:49,092 --> 00:51:51,094
No problem with using it on you.

834
00:52:04,052 --> 00:52:06,293
So, who was he to you'?

835
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:07,493
Nephew.

836
00:52:10,332 --> 00:52:13,063
I never knew that there was
a family connection.

837
00:52:17,052 --> 00:52:19,054
We had a name for you, too.

838
00:52:20,532 --> 00:52:22,500
Do you want to know what it was'?

839
00:52:24,732 --> 00:52:26,734
Do you want to know what it was'?

840
00:52:26,772 --> 00:52:28,774
(Laughs)

841
00:52:32,092 --> 00:52:33,696
Oh...

842
00:52:37,212 --> 00:52:39,818
- (Man groans)
- (Chair crashes to floor)

843
00:52:46,772 --> 00:52:49,742
The only thing with Ronan,
it was over too fast.

844
00:52:51,132 --> 00:52:53,419
But I've got you
to make up for that.

845
00:53:46,492 --> 00:53:48,779
Here you go. Here.

846
00:53:55,172 --> 00:53:57,174
(Text alert)

847
00:54:29,452 --> 00:54:30,783
Uh!

848
00:54:31,932 --> 00:54:33,536
(Phone rings)

849
00:54:44,252 --> 00:54:46,061
Sergeant Waldron.

850
00:54:46,092 --> 00:54:48,094
(Siren wails)

851
00:54:54,932 --> 00:54:58,175
- Four Zero, radio check.
- Seven Zero, radio check.

852
00:54:58,212 --> 00:55:01,500
<i>Intel reports no egress
from the premises this morning.</i>

853

857
00:55:13,492 --> 00:55:14,778
Six Zero, received.

858
00:55:57,732 --> 00:55:59,541
Armed police!

859
00:56:00,612 --> 00:56:02,614
- Armed police!
- Armed police!

860
00:56:02,652 --> 00:56:05,178
- Armed police!
- Nobody move! Armed police!

861
00:56:07,692 --> 00:56:09,979
Armed police!
Show me your hands.

862
00:56:10,012 --> 00:56:12,379
Turn around. Hands behind
your back. Walk to me.

863
00:56:13,452 --> 00:56:15,056
Keep coming.

864
00:56:15,092 --> 00:56:16,662
Move!

865
00:56:16,692 --> 00:56:19,582
Turn around. Hands behind
your back. Behind your back!

866
00:56:19,612 --> 00:56:20,977
To me!

867
00:56:21,012 --> 00:56:22,696
ROD: Move. Move!

868
00:56:22,732 --> 00:56:24,894
Who else is in the house?

869
00:56:24,932 --> 00:56:26,582
No-one.

870
00:56:29,092 --> 00:56:31,220
We're going up.
Call it in, Channel 1.

871
00:56:31,252 --> 00:56:33,254
Victor Charlie Five Five on 1.

872
00:56:33,292 --> 00:56:35,693
<i>Victor Charlie Four One.
Go ahead, Five Five.</i>

873
00:56:35,732 --> 00:56:38,053
Two suspects in custody.
Continuing the search.

874
00:56:38,092 --> 00:56:40,333
Hari, Rod, Jacks, go up.
Kate, stay put.

875
00:56:40,372 --> 00:56:42,579
- I'm good to go up.
- You lot go up.

876
00:56:42,612 --> 00:56:44,216
Back-to-back on 2.

877
00:56:59,852 --> 00:57:01,263
Stay on 1.

878
00:57:02,332 --> 00:57:04,096
Are you really gonna be
like this?

879
00:57:04,132 --> 00:57:06,180
You had your chance
to make this painless.

880
00:57:06,212 --> 00:57:08,453
In the morning,
I'm telling McAndrew

881
00:57:08,492 --> 00:57:10,221
to bump you off the squad.

882
00:57:10,252 --> 00:57:12,061
BAINS: Victor Charlie <i>Five</i> One.

883
00:57:12,092 --> 00:57:13,378
Five One.

884
00:57:13,412 --> 00:57:15,983
BAINS: <i>Five Four. You'd better
come up here, skipper.</i>

885
00:57:16,012 --> 00:57:17,696
On my Way-

886
00:57:17,732 --> 00:57:19,461
Don't move a muscle.

887
00:57:19,492 --> 00:57:20,903
(Cocks gun)

888
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:37,138
(Gunshot)

889
00:57:37,172 --> 00:57:39,334
- Who else is up there?
- No-one! I told you!

890
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:41,852
Shot fired! Five Five.
No further information.

<i>- Shot fired!

- Shit!</i>

(Mumbles)

899
00:58:03,132 --> 00:58:05,499
- Officer seriously wounded.
- What happened'?

900
00:58:07,572 --> 00:58:08,698
Shit.

901
00:58:10,932 --> 00:58:12,980
We have a status zero
on one of our officers.

902
00:58:13,012 --> 00:58:14,741
Stay with me, Danny!
Stay with me.

<i>Urgent medical attention
required!</i>

904

- (Waldron gurgles)
ROD: What's he saying?

<i>We have an officer down.</i>

1
00:00:02,687 --> 00:00:05,687
The target of the 5th September
ambush was a protected witness.

2
00:00:05,861 --> 00:00:08,860
John Thomas Hunter...

3
00:00:08,861 --> 00:00:12,861
DI Denton, I'm arresting you
for conspiracy to murder
a protected witness.

4
00:00:14,861 --> 00:00:18,860
DS Akers was the person closest
to the witness, trusted by him.

5
00:00:18,861 --> 00:00:21,860
You two always used to end
up side by side.

6
00:00:21,861 --> 00:00:25,861
I'd rather not investigate
the death of a former colleague.
I like keeping a distance.

7
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,860
On the night of the ambush,
he called me.

8
00:00:29,861 --> 00:00:32,861
Why'd you hide it?

9
00:00:33,861 --> 00:00:35,860
Rich and I were involved,
behind Jayne's back.

10
00:00:35,861 --> 00:00:39,860
Looks like Jayne Akers
was on the receiving end
of a substantial payment.

11
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:40,860
How substantial?

12
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:41,861
Upwards of 50 grand.

13
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:47,861
Nurse? Where's the...?

14
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:51,581
Who is that man?

15
00:00:51,582 --> 00:00:54,460
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

16
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:59,860
The records show that Superintendent
Hastings is in considerable
financial difficulties.

17
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:01,860
I'd like you to carry on.

18
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,860
Very grateful, sir. Thank you, sir.

19
00:01:03,861 --> 00:01:05,981
The fewer people know
about your situation the better.

20
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,861
Don't you see how I've been set up?

21
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,986
The only person I told about the
operation was Mike Dryden.

22
00:01:13,987 --> 00:01:17,087
On the night of the ambush,
this particular officer caused
the rota to be changed.

23
00:01:17,102 --> 00:01:19,302
Does the Deputy Chief Constable
have a statement

24
00:01:19,326 --> 00:01:21,726
regarding the allegation
about his speeding offence?

25
00:01:21,752 --> 00:01:23,752
My wife and I strenuously deny
the allegation.

26
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:28,310
Hargreaves calls you "Jolly".

27
00:01:28,311 --> 00:01:30,310
"Jolly" Rogerson.

28
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:31,310
He's a laugh a minute.

29
00:01:31,311 --> 00:01:33,310
So there's a body?

30
00:01:33,311 --> 00:01:35,310
We're taking it from here.

31
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:37,310
I was only searching for Carly.

32
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:39,310
Of all the long-term mispers,
why her?

33
00:01:39,311 --> 00:01:41,311
Call me later for initial forensics.

34
00:01:46,311 --> 00:01:49,310
You've been talking to AC-12!

35
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:51,311
I believe you.

36
00:01:57,311 --> 00:01:59,310
'Now it's three minutes to seven

37
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:01,311
'and you're listening
to the Breakfast Show.'

39
00:02:10,311 --> 00:02:12,310
Morning...

40
00:02:12,311 --> 00:02:14,311
Morning...

41
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:05,310
I've had to disclose
the situation at work.

42
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:06,310
Our situation?

43
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,310
No, no, just the money.

44
00:03:08,311 --> 00:03:11,310
Now the whole world
knows our business.

45
00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:14,310
No, no. Just one executive officer,
in confidence. A top man.

46
00:03:14,311 --> 00:03:18,310
In fact, this particular officer
thinks very highly of me

47
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:20,311
so I can see things getting
a lot better.

48
00:03:22,311 --> 00:03:23,311
How so?

49
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:27,310
If I was to put myself
forward for promotion,

50
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:30,310
when this case is finished.

51
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:33,311
This particular officer more or less
tipped me the wink.

52
00:03:35,311 --> 00:03:37,310
Right.

53
00:03:37,311 --> 00:03:39,310
A promotion's no small thing,
love.

54
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:41,310
Pay rise.

55
00:03:41,311 --> 00:03:43,311
Bigger pension.

56
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:52,310
We need to be clear about a few
things first.

57
00:03:52,311 --> 00:03:55,310
I'll say it again,

58
00:03:55,311 --> 00:04:00,310
I am deeply sorry for having not
consulted you about the finances.

59
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:02,311
It was a mistake.

60
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,311
I just wanted to surprise you.

61
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:17,311
Where's the harm in looking?

62
00:04:20,311 --> 00:04:24,310
Right, we've all read this report.
Looks like DS Akers was on the take.

63
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:26,310
Well, it's only circumstantial
so far.

64
00:04:26,311 --> 00:04:29,310
If the officer meant to be looking
after a protected witness is

65
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,310
getting paid off and that witness
gets killed,

66
00:04:31,311 --> 00:04:35,311
it doesn't leave much room
for circumstance as far
as I'm concerned.

67
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:39,310
Sorry, mate.

68
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:41,310
Evidence is evidence. Good.

69
00:04:41,311 --> 00:04:43,310
Dot, Steve...

70
00:04:43,311 --> 00:04:45,310
The husband, you said
he was acting suspiciously?

71
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:47,310
I could've jumped to the wrong
conclusion.

72
00:04:47,311 --> 00:04:50,310
It's fine, Steve.
Let's just do our job.

73
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:53,310
Well said, Kate.
Let's put it beyond doubt.

74
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:57,310
Let's bring the husband
in for questioning
and do a 32 search on his house.

75
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:58,310
Very good, sir. Off you go.

76
00:04:58,311 --> 00:05:01,310
Sir. We haven't discussed
Deputy Chief Constable Dryden.

77
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:05,310
Denton's thrown suspicion towards
him and so far it's all checked out.

78
00:05:05,311 --> 00:05:07,310
They worked together.
They had contact outside of work

79
00:05:07,311 --> 00:05:10,311
and he made sure she was on duty
the night of the ambush.

80
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:17,310
That is one hell of an accusation to
throw at a senior officer, Steve.

81
00:05:17,311 --> 00:05:22,310
Especially a senior officer with such
an outstanding record of public service.

82
00:05:22,311 --> 00:05:24,310
Well, there is this story that was
leaked to the press, about him

83
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:27,310
and his wife swapping
points on a driving offence.

84
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:28,310
Now with respect, sir,

85
00:05:28,311 --> 00:05:31,310
if we didn't look into it
it'd look like favouritism.

86
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:34,310
And sir, I checked Dryden's
web-site.

87
00:05:34,311 --> 00:05:36,310
He leaves tomorrow for a series
of speaking engagements.

88
00:05:36,311 --> 00:05:40,310
If we don't bring him in today, we
lose him for the rest of the week.

89
00:05:40,311 --> 00:05:42,310
We can delay bringing
in Rich Akers for 24 hours.

90
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:44,310
He's going nowhere,
he's got no idea we're onto him.

91
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:48,310
Dryden's potentially more closely
involved with the ambush
and that has to be our priority.

92
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:51,311
And if only to rule him
out as soon as possible.

93
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,310
Right, well, no mistakes, mind,

94
00:05:55,311 --> 00:05:57,310
I want all the Is dotted,
all the Ts crossed

95
00:05:57,311 --> 00:06:00,310
before that man sets one foot in
this building, you understand?

96
00:06:00,311 --> 00:06:02,311
Sir. On you go.

97
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:21,311
Elvis has entered the building.

98
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:31,310
Thank you for your cooperation, sir.

99
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:34,310
I hope this isn't going
to take long, Ted.

100
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:38,310
Just waiting on Chief Constable Lightwater,
sir, because of the special arrangements.

101
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:40,310
Barry Lightwater's coming up?

102
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:42,310
His force are having a ding-dong
with the PCC at the minute.

103
00:06:42,311 --> 00:06:45,311
Between ourselves I think he'll
be glad of the away-day.

104
00:06:50,311 --> 00:06:52,311
As I said, sir, we're very grateful.

105
00:07:21,311 --> 00:07:22,310
As you were.

106
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:23,311
Thank you, sir.

107
00:07:26,311 --> 00:07:29,310
Sorry, sorry. Don't get up.

108
00:07:29,311 --> 00:07:30,310
Sir, if you wouldn't mind...

109
00:07:30,311 --> 00:07:32,311
Thanks, Ted.
Thank you. Thank you.

110
00:07:33,311 --> 00:07:37,310
I think the way this works
is you'll only hear from me
if there's anything untoward.

111
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:39,311
Thank you, sir. Thanks, sir.

112
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:52,310
AC-12 interview of Deputy Chief
Constable Michael Dryden,

113
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:57,310
with Superintendent Hastings,
DI Cottan, DS Arnott, DC Fleming.

114
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:00,310
Normal practice is that the
interviewee be

115
00:08:00,311 --> 00:08:02,310
questioned by an officer at least
one rank superior.

116
00:08:02,311 --> 00:08:05,310
However in this case that
cannot happen,

117
00:08:05,311 --> 00:08:09,310
so Chief Constable Lightwater
of the East Midlands Constabulary

118
00:08:09,311 --> 00:08:11,310
has kindly agreed to
sit in as an observer.

119
00:08:11,311 --> 00:08:13,310
Is that all right with you
and the ACPO?

120
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,310
I'm ready. Let's get on with it.

121
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:16,310
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

122
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:19,310
Well, I refer you to
Document 1 in your folders.

123
00:08:19,311 --> 00:08:23,310
A complaint has been made
regarding a traffic offence,

124
00:08:23,311 --> 00:08:24,310
an SP-30,

125
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:29,310
which occurred on the night
of August 16th this year.

126
00:08:29,311 --> 00:08:31,310
The vehicle registered to Mrs
Helen Dryden

127
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:34,310
was photographed by a speed
camera travelling in excess

128
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:36,310
of the speed limit.

129
00:08:36,311 --> 00:08:39,310
Then, a week later on August 23rd,

130
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:42,310
the Traffic Division received
notice from Mrs Helen Dryden

131
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:44,310
that at the time the incident
occurred,

132
00:08:44,311 --> 00:08:47,310
the vehicle was actually being
driven by yourself, Deputy Chief
Constable Dryden.

133
00:08:47,311 --> 00:08:51,310
Correct. An allegation has
been made that Mrs Dryden

134
00:08:51,311 --> 00:08:55,310
and/or yourself falsified
that notification. Untrue.

135
00:08:55,311 --> 00:08:58,310
I was driving. Helen was home.

136
00:08:58,311 --> 00:09:01,310
And, remember the reason
for your journey that evening?

137
00:09:01,311 --> 00:09:05,310
I left home and drove back towards
town to buy some beer
and wine from the off-licence.

138
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,310
Changed my mind, went back home.

139
00:09:07,311 --> 00:09:11,310
And can you account
for the allegation to the contrary?

140
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:14,310
I'm a target. Someone
in the organisation wants
to make me look bad.

141
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:16,310
I hope you'll spend as much time
looking for them as you do

142
00:09:16,311 --> 00:09:20,310
investigating this codswallop.
We will, sir. We will.

143
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:22,310
Glad to hear it.

144
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:26,310
Would I be able to ask
a question, sir?

145
00:09:26,311 --> 00:09:27,310
Full marks for balls. Go on.

146
00:09:27,311 --> 00:09:30,310
You didn't go into the off-licence?

147
00:09:30,311 --> 00:09:32,310
No. So the only person likely to
have seen you leave

148
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:35,310
and return home is Mrs Dryden?
Most probably.

149
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:37,310
Will we be able to take
a statement from Mrs Dryden?

150
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:39,310
Don't they train you
people any more?

151
00:09:39,311 --> 00:09:41,310
A spouse isn't a compellable
witness.

152
00:09:41,311 --> 00:09:45,310
Sir, we're under no obligation to
inform your wife that she's
not a compellable witness

153
00:09:45,311 --> 00:09:50,310
and whether she can or can't give
evidence against you is a moot
point as per R v L 2008.

154
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:52,310
I'll inform her. She'll back me up.

155
00:09:52,311 --> 00:09:54,310
Nothing moot there. Anything else?

156
00:09:54,311 --> 00:09:57,310
Why did you change your mind about
going into the off-licence?

157
00:09:57,311 --> 00:09:58,311
Just did.

158
00:10:00,311 --> 00:10:01,310
Erm...

159
00:10:01,311 --> 00:10:04,310
If I may, sir, there's just a few
loose ends I'd like to clear up

160
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:09,310
regarding our investigation
into the ambush of the night
of September 5th.

161
00:10:09,311 --> 00:10:13,310
My number one priority.
Anything to help. Thank you, sir.

162
00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:14,310
DC Fleming, sir.

163
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:17,310
You took a call that
evening from DI Lindsay Denton?

164
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:20,310
Yes, she couldn't get hold of her
Duty Chief Superintendent.

165
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:23,310
She called me. I gave Gold
approval for the operation.

166
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:26,310
Did she disclose to you
the nature of the operation, sir?

167
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:28,310
No, I regularly sign
off on operations without knowing

168
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:30,311
the first bloody thing about them.

169
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:35,310
Sorry, sir. Specifically, sir, did
you give approval to DI Denton to

170
00:10:35,311 --> 00:10:38,310
proceed without back-up
and without firearms?

171
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:40,310
Wasn't the call recorded?

172
00:10:40,311 --> 00:10:43,310
She made the call from her office
phone and not the Duty Desk,

173
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:45,311
so no, sir.

174
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:50,310
I don't recall DI Denton
apprising me of those facts.

175
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:54,310
If she had, I would've expressed
misgivings, of course.

176
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:56,310
In terms of the on-call rotas,

177
00:10:56,311 --> 00:10:59,310
specifically the ghost rota
for 4th Street Station,

178
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:02,310
is that something you'd ever
normally take an interest in?

179
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:04,310
Why would I?

180
00:11:04,311 --> 00:11:06,310
So you weren't involved at all
in the circumstances that led to

181
00:11:06,311 --> 00:11:09,310
DI Denton being the Duty Inspector
that evening?

182
00:11:09,311 --> 00:11:11,310
I also personally supervise

183
00:11:11,311 --> 00:11:14,311
whether beat bobbies put on their
left shoe first or their right.

184
00:11:16,311 --> 00:11:17,310
Anything else?

185
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:20,310
Sir, could anyone have overheard the
conversation you had with DI Denton?

186
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:22,310
Only my wife.

187
00:11:22,311 --> 00:11:25,310
Somehow it feels like we've been
here before, DS... Arnott, sir.

188
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,310
Did she overhear or did you
discuss the call with her?

189
00:11:28,311 --> 00:11:29,310
Where are we going with this?

190
00:11:29,311 --> 00:11:32,310
Sir, I think DS Arnott's worried
that your wife may have got

191
00:11:32,311 --> 00:11:34,311
her sewing circle to carry
out the ambush.

192
00:11:37,311 --> 00:11:39,310
I think we can safely discount
that theory, DI...

193
00:11:39,311 --> 00:11:41,310
Cottan, sir.

194
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:45,310
Cottan. That's right. The witness
protection expert from AC-9.

195
00:11:45,311 --> 00:11:46,310
That's right, sir.

196
00:11:46,311 --> 00:11:49,310
Look, Ted, you're married.
You know what it's like.

197
00:11:49,311 --> 00:11:52,310
You take a call from a woman after
ten o'clock at night,

198
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:55,310
God help you if you don't say what
it was about. Am I right?

199
00:11:55,311 --> 00:11:56,310
Yes, that's right, sir.

200
00:11:56,311 --> 00:11:59,311
Well, I'm divorced, sir.
Now I know why.

201
00:12:01,311 --> 00:12:04,310
Exactly. I told my wife it was
a work call, nothing more.

202
00:12:04,311 --> 00:12:08,310
Obviously, if you need
to take this further,
I'm completely at your disposal.

203
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,310
Whatever it takes to get those
bastards, right, Ted?

204
00:12:10,311 --> 00:12:12,310
Thank you, sir.

205
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:15,310
Sir, the call from DI Denton?

206
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:17,310
Was that your first
contact with her?

207
00:12:17,311 --> 00:12:19,310
What d'you mean?

208
00:12:19,311 --> 00:12:21,311
Did you know her at all, sir?

209
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,310
Look, Kate, I think we're really
obliged to operate within

210
00:12:28,311 --> 00:12:31,310
the parameters of the Reg 15
notice that we served

211
00:12:31,311 --> 00:12:33,310
and any other lines of enquiry
really have to be

212
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:37,310
submitted in writing to Deputy Chief
Constable Dryden and the ACPO.

213
00:12:37,311 --> 00:12:39,310
Fine.

214
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:40,310
Correct, sir?

215
00:12:40,311 --> 00:12:43,310
Quite right, Hastings.
Thank you, sir.

216
00:12:43,311 --> 00:12:47,311
Once again apologies
for troubling you, sir. Sure.

217
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:51,310
Sir?

218
00:12:51,311 --> 00:12:52,310
Ted?

219
00:12:52,311 --> 00:12:55,310
My team, you know, sir, they're
young, they're keen. It's fine.

220
00:12:55,311 --> 00:12:58,310
I hope you realise why
this was necessary.
Nobody can appear above...

221
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,310
Ted, it's fine.

222
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:04,310
It's just that I would be mortified
if you thought that I wasn't
grateful for your support, sir.

223
00:13:04,311 --> 00:13:07,310
Never crossed my mind.

224
00:13:07,311 --> 00:13:08,311
Keep up the good work.

225
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:40,310
Sir? I've listed the questions
that remain unanswered
in regard to Dryden,

226
00:13:40,311 --> 00:13:42,310
if he approved the lack of back-up,
firearms, changing the rota

227
00:13:42,311 --> 00:13:45,310
to put Denton on duty, his alleged
relationship with her...

228
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:48,310
Look, the gaffer's said we've
to be careful about what we say.

229
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:52,310
What, that explains your stand-up
routine? Yeah, well, there's more
than one way to skin a cat.

230
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:54,310
I don't remember saying, "Come in."

231
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:56,311
Sir.

232
00:13:58,311 --> 00:14:01,310
It's all right, Steve,
you did a grand job.

233
00:14:01,311 --> 00:14:03,310
I need clarification, sir.

234
00:14:03,311 --> 00:14:05,310
Will we be seeking an interview
with Mrs Dryden?

235
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,311
No, no, it's bound to be
non-evidential.

236
00:14:08,311 --> 00:14:09,310
Yes, sir.

237
00:14:09,311 --> 00:14:11,310
Sounds like a load of old
bollocks to me, anyway.

238
00:14:11,311 --> 00:14:13,310
Why would he lie to
incriminate himself?

239
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:16,310
If anything he'd dodge it
and then put it on his missus.

240
00:14:16,311 --> 00:14:20,310
Well, I think we're getting a deeper
insight into why Dot's divorced.

241
00:14:20,311 --> 00:14:23,310
Why don't we just close
the whole thing, shall we?

242
00:14:23,311 --> 00:14:25,310
Dump it back on Traffic.
Yes, sir.

243
00:14:25,311 --> 00:14:27,310
And the alleged relationship
with Denton?

244
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:31,310
Are we seeking evidence? I thought
she said it was over, Steve?

245
00:14:31,311 --> 00:14:35,310
With respect, sir,
it connects Denton to the person
she alleges set her up.

246
00:14:35,311 --> 00:14:38,310
Can we just not be saying
career-ending stuff like that out loud?

247
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,310
Yeah, yeah. OK, OK.

248
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:45,310
All right, Steve,
seek corroboration.

249
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:49,310
But remember we're dealing with
somebody's marriage here.

250
00:14:49,311 --> 00:14:50,310
Sir.

251
00:14:50,311 --> 00:14:52,311
Sir. Sir.

252
00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:05,311
What's she doing next door?

253
00:15:06,311 --> 00:15:08,311
Move away from the door.

254
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:15,311
What happened to the other two?

255
00:15:26,311 --> 00:15:30,311
For your own safety,
you'll exercise alone.

256
00:16:05,311 --> 00:16:09,311
What if Dryden was trying to create an alibi
for the night of the driving offence...

257
00:16:11,311 --> 00:16:14,310
OK...

258
00:16:14,311 --> 00:16:17,310
Request his electronic diary
and access to his work emails.

259
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:19,472
Find out what his official
movements were that day. OK.

260
00:16:24,311 --> 00:16:25,311
DC Fleming...

261
00:16:27,311 --> 00:16:29,311
Thank you.

262
00:16:30,311 --> 00:16:33,311
What? Major Violent Crime
have arrested Rich Akers.

263
00:16:35,311 --> 00:16:38,310
Your late wife, DS Jayne Akers,

264
00:16:38,311 --> 00:16:41,310
why was there a dramatic
change in her financial situation

265
00:16:41,311 --> 00:16:43,311
in the month leading up
to her death?

266
00:16:44,311 --> 00:16:47,311
I don't know what you're
referring to.

267
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:51,310
Here's a breakdown obtained
by our Financial Forensics Unit.

268
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:56,310
It shows her financial activity
over the last six months.

269
00:16:56,311 --> 00:17:00,310
For the first five months,
there's a consistent pattern
of debits to the account,

270
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:04,310
cash card withdrawals, goods and
services using the associated

271
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:07,310
debit cards.
Then, suddenly, it stops dead.

272
00:17:07,311 --> 00:17:12,310
No cashpoint withdrawals.
No debit card payments.

273
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:15,310
It's as if your wife miraculously
stopped spending any money.

274
00:17:15,311 --> 00:17:17,310
Or needing any.

275
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,310
Uh... OK.

276
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:21,310
We see this sort of pattern

277
00:17:21,311 --> 00:17:23,311
when a person resorts to
paying their way in cash.

278
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:26,311
OK.

279
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:31,310
Do you recognise this bank
statement,

280
00:17:31,311 --> 00:17:33,311
also obtained by our FFU?

281
00:17:36,311 --> 00:17:37,310
My bank account.

282
00:17:37,311 --> 00:17:40,310
You haven't made a single cashpoint
withdrawal in over six weeks.

283
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:43,310
There's barely an item
paid for by card.

284
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:46,311
Don't you need the money either?

285
00:17:47,311 --> 00:17:49,310
Well, I wasn't earning.

286
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,311
So that I knew
I had to tighten my belt.

287
00:17:53,311 --> 00:17:56,311
A team conducted
a search of your property today.

288
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:01,310
Your client was under arrest,
hence the search was authorised

289
00:18:01,311 --> 00:18:04,311
under Section 18(1)1 of the
Police And Criminal Evidence Act.

290
00:18:07,311 --> 00:18:10,311
This case was found hidden
under the floorboards.

291
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:14,311
It contained £20,000 in cash.

292
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:18,310
24 hours...

293
00:18:18,311 --> 00:18:19,310
He's going nowhere.

294
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:20,311
Twat.

295
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,310
It's not your fault, mate.

296
00:18:25,311 --> 00:18:28,310
They got hold of the financial
forensics, that's all.

297
00:18:28,311 --> 00:18:30,310
Yeah.

298
00:18:30,311 --> 00:18:32,311
So, where did it come from?

299
00:18:34,311 --> 00:18:35,351
I've never seen it before.

300
00:18:37,311 --> 00:18:39,310
Never saw your wife with it?

301
00:18:39,311 --> 00:18:41,310
I said I've never seen it before.

302
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:44,310
Your wife, she was taking bribes,
wasn't she? No.

303
00:18:44,311 --> 00:18:46,310
I thought you said you didn't ask!
Well, I...

304
00:18:46,311 --> 00:18:49,310
It must've been pretty obvious
something was going on.

305
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:51,310
You didn't ask where
this cash was coming from? No.

306
00:18:51,311 --> 00:18:54,311
Why not? I just didn't.

307
00:18:57,311 --> 00:19:01,310
Richard Akers, the evidence obtained
in our investigation

308
00:19:01,311 --> 00:19:04,310
is being forwarded to the
Crown Prosecution Service.

309
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:09,310
We charge you under Section 329(1)
of the Proceeds Of Crime Act

310
00:19:09,311 --> 00:19:14,310
and that you acquired, used, or
had possession of criminal property,

311
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:18,310
namely funds received by your
wife as part of conspiracy

312
00:19:18,311 --> 00:19:20,311
to murder a protected witness.

313
00:19:23,311 --> 00:19:25,311
Interview terminated.

314
00:19:43,311 --> 00:19:45,310
The fact is you had the same
evidence we had,

315
00:19:45,311 --> 00:19:49,310
only we acted, didn't we?

316
00:19:49,311 --> 00:19:51,311
You didn't.

317
00:19:58,311 --> 00:20:00,310
Kate...

318
00:20:00,311 --> 00:20:03,310
It's bad enough already,
behave yourself.

319
00:20:03,311 --> 00:20:05,311
Yeah.

320
00:20:09,311 --> 00:20:11,310
DS Arnott, AC-12.

321
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:14,310
We've been given authorisation
by the Custody Officer

322
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:16,311
to conduct an intelligence
interview, off tape.

323
00:20:18,311 --> 00:20:20,310
It's fine.

324
00:20:20,311 --> 00:20:22,311
OK.

325
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:31,310
Bastard.

326
00:20:31,311 --> 00:20:33,311
Holier than thou doesn't suit you,
Kate.

327
00:20:35,311 --> 00:20:37,310
You never turned a blind eye?

328
00:20:37,311 --> 00:20:40,310
Benefited from one?

329
00:20:40,311 --> 00:20:42,310
This lot,
they're going to crucify Jayne,

330
00:20:42,311 --> 00:20:44,311
whether they get the facts or not.

331
00:20:49,311 --> 00:20:51,311
Who's out there? No-one.

332
00:20:57,311 --> 00:21:00,310
She kept records.

333
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:01,310
Hidden.

334
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,311
Records of what?

335
00:21:05,311 --> 00:21:07,310
Her last case.

336
00:21:07,311 --> 00:21:10,310
The protected
witness who got killed.

337
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:14,310
I believe she wanted leverage
against the criminal parties
she was dealing with.

338
00:21:14,311 --> 00:21:16,311
These records. Where are they now?

339
00:21:22,311 --> 00:21:23,311
On flash drives.

340
00:21:27,311 --> 00:21:29,311
I put them all in a Jiffy bag.

341
00:21:31,311 --> 00:21:34,311
I set up a PO Box,
sent them all to it.

342
00:21:55,311 --> 00:21:57,311
Thank you.

343
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:38,310
Look, I'm sorry.
I have to work late again.

344
00:22:38,311 --> 00:22:41,311
You must think I'm some
sort of idiot.

345
00:22:44,311 --> 00:22:47,311
Step away from the door.

346
00:22:57,311 --> 00:22:59,311
Come in.

347
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:04,310
Hello, Lindsay, I'm Fiona.

348
00:23:04,311 --> 00:23:06,311
Please sit down.

349
00:23:13,311 --> 00:23:16,310
I have some bad news for you.

350
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:19,310
This morning I took at call
from the Ashcliffe Nursing Home.

351
00:23:19,311 --> 00:23:22,311
In the early hours your mother
suffered a very severe stroke.

352
00:23:23,311 --> 00:23:26,310
She's very poorly.

353
00:23:26,311 --> 00:23:28,310
I'm very sorry.

354
00:23:28,311 --> 00:23:32,310
Erm, how's she doing now?

355
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:34,311
They're keeping her comfortable.

356
00:23:37,311 --> 00:23:41,310
There's a geriatrician, Dr Panesar.
Yes, he's seen her.

357
00:23:41,311 --> 00:23:44,310
They've decided not to transfer her,
as she's DNR.

358
00:23:44,311 --> 00:23:47,311
'Not For Resuscitation.'
I signed the order.

359
00:23:51,311 --> 00:23:55,311
Please accept our sympathies
at this very difficult time.

360
00:23:57,311 --> 00:24:00,311
I am available to you
as your Personal Wellbeing Officer.

361
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:05,310
I can also arrange an appointment
with our Chaplaincy Service.

362
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:07,311
Wouldn't I see a homeopath
while I'm at it?

363
00:24:08,311 --> 00:24:12,311
Are you being very sarcastic
or would you like me
to contact a homeopath?

364
00:24:13,311 --> 00:24:15,311
I just want to see my mum.

365
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:28,310
You were involved in a disturbance

366
00:24:28,311 --> 00:24:31,310
and you've self-harmed.
I was attacked.

367
00:24:31,311 --> 00:24:34,310
I can only go on what they've
recorded in your file.

368
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:36,311
And that means that
I can't see my mum?

369
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:40,311
It's up to the Governor.

370
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:57,311
Kate... Jayne Akers flash drives.

371
00:24:59,311 --> 00:25:00,311
Go for it.

372
00:25:04,311 --> 00:25:07,310
We've prioritised the stuff dated
in the run-up to the ambush.

373
00:25:07,311 --> 00:25:11,310
"T incensed by August 9th
statement." T... Tommy.

374
00:25:11,311 --> 00:25:15,310
Right, let's see who was saying
what on August 9th, yeah?

375
00:25:15,311 --> 00:25:19,310
OK. "Need to reassure him about his
immunity from prosecution."

376
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:24,310
"If SH compromised require quick
TX." Safe House. Transfer.

377
00:25:24,311 --> 00:25:27,310
"Contact made." Contact with who?

378
00:25:27,311 --> 00:25:29,310
Denton, maybe? Can't be.

379
00:25:29,311 --> 00:25:32,310
This is from before the night of
the ambush, before Akers called her.

380
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:35,310
No further entries to say who she
made contact with.

381
00:25:35,311 --> 00:25:36,311
Steve.

382
00:25:47,311 --> 00:25:49,311
24 hours, son, that's what you said.

383
00:25:51,311 --> 00:25:53,310
I messed up, boss.

384
00:25:53,311 --> 00:25:55,310
No excuses.

385
00:25:55,311 --> 00:25:59,310
Steve, you and I have had our
differences,

386
00:25:59,311 --> 00:26:04,311
but they're a damn sight easier to
overlook if the job's being done.

387
00:26:51,311 --> 00:26:54,310
It was Hargreaves' decision to make
the arrest.

388
00:26:54,311 --> 00:26:56,311
I argued the toss, for what it's
worth.

389
00:27:01,311 --> 00:27:03,311
OK. Wait.

390
00:27:07,311 --> 00:27:09,311
You want a beer?

391
00:27:12,311 --> 00:27:14,311
Yeah.

392
00:27:27,311 --> 00:27:30,310
You've got every right to be pissed
off. No shit?

393
00:27:30,311 --> 00:27:33,310
When you said you thought Richard
Akers was hiding something...

394
00:27:33,311 --> 00:27:36,310
I didn't say run financial forensics
on him.

395
00:27:36,311 --> 00:27:39,310
It's my job. What, to drop me in it
with my boss?

396
00:27:39,311 --> 00:27:41,310
I got you access to the hospital
car park CCTV,

397
00:27:41,311 --> 00:27:44,310
to the crime scene on the industrial
estate.

398
00:27:44,311 --> 00:27:47,310
I just took it to be a bit of, you
know, you-scratch-my-back.

399
00:27:47,311 --> 00:27:49,310
That came later.

400
00:27:49,311 --> 00:27:53,311
Yeah. Well, I'm glad I didn't have
to point that out.

401
00:27:56,311 --> 00:27:59,310
Anyway, that's all I came to say,
so...

402
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:01,311
You don't have to go.

403
00:28:09,311 --> 00:28:13,311
You and me, we just... we just want
to get the job done.

404
00:28:15,311 --> 00:28:18,310
It's pretty hard to set that aside.

405
00:28:18,311 --> 00:28:19,311
Yeah.

406
00:28:22,311 --> 00:28:24,310
I'm not saying... this is over.

407
00:28:24,311 --> 00:28:26,310
On hold?

408
00:28:26,311 --> 00:28:28,311
Yeah.

409
00:28:35,311 --> 00:28:38,311
My non-work number for when this is
all over.

410
00:28:40,311 --> 00:28:42,310
Good luck getting the job done.

411
00:28:42,311 --> 00:28:44,311
You, too.

412
00:29:04,311 --> 00:29:06,311
DS Arnott, AC-12.

413
00:29:10,311 --> 00:29:12,310
Just a moment, please.

414
00:29:12,311 --> 00:29:14,310
It's all right, I've sorted the
paperwork.

415
00:29:14,311 --> 00:29:19,310
How'd you find out about this place?
I've been working flat out.

416
00:29:19,311 --> 00:29:21,311
This way.

417
00:29:24,311 --> 00:29:26,310
These are the vehicles from the
crime scene.

418
00:29:26,311 --> 00:29:29,310
They were analysed in situ till the
6th of September,

419
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:31,311
then sent to us for storage.

420
00:29:33,311 --> 00:29:37,310
This is the vehicle registered to
DS Akers? The very one.

421
00:29:37,311 --> 00:29:39,310
Everything's as was?

422
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:41,310
With the exception of items

423
00:29:41,311 --> 00:29:43,310
recovered from on or inside the
vehicle.

424
00:29:43,311 --> 00:29:44,311
Where are they?

425
00:29:49,311 --> 00:29:51,310
Here.

426
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:54,310
I've got an inventory of the items
held in evidence. We'll need to see it.

427
00:29:54,311 --> 00:29:58,311
I'll print you out a copy. And we'll
need to inspect the evidence ourselves.

428
00:30:01,311 --> 00:30:02,311
Thanks.

429
00:30:24,311 --> 00:30:26,311
You ever seen one of these before?

430
00:30:28,311 --> 00:30:31,310
I used one when I worked in
Counter-Terror. What is it?

431
00:30:31,311 --> 00:30:33,311
A tracking device.

432
00:30:34,311 --> 00:30:36,310
What the hell are you up to?!

433
00:30:36,311 --> 00:30:38,310
How long you been sitting on this?
Get out!

434
00:30:38,311 --> 00:30:43,310
It's a private facility, you've got
no jurisdiction here. Him... out.

435
00:30:43,311 --> 00:30:46,310
I've already presented you with
a warrant to search these premises,

436
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,310
any obstruction of me and my
colleague and you'll be arrested

437
00:30:48,311 --> 00:30:51,310
for obstructing a police officer in
the lawful execution of their duty.

438
00:30:51,311 --> 00:30:53,311
Do you mind just giving us a minute,
please?

439
00:30:57,311 --> 00:31:01,310
There was a lump on that car. Oh,
all of a sudden you've become a detective.

440
00:31:01,311 --> 00:31:03,310
When did you find it? Day one?

441
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:06,310
You want to wind your neck in, son. We were
investigating Denton and the whole time

442
00:31:06,311 --> 00:31:10,310
it didn't matter what route she took that
night, the ambushers were tracking Akers!

443
00:31:10,311 --> 00:31:13,310
Well, nobody made you pin it on
Denton, did they?

444
00:31:13,311 --> 00:31:16,310
You arseholes managed that all by
yourselves.

445
00:31:16,311 --> 00:31:18,310
We've got what we came for, Steve.

446
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:19,632
Let's leave it at that, shall we?

447
00:31:23,311 --> 00:31:25,311
Sir.

448
00:31:31,311 --> 00:31:32,311
Lock it.

449
00:31:44,311 --> 00:31:47,311
Move away from the door.

450
00:32:02,311 --> 00:32:05,310
You'll be escorted off the premises
today.

451
00:32:05,311 --> 00:32:08,310
And how long will I have with my
mum?

452
00:32:08,311 --> 00:32:10,310
The Governor hasn't given her
approval.

453
00:32:10,311 --> 00:32:14,311
This is a Production Order... to
attend a police interview.

454
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:18,310
Returning to the night of the
ambush,

455
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:22,310
the only officer you disclosed the
operation to was who?

456
00:32:22,311 --> 00:32:24,310
Deputy Chief Constable Mike Dryden.

457
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:27,310
DCC Dryden corroborates receiving
your call.

458
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:29,311
Good.

459
00:32:30,311 --> 00:32:35,310
Was DCC Dryden known to you in
purely a professional capacity?

460
00:32:35,311 --> 00:32:37,310
No... it went beyond that.

461
00:32:37,311 --> 00:32:40,310
This alleged relationship with
Deputy Chief Constable Dryden...

462
00:32:40,311 --> 00:32:44,311
Alleged? Describe this alleged
relationship.

463
00:32:46,109 --> 00:32:49,310
It began when we worked in Crime Audit
together and ended a couple of months ago.

464
00:32:49,311 --> 00:32:53,311
And how did it end? He didn't leave
his wife.

465
00:32:55,311 --> 00:32:58,310
He made promises, is that right?

466
00:32:58,311 --> 00:33:00,310
Yeah.

467
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,310
What kind?

468
00:33:02,311 --> 00:33:05,310
That he would leave his wife.
God give me strength!

469
00:33:05,311 --> 00:33:10,310
The issue here is that an allegation
has been put forward by you, DI Denton,

470
00:33:10,311 --> 00:33:13,310
that somehow the Deputy Chief
Constable has set you up

471
00:33:13,311 --> 00:33:16,310
to take the blame for the ambush that
happened on the night of September 5th.

472
00:33:16,311 --> 00:33:19,310
Now is that about the top and the
bottom of it?

473
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:22,311
Honestly, sir, I don't know.

474
00:33:24,311 --> 00:33:27,310
And you wouldn't have anything to
substantiate this theory?

475
00:33:27,311 --> 00:33:31,310
I mean, a little thing called
"evidence".

476
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:33,310
Or is that too much to ask?

477
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:36,310
I resent your tone, Superintendent
Hastings.

478
00:33:36,311 --> 00:33:38,311
She resents my tone.

479
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:43,310
If there's been a relationship,
we'll require corroboration.

480
00:33:43,311 --> 00:33:45,310
Did you ever go to his home?

481
00:33:45,311 --> 00:33:49,310
No, he came to mine. Witnesses?
I doubt it. We were very discreet.

482
00:33:49,311 --> 00:33:51,310
Hotels?

483
00:33:51,311 --> 00:33:55,310
We visited a place a few times,
I've submitted the details for you.

484
00:33:55,311 --> 00:33:59,310
Well, most places, they insist on a
credit card imprint when you check in.

485
00:33:59,311 --> 00:34:02,310
Mike insisted on using mine and then
he gave me cash.

486
00:34:02,311 --> 00:34:04,310
So he never used his? Not that I
recall.

487
00:34:04,311 --> 00:34:08,310
Did he make calls from there on his
mobile or the room phone? Yeah.

488
00:34:08,311 --> 00:34:12,310
Good. We'll find out if any of the
staff remember both of you being there.

489
00:34:12,311 --> 00:34:15,310
See the thing is, DI Denton,

490
00:34:15,311 --> 00:34:18,310
that the more intricate this
investigation becomes,

491
00:34:18,311 --> 00:34:21,310
the easier it is for you to try and
confound my team.

492
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:23,310
But me, I've been round the block a
few times,

493
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,310
I really don't care if you and the
DCC were swinging off the chandeliers,

494
00:34:26,311 --> 00:34:29,310
that does not make him a
conspirator.

495
00:34:29,311 --> 00:34:33,310
And you maintain that you've never
heard of the protected witness. I haven't.

496
00:34:33,311 --> 00:34:36,310
And that you've never even met Akers
before? No.

497
00:34:36,311 --> 00:34:38,310
And yet one phone call from Akers

498
00:34:38,311 --> 00:34:41,310
and you are up to your neck in all
her dodgy business.

499
00:34:41,311 --> 00:34:44,311
Because I'm a police officer and she
needed my help.

500
00:34:46,311 --> 00:34:48,310
Did you request approval from DCC
Dryden

501
00:34:48,311 --> 00:34:51,310
to proceed without back-up and
without firearms?

502
00:34:51,311 --> 00:34:52,310
I did.

503
00:34:52,311 --> 00:34:57,310
With no recording, it's your word
against his, isn't it... DI Denton?

504
00:34:57,311 --> 00:34:59,311
My word is I did.

505
00:35:03,311 --> 00:35:06,310
You know what, if you've been around
the block a few times, sir,

506
00:35:06,311 --> 00:35:09,310
then you tell me, have you found
anything lately

507
00:35:09,311 --> 00:35:11,311
which makes me appear guilty?

508
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:16,310
Anything? Or is it starting
to look like

509
00:35:16,311 --> 00:35:18,311
you might just have the wrong
person?

510
00:35:20,311 --> 00:35:25,310
Ma'am, all the information gleaned
from our post-charge investigation,
it's going to the CPS. Good.

511
00:35:25,311 --> 00:35:28,391
Then it won't be long before they realise
there's no credible case against me.

512
00:35:31,311 --> 00:35:35,310
Look, my mum is very ill... and as
I've cooperated,

513
00:35:35,311 --> 00:35:37,310
I would appreciate any good word to
the Governor

514
00:35:37,311 --> 00:35:40,311
that might persuade her to permit me
a visit. Please.

515
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:47,311
We can look into that.

516
00:35:49,311 --> 00:35:51,310
OK, we've found something on the
flash drives.

517
00:35:51,311 --> 00:35:53,311
Do you want to take a seat?

518
00:35:55,311 --> 00:35:56,311
Can you play it?

519
00:35:58,311 --> 00:36:00,311
"Is this bloody thing on or what?"

520
00:36:02,311 --> 00:36:04,310
"We had a deal."

521
00:36:04,311 --> 00:36:08,310
"Immunity from prosecution, you
two-faced bastard!"

522
00:36:08,311 --> 00:36:12,310
"Does this bastard think I won't
Which bastard?"

523
00:36:12,311 --> 00:36:14,310
"They're all at it. You show them
this,

524
00:36:14,311 --> 00:36:16,310
"then they'll know who they're
dealing with."

525
00:36:16,311 --> 00:36:20,310
"Police officers? Aye, from the
two-faced bastard,

526
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,310
"right down to the Caddy."

527
00:36:22,311 --> 00:36:24,310
"The Caddy?"

528
00:36:24,311 --> 00:36:26,310
"He's been one of us since he was a
wee laddie."

529
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:31,310
"He's been doing a job on the inside
for years and years now."

530
00:36:31,311 --> 00:36:35,310
"What are you going to do? Oh,
you'll find out soon enough."

531
00:36:35,311 --> 00:36:39,311
"And then it will all come out...
unless this immunity is sorted."

532
00:36:40,311 --> 00:36:42,311
"We had a deal!"

533
00:36:45,311 --> 00:36:48,310
Right, that was recorded a week
before the ambush.

534
00:36:48,311 --> 00:36:50,310
Proves he was stressed about his
immunity.

535
00:36:50,311 --> 00:36:52,310
Who's the two-faced bastard?

536
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:53,310
Play it.

537
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:57,310
The 9th of August statement
previously mentioned.

538
00:36:57,311 --> 00:36:59,310
Resources are incredibly stretched,

539
00:36:59,311 --> 00:37:03,310
yet certain police forces and the
courts

540
00:37:03,311 --> 00:37:07,310
collude in granting immunity from
prosecution to individuals

541
00:37:07,311 --> 00:37:10,310
I'd describe as repugnant offenders,

542
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:15,310
men and women who cost the taxpayer
millions of pounds, year on year,

543
00:37:15,311 --> 00:37:16,310
while any right-thinking person

544
00:37:16,311 --> 00:37:19,310
would demand they face justice for
their crimes.

545
00:37:19,311 --> 00:37:22,310
"Repugnant offender." I couldn't
have put it better myself.

546
00:37:22,311 --> 00:37:26,311
Deputy Chief Constable Dryden,
Tommy's "two-faced bastard".

547
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,311
It was Dryden turning the screws on
Tommy.

548
00:37:31,311 --> 00:37:33,311
What about this other officer, the
Caddy?

549
00:37:37,311 --> 00:37:42,310
Mind if I look into that, sir?
Yes, off you go, Dot, thanks.

550
00:37:42,311 --> 00:37:43,311
Thanks.

551
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:47,310
Anything else on the files comes up
about this Caddy,

552
00:37:47,311 --> 00:37:50,310
shoot it over to my computer, yeah?
Ta. OK.

553
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:53,310
If Tommy did have something on
Dryden...

554
00:37:53,311 --> 00:37:55,310
That's a hell of a motive for Dryden
to orchestrate the hit,

555
00:37:55,311 --> 00:37:57,311
and keep it from coming out.

556
00:37:58,311 --> 00:38:00,311
Lindsay was set up.

557
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:37,311
Steve.

558
00:38:40,311 --> 00:38:42,311
Lindsay's phone records.

559
00:38:46,311 --> 00:38:48,311
Come in.

560
00:38:51,311 --> 00:38:53,310
There are numerous calls in Denton's
phone records

561
00:38:53,311 --> 00:38:56,310
to and from Deputy Chief Constable
Dryden.

562
00:38:56,311 --> 00:39:00,310
The last was on the evening of 16th
August from Dryden's mobile to hers.

563
00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:04,310
I've got the manager of the hotel confirming
that Denton and Dryden were semi-regulars.

564
00:39:04,311 --> 00:39:06,310
Double room, sometimes not even
staying the full night.

565
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:11,311
Next step, we'd like you to sign off
on requests to access Dryden's phone
and financial records, please, sir.

566
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:17,311
Well, there it is plain as day... the
man's an adulterer.

567
00:39:18,311 --> 00:39:21,311
Some people, you wonder if they've
no shame.

568
00:39:23,311 --> 00:39:27,311
Oh, well... one for the morning.
Good work, you two.

569
00:39:28,311 --> 00:39:31,310
You sure, sir? It's looking like
Dryden's involved in the ambush.

570
00:39:31,311 --> 00:39:34,310
It's looking like no such thing,

571
00:39:34,311 --> 00:39:36,310
only that he had an affair with
Denton.

572
00:39:36,311 --> 00:39:38,311
One step at a time.

573
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:43,311
Yes, sir.

574
00:40:24,311 --> 00:40:26,311
Number 14, please.

575
00:40:29,311 --> 00:40:31,311
Cheers.

576
00:41:11,311 --> 00:41:13,310
Can I have these off now?

577
00:41:13,311 --> 00:41:15,310
Against regulations.

578
00:41:15,311 --> 00:41:18,310
We're all very sorry about your mum,
Lindsay. Thank you.

579
00:41:18,311 --> 00:41:20,310
I'll take you to her straightaway.

580
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,310
Can you tell me what's happened?

581
00:41:22,311 --> 00:41:25,310
A CVA. A stroke.

582
00:41:25,311 --> 00:41:27,311
She understands but she can't talk.

583
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:55,311
Mum?

584
00:41:56,311 --> 00:41:58,311
It's Lindsay.

585
00:42:13,311 --> 00:42:15,311
Thank you.

586
00:42:17,311 --> 00:42:19,311
Kasia says you can understand.

587
00:42:23,311 --> 00:42:25,311
Are you comfortable?

588
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,311
Are you in pain?

589
00:42:32,311 --> 00:42:35,311
Ring me if you need anything.

590
00:42:41,311 --> 00:42:45,311
Oh, they're just helping me
with work, Mum.

591
00:42:52,311 --> 00:42:55,310
Dryden's emails were clean but this
was from his electronic diary.

592
00:42:55,311 --> 00:43:00,310
16th August, the night of the
traffic offence, he attended a
reception at City Hall from 5pm.

593
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:03,310
According to witnesses, he left
about 7pm.

594
00:43:03,311 --> 00:43:06,310
No further engagements that evening.

595
00:43:06,311 --> 00:43:09,310
The whole rest of the night his
whereabouts are unknown.

596
00:43:09,311 --> 00:43:12,310
So what could he have needed an
alibi for?

597
00:43:12,311 --> 00:43:14,311
Run the date through the database.

598
00:43:51,311 --> 00:43:52,311
Shit!

599
00:43:59,311 --> 00:44:02,311
Fourth Street Station, please.
Missing Persons.

600
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,310
Hi, it's DC Fleming.

601
00:44:08,311 --> 00:44:13,310
I'm calling for an update on one of
your Mis-pers. Case number G103734.

602
00:44:13,311 --> 00:44:17,310
Kirk. K-I`R`K.

603
00:44:17,311 --> 00:44:19,310
Carly.

604
00:44:19,311 --> 00:44:22,310
Yeah, it's pretty straightforward,
really, I just wondered

605
00:44:22,311 --> 00:44:26,310
if there was a formal DNA match on
the body found under the Canal-side
Industrial Estate.

606
00:44:26,311 --> 00:44:29,311
Yeah, it's not coming up on
my database.

607
00:44:34,311 --> 00:44:36,311
OK. Thank you.

608
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:55,311
Just one minute.

609
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:31,311
I'm here, Mum.

610
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,311
I'm here with you.

611
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:39,310
We left everything as it was.

612
00:45:39,311 --> 00:45:41,310
That's what the police told us to
do.

613
00:45:41,311 --> 00:45:44,310
Normally, what would happen is
control samples of Carly's DNA

614
00:45:44,311 --> 00:45:47,310
would be collected from her
toothbrush or hairbrush.

615
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:49,311
That's what they did.

616
00:45:57,311 --> 00:45:59,310
I know this is only going to add to
your distress,

617
00:45:59,311 --> 00:46:02,310
but there seems to be a problem with
the samples.

618
00:46:02,311 --> 00:46:06,310
What kind of problem? Well, we're
trying to track them down and I'm
sure we'll find them,

619
00:46:06,311 --> 00:46:09,310
but the more you can tell me the
better.

620
00:46:09,311 --> 00:46:13,310
Er... a detective came to the house
and took the stuff you said,

621
00:46:13,311 --> 00:46:17,310
her toiletries, bedclothes, dirty
laundry.

622
00:46:17,311 --> 00:46:20,310
It all went in black bin bags and he
took it away.

623
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:22,310
Normal procedure is for an officer

624
00:46:22,311 --> 00:46:24,310
to be accompanied by a forensic
investigator.

625
00:46:24,311 --> 00:46:27,310
All the materials placed
into individual evidence bags

626
00:46:27,311 --> 00:46:30,310
and you'd be asked to sign a search
book.

627
00:46:30,311 --> 00:46:34,310
But we spoke to the police, they
said they were sending someone.

628
00:46:34,311 --> 00:46:39,310
You called them? Yes. No. You
remember, Tess,

629
00:46:39,311 --> 00:46:41,310
we got a call from the detective,
saying he was on his way round.

630
00:46:41,311 --> 00:46:44,310
This detective, do you remember his
name?

631
00:46:44,311 --> 00:46:48,310
Sorry. He showed his badge for a
fraction of a second. Would you
recognise him again?

632
00:46:48,311 --> 00:46:49,310
Yeah.

633
00:46:49,311 --> 00:46:51,310
Yes.

634
00:46:51,311 --> 00:46:54,311
Can you come to the station with me?
When? Now.

635
00:47:06,311 --> 00:47:07,311
Time.

636
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:11,310
I thought I could stay?

637
00:47:11,311 --> 00:47:14,310
Do you know how much
a night shift costs?

638
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:15,311
Would love the overtime.

639
00:47:16,311 --> 00:47:18,310
But what if she...?

640
00:47:18,311 --> 00:47:21,311
You have to leave. Answering only
"yes" or "no", do you understand?

641
00:47:22,311 --> 00:47:24,311
Yeah.

642
00:47:30,311 --> 00:47:32,311
It's all right, Mum.
It's just work.

643
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:38,311
I'll be back to see
you as soon as I can.

644
00:48:41,311 --> 00:48:44,310
The detective that visited
you was male?

645
00:48:44,311 --> 00:48:45,311
Yes.

646
00:48:46,311 --> 00:48:47,310
Age?

647
00:48:47,311 --> 00:48:50,310
25 to 35? 35 to 45?

648
00:48:50,311 --> 00:48:52,311
25 to 35.

649
00:48:54,311 --> 00:48:57,310
Ethnicity?
White, Afro-Caribbean, Asian?

650
00:48:57,311 --> 00:48:59,311
Asian.

651
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:10,310
CCTV of the event at City Hall
attended by Dryden

652
00:49:10,311 --> 00:49:11,310
on the night of 16th August.

653
00:49:11,311 --> 00:49:13,310
How many tapes we got?

654
00:49:13,311 --> 00:49:14,310
I got them
digitised onto a single disc.

655
00:49:14,311 --> 00:49:16,311
Brilliant.

656
00:49:18,311 --> 00:49:21,311
But why don't I ever get invited
to these dos, eh?

657
00:49:27,311 --> 00:49:28,311
There's Dryden.

658
00:49:44,311 --> 00:49:46,311
'Do you require assistance?'

659
00:49:48,311 --> 00:49:49,311
We have to go back.

660
00:49:51,311 --> 00:49:53,311
'That's not possible.'

661
00:49:54,311 --> 00:49:56,310
I can't let the last thing
I said be a lie.

662
00:49:56,311 --> 00:49:58,311
We have to go back,
I have to tell her the truth.

663
00:51:18,311 --> 00:51:20,310
What happened?

664
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:21,310
Don't do that!

665
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:22,310
Have you got a phone you can reach?

666
00:51:22,311 --> 00:51:24,311
I think so. Call the ambulance.

667
00:51:28,311 --> 00:51:30,310
Make the call.

668
00:51:30,311 --> 00:51:31,310
Make the call!

669
00:51:31,311 --> 00:51:33,311
I can't find my phone!

670
00:52:00,311 --> 00:52:01,311
Stop!

671
00:52:08,311 --> 00:52:10,311
No.

672
00:52:12,311 --> 00:52:14,310
No.

673
00:52:14,311 --> 00:52:16,311
No.

674
00:52:41,311 --> 00:52:42,311
No.

675
00:52:47,311 --> 00:52:48,311
Police.

676
00:52:50,311 --> 00:52:52,311
Police. Where are you?

677
00:52:54,311 --> 00:52:55,311
Are you OK?

678
00:53:04,311 --> 00:53:05,310
Don't be frightened.

679
00:53:05,311 --> 00:53:07,310
Please come out where we can see
you. You won't be harmed.

680
00:53:07,311 --> 00:53:09,311
She's down here.

681
00:53:10,311 --> 00:53:13,311
Police. Show yourself. Come on.

682
00:53:15,311 --> 00:53:17,311
DI Denton. Is that you, ma'am?

683
00:53:18,311 --> 00:53:21,310
We got a 999 call
from your prison officer.

684
00:53:21,311 --> 00:53:23,311
Stop.

685
00:53:24,311 --> 00:53:25,311
That's him.

686
00:53:26,311 --> 00:53:27,311
Tessa?

687
00:53:29,311 --> 00:53:30,310
I...I think so.

688
00:53:30,311 --> 00:53:33,311
I know. That's him.

689
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:37,311
See. Don't be alarmed, ma'am.

690
00:54:17,311 --> 00:54:18,311
Oh, my God.

691
00:54:24,311 --> 00:54:26,311
We'll get you somewhere safe, ma'am.

692
00:54:28,311 --> 00:54:31,310
There you go.

693
00:54:31,311 --> 00:54:32,311
Sorry to interrupt.

694
00:54:34,311 --> 00:54:38,310
Carly Kirk's mate described
her boyfriend as being Asian.

695
00:54:38,311 --> 00:54:41,311
Around mid-30s, good-looking.
Went by the name of Matt.

696
00:54:43,311 --> 00:54:46,310
Manish Prasad, he's a serving
vice officer at Polk Avenue.

697
00:54:46,311 --> 00:54:48,310
And the foster parents
identified him

698
00:54:48,311 --> 00:54:49,711
as the one who came to their house.

699
00:54:53,311 --> 00:54:55,311
And this is one of his team.

700
00:54:57,311 --> 00:54:58,311
Jeremy Cole.

701
00:55:07,311 --> 00:55:08,311
That's him.

702
00:55:10,311 --> 00:55:12,311
Georgia was killed by one of ours.

703
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:16,311
I'm sorry, Steve.

704
00:55:18,311 --> 00:55:19,310
Christ.

705
00:55:19,311 --> 00:55:22,311
We ought to take this to the gaffer.
Yes, wait.

706
00:55:25,311 --> 00:55:27,311
Er... hang on.

707
00:55:29,311 --> 00:55:31,311
Right, here goes.

708
00:55:34,311 --> 00:55:35,311
Shit!

709
00:55:40,311 --> 00:55:42,311
Right, ma'am,
we've got to take you back.

710
00:55:49,311 --> 00:55:53,311
Technically, ma'am,
you've escaped from lawful custody.

711
00:56:10,311 --> 00:56:12,310
Thanks for not cuffing me.

712
00:56:12,311 --> 00:56:14,311
It's professional courtesy.

713
00:56:16,311 --> 00:56:18,311
We need to show this to the gaffer.

714
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:23,311
Wait. Go back.

715
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:39,111
What?

716
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,119
That's Carly Kirk.

717
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,118
This isn't your vehicle.

718
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:07,118
We had some problems.
Commandeered this one.

719
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:09,118
Jump in.

720
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,118
Well, let's not do anything
that'll make me look bad.

721
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:12,118
All right, radio in, tell them

722
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:15,118
that I'm cooperating and that we're
en route to the nearest station.

723
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,119
Whatever you say, ma'am.

724
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:33,119
Please! Help me!

725

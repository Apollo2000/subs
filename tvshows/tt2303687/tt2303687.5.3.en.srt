1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,539
It's called Operation Pear Tree.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,179
Our brief was to embed
an undercover officer

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,059
within an organised crime group.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,970
Detective Sergeant John Corbett.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,219
- [Tyres burst]
- Go, go, go!

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,820
[Rapid gunfire]

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,859
- Drinks are on me, lads.
- [Laughter and cheering]

8
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,219
- Who am I talking to?
- Just answer.

9
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,939
We're tooled up, ready for
a raid. I want to plan it.

10
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,819
He believed
he was on to the top man.

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,219
- Who?
- It was just a code name.

12
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,340
H?

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,299
Hilton.
He was the senior police officer

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,619
who was running the show
for organised crime.

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,580
H, finally.

16
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,530
Well done, everybody.

17
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,979
My senior legal counsel,
Gill Biggeloe.

18
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,020
You don't mind if she sits in?

19
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,788
I'm here to ask you one more
time to sign the papers.

20
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,739
I've joined a mate's
property development business.

21
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,859
And one of our new projects
is the Kettle Bell Complex.

22
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,459
Our terms of business include

23
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,642
compensating
the original investors.

24
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,819
Detective Chief Superintendent
Hargreaves.

25
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,579
Gaffer thinks he knows the magic
words to make them talk.

26
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,180
Don't they all?

27
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,419
I'll call you.

28
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,784
By the hairs
on your chinny-chin-chin.

29
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,899
I'm just trying
to get to the truth.

30
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,899
The top brass,
they don't want me to succeed.

31
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,099
There's a bent copper running
organised crime, I'm sure of it.

32
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,219
Everything I've said is God's
honest truth. And I'll prove it.

33
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,939
But that depends if you've got
the guts to listen.

34
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:53,059
Or are you just another lap dog
for Hastings and the rest?

35
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,739
I've been developing a CHIS
who hears things about the OCG.

36
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,739
- Someone I should know about?
- No.

37
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,019
Definitely not something
to bother a DI about.

38
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,819
We'll go after
the bent bastards.

39
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,819
But once you're in,
there's no turning back.

40
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,100
Are you in?

41
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,659
KATE: KF-1 to KF-6 are a series
of images of individuals

42
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,659
known to be part of a network
of corrupt police officers.

43
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:21,388
PS Cafferty, do you see
the person who recruited you?

44
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,820
Right, lads.

45
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,700
The Eastfield Depot,

46
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,619
used by three police forces
to store

47
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,539
all the good stuff
they use in evidence -

48
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,579
drugs, cash, jewels,
precious metals,

49
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,219
proceeds of robberies.

50
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,619
It's one of the most securely
guarded facilities in the area.

51
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,619
But since we acquired
a couple of dozen

52
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,499
automatic assault rifles
from the ballistics job,

53
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,619
we've got the firepower
to get inside.

54
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,659
This is a complicated job.

55
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,420
No disrespect.

56
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,340
None taken.

57
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,419
After I came out of Altcourse,

58
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,139
I knocked up some
false documents

59
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,739
to help my brother out
with a security job in Iraq.

60
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,299
We were guarding
high-security facilities.

61
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,859
I've seen what it takes
to defend them.

62
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,739
So I know what it takes
to raid them.

63
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,299
We've got these plans
plus some basic information

64
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,339
from the AFOs
we've been using.

65
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,099
There's a routine pickup.
We've got the driver.

66
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,859
Instead of the planned pickup,

67
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,099
we hijack the empty lorry
to do our job.

68
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,059
And higher levels
of our organisation

69
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,939
have bent coppers
in their pocket.

70
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,979
You just said
we had the firepower.

71
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,379
Yeah, but hopefully
that's just for show.

72
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,979
A big shootout will bring
every copper in the area

73
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,660
out on a blue light.

74
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,620
We need time to load the lorry.

75
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,819
Best way to do that
is to get in quietly.

76
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,820
That means inside men.

77
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,779
You make the necessary contacts.

78
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,100
Bent coppers.

79
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,539
We could call her back in,
show her a range of images

80
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,659
and try and make it evidential.

81
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,751
- Sir.
- Sir.

82
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,499
Yeah. You were saying?

83
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,459
We've been following up on
a possible ID by PS Cafferty.

84
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,099
I'm glad you're getting
around to that.

85
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,739
Last time I looked,
I was still in charge here.

86
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,140
- Sir.
- Sir.

87
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,179
To be fair, sir,
the ID wasn't evidential.

88
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,099
Cafferty claims she was
recruited by a corrupt officer

89
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,659
with established links
to organised crime.

90
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,779
I was pursuing a lead,
covering all the possibilities.

91
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:31,326
Such as Cafferty's mistaken, or
she's bargaining for immunity.

92
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,099
- Jesus Christ!
- Sorry, sir.

93
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,219
That's why we held back.

94
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,979
Look, Dot's a stick
for everyone to beat us with.

95
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,979
They know he undermines
our credibility.

96
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,019
Yeah, well,
no more skulking around, OK?

97
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,059
There's no secrets in AC-12.

98
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,540
Sir.

99
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,060

[Door opens]

102
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,219
- Sorry I'm late.
- You're all right.

103
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,700
I'm early.

104
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,300
Another?

105
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,899
Well, let's wait and see

106
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,264
if we've something
to celebrate first.

107
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,806
- Yes, sir?
- Two more of those, please.

108
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,739
We can secure your investment
with a deposit payment.

109
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,779
I've got all the paperwork.

110
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,219
What's the deposit?

111
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,179
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

112
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,859
Yeah, I know. How much?

113
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,140
- 100 grand.
- [Scoffs]

114
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,259
- [Chuckles]
- Ted. Wait, wait, wait.

115
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,939
There's a way around it.

116
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,499
Part of the deal is to recoup
your original losses.

117
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,579
We can set up a loan facility
against credit you'll receive

118
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,490
when those losses are paid back.

119
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,659
Look, you've told me
your situation.

120
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,459
You've sold the family home,
you're living in a hotel room,

121
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,219
your missus is in
a poky little flat.

122
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,130
This'll put all that in reverse.

123
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,899
We're both seasoned coppers,
we've risked our lives

124
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,355
then stood all the crap
they rain down.

125
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,755
Haven't we earned a payday?

126
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,897
What do I owe you?

127
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,355
That's £17.50, please, sir.

- Any news?
- Yeah.

131
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,739
Things are falling into place.

132
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,650
I'm on to a bent copper
that can get us into Eastfield.

00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,100
OK.

136

It's me. It's John Clayton.

137

Can you hear me?

Yeah, definitely.

139
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:37,460
There's... drugs...
probably double figures.

140
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,179
Cash, bullion, jewellery,
another set of double figures.

141
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,817
Look, we're talking millions.

142
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,019
As far as the risk goes,
we can minimise that

143
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,202
by using your assets -
bent coppers.

144
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:03,148
Obviously, if you need anything
more from our end, well, then...

145
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,100
Great. Thanks.

all this info to?

Truth is... I don't know, John.

151
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,410
For my own good,
I plan to keep it that way.

152
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,619

Is he?

155
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,490
Or is he one of them?

156
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,300
It's the same thing...

...if you're bent enough.

00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,939
he best be there on the night.

Surveillance of Lisa McQueen,
the female OCG nominal,

of interest to our inquiry -

216
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,099
Pulton House
on the Borogrove Estate,

217
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,010
where McQueen
spent over an hour,

218

and Kingsgate Printing Services.

219
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:42,304
So what do we know about
this block on the Grove?

220
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,459
Six flats, all were a cash
purchase four months ago.

We're trying to trace
the owners.

an OCG would use this house -

drugs and prostitution.

with the exception of McQueen.

the nature of what occurs
at these premises.

McQueen's still carrying out
contacts,

issue here we cannot ignore.

women in that block are being

kept in modern-day slavery
to provide sexual services.

00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,139
if it wouldn't cause a bigger
stink than we have already!

475
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,379
Did you think of reporting
to your seniors?

476
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,659
Arresting John Corbett -
did that occur to you?

477
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:30,059
He claims he had to commit the
offences to maintain his cover.

478
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,859
Sir, Steve's built a rapport.

479
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,459
Corbett's the CHIS
he's been using.

480
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,979
He's enabled us to detect
Jane Cafferty's corruption,

481
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,859
apprehend Lee Banks, identify
Minkowicz and Lisa McQueen

482
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:44,139
and break up an element of
their sex-trafficking operation.

483
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:47,379
It does appear Corbett's still
on an undercover operation.

484
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,420
Appear?

485
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,379
And now he's relayed
intelligence

486
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,619
on a planned armed robbery
of the Eastfield Depot.

487
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,379
Eastfield? What's he got backing
him up there, a Panzer Division?

488
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,939
Communications with
the higher levels of the OCG

489
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,819
have been carried out
via a computer link.

490
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,939
Corbett disclosed
the robbery's been planned

491
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,099
with the collusion of
a corrupt senior police officer.

492
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,899
Any details on this officer?

493
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:11,719
No, sir, I've not been provided
with an ID.

494
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,299
Sir, this is a chance to crack
the highest-level link

495
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,939
between corrupt officers
and organised crime,

496
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,304
possibly even the top man.

497
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,940
Look...

498
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,739
if we are contemplating
collaborating with John Corbett,

499
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,740

may, I can promise you that.

about our trackers!

If you were investigating
Hargreaves, I'm guessing

742
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,139
you didn't want
to complicate things.

PC Bloom, in the early hours
of this morning, March 7th,

748
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,459
your police patrol vehicle
left the road

749
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,779
and crashed into a ditch
alongside Farmers Lane.

750
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,219
- Correct, sarge.
- In a remark made to me,

751
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,299
you suggested
oil had been put on the road.

752
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,740
That's right.

753
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:57,779
You also claimed to have
observed suspects

754
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,979
wearing balaclavas,
equipped with firearms,

755
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:02,179
as a result of which
you made a Status Zero call.

756
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,660
Yes.

757
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,779
A search of the area
found no suspects.

758
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:10,299
They must have fled
when the cavalry arrived.

759
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,340
OK, makes sense.

760
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:15,179
And we didfind oil on the road.

762
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:24,939
Great. So everything
checks out, then.

763
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:27,819
Please refer to Document 15
in your folder.

764
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:30,099
This is a forensic report
on chemical samples

taken from PC Bloom's hands.

766
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,339
You'll see from Document 15

767
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:36,739
that minute traces of oil were
detected on PC Bloom's hands.

of the oil detected on the road

and the oil
detected on PC Bloom.

771
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:46,699
Spectrographic analysis
gives a 99.5% probability

772
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:48,459
that the oil
detected on the road

773
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:50,379
and the oil detected
on PC Bloom's hands

774
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:53,471
came from the same
original source.

775
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,499
You crashed the patrol car,

776
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:59,259
then put oil on the road
to make it look like an ambush.

777
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:01,339
PC Bloom,
I've been in consultation

778
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,499
with the Crown Prosecutor
regarding a charge

779
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:06,219
of Conspiracy to Commit
Armed Robbery.

780
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:11,499
Your best option right now is
to tell us who put you up to it.

[Whispers] I'm afraid
you don't have any choice.

DCS Hargreaves.

783
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:33,395
What was the purpose
of the fake Status Zero call?

784
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,299
Hargreaves said
that he had to be in the area

785
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:40,020
at a certain time.

786
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:43,606
The Status Zero call
gave him an excuse.

787
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:47,579

investigators carried out

and they detected
a small freezer in the back.

790
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:57,210
Inside the freezer,
they found used condoms.

791
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,939
Can you tell me
why that might be?

792
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:03,122
[Translates
into Mariana's language]

793
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:17,850
[She speaks her native language]

794
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:25,339
Some of the men
they made me have sex with,

795
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:28,613
they told us
always keep the condoms.

796
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,619
Did this order apply to the man

797
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:36,979
you told me you saw with Lisa
McQueen on 4th March?

798
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:39,500
[Translator asks question]

799
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:47,100
TRANSLATOR: Yes.

800
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,659
DS Arnott, AC-12.

801
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,699
I need a custody cell
for a police constable

802
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,299
at a station he isn't known at.

803
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,780
Decker Avenue.

804
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,220
Great. Thanks.

805
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,779
You call me back
when you've got confirmation?

806
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,300
Yeah, thanks.

807
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,900
I heard. Nice one.

808
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:10,459
Any explanation on
where the leak came from

809
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:13,180
- about the trackers?
- No.

810
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:15,739
Looks like Hargreaves
made an educated guess.

811
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:17,540
How's yours gone?

812
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,779
The trafficked girl alleges
they were ordered

813
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,619
to harvest DNA
with certain clients -

814
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,659
used condoms
kept in cold storage.

815
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,979
Same blackmail MO
they've used before -

816
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:27,979
capturing DNA
to plant at a crime scene.

817
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:30,219
Mm. Possibly Hargreaves
was being blackmailed

818
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,979
into conspiring in the robbery,
and he was forced to be there

819
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:35,459
as security against
double-crossing the OCG.

820
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,339
Hence the Status Zero call.

821
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,059
A cover story
in case he was spotted

822
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,219
and had to explain
why he was near the robbery.

823
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,299
The only problem
with the Status Zero call,

824
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,482
meant we couldn't
apprehend the OCG.

825
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,300
The Gaffer had no choice.

826
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:51,179
Preservation of life.

827
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,500
Yeah, he had no choice.

828
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,779
Sir, we've reached threshold
on Hargreaves.

829
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,619
We need the trafficked girl
to ID him

830
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,659
as soon as he's well enough.

831
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:03,500
Sir?

832
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,739
The hospital just called.

Detective Chief Superintendent
Hargreaves

[Low chatter]

837
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,740
Hi, Gill.

838
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,659
I was worried
I was being stood up.

839
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:49,979
Yeah. No, I'm sorry about that.

840
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,180
Sorry.

841
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:52,899
I found a way to pass the time.

842

- Join me?

Yeah, erm... Oh, thanks.

Can I have a whisky, please?
One piece of ice.

845
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,959
Yes, of course, sir.

846
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,340
Yeah.

847
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:10,980
How would you characterise
AC-12's endeavours

848
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:16,380
to apprehend
a dangerously unpredictable UCO?

849
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:22,922
I would say
that we've been unlucky.

850
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:24,460
Yeah.

851
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,780
And we're failing.

852
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:31,184
Well, not everyone agrees.

853
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:33,260
No?

854
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:36,664
Some say
it's just you that's failing.

855
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,819
I'm not one of them, obviously.

856
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:41,180
Right.

857
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,860
Ted, I'm on your side.

858
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:49,939
I don't want this
to end badly for you.

859
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,499
I don't want the fiasco
of Operation Pear Tree,

860
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,219
which was not of your making,

861
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:59,493
add a disastrous coda to an
otherwise distinguished career.

What are you saying?

863

You've always put your team,

your principles, first.

Maybe the time's come
to look after number one.

866
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:20,939
How come I've got
the sneaking suspicion

867
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:23,339
that we're talking about
early retirement here?

868
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:26,779
You're flattering yourself,
using the adjective "early".

to nick the bent bastard!

- What? He's dead?
- What do you expect

when you unload
an automatic rifle at someone?

892
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:49,660
No, I... I aimed low,

893
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:52,099
to wound...
so he wouldn't get away...

894
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,899
so you'd have him
for questioning.

895

Where were you
when I needed you?

realise that was a diversion?

Look, Steve, don't you get it?

901

He pulled you out so we could
get away with the gear.

calling all the shots. He's H!

for the murder of Lester Har...

to kill Hargreaves...

...but now I have,
I've crossed the line.

a long while back.

to keep my cover...

to talk inside?

1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,290
So many years I wondered what
I'd do if I ever saw him again

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,090
and then I did, in a
photo, in a briefing room

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,080
and I was being sent
to meet him with a gun.

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,330
I don't think we should close

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,610
the investigation into
Danny Waldron's background.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,860
I'd like to keep digging.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,020
What's he saying?

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,210
This man's a young Ronan Murphy,

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,810
a suspect shot by Daniel
Waldron during Operation Damson.

10
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,010
What, they knew each other?

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,370
Did you fabricate the
improper relations between you

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,130
- and Detective Sergeant Arnott? - No.

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,180
- Did you fabricate the planting
of evidence against you? - No.

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,970
What is your verdict?

15
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,170
Not guilty.

16
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,210
It is with deep regret
that I inform you all

17
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,600
of the death of PC Rod Kennedy.

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,970
Hari initiated the struggle with that gun

19
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,520
and it's only his word for
it that it was self-defence.

20
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,610
I owe you an apology for the other night.

21
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,450
Your, erm, dinner invitation.

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,460
- You're a married man.
- This is it.

23
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,530
I think Danny Waldron purposely
created a trail of evidence

24
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,970
and now we're on the trail
of the other abusers.

25
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,250
Dale Roach.

26
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,050
He was leader of the city council
during the period Danny Waldron

27
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,530
and Joe Nash were residents at Sands View.

28
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,650
The things that he did
to us at Sands View...

29
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,500
I promise you, I will get these bastards.

30
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,490
Bains killed Danny. I'll lay you
evens he killed Kennedy as well.

31
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,210
- Hello? - 'You're being fitted
up for murdering Rod Kennedy.'

32
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,260
If you want a way out,
you'll listen to me.

33
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,220
Did he ever mention any other
names? Politicians? Coppers?

34
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,660
Single-handedly brings
in an AFO. Well done.

35

'I'd just like to get on with my life.'

37
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,410
Miss Denton.

38
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,370
I'm Gill Bigelow, legal counsel to AC-12.

39
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,890
I imagine they keep you VERY busy.

40
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,780
Have a seat.

41
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,930
You know Superintendent Hastings.

42
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,860
I do.

43
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,090
As part of a new initiative,
christened Truth and Reconciliation,

44
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,490
following a miscarriage of
justice, parties are invited to

45
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,810
engage in dialogue to
initiate the healing process.

46
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,450
There seems to be an oversight.

47
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,650
Some of the officers involved in
my wrongful conviction are missing.

48
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,650
Superintendent Hastings, as
senior investigating officer,

49
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,010
represents the whole team.

50
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,770
Well, I want them here

51
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,100
or this new box you need
to tick, just, well...

52
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,770
.. won't get ticked.

53
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,660
(God, give me strength!)

54
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,100
Thank you. It wouldn't have
been the same without you.

55
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,490
Miss Denton, on behalf of this department

56
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,650
and this constabulary,
I offer you a sincere

57
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,890
and unconditional apology
for your wrongful conviction

58
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,060
in respect of the offence
of conspiracy to murder.

59
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,540
Ted?

60
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,050
Er, as the senior investigating officer,

61
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,650
I acknowledge your feelings
regarding your conviction.

62
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,380
WRONGFUL conviction, and you
haven't actually said sorry.

63
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,650
Maybe you'll do better, DS Arnott.

64
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,770
You require me to sign off
that I accept your apology.

65
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,170
I won't, unless it comes from
the officers who wronged me.

66
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,490
You're out. What more do you want?

67
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,690
An... apology.

68
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,860
(Jesus Christ!)

69
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,500
This isn't going very well at all, is it?

70
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,660
Ted?

71
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:09,620
As senior investigating officer,
I apologise for your conviction.

72
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,780
You omitted "wrongful" but,
thank you, that's very gracious.

73
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,410
DS Arnott? We're all waiting.

74
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,330
Your allegation that I planted
incriminating evidence against you

75
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,690
is false.

76
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,970
Point of information --
I've made two allegations.

77
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,490
One, you engaged in
inappropriate sexual relations

78
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,250
whilst on an undercover operation.

79
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,490
And, two, you planted
Â£50,000 to simulate a bribe.

80
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,050
- And it's all crap!
- Steve.

81
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,650
Really? Do tell.

82
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,890
Lindsay Denton knows our
procedures inside out.

83
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,370
She exploited doubts and grey areas
to tie our investigation in knots.

84
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,250
Oh, you did that all by yourself.

85
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,170
First, DC Fleming's failed
undercover operation and then yours.

86
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,130
- I didn't do too badly. You ended
up in prison. - And we didn't fail.

87
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,650
We got you convicted.

88
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,370
But you know sexual misconduct
by undercover officers is a hot

89
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,290
topic so you invented this story
about us going to bed together

90
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,090
so the jury sees you as a wronged woman.

91
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,850
They obviously felt that I must
have shagged you into conspiring

92
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,840
- to murder a protected witness.
- Stephen!

93
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,050
Thank you, DS Arnott.

94
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,810
I couldn't agree more that the
question of your sexual integrity

95
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,860
quite rightly made the jury sceptical...

96
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,410
.. but I've got a recording that
will be of interest to you all.

97
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,490
All right, then. This just
isn't the time or the place.

98
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,780
Now is exactly the time
and exactly the place.

99
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,450
Not in court, in a room full
of rubberneckers and reporters,

100
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,970
my pathetic private life laid out
for everyone to laugh at, to pity.

101
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,090
I couldn't bear that.

102
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,330
But to show you all what
kind of officer got me

103
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,330
locked up for 585 miserable days,

104
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,060
THAT I can live with.

105
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,330
I've had my whole life put on trial

106
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,850
and now it's your turn.

107
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,730
You've been charged and tried
but the one person that refuses

108
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,810
to examine what you're accused of is you.

109
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,370
I'm innocent.

110
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,140
The question is -- are you?

111
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,410
This phone was next to
the bed the entire time,

112
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,500
although I can believe that you
were too preoccupied to notice.

113
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,620
Would you like me to,
erm, play it for everyone?

114
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,300
DS Arnott?

115
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,780
No.

116
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,180
Christ sake, Steve.

117
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,090
Well, I feel this meeting's
been remarkably successful

118
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,450
and I'll be very happy
to record, in writing,

119
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,730
that it's been a healing
process for all parties.

120
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,970
I'd also prefer it

121
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,250
if you'd consider closing the matter
of DS Arnott's sexual impropriety.

122
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,300
I don't intend to make a
statement of evidence.

123
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,450
The people that actually did the
crime that I was imprisoned for,

124
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,210
they're still out there.

125
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,090
Superintendent, you uphold the
integrity of the police service.

126
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:14,010
If you held one iota of
doubt about my conviction,

127
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,210
no officer would be more
troubled by that than you.

128
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,970
No officer would do
more to right that wrong.

129
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,610
I plan to move on with my life.

130
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,130
You won't move on, Steve,
until you stop chasing me

131
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,460
and you start chasing your real enemies.

132
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,650
For Christ's sake, son,
what was in that phone?!

133
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,010
We've got to take that crap from her, sir?

134
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,250
You lied in court! You lied to
your partner and you lied to me!

135
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,810
I didn't lie to you, sir, I
just don't think it's appropriate

136
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,650
to discuss an officer's private life.

137
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,610
I don't quiz you on yours.

138
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,530
What do you mean by that?

139
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,050
- I'm a married man.
- I know, sir.

140
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,370
Anyway, it isn't private when it's
bandied about in a court of law.

141
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,650
What matters, sir, is
whether I planted evidence.

142
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,050
Are there any forensic anomalies
in respect of the money

143
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,650
found at Denton's address? No.

144
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,410
It matches the other bribe money.

145
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,210
Are the exhibit officer's records
inaccurate or incomplete?

146
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,610
- That is NOT the issue!
- It's completely the issue.

147
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,010
I did not plant evidence.

148
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,770
If... IF I'd had sex with
Lindsay Denton, which I didn't,

149
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,220
does that stop her being guilty?

150
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,300
Lindsay Denton has left the building.

151
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,420
Steve Arnott should do the same.

152
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,250
Discreditable conduct.

153
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,890
Steve Arnott did not plant evidence.

154
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,140
But it's OK to have a
relationship with a suspect?

155
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,090
I can see how you feel about this, Ted.

156
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,970
Why defend the indefensible?

157
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,850
Look, he can be an irritating wee
gobshite when he wants to be,

158
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,610
- I'll give you that.
- I'll tell you why.

159
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,370
Because you personally recruited
him from counter-terrorism

160
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,890
and that means you having
to admit your misjudgment.

161
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,500
Sorry, Ted, I intend to
return to this conversation.

162
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,260
Kate.

163
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,580
Kate, wait, please.

164
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,210
One time you told me Lindsay
Denton had dirt on you.

165
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,770
Remember what I said.

166
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,090
Maybe there are some people
who always tell the truth.

167
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,650
- The rest of us choose our moments.
- And that's what I had to do.

168
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,730
To ensure evidence was put in front
of a jury that would convict Lindsay

169
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,410
- Denton of a crime we all know she committed.
- But we don't know.

170
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,650
The only person who really
knows is Lindsay herself.

171
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,410
We gather the evidence and the
people decide and they've decided

172
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,730
she didn't do it cos you
couldn't keep it in your pants!

173
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,890
- That's not what happened.
- What happened?

174
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,610
It was an undercover operation in which

175
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,210
I nurtured the trust of the target.

176
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,530
That is straight out of the
manual and total bollocks.

177
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,930
- You shagged her because you wanted to.
- I didn't shag her.

178
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,050
Do you know what, Steve?
This is all a bit too late.

179
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,490
You should have told me the truth,

180
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,450
given me the chance to
work with you on this.

181
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,570
That's what partners do.

182
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:26,970
For the tape, image 313 is a
photograph of item reference NTW-7.

183
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,780
Said item is a rope found hanging
from an overhead support.

184
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,450
Detective Inspector Cottan has
given us a statement where you

185
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,810
attempted to overpower him with the
intent of causing death by hanging.

186
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,410
The exact same means as PC Rod Kennedy.

187
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,810
I didn't murder Rod and I absolutely
didn't attempt to murder DI Cottan.

188
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,050
In fact, DI Cottan set me up.

189
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,490
He set you up?!

190
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,770
Yeah, Cottan smashed himself in the
face to make it look like I hit him

191
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,530
but I didn't.

192
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,530
As far as the rope goes, he must
have planted it there beforehand.

193
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,690
- He'll say anything to
save his own skin. - Yeah.

194
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,130
And why would an officer
of mine do such a thing, eh?

195
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,450
To frame me for Rod's murder.

196
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,250
Do you have anything to support
these claims against DI Cottan?

197
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,370
I mean, anything at all?

198
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,290
For the tape, the interviewee is
offering no supporting evidence.

199
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,450
Moving on. DS Arnott.

200
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,610
For the tape, image
291, item reference MR-3

201
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,690
and image 292, item reference MR-4.

202
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,530
MR-3 and 4 are mobile phones.

203
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,250
A Section 18 search of
your property recovered

204
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,090
a pair of unregistered pay-as-you-go
phones concealed in the garage.

205
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,930
Document 16, analysis of activity
on these phones reveals they made

206
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,370
and received calls within
the telecommunications cell

207
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,410
that covers your home address.

208
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,970
Three nights before the
murder of Danny Waldron,

209
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,970
a call was received by
one of these phones.

210
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,690
Who called you?

211
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,210
No comment.

212
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,930
Document 16 again. The night
before Danny Waldron's murder.

213
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,920
- Another call.
- Who called you that night?

214
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,090
Calls of a suspicious nature
were made shortly before you

215
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,770
volunteered to continue serving
on Danny Waldron's squad

216
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,020
and before you murdered him.

217
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,580
Who made those calls and
what did they ask you to do?

218
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,010
For the tape, the interviewee
is not answering.

219
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,370
This pattern of communication,

220
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,290
unregistered pay-as-you-go
phones used for a short period

221
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,930
then discarded, is one we all
recognise from organised crime.

222
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,250
Who's got you in their pocket?

223
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,410
Nobody.

224
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,730
Hari, we have you receiving phone
calls linked to Danny's murder.

225
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,730
We have you lobbying to
stay on Danny's squad.

226
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,090
We have your hands all over the firearm.

227
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,730
We have you consistently lying
about Danny's activities.

228
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,650
We have a witness who says
it was you who did all this

229
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,330
and not PC Rod Kennedy.

230
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,890
We have you at the murder scene

231
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,810
and we have you in possession of
the instruments of Kennedy's death.

232
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,370
Now, that's about the height of it

233
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,730
and it's a great big pile of evidence

234
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,340
that is going to crush you flat.

235
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,050
Now, come on...

236
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,250
.. you killed Danny Waldron, yes or no?

237
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,420
Yeah. Yeah.

238
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,820
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.

239
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,130
We know you can't have been acting alone.

240
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,130
Help us help you.

241
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,980
Who gave the order to kill Danny Waldron?

242
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,010
Who was it?

243
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,970
It...

244
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,210
Come on, who was it? Who was it?

245
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,810
You've got the bastard. Come on, talk.

246
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,530
- He never gave me a name.
- Who didn't?

247
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,780
The bloke I always spoke to.

248
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,460
Sounded like it was a
Londoner, south-east or summat.

249
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,850
It was all done over the phone, wasn't it?

250
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,490
- I never met anyone, like.
- You've got to know more.

251
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,130
Times, places, other contacts.

252
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,410
Look, someone's behind all
this pulling the strings

253
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,730
and I want to know who it is.

254
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,490
Ronan Murphy, the suspect
killed by Danny Waldron,

255
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,210
what do you know about him?

256
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,260
- Nothing.
- They had history, Danny and him.

257
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,370
That's news to me.

258
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,930
Danny shot Murphy and was going
after Murphy's associates.

259
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,890
They were the ones that wanted Danny
dead. The job you did for them.

260
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,530
I didn't know Murphy. I
didn't know his associates.

261
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,450
- I don't know why they wanted Danny dead.
- Look, who's behind this?

262
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,800
What was Danny on to that
meant you had to kill him?

263
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,860
You've nothing further to say?

264
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,130
You've offered nothing new in this
interview to mitigate you being

265
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,700
charged with the following offences.
I therefore have the authority...

266
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:09,210
- Well, we got the bastard.
- Yeah. They should throw away the key.

267
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,810
.. of PC Roderick Kennedy.

268
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,930
Two, the murder of PS Daniel Waldron

269
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,930
and, three, the attempted
murder of DI Matthew Cottan.

270
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,060
Now, do you understand?

271
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,080
I've been doing more work
on the Ronan Murphy file.

272
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,530
There's a small entry,
blink and you'd miss it,

273
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,850
that he was interviewed by
Murder Squad in relation to

274
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,770
unsolved gangland murders,

275
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,820
but there's no details of the
offences he was being linked to.

276
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,940
Can't help you.

277
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,290
How many times are we
going to go over this?

278
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,210
Lindsay lied in court to con the jury.

279
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,330
Maybe you're thinking,

280
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,570
"If he'd shag a suspect, who
else is he going to shag?"

281
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,130
I can't help you because I've
never heard of any Murder Squad

282
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,490
investigation into Ronan Murphy.

283
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,740
If I had, don't you think I'd
have bloody told you by now?

284
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,060
'Still subject to delays due to
overrunning engineering work...'

285
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,700
Bastards!

286
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,520
Making all your money, are you, eh?

287
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,260
You bunch of bleedin' twats!

288
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,170
Eh!

289
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,300
You shitter!

290
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,680
You bunch of bastards!

291
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,090
Oh, here they are. Come on then!

292
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,860
Great.

293
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,900
They should rip it down.

294
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,890
Smash every brick away.

295
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,210
Joe, we've spoken to the
officer handling your case.

296
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,660
No-one's going to press charges.

297
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,220
Those bastards.

298
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,220
They're going to get
away with what they done.

299
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,970
You know I'm gutted Dale Roach
is unfit to face prosecution.

300
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,450
But, listen, Joe, we're looking
into the complaints made by you

301
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,850
or Danny or any of the
other lads to the police

302
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,420
about the abuse you were made
to suffer by staff and visitors.

303
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,660
Any police that came...

304
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,410
.. they just talked to the staff.

305
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:02,300
They were the bastards who were
organising it in the first place...

306
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:07,300
.. and anyone who talked about it,
they just got it ten times worse.

307
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:14,100
We're doing everything we can,
but we still need your help, Joe.

308
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,530
We're particularly interested in this man.

309
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,520
Now, you identified him
as a football coach.

310
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,770
His name's Ronan Murphy.

311
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:29,100
Did you, or anyone you know,
ever make a complaint about him?

312
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,140
Yeah, there was one time.

313
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,540
A social worker.

314
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,180
We did nothing. Nothing was done.

315
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,860
- What social worker?
- Just some posh twat.

316
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,220
Posh to us, anyway.

317
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,730
We need a name, Joe.

318
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,090
Oliver Stephens-Lloyd,

319
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,050
a registered social worker with
responsibility at Sands View.

320
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,930
He was a council employee around
the time that Danny Waldron

321
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,770
and Joe Nash were residents.

322
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,690
Only record found so far is of
a disciplinary hearing accusing

323
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,170
Stephens-Lloyd of dealing
cannabis to the residents.

324
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,890
Stephens-Lloyd denied the charges
and insisted he was being

325
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,650
victimised because he tried to raise
concerns about abuse at Sands View.

326
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,490
All other records have been lost.

327
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,690
Variously reported destroyed in
a fire or lost in an office move.

328
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,810
The tribunal report's
existence is probably

329
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,410
an oversight by whoever has
been destroying records.

330
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,250
All we have so far is Stephens-Lloyd
alleging that a number

331
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,090
of individuals, many of whom
are in positions of authority,

332
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,490
were part of a network of abusers.

333
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,730
He referred to compiling
a list of names that he

334
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,770
passed on to the police
but it appears none of

335
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,570
Stephens-Lloyd's allegations
were investigated.

336
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,250
And regarding this list and
the officer it was passed to?

337
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,170
- No record. - No record.
- We'll keep looking.

338
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,930
- Find this social worker. - Sir. - Sir.

339
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,530
Terrific presentation, guys.

340
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,720
Honestly, really terrific.

341
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,890
Steve, before Danny died,
he tried to say something.

342
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,450
I thought he said "listen" and then
couldn't get any more words out.

343
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,100
Now I reckon what he said was "list".

344
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,780
Cheers, Kate.

345
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,530
Maneet, the evidence recovered
from Danny Waldron's flat.

346
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,410
- Er, yeah.
- The empty envelope.

347
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,850
Ronan Murphy was shot dead
in the heat of the moment,

348
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,940
but Linus, Danny had time with
him, time to get information.

349
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,460
Let's see.

350
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,600
They never tested the envelope.

351
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,740
What?

352
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:47,090
- Bloody forensics. - They're on a
tight budget this financial year.

353
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,450
I don't care about their
budget. Get it tested now.

354
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,540
Thanks, Maneet.

355
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,700
So, what was all that about then?

356
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,450
This is where Stephens-Lloyd's
body was found.

357
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:11,010
This is the original report,
dated 21st November 1998.

358
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:14,610
Oliver Stephens-Lloyd was last
seen a few weeks beforehand.

359
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,610
His body was found on
the 14th by a fisherman.

360
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,660
- Statement's in the file.
- What's going on?

361
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,210
I've asked Murder Squad if
they'll reopen the case.

362
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,650
- Right.
- Hiya.

363
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,930
- All right?
- You all right?

364
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,730
We just re-interviewed the
fisherman who found the body.

365
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,050
He recalls that pretty
much the first thing he was

366
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,450
told at the scene was that
it had to be a suicide.

367
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,770
It also appears no photos or
videos were taken of the scene.

368
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,010
Was there a missing persons report
or investigation at the time?

369
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,770
There was. The report's
cursory, to say the least.

370
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,650
Doesn't look as if anyone was actively

371
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,730
searching for Stephens-Lloyd.

372
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,170
The SIO at the time was
a DI Marcus Thirwell.

373
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,970
He's no longer serving but we're
doing our best to track him down.

374
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,170
The pathologist's autopsy report
at the time stated the body had

375
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,410
superficial wounds and a broken arm,

376
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,450
which he put down to the
body being struck by a boat.

377
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,570
So my boss has agreed to reopen the case.

378
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,450
We're already seeking
permission to exhume the body.

379
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,250
Thanks. We'll be taking this from here.

380
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,250
- We've got an ongoing...
- It's ours now.

381
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,140
We'll keep you in the loop as best we can.

382
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,540
It seems like you're in
everybody's good books.

383
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,730
'Ticket number 41.'

384
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,370
Do you know how long I've been waiting?

385
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,170
- You need to complete the form.
- I've done all the forms!

386
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,690
- You're taking the
piss! - Lindsay? - Yeah.

387
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,050
My name's Tammy.

388
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,610
I'm one of the multi-disciplinary
offender management team.

389
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,250
- Is this your first appointment? - Yep.

390
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,290
I'm ready to restart my life...

391
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,490
Lovely.

392
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,530
.. by rejoining the police service.

393
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,700
Bollocks to this!

394
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,730
Er... it says here that you were
acquitted of conspiracy to murder,

395
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,250
but found guilty of perverting
the course of justice.

396
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,490
Yes, I'm appealing against the conviction.

397
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,170
I'm going to clear my name.

398
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,050
You won't be able to rejoin the
police with a criminal conviction.

399
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,810
I told you, I'm appealing.

400
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,410
Have you actually checked
to see that I can rejoin?

401
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,730
No, I haven't checked.

402
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:30,780
Well, then, I would like to apply
to rejoin the police service.

403
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,730
I'm sorry, why are you
looking at me like that?

404
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,130
Lindsay, I don't know you,
I've got nothing against you,

405
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,290
but I can't help you if
you're going to be in denial.

406
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,370
You're an offender,

407
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,170
which means there's no chance
you'll be able to rejoin the police.

408
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,410
- Yet I'm not a criminal.
- Let's look on the bright side.

409
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,740
Try getting you into work.
Everything follows from that.

410
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,170
OK.

411
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,530
Well, erm,

412
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,610
I was a detective inspector,

413
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,260
so I've got a valuable skill set.

414
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,450
So, any news on them forensics?

415
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,100
Erm, yes, sir.

416
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,210
There were notable findings
on the inside of the envelope

417
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:33,410
recovered from Danny Waldron's flat.

418
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,410
They found a number of tiny stains
less than a millimetre across.

419
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:41,210
Ink, standard biro -- could
have belonged to anyone.

420
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,610
And blood.

421
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,810
And that'd be Danny's, right?

422
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,400
No, sir, it matched Linus Murphy's.

423
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,010
The final report states that these
findings are consistent with

424
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,890
a blood-stained note written
during or shortly after

425
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,940
Danny Waldron's torture
murder of Linus Murphy.

426
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,580
- Should I send a copy
to DS Arnott, sir? - No.

427
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,930
No, I'll handle it for now, and...

428
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,940
.. and this is just between us for now?

429
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,580
Nice one.

430
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,610
Who is it?

431
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:50,900
Robin from the offender management team.

432
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,020
Come in.

433
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,980
Were you issued with
the information leaflet?

434
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,460
Good.

435
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,740
This is difficult for you...

436
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:26,050
.. and we're here to help
you pick up the pieces.

437
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,450
How long do I have to stay here?

438
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,940
You served half your sentence
and now you're out on licence.

439
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,440
You understand all this, of course.

440
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:43,130
We want to help you move on
but it's not going to be easy.

441
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:47,540
You're going to need money
for rent, for living expenses.

442
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,700
I can help you now, if you want.

443
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,380
Ten quid.

444
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,250
What are you saying?

445
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,930
I was just going through the role
of the MOMT in your adjustment

446
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,380
to life after prison.

447
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,220
Nice meeting you, Lindsay.

448
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,170
We both have such busy schedules,

449
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,130
I don't think the taxpayer will mind.

450
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,770
Shame I'm going to ruin the evening.

451
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,020
Right, well, you know
you can speak freely.

452
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,130
I can't tell you how
to run your department

453
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,530
but I want you to move Steve Arnott on.

454
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,290
Make him some other department's problem.

455
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,410
Let me tell you about Steve Arnott.

456
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,690
He's my most dogged investigator,

457
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,770
he will not leave a stone unturned.

458
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,450
I had intended that meeting
in a more social setting

459
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,970
would make this less
confrontational between us.

460
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,560
Yeah, well...

461
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,000
.. we've only just got started.

462
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,650
I would like the chicken liver pate

463
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,440
and the sea bass.

464
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,810
I'll be right back.

465
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:37,580
Thanks. And I'll have the soup
followed by the sirloin steak.

466
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,730
Medium well.

467
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,650
And...

468
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,100
no sauce.

469
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,700
What's the matter?

470
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,380
I'm a married man.

471
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,740
Separated.

472
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,300
I took vows.

473
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,900
I can't undo them.

474
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,680
Don't you want to stay with me, Ted?

475
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,850
I'm sorry, Gill.

476
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,940
I'm sorry.

477
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,970
I don't need to watch this if you
want to put something else on.

478
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,420
It's fine.

479
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,450
You hungry? Want to go out?

480
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,980
Tired.

481
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,850
Yeah, all right.

482
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,940
I need to tell you what I
found out about Ronan Murphy.

483
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,650
What, you looked into it?

484
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,250
Murphy was a person of interest

485
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,300
in the inquiry into the
murder of Tommy Hunter.

486
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,650
In what way?

487
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:44,130
Ronan Murphy was one of
Hunter's closest associates.

488
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,370
We never interviewed him.

489
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,490
Major Violent Crime did.

490
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,010
Ronan Murphy was interviewed

491
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,610
about the conspiracy Lindsay
Denton was convicted of?

492
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,130
Looks like it.

493
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,370
None of this was in the file.

494
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,090
It must been doctored.

495
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,680
You didn't get any of this from me.

496
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,280
Well, well...

497
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,340
Who'd have thought?

498
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,780
What are you after?

499
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,210
You ever heard the name Ronan Murphy?

500
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,370
Why d'you ask?

501
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,730
Just thought you might
have heard the name.

502
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,920
Are you reopening my case?

503
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,810
Forget it, all right?

504
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,000
That's not why I'm asking.

505
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,290
Look, I don't expect you to care, Steve,

506
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,770
but I'm never, ever going to
get back to being that person

507
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,130
that I was before all this happened.

508
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,770
You know, the only thing
that kept me sane,

509
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,690
the thing that got me up in the morning,

510
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,490
was being a police officer.

511
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,810
I want to find the people
that framed me, Steve,

512
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,770
and I believe...

513
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,580
Well, I HOPE that you do, too.

514
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:05,330
The audio file on this phone is as
embarrassing to you as it is to me.

515
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,050
Believe you me, I've got it backed up.

516
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,980
I don't enjoy threatening people.

517
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,600
They make me.

518
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,970
Ronan Murphy was killed
by a police officer

519
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,530
and Murphy was a prime suspect
in the murder of Tommy Hunter

520
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,210
but, for some reason, that's
been hidden from AC-12.

521
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,850
Bring in the officer that killed him.

522
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,900
- He was killed a couple
of weeks after. - Why?

523
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,460
Oh, come on, Steve.

524
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,800
Best guess, he was breaking
open a paedophile ring.

525
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,300
What?

526
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,700
Don't you see?

527
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,130
Ronan Murphy was interviewed

528
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:53,280
by the team investigating
Tommy Hunter's murder.

529
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,730
And where did you get that from?

530
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,120
I'm not at liberty to say, sir.

531
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,570
Here we go again.

532
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:07,290
Tommy Hunter was involved
in grooming underage girls

533
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,370
and pimping them out

534
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,290
and he was about to turn informer.

535
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,730
The people who ordered his
murder didn't want what he knew

536
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,650
about child sexual
exploitation to come out

537
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,650
and that's exactly the same motive
as the murder of Danny Waldron.

538
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,850
They're connected.

539
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,810
Sir we know Hunter's murder
was orchestrated by the Caddy

540
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,650
and there's ample evidence that someone

541
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,170
was pulling Hari Bains' strings.

542
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,130
Using the exact same methods as the Caddy.

543
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,930
Voice contact only, multiple phones.

544
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,570
Yeah, but...

545
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,130
why couldn't this be the
Caddy? DC Cole is dead.

546
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,370
Well, the Caddy is my inquiry, sir,

547
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,450
so maybe I should be
the one to look into it.

548
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,810
- Yeah, I'd be grateful.
- Sir.

549
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,730
- Sir...
- What?

550
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,520
Something to say?

551
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,940
Well, you're not at liberty.

552
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,700
Sir.

553
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,730
Well, I know exactly who
we should speak to first.

554
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,570
Who?

555
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,730
We'll be fine, thanks, Steve.

556
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,250
See, the thing is, mate,

557
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,240
no-one likes a partner
holding out on them.

558
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,490
So, where you taking me?

559
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,840
To the lying bastard who
told us the Caddy was dead.

560
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,770
Well, why don't you let me handle this?

561
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,210
He's a chippy bastard.

562
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,660
If I'm there, there'll be
a witness to who said what.

563
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,920
Cheers.

564
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,570
Dot.

565
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,810
Mate.

566
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,450
What's all this, then?

567
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,090
We're following up on a
statement you made in 2013

568
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,330
in connection with the
murder of Tommy Hunter.

569
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,120
OK if we come in?

570
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:52,730
Oh, well, you have done
well for yourself, eh?

571
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,130
You, too.

572
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,720
Landed on your feet, you might say.

573
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,210
Crime audit.

574
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,660
We gather important figures
for important figures.

575
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,730
So...

576
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,730
how can I be of assistance to AC-12?

577
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:13,130
This report, sensitive parts
of which are not for your eyes,

578
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,920
quotes your statement regarding DC Cole.

579
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,930
DI Cottan wrote this.

580
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,730
I'm sure he can shed any light required.

581
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,050
This is just routine, Nige.

582
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,810
We're just following up
on one or two details.

583
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,450
Are these your words?

584
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,090
"DC Cole was nicknamed the Caddy

585
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,850
"because he wore golf jumpers
but never played golf.

586
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,850
"DC Cole boasted of underworld connections

587
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,450
"and attempted to recruit me
into a clandestine network

588
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,850
"of corrupt police officers."

589
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,730
I cooperated with your investigation.

590
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,410
But we've got some new lines of inquiry.

591
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,130
Did Cole ever mention a gangland
associate of Tommy Hunter

592
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,980
named Ronan Murphy?

593
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,610
Right.

594
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,690
You pointed the finger at Cole. You
led everyone up the garden path.

595
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,570
Meanwhile, we've got two coppers murdered.

596
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,690
I'm not saying another
word without a solicitor.

597
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,370
Fine, we'll continue this
conversation at AC-12 under caution,

598
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,690
a date to be appointed by us.

599
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,460
Thank you.

600
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,900
Sir.

601
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,890
You have to shut this down.

602
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,610
I will not let anyone put
you on the spot about Cole.

603
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,370
We both know why.

604
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,930
Shut this down now.

605
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,380
You know the secrets I can spill.

606
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,490
Why don't you come into
AC-12 with your solicitor,

607
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:42,610
you tell us you heard the Caddy
rumour about Cole off some old lag,

608
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,930
dead or lost his marbles,

609
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,380
and you leave me to do the rest?

610
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,540
And?

611
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,520
There's always an and.

612
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,130
And...

613
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,730
you turn over all the
stuff you've got on me.

614
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,130
End of.

615
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,520
End of?

616
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,810
The incriminating item I've got
on you, that's my only insurance.

617
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,410
You need me to shut this down.

618
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,770
I'm small fry.

619
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,690
You're the big fish.

620
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,570
So what'll happen when they find out

621
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,810
about all that evidence
you've been sitting on? Hm?

622
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,130
The contacts in that phone.

623
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,450
The call history.

624
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,440
All in my past, mind.

625
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,240
Now, that isn't something
anyone could shut down.

626
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:32,010
Now, you're what? Six months off retiring?

627
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,730
Four and a half.

628
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:38,100
Look, I wasn't more than a
kid when all this started.

629
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,730
Certain people pushed me
into joining the force

630
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,130
to do their dirty work from the inside.

631
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,010
And the truth is, mate,

632
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,530
I want to retire too.

633
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,650
Just in a different way.

634
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,770
But I can't do that till
I'm free of the past.

635
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,020
And you could be free, too.

636
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:01,140
Four and a half months, that's
you walking off into the sunset...

637
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:05,010
.. with none of this hanging over you.

638
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,650
What's going on?

639
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,620
He's here.

640
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,100
Nige.

641
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,370
Now, the purpose of today's interview

642
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:36,090
is to re-examine a statement
provided voluntarily by DC Morton

643
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,650
on October 17, 2013.

644
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,300
This is document one in your folders.

645
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,610
Is this your statement?

646
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,170
It is.

647
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,850
And do you now wish to amend
your statement in any way?

648
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,610
I do.

649
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:53,210
DC Jeremy Cole was a corrupt officer,

650
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,890
the sort there's no room
for in the police service.

651
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:58,570
What he got up to sickened me.

652
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,330
I did have occasion to meet Cole

653
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,730
and he did at one time boast

654
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,010
about his connections
to underworld figures.

655
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,930
Did you report Cole?

656
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,410
Although this is a voluntary interview,

657
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,250
I request the professional courtesy

658
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:15,690
of being questioned by an officer
at least one rack superior.

659
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,010
Why didn't you report Cole at the time?

660
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,530
I thought he was a lippy kid.

661
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,290
He was full of it.

662
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,540
I didn't believe his boasts.

663
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:27,690
Much later, I learned about his offences.

664
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:30,170
If only I'd acted, I might
have prevented them.

665
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,610
I'm extremely remorseful.

666
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,450
In regards to your statement
of Cole being the Caddy,

667
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,930
would you now like to make
any further amendments?

668
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,770
I never heard Cole
himself use that nickname.

669
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,410
I got it from another
source, then I passed it on.

670
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,170
I should have made that clear
in my original statement.

671
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,130
I'm extremely remorseful.

672
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,370
Right, and who was the other source?

673
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,450
An old friend from my
days on armed robbery.

674
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,240
Terry Capistrano.

675
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,410
And do you have any further information?

676
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,650
No, sir.

677
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,240
Only that I'm extremely remorseful.

678
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,290
Well, thank you, DC Morton.

679
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,450
No further questions.

680
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,440
Interview terminated.

681
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,720
Wanker.

682
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,170
Right, well, I'll check
out this name he gave us.

683
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:31,210
Oh, well, I wouldn't bother if I were you.

684
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,450
Terry Capistrano got Alzheimer's.

685
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,930
He was retired sick. The poor
bugger's lost his marbles.

686
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,130
Convenient.

687
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,290
Oh, come off it, Kate.
Nigel's just trying to help.

688
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,330
Can we be sure?

689
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,170
Look, I know he's a mate and everything,

690
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,770
but he's a few months off retirement

691
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,570
and, between me and you, his
missus hasn't been too well lately.

692
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,370
Well, I really don't give a shit.

693
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,020
Look, his heart's in the right place.

694
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:56,280
Let's just leave this
cock-up behind us, eh?

695
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,100
Please.

696
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,770
Yeah. Well, I suppose I can overlook it.

697
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,450
Thanks.

698
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,050
I really appreciate it.

699
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,090
Now we know the Caddy's active again,

700
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,530
this time we get the bastard.

701
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:12,780
Yeah.

702
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:17,920
Lindsay?

703
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,620
Thank you.

704
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,930
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

705
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,780
What's this about?

706
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:38,530
I'm afraid I've heard

707
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,050
that you've been absent from work.

708
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,130
I'm concerned that you're not coping

709
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:47,570
and, if you were to get into trouble
again, you'd return to prison.

710
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:50,290
- I'm never going back to prison. - Mm.

711
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:58,210
But you can't afford to lose that job.

712
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,700
What did you expect for ten quid?

713
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,330
I was trying to help you.

714
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:19,960
20.

715
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,370
Don't you try making
up any lies about this

716
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,170
because it's all on video.

717
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:20,490
You can't do that! It's illegal!

718
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:24,610
You're saying that I can't record
you without your prior knowledge,

719
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,130
as a breach of Article 8
of the Human Rights Act?

720
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:30,330
I'll take your Human Rights Act
and I'll raise you Section 4

721
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:33,530
of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997

722
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,530
and your offence under that act

723
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:38,620
carries a maximum prison
sentence of five years.

724
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,640
I'll see you in court.

725
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,210
Where's Maneet?

726
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,060
Off sick, I heard.

727
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,770
Some forensics I've asked her to chase up.

728
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:18,210
It'll just have to wait.

729
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:22,410
Oh, Kate's got a postmortem report
for you, if you're interested.

730
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:23,800
Thanks.

731
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,850
Yeah, if you just get a couple of...

732
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,930
You've got a new PM on
Oliver Stephens-Lloyd?

733
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,490
Yeah.

734
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:38,650
Are you going to get round to telling me?

735
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,900
Yeah.

736
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,890
The new autopsy found significant
differences from the original.

737
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:49,010
Both arms were broken and there
was a severe skull fracture.

738
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:51,210
The fracture wasn't
consistent with a flat surface

739
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:54,370
like the hull of a boat. It
looked more like a hammer blow.

740
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:55,530
Right.

741
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,530
Look at the original PM.

742
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,980
The distribution list at the end.

743
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:04,050
Routine distribution to
senior officers at the time.

744
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,050
Routine except for one name.

745
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:09,050
Chief Superintendent Fairbank had
nothing to do with this case.

746
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,530
He ran Vice.

747
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,770
Also copied in on the
missing persons report.

748
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:15,330
What do we know about Chief
Superintendent Fairbank?

749
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:16,580
This.

750
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,250
Councillor Dale Roach with guess who?

751
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,570
Chief Superintendent Fairbank.

752
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,220
Roach and Fairbank.

753
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,180
Roach and Fairbank.

754
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,370
Chief Superintendent
Fairbank retired in 2008.

755
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,450
Oh, yeah. Pat ran vice for donkey's years.

756
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,690
If Oliver Stephens-Lloyd did submit
a list of abusers at Sands View,

757
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:49,680
almost certainly it
would have gone to Vice.

758
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,930
Almost certainly.

759
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,650
Which makes the fact he was copied in

760
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,290
on Stephens-Lloyd's missing
persons and postmortem reports

761
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,410
all the more suspicious.

762
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:04,820
Sir, former Chief Superintendent
Fairbank still lives in the area.

763
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:17,210
Well, let's see what he's
got to say for himself.

764
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,530
Good work, you two. Good work.

765
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,180
- Sir.
- Sir.

766
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:31,890
Come in, please.

767
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:33,370
Very grateful for your time, sir.

768
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,450
Oh, anything I can do to help.

769
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,570
And I'm retired now,
there's no need for the sir.

770
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,020
Follow me.

771
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:44,490
Take a seat.

772
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,530
- I'm DS...
- Tea or coffee?

773
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,530
We're fine. Thank you, sir.

774
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:50,690
As I was saying, I'm DS Arnott.

775
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,210
DC Fleming.

776
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,490
Mr Fairbank, we'd like to begin by
asking you about a social worker

777
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:01,060
who went missing in October
'98, Oliver Stephens-Lloyd.

778
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:04,130
Doesn't ring a bell.

779
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:07,300
If we may, sir, perhaps this
report might jog your memory.

780
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:14,010
Blind as a bat without these.

781
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,970
Are you sure you don't
want a tea or coffee?

782
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,220
We're fine. Thank you, sir.

783
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:34,890
Sorry.

784
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,490
The report was copied to you.

785
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,810
I mean, is there any reason
you might take an interest?

786
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,610
None at all.

787
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:43,570
Can you explain why you'd
be sent this report?

788
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,850
Well, I don't remember any of this.

789
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,530
I mean, you're going
back a good many years.

790
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:53,280
We'd like to show you some
newspaper clippings, if we may.

791
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:10,840
You appear to be quite close
to Councillor Dale Roach.

792
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,730
Our paths crossed occasionally.

793
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:15,980
Usually at a charity event.

794
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,690
We weren't close.

795
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:21,850
Well, we're looking into allegations
of child sexual exploitation

796
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,100
involving Councillor Roach.

797
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:30,970
As head of Vice, did you ever deal
with any complaints against Roach?

798
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:34,130
Well, there may have
been some such saying,

799
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:37,450
"Councillor Roach has done this,"
or, "Councillor Roach did that."

800
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,730
And what would it be
that the councillor did?

801
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,330
Well, I don't recall the details

802
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,810
but, when these things came up,

803
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:45,570
they would have been looked into.

804
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:47,610
Did you ever deal with complaints of abuse

805
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:49,850
at Sands View Boys' Home?

806
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,690
That doesn't ring a bell.

807
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:53,290
There was a specific allegation

808
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:55,570
made by the social worker
that we're talking about,

809
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:56,730
Oliver Stephens-Lloyd.

810
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:58,210
Sorry.

811
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:01,250
Well, Stephens-Lloyd claimed he
compiled a list of authority figures

812
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,890
who, with the collusion of staff,

813
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:06,690
conducted systematic abuse of
boys resident at Sands View.

814
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:10,770
See, I've never even heard
of this Stands View place.

815
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:13,130
Oh! Sorry.

816
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:15,450
- I'll get that, love!
- OK!

817
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,570
Here he is!

818
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,930
- Hope I'm not too late.
- Spot on.

819
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,170
How you keeping, Ted?

820
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,820
Yeah, can't complain, can't complain.

821
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:31,330
I hope you don't mind me calling you.

822
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:34,680
Not at all, sir. A matter
of professional courtesy.

823
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,210
As you were. As you were.

824
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,770
Oh, now, you'll stay after, won't you?

825
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:48,050
Joyce'll kill me if I let you off
the hook from her Victoria sponge!

826
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,610
That's very kind of you, sir!

827
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:51,060
Thank you.

828
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:54,810
Don't mind me.

829
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,660
Now, where were we?

830
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,360
Where's Hastings?

831
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,450
Briefing.

832
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:29,010
Inspectors and above only.

833
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:30,260
Kate.

834
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:38,690
What the hell was going on

835
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:40,690
with Hastings showing
up at Fairbank's house?

836
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,610
You heard Fairbank. He called
him, put the gaffer on the spot.

837
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,410
Yeah, well, I saw the
handshake at the door.

838
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,130
It was masonic.

839
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:52,890
In that file on Ronan Murphy,

840
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:54,250
Murphy's connection to Hunter

841
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,330
must have been concealed
by police officers,

842
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:58,520
and who gave us that file?

843
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:01,220
Hastings.

844
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:13,530
The Caddy is the codename
for a serving police officer

845
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:16,130
with lifelong links to organised crime,

846
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:18,530
working as a fixer
within the police service

847
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:20,530
for certain criminal interests.

848
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:24,730
No officer has ever been
irrefutably identified as the Caddy,

849
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,420
hence his existence is putative.

850
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:32,210
The term was first heard
in a video statement

851
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:34,460
made by John Thomas Hunter.

852
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:38,690
DC Jeremy Cole, deceased.

853
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:42,090
Now, Cole was originally presumed
on the balance of probabilities

854
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:43,530
to be the Caddy,

855
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:46,580
but that conclusion is
no longer supportable.

856
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:51,170
PC Harinderpal Bains.

857
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:53,010
A corrupt AFO.

858
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:54,850
His statements of evidence have led

859
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:57,940
to the most accurate profile
yet of this individual.

860
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:01,220
The Caddy is male.

861
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:04,730
Given his lifelong links
to organised crime,

862
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:08,010
the Caddy is almost certainly
from a working-class background

863
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:10,600
and grew up in an urban environment.

864
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,370
Given the history of his activities,

865
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:17,370
starting from sometime
between 2005 to 2010,

866
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,370
according to the video
statement by Tommy Hunter,

867
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:23,060
the Caddy is probably under 35.

868
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:26,810
Given his access to
confidential information

869
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:28,930
regarding ongoing operations,

870
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:32,730
the Caddy is almost certainly a detective.

871
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:35,170
His ability to manage communications

872
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,690
without ever betraying his own identity

873
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:41,130
implies a highly trained,
highly sophisticated approach

874
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:44,210
to covert operations that is associated

875
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:45,650
with counter-terrorism.

876
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:49,130
And, lastly, Bains
describes the Caddy's voice

877
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:53,300
as having a London or south-east accent.

878
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,380
There's your bullet points.

879
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:09,210
All right, everybody,
let's leave it there.

880
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:10,660
Thank you.

881
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:24,170
Of course, this is only a profile.

882
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,410
There's lots of people
this description could fit.

883
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,530
But only the Caddy

884
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:30,050
could have got his hands on
Lindsay Denton's bribe money

885
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:32,130
from the right forensics source.

886
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:33,770
Sorry, gaffer,

887
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:36,760
but the finger's pointing
at one of our own.

888
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:32,930
All right?

889
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:34,380
All right?

890
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,490
SIM card?

891
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:44,340
It's all in there.

892
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:55,650
I don't know what to say.

893
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,300
That it, then?

894
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,180
Yeah.

895
00:57:14,305 --> 00:58:14,627

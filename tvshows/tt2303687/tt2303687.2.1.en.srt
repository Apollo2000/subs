1
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:09,261
Urgent call for the Duty Inspector.

2
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:14,740
DI Denton.

3
00:00:14,741 --> 00:00:17,500
DS Jayne Akers, calling with
request for urgent assistance,

4
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:19,341
immediate
and credible threat to life.

5
00:00:22,101 --> 00:00:23,740
We need Gold to sign off.

6
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:25,260
Chief Super's gone home.

7
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:26,541
Well then, call him at home.

8
00:00:30,141 --> 00:00:32,060
'This is
Chief Superintendent Mallick...

9
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:34,821
'please leave your name and number
and I will get back to you.'

10
00:00:36,421 --> 00:00:38,340
He's not picking up his mobile
either.

11
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:40,861
We really ought to give him another
five minutes.

12
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:43,341
Ma'am...

13
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:45,781
There she goes...

'Deputy Chief Constable Dryden.'

16
00:00:53,381 --> 00:00:55,460
Sir, this is DI Lindsay Denton.

17
00:00:55,461 --> 00:00:56,980
Yes, Linda, how can I help you?

18
00:00:56,981 --> 00:00:58,981
'Sir, I need Gold approval
for an op.'

19
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:03,980
We allowed to know where
we're going?

20
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:07,260
Suspect in a missing persons enquiry,
need to get him in for questioning.

21
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:10,140
No, my car! What? Just... come on!

22
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:12,181
Come on!

24
00:01:37,461 --> 00:01:40,341
DS Akers.
Thanks for stepping in, ma'am.

25
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:45,580
I need a safe
and available destination ASAP.

26
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:47,420
Straight into town?

27
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:48,981
I'd take the back roads.

28
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:56,420
You lead. Have your men in my car,
engine running, ready to go.

29
00:01:56,421 --> 00:01:58,660
Yeah, I'm going to take
the rest of your team...

30
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:00,580
It's just me. What?

31
00:02:00,581 --> 00:02:01,701
Ma'am...

32
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:04,101
..please.

33
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:07,060
OK.

34
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:08,700
Keep the radio
in the car on channel 1.

35
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:11,100
Personal radios back-to-back on 2.

36
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:13,500
Who's in the house?
I don't know.

37
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:14,901
Just move. Please.

38
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,421
Wallis to Denton, it's
straight on here, ma'am.

39
00:02:53,301 --> 00:02:55,421
Yeah.
I know the way to my own station.

40
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:15,101
No!

41
00:03:35,941 --> 00:03:39,700
Charlie Mike two-five, status zero,
status zero, Long Lane
and Crown Avenue!

42
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:42,220
Charlie Mike two-five,
confirm message.

43
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:43,941
Status zero, status zero!

44
00:04:57,301 --> 00:04:58,541
How are you, Lindsay?

45
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:01,861
Anything I can get you?

46
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,941
No, thanks.

47
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:10,821
Up to answering
a couple of questions?

48
00:05:13,141 --> 00:05:16,741
I'm just trying to get my head
around what happened out there, sir.

49
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:21,860
But no-one seems to know what
you were up to...

50
00:05:21,861 --> 00:05:23,061
I'm not sure I do, either.

51
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:25,941
Wallis and Butler are dead.

52
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:28,620
The other two...

53
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:30,460
Get the next shot ready.

54
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:32,181
..they're still trying to save.

55
00:05:34,581 --> 00:05:36,220
Who are they?

56
00:05:36,221 --> 00:05:40,061
I'm not clear yet on whether that's
something I should be divulging,
sir.

57
00:05:44,101 --> 00:05:45,261
It'd help to know!

58
00:05:49,861 --> 00:05:51,740
I got your messages.

59
00:05:51,741 --> 00:05:52,980
Instead of dropping me in it,

60
00:05:52,981 --> 00:05:54,900
if you'd given me
a minute to get back to you.

61
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:57,500
I gave you more than a minute.

62
00:05:57,501 --> 00:05:58,981
I gave you 20.

63
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:30,940
Two more breaths, please.

64
00:06:30,941 --> 00:06:32,861
No... I'm calling it, asystolic.

65
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:37,900
Pulse-less for 20 minutes.

66
00:06:37,901 --> 00:06:39,980
Everyone OK with that?

67
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:42,141
OK, CPR discontinued at 23.12.

68
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:02,381
Everybody!

69
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:05,740
Evidence recovery's ongoing,
so, guys,

70
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:08,621
please respect the limits
of the cordon at all times.

71
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,820
Our forensic scene investigators
have work lights.

72
00:07:14,821 --> 00:07:16,980
Talk to me
if you need any lighting changes

73
00:07:16,981 --> 00:07:18,661
This way, sir.

74
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:45,020
Deputy Chief Constable Dryden.

75
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:47,700
There's been
an attack on the police.

76
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:52,020
Three of our colleagues have lost
their lives in the line of duty.

77
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:55,700
Our first thoughts are with
their families.

78
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:58,580
But now the hunt begins
for the people who committed

79
00:07:58,581 --> 00:07:59,941
this brutal crime.

80
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:30,300
This way.

81
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,221
'Doors closing.'

82
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:44,421
Sir. As you were.

83
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:02,660
The transit convoy was ambushed.

84
00:09:02,661 --> 00:09:05,860
The two 4th Street officers
were shot dead.

85
00:09:05,861 --> 00:09:08,380
The vehicle was set alight,
and the witness

86
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,980
and the handler suffered critical
burns and gunshot wounds.

87
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:13,581
The handler was pronounced
dead on arrival at the hospital.

88
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:18,420
We've been assigned to investigate
the possibility that

89
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:21,380
a police officer or officers tipped
somebody off.

90
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:23,220
Who is he?

91
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:26,020
Classified.
He was under Witness Protection.

92
00:09:26,021 --> 00:09:29,140
New identity, relocation, the WORKS.

93
00:09:29,141 --> 00:09:31,220
And how is he, sir, the witness?

94
00:09:31,221 --> 00:09:32,701
Critical but stable.

95
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:36,860
Can I ask you a question?

96
00:09:36,861 --> 00:09:38,061
Depends on the question.

97
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:42,660
"Critical but stable" -
what does that mean exactly?

98
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:44,780
Well, he's been lucky.
His chances are good.

99
00:09:44,781 --> 00:09:46,141
He doesn't look very lucky.

100
00:09:47,381 --> 00:09:48,741
I'll set up an alert.

101
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:53,100
As soon as he comes round,
we'll be banging on his door.

102
00:09:53,101 --> 00:09:54,741
Thank you. Sir.

103
00:09:56,021 --> 00:09:59,020
He said it was a convoy.
Who was in the other vehicles?

104
00:09:59,021 --> 00:10:02,420
Just one vehicle, driven by our only
other survivor, DI Lindsay Denton.

105
00:10:02,421 --> 00:10:04,460
When can we talk to her?

106
00:10:04,461 --> 00:10:06,220
I'm chasing.
But she's in counselling.

107
00:10:06,221 --> 00:10:08,780
Are we allowed to know
the names of the deceased officers?

108
00:10:08,781 --> 00:10:14,100
From 4th Street Station - Sergeant
Alex Wallis, PC Vincent Butler,

109
00:10:14,101 --> 00:10:17,260
and... the third victim's name is
being withheld from the public

110
00:10:17,261 --> 00:10:21,181
because she was from
Witness Protection - DS Jayne Akers.

111
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,380
Sorry, sir, I'll be down in five.

112
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:27,741
Sure.

113
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:49,181
You got a minute, sir?

114
00:10:50,581 --> 00:10:52,021
See you back at the office.

115
00:10:53,221 --> 00:10:55,061
This one's not for me, sir.

116
00:10:57,261 --> 00:10:59,420
This is going to be a very
high-profile case.

117
00:10:59,421 --> 00:11:00,940
I need my best team.

118
00:11:00,941 --> 00:11:02,820
I'm flattered, sir,
but I knew Jayne Akers.

119
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:04,260
We went through Ryton together.

120
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:07,860
Half the job went through
training together,
and we're not investigating Akers.

121
00:11:07,861 --> 00:11:09,420
Not yet.

122
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:11,420
There's three of our own
in the morgue!

123
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,420
Am I meant to be angry,
is that it, sir?

124
00:11:13,421 --> 00:11:15,380
Well, you ought to be.

125
00:11:15,381 --> 00:11:17,540
And if I find out a police
officer's responsible,

126
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,300
even in the slightest,
I'll be livid!

127
00:11:19,301 --> 00:11:21,020
I'm not. That's the problem.

128
00:11:21,021 --> 00:11:22,180
Problem?

129
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,861
I'd rather not investigate
the death of a former colleague.
I like keeping a distance.

130
00:11:27,141 --> 00:11:28,460
What about Steve?

131
00:11:28,461 --> 00:11:30,380
Well, I'll have to find him
a new partner

132
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:32,021
and I expect he won't like it.

133
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,101
Away you go.

134
00:11:51,621 --> 00:11:53,380
Sorry to keep you.

135
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:55,180
No problem, sir.

136
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:59,140
DC Georgina Trotman,
meet DS Steven Arnott.

137
00:11:59,141 --> 00:12:00,820
Steve, meet your new partner.

138
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:03,140
Actually, sir, it's Georgia.

139
00:12:03,141 --> 00:12:04,940
Georgia. Sorry.

140
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:06,820
Pleased to meet you. Likewise.

141
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:09,820
I've just been given
the operational parameters.

142
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:11,820
Witness Protection is off limits.

143
00:12:11,821 --> 00:12:13,500
For Christ's sake.

144
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:17,220
Yeah. Major Violent Crime are going
after the gunmen.

145
00:12:17,221 --> 00:12:21,740
So, AC-12's brief is to investigate
the suspicion that

146
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,140
information leakage
by a police officer

147
00:12:25,141 --> 00:12:27,380
is part of the set-up
of the ambush.

148
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:30,380
Sir... Steve. I get it. I get it.

149
00:12:30,381 --> 00:12:33,020
This is how Dryden wants it.
We get the 4th Street officers.

150
00:12:33,021 --> 00:12:34,700
Only one's still alive.

151
00:12:34,701 --> 00:12:36,540
So, you go after Denton.

152
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:37,980
Very good, sir.

153
00:12:37,981 --> 00:12:39,261
Thank you, you two.

154
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,180
Is she up to it?

155
00:12:50,181 --> 00:12:52,861
Get you, the Big I Am.

156
00:12:55,021 --> 00:12:56,900
Yes, I think so.

157
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,300
This investigation, sir...

158
00:12:58,301 --> 00:13:00,221
Aye, aye. That's the spirit.

159
00:13:06,381 --> 00:13:07,861
Welcome to AC-12.

160
00:13:40,701 --> 00:13:42,061
Morning, ma'am.

161
00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:08,780
How you faring, ma'am?

162
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:09,940
OK. Thanks.

163
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:12,741
Anythin' I can do, don't hesitate.
Cheers, sarge.

164
00:14:16,581 --> 00:14:18,221
Welcome back, Lindsay.

165
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:22,660
Sir.

166
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,621
You've been through a lot.
Just take it steady.

167
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:28,901
Thanks.

168
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:20,101
This one's taken.

169
00:15:23,101 --> 00:15:24,621
I said, "This one's taken."

170
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:39,341
No firearms! No backup!

171
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:43,421
It should be you we're burying,
you stupid bitch!

172
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:21,421
DI Royal. DI Denton.

173
00:17:11,861 --> 00:17:16,820
AC-12 interview - DI Lindsay Denton
and Federation rep DI Samuel Royal,

174
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:21,301
in the presence of Superintendent
Hastings, DS Arnott, DC Trotman.

175
00:17:22,861 --> 00:17:25,420
DI Denton, thank
you very much for coming in today.

176
00:17:25,421 --> 00:17:28,580
Let's be clear, you're being
interviewed today as a witness,

177
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:33,420
not as a suspect in any matters
of crime, discipline or misconduct.

178
00:17:33,421 --> 00:17:35,180
Whatever I can do to help, sir.

179
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:36,620
Thank you.

180
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:38,940
So, how did you come to be
involved in the operation

181
00:17:38,941 --> 00:17:42,260
that took place on the night
of September 5th?

182
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,340
Just bad luck.
I was on the ghost rota.

183
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:47,500
The Duty Sergeant took a call
and passed it on to me.

184
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:50,341
And what was said in that call?

185
00:17:51,741 --> 00:17:56,301
The caller identified
herself as DS Akers. DS Jayne Akers.

186
00:17:57,861 --> 00:18:01,100
Akers or the individual identifying
herself as Akers advised me

187
00:18:01,101 --> 00:18:04,701
that there was an immediate
and credible threat to the
life of a protected witness.

188
00:18:06,021 --> 00:18:08,740
Did she expand on the nature
of that threat?

189
00:18:08,741 --> 00:18:10,340
No, she did not.

190
00:18:10,341 --> 00:18:13,460
Did she give any indication as to
where the information came from?

191
00:18:13,461 --> 00:18:14,581
No, she did not.

192
00:18:16,701 --> 00:18:18,500
Go on.

193
00:18:18,501 --> 00:18:20,900
DS Akers requested assistance.

194
00:18:20,901 --> 00:18:22,740
You were the duty station?

195
00:18:22,741 --> 00:18:25,100
DI Denton is entitled to be
questioned by an officer

196
00:18:25,101 --> 00:18:27,460
at least one rank superior.

197
00:18:27,461 --> 00:18:29,420
There's no suspicion of DI Denton.

198
00:18:29,421 --> 00:18:32,981
She is being interviewed purely as a
witness. Yeah... Sam, it's all fine.

199
00:18:34,701 --> 00:18:37,580
We were the duty station as, at that
time, Akers and the witness were

200
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:40,540
located within the precinct of 4th
Street and the 4th Street Estate.

201
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,340
And did you share that
information with

202
00:18:42,341 --> 00:18:45,060
the officers
at 4th Street Station?

203
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:46,500
No, I did not, sir.

204
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:48,220
You did not?

205
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:49,580
Why not?

206
00:18:49,581 --> 00:18:52,860
DS Akers impressed on me the secure
nature of our communication,

207
00:18:52,861 --> 00:18:54,620
and that I should only
involve others

208
00:18:54,621 --> 00:18:56,620
when strictly operationally
necessary.

209
00:18:56,621 --> 00:18:59,340
I... I invented a cover story
involving

210
00:18:59,341 --> 00:19:01,540
the arrest of
a missing person suspect.

211
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,620
You shared the information
with no-one?

212
00:19:03,621 --> 00:19:06,980
I discussed the matter with
Deputy Chief Constable Dryden.

213
00:19:06,981 --> 00:19:09,781
I sought his approval
to render assistance.

214
00:19:11,221 --> 00:19:15,660
Didn't DS Akers advise you to
inform as few people as possible?

215
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:19,380
A critical incident response of that
type requires Gold approval, sir.

216
00:19:19,381 --> 00:19:20,581
Quite right.

217
00:19:21,781 --> 00:19:23,940
You always adhere to regulations?

218
00:19:23,941 --> 00:19:25,380
That's what they're there for.

219
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:29,220
I can see you and I are going to get
on like a house on fire, DI Denton!

220
00:19:29,221 --> 00:19:32,620
So, Deputy Chief Constable Dryden,

221
00:19:32,621 --> 00:19:35,300
what induced you to call him
in particular?

222
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:38,540
An incident occurred a few months
ago in which the Duty CS

223
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:42,340
failed to answer. DCC Dryden made it
clear that he could be

224
00:19:42,341 --> 00:19:44,500
contacted in such circumstances.

225
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:47,140
I... I think it was his way
of finding out which brass were

226
00:19:47,141 --> 00:19:49,181
pulling their weight
and which weren't.

227
00:19:50,661 --> 00:19:53,660
And why did you assign Wallis
and Butler?

228
00:19:53,661 --> 00:19:56,181
They were two officers
I knew by reputation.

229
00:19:57,461 --> 00:19:58,860
They could handle themselves.

230
00:19:58,861 --> 00:20:00,181
Two unarmed officers.

231
00:20:04,381 --> 00:20:05,621
No firearms?

232
00:20:06,661 --> 00:20:07,821
No backup?

233
00:20:08,901 --> 00:20:12,621
If there was anything I could do to
reverse that decision, sir...

234
00:20:14,621 --> 00:20:18,420
DI Denton's statement records
she was acting on

235
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:20,220
DS Akers' instructions.

236
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:23,540
Nobody's blaming you, I mean
if those were Akers' instructions.

237
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:26,500
I just thought you might think
they were...

238
00:20:26,501 --> 00:20:27,701
a bit irregular?

239
00:20:32,621 --> 00:20:36,420
You took the view it was
Akers' area of specialisation?

240
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:37,581
Exactly.

241
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:47,021
The ambush, ma'am,
must've been frightening.

242
00:20:48,741 --> 00:20:51,140
It was.

243
00:20:51,141 --> 00:20:53,700
You ever experienced
anything like that before?

244
00:20:53,701 --> 00:20:55,460
No. Thankfully.

245
00:20:55,461 --> 00:20:57,820
That's true, isn't it, DI Denton?

246
00:20:57,821 --> 00:20:59,580
You've held down a lot of desk jobs?

247
00:20:59,581 --> 00:21:01,220
You're a bit of a...

248
00:21:01,221 --> 00:21:03,340
backroom detective?

249
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:06,020
I believe I've done important work,
sir.

250
00:21:06,021 --> 00:21:07,381
Absolutely.

251
00:21:08,461 --> 00:21:10,020
Absolutely.

252
00:21:10,021 --> 00:21:12,060
You did well in a very testing
situation, ma'am.

253
00:21:12,061 --> 00:21:13,780
Thank you.

254
00:21:13,781 --> 00:21:16,740
You've never faced an anti-corruption
hearing, have you, ma'am?

255
00:21:16,741 --> 00:21:17,780
No.

256
00:21:17,781 --> 00:21:21,780
In 2002, DC Denton alleged
a colleague was falsifying

257
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,340
witness statements.

258
00:21:23,341 --> 00:21:26,420
The complaint was upheld -
the officer was disciplined.

259
00:21:26,421 --> 00:21:29,780
In 2007, DS Denton alleged
a colleague was making

260
00:21:29,781 --> 00:21:31,460
fraudulent expenses' claims.

261
00:21:31,461 --> 00:21:33,901
The complaint was upheld -
the officer was disciplined.

262
00:21:34,981 --> 00:21:37,660
DI Denton has demonstrated
the utmost probity throughout

263
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:39,021
her service career.

264
00:21:40,381 --> 00:21:44,380
It takes courage to make a moral
stand against your fellow officers,

265
00:21:44,381 --> 00:21:46,940
except sometimes
they don't see it that way.

266
00:21:46,941 --> 00:21:47,981
No.

267
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,500
I direct you to
document seven in your folder.

268
00:21:51,501 --> 00:21:55,180
Document seven, for the tape,
is a map showing

269
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:59,620
the location of the safe house,
the ambush and 4th Street Station.

270
00:21:59,621 --> 00:22:02,940
For the tape, I'm indicating
the route taken that night.

271
00:22:02,941 --> 00:22:05,620
Two unmarked police vehicles
departed the safe house.

272
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:08,900
And the most direct route to 4th
Street Station is via A roads.

273
00:22:08,901 --> 00:22:12,220
Instead, the vehicles travelled
along Crown Avenue and then
turned left

274
00:22:12,221 --> 00:22:16,101
into Long Lane, almost immediately
after which the ambush took place.

275
00:22:17,781 --> 00:22:19,500
Agreed and accepted?

276
00:22:19,501 --> 00:22:21,300
Agreed and accepted.

277
00:22:21,301 --> 00:22:24,781
A decision was taken not to go
the fastest way, via A roads.

278
00:22:26,021 --> 00:22:27,220
That's correct.

279
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:30,100
DI Denton was following
DS Akers' instructions.

280
00:22:30,101 --> 00:22:31,661
Akers' chose the route?

281
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:34,260
Yeah.

282
00:22:34,261 --> 00:22:37,540
This back route, it would
lead to 4th Street Station,

283
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:39,940
but only if you'd
continued along Crown Avenue.

284
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,941
The vehicles turned
left into Long Lane.

285
00:22:43,941 --> 00:22:44,981
Yeah.

286
00:22:46,621 --> 00:22:48,421
You didn't question that decision?

287
00:22:50,101 --> 00:22:51,900
No, sir.

288
00:22:51,901 --> 00:22:53,341
You had a radio, didn't you?

289
00:22:54,781 --> 00:22:55,820
Yeah.

290
00:22:55,821 --> 00:22:57,820
So, why didn't you question
the decision?

291
00:22:57,821 --> 00:23:00,340
Can we take a step back, please,

292
00:23:00,341 --> 00:23:04,540
and remind ourselves that DI Denton
is being interviewed as a witness?

293
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:06,621
Absolutely, absolutely.

294
00:23:09,341 --> 00:23:13,020
The decision appeared to make
sense at the time.

295
00:23:13,021 --> 00:23:15,820
There were roadworks
on Crown Avenue,

296
00:23:15,821 --> 00:23:21,380
erm, with temporary traffic signals
controlling a single lane.

297
00:23:21,381 --> 00:23:24,460
It was a potential hold-up
that would've left us vulnerable.

298
00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:27,300
There were no roadworks
on Crown Avenue that night.

299
00:23:27,301 --> 00:23:30,020
Works had been completed
the day before.

300
00:23:30,021 --> 00:23:31,700
I wasn't aware.

301
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:36,060
You didn't make a point of getting
up-to-date travel information?

302
00:23:36,061 --> 00:23:38,140
No.
You said Akers chose the route,

303
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:41,420
but you seem very familiar
with the arguments.

304
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:43,381
You were the ranking officer.

305
00:23:44,781 --> 00:23:47,421
You and Akers discussed
the route between you.

306
00:23:48,581 --> 00:23:50,061
That's more likely, isn't it?

307
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:54,701
Not more likely?

308
00:23:56,141 --> 00:23:57,621
I think we should stop there.

309
00:24:01,621 --> 00:24:04,061
Are you withdrawing
your cooperation, DI Denton?

310
00:24:07,861 --> 00:24:09,060
DI Denton?

311
00:24:09,061 --> 00:24:10,421
No, of course I cooperate.

312
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:14,140
Your vehicle was the only one
that wasn't shot at.

313
00:24:14,141 --> 00:24:16,940
They didn't need to.
They'd knocked my car off the road.

314
00:24:16,941 --> 00:24:18,301
I, erm...

315
00:24:19,661 --> 00:24:23,420
..I took cover inside
until they fled the scene.

316
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:25,460
You were in fear of your life.

317
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:27,180
Understandably.

318
00:24:27,181 --> 00:24:29,020
According to the
pathologist's report,

319
00:24:29,021 --> 00:24:32,420
Wallis and Butler died almost
instantly from gunshot wounds.

320
00:24:32,421 --> 00:24:34,700
But Akers
and her witness were alive.

321
00:24:34,701 --> 00:24:35,981
The witness...

322
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:38,860
..managed to put out the flames,

323
00:24:38,861 --> 00:24:40,101
but...

324
00:24:41,141 --> 00:24:44,540
Akers, she couldn't...

325
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:46,620
I, er...

326
00:24:46,621 --> 00:24:48,301
I threw my coat over her.

327
00:24:49,461 --> 00:24:50,661
Well done, ma'am.

328
00:24:52,621 --> 00:24:55,340
Did you help get them
out of the car?

329
00:24:55,341 --> 00:24:56,860
No.

330
00:24:56,861 --> 00:24:58,501
No?

331
00:25:01,461 --> 00:25:03,981
They came out themselves, sir.
They, er...

332
00:25:06,821 --> 00:25:09,021
..they, er,
they were already burning.

333
00:25:13,661 --> 00:25:16,541
I'm sorry.
That must've been a horrible sight.

334
00:25:17,661 --> 00:25:19,021
It was.

335
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:26,140
We all appreciate
that you've been...

336
00:25:26,141 --> 00:25:28,300
through the most terrible situation,

337
00:25:28,301 --> 00:25:30,261
but we have a job to do.

338
00:25:31,981 --> 00:25:34,100
What we're trying to get at here,
DI Denton,

339
00:25:34,101 --> 00:25:37,141
is how those gunmen knew where
you were that night.

340
00:25:38,941 --> 00:25:40,220
I wish I could help you, sir.

341
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:43,500
You do understand what we're
investigating here, don't you,
DI Denton?

342
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:45,900
The possibility
of information leakage.

343
00:25:45,901 --> 00:25:47,820
Yeah, I understand.

344
00:25:47,821 --> 00:25:50,060
And information leakage can only
happen in two ways -

345
00:25:50,061 --> 00:25:51,380
deliberately...

346
00:25:51,381 --> 00:25:53,620
Officer corruption -
they're in with the criminals.

347
00:25:53,621 --> 00:25:55,060
..or accidentally...

348
00:25:55,061 --> 00:25:57,660
Officer incompetence -
they fail to communicate securely.

349
00:25:57,661 --> 00:25:59,540
This interview has to stop.

350
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:01,540
If DI Denton is under suspicion,

351
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:04,500
you need to issue her with
a Regulation 15 Notice.

352
00:26:04,501 --> 00:26:06,220
This is still information gathering.

353
00:26:06,221 --> 00:26:08,460
We are a long way from a Reg 15.

354
00:26:08,461 --> 00:26:11,260
Under AC-12's blanket authority
to vet any officer connected to

355
00:26:11,261 --> 00:26:15,220
an ongoing investigation, we carried
out financial checks on DI Denton.

356
00:26:15,221 --> 00:26:17,341
I've requested that you stop.

357
00:26:19,581 --> 00:26:22,780
Our strongest suspicion is that
criminal interests tried to

358
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:26,060
assassinate the witness to stop him
from testifying.

359
00:26:26,061 --> 00:26:29,740
Now, those criminal interests
would pay a pretty penny

360
00:26:29,741 --> 00:26:32,740
for an inside man, or woman.

361
00:26:32,741 --> 00:26:35,900
And any officer in the financial
difficulties that you are in,

362
00:26:35,901 --> 00:26:39,020
DI Denton,
is duty-bound to declare it

363
00:26:39,021 --> 00:26:42,380
on the grounds that she would be
vulnerable to bribery.

364
00:26:42,381 --> 00:26:44,020
You're in debt up to your eyeballs.

365
00:26:44,021 --> 00:26:46,101
Stop the tape. We're finished here.

366
00:26:55,141 --> 00:26:57,981
My mother had to
go into a nursing home.

367
00:26:59,461 --> 00:27:04,100
And the council wouldn't pay, so we
sold her house but it wasn't enough.

368
00:27:04,101 --> 00:27:08,781
So, we sold mine,
but there was negative equity, so...

369
00:27:11,021 --> 00:27:13,580
..my mum is being looked after,
but I'm stuck with

370
00:27:13,581 --> 00:27:16,661
mortgage payments on a horrible
little place that I hate and...

371
00:27:17,981 --> 00:27:20,220
..you people... Lindsay, don't.

372
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,020
..you people, you sit there
and you try

373
00:27:22,021 --> 00:27:24,261
and twist some case
out of my misfortunes.

374
00:27:25,861 --> 00:27:30,301
All I did was do my job.
That's all I've ever done.

375
00:27:33,261 --> 00:27:36,220
I shouldn't have even
been on duty that night.

376
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:38,860
I'd do anything not to have been
there, not to have picked up

377
00:27:38,861 --> 00:27:41,260
that call, because for all
I know it's going to take away

378
00:27:41,261 --> 00:27:44,141
the one good thing in my life -
and that is being a police officer.

379
00:27:50,221 --> 00:27:52,140
That how it works here?

380
00:27:52,141 --> 00:27:53,860
Sometimes.

381
00:27:53,861 --> 00:27:56,780
You should've told me you were going
to treat her like a suspect.

382
00:27:56,781 --> 00:27:58,580
We weren't. She did that herself.

383
00:27:58,581 --> 00:28:00,100
She was defenceless in there.

384
00:28:00,101 --> 00:28:02,220
That's her rep's job, not ours.

385
00:28:02,221 --> 00:28:03,581
What's ours, then?

386
00:28:04,781 --> 00:28:06,660
Catching criminals.

387
00:28:06,661 --> 00:28:08,900
The criminals we
catch happen to be police officers.

388
00:28:08,901 --> 00:28:10,940
That's all there is to it.

389
00:28:10,941 --> 00:28:12,501
You think she's a criminal?

390
00:28:14,821 --> 00:28:16,740
Well?

391
00:28:16,741 --> 00:28:18,380
No.

392
00:28:18,381 --> 00:28:20,660
So, what gives you the right to
treat her like one?

393
00:28:20,661 --> 00:28:23,020
I've been through it.
That gives me the right.

394
00:28:23,021 --> 00:28:25,221
And having been through it,
it doesn't bother you?

395
00:28:27,381 --> 00:28:29,941
If this is not for you,
all you need to do is say.

396
00:28:33,301 --> 00:28:34,461
It's for me.

397
00:28:54,621 --> 00:28:57,420
Sergeant Alex Wallis
and Constable Vince Butler

398
00:28:57,421 --> 00:29:02,180
both leave behind them
families devastated by their loss.

399
00:29:02,181 --> 00:29:03,980
Who were the other casualties?

400
00:29:03,981 --> 00:29:08,140
A police detective was pronounced
dead shortly afterwards.

401
00:29:08,141 --> 00:29:10,580
A second police detective
suffered minor injuries.

402
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:13,341
We're withholding both their names
for operational reasons.

403
00:29:15,581 --> 00:29:19,140
Can you confirm reports that there
was another casualty? A civilian?

404
00:29:19,141 --> 00:29:20,940
No.

405
00:29:20,941 --> 00:29:22,820
"There's been
an attack on the police."

406
00:29:22,821 --> 00:29:25,061
Those were my words
on the night of the ambush.

407
00:29:27,381 --> 00:29:31,181
For the families that lost
their loved ones, the hurt goes on.

408
00:29:32,181 --> 00:29:36,420
For those of us
charged with finding their killers,

409
00:29:36,421 --> 00:29:40,380
we must set that pain aside
and proceed with clear minds.

410
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:44,461
And it's clear to me there's another
attack on the police...

411
00:29:45,621 --> 00:29:49,621
..an insidious and, ultimately,
more devastating one.

412
00:29:50,741 --> 00:29:53,220
Our numbers have been cut back.

413
00:29:53,221 --> 00:29:55,621
Public safety has been jeopardised.

414
00:29:56,941 --> 00:30:00,740
There's no clearer indicator than
the fact that on that night

415
00:30:00,741 --> 00:30:03,421
we weren't even able to
protect ourselves.

416
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:48,941
God asks us to forgive.

417
00:30:52,021 --> 00:30:54,780
But first we must gain justice

418
00:30:54,781 --> 00:30:56,581
for our fallen comrades.

419
00:30:59,221 --> 00:31:01,300
"Dearly beloved,

420
00:31:01,301 --> 00:31:03,141
"avenge not yourselves...

421
00:31:05,701 --> 00:31:08,860
"..but rather give place unto wrath.

422
00:31:08,861 --> 00:31:11,540
"For it is written,

423
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:13,060
" 'Vengeance is mine.

424
00:31:13,061 --> 00:31:15,340
" 'I will repay, '

425
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:16,861
"saith the Lord."

426
00:31:19,941 --> 00:31:23,460
Detective Sergeant Jayne Akers
leaves a loving husband,

427
00:31:23,461 --> 00:31:25,340
Richard Akers,

428
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:28,940
and many colleagues
devastated by her loss.

429
00:31:28,941 --> 00:31:30,940
The families of Sergeant Alex Wallis

430
00:31:30,941 --> 00:31:34,021
and Constable Vincent Butler
will miss them terribly...

431
00:31:35,781 --> 00:31:37,780
Sir.

432
00:31:37,781 --> 00:31:40,060
You called me that night.

433
00:31:40,061 --> 00:31:42,821
Yes, sir. How are you bearing up?

434
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:46,941
OK, thanks, sir.

435
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,740
Very sorry for your loss.

436
00:31:54,741 --> 00:31:56,981
Very sorry for your loss.
Thanks.

437
00:32:02,181 --> 00:32:03,821
Very sorry for your loss.

438
00:32:05,941 --> 00:32:07,661
Sorry. Sorry.

439
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:18,100
Hi, it's me. Look, I've got to
work late tonight, I'm sorry.

440
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:21,260
Yeah, would you mind getting
his stuff ready for school?

441
00:32:21,261 --> 00:32:25,141
Thanks, babe. Yeah, all right, then,
I'll speak to you in a bit, bye.

442
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:08,861
I'm sorry. What for?

443
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:14,941
For tonight. It doesn't matter much,
in the scheme of things.

444
00:34:20,581 --> 00:34:23,021
You two always used to end up
side by side.

445
00:34:33,861 --> 00:34:35,501
Do you think she ever knew?

446
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:41,941
When it mattered, she trusted us
both with her life.

447
00:34:46,821 --> 00:34:49,021
The night of the ambush,
she called me, to call you.

448
00:34:50,701 --> 00:34:52,300
To say what?

449
00:34:52,301 --> 00:34:55,101
For you to call her back about
the case she was working on.

450
00:34:56,901 --> 00:35:00,860
Why didn't she call me direct? Was
she worried her phone was tapped?

451
00:35:00,861 --> 00:35:03,541
If you'd answered, you could've
asked her yourself.

452
00:35:27,741 --> 00:35:30,620
'AC-12 interview, DI Lindsay Denton

453
00:35:30,621 --> 00:35:33,141
'and Federation rep
DI Samuel Royal...'

454
00:35:35,221 --> 00:35:37,820
Sorry, Tom, can I call you back?

455
00:35:37,821 --> 00:35:39,581
Five minutes, mate, cheers.

456
00:35:50,661 --> 00:35:52,181
I'm moving you up.

457
00:35:53,341 --> 00:35:55,060
Where?

458
00:35:55,061 --> 00:35:56,740
The 28s.

459
00:35:56,741 --> 00:35:58,300
Why?

460
00:35:58,301 --> 00:36:00,660
Quality Control are responding
to complaints that

461
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:04,020
non-high-priority missing persons
are being down-processed.

462
00:36:04,021 --> 00:36:05,541
We've got to be seen to take action.

463
00:36:07,781 --> 00:36:10,021
This is because
I didn't cover for you.

464
00:36:12,821 --> 00:36:16,021
I've got a room full of detectives
scoring fours and fives.

465
00:36:18,701 --> 00:36:21,141
After the balls-up of the ambush...

466
00:36:22,661 --> 00:36:25,540
..you're a two, at best.

467
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:27,900
I'm taking this to HR.

468
00:36:27,901 --> 00:36:31,381
Take it to Butler's missus,
Wallis' kids.

469
00:36:33,741 --> 00:36:35,221
Who's on this unit?

470
00:36:37,421 --> 00:36:39,580
You.

471
00:36:39,581 --> 00:36:41,300
And?

472
00:36:41,301 --> 00:36:43,180
I'll find some DC or other,

473
00:36:43,181 --> 00:36:45,021
if there's one who'll work with you.

474

those were Akers' instructions...

00:37:02,381 --> 00:37:03,741
'Yeah.

479
00:37:06,221 --> 00:37:08,581
'You didn't question that decision?

480
00:37:10,341 --> 00:37:11,861
'No, sir.'

481
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:25,180
Computer on the blink?

482
00:37:25,181 --> 00:37:26,861
I'm an old-fashioned girl.

483
00:37:29,941 --> 00:37:32,500
I listened to the tape.

484
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:35,460
I thought you didn't want to get
involved. Denton picked the route.

485
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:39,100
We don't know that. And tried to pin
it on Jayne Akers. She was nervous.

486
00:37:39,101 --> 00:37:41,781
Easiest ploy in the world -
blame the dead person.

487
00:37:52,261 --> 00:37:54,261
May I, sir? Sure.

488
00:38:29,021 --> 00:38:31,780
She said, "Just because I
reported him missing doesn't mean

489
00:38:31,781 --> 00:38:33,261
"I wanted him back."

490
00:38:35,661 --> 00:38:37,780
All right, who's for the pub? I am.

491
00:38:37,781 --> 00:38:39,541
Good, it's your round. OK.

492
00:39:20,621 --> 00:39:23,380
Thank you for making time
to see me today.

493
00:39:23,381 --> 00:39:26,340
As I told you on the telephone,
I'm heading up a newly formed unit

494
00:39:26,341 --> 00:39:29,420
that's taken over
the search for Carly.

495
00:39:29,421 --> 00:39:32,180
Anything we can do to help.
Before she went missing,

496
00:39:32,181 --> 00:39:35,340
did you notice anything unusual
about Carly's behaviour?

497
00:39:35,341 --> 00:39:37,820
She'd always been... difficult.

498
00:39:37,821 --> 00:39:40,380
A lot of them are that we take in.

499
00:39:40,381 --> 00:39:43,660
And how did her difficult nature
manifest itself?

500
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:46,660
You try and make them stay in school,
not go out late.

501
00:39:46,661 --> 00:39:49,340
If they go out,
maybe it's the pictures or...

502
00:39:49,341 --> 00:39:51,900
Carly drifted back
into her old ways,

503
00:39:51,901 --> 00:39:54,340
or what they said
were her old ways -

504
00:39:54,341 --> 00:39:58,060
out late, drinking, smoking...
boys, too.

505
00:39:58,061 --> 00:40:01,260
We found a used condom in her room.

506
00:40:01,261 --> 00:40:03,381
We did our best not to
push her away...

507
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:26,940
Yeah? Just wanted to ask you
a couple of questions, ma'am.

508
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:29,140
Which should take place
following legal notice

509
00:40:29,141 --> 00:40:31,180
and in the presence of
my Police Federation Rep.

510
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:34,100
We can do all that if you prefer,
ma'am, but you're being interviewed

511
00:40:34,101 --> 00:40:37,660
as a witness, not a suspect.
Yeah, I've heard that one before.

512
00:40:37,661 --> 00:40:40,100
We had a job to do. I'm sorry.

513
00:40:40,101 --> 00:40:42,940
But thanks to your cooperation,
our investigation's moving on.

514
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,140
Look, this isn't a trap, ma'am.

515
00:40:45,141 --> 00:40:48,340
You're the last living person
to have had contact with DS Akers.

516
00:40:48,341 --> 00:40:50,821
We need to form a view of her
mental state that night.

517
00:40:52,261 --> 00:40:53,661
All right.

518
00:41:06,901 --> 00:41:08,900
How was she behaving?

519
00:41:08,901 --> 00:41:10,301
She was...

520
00:41:11,981 --> 00:41:14,100
She was on edge.

521
00:41:14,101 --> 00:41:17,540
Nervous. I'd say very nervous.

522
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,780
Did she give any reason why she
wasn't in contact with her own team?

523
00:41:20,781 --> 00:41:21,980
No, she didn't.

524
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:23,341
Did she refer to any process?

525
00:41:24,861 --> 00:41:27,340
Sorry, gaffer, you said you
wanted these straightaway.

526
00:41:27,341 --> 00:41:29,100
That's all right, thank you.

527
00:41:29,101 --> 00:41:31,861
That's my new DC, Kate Foster. Hi.

528
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:37,980
You were saying?

529
00:41:37,981 --> 00:41:40,460
Did DS Akers refer to any process
of clearing her actions

530
00:41:40,461 --> 00:41:42,820
with her superiors? No, she didn't.

531
00:41:42,821 --> 00:41:46,380
Did she discuss any role played by
other members of her team?

532
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:48,100
No, she didn't.

533
00:41:48,101 --> 00:41:51,460
As far as you could tell,
who was DS Akers working with?

534
00:41:51,461 --> 00:41:55,661
As far as I could tell... DS Akers
appeared to be working alone.

535
00:41:57,061 --> 00:41:59,501
That's been very helpful.
Thank you, ma'am.

536
00:42:13,541 --> 00:42:17,060
I asked Kate to check out
the operational options.

537
00:42:17,061 --> 00:42:20,540
Neither of us suspected she'd
get embedded so quickly.

538
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:23,220
There was an unfilled
post for Denton's DC.

539
00:42:23,221 --> 00:42:27,500
Yeah, well, a heads-up would have
been nice. Do you want a row?

540
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:30,580
What the hell were you doing there,
anyway, interviewing Denton again?

541
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:33,901
We're not allowed to investigate
Akers, so I asked Denton about her.

542
00:42:35,741 --> 00:42:37,861
Full marks for ingenuity, son.

543
00:42:38,901 --> 00:42:41,980
Supposing Akers was
the inside woman.

544
00:42:41,981 --> 00:42:43,301
Sorry, Steve.

545
00:42:45,381 --> 00:42:46,781
All right? Hi.

546
00:42:47,861 --> 00:42:49,500
Thanks for coming.

547
00:42:49,501 --> 00:42:51,501
Steve, meet the trouble and strife.

548
00:42:55,021 --> 00:42:56,660
Have you been here before, Steve?

549
00:42:56,661 --> 00:42:59,900
I haven't, no. It looks a nice place.
Yeah. We've heard some good things,

550
00:42:59,901 --> 00:43:02,060
haven't we, love? Oh,
and speaking of good things.

551
00:43:02,061 --> 00:43:04,780
I'm not late, am I? Sorry, sorry.

552
00:43:04,781 --> 00:43:06,580
I'm Roisin. Georgia.

553
00:43:06,581 --> 00:43:09,381
Drink, Steve? I'm still on
this beer, thanks. Georgia?

554
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:12,860
If anyone fancies wine...

555
00:43:12,861 --> 00:43:15,180
Yep. Wine list, please.
Oh. You're on beer.

556
00:43:15,181 --> 00:43:16,780
Do you want one?

557
00:43:16,781 --> 00:43:18,741
Sorry, a beer here, please.

558
00:43:20,701 --> 00:43:23,460
So, Steve's been in
AC for a year now

559
00:43:23,461 --> 00:43:26,700
and every day has
felt like a lifetime.

560
00:43:26,701 --> 00:43:28,980
That'd make me about your age, sir.

561
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:31,900
He also likes the banter,
the cheeky wee b... Ted.

562
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:35,180
"Boy" - I was going to say,
"Cheeky, wee boy."

563
00:43:35,181 --> 00:43:37,780
You're new to Ted's unit?

564
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,580
Transferred from Armed Robbery.

565
00:43:39,581 --> 00:43:41,780
You'll be at home here, then...

566
00:43:41,781 --> 00:43:43,141
with these prices.

567
00:43:44,301 --> 00:43:45,741
Thanks.

568
00:44:33,501 --> 00:44:36,020
That was very generous, thanks, sir.
Thanks, sir.

569
00:44:36,021 --> 00:44:38,620
Pleasure. Lovely meeting you both.

570
00:44:38,621 --> 00:44:40,460
See you tomorrow, then.

571
00:44:40,461 --> 00:44:42,540
Night. Night-night.
Night-night.

572
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:43,781
Night, boss. Night.

573
00:44:48,421 --> 00:44:50,500
Do you need a lift?

574
00:44:50,501 --> 00:44:52,780
Bus stop's just here.

575
00:44:52,781 --> 00:44:53,981
Well, I'm that way.

576
00:44:55,781 --> 00:44:57,301
You OK to drive?

577
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:06,421
Do you fancy a nightcap?

578
00:45:11,621 --> 00:45:15,260
What are you having? I'll get these.
I insist. All right. Beer.

579
00:45:15,261 --> 00:45:17,420
Whatever they've got.

580
00:45:17,421 --> 00:45:22,460
Pint of, er, Peroni,
half of Pilsner...

581
00:45:22,461 --> 00:45:23,981
and a double vodka.

582
00:45:40,781 --> 00:45:42,101
Thank you for that.

583
00:45:51,021 --> 00:45:53,221
You always wanted to try the place.

584
00:46:06,061 --> 00:46:08,501
I got you out in false pretences?
Is that it?

585
00:46:11,021 --> 00:46:14,221
I didn't detect any pressing reason
for keeping up appearances.

586
00:46:16,341 --> 00:46:17,861
I'm their boss.

587
00:46:20,381 --> 00:46:24,101
And picking up the bill -
that really took the prize!

588
00:46:25,501 --> 00:46:27,141
For my benefit, was it?

589
00:46:40,821 --> 00:46:42,860
Bottles now?

590
00:46:42,861 --> 00:46:45,341
Work in the morning.
Oh, that little thing.

591
00:46:52,221 --> 00:46:53,780
When I first arrived,

592
00:46:53,781 --> 00:46:57,180
what did you say to Hastings,
when you were alone in the office?

593
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:59,021
Just talking operational parameters.

594
00:47:00,181 --> 00:47:02,660
You're such a crap liar.

595
00:47:02,661 --> 00:47:04,941
Look, I just wanted to know
more about you.

596
00:47:06,981 --> 00:47:08,820
All right.

597
00:47:08,821 --> 00:47:12,540
Here are three facts about me
but one of them is false.

598
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:14,820
You've bitten off more
than you can chew, Trotman.

599
00:47:14,821 --> 00:47:18,100
I do this for a living.
Well, let's see, shall we?

600
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:19,901
I'm a gifted horsewoman.

601
00:47:21,181 --> 00:47:24,540
I won a poetry competition
when I was 11.

602
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:26,461
I'm a secret pool hustler.

603
00:47:31,741 --> 00:47:34,341
You don't know one end of
a pool cue from the other.

604
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:06,100
Is it so hard to comprehend,

605
00:48:06,101 --> 00:48:08,621
a man wanting to spend
the evening with his wife?

606
00:48:14,821 --> 00:48:16,301
This hurts me, too.

607
00:48:45,781 --> 00:48:50,101
This is a really stupid idea.
Yeah, best not. Best not.

608
00:48:52,341 --> 00:48:54,221
Which was the false one by the way?

609
00:48:56,821 --> 00:48:58,261
A girl never tells.

610
00:49:54,141 --> 00:49:55,541
What do you want?

611
00:50:02,941 --> 00:50:07,101
I...will... not... take... it...
any... more.

612
00:50:59,461 --> 00:51:01,500
Yeah, thanks for that.
Stay in touch.

613
00:51:01,501 --> 00:51:02,781
Cheers.

614
00:51:09,381 --> 00:51:12,460
News from the hospital. The docs
are going to try the witness

615
00:51:12,461 --> 00:51:15,060
off the ventilator later on today.
He's on the mend.

616
00:51:15,061 --> 00:51:16,420
When do we get to interview him?

617
00:51:16,421 --> 00:51:18,420
Oh, rest assured,
our foot is in the door.

618
00:51:18,421 --> 00:51:21,420
If anyone's got answers
to the questions, he has.

619
00:51:21,421 --> 00:51:24,541
Good craic last night, you two. Huh?

620
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:38,861
This is so reductive.

621
00:51:41,581 --> 00:51:45,420
I'm concerned there's a news vacuum,
and what'll be used to fill it.

622
00:51:45,421 --> 00:51:48,260
The Chief Constable's as concerned
as I am about any leak

623
00:51:48,261 --> 00:51:51,420
that a police officer
might've been an accomplice.

624
00:51:51,421 --> 00:51:55,580
We're looking at using anti-terror
legislation to keep a lid on it.

625
00:51:55,581 --> 00:51:58,580
You can't invite them to dinner
and not serve pudding.

626
00:51:58,581 --> 00:52:02,220
I need a breakthrough.
I didn't say that.

627
00:52:02,221 --> 00:52:04,541
We need to keep the bastards
onside, that's all.

628
00:52:15,221 --> 00:52:17,340
Are you any nearer finding
those responsible?

629
00:52:17,341 --> 00:52:19,860
We're pursuing several,
productive lines of inquiry.

630
00:52:19,861 --> 00:52:22,340
I'm very pleased with the progress
of the investigation.

631
00:52:22,341 --> 00:52:23,981
Yeah. But do you have any suspects?

632
00:52:27,581 --> 00:52:29,141

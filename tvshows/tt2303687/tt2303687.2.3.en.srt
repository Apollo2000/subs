1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:06,050
- DI Denton.
- DS Jayne Akers, calling
with request for urgent assistance.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,810
Immediate and credible threat
to life.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,460
I need a safe and available
destination, ASAP.

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,690
There's been an attack on the police.

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,610
Three of our colleagues have lost
their lives in the line of duty.

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,930
You called me that night.

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,420
Yes, sir.

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,650
I shouldn't have even
been on duty that night.

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,210
I'd do anything not to have been
there, not to have picked up

10
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,570
that call, because for all I know
it's going to take away

11
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,570
the one good thing in my life, and
that is being a police officer.

12
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,250
I'm heading up a newly-formed unit
that's taken over

13
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,820
the search for Carly Kirk.

14
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,090
Oh!

15
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,930
- DS Arnott, AC-12?
- Boss.

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,580
People have underestimated me
my whole life.

17
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,530
I'll open up Witness Protection
to your team.

18
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,090
There's a DI in AC-9.

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,970
He's your man. You'll second him.

20
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,210
As you wish, sir.

21
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,380
Whatever it takes to nail
those bastards.

22
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,130
Your call history makes for very
interesting reading.

23
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,450
The night of the ambush
she called me to call you.

24
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,810
To say what?

25
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,660
For you to call her back about
the case she was working on.

26
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,930
This is the home
under protective custody,

27
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,730
of staff nurse Claire Tindall.

28
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,530
You interviewed her in connection
with events at the hospital.

29
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,060
There are more photos.

30
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,170
The protected witness.
The wee gobshite this was all about.

31
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,540
Christ!

32
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,410
DI Denton, I'm arresting you for
conspiracy to murder

33
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,700
a protected witness.

34
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,370
What was in the witness protection
files?

35
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,500
Oh, my God. Was it someone you knew?

36
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,380
I'm innocent. You know I am.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,074

38
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,580
All rise.

39
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,580
Remain standing.

40
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,850
Are you Lindsay Elizabeth Denton?

41
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,050
(Yes.)

42
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,650
Please speak up so we can hear you.

43
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,890
Yes.

44
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,220
Sit down, Ms Denton.

45
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,900
Morning, Ms Latimer.

46
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,210
Your Honour, the defendant is
charged with conspiracy to murder.

47
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,730
This is a very serious charge
arising from a complex investigation

48
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,700
by Anti-Corruption Unit 12.

49
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,540
A 36-year-old woman has been charged
with conspiracy to murder.

50
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,130
There are rumours the victim
was a protected witness

51
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,090
granted immunity from prosecution.

52
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,170
No further details will be
disclosed at present.

53
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,090
The charging of the 36-year-old woman
is a highly significant breakthrough,

54
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,130
and we're confident that more
arrests will follow.

55
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,650
Nick Ronson, from the Evening Post.

56
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,170
Thanks. Do you think the Witness
Protection Scheme

57
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,500
is fit for purpose?

58
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,820
No comment. Thank you all.

59
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,970
Well handled, sir.

60
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,180
Cheers, Les.

61
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,130
Champion.

62
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,450
You're the new Media Manager?
Jo Wright.

63
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,180
New Jo. Have you got a minute?
Sure.

64
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,290
There's a false speeding
story about me...

65
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,050
With this arrest, sir, it's dead.

66
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,170
Good. A stupid, pointless
distraction.

67
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,410
Oh, and civilians don't have
to call me sir.

68
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,130
I'd feel uncomfortable not
respecting your rank.

69
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,810
OK. Great.

70
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,890
Is there to be a bail application?
Yes, Your Honour.

71
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,250
Your Honour, the prosecution opposes
bail on the following grounds.

72
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,250
The seriousness of the offence,
the defendant has the means

73
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,450
and knowledge to abscond from
justice.

74
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,810
Your Honour, the defendant is
a serving police officer

75
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,970
of excellent standing.

76
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,580
She has no desire to abscond.
She intends to clear her name.

77
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,290
I'm refusing bail.

78
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,780
You will be remanded in custody
until the 18th of November.

79
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,860
All rise.

80
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,260
What about Bella?

81
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,780
Has anyone got an evidence
bag for this?

82
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,170
Answering only yes or no,
do you understand spoken English?

83
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,810
Yes.

84
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,090
Answering only yes or no,
are you Lindsay Elizabeth Denton?

85
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,050
Yes. Answering only yes or no,

86
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,570
are you currently suffering from an
infectious disease?

87
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,850
No.

88
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,970
Answering only yes or no,

89
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,250
are you currently suffering from a
sexually transmitted disease?

90
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,290
No.

91
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,090
Answering only yes or no, are you
or could you be pregnant?

92
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,250
No.

93
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,450
You'll reside in
the Vulnerable Persons Unit.

94
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,610
You will be in a cell on your own
and you will have

95
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,970
minimal association with
the other residents.

96
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,020
Answering only yes or no,
do you understand? Yes.

97
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,730
When an Offender Management Officer
enters your cell,

98
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,810
she'll order you to move
away from the door.

99
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,090
Answering only yes or no,
do you understand?

100
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,850
Yeah.

101
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,210
If you maintain good behaviour,
you may request a television set,

102
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,170
the cost at Â£2 per week to be
taken out of your allowance.

103
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,420
Can I request
a piano keyboard, please?

104
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,850
Answering only yes or no,

105
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,100
would you like to request
a television set? No.

106
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,980
Move away from the door.

107
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,650
Oh, what's that tosser doing here?
Buggered if I know.

108
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,330
Morning, you two.
Morning, sir.

109
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,380
Sir, what's he doing here?
Oh, yeah...

110
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,770
Look, our investigation has expanded
into Witness Protection.

111
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,890
The Deputy Chief Constable ordered
me to bring on

112
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,290
a specialist from AC-9.

113
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,090
Those bastards have been
keeping us out.

114
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,890
AC-9 did not make the call, Steve.

115
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,290
Dot Cottan certainly did not
make the call.

116
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,930
This has come directly from the
office

117
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,290
of the Deputy Chief Constable.

118
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,290
I'm not saying you should've run it
by us first.

119
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,250
I'm glad you're not saying that,
Steve, because that shows you're not

120
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,410
confused about who's in charge here.

121
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,730
Come on, give him a chance.

122
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,450
The Tony Gates team was disbanded,

123
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,210
Cottan went on to distinguish
himself, got himself a promotion,

124
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,850
and the fact of the matter is he was
the only officer in that unit

125
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,370
who was prepared to stand up and
give evidence against his boss.

126
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,340
He's a born Anti-Corruption Officer,
poacher turned gamekeeper.

127
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,330
Move away from the door!

128
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,970
The dirty bastards put shit in my
food. Don't you people check?

129
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,020
Answering yes or no,
don't you people check?

130
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,530
The target of the 5th September
ambush was a protected witness.

131
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,050
To fill you in on the details,

132
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,970
I'd like to introduce you to
Detective Inspector Matthew Cottan.

133
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,940
Thank you, Matt.
Thanks a lot, sir.

134
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,530
In June of 2012,

135
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,730
a double murder at Greek Lane,
Moss Heath,

136
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,250
that was originally thought to have
been drug-related,

137
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,260
was recrimed as a terrorist
incident.

138
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:48,610
This individual is
John Thomas Hunter.

139
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,010
He used the name Tommy and had
proven links with organised crime.

140
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,970
Tommy co-operated with the
investigation

141
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,690
into the Greek Lane terror incident

142
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,290
in return for immunity from
prosecution.

143
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,220
Tommy was the target of the ambush.

144
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,450
Having been enrolled in the
Witness Protection programme,

145
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,170
he was given a new identity as
Alex Campbell

146
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,220
and relocated to a safe house at
12 St James's Close.

147
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,490
On the night of September 5th
his Witness Protection Officer,

148
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,330
DS Jayne Akers, notified an
immediate threat against her witness

149
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:29,130
and attempted to move him into safe
custody at 4th Street Station.

150
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,610
As we all know, Akers was killed

151
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:34,650
and the witness received
critical injuries.

152
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,970
A second, successful attempt
on his life was made

153
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,850
at the General Hospital
nine days later. Yes?

154
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,980
No prosecutions resulted from
the Greek Lane counter-terror op.

155
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,330
As a result, as I was going on
to say,

156
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,650
the witness's immunity was
in jeopardy.

157
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,810
The only way for him to stay out of
prison was to prove his value.

158
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,930
So you think this got back to the
witness's criminal associates,

159
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,010
which prompted their plan
to silence him?

160
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,210
Exactly that, sir. Yeah.

161
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,140
DS Akers was the person closest
to the witness, trusted by him.

162
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,020
So if he was going to name names,
she'd be the one to know.

163
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,460
What?

164
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,290
DS Akers was killed in the ambush.

165
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,410
How'd it fit that
she betrayed Tommy?

166
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,130
Well, unknown to Akers,

167
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,380
she may also have been the target of
the ambush, killed for her silence.

168
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,220
Sounds like a guess.

169
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,690
I'd call it a working hypothesis.

170
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,730
We've charged DI Lindsay Denton.

171
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,890
AC-9 wouldn't happen to be sitting
on a connection

172
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,370
between Tommy and Denton?
Not that I know of.

173
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:41,810
Yet. Which is why we are pooling
our resources. Thank you, Matthew.

174
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,850
Thanks, sir.

175
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,610
Assignments in respect of
the foregoing

176
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,660
will come via me or DI Cottan.
Thank you. That is all.

177
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,450
Also before you go. I've got some
hand-outs, should anybody want one.

178
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,780
For Christ's sake.

179
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,060
Kindly take a seat and your event
will commence shortly.

180
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,970
Hello, Inspector, how are you?

181
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,980
Hmm. Tickety-boo.

182
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,330
I need to conduct a further interview
in regard to the ambush

183
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,100
on the night of September 5th.

184
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,890
You remain under caution.

185
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,530
There are strict rules for
post-charge interview.

186
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,330
One of which is for the detainee to
have put to them information

187
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,130
which has come to light
since they were charged.

188
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,820
In the interests of justice.

189
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,570
Go on.

190
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,290
Who was DS Akers' protected witness?
I don't know. I never knew.

191
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,060
You never saw him,
never heard a name? No.

192
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,900
Have you ever seen this man before?

193
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,180
No.

194
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,490
Fine. Have it your own way.

195
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,980
Is that the new information?
Was that the witness?

196
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,770
Fine. End of conversation.

197
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,690
Why didn't you reveal to Hastings and
Arnott that I'd received a call

198
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,250
off DS Akers' husband on the night of
the ambush?

199
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,690
I didn't need to. No?

200
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,810
No. Hastings makes Greece
look solvent

201
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,610
and Arnott can't keep it
in his pants.

202
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,580
Their transgressions are minor
in comparison. Irrelevant.

203
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,050
How did you figure out I was
an undercover officer?

204
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,970
What, I give you tips so you can do
a better job

205
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,970
on the next innocent officer
that you go after?

206
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,660
I did a good enough job on you.

207
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,530
You want me on a string,

208
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,690
wondering when you're going
to screw up my career.

209
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,410
You don't like it when the shoe's
on the other foot, do you, Kate?

210
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,330
Let me explain something to you,
Inspector.

211
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,410
You're facing a charge of conspiracy
to murder. That's a life sentence.

212
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,450
I'm not going to be in here
for life. I'm innocent

213
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,690
and I'm going to clear my name

214
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,930
and that will become apparent at
the trial. If we get that far.

215
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,770
We will.
Is this what you want, Kate?

216
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,570
Wouldn't it be better if you went
out and found the actual culprit,

217
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,570
and got all the charges against me
dropped? The evidence points at you.

218
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,850
Circumstantial evidence.

219
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,810
The CPS buy it. So will the courts.
Yeah, the courts,

220
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,530
where it's going to come out that
you're connected to the person

221
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,570
who's much more likely to have
set up the ambush.

222
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,090
There's no connection. You know what,
you're a good liar, Kate.

223
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,330
Not good enough to fool me
when you were undercover,

224
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,730
but good enough to hide that call.

225
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:25,690
I'm so glad you did, cos you've made
yourself my ticket out of here.

226
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,530
Well, whilst you're in here,
bouncing off the walls,

227
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,730
our investigation rolls on,
day after day,

228
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,090
gathering more evidence against you.

229
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,410
For one, we'll find out
the real reason why you were

230
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,410
sniffing around that garage.

231
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,140
I told you. We'll see.

232
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:03,090
We've both been here before.
So has Major Violent Crime.

233
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,810
What matters is Denton came here.

234
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,010
Yeah, following a missing persons
lead.

235
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,490
This is the exact place
used by Tommy's killer.

236
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,050
If that isn't a possible connection
between the two of them,

237
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,140
I don't know what is.

238
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,820
What?

239
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,130
I searched this place.
It was flat.

240
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,500
Well, it's not any more.

241
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,050
Get the landlord on the phone.

242
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,330
We need consent to get
a search team over here.

243
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,250
Let's see what
comes from the garage.

244
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,690
But now we've got access to
the witness protection files,

245
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,810
we've got Tommy.

246
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,050
We've got Akers, who was his WP
officer, and her phone records.

247
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,650
And then we've got Denton.

248
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,250
But nothing in either the files
or the phone history connects

249
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,530
either party to Denton.

250
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,930
All right?

251
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,810
All right.

252
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,900
You all right?

253
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,660
So, Gaffer says you were
probies with Akers.

254
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,930
Yeah, I went through Ryton with her.
Honest copper?

255
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,140
Yeah.

256
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,490
What?

257
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,010
We're playing catch-up.

258
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,090
Feels like everybody else got
first dibs on this one.

259
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,370
First thing we did was look for
prior contact

260
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,130
between Akers and Denton.

261
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,690
They never worked together,
they never called each other.

262
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,210
As far as we can tell,
they were complete strangers,

263
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,850
never met until a few
minutes before the ambush.

264
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,370
As per Denton's statement.
Yeah.

265
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,090
There's a hell of a lot of evidence
against Denton.

266
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,700
Oh, yeah, you're right. There is.

267
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,410
Look, the gaffer's asked me
to do a job.

268
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,610
It's not my fault you were kept
out of the loop.

269
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:05,980
But really, around the office,
you ought to be calling me sir.

270
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,890
Sir.

271
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,060
Sir.

272
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,580
Good. Have a nice day.

273
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,570
Wanker.

274
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,660
Twat.

275
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,770
OK.

276
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,410
According to Akers' phone records,
a few minutes beforehand,

277
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,010
she called a number registered
to her husband.

278
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,810
She calls home, says, "I might be a
little bit late tonight, love,"

279
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,770
and then arranges the transfer
via Denton.

280
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,970
Makes sense, but let's
talk to the husband anyway.

281
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,690
Good idea.
I'll call him.

282
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,330
No, it's fine, I'll do it.

283
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,850
Do you mind if we set the interview
up for tomorrow though?

284
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,140
Cos my Tesco's shuts at eight.
All right.

285
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,300
Hi.

286
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,530
In the morning, I'm going to
return to take a statement

287
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,090
with my partner, Steve Arnott.

288
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,450
You'll answer all our questions
fully and honestly,

289
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,930
with the exception of disclosing
Jayne's request for you

290
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,220
to contact me and the fact that you
did attempt to contact me.

291
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,810
Right. OK.
OK.

292
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,930
Kate...

293
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,740
I get it.

294
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,420
Last thing I want to do
is embarrass you.

295
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,540
You picked a good day, Ted.

296
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,010
We've got Bourbon Creams.

297
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,140
Thanks very much, sir, but I'm fine.

298
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,820
Why didn't you notify me
you were arresting DI Denton?

299
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,570
I didn't realise I had to, sir.

300
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,890
I thought we agreed
we were on the same team.

301
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,210
We are, sir,

302
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,050
it's just there's the principle of
non-reciprocity between...

303
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,850
I'm managing one of the biggest
cases, if not the biggest,

304
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,770
this force has ever seen.

305
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,260
Every move's being watched
like a hawk.

306
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,970
And may I ask if there's
any difficulty

307
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,660
with Denton's arrest, sir?

308
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,900
No, of course not.

309
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,500
You did the right thing.

310
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,930
Luckily, we've managed to play this
development in our favour.

311
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,330
It's just that you would've
appreciated some forewarning, sir.

312
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,010
That's all it is.

313
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,290
Well, if I could just beg another
minute of your time, please, sir.

314
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,330
Quickly.

315
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,610
I'm going to send you the audio file
of the interview

316
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,330
with DI Denton in which you'll hear
her levelling accusations

317
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:33,090
intended to discredit
two AC-12 officers.

318
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,290
DS Stephen Arnott

319
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,130
is accused of having a liaison
with a witness, sir.

320
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,220
It happens.

321
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,540
OK. The second officer?

322
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,450
Well, that would be me, sir.

323
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,090
DI Denton obtained my financial
records and is accusing me

324
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:54,490
of having high levels of undisclosed
financial losses, sir.

325
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,890
Her actions in obtaining those
records are, in my opinion,

326
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,170
unlawful, sir, but however,

327
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,180
the information she has against me
is correct.

328
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,380
I'm sorry. How did it happen?

329
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,810
A retired colleague invited me
to invest in a property deal

330
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,010
in the Irish Republic.

331
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,340
I meant, how did
she access your records?

332
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,740
That's still under
investigation, sir.

333
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,450
You're aware the prosecutor's going
for public interest immunity

334
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,330
against DI Denton?
I am, sir.

335
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,850
And there's a chance they'll umbrella
AC-12's evidence

336
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,610
with Witness Protection.

337
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,490
It's possible this could all end up
being brushed under the carpet.

338
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,340
That's out of my hands, sir.

339
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,370
This must've been difficult
for you, Ted.

340
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,900
It shows your integrity.

341
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,010
Notwithstanding, I'm going
to have to consider

342
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,460
how it affects your position.

343
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,460
Of course, sir.

344
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,620
Thank you, sir.

345
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,890
Mr Akers, I'm DS Arnott.
DC Fleming you know.

346
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,140
Hi. Hi, Kate. Hi.

347
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,490
Come in.

348
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,140
You two seen each other since...
The funeral? No.

349
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,010
I'm, er... I'm very sorry
for your loss.

350
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,850
Jayne left for work as normal
that morning.

351
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,370
She didn't say anything
about there being anything

352
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:29,690
unusual that she had to do that day.

353
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,850
Did your wife ever discuss
the particular witness

354
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,730
she was dealing with?
Not a word. Jayne didn't do that.

355
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,930
DI Lindsay Denton. That a name
you ever heard from your wife?

356
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,250
No.

357
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,130
According to your wife's
phone records,

358
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,370
she made a telephone call at exactly
8:43pm that evening.

359
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,620
That your number?

360
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,650
My mobile, yes.

361
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,260
Do you recall what she said?

362
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,650
She said that something
had come up at work

363
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,290
and that she was going
to be home late.

364
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,380
She said she'd call me later and let
me know how things were going.

365
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,340
That's all?

366
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,700
To the best of my recollection.

367
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,930
Thank you, Mr Akers. We know
this is a difficult time for you.

368
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,530
Your assistance has been valuable.

369
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,740
I'll see you out.

370
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,610
Sorry, Mr Akers.

371
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,250
If someone's in fear of their life,
a police officer,

372
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,610
then they do something about it.

373
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:34,050
Was there anything she said,
an unusual turn of phrase,

374
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,820
a name, anything, that might alert
someone to what was going on?

375
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,370
There wasn't, no.

376
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,660
Thanks again, Mr Akers.

377
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,260
A word.

378
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:24,010
You got something to say about the
interview with Akers' husband?

379
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,820
Writing up the statement
for the boss.

380
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,930
He's made me Deputy SIO

381
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,090
so I'll take a look at it
when it's ready.

382
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,850
Congratulations.

383
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,530
You're worried it doesn't fit, hmm?

384
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,490
Akers makes a random phone call to
Denton, and yet it's all Denton?

385
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,530
That's why we're
looking for connections.

386
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,660
Our side and your side,
and we haven't found one.

387
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:51,810
Have you seen the preliminaries
on the search of Denton's house?

388
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,730
Not one piece of incriminating
evidence.

389
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,250
But I'm guessing summat wasn't right
with Akers' husband?

390
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,620
Cup of tea.

391
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,500
Look, I've put in a request
for financial forensics for...

392
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:12,490
I've put in a request for financial
forensics for Akers' bank account.

393
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,530
If she was getting
paid for information.

394
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,410
Great minds think alike. Nice one.

395
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,690
Well, Denton's in custody.
How's the boss going to react?

396
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,010
Don't know, mate.

397
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,930
I'm not sure how I feel about
sending an innocent copper down.

398
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,620
I need my eight hours a night.

399
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,570
Steve, what was that?

400
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,660
Nothing. He's a twat.

401
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,220
Stephen.

402
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,260
Sir.

403
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,340
Shut the door.

404
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,260
Remain standing.

405
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,250
I've been trying to figure out the
best way of dealing with this matter

406
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,770
and frankly, I'd rather not have to.

407
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,290
And I don't fancy talking to this
nurse about what happened

408
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,290
between the pair of you.
So I'll start with you.

409
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,130
This isn't relevant
to our investigation.

410
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,450
Yes, it is, because we have
Denton on tape quoting the regs.

411
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,290
She was clutching at straws.
She'll say anything to undermine us.

412
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,770
Why don't you let me
be the judge of that?

413
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,730
The nurse isn't a witness against
Denton.

414
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,130
She's never even heard of her.

415
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,090
Did you have inappropriate
relations with a witness?

416
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,130
As I've said, sir,
she's not a witness.

417
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,090
Not our witness, anyway, and MVC
aren't charging her as an accessory.

418
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,330
So what are you saying, son?
What, she was fair game?

419
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,330
I'm saying I know the difference
between screwing up an investigation

420
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,450
and just screwing.

421
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,490
There's discreditable conduct and
there's just plain right and wrong.

422
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,610
Meaning? She was already under
threat for her little boy's life,

423
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,210
she was in protective custody.

424
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,410
If you've got a moral problem,
that's down to you.

425
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,170
There's nothing wrong
with MY morality!

426
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,410
I'm a single bloke and I've got
a normal private life.

427
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,570
With respect, sir, you need a better
reason for having this conversation.

428
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,650
How the hell are we supposed to
uphold standards

429
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,210
if you're running around town
not upholding them yourself?

430
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,820
That's my reason,
and it's a bloody good one.

431
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,940
I'm disappointed, son.

432
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,660
Go on, get out.

433
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,570
Another bollocking?
That's all I need.

434
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:46,130
No, I'll tell you
what you need. Come on.

435
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:50,410
So, this nurse, she fit, was she?

436
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,500
All right.

437
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,370
Well? Did you?

438
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,060
You need to brush up
your interrogation technique.

439
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,850
Don't look now, right...

440
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,730
What did I say about not looking?

441
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,850
There's a couple of birds
behind you.

442
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,780
Now, I'm not formulating a plan
or anything, but...

443
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,730
There's three of them.

444
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,450
I'm a bloody Detective Inspector,
I can see there's three of 'em.

445
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,770
There's always one who's got a
boyfriend, on her period or summat.

446
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,610
You were obviously off the day they
did gender awareness training.

447
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,300
Hey. I GAVE the gender
awareness training.

448
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,170
This is bloody weird, Dot.

449
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,050
What, me and you working together?
Well, yeah.

450
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:38,450
Well, that's Anti-Corruption, mate.
Beggars can't be choosers.

451
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,690
And this is all on me, by the way.
No, honestly.

452
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,330
We'll have no arguments.
First things first.

453
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,780
All right, captain.

454
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,530
Pop over there, yeah?

455
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,930
Ask those lovely ladies what
we can get them to drink.

456
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,060
No food, mind,
I'm not made of money.

457
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,370
Bent bitch! Bent bitch! Bent bitch!

458
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,490
Bent bitch! Bent bitch! Bent bitch!

459
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,580
Bent bitch!

460
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,180
Can you see it?

461
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,290
Hi.
You all right?

462
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,690
Yeah.

463
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,690
So there's a body?

464
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,130
We're taking it from here.
Sir?

465
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,730
Our crime scene.
You're joking.

466
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,690
It's our side of the investigation.

467
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,850
That floor was collapsing

468
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,210
because there's something underneath
it collapsing.

469
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,770
It's thanks to Kate the subsidence
was even noticed.
Well, top marks for that.

470
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,650
Sir, may I respectfully request any
findings be shared?

471
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,490
Send your request to my office
in writing.

472
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:56,010
Somebody will get back to you within
the next ten working days, OK?

473
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,970
Yes, please, ladies and gentlemen.
It's OK. I've got it.

474
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,060
Here it comes.

475
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,100
Call me later for initial forensics.

476
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,290
I've got it.

477
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,860
Let's go.

478
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,730
We're not making any announcement
about the body.

479
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,890
'You sure, sir?'

480
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:22,010
No. Not until we know how it fits
in with the overall investigation.

481
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,530
Sorry, Andrew, I've got
another call incoming.

482
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,570
'OK, boss.' We'll catch up
in the morning.

483
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,620
OK. Love to Liz and the kids. Bye.

484
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,130
Mike Dryden.
'Sorry, sir, it's Jo Rise.'

485
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,210
New Jo, hi.

486
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,370
'I'm afraid the Evening Herald
is going to run

487
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,020
'the speeding ticket story.'

488
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:46,010
I need to question you further in
regards to the industrial estate.

489
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,690
What were you really doing there?

490
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,850
I was investigating the
disappearance of Carly Kirk.

491
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,450
As I've already stated.

492
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,330
Ever been there before?

493
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,740
Consorted with individuals
connected with the place? No.

494
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,930
A body's been found buried under
the floor

495
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:06,250
of the old A&B Carriage Repairs
industrial unit.

496
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,940
Been there about two months.

497
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,690
And your presence was what,
a coincidence?

498
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,570
I was investigating the
disappearance...

499
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,530
The men who carried out the ambush
were the same men who used the nurse

500
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,970
to gain access to the hospital.

501
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,490
Same target, same clothing,
motorcycle gear.

502
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,530
They took the nurse to that garage,

503
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,450
the same place where the
girl's body was buried.

504
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,100
And you went there, too.

505
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:35,610
Now, if this was your case, would you
write those off as coincidences?

506
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,140
No. No. So, one way or another,
you're involved.

507
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,140
No.

508
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:45,780
The evidence is out there.
We will find it.

509
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,260
A girl. What age?

510
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,410
About 15.

511
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,290
Carly Kirk?

512
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,180
No ID yet, only initial forensics.
Why not?

513
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,970
Her face and finger pulps were
burnt off

514
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:06,250
using a high-temperature flame,
most likely a blowtorch.

515
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:10,010
Her teeth were removed, postmortem,
most likely with pliers,

516
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,540
preventing comparison of dental
records.

517
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,410
Cause of death?

518
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,530
Strangulation using some
kind of ligature.

519
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,250
Can her DNA be compared to Carly's?

520
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,010
There were control samples obtained
from her personal effects

521
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:29,170
when she disappeared.
They haven't been traced as yet.

522
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,340
They're lost?

523
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,740
It's just an admin glitch.

524
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,290
She was a nobody when she was alive.

525
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,620
And dead, she's still one.

526
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,140
Why are you so convinced it's her?

527
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,210
Because of a lead I was following.

528
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,730
The same lead that you think makes
out that I had to be in on it.

529
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,410
I was only searching for Carly.

530
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:58,580
Why? Of all the long-term mispers,
why her?

531
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,340
She was... She was only recently
disappeared.

532
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,420
There were leads.

533
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,780
I thought we'd find her.

534
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,180
I thought maybe there'd be some good
news for once in this job.

535
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,260
Ma'am, what's wrong?

536
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,730
Look.

537
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,580
It's tough in here, on anyone.

538
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,650
They told me about what happened to
your food.

539
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,170
Maybe you could make sure that you

540
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,020
only eat stuff out of a sealed
wrapper.

541
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:48,650
They said that you requested
a piano keyboard.

542
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,570
I'm sure that's something
we could look at.

543
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,570
If you can co-operate with our
investigation,

544
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,370
tell us things that we don't
already know,

545
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,690
there's all sorts we can do to
improve your situation.

546
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,210
I know why I'm in here.

547
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,450
Because I picked up a phone.

548
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,370
Because an officer in danger,
somebody I'd never even met before,

549
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,730
requested my help and I did what any
decent police officer would do.

550
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,490
Yeah, you did pick up a phone.
In a call box.

551
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,570
To speak to the nurse who was looking
after the target of the ambush.

552
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,770
And lied through your teeth
about it ever since.

553
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,300
That's the reason you're in here.

554
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,180
I shouldn't have lied.

555
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,220
I realised how incriminating it
sounded.

556
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,370
That I'd called the nurse.

557
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,820
So you're admitting it?

558
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,050
Yeah.

559
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,250
Yeah. So what is your connection
with the nurse?

560
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,340
None.

561
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:46,610
It didn't take a genius to work out
where the witness was being treated.

562
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,930
I made calls, always from phone
boxes.

563
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,810
Pretended I was from a recruitment
agency

564
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,730
asking for the names of nurses who
worked on the intensive care unit.

565
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,010
Why?

566
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,220
Because he had to know who was in on
it, who was after him.

567
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,650
I wanted to know if he'd spoken,

568
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,140
if he'd said anything that could
prove my innocence.

569
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,010
Is that the best you can
come up with?

570
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,450
It's the truth!
Well, it sounds...

571
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:14,010
What? Pathetic? Desperate?
Yeah.

572
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:17,130
I wasn't even supposed to
be on duty that night.

573
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,450
I was covering.

574
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,050
I did that a lot, for the inspectors
with families.

575
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,090
It was my way of trying to
get on, I suppose.

576
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,300
Pathetic. Desperate.

577
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,410
I need you to amend your statement,
ma'am, to go on record

578
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:36,970
with what you've just admitted
regarding the phone call.

579
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,380
I'm happy to.

580
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,140
Just as soon as you do the same.

581
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,730
Does the Deputy Chief Constable have
a statement to make regarding

582
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,610
the allegation about his speeding
offence in the Evening Herald?

583
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,250
The subject of this briefing is
the ongoing investigation

584
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,130
into the ambush in which three
police officers lost their lives.

585
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,850
Are you still the best
man for the job?

586
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,180
I will give a brief statement.

587
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,490
My wife and I strenuously
deny the allegation.

588
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:09,090
The fact that...in the midst
of what is clearly a complex

589
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,850
and controversial investigation,

590
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:15,090
the Herald chooses to trot out this
inaccurate slur... Will you resign?

591
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:18,300
Is your position untenable?

592
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,530
Is your position untenable?

593
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,940
Have you still got the
chief constable's backing?

594
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,060
Makes a change from
a minging subway.

595
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,890
You all right?

596
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,690
Get you a drink?

597
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,460
No, I better not have any more.

598
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,820
Have mine.

599
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,260
What's wrong?

600
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,660
Rich Akers is hiding something.

601
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,980
On the night of the ambush,
he called me.

602
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,540
What'd he call you about?

603
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,170
A message from Jayne.

604
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,930
She needed to speak to me.

605
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,500
About moving the witness?

606
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,100
Why'd you hide it?

607
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,660
Rich and I were involved
behind Jayne's back.

608
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,260
I didn't want it coming out.

609
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,660
Who else you told?

610
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,770
No-one.

611
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,210
Keep it that way.

612
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,490
You draw a line around it

613
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,770
and you walk away from it
like it never happened.

614
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,330
Steve... This'd be your career.

615
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,380
You see a life for yourself
outside the job?

616
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,140
No.

617
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,100
Richard Akers -
he won't blab about this?

618
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,490
He hasn't so far.

619
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,170
Good.

620
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,690
Down that, I'll get you home.

621
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,420
Lindsay Denton knows.

622
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,620
That's what all that business
was with your phone.

623
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,100
She went through my call history,
using it as leverage.

624
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,450
Your version of events is -
Richard Akers called you

625
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,170
because he was
worried about his wife.

626
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,690
It didn't materially affect
the investigation. End of.

627
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,380
Steve, that's a lie.

628
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,290
Maybe there are some people out
there who always tell the truth

629
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,450
and ones who always lie.

630
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,450
The rest of us choose our moments.

631
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,620
This is one of them.

632
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,900
The allegation about me
and my wife won't go away.

633
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,330
If you've thrown back a denial,

634
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,650
often there's a delay while
they get corroboration.

635
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,930
Screw them.

636
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,700
I've got a bigger story for you.

637
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,370
The person charged in connection
with the ambush,

638
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,130
the 36-year-old woman -

639
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,530
she's a police officer.

640
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:24,090
Detective Inspector Lindsay Denton
from the Missing Persons Unit

641
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,620
at 4th Street Station.

642
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,820
She led the convoy into the ambush...

643
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,300
..and conspired in the
witness's murder at the hospital.

644
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,730
'Is it correct that
Detective Inspector Lindsay Denton

645
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,340
'has been charged with
conspiracy to murder?

646
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,010
'I'm not going to be drawn into
elaborating on press speculation.'

647
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:50,460
God help me, when I find the leak,
I'm going to bury the bastard.

648
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,780
How'd they get this?

649
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,850
Have you understood
the safety briefing? Yeah.

650
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,050
You must complete
two sessions per week

651
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,170
of no less than 15 minutes each

652
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,770
and no more than 30 minutes each.

653
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,650
Answering "Yes" or "No" only,
do you understand?

654
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,340
Which machines can I use?

655
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,340
Yes.

656
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,220
Help me!

657
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,380
No!

658
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,220
N..! No!

659
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,260
No!

660
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,330
Bloody hell, Jen, quick!

661
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,900
You two, get away from her!

662
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,260
Have a seat.

663
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,490
Look, if anyone finds out,

664
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,290
we're for the high jump.

665
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,890
We'll sort out those two back there

666
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,730
and we can keep this
between ourselves?

667
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,850
Yeah, sure.

668
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,970
Cheers. You're a life-saver.

669
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,060
Fancy a cuppa?

670
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,770
Yeah, that'd be
really nice, thanks.

671
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:00,010
Jen, can you do the paperwork
and I'll do the brew?

672
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,250
No problem, Al. Lindsay...

673
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,530
Is it OK if I call you Lindsay?

674
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,970
Yeah, sure. Lindsay, could you
pop your hands on the table

675
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,010
next to this diagram
so I can have a look at them?

676
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,370
Milk, sugar?

677
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,180
Yeah. Milk, no sugar, please.

678
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:16,370
You've got a cracked nail.

679
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,900
Could've been worse, I suppose.
Thank God it wasn't!

680
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:24,130
You've been talking to AC-12.

681
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:27,850
From now on, you keep your gob shut.

682
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,340
Sir...

683
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,620
Thank you, Ted, but there's no need.
Hat off, at ease.

684
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,980
Sir.

685
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,020
I've considered the pros and cons
with no little deliberation.

686
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,620
You're in a vulnerable position.

687
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,930
An anti-corruption officer is more
likely than most to encounter

688
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,650
situations that place him
susceptible to bribery.

689
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,060
Sir.

690
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,890
However, coming to me as you did...

691
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,540
is a mark of your character.

692
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,290
This is...

693
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:11,130
possibly the most morally
complex investigation

694
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,580
this force has ever carried out.

695
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:18,570
I, for one, would feel
less confident of success

696
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:21,340
without your guiding hand
on the tiller.

697
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,860
I'd like you to carry on.

698
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:28,340
I don't know what to say, sir.

699
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,730
I haven't discussed
this with anyone.

700
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,580
I think the fewer people know
about your situation, the better.

701
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,690
Very grateful, sir. Thank you, sir.

702
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,170
Is there anything I can do to help?

703
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,340
No, no, sir, no.

704
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,930
The wife and I are
back on track, sir.

705
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,300
Good man, glad to hear it.

706
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,980
Charged anyone else while
our backs have been turned?

707
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,770
Very interesting question, sir.

708
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,530
Should I have?

709
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,860
Must be great up
there on that pedestal...

710
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:08,380
..all holier-than-thou.

711
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,980
All the further to fall, mind...

712
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,650
..when the truth comes out.

713
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,420
Les. Sir.

714
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,810
All right, boss. All right.

715
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,210
What you having?

716
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:49,300
Oh, it's my shout.

717
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,620
Pint of Kronenbourg. Ta.

718
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:58,090
I imagine I'm keeping you
from your busy social life.

719
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,580
Could do with a night off.

720
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,940
You seeing that nurse again?

721
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,530
Sir, you and I see certain
things differently.

722
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,620
That doesn't mean
there isn't respect.

723
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,540
Except for my personal views.

724
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,420
Some.

725
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,060
We were married at 18.

726
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,900
She was the only one.

727
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,290
And we waited.

728
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:28,900
Is that what you don't respect?

729
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,370
I spoke to you, sir,
in the wrong manner.

730
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:43,210
I apologise.

731
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,930
I'd be grateful if you could see
your way to putting it behind us.

732
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,300
You would, would you?

733
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:51,250
Well, I guess it'd be rude not to.

734
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,540
Don't want to be rude.

735
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,540
I disappointed you, sir.

736
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,460
Sometimes I disappoint myself.

737
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,740
Welcome to the club.

738
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,180
Are you in much pain?

739
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,580
Yes.

740
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:03,580
What've they said about your hands?

741
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:08,170
The medical officer doesn't know
how bad they'll be.

742
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,140
He's referred me to a specialist.

743
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,460
I'm sorry.

744
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:16,210
I heard there was a problem
with the CCTV recording.

745
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,500
Conveniently.

746
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:22,370
DI Denton, I'd like to take
a statement from you today

747
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,010
to be included in evidence,

748
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:28,130
regarding your amendments to earlier
statements given in evidence.

749
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:30,370
We had an agreement about that.

750
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,810
Are you aware the prosecution's

751
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,890
made a Public Interest Immunity
application?

752
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:36,170
It was brought up
at my bail hearing.

753
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:38,490
Well, it's been accepted.

754
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:42,050
They've got non-disclosure
of sensitive evidence.

755
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:45,290
Included in said sensitive evidence

756
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,460
is my call history.

757
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,330
They can't do that.

758
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:52,970
I was an undercover officer
gathering evidence against you.

759
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:56,090
Disclosure of my communications
history could jeopardise

760
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:59,650
undercover contacts and future ops.
That's just not true!

761
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:00,970
It's a cover-up!

762
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:04,810
Our legal team did their job.
I'm just here to do mine. Now...

763
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,570
in regards to the
phone call you made...

764
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:08,820
What, so your phone call
from Akers gets vanished?

765
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:13,290
Like the CCTV of me being
attacked by two inmates,

766
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:15,650
like those same
two inmates testifying

767
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,330
that I burned my own hands

768
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:19,530
and that the prison officers
tried to stop me?

769
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:23,410
It suits everyone for me
to be silenced.

770
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,810
I'm taking your statement, aren't I?

771
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:27,250
Look, this attack -

772
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,050
it's opened my eyes.

773
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:32,290
I was set up to get involved
in the transfer of the witness.

774
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:34,890
The newspaper leak about me,
the attack,

775
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:37,090
and now the
non-disclosure of evidence -

776
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,570
it all makes sense,
even the screws are involved.

777
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:42,050
They said as much. They said what?

778
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,330
They said not to talk to you.

779
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,900
What, what we're doing now?

780
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:47,730
No-one appears to be stopping us.

781
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,130
No, but...

782
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:52,210
Look, you've been badly
shaken by the attack.

783
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,810
Maybe it's best I come
when you're feeling better.

784
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:56,130
No, wait.

785
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:58,010
Listen to me.

786
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:00,490
Don't you see how I've been set up?

787
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,250
Even down to the fact that AC-12

788
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,810
were prevented from looking
at witness protection.

789
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,660
All you could do was focus on me.

790
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:11,460
Now, only somebody at executive
level has that kind of power.

791
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:15,540
And the only person I told about
the operation was Mike Dryden.

792
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:22,980
You've lied through your teeth
throughout this investigation...

793
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,690
..and now you're
using an exec officer

794
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,490
as a way of tying us in knots.

795
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,380
No, that's not what is it! Really?

796
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:35,490
I know Mike Dryden.

797
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:36,580
You "know" him?

798
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,090
We had an affair.

799
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,180
Five years.

800
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:43,460
And?

801
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,580
And?

802
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,820
He didn't leave his wife, did he?

803
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,250
You gave him an ultimatum

804
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,860
and then it was all over.

805
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,130
You and I both know that
you don't have the right

806
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,020
to act superior over
our private lives.

807
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:12,090
Why are you only
telling us this now?

808
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,930
Because I don't know
myself if it's true!

809
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,370
Why would he do that to me?

810
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:16,570
I've done nothing to him.

811
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,210
If anything, I've protected him.

812
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:20,810
No, you're a woman scorned.

813
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,970
Not only do you get
your revenge on him,

814
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:26,170
but you use him as a way of
screwing up our investigation.

815
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,930
Do you believe that I'm guilty?

816
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:31,970
I just gather the evidence.
The courts decides. I get it.

817
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,250
I get it.

818
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,850
It's your way of
dealing with the fact

819
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:37,060
that you might be putting away
an innocent person.

820
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,580
I think you're guilty.

821
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:03,900
Bent bitch! Bent bitch!

822
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:04,850
DC Fleming.

823
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:08,450
'Jan Evans. You left a message
regarding the 4th Street duty logs.'

824
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,330
Yeah. Thanks for getting back to me.

825
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:13,210
I'm seeking information regarding
the rota for duty inspector

826
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,780
at 4th Street Station on
the night of September 5th.

827
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:17,970
'You mean...'

828
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:19,730
Yeah, the night of the ambush.

829
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:22,380
'I have that information on file.
Please hold.'

830
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:27,290
Dot's up to something.

831
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,770
One minute.

832
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:30,610
'DI Denton covered the ghost rota

833
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:33,100
'as Inspector Barlow was
reassigned that night.'

834
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,730
Who was responsible
for that change?

835
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,300
'Hold one second.'

836
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:44,450
'Inspector Barlow received
an invitation to attend

837
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,290
'a session of the Crime Executive.

838
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:49,860
'It came directly from Deputy
Chief Constable Dryden's office.'

839
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:52,980
Great, thank you.

840
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:03,900
What's going on?

841
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:09,970
Well?

842
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:12,450
We've got the financial
forensics back in.

843
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,690
Looks like Jayne Akers

844
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:16,010
was on the receiving end
of a substantial payment.

845
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,050
How substantial?

846
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,500
Upwards of 50 grand.

847
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:24,530
We need to include Kate.

848
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:26,130
Akers was her mate.

849
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,690
And Kate's my partner.

850
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:28,820
Steve!

851
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:42,450
Under Rule 46, vulnerable persons
must shower alone.

852
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,130
From the dispensers on the wall,

853
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,890
you're permitted one measure of soap

854
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:47,770
and one measure of shampoo.

855
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:50,370
You must shower in no
longer than six minutes.

856
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:53,500
Answering only "Yes" or "No",
do you understand?

857
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,620
What is it?

858
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:04,170
Lindsay alleged she was set up
by another police officer.

859
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,530
I've gone back through her file

860
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:08,530
and she served with this officer for
nearly a year back when she was a DS,

861
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:10,010
working in crime audit.

862
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,170
He was a chief superintendent.

863
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:14,530
I've just taken a call from
one of the administrators

864
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:16,100
at 4th Street Station and...

865
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,810
..on the night of the ambush,

866
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:26,010
this particular officer
caused the rota to be changed,

867
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:28,410
the change that put
Lindsay Denton on duty that night.

868
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:29,730
He was a chief super?

869
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:31,250
What is he now?

870
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,700
Deputy chief constable.

871
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:35,770
It's Mike Dryden.

872
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:38,810
Oh, Jesus bloody Christ. Dot...

873
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:40,170
Yeah, I need a breather.

874
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:43,060
One wrong move and we could
all be directing traffic.

875
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:47,980
Well? Steve?

876
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:50,810
All right.

877
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:53,260
But first I need to talk
to you about Jayne Akers.

878
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,970
'How are you?
You do not have to say anything.

879
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:12,010
'Tickety-boo.

880
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,930
'You sit there and you try and twist
some case out of my misfortunes.'

881
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:17,170
'Status Zero! Status Zero!'

882
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,970
'Three of our colleagues have lost
their lives in the line of duty.

883
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:22,130
'All I did was do my job.
It was no accident, was it?

884
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:24,170
'Three of our own in the
morgue because of you.

885
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,410
'No firearms? No backup!

886
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:28,170
'The officer plunged five floors
and is reported to have died.

887
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:30,170
'Denton, I am arresting
you for conspiracy...

888
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,970
'Take away the one
good thing in my life.

889
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:35,540
'I think you're guilty.'

890
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:45,860
No.

891
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:15,900
I'm delighted that significant
progress is being made.

892
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:19,010
The net is closing in.

893
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:57,780
I believe you.

894
00:57:58,305 --> 00:58:58,522

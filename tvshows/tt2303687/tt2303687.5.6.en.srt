1
00:00:04,967 --> 00:00:06,806
It's called Operation Pear Tree.

2
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:09,246
Our brief was to embed
an undercover officer

3
00:00:09,247 --> 00:00:11,166
within an organised crime group.

4
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:13,367
Detective Sergeant John Corbett.

5
00:00:16,268 --> 00:00:18,347
I'm just trying to get to the truth.

6
00:00:18,348 --> 00:00:20,787
The top brass,
they don't want me to succeed.

7
00:00:20,788 --> 00:00:24,300
There's a bent copper running
organised crime, I'm sure of it.

8
00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:29,267
The man that broke in,
I never saw his face.

9
00:00:29,268 --> 00:00:31,467
He said you'd know why he'd done it.

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,529
I assaulted your gaffer's wife.

11
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,867
He'll make sure I go down,
there's no two ways about it.

12
00:00:35,868 --> 00:00:39,027
One zero to four five.
The order is Fahrenheit.

13
00:00:39,028 --> 00:00:40,827
Sir, we'll lose all of Corbett's intel.

14
00:00:40,828 --> 00:00:43,460
We know that Corbett
is a coldblooded killer.

15
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,867
Give yourself up!

16
00:00:46,868 --> 00:00:49,980
You shoot me, then the truth
never comes out.

17
00:00:52,388 --> 00:00:53,800
Lee Banks?

18
00:00:53,825 --> 00:00:56,238
- Who the hell are you?
- Superintendent Hastings.

19
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,787
You're a rat, John.

20
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,667
A rat.

21
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,127
What if he did blow Corbett's cover?

22
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,108
Doesn't bear thinking about.

23
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:08,378
- This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
- How much?

24
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:09,467
£100,000.

25
00:01:09,468 --> 00:01:11,547
Haven't we earned a payday?

26
00:01:11,548 --> 00:01:15,027
I don't want the fiasco of Operation
Pear Tree, which was not of your

27
00:01:15,028 --> 00:01:19,108
making, add a disastrous coda to
an otherwise distinguished career.

28
00:01:24,188 --> 00:01:26,467
Cover it up with all this stuff. Come on.

29
00:01:26,468 --> 00:01:28,667
I never asked you how your exams went.

30
00:01:28,668 --> 00:01:30,708
Yeah, I got a date for my interview.

31
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:34,867
It's clear to me that the threshold
test has been passed

32
00:01:34,868 --> 00:01:37,787
and therefore it is my lawful right
to arrest you on suspicion

33
00:01:37,788 --> 00:01:40,820
- of conspiracy to murder John Corbett.
- No, no, no.

34
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,316
You will be held in custody

35
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:45,187
while we gather further
evidence against you.

36
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,980
What is happening here?
I am being framed!

37
00:01:50,268 --> 00:01:51,747
Today was just for starters.

38
00:01:51,748 --> 00:01:54,180
Now I'm going to prove
that Hastings is H.

39
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,267
The inquiry into Superintendent Hastings

40
00:02:03,268 --> 00:02:06,267
is not a matter over which
you're entitled to exercise choice.

41
00:02:06,268 --> 00:02:08,787
Cooperation is your lawful duty
as police officers

42
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:12,187
and failure to comply is an offence
under police conduct regulations.

43
00:02:12,188 --> 00:02:15,580
Any of you obstructing my officers
can and will face arrest.

44
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,467
But let's not fall out over this.

45
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,988
I'm sure we can all work together nicely.

46
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,580
DI Fleming, DS Arnott,
can I borrow you a minute?

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

48
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,270
Seven years and counting.

49
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:37,787
No-one's worked more closely
with Ted Hastings than you two.

50
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,187
You have better insights into
the man than anyone else in AC12.

51
00:02:41,188 --> 00:02:46,220
So, what you know, I need to know,
my team needs to know.

52
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,467
Ma'am, I'm not comfortable
kicking the gaffer when he's down.

53
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,270
He recruited you.

54
00:02:55,295 --> 00:02:56,530
- Yes, ma'am.
- Mm-hm.

55
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,147
Stuck by you when perhaps
some others wouldn't have.

56
00:03:00,148 --> 00:03:03,780
Shagging witnesses and suspects
and the like.

57
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,187
I sympathise with your loyalties,
DS Arnott, I really do,

58
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,467
but on the other hand we have found
£50,000 stashed in his hotel room

59
00:03:11,468 --> 00:03:14,471
so if I were you I wouldn't go round
professing too close a loyalty

60
00:03:14,472 --> 00:03:17,567
to Ted Hastings, otherwise people
might just start suspecting you

61
00:03:17,568 --> 00:03:19,780
of being an accessory to his offences.

62
00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:23,467
H.

63
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,187
A senior police officer
sitting at the top

64
00:03:26,188 --> 00:03:28,747
of an institutionalised relationship

65
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,980
between organised crime
and corrupt police officers.

66
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,880
AC12 failed to bring him down.

67
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,160
I won't.

68
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,520
Wow.

69
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,719
£50,000.

70
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,999
Ma'am, Sarge, can we talk please?

71
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,193
- Sure. What's up?

72
00:03:59,218 --> 00:04:00,479
- I've been looking into
John Corbett's past,

73
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,679
like you asked me to. You said
it was completely confidential

74
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,200
- and I couldn't share it with anyone.
- What have you found?

75
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,199
- May I ask what's going on in here?
- Yeah. A private conversation.

76
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,919
Didn't you hear DCS Carmichael?
We need to know everything.

77
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,200
- It's Michelle, isn't it?
- Yes.

78
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,679
Listen, Michelle, we're AC12.

79
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,519
We do this to other units
week-in-week-out

80
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,119
so don't try telling me how it works.

81
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,999
We're witnesses, not suspects.

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,680
Now, stop making a tit of yourself
and piss off.

83
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,599
Sorry. Go on.

84
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,679
It goes back to
Superintendent Hastings' service

85
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,679
with the Royal Ulster Constabulary.

86
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,522
When he was a PC in the 1980s,
he was interviewed in connection

87
00:04:42,523 --> 00:04:45,060
with the disappearance
of Anne-Marie McGillis.

88
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,679
- Corbett's mum?
- Yeah.

89
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,997
- The records aren't brilliant.
- No, they never were in them days.

90
00:04:50,998 --> 00:04:53,679
But they've been retained as
the disappearance remains unsolved.

91
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,797
You've got this on file?

92
00:04:54,822 --> 00:04:57,319
Yes, Sarge,
but I've kept it security protected.

93
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,712
Well done, but I don't want you
getting in trouble

94
00:04:59,713 --> 00:05:03,399
so you should share the file
with DCS Carmichael's team.

95
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,919
Yes, ma'am.

96
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,520
Thank you, ma'am.

97
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,679
Christ's sake, Kate.

98
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,470
I'm just calling it as I see it,
Steve. The truth comes first.

99
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:16,879
What, we just help Carmichael
hammer nails in the gaffer's coffin?

100
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,359
Well, you heard Carmichael.
If the gaffer is found guilty,

101
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,439
I can guarantee it'll be us
she'll be after next.

102
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,319
"Oh, we must have
known Hastings was bent."

103
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,719
What if the gaffer's innocent?
We'll have betrayed him.

104
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,759
He'll come after us and we'll deserve it.

105
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,679
Well, I don't know about you, Steve,
but I'm not going to sit around

106
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,473
and wait for a kicking off
the gaffer or Carmichael

107
00:05:33,474 --> 00:05:35,100
when there's police work to be done.

108
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:45,120
Stand clear of the door.

109
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,599
Corbett's murder, Hastings' arrest.

110
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,159
Fortunately, it will all be
covered by our application

111
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,919
for Public Interest Immunity.

112
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,919
Nothing need ever come out.

113
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,479
Unless Carmichael proves
a link between Hastings

114
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,919
and organised crime.
We have to go public with that.

115
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,300
There's pros and cons PR-wise.

116
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,359
Which makes me think we need to
emphasise the wording.

117
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,919
Wording?

118
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,399
Operation Pear Tree's objective
was to examine institutionalised

119
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,679
links between corrupt police
officers and organised criminals.

120
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,679
Most people would prefer us spending
that money reducing response times,

121
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,000
putting more bobbies on the beat.

122
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,999
- Anyway, I'll leave that with you.
- Where are you going?

123
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,319
The inquiry into Superintendent Hastings

124
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,900
must be above reproach.

125
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,840
Wouldn't hurt to make sure.

126
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,720
- This is never easy.
- No.

127
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,679
Sorry for your loss.

128
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,679
We're sorry to have to ask

129
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,159
but we're making further enquiries
into John's undercover operation.

130
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,919
I can't help you.

131
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,420
Not sure I would even if I could.

132
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,000
I met John a few times.

133
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,920
He was a very brave man.

134
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,679
Steph, from what Merseyside Police
have told us

135
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,600
about your reaction to the news
of your husband's death...

136
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,122
...it has made us question some
of the things you said to us

137
00:07:59,123 --> 00:08:00,540
when we was last here.

138
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,080
You're not in any trouble.

139
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,440
We just want to do right by John.

140
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,639
Sit down if you like.

141
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,320
Thank you.

142
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,680
It was all an act before.

143
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,100
John told me that was how to play it
to protect him.

144
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,679
Going back to our visit
on the 10th of March,

145
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,380
we asked you about John's links
to Northern Ireland.

146
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,680
He grew up over there.

147
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,399
When his mum died,
he was took in by his auntie.

148
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,399
Did John ever talk about his mum?

149
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,760
Yeah.

150
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,679
We've got a name, Anne-Marie McGillis.

151
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,679
Anne-Marie, yeah.

152
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,920
What did John say about her?

153
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,999
John never said much.

154
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,679
To be honest, I don't know
how much he ever knew.

155
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,679
He was... He was only a kid when it
all happened, about nine or ten.

156
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,520
When what happened?

157
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,159
The story was Anne-Marie
was helping the police

158
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,600
and then the police betrayed her.

159
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,360
Let on she was an informant
and that's why she got killed.

160
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,360
Did John ever say there was
a particular officer involved?

161
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,399
When he was older,
his auntie said there was one

162
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,479
that Anne-Marie had talked about.

163
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,680
A young fella her age.

164
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,280
I think he took a shine to her and
she trusted him to look out for her.

165
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,680
He should have but he didn't.

166
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:48,653
Or worse.

167
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,560
What do you mean, worse?

168
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,679
Something John said.

169
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,159
This copper, he was married,
and there was a bit of scandal

170
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,759
about him spending so much time
round Anne-Marie's.

171
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,679
Maybe it suited him
for Anne-Marie to go missing.

172
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,320
Did John have any evidence of this?

173
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,319
Not that I know of.

174
00:10:10,606 --> 00:10:12,686
Was there a name for this officer?

175
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:15,659
If there was, I never heard it.

176
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,440
Not from John.

177
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,239
Did John ever connect this family
history to the undercover operation

178
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,679
he was involved in
at the time of his death?

179
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,000
John never told me what his jobs
was about for me own protection.

180
00:10:29,206 --> 00:10:30,886
And his.

181
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,040
Why are you so interested in what
happened in Northern Ireland?

182
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,999
Is there a connection?

183
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,680
We don't know.

184
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,919
Corbett never mentioned Hastings
to Steph.

185
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,839
He was only a kid when it happened.
Maybe he never knew the name.

186
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,839
Still, the undercover officer
recruited to investigate

187
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,424
links between the OCG
and corrupt officers,

188
00:10:57,425 --> 00:10:59,239
all the way up to H,
just happens to be the son

189
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,319
of a woman murdered on
the gaffer's patch?

190
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,479
Well, now we know why Corbett was
so convinced the gaffer's bent.

191
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,023
What we don't know is if someone
else knew about Corbett's past link

192
00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:09,401
to the gaffer or if somehow
Corbett managed to put himself

193
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,660
- forward for the job.
- Exactly.

194
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,959
Any chance of it being a coincidence?

195
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,420
Coincidence, my arse.

196
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,079
I see you've cleared everybody out.

197
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,159
That'll save the mutual
embarrassment when I'm reinstated.

198
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,239
DCS Carmichael had concerns
about security.

199
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,320
AC12 had a corrupt DI
who shot his way out of here.

200
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,920
- Did you manage to get any sleep?
- Not much.

201
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,160
Thank you. As you were.

202
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,399
Listen, this heavy mob that
you've just parachuted in,

203
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,479
they look a bit trigger-happy to me.

204
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,719
But our man, Police Sergeant
Kyle Ferringham,

205
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,599
he knows this building inside out,

206
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,679
you will not find a safer pair of hands.

207
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,919
You just said it. He's your man.

208
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,140
I'll stick with mine, thank you.

209
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,919
Second interview of Edward Hastings
in the presence of his solicitor

210
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,359
by DCS Carmichael, DI Brandyce
and PS Tranter.

211
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,919
You remain under caution.

212
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,119
As you know, you may be held for up
to 24 hours,

213
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,640
at which point you will
either be released

214
00:12:32,641 --> 00:12:36,040
or charged with conspiracy
to murder John Corbett.

215
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,759
Pausing interview.

216
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,060
PS Ferringham on official business.

217
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,159
What's going on?

218
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,399
Gill Biggeloe, Senior Legal Counsel
to the PCC, attending

219
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,759
as an official observer to ensure
correct procedures are followed.

220
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,399
- Why wasn't I informed?
- You just were.

221
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,000
Thank you.

222
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,920
Ma'am.

223
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,680
Hi, Ted.

224
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,159
Resuming interview, now with PCC's
Senior Legal Counsel observing.

225
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,995
- Mr Hastings, how did you...?
- I thought, ma'am,

226
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,240
that we had agreed that
I would be addressed by my rank.

227
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,679
Given the gravity of the charge
against you,

228
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,603
I know we'd both hate to be accused
of special treatment.

229
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,319
Best we treat you like
any normal, regular person

230
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,200
who's been accused of plotting
to kill someone, don't you agree?

231
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,239
When did you receive confirmation
that John Corbett

232
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,080
had assaulted your wife?

233
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,559
I'm sorry to probe. I know this must
be extremely upsetting for you.

234
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,679
- On the 12th of March.
- When on the 12th of March?

235
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,260
During the operation to apprehend him.

236
00:13:57,893 --> 00:13:59,213
Oh.

237
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,239
I see.

238
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,159
Talk about a pressure situation.
My heart goes out to you.

239
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,399
To have that trauma
at that very same moment

240
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,260
as being in command of armed
officers surrounding John Corbett.

241
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,919
Still, and, I am sorry about this,

242
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,679
I do need to ask you about
the events that followed.

243
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,079
DI Brandyce.

244
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,399
Document 53 in your folders.

245
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,919
Document 53 is a copy of the report

246
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,399
made by the Tactical Firearms Commander

247
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,039
during said operation
on the 12th of March,

248
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,030
written on the 13th of March

249
00:14:28,055 --> 00:14:31,679
and received later that day by
the Strategic Firearms Commander.

250
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,319
Drawing your attention to page three
of said report, paragraph four,

251
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:41,199
"Superintendent Hastings relayed
a Fahrenheit order to DS Arnott."

252
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,537
- Did you give said order?
- Yes.

253
00:14:43,538 --> 00:14:45,170
What's your understanding of said order?

254
00:14:45,171 --> 00:14:49,679
The authority to deploy lethal force
to prevent immediate loss of life

255
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,319
or prevent immediate danger
to the public.

256
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,479
Responsibility for issuing said order

257
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,679
lies with the Strategic
Firearms Commander.

258
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,119
For the order to be issued by
any other officer is unlawful.

259
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,679
Corbett had already drawn his firearm,

260
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,359
DS Arnott was facing
an immediate threat to life,

261
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,679
I was concerned that DS Arnott
would hesitate

262
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,649
and that Corbett would discharge
his firearm.

263
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,479
I gave the order to save
my officer's life.

264
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,300
In your mind, having just learned
that Corbett had tortured your wife,

265
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,199
- no other motivations were at work?
- None.

266
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,530
And that he was involved in
the death of one of your officers,

267
00:15:22,531 --> 00:15:24,159
- PC Maneet Bindra?
- Yes.

268
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,319
- You weren't vengeful towards Corbett?
- My first concern remained,

269
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,679
as it should do for all police
officers, the preservation of life.

270
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,879
Clearly you weren't concerned
with the preservation

271
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,959
- of John Corbett's life.
- I did not cause his death.

272
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,877
He brought it upon himself
when he went rogue.

273
00:15:36,878 --> 00:15:38,018
I take no pleasure in this

274
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:40,320
but the man
had it coming to him in spades.

275
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,159
I'd like to return to the remarks
you made to DS Railston

276
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,399
following the assault on your wife.

277
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,679
That's Document 60 in your folders.

278
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,559
Document 60 is a crime report
by DS Samantha Railston

279
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,279
detailing statements made by
Edward Hastings on the 8th of March.

280
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,879
Page 2, para 3,

281
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,560
"Superintendent Hastings stated,

282
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,639
'Whoever's responsible better
start praying

283
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,359
"'he's up in front of the judge
before I get my hands on him.'"

284
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,780
What did you mean by that?

285
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,279
It was rhetorical.

286
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,519
And what would you have done
if, as per your statement,

287
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,660
you had "got your hands on him"?

288
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,919
I would have done what any police
officer would have done

289
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,759
and arrested him for grievous
bodily harm.

290
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,239
Which sounds like what any
law-abiding officer would do.

291
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,799
Well, I am a law-abiding officer.

292
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,879
And yet, on the 12th of March,
you ordered DS Arnott

293
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,479
to shoot John Corbett in cold blood.

294
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,199
To prevent an immediate loss of life!

295
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,479
And later that same day,
you visited Lee Banks,

296
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,559
an OCG member on remand
in Blackthorn Prison.

297
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,959
Yeah, to harvest information on the OCG.

298
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,599
When DS Arnott quite rightly did not
deploy lethal force against

299
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,879
John Corbett, did you take matters
into your own hands

300
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,466
and disclose to Lee Banks

301
00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:45,519
that John Corbett was
an undercover police officer?

302
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,039
No, I did not.

303
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,839
Disclosing this information with
the expectation that it would be

304
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,460
- passed on to the OCG?
- No!

305
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,519
I'm really sorry to labour something that

306
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,719
I know you find very upsetting,
but I'd like to return

307
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,159
to the injuries that John Corbett
inflicted on your wife.

308
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,319
If you must.

309
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,700
Thank you.

310
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,759
The case was dealt with by
the Serious Crime Unit.

311
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,559
Document 60 in your folders.

312
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,719
Drawing your attention to page 2, para 2,

313
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,999
"When questioned, Superintendent
Hastings denied knowledge of

314
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,559
"any significance to the pattern of
injuries sustained by the victim."

315
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,236
- Is that what you said to DS Railston?
- Yes.

316
00:17:21,237 --> 00:17:23,679
Thank you for being truthful with us.

317
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,359
I can't tell you how much easier
that makes everything.

318
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,559
Now, as part of our inquiry,

319
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,479
we've been given access
to your service record.

320
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,079
The service record is summarised
in Document 2 in your folders.

321
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,559
The service record indicates

322
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,679
Edward Hastings joined the
Royal Ulster Constabulary in 1982

323
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,999
and served as a police constable
for seven years,

324
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,364
till his promotion to Police Sergeant

325
00:17:47,365 --> 00:17:49,439
and transfer in 1989.

326
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,479
Sorry, I don't mean to put you on
the spot, but seven years' policing

327
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,919
in Northern Ireland in the 1980s,
and you never came across

328
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,239
a pattern of injuries that involved
the wrists, knees and ankles?

329
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,359
Yeah, but, look...

330
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,639
You have to remember, my team
had only just discovered

331
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,919
that DS Railston's officer,

332
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,959
Commanding Detective Chief
Superintendent Lester Hargreaves,

333
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,799
was corrupt, having been an accomplice

334
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,679
with the OCG in their armed robbery
of Eastfield Depot.

335
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,079
So, you're offering by way of
an explanation

336
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,959
that you withheld information

337
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,799
for fear of how it would be
misused by Railston?

338
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,839
The assault on my wife
appeared to be the work

339
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,519
of the organised crime group
that we were investigating,

340
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,220
a threat or a warning to me
to suppress the inquiry.

341
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,759
I just didn't want to give them
the satisfaction

342
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,479
of knowing how upsetting
I found the whole event.

343
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,079
So, you did appreciate
the significance of the injuries?

344
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,759
Yes, all right, look, if you want
me to state the obvious.

345
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,519
Yes, a resemblance to punishment
and or torture meted out

346
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,479
by paramilitary and/or terrorist
organisations.

347
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,039
Indeed, so now, let's turn
to your service

348
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,119
with the Royal Ulster Constabulary
in the period 1982-1989, inclusive.

349
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,119
Document 62.

350
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,439
PC Edward Hastings served
in West Belfast.

351
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,999
A periodic professional assessment
submitted in the summer of 1988

352
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,879
by Police Sergeant Thomas Cranford
notes the following,

353
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,519
"Hastings appears to have a rapport
with the Catholic community

354
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,866
"due to his own Catholic tendencies."

355
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:14,959
Are you able to tell us a little bit
about your background?

356
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,879
Well, I'd really rather not.

357
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,559
A Catholic in the RUC,
were you in the minority?

358
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,359
I was, and am, a police officer.

359
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,879
I do not discriminate
against my fellow officers

360
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,119
on grounds of creed, and I would
appreciate the same courtesy.

361
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,439
Well, the sergeant writing up

362
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,879
that RUC periodic professional assessment

363
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,519
didn't mind referring to it.

364
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,288
Document 62 continued,

365
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:40,205
"Hastings' family background
is more complicated,

366
00:19:40,206 --> 00:19:42,719
"which may prove valuable
in future assignments."

367
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,267
What did he mean by that?

368
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:46,919
- You'd have to ask him.
- We did.

369
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,439
Document 65 in your folders.

370
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,679
Statement by former Police Sergeant,
now retired, Thomas Cranford,

371
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,039
submitted to Anticorruption Unit 3
on the 14th of March.

372
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,399
"We all thought he was Protestant.

373
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,439
"Edward and Hastings, what else
is the fella going to be?

374
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,159
"Turned out that was a sensitive subject.

375
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,999
"His old man was a Protestant
but he'd married a Catholic,

376
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,839
"and when he went off, his mum
brought up young Ted that way."

377
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,399
Why did you leave the RUC?

378
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,500
Well...

379
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,020
...the kind of talk we just heard
being quoted didn't help.

380
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,199
In 1989, you suffered serious injuries.

381
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,199
On 29th of June 1989,

382
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,399
an RUC patrol vehicle drove over
a pipe bomb, causing the death

383
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,159
of PC Patrick O'Malley and serious
injury to PC Edward Hastings.

384
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,679
Two Catholic officers targeted?

385
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,039
Yeah, well, it doesn't take a genius
to see why I put in for a transfer.

386
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,120
Or were you targeted for another reason?

387
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,559
I don't know what you're referring to.

388
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,519
I'd like to examine events
in the period 1988-1989

389
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,919
and, specifically, a special
assignment that you took part in.

390
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,759
Do you recognise the name
Anne-Marie McGillis?

391
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,119
For the DIR, I'm showing
the interviewee Image 41,

392
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,420
an RUC file photograph of
Anne-Marie McGillis.

393
00:21:05,146 --> 00:21:06,380
Mr Hastings?

394
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,800
You're going back 30 years here, come on.

395
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,999
Let's see if this can jog your memory.

396
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,639
Document 78 in your folders.

397
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,279
Document 78 is a report entered into
the Royal Ulster Constabulary files

398
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,079
on missing persons,
dated the 23rd of May 1989.

399
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,359
Anne-Marie McGillis was reported
missing on the 19th April 1989.

400
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,959
The night before, Tuesday the 18th April,

401
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,437
Anne-Marie left her son with a neighbour,

402
00:21:36,438 --> 00:21:39,399
informing the neighbour that she was
popping out for a couple of hours

403
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,879
to visit a friend in hospital.

404
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,759
Anne-Marie never returned
to collect her son.

405
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,599
No witnesses came forward
to reveal Anne-Marie's movements

406
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,039
on the night she disappeared.

407
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,879
No-one known to Anne-Marie was able
to identify the family friend

408
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,679
who was admitted in to hospital.

409
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,719
The Missing Persons team concluded
that this person didn't exist,

410
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,959
and that Anne-Marie had deceived
her neighbour

411
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,639
regarding her activities
on the night she disappeared.

412
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,319
A number of individuals known to
Anne-Marie were interviewed

413
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,479
in connection with
the Missing Persons inquiry.

414
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,199
And one such individual was
Police Constable Edward Hastings.

415
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,759
Do you recall these events, Mr Hastings?

416
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,799
Some.

417
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,080
What do you recall?

418
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,759
Well, Anne-Marie's husband had been
murdered a few years before.

419
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,479
Apparently, he was active
during the Troubles.

420
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,599
One of those nasty little
tit-for-tat killings.

421
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,759
Anyway, Anne-Marie,

422
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,679
she blamed someone higher up
the chain of command

423
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,300
for her husband's death, you know...

424
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,759
She felt that he was sacrificed
needlessly.

425
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,540
Anyway, grief, I think...

426
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,199
...later turned to passing
information to the police

427
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,439
about terrorist activities.

428
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,693
- She was an CHIS informant?
- Yes.

429
00:22:48,694 --> 00:22:51,439
And did you play a role in
Anne-Marie serving as a CHIS?

430
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,919
Yes, well, she...
Look, she lived on my patch.

431
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,519
You know, in those days,

432
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,280
it was very difficult for the RUC
to enter certain areas, to er...

433
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,119
...to put it mildly.

434
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,959
And I think some local women
found out my mother was a Catholic

435
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,559
and that I was a Catholic too.

436
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,519
And I think that bought a bit of trust.

437
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,799
You were instrumental in Anne-Marie
trusting the police

438
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,639
with information she was disclosing
about terrorist organisations?

439
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,199
I helped, that's all.

440
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,280
Did you have meetings with Mrs McGillis?

441
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,393
- Some.
- According to the file,

442
00:23:19,394 --> 00:23:21,639
you didn't always meet Anne-Marie
in covert locations.

443
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,639
You were seen entering
and leaving her home.

444
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,079
Yes, you know, I'd give her a hand.

445
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,480
Little odd jobs,
there was no man about the house.

446
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,479
I'm no expert in RUC covert tactics
in the 1980s,

447
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,359
but I would have thought that
making it appear

448
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,359
that a young woman
from a Republican community

449
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,519
has some kind of friendship
with a police officer

450
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,919
is only going to invite trouble.

451
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,599
The sort of trouble that might
get you targeted by a pipe bomb,

452
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,879
or get your lady friend murdered.

453
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,719
I object to the term "lady friend".

454
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,360
What level of friendship was it?

455
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,639
What do you mean?

456
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,279
She was an attractive young widow.

457
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,359
Yes.

458
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,639
And I was a married man!

459
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,988
According to the file,

460
00:23:57,989 --> 00:24:00,039
there were rumours you two
were conducting an affair.

461
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,759
Yeah, but that's what they were, rumours.

462
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,851
Just gossip, drummed up by
a bunch of people

463
00:24:03,852 --> 00:24:05,457
no better than they should've been.

464
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:07,659
Regardless, I'm sure you can see
how your intimacy

465
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,959
could've put Anne-Marie in jeopardy.

466
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,960
That's not what happened!

467
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,679
Did she meet a police
officer to pass information

468
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:23,300
on the evening of
Tuesday the 18th April 1989?

469
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,839
Yes.

470
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,039
You?

471
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,080
Yes.

472
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,519
What happened that night?

473
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,829
Well, she told me that
she'd made up some story

474
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,879
about going to visit a sick friend.

475
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,559
She passed the information to me.

476
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,199
And, as far as I know, she returned home.

477
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,959
Were you involved in her disappearance?

478
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,080
No.

479
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,959
As God is my witness, I was not.

480
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,799
According to the Missing Persons file,

481
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,559
you were the last person
to see her alive.

482
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,999
That is an equivocation,
Detective Chief Superintendent,

483
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,759
as well you know.

484
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,460
I'll rephrase.

485
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,679
You were the last person to admit
to police in an official statement

486
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,719
to seeing Anne-Marie McGillis alive.

487
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,319
I watched her walk down
the street, turn the corner.

488
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,999
Anne-Marie McGillis
trusted you implicitly?

489
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,319
Yes, I believe she did.

490
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,079
One theory considered by the RUC
is that you exploited that trust

491
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,367
- to lure Anne-Marie to her death.
- Completely false!

492
00:25:16,368 --> 00:25:17,759
The theory being that, as a Catholic,

493
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,519
you were susceptible to
relationships with

494
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,707
the very organisations that
Anne-Marie was informing on.

495
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:24,359
Look Growing up back then,
in the 70's, in the city,

496
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,319
they were everywhere.
They were part of the culture.

497
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,479
This sort of organisation?

498
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,679
Oh, come on now, I didn't want
any part of that.

499
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,999
I became a police officer.

500
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,839
Anything familiar about their appearance?

501
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,999
It was a different time,
a different thing entirely.

502
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,269
Nonetheless, they're wearing
the clothing associated with

503
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,879
organised crime groups
that AC12 have been investigating

504
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,399
- for seven years or more.
- There's no direct connection!

505
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,439
Anne-Marie McGillis' remains
weren't found until 2001.

506
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,519
Document 72.

507
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,999
Document 72 is the postmortem report
on Anne-Marie McGillis.

508
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,199
The cause of death was
a single gunshot wound to the head.

509
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,439
Additional gunshot wounds were detected

510
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,759
bilaterally on the victim's wrists,
knees and ankles.

511
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,999
Lesions caused by haemorrhage
indicate these gunshot wounds

512
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,239
were inflicted when the victim
was still alive.

513
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,634
Anne-Marie McGillis was tortured
in the same pattern

514
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:12,079
as that inflicted on your wife.

515
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,999
Yeah, but that's how
they did it back then.

516
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,279
But this does not necessitate
a direct connection.

517
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,679
Her son. Did you ever meet him?

518
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,940
Er...

519
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,479
No. She always left her son with
some neighbours or a family friend,

520
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,999
something like that.
She never wanted him involved.

521
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,599
When Anne-Marie disappeared,

522
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,439
her son was orphaned at the age of 10.

523
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,479
He was taken in by Anne-Marie's sister

524
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,599
and her brother-in-law,
who resided in Liverpool.

525
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,100
The boy was adopted
and he took their surname.

526
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,319
Corbett.

527
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,980
John Corbett.

528
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,040
Corbett was Anne-Marie's wee fella?

529
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,287
No.

530
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,919
Would you like to take a break, Ted?

531
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,120
Yes, of course.

532
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,500
OK.

533
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,239
Is there anything I can do to help?

534
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,720
Just give me a minute.

535
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,159
Mark Moffatt? DI Fleming.

536
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,679
DS Arnott. Do you have a minute, sir?

537
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,079
Sir's long gone.

538
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,479
Mark's fine.

539
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,919
I don't know if you remember us
from AC12.

540
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,199
- Can you give us a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

541
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,519
Water under the bridge,
as far as I'm concerned.

542
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,879
No hard feelings.

543
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,679
We'd like to ask you
a couple of questions

544
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,700
about your commercial relationship
with Superintendent Hastings.

545
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,319
Ted was a...

546
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,039
...an original investor in
a development that went south

547
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,759
about six years back.

548
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,599
We got it back on track,
so I offered Ted a buy-in

549
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,799
to try and recoup his original losses.

550
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,399
And did he?

551
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,039
Unfortunately, he couldn't come up
with the funds.

552
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,279
According to Superintendent Hastings,

553
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,959
you loaned him £50,000 off-book.

554
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,679
50?

555
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,039
Yeah, that's the figure we've been given.

556
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,820
I don't know how Ted's got that idea.

557
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,439
Does the name John Corbett
mean anything to you?

558
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,160
No, sorry.

559
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:02,186
If that's all...

560
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,759
Thanks for your time.

561
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,100
Give Ted my best.

562
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,959
Well, we drew a blank on Corbett.

563
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,479
Yeah, you saw his reaction
when we mentioned the 50 grand.

564
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,039
Something's not right.

565
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,700
We need to find out what.

566
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,399
Resuming interview.
You remain under caution.

567
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,839
Now, let's examine in more detail

568
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,439
some evidence we found in your
hotel room on the 14th of March.

569
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,680
Image 9.

570
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,879
You'll recall Image 9
shows item reference MB1.

571
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,399
You'll recall item reference MB1
is a brown envelope

572
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,759
addressed to you,
containing item reference MB2.

573
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,839
MB2 are banknotes in the sum of £50,000.

574
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:01,391
Superintendent Hastings has already
given a full and clear explanation

575
00:30:01,392 --> 00:30:03,839
regarding this item. To summarise,

576
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,279
it was an unsolicited advance
on future profits.

577
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,087
Superintendent Hastings
was extremely uncomfortable

578
00:30:10,088 --> 00:30:12,559
about the loan, and telephoned
Mark Moffat to return the money.

579
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,119
DI Brandyce.

580
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,759
We took further steps to detect
the source of said cash.

581
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,919
I told you, it came from Mark Moffatt.

582
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,220
DI Brandyce.

583
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,119
Document 40 in your folders.

584
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,488
Forensic analysis of banknotes MB2

585
00:30:26,489 --> 00:30:29,479
detected microscopic pollen deposits.

586
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,079
Pollen grains detected on MB2 were
subjected to chemical analysis.

587
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,799
The chemical structure of pollen
grains detected on MB2

588
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,799
closely resembles the chemical
structure of pollen grains

589
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,479
detected on items of evidence gathered

590
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,759
during AC-12's inquiry
into Operation Pear Tree.

591
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:51,079
Said evidence are item reference
JLM5 and item reference JD5.

592
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,780
Image 12, Tina.

593
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:59,213
Image 12 shows a cache of banknotes
in the sum of £25,000

594
00:30:59,214 --> 00:31:02,679
detected under floorboards
at 21 Cleric Way.

595
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,119
Do you recognise the banknotes
shown in the image,

596
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,279
- Superintendent Hastings?
- No, no, I do not.

597
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,199
Said banknotes were detected
at a property

598
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,359
belonging to a Vihaan Malhotra.

599
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,279
Image 31.

600
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,719
Image 31 shows item reference JD5.

601
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,430
JD5 is a cache of banknotes
in the sum of £5,000

602
00:31:20,431 --> 00:31:23,279
detected at 17 Hazelton Street.

603
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,359
Said banknotes were detected
at a property

604
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,679
belonging to PS Jane Cafferty.

605
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:32,679
The similar pollen structures
detected on items JD5, JLM5

606
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,799
and MB2 indicate a 99.5%
probability the items

607
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,199
derive from the same original source.

608
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,879
I have not been bribed!

609
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,759
The 50 grand found in your hotel room

610
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,559
came from the same pot as that
used to bribe Vihaan Malhotra

611
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,239
and PS Jane Cafferty.

612
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,359
And, according to evidence
obtained by your own unit,

613
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,843
those individuals were in the pay
of the same organised crime group

614
00:31:53,844 --> 00:31:55,679
in which John Corbett was embedded.

615
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,999
I do not have a connection
with Malhotra or Cafferty.

616
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,999
- This bribe proves you do.
- No.

617
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,639
Was it an inducement or
a reward for telling Lee Banks

618
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,559
the identity of the undercover
officer within the OCG?

619
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,999
I disclosed nothing to Banks.

620
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,559
A disclosure which brought
about the murder of John Corbett.

621
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,879
No.

622
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,640
What was Corbett on to that you were
so desperate to keep hidden?

623
00:32:18,213 --> 00:32:19,573
I'll repeat the question.

624
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,679
What was John Corbett on to that you
were so desperate to keep hidden?

625
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,720
Look...

626
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,719
...you have fabricated a motive
where none existed.

627
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,740
Who would want John Corbett dead?

628
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,439
- What do you mean?
- If you didn't, who would?

629
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,719
Well, clearly any individual

630
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,079
against whom John Corbett
might be gathering evidence,

631
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,946
including those members of the OCG
with whom he was embedded.

632
00:32:41,947 --> 00:32:44,039
Were there any specific
corrupt police officers

633
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,519
targeted by Operation Pear Tree?

634
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,519
- Not that I'm aware of.
- Mm.

635
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,039
Document 5 in your folders.

636
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,894
This is a copy of a document
seized by AC-12 on the...

637
00:32:54,919 --> 00:33:00,319
...23rd of February from the offices
of Operation Pear Tree.

638
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,380
I direct you to page 6, paragraph 6.

639
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,919
"It remains to be determined

640
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,719
"if police officers of senior
and/or executive rank

641
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,479

in organised criminal activities

642
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,639
"either as individuals
or as a conspiracy.

643
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,399
"A hypothesis to be examined
by the operation

644

"of senior or executive rank."

647
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,799
- Do you recognise those words?
- Yes. Yes. I've read the file.

648
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,263
There's a hell of a lot of
ifs and buts in that.

00:33:30,264 --> 00:33:33,959
Page 6, paragraph 8,
"Detective Inspector Matthew Cottan,

Who's top dog, Dot?

654
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,400
Caddy. No, you're The Caddy.
We know that.

655
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,679
- Told...
- Told!

656
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,640
You told someone. Someone very senior?

657
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,399
Prom...

658
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,559
Prom. Promotion? Someone promoted you?

659
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,999
Who? Come on, Dot.

660
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,640
Come in, he can't talk.

661
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,319
Right, blink with the first two
letters of his name.

I.

667
00:34:20,523 --> 00:34:22,519
H? His name begins with H.

668
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,279
Right second letter? A.

00:34:31,033 --> 00:34:32,393
I'll start bagging.

673
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,300
Thank you, Tina.

674
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,879
In his dying declaration,
DI Cottan declared

675
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,639
that the name of the senior officer

676
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:44,060
commanding the complicity
with organised crime began with H.

677
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,279
Page 6, paragraph 8 continued,

678
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,799
"An investigation by
Anticorruption Unit 12

679
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,039
"concluded in 2017 that H was

680
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,599
"Assistant Chief Constable Derek Hilton.

681
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,599
"Hilton was found dead
on the 5th of May 2017.

682
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,239
"However, the hypothesis must be
examined that H is

683
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,959
"an officer other than Hilton."
Do you recall these words?

684
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,239
Well, the evidence against Hilton
was overwhelming.

685
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,759
Clearly, if any new evidence
came to light,

686
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,959
AC-12 would gladly investigate.

687
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,660
Has any other officer
ever been accused of being H?

688
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,119
I'll repeat the question.

689
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,439
Has any other senior officer
ever been accused of being H?

690
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,360
- Yes.
- Who?

691
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,239
The accusation was a calculated falsehood

692
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:33,079
designed to sabotage a lawful
anticorruption inquiry.

693
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,919
Who was accused?

694
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,005
In an effort to sabotage an AC-12 inquiry

695
00:35:38,006 --> 00:35:39,839
that was about to uncover
his own offences,

696
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,519
Assistant Chief Constable
Derek Hilton falsely accused

697
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,655
the Senior Investigating Officer,
in order to discredit AC-12,

698
00:35:48,656 --> 00:35:52,359
discredit the inquiry,
and to protect his own wrongdoing.

699
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,420
The SIO being who?

700
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,559
Myself.

701
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,399
To be clear, you were served with
a Regulation 15 Notice.

702
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,679
The allegation against Superintendent
Hastings was disproved.

703
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,079
It wasn't disproved.

704
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,399
There was insufficient evidence
to prove it.

705
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,319
- I'd argue they're the same thing.
- They're not. They're really not.

706
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,639
Detective Chief Superintendent,
better to save the commentary

707
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,620
and stick to asking questions.

708
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,559
Just saying.

709
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,210
Actually, while I've got your attention,

710
00:36:23,211 --> 00:36:26,551
I wonder if we can dig into this search

711
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:28,919
of Superintendent Hastings' hotel room.

712
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,919
- This has all been covered.
- Not by me.

713
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,839
What were the grounds for the search?

714
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,360
Section 18.5.

715
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:42,693
Well, why then does
Document 12 in your folders,

716
00:36:42,694 --> 00:36:46,254
the arresting officer's report,
refer to Section 32

717
00:36:46,255 --> 00:36:48,799
as the legal power
used to carry out the search?

718
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,340
DI Brandyce?

719
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,199
The correct search form was supplied.

720
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,719
Afterwards, yes, but initially it seems

721
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,239
that the officers at the scene of
Superintendent Hastings' arrest

722
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,759
were under the impression

723
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,919
that the search was being
carried out under Section 32.

724
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,329
You were there at that time,

725
00:37:06,354 --> 00:37:07,799
- weren't you?
- Yes.

726
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:13,220
So, under what power did you
carry out the search at the time?

727
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,100
There was some confusion.

728
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,020
I see that, DI Brandyce.

729
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,319
You carried out the search
under Section 32.

730
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,039
There's even the original
search form in the file.

731
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,120
Thank you.

732
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,959
As we all know,

733
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,639
Section 32 permits the search
of a premises

734
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,479
the detainee was at
either at the time of his arrest

735
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,599
or immediately prior to that arrest.

736
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,930
I refer to Document 13
in your folders, the statement

737
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:47,439
given by Superintendent Hastings
on the 14th of March.

738
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,559
Superintendent Hastings states
that he travelled from this office,

739
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,439
Anticorruption Unit 12,
to the Edge Park Hotel.

740
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,839
Superintendent Hastings
wasn't in his hotel room

741
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,159
at the time of his arrest
or immediately prior.

742
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,999
Section 32 was the incorrect legal power.

743
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,959
This mistake was detected
and corrected only after the search.

744
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,079
As items MB1 and MB2 submitted in
evidence were detected unlawfully,

745
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,940
I can't see how the cache of £50,000

746
00:38:16,941 --> 00:38:20,039
can be used in evidence
against Superintendent Hastings.

747
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,919
Well, that is for a court to decide.

748
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,519
Given what I've heard, the judge
will almost certainly exclude it.

749
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,359
And it's the only evidence
that you've got

750
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:32,220
linking Superintendent Hastings
to organised crime.

751
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,069
I think we should call a temporary halt,

752
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:49,919
giving my team time
to examine further evidence.

753
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,439
Mr Hastings,
you'll be returned to custody

754
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,279
and charged or released within
24 hours of your original arrest.

755
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,839
Approximately six hours.

756
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,580
Interview terminated.

757
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,480
- May I?
- Yes, yes, of course.

758
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,999
Gill, I don't know what to say.

759
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,359
I am not going to lie, Ted,

760
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,839
it is a good job that someone
was paying attention.

761
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,096
God knows where your solicitor
was during all that.

762
00:39:24,097 --> 00:39:26,239
Everything is in here in black and white.

763
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,599
I know, I don't know why
I didn't see it myself.

764
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,119
The idea that you are corrupt
is ridiculous.

765
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,039
Clearly Mark Moffatt's
lying about the money.

766
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,500
You don't have a bent bone in your body.

767
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,879
This'll all go away, Ted.

768
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,920
Trust me.

769
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,404
Thanks, Gill. Thank you.

770
00:39:45,429 --> 00:39:46,980
- Yeah.,
- Yeah.

771
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,840
DI Fleming, DS Arnott to see DSU Powell.

772
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,500
It's fine. I've got this.

773
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,640
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.

774
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,319
Detective Superintendent Alison Powell

775
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,839
with DI Fleming, DS Arnott, AC-12.

776
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,839
Confirm that you grant permission
for this recording.

777
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,959
- DI Fleming, confirmed.
- DS Arnott, confirmed.

778
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,279
We'd like to fill in some background
on how John Corbett was recruited.

779
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,639
How was Corbett assigned as the UCO?

780
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,839
John was one of a number of
candidates considered for the role.

781
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,319
He presented with a distinguished record

782
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,639
of successful operations
against organised crime.

783
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,999
Did he come to you first, ma'am?
Did he volunteer?

784
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,240
What are you getting at, DI Fleming?

785
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,300
It's a straight question, ma'am.

786
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,359
There was a short list.
The candidates were evaluated.

787
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,759
Corbett was selected as
the right officer for the job.

788
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,260
Who selected him?

789
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,060
Look,

790
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,799
I made the recommendations
on Corbett, this was my operation,

791
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,560
but you can't put all of this on me,
I wasn't the only person involved.

792
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,160
Who else was involved
in selecting Corbett?

793
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,800
This is off the record.

794
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,919
How long have we got?

795
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,079
Just a few hours.

796
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,980
Going to have to blue-light it.

797
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,319
We just got the e-mail.

798
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,184
I'm calling for authentication. Thanks.

799
00:41:43,185 --> 00:41:46,119
Edward Hastings, new evidence
against you has come to light.

800
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,559
This evidence will be submitted
in written form

801
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,759
and you and your solicitor
will have four hours

802
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,319
to consider this evidence.

803
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,559
- What new evidence?
- Great, thanks.

804
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,119
Pending further investigation,

805
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,199
I'll be seeking an extension of 12 hours

806
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,759
to your permitted custody time.

807
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,439
- What evidence?
- Take him to the cells.

808
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,420
Come on, Ted, we should do as they say.

809
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,880
- Thank you, Tina.
- Ma'am.

810
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,820
Looks like we've got him, ma'am.

811
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,320
You nearly cost me this case.

812
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,679
I'll be expecting your transfer request

813
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,000
first thing in the morning.

814
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,959
Mrs Corbett.

815
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,519
We've got a new line of inquiry,
we need your urgent help with it.

816
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,159
May we come in please?

817
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,320
- Yeah, come in.
- Thanks.

818
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,960
Subject is in the building. Repeat,
the subject is in the building.

819
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,120
This must be awful for you, Ted.

820
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,919
Resuming interview of Edward Hastings.

821
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,119
You remain under caution.

822
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,799
Have you had an opportunity
to consider with your solicitor

823
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,640
the new documents disclosed to you?

824
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,759
I have.

825
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,992
Edward Hastings,

826
00:44:43,993 --> 00:44:46,159
when was the last time you were
in contact with John Corbett?

827
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,679
Never.

828
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,399
And have you ever been near enough

829
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,479
to make physical contact
with John Corbett?

830
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,080
Never.

831
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,759
I'll ask you again.

832
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,239
When were you last in physical
contact with John Corbett?

833
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,999
I only ever saw the fella once.

834
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,976
It was across a very busy street

835
00:45:02,977 --> 00:45:06,719
during an AC-12 surveillance operation.

836
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,439
It must have been 100 yards away.

837
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,602
As you'll have seen
in the disclosure documents,

838
00:45:10,603 --> 00:45:12,879
specifically Document 106
in your folders,

839
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,199
forensic examination
of John Corbett's body

840
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,879
has detected human hairs
not belonging to him.

841
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,079
Said hairs were attached
to follicular cells

842
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,119
which permitted DNA analysis.

843
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,159
The DNA found in these follicular cells

844
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,639
matches that of a person
on the police database

845
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,039
who is a police officer
who has submitted a DNA sample

846
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:33,879
for routine elimination
from crime scene contamination.

847
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,159
As you know from the documents
disclosed to you,

848
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,999
the DNA deposits detected
on John Corbett's body

849
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,479
match your elimination samples.

850
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,799
I've never been within
100 yards of John Corbett.

851
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,359
Your DNA was found on his body.

852
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,919
Can you explain this finding?

853
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,599
I can't! It must have been planted!

854
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,159
As a result of this evidence,
I have been in consultation

855
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,559
with the Senior Prosecutor
in the Complex Case Unit.

856
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,799
I did not kill Corbett!

857
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,679
She is satisfied that
the evidence against you

858
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,119
is sufficient to charge you
with the murder of John Corbett.

859
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,639
No, I'm being framed!

860
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,897
I'd now like to move on
to examine your motive

861
00:46:04,898 --> 00:46:06,305
for murdering John Corbett.

862
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:08,055
I did not murder Corbett!

863
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,559
May I ask, given the gravity of
the murder charge,

864
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,039
why are you continuing?

865
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,383
I have been tasked with investigating

866
00:46:14,384 --> 00:46:15,945
the highest level of corruption

867
00:46:15,946 --> 00:46:17,559
between police officers
and organised crime,

868
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:20,279
- the highest level.
- I am not corrupt!

869
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,679
I'm the one who's leading
the fight against corruption!

870
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,820
The highest level is
the individual codenamed H.

871
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,429
Significantly, Cottan led AC-12's inquiry

872
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:35,279
into the identity of the police officer

873
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,279
believed to be the intermediary
for organised crime,

874
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,719
codenamed The Caddy.

875
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,119
The Caddy was identified
as being Cottan himself.

876
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:45,559
Superintendent Hastings was
the Senior Investigating Officer

877
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,920
on the inquiry into H.

878
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,039
I see an interesting parallel there.

879
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:55,359
No, no. There's no parallel there.
I'm not H.

880
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,839
Still, there was
an allegation that you were.

881
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,041
Why were you so reluctant to entrust
the investigation

882
00:47:00,042 --> 00:47:01,768
into an independent anticorruption unit?

883
00:47:01,793 --> 00:47:02,879
I wasn't.

884
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,100
Why did you shoot Robert Denmoor?

885
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,731
Image 76 on screen.
Image 76 shows Robert Denmoor,

886
00:47:10,732 --> 00:47:13,959
a violent criminal with known
associations to organised crime.

887
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,599
Denmoor was incriminated in a plot

888
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,959
to tamper with evidence
in Operation Trapdoor.

889
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,439
Denmoor was shot
dead by Superintendent Hastings

890
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:24,599
on the ground floor of AC-12's
headquarters on the 4th of May 2017.

891
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,079
Yeah, Denmoor posed an immediate
threat to life

892
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,839
and lethal force was required
to stop him.

893
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:34,039
Therefore the Coroner recorded
a finding of lawful killing.

894
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:37,679
The official report records there
were a dozen AFOs on the scene,

895
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,159
and none of them opened fire.

896
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,679
In fact, according to the report,

897
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,219
you snatched a firearm
from a wounded AFO.

898
00:47:43,244 --> 00:47:44,311
Yeah, I did.

899
00:47:44,312 --> 00:47:47,079
The fatal round discharged by you
prevented questioning of Denmoor.

900
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,199
Prevented the loss of life.

901
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,879
Denmoor would have been a key witness

902
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,159
who could have confirmed Hilton as H.

903
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,879
- Yes.
- Or excluded him.

904
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,319
Yes, also.

905
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,439
You were prepared to lose
that priceless evidence,

906
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,759
the same judgment you demonstrated
on the 12th of March

907
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:04,399
when you ordered DS Arnott to deploy
lethal force against John Corbett.

908
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,959
Look, I told you, Corbett was armed,

909
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,519
he was responsible for the death
of Maneet Bindra,

910
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,599
Lester Hargreaves,

911
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,879
I gave the order to
safeguard my officer's life!

912
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,547
Corbett was notifying DS Arnott
of a meeting

913
00:48:15,548 --> 00:48:18,159
with a high-ranking nominal
who could well have been H.

914
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,719
Corbett was a liar.

915
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,079
He was playing games with all of us.

916
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,679
He was a decorated undercover officer

917
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,039
whose courageous actions in the past
had brought to justice

918
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,359
hardened members of
organised criminal groups.

919
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,319
Corbett gave DS Arnott alone
the details of the meeting with H.

920
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,359
He did.

921
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,439
You ordered DS Arnott
to disclose those details?

922
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,599
You're damn right I did,
I was his commanding officer,

923
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,639
for Christ's sake.
What the hell's going on here?

924
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,759
And at said meeting, the same day,
the 12th of March,

925
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,835
at the Palisades Shopping Centre,
what happened then?

926
00:48:43,836 --> 00:48:46,519
- No meeting took place.
- Why do you think that was?

927
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,959
Well, Corbett was about to be
apprehended by AC-12.

928
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,759
I suspect that he, you know, lied
about the meeting at the Palisades

929
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,239
to secure his own escape.

930
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,260
Or he was telling the truth
and the information was leaked to H.

931
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,660
We detected no evidence of a leak.

932
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,439
We examined your personal
communications records

933
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,999
and found no suspicious calls.

934
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,199
However I do need you to account
for two unexplained findings.

935
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,039
We've detected activity
in the vicinity of AC-12

936
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,599
on unregistered mobile phones,

937
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:20,319
so-called burner phones
used for illicit communications.

938
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,799
We've identified a specific
burner phone. Tina, thank you.

939
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,759
Document 92.
Document 92 is a call history

940
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:32,162
of an unregistered mobile, 07700900856.

941
00:49:32,163 --> 00:49:33,799
The device shows clusters of activity

942
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,839
in the vicinity of AC-12
over the last six weeks

943
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:40,679
and also engaged in communication
with other burner phones.

944
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,839
Cross checking with door entry
download data

945
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,879
reveals only one AC-12 officer
was present in the building

946
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:50,639
on every occasion 07700900856
was detected.

947
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,479
That officer was
Superintendent Edward Hastings.

948
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:58,534
Is 07700900856 your phone?

949
00:49:58,535 --> 00:49:59,759
No, it is not.

950
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,279
- Did you dispose of the phone?
- There was never a phone.

951
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:05,320
Have you ever disposed
of a communications device?

952
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,079
- Tina.
- Document 24.

953
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,466
Document 24 shows screenshots
from a laptop

954
00:50:13,467 --> 00:50:15,759
forensically recovered
from the Flicker nightclub

955
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,279
used by Lisa McQueen and
John Corbett to communicate with H.

956
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,279
As we can see,
H issued his orders via text.

957
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,326
I'll repeat the question.
Have you ever disposed

958
00:50:25,327 --> 00:50:27,119
- of a communications device?
- No.

959
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,719
- PS Tranter, thank you.
- As stated by DCS Carmichael,

960
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,319
we examined the communication
history of Edward Hastings.

961
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:35,799
Document 28 in your folders
is said communication history

962
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,119
relating to your personal
registered mobile telephone

963
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,919
and your work registered
mobile telephone.

964
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,279
From these phones we've been able
to harvest location data.

965
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,919
We detected suspicious behaviour
on the 5th of March.

966
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,239
Location data places both phones
at the Edge Park Hotel

967
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,639
around 15:00 hours that day.

968
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,399
The user then switches off both
phones for the rest of the day.

969
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,359
When location data resumes
the next day, the 6th of March,

970
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,959
the phones are back
in the Edge Park Hotel.

971
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,559
Why did you switch off your phones?

972
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,479
I... I really don't recall.

973
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:11,239
Do you recall the significance
of that date, the 5th of March?

974
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,719
- No.
- That night,

975
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,559
the OCG carried out an armed robbery
at the Eastfield Depot,

976
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,079
making away with seized goods

977
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,519
with an estimated street value
of £50 million.

978
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,439
Yeah, OK, look, I'm sorry.

979
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,999
I mean,
the date must have slipped my mind.

980
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,279
Where were you from 15:00 hours
on the 5th of March?

981
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,519
Well, I remained...

982
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,799
I remained in and around
the Edge Park Hotel,

983
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,919
on standby for developments
for AC-12's surveillance operation

984
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,759
on the Eastfield Depot.

985
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,279
This was a hugely important operation.

986
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,479
Wasn't it essential
that you be contactable?

987
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,959
Well, I... We'd established
a direct line of communication

988
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,239
through Airwave radio and I had
direct dial access to my officers.

989
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,639
My own works phone was redundant.

990
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,940
Why didn't you attend
the operation in person?

991
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,279
To ensure operational independence.

992
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:06,159
DI Fleming, she acted as
the Tactical Firearms Commander

993
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,159
under an independent
Strategic Firearms Commander.

994
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,599
The result being that
your whereabouts were unknown

995
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,479
until you made contact via an
Airwave radio much later that night.

996
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,079
That's neither here nor there.

997
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:19,119
We attempted to trace your movements
on the 5th of March.

998
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,639
Tina, thank you.

999
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,959
Starting from a radius of 100 metres
around the Edge Park Hotel,

1000
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,999
we examined CCTV and traffic cameras.

1001
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,479
Image 32.

1002
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,880
Who's seen in this image?

1003
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:31,519
Me.

1004
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,200
What's the package you're carrying?

1005
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,839
I'm reserving comment.

1006
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,519
We were able to trace the taxi's journey

1007
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:41,039
to a drop-off point
in the Moss Heath area.

1008
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,759
Again, we examined CCTV cameras
in a 100-metre radius.

1009
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,479
Image 33.

1010
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,100
Who's seen in this image?

1011
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,199
Me.

1012
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,060
What are you doing in this image?

1013
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,079
We know from the recovered laptop
from the nightclub

1014
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:06,839
that the OCG communicated with H
via online messaging.

1015
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,602
Examination of the OCG laptop's
hard drive

1016
00:53:10,603 --> 00:53:16,185
revealed a sophisticated
re-routing system via various VPNs

1017
00:53:16,186 --> 00:53:18,613
to disguise H's IP address.

1018
00:53:18,614 --> 00:53:21,359
And while we're still unable
to determine H's location,

1019
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:24,119
we know for certain that
the hard drive of the computer

1020
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,879
would contain metadata
proving it was used

1021
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,759
to communicate with the OCG.

1022
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:33,620
Evidence that he would take
great pains to... dispose of.

1023
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,240
OK.

1024
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,140
Well, we shall come back to it.

1025
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,359
As we've established, the night
of the 5th of March

1026
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,440
saw the OCG robbery
at the Eastfield Depot.

1027
00:54:03,441 --> 00:54:05,266
At 22:40 hours that night,

1028
00:54:05,267 --> 00:54:08,256
a status zero radio call was
made by PC Kieran Bloom

1029
00:54:08,257 --> 00:54:10,519
requesting urgent assistance
to Farmer's Lane.

1030
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,879
How did you respond
to that emergency call?

1031
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,759
The Authorised Firearms Officers
who were giving assistance

1032
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,319
to the AC-12 surveillance
of the Eastfield Depot

1033
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,359
were the nearest armed response unit.

1034
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:24,999
And so given our responsibility
towards preserving life,

1035
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,919
I authorised the AFOs
to render assistance.

1036
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:33,477
As a result of your actions,
the OCG were able to flee Eastfield

1037
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:36,479
with £50 million worth of seized goods.

1038
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,279
My decision was based on saving
police officers' lives.

1039
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,719
Priceless, I would say.

1040
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,759
H would have wanted the robbery
to succeed, wouldn't he,

1041
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,919
so that he could have
shared in the proceeds?

1042
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,680
That's hypothetical.

1043
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:55,599
You went to a nightclub
known to be an OCG haunt,

1044
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:59,919
in the hope of effecting a meeting,
without independent authorisation.

1045
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,119
Yeah, well, look...
You know, they'd killed Maneet,

1046
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:06,879
they'd murdered Lester Hargreaves,
they'd held up the Eastfield depot.

1047
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,679
- Time was running out.
- You pretended to be H

1048
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,119
successfully enough for the OCG
to share with you

1049
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,572
the proceeds of the Eastfield Robbery.

1050
00:55:14,573 --> 00:55:17,599
No. I was using them to find out
where the proceeds were hidden.

1051
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,018
Who better to impersonate
H than H himself?

1052
00:55:20,019 --> 00:55:23,690
No. That is not what was happening!
It's like I told you,

1053
00:55:23,691 --> 00:55:25,719
look, time was running out.
I was desperate.

1054
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,999
Well, it's convenient
to rationalise all this

1055
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,239
as the desperation of a failing SIO.

1056
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,119
But before we do,

1057
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,919
let's consider the communications
made between Corbett and you

1058
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,519
via a computer link. Tina.

1059
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,959
Document 105 in your folders
and on screen.

1060
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:44,639
Document 105 is a transcript
of a written message composed by you

1061
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,760
and transmitted on the evening
of the 12th of March.

1062
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,879
Please look at line 3, which reads,

1063
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,879
"I can definately pull
the right strings."

1064
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,999
Note the misspelling of "definitely".

1065
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,239
Going back to earlier messages
believed to have been written by H,

1066
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:03,439
please look at the message
transmitted on the 3rd of March,

1067
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:07,639
"Eastfield Depot is definately high
risk." Again, note the misspelling.

1068
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:10,279
How closely had you studied
the messages by H?

1069
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,519
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Quite closely.

1070
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:15,679
Closely enough to duplicate the
misspelling of this particular word?

1071
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,359
Yes.

1072
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:21,097
You're the SIO on one of the biggest
anticorruption operations

1073
00:56:21,098 --> 00:56:22,359
this force has ever seen,

1074
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:26,239
and you have the headspace
to learn to spell like H?

1075
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,719
Yes.

1076
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,639
Isn't it more likely that you
inadvertently misspelled this word?

1077
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,202
- No.
- No? Isn't it more likely

1078
00:56:32,227 --> 00:56:33,799
that you made the same mistake as H

1079
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,700
- because you are H?
- I am not H.

1080
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,919
Looking at another part
of the impersonated message

1081
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,119
you composed, line 4, "I need you
to bring all this to a close."

1082
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,679
What did you mean by that?

1083
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:49,759
What H meant was that
the Eastfield goods were a liability

1084
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,839
and needed to be taken
out of the country quickly.

1085
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,199
It could imply another meaning,

1086
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,399
that you were giving the order
to execute John Corbett.

1087
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,519
No! Absolutely not!

1088
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,999
What private material was stored
on the hard drive

1089
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,919
of the laptop computer that
you erased on the 5th of March?

1090
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,919
No, it's not relevant to this inquiry.

1091
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,719
If we'd been able to find H's computer,

1092
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:07,999
we'd have the proof we needed.

1093
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,279
You disposed of your computer
because you knew that.

1094
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:13,228
That it would prove beyond all
reasonable doubt that you are H.

1095
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:14,176
No.

1096
00:57:14,201 --> 00:57:16,540
Then why did you dispose of the computer?

1097
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,340
I was looking at pornography.

1098
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,159
Nothing illegal, nothing extreme.

1099
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,919
I just did not want it to be found.

1100
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,359
That's all.

1101
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,999
Nothing illegal or extreme,

1102
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,319
but you went to the lengths
of disposing of the computer?

1103
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,239
Look, it was private stuff,
so, you know...

1104
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,839
My wife has left me, and...

1105
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,086
Jesus Christ.

1106
00:57:44,087 --> 00:57:46,559
Look, I really don't want to discuss it.

1107
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:50,159
And after you entered the nightclub
as part of your...

1108
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,181
...unauthorised undercover operation,

1109
00:57:53,182 --> 00:57:55,759
you were next located where
the Eastfield goods

1110
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,239
were being concealed.

1111
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,199
It was pure chance,
an active burner phone

1112
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,159
inadvertently left on by an OCG member,

1113
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,279
that meant you were found.

1114
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,079
We could be forgiven for thinking
that you didn't want to be found.

1115
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,719
No, that's simply not true.

1116
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,679
The net was closing in. Your
identity was slowly being unmasked.

1117
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:13,699
You reunited with the OCG
in order to share in the profits

1118
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,718
of the Eastfield robbery.

1119
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:17,320
Look, no... Look, look...

1120
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:23,239
I had risked my life and my career
in order to catch them.

1121
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:26,239
The two most precious things
to me in the whole world,

1122
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,599
I laid them on the line,

1123
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:31,239
because I was so determined,

1124
00:58:31,639 --> 00:58:35,399
and I was so desperate
that AC-12 would not fail.

1125
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,159
Do you know, one thing
I keep going back to

1126
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:43,007
is that dying declaration
by DI Cottan. Tina, thank you.

1127
00:58:43,008 --> 00:58:45,599
Cottan, your own officer,
named the top man as H.

1128
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:49,439
And now, finally, there's
overwhelming evidence that H is you.

1129
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,159
I'm not H.

1130
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,429
John Corbett was proving

1131
00:58:52,454 --> 00:58:53,914
- the trail led to your door.
- No.

1132
00:58:53,915 --> 00:58:55,000
That's why you had John Corbett

1133
00:58:55,025 --> 00:58:56,079
- murdered.
- No.

1134
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,181
You ordered DS Arnott to shoot him dead.

1135
00:58:58,182 --> 00:58:59,759
- No.
- And when that plan failed,

1136
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,559
you visited Lee Banks
in Blackthorn Prison

1137
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:04,359
and revealed to him that Corbett
was an undercover police officer.

1138
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,039
- No. No.
- But killing Corbett wasn't enough.

1139
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,519
You needed to know what
he had on you, didn't you?

1140
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,835
- No.
- And that was the biggest mistake

1141
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:12,039
that you made.

1142
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,759
Because in the final meeting
with Corbett,

1143
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,359
before you slashed his throat

1144
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:18,319
and dumped him at the breakers yard,

1145
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:21,038
one of your hairs
contaminated Corbett's body.

1146
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:22,220
NO!

1147
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,639
Edward Hastings, H,

1148
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,239
I have been in consultation with
the Senior Prosecutor

1149
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:32,279
at the Complex Case Unit and
I will now go back to her

1150
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,519
seeking authority to charge you
with the murder of John Corbett,

1151
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:39,679
conspiracy to commit armed robbery
and malfeasance in a public office.

1152
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,319
I think it might be helpful

1153
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:44,359
if Mr Hastings is given some time
with his solicitor.

1154
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,600
Fine by me.

1155
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,679
Thank you, Tina, well done.

1156
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:49,960
Ma'am.

1157
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,360
Interview terminated at 21:46.

1158
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,720
Where's the AFOs?

1159
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:09,959
Kyle?

1160
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,399
Ma'am.

1161
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,867
I thought there was meant to be
armed support

1162
01:00:12,868 --> 01:00:15,119
while the gaffer was being interviewed?

1163
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,199
Looks like it's been scaled back.

1164
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,559
It'll be down to other
operational commitments.

1165
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:22,220
- Always is.
- OK.

1166
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,879
You've got to hand it to Carmichael.

1167
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:34,679
There's a lot stacking up.

1168
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,867
And that's with setting aside

1169
01:00:36,868 --> 01:00:38,919
the bundle of cash in your hotel room.

1170
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,560
- Which I was about to return!
- All of it?

1171
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,911
Moffatt denies any knowledge of the money

1172
01:00:45,912 --> 01:00:48,239
so nobody's put the exact sum to him.

1173
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:51,479
But according to the files,
the amount required to buy in

1174
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:54,260
to the property development
wasn't 50 grand...

1175
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,839
...it was 100.

1176
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:01,540
Now, if there is another
50 grand somewhere...

1177
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,740
...eventually someone's going to find it.

1178
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,759
Now, I'm on your side, Ted.

1179
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,799
But if I was on a jury,

1180
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,559
I'd say this all looks damning.

1181
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,519
Now, I'm confident I can talk
the PCC into

1182
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,559
applying political pressure to
suppress Carmichael's investigation.

1183
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,679
Much better to blow our trumpets
about recovering the stolen goods

1184
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,820
and neutralising the OCG.

1185
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,799
You'll have to accept a misconduct charge

1186
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,759
for carrying out unauthorised operations

1187
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:31,119
and resign from the force.

1188
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,460
No doubt AC-12 will be disbanded.

1189
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,679
Thank you, yes, the threshold tests
have been met definitely.

1190
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,119
What's going on?

1191
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,320
The DCS is on to the Crown Prosecutor.

1192
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,520
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.

1193
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:55,520
- DS Arnott.
- DI Fleming.

1194
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:03,159
Well, the last thing I need right
now is another knife in me back.

1195
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:05,119
That was never our intention, sir.

1196
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,580
Yeah? Funny way of showing it.

1197
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,039
We've been making inquiries
into some of the gaps

1198
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:14,119
in our understanding of Corbett's
involvement in Operation Pear Tree.

1199
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:16,559
Yeah. Under whose orders? Hers?

1200
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,599
No, sir, on our own.

1201
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:20,340
We're just trying to find the truth.

1202
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,399
What's going on?

1203
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,531
We've gathered further information
that may be relevant

1204
01:02:25,532 --> 01:02:28,039
- to your inquiry.
- You can brief me in private.

1205
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,559
If it's OK with you, ma'am,
we intend to share our findings

1206
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:33,719
with Superintendent Hastings
and his solicitor.

1207
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,999
His solicitor is making calls.

1208
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,239
Yeah, well, they've come to talk to me

1209
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,119
and I'd like to hear what
they've got to say.

1210
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:43,340
Quite right. It's up to you
if you want to be in on it or not.

1211
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,799
Operation Pear Tree
was originally authorised

1212
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,439
following an instruction
from Rohan Sindwhani,

1213
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,279
the Police and Crime Commissioner.

1214
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:56,639
Sindwhani had made an election
promise to tackle police corruption.

1215
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,319
The specific remit of Pear Tree
is to examine whether complicity

1216
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:02,999
between organised crime
and police officers

1217
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,479
has been institutionalised in this force.

1218
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,279
Detective Superintendent Alison Powell,

1219
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,159
having no connection to Central Police,

1220
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,839
was brought in to lead Pear Tree.

1221
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:13,039
Powell identified suitable
undercover officers

1222
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,119
from outside forces

1223
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:17,439
and submitted their CVs to
Deputy Chief Constable Andrea Wise.

1224
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,159
Following a consultation process,

1225
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,319
John Corbett was selected to be the UCO.

1226
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,519
Bear in mind, Corbett's background
was available to be examined

1227
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:25,879
as part of the process.

1228
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:29,719
This was before his service record
was erased from the database

1229
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,479
and large portions of the Pear Tree
files were redacted.

1230
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,068
DSU Powell informed us

1231
01:03:34,069 --> 01:03:36,999
that PCC Sindwhani took no part
in the selection process,

1232
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,079
but it was agreed
his Senior Legal Counsel

1233
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,639
would act on his behalf.

1234
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,281
I don't need to remind everyone

1235
01:03:42,282 --> 01:03:45,559
there's been controversies
surrounding undercover operations.

1236
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:50,719
The PCC required assurances that
Pear Tree was legally watertight.

1237
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,479
According to DSU Powell,

1238
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:56,039
the Senior Legal Counsel
strongly favoured Corbett

1239
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,719
and was instrumental in selecting him.

1240
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,689
Corbett had a distinguished record

1241
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:02,519
handling the perils of being embedded

1242
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,439
inside an organised crime group.

1243
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,079
He was by far the best man for the job.

1244
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:11,839
Ms Biggeloe, when did you first
become aware of John Corbett?

1245
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:16,860
When we looked at the files
to select an undercover officer.

1246
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,039
Gill Biggeloe, you do not have to
say anything

1247
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,510
but it may harm your defence if you
do not mention when questioned

1248
01:04:22,511 --> 01:04:23,863
something you later rely on in court.

1249
01:04:23,864 --> 01:04:26,280
Anything you do say
may be used in evidence.

1250
01:04:32,773 --> 01:04:33,973
OK.

1251
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,879
Well, given that the DIR's off,

1252
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:39,919
I'd like to make my own
personal recording.

1253
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,479
Any objections?

1254
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:44,999
I think we need to take
a step back, actually.

1255
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,359
Recording on.

1256
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:49,559
If you could kindly bear with us, ma'am.

1257
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,900
Ms Biggeloe, did you
ever meet John Corbett?

1258
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:55,319
I refer you to my previous response.

1259
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,719
DS Arnott.

1260
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,185
As part of our inquiry,
we interviewed Corbett's widow,

1261
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:01,079
Stephanie. On the first occasion,

1262
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:03,839
she confirmed Corbett's
upbringing in Northern Ireland.

1263
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,629
Following our interview with DSU Powell,

1264
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:08,359
we went back to Mrs Corbett
with some specific questions

1265
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:11,439
regarding John Corbett's recruitment
to Operation Pear Tree.

1266
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,799
We managed to convince her to
cooperate with our inquiry

1267
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,919
and reveal hitherto undisclosed evidence.

1268
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,079
Following a lawful search
of the family home

1269
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,759
under Mrs Corbett's guidance,

1270
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:23,199
we recovered items concealed
by her husband.

1271
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,759
Among the items was
an audio recording of a meeting

1272
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,839
between John Corbett and Gill Biggeloe

1273
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,639
which took place in January 2018,

1274
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:33,319
a full month before the inception
of Operation Pear Tree.

1275
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:36,959
Well, if such a recording exists,
it's inadmissible.

1276
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,559
That is correct that if acting
on official police business,

1277
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:43,156
Corbett would have required
authorisation from Ripa.

1278
01:05:43,157 --> 01:05:46,039
Yeah, well, he wasn't acting on
official police business,

1279
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:48,279
and I can assure you that
my legal team and I

1280
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,799
will move heaven and Earth

1281
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:53,300
so that this particular recording
will be heard in court.

1282
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:55,679
Playing recording.

1283
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,599
The RUC officer who betrayed your mother,

1284
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,340
his name's Hastings.

1285
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,940
Superintendent Ted Hastings.

1286
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,759
He's a Super now. That's taking the piss.

1287
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,439
How do you know all this?

1288
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:14,879
From a private investigator who's
been looking into Hastings' past.

1289
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,159
It's all in the file, chapter and verse.

1290
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:22,839
You read it and then tell me
how you feel about my proposal.

1291
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,580
I'm in. Tell me now.

1292
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:28,480
We're setting up an undercover
operation to prove he's bent.

1293
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,679
To finally bring down the man

1294
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,759
who had your mother killed.

1295
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,999
And it's definitely him, Hastings?

1296
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,040
Yeah.

1297
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:43,839
Gill Biggeloe sought incriminating
material on Superintendent Hastings

1298
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,425
and then used it to manipulate
John Corbett

1299
01:06:46,426 --> 01:06:50,200
into believing
Superintendent Hastings is H.

1300
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:53,740
Why, Gill?

1301
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,359
It's complicated.

1302
01:07:03,627 --> 01:07:04,867
We've got time.

1303
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,260
Actually, you don't.

1304
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:13,960
I'm TFC! Guns down. Stand by!

1305
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:17,879
OK. We need to shut
this building down right now.

1306
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,180
- Guns down now!
- Do as he says.

1307
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,319
TFC now. Received, moving in.

1308
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:25,879
Guns down.

1309
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:27,599
Hands where we can see them.

1310
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,020
- Hands above your head.
- Who authorised this?

1311
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:33,999
We detected apparent security lapses
on entering the building.

1312
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,879
The SFC authorised us to deploy firearms.

1313
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,600
All your AFOs are being
disarmed as a precaution.

1314
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,439
This burner phone,

1315
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,559
it isn't the same burner phone
that I've been accused of owning,

1316
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,679
by any chance, Tina, is it?

1317
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,599
Tina, the number.

1318
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:59,220
07700900856.

1319
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,479
Oh, yeah.

1320
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:06,959
There it is.

1321
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,239
You see Gill only ever visited me
when she came to AC-12.

1322
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,300
That's how you mistook
this phone for mine.

1323
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:18,900
TFC, 6-4, any obs on OCG?

1324
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,540
6-4, no contact yet, stand by.

1325
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,519
Looks like the cavalry's
not coming over the hill.

1326
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:30,199
Yeah, the last time Dot Cottan
sent that message out,

1327
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,879
he was busted out in a couple of seconds.

1328
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,399
Looks like you're not as valuable as him.

1329
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:38,119
Or as valuable as you thought you were.

1330
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:40,079
As valuable to who exactly?

1331
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:43,199
Well, Gill told me that
she was a defence solicitor.

1332
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:45,719
You're going to meet a lot of
shady types doing that job.

1333
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:50,839
So you get some major piece of work
off a serious criminal charge,

1334
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,839
they put you on a retainer.

1335
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:56,519
But these retainers, they come with
strings attached, don't they, Gill?

1336
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:59,460
But I suspect that she was
enticed by the glamour.

1337
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,879
Why frame the gaffer?

1338
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:04,479
It's always more palatable
to offer up a rotten apple

1339
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:07,919
than to uncover
institutionalised corruption.

1340
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:13,199
And as AC-12 have been a constant
thorn in the side of the OCG,

1341
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:17,040
what better rotten apple than their
commanding officer, right, Gill?

1342
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:24,400
The money in the hotel room,
where did that come from?

1343
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:28,359
I bet you asked some of
your little criminal mates

1344
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:31,239
to slip that through to Moffatt,
am I right?

1345
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:34,199
There's damning DNA evidence
against Superintendent Hastings.

1346
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:38,320
Hardly damning, a couple
of hair follicles? Come on.

1347
01:09:43,566 --> 01:09:44,926
Hang on.

1348
01:09:46,953 --> 01:09:48,953
Don't tell me, was that your doing, Gill?

1349
01:09:50,166 --> 01:09:51,605
Don't worry, Ted,

1350
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:54,350
I'll spare your blushes
in front of everyone.

1351
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:59,580
Gill used the bathroom of my hotel room.

1352
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:03,199
She must have taken some hairs
out of the comb,

1353
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:07,540
passed them on to the OCG and
they planted them on Corbett's body.

1354
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:10,720
Who killed Corbett?

1355
01:10:11,919 --> 01:10:13,399
Did you give the order?

1356
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:19,359
We all know confessing
to conspiracy to murder

1357
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:23,460
will make me ineligible
for immunity from prosecution.

1358
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:28,412
And the institutionalised
complicity between organised crime

1359
01:10:28,413 --> 01:10:30,340
and corrupt police officers?

1360
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,439
Have you not been listening, love?

1361
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,279
There's no such thing.

1362
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,160
I'm just one rotten apple.

1363
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,799
Well, never mind betraying me, Gill.

1364
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,559
Never mind framing me.
What about John Corbett?

1365
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:47,300
I mean, you let him believe
that he was chasing the truth.

1366
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,559
Justice for his mother,

1367
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,879
for Christ's sake, for Anne-Marie.

1368
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:55,199
But instead he was chasing a lie.

1369
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,919
You set it running,

1370
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:00,719
then you sat around as you watched
the dogs rip it apart.

1371
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:03,620
A tragic, senseless death.

1372
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:12,359
3-7, 6-4, sit rep.

1373
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,580
6-4, still no obs.

1374
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,300
Received.

1375
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,319
Ma'am, it appears we no longer need
to defend ourselves

1376
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:20,919
against a threat in this building.

1377
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:22,319
I suggest we make arrangements

1378
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:25,119
to transport
Miss Biggeloe to custody ASAP.

1379
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,599
Agreed.

1380
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:29,319
- I'll take care of that, ma'am.
- Thank you, Tina.

1381
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31,559
Gill Biggeloe,
you are under arrest for perverting

1382
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:34,640
the course of justice
and misconduct in a public office.

1383
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:39,300
Sir, I'd advise you
get out the building too.

1384
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:42,220
Yeah. Thank you, Kate.

1385
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,839
I'm afraid I'm going to have to cuff you.

1386
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:53,319
Could be a trek to custody. You
might want to do a loo break now.

1387
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:54,999
Thank you.

1388
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,360
Going to have to come with you,
I'm sorry.

1389
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:02,199
- 3-7, 6-4.
- 6-4 receiving.

1390
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,039
We're sending down DCS Carmichael
and the gaffer.

1391
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:08,119
We'll keep Gill Biggeloe up here
until we can provide escort.

1392
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,540
- 6-4, received.
- Thanks, you two.

1393
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:12,679
I don't know what to say.

1394
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:14,439
You're welcome, sir.

1395
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:15,940
Just doing our job.

1396
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,740
It's a damn sight more than that.

1397
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,760
I could murder a cuppa.

1398
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,639
Ah!

1399
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,760
Help!

1400
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,480
Drop it!

1401
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,799
Alpha Charlie 3-7, request urgent casevac

1402
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,399
from AC-12 for two persons,

1403
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,679
one low-velocity GSW, one knife wound.

1404
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:37,359
- Gill, are you all right?
- Yeah.

1405
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,620
Steve.

1406
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,180
Steve, are you all right?

1407
01:13:43,526 --> 01:13:45,006
I never shot anybody.

1408
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:56,560
Can you confirm, premises now secure?

1409
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,799
Yes, confirmed.

1410
01:14:05,806 --> 01:14:07,086
Do you think she'll talk?

1411
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:10,119
She'll want to make a deal.

1412
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,900
Too fond of the finer things
to do a prison stretch.

1413
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,639
The OCG didn't think Gill
was worth saving,

1414
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,000
but someone gave the order
to stop her talking.

1415
01:14:33,526 --> 01:14:34,966
Who?

1416
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,460
What is it?

1417
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:10,680
Out of the way.

1418
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,520
I'll start bagging, respiratory arrest...

1419
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:19,719
Gone through my solicitor,
and she's advised me

1420
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,719
to cooperate with your inquiry

1421
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:24,759
but it all depends if there's
definitely immunity

1422
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:27,820
from prosecution, and witness protection.

1423
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:29,680
I want to help.

1424
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,839
Maybe I could do something

1425
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:35,239
to stop others from making
the same mistakes.

1426
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:39,319
Immunity from prosecution and
witness protection has been agreed.

1427
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:42,020
There is one final gap
we need to fill in.

1428
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:46,119
How did you know that John Clayton
was an undercover officer,

1429
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:47,400
DS John Corbett?

1430
01:15:48,853 --> 01:15:49,893
I didn't.

1431
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,399
Just that he was a rat.

1432
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,620
How?

1433
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:56,520
The leak about the meeting
at the Palisades.

1434
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,919
It could have only come from him.

1435
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,759
How did that work?

1436
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:05,559
John was told the top man wanted
to meet at the shopping centre.

1437
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:08,399
We had a meeting point
on one of the walkways.

1438
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:11,199
It was nice and public
so if anyone spotted us

1439
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,600
they'd think twice about
trying to take us out.

1440
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,280
No-one else in the unit knew about
the meet except for me and John.

1441
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:22,719
We had one of our blokes working
the shopping centre in security.

1442
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:25,479
He said he'd seen the coppers
waiting to ambush us.

1443
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:28,860
So we knew for certain the leak
had to come from John.

1444
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:32,260
What did Lee Banks reveal to you
about John Corbett?

1445
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,040
Only that there was a rat in the unit.

1446
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:39,759
Hastings told Lee Banks
about Corbett, I'm sure of it.

1447
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,280
She's lying to cover herself.

1448
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:44,159
She knows if she admits
to killing Corbett

1449
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,800
then she forfeits immunity
from prosecution.

1450
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:50,319
What does Banks say?

1451
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,920
He's still not talking.

1452
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,399
Then, without his testimony,

1453
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:58,200
you can't prove Hastings blew
Corbett's cover.

1454
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:01,359
It's a dead end, Patricia.
Close the case.

1455
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:05,220
- Ma'am, I think if I can just keep...
- You had a bent officer on your team.

1456
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:07,800
Glass houses.

1457
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:16,679
Which OCG members were involved

1458
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:18,119
in the murder of John Corbett?

1459
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:19,780
A few of them.

1460
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,879
Not me.

1461
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,559
They're all dead now.

1462
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,159
Who inflicted the fatal knife wound

1463
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:28,640
that caused John Corbett
to bleed to death?

1464
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,480
He's dead now too.

1465
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,640
Miroslav Minkowicz.

1466
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:39,100
Are there any members
of the OCG still at large?

1467
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,280
Not that I know of.

1468
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:54,479
Where I grew up, it was easy
to fall in with the wrong crowd.

1469
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:58,320
My mum, she was off her face on
drink and drugs a lot of the time.

1470
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,857
The person who made me see
that there was another way,

1471
01:18:01,858 --> 01:18:03,752
to be a useful member of society,

1472
01:18:03,753 --> 01:18:06,720
was a police officer, PC Simon Bannerjee.

1473
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:10,540
He's the reason why I wanted
to become a police officer too.

1474
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:12,880
To help people.

1475
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:25,680
- Sir.
- Sir.

1476
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,359
We've been re-examining
Dot's dying declaration.

1477
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:32,879
Now, the frame it was frozen on
during your interview

1478
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,879
made me spot something we've all missed.

1479
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,640
Look at Dot's left hand.

1480
01:18:43,213 --> 01:18:44,413
Watch again.

1481
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:51,680
Right, so his fingers are tapping. So?

1482
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:55,999
Dot was trying to tell us something
before he lost consciousness.

1483
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,519
He couldn't speak due to
the gunshot wound to his chest,

1484
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,120
but he could move his hand.

1485
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:04,980
Tap, tap, tap-tap.

1486
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:09,080
Tap, tap, tap, tap.

1487
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:12,879
Morse code.

1488
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:16,180
Dot, dot, dot, dot.

1489
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,560
The letter H in Morse Code is four dots.

1490
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:22,679
H is not an initial.

1491
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:24,119
It's a clue.

1492
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:25,519
Four Dots.

1493
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,079
Four Caddies.

1494
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:29,959
Four police staff
in league with organised crime.

1495
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,559
Dot.

1496
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:33,119
Hilton.

1497
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,360
Gill.

1498
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:37,120
Plus one more.

1499
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:39,879
And they're still out there.

1500
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,679
The Deputy Chief Constable
and I are pleased to report

1501
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:48,959
Operation Pear Tree has completed
a thorough investigation

1502
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,999
into institutionalised complicity

1503
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,079
between organised criminals
and corrupt police officers.

1504
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:58,239
Its robust findings couldn't be clearer,

1505
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:01,900
there is no institutionalised
corruption in this police force.

1506
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:05,479
This constabulary will work
tirelessly to root out

1507
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:07,879
rotten apples in its ranks...

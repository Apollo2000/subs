1
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:06,413
It's called Operation Pear Tree.

2
00:00:06,438 --> 00:00:10,660
Our brief was to embed an officer
in an organised crime group.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,440
Detective Sergeant John Corbett.

4
00:00:13,465 --> 00:00:15,675
His files were erased
from the police database,

5
00:00:15,676 --> 00:00:19,406
his phone number and e-mail deleted.
Corbett was given a new identity.

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,284
It's the Eastfield depot.

7
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:26,586
It's where all the police forces in
the region store seized contraband,

8
00:00:26,587 --> 00:00:29,119
drugs, cash, jewels, precious metals.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,160
This could be bigger
than the Brink's-Mat.

10
00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:35,068
There's a strong suggestion women
in that block are being kept

11
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:38,188
in modern-day slavery to
provide sexual services.

12
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:40,228
Our duty is to protect them.

13
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:45,308
And we will raid the house
and raid the print shop.

14
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:46,500
Do it.

15
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:49,029
Christ, how old is she?

16
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:54,949
Who is it, Lise?
Who am I giving all this info to?

17
00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:57,540
H?

18
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:00,748
There's a girl on the unit.
Name's Lisa McQueen.

19
00:01:00,749 --> 00:01:02,508
And she's also the one that makes contact

20
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:04,013
with the higher levels
of the organisation.

21
00:01:04,014 --> 00:01:06,388
- How?
- Laptop.

22
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:08,388
We talk via an audio link.

23
00:01:08,389 --> 00:01:10,908
The replies come up as text.

24
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:12,988
As far as the risk goes,

25
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:16,740
we can minimise that by using
your assets, bent coppers.

26
00:01:19,949 --> 00:01:22,309
The CHIS who's been giving me intel
on the OCG...

27
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:24,789
It's Corbett.

28
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:28,068
He's relayed intelligence
on a planned armed robbery

29
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:29,268
of the Eastfield depot.

30
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:33,700
Eastfield? What's he got backing him
up there, a Panzer division?

31
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:38,388
Detective Chief Superintendent
Hargreaves was pronounced dead

32
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,700
a short while ago.

33
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:44,268
First duty, preservation of life.

34
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:47,668
Divert the AFOs to respond
to the Status Zero.

35
00:01:47,669 --> 00:01:49,028
Hastings?

36
00:01:49,029 --> 00:01:51,548
He pulled you out of there
so we could get away with the gear.

37
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:53,588
He's the one calling all the shots.
He's H.

38
00:01:53,589 --> 00:01:57,109
John Corbett, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Lester Hargreaves.

39
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:01,835
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

40
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,801
- Yeah. I know.
- How much?

41
00:02:03,826 --> 00:02:05,668
Hundred grand.

42
00:02:05,669 --> 00:02:07,948
I don't want the fiasco of
Operation Pear Tree,

43
00:02:07,949 --> 00:02:09,868
which was not of your making,

44
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,828
add a disastrous coda to
an otherwise distinguished career.

45
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:15,589
It's only temporary, obviously.

46
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:25,262
I'm sorry to bother you at such
a late hour, Mrs Hastings.

47
00:02:25,263 --> 00:02:29,220
I'm Detective Sergeant
Steve Arnott, AC-12.

48
00:02:36,669 --> 00:02:37,709
Sir.

49
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:49,268
The doctors say she'll be fine, sir.
She'll make a good recovery.

50
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,109
Thank you, I just need to see my wife.

51
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:58,180
Between us, Mrs Hastings didn't
want your gaffer involved.

52
00:02:58,869 --> 00:03:00,429
That's why it came to us.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

54
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:14,108
All right, love.

55
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:15,149
Ted.

56
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:20,789
Jesus Christ.

57
00:03:25,029 --> 00:03:26,220
Are you in any pain?

58
00:03:27,429 --> 00:03:28,740
Not any more.

59
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,349
They've doped me up to the eyeballs.

60
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:35,709
How did it happen?

61
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:39,860
A man called at the house
saying he was from AC-12,

62
00:03:40,749 --> 00:03:43,940
so of course I told him
I'd better ask you first.

63
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:47,020
Before I could make the phone call,

64
00:03:48,029 --> 00:03:51,789
a man broke in wearing
a balaclava over his face.

65
00:03:54,029 --> 00:03:56,020
You think there were two men?

66
00:03:56,749 --> 00:03:59,460
The man at the door gave
the name Steve Arnott.

67
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:03,508
But you've met Steve Arnott.

68
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,828
I've been through all this
with the other detective...

69
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,268
I know, darling, I know, but...

70
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:10,509
The man that broke in,
I never saw his face...

71
00:04:12,749 --> 00:04:14,149
...and he was from back home.

72
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:18,749
What do you mean?

73
00:04:19,869 --> 00:04:21,029
They haven't told you?

74
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,069
He spoke with a Belfast accent.

75
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,620
He said you'd know why he done it.

76
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,468
He said you'd know what you've cost him.

77
00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:33,988
No, no, no, no. No.

78
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:35,828
No, these people, they're just thugs.

79
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:37,667
You don't believe a word that
comes out of their mouth.

80
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:39,868
They're just trying to
get to me with all this,

81
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:44,028
and trying to stop my team
from beating a path to their door.

82
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:45,828
Who?

83
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:48,068
There's any number of ongoing
inquiries, of course.

84
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:49,828
But you know I'm not
allowed to disclose...

85
00:04:49,829 --> 00:04:51,628
You and your precious regulations.

86
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:56,788
He's only been to my home, only
tortured me and put me in hospital.

87
00:04:56,789 --> 00:04:59,108
I'm sorry, darling. I'm sorry.

88
00:04:59,109 --> 00:05:02,508
If I'd have been there, I'd have
been able to protect you, you see.

89
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:05,589
So now you're trying to make out
it was my fault?

90
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:09,388
- No, no, no...
- If we'd still been together,

91
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:11,271
- this wouldn't have happened?
- Course not!

92
00:05:11,296 --> 00:05:12,740
Is that your game, Ted?

93
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:15,308
No.

94
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:16,500
Get out.

95
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,028
She's in a terrible state.
A terrible state.

96
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:28,908
Look, anything you need for your
investigation, you just ask.

97
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:31,748
- You understand? Just ask.
- Thank you, sir.

98
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:34,348
Given the victim is your wife, sir,
I'm sure you appreciate why

99
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:36,708
Serious Crime needs to
handle this independently.

100
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:39,228
Yeah, well, it's just as well
I'm out of it.

101
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:41,548
Because I can tell you whoever
is responsible for this,

102
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,148
he'd better pray
he's up in front of a judge

103
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:46,100
before I get my hands on him.

104
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:47,988
Sorry, sir.

105
00:05:47,989 --> 00:05:51,468
For my report, any significance
you know of regarding

106
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:55,860
the pattern of injuries to your
wife's wrists, knees and ankles?

107
00:05:56,509 --> 00:05:57,749
No.

108
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:06,149
Cheers, Sam.

109
00:06:07,549 --> 00:06:09,588
Any new leads on Hargreaves?

110
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:11,308
We're working on it.

111
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:13,228
I'm learning the hard way
how people react

112
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:15,588
when they find out
you've had a bent boss,

113
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:17,469
the insinuation you must have known.

114
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:21,069
Ma'am.

115
00:06:21,862 --> 00:06:23,542
Call me, yeah?

116
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:44,868
Sam told us Mrs Hastings claimed

117
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:46,788
her attacker had a Northern Irish accent.

118
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:49,828
And we all know her injuries are classic
paramilitary punishment wounds.

119
00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:52,708
Look, the gaffer's had
the shock of his life.

120
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:55,060
Your family,
that's a whole another level.

121
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:57,988
Let's hope the gaffer opens up,

122
00:06:57,989 --> 00:06:59,949
before we have to start asking.

123
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:09,069
This is Lisa, on with Clayton.

124
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:17,389
About that, yeah.

125
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:23,349
I have my moments.

126
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:30,857
We've just hit a few bumps

127
00:07:30,882 --> 00:07:32,978
trying to fence the
Eastfield gear, that's all.

128
00:07:33,003 --> 00:07:35,308
Yeah, but nothing we
can't get over in time.

129
00:07:35,309 --> 00:07:38,188
But maybe it'd help speed things
along by fencing the gear

130
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:39,460
via other units.

131
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:46,908
We just need a bit of a leg-up,
that's all, you know.

132
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:49,549
That way, we all get to reap the rewards.

133
00:07:57,949 --> 00:07:59,189
Shit.

134
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:03,068
This job, it was meant to make us.

135
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:04,908
- Call him back.
- That's not how this works.

136
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:06,548
Well, you tell me, then, how it works!

137
00:08:06,549 --> 00:08:08,363
What, is he some kind of mind-reader
or what?

138
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:10,948
No. I talk to someone who talks
to someone who talks to someone.

139
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,108
Tell me who,
and I'll get the message through.

140
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:14,652
It's time me and this prick had words.

141
00:08:14,677 --> 00:08:16,228
That's what I'm worried about, mate.

142
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,388
- Why are you protecting him?
- Protecting him?

143
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:20,788
Jesus, John, it ain't that way round.

144
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:23,108
No? Hargreaves crossed us.

145
00:08:23,109 --> 00:08:25,548
So who's he going to have
crossed us to? Hey?

146
00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:27,388
Now we've got one load of coppers
on our tail

147
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:30,548
and another load on a payroll.
Someone's orchestrating all that.

148
00:08:30,549 --> 00:08:33,388
So who do you think's
the best man for the job? Hey?

149
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:36,260
This prick's a copper.
I can feel it in me water.

150
00:08:37,989 --> 00:08:41,748
You're talking shite, John.
You can't know if he's a copper.

151
00:08:41,749 --> 00:08:44,388
I've met enough in my time, more
than enough, more than you, Lise.

152
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:46,948
Look, H is a senior police officer.

153
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:48,429
Tell me I'm wrong.

154
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:55,668
What's happening?

155
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:58,188
We're rounding up officers
identified by semen deposits

156
00:08:58,189 --> 00:09:01,348
that were being kept in cold storage
at the Borogrove Estate brothel.

157
00:09:01,349 --> 00:09:05,348
Some have already confessed to being
blackmailed into assisting the OCG.

158
00:09:05,349 --> 00:09:07,748
One of the semen deposits matched
Hargreaves' DNA.

159
00:09:07,749 --> 00:09:09,260
It was recent as well.

160
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,788
Suggesting the blackmail was also recent?

161
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:13,428
It's looking that way, boss.

162
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:16,308
I've re-interviewed all the officers
known to have assisted the OCG,

163
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:18,188
Jane Cafferty, Kieran Bloom and so on.

164
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:20,388
None of them claim to have
had contact with Hargreaves

165
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:21,948
before a few months ago.

166
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:24,228
There's no way he could have been H.

167
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:26,708
H goes back much further.

168
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:28,348
Sorry, ma'am, is this a bad time?

169
00:09:28,349 --> 00:09:30,308
- No, it's fine. Thanks, Tatleen.
- Ma'am, Sarge,

170
00:09:30,309 --> 00:09:32,708
we've had a breakthrough
at Kingsgate Printing Services.

171
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:34,460
The search of the premises
yielded some findings

172
00:09:34,485 --> 00:09:36,028
we've passed on to Cyber Crime.

173
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:37,640
- Amanda Yao.
- Kate Fleming.

174
00:09:37,665 --> 00:09:38,788
DS Arnott.

175
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:41,628
Corbett relayed intel on a laptop
being used to communicate

176
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:43,468
with the higher levels of the OCG.

177
00:09:43,469 --> 00:09:45,988
Most likely, the laptop accessed
mobile data services

178
00:09:45,989 --> 00:09:47,828
via an encrypted dongle.

179
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:51,588
Unfortunately, that means
we can't access the conversions.

180
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:54,388
Inquiries to service providers
covering that location led to

181
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:57,548
a mobile data account registered
at Kingsgate Printing Services.

182
00:09:57,549 --> 00:09:59,868
We've analysed the account
using various tools

183
00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:02,068
and been able to access the metadata.

184
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:04,188
And tracing the communication
between the device

185
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:07,308
at Kingsgate Printing Services
reveals another user with

186
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:09,548
internet protocol address
located in Spain.

187
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:12,188
That doesn't necessarily mean
the user's in Spain.

188
00:10:12,189 --> 00:10:14,788
Correct. The user could have
concealed their true location,

189
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:16,708
connecting via multiple VPNs.

190
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:18,708
They may be in Spain.
They may be next door.

191
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:20,308
There's no way of knowing.

192
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:22,268
Have you harvested enough
information for us to

193
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:24,388
impersonate the unknown user online?

194
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:27,388
Yes, given time,
we can simulate all the metadata.

195
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:29,948
We'd also need to formulate
some characteristic statements

196
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:33,868
in advance so users on the other end
don't think it's an impersonation.

197
00:10:33,869 --> 00:10:35,708
This would all take a few days.

198
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:37,349
- Do it.
- Yes, ma'am.

199
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:43,708
How is she doing, Ted?
Anything I can do, anything.

200
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,228

We sent some flowers.

204

Oh.

205
00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:56,468
Still, it's a very generous thought,
ma'am. We're very grateful.

206

Poor woman, at her age.

207
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:06,228
I hate to turn the conversation
back to operational concerns

208
00:11:06,229 --> 00:11:09,308
- at a time like this...
- Not at all, ma'am. Not at all.

209
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:11,428
50 million quid's worth of seized goods

210
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:13,108
stolen from a police facility

211
00:11:13,109 --> 00:11:15,988
that was supposed to be
under AC-12 surveillance.

212
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:18,868
Yes. But we did succeed in
apprehending the senior officer

213
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:21,580
who was in cahoots with
the organised crime group,

214
00:11:22,109 --> 00:11:25,188
the head of Serious Crime, no less.
And we will round up

215
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:28,708
his accomplices, Corbett included,
believe you me.

216
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:31,188
There's now a personal dimension
to your inquiry,

217
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:33,268
following the assault on your wife.

218
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:36,868
Indeed, ma'am, but Serious Crime
are handling that investigation.

219
00:11:36,869 --> 00:11:38,380
I am taking no part.

220
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:41,268
The reason they did it, ma'am,
was to pull me away from

221
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:42,508
the bigger inquiry.

222
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:45,868
I would ask you not to give them
the satisfaction.

223
00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:47,788
But it's only natural
people will question

224
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:49,309
how it affects your judgment.

225
00:11:50,989 --> 00:11:54,868
I can vouch for Superintendent
Hastings' personal integrity.

226
00:11:54,869 --> 00:11:59,660
He won't mind me saying no-one's
a bigger stickler for regulations.

227
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:04,220
He's still the best man for the job.

228
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:08,749
Fine.

229
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:12,820
But let me put this
as plainly as possible.

Last chance, Ted.

231
00:12:16,229 --> 00:12:17,380
Clear?

232
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:21,229
Completely, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am.

233

Thank you.

234

We need to cancel those flowers.

Oh, look. Thanks for
backing me up in there, yeah?

Well, what are friends for?

239

Oh, Gill. I can't, I can't, I can't.
I'm sorry.

What's wrong?

241
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:52,629
Well, my wife was attacked exactly
the same time as I was with you.

242
00:12:54,229 --> 00:12:57,389
I mean, if that's not a sign,
I don't know what is.

Uh, look, I'm really sorry.
I haven't had a chance

I'm sorry to hear. Listen, I won't
take up any more of your time.

Just a little more

- All right.
- Just when you get a moment.

You all right, Terry, mate?
How you doing?

We're best mates, aren't we, Terry?

252
00:14:25,109 --> 00:14:27,188
Then how come you never warned us
about the coppers

253
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:29,188
breaking into our print shop?

254
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:31,308
I was scared.

That's why I'm your best mate,
Terry. To protect you.

about the print shop.

Well, if we need a reason
not to tell the gaffer,

379
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:10,748
Corbett never actually admitted
assaulting Roisin.

380
00:22:10,749 --> 00:22:13,868
And he didn't offer any evidence
to back up his allegations either.

Corbett's talked bollocks before.

If the gaffer was having
such massive money problems,

it would have been picked up
by Developed Vetting.

He's done his 30 years.

He could have sailed off into the sunset

We just found out his marriage broke up.

There's all kinds of reasons,
aside of money,

that he might want to stay on.

473
00:27:07,149 --> 00:27:08,189
Do I what?

474
00:27:09,349 --> 00:27:10,389
Like it.

475
00:27:13,149 --> 00:27:17,148
Don't ask yourself that.
It don't lead anywhere helpful.

476
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:19,300
I'm in, that's all.

477
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:21,380
No matter what?

478
00:27:23,749 --> 00:27:25,269
I just do what's expected.

479
00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:32,788
Them two shagging or what?

480
00:27:32,789 --> 00:27:34,940
- How should I know?
- Mm.

481
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:38,788
No. What matters is the Eastfield job.

482
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:40,698
We've got to pull together
to make it pay off.

483
00:27:40,699 --> 00:27:42,708
- "We"?
- You've got to go right to the top.

484
00:27:42,709 --> 00:27:44,303
Only the top man can get enough coppers

485
00:27:44,328 --> 00:27:46,660
looking the other way so
we can move the goods on.

486
00:27:47,629 --> 00:27:49,189
I've already set up a meet.

487
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:53,229
Nice one, Lise. That's just what we need.

488
00:27:57,349 --> 00:27:59,589
[PHONE RINGS]

489
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:04,840
John?

490
00:28:04,865 --> 00:28:07,468
Yeah, it's me, Steph.
I'm OK, love, I'm safe.

491
00:28:07,469 --> 00:28:09,828
Thank God. I've been worried sick.

492
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:12,250
John, they was here again,
them two from anti-corruption.

493
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:13,376
Eh?

494
00:28:15,629 --> 00:28:18,508
I wanted to call you straight after,
but I knew I shouldn't.

495
00:28:18,509 --> 00:28:21,628
That's all right.
You did the right thing.

496
00:28:21,629 --> 00:28:23,548
What did they want?

497
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:24,940
It's scary, John.

498
00:28:25,589 --> 00:28:28,100
They was asking about
Northern Ireland and that.

499
00:28:28,589 --> 00:28:31,028
They was even asking about
family over there.

500
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:34,748
Did they know anything?
Anything of my mum or anything?

501
00:28:34,749 --> 00:28:37,428
- No, nothing.
- So what did you say?

502
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:39,868
You know I'd never say nothing.

503
00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:41,900
It's all right. I know you wouldn't.

504
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:48,180
What's this all about?

505
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,708
Do they know about Anne-Marie?

506
00:28:51,709 --> 00:28:54,189
No. You know I can't talk about the job.

507
00:28:55,829 --> 00:28:57,189
John, what's wrong?

508
00:29:00,829 --> 00:29:02,315
John?

509
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,548
I'm... I'm just missing you...

510
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:07,509
I'm just missing you
and the girls loads, that's all.

511
00:29:09,389 --> 00:29:11,309
We're missing you loads an' all.

512
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,189
I can't wait for this job to be done
and I can come home.

513
00:29:31,989 --> 00:29:34,108
- Sir.
- Sir.

514
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:35,460
Right.

515
00:29:36,349 --> 00:29:39,348
So, what have we got?

516
00:29:39,349 --> 00:29:41,748
We've had a breakthrough,
thanks to our Cyber Crime team.

517
00:29:41,749 --> 00:29:43,948
Corbett's been communicating
with the command level

518
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,988
of the organised crime group
via a computer link.

519
00:29:45,989 --> 00:29:48,188
- Great. Have we traced the link?
- Not conclusively, sir,

520
00:29:48,189 --> 00:29:50,468
but we're aiming to be in a position
to simulate it.

521
00:29:50,469 --> 00:29:52,788
That'll enable us to exploit
Corbett's desire to fence

522
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:54,448
the seized goods by luring him
to a meeting.

523
00:29:54,449 --> 00:29:56,121
- Good.
- We've got targeted surveillance

524
00:29:56,146 --> 00:29:58,868
in place at Corbett's
family home on Merseyside.

525
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:01,508
Last night, an incoming call
was made by a burner phone that

526
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:04,468
we've triangulated to premises
in the Edge Park area,

527
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,828
a development of apartments,

528
00:30:05,829 --> 00:30:07,988
one of which may be Corbett's
covert residence.

529
00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:10,500
Great. We've got his location.
We've got him.

530
00:30:11,429 --> 00:30:14,668
Sir, Corbett's crossed a line,
nobody's arguing he hasn't,

531
00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:18,148
but he's also our best chance of
apprehending other corrupt officers.

532
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,508
Corbett's convinced he's in contact
with the top man.

533
00:30:20,509 --> 00:30:21,908
Yeah, well, that's as may be, son,

534
00:30:21,909 --> 00:30:24,188
but we cannot have him out there
for another day longer.

535
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:26,188
What if he commits another crime?

536
00:30:26,189 --> 00:30:28,748
What if, God forbid,
he takes another life?

537
00:30:28,749 --> 00:30:32,948
Sir, there is a threat-to-life risk
if Corbett won't come quietly.

538
00:30:32,949 --> 00:30:34,500
Well, that's his lookout.

539
00:30:37,229 --> 00:30:38,308
Thank you.

540
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:39,429
- Sir.
- Sir.

541
00:31:13,109 --> 00:31:16,708
I'll do everything I can to make him
give himself up peacefully.

542
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:19,868
No, no, son. You hang on to that.

543
00:31:19,869 --> 00:31:21,680
We're not going to take any chances here.

544
00:31:21,705 --> 00:31:22,813
Sir.

545
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:26,389
It won't come to that.

546

Standing by for confirmation of ID.

547

Received, 2-5.
TFC, visual. Confirming target ID.

548
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:55,620
Heading west on Harnest Street.
TFC, do you copy, 6-4?

549
00:31:56,589 --> 00:31:58,220
6-4, standing by.

550
00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:07,948
TFC, 4-5 clear to approach.

551
00:32:07,949 --> 00:32:09,749
4-5, received.

552
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:27,189
John.

553
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:29,940
Well...

554
00:32:30,469 --> 00:32:32,908
Guess I underestimated
your powers of detection.

555
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:36,628
You know why I'm here, mate. Let's
bring an end to this whole thing.

556
00:32:36,629 --> 00:32:39,108
- Listen to me, John...
- No, you listen to me.

557
00:32:39,109 --> 00:32:42,780
It's on for today. The top man,
I'm meeting him.

558
00:32:43,229 --> 00:32:46,988
Look, this is it, Steve. The bent
copper pulling all the strings,

559
00:32:46,989 --> 00:32:48,388
you know, and not just the top man.

560
00:32:48,389 --> 00:32:50,748
Lisa McQueen, she's going to turn.
I'm sure of it.

561
00:32:50,749 --> 00:32:54,708
And she's got contacts going back
years, the whole organisation.

562
00:32:54,709 --> 00:32:57,940
You nick me now and we'll never
get this chance again.

563
00:32:58,829 --> 00:33:02,188
4-5, this is 1-0. Apprehend the subject.

564
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:03,340
Right now!

565
00:33:05,229 --> 00:33:06,988
Where's the meeting taking place?

566
00:33:06,989 --> 00:33:08,908
No. No way. I know your game.

567
00:33:08,909 --> 00:33:10,988
I give you that,
and this gets taken out my hands.

568
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,028
And you know why I can't let that happen.

569
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:15,108
This corrupt network
goes right to the top.

570
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:17,388
And today, I'll prove how close to home.

571
00:33:17,389 --> 00:33:19,388
Come and work with us, not against us.

572
00:33:19,389 --> 00:33:21,228
Is that the best you can come up with?

573
00:33:21,229 --> 00:33:22,708
I assaulted your gaffer's wife.

574
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,340
He'll make sure I go down.
There's no two ways about it.

575
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:27,109
Mother of God.

576
00:33:28,709 --> 00:33:31,668
Let's work together, John.
We want the same thing.

577
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:33,668
I believe you, mate. I honestly do.

578
00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:36,548
But only one of us is prepared
to go the distance on this job.

579
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:39,588
You've got blind loyalty, which stops
you seeing what's plain as day,

580
00:33:39,589 --> 00:33:41,748
the person this trail leads to.

581
00:33:41,749 --> 00:33:45,948
1-0. 4-5, apprehend the subject at once.

582
00:33:45,949 --> 00:33:48,748
Sir, is it not worth letting
this play out another 24 hours?

583
00:33:48,749 --> 00:33:51,708
Look, Kate, we do not trust
Corbett one inch.

584
00:33:51,709 --> 00:33:54,668
He's already battered a defenceless
woman in her own home.

585
00:33:54,669 --> 00:33:56,628
For Chrissake, Kate!
What are you waiting for?

586
00:33:56,629 --> 00:33:58,708
Sir. TFC.

587
00:33:58,709 --> 00:34:00,949
4-5, arrest the subject.

588
00:34:02,869 --> 00:34:04,868
DS Arnott, you're in receipt
of a lawful order

589
00:34:04,869 --> 00:34:08,148
from a commanding officer.
You will carry it out at once.

590
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:11,308
John, I need you to accompany me
to AC-12...

591
00:34:11,309 --> 00:34:14,669
You need you to back off
and let me finish this job!

592
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:19,740
DS John Corbett, you're under arrest.

593
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:23,748
Snipers, maintain cover.
6-4, prepare to move forward.

594
00:34:23,749 --> 00:34:25,508
Yeah. Sure I am.

595
00:34:25,509 --> 00:34:27,108
John.

596
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:28,349
John!

597
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:35,748
7-5, target blocked,
no visual on subject.

598
00:34:35,749 --> 00:34:38,148
4-5, 1-0. Active message.

599
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:39,389
Critical shot blocked.

600
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:41,860
Put the gun down.

601
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:44,660
John, put the gun down.

602
00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:50,300
1-0 to 4-5. The order is Fahrenheit.

603
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:52,708
Sir, we'll lose all of Corbett's intel.

604
00:34:52,709 --> 00:34:56,268
Lethal force is authorised where
there's an immediate threat to life.

605
00:34:56,269 --> 00:34:59,180
We know that Corbett is
a cold-blooded killer.

606
00:34:59,949 --> 00:35:01,748
The order is Fahrenheit.

607
00:35:01,749 --> 00:35:03,108
Give yourself up.

608
00:35:03,109 --> 00:35:05,868
Repeat, the order is Fahrenheit.

609
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:07,340
Give yourself up!

610
00:35:09,189 --> 00:35:12,460
You shoot me and the truth
never comes out.

611
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:18,108
What kind of copper are you, eh?

612
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:21,069
One who cares about orders,
or one who cares about justice?

613
00:35:29,029 --> 00:35:30,340
You wearing a wire?

614
00:35:31,189 --> 00:35:32,429
Yeah.

615
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,300
Take it out.

616
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:37,020
And I'll tell you the where and when
for this meeting.

617
00:35:37,629 --> 00:35:40,100
Steve, do not comply. That's an order.

618
00:35:45,749 --> 00:35:48,349
- [FEEDBACK CRACKLES]
- What the hell is he playing at?

619
00:35:53,869 --> 00:35:56,948
- Shit!
- The wee gobshite.

620
00:35:56,949 --> 00:35:58,884
Get the AFOs down there on the double!

621
00:35:58,885 --> 00:36:01,189
Sir. 6-4, move in urgently.

622
00:36:05,189 --> 00:36:07,148
The Palisades, the shopping centre.

623
00:36:07,149 --> 00:36:08,988
This afternoon, four o'clock.

624
00:36:08,989 --> 00:36:10,628
Be careful who you tell.

625
00:36:10,629 --> 00:36:13,469
Because if it doesn't happen,
you know you've got a leak.

626
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:19,260
Thanks, mate.

627
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:24,868
OFFICER: 6-4, not yet visual
with target. ETA ten seconds.

628
00:36:24,869 --> 00:36:26,309
TFC, received.

629
00:36:30,029 --> 00:36:31,269
Where is he?

630
00:36:37,149 --> 00:36:38,749
- Anyone see him?
- Shit.

631
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:42,148
Where'd he go?

632
00:36:42,149 --> 00:36:44,548
A thorough search of the location
detected a service door

633
00:36:44,549 --> 00:36:46,948
in the passageway where the target
was last observed.

634
00:36:46,949 --> 00:36:50,268
The service corridor leads
to an underground car park.

635
00:36:50,269 --> 00:36:55,148
CCTV captured the subject making his
escape via the underground car park.

636
00:36:55,149 --> 00:36:57,828
There's a locked service door
which opens out onto the far side

637
00:36:57,829 --> 00:37:01,108
of the apartment block,
which we didn't have covered.

638
00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:03,948
By the time my team got round
the back, he was long gone.

639
00:37:03,949 --> 00:37:06,641
I'm very sorry, sir. OK. Thank you, Kyle.

640
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:07,920
Sir.

641
00:37:14,789 --> 00:37:17,628
As a UCO, he will have identified
all the escape routes

642
00:37:17,629 --> 00:37:19,388
at his residence.

643
00:37:19,389 --> 00:37:21,508
The service door was locked.

644
00:37:21,509 --> 00:37:24,842
Probably he found a means
of acquiring the key codes.

645
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,108
Yeah.

646
00:37:26,109 --> 00:37:27,428
On the plus side, sir,

647
00:37:27,429 --> 00:37:30,348
we have been able to identify
Corbett's apartment.

648
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:32,709
Search team and forensics
have been deployed.

649
00:37:36,229 --> 00:37:37,269
Good.

650
00:37:40,869 --> 00:37:43,468
I think I've let him stew
long enough, don't you?

651
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:48,388
Sir, I'd appreciate your guidance
on my report for the SFC.

652
00:37:48,389 --> 00:37:52,500
- Your Fahrenheit order was irregular.
- Now listen...

653
00:37:52,909 --> 00:37:56,468
The SFC authorised the use of firearms

654
00:37:56,469 --> 00:37:58,068
for this morning's operation.

655
00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:02,428
The suspect was a known armed
criminal with a history of violence

656
00:38:02,429 --> 00:38:05,388
who was an immediate and credible
threat to the public.

657
00:38:05,389 --> 00:38:10,588
Therefore, lethal force is justified
according to Common Law Section 3

658
00:38:10,589 --> 00:38:13,268
of the Criminal Law Act of 1967

659
00:38:13,269 --> 00:38:18,548
and Section 117 of the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act of 1984.

660
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:22,120
Now, are we're done dotting the
I's and crossing the t's here?

661
00:38:22,145 --> 00:38:23,258
Sir.

662
00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:28,034
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I am fine, Kate. I'm fine.

663
00:38:28,035 --> 00:38:31,028
It's just now Corbett's confessed
to assaulting your wife...

664
00:38:31,029 --> 00:38:34,508
Look, the guy is responsible
for killing five police officers,

665
00:38:34,509 --> 00:38:35,868
Maneet Bindra being one of them.

666
00:38:35,869 --> 00:38:39,349
This is the monster we're dealing
with. For Chrissake, Kate!

667
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:57,749
Remain standing.

668
00:39:03,429 --> 00:39:05,445
Sir, can we do this
somewhere more private?

669
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,268
Absolutely not.

670
00:39:07,269 --> 00:39:08,629
I'll hear your report.

671
00:39:12,189 --> 00:39:14,480
My operational assessment was
that Corbett had acquired

672
00:39:14,505 --> 00:39:17,828
high-value intelligence which
overrode the necessity for arrest.

673
00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:20,868
My order was clear and lawful.

674
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:22,740
I'm not an assassin.

675
00:39:23,269 --> 00:39:25,548
If loss of life can be avoided,
it should be avoided.

676
00:39:25,549 --> 00:39:29,508
And with respect, sir, I'd dispute
the lawfulness of your order.

677
00:39:29,509 --> 00:39:31,588
You'd just learned Corbett
had been responsible

678
00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:32,988
for a vicious attack on your wife.

679
00:39:32,989 --> 00:39:37,789
What was the intelligence
that Corbett divulged?

680
00:39:41,709 --> 00:39:44,788
Was that intelligence relating
to the senior police officer

681
00:39:44,789 --> 00:39:47,620
complicit with the OCG? Am I right?

682
00:39:48,149 --> 00:39:54,149
Or person or persons who were at the
end of that computer link, yes?

683
00:39:55,589 --> 00:39:56,669
Yes?

684
00:39:58,309 --> 00:40:00,940
- Yes.
- So what was the intelligence?

685
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,068
Corbett advised me
to limit my disclosure,

686
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,740
as he fears there may be a leak.

687
00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:13,068
Well, I am looking round this room,
son, and I can only see me and you,

688
00:40:13,069 --> 00:40:16,540
so I do not know where this leak
is going to come from!

689
00:40:19,909 --> 00:40:24,500
You're skating on thin ice with me,
DS Arnott. Wafer thin.

690
00:40:26,069 --> 00:40:29,460
So what was the bloody intelligence, son?

691
00:40:35,229 --> 00:40:39,028
A meeting at 4pm today
between the OCG and the top man.

692
00:40:39,029 --> 00:40:40,389
Palisades shopping mall.

693
00:40:42,069 --> 00:40:43,109
Thank you.

694
00:40:44,629 --> 00:40:45,669
As you were.

695
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:51,509
What's the time?

696
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:54,709
He hasn't shown up.

697
00:41:56,002 --> 00:41:57,162
For Chrissake!

698
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:03,180
Corbett's leaving.

699
00:42:04,029 --> 00:42:06,188
Looks like it's going to be a no-show.

700
00:42:06,189 --> 00:42:07,229
Shit!

701
00:42:18,429 --> 00:42:21,268
3-7, 6-4, priority message.

702
00:42:21,269 --> 00:42:22,708
3-7.

703
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:24,948
Ma'am, we believe the suspects are armed.

704
00:42:24,949 --> 00:42:26,948
I'm concerned about the risk assessment,

705
00:42:26,949 --> 00:42:29,789
who are threat to members of the public
if we go in.

706
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:32,948
Stand by.

707
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:33,989
We can't risk it.

708
00:42:36,709 --> 00:42:39,428
3-7, 6-4, risk assessment's negative.

709
00:42:39,429 --> 00:42:42,548
Do not approach. Repeat, do not approach.

710
00:42:42,549 --> 00:42:43,589
Received.

711
00:42:45,909 --> 00:42:46,949
Shit.

712
00:42:48,469 --> 00:42:51,148
Sierra Zulu 3-5.

713
00:42:51,149 --> 00:42:52,189
Stand down.

714
00:42:55,189 --> 00:42:56,229
Stand down.

715
00:43:12,869 --> 00:43:14,789
- How'd it go?
- Don't ask.

716
00:43:32,189 --> 00:43:34,428
- [KNOCK ON DOOR]
- Yeah.

717
00:43:34,429 --> 00:43:36,988
Sit rep from the Palisades
surveillance, sir.

718
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,668
They're saying H is a no-show.

719
00:43:38,669 --> 00:43:40,748
- Damn. Any arrests?
- No.

720
00:43:40,749 --> 00:43:43,588
They reported too many members
of the public at risk.

721
00:43:43,589 --> 00:43:45,740
- Chrissake!
- Sorry, sir.

722
00:44:06,709 --> 00:44:08,300
Lee Banks?

723
00:44:09,069 --> 00:44:10,548
Who the hell are you?

724
00:44:10,549 --> 00:44:12,340
Superintendent Hastings.

725
00:44:12,909 --> 00:44:16,269
My department,
we're the ones who put you inside.

726
00:44:18,029 --> 00:44:20,668
I ain't saying a word to this bastard.

727
00:44:20,669 --> 00:44:22,020
Sit down, fella.

728
00:44:24,429 --> 00:44:27,140
This bastard's got a thing or two
to say to you.

729
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:33,020
Trust me, you'll be glad you did.

730
00:45:15,029 --> 00:45:16,388
- Sarge.
- Yeah?

731
00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:18,548
Forensics were able to detect
DNA and fingerprints

732
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,829
at Corbett's apartment.

733
00:45:21,709 --> 00:45:22,740
Great.

734
00:45:23,549 --> 00:45:24,788
Boss...

735
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:26,269
We've got Corbett's prints.

736
00:45:32,549 --> 00:45:35,188
As you've both deduced, like
everyone else joining the police,

737
00:45:35,189 --> 00:45:37,028
Corbett had to provide elimination prints

738
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:39,388
to exclude crime scene contamination.

739
00:45:39,389 --> 00:45:41,668
These haven't been erased from
the IDENT1 system,

740
00:45:41,669 --> 00:45:44,108
which gives us access to
identity records he submitted

741
00:45:44,109 --> 00:45:47,788
when he first joined the force in 1999.

742
00:45:47,789 --> 00:45:50,188
John Corbett is the name he was
given when he was adopted

743
00:45:50,189 --> 00:45:54,468
by the Corbett family in 1989
at the age of ten.

744
00:45:54,469 --> 00:45:57,188
His adoptive mother's
maiden name was McGillis.

745
00:45:57,189 --> 00:45:58,708
I believe she was a close relative,

746
00:45:58,709 --> 00:46:01,228
as Corbett's birth name
was John McGillis.

747
00:46:01,229 --> 00:46:02,589
He was born in Belfast.

748
00:46:03,709 --> 00:46:08,068
His father was Anthony Patrick
McGillis, deceased 1984.

749
00:46:08,069 --> 00:46:11,860
And his mother, Anne-Marie
McGillis, deceased 1989.

750
00:46:12,389 --> 00:46:15,348
Hence Corbett's move to Liverpool
and the adoption.

751
00:46:15,349 --> 00:46:16,389
Good work.

752
00:46:17,469 --> 00:46:19,548
This is completely confidential.

753
00:46:19,549 --> 00:46:22,988
You don't discuss with anybody
except myself and DS Arnott.

754
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:25,668
Find out as much as you can
on the McGillis family,

755
00:46:25,669 --> 00:46:27,469
- however long it takes.
- Ma'am.

756
00:46:52,589 --> 00:46:54,029
We've got contact.

757
00:46:55,029 --> 00:46:57,748
It doesn't normally happen this way.

758
00:46:57,749 --> 00:46:59,508
What are you saying?

759
00:46:59,509 --> 00:47:00,989
I'm saying let's be careful.

760
00:47:02,549 --> 00:47:05,949
Things are getting, erm, strained.

761
00:47:32,109 --> 00:47:33,429
We're both here now.

762
00:47:35,149 --> 00:47:36,548
Can you hear us?

763
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:38,229
It's him. It's Corbett.

764
00:47:45,709 --> 00:47:47,780
Is that why you didn't make the meeting?

765
00:47:48,349 --> 00:47:49,620
Did you get a tip-off?

766
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,220
Are you going to acknowledge
that the meeting was arranged?

767
00:48:02,029 --> 00:48:04,668
It's one of the pre-composed
responses we've constructed

768
00:48:04,669 --> 00:48:06,988
to convince them they're talking
to the right person.

769
00:48:06,989 --> 00:48:08,828
Yeah. OK. Come on. Get up.

770
00:48:08,829 --> 00:48:11,148
That's it. Up, up, up. Thank you.

771
00:48:11,149 --> 00:48:12,668
You're making a meal of this.

772
00:48:12,669 --> 00:48:14,948
We all know what Corbett wants.

773
00:48:14,949 --> 00:48:17,108
So let's just cut to the chase, shall we?

774
00:48:17,109 --> 00:48:18,460
Sir, are you sure?

775
00:48:28,789 --> 00:48:29,829
Yeah, definitely.

776
00:48:30,869 --> 00:48:32,149
Are you proposing a plan?

777
00:48:33,509 --> 00:48:34,549
Yep.

778
00:48:45,269 --> 00:48:47,349
Well, that'd be great, if it's possible.

779
00:49:13,949 --> 00:49:14,989
OK.

780
00:49:33,869 --> 00:49:34,909
What do you mean?

781
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:37,429
What do I mean?

782
00:50:03,669 --> 00:50:04,900
OK, ladies.

783
00:50:10,269 --> 00:50:11,908
We need to make a stop here.

784
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:14,548
It's a good place to make sure
everyone's documents are in order

1
00:00:02,441 --> 00:00:04,601
Before Danny died, he tried to
say something.

2
00:00:04,636 --> 00:00:06,592
Now I reckon what he said was,
"List. "

3
00:00:06,601 --> 00:00:08,841
What was Danny on to that meant
you had to kill him?

4
00:00:11,501 --> 00:00:14,261
The final report states that these
findings are consistent with

5
00:00:14,296 --> 00:00:15,706
a blood stained note.

6
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:18,111
And this is just between us for now?

7
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:26,671
I'm innocent.
The question is, are you?

8
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:29,476
You lied in court.

9
00:00:29,511 --> 00:00:32,151
You lied to your partner
and you lied to me!

10
00:00:32,186 --> 00:00:33,791
I did not plant evidence.

11
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:38,348
We gather the evidence
and the people decide.

12
00:00:38,373 --> 00:00:40,431
They've decided that she
didn't do it because you

13
00:00:40,466 --> 00:00:42,836
couldn't keep it in your pants.
That's not what happened.

14
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:46,031
There's seconds here, if you fancy?
Any more and I won't get off this sofa.

15
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:53,991
I had intended that meeting in
a more social setting

16
00:00:54,026 --> 00:00:56,951
would make this less confrontational
between us...

17
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:02,511
I'm a married man.

18
00:01:02,546 --> 00:01:04,516
Separated.

19
00:01:04,551 --> 00:01:06,111
I'm sorry, Gill.

20
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:11,276
Oliver Stephens-Lloyd,

21
00:01:11,311 --> 00:01:14,351
a registered social worker with
responsibility at Sands View.

22
00:01:14,386 --> 00:01:17,391
Chief Superintendent Fairbank had
nothing to do with this case.

23
00:01:17,426 --> 00:01:18,711
He ran Vice.

24
00:01:22,271 --> 00:01:25,191
Stephens-Lloyd claimed he compiled
a list of authority figures who

25
00:01:25,226 --> 00:01:28,391
conducted systematic abuse of boys
resident at Sands View.

26
00:01:28,426 --> 00:01:31,351
See, I've never even heard of this
Stands View place.

27
00:01:31,386 --> 00:01:33,196
I hope I'm not too late.

28
00:01:33,231 --> 00:01:36,071
I saw the handshake at the door.

29
00:01:36,106 --> 00:01:37,351
It was masonic.

30
00:01:43,031 --> 00:01:45,956
I'm putting you in for
a commendation.

31
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:49,591
Ronan Murphy was interviewed about the
conspiracy Lindsay Denton was convicted of?

32
00:01:49,626 --> 00:01:51,568
None of this was in the file.

33
00:01:51,603 --> 00:01:53,511
And who gave us that file?

34
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:54,831
Hastings.

35
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:02,551
The Caddy is male, under 35.
A Detective.

36
00:02:02,586 --> 00:02:05,631
A London or South East accent.

37
00:02:08,391 --> 00:02:11,951
I'm sorry, gaffer, but the finger's
pointing at one of our own.

38
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:19,831
Detective Inspector Matthew Cottan
has distinguished not only himself

39
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:22,791
but the entire anti-corruption
division.

40
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:24,991
Detective Inspector Matthew Cottan.

41
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:32,351
It is an honour to present DI Cottan
with this award for Outstanding Bravery.

42
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:33,796
The commendation reads -

43
00:02:33,831 --> 00:02:37,151
"In recognition of courageous
conduct in apprehending a dangerous

44
00:02:37,186 --> 00:02:40,471
"suspect with commendable disregard
for your own personal safety. "

45
00:02:40,506 --> 00:02:42,671
Well done, Cottan.
Thank you, sir.

47
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:10,231
Congratulations, Matthew.
Ah, thanks, Gill.

48
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:11,768
You need a drink.

49
00:03:11,803 --> 00:03:13,437
There you go.

50
00:03:13,472 --> 00:03:15,071
Cheers. Cheers.

51
00:03:16,231 --> 00:03:19,511
Have you thought about going
in front of the DCI promotion board?

52
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:35,876
Right. Coffee?
Yeah, lovely.

53
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:37,911
Don't be going to any trouble
on my account.

54
00:03:37,946 --> 00:03:39,608
You know, I'll have instant.

55
00:03:39,643 --> 00:03:41,271
Special occasion, though.

56
00:03:43,111 --> 00:03:45,591
Actually, it's good to be able to
talk outside the office.

57
00:03:47,271 --> 00:03:48,751
Is everything OK?

58
00:03:51,271 --> 00:03:52,911
No. Not really.

59
00:03:55,071 --> 00:03:57,671
Steve's been ordering more
forensics on evidence seized

60
00:03:57,706 --> 00:04:00,071
from Danny Waldron's flat.

61
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,276
Why?

62
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:03,356
He'll be making out I missed a lead,

63
00:04:03,391 --> 00:04:06,791
but I know what he's up to.
That's classic classroom tactics.

64
00:04:06,826 --> 00:04:10,191
If you've farted, you hold your
nose, you point at someone else.

65
00:04:10,226 --> 00:04:11,671
What do you mean?

66
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:14,951
He's hiding summat.

67
00:04:14,986 --> 00:04:16,276
What?

68
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:19,196
I shouldn't say until
there's evidence.

69
00:04:19,231 --> 00:04:23,471
I hope I'm wrong, I really do,
but if I'm not...

70
00:04:25,711 --> 00:04:28,591
.. I need to know you've got my back?

71
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:30,196
God, yeah.

72
00:04:30,231 --> 00:04:32,631
Look, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
really said anything.

73
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,111
I know you two go back a-ways.
No, you had to.

74
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:47,191
Glock 17.

75
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:52,711
Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

76
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:55,228
I will fear no evil

77
00:04:55,263 --> 00:04:57,676
for you are with me.

78
00:04:57,711 --> 00:05:00,151
Your rod and staff, they comfort me.

79
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:04,591
We now commit Daniel's
body to the ground.

80
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:11,111
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust...

81
00:05:12,951 --> 00:05:18,191
.. in the sure and certain hope of
the resurrection to eternal life.

82
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:10,431
Is there a problem, sir?

83
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:11,596
Why do you ask?

84
00:06:11,631 --> 00:06:13,472
I know there was a
briefing - inspectors and

85
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:15,191
above - and no-one's
letting me in on it.

86
00:06:15,226 --> 00:06:17,231
Hence "inspectors and above".

87
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:23,031
So, what's that about then?

88
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:26,756
I went to Danny Waldron's funeral.

89
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,911
There's still a perceived threat to
anyone associated with Danny.

90
00:06:29,946 --> 00:06:31,671
And was anyone there?

91
00:06:32,951 --> 00:06:34,476
No. No.

92
00:06:34,511 --> 00:06:36,556
Well, that's good to know, eh?

93
00:06:36,591 --> 00:06:39,351
And you shouldn't be bringing that
round here.

94
00:06:39,386 --> 00:06:41,271
This isn't the Bronx.

95
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:51,316
Feeling better?

96
00:06:51,351 --> 00:06:53,756
Uh, yeah, thanks.
Just a stomach bug.

97
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,871
Yeah. Well, now you're back, I was
hoping to get

98
00:06:55,906 --> 00:06:59,191
those additional forensics
I requested.

99
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:01,116
What's the hold-up?

100
00:07:01,151 --> 00:07:03,711
I don't want to get caught between
you and DI Cottan.

101
00:07:03,746 --> 00:07:05,231
What d'you mean?

102
00:07:12,751 --> 00:07:15,671
He knew forensics hadn't bothered
testing the envelope?

103
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,391
I'll be right back.

104
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:25,076
17.

105
00:08:25,111 --> 00:08:28,111
Serial number and number and
type of rounds.

106
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:36,111
Cheers.

107
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:42,591
G36 carbine, plus rounds.

108
00:08:46,231 --> 00:08:48,111
You wanted me to see something?

109
00:08:48,146 --> 00:08:49,996
Yeah.

110
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:54,951
I've been reviewing CCTV of Danny Waldron
from the murder timeline of Linus Murphy.

111
00:08:56,031 --> 00:08:58,731
Here's Danny arriving.
Note the direction of travel.

112
00:08:58,766 --> 00:09:01,396
It matches the route from Linus
Murphy's residence,

113
00:09:01,431 --> 00:09:04,991
so we have to assume Danny's come
directly from killing Linus.

114
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:08,316
Formal ID, it's Danny Waldron.

115
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,591
These images tally with the paperwork
we got from the storage facility...

116
00:09:13,311 --> 00:09:15,751
.. and our assumption is that the
rucksack contains

117
00:09:15,786 --> 00:09:18,156
Linus Murphy's head wrapped in
a watertight bin liner

118
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:21,271
and the carrier bag must be a
cold-storage container he bought en route.

119
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:27,076
Now the rucksack's empty -

120
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:29,871
presumably after Danny's stored
Linus's head.

121
00:09:30,951 --> 00:09:35,831
He leaves and we pick him up
on an exterior camera again.

122
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,196
Danny jogging away.

123
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:40,511
Note the different direction
of travel from his arrival.

124
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,791
I just want to get the job done,
Kate,

125
00:09:47,826 --> 00:09:50,031
and we've always done a good
one together.

126
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:51,831
The job, that I can do.

127
00:09:53,271 --> 00:09:55,076
Where do you think he's going?

128
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:58,191
Unfortunately there's no other
CCTV of Danny. But...

129
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:04,316
.. here's the storage facility,

130
00:10:04,351 --> 00:10:06,911
here's the direction we see him
leaving.

131
00:10:06,946 --> 00:10:08,871
Danny's flat is located here.

132
00:10:10,271 --> 00:10:13,196
It appears he came directly from
Linus Murphy's place,

133
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:16,031
so his only opportunity to conceal
any information he obtained

134
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:18,191
from Linus was when he
was in his flat.

135
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:19,631
What information?

136
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:30,791
Ink and blood was detected on the inside of
an envelope found at Danny Waldron's flat.

137
00:10:30,826 --> 00:10:33,316
Now, the blood matches to
Linus Murphy.

138
00:10:33,351 --> 00:10:35,516
To me, that means he must have
written a message

139
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,991
and put it in the envelope
straight from killing Murphy,

140
00:10:38,026 --> 00:10:39,631
even before he washed the blood off.

141
00:10:40,751 --> 00:10:44,311
It was definitely there in that
envelope. For a time, at least.

142
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,871
Why are we only getting this
information now?

143
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:53,031
Admin cockup. Forensics' fault.

144
00:10:56,911 --> 00:10:58,311
OK.

145
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,436
All right? Where you off to?

146
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:07,151
Morrison's over the road,
but don't tell no-one.

147
00:11:07,186 --> 00:11:09,191
I'll keep quiet for a Kit-Kat.

148
00:11:14,111 --> 00:11:17,271
Any surveillance has to be
authorised by Superintendent-rank

149
00:11:17,306 --> 00:11:20,968
or above and meet the RIPA criteria.
It's not rocket science...

150
00:11:21,003 --> 00:11:24,917
Matthew... Anyway, get back to me
if there's a problem. Will do.

151
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:28,831
Hope you're not still hungover
from all that taxpayers' champagne.

152
00:11:30,071 --> 00:11:31,831
Have you got a minute? Yeah.

153
00:11:34,071 --> 00:11:38,551
Look, I am the last person to go
behind anyone's back,

154
00:11:38,586 --> 00:11:40,631
but I've raised concerns about
a colleague

155
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,396
with my commanding officer...

156
00:11:42,431 --> 00:11:45,311
Well, if Ted's dealing with it,
I shouldn't really get involved.

157
00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:47,991
That's the problem. He's not.

158
00:11:48,026 --> 00:11:49,476
Oh.

159
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:51,556
I can guess who the colleague
might be.

160
00:11:51,591 --> 00:11:56,111
What worries me is he's wandering
around this place with a firearm.

161
00:11:56,146 --> 00:11:57,951
Oh, my God.

162
00:11:57,986 --> 00:11:59,796
Sorry.

163
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:01,511
Look, maybe I shouldn't have...

164
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:04,471
No, leave it with me.

165
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:06,151
Thanks, Gill.

166
00:12:17,751 --> 00:12:20,356
Got a lead on Fairbank.

167
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:23,191
Digging into his personnel records,
there was a complaint made

168
00:12:23,226 --> 00:12:25,516
by someone called Wendy Rider.

169
00:12:25,551 --> 00:12:27,991
The complaint wasn't pursued
because Fairbank retired.

170
00:12:28,026 --> 00:12:29,676
What was the complaint?

171
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:32,671
Well, as usual where Chief
Superintendent Fairbank's concerned,

172
00:12:32,706 --> 00:12:34,991
the records are sketchy, to say the
least.

173
00:12:35,026 --> 00:12:36,556
But it was about her son.

174
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:39,596
He was a resident at
Sands View Boys' Home.

175
00:12:39,631 --> 00:12:43,351
He's overseas with the Army now,
but she still lives in the area.

176
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:46,231
Nice work.

177
00:12:47,471 --> 00:12:49,031
Just doing my job, mate.

178
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:55,591
Do you remember when he went to
Sands View and how long he was there?

179
00:12:55,626 --> 00:13:00,156
He was 13. It was nearly
a year till he come out.

180
00:13:00,191 --> 00:13:03,031
It'd help our inquiry if you could
tell us why you made a complaint

181
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:05,968
about a Chief Superintendent named
Patrick Fairbank.

182
00:13:06,003 --> 00:13:08,836
Well, Greg would never talk about
what had happened.

183
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,951
We never talked much anyway
after he got took away from me.

184
00:13:12,986 --> 00:13:15,271
He blamed me for what had happened.

185
00:13:15,306 --> 00:13:16,831
What had happened?

186
00:13:18,671 --> 00:13:20,871
He said he'd been...

187
00:13:20,906 --> 00:13:23,036
interfered with.

188
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:27,076
A big fat bloke, he said.
So I went to the police.

189
00:13:27,111 --> 00:13:31,756
They didn't want to know. They said
Greg wasn't a reliable witness.

190
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,211
So I told them, if they
didn't do nothing, I was

191
00:13:34,236 --> 00:13:36,631
going to write to the
papers and my MP and that.

192
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,031
They just laughed in my face.

193
00:13:39,066 --> 00:13:41,271
And that was that?

194
00:13:41,306 --> 00:13:42,596
No.

195
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:45,782
A week after, one of
them come round and said

196
00:13:45,807 --> 00:13:48,615
this Chief Superintendent
had sorted it.

197
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:52,351
Who came round? A uniformed officer?

198
00:13:52,386 --> 00:13:53,836
Yeah.

199
00:13:53,871 --> 00:13:57,676
He said the Chief Superintendent had
got the bloke to confess

200
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,740
and that it was all all
right so that Greg

201
00:13:59,765 --> 00:14:01,911
wouldn't have to go
through a trial and that.

202
00:14:01,946 --> 00:14:03,996
To be clear, Mrs Rider -

203
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,671
you were advised that the offender
was going to prison?

204
00:14:06,706 --> 00:14:07,916
Yeah.

205
00:14:07,951 --> 00:14:10,471
Yeah, but then there was this
picture in the paper

206
00:14:10,506 --> 00:14:12,511
and Greg said it was the same bloke.

207
00:14:14,431 --> 00:14:17,271
Mrs Rider, is this the man you
saw in the paper?

208
00:14:19,671 --> 00:14:21,276
Yeah.

209
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:24,571
And is that when you realised
he hadn't been charged?

210
00:14:24,606 --> 00:14:27,831
I'd written down the name of this
Chief Superintendent

211
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:30,631
who had supposed to have taken
care of it all.

212
00:14:31,991 --> 00:14:34,711
Yeah? Sir, we've got a witness
claiming Fairbank suppressed

213
00:14:34,746 --> 00:14:37,511
a child-rape allegation
against Dale Roach.

214
00:14:39,591 --> 00:14:42,031
Ideally, sir, we'd put these
allegations to Fairbank

215
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:44,876
in the presence of a solicitor.

216
00:14:44,911 --> 00:14:47,951
Yeah, well, I'll have to think
about that. But, sir... Steve.

217
00:14:51,871 --> 00:14:53,951
Sir. Kate.

218
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:04,556
Sir, with respect,

219
00:15:04,591 --> 00:15:08,151
there's no operational reason to
drag our feet over Fairbank.

220
00:15:08,186 --> 00:15:10,551
I know how to conduct an
anti-corruption case, Steve.

221
00:15:10,586 --> 00:15:12,236
With respect, again, sir,

222
00:15:12,271 --> 00:15:15,071
I'm becoming concerned this
inquiry's dragging its feet.

223
00:15:16,711 --> 00:15:18,796
I'm not the issue here, son.

224
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:21,356
Sir? I can't have you interviewing
Fairbank

225
00:15:21,391 --> 00:15:23,836
because of the suspicions
hanging over your head.

226
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:26,871
That's why we're dragging our feet
here, against my better judgment.

227
00:15:26,906 --> 00:15:29,836
Still this crap about me planting
evidence against Lindsay Denton?

228
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:32,047
Listen, we'll bring Fairbank
in, but I can't have

229
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:34,071
you in the room. I will
not risk jeopardising

230
00:15:34,106 --> 00:15:36,123
future prosecutions. What,
you're taking me off

231
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,248
the case? Don't make this
harder than it is, son.

232
00:15:38,283 --> 00:15:40,388
Harder than protecting a
former Chief Super who just

233
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,317
happens to be a mason?
You are way out of line.

234
00:15:42,352 --> 00:15:44,299
I saw your handshake. You
do not know the first

235
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:46,351
thing. I know you're trying
to take me off a case

236
00:15:46,386 --> 00:15:48,756
that involves senior officers
covering up child abuse!

237
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:52,031
Suspicions against you are more than
just planting evidence, Steve.

238
00:16:05,311 --> 00:16:06,831
As you were.

239
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:13,351
Superintendent Hastings and I
have had a short discussion

240
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:17,228
and in the circumstances,
we agree the best course of action,

241
00:16:17,263 --> 00:16:21,071
to protect all parties and to abide
by disciplinary procedure,

242
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:24,676
is for you to be served with a
Regulation 15 notice

243
00:16:24,711 --> 00:16:27,631
and to be suspended from duty
until these matters can be addressed

244
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,551
at a formal disciplinary hearing.

245
00:16:30,586 --> 00:16:32,608
A Reg 15?

246
00:16:32,643 --> 00:16:34,596
For what?

247
00:16:34,631 --> 00:16:37,611
Certain allegations have been
made against you.

248
00:16:37,646 --> 00:16:40,591
By who? It wouldn't be appropriate
to discuss these

249
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:44,076
outside a recognised disciplinary
framework.

250
00:16:44,111 --> 00:16:47,711
But before you go, may I ask
if you're bearing a firearm?

251
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:54,031
This come from Dot?

252
00:16:55,271 --> 00:16:56,716
I want him in here.

253
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:58,871
I don't think that's a good idea.

254
00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:01,671
Fine.

255
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,756
I really don't think that's
a good idea.

256
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:08,991
My officer has asked for this,
so I'm going to give him this.

257
00:17:15,391 --> 00:17:17,151
DI Cottan.

258
00:17:29,471 --> 00:17:31,791
Sir. Gill.

259
00:17:36,031 --> 00:17:37,931
The floor is yours.

260
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:39,831
What's this all about?

261
00:17:41,471 --> 00:17:43,116
DI Cottan.

262
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:47,151
I have a number of concerns regarding
DS Arnott's professional conduct.

263
00:17:47,186 --> 00:17:49,236
He's been bearing a firearm
round the office.

264
00:17:49,271 --> 00:17:52,271
In contravention of Section 7
of the 1968 Firearms Act.

265
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:53,916
I've signed the firearm back in!

266
00:17:53,951 --> 00:17:56,356
He's been accused of having an
improper relationship

267
00:17:56,391 --> 00:17:59,271
with a suspect, of planting
evidence against said suspect.

268
00:17:59,306 --> 00:18:01,036
I did not plant evidence!

269
00:18:01,071 --> 00:18:03,471
He also fits the profile of
a suspect we're seeking

270
00:18:03,506 --> 00:18:05,271
in a separate anti-corruption
inquiry.

271
00:18:05,306 --> 00:18:08,036
What? This is insane!

272
00:18:08,071 --> 00:18:09,994
What anti-corruption inquiry?
I really don't

273
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,071
think any more should be
said about this matter

274
00:18:12,106 --> 00:18:15,711
while it's being investigated. Look, for
Christ's sake! I'm not the problem here.

275
00:18:15,746 --> 00:18:18,116
What exactly are you saying?

276
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:21,431
Sir, I've got serious concerns
about DI Cottan's performance

277
00:18:21,466 --> 00:18:23,308
of his duties under
police conduct regs

278
00:18:23,343 --> 00:18:25,327
and that's why he's having
a go at me.

279
00:18:25,362 --> 00:18:27,316
Sir, this is completely
out of order.

280
00:18:27,351 --> 00:18:29,236
During a search of Danny
Waldron's flat,

281
00:18:29,271 --> 00:18:32,071
he failed in his duty to order
the necessary forensics.

282
00:18:32,106 --> 00:18:34,268
He then induced a junior rank to
hide this from me

283
00:18:34,303 --> 00:18:36,396
so I wouldn't find out he'd
missed a crucial lead.

284
00:18:36,431 --> 00:18:39,551
Listen, if there's any issues to be
addressed by a performance review,

285
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:42,271
or otherwise, then trust me,
they certainly will be.

286
00:18:42,306 --> 00:18:45,008
However, said issues are separate
and distinct

287
00:18:45,043 --> 00:18:47,711
from the ones before us now,
DS Arnott. Look...

288
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:54,556
Please, I know I've pissed
you all off

289
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,891
and I am sorry about the undercover
on Lindsay Denton,

290
00:18:56,926 --> 00:18:59,156
but I am the only one that's trying
to solve this case!

291
00:18:59,191 --> 00:19:01,791
Oh, well, there you have it.
Only Steve can solve the cases.

292
00:19:01,826 --> 00:19:03,196
All hail Steve.

293
00:19:03,231 --> 00:19:05,448
I definitely think
we should stop this

294
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,031
conversation now. Thank
you, DI Cottan. Sir.

295
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,271
Thanks for keeping your cool in there,
Matthew. It can't have been easy.

296
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:24,756
DS Arnott, regarding the Reg 15
notice,

297
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:28,391
you will return here for a formal
interview at a time specified by us,

298
00:19:28,426 --> 00:19:31,871
but until then, you will be
suspended from duty. I'm sorry, son.

299
00:19:31,906 --> 00:19:34,076
I'm sorry.

300
00:19:34,111 --> 00:19:36,751
I know he's got his reasons.

301
00:19:36,786 --> 00:19:39,476
But you, sir?

302
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:43,271
You never answered my point about you
and Fairbank both being in the masons.

303
00:19:43,306 --> 00:19:45,876
Come on, Steve. You're not doing
yourself any favours here.

304
00:19:45,911 --> 00:19:48,141
It's one thing denying
allegations against you, but

305
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:50,351
it's another thing slinging
mud at your superiors.

306
00:19:50,386 --> 00:19:53,631
This is a different kettle of
fish, fella. What can I say?

307
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:56,236
You've let me down, you've let
yourself down.

308
00:19:56,271 --> 00:19:59,871
Yeah. Well, you're the one that fed
us all a doctored file on Ronan Murphy.

309
00:20:01,311 --> 00:20:03,316
What?

310
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:07,791
Ronan Murphy being a known criminal
associate of Tommy Hunter -

311
00:20:07,826 --> 00:20:09,916
not in the file.

312
00:20:09,951 --> 00:20:13,751
Ronan Murphy being investigated as
a prime suspect in Hunter's murder -

313
00:20:13,786 --> 00:20:15,436
not in the file.

314
00:20:15,471 --> 00:20:18,351
Ronan Murphy and Tommy Hunter both
being involved in

315
00:20:18,386 --> 00:20:21,311
child sexual exploitation -
not in the file!

316
00:20:22,751 --> 00:20:25,831
And you say I'm the one that's
letting you down.

317
00:20:27,631 --> 00:20:29,231
Sir.

318
00:20:52,071 --> 00:20:53,351
Are you OK?

319
00:20:55,231 --> 00:20:57,956
Yeah. I'm not going to jump to
conclusions.

320
00:20:57,991 --> 00:21:01,071
Let's see what comes out of
his disciplinary hearing.

321
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:09,791
Look, just between us, I've got
a lead on him planting

322
00:21:09,826 --> 00:21:11,271
that money at Lindsay's.

323
00:21:12,591 --> 00:21:15,791
I just wanted to let you know,
so it didn't come as a big shock.

324
00:21:15,826 --> 00:21:18,031
And I know this is going to be
difficult...

325
00:21:19,471 --> 00:21:21,471
.. but we've got to keep an eye on
his every move.

326
00:21:23,671 --> 00:21:25,391
Sorry.

327
00:21:41,951 --> 00:21:43,271
All right?

328
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:46,631
Thought these might cheer you up.

329
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,231
Come in.

330
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,951
They're really sweet, but
you didn't need to.

331
00:21:57,986 --> 00:21:59,391
No, you're all right.

332
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:09,431
Kate... Look, I'd be gutted if this
Steve stuff came between us.

333
00:22:10,951 --> 00:22:13,831
This feels like a bit of a second
chance for me...

334
00:22:15,391 --> 00:22:17,711
.. and I really don't want
to mess it up.

335
00:22:22,911 --> 00:22:24,156
Oh. OK.

336
00:22:24,191 --> 00:22:27,751
No. It's... Just let's take it slow.
You know?

337
00:22:27,786 --> 00:22:29,868
Yeah, yeah, of course.

338
00:22:29,903 --> 00:22:31,951
With the Regs and that?

339
00:22:31,986 --> 00:22:33,356
Sure.

340
00:22:33,391 --> 00:22:35,311
But thanks for these,
they're lovely.

341
00:22:35,346 --> 00:22:36,631
I'm glad you like them.

342
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,511
Well, I best be off. All right.

343
00:22:40,546 --> 00:22:42,311
Night. Night.

344
00:23:02,711 --> 00:23:03,991
How can I help you?

345
00:23:05,071 --> 00:23:08,911
Ma'am, I'm requesting authorisation
on an undercover operation.

346
00:23:11,031 --> 00:23:13,876
That's Ted Hastings' call, not mine.

347
00:23:13,911 --> 00:23:17,791
Well, actually, ma'am, it'd be
against a fellow AC-12 officer.

348
00:23:17,826 --> 00:23:18,956
Ah.

349
00:23:18,991 --> 00:23:21,436
In this situation, guidelines are
that I should approach

350
00:23:21,471 --> 00:23:25,311
an independent anti-corruption commander
in confidence for said authorisation.

351
00:23:25,346 --> 00:23:26,831
Why me?

352
00:23:27,871 --> 00:23:30,391
I'd rather not say, ma'am.

353
00:23:30,426 --> 00:23:31,911
AC-9's nearer.

354
00:23:34,071 --> 00:23:36,391
Like I say, I'd rather
not say, ma'am.

355
00:23:39,031 --> 00:23:41,511
Because I'm a woman,
I can't be a mason.

356
00:24:03,551 --> 00:24:05,031
You kept me waiting.

357
00:24:06,231 --> 00:24:10,271
I know. I've been watching for
an hour.

358
00:24:11,591 --> 00:24:13,991
If you'll hang on for that long,
then you must be desperate.

359
00:24:15,231 --> 00:24:18,756
It's funny, because the last time
we met, I was the desperate one

360
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:22,911
and you held all the cards. Yeah, well, you
don't hold them all of a sudden. Don't I?

361
00:24:22,946 --> 00:24:26,351
You know what, Steve, I'd deduced
that you are so desperate

362
00:24:26,386 --> 00:24:29,271
that you need help from some
sad cow with no life.

363
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:32,471
Silly me.

364
00:24:34,631 --> 00:24:36,111
Wait.

365
00:24:47,631 --> 00:24:49,991
There's something I never said
and I want to say it now.

366
00:24:51,631 --> 00:24:53,111
I'm sorry.

367
00:24:54,191 --> 00:24:55,831
I did take advantage of you.

368
00:24:57,391 --> 00:25:01,431
You were grieving, you were alone,
and gaining your trust -

369
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:05,751
albeit to solve a crime -
was callous and insensitive.

370
00:25:05,786 --> 00:25:07,431
I'm sorry for what I did.

371
00:25:08,951 --> 00:25:10,991
And you might not believe me,
but that night...

372
00:25:12,751 --> 00:25:14,711
.. that's what made me hold back.

373
00:25:16,831 --> 00:25:19,036
Don't flatter yourself, Steve.

374
00:25:19,071 --> 00:25:21,391
I might have been a
complete emotional wreck,

375
00:25:21,426 --> 00:25:22,631
but I didn't want you.

376
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:26,951
We were just two lonely
people having a fumble.

377
00:25:26,986 --> 00:25:28,988
It might've sounded
convincing on tape,

378
00:25:29,023 --> 00:25:30,991
but it was empty
and it was pathetic.

379
00:25:33,271 --> 00:25:34,991
Back to planting of evidence.

380
00:25:38,231 --> 00:25:40,196
The accusation's been around so long

381
00:25:40,231 --> 00:25:43,271
that people are starting to
think they don't have to prove it.

382
00:25:43,306 --> 00:25:46,311
Instead, it's down
to me to disprove it.

383
00:25:46,346 --> 00:25:48,276
You know the truth.

384
00:25:48,311 --> 00:25:49,831
You know I didn't do it.

385
00:25:51,111 --> 00:25:52,551
Listen to me...

386
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:04,231
I've just spent a year and
a half of my life in prison.

387
00:26:05,671 --> 00:26:07,951
I've lost everything -

388
00:26:07,986 --> 00:26:09,668
my home,

389
00:26:09,703 --> 00:26:11,316
my job,

390
00:26:11,351 --> 00:26:13,031
my whole future.

391
00:26:16,151 --> 00:26:19,591
Maybe now, you've got a
taste of what it's like

392
00:26:19,626 --> 00:26:21,716
to know that you're innocent

393
00:26:21,751 --> 00:26:25,631
and yet still have your
whole life destroyed.

394
00:26:33,671 --> 00:26:38,151
Look, I'll help you find
the real criminals, Steve,

395
00:26:38,186 --> 00:26:42,631
but I will never, ever spend
one more day in prison.

396
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:45,676
So, let me be clear -

397
00:26:45,711 --> 00:26:49,991
that money was put in
my house to frame me.

398
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:53,956
I am innocent.

399
00:26:53,991 --> 00:26:56,431
I am the victim in all of this.

400
00:26:56,466 --> 00:26:59,671
You're unbelievable. No.

401
00:26:59,706 --> 00:27:01,876
No, I want justice

402
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:04,391
and I don't care how
unjustly I get it.

403
00:27:06,671 --> 00:27:09,391
So, why don't you just tell
me everything you know

404
00:27:09,426 --> 00:27:11,351
about the case
that you're working on

405
00:27:11,386 --> 00:27:13,031
and how it connects to mine?

406
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:14,316
You must be joking.

407
00:27:14,351 --> 00:27:17,231
Right now, Steve, I'm the only
person that can help you.

408
00:27:21,351 --> 00:27:23,476
Hi, Ted.

409
00:27:23,511 --> 00:27:25,316
What's with all the
cloak and dagger?

410
00:27:25,351 --> 00:27:27,151
Well, I wanted to ask you,
off the record,

411
00:27:27,186 --> 00:27:28,636
if I can count on your full support

412
00:27:28,671 --> 00:27:31,791
in investigating former Chief
Superintendent Patrick Fairbank?

413
00:27:31,826 --> 00:27:33,036
In respect of...?

414
00:27:33,071 --> 00:27:35,791
In respect of not adequately
investigating complaints

415
00:27:35,826 --> 00:27:37,591
of child sexual exploitation.

416
00:27:39,071 --> 00:27:40,236
Absolutely.

417
00:27:40,271 --> 00:27:42,471
Absolutely. Thanks.

418
00:27:44,071 --> 00:27:46,356
Ted, doesn't it make much more sense

419
00:27:46,391 --> 00:27:48,911
to hand over your files
to the various authorities

420
00:27:48,946 --> 00:27:50,751
carrying out official inquiries

421
00:27:50,786 --> 00:27:52,716
into historic sex abuse?

422
00:27:52,751 --> 00:27:54,716
You can do it through me,
if you like.

423
00:27:54,751 --> 00:27:56,631
Yeah, that would be great.
Thank you, Gill.

424
00:27:56,666 --> 00:27:58,511
Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Ted.

425
00:28:01,871 --> 00:28:03,731
We got seats at the pavilion end,

426
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,556
right behind the bowler's arm,

427
00:28:05,591 --> 00:28:08,671
and I'm thinking, you know,
"We're set for the day here,"

428
00:28:08,706 --> 00:28:10,711
and then what happened?

429
00:28:10,746 --> 00:28:12,111
Heavens opened.

430
00:28:12,146 --> 00:28:13,231
Ted!

431
00:28:15,591 --> 00:28:17,551
I'm sure there's no
need for all this

432
00:28:17,586 --> 00:28:19,156
over a little misunderstanding.

433
00:28:19,191 --> 00:28:21,276
We can thrash this out
between the pair of us.

434
00:28:21,311 --> 00:28:23,691
I think it's best that we
continue as planned, really,

435
00:28:23,726 --> 00:28:26,071
just to make sure that
everything's above board and...

436
00:28:26,106 --> 00:28:27,311
I'm in your hands.

437
00:28:27,346 --> 00:28:28,716
Tea? Coffee?

438
00:28:28,751 --> 00:28:30,631
Very nice. Coffee, thanks.

439
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:31,711
Great.

440
00:28:46,111 --> 00:28:48,791
'You are being interviewed
today in respect of suspicion

441
00:28:48,826 --> 00:28:50,548
'of misconduct in public office.

442
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:52,236
'You don't have to say anything -

446
00:29:00,386 --> 00:29:02,268
Been there, done that. Thank you.

447
00:29:02,303 --> 00:29:04,151
Document two in your folders.

448
00:29:05,431 --> 00:29:08,031
Document two is a photocopy
of a missing persons report

449
00:29:08,066 --> 00:29:10,756
relating to Oliver Stephens-Lloyd.

450
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,671
You were shown this photocopy
in your interview on July 7th.

451
00:29:13,706 --> 00:29:15,608
It's from near-on 20 years ago.

452
00:29:15,643 --> 00:29:17,857
You don't recall the report?

453
00:29:17,892 --> 00:29:20,036
I don't recall the report, no.

454
00:29:20,071 --> 00:29:22,596
Well, if you could go to
the end of the report,

455
00:29:22,631 --> 00:29:25,351
you were shown that a number of
individuals have been copied in

456
00:29:25,386 --> 00:29:27,271
by the senior investigating officer.

457
00:29:27,306 --> 00:29:29,351
I have to put my... glasses on.

458
00:29:31,511 --> 00:29:32,551
Right.

459
00:29:33,911 --> 00:29:37,191
You were shown, on July 7th, that,
according to the distribution list,

460
00:29:37,226 --> 00:29:39,871
you were sent a copy of
this report in November '98.

461
00:29:39,906 --> 00:29:42,476
Yep. Seems I was sent one.

462
00:29:42,511 --> 00:29:44,996
God knows whether
I got it or read it.

463
00:29:45,031 --> 00:29:47,951
During this time, November '98,
what was your position?

464
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:49,476
I ran Vice. Yep.

465
00:29:49,511 --> 00:29:52,051
And why was the head of Vice
being copied into a report

466
00:29:52,086 --> 00:29:54,591
on a missing social worker?
I have absolutely no idea.

467
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,831
It sounds like an admin error to me.

468
00:29:56,866 --> 00:29:58,996
An administrative error?

469
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:01,711
Well, I'm surmising. I've no idea.

470
00:30:01,746 --> 00:30:02,751
Sorry.

471
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:07,276
'Document three in your folders. '

472
00:30:07,311 --> 00:30:11,911
Document three is a photocopy of
a report, dated 21st November '98,

473
00:30:11,946 --> 00:30:14,848
on death by suicide
of Oliver Stephens-Lloyd.

474
00:30:14,883 --> 00:30:17,817
Stephens-Lloyd claimed
to have furnished you

475
00:30:17,852 --> 00:30:20,716
with a list of names
of abusers at Sands View.

476
00:30:20,751 --> 00:30:23,551
Shortly afterwards, he was
dismissed from his position

477
00:30:23,586 --> 00:30:26,191
and three months later,
he was found dead.

478
00:30:26,226 --> 00:30:27,996
I don't know anything about a list

479
00:30:28,031 --> 00:30:30,356
and I don't know anything
about this poor fella.

480
00:30:30,391 --> 00:30:32,831
Yeah, well, the Murder Squad
have reopened the inquiry

481
00:30:32,866 --> 00:30:35,391
into the death of
Oliver Stephens-Lloyd.

482
00:30:35,426 --> 00:30:36,988
Right.

483
00:30:37,023 --> 00:30:38,516
Well...

484
00:30:38,551 --> 00:30:41,356
now, Ted, this is getting serious.

485
00:30:41,391 --> 00:30:43,476
Yeah, but this is also
an opportunity for you

486
00:30:43,511 --> 00:30:46,391
to clarify a number of issues
that are causing us some vexation.

487
00:30:46,426 --> 00:30:48,751
Well, you know I want to help.
And we're very grateful.

488
00:30:48,786 --> 00:30:49,876
DC Fleming.

489
00:30:49,911 --> 00:30:52,271
Document five is a recent
postmortem examination

490
00:30:52,306 --> 00:30:54,088
from the Home Office pathologist.

491
00:30:54,123 --> 00:30:55,836
It's likely that Stephens-Lloyd

492
00:30:55,871 --> 00:30:58,391
was struck over the head
with a blunt instrument

493
00:30:58,426 --> 00:31:00,711
and then thrown into
the river to drown.

494
00:31:00,746 --> 00:31:02,951
So, not suicide.

495
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,156
Murder.

496
00:31:04,191 --> 00:31:06,356
Well, I can see why
you're troubled, Ted,

497
00:31:06,391 --> 00:31:09,996
but MY department had no
involvement in that investigation.

498
00:31:10,031 --> 00:31:14,831
Well, we interviewed the officers
who carried out this investigation.

499
00:31:14,866 --> 00:31:16,848
We have a statement
obtained by Murder Squad,

500
00:31:16,883 --> 00:31:18,796
from an officer who
was a DC at the time,

501
00:31:18,831 --> 00:31:21,511
stating that the senior
investigating officer,

502
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,076
DI Marcus Thurwell,

503
00:31:23,111 --> 00:31:24,911
advised him the death was suicide

504
00:31:24,946 --> 00:31:26,708
and anything that didn't fit

505
00:31:26,743 --> 00:31:28,436
should be kept to themselves.

506
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:32,511
Now, why would Thurwell be so eager
to prove that it was a suicide?

507
00:31:34,231 --> 00:31:36,311
I haven't the foggiest.

508
00:31:38,711 --> 00:31:41,031
Do you recall the name Wendy Rider?

509
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,028
Well, I think we all know by now

510
00:31:43,063 --> 00:31:44,956
that I'm hopeless with names.

511
00:31:44,991 --> 00:31:47,391
Wendy Rider lodged a
complaint against you

512
00:31:47,426 --> 00:31:49,876
in respect of her son,
Gregory Rider.

513
00:31:49,911 --> 00:31:53,351
Gregory Rider was a resident
at Sands View Boys' Home

514
00:31:53,386 --> 00:31:56,791
and was allegedly abused by
your best mate, Dale Roach.

515
00:31:56,826 --> 00:31:58,036
Right, Ted.

516
00:31:58,071 --> 00:32:00,711
Now, this was meant to be
a friendly conversation

517
00:32:00,746 --> 00:32:02,436
but your DC, whatever her name is,

518
00:32:02,471 --> 00:32:04,951
has just struck a tone
that I don't warm to.

519
00:32:06,631 --> 00:32:08,436
DC Fleming.

520
00:32:08,471 --> 00:32:10,396
My apologies if I've caused offence.

521
00:32:10,431 --> 00:32:12,631
We are most grateful for
your cooperation, sir.

522
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:15,351
I knew Councillor Roach
from a distance,

523
00:32:15,386 --> 00:32:16,911
a very great distance.

524
00:32:18,511 --> 00:32:21,191
Going back to your interview
with us on July 7th -

525
00:32:21,226 --> 00:32:22,636
you stated,

526
00:32:22,671 --> 00:32:25,311
"When these things came up,
they would have been looked into. "

527
00:32:25,346 --> 00:32:26,716
Do you stand by that statement?

528
00:32:26,751 --> 00:32:29,931
Well, I must have said it
if you've written it down.

529
00:32:29,966 --> 00:32:33,111
Can you inform us how you
investigated the allegations

530
00:32:33,146 --> 00:32:36,231
made by Mrs Rider
against Dale Roach?

531
00:32:36,266 --> 00:32:37,476
It'll be in the files.

532
00:32:37,511 --> 00:32:39,076
We looked, it's not in the files.

533
00:32:39,111 --> 00:32:41,236
I was Chief Superintendent,
not the office boy.

534
00:32:41,271 --> 00:32:44,151
If records have gone missing,
that's got nothing to do with me.

535
00:32:44,186 --> 00:32:46,076
Mrs Rider says that she was informed

536
00:32:46,111 --> 00:32:48,631
that you carried out
this interview yourself,

537
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,196
and that no charge resulted.

538
00:32:50,231 --> 00:32:52,911
Well, that must be because
the allegations against Dale

539
00:32:52,946 --> 00:32:54,271
proved groundless.

540
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:55,876
"Dale"?

541
00:32:55,911 --> 00:32:58,076
Councillor Roach.

542
00:32:58,111 --> 00:33:01,551
Why did you not keep
any records of this?

543
00:33:01,586 --> 00:33:03,036
Here we go again.

544
00:33:03,071 --> 00:33:05,511
I was Chief Super...
"Superintendent. "

545
00:33:05,546 --> 00:33:07,151
Yeah, I know. "Not the office boy,"

546
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:08,636
but this was your department -

547
00:33:08,671 --> 00:33:10,516
and this was a very
serious allegation

548
00:33:10,551 --> 00:33:13,391
against a prominent, you know,
public individual.

549
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:15,556
Me, I can't think of
any reason in the world

550
00:33:15,591 --> 00:33:18,231
why you wouldn't have wanted
to be across all this yourself

551
00:33:18,266 --> 00:33:21,831
and why there is no
record of the investigation.

552
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:23,716
Unless there was no investigation.

553
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,391
Unless you were sweeping
all this under the carpet

554
00:33:26,426 --> 00:33:28,311
to protect your friend.

555
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:35,511
Did any of the boys at Sands View

556
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,356
complain about sexual abuse

557
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:40,311
to you or any of the
officers you knew of?

558
00:33:40,346 --> 00:33:42,196
God, no. Absolutely not.

559
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:46,111
Because you would have investigated
it. Correct, 100% correct.

560
00:33:48,471 --> 00:33:50,316
You and your solicitor

561
00:33:50,351 --> 00:33:53,751
have a written request from a
police officer of inspector rank,

562
00:33:53,786 --> 00:33:57,568
independent of this inquiry and
prior to this voluntary interview,

563
00:33:57,603 --> 00:34:01,351
requesting your participation in
a video identification process.

564
00:34:01,386 --> 00:34:04,711
Mr Fairbank is reluctant to
submit himself to a process

565
00:34:04,746 --> 00:34:06,831
dependent on - what
must, by now, be -

566
00:34:06,866 --> 00:34:08,871
extremely unreliable memories.

567
00:34:11,831 --> 00:34:13,431
OK.

568
00:34:15,151 --> 00:34:16,996
DC Fleming.

569
00:34:17,031 --> 00:34:19,331
Item reference ASJ-76

570
00:34:19,366 --> 00:34:21,438
is a newspaper cutting

571
00:34:21,473 --> 00:34:23,476
dated 14th March '97.

572
00:34:23,511 --> 00:34:25,651
Do you recognise this image?

573
00:34:25,686 --> 00:34:27,756
It's me and Councillor Roach.

574
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:29,831
What was your connection
with the charity?

575
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:31,836
Well, I would be there,
at his invitation,

576
00:34:31,871 --> 00:34:34,196
if he thought there was
a crime-prevention angle -

577
00:34:34,231 --> 00:34:38,551
keeping young lads this side
of the law, that sort of thing.

578
00:34:38,586 --> 00:34:41,551
Item reference ASJ-116.

579
00:34:45,511 --> 00:34:50,011
Item ASJ-116 is a newspaper
clipping dated 7th August 1995.

580
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:54,511
For the tape, I am showing the
interviewee a copy of this item.

581
00:34:54,546 --> 00:34:56,831
Do you recognise the man
in this photograph with you

582
00:34:56,866 --> 00:34:58,791
and Councillor Dale Roach?

583
00:34:58,826 --> 00:35:00,276
I think we all do.

584
00:35:00,311 --> 00:35:02,591
And was he involved
in the charities too?

585
00:35:02,626 --> 00:35:03,916
I believe so.

586
00:35:03,951 --> 00:35:05,436
Some of them, yes.

587
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:10,311
So, in addition to the complaints
made about Councillor Dale Roach,

588
00:35:10,346 --> 00:35:12,076
were there any other complaints

589
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:14,691
made about any other
prominent individuals

590
00:35:14,726 --> 00:35:17,271
involved in sexual
assaults on young people?

591
00:35:17,306 --> 00:35:19,631
Not that I recall.

592
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:20,956
Right.

593
00:35:20,991 --> 00:35:23,751
Because according to our
colleagues in Operation Yewtree,

594
00:35:23,786 --> 00:35:25,796
there were numerous complaints.

595
00:35:25,831 --> 00:35:28,751
And according to our colleagues
in Operation Midland,

596
00:35:28,786 --> 00:35:31,596
there were numerous complaints.

597
00:35:31,631 --> 00:35:35,151
So, why did you not
investigate any of these?

598
00:35:35,186 --> 00:35:38,671
I don't recall any
specific investigations.

599
00:35:38,706 --> 00:35:40,636
We know there were complaints.

600
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:42,876
We know you were supposed
to investigate them.

601
00:35:42,911 --> 00:35:46,511
And on the 7th July, you confessed
that you investigated them.

602
00:35:46,546 --> 00:35:48,288
I must sound like a stuck record,

603
00:35:48,323 --> 00:35:50,031
but I honestly don't remember.

604
00:35:50,066 --> 00:35:51,631
It's the honest truth.

605
00:35:52,831 --> 00:35:54,711
Were you under pressure...

606
00:35:54,746 --> 00:35:56,111
to turn a blind eye?

607
00:35:57,551 --> 00:35:58,991
I don't know how you mean, Ted.

608
00:35:59,026 --> 00:36:01,628
From executive officers

609
00:36:01,663 --> 00:36:04,196
or political interests.

610
00:36:04,231 --> 00:36:06,251
What's put that idea in your head?

611
00:36:06,286 --> 00:36:08,098
What we have here is Dale Roach

612
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:09,876
interfering with young boys.

613
00:36:09,911 --> 00:36:12,111
Now, call me a cynic
but he's a politician

614
00:36:12,146 --> 00:36:13,916
and they are all born liars.

615
00:36:13,951 --> 00:36:16,036
Then we have this
celebrity up here

616
00:36:16,071 --> 00:36:19,591
and we all know show business people
have very low morals -

617
00:36:19,626 --> 00:36:21,591
but you were a police officer!

618
00:36:23,231 --> 00:36:24,751
The Chief Superintendent.

619
00:36:31,751 --> 00:36:34,151
I really want to help,
Ted, but I don't...

620
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:37,391
.. see what more I can say.

621
00:36:38,391 --> 00:36:41,351
May I ask, how far are we
going with this today?

622
00:36:41,386 --> 00:36:44,311
Do you have any evidence
to put to Mr Fairbank?

623
00:36:45,671 --> 00:36:47,691
No, no, this is a
voluntary interview.

624
00:36:47,726 --> 00:36:49,798
He's just helping us
with our inquiries.

625
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,772
I'm sorry that I can't
fill in the blanks

626
00:36:51,807 --> 00:36:53,711
but, you know, I'm not
as sharp as I was.

627
00:36:53,746 --> 00:36:55,031
So you keep saying.

628
00:36:57,271 --> 00:36:58,791
Interview terminated.

629
00:37:00,311 --> 00:37:02,131
Anything else I can do,

630
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:03,951
don't hesitate to ask.

631
00:37:06,551 --> 00:37:08,831
CCTV showed Danny Waldron
arriving here early

632
00:37:08,866 --> 00:37:11,111
the morning after he
killed Linus Murphy.

633
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,196
He came in from that direction,

634
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,251
deposited evidence
in a storage container

635
00:37:15,286 --> 00:37:17,271
and then he left on
foot in that direction.

636
00:37:17,306 --> 00:37:19,716
What, the way back to his flat?
Yeah.

637
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:21,831
I mean, Danny was laying
a trail for us to find

638
00:37:21,866 --> 00:37:23,356
if anything happened to him.

639
00:37:23,391 --> 00:37:26,431
There was even an envelope
addressed to me, but it was empty.

640
00:37:26,466 --> 00:37:28,076
Forensics suggest, at one time,

641
00:37:28,111 --> 00:37:30,751
it contained a note written
immediately after the murder.

642
00:37:30,786 --> 00:37:33,391
Now, I believe Danny got
information out of Linus Murphy

643
00:37:33,426 --> 00:37:36,396
that enabled him to compile
a list of abusers.

644
00:37:36,431 --> 00:37:39,191
Well, if Danny had written the list
while he was still with Linus,

645
00:37:39,226 --> 00:37:41,311
then he must have had it
with him when he left here.

646
00:37:41,346 --> 00:37:43,436
If that was me...

647
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:45,911
I'd take the opportunity
to recce a safe spot,

648
00:37:45,946 --> 00:37:48,071
and then hide the list -

649
00:37:48,106 --> 00:37:49,356
or a backup copy -

650
00:37:49,391 --> 00:37:52,671
that night, under
the cover of darkness.

651
00:37:52,706 --> 00:37:53,711
Trust me.

652
00:37:55,911 --> 00:37:58,071
Well, you know all
about concealing evidence.

653
00:37:58,106 --> 00:38:00,088
I mean, you had to hide 50 grand.

654
00:38:00,123 --> 00:38:02,071
That's not what happened at all.

655
00:38:15,151 --> 00:38:17,076
My God, he's with Denton.

656
00:38:17,111 --> 00:38:19,156
See? The pair of them
are in it together.

657
00:38:19,191 --> 00:38:21,751
See? I told you we had
to watch his every move.

658
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:26,911
They're retracing Danny's steps.

659
00:38:26,946 --> 00:38:28,351
Why?

660
00:38:34,191 --> 00:38:36,711
Danny's flat is just
over on the next street.

661
00:38:36,746 --> 00:38:39,031
Any further and he
risked being spotted.

662
00:38:47,671 --> 00:38:49,391
I think I know what he did.

663
00:39:12,591 --> 00:39:14,756
Gill.

664
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:16,771
I understand you decided to proceed

665
00:39:16,806 --> 00:39:18,716
with questioning Patrick Fairbank.

666
00:39:18,751 --> 00:39:21,371
Yeah. I decided to put
the man on the spot myself,

667
00:39:21,406 --> 00:39:23,991
rather than turn it over
to some other department.

668
00:39:24,026 --> 00:39:26,111
There's conflict of interest.

669
00:39:26,146 --> 00:39:28,156
How exactly?

670
00:39:28,191 --> 00:39:30,716
Your affiliation with Fairbank.

671
00:39:30,751 --> 00:39:34,351
I've never put my personal loyalties
above my professional duty.

672
00:39:34,386 --> 00:39:35,676
You're being naive.

673
00:39:35,711 --> 00:39:37,311
I'm not referring to any...

674
00:39:37,346 --> 00:39:39,716
ordinary relationship.

675
00:39:39,751 --> 00:39:42,196
What will it look like if
Fairbank slips any inquiry

676
00:39:42,231 --> 00:39:44,991
and then it's revealed that
the senior investigating officer

677
00:39:45,026 --> 00:39:48,148
is part of the same
closed organisation?

678
00:39:48,183 --> 00:39:51,271
What organisation
are you talking about?

679
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:52,708
Secret handshakes,

680
00:39:52,743 --> 00:39:54,111
bare trouser legs.

681
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:58,751
Whatever it is you're alluding to,
I am not at liberty to discuss it.

682
00:39:58,786 --> 00:40:01,311
No doubt Dale Roach was
part of the same lodge.

683
00:40:01,346 --> 00:40:03,436
We can't have it appear...

684
00:40:03,471 --> 00:40:06,391
that you're protecting Fairbank.
Protecting him?!

685
00:40:06,426 --> 00:40:08,916
I'm doing my level best
to investigate him!

686
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:11,591
There's substantial crossover
with other inquiries.

687
00:40:11,626 --> 00:40:13,871
Politically, it would be expedient

688
00:40:13,906 --> 00:40:15,236
to hand over our files

689
00:40:15,271 --> 00:40:17,516
and let Midland and
Yewtree run with it.

690
00:40:17,551 --> 00:40:21,471
I have been informed of systematic
depravity against children

691
00:40:21,506 --> 00:40:23,156
who were wards of the state

692
00:40:23,191 --> 00:40:25,871
by high-ranking
officials OF the state.

693
00:40:27,351 --> 00:40:29,391
Now, how much money
are we going to spend

694
00:40:29,426 --> 00:40:31,236
chasing clapped-out DJs

695
00:40:31,271 --> 00:40:33,756
when the people who knew
about this depravity -

696
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:36,631
and/or turned a blind eye to it,
and/or were involved in it -

697
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:38,996
are using that power to
cover their tracks?

698
00:40:39,031 --> 00:40:42,711
Individuals - I might add,
Gill - who appointed you.

699
00:40:44,431 --> 00:40:46,031
Well, that's absurd!

700
00:40:46,066 --> 00:40:47,591
Is it?

701
00:40:49,991 --> 00:40:51,916
Is it really?

702
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:53,351
Thank you for this file.

703
00:40:56,191 --> 00:41:00,071
Perhaps you could help me understand
why it's been doctored?

704
00:41:00,106 --> 00:41:01,248
Sorry?

705
00:41:01,283 --> 00:41:02,391
Doctored.

706
00:41:03,471 --> 00:41:06,236
And it was you, Gill,

707
00:41:06,271 --> 00:41:07,871
who brought me this file...

708
00:41:09,231 --> 00:41:11,831
.. with crucial pieces
of information omitted.

709
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:15,236
I can't explain how that happened.

710
00:41:15,271 --> 00:41:18,031
Oh, yeah? Well, I can
explain it to you.

711
00:41:18,066 --> 00:41:20,436
It happened because it was known

712
00:41:20,471 --> 00:41:23,991
that, behind the seemingly lawful
killing of a violent criminal,

713
00:41:24,026 --> 00:41:25,391
there lay a dark secret.

714
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:29,631
Probably the darkest secret
in our society today.

715
00:41:31,751 --> 00:41:35,231
So, are you going to advise me
who provided you with that file?

716
00:41:36,511 --> 00:41:38,316
Are you doing this on purpose, Ted?

717
00:41:38,351 --> 00:41:41,331
Doing what? Sophisticated
adults are perfectly capable

718
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:44,311
of working effectively,
despite personal intimacy -

719
00:41:44,346 --> 00:41:47,311
but clearly you're not
a sophisticated adult.

720
00:41:47,346 --> 00:41:49,076
Clearly I'm not.

721
00:41:49,111 --> 00:41:53,071
I only see black and white
with no grey areas in between.

722
00:41:53,106 --> 00:41:54,768
And anything that
happened between us

723
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,396
that went beyond the professional -

724
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:58,951
well, it was a mistake, and we
just have to put it behind us.

725
00:41:58,986 --> 00:42:01,168
You're right. It was a mistake...

726
00:42:01,203 --> 00:42:03,351
but not the biggest you've made.

727
00:42:13,071 --> 00:42:16,671
The only place we found on
our recce was a churchyard.

728
00:42:16,706 --> 00:42:20,271
Quiet, secluded, plenty of
places to hide something.

729
00:42:20,306 --> 00:42:22,471
The only problem that Danny faced

730
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:24,288
was finding the exact spot

731
00:42:24,323 --> 00:42:26,071
that he had hidden his list -

732
00:42:26,106 --> 00:42:28,116
days, weeks or...

733
00:42:28,151 --> 00:42:29,711
Well, possibly even months later.

734
00:42:37,751 --> 00:42:39,516
What's going on here?

735
00:42:39,551 --> 00:42:41,751
We're...
We're searching burial records.

736
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:55,876
Her?

737
00:42:55,911 --> 00:42:58,316
I'm sorry. We needed a
place to work. In our home?

738
00:42:58,351 --> 00:43:00,991
We're searching for a missing
piece of evidence. Oh, really?

739
00:43:01,026 --> 00:43:02,996
She's pieced together
how Danny Waldron's mind

740
00:43:03,031 --> 00:43:05,471
might have been working and
she's had enough experience

741
00:43:05,506 --> 00:43:08,031
of avoiding coppers.
You are unbelievable. I'm...

742
00:43:09,831 --> 00:43:11,671
I'm desperate.

743
00:43:15,591 --> 00:43:18,011
I'm going to get petrol
and some chocolate.

744
00:43:18,046 --> 00:43:20,431
When I come back,
she'd better be gone.

745
00:43:38,631 --> 00:43:41,351
What was the name of
the boys' home again?

746
00:43:41,386 --> 00:43:43,391
Sands View.

747
00:43:45,911 --> 00:43:48,391
Plot 121, Lenora Sands.

748
00:43:50,351 --> 00:43:52,031
I'm going alone.

749
00:43:52,066 --> 00:43:53,711
Steve, don't.

750
00:43:59,191 --> 00:44:01,196
Need a lift? No.

751
00:44:01,231 --> 00:44:04,071
I'll call you if I find anything.

752
00:44:04,106 --> 00:44:05,951
They're splitting up.

753
00:44:07,471 --> 00:44:08,991
You take Steve.

754
00:45:11,151 --> 00:45:12,651
DC Fleming.

755
00:45:12,686 --> 00:45:14,116
Kate, it's me.

756
00:45:14,151 --> 00:45:15,716
Look, as she was leaving,

757
00:45:15,751 --> 00:45:18,271
Lindsay looked like she'd led
Steve on a wild goose chase.

758
00:45:19,391 --> 00:45:20,876
Poor bastard.

759
00:45:20,911 --> 00:45:23,031
Yeah, well, don't you
feel too sorry for him.

760
00:45:23,066 --> 00:45:24,836
Why?

761
00:45:24,871 --> 00:45:27,036
That lead on Steve -

762
00:45:27,071 --> 00:45:28,796
it looks like it's going to pan out.

763
00:45:28,831 --> 00:45:31,391
He really did plant
that money at Lindsay's.

764
00:45:32,911 --> 00:45:34,396
I'm sorry.

765
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:36,391
Look, I just thought
you'd want to know

766
00:45:36,426 --> 00:45:38,951
before it becomes common knowledge.

767
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,671
Yeah, thanks.

768
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,711
I'm sorry.

769
00:46:17,631 --> 00:46:19,071
Kate?

770
00:46:20,471 --> 00:46:21,916
You were following me?

771
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,351
What are you doing here, Steve?

772
00:46:23,386 --> 00:46:24,768
Looking for the list.

773
00:46:24,803 --> 00:46:26,116
For Christ's sake, Steve.

774
00:46:26,151 --> 00:46:28,031
Whatever's going on
between you and Lindsay,

775
00:46:28,066 --> 00:46:29,556
I really don't give a shit any more.

776
00:46:29,591 --> 00:46:31,671
Danny Waldron died because
of what he was on to

777
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:33,308
and I'm trying to solve this case!

778
00:46:33,343 --> 00:46:34,911
You're not going to "solve"
anything.

779
00:46:34,946 --> 00:46:36,276
Lindsay's making a tit of you.

780
00:46:36,311 --> 00:46:38,391
But you and your new partner,
you deserve each other!

781
00:46:38,426 --> 00:46:40,151
And what's that supposed to mean?

782
00:46:40,186 --> 00:46:41,796
There's no list here, Steve!

783
00:46:41,831 --> 00:46:44,271
If there's not, Lindsay's
going to get what's coming!

784
00:46:44,306 --> 00:46:46,311
Well, she's not the only one.

785
00:46:48,791 --> 00:46:50,471
I trusted you.

786
00:46:50,506 --> 00:46:52,151
We were partners.

787
00:47:15,991 --> 00:47:18,191
He's on that first
machine on the right.

788
00:47:18,226 --> 00:47:19,791
Thanks.

789
00:47:20,911 --> 00:47:22,191
Hi, Joe.

790
00:47:22,226 --> 00:47:23,436
DC Fleming.

791
00:47:23,471 --> 00:47:24,756
Yeah, I remember.

792
00:47:24,791 --> 00:47:26,591
Joe, I need you to
look at some material

793
00:47:26,626 --> 00:47:28,436
from our inquiry into Sands View -

794
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:31,211
photos of individuals of a
certain age and appearance,

795
00:47:31,246 --> 00:47:33,951
to see if any of these men
could be the police officer

796
00:47:33,986 --> 00:47:36,071
you or other lads
made a complaint to.

797
00:47:38,511 --> 00:47:40,791
OK, well, show us them, then.

798
00:47:40,826 --> 00:47:41,916
I'm sorry, Joe,

799
00:47:41,951 --> 00:47:44,471
but there are strict rules on
photographic identification.

800
00:47:45,711 --> 00:47:48,671
You'll need to accompany
me to a police station.

801
00:48:06,351 --> 00:48:07,956
DI Denton.

802
00:48:07,991 --> 00:48:09,591
Did this man come in here...

803
00:48:11,231 --> 00:48:13,711
.. early one morning,
about two months ago?

804
00:48:19,591 --> 00:48:21,311
I'd have to check.

805
00:48:21,346 --> 00:48:22,716
Great.

806
00:48:22,751 --> 00:48:25,071
I'm looking at the
7th of June, around 8am.

807
00:49:01,551 --> 00:49:03,751
Joe, what is it? Joe?

808
00:49:03,786 --> 00:49:05,951
It's OK. It's OK.

809
00:49:07,551 --> 00:49:08,871
I don't believe it.

810
00:49:22,631 --> 00:49:23,996
All right?

811
00:49:24,031 --> 00:49:26,511
Oh, I'm fine. Thanks.

812
00:51:16,071 --> 00:51:17,711
Steve?

813
00:51:25,271 --> 00:51:26,796
Only me.

814
00:51:26,831 --> 00:51:29,151
Lindsay Denton, I'm
arresting you on suspicion

815
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:30,956
of impersonating
a police officer. No.

816
00:51:30,991 --> 00:51:33,831
And as you're on licence,
that'll mean a return to prison.

817
00:51:33,866 --> 00:51:35,151
What a crying shame.

818
00:51:35,186 --> 00:51:36,551
No, just wait.

819
00:51:36,586 --> 00:51:38,071
Wait.

820
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:42,036
Listen. All right?

821
00:51:42,071 --> 00:51:43,991
Don't take me to a police station.

822
00:51:44,026 --> 00:51:46,036
I request AC-12.

823
00:51:46,071 --> 00:51:47,791
I'm going to make a statement.

824
00:51:47,826 --> 00:51:49,236
No skin off my nose.

825
00:51:49,271 --> 00:51:52,111
I thought it was Steve's car
till I saw the registration.

826
00:51:52,146 --> 00:51:54,156
Yeah, well, my
Ferrari's in the shop -

827
00:51:54,191 --> 00:51:57,271
so I had to get a carpool job
with the rest of the rabble.

828
00:52:00,551 --> 00:52:01,676
No back roads.

829
00:52:01,711 --> 00:52:03,351
Just stick to the main drag.

830
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:04,716
Don't worry,

831
00:52:04,751 --> 00:52:08,471
I'm not going to put my hand on
your knee, if that's what you think.

832
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:16,911
So, what's all this big news
you've got for us then?

833
00:52:18,551 --> 00:52:20,031
All in good time.

834
00:52:24,911 --> 00:52:26,431
I said, "No back roads. "

835
00:52:26,466 --> 00:52:27,756
Change of plan.

836
00:52:27,791 --> 00:52:29,631
Nearest station's Polk Avenue.

837
00:52:29,666 --> 00:52:30,996
I'll take you in there

838
00:52:31,031 --> 00:52:33,671
and they can charge you for
impersonating a police officer.

839
00:52:33,706 --> 00:52:35,671
That's you back inside, end of.

840
00:52:38,791 --> 00:52:40,191
OK, listen.

841
00:52:41,871 --> 00:52:43,591
I found Danny Waldron's list.

842
00:52:45,671 --> 00:52:48,031
The VIPs who were abusing
boys at Sands View.

843
00:52:49,271 --> 00:52:50,851
How'd you manage that then?

844
00:52:50,886 --> 00:52:52,396
It didn't make sense for Danny

845
00:52:52,431 --> 00:52:54,076
to make a hard copy
of the original list

846
00:52:54,111 --> 00:52:56,751
that could be lost or destroyed.
He'd make an online copy.

847
00:52:56,786 --> 00:52:59,391
Obviously, you'd have already
seized his phone and computers.

848
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,476
Yeah, obviously.

849
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:02,991
He would have used a device
that couldn't be traced to him,

850
00:53:03,026 --> 00:53:05,471
and I spotted an internet cafe
just off his route home.

851
00:53:05,506 --> 00:53:07,408
He used a webcam on
one of the computers

852
00:53:07,443 --> 00:53:09,276
to capture an image
of the original list.

853
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,916
So, how'd you manage to
crack his passwords and that?

854
00:53:11,951 --> 00:53:14,711
Well, you'd already harvested
Danny's usernames and passwords

855
00:53:14,746 --> 00:53:15,836
on his phone.

856
00:53:15,871 --> 00:53:18,396
Computer and online accounts
are all recorded here.

857
00:53:18,431 --> 00:53:21,951
Fortunately, people have a habit of
recycling usernames and passwords.

858
00:53:21,986 --> 00:53:24,591
So, how did you manage
to find his e-mail?

859
00:53:24,626 --> 00:53:25,956
We looked everywhere.

860
00:53:25,991 --> 00:53:29,471
Danny was smart enough to keep
the e-mail only as a draft.

861
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:30,908
If it isn't sent...

862
00:53:30,943 --> 00:53:32,311
it can't be traced.

863
00:53:33,751 --> 00:53:36,111
Well, you've thought of
everything, haven't you?

864
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:37,311
Oh, I have indeed.

865
00:53:38,551 --> 00:53:41,236
I deleted Danny's draft.

866
00:53:41,271 --> 00:53:44,131
The only place that list exists...

867
00:53:44,166 --> 00:53:46,956
is as a draft in my e-mail account.

868
00:53:46,991 --> 00:53:49,631
So, you take me to AC-12
and I'll hand it over.

869
00:53:50,911 --> 00:53:52,231
At a price, naturally.

870
00:53:53,471 --> 00:53:55,311
So, what price would that be, then?

871
00:53:55,346 --> 00:53:57,511
My convictions quashed,

872
00:53:57,546 --> 00:53:59,996
a full pardon.

873
00:54:00,031 --> 00:54:01,951
A clean slate? Hmm?

874
00:54:01,986 --> 00:54:03,596
A fresh start?

875
00:54:03,631 --> 00:54:05,551
Are you making fun of me?

876
00:54:05,586 --> 00:54:07,031
Actually, I wasn't.

877
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:11,111
You just take me
to AC-12, all right?

878
00:54:15,751 --> 00:54:17,236
You know what?

879
00:54:17,271 --> 00:54:19,691
Don't worry, I'm going
to call them myself.

880
00:54:19,726 --> 00:54:22,111
Look, AC-12 don't want
nothing to do with you,

881
00:54:22,146 --> 00:54:23,756
they just want you back in prison.

882
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:26,191
What, you're
different somehow, are you?

883
00:54:27,951 --> 00:54:30,996
I know you took that bribe, Lindsay.

884
00:54:31,031 --> 00:54:33,996
But you didn't do it
for the money, did you?

885
00:54:34,031 --> 00:54:37,791
You took it because you
wanted to find a young girl...

886
00:54:37,826 --> 00:54:40,551
who was being groomed
by Hunter and his cronies.

887
00:54:43,591 --> 00:54:45,211
How do you know that?

888
00:54:45,246 --> 00:54:46,618
50 grand the first time.

889
00:54:46,653 --> 00:54:47,991
100 grand this time?

890
00:54:50,471 --> 00:54:52,511
What? Face facts, Lindsay.

891
00:54:52,546 --> 00:54:55,036
Your old life...

892
00:54:55,071 --> 00:54:57,071
No, that's a pipe dream.

893
00:54:57,106 --> 00:54:59,196
It's gone.

894
00:54:59,231 --> 00:55:01,276
Yeah, it's sad.

895
00:55:01,311 --> 00:55:04,551
The only way you can
get a fresh start...

896
00:55:04,586 --> 00:55:06,916
Well, do I have to spell it out?

897
00:55:06,951 --> 00:55:09,631
100 grand and you forget
about all of this -

898
00:55:09,666 --> 00:55:11,191
that list included.

899
00:55:12,751 --> 00:55:15,751
All you have to do is
forget about everything.

900
00:55:15,786 --> 00:55:17,031
All of this.

901
00:55:21,511 --> 00:55:24,871
Look, just take the money, you
mad bitch, and stay out of it!

902
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:29,671
What are you doing?

903
00:55:31,311 --> 00:55:33,111
Why don't you just take the money?!

904
00:55:33,146 --> 00:55:34,831
Because I'm a police officer!

905
00:55:52,551 --> 00:55:53,671
DI Cottan...

906
00:55:54,671 --> 00:55:57,911
.. we are two feet apart
in a confined space.

907
00:55:59,351 --> 00:56:00,991
Frankly, for you...

908
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:03,871
.. this is a forensic ground zero.

909
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:10,231
Don't do that.

910
00:56:11,671 --> 00:56:15,071
You had four, five people killed

911
00:56:15,106 --> 00:56:16,956
and me framed -

912
00:56:16,991 --> 00:56:19,996
I expect you had
Danny Waldron killed too -

913
00:56:20,031 --> 00:56:22,711
and never a single speck
of blood on your hands.

914
00:56:26,871 --> 00:56:28,631
You want to shoot me?

915
00:56:30,431 --> 00:56:31,711
You go ahead.

916
00:56:33,471 --> 00:56:36,031
If it sends you to prison,
that is my job done.

917
00:56:37,791 --> 00:56:39,991
Do not send that message.

918
00:56:43,311 --> 00:56:44,831
You're just a go-between.

919
00:56:46,071 --> 00:56:47,471
You're a weasel.

920
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:51,431
Other people do your
dirty work for you.

921
00:56:53,591 --> 00:56:55,871
Now, you put that gun away

922
00:56:55,906 --> 00:56:58,151
and you take me to AC-12.

923
00:57:01,231 --> 00:57:03,991
Let's see what they all
think when I bring you in.

924
00:57:05,231 --> 00:57:07,071
When I bring in the Caddy.

925
00:57:22,351 --> 00:57:24,111
No.

926
00:57:24,146 --> 00:57:25,871
No!

926
00:57:26,305 --> 00:58:26,879

1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,999
Operation Pear Tree files show
that DS Corbett has been out

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,565
of contact with his COM and Cover
Officer for nearly three months.

3
00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:09,518
In that time,
he's believed to have actively

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,756
participated in criminal offences,
namely the hijack of

5
00:00:12,757 --> 00:00:17,479
Seized Goods Transport ED-905, the
murder of three AFOs, the attempted

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,759
murder of a fourth, and possibly
even the death of Maneet Bindra.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,719
Corbett relayed intel on a laptop

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,531
being used to communicate
with higher levels of the OCG.

9
00:00:25,532 --> 00:00:26,946
Have you harvested enough information

10
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:29,251
for us to impersonate the
unknown user online?

11
00:00:29,252 --> 00:00:32,151
Yes, given time,
we can simulate all the metadata.

12
00:00:32,152 --> 00:00:34,491
Hargreaves crossed us, so who's he
going to have crossed us to?

13
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,651
So who do you think's the best
man for the job?

14
00:00:36,652 --> 00:00:39,691
H is a senior police officer.
Tell me I'm wrong.

15
00:00:40,827 --> 00:00:43,527
The PCC is anxious for a breakthrough.

16
00:00:43,528 --> 00:00:45,931
Not to worry. We're going to get our man.

17
00:00:45,932 --> 00:00:48,171
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

18
00:00:48,172 --> 00:00:50,091
- How much?
- Hundred grand.

19
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:51,492
Haven't we earned a payday?

20
00:00:53,372 --> 00:00:55,011
John Corbett, I'm arresting you

21
00:00:55,012 --> 00:00:57,204
for the murder of Lester Ha...

22
00:00:57,205 --> 00:01:00,411
I didn't mean to kill Hargreaves,
but now I have...

23
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,452
...I've crossed the line.

24
00:01:04,966 --> 00:01:08,371
Mrs Hastings,
I'm Detective Sergeant Steve Arnott.

25
00:01:09,605 --> 00:01:12,878
A man broke in wearing a balaclava
over his face.

26
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,891
He said you'd know why he did it.

27
00:01:15,892 --> 00:01:17,645
John Corbett was the name he was given

28
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,666
when he was adopted by
the Corbett family.

29
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:22,095
His adoptive mother's maiden
name was McGillis.

30
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,639
He was born in Belfast.

31
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,159
Does your husband have any
connection to Northern Ireland?

32
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,599
John, they was here again, them
two from anti-corruption.

33
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,966
What did they want?

34
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:32,039
They was asking about
Northern Ireland and that.

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,440
They was even asking about family
over there.

36
00:01:36,766 --> 00:01:38,846
- It'd be nice to catch up.
- Yes.

37
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,743
Maybe you could help us
by describing any of the police

38
00:01:44,744 --> 00:01:46,270
that raided the print shop.

39
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:48,200
I take photos.

40
00:01:49,332 --> 00:01:51,226
Christ, how long she's been there?

41
00:01:54,425 --> 00:01:55,984
I assaulted your gaffer's wife.

42
00:01:55,985 --> 00:01:58,424
He'll make sure I go down,
there's no two ways about it.

43
00:01:58,425 --> 00:01:59,744
Lee Banks?

44
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,304
- Who the hell are you?
- Superintendent Hastings.

45
00:02:02,305 --> 00:02:04,860
Trust me, you'll be glad you did.

46
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:14,264
You're a rat, John.

47
00:02:14,265 --> 00:02:15,545
A rat.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

49
00:02:25,465 --> 00:02:28,345
OK, now cover it up with all
this stuff. Come on.

50
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:32,220
I feel terrible.

51
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,011
I never asked you how your exams went.

52
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,759
Yeah, fine.

53
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,988
Great.

54
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:41,100
Yeah. I got a date for my interview.

55
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,419
Ryan here's got a date for his interview.

56
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,420
Yeah?

57
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,099
Smart boy.

58
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,499
Guess you're going to have to lie
low from now on.

59
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,940
Shit.

60
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,060
I'm going to miss all this fun.

61
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,420
- Cheers, Tatleen.
- Ma'am. Sarge.

62
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,499
I've traced details
of John Corbett's parents.

63
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,139
Corbett's birth name was John McGillis.

64
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,059
His father, Anthony Patrick
McGillis, was the victim of a

65
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,373
paramilitary murder in 1984 when
John was five years old.

66
00:03:25,374 --> 00:03:27,339
His mother, Anne-Marie McGillis,

67
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,681
continued to live with John in Belfast.

68
00:03:29,682 --> 00:03:33,499
In 1989, Anne-Marie disappeared,
believed to have been kidnapped.

69
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,563
Her remains weren't found until 2001.

70
00:03:36,564 --> 00:03:39,091
There was a forensic
investigation of the scene and body,

71
00:03:39,092 --> 00:03:40,899
but the case is unsolved.

72
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,449
Do we know why she was kidnapped?

73
00:03:42,474 --> 00:03:45,286
According to files
held at the time by the Royal Ulster

74
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:49,318
Constabulary, Anne-Marie was
accused of being a police informant.

75
00:03:49,346 --> 00:03:52,620
This is the postmortem report from 2001.

76
00:03:53,592 --> 00:03:56,716
Before she was executed with
a single gunshot to the head,

77
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:58,580
Anne-Marie McGillis had been tortured.

78
00:03:59,712 --> 00:04:01,022
The postmortem detected

79
00:04:01,047 --> 00:04:04,615
gunshot wounds to the wrists,
knees and ankles.

80
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,519
The same injuries as Roisin.

81
00:04:06,544 --> 00:04:08,133
Cheers, Tatleen, we'll take it from here.

82
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:10,700
- Strictly 10-8 on this.
- Ma'am.

83
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,460
Sarge.

84
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,740
In 1989, Hastings was a PC in the RUC.

85
00:04:32,232 --> 00:04:33,997
When he passed the sergeants' exam,

86
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:36,180
he chose to transfer over
here on promotion.

87
00:04:36,989 --> 00:04:39,188
There's nothing on his record
refers to him

88
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:41,220
investigating the disappearance
of Anne-Marie McGillis.

89
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:44,988
There's a reference to
prolonged sick leave.

90
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:46,752
The only story the Gaffer ever told me

91
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:50,468
about those days was about getting
seriously injured by a pipe bomb.

92
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:52,792
Significant that should happen
shortly after

93
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,700
- Anne-Marie McGillis disappeared.
- Yeah.

94
00:05:00,824 --> 00:05:03,543
Ted.

95
00:05:03,568 --> 00:05:04,888
Ma'am.

96
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,189
Superintendent Hastings, I was very
sorry to hear about the assault

97
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,426
on your wife. I hope she's making a
speedy recovery.

98
00:05:18,427 --> 00:05:20,233
Yes, she is. Thank you.

99
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:22,691
I want to be transparent on police
corruption.

100
00:05:22,692 --> 00:05:24,996
The public needs to know
we're investigating

101
00:05:24,997 --> 00:05:29,105
institutionalised complicity between
the police and organised crime.

102
00:05:29,106 --> 00:05:30,966
Alleged complicity.

103
00:05:30,967 --> 00:05:34,064
And the lack of progress puts me
in an invidious position.

104
00:05:34,065 --> 00:05:37,459
It's better anti-corruption doesn't
exist than it's seen to fail.

105
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,390
I'm being strongly advised to
suppress the truth.

106
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,071
The truth?

107
00:05:43,072 --> 00:05:44,940
That corrupt officers are winning.

108
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,069
Hang on a minute.

109
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,470
It's hard enough catching criminals,
never mind bent coppers.

110
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:50,910
Andrea.

111
00:05:50,911 --> 00:05:54,749
Ted, you'll receive written
notification, AC-12's authority

112
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,830
to investigate Operation Pear Tree
has been rescinded.

113
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,095
You're taking us off the case, ma'am?

114
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:04,721
I've asked Detective Chief
Superintendent Carmichael to

115
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:07,175
drop in later.
I haven't told her the reason yet.

116
00:06:07,176 --> 00:06:09,895
My team just need a little bit
more time, ma'am.

117
00:06:09,896 --> 00:06:11,695
You've had your time.

118
00:06:12,035 --> 00:06:13,595
Thank you, Ted.

119
00:06:16,796 --> 00:06:18,220
Ma'am.

120
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,975
This is a complete mess.

121
00:06:24,976 --> 00:06:26,695
Of your own making.

122
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,095
Rohan, no-one wants to lie.

123
00:06:29,096 --> 00:06:31,455
But part of our duty is to
uphold public trust,

124
00:06:31,456 --> 00:06:33,175
and sometimes that means having

125
00:06:33,176 --> 00:06:35,736
a non-exclusive relationship
with the truth.

126
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:05,200
We've made repeated
attempts to contact the OCG

127
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:06,695
using text communication to their laptop.

128
00:07:06,696 --> 00:07:09,215
So far, our messages haven't
been returned.

129
00:07:09,216 --> 00:07:11,455
Maybe they've rumbled the impersonation.

130
00:07:11,456 --> 00:07:12,815
Yes, that's possible.

131
00:07:12,816 --> 00:07:15,455
As you know, we've been able to
identify Corbett's burner

132
00:07:15,456 --> 00:07:18,575
phone on the targeted surveillance
of his wife's communications.

133
00:07:18,576 --> 00:07:21,055
We've been making good
progress in harvesting

134
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:23,295
the metadata from his service provider.

135
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,575
Here's a map created from historical
metadata on the phone's positions.

136
00:07:27,576 --> 00:07:31,333
The hot spots represent habitual
locations we already detected,

137
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:34,420
such as his apartment
and Kingsgate Printing Services.

138
00:07:43,816 --> 00:07:46,335
We've been moving on to analyse
lukewarm spots

139
00:07:46,336 --> 00:07:48,215
and some have been reconnoitred.

140
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:51,187
We identified a nightclub
in the Kingsgate area.

141
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:53,775
Sir.

142
00:07:53,776 --> 00:07:58,220
Sir. I've been thinking about this
nightclub.

143
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,215
Well, I do read the reports.

144
00:08:01,216 --> 00:08:05,020
Meet me downstairs. I've got a plan
of how we're going to proceed.

145
00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:10,130
Thanks.

146
00:08:10,515 --> 00:08:11,580
Ma'am.

147
00:08:18,343 --> 00:08:19,663
Sir.

148
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,655
Sir, with respect,

149
00:08:22,656 --> 00:08:25,820
we need to consider exactly what it
is we're trying to achieve here.

150
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,020
I'm banking that
Corbett is going to attempt some

151
00:08:37,021 --> 00:08:39,495
kind of authentication at this point.

152
00:08:39,496 --> 00:08:42,503
This nightclub seems to be
their current hideaway.

153
00:08:42,504 --> 00:08:45,531
If we look at burner phone activity
here, at this location,

154
00:08:45,532 --> 00:08:47,800
then the second that Corbett
or one of his wee mates

155
00:08:47,825 --> 00:08:50,170
tries to contact the nominals
further up the chain,

156
00:08:50,171 --> 00:08:51,820
then we'll have a trail to the top man.

157
00:09:00,336 --> 00:09:02,336
Oh, here we go.

158
00:09:02,766 --> 00:09:04,235
_

159
00:09:04,236 --> 00:09:05,611
_

160
00:09:05,636 --> 00:09:06,927
They're challenging us to name

161
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:08,580
the meeting at the Palisades
Shopping Centre.

162
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,695
They normally use audio.

163
00:09:10,696 --> 00:09:12,455
What's going on?

164
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:14,981
We don't even know if this is
Corbett at the other end.

165
00:09:14,982 --> 00:09:17,960
It's an unknown user
with a new IP address,

166
00:09:17,961 --> 00:09:20,901
but they can achieve that using
a new dongle on their computer.

167
00:09:20,902 --> 00:09:23,341
Right. OK.

168
00:09:30,942 --> 00:09:32,513
_

169
00:09:32,553 --> 00:09:33,917
_

170
00:09:33,942 --> 00:09:36,781
Referencing the Palisades
meeting is an approved

171
00:09:36,782 --> 00:09:38,660
element of our pre-agreed responses.

172
00:09:42,428 --> 00:09:43,868
OK.

173
00:09:49,952 --> 00:09:51,952
_

174
00:09:53,782 --> 00:09:55,941
OK, so H was a no-show at the meeting.

175
00:09:55,942 --> 00:09:57,682
He may have spotted our surveillance,

176
00:09:57,683 --> 00:10:00,661
but I'm backing us to be too clever
to allow that to happen.

177
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,300
I'm going to take a gamble that he
was in the dark about it.

178
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:10,882
Here we go.

179
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:12,786
_

180
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:16,101
Bang! Now we're cooking with gas!
What next?

181
00:10:16,102 --> 00:10:19,452
Our preferred option is to request
information on the whereabouts

182
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:20,982
of the stolen goods.

183
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:33,031
_

184
00:10:52,135 --> 00:10:53,535
Christ's sake.

185
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,403
The Gaffer can't authorise
an undercover op

186
00:10:56,404 --> 00:10:58,550
and be the UCO at the same time.

187
00:10:58,551 --> 00:11:00,580
There's no independent decision-making.

188
00:11:01,151 --> 00:11:02,790
Is he even trained in undercover?

189
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,111
God knows.

190
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,750
I'm going to have to report this.

191
00:11:15,104 --> 00:11:16,623
Kate, wait.

192
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,430
Steve, regs are regs.

193
00:11:19,431 --> 00:11:21,976
We don't get to decide which ones
we like and which ones we don't.

194
00:11:21,977 --> 00:11:23,510
The Gaffer knows that.

195
00:11:23,511 --> 00:11:26,190
When my undercover was questioned,
he backed me.

196
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,580
Look, I know he's going through a lot.

197
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,950
I'll talk to him.

198
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:32,870
- I'll come with you.
- No.

199
00:11:32,871 --> 00:11:34,351
I'm the DI.

200
00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:41,353
Yes?

201
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,870
Sir.

202
00:11:43,298 --> 00:11:44,778
Kate.

203
00:11:46,631 --> 00:11:50,150
Sir, I honestly don't believe it's
lawful for the same senior officer

204
00:11:50,151 --> 00:11:53,350
to sanction an undercover operation
and carry it out without consulting

205
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:56,864
the head of the Covert Unit or some
other independent officer.

206
00:11:56,865 --> 00:11:59,950
I also believe that whoever's TFC
on this will not be able to

207
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:01,500
guarantee your safety.

208
00:12:01,911 --> 00:12:04,350
I recommend we commence
a covert surveillance

209
00:12:04,351 --> 00:12:06,806
operation on the nightclub
with a view to apprehending

210
00:12:06,807 --> 00:12:09,710
Corbett, McQueen and any other
OCG nominal detected.

211
00:12:10,404 --> 00:12:11,524
Sir.

212
00:12:15,531 --> 00:12:16,860
OK.

213
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,790
Sir?

214
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:25,860
OK. Start the surveillance.

215
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:33,910
Sir, is there something you're
not telling us?

216
00:12:34,484 --> 00:12:36,084
No.

217
00:12:38,251 --> 00:12:39,931
Thank you, sir.

218
00:12:54,936 --> 00:12:56,455
Welcome to the messaging

219
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,205
service for Mark Moffatt,
Kettle Bell Property Partners.

220
00:12:59,206 --> 00:13:00,991
No-one is available...

221
00:13:17,018 --> 00:13:19,218
- All right, Kyle?
- Steve.

222
00:13:20,271 --> 00:13:23,990
No sign yet of Corbett.
Looking like a quiet night so far.

223
00:13:23,991 --> 00:13:26,760
Ideally we want to strike
when they're all there

224
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:28,910
Corbett, McQueen, Minkowicz and the rest.

225
00:13:28,911 --> 00:13:30,510
But Corbett's the priority.

226
00:13:30,511 --> 00:13:31,740
All right?

227
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,270
Call me when he's sighted.

228
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,070
Off somewhere nice?

229
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:37,470
Might be.

230
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:38,910
Cheeky bastard.

231
00:13:38,911 --> 00:13:41,511
- Bring pizza next time.
- See you.

232
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,610
I'm glad you called.

233
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,110
I was worried you'd still be
pissed off with me.

234
00:13:54,111 --> 00:13:55,830
Who says I'm not?

235
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,910
Just cos you've got bumfluff
all over your face doesn't mean

236
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,470
- you have to be an arse.
- You can borrow my razor any time.

237
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,030
Oi!

238
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,159
How's it going at work?

239
00:14:06,718 --> 00:14:08,798
Weird is how it's going.

240
00:14:09,831 --> 00:14:11,910
We've got an Acting DCS and she's great,

241
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,660
but everyone's still
talking about Hargreaves.

242
00:14:16,307 --> 00:14:17,626
Looking back.

243
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:20,140
- Were there any signs?
- Yeah.

244
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:25,013
Are AC-12 opening an investigation
into the whole of Serious Crime,

245
00:14:25,014 --> 00:14:26,728
seeing if we were all in on it?

246
00:14:26,729 --> 00:14:28,831
We haven't got the manpower.

247
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,098
Sorry.

248
00:14:37,271 --> 00:14:38,540
No.

249
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:40,150
There weren't any signs.

250
00:14:40,151 --> 00:14:41,340
I wish there were.

251
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,591
I guess there never are till
it's too late.

252
00:14:47,998 --> 00:14:49,518
Want another?

253
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,190
It's up to you.

254
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,820
I'm fine.

255
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,711
I'm not, by the way,
pissed off with you any more.

256
00:15:01,091 --> 00:15:02,491
Good.

257
00:15:03,898 --> 00:15:05,458
Good.

258
00:15:13,957 --> 00:15:15,797
You coming?

259
00:15:36,461 --> 00:15:37,812
Something wrong?

260
00:15:38,685 --> 00:15:40,085
It's fine.

261
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,931
Stop.

262
00:16:04,177 --> 00:16:05,497
Stop.

263
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:13,897
Give me a minute.

264
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:19,471
Steve, don't worry, it's not a problem.

265
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,260
- Steve.
- I won't be a minute.

266
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,180
Maybe there's just too much going
on with work or something.

267
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,590
Or maybe it's something
to do with your back.

268
00:16:43,591 --> 00:16:45,500
You hurt it really badly.

269
00:17:48,724 --> 00:17:50,244
Shit.

270
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:24,670
Can I help you, sir?

271
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:27,300
A bit of a quiet night.
Business on the slide?

272
00:18:28,957 --> 00:18:30,477
Our business is fine.

273
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:32,864
What's yours?

274
00:18:38,631 --> 00:18:41,260
John Clayton about?
I'd like to speak to him.

275
00:18:47,311 --> 00:18:49,332
- Wait here, sir.
- Clayton, mind.

276
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,151
I don't want to talk to anybody else.

277
00:19:03,671 --> 00:19:07,030
Hey, Lis. Copper looking for John.

278
00:19:07,031 --> 00:19:08,511
Who?

279
00:19:14,511 --> 00:19:16,110
This one.

280
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:17,910
- Did he show ID?
- Mm-hm.

281
00:19:17,911 --> 00:19:20,020
Superintendent Hastings.

282
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:22,737
Hastings.

283
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:26,945
H.

284
00:19:27,878 --> 00:19:29,318
He said he'd come.

285
00:19:37,231 --> 00:19:39,110
The Gaffer went in
about half an hour ago.

286
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,550
No sign of him coming out.

287
00:19:40,551 --> 00:19:42,310
- Corbett?
- Still unsighted,

288
00:19:42,311 --> 00:19:44,991
but McQueen and Minkowicz
entered earlier tonight.

289
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,030
God knows what the Gaffer's playing at.

290
00:19:49,031 --> 00:19:53,712
So, er, this Eastfield job, that was
Clayton's bright idea, wasn't it?

291
00:19:53,737 --> 00:19:55,337
Where is he?

292
00:20:02,231 --> 00:20:03,620
Lisa.

293
00:20:04,398 --> 00:20:06,118
We need to take some precautions.

294
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,470
Well, I was just, erm,

295
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:14,470
talking to Miroslav here.

296
00:20:14,818 --> 00:20:16,258
Where's Clayton?

297
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,030
John's lying low.

298
00:20:20,031 --> 00:20:23,140
- The situation got too hot for him.
- Oh, right.

299
00:20:23,951 --> 00:20:27,310
Well, look, I need to talk to him
cos this is business.

300
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:30,270
- Talk to me.
- Oh...

301
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,470
Well, these Eastfield goods
are going to be difficult

302
00:20:32,471 --> 00:20:34,070
to get out the country, you know?

303
00:20:34,071 --> 00:20:35,990
We're all looking for a payday, right?

304
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,030
Every cop in three counties is
going to be looking for the goods,

305
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:41,630
so we've got to find a way of
throwing them off the scent.

306
00:20:41,631 --> 00:20:43,550
What better way to grease the wheels

307
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:45,630
to get the head of anti-corruption...

308
00:20:45,631 --> 00:20:48,150
...who knows every bent cop going?

309
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,270
You need to be more than that.

310
00:20:51,598 --> 00:20:52,798
What about H?

311
00:20:54,104 --> 00:20:55,504
If you want to use that term.

312
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,270
How come you're showing your face?

313
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:06,390
How come you're here on your own,
no crew backing you up?

314
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,110
There's no time.

315
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:09,990
This needs to happen fast.

316
00:21:09,991 --> 00:21:11,950
And this is between us.

317
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:13,940
We're doing things my way.

318
00:21:19,631 --> 00:21:20,951
We'll take no chances.

319
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,390
- I'd really rather you didn't.
- Don't make this harder.

320
00:21:27,391 --> 00:21:29,300
No disrespect intended.

321
00:21:31,655 --> 00:21:33,030
Armed police! Do not move!

322
00:21:33,031 --> 00:21:35,110
Do not move!

323
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:37,913
- Stay where you are!
- Get down! Get down!

324
00:21:37,938 --> 00:21:39,470
Don't move!

325
00:21:39,471 --> 00:21:41,430
Don't move! Show me your hands!

326
00:21:41,431 --> 00:21:43,150
Stay there!

327
00:21:43,151 --> 00:21:46,100
Don't move! Stay there!

328
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:51,896
- Six Four, urgent message.
- Four Five.

329
00:21:51,897 --> 00:21:53,309
No visual with the Gaffer.

330
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:54,568
Searching premises.

331
00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:56,630
Unarmed stay out till secure.

332
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,350
Received.

333
00:22:22,157 --> 00:22:23,317
All right.

334
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,190
No.

335
00:22:29,191 --> 00:22:31,310
Keep him in the car for a while.

336
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,790
Let's wait and see if
he's being followed, yeah?

337
00:22:34,085 --> 00:22:35,525
Well, what if he is?

338
00:22:56,804 --> 00:22:57,964
Boss.

339
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:08,919
What happened?

340
00:23:08,944 --> 00:23:10,390
There's a door into
the adjoining building

341
00:23:10,391 --> 00:23:12,870
leading to an exit we didn't have
under surveillance.

342
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,630
I'm sorry, boss.

343
00:23:14,631 --> 00:23:15,950
It's not your fault, mate.

344
00:23:15,951 --> 00:23:18,340
This is why I told the Gaffer
not to do this.

345
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,273
Well, now I know why. The paperwork
came through from the DCC's office.

346
00:23:22,274 --> 00:23:24,747
- We got taken off the case this morning.
- Shit.

347
00:23:24,748 --> 00:23:26,599
Is there any other leads on
where they're taking him?

348
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,790
An all-units bulletin's been on
the air for half an hour already,

349
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:30,550
circulated to neighbouring forces.

350
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,510
No obs reported.

351
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,031
Christ.

352
00:23:52,991 --> 00:23:54,551
Well...

353
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,750
...Clayton wasn't lying,
this really is...

354
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,460
...some haul.

355
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,910
Is he here?

356
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,070
Told you, he's lying low.

357
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,790
Yeah, right. Well, I need him
on the inside.

358
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,070
I don't need him banging
around like some loose cannon,

359
00:24:12,071 --> 00:24:14,680
- ready to blow the gaff.
- What's your plan?

360
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,790
Well, notices will have been
sent out to the port authorities

361
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:22,110
and the border agencies,
so I think our best option

362
00:24:22,111 --> 00:24:25,702
is to fly this stuff out
through some private airport

363
00:24:25,703 --> 00:24:26,910
with slack security.

364
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,550
I mean...

365
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:31,054
...there's a hell of a lot of cargo here,

366
00:24:31,055 --> 00:24:32,277
it's going to take a couple of flights.

367
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:33,910
I think we should start with the drugs

368
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,119
cos they'll be the easiest got rid of,

369
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,999
- and we can use the Spanish connection.
- What airfield?

370
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,159
Well, that'd be Green Hill Aerodrome.

371
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,519
At the minute, we're investigating
a number of drug squad officers

372
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,399
who are under suspicion
for smuggling contraband

373
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,054
and it seems that Green Hill Aerodrome

374
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:51,778
is their preferred route out.

375
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:53,518
So that's why we have to move fast

376
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:55,359
because there's only a small
window of opportunity

377
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,319
before the surveillance starts on Monday.

378
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,119
So, first flight tomorrow night,
two or three more after that,

379
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,740
we get the whole thing wrapped
up by the weekend. What do you say?

380
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,599
I just... I don't believe
that H would show up on his own.

381
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,079
Oh, right. OK.

382
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,839
So now I get why Clayton
ended up bossing this unit,

383
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,559
because he would not have
the temerity to piss me off.

384
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,199
Now you find out where Clayton is,

385
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,660
get him in here, so I can
have a proper conversation.

386
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:35,420
What are you going to do, Lisa?

387
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,540
Lisa?

388
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,959
It's the cops!

389
00:25:52,123 --> 00:25:53,606
Armed police!

390
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,519
Stay where you are.

391
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,039
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
- Hands where I can see them!

392
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,639
Hands where I can see them!

393
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,439
It's all right.
We're all cooperating, fella.

394
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,079
Six Four, scene secured. Two under
control, unarmed clear to enter.

395
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,203
You crossed us.

396
00:26:08,228 --> 00:26:09,562
- Not me. Not me.
- Shut up!

397
00:26:09,563 --> 00:26:12,199
Control to unarmed Bronze.
All unarmed to move forward.

398
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,267
Repeat, all unarmed to move forward.

399
00:26:14,268 --> 00:26:17,919
- Search her.
- Six Four, One GSW, ambulance required.

400
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,749
Control received.
One subject down with GSW.

401
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:25,058
I'm arresting you on suspicion of
Conspiracy to Commit Armed Robbery.

402
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:28,279
It may harm your defence if you
do not mention, when questioned,

403
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,079
something you later rely on in court.

404
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,380
Anything you do say
may be used in evidence.

405
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,200
There's no keeping this quiet.

406
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,740
Alpha Charlie Four Five, two in custody.

407
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,040
Sir.

408
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,253
- Sir.
- I was hoping you two guys

409
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:40,399
would save my bacon.

410
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,119
How did you manage it?

411
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,719
We exploited the contact numbers
from Corbett's burner.

412
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,399
One of these was pinged at the nightclub

413
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,479
and a live trace led us out of town.

414
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,639
The phone was found on
Miroslav Minkowicz's body.

415
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,919
Great work. And thanks for keeping
up the pretence in front of McQueen.

416
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,559
She is our best chance of
bringing Corbett in.

417
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,399
You'll appreciate, sir, we do
need to ask you a few questions.

418
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,740
Yeah, well, let me save you the trouble.

419
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,479
DCC Wise, she took us off the case.

420
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,479
It could have been the end of AC-12.

421
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,919
Look, I'm sorry that I didn't bring
you in on what I was planning,

422
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,439
but it was the only way.

423
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,719
Unfortunately, Corbett has
gone to ground,

424
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,399
but my hunch is he will be back
sooner rather than later

425
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,759
with his tail between his legs.

426
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,839
But right now, you know what? I'll
give you a statement in the morning.

427
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,959
I just want to get home.

428
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,920
Sir, you should remain here
for your own protection.

429
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,479
I just want... I just want to get home.

430
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,559
Stick a couple of AFOs outside the door.

431
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,319
Sir, if the OCG finds out you're not
in custody, it poses a serious and

432
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,860
credible threat to an investigation
we've all worked so hard for.

433
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,260
We need to maintain the pretence.

434
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,559
Yeah.

435
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,940
Yeah, OK. Yeah. OK.

436
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,520
- Sir.
- Sir.

437
00:29:35,466 --> 00:29:37,226
Ah. I thought you'd be in bed.

438
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,359
I was worried sick.

439
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,840
I didn't get a chance to call.

440
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,380
You said your promotion
meant better hours.

441
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,860
You could be a mum as well
as a police officer.

442
00:29:54,733 --> 00:29:57,212
Thanks for making me feel like shit.

443
00:29:57,237 --> 00:29:58,677
Nice one.

444
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,120
Alpha Charlie Six One.
Corridor secure, clear to approach.

445
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,919
Did you participate in, or are you
able to provide any information,

446
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,839
on the following offences?

447
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,959
The hijack of Transport ED-905
on the 15th of February 2019,

448
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,879
the hijack of ballistics transport BC-556

449
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,000
on the 27th of February 2019

450
00:30:38,025 --> 00:30:40,159
and the armed robbery
of the Eastfield Depot

451
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,839
on the 5th of March 2019?

452
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:44,373
No comment.

453
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,759
The murders of PC Ray Randhawa,
PC Kevin Greysham

454
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,639
and PC Carl Waldhouse
on the 15th of February 2019

455
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,759
and the attempted murder of
PS Jane Cafferty on the same date?

456
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,159
No comment.

457
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,940
The murder of PC Maneet Bindra on
or before the 23rd of February 2019?

458
00:31:02,713 --> 00:31:03,953
No comment.

459
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,439
The murder of Detective Chief
Superintendent Lester Hargreaves

460
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,599
on the 5th of March 2019?

461
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,919
No comment.

462
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,839
Lisa, we've got a mass of evidence
on the organised crime group

463
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,799
you're a member of.
From the nightclub office,

464
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,279
forensic investigators
recovered a laptop computer

465
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,999
with your fingerprints
all over the keyboard.

466
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,460
If convicted, you'll spend the best
years of your life in prison.

467
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,480
But there is an alternative.

468
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,399
Our side of the inquiry is
the corrupt police officers

469
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,420
who've colluded in these offences.

470
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,600
We need your help with that.

471
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,440
Witness protection.

472
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,679
Immunity.

473
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,039
Provided you're not ineligible

474
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,460
due to committing the most
serious offences.

475
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,340
Did you participate in any of
the murders listed by DI Fleming?

476
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,080
No.

477
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,540
We'll still need to look into that,
of course.

478
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,119
We require information on
the higher echelons

479
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,640
of the organised crime group.

480
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,520
You're asking a lot.

481
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,040
I need to think about that.

482
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,760
There is one individual we're
particularly interested in.

483
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,000
Do you recognise the code name H?

484
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,960
Is your boss watching all this?

485
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,359
Superintendent Hastings is in custody,

486
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,060
under investigation for his links
with the OCG.

487
00:32:31,753 --> 00:32:32,993
Is he H?

488
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,919
Sorry.

489
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,320
No comment.

490
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,079
Lisa, it'd be great to have
something to prove

491
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,559
you're assisting the inquiry,

492
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,559
to get the ball rolling with
witness protection and immunity.

493
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,559
One piece of information
we require urgently

494
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,660
is the whereabouts of John Clayton.

495
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,679
I ain't seen him for at least
a couple of days.

496
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,279
Why not?

497
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,660
We got a tip-off that there was
a rat in the unit.

498
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,780
He must have lost his bottle.

499
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,880
Where'd the tip-off come from?

500
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,080
No names.

501
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,300
You'll have to find that out
for yourselves.

502
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,660
But it came from out of Blackthorn.

503
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,479
Maybe someone inside Blackthorn knew
about Corbett from another inmate.

504
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,759
Well, that's a long shot. Corbett
was brought in from Merseyside.

505
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,559
Ma'am, Sarge, Governor-authorised
police visits to Blackthorn Prison.

506
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,000
Cheers, Tatleen.

507
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,039
The Gaffer made a visit
on the 12th of March.

508
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:57,260
To Lee Banks,
the only current OCG member inside.

509
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,660
Christ.

510
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,799
Well, it's there, in black and white.

511
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,999
The Gaffer found out that
Corbett was the one

512
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,879
responsible for assaulting his wife.
He goes to visit Lee Banks.

513
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,719
Lee Banks passes on a message to
the OCG that there's an undercover

514
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,279
officer in their ranks.

515
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,999
I mean, obviously we don't know
that's exactly how it happened,

516
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,400
but... No, we don't.

517
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,780
- Well...
- You know what I've got to do.

518
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,840
You've got no choice, mate.

519
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,360
Thanks, Steve.

520
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,800
Well, as for Corbett, let's hope
he went to ground in time.

521
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,239
The number you have
dialled is not available.

522
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,440
Please record your message
after the tone.

523
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,180
John, if you get this...

524
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,879
...you're in danger.

525
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,799
I think your cover's been compromised.

526
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,439
You've gotta come in. I promise you,
you'll be treated fairly.

527
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,519
I'll do everything I can so you can
give your side of the story.

528
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,620
Just come in, mate, before it's too late.

529
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,559
- DI Fleming, ma'am.
- DS Arnott, ma'am.

530
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,919
I've asked DI Randall to take notes.

531
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,719
I've been advised you want
to discuss a sensitive matter

532
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,540
relating to AC-12's investigation
into Operation Pear Tree.

533
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,880
I don't do this lightly, ma'am.

534
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,319
It relates to
Superintendent Hastings, ma'am.

535
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,239
I've a number of concerns regarding
his recent professional conduct.

536
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,639
Specifically, there was
a potentially unlawful

537
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,519
Fahrenheit order given to DS Arnott
and the recovery of the stolen goods

538
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,719
involved an unauthorised
undercover operation.

539
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,220
God's sake!

540
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,263
Ma'am, we've also detected
circumstantial evidence

541
00:36:08,264 --> 00:36:10,519
that Superintendent Hastings
may have deliberately

542
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,260
blown John Corbett's cover.

543
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,580
My God.

544
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,759
Has Corbett been able to reach
a place of safety?

545
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,039
We don't know yet, ma'am.

546
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,119
We're conducting urgent inquiries,
ma'am, in an effort to locate him.

547
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,959
Given what you've disclosed,
I've got no choice but to order

548
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,080
an outside investigation
into Superintendent Hastings.

549
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,159
Yes, ma'am. We understand.

550
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,839
Where is he now?

551
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,860
We're housing him, ma'am, at AC-12.

552
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,679
- Very sorry, sir.
- Oh!

553
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,719
- Thank you.
- Ah, Gill.

554
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,256
What are you doing in here?

555
00:36:48,257 --> 00:36:53,399
Yeah, well, this is my gambit to get
the OCG nominal talking.

556
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,599
Meanwhile, I'm cooped up in here
going off my trolley.

557
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,879
So good news, I think, yeah?

558
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,039
You know, we managed to
neutralise the OCG,

559
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,839
get the loot back from the Eastfield job,

560
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:05,159
so should be back in the DCC's
good books, I'd say.

561
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,519
Sorry, Ted. The opposite.

562
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,279
There's been some extremely serious
allegations,

563
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,740
which need to be thoroughly investigated.

564
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,300
What kind of allegations?

565
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,340
I'm not at liberty to say.

566
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,079
I know I'm playing a bit fast
and loose at the moment,

567
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,359
but my team'll back me up,
they always do.

568
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,940
Not always.

569
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,951
No. I-I don't believe you. Name them.

570
00:37:31,952 --> 00:37:33,919
The officer, or officers,
concerned have the right

571
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,220
for their allegations to be handled
in strictest confidence.

572
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,719
Mother of God.

573
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,999
My own team?

574
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,559
I'm here as a concerned colleague
to offer my sincere advice

575
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,479
on how to avoid an embarrassing
finish to a distinguished career.

576
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,719
Now, we need to move fast.

577
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,439
Retirement will put you out of reach
of disciplinary procedures.

578
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,367
There's such a thing
as reputation, you know?

579
00:37:56,368 --> 00:37:58,639
What are these allegations?
I'll fight them, just you watch!

580
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,079
Who's leading the investigation?

581
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,279
An outside unit with an
anti-corruption SIO at least

582
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,039
one rank senior to you.

583
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:08,239
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Not Patricia bloody Carmichael.

584
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,199
That one has been fast-tracked
from day one.

585
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,279
She hasn't put in the same years
as the rest of us mere mortals.

586
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,519
I tell you, she'll see my scalp as a
step up the ladder, believe you me.

587
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,679
Look, Ted, I can help you.

588
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,359
I used to be a defence solicitor,
a bloody good one.

589
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,460
No, that's all right, Gill. I'll
make my own arrangements, thank you.

590
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,639
Well, you're your own man,
Ted, you always have been.

591
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,760
But don't say that I didn't try...

592
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,880
...which is why I wanted to be
the one to notify you.

593
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,359
Notify me?

594
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:40,159
This is a standard letter which will
accompany the Regulation 15 Notice.

595
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,340
You're being suspended from duty.

596
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,360
I'm really sorry, Ted.

597
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,159
Sir? Sir, you're not meant
to leave the building

598
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,799
without DI Fleming's permission.

599
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,959
Kate and Steve aren't in the building,
otherwise they'd have to answer to me.

600
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,759
You tell them to get their stories
straight by the time I get back.

601
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,479
But, sir, I'm under orders
to stop you leaving AC-12.

602
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,895
Am I under arrest?

603
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,544
- Uh, no, sir.
- Precisely.

604
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,679
No. No, there's no sign of him.

605
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,279
Ma'am, he's just arrived. Ma'am.

606
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,239
What the hell's going on here?

607
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,999
- Superintendent Hastings?
- Yeah.

608
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,159
DI Michelle Brandyce, AC-3.

609
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,919
Are you going to tell me what's going on?

610
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,519
Sir, Detective Chief Superintendent
Carmichael asked me to

611
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,519
keep track of your movements. I was
informed you'd absconded from AC-12.

612
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,319
"Absconded"? Well, that's rich. Now,
I'd just like to get to my room,

613
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,439
if it's all the same to you.

614
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,959
Sir, may I ask what's the purpose
of your visit here?

615
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,479
A hot bath and a change of clothes,
for Christ's sake!

616
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,999
Right, Constable, stand aside.

617
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,999
Sir, we've made arrangements
to question you.

618
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,079
Could I please ask you to accompany
me to Decker Avenue Police Station?

619
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,719
Between you and me and the gatepost,
DI Brandyce,

620
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,239
my patience is wearing a bit thin.

621
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,519
Right, Constable.
Stand aside, that's an order.

622
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,919
Sir, I've asked you politely
to come to Decker Avenue.

623
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,799
Yeah. And I politely declined.

624
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,319
In that case, sir, you give me
no choice but to arrest you.

625
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,799
On what grounds?

626
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,079
As I'm sure you know, sir, under
the Police and Criminal Evidence Act

627
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:28,439
1984, Code G, Subsection 2.9, I have
the lawful power to arrest you

628
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,639
to further the prompt and effective
investigation of an offence.

629
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,639
What offence?
Wanting to get in to my room

630
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,908
to get a clean set of clothes?

631
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,519
Sir, I strongly recommend you cooperate.

632
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,380
Yeah, well, state the offence.

633
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,999
Edward Hastings,

634
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,519
you are under arrest on suspicion
of misconduct in a public office.

635
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,039
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

636
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,719
if you do not mention, when questioned,
something you later rely on in court.

637
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,100
Anything you do say may be
used in evidence.

638
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,800
DS Arnott.

639
00:41:24,499 --> 00:41:25,539
Thanks.

640
00:41:26,913 --> 00:41:29,233
- You all right?
- All right.

641
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,759
It's usually you Sam calls.
Everything all right with you two?

642
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,119
Not really.

643
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,839
That's a shame. I thought
you were getting back together.

644
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,319
We're not.

645
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,160
Sorry, mate.

646
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,959
Thanks for the call.

647
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,680
- You all right?
- All right.

648
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,559
Workmen were processing this scrap

649
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,039
when they accidentally
disturbed the body bag.

650
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,039
We've examined CCTV

651
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,040
and an OCG vehicle was seen in
the immediate vicinity.

652
00:42:00,673 --> 00:42:01,873
Open it up.

653
00:42:03,393 --> 00:42:05,753
I'm going to cut into
the seal of the bag.

654
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,519
- If this is Corbett...
- Yeah.

655
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,720
Take pictures of each stage
of the process.

656
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,300
There is a strong smell
from inside the bag.

657
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,400
I can see various evidence
of dismemberment.

658
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,479
Jesus Christ.

659
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,160
No, it's OK. You carry on.

660
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,760
- You OK, mate?
- No.

661
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,200
I'm sorry.

662
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,880
No way he deserved that.

663
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,879
What if he did blow Corbett's cover?

664
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,400
Doesn't bear thinking about.

665
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,901
DCS Carmichael asked me
to pass on a message.

666
00:43:20,926 --> 00:43:21,999
Yeah?

667
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,839
Given the possible conflict of interest,

668
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,759
it protects all parties for you both
to stay out of the building.

669
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,520
If she needs you, we'll call you in.

670
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,260
Come on, mate.
There's nothing we can do here.

671
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,960
Thank you, as you were.

672
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,919
Anti-corruption Unit 3 interview
of Edward Hastings,

673
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,439
in the presence of his solicitor,

674
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,639
by Detective Chief
Superintendent Carmichael,

675
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,039
Detective Inspector Brandyce
and Police Sergeant Tranter,

676
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:44,639
at 17:30 on the 14th of March 2019.

677
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,479
For the DIR, can you please
identify yourself?

678
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,199
Superintendent Hastings.

679
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,940
You remain under caution.

680
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,759
Mr Hastings, what's your current
permanent residence?

681
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,780
My rank is Superintendent
and you will address me as such.

682
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,220
I'm very happy to address you
as Superintendent.

683
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,840
And in respect of your responses,
"ma'am" will suffice.

684
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,100
I do not have a permanent
residence, ma'am.

685
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,319
Why is that, Superintendent?

686
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,199
Well, because my wife and I
sold the house.

687
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,799
I am temporarily holed up in a hotel

688
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,719
whilst seeking a more
permanent accommodation.

689
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,559
And this would be
the Edge Park Hotel room?

690
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,839
Yes. Room 336.

691
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,559
Document four in your folders.

692
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:35,039
Document four relates to a search
of Room 336 at the Edge Park Hotel,

693
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,039
today, on the 14th of March.

694
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,119
PS Tranter will show you
image nine on screen.

695
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,079
If you prefer, you can refer
to your folder.

696
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,639
Image nine shows item reference MB-1.

697
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,799
Superintendent Hastings,
do you recognise item MB-1?

698
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,679
I do, ma'am.

699
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,580
Image ten on screen, please.

700
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,919
Image ten shows item reference MB-2.

701
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,119
Item reference MB-2 is
a collection of banknotes

702
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,380
in the value of £50,000.

703
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,359
Do you recognise item MB-2,
Superintendent Hastings?

704
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,799
I do, ma'am.

705
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,559
Can you account for this
substantial sum of cash?

706
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,679
I was in the process of returning
this cash to

707
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,039
Retired Detective
Chief Inspector Mark Moffatt.

708
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:14,239
Moffatt forwarded the cash to me
using false pretences.

709
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,999
DI Brandyce.

710
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,359
Document 24 in your folders,
statement given to PS Tranter

711
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,319
by Mark Moffatt today, the 14th of March.

712
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,039
In his statement, Mr Moffatt claims
he only provided further documents

713
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,079
relating to the Kettle Bell project
and nothing else.

714
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,119
Well, the man is a barefaced liar!

715
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,680
I can't bear shouting.

716
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,639
You really ought to try and be more calm.

717
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,079
Yeah, well, I'll be more calm when
I'm not listening to a pack of lies.

718
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,959
Did you even manage to check
the bank notes for fingerprints?

719
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,439
Funnily enough, I have run
an investigation before.

720
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,119
Moffatt provided elimination prints-

721
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,730
they weren't detected on the bank notes.

722
00:46:49,755 --> 00:46:50,999
He'd be too smart for that.

723
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,439
What about the envelope?

724
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,140
Prints were detected, but he doesn't
deny handling the envelope.

725
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,879
Said cash, why did you hold on to it?

726
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,180
As I said, I intended to return it.

727
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,882
"Intended"?

728
00:47:02,907 --> 00:47:04,719
Yeah, well, I didn't open the
package immediately, ma'am.

729
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,040
But the minute I spotted the cash,
I called Moffatt straight away.

730
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,319
How would you describe receiving
50 grand in a brown envelope

731
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,640
when you're the head
of an anti-corruption unit?

732
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,880
Suspicious.

733
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,460
Mm.

734
00:47:24,527 --> 00:47:26,447
There, you see, we're agreeing.

735
00:47:27,947 --> 00:47:29,620
This is much better, isn't it?

736
00:47:31,772 --> 00:47:33,092
"Suspicious."

737
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,399
Look, it was a complicated arrangement.

738
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,679
It was an advance on funds that was
due to me further down the line.

739
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,799
And the fact that it was in cash,
what did that make you think?

740
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,759
Like I said, it didn't sit right.

741
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,220
Possibly someone was trying
to hide the payment?

742
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,420
That's possible.

743
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,519
- DI Brandyce.
- Document 17 in your folders.

744
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,399
We've been given access to the accounts

745
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,119
of Kettle Bell Property Partners.

746
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:05,000
We are unable to detect the sum of
£50,000 credited to Edward Hastings.

747
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,480
Yeah, well, um...

748
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,479
Moffatt must have been
keeping it off the books.

749
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,719
Well, bearing in mind that's your
version of events, Superintendent,

750
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,919
Moffatt denies furnishing you
with the cash.

751
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,839
Yeah, and I told you the man's a liar!

752
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,879
My client is telling the truth.

753
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:25,479
He strenuously denies
Mr Moffatt's account.

754
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,719
Alternatively, hiding financial
transactions on that scale,

755
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,672
is that something you would normally do?

756
00:48:30,697 --> 00:48:31,904
Absolutely not.

757
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,839
DI Brandyce.

758
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:38,279
As part of our inquiry under police
developed vetting procedures,

759
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,759
we've been able to inspect

760
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,079
Superintendent Hastings'
financial records.

761
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,959
Documents 32 to 38 in your folders.

762
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:50,119
Now, in 2014, an allegation was made

763
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:54,519
by an officer under investigation
by AC-12, DI Lindsay Denton,

764
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,199
who had fraudulently obtained access

765
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,079
to Superintendent Hastings'
financial records.

766
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,399
At the time, Superintendent Hastings

767
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,639
answered the allegations in writing

768
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,439
and the inquiry was closed,

769
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,519
as Denton's evidence
had been obtained unlawfully.

770
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,039
No, no, no. It was because
there was no case to answer!

771
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,674
Our examination of your accounts
since 2014

772
00:49:13,675 --> 00:49:15,074
shows a pattern of increasing debts,

773
00:49:15,075 --> 00:49:17,439
each time rectified by the sale of
assets.

774
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,439
Is that why you sold the family
home, Superintendent?

775
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,479
I don't have to answer that question.

776
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,754
You don't really need to answer
any of these questions,

777
00:49:24,755 --> 00:49:27,080
but that's not going to help you, is it?

778
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:33,035
So far, we have £50,000
hidden in your hotel room

779
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:34,400
and a history of insolvency.

780
00:49:34,401 --> 00:49:36,559
I think it's in your best interest
to account for this,

781
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:41,719
otherwise... my imagination
might start running away with me.

782
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,759
I mean, there's lots of reasons why
a bloke might get into debt,

783
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,399
I hardly dare mention them.

784
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,820
Gambling.

785
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:50,639
Drink. Drugs.

786
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,157
Sex.

787
00:49:52,158 --> 00:49:54,239
Look, it was a bad investment.

788
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,679
You trust somebody.

789
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,399
All I was trying to do

790
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:02,180
was to secure a comfortable
retirement for myself and my wife.

791
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,479
I'm sorry to hear that...

792
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,848
...but it is your duty to
declare these losses.

793
00:50:07,849 --> 00:50:10,374
In your position, as head
of an anti-corruption unit,

794
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:12,067
you are uniquely vulnerable

795
00:50:12,068 --> 00:50:14,390
to attempts of
bribery and, or, blackmail.

796
00:50:14,391 --> 00:50:15,711
Agreed?

797
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,010
- Yes.
- There, you see?

798
00:50:19,011 --> 00:50:20,119
We're agreeing again.

799
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,100
This is how I like to work.

800
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,919
These proceedings
were initially triggered

801
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,879
by allegations of
professional misconduct,

802
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,239
let's move on to examine those.

803
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,639
I'd be most grateful if you would.

804
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,614
I'd like to look at your
professional activities

805
00:50:31,615 --> 00:50:33,119
on the 12th of March.

806
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,199
Have you had an opportunity to
review your diary for that day?

807
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,519
I have, ma'am.

808
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,359
- Please feel free to refer to it.
- Thank you.

809
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,599
Did you make a visit
to Blackthorn Prison?

810
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,919
I did.

811
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,679
What was the purpose of that visit?

812
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,346
To gather and harvest information on
the organised crime group

813
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:52,959
that we were in the process of
investigating.

814
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,399
We have a copy
of the Governor-authorised police

815
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,879
visit to Blackthorn Prison
on the 12th of March.

816
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,879
Is that your name recorded at 1700 hours?

817
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,159
Yes, ma'am, it is.

818
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,319
And who is recorded as
the prisoner that you visited?

819
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,559
That would be Lee Banks.

820
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,258
- Did you speak with Banks on the 12th?
- I did, ma'am.

821
00:51:09,259 --> 00:51:10,892
What was the content of that
conversation?

822
00:51:10,893 --> 00:51:13,799
Well, I questioned
Banks on the personnel of the OCG

823
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:17,399
and other details that might be
useful to our inquiry.

824
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,439
Was the conversation recorded?

825
00:51:20,106 --> 00:51:21,586
No, ma'am.

826
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,079
Was it witnessed?

827
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,600
No, ma'am.

828
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:41,319
PS Tranter interviewed Lee Banks.

829
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,599
Lee Banks refused to cooperate
in our inquiry

830
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,199
and answered "no comment"
to all the questions put to him.

831
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,279
There's no corroboration
of your statement,

832
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,536
Superintendent Hastings, is there?

833
00:51:49,537 --> 00:51:53,679
No, look,
Lee Banks is a hardened criminal.

834
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,879
It's like getting blood out of a stone.

835
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,599
He talked to you?

836
00:51:58,067 --> 00:51:59,707
- A little.
- Why?

837
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,639
What do you mean?

838
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,959
You just stated that Lee Banks
isn't very forthcoming.

839
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,160
What induced him to speak to you?

840
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,639
I am the superintendent of the team
that got him banged up

841
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,559
and put behind bars,
so, if he helps me with my inquiry,

842
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,714
I'll put a word in to the court

843
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:18,000
so they can take into account
his cooperation

844
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:19,119
when it comes to sentencing.

845
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:22,000
There really isn't anything very
clever about that.

846
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:26,559
But visiting a prisoner,
with no witness, no recording,

847
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,940
that is less clever.

848
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,520
For the DIR,
the interviewee is not responding.

849
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:45,079
What specifically did Banks
reveal to you about the OCG

850
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,159
that helped you with your inquiry?

851
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,547
Only that the shots were being
called by John Clayton,

852
00:52:50,548 --> 00:52:53,705
aka John Corbett, and one Lisa McQueen.

853
00:52:53,706 --> 00:52:55,239
Let's turn to Corbett and McQueen.

854
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,786
Your unit has been attempting,
without much success,

855
00:52:57,787 --> 00:53:00,279
it has to be said, to apprehend Corbett.

856
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:03,039
When was the last confirmed
contact with Corbett?

857
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,399
Well, I'm sorry,
ma'am, I'd have to check.

858
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,919
We've checked.

859
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,839
It was the 12th of March,

860
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:14,300
a few hours before you visited
Lee Banks in Blackthorn Prison.

861
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,079
Now, turning to Lisa McQueen.

862
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,319
She was interviewed by your leading
investigators

863
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,519
into Operation Pear Tree,
DI Fleming and DS Arnott.

864
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,159
We've been able to listen to the
DIR of that interview.

865
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,479
Reading from the transcript, McQueen,

866
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,959
"We got a tip off there was
a rat in the unit.

867
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,559
"He must have lost his bottle."

868
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,719
"He" being Corbett.

869
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,679
DI Fleming,
"Where did the tip-off come from?"

870
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:41,159
McQueen, "It came from out
of Blackthorn."

871
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,237
Superintendent Hastings, did you
reveal sensitive information

872
00:53:44,238 --> 00:53:47,839
to Lee Banks regarding DS John
Corbett's undercover operation

873
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,319
with the OCG?

874
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,879
No, I did not.

875
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,959
What would have been
the consequences, if you had?

876
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:57,799
Well, I think Corbett would have
considered his position

877
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:01,599
and sought refuge in the nearest
police station.

878
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,720
Unless the OCG got to him first.

879
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,239
For the DIR,
the interviewee is not responding.

880
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,409
I'd now like to present evidence
from a forensic recovery

881
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:17,060
at... McDade & Company breakers yard.

882
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,079
Images 67 to 72 show us
a body bag being forensically

883
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:25,359
recovered from McDade & Company
breakers yard.

884
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:29,519
The body bag contains body parts
relating to a property developer

885
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,040
who's been a missing person since 2012.

886
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,980
Miss Jacqueline Laverty.

887
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,020
Do you recognise Miss Laverty?

888
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,239
Hmm, yes, I do.

889
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:49,159
She was the mistress of a police officer

890
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,439
who was under investigation,
DCI Tony Gates.

891
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:56,119
Mm. Gates stated that he was present
when Miss Laverty was murdered

892
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,593
by members of the OCG,

893
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:59,685
so it's highly likely,
wouldn't you agree,

894
00:54:59,686 --> 00:55:02,920
that this body bag was dumped by the OCG?

895
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,679
Yeah. Yes.

896
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,759
Also present in the body bag

897
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:14,799
were the remains relating to an IC1
male aged approximately 40 years.

898
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,959
A postmortem has revealed that the victim

899
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:20,719
died of exsanguination
following a knife wound to the neck.

900
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,639
Fingerprints and DNA

901
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:27,920
match IDENT1 elimination samples
of a serving police officer.

902
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,980
Detective Sergeant John Corbett.

903
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,921
Superintendent Edward Hastings,

904
00:55:36,922 --> 00:55:39,359
I believe we have demonstrated you
had motive

905
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,959
to want Corbett dead...

906
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,453
- No...
- ..and the opportunity and means

907
00:55:43,454 --> 00:55:45,919
to disclose to Lee Banks that he
was an undercover police officer.

908
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,199
No. Never!

909
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,389
It is clear to me that the
threshold test has been passed

910
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:51,919
and therefore it is my lawful
right to arrest you

911
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,039
on suspicion of conspiracy
to murder John Corbett.

912
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,239
No, no, no!

913
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:58,199
You will be held in custody while we
gather further evidence against you.

914
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,119
No! What is happening here?
I am being framed!

915
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,559
Interview terminated.

916
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,480
Look, I am not bent!

917
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,879
- Thank you, Tina.
- Ma'am.

918
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,359
- I assume you've been informed.
- Yes, ma'am.

919
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,959
You did the right thing, pointing
the finger at your own Gaffer.

920
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,319
It takes guts, integrity.

921
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,999
It tells me that I can
count on the two of you.

922
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,919
Count on us for what, ma'am?

923
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,759
Today was just for starters.

924
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,440
I'm going to prove that Hastings is "H".

925
00:56:54,305 --> 00:57:54,638

1
00:00:05,223 --> 00:00:06,515
My baby!

2
00:00:06,516 --> 00:00:08,103
Back up, back up!

3
00:00:14,996 --> 00:00:16,956
If she's alive, finish her!

4
00:00:18,636 --> 00:00:19,914
She's a goner!

5
00:00:22,463 --> 00:00:25,170
The transport contained heroin with
a street value of ten million.

6
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:27,850
ED905's back in the hands
of Organised Crime.

7
00:00:27,851 --> 00:00:28,970
Nice work, lads.

8
00:00:28,971 --> 00:00:31,263
The hijack required inside information.

9
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:36,050
Vihaan Malhotra, Civilian Administrator.

10
00:00:36,051 --> 00:00:37,530
Down! Stay down!

11
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:39,410
I know what you're up to.

12
00:00:39,411 --> 00:00:40,850
What are we up to, Vihaan?

13
00:00:40,851 --> 00:00:42,743
Protecting one of your own.

14
00:00:45,251 --> 00:00:48,023
What is your relationship
with Vihaan Malhotra?

15
00:00:48,371 --> 00:00:49,970
He's my cousin, Ma'am.

16
00:00:49,971 --> 00:00:52,610
I never knew it was so bad,
what Vihaan was doing,

17
00:00:52,611 --> 00:00:54,983
otherwise I'd never have
gone along with it.

18
00:00:57,051 --> 00:01:00,010
You are finished with the Force,
and that's only the start of it.

19
00:01:00,011 --> 00:01:04,023
Christ knows what criminal charges
you're going to end up facing.

20
00:01:08,891 --> 00:01:12,210
I passed information to ACC Hilton.

21
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:15,810
He was the senior police officer
who was running the show

22
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:17,530
for Organised Crime.

23
00:01:17,531 --> 00:01:20,891
Killing himself was the only
decent thing that man ever did.

24
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:29,210
I am deeply sorry for having not
consulted you about the finances.

25
00:01:29,211 --> 00:01:31,210
I'm a married man.

26
00:01:31,211 --> 00:01:32,743
Separated.

27

28
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:44,290
It's called Operation Pear Tree.

29
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,730
Our brief was to embed
an undercover officer

30
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,650
within an organised crime group.

31
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:51,091
Detective Sergeant John Corbett.

32
00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:56,170
I'm in a rush.
Let's just swap insurance...

33
00:02:01,451 --> 00:02:04,330
There's only one thing worse
than a bent copper,

34
00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:07,450
that's a bent copper who pretends
she isn't.

35
00:02:07,451 --> 00:02:09,491
Shut up, this ain't helping!

36
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:48,171
That's her.

37
00:02:50,524 --> 00:02:51,764
Yeah.

38
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:55,051
Sorry. It can't have been easy.

39
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:01,810
I'll stick around for
forensic examination

40
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:03,451
- and report back to the boss.
- OK.

41
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,650
You recognise this place, yeah?

42
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:14,151
Yeah.

43
00:03:19,903 --> 00:03:24,183
Assistant Chief Constable Hilton's
body, as found in 2017.

44
00:03:25,011 --> 00:03:26,583
Assumed to be suicide.

45
00:03:27,451 --> 00:03:29,531
Now looking more possible he was killed.

46
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,850
Maneet was complicit
in Hilton's corruption,

47
00:03:32,851 --> 00:03:34,463
killed in the same location.

48
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:38,623
Maybe she knew something
and had to be silenced.

49
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:42,090
I really wanted to give her
the benefit of the doubt.

50
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:44,983
I hate to say it, I think she was
more involved than we thought.

51
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:47,970
I mean, you work right beside someone...

52
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:51,354
- Sir.
- Sir.

53
00:03:51,943 --> 00:03:53,290
It's an awful business.

54
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,863
Awful business.

55
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,730
Does the family know yet?

56
00:03:56,731 --> 00:03:58,583
Yes, sir. They're rallying round.

57
00:03:59,423 --> 00:04:01,651
What's going to happen
to those poor wee children?

58
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:06,491
Do we know anything of Maneet's
movements prior to this?

59
00:04:08,611 --> 00:04:11,211
Shot by a bystander on his smartphone.

60
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:18,810
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, God.

61
00:04:18,811 --> 00:04:20,770
- What's going on?
- What are they doing to her?

62
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:22,186
- Are you getting this?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

63
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:24,411
Keep filming. Keep filming!

64
00:04:27,091 --> 00:04:29,490
Serious Crime are running
ID on the suspects.

65
00:04:29,491 --> 00:04:32,210
They're running ANPR on the vehicle
to try and track its movements.

66
00:04:32,211 --> 00:04:33,970
And, what,
we're going to sit on our hands

67
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:36,170
while Serious Crime run
the whole shooting match?

68
00:04:36,171 --> 00:04:37,503
I don't think so.

69
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:45,531
Sir.

70
00:04:56,331 --> 00:04:57,783
Ma'am?

71
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,170
PCC's asked to be in on this meeting.

72
00:05:00,171 --> 00:05:02,290
We've not met, have we,
Superintendent Hastings?

73
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,170
Rohan Sindwhani.

74
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,890
I know who you are, Mr Sindwhani.

75
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:09,010
Then you'll know
I was elected to shake things up.

76
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:12,290
Deputy Chief Constable Wise
knows my feelings on this subject.

77
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:15,450
For too long, the extent of police
corruption has been covered up

78
00:05:15,451 --> 00:05:18,710
- for fear of losing public trust.
- Absolutely, absolutely.

79
00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:21,170
And that is why in my department,
AC-12, we're determined to get

80
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:23,290
to the bottom of it, we're the
best in the business.

81
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:29,610
My senior legal counsel, Gill Biggeloe.

82
00:05:29,611 --> 00:05:31,571
You don't mind if she sits in?

83
00:05:32,691 --> 00:05:33,983
No.

84
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:37,330
You were intending to brief me
on your inquiry's findings

85
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:39,290
regarding the hijack?

86
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,490
Yes, Ma'am, that's correct.

87
00:05:40,491 --> 00:05:46,130
But it's even more complex,
and more troubling,

88
00:05:46,131 --> 00:05:47,290
than we first thought.

89
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:51,170
The OCG, that's the Organised Crime
Group, may be implicated

90
00:05:51,171 --> 00:05:55,450
in the death of a former AC-12
officer, PC Maneet Bindra.

91
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:58,930
And we're also investigating
an undercover operation,

92
00:05:58,931 --> 00:06:00,691
Operation Pear Tree.

93
00:06:01,811 --> 00:06:03,490
- Pear Tree?
- Yes.

94
00:06:03,491 --> 00:06:07,450
We require access to all the files
pertaining to Operation Pear Tree

95
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:09,722
in order to investigate the possibility

96
00:06:09,723 --> 00:06:13,010
that a serving undercover officer
may be participating

97
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:14,863
in criminal activities.

98
00:06:16,698 --> 00:06:17,891
My God!

99
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:22,370
I'm also here to ask the DCC
for access to Serious Crime's

100
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:25,170
investigation of the
suspicious death of PC Bindra.

101
00:06:25,171 --> 00:06:27,792
There's a point of principle
with respect to a police unit

102
00:06:27,793 --> 00:06:31,090
investigating an offence in which
one of your former officers

103
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:32,903
is the victim.

104
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:37,250
Granted, Ma'am, granted,
but unless my officers have access

105
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:41,023
to all the lines of inquiry,
we simply cannot do our job.

106
00:06:47,971 --> 00:06:52,543
Andrea, I'd be grateful
if you'd take the pragmatic view.

107
00:06:56,651 --> 00:07:00,090
AC-12 will have access
to Operation Pear Tree

108
00:07:00,091 --> 00:07:02,490
and to Serious Crime's investigation.

109
00:07:02,491 --> 00:07:05,091
Thank you, Ma'am. You won't regret it.

110
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:14,330
That's the problem
with corruption inquiries.

111
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:16,571
There's always the danger
you'll find some.

112
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:21,050
DI Fleming, AC-12.

113
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:24,059
We have the lawful authority to
investigate Operation Pear Tree.

114
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,610
All officers to your desks.

115
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,610
You'll each be questioned
by an AC-12 caseworker.

116
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:31,210
You'll each be obliged to surrender
all materials relating to

117
00:07:31,211 --> 00:07:34,010
Operation Pear Tree to said case worker.

118
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:37,250
Failure to comply will be a breach
of your Duties and Responsibilities

119
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:38,970
under Police Conduct Regulations

120
00:07:38,971 --> 00:07:42,850
and may lead to a misconduct charge
under said regulations.

121
00:07:42,851 --> 00:07:46,210
What the hell's going on?
Our work here is confidential.

122
00:07:46,211 --> 00:07:48,130
DC Eldwick. Is this your desk?

123
00:07:48,131 --> 00:07:50,650
No files will be surrendered
without my say so.

124
00:07:50,651 --> 00:07:53,610
Ma'am, you're obstructing police
officers in their lawful duty which,

125
00:07:53,611 --> 00:07:56,771
as you know, is a criminal offence,
rendering you subject to arrest.

126
00:07:59,144 --> 00:08:00,344
Phillip.

127
00:08:02,251 --> 00:08:04,650
PC Yacoob. Take me to your desk, please.

128
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,291
Box 23219.

129
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,850
These are the most significant items

130
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:22,890
that have been shared from Serious
Crime's search of Maneet's address.

131
00:08:22,891 --> 00:08:25,103
Audio files on a home computer.

132
00:08:27,878 --> 00:08:29,838
I think you need to hear this one first.

133
00:08:32,651 --> 00:08:37,890
I'm making this audio file
via a miniature recording device.

134
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:42,663
My plan is to carry out undercover
surveillance on the OCG.

135
00:08:43,411 --> 00:08:49,170
I let AC-12 down. I betrayed
Superintendent Hastings' trust.

136
00:08:49,171 --> 00:08:51,291
This is how I'm going to make up for it.

137
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:56,863
End of recording.

138
00:08:59,771 --> 00:09:00,811
My God.

139
00:09:03,131 --> 00:09:04,810
I feel awful now.

140
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:05,983
Me too.

141
00:09:09,251 --> 00:09:11,303
OK. So what else have we got?

142
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,451
Then there was this.

143
00:09:15,531 --> 00:09:17,463
You checked her over?

144
00:09:18,171 --> 00:09:21,290
No weapons, no recording devices.

145
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,410
She's clean.

146
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:24,131
So what's all this about?

147
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:30,583
No other female voices on the
recordings, only Maneet's and hers.

148
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,890
So where's DS John Corbett in all this?

149
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:36,343
Nowhere.

150
00:09:36,731 --> 00:09:38,211
He's still a mystery.

151
00:09:51,863 --> 00:09:54,170
Was it really necessary to leave
her body down at the harbour?

152
00:09:54,171 --> 00:09:55,930
Could have just dumped it
in the landfill.

153
00:09:55,931 --> 00:09:57,690
The police would have been
none the wiser.

154
00:09:57,691 --> 00:09:59,210
Now here's what I don't understand.

155
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:01,610
We've netted gear worth ten million quid,

156
00:10:01,611 --> 00:10:03,370
we've put a rival unit out of business

157
00:10:03,371 --> 00:10:06,210
and no bastard's even
picked up the phone.

158
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:08,703
Oi, you! No good.

159
00:10:10,691 --> 00:10:13,650
Now, we've got a good thing
going on here with this unit, Lise.

160
00:10:13,651 --> 00:10:17,103
With a bit more support from above,
we could do some serious business.

161
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:21,423
The boys have fallen for all this
cos you've got brains.

162
00:10:21,771 --> 00:10:25,063
But you're what? Less than a year in.

163
00:10:26,171 --> 00:10:28,130
I've earned my place.

164
00:10:28,131 --> 00:10:30,663
I follow orders.
That's the way you do business.

165
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:34,530
In case you haven't noticed, Lise,
we don't do a nine to five,

166
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:36,610
and we don't work
in some shitty little office

167
00:10:36,611 --> 00:10:38,930
waiting for some idiot boss
to tell you what to do,

168
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:41,223
hoping you get thrown a crumb
every now and again.

169
00:10:42,011 --> 00:10:43,810
I've had my fill of that.

170
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:46,090
Money, power, respect,

171
00:10:46,091 --> 00:10:48,011
that's what I'm in this for.

172
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:51,771
And I reckon you are, too.

173
00:10:52,811 --> 00:10:54,943
You, very good.

174
00:10:55,251 --> 00:10:57,650
But quicker. Faster.

175
00:10:57,651 --> 00:11:00,010
Money! Money, money, money!

176
00:11:00,011 --> 00:11:04,331
My plan is to carry out
undercover surveillance on the OCG.

177
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:10,371
I let AC-12 down. I betrayed
Superintendent Hastings' trust.

178
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,891
This is how I'm going to make up for it.

179
00:11:16,531 --> 00:11:18,171
End of recording.

180
00:11:20,811 --> 00:11:22,211
Thank you. Thank you.

181
00:11:33,131 --> 00:11:35,303
Can I have your attention, please?

182
00:11:36,811 --> 00:11:38,743
We've lost one of our own.

183
00:11:40,251 --> 00:11:41,983
PC Maneet Bindra.

184
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:47,303
Young officer,
mother with two young children.

185
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:52,891
If you've ever asked yourself
the reason why we do this job...

186
00:11:56,237 --> 00:11:57,277
...this is it.

187
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,491
Carry on.

188
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:01,811
- Sir.
- Sir.

189
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:06,983
Tatleen, the, er...

190
00:12:07,491 --> 00:12:09,610
...the Red Notice that we
served on Maneet Bindra,

191
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:11,130
has it been actioned yet?

192
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:13,891
No, sir. Her Fed Rep launched
an appeal and we were just...

193
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:14,811
Yes.

194
00:12:14,812 --> 00:12:16,331
Yes. Rescind it.

195
00:12:17,491 --> 00:12:20,890
I shall talk to DCC Wise
and remind her that

196
00:12:20,891 --> 00:12:23,250
Maneet Bindra was still
a serving AC-12 officer

197
00:12:23,251 --> 00:12:25,171
at the time of her murder.

198
00:12:26,624 --> 00:12:28,704
She died in the line of duty.

199
00:12:44,651 --> 00:12:46,091
Superintendent Hastings?

200
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:49,010
DCI Mark Moffatt.

201
00:12:49,011 --> 00:12:50,250
Well, retired DCI.

202
00:12:50,251 --> 00:12:53,290
Sorry to ambush you like this.
You're not an easy man to find.

203
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,770
Oh, yeah, Roz Huntley's Fed Rep.

204
00:12:55,771 --> 00:12:58,010
- Listen, mate, it's been a long day...
- Yeah.

205
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:01,810
Let me just spit it out and then
you can tell me to sling my hook.

206
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:04,690
Since retiring, I've joined a mate's
property development business,

207
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:07,330
and one of our new projects
is in the Republic of Ireland,

208
00:13:07,331 --> 00:13:09,051
the Kettle Bell Complex.

209
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:12,770
- I'd rather not discuss that...
- We've taken over redevelopment,

210
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:16,783
and our terms of business include
compensating the original investors.

211
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:22,090
I've got the right man?
You were one of the unlucky ones?

212
00:13:22,091 --> 00:13:23,211
Yeah.

213
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,531
Maybe I can take you for a drink?

214
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:31,090
Yeah, wait there. I'll be right back.

215
00:13:31,091 --> 00:13:32,131
Sure.

216
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:53,810
Thank you, Steve.

217
00:13:53,811 --> 00:13:54,891
Thank you, sir.

218
00:13:56,371 --> 00:14:00,730
Operation Pear Tree commenced
on 22nd January 2018

219
00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:04,610
under the command of Detective
Superintendent Alison Powell,

220
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:07,290
with authority to embed
an undercover officer

221
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,183
in an organised crime group.

222
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:11,210
What we've now learned

223
00:14:11,211 --> 00:14:14,450
is the objective of Operation
Pear Tree was to investigate

224
00:14:14,451 --> 00:14:17,530
institutionalised links between
corrupt police officers

225
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:18,730
and organised crime.

226
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:23,090
An operation on our patch
and no-one told us a dickybird, eh?

227
00:14:23,091 --> 00:14:25,450
DS John Corbett.

228
00:14:25,451 --> 00:14:29,530
One year ago, John Corbett
left his desk and never went back.

229
00:14:29,531 --> 00:14:31,570
His colleagues were never
told where he went,

230
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:33,930
and ordered never to disclose
he'd worked with them.

231
00:14:33,931 --> 00:14:36,210
His files were erased from
the police database,

232
00:14:36,211 --> 00:14:39,970
his phone number and e-mail deleted,
his name removed from the payroll.

233
00:14:39,971 --> 00:14:41,930
What we now know from these files

234
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:44,851
is that Corbett was given
a new identity...

235
00:14:46,171 --> 00:14:50,983
...John Clayton,
a forger with multiple convictions.

236
00:14:51,811 --> 00:14:55,290
DS Corbett had been a printer
before he joined the Force.

237
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:58,410
As Clayton, he offered his services
to the highest bidder.

238
00:14:58,411 --> 00:15:01,250
Files seized yesterday
reveal Clayton succeeded

239
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:03,690
in convincing an OCG to recruit him,

240
00:15:03,691 --> 00:15:06,570
and he soon became a trusted member
of the OCG,

241
00:15:06,571 --> 00:15:08,530
responsible for overseeing the production

242
00:15:08,531 --> 00:15:10,930
of lucrative forgeries
of identity documents,

243
00:15:10,931 --> 00:15:15,690
legal documents, invoices, receipts,
certificates, you name it.

244
00:15:15,691 --> 00:15:16,983
Ma'am.

245
00:15:17,411 --> 00:15:20,770
Operation Pear Tree files show that
DS Corbett has been out of contact

246
00:15:20,771 --> 00:15:23,690
with his COM and Cover Officer
for nearly three months.

247
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:26,090
In that time, he's believed to have
actively participated

248
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,730
in criminal offences,

249
00:15:27,731 --> 00:15:31,370
namely the hijack of Seized Goods
Transport ED905,

250
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:33,170
the murder of three AFOs,

251
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:34,970
the attempted murder of a fourth

252
00:15:34,971 --> 00:15:37,703
and possibly even the death
of Maneet Bindra.

253
00:15:41,131 --> 00:15:43,290
This is an image of the vehicle
used to abduct Maneet,

254
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,890
captured by a member of the public
who witnessed the incident.

255
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:47,250
Now, using ANPR,

256
00:15:47,251 --> 00:15:50,210
we've been able to track the vehicle
heading towards Edge Park,

257
00:15:50,211 --> 00:15:51,410
but the trail ran out,

258
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:54,583
leaving us unable to determine
the vehicle's destination.

259
00:15:55,091 --> 00:15:57,450
But from the same set of images,

260
00:15:57,451 --> 00:16:00,811
we were able to capture a clear
image of one of Maneet's abductors.

261
00:16:02,411 --> 00:16:05,610
Recognition software gives
a 90% likelihood the subject

262
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:11,063
is Lee Banks, a career criminal with
numerous convictions for violence.

263
00:16:11,531 --> 00:16:15,011
One of Banks's known associates
is Robert Denmoor.

264
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:18,970
Forensic evidence linked Denmoor
to OCG interference

265
00:16:18,971 --> 00:16:23,771
into Operation Trapdoor,
led by DCI Roz Huntley in 2017.

266
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,849
You'll all recall that Denmoor
was shot dead in this building

267
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,403
by the gaffer.

268
00:16:29,428 --> 00:16:31,930
What all this means is
there's a proven association

269
00:16:31,931 --> 00:16:34,730
between Corbett's OCG
and the network of corrupt officers

270
00:16:34,731 --> 00:16:36,610
we've been investigating all these years.

271
00:16:36,611 --> 00:16:38,810
And is there anything in the files
that might suggest

272
00:16:38,811 --> 00:16:40,250
why Corbett's gone rogue?

273
00:16:40,863 --> 00:16:43,450
We've been looking specifically
at the time leading up to the point

274
00:16:43,451 --> 00:16:46,170
where Corbett ceased contact
with his COM.

275
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,623
The entries have been
redacted from the files.

276
00:16:49,731 --> 00:16:51,743
Thank you, Steve. Kate.

277
00:16:52,651 --> 00:16:57,570
So your orders are to establish
the whereabouts of John Corbett

278
00:16:57,571 --> 00:17:00,130
and to apprehend him without delay.

279
00:17:00,131 --> 00:17:01,263
Sir.

280
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:11,530
Ma'am, about those redacted entries,

281
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,770
the current COM on Operation
Pear Tree was appointed

282
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:15,410
after Corbett stopped responding.

283
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:17,090
I've got a name for the original COM,

284
00:17:17,091 --> 00:17:19,671
- and Tatleen's trying to track her down.
- Good.

285
00:17:20,611 --> 00:17:22,063
Look, Kate...

286
00:17:23,131 --> 00:17:25,570
...Corbett's embedded in a group
of hardened criminals

287
00:17:25,571 --> 00:17:28,330
who'd execute him if they
discover his true identity.

288
00:17:28,331 --> 00:17:30,530
I've been there. It's not nice.

289
00:17:30,531 --> 00:17:34,210
All I'm saying is he's
anti-corruption, same as us.

290
00:17:34,211 --> 00:17:36,410
Should we consider the lengths
he might be forced to

291
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:38,410
- to maintain his cover?
- Sure.

292
00:17:38,411 --> 00:17:39,931
For about two seconds.

293
00:17:52,451 --> 00:17:55,611
Long way north. I'm surprised
it hasn't given you a nosebleed.

294
00:17:59,531 --> 00:18:02,050
- I didn't get no biscuits in.
- We're fine, thanks.

295
00:18:02,051 --> 00:18:04,690
As I explained over the phone,
Mrs Corbett, we're a specialist

296
00:18:04,691 --> 00:18:06,570
anti-corruption unit making inquiries

297
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:08,410
into serious criminal offences.

298
00:18:08,411 --> 00:18:10,330
I've been a copper's wife long enough

299
00:18:10,331 --> 00:18:11,623
to know what anti-corruption means.

300
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,610
You reckon John's involved.

301
00:18:14,611 --> 00:18:16,610
We're keeping an open mind.

302
00:18:16,611 --> 00:18:19,371
Steph... Is it OK if I call you Steph?

303
00:18:20,771 --> 00:18:22,610
I've been an undercover officer myself,

304
00:18:22,611 --> 00:18:25,610
so I do understand the stresses
your husband's under.

305
00:18:25,611 --> 00:18:28,303
We need to form a picture
of his current state of mind.

306
00:18:28,851 --> 00:18:30,490
I can't help you.

307
00:18:30,491 --> 00:18:32,330
I haven't heard from him.

308
00:18:32,331 --> 00:18:34,250
Don't expect to neither.

309
00:18:34,251 --> 00:18:35,903
Why do you say that?

310
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:37,770
Ask her.

311
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:39,650
She was undercover.

312
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,010
Perfect job for a selfish arsehole
that don't give a toss

313
00:18:42,011 --> 00:18:43,583
about his own family.

314
00:18:45,731 --> 00:18:47,650
John's done undercover operations before.

315
00:18:47,651 --> 00:18:49,730
What's different about this one,
do you think?

316
00:18:49,731 --> 00:18:51,650
I'll tell you what's different.

317
00:18:51,651 --> 00:18:53,170
Nothing.

318
00:18:53,171 --> 00:18:55,290
He gets to run around
like he's single again,

319
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:58,490
and I'm left with a house to run
and two kids to bring up.

320
00:18:58,491 --> 00:19:00,731
You've come hoping
I can help you find him?

321
00:19:03,197 --> 00:19:04,663
I don't want to find him.

322
00:19:15,891 --> 00:19:18,423
- Not too late?
- No. Just right, ta.

323
00:19:19,571 --> 00:19:23,290
Look, what Corbett's missus
said about undercover work,

324
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,010
that was never you?

325
00:19:25,011 --> 00:19:27,783
Thanks, Steve, but she was right.

326
00:19:28,091 --> 00:19:31,783
I mean, getting promoted
and working new hours,

327
00:19:32,211 --> 00:19:34,090
it's given me a chance to make up
for all that.

328
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:36,970
I'm just glad me and Mark are
making a go of things again

329
00:19:36,971 --> 00:19:38,903
and I can be a proper mum.

330
00:19:39,851 --> 00:19:41,811
- I'm glad for you, mate.
- Thanks.

331
00:19:43,211 --> 00:19:46,010
Your turn next... to settle down!

332
00:19:46,011 --> 00:19:47,930
Yeah, right.

333
00:19:47,931 --> 00:19:49,251
- Night, mate.
- Night.

334
00:20:00,651 --> 00:20:02,170
Hey.

335
00:20:02,171 --> 00:20:04,063
- Perfect timing.
- Oh, great.

336
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:06,891
Hey, you all right?

337
00:20:08,131 --> 00:20:09,941
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

338
00:20:09,966 --> 00:20:11,143
Love you.

339
00:20:11,531 --> 00:20:13,463
I'll see you in the morning.

340
00:20:13,931 --> 00:20:15,611
- Night.
- Night-night.

341
00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:26,290
Vihaan explained to me
how he made contact with the OCG.

342
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:30,130
There's a phone box in Moss Heath,
on the corner of Tates Avenue.

343
00:20:30,131 --> 00:20:32,170
They put a business card
in there that looks like

344
00:20:32,171 --> 00:20:33,970
it's for sexual services.

345
00:20:33,971 --> 00:20:36,850
The number keeps changing,
but the name's always the same,

346
00:20:36,851 --> 00:20:38,650
Nikki 9.

347
00:20:38,651 --> 00:20:41,170
You go through a series of set phrases.

348
00:20:41,171 --> 00:20:44,890
You start with, "Got a tip for you,"
like you're talking to a gambler.

349
00:20:44,891 --> 00:20:47,810
Then you quote the odds as "100 to 300".

350
00:20:47,811 --> 00:20:51,570
No matter what they say back,
you stick with those odds.

351
00:20:51,571 --> 00:20:53,810
Then either they give you
instructions for a meeting

352
00:20:53,811 --> 00:20:56,051
or drop off a burner phone.

353
00:20:58,171 --> 00:20:59,610
Hello?

354
00:20:59,611 --> 00:21:01,250
What do you want?

355
00:21:01,251 --> 00:21:02,890
Got a tip for you.

356
00:21:02,891 --> 00:21:04,490
Not interested.

357
00:21:04,491 --> 00:21:05,770
Decent odds.

358
00:21:05,771 --> 00:21:06,970
100-30.

359
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:08,743
You taking the piss or what?

360
00:21:09,331 --> 00:21:10,823
100-30.

361
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:14,743
Wait there.

362
00:21:59,331 --> 00:22:00,371
Yes!

363
00:22:14,451 --> 00:22:17,211
Hey, guys. Come and have a look at this.

364
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:29,050
You know him?

365
00:22:29,051 --> 00:22:31,690
Copper. Steve something.

366
00:22:31,691 --> 00:22:34,383
Arnold. Dunno.

367
00:22:35,411 --> 00:22:36,418
Is he bent?

368
00:22:36,443 --> 00:22:38,543
Far as I can remember,
couldn't be straighter.

369
00:22:41,503 --> 00:22:43,503
You did the right thing, lads.

370
00:22:43,851 --> 00:22:46,183
We already fell for it once with Maneet.

371
00:22:46,904 --> 00:22:48,744
We're not the mugs they think we are.

372
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,187
Nice one.

373
00:22:50,212 --> 00:22:51,475
- Cheers, John.
- No worries.

374
00:22:54,491 --> 00:22:57,770
For Christ's sake, John.
He's investigating Maneet's murder.

375
00:22:57,771 --> 00:22:59,130
Let's get a move on, then.

376
00:22:59,131 --> 00:23:01,490
- What do you mean?
- I've got a plan.

377
00:23:01,491 --> 00:23:02,983
Something big.

378
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:06,411
Let's make use of our assets
before this muppet gets to them.

379
00:23:23,411 --> 00:23:24,730
Hi.

380
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:28,343
District Nurse here to see Jane Cafferty.

381
00:23:29,051 --> 00:23:30,690
Oh, er...

382
00:23:30,691 --> 00:23:33,690
Sorry, the hospital's rubbish
at notifying people.

383
00:23:33,691 --> 00:23:36,210
He's checking. I just need
to carry out an assessment

384
00:23:36,211 --> 00:23:38,552
to make sure everything's
in place with her mobility,

385
00:23:38,553 --> 00:23:41,130
dressings, medication, etc.

386
00:23:41,131 --> 00:23:42,210
That's fine.

387
00:23:42,211 --> 00:23:45,930
Jane's still in a bit of pain.
It'd be good if you could see her.

388
00:23:45,931 --> 00:23:46,971
Standing by.

389
00:23:49,171 --> 00:23:51,370
Maybe I should try again tomorrow.

390
00:23:51,371 --> 00:23:52,863
It's all good. Go in.

391
00:24:01,844 --> 00:24:02,884
This way.

392
00:24:08,131 --> 00:24:10,810
Sorry, are you all right
to give us bit of...

393
00:24:10,811 --> 00:24:13,290
Yes, of course, some privacy.

394
00:24:13,543 --> 00:24:14,583
Thanks.

395
00:24:22,091 --> 00:24:25,223
Hello, Jane. I'm Alice.

396
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:28,810
I need to start by asking you a few
questions, if that's all right.

397
00:24:28,811 --> 00:24:30,743
Am I OK to call you Jane?

398
00:24:34,571 --> 00:24:38,250
You shot me. You killed my team.

399
00:24:38,251 --> 00:24:40,371
I swear to God if I wasn't
in this bed, I'd...

400
00:24:41,531 --> 00:24:44,530
We crossed you, Jane,
but it weren't my idea.

401
00:24:44,531 --> 00:24:46,183
My family.

402
00:24:46,571 --> 00:24:48,051
They're safe.

403
00:24:50,611 --> 00:24:53,343
No-one's planning to finish
the job on you.

404
00:24:53,851 --> 00:24:55,543
I'm here to talk business.

405
00:24:56,451 --> 00:24:58,623
No. No. I've done my bit.

406
00:24:59,691 --> 00:25:00,731
Lovely husband.

407
00:25:02,171 --> 00:25:03,463
Lovely kids.

408
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:07,970
Their safety was your first thought,

409
00:25:07,971 --> 00:25:11,303
but there's other ways that
you could lose them, Jane...

410
00:25:13,331 --> 00:25:14,651
...as we both know.

411
00:25:25,011 --> 00:25:26,850
Did you get what we need?

412
00:25:26,851 --> 00:25:29,330
- Yeah.
- Good girl.

413
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:31,290
This is good.

414
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:32,663
Maybe.

415
00:25:55,131 --> 00:25:58,503
They're on the move, John,
but they've upped security.

416
00:26:00,411 --> 00:26:01,730
How much?

417
00:26:01,731 --> 00:26:04,530
Four escort vehicles, 12 AFOs.

418
00:26:04,531 --> 00:26:07,463
We're outnumbered.
Maybe we should call it off.

419
00:26:08,371 --> 00:26:09,823
No. We'll just have to cope.

420
00:26:14,811 --> 00:26:17,090
Right, lads. They're on their way.

421
00:26:17,091 --> 00:26:19,810
So remember, do exactly as I told you.

422
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,078
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

423
00:26:21,103 --> 00:26:23,971
All right. Let's go, let's go! Come
on, let's go! Let's move. Let's go!

424
00:26:41,331 --> 00:26:42,850
Go, go, go, go, go!

425
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:43,891
Come on!

426
00:27:07,011 --> 00:27:09,410
Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

427
00:27:16,971 --> 00:27:18,251
Stay down. Get down.

428
00:27:21,811 --> 00:27:23,611
Multiple gunmen firing on us.

429
00:27:34,491 --> 00:27:36,931
Get out! Get out now!

430
00:27:40,971 --> 00:27:44,343
We have ARVs en route.
They'll be with you soon.

431
00:27:48,491 --> 00:27:49,863
What the hell are you doing?

432
00:27:51,731 --> 00:27:53,570
He was going to shoot you!

433
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:55,783
Come on, Lee, let's go!

434
00:27:57,731 --> 00:28:00,210
Go! Move! Move!

435
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:01,571
Go, go, go!

436
00:28:11,811 --> 00:28:13,051
Go, go, go!

437
00:28:38,131 --> 00:28:40,651
Very nice.

438
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:49,131
Drinks are on me, lads.

439
00:29:06,731 --> 00:29:09,250
Keep me updated on traffic reports
and Air Ops.

440
00:29:09,251 --> 00:29:11,931
A convoy of vehicles can't
just vanish into thin air.

441
00:29:14,411 --> 00:29:15,707
Thanks for the call.

442
00:29:16,303 --> 00:29:18,433
I thought you lot were meant to be
leading this inquiry.

443
00:29:18,434 --> 00:29:20,330
Yeah, well, we won't know for sure
it's them

444
00:29:20,331 --> 00:29:22,290
unless the ballistics
match the heroin hijack.

445
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:24,851
Oh, yeah? Want to bet against it?

446
00:29:27,091 --> 00:29:29,090
What they get this time?

447
00:29:29,091 --> 00:29:31,851
Central Ballistic Lab's
five minutes down the road...

448
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:36,091
...a cache of automatic rifles
en route to be destroyed.

449
00:29:40,171 --> 00:29:42,250
How many casualties?

450
00:29:42,251 --> 00:29:43,291
None.

451
00:29:45,464 --> 00:29:46,504
None?

452
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:02,903
Look. I, erm...

453
00:30:05,944 --> 00:30:07,263
...I screwed up.

454
00:30:08,531 --> 00:30:10,163
I got it wrong and you were right

455
00:30:10,188 --> 00:30:11,490
- to react the way you did.
- Sam...

456
00:30:11,491 --> 00:30:12,601
...it's fine.

457
00:30:13,517 --> 00:30:14,637
Water under the bridge.

458
00:30:15,803 --> 00:30:16,843
I know, I just...

459
00:30:18,531 --> 00:30:20,703
...I wanted to say it, you know.

460
00:30:22,371 --> 00:30:23,691
Sorry.

461
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:30,978
Anyway...

462
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:33,770
...be nice to catch up.

463
00:30:33,771 --> 00:30:35,011
It's been too long.

464
00:30:36,171 --> 00:30:38,063
Yeah. Sure.

465
00:30:41,611 --> 00:30:43,371
Do you want to come up?

466
00:30:44,771 --> 00:30:48,143
I need to get everything together
for the gaffer and Kate first thing.

467
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:50,371
I'll call you.

468
00:30:52,211 --> 00:30:54,463
By the hairs on your chinny-chin-chin.

469
00:31:55,851 --> 00:31:57,605
- John?
- Steph, Steph,

470
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,115
it's me, love. I'm OK, I'm safe.

471
00:32:00,091 --> 00:32:02,530
I worry when I don't hear from you.

472
00:32:02,531 --> 00:32:04,130
I'm sorry I can't call more.

473
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:06,623
John, there were coppers here
asking about you.

474
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:08,370
I got their names.

475
00:32:08,371 --> 00:32:11,810
DI Kate Fleming and DS Steve Arnott.

476
00:32:11,811 --> 00:32:13,083
Arnott.

477
00:32:13,108 --> 00:32:15,370
I just said exactly what
you told me to say.

478
00:32:15,371 --> 00:32:17,851
No. I know you would.
Hey, you did the right thing.

479
00:32:20,451 --> 00:32:22,691
It's good to hear your voice.

480
00:32:24,564 --> 00:32:25,903
I love you.

481
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:28,311
I miss you so much.

482
00:32:30,171 --> 00:32:31,890
Are the girls all right?

483
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,150
They're sleeping.

484
00:32:35,383 --> 00:32:37,530
Can I listen?

485
00:32:37,937 --> 00:32:40,017
I'll put the phone next to Gemma.

486
00:33:03,131 --> 00:33:05,450
The chief constable has assured me

487
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:08,090
that all necessary security was in place.

488
00:33:08,091 --> 00:33:10,770
This force is committed to bringing
these criminals...

489
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:14,770
Sarge? I've located Corbett's
former covert-ops manager.

490
00:33:14,771 --> 00:33:16,570
Good work. Thanks, Tatleen.

491
00:33:16,983 --> 00:33:18,823
Ma'am, we've got the COM.

492
00:33:20,863 --> 00:33:23,490
Deputy Chief Constable Wise will
answer any further questions.

493
00:33:26,011 --> 00:33:30,570
I want to reiterate this force's
gratitude to the officers involved.

494
00:33:30,571 --> 00:33:32,450
- At this stage...
- Turn that bloody thing off!

495
00:33:32,451 --> 00:33:34,211
...to rule out links to previous...

496
00:33:44,251 --> 00:33:45,850
Cheers.

497
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:48,890
- Inspector Cameron?
- Yeah.

498
00:33:48,891 --> 00:33:51,072
DS Arnott, AC-12.

499
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:54,503
My DI and I need to speak to you
about Operation Pear Tree.

500
00:33:56,251 --> 00:33:58,050
Can we talk outside please, Ma'am?

501
00:33:58,051 --> 00:34:00,130
I don't have anything to say to AC-12.

502
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:03,370
Inspector, we can do this
the easy way or the hard way.

503
00:34:03,743 --> 00:34:05,131
It's your choice, Ma'am.

504
00:34:23,171 --> 00:34:25,011
DI Kate Fleming.

505
00:34:26,371 --> 00:34:27,770
What do you want to know?

506
00:34:27,771 --> 00:34:30,410
You were John Corbett's
covert-ops manager.

507
00:34:30,983 --> 00:34:32,066
I was.

508
00:34:32,091 --> 00:34:33,791
Communications between
yourself and Corbett

509
00:34:33,792 --> 00:34:36,210
dried up about three months ago.
Why was that?

510
00:34:36,211 --> 00:34:38,050
John does things his own way.

511
00:34:38,051 --> 00:34:40,370
He wasn't too happy how
the operation was being led.

512
00:34:40,371 --> 00:34:42,610
What specifically was he unhappy about?

513
00:34:42,611 --> 00:34:45,210
Why you asking? It's all in the files.

514
00:34:45,623 --> 00:34:47,730
That's the point, Ma'am, it isn't.

515
00:34:48,383 --> 00:34:50,450
Maybe we shouldn't be having
this conversation.

516
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:54,691
Inspector, this is a lawful inquiry,
it's your duty to cooperate.

517
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:03,410
Why were you reassigned?

518
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:07,230
Powell's version, I'd mismanaged John.

519
00:35:07,591 --> 00:35:09,610
Failed to keep him onside.

520
00:35:10,023 --> 00:35:12,531
This is your chance
to put the record straight.

521
00:35:16,891 --> 00:35:19,570
John thought Pear Tree was
showing signs of mission drift.

522
00:35:19,571 --> 00:35:21,810
- I agreed with him.
- Drifting how?

523
00:35:21,811 --> 00:35:26,268
Our brief was to identify high-level
links between organised crime

524
00:35:26,269 --> 00:35:27,930
and corrupt police officers.

525
00:35:27,931 --> 00:35:31,410
Instead, Powell was pushing us in
the direction of low-level targets.

526
00:35:31,411 --> 00:35:33,970
What was discussed in your last
communications with Corbett?

527
00:35:34,463 --> 00:35:37,210
John planned to climb up
through the ranks of the OCG.

528
00:35:37,211 --> 00:35:40,204
He's a bright bloke, a natural leader.

529
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:42,450
He reckoned that was the only way
of making contact

530
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:44,890
with the highest echelon
of corrupt officers.

531
00:35:44,891 --> 00:35:47,450
And then Powell vetoed the plan?

532
00:35:47,451 --> 00:35:49,890
That's when John threw his toys
and we lost contact.

533
00:35:49,891 --> 00:35:51,570
Right. So, was there ever any intel

534
00:35:51,571 --> 00:35:54,050
from Corbett on high-ranking,
corrupt officers?

535
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:55,890
He believed he was on to the top man.

536
00:35:55,891 --> 00:35:57,130
Who?

537
00:35:57,623 --> 00:35:59,050
It was just a codename.

538
00:35:59,543 --> 00:36:02,291
Didn't even think it was real. H?

539
00:36:05,971 --> 00:36:07,583
Thanks, Inspector.

540
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,823
Have you got a minute, John?

541
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:24,610
Sure, yeah.

542
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:34,804
All right? All right.

543
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:38,911
You wanted attention, you've got it.

544
00:36:43,857 --> 00:36:45,303
He's here.

545
00:36:53,883 --> 00:36:56,216
_

546
00:36:56,943 --> 00:36:57,930
Who am I talking to?

547
00:36:57,931 --> 00:36:59,291
Just answer.

548
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:05,370
We've seized automatic rifles
from the police.

549
00:37:05,371 --> 00:37:07,570
They've already been processed
through ballistics,

550
00:37:07,571 --> 00:37:09,890
so if they're used,
they'll just be traced straight back

551
00:37:09,891 --> 00:37:11,543
to the police lab, nowhere else.

552
00:37:18,817 --> 00:37:21,287
_

553
00:37:21,287 --> 00:37:22,946
_

554
00:37:22,971 --> 00:37:25,451
We're tooled up, ready for a raid.
I want to plan it.

555
00:37:31,442 --> 00:37:33,442
_

556
00:37:34,771 --> 00:37:36,490
It's the Eastfield Depot.

557
00:37:36,491 --> 00:37:39,450
It's where all the police forces in
the region store seized contraband,

558
00:37:39,451 --> 00:37:42,850
drugs, cash, jewels, precious
metals, but we don't just want

559
00:37:42,851 --> 00:37:45,210
to wait for the transport and
do it in dribs and drabs,

560
00:37:45,211 --> 00:37:48,570
we want to raid the place,
take all the best gear in one go.

561
00:37:49,103 --> 00:37:51,331
This could be bigger than
the Brink's-Mat.

562
00:37:57,131 --> 00:38:00,691
You know, but like you said,
maybe it's too hot to handle.

563
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,359
_

564
00:38:08,851 --> 00:38:11,651
Guess he's going to have
a think about it.

565
00:39:09,491 --> 00:39:12,863
Take the cuffs. Take them!

566
00:39:15,343 --> 00:39:17,691
Open the door. Open the door.

567
00:39:19,317 --> 00:39:20,837
Get in.

568
00:39:22,743 --> 00:39:25,183
Put the cuffs on. Put the cuffs on!

569
00:39:27,623 --> 00:39:29,023
Tie them to that, go on.

570
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:42,810
DS John Corbett. You tried
to make contact with the OCG.

571
00:39:42,811 --> 00:39:45,743
The boys ID'd you. They reckon
you're as straight as an arrow.

572
00:39:46,731 --> 00:39:49,530
- I am.
- Yeah, me, too. I'm doing me job.

573
00:39:49,531 --> 00:39:52,450
I'm investigating high-level
connections between organised crime

574
00:39:52,451 --> 00:39:53,770
and corrupt police officers.

575
00:39:53,771 --> 00:39:56,250
These stunts,
they've just been to get attention.

576
00:39:56,251 --> 00:39:58,448
And I've finally got access
to the top man.

577
00:39:58,449 --> 00:40:00,803
- H?
- I dunno yet.

578
00:40:00,828 --> 00:40:02,467
Contact's via a computer link.

579
00:40:02,468 --> 00:40:04,370
No voice, just text.

580
00:40:04,371 --> 00:40:06,050
But if I can get hold of that computer,

581
00:40:06,051 --> 00:40:07,530
we stand a chance of tracing him.

582
00:40:07,983 --> 00:40:09,490
Why are you telling me all this?

583
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:12,530
I'm carrying all this on me own
here, mate. I need support.

584
00:40:12,531 --> 00:40:15,410
I get nothing off Powell. She's
so scared about what I'll find out.

585
00:40:15,411 --> 00:40:18,543
- She just wants me chasing small fry.
- Small fry like Malhotra?

586
00:40:18,544 --> 00:40:20,530
Keeping that to yourself
got three coppers killed!

587
00:40:20,531 --> 00:40:21,850
Look, if I'd given up Malhotra,

588
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:24,450
the OCG would've known straight off
the bat they had a rat.

589
00:40:24,451 --> 00:40:27,522
- I'm after the big fish.
- Then come back in, work with us.

590
00:40:27,523 --> 00:40:29,530
Look, don't you get it?
That's what they want!

591
00:40:29,531 --> 00:40:31,890
If I come in, they'll charge me
or pension me off

592
00:40:31,891 --> 00:40:33,724
before I get a chance to crack the case.

593
00:40:33,749 --> 00:40:34,930
What they want? Who's they?

594
00:40:34,931 --> 00:40:37,570
The people who don't want the truth
coming out. They give you a job

595
00:40:37,571 --> 00:40:39,810
and then the first thing they do is
cut your balls off.

596
00:40:39,811 --> 00:40:41,690
You've got people killed.
Coppers among 'em.

597
00:40:41,691 --> 00:40:44,370
I've got to keep me cover! I'm
embedded with hardened criminals.

598
00:40:44,371 --> 00:40:46,970
How else do you expect me to
convince them I'm one of their own?

599
00:40:46,971 --> 00:40:48,970
You've crossed a line. You've gone rogue!

600
00:40:48,971 --> 00:40:51,050
Yeah, that's what they want you
to believe!

601
00:40:51,051 --> 00:40:52,570
They again! Who's they?!

602
00:40:52,571 --> 00:40:55,303
Powell! The chiefs! Your boss!

603
00:40:56,651 --> 00:40:58,170
Hastings?

604
00:40:58,171 --> 00:41:01,650
Open your eyes, mate.
Hastings shot dead one of the OCG.

605
00:41:01,651 --> 00:41:03,869
A dozen AFOs had weapons on him.

606
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,128
You seriously telling me

607
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,530
they couldn't have brought him
in for questioning?

608
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:09,148
And Hastings, he doesn't get reprimanded.

609
00:41:09,149 --> 00:41:10,890
The chief gives him a pat on the back!

610
00:41:10,891 --> 00:41:13,330
What the hell's going on there?!

611
00:41:13,331 --> 00:41:16,832
Look, listen to me, mate,
I'm just trying to get to the truth.

612
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:19,555
The top brass,
they don't want me to succeed.

613
00:41:19,556 --> 00:41:23,210
But there's a bent copper running
organised crime, I'm sure of it.

614
00:41:23,211 --> 00:41:25,663
Pull me in and he'll slip
through the net.

615
00:41:26,971 --> 00:41:30,050
Steve, if you're as straight as they
say you are, lad, you'll help me.

616
00:41:30,051 --> 00:41:31,370
Help you how?

617
00:41:31,371 --> 00:41:33,050
Investigate the intel I pass to you.

618
00:41:33,051 --> 00:41:35,170
You killed Maneet and three AFOs!

619
00:41:35,171 --> 00:41:37,083
Not me, mate. They got themselves killed.

620
00:41:37,108 --> 00:41:38,250
You could have stopped it!

621
00:41:38,251 --> 00:41:40,610
The AFOs in the last hijack,
they were all straight.

622
00:41:40,611 --> 00:41:43,610
Fellas like you and me,
just trying to get the job done.

623
00:41:43,611 --> 00:41:46,650
But the first lot, Cafferty's team,
they were all bent!

624
00:41:46,651 --> 00:41:49,023
We checked out Cafferty, she was clean!

625
00:41:54,891 --> 00:41:57,730
Everything I've said's the God's
honest truth, and I'll prove it.

626
00:41:57,731 --> 00:42:00,330
But that depends
if you've got the guts to listen.

627
00:42:00,703 --> 00:42:03,771
Or are you just another lapdog
for Hastings and the rest of them?

628
00:42:28,143 --> 00:42:30,651
Thanks for coming.
I was worried that you mightn't.

629
00:42:31,971 --> 00:42:34,021
Looking you in the eye, least I could do.

630
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:37,610
Right, well, let's get a wee drink
here, settle the nerves, you know.

631
00:42:37,611 --> 00:42:42,210
Ted? Can we just... talk calmly,
like grown-ups?

632
00:42:42,211 --> 00:42:43,890
Yeah, yeah. Of course, of course.

633
00:42:43,891 --> 00:42:46,170
That's why we're here,
just to talk things through.

634
00:42:46,543 --> 00:42:48,330
I mean, that solicitor, you know,

635
00:42:48,331 --> 00:42:50,890
it's her fault, you know,
this thing got out of hand.

636
00:42:51,543 --> 00:42:54,011
Ted, it's no-one's fault but ours.

637
00:42:55,651 --> 00:42:57,251
Mine.

638
00:42:58,571 --> 00:43:01,210
Look, I never meant for this to happen.

639
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,610
I just wanted us to have a better future.

640
00:43:03,611 --> 00:43:06,811
One bad decision, you know, one bad
investment, is that, you know...

641
00:43:08,011 --> 00:43:11,343
...is that any excuse to throw away
35 years of marriage?

642
00:43:11,971 --> 00:43:13,423
37.

643
00:43:13,771 --> 00:43:15,730
There you go.
Come on, let's grab a table.

644
00:43:15,731 --> 00:43:17,890
No, I'm not here to eat.

645
00:43:18,204 --> 00:43:20,044
I, um...

646
00:43:24,823 --> 00:43:27,090
...I'm here to ask you one more time
to sign the papers.

647
00:43:31,057 --> 00:43:32,537
We made vows.

648
00:43:35,664 --> 00:43:37,144
A man needs a wife.

649
00:43:42,971 --> 00:43:44,771
I've met someone else.

650
00:43:53,491 --> 00:43:56,930
Now, listen, love, things have
taken an unexpected turn, you know.

651
00:43:56,931 --> 00:43:59,370
An unexpected turn for the better.

652
00:43:59,371 --> 00:44:00,610
All the money that I invested,

653
00:44:00,611 --> 00:44:02,810
there's a good chance
that I can get some of that back.

654
00:44:02,811 --> 00:44:05,343
Not just some of it, but all of it.

655
00:44:06,331 --> 00:44:08,290
You want a better future, you have it.

656
00:44:09,023 --> 00:44:10,543
I found mine.

657
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:21,990
Sign the papers, Ted.

658
00:45:23,131 --> 00:45:25,690
Boss? I've been thinking,

659
00:45:25,691 --> 00:45:28,530
maybe we should put surveillance
on Cafferty's place.

660
00:45:29,063 --> 00:45:30,370
Any particular reason?

661
00:45:30,371 --> 00:45:32,890
Well, the OCG will be worried
she can ID the female nominal.

662
00:45:32,891 --> 00:45:34,770
Maybe they'll try and finish the job.

663
00:45:34,771 --> 00:45:37,063
- OK, I'll think about it.
- Cheers.

664
00:45:51,383 --> 00:45:53,930
I need you to drop these
to Cafferty for me.

665
00:45:54,343 --> 00:45:56,204
She came through for us on the hijack.

666
00:45:56,205 --> 00:45:57,943
I want to keep her sweet.

667
00:45:58,571 --> 00:46:00,557
What about the copper on the door?

668
00:46:00,558 --> 00:46:02,971
He's all right, he's one of ours.

669
00:46:06,491 --> 00:46:08,291
Come on, lad, places to go.

670
00:46:10,131 --> 00:46:11,650
No, this...

671
00:46:13,051 --> 00:46:14,718
...this don't feel right.

672
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:16,490
I know what you mean, mate.

673
00:46:16,491 --> 00:46:18,930
I trust Cafferty as far
as I could throw her,

674
00:46:18,931 --> 00:46:20,770
but this is to flush her out.

675
00:46:21,383 --> 00:46:25,143
If you smell a rat,
do anything necessary.

676
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:28,490
Anything?

677
00:46:30,044 --> 00:46:31,564
Fill your boots.

678
00:46:32,971 --> 00:46:34,331
Hm!

679
00:47:15,371 --> 00:47:17,196
45-64, go.

680
00:47:17,197 --> 00:47:19,223
- 64, received.
- Go!

681
00:47:24,572 --> 00:47:26,657
- Armed police!
- Police! Don't resist!

682
00:47:26,682 --> 00:47:28,610
Turn around and face the wall!

683
00:47:28,611 --> 00:47:30,609
What you done? Have you grassed on us?!

684
00:47:30,634 --> 00:47:31,755
No!

685
00:47:32,571 --> 00:47:34,383
Move back! Back!

686
00:47:35,051 --> 00:47:37,290
- Face the wall!
- OK, clear!

687
00:47:37,291 --> 00:47:38,970
On your knees! Do not move!

688
00:47:38,971 --> 00:47:41,250
- Upstairs!
- On me! Armed police!

689
00:47:41,251 --> 00:47:42,810
Armed police!

690
00:47:42,811 --> 00:47:44,970
Do not move! Hands where I can see them!

691
00:47:44,971 --> 00:47:46,260
Armed police!

692
00:47:46,285 --> 00:47:47,972
Do not move! Hands where I can see them!

693
00:47:47,973 --> 00:47:50,210
I am a police officer, I am cooperating!

694
00:47:50,211 --> 00:47:51,543
Clear for entry.

695
00:47:52,291 --> 00:47:54,250
Cuff him, get him out of here.

696
00:47:54,783 --> 00:47:58,770
That man who was just in here,
I have never seen him before.

697
00:47:59,691 --> 00:48:01,211
Look around.

698
00:48:23,623 --> 00:48:25,202
Jane Cafferty, I'm arresting you

699
00:48:25,203 --> 00:48:27,248
on suspicion of misconduct in
a public office.

700
00:48:27,249 --> 00:48:29,463
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

701
00:48:29,464 --> 00:48:30,963
if you do not mention when questioned

702
00:48:30,964 --> 00:48:32,823
something you later rely on in court.

703
00:48:37,011 --> 00:48:40,122
- What the hell happened?
- Lee just said he had to go out.

704
00:48:40,123 --> 00:48:42,210
- Who with?!
- He didn't say.

705
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:43,970
Where's John?!

706
00:48:44,931 --> 00:48:46,450
Your boy Lee, he best know the score!

707
00:48:46,451 --> 00:48:48,010
- He won't talk, John.
- He'd better not.

708
00:48:48,011 --> 00:48:50,530
So, how come the police knew
he was there in the first place?!

709
00:48:51,063 --> 00:48:53,370
Maybe they still
had their suspicions about Cafferty.

710
00:48:53,371 --> 00:48:55,330
They must have kept
surveillance on the house.

711
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:57,400
Bollocks!

712
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:58,650
No, we've got a rat.

713
00:48:58,651 --> 00:49:00,810
Get out there and find out who's grassed!

714
00:49:01,383 --> 00:49:03,530
- OK, John, yeah, sure.
- Come on, then, move!

715
00:49:03,531 --> 00:49:05,583
OK, mate, no worries, yeah?

716
00:49:06,731 --> 00:49:10,970
Hey! That's not a word we throw around.

717
00:49:10,971 --> 00:49:13,330
This unit used to be run by Tommy Hunter.

718
00:49:13,331 --> 00:49:15,050
Before your time.

719
00:49:15,051 --> 00:49:17,530
Tommy got immunity,
witness protection, the works.

720
00:49:18,217 --> 00:49:19,817
We still got to him.

721
00:49:20,597 --> 00:49:21,957
That's what happens to a rat.

722
00:49:44,183 --> 00:49:45,370
I'm alone.

723
00:49:45,943 --> 00:49:48,303
Don't worry, mate,
I know how to make sure of that.

724
00:49:48,823 --> 00:49:51,050
Did it all work out how I told you?

725
00:49:51,051 --> 00:49:53,370
Look, don't take the piss, mate,
it did, didn't it?!

726
00:49:53,371 --> 00:49:55,490
I'd never get an honest copper
killed, mate.

727
00:49:55,491 --> 00:49:56,810
The bent ones, they deserve it.

728
00:49:56,811 --> 00:49:59,102
They're vermin, the lot of them.
Right to the top.

729
00:49:59,103 --> 00:50:01,970
Maneet wasn't bent, she was trying
to do the right thing.

730
00:50:01,971 --> 00:50:05,104
I'm doing the right thing!
I'm doing more right than anyone!

731
00:50:05,105 --> 00:50:08,050
Look, if it wasn't for me,
they'd all go free, H included!

732
00:50:08,051 --> 00:50:10,970
Think, mate. Maneet didn't reach out
to you or anyone else.

733
00:50:10,971 --> 00:50:13,530
She never told you what
she was up to. And why was that?

734
00:50:13,531 --> 00:50:17,090
Because Hastings forced her out,
and you lot backed him!

735
00:50:17,263 --> 00:50:19,703
Look, she's dead just as much
because of you!

736
00:50:21,091 --> 00:50:22,650
Now, put it right, mate.

737
00:50:23,423 --> 00:50:25,450
Yeah? Do this for her.

738
00:50:25,823 --> 00:50:28,411
We'll go after the bent bastards,
whatever it takes.

739
00:50:29,611 --> 00:50:32,463
But once you're in,
there's no turning back.

740
00:50:34,684 --> 00:50:35,924
Are you in?

741
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:40,490
All right.

742
00:51:04,771 --> 00:51:06,330
Wait there, please.

743
00:51:06,331 --> 00:51:08,063
Evening...

744
00:51:12,343 --> 00:51:15,370
I never would've guessed we'd get
so much out of watching Cafferty.

745
00:51:16,396 --> 00:51:17,398
Yeah.

746
00:51:17,891 --> 00:51:20,490
I've been developing a CHIS
who hears things about the OCG.

747
00:51:20,491 --> 00:51:22,610
I wasn't sure if it was going to
pan out or not.

748
00:51:22,983 --> 00:51:25,890
- Someone I should know about?
- No. Low level.

749
00:51:26,343 --> 00:51:28,370
Definitely not something
to bother a DI about.

750
00:51:28,371 --> 00:51:30,451
Hm. Just the way I like it.

751
00:51:38,251 --> 00:51:40,450
PS Cafferty, you remain under caution.

752
00:51:40,451 --> 00:51:44,250
For the DIR, I'm showing
the interview Image 19.

753
00:51:44,251 --> 00:51:45,763
At the time of your arrest,

754
00:51:45,788 --> 00:51:48,290
you were in the company
of the person shown in Image 19,

755
00:51:48,291 --> 00:51:49,970
identified as Lee Banks,

756
00:51:49,971 --> 00:51:52,170
a known criminal with
a history of violent offences

757
00:51:52,171 --> 00:51:55,570
and a longstanding association
with an organised crime group.

758
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:57,131
How do you know Banks?

759
00:51:59,291 --> 00:52:01,890
I have never met Lee Banks before today.

760
00:52:01,891 --> 00:52:04,690
He gained entry to my home
by false pretences.

761
00:52:04,691 --> 00:52:09,327
Image 31 on screen shows
Item JD5 detected at your address.

762
00:52:09,328 --> 00:52:13,050
JD5 is an envelope containing £5,000
in £50 notes.

763
00:52:13,051 --> 00:52:15,923
How do you account for
JD5 being in your home?

764
00:52:16,587 --> 00:52:17,772
That was Banks again.

765
00:52:17,773 --> 00:52:20,063
He must have placed the item there
without my knowledge.

766
00:52:22,703 --> 00:52:25,504
In 2015, were you engaged in
an extramarital affair

767
00:52:25,505 --> 00:52:26,924
you were determined to keep secret?

768
00:52:26,925 --> 00:52:29,650
DS Arnott, this line of questioning
is irrelevant and oppressive.

769
00:52:29,651 --> 00:52:31,410
Were you contacted by a representative

770
00:52:31,411 --> 00:52:32,650
of an organised crime group

771
00:52:32,651 --> 00:52:34,770
in connection with
your extramarital affair?

772
00:52:34,771 --> 00:52:36,370
Jane, you don't have to say anything.

773
00:52:36,371 --> 00:52:39,623
Sergeant, assist with our inquiry
and it will be taken into account.

774
00:52:49,223 --> 00:52:50,823
They even had photos.

775
00:52:52,024 --> 00:52:53,584
Photos of you and your lover?

776
00:52:54,531 --> 00:52:57,211
CCTV from a pub car park.

777
00:52:59,811 --> 00:53:02,423
God knows how they got them.
They were going to show my husband.

778
00:53:03,383 --> 00:53:08,450
Everyone in my phone contacts,
the... parents at my kids' school.

779
00:53:09,183 --> 00:53:11,610
And to stop them
distributing the photos...?

780
00:53:12,303 --> 00:53:13,863
They wanted information...

781
00:53:14,971 --> 00:53:16,570
...on police operations.

782
00:53:16,571 --> 00:53:18,690
Little things at first and then...

783
00:53:19,223 --> 00:53:20,930
...it got bigger.

784
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:23,930
Bigger as in the Transport
of Seized Goods ED-905?

785
00:53:24,583 --> 00:53:25,610
Yes.

786
00:53:26,383 --> 00:53:27,823
So, how did that work, then?

787
00:53:29,771 --> 00:53:32,530
They already knew about the shipment
from another source,

788
00:53:32,983 --> 00:53:36,730
a civilian administrator
who organised the transport.

789
00:53:36,731 --> 00:53:40,539
And then they put pressure on me
to rearrange the work schedules

790
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:42,210
so that it would be my team responsible

791
00:53:42,211 --> 00:53:44,170
for escorting the transport lorry.

792
00:53:44,943 --> 00:53:48,050
Yeah, which got three innocent
members of your team killed.

793
00:53:48,051 --> 00:53:49,650
They weren't innocent.

794
00:53:49,651 --> 00:53:51,250
What, they were in on it, too?

795
00:53:51,823 --> 00:53:53,450
Kevin and Ray were on the take.

796
00:53:54,103 --> 00:53:57,250
Carl had a... taste for prostitutes.

797
00:53:58,063 --> 00:54:02,063
We thought we were just going to get
minor injuries. Tied up and...

798
00:54:03,291 --> 00:54:06,868
The OCG crossed us. They obviously
didn't trust us to keep quiet

799
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:09,023
during the investigation
that was bound to follow.

800
00:54:10,823 --> 00:54:15,290
And the recent hijack, the firearms,
what can you tell us about that?

801
00:54:15,983 --> 00:54:20,290
While I was off sick,
I was still talking to other AFOs.

802
00:54:20,703 --> 00:54:24,383
Everyone was rattled after ED-905,
so there was a lot of talk.

803
00:54:25,651 --> 00:54:28,010
I found out about the transport

804
00:54:28,011 --> 00:54:30,890
and the OCG sent someone
masquerading as a nurse

805
00:54:30,891 --> 00:54:34,290
to blackmail me
into revealing the details.

806
00:54:34,291 --> 00:54:37,210
They didn't just have the affair
to threaten me with,

807
00:54:37,211 --> 00:54:39,903
they had the fact I'd been
complicit in the first hijack.

808
00:54:43,263 --> 00:54:45,010
Who did the blackmailing?

809
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:48,331
A woman. 20s, mixed race.

810
00:54:51,891 --> 00:54:54,229
The person who first recruited you,

811
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:57,090
the one who brought you into
this network of corrupt officers

812
00:54:57,091 --> 00:55:00,410
assisting organised crime, was it
this woman you've just described,

813
00:55:00,411 --> 00:55:01,890
or this man, Lee Banks?

814
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,503
Neither.

815
00:55:08,117 --> 00:55:09,477
A police officer?

816
00:55:10,944 --> 00:55:12,303
I think so.

817
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:15,690
Stay here.

818
00:55:16,571 --> 00:55:19,371
DI Fleming is temporarily
leaving the room.

819
00:56:04,107 --> 00:56:07,730
For the DIR, I am showing
PS Cafferty a series of images.

820
00:56:08,103 --> 00:56:09,611
KF1.

821
00:56:10,611 --> 00:56:12,131
KF2.

822
00:56:13,904 --> 00:56:15,224
KF3.

823
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:21,664
KF5.

824
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:26,510
KF6.

825
00:56:28,863 --> 00:56:32,012
KF1-KF6 are a series of images
of individuals

826
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:36,010
known to be part of a clandestine
network of corrupt police officers.

827
00:56:36,011 --> 00:56:37,530
I'm doing so in the full knowledge

828
00:56:37,531 --> 00:56:40,090
that any photo ID would not be
evidential at this stage.

829
00:56:40,091 --> 00:56:42,583
- DS Arnott, agreed?
- Agreed, Ma'am.

830
00:56:43,943 --> 00:56:46,543
PS Cafferty, do you see the person
who recruited you?

831
00:56:47,305 --> 00:57:47,229

1
00:00:02,561 --> 00:00:05,560
The target of the 5th September
ambush was a protected witness.

2
00:00:05,561 --> 00:00:09,932
John Thomas Hunter.
He used the name Alex Campbell.

3
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:12,948
DS Akers was the person
closest to him.

4
00:00:12,949 --> 00:00:16,633
I need a safe and available
destination ASAP.

5
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:22,305
You're facing a charge of conspiracy
to murder. That's a life sentence.

6
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:25,211
I'm not going to be in here
for life - I'm innocent.

7
00:00:25,212 --> 00:00:28,664
We had a deal -
immunity from prosecution,

8
00:00:28,702 --> 00:00:29,946
you two-faced bastard.

9
00:00:30,003 --> 00:00:34,635
Deputy Chief Constable Dryden,
Tommy's "two-faced bastard".

10
00:00:34,705 --> 00:00:38,705
We believe these photos were used by
John Thomas Hunter to blackmail you.

11
00:00:41,745 --> 00:00:43,724
What happened to Cole?

12
00:00:43,725 --> 00:00:45,701
Prasad murdered him.

13
00:00:47,574 --> 00:00:50,462
The suspect has asked me
to record his dying declaration.

14
00:00:50,552 --> 00:00:51,703
'I carried out the ambush

15
00:00:51,704 --> 00:00:54,692
'under orders from
Deputy Chief Constable Dryden.'

16
00:00:56,688 --> 00:00:59,707
You are going down
for a long time, fella.

17
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:02,149
I request immunity from prosecution.

19
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,667
What about this other officer,
the Caddy?

20
00:01:06,668 --> 00:01:08,679
Apparently Cole likes
to wear golf jumpers,

21
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,663
but he's never played the game.
Hence, the Caddy.

22
00:01:12,664 --> 00:01:13,688
Nice one.

23
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:18,358
What is it? Tracking device.

24
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:21,669
We were investigating Denton.
The whole time it didn't matter
what route she took that night,

25
00:01:21,712 --> 00:01:23,688
the ambushers were tracking Akers!

26
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,668
DI Denton's medical records.

27
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,711
'Unconfirmed sources
allege that the suspect

28
00:01:34,712 --> 00:01:37,676
'is Deputy Chief Constable
Mike Dryden.'

29
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:43,739
You were the last person to see
Carly Kirk before she disappeared -

30
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,715
the last person to see a girl
who's later found buried

31
00:01:46,716 --> 00:01:48,684
under the industrial unit.

32
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:53,667
You instigated a conspiracy
that led to the deaths

33
00:01:53,668 --> 00:01:56,684
of four police officers.
The only conspiracy is against me!

34

Let us commend Elizabeth
to the mercy of God.

36
00:02:13,696 --> 00:02:17,715
We therefore commit her body to
the ground, earth to earth,

37
00:02:17,716 --> 00:02:20,679
ashes to ashes, dust to dust,

38
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,704
in the sure and certain hope of
the resurrection to eternal life.

39
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:32,671
You recorded a dying declaration in
which you stated that the ambush

40
00:02:32,672 --> 00:02:36,651
was carried out on the orders of
Deputy Chief Constable Michael Dryden.

41
00:02:36,652 --> 00:02:38,723
That statement was made
under fear for my life,

42
00:02:38,724 --> 00:02:40,735
when I would have said anything.

43
00:02:40,736 --> 00:02:42,723
I retract.

44
00:02:42,724 --> 00:02:44,656
Mother of God.

45
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,647
So, who did order the ambush?

46
00:02:48,648 --> 00:02:49,716
I'm not getting into that.

47
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,644
So what about these photos
of Dryden and Carly Kirk?

48
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,680
It's covered.

49
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:03,707
I confirm that
Tommy Hunter engaged me

50
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:06,671
for the purpose of acquiring
incriminating photographs.

51
00:03:06,672 --> 00:03:10,647
Great. Fine. Good. But this is
where my head starts spinning.

52
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:11,695
Because you're Tommy's man,

53
00:03:11,696 --> 00:03:14,687
and yet here you are involved
with trying to kill him.

54
00:03:14,688 --> 00:03:18,675
Tommy was blackmailing the
Deputy Chief Constable, right?

55
00:03:18,676 --> 00:03:21,735
And if he'd do that to keep his
immunity, what else would he do?

56
00:03:21,736 --> 00:03:24,695
There was a school of thought
that maybe we'd be better off

57
00:03:24,696 --> 00:03:27,679
with Tommy out of the picture.
Who's "we"?

58
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,691
Various parties associated with
Tommy's past, you know?

59
00:03:30,692 --> 00:03:33,723
Well, other departments can follow
those particular lines of inquiry.

60
00:03:33,724 --> 00:03:36,739
We are only interested in
one thing and one thing only -

61
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,736
and that is bent coppers.

62
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,712
Thanks, Steve.
No problem.

63
00:03:48,676 --> 00:03:50,659
I really appreciated this.

64
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,679
I would've hated to have had a couple
of uniforms standing next to me

65
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,716
at the graveside.

66
00:03:55,716 --> 00:03:57,656
It's fine.

67
00:03:59,716 --> 00:04:02,707
Can I ask you one more favour?
Sure.

68
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:05,704
Do you mind going... just
going by the nursing home?

69
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:10,687
They want to send
my mum's... personal effects,

70
00:04:10,688 --> 00:04:12,668
and I'd rather go
and get them myself.

71
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,648
I'll get the authority.

72
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,683
We're going to name you
some police officers,

73
00:04:22,684 --> 00:04:25,727
and you are going to tell us what
crime or crimes they committed.

74
00:04:25,728 --> 00:04:27,671
Have you got it?

75
00:04:27,672 --> 00:04:31,655
We're going to start with Deputy
Chief Constable Michael Dryden.

76
00:04:31,656 --> 00:04:34,671
Dryden got himself
blown by the girl.

77
00:04:34,672 --> 00:04:35,708
Did he kill her?

78
00:04:37,716 --> 00:04:39,663
To confirm the agreement,

79
00:04:39,664 --> 00:04:44,656
any evidence that you give in this
regard is immune from prosecution.

80
00:04:47,724 --> 00:04:50,683
We had the photos...

81
00:04:50,684 --> 00:04:53,659
but we needed the threat of
the girl being able to testify

82
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,679
to really turn the screw.

83
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,723
But she did a runner.

84
00:04:57,724 --> 00:04:59,663
So you killed her?

85
00:04:59,664 --> 00:05:01,723
Are you listening to me?
She did a runner.

86
00:05:01,724 --> 00:05:03,655
And so what did you do?

87
00:05:03,656 --> 00:05:05,707
We got another body, dressed her up
in a waitress' uniform,

88
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,644
and took photos.

89
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,687
This body... Another girl.

90
00:05:10,688 --> 00:05:13,688
Who? Just some little
slapper that fit the bill.

91
00:05:27,712 --> 00:05:29,703
Put this case anywhere
before I go?

92
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,671
Yeah, if you wouldn't mind.
It's just, erm...

93
00:05:32,672 --> 00:05:35,676
up the stairs, it's the room
at the front of the house.

94
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,696
Bye.

95
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,716
Bye.

96
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:06,663
Look, DS Jayne Akers,
the witness protection officer,

97
00:06:06,664 --> 00:06:07,707
how'd she get involved?

98
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,720
There's a middleman.
Who?

99
00:06:11,684 --> 00:06:15,671
I never met him. We just
talked over payphones.

100
00:06:15,672 --> 00:06:17,663
No name.

101
00:06:17,664 --> 00:06:18,715
He fixed Akers.

102
00:06:18,716 --> 00:06:21,659
So Akers knew who he was?

103
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,683
Was this why Akers was killed?

104
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:24,739
She knew names.

105
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,648
This middleman. We have
DC Jeremy Cole named as the Caddy.

106
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,699
Cole couldn't organise
a piss-up in a brewery.

107
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,668
So he wasn't the Caddy?

108
00:06:36,716 --> 00:06:38,696
Well, if he was, it's news to me.

109
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,643
One final name we're interested in
is DI Lindsay Denton.

110
00:06:43,644 --> 00:06:47,664
What about her? At the ambush,
why was DI Lindsay Denton spared?

111
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:54,687
All I know, there was an order.

112
00:06:54,688 --> 00:06:56,715
What was the order?

113
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,668
"Don't hurt Denton."

114
00:07:10,676 --> 00:07:12,691
I'm sorry about your mum.

115
00:07:12,692 --> 00:07:13,708
Thanks.

116
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,679
We're going to show you CCTV

117
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,728
captured on the evening
of the 16th of August.

118
00:07:20,668 --> 00:07:23,656
It shows Dryden and Prasad
at an event at City Hall.

119
00:07:25,728 --> 00:07:28,644
I'm now going to fast-forward a bit.

120
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:37,687
Oh, my God. That's Carly.

121
00:07:37,688 --> 00:07:41,647
I now want to show you
another image from the same night.

122
00:07:41,648 --> 00:07:44,652
This is the security camera
at the City Hall car park.

123
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,648
It shows Dryden leaving with Carly.

124
00:07:50,676 --> 00:07:53,691
You were investigating
the disappearance of Carly Kirk,

125
00:07:53,692 --> 00:07:55,663
this is crucial evidence.

126
00:07:55,664 --> 00:07:57,715
You must be frustrated
you didn't find it earlier.

127
00:07:57,716 --> 00:07:59,723
Extremely frustrated.

128
00:07:59,724 --> 00:08:02,683
Well, we're now in a position to
inform you of a development

129
00:08:02,684 --> 00:08:05,683
with the body found
under the garage floor.

130
00:08:05,684 --> 00:08:07,739
Have they confirmed that it's her?

131
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,740
The opposite - it isn't her.

132
00:08:14,664 --> 00:08:18,659
Well... that's wonderful.

133
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,708
She means a lot to you,
doesn't she, ma'am?

134
00:08:21,716 --> 00:08:24,704
Well, why wouldn't the life
of a child mean a lot to anyone?

135
00:08:29,684 --> 00:08:33,723
I didn't know this was happening.
Sit down. The more, the merrier.

136
00:08:33,724 --> 00:08:35,731
Thank you, DI Denton.

137
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:39,688
You OK? I said sit down,
for the second time, DS Arnott.

138
00:08:48,652 --> 00:08:51,643
We'll now show you
the second vehicle captured

139
00:08:51,644 --> 00:08:52,884
leaving the City Hall car park.

140
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,716
What does this image show?
You can't do this.

141
00:09:01,648 --> 00:09:03,712
Are you prepared to answer that
question, DI Denton?

142
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,656
The image shows me.

143
00:09:12,648 --> 00:09:13,769
Why were you there, Lindsay?

144
00:09:16,704 --> 00:09:21,643
Mike wasn't returning my calls.
I went there to confront him.

145
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,735
In a public space,
he would have to avoid a scene.

146
00:09:23,736 --> 00:09:25,703
So instead you followed him.

147
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:28,699
No, I didn't. I was upset.
I went straight home.

148
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,691
What upset you?

149
00:09:30,692 --> 00:09:32,727
Seeing him.
Seeing him with Carly Kirk?

150
00:09:32,728 --> 00:09:35,671
I saw Mike at the function.
I didn't see Carly.

151
00:09:35,672 --> 00:09:37,659
No? Well, they're
right in front of you.

152
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,703
Kate. She's answered.

153
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:41,659
I absolutely didn't see that Carly
was in the car with him.

154
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,687
Do you seriously expect us
to believe that?

155
00:09:44,688 --> 00:09:47,739
The first thing I knew about Carly
Kirk was when I was put on her case.

156
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,671
After the ambush.
Before that, I knew nothing.

157
00:09:51,672 --> 00:09:54,695
If I had, I'd have investigated.
There'd be evidence on my hard drive.

158
00:09:54,696 --> 00:09:56,664
We looked. There wasn't any.

159
00:09:58,692 --> 00:09:59,712
It's fine.

160
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:04,736
Thank you, DI Denton.

161
00:10:06,676 --> 00:10:10,703
We'll place this interview in the
case file and submit it to the CPS.

162
00:10:10,704 --> 00:10:12,728
Glad to have been of help, sir.

163
00:10:14,728 --> 00:10:16,672
I'll give you a lift home.

164
00:10:53,712 --> 00:10:57,679
I've had an opportunity
to discuss your case file

165
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,675
with the Crown Prosecutor

166
00:10:59,676 --> 00:11:02,724
and I have been authorised by her
to proceed as follows.

167
00:11:03,724 --> 00:11:08,651
In respect of conspiracy to murder
a protected witness -

168
00:11:08,652 --> 00:11:10,731
on the grounds of
insufficient evidence,

169
00:11:10,732 --> 00:11:13,735
there will be no charge
at this time.

170
00:11:13,736 --> 00:11:16,736
In respect of
sexual activity with a child -

171
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,671
..on the grounds
of insufficient evidence,

172
00:11:21,672 --> 00:11:24,659
there will be no charge
at this time.

173
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,679
In respect of perverting
the course of justice,

174
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,643
in relation to your wife's driving
offence, you will be charged now.

175
00:11:33,644 --> 00:11:37,659
The Custody Officer has been
authorised to release you

176
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,663
on conditional bail.
And in the meantime

177
00:11:40,664 --> 00:11:43,739
I will submit your case file
to the Crown Prosecution Service.

178
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,704
Interview terminated.

179
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,736
I'll fight this.

180
00:11:52,656 --> 00:11:55,659
The Crown Prosecutor and I are
of a mind to believe that you were

181
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,727
knowingly establishing an alibi
for your activities with Carly Kirk.

182
00:11:59,728 --> 00:12:03,735
Now, the Crown Prosecutor may not
feel that there was enough evidence.

183
00:12:03,736 --> 00:12:06,688
As for me,
I would throw the book at you.

184
00:12:07,716 --> 00:12:09,688
That wee girl, she was only 15.

185
00:12:12,652 --> 00:12:15,656
Come on. We're done here.
Ted. Wait. Please.

186
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,740
If you wouldn't mind.

187
00:12:22,656 --> 00:12:23,720
Thank you, Kate.

188
00:12:27,648 --> 00:12:29,731
I've made a catastrophic
error of judgment.

189
00:12:29,732 --> 00:12:32,711
And I need to make amends.

190
00:12:32,712 --> 00:12:35,691
You and Les Hargreaves still
haven't found out

191
00:12:35,692 --> 00:12:37,671
who orchestrated the ambush.

192
00:12:37,672 --> 00:12:39,711
You've got to get to
the bottom of this, Ted.

193
00:12:39,712 --> 00:12:42,703
I don't want my last, most important
case to end in failure.

194
00:12:42,704 --> 00:12:44,711
There are things I can do to help.

195
00:12:44,712 --> 00:12:46,648
If you say so.

196
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,659
This is now
a voluntary intelligence interview.

197
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,732
Go and make sure they
don't cock up bail. You sure? Yes.

198
00:12:55,732 --> 00:12:57,707
What's he up to?

199
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,672
Oldest trick in the book.

200
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:12,707
You've got the gunmen but you need
the people who ordered the ambush.

201
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,648
I can be of help.

202
00:13:16,704 --> 00:13:19,707
And if your information was to lead
to a breakthrough...

203
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,715
Then it wouldn't be too much to ask
for the CPS to

204
00:13:21,716 --> 00:13:23,719
look at dropping
the charge against me.

205
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,708
With a nudge from me?

206
00:13:28,712 --> 00:13:33,675
Lindsay Denton was following me the
evening the photographs were taken,

207
00:13:33,676 --> 00:13:37,691
irrespective of what she says or
what the mobile phone evidence says.

208
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,687
I am sick to my back teeth of this
mud-slinging between you

209
00:13:40,688 --> 00:13:43,727
and your bit on the side. I am
talking about a conspiracy here

210
00:13:43,728 --> 00:13:46,715
in which four police officers
were killed!

211
00:13:46,716 --> 00:13:48,676
Listen to me, Ted. Listen.

212
00:13:51,668 --> 00:13:56,647
I gave Carly Kirk a lift
to Edge Park Railway Station.

213
00:13:56,648 --> 00:14:00,683
That's when I saw Lindsay Denton.
There'll be CCTV.

214
00:14:00,684 --> 00:14:04,647
Now, her being there can only
mean that she knows

215
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:07,736
more about the girl, the... entrapment,
the ambush than she's letting on.

216
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:12,711
I'm not being vindictive, Ted.

217
00:14:12,712 --> 00:14:16,648
I just want the guilty parties
brought to justice.

218
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,659
Now, Edge Park's a small station.

219
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,663
This is the only camera that faces
away from the platforms.

220
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:26,691
Now, there's no trains for half an
hour so nothing's coming in or out

221
00:14:26,692 --> 00:14:29,739
but then what appears to be
Dryden's vehicle,

222
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,715
carrying him and Carly, enters.

223
00:14:32,716 --> 00:14:37,715
15 minutes later, Dryden's vehicle
exits at high speed.

224
00:14:37,716 --> 00:14:41,712
Passenger seat's empty. No Carly.
But if we keep going...

225
00:14:44,644 --> 00:14:49,691
..shortly after, an unidentified
vehicle exits the car park.

226
00:14:49,692 --> 00:14:50,740
But if we rewind...

227
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:57,699
..that same vehicle is seen entering
the car park

228
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,655
15 minutes before Dryden's.

229
00:15:00,656 --> 00:15:03,671
This is the vehicle used to obtain
the photos of Dryden and Carly?

230
00:15:03,672 --> 00:15:04,715
Most likely.

231
00:15:04,716 --> 00:15:07,735
Do we have any sighting
of Denton at all?

232
00:15:07,736 --> 00:15:09,652
No.

233
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:15,651
No. She could've been there but just
knew how to avoid the cameras.

234
00:15:15,652 --> 00:15:18,651
Dryden didn't.
What makes Denton so smart?

235
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:20,647
Because she is, Steve.

236
00:15:20,648 --> 00:15:23,719
Well, I see nothing here
to incriminate Denton.

237
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,703
Dot, have you got a minute? Sir.

238
00:15:25,704 --> 00:15:27,735
Get ready, you two,
we've got a meeting to go to.

239
00:15:27,736 --> 00:15:29,672
Yes, sir.

240
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:36,679
Now listen, you and I both know that
Prasad is a lying so-and-so

241
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,739
but he's saying no
to Cole being the Caddy.

242
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,695
Now, the Caddy, as you know,
is the missing link

243
00:15:41,696 --> 00:15:45,691
between the criminal parties and the
corrupt officers, I'm sure of it.

244
00:15:45,692 --> 00:15:47,691
And he's your responsibility,
Matthew.

245
00:15:47,692 --> 00:15:50,723
Sir. Yeah, I'm... I'm on it.

246
00:15:50,724 --> 00:15:52,731
Yeah. Sir.

247
00:15:52,732 --> 00:15:55,700
I will return to it. Yes, sir.

248
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,695
You found a lump on Akers' car,
and you hid it from us.

249
00:16:08,696 --> 00:16:11,667
There were irregularities
with the evidence.

250
00:16:11,668 --> 00:16:12,739
What irregularities?

251
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,735
Forensics on the tracking device
were inconclusive

252
00:16:15,736 --> 00:16:17,704
due to fire damage.

253
00:16:18,696 --> 00:16:21,688
Is that a good enough reason to not
share the evidence?

254
00:16:24,712 --> 00:16:26,720
We'd appreciate those reports.

255
00:16:29,648 --> 00:16:30,695
Jolly?

256
00:16:30,696 --> 00:16:32,659
I'll e-mail them today.

257
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,644
It's all right, have mine.

258
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,695
Ta.

259
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,720
Thank you,
Detective Chief Superintendent. Mm.

260
00:16:44,664 --> 00:16:45,723
We are not the enemy.

261
00:16:45,724 --> 00:16:48,723
Why don't you try telling that
to Mike Dryden, eh?

262
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:50,672
Best boss I've ever had.

263
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:52,712
Come on.

264
00:17:21,672 --> 00:17:24,691
So, this is where
the ambush happened.

265
00:17:24,692 --> 00:17:27,647
Three of our own
killed in cold blood.

266
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:28,723
Poor buggers.

267
00:17:28,724 --> 00:17:31,707
See, I wondered if
you might recognise this place.

268
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,735
Me? Why?

269
00:17:33,736 --> 00:17:38,707
It's because of what we talked about
last time - the Caddy.

270
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,731
Jeremy Cole. Right.

271
00:17:40,732 --> 00:17:44,663
So. Cole. He knew this was
the right place for the set-up.

272
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:47,731
Fast roads, in and out,
far enough out for there to be

273
00:17:47,732 --> 00:17:51,703
no witnesses, not so far that you'd
think you'd en route to Timbuktu.

274
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:52,735
Makes sense.

275
00:17:52,736 --> 00:17:54,715
Now, here's the thing.

276
00:17:54,716 --> 00:17:59,643
If you could go the extra mile
for me, say you came here with Cole,

277
00:17:59,644 --> 00:18:01,692
we could all sign off
from this happy.

278
00:18:02,732 --> 00:18:04,711
How's that work?

279
00:18:04,712 --> 00:18:08,691
Cole brought you here, told you
he had underworld connections,

280
00:18:08,692 --> 00:18:10,707
had had since he was a lad.

281
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:13,724
Thought you might be susceptible
to earning a few quid.

282
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,667
Problem? It's beginning to sound
like something I'd be smart to

283
00:18:20,668 --> 00:18:22,740
stay well out of.
Me too, mate. But I can't.

284
00:18:25,732 --> 00:18:28,719
But that's Anti-Corruption for you.

285
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,683
Hastings never lets anything drop,
does he?

286
00:18:31,684 --> 00:18:32,712
Sorry.

287
00:18:35,676 --> 00:18:38,651
You see, now you've got me worried.

288
00:18:38,652 --> 00:18:40,715
No need. No, but I am, though, I am.

289
00:18:40,716 --> 00:18:42,660
Mate...

290
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,691
Am I, though?

291
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:47,656
A mate? Sure.

292
00:18:50,652 --> 00:18:51,664
Yeah?

293
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,736
OK, then.

294
00:19:05,676 --> 00:19:07,659
"OK, then," what?

295
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,727
I can rely on you. To...?

296
00:19:08,728 --> 00:19:10,731
To provide a statement.

297
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:15,647
You provide a statement saying Cole
boasted of underworld connections

298
00:19:15,648 --> 00:19:17,643
and attempted to recruit you into

299
00:19:17,644 --> 00:19:20,644
a clandestine network
of corrupt police officers.

300
00:19:59,684 --> 00:20:00,728
Shit!

301
00:20:33,648 --> 00:20:34,708
Better not overdo it.

302
00:20:41,656 --> 00:20:43,716
You said you got rid of a cat
because of Dryden.

303
00:20:45,652 --> 00:20:47,687
Why would you bring that up again?

304
00:20:47,688 --> 00:20:50,708
Because AC-12 can access
an officer's medical records.

305
00:20:56,644 --> 00:20:57,672
It wasn't a cat.

306
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,720
Are you going to sit in judgment? No.

307
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,691
First AC-12 make a case against me

308
00:21:06,692 --> 00:21:09,671
because I spent all my money caring
for my mother. And now I'm what?

309
00:21:09,672 --> 00:21:10,720
I'm sorry.

310
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,659
Must've been
very upsetting for you.

311
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:21,724
You think? Bringing something...
alive and lovely into this place...

312
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,684
What happened?

313
00:21:28,692 --> 00:21:30,671
Mike and his wife,

314
00:21:30,672 --> 00:21:33,660
they didn't have kids,
it wasn't part of the plan.

315
00:21:34,684 --> 00:21:36,667
Did you talk to him about it?

316
00:21:36,668 --> 00:21:39,716
I tried. He denied it was his.

317
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:46,703
It must've been very difficult,
coping on your own.

318
00:21:46,704 --> 00:21:48,716
It's the worst thing
I've ever done.

319
00:21:50,648 --> 00:21:51,708
Will be as long as I live.

320
00:22:01,724 --> 00:22:03,676
I'd better go.

321
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,700
You should get some rest. Yeah.

322
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:20,704
I don't sleep.

323
00:22:21,724 --> 00:22:23,664
Do you?

324
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,707
Morning, sir. Morning.

325
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:11,675
So I've had a bit of a problem
with my job motor.

326
00:23:11,676 --> 00:23:14,679
See, my friend, his broke down,
so I lent it him,

327
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,739
tried to do him a favour.

328
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:19,663
Now, the last thing
I want to do is put a bloke in it,

329
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:22,675
but I can't get hold of him...
DC Morton?

330
00:23:22,676 --> 00:23:23,699
Yeah.

331
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,699
DC Morton's just returning
your service vehicle now, sir.

332
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,668
Can you sign me back out?

333
00:23:47,668 --> 00:23:49,663
Find your way home all right?

334
00:23:49,664 --> 00:23:50,692
Eventually.

335
00:23:52,652 --> 00:23:54,724
All got a bit... unnecessary,
don't you think?

336
00:23:56,648 --> 00:23:59,715
Well, I don't know what to think,
to be honest, mate.

337
00:23:59,716 --> 00:24:02,711
Disability benefits,

338
00:24:02,712 --> 00:24:07,643
all the cushy assignments,
none of the brass dare touch me.

339
00:24:07,644 --> 00:24:08,712
Right.

340
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,664
You know my secrets.

341
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,667
Now I know yours.

342
00:24:16,668 --> 00:24:20,736
This was hidden under the back seat.
Unregistered pay-as-you-go.

343
00:24:22,652 --> 00:24:24,671
Lots of interesting numbers.

344
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:27,655
I made a note - won't say where -

345
00:24:27,656 --> 00:24:30,699
just in case someone fancies
digging out your call history.

346
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,680
Plus all the details about last night
in case something happens to me.

347
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,692
That was in the past.

348
00:24:40,648 --> 00:24:41,700
I'm clean now.

349
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:45,716
Me too.

350
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,684
But seems daft to blow
the whistle on each other.

351
00:25:18,736 --> 00:25:20,740
Thank you once again, DI Denton.

352
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:25,739
We've received the forensics report
on the tracker device found

353
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:29,651
under the front left wheel
arch of Akers' vehicle.

354
00:25:29,652 --> 00:25:31,711
There are some irregularities
that need to be explained.

355
00:25:31,712 --> 00:25:32,723
Irregularities?

356
00:25:32,724 --> 00:25:35,663
Well, the tracker would be
expected to retain paint

357
00:25:35,664 --> 00:25:38,655
and metal residues transferred
during its prolonged contact

358
00:25:38,656 --> 00:25:40,719
with the under-surface of
Akers' vehicle.

359
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,691
And it doesn't.

360
00:25:42,692 --> 00:25:45,715
Instead there's a mix of residues,

361
00:25:45,716 --> 00:25:48,675
a proportion of which are
consistent with the underside of

362
00:25:48,676 --> 00:25:53,667
service vehicle -
registration number NV54 OFT.

363
00:25:53,668 --> 00:25:55,663
This being the service vehicle

364
00:25:55,664 --> 00:25:57,739
you were driving
on the night of the ambush.

365
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,719
Uh...

366
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,692
Obviously this is a...
very peculiar finding.

367
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,695
I don't know very much about it,
but I wonder if...

368
00:26:08,696 --> 00:26:14,691
if possibly exposure to the very
high temperatures of the fire
have caused an error.

369
00:26:14,692 --> 00:26:17,740
Open flames typically reach
900 degrees Celsius.

370
00:26:20,736 --> 00:26:23,659
You just said you didn't know
much about it.

371
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,675
No, I... I didn't, I was just taken
aback by the heat of the fire

372
00:26:26,676 --> 00:26:29,667
at the time and it's something I...
looked up afterwards.

373
00:26:29,668 --> 00:26:31,671
Well, picking up on the forensics,
though,

374
00:26:31,672 --> 00:26:33,731
let's speculate on
whether the tracker might not have

375
00:26:33,732 --> 00:26:37,655
been on Akers' vehicle prior to it
being found there that night.

376
00:26:37,656 --> 00:26:40,699
You were a variable. Maybe you'd get
suspicious and ruin the plan.

377
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,672
So they put a tracker on your car.

378
00:26:43,704 --> 00:26:45,651
That's not what happened.

379
00:26:45,652 --> 00:26:47,719
Or you were a scapegoat.
Left alive to carry the blame.

380
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,727
And the tracker
would only add to that.

381
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,667
As I just said,
that's not what happened.

382
00:26:52,668 --> 00:26:56,667
And yet, DI Denton, that's what
the forensics are implying.

383
00:26:56,668 --> 00:26:58,711
With respect, sir, this
conversation can't take place.

384
00:26:58,712 --> 00:27:00,735
You're asking DI Denton
questions relating to

385
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,691
the charge of conspiracy to murder,

386
00:27:02,692 --> 00:27:05,675
questions specifically
off-limits under legal process.

387
00:27:05,676 --> 00:27:07,695
Nobody's accusing Lindsay
of anything here.

388
00:27:07,696 --> 00:27:12,663
She's answering purely as
a witness, DS Arnott. That right?

389
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:13,695
Yeah, of course.

390
00:27:13,696 --> 00:27:16,647
Was it possible that a tracker
could've been placed

391
00:27:16,648 --> 00:27:18,703
under your car
without your knowledge?

392
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:20,655
It's possible.

393
00:27:20,656 --> 00:27:22,691
Because, if you were sure
it couldn't be there,

394
00:27:22,692 --> 00:27:25,676
that would mean you'd checked -
and why would you do that?

395
00:27:32,672 --> 00:27:36,728
Look, I... I'm sorry, do you mind
if I just take a loo break?

396
00:27:38,648 --> 00:27:39,736
Of course. Thank you.

397
00:27:48,728 --> 00:27:50,699
What the hell's this?

398
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,643
Well, we have on record the time
Denton radioed in status zero.

399
00:27:54,644 --> 00:27:57,719
Various figures are bandied about
but the best estimate is between

400
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,695
four and five minutes elapsed
before the blue lights arrived.

401
00:28:01,696 --> 00:28:04,704
Now, if you were her,
what would you do in that time?

402
00:28:06,676 --> 00:28:08,719
My bet is, she found the tracker
and she moved it.

403
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,687
Because that's the one thing that
would prove she was part

404
00:28:11,688 --> 00:28:14,739
of the ambush conspiracy before she
got the emergency call that night.

405
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:19,644
Conspirator or scapegoat, either
way, she was known to the ambushers.

406
00:28:38,644 --> 00:28:39,716
I like your necklace.

407
00:28:41,704 --> 00:28:43,723
Sorry?

408
00:28:43,724 --> 00:28:46,700
Your necklace. It's really pretty.

409
00:29:15,696 --> 00:29:19,699
I can't explain the irregularities
on the forensics.

410
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,671
But you must accept it's possible
that somebody may have placed

411
00:29:22,672 --> 00:29:24,723
the tracker on your vehicle
without your knowledge?

412
00:29:24,724 --> 00:29:26,679
I don't, actually, DC Fleming.

413
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,655
Because that would mean that
I was known to the conspirators

414
00:29:29,656 --> 00:29:31,660
prior to the ambush, and I wasn't.

415
00:29:32,668 --> 00:29:34,712
Well, then why would there be
an order to spare you?

416
00:29:36,728 --> 00:29:39,715
An order to spare me?
Kate, you can't ask this.

417
00:29:39,716 --> 00:29:43,647
I'm sorry, did somebody say
there was an order to spare me?

418
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:45,659
DI Denton,
it would help us considerably

419
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,663
if you would be prepared to
address the issue.

420
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:52,663
I mean, if you'd rather not...
I'm sorry, sir. I just...

421
00:29:52,664 --> 00:29:55,655
I just always wondered
if I was lucky.

422
00:29:55,656 --> 00:29:57,731
But now I realise they...
they must've known

423
00:29:57,732 --> 00:30:01,671
I had nothing to do with it,
and... they planned to let me go.

424
00:30:01,672 --> 00:30:03,667
So you were known to them.

425
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:05,731
They could have used you
to track the convoy.

426
00:30:05,732 --> 00:30:08,735
Which would mean there was a tracker
and it had to have been moved.

427
00:30:08,736 --> 00:30:11,659
Could've been a tracker,
could've been moved.

428
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:14,679
There's no "could've" about it, DI
Denton, that's what forensics says.

429
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,711
Yes, but,
as a word to the wise, sir,

430
00:30:16,712 --> 00:30:19,736
it's legally unacceptable for you
to ask me if I moved it.

431
00:30:22,644 --> 00:30:24,671
Do you know who moved it?

432
00:30:24,672 --> 00:30:27,675
Very good. No, I don't.

433
00:30:27,676 --> 00:30:30,659
Was it moved before
the blue lights arrived?

434
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,683
Akers' car was on fire.

435
00:30:32,684 --> 00:30:35,683
Nobody could get near that car
until the fire was out.

436
00:30:35,684 --> 00:30:38,651
It would be possible to transfer
the tracker using

437
00:30:38,652 --> 00:30:41,667
some kind of implement that would
extend a person's reach.

438
00:30:41,668 --> 00:30:44,680
Hmm. And was such an implement
found at the scene?

439
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,668
No. No.

440
00:30:55,656 --> 00:30:57,652
Right, is there anything else?

441
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,704
No. Thank you,
DI Denton, that will be all.

442
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,684
Well done, Kate.
You gave it your best shot.

443
00:31:22,652 --> 00:31:24,675
Nicking criminals is hard enough.

444
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:26,728
Nicking coppers -
God give me strength.

445
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:53,728
DS Arnott.

446
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,696
What? I'm on my way.

447
00:32:06,696 --> 00:32:09,699
Cheers, mate. Thanks for the call.
No problem.

448
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,739
Kate, let's go.

449
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,691
The bastard's changed the locks.
I bloody live here!

450
00:32:13,692 --> 00:32:15,643
Let's get you out of here, mate.

451
00:32:15,644 --> 00:32:17,643
The last thing
I need right now is you.

452
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,715
These two uniforms are doing you a
favour. So am I. I live here, Steve!

453
00:32:19,716 --> 00:32:21,660
Kate, move.

454
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:24,663
All right?

455
00:32:24,664 --> 00:32:25,745
I've got her, mate. Thanks.

456
00:32:28,716 --> 00:32:30,671
What's going on?

457
00:32:30,672 --> 00:32:32,651
I just wanted to see my son.

458
00:32:32,652 --> 00:32:34,647
You will.
Just not in the middle of the night.

459
00:32:34,648 --> 00:32:36,703
Well, I haven't got
anywhere else to go.

460
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,679
Where've you been staying?

461
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,696
Kate.

462
00:32:42,724 --> 00:32:44,707
I was undercover on Denton
and I blew it.

463
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:46,691
And now we're blowing
the whole case.

464
00:32:46,692 --> 00:32:48,699
I need to close this, Steve,
or I've got nothing.

465
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,679
Listen... You were shagging the
nurse and now you're shagging

466
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,687
the prime suspect. I'm not.
I saw you together.

467
00:32:53,688 --> 00:32:56,655
Your undercover failed because
we underestimated Lindsay.

468
00:32:56,656 --> 00:32:57,671
Mine's succeeding...

469
00:32:57,672 --> 00:33:00,699
because she underestimates me
just as much as you do.

470
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,704
What?

471
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,720
I think you're right about her.
OK? I think she done it.

472
00:33:12,676 --> 00:33:13,712
You OK?

473
00:33:15,688 --> 00:33:16,708
No.

474
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:24,664
Come here. All right. It's
all right. You'll be all right.

475
00:33:30,668 --> 00:33:31,688
Cheers, Steve.

476
00:33:32,716 --> 00:33:35,671
Well, we're definitely
missing something.

477
00:33:35,672 --> 00:33:38,695
The scene of the ambush has been
gone through every which way.

478
00:33:38,696 --> 00:33:41,664
There aren't any forensics that
incriminate Lindsay.

479
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:46,691
Look, let's scrap the ambush for
a bit, we need to go back further.

480
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:50,651
We know she was there at City Hall
on the night of the 16th.

481
00:33:50,652 --> 00:33:52,663
Let's assume Lindsay
did follow Dryden

482
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:54,667
and Carly to the
train station, right.

483
00:33:54,668 --> 00:33:57,671
There was limited CCTV coverage and
she's clever enough to avoid

484
00:33:57,672 --> 00:34:01,671
the camera, but she does witness
the sting on Dryden involving Carly.

485
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:04,643
I mean, she's always denied
a connection to Tommy.

486
00:34:04,644 --> 00:34:06,667
But this would be it,
20 days before the ambush.

487
00:34:06,668 --> 00:34:08,731
Carly's the connection.
If Lindsay was there,

488
00:34:08,732 --> 00:34:12,643
she would have known about Carly
much earlier than she claims.

489
00:34:12,644 --> 00:34:13,708
That would leave a trail.

490
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,703
Get dressed.

491
00:34:17,704 --> 00:34:19,656
You break a girl's heart.

492
00:34:34,684 --> 00:34:36,704
May we have a word, please, sir?

493
00:34:42,736 --> 00:34:45,684
DS Arnott, sir. DC Fleming.

494
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,739
You were here undercover. Yes, sir.

495
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,679
Still spying on us?

496
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,687
Sir, we've got
a few questions in regard to

497
00:34:53,688 --> 00:34:55,663
our investigation into DI Denton.

498
00:34:55,664 --> 00:34:57,683
I'd like my
Superintendents' Association rep here

499
00:34:57,684 --> 00:34:59,647
before I address your questions.

500
00:34:59,648 --> 00:35:01,735
It's your prerogative, sir,
if you want to go down that route.

501
00:35:01,736 --> 00:35:03,735
Or you can continue as a witness

502
00:35:03,736 --> 00:35:07,691
and AC-12 will note your cooperation
within your performance review.

503
00:35:07,692 --> 00:35:10,660
We hear you're applying
for the Executive Officers' course.

504
00:35:11,672 --> 00:35:14,659
Sir, with regard to DI Denton,
we know she was

505
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,704
interested in the disappearance
of Carly Kirk.

506
00:35:19,672 --> 00:35:23,647
It's one of the missing persons cases
placed on 28-day review

507
00:35:23,648 --> 00:35:24,969
and placed within Denton's brief.

508
00:35:26,652 --> 00:35:29,675
Did she ever show any interest
in the case before then, sir?

509
00:35:29,676 --> 00:35:32,679
No. No, she didn't.

510
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,735
As far as I know, it was only
when I put her on the 28s,

511
00:35:34,736 --> 00:35:36,683
after the ambush.

512
00:35:36,684 --> 00:35:37,727
Right.

513
00:35:37,728 --> 00:35:39,735
Who dealt with the case originally?

514
00:35:39,736 --> 00:35:42,680
Response officer was
Sergeant O'Neill.

515
00:35:49,668 --> 00:35:51,691
We were at 4th Street today.

516
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:53,643
Really?

517
00:35:53,644 --> 00:35:55,671
We're looking at the Duty Sergeant.

518
00:35:55,672 --> 00:35:57,696
O'Neill? Yeah.

519
00:35:59,692 --> 00:36:01,735
I checked his record.

520
00:36:01,736 --> 00:36:04,691
Seen you had a run-in with him
last year,

521
00:36:04,692 --> 00:36:07,707
got him disciplined for misuse
of his work computer.

522
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:10,700
Yeah. There was never
any love lost between us two.

523
00:36:11,732 --> 00:36:14,732
We know he took the call from Akers
the night of the ambush.

524
00:36:16,668 --> 00:36:20,719
Could he have been in on it,
let you take the blame?

525
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,675
I don't see how.
Do you want another drink?

526
00:36:23,676 --> 00:36:24,712
Yeah.

527
00:36:39,708 --> 00:36:41,735
What duties did you carry out
in connection with

528
00:36:41,736 --> 00:36:43,684
the disappearance of Carly Kirk?

529
00:36:45,688 --> 00:36:47,643
Uh...

530
00:36:47,644 --> 00:36:49,652
I was the initial response officer.

531
00:36:51,648 --> 00:36:54,647
As soon as we found out
about her disappearance,

532
00:36:54,648 --> 00:36:58,703
I organised the interview with her
foster parents, her mates.

533
00:36:58,704 --> 00:37:02,683
I organised the door-to-door,
but it were a dead end.

534
00:37:02,684 --> 00:37:04,719
She went on a 28-day
review after that

535
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,708
and I had nowt to do with the case.

536
00:37:08,672 --> 00:37:11,727
We've uncovered information that
Carly Kirk was involved in

537
00:37:11,728 --> 00:37:15,712
a blackmail conspiracy with a man
using the name of Alex Campbell.

538
00:37:17,664 --> 00:37:20,703
As part of our investigation,
we seized your work computer.

539
00:37:20,704 --> 00:37:23,695
On the hard drive we found evidence
of a police database search

540
00:37:23,696 --> 00:37:25,735
carried out on the 25th August
of this year

541
00:37:25,736 --> 00:37:28,731
in respect of the name
Alex Campbell.

542
00:37:28,732 --> 00:37:32,668
Sergeant, why were you gathering
information on Alex Campbell?

543
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,740
I wasn't, sir.

544
00:37:36,644 --> 00:37:37,672
You deny it?

545
00:37:38,676 --> 00:37:40,647
Yes, sir.

546
00:37:40,648 --> 00:37:42,735
Sergeant O'Neill has
a history of misconduct.

547
00:37:42,736 --> 00:37:45,683
A yellow notice for using
his work computer

548
00:37:45,684 --> 00:37:46,739
to access online gambling sites.

549
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,687
Yellow notice already.
Two strikes and you're out.

550
00:37:49,688 --> 00:37:51,731
No job, no pension.
On the night of the ambush,

551
00:37:51,732 --> 00:37:54,739
Sergeant O'Neill was the
Duty Sergeant at 4th Street Station.

552
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,711
You lost two good mates that night.

553
00:37:56,712 --> 00:37:59,676
Come on, why were you gathering
information on Alex Campbell?

554
00:38:01,672 --> 00:38:03,679
I've no need to tell you, Sergeant,

555
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,707
conspiracy to murder carries
a life sentence.

556
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:08,663
This will not be a red notice.

557
00:38:08,664 --> 00:38:10,712
I will go for
the full criminal prosecution.

558
00:38:15,664 --> 00:38:16,720
You need to start talking.

559
00:38:18,712 --> 00:38:20,660
Now.

560
00:38:30,652 --> 00:38:31,723
Hi, ma'am, how are you?

561
00:38:31,724 --> 00:38:33,671
Yeah, fine.

562
00:38:33,672 --> 00:38:35,719
Would you be prepared to
accompany me to a crime scene?

563
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,655
It may help us find Carly Kirk.

564
00:38:38,656 --> 00:38:40,708
Where? Edge Park Railway Station.

565
00:38:42,676 --> 00:38:43,712
Yeah. Absolutely.

566
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,675
When I worked with you,

567
00:39:02,676 --> 00:39:04,739
I saw first-hand how much
it meant to you finding Carly.

568
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,711
Just doing my job.

569
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:09,643
You don't have to put up
a front, ma'am.

570
00:39:09,644 --> 00:39:11,687
With missing persons,
sometimes you feel a connection.

571
00:39:11,688 --> 00:39:12,720
We're not machines.

572
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,655
Well, now we now know that
Carly might be alive,

573
00:39:17,656 --> 00:39:19,727
her visit here with Dryden may be
crucial to finding her.

574
00:39:19,728 --> 00:39:23,712
I'd like to find her,
just to know that she's OK.

575
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,660
I think you were here that evening.

576
00:39:30,684 --> 00:39:34,644
I think you can help us find her.
Who else was here?

577
00:39:35,644 --> 00:39:36,664
I wouldn't know.

578
00:39:37,696 --> 00:39:40,679
Alex Campbell, aka Tommy Hunter -
the protected witness.

579
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,691
I'm sorry, Kate,
but I can't help you.

580
00:39:42,692 --> 00:39:44,651
Carly's in terrible danger.

581
00:39:44,652 --> 00:39:46,712
God only knows what might be
happening to her.

582
00:39:48,696 --> 00:39:50,647
What happened here, Lindsay?

583
00:39:50,648 --> 00:39:52,648
I don't know because I wasn't here.

584
00:39:57,688 --> 00:40:00,668
Why don't you
just tell me the truth?

585
00:40:06,736 --> 00:40:09,672
I want to go home now.

586
00:40:43,704 --> 00:40:44,728
Thanks.

587
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:23,708
Hi. Hi.

588
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,683
I like your necklace.

589
00:41:28,684 --> 00:41:30,643
Sorry?

590
00:41:30,644 --> 00:41:32,707
Your necklace. It's really pretty.

591
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:35,719
Thanks. My mum gave it to me.

592
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,679
Lucky you.

593
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,663
I don't think it's anything special.
It's just a cheap one.

594
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:43,716
I meant that you have a mum that
gives you nice things.

595
00:42:26,652 --> 00:42:27,712
Get out.

596
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:49,723
What did you do?

597
00:42:49,724 --> 00:42:51,668
... off!

598
00:42:54,664 --> 00:42:56,719
Tom, let's just get her in the car.
Come on.

599
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,664
You wee tramp!

600
00:42:59,728 --> 00:43:02,648
Come here.
Come here to me. You idiot.

601
00:43:03,732 --> 00:43:07,703
You tramp! Come here, you. To me!

602
00:43:07,704 --> 00:43:09,664
Bring her to me!

603
00:44:10,668 --> 00:44:12,643
Been messing with my computer?

604
00:44:12,644 --> 00:44:14,648
You been up to your old habits?

605
00:44:15,648 --> 00:44:16,719
I should report you.

606
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,703
And have somebody trawling
through your hard drive?

607
00:44:19,704 --> 00:44:21,672
With your track record?

608
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:34,671
Alex Campbell?

609
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,711
I need to get to the chemist.

610
00:44:36,712 --> 00:44:40,672
DI Denton. This vehicle's
registered to Alex Campbell.

611
00:44:41,692 --> 00:44:44,667
My apologies.
How can I help you, Inspector?

612
00:44:44,668 --> 00:44:47,672
The vehicle's linked to a reported
assault on a girl.

613
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:52,740
Is there a problem here?

614
00:44:57,676 --> 00:45:01,648
No. No problem.
Think I must have the wrong person.

615
00:45:03,652 --> 00:45:05,672
You have a good day, Inspector.

616
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:36,704
Sorry to disturb you at home, ma'am.
Can I come in, please?

617
00:45:48,644 --> 00:45:50,655
What do you know
about Mr Campbell, ma'am?

618
00:45:50,656 --> 00:45:51,715
I'd rather not say.

619
00:45:51,716 --> 00:45:53,735
You left pretty sharpish.

620
00:45:53,736 --> 00:45:57,739
Maybe you weren't acting in a...
official capacity.

621
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:59,687
I shouldn't have got involved.

622
00:45:59,688 --> 00:46:01,655
You are involved, ma'am.

623
00:46:01,656 --> 00:46:02,695
Meaning?

624
00:46:02,696 --> 00:46:06,683
Meaning... that I was hoping
we could develop a common purpose.

625
00:46:06,684 --> 00:46:07,731
I don't think so.

626
00:46:07,732 --> 00:46:10,700
The girl. You know she's only 15?

627
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:16,695
Girls, drugs, guns.
He's been into the lot.

628
00:46:16,696 --> 00:46:19,687
And he still is,
and we can't touch him for it.

629
00:46:19,688 --> 00:46:21,651
Right.

630
00:46:21,652 --> 00:46:24,715
This girl. They've drugged her.
They've pimped her.

631
00:46:24,716 --> 00:46:26,667
They've beat her.

632
00:46:26,668 --> 00:46:29,680
There isn't anything they haven't
done to her, and won't keep doing.

633
00:46:32,688 --> 00:46:36,644
So let's start talking about
saving this girl's life.

634
00:46:37,704 --> 00:46:40,687
I'll arrest him. I'll bring him
into 4th Street Station.

635
00:46:40,688 --> 00:46:43,659
It's not going to happen.

636
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,651
He's got immunity. He's untouchable.

637
00:46:45,652 --> 00:46:47,672
He can't get away with this.
No, he can't.

638
00:46:49,684 --> 00:46:50,716
What are you suggesting?

639
00:46:52,696 --> 00:46:54,668
I don't know if I can trust you.

640
00:46:56,724 --> 00:46:59,671
If it comes to saving
the life of a 15-year-old girl,

641
00:46:59,672 --> 00:47:00,736
then yes, you can.

642
00:47:02,716 --> 00:47:04,696
It's got to be done right.

643
00:47:05,704 --> 00:47:08,680
He's smart.
He won't be taken in easily.

644
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:15,735
You'll get involved when you're
on call as Duty Inspector.

645
00:47:15,736 --> 00:47:19,675
No. There are other parties
interested in him.

646
00:47:19,676 --> 00:47:23,647
The less you know, the better,
for your own good.

647
00:47:23,648 --> 00:47:26,683
You'll get the information you need
about the girl.

648
00:47:26,684 --> 00:47:30,707
After that...
do you care what happens to him?

649
00:47:30,708 --> 00:47:32,732
Do you? Really?

650
00:47:37,684 --> 00:47:39,732
And obviously we can help you
in other ways.

651
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:43,932
Don't tell me you don't need it.

652
00:47:47,716 --> 00:47:49,655
No.

653
00:47:49,656 --> 00:47:51,720
We're already
involved in this together, Lindsay.

654
00:47:54,700 --> 00:48:00,695
There'll be a nice, calm, orderly
handover of the witness.

655
00:48:00,696 --> 00:48:03,707
No heroics. Definitely no guns.

656
00:48:03,708 --> 00:48:06,679
Everybody walks away.

657
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,684
Everybody wins.

658
00:48:10,664 --> 00:48:12,739
But before I leave here tonight...

659
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:16,736
I need the reassurance that you have
got as much to lose as I do.

660
00:48:19,704 --> 00:48:20,724
Take the money.

661
00:48:25,648 --> 00:48:26,680
Enjoy it.

662
00:48:46,664 --> 00:48:47,688
She's in.

663
00:48:48,696 --> 00:48:50,683
She want to know names?

664
00:48:50,684 --> 00:48:52,647
No.

665
00:48:52,648 --> 00:48:53,656
Good.

666
00:48:54,696 --> 00:48:56,668
Good for her.

667
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:07,676
'All that money getting me in here.'

668
00:49:08,704 --> 00:49:11,647
You've got your own life
to think of.

669
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:12,688
No. Mum, don't.

670
00:49:14,736 --> 00:49:17,659
My life's finished. Don't say that.

671
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:18,712
I have to say it.

672
00:49:20,676 --> 00:49:24,668
You've got to live yours,
before it passes you by.

673
00:49:56,732 --> 00:49:58,716
Fuck this.

674
00:50:02,704 --> 00:50:04,663
What's she playing at?

675
00:50:04,664 --> 00:50:06,688
What's happening? I don't know.

676
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,664
No!

677
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,708
Shit.

678
00:51:05,708 --> 00:51:07,648
Shit.

679
00:52:39,652 --> 00:52:40,704
Anything to say, ma'am?

680
00:52:49,652 --> 00:52:50,684
Hello, Inspector.

681
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:55,667
There were interesting findings on
Sergeant O'Neill's computer.

682
00:52:55,668 --> 00:52:57,711
You used it to get
information on Tommy Hunter,

683
00:52:57,712 --> 00:53:00,691
a full two weeks before the ambush.

684
00:53:00,692 --> 00:53:02,643
O'Neill's lying.

685
00:53:02,644 --> 00:53:04,707
He was the one that was
in on the conspiracy, not me.

686
00:53:04,708 --> 00:53:06,655
You told me he wasn't.

687
00:53:06,656 --> 00:53:08,727
In fact, you made a point
of directing me away from him

688
00:53:08,728 --> 00:53:11,736
as a line of inquiry -
to stop us checking his computer.

689
00:53:13,704 --> 00:53:15,688
Come upstairs, ma'am.

690
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:24,739
You also made a special point
of personally collecting

691
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,687
your mum's belongings.

692
00:53:26,688 --> 00:53:29,707
You even mentioned them straight
after you found out she was dead.

693
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:32,676
Strange it'd be the first thing
you'd think of.

694
00:53:33,704 --> 00:53:35,676
Open the overnight bag.

695
00:53:39,688 --> 00:53:41,648
Unzip the compartment.

696
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,727
Lindsay Denton, we're hereby
returning you to custody.

697
00:53:48,728 --> 00:53:51,684
Who are you two to judge me?

698
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:55,712
You don't know me.

699
00:54:06,732 --> 00:54:08,663
Well done, you two.

700
00:54:08,664 --> 00:54:10,679
Thanks, sir. Well done. Thanks, sir.

701
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,727
Yeah. Top job, the pair of you.
Cheers, Dot.

702
00:54:12,728 --> 00:54:16,703
Dot, your report on the Caddy -
that's coming along OK, yeah?

703
00:54:16,704 --> 00:54:20,647
Yes, it is, sir.
That Cole was a nasty piece of work.

704
00:54:20,648 --> 00:54:21,731
Wish I could finish the job.

705
00:54:21,732 --> 00:54:24,699
Still, I expect that'll go to
my replacement now, eh?

706
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:28,643
I've been meaning to say,
your secondment from AC-9,

707
00:54:28,644 --> 00:54:29,703
you fitted in really well.

708
00:54:29,704 --> 00:54:31,703
How would you like to make
that permanent?

709
00:54:31,704 --> 00:54:34,644
What can I say, sir? I'm your man.

710
00:54:35,688 --> 00:54:36,704
Good lad.

711
00:54:55,696 --> 00:54:57,663
Want another?

712
00:54:57,664 --> 00:54:58,676
Yeah, go on.

713
00:55:06,712 --> 00:55:09,695
It's fine.
We can do this another time.

714
00:55:09,696 --> 00:55:11,663
You going to go home?

715
00:55:11,664 --> 00:55:13,648
I'll sort something out.

716
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,704
You all right? Yeah.
Shall we get going?

717
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:28,700
Look...

718
00:55:29,704 --> 00:55:32,736
This is great.
Can we do it tomorrow night?

719
00:55:36,668 --> 00:55:37,680
Sure.

720
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:57,692
Excuse me.
Can we have the same again, please?

721
00:58:08,955 --> 00:58:41,042

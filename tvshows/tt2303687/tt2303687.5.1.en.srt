Help! My baby!

00:01:36,257 --> 00:01:38,276

29
00:01:38,277 --> 00:01:39,797

Back up, back up!

31
00:01:43,117 --> 00:01:44,754
Seven Five, stop.

32
00:01:44,755 --> 00:01:46,300

33
00:01:46,877 --> 00:01:48,476
Cover target vehicle.

00:01:48,477 --> 00:01:51,283
We're giving assistance
until locals attend then we'll TL.

35
00:01:51,284 --> 00:01:53,660
- Copy all, skip.

36
00:01:54,357 --> 00:01:56,876
I can't get her out!

37
00:01:56,877 --> 00:02:00,116
Control, Charlie Zulu Five Five,
request IR

38

39

00:02:05,557 --> 00:02:07,156
Please! Please!

41
00:02:07,157 --> 00:02:08,997
Please can you help my baby?!

42
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:26,356
One Five, please make towards Brown Lane.

43
00:02:26,357 --> 00:02:28,157
Re-report of RTC.

00:02:36,237 --> 00:02:39,107
Echo Delta Six Four, State Five

45
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:40,436
ETA two minutes.

46
00:02:40,437 --> 00:02:43,140
Two minutes! Take the lorry!

47
00:02:44,203 --> 00:02:46,683
No time for that soft lad. Let him go!

48
00:02:46,797 --> 00:02:48,356
Come on!

49
00:02:48,357 --> 00:02:50,117
Come on, let's go.

50
00:02:51,117 --> 00:02:52,996
We need to get the gear out of here!

51
00:02:52,997 --> 00:02:54,716
Move the lorry.

52
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:56,700
Let's move! Let's move!

53
00:03:00,437 --> 00:03:03,116
Control, Charlie Zulu Five Five,
are you receiving?

54
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:04,956
If she's alive, finish her!

55
00:03:07,197 --> 00:03:10,980
Can I slow
patrols down? Five Five, receiving?

56
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,516
She's a goner!

57
00:03:13,517 --> 00:03:15,436
Come on! Let's go!

58
00:03:15,437 --> 00:03:18,326
Control Charlie Zulu Five Five,
request sit rep?

59
00:03:24,227 --> 00:03:26,596
Control Charlie Zulu Five Five,

60
00:03:26,597 --> 00:03:28,916
Status Zero, Brown Lane,

61
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,596
ED-905 hijacked by armed suspects.

62
00:03:32,597 --> 00:03:36,156
All units, transport
ED-905 has been hijacked.

63
00:03:36,157 --> 00:03:38,356
Request units to Brown Lane
to assist with officers.

64
00:03:38,357 --> 00:03:41,260
State Zero and all units obs on.

65
00:03:48,317 --> 00:03:49,677
Give.

66
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:54,637
My favourite!

67
00:04:15,357 --> 00:04:17,100
Job done.

68
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,396
Nice work, lads.

69
00:04:19,397 --> 00:04:22,100
Now let's get this lot shifted.

70
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:41,476
Sir.

71
00:04:41,477 --> 00:04:42,916
What have we got?

72
00:04:42,917 --> 00:04:45,636
Hijack of a transport by
armed men wearing dark balaclavas.

73
00:04:45,637 --> 00:04:47,699
Three AFOs pronounced dead at the scene.

74
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,236
Fourth critically wounded.

75
00:04:49,237 --> 00:04:50,740
Mother of God.

76
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:54,276
The convoy was transporting
drugs from Eastfield Depot to the

77
00:04:54,277 --> 00:04:55,716
incineration facility.

78
00:04:55,717 --> 00:04:59,076
The firearms and balaclavas all fit
with the established OCG activity.

79
00:04:59,077 --> 00:05:00,676
As you were.

80
00:05:00,677 --> 00:05:03,476
The transport contained heroin
with a street value of ten million.

81
00:05:03,477 --> 00:05:06,669
Now the drugs themselves were
code number ED-905,

82
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,516
originally seized about 18 months ago.

83
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,956
So the chances are the OCG that
paid for it in the first place

84
00:05:10,957 --> 00:05:13,716
wanted it back, or maybe a rival OCG did.

85
00:05:13,717 --> 00:05:16,716
Either way, ED-905's back
in the hands of organised crime.

86
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:19,236
Yeah, well, one thing's for sure,
they certainly had access

87
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:20,468
to inside information. OK.

88
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:23,076
Steve, Kate,
consider yourselves assigned.

89
00:05:23,077 --> 00:05:24,248
Find that leak.

90
00:05:24,273 --> 00:05:25,356
- Sir.
- Sir.

91
00:05:25,357 --> 00:05:28,037
- Steve, are you OK to open a case number?
- Ma'am.

92
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:32,619
Maneet.

93
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,641
Sarge.

94
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,100
We need to open a case file
on the Eastfield hijack.

95
00:05:42,237 --> 00:05:43,637
Evening.

96
00:05:47,437 --> 00:05:48,597
Cheers.

97
00:05:53,757 --> 00:05:57,236
PS Cafferty, DI Fleming, AC-12.

98
00:05:57,237 --> 00:06:00,180
DS Arnott. We're sorry about what
happened to your team this morning.

99
00:06:00,677 --> 00:06:02,813
The doctor said you might be
up for answering some questions

100
00:06:02,814 --> 00:06:04,180
about the hijack.

101
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:06,636
No-one said AC-12 were on this.

102
00:06:06,637 --> 00:06:08,996
We've just opened our inquiry.

103
00:06:08,997 --> 00:06:12,156
We've listened to recordings
of your RT with Control.

104
00:06:12,157 --> 00:06:13,877
This is the transcript.

105
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,636
Now, initially you decided
to follow procedure

106
00:06:17,637 --> 00:06:20,461
and continue the convoy,
and then you changed your mind

107
00:06:20,462 --> 00:06:22,916
and attended the alleged
road traffic collision.

108
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:25,140
There's no "alleged", ma'am.

109
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,996
I saw a mother fighting to save her baby.

110
00:06:27,997 --> 00:06:30,484
I've got kids of my own.
What else was I going to do?

111
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,780
It must've been very distressing for you.

112
00:06:33,277 --> 00:06:35,516
There was immediate
threat to life, ma'am.

113
00:06:35,517 --> 00:06:38,276
I did my duty as a police officer.

114
00:06:38,277 --> 00:06:40,457
No-one's accusing you of anything, Jane.

115
00:06:40,482 --> 00:06:41,700
Yet.

116
00:06:42,077 --> 00:06:45,116
The OCG didn't look into a crystal ball.

117
00:06:45,117 --> 00:06:47,676
The hijack required inside information.

118
00:06:47,677 --> 00:06:50,497
Anyone spared immediately
becomes a person of interest.

119
00:06:50,498 --> 00:06:53,167
And I'm not telling you anything
you don't already know, Sarge.

120
00:06:53,168 --> 00:06:56,319
The lorry driver got away
without so much as a scratch.

121
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,836
We've learned he didn't get told
the itinerary till a few minutes

122
00:06:58,837 --> 00:07:02,138
before you all set off, and there's
no activity on his phone.

123
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:04,956
I never said a word to anyone outside

124
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,540
the chain of command about ED-905.

125
00:07:08,437 --> 00:07:10,460
I was lucky, that's all.

126
00:07:10,917 --> 00:07:13,356
You were the only female officer.

127
00:07:13,357 --> 00:07:15,556
- So?
- The only parent.

128
00:07:15,557 --> 00:07:16,996
Yeah.

129
00:07:16,997 --> 00:07:18,956
It wasn't just knowing the itinerary.

130
00:07:18,957 --> 00:07:21,660
The hijackers needed the convoy to stop.

131
00:07:22,517 --> 00:07:24,596
They were counting on
someone ordering your team

132
00:07:24,597 --> 00:07:27,276
back to the burning car
to rescue a child.

133
00:07:27,277 --> 00:07:31,380
Whoever was leaking information
to the OCG, they knew about you.

134
00:07:35,717 --> 00:07:37,116
What, is it?

135
00:07:37,117 --> 00:07:39,557
I haven't told you
the whole truth, ma'am.

136
00:07:42,757 --> 00:07:45,260
- Go on.
- I was spared.

137
00:07:46,557 --> 00:07:49,660
I didn't say, because
I knew you'd be suspicious.

138
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,637
The woman in the car,
the woman who set the trap...

139
00:07:55,277 --> 00:07:58,517
...maybe she didn't want to
leave my kids without a mum.

140
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,376
I don't know.

141
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,237
Whatever the reason, she told
the others that I was dead.

142
00:08:07,357 --> 00:08:09,180
She saved my life.

143
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,477
Can you describe this woman?

144
00:08:22,292 --> 00:08:26,196
The three officers were
PC Kevin Greysham, PC Ray Randhawa

145
00:08:26,197 --> 00:08:27,996
and PC Carl Waldhouse.

146
00:08:27,997 --> 00:08:31,836
All highly trained, authorised
firearms officers.

147
00:08:31,837 --> 00:08:35,596
Our thoughts are with their families
at this very difficult time.

148
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:38,704
The fourth officer, whose name
and location we're withholding

149
00:08:38,705 --> 00:08:42,220
for her own protection,
is expected to make a complete...

150
00:08:51,877 --> 00:08:53,343
I ended up in a lap-dancing bar.

151
00:08:53,368 --> 00:08:54,396
- Sparkles.
- Yeah.

152
00:08:54,397 --> 00:08:56,516
- I met this worldy.
- Oh, yeah.

153
00:08:56,517 --> 00:08:59,956
She had some bangers on her. Proper.

154
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:02,276
She's jumping up and down
and that and the room's shaking

155
00:09:02,277 --> 00:09:03,424
and everything, but they didn't move!

156
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:05,557
Sorry. John, you got a minute?

157
00:09:06,717 --> 00:09:08,157
Yeah, go ahead.

158
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,317
Lise.

159
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,517
I need to tell you something
so that it comes from me first.

160
00:09:21,877 --> 00:09:23,500
The fourth copper...

161
00:09:24,237 --> 00:09:25,837
...she survived.

162
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,740
But you said she was a goner.

163
00:09:30,117 --> 00:09:31,916
I'm not a doctor.

164
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:33,517
She can ID you.

165
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,290
I'll make it up.

166
00:09:39,816 --> 00:09:41,456
Tell me how.

167
00:09:52,637 --> 00:09:54,156
Not late am I, Sarge?

168
00:09:54,157 --> 00:09:55,396
I'm early.

169
00:09:55,397 --> 00:09:56,796
- Any leads yet?
- Sorry, Sarge.

170
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:59,076
We're looking at everyone
with knowledge of ED-905.

171
00:09:59,077 --> 00:10:00,316
Nothing yet.

172
00:10:00,317 --> 00:10:01,636
We'll keep working on it.

173
00:10:01,637 --> 00:10:02,997
All right. Cheers.

174
00:10:04,797 --> 00:10:07,316
All right, Maneet. How's the little 'un?

175
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:09,716
Oh, he's talking all the time now.

176
00:10:09,717 --> 00:10:11,557
- He never shuts up.
- Let's have a look.

177
00:10:12,757 --> 00:10:14,156
Aw! Bless him.

178
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:15,491
- What's wrong, baby?
- Mummy!

179
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:16,516
Yeah. Mummy's here.

180
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:17,700
- What? What?
- Ah, bless him.

181
00:10:17,725 --> 00:10:19,420
- No, Mummy!
- What?

182
00:10:20,357 --> 00:10:22,796
Your feet are so sticky!
I think it's bath time.

183
00:10:22,797 --> 00:10:26,598
Sarge, re the nominal,
I think I might've got something.

184
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:28,716
Oh, sorry, Maneet.

185
00:10:28,717 --> 00:10:30,796
A betting shop robbery three months ago.

186
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,996
Armed men wearing dark balaclavas.

187
00:10:32,997 --> 00:10:35,716
A female accomplice diverted
staff by claiming her baby had

188
00:10:35,717 --> 00:10:37,476
stopped breathing.

189
00:10:37,477 --> 00:10:39,500
The baby turned out to be a doll.

190
00:10:41,837 --> 00:10:44,316
- Is there a description of the nominal?
- CCTV?

191
00:10:44,317 --> 00:10:45,716
That's the thing, ma'am.

192
00:10:45,717 --> 00:10:48,196
The CCTV's been sequestered.

193
00:10:48,197 --> 00:10:50,796
I tried to access the
details and I was blocked.

194
00:10:50,797 --> 00:10:52,197
Blocked?

195
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,197
What's the case number?

196
00:11:10,717 --> 00:11:12,357
Thanks, Tatleen.

197
00:11:28,477 --> 00:11:29,796
You all right?

198
00:11:29,797 --> 00:11:31,436
All right.

199
00:11:31,437 --> 00:11:35,436
There was a code associated with
the MOPI Notice, C-1601.

200
00:11:35,437 --> 00:11:39,093
C-1601 blocks access to
aspects of a number of cases

201
00:11:39,094 --> 00:11:41,836
and one name kept coming up
as the authorising officer.

202
00:11:41,837 --> 00:11:43,996
Detective Superintendent Alison Powell.

203
00:11:43,997 --> 00:11:46,276
- Never heard of her.
- No. Me neither.

204
00:11:46,277 --> 00:11:47,916
What is this place?

205
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:49,477
I thought you might know.

206
00:11:56,997 --> 00:11:59,516
DI Fleming, DS Arnott, AC-12.

207
00:11:59,517 --> 00:12:01,757
We've got an appointment with DSU Powell.

208
00:12:04,677 --> 00:12:05,997
They're here.

209
00:12:09,517 --> 00:12:11,060
Alison Powell.

210
00:12:22,317 --> 00:12:23,796
Sir?

211
00:12:23,797 --> 00:12:25,860
- Sir?
- Kate, Steve.

212
00:12:27,517 --> 00:12:31,196
Management of Police Information
exists for a reason.

213
00:12:31,197 --> 00:12:33,116
When you encountered the MOPI Notice,

214
00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:36,716
you set off an electronic tripwire.
I was prepared to overlook that.

215
00:12:36,717 --> 00:12:39,116
And then when your office
requested a meeting, I thought

216
00:12:39,117 --> 00:12:41,516
it best to consult
with Superintendent Hastings.

217
00:12:41,517 --> 00:12:43,676
They are my best team.

218
00:12:43,677 --> 00:12:45,596
They'll get to the root of anything.

219
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:47,036
The root being what, sir?

220
00:12:47,037 --> 00:12:49,556
Access to certain case
files has been restricted due

221
00:12:49,557 --> 00:12:50,996
to their sensitivity.

222
00:12:50,997 --> 00:12:53,196
I'm not at liberty
to disclose the details,

223
00:12:53,197 --> 00:12:54,996
not even to Superintendent Hastings.

224
00:12:54,997 --> 00:12:58,940
He's here to assure you that there
is nothing unlawful going on.

225
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:04,916
AC-12 have stumbled on an extremely
sensitive undercover operation.

226
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:09,036
Is there a UCO embedded in the OCG
that carried out the heroin hijack?

227
00:13:09,037 --> 00:13:11,396
As a former UCO yourself,
DI Fleming, you know

228
00:13:11,397 --> 00:13:12,876
I can't confirm or deny.

229
00:13:12,877 --> 00:13:14,236
I'm a bit baffled here

230
00:13:14,237 --> 00:13:17,876
because I've no idea what
this place is or what you do.

231
00:13:17,877 --> 00:13:20,876
I've been brought in from an
outside force to lead on

232
00:13:20,877 --> 00:13:23,516
a specific operation,
authorised at the highest level,

233
00:13:23,517 --> 00:13:26,197
and we've done a good
job of keeping it hidden.

234
00:13:26,463 --> 00:13:27,863
Till now.

235
00:13:28,837 --> 00:13:32,636
Three police officers
were killed in that hijack.

236
00:13:32,637 --> 00:13:36,396
I can assure you our UCO has not
been authorised to encourage,

237
00:13:36,397 --> 00:13:38,556
enable or commit criminal offences.

238
00:13:38,557 --> 00:13:41,316
Nonetheless, you might
want to extract your officer

239
00:13:41,317 --> 00:13:43,836
and submit some evidence
against the murderers.

240
00:13:43,837 --> 00:13:47,196
Our operation's at a critical stage.

241
00:13:47,197 --> 00:13:49,476
Best served by leaving
our asset in place.

242
00:13:49,477 --> 00:13:52,276
Ma'am, did your UCO provide
intelligence that facilitated

243
00:13:52,277 --> 00:13:54,860
arrests following
the betting shop robbery?

244
00:13:56,117 --> 00:14:00,420
As I said, AC-12 have
stumbled on an undercover operation.

245
00:14:03,477 --> 00:14:05,557
And now I need you all to stumble away.

246
00:14:17,877 --> 00:14:19,317
Ted.

247
00:14:24,477 --> 00:14:25,957
Alison.

248
00:14:43,277 --> 00:14:45,716
What the hell are you playing at,
not keeping me informed?

249
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:48,476
Sir, it's my job as DI
to take on responsibility.

250
00:14:48,477 --> 00:14:51,387
I wanted to know we were definitely
onto something before I came

251
00:14:51,412 --> 00:14:52,660
knocking at your door.

252
00:14:53,117 --> 00:14:57,036
Sir, an undercover officer involved
in the hijack had a duty to warn

253
00:14:57,037 --> 00:14:59,356
their Covert Ops Manager
officers were in danger.

254
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,636
Same goes for identifying
the betting-shop robber.

255
00:15:01,637 --> 00:15:04,154
Maybe she couldn't make contact
without breaking cover.

256
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:05,253
She?

257
00:15:05,254 --> 00:15:08,076
You think the UCO's the nominal,
the one that saved Cafferty's life?

258
00:15:08,077 --> 00:15:10,468
Makes sense, sir.
She couldn't stop the hijack

259
00:15:10,469 --> 00:15:12,396
but the best she could do
was limit the loss of life.

260
00:15:12,397 --> 00:15:15,156
Oh, Christ. I've been there.
The lies, the fear.

261
00:15:15,157 --> 00:15:17,237
God only knows what she's going through.

262
00:15:34,877 --> 00:15:37,676
Sorry, Lise, we're loading up.

263
00:15:37,677 --> 00:15:39,237
I'll be right out.

264
00:15:50,877 --> 00:15:53,877
Right. Don't move, lights off,
keep the engine running.

265
00:16:14,797 --> 00:16:16,197
Just do it.

266
00:16:21,117 --> 00:16:23,277
You made his night there, Lise.

267
00:16:27,957 --> 00:16:29,476
Be right with you.

268
00:16:29,477 --> 00:16:31,636
You're all right, Slater.

269
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:34,500
You take your time.
Shake off all the drips.

270
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:45,756
You the guys?

271
00:16:45,757 --> 00:16:48,620
Yeah. Yeah, we're the guys.

272
00:16:52,117 --> 00:16:53,700
This your bird?

273
00:16:54,237 --> 00:16:55,700
Bit personal.

274
00:16:56,536 --> 00:16:58,296
Is he yours?

275
00:17:00,117 --> 00:17:03,460
Now the pissing contest's over
with maybe we can talk business.

276
00:17:04,277 --> 00:17:06,100
No business to talk.

277
00:17:06,517 --> 00:17:08,236
You got our merchandise.

278
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:11,076
Ours, bought and paid for.

279
00:17:11,077 --> 00:17:15,636
Except you lost it and we ventured
some resources into recovering it.

280
00:17:15,637 --> 00:17:17,276
You want a finder's fee.

281
00:17:17,277 --> 00:17:19,356
Call it what you want, mate.

282
00:17:19,357 --> 00:17:20,980
I'd call it half.

283
00:17:22,516 --> 00:17:24,116
What you got is ours.

284
00:17:25,397 --> 00:17:28,836
The filth seizing it way back
when don't make no difference.

285
00:17:28,837 --> 00:17:32,260
Are you going to try putting
it on the street? Our gear?

286
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:36,236
That's why we should make a deal.

287
00:17:36,237 --> 00:17:39,100
Avoid any conflict of ownership.

288
00:17:40,397 --> 00:17:42,340
I got no problem with conflicts.

289
00:17:42,997 --> 00:17:44,477
Me neither.

290
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,037
Three dead coppers tell you that.

291
00:17:52,317 --> 00:17:55,397
Fight over the merchandise, we both lose.

292
00:17:55,696 --> 00:17:57,136
Make a deal...

293
00:17:58,309 --> 00:17:59,589
...we both win.

294
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:03,049
She your bird or what?

295
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,916
This is a professional meeting.

296
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:09,237
I'm here in a professional capacity.

297
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:12,116
Look at him, not me.

298
00:18:12,117 --> 00:18:15,020
- He's talking sense.
- 50-50.

299
00:18:16,317 --> 00:18:18,356
Half the merchandise

300
00:18:18,357 --> 00:18:20,796
or half the street value.

301
00:18:20,797 --> 00:18:22,837
Makes no difference to us.

302
00:18:24,357 --> 00:18:25,677
50-50 ain't going to happen.

303
00:18:27,997 --> 00:18:29,596
10%.

304
00:18:29,597 --> 00:18:32,860
No, we're facing life for
murdering three coppers, Slater.

305
00:18:35,357 --> 00:18:37,436
That ain't 10%.

306
00:18:37,437 --> 00:18:41,917
We both know you can shift that gear
for ten times what you paid for it.

307
00:18:42,169 --> 00:18:43,649
The numbers work.

308
00:18:44,837 --> 00:18:46,637
Everyone wins.

309
00:18:56,957 --> 00:18:58,581
- Cheers, lad.
- Ta.

310
00:18:58,582 --> 00:19:00,716
I thought we'd lost you for the night.

311
00:19:00,717 --> 00:19:03,396
Just needed a minute
in private, that's all.

312
00:19:03,397 --> 00:19:04,957
Here you are.

313
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:07,796
Not in the mood, mate.

314
00:19:07,797 --> 00:19:09,476
Come on, Lise.

315
00:19:09,477 --> 00:19:11,356
Don't be stupid. Have a little bump.

316
00:19:11,357 --> 00:19:13,396
Celebrations are a bit
premature, aren't they?

317
00:19:13,397 --> 00:19:14,916
I'll be fine.

318
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:17,207
We can't trust them, John.
We don't know them.

319
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,819
Look. You don't need to know
someone to play a game.

320
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,905
There's no point talking to
you when you're off your face.

321
00:19:21,906 --> 00:19:23,824
We're getting into business
with bad people.

322
00:19:23,825 --> 00:19:25,637
We're bad people!

323
00:19:28,157 --> 00:19:29,916
Whoa! Look at this.

324
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:31,116
Now, here we go.

325
00:19:31,117 --> 00:19:33,276
Now the celebrations can really begin!

326
00:19:33,277 --> 00:19:35,357
A pair of crackers! Look at them.

327
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,116
I'll have the two of you.

328
00:19:38,117 --> 00:19:39,636
- Oi, oi!
- Chill out.

329
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,276
What about me?

330
00:19:41,277 --> 00:19:42,997
Get your own.

331
00:20:00,537 --> 00:20:02,377
Sorry, Sarge, have you got a minute?

332
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,150
Yeah.

333
00:20:13,557 --> 00:20:15,180
We've been checking out
officers that were aware

334
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:16,996
of transport ED-905.

335
00:20:16,997 --> 00:20:19,436
As per instructions, I've been
searching for officers with

336
00:20:19,437 --> 00:20:21,556
any kind of disciplinary record.

337
00:20:21,557 --> 00:20:23,636
Vihaan Malhotra.

338
00:20:23,637 --> 00:20:25,836
Civilian Administrator.

339
00:20:25,837 --> 00:20:28,436
He's one of the staff involved
in organising the processing

340
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:30,956
and disposal of controlled substances.

341
00:20:30,957 --> 00:20:33,316
Repeated minor disciplinary offences,

342
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:36,636
mainly for poor time keeping
and irregularities with expenses.

343
00:20:36,637 --> 00:20:38,076
So, what's the problem?

344
00:20:38,077 --> 00:20:40,140
His name came up early on.

345
00:20:41,237 --> 00:20:42,716
I showed the file to Maneet.

346
00:20:42,717 --> 00:20:45,716
I'm not sure why she didn't
think it was worth investigating.

347
00:20:45,717 --> 00:20:47,637
She knows what she's doing.

348
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:49,449
Sorry.

349
00:20:49,747 --> 00:20:50,980
You're right.

350
00:21:08,877 --> 00:21:10,460
Sit down, Vihaan.

351
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:13,436
DS Arnott, DI Fleming.

352
00:21:13,437 --> 00:21:15,556
Like to ask you some
questions about the hijack

353
00:21:15,557 --> 00:21:18,596
of seized goods transport ED-905.

354
00:21:18,597 --> 00:21:20,196
Sure, yeah.

355
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:22,356
Your job here is to
sign off on Seized Goods

356
00:21:22,357 --> 00:21:24,436
when they're no longer
required in evidence.

357
00:21:24,437 --> 00:21:26,556
Our inquiries show you
were responsible for some

358
00:21:26,557 --> 00:21:28,388
- of the paperwork on ED-905.
- Not just that one.

359
00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:30,037
I'm across lots of...

360
00:21:32,717 --> 00:21:34,700
You seem nervous, Vihaan.

361
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:37,389
Why are you nervous?

362
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:39,996
Has someone been talking about me?

363
00:21:39,997 --> 00:21:43,397
We did some basic background
checks on you, Vihaan, that's all.

364
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,837
Anything you want to confide?

365
00:21:50,117 --> 00:21:51,757
No.

366
00:21:57,856 --> 00:21:59,256
Vihaan?

367
00:22:05,689 --> 00:22:07,329
I...

368
00:22:10,477 --> 00:22:12,197
I need a glass of water.

369
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:30,069
Down! Stay down! Down!

370
00:22:30,094 --> 00:22:32,494
Down! Stay down!

371
00:22:32,677 --> 00:22:35,534
Vihaan Malhotra, you're under arrest
for conspiracy to commit robbery.

372
00:22:35,535 --> 00:22:37,507
You do not have to say anything
but it may harm your defence

373
00:22:37,508 --> 00:22:38,627
if you do not mention, when questioned,

374
00:22:38,628 --> 00:22:39,800
something you later rely on in court.

375
00:22:39,801 --> 00:22:42,260
Anything you do say
may be used in evidence.

376
00:22:43,397 --> 00:22:45,156
Steve, are you all right?

377
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:46,887
Steve? You all right?

378
00:22:46,888 --> 00:22:48,727
Yeah, yeah.

379
00:22:48,728 --> 00:22:50,236
Do you need your back looking at?

380
00:22:50,237 --> 00:22:52,076
- Are you sure?
- I'm fine.

381
00:22:52,077 --> 00:22:53,797
Come on, up. Move!

382
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:05,996
- Hiya!
- Hey.

383
00:23:05,997 --> 00:23:07,556
Look who's back. How are you doing?

384
00:23:07,557 --> 00:23:09,276
Oh, something smells good!

385
00:23:09,277 --> 00:23:10,740
Proper treat.

386
00:23:11,597 --> 00:23:13,477
You all right?

387
00:23:45,837 --> 00:23:49,076
- Good to go, boss?
- Yeah, let's do this.

388
00:23:49,077 --> 00:23:50,756
Tatleen, is Maneet around?

389
00:23:50,757 --> 00:23:53,279
No, ma'am, called in sick today.
Stomach bug.

390
00:23:53,304 --> 00:23:54,540
OK, thanks.

391
00:24:01,317 --> 00:24:03,196
Document nine in your folders.

392
00:24:03,197 --> 00:24:05,516
Document nine shows calls
made from an unregistered

393
00:24:05,517 --> 00:24:08,276
pay-as-you-go phone,
a so-called burner phone,

394
00:24:08,277 --> 00:24:09,876
to contact other burner phones.

395
00:24:09,877 --> 00:24:12,596
Location triangulation
places your phone near your

396
00:24:12,597 --> 00:24:14,396
home address at the time of the calls.

397
00:24:14,397 --> 00:24:16,636
One of the phones you
were contacting has been

398
00:24:16,637 --> 00:24:21,276
retrospectively placed at the
hijack of transport ED-905.

399
00:24:21,277 --> 00:24:23,340
Did you make this call, Mr Malhotra?

400
00:24:26,437 --> 00:24:27,579
No comment.

401
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,676
At your home, our search
team made a discovery

402
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:33,676
under your floorboards, submitted
in evidence as item JLM-5.

403
00:24:33,677 --> 00:24:36,340
JLM-5 can be viewed in image 11...

404
00:24:40,677 --> 00:24:42,500
...and image 12.

405
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:46,636
Used banknotes in the sum of £25,000.

406
00:24:46,637 --> 00:24:49,300
How do you account for
this finding, Mr Malhotra?

407
00:24:51,048 --> 00:24:52,920
- No comment.
- Mr Malhotra,

408
00:24:52,945 --> 00:24:55,435
have you been receiving bribes
from an organised crime group

409
00:24:55,436 --> 00:24:58,074
as an inducement to disclose
sensitive information regarding

410
00:24:58,075 --> 00:25:02,797
police operations, specifically
with respect to transport ED-905?

411
00:25:03,209 --> 00:25:04,889
No comment.

412
00:25:06,157 --> 00:25:08,396
OK, Mr Malhotra, whichever
way you want to play this,

413
00:25:08,397 --> 00:25:10,556
it makes no odds to me.

414
00:25:10,557 --> 00:25:13,196
I've consulted with the
Crown Prosecutor in respect

415
00:25:13,197 --> 00:25:17,276
of conspiracy to commit robbery
and malfeasance in a public office.

416
00:25:17,277 --> 00:25:19,996
And I'm satisfied she'll
agree that the threshold has been

417
00:25:19,997 --> 00:25:22,197
reached to charge you
with these offences.

418
00:25:23,437 --> 00:25:26,436
Also, given the loss of life,
I will be seeking authority to

419
00:25:26,437 --> 00:25:28,820
charge you with conspiracy to murder.

420
00:25:29,077 --> 00:25:31,916
And as you may know,
if convicted, conspiracy to murder

421
00:25:31,917 --> 00:25:34,220
carries a life sentence.

422
00:25:37,723 --> 00:25:39,323
No. No, wait.

423
00:25:39,348 --> 00:25:40,940
Come on, Vihaan.

424
00:25:41,877 --> 00:25:43,636
They never said people'd get killed.

425
00:25:43,637 --> 00:25:46,220
- Who did?
- Who contacted you, Vihaan?

426
00:25:46,877 --> 00:25:48,956
They said her was from
the betting company.

427
00:25:48,957 --> 00:25:50,500
A woman?

428
00:25:50,797 --> 00:25:54,556
Her said they had
a policy of offering people

429
00:25:54,557 --> 00:25:58,780
with big debts
a structured repayment programme.

430
00:25:59,117 --> 00:26:02,116
Her took details off me, everything.

431
00:26:02,117 --> 00:26:03,876
Her used the personal information

432
00:26:03,877 --> 00:26:06,796
I'd given her to find out
all about my private life

433
00:26:06,797 --> 00:26:09,555
and, if I don't do what her say,
her tell my whole family.

434
00:26:09,556 --> 00:26:11,340
Can you describe this woman, Vihaan?

435
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,717
Young.

436
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,740
Dark hair, mixed race.

437
00:26:19,837 --> 00:26:21,517
Pausing interview.

438
00:26:29,117 --> 00:26:31,997
The UCO recruited him
and then she never told anyone.

439
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,236
Maybe she had to find
an informant as part of

440
00:26:34,237 --> 00:26:35,956
ingratiating herself into the OCG.

441
00:26:35,957 --> 00:26:38,196
Giving up Malhotra
risked blowing her cover.

442
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:39,796
If she'd reported Malhotra,

443
00:26:39,797 --> 00:26:41,956
three coppers wouldn't be
in the morgue right now.

444
00:26:41,957 --> 00:26:44,436
No, this UCO, she's crossed the line.

445
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,396
Powell stonewalled us.

446
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:48,597
Let's see if Malhotra's more forthcoming.

447
00:26:49,917 --> 00:26:51,357
Resuming interview.

448
00:26:54,397 --> 00:26:56,996
Right. This woman,
how many times did you meet her?

449
00:26:56,997 --> 00:26:59,767
Just a couple of times,
first when her pretended

450
00:26:59,768 --> 00:27:03,476
to be from the betting company
and then when her blackmailed me.

451
00:27:03,477 --> 00:27:06,636
So, after that, how did you
maintain contact with this woman?

452
00:27:06,637 --> 00:27:08,156
No way.

453
00:27:08,157 --> 00:27:10,676
Any leads you can give us
tracing this woman, Vihaan,

454
00:27:10,677 --> 00:27:13,700
that would allow us to show the
court you've assisted our inquiry.

455
00:27:14,637 --> 00:27:16,357
Shorten my sentence, yeah?

456
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:21,436
More like shorten my life expectancy.

457
00:27:21,437 --> 00:27:23,675
Vihaan, this is an urgent
investigation seeking

458
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:25,158
hardened criminals.

459
00:27:25,183 --> 00:27:27,516
Three police officers
murdered in cold blood.

460
00:27:27,517 --> 00:27:29,996
We need to find these criminals
and put them behind bars.

461
00:27:29,997 --> 00:27:32,073
If you know names and you
aren't giving them to us,

462
00:27:32,074 --> 00:27:34,055
this is only going to
get worse for you, Vihaan.

463
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,622
We're throwing you a lifeline here, mate.

464
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:39,956
I know what you're up to.

465
00:27:39,957 --> 00:27:41,716
Don't act like I don't.

466
00:27:41,717 --> 00:27:43,116
What are we up to, Vihaan?

467
00:27:43,117 --> 00:27:45,396
Protecting one of your own.

468
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:47,796
Her's the one pointed the finger at me

469
00:27:47,797 --> 00:27:50,276
and everyone's acting
like her never done nothing.

470
00:27:50,277 --> 00:27:52,596
We really don't know what
you're talking about, Vihaan.

471
00:27:52,597 --> 00:27:54,020
Bollocks.

472
00:27:54,517 --> 00:27:56,497
Her's as much to blame as me.

473
00:27:56,498 --> 00:27:58,700
Who? Who's as much to blame?

474
00:28:18,477 --> 00:28:20,957
We're good to go with Slater for a trade.

475
00:28:22,837 --> 00:28:24,780
- When?
- Tonight.

476
00:28:25,597 --> 00:28:26,956
Nice one.

477
00:28:26,957 --> 00:28:28,380
Is it?

478
00:28:29,826 --> 00:28:31,218
What do you mean?

479
00:28:31,219 --> 00:28:32,860
I look at you.

480
00:28:33,237 --> 00:28:37,836
There's a little voice telling me,
"She's soft. She's a bottler.

481
00:28:37,837 --> 00:28:39,557
"She'll drag us all down."

482
00:28:40,717 --> 00:28:43,260
- That's bollocks, John.
- Well, prove it.

483
00:28:44,136 --> 00:28:46,256
I want to put Slater out of business.

484
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:50,196
Show me you're still worth some value.

485
00:28:50,197 --> 00:28:53,637
Or that little voice is
going to start telling me that

486
00:28:53,996 --> 00:28:56,436
I've gave you enough second chances.

487
00:29:16,317 --> 00:29:19,117
Right, it's all yours. I won't be far.

488
00:29:33,456 --> 00:29:35,216
Where's your boss?

489
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:38,069
Tonight, I'm the boss.

490
00:29:40,876 --> 00:29:42,636
Bullshit.

491
00:29:43,797 --> 00:29:46,036
At most, you take care of the livestock.

492
00:29:46,037 --> 00:29:48,597
We're not selling livestock,
we're selling gear.

493
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:51,940
Half the street value.

494
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:54,236
Here's proof of our end.

495
00:29:54,237 --> 00:29:56,157
The rest's in the van outside.

496
00:30:06,357 --> 00:30:08,437
Half was what I agreed with your boss.

497
00:30:12,157 --> 00:30:13,540
Me and you...

498
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,620
...we need to make a new deal.

499
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,543
25%.

500
00:30:29,469 --> 00:30:31,709
25%.

501
00:30:37,017 --> 00:30:38,737
That works.

502
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,210
What's in the van's all yours.

503
00:30:43,397 --> 00:30:45,477
But what's in the van's half the gear.

504
00:30:46,717 --> 00:30:50,156
My boss delivers the rest
once you stump up the other 25%.

505
00:30:50,157 --> 00:30:53,980
Or we could just piss around
all night playing games, Slater.

506
00:30:56,103 --> 00:30:57,820
You seem to like that.

507
00:31:06,517 --> 00:31:10,036
Hey. We're minted!

508
00:31:10,037 --> 00:31:12,476
- Lise!
- Never in doubt, eh.

509
00:31:12,477 --> 00:31:14,756
One last thing before we're even.

510
00:31:14,757 --> 00:31:16,836
Mark Malhotra's card.

511
00:31:16,837 --> 00:31:19,436
Make sure he's 100%
acquainted with the consequences

512
00:31:19,437 --> 00:31:21,357
if he talks about the hijack.

513
00:31:23,517 --> 00:31:25,660
He's already shitting bricks, John.

514
00:31:27,077 --> 00:31:29,677
Now let's not go falling
out again, eh, Lise?

515
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:33,997
Cheers.

516
00:31:46,157 --> 00:31:47,796
PC Paul Harris and PC Bindra.

517
00:31:47,797 --> 00:31:49,436
Could you just sign in, please?

518
00:31:49,437 --> 00:31:50,796
I can't bear this.

519
00:31:50,797 --> 00:31:52,317
Me neither.

520
00:32:00,197 --> 00:32:01,757
Get set up.

521
00:32:03,517 --> 00:32:05,037
Sir. Sir.

522
00:32:27,837 --> 00:32:30,876
AC-12 interview of Police Constable
Maneet Bindra, in the presence

523
00:32:30,877 --> 00:32:32,516
of her Police Federation rep,

524
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:35,780
by Superintendent Hastings,
DI Fleming, DS Arnott.

525
00:32:37,117 --> 00:32:39,053
PC Bindra, you do not
have to say anything

526
00:32:39,054 --> 00:32:40,852
but it may harm your defence
if you do not mention

527
00:32:40,853 --> 00:32:43,394
when questioned something
you later rely on in court.

528
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:45,528
Anything you do say
may be used in evidence.

529
00:32:46,363 --> 00:32:47,963
Document eight.

530
00:32:49,557 --> 00:32:52,076
Document eight is a statement
by a member of civilian staff,

531
00:32:52,077 --> 00:32:54,676
Vihaan Malhotra, confessing to disclosing

532
00:32:54,677 --> 00:32:56,996
confidential information
about police operations

533
00:32:56,997 --> 00:32:59,157
to an organised crime group.

534
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,930
What is your relationship
with Vihaan Malhotra?

535
00:33:04,076 --> 00:33:05,596
He's my cousin, ma'am.

536
00:33:06,957 --> 00:33:10,276
Did you deliberately suppress a lead
that would have led us to Malhotra?

537
00:33:10,277 --> 00:33:15,500
A person instrumental in the
hijacking of dangerous narcotics.

538
00:33:19,317 --> 00:33:20,540
I'm sorry.

539
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:23,100
So you were aware of Malhotra's offences?

540
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:27,620
PC Bindra?

541
00:33:28,037 --> 00:33:33,312
No, sir, I wasn't aware Vihaan
was passing information to an OCG.

542
00:33:33,313 --> 00:33:37,796
Information that put
three officers in the morgue

543
00:33:37,797 --> 00:33:40,180
and one but for the grace of God!

544
00:33:45,196 --> 00:33:46,836
Document two in your folders.

545
00:33:48,117 --> 00:33:50,676
Document two is a summary of
an internal investigation

546
00:33:50,677 --> 00:33:52,876
into information leakage
that occurred following

547
00:33:52,877 --> 00:33:56,636
the disciplinary proceedings
against DC Jamie Desford.

548
00:33:56,637 --> 00:34:01,796
On screen, video one, an AV
recording of PC Bindra's statement

549
00:34:01,797 --> 00:34:03,860
in respect of the foregoing.

550
00:34:04,197 --> 00:34:06,716
Desford's already
been served a red notice

551
00:34:06,717 --> 00:34:08,556
for his activities in collusion

552
00:34:08,557 --> 00:34:10,956
with Assistant Chief
Constable Derek Hilton.

553
00:34:10,957 --> 00:34:14,525
Yet Desford denies
disclosing sensitive AC-12 files

554
00:34:14,526 --> 00:34:15,956
to Hilton.

555
00:34:15,957 --> 00:34:18,836
Desford claims to have been
deceived in disclosing his username

556
00:34:18,837 --> 00:34:21,076
and password by you.

557
00:34:21,077 --> 00:34:23,320
You've got no evidence
to put her fingers on that keyboard.

558
00:34:23,321 --> 00:34:26,583
Look. Let's stop beating
about the bush, PC Bindra.

559
00:34:26,584 --> 00:34:29,733
Did you use Desford's log-in information

560
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:33,059
to download confidential files,
which you then passed on

561
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,260
to Assistant Chief Constable Hilton?

562
00:34:36,557 --> 00:34:37,956
Yes, or no?

563
00:34:37,957 --> 00:34:39,900
No, sir, absolutely not.

564
00:34:45,037 --> 00:34:46,557
You work with someone...

565
00:34:48,996 --> 00:34:50,516
...you take them at their word.

566
00:34:52,036 --> 00:34:53,756
More fool me.

567
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,740
Continuing with document eight.

568
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:04,188
Vihaan Malhotra alleges you
supplied confidential AC-12 files

569
00:35:04,189 --> 00:35:07,476
to Assistant Chief Constable Hilton
in return for Hilton's silence

570
00:35:07,477 --> 00:35:09,957
regarding Malhotra's offences.

571
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,636
No.

572
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,630
No?

573
00:35:16,037 --> 00:35:18,681
I never knew it was so bad,
what Vihaan was doing,

574
00:35:18,682 --> 00:35:20,596
otherwise I'd never have
gone along with it.

575
00:35:20,597 --> 00:35:21,997
Along with what?

576
00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:27,076
It's true ACC Hilton
used Vihaan to blackmail me.

577
00:35:27,077 --> 00:35:29,116
Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

578
00:35:29,117 --> 00:35:32,636
You've got to believe me, sir,
when I tell you Hilton never said

579
00:35:32,637 --> 00:35:36,396
anything about Vihaan
leaking information to an OCG.

580
00:35:36,397 --> 00:35:37,676
He only told me

581
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:40,876
Vihaan was in danger of dismissal
over his personal problems.

582
00:35:40,877 --> 00:35:45,076
I wanted Vihaan to have a chance
of kicking his gambling addiction.

583
00:35:45,077 --> 00:35:48,596
Hilton said that
he'd pull strings for Vihaan

584
00:35:48,597 --> 00:35:51,716
if I agreed to keep him
in the loop on AC-12 operations.

585
00:35:51,717 --> 00:35:53,636
You were spying on us!

586
00:35:53,637 --> 00:35:55,836
Sir, he was the ACC.

587
00:35:55,837 --> 00:35:58,060
I honestly believed it was lawful.

588
00:35:59,597 --> 00:36:01,476
Then he put more pressure on me,

589
00:36:01,477 --> 00:36:03,876
to reveal more
and more sensitive material.

590
00:36:03,877 --> 00:36:05,236
You could've come to me!

591
00:36:05,237 --> 00:36:06,676
I stopped, sir.

592
00:36:06,677 --> 00:36:09,036
I took early maternity leave.

593
00:36:09,037 --> 00:36:11,180
I couldn't bear what I was doing.

594
00:36:12,317 --> 00:36:14,749
Nothing I can say can
make up for what I did.

595
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,540
Yeah, you're not wrong there.

596
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,956
Sir, there's no evidence Maneet
knew Malhotra was

597
00:36:26,957 --> 00:36:29,236
leaking information to an OCG.

598
00:36:29,237 --> 00:36:33,436
And apart from this, sir, she
has got a spotless service history.

599
00:36:33,437 --> 00:36:35,436
Do you hear that, do you?
Do you hear that?

600
00:36:35,437 --> 00:36:36,876
That's good people.

601
00:36:36,877 --> 00:36:38,196
Honest people.

602
00:36:38,197 --> 00:36:40,140
Sticking up for one of their own.

603
00:36:40,837 --> 00:36:43,740
But you have made a mockery of that.

604
00:36:44,757 --> 00:36:46,596
You are finished here, Constable,

605
00:36:46,597 --> 00:36:49,916
you are finished with the force
and that's only the start of it.

606
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:54,556
Christ knows what criminal charges
you're going to end up facing!

607
00:36:54,557 --> 00:36:56,996
Superintendent Hastings leaving the room

608
00:36:56,997 --> 00:36:59,700
before I say something
I'm going to regret.

609
00:37:27,197 --> 00:37:30,517
Thank you, everybody, can I have
your attention, please? Thanks.

610
00:37:32,157 --> 00:37:35,516
Well, it's been one hell of a
journey to this point, hasn't it?

611
00:37:35,517 --> 00:37:38,700
And it's been a right few ups
and downs along the way.

612
00:37:40,277 --> 00:37:43,516
We've even had to suffer corrupt
police officers in our midst.

613
00:37:43,517 --> 00:37:45,516
But small mercies.

614
00:37:45,517 --> 00:37:49,836
Maneet's confession has put
the final nail in Hilton's coffin.

615
00:37:49,837 --> 00:37:52,916
Hilton knew about Malhotra.
Oh, yeah, he was the one.

616
00:37:52,917 --> 00:37:55,436
He was the senior
police officer who was running

617
00:37:55,437 --> 00:37:58,037
the show for organised crime.

618
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:04,500
Killing himself was the only
decent thing that man ever did.

619
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:08,516
H.

620
00:38:08,517 --> 00:38:10,020
Finally.

621
00:38:10,677 --> 00:38:12,636
Well done, everybody.

622
00:38:12,637 --> 00:38:14,276
Well done.

623
00:38:14,277 --> 00:38:17,876
And to celebrate, I am going to put
a few bob behind the bar

624
00:38:17,877 --> 00:38:21,036
in the Red Lion tonight so you can
all have a drink on the gaffer.

625
00:38:21,037 --> 00:38:23,871
And that is something that does
not happen every day. Correct?

626
00:38:23,872 --> 00:38:24,945
That's true, yeah!

627
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,356
So carry on. Thank you very much.
Thank you.

628
00:38:27,357 --> 00:38:28,420
Sir.

629
00:38:33,357 --> 00:38:35,396
Maneet links to Hilton.

630
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:38,236
Hilton to Malhotra. Malhotra to the OCG.

631
00:38:38,237 --> 00:38:40,956
And now there's a UCO inside the OCG.

632
00:38:40,957 --> 00:38:42,756
If anyone can prove the gaffer right,

633
00:38:42,757 --> 00:38:45,916
that Hilton was the one pulling
the strings, it's her.

634
00:38:45,917 --> 00:38:47,477
Or prove him wrong.

635
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:50,717
We need to find her.

636
00:39:26,717 --> 00:39:27,997
Oh, my God.

637
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,370
I fell down the stairs.

638
00:39:33,557 --> 00:39:34,917
Vihaan.

639
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,260
You shouldn't be here.

640
00:39:41,717 --> 00:39:45,356
It's OK, I used a false name on the VO.

641
00:39:45,357 --> 00:39:47,797
Prison Liaison don't know
I'm a police officer.

642
00:39:49,477 --> 00:39:51,476
You can't do nothing.

643
00:39:51,477 --> 00:39:54,260
I can talk some sense into you.

644
00:39:55,637 --> 00:39:57,460
Why'd you even want to help me?

645
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,390
I dobbed you in.

646
00:40:01,757 --> 00:40:03,620
You did the right thing.

647
00:40:04,317 --> 00:40:06,756
I've been living a lie.

648
00:40:06,757 --> 00:40:09,500
Keeping secrets from people
that I care about.

649
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:15,580
I'm sorry, Maneet, for all of it.

650
00:40:17,197 --> 00:40:18,677
I know you are.

651
00:40:21,677 --> 00:40:24,557
Vihaan, come clean to AC-12.

652
00:40:25,597 --> 00:40:30,116
Tell them everything you know
and you'll be out of here sooner.

653
00:40:30,117 --> 00:40:31,980
Look at me.

654
00:40:32,357 --> 00:40:34,357
This is when I don't say nothing.

655
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:40,980
I won't talk. I'd never talk.

656
00:40:44,397 --> 00:40:47,236
You always looked after me.

657
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:49,036
I know.

658
00:40:49,037 --> 00:40:50,597
Hands!

659
00:40:53,462 --> 00:40:55,102
Help me, Maneet.

660
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:59,610
I ain't up to this.

661
00:41:06,109 --> 00:41:07,989
Tell me how I can help.

662
00:41:51,437 --> 00:41:52,980
Nikki's phone.

663
00:41:53,397 --> 00:41:55,517
I've got a betting tip.

664
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:57,430
Wrong number.

665
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:00,260
Odds at 100 to 30.

666
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,750
You sure?

667
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,870
100 to 30.

668
00:42:08,877 --> 00:42:10,797
OK, don't move.

669
00:43:03,597 --> 00:43:05,420
You checked her over?

670
00:43:06,117 --> 00:43:08,997
No weapons, no recording devices.

671
00:43:09,402 --> 00:43:11,162
She's clean.

672
00:43:15,557 --> 00:43:17,460
So, what's all this about?

673
00:43:17,997 --> 00:43:20,100
Vihaan Malhotra.

674
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:22,620
- He won't talk.
- He did talk.

675
00:43:23,277 --> 00:43:24,836
Told you how to get hold of us.

676
00:43:24,837 --> 00:43:26,197
And that's all.

677
00:43:27,357 --> 00:43:30,100
I want a guarantee he's safe inside.

678
00:43:30,517 --> 00:43:31,679
This is family.

679
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,797
No, this is business.

680
00:43:34,797 --> 00:43:36,437
In return for information.

681
00:43:38,317 --> 00:43:39,677
About what?

682
00:43:42,197 --> 00:43:44,060
Police operations.

683
00:43:44,357 --> 00:43:46,917
Investigations that could
damage your business.

684
00:43:48,317 --> 00:43:51,540
I passed information to ACC Hilton.

685
00:43:57,117 --> 00:43:58,997
I could do the same for you.

686
00:44:06,957 --> 00:44:09,700
I've got an idea how we
could help each other out.

687
00:44:50,557 --> 00:44:52,036
Evening, Mr Hastings.

688
00:44:52,037 --> 00:44:53,677
Yeah. Evening.

689
00:44:55,837 --> 00:44:59,116
I just wanted to ask, is that
problem with the toilet fixed?

690
00:44:59,117 --> 00:45:00,636
All sorted, sir.

691
00:45:00,637 --> 00:45:02,076
Good. Good.

692
00:45:02,077 --> 00:45:04,916
Sorry, sir.
There's a reminder on your account.

693
00:45:04,917 --> 00:45:07,516
Oh, yeah, yeah. I think there
was some issue with that.

694
00:45:07,517 --> 00:45:09,996
I mean, I'll make sure
it gets paid next week.

695
00:45:09,997 --> 00:45:11,236
You know, banks!

696
00:45:11,237 --> 00:45:13,077
Screw everything up.

697
00:45:51,007 --> 00:45:53,007
_

698
00:46:04,717 --> 00:46:07,237
Christ sake, this
going to happen or what?

699
00:46:31,437 --> 00:46:33,156
Armed police!

700
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:34,436
Armed police!

701
00:46:34,437 --> 00:46:36,837
- On your knees!
- On your knees!

702
00:46:44,117 --> 00:46:45,756
Where'd that come from?

703
00:46:45,757 --> 00:46:48,236
That weren't there before!

704
00:46:48,237 --> 00:46:49,756
What's the game, man?

705
00:46:49,757 --> 00:46:52,036
What's the game?

706
00:46:52,037 --> 00:46:53,555
Bastards!

707
00:46:53,556 --> 00:46:55,980
Sir, this way.

708
00:46:59,477 --> 00:47:01,077
Open it.

709
00:47:07,117 --> 00:47:08,837
Jackpot.

710
00:47:23,877 --> 00:47:25,020
All right.

711
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:27,340
All right.

712
00:47:28,197 --> 00:47:29,836
What's AC-12's interest in this?

713
00:47:29,837 --> 00:47:31,380
Sorry, Sam.

714
00:47:31,997 --> 00:47:34,876
Detective Chief
Superintendent Hargreaves.

715
00:47:34,877 --> 00:47:37,876
Gaffer thinks he knows the
magic words to make them talk.

716
00:47:37,877 --> 00:47:39,316
Don't they all?

717
00:47:39,317 --> 00:47:41,340
What were you all up to tonight?

718
00:47:42,437 --> 00:47:44,356
No comment.

719
00:47:44,357 --> 00:47:47,380
That van full of H.

720
00:47:48,277 --> 00:47:52,157
Bit careless, to leave it there
for us to catch you red-handed.

721
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:53,963
Not us.

722
00:47:55,597 --> 00:47:58,260
Are you trying to tell me
you didn't hijack the transport?

723
00:47:59,237 --> 00:48:00,860
Not us.

724
00:48:02,189 --> 00:48:03,789
Who then?

725
00:48:04,957 --> 00:48:06,717
Ask the bitch.

726
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,876
A woman?

727
00:48:08,877 --> 00:48:10,397
One that set us up.

728
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,637
Set you up how?

729
00:48:15,037 --> 00:48:16,956
Following the arrests made last night,

730
00:48:16,957 --> 00:48:19,996
the first round of interviews have
been completed by Serious Crime.

731
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:22,556
The following allegations
have been made relating to

732
00:48:22,557 --> 00:48:26,596
controlled drugs seized by an OCG
in the hijack of transport ED-905.

733
00:48:26,597 --> 00:48:29,396
A portion of the heroin
was traded to a rival OCG

734
00:48:29,397 --> 00:48:31,316
for an extremely large amount of cash.

735
00:48:31,317 --> 00:48:33,436
A further trade was
arranged and the heroin

736
00:48:33,437 --> 00:48:36,076
planted at the scene in a van
to incriminate the rival OCG.

737
00:48:36,077 --> 00:48:37,660
Sir.

738
00:48:38,317 --> 00:48:40,636
It's been alleged the whole
thing was orchestrated by

739
00:48:40,637 --> 00:48:44,476
a female OCG member matching
the description of the nominal.

740
00:48:44,477 --> 00:48:47,276
Well, it sounds like the
UCO is finally getting some

741
00:48:47,277 --> 00:48:50,916
dangerous drugs off the street and
some hardened criminals behind bars.

742
00:48:50,917 --> 00:48:52,956
Except, sir, I looked into the tip-off

743
00:48:52,957 --> 00:48:56,557
and the caller used none of the code
words issued to undercover officers.

744
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:58,580
We don't believe it was her, sir.

745
00:48:59,757 --> 00:49:01,317
Right.

746
00:49:02,997 --> 00:49:05,516
Well, let's see what
Detective Superintendent Powell

747
00:49:05,517 --> 00:49:07,700
has to say for herself this time.

748
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:14,717
- All right.
- All right.

749
00:49:16,037 --> 00:49:17,476
What's up?

750
00:49:17,477 --> 00:49:18,797
You tell me.

751
00:49:21,077 --> 00:49:22,636
All went as planned.

752
00:49:22,637 --> 00:49:25,076
We set up the exchange
for the rest of the gear.

753
00:49:25,077 --> 00:49:27,436
The copper did her part, made a call.

754
00:49:27,437 --> 00:49:29,568
They're out of business.
You've got what you wanted.

755
00:49:29,997 --> 00:49:33,916
And this copper? Apart from
make a call, what's she done?

756
00:49:33,917 --> 00:49:36,157
- She's working on it.
- Working on it.

757
00:49:38,357 --> 00:49:40,837
Let's give her time to pan out,
one way or another.

758
00:49:42,077 --> 00:49:43,437
One way.

759
00:49:49,837 --> 00:49:51,557
Or another.

760
00:50:18,277 --> 00:50:20,356
Sorry, sorry. No idea where my head was.

761
00:50:20,357 --> 00:50:22,836
I'm in a rush,
let's just swap insurance details.

762
00:50:27,277 --> 00:50:29,597
Emergency, which service do you require?

763
00:50:44,437 --> 00:50:46,396
What have you got for us?

764
00:50:46,397 --> 00:50:48,780
I haven't had time to
work with my contacts.

765
00:50:50,037 --> 00:50:52,020
What contacts are these?

766
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,156
They don't want anyone knowing.

767
00:50:54,157 --> 00:50:56,077
- You're full of shit.
- John.

768
00:50:59,437 --> 00:51:01,556
My men were following you.

769
00:51:01,557 --> 00:51:03,420
You were on your way to AC-12.

770
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:06,030
That's not true.

771
00:51:07,837 --> 00:51:10,316
Every one of you is so
keen to believe this is all

772
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,717
about protecting her idiot cousin.

773
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:14,743
It's the truth!

774
00:51:17,923 --> 00:51:19,483
She got her burner on her?

775
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:35,036
It's the one we gave her.

776
00:51:43,563 --> 00:51:45,363
Get me a screwdriver.

777
00:52:30,822 --> 00:52:32,382
Christ.

778
00:52:32,597 --> 00:52:35,230
You've got to believe me. It wasn't
there when we gave it to her, John.

779
00:52:35,231 --> 00:52:36,740
I'll deal with you later.

780
00:52:37,603 --> 00:52:39,283
Get out of my sight.

781
00:52:43,763 --> 00:52:45,483
What's going to happen?

782
00:52:48,637 --> 00:52:51,500
There's only one thing
worse than a bent copper,

783
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:55,070
that's a bent copper
who pretends she isn't.

784
00:53:02,797 --> 00:53:04,796
No!

785
00:53:04,797 --> 00:53:06,836
No!

786
00:53:06,837 --> 00:53:09,076
No! Please!

787
00:53:39,517 --> 00:53:41,020
Right.

788
00:53:41,557 --> 00:53:44,894
So, we have a betting shop robbery,
we have the recruitment

789
00:53:44,895 --> 00:53:48,716
and blackmail of a civilian
administrator, we have a hijack,

790
00:53:48,717 --> 00:53:53,996
we have narcotics traded, we have a
rival organised crime gang framed.

791
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:56,876
We have three police officers murdered,

792
00:53:56,877 --> 00:54:01,036
one seriously injured, and the
whole time, your UCO has failed to

793
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:04,596
pass on any intelligence that would
have prevented these offences?

794
00:54:04,597 --> 00:54:06,036
I've already told you,

795
00:54:06,037 --> 00:54:09,876
I'm not at liberty to discuss
any ongoing undercover operation.

796
00:54:09,877 --> 00:54:14,556
I'll give you, "At liberty,"
Detective Superintendent Powell.

797
00:54:14,557 --> 00:54:18,556
If a UCO is committing crimes,
that's the business of AC-12.

798
00:54:18,557 --> 00:54:21,076
And if you have any doubts, you just
watch how fast I'm going to

799
00:54:21,077 --> 00:54:24,112
shut down this operation
and serve you, your COM

800
00:54:24,113 --> 00:54:26,900
and your UCO with Reg 15s.

801
00:54:37,596 --> 00:54:40,140
It's called Operation Pear Tree.

802
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:44,596
Our brief was to embed
an undercover officer

803
00:54:44,597 --> 00:54:46,436
within an organised crime group.

804
00:54:46,437 --> 00:54:48,276
Now we're getting somewhere.

805
00:54:48,277 --> 00:54:50,437
So here's a simple question.

806
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:53,540
Are you in contact
with your UCO or aren't you?

807
00:54:56,517 --> 00:54:58,076
Now listen, Alison.

808
00:54:58,077 --> 00:55:00,437
I didn't float up the Lagan on a bubble.

809
00:55:01,903 --> 00:55:03,263
Are you or aren't you?

810
00:55:05,476 --> 00:55:06,556
No.

811
00:55:08,437 --> 00:55:13,196
Right. So your COM's lost contact,
your cover officers, too?

812
00:55:13,197 --> 00:55:15,276
We're trying our best.

813
00:55:15,277 --> 00:55:16,877
- Christ.
- How long?

814
00:55:20,037 --> 00:55:24,236
How long has your Covert Operations
Manager not been in contact

815
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:25,796
with your UCO?

816
00:55:25,797 --> 00:55:27,100
Days?

817
00:55:28,449 --> 00:55:29,889
Weeks?

818
00:55:31,716 --> 00:55:33,756
Mother of God, don't tell me it's months!

819
00:55:33,781 --> 00:55:37,221
We can't be certain what's happened.
It's a deep cover operation.

820
00:55:37,397 --> 00:55:39,476
He may still be acquiring intelligence

821
00:55:39,477 --> 00:55:41,317
on organised criminal activity.

822
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:43,170
He?

823
00:55:54,397 --> 00:55:56,357
Detective Sergeant John Corbett.

824
00:56:16,197 --> 00:56:18,397
Come on! Come on, you!

825
00:56:19,637 --> 00:56:22,660
Please! No, please!

826
00:56:32,197 --> 00:56:34,213
- No, no!
- Shut up!

827
00:56:34,214 --> 00:56:36,357
This ain't helping.

827
00:56:37,305 --> 00:57:37,405

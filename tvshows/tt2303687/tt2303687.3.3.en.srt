1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:04,460
So many years, I wondered what I'd
do if I ever saw him again.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,700
And then, I did.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,860
In a photo, in a briefing room.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,820
And I was being sent
to meet him with a gun.

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,060
This programme contains scenes which
some viewers may find upsetting.

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,500
When this is all done,
Steve, I'll suffer for my actions.

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,500
I'm under no
illusions of a happy ending.

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,540
Shot fired!

9
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,300
What's he saying? He whispered
something to you. What did he say?

10
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,820
I'm not sure what he meant.

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,860
My job is to find any
and all evidence.

12
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,380
And what was found in the case?
A large number of banknotes.

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,060
How did Detective Sergeant Arnott
react? He didn't bat an eye.

14
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,500
I don't think we should close the investigation
into Danny Waldron's background.

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,540
I'd like to keep digging.

16
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,420
There's evidence of
prolonged torture.

17
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,020
Cause of death isn't clear.

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,900
Cutting his head off
can't have helped.

19
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,980
This photograph shows Danny
Waldron as a teenager.

20
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,900
This man's a young Ronan Murphy,

21
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,740
the suspect shot by Danny Waldron
during Operation Damson.

22
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,980
What? They knew each other?

23
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,300
And this person bears a strong semblance
to Linus Murphy's severed head.

24
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,460
Danny knew him too.

25
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,740
No prior information of the
operation to move Tommy Hunter.

26
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,420
I had no prior... knowledge.

27
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,020
No prior knowledge, at all.

28
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,597
Kate knows about me
and Jackie and Danny.

29
00:01:22,622 --> 00:01:23,917
I've got to come clean to AC-12.

30
00:01:23,942 --> 00:01:25,580
The longer I leave it,
the worse it looks.

31
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,140
It is with deep regret
that I inform you all

32
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,252
of the death of PC Rod Kennedy.

33
00:01:30,277 --> 00:01:33,380
Rod's body was found
hanged at an industrial unit.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,074

35
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,220
We need to talk.

36
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,380
You are now declaring

37
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,300
that PC Rod Kennedy
killed Sergeant Daniel Waldron?

38
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,860
Yes, sir.

39
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,460
Rod killed Danny.

40
00:02:15,614 --> 00:02:17,340
Look, I'm sorry about this.

41
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,060
It's just that I've got no-one else
to talk to right now.

42
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,500
It's fine.

43
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,260
Look, mate, I don't think
I can keep going into the station.

44
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,140
All the stuff that's going
on behind our backs.

45
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,340
All the stuff that's
going on to our faces.

46
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,700
Yeah, well, Rod was a good bloke,
weren't he?

47
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,140
You know, people can't get
their heads round it.

48
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,500
Yeah.

49
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,103
I can see why.

50
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,140
Look, Jackie,
don't do this to yourself.

51
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,500
My hands were on that gun
and I felt Rod force the trigger.

52
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,500
He killed Danny.

53
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,820
You know, we was right to
stick together,

54
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,340
you know, when he was here,
but now he's gone.

55
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,780
We've got to move on.

56
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,980
Ah, come here.

57
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,540
Superintendent Hastings.
"Hi, sorry to bother you, sir."

58
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,580
I just followed Jackie Brickford
to a meeting with Hari Bains.

59
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,860
"He seems pretty bloody
shifty to me."

60
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,460
Dot.

61
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,740
Just so you know, I've authorised
Kate to adopt

62
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,420
direct surveillance on Hari Bains.
Nice one, Gaffer.

63
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,180
Yes, and I want Steve in on it too.
Absolutely.

64
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,780
Steve, get yourself get yourself
over to South Ferry

65
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,420
when Hari Bains comes on shift.

66
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,180
Be visible. Sir.

67
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,020
Come in. Inspector McAndrew,
DS Arnott, AC-12.

68
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,660
What do you want?

69
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,300
In an interview gave at AC-12
you informed us that Hari Bains

70
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,660
had a good working relationship
with Danny Waldron.

71
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,060
Yeah, so?

72
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,220
Hari never made any complaints
about Danny?

73
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,660
If anything, the opposite.

74
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,060
How so, Ma'am?

75
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,620
I was due to rotate
Hari from Danny's squad,

76
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,260
but Hari said that he respected
Danny's professionalism

77
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,180
and wanted to ride on
more jobs with him. Really?

78
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,100
When did he say this?

79
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,380
Couple of days
before the Abbots Lane op.

80
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,740
You mean a couple of days before
the op that got Danny killed?

81
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,660
I was all set to disband
Danny's team

82
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,500
after the shooting
of Ronan Murphy

83
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,500
and there is no way you're going
to pin some blame on me

84
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,780
just because you're struggling
to find a scapegoat.

85
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,180
Thank you, Ma'am.
You've been very helpful.

86
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,820
'AC-12.' DC Fleming. Put me through
to telecommunications, please.

87
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,340
'Telecoms.' DC Fleming.

88
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,700
I need an identification on the last
number dialled from a payphone

89
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,980
on the corner of Calman Road
and Turner Road. 'Stand by.'

90
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:20,220
'The number you have called
is not recognised. Please check the number.'

91
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,340
'The number you have called is...'

92
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,660
Kate reports Bains attempted
to make a call to this number.

93
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,540
It relates to an unregistered
pay-as-you-go mobile.

94
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,140
Now, the call couldn't be connected

95
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,940
because either the phone or
the SIM Card was out of service.

96
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,940
I've got Maneet liaising with
the mobile network provider to see

97
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,020
what information
we can get about the number. Great.

98
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,500
Tell Kate I want her on
Hari Bains round the clock.

99
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,860
Yeah, will do, Gaffer.

100
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,700
'What the
bloody hell are you playing at?

101
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,220
'Making a call from a public box?

102
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,500
'That's why we sent you
the unregistered mobiles.'

103
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,740
The text came through to my own
phone, so I thought...

104
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,980
'Yeah, well, we had to get
a message to you urgently

105
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,020
'and you weren't answering.
You're being watched by AC-12.'

106
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,540
I didn't see anyone.
'What did the text say?'

107
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,900
"Sit tight. Act normal."

108
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,740
So how's this acting normal?
Dickhead.

109
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,260
All right? All right?

110
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,580
Look, for my two penn'orth, I
think we're flogging a dead horse

111
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,100
with Bains and Brickford.

112
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,140
Rod Kennedy killed Danny Waldron,

113
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,380
couldn't handle the guilt,
he topped himself.

114
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,820
Maybe it wasn't suicide.

115
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,740
We ought to request a second
postmortem on Rod Kennedy's body.

116
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,900
The first one was only
looking for cause of death.

117
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,620
We should get a Home Office
pathologist

118
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,420
looking for evidence of crime.

119
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,620
Sure.

120
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,780
Leave that with me. Cheers.

121
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,380
Do you like chilli?

122
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,300
The food.

123
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,220
Not the country.

124
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,860
I've got a pot... on the simmer.

125
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,900
You've probably eaten.

126
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,100
No, I haven't, actually.

127
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,100
Well?

128
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,740
Yeah.

129
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,780
Not too fiery? I'll cope.

130
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,380
If you go to the
trouble of making a pot,

131
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,980
you might as well make it last
a few days, you know?

132
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,900
One night, you can have it with
rice. One night, baked potato...

133
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,460
It's rock and roll, me.

134
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,420
Well, I'm not complaining.

135
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,380
By the time I knock off, the only
thing that's open is a dodgy kebab.

136
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,260
That's undercover, isn't it?
Stupid hours.

137
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,340
Well, Mark works in IT.

138
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,780
He did a lot from home,
which was great for childcare.

139
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,340
Just not so great for us.

140
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,420
You still see the kid, though? Yeah.

141
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,460
Sorry, I shouldn't poke my nose in.
No, it's fine.

142
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:10,620
It was the right decision. You know,
give him security and stability.

143
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,740
Just not such a great
decision for me, to be honest.

144
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,460
See, me and my missus,
we never got around to having kids.

145
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,100
Was she a copper too? Forensics.
I don't see much of her now.

146
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,900
No? No, I was on the
piss most nights.

147
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,500
Couldn't pass a bookie's.

148
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,940
Final straw was - we'd put down
half on a fortnight in Majorca.

149
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,260
Oh, don't tell me.

150
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,100
Yeah, five-to-one. Dead cert.

151
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,860
I couldn't go home to face
the music, so...

152
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,540
I took out a loan,

153
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,100
put a grand down on the last race of
the day, try and win it all back...

154
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,660
Barrel of laughs, me, yeah.

155
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,580
Can I have your bowl? Cheers.

156
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,380
Hey, there's seconds here
if you fancy?

157
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,580
Any more
and I won't get off this sofa.

158
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,260
Yeah? I've got something
for you, Sarge.

159
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,900
"On that photo found at Danny's."
Yeah, sure.

160
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,380
It's from a boys' home
called Sands View.

161
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,100
Danny Waldron's mum died when he
was 11, and he moved up north to

162
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,620
live with his dad and stepmum, but that
didn't work out and he got taken into care.

163
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,260
Danny was a resident at Sands View
from the age of 13 until he was 17.

164
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,860
I keep going through the file.

165
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,740
There's no link between Danny Waldron and
Ronan Murphy while Danny was a police officer.

166
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,700
The only link must
be this boys' home.

167
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,500
Unfortunately, I can't get
hold of any records for that period.

168
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,860
One council department
told me they were lost in a fire,

169
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,300
another told me they went missing
during an office move.

170
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,020
You think they've
been lost on purpose?

171
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,780
Who knows? The lads were
chucked out at 17 and pretty much

172
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,100
left to fend for themselves,
with no follow-up.

173
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,740
However, I've crosschecked
with individuals known

174
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,380
to the criminal justice system
and I've got a name for you.

175
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,500
Same age as Danny,

176
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,180
so chances are they were
there at the same time.

177
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,060
Good work.

178
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,540
Hey, Joe. Joe!

179
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,820
Joseph Nash? Yeah?

180
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,340
Can I talk to you
somewhere quieter, please?

181
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,540
Yeah.

182
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,500
I'd like to show you a photograph,
if that's all right.

183
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,220
It's a photocopy of an original
image believed to be

184
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,180
approximately 15 to 20 years old.

185
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,500
Do you recognise the image? Yeah.

186
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,740
Do you recall
the name of this location? Yes.

187
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,900
Mr Nash, you're not in any trouble.

188
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,780
How did you find out my name?

189
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,700
I'm not going to lie. You committed
a number of minor offences.

190
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,940
Look, I was just a kid, back then.

191
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,380
I've put my life back together now.
The convictions are spent.

192
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:22,100
It was only that your record crosschecked
with an enquiry I'm involved with.

193
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,100
An enquiry into Sands View?

194
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,860
Connected to Sands View.

195
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,020
Do you recognise this individual?

196
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,460
Yes, Danny. Danny Waldron. Yeah.

197
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,380
Do you recognise this individual?

198
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,740
Yes.

199
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,940
What do you remember
about that person?

200
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,660
He took us for football on
a Tuesday afternoon.

201
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,540
He was one of the staff?
No, he just took us for footie.

202
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,340
What else do you recall about him?

203
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,820
You're being a big help, Joe.

204
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,740
Is it OK if I ask you
about one more person?

205
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,420
This man, here.

206
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,460
Him.

207
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,740
Who is he?

208
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,260
Mr Murphy. He was the caretaker.

209
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,820
The other man.

210
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,460
The football coach. Was his name
Murphy too? Might have been.

211
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,660
They was a pair.

212
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,140
A pair?

213
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,180
The older one, the caretaker,
he had the keys.

214
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,500
For the dormitories.

215
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,300
Changing rooms, the basement.

216
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,940
But him, the younger one...

217
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,660
...he was in on it too.

218
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,100
With the others.

219
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,980
What others?

220
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,420
Just... Not in the photo.

221
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,940
Visitors.

222
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,340
We got told they were
very important people

223
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,900
and we had to do exactly...
what they said.

224
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,860
Did you ever get the names
of any of these people?

225
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,460
No. No-one ever got any names.

226
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,460
And even if we did, it was just...

227
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,620
Mr Smith.

228
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,140
What happened with these visitors?

229
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,540
Well, sometimes they'd...

230
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,500
...they'd come to the home

231
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,460
and we'd be told it
was like a private interview.

232
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,780
"Mr Smith can be a big help to you
when you move on," sort of thing.

233
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,980
You know?

234
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,860
And then you go to
a room with Mr Smith.

235
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,460
Or a few of you would.

236
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,580
With a few of them.

237
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,940
The abuse always took place within Sands
View? No, not always. There was, erm...

238
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,300
sometimes there'd
be a car or a minibus

239
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,820
and they'd take us to a hotel,
or a guesthouse, or some big...

240
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,460
...some big private home.

241
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,100
You know?

242
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,700
But the parties...

243
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,940
The parties, they were the worst.

244
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,540
Parties?

245
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,340
There'd be a few of them,
these, these VIPs...

246
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,580
And we'd be farmed out.

247
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,700
Do you recall any
details in terms of names,

248
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,500
addresses, or the people who drove
you to and from these parties?

249
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,820
This was a long time ago,
all right, mate?

250
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,940
And I wish I could remember
that information

251
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,540
and forget about the rest, but...

252
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,820
...it's the opposite.

253
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,700
I know this is hard, Joe.

254
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,940
Is there anything you can tell me

255
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,340
about these individuals
that might help identify them?

256
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,500
Yeah, there's one of them...
stands out.

257
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,460
He's a...

258
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,220
He's a big...

259
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,420
big fat whale of a fella.

260
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,260
He always wore a suit.

261
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,900
And when he took the suit jacket
off, he always had these, these,

262
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,780
these sweat patches and...
he stank of it.

263
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,580
And when I got told he'd
asked for me again, I'd...

264
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,260
I'd throw up, you know?

265
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,900
I'd be sick.

266
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,380
Is Danny the one?

267
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,180
The one?

268
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,620
Yeah.

269
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,820
He's got people listening to us,
at last.

270
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,540
Yeah.

271
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,700
Yeah, he is.

272
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,420
Arnott. Any report yet on the
second PM? What second PM?

273
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,820
Dot said he was organising a second
postmortem on Rod Kennedy.

274
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,500
First I've heard of it.

275
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,780
Leave it with me.

276
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,860
OK, I'll head back to South Ferry.

277
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,700
Right, I'll tell her.

278
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,060
Francis, that was your rep.

279
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,260
AC-12 want you in for interview
straight away.

280
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,780
She doesn't know anything. She never
believed us, not for a minute.

281
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,980
Jackie, she weren't in the room
when Danny was shot.

282
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,380
But he whispered something
to her as he was dying. Yeah.

283
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,460
And if he managed to tell
her the truth,

284
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,620
do you think she would've kept
quiet this whole time?

285
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,020
No.

286
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,820
Trust me, she don't know anything.

287
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,860
Yeah?

288
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,620
All right, mate.

289
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,380
I've continued to search records
relating to Sands View.

290
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,940
Our witness, Joseph Nash,
claims a number of his abusers

291
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,540
were VIPs, all of whom
used the same alias, Mr Smith.

292
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,820
Hence Nash wasn't able
to give us any names.

293
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,220
But he did claim one of these
abusers was extremely obese.

294
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,780
Sports day at Sands View.

295
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,220
Who is he? Dale Roach.

296
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,660
He was leader of the
city council during the period

297
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,900
Danny Waldron and Joe Nash
were residents at Sands View.

298
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,740
Is this the man, Joe?

299
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,180
Yeah, that's him.

300
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,300
Thank you.

301
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,900
Now, it would help
if you would come to my department

302
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,980
and look through some images
of other individuals...

303
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,780
Joe, I came from a loving family.

304
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,060
Had a nice childhood

305
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,180
and I can't begin to imagine
what yours must have been like.

306
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,700
20 years...

307
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,700
...it's took you to come here.
I want to help.

308
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,100
20 years...

309
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,980
I've had that monster in my head.

310
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,620
The sounds he made,
the smell of him.

311
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,780
And the things that he did to us
at Sands View...

312
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,780
No copper ever gave a toss.

313
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,260
Are you saying offences
committed at Sands View

314
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,380
were reported to police
and no action was taken?

315
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,260
We told teachers, we told social
workers, and yeah...

316
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,020
...we told coppers.

317
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,540
And then, we learned not to.

318
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,620
Danny Waldron's dead, Joe.

319
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,460
He was killed because
he was going after the people

320
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,580
who did this to you.

321
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,300
Danny's mission is now my mission.

322
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,300
And I promise you,
I will get these bastards.

323
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,660
Daddy! Daddy!

324
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,340
Hey! Hello, you!

325
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,620
Is that for me? Mm-hm.
Well, thank you very much.

326
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,340
And I will always,
always love you, OK? Mm-hm.

327
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,660
Come here.

328
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,900
How long has he been here?

329
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,300
I'd have to check.
Two or three years at least.

330
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,460
Any family?

331
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,700
No family, no visitors.

332
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,700
Mr Roach.

333
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,700
Mr Roach?!

334
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,420
Can he hear me?

335
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,140
He doesn't understand much.
He can't talk.

336
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,780
What's wrong with him?
Massive stroke.

337
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,020
Sorry, do you need me to stay?

338
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,140
No. Thank you.
Call if you need me.

339
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,180
Mr Roach, do you recognise
the name "Sands View Boys' Home"?

340
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,580
Mr Roach?

341
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,460
I'm Detective Sergeant Steve Arnott.

342
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,460
I'm investigating claims
relating to Sands View.

343
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,060
Do you understand me?!

344
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,740
Danny Waldron recognised
Ronan Murphy as an occasional

345
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,900
sports volunteer
at Sands View Boys' Home.

346
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,820
Somehow, from Ronan, he was able
to track down Linus Murphy.

347
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:42,380
Linus was the caretaker at Sands
View and used his position

348
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,060
to include Ronan, his nephew,
in his activities.

349
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,220
Now, a witness has given us
another name - Dale Roach.

350
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,420
Councillor Dale Roach.

351
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,060
Unfortunately,
Roach isn't fit to stand trial.

352
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,380
I think Danny Waldron purposefully
created a trail of evidence

353
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,420
that led us to connect him
to Linus Murphy's murder.

354
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,860
And now, we're on the trail
of the other abusers.

355
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,980
There is only one thing
we are interested in here, son,

356
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,900
and one thing only.

357
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,260
And that's bent coppers.
The boys made complaints.

358
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,860
Some allegedly to police officers.

359
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,620
Thank you, Steve.

360
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,460
Sir.

361
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,620
Hi. Kate?

362
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,500
Come in.

363
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,980
Something wrong?

364
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,020
You didn't come back to the station.

365
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:08,180
By the time I'd finished with
AC-12, my shift was over.

366
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,340
So, what's going on?

367
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,460
They just wanted to go over the
details of the day Danny was killed,

368
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,340
times, places.

369
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:18,300
You know what they're like,
fishing for inconsistencies.

370
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,660
Anything they can pounce on.
And did they?

371
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,900
Did they what? Pounce.

372
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,940
We shouldn't talk about this.
What did you tell them, Kate?

373
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,740
We can't have this conversation.
You should leave. I need to know!

374
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,300
You keep asking me
to leave you alone.

375
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,060
Congratulations, you're on your own.

376
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,900
What do they know, Kate?
You should go.

377
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,460
What do they know?

378
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,180
They're onto the pair of you.

379
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,580
What about us?

380
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,060
They know Hari stopped McAndrew
from disbanding Danny's squad.

381
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,420
What?!

382
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,660
I never knew anything about that!
And they know about the phone calls.

383
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:02,460
What phone calls? Yeah, right
"What phone calls?" Bye, Jackie.

384
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,860
What phone calls, Kate?!

385
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,140
They've got Hari making calls
from a phone box

386
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:11,340
to an unregistered
pay-as-you-go number.

387
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,780
They know it must be a phone
you're using covertly.

388
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,500
You two are in collusion,
and developing your strategy

389
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,940
using untraceable telephone calls.
It's not me he's been calling.

390
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,460
Stay here, I'll get it.

391
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,900
So, what's up, then?

392
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,220
Who've you been calling?

393
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,820
What? AC-12 know you've been
making dodgy calls.

394
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,100
They think I'm in on it!

395
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,780
All this time, we trusted you.
It was just the three of us.

396
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,340
Now, Rod's dead and that still
isn't the end of it!

397
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,020
Jackie, what are you...?

398
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,940
Who have you been making
those calls to?

399
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,740
What aren't you telling me?!

400
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,500
I haven't been making any calls,
all right? It's just me and you,

401
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,820
and as long as we stick
together, then...

402
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,940
Jackie, I've been telling
you the truth.

403
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,980
Yeah, I'm sorry, I know it's late.

404
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,980
I need to go in and see AC-12...

405
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,460
...and I'm going to need
your solicitor.

406
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,820
Stand away from the door. >

407
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,260
Ms Denton, you remain under oath.
Thank you, milady.

408
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,380
Ms Denton...

409
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,500
In your examination-in-chief, by
your own counsel,

410
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,620
you made a number of references
to an undercover operation

411
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:54,140
conducted by a Detective Sergeant
Arnott of Anti-Corruption Unit 12.

412
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,500
Yes, I did.

413
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,540
Did any of these operations
involve Detective Sergeant Arnott

414
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,020
being present at your home?
Some did.

415
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,380
You were alone with Detective
Sergeant Arnott? Sometimes.

416
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,020
And on all these occasions,

417
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,380
there were no other police
officers in the vicinity?

418
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,820
There was a constable
stationed outside the house.

419
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,940
Where outside? On the doorstep.

420
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:16,860
And where did sexual relations
take place? In the bedroom.

421
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,220
And how was the bedroom accessed?
Via the stairs.

422
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,660
And how far do the stairs
lie from the front door?

423
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,340
I don't know, three or four
metres from the front door.

424
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:31,100
From the plans of your home
obtained by the prosecution,

425
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,300
the distance is...

426
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,020
2.7 metres.

427
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,900
If you say so. I don't "say so",

428
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,220
it's a fact.

429
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,620
And if I'm inaccurate,
I'll be corrected.

430
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,460
There are written statements
by all the officers

431
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,660
stationed outside the door in early
October, and not one recalls

432
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:53,060
hearing you and Detective Sergeant
Arnott go upstairs together.

433
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,820
Well, that doesn't surprise me.

434
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,780
It doesn't surprise you that
trained police officers

435
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,420
on guard duty,
in a high state of vigilance,

436
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,900
don't hear the two of you go
upstairs for sex

437
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:06,220
when he or she is less
than three metres away?

438
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,060
We were discreet. Hmm.

439
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,060
You've told the jury
that this intimacy

440
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:16,300
with Detective Sergeant Arnott
won your trust and, therefore,

441
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,140
you permitted him unsupervised
access to your home.

442
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,140
There were times when I was napping
or in the bath or the shower

443
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,220
and he was free to roam the
premises. I trusted him completely.

444
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,780
And you've alleged that on one
of these occasions,

445
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,420
Detective Sergeant Arnott
planted a sum of money

446
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,660
in your late mother's
overnight case.

447
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,060
Did you witness
Detective Sergeant Arnott

448
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,060
bringing the £50,000
into your home? No.

449
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:41,300
Did you ever witness Detective
Sergeant Arnott having access

450
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,820
to tens of thousands of pounds in
cash? He'd hardly do it openly.

451
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,780
Corrupt officers have access
to criminal contacts.

452
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,340
Please answer the question
you've been asked.

453
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,620
Did you ever witness
Detective Sergeant Arnott

454
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,700
with such an enormous sum...

455
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,380
of cash?

456
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,780
I don't know how Steve Arnott
got hold of the money

457
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,380
and then got it into my house.
Ms Denton, you've answered.

458
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,700
And I'm still answering. If I'm
in accurate, I'll be corrected.

459
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,620
Steve Arnott had my complete trust

460
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,660
and the trust of the officers
on guard duty.

461
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,260
He could easily have picked his
moment to plant the money

462
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:18,540
and I firmly believe that that
is the best explanation

463
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,740
for how it came to be there.

464
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,220
Because I had never seen
that money before.

465
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:26,220
Were you aware
that you were under investigation

466
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,540
by Anti-Corruption Unit 12?
Yes, I was.

467
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:31,260
And were you cooperating with that
investigation? Yes, I was.

468
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,140
You were being completely honest,
to the best of your knowledge,

469
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,460
in assisting them
with their enquiries? Yes, I was.

470
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:40,500
And had you always been completely
honest with Anti-Corruption Unit 12?

471
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,580
Please answer, Ms Denton.

472
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:54,460
It was a complex case and there
were many details that were elusive

473
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,660
and, at times,
required further thought

474
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,660
and examination before
I could give a definitive answer.

475
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,980
Did you lie in relation to matters
surrounding the conspiracy

476
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,660
to murder Tommy Hunter?

477
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,580
Ms Denton.

478
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,980
As I said, it was a complex case,

479
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,220
and many details were difficult
to define or recollect.

480
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,500
Did you lie about having
prior knowledge of Hunter? No.

481
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:28,100
You lied about having prior
knowledge of Hunter, didn't you? No.

482
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,700
You told the investigators
lie after lie to confound them,

483
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,140
and to pervert the course
of justice, didn't you?

484
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,940
It wasn't like that.
It was like that.

485
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:39,060
You wove a web of deceit
to confound the investigators

486
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,500
and to protect yourself,

487
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,580
and you have the effrontery to
attempt to deceive this jury. No!

488
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,940
Did you fabricate the improper
relations between you

489
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,540
and Detective Sergeant Arnott? No.

490
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,100
Did you fabricate the planting
of evidence against you? No.

491
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,460
Lindsay Denton, aren't you
an artful, devious person,

492
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:55,340
who has betrayed the trust placed
in her as a police officer... No.

493
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,900
...and haven't you repeatedly
and shamelessly connived

494
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,860
to obstruct those who would bring
you to justice? NO, I HAVEN'T!

495
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,500
Watching that circus
really turned my stomach.

496
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,380
Listen, I owe you an apology
for the other night.

497
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,780
Your... dinner invitation.

498
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,380
You're a married man.

499
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,140
This is it.

500
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,780
But here we are,
two colleagues having a drink,

501
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,660
and the sky hasn't fallen in yet.

502
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,660
Yeah.

503
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,020
Yeah...

504
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:05,540
This is a voluntary interview
by authorised firearms officer

505
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,380
Victor Charlie 53 in the presence

506
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,460
of her Police Federation
representative and solicitor,

507
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,780
by Superintendent Hastings
and DS Arnott.

508
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,700
I want to cooperate.

509
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:21,140
I want to go on record
that I have never, at any time,

510
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:24,500
engaged with any other officer
in covert telecommunications

511
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,660
to knowingly
mislead lawful enquiries.

512
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,140
Glad to hear it.

513
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,700
I also want to clarify...

514
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,780
...some details...

515
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,260
of previous statements
made regarding

516
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,580
the death of
Sergeant Daniel Waldron.

517
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,580
Very good.

518
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,820
Carry on.

519
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,900
I never saw the exact moment
the struggle started.

520
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:53,340
The struggle for the gun that killed
Daniel Waldron.

521
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,740
Neither did Rod.

522
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,340
We had to rely on what Hari...

523
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,420
On what 54 told us.

524
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:06,260
He said that Danny had entered
the room with his firearm drawn

525
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,060
and that he'd turned the gun on 54.

526
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,780
So, you're saying Danny tried
to kill 54?

527
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,180
I'm saying that's only
what 54 told us.

528
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:17,180
He said that Danny turned
the gun on him.

529
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:21,180
54 made a grab for the firearm to
stop Danny from shooting him.

530
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:25,060
There was a struggle for the gun,
Rod and I joined in that struggle.

531
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,300
The gun went off and killed Danny.

532
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,180
Hold on a second, Constable,

533
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,980
this is going way beyond
clarifying a statement.

534
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:37,900
I mean, you are changing
your story all over again, here.

535
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,500
This is the truth, sir.

536
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,780
Well, you need to take a deep
breath...

537
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,180
...and we need to caution you.

538
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,780
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

539
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,540
if you fail to mention,
when questioned,

540
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,580
something you later rely on
in court.

541
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,660
Anything you do say may be used in
evidence. Do you understand?

542
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,500
I understand.

543
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,940
So, now you're saying that Danny
wasn't trying to kill himself.

544
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:05,620
He was trying to kill VC 54,
or so 54 claims? Yes, sir.

545
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,460
That seemed plausible. Why?

546
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:15,060
Danny was bullying us into covering
for him after he shot a suspect.

547
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,820
He moved the suspect's firearm,

548
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,900
and then, he discharged the weapon
narrowly missing 54.

549
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,860
What, you conspired with
Daniel Waldron to provide false

550
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,700
statements regarding the shooting?

551
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,940
Yes, sir.

552
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,180
We were all really scared of Danny.

553
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,860
There was a part of him
that was capable of doing anything.

554
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,540
So, you killed him? No!

555
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,420
It seemed like an accident.

556
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,740
54 convinced me and Rod

557
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,300
that if we said that we'd
killed Danny in self-defence,

558
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,020
that the least we'd be looking
at would be manslaughter.

559
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:54,340
He told us to claim that we were
trying to save Danny...

560
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,860
...and that way, nobody
could blame us for his death.

561
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,620
Yes, but instead of telling
the truth, the three of you went off

562
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,660
and concocted a whole new version
of events.

563
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:06,100
And then, you decided to blame
Rod Kennedy for Danny's death.

564
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,380
I knew Rod was jealous of Danny.

565
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,900
It seemed plausible that
he could have been the one.

566
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,700
You don't believe that any more?
No, sir.

567
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,660
54 initiated the struggle
with that gun.

568
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:23,340
And it's only his word for it
that it was self-defence.

569
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,340
I just don't believe him any more.

570
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,020
I can't cover for 54 any longer.

571
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,820
He convinced me...

572
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,380
to blame Rod.

573
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,420
But I'm not sure that Rod
could have killed Danny.

574
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,580
He wasn't that sort of man.

575
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,820
I betrayed him.

576
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,620
Constable,
you have my sincere condolences

577
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,380
for the deaths of your colleagues.

578
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,540
However, we have a job to do,

579
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:10,180
and that job requires us to
investigate thoroughly

580
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:13,380
and impartially the murder
of one of our own.

581
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,740
And whilst we appreciate
your cooperation here today,

582
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:20,140
you have knowingly misled

583
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,980
this enquiry for weeks...

584
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,700
...on matters of the utmost gravity.

585
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:31,340
Firstly, in respect of the
shooting dead of a suspect.

586
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:35,500
Secondly, in respect of the
loss of life

587
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,900
of an officer in the line of duty,

588
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,020
the withholding
of crucial information,

589
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:44,940
the blatant disregard from your
lawful duty as a police officer

590
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,540
to comply with a criminal
investigation, and therefore,

591
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,820
I am submitting to the Police Board,

592
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,300
that you be served with
a red notice

593
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,260
which is the termination of your
contract as a police officer.

594
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,580
And moreover, I will report
to the Crown Prosecutor

595
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:04,940
regarding perverting the course of
justice and assisting an offender.

596
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,060
Now, you won't be charged
at this time, however,

597
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,740
pending my discussion
with the Crown Prosecutor,

598
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,820
you may be charged
with these offences.

599
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,500
But I thought if I cooperated,
that you'd go easier on me?

600
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,740
A suspension?

601
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,460
A yellow notice?

602
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,340
A fellow officer has been killed.

603
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:28,580
There is no more serious
offence that we investigate.

604
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,580
Now, you may think I am harsh,
Constable...

605
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,260
...but, I know that this is justice.

606
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,740
All rise.

607
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,660
Foreman of the jury, please stand.

608
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,420
Have you reached a verdict
upon which you are all agreed?

609
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,660
No, we have not.

610
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,740
In these circumstances,

611
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,420
I am willing to accept
a majority verdict

612
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,820
upon which ten or more of you agree.

613
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,500
Yes, milady.

614
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,100
All rise.

615
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,900
Pick.

616
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,540
A or B?

617
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,820
A.

618
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,420
The report from the second PM
on PC Kennedy.

619
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,140
Yeah.

620
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:57,220
Boss, sorry, I thought
this shouldn't wait. Yeah, come on.

621
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,820
This something I should
know about, Gaffer?

622
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,900
Yeah, why don't you bring the whole
bloody office with you? Sorry, sir.

623
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,900
The pathologist revised the findings
on Rod Kennedy's postmortem.

624
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,260
She's admitted that they screwed up
on the first one?

625
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,860
Well, the findings are subtle.

626
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,940
But there's a superficial
head injury.

627
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,500
Bruising was hidden under scalp
hair at the back of the head

628
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,300
and minor defensive wounds
on the hands.

629
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,980
Again, very subtle. Unfortunately,

630
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,740
no organic material recovered
from under the fingernails.

631
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,620
None of this is very strong. No,
but I went back over the forensics,

632
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,940
and there were foreign fibres
in Kennedy's clothing.

633
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:34,700
Again, not strong. Similar fibres
were found in Kennedy's nose

634
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,700
and mouth at the second PM.
Right.

635
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,300
Best guess, someone smothered him,

636
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,620
and then hanged him
while he was unconscious.

637
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,260
Well, if Bains killed Danny,

638
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,060
I'll lay you evens
he killed Kennedy, as well.

639
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,020
I need to show you this.

640
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:51,460
Traffic camera vid-caps from the
night of Rod Kennedy's death.

641
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,660
This camera is located less than
half a mile

642
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,340
from the industrial estate.

643
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:59,060
This registration matches
a vehicle registered to...

644
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,460
Harinderpal Bains.

645
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,500
It's definitely
gone over the threshold

646
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,980
for our friend, PC Hari Bains.
Bring him in, Steve.

647
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,500
Good call, Gaffer. Sir.

648
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,180
What happened with the postmortem?
Weren't you supposed to organise it?

649
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:19,940
Yeah, listen, I sent the e-mail,
but I only just saw this morning,

650
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:23,500
it bounced back from the
pathologist's office. Right.

651
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,300
Steve, you're a life-saver.

652
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:35,500
Maneet, get me a update on
Hari Bain's whereabouts. Urgent.

653
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,300
Telecoms.

654
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,940
I'll get hold of Kate
and see if she's on his tail.

655
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:43,940
We need an urgent triangulation
on a suspect's mobile phone.

656
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:49,300
Telephone number, 07591152689.

657
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,500
Yeah. He's at or near home.

658
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,380
Right, could I have concealed
firearms. Organise armed backup.

659
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:04,220
Telecoms triangulation places
Hari Bains at his home address.

660
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:08,780
We understand that his wife and one
child reside at this same address.

661
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:12,460
What? PC Francis is in Bains's
squad. She shouldn't be here.

662
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,780
Correct.

663
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,100
Thank you.

664
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,180
Francis?

665
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,780
Sir.

666
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,780
DI Cottan.

667
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,780
I've been bumped off the op.
Too close to Bains.

668
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:40,780
I need to be in on this, Dot.
Can you make a call? 'No.'

669
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,860
This is too dangerous.
I want you out of it.

670
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,780
Oh, for Christ's sake, Dot!
Sorry, Kate.

671
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:50,020
Set aside that this
is one of our own.

672
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:51,580
Hari Bains is potentially armed

673
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,940
and is considered
to be extremely dangerous.

674
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,300
Let's get this done.

675
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,580
Hello.

676
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:21,780
Kate, you were right about the PM.
Rod Kennedy, he was murdered.

677
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:30,700
Hello? 'You're being fitted up
for murdering Rod Kennedy.'

678
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,500
No, he was fine when I left him.

679
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,820
'Do you hear how guilty
you sound already?'

680
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,500
I don't know what to do.
'Well, I do this for a living.'

681
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,060
If you want a way out,
you'll listen to me.

682
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:02,900
Where's your DI? On his way.
Then I'm the ranking officer.

683
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:06,100
We need Bains alive for information
on the murder of Danny Waldron.

684
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,780
Armed police! Come out with
your hands above your head!

685
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,140
Coming out!

686
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:15,580
Where's Hari? I don't know. He went
into the garage. Can you open it?

687
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:19,340
The keys are on the side. Get her
out of here. Hari, it's McAndrew!

688
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,900
We're opening the garage door.

689
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:26,940
It's jammed.

690
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,220
Wait!

691
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,140
Clear!

692
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,380
Open it.

693
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:41,540
Don't touch the phone.

694
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,020
- Arnott.
- 'I've got eyes on Hari Bains.

695
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,940
'He's just entered
the industrial unit

696
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,660
'where Rod Kennedy's body
was found.'

697
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:01,220
Look, he's probably armed.
Don't move until I bring backup.

698
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,300
'I'm not daft. I'm going
to stay well out of it.'

699
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,740
Thanks, they're on their way.
Come here, come here.

700
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:08,300
Secure that phone.
I've got obs on Bains. Follow me!

701
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:15,620
Kate, I got obs on Bains.

702
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,700
I'm en route to the industrial unit
where Rod Kennedy was found.

703
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,620
Cheers, Steve, I'm on my way.

704
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:07,980
Seriously?

705
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,100
Of all the places to run, mate.

706
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:12,700
Where are you going, now?

707
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:21,060
What are you doing here?
I'm just minding my own business.

708
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,340
Re-examining an old crime scene.

709
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,900
You expecting someone else?

710
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:32,380
Who? Don't know what
you're on about, mate.

711
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,500
Well, have it your own way.

712
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,940
I was just trying to give you
a chance before the circus arrives!

713
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,620
A chance of what?

714
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:59,740
The way I see it, it's your word
against Jackie Brickford's.

715
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:03,180
Now, if you're seen to be cooperating
with the enquiry, then...

716
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:06,460
it doesn't take a genius to figure
out who they'll believe, eh?

717
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:10,180
Listen, boy, I don't trust you
as far as I can throw you.

718
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,540
This is where your mate Rod died.

719
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:16,100
We've just had the postmortem
report in.

720
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,700
He was murdered.

721
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,060
You see, that's what I'm doing here.

722
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,300
You...?

723
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,100
Well, that's not very clever, is it?

724
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,660
Returning to the scene of the crime.

725
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:31,460
I had nothing to do with that.
I believe you, mate.

726
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,420
I do.

727
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:36,140
And frankly, between the two of us,

728
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,220
the forensics aren't that strong.

729
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,820
But will Hastings?

730
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,460
Hm? Will the CPS?

731
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,900
See, this is that chance
I was talking about.

732
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,780
Now, starting with Danny Waldron,
before he died,

733
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:57,820
did he ever confide anything to you
about those two pervs he killed?

734
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:00,500
No, he never said owt.
You think carefully.

735
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,820
Ronan Murphy and Linus Murphy
were the blokes he killed.

736
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:08,900
Did he ever mention any other names?
Politicians? Coppers? No. Think.

737
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:12,180
Tommy Hunter and Lindsay Denton.

738
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,660
What would Danny have
to say about them?

739
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:20,700
All right.
So, who are you here to meet?

740
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,780
I don't know.

741
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:25,580
I never met him.

742
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,260
I don't know anything about him.

743
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,540
Nothing.

744
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,780
No, nothing.

745
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,540
Have it your own way, mate.

746
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:35,500
Look, you don't understand.

747
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,340
What don't I understand?!

748
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:40,100
Man, I'm just small fry. Steady.

749
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,420
It's just my phone.

750
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:45,340
Look, it's unregistered.
They can't trace it.

751
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,580
I'll call them for you now, yeah?

752
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,060
Yeah.

753
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:04,260
'The number you have called is not
recognised. Please check the number.

754
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:09,020
'The number you have called is not
recognised. Please check the number.

755
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,340
'The number you have called...'

756
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,140
There is no bloke.

757
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:17,940
It's all you!

758
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:20,900
You killed Danny Waldron.

759
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,980
You persuaded your mates
to lie about it,

760
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,820
and then, when Rod Kennedy wanted
to come clean, you killed him?

761
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:27,700
No, none of that's true.

762
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:31,900
I never killed Rod.

763
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,820
Go!

764
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:02,300
Armed police!

765
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,140
AC-12, don't shoot!

766
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,820
Stay down, hands behind your head!

767
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:08,380
Cuff him! ..You OK, Dot? Yeah.

768
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:17,980
Harinderpal Bains, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Roderick Kennedy.

769
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:20,540
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

770
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:22,700
if you fail to mention,
when questioned,

771
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,700
something you later rely on
in court.

772
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:27,380
Anything you do say,
may be used in evidence. Key.

773
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:30,020
What the hell are you doing here,
Francis?

774
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,740
DC Fleming, Ma'am. AC-12.

775
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:33,380
What happened?

776
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:34,860
Just take a look.

777
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:57,260
When I got here, Bains jumped me.

778
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:00,460
You know, he was going to string me
up the same way he did Rod Kennedy.

779
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,620
I shouldn't have gone in
without backup, sir.

780
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,700
I just didn't want him
to get away, you know?

781
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,100
Well, nobody's going
to question your judgment.

782
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,580
You did a grand job, son.

783
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:10,220
Now, take yourself off
to the hospital

784
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,260
and get yourself a checkup.
Go on, off you go.

785
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,780
Cheers, Gaffer. Yeah.

786
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:16,460
Inspector, we're going to take
this man into our custody,

787
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:17,860
but I'd like you to give us

788
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:20,460
one of your crews to ride shotgun.
Yes, sir.

789
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:24,900
You're lucky AC-12 got to you first.

790
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:29,180
My team, we're following! The rest
of you, back to the station.

791
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:30,700
< You heard the guv.

792
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,100
Have you anything to say?

793
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,940
Take him away. Steve...

794
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,060
You OK, Dot? Yeah, I'll live.

795
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,420
Minor facial injury... >

796
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:22,220
Jury's coming back.
You're free to come in, if you want.

797
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:23,660
I'll wait here.

798
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:52,140
Will the defendant please stand?

799
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:57,540
Will the foreman of the jury
please stand?

800
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:06,420
A search of Hari Bains' home
uncovered a cache of mobile phones.

801
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,900
All of the unregistered,
pay-as-you-go variety.

802
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:12,420
Finding these phones allowed us
to examine their call history.

803
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,980
Hari Bains received a call
the night before going to

804
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:18,180
Inspector McAndrew and volunteering
to stay on Danny's squad.

805
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:19,860
And who was the call from?

806
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:23,940
Well, unfortunately, it was also
an unregistered pay-as-you-go phone,

807
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:26,140
and said phone
is no longer in history.

808
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:29,620
Same MO as the recent text Bains
received, telling him to sit tight.

809
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,540
Three days later, there's another
call from the same number.

810
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:35,180
That was the night before Bains
murdered Danny Waldron.

811
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,620
You think they're connected?
Well, if they are, sir,

812
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:41,180
it means somebody's
been pulling the strings.

813
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:43,620
Someone who ordered Danny's murder.
Well done, Dot!

814
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:52,580
Welcome back, Dot! Thanks, Gaffer.
Great work, sir. Cheers.

815
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,740
On the charge
of conspiracy to murder,

816
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:57,420
have you reached a verdict upon
which at least ten of you agree?

817
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:59,260
We have. What is your verdict?

818
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:01,740
Not guilty.

819
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:04,940
On the charge of perverting
the course of justice,

820
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:08,140
have you reached a verdict upon
which at least ten of you agree?

821
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:11,180
We have. What is your verdict?

822
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:12,460
Guilty.

823
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:15,580
Members of the jury,

824
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:19,140
thank you for your time
and efforts in this complex case.

825
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,580
You are now dismissed.

826
00:55:27,611 --> 00:55:29,666
I'm putting you in
for a commendation.

827
00:55:29,691 --> 00:55:32,171
Sir, I don't deserve that.
Will you listen to this fella?

828
00:55:32,196 --> 00:55:34,549
Single-handedly brings in an AFO,

829
00:55:34,729 --> 00:55:36,557
who killed two coppers
in cold blood,

830
00:55:36,582 --> 00:55:38,820
and for all he knew, he could
have been armed to the teeth.

831
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:41,900
I'll give you,
"Don't deserve it". Thanks, sir.

832
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:46,380
'Lindsay Denton,

833
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:49,820
'for the offence of perverting
the course of justice, '

834
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:54,140
I impose a sentence
of 38 months' imprisonment.

835
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:59,062
Since you have already served
the custodial term of that sentence,

836
00:55:59,087 --> 00:56:02,127
your immediate release
on license will follow.

837
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:04,506
You are now free to go.

838
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,780
All rise.

839
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:39,340
I can't believe it.

840
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:40,780
They've let her out on license.

841
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:44,740
Lindsay! Lindsay! There she is!

842
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:50,500
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like
to make a brief statement

843
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,180
on behalf of my client.

844
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:55,940
My client would like to thank
the men and women of the jury,

845
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:58,860
who were faced
with a complex case...

846
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:00,820
585 days,

847
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:02,620
and on every single one

848
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:06,100
I thought about what I would do
when this moment finally came.

849
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,140
I forgive you.

850
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:14,740
...Unanswered about the tragic,
shocking events

851
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:18,060
of the 5th September 2013.

852
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:20,940
Who's the real guilty party,
Lindsay?

853
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:22,660
I'd like to thank the jury.

854
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:25,940
Do you believe you were set up? Do
you think you were framed, Lindsay?

855
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:28,100
I'd just like to get on
with the rest of my life.

856
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,260
'Lindsay, what is your...?

857
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,100
'Who set you up?'

858
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:45,300
I'd like to thank
the jury for their decision.

859
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,620
'Who set you up?'

860
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:55,700
'Earlier today,
the former detective inspector

861
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,380
'was acquitted of the charges
of conspiracy to murder.'

862
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:07,380
'Lindsay! Lindsay!'

863
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:09,860
'I'd just like to
get on with my life.'

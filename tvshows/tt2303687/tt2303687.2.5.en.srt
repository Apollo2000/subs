00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,620
I'm arresting you for conspiracy
to murder a protected witness.

2
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:16,319
You've been talking to AC-12.

3
00:00:18,799 --> 00:00:19,998
What is it?

4
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:21,078
Tracking device.

5
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:23,998
We were investigating Denton. It
didn't matter what route she took -

6
00:00:23,999 --> 00:00:25,719
the ambushers were tracking Akers!

7
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,718
The records show that
Superintendent Hastings

8
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,398
is in considerable
financial difficulties.

9
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:35,118
I'd like you to carry on.

10
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,838
Very grateful, sir. Thank you, sir.

11
00:00:36,839 --> 00:00:39,158
If I was to put myself forward
for promotion,

12
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:41,839
this particular officer
more or less tipped me the wink.

13
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:47,718
'We had a deal.
Immunity from prosecution.

14
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:49,278
'You two-faced bastard.'

00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:53,499

Carly Kirk?

No ID yet.

23
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,518
Her face
and finger-pulps were burnt off.

24
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:15,278
The detective came to the house
and took the stuff you said.

25
00:01:15,279 --> 00:01:16,599
That's him.

27
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,679

Out.

31
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,318
You've been in custody.
You've been interviewed.

32
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,439
What've you told them?

33
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,919
Nothing. Christ's sake.

34
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:21,399
What have you told them? Nothing.

35
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:51,518
We know you've been
cooperating with AC-12.

36
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,558
The prison officers
burning your hands -

37
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:55,479
that didn't get the message over?

38
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,399
OK. I'm going to ask you again.
What've you told them?

39
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:02,039
Nothing.

40
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,039
Now it gets serious.

41
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:12,078
What've you told them?

42
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:13,918
D-Dryden. Speak up!

43
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,999
Mike Dryden. Set the whole thing up.

44
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,639
We're listening.

45
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:22,998
That's all I said...
That's all I said to AC-12.

46
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:25,279
Jesus Christ, Manny,
let's just do her.

47
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:32,238
I've done one female copper.
Don't think I won't do another.

48
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,519
It's the truth!

49
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:38,078
They've charged you, remanded you.
What've they got on you?

50
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,439
Dryden set me up!

51
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:42,798
Last chance.

52
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,159
It's the truth!

53
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,598
You don't recognise him?

54
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,478
Whatever. He's been a liability
ever since the e-fit came out.

55
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,439
Now get in the car! GET IN THE CAR!

56
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:17,078
You're a liability, too,
unless you start telling the truth.

57
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,598
Think about it, yeah.

58
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:19,959
GET IN!

59
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,558
Right, that's the prison officers
away. They look fine.

60
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:45,118
What about Denton? We don't know
whether she was kidnapped.

61
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:47,198
Or they were springing her
from custody.

62
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,078
'All patrols, all patrols,
repeat,

63

00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:54,718
'Denton is known to employ
misrepresentation and deceit.'

65
00:04:54,719 --> 00:04:56,558
Well, I couldn't have put it
better myself.

66
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:58,678
Right, well, get out there
and find her. Yes, sir.

67
00:04:58,679 --> 00:04:59,798
"Yes, sir." "Yes, sir."

68
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,559

'Hello, Police.'

70
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,158
This is
DS Manish Prasad, Polk Avenue Vice.

71
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:31,758
We've just sighted DI Denton.

72
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,798
DC Cole was in pursuit
but I've lost him.

73
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:36,318
'What is your location?'
I'm going after them!

74
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,359
'DS Prasad?'

75
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,078
I need an ambulance.

76
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:17,398
Yeah, sure. You pass me the phone.

77
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,558
It's in my pocket.

78
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:21,479
I'm not going to reach for it.
You want an ambulance, you pass it.

79
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,998
We'll get to the ambulance
in a minute.

80
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:40,998
First, when I turn this on,
you're going to record a statement.

81
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:45,678
Dryden, the ambush, and me.
You got it?

82
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:47,558
If I talk, I'm a dead man.

83
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:51,038
Maybe you are anyway. So talk.

84
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,638
Please. Call an ambulance.

85
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,239
Why'd they use you for the job?

86
00:06:58,039 --> 00:06:59,718
They had stuff on me and Cole.

87
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,598
He's Cole?

88
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,718
Jez - J-Jeremy Cole.

89
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:05,158
What kind of stuff?

90
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:07,158
We're Vice. Use your imagination.

91
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:08,278
And Dryden?

92
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,319
Him too.

93
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:11,919
So, there's the story.

94
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,639
That's why Dryden set up the ambush.

95
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,678
The suspect has asked me

96
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:21,558
to record what he believes
is his dying declaration

97
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:23,878
following his receiving
life-threatening injuries

98
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,598
in a road traffic collision

99
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,038
and finding himself in the hopeless
expectation of death.

100
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,518
State your name.

101
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,958
You really think you're going
to get out of this?

102
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,119
Not going to happen!

103
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,958
You killed Wallis and Butler!
Your mate killed Georgia Trotman!

104
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,639
All police, all innocent!

105
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,079
Please!

106
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,519
Now talk.

107
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:13,159
DS Manish Prasad.

108
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,438
In the hope...

109
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:19,918
hopeless expectation of death,

110
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,919

Yes, Kate. Put out obs. Sir.

OK if I check it out?

Nobody approach her,
just stay on the line!

You the nurse I was talking to? Yes.

149
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:40,238
Where is she? Last door on the left.

150
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:43,839
You hear any commotion,
you call 999 straight away. OK.

It's Steve Arnott.

153
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,919
I'd like to come in, if that's OK?

154

Lindsay, I'm coming in now.

155
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,039
I'm very sorry for your loss.

156
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:42,359
I should've been with her.

157
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,879
We can arrange for you to see her,
if that's what you want.

158
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,759
They've already stripped her room.

159
00:12:57,119 --> 00:12:58,919
Her things were very personal.

160
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,238
They mustn't lose them.

161
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:05,039
No, of course,
they've got to be returned to you.

162
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:11,999
How did you know I was here?

163
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,719
She was your mum.

164
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,039
I'll come now.

165
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,679
Take as long as you need.

166
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:35,919
I'll just be outside.

167
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,079
Thank you.

168
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,958
Well, let's hope he lives.

169
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,878
It's not whether he lives,
it's whether he'll talk.

170
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:14,038
Do you think he will? He's got to.

171
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:16,319
Chances are this arsehole's
the Caddy.

172
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:31,878
Look. I know what the crime scene
must look like.

173
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,518
What happened?

174
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,518
I was just defending myself.
I only meant to immobilise him.

175
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:37,958
You succeeded.

176
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:40,519
Don't make light of it.
It was horrible.

177
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,199
What happened to Cole?

178
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,919
Prasad murdered him.

179
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:53,239
Tell me something. Copper to copper.

180
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:55,719
Cole...

181
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:59,919
..was he definitely the one
that killed Georgia?

182
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:04,279
Yeah. He confessed.

183
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:29,678
You listened to the whole
declaration Prasad made?

184
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,759
No, not yet.

185
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,919
Dryden ordered the ambush, Steve.

186
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:37,038
With Cole and Prasad dead,

187
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:39,478
how do you propose to build
a case against Dryden?

188
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:41,038
We'll manage.

189
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,798
The fact that he's Deputy Chief
Constable - that's not an issue, no?

190
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,958
He's been accused of lying
about a driving offence

191
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,478
and it's all just melted away,

192
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,518
it's nothing to do
with him being the DCC?

193
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,519
Where's it all coming from, Steve?

194
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,599
Hastings, right?

195
00:15:56,599 --> 00:16:00,678
Every rank above DCI
is more politician than policeman.

196
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:02,878
Hastings isn't daft enough
to take Dryden on.

197
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,198
You really don't know the man.

198
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:07,038
No. I think I know you, though.

199
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,358
Do you?

200
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:12,478
Dryden ordered the killings
of four police officers

201
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:14,079
and one of them was Georgia.

202
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:55,718
Dot, Kate, come with me.

203
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:57,679
The rest of you, back to your work.

204
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:04,118
No-one present at the High Point
crime scene should enter this room

205
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,198
to prevent forensic
cross-contamination.

206
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:08,278
Is she under arrest and cautioned?

207
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:10,958
For what?
Escape from lawful custody.

208
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,038
I was kidnapped.

209
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:14,398
Yes, well, we'll let a court
determine that, shall we?

210
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:17,038
They weren't springing her, sir.
They were going to kill her.

211
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,798
Kate, will you do that, anyway?

212
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,198
Yes, sir. Mm-hm.

213
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:22,158
We'll also need your clothes
for forensics.

214
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:24,438
Nothing personal,
you understand, it's procedure.

215
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:25,798
We'll have a doctor look at you,

216
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,798
and in the meantime,
we'll take care of you.

217
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:30,678
Kate, you get a female officer
to recover her clothes, yeah. Sir.

218
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:31,998
No, no. Not you.

219
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:33,478
We want your clothes as well.

220
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:35,958
There's an audio file, sir.
You'll hear she's innocent.

221
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:37,638
Yes, and I will listen to it.

222
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,278
When you're done here,
you place her in protective custody

223
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:42,519
in a random police station
under a false ID.

224
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:47,519
Kate.

225
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,358
Lindsay Denton, you're to be charged
with escape from lawful custody.

226
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:56,439
Do you require any legal
representation at this time?

227
00:17:58,479 --> 00:17:59,559
OK.

228
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,038
'DS Manish Prasad.

229
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:22,078
'In the hope... hopeless
expectation of death,

230
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,798
'I record my dying declaration.

231
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,118
'I carried out the ambush
with DC Jeremy Cole.

232
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:31,239
'Under orders
from Deputy Chief Constable Dryden.'

233
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,119
Mother of God.

234
00:18:40,639 --> 00:18:43,078
Sorry, gaffer, I didn't think
this could wait any longer

235
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,918
now we've got the dying declaration.

236
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:47,199
You've seen these images from CCTV.

237
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:52,478
The lip-reader's analysed the tape.
Nothing incriminating, just banter.

238
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:55,958
But Dryden and Prasad
appear to be on friendly terms.

239
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:57,878
Looking at their personnel records,

240
00:18:57,879 --> 00:19:02,038
Dryden was Department Head at Vice
when Prasad joined as a DC.

241
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,558
They knew each other well, sir.

242
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,359
From the CCTV, you'd go
so far as to call them mates.

243
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:11,318
That's 15-year-old misper
Carly Kirk, also at the function.

244
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:14,078
We've contacted the catering company
and they've got no record

245
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:16,638
to say that she was
an employee of theirs that night.

246
00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:17,918
She was known to Prasad

247
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,399
and we believe this is the last time
she was seen alive.

248
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,638
Yeah, good work, very good work.
Well done.

249
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:27,039
Sir. Sir.

250
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:44,959
He said to go straight in.

251
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:51,158
Gone to ground, Ted?

252
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:53,998
My office has been asking all day
for you to report.

253
00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:57,958
Ah, you'll have to forgive me, sir,
I was just making sure of my facts.

254
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:59,439
Well, let's have them.

255
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:02,358
We've got the gunmen, sir.

256
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:06,319
One recorded confessing to the
ambush, and naming his accomplice.

257
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:10,598
Well, that's fantastic work, Ted.

258
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:12,319
I want to hear that recording.

259
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,758
All in good time, sir.

260
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:17,679
Er, this is a joint operation...

261
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,238
I will not disclose any leads to

262
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:25,039
Detective Chief Superintendent
Hargreaves, sir, and that is final.

263
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,079
Give us a minute, Les.

264
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:31,159
Les!

265
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:43,158
Do I have to drag it out of you,
Ted?

266
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,598
The two gunmen are or were
serving detectives

267
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:48,239
assigned to Vice, sir.

268
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:57,679
Well... That is a matter
of great sensitivity.

269
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,599
It's the right thing to do...
to keep a lid on it.

270
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:06,278
Who-Who were they?

271
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:08,838
I'd rather not say, sir,
I'm still gathering information.

272
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:10,678
There's those two plus Akers.

273
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:11,959
And Denton, of course.

274
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:16,718
Of course, there may be others, sir,
involved in the conspiracy,

275
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:18,439
others yet to be identified.

276
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:26,799
Well. Very good. Very good.

277
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:34,958
Being indiscreet for a moment,

278
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:38,358
you could be looking at
a promotion here, Ted...

279
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:39,639
assuming you want it.

280
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,038
It's a team effort, sir.

281
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,079
Oh, none of that false modesty.

282
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:52,118
Denise said to come straight in.

283
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,398
Absolutely.

284
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:55,958
It's a shame you can't appear
in front of camera,

285
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:58,238
but stick around
for the press conference.

286
00:21:58,239 --> 00:21:59,478
Press conference, sir?

287
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:01,078
What did I say about false modesty?

288
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:03,598
This is the breakthrough
we've been desperate for.

289
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:06,398
If you'll excuse us, Ted?

290
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:07,519
Sir.

291
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:12,478
Sorry to keep you.

292
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:13,918
Dr Kaur will see you now,

293
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,678
and then the burns specialist will
come and have a look at your hands.

294
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,998
I'll wait here.

295
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:20,199
Thanks.

296
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:33,959
Dr Kaur wants her notes downloaded.
She was seen earlier this year.

297
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:19,159
All right. All right.

298
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:23,358
You want one, sir?

299
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:26,918
Or have you packed up
now you've gone squeaky clean?

300
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:29,798
I have packed up, as it happens.

301
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:33,518
It's another thing you can act
superior about then, sir.

302
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:36,439
We're off duty, mate.
It's still "Dot".

303
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:40,479
How can I help you, sir?

304
00:23:41,639 --> 00:23:44,599
Look. It's all about information
in this game.

305
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,998
I was hoping you could help me out

306
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:51,398
with some information
about a certain Executive Officer.

307
00:23:51,399 --> 00:23:53,798
You're asking the wrong bloke.

308
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,598
Aforementioned Executive Officer

309
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:59,518
had his name splashed all over
the papers for his wife's SP30.

310
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:03,078
A paper you used to throw
the odd titbit every now and then,

311
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:04,398
if I remember right.

312
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:05,598
No comment.

313
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:06,958
Look, it's no skin off my nose

314
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:09,078
if you're making
a bit of extra holiday pay.

315
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:13,038
Perk of the job. What counts
is what happened with Dryden.

316
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,118
What really happened that night?

317
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:18,238
You're in AC five minutes, you think
it's all right to grass on your own.

318
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:20,519
Dryden - one of our own?

319
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:26,398
What... he's having posh lunches with
the PCC and shagging on expenses.

320
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:28,039
We don't owe him anything, mate.

321
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:31,398
Well, if it's a choice
between sticking it to an Exec

322
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:34,319
or sticking it to AC,
I'll have to think about it.

323
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:38,079
This is all off record.

324
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:40,838
Come on...

325
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:42,959
help me stick it
to that smug bastard.

326
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:50,158
What I heard was
it was going round wife to wife.

327
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,238
She was in a state about the SP30,
terrified about the embarrassment.

328
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:55,358
Then, all of a sudden...

329
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:59,078
it wasn't her who was driving,
it was him.

330
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:00,559
So what was he up to?

331
00:25:02,879 --> 00:25:04,438
You got it from Vice.

332
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:06,358
You never heard it from me.

333
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:07,559
Scout's honour.

334
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:11,919
He likes 'em young.

335
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,198
You got a name you can throw me
from Vice?

336
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:18,518
There is a lad. Mouthy.

337
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:19,599
Jez Cole.

338
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:22,639
Jez Cole.

339
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:25,919
Jeremy Cole?

340
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:34,878
Yeah, I've...
I've heard they call him The Caddy.

341
00:25:34,879 --> 00:25:37,158
I'll have to
take your word for that.

342
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:38,479
Will you, though?

343
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,718
What?

344
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:44,518
Look, if you think
you've got it bad, you should try AC.

345
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:46,918
The bean-counters are
all over you for everything.

346
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:48,718
But I need to get this box ticked.

347
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:52,439
All you have to do is say you've
heard this nickname used for Cole.

348
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:58,359
It'll make it easier to keep
your name out the Dryden saga.

349
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,638
I don't think the DCC'd
be best pleased

350
00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:04,319
to find out who'd splashed his name
all over the papers.

351
00:26:08,639 --> 00:26:10,079
But it won't come to that.

352
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:13,839
For old times' sake.

353
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:19,358
Apparently Cole
likes to wear golf jumpers

354
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:20,798
but he's never played the game.

355
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,959
Hence, the Caddy.

356
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:27,479
Nige?

357
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:30,279
Nice one.

358
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:57,959
How is he?

359
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,239
Stable.

360
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:06,638
When he talks, we'll know the truth.

361
00:27:06,639 --> 00:27:07,879
He's already talked.

362
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,239
Under extreme duress.

363
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:14,679
Have you told Lindsay he's alive?

364
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:17,119
No.

365
00:27:18,999 --> 00:27:20,199
Good.

366
00:27:28,639 --> 00:27:30,838
You should get off home.

367
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:32,518
I'm going to stay.

368
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:34,599
I want to be here
when he comes round.

369
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:42,158
All right. Night.

370
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,319
Night.

371
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:20,759
Steve...

372
00:28:22,479 --> 00:28:24,838
Give us a minute, will you?

373
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:26,278
Cheers.

374
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,838
I don't suppose you've got any idea

375
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,278
what it's like to be locked up
24 hours a day, have you?

376
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:33,638
I'm sorry. Hold me on
the original conspiracy charge

377
00:28:33,639 --> 00:28:36,838
but please let me
make a second bail application.

378
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:39,399
Please, Steve,
I can't be locked up any more.

379
00:29:20,639 --> 00:29:23,998
Your Honour, the defendant wishes
to make a second bail application.

380
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:25,278
I'll hear it.

381
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,478
The defendant has proved
she's not a flight risk

382
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:30,318
by willingly surrendering herself
into police custody.

383
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:33,118
She's also fully cooperating
with Anti-Corruption Unit 12

384
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:36,318
in their further inquiries into
the murders of three police officers

385
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:37,519
on the 5th September.

386
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:40,239
Ms Latimer?

387
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:46,078
Your Honour, the prosecution
no longer opposes bail

388
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:48,518
subject to the defendant
surrendering her passport

389
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:50,438
and residing at her home address,

390
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:52,758
this being monitored
by an electronic tag.

391
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:56,198
This is on the basis, Your Honour,
that the defendant

392
00:29:56,199 --> 00:29:59,679
continues to cooperate fully
with Anti-Corruption Unit 12.

393
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:06,479
From what I've heard, bail is granted
subject to these conditions.

394
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:36,198
Someone could've put the heating on.

395
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:38,838
I need a shower
and a change of clothes.

396
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:41,078
The, er... the base unit...

397
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:43,318
Yep, will alert you
if I run off into the night.

398
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:46,718
A uniformed officer will remain
outside. Is that overkill?

399
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,158
For your protection.

400
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,519
Right. Yeah. Thanks.

401
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:54,479
Great!

402
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:06,758
I don't suppose
you've got any ketchup?

403
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:09,238
Must've left it with
the pickled onions and mushy peas.

404
00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:11,399
Are you being sarcastic? A bit.

405
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,278
I've just had my fill recently

406
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:17,718
of people speaking to me
in a mean-spirited way, that's all.

407
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:18,919
Sorry.

408
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,398
What happened to the cat?

409
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:25,959
Taken to a home
when I got put on remand.

410
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,278
Will you be able to get it back?

411
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,358
Her. She's been adopted.

412
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:34,638
Sorry, I didn't mean to...
It's all right.

413
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:36,998
Probably thought it was just a cat.

414
00:31:36,999 --> 00:31:39,798
Mike was the same. He was allergic.

415
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:42,398
He said we could never move in
together if I kept a cat.

416
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,519
My previous cat. You got rid of it?

417
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:47,999
Well, I... I thought
he would move in.

418
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:52,278
You must hate him for it.

419
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:54,719
Like you said, it was just a cat.

420
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:57,398
I didn't say that.

421
00:31:57,399 --> 00:32:00,278
Well, I'm home.

422
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:02,438
I'm semi-free.

423
00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:03,758
And you got wine.

424
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:06,638
Thought after all you'd been through
it'd take the edge off.

425
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:08,079
Yeah. You thought right.

426
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:11,238
Do you want one?

427
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:12,279
Better not.

428
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:14,758
Well...

429
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:16,999
if you don't drink it, I will.

430
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:20,239
Can't jail me for that, can they?

431
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:22,679
Cheers.

432
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:37,919
Prasad's not dead.

433
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:45,079
He's in a bad way right now,
but there's every chance he'll talk.

434
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:48,879
Good.

435
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:53,758
I really better leave you
to settle in.

436
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:55,199
Thanks.

437
00:33:13,719 --> 00:33:16,678
We have on record
your dying declaration,

438
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:20,838
made when you were under
the hopeless expectation of death,

439
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:23,998
testifying to the fact that
you carried out the ambush,

440
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:26,318
in concert with DC Jeremy Cole,

441
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:29,558
and under the orders of Deputy
Chief Constable Michael Dryden.

442
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:31,598
Now, is all this true?

443
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:34,359
Whether it's true or false
is irrelevant.

444
00:33:35,439 --> 00:33:38,758
It was obtained under duress,
so it's inadmissible in court.

445
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:41,558
Well, we've got a pile of evidence
that is admissible.

446
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:44,718
Kidnap, attempted murder,

447
00:33:44,719 --> 00:33:47,158
murder, conspiracy,

448
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:48,998
perverting the course of justice,

449
00:33:48,999 --> 00:33:50,798
sexual activity with a child.

450
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,719
You are going down
for a long time, fella.

451
00:33:55,479 --> 00:33:59,278
And I'm looking at three muppets
who know I'm their best witness.

452
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,639
Jesus.

453
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:05,518
Let's talk about
this 15-year-old girl.

454
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,798
Carly Kirk.

455
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,878
We have witnesses telling us
that you were her boyfriend.

456
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:11,958
You mopped up the DNA
control samples

457
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:15,798
from her foster parents' home
so her body couldn't be identified.

458
00:34:15,799 --> 00:34:19,039
That your idea, Manish,
or was it Dryden's?

459
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,039
Did Dryden kill her?

460
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,718
I request immunity from prosecution

461
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:28,558
and enrolment in
a witness protection programme.

462
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:31,358
Look, we have you on tape
at a City Hall function

463
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:32,959
with Dryden and Carly Kirk.

464
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,398
Immunity.

465
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:40,159
What were the three of you
doing there together?

466
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:42,839
Immunity.

467
00:35:02,439 --> 00:35:05,399
Steve.
There's summat you need to see.

468
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:10,638
This was found in the boot
of Prasad's private car,

469
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:11,959
under the spare wheel.

470
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:15,758
So the night we're interested in
is the 16th August,

471
00:35:15,759 --> 00:35:17,679
the night of the driving offence.

472
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:24,318
Carly Kirk.

473
00:35:24,319 --> 00:35:26,638
He must've left
the reception with her.

474
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:28,039
Keep going.

475
00:35:32,959 --> 00:35:34,079
Got the bastard.

476
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:38,599
Open those last files.

477
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:48,838
We've got Prasad's dying declaration

478
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:51,558
it was Dryden who set up the ambush,
and now we have the motive.

479
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:52,958
These photos were also found.

480
00:35:52,959 --> 00:35:55,478
This appears to be Carly Kirk's body
before it was buried

481
00:35:55,479 --> 00:35:58,279
under the concrete floor
at the industrial unit.

482
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:06,999
Good work.

483
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:11,438
Good work, yeah.

484
00:36:11,439 --> 00:36:13,798
There's just one thing
I don't understand here.

485
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:15,398
If Prasad had these photographs,

486
00:36:15,399 --> 00:36:18,718
to my mind, that makes him part
of the effort to blackmail Dryden.

487
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,118
So what are you saying -
that he just changes sides,

488
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,318
does Dryden's bidding,
and sets up the ambush?

489
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:26,678
Well, until we get the CPS to agree
to terms on Prasad's immunity,

490
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:30,439
we're stuck. And we're stuck on
Dryden without Prasad's testimony.

491
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,838
It's too many ifs and buts.

492
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:39,078
That's why we need to fill in
the gaps with Dryden.

493
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:40,958
We're past the evidence threshold,
sir.

494
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:43,158
We can't do much more
without arresting him.

495
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,959
We would've done,
if he weren't the DCC, eh? Yeah.

496
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,158
Do it.

497
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:02,479
Sir. Sir. Sir.

498
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:27,078
What's going on?

499
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:29,158
Would you come with us, please, sir?

500
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:32,278
Where? We've made an arrangement
with East Midlands.

501
00:37:32,279 --> 00:37:36,119
Superintendent Hastings felt that
was the most sensitive way to proceed.

502
00:37:37,399 --> 00:37:39,279
Work, love. Give us a minute.

503
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,079
Please.

504
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:52,079
I'm not going to
make this easy for you.

505
00:37:54,279 --> 00:37:57,238
Michael Dryden, you're to
accompany us for questioning.

506
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:58,798
We're not arresting you at this time

507
00:37:58,799 --> 00:38:02,239
but if you do not comply,
then we will be forced to arrest you.

508
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:06,479
Get home, the pair of you.
Past your bedtime.

509
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,198
We're not going anywhere, sir,

510
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:12,359
unless you're coming with us.

511
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,238
Michael Dryden, I am arresting you.

512
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:24,158
You do not have to say anything but
it may harm your defence if you fail

513
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:26,998
to mention when questioned
something you later rely on in court.

514
00:38:26,999 --> 00:38:29,199
Anything you do say
may be used in evidence.

515
00:38:39,279 --> 00:38:41,838
Hiya. Hi.

516
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,999
Do you want a drink?
No. No, sit down, love.

517
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:54,118
Is everything OK?

518
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:55,359
Um...

519
00:38:56,759 --> 00:38:58,239
About the cruise...

520
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:01,719
I got ahead of myself.

521
00:39:03,959 --> 00:39:05,279
You got my hopes up.

522
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:08,599
Why, if you couldn't follow through?

523
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:11,959
It has to do with work.

524
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,358
I had to do the right thing.

525
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,479
Oh.

526
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:19,918
OK.

527
00:39:19,919 --> 00:39:23,118
Well, as long as YOU got
to do the right thing,

528
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,759
that's OK, then!

529
00:39:34,879 --> 00:39:36,558
Thanks to sterling work

530
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:38,998
by one of this Force's
most highly specialised units,

531
00:39:38,999 --> 00:39:41,918
the two gunmen responsible
for the 5th of September ambush

532
00:39:41,919 --> 00:39:43,278
are now in our hands.

533
00:39:43,279 --> 00:39:45,878
But this is a momentous day
for this police force,

534
00:39:45,879 --> 00:39:49,638
for the rule of law
and, most importantly,

535
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:53,639
for the grieving families
of our four fallen comrades.

536
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:48,839
Thank you.

537
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,758
The format of this interview
is the same with any other suspect.

538
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:02,278
You no longer have the right

539
00:41:02,279 --> 00:41:05,559
to be questioned by an officer
at least one rank superior.

540
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:19,518
Interview of Michael Edward Dryden
in the presence of his solicitor

541
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,879
by DS Arnott, DC Fleming.

542
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,238
May I begin, sir?

543
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:27,238
I've already been in custody
for eight hours.

544
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:30,958
Think you'd better get a move on.
Clock's ticking.

545
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:34,758
In respect of the night of 5th
September, the night of the ambush,

546
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:36,918
you received a phone call
from DI Denton.

547
00:41:36,919 --> 00:41:38,478
We've covered this.

548
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:41,398
Well, one question
requires further examination.

549
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:42,838
Prior to the call,

550
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:46,078
what was your relationship,
if any, with DI Denton?

551
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,198
Two things. One -
there was no relationship.

552
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:51,278
Two - this lies outside
the parameters of the investigation.

553
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:54,438
Well, we're at liberty to investigate
any connection to the ambush,

554
00:41:54,439 --> 00:41:56,959
its conspirators
and its alleged conspirators.

555
00:41:59,999 --> 00:42:01,719
You should answer.

556
00:42:06,279 --> 00:42:07,639
May I continue, sir?

557
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:10,238
Apparently you may.

558
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:13,758
Did you know her? Yes. We worked
together in Crime Analysis,

559
00:42:13,759 --> 00:42:16,278
a six-month posting,
about five years ago.

560
00:42:16,279 --> 00:42:18,078
DI Denton was on duty that night,

561
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,718
covering for
Inspector Joseph Barlow.

562
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:24,678
Inspector Barlow was invited by you
to attend a Crime Executive seminar.

563
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:26,798
By my office, not by me.

564
00:42:26,799 --> 00:42:28,758
The Crime Executive
meets once a month.

565
00:42:28,759 --> 00:42:32,118
We regularly invite officers
of all ranks and specialisations.

566
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:33,558
If Barlow hadn't been there,

567
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:36,638
he would've been the Duty Inspector
the night of the ambush, not Denton.

568
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:39,718
The names come up on a list.
Barlow wasn't cherry-picked.

569
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:42,798
It's a coincidence. But you accept
as a result of your invitation...

570
00:42:42,799 --> 00:42:45,599
It's a coincidence,
an unfortunate one. Move on.

571
00:42:50,399 --> 00:42:53,319
On the call from DI Denton,
you addressed her as "Linda".

572
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:55,958
Did I?

573
00:42:55,959 --> 00:42:58,639
According to Denton,
that's what you called her.

574
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,798
I don't get where
you're going with this.

575
00:43:01,799 --> 00:43:04,558
One theory would be that you were
trying to conceal to your wife

576
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:07,438
that you were receiving a call
from DI Denton. And it'd be wrong.

577
00:43:07,439 --> 00:43:10,438
According to Denton's statement,
when you worked together,

578
00:43:10,439 --> 00:43:12,998
your relationship went
beyond the purely professional.

579
00:43:12,999 --> 00:43:15,518
First half-baked theories,
now innuendo.

580
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:18,878
You must want to face
a suit for wrongful arrest.

581
00:43:18,879 --> 00:43:20,758
You deny an affair
with Lindsay Denton?

582
00:43:20,759 --> 00:43:21,918
I do.

583
00:43:21,919 --> 00:43:24,518
You deny spending nights
together at her residence,

584
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:27,118
Queens' Arms Hotel,
among other places?

585
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,639
I strenuously deny
an affair with Lindsay Denton.

586
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:35,758
An affair isn't necessarily
the same as sexual relations.

587
00:43:35,759 --> 00:43:38,719
Have you had sexual relations
with Lindsay Denton?

588
00:43:40,999 --> 00:43:43,718
I need a definition
of sexual relations.

589
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:45,239
If I may, sir.

590
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:51,198
"For the purpose of
this investigation,

591
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:54,238
"a person engages in sexual
relations when the person knowingly

592
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:58,078
"engages in, receives or causes
contact with the genitalia, anus,

593
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,198
"groin, breast, inner thigh,
or buttocks of any person

594
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:04,358
"with an intent to arouse
or gratify sexual desire.

595
00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:06,158
"Contact means intentional touching,

596
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:08,479
"either directly
or through clothing."

597
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:16,158
I shagged her a couple of times, she
was a bunny-boiler, and I moved on.

598
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:18,639
Obviously she wanted there
to be more to it.

599
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:25,958
Ma'am, if you'd kindly refer
to Document 3 in your folder,

600
00:44:25,959 --> 00:44:27,598
you'll see signed authority

601
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,679
to access your client's
telecommunication records.

602
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:34,719
I see Superintendent Hastings'
signature.

603
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,238
Sir, if you'd kindly refer
to Document 4 in your folder,

604
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:45,959
you'll see said records relating
to the 16th August of this year.

605
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,518
I see them.

606
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,878
You'll see a call was made
at 9:33pm from your mobile phone,

607
00:44:51,879 --> 00:44:54,678
lasting approximately 20 seconds.

608
00:44:54,679 --> 00:44:57,358
Do you recognise the number
receiving the call?

609
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:58,758
No.

610
00:44:58,759 --> 00:45:01,719
This mobile phone
is registered to Lindsay Denton.

611
00:45:03,279 --> 00:45:05,718
I made that call.
What was said in that call?

612
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:07,078
It was a long time ago.

613
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,758
According to Denton's statement,
you sounded distressed.

614
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:12,359
Why were you distressed?
I'm sick of her bullshit!

615
00:45:22,399 --> 00:45:25,158
I called Lindsay
because she'd been following me.

616
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:27,758
Just when I think she's got
the message, there she is again.

617
00:45:27,759 --> 00:45:29,158
Could be a week, could be a month.

618
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:31,958
But she turns up
and it starts all over again.

619
00:45:31,959 --> 00:45:33,918
You're alleging
she's a stalker, sir?

620
00:45:33,919 --> 00:45:37,038
That's exactly what I'm alleging.
She knows she can get away with it

621
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:41,038
because there is no way I'm going to
let her have her say about "us".

622
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:43,278
My wife having to listen to that.

623
00:45:43,279 --> 00:45:45,879
In what way did she
allegedly stalk you that night?

624
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,918
I'm not saying she was there
that particular night.

625
00:45:49,919 --> 00:45:52,798
I'm just saying she had a habit
of turning up and hassling me.

626
00:45:52,799 --> 00:45:54,958
You sure about that? Yes.

627
00:45:54,959 --> 00:45:57,558
Witnesses? Let me tell you
about Lindsay Denton.

628
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:00,478
She's too smart to
let there be witnesses.

629
00:46:00,479 --> 00:46:03,198
She gets your phone records,
DC Fleming.

630
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:06,318
Superintendent Hastings,
she gets his financial records.

631
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,878
DS Arnott, she followed you,
took compromising photos.

632
00:46:08,879 --> 00:46:11,359
Did you see her?
Were there any witnesses?

633
00:46:13,159 --> 00:46:17,278
You want to watch her.
She's manipulative and conniving.

634
00:46:17,279 --> 00:46:19,239
You can't trust a word she says.

635
00:46:27,919 --> 00:46:29,319
Can we be clear?

636
00:46:30,679 --> 00:46:32,998
You accept
the phone record is accurate?

637
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:34,479
As I've said.

638
00:46:35,799 --> 00:46:39,519
I'd be grateful, sir, if you'd refer
to Document 8 in your folder.

639
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,238
Document 8 is a transcript
of part of a previous interview

640
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:48,398
your client gave us
under Regulation 15 Notice.

641
00:46:48,399 --> 00:46:50,879
A complaint was made
regarding an SP30.

642
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:56,878
A vehicle registered to Mrs Helen
Dryden was flashed by a speed camera

643
00:46:56,879 --> 00:47:00,519
and a week later Traffic received
notice that you were driving.

644
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:06,278
From the transcript - "DCC DRYDEN:
I was driving. Helen was home.

645
00:47:06,279 --> 00:47:08,758
"I drove back towards town
to buy some beer and wine

646
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:12,318
"from the off-licence.
I changed my mind and went home."

647
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:15,678
Said offence took place on
the evening of the 16th of August.

648
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:19,318
Your mobile phone record places you
miles away from the speed camera,

649
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:22,118
making a call to DI Lindsay Denton.

650
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:24,558
You weren't driving that car.

651
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,798
It says so...

652
00:47:26,799 --> 00:47:28,079
here.

653
00:47:39,879 --> 00:47:43,159
Virtually my whole marriage,
I've worked long hours.

654
00:47:44,999 --> 00:47:46,479
It's taken a toll.

655
00:47:50,919 --> 00:47:54,279
That night,
Helen was at an AA meeting.

656
00:47:56,359 --> 00:47:58,158
She was worried it would get out

657
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:00,998
if the speeding charge
was taken further.

658
00:48:00,999 --> 00:48:03,318
She made out I was driving
and posted the form.

659
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:05,398
By the time she told me,
it was too late.

660
00:48:05,399 --> 00:48:07,238
I hoped no-one would ever find out

661
00:48:07,239 --> 00:48:09,999
but some arsehole
leaked it all over the papers.

662
00:48:14,439 --> 00:48:16,678
She was ashamed...

663
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:18,679
she was attending those meetings.

664
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:24,478
I'm the one that should be ashamed.

665
00:48:24,479 --> 00:48:25,838
We have information

666
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:28,639
that your wife had confided
her driving offence to friends.

667
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:33,998
She had a clean licence,
no chance of being banned.

668
00:48:33,999 --> 00:48:37,998
We don't think that was a good
enough reason for her to lie.

669
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:40,998
The only reason would be
to provide you with an alibi,

670
00:48:40,999 --> 00:48:43,799
or for you to seize the opportunity
to create one.

671
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,838
I didn't fill in that form.

672
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:50,238
If I happen to know
it was my wife that did so,

673
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:52,758
I have no intention
of testifying against her.

674
00:48:52,759 --> 00:48:54,278
The lawyers'll have a field day.

675
00:48:54,279 --> 00:48:57,318
The real villain in all this is
whatever toerag leaked that story,

676
00:48:57,319 --> 00:49:00,158
to bring me down because
the politicians and the PCC

677
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:03,279
don't like me telling the truth
about service cutbacks.

678
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,718
Why are you talking about
service cutbacks, sir?

679
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:09,718
I'm trying to get you to
open your eyes, son. They're open.

680
00:49:09,719 --> 00:49:12,918
If you weren't driving your wife's
car, what were you doing that night?

681
00:49:12,919 --> 00:49:15,598
I've answered your questions.
We're done here. We're not.

682
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:17,558
Where were you that night?
No comment.

683
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:19,159
Document 10.

684
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:22,478
Here's a map showing
the mobile phone cell

685
00:49:22,479 --> 00:49:24,718
from which your call
originated that evening.

686
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:26,318
Please specify your location.

687
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:28,678
No comment. You were out
in the Edge Park area. Why?

688
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:29,878
No comment.

689
00:49:29,879 --> 00:49:31,998
DS Manish Prasad and DC Jeremy Cole

690
00:49:31,999 --> 00:49:34,238
carried out the ambush
on September 5th.

691
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:36,078
Were you meeting with them?

692
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:37,998
What is this? Are you insane?

693
00:49:37,999 --> 00:49:40,918
Look in your folder. Document 11.

694
00:49:40,919 --> 00:49:43,358
Evidence log
from DCS Hargreaves' team,

695
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:46,598
re the vehicle used
by DS Jayne Akers during the ambush.

696
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:51,518
Item 14 - mobile magnetic radio
tracking device.

697
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:54,838
There was a lump on Akers' vehicle
that allowed the gunmen to track her.

698
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:57,198
This evidence
was withheld from AC-12.

699
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:00,598
You knew about this but let us make
a case against Lindsay Denton regardless.

700
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:03,158
Why did you withhold the evidence?

701
00:50:03,159 --> 00:50:05,318
The investigations
were separate at the time.

702
00:50:05,319 --> 00:50:06,678
It felt like the right way to go.

703
00:50:06,679 --> 00:50:09,318
I didn't keep track of every
little piece of evidence myself.

704
00:50:09,319 --> 00:50:12,398
You were happy for your alleged
stalker to be charged and remanded,

705
00:50:12,399 --> 00:50:15,158
to take the blame for something
she didn't do. You set her up.

706
00:50:15,159 --> 00:50:17,758
She's the one out for revenge!
She's the one out to get me!

707
00:50:17,759 --> 00:50:19,798
She's using you all
and you've fallen for it!

708
00:50:19,799 --> 00:50:21,398
Where were you that night?

709
00:50:21,399 --> 00:50:24,718
Don't go down this road, son.
It doesn't end well.

710
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:26,718
You got the balls to charge me?

711
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:28,358
Tick-tock.

712
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:32,398
As you know, sir, you can be held
in custody for a maximum of 36 hours,

713
00:50:32,399 --> 00:50:35,478
after which you'll either
be charged or released.

714
00:50:35,479 --> 00:50:39,399
We thank you for your cooperation and
we intend to continue. Document 13.

715
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:45,199
Document 13.

716
00:50:48,399 --> 00:50:51,238
This is a transcript from
a statement you gave to the press

717
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:55,518
on August 9th. In it, you expressed
disapproval for, in your words,

718
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:56,878
"repugnant offenders"

719
00:50:56,879 --> 00:50:59,678
who should have their immunity
from prosecution taken away.

720
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:03,558
One such offender being
John Thomas Hunter, aka Tommy Hunter,

721
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:05,398
the protected witness.

722
00:51:05,399 --> 00:51:09,798
We have Hunter on tape, stating
his intention to blackmail you.

723
00:51:09,799 --> 00:51:13,118
For the tape, I'm presenting
the suspect with photographs

724
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:17,599
entered in evidence,
evidence number H86734-D.

725
00:51:30,279 --> 00:51:32,879
Do you recognise
the male in this photograph?

726
00:51:36,759 --> 00:51:38,478
It's... me.

727
00:51:38,479 --> 00:51:39,838
Speak up for the tape.

728
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,038
It's me. And the girl?

729
00:51:42,039 --> 00:51:43,159
Don't know.

730
00:51:44,359 --> 00:51:47,758
For the tape, I'm presenting
the suspect with photographs entered

731
00:51:47,759 --> 00:51:53,479
in evidence, evidence numbers
H86734 dash A to C, dash E to K.

732
00:52:05,799 --> 00:52:07,399
That's you and the female?

733
00:52:08,399 --> 00:52:09,559
Plainly.

734
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:15,039
What's happening
in these photographs?

735
00:52:19,279 --> 00:52:20,798
Who's the girl?

736
00:52:20,799 --> 00:52:22,198
I don't know.

737
00:52:22,199 --> 00:52:25,158
You appear to know her well enough
in these photos. Appear to.

738
00:52:25,159 --> 00:52:27,278
This is Carly Kirk.

739
00:52:27,279 --> 00:52:29,918
She was seen working
as part of the catering team

740
00:52:29,919 --> 00:52:32,959
at the reception at City Hall
on the 16th of August.

741
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:35,999
Carly Kirk is 15 years old.

742
00:52:41,879 --> 00:52:43,159
I...

743
00:52:45,799 --> 00:52:47,319
No, um...

744
00:52:48,959 --> 00:52:50,958
She looked older.

745
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,559
How old? 18?

746
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:03,038
Carly Kirk was a vulnerable young
girl groomed by DS Manish Prasad.

747
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:05,918
You worked with Prasad in Vice.

748
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:07,239
Here you are together.

749
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:11,158
Did Prasad provide you
with young women for sex?

750
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:12,758
Absolutely not.

751
00:53:12,759 --> 00:53:14,199
Maybe not.

752
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:17,719
But he knew what you liked.

753
00:53:22,839 --> 00:53:25,838
Did an offence take place
between you and Carly Kirk,

754
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:29,718
namely sexual activity with a child
under the Sexual Offences Act 2003?

755
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:33,438
It's not what it looks like.
She never got started. I...

756
00:53:33,439 --> 00:53:35,238
I came to my senses.

757
00:53:35,239 --> 00:53:37,678
Well, why did you let it
get that far?

758
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:39,158
Why do you think?

759
00:53:39,159 --> 00:53:41,999
Well, I'm not an old perv,
so you'll have to tell me.

760
00:53:43,439 --> 00:53:46,678
I was tempted. For a moment.

761
00:53:46,679 --> 00:53:48,598
And then I chucked her
out of the car.

762
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:52,878
We believe these photos were used by
John Thomas Hunter to blackmail you.

763
00:53:52,879 --> 00:53:55,358
John Thomas Hunter was
the target of the ambush.

764
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:56,638
Did you set up the ambush? No!

765
00:53:56,639 --> 00:53:59,438
I never even knew about Hunter,
I never knew about this blackmail!

766
00:53:59,439 --> 00:54:01,638
You turned the tables on Hunter,
had him silenced.

767
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:04,318
That is not something I would do.
I'm not a criminal.

768
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,998
Well, according to
these photographs, you are.

769
00:54:06,999 --> 00:54:09,599
What does the girl say
is happening in these photos?

770
00:54:12,439 --> 00:54:13,879
What?

771
00:54:15,439 --> 00:54:16,478
For the tape,

772
00:54:16,479 --> 00:54:20,999
I'm presenting the suspect with
photographs H86734 dash L to P.

773
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:45,118
The point is who she was last
seen with before she disappeared.

774
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:46,558
Now, wait...

775
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,038
She was murdered.
Do you know who murdered her?

776
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:50,398
No. Did you murder her? No!

777
00:54:50,399 --> 00:54:52,758
She was strangled.
Do you know who strangled her? No.

778
00:54:52,759 --> 00:54:54,998
Did you strangle her? No.
Her teeth were ripped out.

779
00:54:54,999 --> 00:54:56,758
Her face and finger-pulps
were burnt off

780
00:54:56,759 --> 00:54:58,438
using a high temperature blow-torch.

781
00:54:58,439 --> 00:55:00,198
Do you know who did that to her? No.

782
00:55:00,199 --> 00:55:01,919
Did you do that to her? No!

783
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:13,158
While you've been in custody, there's
been a search of your residence

784
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:17,718
and vehicle under Section 18 (1) of
the Police and Criminal Evidence Act.

785
00:55:17,719 --> 00:55:20,638
Our people were trying to find
clothes that you were wearing

786
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:22,999
in these photographs.
Why didn't they find any?

787
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:27,558
I-I don't know. Because you
purposefully disposed of them

788
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:30,639
to remove any trace of
this girl's DNA and clothes fibres.

789
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,438
I...I must've, um...

790
00:55:34,439 --> 00:55:37,438
I must've had a clear-out
and given them to the charity shop.

791
00:55:37,439 --> 00:55:40,318
Same with your vehicle.
A check round local businesses

792
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:43,559
reveals you had the car valeted
the very next day. Steam-cleaned.

793
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:47,678
I didn't want my wife
finding anything...

794
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:49,638
smelling the girl's cheap perfume.

795
00:55:49,639 --> 00:55:52,798
So you admit taking measures to
conceal evidence you were with her.

796
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:56,079
Because I got how incriminating
it would be. Funny, that.

797
00:55:57,639 --> 00:56:01,519
You were the last person to see
Carly Kirk before she disappeared.

798
00:56:02,879 --> 00:56:04,478
The last person to see a girl

799
00:56:04,479 --> 00:56:07,558
who's later found buried
under the industrial unit.

800
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:10,718
There's no evidence I did it.
Look at these photos!

801
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:13,838
You had Tommy killed to silence him
and you needed to kill Carly, too.

802
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:16,318
You've got nothing connecting me
to the body. Nothing.

803
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:17,598
Your career is over, sir.

804
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:19,918
Possibly your marriage, too.
Why keep up the lies?

805
00:56:19,919 --> 00:56:23,038
I'm not a criminal. I'm an honest
man! You instigated a conspiracy

806
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:25,238
that led to the deaths
of four police officers.

807
00:56:25,239 --> 00:56:27,519
The only conspiracy is against me!

808
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:33,158
Hastings! I know you're out there.
You're behind this.

809
00:56:33,159 --> 00:56:35,158
Did they bribe you?

810
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:38,478
Get you out a mess
you made for yourself?

811
00:56:38,479 --> 00:56:41,438
Hell, that's all going to come out!

812
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:43,358
You're finished!

813
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:44,959
YOU'RE FINISHED!

814
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:49,319
Empty threat, sir.

815
00:56:51,719 --> 00:56:54,318
Michael Edward Dryden,

816
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:57,238
I hereby inform you that
the senior investigating officer

817
00:56:57,239 --> 00:57:00,078
Superintendent Hastings will be
submitting your case file

818
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:02,918
to the Crown Prosecutor
for the purpose of seeking authority

819
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:05,198
to charge you with
the following offences -

820
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:07,998
murder, conspiracy to murder,

821
00:57:07,999 --> 00:57:12,438
perverting the course of justice,
sexual activity with a child.

822
00:57:12,439 --> 00:57:13,879
I'm innocent.

823
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:17,399
Someone is setting me up.

824
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:24,359
Interview terminated.

825
00:57:31,799 --> 00:57:34,479
DI Denton's medical records.
Thank you.

826
00:57:36,999 --> 00:57:38,878
Heads up, you lot.

Deputy Chief Constable Mike Dryden.'

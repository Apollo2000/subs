1
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,810
There's been
an attack on the police.

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,100
Three of our colleagues have lost
their lives in the line of duty.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,210
The vehicles travelled along
Crown Avenue and then turned left

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,820
into Long Lane, almost immediately
after which the ambush took place.

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,050
Akers chose the route? Yeah.

6
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,050
The third victim's name is being
withheld from the public

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,380
because she was from Witness
Protection - DS Jayne Akers.

8
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,660
Do you think she ever knew?

9
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,690
CRASH!

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,970
Your vehicle was the only one
that wasn't shot at.

11
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,300
No firearms, no backup.

12
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,860
No firearms, no backup.

13
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,650
A breakthrough is imminent.

14

15
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,370
Computer on the blink?

16
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,930
I'm an old-fashioned girl.

17
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,530
I'm heading up a newly-formed unit
that's taken over

18
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,410
the search for Carly.

19
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,010
That's my new DC, Kate Foster.

20
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,100
Hi.

21
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,210
Denton just made a call
to the hospital from a payphone.

22
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,540
Get over there, Steve.
Check on the witness.

23
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,410
'The police officer
plunged five floors

24
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,450
'and is reported to have died
instantly.

25
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,450
'She has been named as Detective
Constable Georgia Trotman, aged 28.

26
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,850
'A police spokesperson refused to
disclose the precise

27
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,810
'circumstances surrounding
Detective Constable Trotman's death,

28
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,970
'however, a murder enquiry
has been opened and officers

29
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,970
'are seeking a suspect in connection
with the investigation.'

30
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,170
The witness is dead. Jesus wept!

31
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,450
They've brought someone in -
copper.

32
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,170
DCS Hargreaves, DS Rogerson,
Major Violent Crime Unit.

33
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,180
I'm very sorry about DC Trotman.
Thank you.

34
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,570
We're interested in what you were
up to at the hospital.

35
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,740
There on a tip-off, weren't you?

36
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,330
If you speak
to Superintendent Hastings...

37
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,810
Where did that tip-off come from,
eh?

38
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,330
Who's got that
kind of inside information?

39
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,770
I do honestly want to help, sir,

40
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,540
but I'm really not at liberty
to answer that question.

41
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,090
Your partner fell five floors.

42
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:13,330
The pathologist had to spoon half
her brain back inside her skull.

43
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,620
Do you not want to help us
get the bastard that did it?

44
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,970
There were two of you, weren't there,
eh?

45
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,300
Two of you. One of him.

46
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,090
Sit down.

47
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,570
You're going nowhere till I've got
corroboration you were

48
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,100
there on lawful business.

49
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,820
You know a Lorna Barrett?

50
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,650
Of her.
She's my next-door neighbour, sir.

51
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,490
Professional Standards are serving
you a Reg 15.

52
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,090
Ms Barrett's c/o'd assault
occasioning ABH.

53
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,900
You struck her with a bottle,
beat her head against the floor.

54
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,940
May I, sir?

55
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,460
DC Foster.

56
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,090
What are you playing at?

57
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,340
I'd just feel more comfortable
with a witness, sir.

58
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,620
Sir. Ma'am.

59
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,100
Would you mind repeating
what you just said, sir?

60
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,210
Lorna Barrett alleges you
struck her with a bottle

61
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,970
and alleges you beat
her head against the floor.

62
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,930
Ms Barrett is an alcoholic with
a long history of mental illness.

63
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,020
It's very sad.

64
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,490
You deny the charges?

65
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:57,610
An officer gets accused, falsely,
and the vultures start circling.

66
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,450
I'm just not going to take it, sir.

67
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,530
I'm going to clear my name, even if

68
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,020
it means dragging the lot of you
through the courts.

69
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,340
You're already under
investigation by AC-12.

70
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,940
If Standards have got any sense,
they'll make it their problem.

71
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,020
Steve, you're fine. Come on.

72
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,530
Could I have a word with you,
please?

73
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,100
Here...if you want to go
down that road.

74
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,850
Your treatment of my officer was
unsympathetic and provocative.

75
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,250
As a matter of policy,
Anti-Corruption cannot discuss

76
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,050
the details of any ongoing
investigation, as you well know.

77
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,930
Yeah, well, you have it your way,
eh?

78
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,010
Leave real policing to the experts.

79
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,100
Experts?

80
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,820
Would that be your guard
unit you're referring to, sir?

81
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,050
Are you all right? How's your head?
Do you need to see the doctor?

82
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,580
I'm fine.
What happened to the guards?

83
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:16,530
They got locked out on a disused
fire escape chasing an intruder -

84
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,890
thought they could make their way
back to their posts

85
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,050
before anybody noticed.

86
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,450
Pair of bloody idiots
got Georgia killed.

87
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,180
You can be very proud
of your daughter.

88
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,890
She was a dedicated young officer
who gave her life

89
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,660
trying to protect the public.

90
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,860
If there's anything I can do,
just call on me at any time.

91
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,980
Let me, let me.

92
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,460
I promise you,
we'll find the people who did it.

93
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,860
So...I'm here.

94
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,540
Thank you.

95
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,500
Well, why the mystery?

96
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,780
We lost Georgia.

97
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,090
The girl we had dinner with?

98
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,180
Oh, my God, Ted, I'm so sorry.

99
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,020
Is there anything I can do?

100
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,610
Don't.

101
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,900
Don't use the poor girl's
death to diminish what you did.

102
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,380
If you're sending flowers,
make them from me too.

103
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,890
You. I could sue your arse.

104
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,890
If we could try to get along like
grown-ups, maybe you could understand

105
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,060
that it would help if you didn't play
your music so loudly at night.

106
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,580
Well, if it helps you,
how about you help me?

107
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,930
Hundred.

108
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,090
I'm not giving you money.

109
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,220
A hundred and I keep it down.

110
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,860
Ten.

111
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,500
Fine.

112
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,690
Michelle? I'm DI Denton. Is there
somewhere quiet we can talk?

113
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,210
Carly's foster parents thought
she might've been with you

114
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,450
the night she disappeared.

115
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,890
In your original statement,
you referred to a boyfriend?

116
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,250
I don't know if he was.

117
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,650
She started hanging out less and
it was like maybe he was the reason.

118
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,490
In your statement, you said you
didn't remember his name.

119
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,170
I think it was Matt or something.

120
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,170
But the policewoman said
if I couldn't be sure,

121
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,570
not to put it in the statement.

122
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,690
And what else do you
remember about him?

123
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,170
Asian...

124
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,450
fit...

125
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,530
older.

126
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,570
How old?

127
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,490
Dunno, 30?

128
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,690
After Carly disappeared, did her
boyfriend ever come looking for her?

129
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,140
No.

130
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,010
Maybe he didn't come looking for her

131
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,850
because he was in on her
disappearance?

132
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,340
I want to go and see Carly's
foster parents again. OK.

133
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,330
What's the address again?

134
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,420
Erm, Queen Street.

135
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,380
FC1 4RC.

136
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,410
I've been trying to find
the right time,

137
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,930
but there never seems to be one.

138
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,500
I'd rather not talk about that.

139
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,210
People talk, that's all.
Round the station.

140
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,770
Well, they shouldn't.

141
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,940
Yes, ma'am.

142
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,690
Sorry, ma'am, I don't mean to
badger you, it's just...

143
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,370
well, you were the one who made
the point of calling me in

144
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,370
to witness the meeting
with Mallick. True.

145
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:56,090
In which case, it might help if you
gave me the gen on your neighbour.

146
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,180
She's lying.

147
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,210
If you're worried about a charge,
though, I could say I was there,

148
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,290
just to back up
your version of events.

149
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,260
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

150
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,140
Hi.

151
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,140
Hi, I'm Detective Sergeant Steve
Arnott. We spoke at the hospital.

152
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,580
Can I come in?

153
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,410
I know you had a very long
interview with my colleagues

154
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,970
on the Major Violent Crime Unit, so
I'll keep this as brief as possible.

155
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,010
I want to start with the two
firearms officers who were

156
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,450
assigned to protect the witness.

157
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,970
Why weren't they at their post?

158
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,370
Because of Joe - sorry,
that's the only name I've got.

159
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,610
How?

160
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,290
He was dressed in scrubs
and he told them

161
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,890
he thought he'd seen someone
out on the fire escape with a gun.

162
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,290
As soon as they stepped out to
check, he locked the door.

163
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,370
How'd he got onto
the intensive care unit

164
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,220
and passed himself off as a nurse?

165
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,580
I... I gave him access.

166
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,410
How do you know Joe?

167
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,570
Um, a couple of days earlier,

168
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,050
he bumped into my car
in the hospital car park.

169
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,850
He was very apologetic.

170
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,490
He offered to pay for the repairs
at his mate's garage,

171
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,730
so I wouldn't have to
wait for the insurance.

172
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,580
So, tell me how Joe involved you.

173
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,570
We took my car at his mate's garage,
and then he gave me a lift home.

174
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,730
Then the next morning,
he called round

175
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,610
so we could drop Nathan at nursery.

176
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,370
But instead of going to
collect my car,

177
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,660
Joe said we were going
to the hospital.

178
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,210
He said...

179
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,010
He said he knew people
who would kill Nathan

180
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,170
unless I did what
they needed me to do.

181
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,530
I know I should've told someone
so they could stop him,

182
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,290
but I was too scared.

183
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,450
Joe said they'd already
killed police,

184
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,420
so not even they could protect me.

185
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,940
It's all right.

186
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,370
Around the time of the killing,
there was a call to the hospital.

187
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,250
Do you know or have you ever had
any contact with a police officer

188
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,340
named Detective Inspector
Lindsay Denton?

189
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,050
No.

190
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,050
You're sure?
Detective Inspector Lindsay Denton.

191
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,140
Definite.

192
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,090
Was she the one?

193
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,570
The one?

194
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,140
Who got killed?

195
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,860
No.

196
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,970
You OK? Fine.

197
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,610
What were Denton's movements
while we were at the hospital?

198
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,050
She made the call,
then visited her mum's nursing home.

199
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,930
I checked it out and she stayed with
her mum for exactly half an hour.

200
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,610
The exact time of the killing.

201
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,570
Perfect alibi -
plus using the phone box.

202
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,490
Yeah, well, I checked out the trace.
Now, the timing matches exactly

203
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,370
with an outside call that was
connected to the reception desk

204
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,970
on the intensive care unit -
a female voice, same time.

205
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,010
Had to be Denton.

206
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,730
The caller insisted they page
the nurse, but they wouldn't

207
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,420
because she wouldn't give a name.

208
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,770
I didn't know Georgia.
She seemed nice.

209
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,060
Yeah.

210
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,660
Mate, if you ever need to talk...
Cheers.

211
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,460
Same.

212
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,210
Right. 'Night.

213
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,300
'Night.

214
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,050
This is an e-fit of the suspect.

215
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,170
We put that together with
the nurse there.

216
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,410
Be great
if we could circulate to the press.

217
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,650
Absolutely.
I want those guards disciplined.

218
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,740
Sir.

219
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,850
This can't bloody get out.

220
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,260
The witness was close to
regaining consciousness!

221
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,660
It's very disappointing, sir.

222
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,330
Our best lead.

223
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,700
Sir.

224
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,970
So where are you with the vehicle?

225
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,170
The ambush vehicle?

226
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,530
Yes, the ambush vehicle.

227
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,770
There's no forensics to connect
it to the gunmen.

228
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,970
Since we can't trace them
via the vehicle,

229
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,970
we've been concentrating
on traffic cams,

230
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,090
trying to plot the route that it took
that night, but so far we've...

231
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,180
Nothing.

232
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,780
Right.

233
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,930
You all right to hang
around for a couple of secs, Les?

234
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,820
Jo's got an idea
she wants to go over with you.

235
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,940
All right, sir.

236
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,980
What idea?

237
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,490
From now on,
Les does the press conferences.

238
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,890
And this is my idea?

239
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,570
Obviously, if there are any
major breakthroughs,

240
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,340
I'll step back up to the plate.

241
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,530
So when would it be possible
to schedule a meeting with

242
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,290
Deputy Chief Constable Dryden?
'His diary's full for the week.'

243
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:25,210
Yeah... I appreciate he's got
a hectic round of media appoint...

244
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,450
'I can go back to him.

245
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,130
'Did you say you were
Superintendent Hayman?'

246
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,450
No, no, Hastings, like the battle.

247
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,010
'Leave it with me, sir.'

248
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,020
Thank you kindly.

249
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,610
Cab for Jo Dwyer?
Hillside Lane Station, please.

250
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,690
Hi, Jo. Pleased to meet you.
I'm Lindsay Denton.

251
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,170
I know who you are
and I'm already late for a meeting.

252
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,770
I'm so sorry, I know you must be
rushed off your feet, but this,

253
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,370
it won't take a minute of your time.

254
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,570
You must get so many calls and
e-mails... I'm sorry.

255
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,490
I should've replied.
It's been a busy time.

256
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,450
It's about publicising
the disappearance

257
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,890
of a teenage girl, Carly Kirk.

258
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,490
I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.

259
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,730
You're avoiding me. No.

260
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,690
I'm a serving Missing Persons
detective

261
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,050
and I intend to discharge my duties
until someone tells me otherwise.

262
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,090
Of course.

263
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,810
Well, then help me find this girl.

264
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,540
OK.

265
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,420
Why are you lying to me?

266
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,530
We didn't really meet
properly before - Nicky Rogerson.

267
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,210
Sorry about my boss's questioning.
He's under a lot of pressure.

268
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,610
At least he spared me
the strip search.

269
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,090
What's going on?

270
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,210
A&B Carriage Repairs was a legit
business, moved on over a year ago.

271
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,970
Unit's been vacant ever since.

272
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,570
What became of the nurse's car?

273
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,410
Found dumped. It's being checked
over for forensics.

274
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,610
Found any? Nothing.
Nothing here either.

275
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,340
We're locking it down and
moving out.

276
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,980
Hargreaves calls you "Jolly".

277
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,810
"Jolly" Rogerson.

278
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,100
He's a laugh a minute.

279
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,010
By the looks, it's not been touched
since they moved out.

280
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,210
Apparently.

281
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,660
You checked CCTV
from the hospital car park?

282
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,900
Maybe.

283
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,500
Any chance of AC-12 getting a peek?

284
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,860
Nurse's car.

285
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,060
Joe's car.

286
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,380
No accident. Mm.

287
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,050
He never once turns round
so the camera can see him.

288
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,490
That's cos he knows it's there.

289
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,290
You get a trace on that car?

290
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,980
Same story as the ambush -
stolen vehicle, cloned plates.

291
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,570
He's the go-between - you get him,
you get the killers,

292
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,420
you get the police officer
they're working with.

293
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,330
You never saw
a face in the hospital?

294
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,540
No.

295
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,980
Only Georgia did.

296
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,930
Boss, we've had a call off Carly's
mate, Michelle.

297
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,250
She remembered
something about the boyfriend.

298
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,130
Said he was into cars,
might've been a mechanic. OK.

299
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,100
Er, just give me a minute.

300
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,580
We're all set to meet the press.

301
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,780
Come with me a minute.

302
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,940
Take a seat.

303
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,770
Er...

304
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,060
What's wrong?

305
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,410
Have they found a body? No. No.

306
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,170
But unfortunately there isn't going
to be a press conference.

307
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,260
Why not?

308
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,020
There's...insufficient
interest in the story.

309
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,530
I get it.

310
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,690
Carly's just some
nothing from a broken home.

311
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,220
I'm so sorry.

312
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,650
But no-one's giving up on Carly.
This is your job!

313
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,650
Tess... Look, this is your job!

314
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:38,490
You get them to be here, you get
them to ask people to find Carly.

315
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,610
Tess.

316
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,490
She's upset, DI Denton.
We know it's not your fault. No?

317
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,980
Whose is it, then?

318
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,620
What did you tell him? Working late?

319
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,170
Yeah, something like that.

320
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,260
He believes you?

321
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,620
Kate...?

322
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,570
Are they any nearer to finding out
what happened to Jayne?

323
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,770
I think so.

324
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,060
And?

325
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,610
There's a prime suspect.

326
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,490
Sounds like there's a doubt.

327
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,660
There won't be.

328
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,050
'This is an e-fit of a suspect
strongly linked to the ambush.

329
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,250
'He used the name Joe.'

330
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,740
'So there was a connection with
the incident at the hospital?'

331
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,490
'I, er... No, erm, I...'

332
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,250
' "No" there wasn't an individual

333
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,450

334
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,540

wasn't involved in an incident?'

335
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,650
'As I say, I'm not at liberty
to confirm any connection.'

336
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,650
'Would Deputy Chief Constable Dryden

337
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,770
'be at liberty to confirm
a connection?'

338
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:25,650
'I'm constantly in touch
with the Deputy Chief Constable.'

339
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,050
'But not right now.'

'This is a complicated operation

00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,140
'working around the clock...'

342
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,770
Peace offering.

343
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,810
Kate, that's really not necessary.

344
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,330
Listen, boss, I screwed up.
This is an important posting for me.

345
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,820
I was too eager to please.

346
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,300
Thanks.

347
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,090
You're gorgeous, aren't you?
Yes, you are.

348
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,090
Yes, you are.

349
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,570
She's a little princess, I bet.

350
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,490
Aren't they all?

351
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,770
I bet you get your own way,
don't you?

352
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,530
I bet you do.

353
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,690
Lived here long?

354
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,850
A year. No, it's probably closer
to 18 months.

355
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,530
Easy to lose track.

356
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,930
This place is very cosy.

357
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,530
I had somewhere...

358
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,820
I just...had to downsize.

359
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,930
I'm sorry, boss,
I'm probably interrupting something.

360
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,140
I'm not sparkling company.
I've got a lot on my plate.

361
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,340
Thanks for the wine.
It was a nice thought.

362
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,530
Why don't I go and have a word?
No, um, please don't.

363
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,010
A couple of minutes,
she always turns it down.

364
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,650
OK.

365
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,250
And you were right, ma'am,
that people shouldn't talk.

366
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:10,170
Problem is, they do, and no-one's
getting to hear your side.

367
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,450
AC-12, they twist everything
and make everyone look guilty.

368
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,740
I wouldn't have taken this posting
if I thought you were.

369
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,050
There's an interesting exercise.

370
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,850
You take the worst thing
you've ever done,

371
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,170
and you state
it in the simplest terms -

372
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,370
no dressing it up,
no implicit mitigation.

373
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,850
I wouldn't want to play that game.

374
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,300
No, me neither, but AC-12 do.

375
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,460
What's the worst thing
you've ever done to anyone?

376
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,180
Have you done something, boss?

377
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,540
Yours first.

378
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,610
Erm...someone told a lie to help
a dead man's family,

379
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,380
and I didn't stand up for the truth.

380
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,100
No.

381
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,140
You've done worse than that.

382
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,170
We'll work well together

383
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,980
only when you can be
completely honest with me.

384
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,820
I'll let you get some rest.

385
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:27,820
Phone and financial record requests.
I just need your signature, sir.

386
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,490
Phone and financial record requests.

387
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,090
I've just got
the tick from the Chief Super.

388
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,300
I'm the Case Officer,
so returns for my eyes only, please.

389
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,250
Jo, come through. Thanks, Denise.

390
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,340
Two minutes, Ted.

391
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,290
What do they know,
or think they know?

392
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,170
They've got a source claiming
that a vehicle registered

393
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,010
to your wife was captured
by a safety camera

394
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,050
around 10pm on August 16th.

395
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,770
A fixed three-point penalty notice
was sent to your wife

396
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,810
and it's alleged she claimed,
falsely, that you were the driver.

397
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,730
How the hell did they get that?
I told you. They've got a source.

398
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,570
What, some bobby
with an axe to grind

399
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,890
fancies stabbing me
in the back for a few quid?

400
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,930
Don't these idiots realise
I'm trying to improve their lot?

401
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,020
But is it true?

402
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,570
Helen was home. I was driving.

403
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,290
I'll throw your denial
straight back at them.

404
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,450
Thank you.

405
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,420
But if they're confident of their
source, they'll run it anyway.

406
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,610
What can you do to...
limit the damage?

407
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,010
Me?

408
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,530
You.

409
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,130
The ambush is still
the bigger story.

410
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:58,020
Crack the case and the speed camera
won't even make page eight.

411
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,730
Why are they doing this to me?

412
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,820
You have to ask? Seriously?

413
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,940
Ted. Very sorry.

414
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:26,010
Have you been offered tea, coffee?

415
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,060
Ah, plenty, plenty. Thank you, sir.

416
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,770
I can see you're busy, so I'll come
straight to the point, if I may.

417
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,410
I'd be grateful.

418
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,090
AC-12 would like to access all areas

419
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,650
relevant to
the 5th September ambush.

420
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,970
Those areas being?
Witness Protection.

421
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,130
Ted... With no reciprocity.

422
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:45,370
You know the sensitivity of WP.

423
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,610
It's prudent to compartmentalise
the investigation.

424
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,540
And how is that going, sir?

425
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:56,370
I'm only interested in
the best way to get results, Ted.

426
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,610
We've identified
a prime suspect, sir.

427
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:01,930
A police officer possibly
involved in setting up the ambush,

428
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,570
and a go-between with links to the
criminal parties who carried it out.

429
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,930
The missing link is in
Witness Protection, sir.

430
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,170
I'm nearly certain of it.
Who are these individuals?

431
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,210
I'd rather not say
at this particular time, sir.

432
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:16,090
"Rather not"? With respect, sir,
that's what no reciprocity means.

433
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,810
It's the appropriate way of
investigating blue-on-blue crime.

434
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:23,220
A way of keeping
the lid on internal leaks, sir.

435
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,700
Of course.

436
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,130
We're the best in the business, sir.

437
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,300
I think we can sort
this thing out pretty quickly.

438
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,050
I'll open up Witness Protection
to your team. Thank you, sir.

439
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,490
There's a DI in AC-9.

440
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,490
He's your man. You'll second him.

441
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,610
As you wish, sir.

442
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:51,210
Whatever it takes to nail
those bastards, right, Ted?

443
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,220
Absolutely. Thank you, sir.

444
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,740
Thought you could do with a lift.
Thanks.

445
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,610
Er, don't go.

446
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,410
Is there something I can do?

447
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,210
It's me, actually.

448
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,050
So far, I haven't done anything

449
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,890
towards your
professional development.

450
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,660
Well, you've had a lot
on your plate.

451
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,540
So...why Missing Persons?

452
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,730
Um... Well, it's challenging
detective work, plus,

453
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,970
when you do find them, it's
massively rewarding emotionally. Mm.

454
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,730
When you find them.

455
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:50,330
Yeah. It's not so
brilliant when you don't.

456
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,650
So, have you done
much of this before?

457
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,890
A year on a Misper Squad
at East Mids.

458
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:58,010
No! No, then you must
know Sally Fordham?

459
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,290
Um...

460
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:03,730
What? There isn't anybody
by that name on the squad.

461
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,380
Oh.

462
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,170
Sorry, I'm getting mixed up.

463
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,810
It's been a bit of a rough day.

464
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,690
Do you mind if we pick
this up another time?

465
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,540
Yeah. No worries. Great.

466
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,850
Kate.

467
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,780
Thanks for the tea.

468
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,570
My name is
Detective Inspector Denton,

469
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,930
from 4th Street Station.

470
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,850
I need to talk to
somebody who can give me

471
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,180
a list of all your
employees over the last year.

472
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,300
Seen DI Denton? No, sorry.

473
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,530
DS Arnott.

474
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,250
Denton's disappeared,
now she's asking me to meet her.

475
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,530
You suspicious?

476
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,770
I'm not sure.
It's an industrial unit.

477
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,090
A&B Carriage Repairs?

478
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,690
That's the empty repair garage
they used as a front.

479
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,970
Now I'm suspicious.

480
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,130
I'll call in back-up.

481
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,570
I know the location -
I can be there in ten minutes.

482
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,770
If she sees you, then...

483
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,530
We'll hold back till you
pocket-dial. Don't blow my cover.

484
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:24,370
I won't. But if anything
doesn't feel right, you call.

485
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,820
Received.

486
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,370
Boss.
You took your time, didn't you?

487
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,450
Sorry, I...
Christ's sake. It's round the back.

488
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,330
Isn't this place part of the
Major Violent Crime investigation?

489
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,850
I started ringing garages to see
if any of their employees

490
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,850
fitted the description
of Carly's boyfriend

491
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,410
and started acting suspiciously

492
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,530
around about the time
of the disappearance.

493
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,490
This place came up as disused

494
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,850
but crosschecked
with the MVC investigation.

495
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,690
Aren't they protecting the scene?

496
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,740
Forensics have finished.
They've released it.

497
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,410
Ma'am, is this a good idea,

498
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,610
what with AC-12's
investigation into the ambush?

499
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,850
Ugh!

500
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,370
Ugh...

501
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,530
Do I look like I was born yesterday?

502
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,330
I don't know what
you're talking about.

503
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,010
No? Brand-new DC, doesn't care
that I'm under investigation.

504
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:07,290
Wants to be my new best friend?
I'm just trying to get along. Yeah?

505
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:10,130
What have I told you
about being honest with me?

506
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,010
I hate liars.

507
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,210
DS Arnott, AC-12?

508
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,700
Boss...

509
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,970
People have underestimated me
my whole life.

510
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,460
Absolutely, It's fine. Nearly done.

511
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,700
I'll be there in ten. Promise.

512
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:43,260
Hi. 8:30 OK for
tomorrow's briefing?

513
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:48,820
Look, Jo, the Hargreaves interview,
the whole thing, this isn't working.

514
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,810
You're firing me? No.

515
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,700
You know that's more
hassle than it's worth.

516
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:00,690
You're bringing someone else in.
Why?

517
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,940
You have to ask? Seriously?

518
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,180
Can you talk?

519
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,250
What's there to say?

520
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,210
Everyone makes mistakes sometimes.

521
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,530
No way did Kate mess up.

522
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,060
We underestimated her.

523
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,890
I've let you down, sir.

524
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,380
Don't talk rubbish.

525
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,260
DI Denton doesn't know
the half we've got on her.

526
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,330
That call to the hospital,
now the stuff with the garage.

527
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:53,050
Steve, I want you to contact
Denton and her rep.

528
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,570
Tell her I want
her in here on a Reg 15.

529
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,700
Any prevarication, you arrest her.

530
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,770
I'm telling you.

531
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,610
She'll be wishing she never
messed with you

532
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,490
by the time we're through with her.

533
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,940
Sir.

534
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,810
Sure you're OK?

535
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,730
Wounded pride, that's all.

536
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,170
I'll give you a lift home.

537
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,340
Thanks, but it's best you don't.

538
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,460
How'd it go with Georgia's parents?

539
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,140
It went.

540
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,460
Hey.

541
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:55,140
Why didn't you tell me
she was your partner?

542
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,020
You were feeling bad enough already.

543
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:07,170
One thing the other
police officer said...

544
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:11,170
They said, me being the only witness,

545
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:15,330
chances were, Joe planned
to kill me afterwards.

546
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,780
You and your partner saved my life.

547
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,540
Suppose.

548
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,980
Had you been together long,
you and her?

549
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:22,970
AC-12 interview with DI Denton,
in the presence of DI Royal,

550
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,850
by Superintendent Hastings,
DS Arnott and DC Fleming.

551
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,500
DI Denton,
did you assault DC Fleming?

552
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:33,700
Sorry, sir, you'll have to help me.
Who's DC Fleming?

553
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:40,610
For the purposes of the tape,
I'm indicating DC Fleming.

554
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,900
I'm confused, sir. That's DC Foster.

555
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,330
The officer known to
you know as Foster -

556
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,050
did you assault her, yes or no?

557
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,810
No. You didn't strike her?

558
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,890
There was an altercation
that got a little bit physical.

559
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,690
For the tape, I note that DC Foster -
sorry, Fleming -

560
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,890
shows no significant injuries.

561
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,770
You're in the habit of
assaulting people, DI Denton? No.

562
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,850
Have you ever assaulted anyone? No.

563
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,730
Did you assault Lorna Barrett,
your next door neighbour? No.

564
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,340
She gave a statement alleging
you did. I'll read from it.

565
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:15,130
"Lindsay Denton struck me across
the side of the head with a bottle

566
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,610
"and then she beat my head
against the floor repeatedly."

567
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,570
Lorna Barrett's
an unreliable witness.

568
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,290
She's making a vexatious complaint.

569
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,090
I interviewed Lorna Barrett.

570
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,210
She provided a coherent
account of the assault,

571
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,450
had injuries consistent
with her version of events,

572
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,810
and accurately described
you as the assailant.

573
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,810
There's a witness
to my relationship with Ms Barrett.

574
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,090
She's in this room right now.

575
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,220
Shall I call you Foster or Fleming?

576
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,890
Fleming.

577
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:43,730
Ms Barrett played loud music
late at night. Can you confirm that?

578
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,930
Yes.

579
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,250
And did I respond in
a potentially aggressive fashion

580
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,170
to Ms Barrett's anti-social
behaviour?

581
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,450
No.

582
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,970
Ms Barrett's allegations represent
a history of anti-social conduct,

583
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,970
who you might have been
taken in by, DS Arnott,

584
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,420
though she doesn't appear
to be your type.

585
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:08,170
I think we should revisit
the events of 5th September.

586
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:11,970
DI Denton has already provided
a comprehensive statement

587
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,770
and interview in this regard.

588
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,090
Yes, as a witness.

589
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,290
These matters will
now be addressed under the terms

590
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:20,010
of the Regulation 15 notice
you've just been served, DS Arnott.

591
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:22,010
You've seen
this illustration before -

592
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,650
document five in your folders.

593
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:27,570
It shows the location of the
safe house, 12 St James' Close,

594
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:30,890
the route taken by the convoy,
the location of the ambush which

595
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:34,250
led to the deaths of DS Akers,
Sergeant Wallis and PC Butler.

596
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,570
It also shows the location
of 4th Street Station,

597
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:40,170
which DI Denton has claimed was
the intended destination that night.

598
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:44,250
DI Denton, this is now your
opportunity to amend

599
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,580
or clarify your previous statement.

600
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,330
I've got nothing to add.

601
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,210
DI Denton has nothing to add.

602
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,970
There is one specific point
we'd like to explore in more depth

603
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,820
with you, and that is the route.

604
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,850
This is an excerpt from the
first interview with DI Denton.

605
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,660
For the tape, a transcript
will appear on screen.

606
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,050
This back route, it would
lead to 4th Street Station,

607
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,250
but only if you'd continued
along Crown Avenue.

608
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,810
The vehicles turned
left into Long Lane...

609
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:22,850
The, um... The decision
appeared to make sense at the time.

610
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:27,450
There were roadworks
on Crown Avenue,

611
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:31,290
with temporary traffic signals
controlling a single lane.

612
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:34,090
It was a potential hold-up
that would've left us vulnerable.

613
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,170
There were no roadworks
on Crown Avenue that night.

614
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,540
Works had been completed
the day before.

615
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,530
I wasn't aware.

616
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:46,810
You didn't make a point
of getting up-to-date travel
information?

617
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,170
No.

618
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,130
DI Denton's service
vehicle is fitted with

619
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,370
a Type-60 Travel System.

620
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:58,050
I'm familiar with this system
and so is DI Denton.

621
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,050
I've been a passenger
in said vehicle

622
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,330
and observed DI Denton operate
this system faultlessly.

623
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:06,810
The TS-60 provides
instantaneous traffic

624
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:10,140
and roadworks information
relating to the chosen route.

625
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,890
The service vehicle driven
by DI Denton on the night

626
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,500
of the ambush was
also fitted with the TS-60.

627
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:21,850
This system was in operation on
the night of September 5th and would

628
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,900
have advised DI Denton there were
no longer roadworks on Crown Avenue.

629
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,690
You drove them straight into

630
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,180
that ambush, didn't you?

631
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,300
It was no accident, was it?

632
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:43,210
I genuinely believed
that there were roadworks.

633
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:44,970
In the stress of the situation,

634
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:47,170
I didn't even look
at the information on the sat nav.

635
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:50,700
I strenuously deny any involvement
in setting up the ambush.

636
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,210
Three of our own -
three of YOUR own -

637
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,810
in the morgue because of you,
DI Denton.

638
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:00,370
Make that four. Yes.

639
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,250
DC Georgia Trotman,
killed attempting to protect

640
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,250
the life of the witness
who was the target of that ambush.

641
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,290
DI Denton has absolutely
no connection

642
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:12,210
to the tragic death of DC Trotman.

643
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:15,250
You'll kindly keep your counsel
till we're said and done.

644
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,050
The witness survived the ambush
and was receiving treatment

645
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:21,250
when there was a second, successful,
attempt on his life.

646
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,170
DI Denton was observed
making a phone call

647
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,730
from a public telephone box

648
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,570
approximately 15 minutes
prior to the witness's death.

649
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,500
Why did you use a phone box?

650
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:32,890
I didn't want the call
appearing in my phone history.

651
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,420
Yeah we get that, DI Denton.
Why didn't you?

652
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,010
It was an impulse,
I knew it was inadvisable.

653
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:42,090
Said call was identified with the
number of the hospital switchboard -

654
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:44,330
it was put through to
the intensive care unit

655
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:45,970
where the witness was being treated.

656
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,130
The member of staff
who took the call has provided

657
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,970
a statement that the female caller
asked for Staff Nurse Tindall

658
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,570
by name, Staff Nurse Tindall
being the intensive care nurse

659
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,850
blackmailed into furnishing
access to the witness.

660
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,170
Who made that call, DI Denton?

661
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,090
Not me. I saw you make that call.

662
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:01,570
I'm not denying making A call.

663
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:04,530
The witness was the only person
who could verify that

664
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:07,490
I had nothing to do
with setting up the ambush.

665
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:10,050
I'd heard rumours that he
was about to regain consciousness

666
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,850
and I wanted to find out
if they were true.

667
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,770
How come you knew
the name of the nurse,

668
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:16,370
the very same nurse who was
involved in killing him? I didn't.

669
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,490
I hung up when they put me through.
I...

670
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:22,010
I realised it was a stupid
thing to do. I wasn't thinking.

671
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:24,890
You expect us to believe that?

672
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:27,090
If I had conspired in the murder...

673
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,450
Which you didn't.

674
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,930
..why on earth would I have made
a call at that exact time?

675
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,450
It would only incriminate me.

676
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,850
It does.

677
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,380
Funny that.

678
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:41,770
I'm sure you've seen this
e-fit before. Who is that man?

679
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:43,650
I've never seen him
before in my life.

680
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,890
He was at the hospital,
about to kill the witness

681
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:48,940
and DC Trotman, at exactly the
same time you made your phone call.

682
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:56,260
DS Arnott, what's your theory
on why I'd make that call?

683
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:58,890
It was a signal.

684
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:01,610
Or you got cold feet,
tried to call off the murder.

685
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:04,210
I'm as aware as you all are
that it isn't possible to trace

686
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:06,850
a call within
an internal telephone network.

687
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,490
All you can do is identify
the number dialled from the call box

688
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,650
as being that of the
hospital switchboard -

689
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,650
and I admit to that part.

690
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:16,210
After that, all you have
is the vague evidence from somebody

691
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,530
who can't be sure who called,
what they said, or why.

692
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:21,460
I deny that it was me
who asked to speak to the nurse.

693
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,020
That your final answer?

694
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,100
DC Fleming?

695
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,850
DI Denton text-messaged me
to attend a meeting

696
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,290
at the Canalside Industrial Estate,

697
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:43,930
purporting to be in connection
with a breakthrough

698
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,490
in a missing persons enquiry.

699
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,970
The specific location given
by DI Denton was a unit formerly

700
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,370
belonging to A&B Carriage Repairs.

701
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:54,090
This disused unit was a front
for individuals connected

702
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,730
with the 5th of September ambush.

703
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:59,890
What was your connection, DI Denton?

704
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,410
There's no connection to me.

705
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,010
I went there following
a lead on my investigation

706
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:07,930
into the disappearance
of a 15-year-old girl.

707
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,930
The fact that it'd gone out of
business and was already connected

708
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:14,530
to an ongoing investigation - these
facts only added to my suspicions.

709
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:16,650
Yes, but instead of
following your suspicions,

710
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:20,570
you assault DC Fleming.
I was emotional, sir. Why?

711
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:23,250
I imagined what it
must've been like for that girl

712
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,010
if she'd been abducted
to that place.

713
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:29,330
I was frustrated with the case, and
I was angry with DC Fleming's lies.

714
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:32,970
Lies, yes, you don't like
being lied to, do you, DI Denton?

715
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:35,730
The fact of the matter is,
neither do we.

716
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:37,250
DI Denton, I'm arresting you

717
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,330
for conspiracy to murder
a protected witness.

718
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,530
State the grounds.
You do not have to say anything.

719
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:44,210
Under Code G of the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act,

720
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,450
state the grounds.
Why are you arresting me?

721
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,810
As the arresting officer,
I submit...

722
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,810
One - you're the sole survivor
of an ambush

723
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,730
you had the means of setting up.

724
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:55,330
Two - you made a phone call,

725
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:58,330
and freely admit that
you made a phone call,

726
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:01,370
to the hospital, after which
two people were murdered.

727
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,730
Regarding the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act,

728
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:07,930
I note subsection
5C(1), C(2), E and F,

729
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:11,650
and I'm sure you're very
familiar with those terms.

730
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:16,570
Lindsay Denton, you do not have
to say anything, however,

731
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:19,650
you may harm your defence
if you fail to mention

732
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:23,450
when questioned something
you later rely on in court.

733
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,140
Anything you do say
may be used in evidence.

734
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:31,450
I would like to say something.

735
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,060
Keep the tape running.

736
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,410
Superintendent Hastings,

737
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:42,940
I have in my possession certain
financial records pertaining to you.

738
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:48,730
How the hell did you get these?

739
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,130
The document requests
were signed off by an officer

740
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:53,010
of Chief Superintendent rank.

741
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,290
Anything I say may be
used in evidence -

742
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,850
that works both ways, sir.

743
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,650
Sir, DI Denton has asked that
the tape be left running.

744
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,490
She's got a right to be heard.

745
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:05,210
Without going into details,
the records show that

746
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:09,380
Superintendent Hastings is in
considerable financial difficulties.

747
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:16,770
These have absolutely no relevance
to the case against you, DI Denton.

748
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:20,610
I'm reading from a transcript
of our first interview.

749
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:25,370
Superintendent Hastings -
"Our strongest supposition is that

750
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:27,530
"criminal interests
attempted to assassinate

751
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,810
"the witness
to prevent him testifying.

752
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:34,010
"Those interests would pay a pretty
penny for an inside man, or woman.

753
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:37,730
"Any officer in the kind of
financial mess you're in, DI Denton,

754
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,570
"is honour-bound to declare it,

755
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:42,100
"on account of vulnerability
to bribery."

756
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,180
Have you declared
your situation, sir?

757
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:50,170
Sir?

758
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,490
No.

759
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,180
"No."

760
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:01,580
DS Arnott, I'd like you
to view these photographs.

761
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:12,130
Do you recognise the location?

762
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:15,290
Yeah. This is the home,
under protective custody,

763
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,450
of Staff Nurse Claire Tindall.

764
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,690
You interviewed her in connection
with events at the hospital.

765
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:23,250
There are more photos.
How did you get these?

766
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,370
For the tape, the images
show DS Arnott returning

767
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:26,770
to Staff Nurse Tindall's home.

768
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:30,250
And he's later photographed
in an upstairs bedroom with her.

769
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,980
What was the purpose
of your return visit?

770
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:36,610
(Um...)

771
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:40,260
I'm sure you took notes of the
conversation. May we hear them?

772
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:45,740
No notes, then?

773
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,490
I'm sure you're aware -

774
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,370
or perhaps you're not, but I hope
that Superintendent Hastings is -

775
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:53,810
that inappropriate
relations with a witness

776
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:57,090
is a breach of the England & Wales
Police Conduct Regulations 2008.

777
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,130
I know the Regs.

778
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:00,450
Were you coaching
Staff Nurse Tindall to corroborate

779
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:03,170
the allegations against me
regarding the call to the hospital?

780
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:04,730
I don't have to. No?

781
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:07,050
I'd say you're in desperate
need of someone being able

782
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,450
to identify me as the caller.

783
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:11,180
Was Staff Nurse Tindall
able to do that for you?

784
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:17,500
For the tape,
DS Arnott's not forthcoming.

785
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,140
No. No, she wasn't able?

786
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:23,890
She wasn't able.

787
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:27,010
Was she able to state
any relationship with me?

788
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,300
No.

789
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:33,090
We've established that you know
the witness better than most.

790
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:34,660
Is she likely to lie?

791
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:39,980
No. If I was connected,
she'd say, wouldn't she?

792
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,090
Yes.

793
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:48,060
DS Arnott, you know a suspect's
three incriminating criteria.

794
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,970
Motive, opportunity, means.

795
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,410
Motive - I had none.

796
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:58,890
Why on earth would
I want to kill fellow officers?

797
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:02,130
Opportunity - I had none.

798
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:04,530
I only found out about
the witness in a phone call

799
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:07,290
one hour before the ambush.

800
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:10,210
Means - I had none.

801
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,130
I've never worked Serious Crime.

802
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:15,900
I don't have the criminal connections
to be able to conspire in an ambush.

803
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:19,570
DC Fleming.

804
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:21,460
Is this your mobile phone?

805
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:26,140
- Yes.
- Please speak up for the tape.

806
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,250
Yes.

807
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,090
I came into possession
of this mobile phone

808
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:32,730
during our altercation
at the Canalside Industrial Estate,

809
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:33,820
is that correct?

810
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:38,290
Yeah. You stole it from me.

811
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:41,490
Your call history makes
for very interesting reading.

812
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:44,300
Significant people
at significant times.

813
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:48,930
Stealing is against the law.

814
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:50,740
My bad.

815
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:54,450
Let's save the rest of this
conversation for another time.

816
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,770
Does that suit you, Kate?
Interview terminated.

817
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:59,450
Show's over.

818
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,020
Steve, you hold her here.

819
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:05,500
Kate, you organise the custody.

820
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,610
The best I can do for
you now, Lindsay,

821
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,580
is find you a good solicitor.

822
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,490
AC-12 are bringing in an officer.

823
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:24,770
She works at 4th Street Station, so
ideally somewhere she's not known.

824
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:32,330
We'll fax over the paperwork
for charging. Thanks.

825
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:34,650
They've handed over
the Witness Protection files.

826
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:37,010
Let's get cracking.
I want this place locked down.

827
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:40,570
Access by named personnel only.
Keep an eye on her. Shut the door.

828
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:42,730
Not one piece of paper shall leave
this building

829
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:45,180
without my approval in triplicate.
Thank you.

830
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,220
Good man.

831
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:54,820
Mother of God.

832
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:59,930
The protected witness.
The wee gobshite this was all about.

833
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:01,580
Christ.

834
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,290
We need to start over.

835
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:15,850
Call your wives, your husbands,
your boyfriends, your girlfriends.

836
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:19,250
No-one is leaving the premises
till we have sifted through

837
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,340
every single piece of information.

838
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:48,420
What was in
the Witness Protection files?

839
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,780
I saw the reaction.
Was it the witness?

840
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,010
Oh, my God. Was it someone you knew?

841
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:01,740
I can't discuss this.

842
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,490
How can you let this happen to me,

843
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:07,100
when you know that there's
so much more to it?

844
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:13,980
Let's go.

845
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:31,650
DS Arnott, DI Denton.

846
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,810
You OK to book her in for me?

847
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:36,930
Lindsay Denton,
I'm satisfied your arrest is lawful.

848
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:39,770
I'm authorising your detention
at this police station

849
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:43,690
so that we can secure and preserve
evidence of the investigation,

850
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:45,730
and to obtain evidence from you...

851
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:04,220
I'm innocent. You know I am.

852
00:58:05,305 --> 00:59:05,760

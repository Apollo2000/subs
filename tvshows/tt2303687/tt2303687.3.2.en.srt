1
00:00:01,727 --> 00:00:02,927
Armed police!

3
00:00:12,835 --> 00:00:15,755
Shoot over the suspect's body
in the direction you'd have fired

4
00:00:15,755 --> 00:00:19,035
if you'd have actually managed to
get here in time.

5
00:00:19,035 --> 00:00:20,333
Jesus!

6
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,853
We're in this together. Best way.

7
00:00:25,013 --> 00:00:26,853
You shot that fellow in cold blood

8
00:00:26,853 --> 00:00:29,573
- while your wee mates stood by and watched!
- What was that?

9
00:00:29,573 --> 00:00:32,293
- Interview's finished, Danny.
- I'm not. - Good.

10
00:00:33,127 --> 00:00:34,403
Neither are we.

11
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:39,269
You know why I've been appointed -
to ensure that anti-corruption

12
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:42,029
inquiries don't get pulled
apart in court.

13
00:00:44,242 --> 00:00:46,002
Don't try playing the big man.

14
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,630
We both know you're not up to it.

15
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,030
She definitely does.

16
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,670
You need me to make the hard choices
for you,

17
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,037
because I see what's inside you.

18
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,430
Jelly.

19
00:00:58,281 --> 00:01:01,340
Putting Kate into an AFO role is a
whole level of jeopardy

20
00:01:01,365 --> 00:01:03,836
above a normal undercover...
I can handle it.

21
00:01:07,238 --> 00:01:10,284
Is that the file on the suspect
shot by Waldron? Yeah.

22
00:01:10,284 --> 00:01:12,883
We need an unredacted file.
Leave it to me.

23
00:01:12,883 --> 00:01:14,588
You didn't know the suspect.

24
00:01:14,588 --> 00:01:17,816
No. Ronan Murphy.
The suspect's name.

25
00:01:18,148 --> 00:01:19,468
Don't remember me?

26
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:23,460
The only thing with Ronan,
it was over too fast.

27
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:27,588
'If there's something bigger here,
Danny,

28
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,908
'you don't want to be the one
left carrying the can.'

29
00:01:32,908 --> 00:01:36,013
'You better come up here,
skipper.' On my way.

30
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,484
Shot fired! Shot fired!

31
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,967
What's he saying? What's he saying?!

32
00:01:46,992 --> 00:01:49,592
Stay with me, Danny. Danny! Danny!

33
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:54,221
'..Abbott's Lane. One
officer seriously wounded. GSW.'

34
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,270
Come on, guys.

35
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,546
Come away. Let them in.

36
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,510
Come on, Kate.
Let's leave them to it.

37
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,013
Let me in.

38
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:07,790
Weak pulse, right carotid.

39
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,790
Let's get suction on,
secure the airway...

40
00:02:19,403 --> 00:02:21,470
What the hell happened in there?

41
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,470
Still in shock, guv.

42
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,190
I just need a couple of minutes
to get my head round it.

43
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,624
Still making sense of it, guv.

44
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,110
Get them to the station.

45
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,350
You too, Francis.

46
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,350
Maintaining pressure on
left submandibular GSW.

47
00:03:18,397 --> 00:03:21,055
DS Arnott, AC-12.

48
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:23,339
Is he talking?
I need to talk to him.

49
00:03:23,339 --> 00:03:25,226
The incident took place
inside the bedroom,

50
00:03:25,225 --> 00:03:27,305
so it's off-limits
except to preserve life.

51
00:03:27,305 --> 00:03:29,814
Single GSW to the neck.
Sinus rhythm,

52
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:31,884
but BP's in his boots.
Sats dropping.

53
00:03:31,884 --> 00:03:33,351
Is he going to make it?

54
00:03:36,364 --> 00:03:37,564
Stand by, everyone.

55
00:03:37,564 --> 00:03:40,804
You need to fill in your pocket
books, then there'll be a debrief.

56
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,906
Before you do anything, you'll be
walked through it all by Legal.

57
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:45,531
Any news on Danny yet?

58
00:03:47,371 --> 00:03:50,451
Sinus bradia. He's gone asystolic.

59
00:03:50,451 --> 00:03:52,611
Let's get him in.

60
00:03:52,971 --> 00:03:54,566
OK, we're losing him.

61
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:57,802
I've got asystole on the monitor
and no output. Fluids wide open.

62
00:03:57,802 --> 00:04:01,762
- Off vent and bag him.
- Start CPR. Adrenaline 1mg.

63
00:04:11,923 --> 00:04:15,521
Four cycles of CPR given, we've had
no output with chest compressions,

64
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:19,135
no carotid pulse,
asystole on the monitor.

65
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,923
Pronounce life extinct 08:34.

66
00:04:24,123 --> 00:04:25,963
Thanks, everybody. Sorry about that.

67
00:04:25,963 --> 00:04:28,043
We need to leave everything as is
for the coroner.

68
00:04:28,043 --> 00:04:30,483
<i>Disconnect monitoring, oxygen...</i>

69
00:04:34,723 --> 00:04:38,363
<i>Don't touch anything else in case
we contaminate...</i>

70
00:04:59,643 --> 00:05:01,923
So is anyone going to tell me
what actually happened?

71
00:05:01,923 --> 00:05:03,243
Jesus Christ, Kate.

72
00:05:06,323 --> 00:05:07,963
- There was a struggle.
- Who with?

73
00:05:07,963 --> 00:05:09,810
We were all involved.

74
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:12,963
Danny had his firearm out
and it just went off.

75
00:05:12,963 --> 00:05:15,403
I didn't hear a struggle.
You were downstairs. Jesus!

76
00:05:15,403 --> 00:05:17,963
And from downstairs,
I didn't hear a struggle.

77
00:05:17,963 --> 00:05:21,294
By the time I got upstairs, not one
of you was giving Danny first aid.

78
00:05:21,523 --> 00:05:23,243
What did Danny say to you?

79
00:05:26,523 --> 00:05:28,530
He whispered something to you,
what did he say?

80
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,250
- I'm not sure what he meant.
- No, I know, but what did he...

81
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:32,657
What did he actually say?

82
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:38,619
Just cos you didn't hear a struggle
doesn't mean there wasn't one.

83
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,480
Why didn't one of you help Danny?

84
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,743
He was lying on the floor,

85
00:05:41,768 --> 00:05:44,680
- he'd been shot and there was blood everywhere.
- We were in shock!

86
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,720
What, you couldn't lift a finger?
Couldn't call for help?

87
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,899
Look, do we have to talk
about this right now?

88
00:05:52,506 --> 00:05:56,320
All I can see in my head is Danny
just lying there, bleeding out, man.

89
00:05:57,176 --> 00:05:59,009
- What was your RT about?
- What RT?

90
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:01,969
- You radioed Danny telling him to come up.
- Did I? - Yeah.

91
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,889
You said, "Better come up here, skipper."

92
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:05,085
I'll have to hear the recording.

93
00:06:05,086 --> 00:06:07,286
You were back-to-back on two,
so there is no recording.

94
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:09,005
Can you just...stop?

95
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:11,965
You're doing my head in.

96
00:06:12,326 --> 00:06:13,762
You know, if I'm going to go along
with this,

97
00:06:13,762 --> 00:06:15,442
I need to know what
I'm covering for.

98
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:21,521
Fine.

99
00:06:21,944 --> 00:06:24,584
The ballistics will say what
really happened in that bedroom.

100
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:25,984
Yeah, you'd think.

101
00:06:38,284 --> 00:06:40,944
Time, gaffer? I say they had plenty.

102
00:06:49,864 --> 00:06:52,304
- DC Francis.
- Sir.

103
00:06:53,304 --> 00:06:55,864
Right. Let's get straight down to
brass tacks.

104
00:06:55,864 --> 00:06:58,937
How did Sergeant Daniel Waldron
meet his death?

105
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,520
- He died in the ambulance, sir.
- You know exactly what I mean.

106
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:05,264
Danny Waldron shot himself, sir.

107
00:07:05,264 --> 00:07:07,144
Danny put the gun to his own head.

108
00:07:08,315 --> 00:07:09,880
We were trying to help him.

109
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,475
But we, we couldn't get the gun off
him and the firearm discharged.

110
00:07:13,664 --> 00:07:14,957
By the time I entered the room,

111
00:07:14,957 --> 00:07:16,599
Danny was already bleeding
profusely.

112
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:19,079
- Did you administer first aid?
- Kate...

113
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:22,881
Erm...Victor Charlie 55

114
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:25,730
and she ran in and tried to
control the bleeding

115
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,650
until the paramedics arrived.

116
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,090
So you didn't administer first aid?

117
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,046
Well, you hope you know what
to do in them situations,

118
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:35,817
until it comes to it.

119
00:07:36,053 --> 00:07:36,985
Uh-huh.

120
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:43,030
Image 297. A ballistic simulation
of the bullet's trajectory.

121
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,100
It appears the fatal shot was fired
in a position

122
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,340
close to Sergeant Waldron's chest
and aimed upwards.

123
00:07:48,854 --> 00:07:52,309
- That how it happened, Constable?
- Yes, sir.

124
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:57,509
Now, forensics detected firearms residue
on your hands, Victor Charlie 54,

125
00:07:57,783 --> 00:08:02,638
and the hands of your mates,
Victor Charlie 52 and 53, so...

126
00:08:02,943 --> 00:08:04,583
that would all seem to fit.

127
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,966
Well, case closed.
We can all knock off early.

128
00:08:12,023 --> 00:08:14,734
There is an alternative
explanation as to why you

129
00:08:14,734 --> 00:08:16,584
had your hands on that gun.

130
00:08:16,777 --> 00:08:18,977
Well, as I said, sir,
we were trying to get it off him.

131
00:08:18,978 --> 00:08:22,818
You weren't trying to force that
firearm under Waldron's chin?

132
00:08:22,843 --> 00:08:25,602
That's a horrible accusation.
We tried to save Danny.

133
00:08:25,602 --> 00:08:28,202
- Who grabbed the gun first?
- Harry did, sir. Sorry.

134
00:08:30,602 --> 00:08:32,242
Victor Charlie 54.

135
00:08:33,616 --> 00:08:36,377
I didn't even know that Danny
had drawn his gun

136
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,388
and the next minute,
Harry's wrestling him for the gun

137
00:08:39,388 --> 00:08:40,748
and he's shouting, "Danny, no!"

138
00:08:40,748 --> 00:08:42,500
And he's calling for me
and Rod to help him!

139
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,740
The three of us ended up
fighting over the gun.

140
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,623
We did everything we could to try
and stop him, we just couldn't.

141
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,303
- Did he make any kind of statement?
- He tried to say something.

142
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,828
What did he say?

143
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,820
I couldn't make it out, sir.

144
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,820
Now, Daniel Waldron,
as you know, was

145
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,517
involved in the shooting of a
suspect during Operation Damson.

146
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:06,063
You and Victor Charlie 52
and 53 were on his team

147
00:09:06,063 --> 00:09:07,698
and witnessed what really happened.

148
00:09:07,928 --> 00:09:10,768
Was Danny coercing you into
corroborating his version of events?

149
00:09:10,768 --> 00:09:14,879
No. The tape - I am referring to
a transcript of an interview

150
00:09:14,904 --> 00:09:16,824
with you on May 21st.

151
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:18,984
DI Cottan and I repeatedly ask you

152
00:09:18,984 --> 00:09:21,354
if there are inaccuracies in your
account of Sergeant Waldron's

153
00:09:21,354 --> 00:09:25,258
shooting of Ronan Murphy, to which
you replied, "I can't do this."

154
00:09:25,283 --> 00:09:27,883
"I'm sorry. I can't do this."

155
00:09:27,883 --> 00:09:30,510
"No way am I testifying
against Danny Waldron."

156
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,768
- No. - How's about Danny Waldron
scared you into covering for him

157
00:09:34,768 --> 00:09:36,522
and then the three of you
club together

158
00:09:36,523 --> 00:09:39,092
- and then you put an end to it?
- No, no.

159
00:09:39,117 --> 00:09:42,517
That's just not what happened.
Will you please stop this?

160
00:09:42,517 --> 00:09:45,129
- It's really upsetting!
- If Danny was threatening me,

161
00:09:45,154 --> 00:09:46,594
I would've reported him
without a doubt.

162
00:09:46,594 --> 00:09:48,130
All I had to do was report him.

163
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:50,275
He can be a difficult bastard,
yeah, but on an op,

164
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:51,651
you've got your skipper's back!

165
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:53,864
We were trying to save him,
not hurt him.

166
00:09:53,864 --> 00:09:56,830
Danny Waldron killed himself, sir,
that's the honest truth.

167
00:09:56,855 --> 00:10:01,441
Why, though? Given back his firearms
licence, he was operational again.

168
00:10:01,617 --> 00:10:04,457
As far as Waldron was concerned,
the case against him was closed.

169
00:10:04,457 --> 00:10:06,297
Who knows what was
going on in his head?

170
00:10:06,297 --> 00:10:10,985
I was downstairs at the Abbott's Lane address and
didn't witness the incident at the upstairs bedroom.

171
00:10:12,417 --> 00:10:15,657
Authorised firearms officer
Victor Charlie 52,

172
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:18,352
Victor Charlie 53,
Victor Charlie 54,

173
00:10:18,377 --> 00:10:21,337
in my view, you have failed to give
a plausible account of the events

174
00:10:21,337 --> 00:10:23,682
leading up to the death of
Sergeant Daniel Waldron

175
00:10:23,682 --> 00:10:26,642
and, therefore, I am arresting
you on suspicion of his murder.

176
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:29,442
Now, you don't have to say anything,
however,

177
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:31,922
it may harm your defence if you
fail to mention something

178
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:35,562
under questioning that you later
go on to rely on in court

179
00:10:35,562 --> 00:10:39,599
and, of course, anything you do say
may be taken down in evidence.

180
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,082
Look, I'm after a cell for a copper,
someone where no-one knows her.

181
00:10:46,082 --> 00:10:48,522
I need to arrange custody
for a police officer at a station

182
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,682
where he's unknown.
Now.

183
00:10:54,212 --> 00:10:57,442
I wonder if, on reflection,
you'd consider that perhaps you

184
00:10:57,442 --> 00:10:59,682
should've run it by me first.

185
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:03,135
Four coppers went into a room,
only three came out alive.

186
00:11:03,135 --> 00:11:04,615
That's what I considered.

187
00:11:04,615 --> 00:11:08,135
They'd experienced a tragic
and shocking event.

188
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:10,815
They've admitted that they were
too traumatised to even remember

189
00:11:10,815 --> 00:11:11,973
first aid.

190
00:11:11,973 --> 00:11:13,543
Their Police Federation reps

191
00:11:13,568 --> 00:11:15,699
and their legal advisers
are arguing that perhaps

192
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:18,525
they were sent back to work too soon
after the Damson shooting.

193
00:11:18,525 --> 00:11:21,553
Their inspector's getting it in the
neck for not disbanding the squad

194
00:11:21,553 --> 00:11:24,581
and, frankly, I think they've all
got a point.

195
00:11:24,606 --> 00:11:28,097
But it was you who vetoed
their suspensions!

196
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:30,690
I mean, they're only back at work
because of you!

197
00:11:30,715 --> 00:11:33,627
What steps have you taken to
evaluate Danny Waldron's

198
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:36,800
- mental state?
- Come on, you don't honestly believe he killed himself.

199
00:11:36,825 --> 00:11:38,543
He had a history of
professional discord,

200
00:11:38,543 --> 00:11:41,944
no stable relationship,
he certainly had risk factors.

201
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:44,471
And he did it just like that,
in front of his whole squad

202
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,636
-  in the middle of an op.
- We're speculating.

203
00:11:46,636 --> 00:11:49,807
What we know for sure is that if you
can't successfully charge them

204
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:54,588
in the next 36 hours, it will be
a hugely embarrassing climb-down.

205
00:11:56,206 --> 00:12:01,457
My sincere advice is to take
a more circumspect approach.

206
00:12:01,457 --> 00:12:05,632
Rescind the arrests in favour
of revoking their firearms permits

207
00:12:05,657 --> 00:12:08,898
and confining them to desk duties
while enquiries continue.

208
00:12:08,898 --> 00:12:10,059
What?

209
00:12:12,477 --> 00:12:14,517
And that isn't a climb-down?

210
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:24,238
- Forget it.
- Scrap that.

211
00:12:26,798 --> 00:12:29,918
Let's not fall out, Ted.
I'm here to help.

212
00:12:30,785 --> 00:12:34,581
I should also emphasise
the importance of confidentiality.

213
00:12:34,581 --> 00:12:38,640
We already have a legal suppression
order in place to restrict press coverage.

214
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:42,975
The PCC and the Chief Constable
are in complete agreement on this.

215
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,600
In the absence of hard facts around
Danny Waldron's death,

216
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,955
we don't want wild speculation
to affect public confidence.

217
00:12:50,955 --> 00:12:53,144
I mean, if you and the PCC

218
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:55,929
and the Chief Constable are all
in agreement...

219
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,589
..who am I to argue?

220
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:21,022
Let there be no misunderstanding,
I do not care what the lawyer says,

221
00:13:21,047 --> 00:13:23,847
we are going to investigate
that mob.

222
00:13:25,473 --> 00:13:26,673
Sir.

223
00:13:28,645 --> 00:13:31,420
Sir, I don't think we should close
the investigation into

224
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,660
Danny Waldron's background.
Hari Baines was right.

225
00:13:34,989 --> 00:13:37,789
Danny had his demons
and I'd like to keep digging.

226
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:40,999
Thank you, sir.

227
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:48,199
Armed police! Armed police!

228
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:56,919
- Check upstairs.
<i>- Armed police! Armed police!</i>

229
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:02,999
All clear.

230
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:16,839
Sarge.

231
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:18,959
Hello, there.

232
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:23,519
No-one said anything about
Danny Waldron having a dog.

233
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,239
He didn't.

234
00:14:35,344 --> 00:14:38,041
- Sorry, who's that?
- 'PC Maneet Bindra.'

235
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:39,957
- I've been posted.
<i>- It's DS Arnott.</i>

236
00:14:39,982 --> 00:14:42,940
I'm trying to track the owner of a missing dog.
I've tried the number on its collar,

237
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:47,223
<i>- but it's out of service.</i> - If you would give
me the number, Sarge, I'll try and get you a lead.

238
00:14:48,812 --> 00:14:52,822
077 009 00 381.

239
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,338
Just get it done.

240
00:15:00,012 --> 00:15:03,452
Item reference SJ P2,
Daniel Waldron's handset.

241
00:15:21,365 --> 00:15:24,331
I've got a firearm in here.
No-one enter.

242
00:15:24,772 --> 00:15:29,052
We need someone firearms-trained to
make safe. Jonesy's downstairs.

243
00:15:29,052 --> 00:15:30,228
Yes, sir.

244
00:15:32,612 --> 00:15:35,172
<i>Jonesy, guv wants you. Firearm.</i>

245
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,515
- Sir?
- Yeah, all yours, Jonesy.

246
00:16:02,006 --> 00:16:04,166
We seized a laptop and a phone.

247
00:16:04,615 --> 00:16:08,634
We won't have any more info on
Danny Waldron's data files till the morning.

248
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:12,458
- Right. - Grab a seat.
- Cheers. - OK.

249
00:16:12,696 --> 00:16:15,872
Illegal firearm.
No information on its origin.

250
00:16:15,897 --> 00:16:21,657
Plus, the case and its contents.
Storage receipt - trying to trace.

251
00:16:21,657 --> 00:16:24,584
Photo - looking into this and all.

252
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:26,129
And this.

253
00:16:29,245 --> 00:16:33,249
- What was in it? - Nothing.
- What, an envelope with nothing inside?

254
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:35,237
Well, that's what the report says.

255
00:16:35,405 --> 00:16:38,482
So, look, we need to have a quick
operational briefing. Right.

256
00:16:38,507 --> 00:16:41,162
You're following leads
on Danny Waldron,

257
00:16:41,187 --> 00:16:43,581
which means I'm after
Baines, Brickford and Kennedy.

258
00:16:43,582 --> 00:16:46,820
- That sound about right to you?
- Yeah. Good.

259
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,700
As Kate's undercover
is on my side of the line,

260
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,578
is there any probs
if I look after liaison?

261
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,060
Erm...

262
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,486
What? I thought you'd be happy,
you know.

263
00:16:58,511 --> 00:17:00,671
Avoid skulking about in dark alleys.

264
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:04,351
Yeah, it's... Kate and I have worked
together for three years now.

265
00:17:04,351 --> 00:17:07,631
- Yeah, and you've got a partnership.
- Yeah. Exactly.

266
00:17:08,052 --> 00:17:09,872
Look, I get it.

267
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:13,847
But like I said, it's on my side
of the investigation.

268
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:29,023
- All right? - All right?
- This will warm your cockles. - Oh, ta.

269
00:17:29,023 --> 00:17:31,183
Steve never brought refreshments.

270
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,823
Look, there's not really much
to report. It's early days.

271
00:17:33,823 --> 00:17:36,663
It's just, gaffer's got me on the
trail of the Three Wise Monkeys.

272
00:17:36,663 --> 00:17:38,743
Right, well, now all three of them
are Speak No Evil.

273
00:17:38,743 --> 00:17:41,719
Well, it's up to you to change all
that, ain't it? No pressure.

274
00:17:41,719 --> 00:17:44,399
- No pressure
- What did Waldron say?

275
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:47,729
- When?
- You know, his dying words.

276
00:17:47,729 --> 00:17:49,607
Word. He started to say, "Listen,"

277
00:17:49,607 --> 00:17:52,295
and that was all he could get out.
Why?

278
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,664
Just curious.

279
00:17:54,887 --> 00:17:57,287
I noticed your reaction
to me in the interview.

280
00:17:57,287 --> 00:17:59,887
Did I say something that didn't
hit the right note?

281
00:17:59,887 --> 00:18:04,127
Just...you're a brilliant liar,
that's all. Kind of unsettled me.

282
00:18:05,496 --> 00:18:09,447
- Well, thanks for the drink. - Any time.
- Night, Dot. - Night.

283
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:31,609
- Arnott.
- It's Maneet, Sarge. Sorry to bother you

284
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:35,369
but that out-of-service number
relates to a discontinued account.

285
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:38,409
The dog owner must not have updated
the information on the collar.

286
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,437
<i>It's a Linus Murphy.
Lives locally.</i>

287
00:18:41,849 --> 00:18:44,249
- Did you say Murphy?
<i>- Yes, Sarge.</i>

288
00:18:44,745 --> 00:18:47,752
Right, yeah. Text me the address
and organise some armed backup.

289
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,312
Will do, Sarge.

290
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:51,154
Work.

291
00:18:51,552 --> 00:18:52,712
It's all right.

292
00:18:55,152 --> 00:18:56,952
- Love ya.
- Love you, too.

293
00:19:02,352 --> 00:19:04,224
Armed police!

294
00:19:06,752 --> 00:19:07,792
Anyone home?

295
00:19:11,432 --> 00:19:12,592
Found your dog.

296
00:19:19,632 --> 00:19:20,792
Check upstairs.

297
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,054
Don't.

298
00:20:10,632 --> 00:20:11,872
Don't come in.

299
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:15,987
Call for forensic deployment.

300
00:20:16,312 --> 00:20:18,592
Keep checking for other casualties.

301
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:20,832
Sir. All right?

302
00:20:23,468 --> 00:20:26,872
There's evidence of prolonged
torture. Cause of death isn't clear.

303
00:20:26,872 --> 00:20:28,755
Cutting his head off
can't have helped.

304
00:20:28,815 --> 00:20:31,075
- Lack of blood from the neck means...
- Joke.

305
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,912
I'm a bloody detective inspector.

306
00:20:32,912 --> 00:20:35,022
I can tell he was
decapitated postmortem.

307
00:20:35,022 --> 00:20:36,862
Can't have been to conceal his ID.

308
00:20:36,863 --> 00:20:39,623
I mean, the premises are full of
evidence confirming who he is.

309
00:20:39,886 --> 00:20:42,406
Going through the findings
in Danny Waldron's flat,

310
00:20:42,406 --> 00:20:44,518
the receipt relates
to a storage company.

311
00:20:44,517 --> 00:20:46,077
Danny left something for us to find.

312
00:20:46,077 --> 00:20:47,837
I'm liaising with
the company to find out

313
00:20:47,837 --> 00:20:50,477
- which of their facilities the receipt originates from.
- Good.

314
00:20:50,796 --> 00:20:52,876
Danny Waldron's
telecommunications history

315
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,099
is very quiet in the days
leading up to his death.

316
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:57,339
There's only one contact
that stands out.

317
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,139
A call from a mobile lasting
only two seconds

318
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:03,524
and then a text message
from this same mobile number.

319
00:21:03,939 --> 00:21:05,419
Got ID on the contact?

320
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:08,179
The mobile service provider has
disclosed the registered user.

321
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:10,259
I'm just crosschecking
with the DVLA to see

322
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:12,859
if the driving licence photocard
matches the selfie.

323
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:13,899
Well done. Well done.

324
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:16,019
The hard drive of
Danny Waldron's work computer

325
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:18,059
hasn't revealed
anything suspicious as yet.

326
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:20,299
The same goes for
the domestic laptop we seized

327
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:22,579
and I'm still trying
to trace this photo.

328
00:21:23,739 --> 00:21:24,779
Good work.

329
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:29,053
Let me know when you've got
the info on the storage facility.

330
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:49,179
All right? Must be nice having all
this extra energy to work off.

331
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:50,899
Is that supposed to be funny?

332
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:52,339
Look, I've swerved desk duties

333
00:21:52,339 --> 00:21:55,339
but AC-12 are going to keep
after all of you, me included.

334
00:21:55,339 --> 00:21:56,819
We can't run away from them.

335
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:57,674
Really?

336
00:21:58,699 --> 00:22:01,218
Is that why they've had to
back off arresting us?

337
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:03,791
That's cos they haven't
got enough evidence yet.

338
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:07,952
- That'll change when they know
about Hari's radio call. - Yeah?

339
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,998
Well, the only way they'll know
about that is if you tell them.

340
00:22:12,023 --> 00:22:13,252
Or Hari does.

341
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,463
He seems pretty nervous to me.

342
00:22:15,463 --> 00:22:18,458
We went into the room,
there was no-one there.

343
00:22:18,878 --> 00:22:21,364
We had to get a steer on whether
to look for firearms

344
00:22:21,389 --> 00:22:22,761
or to call in for a search team.

345
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:24,801
Didn't sound like that to me.

346
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:27,518
Hari said, "Better come up here,"
like there was trouble.

347
00:22:27,518 --> 00:22:29,878
- That put Danny on edge, so he drew his firearm.
- OK, so?

348
00:22:29,877 --> 00:22:32,286
So, someone was entrapping Danny.

349
00:22:32,837 --> 00:22:34,397
You know something, Kate?

350
00:22:35,597 --> 00:22:36,917
You don't know a thing.

351
00:23:08,717 --> 00:23:11,517
DS Arnott. We spoke on the phone.

352
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:12,997
Got this receipt here.

353
00:23:31,637 --> 00:23:33,157
Can you step back, please?

354
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:28,517
Oh, it must have made a right whiff.

355
00:24:28,517 --> 00:24:29,757
Yeah.

356
00:24:29,757 --> 00:24:31,637
- Sir?
- Yeah.

357
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:33,997
Looks like this is
Linus Murphy's missing head,

358
00:24:33,997 --> 00:24:36,400
although we're just
waiting on full forensics.

359
00:24:36,674 --> 00:24:38,914
And the postmortem?

360
00:24:38,914 --> 00:24:40,754
Report came through earlier.

361
00:24:40,754 --> 00:24:44,238
Multiple serious cut and gouging
wounds to the chest, abdomen,

362
00:24:44,263 --> 00:24:47,543
genitals and anus. The cause of
death was internal haemorrhaging

363
00:24:47,543 --> 00:24:48,976
due to a pelvic fracture.

364
00:24:48,977 --> 00:24:51,617
No prints or fibres were found
on the implements or the body

365
00:24:51,617 --> 00:24:52,857
or at the premises,

366
00:24:52,857 --> 00:24:55,937
therefore it's still not possible
to pin the murder on Danny Waldron.

367
00:24:55,937 --> 00:24:59,977
However, the photograph shows
Danny Waldron as a teenager

368
00:24:59,977 --> 00:25:03,585
and facial recognition software
gives a 99.5% likelihood

369
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,443
this man is a young Ronan Murphy,

370
00:25:05,601 --> 00:25:08,441
the suspect shot by Danny Waldron
during Operation Damson.

371
00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:09,841
What, they knew each other?

372
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,681
And this person bears
a strong resemblance

373
00:25:11,681 --> 00:25:13,202
to Linus Murphy's severed head.

374
00:25:13,481 --> 00:25:15,001
Danny knew him too.

375
00:25:15,001 --> 00:25:17,721
What the hell are they both doing
in a photograph with Waldron?

376
00:25:17,721 --> 00:25:19,895
I'll update you when
I've got more facts, sir.

377
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:22,579
Now, there's nothing
inside the envelope

378
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:26,381
but I believe that's because Danny
Waldron met his death prematurely.

379
00:25:26,697 --> 00:25:30,260
I mean, all these mementos would
seem to be clues to his activities.

380
00:25:30,285 --> 00:25:31,982
I reckon, at some point he intended

381
00:25:32,007 --> 00:25:33,703
to include something
more in the envelope.

382
00:25:33,704 --> 00:25:35,064
Makes sense.

383
00:25:36,464 --> 00:25:37,050
Yes?

384
00:25:37,351 --> 00:25:40,243
The ID checks out
on Danny Waldron's last contact.

385
00:25:40,243 --> 00:25:41,963
Rachel O'Connor.

386
00:25:41,963 --> 00:25:43,283
Thanks, Maneet.

387
00:25:45,843 --> 00:25:47,634
Good work, Steve. Carry on.

388
00:25:49,243 --> 00:25:50,288
Yeah.

389
00:25:51,043 --> 00:25:52,083
Nice one.

390
00:26:12,883 --> 00:26:15,323
May I ask what is, or was,
your relationship with

391
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,763
Sergeant Danny Waldron?

392
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:20,620
We met on a night out.

393
00:26:21,603 --> 00:26:24,153
He was with a bunch
of his police mates.

394
00:26:24,603 --> 00:26:26,603
Analysis of Danny's
phone records reveals

395
00:26:26,603 --> 00:26:30,763
a call from your mobile phone to
his lasting a couple of seconds.

396
00:26:30,763 --> 00:26:32,723
That was the night we met.

397
00:26:32,723 --> 00:26:34,896
I was giving him my phone number.

398
00:26:35,643 --> 00:26:38,949
Sorry to pry but it might
help our investigation to know

399
00:26:38,974 --> 00:26:40,581
the extent of your relationship.

400
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:44,018
We had a couple of drinks
and he walked me home.

401
00:26:44,207 --> 00:26:46,071
He didn't come inside.

402
00:26:46,774 --> 00:26:47,509
Thank you.

403
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:48,961
You sent him a text message?

404
00:26:48,962 --> 00:26:50,570
A couple of days later.

405
00:26:51,291 --> 00:26:52,803
I hadn't heard from him.

406
00:26:53,188 --> 00:26:54,669
When did you see him again?

407
00:26:54,694 --> 00:26:55,915
I didn't.

408
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,752
Did he seem troubled to you,

409
00:26:59,777 --> 00:27:02,054
or concerned about
something in particular?

410
00:27:02,225 --> 00:27:03,115
No.

411
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,170
We were having a good time.

412
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:09,941
I was disappointed
he never got back to me.

413
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:10,824
Why?

414
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:13,316
He seemed very lonely.

415
00:27:14,396 --> 00:27:16,816
I thought he needed
to make a connection.

416
00:27:17,381 --> 00:27:19,139
Seems like I was wrong.

417
00:27:19,454 --> 00:27:20,633
You're not wrong.

418
00:27:21,177 --> 00:27:22,899
How is he? Is he OK?

419
00:27:25,698 --> 00:27:27,081
Very sorry, miss.

420
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:31,298
A few days ago, Danny Waldron
was killed in the line of duty.

421
00:28:02,938 --> 00:28:05,498
<i>Hi, this is Sam.
Please leave a message.</i>

422
00:28:06,658 --> 00:28:10,410
Hi. I'm working late.
I just wanted to say...

423
00:28:12,968 --> 00:28:14,568
..I'm lucky to have you.

424
00:28:19,408 --> 00:28:20,728
See you when I get home.

425
00:28:28,401 --> 00:28:29,623
Steve.

426
00:28:30,488 --> 00:28:33,768
- There's really no point you being here.
- I know.

427
00:28:36,995 --> 00:28:40,968
<i>My lady, the prosecution applies
for public interest immunity</i>

428
00:28:40,968 --> 00:28:44,776
in order that Detective Sergeant
Arnott be exempted from testifying

429
00:28:44,775 --> 00:28:46,255
in respect of this matter.

430
00:28:46,255 --> 00:28:50,175
Disclosures of covert tactics
in open court will undermine

431
00:28:50,175 --> 00:28:52,855
current and future
police operations.

432
00:28:53,075 --> 00:28:56,425
Detective Sergeant Arnott conducted
an undercover investigation that

433
00:28:56,426 --> 00:28:59,826
was, and is, of
the utmost sensitivity.

434
00:28:59,826 --> 00:29:03,100
Some of this evidence was
the subject of the defendant's

435
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:07,446
successful appeal to be retried
for her original convictions.

436
00:29:09,525 --> 00:29:11,365
The application is refused.

437
00:29:18,805 --> 00:29:20,005
Sorry.

438
00:29:25,285 --> 00:29:28,205
You tried. You're going
to have to face her again.

439
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:35,005
Stand away from the door.

440
00:29:56,465 --> 00:29:57,562
You all right, Jacks?

441
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,497
Yeah, you all right, guv?

442
00:29:59,949 --> 00:30:01,474
Are you feeling OK?

443
00:30:01,589 --> 00:30:02,357
Yeah.

444
00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:07,349
- It's just been a rough couple
of weeks, that's all. - Yeah.

445
00:30:23,149 --> 00:30:24,767
Detective Sergeant Arnott,

446
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:27,069
please would you tell
the court how you came to be

447
00:30:27,094 --> 00:30:30,243
involved in the investigation
surrounding the defendant?

448
00:30:30,244 --> 00:30:33,244
I was and still am
a serving detective in AC-12.

449
00:30:33,244 --> 00:30:37,444
On September 5, 2013,
there was an attempt on the life

450
00:30:37,444 --> 00:30:40,484
of a protected witness,
John Thomas Hunter.

451
00:30:40,484 --> 00:30:42,044
A police convoy was ambushed,

452
00:30:42,044 --> 00:30:44,484
causing the deaths
of three police officers.

453
00:30:44,484 --> 00:30:48,354
AC-12 was assigned to investigate
the possibility of police complicity

454
00:30:48,354 --> 00:30:50,554
in the conspiracy
to assassinate Hunter

455
00:30:50,864 --> 00:30:53,683
and our enquiries focused on
the officer who led the convoy

456
00:30:53,683 --> 00:30:55,251
and was the sole survivor.

457
00:30:55,252 --> 00:30:58,072
And this officer was the defendant?

458
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,298
Yes.

459
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,367
Former Detective Inspector
Lindsay Denton.

460
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,820
Thank you.

461
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,426
Detective Sergeant Arnott,

462
00:31:12,425 --> 00:31:15,485
did you give evidence at
the defendant's original trial?

463
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,383
Yes, I did.

464
00:31:16,383 --> 00:31:20,423
Was there any significant evidence
discovered at the defendant's home?

465
00:31:20,423 --> 00:31:22,223
A hidden sum of cash was found.

466
00:31:22,223 --> 00:31:24,568
Found where exactly?

467
00:31:24,627 --> 00:31:27,947
In some items belonging to
the defendant's late mother.

468
00:31:27,947 --> 00:31:30,416
Specifically the overnight case.

469
00:31:31,267 --> 00:31:34,067
How did that make its way
to the defendant's bedroom?

470
00:31:34,067 --> 00:31:35,707
I carried it up for her.

471
00:31:35,707 --> 00:31:36,787
Why?

472
00:31:36,787 --> 00:31:38,907
I was carrying out
an undercover operation

473
00:31:38,907 --> 00:31:40,547
to investigate the defendant.

474
00:31:40,547 --> 00:31:43,987
And who authorised
this undercover operation?

475
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:46,427
My commanding officer,
Superintendant Hastings.

476
00:31:46,427 --> 00:31:47,627
When?

477
00:31:47,627 --> 00:31:50,027
The operation was
authorised retroactively.

478
00:31:50,027 --> 00:31:52,667
After you carried the case
belonging to the defendant's

479
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:54,987
late mother up to the bedroom,
what did you do?

480
00:31:54,987 --> 00:31:57,387
I offered my sympathies
and I turned the conversation

481
00:31:57,387 --> 00:32:01,667
towards the events surrounding the
conspiracy to murder Tommy Hunter.

482
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:03,867
Did you ever spend a night at
the defendant's house.

483
00:32:03,867 --> 00:32:04,979
No, I did not.

484
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,467
Part of a night?

485
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,428
Yes.

486
00:32:08,827 --> 00:32:10,186
Until what time?

487
00:32:10,787 --> 00:32:13,027
Three, four in the morning.

488
00:32:13,027 --> 00:32:15,849
If you are unsure of
the exact time, Detective Sergeant,

489
00:32:15,874 --> 00:32:17,546
you may refer to your pocketbook.

490
00:32:20,053 --> 00:32:21,794
You did record in your pocketbook

491
00:32:21,794 --> 00:32:23,821
every time you stayed
with the defendant?

492
00:32:23,821 --> 00:32:25,861
No. I was undercover.

493
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:27,061
If she sneaked a look at it,

494
00:32:27,061 --> 00:32:29,141
she would have found out
what I was up to.

495
00:32:29,141 --> 00:32:30,489
What were you doing
with the defendant

496
00:32:30,489 --> 00:32:32,774
until three or four in the morning?

497
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:33,589
Talking.

498
00:32:33,771 --> 00:32:37,011
My undercover operation was designed
to win the defendant's trust.

499
00:32:37,011 --> 00:32:41,614
You were endeavouring to create
a close personal relationship

500
00:32:41,639 --> 00:32:43,279
<i>- with the defendant.
- No.</i>

501
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,919
<i>Only to create the appearance
of a close relationship.</i>

502
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:46,999
I was working.

503
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:49,589
Are there any specific
operational rules

504
00:32:49,614 --> 00:32:51,399
associated with
an undercover operation

505
00:32:51,398 --> 00:32:54,119
<i>with respect to the closeness
of such a relationship?</i>

506
00:32:54,144 --> 00:32:57,318
- Yes.
- Would a sexual relationship

507
00:32:57,343 --> 00:32:59,943
be acceptable during
an undercover operation?

508
00:32:59,943 --> 00:33:01,639
Under current guidelines, no.

509
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:03,951
Was that the reason you didn't seek

510
00:33:03,976 --> 00:33:06,350
authorisation for your
undercover operation?

511
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,350
My lady, we've already established

512
00:33:08,349 --> 00:33:11,347
that the operation was
authorised retrospectively.

513
00:33:11,347 --> 00:33:12,787
Move on, Miss Hepburn.

514
00:33:15,468 --> 00:33:19,588
How many times were you alone
with the defendant in her home?

515
00:33:19,588 --> 00:33:20,860
About a dozen.

516
00:33:21,228 --> 00:33:24,188
At this time, was the case
against the defendant going well?

517
00:33:24,188 --> 00:33:25,298
It was work in progress.

518
00:33:25,298 --> 00:33:27,830
But you needed a key piece
of evidence to crack the case.

519
00:33:27,864 --> 00:33:30,777
My job is to find
any and all evidence.

520
00:33:30,777 --> 00:33:33,415
Would you please remind the court...

521
00:33:34,438 --> 00:33:35,838
who found the cash?

522
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:37,199
A forensic search team.

523
00:33:37,199 --> 00:33:38,359
Led by whom?

524
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:42,719
Me.

525
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:47,639
<i>No further questions.</i>

526
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:02,144
Is it true?

527
00:34:02,719 --> 00:34:04,014
- What?
- Don't.

528
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:07,479
No.

529
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,679
I didn't have sex with her.

530
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,479
- But?
- But nothing.

531
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:16,039
- Nothing?
- No.

532
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:18,867
Right.

533
00:34:19,279 --> 00:34:22,182
We've both had relationships,
you just as much as me,

534
00:34:22,182 --> 00:34:23,844
and I don't dredge up
your old boyfriends.

535
00:34:23,844 --> 00:34:25,987
- None of them were suspects.
- It was before we met.

536
00:34:26,203 --> 00:34:28,570
You're protesting a lot for
someone who didn't shag her.

537
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,190
Because I did stuff back then.

538
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,004
I'm different now.

539
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,290
I only want to be with you.

540
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:44,770
We good?

541
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,290
Yeah.

542
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:55,922
I can guarantee you 110% that none
of my people would plant evidence.

543
00:34:55,947 --> 00:34:57,920
They know I would
throw the book at them,

544
00:34:58,107 --> 00:35:00,187
followed by the bookshelf.

545
00:35:00,187 --> 00:35:01,384
I know you would, Ted.

546
00:35:01,384 --> 00:35:03,570
Maybe this will cheer you up.

547
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,319
Peace offering.

548
00:35:05,944 --> 00:35:07,784
An unredacted file on Ronan Murphy,

549
00:35:07,784 --> 00:35:10,316
the suspect shot dead
by Danny Waldron.

550
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,560
I have been shifting
heaven and earth.

551
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,800
Now you don't have to.

552
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,984
Thank you, Gill.
Thank you very, very much.

553
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:21,834
Ted, people are gunning for AC-12.

554
00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:23,017
I'm just trying to make sure

555
00:35:23,017 --> 00:35:25,345
they get as little
ammunition as possible.

556
00:35:26,017 --> 00:35:28,638
Well, I appreciate
your efforts, of course.

557
00:35:29,177 --> 00:35:30,737
I've got a table booked across town.

558
00:35:30,737 --> 00:35:34,057
A girlfriend's cancelled on me,
if you want to take the edge off.

559
00:35:35,297 --> 00:35:36,970
Erm...

560
00:35:37,457 --> 00:35:39,756
No, I think I'd better
go home to the wife.

561
00:35:42,617 --> 00:35:44,017
But thanks for the file.

562
00:36:27,697 --> 00:36:29,457
Is this really the way
you want it to go?

563
00:36:29,802 --> 00:36:32,002
Hari and Jackie are leading
you up the garden path.

564
00:36:32,002 --> 00:36:32,813
Nobody's doing nothing.

565
00:36:32,813 --> 00:36:35,453
This was a new posting for me
and look what I've walked into.

566
00:36:35,453 --> 00:36:37,455
- It's doing my head in, mate.
- How do you think I'm feeling?

567
00:36:37,455 --> 00:36:39,495
It must be ten times worse for you.

568
00:36:39,904 --> 00:36:41,954
You'd think better of Jackie,
wouldn't you?

569
00:36:43,024 --> 00:36:44,313
The little looks,

570
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,304
the waterworks.

571
00:36:46,711 --> 00:36:48,815
If I can see there's something
going on between you two,

572
00:36:48,816 --> 00:36:49,690
I can't be the only one.

573
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:52,127
You're just putting two and two
together and coming up with 400.

574
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,127
First one to come clean to AC-12,

575
00:36:54,722 --> 00:36:56,659
they always get off the lightest.

576
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,828
If it isn't going to be you
then maybe it'll be me.

577
00:37:02,615 --> 00:37:04,418
What did he say before he died?

578
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:07,648
- I don't know. I couldn't work it out.
- Bollocks.

579
00:37:08,335 --> 00:37:10,655
Let's just say,
I know what's going on.

580
00:37:12,415 --> 00:37:14,495
This won't just be
your career up the spout,

581
00:37:14,495 --> 00:37:16,668
this'll be a long stint inside.

582
00:37:17,095 --> 00:37:19,689
Plenty of time to wonder
if covering for Hari and Jackie

583
00:37:19,714 --> 00:37:21,303
was your smartest move.

584
00:37:21,669 --> 00:37:24,269
And prison's such
a lovely place for a copper.

585
00:37:47,029 --> 00:37:48,555
Hari.

586
00:37:49,673 --> 00:37:52,273
All right, bud.
Give a bloke some peace, will you?

587
00:37:52,273 --> 00:37:53,314
This is getting out of hand.

588
00:37:53,633 --> 00:37:55,099
We need to talk.

589
00:37:55,433 --> 00:37:57,662
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

590
00:37:57,687 --> 00:37:59,197
Not here, though, all right? I'll...

591
00:37:59,197 --> 00:38:01,117
I'll figure out a place and a time.

592
00:38:02,157 --> 00:38:03,317
Yeah?

593
00:38:21,797 --> 00:38:22,934
Yeah.

594
00:38:23,237 --> 00:38:25,517
Sir, I've got all the forensics
in on Linus Murphy.

595
00:38:25,517 --> 00:38:26,557
And?

596
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,918
The head's been formally
identified as Linus Murphy's

597
00:38:30,918 --> 00:38:32,638
based on DNA and dental records,

598
00:38:32,638 --> 00:38:35,420
and matched to the body found
at Linus Murphy's address.

599
00:38:35,445 --> 00:38:37,282
Forensic examination of the head

600
00:38:37,307 --> 00:38:39,986
has also provided the missing
link to Danny Waldron.

601
00:38:40,383 --> 00:38:43,018
Cells in the mouth
that match Waldron's DNA.

602
00:38:43,383 --> 00:38:44,731
Cells?

603
00:38:45,426 --> 00:38:46,799
Semen cells.

604
00:38:51,096 --> 00:38:54,077
Well, now we know why he wanted
to chop the head off.

605
00:38:55,462 --> 00:38:58,735
Well, you did right to question
Waldron's private life.

606
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:01,072
Mind you,

607
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:04,592
never had the man
pegged as a homosexual.

608
00:39:04,867 --> 00:39:07,347
I'm not sure that's
necessarily true, sir.

609
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:11,943
The unredacted file on Ronan Murphy.

610
00:39:12,187 --> 00:39:13,398
Thank you, sir.

611
00:39:14,913 --> 00:39:17,310
I haven't read anything in it
that changes my understanding

612
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:19,670
of anything but take it away with
you, you might find something.

613
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,898
- On you go.
- Sir.

614
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,591
What's that, then?

615
00:39:41,591 --> 00:39:44,242
Gaffer finally got us
the file on Ronan Murphy.

616
00:39:44,241 --> 00:39:45,776
Dead end.

617
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:40,020
'Ey up, buddy.
How's it going, then? You all right?

618
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:43,530
I don't know about you, but I
ain't slept in God knows how long.

619
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:44,570
Yeah, I know.

620
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:48,130
Just trying not to
show it to the missus.

621
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:52,050
It's horrible, isn't it?

622
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:55,439
But it's the only way of getting
through to the other side.

623
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,290
What other side?

624
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:00,298
Well, AC-12 dropping
the investigation.

625
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:03,210
Going back to work and that.

626
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,330
Like nothing ever happened, eh?

627
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,890
Well, no, I didn't
mean it like that, did I?

628
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:14,635
Look...

629
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,302
..I've been talking to my rep

630
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,350
and the legal adviser.

631
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:23,452
I ain't told them anything.

632
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,268
I need this job.

633
00:41:28,098 --> 00:41:30,858
I need my pension. People are
putting two and two together.

634
00:41:30,858 --> 00:41:32,664
Wait, what are you on about?
What people?

635
00:41:32,938 --> 00:41:35,235
Danny managed to say something.

636
00:41:36,138 --> 00:41:37,319
Kate knows what happened.

637
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,237
- Yeah, but how can she, though?
- I don't know.

638
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:45,030
I don't know. But if anyone's
in the frame, it's me.

639
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,190
Listen, mate, look,
it's like I said...

640
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:51,070
If Kate knows about me
and Jackie and Danny...

641
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,630
I've got to come clean to AC-12.

642
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,430
The longer I leave it,
the worse it looks.

643
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:57,804
Mate, I've got a little 'un
and another one on the way.

644
00:41:57,829 --> 00:42:00,349
It wasn't my idea to
lie through our teeth!

645
00:42:00,349 --> 00:42:02,221
Yeah, but we had to lie,
though, didn't we?

646
00:42:02,267 --> 00:42:05,204
Cos the truth makes us sound guilty,
and we're not guilty, are we?

647
00:42:05,448 --> 00:42:07,001
It was us or him, wasn't it?

648
00:42:07,448 --> 00:42:08,843
It wasn't us.

649
00:42:09,208 --> 00:42:10,754
It was you!

650
00:42:18,568 --> 00:42:19,888
Look where it's got us.

651
00:42:21,768 --> 00:42:23,463
A career up the spout.

652
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,504
A stint inside?

653
00:42:32,342 --> 00:42:34,182
Be a great place for a copper.

654
00:42:51,516 --> 00:42:53,876
The defence calls Lindsay Denton.

655
00:43:06,038 --> 00:43:08,718
I do solemnly, sincerely
and truly declare and affirm

656
00:43:08,718 --> 00:43:10,238
that the evidence I shall give

657
00:43:10,238 --> 00:43:12,358
will be the truth, the whole truth

658
00:43:12,787 --> 00:43:14,467
and nothing but the truth.

659
00:43:22,047 --> 00:43:25,976
Miss Denton, last year you
were convicted in this court

660
00:43:25,976 --> 00:43:28,696
because 10 out of 12 jurors were
sure you'd conspired

661
00:43:28,696 --> 00:43:31,496
in the murder of
a protected witness,

662
00:43:31,496 --> 00:43:33,243
John Thomas Hunter.

663
00:43:33,816 --> 00:43:38,229
Would you tell this jury whether
you were guilty of that crime?

664
00:43:38,896 --> 00:43:39,934
No.

665
00:43:40,376 --> 00:43:43,256
I had nothing to do with
the murder of Tommy Hunter.

666
00:43:44,736 --> 00:43:47,016
We've heard from
Detective Sergeant Arnott

667
00:43:47,016 --> 00:43:49,570
that one important item
of evidence against you

668
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:54,610
was a sum of approximately
£50,000 in cash found at your home.

669
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:58,010
To the best of your knowledge,
how was that evidence found?

670
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:01,930
I have full knowledge of how it was
found, as I was present at the time.

671
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:06,010
Detective Constable Kate Fleming
led me upstairs where a team of

672
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:09,530
forensic scene investigators,
led by Detective Sergeant Arnott,

673
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:11,932
were in the process
of searching my bedroom.

674
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:15,889
Detective Sergeant Arnott
remarked upon the fact I'd shown

675
00:44:15,914 --> 00:44:18,554
a peculiar interest in
my mum's personal belongings.

676
00:44:18,554 --> 00:44:20,194
Peculiar? In what way?

677
00:44:20,194 --> 00:44:23,314
Detective Sergeant Arnott remarked
that I'd been particularly anxious

678
00:44:23,314 --> 00:44:25,546
about Mum's things
not being returned to me.

679
00:44:25,546 --> 00:44:26,595
Were you?

680
00:44:26,986 --> 00:44:30,383
I was devastated by her death.

681
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:33,194
The thought of them being
lost was heartbreaking.

682
00:44:33,799 --> 00:44:37,772
I kept them in that room
and I didn't even touch them.

683
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,107
I didn't even try to move them.
I just...

684
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:43,644
As long as they were there...

685
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,679
..somehow it felt to me
that my mum was there.

686
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:55,783
Are you OK to carry on, Miss Denton?

687
00:45:00,959 --> 00:45:02,199
Yes.

688
00:45:02,437 --> 00:45:04,732
You were recalling that
Detective Sergeant Arnott

689
00:45:04,757 --> 00:45:06,623
was leading a forensic search.

690
00:45:06,623 --> 00:45:11,338
He asked one of the forensic search
team to open Mum's overnight case.

691
00:45:11,338 --> 00:45:13,555
And what was found in the case?

692
00:45:13,975 --> 00:45:16,102
A large number of banknotes.

693
00:45:16,615 --> 00:45:19,415
Had you ever seen
these banknotes before?

694
00:45:19,415 --> 00:45:20,383
Never.

695
00:45:20,655 --> 00:45:22,095
How did you react?

696
00:45:22,095 --> 00:45:24,960
I was astonished, devastated,

697
00:45:25,415 --> 00:45:26,623
confused.

698
00:45:26,895 --> 00:45:31,098
And how did
Detective Sergeant Arnott react?

699
00:45:31,855 --> 00:45:33,063
He didn't bat an eye.

700
00:45:33,415 --> 00:45:35,230
He didn't seem surprised?

701
00:45:35,655 --> 00:45:38,072
Or curious or triumphant?

702
00:45:38,415 --> 00:45:39,442
No.

703
00:45:39,775 --> 00:45:42,055
How would you describe
your relationship with

704
00:45:42,055 --> 00:45:44,724
Detective Sergeant Arnott
up until that point?

705
00:45:44,904 --> 00:45:46,695
I thought we'd become friends.

706
00:45:46,695 --> 00:45:48,655
You became close?

707
00:45:50,015 --> 00:45:50,917
Yeah.

708
00:45:51,335 --> 00:45:54,695
An undercover officer is
forbidden from sexual relations

709
00:45:54,695 --> 00:45:56,661
with a person that
they are investigating.

710
00:45:56,662 --> 00:46:01,058
My lady, the investigating officer's
relationship with the defendant

711
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:05,843
has no bearing on the abundant
and powerful evidence against her.

712
00:46:05,843 --> 00:46:09,721
My lady, an undercover officer
must abide by a code of conduct.

713
00:46:09,721 --> 00:46:11,641
Failure to follow
that code of conduct

714
00:46:11,641 --> 00:46:14,288
implies that there are other rules
he might be prepared to break.

715
00:46:14,288 --> 00:46:16,119
I'll allow the question.

716
00:46:21,927 --> 00:46:25,773
While undercover
and investigating you...

717
00:46:26,207 --> 00:46:30,097
did Steve Arnott engage in sexual
relations with you?

718
00:46:34,421 --> 00:46:36,758
On how many occasions?

719
00:46:38,741 --> 00:46:40,101
Once.

720
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:44,588
I was very vulnerable.

721
00:46:46,005 --> 00:46:49,441
Following my mum's death. And, eh...

722
00:46:49,885 --> 00:46:53,251
he seemed like the only person
in the world who understood...

723
00:46:53,276 --> 00:46:56,321
what I was going through. Sorry.

724
00:46:57,583 --> 00:47:02,335
And, as a police officer,
what conclusion did you

725
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,800
draw from that regarding Steve
Arnott's relationship with you?

726
00:47:05,799 --> 00:47:09,196
That, as sexual relations
are forbidden,

727
00:47:09,221 --> 00:47:12,661
he couldn't be undercover or
investigating me any more.

728
00:47:12,661 --> 00:47:16,981
How many times was
Steve Arnott in your house?

729
00:47:16,981 --> 00:47:20,898
- I'd say a dozen. <i>- But you were always
there at the same time, weren't you?</i>

730
00:47:20,898 --> 00:47:24,098
I wasn't sleeping very well
at night, sometimes I would

731
00:47:24,098 --> 00:47:26,138
doze off on the sofa and wake up,

732
00:47:26,138 --> 00:47:28,738
and a couple of hours
would have gone by.

733
00:47:28,738 --> 00:47:31,338
And he'd been there the whole time?

734
00:47:31,338 --> 00:47:35,178
- Yeah. - But you had no idea
where in the house he had been

735
00:47:35,178 --> 00:47:36,738
or what he had been doing?

736
00:47:38,018 --> 00:47:42,329
- No. - With access to your late
mother's belongings?

737
00:47:45,181 --> 00:47:46,054
Yeah.

738
00:47:47,894 --> 00:47:49,810
Thank you, Miss Denton.

739
00:47:55,173 --> 00:47:59,787
- My Lady. - Yes, let's leave it
there for today. <i>- All rise.</i>

740
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,500
DS Arnott...

741
00:48:52,773 --> 00:48:53,973
Shut the door.

742
00:48:57,678 --> 00:48:58,959
Remain standing.

743
00:49:00,234 --> 00:49:02,421
Did you have sexual relations
with a suspect

744
00:49:02,446 --> 00:49:04,216
you were investigating
whilst undercover?

745
00:49:04,216 --> 00:49:06,374
Lindsay Denton is going to say
anything to con the jury.

746
00:49:06,374 --> 00:49:09,553
- Did you or didn't you?
- No, sir, I did not.

747
00:49:10,803 --> 00:49:13,734
- If that's your answer...
- It is my answer, sir.

748
00:49:17,332 --> 00:49:18,782
She claims that
when the money was found,

749
00:49:18,782 --> 00:49:20,551
you didn't bat an eye -
is that correct?

750
00:49:20,942 --> 00:49:23,788
- Yes.
- Why would that be, now?

751
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:25,892
The search team had established
the find

752
00:49:25,892 --> 00:49:28,041
prior to Denton entering
the premises.

753
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:31,732
I ordered them to simulate making
the find in front of her.

754
00:49:31,732 --> 00:49:33,212
To see her reaction.

755
00:49:34,212 --> 00:49:37,961
You make the find, you show her -
there's your reaction there.

756
00:49:37,986 --> 00:49:40,266
- You were showboating!
- Yes, sir.

757
00:49:40,266 --> 00:49:41,840
I will give you "yes, sir".

758
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,240
The defence are using this to
discredit your work

759
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,960
and the work of this department!

760
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,640
Your team was bossing the game,
you went and gave away a penalty!

761
00:49:50,165 --> 00:49:52,205
Get the hell out of here!

762
00:50:02,788 --> 00:50:04,388
Superintendent Hastings.

763
00:50:16,148 --> 00:50:17,508
Sir.

764
00:50:17,508 --> 00:50:18,948
Sir.

765
00:50:24,828 --> 00:50:26,188
Mother of God.

766
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:43,313
Who's in charge here?

767
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:46,439
<i>I want a preview of the forensics...</i>

768
00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:53,185
It is with deep regret
that I inform you all...

769
00:50:54,228 --> 00:50:56,228
..of the death of PC Rod Kennedy.

770
00:50:57,388 --> 00:51:00,668
Rod's body was found
hanged at an industrial unit.

771
00:51:00,668 --> 00:51:03,440
Early indications
are that he took his own life.

772
00:51:04,184 --> 00:51:06,319
There will be a book
of condolence in the squad room

773
00:51:06,344 --> 00:51:09,024
and we will send out the necessary
information for those of you

774
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:11,384
who want to send flowers, cards...

775
00:51:35,463 --> 00:51:36,823
Is there anything I can do?

776
00:51:39,704 --> 00:51:41,064
It'll be fine.

777
00:51:44,104 --> 00:51:45,344
Here.

778
00:51:55,544 --> 00:51:57,801
Did you have any idea he would do
something like that?

779
00:51:58,264 --> 00:51:59,624
Did you?

780
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:07,224
This has gone too far.

781
00:52:18,464 --> 00:52:21,584
- We need to talk.
- Jackie, it's late.

782
00:52:21,584 --> 00:52:23,144
I'm not leaving.

783
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:45,589
- Everything all right?
- I was going to ask you the same thing.

784
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:50,024
Kate, I read your report.
You had nothing on Rod Kennedy.

785
00:52:51,984 --> 00:52:54,949
The last thing that Danny said to me
before he died was "listen".

786
00:52:55,322 --> 00:52:57,122
And that was all he could get out.

787
00:52:57,122 --> 00:52:59,214
You weren't to know how bad
he would fall for the bluff.

788
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:01,348
That's why I'm asking if you're OK.

789
00:53:01,782 --> 00:53:03,280
Just doing my job, mate.

790
00:53:19,382 --> 00:53:20,971
Well done, Kate.

791
00:53:29,942 --> 00:53:31,462
Rod and I were involved.

792
00:53:33,822 --> 00:53:35,262
An affair?

793
00:53:36,222 --> 00:53:40,022
Between two armed officers
serving side by side?

794
00:53:40,022 --> 00:53:43,724
That is a serious
lack of professionalism, Constable.

795
00:53:44,298 --> 00:53:45,438
Yes, sir.

796
00:53:46,751 --> 00:53:48,455
We had to keep
the relationship hidden

797
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,063
or we would both have been disciplined.

798
00:53:50,063 --> 00:53:53,020
And were you still involved with Rod Kennedy
at the time of his death?

799
00:53:53,045 --> 00:53:56,285
No. We had broken up
a couple of months before.

800
00:53:56,285 --> 00:53:57,365
Why?

801
00:54:02,805 --> 00:54:04,767
Something happened between
me and Danny.

802
00:54:04,767 --> 00:54:06,671
What happened between you and Danny?

803
00:54:08,886 --> 00:54:10,726
It was a one-night thing.

804
00:54:13,006 --> 00:54:17,201
Rod found out about it.
Him and Danny had a bust-up.

805
00:54:17,201 --> 00:54:18,441
Danny was...

806
00:54:20,601 --> 00:54:23,281
Danny was in the habit
of making remarks.

807
00:54:24,521 --> 00:54:28,441
Undermining Rod. Rod was really
jealous, he couldn't handle it.

808
00:54:28,837 --> 00:54:30,820
Why did Danny Waldron
draw his firearm?

809
00:54:30,972 --> 00:54:34,252
I don't know. I mean,
we didn't do anything.

810
00:54:34,252 --> 00:54:38,554
There was nothing to suggest
he was in any kind of danger.

811
00:54:40,115 --> 00:54:44,208
So I can only imagine
he was spooked by summat.

812
00:54:48,528 --> 00:54:49,728
Go on.

813
00:54:50,835 --> 00:54:52,887
And that's when Rod went for him.

814
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,897
Rod grabbed Danny's gun
and the two of them

815
00:54:56,897 --> 00:54:58,457
started wrestling with it.

816
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:02,137
And me and Victor Charlie 53,

817
00:55:02,137 --> 00:55:03,937
we tried to get it off them both.

818
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:10,703
- And that's when it went off.
- So let's be perfectly clear, Constable.

819
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:13,511
You are now declaring

820
00:55:14,062 --> 00:55:17,621
that PC Rod Kennedy killed
Sergeant Daniel Waldron?

821
00:55:18,021 --> 00:55:19,346
Yes, sir.

822
00:55:23,534 --> 00:55:24,854
Rod killed Danny.

823
00:55:26,121 --> 00:55:27,561
Rod killed Danny.

824
00:55:39,449 --> 00:55:42,185
Oldest trick in the book -
blame the dead bloke.

825
00:55:42,185 --> 00:55:46,105
He killed himself, though. Fits
with him being the guilty party.

826
00:55:46,105 --> 00:55:48,915
First there were three of them
sticking together, now there's two.

827
00:55:49,381 --> 00:55:52,112
I've said it before
and I'll say it again.

828
00:55:53,046 --> 00:55:56,056
Catching criminals is tough enough,
but catching coppers?

829
00:55:56,056 --> 00:55:57,776
God give me strength.

830
00:55:59,576 --> 00:56:03,090
We keep going, fellas.
We keep going.

831
00:56:04,136 --> 00:56:05,181
Sir.

832
00:56:06,256 --> 00:56:07,616
Sir.

833
00:56:34,256 --> 00:56:38,476
- Hello?
<i>- Bin the previous phone. Use this one for now.</i>

834
00:56:38,501 --> 00:56:40,529
<i>You will have a new one
in a couple of days.</i>

835
00:56:43,281 --> 00:56:45,170
I made one mistake, man.

836
00:56:48,081 --> 00:56:52,258
- One mistake and you keep making me pay.
<i>- AC-12 went for it?</i>

837
00:56:53,507 --> 00:56:55,627
- Yeah.
<i>- Don't be modest.</i>

838
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:57,927
I heard you played them
like violins.

839
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:06,280
I had no prior information.

840
00:57:06,577 --> 00:57:07,617
of the operation.

841
00:57:07,616 --> 00:57:11,516
I had no prior information...of the
operation to move Tommy Hunter.

842
00:57:11,541 --> 00:57:13,775
No prior information. No prior...

843
00:57:13,774 --> 00:57:16,198
No prior knowledge,
I had no prior knowledge.

844
00:57:16,534 --> 00:57:20,014
I had no prior knowledge of the
operation to move Tommy Hunter.

845
00:57:24,854 --> 00:57:30,090
Every day I wish it had been
somebody else who'd taken that call.

846
00:57:32,014 --> 00:57:35,091
Somebody else
who had to...

847
00:57:35,391 --> 00:57:39,778
stand by and watch as their...

848
00:57:40,672 --> 00:57:42,352
..fellow officers...

849
00:57:46,202 --> 00:57:47,642
..were gunned down...

850
00:57:50,242 --> 00:57:52,082
..and set alight.

851
00:58:11,075 --> 00:58:15,122
I had no prior knowledge
of the operation.

852
00:58:15,498 --> 00:58:17,618
No prior knowledge at all.

853
00:58:18,305 --> 00:59:18,474

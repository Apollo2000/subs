<font color="yellow">I think it's going to be</font>
<font color="yellow">very difficult</font>

There's a growing army
of younger people

10
00:00:34,249 --> 00:00:36,170
looking for work or a new life.

11
00:00:36,209 --> 00:00:38,569
What they need is a secure home
and a job,

12
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,609
but often, they're denied either.

13
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,050
<font color="yellow">The first thing that they find</font>

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,649
<font color="yellow">is that London isn't what it</font>
<font color="yellow">appears to be on television.</font>

15
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,289
They've often deliberately
cut all links with the past,

16
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,050
and this makes them an easy target

17
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,690
for exploitation
by criminals or conmen.

Look, I...

..I know you're trying
to be a good friend to Carol,

It's crazy.

41
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:41,250
Whatever happened
between me and her,

59
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,250
OK. If he calls again,

<font color="#008000">it had gone.</font>

66
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:30,890
Could it have unblocked itself?
<font color="#008000">No way.</font>

67
00:04:30,929 --> 00:04:32,890
<font color="#008000">You'd have to get in there</font>

Do you know how far
the blockage goes up?

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,689
<font color="#008000">About halfway.</font>
<font color="#008000">But the middle flat's unoccupied,</font>

72
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:49,489

Well,
let's get them down to pathology,

81
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,410
confirm they're human.

Dennis Nilsen, I'm arresting you
on the suspicion of murder.

107
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:25,169
You do not have to say anything,
unless you wish to do so,

108
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,570
but what you do say
may be given in evidence.

109
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,210
Don't let anyone up there
until the pathologist gets here.

110
00:07:47,929 --> 00:07:50,530

<font color="yellow">15 or 16... I think.</font>

00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,049
<font color="#008000">So, what do we know?</font>

113
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,770
<font color="cyan">At least one victim.</font>

114
00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:26,729

Going by the smell in the flat,
I'd say there were a lot more.

00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,330
<font color="#008000">There's no actual evidence</font>

It's off limits till morning.
Too damp. We've secured the scene,

119
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:40,450

124
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,129
<font color="#008000">we're gonna have the eyes</font>

00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,649
<font color="#008000">What do you reckon?</font>

128
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:09,210
I think we're gonna get a lot more
bees with honey than with vinegar.

00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,769
<font color="#008000">There,</font>
<font color="#008000">they found the remains of a man.</font>

137
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,810
<font color="#008000">Do you want to explain that?</font>

138
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:46,889
<font color="yellow">In what context?</font>

139
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,729
<font color="#008000">How did it get there?</font>

140
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:52,649
<font color="yellow">Have you searched</font>
<font color="yellow">the rest of the flat yet?</font>

141
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,570
<font color="#008000">We're in the process of that</font>
<font color="#008000">as we speak.</font>

142
00:09:54,609 --> 00:09:59,050
<font color="yellow">You'll find more in the, er,</font>
<font color="yellow">tea chest in my bedroom,</font>

143
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:02,850
<font color="yellow">and in the turned-up drawer</font>
<font color="yellow">in my bathroom.</font>

144
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:04,649
<font color="yellow">All in all,</font>
<font color="yellow">the remains of three people.</font>

145
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,369
In the car,
you said that there was more.

146
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:11,609
<font color="cyan">I must advise my client...</font>
<font color="yellow">195 Melrose Avenue, N2.</font>

147
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:16,649
<font color="yellow">There, you'll find the remains of 12</font>
<font color="yellow">or 13 people dating back to 1978.</font>

148
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,690
<font color="yellow">It's actually a relief</font>
<font color="yellow">to get this off my chest.</font>

149
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:29,930
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

150
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:43,850
<font color="#008000">Who do all these remains belong to?</font>

151
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:46,850
<font color="cyan">I need a moment with my client...</font>
<font color="yellow">It's OK. Er...</font>

152
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:49,930
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid I don't remember</font>
<font color="yellow">their names.</font>

153
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,649
<font color="#008000">None of them? </font><font color="yellow">Well, at the time,</font>
<font color="yellow">I'd only just met them.</font>

154
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,249
<font color="#008000">Where did you meet them?</font>

155
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,409
<font color="yellow">All over. Bars, on the street.</font>

156
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,409
<font color="yellow">Some, I just wanted to give a meal.</font>

157
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,369
<font color="yellow">London can be a lonely place</font>
<font color="yellow">sometimes.</font>

158
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:06,690
<font color="yellow">A friendly face goes a long way.</font>
<font color="#008000">So, they were homeless?</font>

159
00:11:06,729 --> 00:11:08,850
<font color="yellow">Er... some.</font>

160
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:11,009
<font color="yellow">Because of the drugs, usually.</font>

161
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,409
<font color="yellow">It really is a disease,</font>
<font color="yellow">it's very sad. And, you know,</font>

162
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,529
<font color="yellow">this bloody government</font>
<font color="yellow">does nothing for them.</font>

163
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,489
<font color="#008000">Were they all male?</font>
<font color="yellow">Aye.</font>

164
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:21,729
<font color="#008000">How old were they?</font>

165
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:24,810
<font color="yellow">Well, some looked younger</font>
<font color="yellow">than others. Erm...</font>

166
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,850
<font color="yellow">Sorry, I'm not being very helpful.</font>
<font color="#008000">No, you're doing fine.</font>

167
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,369
<font color="#008000">How did you kill them?</font>

168
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:32,210
<font color="yellow">I strangled them.</font>

169
00:11:32,249 --> 00:11:35,450
<font color="#008000">Where did these murders take place?</font>
<font color="yellow">In my house.</font>

170
00:11:35,489 --> 00:11:37,450
<font color="yellow">Mostly in my bed, to be specific.</font>

171
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:40,009
<font color="#008000">So, they came home with you</font>
<font color="#008000">willingly? </font><font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

172
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:45,769
Were they all homosexual?
<font color="yellow">I don't remember asking them.</font>

173
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,249
Are you homosexual, Mr Nilsen?

174
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,889
<font color="yellow">Well, er...</font>
<font color="yellow">for the sake of convenience,</font>

175
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,090
<font color="yellow">you should probably class me</font>
<font color="yellow">as homosexual.</font>

176
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:58,409
<font color="yellow">If that's actually true,</font>
<font color="yellow">I'm not so sure.</font>

177
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:02,090
<font color="#008000">The three in Cranley Gardens,</font>
<font color="#008000">when did these murders take place?</font>

178
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:05,050
<font color="yellow">The most recent was three weeks ago.</font>

179
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,970
<font color="yellow">Erm...</font>

180
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:09,369
<font color="yellow">The others, last year sometime.</font>

181
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,810
You kept them for a year?

182
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,649
<font color="yellow">Aye.</font>
In pieces?

183
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:20,210
<font color="yellow">No, no. The dissection's</font>
<font color="yellow">merely for disposal.</font>

184
00:12:20,249 --> 00:12:23,850
<font color="yellow">It's the dirty platter</font>
<font color="yellow">after the feast, if you like.</font>

185
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:27,330
<font color="yellow">In Melrose, it was simple</font>
<font color="yellow">cos it was a ground floor flat,</font>

186
00:12:27,369 --> 00:12:29,769
<font color="yellow">so there was space</font>
<font color="yellow">under the floor boards for storage</font>

187
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:33,769
<font color="yellow">and sole access to a garden</font>
<font color="yellow">when a clearance was called for.</font>

188
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,850
<font color="yellow">Yeah, no, I remember it, Melrose,</font>
<font color="yellow">when the bodies began to accumulate,</font>

189
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:40,050
<font color="yellow">I knew there'd be a smell problem.</font>

190
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,729
<font color="yellow">So, at the weekend,</font>
<font color="yellow">I'd take up the floorboards,</font>

191
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:47,850
<font color="yellow">I'd get blinding drunk,</font>
<font color="yellow">so I could face it,</font>

192
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:53,729
<font color="yellow">er, put down sort of black plastic,</font>
<font color="yellow">like a bin liner,</font>

193
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:57,489
<font color="yellow">for the mess,</font>
<font color="yellow">and then I'd start dissection</font>

194
00:12:57,529 --> 00:12:59,450
<font color="yellow">on the kitchen floor.</font>

195
00:12:59,489 --> 00:13:03,290
<font color="yellow">I learnt if you make an incision</font>
<font color="yellow">just below the navel,</font>

196
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,129
<font color="yellow">you can pretty much</font>
<font color="yellow">get to everything</font>

197
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:08,369
<font color="yellow">without having to deal with</font>
<font color="yellow">the rib cage and such.</font>

198
00:13:08,409 --> 00:13:10,570
<font color="yellow">But it was all trial and error.</font>

199
00:13:10,609 --> 00:13:12,529
<font color="#008000">You buried them in the garden?</font>

200
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,489
<font color="yellow">No, I burnt them.</font>

201
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:17,649
<font color="yellow">Erm, I'd wrap them</font>
<font color="yellow">in an old piece of carpet</font>

202
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,690
<font color="yellow">and throw a tyre on top,</font>
<font color="yellow">hide the smell.</font>

203
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:25,810
<font color="yellow">I took no pleasure</font>
<font color="yellow">in cutting up people,</font>

204
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,369
<font color="yellow">or boiling heads, or burning bodies.</font>

205
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,290
<font color="yellow">I did it cos I had to,</font>
<font color="yellow">there was no more space.</font>

206
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,930
How many bodies did you have
in the house at any one time?

207
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:38,330
<font color="yellow">I never did a stock check.</font>

208
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,850
<font color="#008000">Or ask their names, it seems.</font>

209
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:44,810
<font color="yellow">No, no, that I do regret.</font>

210
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,649
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I wish I could remember</font>
<font color="yellow">their names to tell you now.</font>

211
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:48,970
<font color="yellow">I really do.</font>

212
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,090
<font color="cyan">I have to ask...</font>

213
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:54,409
<font color="cyan">why did you do this?</font>

214
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,930
<font color="yellow">I don't really know. Erm...</font>

215
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:05,330
<font color="yellow">I was rather hoping</font>
<font color="yellow">you could tell me that.</font>

219
00:14:24,969 --> 00:14:25,969
<font color="yellow">With number three,</font>

220
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:28,969
<font color="yellow">he was a young-looking man</font>
<font color="yellow">I picked up at Euston Station.</font>

221
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:31,570
<font color="yellow">I was out on the piss that night,</font>
<font color="yellow">drinking heavily.</font>

222
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:33,810
<font color="yellow">Next morning,</font>
<font color="yellow">he was dead on the floor.</font>

223
00:14:33,849 --> 00:14:36,209
<font color="yellow">I remember bits and pieces.</font>

224
00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:38,050
<font color="yellow">I don't remember any violence</font>
<font color="yellow">at all.</font>

225
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:42,609
<font color="yellow">Whilst drinking in Soho,</font>
<font color="yellow">I got into a conversation</font>

226
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,369
<font color="yellow">with this Scottish guy...</font>
<font color="yellow">Number 11 was a skinhead type,</font>

227
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,290
<font color="yellow">he had "cut here"</font>
<font color="yellow">tattooed on his neck.</font>

228
00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:50,410
<font color="yellow">He was boasting about his toughness,</font>
<font color="yellow">about his hardness.</font>

229
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,129
<font color="yellow">After killing him,</font>
<font color="yellow">I just went to bed.</font>

230
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,969
<font color="yellow">End of day, end of drinking,</font>
<font color="yellow">end of person.</font>

231
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:57,129
<font color="yellow">The 12th was a...</font>

232
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,570
<font color="yellow">I remember being sat on him...</font>

233
00:14:58,609 --> 00:15:01,050
<font color="yellow">"My legs, I can't move my legs."</font>
<font color="yellow">I called him an ambulance.</font>

234
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:04,209
<font color="yellow">Number 14, I made him an omelette,</font>
<font color="yellow">he said he wanted something to eat.</font>

235
00:15:04,249 --> 00:15:06,930
<font color="yellow">If it was the omelette that</font>
<font color="yellow">killed him or me, I'm not so sure,</font>

236
00:15:06,969 --> 00:15:11,329
<font color="yellow">but I don't suppose omelettes</font>
<font color="yellow">leave red marks on a neck, do they?</font>

237
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,089
What do you think, guv?

238
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:25,209
<font color="#008000">I'm thinking there's a lot of words</font>
<font color="#008000">on those pages,</font>

239
00:15:25,249 --> 00:15:27,489
<font color="#008000">but not a lot of concrete evidence.</font>

240
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,249
You think he's lying?

241
00:15:30,489 --> 00:15:33,770
<font color="#008000">About the amount? Possibly.</font>

242
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,810
I dunno, guv. There's something...

243
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,570
I believe him.

244
00:15:40,609 --> 00:15:43,489
<font color="#008000">Well, let's get a victim's name</font>
<font color="#008000">and charge him.</font>

00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,129

00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:36,370
When I got there this morning,
there was a journo

262
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,130
a few doors down
from Cranley Gardens

263
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:41,410
with the drain guy from yesterday.
<font color="cyan">That didn't take him long, did it?</font>

264
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,809
<font color="#008000">Right, media blackout from now on,</font>
<font color="#008000">boys.</font>

265
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:48,890
<font color="#008000">They get nothing from us.</font>
<font color="#008000">Understood? </font>ALL: <font color="yellow">Yes, guv.</font>

266
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,410
<font color="#008000">Last thing we need is an early siege</font>
<font color="#008000">before we charge him.</font>

267
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,610
Er, where are we at
with everything else?

268
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,610
Chris, did you search his office?

269
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,410
<font color="cyan">We weren't allowed to.</font>
What do you mean?

270
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,410
<font color="cyan">His colleagues said</font>
<font color="cyan">they couldn't believe</font>

271
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,009
<font color="cyan">he would do anything like this,</font>
<font color="cyan">and if we wanted to search</font>

272
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:04,809
<font color="cyan">the office,</font>
<font color="cyan">we'd need to get a warrant.</font>

273
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,650
You're kidding me. <font color="#008000">Take down one of</font>
<font color="#008000">the bags we found in his flat,</font>

274
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:10,529
<font color="#008000">maybe that would act as a warrant.</font>
Anything else from the lab?

275
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:13,009
<font color="yellow">Bowen's confirmed strangulation</font>
<font color="yellow">as the cause of death.</font>

276
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:14,130
That was quick.

277
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,049
<font color="yellow">Well, one of the pieces we took down</font>
<font color="yellow">had a ligature mark on it.</font>

278
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:20,249
<font color="#008000">Has he been able to identify anyone?</font>
<font color="yellow">No, not yet.</font>

279
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:23,650
<font color="#008000">So all of this is irrelevant</font>
<font color="#008000">until he gives us a name.</font>

280
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,370
DOOR OPENS,
FOOTSTEPS

281
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,610
<font color="cyan">He used to be a policeman.</font>
<font color="#008000">What?</font>

282
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,209
Where?
<font color="cyan">With the Met.</font>

283
00:19:29,249 --> 00:19:31,410
<font color="cyan">Willesden. Left in '73.</font>

284
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,249
Why did he leave?
<font color="cyan">Nothing on file.</font>

285
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:35,450
<font color="cyan">He just left.</font>

286
00:19:35,489 --> 00:19:37,610
Shit.

287
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,890
<font color="#008000">Are you fucking with us?</font>

288
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,249
<font color="cyan">Mr Chambers...</font>
<font color="#008000">You're ex-police.</font>

289
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:43,410
<font color="#008000">You left that out last night.</font>

290
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,809
<font color="yellow">I didn't mention it</font>
<font color="yellow">cos it's not relevant. </font><font color="#008000">Not relevant?</font>

291
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,890
<font color="yellow">No, I wasn't doing this while</font>
<font color="yellow">I was there, so it's not relevant.</font>

292
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,330
<font color="yellow">Not at the present time, anyhow.</font>

293
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,930
<font color="yellow">It's in nobody's interest</font>
<font color="yellow">for me to lie.</font>

294
00:19:54,969 --> 00:19:57,729
Why did you leave?
<font color="yellow">Homophobia.</font>

295
00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:00,529
<font color="#008000">A name. Right now.</font>

296
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:02,729
<font color="cyan">Mr Nilsen,</font>
<font color="cyan">you don't have to say anything.</font>

297
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:05,650
<font color="yellow">Like I said to you last night,</font>
<font color="yellow">the last one was Scottish,</font>

298
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,969
<font color="yellow">we were saying</font>
<font color="yellow">how shite Scotland is in the winter.</font>

299
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:09,489
<font color="yellow">A Scottish name.</font>

300
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:13,170
<font color="yellow">Stephen. It was Stephen.</font>

301
00:20:13,209 --> 00:20:14,650
Stephen what?

302
00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:19,930
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'm sorry,</font>
<font color="yellow">I really don't remember.</font>

303
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,890
<font color="cyan">I think now would be a good time</font>
<font color="cyan">to pause the interview, anyway.</font>

304
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,450
<font color="yellow">No, let's keep going.</font>

305
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,769
Steve, get me a list of all Stephens
reported missing from Scotland.

306
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:34,610
<font color="cyan">That's gonna be a pretty long list,</font>
<font color="cyan">guv. </font>That's all we got.

307
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,450
Do it.

308
00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:42,090
<font color="yellow">I want to help the officers</font>
<font color="yellow">and the men caught up in my mess.</font>

309
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,489
<font color="cyan">Mr Chambers, may I have a minute</font>
<font color="cyan">with my client?</font>

310
00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:46,289
<font color="yellow">As I see it, a solicitor is here</font>

311
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:50,209
<font color="yellow">to advise and facilitate</font>
<font color="yellow">my legal rights. Am I correct?</font>

312
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:54,650
<font color="yellow">Huh? Then your advice should've been</font>
<font color="yellow">to tell the detectives everything.</font>

313
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,890
<font color="cyan">There's still a process, Mr Nilsen.</font>

314
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:03,529
<font color="yellow">Mr Moss, I won't be needing you</font>
<font color="yellow">any longer. </font><font color="#008000">I don't advise this.</font>

315
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:05,450
<font color="yellow">No, it's my final decision.</font>
<font color="yellow">It's the only way</font>

316
00:21:05,489 --> 00:21:08,610
<font color="yellow">we're gonna get to the bottom</font>
<font color="yellow">of this mess, once and for all.</font>

317
00:21:10,209 --> 00:21:11,450
<font color="yellow">If you could.</font>

318
00:21:13,249 --> 00:21:14,809
<font color="yellow">Please?</font>

319
00:21:15,969 --> 00:21:17,769
<font color="cyan">Mr Chambers.</font>

320
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,489
<font color="#008000">Ronnie.</font>

321
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:28,610
<font color="yellow">Shall we carry on?</font>

322
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:35,729
<font color="yellow">I was at McDonald's on the way</font>
<font color="yellow">to Oxford Street station.</font>

323
00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:37,209
<font color="yellow">He said he hadn't eaten all day.</font>

324
00:21:37,249 --> 00:21:39,049
<font color="yellow">I mean, what was I meant to say</font>
<font color="yellow">to that?</font>

325
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,249
<font color="yellow">Erm, he had blond hair...</font>

326
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:46,610
<font color="yellow">Well... so did some of the others.</font>

327
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:49,009
<font color="yellow">Stephen, blond hair, Scottish...</font>

328
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,690
<font color="yellow">I can't remember his second name.</font>

329
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,850
<font color="#008000">Just take your time.</font>

330
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,009
<font color="#008000">Take us through it again.</font>

331
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:02,809
<font color="#008000">You went home. What happened then?</font>

332
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,969
<font color="yellow">We drank, we laughed.</font>

333
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:07,729
<font color="yellow">I poured two large glasses</font>
<font color="yellow">of rum and coke.</font>

334
00:22:07,769 --> 00:22:09,330
<font color="yellow">He said he didn't like rum.</font>

335
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,330
<font color="yellow">I said, "Well, you didn't</font>
<font color="yellow">bloody well pay for it, did you?"</font>

336
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,130
<font color="yellow">Yeah. He had a nice laugh.</font>

337
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:18,009
<font color="yellow">I mentioned Tommy,</font>
<font color="yellow">you know the album, Tommy?</font>

338
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:20,569
<font color="yellow">He said he'd never heard it.</font>
<font color="yellow">So I put it on...</font>

339
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,969
<font color="yellow">..and watched as he closed his eyes</font>
<font color="yellow">and listened to it.</font>

340
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:26,850
<font color="yellow">I thought to myself,</font>
<font color="yellow">you lucky bugger,</font>

341
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,529
<font color="yellow">experiencing that</font>
<font color="yellow">for the first time.</font>

342
00:22:29,569 --> 00:22:30,569
<font color="yellow">Yeah...</font>

343
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:36,489
<font color="yellow">I entertained no thoughts of...</font>
<font color="yellow">harming him.</font>

344
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:39,610
<font color="yellow">You know, I had nothing but concern</font>
<font color="yellow">and affection</font>

345
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,890
<font color="yellow">for his future and the...</font>
<font color="yellow">the pain of his life.</font>

346
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,090
But you did strangle him.

347
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:50,809
<font color="yellow">Afterwards, I noticed that</font>
<font color="yellow">his jeans were soaked with urine.</font>

348
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:55,690
<font color="yellow">So, I wanted to wash him clean,</font>
<font color="yellow">so I took his clothes off.</font>

349
00:22:55,729 --> 00:22:57,529
<font color="yellow">And, er...</font>

350
00:22:57,569 --> 00:23:00,969
<font color="yellow">I remember I had difficulty</font>
<font color="yellow">with his tight, wet jeans,</font>

351
00:23:01,009 --> 00:23:04,529
<font color="yellow">but soon as he was sat there naked</font>
<font color="yellow">in my armchair.</font>

352
00:23:04,569 --> 00:23:07,009
<font color="yellow">And he'd only urinated.</font>

353
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:09,690
<font color="yellow">He obviously hadn't had</font>
<font color="yellow">a square meal in a few days.</font>

354
00:23:10,729 --> 00:23:15,209
<font color="yellow">He had deep cuts on both his wrists.</font>
<font color="yellow">They were still open.</font>

355
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:19,690
<font color="yellow">So he must have recently</font>
<font color="yellow">tried to commit suicide.</font>

356
00:23:19,729 --> 00:23:25,249
<font color="yellow">And I very gently carried him</font>
<font color="yellow">through to the bathroom,</font>

357
00:23:25,289 --> 00:23:27,489
<font color="yellow">and put talc on him</font>
<font color="yellow">to make him look cleaner.</font>

358
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,090
<font color="yellow">And he did, he looked magnificent.</font>

359
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,690
<font color="yellow">He was like one of those</font>
<font color="yellow">Michelangelo sculptures.</font>

360
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,650
We need names.

361
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:40,729
<font color="yellow">Mm. I know you do, and I'm trying.</font>
<font color="yellow">But some were a long time ago.</font>

362
00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:43,450
<font color="#008000">Then, stay with the last one.</font>

363
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:45,769
<font color="yellow">I said Stephen.</font>
It's not enough, you know that.

364
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:48,170
I mean,
you remember so many details,

365
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:50,370
there must have been a time
in the evening

366
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,690
he told you his full name.

367
00:23:54,249 --> 00:23:55,809
Look.

368
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:59,090
All we want to do
is corroborate your claims.

369
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:04,729
<font color="yellow">It was definitely a Scottish name,</font>
<font color="yellow">we joked about that. It was...</font>

370
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,249
<font color="yellow">..like Fraser, or...</font>

371
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,209
<font color="yellow">Stephen... Sinclair, it was.</font>

372
00:24:14,249 --> 00:24:16,090
<font color="yellow">Sinclair.</font>

373
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,930
You're sure?

374
00:24:19,969 --> 00:24:22,090
<font color="yellow">Aye. Stephen Sinclair.</font>

375
00:24:23,489 --> 00:24:25,769
JAY: If this Stephen Sinclair
was a drug addict,

376
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:27,529
chances are he has a record.

377
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:29,489
Record will have a photo
and fingerprints -

378
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:31,690
we can match those to what we found
at the flat.

379
00:24:31,729 --> 00:24:35,330
<font color="yellow">He has given us the name, not to</font>
<font color="yellow">mention the torso in his flat.</font>

380
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,249
<font color="yellow">Can't we just charge him, guv?</font>
What if he's got it wrong?

381
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:40,049
Or he's playing with us?

382
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,410
Sinclair walks into our courtroom,
alive and well,

383
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,009
and there goes the credibility.
You know that.

384
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:47,370
No mistakes, no shortcuts.

385
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,289
We need to be good police.

386
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:52,330
<font color="cyan">Peter, it doesn't feel right giving</font>
<font color="cyan">him the blue ribbon treatment here.</font>

387
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:56,729
Whilst he's talking,
we carry on treating him well.

388
00:24:56,769 --> 00:24:57,930
Understood?

389

<font color="#008000">I'll ask.</font>

405
00:25:54,005 --> 00:25:57,804
Sinclair was young.
<font color="cyan">Aye, he'd just turned 20.</font>

408
00:26:04,804 --> 00:26:07,525
He really didn't stand a chance,
did he?

412
00:26:20,124 --> 00:26:24,124
<font color="#008000">It was actually quite simple to</font>

413
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:27,525
<font color="#008000">Er, these are from the last victim.</font>

414
00:26:29,725 --> 00:26:33,245
<font color="#008000">But his head has been boiled</font>
<font color="#008000">beyond all recognition.</font>

415
00:26:37,884 --> 00:26:40,005
Can we fingerprint him?

416
00:26:40,044 --> 00:26:42,005
<font color="#008000">This last one, absolutely.</font>

<font color="#008000">the cause of death?</font>

420
00:26:48,205 --> 00:26:49,405
Strangulation.

421
00:26:49,445 --> 00:26:52,804
<font color="#008000">Well, he was strangled, that's true.</font>

422
00:26:53,925 --> 00:26:58,165
<font color="#008000">But in the autopsy, we discovered</font>
<font color="#008000">his lungs were filled with water,</font>

423
00:26:58,205 --> 00:27:00,925
<font color="#008000">so death was due to drowning.</font>

424
00:27:00,965 --> 00:27:02,765
<font color="cyan">Why did he leave that out?</font>

425
00:27:02,804 --> 00:27:05,925
<font color="#008000">Er, there's something else.</font>

426
00:27:05,965 --> 00:27:09,044
<font color="#008000">Tests show he had Hepatitis B.</font>

427
00:27:09,084 --> 00:27:11,925
<font color="#008000">Quite a common disease</font>
<font color="#008000">with needle-using heroin addicts,</font>

428
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:16,765

<font color="#008000">has been in its vicinity,</font>

00:34:01,725 --> 00:34:04,804
A man has been charged
in connection with his murder.

515
00:34:07,604 --> 00:34:09,364
<font color="yellow">His murder?</font>

516
00:34:09,405 --> 00:34:12,804
I'm sorry to say, we can't give you
much information at present,

517
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:14,564
but we will as soon as we can.

518
00:34:14,604 --> 00:34:17,724
In the meantime,
if there's anything that you need...

519
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,285
<font color="#008000">Can I see him?</font>

520
00:34:21,204 --> 00:34:23,764
<font color="cyan">I'm afraid that's not possible,</font>
<font color="cyan">Mrs Sinclair.</font>

521
00:34:23,805 --> 00:34:26,525
<font color="#008000">But surely we need to identify him.</font>

522
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:29,204
<font color="cyan">He's already been identified.</font>

523
00:34:29,244 --> 00:34:31,005
<font color="#008000">But how?</font>

524
00:34:31,044 --> 00:34:33,164
<font color="#008000">Has somebody come in to see him?</font>

525
00:34:34,845 --> 00:34:36,525
<font color="#008000">I want to see him.</font>

526
00:34:37,684 --> 00:34:41,445
<font color="#008000">Maybe somebody's made a mistake.</font>
Mrs Sinclair, it's Stephen.

527
00:34:44,525 --> 00:34:47,365
I can't tell you how sorry I am
to be sure of that.

528
00:34:49,445 --> 00:34:51,365
But you don't want to see him.

529
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:54,724
Not like this.

530
00:34:57,244 --> 00:35:00,084
<font color="yellow">I told him something like this</font>
<font color="yellow">would happen.</font>

531
00:35:00,124 --> 00:35:05,044
<font color="yellow">But that drug, it changed him</font>
<font color="yellow">and there was nothing we could do.</font>

532
00:35:05,084 --> 00:35:07,244
<font color="yellow">Was there, love?</font>
<font color="#008000">No.</font>

533
00:35:09,684 --> 00:35:13,204
<font color="yellow">He wouldn't listen to us,</font>
<font color="yellow">no matter how hard we tried.</font>

534
00:35:15,124 --> 00:35:19,164
<font color="yellow">He just thought of us as a hotel,</font>
<font color="yellow">or a bank...</font>

535
00:35:19,204 --> 00:35:22,525
<font color="yellow">or a prison.</font>
<font color="#008000">Not now, Neil.</font>

536
00:35:27,244 --> 00:35:28,965
SHE SNIFFS

537
00:35:29,005 --> 00:35:30,845
SHE SOBS

538
00:35:30,885 --> 00:35:32,805
I'm sorry.

539
00:35:44,169 --> 00:35:47,169
FOOTSTEPS COMING DOWN STAIRS

540
00:35:47,209 --> 00:35:49,169
<font color="cyan">Brian?</font>

541
00:35:49,209 --> 00:35:50,810
Yeah.

542
00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:56,689
Oh, thank you.

543
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,089
<font color="cyan">Anything good?</font>
Oh, no, not really.

544
00:36:00,129 --> 00:36:02,289
It's just all so salacious.

545
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,089
<font color="cyan">He just looks so ordinary.</font>

546
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:08,330
<font color="cyan">Like someone you'd walk past</font>
<font color="cyan">in the street, or meet in a bank.</font>

547
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:11,050
You see, that's what makes
the whole thing so intriguing.

548
00:36:11,089 --> 00:36:14,050
This dichotomy
between this seemingly normal,

549
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:18,530
unobtrusive civil servant
and the nature of his crimes.

550
00:36:18,569 --> 00:36:20,689
It just seems so hard to fathom.

551
00:36:20,729 --> 00:36:22,530
<font color="cyan">What's there to fathom?</font>

552
00:36:22,569 --> 00:36:25,370
Well, what makes most of us
go one way with our lives,

553
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:29,609
and others, like Nilsen, go so far
in the opposite direction?

554
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:32,010
<font color="cyan">Probably because he's evil.</font>

555
00:36:33,769 --> 00:36:35,649
<font color="cyan">I'm going to be late.</font>

556
00:36:35,689 --> 00:36:37,370
<font color="cyan">See you tonight.</font>
Mm-hm.

557
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:43,490
REPORTER: <font color="yellow">The man currently</font>
<font color="yellow">being questioned by police</font>

558
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,769
<font color="yellow">is a 37-year-old civil servant,</font>

559
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:50,010
<font color="yellow">Andrew Nilsen, known to</font>
<font color="yellow">his colleagues at work as "Des".</font>

560
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:52,209
<font color="yellow">For the past six months,</font>
<font color="yellow">he's been working here</font>

561
00:36:52,249 --> 00:36:55,769
<font color="yellow">at the Manpower Services Commission</font>
<font color="yellow">in London's Kentish Town.</font>

562
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:58,769
<font color="yellow">I understand that</font>
<font color="yellow">he is also a former policeman,</font>

563
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:02,089
<font color="yellow">having been in the force</font>
<font color="yellow">for about a year in the early '70s.</font>

564
00:37:03,169 --> 00:37:05,850
INDISTINCT CHATTER

565
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,089
<font color="cyan">Probably robbed it.</font>

566
00:37:07,129 --> 00:37:09,569
If I find out
any of you tipped them off

567
00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:11,089
about him being ex-police,

568
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:14,330
I'll personally drag you
to the fucking committee myself!

569
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,530
Do you hear me?

570
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:18,209
We are in blackout,

571
00:37:18,249 --> 00:37:21,410
that means you don't mention
his name outside this station.

572
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:24,649
Not to your wives, your mistresses,
your friends down the pub.

573
00:37:24,689 --> 00:37:25,810
You understand?

574
00:37:27,689 --> 00:37:31,330
This man killed on our patch
for four years.

575
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:34,050
We find every name,

576
00:37:34,089 --> 00:37:38,289
and we charge and convict him
with every single fucking one.

577
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:40,970
He gets away with nothing.

578
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:50,370
Get rid.

579
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,490
KNOCKING ON DOOR
Come in.

580
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,649
<font color="#008000">This gentleman's here about Nilsen.</font>

581
00:38:08,689 --> 00:38:10,330
<font color="#008000">He wants to talk to you, Guv.</font>

582
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:13,530
What can I do for you?

583
00:38:14,649 --> 00:38:17,410
<font color="cyan">Dennis Nilsen tried to kill me.</font>

584
00:38:19,129 --> 00:38:20,649
Where did you meet him?

585
00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:23,289
<font color="cyan">A pub. The Golden Lion.</font>

586
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:25,450
<font color="cyan">Dean Street, Soho.</font>

587
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,289
<font color="cyan">But I'm... I'm not gay.</font>

588
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,689
No, of course.

589
00:38:29,729 --> 00:38:34,569
<font color="cyan">He was with a group of people,</font>
<font color="cyan">who I assume were his friends.</font>

590
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:40,010
<font color="cyan">After last orders, he said we should</font>
<font color="cyan">go back to his for a drink.</font>

591
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,209
<font color="cyan">I thought he meant all of us.</font>

592
00:38:42,249 --> 00:38:45,609
<font color="cyan">But it was only the two of us</font>
<font color="cyan">that went.</font>

593
00:38:45,649 --> 00:38:50,530
<font color="cyan">I must have passed out,</font>
<font color="cyan">because when I came to,</font>

594
00:38:50,569 --> 00:38:54,289
<font color="cyan">he'd tied my ankles together</font>
<font color="cyan">with his tie</font>

595
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:58,769
<font color="cyan">and he was strangling me with mine.</font>

596
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:05,530
<font color="cyan">I managed to fight him off</font>
<font color="cyan">and get him to the ground.</font>

597
00:39:05,569 --> 00:39:11,129
<font color="cyan">He then started screaming,</font>
<font color="cyan">"Take my money! Take my money!"</font>

598
00:39:11,169 --> 00:39:13,410
<font color="cyan">Like I was the one attacking him.</font>

599
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:16,450
Sorry, er, when was this?

600
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,689
<font color="cyan">Three years ago.</font>

601
00:39:19,729 --> 00:39:21,970
<font color="cyan">I'd put it to the back of my mind.</font>

602
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:26,649
<font color="cyan">Moved on. Then when I saw his face</font>
<font color="cyan">in the newspaper, it all came back.</font>

603
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:30,129
Why didn't you go to the police
at the time?

604
00:39:30,169 --> 00:39:33,050
<font color="cyan">I did. Straight away.</font>

605
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:38,930
<font color="cyan">They took me back there.</font>
<font color="cyan">They were there for five minutes.</font>

606
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,450
<font color="cyan">They spoke to Nilsen</font>

607
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:44,010
<font color="cyan">and bought his story</font>
<font color="cyan">that it was a lovers' tiff.</font>

608
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:46,209
<font color="cyan">It wasn't something</font>
<font color="cyan">they wanted to be around.</font>

609
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,769
<font color="cyan">They even apologised to him</font>
<font color="cyan">for wasting his time</font>

610
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:50,930
<font color="cyan">and sent me on my way.</font>

611
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:56,850
OK, erm...

612
00:39:58,609 --> 00:40:00,850
You're just gonna
have to go from the beginning.

613
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:03,890
Leave nothing out.

614
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:26,410
<font color="yellow">So, how many of these</font>
<font color="yellow">has he written to you?</font>

615
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:28,769
Well, the fourth came today.

616
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:31,649
And... and there's a poem
in the last one.

617
00:40:35,569 --> 00:40:39,330
<font color="yellow">"Lives of sorrow, bones of the dead,</font>

618
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:42,289
<font color="yellow">"given by the sea to fitful head."</font>

619
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:44,330
<font color="yellow">It's so... sensitive.</font>

620
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:45,450
Well, quite.

621
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:48,569
You wouldn't think by reading that,
that this man strangled young men

622
00:40:48,609 --> 00:40:50,769
and disposed of them
down the lavatory, would you?

623
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:53,050
<font color="yellow">How is the prison</font>
<font color="yellow">allowing you to meet him?</font>

624
00:40:53,089 --> 00:40:55,050
He said he'd put me
on the visitors' list.

625
00:40:55,089 --> 00:40:58,609
Although they're probably not aware
that I'm a writer.

626
00:40:58,649 --> 00:41:01,769
<font color="yellow">Well, aren't you frightened?</font>
No, no. He's, erm...

627
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:04,769
he's hardly going to jump over
the desk and strangle me, is he?

628
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:08,249
<font color="yellow">No, but still...</font>
<font color="yellow">Do you think you'll shake his hand?</font>

629
00:41:08,289 --> 00:41:10,209
No. No, I shouldn't think so.

630
00:41:14,609 --> 00:41:18,089
<font color="#008000">Name?</font>
Brian Masters to see Dennis Nilsen.

631
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,850
<font color="yellow">You find us OK?</font>

632
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:49,169
<font color="yellow">Do you smoke, Brian?</font>

633
00:41:49,209 --> 00:41:50,450
Yes, I do.

634
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:53,410
Er...

635
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:57,689
<font color="yellow">You can smoke as many real fags</font>
<font color="yellow">in this room as you like.</font>

636
00:41:57,729 --> 00:41:59,569
<font color="yellow">Out there,</font>
<font color="yellow">you're only allowed tobacco.</font>

637
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:04,850
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

638
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,970
<font color="yellow">They say capital punishment's dead,</font>

639
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:12,410
<font color="yellow">but Her Majesty manages</font>
<font color="yellow">to find her little ways, you know?</font>

640
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:15,649
HE CHUCKLES
Yes.

641
00:42:15,689 --> 00:42:18,249
<font color="yellow">I read your book, Brian.</font>

642
00:42:18,289 --> 00:42:25,050
<font color="yellow">The Dukes: Our Origin, Ennoblement</font>
<font color="yellow">And The History Of 26 Families.</font>

643
00:42:25,089 --> 00:42:29,410
<font color="yellow">Are you from aristocracy?</font>
No. No, I'm not.

644
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:31,609
<font color="yellow">You're from that kind of world,</font>
<font color="yellow">though, eh?</font>

645
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:33,609
<font color="yellow">I bet you're a bloody Tory.</font>

646
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:37,089
I'm not sure
that's entirely relevant.

647
00:42:37,129 --> 00:42:41,330
<font color="yellow">I'm just... I'm not entirely sure</font>
<font color="yellow">of your intentions as of yet.</font>

648
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:43,169
<font color="yellow">Yeah. Your letters sounded genuine,</font>

649
00:42:43,209 --> 00:42:46,410
<font color="yellow">but now we're sat</font>
<font color="yellow">opposite each other, I worry.</font>

650
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:50,729
<font color="yellow">I have judged myself more harshly</font>
<font color="yellow">than any casual observer</font>

651
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:52,890
<font color="yellow">or any court ever could.</font>

652
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:55,890
Aren't you the one judging me,
Mr Nilsen?

653
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:59,010
<font color="yellow">How's that?</font>
Oh, you...

654
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:02,569
you hear my accent and you assume
that you know everything about me.

655
00:43:02,609 --> 00:43:05,330
<font color="yellow">I'm simply stating it's obvious</font>
<font color="yellow">where you came from.</font>

656
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:07,490
<font color="yellow">I'm not... It's not a bad thing.</font>

657
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:10,689
<font color="yellow">I just like to know where I stand</font>
<font color="yellow">with the person I'm talking to.</font>

658
00:43:10,729 --> 00:43:14,370
Well, I was... I was brought up on
the Old Kent Road.

659
00:43:16,169 --> 00:43:18,729
<font color="yellow">You don't sound like you were</font>
<font color="yellow">brought up on the Old Kent Road.</font>

660
00:43:18,769 --> 00:43:20,930
Well, I was lucky,
I got an education.

661
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:23,129
<font color="yellow">Ah. Is that where the accent</font>
<font color="yellow">comes from, then?</font>

662
00:43:23,169 --> 00:43:24,769
<font color="yellow">It's your education, is it?</font>

663
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,089
I was under the impression

664
00:43:27,129 --> 00:43:32,330
that I was here to discuss
writing a book about you.

665
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:35,850
Erm...
I'm really not that interesting.

666
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:39,569
<font color="yellow">Why would you want to write</font>
<font color="yellow">about a monster like me?</font>

667
00:43:39,609 --> 00:43:41,330
Do you consider yourself
to be a monster?

668
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:43,530
<font color="yellow">Have you read the paper?</font>
Hmm. Of course.

669
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:49,729
<font color="yellow">It truly amazes me,</font>
<font color="yellow">people's attraction to the macabre.</font>

670
00:43:49,769 --> 00:43:52,010
<font color="yellow">Cos all of us have skeletons</font>

671
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:53,810
<font color="yellow">rattling around in our cupboards,</font>
<font color="yellow">y'know?</font>

672
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:57,890
<font color="yellow">Secrets they would never dare</font>
<font color="yellow">to tell to anyone.</font>

673
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:01,370
<font color="yellow">So, what comes is this flood</font>

674
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:04,810
<font color="yellow">of self-righteous</font>
<font color="yellow">public condemnation,</font>

675
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,890
<font color="yellow">whilst simultaneously,</font>
<font color="yellow">everybody's talking about it over,</font>

676
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:09,689
<font color="yellow">and over and over.</font>
<font color="yellow">They're consuming it</font>

677
00:44:09,729 --> 00:44:11,729
<font color="yellow">and indulging in it,</font>
<font color="yellow">but at arms-length...</font>

678
00:44:11,769 --> 00:44:15,450
I'm not here to do that.
<font color="yellow">Meanwhile, I'm left here to rot,</font>

679
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:18,970
<font color="yellow">whilst others make profits</font>
<font color="yellow">at my expense.</font>

680
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:20,769
Listen,
if you want some money from this,

681
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:22,689
I'm sure that we can come
to some arrangement.

682
00:44:22,729 --> 00:44:24,890
<font color="yellow">I don't want... I don't want a penny</font>
<font color="yellow">from any of this.</font>

683
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:27,649
<font color="yellow">I just don't want those poor men</font>
<font color="yellow">exploited.</font>

684
00:44:28,729 --> 00:44:33,609
Well, I'm not here to exploit you
or those 17 young men that you...

685
00:44:33,649 --> 00:44:35,890
<font color="yellow">15! It was 15.</font>

686
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:39,010
<font color="yellow">It wasn't 17, it was 15.</font>

687
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:41,209
<font color="yellow">See, now,</font>
<font color="yellow">if you're gonna get your information</font>

688
00:44:41,249 --> 00:44:44,850
<font color="yellow">from those red-top fuckers,</font>
<font color="yellow">telling lies about me every day,</font>

689
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,289
<font color="yellow">we might as well say goodbye now,</font>
<font color="yellow">Brian.</font>

690
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:53,289
<font color="yellow">I have a responsibility for my story</font>
<font color="yellow">and theirs to be told correctly.</font>

691
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:55,970
I also have that responsibility.

692
00:44:57,129 --> 00:45:01,689
I... I have no want
to write some two-bit horror novel

693
00:45:01,729 --> 00:45:03,169
with ghoulish adjectives.

694
00:45:03,209 --> 00:45:08,089
I'm not here to elaborate,
or expose or excuse.

695
00:45:08,129 --> 00:45:12,410
I'm here to comprehend,
because the law cannot comprehend

696
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:14,970
beyond the question
of guilty or innocent.

697
00:45:16,169 --> 00:45:18,649
<font color="yellow">And how do you propose to do that?</font>

698
00:45:18,689 --> 00:45:21,010
By listening.

699
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:25,569
I want to know about your
upbringing, your teenage years,

700
00:45:25,609 --> 00:45:27,729
your time in the army.

701
00:45:27,769 --> 00:45:29,530
All of it.

702
00:45:29,569 --> 00:45:33,010
Because only by doing that...

703
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:37,930
do we get the whole picture...
Mr Nilsen.

704
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,850
<font color="yellow">I must warn you, Brian,</font>

705
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:47,850
<font color="yellow">you will find a full inquiry</font>
<font color="yellow">into my life and deeds...</font>

706
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:51,169
<font color="yellow">..distressing.</font>

707
00:45:51,209 --> 00:45:53,169
I'm aware of that.

708
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:54,490
<font color="yellow">Well, then.</font>

709
00:45:54,530 --> 00:46:00,410
<font color="yellow">I pass the burden of my past</font>
<font color="yellow">and deeds onto your shoulders.</font>

710
00:46:04,729 --> 00:46:07,410
<font color="yellow">Make sure you bring</font>
<font color="yellow">an extra pack of fags next time, eh?</font>

711
00:46:10,209 --> 00:46:11,609
<font color="yellow">Oh...</font>

712
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:15,050
<font color="yellow">..please, call me Des.</font>

712
00:46:16,305 --> 00:47:16,266

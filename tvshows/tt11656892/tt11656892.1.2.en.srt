00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,460
 Mr Nilsen has confessed
to killing 15 men,

3
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,780
mostly homeless and vulnerable,
over a period of five years.

4
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,780
We're now in the process
of confirming that number.

5
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,780
We're also aware that there are
up to seven attempted murders.

6
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,780
So we ask anybody
who may have visited

7
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:11,780
195 Melrose Avenue
from December 1978 to 1981

8
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,380
or 23 Cranley Gardens
from 1981 to February this year

9
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,500
to please call
Hornsey Police Station

10
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,120
on the number behind me.

11
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,780
If you know of anybody
that's gone missing...

12
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,680
..sons, brothers, fathers...

13
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,780
..uncles, nephews, cousins,
friends... please contact us.

14
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,620
Because we need your help.
OK, questions, please. Yes, Tim.

15
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,820
How many of the victims
have you identified so far?

16
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,500
Other than Stephen Sinclair,

17
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,260
we won't be naming
any more of the victims

18
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,780
until official charges
have been brought against Mr Nilsen.

19
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,540
Charlotte.
How likely is it

20
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,780
that you'll identify
all 15 of his victims?

21
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,220
Well, we're still in the process
of assessing and analysing

22
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,780
the evidence from Melrose Avenue...

23
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,380
PHONE RINGS

24
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,480
Yes, yes, I understand.

25
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,460
We're absolutely certain,
he killed only male.

26
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,780
His father recognised the knives
on the television.

27
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,780
Gave them to him as a gift
for starting chef's school.

28
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,240
But according to him,

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,200
his son never turned up
on the first day of class

30
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,680
and he hasn't seen him
since May, 1980,

31
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,620
which would match Nilsen's dates
for his third victim.

32
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,080
Next step?

33
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,780
Well, Nilsen's requested a visit,

34
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,980
so I'll take the photo with me
and get him to confirm.

35
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,600
Requested a visit?
Yeah.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,780
I'm hoping he's remembered
some more names.

37
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,820
How are you coping?
Oh, good.

38
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,980
We're trying to get through
the 8,000 missing persons reports.

39
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,780
No, I'm good, thanks.
We need more manpower,

40
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,780
but you know that.
I'm still trying.

41
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,420
What's going on
with John the guardsman?

42
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,780
Healey's checking
all the guardsmen called John.

43
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,680
He's been on that for a few weeks.
There's 256 of them.

44
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,340
Gonna take some time,
but he'll find him.

45
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:20,820
Speaking of which, erm...
We think we might have another lead.

46
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,580
Lodge found three dental plates
in the dig at Melrose.

47
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,400
One of them is only made in Germany.

48
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,400
So he thinks if he can
go over there... To Germany?

49
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,080
..he can narrow it down and probably
come up with another name.

50
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,780
Guv, look, I know it's a long shot,
but...

51
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,980
..if we get another name,
it's gotta be worth it, right?

52
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,400
There's talk from the Yard.
As far as they're concerned,

53
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,780
they already have him
on three counts of murder.

54
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,540
We told the press last week
we think it's 15.

55
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,580
Why do you think we're still active?
I'm just warning you.

56
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,400
We need to start closing the leads
we already have,

57
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,600
not opening new ones,
especially in different countries.

58
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,640
They're nervous about
how much this is costing already.

59
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,340
Oh, so this is about money?

60
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,280
Everything is always about money,
Peter. We've just gotta be smart.

61
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,300
Thank you.

62
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,780
It's no wonder that half
of Category A's on hunger strike.

63
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,120
I might well join them,
just to break the monotony.

64
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,440
No.
Oh, and let me tell you...

65
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,780
..it's perfectly feasible
to be on normal rations in here

66
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,120
and still effectively
remain on hunger strike.

67
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't even know why I'm Category A
in the first place.

68
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,420
I'm hardly gonna escape,
commit suicide. Des...

69
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,820
Help I'm giving the police
should be rewarded,

70
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,780
not punished.
Let me see what we can do.

71
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,320
You said that before.

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,780
Martyn Duffey. Is he one of them?
Yeah, of course. Martyn.

73
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,380
He was number three.

74
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,440
The one I told you about
that I met at Euston Station.

75
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,560
Have you any more?
Hopefully soon.

76
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,780
You said that you had
some more information for me.

77
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,300
Or was that just so you could talk
about your living situation?

78
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,400
No, I'd never do that.
Any news about Bleep?

79
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,780
Just, I've heard nothing
about her since I got in here.

80
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,780
I'll call the dogs' home.
See what I can find out.

81
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,080
I actually have another name
for you.

82
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,620
Uh... Yeah, one of the young men
at Melrose Avenue.

83
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,780
I just woke up,
his name was just there.

84
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,780
Kenneth Ockenden.

85
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,580
Ockenden?
Hmm.

86
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,780
You're a 100% sure?
Kenneth Ockenden?

87
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,780
Yeah. The Canadian lad, was all over
the news when he went missing.

88
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,780
Did you hold his name back from us?
No, why would you say that?

89
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,360
I want these people identified
and laid to rest

90
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,820
just as much as you do, Mr Jay.
I'm simply trying to tell the truth.

91
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,800
But he can't have.
Why not?

92
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,780
Because Ockenden was investigated
for three years.

93
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,140
Right, they found nothing.
What are you thinking?

94
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,980
Well, we're gonna request the files

95
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,780
and treat it
as a murder investigation.

96
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,080
What's the problem?
I know some of the guys, Peter.

97
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,460
Ockenden was a difficult case
for them.

98
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,520
And the press weren't exactly kind
when they couldn't find him.

99
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,240
All right, Steve, request the files.

100
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,780
Can I tell Martyn Duffey's dad?

101
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,780
I made him certain promises
when he first came forward.

102
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Yeah, course.

103
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,120
Sorry, boss,
you might both want to hear this.

104
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,780
Someone's just called
saying he's Nilsen's biographer.

105
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,640
Eh?
Yeah. He asked if we could tell him

106
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,780
anything about the investigation
or the arrest.

107
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,780
No, look, that's just a rag
trying to get a quote.

108
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,220
If they call back,
tell 'em to piss off. Gladly.

109
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,820
Steve?
Let me know when you get the files.

110
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,780
Kenneth Ockenden. Canadian tourist.

111
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,060
Left his hotel in Kings Cross
December 3rd.

112
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,980
He was meant to meet his uncle
on the 5th

113
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,840
to collect some money
for a plane home for Christmas.

114
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,040
He was never seen again.

115
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,080
What, and Nilsen's
only just remembered this?

116
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,260
Nilsen says he met him
in a West End pub.

117
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,540
They talked about his camera,
they spent the day sightseeing.

118
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,840
That night, he strangled him
with a headphone cord

119
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,480
as Ockenden listened to music
in Melrose Avenue.

120
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,780
He disposed of his body
in the garden, as per,

121
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,820
so we are currently looking
for any signs of him in the dig.

122
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,820
Now, look, we all hope
that we find something at Melrose,

123
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,380
but until we do,
these files are our...

124
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,780
..they're our best shot.

125
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,800
Now, look. I know you all think
you might know about this case

126
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,480
because of the media coverage,
but we can't half-arse this.

127
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,320
Nilsen is in there. Somewhere.

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,160
Have you finished?

129
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,380
I tell you explicitly
not to open any more leads

130
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,040
and you open
Kenneth bloody Ockenden!

131
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,420
Ockenden's mother had links
to the Canadian parliament.

132
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,780
His disappearance became political!

133
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,020
So you can imagine
the Yard's reaction

134
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,320
to you making it a murder enquiry
with a serial killer as a suspect.

135
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,580
Nilsen says he killed him, Guv.
Of course he did!

136
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,520
He'd say anything
to stay in the papers.

137
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,460
Ockenden doesn't fit
the victim profile, Peter.

138
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,780
He wasn't homeless or an addict.
He wasn't even gay.

139
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,780
He had a girlfriend back in Canada.
That doesn't mean anything.

140
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,320
Then why did he go home with him?

141
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,780
What evidence have you found?

142
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,820
You want us to tell his family

143
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,420
that a boy the police couldn't find
for three years

144
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,500
was actually killed
by a former copper,

145
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,600
and you don't have
any physical evidence?!

146
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,440
When's he ever lied to us before?

147
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,320
I've been trying to help you.

148
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,040
Get you the money and support
you need to close this case.

149
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,400
But you went behind my back

150
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,040
and made us look like
a bunch of amateurs!

151
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,520
You better be right about this.

152
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,080
TV REPORTER: 'The gruesome search
continues at 195 Melrose Avenue

153
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,940
'for what police now believe
are dismembered remains

154
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,900
'that have been buried in the garden
for three years or more.

155
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,060
'All day, detectives
and forensic science experts

156
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,440
'have been taking the bones
for examination in a laboratory.

157
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,420
'We found a small piece of the jaw

158
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,480
'and some teeth attached to it,
in the rear garden.

159
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,280
'And this morning, they found a
significant amount of human bones.'

160
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,120
Of what we've brought in,
a big percentage of them

161
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,800
turned out to be animal bones.

162
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,500
But of those
that are definitely human,

163
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:06,280
we estimate we have between
eight and 20 different victims.

164
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,280
Are any of them from Ockenden?

165
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,200
No. But a lot of them we couldn't
analyse due to fire damage.

166
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,280
Did we manage to identify
anyone from them? I'm afraid not.

167
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,280
There must be
some more tests we can do.

168
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,280
Look... I know it's not the news
we hoped for.

169
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,280
But it was always
gonna be a long shot,

170
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,280
considering
the amount of time passed

171
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,920
and the astute method of disposal.

172
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,280
I'd say we were fortunate
to get Martyn Duffey.

173
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,360
But you said
there could be as many as 20?

174
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,280
Well, as I say, it's an estimate,
but it's certainly a possibility.

175
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,960
I'll give you gentlemen a minute.
Thank you.

176
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,960
We need to re-test the headphones
found at Cranley Gardens.

177
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,640
Peter, all Ockenden is doing

178
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,860
is sending us up
a bunch of blind alleys.

179
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,280
We may need to move on from him.
You heard what he said.

180
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,120
Possibly 20 victims.

181
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,560
Which means Nilsen may have been
lying to us from the very start.

182
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,280
I'll call it in.

183
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,880
I made something for you.

184
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,500
It's all jumbled
and in no special order,

185
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,740
but I figured, you're the artist.

186
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,280
Only you know what's important
and how to select it, so...

187
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,320
What made you draw these?
Nostalgia, I suppose.

188
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,280
I thought you told the police that
you didn't remember your victims?

189
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,640
No, their names, no.

190
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,840
But that doesn't mean
I don't remember our time together.

191
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,960
I took him up
on maybe four occasions

192
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,600
in the following two weeks.

193
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,860
What did you do
when you "brought him up"?

194
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,280
Well, his naked body fascinated me.

195
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,280
I'd roll him onto his stomach,
roll him onto his back.

196
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,280
Touching him. Stroking him.

197
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,280
I was thrilled
that I had full control...

198
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,280
ownership
over this beautiful body.

199
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:40,580
So control was the, um...
motivation?

200
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,800
Well, nothing's
ever about one thing, Brian.

201
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,280
Sometimes I'd put them
in the other armchair next to mine

202
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,600
while I'd watch
an evening's television.

203
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,180
I'd look over and imagine
what we'd be talking about,

204
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,280
if he could speak.
Then at other times,

205
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,280
you know, I couldn't
actually believe this was happening,

206
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,640
that this was my life. But, uh...

207
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,280
..death gives no refunds.

208
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,280
We spend so much time
talking about me,

209
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,540
but I feel I hardly know
anything about you.

210
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,760
I don't even know if you're married.

211
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,500
No, no. But I do have
my emotional attachments.

212
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,880
OK. Maybe a more simpler question.

213
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,640
Do you remember when you first
became aware of death?

214
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,480
I grew up in a fishing village,
Brian, so...

215
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,280
Death surrounds you
when the sea's involved.

216
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,980
That and the poverty.

217
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,280
I saw my grandfather's corpse
when I was six year old.

218
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,760
How did he die?
At sea. He was a fisherman.

219
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,280
And they brought his coffin
back to the house,

220
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:53,060
it was normal back then.
And my mother, erm...

221
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,280
..woke me up and said,
"Do you want to see your grandad?"

222
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,780
I went into the living room
and he was there, in a box.

223
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,280
How did they explain that?
Well, they didn't.

224
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,280
You didn't know that he was dead?
No, they just said he was sleeping.

225
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,420
After he left, the mystery of death,
it always fascinated me.

226
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:15,720
Sometimes I'd put talc on my face,
paint my lips blue and poke my eyes

227
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,880
till they were bloodshot
and just look in the mirror.

228
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,280
To make yourself seem dead?
Aye.

229
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,280
And was this by yourself or...

230
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,280
..with somebody else there?

231
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,280
Both.

232
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,280
What would you do then?

233
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,960
I would just sit and stare.

234
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,040
Imagining the abyss
as I touched him.

235
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,740
And myself in my own dead image.
So this is about sex.

236
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,020
No! You keep looking
for these simple answers,

237
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,160
but you debase it
to make it purely about that.

238
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,820
I'm not trying to simplify anything,

239
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,700
but you did have sex
with these young men

240
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,740
after they had died.
No, I did not.

241
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:04,940
Did I enjoy them? Yes.
Did I... gain some satisfaction

242
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,280
from looking at their naked bodies
next to mine in the mirror?

243
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,820
But I didn't penetrate them.

244
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,840
Look, look,
the wicked thing that I did

245
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,880
was to squeeze the life
out of a human being.

246
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,220
That was wrong,
that was unforgivable,

247
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,760
I will be
properly punished for it.

248
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,820
But what I did to a corpse
is neither here nor there.

249
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,280
Brian, if you are more disgusted
by what I did to a corpse

250
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,280
than what I did to a living man,

251
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,720
then your moral system
is upside-down

252
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,280
and needs overhauling.

253
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,280
You're right.

254
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,280
I didn't intend to judge you.

255
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,280
Let's go back to your childhood.
Did you have many...

256
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,960
Any friends at school?
I'm glad we're doing this, Brian.

257
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,540
Me too.
It's nice to be listened to.

258
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,140
Makes me feel human again.

259
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,280
All these,
treating me like a criminal.

260
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,560
Do you not consider yourself
to be a criminal?

261
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,660
How I consider myself is obsolete.

262
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,280
I deserve the right to be treated
as innocent until proven guilty.

263
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,840
Not have to wear the clothes
of a convicted felon

264
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,660
whilst I wait for my day in court.

265
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,560
Surely you can see that?

266
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,380
We're sorry
about the result of the dig.

267
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:40,360
We all share your disappointment.
Thank you. It was a blow,

268
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,800
but we have other points of enquiry
we're now investigating.

269
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,980
There's been a development.

270
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,280
Turns out that Nilsen's been getting
regular visits from a biographer.

271
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,120
Apparently his letter
got through the prison censors

272
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,280
and they'd been meeting
for a number of weeks.

273
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,960
Our fear here
is that it's only a matter of time

274
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,720
before the victims' identities,

275
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,940
and especially one
as well known as Ockenden,

276
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,180
become public knowledge.

277
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,020
Therefore, we feel
we need to inform his family.

278
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,960
We're still looking for confirmation
on Ockenden, sir.

279
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,580
The only reason we've been patient
up until now

280
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,560
was the hope that the dig

281
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,280
would give us something
to tie Ockenden to Melrose.

282
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,840
But it's been a month.

283
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,280
I'm aware of that.
But if we had more men

284
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,680
and the word processor
I've requested again and again...

285
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,340
Peter. There is nothing
I would like more

286
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,180
than to find Ken and to bring anyone
who harmed him to justice.

287
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,860
But if we don't have any evidence
by now... We'll find the evidence.

288
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,220
I admire your confidence.

289
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,120
But this investigation
is beginning to harm

290
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,120
the reputation
of the Metropolitan Police.

291
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,140
We've only just repaired the damage
done by the riots.

292
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,620
How are we damaging its reputation?

293
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,240
Because people are starting to ask
why this is all taking so long.

294
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,680
Do you know
how an investigation works? Peter.

295
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,060
Wait for me outside.

296
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,880
What the hell was that?
Top brass care more

297
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,720
about their reputation
than finding these men.

298
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,620
Oh, grow up.

299
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,060
You're not the only one
who cares about this case.

300
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,640
Let me give you some advice, Peter.
Toe the fucking line!

301
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,420
Yeah, that's fine. No, I don't
mind holding while you find out.

302
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,080
What's going on?
Healey thinks he's got John.

303
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,140
Don't bloody jinx it, Steve.

304
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,280
All the guardsmen
were accounted for,

305
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,780
so we were screwed, basically.
Back to square one.

306
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,780
I went to see the West End branch,
asked them if they knew any Johns

307
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,560
from High Wycombe
that frequented Soho.

308
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,640
After giving me a load of grief
about the Ockenden case,

309
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,520
they threw me a name.

310
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,360
John Howlett.

311
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,280
A ne'er-do-well, in and out
of different homes as a kid,

312
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,280
well-known on the streets of Soho.

313
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,640
Sound familiar?
Yeah.

314
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,900
Now we're just checking

315
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,280
the blood type
from the remains in Cranley. OK.

316
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,860
I think we deserve a bit of luck,
don't you?

317
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,700
Yes.

318
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,040
Yep.

319
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,440
OK. Thanks.

320
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,520
We got a match.

321
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,560
Great work, Chris!

322
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,720
Why do you think Nilsen
said he was a guardsman?

323
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,280
I've got no idea.

324
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,280
First round's on me!
You coming?

325
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,280
I'll be there in a bit.

326
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,280
I've just gotta
finish up here first.

327
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,900
Thought you were all down the pub.

328
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,500
You, uh... looking for anything
in particular? Kenneth Ockenden.

329
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,880
Not gonna find him there
in the Cranley Gardens log.

330
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,280
Did we fingerprint the camera?
We did.

331
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,620
What about the books we found?
Yep, all the covers.

332
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,280
But not the pages?

333
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,920
How do you touch pages
and not the covers?

334
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,000
There's just a few books
that might give us something.

335
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,280
The photography book,
the London guide, things like that.

336
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,320
The A to Z.

337
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,880
Guv, is this a good use of time?

338
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,680
I'll see what I can do.

339
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,720
Can he harm us?
I don't see how.

340
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,280
What do you think they talk about?
I don't even wanna know.

341
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,720
Guv. Woman at the front desk,

342
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,000
thinks her ex-partner
might be a possible victim.

343
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,280
Cheers, Chris.

344
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,800
Yeah, he's on his way down. Great.

345
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,080
He went missing about a year ago.

346
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,280
Last time I saw him,
he came round to the house.

347
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,420
We'd been separated a few months,

348
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,320
said he wanted
to spend more time with Shane.

349
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,680
But I knew he was just there
for the money,

350
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,280
so he could go down to Soho
and score.

351
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,040
We had an argument that day
and he left.

352
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,280
And I haven't seen him since.

353
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,120
A week after that, he had a court
date, which he missed.

354
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,760
And he always attended court,
no matter what.

355
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,880
So I went down to the job centre,

356
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,120
they told me
he hadn't signed on.

357
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,280
So then I rang his solicitor,

358
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,280
and they told me to wait a while
and that he'd show up.

359
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,860
But I knew.

360
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,660
And then I saw you on the news,

361
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,540
and even though I know
Graham wasn't bent,

362
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,660
just something
kept turning in my gut.

363
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:21,100
Not all of his victims were gay.
Some just needed a bed or some food.

364
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,800
Do you have a photo?
Yeah.

365
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,280
This.

366
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,120
So, he had a criminal record?

367
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,360
Of course. He almost wore it
as a badge of honour,

368
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,740
you know, him against the system.

369
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,560
I just need to know what happened.

370
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,520
I know he's been
a bit of a shit, but...

371
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,080
he's Shane's dad.

372
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,280
DCI Peter Jay to see Dennis Nilsen.

373
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,280
I need you to identify some photos.
How's Bleep?

374
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,280
Well, you made it pretty busy for me
the last time I was here, Des.

375
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,600
Haven't had a chance
to find out about your dog.

376
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,020
Graham Allen and John Howlett,
AKA John the Guardsman.

377
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,120
Although he wasn't a guardsman,
was he?

378
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,560
He was just another young man,

379
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,280
finding his way
on the streets of Soho.

380
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,280
I am sick of helping people

381
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,720
who take advantage
of my good nature.

382
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,280
I am deserving of some more balance.
What, like with your biographer?

383
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,480
Did you kill these men?

384
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,280
How many people did you kill
in Melrose Avenue?

385
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,800
Did you kill Kenneth Ockenden?

386
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,680
If I hadn't wanted you to,
you wouldn't have found me.

387
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,900
So why would I lie to you now?
Look at the photos.

388
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,600
I've been convicted
of no crimes as of yet,

389
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,220
therefore I am innocent
until proven guilty.

390
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,180
Where is this coming from?

391
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,300
In Category A, like some
kind of dangerous criminal...

392
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,960
Look at the photos and tell me
if you killed these men...

393
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:26,960
What am I gonna do?
Escape? Intimidate a witness?

394
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,320
Des!
I'm your only witness!

395
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,700
This man has a seven-year-old son.

396
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,280
Do the right thing,
and look at the fucking photos.

397
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,280
Did you kill this man?

398
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,980
No comment.

399
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,420
Detective Chief Inspector Peter Jay.
Brian Masters.

400
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,280
Drink?
No, thank you.

401
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,280
You found it all right, then?
Oh, yes, no trouble at all. Good.

402
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,940
So, how long have you been writing?

403
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:56,560
About 15 years. You? I mean,
how long have you been a policeman?

404
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,960
Nearly 23 years.

405
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,280
How many books have you written
about people like Nilsen?

406
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:09,400
Well, this is my first.
Then let me give you some advice.

407
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,480
Walk away.

408
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,760
Well, with all due respect, Mr Jay,
I didn't approach this naively.

409
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,340
Well, why approach it at all?

410
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,480
I mean, you think you can understand
these things he did?

411
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,780
I'm not sure that understanding
is useful here.

412
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,040
The term is emotional
and more often than not,

413
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,960
it leads us to answers

414
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,640
that are indicative
of our own prejudices.

415
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,720
It's not about understanding,
it's about comprehending.

416
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,280
Isn't that the same thing?

417
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,280
Humans kill. It's in our nature.

418
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,640
Out of fits of rage or jealousy,
or self-defence.

419
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:56,280
But to kill so many men
without any real reason...

420
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:02,280
I think it's important that we try
to comprehend why this happened,

421
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,280
and how this person came to pass.

422
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,280
I need you to tell us

423
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,280
everything that Nilsen's told you
about the identities of his victims.

424
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,780
Well, I don't have any more
information than you already have.

425
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,680
Well, you've been talking
for months.

426
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,540
We talk about other things.

427
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,640
Such as?
His childhood. His time in the army.

428
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,960
Was he killing in the army?
No.

429
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:31,600
How often have you been
visiting him? Once or twice a week.

430
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,840
When's the last time you saw him?
Four days ago.

431
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:38,280
And, he wrote to you?
No, I wrote to him.

432
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,280
I'm not really sure why we're here.

433
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,280
Nilsen is no longer helping us
with our investigation.

434
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,800
Since when?
What, he didn't tell you?

435
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,280
Has he even mentioned
Kenneth Ockenden?

436
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,800
Did he kill Kenneth Ockenden?
I didn't say that.

437
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,960
If he mentions any names, you have
a duty to report them to us.

438
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,280
Oh, it's not as simple as that.

439
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,280
Perverting the course of justice
is very simple.

440
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,680
If you are suggesting

441
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,440
that I had anything to do
with his retracting his cooperation,

442
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,120
then you are gravely mistaken,
Mr Jay.

443
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,000
And if you wish to take
this conversation any further,

444
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,100
then maybe
I should telephone my solicitor.

445
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,240
If you wanted
to write a book about Nilsen,

446
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,320
you should have come to us first.
We'd have given you the real story.

447
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:47,280
But you're all so fucking fascinated
by him, aren't you?

448
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,680
Afternoon.
Good afternoon.

449
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,920
Ever since I've come
to this hell on earth,

450
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,460
I have been disrespected,
abused, humiliated.

451
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,960
I have done nothing
but help an investigation,

452
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,280
for which I have not yet
been convicted.

453
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,280
Nobody cares about my years
of public service,

454
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,700
my work with the unions,
that goes unnoticed.

455
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,560
Why didn't you mention
Kenneth Ockenden?

456
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,740
You've spoken to Mr Jay, I see.
Yes. He contacted me.

457
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,840
Yeah.

458
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,280
I didn't mention Ken
cos he's the one I regret.

459
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,940
The day we spent together
was so happy.

460
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,800
The happiest I'd been all year.

461
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:51,400
Unlike the others,
his death was a kind of cruel

462
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,000
and horrid parody
of what could've been.

463
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,700
Well, do you not feel any guilt
or remorse?

464
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,020
Why? They live with me in my cell,
Brian.

465
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,460
All of them.

466
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,720
How can I feel remorse when I have
taken those pains into myself?

467
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,100
That's obscene.

468
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,120
Look, I'd give anything
for any one of them

469
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,280
to walk in here right now
and shoot me dead.

470
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:20,960
But the sad fact is they had to die
to get attention for their plights.

471
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,280
Because the public pious aftercare
comes too late.

472
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,800
And when this is all over,
the Des Nilsens,

473
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,040
and the Stephen Sinclairs
and the Martyn Duffeys of this world

474
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,660
will still stagger along,
unnoticed and alone,

475
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,120
because society is more interested
in death than it is in life.

476
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:43,280
These people that you mention...
they weren't Kenneth Ockenden.

477
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:48,280
You say so yourself. So what was it
that made you kill Kenneth Ockenden?

478
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,280
He was...

479
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,960
They were all my type.

480
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,280
Simple as that?

481
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,400
I once strangled
and drowned a young man.

482
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,640
And then,
when he was lying on the bed,

483
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:08,140
I noticed Bleep licking his face.
He was still alive.

484
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,080
So I resuscitated him.

485
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,380
And he was very confused
when he came to,

486
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,060
he didn't know what had happened.

487
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,680
And he was there for days,
me taking care of him.

488
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,220
And then, when he was well enough
to leave,

489
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:24,180
I took him up to Highgate Station
and we arranged to meet again,

490
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,100
the week after.

491
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,280
Well, the week after came and went,
and he never came back.

492
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,720
Perhaps he should've stayed
in my flat.

493
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,500
The thought of them leaving
triggered the impulse?

494
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,280
Everybody leaves.

495
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,620
Friends, colleagues, boyfriends,
they all disappear eventually.

496
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,380
My grandfather,
my great hero and protector,

497
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,480
was the only person
that I ever loved.

498
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,980
Seeing my grandfather in that box...

499
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,620
..all my troubles started there.

500
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,280
See, it blighted
my personality permanently.

501
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,960
That's why I did all these things.

502
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,280
That and the booze and the music.

503
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:11,340
It whipped me up into
a sort of frenzied fantasy,

504
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,480
that brought the devil
and the darkness.

505
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,280
But without that, I'm harmless.
No, Des, no.

506
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,280
It is not your place

507
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,900
to make objective reasons
why you did these things.

508
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,420
Especially with this spurious logic.

509
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,580
Whose place is it then? Is it yours?

510
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:34,280
No, this book cannot be a subjective
look at your life and your actions.

511
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,280
We both of us,
we must remain objective.

512
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,960
And if there are any lessons
to be learned,

513
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,280
it is up to the reader to decide,
not us.

514
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:47,280
All these ruminations and hypotheses
might be helpful to you,

515
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:51,280
but... it can't be
the end of the road.

516
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,420
That's not what I'm here for.

517
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:01,700
Brian, would you do me a kindness?
I need to find out about my dog.

518
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,640
Could you do that for me?

519
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,280
Yes, I'll see what I can do.

520
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,280
Peter. Gotta come and see this.

521
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,280
Brian?
Guv.

522
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,280
We've got a partial print
off the A-Z which ain't Nilsen's.

523
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,280
Looks like Ockenden's.

524
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,280
You sure?

525
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,280
Hell of a hunch, Guv.

526
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,660
Ah. Thank you.
Peter, this is Commander Lockwood.

527
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,380
You know Russell.
Good to meet you, sir.

528
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,820
Peter, I'd like to congratulate you.

529
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,420
Although we were all understandably
sceptical at first,

530
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,840
Ockenden is a huge weight
off this force.

531
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,980
Thank you, sir.
It wasn't the easiest one for us,

532
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,780
but it shows
we're getting through it.

533
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,280
Well, obviously these things
can't last forever.

534
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,200
And upstairs feel
that confirming Ockenden

535
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,020
is a natural place
to wrap things up.

536
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,120
Therefore, a decision has been made.

537
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,280
We're going to charge him
with six murders

538
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,520
and bring the investigation
to a close.

539
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:13,780
Sir... if I may,
I think this is a mistake.

540
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,280
We have leads which I'm sure
will bring us more names.

541
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,500
A woman called Lesley Mead
has come forward.

542
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,720
We suspect her ex-partner
might be a victim... Detective.

543
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,800
We have spent a fortune
on your team's overtime alone.

544
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,100
Six murders. He never gets out.
Charging him with six is a joke...

545
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,020
Peter.
But Guv...

546
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,280
The decision has been made.
Please, sir, if I may.

547
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,500
There are at least nine families

548
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,280
who will never get closure
if we stop now.

549
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,120
We just need more time and
we'll find all 15, I'm sure of it.

550
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,040
But we're not even sure
he killed 15, are we?

551
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,280
And now that he's stopped talking
to us, perhaps we'll never know.

552
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:53,280
No. It's time for you and your team
to move on, Peter.

553
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,020
I'm sure your families
will be very happy to see you.

554
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,060
Can I, erm...
can I have everybody's attention?

555
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,420
Scotland Yard have just given
the order to shut us down

556
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,060
and to charge him
with the six we've got.

557
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,280
I can't tell you how proud I am
of this team.

558
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,280
And of the work that we've done
together over the past four months.

559
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,500
The six we found...

560
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,960
Well, that's the kind of police work

561
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,820
you can't just do
from behind a desk.

562
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,800
You're a credit to yourselves...
and each other.

563
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,080
Thank you.

564
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,280
Nilsen, a 37-year-old civil servant,

565
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,080
was arrested and charged
after human remains were discovered

566
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,400
at two properties in North London.
He has now been committed to trial

567
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,500
for six charges of murder
and two attempted murders.

568
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,280
The former police officer is due
to appear in court later this week,

569
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,140
where he is expected to plead guilty
on all charges.

572

Can I get you anything?
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

573
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,280
I'll leave you to it.
Thanks, love.

574
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,280
How have you been?
Yeah, not bad.

575
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,280
What have you got?
It's about the Nilsen case.

576
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,480
Of the remains
found in Cranley Gardens,

577
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,000
one of the jaw bones had scars

578
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,380
on both sides of the jaw
due to a fracture.

579
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,280
Take a seat, mate.

580
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,280
Graham Allen had his jaw broke
in a fight. It's in his record.

581
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,520
That doesn't necessarily
mean it's Allen.

582
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,280
So, Bowen goes to Allen's
odontologist.

583
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,840
Finds a denture that he had made,
but never picked up.

584
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,280
It fit the jaw.

585
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,940
Graham Allen is the third victim
of Cranley Gardens.

586
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,280
When he came round
to the house that day...

587
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,940
..the last thing
that I said to him was...

588
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,280
.."I hope that you never come back."

589
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,280
He'd have known
you didn't mean that.

590
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,900
Would he...? Sorry.

SHE SOBS

592
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,600
Would he have... felt any pain?

593
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,280
I don't think so.

594
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,220
OK.

595
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,640
Lesley, erm...

596
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,060
You know
we've already charged Nilsen.

597
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,280
That indictment's already been
written up and processed.

598
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,280
What are you saying?

599
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,280
We can't add Graham's name
to the list of Nilsen's victims.

600
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,160
But you just said
that he killed him. He did.

601
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,380
But the court
has a time limit to add names,

602
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,280
and that passed a few days ago.

I'm afraid not.

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,920
I think he thought
it would make me feel better.

613
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,800
But all it did
was make me more angry.

614
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:04,020
You got, uh, two kids, right? Sorry,
Steve, I mean, I should know that.

615
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:07,280
Four. Two boys, two girls.

616
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,080
Linda wants another.

617
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,940
Well, I mean, our first,
another for me.

618
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,440
You not so much?
Well, I'd like to.

619
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,600
But I've already fucked it up
four times.

620
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,280
This job does that.
How are the boys?

621
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,520
I haven't seen them for a while.

622
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,940
I'm sorry to hear that, Peter.

623
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,280
We should have stopped him, Steve.

624
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,160
We caught him first chance we could.
But we should have known.

625
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,120
Sometimes it's just not possible.

626
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:48,280
I mean, he had a normal life,
a normal job.

627
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,280
You going to the committal hearing?
Yeah. You?

628
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,900
Aye. I can't wait for it
all to be over.

629
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,580
D'you know that he was the one

630
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,500
that wrote the letters
about the blocked drains?

631
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,020
Told his landlord he wouldn't
pay rent until they were cleaned.

632
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,300
I mean, this whole thing,
it's always been to Nilsen's script.

633
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:21,460
Brian?
Hello?

634
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,720
A dogs' home called for you.

635
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,940
They said further to your enquiry,
Nilsen's dog has been put down.

636
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,280
He asked me to find out
about his dog, that's all.

637
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,280
I need to get him to trust me.
Otherwise all this is for nothing.

638
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,800
So, what, now you're doing
errands for him? Oh, come on.

639
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,740
Someone who knows our world,
our community, needs to write this.

640
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,960
Otherwise they'll get it wrong.
I mean, they'll fuck it up.

641
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,440
They already are.
Please... please try and understand.

642
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,280
Just make sure it's not him
who's writing it.

643
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,280
REPORTERS CALL OUT

644
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,400
Inspector! Having spent
so much time with Nilsen,

645
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,280
can you tell us
what is he really like?

646
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,380
Unremarkable.
What makes you say that?

647
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,440
REPORTERS CALL OUT

648
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,000
This is a surprise, Brian.
Hello, there, Des.

649
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,600
How are you doing?
Ah, I can't complain.

650
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,280
If I did, who'd listen?

651
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,180
Des, erm...

652
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:12,000
..Bleep was put down
by the dogs' home.

653
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:17,620
She became ill
not soon after you'd been arrested

654
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:23,280
and they thought
that it would be kinder that way.

655
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:28,040
She forgave me everything
and never let me down.

656
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,720
But in the moment
of her greatest crisis,

657
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,120
I wasnae there for her.

658
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,280
How's the book progressing?

659
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,280
It's coming along very well,
thank you.

660
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,280
I'm currently writing
about your experiences in Aden.

661
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:49,580
Another place the British Army
should have never been.

662
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,280
When they came to get me,
I thought you were my solicitor.

663
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,280
Sorry? Solicitor? I thought you'd
dispensed with your legal aid?

664
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,280
Change is the only constant in life.
Who said that?

665
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,860
Heraclitus.
Yeah.

666
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:08,700
No, well, this solicitor,
this one has a tax-deductible heart,

667
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,000
but needs must, y'know?

668
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,280
Right, well...
I'll see you up there.

669
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,000
I do wanna thank you, Brian.

670
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:24,660
For what?
Your company.

671
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,280
All rise.

672
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:26,280

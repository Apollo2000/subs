TV REPORT: 'Dennis Nilsen
is charged with murdering

2
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,900
'Kenneth Ockenden, Martyn Duffy,
William Sutherland, Malcolm Barlow,

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,520
'John Howlett and Stephen Sinclair.

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,520
'He's also accused of attempting
to murder Douglas Stewart

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,720
'and Paul Knobbs.'

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,620
As each of the
eight charges were read out,

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,520
the defendant was asked,
"How say you, Nilson?

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,520
"Are you guilty or not guilty?"

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,200
'Eight times, in a firm voice,
he replied, "Not guilty." '

10
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,520
'But is Nilson guilty of murder,

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,000
'or is he guilty
only of manslaughter?'

12

13
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,000
I don't understand.

14
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,520
Well, it's quite simple.

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,260
Having spoken to my solicitors,
my barrister, um...

16
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,520
learned people
from the psychology profession,

17
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,520
I'm not sure if I am guilty.

18
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,040
But on-on what grounds?

19
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,800
In all the months
that we've been talking

20
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,200
you've not mentioned
a plea of insanity once.

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,520
Not insanity, no.
Diminished responsibility.

22
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,240
But am I mad? I don't know.

23
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,520
Madness, as Quixote said,
"Madness is seeing life as it is,

24
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,040
"and not as it should be."

25
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,880
You murdered those men, Des.

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,840
And you knew what you were doing.

27
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,560
Did I?
I don't deny taking their lives.

28
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,160
I must wear the label of a killer,
and maybe I should be hanged for it.

29
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,320
But I didn't plan them. Never.

30
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,400
I took them home
with much purer intentions.

31
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,940
Then I'd wake up
and they'd be sat there, dead.

32
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,260
Now, no-one feels the weight
of that more than me.

33
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,060
But the power of responsibility,
at that time, was nil.

34
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,820
I-I look in the mirror,
and I see me, yeah?

35
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:58,520
Just me. It's friendly, helpful,
responsible me. Just that.

36
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,840
If this was true,
then why didn't you go to the police

37
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,160
after the first time it happened?

38
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,520
Don't you think
I contemplated that, Brian? Eh?

39
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,760
Don't you think I wanted
to hand myself in, or end it all?

40
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,740
Y'know? But then...

41
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,520
survival and shame and the future

42
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,200
makes you promise yourself
it'll never happen again...

43
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,100
till it does.

44
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,360
But yeah, I mean...

45
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,860
had it not been for the dog,
I may well have surrendered myself.

46
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,220
All I know is I don't know,

47
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,020
and thus, a jury needs to decide.

48
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,400
The press will be allowed to publish
every word spoken in court.

49
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,520
Every single detail exposed.

50
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,420
Is that not what you're doing?

51
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,280
Well, I'm not exploiting these young
men's tragedies to sell newspapers.

52
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,940
No, you're just exploiting me.

53
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,640
I hope you know me better than that.

54
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,720
I just want to get to the truth.

55
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,520
Don't you?

56
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,040
KNOCK AT DOOR

57
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,520
Peter, you know Mr Green, QC.
Allan, please.

58
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,100
I hear he's got
the Krays' brief?

59
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,080
And Ivan Lawrence as QC.

60
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,520
It's a formidable defence team,
to say the least.

61
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,680
Please, take a seat.

62
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,880
I take it their angle's
diminished responsibility?

63
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,080
Didn't wash with Sutcliffe.
The jury won't buy it.

64
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,720
Sutcliffe didn't watch TV
with the bodies.

65
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,200
Nilsen's not insane.

66
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,720
They don't have to prove that.

67
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,420
All they have to do

68
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,880
is show that he was suffering
some abnormality of mind

69
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,260
and therefore not fully
responsible for what he was doing.

70
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,280
We, on the other hand,
have to prove that these crimes

71
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,620
were carefully planned
and premeditated.

72
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,120
Surely his confessions do that.

73
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,520
I'm afraid the confessions
only take us so far.

74
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,980
What do you mean?

75
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,060
He gave you a lot of answers
which prove what he did,

76
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,700
but not what mind
he was in when he did it.

77
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,660
He gave you exactly
what he wanted to.

78
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,880
You hardly asked him
any probing questions

79
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,200
about what was on his mind.

80
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,940
Hold on. We didn't want him
to suddenly stop talking.

81
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,120
We needed to identify 15 people.

82
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,040
I understand that, but the effect
was he gave you a lot of details

83
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,900
that aren't going
to help us convict him.

84
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,360
I'm sorry,
are you saying he planned this?

85
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,360
We'll never know. But if all
we have are the confessions,

86
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,560
then that's not going to be enough.

87
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,040
We need more. Much more.

88
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,560
We should have pushed for motive.

89
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,100
Don't listen to Green.

90
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,520
Everybody always thinks they're
a better copper than a copper.

91
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,240
If he'd have stopped talking

92
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,420
there's no way we'd have
found the people we did.

93
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,520
Listen, they're just looking
for someone to blame

94
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,180
if this all goes pear-shaped.

95
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,520
But we're gonna make
damned sure that doesn't happen.

96
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,520
Yeah.

97
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,520
See you tomorrow.

98
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,120
Thanks for meeting me.

99
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,240
Please, take a seat.

100
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,720
I almost didn't come.

101
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,860
But you did.

102
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,180
Cos you know this is wrong.

103
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,880
I take it he's written to you over
the past few months? Oh, he has.

104
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,900
How much?

105
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,640
52 exercise books' worth.

106
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,740
We're gonna need
to take a look at them.

107
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,560
That could be useful
to prove premeditation. Mr Jay...

108
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,020
All that matters is that
we find as much evidence as we can

109
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,520
that Nilsen was in his right mind.

110
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,820
What if he's insane?

111
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,520
You think he's insane?

112
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,280
Well, it's not for me to decide.

113
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,520
He's not mad.
He knew what he was doing was wrong.

114
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,420
Well, I don't deny that.

115
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,880
But at the same time,

116
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,600
he was able to take
the head of someone he'd known,

117
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,840
the severed head,
into a cooking pot on the stove,

118
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,000
and let it simmer overnight.

119
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:35,340
And then the next morning he was
able to pour himself a cup of coffee

120
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,940
and butter a slice of toast,
whilst turning up the heat

121
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,520
to make sure that the head
was boiling properly.

122
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,520
Now that is completely mad.

123
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,240
He's really done a number
on you, hasn't he?

124
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,400
You mistake me, Mr Jay.

125
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,520
He's not my friend.
I know who he is.

126
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,360
Do you?

127
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,520
Right, well,
if there's nothing else...

128
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,820
Listen, if he can convince a jury
that he was out of his mind somehow,

129
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,520
then he only gets manslaughter.

130
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,380
He goes to a hospital and then
in 15 years he's deemed cured,

131
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,000
and he's back out on the streets.

132
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,480
Is that justice for the victims
and their families?

133
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,040
If that happens...

134
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,520
..can you live with yourself?

135
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,400
Because I know I can't.

136
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,520
I'll drop the exercise books off
at the station.

137
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,520
'But we have a murder weapon.'

138
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,700
A tie attached to a knotted rope.

139
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,820
Seems pretty pre-emptive to me.

140
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,480
OK, good. What else?

141
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,000
We've got Duffey's knives.

142
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,900
Nilsen let them rust
in his back garden

143
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,520
so they could never
be traced back to Martyn.

144
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,860
That shows knowledge of wrongdoing,
therefore criminally sane.

145
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,160
That's a stretch.

146
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,400
What about these books from Masters?

147
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,720
Surely there's got to be something
in here.

148
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,860
The tragedy of the monochrome man?

149
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,640
I mean,
most of it's rambling nonsense.

150
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,080
They help the defence if anything.

151
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,620
What about Douglas Stewart?

152
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,160
The press'll have a field day
with what happened to Stewart.

153
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,160
Oh! Police embarrassment is hardly
relevant now. We have to use him.

154
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,940
What else?

155
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,560
What about the Soho Project?

156
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,520
What about it?

157
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,880
A woman called.

158
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,760
Thinks someone in her therapy group
could be a possible victim...

159
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,520
but I thought we weren't
looking for them any more.

160
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,540
OK, Steve and I will follow that up.

161
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,740
Is that our lot?

162
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,520
Paul Knobbs,
in his statement, says...

163
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,520
VOICES FADE

164
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,780
Sorry to have called.

165
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,520
It's just he's been having
this recurring dream,

166
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,000
but actually,
I think he's been attacked. OK.

167
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,320
I hope I'm not wasting your time.

168
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,620
Is it all right
if we have a word with him?

169
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,940
Go easy on him, OK?

170
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,520
Of course. What's his name?

171
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,840
Carl.

172
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,520
All right.

173
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,160
'I'm in a dark room.'

174
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,000
I don't know where, and...

175
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,420
there's music but it's calm.

176
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,060
And then... this man appears.

177
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,280
And I can't see his face,

178
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,740
but he's very close to me.

179
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,320
Um... But I'm not afraid,
because... I'm warm.

180
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,040
I'm wrapped up
in some kind of sleeping bag.

181
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,740
And then, all of a sudden,
I feel something around my neck...

182
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,260
um...digging into my throat,
and-and choking me.

183
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,260
And I can hear him saying,
"Just stay still".

184
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,080
And then everything goes dark.

185
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,040
But then, after a while,
I feel... something on my face,

186
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,520
like... sort of like
a dog licking me or something.

187
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,560
Can you remember what breed?

188
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,660
Um... No.

189
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,740
Carl?

190
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,520
Have you seen this man?

191
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,180
Yeah, yeah, on the news.
His name is Dennis Nilsen.

192
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,780
He killed 15 young men
and attempted to kill seven others.

193
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,220
All of these men were strangled.

194
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,960
Mostly with a tie
or a headphone cord.

195
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,520
But one, he tried to kill
with a sleeping bag.

196
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,520
No...

197
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,280
..um... cos the man in my dream
keeps telling me

198
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,680
not to get caught up in the zip.

199
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,620
He also said he
attempted to drown him

200
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,400
before resuscitating him.

201
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,520
I've never told
anyone about the water.

202
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,300
Do you remember the water?

203
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,520
Yeah.

204
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,360
Um...

205
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,520
It was cold water,

206
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,400
and I was being held down.

207
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,520
Where? In a bath or a sink?

208
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,520
I don't understand. Are you...

209
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,780
Are you telling me that
this actually happened? Yes.

210
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,120
I think you're one
of Nilsen's attempted victims.

211
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,340
Because everything
that you are telling us

212
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,140
aligns to what he told us.

213
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,260
Can you remember where you met him
or anything about where he lived?

214
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,520
Well, no... You said he warned you
about the sleeping bag.

215
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,160
What did he say exactly?
I don't know.

216
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,280
When he warned you about the zip,

217
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,400
it shows he was planning it
way before he did it

218
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,380
so I need you to be clear. Come on.

219
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,580
Just try to remember.
I don't wanna do this any more.

220
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,680
Look, you have to.
I know this is tough,

221
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,120
but we need all the details.
Detective.

222
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,620
Just think. Detective,
he's told you he's had enough.

223
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,520
I'm aware of that,
but I'm-I'm just trying... Peter.

224
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,080
'We can't use him.'

225
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,040
He won't survive cross-examination.

226
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,740
You saw him in there.
They'll destroy him.

227
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,040
I'll come back in a couple of days,

228
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,920
see if I can get
a statement from him

229
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,380
and we can read that out in court,

230
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,040
if we need to.

231
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,120
Peter...

232
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,240
we have enough.

233
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,860
He led us to the bodies,
for fuck's sake.

234
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,760
For the first day of this,
the trial of Dennis Nilsen,

235
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,680
the unassuming civil servant
who's charged with crimes

236
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,520
that have shocked
and sickened the nation.

237
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,520
Nilsen is charged with six murders
and two attempted murders.

238
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,080
Details of a recently identified
seventh victim, Graham Allen,

239
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,320
a heroin addict and petty criminal,

240
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,140
will not be featured
on the indictment.

241
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,920
CROWD SHOUTING
Masters!

242
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,720
What's it like being friends
with a serial killer?

243
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,300
What's it like rubbing shoulders
with a murderer, Masters?

244
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,360
SHOUTING OVER EACH OTHER

245
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,040
What's it like being friends
with a serial killer?

246
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,000
Steve.

247
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,940
You all right? Good.

248
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,520
Sleep OK?
No. I never do.

249
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,620
Oh, here he is.
Brian Masters -

250
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,920
biographer to the
murderer of the century.

251
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,520
Did you see the press outside?

252
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,880
Jesus,
they'll have headlines for weeks.

253
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,900
Revelling in the case, like carrion.

254
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,220
One of the papers today
had the headline

255
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,520
"House Of Horrors - The Trial."

256
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,820
The only "house of horrors"
I've ever seen

257
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,520
is Number Ten Downing Street.

258
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,520
They mention you an' all.
Yes, I saw.

259
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,300
Yeah? How do you feel, being talked
about in a national newspaper?

260
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,860
You wanted to see me?

261
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,980
Aye. They've brought me
my suit, but no tie.

262
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,720
I was wondering if I could borrow yours.

263
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,940
Right.

264
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,700
I know it's an ask,
but an open-necked shirt

265
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,420
isn't the kind of impression
I want to give out

266
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,020
on the first day of the trial.

267
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,520
Right. I'll leave it with the guard.

268
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,160
My saviour.

269
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,520
I started out with 15 ties,

270
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,360
but now the police
have them all in evidence.

271
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,020
You, the members of the jury,
will be asked

272
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,660
to ascertain this man's state
of mind at the time of the killings

273
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,860
and to decide, as a result,

274
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:27,300
if he is guilty of the murder
of six innocent young men,

275
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,320
or merely of their manslaughter.

276
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,960
That Mr Nilsen killed these men
is not contested by the defence.

277
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,580
They will argue, however,

278
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,780
that he was out of his mind
when he committed his crimes,

279
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,860
and that he cannot
be held truly accountable.

280
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,160
But I intend to prove that Mr Nilsen
not only knew what he was doing,

281
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,040
but that these crimes were
premeditated and carefully planned.

282
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,520
He lured 15 innocent young men

283
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,720
back to his home,

284
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,860
before cruelly murdering them.

285
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,860
Mr Nilsen is no madman.

286
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,460
He is intelligent and rational,

287
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,520
possessing the skills
to conceal his crimes,

288
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,860
and manipulate those around him.

289
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:19,380
He is, in short, an experienced
and calculating killer.

290
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,960
I have spent a total of 14 hours
with Dennis Nilsen,

291
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,380
on 16 separate occasions
since his arrest.

292
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,400
You are a forensic psychiatrist,
Dr Hardy? Correct.

293
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,120
Could you share with the court
the clinical evaluation

294
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,300
you made of the defendant
during these many meetings?

295
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,060
Did you find, for example,
any evidence of mental abnormality?

296
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,280
Quite the reverse.
I formed the impression very quickly

297
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,740
that he was
a highly intelligent man.

298
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,880
In my view, Nilsen possesses
an extremely rational mind.

299
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,460
He is capable of feeling very deeply

300
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,260
and concealing these feelings
in order to preserve appearances.

301
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,920
Thank you. No further questions,
my Lord.

302
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,540
Dennis Nilsen killed
perhaps 15 young men,

303
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,520
for no apparent reason.

304
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,200
He kept their bodies,
bathed and dressed them,

305
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,260
watched television programmes
with them,

306
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,240
conversed with them
about those programmes.

307
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,160
You say you find no evidence
of mental disturbance.

308
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,520
Of course strangling people
is not normal behaviour.

309
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,760
While Nilsen was on remand,

310
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,260
he made a series of protests
and complaints

311
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,860
about his treatment
in Her Majesty's Prison Herne Hill.

312
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,300
Would you not agree that this shows
markedly paranoid tendencies?

313
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,160
Perhaps. In some cases.

314
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,920
And in this case, in fact,
his behaviour became so extreme,

315
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,500
so erratic, that he was recently
put down as a suicide risk.

316
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,640
Could you tell us, Dr Hardy,

317
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,360
who the psychiatrist was
who recommended this step?

318
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,400
I did.

319
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,520
So, would you not agree

320
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,400
that someone at risk of suicide
is, by definition,

321
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,940
suffering a mental disorder?

322
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,520
I suppose, in strict terms,
that is true.

323
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,160
Thank you.
No further questions, my Lord.

324
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,140
Miss Mead?

325
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,180
They're using
what happened to Graham,

326
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,500
making it all public,

327
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,800
but he doesn't get justice?

328
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,480
I know.

329
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,620
Look, there are certain details
about his case that can...

330
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,920
You didn't give a shit about him

331
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,220
when you thought
he was just a junkie who OD'd

332
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,000
in a squat or a bedsit somewhere.

333
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,140
But now, you're gonna
bring up every little detail.

334
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,520
I'm sorry.

335
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,540
No, you're not.

336
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,520
Do you have any fucking idea
what you've put me through?

337
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,860
And he won't even get justice?

338
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,080
All you lot care about

339
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,160
is you're the people
that caught Dennis Nilsen.

340
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,220
Peter. We're back in.

341
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,780
'So, Mr Stewart,'

342
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,620
after meeting him
in the Golden Lion,

343
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,860
Mr Nilsen suggested that you
both go back to his residence

344
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,020
to continue drinking?
That's right.

345
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,760
195 Melrose Avenue.
I remember it very clearly.

346
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,820
And what happened next?
We had a couple more pints.

347
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,880
He offered me vodka
but I said, "It's not my drink".

348
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,820
Then he asked me
to go to bed with him.

349
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,100
I said that wasn't my thing either.

350
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,380
So I fell asleep on the sofa.

351
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,280
I woke up,
must have been a few hours later,

352
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,200
and my ankles were tied together
with a tie.

353
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,520
Nilsen was kneeling on my chest,
trying to strangle me.

354
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,520
But I fought him off.

355
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,520
I wasn't going down
without a fight.

356
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,440
How did he respond to that?

357
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,820
He started shouting,
"Take my money, take my money!"

358
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,520
Really loud, like.

359
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,440
But you weren't stealing from him?

360
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,680
Seemed like he was trying
to make the neighbours think

361
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,200
he was being attacked himself.

362
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,860
He was trying to create an alibi.

363
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,520
Hardly the act
of a man out of his mind.

364
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,780
Thank you, Mr Stewart.
No further questions, my Lord.

365
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,300
In your police statement,
Mr Stewart,

366
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,260
you said you stayed
for another drink with Nilsen.

367
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,140
Another drink, after he
allegedly tried to kill you?

368
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,520
Well, I thought that was
the best way to calm him down.

369
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,520
I see.

370
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,980
You mentioned earlier

371
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,880
that you remembered seeing
the address as 195 Melrose Avenue.

372
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,060
How did you remember
the address so clearly?

373
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,560
I saw the number on the door.

374
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,200
You also told us that
when you met him in the pub

375
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,240
the defendant introduced himself
to you as Dennis.

376
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,220
Yeah.
And that when you got to his house

377
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,520
to continue your drinking session
together, he offered you vodka.

378
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,040
That's right.

379
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,320
Unfortunately, none of these
things are true, are they?

380
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,860
The defendant's
first name may be Dennis

381
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,520
but he always calls himself Des.

382
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,880
He always drinks rum, not vodka,

383
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,520
and there is no number plate
on the house at Melrose Avenue.

384
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,880
There never has been.

385
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,420
I dunno, I thought there was.

386
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,820
Mm, but you seemed
so sure of the details before.

387
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,160
And why might that be?

388
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:02,520
Why might someone go to the trouble
of furnishing their testimony

389
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,520
with a great deal of specific detail

390
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,340
that seems to be
pulled from thin air?

391
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,520
I put it to you, Mr Stewart,
that your testimony to this court

392
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,520
is nothing more than a pack of lies,

393
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,520
dreamt up to satisfy
a tabloid newspaper.

394
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,580
Well, Mr Stewart?

395
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,640
Have you sold your story?

396
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,520
Er... Y... Yes.

397
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,520
THEY SIGH
No further questions, my Lord.

398
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,520
'How dare he!'

399
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,180
Standing up there in that ridiculous
suit, spouting those lies.

400
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,720
So you're saying that
Douglas Stewart is lying?

401
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,540
That you didn't try and kill him?

402
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,720
Yes, I did.
But not as he described it.

403
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,940
This is about absolute truth, Brian.

404
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,840
It has to be,
otherwise we don't get any answers.

405
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,520
You cannot possibly believe

406
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,040
that what you put him through
out there was justified.

407
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,520
What are you getting
so agitated about?

408
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,280
I'm giving you a wonderful
final act for your book.

409
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,040
Like you said about the book, Brian,

410
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,760
it's not up to us
to make subjective decisions.

411
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,520
We have to remain objective
in all of this.

412
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,040
Thus, it is up to
the jury to decide

413
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,820
whether I'm just bad...

414
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,520
or outrageously bad.

415
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,520
See you back in chambers. Thank you.

416
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,680
Did you know he'd sold
his story to the press?

417
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,560
Course I didn't!

418
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,300
We're lucky the judge didn't strike
his testimony from the record.

419
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,520
It can't have harmed us that much,
right?

420
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,860
Stewart's credibility is gone,
his testimony is now useless.

421
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,780
We're in a lot of trouble.

422
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,080
Surely we still have enough?

423
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,780
I mean, we have the tie with the
knotted rope, and Duffey's knives.

424
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,740
All those show
premeditation to murder.

425
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,260
Peter, physical evidence
is all very good and well,

426
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,680
but it's also circumstantial.

427
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,320
We had an eye witness, a survivor,

428
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,740
and without that,
we're significantly weaker.

429
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,440
Sorry.

430
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,340
Hello, Carl.

431
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,940
Can I come in?

432
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,880
How have you been?

433
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,520
Things keep coming back to me.

434
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,520
What kind of things?

435
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,520
He said he liked my shoes.

436
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,720
Thank you.

437
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,560
The doctor said
it was all nightmares, caused...

438
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,740
I'd had a bit of a hard time
with an ex of mine.

439
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,520
They even put me on tablets
to block everything out.

440
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,540
Listen, Carl, um...

441
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,520
..the trial
isn't going how we'd hoped.

442
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,040
We think your testimony
could be crucial.

443
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,940
But I've already given my statement.

444
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,300
The man said that would be enough.

445
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,520
I know, but we need you
to give it in court.

446
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,520
What, with him there?

447
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,520
You wouldn't have to be close
to him... No, I can't.

448
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,220
Carl...
He killed me, Mr Jay.

449
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,960
And then he...
brought me back to life.

450
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,020
I can't imagine
what you've been through, Carl.

451
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,760
I really can't.

452
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,580
But please believe me,

453
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,520
if he gets a lesser sentence,
you'll find no peace.

454
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,520
I'm sorry. I can't...

455
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:57,320
..be in the same room as him.

456
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,120
I can't go back there.

457
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,520
Then they'll subpoena you anyway.

458
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,120
You'll be forced to testify.

459
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,520
So I don't have a choice?

460
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,880
DOOR OPENS

461
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,720
DOOR SLAMS SHUT

462
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,920
I swear by Almighty God
that the evidence I shall give

463
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,880
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing by the truth.

464
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,520
Could you recount, Mr Stottor,

465
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,200
the events of that night
in April 1982,

466
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,520
when you met the defendant?

467
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:56,220
Where, for example,
did you meet Mr Nilsen?

468
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,520
In The Black Cap, Camden.

469
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,160
I was depressed.

470
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,260
I'd just broken up with someone.

471
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,080
Speak up, please, Mr Stottor.

472
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,520
He was nice to me.

473
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,240
In what sense was he nice?

474
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,560
He bought me drinks.

475
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,720
Er... He asked me about my family.

476
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,520
He asked if you had family?

477
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,520
Yes, and then he invited me
back to his flat for a drink.

478
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,120
Um... We just drank a lot
and then he said

479
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,520
I could go to sleep on his bed.

480
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,400
And then he warned me
not to get caught

481
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,520
in the zip of the sleeping bag.

482
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,040
Why do you think that was?

483
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,360
Was it perhaps because
he was planning an alibi

484
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,240
in case you managed to escape?
Objection, my Lord. Leading.

485
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,740
Sustained.

486
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,720
Tell us what happened next.

487
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,820
I woke up and I couldn't breathe.

488
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,680
He was behind me and...

489
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,560
I could feel
something digging into my neck.

490
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,880
The pressure got worse...

491
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,520
and the pain was unbearable.

492
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,780
I couldn't see,

493
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,160
or speak, or swallow.

494
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,580
And I could hear him saying,
"Keep still".

495
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,880
The next thing I knew,
I was in water.

496
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,660
In a bath. Being pushed down.
Again and again.

497
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:33,840
And I didn't know where I was
or what was happening.

498
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,320
And I swallowed water.

499
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,580
I couldn't resist any more
and I realised...

500
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,520
that I was dying.

501
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,060
Thank you, Mr Stottor.

502
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,840
No further questions, my Lord.

503
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,820
You have an alter-ego,
Mr Stottor, do you not?

504
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,140
Khara Le Fox.

505
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,520
A drag act.

506
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,200
You're a female impersonator.

507
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,080
I used to be, yes.

508
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,040
You've already been asked,
Mr Stottor,

509
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,820
if you could speak up

510
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,020
for the benefit of the court?

511
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,780
LOUDER: Yes.

512
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,820
But...

513
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:18,000
since the attack,
I'm not able to sing any more.

514
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,520
And you had several relationships
with men,

515
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,520
including one which became abusive.

516
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,340
Your night with Nilsen
was, therefore,

517
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,700
not your first violent
homosexual encounter...

518
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,280
My Lord, I must object
to this line of questioning.

519
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,520
A history of deviant encounters

520
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,020
raises the possibility
of a sex game gone wrong, my Lord.

521
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,000
Sustained. Move on, Mr Lawrence.

522
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,120
Now, could you tell us, Mr Stottor,

523
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,520
where you woke up
after you had been in the bath?

524
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,520
On the bed.

525
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,220
On the bed.
And was the room warm or cold?

526
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,060
Warm.

527
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,340
Nilsen had heated the room,
had he not?

528
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,520
He had put on all the bars
on the electric fire.

529
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,520
Yes, I suppose so.

530
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:10,040
And how long after you woke up
did you leave the flat?

531
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:15,320
Well, I kept falling asleep,
so maybe one or two days.

532
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:20,160
One or two days.
Did Nilsen keep you under duress?

533
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,520
No, but I was very confused...

534
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,020
and also in a lot of pain.

535
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,520
Did he, in fact, walk you to the
Tube station when you wanted to go?

536
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,080
Yes.

537
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,360
This supposedly cold
and calculating killer,

538
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,620
with every opportunity
to finish the job,

539
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:45,520
instead let you sleep
in a warm bed for days,

540
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,880
before seeing you home safely.

541
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,300
In fact,
aside from the incident itself,

542
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,080
did he not show you more
care and kindness that evening

543
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,940
than anyone else in your life
had done for a very long time?

544
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,520
Yes.

545
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,520
That's what I can't understand.

546
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,880
Is he my murderer or my saviour?

547
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,240
How peculiar that is.

548
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,560
No further questions, my Lord.

549
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,520
You may step down, Mr Stottor.

550
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,520
You did really well in there.

551
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,140
Listen, Carl...

552
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,780
I want to go home now.

553
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,520
CROWD CALLS OUT

554
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,240
MAN SHOUTS: He should
have killed you, you queer!

555
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,060
VOICES FADE

556
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,520
Mr Jay...

557
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,080
I feel I owe you an apology.

558
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,540
You were right.

559
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,140
He's not insane.

560
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,960
He knew exactly what he was doing.

561
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:30,100
As much then as he does now.

562
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:53,220
PHOTOGRAPHERS SHOUT

563
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,800
Detective, are you confident?

564
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,920
Do you think you'll get
justice for the victims, Detective?

565
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,840
'In the following days
you interviewed him at length.

566
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,520
'Is that correct?'

567
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,240
Yes, we interviewed him
for a total of 31 hours.

568
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,720
And in those 31 hours,

569
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,640
did Mr Nilsen ever mention
visions or voices in his head

570
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,840
telling him to commit his crimes?
No.

571
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,160
Did he ever show any signs at all

572
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,240
of being out of his mind,
so to speak,

573
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,880
or mentally unwell in any way?
No. Quite the opposite, in fact.

574
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,820
He seemed... calm.

575
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,720
Collected. In control.

576
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,060
Hardly a madman.
No.

577
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,040
Detective Chief Inspector Jay,

578
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,360
could you please tell the court,

579
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,400
for how long
have you been a police officer?

580
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,240
Almost 23 years.

581
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,520
And based on those
years of experience,

582
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:11,140
what is your professional
opinion of Dennis Nilsen?

583
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,200
I've seen criminals
in all shapes and sizes.

584
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:21,360
When they're on remand, they ask to
be visited by all sorts of people,

585
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,540
priests, rabbis, imams.

586
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,780
I even had a fella
who asked for a shaman.

587
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:32,560
Because most of them
are just wanting forgiveness.

588
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,400
Mr Nilsen's only visitor

589
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,860
in the eight months
whilst he was on remand

590
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,520
was a biographer.

591
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:45,600
In my opinion,
he's a remorseless coward

592
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,520
who killed innocent
and vulnerable men as they slept.

593
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,000
Thank you,
Detective Chief Inspector.

594
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,420
No further questions, my Lord.

595
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,540
Detective Chief Inspector,

596
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:00,520
you say you interviewed Nilsen
for 31 hours, yes?

597
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,520
That's right.

598
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,520
In all that time
of him talking almost incessantly,

599
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,180
did he ever mention
planning the murders at all?

600
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,520
No.

601
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,040
No further questions, my Lord.

602
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,200
You may step down, Officer.
Thank you.

603
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,520
We have an old Latin phrase
in the law,

604
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,240
"Res ipsa loquitur",

605
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,520
"The act speaks for itself."

606
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,000
What sort of man kills people,

607
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,080
lives with their bodies
rotting under the floorboards,

608
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,760
and flushes pieces of them
down the lavatory?

609
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:40,100
Do these seem to you the actions
of a man in his right mind?

610
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,280
If you think,
as we invite you to think,

611
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,520
and as the evidence surely shows,

612
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,320
that these crimes
were not planned or premeditated,

613
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,120
but were due to Nilsen's
seriously abnormal personality

614
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,520
and way of thinking,

615
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,520
then you will find him
not guilty of murder,

616
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,040
but guilty of manslaughter
by way of diminished responsibility.

617
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,880
That is the verdict
which we invite you to return.

618
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,720
What's taking them so long?

619
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,520
Same again? Wee ones?

620
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,460
DOOR OPENS

621
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,880
Madam Foreman of the jury.

622
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,340
Have you reached verdicts
on which you are all agreed?

623
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,880
No, we have not.

624
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,640
THEY SIGH

625
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,720
Might you reach a verdict if the
court sits until early evening?

626
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,180
I don't believe so, your Honour.

627
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,520
Very well.
You will retire overnight.

628
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,680
The court will reconvene
in the morning

629
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,180
where I will accept
a majority verdict.

630

acted as if HE were the judge,

Madam Foreman,

do you have a majority
on your verdicts?

We do.

Dennis Andrew Nilsen,

674
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,000
your victims
were innocent young men,

675
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:30,320
guilty only
of accepting your hospitality,

676
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:35,160
whereupon you ended their lives
cruelly and callously,

677
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,600
for reasons that will
remain known only to you.

678
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,520
The sentence for murder
is fixed in law.

679
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,840
It is imprisonment for life,

680
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,780
and that is the sentence
which I pass on you

681
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,520
on each count of this indictment.

682
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,520
Take him down.

683
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,520
DOOR SLAMS

684
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,900
INDISTINCT CONVERSATION

685
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,520
Mr Jay. Well done.

686
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,520
It went down to the wire
at the end, didn't it?

687
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,320
You must be pleased it's over.

688
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,520
If at any time in the future
you remember any more names...

689
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,520
..please write to me.

690
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,640
I promise
you'll be the first to know.

691
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,360
I think the jury got it right
in the end. Yeah.

692
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,520
I don't think I'm mad.

693
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,520
If you hadn't caught me that day...

694
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,200
..it'd be 115, not 15.

695
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,340
I could never have stopped.

696
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,520
OK.

697
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,420
Good luck.

698
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,380
What will you do with it all?

699
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,700
Oh, I don't know.
Chuck most of it, probably.

700
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,520
Mr Jay...um...

701
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,800
do you mind if I ask you a question?

702
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,880
Go on.

703
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,520
When you first met him,
did you believe him straight away?

704
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,820
Yes, I did.

705
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,080
What went through your mind
at that moment?

706
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,560
Well, I thought, um...

707
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,020
Honestly?

708
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,660
The first thing I thought was,
"I hope that I'm up to this."

709
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,180
Don't put that in your book.

710
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,880
You have my word.

711
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,460
And about my book...

712
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,960
No, look, it's fine.

713
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,080
We both had our way
of looking at this.

714
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,140
Well, what will they do
with this place?

715
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,160
I don't know.

716
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,400
Sell it or rent it out, I'd imagine.
Hm.

717
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,460
Who'd want to live here?
I mean, it's...

718
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,300
There's the smell for one thing.

719
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,240
D'you know the worst thing?

720
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,660
I don't smell it any more.

721
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,540
I'll see you outside.

722
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,700
So, how have you been?

723
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:35,820
Ah, you know. Adjusting to being
a permanent resident, and all.

724
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,700
Apart from that, not too bad.

725
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,380
I read your book. My book.

726
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,560
What did you think?

727
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:46,260
To be honest, Brian,
I found it absolutely terrifying.

728
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,520
But it's good.

729
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,000
Much better than I expected.
Of course, I have some thoughts.

730
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,140
Please don't be discouraged
by my observations.

731
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,860
I've lost none of my respect
or admiration for you,

732
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:01,840
or your work.

733
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,700
Oh, well, thank you. Um...

734
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,380
I'm sure it'll be very helpful.

735
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,080
My biggest concern is
you didn't name any of the victims.

736
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,520
No, I-I wanted to respect
their privacy.

737
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,540
Well, I think it's disrespectful
not naming them.

738
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,520
I robbed them of their life. Please
don't rob them of their identities.

739
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,000
And the title,

740
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,520
Killing For Company,
is a little...

741
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,520
Ah. It should just be Nilsen.

742
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:38,520
No.

743
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,420
Why not?

744
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,800
Book is about me, after all.

745
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,520
I'm not going to call it Nilsen.

746
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,360
This isn't your book.
It's not about you.

747
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,180
It's about how someone
like you came to be.

748
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,560
I told you when we first met

749
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,820
that I wasn't going to use
grisly or emotive adjectives,

750
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,000
and I have stuck to my word.

751
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,520
But make no mistake,

752
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,160
this isn't a celebration.

753
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,520
It's a warning.

754
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,160
You know, there were
only 12 victims, not 15.

755
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,720
When I sat in the back of the
police car the night of my arrest,

756
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,060
they asked me how many there were,
and I wasn't very sure,

757
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,520
so I just gave them a figure,
"15 or 16".

758
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,440
And three...three of those victims
were invented,

759
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,520
just to complement the continuity
of evidence for the police.

760
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,220
Keep them happy.

761
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,900
Everybody has had a chance
to write their version of my story.

762
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,340
When's it my turn?

763
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:51,860
I'll send you a copy
when it's published.

764
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,260
Come and see me again.

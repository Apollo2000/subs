2
00:00:06,119 --> 00:00:08,159
An exchange would be made
in return for information.

3
00:00:08,195 --> 00:00:10,643
What do you have to give
that I could possibly want?

4
00:00:10,727 --> 00:00:12,804
- Oslo have made Markus...
- He's our new governor.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,400
Are you all happy letting the town drunk

6
00:00:14,436 --> 00:00:16,035
just wander around
shooting a hunting rifle?

7
00:00:16,071 --> 00:00:18,012
He is not the town drunk!

8
00:00:18,507 --> 00:00:20,804
Hey, man. I got you. Whoa!

9
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,403
You're in good hands.

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,766
My husband has done this before.

11
00:00:24,802 --> 00:00:26,042
Do you want me, Boyd?

12
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:29,121
The parasites, wasps, larvae,
they're dead and gone.

13
00:00:29,157 --> 00:00:32,112
A single specimen was preserved
in cryogenic suspension.

14
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:33,346
I can't believe this.

15
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:36,000
They didn't get on a plane,
they're still here.

16
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,315
- Lars?
- Morning, Mr Ulvinaune.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

18
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,906
There.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,720
Out there. See 50 metres
below the escarpment?

20
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:09,706
- Yeah. Yeah, it's a rotor blade.
- From a helicopter.

21
00:02:09,777 --> 00:02:11,791
- Uh-uh.
- That's it.

22
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:14,539
Every last thing you need, baby.

23
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,119
Look, the reason Khatri's
body isn't in the wreckage

24
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:29,675
is because Spindoe
did what I told her to do.

25
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:33,080
Which was to throw her body
a thousand feet over the glacier.

26
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,314
Yeah, so where's the files, uh?

27
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:38,560
Somebody's been here recently,
been into the wreckage.

28
00:02:38,844 --> 00:02:42,964
Now whoever it was took all the
files, took all the hard drives.

29
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,004
- All of Khatri's research.
- Who?

30
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,829
Baby, I don't know who.

31
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,590
Well, we lost it, Boyd.

32
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,933
We lost it. All her work,
everything. We lost it.

33
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,640
Look, they had their orders.

34
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:58,320
Get rid of Khatri
and bring the files to you.

35
00:02:58,356 --> 00:02:59,777
They had their orders, Elsa.

36
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,885
Khatri was in the chopper
when they left Fortitude.

37
00:03:01,921 --> 00:03:03,284
That I know and...

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,119
What's that?

39
00:03:20,155 --> 00:03:22,314
Detective Sergeant Oby
left his laptop in the office.

40
00:03:23,032 --> 00:03:24,298
What are you reading?

41
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:26,338
His report into the
death of Governor Munk.

42
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:27,583
It's not finished, obviously.

43
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,021
Obviously.

44
00:03:30,552 --> 00:03:32,993
Cos they still need to speak to Lars.

45
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,220
But Lars has left town.

46
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:52,600
When you found me in the car crash...

47
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,479
When I woke up, and I was
hanging out of the wreckage

48
00:03:57,515 --> 00:04:00,875
and you were holding my head,
up on the hill...

49
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:02,542
What?

50
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,179
I thought you were gonna kill me then.

51
00:04:08,947 --> 00:04:10,667
I wondered that myself.

52
00:04:11,496 --> 00:04:13,612
But instead you set me free.

53
00:05:34,903 --> 00:05:37,343
- Hey.
- Hey.

54
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,035
I got you this.

55
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,970
You look terrible. What's the matter?

56
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:45,330
The matter?

57
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,040
Yeah, why does everybody look like

58
00:05:48,076 --> 00:05:50,646
they want to kill themselves
all the time just now?

59
00:05:51,921 --> 00:05:53,419
Natalie actually does.

60
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,327
Does what?

61
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,927
Want to kill herself.

62
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,080
Ever since her eyes went, she...
doesn't think she can continue.

63
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,044
Poor, poor Natalie. I should...

64
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,416
go and visit her.

65
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,640
- You can't.
- Why not?

66
00:06:13,844 --> 00:06:16,644
- Because she's gone.
- Gone?

67
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:19,539
Yeah, her dad came and
bundled her up and took her away.

68
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:25,424
That is the last
we'll ever see of Natalie Yelburton.

69
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,910
- You must be very sad.
- Not as sad as you might expect.

70
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:33,320
Bit of a relief, actually, in some ways.

71
00:06:33,619 --> 00:06:34,839
Really?

72
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,260
We should get another in.

73
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,420
I was in New York
when Bill recorded this.

74
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,503
We shared a dealer.

75
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,040
I know.

76
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,379
Cutaneous lesions
look like Kaposi sarcoma.

77
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,820
Macular, I think.

78
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,560
There's a word.

79
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,879
Means stain.

80
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,959
Immaculate conception
meant without stain.

81
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,800
Something in Larry turns out
to be incompatible.

82
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:05,879
I saw a donor.

83
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,400
I think nobody will be surprised
he didn't show up one day.

84
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,300
Somebody stinks of drink.

85
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,380
- You talking to me or the wasp?
- Is the wasp drunk?

86
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,000
The wasp is parasitic, not paralytic.

87
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,207
I may have had a drink.

88
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,069
Do you think anyone
could do this madness sober?

89
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,459
Let's do it.

90
00:09:02,239 --> 00:09:03,390
Do it.

91
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,879
- Left eye first?
- Both eyes.

92
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,529
Yes, please, left eye first.

93
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,520
- Can you feel that?
- What?

94
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,363
Nothing.

95
00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:34,694
Other eye.

96
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:40,080
Vince?

97
00:09:40,116 --> 00:09:41,260
Vince?

98
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,013
What?

99
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,939
- Fuck! Fucker tried to sting me.
- And?

100
00:09:50,134 --> 00:09:51,181
Erm...

101
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,560
I'm sorry, I've had a slight...
slight technical setback here.

102
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,520
You were... boozing
and now you've fucked this up!

103
00:10:00,685 --> 00:10:03,244
You just let a paralytic wasp
fuck your sightless eyeball,

104
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,508
so I'd climb down off your
moral high horse if I was you.

105
00:10:06,665 --> 00:10:07,865
Parasitic.

106
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,187
Petra?

107
00:10:29,642 --> 00:10:31,202
Can you reach my heart?

108
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,160
- What?
- You know... Touch the heart.

109
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,560
It's too dangerous.

110
00:10:39,596 --> 00:10:40,738
Here.

111
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,573
The shaman's way.

112
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,069
Round the side. Do it.

113
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,600
- No.
- Push it in.

114
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,360
Three inches. And no further.

115
00:11:00,396 --> 00:11:03,674
No. It might kill you.

116
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,879
- Let's find out.
- Find out what?

117
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,402
If you can.

118
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,097
Do it, Petra.

119
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,811
You're the only one who can do this.

120
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,780
I can't. I can't do this.

121
00:11:31,913 --> 00:11:33,913
That's it. Now.

122
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,360
Fuck me harder.

123
00:11:43,597 --> 00:11:45,083
Harder.

124
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,239
Now. Go on!

125
00:12:04,385 --> 00:12:05,582
Well done.

126
00:12:34,701 --> 00:12:36,769
What the fuck are you?

127
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,490
- You're not in pain?
- No.

128
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,757
You don't feel pain?

129
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:13,450
Briefly. Like... a white light.

130
00:13:14,116 --> 00:13:16,716
Where do you go
when you lose consciousness?

131
00:13:17,907 --> 00:13:19,826
What makes you think I go anywhere?

132
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,210
Because... you are talking to someone.

133
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:27,002
What about? Tell me.

134
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:30,970
You ask questions.
And someone is answering.

135
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:33,484
- Because you become angry.
- Who?

136
00:13:34,884 --> 00:13:37,644
- Who is answering?
- He has no name.

137
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,252
Hey.

138
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,973
Trude.

139
00:13:48,147 --> 00:13:49,509
Come on.

140
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,110
Not open yet, Michael.

141
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,966
Don't fuck around, Trude.
It's 12 o'clock.

142
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,390
You open at 12 o'clock.

143
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,458
That clock's fast.

144
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:13,350
- Hello.
- What can I get for you?

145
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,310
I would like...

146
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:22,509
- ..a bottle of vodka.
- OK.

147
00:14:24,808 --> 00:14:26,323
And two shot glasses.

148
00:14:28,641 --> 00:14:30,841
- Who is he?
- That guy?

149
00:14:31,656 --> 00:14:33,520
His name is Michael Lennox.

150
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,822
Thank you.

151
00:14:42,211 --> 00:14:43,225
Michael?

152
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,110
- Excuse me?
- She said you were Michael.

153
00:14:46,655 --> 00:14:48,194
Yes. Er...

154
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,230
Michael Lennox. That's my name.

155
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:55,085
- I have some questions.
- Questions?

156
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:58,230
You look so nervous, Michael.
Don't be nervous.

157
00:15:00,855 --> 00:15:02,550
Thank you.

158
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,227
Here you go.

159
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:05,915
May I?

160
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:11,070
Do you mind if I ask...
who the hell are you?

161
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,750
And er... What the hell...

162
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,989
..questions er...
do you wanna ask of me?

163
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,174
My name is Elsa.

164
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,630
And I wanna know what it's
like to live in this place.

165
00:15:29,472 --> 00:15:31,832
- Excuse me?
- For the last very many years,

166
00:15:31,868 --> 00:15:33,879
I lived in Los Angeles.

167
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:36,870
Every day the sun shines
like the day before,...

168
00:15:36,906 --> 00:15:38,906
...and the day before that, and...

169
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,029
Well, the next day would be the same.

170
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,753
We're all animals and
our bodies adapt and change

171
00:15:44,789 --> 00:15:46,789
if we alter our environment.

172
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,150
I wanna know what it feels
like to live in a place

173
00:15:51,186 --> 00:15:55,770
where my blood and the air
around my skin are at war.

174
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:59,029
Well, er...

175
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,390
Er...

176
00:16:01,674 --> 00:16:04,514
Thermals and a good fleece are...

177
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,230
...de rigueur...

178
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:09,946
in erm... Fortitude to prevent the er...

179
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,070
skin wars from er... starting.

180
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,429
Well...

181
00:16:17,465 --> 00:16:20,870
I want a man who knows this place well.

182
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,789
Who knows how to survive here.

183
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:28,629
Who can show me around
and take me to sea.

184
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:34,390
Take me inland to the ice fields
and the mountains.

185
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,760
To the ends of the earth.

186
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,650
To the ends of the earth.

187
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,329
You got anything better to do,
Michael Lennox?

188
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,798
This was next to the till.
Ralfi left it.

189
00:16:48,834 --> 00:16:49,874
Ralfi?

190
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,830
"Don't serve Michael Lennox any drinks.
He's barred for fighting."

191
00:16:52,866 --> 00:16:55,914
Ralfi, he's just kidding around.

192
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,808
- Michael...
- Hey.

193
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,993
You're not serving him with drink.
You served me with drink.

194
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:02,432
And now I'm serving him.

195
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:07,989
Please, Trude,
Michael and I are long lost friends.

196
00:17:08,471 --> 00:17:10,210
Why did you ask me his name, then?

197
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:15,070
It's been such a long time,
I wasn't sure it was him.

198
00:17:16,613 --> 00:17:18,294
We were lovers...

199
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:20,792
before he left America and came here.

200
00:17:21,286 --> 00:17:23,001
I've been searching all my life.

201
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,610
You... you and Michael.

202
00:17:26,029 --> 00:17:30,486
Well, that was... way,
way, way before I married Freya.

203
00:17:30,522 --> 00:17:33,162
- Does Ingrid know?
- Nobody knows.

204
00:17:35,509 --> 00:17:39,190
Well... maybe you can save him, then.

205
00:17:44,385 --> 00:17:45,918
Small towns.

206
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,087
Fuck all that.

207
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,950
To the ghost of our memories.

208
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,430
The ghost.

209
00:18:04,989 --> 00:18:08,350
Always the same with DIY.
Need a Phillips, only got a...

210
00:18:09,293 --> 00:18:13,553
I'm gonna be back later with the
correct and appropriate implement.

211
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:16,733
You warm enough?

212
00:18:17,552 --> 00:18:18,753
Bloody cold in here.

213
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:20,683
Course, we're underground in the Arctic,

214
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:22,519
traditionally a very cold environment.

215
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:26,554
Permafrost. Freeze the bollocks off
a woolly mammoth.

216
00:18:29,633 --> 00:18:30,733
Nat?

217
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,772
Can you hear me, Natalie?

218
00:18:38,989 --> 00:18:42,029
I'm preparing myself for the
moment when your personality

219
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,710
is subsumed to the greater
imperative of the parasitical larva

220
00:18:45,746 --> 00:18:49,651
and your humanity becomes
reduced to a vestigial remnant.

221
00:18:49,985 --> 00:18:51,344
Are we there yet?

222
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:53,644
Duh!

223
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:56,230
- Duh?
- No.

224
00:18:56,514 --> 00:18:58,194
We're not fucking there yet.

225
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,209
Good.

226
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,310
I'm freezing, Vincent.

227
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,750
I'm cold.

228
00:19:05,987 --> 00:19:07,945
And I'm s-shivering.

229
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,558
I feel sick.

230
00:19:09,686 --> 00:19:13,662
This... This was a fucking rubbish idea.

231
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,371
Is that better?

232
00:19:16,282 --> 00:19:18,601
Could I have a cuddle, please?

233
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,029
He's gone and the taxi's gone with him.

234
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:35,150
And now the party's just me and
this gorgeous girl named Freya,

235
00:19:35,186 --> 00:19:38,106
who didn't wanna share
a taxi with Big John.

236
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:41,817
So... I tell you, I'm kind of shaking.

237
00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:44,419
And we're just sitting. And er...

238
00:19:44,455 --> 00:19:45,776
So, I say, erm...

239
00:19:45,812 --> 00:19:49,639
"So, erm... where are you
sleeping tonight?"

240
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:52,070
And er... there's silence.

241
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:55,824
And then she looks right at me
and says...

242
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,989
"In your bed."

243
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:01,798
And I swear to God... I'm thinking...

244
00:20:02,053 --> 00:20:05,354
"Jesus, does this mean I'm gonna
have to sleep in the bathtub?"

245
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:09,787
Men are ridiculous
when a woman says what she wants.

246
00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:11,682
That's what I'm saying.
That's what I'm saying.

247
00:20:11,718 --> 00:20:14,877
Cos I couldn't believe my ears.
I mean, I couldn't believe my luck.

248
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,029
Here you go.

249
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:26,460
Will you er... excuse me?

250
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,115
Of course.

251
00:21:17,808 --> 00:21:19,034
What are you thinking?

252
00:21:22,516 --> 00:21:24,029
I'm thinking...

253
00:21:24,209 --> 00:21:27,793
Sergeant Oby kind of worships
his boss, don't you think?

254
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:31,387
To an unhealthy degree.
I mean, I never worshipped my boss.

255
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,429
You never worshipped Dan Anderssen?

256
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,910
Not even slightly.
Especially not these days.

257
00:21:36,946 --> 00:21:38,026
Why not?

258
00:21:39,936 --> 00:21:41,080
Eric.

259
00:21:41,116 --> 00:21:44,016
Come on. Dan has had some kind
of terrible mental breakdown.

260
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,089
We're all pretending
everything is normal.

261
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,838
Eric, you know this as well as I do.

262
00:21:47,874 --> 00:21:50,040
- Does Petra think the same?
- Petra is fucking him.

263
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:51,217
She is?

264
00:21:51,253 --> 00:21:54,270
Of course she is.
Are you completely oblivious

265
00:21:54,306 --> 00:21:56,284
to everything that's
going on around you?

266
00:21:57,092 --> 00:21:59,550
Dan's gone crazy. Petra's lost her mind.

267
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:02,514
- My dad is drinking himself to death.
- No, I knew that.

268
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,473
You're in a bubble of grief and denial.

269
00:22:04,509 --> 00:22:05,795
I'm not in a bubble.

270
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:09,600
What if our friends and neighbours
did murder Governor Munk?

271
00:22:09,636 --> 00:22:10,945
I'm not in a bubble...

272
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:13,674
Sheriff Anderssen? Sheriff? Eric! Eric!

273
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,914
There's been a shooting at Lars' cabin.
A man and a woman.

274
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,718
- Who?
- And Lars, Lars is dead.

275
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,047
I'll call Dan now.

276
00:22:20,395 --> 00:22:23,274
Ingrid, get Jock. Find Petra now!

277
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,501
Meet me outside.

278
00:23:14,506 --> 00:23:16,277
Dan? Dan?

279
00:23:16,616 --> 00:23:19,244
We're responding to a report
of a multiple homicide.

280
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,669
Three dead, maybe more.

281
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:24,029
Ingrid and me are heading out
to Lars Ulvinaune's cabin now.

282
00:23:24,245 --> 00:23:26,209
Get there as fast as you can. Over.

283
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:36,154
Don't respond. Let Eric deal with it.

284
00:23:36,426 --> 00:23:38,682
This is all his fault. You know that.

285
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:41,322
Let him and Ingrid work the scene.

286
00:23:44,364 --> 00:23:45,425
Stand up.

287
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:49,527
Stand up!

288
00:23:54,692 --> 00:23:58,152
You lost a lot of blood.
What have you been doing?

289
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:01,413
I asked Petra to stick
the shaman's knife into me.

290
00:24:05,324 --> 00:24:06,553
I won't have it.

291
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:09,350
You're the sheriff,

292
00:24:09,618 --> 00:24:14,219
not a ritualistic goddamn
sadomasochistic nutjob.

293
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,814
I know. I know.

294
00:24:18,946 --> 00:24:20,893
You should eat before you fall down.

295
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:24,264
Give Eric an hour
and then get out there.

296
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,029
Lars is dead inside the doorway.

297
00:24:36,065 --> 00:24:37,511
The killer could be inside.

298
00:24:38,198 --> 00:24:40,538
I know. Could be.

299
00:25:25,612 --> 00:25:26,887
It's clear.

300
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,082
DCI Myklebust.

301
00:25:43,233 --> 00:25:45,143
Shot in the centre of her forehead.

302
00:25:52,202 --> 00:25:53,513
She's dead!

303
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:56,234
Two shots fired.

304
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,750
Sergeant Oby.

305
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:00,276
One rifle shot through the chest.

306
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:15,589
There's no pulse. He's dead too.

307
00:26:30,241 --> 00:26:33,721
Lars shot Oby when he opened the door.

308
00:26:34,976 --> 00:26:38,112
Then Myklebust's first shot

309
00:26:38,741 --> 00:26:40,035
missed Lars.

310
00:26:41,177 --> 00:26:45,197
The second shot
nearly took his head off.

311
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:51,054
Yeah, and Lars shot DCI Myklebust
straight between the eyes.

312
00:26:51,238 --> 00:26:53,959
Bang! Bang! They both shot
in the same split-second.

313
00:26:53,995 --> 00:26:55,914
If it was "Bang! Bang!"
only one would be dead...

314
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,393
the second would have missed.

315
00:26:57,429 --> 00:26:59,470
So it must have just been "Bang!"

316
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,817
We set up a perimeter.

317
00:27:02,409 --> 00:27:04,024
Fingertip snow search.

318
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:07,329
Anything doesn't look
right in the scenario,

319
00:27:07,365 --> 00:27:11,136
we put up a numbered plastic cup
over the fucker.

320
00:27:11,703 --> 00:27:13,651
Where the hell is Dan Anderssen?

321
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,470
Completely raw?

322
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:33,919
Are you on some kind of
faddish new diet, Dan?

323
00:27:33,955 --> 00:27:35,721
Ralfi, just give me the fucking meat.

324
00:27:36,163 --> 00:27:37,163
Mm-hmm.

325
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,470
Enjoy.

326
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:04,748
- What?
- You're the sheriff.

327
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,490
Dan Anderssen, the sheriff of Fortitude.

328
00:28:08,674 --> 00:28:10,594
That's what it says on my big furry hat.

329
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,630
I'm Elsa Schenthal.

330
00:28:21,124 --> 00:28:24,830
Schenthal Pharmaceuticals
funded Dr Khatri.

331
00:28:24,866 --> 00:28:27,242
Bankrolled Erling Munk.

332
00:28:27,878 --> 00:28:31,281
Sent a bunch of killers and hitmen
out here to kidnap me.

333
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:33,270
We're past all that now.

334
00:28:33,306 --> 00:28:35,027
- We are?
- Yes.

335
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:39,572
After the experiments
a lab rat doesn't have any value.

336
00:28:39,788 --> 00:28:41,727
- A lab rat?
- I was one too.

337
00:28:42,705 --> 00:28:44,185
You were a lab rat?

338
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:47,514
The circumstances
that created you and me,

339
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,710
I've been researching this all my life,

340
00:28:49,746 --> 00:28:52,114
created 19 others like us.

341
00:28:52,947 --> 00:28:54,200
The parasite.

342
00:28:54,895 --> 00:28:56,724
18 of you and one of me.

343
00:28:58,158 --> 00:28:59,558
One of you?

344
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:02,437
Well, the rest never made it
beyond a couple of years, so...

345
00:29:02,473 --> 00:29:04,832
Mmh. So er...

346
00:29:05,097 --> 00:29:06,509
How long did you make it?

347
00:29:07,194 --> 00:29:08,594
- Since infection.
- Uh.

348
00:29:08,895 --> 00:29:12,601
Well, that was er... 73 years ago.

349
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:15,289
Ha ha.

350
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,196
I owe you recompense.

351
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:24,870
This... is not what you need.

352
00:29:25,656 --> 00:29:26,847
Well...

353
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,942
So, what do I need?

354
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,535
Cerebrospinal fluid.

355
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,550
- Human?
- Yes, of course.

356
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,554
It contains neuroendocrine factors,

357
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:41,586
which seem to have enabled renewal.

358
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,620
So, let me be clear about this.

359
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:50,564
Cos, er... I can't imagine
there's a queue of donors.

360
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,150
I'm assuming you have to...

361
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:58,190
harvest this cerebrospinal fluid
from living human beings.

362
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,509
That's correct.

363
00:29:59,793 --> 00:30:01,874
That become dead human beings?

364
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:04,735
They have to be alive
during the extraction.

365
00:30:04,771 --> 00:30:08,830
But, yes... nobody's going home
at the end of the day.

366
00:30:09,154 --> 00:30:11,429
- Apart from you, Elsa.
- Dan...

367
00:30:11,714 --> 00:30:15,194
You will be obsessively drawn
to near-death experience

368
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,230
and a desire to connect
with all the people you kill.

369
00:30:18,394 --> 00:30:23,114
Alongside this will be...
terrible numbing of empathy.

370
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:27,490
Complete confusion regarding
your moral purpose, any purpose.

371
00:30:28,497 --> 00:30:31,834
You will encounter
a menagerie of plagues, boils,

372
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:34,074
decrepitudes and infirmities.

373
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:37,070
You will become mad,
you will become lost.

374
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:40,270
Then if you survive that,
you will become death.

375
00:30:43,423 --> 00:30:45,543
I am not a parasite.

376
00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:54,950
When you become desperate,
come and find me.

377
00:31:10,121 --> 00:31:12,594
Haemorrhaging all across the sclera.

378
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,550
- From the gunshot?
- Maybe...

379
00:31:14,796 --> 00:31:17,436
Though I would associate this
with strangulation.

380
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:19,390
Gunshot to the throat like this...

381
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,989
would instantly reduce
blood pressure to the head.

382
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,750
And no haemorrhaging would result.

383
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:41,194
- What are you doing?
- What?

384
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,710
- This is a fucking crime scene!
- What?

385
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,550
You're contaminating a murder scene.

386
00:31:45,586 --> 00:31:47,234
- I'm contaminating...
- Yes!

387
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,270
What the hell is this clown
playing at here?

388
00:31:49,306 --> 00:31:51,209
I am the interim governor.

389
00:31:51,889 --> 00:31:56,250
And the Governor of Fortitude is
also the Chief of Fortitude Police.

390
00:32:02,632 --> 00:32:04,512
You fucking...

391
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,750
You can sure hold the liquor.

392
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,327
You see, my belief is that...

393
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:27,750
her metabolism produces way more
than the average dehydrogenase,

394
00:32:27,786 --> 00:32:30,569
which denatures the ethanol
in the vodka.

395
00:32:32,275 --> 00:32:33,561
Whatever.

396
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:37,190
That's the chloroform I used
making you sick.

397
00:32:37,518 --> 00:32:39,738
Mixed in with all the vodka
that she fed you.

398
00:32:40,813 --> 00:32:43,693
It's best if you get it all out
so you don't choke.

399
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:47,173
Please, would you untie me?

400
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,989
This is not good.
I didn't do anything...

401
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:52,847
..to you.

402
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:57,243
Please, you got it wrong.

403
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:03,889
If this is about that woman
at the bar... I don't know her.

404
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,310
I'm just er... a guy in the bar.

405
00:33:08,757 --> 00:33:10,214
Nobody.

406
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,732
Just a guy that drinks.

407
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:16,310
No. No, don't... Stop.

408
00:33:16,841 --> 00:33:19,314
Please. No, don't. Don't. Don't. Don't.

409
00:33:19,412 --> 00:33:21,612
No! No, no!

410
00:33:21,955 --> 00:33:23,517
No! No!

411
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:26,581
You fucker!

412
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,910
You are not to blame.

413
00:33:38,329 --> 00:33:40,055
You know what an enchantress is?

414
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,274
Yeah. That's what she is.

415
00:33:48,939 --> 00:33:50,506
Make sure you get some rest.

416
00:35:43,946 --> 00:35:45,470
Jesus.

417
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,210
Did I hurt you?

418
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:53,009
Yeah. Yes.

419
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:57,124
Yes, you fucking hurt me.
You broke my fucking nose.

420
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:02,294
I'm so sorry. It wasn't personal.

421
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,411
What?

422
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:05,929
It's over now. I can't reach you.

423
00:36:08,485 --> 00:36:10,567
- What is?
- The parasite.

424
00:36:10,946 --> 00:36:12,685
I have no control.

425
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:16,133
Natalie... Natalie had no control.

426
00:36:16,169 --> 00:36:18,250
My fucking head.

427
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:22,530
It does sound like your nose
is broken, the sound of your voice.

428
00:36:23,575 --> 00:36:25,654
You should go to A&E, get it seen to.

429
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:28,689
- Fucking right.
- And more chain.

430
00:36:31,009 --> 00:36:34,646
I need to be restrained
on my wrists and ankles.

431
00:36:35,764 --> 00:36:37,973
I can't fight it
when it grabs me like that.

432
00:36:38,009 --> 00:36:41,210
There's no... negotiation,
no discussion.

433
00:36:41,246 --> 00:36:43,207
It's just... boom!

434
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:44,409
More restraints.

435
00:36:47,587 --> 00:36:48,655
Er...

436
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,961
I bought you a heater, if you get cold.

437
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,397
Thanks, Vince.

438
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:00,494
You're really kind and thoughtful
and I appreciate it.

439
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,890
Fuck you!

440
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:15,800
Aaaargh! Aaargh!

441
00:38:23,169 --> 00:38:25,850
It's all good. It's all good.

442
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,886
It's all good.

443
00:38:43,444 --> 00:38:45,878
As soon as I've... I've got her home,

444
00:38:46,226 --> 00:38:48,265
we'll get this over and done with?

445
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,457
Hey.

446
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:16,650
Aargh!

447
00:42:20,529 --> 00:42:22,330
Urgh!

448
00:42:55,009 --> 00:42:57,009
Aaargh!

449
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:23,650
- Untie me.
- I'm not going to untie you.

450
00:45:23,686 --> 00:45:26,334
- This isn't healthy.
- You're bloody telling me it isn't.

451
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:28,621
How the fuck do you
explain having a woman

452
00:45:28,657 --> 00:45:30,294
bondaged up in your basement?

453
00:45:30,389 --> 00:45:32,108
Boyd!

454
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,334
Elsa.

455
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:39,210
I want a SIG Sauer P226 X5 tactical,

456
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:41,850
with a custom Hogue grip
and tritium sights.

457
00:45:42,976 --> 00:45:44,494
Put down the gun.

458

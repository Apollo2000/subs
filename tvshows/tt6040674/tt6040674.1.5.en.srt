1
00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:14,467
Do you know the mood
within the compound?

2
00:00:14,767 --> 00:00:16,433
Well, our intel is saying

3
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:19,733
that people are starting to
question their loyalty to Koresh.

4
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:22,447
How many people
are still inside?

5
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:24,633
We estimate 130.

6
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:27,500
Is there any concern for the
possibility of a mass suicide?

7
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,000
All possibilities are a concern.

8
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:35,033
Have you been talking to the White
House about what's going on?

9
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:38,000
Yes. They are apprised
of the situation.

10
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:40,600
Sir, what do think it will take
for them to come out?

11
00:00:41,367 --> 00:00:45,067
Apparently, a sign from God.

12
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:24,600
I don't understand, Gary.

13
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:27,533
- Why did you shut our power off?
- Look, you gotta understand.

14
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:30,867
The negotiators do not get
100% of the input, okay?

15
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:33,300
The tactical side,
they have a say in it, as well.

16
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,800
Our position is moving forward.

17
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:38,767
I thought we made
a lot of progress yesterday

18
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,676
delivering you that milk
with Sheriff Harwell.

19
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,867
Me, too.
Which is why I'm confused.

20
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:45,567
I mean, you send in milk for the
kids, then turn off the power

21
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,700
so it goes bad. I mean,
where's the sense in that?

22
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,767
My bosses have it in their minds

23
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,333
that this might become
another Jonestown.

24
00:01:58,467 --> 00:02:01,667
Another Jonestown?
Wait a second.

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,667
Do you think that we are going
to kill ourselves?

26
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,133
Well, frankly, Steve, I don't
know what you're thinking.

27
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:10,633
Gary, do you honestly believe
that I would spend

28
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:13,367
this much time on the phone
with you if that was our plan?

29
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,367
We're trying to find a solution.

30
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,833
A solution that will take us
back to the life we had

31
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:19,700
before you came in here
and ruined it.

32
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,067
I am, too.

33
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:22,533
Now, what I'd really like to do

34
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:24,733
is take advantage
of the good stuff

35
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:27,067
that happened yesterday
and keep moving forward.

36
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:30,067
- Do you think we can do that?
- Look. What I want you to do

37
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:32,567
is tell our bosses we are not
going to kill ourselves.

38
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,500
That is not what we're about.

39
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:36,133
I will.

40
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,600
Is David there?
I'd like to talk to him.

41
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:40,167
David's not gonna
talk to you again

42
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,867
until you turn
our electricity back on.

43
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:48,333
Lack of electricity
makes them less comfortable

44
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:50,167
and more willing to compromise.

45
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,100
Under normal circumstances, yes.

46
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:53,243
But these people,
they already know

47
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:54,667
how to live with nothing.

48
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,700
All you're doing
is pissing 'em off.

49
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:01,313
- Mitch feels differently.
- You know, sir,

50
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,700
with you talking
to Mitch and I separately,

51
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,433
it feels like we're operating
at cross purposes here.

52
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:08,733
It's been nine days.

53
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:11,367
How much longer
do I let this go on?

54
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,533
As long as it takes.

55
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:15,433
Do you know
what this is costing taxpayers?

56
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:17,727
God damn it, I'm not worried
about taxpayers right now.

57
00:03:18,433 --> 00:03:21,200
Gary, we need to bring this
to a resolution.

58
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,433
Look...

59
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,867
Koresh has been bullied
his entire life.

60
00:03:28,067 --> 00:03:29,433
Here we go.

61
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:31,567
The more you let HRT do
what they did last night,

62
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,333
the more he's gonna dig in.

63
00:03:33,467 --> 00:03:34,733
He's let people out.

64
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:36,567
That shows he's willing to work
with us.

65
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,833
But we've gotta meet that
with positive reinforcement,

66
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:40,333
not punishment.

67
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:42,433
You wanna train a dog
to fetch your newspaper?

68
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:43,833
Do you kick him in the balls

69
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:45,967
every time he brings it
back to ya?

70
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,900
No.

71
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:48,933
I'm sorry, Tony.

72
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,500
We both want the same thing.
You know that, right?

73
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,867
But in order to get it,
we gotta turn the power back on!

74
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,333
- Morning.
- Morning.

75
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,633
Your mom...
it's sweet what she did.

76
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:38,867
Yeah, it was kind of
embarrassing.

77
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,433
I wish my mom
did something like that.

78
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:48,233
- Yeah, what happened to her?
- She left.

79
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:51,900
Right after I joined
the House of David.

80
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,800
She didn't like
how that happened.

81
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:58,367
What... what's that like?

82
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:03,433
Being married to David?

83
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:13,600
It's...

84
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,067
it's like...

85
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,800
being married to the most
special person in the world.

86
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:24,367
But not being special yourself.

87
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:31,833
You're special to me.

88
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,067
You're special to me, too.

89
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,967
David wants you to try
and get that generator working.

90
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:47,067
That thing hasn't worked
forever.

91
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:49,733
I know, but you know,
do what you...

92
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,533
Hey! I take that back.

93
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:02,233
Hey, Thibs,
will you turn that up for me?

94
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:04,767
Still no sign
of surrender. Robert...

95
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,733
See what they're saying
about us now.

96
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,700
Joins us now
live with the latest. Robert?

97
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:12,467
We've just learned that the Branch
Davidians who left Mt. Carmel

98
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,200
have been arrested.

99
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,067
Also, a judge has declared
those remaining inside

100
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,567
to be unfit parents.

101
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,067
Child Services
has been brought in

102
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,767
to handle the situation
as it unfolds.

103
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,567
How dare you call us
"unfit parents"?

104
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,433
When was the last time
you saw your kids, Gary?

105
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:30,167
I see mine every day.

106
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,100
The judge doesn't know you
or your people, David.

107
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:37,700
Which is why you need to come out
and tell your side of things.

108
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,833
I'd love to tell
my side of things, Gary,

109
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:41,833
but you won't let us speak
to the press.

110
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:44,067
Every time I turn that TV on,

111
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:47,233
all I see is "David Koresh,
the fanatic."

112
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:48,700
David Koresh, the antagonist."

113
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,167
Well, from what I can see,

114
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,843
there's an awful lot
of sympathy for you

115
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:53,200
and a lot of anger
towards the ATF

116
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,500
in all parts of the country.

117
00:06:55,367 --> 00:07:00,067
It's in your interest to come out now,
and not have that sentiment turn.

118
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:03,200
You know, you sure like putting all
the pressure on us to come out,

119
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,200
when what you should be doing
is just back off.

120
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,567
Let time take its toll.

121
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,200
Do you understand?

122
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,933
It's not our desire
to die in here, Gary.

123
00:07:11,067 --> 00:07:12,367
I understand,

124
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,243
and I've been trying
to buy time with my bosses,

125
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,043
- but it's very difficult...
- Buy time for what?

126
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:17,800
Before you come in here
full force?

127
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:21,067
No. Buy the time...

128
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:22,467
you need, you know,

129
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,100
to pray and talk to your God.

130
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:30,233
Tell me, Gary...

131
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:32,767
who's your God?

132
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:35,800
You do believe in God, don't ya?

133
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:40,200
I don't know what I believe.

134
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,833
Well, how do you think
all this started, Gary?

135
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:45,400
Do you think iit's all
just random?

136
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:47,467
It's all one big coincidence?

137
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,067
That a proton collided with a neutron
and that's how it all got started?

138
00:07:52,133 --> 00:07:56,400
Well, who created that proton, Gary?
Who created that neutron?

139
00:07:57,433 --> 00:08:00,867
How did the universe
get this possibility?

140
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,400
The kids, David... let's talk
about sending more of 'em out.

141
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:09,700
Gary, I know.

142
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,467
I know you don't like talking
about religion.

143
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,900
But religion is all I am.

144
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:18,133
- Right, but the kids are what...
- Listen to me!

145
00:08:18,267 --> 00:08:22,467
Listen. Listen carefully. These
kids in here are my children,

146
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,833
and they ain't coming out!

147
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:28,233
Especially to someone
who doesn't even believe in God.

148
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,400
That's hard.

149
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:44,267
Well, everything's hard
until you practice it, right?

150
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,100
Trust me.

151
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:48,673
By your birthday, I'm gonna have
you playing like John Bonham.

152
00:08:56,733 --> 00:08:59,667
Are you gonna leave us,
Thibodeau?

153
00:09:03,433 --> 00:09:04,433
Let's try again.

154
00:09:08,233 --> 00:09:10,900
Do these kids seem abused
to you?

155
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:13,200
- No, they sure don't.
- Yeah.

156
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,900
I've seen abused kids.
They don't act like this.

157
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:19,433
These children are loved.

158
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:22,167
Their parents must be
suffering to be without 'em.

159
00:09:22,933 --> 00:09:24,633
But Koresh won't send out
any more kids.

160
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:27,233
We need to start
working on the parents.

161
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,100
Okay. How do we do that?

162
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:32,967
Go get the camera.

163
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,100
What?

164
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,967
- Hello.
- You lied to me.

165
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,033
- Who's this?
- Kathy Schroeder.

166
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:07,000
I saw that tape you sent.

167
00:10:07,133 --> 00:10:09,567
I gave my children over to you
and you lied to me!

168
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,733
Get Gary!

169
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,633
I'm sorry, Kathy. You have me
at a bit of a disadvantage.

170
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:18,343
I'm not sure
what we're talking about here.

171
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,900
Danny!
I mean, where are his brothers?

172
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:25,367
They're supposed to be together! Danny
is only three and he's all alone!

173
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,600
I don't know why your sons
would be separated.

174
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:29,300
Wait.

175
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:33,800
The father took them.
Now, why didn't he take Danny?

176
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,000
Well, Danny's not his.

177
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:39,167
He belongs to Mike.
You know, my second husband...

178
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,100
who you killed?

179
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:45,900
I need you to get Danny
to his brothers.

180
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:49,800
Okay? They'll look after him. I
need you to make Dale understand.

181
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:53,667
Kathy, your first husband
has no legal right to Danny.

182
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,200
Well, nobody told me that! You...

183
00:10:56,967 --> 00:11:00,400
God, you guys are like...!
I mean, first you killed Mike,

184
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:02,400
and now Danny's just all alone!

185
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:04,100
This is not right.

186
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:07,167
- This is not right.
- Kathy...

187
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,067
I'm so sorry. I can only imagine
what you're going through.

188
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:13,933
But sometimes when it comes
to children,

189
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:16,667
it's necessary to set aside
what we need

190
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,400
for their needs.

191
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:21,400
And right now...

192
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:23,067
you know
what Danny needs most...

193
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:26,133
is a hug from his mommy.

194
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:40,233
Shh...

195
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,400
God...!

196
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:48,800
Okay.

197
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:54,600
Okay.

198
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:56,433
I'm coming out.

199
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,067
I'm sorry.

200
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,667
The ATF believe these guys

201
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,800
were converting semiautomatic
weapons into automatics.

202
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:32,967
Now, in Texas, that's illegal.
Unless...

203
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,600
you purchase a $25 permit,
in which case, it's fine.

204
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:40,433
This is Ron Engelman, reminding
you to pay your parking tickets,

205
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:44,800
because the ATF is in town
and they're hunting Americans.

206
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:52,233
I noticed you've been sleeping
in your car the last few nights.

207
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,067
Yeah, well,
there's a lot of press in town.

208
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,133
I can't get a room
at a decent rate.

209
00:12:57,267 --> 00:12:58,500
I got a room.

210
00:12:58,633 --> 00:13:00,267
With two beds in it,
if you like.

211
00:13:01,067 --> 00:13:03,700
Thank you,
but I... got myself a pillow

212
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,109
and my seat folds
all the way back.

213
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:07,533
- So, I'm good.
- Okay. Look.

214
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:10,633
I know you blame me
for everything that's happened.

215
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:13,800
And I'll be the first to admit
I was not the best mother.

216
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,900
I had David when I was 14.

217
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,100
It's no excuse, but what 14yearold
knows how to raise a child?

218
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:26,100
We don't have the luxury
to not like one another.

219
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:30,967
We both want the same thing. We both
want our boys to come out of there.

220
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,900
Okay. Okay.

221
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,067
I had my son when I was 16.

222
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:48,167
I didn't have it
figured out either.

223
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,967
My offer stands
if you change your mind.

224
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,200
It's room 47. Okay?

225
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:05,043
Serenity mentioned
it's her birthday next week.

226
00:14:05,067 --> 00:14:06,667
You planning anything?

227
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,767
It's not really an appropriate
time to celebrate.

228
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,533
That's not how it works. Can't not
have a party on your birthday.

229
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:18,467
Everyone's spirit's down.

230
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:20,867
All the more reason
to lift it up.

231
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:22,347
I can help you plan something...

232
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,533
Thanks, Thibs,
but not now, okay?

233
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:28,433
I'm sorry. Just not now.

234
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:39,267
Kathy, put your heart to wisdom.

235
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:42,167
Think this through.

236
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,233
These are the people
that murdered your husband.

237
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:49,067
I know.

238
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,300
It... it's not an easy decision,

239
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,767
but Danny needs me.

240
00:14:55,533 --> 00:14:58,133
Well, if your desire is stronger
than your loyalty to God,

241
00:14:58,267 --> 00:14:59,509
then we have our answer,
don't we?

242
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:00,600
David...

243
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,833
I know God is here. I know that.

244
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:06,667
- It's... it's all coming true...
- If you're gonna go, go.

245
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:11,233
If you're looking for my
blessing, you ain't getting it.

246
00:15:14,467 --> 00:15:16,067
Go.

247
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:19,067
Go on.

248
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:31,300
- Take Brad with you.
- Me?

249
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:37,333
I heard you were drinking.
Is that the truth?

250
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,567
We are all one body here.

251
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,167
And for that body to work properly,
we all need to be in harmony.

252
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,600
If one finger isn't working,

253
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:48,667
or if someone decides
to go out on their own...

254
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,600
- David...
- Then we're all out of harmony.

255
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:54,967
This is God's test,
and you failed miserably.

256
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,740
- Calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

257
00:15:56,867 --> 00:15:58,900
I'm protecting us.

258
00:16:03,467 --> 00:16:05,233
You're done here.

259
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:08,433
Steve, let 'em out.

260
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:11,900
Kathy...

261
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,967
Sir, do you copy?

262
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,900
I have two targets in my view.
Over.

263
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:01,933
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Everyone! Just calm down!

264
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:05,133
Keep your hands in the air
and get on the ground, now!

265
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,500
I was right there.

266
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:20,167
- I tried to stop it.
- I know you did.

267
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,367
God's not speaking to me
anymore.

268
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:39,200
I have no idea
what I'm gonna do.

269
00:17:44,067 --> 00:17:46,067
You know, you always say.

270
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,467
"To trust God
in the light's easy, but...

271
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,233
to trust Him
in the dark, that's faith."

272
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,100
- What's happening?
- I don't know?

273
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:48,400
Everything you tell me
is a lie, Gary.

274
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:50,933
No, Everything I tell you
is not a lie.

275
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:53,867
I'm not the one who drove that
vehicle onto your property, David.

276
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:56,733
I don't wanna hear it.
We aren't afraid of the government.

277
00:18:56,867 --> 00:18:58,767
Big Brother wants to
come in here and fight,

278
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,567
we will fight back.

279
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,900
I think
we've proven that before.

280
00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:05,409
And as long as our flag is still
flying, I'm gonna defend it.

281
00:19:05,433 --> 00:19:07,333
As an American citizen,

282
00:19:07,467 --> 00:19:09,633
anyone that steps
on my property,

283
00:19:09,767 --> 00:19:12,309
anyone that destroys my property,
is gonna get their ass whupped.

284
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:15,533
Look, I would feel exactly the same
way if I was in your position.

285
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:19,067
But, the thing is, these guys
are frustrated, too.

286
00:19:19,933 --> 00:19:22,867
And they don't wanna be here any
more than you want them here.

287
00:19:23,067 --> 00:19:26,133
But try as I might,
I cannot get them to understand

288
00:19:26,267 --> 00:19:28,467
somebody waiting
for a sign from God.

289
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,867
It's just not part
of their worldview.

290
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:37,633
I get that, Gary.

291
00:19:37,767 --> 00:19:39,887
But we can get through this
if we work together, okay?

292
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:44,200
Now I want you to sit tight.
I'm gonna go talk to my bosses

293
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,133
and try and get those tanks
off your property.

294
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,567
Okay?

295
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:52,767
Okay. All right.

296
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:57,327
Do you realize
I'm getting all my information

297
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,833
about what we're doing
from the Branch Davidians?

298
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,009
Maybe you should move in
with them.

299
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:04,400
God damn it!

300
00:20:06,233 --> 00:20:08,367
Why did you send
that damn tank in there?

301
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:12,267
Because when I went to pick up
those people,

302
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,400
I noticed several vantage points where
they could hide and fire on our agents.

303
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:19,767
I had to mitigate
their strategic advantage.

304
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,876
You didn't try to "mitigate
their strategic advantage."

305
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,433
You're trying to irritate them
into coming out!

306
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:27,600
It's not a winning strategy!

307
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:30,867
What's not a winning strategy is
"waiting for a sign from God."

308
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,967
- Sir, I...
- No.

309
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,033
I'm tired of buying you time. You
need to tell them to come out.

310
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:40,467
It's been 17 days, Gary.

311
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,633
- I've been pushing 'em.
- Not hard enough.

312
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:45,867
I'm under an awful lot of
pressure to get them out.

313
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,467
I have the attorney general and
every politician in Washington

314
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,267
breathing down my neck!

315
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,467
I want them outta there
by tomorrow morning!

316
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,300
I can't give 'em a deadline.
I've tried that before.

317
00:20:58,433 --> 00:21:00,300
It doesn't work.
Now, time is on our side...

318
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:03,467
Time is not on our side. Now,
give them the deadline. Now.

319
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,500
No.

320
00:21:12,067 --> 00:21:14,167
I won't do that.

321
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,067
Get Koresh on the phone.

322
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,200
Whoa, Tony. What are you doing?

323
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,400
Hey...

324
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:36,200
Hello?

325
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,067
- David?
- Yes?

326
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,833
This is Tony Prince, Special
Agent in Charge for the FBI.

327
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,167
If you don't come out of there
by morning...

328
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:49,600
certain actions will be taken
against you and your people.

329
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:53,367
That's not a threat,
it's a promise.

330
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:10,767
This is the CBS Evening News.

331
00:22:12,167 --> 00:22:13,600
Good evening,
Dan Rather reporting.

332
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:16,167
That heavilyarmed cult
in central Texas

333
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,767
is showing no signs
of surrender.

334
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,400
Indeed, it shows all signs
of defiance.

335
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:23,933
Vicki Mabrey is on the scene
covering for us near Waco, Texas.

336
00:22:24,067 --> 00:22:27,067
The standoff outside
the Branch Davidian compound

337
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:29,067
has become
a psychological power struggle

338
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:32,467
between federal agents
and cult leader David Koresh.

339
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,167
The FBI is restocking
its own arsenal,

340
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,600
borrowing Abrams tanks
from the defense department.

341
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:39,967
Now, sources tell CBS News

342
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,667
that federal agents don't plan
to let this go on indefinitely.

343
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,933
Their frustration level
is very high

344
00:22:45,067 --> 00:22:47,500
and if negotiations
are not more fruitful,

345
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:50,167
they may take action
by this weekend.

346
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,533
I think we should probably just
prepare everyone for another attack.

347
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:55,600
We don't know
they're going to do that.

348
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:57,333
Yeah, but we don't know
that they're not.

349
00:22:57,467 --> 00:22:59,109
Steve, what do you think
that they are gonna do?

350
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:00,900
We can just leave.

351
00:23:01,067 --> 00:23:03,900
The minute we walk out those
doors, we're admitting guilt.

352
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:06,400
I don't know, guilt versus death.
Is there a decision?

353
00:23:06,533 --> 00:23:09,067
Yeah. Spending the rest
of your life in jail,

354
00:23:09,133 --> 00:23:10,933
or death. Some decision.

355
00:23:11,067 --> 00:23:12,567
This is why we need a lawyer.

356
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,867
- No offense, Wayne.
- None taken.

357
00:23:15,067 --> 00:23:16,633
Well, they barely gave us milk.

358
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:18,700
Do you think they're gonna
give us a lawyer?

359
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:21,700
No, Judy's right. The chances
of that are as good as them...

360
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,300
Hey, David.

361
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:28,667
What's going on?

362
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,767
- We're just talking.
- About...?

363
00:23:34,233 --> 00:23:37,600
- About our options.
- Options?

364
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:39,900
Steven...

365
00:23:40,067 --> 00:23:42,933
you of all people know
there's only one option.

366
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:47,700
Wayne...

367
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:50,233
you wanna go out there,
be with your family?

368
00:23:50,367 --> 00:23:52,733
Or do you wanna feel
the hand of God?

369
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:54,633
You are my family, David.

370
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,900
Judy, do you wanna stay
or do you wanna leave?

371
00:24:00,733 --> 00:24:02,867
I don't wanna leave without you.

372
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,067
Thibodeau?

373
00:24:06,233 --> 00:24:09,400
Go on. Take the easy way out.

374
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:13,133
- I...
- David.

375
00:24:13,267 --> 00:24:15,433
You owe it to us to tell us
what you're thinking.

376
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:18,900
No. I owe you nothing.

377
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:25,767
You are not the only one
that's suffering here.

378
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:30,500
- Don't you forget that.
- Don't forget... why we're here.

379
00:24:30,633 --> 00:24:32,600
This is our "withering."

380
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,067
Y'all wanna miss out
on the miracle?

381
00:24:39,433 --> 00:24:41,067
Be my guest.

382
00:24:50,233 --> 00:24:52,400
Get outta my chapel.

383
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,767
Sir, I apologize for my
outburst, but I'd...

384
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,067
I'd really appreciate if you'd
reconsider your ultimatum.

385
00:25:08,433 --> 00:25:10,067
Gary, please sit down.

386
00:25:15,633 --> 00:25:17,800
How many kids do you have?

387
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:21,600
- Three.
- I have two myself.

388
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:26,800
Your wife...
she understands the job?

389
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:31,667
Well, she was a secretary in the
Bureau when we met, so she gets it.

390
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,067
My wife, she...

391
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:40,067
she pretends to get it.
But she doesn't.

392
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:44,733
- Where did you grow up?
- Atlantic Beach, Florida.

393
00:25:44,867 --> 00:25:46,267
Now, sir, I'd really like to...

394
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,533
What?

395
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:50,433
Move this conversation along?

396
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,600
What if I just wanna
sit here and talk?

397
00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:57,933
For hours?

398
00:25:58,067 --> 00:26:01,167
What if we just talked
and talked, but then,

399
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,967
after all that, I decided

400
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,533
not to give you the response
you came in here looking for?

401
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:10,067
That would be frustrating,
wouldn't it?

402
00:26:11,067 --> 00:26:14,067
Sir, one of the main principles
I try to teach my students

403
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:18,500
who wanna be negotiators
is to never, ever start a clock

404
00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:20,733
because it gives the person
on the other end

405
00:26:20,867 --> 00:26:22,800
the opportunity to make
the wrong decision.

406
00:26:22,933 --> 00:26:25,600
We're not
in a classroom here, Gary.

407
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:27,800
And the principles
that you apply

408
00:26:27,933 --> 00:26:31,567
to hypothetical
situations, well...

409
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,667
they don't always work.

410
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,067
We're at an impasse here.

411
00:26:36,133 --> 00:26:40,967
And your "trickleflowgush"
theory... albeit a good one...

412
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:45,200
Well... that doesn't
seem to be working either.

413
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:47,200
So, what's your plan, then?

414
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:49,367
It's time to apply pressure.

415
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,467
Decker wants to start implementing
psyops to get them out.

416
00:26:54,733 --> 00:26:56,367
You wanna psychologically
torture them?

417
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,100
It's not torture.

418
00:26:58,233 --> 00:27:00,267
It's a safe way to push them.

419
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,743
This is not an FBisanctioned strategy.
You do understand that, right?

420
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:04,800
Don't think
I haven't thought this through.

421
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,767
I'm in a difficult
position here, Gary.

422
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,700
All right, so, you know...

423
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:12,909
just for shits and giggles,
let me get this straight.

424
00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:17,667
You wanna take a guy that we're fairly
certain is unstable to begin with...

425
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:21,600
and you're gonna attempt
to drive him crazy

426
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:24,300
with psychological pressure,

427
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:26,800
in hopes that somehow

428
00:27:26,933 --> 00:27:29,967
that will suddenly
make him more reasonable?

429
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:36,067
You've been requesting an open flow
of communication since you got here.

430
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:40,233
I just gave it to ya.

431
00:27:46,267 --> 00:27:47,900
My commander, David,
I spoke to him.

432
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:50,167
He's not gonna back down
on this ultimatum.

433
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,867
Yeah, well, we're not
backing down either, Gary.

434
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,067
David, I'm gonna try
something here.

435
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,067
I wanna talk to ya

436
00:27:59,133 --> 00:28:02,267
not like "Gary,
the FBI agent," but...

437
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,233
like I was your friend.

438
00:28:04,367 --> 00:28:07,333
And I want you to listen
to what I'm gonna say.

439
00:28:08,267 --> 00:28:11,600
As if a friend
was saying it to you.

440
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,600
Come out.

441
00:28:16,367 --> 00:28:19,067
Just come out
before it gets any worse.

442
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,433
That's my friendly advice.

443
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:26,100
I appreciate that, Gary.

444
00:28:26,233 --> 00:28:29,100
And I want this to be over
just as much as you do.

445
00:28:29,233 --> 00:28:31,600
You think I like
being in this place like this?

446
00:28:31,733 --> 00:28:33,767
I don't. It's awful.

447
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,433
You have no idea what I'd give
to have a hot shower right now.

448
00:28:37,567 --> 00:28:39,667
It can be over, David.

449
00:28:40,433 --> 00:28:43,633
You have the ability
to make it be over.

450
00:28:43,767 --> 00:28:45,867
I'm trying.

451
00:28:46,067 --> 00:28:48,433
I'm trying to connect with God.

452
00:28:48,567 --> 00:28:51,167
And I'm not just giving you
the runaround either, Gary.

453
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,833
I know.

454
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:59,300
Well, I just want you to know,
whatever happens from here on out...

455
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:01,733
I'm trying, too.

456
00:29:03,267 --> 00:29:04,833
I know you are.

457
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:07,267
I know.

458
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,200
Okay, yeah.

459
00:29:23,067 --> 00:29:24,600
All right. It's almost bedtime.

460
00:29:24,733 --> 00:29:26,800
But before you go,
I have something for you.

461
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,600
What is it?

462
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:30,533
Happy birthday.

463
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:33,700
Go ahead, make a wish,
and blow it out.

464
00:29:35,267 --> 00:29:36,533
What's going on here?

465
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,400
We're just having
a little party.

466
00:29:39,533 --> 00:29:40,633
Because it's my birthday.

467
00:29:40,767 --> 00:29:43,667
I know it is.

468
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,133
It's time to go to bed,
all right?

469
00:29:45,267 --> 00:29:47,067
Wait. She has to open
her present first.

470
00:29:50,767 --> 00:29:53,833
Wow. It's so pretty.

471
00:29:53,967 --> 00:29:56,067
- What is it?
- It's a drum key.

472
00:29:56,867 --> 00:29:58,243
If you're gonna be
a rock star someday,

473
00:29:58,267 --> 00:30:00,667
gotta know how to tune
a drum, right?

474
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,900
You like it?

475
00:30:04,033 --> 00:30:05,400
- Yeah.
- What do you say?

476
00:30:05,533 --> 00:30:08,667
- Thank you, Thibodeau.
- Aw, you're welcome.

477
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:13,100
What's happening?

478
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:19,833
Light 'em up, boys.

479
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,167
It's okay. It's okay.

480
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,333
It's okay.

481
00:31:57,267 --> 00:31:59,733
No, no, I'm sorry. Please
don't put words in my mouth.

482
00:31:59,867 --> 00:32:02,967
The FBI has no comment
at this time. Next question.

483
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,500
Is there a consideration
to use psychological warfare?

484
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:07,067
Have you discussed it at all?

485
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:09,067
I don't even know
what psychological warfare is.

486
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:11,267
Well, it was reported
that you're playing loud music

487
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,667
and shining bright lights
on the compound all night

488
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,333
to try to agitate the group.

489
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:17,900
Yeah, I cannot discuss tactics
of that sort, but I'd say

490
00:32:18,067 --> 00:32:20,509
there's minimal chance that we would
get up to that sort of activity.

491
00:32:20,533 --> 00:32:23,043
When are you gonna allow the parents
to intervene and talk to our children?

492
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:25,667
Well, that is not something we're
comfortable doing at the moment.

493
00:32:25,733 --> 00:32:28,733
Why? Why? How can it hurt
for our voices to get in there?

494
00:32:28,867 --> 00:32:32,533
We know our children. We should
be speaking to our children.

495
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:34,967
- Ma'am, there's a protocol...
- Screw your protocol!

496
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,533
I want to talk to my son!

497
00:32:37,667 --> 00:32:38,833
- Ma'am...
- Everybody here,

498
00:32:38,967 --> 00:32:40,733
all of these families here,

499
00:32:40,867 --> 00:32:42,227
we don't wanna
just stand around...

500
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:44,467
- Is there security?
- And just figure out

501
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,280
that we've waited too long?
I don't want...

502
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,333
- a dead son on my hands!
- Security, please!

503
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,533
Let me talk to my son!
Let us talk to our children!

504
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:54,900
I think that's going to
do it for today. Thank you.

505
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:09,167
I filled a bunch of glasses. I figured
I'd bring one over for Serenity.

506
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,800
Thank you.

507
00:33:11,933 --> 00:33:13,300
You're welcome.

508
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:18,167
How you guys doing?

509
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,333
It's freezing.

510
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:22,800
I have an extra blanket.
I'll run and grab it.

511
00:33:22,933 --> 00:33:24,267
Wait, Thibs.

512
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,733
You're the best.

513
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,067
Be right back.

514
00:33:48,967 --> 00:33:51,067
Wayne?

515
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:53,100
Get that generator working yet?

516
00:33:53,967 --> 00:33:55,967
Looks like it's gonna be
another cold one tonight.

517
00:33:56,733 --> 00:33:59,833
I've taken it apart and
put it back together twice.

518
00:34:00,067 --> 00:34:02,100
I still can't figure out
what's wrong with it.

519
00:34:02,233 --> 00:34:03,767
Do you mind if I have a look?

520
00:34:04,533 --> 00:34:06,200
I'll take all the help
I can get.

521
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:19,900
Come on in.

522
00:34:25,767 --> 00:34:28,167
How you doing?

523
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,067
Good.

524
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,100
I was just checking in on you,
see if you're okay.

525
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,200
What's wrong?

526
00:34:38,967 --> 00:34:40,867
Um...

527
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,133
I don't wanna die
in here, David.

528
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:50,067
I know I might.

529
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:54,067
Andand maybe
that's God's will, but...

530
00:34:55,067 --> 00:34:57,067
I don't want to.

531
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:01,400
I wish I had three more years
with you.

532
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:04,100
Three more years
to teach you the message.

533
00:35:04,233 --> 00:35:05,967
Who's to say you won't?

534
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,933
The way things are going,
I think it's clear.

535
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:11,067
We're going home.

536
00:35:11,133 --> 00:35:13,267
One way or another, Thibs.

537
00:35:19,267 --> 00:35:20,867
Michelle and Serenity...

538
00:35:23,433 --> 00:35:25,233
What about 'em?

539
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:29,567
If I decide to go...

540
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:32,433
will you let them leave with me?

541
00:35:43,067 --> 00:35:45,267
Your mother.

542
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,400
She sure struck a nerve
with you, didn't she?

543
00:35:49,767 --> 00:35:52,067
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

544
00:35:53,433 --> 00:35:55,533
They have a way of doing that.

545
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,800
And it would pain me,

546
00:36:02,933 --> 00:36:06,467
but I would not hold it against
you if you wanted to go join her.

547
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:10,967
But Michelle?

548
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:13,233
And Serenity?

549
00:36:16,433 --> 00:36:20,467
That is my wife...
and my daughter.

550
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:27,300
They are mine... to protect.

551
00:36:28,567 --> 00:36:30,467
Not yours.

552
00:36:33,267 --> 00:36:35,333
You understand?

553
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,633
Sources
near the scene are reporting

554
00:36:57,767 --> 00:37:00,367
that the FBI's main concern
right now is a mass suicide.

555
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:04,067
Authorities feel Koresh has become
unstable in the last few days

556
00:37:04,133 --> 00:37:06,300
and they worry
about what he might do.

557
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:07,800
A lightning storm...

558
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,933
I ran outta money for gas.
My car is freezing.

559
00:37:26,067 --> 00:37:29,800
- May I come in?
- Yes. Please.

560
00:37:34,867 --> 00:37:36,267
All right, Thibs.

561
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,467
I'm ready when you are.

562
00:37:42,133 --> 00:37:44,400
Hi, Mom. It's me.

563
00:37:45,233 --> 00:37:47,433
I saw you on the news
the other night.

564
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,533
I know this is hard on you.
I'm sorry.

565
00:37:54,533 --> 00:37:56,500
I just want you to know
I'm okay.

566
00:37:58,267 --> 00:38:00,567
I'm not being held
against my will.

567
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,833
I can come out whenever I want.
But...

568
00:38:05,967 --> 00:38:10,633
this is something I... I
thought about a lot, and...

569
00:38:12,133 --> 00:38:14,367
I need to see this through.

570
00:38:15,567 --> 00:38:17,733
'Cause people here...

571
00:38:17,867 --> 00:38:19,633
they're counting on me.

572
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,700
I can't leave them behind, so...

573
00:38:28,267 --> 00:38:30,367
I hope you understand.

574
00:38:32,467 --> 00:38:34,500
I really love you, Mom.

575
00:38:36,067 --> 00:38:37,500
I hope...

576
00:38:38,267 --> 00:38:40,200
Hope to see you soon.

577
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,167
- Hey, help me hang this blanket.
- Yeah.

578
00:39:00,067 --> 00:39:02,133
Can you get that side?

579
00:39:02,267 --> 00:39:05,167
Hang this up.

580
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,233
What's it gonna take to get you
to start seeing them as people?

581
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:14,167
I see 'em as people.

582
00:40:15,567 --> 00:40:17,533
Just not the kind
I ever wanna be around again.

583
00:40:21,467 --> 00:40:24,900
Have you noticed... that not
a single person has come out

584
00:40:25,033 --> 00:40:28,067
since you started screwing around
with them? What does that tell ya?

585
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,300
I don't know.

586
00:40:30,433 --> 00:40:32,533
That they're a bunch
of stubborn sons of bitches?

587
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:40,233
History's not gonna be on your
side with this one, Mitch.

588
00:40:43,533 --> 00:40:45,367
I'll take the other side
of that bet.

589
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,000
Just stand down, okay?
For a few days.

590
00:40:48,133 --> 00:40:52,267
Turn the power back on.
And give them...

591
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,033
a moment to start
thinking straight again.

592
00:40:55,167 --> 00:40:57,267
That's not my call.
Talk to Prince.

593
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,233
Prince isn't listening to me
anymore, Mitch.

594
00:41:01,367 --> 00:41:03,800
He's listening to you.

595
00:41:10,767 --> 00:41:12,267
Five thousand to one.

596
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,833
Those are the odds against us.

597
00:41:14,967 --> 00:41:18,467
Five thousand people
to every one officer of the law.

598
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,767
You know how we keep order
with those odds?

599
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:27,300
Because they believe
we're more powerful than we are.

600
00:41:27,433 --> 00:41:29,100
We project strength.

601
00:41:29,233 --> 00:41:31,733
And the people believe
in that strength.

602
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,667
So when we sit outside
a place like this,

603
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,467
for weeks on end,

604
00:41:42,267 --> 00:41:44,567
waiting for them to tire...

605
00:41:45,767 --> 00:41:49,100
we look weak in front of the
rest of the whole world.

606
00:41:49,233 --> 00:41:53,800
And every angry asshole with a
bomb kit starts getting ideas.

607
00:41:54,667 --> 00:41:57,567
This is more
than a situation now, Gary.

608
00:41:59,133 --> 00:42:00,667
This is a symbol.

609
00:42:03,567 --> 00:42:07,367
Are we the kind of agency
that coddles cop killers?

610
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,400
Or are we the goddamn FBI?

611
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:30,600
Come on.

612
00:42:31,367 --> 00:42:34,200
Whoo!

613
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:36,700
Yeah!

614
00:42:41,067 --> 00:42:42,900
You did it!

615
00:42:43,067 --> 00:42:45,633
I knew you would! Great job!

616
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,400
How much gas do we have
in there?

617
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:51,733
10 minutes, tops.

618
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:55,433
I know what I wanna do with it.

619
00:43:08,167 --> 00:43:10,300
My God.

620
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,300
Hello?

621
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,467
- Hi, sis.
- My God, Steve!

622
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,300
Where are you?
Did you get out of there?

623
00:43:48,433 --> 00:43:50,600
No, I'm still inside.

624
00:43:51,367 --> 00:43:53,700
I found a phone. And...

625
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:56,300
- Steve?
- You know what? I...

626
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:59,267
Look, Sue,
I don't have a lot of time.

627
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,600
This thing's beeping at me,
but... listen.

628
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:07,900
I... there's been a lot of talk
on the news

629
00:44:08,067 --> 00:44:12,067
and, um, with the FBI, about
us committing suicide in here.

630
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,433
And I just want you to know,
no matter what they tell you,

631
00:44:15,567 --> 00:44:19,267
that we would never
kill ourselves.

632
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,667
And so,

633
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,900
if we somehow... I don't know...
If we wind up dead, or...

634
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:32,967
And... and that's what they're
telling people around the world,

635
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:36,300
then I just want you to know
that it's a lie.

636
00:44:38,067 --> 00:44:39,700
Okay?

637
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,167
Sue...?

638
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,800
Can you hear what I'm...

639
00:44:57,333 --> 00:45:00,533
What is that?

640
00:45:01,433 --> 00:45:03,600
What's that sound?

641
00:45:03,733 --> 00:45:05,300
Hey, turn off the speakers.

642
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:15,067
- I thought we cut the power off.
- We did.

643
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,700
If we were to go in...

644
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,267
What would that look like?

645
00:46:15,067 --> 00:46:17,900
I could have a plan
on your desk by morning.

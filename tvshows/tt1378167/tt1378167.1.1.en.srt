Stay with me,G. Don't
do this to me. Come on!

Fat free?

33
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,980
So...What is it this time,G?

34
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,760
Cold showers,bed bugs,feng shui?

35
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,610
Too noisy.

36
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,630
Last place was too quiet.

37
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,030
The place before that was too hot.

38
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,920
No,no,no. That place was too cold.

39
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,280
The place before that  was too hot.

40
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,200
You sure you're  ready to come back?

41
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,230
What,are you my mother or something?

42
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,800
You could use one.

43
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,610
Yeah.

44
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,630
I got you.

45
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,830
Thank you.

46
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,640
It's a new office,huh?

47
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,250
Yep. What's it like?

48
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,140
Noisy.

49
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,410
Three months and the neighbors
 still don't know we're here.

50
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,480
Hiding in plain sight.

51
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,320
What was it before we got it?

52
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,410
Old water plant administration building.

53
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,580
Condemned  after the Northridge quake.

54
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,120
Condemned?

55
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,270
Only on the outside,G.

56
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,070
Coming through!

57
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,850
By the end of the day.

58
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,370
Just put it on my desk.

59
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,340
Vi

60
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,730
Got to go see you know who.

61
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,560
Oh,Hetty,I gave you the receipts.

62
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,160
If every agent came back
from an undercover assignment

63
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,240
with expenses unaccounted for,Mr. Hanna,

64
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,930
I'd be either out of
a job or out of pocket.

65
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,090
I don't intend to be either.

66
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,590
What are we down to?   15,20 bucks?

67
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,220
$61.And a nickel.

68
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,560
You're a fantastic
operations manager,Hetty.

69
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,730
All right.I got you.

70
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,740
$20. Yeah.

71
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,230
$40. $60.

72
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,510
Okay? Thank you.

73
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,470
I'll spot you the nickel.

74
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,650
Thank you. I'm good for it.

75
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,730
Mr. Callen.

76
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,350
You're not due back for a month.

77
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,600
I missed your sunny smile,Hetty.

78
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,860
We need to update your biometrics.

79
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,060
New photos for drivers
licenses,passports,

80
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,450
general backstopping...  Not to speak of

81
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,780
documents,credit cards   and
so forth,and,um... wardrobe.

82
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,090
Problems with the neighbors?

83
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,440
Something like that.

84
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,890
Well,don't even thinkabout unrolling

85
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,030
that  disgusting thing in here.

86
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,520
I think she's mellowed.

87
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,750
I think I'm in love.

88
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,800
Who's that?

89
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,840
It's a new guy,started this week.

90
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,850
Green.

91
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,960
That's his name?

92
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,180
Nope.

93
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,210
Heads up!

94
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,840
Director's coming online.

95
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,270
Hey,Callen.
  ---Eric.

96
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,390
Well,it's about time.

97
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,830
Kensi.

98
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,020
Hello.My favorite agent.

99
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,220
Oh,I thought you'd callously
abandoned us to join the FBI.

100
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,750
Uh,once was enough.

101
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,960
You still making the weekend
 drive up to Pendleton?

102
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,020
Of course.  Home away from home.

103
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,730
Well,that's what you get
for growing up a Marine brat.

104
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,630
Yeah,yeah.

105
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,070
Get a note from your doctor?

106
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,490
You're my doctor,Nate.

107
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,600
Yeah,I just get to play around
 inside your head,though.

108
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,820
How's the rest of you?
Aches? Pains? Insomnia?

109
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,880
Yeah,all of that.

110
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,350
Before I was shot.

111
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,050
Hi. Dominic. Callen.

112
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,020
Nice to meet you,Dom.

113
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,050
Is Callen his
first-- Just Callen.

114
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,810
Just Callen. I got it.

115
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,620
Agent Callen.

116
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,330
I didn't think you were due back
from sick leave till next month.

117
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,640
I guess you didn't get the email.

118
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,270
I guess you haven't sent it yet.

119
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,130
Your case is still active,Callen.

120
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,630
We will find them.

121
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,850
Yes,sir.

122
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,550
We will.

123
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,640
Here's the reason I'm calling.

124
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,230
It's Commander Frank McGuire.

125
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,220
Works for the office 
of Naval Intelligence.

126
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,850
Or did,until  two hours ago.

127
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,280
He was kidnapped and subsequently killed

128
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,060
in a shootout with LAPD.

129
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,530
Routine traffic stop,

130
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,170
his kidnappers sped
off,LAPD went after them.

131
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,950
McGuire got caught in the crossfire.

132
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,360
What do we know  about the kidnappers?

133
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,550
Mexican Nationals.

134
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,200
That's what's got us worried.

135
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,210
In less than 12 hours,there's going
to be a coordinated military operation

136
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,270
on both sides of the Mexican
border against the drug cartels.

137
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,750
Operation Dakota.

138
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,440
McGuire had detailed
knowledge of this plan.

139
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,560
We need to find out if
it's been compromised.

140
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,010
Files' on its way,Eric.

141
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,680
Keep me in the loop.

142
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,760
Footage,Eric.

143
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,640
Eric,slide it back.

144
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,010
Hold it.

145
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,820
Dom?

146
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,310
What do you see?

147
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,840
Um,the second guy's been hit

148
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,220
and he's trying  to get back in the SUV.

149
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,830
Okay. Why?   
---- Uh... Cover?

150
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,010
Zoom and enhance,Eric.

151
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,250
Passenger side window  just exploded.

152
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,700
Yeah,but that's not a surprise.

153
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,190
Lots of incoming from the LAPD.

154
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,510
Tighter,Eric.

155
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,460
Advance three frames.

156
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,690
The window's blowing
 into the car,not out.

157
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,760
Kidnapper fired the shot.

158
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,270
McGuire wasn't killed in the crossfire.

159
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,360
He was executed.

160
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,360
Okay,so you're a bad guy.

161
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,090
Yore surrounded by LAPD.

162
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,660
You've seen the movies. You're
going to shoot your way out.

163
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,300
Only your buddy takes one in the chest

164
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,720
and he's dead before he hits the ground.

165
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,330
I think I've seen that movie.

166
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,620
Now the cops are
blamming away. Blam. Blam.

167
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,320
Six cops,squeezing Glocks.

168
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,310
That's a lead storm
that's coming right at you.

169
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,990
Definitely ain't no movie.

170
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,410
What do you do?

171
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,770
Al Pacino was in it.

172
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,260
Might have been Deniro.

173
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,610
You pee your pants.

174
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,370
You drop your weapon,you
kiss the pavement.

175
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,810
Okay?

176
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,230
At least that's  what I'd do.

177
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,150
Instead,I go back to the
 car,execute the hostage,

178
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,520
and die doing it.

179
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,480
Now,why would you sacrifice 
yourself to kill your hostage?

180
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,120
So he couldn't reveal
what you were up to?

181
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,990
McGuire lives at 1041,apartment one.

182
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,070
What are we?

183
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,650
If anyone asks?

184
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,350
We're city inspectors.

185
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,700
No. Nobody talks  to city inspectors.

186
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,500
Okay,you're a realtor.  I'm your client.

187
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,480
You're showing me an apartment.
Do I look like a realtor?

188
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,150
Okay,I'm the realtor.

189
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,450
You're the guy looking
for the apartment. Okay?

190
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,620
Can we go?

191
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,470
Would I live in a  place like this?

192
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,540
I mean,I don't even know if I
could afford a place like this.

193
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,090
Well,that's why I'm showing you.

194
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,500
To see if,

195
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,430
you know,you would want to
 live in a place like this.

196
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,840
Does it have a Jacuzzi?

197
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,330
If it has,I'm going  to drown you in it.

198
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,870
Hi. This is Frank McGuire.

199
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,760
Sorry I can't take your call right now.

200
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,240
Leave a message and I'll
get right back with you.

201
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,830
Clear.Clear.

202
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,280
Message bank deleted.

203
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,020
Looks like someone didn't want
 us to hear McGuire's messages.

204
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,250
Eric?

205
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,070
I need you to check a call.

206
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,170
I'll run a check on McGuire's
 phone log,see what we turn up.

207
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:25,120
Okay,McGuire graduated top 1%
from the Naval Academy. Wow.

208
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,850
Look at this. Stellar career.

209
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,580
Specialized in satellite image analysis

210
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,430
and spent time in the
San Nicolas Navy Base.

211
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,230
Where is that?

212
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,230
75 miles off  the coast of L.A.

213
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,530
It was discovered by Spanish 
  explorer Sebastian Vizcaino.

214
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,370
He actually charted  the
entire California coast.

215
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,160
And his ship was called the San Diego,

216
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,940
which is where the bay gets
        its name,of course.

217
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,400
I think it was back in...1602?

218
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,460
I read a lot.

219
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,560
Reading's good.

220
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,890
Found this on the coffee table.

221
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,240
Like it mattered.

222
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:13,380
"Emma Fleet Week San Diego."

223
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,940
McGuire wasn't married.

224
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,070
His birthday was two months ago.

225
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,670
How long do you leave
birthday cards on display?

226
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,860
I don't know.  I never got one.

227
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,800
You've never gotten a
single birthday card?

228
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:26,600
Nope.

229
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,230
What? It's not a big deal.

230
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,960
I'm definitely getting you
 a birthday card this year.

231
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,520
Great. You make sure  
you put some money in it.

232
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,100
How about I put a   personality in it?

233
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:44,610
"Happy birthday to my
favorite uncle.Love Emma."

234
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,240
Mystery solved.Mystery solved.

235
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,360
No signs of struggle.

236
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,690
Dead bolts on all the windows and doors.

237
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,500
Must have snatched  him off the street.

238
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,410
Laptop's encrypted.

239
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,940
It's a job for Eric.

240
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,470
You know,for a career navy guy,

241
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,280
Commander McGuire wasn't
 very squared away.

242
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,480
Unless he had something
else  on his mind.

243
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,840
No Jacuzzi.

244
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,590
Deal breaker?

245
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,800
Afraid so.

246
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,070
Aw,there goes my commission.

247
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,580
Gardner included in the lease?

248
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,610
EXCUSE ME...

249
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,480
Do you speak English ?

250
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,160
I'm looking for an apartment...

251
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,230
but i don't trust the realtor.

252
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,180
He's kinda shady.

253
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,220
Devious.

254
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,370
Is this a safe area?

255
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,660
It is.

256
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:53,940
Very safe.

257
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,140
This-this navy guy-- I
looked  at his apartment,and--

258
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,970
he was kidnapped,murdered.

259
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,670
Did you know him?

260
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,910
Oh,every day he waves.

261
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,190
I saw him this morning.

262
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,420
He's dead?

263
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,720
And already his apartment's available.

264
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,370
Unbelievable.

265
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,780
Hey,you might have been the
last person to see him alive.

266
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,280
No,he was with his friends.

267
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,420
Well,what if they were the
ones that kidnapped him?

268
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,200
No,no,no,they   were his friends.

269
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,500
They've been here before.

270
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,620
I see their car--
the blue Tahoe.

271
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,470
Blue Tahoe?Yeah.

272
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,680
When?    ----Every
day this week.

273
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,530
Did you get the plates?

274
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,570
He was clean.

275
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:11,540
Turns out it wasn't McGuire's
first trip in the Tahoe.

276
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,110
He knew them. They picked him
 up every morning this week,

277
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,140
dropped him off three hours later.

278
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,900
Sound like a kidnapping to you,Sam?

279
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,650
It looks like a kidnapping,but it's not.

280
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,920
So why the hood and the nylon ties?

281
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,940
They don't want him to see
where they're taking him,

282
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,700
so they tie his hands so he's not
tempted to lift the hood and peek.

283
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,440
It's common practice in the Middle East.

284
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,800
I've used the technique
 a few times myself.

285
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,970
Now,McGuire used to get
to the office around 8:30

286
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,640
give or take five or ten minutes.

287
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,410
But,as you can see,he was
late every day this week.

288
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,400
The gardener said they
 picked him up at 7:30.

289
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,470
And three hours later
they drop him back at home

290
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,730
and then he goes to work.

291
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,090
A lot you can do in three hours.

292
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,630
Yeah,especially if you have 
top-secret security clearance.

293
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,920
How much time do we have,Eric?

294
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,710
Uh,Operation Dakota 
against the drug cartels

295
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,000
kicks off in seven hours and 33 minutes.

296
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,700
What about the call
to McGuire's apartment

297
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,790
to erase his voice mail?
I'm still working on it.

298
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,760
Finances?  Nothing out of the ordinary.

299
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,040
Travel?  Nothing in his name or
any of his known credit cards.

300
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,320
Family,relatives?

301
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,750
Parents are deceased.

302
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,940
He's got one
sister--Helen McGuire.

303
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,200
Lives in West Hollywood.

304
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,680
Divorced,one kid.

305
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,060
A girl...mma.

306
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,170
Photo at the apartment.
 Her favorite uncle.

307
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,620
All right,enough with
the look already.I'll go .

308
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:43,020
And I will take our trained
expertoperational psychologist  for backup.

309
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,000
I love field work.

310
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,250
Do I get to carry a gun?

311
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,370
Yeah,no,I don't think we're
expecting a lot of trouble

312
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,860
from a grieving family,Nate.

313
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,750
Can I still carry a gun?

314
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,670
Wear one of those  ankle holsters?

315
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,290
Maybe that would  make me walk funny.

316
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,700
You already walk  funny,Nate.

317
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,920
Where are we with  friends or lovers?

318
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,620
There's one
stand out-- a guy.

319
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:01,620
Friend or lover?

320
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,030
Not really the question 
that had jumped out at me.

321
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,720
Informed guess.

322
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:09,970
e's a six-foot,three200 pound
special forces paratrooper,guys.

323
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,450
I'm leaning towards a friend.

324
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,430
Good call,Dom.

325
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,070
Got a hit on that phone number.

326
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,180
Detail's coming up.

327
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,640
Same phone number used to call in

328
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:18,770
and erase McGuire's voice mail,

329
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,250
also called him 15 times
in the last four days.

330
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,260
Somebody's trying to cover their tracks.

331
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,240
Distance themselves
from the investigation.

332
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,680
Who is he?

333
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,160
Who made those calls? That's him.

334
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,580
The special forces  paratrooper guy.

335
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,130
He runs a private security firm.

336
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,320
Bobby J. Jenlow & Associates.

337
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:37,860
What do the  associates do?

338
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,450
Anything Bobby J. Jenlow  tells them to.

339
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,830
No plates.

340
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,830
Small world.

341
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,370
Bobby J.Jenlow &Associates 1321

342
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,030
Are you listening  to me,Eddie?

343
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,300
No,no!

344
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,270
You listen to me.

345
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,750
It's called  standing up,okay?

346
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,680
It's called standing
up  for your brothers.

347
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,290
That's all I'm ask...

348
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,220
- Just do it--
for me,Eddie.

349
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,370
Just do it.

350
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,870
You run pretty good.

351
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,500
Nice hand brake turn.

352
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:13,700
You gonna badge me?

353
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,460
Make a difference if we do?

354
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,150
Saw you going in.

355
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:17,990
I didn't know who you were.

356
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,620
So you cleared  the phones remotely.

357
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,330
Private conversations.

358
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,490
Every one.

359
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,740
Close?

360
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,480
Since we were kids.

361
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,110
It's got to hurt knowing one of your
close buddies is betraying his country.

362
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,020
He was kidnapped.

363
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,160
He was no traitor.

364
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,210
You guys don't know anything.

365
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:37,980
We know he wasn't kidnapped.

366
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,170
We know he's been  working with
them for the better part of a week.

367
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,370
We know he was shot  to shut him up.

368
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,530
What do you know,Bobby?

369
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,370
Nothing.

370
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,950
You're special ops.

371
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,730
It's funny how we all
 know just by looking.

372
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,370
Me,I was a SEAL.

373
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,960
Planning a little hunting party,Bobby?

374
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,600
We're done.

375
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,850
Jenlow compromised the
operation against the cartels.

376
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,770
Putting together a
team to go after them.

377
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,820
Retribution.

378
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,300
How long do we have?

379
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,420
Not long.

380
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,670
I sent everyone home.

381
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,950
All my friends.

382
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,870
I wanted to be alone.

383
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,450
When did you last see your brother?

384
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,100
Thank you. The weekend.

385
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,210
Frank,took,uh,

386
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,970
He was always taking her  someplace.

387
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,890
The beach,the movies.

388
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,110
After we divorced,

389
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,500
Emma's father Luis,moved overseas.

390
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:56,270
So Frank became the man in her life.

391
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,270
Did you speak to your brother
at all on the phone this week?

392
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,240
No.

393
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,450
Did he mention he was
worried about something?

394
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,710
Nothing.

395
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,510
Everything  was normal.

396
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,480
And then...

397
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,220
Will you excuse me?

398
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,630
Sure.

399
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,950
You know,you can tell a lot
about people from their fridge?

400
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,430
And not just what's on the inside.

401
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,150
Outside tells a story,too.

402
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,710
She's grieving.

403
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,570
Yes,she is.

404
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:29,440
Which is normal considering
the circumstances.

405
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,350
Absolutely.

406
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,460
So what?

407
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,560
Tell me.

408
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,550
She's on edge.

409
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,220
Answering way  too quickly.

410
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,470
Particularly to direct questions
requiring a simple yes or no.

411
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,880
And mostly she's saying no.

412
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,300
Kensi--

413
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,640
everything that woman
just told us was a lie.

414
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,180
Mr. Callen.A moment?

415
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,460
You want some backup?

416
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:20,270
Your hand.Eye.Car.

417
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,420
Blue '07 Impala.

418
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,220
Modified the engine,

419
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,220
upgraded the
brakes,transmission,suspension

420
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,960
Mr. Callen.A moment?

421
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,050
You want some backup?

422
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:10,410
Your hand.

423
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,320
Eye.

424
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,060
Car.
- Blue '07 Impala.

425
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,620
Modified the engine,

426
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,440
upgraded the brakes,transmission,

427
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,410
suspension.Fitted with 19-inch wheels.

428
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:32,150
And latest smart technology.

429
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:37,510
Three-G network with two four
megapixel  cameras,updated microphone,

430
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,270
32 gig flash drive,

431
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:44,000
Wi-Fi,Bluetooth,mini-USB
slot and of course,GPS.

432
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,680
And it's encrypted.

433
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,940
And so please don't
forget your pin this time.

434
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,020
Let's go.

435
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,750
Now wardrobe for your undercover work.

436
00:21:53,800 --> 00:22:00,020
I know you grew up in the well-meaning but
cold embrace of the welfare state,Mr. Callen.

437
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,560
But just because you're an orphan,

438
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,680
doesn't mean that you have
to dress like Oliver Twist.

439
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,820
Now,we need something

440
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,250
modern,individual...

441
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,320
that speaks to the man within.

442
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,590
That's not for you to admire.

443
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,630
It's for you to try on.

444
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:27,810
Here.And here.And here.

445
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,230
This or this?

446
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,730
Those.

447
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,160
A fitted boot jean,medium weight,

448
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,480
distressed denim.

449
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:38,840
I think we need something
 more relaxed,Mr. Callen.

450
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,110
Something amuses you?

451
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,700
Oh,it's just that in three
years,you've never called me G.

452
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,530
Well,it's not a name.

453
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,580
It's a letter.

454
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:03,410
Now if you were to tell me
what the "G" stands for...

455
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,980
No one ever told me.

456
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,640
Tell me that's good news,Eric.

457
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:20,850
Uh,that's good news.And that
is Commander McGuire's laptop.

458
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,440
- You got in?
- I got in.

459
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,570
Well,me and about a hundred
-   thousand other Zombie computers.

460
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:29,830
I hacked into an illegal botnet  system and redirected
the computing power into  cracking the encryption.

461
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:34,530
Couple of minutes,and we'll get  to peek
inside all of McGuire's  dirty little secrets.

462
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,040
All right,guys,

463
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:39,870
Nate thinks  McGuire's sister's lying to us;
that she knew what   her brother was doing.

464
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,600
But I think there's something else.

465
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:46,580
It's like the kind  of raw emotion that you see
in someone when the nightmare's still unfolding.

466
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,520
It's like it was still happening to her.

467
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,160
Same time every morning,

468
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,330
they pick him up,cover his
face and take him somewhere.

469
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,840
So why would someone
betray their country?

470
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,350
Ideology,

471
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,830
greed.

472
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,760
Love.

473
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,870
Oh,my God,it's her.

474
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,020
- McGuire's sister?
- No,his niece.

475
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,200
Eric,Buddiesbook entry for
Emma McGuire,West Hollywood!

476
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,660
Coming in five.

477
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,720
She said she wanted to be alone.

478
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,940
Callen,her daughter
wasn't even with her.

479
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,600
All right,here we go.

480
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,360
Emma's been sending messages
to her friends every single day.

481
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,790
And then come this week...

482
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,070
No messages.

483
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,700
Nothing. She hasn't 
logged on for four days.

484
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,690
So,whatever they've  been getting McGuire to
do,this is how they've been  forcing him to do it.

485
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,770
This is why she's still living it.

486
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,720
It's still happening.

487
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,070
They have her daughter.

488
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,980
Coming in three,two,one.Bingo.

489
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,240
We just opened   four encrypted emails

490
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,940
sent to McGuire's laptop
  over the last four days.

491
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:58,280
Sequential time code is within
 an hour of the download.

492
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,960
They were dialing direct from
one of our own defense satellites.

493
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,130
McGuire downlinks the satellite
images to the main computer,

494
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,580
and then secretly e-mails
them  to his own laptop.

495
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,190
Recording everything they
were  making him steal.

496
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,800
There's the San Diego Bay.

497
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,940
army bases,border crossing.

498
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,470
border security.

499
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:17,050
- Eric,get me Vance.
- Got it.

500
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,820
How did the drug  cartels find out
McGuire even had satellite access?

501
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,520
It was a joint military   operation,

502
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,250
so the leak probably came
 from south of the border.

503
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,810
Cartel sets up a satellite uplink,

504
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,630
kidnaps his niece
Emma,who's still missing.

505
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,110
knowing that he'll do anything
 they ask and not tell anyone.

506
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,410
He did tell someone.

507
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,840
Bobby Jenlow.  He's
gonna try to rescue her.

508
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,240
Probably gave McGuire a GPS locator.

509
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,810
- Gotta find Jenlow,Eric.
- I'm already on it.

510
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,840
And Director's online.

511
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,510
What do you got Callen?

512
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,260
Operation Dakota's been  compromised.

513
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,930
Mexican drug cartel  forced McGuire
to access one of our satellites.

514
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,630
- Forced?
- Kidnapped his niece.

515
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,730
She's still missing.

516
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,420
It's too late to stop Dakota.

517
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,050
Gotta find out which cartel.

518
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,980
We'll hit them first.

519
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:05,410
And you have  less than four hours.

520
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,910
And Callen...

521
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:09,400
the girl is a priority.

522
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,610
Jenlow's cell phone is on.

523
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,260
And I got him. Hollywood Hills.

524
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,630
Kensi,McGuire's sister.

525
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:31,270
- You know.
- We put the pieces together.

526
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,000
I'm sorry,Helen.

527
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,610
Come in.

528
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,290
I wanted to tell you,but
Bobby wouldn't let me.

529
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,520
He's going up there  to bring her back.

530
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,560
- When?
- Now.

531
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,590
Hey,Sam,it's me. I'm with Helen McGuire.

532
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,500
Bobby Jenlow's on his way in.

533
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,570
Copy that.  First turn
off Viewpoint Road. Got it.

534
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,420
All right,we're ten minutes out.

535
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,750
Transmitting.

536
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,040
Stand by.Picture's up.

537
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,480
He's gonna get another ticket.

538
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,710
- Have they contacted you?
- No.

539
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,290
Okay,well,if they do,I want you to keep talking
to them so that   we can trace the call,okay?

540
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,510
They were at the market.

541
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,150
One minute Emma was
standing  right next to him,

542
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,470
the next,Frank turned around
 and she was just gone.

543
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,770
How do they contact him?

544
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:23,100
Cell phone,couple of minutes
after she disappeared.

545
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,480
They told him  what they
wanted him to do.  He agreed.

546
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,230
Have they let you speak to her?

547
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,120
No.

548
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,920
Bobby got Frank  a GPS transmitter.

549
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,280
Frank put it in  the cartel's house.

550
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,430
He gave up his life for my daughter.

551
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,180
Turn's up ahead,Sam.

552
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,620
You feeling lucky?

553
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,440
After last time?

554
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,350
Not particularly.

555
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,870
Here we go.

556
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,550
That's not Jenlow.

557
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:12,900
Look out!

558
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,140
Callen.

559
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,820
It's okay,Bobby.

560
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,610
Emma. Get Emma.

561
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,980
Eric,ambulance.

562
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,650
Sam and I are fine.

563
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,240
She's not here.

564
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,870
Find her.

565
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:55,180
Please,just,just find her.

566
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,130
Any ID on  our two amigos?

567
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,910
All cashed up,no ID.

568
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,430
The car had a GPS
system  tracking system.

569
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,340
Previous destinations.

570
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,760
There's only two  with repeat
journeys.This one and one   in Malibu.

571
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:19,040
Hey,Eric.Yeah,give me everything  you
got on 1727 Pacific Coast Highway,Malibu.

572
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,770
Okay. House is owned by PPZ Investments.

573
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:28,860
It's a trust,which in turn is
owned by a guy named Manny Cortez.

574
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,340
"Mad" Manny Cortez?

575
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,750
Uh,it doesn't describe him as "Mad"
in the SEC filing,but if you say so.

576
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,830
We found our cartel.

577
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,440
Who's Manny Cortez?

578
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,790
Just a mass-murdering drug lord
with a classic  Oedipus complex.

579
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:46,000
Last bit's an educated guess.I'd
have to talk to him  to be certain.

580
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,480
Manny and his father ran one of
the largest drug cartels in Mexico.

581
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:52,040
- And now it's just him.
- What happened to his father?

582
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,980
According to legend,Manny cut off
his toes with a pair of bolt cutters.

583
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:59,210
Then his fingers. Then
some other... bits.

584
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,380
Cool.

585
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:09,450
Helen,I'm sorry.

586
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,500
Emma wasn't at the house.

587
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,900
Bobby?

588
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:19,770
He's on his way  to the ER.Gunshot
wound,but I think e's going gonna be okay.

589
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:31,190
- Hello?
- It's Luis. Any news?

590
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,580
It's my ex. Emma's dad.

591
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,210
Hello,Luis.

592
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:40,120
- There's no news. Emma's still...
- Helen,what about Emma?

593
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:43,170
Please,you just need to
tell me    what's happening.

594
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,920
Luis,I...

595
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,880
Excuse me.

596
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,760
Could you?

597
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,570
- Mr. Perez?
- Who is this?

598
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:58,210
Special Agent Kensi Blye,NCIS.

599
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,300
Oh,geez.

600
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:04,620
Sir,I just have to reassure you  that we are doing
everything we can to get your little girl back.

601
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,310
Helen didn't tell me until this morning.

602
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,600
I'm booked on the next
flight out of London.

603
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,910
You promise me you'll do
everything to find her.

604
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:14,110
Everything,you hear me?

605
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:17,180
- Yes,sir,I hear you.
- Thank you.

606
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,180
Emma adores her father.

607
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:28,830
He only just gets back to
town couple of times a year.

608
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,590
We were planning on having
Thanksgiving together.

609
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,070
What do you think it'd
take  to storm that place?

610
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,190
A week's planning  and a small army.

611
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,120
Could be too late,G.

612
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:03,460
Nate,the girl,you
think she's still alive?

613
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,450
The moment McGuire  was killed,

614
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,320
she became a
liability.Now,psychologically,

615
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,130
the fact that she's a child
makes the decision harder,but...

616
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,060
eventually,self-interest
 usually wins through.

617
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,910
If she's still alive,she's
running out of time.

618
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,390
We need a plan.

619
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:27,000
Okay,we could send in  a tactical team.We'd
need at least an hour to get them togeth

620
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:30,660
- We don't have an hour.
-Okay,okay,uh,utility company,

621
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,030
city engineer... food delivery.

622
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:39,110
No,if Manny Cortez is really there,the only way    he's
gonna invite us in is if he thinks there's money in it.

623
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:44,160
"Trade ei id quod cupit."

624
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,160
hat was that,Greek?

625
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,750
Latin.

626
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,610
"Give them what they want."

627
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,310
Very good,Dominic.

628
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:53,240
Though your declension
needs a little work.

629
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:58,770
The pronoun is,uh,masculine
singular--"Give him what he wants."

630
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:03,720
So,what does this toe-cutter...  want?

631
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:08,840
Satellite access,24/7.

632
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,460
Did you make the call,Nate?

633
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,850
Yeah. He's expecting you.

634
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,400
Yeah? What do you want?

635
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,020
Want to do business.

636
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:24,100
What sort of business?

637
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,730
Satellite business.

638
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,820
Game time.

639
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,870
Okay,man.

640
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,160
I'm good.No problem.

641
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,510
- Who are you?
- Frank Hanley.

642
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,440
I'm a lawyer.

643
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,980
A lawyer needs a bodyguard?

644
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,500
Oh,the big guy.

645
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:23,280
Big guy's actually my client.

646
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,120
Works in the Defense Department.

647
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,020
Civilian analyst.

648
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:30,370
Actually,he just worked  with a
former business  partner of yours.

649
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:33,530
Naval commander...named McGuire?

650
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,050
Never heard of him.

651
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:38,290
Really?Well,maybe you've
 heard of his niece?

652
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,260
Her name is Emma.

653
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,520
McGuire shared some
information with my client.

654
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,470
In less than  three
hours,Operation Dakota begins.

655
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:04,370
In less than one hour,my
client can have you back online.

656
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,980
Real-time,satellite
imagery,the Mexican border.

657
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,850
24/7.

658
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,790
And how can your client do this?

659
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,710
It's a simple phone call.

660
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,630
Picture's coming up.

661
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,700
Guys,that's   not Manny Cortez.

662
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,630
Then who is it?

663
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,790
I don't believe you.

664
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:33,540
Daddy.Daddy!

665
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,500
Is that who I think it is?

666
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,310
Kensi.

667
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,990
Kensi,the father's behind this.

668
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,820
Emma's with him.

669
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:55,110
Nate,he called here.

670
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,030
He knows--
Luis knows

671
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:00,100
we're NCIS. Operation's
compromised.He knows.

672
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,270
Okay,we have to do something.

673
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:05,950
When can I call Mommy?

674
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,010
Tomorrow,I promise.

675
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,840
Now,Daddy's busy.

676
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:12,430
Why don't you go have your swim
and I'll join you soon,okay?

677
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:15,210
- Okay.- Give me
a kiss.Bye-bye.

678
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,150
We all live a lie.

679
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,100
Some a bigger lie than others.

680
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:29,450
I spoke to one of your 
colleagues on the phone.

681
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,990
A distraught father.

682
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,700
She was NCIS.

683
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:35,660
I assume you are,too?

684
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:38,090
How long you been working
  for Manny Cortez?

685
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,880
Seven,eight years.

686
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:43,240
A double life.

687
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:46,680
You were McGuire's
 brother-in-law.

688
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,410
He never thought I was
good enough for his sister.

689
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,560
Yeah,he was right.

690
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:54,190
You set him up to believe 
that his niece was kidnapped.

691
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,020
She was.

692
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,960
But by her father.

693
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,890
And she's not going back.

694
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,980
Yeah,he's right here.

695
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,080
It's McGuire.

696
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,010
He's not really dead.

697
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,870
Thanks,Dom.

698
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,640
You're welcome.

699
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,980
Kensi...

700
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,950
give her the phone.

701
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:15,090
Hello.

702
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,800
It's for you.

703
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:19,670
Hello.

704
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,390
Baby!Oh,baby...

705
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,610
Hi,Mommy.

706
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:28,960
When can I come home?I
want to come home.

707
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:31,870
You can come home  right now.

708
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,710
- I miss you.
- I miss you,too.

709
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:45,240
Sweetheart,I love  you so much.

710
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,980
I love you too,Mom.

711
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,870
Expense accounts.

712
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,630
You're six months behind.

713
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:04,450
I would have thought that seeing as you
had so much  time off for recuperation,

714
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:07,380
you would have caught
up  on your paperwork.

715
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,980
Please tell me you're kidding me,Hetty.

716
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:12,630
Well,I could,but it would be a lie.

717
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:15,110
No,rush.

718
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:18,290
Tomorrow will be fine.

719
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,100
- Night.
- Night,Dom,

720
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,610
Kensi,Nate.

721
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:48,020
Sofa's free at my place.

722
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,120
Noisy.

723
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,600
- Okay.Good night,G.
- Good night.

724
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,140
***

725
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,690
And... done.

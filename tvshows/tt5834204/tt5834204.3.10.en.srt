<i>Previously on
The Handmaid's Tale...</i>

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,683
Aunt Lydia, may I go home, please?

3
00:00:05,684 --> 00:00:09,619
You may go home when your
walking partner goes home.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,554
You and the Commander
tried to have children?

5
00:00:11,555 --> 00:00:14,046
I wanted to. He disagreed.

6
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:16,630
They were always adjusting my dosage.

7
00:00:16,631 --> 00:00:17,917
I wish we could've.

8
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:20,333
- Once Nichole's returned...
- I love you.

9
00:00:20,334 --> 00:00:22,410
We'd do our best
to move the others along quickly.

10
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:24,764
So much leverage comes from the child.

11
00:00:24,765 --> 00:00:25,782
With her back home...

12
00:00:25,783 --> 00:00:27,193
You want me to keep her there.

13
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,934
Just for a bit.

14
00:00:28,935 --> 00:00:30,162
You're not well.

15
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,497
- No.
- June.

16
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:36,692
You're out of your mind.

17
00:00:36,693 --> 00:00:37,775
I can help you.

18
00:00:37,776 --> 00:00:39,804
You'd never have to go
back to Gilead again.

19
00:00:39,805 --> 00:00:41,963
Do you really think that
I would leave my home?

20
00:00:41,964 --> 00:00:43,266
My offer still stands.

21
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:45,112
Treason and coconuts.

22
00:00:45,113 --> 00:00:47,654
I probably won't see my daughters again.

23
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:50,642
She's someone's child, too.

24
00:00:50,643 --> 00:00:54,076
I honor the Handmaid's
life by saving her child's.

25
00:00:54,077 --> 00:00:55,906
How will you honor your daughters?

26
00:00:55,907 --> 00:00:58,164
I don't know how yet,

27
00:00:58,165 --> 00:01:00,843
but I'm gonna get out as
many children as I can.

28
00:01:00,844 --> 00:01:03,892
They all deserve to be free.

00:01:36,082 --> 00:01:38,931
Ofjoseph. Ofjoseph.

31
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,025
Okay, Ofjoseph.

32
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:44,451
Almost there now.

33
00:01:44,452 --> 00:01:45,924
One step at a time, dear.

34
00:01:45,925 --> 00:01:47,427
Almost there.

35
00:01:56,997 --> 00:01:58,028
Blessed day.

36
00:01:58,029 --> 00:01:59,101
Blessed day.

37
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:01,254
Thank you.

38
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,601
Blessed be the fruit.

39
00:02:04,602 --> 00:02:06,605
May the Lord open.

40
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,063
Ofjoseph, you need to get rest today.

41
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,135
You can go straight
upstairs to your room

42
00:02:13,136 --> 00:02:14,232
and take a snooze.

43
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:15,427
Thank you, Aunt Lydia.

44
00:02:15,428 --> 00:02:17,222
Mmm.

45
00:02:17,223 --> 00:02:19,538
<i>But I don't want rest.</i>

46
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,031
<i>I don't want to rest ever again.</i>

47
00:02:21,032 --> 00:02:23,142
Oh!

48
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,168
Oh!

49
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:26,450
Well...

50
00:02:26,451 --> 00:02:28,455
Isn't this a delight?

51
00:02:29,856 --> 00:02:31,410
The Lawrences redecorated.

52
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:34,820
All households
doing their best to conform

53
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,424
to Commander Waterford's
new regulations.

54
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:42,464
Every residence elevated
to D.C. standards.

55
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:46,799
I suppose you've missed a
few things in your time away.

56
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,769
Mmm. Suppose I have.

57
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,222
Perhaps God will deem this household

58
00:02:52,223 --> 00:02:55,274
worthy of a child after all,

59
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,955
should he forgive us for taking you away

60
00:02:57,956 --> 00:03:00,446
from last month's Ceremony.

61
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:02,645
Happily, we've returned you

62
00:03:02,646 --> 00:03:04,896
just in time for the next.

63
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,491
I believe that my time of prayer

64
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,996
has led me to see my true purpose.

65
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,015
Oh.

66
00:03:18,016 --> 00:03:21,902
You are a good girl, Ofjoseph.

67
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:25,856
Go on. I'll let you get settled.

68
00:03:25,857 --> 00:03:27,092
Hmm?

69
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,233
Scones mean no.

70
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:55,648
Welcome home.

71
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,204
"Scones mean no"?

72
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:00,339
A message from the network.

73
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,675
No more medication for Eleanor.

74
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:05,111
I've asked everyone I can think of.

75
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,551
When they can't help, they send scones.

76
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,950
She's getting worse?

77
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:12,990
She throws things now.

78
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,808
- Beth...
- Hmm?

79
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,965
I need you to ask the Marthas
for something else.

80
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,207
Of course you do.

81
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,409
Do you know anyone who could
help me move children out?

82
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:40,054
I'm gonna get them out.

83
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,031
I know how it sounds.

84
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,263
You're gonna get yourself killed.

85
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,015
I said I didn't want it.

86
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:11,051
They can
bring you something else.

87
00:05:11,052 --> 00:05:12,090
I'm not hungry!

88
00:05:12,091 --> 00:05:13,479
Eleanor, sweetheart...

89
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,038
No, just leave me alone!

90
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,076
Eleanor...

91
00:05:16,077 --> 00:05:17,349
Don't you touch me! Get out!

92
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,118
Get out!

93
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,820
Go! Get out of here!

94
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,531
Welcome home.

95
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,401
Thank you, sir.

96
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,756
Reorganizing, sir?

97
00:06:01,757 --> 00:06:03,601
Hmm.

98
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:12,404
Beth told me she can't get
any more of her medication.

99
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:13,512
I would appreciate it

100
00:06:13,513 --> 00:06:16,140
if you would give my wife her privacy.

101
00:06:17,852 --> 00:06:19,492
Well, I'm just worried.

102
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:22,748
You really think she's safe here?

103
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,584
Of course she's safe. This is...

104
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,730
It's her home.

105
00:06:27,731 --> 00:06:29,655
You can't keep her
locked up here forever.

106
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,605
What do you propose I do?

107
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,216
I'm not sending my wife away.

108
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,575
You can leave Gilead with her.

109
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,665
Get a truck.

110
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,717
Get her out.

111
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,843
And get her the help that she needs.

112
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,081
She cannot go on like this.

113
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:34,245
What do you know about

114
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:36,682
how much someone can take?

115
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,059
Everything.

116
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:06,947
<i>He's scared.</i>

117
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,306
<i>Fear can be a great motivator.</i>

118
00:08:13,436 --> 00:08:14,854
<i>Attention shoppers.</i>

119
00:08:14,855 --> 00:08:17,018
<i>Handmaids must remain
with her walking partner</i>

120
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:19,865
<i>at all times. Walk with God.</i>

121
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,701
<i>Another walking partner dead.</i>

122
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,716
<i>They must think I'm cursed.</i>

123
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,985
<i>Or a terrorist.</i>

124
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,241
<i>I'm not, though.</i>

125
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,678
<i>Not yet.</i>

126
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:54,133
I need your help.

127
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,934
I can't help.

128
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,961
They're watching everything we do.

129
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,513
And you're really conspicuous.

130
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:18,257
How many Handmaids' kids
are still in this district?

131
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:20,225
Can you find out?

132
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,927
Why?

133
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,745
Because I'm gonna get them out.

134
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,754
And a lot of them.

135
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:31,183
You'll get put on the wall
just for thinking that.

136
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,818
Are you okay?

137
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:37,787
No.

138
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:40,846
I am not fucking okay.

139
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,383
Inspection?

140
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,390
Another one.

141
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,158
Let's go, girls!

142
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,645
- Move!
- Let's go!

143
00:09:56,646 --> 00:09:58,021
- Quick!
- Hurry up!

144
00:09:58,022 --> 00:09:59,647
Faster!

145
00:09:59,648 --> 00:10:01,642
To your places!

146
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,209
Find your spot, then be still.

147
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,437
All the way out!

148
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,575
Quickly, girls! Move it!

149
00:10:07,576 --> 00:10:10,442
Move it! This is not a parade.

150
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,444
Don't leave any spaces.

151
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,612
Move over!

152
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,845
Make it even. Even spacing.

153
00:10:15,846 --> 00:10:17,663
All the way up!

154
00:10:17,664 --> 00:10:19,585
All the way to the top, girls!

155
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,620
Back row, no talking!

156
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,122
You two, not so close.

157
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,333
Up those stairs!

158
00:10:24,334 --> 00:10:26,370
- Up those stairs!
- Quiet, now.

159
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,858
Heads down.

160
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:32,297
Hands in front.

161
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,782
Excellent.

162
00:10:33,783 --> 00:10:36,445
We want you looking your best

163
00:10:36,446 --> 00:10:38,947
for our very special visitors.

164
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,739
Blessed be the fruit.

165
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,289
Mmm-hmm.

166
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,153
You're looking well.

167
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:29,183
Thank you, sir.

168
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,297
Sorry to keep
you out here in the cold.

169
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,762
I'm fine.

170
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,664
Yes.

171
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:39,874
A Boston girl.

172
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:43,317
Born and bred.

173
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:45,330
Hardy.

174
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,987
It's much warmer in D.C.

175
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,438
I may be able to...

176
00:11:52,439 --> 00:11:55,317
arrange a transfer for you there,

177
00:11:55,318 --> 00:11:57,783
if you prefer.

178
00:11:59,107 --> 00:12:00,991
Your wife is here.

179
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,039
Aunt Lydia will answer

180
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,620
any questions that you might have.

181
00:12:04,621 --> 00:12:07,426
We are honored to have you, Commander.

182
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:09,995
May God bless our endeavor.

183
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,035
Shall we?

184
00:12:11,036 --> 00:12:13,899
I'm curious to see what you have here.

185
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,840
Your girls have...

186
00:12:15,841 --> 00:12:17,370
quite a reputation.

187
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,435
Blessed be the fruit.

188
00:12:27,436 --> 00:12:29,665
May the Lord open.

189
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,448
I think you'll be pleased

190
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:37,382
with the progress we've made
since the Calhoun incident.

191
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:40,225
And two more confirmed pregnancies.

192
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,651
True miracles, indeed.

193
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,301
This is not regulation.

194
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:50,918
Ofhoward's alterations

195
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:53,428
were damaged through criminal actions,

196
00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:55,874
and we decided to make an allowance.

197
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,075
You're comfortable with that

198
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:00,078
in a district that has
fostered violent rebellion?

199
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,248
I am, Commander, at present.

200
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,632
The veil. The ring.

201
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:08,153
We're rolling it out slowly.

202
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,449
And the vow
is voluntary, of course.

203
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,847
We hold the devotion

204
00:13:11,848 --> 00:13:14,191
of veiled Handmaids
to the highest esteem.

205
00:13:14,192 --> 00:13:15,210
Praise be.

206
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,219
How are you feeling?

207
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,858
We'll continue
to encourage their good work.

208
00:13:17,859 --> 00:13:18,897
I'm fine.

209
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,635
Oferic has
faithfully served Commander Simon

210
00:13:20,636 --> 00:13:22,440
- for nearly a year.
- Thank you.

211
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:24,369
She is a model Handmaid.

212
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,642
And how do you
find Commander Simon?

213
00:13:26,643 --> 00:13:28,273
How's your arm?

214
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,518
So young.

215
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,859
We'll get a lot of
mileage out of that one.

216
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,745
George, you remember Ofjoseph?

217
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:34,773
Of course.

218
00:13:34,774 --> 00:13:37,208
Joseph Lawrence is an old friend.

219
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:38,263
Is he?

220
00:13:38,264 --> 00:13:40,872
Yes. Golf buddies...

221
00:13:40,873 --> 00:13:42,548
from before.

222
00:13:42,549 --> 00:13:45,246
Every Sunday after
church. Always...

223
00:13:45,247 --> 00:13:46,892
always an experience.

224
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,293
How do you find Commander Lawrence?

225
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,108
He treats me with respect, sir.

226
00:13:55,109 --> 00:13:56,781
Respect?

227
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,309
I am grateful to be in his service.

228
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,436
Good.

229
00:14:05,437 --> 00:14:06,712
Thank you.

230
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,360
Hmm.

231
00:14:28,862 --> 00:14:30,229
Where is he?

232
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,456
He's at work.

233
00:14:31,457 --> 00:14:33,226
He goes to meetings now.

234
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:31,263
All I want is the TASCHEN <i>Gauguin.</i>

235
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,010
He hides things just to bother me,

236
00:15:33,011 --> 00:15:34,953
I swear to God.

237
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,804
Ha!

238
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,530
Hi.

239
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,200
Hi.

240
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,295
What are you doing?

241
00:15:47,653 --> 00:15:49,585
You're up to something again.

242
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,052
What is it?

243
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,794
Is it your daughter?

244
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,268
No.

245
00:16:03,241 --> 00:16:05,342
Hannah's gone.

246
00:16:05,843 --> 00:16:08,378
Well, tell me
what you're doing in here.

247
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,407
I'm looking for other people's children.

248
00:16:13,408 --> 00:16:15,441
My friends' children.

249
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:18,451
You mean...

250
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:20,067
Handmaids?

251
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:23,383
Yes.

252
00:16:25,436 --> 00:16:27,783
I'm trying to find out where they are.

253
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:33,883
That information is in
The Red Center dossiers.

254
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,254
Right.

255
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,826
Joseph keeps
them in the basement.

256
00:16:51,632 --> 00:16:52,652
Let's go!

257
00:16:52,653 --> 00:16:54,088
I don't have all day.

258
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:01,879
They keep sending
them for him to review.

259
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,016
He just sticks them down here.

260
00:17:05,017 --> 00:17:07,737
Like we need any more clutter.

261
00:17:07,738 --> 00:17:08,763
Oh!

262
00:17:08,764 --> 00:17:11,696
This place is a mess.

263
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,833
What is the point of having
as many maids as you want

264
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:18,043
if they aren't allowed to
actually clean anything?

265
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:28,661
Joseph likes to keep them...

266
00:17:29,898 --> 00:17:32,532
"Of labor resources."

267
00:17:33,645 --> 00:17:34,810
Here they are!

268
00:18:10,352 --> 00:18:12,386
Aha.

269
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:17,878
Oh!

270
00:18:30,002 --> 00:18:32,041
Where is that...

271
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:03,165
_

272
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,213
- Mrs. Lawrence?
- Hmm?

273
00:19:13,214 --> 00:19:15,294
Have you ever
thought about leaving Gilead?

274
00:19:16,425 --> 00:19:18,649
You mean go somewhere where I could get

275
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:22,073
mood stabilizers instead of herbal tea?

276
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,866
Joseph would help you.

277
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,532
You could leave together.

278
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,637
He wants you to be...

279
00:19:36,638 --> 00:19:38,396
safe.

280
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,432
He loves you so much.

281
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:53,041
Joseph is a war criminal.

282
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,078
He can't cross the border.

283
00:20:00,645 --> 00:20:02,632
He would be...

284
00:20:02,633 --> 00:20:04,692
jailed for the rest of his life.

285
00:20:04,693 --> 00:20:06,030
Or...

286
00:20:06,031 --> 00:20:07,573
killed.

287
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,142
And he would deserve it.

288
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,484
Oh, I've been looking for this!

289
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:21,683
Oh!

290
00:20:21,684 --> 00:20:23,653
Oh!

291
00:20:23,654 --> 00:20:25,867
Oh, I'm so glad you're back, Ofjoseph.

292
00:20:25,868 --> 00:20:28,001
Things are always so much more exciting

293
00:20:28,002 --> 00:20:30,092
when you're here.

294
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:35,441
After the bombing last year,

295
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,435
we weren't sure the
district would ever recover.

296
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:40,171
Our community is very
resilient, by His hand.

297
00:20:41,581 --> 00:20:42,846
If only the fringe cities

298
00:20:42,847 --> 00:20:45,685
would be so quick to get
their houses in order.

299
00:20:45,686 --> 00:20:48,731
Has there been pushback on
the new policies elsewhere?

300
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:54,679
Some men are set in their ways.

301
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:58,510
Very true.

302
00:20:59,618 --> 00:21:01,976
Once Gilead
is finally recognized

303
00:21:01,977 --> 00:21:04,444
as a sovereign state, we won't have time

304
00:21:04,445 --> 00:21:07,452
to indulge with those
clinging to old habits.

305
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:10,457
Is there someone in particular that

306
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,232
you're concerned with, Fred?

307
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:14,448
I...

308
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,250
I hesitate to say.

309
00:21:17,251 --> 00:21:18,840
I'd like to hear.

310
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,729
Commander Lawrence.

311
00:21:34,234 --> 00:21:35,660
Lawrence's contributions

312
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,341
to Gilead have been...

313
00:21:37,342 --> 00:21:39,028
substantial.

314
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:40,779
At first.

315
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:45,642
Now, I fear his influence
does more harm than good.

316
00:21:45,643 --> 00:21:46,671
Oh?

317
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,221
He's made some cosmetic changes

318
00:21:48,222 --> 00:21:50,245
to his household, yes, but...

319
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,114
He's had <i>four</i> Handmaids.

320
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:58,584
Not one has produced.

321
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:01,874
And from what I've seen from his

322
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:04,895
<i>current</i> Ofjoseph,

323
00:22:04,896 --> 00:22:07,926
that lack of discipline persists.

324
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:10,448
We may need to...

325
00:22:10,449 --> 00:22:12,635
set an example.

326
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,425
Challenging someone like Lawrence

327
00:22:21,426 --> 00:22:23,286
is a delicate business, Fred.

328
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:26,873
I'm only...

329
00:22:26,874 --> 00:22:30,221
suggesting we make certain that

330
00:22:30,222 --> 00:22:33,221
he and his household
are abiding by Gilead's

331
00:22:33,222 --> 00:22:36,035
most sacred tenets.

332
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,848
There are...

333
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:43,429
mechanisms in place to...

334
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,222
ensure virility.

335
00:22:47,456 --> 00:22:49,604
Isn't that a little extreme?

336
00:22:51,222 --> 00:22:52,526
If he's unfit to lead

337
00:22:52,527 --> 00:22:54,564
his household, he's
unfit to lead Gilead.

338
00:23:02,652 --> 00:23:04,455
Praise be.

339
00:23:17,251 --> 00:23:19,843
<i>It's been five years
since we had our children</i>

340
00:23:19,844 --> 00:23:21,435
<i>torn away from us.</i>

341
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:24,753
<i>An eternity.</i>

342
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:28,973
- <i>They were one.</i>
- _.

343
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:32,006
- <i>Now they're six.</i>
- _

344
00:23:32,007 --> 00:23:33,544
_

345
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:35,777
- <i>They were seven.</i>
- _

346
00:23:35,778 --> 00:23:38,049
_

347
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,157
- <i>Now they're 12.</i>
- _.

348
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,367
<i>We've missed everything.</i>

349
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:50,261
- <i>The steps.</i>
- _.

350
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,279
- <i>The smiles.</i>
- _

351
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,698
_

352
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:56,567
- <i>The tragedies.</i>
- _.

353
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:58,240
- <i>Children still die.</i>
- _.

354
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:01,906
<i>Even in Gilead.</i>

355
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:04,642
<i>Janine's son, Caleb,</i>

356
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,574
<i>four years ago.</i>

357
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,448
<i>Prayers can't stop car accidents.</i>

358
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:13,878
Ofjoseph?

359
00:24:18,034 --> 00:24:20,036
They want you in the sitting room.

360
00:25:33,242 --> 00:25:35,266
Um...

361
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:40,360
You both should stand over there.

362
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,851
What a lovely room.

363
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:33,247
I pray that nothing will impede.

364
00:26:33,248 --> 00:26:35,352
God's will tonight.

365
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:48,906
Come in.

366
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:53,111
Eleanor. Such a pleasure to see you.

367
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:56,714
How are Olivia and the kids?

368
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,249
Couldn't be better.

369
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,951
Shall I get you a drink, George?

370
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,457
I'll help myself, Joseph.

371
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:02,753
Thank you.

372
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:06,424
We sincerely
apologize for... intruding.

373
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:09,861
No, no. The more the merrier.

374
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:11,443
In bearing witness, we...

375
00:27:11,444 --> 00:27:13,675
pray with you for a fruitful outcome.

376
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,435
<i>They used to do this
in the first months of Gilead</i>

377
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:20,031
<i>to the households that
resisted the Ceremony.</i>

378
00:27:21,232 --> 00:27:22,994
<i>They declared it unnecessary.</i>

379
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:25,851
<i>Things change.</i>

380
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,642
The Aunt checked on us before.

381
00:27:28,643 --> 00:27:29,674
Oh!

382
00:27:29,675 --> 00:27:33,117
It's mere formality, Mrs. Lawrence.

383
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:36,035
Shoring up those
households that have had...

384
00:27:36,036 --> 00:27:37,629
difficulties with...

385
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:38,843
Handmaids.

386
00:27:38,844 --> 00:27:41,029
Bearing witness ensures that

387
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,014
every member of the family

388
00:27:43,015 --> 00:27:45,296
is performing their role.

389
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:48,966
Any deviation could tip
the scales to failure.

390
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:51,236
Are you gonna
sit in the bed with us, too?

391
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:53,654
Because that would definitely
make things more interesting.

392
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:56,019
Joseph.

393
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:59,476
Ah, I think it's time to get started.

394
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:14,948
Right.

395
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,716
Of course.

396
00:28:35,295 --> 00:28:36,300
Beth?

397
00:28:45,649 --> 00:28:47,895
Don't move my stuff.

398
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:53,568
Forgetful moments
sneaking up on you there, old man?

399
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:11,406
And when Rachel saw that

400
00:29:12,649 --> 00:29:14,885
she bore Jacob no children,

401
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,153
Rachel envied her sister,

402
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:20,770
and said unto Jacob,

403
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:24,090
"Give me children,

404
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,813
or else I die."

405
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:38,109
Aunt Lydia?

406
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,877
There's no need to worry.

407
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,946
Dr. Michaels will be efficient.

408
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:43,950
Lickety-split.

409
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,633
Ofjoseph.

410
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:38,238
We'll sit here quietly for 20 minutes.

411
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:42,714
And then, we'll go... go down.

412
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,312
We can't just sit here.

413
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:52,083
We can play uh... Canasta.

414
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:54,218
Got some cards up here.

415
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,289
The doctor is going to check me...

416
00:30:58,223 --> 00:30:59,749
afterwards...

417
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,441
for the proof that there was a Ceremony.

418
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:06,706
You swore...

419
00:31:06,707 --> 00:31:07,950
- Eleanor, shh! Quiet!
- We would never...

420
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:08,999
- You need to be quiet!
- Have to do this!

421
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,217
- We don't have to do anything!
- You swore it!

422
00:31:10,218 --> 00:31:11,436
Quiet!

423
00:31:11,437 --> 00:31:14,216
Stop. You need to stop.

424
00:31:14,217 --> 00:31:16,512
We don't have to do anything.

425
00:31:18,035 --> 00:31:19,465
Sir...

426
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,088
Yes, we do.

427
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,920
You helped to create...

428
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:36,147
this world.

429
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,232
How long did you think it would be

430
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:41,445
before it came for you?

431
00:31:41,446 --> 00:31:43,439
Every government makes room

432
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,369
for exceptions.

433
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,184
This one ends
with both of you on the wall.

434
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:54,680
Maybe we deserve it.

435
00:31:54,681 --> 00:31:56,432
I mean...

436
00:31:56,433 --> 00:31:58,984
at least, it would all be over.

437
00:32:00,564 --> 00:32:02,566
You'll be fine.

438
00:32:04,034 --> 00:32:05,049
It's...

439
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,299
It's our sin.

440
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:11,511
Handmaids are required

441
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,064
to report deviancy.

442
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:19,237
Mmm-hmm.

443
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:21,279
And Marthas.

444
00:32:25,233 --> 00:32:27,248
We would all be punished.

445
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,457
No! No!

446
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:31,667
My love! My love!

447
00:32:34,014 --> 00:32:35,048
My love.

448
00:32:35,865 --> 00:32:36,869
No!

449
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,823
You need to be quiet.

450
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:45,286
You need to be quiet.

451
00:32:45,287 --> 00:32:49,167
No!

452
00:32:51,946 --> 00:32:53,969
Look at me.

453
00:32:57,776 --> 00:32:59,318
It's okay.

454
00:33:05,226 --> 00:33:06,447
It's gonna be okay.

455
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:10,701
Look at me.

456
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:13,897
You can do this.

457
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:15,886
Okay?

458
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,506
Come on.

459
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:39,046
Come over here.

460
00:33:39,047 --> 00:33:41,018
Sit right there.

461
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:48,024
It doesn't mean anything.

462
00:33:50,015 --> 00:33:51,798
No matter what happens.

463
00:33:53,022 --> 00:33:55,030
It's okay, my love.

464
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:57,971
You are the love of my life.

465
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,376
You are my love.

466
00:34:30,855 --> 00:34:32,861
You just treat it like a job.

467
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,095
Try to detach yourself.

468
00:34:37,845 --> 00:34:39,864
See it from the outside.

469
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:46,448
You're not you.

470
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:48,644
I'm not me.

471
00:34:48,645 --> 00:34:50,670
This is a transaction.

472
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:57,533
And then it's over.

473
00:35:02,448 --> 00:35:03,747
Are you sure?

474
00:35:08,853 --> 00:35:10,039
Mmm-hmm.

475
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,802
It's easier if you close your eyes.

476
00:36:42,859 --> 00:36:44,598
Where is Mrs. Lawrence?

477
00:37:15,273 --> 00:37:16,289
Eleanor?

478
00:37:21,457 --> 00:37:23,466
Serena.

479
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:29,633
I'm so sorry.

480
00:37:29,634 --> 00:37:32,697
It's been so long
since we've had dinner.

481
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:22,080
Let's see what we have.

482
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:34,007
Any pain or discomfort?

483
00:38:34,008 --> 00:38:35,145
No, sir.

484
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,035
Bleeding or cramping?

485
00:38:38,036 --> 00:38:39,507
No, sir. All good.

486
00:38:40,846 --> 00:38:41,879
Great.

487
00:38:42,642 --> 00:38:45,397
May He see fit to bring
about His blessed miracle.

488
00:38:46,426 --> 00:38:48,453
May I be truly worthy.

489
00:39:00,872 --> 00:39:03,340
A successful Ceremony.

490
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,057
Praise be.

491
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:09,549
Praise be.

492
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:13,567
We should give the
Lawrences back their privacy.

493
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:19,356
He does have good Scotch.

494
00:39:39,861 --> 00:39:42,491
Are you... all right?

495
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:47,325
Mmm-hmm.

496
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:50,656
I mean,

497
00:39:52,257 --> 00:39:54,270
at least it wasn't you.

498
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,049
How is Eleanor?

499
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:04,109
She's very quiet.

500
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,846
A collector's item.

501
00:41:31,874 --> 00:41:33,628
The punishment for contraception

502
00:41:33,629 --> 00:41:36,067
is being torn apart by dogs.

503
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:41,608
That's right.

504
00:41:49,645 --> 00:41:52,850
That's not gonna be the
last time that happens.

505
00:41:52,851 --> 00:41:54,882
You know that, right?

506
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,921
I know.

507
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,643
I'll get you a truck.

508
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:37,347
You get my wife out safely.

509
00:42:49,435 --> 00:42:51,429
You can get out, too.

510
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:01,220
You just have to bring them something.

511
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:07,358
Something valuable.

512
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,395
Kids.

513
00:43:16,651 --> 00:43:19,041
The stolen children of Gilead.

514
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:33,178
I'd be a hero.

515
00:44:10,632 --> 00:44:11,839
What do you want?

516
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,423
I have a plan.

517
00:44:13,424 --> 00:44:15,191
You're like a nightmare right now.

518
00:44:16,014 --> 00:44:18,046
Dylan's new name is Joshua.

519
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,161
He's five, right?

520
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:24,763
He lives in Amherst,
with a Commander's family.

521
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:28,866
And he's blond.

522
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:38,877
His dad was blond.

523
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,108
How long are we gonna
let Gilead keep him?

524
00:45:05,277 --> 00:45:06,312
What's your plan?

525
00:45:08,973 --> 00:45:11,355
I have a truck. I think
it fits 10. I've seen it.

526
00:45:11,356 --> 00:45:13,217
And you?

527
00:45:13,218 --> 00:45:15,224
I'm not leaving without Hannah.

528
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,348
We can't do something
like that ourselves.

529
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:20,053
I know that.

530
00:45:20,054 --> 00:45:21,488
I can help.

531
00:45:24,635 --> 00:45:26,192
What? I'm brave.

532
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:34,864
Sasha's little girl is
still in the Torrance house.

533
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:36,833
Just a few blocks from me.

534
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:39,135
She's old enough. And quiet.

535
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:40,514
I'll ask around.

536
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:00,457
June?

537
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:02,189
Mmm-hmm?

538
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:05,725
Did you find out anything about Caleb?

539
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:12,360
Yeah.

540
00:46:13,352 --> 00:46:14,363
I did.

541
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:24,145
His family was
transferred to California.

542
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:30,496
His mom seems super nice.

543
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,841
He lives on the beach?

544
00:46:45,642 --> 00:46:46,908
Yeah.

545
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,253
He lives on the beach.

546
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:25,509
I know last night was difficult.

547
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:30,214
Thank you for your resilience.

548
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:34,611
Well, we have to be a united front.

549
00:47:40,012 --> 00:47:41,365
Always.

550
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:55,423
Fred, you've done so much for Gilead.

551
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,453
And I see that.

552
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,491
But you're getting distracted.

553
00:48:02,492 --> 00:48:04,453
It's been months,

554
00:48:04,454 --> 00:48:07,417
and we're no closer to Nichole.

555
00:48:07,418 --> 00:48:09,026
I'm assuring a life for her.

556
00:48:09,027 --> 00:48:12,297
You're prioritizing yourself.

557
00:48:18,206 --> 00:48:20,212
And that's enough now.

558
00:48:21,768 --> 00:48:22,968
Serena...

559
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:26,632
I thought that
the Gilead channels

560
00:48:26,633 --> 00:48:28,666
were the only way to get to Nichole,

561
00:48:28,667 --> 00:48:30,082
but they're not.

562
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:37,217
I met someone in Canada who can help us.

563
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:40,979
An American.

564
00:49:01,096 --> 00:49:04,134
You just have to offer your cooperation.

565
00:49:36,628 --> 00:49:38,645
I did what you asked.

566
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:42,169
The Marthas?

567
00:49:43,414 --> 00:49:44,877
Muffins mean yes.

568
00:49:54,246 --> 00:49:55,525
I spread the word.

569
00:49:55,526 --> 00:49:56,656
I asked if anyone would

570
00:49:56,657 --> 00:49:58,995
help get children out.

571
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,020
I thought they'd all say no.

572
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:14,978
We're gonna need a bigger boat.

573
00:50:23,686 --> 00:50:28,686

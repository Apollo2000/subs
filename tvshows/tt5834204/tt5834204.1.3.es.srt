00:10:45,475 --> 00:10:47,575
No, not that I've noticed.

159
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:50,375
It'd be too early
for any of that.
Yeah.

160
00:10:51,915 --> 00:10:53,375
Is the Putnam's
cake ready?

161
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,790
Yes, ma'am.
I just need to
wrap it up.

162
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,520
Well, it isn't
ready then, is it?

163
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,390
No, ma'am.

164
00:11:14,237 --> 00:11:17,137
I'm going to have a visit
with baby Angela today.

165
00:11:19,176 --> 00:11:20,936
Would you like
to come along?

166
00:11:24,648 --> 00:11:27,948
It would be nice to have
a change of scenery,
don't you think?

167
00:11:32,355 --> 00:11:33,415
Yes, I...

168
00:11:34,492 --> 00:11:36,962
I'd like that very much,
Mrs. Waterford.

169
00:11:37,895 --> 00:11:39,095
Good.

170
00:11:40,798 --> 00:11:43,098
Well, I'll get
myself cleaned up.

171
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:47,296
You finish your lunch.
Every bite, now.

172
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,270
You need to be in
the clean‐plate club.

173
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:50,339
(CHUCKLES)

174
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,530
Oh, she's such an angel.

175
00:12:12,596 --> 00:12:14,396
(CHUCKLES)

176
00:12:14,464 --> 00:12:16,304
She's already
gained two pounds.

177
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:18,797
It's very important.

178
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:21,239
LEAH: You look really
comfortable like that, Serena.

179
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,840

(BABY COOS)

182
00:12:29,747 --> 00:12:31,047
Would you like to hold her?

183
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:37,489
Here she is.

184
00:12:37,555 --> 00:12:41,085
(BABY COOS)
(SHUSHES)

185
00:12:43,226 --> 00:12:44,956
CAROLINE: Do you think
that's a good idea?

186
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:48,268
(SHUSHES) Offred knows.
She's done it before.

187
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:51,937
(SIGHS) Isn't she beautiful?

188
00:13:11,989 --> 00:13:13,219
(WHISPERS) Hello.

189
00:13:16,226 --> 00:13:18,626
CAROLINE: If you don't mind.
SERENA JOY: Of course.

190
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:24,773
Oh, there we go.

191
00:13:24,835 --> 00:13:26,495
Yes, let's get you over here.

192
00:13:27,805 --> 00:13:30,805
NAOMI: I'm sorry,
I'm sure you're all starving.

193
00:13:30,874 --> 00:13:34,014
We've just been enjoying our
time with your beautiful baby.

194
00:13:34,077 --> 00:13:35,207
Oh, put the cookies
on the table.

195
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:37,108
Oh, she's enjoyable now.
But...

196
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,650
In the middle
of the night,
not so much.

197
00:13:39,717 --> 00:13:42,247
I don't think I'd
survive without my coffee.

198
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,260
What happened to your hand?

199
00:13:45,322 --> 00:13:48,062
Oh, it's nothing.
Just one of those things.

200
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,290
Angela had finished
her breakfast,

201
00:13:51,361 --> 00:13:53,001
and I was picking her up.

202
00:13:53,063 --> 00:13:58,643
And that girl,
that ungrateful girl,
she snapped at me.

203
00:13:58,702 --> 00:13:59,842
She bit you?
Mmm‐hmm.

204
00:13:59,903 --> 00:14:01,173
You know how they get.

205
00:14:01,238 --> 00:14:03,038
I'm just counting the days
until Angela's weaned

206
00:14:03,106 --> 00:14:06,576
and that girl is
out of my house.

207
00:14:07,778 --> 00:14:08,978
Hmm.

208

(BABY COOS)
(BELL TOLLING)

209
00:14:46,116 --> 00:14:47,376
Oh, hi!
OFFRED: Hey.

210
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,590
Did you see my baby?
Isn't she beautiful?

211
00:14:51,955 --> 00:14:53,555
OFFRED: She's so beautiful.
Yeah.

212
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:56,025
Yeah.

213
00:14:56,093 --> 00:14:58,303
How are you doing?

214
00:14:58,361 --> 00:15:02,031
Oh, I was...
I was so worried

215
00:15:02,099 --> 00:15:03,429
that she would
look like her father.

216
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:05,701
Caleb looked
like his father.
Mmm.

217
00:15:07,004 --> 00:15:09,444
(SHAKILY)
But she does...
She looks...

218
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:12,107
She looks like me. Yeah.
Mmm‐hmm.

219
00:15:15,913 --> 00:15:19,783
Janine, did you... Did you
bite Mrs. Putnam?

220
00:15:24,955 --> 00:15:26,585
You can't do that.

221
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:31,361
Well, she is a cunt.

222
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:39,344
Well, you can't...
No, you don't understand.

223
00:15:39,402 --> 00:15:45,112
She is always
grabbing Charlotte.

224
00:15:45,175 --> 00:15:46,705
She's always
just grabbing at her.

225
00:15:46,777 --> 00:15:48,447
And I told her
I was still feeding her,

226
00:15:48,512 --> 00:15:51,652
she wasn't done eating,
and she just grabbed
her from me.

227
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:57,319
Charlotte?

228
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:02,289
Oh, yeah.
That's her real name.

229
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,470
Janine,
you cannot bite people.

230
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:14,506
Can I tell you a secret?

231
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,480
Mmm‐hmm.

232
00:16:20,778 --> 00:16:23,208
(SOFTLY) I can do
anything I want.

233
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:30,787
I can.

234
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:36,130
I had a baby.
A good one!

235
00:16:36,193 --> 00:16:38,403
I had a good one!

236
00:16:38,461 --> 00:16:40,561
And so they don't care.

237
00:16:40,631 --> 00:16:43,471
I can do anything I want.
I can have ice cream.

238
00:16:43,534 --> 00:16:44,544
(CHUCKLES)

239
00:16:44,602 --> 00:16:46,802
It's only vanilla,
but I can have it.

240
00:16:48,205 --> 00:16:49,665
Oh, would you like some?

241
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:53,839
Sure. I would love
some ice cream.
Yes!

242
00:16:53,911 --> 00:16:56,881
Yay! Okay!
Let's go, let's go.

243
00:17:00,618 --> 00:17:04,248
(WHISPERS) Can I
tell you another secret?
Mmm‐hmm.

244
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:06,318
Um...

245
00:17:06,389 --> 00:17:08,129
You can't
tell anyone, okay?

246
00:17:10,127 --> 00:17:11,327
Okay.

247
00:17:12,763 --> 00:17:13,803
Okay.

248
00:17:18,636 --> 00:17:20,136
He...

249
00:17:20,203 --> 00:17:23,343
He loves me.
(LAUGHS)

250
00:17:23,406 --> 00:17:25,736
He loves me so much.
(GIGGLES)

251
00:17:28,746 --> 00:17:29,776
Who?

252
00:17:30,914 --> 00:17:33,654
(WHISPERS) Him. My Commander.

253
00:17:36,219 --> 00:17:38,219
He loves you?
Yes!

254
00:17:39,456 --> 00:17:42,986
He loves me
and he loves Charlotte.

255
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,290
And...

256
00:17:46,096 --> 00:17:49,326
We are going to
run away together.

257
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:51,774
(LAUGHS)

258
00:17:58,075 --> 00:17:59,305
He said that?

259
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:04,519
You don't have
to believe me.

260
00:18:05,983 --> 00:18:08,753
But, yes, he loves me.

261
00:18:13,757 --> 00:18:14,857
We're going...

262
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:19,755
We're gonna be
a real family.

263

Thank you. We'll wait.

265
00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:09,375
Did you have fun?

266
00:19:12,082 --> 00:19:13,282
Yes.

267
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:16,421
Thank you.

268
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:18,687
Did you get a chance
to visit with your friend?

269
00:19:20,323 --> 00:19:22,393
I'm sorry. I should've
asked permission.

270
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:23,989
It's fine.

271
00:19:24,061 --> 00:19:26,661
I imagine you two have a lot
to talk about these days.

Yes.

275
00:19:40,944 --> 00:19:43,814
But I'm afraid
she might be
losing touch.

276
00:19:45,683 --> 00:19:47,853
Well, that can
happen sometimes...

277

With the weaker girls.

278
00:19:55,258 --> 00:19:56,488
You know, what you do,

279
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,360
what we do together
is so terrible...

280
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:09,341
It's terribly hard,
and we must remain strong.

281
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,478
Which is why I feel
so blessed to have you.

(BABY CONTINUES CRYING)

283
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:22,849
Why don't you go
on and tell Nick

284
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,360
I'll have Mrs. Putnam's
driver take me home.

285

I think Naomi
could use some help.

Yes, Mrs. Waterford.

287
00:20:50,313 --> 00:20:51,983
Have you seen
the Putnam's baby?

288
00:20:53,517 --> 00:20:54,817
She's really cute.

289
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,790
I love fat babies.

Hmm?

292

You said she was dangerous.

293
00:21:15,606 --> 00:21:16,836
What'd you mean?

294
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:20,482
You need to remember
a few things.

295
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,850
You can't change
anything about this.

296
00:21:24,915 --> 00:21:26,515
It's gonna end the same
no matter what you do,

297
00:21:26,584 --> 00:21:29,324
so there's no point trying
to be tough or brave.

part of any of this.

know, just tell them.

froze any account with an "F"
on it instead of an "M."

00:22:37,588 --> 00:22:39,488
I have $4,000
in that account.

All they needed to do
was just push a few buttons.

She isn't your property.

you to take care of her.

go in the kitchen

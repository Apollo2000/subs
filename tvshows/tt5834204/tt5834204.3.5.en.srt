1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,250
<i>Previously on</i>
The Handmaid's Tale...

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,190
The Commander
wants to reconcile,

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,080
but he doesn't know
how to do it so,

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,840
I made a suggestion.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,160
Could you maybe give her

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,780
a real voice?
Behind the scenes.

7
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,500
If that would fix things.

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,680
It's worth discussing.

9
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,200
Wear the dress.
Pull the strings.

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,040
Have you found her respectful?

11
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,870
We've had trouble
with her in the past.

12
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,040
Yes.

13
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,340
I want to go now.

14
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,070
All right, my love.

15
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,860
A young girl of Hannah's age

16
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,320
would attend a school
for domestic arts.

17
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,240
The one in her district
is in Brookline,

18
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,750
by the reservoir.

19
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,940
Thank you, S...

20
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,420
You know that man?

21
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,320
Is it Lucas Bankole?

22
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,700
I love you.

23
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,870
Yes.

24
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,400
She's gotten so big.

25
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,860
<i>She's out.</i>

26
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,480
<i>She's safe.</i>

27
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,620
<i>She's with Luke.</i>

28
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,240
<i>May He and His goodness</i>

29
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,450
<i>bless us with miracles,</i>

30
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,910
<i>for we are weary</i>

31
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,540
<i>and weak of faith.</i>

32
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,870
<i>Maybe it's not a miracle.</i>

33
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,900
<i>A miracle is beyond
human powers.</i>

34
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,660
<i>I did this.</i>

35
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,520
<i>We.</i>

36
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,230
<i>It's a dream.</i>

37
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,060
<i>The only dream for a Handmaid</i>

38
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,870
<i>in Gilead.</i>

39
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,660
<i>My baby is free.</i>

40
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,680
Praise be.

41
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,870
<i>They could resent me.</i>

42
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,190
<i>I wouldn't blame them.</i>

43
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,410
Praise be.

44
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,880
<i>Instead of resentment,
they offer grace.</i>

45
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,000
<i>A victory for one
is a victory for all.</i>

46
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,440
<i>I want him here so badly.</i>

47
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,400
<i>I want to be held</i>

48
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,410
<i>and told my name.</i>

49
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,040
<i>Absence makes
the heart grow fonder.</i>

50
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,490
<i>Maybe.</i>

51
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,140
<i>What about the rest of me?</i>

52
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,250
<i>The night we made Hannah.</i>

53
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,910
<i>If I thought</i>

54
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,230
<i>I would never touch him again,</i>

55
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,740
<i>never have him,</i>

56
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,750
<i>I would die.</i>

57
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,030
<i>But nobody dies
from lack of sex.</i>

58
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,370
<i>It's lack of love we die from.</i>

59
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,280
I pray for your husband.

60
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,270
That is kind of you, Ofmatthew.

61
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,670
I pray he returns Baby Nichole

62
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,670
to her rightful home.

63
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,250
Her rightful home
is with her parents.

64
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,860
Praise be.

65
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,980
I know he'll do the right thing.

66
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,670
You wouldn't have married a man

67
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,460
who is actually capable
of kidnapping.

68
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,240
You have much better
judgement than that.

69
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,270
Under His eye.

70
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,810
Bite me.

71
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,440
Sienna?

72
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,460
Sienna?

73
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,880
Never mind.

74
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,670
Did you do...

75
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,670
something different?

76
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,650
Your hair.

77
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,060
A little.

78
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,660
It looks nice.

79
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,860
Like it used to.

80
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,880
Thank you.

81
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,640
Good morning, dear.

82
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,050
Good morning,
Mrs. Lawrence.

83
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,770
Blessed day, Commander.

84
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,780
The answer
is "no."

85
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,090
You want something.

86
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,520
I can tell.

87
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,020
I just need to know

88
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,290
if my husband is safe.

89
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,880
I don't know.
Does he use a seat belt?

90
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
Does he watch
his blood pressure?

91
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,240
That's the silent killer,
you know.

92
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,690
They know where he is now.

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,040
They know he has my daughter.

94
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,740
And isn't that what you wanted?

95
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,350
Do you think they
would try to hurt him?

96
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,910
They?

97
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,420
Do you think he's in danger?

98
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,530
We're all in danger.

99
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,520
What a blessing.

100
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,040
To have seen her.

101
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,010
To know that she's all right.

102
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,970
She's with a stranger.

103
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,490
A stranger to you.

104
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,650
Yes.

105
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,240
To me.

106
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,670
You're finished already?

107
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,020
What did they say?

108
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,690
Oh, they've just gotten started.

109
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,620
I'd like you to join us.

110
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,330
You have a say in this.

111
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,240
We lodged

112
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,060
a preliminary complaint
to Canada,

113
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,260
petitioning
for Nichole's return.

114
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,650
And we will follow up.

115
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,660
A child of Gilead

116
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,040
has been kidnapped.

117
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,250
You're suggesting we send them

118
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,480
another stern note?

119
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,870
No, Commander.
I'm saying

120
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,860
that our options are limited

121
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,260
without an extradition treaty.

122
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,250
Gentlemen.

123
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,040
Pray excuse me.

124
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,070
Serena?

125
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,250
I'd like to know about the man

126
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,470
who is raising her.

127
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,110
He worked in the...

128
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,740
Suffolk County Office
of Urban Planning.

129
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,750
Before.

130
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,070
And now?

131
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,460
Part-time construction

132
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,230
and utility work.

133
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,890
He receives...

134
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:41,960
refugee aid.

135
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,020
Is he a man of faith?

136
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,440
Of course not.

137
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,870
He did baptize

138
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,870
his first child.

139
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,460
But, to our knowledge,
that's the extent

140
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,260
of his religious activities.

141
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,020
We have been able to access

142
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,020
some medical records.

143
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,450
Nichole's up to date

144
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,530
on her vaccinations.

145
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,070
She's measuring
60th percentile for height

146
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,930
and 55th for weight.

147
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:07,960
And...

148
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,630
It says here she has a tooth.

149
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,990
And we will do whatever it takes

150
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,120
to bring her back home to you.

151
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,080
I thought this is
what you wanted.

152
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,350
Our daughter's safe.

153
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,600
In Canada.

154
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,870
I'm grateful.

155
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,190
But?

156
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,570
Help me understand.

157
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,220
What is it that you want?

158
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,680
I want to be with her,

159
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,700
but that's impossible.

160
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,090
I just want this to be over.

161
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,250
They're here for you.

162
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,910
In the parlor.

163
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,660
Ofjoseph.

164
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,700
Blessed be the fruit.

165
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,360
May the Lord open.

166
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,670
They're just here
to have a conversation.

167
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,090
Sit.

168
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,250
We'd like to arrange...

169
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,720
a visit with Nichole.

170
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,750
As you can imagine,

171
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,850
seeing our daughter
has opened up

172
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,990
a terrible wound
for Mrs. Waterford.

173
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,470
Just one visit to say goodbye.

174
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,950
Your husband will be protected.

175
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,870
My husband?

176
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,040
<i>Everyone</i> will be protected.

177
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
You have my word.

178
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,060
Mine as well.

179
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,150
Your word?

180
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,730
What do I have to do?

181
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,330
Call your husband.

182
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,080
No.

183
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,400
Will you please
give us a moment?

184
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,030
Of course.

185
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,870
No.

186
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,650
I know that

187
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,460
I can't be with her.

188
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,220
I just want to be
something <i>to</i> her.

189
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,240
That's not gonna help.

190
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,640
Okay?

191
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,250
It's not gonna be
what you think.

192
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,020
Please.

193
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,670
Please.
I am begging you.

194
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,600
June.

195
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,210
You don't think I wanna see her?

196
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,880
If I do this,

197
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,430
what do I get?

198
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,040
You get to see her.

199
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,000
So...

200
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,970
what do I get?

201
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,560
What do you want?

202
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,680
I want you to owe me.

203
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,590
Under His eye.

204
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,060
You have two minutes.

205
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,970
It's $47.56.

206
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,860
This will barely
last us the week.

207
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,390
How do people
pay for this stuff?

208
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:54,320
Most don't need it.

209
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,920
All right.

210
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,050
All right, see ya.

211
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,680
Hmm.

212
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,120
Hello.

213
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,260
<i>Hello?</i>

214
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,880
<i>Who is this?</i>

215
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,470
Luke.

216
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,640
It's me.

217
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,230
<i>Don't hang up.</i>

218
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,630
Oh, God.

219
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,640
June?

220
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,260
<i>Oh!</i>

221
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,860
Hi.

222
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,030
<i>June, I, uh...</i>

223
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,150
<i>Oh, June.</i>

224
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,810
I'm okay, Luke.
Hannah's okay.

225
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,120
<i>She's all right.</i>

226
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,050
Where... where are you?

227
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,060
<i>Still here.
I'm in Gilead.</i>

228
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,680
June, um...

229
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,800
I love...

230
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,210
I love you.

231
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,650
<i>I love you so much.</i>

232
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,300
I love you.

233
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,320
God, I love you.

234
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,870
<i>I love you.</i>

235
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,870
<i>Oh, baby.
I... I miss you.</i>

236
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,040
<i>I think about you every day.</i>

237
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,470
<i>I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.</i>

238
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,150
- Don't.
<i>- I...</i>

239
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,270
Don't be sorry.

240
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,760
No, I should've tried
harder to find you.

241
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,320
<i>And Hannah.</i>

242
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,650
I don't have much time.

243
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,310
Yeah. Are you...
Are you all right?

244
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,360
Did they hurt you?

245
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,260
No.

246
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,030
<i>Are they there?</i>

247
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,050
<i>Are they listening?</i>

248
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,900
Luke, please.

249
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,050
I'm all right.
I promise.

250
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,300
I need you to listen to me.

251
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,100
<i>Yeah.
Yeah, baby.</i>

252
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,050
I need you to do
something for me.

253
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,680
<i>Yeah, anything.</i>

254
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,790
I need you to go to

255
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,250
the Toronto airport tomorrow

256
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,100
and meet the Waterfords,

257
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,610
and bring Nichole.

258
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,870
<i>Luke.</i>

259
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,040
- Luke.
<i>- Yeah. I'm...</i>

260
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,690
<i>I'm... I'm here.</i>

261
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,740
June...

262
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,100
You want me to meet
the Waterfords?

263
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,110
<i>Just once.</i>

264
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,870
<i>To say goodbye.</i>

265
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,890
<i>You'll get another call</i>

266
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,190
<i>with all of the details.</i>

267
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,290
Please.

268
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,290
I need you to say yes.

269
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,640
Not him.

270
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,670
Not him.

271
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,300
Just her.

272
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,670
<i>Okay.</i>

273
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,970
Okay.

274
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,880
<i>Okay.</i>

275
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,880
I love you.

276
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,490
May I be dismissed, sir?

277
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,980
You may.

278
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,260
God bless you.

279
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,170
How did she sound?

280
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,580
Like June.

281
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,360
How are you holding up, dear?

282
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,230
Very well,
Mrs. Lawrence.

283
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,860
Thank you.

284
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,670
That must've been painful,

285
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,710
after all that time.

286
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,570
It didn't go quite
as I'd imagined.

287
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,160
What matters...

288
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,270
is...

289
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,890
that...

290
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,320
your love came through.

291
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,150
Sometimes words fail us.

292
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,070
My husband used music.

293
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,460
He used to curate cassette tapes

294
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,210
for me in college.

295
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,860
Hmm.

296
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,260
I still have them

297
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,000
in the basement.

298
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,670
Do you ever listen to them?

299
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,240
I...

300
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,840
I miss the man who made them.

301
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,670
Maybe there's just

302
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,580
a little bit of him left.

303
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,520
He helped me.

304
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,770
He helped Emily.

305
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,660
I think...

306
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,620
it's okay to take
a sliver of someone...

307
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,970
and hold on to that.

308
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,700
Especially if it's all you have.

Your breakfast,
Mrs. Waterford.

328
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:35,030
I'm still full from dinner.

329
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,870
Well, for the flight then.

330
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,890
Do you think
that she'll like it?

331
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,870
"For this child
I prayed."

332
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,720
Oh, it's beautiful.

333
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,700
Would you give her a kiss
from me, please?

334
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,730
Of course.

335
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,640
Ma'am, there's something else.

336
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,680
It arrived last night.

337
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,550
What is it?

338
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,580
It didn't have
my name on it, ma'am.

339
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,030
The car is here.

340
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,130
I'll wrap this up
for the flight.

341
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,550
Thank you, Rita.

342
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,880
Let's go.

343
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,590
Blessed day,
Mrs. Waterford.

344
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,880
Under His eye.

345
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,210
Mrs. Waterford.

346
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,220
Welcome.

347
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,570
Mr. Tuello.

348
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,870
You remember me.
I'm flattered.

349
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,880
I'm just here to make sure
this goes smoothly.

350
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,180
I know how to conduct myself.

351
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,080
Mr. Tuello will take it
from here.

352
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,220
The Commander
gave me strict orders.

353
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,440
I speak for the Commander

354
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,750
in his absence.

355
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,460
Yes, Mrs. Waterford.

356
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,260
It's a short drive
to the terminal.

357
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,880
You'll change there.

358
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,030
I'm sorry?

359
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,050
Mr. Bankole
requested

360
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,010
a more public meeting place.

361
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,870
We brought you
a change of clothes.

362
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,900
We want you to blend in.

363
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:19,490
Right this way,
Mrs. Waterford.

364
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,050
<i>Attention passengers</i>

365

00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,250
I'll introduce you.

374
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,260
No.
Not yet.

375
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,040
Serena Waterford.

376
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,320
Luke Bankole.

377
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,660
Hello.

378
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,370
I could stay.

379
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,370
I leave that up
to Mr. Bankole.

380
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:37,030
You can go.

381
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,280
I won't be far.

382
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,430
God bless you.

383
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,300
Fuck you.

384
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:52,150
I understand this wasn't
an easy choice for you.

385
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,270
I thank you for making it.

386
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,270
I did this for my wife.

387
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,250
She's gained so much weight.

388
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,030
She started eating solids yet?

389
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,880
She's not a fan of the peas.

390
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,590
Is June okay?

391
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,320
Yes.
She's been reassigned.

392
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,610
Where?

393
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,060
I want a name.

394
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,260
Your wife is
perfectly safe, Mr. Bankole.

395
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,990
That's a lie.

396
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,850
His name is Joseph Lawrence.

397
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,600
I know.

398
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,940
What do you want out of this?

399
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,380
This visit?

400
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,630
I just wanted
to see my daughter.

401
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,730
She's not your daughter.

402
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,320
Or yours.

403
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,680
Okay, you understand

404
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,900
this is not about biology,

405
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,800
and I hope that you'll
explain that to her

406
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,000
when she's old enough
to understand.

407
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,180
She'll never be old enough
to understand.

408
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,450
Every child has a right

409
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:25,770
- to their own story.
- Yeah?

410
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,340
Even if that story
is complicated.

411
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,210
And what's your husband's
role in that story?

412
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,560
I'd like for Nichole
to have this.

413
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,310
This was a gift from my father,

414
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,330
God rest his soul.

415
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,890
I don't know what it is

416
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,880
that you tell yourself

417
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,840
so that, you know,
you can sleep at night,

418
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,680
but Nichole is gonna know

419
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,770
exactly where she came from,

420
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:06,040
and how brave her <i>mother</i> was

421
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,450
for getting her here.

422
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,450
That's her story.

423
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,520
All right?

424
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,790
You're never gonna be
anything to her.

425
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:21,070
You wanna know
what I tell myself?

426
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,350
That she was my miracle,

427
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,250
and that I let her go.

428
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,410
Because I wanted
a better life for her,

429
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,540
and so did your wife.

430
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,250
Okay?

431
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,240
So.

432
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,060
If you can't honor
my wishes then...

433
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,270
honor hers.

434
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,250
Please, give this to Nichole,

435
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,480
and let her draw
her own conclusions.

436
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,490
You need to understand
that I protected your wife.

437
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,540
What did you say?

438
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,740
You what?

439
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,490
I'm sorry,
but we need to wrap this up.

440
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:08,880
Good.

441
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,250
Yeah, good, good.

442
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,500
Okay, I'll take it.

443
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,560
Is there something

444
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,580
you want me to tell your wife?

445
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,180
No.

446
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,940
I love you, my sweet girl.

447
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,280
I love you so much.

448
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,700
I love you.

449
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,800
Do you wanna hold her?

450
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,220
Yes, please.

451
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,290
Oh, my baby girl.

452
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:01,880
Hi.

453
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,520
Oh, oh!

454
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,360
You don't have to change back.

455
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,630
My offer still stands.

456
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,040
Treason and coconuts.

457
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:36,660
I only have one home,
Mr. Tuello.

458
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,710
You understand that, don't you?

459
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:41,100
Yes.

460
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,750
I used to live in Atlanta.

461
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,000
Well, I hope you
get back there someday.

00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,080
Yes.

509
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:13,060
Your Commander must be pleased?

510
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,450
I haven't told him yet.

511
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:18,850
Not with everyone so concerned

512
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:20,060
over baby Nichole.

513
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,640
There hasn't been a moment.

514
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,410
I'm glad she's safe.

515
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,220
Your husband, too.

516
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,610
Thanks.

517
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,140
You, too.

518
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:47,100
I really think
everything's gonna be okay.

519
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,790
Ofjoseph.

520
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,290
Please come with me.

00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,130
<i>Hi.</i>

526
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,240
This is so weird.

527
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:04,710
And I'm sorry.

528
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,060
I'm sorry about that.

529
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,330
<i>But...</i>

530
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:12,520
<i>there are some things
that I need to tell you</i>

531
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,240
<i>that I couldn't...</i>

532
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,920
<i>before.</i>

533
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,200
I can't imagine

534
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,440
what you thought when you met...

535
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,430
Nichole.

536
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:28,210
<i>But you were probably
thinking a lot less</i>

537
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:31,280
<i>about her journey
across the border</i>

538
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,150
<i>and more about her journey
into the world.</i>

539
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:42,830
It's not easy
to tell you this...

540
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,350
'cause I am ashamed.

541
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:56,340
<i>I had to build a life here.</i>

542
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:59,840
<i>Of a sort.</i>

543
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,850
<i>And you should, too.</i>

544
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,710
<i>You deserve a life,</i>

545
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:05,690
<i>a full life, Luke.</i>

546
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,710
You deserve love.

547
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:12,300
And you'll always have...

548
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,190
You'll always have mine but...

549
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,450
<i>I understand if...</i>

550
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:22,230
<i>you maybe need more than that.</i>

551
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:28,110
I need you to know
that Nichole...

552
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:32,830
She was born out of love.

553
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:39,460
<i>Her real name's Holly.</i>

554
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,930
And her...

555
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,420
Her father is a driver

556
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,920
named Nick.

557
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,780
<i>You met him.</i>

558
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:55,000
He helped me

559
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,430
to survive.

560
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,130
<i>I</i> need <i>to believe that you</i>

561
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:06,130
<i>can forgive me.</i>

562
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,530
<i>I'm not the woman you remember.</i>

563
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:16,120
<i>She's part of me.</i>

564
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,660
<i>But I'm doing what I need to,</i>

565
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,080
<i>to survive.</i>

566
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,390
<i>You should, too.</i>

567
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:25,390
<i>No, you...</i>

568
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:27,260
<i>You have to.</i>

569
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,720
<i>You have to for Hannah.</i>

570
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,950
<i>It's all for her, Luke.</i>

571
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,660
<i>This is all for her.</i>

572
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:38,850
<i>I promise you,</i>

573
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:42,410
<i>I am trying to get to her.</i>

574
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:44,950
<i>I promise.</i>

575
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,900
I love you.

576
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:54,460
<i>I love you.</i>

577
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:03,040
Blessed day, dear.

578
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:07,150
What's going on?

579
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:09,180
Well, aren't you a Nosy Nellie?

580
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,490
All right.

581
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,800
All right.

582
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,990
Over here, dear.

583
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:33,030
Cloak and wings.

584
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,700
Mmm.

585
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,520
Dress and boots, too.

586
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:44,560
Coming.

587
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,060
Clock's ticking.

588
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:05,060
Let's get a good look.

589
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:10,290
Oh...

590
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,660
Lucky girl.

591
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:46,600
Serena.

592
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:51,570
Serena!

593
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:53,930
What did you do?

594
00:45:57,870 --> 00:45:59,500
Posture, dear.

595
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:03,450
Don't think about being clever.

596
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:06,470
There are consequences.

597
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,470
Hey. Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

598
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:26,040
Hey!

599
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,900
You gotta see this.

600
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,680
<i>We have
taken the extraordinary step</i>

601
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,940
<i>of addressing
the world directly.</i>

602
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:36,470
<i>We...</i>

603
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:38,840
<i>are a family in mourning.</i>

604
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,450
<i>A family devastated</i>

605
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:41,820
<i>by loss,</i>

606
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:43,250
<i>desperate for help</i>

607
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:44,420
<i>and answers.</i>

608
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,450
And we make this request

609
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:48,030
to the Canadian government

610
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:50,700
in peace.

611
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,270
Our beloved

612
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:54,040
baby daughter,

613
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,970
Nichole Waterford,

614
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:58,320
was kidnapped by
a dangerous fugitive

615
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,360
fleeing our country.

616
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:03,930
Nichole belongs in Gilead.

617
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:08,850
We miss her dearly.

618
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:10,890
We just want her back.

619
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:13,870
We expect

620
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:16,460
the government's
<i>full</i> cooperation,

621
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,860
as our daughter

622
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:21,360
is an innocent victim

623
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,390
with no voice of her own.

624
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:27,740
This is a family matter.

625
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:32,410
You can help to keep it this way

626
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:34,420
by sending her back to us...

627
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:37,310

1
00:00:04,613 --> 00:00:08,627
Okay, okay, please, please,
take your seats.

2
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,500
Leave your booklets closed

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,967
and your pencils down
until I tell you to begin.

4

5
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,299
Principal MacDonald?

6
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:46,697
Yeah, come on in.

7
00:00:48,604 --> 00:00:51,205
These are the exams from first period.

8
00:00:51,207 --> 00:00:54,041
Thanks, Lacey. Uh, any irregularities?

9
00:00:56,165 --> 00:00:57,611
What?

10
00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:00,481
Tyler Young.

11
00:01:00,483 --> 00:01:02,516
I got him admission and a scholarship

12
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:04,718
up at Hudson College next year.

13
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:08,322
It's contingent upon these scores, and...

14
00:01:08,324 --> 00:01:10,491
if he fails...

15
00:01:12,862 --> 00:01:16,351
Is there any way
I could look at his test?

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,768
By law... I have to certify

17
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,637
that I've locked these tests in a safe

18
00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:25,472
no later than ten minutes

19
00:01:25,474 --> 00:01:27,174
after the conclusion of the exam.

20
00:01:27,446 --> 00:01:29,109
No one can see them

21
00:01:29,111 --> 00:01:31,312
or touch them

22
00:01:31,314 --> 00:01:35,049
until the courier
from the testing service

23
00:01:35,051 --> 00:01:37,218
picks them up in the morning.

24
00:01:38,721 --> 00:01:40,888
But what happens

25
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,420
after I leave for the day...

26
00:01:44,727 --> 00:01:46,894
well, I wouldn't know about that.

27
00:02:09,952 --> 00:02:11,385
Can I help you?

28
00:02:17,126 --> 00:02:18,792
No.

29
00:02:21,631 --> 00:02:23,731
Yeah, um...

30
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:25,165
I need one test.

31
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:26,567
Tyler Young.

32
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:28,235
<i>I must say, Marissa,</i>

33
00:02:28,237 --> 00:02:30,137
you look absolutely beautiful.

34
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:31,972
But I'm sure Kyle's
already told you that.

35
00:02:31,974 --> 00:02:34,375
Yes. He told me I looked
beautiful in the shower.

36
00:02:34,377 --> 00:02:36,377
Told me I looked beautiful
in my underwear.

37
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:38,712
And then he told me
I looked beautiful in my dress.

38
00:02:38,714 --> 00:02:40,347
I couldn't help but notice his

39
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:42,650
sense of conviction diminishing
the more clothes I put on.

40
00:02:42,652 --> 00:02:44,318
Hmm, men. What's our problem?

41
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,686
Bull. Dr. Jason Bull.

42
00:02:45,688 --> 00:02:47,154
Why are we here again?

43
00:02:47,156 --> 00:02:49,490
I thought you swore last year
you were never coming back.

44
00:02:49,492 --> 00:02:51,425
And I meant it. Oh, wait a second.

45
00:02:51,427 --> 00:02:53,861
Is this the mayor's annual
"You Scratch My Back,

46
00:02:53,863 --> 00:02:56,563
I Have No Idea Who You Are
Fundraising Gala"?

47
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:58,751
Don't you think you've had enough?

48
00:02:58,753 --> 00:03:01,035
- Astonishingly, no.
- Come on, folks.

49
00:03:01,037 --> 00:03:03,504
- I can still hear this guy's voice.
- ...into our kids' college funds.

50
00:03:03,506 --> 00:03:06,040
Now here's a truly New York experience:

51
00:03:06,042 --> 00:03:08,676
a private carriage ride
through Central Park

52
00:03:08,678 --> 00:03:10,711
with Mayor Hopkins herself.

53
00:03:10,713 --> 00:03:12,446
What do you say we kick this one off

54
00:03:12,448 --> 00:03:13,814
at $2,000?

55
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,216
$2,000, anyone?

56
00:03:16,218 --> 00:03:17,484
Oh, God.

57
00:03:17,486 --> 00:03:19,186
Hey, what are you doing?
Someone's got to have $2,000.

58
00:03:19,188 --> 00:03:20,772
It's worth two grand to shut this guy up.

59
00:03:20,797 --> 00:03:21,989
It's practically a steal.

60
00:03:21,991 --> 00:03:23,357
$2,000, from the gentleman

61
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:26,260
- in the glasses. Now do I see three?
- Ta-da.

62
00:03:26,262 --> 00:03:27,728
- Auction over.
- $3,000?

63
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,296
$3,000, in the back.

64
00:03:29,298 --> 00:03:31,465
Now do I hear four?

65
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:33,534
Do I hear four? Do I hear four?

66
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:35,636
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I know when

67
00:03:35,638 --> 00:03:37,705
to bow out, I'm just
gonna run the price up.

68
00:03:37,707 --> 00:03:39,673
$4,000, from the man in the glasses.

69
00:03:39,675 --> 00:03:41,875
I can't believe this.

70
00:03:41,877 --> 00:03:43,944
$5,000 in the back, now. Do I hear six?

71
00:03:43,946 --> 00:03:45,212
We've got six.

72
00:03:45,214 --> 00:03:46,747
Thank you, Clark Kent.

73
00:03:46,749 --> 00:03:48,983
Is there a seven to be had?

74
00:03:48,985 --> 00:03:50,504
Do I hear seven?

75
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:52,353
Seven. Do I hear eight? $8,000?

76
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:54,822
- Bull, stop.
- Trust me, I know when to get out.

77
00:03:54,824 --> 00:03:56,623
- This is my last bid.
- Eight, anyone? $8,000!

78
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:59,860
Can I get nine? In the back.

79
00:03:59,862 --> 00:04:02,696
$9,000. $9,000 once,

80
00:04:02,698 --> 00:04:07,067
$9,000 twice, sold to the man in the back

81
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:07,968
for $9,000.

82
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,536
See?

83
00:04:09,538 --> 00:04:12,006
Do I know what I know
or do I know what I know?

84
00:04:12,008 --> 00:04:14,108
I don't know.

85
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,346
Ladies and gentlemen,
Your Honor the mayor

86
00:04:19,348 --> 00:04:21,949
was so moved by this
outpouring of generosity

87
00:04:21,951 --> 00:04:24,985
that she has agreed to take time for two

88
00:04:24,987 --> 00:04:26,387
carriage rides.

89
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:28,822
One to the man in the back for $9,000,

90
00:04:28,824 --> 00:04:31,392
and to the gentleman
in the glasses for eight.

91
00:04:31,394 --> 00:04:34,561
Oh, yeah...

92
00:04:36,966 --> 00:04:38,799
Dr. Bull.

93
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:41,802
Dr. Jason Bull?

94
00:04:41,804 --> 00:04:43,037
Dr. Bull?

95
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:45,372
John Powers. Chief of staff
for Mayor Hopkins.

96
00:04:45,374 --> 00:04:47,141
Thanks so much for jumping in out there.

97
00:04:47,143 --> 00:04:49,109
Page Six would've had
a field day if we couldn't

98
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:51,078
sell a stroll through the park
with Her Honor.

99
00:04:52,048 --> 00:04:53,514
Happy to do it. In fact,

100
00:04:53,516 --> 00:04:55,416
nothing gives me greater
pleasure than writing a check

101
00:04:55,418 --> 00:04:57,384
for something I really don't need.

102
00:04:59,288 --> 00:05:01,622
Truth is, I was wondering

103
00:05:01,624 --> 00:05:03,891
if I could impose on you for, uh,

104
00:05:03,893 --> 00:05:04,992
one more thing? You've heard about

105
00:05:04,994 --> 00:05:07,327
the cheating scandal in the Bronx?

106
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:10,738
Oh, yeah, last summer...
the teachers fixing tests?

107
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,267
The, uh, teachers union
is representing the only teacher

108
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:14,768
who's been charged so far.

109
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,438
She's a passionate young
educator, who, in our opinion,

110
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,840
is being railroaded by the
district attorney's office.

111
00:05:19,842 --> 00:05:23,177
Any way I could entice you
to take a meeting

112
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:24,745
with the teacher and her lawyer?

113
00:05:24,747 --> 00:05:27,181
The mayor would be extremely
grateful for your help.

114
00:05:27,183 --> 00:05:29,316
I'm sure she would.
There are far more teachers

115
00:05:29,318 --> 00:05:31,852
who vote in elections
than district attorneys.

116
00:05:33,956 --> 00:05:36,290
Just e-mail me where to go
and when to be there.

117
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:38,759
Um, and say hi to the mayor for me.

118
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:41,228
Even though she probably
couldn't tell me from Adam.

119
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,097
Uh, just say yes, Bull.

120
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:44,494
Yes, Bull.

121
00:05:45,454 --> 00:05:47,401
Dr. Jason Bull?

122
00:05:50,606 --> 00:05:51,839
<i>So, what can I do</i>

123
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:53,774
for you, Dr. Bull? Mayor's office said

124
00:05:53,776 --> 00:05:55,547
you'd be stopping by.

125
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,745
You know who I am?

126
00:05:58,747 --> 00:06:00,380
I read <i>The New York Times.</i>

127
00:06:00,382 --> 00:06:02,583
You're a trial scientist.

128
00:06:02,585 --> 00:06:04,118
It's hard to tell...
the way you said that...

129
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,285
just how you feel about it.

130
00:06:05,682 --> 00:06:07,421
Does the expression "third teat"

131
00:06:07,423 --> 00:06:08,622
clear it up for you?

132
00:06:08,624 --> 00:06:10,624
Mmm.

133
00:06:10,626 --> 00:06:12,397
It's open.

134
00:06:14,964 --> 00:06:18,098
Hi. Um... am I interrupting something?

135
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,433
I was told to just knock.

136
00:06:19,435 --> 00:06:21,401
No, no. You're fine.

137
00:06:21,403 --> 00:06:24,271
Lacey Adams, Dr. Jason Bull.

138
00:06:24,743 --> 00:06:25,939
Doctor.

139
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:27,641
Ms. Adams. It's nice to meet you.

140
00:06:27,643 --> 00:06:31,178
I'm a trial scientist.

141
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,280
I assist lawyers and legal teams

142
00:06:33,282 --> 00:06:34,648
with challenging cases.

143
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,283
The mayor's office wanted me to come by

144
00:06:36,285 --> 00:06:38,652
and meet you and your lawyer,

145
00:06:38,654 --> 00:06:40,454
see if I could be of any help.

146
00:06:40,456 --> 00:06:41,955
He can't.

147
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,725
Gwen here.

148
00:06:45,514 --> 00:06:46,793
Mm-hmm.

149
00:06:46,795 --> 00:06:48,962
Mm-hmm. Sure.

150
00:06:48,964 --> 00:06:50,364
So...

151
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:51,498
what'd they tell you

152
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,400
- about me?
- Nothing.

153
00:06:53,402 --> 00:06:55,435
I just know what I've read...
you and five other teachers

154
00:06:55,437 --> 00:06:58,672
are accused of altering more
than 800 standardized tests.

155
00:06:58,674 --> 00:07:00,774
I changed one answer...

156
00:07:00,776 --> 00:07:02,609
on one test.

157
00:07:02,948 --> 00:07:04,745
One.

158
00:07:04,747 --> 00:07:06,117
For one kid.

159
00:07:06,882 --> 00:07:09,216
Wow. That must be one special kid.

160
00:07:09,218 --> 00:07:10,784
He's one of those kids everyone says

161
00:07:10,786 --> 00:07:12,519
is a lost cause.

162
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:13,820
Terrible grades,

163
00:07:13,822 --> 00:07:15,377
attendance issues,

164
00:07:15,925 --> 00:07:17,191
no dad.

165
00:07:17,193 --> 00:07:20,011
And I think the mother
has a heroin problem.

166
00:07:20,596 --> 00:07:22,217
But in class?

167
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:24,498
I can see the gears turning.

168
00:07:24,886 --> 00:07:26,266
I spent three years working with him...

169
00:07:26,268 --> 00:07:27,634
before school,

170
00:07:27,636 --> 00:07:31,038
after school... I brought him up
from a D to a B-plus.

171
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:33,540
I even talked the admissions
counselor at Hudson College

172
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:34,741
into accepting him.

173
00:07:35,146 --> 00:07:37,911
All he had to do was
get a 65 on his test.

174
00:07:37,913 --> 00:07:41,882
And it shouldn't have
been a problem, but...

175
00:07:41,884 --> 00:07:43,584
So let me get this straight...

176
00:07:43,586 --> 00:07:45,185
they could place all six of you
at the scene,

177
00:07:45,187 --> 00:07:47,354
and all of you were arrested, but...

178
00:07:47,356 --> 00:07:49,289
you are the only one being charged.

179
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,857
- Mm-hmm.
- Why?

180
00:07:52,094 --> 00:07:55,029
Because I confessed.

181
00:07:57,266 --> 00:07:59,838
That was the district attorney's office.

182
00:08:00,102 --> 00:08:01,335
They're offering a deal.

183
00:08:01,337 --> 00:08:04,404
They certainly are. You plead guilty,

184
00:08:04,406 --> 00:08:06,773
testify against the other five teachers,

185
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:08,742
the ADA will give you probation.

186
00:08:08,744 --> 00:08:10,043
You'll serve no time.

187
00:08:10,045 --> 00:08:12,145
But she'll still have
a felony on her record.

188
00:08:12,147 --> 00:08:14,948
Which means they'll take away
your teaching license.

189
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,550
What's the alternative?

190
00:08:16,552 --> 00:08:18,719
- You go to jail.
- The alternative

191
00:08:18,721 --> 00:08:20,420
is we go to court.

192
00:08:20,422 --> 00:08:22,289
We explain to a jury why you did

193
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,524
what you did, and maybe, just maybe,

194
00:08:24,526 --> 00:08:26,960
you walk away from this, doing what

195
00:08:26,962 --> 00:08:28,328
you're meant to do.

196
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,285
Which is obviously teach.

197
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:32,366
And you'll be there?

198
00:08:32,368 --> 00:08:34,201
Part of the team?

199
00:08:34,203 --> 00:08:35,540
Absolutely.

200
00:08:36,171 --> 00:08:38,105
Can't have too many teats.

201
00:08:38,107 --> 00:08:39,806
Can you, Gwen?

202
00:08:42,578 --> 00:08:44,444
- What?
- Nothing.

203

Lacey Adams, age 27. Graduated from Yale,

205
00:08:59,464 --> 00:09:01,364
did a one-year stint
with Teach for America.

206
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:03,533
She has been at Woodrow
High School, in the Bronx,

207
00:09:03,535 --> 00:09:04,834
for the last three years.

208
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,803
Went to Yale and works in a public school

209
00:09:06,805 --> 00:09:08,083
in the Bronx; that's commitment.

210
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:09,873
Oh, it gets better. She works

211
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,375
11-hour days, nets less than $700 a week,

212
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:15,211
and buys school supplies
with her own money.

213
00:09:15,213 --> 00:09:17,981
I need to leave now so I can go
home and rethink my entire life.

214
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:19,415
A group of teachers

215
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:23,219
changes thousands of answers
on hundreds of tests.

216
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:25,688
And supposedly this girl
only did it once.

217
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,623
That's what she says.

218
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:27,724
Uh-huh.

219
00:09:27,726 --> 00:09:30,260
- And we believe her?
- Bull believes her.

220
00:09:30,262 --> 00:09:32,595
He thinks she's a good teacher.
He thinks she's a good person.

221
00:09:32,597 --> 00:09:34,497
And he hates that she's
facing a decade in prison.

222
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,566
He said,

223
00:09:36,568 --> 00:09:39,002
"In Lacey's mind, what
she did was justified.

224
00:09:39,004 --> 00:09:42,071
We just have to get the jurors
to accept that justification."

225
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,174
Well, that's all, huh?

226
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:51,748
You grew up around here?

227
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:54,083
Uh, I grew up in Switzerland.

228
00:09:54,085 --> 00:09:56,252
Ah, I was close.

229
00:09:56,254 --> 00:09:58,288
My father works in international finance.

230
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,490
Uh, they live in Massachusetts now.

231
00:10:00,492 --> 00:10:02,058
I mean, I am American.

232
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,359
I was born here.

233
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:04,994
But it wasn't until I went to Yale

234
00:10:04,996 --> 00:10:07,697
that I fell in love with the place.

235
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:09,467
What about teaching?

236
00:10:09,768 --> 00:10:11,134
Did you get the notice?

237
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:12,902
There's no money in it, Lacey.

238
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,437
Yeah, I know.

239
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:16,973
But, um, some of the most
important people in my life,

240
00:10:16,975 --> 00:10:19,978
growing up, were teachers.

241
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:23,479
I remember when we moved to Europe.

242
00:10:23,481 --> 00:10:25,400
I was five years old.

243
00:10:26,317 --> 00:10:28,985
They speak four languages in Switzerland.

244
00:10:29,487 --> 00:10:31,020
None of them English.

245
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:33,156
So the only person who understood me

246
00:10:33,158 --> 00:10:34,857
and the only person I could talk to,

247
00:10:34,859 --> 00:10:38,361
other than my mom and dad,
was my teacher.

248
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,297
My fate was sealed.

249
00:10:44,536 --> 00:10:47,337
I'm in a lot of trouble,
aren't I, Dr. Bull?

250
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:48,605
Yes.

251
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,673
And no.

252
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:52,609
I mean, you did do something
that was wrong.

253
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:54,844
But it seems fairly obvious

254
00:10:54,846 --> 00:10:57,098
you did it for a very good reason.

255
00:10:57,766 --> 00:10:59,282
In fact, it seems pretty clear

256
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,227
you did it to help someone else.

257
00:11:08,593 --> 00:11:11,394
God, I miss it.

258
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,533
God, I miss them.

259
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,121
I know.

260
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,639
Knock, knock.

261
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,241
How do you feel about necessity?

262
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:27,710
I feel very strongly

263
00:11:27,712 --> 00:11:30,013
that it's the mother of invention.

264
00:11:30,015 --> 00:11:33,082
Ah. I mean as a trial strategy.

265
00:11:33,084 --> 00:11:34,917
I just spent the morning
with our mutual client

266
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:36,753
and I think necessity
gives us what we need.

267
00:11:36,755 --> 00:11:40,223
You want to present a necessity defense?

268
00:11:40,225 --> 00:11:41,518
I do.

269
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,603
Think about it.

270
00:11:43,928 --> 00:11:46,195
We're stuck with Lacey's confession.

271
00:11:46,197 --> 00:11:48,898
I mean, we can't claim she's not guilty.

272
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:53,102
But we can turn a weakness
into a strength.

273
00:11:53,104 --> 00:11:57,006
We can demonstrate that Lacey's
cheating was a necessity.

274
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,374
She did it to prevent Tyler's life

275
00:11:58,376 --> 00:12:01,010
from becoming a greater tragedy
than it already was.

276
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,178
Okay.

277
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,180
Dr. Bull, I know you're not a lawyer,

278
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,883
but the necessity defense is intended

279
00:12:06,885 --> 00:12:09,018
for people trying to save lives.

280
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,119
That's what Lacey was doing.

281
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:11,321
An intruder breaks into your home

282
00:12:11,323 --> 00:12:13,222
and tries to kidnap your child,

283
00:12:13,224 --> 00:12:14,657
so you shoot him.

284
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:16,059
That's necessity.

285
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:19,362
That's why people mount
a necessity defense.

286
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,832
It's not used to defend against
an allegation of fraud.

287
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:24,434
And there's no precedent.

288
00:12:24,436 --> 00:12:26,035
Then let's make some precedent.

289
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,904
- You're serious.
- Mmm.

290
00:12:27,906 --> 00:12:30,473
Well, that's all well and good,

291
00:12:30,475 --> 00:12:32,442
but I've already decided.

292
00:12:32,444 --> 00:12:34,977
We're going to argue that
standardized testing

293
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:37,547
without regard to
socioeconomic inequality

294
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:39,716
is just bad public policy.

295
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:41,050
That's our defense.

296
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,819
I want to put the entire notion

297
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:44,220
of standardized testing

298
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,755
on trial.

299
00:12:45,757 --> 00:12:47,690
- You do?
- Damn right.

300
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:49,692
You ever get out of here?

301
00:12:49,694 --> 00:12:52,505
From under this mountain of paperwork?

302
00:12:53,756 --> 00:12:55,098
Why don't you come by my office?

303
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,799
I'll show you what we do,

304
00:12:56,801 --> 00:13:00,236
and why I think our defense
is such a winner.

305
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,405
<i>The jurors we should be looking for</i>

306
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,682
are those who understand

307
00:13:03,684 --> 00:13:06,843
it's sometimes acceptable
to do something wrong

308
00:13:06,845 --> 00:13:08,811
in pursuit of something right.

309
00:13:08,813 --> 00:13:11,180
You're talking about Machiavellianism,

310
00:13:11,182 --> 00:13:13,483
as in Niccolo Machiavelli?

311
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:14,717
Exactly.

312
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:17,019
Machiavelli, 15th century

313
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:19,856
politician and philosopher,
who believed it was absolutely

314
00:13:19,858 --> 00:13:23,726
fine to do the wrong thing, if
it was for the right reasons.

315
00:13:26,164 --> 00:13:29,332
Our task is to identify the jurors

316
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:31,768
with the most Machiavellian tendencies

317
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:34,504
and get them seated on that jury.

318
00:13:34,506 --> 00:13:36,572
Our task is to prove Lacey

319
00:13:36,574 --> 00:13:38,741
was put in an impossible situation

320
00:13:38,743 --> 00:13:40,910
by forces beyond her control,

321
00:13:40,912 --> 00:13:43,012
and did her best to navigate it.

322
00:13:43,014 --> 00:13:44,847
The rest of this is...

323
00:13:44,849 --> 00:13:47,350
Wait a minute. Is this a test?

324
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,221
It's the Mach IV test
for Machiavellianism.

325
00:13:52,223 --> 00:13:54,590
"Agree or disagree?

326
00:13:54,592 --> 00:13:57,794
Honesty is the best policy in all cases."

327
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:59,595
Mmm, I certainly agree with that.

328
00:13:59,597 --> 00:14:00,830
I don't.

329
00:14:00,832 --> 00:14:02,198
I don't believe you do either.

330
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,749
Kids, no fighting at the table.

331
00:14:03,751 --> 00:14:05,401
We have a guest.

332
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:30,560
Everybody ready to share?

333
00:14:30,562 --> 00:14:35,998
Remember, the higher the score,
the more Machiavellian you are.

334
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,067
Well, I got a 44.

335
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:39,569
Confirms what we already know.

336
00:14:39,571 --> 00:14:43,272
Save for your perverse talent
for violating people's privacy,

337
00:14:43,274 --> 00:14:45,174
and reading their most secret

338
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,777
and intimate documents online,
you're fundamentally

339
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:48,978
trustworthy and ethical.

340
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,547
I hate that. Sounds so boring.

341
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:55,486
- I got a 66.
- Spoken like a true Machiavellian.

342
00:14:55,488 --> 00:14:57,954
And right up there with my 72.

343
00:14:57,956 --> 00:14:59,889
- What'd you get?
- Uh, 62.

344
00:14:59,891 --> 00:15:02,725
- I guess we are a den of thieves.
- Hmm.

345
00:15:03,428 --> 00:15:06,629
And Mr. "Honesty is the best policy"?

346
00:15:06,631 --> 00:15:10,500
77. I'm not sure I even trust this test.

347
00:15:10,502 --> 00:15:12,869
38. And I trust it completely.

348
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,070
Ms. Kinsey?

349
00:15:14,072 --> 00:15:17,507
34. Not that it matters.

350
00:15:18,776 --> 00:15:20,320
Well done, group.

351
00:15:20,812 --> 00:15:22,912
Is anyone else hungry?

352
00:15:22,914 --> 00:15:24,240
Yeah.

353
00:15:43,868 --> 00:15:47,470
Here are the questions I'd love
you to ask potential jurors.

354
00:15:47,472 --> 00:15:49,438
In addition, it's extremely important

355
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,973
that you weave the word "necessity"

356
00:15:50,975 --> 00:15:53,543
into the conversation. I want the jurors

357
00:15:53,545 --> 00:15:55,211
to become very comfortable with that word

358
00:15:55,213 --> 00:15:57,079
and to start understanding
that that's what they need

359
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,848
to measure Lacey's behavior against.

360
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,184
Do me a favor and raise your hand

361
00:16:02,186 --> 00:16:04,353
if you agree with the following:

362
00:16:04,355 --> 00:16:07,823
"Most people are basically
good and kind."

363
00:16:12,497 --> 00:16:16,866
The defense would like to excuse
and thank jurors two and nine.

364
00:16:16,868 --> 00:16:19,235
"The best way to handle people

365
00:16:19,237 --> 00:16:20,937
is to tell them what they want to hear."

366
00:16:24,976 --> 00:16:28,277
Juror number five is acceptable
to the defense, Your Honor.

367
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,613
Necessity.

368
00:16:31,516 --> 00:16:34,450
Again, raise your hand if you agree.

369
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,053
"Generally speaking,
most people won't work hard

370
00:16:37,055 --> 00:16:39,655
unless it's an absolute necessity."

371
00:16:41,926 --> 00:16:45,695
Juror 12 is acceptable
to the defense, Your Honor.

372
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:48,264
Raise your hand if you believe

373
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:51,467
there should be uniform
educational standards

374
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,469
whether you live in Alaska or Wyoming,

375
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,972
whether your child is rich or poor.

376
00:16:56,674 --> 00:16:58,374
She's going off script.

377
00:16:58,376 --> 00:17:00,409
So, then, I take it
you believe standardized tests

378
00:17:00,411 --> 00:17:02,945
are a necessary part of the curriculum?

379
00:17:02,947 --> 00:17:04,246
I do.

380
00:17:04,248 --> 00:17:06,015
Defense would like to thank
and excuse this juror.

381
00:17:07,418 --> 00:17:09,185
So ordered. And let me remind the defense

382
00:17:09,187 --> 00:17:11,420
that you have now exhausted
all your challenges.

383
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:18,628
Mm.

384
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,497
What? I said the word "necessity."

385
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,065
You're not happy?

386
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:24,667
I thought we had a plan.

387
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,535
I thought we were working together.

388
00:17:26,537 --> 00:17:27,970
No.

389
00:17:27,972 --> 00:17:29,405
You had a plan.

390
00:17:29,407 --> 00:17:31,741
And you thought I was working for you.

391
00:17:31,743 --> 00:17:33,828
And now you know better.

392
00:17:37,582 --> 00:17:40,583
Rather Machiavellian, wouldn't you say?

393
00:18:10,426 --> 00:18:14,161
Tell me you are not going
through my personal papers.

394
00:18:16,932 --> 00:18:18,565
Sorry, can't do that.

395
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:19,753
That's exactly what I'm doing.

396
00:18:19,755 --> 00:18:21,568
Okay, I need you to stop right now.

397
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,737
I need you to get up,
get your clothes and leave.

398
00:18:23,739 --> 00:18:25,939
Are you mad at me?

399
00:18:25,941 --> 00:18:27,474
I am going to count to three,

400
00:18:27,476 --> 00:18:29,376
and if you are not out of that chair

401
00:18:29,378 --> 00:18:31,244
and getting your clothes,
I'm calling the police.

402
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,596
Out of the chair.

403
00:18:34,383 --> 00:18:36,516
But I was just looking through this stuff

404
00:18:36,518 --> 00:18:38,518
because I'm worried about you.

405
00:18:38,854 --> 00:18:41,121
Marissa... I'm a money guy.

406
00:18:41,123 --> 00:18:42,956
That's what I do.

407
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,158
And, uh, you won't let
me take care of you.

408
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,095
Half the time, you won't let me
pay for dinner, and I get it.

409
00:18:48,097 --> 00:18:49,496
That's what works for you,

410
00:18:49,498 --> 00:18:52,933
but I am who I am and I need
to know you're okay.

411
00:18:52,935 --> 00:18:55,936
That you're set for the future,
and you're not.

412
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:57,912
That's my business.

413
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,040
You're halfway through your working life

414
00:19:00,042 --> 00:19:01,958
and you have nothing put away.

415
00:19:02,277 --> 00:19:03,876
Less than a hundred grand.

416
00:19:04,446 --> 00:19:07,114
And I know, I see, that you're
paying for your mom

417
00:19:07,116 --> 00:19:10,350
to live in that nice place
in Massachusetts.

418
00:19:10,352 --> 00:19:12,385
You've got this great apartment.

419
00:19:12,387 --> 00:19:14,054
You're running some credit card debt.

420
00:19:14,056 --> 00:19:15,125
I need you to leave.

421
00:19:15,127 --> 00:19:16,824
I will leave in two minutes.

422
00:19:16,826 --> 00:19:19,475
I just, I want you to know...

423
00:19:20,062 --> 00:19:23,597
I can make room for you
in my Queens project.

424
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:27,264
Push some of the Chinese money
aside and make room for you.

425
00:19:27,264 --> 00:19:30,498
Take your 75 grand and turn
it into 350 in 18 months.

426
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:33,184
And it would give me

427
00:19:33,186 --> 00:19:35,491
enormous pleasure to do that, it would.

428
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:39,274
'Cause I care about you.

429
00:19:51,388 --> 00:19:52,721
Wow.

430
00:19:53,634 --> 00:19:55,924
This is impressive.

431
00:19:55,926 --> 00:19:58,693
I didn't know something
like this even existed.

432
00:19:58,695 --> 00:20:01,726
I'm very proud of this.

433
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:06,701
By the way, we finally
made contact with Tyler.

434
00:20:07,398 --> 00:20:08,770
Turns out he is the prosecution's

435
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:10,739
first witness tomorrow.

436
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:12,140
He's coming in tonight to get prepped.

437
00:20:12,142 --> 00:20:14,075
That's great.

438
00:20:14,077 --> 00:20:16,544
Um, how is he?

439
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:17,879
Um, is he okay?

440
00:20:17,881 --> 00:20:19,381
Did he get some kind of job?

441
00:20:19,383 --> 00:20:20,782
I mean, I feel terrible

442
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:23,051
that I'm putting him
through all this trouble.

443
00:20:23,053 --> 00:20:24,819
That's funny. He was worried about you.

444
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,023
He said if he, uh, had done better

445
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:30,458
on the test, none of this
would have happened.

446
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,993
So...

447
00:20:31,995 --> 00:20:33,762
you mind if I ask you a question?

448
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:36,932
You can ask me any question
you'd like, Dr. Bull.

449
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:38,867
You come from money.

450
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:41,803
Is that a question or an accusation?

451
00:20:41,805 --> 00:20:43,705
Just a fact.

452
00:20:44,518 --> 00:20:46,474
It makes your choice of
profession even more laudable,

453
00:20:46,476 --> 00:20:49,044
but it does beg the question...

454
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:51,579
why do you have a union lawyer?

455
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,915
Hmm? Why aren't you being represented

456
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:55,884
by some high-priced firm

457
00:20:55,886 --> 00:20:58,720
that has the DA's
private cell phone number

458
00:20:58,722 --> 00:21:01,723
and can maybe make this
whole thing go away?

459
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,287
Are your parents unwilling to help you?

460
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:08,123
Do they understand...
do you understand...

461
00:21:08,542 --> 00:21:10,458
you could go to prison for ten years?

462
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,761
The ADA is looking to make
an example out of you

463
00:21:12,763 --> 00:21:15,263
and those five other teachers.

464
00:21:15,265 --> 00:21:17,799
He is not fooling around.

465
00:21:19,637 --> 00:21:21,269
My parents didn't walk into that room

466
00:21:21,271 --> 00:21:23,171
and change the test question.

467
00:21:23,591 --> 00:21:24,639
I did.

468
00:21:24,641 --> 00:21:25,974
And I'm sure you won't
be surprised to hear

469
00:21:25,976 --> 00:21:27,242
that they were not too thrilled

470
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,978
at the idea of me becoming a teacher.

471
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:31,947
A public school teacher...

472
00:21:31,949 --> 00:21:34,883
in New York, in the Bronx.

473
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,620
I'm an adult, Dr. Bull.

474
00:21:38,622 --> 00:21:41,022
I make my own choices, I pay my own way,

475
00:21:41,024 --> 00:21:43,285
and I'm willing to pay
for the consequences.

476
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:45,560
I meant what I said

477
00:21:45,562 --> 00:21:47,957
when I told you I was
grateful for your help.

478
00:21:48,632 --> 00:21:53,468
But I understand if you feel
that this is a fool's errand.

479
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,089
Not at all.

480
00:21:56,132 --> 00:21:57,205
I'm just trying to figure out

481
00:21:57,207 --> 00:21:59,574
if you're a saint or
a misbegotten martyr.

482
00:22:05,148 --> 00:22:06,848
<i>Mr. Young.</i>

483
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,750
What did you offer to do in return

484
00:22:08,752 --> 00:22:11,188
for Ms. Adams changing your test grade?

485
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,221
I didn't offer to do anything.

486
00:22:13,223 --> 00:22:14,856
I didn't even know she was gonna do it.

487
00:22:14,858 --> 00:22:17,125
She didn't even tell me she
was gonna change that answer.

488
00:22:17,611 --> 00:22:19,628
I didn't even find out
until she got arrested

489
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,696
and the school called to tell me
my scholarship was no good,

490
00:22:21,698 --> 00:22:23,732
and that I couldn't go there anymore.

491
00:22:23,734 --> 00:22:26,067
And when that happened, were you mad?

492
00:22:26,069 --> 00:22:27,235
I was really...

493
00:22:27,237 --> 00:22:28,603
confused.

494
00:22:29,123 --> 00:22:31,206
Never mad. Sad.

495
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,708
'Cause I had it all in my
head, going to college.

496
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,377
No one in my family's
ever been to college.

497
00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:36,578
I don't even think I know anybody

498
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,612
who's ever been to college.

499
00:22:37,614 --> 00:22:39,347
So I was really sad, but also worried.

500
00:22:39,349 --> 00:22:42,284
Because I thought Ms. Adams
got in a lot of trouble,

501
00:22:42,286 --> 00:22:43,652
and I keep kind of thinking
it's my fault...

502
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:46,788
That's a lot of words, Tyler.
Remember what I said before?

503
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,790
Right.

504
00:22:49,477 --> 00:22:50,825
Just answer the question.

505
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,093
Right.

506
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:53,862
So try it again.

507
00:22:54,231 --> 00:22:57,432
When you found out what
she had done, were you mad?

508
00:22:57,434 --> 00:22:59,234
No, sir, I wasn't mad.

509
00:23:00,404 --> 00:23:01,803
You like Ms. Adams, don't you?

510
00:23:03,407 --> 00:23:05,373
I think she's a really good teacher.

511
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:06,875
Nice answer.

512
00:23:06,877 --> 00:23:09,644
Do you think she... liked you?

513
00:23:10,664 --> 00:23:12,447
I think you'd have to ask her that.

514
00:23:13,283 --> 00:23:14,949
Good answer.

515
00:23:14,951 --> 00:23:18,520
Do you think the reason
why she did what she did for you

516
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,721
and the reason you weren't mad

517
00:23:19,723 --> 00:23:22,290
is because the two of you
liked each other?

518
00:23:24,178 --> 00:23:25,593
No. Don't just stare at me.

519
00:23:25,595 --> 00:23:28,396
That-that looks like a yes to the jury.

520
00:23:28,398 --> 00:23:30,131
- But it's not.
- So,

521
00:23:30,133 --> 00:23:31,933
what do you say?

522
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,805
Sir, I'm happy to answer
any questions you have

523
00:23:36,807 --> 00:23:38,606
about the facts of the case.

524
00:23:39,193 --> 00:23:40,909
But now you're just making stuff up.

525
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:42,477
I don't have to answer any questions

526
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:44,579
about things you make up.

527
00:23:45,866 --> 00:23:47,849
Nice answer.

528
00:23:47,851 --> 00:23:50,318
I think you're gonna do great.

529
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,420
Tyler, when you started tenth grade,

530
00:23:52,422 --> 00:23:54,189
what was your letter grade average?

531
00:23:54,191 --> 00:23:55,757
A "C" or a "D," I think.

532
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:58,526
According to your school
records, it was a C-minus.

533
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:02,430
But by your senior year,
your average soared to a B-plus.

534
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,567
Any idea what happened in
those three years to make

535
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,470
such a dramatic difference
in your grades?

536
00:24:08,764 --> 00:24:11,787
Well, I think a big part of it
was Ms. Adams.

537
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:13,808
She spent a lot of time tutoring me.

538
00:24:14,478 --> 00:24:15,577
Simple as that, huh?

539
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,245
Just spend some time with your teacher

540
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,314
and you get right on the honor roll.

541
00:24:19,316 --> 00:24:20,949
Objection. Argumentative.

542
00:24:20,951 --> 00:24:23,017
- Ask a question, Mr. Newhall.
- Sure.

543
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:25,765
Here's a question.
How do we know the defendant

544
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:27,055
wasn't changing your test scores

545
00:24:27,057 --> 00:24:28,990
starting<i> all</i> the way
back in the tenth grade?

546
00:24:28,992 --> 00:24:32,127
How do we know she hasn't been
cheating for you all along?

547
00:24:32,129 --> 00:24:34,129
Objection. Calls for speculation.

548
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:36,331
Assumes facts not in evidence.

549
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:37,999
- Sustained.
- Okay.

550
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:40,535
Let me ask it another way.

551
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,604
Are you certain your teacher

552
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,639
hasn't been cheating for you

553
00:24:44,641 --> 00:24:46,039
these last three years?

554
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:47,709
- Yes.
- Really?

555
00:24:47,711 --> 00:24:48,810
How can you be so sure?

556
00:24:48,812 --> 00:24:50,178
I mean, it's possible,

557
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,413
- isn't it?
- Objection!

558
00:24:51,415 --> 00:24:53,515
- Anything is possible!
- Exactly!

559
00:24:53,517 --> 00:24:54,682
So how many tests

560
00:24:54,684 --> 00:24:57,085
did she<i> really</i> help you with? Ten?

561
00:24:57,087 --> 00:24:58,720
I don't have to
answer questions about things

562
00:24:58,722 --> 00:24:59,651
you make up. I don't have

563
00:24:59,676 --> 00:25:00,608
- 20?
- to answer questions...

564
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,556
- ...about things you make up.
- 30?

565
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:04,058
- I don't have to answer questions...
- I told you, one.

566
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,528
One? Really?

567
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,062
How can you be so sure?

568
00:25:08,064 --> 00:25:10,131
Objection! He's
badgering the witness. Please.

569
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,433
The truth is, you can't,

570
00:25:11,435 --> 00:25:13,067
can you? You don't know.

571
00:25:13,069 --> 00:25:14,736
You have no idea.

572
00:25:14,738 --> 00:25:16,738
You're right.

573
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,873
I have no idea. I don't know.

574
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:21,276
I don't. I don't know.
What do you want me to say?

575
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:22,410
Just stop talking. I don't.

576
00:25:22,412 --> 00:25:23,845
- Don't say anything.
- I don't know.

577
00:25:23,847 --> 00:25:24,846
Objection is sustained.

578
00:25:24,848 --> 00:25:26,147
I'm sorry, Bull.

579
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,849
I really did try to prep him.

580
00:25:34,322 --> 00:25:36,458
That drink better be for me.

581
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:39,427
Sorry, this one's spoken for.

582
00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:41,663
You upset about the trial?

583
00:25:41,982 --> 00:25:44,532
No, it's only just begun.

584
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,806
That was a serious swallow.

585
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,143
Want to tell your Uncle Bull
all about it?

586
00:25:57,498 --> 00:25:58,813
What is it about what we do

587
00:25:58,815 --> 00:26:01,583
- that makes it so hard to trust people?
- Oh.

588
00:26:01,585 --> 00:26:02,750
Hmm.

589
00:26:02,752 --> 00:26:04,586
We're gonna have that conversation?

590
00:26:05,547 --> 00:26:07,989
Marissa, give yourself a break.

591
00:26:07,991 --> 00:26:10,325
We spend the whole day figuring out

592
00:26:10,327 --> 00:26:12,293
if people are lying to us or not.

593
00:26:12,295 --> 00:26:14,796
And when we're not doing that,
we're figuring out

594
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:16,464
how to convince 12 strangers

595
00:26:16,466 --> 00:26:18,978
that our clients are telling the truth.

596
00:26:19,728 --> 00:26:22,337
Of course we don't trust anybody.

597
00:26:24,358 --> 00:26:27,442
Kyle offered to do something
for me the other night.

598
00:26:27,778 --> 00:26:29,310
Something really nice.

599
00:26:29,312 --> 00:26:30,311
Really thoughtful.

600
00:26:30,313 --> 00:26:31,513
And what did you do?

601
00:26:32,366 --> 00:26:34,115
I threatened to have him arrested.

602
00:26:35,485 --> 00:26:37,519
Ain't love grand?

603
00:26:39,957 --> 00:26:42,326
I think I'm gonna go home
and call him and apologize.

604
00:26:42,328 --> 00:26:43,358
Oh.

605
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,894
Well, I'm glad
I could help you work through

606
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:47,495
this little crisis of the heart.

607
00:26:47,497 --> 00:26:50,465
Don't hesitate to call me
if you need any more ad...

608
00:26:58,201 --> 00:26:59,118
You're welcome.

609
00:27:00,195 --> 00:27:02,043
At the request
of the State Board of Education,

610
00:27:02,045 --> 00:27:03,745
I reviewed the tests.

611
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,013
And what did you find?

612
00:27:05,015 --> 00:27:08,016
They all shared a similar
pattern of eraser marks.

613
00:27:08,018 --> 00:27:10,100
- How do you mean?
- The vast majority

614
00:27:10,102 --> 00:27:14,355
were in the history section,
between questions 20 and 35.

615
00:27:14,658 --> 00:27:17,225
This is a copy of Tyler Young's test.

616
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:18,993
There are three erasure marks,

617
00:27:18,995 --> 00:27:21,829
one of which Ms. Adams admits to making.

618
00:27:21,831 --> 00:27:24,666
They are all wrong
to right answer changes.

619
00:27:24,668 --> 00:27:26,167
What number questions are those?

620
00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:29,504
11, 48, and 73.

621
00:27:29,506 --> 00:27:30,872
None are in the history section.

622
00:27:30,874 --> 00:27:31,991
- Correct.
- And none are

623
00:27:31,993 --> 00:27:33,207
in the question 20

624
00:27:33,209 --> 00:27:34,842
to question 35 range.

625
00:27:34,844 --> 00:27:35,810
Correct.

626
00:27:35,812 --> 00:27:37,045
Sounds like Tyler's test

627
00:27:37,047 --> 00:27:38,580
is very different from the others.

628
00:27:38,582 --> 00:27:40,348
Objection. Leading.

629
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,482
Sustained.

630
00:27:41,484 --> 00:27:42,684
I'll put it another way.

631
00:27:42,686 --> 00:27:45,420
The test Lacey admits to changing

632
00:27:45,422 --> 00:27:48,256
is different
from all the other 800 tests.

633
00:27:48,258 --> 00:27:50,658
It doesn't fit the pattern, right?

634
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,593
Right.

635
00:27:52,529 --> 00:27:54,228
Nothing further.

636
00:27:55,165 --> 00:27:57,098
Talk to me, Marissa. Well, yesterday was

637
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,967
a train wreck. No green
on the screens anywhere.

638
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:00,969
But today we have seven greens back,

639
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:02,637
three yellows, and two reds.

640
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,439
So even though the two of you
hate each other,

641
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:06,941
it seems like you're making progress.

642
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:09,210
Hmm.

643
00:28:09,671 --> 00:28:10,878
Hey, can I talk to you?

644
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,281
Talk fast. I got a car waiting.
What are you offering?

645
00:28:13,283 --> 00:28:15,016
What makes you think
I'm offering anything?

646
00:28:15,511 --> 00:28:17,652
'Cause it's my job to know
whether I'm winning or losing

647
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,753
and by how much.

648
00:28:18,755 --> 00:28:20,888
And right now, I'm winning. By a lot.

649
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,287
I'll drop the charges against Lacey.

650
00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:25,415
I'll even make sure she gets
her teaching credentials back.

651
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:26,828
And my boss will call
the dean of students

652
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,396
at Tyler's college, get him reinstated.

653
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:30,365
In exchange for...?

654
00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:32,533
I need those five other teachers.

655
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,970
I get it. Your client's
a nice lady who did

656
00:28:35,972 --> 00:28:37,605
a bad thing for a good reason.

657
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,140
But those other five...

658
00:28:39,142 --> 00:28:42,610
Come on. You're asking her
to decide between her colleagues

659
00:28:42,612 --> 00:28:44,812
- and her student.
- Her student

660
00:28:44,814 --> 00:28:46,080
and her career.

661
00:28:46,082 --> 00:28:49,350
Tyler can quit his dead-end job
and go to college.

662
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:52,453
And Lacey can get back in the classroom.

663
00:29:09,553 --> 00:29:10,886
Wow.

664
00:29:10,888 --> 00:29:15,757
So, is, um, this why
you wanted me here early?

665
00:29:16,147 --> 00:29:18,114
So you could triple-team me?

666
00:29:18,116 --> 00:29:19,382
It's a good deal,

667
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:20,716
Lacey.

668
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:23,052
I'd go so far as to say
it's a great deal.

669
00:29:23,054 --> 00:29:24,520
And I am not in the business

670
00:29:24,522 --> 00:29:26,722
of throwing other teachers to the wolves.

671
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:29,759
But I will be here for them,
just as I was for you.

672
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:32,728
It sounds like you've
already made up your mind.

673
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,164
You heard what I thought
when I called you last night.

674
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:36,866
Gets you everything you want.

675
00:29:36,868 --> 00:29:39,635
Tyler gets to go to college.
You get to continue teaching.

676
00:29:39,637 --> 00:29:41,637
And as for the other teachers,

677
00:29:41,639 --> 00:29:43,773
they get their day in
court, just like you did.

678
00:29:43,775 --> 00:29:45,474
My two cents... I worked

679
00:29:45,476 --> 00:29:47,476
in the DA's office a long time.

680
00:29:47,478 --> 00:29:49,812
Deals don't get much better than this.

681
00:29:51,683 --> 00:29:53,233
So it's unanimous.

682
00:29:53,651 --> 00:29:55,770
You want me to sell out
the people I work with.

683
00:29:55,772 --> 00:29:57,586
I wouldn't call it a sellout.

684
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:59,955
The ADA already knows who they are.

685
00:29:59,957 --> 00:30:01,891
He already knows what they did.

686
00:30:01,893 --> 00:30:03,257
But he can't prove it without me.

687
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,527
Today.

688
00:30:04,529 --> 00:30:06,295
But maybe tomorrow he can.

689
00:30:06,297 --> 00:30:09,065
And maybe tomorrow,
one of the five goes to him

690
00:30:09,067 --> 00:30:10,299
and cuts a deal.

691
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:13,302
And then you have nothing.

692
00:30:13,304 --> 00:30:15,371
Nothing but jail time.

693
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:17,740
It's your decision, Lacey.

694
00:30:17,742 --> 00:30:19,575
We just want you to
understand what's at stake.

695
00:30:19,577 --> 00:30:22,712
But whatever you decide,
we'll go along with it.

696
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:28,784
I want Tyler to go back to school.

697
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:32,655
And... I want to keep my job.

698
00:30:34,192 --> 00:30:36,258
But I couldn't live with myself knowing

699
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,820
I destroyed the lives of others
to make it happen.

700
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:42,164
You called it.

701
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:44,117
How did you describe her?

702
00:30:44,535 --> 00:30:47,269
- The architect of her own destiny.
- Mm.

703
00:30:49,413 --> 00:30:51,380
We are all here for you, Lacey.

704
00:30:51,576 --> 00:30:54,506
Now, I will call the ADA's office,

705
00:30:54,508 --> 00:30:56,612
let 'em know that you
have made your decision,

706
00:30:56,614 --> 00:30:59,915
and... we can plot our next move.

707
00:30:59,917 --> 00:31:01,385
You know what,

708
00:31:01,853 --> 00:31:04,387
I just plotted my next move.

709
00:31:04,389 --> 00:31:06,856
I'm withdrawing from the case.

710
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,893
Wait, you're what?

711
00:31:08,895 --> 00:31:12,328
Our union is happy to come
to the aid of our members

712
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:15,064
when they've been
wrongly accused of a crime.

713
00:31:15,066 --> 00:31:18,401
We're even happy to help when
they've admitted to a crime,

714
00:31:18,403 --> 00:31:21,237
when we think there are
extenuating circumstances

715
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:24,240
that will impact the lives
of working teachers.

716
00:31:24,242 --> 00:31:26,108
But I am not about

717
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,778
to spend our very limited time
and resources

718
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,999
on what I now realize
is a suicide mission.

719
00:31:32,884 --> 00:31:35,684
I'm sure Dr. Bull
can help you find someone

720
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:38,255
to get you through the remainder
of the trial.

721
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:45,387
I did not see that coming.

722
00:31:46,597 --> 00:31:48,531
Did I just make a huge mistake?

723
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:51,100
I actually think you traded up.

724
00:31:52,403 --> 00:31:54,570
Oh. Yeah.

725
00:31:54,572 --> 00:31:57,106
I bet you say that to all
the second-string lawyers.

726
00:31:58,643 --> 00:32:00,943
What's the game plan, Doc?

727
00:32:00,945 --> 00:32:03,679
Well, we have a little less than an hour

728
00:32:03,681 --> 00:32:06,081
to get young Ms. Adams ready.

729
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:08,017
For what?

730
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:09,786
We're putting you on the stand.

731
00:32:13,825 --> 00:32:16,659
Lacey, you already testified

732
00:32:16,661 --> 00:32:20,095
that the second you saw Tyler
the morning of the exam

733
00:32:20,422 --> 00:32:22,264
you knew that he was going to struggle.

734
00:32:22,266 --> 00:32:23,732
What was that based on?

735
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:26,635
Well, to begin with,
he was already a half hour late.

736
00:32:26,637 --> 00:32:30,318
But more than that, I know
how complicated his life is.

737
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,318
How do you mean?

738
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,641
Well, first of all,

739
00:32:32,643 --> 00:32:34,410
he's got a little brother
he's got to feed

740
00:32:34,412 --> 00:32:36,229
and get off to school every morning.

741
00:32:37,014 --> 00:32:41,250
Plus, his mother, um, has a drug problem,

742
00:32:41,252 --> 00:32:44,253
and sometimes she brings men
to the apartment

743
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:47,790
in the middle of the night
to, uh, support her drug habit.

744
00:32:47,792 --> 00:32:51,495
On these nights, I-I know
Tyler doesn't get any sleep.

745
00:32:52,163 --> 00:32:55,328
I'm fairly certain that's what
happened the day of the test.

746
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:57,633
Objection. Hearsay.

747
00:32:57,635 --> 00:32:58,634
Right on cue.

748
00:32:58,636 --> 00:33:00,402
It's not hearsay.

749
00:33:00,404 --> 00:33:02,638
During school vacations,
I would go to his apartment

750
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,741
and tutor him in the morning
and then again in the evening.

751
00:33:05,743 --> 00:33:07,910
I know what I'm talking about.

752
00:33:07,912 --> 00:33:09,002
I'm going to allow it.

753
00:33:09,004 --> 00:33:10,346
Thank you, Your Honor.

754
00:33:10,847 --> 00:33:12,643
So let me ask you a question.

755
00:33:15,686 --> 00:33:17,120
Was this your plan?

756
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:19,588
Tyler takes the test.

757
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,023
If he doesn't make the grade,

758
00:33:21,025 --> 00:33:23,325
you figure out a way
to doctor his answers?

759
00:33:23,327 --> 00:33:26,279
No. It didn't even cross my mind.

760
00:33:26,764 --> 00:33:28,721
Tyler is a solid "B" student.

761
00:33:28,723 --> 00:33:31,560
But that morning, you knew
he wasn't getting a "B."

762
00:33:31,562 --> 00:33:32,828
I didn't know...

763
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:35,938
but-but I sensed.

764
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,167
I just wanted to look at it, the test.

765
00:33:39,577 --> 00:33:41,110
That's all I really wanted to do,

766
00:33:41,112 --> 00:33:43,946
is just put my mind at ease
that he had passed,

767
00:33:43,948 --> 00:33:45,814
and that he'd be going to college.

768
00:33:46,049 --> 00:33:47,182
But then I walked in,

769
00:33:47,184 --> 00:33:49,666
and I realized that all I had
to do was change one question,

770
00:33:49,668 --> 00:33:51,548
and he could have a future.

771
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:53,556
You and Tyler prepped for the exam,

772
00:33:53,558 --> 00:33:54,757
is that correct?

773
00:33:55,142 --> 00:33:56,926
You gave him practice tests?

774
00:33:56,928 --> 00:33:58,327
Yes, three times.

775
00:33:58,329 --> 00:33:59,421
And how did he do?

776
00:33:59,423 --> 00:34:02,141
80s. Low 80s, every time.

777
00:34:02,143 --> 00:34:04,466
That's how I know him failing
is an anomaly.

778
00:34:04,468 --> 00:34:05,788
One last question.

779
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:08,637
If you could do anything
you wanted to in life...

780
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,641
okay, a-a-anything at all,
money's no object...

781
00:34:12,643 --> 00:34:14,076
what would that be?

782
00:34:14,078 --> 00:34:15,711
Objection. Relevance.

783
00:34:15,713 --> 00:34:17,122
Overruled.

784
00:34:21,272 --> 00:34:22,419
This.

785
00:34:23,007 --> 00:34:26,339
Uh, teaching, not testifying.

786
00:34:27,111 --> 00:34:30,078
Showing people who think they
know where their boundaries are

787
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,638
that there's so much more.

788
00:34:35,223 --> 00:34:38,220
No further questions, Your Honor.

789
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:42,491
Cross-examination.

790
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,733
One question.

791
00:34:45,663 --> 00:34:48,664
Did you or did you not change an answer

792
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:50,432
on Tyler Young's exam?

793
00:34:50,434 --> 00:34:51,900
Objection.

794
00:34:51,902 --> 00:34:53,735
Asked and answered, Your Honor.

795
00:34:54,075 --> 00:34:55,404
Overruled.

796
00:34:55,406 --> 00:34:57,537
Yes or no? I need to hear.

797
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,609
Did you alter, in any way,
Tyler Young's exam

798
00:35:00,611 --> 00:35:02,544
after it was completed?

799
00:35:02,546 --> 00:35:06,248
Making you guilty of tampering
with a government record.

800
00:35:07,751 --> 00:35:09,341
As well as perjury,

801
00:35:10,258 --> 00:35:13,255
since you warranted the results
by virtue of your role

802
00:35:13,257 --> 00:35:15,290
as the official proctor of record.

803
00:35:16,994 --> 00:35:18,475
And fraud...

804
00:35:19,196 --> 00:35:21,797
since your intent was to deceive.

805
00:35:24,814 --> 00:35:26,368
Yes or no.

806
00:35:27,738 --> 00:35:29,027
Yes.

807
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,240
Uh, yes, I did.

808
00:35:32,405 --> 00:35:34,243
No more questions.

809
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:50,163
Okay. How we doing
with closing arguments?

810
00:35:50,251 --> 00:35:52,121
- Uh...
- Not good.

811
00:35:52,123 --> 00:35:54,253
We've already run six different versions.

812
00:35:54,255 --> 00:35:56,355
Yeah, I just let the
last group of mock jurors go.

813
00:35:56,357 --> 00:35:58,324
We were just throwing away
good money after bad.

814
00:35:58,326 --> 00:36:00,276
I don't understand. What's the problem?

815
00:36:00,276 --> 00:36:02,142
The problem is she did it, Bull.

816
00:36:02,144 --> 00:36:03,544
That's always been a problem.

817
00:36:03,546 --> 00:36:05,813
They're just not buying
the necessity defense.

818
00:36:05,815 --> 00:36:07,881
They want more evidence
to support Lacey's choice.

819
00:36:07,883 --> 00:36:10,117
If you want to win an acquittal,

820
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:11,361
we need something tangible,

821
00:36:11,987 --> 00:36:14,755
something definitive,
something objective.

822
00:36:15,699 --> 00:36:17,357
Then that's what we'll give them.

823
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,693
You want the boy to take the test again?

824
00:36:19,695 --> 00:36:21,406
Here? Today?

825
00:36:21,408 --> 00:36:22,996
I have the testing service standing by

826
00:36:22,998 --> 00:36:24,431
with a fresh version of the exam.

827
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:26,166
And I am happy to have Your Honor,

828
00:36:26,168 --> 00:36:28,569
and the ADA here, proctor it,

829
00:36:28,571 --> 00:36:30,237
so everyone can be sure

830
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:31,805
that there's no funny business going on.

831
00:36:31,807 --> 00:36:33,407
Give him the test and two hours later,

832
00:36:33,409 --> 00:36:34,742
we will know where we stand.

833
00:36:34,744 --> 00:36:35,769
Your Honor,

834
00:36:35,771 --> 00:36:38,212
this is completely irrelevant
and unduly prejudicial,

835
00:36:38,214 --> 00:36:39,713
not to mention an obfuscation.

836
00:36:39,715 --> 00:36:42,316
Judge Conway, I disagree.

837
00:36:42,318 --> 00:36:44,952
Our client has never denied what she did.

838
00:36:44,954 --> 00:36:47,654
What's relevant here is why she did it.

839
00:36:50,294 --> 00:36:53,160
It's unorthodox,
but I agree it's relevant.

840
00:36:53,162 --> 00:36:54,862
And I'm going to allow it.

841
00:37:35,028 --> 00:37:37,437
In the 82nd percentile,

842
00:37:37,439 --> 00:37:38,782
ladies and gentlemen.

843
00:37:39,708 --> 00:37:41,975
That's what Tyler Young scored

844
00:37:41,977 --> 00:37:44,378
when he retook his
college placement exam.

845
00:37:44,746 --> 00:37:46,414
82%.

846
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:48,186
Now, why does that matter?

847
00:37:48,188 --> 00:37:50,484
Well, because it proves why Lacey felt

848
00:37:50,486 --> 00:37:52,152
what she did was necessary.

849
00:37:52,154 --> 00:37:54,188
Against the rules,

850
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,382
but necessary.

851
00:37:56,659 --> 00:38:00,060
She knew what her student was capable of,

852
00:38:00,062 --> 00:38:02,963
and didn't want that student's
future compromised

853
00:38:02,965 --> 00:38:05,642
because of circumstances
that were beyond his control.

854
00:38:07,102 --> 00:38:09,503
Lacey Adams confessed

855
00:38:09,505 --> 00:38:12,816
to changing a single answer,

856
00:38:13,409 --> 00:38:17,578
bringing Tyler's test
to the 65th percentile,

857
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:21,048
allowing him to attend a local college,

858
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:24,160
where he hoped to study architecture,

859
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,154
and perhaps be the first person
in his family

860
00:38:27,156 --> 00:38:29,122
to earn a college degree.

861
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:31,458
Is changing answers wrong?

862
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,129
Yes, absolutely.

863
00:38:34,663 --> 00:38:37,006
But is it, is it worse than...

864
00:38:37,799 --> 00:38:41,635
taking away a bright young man's
opportunity to better himself,

865
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:43,555
change his future?

866
00:38:44,597 --> 00:38:46,975
Well, I guess that's why you're here.

867
00:38:47,676 --> 00:38:51,945
I guess that's why we'll leave
it up to you to decide.

868
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:54,481
Thank you for listening.

869
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,781
Madam Foreman,
have you reached a verdict?

870
00:39:02,057 --> 00:39:03,825
Yes we have, Your Honor.

871
00:39:04,993 --> 00:39:06,994
We, the jury,

872
00:39:06,996 --> 00:39:10,597
find the defendant, Lacey Adams, guilty

873
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:14,201
on one count of tampering
with a government record,

874
00:39:14,203 --> 00:39:16,342
one count of perjury,

875
00:39:16,344 --> 00:39:18,705
and one count of fraud.

876
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:22,542
I'm sorry. I'm, uh...

877
00:39:22,544 --> 00:39:24,444
No. I did it.

878
00:39:24,804 --> 00:39:26,179
I did.

879
00:39:26,181 --> 00:39:27,481
Bull?

880
00:39:27,724 --> 00:39:29,267
Is she okay?

881
00:39:29,652 --> 00:39:31,019
Are-are you okay?

882
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:35,455
I am so, so sorry.

883
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:38,091
I'll fix this, I will.

884
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:41,321
Somehow, I promise.

885
00:39:47,535 --> 00:39:49,245
Okay.

886
00:39:55,168 --> 00:39:56,795
You're here.

887
00:39:57,146 --> 00:39:59,012
You actually showed up.

888
00:39:59,014 --> 00:40:01,882
Hey. You're not the mayor.

889
00:40:04,153 --> 00:40:06,620
She sends her regrets.

890
00:40:06,622 --> 00:40:08,622
She really wanted to be here tonight.

891
00:40:09,801 --> 00:40:11,525
No, she didn't.

892
00:40:11,527 --> 00:40:13,160
I was surprised when you
called to schedule it.

893
00:40:13,162 --> 00:40:16,648
I mean, most people
just give the money and...

894
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:19,466
let the carriage ride go.

895
00:40:19,468 --> 00:40:22,235
Well, the truth is, I need a favor.

896
00:40:22,237 --> 00:40:24,838
And I was hoping I could
ask the mayor directly.

897
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,107
Happy to carry your water, Dr. Bull.

898
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,709
You remember the case you asked

899
00:40:28,711 --> 00:40:30,610
for my help on about a month ago?

900
00:40:30,612 --> 00:40:31,955
I do.

901
00:40:32,648 --> 00:40:33,915
We lost.

902
00:40:34,483 --> 00:40:37,050
I'm aware, but... it all worked out.

903
00:40:37,052 --> 00:40:39,353
The judge liked her;
gave her no jail time.

904
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:40,797
Not the worst ending.

905
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:44,157
But she's got a felony on her record,

906
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:47,828
and, uh, now she can't teach.

907
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:50,697
I just...

908
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:52,532
I think we lost one of the good ones,

909
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:55,702
maybe even one of the great ones.

910
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:58,773
Thing about teaching is,
if you're meant to do it,

911
00:40:59,899 --> 00:41:01,375
you're gonna do it.

912
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:02,876
Maybe not in a classroom.

913
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:05,154
Maybe not in the
State of New York, but...

914
00:41:06,242 --> 00:41:08,843
I just have a feeling
she's gonna be fine.

915
00:41:08,868 --> 00:41:12,269
Probably end up in
a private school somewhere.

916
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:14,521
Massachusetts, maybe.

917
00:41:14,523 --> 00:41:16,666
You seem to know an awful lot about her.

918
00:41:17,659 --> 00:41:19,960
I'll let you in on a little secret.

919
00:41:19,962 --> 00:41:21,962
The reason I sought you out that night?

920
00:41:21,964 --> 00:41:24,197
Her father is a bigwig in the party.

921
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:26,400
Major contributor,
especially in New England.

922
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:29,403
He knew his daughter would never
accept any help from him,

923
00:41:29,405 --> 00:41:32,272
so he asked our office to intervene.

924
00:41:32,274 --> 00:41:34,107
He called the mayor himself.

925
00:41:36,979 --> 00:41:38,879
In any event,

926
00:41:38,881 --> 00:41:40,514
your client's gonna be fine.

927
00:41:40,516 --> 00:41:42,249
Was that your favor?

928
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:45,452
What is it about what we do

929
00:41:45,454 --> 00:41:47,822
that makes it so hard to trust people?

930
00:41:48,791 --> 00:41:50,090
Excuse me?

931
00:41:50,092 --> 00:41:51,792
Agree or disagree:

932
00:41:51,794 --> 00:41:55,695
Honesty is the best policy in all cases.

933
00:41:55,697 --> 00:41:58,333
I don't think I understand.

934
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:00,967
I'm sure you don't.

935
00:42:02,805 --> 00:42:05,472
I need the mayor, or someone
from the mayor's office,

936
00:42:05,474 --> 00:42:08,308
to get on the phone and find a place

937
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:11,711
for Tyler Young to go to a city college.

938
00:42:12,221 --> 00:42:14,981
That would be highly irregular

939
00:42:14,983 --> 00:42:17,517
for the mayor to use her influence

940
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:21,455
to gain admission for any individual...

941
00:42:21,457 --> 00:42:23,590
It could even be construed as unethical.

942
00:42:23,592 --> 00:42:25,759
Like the way the mayor twisted my arm

943
00:42:25,761 --> 00:42:28,295
to get me to work for free
so she could curry favor

944
00:42:28,297 --> 00:42:30,156
with a party bigwig?

945
00:42:31,074 --> 00:42:32,999
You ever heard of Machiavelli?

946
00:42:33,001 --> 00:42:35,745
Very successful politician.

947
00:42:36,238 --> 00:42:39,940
I think he and the mayor would
have gotten along really well.

948
00:42:41,043 --> 00:42:44,744
Get the Tyler Young
college thing done for me.

949
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:49,342
Shouldn't be a problem.

950
00:42:49,885 --> 00:42:51,135
Great.

951
00:42:52,387 --> 00:42:54,754
Driver, I'm gonna hop off.

952
00:42:54,756 --> 00:42:56,890
I got what I came for.

953
00:42:56,892 --> 00:42:58,643
Thanks for the ride.

954
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:25,822

1
00:00:05,424 --> 00:00:06,622
Aah!

2
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,965
Not now.
I got four kills.

3
00:00:12,356 --> 00:00:13,801
Come on, Theo.

4
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:15,627
If we don't do it now,
we never will.

5
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:17,418
Mom and Dad
are gonna be home soon.

6
00:00:17,506 --> 00:00:18,925
Okay.
So we never do it.

7
00:00:19,013 --> 00:00:20,715
I'm fine with that.

8
00:00:24,797 --> 00:00:25,926
I'm kidding.

9
00:00:28,668 --> 00:00:29,769
Come on.

10
00:00:29,937 --> 00:00:31,215
Let's get this done.

11
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,747
You have to swear

12
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,682
you never tell anyone
I showed you this.

13
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:00,957
I swear.

14
00:01:01,147 --> 00:01:02,496
Seriously,
I mean it.

15
00:01:02,636 --> 00:01:04,051
I mean it, too.

16
00:01:05,604 --> 00:01:07,410
Turn around.

17
00:01:14,317 --> 00:01:16,457
Okay.
Turn back around.

18
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,707
You gonna take it out?

19
00:01:23,991 --> 00:01:25,075
I don't have
to take it out.

20
00:01:25,163 --> 00:01:26,262
Then can I take it out?

21
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,619
You're not even
supposed to touch it.

22
00:01:27,706 --> 00:01:29,387
Then can you take it out?

23
00:01:30,702 --> 00:01:32,426
Okay.
But you owe me one.

24
00:01:39,398 --> 00:01:41,000
Theo, you got to
let me touch it.

25
00:01:41,088 --> 00:01:42,664
It's not gonna happen,
little brother.

26
00:01:42,752 --> 00:01:44,029
Dad would be
out of his mind

27
00:01:44,117 --> 00:01:45,162
if he knew I even
told you about it.

28
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,317
Just let me see what it feels
like, just for a second.

29
00:01:51,848 --> 00:01:53,737
Okay, but only for a second.

30
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:04,746
Pow. Okay, dial it
down there, cowboy.

31
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:06,293
Don't point it
at anyone or anything.

32
00:02:06,388 --> 00:02:08,216
What if I actually
pulled the trigger?

33
00:02:08,427 --> 00:02:12,344
Well, it's empty, but let's not.

34
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:14,433
Okay, that's enough.
Give it back.

35
00:02:15,487 --> 00:02:16,641
Seriously. I mean it.

36
00:02:16,729 --> 00:02:18,511
Hey... Ow!

37
00:02:19,034 --> 00:02:21,761
Oh, did-did you hear that?
Was that Mom and Dad?

38
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:24,197
- Damn. Give me the...
- Ow...

39
00:02:24,285 --> 00:02:25,737
Was that the door?

40
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:33,596
Mom?

41
00:02:33,974 --> 00:02:35,393
Dad?

42
00:02:36,313 --> 00:02:37,662
Hello?

43
00:02:42,171 --> 00:02:44,417
Charlie, put the damn gun down.

44
00:02:46,215 --> 00:02:47,738
Theo!

45
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:51,829
I think it's clear
to anyone who's spent time

46
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:55,190
with him that Charlie Crawford
is filled with sorrow

47
00:02:55,386 --> 00:02:57,682
and remorse over
what he's done.

48
00:02:58,257 --> 00:03:01,315
His brother's death at his own hand,
though the product

49
00:03:01,403 --> 00:03:02,550
of a horrible accident

50
00:03:02,638 --> 00:03:05,728
over which he had no control,
is something

51
00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:08,229
that is gonna stay with him
for the rest of his life.

52
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:11,534
Were you and your
brother close, Charlie?

53
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,292
He was my best friend
in the world.

54
00:03:16,854 --> 00:03:18,745
I loved my brother.

55
00:03:19,346 --> 00:03:20,948
Everybody loved my brother.

56
00:03:21,036 --> 00:03:23,175
Everybody loves you, too,
Charlie.

57
00:03:23,263 --> 00:03:25,932
Everybody knows that
this was not your fault.

58
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,948
What are you looking for?

59
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,761
We're looking for mercy.

60
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:37,344
Charlie is 13 and a half
years old.

61
00:03:37,432 --> 00:03:39,534
He is a gifted
student.

62
00:03:39,777 --> 00:03:41,823
I can personally vouch
for the family.

63
00:03:41,911 --> 00:03:44,136
Eric and I have known
each other since college.

64
00:03:44,343 --> 00:03:45,486
He runs

65
00:03:45,574 --> 00:03:47,020
an international
consulting firm.

66
00:03:47,108 --> 00:03:48,371
His wife Lena

67
00:03:48,575 --> 00:03:50,401
is a highly sought-after
patent lawyer.

68
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:51,838
They're great people.

69
00:03:51,927 --> 00:03:53,339
They're great parents.

70
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:54,987
And they have lost
their firstborn.

71
00:03:55,247 --> 00:03:56,964
To compound that
by incarcerating

72
00:03:57,052 --> 00:04:00,731
the only other child they have...
I just can't imagine

73
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:03,534
what legitimate purpose
that would serve.

74
00:04:06,173 --> 00:04:08,331
So what's your sentencing
recommendation?

75
00:04:08,434 --> 00:04:10,096
Well, we would love
for you to knock down

76
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:13,706
the manslaughter charges
to negligent homicide,

77
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:16,921
recommend probation
and community service.

78
00:04:17,242 --> 00:04:18,448
Detective?

79
00:04:19,198 --> 00:04:20,503
I'm okay with that.

80
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,951
Fine. Dr. Bull,

81
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:25,604
Mr. Colón, I'm going
to adopt your proposal

82
00:04:25,692 --> 00:04:27,166
and take it to the judge.

83
00:04:27,254 --> 00:04:28,727
- Thank you, Ms. Glover.
- Thank you.

84
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:30,151
- Thank you so much.
- All right.

85
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:33,042
Oh, I-I'm sorry, everyone.

86
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,143
I still need you
to take your seats.

87
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:42,971
Mr. Crawford, I want
to talk for a minute

88
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:44,604
about the gun.

89
00:04:45,158 --> 00:04:48,179
The gun is a licensed

90
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:49,920
and registered weapon.

91
00:04:50,108 --> 00:04:52,546
It was kept in
a locked box

92
00:04:52,712 --> 00:04:54,931
that was stored
in a locked safe.

93
00:04:55,727 --> 00:04:57,729
How'd your son get
the combinations?

94
00:04:59,803 --> 00:05:01,229
I gave them to him.

95
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:02,953
Why?

96
00:05:03,674 --> 00:05:04,987
I just...

97
00:05:05,768 --> 00:05:06,878
made a decision,

98
00:05:06,966 --> 00:05:09,729
last year, when
he turned 17.

99
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:13,042
I wanted him to know
how to use a weapon.

100
00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:16,440
I started taking him
to the firing range

101
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:18,355
for practice,

102
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:20,190
and we talked
about safety...

103
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:21,518
constantly.

104
00:05:21,628 --> 00:05:24,628
Be that as it may,
your late son was a minor.

105
00:05:25,815 --> 00:05:27,667
Eric, why don't you
tell Ms. Glover

106
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:29,518
why you had the gun.

107
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:32,167
I've owned it
for 20 years.

108
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:35,136
I travel a lot
for business,

109
00:05:35,224 --> 00:05:36,237
and, um...

110
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:39,761
There have been a lot of
home invasions in our area.

111
00:05:40,153 --> 00:05:43,229
My neighbor was attacked
in her bedroom.

112
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,276
I just wanted to know
that my family was safe

113
00:05:45,364 --> 00:05:46,721
while I was away.

114
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,995
I even learned
how to shoot.

115
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,909
My husband taught Theo
in case something happened

116
00:05:52,012 --> 00:05:53,643
when neither one of us
was home.

117
00:05:53,739 --> 00:05:56,753
You gave a minor access
to a loaded handgun.

118
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:59,651
Having him pinky swear that
he wouldn't play with it or tell

119
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:02,276
his younger brother about it
isn't sufficient under the law.

120
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,620
I'm sorry for your
loss, Mr. Crawford.

121
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:10,076
I really am.

122
00:06:10,382 --> 00:06:12,971
But I believe your behavior
was negligent.

123
00:06:13,059 --> 00:06:14,974
Criminally negligent.

124
00:06:15,313 --> 00:06:17,402
And I'm putting
you under arrest.

125
00:06:18,193 --> 00:06:19,300
Detective Lacy,

126
00:06:19,388 --> 00:06:21,909
would you take Mr. Crawford
into custody, please?

127
00:06:24,153 --> 00:06:25,956
- Dad... Dad?
- Mr. Crawford? I need you to stand

128
00:06:26,043 --> 00:06:28,183
- and put your hands behind your back.
- Wait a min... Uh... Jace?

129
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,214
Just cooperate. We'll
go directly to court

130
00:06:30,302 --> 00:06:31,480
and we will get
you out on bail.

131
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:32,807
Eric...

132
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,034
I love you.

133

135
00:06:57,339 --> 00:06:58,573
Charlie?

136
00:06:58,807 --> 00:07:00,526
Yes? I'm Marissa.

137
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:03,128
Uh, Dr. Bull, Mr. Colón
and your mom

138
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:05,964
are gonna be
just a little while longer.

139
00:07:14,806 --> 00:07:16,128
Pretty cool, huh?

140
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,886
What's it doing?

141
00:07:18,068 --> 00:07:20,190
I know it's doing something.
But what is it?

142
00:07:20,285 --> 00:07:23,072
Well, that is someone
from the potential jury pool,

143
00:07:23,248 --> 00:07:25,846
the people that we get
to pick from to make up a jury.

144
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:29,057
And the algorithm
is looking for someone

145
00:07:29,145 --> 00:07:32,136
in our pool of candidates
that's a good match.

146
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:35,221
Same gender,
same socioeconomic group,

147
00:07:35,309 --> 00:07:38,354
same political
and religious attitudes.

148
00:07:38,442 --> 00:07:39,508
Why?

149
00:07:39,596 --> 00:07:42,698
So we can get them to help us
figure out how a trial is going.

150
00:07:43,314 --> 00:07:45,003
What the real jurors
are thinking.

151
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,331
We call them mirror jurors.

152
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:50,511
- And that works?
- Most of the time.

153
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,901
We usually get pretty close.

154
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:55,035
Hmm.
Who thought this up?

155
00:07:56,398 --> 00:07:58,206
Well, I did.

156
00:07:58,574 --> 00:08:00,620
The algorithm part
of it, anyway.

157
00:08:00,724 --> 00:08:02,042
Uh, this part of it.

158
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,761
Not Dr. Bull?

159
00:08:04,282 --> 00:08:05,549
He helped.

160
00:08:07,203 --> 00:08:09,050
You know what
he is great at?

161
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:11,112
The people part of it.

162
00:08:11,265 --> 00:08:12,550
The part that
math and science

163
00:08:12,638 --> 00:08:14,755
can't quite figure out
just yet.

164
00:08:15,145 --> 00:08:18,801
The parts that we can't see
or quantify.

165
00:08:19,553 --> 00:08:21,598
What makes a person tick.

166
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:24,471
What's going on in there.

167
00:08:27,648 --> 00:08:30,364
Is he gonna be able
to get my dad out of jail?

168
00:08:32,138 --> 00:08:34,364
Am I ever gonna
see him again?

169
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:37,654
I mean,
he didn't do anything.

170
00:08:39,897 --> 00:08:41,263
I did it.

171
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,448
I did it.

172
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,794
I ruined everybody's life.

173
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:51,247
My brother's dead,
my dad's going to jail.

174
00:08:51,335 --> 00:08:52,902
My mom must hate me.

175
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:56,645
I hate me.

176
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:59,888
Charlie.

177
00:08:59,991 --> 00:09:01,138
Come on.

178
00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:03,034
Dr. Bull and
Mr. Colón did it.

179
00:09:03,122 --> 00:09:04,911
They got your father
out on bail.

180
00:09:05,794 --> 00:09:07,528
Come on. We have
to get him out.

181
00:09:16,871 --> 00:09:18,294
Are you down here?

182
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,638
I'm very down here.

183
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,622
Why you ask?

184
00:09:23,598 --> 00:09:25,716
I rolled over
and you were gone.

185
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:32,661
You want to get married?

186
00:09:34,497 --> 00:09:35,786
To who?

187
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:42,573
I... want to get
this science project

188
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:44,228
out of my belly.

189
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,223
I just want to see
my feet again when I walk.

190
00:09:47,311 --> 00:09:48,905
I want to remember
the good old days

191
00:09:48,993 --> 00:09:51,817
when the food I ate
just went in one direction.

192
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:55,434
Why?

193
00:09:56,188 --> 00:09:57,927
Are you going someplace?

194
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,052
Not without you.

195
00:10:02,013 --> 00:10:03,896
Then why are you in such
a hurry to do something

196
00:10:03,984 --> 00:10:05,820
that we failed
at the first time?

197
00:10:08,355 --> 00:10:10,958
You love me,
don't you?

198
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,091
I'm afraid so.

199
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,167
You love me?

200
00:10:16,793 --> 00:10:18,220
Most of the time.

201
00:10:20,605 --> 00:10:22,129
What are you doing
over there?

202
00:10:22,325 --> 00:10:24,175
Come here
and give me a kiss.

203
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,351
Earn your keep.

204
00:10:26,856 --> 00:10:28,114
You know,

205
00:10:28,202 --> 00:10:30,716
that nine-month doctor's note
you got

206
00:10:31,312 --> 00:10:33,755
is about to expire
in seven weeks.

207
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:35,317
You know what that means.
That means

208
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:37,493
you're gonna have to go
back to work full-time,

209
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,911
start cleaning and cooking

210
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:43,450
and washing my clothes
in the river.

211
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:46,936
Is that the Hudson River?

212
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,747
Yes, it is.

213
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,684
Bring it over here.

214
00:11:01,386 --> 00:11:02,856
Are you scared?

215
00:11:04,223 --> 00:11:05,552
Terrified.

216
00:11:06,488 --> 00:11:08,278
Me too.

217
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,446
So who are we
looking for today, boss?

218
00:11:18,534 --> 00:11:20,493
We are cruising the aisle

219
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,538
- marked "cognitive empathy."
- Ah,

220
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,981
I know that aisle.
We've shopped there before.

221
00:11:25,356 --> 00:11:28,543
We need to eliminate anyone
who isn't willing or able

222
00:11:28,631 --> 00:11:30,661
to put themselves
in Eric's shoes,

223
00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:33,995
to empathize with a man
who didn't pull the trigger,

224
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,333
but lost his
firstborn,

225
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:39,530
and is nonetheless being
charged with his murder.

226
00:11:39,856 --> 00:11:41,114
Exactly.

227
00:11:41,255 --> 00:11:42,403
Good morning.

228
00:11:42,758 --> 00:11:46,044
So, let's start
with a hypothetical.

229
00:11:46,354 --> 00:11:49,888
You're out shopping when
you hear a cry for help.

230
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:53,110
Someone can't find their child.
What do you do?

231
00:11:53,645 --> 00:11:55,020
I look around.

232
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:57,473
See if other people
are looking around.

233
00:11:57,802 --> 00:11:59,770
And if a lot of people
are looking around,

234
00:11:59,874 --> 00:12:02,638
I... probably keep shopping.

235
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,614
I-I mean,
I'd keep an eye out,

236
00:12:06,702 --> 00:12:09,614
but I probably wouldn't stop
what I was doing.

237
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,864
If it pleases the court,
we'd like to thank

238
00:12:12,952 --> 00:12:14,258
and excuse this juror.

239
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:16,005
I'll bet you would.

240
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:19,239
I'd like to think that I would
stop what I was doing.

241
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:21,184
You know,
see what I could to to help out.

242
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,270
I mean, how scary is that,
to lose your kid?

243
00:12:26,132 --> 00:12:29,448
So, you're at a coffee shop,
you're waiting in line,

244
00:12:29,536 --> 00:12:31,911
and the person in front of you
is short two dollars.

245
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:33,169
What's your first instinct?

246
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:35,036
I ask if I can
jump ahead of 'em.

247
00:12:35,124 --> 00:12:36,760
I mean, who doesn't
check their wallet

248
00:12:36,848 --> 00:12:38,092
before they order
something?

249
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:41,466
I'd probably
pay for his drink.

250
00:12:42,038 --> 00:12:43,213
I just would.

251
00:12:44,315 --> 00:12:46,317
This juror is
acceptable, Your Honor.

252
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,075
Excellent.
We have our jury.

253
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,718
So,
who opened the floor safe?

254
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:58,341
Theo did.

255
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,915
My brother did.

256
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,552
And who opened
the portable gun safe?

257
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,989
I think Theo did.

258
00:13:05,682 --> 00:13:07,380
'Cause I begged him to.

259
00:13:08,577 --> 00:13:11,778
Any idea how he might have
gotten the combinations

260
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:13,286
to both of these safes?

261
00:13:13,374 --> 00:13:15,106
Objection, Your Honor.

262
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,841
Calls for hearsay.

263
00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:19,668
And, Your Honor,
in an effort to

264
00:13:19,903 --> 00:13:22,832
spare this witness
any more trauma than necessary,

265
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,170
the defense would like
to stipulate

266
00:13:24,257 --> 00:13:27,395
that our client,
Eric Crawford, provided

267
00:13:27,483 --> 00:13:30,050
his oldest son
with the combinations

268
00:13:30,138 --> 00:13:31,450
to both safes.

269
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:33,364
We've made
no secret of this.

270
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:35,192
Objection sustained.

271
00:13:35,802 --> 00:13:37,804
Ask another
question.

272
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:40,574
Does this look like
the Post-it

273
00:13:40,669 --> 00:13:42,411
that you saw
in your brother's hand

274
00:13:42,499 --> 00:13:44,022
the night he was shot?

275
00:13:44,497 --> 00:13:45,911
Uh...

276
00:13:46,377 --> 00:13:48,013
I th-I think so.

277
00:13:48,249 --> 00:13:50,990
My brother didn't really
let me see it.

278
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:54,516
And do you see the
two sets of numbers on it?

279
00:13:57,785 --> 00:13:59,809
Yeah, I do.

280
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,723
And does it look like
your father's handwriting?

281
00:14:02,811 --> 00:14:04,030
Objection!

282
00:14:04,317 --> 00:14:06,434
We've already stipulated this.

283
00:14:06,522 --> 00:14:08,864
The prosecution
is badgering the witness.

284
00:14:08,957 --> 00:14:11,145
Sustained.
Ask another question.

285
00:14:12,781 --> 00:14:14,216
Charlie...

286
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:16,993
what else is on this paper?

287
00:14:22,552 --> 00:14:24,552
There's-there's some...
there's some blood.

288
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,989
Your Honor.

289
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,286
Ask another question.

290
00:14:31,063 --> 00:14:34,239
So, when your brother

291
00:14:34,591 --> 00:14:36,497
used the combination

292
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:38,544
that your father gave him,

293
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:41,294
and opened up
the two safes

294
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,270
and gave you the gun...
He-he did...

295
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:45,317
he didn't-he didn't
give me the gun.

296
00:14:47,247 --> 00:14:50,381
I mean, he did,
but I had to beg him for it.

297
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:51,774
He didn't want to.

298
00:14:51,962 --> 00:14:54,497
But at some point
he did give it to you.

299
00:14:55,063 --> 00:14:57,544
And did you know
there was a bullet in it?

300
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,075
Of course not.
No.

301
00:15:00,163 --> 00:15:01,536
He-he told me it was empty.

302
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:03,104
How did he know it was empty?

303
00:15:03,192 --> 00:15:04,192
Did he look?

304
00:15:05,012 --> 00:15:07,169
No, he... he just knew.

305
00:15:07,257 --> 00:15:09,347
Dad always kept it empty.

306
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:12,536
Well...

307
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,630
almost always.

308
00:15:16,604 --> 00:15:18,552
I have no further questions.

309
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,794
Would you kindly tell the court

310
00:15:21,882 --> 00:15:23,319
your name and
occupation?

311
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:24,847
My name is Laura Coleman.

312
00:15:24,935 --> 00:15:26,894
I manage the West Side
Rod and Gun Club.

313
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:29,551
And even though you
refer to it as a club,

314
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,341
it's really a gun range.

315
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:33,481
A place for people
to practice shooting

316
00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:36,427
and enjoy their firearms
by firing at targets?

317
00:15:36,515 --> 00:15:37,690
Yes, exactly.

318
00:15:37,778 --> 00:15:39,958
And are you familiar
with the defendant,

319
00:15:40,046 --> 00:15:41,221
Eric Crawford?

320
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:43,391
Yes, I see him quite often
around the club.

321
00:15:43,479 --> 00:15:45,138
And at your club,

322
00:15:45,226 --> 00:15:47,302
you make use of
security cameras?

323
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,001
Yes, we have 16 cameras
all around the facility.

324
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:52,669
And were you able
to locate the tapes

325
00:15:52,757 --> 00:15:55,325
that coincided with
Mr. Crawford's most recent visit?

326
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,475
Yes.

327
00:15:56,563 --> 00:15:58,575
And did you bring any
of these digital recordings

328
00:15:58,663 --> 00:15:59,467
with you today?

329
00:15:59,555 --> 00:16:01,114
I did.
I brought security footage

330
00:16:01,202 --> 00:16:03,567
from the two cameras
that are above the exit.

331
00:16:03,655 --> 00:16:05,048
Objection, Your Honor.

332
00:16:05,222 --> 00:16:08,138
This violates the people's
discovery obligations.

333
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:10,036
Your Honor,
we apologize,

334
00:16:10,124 --> 00:16:12,481
but my office just became
aware of these recordings

335
00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:14,029
when Ms. Coleman
arrived this morning.

336
00:16:14,116 --> 00:16:15,682
Oh, well, that's
all well and good,

337
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,120
but my team is being
made aware of it

338
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,919
for the first time right now.

339
00:16:20,372 --> 00:16:22,243
We're being blindsided,
Your Honor.

340
00:16:22,658 --> 00:16:25,122
I'm gonna take Ms. Glover
at her word

341
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:28,213
that these tapes just fell
into her lap today.

342
00:16:29,836 --> 00:16:31,359
Ask your
next question,

343
00:16:31,447 --> 00:16:32,927
counselor.

344
00:16:33,653 --> 00:16:36,770
So you reviewed
the security tapes

345
00:16:36,858 --> 00:16:39,145
and brought images
from two cameras

346
00:16:39,236 --> 00:16:41,481
- positioned above the exit?
- Yes.

347
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:43,816
Let's take a look.

348
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,895
So, these signs...

349
00:16:47,983 --> 00:16:50,598
This area...
Specifically exists

350
00:16:50,841 --> 00:16:52,911
to remind your patrons

351
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:54,606
that they need to stop

352
00:16:54,693 --> 00:16:57,536
and be doubly sure that
their weapons are empty

353
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,524
before they leave
the range?

354
00:16:59,611 --> 00:17:00,927
Exactly.

355
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,278
It's check,
and then I win your queen.

356
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:54,794
Dude, you're killing me.

357
00:17:54,882 --> 00:17:55,973
How old are you again?

358
00:17:56,061 --> 00:17:59,020
It's simple: I don't
want to be there anymore.

359
00:17:59,108 --> 00:18:01,114
Lena, there are
optics to consider.

360
00:18:01,202 --> 00:18:02,739
If you stop coming
to court...

361
00:18:02,827 --> 00:18:04,716
If you appear to have
given up on your husband...

362
00:18:04,803 --> 00:18:05,864
Why shouldn't the jury?

363
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:08,169
The jury is gonna do
what the jury's gonna do.

364
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:12,997
I have one
child left.

365
00:18:13,786 --> 00:18:16,466
And he's spending his days
with babysitters.

366
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,020
Strangers.

367
00:18:18,384 --> 00:18:20,247
So I can sit
in a courtroom

368
00:18:20,335 --> 00:18:21,669
and support a man

369
00:18:21,757 --> 00:18:23,450
who'd rather talk on
his phone

370
00:18:23,538 --> 00:18:25,552
- than empty his gun.
- Come on!

371
00:18:25,657 --> 00:18:27,659
Come on!
Come on!

372
00:18:27,747 --> 00:18:29,528
Mr. Crawford, Mrs. Crawford,
please,

373
00:18:29,616 --> 00:18:32,231
let's... let's not turn
on each other.

374
00:18:32,414 --> 00:18:34,098
I've been married
to that damn phone

375
00:18:34,186 --> 00:18:35,231
for 20 years.

376
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:37,039
I didn't check the gun
because I knew

377
00:18:37,127 --> 00:18:39,564
I had already fired off
all six shots at the range.

378
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:40,888
I knewthe gun was empty.

379
00:18:40,976 --> 00:18:42,934
Then who loaded it?!

380
00:18:43,835 --> 00:18:45,489
Do not say Theo.

381
00:18:45,857 --> 00:18:47,653
I will not have you
blame him for this

382
00:18:47,741 --> 00:18:50,092
when he is not here
to defend himself.

383
00:18:59,341 --> 00:19:00,833
Lena, I know you're upset.

384
00:19:01,665 --> 00:19:04,255
But I also know you don't want
your husband to go to prison.

385
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,692
That would be
a catastrophe,

386
00:19:06,004 --> 00:19:07,559
for you and for Charlie.

387
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,848
I guarantee you,
if you don't show up in court,

388
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:14,716
the outcome
is a foregone conclusion.

389
00:19:14,804 --> 00:19:16,817
If you act out
in front of a jury,

390
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:18,941
you're telling them
to send him to prison.

391
00:19:20,351 --> 00:19:21,864
So I implore you...

392
00:19:22,434 --> 00:19:23,731
both of you...

393
00:19:24,036 --> 00:19:26,091
present a
united front.

394
00:19:27,496 --> 00:19:28,934
For Charlie.

395
00:19:36,084 --> 00:19:37,202
Please tell the jury

396
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,778
your name
and what it is you do.

397
00:19:38,874 --> 00:19:41,263
My name is Debra Erwin,
and I'm a paramedic.

398
00:19:41,737 --> 00:19:44,091
And on the afternoon
of the shooting,

399
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:45,978
you were dispatched
to the Crawford home.

400
00:19:46,066 --> 00:19:47,316
Isn't that correct?- Correct.

401
00:19:47,404 --> 00:19:48,431
My partner and I were

402
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:49,778
the first to arrive
on scene.

403
00:19:49,866 --> 00:19:51,742
We were there to render
medical aid,

404
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,427
but we found the victim
to be unresponsive.

405
00:19:54,737 --> 00:19:57,325
And can you describe
the injury?

406
00:19:57,451 --> 00:19:59,583
A single gunshot wound
to the head.

407
00:19:59,897 --> 00:20:01,419
And was there

408
00:20:01,507 --> 00:20:03,763
anyone else in the house
when you arrived?

409
00:20:03,874 --> 00:20:05,817
Yes, the victim's
little brother.

410
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,769
I believe
his name was Charlie.

411
00:20:08,043 --> 00:20:10,176
I think he told us
he was 13 years old.

412
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,872
Thank you.
Nothing further.

413
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,502
What's it look like
from where you're sitting?

414
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,388
We are holding steady.
We have four green

415
00:20:17,476 --> 00:20:19,388
<i>and eight red.</i>

416
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:22,675
Ms. Erwin, were you present

417
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:26,288
when my client and his wife
arrived at the home?

418
00:20:26,376 --> 00:20:27,290
I was.

419
00:20:27,378 --> 00:20:28,727
And what did you see?

420
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,380
Were they upset?

421
00:20:30,755 --> 00:20:31,958
My God, of course.

422
00:20:32,046 --> 00:20:34,527
Is it fair to say that
they were devastated?

423
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:36,090
At the very least.

424
00:20:36,178 --> 00:20:37,364
Inconsolable?

425
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:40,542
Absolutely.
Their child was dead.

426
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:42,338
When they left their house,

427
00:20:42,426 --> 00:20:44,090
their child was alive.

428
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,432
And when they came home,
their child was dead.

429
00:20:46,925 --> 00:20:48,926
I see. And...

430
00:20:49,095 --> 00:20:50,325
Did they actually

431
00:20:50,413 --> 00:20:52,208
get to see their son?

432
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,333
I mean, was his
body still there?

433
00:20:55,437 --> 00:20:57,637
Yes, he was laying there
in the closet.

434
00:20:57,725 --> 00:20:59,422
A gunshot wound to the head.

435
00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:04,184
And did they actually watch
him getting zipped into...

436
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,497
into the body bag?

437
00:21:06,755 --> 00:21:08,380
Just the father at first.

438
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,298
The mother was too upset.

439
00:21:10,556 --> 00:21:12,895
But then she showed up
at the last minute.

440
00:21:13,741 --> 00:21:15,351
Kissed him on the cheek.

441
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,106
Thank you for your
testimony, Ms. Erwin.

442
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:23,120
Nothing further,
Your Honor.

443
00:21:23,505 --> 00:21:25,020
Why are you not saying 
anything?

444
00:21:25,108 --> 00:21:26,903
<i>Sorry. We just picked up two.</i>

445
00:21:27,512 --> 00:21:29,919
<i>We have six red, six green.</i>

446
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:35,981
Good day, no?

447
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:39,208
Yes.
Yes, it was.

448
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,692
Marissa feels the jury
is evenly split.

449
00:21:44,193 --> 00:21:46,544
I even saw a couple of jurors
with tears in their eyes,

450
00:21:46,632 --> 00:21:48,958
and we haven't even
presented our case yet.

451
00:21:50,082 --> 00:21:52,411
So what's going through
that brain of yours?

452
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:56,882
It's probably nothing.

453
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,833
Oh, come on. Talk to me.

454
00:22:01,032 --> 00:22:02,732
That paramedic.

455
00:22:03,042 --> 00:22:06,524
She kept talking about Eric and Lena,
how upset they were.

456
00:22:06,612 --> 00:22:07,880
I know.

457
00:22:07,989 --> 00:22:10,482
It was like manna from heaven.

458
00:22:10,608 --> 00:22:13,941
Mm. You notice
she didn't mention Charlie?

459
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,872
Yeah. So?

460
00:22:16,573 --> 00:22:18,583
Well, don't you think
he was upset?

461
00:22:21,067 --> 00:22:22,950
Well, that goes without saying.

462
00:22:23,378 --> 00:22:25,815
Mm.
I just find it fascinating

463
00:22:25,903 --> 00:22:27,286
she wouldn't mention it.

464
00:22:27,709 --> 00:22:30,843
He's a child. And he's the one
who pulled the trigger.

465
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:33,708
Yeah, but it might be just
as simple as the fact

466
00:22:33,796 --> 00:22:36,911
that... no one talked
about Charlie.

467
00:22:37,183 --> 00:22:40,068
You know?
Charlie's not the one on trial.

468
00:22:41,648 --> 00:22:42,927
Okay.

469
00:22:43,015 --> 00:22:44,544
If you say so.

470
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,841
911. What's your emergency?

471
00:22:46,956 --> 00:22:50,114
Um,
I-I just shot my brother.

472
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:52,117
I did it by accident.

473
00:22:52,212 --> 00:22:53,943
I didn't know
the gun was loaded.

474
00:22:54,031 --> 00:22:56,638
Okay. Don't worry, honey.
Help is on the way.

475
00:22:56,726 --> 00:22:58,583
Can you check to see
if he's breathing?

476
00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:01,608
Actually,
I think he's dead.

477
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,424
911.
What's your emergency?

478
00:23:05,282 --> 00:23:08,210
Um, I-I just shot my brother.

479
00:23:08,475 --> 00:23:10,538
I did it by accident.

480
00:23:10,626 --> 00:23:12,015
I didn't know
the gun was loaded.

481
00:23:12,103 --> 00:23:14,554
Okay. Don't worry, honey.
Help is on the way.

482
00:23:14,796 --> 00:23:17,190
Can you check to see
if he's breathing?

483
00:23:17,566 --> 00:23:19,630
Actually, I think he's dead.

484
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:22,030
Honey,
I need you to do something for me.

485
00:23:22,126 --> 00:23:24,563
Just check to see
if he has a pulse.

486
00:23:28,092 --> 00:23:30,216
I'm sorry.
Did I see what?

487
00:23:30,457 --> 00:23:32,937
Did you see
Theo load the gun?

488
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,763
Dr. Bull, if I had seen Theo
load the gun,

489
00:23:36,851 --> 00:23:38,418
I never would have fired it.

490
00:23:40,821 --> 00:23:42,732
Right.
Of course.

491
00:23:44,835 --> 00:23:47,045
Is that what you wanted
to ask me?

492
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:49,068
Is that why you wanted
to see me this morning?

493
00:23:49,164 --> 00:23:51,396
Well, that and...

494
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:54,173
I wanted to see
how you were holding up.

495
00:23:55,538 --> 00:23:57,037
I'm okay.

496
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,435
Home is weird.

497
00:24:02,127 --> 00:24:03,630
Either it's really quiet

498
00:24:03,718 --> 00:24:05,998
or Mom and Dad
are fighting.

499
00:24:06,563 --> 00:24:08,357
I think they miss Theo.

500
00:24:08,962 --> 00:24:12,318
Well, I suppose
that's to be expected.

501
00:24:13,117 --> 00:24:14,490
I suppose.

502
00:24:22,815 --> 00:24:24,466
Sorry.

503
00:24:28,348 --> 00:24:29,623
You yawned?

504
00:24:29,908 --> 00:24:31,171
Like you were bored?

505
00:24:31,274 --> 00:24:32,805
More like I was tired.

506
00:24:32,944 --> 00:24:35,015
And Charlie
didn't respond.

507
00:24:35,534 --> 00:24:37,491
That... is-is that
supposed to mean something?

508
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:38,617
Mm.

509
00:24:38,705 --> 00:24:39,976
Catching a yawn

510
00:24:40,064 --> 00:24:42,469
is indicative
of empathy.

511
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:46,187
Sorry. When someone just says
the word "yawn" I yawn.

512
00:24:46,275 --> 00:24:49,104
Exactly. Usually, when one
person in a room yawns,

513
00:24:49,192 --> 00:24:50,812
everyone in
the room yawns.

514
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,164
It's a simple test
psychologists use.

515
00:24:53,252 --> 00:24:54,644
A test for what?

516
00:24:54,732 --> 00:24:56,390
Sociopathy.

517
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:58,078
Sociopathy.

518
00:25:03,575 --> 00:25:04,851
What?

519
00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:06,715
You haven't yawned yet.

520
00:25:06,953 --> 00:25:08,891
Sorry.
I'm not a yawner.

521
00:25:09,265 --> 00:25:10,664
Does that make me
a bad person?

522
00:25:10,752 --> 00:25:13,146
Well, unless I misunderstood,
it sounds like Bull is saying

523
00:25:13,234 --> 00:25:14,549
it makes you
a sociopath.

524
00:25:14,636 --> 00:25:15,726
Not exactly.

525
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,617
We rely on
other indicators as well.

526
00:25:18,705 --> 00:25:20,277
But... So the kid doesn't yawn,

527
00:25:20,365 --> 00:25:22,250
and you're saying he
might be a sociopath.

528
00:25:22,546 --> 00:25:25,265
I'm saying I suspect
he lacks empathy.

529
00:25:26,303 --> 00:25:28,523
I listened to that
911 call again.

530
00:25:28,955 --> 00:25:30,695
- And?
- And it

531
00:25:30,783 --> 00:25:32,307
is a sales pitch.

532
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,915
Uh, what does that mean?

533
00:25:34,003 --> 00:25:35,555
Well, why do you call 911?

534
00:25:35,643 --> 00:25:36,781
To get help.

535
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,086
Exactly.
And, to me,

536
00:25:40,097 --> 00:25:41,620
it just sounded like
Charlie

537
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,449
was trying to get
a story out.

538
00:25:45,148 --> 00:25:47,052
And people
who call 911

539
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,888
rarely say someone's dead.

540
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,451
But Theo was dead.

541
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:52,615
It doesn't matter.
People usually hold out hope

542
00:25:52,703 --> 00:25:54,982
until someone
definitively says it's over,

543
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,219
that their loved one
absolutely can't be saved.

544
00:25:57,307 --> 00:26:00,223
Okay, assuming Charlie
is a sociopath,

545
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,021
how does that affect our case?

546
00:26:02,109 --> 00:26:04,633
Sociopaths are
pathological liars.

547
00:26:04,728 --> 00:26:05,953
So are you saying he lied

548
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:08,055
about how the bullet
got into the gun?

549
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:11,344
So maybe Eric's recollection
was correct.

550
00:26:11,797 --> 00:26:14,414
Maybe he didn't leave
a loaded gun in the house.

551
00:26:14,742 --> 00:26:17,003
I think that little boy
loaded the gun.

552
00:26:17,414 --> 00:26:19,527
And I think
he shot his brother

553
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:21,052
in cold blood.

554
00:26:32,749 --> 00:26:34,500
You're not gonna
tell them... your theory

555
00:26:34,588 --> 00:26:36,094
about their son?

556
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,983
No, not at this point.
Not until I can prove it.

557
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:43,471
Morning.

558
00:26:44,024 --> 00:26:45,898
Jace, Mr. Colón.

559
00:26:45,986 --> 00:26:47,030
Everything all right?

560
00:26:47,118 --> 00:26:48,875
Yeah.
Everything's terrific.

561
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,288
Glad to see you brought
Charlie along.

562
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,938
It's important for
the jury to see

563
00:26:53,026 --> 00:26:55,028
the whole family in there
while you're testifying.

564
00:26:55,397 --> 00:26:57,617
See that there's something
to save.

565
00:26:58,273 --> 00:27:00,555
By the way,
this is Danny James.

566
00:27:00,709 --> 00:27:02,531
Mr. and Mrs. Crawford,
Charlie.

567
00:27:02,691 --> 00:27:04,825
She's an investigator who
works with me, and I was wondering

568
00:27:04,912 --> 00:27:08,101
if... it was possible for her
to take one more look

569
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,500
inside your home?

570
00:27:09,588 --> 00:27:11,640
One more look
at the crime scene,

571
00:27:11,728 --> 00:27:13,121
see if there's anything
we missed?

572
00:27:14,327 --> 00:27:16,531
Oh. The housekeeper's
there today.

573
00:27:16,757 --> 00:27:18,922
I'll give her a call.
She can let you in.

574
00:27:19,195 --> 00:27:21,198
- Terrific.
- Mr. Crawford,

575
00:27:21,285 --> 00:27:23,148
we all saw the tape.

576
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,655
You and your late
son making your way

577
00:27:25,743 --> 00:27:27,875
towards the exit
of the gun range.

578
00:27:28,234 --> 00:27:30,187
Signs imploring you

579
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:33,359
to... check that your gun
is empty.

580
00:27:34,254 --> 00:27:37,085
You seemingly
ignoring those signs.

581
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:38,993
Talking on the phone.

582
00:27:40,412 --> 00:27:41,882
Why is that?

583
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:45,460
Why wouldn't you check
to see if your gun was empty?

584
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:52,070
Well, I've thought about
that moment a great deal.

585
00:27:54,327 --> 00:27:55,796
At the time,

586
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:59,304
I would have sworn
on my son's life...

587
00:28:00,591 --> 00:28:02,506
...that the gun was empty.

588
00:28:03,335 --> 00:28:04,960
And the truth is,
I'm still prepared

589
00:28:05,048 --> 00:28:06,788
to swear that it was empty.

590
00:28:07,523 --> 00:28:09,343
The gun holds
six bullets.

591
00:28:10,048 --> 00:28:11,311
Six.

592
00:28:12,265 --> 00:28:13,687
Theo shot,

593
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,864
which was the reason
we were there.

594
00:28:16,644 --> 00:28:18,444
And then he gave...

595
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:20,007
he gave the gun to me.

596
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:23,230
I reloaded.

597
00:28:23,521 --> 00:28:25,226
Six bullets.

598
00:28:25,848 --> 00:28:27,484
Took six shots.

599
00:28:28,352 --> 00:28:30,609
I can tell you where
they struck on the target.

600
00:28:31,403 --> 00:28:34,640
I can tell you
the clothes I was wearing.

601
00:28:36,717 --> 00:28:38,124
The clothes he was wearing.

602
00:28:39,077 --> 00:28:41,452
I mean, I can tell you
what was in my pockets.

603
00:28:42,826 --> 00:28:46,452
Where we ate
after we left the range.

604
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:51,785
What my wife wore
to bed that night.

605
00:28:52,843 --> 00:28:55,379
What my youngest,
Charlie,

606
00:28:55,466 --> 00:28:59,078
was reading on his tablet
when I took it from him,

607
00:29:00,016 --> 00:29:02,702
told him it was time
to go to sleep.

608
00:29:06,738 --> 00:29:10,045
I'm not-I'm not trying
to make this hard for you.

609
00:29:10,706 --> 00:29:12,487
Six bullets.

610
00:29:13,721 --> 00:29:15,448
Six shots.

611
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,053
I swear to you.

612
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:22,237
I remember every damn one.

613
00:29:26,147 --> 00:29:27,619
Thank you.

614
00:29:28,111 --> 00:29:30,018
No further questions,
Your Honor.

615
00:29:30,127 --> 00:29:31,729
Oh, my God.
They believe him.

616
00:29:31,817 --> 00:29:33,979
Three of them believe him.
We just got

617
00:29:34,067 --> 00:29:35,633
<i>three greens.</i>

618
00:29:39,285 --> 00:29:40,909
That was a nice story.

619
00:29:40,997 --> 00:29:42,389
Your Honor.

620
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:45,502
You're badgering
the witness, counselor.

621
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,190
You're not five words

622
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:50,698
into your cross examination and
you're badgering the witness.

623
00:29:52,084 --> 00:29:53,737
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

624
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:55,740
Let's start again, please.

625
00:29:56,596 --> 00:29:58,065
All right.

626
00:29:59,156 --> 00:30:01,115
Mr. Crawford,

627
00:30:01,565 --> 00:30:03,651
we all heard your testimony,

628
00:30:04,057 --> 00:30:06,026
and it was very moving.

629
00:30:07,294 --> 00:30:09,035
So what now?

630
00:30:10,104 --> 00:30:12,659
Your son is
still dead.

631
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:15,338
Dead from a gunshot wound.

632
00:30:15,441 --> 00:30:17,479
The bullet somehow

633
00:30:17,657 --> 00:30:19,487
found its way into the gun.

634
00:30:19,575 --> 00:30:21,273
You just testified

635
00:30:21,534 --> 00:30:23,536
that you didn't
put it in there.

636
00:30:23,733 --> 00:30:24,952
So,

637
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,792
did Theodore, your oldest son,
put it in there?

638
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,776
Objection.
Calls for speculation.

639
00:30:29,864 --> 00:30:31,857
- Objection sustained. The jury will
- Or could it have been

640
00:30:31,944 --> 00:30:32,997
- disregar...
- your youngest child?

641
00:30:33,084 --> 00:30:34,426
- Maybe he did it?
- Your Honor!

642
00:30:34,514 --> 00:30:38,219
Or was it the gun range fairy,
who always knows

643
00:30:38,307 --> 00:30:39,800
Oh, geez...
Your Honor! what's in your pocket

644
00:30:39,887 --> 00:30:40,809
and loves to make
you think you shot

645
00:30:40,912 --> 00:30:43,660
six bullets
when you only shot five!

646
00:30:44,368 --> 00:30:45,673
That's it!

647
00:30:45,862 --> 00:30:48,213
You have exhausted
my patience.

648
00:30:49,332 --> 00:30:51,848
One more time,
Ms. Glover,

649
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,153
and I will hold you
in contempt.

650
00:30:55,793 --> 00:30:58,395
I have no further questions
for this witness.

651
00:31:03,868 --> 00:31:05,215
Bull...

652
00:31:05,555 --> 00:31:07,989
two of our three green jurors
don't believe him anymore.

653
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:13,926
Any way you can
get a sitter for tonight?

654
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:29,871
As you know, we've been doing
quite a bit of investigating,

655
00:31:29,982 --> 00:31:32,707
getting to know everyone
involved.

656
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,335
And we have a theory

657
00:31:35,423 --> 00:31:38,818
as to who might have put that bullet
in the gun.

658
00:31:39,778 --> 00:31:41,340
Well, unfortunately,
there were no

659
00:31:41,428 --> 00:31:44,278
discernible fingerprints or DNA
on the spent shell casing.

660
00:31:45,511 --> 00:31:48,226
But I did find
something interesting

661
00:31:48,314 --> 00:31:49,723
in Charlie's bedroom.

662
00:31:51,132 --> 00:31:53,074
Okay.
Charlie's notebook.

663
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:54,981
Charlie's World Affairs
notebook.

664
00:31:55,275 --> 00:31:57,918
I'm not clear on what
we're talking about here.

665
00:31:58,006 --> 00:32:00,443
I'm not clear on who
we're talking about here.

666
00:32:00,988 --> 00:32:02,707
If you'll open
the back cover.

667
00:32:07,666 --> 00:32:09,668
Turn the page.

668
00:32:11,436 --> 00:32:14,692
Turn the page.
Turn the page.

669
00:32:20,728 --> 00:32:24,481
What is it you think
we're looking at here?

670
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:27,572
Are-are we having
a conversation about Charlie?

671
00:32:27,884 --> 00:32:30,452
I need to know if we're
talking about Charlie.

672
00:32:31,153 --> 00:32:33,340
We believe Charlie may have been
trying to gain access

673
00:32:33,428 --> 00:32:34,777
to the closet safe.

674
00:32:34,865 --> 00:32:37,192
It appears that, over the course
of several months...

675
00:32:38,495 --> 00:32:40,541
...he tried every conceivable

676
00:32:40,629 --> 00:32:42,121
four-digit combination.

677
00:32:43,023 --> 00:32:45,004
Doing it in a very organized,

678
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:47,379
very systemic way,

679
00:32:47,797 --> 00:32:50,559
and he finally gave up
when he got to the sixes.

680
00:32:51,457 --> 00:32:54,012
Okay, I think you people
are out of your minds.

681
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,147
That's not what this is.
That's not who Charlie is.

682
00:32:57,235 --> 00:32:58,627
There's more.

683
00:32:59,284 --> 00:33:01,324
I've been doing a
fairly exhaustive search

684
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:04,254
online, trying to get a sense
of Charlie's cyber life.

685
00:33:05,028 --> 00:33:08,184
Your son maintained a number
of secret online accounts.

686
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,153
He had dozens
of screen names and profiles.

687
00:33:11,248 --> 00:33:12,763
Okay, so he's a kid.
That's what they do.

688
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:15,176
- They-they live on their devices.
- I found hundreds

689
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,832
of messages in dozens
of private chat rooms,

690
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,012
most of them
about his older brother,

691
00:33:20,394 --> 00:33:23,668
most of them
violent,

692
00:33:24,194 --> 00:33:25,645
dark,

693
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:27,535
disturbing.

694
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:31,184
He was clearly preoccupied
with his brother's death.

695
00:33:35,955 --> 00:33:37,965
Okay. I'm-I'm done here.

696
00:33:38,201 --> 00:33:39,520
This is...

697
00:33:45,432 --> 00:33:47,629
There were also a multitude
of Google searches

698
00:33:47,717 --> 00:33:50,459
on how to load
and shoot revolvers.

699
00:33:50,602 --> 00:33:52,192
Oh, God.

700
00:33:54,474 --> 00:33:57,012
I know how devastating
this is to hear...

701
00:33:59,433 --> 00:34:01,261
...but I would not be
discussing this with you

702
00:34:01,349 --> 00:34:02,723
if I didn't think...

703
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:04,754
If I was not

704
00:34:05,581 --> 00:34:07,504
reasonably certain...

705
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:11,168
I believe
your son is dangerous,

706
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,347
and I believe he intentionally
killed his brother.

707
00:34:16,247 --> 00:34:19,660
Bu... I-I know my son.
He's not a monster.

708
00:34:19,748 --> 00:34:21,706
We did not
raise a killer.

709
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:22,925
If we can just

710
00:34:23,013 --> 00:34:25,059
take a minute
to talk about the case.

711
00:34:25,718 --> 00:34:28,582
By any metric,
we are poised to lose.

712
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,270
And I believe you're facing

713
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:33,621
an extended term
in prison.

714
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,168
Which means
you will be living

715
00:34:35,256 --> 00:34:36,518
alone with Charlie.

716
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:38,981
This is absurd.
My son would never hurt me.

717
00:34:39,069 --> 00:34:40,324
My-my son would never

718
00:34:40,419 --> 00:34:41,458
- hurt anyone.
- What-what...

719
00:34:41,545 --> 00:34:43,004
what are you
suggesting, Jason?

720
00:34:43,092 --> 00:34:45,903
What do we do? Is this something
that-that can be treated?

721
00:34:46,462 --> 00:34:48,121
Something
that can be cured?

722
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:50,070
Cured, no.

723
00:34:50,283 --> 00:34:51,723
There are treatment options

724
00:34:51,811 --> 00:34:54,614
that will
attempt to modify his behavior.

725
00:34:54,702 --> 00:34:56,095
Drugs. But

726
00:34:56,609 --> 00:34:59,306
there's nothing that's gonna fix
the underlying condition.

727
00:34:59,394 --> 00:35:01,543
There is no cure

728
00:35:01,631 --> 00:35:02,981
for sociopathy.

729
00:35:03,069 --> 00:35:06,989
Oh, my God, Eric.
This... this is not who he is. This...

730
00:35:07,077 --> 00:35:08,106
Eric,

731
00:35:08,207 --> 00:35:10,426
Lena,
I have to be honest.

732
00:35:10,514 --> 00:35:12,908
If I could, I would report him
to the authorities.

733
00:35:12,996 --> 00:35:15,145
That's how dangerous
I think he is.

734
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:17,293
But I can't.
No one here can.

735
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:18,619
We're a part of his legal team

736
00:35:18,707 --> 00:35:21,270
and we are bound by
attorney-client privilege.

737
00:35:22,156 --> 00:35:23,462
You can.

738
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,809
You can report him.

739
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,692
You people are insane.

740
00:35:36,657 --> 00:35:38,301
Eric, I want to go.

741
00:35:42,342 --> 00:35:45,801
Eric.
I need to go.

742
00:36:08,284 --> 00:36:10,004
You write a closing argument?

743
00:36:11,442 --> 00:36:12,535
I did.

744
00:36:12,623 --> 00:36:13,918
Think it'll make a difference?

745
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:15,278
None whatsoever.

746
00:36:16,223 --> 00:36:17,489
This is a first.

747
00:36:17,585 --> 00:36:19,935
I think I've been outsmarted
by a 13-year-old.

748
00:36:20,038 --> 00:36:21,213
Well...

749
00:36:21,332 --> 00:36:23,621
it's not like we had
a lot to work with.

750
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,809
Two witnesses.

751
00:36:25,897 --> 00:36:29,059
One dead, the other
a pathological liar.

752
00:36:33,231 --> 00:36:34,699
He is, isn't he?

753
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,856
What's that?

754
00:36:37,586 --> 00:36:38,965
Our client.

755
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:40,809
Our original client, Charlie,

756
00:36:40,897 --> 00:36:42,262
the one we were hired
to defend...

757
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:44,114
He's a pathological liar.

758
00:36:45,752 --> 00:36:47,949
Mr. and Mrs. Crawford.

759
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:51,554
Any chance I can speak
to you two in private?

760
00:36:51,773 --> 00:36:54,582
I've secured the courthouse
conference room.

761
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:57,058
Not to worry,
I'll sit with Charlie.

762
00:37:10,129 --> 00:37:11,613
What's going on?

763
00:37:12,782 --> 00:37:14,504
Nothing to worry about.

764
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,686
What you playing?
What game is that?

765
00:37:18,522 --> 00:37:21,584
Wh-What-what is Mr. Colón
telling my parents?

766
00:37:22,072 --> 00:37:24,686
Is everything all right?
Has something changed?

767
00:37:25,879 --> 00:37:27,837
I don't want to get
your hopes up.

768
00:37:28,089 --> 00:37:30,764
Tell me.
Please.

769
00:37:31,246 --> 00:37:32,881
Charlie...

770
00:37:35,413 --> 00:37:37,951
Well, there's a new

771
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:39,748
kind of technology

772
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:41,695
we found out about

773
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:43,982
from the Netherlands.

774
00:37:44,828 --> 00:37:45,818
What happens is these

775
00:37:45,906 --> 00:37:47,498
forensic clinicians
discovered a way

776
00:37:47,586 --> 00:37:50,037
of soaking spent shell casings
in a chemical,

777
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:52,397
and apparently they
were able to extract DNA

778
00:37:52,485 --> 00:37:54,529
that we've never
been able to before.

779
00:37:54,643 --> 00:37:56,154
So...

780
00:37:56,788 --> 00:37:58,703
So what does that mean?

781
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:02,404
It means, if it works...

782
00:38:02,651 --> 00:38:04,201
And everybody seems
to think it will...

783
00:38:04,289 --> 00:38:07,068
We should be able to tell who
loaded the bullet into the gun

784
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:09,318
that killed your brother.

785
00:38:12,362 --> 00:38:14,451
Look, it came out
of a fresh box of ammo.

786
00:38:14,539 --> 00:38:17,092
There's no reason for anyone
else to have touched it, right?

787
00:38:19,225 --> 00:38:22,857
So I have someone who works
for me

788
00:38:22,945 --> 00:38:25,881
flying to the Netherlands
with the casing as we speak.

789
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,232
But it's no guarantee.

790
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:35,315
Look, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything.

791
00:38:35,722 --> 00:38:38,264
If for some reason it doesn't
work, I got your hopes up.

792
00:38:38,352 --> 00:38:39,631
Dr. Bull.

793
00:38:41,772 --> 00:38:44,053
You're still
part of my legal team, right?

794
00:38:44,591 --> 00:38:46,318
Anything I tell you

795
00:38:46,406 --> 00:38:48,615
stays a secret, doesn't it?

796
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,631
Yes, of course.

797
00:38:54,006 --> 00:38:57,373
What would happen if they found
my DNA on that shell casing?

798
00:38:59,705 --> 00:39:01,403
Charlie Crawford,
Eric Crawford's

799
00:39:01,491 --> 00:39:03,449
surviving son, confessed to me

800
00:39:04,292 --> 00:39:06,209
that he intentionally
murdered

801
00:39:06,297 --> 00:39:07,951
his older brother.

802
00:39:08,481 --> 00:39:10,419
He explained that
when his brother went

803
00:39:10,507 --> 00:39:12,251
to see if his parents
had arrived home early,

804
00:39:12,338 --> 00:39:14,514
he, Charlie, loaded the gun,

805
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:17,696
and when his brother returned to
tell him they were still alone,

806
00:39:17,784 --> 00:39:19,436
Charlie shot him in the head

807
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,483
and made it look like
an accident.

808
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:24,912
Your Honor,
even if that were true,

809
00:39:25,817 --> 00:39:28,514
Dr. Bull is part of
Charlie Crawford's legal team.

810
00:39:28,602 --> 00:39:30,193
That confession is privileged.

811
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:31,482
Normally, it would be.

812
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:34,162
But the one thing that trumps
attorney-client privilege

813
00:39:34,376 --> 00:39:35,682
is perjury.

814
00:39:35,996 --> 00:39:37,563
He's right.

815
00:39:37,752 --> 00:39:39,623
Charlie Crawford was

816
00:39:39,726 --> 00:39:41,303
your first witness.

817
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,451
On the stand, under oath,

818
00:39:43,539 --> 00:39:46,178
he said his brother's death
was an accident,

819
00:39:46,487 --> 00:39:49,620
caused because someone
left a loaded gun

820
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,639
where children
could access it.

821
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,592
That's a direct

822
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,928
contradiction from what
he confessed to Dr. Bull today,

823
00:39:58,017 --> 00:39:59,404
and that's perjury.

824
00:40:01,646 --> 00:40:04,248
So what are you asking me
to do?

825
00:40:05,082 --> 00:40:07,606
Well, there is only one remedy
for perjured testimony,

826
00:40:07,763 --> 00:40:09,092
that it be struck
from the record,

827
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,482
and if you strike
this testimony,

828
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:12,842
the government has no case

829
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:14,179
because there's
no one to testify

830
00:40:14,266 --> 00:40:17,139
the gun must have been loaded
when Theo took it from the safe

831
00:40:17,227 --> 00:40:19,857
because, frankly,
it wasn't.

832
00:40:24,016 --> 00:40:26,932
So what do we do
about this boy?

833
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:29,014
Where is he?

834
00:40:29,102 --> 00:40:30,626
He's sitting in the hallway
with his parents,

835
00:40:30,713 --> 00:40:33,561
who have no idea
what their son told me

836
00:40:33,649 --> 00:40:35,738
or that I am in here
discussing it with you.

837
00:40:40,043 --> 00:40:41,412
We charge him,

838
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,100
with perjury,

839
00:40:45,213 --> 00:40:46,482
with murder.

840
00:40:48,801 --> 00:40:50,701
Are you gonna
take him into custody?

841
00:40:52,905 --> 00:40:54,295
May I come with you?

842
00:40:57,532 --> 00:40:58,678
Mr. Colón,

843
00:40:59,813 --> 00:41:02,207
will you join me
in the courtroom, please?

844
00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:03,975
Your second chair is here?

845
00:41:04,078 --> 00:41:05,943
Yes, Your Honor. Al right.

846
00:41:06,044 --> 00:41:07,623
Let's go in there.

847
00:41:08,386 --> 00:41:11,240
I'll dismiss the charges
against Eric Crawford,

848
00:41:11,537 --> 00:41:13,539
and I'll discharge the jury.

849
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:23,826
Well.

850
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:27,393
I guess there's no time
like the present.

851
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:29,475
I'm so sorry.

852
00:41:29,563 --> 00:41:31,920
I haven't been
getting much sleep.

853
00:41:32,182 --> 00:41:35,447
Well, I don't know
what my excuse is.

854
00:41:36,574 --> 00:41:38,097
You're human.

855
00:41:46,531 --> 00:41:47,764
You okay?

856
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,756
They wouldn't even talk to me.

857
00:41:51,237 --> 00:41:53,239
Wouldn't even
look at me.

858
00:41:54,331 --> 00:41:56,475
Aw, come on, Bull.

859
00:41:57,623 --> 00:41:59,639
You didn't have a choice.

860
00:42:00,155 --> 00:42:02,873
Couldn't let your
friend go to prison

861
00:42:02,961 --> 00:42:04,115
for something he didn't do,

862
00:42:04,203 --> 00:42:05,780
and you couldn't leave
a dangerous kid like that

863
00:42:05,867 --> 00:42:07,375
on the street.

864
00:42:08,407 --> 00:42:10,967
That dangerous kid
was their child.

865
00:42:11,707 --> 00:42:13,209
Their only child.

866
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:16,559
You didn't have
a choice.

867
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,115
This parenting thing.

868
00:42:21,822 --> 00:42:23,217
I don't know, Benny.

869

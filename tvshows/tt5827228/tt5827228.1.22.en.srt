00:01:39,214 --> 00:01:41,065
<i>The building has a gym,</i>

3
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,359
a bike room, a party room,

4
00:01:43,361 --> 00:01:45,688
high-speed Internet and a rooftop pool.

5
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,131
And if you're prepared to pay

6
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:49,211
all cash, Dr. Bull, I think we can take

7
00:01:49,213 --> 00:01:52,327
this lovely home off the market today.

8
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:53,990
I got to say,

9
00:01:53,997 --> 00:01:56,121
it's not at all what I had in mind.

10
00:01:56,123 --> 00:01:58,333
There are nine other people
bidding on this apartment.

11
00:01:58,335 --> 00:01:59,334
I know.

12
00:01:59,336 --> 00:02:01,202
I-I want to have, like,

13
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:05,807
a open beam ceiling,
books everywhere, a dog,

14
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:08,339
roaring blaze in the fireplace,

15
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:10,078
maybe a pond.

16
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,613
- A pond?
- Yeah.

17
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:13,781
Dr. Bull, this is New York City.

18
00:02:13,783 --> 00:02:15,617
- We don't do ponds.
- Excuse me.

19
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:16,751
Thoreau here.

20
00:02:16,753 --> 00:02:19,854
Hey. Where am I finding you,
Walden Pond?

21
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:23,091
I'm just doing that senseless thing

22
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:26,828
looking for an apartment.

23
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,196
I thought you already had an apartment.

24
00:02:28,198 --> 00:02:29,464
I do,

25
00:02:29,466 --> 00:02:30,832
but it's cold and modern

26
00:02:30,834 --> 00:02:34,502
and looks like it belongs
to Bane from the Batman movies.

27
00:02:34,504 --> 00:02:36,037
- Mm.
- Truth is,

28
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:38,006
most nights I sleep in the office.

29
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:39,607
But that's probably more
than you want to know.

30
00:02:39,609 --> 00:02:40,808
Way more.

31
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,377
- What's up?
- Well, I was wondering

32
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:44,444
if you felt like dinner.

33
00:02:44,446 --> 00:02:45,647
What were you thinking?

34
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:48,735
Anywhere but Third Avenue.

35
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:52,320
Scary, isn't it?

36
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:54,055
You guys are three blocks away.

37
00:02:54,057 --> 00:02:55,990
Did you see it? Did you hear it?

38
00:02:55,992 --> 00:02:57,625
Building shook.

39
00:02:57,627 --> 00:02:59,788
But the phones kept ringing, and...

40
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,624
work kept getting done.

41
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:05,085
Like nothing happened.

42
00:03:06,136 --> 00:03:08,503
Kind of amazing what we've become.

43
00:03:10,307 --> 00:03:11,713
All right, dinner.

44
00:03:11,715 --> 00:03:14,042
But only because you're forcing me.

45
00:03:15,478 --> 00:03:17,812
Heptex Corporation,

46
00:03:17,814 --> 00:03:20,181
largest computer cloud service
in the world.

47
00:03:20,183 --> 00:03:23,117
The company's owner, Garrett Tilden,

48
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,119
is my oldest client.

49
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,488
Just after lunch today,
the FBI paid him a visit.

50
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,442
They're starting to suspect

51
00:03:29,444 --> 00:03:31,349
the blast this morning
was the work of a group

52
00:03:31,351 --> 00:03:32,897
of eco-terrorists.

53
00:03:32,898 --> 00:03:35,599
The hotel ballroom they bombed
was hosting a symposium

54
00:03:35,601 --> 00:03:37,634
on how to maximize profits

55
00:03:37,636 --> 00:03:40,427
in a world of ecological deregulation.

56
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:42,339
I missed the part where you explained

57
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:44,207
what this has to do with me.

58
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:47,010
Well, they presented
my client with a warrant

59
00:03:47,012 --> 00:03:49,646
seeking to seize any and all data files

60
00:03:49,648 --> 00:03:51,515
pertaining to the listed groups,

61
00:03:51,517 --> 00:03:53,917
all of whom are suspected
of trafficking in eco-terror.

62
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,285
Okay.

63
00:03:55,287 --> 00:03:57,854
All of these groups
make use of Heptex clouds.

64
00:03:57,856 --> 00:04:00,424
Every website they visit,
every cell call they make,

65
00:04:00,426 --> 00:04:01,925
every text and e-mail they send

66
00:04:01,927 --> 00:04:03,827
is believed to have been recorded

67
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:05,796
or catalogued on a Heptex server.

68
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,065
How convenient.

69
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:10,667
The FBI wants access to these servers.

70
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:11,968
Of course they do.

71
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:16,020
And for the moment,
my client is refusing to comply.

72
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,207
<i>So here's the thing.</i>

73
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:19,276
I've thought about it
for a whole 25 minutes,

74
00:04:19,278 --> 00:04:22,179
and I think your client's wrong.

75
00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:24,481
He ought to turn over those servers.

76
00:04:24,483 --> 00:04:27,517
Funny, I don't recall
asking for your opinion.

77
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,629
I do recall you owing me three cases.

78
00:04:31,128 --> 00:04:33,000
You said you were scared on the phone.

79
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,525
Don't you want them to catch these guys?

80
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:36,927
Of course I do.

81
00:04:36,929 --> 00:04:38,562
But my client is worried.

82
00:04:38,564 --> 00:04:40,397
If the government can demand to see

83
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,433
where people they think might be
bad guys have gone on the Web,

84
00:04:43,435 --> 00:04:45,268
what's to stop them
from demanding to see

85
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,105
that same information about you or me?

86
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:50,774
What's my name?

87
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,943
- Bull.
- Right.

88
00:04:52,945 --> 00:04:54,277
Don't bull a Bull.

89
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,929
Your client's trying to convince you

90
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:57,481
that he's wrapping himself
up in the flag,

91
00:04:57,483 --> 00:04:59,783
when this is really about money.

92
00:04:59,785 --> 00:05:02,018
He's worried that
if he gives up those servers,

93
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,055
people are gonna stop using his service.

94
00:05:05,057 --> 00:05:07,924
My advice?
Tell him to give up the servers.

95
00:05:07,926 --> 00:05:09,326
No one's ever gonna find out.

96
00:05:09,328 --> 00:05:10,794
FBI's not gonna say anything.

97
00:05:10,796 --> 00:05:12,395
It's not in their self-interest.

98
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:14,598
And if he decides to kick up a fuss,

99
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,566
it's gonna be all over the media.

100
00:05:16,568 --> 00:05:18,768
And half the country, the half like me

101
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,804
that doesn't want to get blown up

102
00:05:20,806 --> 00:05:22,506
'cause they're in the wrong
place at the wrong time,

103
00:05:22,508 --> 00:05:24,708
they're gonna be very mad at him
for not sharing what he knows.

104
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,409
Thanks for dinner.

105
00:05:27,646 --> 00:05:30,647
He's not my client anymore.

106
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:32,449
He's ours.

107
00:05:32,451 --> 00:05:35,868
I'm entitled to three cases
worth of services from you

108
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,654
and your company.

109
00:05:37,656 --> 00:05:39,689
And you don't get to pick the cases.

110
00:05:40,115 --> 00:05:41,458
So...

111
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,859
leave your id at home,

112
00:05:42,861 --> 00:05:45,395
and meet me at my office
tomorrow morning at 9:00,

113
00:05:45,397 --> 00:05:47,956
and we can figure out how to proceed.

114
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:52,302
I had a nice time at dinner, too,

115
00:05:52,304 --> 00:05:53,904
by the way.

116
00:05:53,906 --> 00:05:55,972
It's too late. You blew it.

117
00:05:55,974 --> 00:05:57,974
I'm not inviting you
back to the Batcave.

118
00:05:57,976 --> 00:05:59,176
9:00.

119
00:05:59,178 --> 00:06:01,444
Don't beg. It doesn't become you.

That's not funny.

122
00:06:18,103 --> 00:06:19,863
Take that off.

123
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,942
I never said I didn't want you to speak.

124
00:06:25,944 --> 00:06:27,911
Now, come on. They're
gonna be here any minute.

125
00:06:27,913 --> 00:06:29,546
Ms. Nunnelly,

126
00:06:29,548 --> 00:06:31,247
they're on their way in.

127
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:32,792
Oh.

128
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,251
Ooh, that's a tough one.

129
00:06:36,944 --> 00:06:39,923
Garrett Tilden, Harry Kemp,
this is Dr. Jason Bull,

130
00:06:39,925 --> 00:06:42,025
the gentleman I told
you about on the phone.

131
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,259
Nice to meet you guys.

132
00:06:43,261 --> 00:06:44,627
You all right there?

133
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:45,762
Yeah. It's nothing.

134
00:06:45,764 --> 00:06:47,597
It's a little rash I picked up.

135
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:48,932
Some kind of Brazilian thing.

136
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:50,433
Not contagious.

137
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:54,904
Uh, well, let's get
right to it, shall we?

138
00:06:56,274 --> 00:06:59,542
I had my staff watch
all the morning shows

139
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,077
and check all the morning papers

140
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,078
and their websites.

141
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,513
No one is mentioning Heptex.

142
00:07:03,515 --> 00:07:04,981
Not yet.

143
00:07:04,983 --> 00:07:07,150
Of course, the FBI is still
hoping you'll play ball,

144
00:07:07,152 --> 00:07:09,018
and they can do this
without anyone knowing.

145
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,088
But trust me, if you don't
surrender that data today,

146
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,156
somebody is gonna

147
00:07:13,158 --> 00:07:14,858
leak that information,
and they are gonna

148
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,094
use public opinion
to shame you into doing it.

149
00:07:18,797 --> 00:07:20,763
I already gave them the data.

150
00:07:20,765 --> 00:07:22,801
This morning, before we headed over.

151
00:07:24,636 --> 00:07:25,835
I'm confused.

152
00:07:25,837 --> 00:07:27,303
It's encrypted.

153
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:29,939
They won't be able to read it,
not without an encryption key.

154
00:07:29,941 --> 00:07:31,040
It's a piece of code.

155
00:07:31,042 --> 00:07:33,176
Mr. Tilden and I are
the only ones who know it.

156
00:07:33,178 --> 00:07:34,144
I'm sorry.

157
00:07:34,146 --> 00:07:35,445
Harry is my number two.

158
00:07:35,447 --> 00:07:37,247
Most brilliant mind
I've ever encountered.

159
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,282
Programming, business, all of it.

160
00:07:39,284 --> 00:07:40,569
Future of our company.

161
00:07:41,486 --> 00:07:45,688
You gave the United States
government encrypted data?

162
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,557
We figured it would buy us some time,

163
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:48,825
probably a day or so,

164
00:07:48,827 --> 00:07:51,628
so we could come over here
and come up with a game plan.

165
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,762
Hey, I've got a plan.

166
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,063
Give them the key.

167
00:07:54,065 --> 00:07:56,671
Excuse me. That's not the plan.

168
00:07:56,673 --> 00:07:58,902
That's not an option
we've even discussed.

169
00:07:58,904 --> 00:08:01,070
Well, it's either that
or we go to trial.

170
00:08:01,072 --> 00:08:02,772
And that would be your company

171
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,507
versus the United States of America.

172
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:07,177
And as big and powerful and brilliant

173
00:08:07,179 --> 00:08:08,545
as you are,

174
00:08:08,547 --> 00:08:11,147
the other guy is bigger and richer,

175
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:13,616
and has many more resources.

176
00:08:14,477 --> 00:08:16,419
Here's how I look at it.

177
00:08:16,421 --> 00:08:19,022
The second the government
said they wanted our data,

178
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:20,490
we were screwed.

179
00:08:20,492 --> 00:08:21,925
We sell security.

180
00:08:21,927 --> 00:08:24,961
We tell the public, we tell
the world to give us your data.

181
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,421
We'll keep it safe and sound,

182
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,870
and no one will ever see it.

183
00:08:27,872 --> 00:08:31,201
I comply with this warrant,
and I'm out of business.

184
00:08:31,203 --> 00:08:33,503
- But if I fight it...
- As long as we're in court,

185
00:08:33,505 --> 00:08:35,838
we'll be getting millions
of dollars of free publicity

186
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,407
every day, reminding the world

187
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:39,175
that we do not give up
their information.

188
00:08:39,177 --> 00:08:40,910
Not to the FBI.

189
00:08:40,912 --> 00:08:42,213
Not to anyone.

190
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:46,482
Well, I guess we have
our marching orders, then.

191
00:08:49,906 --> 00:08:51,221
Publicity.

192
00:08:51,223 --> 00:08:54,591
You know, it's interesting;
on the news this morning,

193
00:08:54,593 --> 00:08:57,527
I heard "two dead, 11 injured."

194
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:00,496
And it just... it seems...

195
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,218
I mean, I understand
your point of view, but...

196
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,800
I didn't set that bomb, Dr. Bull,

197
00:09:03,802 --> 00:09:04,968
and I have no idea who did.

198
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,774
But I have 22,000 employees
all around the world

199
00:09:08,776 --> 00:09:10,647
who are dependent on me for a paycheck,

200
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:12,609
and they've done nothing wrong.

201
00:09:12,611 --> 00:09:14,477
I've done nothing wrong.

202
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:16,579
And I live in
the United States of America,

203
00:09:16,581 --> 00:09:18,548
a place where, if you do nothing wrong,

204
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,649
you shouldn't be punished.

205
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:21,618
Not to mention, you are guaranteed

206
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,381
a right to personal privacy.

207
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,589
Agreed.

208
00:09:26,591 --> 00:09:28,758
When J.P. told me you
were joining us this morning,

209
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,193
I did my due diligence.

210
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:33,196
I know who you are
and I know what you do.

211
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,665
I'd like to have you
on the team, Dr. Bull,

212
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:37,463
but if you don't want to be here...

213
00:09:37,465 --> 00:09:39,535
He wants to be here.

214
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,366
Good. I'll let you know as soon as

215
00:09:41,368 --> 00:09:42,952
the government serves us
with a second warrant

216
00:09:42,954 --> 00:09:44,412
to provide an encryption key.

217
00:09:44,414 --> 00:09:46,152
Fantastic.

218
00:09:50,148 --> 00:09:52,181
Did I do something wrong?

219
00:09:54,653 --> 00:09:56,719
Speculation continues that the bomb,

220
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,389
apparently a homemade explosive
of some sort,

221
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:02,592
was set by a member
or members of what are called

222
00:10:02,594 --> 00:10:03,926
eco-terror groups,

223
00:10:03,928 --> 00:10:06,029
though no group has yet
claimed responsibility.

224
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:09,332
Frightening. Really frightening.

225
00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:11,778
I must have eaten at that hotel
five, six times, maybe.

226
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,503
I walk by it every time I go to work.

227
00:10:13,505 --> 00:10:15,305
Hey. Good news, team.

228
00:10:15,307 --> 00:10:16,906
We have just been hired

229
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:19,242
by one of the biggest companies
in the world.

230
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,411
Heptex Corporation wants us

231
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:24,147
to help them defend their liberty.

232
00:10:27,018 --> 00:10:28,551
Their liberty?

233
00:10:28,553 --> 00:10:31,054
Who's threatening their liberty?

234
00:10:31,056 --> 00:10:33,156
Well, it's a pesky
little outfit called the FBI.

235
00:10:33,158 --> 00:10:35,291
They seem to think
that Heptex may have information

236
00:10:35,293 --> 00:10:37,226
that will help them
figure out who's responsible

237
00:10:37,228 --> 00:10:39,462
for that bombing at the hotel yesterday.

238
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,050
Call me crazy, but I sense
some discord in the room.

239
00:10:49,052 --> 00:10:51,674
Well, and I'm only speaking for myself,

240
00:10:51,676 --> 00:10:54,644
but it feels like perhaps
we belong on the other side

241
00:10:54,646 --> 00:10:56,512
of this particular conflict.

242
00:10:56,514 --> 00:10:57,947
Does it?

243
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,248
Hmm.

244
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,284
We're professionals...

245
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,820
professionals for hire...
and we don't always get

246
00:11:03,822 --> 00:11:05,788
to choose who hires us.

247
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,523
Or what side we're on.

248
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:10,104
But everyone deserves
a vigorous defense.

249
00:11:10,106 --> 00:11:11,724
We know that.

250
00:11:11,726 --> 00:11:14,364
But usually... at least
since I've known you...

251
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:16,132
you've always seemed...

252
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,900
particular about the kind of cases

253
00:11:17,902 --> 00:11:19,836
that you've gotten involved with.

254
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,773
You're assuming you know
my point of view on this.

255
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,508
This is about the right to privacy.

256
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,777
Aren't Americans entitled to that?

257
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:30,215
Aren't corporations
that abide by the law

258
00:11:30,217 --> 00:11:31,547
entitled to that?

259
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:33,516
Of course they are, Bull.

260
00:11:33,518 --> 00:11:36,853
It's just...
this happened a block from us.

261
00:11:36,855 --> 00:11:38,955
Everyone's just a little... raw,

262
00:11:38,957 --> 00:11:40,934
a little tender from this whole thing.

263
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,770
All right.

264
00:11:44,562 --> 00:11:46,329
Understood.

265
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,865
Now... let's put together
some mock juries.

266
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:51,167
I want some privacy advocates,
and I want some people

267
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,002
who believe that rights are something

268
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,438
that can be given up
if it is for the greater good.

269
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,639
You got it.

270
00:11:56,641 --> 00:11:59,208
Okay. I'll work on
some speculative arguments

271
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,077
- for counsel to consider.
- Excellent.

272
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:02,612
- Danny.
- Yeah?

273
00:12:02,614 --> 00:12:04,313
I've got two names for you.

274
00:12:04,315 --> 00:12:04,783
Okay.

275
00:12:04,785 --> 00:12:08,184
Gary Tilden and Harry Kemp.

276
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:11,954
Tilden is founder and CEO of Heptex.

277
00:12:11,956 --> 00:12:14,023
And Kemp is his right hand.

278
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,526
Our clients. You want me
to investigate our clients?

279
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:18,461
Well, I didn't pick them.

280
00:12:18,463 --> 00:12:19,896
They didn't pick me.

281
00:12:19,898 --> 00:12:22,331
Sort of a shotgun marriage
arranged by lead counsel.

282
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:25,435
Oh. And who is lead counsel?

283
00:12:27,772 --> 00:12:30,106
That would be...

284
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:31,674
J.P. Nunnelly.

285
00:12:31,676 --> 00:12:33,576
J.P. Nunnelly?

286
00:12:37,198 --> 00:12:38,247
What?

287
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,183
I didn't say anything.

288
00:12:40,869 --> 00:12:42,585
Lead counsel on this case

289
00:12:42,587 --> 00:12:44,954
is J.P. Nunnelly.

290
00:12:44,956 --> 00:12:46,222
- Oh, what a surprise.
- She's great.

291
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,256
We love her.

292
00:12:47,258 --> 00:12:48,524
- Saved my ass.
- Yeah.

293
00:12:57,869 --> 00:13:00,169
What do you know about encryption,

294
00:13:00,171 --> 00:13:01,804
encryption keys?

295
00:13:01,806 --> 00:13:03,246
Oh, everything.

296
00:13:03,248 --> 00:13:04,493
Don't be so modest.

297
00:13:04,495 --> 00:13:06,615
It sort of has to do
with the level of encryption

298
00:13:06,617 --> 00:13:08,454
and the volume of the data
that's been encrypted.

299
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:10,146
But here's the bottom line:

300
00:13:10,148 --> 00:13:13,449
no matter how complex the encryption,

301
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:15,618
no matter how voluminous the data,

302
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,554
there's always someone, somewhere,

303
00:13:18,556 --> 00:13:21,824
who, given the necessary amount of time

304
00:13:21,826 --> 00:13:24,927
and proper skill set, can break through.

305
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,662
And would you know where to find

306
00:13:26,664 --> 00:13:28,664
any of the people who can do that?

307
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:29,959
I might.

308
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:32,268
I'm guessing this is for Heptex?

309
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,503
Well...

310
00:13:34,756 --> 00:13:36,172
Well, then I can't.

311
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,076
Excuse me?

312
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:40,343
A guy in my building
got caught in that blast.

313
00:13:40,345 --> 00:13:41,711
Burned his face.

314
00:13:41,713 --> 00:13:43,446
He's in the hospital now.

315
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,616
I'm sorry, Cable.

316
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:48,017
Were you close?

317
00:13:48,853 --> 00:13:50,820
He lived in my building.

318
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:54,657
So you won't do this?

319
00:13:57,262 --> 00:13:58,928
Not for them.

320
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,897
Well, it wouldn't be for them;
they have keys.

321
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:02,098
It would be for me,

322
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,766
assuming that I can get access

323
00:14:03,768 --> 00:14:06,435
to the relevant data
on the relevant servers,

324
00:14:06,437 --> 00:14:08,738
which is also
why I would need your help.

325
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,146
Sounds like you don't
trust your clients.

326
00:14:10,148 --> 00:14:12,108
I don't know my clients, not yet.

327
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:15,545
Will you help me with this?

328
00:14:15,547 --> 00:14:18,981
I'm sorry, Dr. Bull, I can't.

329
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,883
Really? Why not?

330
00:14:20,885 --> 00:14:24,820
Actually, I'm not feeling very well.

331
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,356
Cable!

332
00:14:27,358 --> 00:14:29,058
Aren't you a little concerned

333
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,427
you won't have a job when you come back?

334
00:14:43,364 --> 00:14:45,697
Wow. Very cool.

335
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:50,120
So, all those people are
gonna listen to my arguments?

336
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,803
That is the idea.

337
00:14:51,805 --> 00:14:53,205
You get to audition your case,

338
00:14:53,207 --> 00:14:56,308
and we get reactions from the mock jury.

339
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,704
Biometrics in real time,

340
00:14:58,706 --> 00:15:01,380
individual and focus group interviews.

341
00:15:01,905 --> 00:15:03,782
You're a really smart man, Mr. Bull.

342
00:15:03,784 --> 00:15:06,652
Can you say that again, slower?

343
00:15:06,654 --> 00:15:08,887
I'm having trouble following you.

344
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:11,323
You're also very funny.

345
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:13,258
Well, it's part of the service.

346
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,993
Another thing we like to do at TAC

347
00:15:14,995 --> 00:15:17,663
is we find out <i>everything</i> we can

348
00:15:17,665 --> 00:15:19,464
about the other side.

349
00:15:19,466 --> 00:15:21,266
Well... yeah.

350
00:15:21,946 --> 00:15:24,336
Good. I'm glad
we see eye to eye on that.

351
00:15:24,338 --> 00:15:26,071
That is why I think

352
00:15:26,073 --> 00:15:29,107
you should ask your client
to give us a copy of the server

353
00:15:29,109 --> 00:15:30,776
he surrendered to the FBI.

354
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:33,596
The encrypted one, that no one can read?

355
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:34,660
That'd be the one.

356
00:15:34,662 --> 00:15:35,747
And now that we're all on the same team,

357
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:36,982
maybe they can give us a key.

358
00:15:38,352 --> 00:15:39,885
Why?

359
00:15:39,887 --> 00:15:41,720
Why do we need the server?

360
00:15:41,722 --> 00:15:44,856
So that we can know
as much as the other guys,

361
00:15:44,858 --> 00:15:46,391
and maybe more.

362
00:15:47,528 --> 00:15:48,827
Hmm.

363
00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:50,562
Again, it's encrypted.

364
00:15:50,564 --> 00:15:52,794
The FBI doesn't have the key.

365
00:15:52,796 --> 00:15:54,366
My client won't give them the key,

366
00:15:54,368 --> 00:15:56,234
which is why we're going to court.

367
00:15:56,236 --> 00:15:57,803
Again, it's the FBI.

368
00:15:57,805 --> 00:16:00,939
And trust me, they are going
to crack that thing open.

369
00:16:00,941 --> 00:16:03,008
And when they do,
they're not gonna send us

370
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,477
a sweet little e-mail
to tell us about it.

371
00:16:07,381 --> 00:16:09,414
Why do you really want it?

372
00:16:09,744 --> 00:16:11,850
Don't you trust
the people we're working for?

373
00:16:12,455 --> 00:16:13,485
Do you?

374
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:15,353
Why are you afraid

375
00:16:15,355 --> 00:16:16,342
to ask them for it?

376
00:16:17,168 --> 00:16:18,590
Anything you discover

377
00:16:18,592 --> 00:16:21,031
is protected under
attorney-client privilege.

378
00:16:21,033 --> 00:16:23,395
Are you afraid of
what you're going to discover?

379
00:16:23,397 --> 00:16:25,664
I like to know who I'm working for.

380
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,866
Well, I know who you're working for.

381
00:16:27,868 --> 00:16:29,735
You're working for me.

382
00:16:30,181 --> 00:16:33,138
And here's what you need
to know: I like to win.

383
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,408
And I don't sense you're
helping me to do that right now.

384
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,943
Well, finding out what's really

385
00:16:37,945 --> 00:16:40,378
going on here isn't gonna
stop you from winning.

386
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,848
What are you talking about,
"what's really going on here"?

387
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,851
It's very simple:
the government is overreaching.

388
00:16:45,853 --> 00:16:48,920
We have a right to privacy;
it's in the Constitution, Bull.

389
00:16:48,922 --> 00:16:50,756
There's nothing
in the Constitution that says

390
00:16:50,758 --> 00:16:52,724
if you know who killed someone,

391
00:16:52,726 --> 00:16:55,260
you have a right
to keep that to yourself.

392
00:17:00,601 --> 00:17:02,067
Whew.

393
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:04,402
I hate it when Mom and Dad fight.

394
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:05,904
<i>Really?</i>

395
00:17:05,906 --> 00:17:07,239
That's what you think this is about?

396
00:17:07,241 --> 00:17:09,307
Some higher principle
that puts your client

397
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:10,542
above the greater good?

398
00:17:10,544 --> 00:17:12,477
Well, I'm sorry, neither of those guys

399
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:14,546
reminds me of Thomas Jefferson.

400
00:17:14,548 --> 00:17:17,949
Really? And who appointed you
to the court, Mr. Bull?

401
00:17:17,951 --> 00:17:20,270
And just so we're clear,
I actually do believe

402
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,343
that this is an idea worth fighting for.

403
00:17:22,345 --> 00:17:24,456
And I'm not saying that they
don't have some other reason

404
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:27,404
for doing what they're doing,
but that's not my problem.

405
00:17:27,406 --> 00:17:29,828
There is a point of law to argue here,

406
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,463
and I have been hired to argue it.

407
00:17:31,465 --> 00:17:33,431
And I don't need to look
at those servers

408
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:35,200
to know whether or not
I'm doing the right thing!

409
00:17:35,202 --> 00:17:36,201
Mm-hmm.

410
00:17:36,203 --> 00:17:39,571
We are, uh... ready downstairs.

411
00:17:39,573 --> 00:17:41,573
Thank you, Benny.

412
00:18:38,165 --> 00:18:39,564
Good evening, young lady.

413
00:18:39,566 --> 00:18:41,166
What can I do for you?

414
00:18:41,168 --> 00:18:43,735
Well, my boss just called me,
woke me up,

415
00:18:43,737 --> 00:18:46,571
said he needed a flash drive for
this meeting that he's having.

416
00:18:46,573 --> 00:18:48,840
Um, I was gonna run it up to him.

417
00:18:48,842 --> 00:18:50,208
You have I.D.?

418
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,977
Yeah. One sec.

419
00:18:56,357 --> 00:18:57,582
And your boss's name?

420
00:18:57,584 --> 00:18:59,184
Uh, Harry Kemp.

421
00:18:59,186 --> 00:19:01,653
Huh, what do you know. He signed
in two minutes before you did.

422
00:19:01,655 --> 00:19:03,488
You know where you're going?

423
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,423
Actually, uh, I don't.

424
00:19:05,425 --> 00:19:07,959
5211, 52nd floor.

425
00:19:07,961 --> 00:19:09,661
Elevator's on your right.

426
00:19:09,663 --> 00:19:10,929
5211.

427
00:19:36,535 --> 00:19:38,736
The Foresight Foundry?

428
00:19:49,469 --> 00:19:51,736
Benjamin?

429
00:19:56,209 --> 00:19:57,943
Nice office.

430
00:19:57,945 --> 00:19:59,411
It's all about the views.

431
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:01,613
How are things at Homeland Security?

432
00:20:01,615 --> 00:20:03,548
You're alive, right?

433
00:20:04,895 --> 00:20:06,318
Keep up the good work.

434
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,986
What can I do for you, Benjamin?

435
00:20:07,988 --> 00:20:09,921
It's about the Midtown Hotel bombing.

436
00:20:09,923 --> 00:20:11,589
I need a favor.

437
00:20:13,327 --> 00:20:15,727
I need a copy of the Heptex server.

438
00:20:19,744 --> 00:20:21,032
No problem.

439
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:22,734
What else you want?

440
00:20:22,736 --> 00:20:24,536
Osama bin Laden's pillbox?

441
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:26,842
John Wilkes Booth's gun?
Just name it, Benny,

442
00:20:26,844 --> 00:20:28,373
I'll put it in your shopping cart.

443
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,008
You know how long
it took me to get out here?

444
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,076
I need it.

445
00:20:31,078 --> 00:20:33,678
And your buddies in Justice,
they owe me.

446
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,313
They messed me around really good

447
00:20:35,315 --> 00:20:36,982
with that Hayden Watkins case.

448
00:20:36,984 --> 00:20:40,018
You know it's a paperweight, right?

449
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,455
Nobody can crack the thing...
we're talking deep encryption.

450
00:20:43,457 --> 00:20:45,256
Then you've got nothing to lose.

451
00:20:45,258 --> 00:20:46,520
Benny...

452
00:20:47,461 --> 00:20:49,440
do yourself a favor.

453
00:20:49,896 --> 00:20:52,097
Call the U.S. Attorney's Office.

454
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:54,499
They're required to provide you
with all the evidence.

455
00:20:54,501 --> 00:20:56,067
Which they will.

456
00:20:56,069 --> 00:20:58,737
Just... not in time
for us to decrypt it.

457
00:20:58,739 --> 00:21:00,972
And what makes you think
you can decrypt it?

458
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,211
Got no other way to think.

459
00:21:16,634 --> 00:21:18,884
See? Dreams do come true.

460
00:21:18,886 --> 00:21:20,652
<i>I didn't expect</i>

461
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,621
to see you until I got to court.

462
00:21:22,623 --> 00:21:24,053
And maybe not even then.

463
00:21:24,055 --> 00:21:26,091
Hey, it's voir dire day.

464
00:21:26,093 --> 00:21:27,993
I'm not gonna miss voir dire day.

465
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,928
Maybe you haven't heard, but I'm the guy

466
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:33,532
who actually put the "voir"
in voir dire day.

467
00:21:35,035 --> 00:21:36,612
Hold your applause.

468
00:21:37,603 --> 00:21:40,871
Plus, we never get a chance
to compare jury strategies.

469
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,676
This doesn't work for me.

470
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:45,711
Hmm?

471
00:21:45,713 --> 00:21:47,998
I need to know whose team you're on.

472
00:21:48,677 --> 00:21:51,183
I'm on... your team, obviously.

473
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:52,684
There is no other team.

474
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,619
But part of being on your team

475
00:21:54,621 --> 00:21:57,322
is me telling you
what I think, which I did,

476
00:21:57,324 --> 00:22:01,262
maybe a little too passionately,
for which I apologize.

477
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:09,167
Well, obviously, I think
the key is to find people

478
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:10,736
who are sympathetic to the idea

479
00:22:10,738 --> 00:22:12,504
that our right to privacy
isn't something

480
00:22:12,506 --> 00:22:14,382
that can be traded away
when it suits the government.

481
00:22:14,384 --> 00:22:15,648
Mm.

482
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,643
Yeah, that's one approach.

483
00:22:18,645 --> 00:22:21,046
But it's better when you can lay
off all that government stuff

484
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,808
and just make it personal.

485
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:25,283
What's more personal
than the Constitution?

486
00:22:25,285 --> 00:22:26,985
Than our Bill of Rights?

487
00:22:26,987 --> 00:22:29,790
Your browser history, for one.

488
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:32,824
We all have secrets, J.P.

489
00:22:32,826 --> 00:22:36,161
And because we conduct
so much of our personal

490
00:22:36,163 --> 00:22:39,097
and business lives
on phones and computers,

491
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:40,665
those secrets don't go away.

492
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:43,034
They're parked
all over the world on servers,

493
00:22:43,036 --> 00:22:45,103
just like the ones your client owns.

494
00:22:45,105 --> 00:22:47,595
So, I think the key is
to find people who

495
00:22:47,597 --> 00:22:49,627
understand that.

496
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:52,411
Who understand
this is a personal threat.

497
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:57,949
Potential juror number one:
pool equipment salesman.

498
00:22:57,951 --> 00:22:59,818
38 years old.

499
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,253
My deep dive on the Web

500
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:03,855
indicates he has nothing
in his bank account.

501
00:23:03,857 --> 00:23:06,250
His mortgage is seriously underwater.

502
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:08,693
Oh, he's wearing
an expensive wristwatch,

503
00:23:08,695 --> 00:23:11,329
and has a ring full of bling.

504
00:23:11,331 --> 00:23:14,099
Certainly wants to project
the appearance of success.

505
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:17,202
That is a man who values his secrets.

506
00:23:17,204 --> 00:23:18,468
Our kind of guy.

507
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:23,542
Potential juror number 11 is
a 32-year-old graphics designer.

508
00:23:23,544 --> 00:23:25,911
And speaking of "graphic,"
he happens to subscribe

509
00:23:25,913 --> 00:23:27,979
to three different
pornographic websites.

510
00:23:27,981 --> 00:23:31,283
Three? But so much of it is free.

511
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,617
I'm told.

512
00:23:33,988 --> 00:23:39,057
Hands up. How many of you have
watched adult entertainment?

513
00:23:40,227 --> 00:23:41,860
How many of you

514
00:23:41,862 --> 00:23:43,628
subscribe... that is, pay money...

515
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,498
to have access to an adult website?

516
00:23:49,902 --> 00:23:52,436
That's the man I want on my jury.

517
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,480
Chunk, you scared me.

518
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:02,914
What are you doing in here?

519
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:04,149
I'm looking for a jacket.

520
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,684
I've been trailing that guy Harry Kemp

521
00:24:05,686 --> 00:24:07,355
for the last two nights
in the same coat,

522
00:24:07,357 --> 00:24:08,666
and I need something new.

523
00:24:09,562 --> 00:24:10,728
Nice.

524
00:24:10,744 --> 00:24:11,943
I want this back.

525
00:24:11,945 --> 00:24:13,328
Make no promises.

526
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,246
It's weird, you know.

527
00:24:15,248 --> 00:24:16,514
Every night around midnight,

528
00:24:16,516 --> 00:24:18,916
he ends up in the same office
on Sixth Avenue.

529
00:24:18,918 --> 00:24:20,918
It's a place called
The Foresight Foundry.

530
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,854
There's nothing about them
on the Internet.

531
00:24:22,856 --> 00:24:25,590
They have cameras out front
and a handprint reader,

532
00:24:25,592 --> 00:24:28,226
so it's not like I can
just walk inside, you know?

533
00:24:28,228 --> 00:24:29,294
Sounds serious.

534
00:24:29,296 --> 00:24:31,095
You know those little transmitters

535
00:24:31,097 --> 00:24:34,232
that you stick on Bull in
court so Marissa can hear him?

536
00:24:37,537 --> 00:24:38,536
Bingo.

537
00:24:38,538 --> 00:24:40,138
I want my coat back.

538
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,839
I make no promises.

539
00:24:46,946 --> 00:24:48,646
Thanks for dinner.

540
00:24:48,648 --> 00:24:52,283
Well, I think we did
all we could jury wise.

541
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:55,553
So what turned you around?

542
00:24:55,983 --> 00:24:57,955
I mean, last night, you
were convinced we were

543
00:24:57,957 --> 00:24:59,557
harboring killers,

544
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:02,226
and today, you're helping me
find just the right jurors

545
00:25:02,228 --> 00:25:05,296
with the deepest, darkest secrets.

546
00:25:05,848 --> 00:25:08,132
Seems a little schizophrenic,
wouldn't you say?

547
00:25:08,134 --> 00:25:09,801
You hired me to do a job.

548
00:25:09,803 --> 00:25:13,538
I realized... I had an obligation...

549
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:18,445
to you, your client and myself.

550
00:25:18,447 --> 00:25:21,104
Nice summation, Counselor.

551
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:24,009
I'm not sure I completely believe it.

552
00:25:24,011 --> 00:25:26,751
But I appreciate the
effort it must have taken

553
00:25:26,753 --> 00:25:29,987
to put your boots on
and shovel all that over my way.

554
00:25:34,461 --> 00:25:37,161
See you in the morning, Bull.

555
00:25:50,777 --> 00:25:52,337
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

556
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,011
Are you okay?

557
00:25:54,013 --> 00:25:55,146
- Yeah. I just...
- I'm sorry.

558
00:25:55,148 --> 00:25:56,614
- Get your hands off me.
- Okay.

559
00:25:56,616 --> 00:25:57,815
My hands aren't on you.

560
00:25:57,817 --> 00:25:59,817
God, watch where you're going.

561
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:01,953
I'm sorry.

562
00:26:08,928 --> 00:26:11,662
Taxi? Taxi?

563
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:22,140
Isn't it past your TV time?

564
00:26:22,142 --> 00:26:23,641
Shouldn't you be asleep,

565
00:26:23,643 --> 00:26:26,477
so you can have a productive day
at school tomorrow?

566
00:26:27,947 --> 00:26:30,782
Is this even something someone
your age should be watching?

567
00:26:33,086 --> 00:26:34,643
What is this?

568
00:26:35,321 --> 00:26:36,687
What's that?

569
00:26:37,692 --> 00:26:39,490
Oh, goodness.

570
00:26:39,492 --> 00:26:40,992
- Is it...?
- Mm-hmm.

571
00:26:40,994 --> 00:26:42,927
But how?

572
00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:45,663
You don't want to know, but
you might want to thank Benny.

573
00:26:45,665 --> 00:26:48,032
And it's unencrypted?

574
00:26:48,034 --> 00:26:50,935
Looks that way.
The parts we needed anyway.

575
00:26:50,937 --> 00:26:52,437
You were able to do that?

576
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:54,605
- Nope.
- Cable?

577
00:26:55,952 --> 00:26:58,609
Not her personally,
but she made it happen.

578
00:26:58,611 --> 00:27:00,578
And who made her happen?

579
00:27:01,881 --> 00:27:03,155
Hmm.

580
00:27:04,317 --> 00:27:05,858
Thank you.

581
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:10,421
You didn't happen to apologize
to her for me, did you?

582
00:27:11,957 --> 00:27:14,158
Oh, good, 'cause I wanted
to do that myself.

583
00:27:18,231 --> 00:27:19,597
Did you find anything?

584
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:20,898
Nope, not yet.

585
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,333
Can I help?

586
00:27:22,335 --> 00:27:24,001
You have court in the morning.

587
00:27:24,003 --> 00:27:25,703
Well, so do you, kind of.

588
00:27:25,705 --> 00:27:26,838
Go to bed, Bull.

589
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,873
It'll go so much faster
without you here.

590
00:27:34,914 --> 00:27:36,414
Thank you.

591
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:38,349
Honestly.

592
00:27:39,193 --> 00:27:40,184
Thank you.

593
00:27:41,624 --> 00:27:43,154
Are you still up?

594
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:46,123
I'm going.

595
00:28:04,244 --> 00:28:06,445
Peace offering.

596
00:28:09,516 --> 00:28:12,250
Thank you for agreeing to see me

597
00:28:12,252 --> 00:28:14,107
so early in the morning.

598
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,979
I owe you an apology.

599
00:28:20,194 --> 00:28:21,760
I'm a psychologist by trade,

600
00:28:21,762 --> 00:28:25,163
which implies that I know
something about human behavior.

601
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,700
Which makes it all the more embarrassing

602
00:28:28,702 --> 00:28:30,787
when I have no control over my own.

603
00:28:34,908 --> 00:28:36,379
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

604
00:28:38,812 --> 00:28:40,946
I'm sorry I threatened your job.

605
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:46,017
And I appreciate what you did
to help me and Marissa,

606
00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:48,286
even though I know
it went against your principles.

607
00:28:48,288 --> 00:28:51,790
It wasn't me. I got help from
this hacker group I belong to.

608
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:55,026
Mostly, this guy
in Frankfurt... EIKabong.

609
00:28:55,028 --> 00:28:57,129
At least I think he's a guy.

610
00:28:57,488 --> 00:29:01,433
Well, thank...
Mr. or Mrs. Kabong for me.

611
00:29:01,435 --> 00:29:05,604
And on reflection, I'm not totally sure

612
00:29:05,606 --> 00:29:08,940
my principles make all that much sense.

613
00:29:08,942 --> 00:29:12,995
I think... I was just upset.

614
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,113
I was mad at Heptex

615
00:29:15,115 --> 00:29:17,415
'cause they wouldn't help
figure out who hurt my friend,

616
00:29:17,417 --> 00:29:21,219
and I was mad at you for helping Heptex.

617
00:29:22,744 --> 00:29:24,589
And then Marissa explained to me

618
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:27,058
that you were mad at Heptex, too.

619
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,160
You were frustrated.

620
00:29:28,162 --> 00:29:30,262
You wanted to get to the bottom of it,

621
00:29:30,264 --> 00:29:33,982
and the only way to do that was
to see what was on the server.

622
00:29:37,538 --> 00:29:39,337
She have any luck yet?

623
00:29:39,339 --> 00:29:41,315
Not the last time I checked.

624
00:29:43,843 --> 00:29:46,541
Would you like me to go to the office?

625
00:29:47,181 --> 00:29:50,015
Maybe take over
while she helps you out here?

626
00:29:51,347 --> 00:29:52,951
Yes, please.

627
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:01,459
Uh, for what it's worth,

628
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:03,528
I'm not actually sure

629
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,810
we're right about
any of that stuff anyway.

630
00:30:08,535 --> 00:30:10,003
What do you mean?

631
00:30:11,063 --> 00:30:12,237
What are you talking about?

632
00:30:12,239 --> 00:30:15,106
I just think the world must have
been an easier place to navigate

633
00:30:15,108 --> 00:30:17,909
when everything we did,
every secret we have,

634
00:30:17,911 --> 00:30:20,512
everything we ever
looked up, wondered about,

635
00:30:20,514 --> 00:30:22,747
dreamed about, wasn't preserved online

636
00:30:22,749 --> 00:30:24,891
where someone else could find it.

637
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,186
Where's this coming from?

638
00:30:29,363 --> 00:30:32,157
When Kabong cracked the server,

639
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,971
I did a search, just to test it.

640
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:37,651
I searched "Jason Bull."

641
00:30:39,566 --> 00:30:43,168
All this time,
listening to you talk about

642
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,103
how little you think of lawyers,

643
00:30:45,105 --> 00:30:47,405
how that's the last
thing you want to do,

644
00:30:47,407 --> 00:30:50,275
how they're the lowest form of life.

645
00:30:50,747 --> 00:30:52,844
Well, some of that was for effect.

646
00:30:52,995 --> 00:30:56,615
Dr. Bull, in 2003,

647
00:30:56,617 --> 00:31:00,354
a "J. Bull" took the bar exam in Texas.

648
00:31:01,188 --> 00:31:02,810
And failed.

649
00:31:03,657 --> 00:31:05,203
Twice.

650
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:15,171
Now you know.

651
00:31:16,843 --> 00:31:18,755
But I didn't need to.

652
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:23,341
I just think that people
should be entitled to fail

653
00:31:23,343 --> 00:31:25,210
without the whole world knowing.

654
00:31:25,514 --> 00:31:28,146
That we shouldn't let the
bad guys hurt the good guys,

655
00:31:28,148 --> 00:31:29,381
but we also shouldn't

656
00:31:29,383 --> 00:31:32,043
penalize the good guys
if we can avoid it.

657
00:31:33,331 --> 00:31:36,388
You might be
onto something there, Cable.

658
00:31:38,025 --> 00:31:39,524
Thank you.

659
00:31:39,526 --> 00:31:40,905
Again.

660
00:31:41,946 --> 00:31:43,028
Okay.

661
00:31:47,267 --> 00:31:49,367
<i>Terrorists are out there,</i>

662
00:31:49,369 --> 00:31:51,094
and they want to hurt us.

663
00:31:51,972 --> 00:31:54,906
It's a grim reality of modern-day life.

664
00:31:56,476 --> 00:31:57,927
We've all seen it.

665
00:31:58,431 --> 00:31:59,764
Sadly,

666
00:31:59,913 --> 00:32:02,448
some of us have even experienced it.

667
00:32:02,983 --> 00:32:05,216
Terror is real.

668
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:08,320
And our fear of it is justified.

669
00:32:08,322 --> 00:32:11,122
But our country is founded...

670
00:32:11,124 --> 00:32:13,591
You don't want to hear
how they're reacting, Bull.

671
00:32:13,593 --> 00:32:15,927
Yeah, I can see it.

672
00:32:15,929 --> 00:32:17,696
- It's bad.
- They're asleep, Bull.

673
00:32:17,698 --> 00:32:19,731
Actually, I'm kind of jealous.

674
00:32:19,733 --> 00:32:21,566
Nothing she's saying
is resonating with them.

675
00:32:21,568 --> 00:32:24,202
...it's very hard to put the
genie back in the bottle.

676
00:32:28,508 --> 00:32:30,842
Rights are... something to be protected.

677
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:35,313
And cherished, and...

678
00:32:35,315 --> 00:32:37,482
Your Honor, would you excuse me?

679
00:32:40,754 --> 00:32:42,287
Are you all right?

680
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:47,525
Your Honor, can I take
a five-minute recess?

681
00:32:47,527 --> 00:32:50,962
If you can cure that man in five
minutes, you can be<i> my</i> doctor.

682
00:32:50,964 --> 00:32:52,330
Five-minute recess.

683
00:32:55,335 --> 00:32:57,403
Listen to me.

684
00:32:58,538 --> 00:32:59,830
I was wrong.

685
00:32:59,832 --> 00:33:01,897
You interrupted my summation to the jury

686
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:03,372
to tell me you were
wrong about something?

687
00:33:03,374 --> 00:33:04,809
I interrupted your summation to the jury

688
00:33:04,811 --> 00:33:06,811
because it isn't working,
and the reason it isn't working

689
00:33:06,813 --> 00:33:08,380
is because I don't think
you believe it anymore.

690
00:33:08,382 --> 00:33:10,181
I think I convinced you

691
00:33:10,183 --> 00:33:12,164
that your thinking was faulty.

692
00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:14,552
But it wasn't.

693
00:33:14,554 --> 00:33:16,005
<i>My</i> thinking...

694
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:17,956
my thinking was faulty.

695
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:19,224
What are you talking about?

696
00:33:19,226 --> 00:33:20,759
I think the world must have been

697
00:33:20,761 --> 00:33:23,661
an easier place to navigate
when everything we did,

698
00:33:23,663 --> 00:33:25,063
every secret we had,

699
00:33:25,065 --> 00:33:26,798
everything we looked up, wondered about,

700
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,299
dreamt about, try to accomplish,

701
00:33:28,301 --> 00:33:30,735
fail to accomplish,
give up on or succeed,

702
00:33:30,737 --> 00:33:32,804
wasn't stored forever in one place

703
00:33:32,806 --> 00:33:34,672
where someone, maybe even

704
00:33:34,674 --> 00:33:38,710
our government, can see it and judge it,

705
00:33:38,712 --> 00:33:43,314
and then use it against us
without our permission.

706
00:33:45,986 --> 00:33:48,354
'Cause you know what happens
in a country like that?

707
00:33:48,356 --> 00:33:50,756
People stop looking things up.

708
00:33:51,758 --> 00:33:54,477
People stop wondering.

709
00:33:55,228 --> 00:33:57,762
People stop dreaming.

710
00:33:58,277 --> 00:34:00,065
They don't fail.

711
00:34:00,067 --> 00:34:02,636
They just don't do anything.

712
00:34:02,803 --> 00:34:05,403
Because when their right to privacy

713
00:34:05,405 --> 00:34:07,138
is taken away,

714
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:12,310
their ability to move forward,
to reinvent themselves,

715
00:34:12,312 --> 00:34:16,848
to imagine something better
is taken away, too.

716
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:19,117
So, please,

717
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,654
vote "not guilty" on
the government's motion

718
00:34:22,656 --> 00:34:25,388
to unlock my client's servers.

719
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,764
We'll still find the bad guys.

720
00:34:29,685 --> 00:34:32,530
We've managed to do it
for a couple of hundred years

721
00:34:32,532 --> 00:34:35,533
without invading the privacy of others.

722
00:34:37,037 --> 00:34:39,370
And we've done it with liberty

723
00:34:39,741 --> 00:34:42,907
and justice for all.

724
00:34:44,711 --> 00:34:46,077
Thank you.

725
00:34:46,387 --> 00:34:47,345
Wow.

726
00:34:47,347 --> 00:34:49,848
What do you mean, "wow"?
What do the graphs say?

727
00:34:50,145 --> 00:34:52,450
Oh, G... I'm sorry, Bull.
I got so caught up

728
00:34:52,452 --> 00:34:54,686
in what she was saying,
I-I forgot to look.

729
00:35:00,327 --> 00:35:01,693
Mr. Foreman,

730
00:35:01,695 --> 00:35:03,461
- have you reached a verdict?
- Yes, Your Honor.

731
00:35:03,463 --> 00:35:06,831
In the case of
<i>The United States v. Heptex,</i>

732
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:09,300
<i>Garrett Tilden and Harold Kemp,</i>

733
00:35:09,302 --> 00:35:12,003
on charges of violating Title 18...

734
00:35:12,005 --> 00:35:15,106
concealment of records
in a federal investigation...

735
00:35:15,108 --> 00:35:17,976
we find the defendants not guilty.

736
00:35:17,978 --> 00:35:20,147
Jury, thank you for your service.

737
00:35:20,149 --> 00:35:22,347
Court is adjourned.

738
00:35:37,464 --> 00:35:38,963
Congratulations, Chief.

739
00:35:38,965 --> 00:35:41,266
Thank you, Marissa. I couldn't
have done it without you.

740
00:35:41,268 --> 00:35:42,644
But I got a question for you:

741
00:35:43,103 --> 00:35:45,193
how's Cable doing with that server?

742
00:35:45,572 --> 00:35:46,804
She find anything yet?

743
00:35:46,806 --> 00:35:48,039
Not really.

744
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:49,487
No major breakthroughs yet.

745
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:52,410
Well, tell her to stop.
Tell her to forget it.

746
00:35:52,412 --> 00:35:53,545
Whatever you say.

747
00:35:53,547 --> 00:35:55,502
And Danny... she discover anything?

748
00:35:55,504 --> 00:35:57,549
Nothing she can make sense of yet.

749
00:35:57,551 --> 00:35:59,083
Tell her to stop as well.

750
00:35:59,085 --> 00:36:00,521
Case is closed.

751
00:36:01,188 --> 00:36:03,922
And you should go home
and get some sleep.

752
00:36:04,311 --> 00:36:06,175
Aye, aye, Captain.

753
00:36:06,726 --> 00:36:08,118
Night.

754
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:12,230
No, no, no, no, you can't eat on
a momentous occasion like this

755
00:36:12,232 --> 00:36:14,232
and not wash it down with

756
00:36:14,234 --> 00:36:17,268
Champagne Armand de Brignac Brut.

757
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,670
I happen to have

758
00:36:18,672 --> 00:36:21,506
a bottle on these very premises.

759
00:36:27,914 --> 00:36:29,013
Oh.

760
00:36:29,015 --> 00:36:30,648
Huh.

761
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:31,716
Oh, hi.

762
00:36:31,718 --> 00:36:34,118
Bull. Hi, J.P.

763
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,254
I don't get this.
What is everybody doing here?

764
00:36:36,256 --> 00:36:37,789
And why aren't you asleep, young lady?

765
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:39,390
I know you told us to forget about it,

766
00:36:39,392 --> 00:36:41,226
but right after I got off
the phone with you,

767
00:36:41,228 --> 00:36:42,827
we made some real headway.

768
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:44,996
Want to see what we've got?

769
00:36:46,933 --> 00:36:49,133
Is she talking about the server?

770
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:53,104
That's the server you have
in there, isn't it?

771
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,944
You know, I'm... I'm so sorry.

772
00:36:59,946 --> 00:37:02,046
Forget I said anything.

773
00:37:02,048 --> 00:37:03,948
Bull, I'm gonna... okay.

774
00:37:09,322 --> 00:37:10,521
You go ahead.

775
00:37:10,889 --> 00:37:12,257
Go in there.

776
00:37:13,393 --> 00:37:15,460
Do it. You know you want to.

777
00:37:17,631 --> 00:37:19,097
What about dinner?

778
00:37:19,546 --> 00:37:22,734
I'm gonna let you in
on a big secret, Mr. Bull.

779
00:37:24,604 --> 00:37:26,237
They serve dinner
every night of the week

780
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:27,338
here in New York City.

781
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,706
Oh.

782
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:29,974
Mm.

783
00:37:32,746 --> 00:37:34,381
Thanks for your help today.

784
00:37:34,383 --> 00:37:35,912
Hmm.

785
00:37:36,816 --> 00:37:40,351
Of course if you do find
anything interesting,

786
00:37:40,353 --> 00:37:42,412
I have been known to eat late.

787
00:37:46,903 --> 00:37:48,960
Thank you for agreeing
to meet us on such short notice.

788
00:37:48,962 --> 00:37:50,495
For you two, anything.

789
00:37:50,497 --> 00:37:55,166
Well, we've been trying to
puzzle a couple of things out.

790
00:37:55,168 --> 00:37:56,534
Couple of computer things,

791
00:37:56,536 --> 00:37:57,969
mathematical curiosities.

792
00:37:57,971 --> 00:38:00,038
And I remember you saying
that Mr. Kemp here

793
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,006
was one of the smartest guys
you ever met.

794
00:38:02,008 --> 00:38:04,108
Anyway, an associate of mine

795
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,677
has been working on this case.

796
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:07,245
She's been following a suspect.

797
00:38:07,247 --> 00:38:09,447
And every night, around midnight,

798
00:38:09,449 --> 00:38:10,815
this suspect disappears

799
00:38:10,817 --> 00:38:13,818
into a high-security office
on Sixth Avenue

800
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,254
called The Foresight Foundry.

801
00:38:16,256 --> 00:38:17,855
Long story short,

802
00:38:17,857 --> 00:38:21,526
she got this recording
of her suspect and someone

803
00:38:21,528 --> 00:38:23,394
on the inside.

804
00:38:23,396 --> 00:38:24,696
Now, we were wondering

805
00:38:24,698 --> 00:38:25,898
if you could make heads or tail of it,

806
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,679
because the quality isn't great,
the voices are pretty rough,

807
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:31,002
but you-you can make out
what they're saying.

808
00:38:32,205 --> 00:38:35,406
Ready? BA111.

809
00:38:35,408 --> 00:38:37,675
Um, 6:59 a.m.

810
00:38:37,677 --> 00:38:39,187
AA3.

811
00:38:39,189 --> 00:38:41,131
I'm gonna go with 3:22 p.m.

812
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:43,668
DL1520.

813
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,450
7:14 p.m.

814
00:38:45,452 --> 00:38:46,517
Yeah.

815
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:47,885
That's three.

816
00:38:47,887 --> 00:38:48,820
That's good.

817
00:38:48,822 --> 00:38:49,821
A million per?

818
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,422
A million per.

819
00:38:51,424 --> 00:38:52,457
Huh?

820
00:38:53,154 --> 00:38:54,392
I have no idea.

821
00:38:55,295 --> 00:38:56,361
Me either.

822
00:38:56,363 --> 00:38:57,729
I know.

823
00:38:57,731 --> 00:38:59,964
It's really a puzzler, isn't it?

824
00:38:59,966 --> 00:39:03,401
Turns out, it is a form
of extreme gambling.

825
00:39:03,403 --> 00:39:06,571
Folks with major money who want to get

826
00:39:06,573 --> 00:39:10,041
a serious rush, they bet on
extraordinarily mundane things

827
00:39:10,043 --> 00:39:11,943
that they have no control over.

828
00:39:11,945 --> 00:39:13,144
Like the times

829
00:39:13,146 --> 00:39:16,681
major airlines actually
touch down at airports

830
00:39:16,683 --> 00:39:18,216
all over the world.

831
00:39:18,218 --> 00:39:19,317
That's what that was.

832
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:20,418
"A million per."

833
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,586
The man you just listened to

834
00:39:21,588 --> 00:39:24,389
bet $3 million in one night.

835
00:39:24,391 --> 00:39:25,649
And lost, by the way.

836
00:39:25,651 --> 00:39:28,693
Okay. So what does
any of this have to do with us?

837
00:39:28,695 --> 00:39:29,927
Well, I'm getting to that.

838
00:39:29,929 --> 00:39:32,764
So, these are the wire transfer receipts

839
00:39:32,766 --> 00:39:34,699
from a Swiss bank.

840
00:39:34,701 --> 00:39:38,870
Now, someone in your company
who was $65 million underwater

841
00:39:38,872 --> 00:39:41,973
received a wire transfer
immediately following

842
00:39:41,975 --> 00:39:46,010
the Midtown bombing for $100 million.

843
00:39:48,768 --> 00:39:50,635
Putting him $35 million up.

844
00:39:52,819 --> 00:39:57,280
Uh... J.P., I don't understand.

845
00:39:57,282 --> 00:39:59,257
The man who lost that money gambling

846
00:39:59,259 --> 00:40:01,959
and the man who got
$100 million wired to him

847
00:40:01,961 --> 00:40:04,729
within minutes of the blast
are the same man.

848
00:40:05,365 --> 00:40:07,031
And we can prove it.

849
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,537
Do you have any idea
what they're talking about?

850
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,405
They hacked into our server.

851
00:40:14,407 --> 00:40:15,873
They got a copy or...

852
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:16,974
Wait, wait, wait.

853
00:40:16,976 --> 00:40:19,076
So what they're saying is true?

854
00:40:24,017 --> 00:40:25,249
Is it you?

855
00:40:25,251 --> 00:40:26,897
W-What did you do, Harry?!

856
00:40:26,899 --> 00:40:28,252
He sold the names

857
00:40:28,254 --> 00:40:30,221
of three very wealthy
and powerful people

858
00:40:30,223 --> 00:40:33,024
to an international consortium
that wanted them dead.

859
00:40:33,026 --> 00:40:34,192
He was able to guarantee

860
00:40:34,194 --> 00:40:36,294
that they would all be
in the hotel ballroom

861
00:40:36,296 --> 00:40:38,296
at 10:15 in the morning.

862
00:40:38,298 --> 00:40:40,264
All sitting at the same table.

863
00:40:40,266 --> 00:40:42,099
The table the bomb was attached to.

864
00:40:42,101 --> 00:40:44,807
And it had nothing to do with eco-terror

865
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:47,538
and everything to do with
how some people are willing

866
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:50,675
to kill to get people out of the way.

867
00:40:52,365 --> 00:40:54,532
Is any of this true, Harry?

868
00:40:56,983 --> 00:40:58,255
Doesn't matter.

869
00:40:59,152 --> 00:41:01,015
They can't go to anyone with it.

870
00:41:01,754 --> 00:41:03,334
Attorney-client privilege.

871
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:05,022
Hmm.

872
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,891
Okay.

873
00:41:06,893 --> 00:41:09,974
Now you actually force me
to embarrass myself.

874
00:41:10,663 --> 00:41:12,230
I'm actually not an attorney.

875
00:41:12,232 --> 00:41:13,798
Which, by the way,

876
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,063
is also on your server,

877
00:41:15,065 --> 00:41:16,812
which is why I was able

878
00:41:16,814 --> 00:41:18,002
to call the FBI.

879
00:41:18,004 --> 00:41:19,737
Oh, look, here they are.

880
00:41:22,108 --> 00:41:24,876
Harry Kemp, stand up.

881
00:41:24,878 --> 00:41:26,744
You have the right to remain silent.

882
00:41:26,746 --> 00:41:28,179
Anything you say can and will

883
00:41:28,181 --> 00:41:30,248
be used against you in a court of law.

884
00:41:31,076 --> 00:41:32,583
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

885
00:41:32,585 --> 00:41:34,986
Just let me feed the dog,
and then I promise,

886
00:41:34,988 --> 00:41:37,188
we will go out for a victory dinner.

887
00:41:38,925 --> 00:41:40,425
You have a dog?

888
00:41:40,527 --> 00:41:42,107
I sure do.

889
00:41:42,929 --> 00:41:45,630
It's not one of those little
ball of lint things

890
00:41:45,632 --> 00:41:47,231
that people carry around in their purse,

891
00:41:47,233 --> 00:41:48,966
but like a real dog?

892
00:41:51,871 --> 00:41:53,234
Oh.

893
00:41:53,873 --> 00:41:55,273
Hi.

894
00:41:55,275 --> 00:41:57,642
Wow, a collie.

895
00:41:59,312 --> 00:42:01,445
Is that real enough for you?

896
00:42:01,447 --> 00:42:03,381
Yeah.

897
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,117
It's kind of perfect.

898
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:09,020
Wow, lot of books lying around...

899
00:42:10,857 --> 00:42:12,258
...fireplace...

900
00:42:13,026 --> 00:42:14,962
and a lot of wood.

901
00:42:15,862 --> 00:42:18,229
I love the open ceilings.

902
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:22,934
And what am I looking at out here?

903
00:42:22,936 --> 00:42:25,269
That's the Pond in Central Park.

904
00:42:27,106 --> 00:42:29,173
She's got a pond.

905
00:42:29,175 --> 00:42:30,474
Hi, honey.

906
00:42:30,476 --> 00:42:32,777
Hi, mister. Hi.

907
00:42:32,779 --> 00:42:36,614
You have no idea
how much trouble you're in.

908
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,150
You ready?

909
00:42:40,286 --> 00:42:41,819
Ah.

910
00:42:42,305 --> 00:43:42,319

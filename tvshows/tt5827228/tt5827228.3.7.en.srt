1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,273
Tally. For God's sake.

2
00:00:12,316 --> 00:00:14,623
That was a hundred dollar
bottle of liquor.

3
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:19,062
Just say you won't do it.

4
00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:20,648
I'm not gonna have that
conversation with you here, sis.

5
00:00:20,672 --> 00:00:22,065
It's supposed to be a party.

6
00:00:23,893 --> 00:00:26,852
When are we gonna have it?
Were we ever gonna have it?

7
00:00:26,896 --> 00:00:29,420
Or were you just gonna do
what you were going to do?

8
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:30,856
You're acting crazy.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,033
Crazy. Is that why
you're doing this?

10
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:35,513
Because I'm so crazy?

11
00:00:35,557 --> 00:00:37,385
You haven't seen crazy.

12
00:00:37,428 --> 00:00:38,951
Tally... Don't you dare.

13
00:00:38,995 --> 00:00:40,910
Hey, everyone just chill.

14
00:00:40,953 --> 00:00:43,217
Okay? It's a party.

16
00:01:49,196 --> 00:01:51,154
911. What's your emergency?

17
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:53,287
My God, you have to help me.

18
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,508
I think somebody's murdered
my brother.

19
00:01:57,552 --> 00:01:59,989
My God. Please, please.

20
00:02:00,032 --> 00:02:02,426
There's so much blood.
I don't know what to do.

21
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,689
I need you to stay calm, ma'am.
Help is on the way.

22
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:07,127
Thank you. Thank you.

23
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,009
Tally North,

24
00:02:20,052 --> 00:02:21,750
ethereal downtown party fixture,

25
00:02:21,793 --> 00:02:24,448
trust fund poster child, is
accused of killing her brother.

26
00:02:24,492 --> 00:02:26,276
Torin North,
a rising tech superstar,

27
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,712
in the Chelsea loft they share,

28
00:02:27,756 --> 00:02:30,106
and into which they poured
several million dollars

29
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,543
following the death
of their wealthy parents

30
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:33,762
in a private plane crash.

31
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:39,202
Tally.

32
00:02:58,003 --> 00:03:00,963
You have new glasses, Dr. Bull.

33
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:03,095
It's nice to see you too, Tally.

34
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:05,228
It's been 12 years.

35
00:03:05,272 --> 00:03:07,665
I like them.

36
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:09,711
Thank you.

37
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:13,280
I heard about your parents.

38
00:03:13,323 --> 00:03:16,848
I tried calling,
but my numbers didn't work.

39
00:03:16,892 --> 00:03:18,807
I sent you a card.

40
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,375
Okay. I didn't see it,

41
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:25,248
but I think I might have
been in a hospital

42
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:28,599
in Indiana around then.

43
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:32,168
Are you here because you want me
back as a patient?

44
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,605
I came here to see
if I could help you.

45
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:37,434
Legally, psychologically.

46
00:03:37,478 --> 00:03:40,220
So you can leave me again?

47
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:44,049
I know you don't feel much,

48
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:48,837
but I have always felt badly
about that.

49
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,275
It's okay. I survived.

50
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,277
I won't lie,
it would have been nice

51
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:58,063
to have you around for all
my teenage rites of passage.

52
00:03:58,107 --> 00:04:00,501
But I guess that's what
the eight other therapists

53
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:03,155
I ended up going to were for.

54
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,723
Although it was difficult
to talk to the one that was

55
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:10,946
molesting me about how much
I disliked him molesting me.

56
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:13,601
I know you're angry with me...

57
00:04:13,644 --> 00:04:16,125
Dr. Bull,
you know better than anyone,

58
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:18,258
I'm largely incapable of anger.

59
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:23,437
Well, whatever you call it,
however you process it,

60
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,049
I'm sorry if you felt abandoned.

61
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,227
You know, when I closed
my practice back then,

62
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,098
it was to start
a whole new business,

63
00:04:33,142 --> 00:04:35,666
something called trial science.

64
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,103
I work with lawyers,
and we help to figure out

65
00:04:38,147 --> 00:04:41,106
the best way to try a case.

66
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,326
I know I haven't seen
you since you were 14,

67
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,980
but I don't think
you're gonna find

68
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:49,158
anyone out there
who understands you better.

69
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:53,423
And it would mean
a lot to me to help you.

70
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:55,643
You understand they want
to put you in prison

71
00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:57,645
for the rest of your life?

72
00:04:57,688 --> 00:05:02,998
Yes. I do understand that.

73
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,479
Did you do it, Tally?

74
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:08,133
Well, I wasmad at him.

75
00:05:08,177 --> 00:05:10,484
He was filing for guardianship.

76
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,009
He wanted to lock me up,
get me institutionalized.

77
00:05:14,052 --> 00:05:17,491
Did you do it, Tally?

78
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:20,058
Well, I'll tell you, Dr. Bull,

79
00:05:20,102 --> 00:05:23,366
because I know
you'll understand.

80
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,237
I have no idea.

81
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:27,892
I honestly don't remember.

82
00:05:27,936 --> 00:05:29,764
You had one of your blackouts?

83
00:05:29,807 --> 00:05:31,766
Must be.

84
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:34,421
One minute, I was having it out
with my brother at the party,

85
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:37,075
and the next, I was waking up
covered in blood,

86
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:39,687
with Torin dead on the floor.

87
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,342
I honestly don't remember
what came in between.

88
00:05:45,823 --> 00:05:48,217
You still want to help me?

89
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,629
Hey.

90
00:06:08,672 --> 00:06:10,631
You going somewhere?

91
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:12,415
Home.

92
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:14,461
What, you don't like it here?

93
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:16,419
Well, you know,

94
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:19,204
when I wake up in the morning,
I like to be near my things,

95
00:06:19,248 --> 00:06:21,903
I like clean clothes,
I like to sleep in my own bed.

96
00:06:21,946 --> 00:06:24,035
And plus,

97
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,950
you know,
Cable used to live here,

98
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:27,212
in this building.

99
00:06:27,256 --> 00:06:30,041
It just doesn't feel right.

100
00:06:30,085 --> 00:06:32,087
Okay. I hear that.

101
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:35,482
It's just, sometimes it's nice

102
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:37,962
to wake up lying next
to somebody, you know?

103
00:06:38,006 --> 00:06:39,399
Don't you think?

104
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:41,531
I'm sure it's nice for you. Me?

105
00:06:41,575 --> 00:06:44,360
I got to get to work
in the morning.

106
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,406
Okay.

107
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:49,409
I don't understand.

108
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:51,411
What's the problem?
You got what you wanted.

109
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:52,368
Wow.

110
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:56,067
Okay. You are hard, girl.

111
00:06:56,111 --> 00:06:57,262
You know, that's another thing.

112
00:06:57,286 --> 00:06:59,331
I'm not a girl. I'm a woman.

113
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,787
So stop talking to me
like it's freshman year

114
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:02,310
and we're living in the dorms
away from our folks

115
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:04,380
for the first time, yeah?

116
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,905
I had a good time.
Let's not ruin it.

117
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:09,907
Can I give you something?

118
00:07:11,343 --> 00:07:13,258
It's not your class ring?

119
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:16,392
You're not gonna ask me to go
steady, are you? What is this?

120
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,785
That's a key.

121
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,919
That way, you can get in here
whenever you want.

122
00:07:21,963 --> 00:07:25,706
Gabriel,
I'm never gonna use this.

123
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:27,925
No, no, no, it's not...
It's for emergencies.

124
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:30,058
Okay? That way, you know,
I lose my key,

125
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:31,407
I know you have one,
or if the...

126
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,757
maybe the gas company

127
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:37,152
needs to get in here, they can't
find me and they can call you.

128
00:07:37,195 --> 00:07:38,501
Hey, listen.

129
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:40,677
I mean, we're friends, right?

130
00:07:40,721 --> 00:07:43,288
That's the sort of things
friends do.

131
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:48,380
Now you give me yours?

132
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:51,296
You are so pushing your luck.

133
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,168
No, no, no...
What are you talking about?

134
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:54,386
I didn't say anything.

135
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,040
Hey, you're hearing things,
girl.

136
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:57,607
Okay, you know what?
The truth is,

137
00:07:57,651 --> 00:08:00,262
I-I can't sleep with somebody
that's in my bed anyway.

138
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:03,352
I don't care how beautiful
and-and naked they are.

139
00:08:03,395 --> 00:08:04,919
So go, please.

140
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:06,486
Okay? So I can get some rest.

141
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,488
Close the door.

142
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:10,533
Her name is Tally North.

143
00:08:10,577 --> 00:08:12,206
Since the age of ten,
she has been diagnosed

144
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,494
with antisocial
personality disorder.

145
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:16,539
She lacks empathy for others,

146
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,542
exhibits severely
stunted emotions,

147
00:08:19,586 --> 00:08:20,935
and is prone to violence.

148
00:08:20,978 --> 00:08:22,937
Isn't that what
we used to call a sociopath

149
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,939
in the good old days?

150
00:08:24,982 --> 00:08:27,376
Actually, she used
to be his patient,

151
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,813
so this is kind of personal.

152
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:31,574
This is gonna be tough,
trying to get a jury

153
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:33,556
to sympathize with a sociopath.

154
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,560
Juries usually like to see
remorse in their killers,

155
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:39,736
and there's not gonna be any.

156
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,521
The night of the murder,

157
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:44,524
Tally was arguing
with her brother, Torin.

158
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:46,526
The whole party,
a hundred-some people,

159
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:47,962
saw them going at each other.

160
00:08:48,005 --> 00:08:49,267
Well, I don't understand.

161
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:51,879
How can she be angry
if she can't feel emotions?

162
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:55,447
It's complicated, but what
sociopaths like Tally do feel

163
00:08:55,491 --> 00:08:57,580
are emotions
involving themselves.

164
00:08:57,624 --> 00:08:59,582
That's why you don't get
joy or sadness,

165
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:00,801
because those are emotions

166
00:09:00,844 --> 00:09:02,518
that come from connections
to other people.

167
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,327
But conviction? Determination?

168
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,634
Those are self-contained
and self-generating.

169
00:09:07,677 --> 00:09:09,070
All right, so,

170
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:11,333
let's cut to the chase.
Does she have an alibi?

171
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:13,335
If she does,
she doesn't remember.

172
00:09:13,378 --> 00:09:15,467
Well, that's pretty
damn convenient.

173
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:19,297
Agreed. The thing is,
she is prone to blackouts,

174
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:21,648
and swears she can't remember
anything that happened

175
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:23,911
between the confrontation
at the party and waking up

176
00:09:23,954 --> 00:09:26,348
to find her brother's dead body
on the floor.

177
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:28,611
The old "I just don't remember"
defense.

178
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:31,005
According to Bull,
she has suffered

179
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:34,225
from fugue state blackouts
since she was a child.

180
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:35,575
Fugue state blackouts?

181
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:36,663
Was she asleep?

182
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:37,881
Was she awake?

183
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:40,144
A fugue state
is a dissociative episode

184
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:43,539
where sufferers experience
temporary amnesia

185
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,455
and a lack of awareness
of themselves or their actions.

186
00:09:46,498 --> 00:09:47,978
Okay, so what's the big guy say?

187
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:50,633
Does he think that this fugue
thing is a credible defense?

188
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:53,331
Does he think that the jury
will buy into it?

189
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,987
No. Bull wants to plead not
guilty by reason of insanity.

190
00:09:58,162 --> 00:09:59,599
If Tally was in a fugue state

191
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:02,819
during the murder, she lacked
the substantial capacity

192
00:10:02,863 --> 00:10:05,343
to appreciate the criminality
of her conduct

193
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:06,518
when she killed her brother.

194
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:07,911
Terrific.

195
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:09,454
I'm gonna go back
to the conference room,

196
00:10:09,478 --> 00:10:10,827
comb through my law books,

197
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:13,525
see if I can find
any insanity plea precedents.

198
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:17,529
With any luck,
I'll fall into a fugue state.

199
00:10:21,403 --> 00:10:23,623
Dr. Bull?

200
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,625
D.A.'s office just
sent over this subpoena

201
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:28,715
for all your old records and any
recordings of therapy sessions

202
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:30,934
related to your treatment
of Tally North.

203
00:10:30,978 --> 00:10:33,850
I don't understand. Isn't
that material privileged?

204
00:10:33,894 --> 00:10:37,201
You were her doctor,
she was your patient.

205
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:39,813
Well, normally you'd be right,

206
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:43,643
but since we are raising
the insanity defense,

207
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:46,080
they are able to look at
and introduce into evidence

208
00:10:46,123 --> 00:10:48,299
anything that has to do
with Tally's mental health.

209
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:51,433
I haven't looked
at that stuff in years.

210
00:10:51,476 --> 00:10:53,541
Let me go through it tonight
and then we'll get over there

211
00:10:53,565 --> 00:10:54,645
first thing in the morning.

212
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:57,700
I can't believe

213
00:10:57,744 --> 00:10:59,310
she's dead.

214
00:10:59,354 --> 00:11:00,921
I miss her so much.

215
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:03,401
I never even
got to say good-bye.

216
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:04,838
Tally, stop it.

217
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:06,666
You're wasting my time.

218
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:08,798
You're manufacturing
your response,

219
00:11:08,842 --> 00:11:10,539
not feeling an emotion.

220
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:12,628
What are you talking about?

221
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,935
I'm not!

222
00:11:14,978 --> 00:11:17,111
She was my favorite aunt.

223
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:19,548
And I don't know how
I'm gonna go on living.

224
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:22,246
I have every confidence
you'll find a way.

225
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:26,642
You always know, don't you?

226
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,817
That's my job, Tally.

227
00:11:37,218 --> 00:11:38,538
According to
the incident reports,

228
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:41,483
the murder weapon...
The scissors...

229
00:11:41,526 --> 00:11:43,703
Were wiped clean
of fingerprints.

230
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:46,749
Dr. Diposo, you're
a forensic psychiatrist.

231
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:48,751
Have you seen this kind
of thing before?

232
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:50,884
All the time. Really?

233
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:52,668
And why would a killer
do such a thing?

234
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,497
It sort of goes without saying.

235
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,369
Generally, if a murder weapon
is found wiped of fingerprints,

236
00:11:58,413 --> 00:12:01,111
it indicates that the killer was
trying to hide their identity

237
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:02,722
to avoid getting caught.

238
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:04,158
That makes enormous sense.

239
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:06,595
Now, what makes less sense...

240
00:12:06,638 --> 00:12:08,205
And admittedly,
I'm not the expert here,

241
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:09,729
you are...

242
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:12,732
Is it possible that someone
in a fugue state blackout

243
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:14,124
would have the presence of mind

244
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:15,691
to wipe their weapon?

245
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,912
Well, that's an act
of specific intent.

246
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:20,957
I would find it highly unlikely.

247
00:12:22,654 --> 00:12:25,745
And how would you interpret
the fibers found

248
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:27,572
in the blood
on the victim's neck

249
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:29,705
and the bloodied sheet
found nearby?

250
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,056
It would appear that the killer
tried to staunch the bleeding

251
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,320
after stabbing the victim.
My guess is the killer

252
00:12:36,364 --> 00:12:38,670
experienced a moment
of remorse...

253
00:12:38,714 --> 00:12:40,585
Regretted what
he or she had done,

254
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:42,631
and wanted to try
and save the victim.

255
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:46,113
Now, in your
professional opinion,

256
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:48,768
is that kind of remorse
consistent with someone

257
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:50,030
in a fugue state, Doctor?

258
00:12:50,073 --> 00:12:51,771
Quite the contrary.

259
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:54,817
That would demonstrate
a high degree of self-awareness

260
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:57,733
that people in fugue states
rarely possess.

261
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,214
Sorry to be the bearer, but
this jury is finding the witness

262
00:13:00,257 --> 00:13:02,738
extremely credible
and compelling. At the moment,

263
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,785
we are looking at only
a single green juror.

264
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:07,699
No, no, it's fine.

265
00:13:07,743 --> 00:13:09,266
I don't care. It's all good.

266
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,702
No further questions
at this time.

267
00:13:10,746 --> 00:13:11,703
One green juror...

268
00:13:11,747 --> 00:13:13,401
You call that all good?

269
00:13:13,444 --> 00:13:15,055
I'll get 'em back
on the cross, Bull.

270
00:13:15,098 --> 00:13:16,404
Just call for a recess.

271
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:18,798
You sure?

272
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:22,671
Your Honor, the defense
would like to request

273
00:13:22,714 --> 00:13:24,281
a short recess.

274
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:28,155
Hey, you want to tell me
what's going on?

275
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:30,200
That forensic psychiatrist...

276
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:32,942
She just declared
our client not guilty.

277
00:13:32,986 --> 00:13:34,702
I'm sorry, were you in
the same courtroom I was?

278
00:13:34,726 --> 00:13:36,163
I sure was.

279
00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:39,819
She said whoever killed Torin
felt a moment of remorse.

280
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:41,864
And? Remorse is a function
of empathy.

281
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:45,302
You share the pain
the other person is feeling.

282
00:13:45,346 --> 00:13:48,523
Sociopaths like Tally
don't have empathy.

283
00:13:48,566 --> 00:13:50,830
They certainly don't
feel remorse.

284
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:53,876
Our client didn't do this.

285
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,182
She's not the killer.

286
00:13:55,225 --> 00:13:57,793
Wait a second, wait
a second, wait a second.

287
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:03,886
We already told the jury
that Tally did do it.

288
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,279
She killed her brother.

289
00:14:05,322 --> 00:14:07,542
Not guilty by
reason of insanity.

290
00:14:07,585 --> 00:14:08,891
That was our plea.

291
00:14:08,935 --> 00:14:10,806
Now we're saying
she didn't do it?

292
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:14,723
My goodness.

293
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:16,507
So, how-how does this work?

294
00:14:16,551 --> 00:14:18,596
Do we just go in there
and tell the jury

295
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,337
that we were wrong?

296
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:22,774
I guess so.

297
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:30,933
So now you want to
change your plea? I do, Your Honor.

298
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:33,046
Well, in truth, there's nothing
I can do to stop you,

299
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:36,353
but given your original plea
and your opening statement,

300
00:14:36,397 --> 00:14:38,965
I fear you're gonna
confuse and frustrate the jury.

301
00:14:41,532 --> 00:14:43,491
We are willing to accept
that risk, Your Honor.

302
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:47,451
A.D.A. Scrivener,
you have anything to say?

303
00:14:47,495 --> 00:14:49,801
I just want to be clear.
You opened the door

304
00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:51,803
to your client's mental health
when you entered

305
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:53,936
a plea of not guilty
by reason of insanity.

306
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,156
I am taking the position
that all of that material

307
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:58,245
we were able to access
by dint of that plea

308
00:14:58,288 --> 00:14:59,724
is still on the table.

309
00:14:59,768 --> 00:15:02,423
Clinical evaluations, doctors'
records, what have you...

310
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:03,946
All of that is still admissible.

311
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,992
Doesn't just go away
because you changed your mind.

312
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:08,342
We understand that.
But, just so we're clear,

313
00:15:08,385 --> 00:15:10,233
our client's mental health
is no longer the point.

314
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:12,955
We intend to prove
she simply didn't do it.

315
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:14,914
And, sane or crazy,
you can't convict someone

316
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:17,177
for something
they simply didn't do.

317
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,875
All right, everybody
back to your corners.

318
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,399
And just so that I'm clear...
New plea, old plea...

319
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:25,620
This trial is proceeding
tomorrow morning at 900 sharp.

320
00:15:25,663 --> 00:15:28,666
And please be ready to call
your first witness, gentlemen.

321
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:31,539
Years ago, when
I used to treat Tally,

322
00:15:31,582 --> 00:15:32,714
if she had one of these

323
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:36,413
fugue state blackouts...

324
00:15:36,457 --> 00:15:40,200
there were still
always splinters of memory.

325
00:15:40,243 --> 00:15:41,853
Tiny things that
she would remember

326
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:43,246
about the events
that took place.

327
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,032
And she couldn't always
make sense of them,

328
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:47,903
but they were there.

329
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,733
This murder,
this supposed blackout...

330
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:53,561
She remembers nothing.

331
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:56,477
Which makes perfect sense
if she didn't do it.

332
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,350
Yeah, but having her testify
that she simply doesn't remember

333
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:03,049
is not going to convince
the jury to let her off.

334
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,443
I know this is easier
said than done,

335
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:08,532
but I fear the only way
to prove she didn't do it

336
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:10,099
is to figure out who did.

337
00:16:10,143 --> 00:16:11,361
See that?

338
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:14,016
Mediocre minds think alike.

339
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,106
Danny and I are
way ahead of you on this.

340
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:22,938
What have we here?

341
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,655
This is everyone
we've been able to confirm

342
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,594
was in attendance at that party.

343
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:28,988
I sourced most of them from
the party's Facebook page.

344
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:30,902
These gray boxes
with question marks

345
00:16:30,946 --> 00:16:32,382
are still unidentified guests.

346
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:35,559
Apparently, there were
a lot of uninvited walk-ins.

347
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:37,344
Anybody jump out at you?

348
00:16:37,387 --> 00:16:38,780
Yeah, this guy.

349
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:40,540
With the red baseball cap
with the plaid shirt.

350
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:43,524
Almost everyone
that I spoke with mentioned him.

351
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:45,134
And he brought hostess gifts.

352
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:47,006
Drugs. A lot of them.

353
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,489
Torin confronted him,
kicked him out.

354
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:49,969
Might be something,
might be nothing.

355
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,359
But in the meantime
I'm tracking him down.

356
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:54,709
A shirt and a cap's not
a lot to go on, though.

357
00:16:54,752 --> 00:16:57,581
Just tell me we have someone
to put on the stand tomorrow.

358
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,062
Colonel Mustard with the
candlestick in the parlor.

359
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:02,543
Professor Plum, Mrs. White...

360
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:04,588
Again,

361
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:06,721
mediocre minds.

362
00:17:06,764 --> 00:17:08,070
This is Blake Lambert.

363
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:09,395
He's the one
I'd put on the stand.

364
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:11,247
- We reached out to him.
- He wants to help.

365
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,553
One of Torin's best friends.

366
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:14,163
He's known Torin
and Tally for years.

367
00:17:14,207 --> 00:17:15,469
Can speak to their history.

368
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:17,316
He was a co-host on
the party's Facebook event.

369
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,647
At the very least, he could
speak to how many people

370
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,605
were there, insinuate
that the prosecution

371
00:17:21,649 --> 00:17:23,496
may have jumped the gun
in finding their suspect.

372
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,263
I mean, there were
a hundred guests at that party.

373
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:29,352
That's 99 potential murderers.

374
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:31,528
Sounds like a fine
witness to me.

375
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:33,574
And we'll keep working.

376
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:36,925
What siblings don't fight?

377
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:38,970
Torin and Tally
argued all the time

378
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:40,711
about money,

379
00:17:40,755 --> 00:17:43,975
pizza toppings, what color
to paint the damn walls.

380
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:46,848
I've heard Tally
yell at him hundreds of times.

381
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:48,937
But she never tried to kill him.

382
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,460
She loved her brother.

383
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:52,593
So, tell me about the party.
Who was there?

384
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:54,029
Who wasn't?

385
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,205
The whole thing got out
of control pretty quickly.

386
00:17:56,249 --> 00:17:58,642
It was supposed to be,
like, 20 of our friends,

387
00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:00,644
but, I think everyone
got kind of carried away

388
00:18:00,688 --> 00:18:02,385
with the plus-one thing.

389
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:04,561
Everyone was drinking,
or doing whatever.

390
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:07,347
And at one point
I looked around and realized

391
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,523
I didn't know who
half the people were.

392
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:11,612
Now, when you say
"drinking or whatever,"

393
00:18:11,655 --> 00:18:13,004
are you referring to drugs?

394
00:18:13,048 --> 00:18:15,268
I didn't use the word "drugs."

395
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:17,966
I'm saying people were partying,

396
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:19,924
and some were partying
quite hard.

397
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:23,276
So you've got this big loft.

398
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:25,278
It's filled with people.

399
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:28,542
Many of whom you suspect
are total strangers.

400
00:18:28,585 --> 00:18:29,978
People are consuming alcohol,

401
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:32,415
maybe other things...

402
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:34,243
Isn't it reasonable to suspect

403
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:35,897
that any one
of a number of people

404
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,594
could have killed
your friend Torin?

405
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:39,292
Objection. Relevance.

406
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:40,747
Not to mention
he's leading the witness.

407
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:42,531
Not to mention
he's asking him for an opinion

408
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:44,688
based on speculation.
Not to mention...

409
00:18:44,732 --> 00:18:47,952
I get it. Objection sustained.

410
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:49,128
Mr. Colón?

411
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:51,739
No further questions.

412
00:18:51,782 --> 00:18:54,089
He did that on purpose,
didn't he?

413
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,743
He knew that
it was against the rules,

414
00:18:55,786 --> 00:18:57,547
but he wanted the jury to think
about all those other people,

415
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:58,765
how any one of them
could have done it.

416
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:00,574
Shh, you're giving away
all my secrets.

417
00:19:00,617 --> 00:19:01,575
We just jumped

418
00:19:01,618 --> 00:19:04,708
from one green juror to three.

419
00:19:04,752 --> 00:19:08,712
Mr. Lambert, I'd like
to revisit the fight

420
00:19:08,756 --> 00:19:10,932
the defendant and the victim
were having that evening.

421
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,716
Do you know what they
were fighting about?

422
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,544
I do. Torin had filed

423
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:16,807
for legal guardianship
of his sister.

424
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:19,332
Torin was very protective
of Tally.

425
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,613
Okay, but you can be
protective without

426
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:22,987
filing for guardianship.

427
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:25,468
Do you have any idea
what possessed him

428
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:27,992
to seek a court order
declaring that his sister

429
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:29,733
was unable to manage
her own affairs?

430
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:33,433
Not specifically, just that...

431
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:35,696
she was becoming
more and more of a challenge

432
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:36,827
to control.

433
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:39,569
Her safety, her spending,

434
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:41,745
her temper... I'm sorry, did you
say "her temper"?

435
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:44,226
I didn't mean it like that.

436
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,533
I-It's what I said before.
They'd argue.

437
00:19:46,576 --> 00:19:48,709
But I don't think
he was scared of her.

438
00:19:48,752 --> 00:19:50,319
I don't think anyone
was scared of her.

439
00:19:50,363 --> 00:19:53,017
More, worriedfor her.

440
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:55,759
And, I mean,
he'd tell me how, sometimes,

441
00:19:55,803 --> 00:19:59,372
she'd stay out all night.
I mean, she's...

442
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:02,723
she's beautiful. She's going
to attract attention.

443
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:04,115
It's a lot for a 28-year-old guy

444
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,336
to deal with or worry about.

445
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,338
So, I think he felt that

446
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:11,427
both of their lives
might improve

447
00:20:11,471 --> 00:20:14,691
if she were in a place
that was set up

448
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:18,652
to deal with people
with her kind of challenges.

449
00:20:18,695 --> 00:20:20,567
Torin did it

450
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,700
so that he could get her
the help that she needed.

451
00:20:23,744 --> 00:20:25,659
It was for her protection.

452
00:20:25,702 --> 00:20:27,835
Her protection? Are you sure?

453
00:20:27,878 --> 00:20:29,663
Well, what else could it be?

454
00:20:29,706 --> 00:20:32,535
Are you sure it wasn't
for his protection as well? Your Honor,

455
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:33,623
I object.

456
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:34,885
The counselor is testifying

457
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:37,845
andleading the witness and...

458
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:39,847
Thanks, Mr. Colón.
I'll take it from here.

459
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,457
Objection sustained.

460
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:43,372
Please get to the
point, Counselor.

461
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,679
Apologies, Your Honor.

462
00:20:45,722 --> 00:20:47,811
So, did Torin
tell you why he felt

463
00:20:47,855 --> 00:20:49,267
he needed protection
from his sister?

464
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,249
Objection!

465
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,686
Hearsay. No foundation.

466
00:20:52,729 --> 00:20:54,296
What are we doing here,
Your Honor?

467
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,863
Sustained.

468
00:20:55,906 --> 00:20:57,647
The ice is incredibly thin

469
00:20:57,691 --> 00:21:00,084
where you're standing,
Ms. Scrivener.

470
00:21:00,128 --> 00:21:02,043
I understand, Your Honor.

471
00:21:02,086 --> 00:21:04,045
Let's come at this another way.

472
00:21:04,088 --> 00:21:05,655
When you would
see them together,

473
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:08,136
brother and sister,
how did Torin appear...

474
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:09,790
Did he look comfortable?

475
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:13,750
Sometimes yes. Sometimes no.

476
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:14,901
What about the night
of the party...

477
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:16,362
Did he look scared?

478
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:24,065
She was smashing liquor bottles.

479
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:27,721
He looked like he was afraid
she was gonna snap

480
00:21:27,764 --> 00:21:30,114
and hurt somebody. Hurt him.

481
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:34,554
I think we all
felt the same way.

482
00:21:34,597 --> 00:21:36,860
Forget that thing I said
about three greens.

483
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:38,819
No further questions
for this witness.

484
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:43,780
I really don't have
any new news.

485
00:21:43,824 --> 00:21:47,349
Still trying to nail down
our mystery man in the red cap.

486
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:49,351
I'm still knee-deep

487
00:21:49,395 --> 00:21:51,266
in the social media of it all.

488
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,573
Trying to fill in some
of those gray boxes.

489
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,012
I really need to leave now.

490
00:21:58,055 --> 00:21:59,274
Pick up my son.

491
00:22:08,892 --> 00:22:10,894
Can I throw a crazy
idea out there?

492
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:15,334
Are we missing the obvious?

493
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:17,248
And if we weren't
representing her,

494
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:19,816
wouldn't she be our
number-one suspect?

495
00:22:21,122 --> 00:22:22,341
It's all there, Bull

496
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:25,431
Means, motive and opportunity.

497
00:22:25,474 --> 00:22:27,868
Are you sure... really sure...

498
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:29,739
That Tally didn't do it?

499
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:33,700
And if you stop for a second
to consider that maybe

500
00:22:33,743 --> 00:22:36,746
you think she's
innocent just because

501
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,854
you want her to be innocent.

502
00:22:37,878 --> 00:22:40,271
Easy, Chunk.

503
00:22:40,315 --> 00:22:42,119
You keep saying that she
couldn't have done this.

504
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:44,450
And that even if she did do it,

505
00:22:44,493 --> 00:22:47,888
she never would've reversed
course to try to save him,

506
00:22:47,931 --> 00:22:51,500
because that requires empathy,
and she doesn't have that.

507
00:22:51,544 --> 00:22:53,328
But maybe she tried
to stop the bleeding

508
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,330
to save herself.

509
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,550
Maybe she regretted
what she'd done

510
00:22:57,593 --> 00:22:59,900
because she didn't
want to get caught.

511
00:23:01,945 --> 00:23:03,817
I'm sorry.

512
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,036
But... Nothing to be sorry for.

513
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,822
I pay you to tell me
what you think.

514
00:23:08,865 --> 00:23:11,433
Thank you.

515
00:23:11,477 --> 00:23:13,000
You done?

516
00:23:14,305 --> 00:23:15,437
Yeah.

517
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:17,874
Excellent.
I will see you all tomorrow.

518
00:23:31,975 --> 00:23:35,065
You know, it took a lot
of courage for him to do that.

519
00:23:41,115 --> 00:23:43,639
Prosecution's newest exhibit.

520
00:23:43,683 --> 00:23:45,336
They're presenting it tomorrow.

521
00:23:47,382 --> 00:23:50,167
Why didn't they send
this in last week?

522
00:23:50,211 --> 00:23:51,647
Because it didn't
exist last week.

523
00:23:51,691 --> 00:23:52,996
Guards did a sweep

524
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,521
of Tally's cell this morning,
and there it was.

525
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:00,874
W-What is it?

526
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,708
Well, at least we know
the jury won't be out long.

527
00:24:10,753 --> 00:24:13,277
You want to tell me
what I'm looking at here?

528
00:24:14,365 --> 00:24:16,933
I was just doing
what you taught me.

529
00:24:16,977 --> 00:24:18,805
Fill in the blanks.

530
00:24:18,848 --> 00:24:21,416
When you have a blackout, sketch
the things you know, and then

531
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,984
try and sketch
the things you don't.

532
00:24:25,072 --> 00:24:26,595
Make the unconscious conscious,

533
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:28,815
isn't that what
you always told me?

534
00:24:28,858 --> 00:24:31,010
The only things I know are the
things I'm hearing in court,

535
00:24:31,034 --> 00:24:34,298
so I started there.

536
00:24:34,342 --> 00:24:36,126
Just trying to process
the memory loss,

537
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,172
see if it would jog something.

538
00:24:38,215 --> 00:24:40,261
For the record, it didn't.

539
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:46,223
Tally.

540
00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:49,226
I think I may have
given you some horrible advice.

541
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,098
What do you mean?

542
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:54,101
I think I inadvertently
had you draw yourself

543
00:24:54,144 --> 00:24:55,494
into a guilty verdict.

544
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:04,503
Miss North...

545
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:06,722
you don't deny that those
are your drawings, do you?

546
00:25:06,766 --> 00:25:08,724
No, no. They're mine.

547
00:25:08,768 --> 00:25:11,510
And you know,
more often than not,

548
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:13,729
people accused of murder

549
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:16,819
do not testify
at their own trials?

550
00:25:16,863 --> 00:25:19,256
The law does not
require them to,

551
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,129
but you chose to try
and explain the drawings

552
00:25:22,172 --> 00:25:24,107
and to answer questions
about your brother's murder,

553
00:25:24,131 --> 00:25:25,349
isn't that correct?

554
00:25:25,393 --> 00:25:26,742
Yes.

555
00:25:26,786 --> 00:25:30,354
Tell us about these drawings.

556
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:33,575
Well, I've always drawn.

557
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:36,535
Ever since I could
hold a crayon.

558
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:37,840
And my art has

559
00:25:37,884 --> 00:25:40,669
always tended
to be dark, violent.

560
00:25:40,713 --> 00:25:43,716
It actually used to worry me.

561
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:45,587
And just to be clear,
the drawings that depict

562
00:25:45,631 --> 00:25:47,676
your brother's murder were drawn

563
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,853
after you were jailed, correct?

564
00:25:50,897 --> 00:25:53,203
After you were
charged with Torin's murder,

565
00:25:53,247 --> 00:25:54,596
after the trial started?

566
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,642
Yes, sir.So...

567
00:25:58,644 --> 00:25:59,993
This isn't you...

568
00:26:00,036 --> 00:26:02,909
planning your brother's death...

569
00:26:02,952 --> 00:26:05,041
fantasizing about killing him,

570
00:26:05,085 --> 00:26:06,826
imagining what it would be like?

571
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:08,741
No.

572
00:26:08,784 --> 00:26:11,439
It's just me taking
elements of the murder,

573
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:13,267
things I had heard
about here in court

574
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:16,226
and piecing them together to see
if it would help me remember.

575
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,489
Remember what?

576
00:26:19,534 --> 00:26:21,318
Anything.

577
00:26:21,362 --> 00:26:24,670
I have absolutely no memory
of anything that happened

578
00:26:24,713 --> 00:26:27,629
after I went to my bedroom,
after our disagreement.

579
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:31,590
Up until I woke up and found
my brother dead on the floor.

580
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,461
You sure about this
next move, Bull?

581
00:26:33,504 --> 00:26:34,854
"Sure" is a strong word.

582
00:26:34,897 --> 00:26:37,073
I prefer
"what other choice do we have."

583
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:46,909
Tally...

584
00:26:46,953 --> 00:26:49,390
are you sad your brother's dead?

585
00:26:51,174 --> 00:26:52,828
No.

586
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:58,660
If I were you, I'd pull
a couple of dollar bills

587
00:26:58,704 --> 00:27:00,333
out of my wallet
and stare at 'em, 'cause that's

588
00:27:00,357 --> 00:27:02,664
the last green you're gonna
be seeing for a while.Order.

589
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:05,232
Order, please.

590
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,020
Do you want to explain?

591
00:27:12,065 --> 00:27:13,588
Look, I know it must be hard

592
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,721
to understand how I work.

593
00:27:15,764 --> 00:27:18,724
What goes on in my head.

594
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:21,248
I just don't feel
the same things you do.

595
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:23,685
I don't get happy.

596
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:26,645
I don't get sad.

597
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:30,300
I find it really hard to care
about anyone other than myself.

598
00:27:35,262 --> 00:27:38,134
Of course...

599
00:27:38,178 --> 00:27:40,571
I can make you think I care.

600
00:27:51,191 --> 00:27:53,628
But it's a trick.

601
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,587
Something I learned
when I was very young.

602
00:27:56,631 --> 00:27:59,721
I could do it
when I fell off my bike, or...

603
00:27:59,765 --> 00:28:02,028
when I didn't get something
I wanted for my birthday.

604
00:28:02,071 --> 00:28:04,857
And then one day I realized,

605
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:09,122
"This is what
they wanted me to do

606
00:28:09,165 --> 00:28:11,646
"when my goldfish died.

607
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,736
I can do that for them."

608
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,564
And before you ask,

609
00:28:16,607 --> 00:28:18,131
yes.

610
00:28:18,174 --> 00:28:20,176
I know something is missing.

611
00:28:21,395 --> 00:28:24,267
Something is broken.

612
00:28:24,311 --> 00:28:25,573
Wrong.

613
00:28:26,617 --> 00:28:29,882
And I feel really
lonely because of that.

614
00:28:29,925 --> 00:28:33,755
I'm a part of a world
that I don't totally understand.

615
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:36,671
And one that, for the most part,

616
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,674
seems really frightened of me.

617
00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:48,639
So I'm gonna ask you once again.

618
00:28:48,683 --> 00:28:51,773
Tally, are you sad
that your brother's dead?

619
00:28:51,817 --> 00:28:54,776
My brother was the only person
who ever loved me.

620
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,738
He just did.

621
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:02,175
Even though
I couldn't love him back.

622
00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:09,791
Why would I want
to make that go away?

623
00:29:11,837 --> 00:29:15,188
My goodness,
we just picked up a green.

624
00:29:15,231 --> 00:29:16,667
You sound surprised.

625
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:20,019
I told you I was sure
it would work.

626
00:29:20,062 --> 00:29:22,325
My goodness, Ms. North,
you've had a lot of therapists

627
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:23,674
in your short life, haven't you?

628
00:29:23,718 --> 00:29:26,590
Relatively speaking, I suppose.

629
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:28,767
And isn't it true
that one of your therapists

630
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,682
is now part of your
defense team, Dr. Jason Bull?

631
00:29:33,162 --> 00:29:34,685
It is.

632
00:29:34,729 --> 00:29:36,296
Can you identify him for us?

633
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:37,645
He's sitting right there.

634
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:41,127
I'd like to play a video excerpt

635
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:44,043
from a session that you and
Dr. Bull had in June of 2003.

636
00:29:44,086 --> 00:29:46,393
I believe your aunt just died

637
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:49,265
in a car accident.

638
00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:52,573
I can't believe she's dead.

639
00:29:52,616 --> 00:29:54,401
I miss her so much.

640
00:29:54,444 --> 00:29:56,490
Okay, Tally. Stop it.

641
00:29:56,533 --> 00:29:57,839
You're wasting my time.

642
00:29:57,883 --> 00:29:58,903
You're manufacturing
your response,

643
00:29:58,927 --> 00:30:00,755
not feeling an emotion.

644
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,409
What are you talking about?

645
00:30:02,452 --> 00:30:04,803
She was my favorite aunt,
and I don't know

646
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:06,805
how I'm gonna go on living.

647
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,982
I have every confidence
you'll find a way.

648
00:30:11,505 --> 00:30:13,550
You always know, don't you?

649
00:30:13,594 --> 00:30:14,682
That's my job, Tally.

650
00:30:14,725 --> 00:30:17,076
Now tell me what
you're really feeling.

651
00:30:18,904 --> 00:30:20,819
How can you expect this jury

652
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:22,211
to believe a word you say

653
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:24,474
when you freely
confess to this jury,

654
00:30:24,518 --> 00:30:26,215
freely confess to your
own therapist...

655
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:27,913
Now a member
of your defense team...

656
00:30:27,956 --> 00:30:29,218
That your word,

657
00:30:29,262 --> 00:30:31,960
your behavior, can't be trusted?

658
00:30:32,004 --> 00:30:34,223
That it's just a means
to an end, something that

659
00:30:34,267 --> 00:30:36,704
you do because you know
other people expect it?

660
00:30:36,747 --> 00:30:37,923
Objection, Your Honor.

661
00:30:37,966 --> 00:30:40,229
Is the prosecutor
going to ask a question

662
00:30:40,273 --> 00:30:41,927
or continue giving
her closing argument

663
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:43,493
in the middle of the trial?

664
00:30:43,537 --> 00:30:45,321
Objection sustained.
The jury will disregard.

665
00:30:45,365 --> 00:30:47,323
A.D.A. Scrivener's
last statement.

666
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:49,108
No, they won't.

667
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:50,849
Ask a question, Counselor.

668
00:30:50,892 --> 00:30:53,242
I have no further questions,
Your Honor.

669
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,857
Hey.

670
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,911
Gracias. No, no,
no, no. Come on.

671
00:31:09,955 --> 00:31:11,217
Don't you dare.Okay. All right.

672
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,827
Don't you dare.

673
00:31:17,571 --> 00:31:18,920
Why don't you just use a card?

674
00:31:20,226 --> 00:31:22,184
You know, I just
have so much extra cash

675
00:31:22,228 --> 00:31:24,056
lying around,
I would feel stupid

676
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:25,709
if I didn't use it. Gracias.

677
00:31:25,753 --> 00:31:27,929
I'm serious.

678
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:30,845
I mean, it's not like
you work at a toll booth

679
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,151
and take home free samples.

680
00:31:32,194 --> 00:31:34,327
How come I've never seen
you use a credit card?

681
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:35,937
Yeah, well, I'm taking it slow.

682
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:38,853
You know, I show you
all my fascinating aspects...

683
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:42,117
My-my credit cards,
my 401, my yacht...

684
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:43,771
I show you all that too soon,

685
00:31:43,814 --> 00:31:46,295
there won't be
any mystery left, you know?

686
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:50,082
One second.

687
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:52,084
It's work.

688
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:54,260
Man, you know, every time
I'm convinced they're not

689
00:31:54,303 --> 00:31:56,740
coming back to the office
after court, they do.

690
00:31:56,784 --> 00:32:00,179
And every time I'm sure they're
coming back, they don't.

691
00:32:00,222 --> 00:32:03,922
I'm sorry. I got to go. It's okay.

692
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:06,620
Next time on me. Yes.

693
00:32:09,014 --> 00:32:12,843
Yeah. And next time
maybe I'll show you my yacht.

694
00:32:13,888 --> 00:32:15,194
So I was able

695
00:32:15,237 --> 00:32:17,674
to ID our mystery man
in the red baseball cap.

696
00:32:17,718 --> 00:32:19,720
The thing is,
he's not our killer.

697
00:32:19,763 --> 00:32:20,827
His name is Brian Davidson.

698
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:22,897
And he left the party
around 1100,

699
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,987
then he got arrested at 1230.

700
00:32:26,031 --> 00:32:28,424
The murder happened
around 300 a.m.

701
00:32:28,468 --> 00:32:31,471
So unless he snuck out of jail
to do it, he's not our guy.

702
00:32:31,514 --> 00:32:32,994
What was he arrested for?

703
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:34,691
Selling drugs.

704
00:32:34,735 --> 00:32:37,477
Marijuana, cocaine,
MDMA, roofies.

705
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,305
Roofies?

706
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,744
Tally keeps insisting
the blackout

707
00:32:43,787 --> 00:32:46,312
she had at the party
felt different.

708
00:32:46,355 --> 00:32:49,489
Normally, she has fragments
of memory from her fugues,

709
00:32:49,532 --> 00:32:50,881
but this last one...

710
00:32:50,925 --> 00:32:52,492
Are you thinking
maybe Tally wasn't

711
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:54,189
in a dissociative fugue at all?

712
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:56,975
That maybe she was roofied?

713
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:59,499
You think this Brian Davidson's
still in custody?

714
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:00,891
I'm sure of it.

715
00:33:00,935 --> 00:33:02,175
I feel like paying him a visit.

716
00:33:07,637 --> 00:33:08,725
Mr. Lambert,

717
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:10,597
any idea why we called you back?

718
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,773
None whatsoever.

719
00:33:12,816 --> 00:33:14,383
Brian Davidson,

720
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:17,473
a man arrested
for the possession

721
00:33:17,517 --> 00:33:19,693
of illegal narcotics
shortly after

722
00:33:19,736 --> 00:33:22,652
leaving the party the evening
Torin North was killed,

723
00:33:22,696 --> 00:33:25,046
identified you

724
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:28,702
as having purchased
flunitrazepam from him.

725
00:33:28,745 --> 00:33:30,704
You, and only you.

726
00:33:30,747 --> 00:33:32,836
I mean, other people

727
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,795
purchased other drugs,

728
00:33:34,838 --> 00:33:38,625
but only you purchased
flunitrazepam from him.

729
00:33:38,668 --> 00:33:42,063
You know what flunitrazepam is,
don't you?

730
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:44,674
No, I'm not sure I do.

731
00:33:44,718 --> 00:33:47,764
Roofies.
Flunitrazepam is roofies.

732
00:33:47,808 --> 00:33:49,810
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance?

733
00:33:49,853 --> 00:33:52,160
Mr. North didn't die of
a flunitrazepam overdose.

734
00:33:52,204 --> 00:33:55,990
I know this seems
a little out of the blue,

735
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,993
but I promise it will all
prove completely relevant

736
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:02,301
if Your Honor would just let me
get to where I need to go.

737
00:34:02,344 --> 00:34:04,651
Objection overruled.
Continue, Mr. Colón.

738
00:34:04,694 --> 00:34:06,653
Thank you, Your Honor.

739
00:34:06,696 --> 00:34:08,829
Mr. Lambert, did you, in fact,

740
00:34:08,872 --> 00:34:12,093
purchase roofies that night?

741
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:13,877
Well, yeah,

742
00:34:13,921 --> 00:34:16,402
when you call them
roofies, yeah.

743
00:34:18,578 --> 00:34:22,364
May I ask why
you purchased roofies?

744
00:34:22,408 --> 00:34:26,064
Well, I have trouble
sleeping when I drink.

745
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:28,414
They knock me out.

746
00:34:28,457 --> 00:34:32,374
Seems like a rather
extreme solution.

747
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:34,724
So be it.

748
00:34:34,768 --> 00:34:37,640
So, tell me,
did you use these roofies

749
00:34:37,684 --> 00:34:40,426
while you were at the party?

750
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:43,777
No. I waited till I got home.

751
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,170
Till it was time to go to sleep.

752
00:34:45,213 --> 00:34:47,998
Did you perhaps
inadvertently give some roofies

753
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:49,783
to anyone else that evening?

754
00:34:49,826 --> 00:34:51,915
Slip them
in their drink, perhaps?

755
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:54,875
No. O-Of course not.
Why would I do that?

756
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:58,357
Well, it is also called
the date rape drug.

757
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,576
Your Honor,
where are we going with this?

758
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,361
Mr. Colón, I need you bring this

759
00:35:02,404 --> 00:35:03,773
to some sort
of meaningful conclusion.

760
00:35:03,797 --> 00:35:07,061
Yes, Your Honor.
Of course, Your Honor.

761
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,064
Mr. Lambert,
is it your testimony

762
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,328
that the only person
who consumed these roofies

763
00:35:13,372 --> 00:35:15,852
you purchased that evening
was yourself?

764
00:35:15,896 --> 00:35:19,160
As far as I'm aware, yes.

765
00:35:19,204 --> 00:35:22,294
Your Honor, I'd like
to introduce into evidence

766
00:35:22,337 --> 00:35:23,947
this party cup

767
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:26,776
taken from the defendant's room

768
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,126
at the night of the murder.

769
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:29,910
Objection, Your Honor.
Foundation?

770
00:35:29,953 --> 00:35:33,653
I refer exhibit 172,

771
00:35:33,696 --> 00:35:36,569
a time-stamped crime scene photo

772
00:35:36,612 --> 00:35:40,050
showing this cup originally
found in the room.

773
00:35:40,094 --> 00:35:42,052
This is one and the same.

774
00:35:42,096 --> 00:35:43,663
I'll allow it.

775
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:44,944
Yeah, we'll also be introducing

776
00:35:44,968 --> 00:35:48,102
into evidence a report,
Your Honor, detailing

777
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,886
that trace amounts
of flunitrazepam

778
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:52,237
were found inside of the cup,

779
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,717
as well as Blake Lambert's
fingerprints,

780
00:35:54,761 --> 00:35:57,459
which were found on the outside.

781
00:35:57,503 --> 00:35:59,722
And there was another
set of fingerprints

782
00:35:59,766 --> 00:36:02,290
that were found on
there, too, Mr. Lambert.

783
00:36:02,334 --> 00:36:04,118
Tally North's.

784
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,382
Okay. Maybe she handed me
the cup or something.

785
00:36:07,426 --> 00:36:08,818
I don't remember.

786
00:36:08,862 --> 00:36:10,951
Did you drug Tally North?

787
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:17,262
Let the witness answer, please.

788
00:36:19,742 --> 00:36:21,222
No.

789
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:23,920
No.

790
00:36:23,964 --> 00:36:26,401
Do you happen
to remember a woman

791
00:36:26,445 --> 00:36:29,056
by the name of Leah Carpenter?

792
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:30,797
Objection.

793
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,015
Again, relevance?

794
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:33,930
Your Honor, please.

795
00:36:33,974 --> 00:36:36,846
I promise we're almost there.

796
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:40,241
Overruled. Witness will
answer the question.

797
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:43,549
Yes.

798
00:36:43,592 --> 00:36:45,115
Yes! Yes.

799
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:47,205
She attended
Rennich University with you,

800
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:49,381
and she accused you
of date rape.

801
00:36:49,424 --> 00:36:51,861
Putting something in her drink,
then following her back

802
00:36:51,905 --> 00:36:55,909
to her dorm room and holding
her down and you know the rest.

803
00:36:55,952 --> 00:36:57,258
This is completely unfair.

804
00:36:57,302 --> 00:37:00,261
That was just...
that was a misunderstanding.

805
00:37:00,305 --> 00:37:02,394
No one pressed charges.

806
00:37:02,437 --> 00:37:04,134
We have their full attention,

807
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:07,050
but we sill haven't
changed enough minds.

808
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:08,835
Trust me,
their minds are changed.

809
00:37:08,878 --> 00:37:10,238
They're just
too damned entertained

810
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:12,055
to take a minute
and let us know.

811
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:13,231
The night of the party,

812
00:37:13,274 --> 00:37:14,928
did you follow Tally
back to her room?

813
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:16,799
No.Did you hold her down?

814
00:37:16,843 --> 00:37:19,149
No.Did you rip her shirt?
Bruise her skin?

815
00:37:19,193 --> 00:37:22,979
No.Did Torin, her brother Torin...
Your best friend Torin...

816
00:37:23,023 --> 00:37:26,156
Walk in on you taking advantage
of his comatose sister?!

817
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,158
No, no, no!

818
00:37:28,202 --> 00:37:30,204
You can't prove that!

819
00:37:34,121 --> 00:37:36,123
Nothing further, Your Honor.

820
00:37:40,606 --> 00:37:42,564
Reasonable doubt.

821
00:37:42,608 --> 00:37:46,002
You look it up
in the dictionary,

822
00:37:46,046 --> 00:37:49,789
and there'd be a picture
of all of us sitting here today.

823
00:37:49,832 --> 00:37:52,574
There'd also be a definition.

824
00:37:53,836 --> 00:37:56,274
Something along the lines of...

825
00:37:56,317 --> 00:37:59,146
"Lack of proof

826
00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:01,322
"that prevents a judge or a jury

827
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:04,238
"from convicting a defendant

828
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,762
for the charged crime."

829
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:09,765
Only Torin North and his killer

830
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:12,942
know exactly what happened
in that room.

831
00:38:12,986 --> 00:38:16,119
But you've heard
all the evidence.

832
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,340
Or have you?

833
00:38:19,384 --> 00:38:21,734
I've yet to hear
a single piece of evidence

834
00:38:21,777 --> 00:38:24,693
that points
to my client having done this.

835
00:38:24,737 --> 00:38:28,480
But I've heard a great deal
to suggest an alternate theory.

836
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:31,178
I believe that...

837
00:38:31,221 --> 00:38:33,049
Torin walked in

838
00:38:33,093 --> 00:38:36,052
on his best friend Blake Lambert

839
00:38:36,096 --> 00:38:40,100
standing over
his semi-conscious sister.

840
00:38:40,143 --> 00:38:41,971
Her shirt ripped,

841
00:38:42,015 --> 00:38:44,974
her arms bruised. And he was

842
00:38:45,018 --> 00:38:47,281
fiercely protective
of his sister.

843
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:51,024
So he did
what any brother would do.

844
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:54,027
Blake fought back.

845
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:57,335
Grabbed the scissors
from Tally's desk

846
00:38:57,378 --> 00:38:59,946
and plunged them
into his best friend's neck.

847
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:03,297
And as Torin's blood spilled
on an unconscious Tally,

848
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,386
he had a moment of regret.

849
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,649
He doesn't suffer from ASPD...

850
00:39:07,693 --> 00:39:09,390
Antisocial personality disorder.

851
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:11,000
No.

852
00:39:11,044 --> 00:39:13,133
No, no.

853
00:39:13,176 --> 00:39:16,005
He's just
an old-fashioned rapist

854
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:18,051
who suddenly realized

855
00:39:18,094 --> 00:39:20,053
that he might have
killed his best friend,

856
00:39:20,096 --> 00:39:22,098
so he tried to stop
the bleeding.

857
00:39:22,142 --> 00:39:24,405
Realized that
wasn't going to work,

858
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:27,626
so he wiped the murder weapon,

859
00:39:27,669 --> 00:39:31,064
and left Tally
passed out on the bed.

860
00:39:31,107 --> 00:39:33,849
So that when she came to,

861
00:39:33,893 --> 00:39:37,070
confronted with
her brother's slain body,

862
00:39:37,113 --> 00:39:38,854
and having no memory
of what happened

863
00:39:38,898 --> 00:39:40,552
due to the flunitrazepam,

864
00:39:40,595 --> 00:39:44,077
she'd be forced
to carry around the knowledge

865
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,471
that she might have done this.

866
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:49,256
That it was her fault,

867
00:39:49,299 --> 00:39:51,040
her doing,

868
00:39:51,084 --> 00:39:53,478
her crime.

869
00:39:54,957 --> 00:39:57,177
But she didn't.

870
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,961
She didn't do it.

871
00:39:59,005 --> 00:40:02,443
Tally is simply
just another victim, and-and...

872
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:05,446
what an obscene joke that is.

873
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:08,928
You know, the person
responsible for this crime

874
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:11,844
is trusting that you, the jury,

875
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:14,455
will lean on your
own preconceived notions

876
00:40:14,499 --> 00:40:17,850
on what it means
to be a sociopath,

877
00:40:17,893 --> 00:40:20,069
what it means to be
devoid of emotion,

878
00:40:20,113 --> 00:40:23,464
what it means
to be mentally ill.

879
00:40:23,508 --> 00:40:26,554
The killer's counting on it.

880
00:40:26,598 --> 00:40:28,948
And so is the A.D.A.

881
00:40:30,776 --> 00:40:33,561
But Tally and I
know you know better.

882
00:40:33,605 --> 00:40:36,129
In fact, she's betting
her life on it.

883
00:40:36,172 --> 00:40:37,522
Thank you.

884
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,878
Has the jury reached a verdict?

885
00:40:45,921 --> 00:40:48,141
We have, Your Honor.

886
00:40:48,184 --> 00:40:50,143
We, the jury,
find the defendant,

887
00:40:50,186 --> 00:40:52,232
Tally North...

888
00:40:52,275 --> 00:40:55,104
not guilty
of the murder of Torin North.

889
00:40:58,194 --> 00:41:00,153
It's okay.

890
00:41:00,196 --> 00:41:02,198
It's about you.

891
00:41:05,854 --> 00:41:08,466
So what happens now?

892
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:11,294
I found something

893
00:41:11,338 --> 00:41:13,296
that I'd like you to consider.

894
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,908
It's a residential facility.

895
00:41:15,951 --> 00:41:17,910
No locks. You can leave
any time you want.

896
00:41:17,953 --> 00:41:20,042
Just sign yourself out.

897
00:41:20,086 --> 00:41:22,044
It's all in your control.

898
00:41:22,088 --> 00:41:23,872
But you have a room there.

899
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:26,135
Everything is set
and ready for you,

900
00:41:26,179 --> 00:41:29,443
and if it's not the right fit,
we'll find you something else.

901
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:33,273
It's what your brother
wanted for you...

902
00:41:33,316 --> 00:41:36,798
To get back to that sense
of feigned normalcy.

903
00:41:36,842 --> 00:41:38,408
Feigned normalcy.

904
00:41:38,452 --> 00:41:40,585
Something we can all aspire to.

905
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:44,197
You know, when you left me
all those years ago,

906
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,242
I understood.

907
00:41:46,286 --> 00:41:49,071
I didn't like it, but..

908
00:41:49,115 --> 00:41:50,551
I understood.

909
00:41:50,595 --> 00:41:53,946
And I also felt,
strongly, somehow,

910
00:41:53,989 --> 00:41:57,776
that... you weren't
really gone forever.

911
00:41:59,734 --> 00:42:01,257
And you weren't.

912
00:42:04,217 --> 00:42:06,567
Thank you for being there.

913
00:42:12,312 --> 00:42:14,575
Tally...

914
00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:16,534
thank you for saying that.

915
00:42:18,361 --> 00:42:20,189
I'm just messing with you.

916
00:42:20,233 --> 00:42:22,583
So where's this place

917
00:42:22,627 --> 00:42:25,020
you want me to try?

918
00:42:25,064 --> 00:42:26,239
Well...

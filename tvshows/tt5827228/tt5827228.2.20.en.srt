2
00:00:44,697 --> 00:00:47,098
Your car is... 17 minutes away.

3
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:02,313
Guess what I did today.

4
00:01:02,315 --> 00:01:05,007
I played hooky.

5
00:01:05,284 --> 00:01:08,252
Had my teaching assistant
cover my two classes.

6
00:01:08,254 --> 00:01:10,654
And I went to a pub, sat by myself

7
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:14,266
and read something
that I did not have to read.

8
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:20,431
What the hell are you doing over there?

9
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:28,405
Where are you going?

10
00:01:28,407 --> 00:01:30,374
Not going anywhere.

11
00:01:30,376 --> 00:01:34,111
I just thought this thing takes
up so much room in the closet.

12
00:01:34,113 --> 00:01:36,213
Might make more sense keeping it...

13
00:01:36,215 --> 00:01:39,283
under the bed, but... doesn't fit.

14
00:01:39,285 --> 00:01:40,918
Really?

15
00:01:47,226 --> 00:01:49,426
Not going anywhere?

16
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,331
Who do you think
you're messing with...

17
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,666
Haven't we...

18
00:01:55,668 --> 00:01:57,735
already been through this?

19
00:01:57,737 --> 00:02:00,137
I wasn't... I needed to
get away for a bit

20
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:02,606
just to... to write and to think.

21
00:02:02,608 --> 00:02:04,441
That's a bunch of crap, Kate.

22
00:02:04,443 --> 00:02:07,511
That is a bunch of crap!

23
00:02:08,814 --> 00:02:10,614
We both know that you don't write.

24
00:02:10,616 --> 00:02:12,449
Okay, buying garbage on the Internet

25
00:02:12,451 --> 00:02:15,519
that you don't need is not writing.

26
00:02:15,521 --> 00:02:20,024
Reading articles that other
people wrote is not writing.

27
00:02:20,026 --> 00:02:22,326
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:22,328 --> 00:02:24,795
I should have... I should have told you,

29
00:02:24,797 --> 00:02:27,431
not surprised you.

30
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:31,035
I just... I knew you'd be upset.

31
00:02:32,305 --> 00:02:34,405
You have any idea

32
00:02:34,407 --> 00:02:38,008
how stupid that accent makes you sound?

33
00:02:38,678 --> 00:02:41,212
Say it again.

34
00:02:43,249 --> 00:02:46,083
Say "I'm sorry," and say
it without the accent.

35
00:02:48,321 --> 00:02:50,054
I'm... sorry.

36
00:02:51,543 --> 00:02:54,124
I'm so s-sorry.

37
00:02:55,995 --> 00:02:57,452
Okay.

38
00:02:57,997 --> 00:02:59,496
You can do it.

39
00:03:00,872 --> 00:03:02,533
Let's see what else you can do.

40
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:18,983
No.

41
00:03:18,985 --> 00:03:21,351
No, this is Kate Martin's
husband. Who's this?

42
00:03:21,977 --> 00:03:24,488
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,590
Yeah, she changed her mind.

44
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,826
Yeah, Kate Martin isn't
going anywhere today.

45
00:03:36,602 --> 00:03:39,036
Katie, what are you doing?

46
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:42,205
Doesn't matter where you go.

47
00:03:43,042 --> 00:03:44,666
I'm gonna find you...

48
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:47,678
and I'll bring you back here.

49
00:03:51,048 --> 00:03:52,616
I did it before.

50
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:56,920
I'll do it again.

51
00:05:08,427 --> 00:05:10,427
Hey, where's Benny?

52
00:05:10,836 --> 00:05:12,129
Downstairs, I think.

53
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:13,397
All right.

54
00:05:14,005 --> 00:05:15,251
And that's...

55
00:05:15,253 --> 00:05:16,600
that's an amazing gift.

56
00:05:16,602 --> 00:05:18,068
Well, she's an amazing girl.

57
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,370
Benny?

58
00:05:19,372 --> 00:05:21,405
Your sister called me
three times last night.

59
00:05:21,407 --> 00:05:23,040
Hung up before I could answer.

60
00:05:23,432 --> 00:05:24,632
Something I should know about?

61
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,379
You got me, but if she called
you, you should call her.

62
00:05:28,381 --> 00:05:31,189
I did. I left a couple of
voicemails; She never returned.

63
00:05:32,385 --> 00:05:34,518
Can't be an alimony thing.

64
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,553
I mean, it's not an alimony thing, right?

65
00:05:36,555 --> 00:05:38,722
I have no idea, but you know Izzy.

66
00:05:38,724 --> 00:05:40,224
She's not shy.

67
00:05:40,226 --> 00:05:42,426
If she has something important
to tell you...

68
00:05:42,428 --> 00:05:45,396
Point taken. Yeah..

69
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:52,736
Good morning to you, too.

70
00:05:52,738 --> 00:05:55,072
Sorry. I just have a bad
feeling about something.

71
00:05:55,074 --> 00:05:56,473
Well, I want to warn you.

72
00:05:56,475 --> 00:05:58,308
I-I just put Dr. Grint in your office.

73
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,110
Dr. Grint from the
Survivors' Justice Project?

74
00:06:00,112 --> 00:06:01,345
Is she looking for money?

75
00:06:01,347 --> 00:06:03,847
- I have no idea.
- 'Cause now is not the time.

76
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:06,316
Izzy's been calling me, and
I... I just have a sense

77
00:06:06,318 --> 00:06:07,918
something's up, and it's gonna cost me.

78
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,454
All I know is she said it was important.

79
00:06:10,456 --> 00:06:12,623
Okay.

80
00:06:14,565 --> 00:06:16,894
Dr. Grint. Marian.

81
00:06:16,896 --> 00:06:19,296
For the millionth time... Marian.

82
00:06:19,298 --> 00:06:22,111
What can I do for you... Marian?

83
00:06:22,112 --> 00:06:25,346
Dr. Bull, you once told me
if I ever needed a favor...

84
00:06:25,348 --> 00:06:26,981
I've been seeing her on
and off for two years,

85
00:06:26,983 --> 00:06:28,283
urging her to get out.

86
00:06:28,285 --> 00:06:30,418
- And of course she didn't.
- Of course she didn't.

87
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,053
Now she's being charged with murder.

88
00:06:32,055 --> 00:06:34,255
Well, that's what happens
when you kill someone.

89
00:06:34,257 --> 00:06:36,391
She's been appointed a public defender.

90
00:06:36,393 --> 00:06:37,592
Sounds about right.

91
00:06:37,594 --> 00:06:40,161
And I was hoping you
might whisper in his ear

92
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:42,393
about juries and who to look for

93
00:06:42,395 --> 00:06:43,592
and all that good stuff that

94
00:06:43,617 --> 00:06:44,820
you're so wonderful at.

95
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:46,367
Happy to do it, but the truth is,

96
00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:48,436
I'm sure whoever they've given
your client is more

97
00:06:48,438 --> 00:06:50,672
than up to the task,
and I don't need to tell you,

98
00:06:50,674 --> 00:06:53,241
the courts see a lot
of these kinds of cases.

99
00:06:53,243 --> 00:06:56,311
And there's nothing unusual
or exotic about it.

100
00:06:56,313 --> 00:06:58,246
She shot him in the back.

101
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,916
Okay. That makes it
a touch more complicated,

102
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:04,319
but presumably,
it was self-defense, so...

103
00:07:04,321 --> 00:07:06,521
While he was fast asleep.

104
00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:10,225
That's a tough one.

105
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,186
What have we here?

106
00:07:16,294 --> 00:07:18,689
Dr. Jason Bull, this is Mark Burns.

107
00:07:18,691 --> 00:07:21,359
Mark has been appointed
Kate's public defender.

108
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,594
Mark, Dr. Jason Bull.

109
00:07:23,596 --> 00:07:26,330
I'm, just here to help.
It's your show.

110
00:07:26,332 --> 00:07:28,499
Well, it's pretty cut and dried.
It's not rocket science.

111
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:30,206
It's one of those stories
I can pretty much

112
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,303
tell you the ending of
right now, but I'm happy

113
00:07:32,305 --> 00:07:33,938
to listen to anything you have to say.

114
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,573
Is she with us?

115
00:07:35,575 --> 00:07:38,075
That's the enemy.

116
00:07:38,077 --> 00:07:40,211
That's A.D.A. Amy Lake.
She's a tough one.

117
00:07:40,213 --> 00:07:41,812
But I've been talking to her,

118
00:07:41,814 --> 00:07:43,748
seeing if we can't find
some common ground.

119
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,279
What's she doing here?

120
00:07:45,281 --> 00:07:47,066
Same thing I'm doing,
waiting for the judge.

121
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:48,737
The girl's banged up pretty good.

122
00:07:48,738 --> 00:07:50,772
She's got a couple of broken
ribs and a punctured lung.

123
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:52,473
They're still doing some tests, but...

124
00:07:52,475 --> 00:07:55,543
they want to do the arraignment
here in the hospital.

125
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,380
You think I can have
a few minutes with her?

126
00:07:59,382 --> 00:08:01,057
The accused, I mean?

127
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,863
Of course.

128
00:08:11,141 --> 00:08:12,293
Sorry.

129
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:14,728
I should have warned you.

130
00:08:16,146 --> 00:08:18,399
They do look somewhat alike, don't they?

131
00:08:20,473 --> 00:08:21,636
She and her husband

132
00:08:21,638 --> 00:08:23,404
have been married almost four years.

133
00:08:23,406 --> 00:08:25,173
He taught writing at Hudson.

134
00:08:25,175 --> 00:08:28,176
Apparently, he's one
of their most popular teachers.

135
00:08:29,846 --> 00:08:31,813
It didn't help that he was smart.

136
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:34,649
He only hit her in places
that clothing covered...

137
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,384
until now.

138
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,022
And she was the kind of wife...
never went to the police.

139
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,827
She went to the emergency
room once last year.

140
00:08:46,217 --> 00:08:48,463
Paid cash, gave a false name.

141
00:08:48,465 --> 00:08:50,013
Still.

142
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:52,800
He was sleeping.

143
00:08:52,802 --> 00:08:55,003
It's really gonna be a tough sell.

144
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,940
Why now?

145
00:09:00,377 --> 00:09:02,543
You her family?

146
00:09:02,545 --> 00:09:05,280
If she wakes up, tell her
we just got the test back.

147
00:09:05,987 --> 00:09:07,382
The baby's fine.

148
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:16,391
Aren't we being a little dramatic?

149
00:09:16,998 --> 00:09:18,593
You got something
against hospital cafeterias?

150
00:09:18,595 --> 00:09:21,696
They serve coffee. They have... walls.

151
00:09:23,004 --> 00:09:24,532
Did you know she was pregnant?

152
00:09:25,006 --> 00:09:26,367
Nine weeks.

153
00:09:26,883 --> 00:09:28,369
Doesn't change anything.

154
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:30,872
She shot him in the back
while he lay sleeping.

155
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:32,540
That's all the jury's gonna hear.

156
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:34,709
You ever heard of
"battered woman syndrome"?

157
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:36,377
They have a syndrome now?

158
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:39,865
My older sister was
married to a gym teacher.

159
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:42,216
Ran the youth ministry at church.

160
00:09:42,218 --> 00:09:43,785
Chaired the big school carnival

161
00:09:43,787 --> 00:09:46,054
to raise money for cancer research.

162
00:09:46,056 --> 00:09:47,555
And when they'd fight...

163
00:09:47,557 --> 00:09:50,692
which apparently was more
than anybody realized...

164
00:09:50,694 --> 00:09:53,828
he'd get her on the
ground and... kick her.

165
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:55,963
He weighed 215.

166
00:09:55,965 --> 00:09:57,598
She weighed 122.

167
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,568
And one day, he kicked her too hard.

168
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:02,737
Ruptured her spleen.

169
00:10:04,254 --> 00:10:06,874
And six hours later, she was gone.

170
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,676
I'm sorry.

171
00:10:08,678 --> 00:10:11,412
But I know that you know that
has nothing to do with this.

172
00:10:11,414 --> 00:10:13,348
I'm telling you, I have this handled.

173
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,216
I've been huddling with the A.D.A.

174
00:10:15,218 --> 00:10:16,818
They're gonna try her
for first-degree murder...

175
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,753
Is that your applause line?

176
00:10:18,755 --> 00:10:21,756
Reducible to second degree
manslaughter, which means

177
00:10:21,758 --> 00:10:24,399
that all we have to do
is create some kind of doubt,

178
00:10:24,401 --> 00:10:26,961
and then we've got a 90% chance
that the jury's gonna convict

179
00:10:26,963 --> 00:10:28,262
on the lesser plea, and she's looking

180
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:29,630
at seven to eight years instead of life.

181
00:10:29,632 --> 00:10:31,733
You've given up on her already.

182
00:10:31,735 --> 00:10:34,602
Her being found innocent
isn't even on your menu.

183
00:10:34,604 --> 00:10:36,704
She isn't innocent.
She shot him in the back

184
00:10:36,706 --> 00:10:38,039
while he was sleeping.

185
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,240
Have you spoken with her?

186
00:10:39,242 --> 00:10:40,808
Have you conferred with your client?

187
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,410
No. She's been sedated, but what is it

188
00:10:42,412 --> 00:10:43,644
that you think she would say?

189
00:10:44,586 --> 00:10:46,047
You're fired.

190
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:47,422
Excuse me?

191
00:10:48,423 --> 00:10:50,318
Okay. Two things.

192
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,853
I didn't ask for this job,

193
00:10:51,855 --> 00:10:53,254
You're not the one who hired me.

194
00:10:53,845 --> 00:10:56,290
Trust me. By the time you get downstairs,

195
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:58,459
I'll make sure you're fired,

196
00:10:58,461 --> 00:11:00,836
unless you go to the judge and you demand

197
00:11:00,838 --> 00:11:03,678
that she be tried on first-
degree murder charges,

198
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,696
only first-degree.

199
00:11:06,095 --> 00:11:07,702
It's all or nothing.

200
00:11:08,188 --> 00:11:09,470
You're out of your mind.

201
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:12,006
And you're out of your depth.

202
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:13,794
And you're fired.

203
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:16,676
Fine by me.

204
00:11:17,353 --> 00:11:19,320
I'm sure it is.

205
00:11:24,693 --> 00:11:26,893
Benjamin Colón.

206
00:11:26,961 --> 00:11:28,890
It's time to go to work.

207
00:11:41,187 --> 00:11:44,214
This happy couple is
Kate and Brian Martin.

208
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:46,497
He was a writing professor
at Hudson College.

209
00:11:46,499 --> 00:11:49,242
She had her master's and was
working on her first novel.

210
00:11:49,244 --> 00:11:51,863
In addition to being a serial adulterer,

211
00:11:51,865 --> 00:11:55,269
Kate claims he physically
and psychologically abused her

212
00:11:55,294 --> 00:11:57,394
for at least the past three years.

213
00:11:57,867 --> 00:11:59,997
Last week, while eight weeks pregnant

214
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:03,968
with their first child, she shot
him in the back while he slept.

215
00:12:05,204 --> 00:12:08,305
Then she went to sleep
while he bled out next to her.

216
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:09,406
God.

217
00:12:09,408 --> 00:12:10,741
Sounds horrible.

218
00:12:10,743 --> 00:12:13,210
- I gather she's our client?
- Yes, she is.

219
00:12:13,212 --> 00:12:14,779
And it is horrible.

220
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:17,047
It's also daunting from
a legal perspective.

221
00:12:17,049 --> 00:12:19,884
I mean, how do you prove
that shooting someone

222
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:22,453
while they slept is,
in fact, self-defense?

223
00:12:22,851 --> 00:12:24,789
Between you and me,
I don't think you can.

224
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:28,359
Your opinion notwithstanding,
Bull believes she's innocent.

225
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:30,094
In fact, he believes it so strongly

226
00:12:30,096 --> 00:12:32,997
that he and I argued in
front of a judge yesterday

227
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:36,000
that the only charge that
the jury should consider

228
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:37,835
is first-degree murder.

229
00:12:37,837 --> 00:12:39,804
No lesser charges,

230
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:42,473
no manslaughter, no assault
with a deadly weapon...

231
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:44,074
it's all or nothing.

232
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:47,344
Life in prison or no jail time at all.

233
00:12:47,346 --> 00:12:49,880
Right now there is precious
little evidence to offer

234
00:12:49,882 --> 00:12:52,183
with regard to Brian's
propensity for violence.

235
00:12:52,185 --> 00:12:54,819
Kate didn't talk about it with anyone.

236
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:57,421
So I need the two of you to drill down

237
00:12:57,423 --> 00:12:59,223
on Brian's romantic life

238
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:00,791
and find some other victims...

239
00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:03,861
victims willing to testify
on Kate's behalf.

240
00:13:03,863 --> 00:13:06,664
Finding exes online? That's my area.

241
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,438
Can I ask a highly
inappropriate question?

242
00:13:09,502 --> 00:13:11,691
How much of this has to do
with Bull's sister?

243
00:13:13,234 --> 00:13:15,873
How did you know about Bull's sister?

244
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,441
I came here from the FBI.

245
00:13:17,443 --> 00:13:19,076
I wasn't about to change jobs

246
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:21,712
without knowing everything
I could about my employer.

247
00:13:21,714 --> 00:13:23,147
Wait a minute.

248
00:13:23,912 --> 00:13:25,950
What do you guys know that I don't know?

249
00:13:25,952 --> 00:13:29,086
I got to go. I'm meeting Bull.

250
00:13:29,088 --> 00:13:31,347
And I have a jury pool list

251
00:13:31,349 --> 00:13:33,991
I need to pick up from the county clerk.

252
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:36,261
Danny?

253
00:13:37,063 --> 00:13:39,230
You have a keyboard. Use it.

254
00:13:39,966 --> 00:13:41,765
Professor Jameson.

255
00:13:42,635 --> 00:13:44,902
Professor Jameson.

256
00:13:45,705 --> 00:13:47,269
You failed me.

257
00:13:47,271 --> 00:13:48,906
I did nothing of the kind, Mr. Palmer.

258
00:13:48,908 --> 00:13:51,308
You failed yourself. All I did was record

259
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,944
and aggregate an average
of your grades in my class.

260
00:13:53,946 --> 00:13:55,212
Grades that you gave me.

261
00:13:55,214 --> 00:13:56,947
Grades that I'm convinced
reflect your biases

262
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:58,983
far more than they reflect my work.

263
00:13:58,985 --> 00:14:00,885
You're entitled to your
opinion, Mr. Palmer.

264
00:14:00,887 --> 00:14:01,986
It's not my opinion.

265
00:14:01,988 --> 00:14:04,021
I got A's in my other two courses.

266
00:14:04,023 --> 00:14:06,323
Well, I can't speak
to your work in other courses,

267
00:14:06,325 --> 00:14:08,092
but in mine, your work was deficient,

268
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:09,651
and your grade reflects that.

269
00:14:09,653 --> 00:14:11,262
And by the way, I don't take kindly

270
00:14:11,264 --> 00:14:13,063
to being shanghaied in the hallway.

271
00:14:13,065 --> 00:14:15,332
Well, I tried for a week to get
an appointment with your office,

272
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:16,467
but no one returned my calls.

273
00:14:16,469 --> 00:14:18,569
I can't imagine why.

274
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:21,338
Is it just that I work
for a trial scientist?

275
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,107
Or is there more?

276
00:14:23,109 --> 00:14:24,308
What does it matter?

277
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,110
I'll almost certainly
never see you again,

278
00:14:26,112 --> 00:14:27,945
and you'll almost certainly never see me.

279
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:30,414
I prefer to focus on the positive.

280
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:33,651
I prefer to focus on that.

281
00:14:33,653 --> 00:14:35,853
Good day, Mr. Palmer.

282
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:39,323
She told me she left once before.

283
00:14:39,325 --> 00:14:40,524
Headed down to Florida.

284
00:14:40,526 --> 00:14:43,027
Within a week, he found her,
begged her to return,

285
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:45,462
said that it would be different,
that he had changed.

286
00:14:45,464 --> 00:14:48,799
Apparently, on their whole
car trip back to New York,

287
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:51,508
he was wonderful...
funny, charming, loving.

288
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,103
And then as soon as they got back

289
00:14:53,105 --> 00:14:55,539
in the apartment,
he broke her collarbone.

290
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,975
Boy, I'd love to get somebody
to testify to that...

291
00:14:57,977 --> 00:14:59,610
a doctor or insurance adjustor...

292
00:14:59,612 --> 00:15:01,211
They don't exist.

293
00:15:01,213 --> 00:15:03,380
He covered his tracks very well.

294
00:15:03,382 --> 00:15:06,317
And because she loved him, she helped.

295
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:09,386
And having fled once, she realized...

296
00:15:09,388 --> 00:15:11,388
running wouldn't solve anything.

297
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,524
That no matter where she went,

298
00:15:13,526 --> 00:15:16,126
he'd find her and keep hurting her,

299
00:15:16,128 --> 00:15:18,529
and, by extension, hurt the baby.

300
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:20,097
So...

301
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:22,199
no witnesses, no hospital records.

302
00:15:22,201 --> 00:15:24,368
How do we get the jury to understand

303
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,703
what her life was like?

304
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:28,105
For that matter, what kind
of jurors are we looking for?

305
00:15:28,107 --> 00:15:29,707
It's actually easier for me to tell you

306
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:31,275
who we're not looking for.

307
00:15:31,277 --> 00:15:34,345
We're not looking for people
who are rigid and rule-bound.

308
00:15:34,347 --> 00:15:35,713
They're just gonna follow the law

309
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:37,982
and send our lady to prison for life.

310
00:15:37,984 --> 00:15:40,818
Forgive me, but how do you
find something like that out?

311
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,587
How do you see if a person
is rigid or rule-bound?

312
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:45,756
It's all about the questions.

313
00:15:45,758 --> 00:15:48,592
It's Christmas morning, and your
kids are opening up presents.

314
00:15:48,594 --> 00:15:50,794
Lots of toys to put together.

315
00:15:50,796 --> 00:15:53,564
Anybody here actually look
at the instructions?

316
00:15:55,501 --> 00:15:58,469
Your Honor, we'd like to thank
and excuse this juror.

317
00:15:58,471 --> 00:16:00,437
Once we weed out the rule-bound,

318
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:04,130
we need to identify folks
with strong survival instincts,

319
00:16:04,132 --> 00:16:05,843
people who listen to their intuition

320
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:08,245
when it comes to dangerous situations

321
00:16:08,247 --> 00:16:11,081
and act on it without fear
of the consequences.

322
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,550
You're on the street,
and you see an older man

323
00:16:13,552 --> 00:16:16,120
with a child who seems
frightened and is pulling away.

324
00:16:16,122 --> 00:16:17,321
What do you do?

325
00:16:17,323 --> 00:16:18,689
What do you mean?

326
00:16:18,691 --> 00:16:20,791
How do you know
it's not the kid's father?

327
00:16:20,793 --> 00:16:22,292
Maybe the kid's being difficult?

328
00:16:22,294 --> 00:16:24,361
I'm not sure there's anything to do.

329
00:16:24,363 --> 00:16:26,663
Your Honor, we move to strike this juror.

330
00:16:26,665 --> 00:16:28,699
We're looking for people who,

331
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:31,502
when confronted with a
potentially dangerous situation,

332
00:16:31,504 --> 00:16:34,238
don't hesitate, don't ask
if it's the right move...

333
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,007
they just act, like Kate did.

334
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:38,675
And you, sir, what do you do?

335
00:16:38,677 --> 00:16:40,744
If I'm reading it
as a dangerous situation,

336
00:16:40,746 --> 00:16:42,679
maybe I pretend to be the kid's dad.

337
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:45,949
Get him away from the guy
so I can find the real parents.

338
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:49,242
This juror's acceptable to
the defense, Your Honor.

339
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:56,493
Nice to see you again, Kate.

340
00:16:56,495 --> 00:16:57,861
You're looking better.

341
00:16:57,863 --> 00:17:00,330
I'm guessing they're
weaning you off the sedatives?

342
00:17:00,878 --> 00:17:02,833
I was never on a lot to begin with

343
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:04,401
because of the baby.

344
00:17:05,905 --> 00:17:08,238
Kate, remember...

345
00:17:08,845 --> 00:17:10,638
you did what you had to do.

346
00:17:12,056 --> 00:17:13,811
You can't let go of that.

347
00:17:22,488 --> 00:17:24,455
A.D.A. Lake.

348
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:26,723
Dr. Bull.

349
00:17:26,725 --> 00:17:29,893
I have been staring at you
from across the courtroom,

350
00:17:29,895 --> 00:17:32,167
and last night I finally got the chance

351
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:34,765
to do a little homework and
find out something about you.

352
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:36,467
A.D.A. Lake,

353
00:17:36,469 --> 00:17:38,836
you've been assigned
to the Domestic Violence unit

354
00:17:38,838 --> 00:17:40,704
for the past 15 years.

355
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:43,974
You've made a career
out of putting abusers away,

356
00:17:43,976 --> 00:17:46,110
protecting people like my client.

357
00:17:46,112 --> 00:17:47,811
What's wrong with this picture?

358
00:17:47,813 --> 00:17:50,614
Nothing's wrong with
this picture, Dr. Bull.

359
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:53,317
Sometimes it's harder
than you might think

360
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:55,600
to tell the abused from the abuser.

361
00:18:03,696 --> 00:18:05,376
Sometimes it's harder
than you might think.

362
00:18:17,303 --> 00:18:18,836
My God.

363
00:18:18,838 --> 00:18:20,404
His whole family is here.

364
00:18:20,406 --> 00:18:21,839
Maybe I made a mistake.

365
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:24,408
Maybe I should have let
you call my family.

366
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,504
It's okay.

367
00:18:26,813 --> 00:18:29,113
We'll make some calls after court.

368
00:18:32,485 --> 00:18:34,084
It's been said

369
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:37,421
that every marriage
is its own secret society,

370
00:18:37,423 --> 00:18:40,925
with its own rules and customs
and understandings.

371
00:18:40,927 --> 00:18:43,572
Was abuse part of the Martin marriage?

372
00:18:43,574 --> 00:18:45,830
Yes, it was...

373
00:18:45,832 --> 00:18:47,865
on both sides.

374
00:18:47,867 --> 00:18:49,934
That's not what happened at all.

375
00:18:49,936 --> 00:18:51,869
Were there infidelities?

376
00:18:51,871 --> 00:18:55,342
Yes, as we will prove, on both sides.

377
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:58,843
That woman certainly can
spin a yarn, can't she?

378
00:18:58,845 --> 00:19:00,811
Officer Levy,

379
00:19:00,813 --> 00:19:02,947
can you please tell us about your visit

380
00:19:02,949 --> 00:19:05,115
to the Martins' home some two years ago

381
00:19:05,117 --> 00:19:06,684
on April 8, 2016?

382
00:19:06,686 --> 00:19:09,119
A noise complaint
was called into the station.

383
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:10,554
I responded.

384
00:19:10,556 --> 00:19:11,956
And what did you find?

385
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,492
I arrived on scene, where
the defendant and her husband

386
00:19:14,494 --> 00:19:16,026
had clearly been fighting.

387
00:19:16,028 --> 00:19:18,829
Broken pictures,
knickknacks on the floor,

388
00:19:18,831 --> 00:19:21,232
laptop computer looked like it'd
been thrown against the wall.

389
00:19:21,234 --> 00:19:24,635
They had apparently calmed down
prior to my arrival.

390
00:19:24,637 --> 00:19:27,204
And both assured me everything was okay.

391
00:19:27,206 --> 00:19:30,307
While I didn't see any evidence
of physical abuse,

392
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:33,711
I followed protocol, separated
the defendant and her husband,

393
00:19:33,713 --> 00:19:36,380
urged Mrs. Martin
to speak candidly to me.

394
00:19:36,382 --> 00:19:39,450
It's a tiny apartment...
Brian could hear everything.

395
00:19:39,452 --> 00:19:41,151
And what did she say?

396
00:19:41,153 --> 00:19:42,553
She appeared calm.

397
00:19:42,555 --> 00:19:44,488
Said it was a misunderstanding.

398
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,390
And what happened the next day?

399
00:19:46,392 --> 00:19:49,059
Mr. Martin reached out to me
at the station.

400
00:19:49,061 --> 00:19:51,428
He was interested in filing
a restraining order

401
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,597
against Mrs. Martin.

402
00:19:56,002 --> 00:19:57,897
I thought it couldn't get any worse,

403
00:19:57,899 --> 00:20:00,004
but it actually has.

404
00:20:00,973 --> 00:20:03,361
What restraining order
is he talking about?

405
00:20:03,363 --> 00:20:04,708
I-I have no idea.

406
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,910
Danny here.

407
00:20:05,912 --> 00:20:08,178
Look, no restraining order
was ever actually issued.

408
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,382
And no official report was filed
with the station house.

409
00:20:11,384 --> 00:20:13,484
So are you saying

410
00:20:13,486 --> 00:20:15,486
that the victim was afraid of his wife,

411
00:20:15,488 --> 00:20:17,555
that he felt the need to protect himself?

412
00:20:17,557 --> 00:20:18,789
Objection, Your Honor.

413
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:21,191
There is no restraining order,

414
00:20:21,193 --> 00:20:22,993
not that we've been able to determine,

415
00:20:22,995 --> 00:20:26,363
and not that the prosecution
offered in discovery.

416
00:20:26,365 --> 00:20:27,498
Can I answer?

417
00:20:27,918 --> 00:20:29,433
Go ahead.

418
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:31,769
I never said Mr. Martin
actually filed the order.

419
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,405
I only said that he inquired
about the process.

420
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:36,640
I'm sorry if I wasn't clear about that.

421
00:20:36,642 --> 00:20:38,175
Bearer of bad news here.

422
00:20:38,177 --> 00:20:39,877
The jurors find Officer Levy credible,

423
00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:41,645
and they're buying into the idea

424
00:20:41,647 --> 00:20:43,881
that Brian could have
been afraid of Kate.

425
00:20:43,883 --> 00:20:46,383
It's all feeding into
the prosecution's story.

426
00:20:46,385 --> 00:20:48,385
Officer Levy,

427
00:20:48,387 --> 00:20:50,721
isn't it true that
sometimes people seek out

428
00:20:50,723 --> 00:20:53,624
restraining orders for
duplicitous reasons?

429
00:20:54,236 --> 00:20:57,356
People can and do abuse the system, sure.

430
00:20:57,358 --> 00:21:00,798
And isn't it true that
sometimes abusive partners

431
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,501
will go through the motions of
taking out a restraining order

432
00:21:04,503 --> 00:21:08,706
against their victims to...
create a false narrative

433
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,608
or to neutralize a situation

434
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,814
should they ever be taken to court?

435
00:21:11,816 --> 00:21:12,943
Objection.

436
00:21:12,945 --> 00:21:14,712
That is not a question.

437
00:21:14,714 --> 00:21:16,313
Jury heard it, though.

438
00:21:16,315 --> 00:21:18,315
Ask a question, Mr. Colón.

439
00:21:18,317 --> 00:21:22,820
Are restraining orders ever
sought as a preemptive defense?

440
00:21:22,822 --> 00:21:25,289
So, in case the abuser

441
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,790
ever got caught, they could point

442
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:29,994
to the order and say that
they were defending themselves.

443
00:21:29,996 --> 00:21:31,562
Sure.

444
00:21:31,982 --> 00:21:33,764
I've heard of that happening.

445
00:21:33,766 --> 00:21:35,010
Not a lot, but...

446
00:21:35,012 --> 00:21:36,696
But you are aware of it, aren't you?

447
00:21:38,337 --> 00:21:39,863
I am.

448
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:41,330
Thank you, Officer Levy.

449
00:21:41,332 --> 00:21:42,931
No further questions.

450
00:21:45,336 --> 00:21:46,635
Good job, Benny.

451
00:21:46,637 --> 00:21:48,437
We finally picked up a juror.

452
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:51,273
One down, 11 to go.

453
00:21:55,179 --> 00:21:59,315
A girl's first day in court...
a memory I'll always cherish.

454
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:02,084
And by the way, I was never unfaithful

455
00:22:02,086 --> 00:22:05,521
to my husband, and I never struck him.

456
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,391
It's easy to get discouraged.

457
00:22:09,393 --> 00:22:12,628
Just remember,
nobody's heard our side yet.

458
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,963
Okay?

459
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:25,619
So, you and Izzy connect yet?

460
00:22:26,944 --> 00:22:30,446
Nope. I left her three messages.

461
00:22:30,448 --> 00:22:33,682
I guess whatever the
reason for her call was,

462
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:36,785
she decided it wasn't
so important after all.

463
00:22:36,787 --> 00:22:39,521
Well, no matter what, I'm your guy.

464
00:22:40,718 --> 00:22:42,091
Okay.

465
00:22:42,093 --> 00:22:44,793
I don't remember asking
for a loyalty oath,

466
00:22:44,795 --> 00:22:47,496
but I appreciate the gesture.

467
00:22:47,498 --> 00:22:49,431
You know...

468
00:22:49,433 --> 00:22:52,034
I've never felt less prepared
to do my job

469
00:22:52,036 --> 00:22:53,902
than I did today.

470
00:22:53,904 --> 00:22:56,238
We know precious little about this woman.

471
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,740
Now wait a second.

472
00:22:57,742 --> 00:22:59,274
Dr. Grint... Marian...

473
00:22:59,276 --> 00:23:01,009
from the Survivors'
Justice Project, she...

474
00:23:01,011 --> 00:23:03,545
Marian is not a lawyer.
She's not a detective.

475
00:23:03,547 --> 00:23:07,149
She is a doctor of social work.

476
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:09,418
She knows what Kate tells her.

477
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,854
I know you trust her.

478
00:23:11,856 --> 00:23:15,002
I know she did everything
she could to help your sister.

479
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:17,559
I don't know.

480
00:23:17,561 --> 00:23:20,396
Two and a half years
and all these supposed beatings,

481
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:23,832
not a-a single doctor to testify for us?

482
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:26,368
Not a single hospital bill?
Not a single friend?

483
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,637
Everybody's working. Everybody's trying.

484
00:23:28,639 --> 00:23:30,639
I know. I know.

485
00:23:30,641 --> 00:23:34,021
Like I said, I'm your guy.

486
00:23:34,512 --> 00:23:36,245
But I need you to know

487
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:39,014
that I don't have a lot to work with.

488
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:41,750
And I just don't want to let you down.

489
00:23:53,529 --> 00:23:54,961
I just went through the witness statement

490
00:23:54,963 --> 00:23:57,211
for Alyssa Bell, Brian's
current teaching assistant

491
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:59,669
and the woman he was having an
affair with when Kate shot him.

492
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:02,505
According to her, he wasn't violent,

493
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:05,108
he never struck her, barely
even raised his voice.

494
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,443
Not to pile on,

495
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,345
but I've gone through
all of his social media

496
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:09,679
and even hacked his e-mail.

497
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,147
The guy was clearly a dog.

498
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:13,383
I mean, every semester,
he would get a new T.A.,

499
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:16,953
and by "get," I'm pretty sure
you guys know what I mean.

500
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:20,826
But I guess I'd be lying
if I said there was even a hint

501
00:24:20,828 --> 00:24:22,235
that anyone was afraid of him

502
00:24:22,237 --> 00:24:24,561
or concerned for their physical safety.

503
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:27,230
I was able to get a set of medical files

504
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,499
from the walk-in clinic
that she told us she went to

505
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,501
in the fall for her collarbone injury.

506
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:34,337
The problem is, is the
patient name she used

507
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:36,406
when she checked in is Jane Doe,

508
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:39,976
and the doctor who attended
to her no longer works there.

509
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,749
Any other discouraging news
on the investigative front?

510
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,020
Excellent.

511
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:51,821
We need to talk strategy for tomorrow.

512
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,991
The A.D.A. is gonna call
Brian's sister to the stand.

513
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,327
- Surprise, surprise.
- We need to get ahead of it.

514
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,130
Counteract what we know
is gonna be emotional testimony

515
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:02,866
without making it look like
we are attacking a woman

516
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:04,167
who just lost her brother.

517
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,304
You think she knew about Brian's abuse?

518
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:09,639
Judging from the way she
and everyone else in her family

519
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,508
are glaring at Kate...

520
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,643
I don't think she had a clue.

521
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:15,145
Can't we use that in our favor?

522
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:16,546
How do you mean?

523
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,014
She's just like the jurors.

524
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,050
In her mind, there's no abuse.

525
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:23,320
There's no possible
justification for what Kate did.

526
00:25:23,714 --> 00:25:25,422
But if we can educate her,

527
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:27,657
show her while she's on the stand

528
00:25:28,052 --> 00:25:29,993
what she didn't know about her brother,

529
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:31,961
make her see the truth,

530
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:34,097
the jurors are gonna see it, too.

531
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,699
That's a nice plan, Chunk.

532
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,701
Unfortunately, we have no evidence

533
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,703
to support any of Kate's assertions.

534
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,272
Can't just say things to the woman

535
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:43,940
without being able to back them up.

536
00:25:45,486 --> 00:25:47,610
Well, I'll get to work
on this list of exes.

537
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,546
Yeah, I'll keep hacking away.

538
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,715
Maybe one of the T.A.s texted a friend

539
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,286
or their mother... something we can use.

540
00:26:07,591 --> 00:26:09,332
You gonna be okay?

541
00:26:09,843 --> 00:26:11,534
No.

542
00:26:13,378 --> 00:26:15,878
They're all correct, you know.

543
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,076
I've done a stupid thing.

544
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,731
Relied on a faulty piece of calculus.

545
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:25,882
Helping this woman
will not change the fact

546
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:29,586
that I did nothing to help my own sister.

547
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:33,056
It's true. You failed at being God.

548
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:35,892
You are responsible
for everyone and everything.

549
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:36,993
Just indulge me.

550
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:39,028
Let me wallow in my own self pity.

551
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,463
You know what, Jason?

552
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,565
Your sister was an adult.

553
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,000
She made her own decisions,

554
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:46,736
her own choices about who to be with.

555
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:49,873
And nothing you could have done
would have changed that.

556
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,408
You loved her.

557
00:26:52,094 --> 00:26:54,110
And that is really your only obligation

558
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,806
as a brother.

559
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:59,082
As for our client,
you can only do what you can do.

560
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:01,885
She's giving you very little
to work with.

561
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,889
Get some sleep.

562
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:07,524
Tomorrow is gonna come

563
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:10,160
whether we're ready for it or not.

564
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:14,264
And as a brilliant trial scientist

565
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:18,201
once said to me,
if anyone tells you they know

566
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:20,703
how a criminal proceeding is gonna end,

567
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:22,772
they've never been to more than one.

568
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,176
See you in the morning.

569
00:27:30,632 --> 00:27:32,816
My brother had a really good heart.

570
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:34,250
He loved his wife.

571
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:36,352
He always spoke so highly of her.

572
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:39,823
It was like he was
constantly selling her to us.

573
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,591
I was like, "We already bought her."

574
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,126
We love her."

575
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:44,730
I just...

576
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:50,500
I don't understand.

577
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,037
Objection, Your Honor.

578
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,438
Relevance?

579
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,973
Take your seat, Mr. Colón.

580
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,194
You may continue.

581
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:01,211
What do you mean?

582
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:02,512
What don't you understand?

583
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,980
All of it.

584
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:07,283
How you can say you love a man
and then kill him.

585
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:09,185
Can't say you love him

586
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,840
knowing you watched him
bleed out on your bed.

587
00:28:13,592 --> 00:28:16,226
Now, Kate and Brian

588
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:18,394
were married almost four years.

589
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:19,996
In all that time,

590
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:22,599
how often would you say
you visited their apartment?

591
00:28:23,811 --> 00:28:26,236
Actually, I've never been
to their apartment.

592
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:27,537
Really?

593
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:31,174
I find that surprising.
He was your brother.

594
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:33,042
Well, they lived in Brooklyn.

595
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,311
It's hard to get to from where we are.

596
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,914
But they invited you, right?

597
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,516
Tried to get you over?

598
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:41,684
Actually, I'm not sure that they did.

599
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:43,920
I mean, he was always talking about

600
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:45,421
how small the apartment was,

601
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:48,224
and-and I'm not sure
that they felt comfortable

602
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,459
entertaining there.

603
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:50,627
We had a house.

604
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:53,329
But they visited you. Am I correct?

605
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:55,131
All the time.

606
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,433
Brian loves...

607
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:00,347
loved my daughters, his nieces.

608
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,773
He and Kate
would play with them for hours.

609
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,608
I always thought when the time was right,

610
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,511
they would have
a beautiful family of their own.

611
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:09,935
She really had no idea.

612
00:29:09,937 --> 00:29:11,179
No.

613
00:29:11,181 --> 00:29:14,150
What about vacations?
Did you all vacation together?

614
00:29:14,611 --> 00:29:17,487
We'd try, but Brian's schedule
was so unpredictable.

615
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:19,289
Something was always coming up.

616
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:22,892
What about the Hawaii vacation
last summer?

617
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:27,864
They had to cancel.
Um, something at the university.

618
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:30,099
What if I told you Brian canceled

619
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,670
because he didn't want anyone
seeing Kate in a bathing suit

620
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:36,806
with all her various bruises
and injuries on display?

621
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,875
Objection. No foundation.

622
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,977
Your Honor, I have a good faith basis

623
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,639
for asking the question.

624
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:46,849
Answer the question, please.

625
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:48,918
Well, that's just not true.

626
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,087
I-I don't, I don't understand
what you're saying.

627
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:54,657
He-he had a meeting come up,
a lecture, something.

628
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:58,528
What about the hiking trip last fall?

629
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,798
What if I told you that Brian
fractured Kate's clavicle

630
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,333
just two days before the trip?

631
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:05,301
Objection. Facts not in evidence.

632
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,070
Your Honor, I'd like to submit

633
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:11,641
the following Chelsea West
Walk-In Clinic records

634
00:30:12,169 --> 00:30:13,910
under the name Jane Doe,

635
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:17,614
which our client was just able
to provide us with this morning.

636
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:20,950
I've got medical records, X-rays.

637
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,685
May I please show the witness?

638
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:25,855
I'll allow it,
subject to future verification.

639
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,464
Well, that's fine. I...

640
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:36,766
But I don't know
what I'm looking at here.

641
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,534
It's what your brother did to his wife.

642
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:41,771
Objection. No one has
authenticated those images.

643
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,607
My apologies, Your Honor.
I'm getting ahead of myself.

644
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:48,478
Now, let's just talk about...
the long sleeves in the summer.

645
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,913
The fact that you never
met Kate's family.

646
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:52,849
The fact that Kate never spoke

647
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,151
for herself when Brian was there...

648
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:56,363
and he was always there.

649
00:30:56,365 --> 00:30:59,925
Perhaps 'cause he was afraid
of what she might say.

650
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:02,425
What she'd tell you.

651
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,661
What she'd show you.

652
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:05,995
Objection, Your Honor.

653
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:09,265
They were a beautiful couple.
He adored her.

654
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,300
Your Honor, those are not questions.

655
00:31:11,895 --> 00:31:14,804
Counselor, ask the witness a question

656
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:16,673
and give her a chance to answer.

657
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:19,442
Actually, I have no
further questions, Your Honor.

658
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:22,912
Wow, Bull. You and Benny
just doubled our green jurors.

659
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:25,314
Meaning we have two jurors out of 12.

660
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,517
We're like a runaway train.

661
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,085
So, in all your time together,

662
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:31,081
you never saw a propensity to violence?

663
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:35,658
He never lost his temper?
Um, never made you feel afraid?

664
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:39,729
Okay. Well, um, I appreciate

665
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,731
you taking the time to speak with me.

666
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,534
Enjoy your new home. Enjoy Florida.

667
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:47,670
I found one more, and she's local.

668
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,138
Hailee Sparks.

669
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,641
She dropped out of the grad
program a couple years ago,

670
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:53,276
transferred to a different school.

671
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,244
Cross your fingers.

672
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,480
Maybe he scared her away.

673
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,317
We made some progress today.

674
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,196
I know. I felt it.

675
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:06,366
What's our next move?

676
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,258
You're our next move.

677
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,162
It's time for us to tell our story,

678
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,598
and we have no one to tell it but you.

679
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,067
But isn't that a risky thing to do?

680
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,836
I've always read that you try

681
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:22,371
to never put an accused murderer
on the stand.

682
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:23,372
That's true.

683
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:25,108
But we really have no choice.

684
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,442
My best guess is

685
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,344
we have two jurors on our side.

686
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:30,680
If no one in the jury room

687
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:33,393
is able to-to sway them
during deliberations...

688
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:37,520
best case is you're looking
at a hung jury and a mistrial.

689
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:39,822
With ten jurors ready to convict,

690
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:41,691
the district attorney's office is

691
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,926
definitely going to move to retry,

692
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:47,530
which means you spend a year
in prison... pregnant...

693
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,899
having watched your baby

694
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:52,335
taken from you and put into foster care.

695
00:32:55,582 --> 00:32:57,540
You testifying is the best chance we have

696
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:58,835
to change some minds.

697
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:01,546
I think we have to take it.

698
00:33:11,849 --> 00:33:14,150
Did you know your husband Brian
was having an affair?

699
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,253
I assumed he was having an affair.

700
00:33:17,979 --> 00:33:20,432
I realized shortly after
our first anniversary

701
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:23,291
that he was always having affairs.

702
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,493
Affairs were his oxygen.

703
00:33:25,495 --> 00:33:28,363
I think they made him feel better

704
00:33:28,365 --> 00:33:30,298
about just being
the most popular professor,

705
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,133
instead of the acclaimed novelist,

706
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,202
which is really
what he always wanted to be.

707
00:33:34,204 --> 00:33:36,771
In her opening statement,
the A.D.A. mentioned

708
00:33:36,773 --> 00:33:40,837
that you were also having
extramarital affairs.

709
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:42,035
Is that true?

710
00:33:42,037 --> 00:33:45,586
Not only have I never
cheated on my husband,

711
00:33:45,587 --> 00:33:48,956
my husband is actually the
only man I've ever been with.

712
00:33:49,344 --> 00:33:53,660
I met him when I was 19,
and I was instantly besotted.

713
00:33:54,141 --> 00:33:55,929
I love that word.

714
00:33:55,931 --> 00:33:57,965
Brian taught me that word.

715
00:33:57,967 --> 00:34:00,367
So let me ask you
the million-dollar question.

716
00:34:00,897 --> 00:34:03,503
If you knew your husband
was having an affair,

717
00:34:03,505 --> 00:34:08,041
if he beat you, as you claim,
why not leave?

718
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,490
Because I loved him.

719
00:34:11,313 --> 00:34:14,614
And... maybe I...

720
00:34:14,616 --> 00:34:17,751
I hated me a little bit.

721
00:34:18,206 --> 00:34:21,555
And also, because he'd always
sense when it was too much,

722
00:34:21,557 --> 00:34:23,223
and he'd tell me he was sorry,

723
00:34:23,225 --> 00:34:26,193
that he was putting a stop
to it, and I believed him.

724
00:34:27,196 --> 00:34:28,762
Our ten to two just

725
00:34:28,764 --> 00:34:30,235
became nine to three.

726
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,000
But isn't it true that you tried
to leave once before?

727
00:34:33,662 --> 00:34:36,570
Yes. I left once.

728
00:34:36,572 --> 00:34:39,206
Why? What happened between you

729
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:41,274
that finally made you willing to leave?

730
00:34:41,276 --> 00:34:44,311
He was drunk. He came home.

731
00:34:45,381 --> 00:34:47,277
Told me I was boring.

732
00:34:48,195 --> 00:34:51,685
He told me I was a boring person,

733
00:34:51,687 --> 00:34:53,366
a boring woman,

734
00:34:54,089 --> 00:34:56,161
and most of all...

735
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:59,026
a boring writer.

736
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,396
And that was the straw
that broke the camel's back?

737
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:05,504
No.

738
00:35:06,035 --> 00:35:08,735
He, punched me in the vagina.

739
00:35:09,299 --> 00:35:11,004
Objection.

740
00:35:11,006 --> 00:35:12,939
Your Honor, this woman, this murderer

741
00:35:12,941 --> 00:35:14,808
is telling stories about a dead man

742
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,549
that no one can corroborate.

743
00:35:16,551 --> 00:35:17,978
Sit down, please.

744
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,846
You'll have your chance to cross-examine.

745
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:22,649
Continue, Mr. Colón.

746
00:35:24,064 --> 00:35:25,385
What happened?

747
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,722
Um... he... found me,

748
00:35:28,724 --> 00:35:31,725
drove me home, promised to change.

749
00:35:32,155 --> 00:35:33,727
Broke my collarbone.

750
00:35:34,908 --> 00:35:36,430
Can you tell the jury

751
00:35:36,432 --> 00:35:39,766
what compelled you
to leave this last time?

752
00:35:42,404 --> 00:35:44,604
A hundred things.

753
00:35:44,606 --> 00:35:47,174
A million things.

754
00:35:47,754 --> 00:35:51,745
And then I... I found out that
I was eight weeks pregnant.

755
00:35:53,849 --> 00:35:55,549
No further questions, Your Honor.

756
00:35:55,551 --> 00:35:58,885
I'm staring at eight red and four green.

757
00:36:00,889 --> 00:36:02,622
It's not good enough.

758
00:36:03,603 --> 00:36:05,859
I know you feel I sent
you out there half-naked,

759
00:36:05,861 --> 00:36:08,728
but for what it's worth, you
acquitted yourself beautifully.

760
00:36:10,232 --> 00:36:11,765
She acquitted herself beautifully.

761
00:36:11,767 --> 00:36:13,834
I only wish it were enough.

762
00:36:13,836 --> 00:36:15,368
Yeah, I know what you mean.

763
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,104
If only there were one other person,

764
00:36:17,106 --> 00:36:18,505
someone who would testify

765
00:36:18,507 --> 00:36:20,173
that this guy was genuinely dangerous.

766
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:23,009
Actually, there is.

767
00:36:23,011 --> 00:36:25,946
Two years ago, I T.A.'d his class.

768
00:36:25,948 --> 00:36:29,182
Helped with lectures, small
groups, that sort of thing.

769
00:36:29,184 --> 00:36:33,820
He was charming, flirty...
aggressively so.

770
00:36:33,822 --> 00:36:37,524
I knew he was married,
I knew it was wrong,

771
00:36:37,526 --> 00:36:40,494
but I started sleeping with him anyway.

772
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,129
I told myself

773
00:36:42,131 --> 00:36:43,964
I didn't really have a choice.

774
00:36:43,966 --> 00:36:46,900
He was on the faculty board
in charge of my scholarship,

775
00:36:46,902 --> 00:36:48,568
grading my thesis.

776
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:51,146
It was easier to just go along with it.

777
00:36:52,141 --> 00:36:55,408
I wish I had been smarter, stronger.

778
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,210
Objection. Relevance?

779
00:36:57,212 --> 00:37:00,013
Overruled. Continue, please.

780
00:37:00,015 --> 00:37:03,316
Did you ever have occasion
to meet with Mrs. Martin

781
00:37:03,318 --> 00:37:05,585
during your relationship
with her husband?

782
00:37:05,587 --> 00:37:08,054
I did. Sort of.

783
00:37:08,877 --> 00:37:11,191
There was this one night. It was winter.

784
00:37:11,193 --> 00:37:14,094
I went back to the office late,
which I never did.

785
00:37:14,096 --> 00:37:16,129
I had left my laptop there.

786
00:37:16,718 --> 00:37:18,798
Anyway, there's an outer office

787
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,135
where I worked and an inner
office where Brian worked.

788
00:37:22,137 --> 00:37:26,206
And as I unlocked the front
door, I could hear him in there.

789
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:28,608
And I could hear
a woman's voice, as well.

790
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:31,778
So, anyway, I didn't flip on the light,

791
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,380
didn't do anything.

792
00:37:33,382 --> 00:37:35,236
Just stood there in the doorway.

793
00:37:35,851 --> 00:37:38,823
They were yelling, fighting.

794
00:37:39,688 --> 00:37:43,590
Brian had this tone.
I had never heard it before.

795
00:37:43,592 --> 00:37:46,860
It was... it was so vicious.

796
00:37:46,862 --> 00:37:48,762
He was calling her names,

797
00:37:48,764 --> 00:37:52,879
calling her "stupid,"
calling her his "bitch wife."

798
00:37:53,402 --> 00:37:55,869
And then the woman was crying,

799
00:37:55,871 --> 00:37:58,805
telling him she was going
to go to the police.

800
00:37:58,807 --> 00:38:01,341
And then he laughed, and then...

801
00:38:01,343 --> 00:38:03,348
there was this sound.

802
00:38:03,845 --> 00:38:06,913
I didn't know if he punched her
or if he kicked her,

803
00:38:06,915 --> 00:38:09,316
but you could hear him make contact,

804
00:38:09,318 --> 00:38:10,984
and you could hear her moan.

805
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:12,953
And then I heard him

806
00:38:12,955 --> 00:38:15,956
tell her that if she ever went
to the police, he'd kill her.

807
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:17,557
And what did you do?

808
00:38:18,154 --> 00:38:19,406
God.

809
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:21,991
I did nothing.

810
00:38:22,431 --> 00:38:24,364
I was just kind of frozen.

811
00:38:24,366 --> 00:38:25,999
And then, like, a second later,

812
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:28,335
the inner door office opens,
and it's Brian,

813
00:38:28,337 --> 00:38:29,936
and he sees me standing there,

814
00:38:29,938 --> 00:38:32,639
and I must have just had
this look on my face.

815
00:38:32,641 --> 00:38:34,074
Why? What did he do?

816
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:38,545
He just blew by me, just disappeared,

817
00:38:38,547 --> 00:38:41,114
through the door, down the hall,
just left the building.

818
00:38:41,116 --> 00:38:43,950
And what did you do?

819
00:38:44,681 --> 00:38:48,622
Once I knew he was gone, I called out.

820
00:38:48,624 --> 00:38:51,491
I didn't leave the doorway,
but I called out.

821
00:38:52,147 --> 00:38:54,861
I asked if whoever
was in there was all right,

822
00:38:54,863 --> 00:38:57,364
and she said she was,

823
00:38:57,366 --> 00:38:59,933
so I grabbed my laptop and I left.

824
00:39:00,989 --> 00:39:03,436
Next morning, I withdrew from school.

825
00:39:03,438 --> 00:39:05,639
Never saw Brian again.

826
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:09,175
And I'm so, so sorry.

827
00:39:21,134 --> 00:39:23,089
What you feeling, boss?

828
00:39:23,091 --> 00:39:25,592
Nine days.

829
00:39:25,594 --> 00:39:29,863
We certainly know they thought
about it, struggled with it.

830
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:33,700
That's all we know.

831
00:39:34,314 --> 00:39:35,735
Why did I plead with that judge

832
00:39:35,737 --> 00:39:38,538
to disallow manslaughter
or any other lesser charge?

833
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,174
What possessed me
to go for all or nothing?

834
00:39:41,176 --> 00:39:44,344
I should have left those jurors
a door to walk through.

835
00:39:46,181 --> 00:39:47,664
Okay.

836
00:39:47,666 --> 00:39:50,950
But I think you need to pull
yourself together, Bull.

837
00:39:50,952 --> 00:39:53,333
That girl is depending on you.

838
00:39:54,523 --> 00:39:56,002
I know.

839
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:58,254
I know you know.

840
00:40:00,762 --> 00:40:03,663
Good afternoon, Dr. Bull, Mr. Colón,

841
00:40:03,665 --> 00:40:04,731
Dr. Grint.

842
00:40:07,536 --> 00:40:10,737
I'm sorry. I... I can't stop shaking.

843
00:40:11,351 --> 00:40:13,039
Here.

844
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,565
Hold on to me.

845
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:22,782
That's better, isn't it?

846
00:40:24,399 --> 00:40:26,867
Now you just hang on and
don't let go, 'cause I'm here.

847
00:40:28,785 --> 00:40:30,523
This thing's gonna go one of two ways.

848
00:40:32,594 --> 00:40:34,527
Either it's all been one big bad dream

849
00:40:34,529 --> 00:40:36,329
and you're about to become a free woman,

850
00:40:36,331 --> 00:40:39,833
in which case
I'm gonna take you for a walk,

851
00:40:39,835 --> 00:40:43,466
because walking is very good
for pregnant women, you know.

852
00:40:44,506 --> 00:40:46,344
My sister told me that.

853
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:50,328
Or...

854
00:40:51,891 --> 00:40:56,316
if, for some reason, things
don't... go our way in there...

855
00:40:58,153 --> 00:41:00,620
well, you're not rid of me, 'cause...

856
00:41:01,317 --> 00:41:02,889
we're just gonna appeal
the living daylights

857
00:41:02,891 --> 00:41:04,190
out of this thing.

858
00:41:04,192 --> 00:41:06,593
I mean, you are gonna be so sick of me.

859
00:41:06,595 --> 00:41:08,575
Not possible.

860
00:41:09,331 --> 00:41:11,364
You'll see.

861
00:41:11,366 --> 00:41:13,266
I'm very unusual.

862
00:41:13,268 --> 00:41:15,999
I'm actually an acquired dislike.

863
00:41:32,421 --> 00:41:35,655
We the jury find the defendant,

864
00:41:35,657 --> 00:41:37,562
Kate Martin...

865
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:41,428
not guilty of murder in the first degree.

866
00:41:47,427 --> 00:41:48,970
Thank you for your service.

867
00:41:48,972 --> 00:41:52,005
This court is adjourned.

868
00:42:09,469 --> 00:42:10,723
Good call on

869
00:42:10,725 --> 00:42:12,492
the all-or-nothing strategy.

870
00:42:12,494 --> 00:42:16,162
Hey, when you've been doing this
as long as I have...

871
00:42:18,853 --> 00:42:21,314
And you should reach out to your family.

872
00:42:21,316 --> 00:42:25,572
You're gonna need them,
now more than ever.

873
00:42:34,483 --> 00:42:37,417
It's okay. Let him go.

874
00:42:57,522 --> 00:43:05,522

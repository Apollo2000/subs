168

Sam was taking part in a hazing.

00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:46,870
There was a lot of drinking.

170

And the boys went swimming.

172
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,209
And after Sam drowned,
for whatever reason,

173
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:55,470
they decided not to call it in.

174
00:06:55,472 --> 00:06:57,364
And for the moment,
they have banded together.

175

why wouldn't one of
those boys go and get help?

and I'm part of my neighborhood watch.

487
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,916
MARISSA: Oh, she is

488
00:19:15,918 --> 00:19:17,284
a joiner, Bull.

489
00:19:17,286 --> 00:19:18,986
Also, she belongs to the PTA,

490
00:19:18,988 --> 00:19:20,654
and she's on the board
of her community center.

491
00:19:20,656 --> 00:19:22,189
A pox on her house.

492
00:19:22,191 --> 00:19:23,690
Move to strike, Your Honor.

493
00:19:23,692 --> 00:19:25,592
And what about you, sir?

494
00:19:25,594 --> 00:19:27,194
Do you participate in any organizations?

495
00:19:27,196 --> 00:19:28,762
I belong to the Rotary.

496
00:19:28,764 --> 00:19:30,364
MARISSA: The president
of his local chapter

497
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:32,399
three years in a row.

498
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:34,601
Move to strike, Your Honor.

499
00:19:36,205 --> 00:19:38,338
Sir, it says here

500
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,074
you're an officer on your co-op board.

501
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:43,410
- What's your title?
- Treasurer.

502
00:19:43,412 --> 00:19:45,712
Bull's-eye. Talk about a thankless job.

503
00:19:45,714 --> 00:19:47,014
People must hate him.

504
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:49,216
But he doesn't care,
which means we love him.

505
00:19:49,218 --> 00:19:51,107
Marissa, talk to me.

506
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:52,519
What do you need, Dr. Bull?

507
00:19:52,521 --> 00:19:54,206
Marissa's not there?

508
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,822
Um, she had...

509
00:19:55,824 --> 00:19:57,641
- an emergency.
- (LAUGHING)

510
00:19:57,643 --> 00:19:58,926
Can I help you?

511
00:19:58,928 --> 00:20:00,794
- What kind of emergency?
- JUROR: By the way,

512
00:20:00,796 --> 00:20:02,396
your pen is leaking.

513
00:20:02,398 --> 00:20:03,864
Oh. (CHUCKLES)

514
00:20:03,866 --> 00:20:05,332
You don't say.

515
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:08,767
Never mind. I don't need her.

516
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:11,672
This juror's acceptable
to the prosecution, Your Honor.

517
00:20:16,478 --> 00:20:17,911
That was a very expensive shirt.

518
00:20:17,913 --> 00:20:20,881
That was a very expensive pen.

519
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,051
Anyone feel like tapas?

520
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,375
Gentlemen.

521
00:20:26,855 --> 00:20:29,256
Mr. Assistant District Attorney?

522
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,391
Sorry to interrupt
your lunch break, gentlemen,

523
00:20:31,393 --> 00:20:33,126
but I was hoping to get a word.

524
00:20:33,128 --> 00:20:34,428
What's on your mind, Counselor?

525
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,730
Well, I know you're not
gonna like this, but, uh,

526
00:20:36,732 --> 00:20:39,299
I believe that
what we're looking at here

527
00:20:39,301 --> 00:20:42,202
is a tragic accident.
Nothing more, nothing less.

528
00:20:42,204 --> 00:20:45,672
But to compound the felony
by destroying 15 young lives...

529
00:20:45,674 --> 00:20:47,908
it makes no sense.

530
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,643
There's no physical evidence,
you got no eyewitnesses.

531
00:20:49,645 --> 00:20:50,911
BULL: Wait a second.

532
00:20:50,913 --> 00:20:53,213
None of that changes the fact
that someone died

533
00:20:53,215 --> 00:20:54,648
during the commission of a crime.

534
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,284
Excuse me, Jury Consultant.

535
00:20:58,153 --> 00:20:59,453
What crime?

536
00:20:59,455 --> 00:21:01,221
Contributing to the delinquency
of a minor.

537
00:21:01,223 --> 00:21:03,624
Providing alcohol
to someone who is underage.

538
00:21:03,626 --> 00:21:06,126
And by the way, I'm a trial scientist.

539
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,262
What I do is, I tell lawyers...

540
00:21:08,264 --> 00:21:10,197
the ones who are smart enough
to listen...

541
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:12,933
what to do so they can win their cases.

542
00:21:12,935 --> 00:21:14,868
And they pay me very well for it.

543
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:17,738
I'm guessing you and I are not
destined to work together.

544
00:21:18,386 --> 00:21:20,340
These boys, including the victim,

545
00:21:20,342 --> 00:21:22,242
were doing what college kids
have been doing

546
00:21:22,244 --> 00:21:23,910
for 100 years... drinking.

547
00:21:23,912 --> 00:21:26,413
You really want to send them
to prison for that?

548
00:21:26,415 --> 00:21:28,782
An 18-year-old boy died, Counselor.

549
00:21:28,784 --> 00:21:30,150
And a mother lost her child.

550
00:21:30,152 --> 00:21:31,418
Absolutely.

551
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,247
It's a tragedy, but it's
a tragedy born of an accident.

552
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:37,057
No one set out to murder this poor boy.

553
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:39,026
My clients weren't even present
when it happened.

554
00:21:39,028 --> 00:21:40,627
So they say.

555
00:21:40,908 --> 00:21:42,429
I tell you what.

556
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,499
I'll let 14 of them walk.

557
00:21:45,501 --> 00:21:47,367
Mr. Assistant District Attorney.

558
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:50,751
I will... under one condition.

559
00:21:51,307 --> 00:21:53,974
I want the person responsible.

560
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:57,144
The one who said,
“Let's get these pledges drunk”"

561
00:21:57,633 --> 00:21:59,279
The one who said,
“Let's take them for a swim.”

562
00:21:59,281 --> 00:22:02,683
I want that person to come forward

563
00:22:02,685 --> 00:22:04,618
and accept responsibility.

564
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:08,455
There's no such person,
Mr. Assistant District Attorney.

565
00:22:09,812 --> 00:22:11,558
Enjoy your lunch, gentlemen.

566
00:22:15,164 --> 00:22:16,697
BULL: <i>Well, this is a career first.</i>

567
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:19,266
<i>We're about to start a trial,
and I have no case.</i>

568
00:22:19,268 --> 00:22:21,702
- We have a case.
- No, we don't.

569
00:22:22,158 --> 00:22:24,404
No. My idea didn't work.

570
00:22:24,785 --> 00:22:27,074
I was sure they'd crack
and somebody would come to us

571
00:22:27,076 --> 00:22:30,110
and tell us the truth, but... (SIGHS)

572
00:22:30,112 --> 00:22:33,347
they just offered to let us surrender.

573
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,820
Look at that.

574
00:22:39,822 --> 00:22:41,388
Not one, “I'm sorry.”

575
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,290
Not one, “He was my friend.”

576
00:22:43,292 --> 00:22:45,058
BENNY: They're all terrified,

577
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,927
just not terrified enough
to break ranks.

578
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:48,328
BULL: You know what?

579
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,230
We're doing this backward.

580
00:22:50,232 --> 00:22:51,465
What are you talking about?

581
00:22:51,467 --> 00:22:53,767
I'm tired of waiting for them
to come to us.

582
00:22:53,769 --> 00:22:56,636
Let's pick one kid,
separate him from the pack,

583
00:22:56,638 --> 00:22:58,705
and dismiss the charges against him.

584
00:22:58,707 --> 00:23:00,107
What do you mean? Offer him immunity?

585
00:23:02,111 --> 00:23:04,811
Yeah. That's exactly what I mean.

586
00:23:04,813 --> 00:23:07,180
- We have to be smart about it, though.
- (WATER RUNNING)

587
00:23:07,182 --> 00:23:08,782
We have to pick the right guy.

588
00:23:08,784 --> 00:23:10,751
Not the guy we really think is guilty.

589
00:23:10,753 --> 00:23:12,586
We want to see him punished.

590
00:23:12,588 --> 00:23:15,222
We got to pick a guy we can squeeze,

591
00:23:15,224 --> 00:23:18,925
a guy we can put on the stand
and scare the crap out of.

592
00:23:18,927 --> 00:23:21,228
Make him understand,

593
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,230
once we've immunized him,

594
00:23:23,232 --> 00:23:26,900
if he doesn't cooperate,
he'll be locked up for contempt.

595
00:23:26,902 --> 00:23:30,003
If he lies, he'll be
locked up for perjury.

596
00:23:32,207 --> 00:23:34,107
I know just the guy.

597
00:23:36,369 --> 00:23:39,575
All I'm trying to say is, if
you approach it mathematically,

598
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,460
his roommate Carter
is the most vulnerable.

599
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,961
I don't understand.

600
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,863
What do you mean, “mathematically”?

601
00:23:44,865 --> 00:23:46,865
Well, other than lies of omission,

602
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:48,600
the only lies everybody had tell

603
00:23:48,602 --> 00:23:50,502
were that Sam got out of the water

604
00:23:50,504 --> 00:23:53,238
and went back to the frat house
with them... two lies.

605
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,940
Carter, on the other hand,

606
00:23:54,942 --> 00:23:57,042
had to go a lot further.
He had to say that he and Sam

607
00:23:57,044 --> 00:24:00,645
made it back to the room
together and they went to bed.

608
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,848
And that therefore Sam must have snuck

609
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,617
out of the house after
everybody was asleep,

610
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:07,552
and died alone.

611
00:24:07,554 --> 00:24:09,287
Under a grant of immunity,
he must testify,

612
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:11,790
and if he lies, he is subject
to ten years in prison.

613
00:24:11,792 --> 00:24:14,392
Remember, the point of all this
is to get him to tell us

614
00:24:14,394 --> 00:24:15,527
what really happened that night.

615
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:17,529
You have got to use his testimony

616
00:24:17,531 --> 00:24:19,164
against him like a club,

617
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,799
and beat him with it,

618
00:24:20,801 --> 00:24:23,445
until he tells us what we need to know.

619
00:24:25,614 --> 00:24:28,039
I know what I need to do.

620
00:24:29,785 --> 00:24:32,677
Well, if you know what to do,
then our job here is done.

621
00:24:41,054 --> 00:24:42,320
Marissa.

622
00:24:42,322 --> 00:24:43,716
Uh, did you call me?

623
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,191
When do I get to meet him?

624
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,559
Meet who?

625
00:24:47,561 --> 00:24:49,261
Mr. Irresponsible.

626
00:24:49,263 --> 00:24:50,929
Let's just see if it lasts the weekend

627
00:24:50,931 --> 00:24:52,564
before we plan the wedding.

628
00:24:52,566 --> 00:24:54,533
(CHUCKLES)

629
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,868
You know how important you are to me.

630
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,204
I think so.

631
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:02,207
And you can call me anytime.

632
00:25:02,693 --> 00:25:04,809
Day or night with anything.

633
00:25:04,811 --> 00:25:06,244
That is sweet.

634
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:08,113
I'm fine, Bull.

635
00:25:08,115 --> 00:25:10,549
In fact, I'm better than fine.

636
00:25:11,035 --> 00:25:12,584
I'm happy.

637
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,520
I'm happy you're happy.

638
00:25:16,123 --> 00:25:17,255
Go get some sleep.

639
00:25:22,462 --> 00:25:24,162
RICHMOND: <i>You're here on
a grant of immunity.</i>

640
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,398
Um, yes, sir.

641
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,466
That means, so as long
as you tell the truth,

642
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,337
anything you say here,
we can't use it against you.

643
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,573
That's what my lawyer said.

644
00:25:35,476 --> 00:25:37,208
RICHMOND: You and Sam were roommates.

645
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,559
Would you say you were friends?

646
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:39,665
Well, uh,

647
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:42,387
we just met six weeks ago,

648
00:25:42,389 --> 00:25:44,014
but, yes.

649
00:25:44,016 --> 00:25:45,704
W-We liked each other.

650
00:25:45,706 --> 00:25:46,839
RICHMOND: On this particular night,

651
00:25:46,841 --> 00:25:48,781
there was a pledge party.

652
00:25:49,656 --> 00:25:52,611
I think you told the detective
it was a celebration.

653
00:25:53,827 --> 00:25:56,348
Was there alcohol at the celebration?

654
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:58,117
Yes.

655
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:59,625
Did you drink?

656
00:26:01,168 --> 00:26:02,188
Yes.

657
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:04,356
Even though, here in New York State,

658
00:26:04,358 --> 00:26:05,658
you're under the legal drinking age.

659
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,826
DANIELS: Your Honor.

660
00:26:06,828 --> 00:26:08,294
We're prepared to stipulate

661
00:26:08,296 --> 00:26:09,862
that there was underage drinking

662
00:26:09,864 --> 00:26:11,630
at the celebration.

663
00:26:11,632 --> 00:26:13,165
So stipulated.

664
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,401
Did Sam drink?

665
00:26:15,403 --> 00:26:17,236
Yes, I-I saw him drink.

666
00:26:17,238 --> 00:26:18,804
Any idea how much?

667
00:26:18,806 --> 00:26:21,340
CARTER: I, uh, wasn't keeping track.

668
00:26:21,342 --> 00:26:22,842
(RICHMOND CLEARS THROAT)

669
00:26:22,844 --> 00:26:27,112
Coroner says Sam's blood alcohol
level was .43.

670
00:26:27,114 --> 00:26:28,813
Just to put it in perspective,

671
00:26:28,815 --> 00:26:30,815
symptoms in a typical human being

672
00:26:30,817 --> 00:26:34,186
with a blood alcohol level
between .3 and .4

673
00:26:34,188 --> 00:26:36,355
are complete unconsciousness,

674
00:26:36,357 --> 00:26:39,892
depressed or absent reflexes,
and impairment

675
00:26:39,894 --> 00:26:41,727
of circulation and respiration.

676
00:26:41,729 --> 00:26:43,996
Not to put too fine a point on it,

677
00:26:43,998 --> 00:26:45,731
but death has been known to occur

678
00:26:45,733 --> 00:26:49,802
at a blood alcohol level
of .37 or higher.

679
00:26:49,804 --> 00:26:53,339
And fatality is almost certain
for nearly all individuals

680
00:26:53,341 --> 00:26:55,241
at .45 or higher.

681
00:26:55,243 --> 00:26:56,742
DANIELS: Objection, Your Honor.

682
00:26:57,819 --> 00:26:59,745
Is counsel gonna ask a question?

683
00:26:59,747 --> 00:27:02,848
Sustained. Ask a question,
Mr. Abernathy.

684
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,717
Happy to, Your Honor.

685
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:06,318
So based on these findings,

686
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,622
knowing that your roommate... friend...

687
00:27:09,624 --> 00:27:12,491
was almost certainly at the
very edge of consciousness,

688
00:27:12,493 --> 00:27:14,593
perhaps even death's door,

689
00:27:14,595 --> 00:27:16,376
is it still your testimony

690
00:27:16,378 --> 00:27:18,343
that he got out of the water on his own,

691
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,532
traveled three quarters of a mile back

692
00:27:20,534 --> 00:27:22,167
to the fraternity house in the dark,

693
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:25,404
climbed stairs to the second
floor and went to bed?

694
00:27:27,671 --> 00:27:29,441
Yes, sir.

695
00:27:29,443 --> 00:27:31,677
That is my testimony.

696
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,474
RICHMOND: To the room you shared.

697
00:27:33,476 --> 00:27:34,845
Right beside each other.

698
00:27:35,616 --> 00:27:37,182
Yes, sir.

699
00:27:37,184 --> 00:27:39,141
Did he get undressed?

700
00:27:39,987 --> 00:27:42,421
We were already in our underwear.

701
00:27:42,423 --> 00:27:44,056
Did he brush his teeth?

702
00:27:46,127 --> 00:27:48,961
- I-I don't honestly remember.
- RICHMOND: But you are swearing

703
00:27:48,963 --> 00:27:50,863
under oath that the two of you

704
00:27:50,865 --> 00:27:52,164
returned to your room that night

705
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:53,999
safe and sound, and that anything

706
00:27:54,001 --> 00:27:55,601
that happened to him
happened after that.

707
00:27:56,116 --> 00:27:57,536
Yes, sir.

708
00:28:05,112 --> 00:28:09,148
Son, do you know the
punishment for perjury?

709
00:28:09,671 --> 00:28:11,215
It's ten years.

710
00:28:11,646 --> 00:28:14,180
Ten years in prison
for lying to the court.

711
00:28:14,622 --> 00:28:15,754
I'm not lying.

712
00:28:15,756 --> 00:28:17,856
That's ten years per each lie, actually.

713
00:28:17,858 --> 00:28:19,425
So you'll be, what,

714
00:28:19,427 --> 00:28:21,760
29 when you get out? Or 39 or 49.

715
00:28:21,762 --> 00:28:23,362
DANIELS: Objection, Your Honor.

716
00:28:23,364 --> 00:28:25,464
We understand the concept of lying.

717
00:28:25,466 --> 00:28:28,300
We understand ten years,
and we all know how to count.

718
00:28:28,302 --> 00:28:30,302
I'm not lying.

719
00:28:31,193 --> 00:28:32,671
RICHMOND: What if I told you

720
00:28:32,673 --> 00:28:35,240
that I have security video
that shows 16 of you

721
00:28:35,242 --> 00:28:37,543
leaving the house for the celebration,

722
00:28:37,545 --> 00:28:39,511
but only 15 of you coming back?

723
00:28:40,369 --> 00:28:42,314
Would you be inclined
to change your story?

724
00:28:48,656 --> 00:28:50,656
(EXHALES)

725
00:28:50,658 --> 00:28:52,881
All that drinking...

726
00:28:54,091 --> 00:28:56,176
He needed to use the bathroom.

727
00:28:56,464 --> 00:28:58,464
He went in the side door.

728
00:28:58,466 --> 00:29:00,055
It's closer.

729
00:29:01,181 --> 00:29:02,968
No camera there.

730
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,737
Is that your sworn testimony?

731
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,039
(SIGHS) It is.

732
00:29:11,345 --> 00:29:13,527
Nothing further at this moment,
Your Honor.

733
00:29:14,215 --> 00:29:16,882
DANIELS: Defense has no
questions for this witness,

734
00:29:16,884 --> 00:29:18,751
- Your Honor.
- JUDGE: If counsel

735
00:29:18,753 --> 00:29:20,152
for both sides could approach the bench.

736
00:29:20,154 --> 00:29:21,687
What's Marissa saying?

737
00:29:21,689 --> 00:29:23,355
We created a lot of doubt,

738
00:29:23,357 --> 00:29:25,724
but not a lot of certainty
and people don't convict people

739
00:29:25,726 --> 00:29:27,626
based solely on doubt.

740
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:30,195
RICHMOND: The judge would like
to see us in her chambers.

741
00:29:30,197 --> 00:29:33,499
She's threatening to dismiss the case.

742
00:29:33,501 --> 00:29:35,567
(EXHALES): Ooh.

743
00:29:37,853 --> 00:29:40,166
I've got 14 defendants in my courtroom.

744
00:29:40,606 --> 00:29:43,540
14 defendants, 12 jurors,
20-some parents,

745
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:45,842
enough lawyers to hold a convention.

746
00:29:45,844 --> 00:29:48,796
But not one name on the witness list

747
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:51,048
that promises to provide an iota of fact

748
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,983
that will lead us anywhere different

749
00:29:52,985 --> 00:29:54,943
from where we are right now.

750
00:29:54,945 --> 00:29:56,253
In my opinion, this has been

751
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:58,221
a colossal waste of time and resources.

752
00:29:58,223 --> 00:30:01,168
But, Your Honor,
that boy was obviously lying.

753
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,992
That's a supposition, Your Honor.

754
00:30:02,994 --> 00:30:03,894
JUDGE: One we have neither the time

755
00:30:03,896 --> 00:30:06,463
nor the authority to adjudicate.

756
00:30:06,913 --> 00:30:08,532
That would have been
for the jury to decide.

757
00:30:08,534 --> 00:30:09,800
Would have been?

758
00:30:09,802 --> 00:30:11,501
JUDGE: I'm going to
issue a directed verdict.

759
00:30:11,503 --> 00:30:13,770
Everyone innocent on all counts.

760
00:30:13,772 --> 00:30:15,272
Let the defendants,
the jurors, everyone,

761
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:18,050
- go home.
- BULL: But there's one more witness.

762
00:30:18,052 --> 00:30:20,110
JUDGE: Excuse me?

763
00:30:20,112 --> 00:30:22,312
I'm asking a favor, Your Honor.

764
00:30:23,096 --> 00:30:26,049
Allow us one more witness,

765
00:30:26,051 --> 00:30:29,653
and I believe we can bring this
to some kind of just conclusion.

766
00:30:29,655 --> 00:30:31,488
And who is this mystery witness?

767
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,490
The person for whom I took on this case.

768
00:30:34,024 --> 00:30:34,925
The victim's mother.

769
00:30:34,927 --> 00:30:36,193
DANIELS: Excuse me.

770
00:30:36,195 --> 00:30:38,295
She wasn't there when her son died.

771
00:30:38,297 --> 00:30:40,997
She's not a percipient witness.

772
00:30:42,134 --> 00:30:44,909
We're not here to provide
catharsis, Dr. Bull.

773
00:30:44,911 --> 00:30:46,737
We're here to find the truth
and I fail to see

774
00:30:46,739 --> 00:30:48,372
how this is going to get us there.

775
00:30:48,374 --> 00:30:51,174
That's why I called it a favor,
Your Honor.

776
00:30:51,176 --> 00:30:54,578
You promised me you would
get me the truth.

777
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,380
That's what I'm trying to do.

778
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,117
They don't want to hear from me.

779
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:02,018
They already know
everything I'm gonna say.

780
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,487
Don't be so sure.

781
00:31:03,489 --> 00:31:06,857
You remember what you said
to me the first time we met?

782
00:31:07,349 --> 00:31:10,961
I told you I believed there were
people present when Sam died.

783
00:31:10,963 --> 00:31:12,996
And you said just the thought of that

784
00:31:12,998 --> 00:31:14,631
was like a second death to you.

785
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:17,467
The boys need to hear that.

786
00:31:17,469 --> 00:31:20,470
It just might shake
the truth out of them.

787
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:24,574
(SIGHS)

788
00:31:24,576 --> 00:31:26,810
Okay.

789
00:31:29,448 --> 00:31:31,615
Tell me what to say.

790
00:31:32,249 --> 00:31:33,717
Uh, Sam was an only child.

791
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:35,218
He had no father.

792
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,222
He had no brothers, so, the idea

793
00:31:39,224 --> 00:31:41,291
of being in a fraternity...

794
00:31:41,293 --> 00:31:43,360
a house full of brothers and fathers...

795
00:31:43,362 --> 00:31:44,861
he was very excited.

796
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:46,029
DANIELS: Objection.

797
00:31:46,869 --> 00:31:47,898
Relevance.

798
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,350
Ask a question, Mr. Abernathy.

799
00:31:52,227 --> 00:31:53,370
The day you got the call

800
00:31:53,372 --> 00:31:55,639
informing you that they
had found Sam's body,

801
00:31:56,523 --> 00:31:57,874
what were your reactions?

802
00:31:57,876 --> 00:32:00,577
Again. Relevance.

803
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,413
Overruled.

804
00:32:03,415 --> 00:32:04,881
Let the woman speak.

805
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,085
Well, there were many things.

806
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:12,255
First I thought it must be some mistake

807
00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:15,000
and then I realized it wasn't...

808
00:32:15,694 --> 00:32:17,419
that Sam was gone.

809
00:32:17,896 --> 00:32:20,839
Just... gone.

810
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:24,267
And then I realized that no one

811
00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:27,404
could look me in the eye
and tell me what happened.

812
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:31,141
That apparently, no one knew.

813
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,643
And that...

814
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:36,313
I was gonna have to live
the rest of my life

815
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,783
knowing one day I had a child,
and then the next day I didn't,

816
00:32:39,785 --> 00:32:42,419
but I would never know why.

817
00:32:42,944 --> 00:32:44,488
And then?

818
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:47,357
And then it-it started to seem like...

819
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:49,159
maybe somebody did know.

820
00:32:49,161 --> 00:32:51,428
Like, maybe there actually

821
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,930
had been people there.
Like, a lot of people.

822
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:58,168
And so, I wondered who made the choices.

823
00:32:58,627 --> 00:33:00,237
I mean, did they all

824
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:02,939
just say, “Let's...

825
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:05,408
go and get the pledges drunk”?

826
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:08,712
Did they all just decide, “Hey, let's

827
00:33:08,714 --> 00:33:10,447
throw him in the river,” even though

828
00:33:10,449 --> 00:33:12,315
they're so drunk
they can't see straight?

829
00:33:12,317 --> 00:33:14,267
And then I gue...

830
00:33:15,053 --> 00:33:18,555
I guess... when Sam drowned...

831
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:24,528
...did they all... decide,

832
00:33:25,487 --> 00:33:29,466
“Let's just not... call anybody.

833
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:33,436
“Let's... go home.

834
00:33:34,454 --> 00:33:36,673

they'd talk about Hell Night,
about pledging,

about how surviving that ordeal
made you a man,

And who ordered the defendants to drink?

941

into the water.

did you keep them there?

see Sam anymore, so...

953

we started calling his name,

00:38:22,794 --> 00:38:26,462
uh, diving into the water
to try and find him, but...

You could tell that... (CLEARS THROAT)

even think to call the police.

Nobody said a word on the walk home,

980
00:39:39,371 --> 00:39:42,138
but I think we all realized that
there was a really good chance

981
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:45,041
that our lives were gonna be
very different now.

982

And what happened
when you got back home,

983
00:39:49,481 --> 00:39:50,947
and he wasn't there?

984
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:53,349
Didn't anyone suggest
calling the authorities?

985
00:39:53,666 --> 00:39:55,551
Everybody was really drunk

986
00:39:55,553 --> 00:39:56,961
and really scared.

987
00:39:59,505 --> 00:40:00,857
Everyone just...

988
00:40:01,216 --> 00:40:02,859
went to their rooms and
either passed out or prayed

989
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:05,128
that he'd show up the next
morning, and when he didn't...

about what had happened.

993

JUDGE: You've been convicted
of manslaughter

1002

in a sad and senseless death.

1003

A young man full of life
and promise is gone.

1004
00:40:45,343 --> 00:40:47,370
And you had the power to stop it.

1005
00:40:47,929 --> 00:40:50,039
But instead, you chose to indulge

1006
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:52,208
and encourage yourself and others

1007
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:54,978
in reckless and wanton behavior.

1008

I'm taking into account that

you admitted to your role
in the incident

1010

and took responsibility for the effect

1011

I'm not one to reward bad behavior,

I'm going to make an exception.

2
00:00:16,945 --> 00:00:18,726
Hey, Ryan.
It's your big brother Stephen.

3
00:00:18,814 --> 00:00:20,164
Come on,
let me in.

4
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:24,392
I'm using my spare,
so if you're in the john,

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,011
close the damn door.

6
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:32,792
Yo, Ryan.

7
00:00:33,371 --> 00:00:35,308
I saw the poster
you called me about.

8
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,573
Yo, Ry.

9
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:45,345
Ryan, where you at?

10
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,151
Ryan, you okay?

11
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,410
You in there?

12
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:59,301
I'm coming in.

13
00:01:13,895 --> 00:01:16,260
Bull, he's an old friend,
a really old friend,

14
00:01:16,348 --> 00:01:17,416
so I need you
to be nice.

15
00:01:17,504 --> 00:01:19,294
- How long since you've seen him?
- I don't know.

16
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:20,989
Seven or eight years?

17
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,082
You haven't seen him
in seven or eight years?

18
00:01:26,301 --> 00:01:28,574
What's this casual
acquaintance's name again?

19
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:30,434
Stephen.
Stephen Raposa.

20
00:01:30,522 --> 00:01:31,761
And Bull,
I am pleading with you,

21
00:01:31,848 --> 00:01:33,043
he just lost
his younger brother,

22
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,535
so,
he's really, really fragile.

23
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,876
Are you folks
familiar with

24
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,416
the Back
to Nature Wilderness

25
00:01:38,504 --> 00:01:40,212
and Leadership Camp
for Boys?

26
00:01:40,677 --> 00:01:43,139
Of course.
It's a New York institution.

27
00:01:43,234 --> 00:01:45,649
Peter Maybrook started it,
when...

28
00:01:46,262 --> 00:01:49,259
- the early '90s?
- Right. Peter Maybrook.

29
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,923
Made that fortune

30
00:01:51,018 --> 00:01:54,142
with the chain of
upscale sporting goods stores.

31
00:01:54,358 --> 00:01:55,806
Back to Nature.

32
00:01:56,089 --> 00:01:58,801
Now, I knew some kids who went
for free. They loved it.

33
00:01:58,927 --> 00:02:00,593
Oh, me, too.
Kids from foster care.

34
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:02,506
I mean, that was his thing,
wasn't it?

35
00:02:02,594 --> 00:02:05,951
Paying for at-risk boys to get
out of the city and into nature?

36
00:02:06,134 --> 00:02:07,998
My brother and I
went to that camp.

37
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,053
I understand
you recently lost your brother.

38
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,506
Yeah, he took his own life,
actually.

39
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:20,576
He simultaneously
overdosed and slit his wrists.

40
00:02:24,238 --> 00:02:25,935
He told me
it was Maybrook.

41
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:28,584
I'm sorry.
What was Maybrook?

42
00:02:28,991 --> 00:02:31,271
He took liberties
with my brother.

43
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,881
While he was
at that camp.

44
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,389
When he was only 13.

45
00:02:37,545 --> 00:02:38,717
I see.

46
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,162
So you're accusing
Peter Maybrook of abuse.

47
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:44,904
Yes, sir.

48
00:02:45,006 --> 00:02:46,954
And did your brother
go to the police?

49
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:48,443
He did.

50
00:02:49,245 --> 00:02:51,224
He waited ten years,
but he did it.

51
00:02:52,092 --> 00:02:54,537
And of course, they didn't
believe him.

52
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,420
By then, he was
a full-blown addict

53
00:02:56,508 --> 00:02:59,282
and you know,
addicts lie.

54
00:02:59,408 --> 00:03:01,279
And he had a-a bit of a record.

55
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:07,490
And Maybrook,
Maybrook's a-a god in this town.

56
00:03:07,818 --> 00:03:09,559
And this happened,
when, 15 years ago?

57
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,997
Yeah, something like that.

58
00:03:11,282 --> 00:03:13,060
And when the police wouldn't do
nything,

59
00:03:14,332 --> 00:03:16,279
it drove Ryan
even crazier.

60
00:03:16,576 --> 00:03:18,068
He broke into
Maybrook's estate,

61
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:20,191
he stole everything
he could get his hands on.

62
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:21,311
He was coked
out of his mind.

63
00:03:21,398 --> 00:03:22,645
- Wow.
- I... Stephen,

64
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:24,535
you never told me
any of this.

65
00:03:24,623 --> 00:03:27,240
And you're seeking legal
counsel because...?

66
00:03:29,077 --> 00:03:30,389
I want to sue.

67
00:03:31,596 --> 00:03:33,444
I want to sue Maybrook.
I-I read in the paper

68
00:03:33,586 --> 00:03:35,857
about this new law
that New York just passed.

69
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,373
The Child Victims Act.

70
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:39,195
That's right.
Because there's this new law,

71
00:03:39,282 --> 00:03:41,593
there's no
statute of limitations.

72
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:45,436
Well, it's not that
there's no statute of limitations.

73
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,093
What they've done is,
for one year only,

74
00:03:48,181 --> 00:03:51,366
instituted something called
a "lookback window."

75
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,944
Any victim of child sexual abuse
can sue

76
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,108
no matter how long
ago the abuse happened.

77
00:03:58,306 --> 00:03:59,671
Well,
there you go.

78
00:04:00,037 --> 00:04:02,077
Uh, the problem is,
Mr. Raposa,

79
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:04,272
I don't think
that law applies to you.

80
00:04:04,483 --> 00:04:05,921
Your brother is deceased.

81
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:09,092
That means we have no standing
to sue on his behalf.

82
00:04:09,192 --> 00:04:12,054
Statute of limitations
or no statute of limitations.

83
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:17,553
And there's no, there's no
work-around for that? No. Not really.

84
00:04:18,363 --> 00:04:20,194
I'm so sorry, Stephen.

85
00:04:20,338 --> 00:04:22,316
So sorry for all of it.

86
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:25,210
For not seeing you for so long,

87
00:04:25,476 --> 00:04:27,476
for us not being
able to help.

88
00:04:27,992 --> 00:04:30,054
Will you call me
if there's anything else you need?

89
00:04:30,142 --> 00:04:32,663
Help with
funeral arrangements,

90
00:04:32,751 --> 00:04:33,983
anything.

91
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:41,552
Talk to me.

92
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,956
So I get that
we can't sue for Ryan.

93
00:04:44,044 --> 00:04:46,044
Ryan's gone,
so we have no standing.

94
00:04:49,862 --> 00:04:51,239
But what about me?

95
00:04:52,884 --> 00:04:54,918
I'm sorry,
w-what?

96
00:04:56,934 --> 00:04:58,268
Me.

97
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:02,528
The man molested me,
too.

98
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:04,989
So what about me?

99
00:05:05,487 --> 00:05:07,052
Can we sue
on my behalf?

100
00:05:09,231 --> 00:05:11,052

102
00:05:14,285 --> 00:05:16,325
- You okay if I...?
- Sure.

103
00:05:19,212 --> 00:05:20,833
Thanks for coming in so early.

104
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:23,497
It's just easier for me
to focus on...

105
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:26,495
...you and your story
before the chaos starts.

106
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:32,338
So, let's begin
at the beginning.

107
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:34,802
How old were you
when Peter Maybrook

108
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,432
initiated physical contact?

109
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:40,213
I was 14. It was the last summer
I spent at that camp.

110
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:43,487
So, let's talk about that summer.

111
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,870
I'm sorry, it's just, for 24
years, I never talked about it.

112
00:05:50,197 --> 00:05:52,846
I never wanted to.
Still don't want to.

113
00:05:52,994 --> 00:05:54,557
It's completely
understandable.

114
00:05:55,206 --> 00:05:58,120
But you're gonna have to tell
the story in front of a jury.

115
00:05:58,908 --> 00:06:01,518
And the best way to
prepare for that is here.

116
00:06:03,935 --> 00:06:06,237
Like I said, it was
my last summer at that camp.

117
00:06:07,323 --> 00:06:10,956
And they made me
a cabin captain.

118
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:14,141
That was a big honor,
it was a big deal.

119
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:15,164
They only picked 12 boys.

120
00:06:15,252 --> 00:06:18,576
And... it meant you got
to spend time with Maybrook.

121
00:06:18,948 --> 00:06:20,565
And that was considered a perk?

122
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,885
Oh, yeah.
Maybrook, he was,

123
00:06:22,973 --> 00:06:24,147
he was the coolest guy
on the planet.

124
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:26,019
He drove a Mustang,
he listened to Aerosmith.

125
00:06:26,106 --> 00:06:28,922
He... grew up poor like us
but now he was rich.

126
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:33,024
And... being a cabin leader meant
he knew your name.

127
00:06:33,112 --> 00:06:34,720
It meant you got to go
to this special dinner

128
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:36,362
at his estate near the camp.

129
00:06:36,745 --> 00:06:38,574
And was that the first time
you were alone with him?

130
00:06:38,661 --> 00:06:40,141
- At the dinner?
- No.

131
00:06:40,337 --> 00:06:42,377
No, all 12 of us
were there that night.

132
00:06:43,245 --> 00:06:47,779
But a few nights later,
his assistant, Lydia,

133
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:51,475
she came to me and she told me
that Maybrook wanted to see me.

134
00:06:51,813 --> 00:06:52,901
Just me.

135
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,167
I was so damn
excited.

136
00:06:55,651 --> 00:06:59,088
So that night,
did anything happen?

137
00:06:59,363 --> 00:07:00,768
Not really.

138
00:07:01,617 --> 00:07:03,643
We watched TV, we talked.

139
00:07:04,405 --> 00:07:06,320
I told him things
that I'd never told anyone,

140
00:07:06,424 --> 00:07:10,237
how my dad left, how I took care
of my little brother

141
00:07:10,324 --> 00:07:12,307
because my mom
was always working.

142
00:07:13,556 --> 00:07:15,440
It sounds like you
felt very safe.

143
00:07:17,198 --> 00:07:18,768
Yeah. Very safe.

144
00:07:20,658 --> 00:07:21,879
Then a few
nights later,

145
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:25,120
he invited me back, and then
again the following week.

146
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,104
And that was the,
that was the first time

147
00:07:27,192 --> 00:07:29,393
I ever saw him drinking.

148
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:33,397
He was drinking brandy,
and he offered me a taste

149
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:36,667
and it made me
feel really cool.

150
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:39,745
And when did the touching start?

151
00:07:40,604 --> 00:07:42,042
It was gradual.

152
00:07:42,643 --> 00:07:44,097
He kind of snuck up
on it, you know?

153
00:07:44,184 --> 00:07:47,665
We'd be talking, and he'd touch
my leg or my shoulder.

154
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:53,093
And then, one night...

155
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:56,854
...he asked me
if I wanted to shower.

156
00:07:57,798 --> 00:08:02,672
Our cabins didn't usually have
much hot water,

157
00:08:03,284 --> 00:08:04,799
but his shower,

158
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:10,120
he'd turn it on and
you'd see the steam.

159
00:08:13,112 --> 00:08:14,854
Did he get in the
shower with you?

160
00:08:16,268 --> 00:08:17,573
Yeah.

161
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:20,393
He got close.

162
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:23,266
And then, the next thing I knew,
he was touching me.

163
00:08:23,353 --> 00:08:24,604
Wanting me to touch him.

164
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:31,487
But I didn't want to,
so he-he kind of got behind me.

165
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,604
Forced himself on me.

166
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:43,477
And...
I wanted to stop him,

167
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,823
but, he was a lot bigger
than me,

168
00:08:45,911 --> 00:08:49,034
and I felt like I couldn't move.

169
00:08:52,947 --> 00:08:54,463
And I don't really
remember the rest.

170
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:57,542
It's kind of like
my mind left my body.

171
00:09:00,612 --> 00:09:05,495
Although I do remember
counting the tiles.

172
00:09:07,702 --> 00:09:09,151
182.

173
00:09:10,748 --> 00:09:12,713
Did you ever tell
anyone about this?

174
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:14,159
No.

175
00:09:15,948 --> 00:09:18,276
I think I kind of thought
it was my fault.

176
00:09:19,409 --> 00:09:23,021
Like, if I'd never
taken that brandy

177
00:09:23,108 --> 00:09:26,721
or if I said something the
first time he touched my leg...

178
00:09:30,023 --> 00:09:33,516
And then, two years later,

179
00:09:33,604 --> 00:09:36,534
m-my mom sent Ryan
to that camp.

180
00:09:40,604 --> 00:09:42,174
I still never said a word.

181
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,963
My last big project
at Homeland

182
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:50,606
was coordinating logistics
after Hurricane Sandy.

183
00:09:50,862 --> 00:09:53,752
They actually pulled a bunch
of us from counterterrorism

184
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,233
to work with the National Guard.

185
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:57,502
Stephen was a sergeant.

186
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,884
He was in charge of a
team of Army mechanics.

187
00:09:59,971 --> 00:10:01,527
Wreckage everyone else
said was too dangerous,

188
00:10:01,614 --> 00:10:03,355
Stephen found a
way to search it.

189
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,729
Pretty amazing guy.

190
00:10:04,975 --> 00:10:06,815
And you two became friends?

191
00:10:07,546 --> 00:10:09,065
More like war buddies.

192
00:10:09,153 --> 00:10:11,172
I was going through
my first divorce,

193
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,042
he was going through
one of his own.

194
00:10:13,552 --> 00:10:17,078
Neither one of us was really
looking for a new friend.

195
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:19,775
But like war buddies,
we always stayed in touch.

196
00:10:20,065 --> 00:10:22,877
Well, for what it's worth,
I did a little background check

197
00:10:22,979 --> 00:10:24,182
on your friend.

198
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,477
And I have to say,
he doesn't read

199
00:10:26,565 --> 00:10:28,652
like a trauma survivor at all.

200
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:31,351
Near as I can tell, he doesn't
have any issues with alcohol,

201
00:10:31,438 --> 00:10:33,948
drugs, anger management.

202
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:36,674
He passed all his Army
mental health reviews.

203
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:40,113
Which brings me
to the ugly question of the day.

204
00:10:40,502 --> 00:10:42,096
You think he was
actually molested?

205
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:43,299
Excuse me?

206
00:10:43,387 --> 00:10:47,682
I'm just saying,
he never mentioned it to anyone

207
00:10:47,934 --> 00:10:50,111
until yesterday when we told him
that he couldn't sue

208
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:51,729
on his brother's behalf,

209
00:10:52,297 --> 00:10:55,526
and then out of the blue,
"Well, it happened to me, too."

210
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:58,651
No. Bull spent time
with him this morning,

211
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,396
and he is 100% on board.

212
00:11:00,554 --> 00:11:02,159
Well, I defer

213
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:04,284
to the man
with all the doctorates.

214
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:06,657
He have a plan?

215
00:11:07,596 --> 00:11:11,217
He thinks our best bet...
Our only bet...

216
00:11:11,377 --> 00:11:13,635
is to establish
a pattern of conduct.

217
00:11:13,723 --> 00:11:16,206
He need us to go through
old camp records

218
00:11:16,294 --> 00:11:18,557
and reach out
to former campers

219
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:21,807
with profiles that are similar
to Ryan's and Stephen's

220
00:11:22,127 --> 00:11:23,707
and see if any
of them are willing

221
00:11:23,794 --> 00:11:25,292
to come forward
and testify.

222
00:11:25,514 --> 00:11:27,580
After spending almost
a quarter of a century

223
00:11:27,668 --> 00:11:29,354
not telling
anybody,

224
00:11:30,284 --> 00:11:32,706
yeah, that sounds
like an easy sell.

225
00:11:34,229 --> 00:11:36,385
Well, we split up
the potential witness lists.

226
00:11:36,473 --> 00:11:38,635
And I've been reaching out
to former camp staffers.

227
00:11:38,723 --> 00:11:40,332
The thing is,
everyone I talked to

228
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,857
had nothing but nice things
to say about Maybrook.

229
00:11:43,213 --> 00:11:45,713
Turns out he had
an unwritten policy,

230
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:47,336
not a single
seasonal employee

231
00:11:47,424 --> 00:11:49,370
was brought back
from one year to the next.

232
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,471
Makes sense.

233
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,518
That way no one would've
been around long enough

234
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:54,487
to suspect him
of bad behavior.

235
00:11:54,956 --> 00:11:57,829
As it turns out, the only adult
who was there year in, year out

236
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,137
was Maybrook's
assistant Lydia,

237
00:12:00,347 --> 00:12:02,088
who I had the pleasure
of speaking to.

238
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,307
And let me guess,
she wouldn't talk to you?

239
00:12:04,535 --> 00:12:05,549
Oh, she talked.

240
00:12:05,637 --> 00:12:07,635
Told me she worked for him
for almost two decades,

241
00:12:07,723 --> 00:12:09,627
told me she worshipped
the ground he walked on,

242
00:12:09,715 --> 00:12:11,325
told me I should be
ashamed of myself,

243
00:12:11,413 --> 00:12:12,893
and then she
hung up on me.

244
00:12:13,007 --> 00:12:14,965
Yeah, that sounds
about right.

245
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:18,109
Chunk and I spent the day
reaching out to former campers.

246
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,221
Oh, how did that go?

247
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:21,615
Well, we focused primarily
on cabin leaders,

248
00:12:21,703 --> 00:12:23,749
ones without strong
family support systems,

249
00:12:23,852 --> 00:12:26,550
kids who, on paper,
looked to be attractive targets

250
00:12:26,638 --> 00:12:28,684
for Maybrook and bore
some physical similarity

251
00:12:28,772 --> 00:12:29,947
to the Raposa brothers.

252
00:12:30,035 --> 00:12:31,079
And?

253
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,338
And it turns out,

254
00:12:32,426 --> 00:12:34,572
asking people
to dredge up a painful past

255
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,922
doesn't make you very popular.

256
00:12:36,127 --> 00:12:37,390
I mean,
there were definitely

257
00:12:37,477 --> 00:12:40,262
people who had nothing
but wonderful things to say,

258
00:12:40,349 --> 00:12:41,917
and then there
were others.

259
00:12:42,005 --> 00:12:44,138
I had a couple of doors
slammed in my face,

260
00:12:44,226 --> 00:12:45,662
people cursing me out,

261
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,014
saying, "How dare you come here
asking questions like that?"

262
00:12:49,358 --> 00:12:52,377
And I got to say, it's hard
to know if their indignation

263
00:12:52,465 --> 00:12:55,539
was righteous,
or if they were people

264
00:12:55,627 --> 00:12:57,555
who just didn't want
to remember,

265
00:12:57,697 --> 00:12:59,525
didn't want to be reminded.

266
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,174
- My guess would be
a little bit of both. - That's great.

267
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:04,698
So the response prove,
or at least suggest,

268
00:13:04,786 --> 00:13:06,136
this guy is guilty,

269
00:13:06,396 --> 00:13:08,174
but we have no one
besides our client

270
00:13:08,262 --> 00:13:10,893
that will get up there
and say that to the jury.

271
00:13:11,565 --> 00:13:13,815
Well, I didn't say no one.

272
00:13:14,557 --> 00:13:15,799
Alan Coleman

273
00:13:15,986 --> 00:13:18,946
went to the camp a few years
after Ryan and Stephen.

274
00:13:19,034 --> 00:13:20,995
He's, uh, an architect
in New Jersey.

275
00:13:21,206 --> 00:13:22,581
Didn't want to talk
on the phone,

276
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:25,106
but he implied
he had a story to tell.

277
00:13:25,463 --> 00:13:28,876
Well, that's a beginning.

278
00:13:30,837 --> 00:13:32,976
Uh, I remember we watched

279
00:13:33,064 --> 00:13:36,796
the 1996 Summer Olympics
earlier that night.

280
00:13:36,971 --> 00:13:38,944
Michael Johnson
won both the

281
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:43,194
200 meter and the 400 meter
sprint, and we both thought

282
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:45,283
it was great
and kind of funny

283
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,319
because he was wearing
these golden shoes.

284
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:50,496
Gold medal. Gold shoes.

285
00:13:50,724 --> 00:13:52,788
We laughed about it a lot.

286
00:13:52,987 --> 00:13:55,937
And then, uh, an hour later,

287
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:57,897
I was standing in the shower,

288
00:13:58,742 --> 00:14:00,358
my face to the wall,

289
00:14:02,361 --> 00:14:05,085
wishing that I had
these golden shoes,

290
00:14:05,173 --> 00:14:09,187
wishing that I had these shoes
so that I could run away.

291
00:14:10,972 --> 00:14:12,663
Plus, I heard that

292
00:14:13,565 --> 00:14:15,176
he was working with kids again.

293
00:14:16,124 --> 00:14:17,546
Mr. Raposa,

294
00:14:18,741 --> 00:14:21,155
given everything
you've described,

295
00:14:21,467 --> 00:14:24,122
everything you testified to,

296
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:27,858
why'd you keep it all
to yourself all these years?

297
00:14:28,298 --> 00:14:29,577
If that man

298
00:14:29,665 --> 00:14:32,804
did all the terrible things
you just testified to,

299
00:14:33,242 --> 00:14:34,577
why not expose him?

300
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,280
My brother Ryan tried.

301
00:14:36,903 --> 00:14:40,710
He told the truth over and over.
He went to the authorities.

302
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:42,546
He went to anybody
who would listen,

303
00:14:42,634 --> 00:14:43,898
and a lot of people
who wouldn't,

304
00:14:43,985 --> 00:14:47,030
but nothing changed,
and it ruined his life.

305
00:14:47,118 --> 00:14:49,999
So if you didn't
talk to anybody,

306
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:54,129
didn't go the authorities,
didn't seek out therapy,

307
00:14:54,497 --> 00:14:55,759
what did you do?

308
00:14:56,249 --> 00:14:58,663
I handled it in my own way,
I guess.

309
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:01,403
I bulked up, I joined the army
right out of high school.

310
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,851
I-I figured if I could
make myself a-a tough guy,

311
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:07,101
nobody would
ever take advantage of me again.

312
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,733
I got out of the service, I...

313
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:15,608
married a wonderful woman,
bought a little house.

314
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:19,449
I was determined
to live a normal life,

315
00:15:19,537 --> 00:15:21,496
despite what Maybrook
did to me.

316
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:22,835
And did that work?

317
00:15:23,012 --> 00:15:26,093
Well, I thought
pretty well at first.

318
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,375
And then my wife wanted kids,

319
00:15:27,462 --> 00:15:28,968
and I couldn't tell her
why I didn't.

320
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:31,014
I couldn't tell her
that I was afraid

321
00:15:31,295 --> 00:15:32,586
that I wouldn't be able
to protect them,

322
00:15:32,673 --> 00:15:34,905
the way that I couldn't
protect my brother.

323
00:15:34,993 --> 00:15:36,865
Objection.
Relevance?

324
00:15:36,998 --> 00:15:38,444
Overruled.

325
00:15:39,343 --> 00:15:40,769
You may continue.

326
00:15:41,193 --> 00:15:42,804
I don't know
what else to say.

327
00:15:44,522 --> 00:15:46,476
I thought I was fine,
and then one day,

328
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,711
I realized that
I was totally alone.

329
00:15:49,976 --> 00:15:53,107
I'd lost everything.
I lost my-my wife,

330
00:15:53,194 --> 00:15:54,444
my brother.

331
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:56,791
Thank you.

332
00:15:57,101 --> 00:15:58,929
No further questions,
Your Honor.

333
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,796
Mr. Raposa,

334
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:07,624
do you know a man by the name
of Morton Clemmons?

335
00:16:07,936 --> 00:16:10,166
Mo Clemmons? Yeah.

336
00:16:10,254 --> 00:16:11,499
Yeah, sure. I know him.

337
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:14,171
He is a loan officer,
isn't he?

338
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:16,710
Have you ever approached
him about a loan?

339
00:16:16,798 --> 00:16:18,583
Objection. Relevance?

340
00:16:18,671 --> 00:16:19,889
Uh, Your Honor,

341
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:23,092
the witness testified
that he suddenly decided

342
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,790
to tell this story
about my client

343
00:16:24,878 --> 00:16:26,585
because of a change in the law.

344
00:16:26,706 --> 00:16:29,926
I intend to prove
that there is, in fact,

345
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:31,905
another reason for his suit.

346
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:35,278
I'll allow. The witness
will answer the question.

347
00:16:36,546 --> 00:16:38,108
Yes, I applied
for a loan at the bank,

348
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:39,739
and he was
the loan officer,

349
00:16:39,827 --> 00:16:41,246
- yes.
- In fact,

350
00:16:41,343 --> 00:16:45,146
you borrowed $15,000,
didn't you?

351
00:16:45,448 --> 00:16:48,607
Yes. I retired
from the service a year ago.

352
00:16:48,695 --> 00:16:50,831
I wanted a change of pace.

353
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,217
I wanted to see
my brother more often,

354
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:54,741
so I bought a body shop
with my savings,

355
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:56,560
but the equipment,

356
00:16:57,737 --> 00:16:59,200
it needed some upgrades, so...

357
00:16:59,338 --> 00:17:02,630
So you borrowed $15,000

358
00:17:02,742 --> 00:17:05,646
and you have not been able
to make those payments

359
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,823
in a timely fashion,
have you?

360
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:10,255
Well, I think I have, mostly.

361
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,090
The last 90 days,
it's been tricky.

362
00:17:15,482 --> 00:17:18,011
My-my brother didn't have
insurance, so I had to pay

363
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:20,560
for his last round of rehab,
plus the funeral.

364
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:22,482
I have alimony payments.

365
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,138
The bank threatened to repossess
your shop, didn't they?

366
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:30,794
Do you recognize
these e-mails

367
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:33,624
between you
and Mr. Clemmons?

368
00:17:34,771 --> 00:17:36,153
Sure. Yeah.

369
00:17:36,241 --> 00:17:38,755
And would you read
the last one for me,

370
00:17:38,911 --> 00:17:42,262
the one sent on
the very morning you filed

371
00:17:42,358 --> 00:17:43,810
this lawsuit?

372
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,450
"Seriously,
no need for the repo talk.

373
00:17:46,538 --> 00:17:49,099
"I have a plan. I'll have the
funds by the end of the month,

374
00:17:49,187 --> 00:17:50,232
guaranteed."

375
00:17:50,626 --> 00:17:53,114
"By the end of the month,
guaranteed."

376
00:17:54,383 --> 00:17:58,232
Where was this cash
going to come from, Mr. Raposa?

377
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,015
My client?

378
00:18:00,297 --> 00:18:03,430
Was your plan
to slander Mr. Maybrook

379
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,503
so that you could
get your hands

380
00:18:05,591 --> 00:18:07,110
on the money you needed?

381
00:18:07,197 --> 00:18:09,466
No, of course not.

382
00:18:09,554 --> 00:18:13,123
I was going to sell
some machinery, maybe,

383
00:18:13,334 --> 00:18:15,728
or maybe try
to borrow

384
00:18:15,815 --> 00:18:18,138
a loan against
my army pension.

385
00:18:18,226 --> 00:18:20,630
Try? Maybe?

386
00:18:21,335 --> 00:18:24,338
Sounds very different
from the "guarantee"

387
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:26,021
you promise in that e-mail.

388
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,829
I was buying time,
so I exaggerated a little.

389
00:18:29,932 --> 00:18:31,372
Oh, you exaggerated a little?

390
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,302
You exaggerated.

391
00:18:34,751 --> 00:18:37,449
Turns out he exaggerated,
ladies and gentlemen,

392
00:18:37,537 --> 00:18:41,367
misrepresented the truth so that
he could get what he wanted.

393
00:18:41,525 --> 00:18:45,387
I wonder what else he has
misrepresented here today.

394
00:18:45,475 --> 00:18:46,911
- Objection.
- Sustained.

395
00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:49,130
Jury will disregard.

396
00:18:49,413 --> 00:18:50,588
Did they?

397
00:18:50,675 --> 00:18:53,216
Nope. Not a one of them.

398
00:18:53,608 --> 00:18:55,741
Every green is gone, Bull.

399
00:19:01,747 --> 00:19:04,956
Suggesting that a man is lying
about his being abused

400
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:07,114
because he has
money problems...

401
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,184
How does an attorney put that
out there with a straight face?

402
00:19:10,271 --> 00:19:12,153
Because, sadly,
it works.

403
00:19:12,403 --> 00:19:13,840
Fills the jury
with doubt,

404
00:19:13,927 --> 00:19:16,146
and the truth is, we might be
employing the same strategy

405
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:17,408
if we were
representing Maybrook.

406
00:19:17,495 --> 00:19:20,137
Except I would never be
Maybrook's attorney.

407
00:19:20,317 --> 00:19:21,884
Defend someone
who hurts children?

408
00:19:21,972 --> 00:19:23,794
That would
never happen.

409
00:19:25,341 --> 00:19:26,809
But it did work,
didn't it?

410
00:19:27,157 --> 00:19:28,606
Mm.

411
00:19:29,115 --> 00:19:31,214
Hopefully,
Danny's potential witness

412
00:19:31,302 --> 00:19:32,771
will be waiting for us
back at the office,

413
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:36,426
and with any luck, his story
will sound enough like Stephen's

414
00:19:36,514 --> 00:19:38,212
to resonate with the jury.

415
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:40,995
It was a couple of nights
after the Captain's Dinner.

416
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,958
His assistant Lydia
said he wanted to see me.

417
00:19:45,052 --> 00:19:46,873
I can't lie.

418
00:19:47,161 --> 00:19:48,657
I was pretty excited.

419
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,364
Why's that?

420
00:19:50,528 --> 00:19:53,488
'Cause my family was poor
and Maybrook wasn't.

421
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,883
He had a Sega,
he had a PS1,

422
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:00,538
all these cool cameras,
his very own darkroom.

423
00:20:00,848 --> 00:20:03,541
And I had heard sometimes
he let kids drink his liquor.

424
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,543
Are you saying
he offered you alcohol?

425
00:20:05,723 --> 00:20:06,893
Eventually.

426
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,329
How'd you feel about that?

427
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,983
Thought I'd died
and gone to heaven.

428
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:14,887
My dad was in jail.

429
00:20:15,466 --> 00:20:18,737
I lived with my aunt...
Who, between us,

430
00:20:18,825 --> 00:20:21,434
had her own issues with drugs.

431
00:20:22,212 --> 00:20:26,409
Truth is, I remember thinking,
"This is pretty good."

432
00:20:26,497 --> 00:20:27,609
Okay.

433
00:20:27,696 --> 00:20:31,918
Let's go back to the time you
spent alone with Mr. Maybrook.

434
00:20:32,177 --> 00:20:33,571
Did he touch you?

435
00:20:33,856 --> 00:20:36,574
Sure. All the time.

436
00:20:36,817 --> 00:20:39,186
At first, it was small stuff.

437
00:20:39,434 --> 00:20:43,309
He'd rub my shoulders,
squeeze my arm.

438
00:20:43,794 --> 00:20:44,917
I see.

439
00:20:45,005 --> 00:20:49,457
And did it get more intimate,
more sexual?

440
00:20:52,982 --> 00:20:54,552
Yeah.

441
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:56,286
Of course.

442
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:00,971
Can you describe
these interactions

443
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,575
you had with Maybrook?

444
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:04,880
There was no interaction.

445
00:21:05,777 --> 00:21:08,041
That would imply
two people participating.

446
00:21:08,128 --> 00:21:11,458
There was just him
getting you drunk,

447
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:14,983
getting you high,
and taking what he wanted.

448
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,180
I know it must be difficult,

449
00:21:17,496 --> 00:21:19,403
but if you could just
tell us about that.

450
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:23,184
What he did,
how he did it.

451
00:21:24,224 --> 00:21:25,513
How it felt?

452
00:21:29,062 --> 00:21:32,003
I'm sorry. I know
this is really difficult,

453
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:33,537
and I don't mean
to make you uncomfortable,

454
00:21:33,624 --> 00:21:37,554
but it's incredibly important
that the jury... hear from someone,

455
00:21:37,642 --> 00:21:40,447
anyone, other than our client.

456
00:21:41,072 --> 00:21:43,815
Someone who's been
victimized by Maybrook.

457
00:21:44,127 --> 00:21:45,556
You understand that?

458
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:47,645
If we don't ask you,

459
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,047
the other side will.

460
00:21:58,796 --> 00:22:00,920
My wife was right.
I'm sorry, I can't.

461
00:22:01,007 --> 00:22:02,171
I-I just can't do this.

462
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:03,659
Did you think
you wouldn't be asked?

463
00:22:03,762 --> 00:22:05,492
I guess I was hoping

464
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,147
it would be good enough
if I showed up.

465
00:22:07,749 --> 00:22:09,757
I don't actually think I
could go up in front

466
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:11,657
of a courtroom full of people
and go into details.

467
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:12,654
But Alan,

468
00:22:12,742 --> 00:22:15,411
without your testimony,
it is our client's word

469
00:22:15,499 --> 00:22:17,117
against Maybrook's.

470
00:22:17,414 --> 00:22:19,343
He doesn't stand
a chance.

471
00:22:20,461 --> 00:22:21,874
I know.

472
00:22:25,017 --> 00:22:27,015
But if I answer that question,

473
00:22:27,816 --> 00:22:31,156
if I say those things
out loud, in court,

474
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:34,328
in a room full of strangers,

475
00:22:35,868 --> 00:22:38,088
how long before
the whole world looks at me

476
00:22:38,445 --> 00:22:40,335
and only sees what happened?

477
00:22:41,671 --> 00:22:43,140
Sees a victim?

478
00:22:44,226 --> 00:22:46,328
Not the success
that I've become...

479
00:22:50,289 --> 00:22:52,749
...but the broken kid
I used to be.

480
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:57,843
The gullible child

481
00:22:58,151 --> 00:23:01,968
Maybrook did horrible things to.

482
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:06,367
Look,

483
00:23:06,548 --> 00:23:09,445
if it were just me,
maybe.

484
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:13,656
But I have a wife
to think about. Kids.

485
00:23:14,468 --> 00:23:17,406
How could I explain
all this to my kids?

486
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:21,169
I'm sorry. I-I wish
you and your client

487
00:23:21,257 --> 00:23:22,390
all the luck in the world.

488
00:23:22,478 --> 00:23:25,133
And I'm sorry
I wasted your time.

489
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:30,062
U-Uh, let me walk you out.

490
00:23:36,203 --> 00:23:37,799
Please sit.

491
00:23:38,421 --> 00:23:40,932
Mr. Colón, you may
call your next witness.

492
00:23:41,343 --> 00:23:44,110
Uh, Your Honor, the
witness we had scheduled

493
00:23:44,197 --> 00:23:46,880
is no longer available
to testify at this time.

494
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:48,849
We request
a continuance

495
00:23:48,937 --> 00:23:51,421
in order to secure
an adequate replacement.

496
00:23:51,835 --> 00:23:54,974
Due to the backlog on this
court's docket, and the fact

497
00:23:55,062 --> 00:23:58,117
that the events at issue here
occurred 24 years ago,

498
00:23:58,249 --> 00:24:00,732
I feel this case cannot
afford further delay.

499
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,779
I'm denying
your request.

500
00:24:01,866 --> 00:24:04,437
Uh, respectfully,

501
00:24:04,664 --> 00:24:07,742
Your Honor, though the
events of this case happened

502
00:24:07,829 --> 00:24:12,007
a long time ago, the lookback
window opened just recently.

503
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,646
We've been working under
a condensed time line,

504
00:24:14,734 --> 00:24:16,568
and we had no way
of predicting

505
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,622
this turn of events
with our witness.

506
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:21,495
Well... Be that as it may,
do you have any other witnesses

507
00:24:21,582 --> 00:24:23,714
at your disposal
at this time?

508
00:24:24,882 --> 00:24:26,045
No, Your Honor.

509
00:24:26,195 --> 00:24:27,234
Ms. Grossman,

510
00:24:27,334 --> 00:24:29,285
is the defense prepared
to call its first witness?

511
00:24:29,372 --> 00:24:30,968
We are, Your Honor.

512
00:24:31,244 --> 00:24:33,460
The defense calls
Peter Maybrook.

513
00:24:34,212 --> 00:24:37,607
The inclination
for opening the camp?

514
00:24:37,695 --> 00:24:39,966
I think that's pretty clear.

515
00:24:40,054 --> 00:24:42,708
I don't want to bore
the jury with my story.

516
00:24:42,796 --> 00:24:44,843
I'm pretty sure that
you've heard it before.

517
00:24:44,931 --> 00:24:50,130
But the essence of it is,
I grew up in the projects.

518
00:24:50,218 --> 00:24:51,404
No dad.

519
00:24:51,492 --> 00:24:53,583
Mom who wouldn't
come home

520
00:24:53,671 --> 00:24:54,963
for days at a time.

521
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,646
But when you're growing up,

522
00:24:56,734 --> 00:25:00,273
you don't know that
any of that's not normal.

523
00:25:00,523 --> 00:25:01,622
I'm sure I don't need

524
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,406
to tell you,
but they love this guy.

525
00:25:03,493 --> 00:25:05,919
Anyway, when I was 13,

526
00:25:06,007 --> 00:25:07,410
I was picked to go

527
00:25:07,497 --> 00:25:09,238
to a fresh air camp upstate

528
00:25:09,325 --> 00:25:11,742
for two weeks in the summer.

529
00:25:13,835 --> 00:25:15,367
Changed everything.

530
00:25:16,655 --> 00:25:17,890
Saved my life.

531
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:21,701
There was a counselor
up there who...

532
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:24,242
don't ask me why...
He took an interest in me.

533
00:25:24,345 --> 00:25:25,977
I know it's been almost
a quarter-century,

534
00:25:26,064 --> 00:25:28,529
but I swear this is word
for word the same nonsense

535
00:25:28,617 --> 00:25:30,738
he spewed on the
first day of camp.

536
00:25:30,825 --> 00:25:32,704
...and put me
on a horse

537
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:33,963
for the first time.

538
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:40,296
And then, after the two weeks
was up, he stayed in touch.

539
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:41,618
Wrote me letters,

540
00:25:41,705 --> 00:25:44,219
called me on the phone,
asked me

541
00:25:44,307 --> 00:25:45,471
about school.

542
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:48,158
Even dropped by
once in a while.

543
00:25:48,364 --> 00:25:50,666
Things that nobody else
was doing.

544
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,431
<i>The combination of that man,</i>

545
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:56,127
and that experience gave me

546
00:25:56,215 --> 00:26:01,768
the ability to see a future,
which was something

547
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,174
I-I had never really
contemplated before.

548
00:26:04,331 --> 00:26:08,248
So when I started
experiencing all my success,

549
00:26:08,336 --> 00:26:09,619
I just thought,

550
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:13,596
I want to recreate that
experience for someone else.

551
00:26:14,182 --> 00:26:16,549
I want to give back.

552
00:26:16,698 --> 00:26:17,750
Objection!

553
00:26:17,838 --> 00:26:19,178
Relevance, Your Honor.

554
00:26:19,265 --> 00:26:22,268
This is a sexual assault
and battery trial,

555
00:26:22,355 --> 00:26:23,930
not a testimonial dinner.

556
00:26:24,018 --> 00:26:25,391
What-what are we
listening to here?

557
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:26,359
Your Honor,

558
00:26:26,446 --> 00:26:28,317
the plaintiff and his attorney
are painting

559
00:26:28,404 --> 00:26:31,752
Mr. Maybrook's camp like
some kind of den of iniquity.

560
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,901
- It's only fair that I be...
- Enough.

561
00:26:33,989 --> 00:26:36,953
Both of you. On this point,
I'm finding myself agreeing

562
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:38,022
with Mr. Colón.

563
00:26:38,109 --> 00:26:40,330
Let's move it along,
Ms. Grossman.

564
00:26:40,418 --> 00:26:44,463
Fine. Mr. Maybrook,
did you host private dinners

565
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:47,002
for the cabin captains
at your estate?

566
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,869
I did. Yes.

567
00:26:48,957 --> 00:26:51,992
These young men had
achieved something.

568
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,300
I felt it was important
to show them

569
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,650
that hard work reaped rewards.

570
00:26:56,737 --> 00:27:00,044
The plaintiff has asserted
that you invited him back

571
00:27:00,131 --> 00:27:02,395
to your house alone
on several occasions.

572
00:27:02,635 --> 00:27:04,005
Is that also true?

573
00:27:04,213 --> 00:27:08,314
It is. You have to remember,
this was almost 25 years ago.

574
00:27:08,432 --> 00:27:10,968
The social mores have changed,

575
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:15,688
but at the time, it wasn't
unusual for a responsible adult

576
00:27:15,776 --> 00:27:18,533
to be alone with a young person
in his charge.

577
00:27:18,621 --> 00:27:21,104
That all sounds
very reasonable to me.

578
00:27:21,234 --> 00:27:25,151
But I would be remiss
if I did not ask this question:

579
00:27:25,239 --> 00:27:30,625
Mr. Maybrook, do you have
any idea why Mr. Raposa

580
00:27:30,713 --> 00:27:34,905
was able to describe
your bathroom in such detail?

581
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,560
What he said about the camper's
wash cabins was true.

582
00:27:37,647 --> 00:27:39,619
Their hot water
was inconsistent.

583
00:27:39,877 --> 00:27:42,688
So some of the young men
would occasionally ask

584
00:27:42,776 --> 00:27:45,494
to use my shower,
and I let them.

585
00:27:45,829 --> 00:27:49,005
Maybe-maybe I shouldn't have.

586
00:27:49,646 --> 00:27:51,582
And when you
allowed one of these campers

587
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:54,130
to shower in
your residence...

588
00:27:55,535 --> 00:27:59,685
...did you ever have
occasion to join them?

589
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,388
- Oh...
- To shower with them?

590
00:28:02,476 --> 00:28:03,825
My God, of course not.

591
00:28:03,913 --> 00:28:07,265
Then how do you account
for Mr. Raposa's testimony?

592
00:28:07,384 --> 00:28:09,692
I-I can't,
because it simply isn't true.

593
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,608
Now,
are-are you saying that

594
00:28:11,696 --> 00:28:13,959
you recollect it differently?

595
00:28:14,661 --> 00:28:18,685
Look, I remember Mr. Raposa.

596
00:28:19,896 --> 00:28:23,563
He was a promising
young man.

597
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:27,567
I simply wanted
to help him, period.

598
00:28:27,841 --> 00:28:32,485
So it's heartbreaking to hear
him lying about me in this way.

599
00:28:32,572 --> 00:28:35,531
I can only guess
that he needs someone to blame

600
00:28:35,618 --> 00:28:38,136
for the way that his life
turned out.

601
00:28:38,224 --> 00:28:39,622
Objection. Witness

602
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:40,754
is speculating.

603
00:28:40,841 --> 00:28:42,059
Sustained.

604
00:28:42,146 --> 00:28:44,540
The jury will disregard
Mr. Maybrook's comments.

605
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,386
You say
Mr. Raposa is lying.

606
00:28:48,474 --> 00:28:51,765
Why should the jury believe you
and not Mr. Raposa?

607
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,942
Well, let's start with the fact
that I wasn't even there.

608
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,894
I'm sorry,
how do you mean?

609
00:28:57,982 --> 00:29:00,295
The night that Mr. Raposa
keeps referencing,

610
00:29:00,382 --> 00:29:03,429
the night that Michael Johnson
won the gold in the 400

611
00:29:03,516 --> 00:29:05,300
in the Atlanta Olympics?

612
00:29:05,387 --> 00:29:07,433
I remember it perfectly.

613
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:12,786
Except it was early morning
where I was, in a pub in Dublin,

614
00:29:12,927 --> 00:29:16,442
celebrating a new store opening
with my international team.

615
00:29:16,529 --> 00:29:19,619
Order, please.

616
00:29:19,706 --> 00:29:22,143
Your
Honor, I would like

617
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:26,495
to enter this stamped
passport into evidence,

618
00:29:26,582 --> 00:29:31,805
which documents the fact
that Mr. Maybrook was,

619
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:37,487
in fact, out of the country
from mid-July

620
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:39,886
through early
August 1996,

621
00:29:39,974 --> 00:29:44,325
the exact time Mr. Raposa's
alleged abuse took place.

622
00:29:44,644 --> 00:29:45,925
So entered.

623
00:29:52,154 --> 00:29:54,792
It just doesn't make sense. Do
we believe his passport's real?

624
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,840
- He's a rich guy. Maybe...
- It's real.

625
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:58,575
Our team authenticated it.

626
00:29:58,692 --> 00:30:01,237
Also found credit card receipts
and hotel records.

627
00:30:01,325 --> 00:30:02,927
Maybrook really was in Dublin.

628
00:30:03,576 --> 00:30:05,247
I don't understand.

629
00:30:05,566 --> 00:30:07,829
You know me, Marissa.
I-I didn't make this up.

630
00:30:07,917 --> 00:30:08,911
I'm not a liar.

631
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:10,958
Of course you didn't.
Of course you aren't.

632
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:13,638
Look, I spent years
telling people

633
00:30:13,804 --> 00:30:16,114
I met my adoptive mom
on my ninth birthday.

634
00:30:16,202 --> 00:30:17,464
Years.

635
00:30:17,778 --> 00:30:19,935
I remembered that day
so clearly.

636
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:22,253
My foster mom threw a plate
at my head that morning

637
00:30:22,341 --> 00:30:23,441
because the dishes weren't done.

638
00:30:23,528 --> 00:30:25,301
Got me right here.

639
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:28,247
Anyway, that afternoon
at school, there was cake.

640
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:32,107
I wished on those candles with
all my might for a new family.

641
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,948
And who was at the social
worker's office that night

642
00:30:35,036 --> 00:30:36,456
but my new mom.

643
00:30:36,593 --> 00:30:38,291
Wow. That's amazing.

644
00:30:38,402 --> 00:30:40,058
It's also not true.

645
00:30:40,792 --> 00:30:43,259
A few years back, I was
going through old paperwork,

646
00:30:43,347 --> 00:30:45,016
and realized I hadn't
actually met my mom

647
00:30:45,103 --> 00:30:46,730
until I was nearly ten.

648
00:30:47,464 --> 00:30:50,020
Memory. It's malleable.

649
00:30:50,542 --> 00:30:52,545
Especially when it comes
to children.

650
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:55,157
Especially when it comes
to trauma.

651
00:30:56,106 --> 00:30:57,636
So what does this mean
for my case?

652
00:30:57,724 --> 00:30:59,456
It means we call
a rebuttal witness.

653
00:30:59,596 --> 00:31:01,558
It's why we asked
for a day's continuance,

654
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:04,665
so we can line up some experts
who can explain to the jury

655
00:31:04,753 --> 00:31:07,938
that PTSD can lead to the
repression of some memories

656
00:31:08,026 --> 00:31:10,172
and the conflation of others.

657
00:31:10,722 --> 00:31:12,175
Don't worry.

658
00:31:13,131 --> 00:31:14,573
We'll get through this.

659
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:16,589
We're not done.

660
00:31:19,174 --> 00:31:22,009
Oh.

661
00:31:22,097 --> 00:31:23,359
Hallelujah.

662
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:24,838
You have to share.

663
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,394
The child psychologist

664
00:31:26,482 --> 00:31:28,292
I reached out to,
the one who specializes

665
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,587
in trauma and memory?

666
00:31:29,675 --> 00:31:31,565
She just texted "yes."

667
00:31:32,104 --> 00:31:34,321
She's agreed
to meet with Stephen,

668
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:36,111
and if that meeting goes well,

669
00:31:36,198 --> 00:31:37,895
she's willing to testify
on his behalf.

670
00:31:38,378 --> 00:31:40,637
If only that were
all there was to it.

671
00:31:40,925 --> 00:31:42,378
What are you talking about?

672
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:45,033
Maybrook's attorney
just e-mailed me

673
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,730
an updated witness list.

674
00:31:46,893 --> 00:31:48,549
There are more names
on here

675
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:50,355
than the credits
of a Marvel movie.

676
00:31:52,363 --> 00:31:54,452
Camp alumni, former staffers,

677
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,107
his head of
philanthropic giving.

678
00:31:56,195 --> 00:31:58,362
All people who are gonna
sing Maybrook's praises

679
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,017
to the high heavens.

680
00:32:00,215 --> 00:32:02,478
Got it.
She's gonna inundate the jury

681
00:32:02,566 --> 00:32:03,651
with character witnesses.

682
00:32:03,739 --> 00:32:06,105
So by the time
we get our shot at rebuttal,

683
00:32:06,193 --> 00:32:08,055
the jury will be so weary,
they won't even hear

684
00:32:08,143 --> 00:32:09,315
what we have to say.

685
00:32:09,403 --> 00:32:10,690
Wait a second.

686
00:32:11,066 --> 00:32:13,269
Is this the entire list?
Is this everyone?

687
00:32:13,652 --> 00:32:15,519
It's three pages long, Taylor.
You want more?

688
00:32:15,607 --> 00:32:16,696
No, I just...

689
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,064
Lydia Helms,
his former assistant.

690
00:32:19,152 --> 00:32:20,839
How come she's not on the list?

691
00:32:21,385 --> 00:32:22,753
Lydia.

692
00:32:23,378 --> 00:32:25,027
She's the one
Stephen talked about.

693
00:32:25,115 --> 00:32:27,542
Mr. Coleman, the other night
in my office.

694
00:32:28,095 --> 00:32:29,737
She would make the approach.

695
00:32:29,901 --> 00:32:32,128
She would invite them
up to the house.

696
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:34,995
Didn't Marissa reach out
to her before the trial?

697
00:32:35,141 --> 00:32:37,169
Yeah. She worked
with him for years.

698
00:32:37,257 --> 00:32:38,955
Apparently she just loved him.

699
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:41,537
But if that's the case,
why isn't the defense

700
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:42,610
putting her on the stand?

701
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,828
Can I help you?

702
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:53,203
Yes. I'm looking for Mrs.
Helms. Mrs. Lydia Helms.

703
00:32:53,344 --> 00:32:54,405
And you are...

704
00:32:54,492 --> 00:32:55,623
I'm Dr. Jason Bull.

705
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,625
I'm representing
Mr. Stephen Raposa

706
00:32:57,712 --> 00:32:59,695
in a civil suit against
Peter Maybrook,

707
00:32:59,783 --> 00:33:01,089
who I believe
you worked for.

708
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:04,067
You know, I've already
had this conversation

709
00:33:04,154 --> 00:33:05,844
with a woman from your office.

710
00:33:06,508 --> 00:33:09,903
As I explained to her,
I really have nothing to say.

711
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:11,656
Right.

712
00:33:13,445 --> 00:33:15,586
Aren't you worried
he's gonna do it again?

713
00:33:19,172 --> 00:33:20,953
I'd be grateful
if you'd invite me in.

714
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,938
I'll only need ten
minutes of your time.

715
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:26,953
Save us both the trouble of
me having to subpoena you.

716
00:33:27,155 --> 00:33:28,286
The truth is,

717
00:33:28,374 --> 00:33:30,320
I don't know anything.

718
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:33,289
Not for certain, not that
I'd swear to in court.

719
00:33:33,586 --> 00:33:34,844
But you suspected
something.

720
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:36,758
Not until that last summer.

721
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:38,914
Peter decided
to close the camp.

722
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:42,352
Anyway, we-we were
selling the estate,

723
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,524
and I was helping
to prepare for the move.

724
00:33:45,469 --> 00:33:47,196
Peter was
an avid photographer,

725
00:33:47,284 --> 00:33:48,842
and I knew he loved
his darkroom,

726
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:52,336
so I decided I would just
pack it myself.

727
00:33:53,438 --> 00:33:56,235
And did you see something
in the darkroom?

728
00:33:57,016 --> 00:33:58,492
Not what you think.

729
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:00,875
Nothing lewd.

730
00:34:01,646 --> 00:34:05,711
Just... pictures of boys.

731
00:34:07,347 --> 00:34:08,578
Everywhere.

732
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:11,719
And taken with
such affection.

733
00:34:12,977 --> 00:34:16,506
He made them all look beautiful,
like-like an artist

734
00:34:16,594 --> 00:34:19,272
when he paints his lover
or his muse.

735
00:34:20,164 --> 00:34:21,899
It was like he was
trying to

736
00:34:22,305 --> 00:34:25,391
desperately capture something,
hold onto something.

737
00:34:27,515 --> 00:34:29,455
It felt intensely private.

738
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:34,133
Hello.

739
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,990
Stephen, am I catching you
at dinner?

740
00:34:36,078 --> 00:34:38,238
It's Jason Bull.
There's something I'd like to ask you.

741
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:39,516
Sure.

742
00:34:39,604 --> 00:34:42,512
Do you remember Maybrook
ever taking photos of you,

743
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,602
or maybe the two
of you together?

744
00:34:44,789 --> 00:34:47,953
Uh, no. I remember hearing
he had a darkroom,

745
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,173
but I don't remember him
taking pictures. Why?

746
00:34:50,461 --> 00:34:53,176
Did Ryan ever talk about
Maybrook taking pictures?

747
00:34:53,328 --> 00:34:54,779
Ryan talked about
a lot of things

748
00:34:54,867 --> 00:34:55,830
when it came to Maybrook.

749
00:34:55,917 --> 00:34:57,891
Mostly I tried to tune him out.

750
00:34:58,067 --> 00:35:00,965
But I do remember the night
he ransacked Maybrook's place.

751
00:35:01,053 --> 00:35:03,141
He brought back
three or four cameras.

752
00:35:03,781 --> 00:35:06,015
I figured he probably wanted
to sell them for drug money,

753
00:35:06,102 --> 00:35:08,017
so I took them, hid them.

754
00:35:08,281 --> 00:35:10,019
I didn't want him
getting caught.

755
00:35:10,106 --> 00:35:11,703
Getting in more trouble.

756
00:35:12,164 --> 00:35:13,477
You took them.

757
00:35:13,588 --> 00:35:15,633
Any chance you still have 'em?

758
00:35:18,196 --> 00:35:20,896
Your Honor, in light
of some new evidence

759
00:35:20,984 --> 00:35:23,139
that's just been brought
to our attention,

760
00:35:23,227 --> 00:35:24,880
the plaintiff would like
to recall

761
00:35:24,967 --> 00:35:26,727
Peter Maybrook to the stand.

762
00:35:31,149 --> 00:35:34,334
Mr. Maybrook, now, I understand

763
00:35:34,422 --> 00:35:36,688
you have an interest
in photography.

764
00:35:36,892 --> 00:35:38,329
I do.Ah.

765
00:35:39,977 --> 00:35:41,854
Do you recognize this camera?

766
00:35:42,086 --> 00:35:44,639
I believe it belonged
to you at one time.

767
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:47,294
I-I have no idea.

768
00:35:47,381 --> 00:35:50,341
I-I may have had
a camera like that in the past.

769
00:35:50,953 --> 00:35:53,305
Oh, well,

770
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,904
w-would it surprise you to learn

771
00:35:56,992 --> 00:35:59,828
that your fingerprints
were found on this camera?

772
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:03,170
Or that we contacted
the manufacturer

773
00:36:03,258 --> 00:36:06,547
and learned that
you sent a warranty card

774
00:36:06,738 --> 00:36:11,117
for a camera with the exact
same serial numbers as this one?

775
00:36:11,746 --> 00:36:14,578
It seems like it might have
been my camera.Ah.

776
00:36:14,666 --> 00:36:16,117
Ha-ha, well,

777
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:18,719
I appreciate you
conceding that, sir.

778
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:20,922
See, but here's the thing.

779
00:36:22,027 --> 00:36:25,711
Did you know
the reason we found this camera...

780
00:36:26,477 --> 00:36:29,219
the reason I am able
to show it to you here today

781
00:36:29,423 --> 00:36:33,993
is because Ryan Raposa,
my client's late brother,

782
00:36:34,218 --> 00:36:35,547
stole it from you?

783
00:36:37,438 --> 00:36:38,903
You remember that?

784
00:36:39,383 --> 00:36:42,625
About ten years ago,
your home was burglarized.

785
00:36:43,477 --> 00:36:46,136
I believe, along with
everything else,

786
00:36:46,223 --> 00:36:48,156
four cameras were taken.

787
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:52,047
Did you know that
Ryan was the thief?

788
00:36:53,026 --> 00:36:56,029
Turns out he was...
he was very angry with you.

789
00:36:56,232 --> 00:36:58,242
Even after all these years.

790
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,789
See, I'm guessing
you never knew.

791
00:37:01,984 --> 00:37:03,588
I'm guessing you never
told the police

792
00:37:03,675 --> 00:37:06,359
because you were afraid
of what they might find here.

793
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,437
Turns out it's been
in my client's basement

794
00:37:08,524 --> 00:37:09,333
this whole time.

795
00:37:09,469 --> 00:37:11,204
Objection. Relevance.

796
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:13,906
I don't see what this has
to do with anything.

797
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,949
Your Honor,
if you will permit me,

798
00:37:17,036 --> 00:37:19,169
I assure you that
I will prove to the court

799
00:37:19,256 --> 00:37:20,664
just how relevant
this camera is.

800
00:37:20,752 --> 00:37:21,961
Go ahead.

801
00:37:22,049 --> 00:37:26,172
To make things easier
for everyone to see,

802
00:37:26,408 --> 00:37:30,455
I'm gonna connect this camera
to this computer,

803
00:37:30,643 --> 00:37:34,477
and broadcast the images

804
00:37:34,891 --> 00:37:38,536
to the monitor
right next to Mr. Maybrook.

805
00:37:38,766 --> 00:37:41,750
Hey, is that you in the photo
there, Mr. Maybrook?

806
00:37:42,445 --> 00:37:44,396
Ten or so years ago,
yes.

807
00:37:44,484 --> 00:37:45,906
Ah.

808
00:37:45,994 --> 00:37:47,969
What about this photo?

809
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:50,896
Hmm?

810
00:37:51,305 --> 00:37:53,203
Now, what was going on there?

811
00:37:54,024 --> 00:37:55,883
You set up a timer
or something?

812
00:37:58,219 --> 00:37:59,818
Ah, that's okay.

813
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:02,078
That's all right.

814
00:38:02,503 --> 00:38:03,908
I was just trying to figure out

815
00:38:03,996 --> 00:38:05,867
if there was a third person
in the room.

816
00:38:06,815 --> 00:38:08,828
That's not important, right?

817
00:38:09,088 --> 00:38:12,209
What is important is that
we all agree that

818
00:38:12,297 --> 00:38:14,774
that is you in the photo.

819
00:38:15,312 --> 00:38:17,107
On the left-hand side
of the frame

820
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:20,305
with your shirt off
and your arms around...

821
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:23,197
We'll get to him in a minute.

822
00:38:23,425 --> 00:38:24,774
That you, sir?

823
00:38:26,246 --> 00:38:27,646
It seems to be.

824
00:38:27,734 --> 00:38:30,602
I'm sorry, I need a yes or no.

825
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:32,198
Mr. Maybrook?

826
00:38:34,085 --> 00:38:35,086
Yes.

827
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:38,188
What about the boy
in this photo?

828
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:41,359
That boy right there.

829
00:38:42,062 --> 00:38:44,149
He must be about 13.

830
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,287
He has his shirt off, too,

831
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:47,909
and you two are
holding each other.

832
00:38:48,148 --> 00:38:50,008
You happen to remember
his name?

833
00:38:52,258 --> 00:38:53,938
I'm not sure.

834
00:38:55,515 --> 00:38:58,453
Roberto... Renaldo...

835
00:38:59,834 --> 00:39:01,102
I'm not sure.

836
00:39:01,396 --> 00:39:02,832
Eh, you're not sure.

837
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:06,142
That's all right,
that's all right, Mr. Maybrook.

838
00:39:06,363 --> 00:39:07,799
What about this photo?

839
00:39:07,886 --> 00:39:10,105
That you?

840
00:39:10,296 --> 00:39:11,625
In the picture?

841
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:15,914
Let the record reflect that
I have just shown the defendant

842
00:39:16,031 --> 00:39:19,376
a photo of himself naked

843
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:22,641
in a bathroom with a minor!

844
00:39:25,512 --> 00:39:27,555
Actually, I'm not certain
that is me.

845
00:39:28,227 --> 00:39:29,570
Yeah?

846
00:39:29,831 --> 00:39:32,969
Hey, let me remind you that
you are still under oath.

847
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:35,434
I'd also like you to know
that I've got

848
00:39:35,522 --> 00:39:38,508
33 more images
very much like this one,

849
00:39:38,633 --> 00:39:41,311
and I am happy to show the court
all of them,

850
00:39:41,398 --> 00:39:44,009
and ask you to identify yourself
on each and every one.

851
00:39:44,096 --> 00:39:47,317
Or you can concede that
that is you,

852
00:39:47,483 --> 00:39:49,758
and for the moment,
the slide show is over.

853
00:39:50,415 --> 00:39:51,720
Your choice.

854
00:39:57,405 --> 00:39:59,086
Actually, uh...

855
00:40:00,417 --> 00:40:02,172
on reflection...

856
00:40:05,204 --> 00:40:06,930
...I believe that is me.

857
00:40:13,563 --> 00:40:14,945
Oh, God.

858
00:40:15,345 --> 00:40:17,234
Bull, tell Stephen he did it.

859
00:40:17,827 --> 00:40:19,652
I think he knows, Marissa.

860
00:40:20,102 --> 00:40:21,699
I think he knows.

861
00:40:28,111 --> 00:40:29,664
You think he's happy?

862
00:40:29,906 --> 00:40:32,534
I didn't know him,
other than what you told me.

863
00:40:32,622 --> 00:40:36,495
But you picked a beautiful spot
for his ashes.

864
00:40:38,672 --> 00:40:40,457
$35 million.

865
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,896
You think it-it even
matters to him?

866
00:40:42,984 --> 00:40:44,287
To Maybrook?

867
00:40:44,524 --> 00:40:47,028
Obviously, I'm going
to donate it.

868
00:40:47,115 --> 00:40:48,334
I don't know to whom
just yet.

869
00:40:48,421 --> 00:40:50,771
Some worthy cause.

870
00:40:57,996 --> 00:40:59,930
I know it's supposed
to make me feel better.

871
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,956
I know it's his punishment,
but I swear to you,

872
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:04,641
the whole time that we were
sitting there in court,

873
00:41:05,743 --> 00:41:07,570
money never crossed my mind.

874
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:10,053
I think I somehow
convinced myself that

875
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:12,180
they'd do something to him.

876
00:41:12,525 --> 00:41:14,609
Not just take
some of his money.

877
00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:17,915
I'm pretty sure Ryan's
in heaven rolling his eyes.

878
00:41:18,773 --> 00:41:21,228
Okay, if you are done
feeling sorry for yourself

879
00:41:21,323 --> 00:41:23,804
because all you got was
$35 million you never wanted,

880
00:41:23,891 --> 00:41:25,763
I think I have
some good news for you.

881
00:41:26,266 --> 00:41:27,758
What? What is it?

882
00:41:28,031 --> 00:41:30,347
Peter Maybrook was
just arrested.

883
00:41:34,903 --> 00:41:36,514
But how?
How is that possible?

884
00:41:36,602 --> 00:41:38,952
The statute of limitations
on criminal charges...

885
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,260
I didn't want you
to get your hopes up,

886
00:41:40,347 --> 00:41:42,219
but Bull had a strong hunch
that if Maybrook had

887
00:41:42,306 --> 00:41:44,576
taken pictures of himself
with underage boys in the past,

888
00:41:44,664 --> 00:41:46,000
he probably took pictures
of himself

889
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:48,024
with underage boys
in the present.

890
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:50,744
So Danny worked with
an old NYPD colleague

891
00:41:50,831 --> 00:41:52,820
to drum up probable cause,

892
00:41:53,055 --> 00:41:54,661
and they raided his office
this morning.

893
00:41:54,748 --> 00:41:55,664
Bull was right.

894
00:41:55,752 --> 00:41:57,992
Maybrook is going away
for life.

895
00:42:01,031 --> 00:42:03,609
You think maybe Ryan's done
with his eye-rolling?

896
00:42:06,137 --> 00:42:07,633
Yeah, I think so.

897
00:42:09,503 --> 00:42:10,836
Thank you.

1
00:00:00,804 --> 00:00:02,188
Cell phone number's
on the counter,

2
00:00:02,273 --> 00:00:04,046
so is the doctor,
so is the dad.

3
00:00:04,293 --> 00:00:06,038
Do your best.
We'll be home by midnight.

4
00:00:06,123 --> 00:00:07,133
- 1:00 at the latest.
- Got it.

5
00:00:07,217 --> 00:00:07,937
1:00?

6
00:00:08,022 --> 00:00:11,469
I-I don't do 1:00.
I do, like, 10:00.

7
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:12,774
You do, like, 9:00.

8
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:13,868
Well, you’re in New York,

9
00:00:13,953 --> 00:00:15,353
and I only get to see you
once a year.

10
00:00:15,437 --> 00:00:17,523
So tonight we're going out
like grown-ups,

11
00:00:17,608 --> 00:00:19,787
which means we'll get home
when we get home.

12
00:00:20,232 --> 00:00:21,756
Okay. All right, kiddo.

13
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:23,875
Mwah.
Lights out at 10:00.

14
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,921
Hey, hey.
Hug before I go.

15
00:00:30,372 --> 00:00:31,983
All right.

16
00:00:32,076 --> 00:00:34,037
See you in the morning,
sweet boy.

17
00:00:35,164 --> 00:00:36,790
And then

18
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:39,859
they asked me if I'd consider
becoming vice principal.

19
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:42,313
Caroline, you never told me.

20
00:00:42,398 --> 00:00:44,031
I know.
I never told anyone.

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,460
And I never got back
to them, either.

22
00:00:47,904 --> 00:00:50,243
But you love teaching.
You love education.

23
00:00:50,328 --> 00:00:51,195
You love all that.

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,828
Well, yeah.
I mean, I do, or...

25
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,481
at least I did when I was 20
and I didn't understand

26
00:00:57,566 --> 00:00:58,726
how the world worked.

27
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,032
I mean, I know I'll probably
do it for the rest of my life

28
00:01:01,116 --> 00:01:03,426
and I get a ton of
satisfaction from it,

29
00:01:03,572 --> 00:01:07,281
but it is so hard
to make ends meet.

30
00:01:07,366 --> 00:01:08,374
Mm.

31
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:10,450
I mean, Henry's just six
years away from college.

32
00:01:10,535 --> 00:01:13,411
I... I can't even imagine
how I'm gonna pay for that.

33
00:01:13,495 --> 00:01:17,085
And, I don't know,
someday I'd...

34
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,327
just love to have somebody
do my nails for me.

35
00:01:21,505 --> 00:01:22,639
You know?

36
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:24,678
Ugh, Caroline.

37
00:01:26,725 --> 00:01:28,164
And sometimes,

38
00:01:28,366 --> 00:01:30,689
in the middle of the
night, I-I can't sleep,

39
00:01:30,773 --> 00:01:32,865
so I'll watch a couple of
those house-flipping shows

40
00:01:32,949 --> 00:01:35,194
and I think,
I could do that.

41
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:38,938
I just need a hundred grand
and six months to myself.

42
00:01:39,302 --> 00:01:41,221
You know if I had a hundred grand,
I'd give it to you.

43
00:01:41,305 --> 00:01:43,866
I would make us
so crazy rich.

44
00:01:44,287 --> 00:01:46,147
Tomorrow we're getting
our nails done.

45
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:47,497
Then flip a house?

46
00:01:49,165 --> 00:01:50,639
Caroline!

47
00:01:51,924 --> 00:01:53,538

00:02:03,632 --> 00:02:04,694
My friend!

54
00:02:04,779 --> 00:02:05,756
- Call 911!
<i>- Hey, come on,</i>

55
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,116

57
00:02:09,432 --> 00:02:11,133
No!

58
00:02:11,357 --> 00:02:14,101
No, no. God, no!

59
00:02:15,753 --> 00:02:18,147
Somebody help me!

60
00:02:29,109 --> 00:02:30,374
Anything new?

61
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:33,451
No. She's still in surgery.

62
00:02:36,265 --> 00:02:37,967
Mauricio still
with the sitter?

63
00:02:38,235 --> 00:02:40,303
Yeah, so is Caroline's son.

64
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:44,280
Have you called his father?

65
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:47,639
There is no father.
He's adopted.

66
00:02:51,483 --> 00:02:53,405
Danny have any luck
finding the car?

67
00:02:53,514 --> 00:02:56,834
No, but she is all over
her contacts at the NYPD.

68
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:00,131
Should have gotten
the license plate number.

69
00:03:00,343 --> 00:03:02,649
Uh, Taylor, how many
black Lamborghini SUVs

70
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:04,163
can there be
in the city?

71
00:03:04,248 --> 00:03:05,506
We will find it.

72
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:08,356
Ms. Rentzel?

73
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,014
You came in with
Caroline Collins?

74
00:03:13,658 --> 00:03:14,836
Yes.

75
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:16,499
Maybe we should go
somewhere more private.

76
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:17,850
Why?

77
00:03:18,205 --> 00:03:21,251
I'm sorry, but your friend
died on the operating table.

78
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:25,154
When we got into
surgery, we discovered

79
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:27,723
one of her broken ribs
pierced her aorta.

80
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:29,457
We did everything
we could,

81
00:03:29,674 --> 00:03:32,463
but the internal bleeding
was simply too severe.

82
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:34,584
- No!
- I'm so sorry.

83
00:03:34,856 --> 00:03:38,756
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be okay.

84
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:41,790
It'll be okay.

85
00:03:45,776 --> 00:03:47,955
It's gonna
be... it's gonna be okay.

86
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,483
Taylor, Taylor, Taylor.

87
00:03:49,651 --> 00:03:50,826
Taylor...

88
00:03:54,155 --> 00:03:55,939
Come in!

89
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,006
Taylor.

90
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:03,155
I'm so sorry.

91
00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:05,708
Oh...

92
00:04:05,902 --> 00:04:07,687
Come on, have a seat.

93
00:04:13,283 --> 00:04:14,703
Marissa tells me...

94
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:17,569
...you've been best
friends forever.

95
00:04:18,081 --> 00:04:20,194
We met
in the second grade.

96
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,780
How is her son doing?
Henry?

97
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:30,326
He's... destroyed.

98
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:34,420
I brought him with me.

99
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:36,100
I didn't know
what else to do.

100
00:04:36,574 --> 00:04:38,143
Chunk's giving him
the grand tour.

101
00:04:38,243 --> 00:04:39,444
Trying to, anyway.

102
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:43,569
I think he just wants to
crawl into a corner and cry.

103
00:04:43,707 --> 00:04:44,842
Hmm.

104
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:49,092
All right, well,
I'll get right to it.

105
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:51,196
The NYPD found
the driver

106
00:04:51,297 --> 00:04:52,983
who struck and killed
your friend.

107
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:55,928
She is an 18-year-old
young woman named

108
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,655
Sonya Waliczek.

109
00:04:57,984 --> 00:04:59,815
Oh, my God.
That's amazing.

110
00:05:00,047 --> 00:05:01,443
Who is she? Was she drunk?

111
00:05:01,528 --> 00:05:03,794
Was she high?
Is she in jail?

112
00:05:04,225 --> 00:05:07,037
Actually, she is the daughter
of a foreign diplomat.

113
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,739
Which means, even though
she broke the law,

114
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,944
even though she killed
your friend,

115
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:15,319
she's protected
by diplomatic immunity.

116
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,733
She can't be charged,
she can't be held.

117
00:05:19,982 --> 00:05:23,803
She can't even be tried
for what she did.

118
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:27,880
Just before you came in,

119
00:05:27,965 --> 00:05:29,889
I was on the phone
with your friend's attorney.

120
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:34,444
Are you aware that,
in the event of her untimely death,

121
00:05:34,998 --> 00:05:38,233
she had appointed you
Henry's legal guardian?

122
00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:43,006
Wow.

123
00:05:43,308 --> 00:05:44,764
Okay.

124
00:05:46,326 --> 00:05:49,425
It was a conversation we had
when she first adopted Henry,

125
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:51,826
but it's not something
we've talked about ever since.

126
00:05:52,472 --> 00:05:55,749
Well, according to the attorney,
that's the plan.

127
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:57,186
That's what's in the will.

128
00:05:58,736 --> 00:06:00,522
How do you feel about that?

129
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:03,400
How well do you know
this boy?

130
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:07,865
I see him once a year
when his mom comes to visit.

131
00:06:10,888 --> 00:06:15,498
But, honestly,
if it's what Caroline wanted...

132
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:20,108
You know, just because it's what
she wanted for her baby

133
00:06:20,192 --> 00:06:22,093
a dozen years ago
doesn't necessarily mean

134
00:06:22,178 --> 00:06:24,743
it's what she would have
wanted for him today.

135
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,188
He's a preadolescent.

136
00:06:28,592 --> 00:06:30,733
I'm betting his life
is pretty full.

137
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,851
Uprooting him
from Denver,

138
00:06:32,936 --> 00:06:34,296
moving him to New York,

139
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,420
on top of all the other changes
in his life

140
00:06:36,505 --> 00:06:38,201
he has no
control over...

141
00:06:41,358 --> 00:06:42,905
I don't know, Taylor.

142
00:06:43,858 --> 00:06:46,240
Even Caroline might have thought
differently if she was

143
00:06:46,325 --> 00:06:48,490
presented with
the choice today.

144
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,498
He's gone for the day!

145
00:06:53,022 --> 00:06:54,882
Are you heading
out soon?

146
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:57,194
Oh, yes.
Mere minutes away.

147
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:01,780
Just have to find a way to look
Taylor in the eye and say,

148
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,594
"We're gonna prosecute that girl
who mowed down your friend,

149
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:08,025
"so the most interesting thing
about her life won't be

150
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,131
"that the person who killed
her got away with it.

151
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,280
We're gonna
make this right."

152
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,191
Honestly?
Mere minutes away.

153
00:07:15,432 --> 00:07:18,326
I'm sorry, I just can't believe
the government not only allows

154
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:20,350
diplomats
to run people down,

155
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,605
it gives their kids
immunity, too.

156
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:24,259
Well, it's a
necessary evil.

157
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:28,002
Without diplomatic immunity,
our diplomats would be at risk

158
00:07:28,086 --> 00:07:31,005
of prosecution on trumped-up
charges in foreign countries.

159
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:33,309
Especially in places
where the U.S. is unpopular.

160
00:07:34,963 --> 00:07:36,098
Taylor.

161
00:07:36,338 --> 00:07:38,006
Sorry to startle you.

162
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:39,913
Taylor, what are you doing here?

163
00:07:39,998 --> 00:07:40,999
You're supposed to be
taking the day off.

164
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:44,038
It's okay. Henry and Mauricioare
at the movies with my ex.

165
00:07:44,123 --> 00:07:47,042
The thing is, I found something.

166
00:07:47,236 --> 00:07:48,671
On the night of the accident,

167
00:07:48,756 --> 00:07:51,112
Sonya posted tons of
pics of herself out partying.

168
00:07:51,196 --> 00:07:52,381
And there's
the same girl

169
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:54,210
in almost every photo.

170
00:07:54,443 --> 00:07:56,178
Her name is Jade Bennington.

171
00:07:58,162 --> 00:08:00,339
See how Sonya's wearing a black dress?

172
00:08:00,826 --> 00:08:01,998
Okay.

173
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,538
So, right after
the accident,

174
00:08:03,623 --> 00:08:05,155
the driver got out of the car

175
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,325
for just a second
and I saw her.

176
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,116
She was wearing a red jacket.

177
00:08:09,647 --> 00:08:10,653
Well, maybe Sonya

178
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:12,381
was cold and borrowed
her friend's jacket?

179
00:08:12,473 --> 00:08:15,201
I thought of that, but that's
not the only thing that I found.

180
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:18,131
Now let me
show you something.

181
00:08:20,271 --> 00:08:21,990
Why is her arm in a sling?

182
00:08:22,184 --> 00:08:24,936
Exactly. And see the abrasions
on her face?

183
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,192
Kind of looks like she might
have been on the wrong side

184
00:08:27,276 --> 00:08:28,432
of an airbag, don't you think?

185
00:08:28,516 --> 00:08:29,781
Meanwhile,

186
00:08:30,748 --> 00:08:32,588
Sonya doesn't have
so much as a scratch

187
00:08:32,672 --> 00:08:34,721
in any of the pictures
following the accident.

188
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:35,896
So, then what if Sonya

189
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,561
wasn't driving at all?

190
00:08:37,646 --> 00:08:39,564
What if it was her friend,
who almost certainly

191
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:41,998
doesn't have
diplomatic immunity?

192
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:44,741
Exactly.
What do you think?

193
00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:48,334
I think maybe you, me and
Benny take a trip

194
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:50,545
to the D.A.'s office
in the morning.

195
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:53,563

197
00:08:56,146 --> 00:08:57,217
Mr. Rentzel,

198
00:08:57,302 --> 00:08:59,772
I reviewed everything
you sent over.

199
00:09:00,428 --> 00:09:01,886
And I'm sorry.

200
00:09:02,295 --> 00:09:04,476
I'm not gonna bring charges
against Jade Bennington

201
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:06,322
for the death of your friend.

202
00:09:07,888 --> 00:09:10,217
A.D.A. Fredericks,
you've got an eyewitness

203
00:09:10,311 --> 00:09:12,398
who puts Ms. Bennington
in the driver's seat.

204
00:09:12,483 --> 00:09:14,187
You've got visual evidence
of injuries

205
00:09:14,272 --> 00:09:15,687
that puts her
in the driver's seat.

206
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:18,682
The ambassador's
daughter confessed.

207
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:21,069
Excuse me?

208
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,950
Uh...

209
00:09:23,592 --> 00:09:27,030
Sonya Waliczek?
The owner of the Lamborghini?

210
00:09:28,155 --> 00:09:30,913
She confessed
she was driving the car

211
00:09:30,998 --> 00:09:32,967
when your friend
was struck and killed.

212
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:34,608
Well, I'm
sure you'll concede

213
00:09:34,693 --> 00:09:37,177
Ms. Waliczek could be lying
to protect her friend.

214
00:09:37,262 --> 00:09:38,919
She knows
we can't go after her.

215
00:09:39,268 --> 00:09:41,554
That may be,
but as I'm sure you know,

216
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,536
it's nearly impossible
to get a jury

217
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,795
to find someone guilty when
someone else has confessed.

218
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:50,046
I just can't devote
resources to a case

219
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,451
I'm certain I'm gonna lose.

220
00:09:52,803 --> 00:09:55,053
What if we went civil
instead of criminal?

221
00:09:58,013 --> 00:09:59,405
How do you mean?

222
00:09:59,638 --> 00:10:02,147
Well, what if Taylor brought
a wrongful death suit

223
00:10:02,264 --> 00:10:05,384
against Jade Bennington,
on behalf of Henry?

224
00:10:06,037 --> 00:10:07,342
Can we do that?

225
00:10:07,426 --> 00:10:08,779
I don't see why not.

226
00:10:08,863 --> 00:10:10,215
No, the real
question is,

227
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:11,733
can we win?

228
00:10:13,131 --> 00:10:14,709
Won't know till we try.

229
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,327
Our biggest challenge
is gonna be

230
00:10:17,412 --> 00:10:19,100
putting Jade
behind the wheel.

231
00:10:19,498 --> 00:10:22,311
That's easy. My testimony
puts Jade behind the wheel.

232
00:10:22,572 --> 00:10:24,569
No, unfortunately,
your testimony

233
00:10:24,662 --> 00:10:28,022
just puts a dark-haired girl
in a red jacket behind the wheel.

234
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:29,795
And that could
still be Sonya.

235
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,756
Well, what about the pictures?
The facial abrasions?

236
00:10:32,897 --> 00:10:34,239
Her arm is clearly
in a sling.

237
00:10:34,412 --> 00:10:37,124
Well, if I were defending her,
I would argue that all of that

238
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:39,476
is consistent with having
been in a car accident.

239
00:10:39,561 --> 00:10:40,819
None of it suggests

240
00:10:40,904 --> 00:10:43,405
in any absolute way
that she was driving.

241
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,337
Danny, you've been to the club.
I have to believe

242
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:47,514
one of the valets saw
who got behind the wheel.

243
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,326
Well, not that they'll admit to.

244
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:51,186
In fact, none of them
even remember

245
00:10:51,271 --> 00:10:52,882
bringing the Lamborghini
around.

246
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:54,640
Come on.
A sweet car like that?

247
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:57,937
Oh, yeah. I suspect
that no one's gonna remember,

248
00:10:58,022 --> 00:11:00,046
'cause they know
they could be liable

249
00:11:00,131 --> 00:11:02,136
for letting a drunk driver
get behind the wheel.

250
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:05,444
Not to mention
both girls were under 21,

251
00:11:05,584 --> 00:11:07,838
and they allowed them
inside to drink.

252
00:11:08,021 --> 00:11:10,593
Well, I'll keep looking
for other possible witnesses.

253
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:11,843
Perhaps somebody
who was partying there

254
00:11:11,927 --> 00:11:13,304
that night saw something.

255
00:11:13,451 --> 00:11:15,149
Let's not forget,
there are traffic cameras

256
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:18,077
and security cameras
all over Manhattan.

257
00:11:18,162 --> 00:11:21,358
Maybe one of them captured
an image of Jade driving.

258
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:22,934
I wouldn't be so sure.

259
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:25,459
I've found dozens of images
of the Lamborghini,

260
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,312
and the windows
are tinted so dark,

261
00:11:27,397 --> 00:11:28,912
you can't make out the driver.

262
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,600
None of this sounds
very promising, does it?

263
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:35,909
Really? I don't know,
I'm kind of encouraged.

264
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:37,520
Let's let Benny

265
00:11:37,604 --> 00:11:39,522
file some papers
tomorrow morning and see

266
00:11:39,606 --> 00:11:41,710
where that leaves us
before we gather up our towels

267
00:11:41,795 --> 00:11:43,436
and throw them in.

268
00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:52,591
Mauricio wanted
to sleep at his dad's.

269
00:11:52,975 --> 00:11:55,230
He said it was
just too sad here.

270
00:12:11,405 --> 00:12:12,959
You call home?

271
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,069
Yeah, I wanted
to get my homework.

272
00:12:18,358 --> 00:12:19,646
And, um...

273
00:12:21,217 --> 00:12:23,483
...people keep asking
about the funeral.

274
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:25,437
Working on it.

275
00:12:25,888 --> 00:12:27,897
Working on lots of things.

276
00:12:28,741 --> 00:12:31,224
I think we're actually gonna
be able to go to court.

277
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:34,881
Make the woman who did this
take responsibility for it.

278
00:12:35,225 --> 00:12:37,057
And it will be you that's suing.

279
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:39,189
She'll have to answer to you.

280
00:12:40,123 --> 00:12:41,576
Okay.

281
00:12:42,217 --> 00:12:43,460
And there's some other thing

282
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:45,367
that I've been meaning
to talk to you about.

283
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:51,912
You know, your mom,

284
00:12:52,561 --> 00:12:55,608
she was pretty smart, Henry.

285
00:12:56,412 --> 00:12:58,097
She really tried to

286
00:12:58,841 --> 00:13:01,820
think of everything
when it came to you.

287
00:13:02,162 --> 00:13:04,881
Even something as
tragic as this.

288
00:13:06,022 --> 00:13:09,303
And she decided,
if something happened

289
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:13,740
and she couldn't take care of you,
she wanted me to do it.

290
00:13:14,702 --> 00:13:16,389
To be your guardian.

291
00:13:18,248 --> 00:13:21,178
I don't understand.
You'd move to Denver?

292
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,053
Probably not.
I mean, I don't know.

293
00:13:27,381 --> 00:13:29,225
I suppose
anything is possible.

294
00:13:30,325 --> 00:13:33,548
You know, when your mom
figured all these things out,

295
00:13:33,632 --> 00:13:35,373
I didn't live in New York.

296
00:13:36,186 --> 00:13:38,205
I didn't have a little boy.

297
00:13:39,014 --> 00:13:40,545
You weren't 12.

298
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:47,186
The answer is,
I don't know... yet.

299
00:13:48,866 --> 00:13:51,147
Whatever turns out
being best for you,

300
00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:53,444
that's the answer.

301
00:13:56,686 --> 00:13:58,095
So, who'd you call?

302
00:13:58,427 --> 00:14:00,201
My friend Toby.

303
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:03,749
And, by the way,
he said his parents said

304
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:04,971
I could live with him.

305
00:14:05,388 --> 00:14:08,408
I mean, if you didn't
move to Denver.

306
00:14:08,865 --> 00:14:11,187
Well, that's good.
That's nice.

307
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:12,787
Options.

308
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:15,011
It's always good
to have options.

309
00:14:17,696 --> 00:14:19,076
Hug?

310
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:25,209
And thus it begins.

311
00:14:25,294 --> 00:14:26,858
Let's talk jury.

312
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:28,256
Hmm.

313
00:14:29,052 --> 00:14:31,538
Well, we know the defense
is gonna make the jury aware

314
00:14:31,623 --> 00:14:32,968
of Sonya's confession.

315
00:14:33,053 --> 00:14:36,335
Either in their opening statement
or through testimony.

316
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,749
So we need to try
and identify people who will be able

317
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:42,792
to see that confession
for what it is:

318
00:14:42,991 --> 00:14:45,069
the ultimate act of privilege.

319
00:14:45,154 --> 00:14:48,835
One spoiled kid lending another
her "get out of jail free" card

320
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,014
like it's a pair of Louboutins.

321
00:14:57,408 --> 00:14:59,410
Oh, boy.

322
00:15:06,693 --> 00:15:08,959
Prospective jurors,

323
00:15:09,717 --> 00:15:13,257
now, this trial is likely
to last into next week.

324
00:15:13,341 --> 00:15:15,825
So, please raise your hand

325
00:15:15,909 --> 00:15:19,173
if serving as a juror would be
a legitimate hardship for you.

326
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:22,310
You, sir, in the front row,

327
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,120
please state the reason
for your hardship.

328
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:25,648
I don't want to jinx anything,

329
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:27,827
but that seemed to me to go
pretty well. Am I wrong?

330
00:15:27,912 --> 00:15:29,804
Nope. I'm pretty pleased
with our jury.

331
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:31,275
Nice work, gentlemen.

332
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:32,702
Not that I'd expect any less

333
00:15:32,787 --> 00:15:35,061
from the best jury whisperers
in New York.

334
00:15:35,358 --> 00:15:37,455
He's being nice.
He must want something.

335
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:39,522
Just to express my admiration.

336
00:15:40,368 --> 00:15:44,070
Your strategy was very clear
and very smart.

337
00:15:44,412 --> 00:15:47,445
Capitalize on our country's
growing animosity

338
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,843
toward the rich and privileged.

339
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:51,556
I guess we'll all find out
together if it works.

340
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,254
To that end, while my client
Ms. Bennington

341
00:15:54,338 --> 00:15:56,406
is completely innocent
in this matter,

342
00:15:56,491 --> 00:15:58,008
her parents are convinced
that this case

343
00:15:58,092 --> 00:15:59,913
will turn her
into a national scapegoat

344
00:15:59,998 --> 00:16:01,859
for all the pent-up rage
toward the rich.

345
00:16:01,944 --> 00:16:06,281
So, they've asked me
to offer $250,000 to end this

346
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:09,070
before subjecting her to
a grueling public trial.

347
00:16:09,155 --> 00:16:11,968
With no acknowledgment
of fault, of course.

348
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:13,883
But she was at fault.

349
00:16:14,092 --> 00:16:17,553
If the Benningtonsare
offering $250,000 to start,

350
00:16:17,655 --> 00:16:20,016
I'm guessing there's more
on the table?

351
00:16:21,787 --> 00:16:23,370
I'm sure I can find
some wiggle room

352
00:16:23,454 --> 00:16:25,748
if you hit me
with a reasonable counter.

353
00:16:25,873 --> 00:16:28,756
Can you give us till after lunch
to confer with our client?

354
00:16:37,795 --> 00:16:40,795
Okay. Now you may speak.

355
00:16:41,592 --> 00:16:44,957
Jade's parents can't just pay
to make this go away.

356
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,585
Do they really think
they can put a dollar figure

357
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,005
on Caroline's life?

358
00:16:49,444 --> 00:16:51,827
You do realize that's
exactly what we're doing

359
00:16:51,912 --> 00:16:53,313
with this lawsuit?

360
00:16:53,561 --> 00:16:56,248
This is a civil
suit, not criminal.

361
00:16:56,358 --> 00:16:58,362
At the end of the day,
it's all about the money.

362
00:16:58,446 --> 00:17:01,321
No. If that girl isn't
willing to admit fault,

363
00:17:01,405 --> 00:17:03,446
there's no amount of money
that can make this right.

364
00:17:04,842 --> 00:17:06,584
It's a lot of money, Taylor.

365
00:17:06,866 --> 00:17:10,504
It can go towards
Henry's future, his college.

366
00:17:10,639 --> 00:17:11,811
Still.

367
00:17:12,249 --> 00:17:14,624
I'm gonna say something
I know you don't want to hear,

368
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:15,912
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

369
00:17:16,724 --> 00:17:19,608
I'm worried that
even if we win this lawsuit,

370
00:17:20,017 --> 00:17:22,544
it's not gonna give you
what you're looking for.

371
00:17:22,912 --> 00:17:24,662
You know what
I'm looking for?

372
00:17:25,908 --> 00:17:29,998
I want that girl to have
to sit in a courtroom

373
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,834
and hear about the woman
whose life she took.

374
00:17:33,326 --> 00:17:34,899
I don't want her to be able
to buy her way out of that.

375
00:17:34,983 --> 00:17:37,123
Because no matter
what happens, win or lose,

376
00:17:37,506 --> 00:17:39,881
she's gonna have to live
with what she's done.

377
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:43,755
And when she thinks about it,
I want her to be able

378
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:48,325
to put a face on the person
whose life she stole.

379
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:52,111
I want her to know
that Caroline mattered.

380
00:17:52,623 --> 00:17:57,943
That the world was a
better place for her being here.

381
00:17:58,027 --> 00:18:01,512
And a lesser place
now that she's gone.

382
00:18:01,936 --> 00:18:04,425
That's what I want.

383
00:18:08,777 --> 00:18:10,498
Understood.

384
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:14,359
I will let opposing counsel
know that we are not interested

385
00:18:14,444 --> 00:18:16,815
in a settlement
at this time,

386
00:18:17,287 --> 00:18:19,944
we very much look forward
to our day in court.

387
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,975
Thank you.

388
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:28,342
Good morning, Mr. Silver.
Now can you please

389
00:18:28,522 --> 00:18:30,854
tell the court what it
is you do for a living?

390
00:18:30,938 --> 00:18:32,856
- I'm an influencer.
- Ah.

391
00:18:33,194 --> 00:18:35,946
And for those of us
who might not be familiar,

392
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,557
can you explain
what an influencer does?

393
00:18:38,866 --> 00:18:41,865
Brands hire me to promote
their products on social media.

394
00:18:42,116 --> 00:18:45,280
I mostly do fashion but some
restaurants and clubs, too.

395
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:48,366
I wear the clothes, go to the clubs,
and then post about it

396
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:50,413
on the different
social media platforms.

397
00:18:50,745 --> 00:18:54,317
And-and how do you know
the defendant Jade Bennington?

398
00:18:54,998 --> 00:18:57,475
One of the clubs I post for,
The Burrow,

399
00:18:57,756 --> 00:18:58,999
I see her there a lot.

400
00:18:59,084 --> 00:19:00,148
Huh.

401
00:19:00,233 --> 00:19:02,451
But Ms. Bennington
is only 18 years old,

402
00:19:02,535 --> 00:19:04,540
and these clubs serve alcohol.

403
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:07,108
Have any idea
how she gets into them?

404
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,761
I have no idea at all.

405
00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:11,547
I guess you'd have
to ask her about that.

406
00:19:11,764 --> 00:19:15,943
Now, did you happen to see
Jade Bennington at The Burrow

407
00:19:16,027 --> 00:19:17,727
on the evening of March 4?

408
00:19:18,201 --> 00:19:20,428
Yes. We were both
in the VIP lounge that night.

409
00:19:20,513 --> 00:19:22,256
And was Jade with anyone?

410
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:24,889
Yes. She was with her friend
Sonya Waliczek.

411
00:19:24,981 --> 00:19:29,520
And do you have any idea
how Jade and Sonya got to the club?

412
00:19:29,605 --> 00:19:31,480
I-I mean, their mode
of transportation?

413
00:19:31,616 --> 00:19:34,700
I saw them pull up
in Sonya's Lamborghini Urus.

414
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,007
Oh, I see.
So they drove themselves.

415
00:19:37,091 --> 00:19:38,326
And, uh,

416
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:39,836
did you happen to see

417
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,752
if either of the girls
consumed alcohol that night?

418
00:19:43,147 --> 00:19:45,576
Yes. I believe
both girls were drinking.

419
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:49,411
All right, now,
so l-let's talk about Sonya first.

420
00:19:49,584 --> 00:19:51,171
How would you describe
her condition?

421
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:54,720
Would, would you say
that Sonya was a little tipsy,

422
00:19:54,804 --> 00:19:57,506
or would you describe her
as inebriated?

423
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:01,466
Um, I believe she was...
I couldn't really say.

424
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:04,209
It's not like I administered
a blood alcohol test or anything.

425
00:20:04,294 --> 00:20:06,851
Yeah, but I'm sure
you witnessed her demeanor.

426
00:20:06,936 --> 00:20:10,264
Was she slurring her words?
Stumbling around?

427
00:20:10,427 --> 00:20:12,172
Yes. Yes to...?

428
00:20:12,257 --> 00:20:15,412
Both. She was slurring her
word sand stumbling around.

429
00:20:15,497 --> 00:20:19,342
Now, Jade, did she seem
inebriated to you, Mr. Silver?

430
00:20:19,525 --> 00:20:22,400
Was she slurring her words
or stumbling around?

431
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,922
Yes.

432
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:25,748
But she wasn't as
drunk as Sonya.

433
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,578
Aha. Which brings us back

434
00:20:27,663 --> 00:20:29,866
to the Lamborghini,
Sonya's Lamborghini.

435
00:20:29,951 --> 00:20:31,202
You already testified

436
00:20:31,287 --> 00:20:33,912
that she was slurring her
words and stumbling around.

437
00:20:34,006 --> 00:20:36,545
Do you know if she drove home
in that condition?

438
00:20:37,092 --> 00:20:38,808
I doubt it.

439
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:40,636
When the girls were leaving,
I heard Jade

440
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,594
offer to drive Sonya's car
for her.

441
00:20:42,928 --> 00:20:44,226
Objection.

442
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:45,311
Hearsay.

443
00:20:45,396 --> 00:20:48,234
Counsel knows full well
that the witness is sharing

444
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:50,820
a statement that indicates
the accused

445
00:20:50,904 --> 00:20:53,171
was contemplating
breaking the law.

446
00:20:53,256 --> 00:20:54,650
It's a statement against

447
00:20:54,734 --> 00:20:55,991
penal interest,
Your Honor,

448
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,403
which is not subject to
the hearsay objection.

449
00:20:58,733 --> 00:21:00,134
I'll allow it.

450
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:02,177
I have no further questions.

451
00:21:04,459 --> 00:21:08,390
So, Mr. Silver, did you
actually see Ms. Bennington

452
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,753
get behind the wheel
of that Lamborghini?

453
00:21:10,951 --> 00:21:12,494
No, I did not.

454
00:21:12,578 --> 00:21:13,866
Hmm.

455
00:21:13,951 --> 00:21:16,381
So you really don't know
who ended up driving

456
00:21:16,491 --> 00:21:18,405
Sonya Sidewalk’s car that night, do you?

457
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:19,892
No, I do not.

458
00:21:20,717 --> 00:21:22,187
I have no further questions

459
00:21:22,272 --> 00:21:23,766
for this witness, Your Honor.

460
00:21:24,287 --> 00:21:25,609
They still with us?

461
00:21:25,694 --> 00:21:27,616
Well, we've planted
a seed of doubt.

462
00:21:27,709 --> 00:21:30,826
Whether it actually takes root
and grows or not,

463
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:32,866
that's gonna be up to you.

464
00:21:34,701 --> 00:21:36,109
Ready for witness prep?

465
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:37,432
Just about.

466
00:21:37,516 --> 00:21:38,737
What you got there?

467
00:21:38,821 --> 00:21:40,623
Opposition research.

468
00:21:40,795 --> 00:21:42,451
On myself.

469
00:21:43,295 --> 00:21:45,959
I don't want to be blindsided
by anything on cross.

470
00:21:48,889 --> 00:21:53,179
You have $61,372
in credit card debt?

471
00:21:53,264 --> 00:21:54,616
Girl, what are you doing?

472
00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:56,304
Getting takeout
from Jean-Georges?

473
00:21:56,389 --> 00:21:57,800
I know.
I'm in way over my head.

474
00:21:57,884 --> 00:21:59,030
But I got divorced.

475
00:21:59,115 --> 00:22:01,116
I had to find
and furnish my own place.

476
00:22:01,235 --> 00:22:03,273
Plus, I've been taking care
of my sister's family

477
00:22:03,358 --> 00:22:05,161
since her husband lost his job

478
00:22:05,246 --> 00:22:06,162
- last year and...
- Okay.

479
00:22:06,247 --> 00:22:07,774
You don't have to
explain yourself to me.

480
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:11,030
But this is definitely something
that the other side could use.

481
00:22:12,061 --> 00:22:13,424
I had a hunch.

482
00:22:13,592 --> 00:22:15,644
That's why I put it
in the binder for you.

483
00:22:16,287 --> 00:22:19,874
You were named as trustee
in Caroline's will, right?

484
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:21,432
Not just guardian?

485
00:22:21,654 --> 00:22:23,850
Which means that
you control any money

486
00:22:23,936 --> 00:22:25,654
that Henry would win
from this lawsuit,

487
00:22:25,738 --> 00:22:27,612
whether he lives
with you or not.

488
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,475
I think that's how it works.

489
00:22:30,647 --> 00:22:33,046
I'm just worried the other side
will use Taylor's debt

490
00:22:33,131 --> 00:22:34,350
to paint her
as desperate.

491
00:22:34,435 --> 00:22:36,124
Someone who would trump up
a false claim

492
00:22:36,209 --> 00:22:38,101
to solve her own
financial problems.

493
00:22:38,405 --> 00:22:39,494
Don't worry.

494
00:22:39,578 --> 00:22:41,373
We just need to get out
in front of it.

495
00:22:41,701 --> 00:22:44,412
We just need to be the ones who
tell the jury about it first.

496
00:22:44,576 --> 00:22:45,891
But surely,

497
00:22:45,975 --> 00:22:48,342
if you receive money
for this lawsuit,

498
00:22:48,537 --> 00:22:51,201
it will make your life
a lot easier, won't it?

499
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,768
I don't see how.

500
00:22:52,852 --> 00:22:54,900
I certainly don't think
it should.

501
00:22:54,984 --> 00:22:56,728
That money would be
for Henry.

502
00:22:57,162 --> 00:23:00,187
To feed him and clothe him
and educate him.

503
00:23:00,272 --> 00:23:03,287
Health care and
college and...

504
00:23:04,295 --> 00:23:06,173
He's a 12-year-old boy.

505
00:23:06,905 --> 00:23:08,740
Without a mom or a dad.

506
00:23:08,824 --> 00:23:14,155
So, even if all of those thingsl
just listed are provided for,

507
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,499
he's still got
an enormous hill to climb.

508
00:23:16,584 --> 00:23:20,272
And I know everybody's mother
is irreplaceable.

509
00:23:21,381 --> 00:23:23,076
But this boy didn't get

510
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:27,170
25 or 35 or 45 years with her.

511
00:23:27,795 --> 00:23:29,381
He got 12.

512
00:23:30,436 --> 00:23:32,389
And I don't know
what to tell him.

513
00:23:33,068 --> 00:23:34,241
I don't know what to say.

514
00:23:34,326 --> 00:23:37,855
I cannot come up with the
words to make him understand

515
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,599
that despite all of the evidence
that's been thrown his way

516
00:23:41,683 --> 00:23:44,444
these past few weeks,
that the world is a good place.

517
00:23:45,186 --> 00:23:47,301
That the world isn’t horrible.

518
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:51,914
Not when his amazing, kind

519
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:54,830
and beautiful mother
is run down in the street.

520
00:23:55,138 --> 00:23:58,608
And no one even bothers
to say they're sorry.

521
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:01,928
Thank you.

522
00:24:02,131 --> 00:24:04,303
No further questions at this time,
Your Honor.

523
00:24:07,092 --> 00:24:08,452
Are they with us yet?

524
00:24:08,787 --> 00:24:10,803
Not a one of them.

525
00:24:11,341 --> 00:24:12,429
I don't understand.

526
00:24:12,514 --> 00:24:14,053
How can the jury
not be moved by that?

527
00:24:14,194 --> 00:24:15,491
Because we still haven't proven

528
00:24:15,576 --> 00:24:17,022
that Sonya wasn't
driving the car.

529
00:24:17,107 --> 00:24:19,635
And at the end of the day,
that's all that matters.

530
00:24:20,842 --> 00:24:23,641
That was very moving testimony,
Ms. Rentzel.

531
00:24:25,123 --> 00:24:26,772
But then,
I'm guessing you know

532
00:24:26,857 --> 00:24:29,561
a little something about
the art of testifying, don't you?

533
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,873
Would you mind telling
the jury who you work for?

534
00:24:32,989 --> 00:24:35,169
I don't like where
this is headed.

535
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:38,003
I work for the
Trial Analysis Corporation.

536
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:39,831
Of course.

537
00:24:39,991 --> 00:24:42,506
And the Trial Analysis
Corporation

538
00:24:42,591 --> 00:24:45,140
is run by Dr. Jason Bull,
isn't it?

539
00:24:45,631 --> 00:24:46,708
Yes.

540
00:24:46,792 --> 00:24:49,145
And he's sitting right there,
isn't he?

541
00:24:49,592 --> 00:24:51,365
Yes. And Dr. Bull

542
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:53,192
is considered one of the best
jury consultants

543
00:24:53,276 --> 00:24:55,282
in the country,
isn't that right?

544
00:24:56,248 --> 00:24:59,187
He prefers the term
trial scientist.

545
00:24:59,272 --> 00:25:02,289
But, yes,
he's very well regarded.

546
00:25:03,147 --> 00:25:05,988
Sorry, trial scientist.

547
00:25:06,568 --> 00:25:08,308
Now, isn't it true
that your job,

548
00:25:08,811 --> 00:25:11,036
the job of the entire company,

549
00:25:11,655 --> 00:25:14,257
is to manipulate juries
so that your clients

550
00:25:14,341 --> 00:25:16,787
win favorable outcomes
in matters before the courts?

551
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:19,756
Well, no.
We don't manipulate anyone.

552
00:25:19,965 --> 00:25:24,132
We assist in jury selection,
research trial strategies.

553
00:25:24,217 --> 00:25:27,001
Our in-house attorney
will often represent clients.

554
00:25:27,093 --> 00:25:29,620
Basically, we try to add science

555
00:25:29,741 --> 00:25:32,884
and an understanding of human
behavior into the trial process

556
00:25:32,968 --> 00:25:35,887
in ways that help lawyers
assist their clients.

557
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:39,369
Do you deny that the company
you work for has a team of people

558
00:25:39,453 --> 00:25:44,608
using highly advanced algorithms
and invasive personal data

559
00:25:44,693 --> 00:25:46,484
about potential jurors to help

560
00:25:46,569 --> 00:25:49,354
attorneys and clients
zero in on those

561
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:51,401
most likely to vote
in their favor?

562
00:25:51,596 --> 00:25:54,366
No. I don't deny
any of that at all.

563
00:25:54,451 --> 00:25:56,592
But I do deny
that it's manipulation

564
00:25:56,677 --> 00:25:58,811
or that it's in any way
deceitful.

565
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,889
Since when is being smarter
than the other guy deceitful?

566
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:05,623
And isn't it true that
you rehearse witnesses?

567
00:26:06,325 --> 00:26:08,049
Test certain pieces

568
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:11,936
of testimony to see which
lines are most effective.

569
00:26:12,834 --> 00:26:16,701
Which answers elicit
which emotions

570
00:26:16,944 --> 00:26:19,022
from which jurors?

571
00:26:23,062 --> 00:26:25,069
The witness will answer
the question.

572
00:26:26,857 --> 00:26:28,342
Yes.

573
00:26:28,435 --> 00:26:31,084
It's a technique employed
by many attorneys

574
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,550
all over the world.

575
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,648
And how long did it
take you and your team

576
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:46,248
to write and test that answer
to your attorney's question

577
00:26:46,428 --> 00:26:48,873
about whether or not any
money you illegally wrest

578
00:26:48,957 --> 00:26:50,233
- from my client...
- Objection!

579
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:52,125
...will improve your life?
The attorney is testifying

580
00:26:52,209 --> 00:26:53,850
and being misleading,

581
00:26:53,936 --> 00:26:55,837
not to mention
badgering the witness

582
00:26:55,921 --> 00:26:57,866
and citing facts
not in evidence.

583
00:26:57,951 --> 00:26:59,390
That's not how it works.

584
00:26:59,475 --> 00:27:00,755
Everything I said,
those were my words. - Order!

585
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:02,420
My feelings. Order!

586
00:27:02,505 --> 00:27:04,728
Objection sustained.

587
00:27:05,017 --> 00:27:07,413
Jury will disregard counsel's
last question

588
00:27:07,498 --> 00:27:09,241
and the witness's answer.

589
00:27:09,647 --> 00:27:11,766
Sorry for overstepping,
Your Honor.

590
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:14,900
I have no further
questions at this time.

591
00:27:18,934 --> 00:27:20,469
Thank you for coming over 
so late.

592
00:27:20,554 --> 00:27:22,125
I'd have come to you,
but the boys are both asleep.

593
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:24,605
I totally understand.
I'm sure you're upset.

594
00:27:24,689 --> 00:27:26,998
- That last round of testimony...
- I actually don't care.

595
00:27:27,475 --> 00:27:29,990
Excuse me? I found something
that makes it all moot.

596
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:33,701
So, when the case started,

597
00:27:33,881 --> 00:27:36,014
someone who
shall not be named

598
00:27:36,209 --> 00:27:37,705
hacked into
Jade Bennington's cell phone

599
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,952
and started recording
all of her conversations.

600
00:27:40,037 --> 00:27:41,218
Oh, my God.
Taylor?

601
00:27:41,303 --> 00:27:44,007
Now, before you lecture me
on how I've crossed the line,

602
00:27:44,092 --> 00:27:45,582
just listen
to what I found.

603
00:27:46,366 --> 00:27:48,843
Now, I've captured hours
and hours of recordings

604
00:27:48,928 --> 00:27:50,588
and I haven't been able
to listen to it all,

605
00:27:50,672 --> 00:27:53,476
but I set up a keyword alert
to help me sift through it all.

606
00:27:53,561 --> 00:27:55,549
And tonight
I finally struck gold.

607
00:27:56,318 --> 00:27:58,164
You're not going to flake
on me in court tomorrow,

608
00:27:58,248 --> 00:27:59,320
are you?

609
00:27:59,405 --> 00:28:00,678
That's Jade Bennington.

610
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:02,428
I said I'd be there,

611
00:28:02,513 --> 00:28:03,921
and I'll be there.

612
00:28:04,006 --> 00:28:06,373
And that's Sonya Waliczek,
the ambassador's daughter.

613
00:28:07,162 --> 00:28:10,101
My lawyer said that
lady's attorney is super tough.

614
00:28:10,186 --> 00:28:12,234
That he's going to try
to get us to crack.

615
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:14,460
You can't admit
that I was driving.

616
00:28:14,545 --> 00:28:16,295
Come on. I'm not stupid.

617
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,744
But he might try to trick you.

618
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:19,703
Jade, listen to me.

619
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,498
I've got you.

620
00:28:22,561 --> 00:28:24,406
There it is.
This proves it.

621
00:28:24,491 --> 00:28:25,562
Jade was driving.

622
00:28:25,647 --> 00:28:27,514
Uh, yeah, it does.

623
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:29,496
But you know we
can't use it.

624
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:31,765
The judge will never
allow it into evidence.

625
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,038
It's an illegal recording.

626
00:28:33,123 --> 00:28:35,187
I know that. But I was
thinking maybe I'd post it

627
00:28:35,272 --> 00:28:37,156
on Jade's "rich kids of whatever" account.

628
00:28:37,241 --> 00:28:39,078
At least that way,
the world will know the truth.

629
00:28:39,162 --> 00:28:40,115
Even if the jury doesn't.

630
00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:43,062
No, you can't. You cannot,
under any circumstances,

631
00:28:43,147 --> 00:28:45,599
post this recording online
or anywhere else.

632
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,178
You were eaves
dropping on a diplomat's family.

633
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,725
Do you understand how
big of a deal that is?

634
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:54,499
They will send you to prison
if they find out you posted it.

635
00:28:54,584 --> 00:28:55,671
And they will find out.

636
00:28:55,756 --> 00:28:56,679
You don't know that.

637
00:28:56,764 --> 00:28:58,783
No. I do know that.

638
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,795
Taylor, these are
powerful people.

639
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,923
And do you really
think that

640
00:29:06,007 --> 00:29:08,365
this is what Caroline
wants you to do?

641
00:29:08,739 --> 00:29:10,678
Who is gonna look
out for Henry?

642
00:29:12,373 --> 00:29:14,664
Who is gonna look
out for Mauricio?

643
00:29:15,715 --> 00:29:17,396
Now give it to me.

644
00:29:17,678 --> 00:29:19,489
Give what to you?
The laptop.

645
00:29:19,654 --> 00:29:21,092
Why?

646
00:29:21,584 --> 00:29:23,332
So you don't do
anything stupid.

647
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,179
You'll get this back
when the trial is over.

648
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,486
Until then, you can borrow
one of the company's.

649
00:29:28,114 --> 00:29:29,378
I hate you.

650
00:29:29,494 --> 00:29:32,716
I know.
I hate you, too.

651
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,006
Good luck in court tomorrow.

652
00:29:36,709 --> 00:29:37,952
I'm gonna need it.

653
00:29:46,123 --> 00:29:47,867
Please state your name
for the record.

654
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:49,217
Sonya Waliczek.

655
00:29:50,648 --> 00:29:51,967
Ms. Waliczek,

656
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:57,443
on the night of March 4,
were you involved in a car accident?

657
00:29:58,631 --> 00:29:59,850
I was.

658
00:30:00,005 --> 00:30:02,021
Can you please tell the court
what happened?

659
00:30:03,592 --> 00:30:05,396
I was out with a friend.

660
00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:08,413
And when I was driving us home
at the end of the night,

661
00:30:08,498 --> 00:30:09,976
I thought
I could make a light.

662
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,818
So I sped up.

663
00:30:12,771 --> 00:30:15,457
But right when I went through
the light, this woman...

664
00:30:18,657 --> 00:30:20,224
Do you need a moment?

665
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,717
This woman was crossing
the street.

666
00:30:24,068 --> 00:30:26,639
So I slammed on the brakes,
but...

667
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,576
she just...

668
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,520
I hit her.

669
00:30:35,302 --> 00:30:38,615
And after you struck
Ms. Collins,

670
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:40,748
then what happened?

671
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,068
I drove away.

672
00:30:47,893 --> 00:30:50,553
And your friend, the defendant,
Jade Bennington,

673
00:30:51,498 --> 00:30:53,420
was she in the car
with you that night?

674
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:55,804
Yes, she was.

675
00:30:55,888 --> 00:30:58,503
But just to be clear,
who was driving?

676
00:30:59,752 --> 00:31:01,104
I was.

677
00:31:02,947 --> 00:31:04,619
I have no further questions,
Your Honor.

678
00:31:09,251 --> 00:31:10,905
Good morning, Ms. Waliczek.

679
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,386
Here's a question
for you.

680
00:31:12,885 --> 00:31:15,258
Do you understand that if
Jade Bennington had been

681
00:31:15,342 --> 00:31:17,783
driving the car that struck
and killed Ms. Collins,

682
00:31:18,026 --> 00:31:20,263
she could be
prosecuted criminally?

683
00:31:20,604 --> 00:31:21,666
Yes.

684
00:31:21,751 --> 00:31:23,520
But you already confessed
to driving the car

685
00:31:23,612 --> 00:31:25,399
that struck and killed
Ms. Collins.

686
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,488
So why aren't you
being prosecuted?

687
00:31:27,729 --> 00:31:29,359
My father is an ambassador.

688
00:31:29,823 --> 00:31:31,884
I have diplomatic immunity.

689
00:31:32,775 --> 00:31:34,604
And isn't it true that

690
00:31:34,838 --> 00:31:36,845
diplomatic immunity
also protects you

691
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:38,783
from being sued
in civil court?

692
00:31:38,979 --> 00:31:40,283
That's my understanding.

693
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,745
So, in truth,

694
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:44,853
you risk nothing
by confessing to this crime.

695
00:31:44,937 --> 00:31:46,159
Do you, Ms. Waliczek?

696
00:31:46,243 --> 00:31:48,417
Objection.
Asked and answered.

697
00:31:48,502 --> 00:31:50,565
I think Mr. Colón has made his point,
Your Honor.

698
00:31:50,901 --> 00:31:52,987
I disagree. Overruled.

699
00:31:54,104 --> 00:31:56,035
The witness will answer
the question.

700
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,901
I'm sorry.
What was the question?

701
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:05,015
Well, I was asking if you risk
anything by confessing

702
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:09,093
to striking Ms. Collins
with your Lamborghini Urus,

703
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:11,826
killing her, and then leaving
the scene of the crime.

704
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:14,133
No.

705
00:32:14,513 --> 00:32:16,109
I mean, because isn't that
the reason why

706
00:32:16,193 --> 00:32:18,033
you're confessing
to a crime you didn't commit?

707
00:32:18,512 --> 00:32:19,905
Because Jade Bennington

708
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,020
is your best friend,

709
00:32:21,104 --> 00:32:22,587
and she could be
sent to prison

710
00:32:22,672 --> 00:32:25,373
for killing Ms. Collins,
but you can't?

711
00:32:26,615 --> 00:32:28,382
Do you honestly think
I'd admit

712
00:32:28,467 --> 00:32:30,333
to killing someone
if I didn't do it?

713
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:33,632
That I'd go through my entire
life letting the world think

714
00:32:33,717 --> 00:32:35,506
I was a murderer when I wasn't?

715
00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:38,820
Do you know what this
has done to my family?

716
00:32:39,231 --> 00:32:42,788
My father, a man
who's spent his entire life

717
00:32:42,873 --> 00:32:45,305
earning the confidence
and trust of his government,

718
00:32:45,537 --> 00:32:47,263
spent the last ten years earning

719
00:32:47,347 --> 00:32:50,049
the confidence and trust
of your government,

720
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,413
knowing that people think his
daughter is just some spoiled,

721
00:32:54,498 --> 00:32:55,837
irresponsible party girl

722
00:32:55,921 --> 00:32:58,787
that killed someone
and is gonna get away with it?

723
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:05,636
Talk about a well-written, well-rehearsed

724
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,290
piece of testimony.

725
00:33:07,435 --> 00:33:08,700
Look at 'em.

726
00:33:09,295 --> 00:33:11,193
They're completely buying
what she's selling.

727
00:33:14,461 --> 00:33:16,443
Sure. But what's in it for me?

728
00:33:16,818 --> 00:33:18,467
What do you mean?

729
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:20,819
So you're saying the woman's
voice is Jade's?

730
00:33:20,903 --> 00:33:22,037
Exactly.

731
00:33:22,121 --> 00:33:23,822
Turns out Taylor's
been secretly recording

732
00:33:23,906 --> 00:33:25,432
all of Jade's
cell phone conversations.

733
00:33:25,516 --> 00:33:28,779
Excuse me?
You know that's against the law.

734
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,311
I went through
all that with her,

735
00:33:30,396 --> 00:33:32,831
even made her
give me her laptop.

736
00:33:32,998 --> 00:33:35,442
But then I found myself going
through everything

737
00:33:35,526 --> 00:33:38,401
to see if there might be
some bread crumbs

738
00:33:38,485 --> 00:33:41,006
that would lead us to
something we can use legally.

739
00:33:41,091 --> 00:33:42,076
And...?

740
00:33:42,161 --> 00:33:44,513
And I think I found something
Taylor missed.

741
00:33:44,598 --> 00:33:46,201
I don't know
who she's talking to,

742
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:48,237
but it seems
important.

743
00:33:48,521 --> 00:33:49,848
Well, it's a pretty big ask.

744
00:33:50,013 --> 00:33:52,366
I thought I might get a pretty
big thank you in return?

745
00:33:52,451 --> 00:33:54,068
I can show you
what I had in mind

746
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:55,365
if you can come over tonight.

747
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,888
You're disgusting, Geoffrey.

748
00:33:56,973 --> 00:33:58,531
I'm in serious trouble
and I need to know

749
00:33:58,615 --> 00:33:59,803
if you're going
to help me or not.

750
00:33:59,887 --> 00:34:00,756
Of course I'm gonna
help you.

751
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:03,279
I-I was just kidding.
If anyone asks,

752
00:34:03,364 --> 00:34:05,932
I'll swear I never
even saw you that night.

753
00:34:07,768 --> 00:34:09,295
So his first name is Geoffrey.

754
00:34:09,779 --> 00:34:11,478
All right, well,
since she dialed him,

755
00:34:11,562 --> 00:34:12,740
I'll be able to hear the tones

756
00:34:12,824 --> 00:34:14,959
and figure out
the number she was calling.

757
00:34:15,348 --> 00:34:17,693
I should have his last name
in about 20 minutes.

758
00:34:18,003 --> 00:34:19,529
Would you like me
to pay him a visit?

759
00:34:19,613 --> 00:34:21,672
That would be great.
I mean, it sounds from the conversation

760
00:34:21,756 --> 00:34:23,982
that he knows something,
don't you think?

761
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:26,302
Only one way to find out.

762
00:34:32,124 --> 00:34:33,433
Hello.

763
00:34:33,525 --> 00:34:35,474
Hi. Good afternoon.
I was hoping I might be able

764
00:34:35,558 --> 00:34:36,721
to speak with Geoffrey Conover.

765
00:34:36,805 --> 00:34:38,723
May I say who's here
to see Mr. Conover?

766
00:34:38,807 --> 00:34:40,209
I've got this, Paula.

767
00:34:41,716 --> 00:34:43,677
And exactly why do you want
to speak with my son?

768
00:34:43,786 --> 00:34:44,921
My name's Danny James.

769
00:34:45,006 --> 00:34:46,749
I'm an investigator
working for a firm

770
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:49,517
that's handling a lawsuit
against Jade Bennington.

771
00:34:49,646 --> 00:34:51,749
I've been speaking with
all of Jade's friends,

772
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:54,086
and I was hoping
to ask Geoffrey a few questions

773
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:57,092
about a car accident
that Jade was involved in.

774
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,021
No, I'm sorry.
My son's not talking to you.

775
00:35:00,106 --> 00:35:02,576
I can get a subpoena
if you prefer, Mr. Conover.

776
00:35:02,661 --> 00:35:05,388
I'd like you to remove yourself
from my property.

777
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,311
Your Honor, we have reason to
believe that Geoffrey Conover

778
00:35:11,395 --> 00:35:14,271
has highly relevant
and dispositive information

779
00:35:14,355 --> 00:35:15,576
about this case.

780
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,013
Regardless of
what counsel believes,

781
00:35:17,097 --> 00:35:20,190
I have a letter from
Geoffrey's psychiatrist,

782
00:35:20,274 --> 00:35:22,335
and she is quite emphatic
about the fact that Geoffrey

783
00:35:22,419 --> 00:35:25,586
suffers from extreme anxiety,
and that testifying in court

784
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:28,851
would be an undue emotional
hardship for him.

785
00:35:28,935 --> 00:35:33,241
Well, paying a very expensive
lawyer clearly shows

786
00:35:33,326 --> 00:35:35,250
that the Conover family
is interested in making sure

787
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:37,123
that their son
does not testify under oath,

788
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:39,083
- and on that basis alone, I... 
- Dr. Bull,

789
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,326
Mr. Colón...

790
00:35:41,544 --> 00:35:44,616
...on what factual basis
have you come to believe

791
00:35:44,701 --> 00:35:48,513
that Mr. Conover has information
that's relevant to this case?

792
00:35:48,722 --> 00:35:51,444
Well, based on publicly available
social media posts,

793
00:35:51,529 --> 00:35:54,038
it's clear Ms. Bennington and
Mr. Conover have been

794
00:35:54,123 --> 00:35:56,182
in regular contact
since the accident.

795
00:35:56,266 --> 00:35:57,677
Really?

796
00:35:59,013 --> 00:36:02,275
Clearly, Your Honor, this
is a fishing expedition.

797
00:36:02,701 --> 00:36:04,495
I'm inclined to agree.

798
00:36:04,732 --> 00:36:07,411
The fact that two people
have social media postings

799
00:36:07,495 --> 00:36:09,333
that imply a friendship

800
00:36:09,466 --> 00:36:11,834
seems like an awfully thin
premise on which to call

801
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,162
an emotionally fragile
boy to the stand.

802
00:36:15,404 --> 00:36:17,560
I'm granting the motion
to quash your subpoena.

803
00:36:19,246 --> 00:36:21,030
Dr. Bull, Benny...

804
00:36:23,044 --> 00:36:28,013
...thanks for trying
for Caroline and Henry.

805
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,538
Hey, hey.

806
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:33,564
It's not over
until it's over, right?

807
00:36:33,896 --> 00:36:35,655
Well, unfortunately,
unless we can come up

808
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,741
with some concrete new
evidence that puts Jade

809
00:36:37,826 --> 00:36:39,224
in the driver's seat,

810
00:36:40,874 --> 00:36:43,271
I fear Taylor's probably right.

811
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:47,936
You know,
the Conovers' place?

812
00:36:48,021 --> 00:36:49,459
It's covered
in security cameras.

813
00:36:49,544 --> 00:36:51,029
We could subpoena the footage.

814
00:36:51,114 --> 00:36:52,640
And what do you expect to see?

815
00:36:53,356 --> 00:36:55,741
The accident happened
on Sixth Avenue,

816
00:36:55,826 --> 00:36:57,764
and the club they came from
is downtown.

817
00:36:57,849 --> 00:36:59,071
Well, once I realized

818
00:36:59,155 --> 00:37:01,465
that Jade was speaking
to this Conover kid,

819
00:37:01,549 --> 00:37:03,902
I did a little sleuthing
on social media.

820
00:37:04,029 --> 00:37:05,224
You what?

821
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:06,966
And I discovered

822
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,865
he never left
the house that night.

823
00:37:09,949 --> 00:37:11,553
Geoffrey Conover was on Twitch,

824
00:37:11,638 --> 00:37:14,043
live streaming his video
game play the whole time.

825
00:37:14,779 --> 00:37:17,873
So he could not have
been out with Sonya or Jade.

826
00:37:18,005 --> 00:37:20,607
Well, so what is it that Jade
is afraid he'll give up?

827
00:37:20,745 --> 00:37:23,446
Well, whatever it is,
it had to have happened at that house.

828
00:37:23,565 --> 00:37:26,928
And I'm willing to bet
no security camera

829
00:37:27,013 --> 00:37:30,059
is gonna be too emotionally fragile
to share it with us.

830
00:37:30,143 --> 00:37:31,896
So what's
your theory here?

831
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:34,627
Are you saying that after the accident,
maybe the girls

832
00:37:34,712 --> 00:37:36,804
went over to his house and
told him what really happened?

833
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:37,951
None of it
matters.

834
00:37:38,036 --> 00:37:39,428
The court's never gonna
grant a subpoena

835
00:37:39,512 --> 00:37:40,811
on private video footage

836
00:37:40,896 --> 00:37:43,028
without proof
that it will yield fruit.

837
00:37:43,279 --> 00:37:44,900
And the only proof we have

838
00:37:44,984 --> 00:37:47,802
are Taylor's recordings,
which we cannot use.

839
00:37:48,578 --> 00:37:51,842
You know, as wealthy as
the Conovers are, I bet

840
00:37:51,927 --> 00:37:55,163
security cameras aren't the
only things with eyes in that house.

841
00:37:55,412 --> 00:37:56,999
What do you mean?

842
00:37:57,232 --> 00:37:59,584
Well, they had to
have help, right?

843
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:00,944
They're rich people.

844
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,749
They got to have,
like, a houseman

845
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:05,771
or a housekeeper or,
uh, maybe some nannies.

846
00:38:05,856 --> 00:38:08,366
There was a housekeeper.
She answered the door

847
00:38:08,451 --> 00:38:10,273
when I went over
to speak with Geoffrey.

848
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:14,712
Ms. Moyer, thank you
for agreeing to testify today.

849
00:38:15,068 --> 00:38:16,714
Some men came to the door.

850
00:38:16,798 --> 00:38:18,982
They gave me a piece of paper
and said I had no choice.

851
00:38:19,067 --> 00:38:21,169
Yes. We subpoenaed you.

852
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:23,242
Nonetheless,
we're grateful that you're here.

853
00:38:23,537 --> 00:38:26,637
Now, would you mind telling
the court where it is you work?

854
00:38:26,793 --> 00:38:28,639
I work for the Conover family.

855
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:30,263
I'm their live-in housekeeper.

856
00:38:30,348 --> 00:38:32,049
And as their live-in housekeeper,

857
00:38:32,134 --> 00:38:34,896
is it part of your duties to answer
the door for guests?

858
00:38:35,034 --> 00:38:36,037
Yes.

859
00:38:36,138 --> 00:38:37,584
And what happens
at night?

860
00:38:37,669 --> 00:38:39,263
If a guest arrives
after hours?

861
00:38:39,348 --> 00:38:41,041
Maybe when you're
already in bed?

862
00:38:41,126 --> 00:38:43,914
If someone rings the doorbell
or buzzes the gate

863
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:47,266
for the garage at night,
there's an alarm in my quarters.

864
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,312
And why is that?

865
00:38:49,568 --> 00:38:51,280
The Conovers' son Mr. Geoffrey

866
00:38:51,365 --> 00:38:53,349
often forgets his keys
when he goes out.

867
00:38:53,452 --> 00:38:55,091
His parents don't like
to be bothered

868
00:38:55,176 --> 00:38:56,568
after they've gone to bed.

869
00:38:56,653 --> 00:39:00,280
Now on the night of March 4,
the day that Caroline Collins

870
00:39:00,365 --> 00:39:02,796
was struck dead,
you were awakened by someone

871
00:39:02,881 --> 00:39:04,810
buzzing the gate for the garage?

872
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:06,068
Yes.

873
00:39:06,152 --> 00:39:08,545
It was some friends
of Mr. Geoffrey's.

874
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:11,638
They were very upset,
so I buzzed them in

875
00:39:11,722 --> 00:39:14,076
and went down to the garage
to greet them.

876
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,123
Now, Ms. Moyer, what kind of
cardid you buzz into the garage?

877
00:39:20,498 --> 00:39:22,606
It was a black Lamborghini.

878
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:24,568
And did you see

879
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:27,007
who came out of the driver's
side of the car?

880
00:39:27,537 --> 00:39:30,443
Yes. It was her.

881
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,154
$10 million.

882
00:39:59,545 --> 00:40:01,514
I'm not sure I can
even count that high.

883
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,724
Now that you know his
future is financially assured,

884
00:40:05,117 --> 00:40:06,803
where are you
when it comes to Henry?

885
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,139
Deep down, I think
he wants to stay here

886
00:40:10,224 --> 00:40:12,438
for the same reasons
I want him to stay here.

887
00:40:12,678 --> 00:40:15,146
Because we both feel
we owe it to his mom.

888
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:18,264
I'm just not sure
that's the best reason.

889
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:20,490
So what are you gonna do?

890
00:40:20,803 --> 00:40:22,560
He has a best friend
named Toby.

891
00:40:22,847 --> 00:40:24,202
I've been speaking
with his parents.

892
00:40:24,286 --> 00:40:26,321
They're really excited
about the idea

893
00:40:26,406 --> 00:40:28,099
of Henry coming
to live with them.

894
00:40:28,184 --> 00:40:30,493
He'd be in his same school,
near all of his friends.

895
00:40:30,652 --> 00:40:31,787
Oh.

896
00:40:31,933 --> 00:40:33,851
Have you looked
into these people?

897
00:40:35,529 --> 00:40:38,247
I've run more background
checks on them than I did

898
00:40:38,331 --> 00:40:40,376
on any terrorist
while I was at Homeland.

899
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:44,259
But at the end of the day,
I think

900
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:46,029
I have to leave it up to him.

901
00:40:47,615 --> 00:40:49,272
He hasn't chosen
any of the things

902
00:40:49,357 --> 00:40:50,615
that have happened to him.

903
00:40:51,344 --> 00:40:54,560
I think he has the right
to choose where to go next.

904
00:41:00,048 --> 00:41:01,740
There you are.

905
00:41:04,052 --> 00:41:06,011
I could've sworn
I looked under there.

906
00:41:07,099 --> 00:41:10,192
Socks are tricky.
Socks are devious.

907
00:41:10,277 --> 00:41:12,599
You'll start doing your own
laundry, and you'll see.

908
00:41:13,864 --> 00:41:16,748
What happens when
I go back to Denver

909
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:19,521
and I can't find something?

910
00:41:20,283 --> 00:41:22,224
That won't happen.

911
00:41:22,657 --> 00:41:26,256
You've got Toby,
you've got his parents.

912
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:30,974
And if you lose something really
important, you'll call me.

913
00:41:31,274 --> 00:41:33,685
I'll fly out there,
I'll help you look.

914
00:41:38,478 --> 00:41:41,123
You're still going
to the funeral, right?

915
00:41:42,344 --> 00:41:44,999
Weekend after next,
Mauricio and I.

916
00:41:46,954 --> 00:41:48,951
I really miss your mother.

917
00:41:50,544 --> 00:41:51,896
Me, too.

918
00:41:54,321 --> 00:41:55,803
Toby's here.

919
00:41:57,131 --> 00:41:58,718
<i>Hey, Henry.</i>

920
00:41:58,802 --> 00:42:01,209
<i>Henry... it's so good
to see you.</i>

921
00:42:04,669 --> 00:42:06,076
Welcome to New York,

922
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:08,460
Henry's best friend
and his parents.

923
00:42:08,545 --> 00:42:09,984

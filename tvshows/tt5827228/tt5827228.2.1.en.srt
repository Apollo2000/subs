1
00:00:02,247 --> 00:00:03,546
Here in the Big Apple

2
00:00:03,897 --> 00:00:05,263
we love our scandals.

3
00:00:05,697 --> 00:00:07,296
They're the oxygen we breathe.

4
00:00:07,699 --> 00:00:10,155
Like the spring flowers in Central Park,

5
00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:12,254
they bloom across the front pages

6
00:00:12,255 --> 00:00:14,216
of our beloved tabloids.

7
00:00:14,241 --> 00:00:16,121
Whether it's that mayoral candidate

8
00:00:16,122 --> 00:00:17,688
and his sexting,

9
00:00:17,689 --> 00:00:19,521
or that governor and his friend

10
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:21,221
with the perfect lady parts,

11
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:23,088
or our president
and his second wife-to-be

12
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,354
cheating on his first wife,

13
00:00:24,355 --> 00:00:25,954
or his third wife-to-be

14
00:00:25,955 --> 00:00:27,877
cheating on his second wife,

15
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:29,135
it's a scandal

16
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,992
and we love it.

17
00:00:31,017 --> 00:00:34,611
And when the scandal fades, we wilt,

18
00:00:34,611 --> 00:00:37,771
until suddenly, unexpectedly,

19
00:00:38,145 --> 00:00:39,778
a new one comes along.

20
00:00:41,445 --> 00:00:43,577
You tell that Australian son of a bitch

21
00:00:43,578 --> 00:00:46,944
that a billion is as high
as I'm going to go.

22
00:00:46,945 --> 00:00:48,544
And if he wants to find anyone else

23
00:00:48,545 --> 00:00:50,077
who's willing to buy his newspapers

24
00:00:50,078 --> 00:00:51,610
and television stations for more,

25
00:00:51,611 --> 00:00:54,310
he should go ahead and make the deal.

26
00:00:54,311 --> 00:00:56,044
But he'd better make it fast,

27
00:00:56,045 --> 00:00:59,410
because my offer is only good
for 12 more hours.

28
00:01:05,111 --> 00:01:06,377
You're still up?

29
00:01:07,342 --> 00:01:08,644
I told you,

30
00:01:08,645 --> 00:01:12,377
there's nothing else
to discuss, darling.

31
00:01:12,378 --> 00:01:14,577
I'm not about to renegotiate our prenup.

32
00:01:14,578 --> 00:01:16,477
We've been married for five years.

33
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,344
People don't renegotiate their
prenups after they're married.

34
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:21,245
That's why it's called "prenup."

35
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:24,677
Well...

36
00:01:24,678 --> 00:01:28,277
I would hope, after
all these years together,

37
00:01:28,278 --> 00:01:29,777
you'd see that I'm worth far more

38
00:01:29,778 --> 00:01:31,444
than you originally thought.

39
00:01:31,445 --> 00:01:33,244
I'm sorry, dearest, but I believe

40
00:01:33,245 --> 00:01:37,177
that the agreement we reached
before we wed was very generous.

41
00:01:37,178 --> 00:01:38,941
And I still believe that.

42
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:41,254
Look at it from my side.

43
00:01:41,678 --> 00:01:46,544
Each day that goes by is less
and less kind to your beauty.

44
00:01:46,545 --> 00:01:49,910
And I haven't asked to renegotiate.

45
00:01:49,911 --> 00:01:51,261
Have I?

46
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:53,231
No.

47

Oh, my God.

49
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:13,610
Kara, my darling!

50
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:14,778
What did you do?

51
00:02:18,078 --> 00:02:20,077
No!

52
00:02:26,845 --> 00:02:28,744
No!

53
00:02:28,745 --> 00:02:30,411
Wh... Why?

54
00:02:46,345 --> 00:02:47,510
911 operator.

55
00:02:47,511 --> 00:02:48,544
Hello, police.

56
00:02:48,545 --> 00:02:49,777
Yes, ma'am.

57
00:02:49,778 --> 00:02:51,310
This is Kara Clayton.

58
00:02:51,311 --> 00:02:52,344
And what's your emergency?

59
00:02:52,345 --> 00:02:54,577
My husband tried to stab me to death.

60
00:02:54,578 --> 00:02:56,977
- Okay, ma'am.
- I shot him three times.

61
00:02:56,978 --> 00:02:59,177
I need you to stay on the line with me.

62
00:03:44,378 --> 00:03:46,844
Hey, where's Dr. Bull?

63
00:03:46,845 --> 00:03:48,377
Mm.

64
00:04:06,978 --> 00:04:08,010
Dr. Bull?

65
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:09,711
They're ready to see you now.

66
00:04:11,045 --> 00:04:12,910
Dr. Bull, Perry Sinclair.

67
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:14,644
- Hey.
- Thank you for joining us.

68
00:04:14,645 --> 00:04:16,510
Well, how could I resist?

69
00:04:16,809 --> 00:04:17,809
Look at this room.

70
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,108
Who do we have here?

71
00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:21,075
This is George Donahue,

72
00:04:21,076 --> 00:04:22,742
Clayton Communications' COO.

73
00:04:22,743 --> 00:04:23,775
Doctor.

74
00:04:23,776 --> 00:04:24,890
It's an honor.

75
00:04:25,576 --> 00:04:27,108
And look at this.

76
00:04:27,109 --> 00:04:29,208
Six different law firms
represented here.

77
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:31,308
It's like the New York Yankees
of attorneys.

78
00:04:31,309 --> 00:04:33,308
What happened? Bill Gates
run a traffic light?

79
00:04:34,676 --> 00:04:36,242
Have a seat, Dr. Bull.

80
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:39,108
All right, but only
'cause you outnumber me.

81
00:04:40,976 --> 00:04:42,575
What can I do for you fellas?

82
00:04:42,576 --> 00:04:44,808
I think it's what we can
do for you, Dr. Bull.

83
00:04:44,809 --> 00:04:46,937
We'd like to offer you a job.

84
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,308
You are a witness.

85
00:04:49,309 --> 00:04:51,191
And you have rights.

86
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:56,062
The opposition lawyer
turns to you and says,

87
00:04:56,142 --> 00:04:58,308
"Let's assume
the following hypothetical."

88
00:04:58,476 --> 00:05:00,876
You have the right to say...

89
00:05:02,543 --> 00:05:03,708
Marissa in here?

90
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:06,808
No, nope, nobody, just, uh, just me.

91
00:05:06,809 --> 00:05:09,460
Sorry.

92
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:15,008
Hey, I've been looking

93
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:16,708
all over for you.
What are you doing in here?

94
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:19,942
Going over the books
where no one can see them.

95
00:05:19,943 --> 00:05:21,875
Oh, the books are great.

96
00:05:21,876 --> 00:05:24,275
The books are gonna be fine.

97
00:05:24,276 --> 00:05:25,775
Oh, my goodness.

98
00:05:25,776 --> 00:05:27,075
A quarter of a million dollars?

99
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,742
Who gave you a check for
a quarter of a million dollars?

100
00:05:29,743 --> 00:05:32,008
The Clayton family estate.

101
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:34,508
They're pressuring the DA
to try the young widow Clayton

102
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:35,975
for the murder of her husband.

103
00:05:35,976 --> 00:05:37,854
Murder? Based on...

104
00:05:37,855 --> 00:05:39,328
Based on the fact that she shot him.

105
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:40,875
A fact she does not dispute.

106
00:05:40,876 --> 00:05:42,675
- Can you say "money in the bank"?
- Okay.

107
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,775
But according to the paper,
the late Mr. Clayton

108
00:05:44,776 --> 00:05:47,608
was attempting to slice and dice
his dearly beloved

109
00:05:47,609 --> 00:05:50,575
just prior to her deciding
to use him for target practice.

110
00:05:50,576 --> 00:05:52,175
I believe they call that "self-defense."

111
00:05:52,176 --> 00:05:54,275
Maybe. Or maybe she shot first

112
00:05:54,276 --> 00:05:56,175
and he stabbed her in self defense.

113
00:05:56,176 --> 00:05:57,642
Who cares?

114
00:05:57,643 --> 00:05:59,575
It's a quarter of a
million dollar retainer,

115
00:05:59,576 --> 00:06:02,275
and another quarter of a million
if we actually go to trial

116
00:06:02,276 --> 00:06:04,575
- and find Mrs. Clayton guilty.
- Wow.

117
00:06:04,576 --> 00:06:07,908
I had no idea the famous
Dr. Jason Bull can be bought.

118
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,142
For a quarter of a million dollars,

119
00:06:09,143 --> 00:06:10,143
not only can I be bought,

120
00:06:10,144 --> 00:06:12,375
you can gift wrap me.

121
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:14,008
Which reminds me,

122
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:15,275
guess who's in town?

123
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,942
I'm sorry, did I miss
a change of subject?

124
00:06:17,943 --> 00:06:21,351
The best un-wrapper in the world.

125
00:06:21,376 --> 00:06:24,426
Miss Diana Lindsay, attorney-at-law.

126
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:26,782
Single woman at large.

127
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:27,990
New York.

128
00:06:28,015 --> 00:06:29,384
What are you talking about?

129
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:31,142
New Yorkers, they sound
just like everybody else.

130
00:06:31,143 --> 00:06:32,608
French.

131
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:34,508
Do you come
to this ceiling often, monsieur?

132
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:37,775
And now your hometown, Callisto, Texas.

133
00:06:37,776 --> 00:06:40,431
Callisto, Texas? All right.

134
00:06:40,432 --> 00:06:43,842
That fella Bull,
he's all hat and no cattle.

135
00:06:43,843 --> 00:06:45,875
That's not what you said 15 minutes ago.

136
00:06:45,876 --> 00:06:47,575
Well, I'm sorry, darling, but I lied.

137
00:06:47,576 --> 00:06:49,476
Mm, that's what I love about you.

138
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:53,208
What? That I lie?

139
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:55,642
No, that there are so many of you.

140
00:06:55,643 --> 00:06:58,875
It's like I can cheat on you with you.

141
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:02,408
Well, I am glad you are in
such a good mood, Doctor.

142
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:03,573
Mm.

143
00:07:04,076 --> 00:07:05,776
I need a favor.

144
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:08,408
It's the reason I invited you over here.

145
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:11,708
Stupid me, I thought
I'd already done the favor

146
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:12,775
you invited me over here for.

147
00:07:12,776 --> 00:07:15,208
Hmm. Don't overestimate yourself.

148
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:16,475
That was my favor to you.

149
00:07:16,476 --> 00:07:17,908
- Ah.
- Mm.

150
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:18,876
Really?

151
00:07:18,877 --> 00:07:20,743
I need your help with something, Jason.

152
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,675
You know, ever since I lost that case

153
00:07:25,676 --> 00:07:27,242
where the sky bridge fell down,
I've been looking for

154
00:07:27,243 --> 00:07:29,808
another high-profile
New York opportunity.

155
00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:30,809
Something to

156
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,477
establish my name here.

157
00:07:33,395 --> 00:07:35,063
I think I found it.

158
00:07:36,643 --> 00:07:37,675
Kara Clayton.

159
00:07:37,676 --> 00:07:39,609
She's asked me to represent her.

160
00:07:40,284 --> 00:07:43,175
Her late husband's estate's been
putting all kinds of pressure

161
00:07:43,176 --> 00:07:44,775
on the DA to try her for murder.

162
00:07:44,776 --> 00:07:47,342
- You don't say.
- Well, the...

163
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:50,208
publicity alone makes this
an opportunity of a lifetime.

164
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:53,480
Not to mention the fact that
this is, uh, self-defense,

165
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:54,880
pretty cut and dried.

166
00:07:54,881 --> 00:07:56,247
I hear the other side's already gone out

167
00:07:56,248 --> 00:07:57,580
and hired the biggest guns in town

168
00:07:57,581 --> 00:07:58,824
- to go after her.
- I know.

169
00:07:58,849 --> 00:07:59,849
Mm.

170
00:07:59,874 --> 00:08:01,580
That's why I like it.

171
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,080
Diana versus Goliath.

172
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:04,213
You know? Boys against the girls.

173
00:08:04,214 --> 00:08:05,247
What?

174
00:08:05,248 --> 00:08:08,221
Except... one boy.

175
00:08:08,648 --> 00:08:10,280
I want you on my team, Jason.

176
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:14,247
I need you on my team.

177
00:08:16,214 --> 00:08:17,813
Okay, we're both naked
under these sheets here,

178
00:08:17,814 --> 00:08:19,380
you don't have to make that face
to let me know

179
00:08:19,381 --> 00:08:21,114
you're not excited.

180
00:08:24,048 --> 00:08:25,113
Diana, I can't.

181
00:08:25,114 --> 00:08:27,213
Yes, you can. You just have to want to.

182
00:08:27,214 --> 00:08:29,780
You just have to go into TAC
and clear up your schedule

183
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:32,078
because this is more important.

184
00:08:32,748 --> 00:08:34,180
I'm more important.

185
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,113
I've already signed with the other side.

186
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,248
I'm working with the Clayton estate.

187
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:41,847
Quit.

188
00:08:41,848 --> 00:08:43,547
I can't.

189
00:08:43,548 --> 00:08:45,947
And even if I wanted to,
I can't switch sides.

190
00:08:45,948 --> 00:08:47,313
It's a violation of professional ethics.

191
00:08:47,314 --> 00:08:48,514
You know that.

192
00:08:49,448 --> 00:08:51,914
I'm sorry.

193
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:08,780
Will I see you again
while you're still in town?

194
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:09,980
Absolutely.

195
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,714
In court, Goliath.

196
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,780
I'm really sorry.

197
00:09:17,781 --> 00:09:19,376
Then quit.

198
00:09:22,848 --> 00:09:31,017

199
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:39,041
How was dinner?

200
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:40,508
Oof. Never even got to dinner.

201
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:42,641
Well, that sounds like fun.

202
00:09:42,642 --> 00:09:44,141
Or not.

203
00:09:44,142 --> 00:09:46,274
I'm expecting our new clients
in about a half hour.

204
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:48,071
I have nothing for them.

205
00:09:48,742 --> 00:09:50,208
Bring them to the mock courtroom,

206
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:51,674
- make sure everybody's there.
- Got it.

207
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:52,908
Yeah, I should warn you, Bull,

208
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:54,674
Chunk's been looking
for you all morning.

209
00:09:54,675 --> 00:09:56,141
- What does he want?
- I don't know.

210
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:58,674
But he's... dressed strangely.

211
00:09:58,675 --> 00:10:01,084
Really? How can you tell?

212
00:10:03,975 --> 00:10:05,463
Who died?

213
00:10:05,842 --> 00:10:06,908
Pardon me?

214
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:08,374
You're pardoned.

215
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,042
What else can I do for you?

216
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:15,908
You're serving me with a summons?

217
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,941
You took the LSAT.

218
00:10:20,942 --> 00:10:24,074
- Law School Admission Test.
- Yep.

219
00:10:24,075 --> 00:10:26,208
167 out of 180.

220
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,774
That's impressive.

221
00:10:27,775 --> 00:10:29,274
Congratulations.

222
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:30,808
So you're thinking of
going to law school?

223
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:32,074
I'm not thinking about it,

224
00:10:32,075 --> 00:10:33,641
I'm doing it.

225
00:10:33,642 --> 00:10:36,741
I got accepted to Vanderbilt
in Nashville.

226
00:10:36,742 --> 00:10:38,108
Starting in January.

227
00:10:38,109 --> 00:10:39,541
Vanderbilt. Nashville.

228
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:40,674
That's a hell of commute.

229
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,474
I don't know how to swing it
in New York.

230
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:45,074
Even going to school at night,

231
00:10:45,075 --> 00:10:46,774
the cost of living on top of tuition...

232
00:10:46,775 --> 00:10:48,541
Is this a pitch for a raise?

233
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:50,308
I'm not pitching you anything.

234
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:53,178
This is me trying to be honorable.

235
00:10:53,642 --> 00:10:54,908
Telling you what's going on.

236
00:10:54,909 --> 00:10:56,808
So, if I gave you a raise

237
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:58,708
and if you went
to law school at night...

238
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:00,074
Well, that's a lot of ifs, Bull.

239
00:11:00,075 --> 00:11:02,008
Are you offering me a raise?

240
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:04,741
Honestly, Chunk, I don't know if I can.

241
00:11:04,742 --> 00:11:07,224
I have to consult with a higher power.

242
00:11:07,225 --> 00:11:09,108
I don't understand.
I just gave you a check

243
00:11:09,109 --> 00:11:10,808
for a quarter of a million
dollars yesterday.

244
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:12,941
Uh, Bull, that check just
barely got us back to even.

245
00:11:12,942 --> 00:11:14,208
How is that possible?

246
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:16,441
Look around. This fabulous office space,

247
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:19,241
all this equipment, all those employees.

248
00:11:19,242 --> 00:11:21,041
Every time you hold a mock trial,

249
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:22,808
we have to pay people
to sit on the jury.

250
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:24,408
Every time we have a client meeting,

251
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:25,409
you want it catered.

252
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,974
When you fly, it's first class.

253
00:11:26,975 --> 00:11:29,041
When you stay in a hotel,
it's a suite, not a room.

254
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:31,841
And it should be.
I'm a very successful person.

255
00:11:31,842 --> 00:11:34,208
Come on. Image is important.

256
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:37,108
I'm going in and I'm telling
lawyers, company presidents,

257
00:11:37,109 --> 00:11:39,808
people accused of very
serious crimes, what to do,

258
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:41,808
how to dress, how to speak.

259
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:43,708
No one is going to listen to me
if I take the bus

260
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:44,974
and sleep at the local campground.

261
00:11:44,975 --> 00:11:45,942
I'm sorry.

262
00:11:45,943 --> 00:11:47,441
You cannot give Chunk a raise.

263
00:11:47,442 --> 00:11:48,608
You just can't afford it.

264
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:50,674
But I don't want to lose him.

265
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:53,308
Well, neither do I,
but if you give Chunk a raise,

266
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:54,474
everyone else is gonna want one.

267
00:11:54,475 --> 00:11:56,908
Benny, Danny, Cable.
Look, I would like a raise.

268
00:11:56,909 --> 00:11:58,308
I have not had a raise in three years.

269
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:00,741
No.

270
00:12:00,742 --> 00:12:02,008
No, I just gave you a raise.

271
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:03,608
Remember? I called you from New Jersey.

272
00:12:03,609 --> 00:12:05,141
Seahawks were playing the Broncos.

273
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:06,142
It was the Superbowl.

274
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:07,508
I was in the skybox.

275
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:09,074
It was between quarters and...

276
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:11,574
"Gangnam Style" was playing
on the stadium P.A.

277
00:12:12,006 --> 00:12:13,541
So, did you use a cell phone

278
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:15,274
or was it the kind you had to crank?

279
00:12:15,275 --> 00:12:17,074
Yeah. I guess you're right.

280
00:12:17,075 --> 00:12:18,174
Time flies when you're not making money.

281
00:12:18,175 --> 00:12:20,008
Our new clients are here.

282
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:22,308
This conversation is not over.

283
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:23,741
Bull, you don't have any money.

284
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,061
There's nothing to talk about.

285
00:12:26,271 --> 00:12:27,408
And then...

286
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:30,008
we'll work with the DA
to pick the perfect jury.

287
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:33,341
And by monitoring the
reactions of our mirror jury,

288
00:12:33,342 --> 00:12:36,041
we will know at the end of each day

289
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:39,508
how our case is being presented
and what changes we need to make

290
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:43,274
to realize the best outcome
for our client.

291
00:12:43,275 --> 00:12:44,974
Very impressive.

292
00:12:44,975 --> 00:12:46,208
Uh, Dr. Bull...

293
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:48,074
But it starts with the narrative.

294
00:12:48,075 --> 00:12:51,841
The story we tell that
makes sense of what happened,

295
00:12:51,842 --> 00:12:56,108
but also supports our version
of the facts and leads everyone,

296
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,442
the judge and the jury,
to the same conclusion.

297
00:13:01,242 --> 00:13:02,515
The narrative.

298
00:13:03,275 --> 00:13:04,684
Which...

299
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,442
I don't have yet.

300
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:11,441
Dr. Bull,

301
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:13,608
any way we can speak privately?

302
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:14,909
Of course.

303
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:22,508
Our job is

304
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:24,274
to protect the Clayton estate.

305
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:26,508
If Mrs. Clayton recovers
from her injuries...

306
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:28,008
and from all appearances,

307
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:29,608
that's what's gonna happen...

308
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:34,108
she effectively becomes the new
owner of Clayton Communications.

309
00:13:34,109 --> 00:13:35,774
And as you can imagine,

310
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:39,708
Clayton's four grown children
are not fond of that scenario,

311
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:41,808
nor is the current board of directors.

312
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:43,808
Which is our way of saying

313
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:47,941
we understand it's hard to come
up with a strategy for a case

314
00:13:47,942 --> 00:13:51,842
that sure looks like
justifiable self-defense.

315
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,641
You lost me at "we understand."

316
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:59,008
We may go to court.

317
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:00,741
We may even go to criminal court,

318
00:14:00,742 --> 00:14:02,241
but that's not our goal.

319
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:03,374
That's not our endgame.

320
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,408
We look at this as a negotiation.

321
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:07,274
Ah.

322
00:14:07,275 --> 00:14:08,774
So, anything less than her walking away

323
00:14:08,775 --> 00:14:10,674
with 100% of the company
is a win for you.

324
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,174
Exactly.

325
00:14:12,175 --> 00:14:15,508
And I'm guessing you'd actually
be willing to forego

326
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:18,474
the whole murder trial
if there was a number

327
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:21,241
that you and Mrs. Clayton
could agree on. Right?

328
00:14:21,242 --> 00:14:22,308
Like I said,

329
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:24,374
we look at this as a negotiation.

330
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,308
Mm-hmm.

331
00:14:26,683 --> 00:14:27,808
Give me a figure.

332
00:14:28,226 --> 00:14:29,304
Why?

333
00:14:29,305 --> 00:14:31,308
'Cause I may be able to sew
this whole thing up for you

334
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:32,875
in the next 48 hours.

335
00:14:35,984 --> 00:14:37,674
500 million.

336
00:14:37,675 --> 00:14:39,201
Half a billion dollars.

337
00:14:39,202 --> 00:14:40,574
And she agrees to give up

338
00:14:40,575 --> 00:14:42,508
any rights or ownership in the company.

339
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:45,274
Sounds like a terrific
conversation starter to me.

340
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:46,841
Just one more thing.

341
00:14:46,842 --> 00:14:51,308
If you don't go to court
and I am instrumental

342
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:53,341
in helping you solve your problem,

343
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:56,042
I still get the other 250, right?

344
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,591
If you put our little problem to bed...

345
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:02,774
I'll make it 350.

346
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:09,241
Yes! Damn, I'm smart!

347
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,841
Damn, I'm smart.

348
00:15:10,842 --> 00:15:11,941
Damn, I'm smart.

349
00:15:11,942 --> 00:15:13,508
Damn, I'm smart.

350
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:16,874
Diana, it's Bull.

351
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:17,974
Can we talk?

352
00:15:17,975 --> 00:15:19,774
Did you quit yet?

353
00:15:19,775 --> 00:15:21,875
No, but I...

354
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,541
Diana, you don't understand.

355
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:30,141
I am gonna make you a winner,

356
00:15:30,142 --> 00:15:32,074
a giant winner.

357
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,242
Diana?

358
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,008
Cable, call the Oxwald Hotel,

359
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:41,308
- ask for Diana Lindsay.
- Sir, yes, sir!

360
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:42,908
Hey. They didn't fire us, did they?

361
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:45,974
- Fire us?
- Okay. Uh, she checked out.

362
00:15:45,975 --> 00:15:48,238
Danny, find out what hotel
Diana Lindsay checked into.

363
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,409
On it.

364
00:15:58,909 --> 00:16:01,108
Hey, aren't you that fantastic lawyer

365
00:16:01,109 --> 00:16:03,174
who got that amazing
settlement for that woman

366
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:04,741
who shot her billionaire husband?

367
00:16:04,742 --> 00:16:06,542
This man is stalking me.

368
00:16:08,442 --> 00:16:10,942
Sir. Hey, get the door. Stop him.

369
00:16:12,609 --> 00:16:15,416
Guys, let me out of here, please.

370
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,074
That's my wife. She needs a kidney.

371
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:19,575
I've decided to give her mine.

372
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:30,341
Oh. I'm excited to see you, too.

373
00:16:30,342 --> 00:16:32,641
- Get out.
- Is that any way to speak to someone

374
00:16:32,642 --> 00:16:34,308
who's about to make you
the most talked about attorney

375
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:35,708
in New York? It's okay, driver.

376
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:37,408
You can drive. Just a lover's spat.

377
00:16:37,409 --> 00:16:39,341
No, driver. We are not lovers.

378
00:16:39,342 --> 00:16:41,174
Well, not this minute, but it's early.

379
00:16:41,175 --> 00:16:42,474
I am not talking to you.

380
00:16:42,475 --> 00:16:44,008
You are not a good friend.

381
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:46,374
Why? Because I won't renege
on a professional commitment

382
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,774
the second you snap your fingers?

383
00:16:47,775 --> 00:16:49,741
And for the record, I am a great friend.

384
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:50,974
I am a fantastic friend.

385
00:16:50,975 --> 00:16:54,341
I am the Rachel of friends,
if Rachel were a boy.

386
00:16:54,342 --> 00:16:55,974
You used to be so smart.

387
00:16:55,975 --> 00:16:58,369
That not withstanding,
I'd like to proffer a settlement

388
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,874
from Clayton Communications
and the Clayton family.

389
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:00,974
Well, you can save your breath

390
00:17:00,975 --> 00:17:02,508
because we are not interested
in settling.

391
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:03,409
But you haven't heard the offer.

392
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,008
I don't need to hear the offer.

393
00:17:05,009 --> 00:17:05,975
Take a million dollars...

394
00:17:05,976 --> 00:17:07,874
You take a million dollars.

395
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,841
...and multiply it by 500.

396
00:17:09,842 --> 00:17:10,974
Wait, my mistake.

397
00:17:10,975 --> 00:17:12,141
Let me put it in another way.

398
00:17:12,142 --> 00:17:16,074
Take a billion dollars
and divide it in half.

399
00:17:16,477 --> 00:17:18,208
Is this for real?

400
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:19,641
Doesn't get any realer.

401
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,374
Call your client.

402
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:23,041
Tell her the good news.

403
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,441
Actually, I'm on my way
to see her right now.

404
00:17:25,442 --> 00:17:26,779
We can tell her together.

405
00:17:28,156 --> 00:17:30,032
Hello, Mrs. Clayton.

406
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,041
Hi. It's nice to see you again.

407
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:34,208
This is a friend of mine.

408
00:17:34,209 --> 00:17:35,908
Great friend, fantastic friend.

409
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:37,474
Dr. Jason Bull.

410
00:17:37,475 --> 00:17:39,108
Forgive me for not getting up.

411
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:42,241
This is a hyperbaric oxygen chamber.

412
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:45,006
I spend two hours a day in here.

413
00:17:45,082 --> 00:17:47,015
It's supposed to help my wounds heal.

414
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:49,074
But I'm sure you know
all about that, Doctor.

415
00:17:49,075 --> 00:17:51,674
Uh, no, he's not that
kind of doctor, Kara.

416
00:17:51,675 --> 00:17:53,641
He's working with the Clayton family,

417
00:17:53,642 --> 00:17:55,185
the legal team.

418
00:17:55,186 --> 00:17:58,709
They have a proposition
they would like to discuss.

419
00:18:01,135 --> 00:18:02,941
Thank you for seeing me.

420
00:18:02,942 --> 00:18:04,141
I realize this has been a horrible

421
00:18:04,142 --> 00:18:07,541
and traumatic experience and that, uh,

422
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:10,074
talk of money and settlements must seem

423
00:18:10,075 --> 00:18:12,608
disconcerting at the very least.

424
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:14,941
Nonetheless, the Claytons did ask me

425
00:18:14,942 --> 00:18:17,074
to convey a proposition to you.

426
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:19,574
In return for your agreeing
to give up any rights

427
00:18:19,575 --> 00:18:23,308
or ownership of the company,
the Clayton Communications Group

428
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:26,741
will use its considerable clout
to convince the DA

429
00:18:26,742 --> 00:18:28,308
to drop all the charges against you

430
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:30,808
related to the death
of your late husband.

431
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,141
The board of directors has
authorized me to offer you

432
00:18:33,142 --> 00:18:37,875
the sum of one half
billion dollars, tax free.

433
00:18:46,742 --> 00:18:48,008
I'm sure this is something

434
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:49,141
you're gonna want to think about.

435
00:18:49,142 --> 00:18:52,574
Discuss with your counsel, your family.

436
00:18:52,575 --> 00:18:54,374
Diana knows how to get in touch with me

437
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,609
when you've come to a decision.

438
00:18:57,442 --> 00:18:58,996
Doctor.

439
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:04,775
Do you have any idea how much
Clayton Communications is worth?

440
00:19:06,975 --> 00:19:10,140
Last estimate I read was
about six billion dollars.

441
00:19:10,141 --> 00:19:12,208
And under a normal circumstance,

442
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:15,308
since my husband was
the sole owner of the company,

443
00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:18,974
it would pass in its entirety
to me. Isn't that correct?

444
00:19:18,975 --> 00:19:21,908
These are not normal
circumstances, Mrs. Clayton.

445
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,241
Have you ever been stabbed, Doctor?

446
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:28,042
Can't say that I have.

447
00:19:29,842 --> 00:19:32,345
Three things went through
my mind while it was happening.

448
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:35,324
First, there's the pain.

449
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,108
The surgeons here said that
it's a miracle I'm alive.

450
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:42,475
The chest wound missed my heart
by just a centimeter.

451
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,641
Then there's the realization that

452
00:19:47,044 --> 00:19:50,172
the person doing it
pledged his life to me,

453
00:19:50,642 --> 00:19:53,774
sworn his love to me
over and over again,

454
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:59,441
and yet his face was filled
with nothing but hate, loathing.

455
00:20:00,725 --> 00:20:02,074
And then there's the business

456
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,228
of will I survive this?

457
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,609
Turns out I will.

458
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:13,195
Tell them I want all of it.

459
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:16,073
The whole six billion.

460
00:20:16,775 --> 00:20:18,274
Take me to court.

461
00:20:18,576 --> 00:20:19,974
Try me for murder.

462
00:20:19,975 --> 00:20:23,074
Tell them they can try
whatever they want.

463
00:20:23,075 --> 00:20:24,809
It's all gonna be mine.

464
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:29,274
It's not too late to quit.

465
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:31,941
I agree. You should definitely
give that some thought.

466
00:20:31,942 --> 00:20:33,341
Me?

467
00:20:33,342 --> 00:20:34,634
Darlin'...

468
00:20:35,475 --> 00:20:37,609
that woman's lying.

469
00:20:45,716 --> 00:20:48,735
The challenge is we all think
we know what happened.

470
00:20:48,736 --> 00:20:51,819
Woman's been stabbed, man's been shot.

471
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,319
We just fill in the middle.

472
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,452
But the truth is, we don't really know.

473
00:20:56,453 --> 00:21:00,119
So, this is the proposition
you wanted to discuss?

474
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,886
You want us to pick up the phone,

475
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:05,186
make a big contribution to the
DA's re-election campaign

476
00:21:05,187 --> 00:21:07,652
and twist his arm to press charges

477
00:21:07,653 --> 00:21:10,153
because you have a hunch?

478
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,452
Oh, it's more than a hunch.

479
00:21:14,453 --> 00:21:16,019
It's what I do for a living.

480
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,787
The woman is lying.

481
00:21:18,887 --> 00:21:20,319
There was emotion, but it was

482
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,519
the wrong emotion.

483
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,719
It was crystal clear, no confusion.

484
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,219
Almost as if it had been written,

485
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,686
as if it had been rehearsed,

486
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:32,019
as if she'd been contemplating
it for a long time.

487
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,786
And I don't know why she's
not telling the truth

488
00:21:34,787 --> 00:21:36,486
and I certainly don't know
what happened that night,

489
00:21:36,487 --> 00:21:39,752
but I do know she is lying.

490
00:21:39,753 --> 00:21:42,152
Correct me if I'm wrong, Dr. Bull,

491
00:21:42,153 --> 00:21:46,055
but with a murder trial, you
need all 12 jurors to convict.

492
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:47,253
That's correct.

493
00:21:47,254 --> 00:21:49,083
That's a very high bar.

494
00:21:49,853 --> 00:21:52,052
I'm tempted to say an impossible bar.

495
00:21:52,053 --> 00:21:54,286
Gentlemen. What do you have to lose?

496
00:21:54,287 --> 00:21:55,586
You've already paid me.

497
00:21:55,587 --> 00:21:59,019
If we don't win,
I cost you nothing more.

498
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,119
But if we do win, you,

499
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,386
the board, the entire Clayton family

500
00:22:03,387 --> 00:22:05,052
get to keep their company.

501
00:22:05,053 --> 00:22:07,652
Their legacy, their everything.

502
00:22:07,653 --> 00:22:09,719
Again, I got to tell you, the DA

503
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,286
doesn't want to touch this
with a ten-foot pole.

504
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:14,016
Well, tell them they don't have to.

505
00:22:14,017 --> 00:22:15,952
All they need to do is file the charges.

506
00:22:15,953 --> 00:22:18,652
Have them appoint
my in-house counsel Benny Colón

507
00:22:18,653 --> 00:22:20,219
as special assistant DA.

508
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,519
He used to work there.

509
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,219
That'll give the DA
plausible deniability

510
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,586
and give me more control.

511
00:22:25,161 --> 00:22:26,652
He can do that?

512
00:22:26,677 --> 00:22:29,543
It's rare, but it's done.

513
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,719
A lot of it hinges on the size
of your campaign contribution.

514
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,719
And what is it you're
looking for in return

515
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,919
for battling this particular
windmill, Dr. Quixote?

516
00:22:41,253 --> 00:22:43,786
Just the $250,000 bonus you promised me,

517
00:22:43,787 --> 00:22:46,486
and a law school scholarship fund

518
00:22:46,487 --> 00:22:48,086
for a person of my choosing.

519
00:22:48,087 --> 00:22:49,386
Any school in New York.

520
00:22:49,387 --> 00:22:50,986
You cover tuition and books

521
00:22:50,987 --> 00:22:53,287
for as long as it takes him or her.

522
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:57,219
Done.

523
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,087
See you in court, Dr. Bull.

524
00:23:01,853 --> 00:23:03,919
Ladies and gentlemen.

525
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,852
Let's begin voir dire.

526
00:23:05,853 --> 00:23:08,252
The world's already made up
its mind about this case.

527
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,152
So, what we're looking for

528
00:23:10,153 --> 00:23:12,286
are jurors with more
intellectual curiosity

529
00:23:12,287 --> 00:23:13,386
than certainty.

530
00:23:13,387 --> 00:23:15,652
The intellectual curiosity to at least

531
00:23:15,653 --> 00:23:17,486
consider the possibility
that one plus two

532
00:23:17,487 --> 00:23:18,652
doesn't always equal three.

533
00:23:18,653 --> 00:23:19,852
Be willing

534
00:23:19,853 --> 00:23:21,852
to search for the conclusions,

535
00:23:21,853 --> 00:23:23,552
rather than leaping to them.

536
00:23:23,553 --> 00:23:25,152
So a friend takes you to a restaurant

537
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,352
you've never been to before.

538
00:23:26,353 --> 00:23:28,719
It's the hottest reservation in town.

539
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,052
The waiter comes over and says

540
00:23:30,053 --> 00:23:31,886
there's an amazing special that night.

541
00:23:31,887 --> 00:23:33,854
Something you've never heard of before.

542
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,652
What do you do?

543
00:23:35,653 --> 00:23:38,052
Do you ask him what's in it?

544
00:23:38,053 --> 00:23:40,352
Do you look around the room
to see who else is eating it?

545
00:23:40,353 --> 00:23:42,552
Do you look up the recipe on your phone?

546
00:23:42,553 --> 00:23:44,686
Me? Uh...

547
00:23:44,687 --> 00:23:46,319
Probably order something I know.

548
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,420
- Something tried and true.
- Smart.

549
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,719
Move to strike, Your Honor.

550
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,952
That's a list of everyone
in the jury pool.

551
00:23:54,953 --> 00:23:57,386
You each have 15 names and 24 hours.

552
00:23:57,387 --> 00:23:59,452
I want to know everything
about everybody on that list.

553
00:23:59,453 --> 00:24:01,775
Where they work, where
they went to school.

554
00:24:01,776 --> 00:24:03,352
Everywhere they ever lived,
who they married,

555
00:24:03,353 --> 00:24:04,452
who they divorced

556
00:24:04,453 --> 00:24:06,252
and who they wish they'd married.

557
00:24:06,575 --> 00:24:08,552
Why do people get married?

558
00:24:09,098 --> 00:24:12,452
Uh, people get married
for a lot of different reasons.

559
00:24:12,453 --> 00:24:13,886
Name a couple.

560
00:24:13,887 --> 00:24:15,086
Children.

561
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:16,719
Companionship.

562
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,819
Uh, security.

563
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,252
- Now, when you say "security..."
- I, uh...

564
00:24:20,253 --> 00:24:21,319
Money.

565
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,286
I...

566
00:24:23,287 --> 00:24:26,286
Okay. Well, let me ask you a question.

567
00:24:26,287 --> 00:24:29,952
Do you think that you can
just look at a couple

568
00:24:29,953 --> 00:24:31,719
and know why they got married?

569
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:35,186
Oh, that's a... great question.

570
00:24:35,187 --> 00:24:36,792
Well, that's a good answer.

571
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,452
Acceptable to the prosecution,
Your Honor.

572
00:24:41,453 --> 00:24:43,552
Defense moves to strike, Your Honor.

573
00:24:43,553 --> 00:24:47,386
I've known Diana a long time.

574
00:24:47,387 --> 00:24:48,886
And she's really smart.

575
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,986
She knows what it is I do,
and she understands a lot

576
00:24:51,987 --> 00:24:53,452
about how it works.

577
00:24:53,453 --> 00:24:56,552
So we got to stay on our toes.

578
00:24:56,553 --> 00:24:58,352
What do you do for a living?

579
00:24:58,353 --> 00:24:59,486
I'm an actress.

580
00:24:59,487 --> 00:25:01,486
A professional dissembler. I love it.

581
00:25:01,487 --> 00:25:04,786
Nobody can spot a liar
faster than another liar.

582
00:25:04,787 --> 00:25:07,686
Now, is that how you
actually make your living?

583
00:25:07,687 --> 00:25:10,152
Well, not most of the time.

584
00:25:10,153 --> 00:25:12,886
I guess you could say,
I'm a motivational speaker.

585
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:14,019
Really?

586
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,719
Now, what is it that you
motivate people to do?

587
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:18,552
Buy things.

588
00:25:18,553 --> 00:25:20,652
- Ah.
- So you're in sales?

589
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:23,419
I guess that's another way of saying it.

590
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,119
This one's a firecracker.

591
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,919
So what is it that
you motivate people to buy?

592
00:25:28,302 --> 00:25:31,052
Whatever it is you need me to sell.

593
00:25:31,053 --> 00:25:32,419
I think I'm in love.

594
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,219
This woman can see
the virtue in anything

595
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,486
and then do everything she can
to sell it to everybody else.

596
00:25:37,487 --> 00:25:39,519
With any luck,
she'll be our jury foreman.

597
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,252
So a friend takes you to a restaurant

598
00:25:41,253 --> 00:25:42,785
that you've never been to before...

599
00:25:42,786 --> 00:25:45,486
I tell the waiter to surprise me.

600
00:25:45,487 --> 00:25:47,719
The more unexpected, the better.

601
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,852
Are you listening to this?

602
00:25:48,853 --> 00:25:50,520
It's positively pornographic.

603
00:25:51,453 --> 00:25:53,620
Yeah.

604
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,086
This juror is acceptable
to the prosecution,

605
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:57,552
Your Honor.

606
00:25:57,553 --> 00:25:59,152
Well, she's not acceptable
to the defense.

607
00:25:59,153 --> 00:26:00,619
We vote to strike this juror.

608
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,886
I think we hit a nerve.

609
00:26:01,887 --> 00:26:03,052
The defense

610
00:26:03,053 --> 00:26:05,152
has already exhausted all her strikes.

611
00:26:05,714 --> 00:26:07,919
You may be seated with the jury.

612
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,119
Ladies and gentlemen.

613
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,086
9:00 tomorrow morning,

614
00:26:11,087 --> 00:26:12,586
let the games begin.

615
00:26:12,587 --> 00:26:13,953
Swing and a miss.

616
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:35,070
Sounds like you're at a Yankees game.

617
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:37,371
More like a bullfight. No pun intended.

618
00:26:47,727 --> 00:26:49,070
No photos.

619
00:26:49,071 --> 00:26:51,437
No photography allowed in the courtroom.

620
00:26:51,438 --> 00:26:53,638
No photos!

621
00:26:57,138 --> 00:26:58,670
Lady knows how to make an entrance.

622
00:26:58,671 --> 00:26:59,803
Mm-hmm.

623
00:26:59,804 --> 00:27:02,771
God had some party the
night he cooked her up.

624
00:27:03,404 --> 00:27:04,970
So it is your testimony

625
00:27:04,971 --> 00:27:07,470
as Marcus Clayton's principal counsel,

626
00:27:07,471 --> 00:27:09,703
that the defendant
and Mr. Clayton entered

627
00:27:09,704 --> 00:27:12,703
into a prenuptial agreement
prior to their marriage.

628
00:27:12,704 --> 00:27:13,770
Yes.

629
00:27:13,771 --> 00:27:16,003
It was very important to Mr. Clayton

630
00:27:16,004 --> 00:27:18,037
that there be no misunderstandings

631
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:20,403
should either he or Mrs. Clayton

632
00:27:20,404 --> 00:27:22,037
decide to dissolve

633
00:27:22,038 --> 00:27:24,103
the marriage at some later date.

634
00:27:24,104 --> 00:27:25,403
So can you explain to us how this

635
00:27:25,404 --> 00:27:26,937
prenuptial agreement worked?

636
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:29,170
Well, without going
into too much specific detail,

637
00:27:29,171 --> 00:27:31,537
the agreement was structured so that

638
00:27:31,538 --> 00:27:35,770
as long as Mrs. Clayton met
certain weekly, monthly

639
00:27:35,771 --> 00:27:39,403
and yearly obligations,
with regard to travel,

640
00:27:39,404 --> 00:27:42,603
uh, the entertaining
of business associates

641
00:27:42,604 --> 00:27:44,737
or...

642
00:27:44,738 --> 00:27:47,903
the performance of, uh,

643
00:27:47,904 --> 00:27:51,270
certain, uh, intimate acts...

644
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:54,337
...that are annotated in the agreement,

645
00:27:54,338 --> 00:27:55,737
then, over time,

646
00:27:55,738 --> 00:27:57,503
she would accrue a higher payout,

647
00:27:57,504 --> 00:28:01,337
when and if the marriage dissolved.

648
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:07,570
My goodness. The level of engagement

649
00:28:07,571 --> 00:28:09,070
is off the charts.

650
00:28:09,071 --> 00:28:10,970
So, for instance...

651
00:28:10,971 --> 00:28:14,570
So for instance, if the marriage
had only lasted one year,

652
00:28:14,571 --> 00:28:16,835
and had Mrs. Clayton

653
00:28:16,836 --> 00:28:19,970
fulfilled her obligations
per the agreement,

654
00:28:19,971 --> 00:28:22,637
she would have received
one million dollars.

655
00:28:24,978 --> 00:28:26,170
Wow.

656
00:28:27,064 --> 00:28:29,537
Sounds more like a business
agreement than a, uh...

657
00:28:29,538 --> 00:28:31,770
I object to the inference, Your Honor.

658
00:28:31,771 --> 00:28:33,837
Objection sustained.

659
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:36,170
Keep your opinions
to yourself, Counselor.

660
00:28:36,171 --> 00:28:37,703
My apologies, Your Honor.

661
00:28:37,704 --> 00:28:39,303
Please continue, Mr. Sinclair.

662
00:28:39,304 --> 00:28:41,903
Now, for every year
she stays in the marriage,

663
00:28:41,904 --> 00:28:44,070
the amount actually doubles.

664
00:28:44,071 --> 00:28:48,237
So for two years, she would've
received two million dollars.

665
00:28:48,238 --> 00:28:50,737
For three years, four million dollars.

666
00:28:50,738 --> 00:28:52,200
For four years,

667
00:28:52,201 --> 00:28:53,703
eight million dollars.

668
00:28:53,704 --> 00:28:56,403
And had the marriage ended today,

669
00:28:56,404 --> 00:29:01,703
Mrs. Clayton would have walked
away with $16 million.

670
00:29:06,804 --> 00:29:09,237
$16 million.

671
00:29:09,238 --> 00:29:11,370
That's... a nice payday

672
00:29:11,371 --> 00:29:13,837
- for five years' work.
- Your Honor.

673
00:29:13,838 --> 00:29:16,137
Uh... my apologies again, Your Honor.

674
00:29:16,138 --> 00:29:18,403
I wish you could see juror 39.

675
00:29:18,404 --> 00:29:20,303
She's lapping this up with a spoon.

676
00:29:20,304 --> 00:29:22,037
My queen bee.

677
00:29:22,038 --> 00:29:24,570
Counting on you to whip
the rest of the hive into shape.

678
00:29:24,571 --> 00:29:25,703
Let's just say,

679
00:29:25,704 --> 00:29:28,270
neither party wanted
the marriage to dissolve.

680
00:29:28,271 --> 00:29:30,403
But one of them, say, Mr. Clayton,

681
00:29:30,404 --> 00:29:33,637
became deathly ill and succumbed.

682
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:36,570
Or was in a traffic accident
and lost his life.

683
00:29:36,571 --> 00:29:40,237
Or was shot point-blank range
in the chest.

684
00:29:40,238 --> 00:29:41,238
Objection.

685
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:42,270
Overruled.

686
00:29:42,271 --> 00:29:43,737
But get to the question, please.

687
00:29:43,738 --> 00:29:46,103
What would Mrs. Clayton be looking at?

688
00:29:46,104 --> 00:29:47,837
Payout-wise?

689
00:29:47,838 --> 00:29:50,237
Well, minus some stipulations
in his will

690
00:29:50,238 --> 00:29:52,941
with regard to his four children,

691
00:29:53,471 --> 00:29:56,103
she would inherit everything.

692
00:29:56,104 --> 00:29:58,203
Meaning...?

693
00:29:58,204 --> 00:30:01,103
The entire Clayton
Communications empire.

694
00:30:01,104 --> 00:30:02,203
Which is worth...?

695
00:30:02,204 --> 00:30:03,270
As of today?

696
00:30:03,271 --> 00:30:06,670
$6.65 billion.

697
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:13,203
Wow. Talk about establishing motive.

698
00:30:13,204 --> 00:30:16,237
Eight of the mirror jurors
who were totally on Diana's side

699
00:30:16,238 --> 00:30:18,437
just moved over to ours.

700
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:23,472
Thank you, Mr. Sinclair, for
that illuminating explanation.

701
00:30:24,431 --> 00:30:26,037
I just have one question.

702
00:30:26,808 --> 00:30:29,070
How much would Mrs. Clayton
have received

703
00:30:29,071 --> 00:30:31,670
had she been stabbed to death?

704
00:30:34,438 --> 00:30:36,170
Hmm.

705
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:38,570
Never mind.

706
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:40,489
I withdraw the question.

707
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:42,903
Forget I said that.

708
00:30:42,904 --> 00:30:45,437
Three of the eight went back to Diana.

709
00:30:45,438 --> 00:30:49,737
Hey, we still ended up with
five more than we came in with.

710
00:30:49,738 --> 00:30:51,037
See you when I see you.

711
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:52,637
See you when I see you.

712
00:30:52,638 --> 00:30:54,937
Yes, that trial.

713
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:58,603
Uh-huh. Well, I know you're
hearing about it on TV,

714
00:30:58,604 --> 00:31:00,133
but I'm there.

715
00:31:00,538 --> 00:31:02,603
All right. Okay. I love you too, Mama.

716
00:31:02,604 --> 00:31:03,637
Bye.

717
00:31:04,471 --> 00:31:06,137
I'm sorry.

718
00:31:06,138 --> 00:31:07,470
Couldn't help but overhear.

719
00:31:07,471 --> 00:31:09,037
Was that a Texas accent?

720
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:10,537
Well, it sure was.

721
00:31:10,538 --> 00:31:12,203
Oh. Whereabouts?

722
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,903
Callisto, Texas?

723
00:31:13,904 --> 00:31:14,937
You ever heard of it?

724
00:31:14,938 --> 00:31:16,970
Actually, I have.

725
00:31:19,571 --> 00:31:21,655
Who vetted juror 39?

726
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,103
I did.

727
00:31:25,104 --> 00:31:26,937
She's from Callisto.

728
00:31:26,938 --> 00:31:28,870
Callisto, Texas!

729
00:31:28,871 --> 00:31:31,103
The same town as Diana.

730
00:31:31,104 --> 00:31:33,370
You didn't see that?
That didn't ring any bells?

731
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:35,370
Wasn't something you thought
I might want to know about?

732
00:31:35,371 --> 00:31:37,670
What exactly are you saying, Bull?

733
00:31:37,671 --> 00:31:39,047
I'm saying she's a plant.

734
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:41,203
Oh.

735
00:31:41,204 --> 00:31:42,703
Diana set me up.

736
00:31:42,704 --> 00:31:45,837
She suckered me in
hook, line and sinker.

737
00:31:45,838 --> 00:31:48,737
I need all 12 jurors,

738
00:31:48,738 --> 00:31:52,561
and now, no matter what happens
in that courtroom,

739
00:31:53,438 --> 00:31:55,638
I will only have 11.

740
00:32:10,072 --> 00:32:11,670
Good evening. Affilian Hotel.

741
00:32:11,671 --> 00:32:13,670
Diana Lindsay, room 1667.

742
00:32:13,671 --> 00:32:14,871
Please hold.

743
00:32:17,438 --> 00:32:19,470
- Hello?
- I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

744
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:22,170
I'm impressed you can sleep
with so much on your conscience.

745
00:32:22,171 --> 00:32:24,337
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

746
00:32:24,338 --> 00:32:26,770
Well, let's start
with your lying client,

747
00:32:26,771 --> 00:32:29,270
and then move to the ringer
you snuck on the jury.

748
00:32:29,271 --> 00:32:30,870
Yeah, okay, I'm hanging up now.

749
00:32:30,871 --> 00:32:32,237
Oh, you do that, Diana.

750
00:32:32,238 --> 00:32:34,337
'Cause I don't care
about you or your ringers.

751
00:32:34,338 --> 00:32:36,303
I'm going to present
such an effective case

752
00:32:36,304 --> 00:32:37,670
the jury's gonna come back 11 to one,

753
00:32:37,671 --> 00:32:39,337
the judge will declare a mistrial,

754
00:32:39,338 --> 00:32:40,703
and we will be back in six months.

755
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,170
And I will personally send your client

756
00:32:43,171 --> 00:32:44,503
to the electric chair.

757
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,403
Jason Bull, you are simultaneously

758
00:32:46,404 --> 00:32:47,970
one of the smartest men I have ever met

759
00:32:47,971 --> 00:32:49,470
and one of the dumbest.

760
00:32:49,471 --> 00:32:51,337
Well, clearly, you don't
meet enough people.

761
00:32:51,338 --> 00:32:52,937
Look...

762
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:55,637
I don't even know
what juror you're talking about.

763
00:32:55,638 --> 00:32:58,903
And as far as my client lying?
Well, I beg to differ.

764
00:32:58,904 --> 00:33:01,837
In fact, she is so anxious
to tell her story

765
00:33:01,838 --> 00:33:03,870
that she has insisted
I put her on the stand tomorrow.

766
00:33:03,871 --> 00:33:06,470
Oh... I don't care
if you put her on the stand,

767
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:07,803
I don't care if she takes the Fifth.

768
00:33:07,804 --> 00:33:09,470
I don't care if she drinks a fifth.

769
00:33:09,471 --> 00:33:11,537
Your client is lying.

770
00:33:11,538 --> 00:33:13,837
Would you like to know how I know?

771
00:33:13,838 --> 00:33:15,737
Guys with more money than God,

772
00:33:15,738 --> 00:33:18,803
they don't stab the women
they want to get rid of.

773
00:33:18,804 --> 00:33:19,870
They pay them!

774
00:33:19,871 --> 00:33:22,570
"Here's $100 million. Go away."

775
00:33:22,571 --> 00:33:23,937
It's clean, it's quick,

776
00:33:23,938 --> 00:33:25,303
and everybody gets what they want.

777
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:27,370
And that is how I know
your client did it.

778
00:33:27,371 --> 00:33:30,003
He didn't want out, she did.

779
00:33:31,671 --> 00:33:33,471
Hello?

780
00:33:34,044 --> 00:33:35,510
Hello?

781
00:33:35,738 --> 00:33:37,603
Hmm.

782
00:33:37,604 --> 00:33:40,237
If you're here
to apologize, you're too late.

783
00:33:40,238 --> 00:33:42,170
You better check the
temperature in hell.

784
00:33:42,171 --> 00:33:43,937
I haven't come to apologize.

785
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,637
I haven't done anything wrong.

786
00:33:45,638 --> 00:33:49,003
You gave me 15 people
to check out in 24 hours,

787
00:33:49,004 --> 00:33:50,887
and I missed something.

788
00:33:51,338 --> 00:33:53,103
It's human, Dr. Bull.

789
00:33:53,104 --> 00:33:56,137
And it mystifies me that you can
know so much and not know that.

790
00:33:56,138 --> 00:33:57,570
You're the second woman to tell me

791
00:33:57,571 --> 00:33:59,937
how much I do and don't know
in the last ten minutes.

792
00:33:59,938 --> 00:34:01,437
I'm starting to take offense.

793
00:34:01,438 --> 00:34:04,470
Well, maybe you should listen,
because three minutes ago,

794
00:34:04,471 --> 00:34:07,570
I realized that, uh,
you missed something, too.

795
00:34:07,571 --> 00:34:09,803
What's this? The evidence file?

796
00:34:09,804 --> 00:34:11,003
I've already been through this.

797
00:34:11,004 --> 00:34:12,136
There's nothing in here.

798
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:14,937
Yeah, that's what you missed...
the nothing.

799
00:34:14,938 --> 00:34:16,537
Look at the gun.

800
00:34:18,171 --> 00:34:19,503
There's nothing to look at.

801
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:21,370
There's no prints on the gun.

802
00:34:21,371 --> 00:34:24,537
Exactly. She shot him three times.

803
00:34:24,538 --> 00:34:27,204
Yeah? How is that possible?

804
00:34:29,138 --> 00:34:30,469
I don't know.

805
00:34:31,538 --> 00:34:33,437
But I know who to ask.

806
00:34:34,264 --> 00:34:36,070
You can say thank you, now.

807
00:34:36,071 --> 00:34:37,392
Thank you.

808
00:34:39,728 --> 00:34:41,938
And I'm sorry.

809
00:34:43,738 --> 00:34:46,070
Any chance I could convince you to stay

810
00:34:46,071 --> 00:34:48,153
and help me figure out what this means?

811
00:34:52,171 --> 00:34:53,438
Okay.

812
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:01,037
But if you ever throw something
at me again,

813
00:35:01,038 --> 00:35:02,837
I swear, you will live to regret it.

814
00:35:02,838 --> 00:35:05,604
I'm stupid, I'm not a moron.

815
00:35:13,982 --> 00:35:15,447
Defense calls Kara Clayton.

816
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:17,682
Look at the two of them...
smug and smugger.

817
00:35:25,866 --> 00:35:27,192
You ready?

818
00:35:28,315 --> 00:35:29,614
Never readier.

819
00:35:30,403 --> 00:35:31,947
Let's talk about that night.

820
00:35:32,322 --> 00:35:34,074
Can you take me through what happened?

821
00:35:35,537 --> 00:35:39,037
My late husband was a very driven man.

822
00:35:39,448 --> 00:35:41,681
He was also given to paranoia.

823
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:44,114
And over time, he became convinced

824
00:35:44,115 --> 00:35:46,147
that I was seeing someone younger.

825
00:35:46,148 --> 00:35:47,181
Were you?

826
00:35:47,182 --> 00:35:49,986
No. I loved my husband.

827
00:35:50,011 --> 00:35:51,876
So, on this particular night...

828
00:35:52,048 --> 00:35:53,581
He was trying to close a deal

829
00:35:53,582 --> 00:35:57,581
to buy a communications
consortium in Australia,

830
00:35:57,582 --> 00:35:59,781
and it wasn't going well.

831
00:36:00,141 --> 00:36:03,603
He called me into his study to...

832
00:36:05,021 --> 00:36:06,748
comfort him.

833
00:36:07,982 --> 00:36:09,847
And did you?

834
00:36:09,848 --> 00:36:11,289
No.

835
00:36:12,215 --> 00:36:14,414
I told him that I didn't like it
when he demanded things,

836
00:36:14,415 --> 00:36:18,614
that I liked it better when
things happened naturally.

837
00:36:18,615 --> 00:36:20,181
And then what happened?

838
00:36:20,182 --> 00:36:21,788
He got angry.

839
00:36:23,182 --> 00:36:25,882
As angry as I'd ever seen him.

840
00:36:28,048 --> 00:36:30,347
Accused me of having a lover.

841
00:36:30,714 --> 00:36:32,514
Started reminding me about our prenup,

842
00:36:32,515 --> 00:36:36,548
about... what I was required to do.

843
00:36:37,982 --> 00:36:40,081
I hate to be bearer of bad news...

844
00:36:40,082 --> 00:36:43,447
Please. It ain't over
till the pretty lady sings.

845
00:36:43,448 --> 00:36:44,514
And then?

846
00:36:44,515 --> 00:36:46,771
And... then he...

847
00:36:47,515 --> 00:36:49,983
got up from his desk,

848
00:36:50,415 --> 00:36:52,481
came over to me,

849
00:36:52,482 --> 00:36:55,196
demanded that I do what he wanted.

850
00:36:56,415 --> 00:36:58,158
I said no.

851
00:36:59,015 --> 00:37:03,947
And that's when I noticed he had
one hand behind his back.

852
00:37:03,948 --> 00:37:06,714
So, help me understand.

853
00:37:06,715 --> 00:37:09,247
He grabbed you with one hand.

854
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:11,281
By the back of my neck.

855
00:37:11,282 --> 00:37:12,381
And his other hand?

856
00:37:12,382 --> 00:37:14,547
Was behind his back.

857
00:37:14,548 --> 00:37:17,715
That's where the knife was. That's...

858
00:37:19,015 --> 00:37:20,714
That's when he started stabbing me.

859
00:37:20,715 --> 00:37:23,048
Three times.

860
00:37:24,351 --> 00:37:26,114
Three times.

861
00:37:26,115 --> 00:37:27,881
Do you have the strength
to stand up and show us

862
00:37:27,882 --> 00:37:29,114
where the three wounds are?

863
00:37:29,115 --> 00:37:30,899
I think so.

864
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,282
One here.

865
00:37:40,115 --> 00:37:43,647
They said this one just missed
my heart by maybe a centimeter.

866
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,247
Wow.

867
00:37:45,872 --> 00:37:47,747
One here,

868
00:37:47,748 --> 00:37:49,281
and one here.

869
00:37:49,282 --> 00:37:50,847
And this one, too. They say this one

870
00:37:50,848 --> 00:37:52,347
just missed the femoral artery.

871
00:37:52,348 --> 00:37:53,414
Thank you, Mrs. Clayton.

872
00:37:53,415 --> 00:37:55,015
You can sit down now.

873
00:37:56,257 --> 00:37:58,315
I have no further questions, Your Honor.

874
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:08,447
Mrs. Clayton, just curious...

875
00:38:08,448 --> 00:38:10,948
what was your major in college?

876
00:38:15,548 --> 00:38:16,747
Finance.

877
00:38:16,748 --> 00:38:18,947
Finance? Really?

878
00:38:19,389 --> 00:38:22,315
Huh. Now, was that always your major?

879
00:38:23,998 --> 00:38:26,224
Objection. Relevance.

880
00:38:26,225 --> 00:38:27,648
Counselor? Relevance?

881
00:38:27,649 --> 00:38:29,181
Your Honor,

882
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:31,042
if you'll allow me to continue...

883
00:38:32,293 --> 00:38:35,081
I think the relevance will be obvious.

884
00:38:35,082 --> 00:38:36,965
Certainly to the jury.

885
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,034
Mm, yeah. Thank you.

886
00:38:39,035 --> 00:38:40,847
Drumroll, please.

887
00:38:40,848 --> 00:38:43,147
I'm sorry, you... you were saying?

888
00:38:43,148 --> 00:38:45,724
What did you study prior to finance?

889
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,314
Anatomy.

890
00:38:50,315 --> 00:38:51,715
Anatomy?

891
00:38:52,948 --> 00:38:55,381
That's the study of the human body.

892
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:57,585
The internal organs.

893
00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:59,781
Where things are. Got it.

894
00:38:59,782 --> 00:39:02,147
We're starting to see movement.

895
00:39:02,148 --> 00:39:04,081
Buckle up,

896
00:39:04,082 --> 00:39:05,381
we're just getting started.

897
00:39:05,382 --> 00:39:06,614
I'm sorry,

898
00:39:06,615 --> 00:39:07,781
I got us off track here.

899
00:39:07,782 --> 00:39:09,714
So, your late husband was...

900
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:11,207
he was stabbing you.

901
00:39:12,148 --> 00:39:13,514
One way up there,

902
00:39:13,515 --> 00:39:16,014
one way down there, one in the middle.

903
00:39:16,015 --> 00:39:17,647
Just missed your heart,
just missed your liver,

904
00:39:17,648 --> 00:39:19,814
just missed anything
of importance down there.

905
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,781
- Objection.
- Sustained.

906
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:25,314
And somehow, in the middle of all this,

907
00:39:25,548 --> 00:39:26,780
you grabbed a gun?

908
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:29,914
There was a small table
where he always kept one.

909
00:39:29,915 --> 00:39:31,947
So, it was just right there.

910
00:39:31,948 --> 00:39:33,014
Three steps away.

911
00:39:33,015 --> 00:39:34,400
While you were being stabbed.

912
00:39:34,401 --> 00:39:35,381
Yes.

913
00:39:35,382 --> 00:39:37,020
- Already loaded?
- Yes.

914
00:39:37,021 --> 00:39:39,481
And so you grabbed the gun, and...

915
00:39:39,482 --> 00:39:40,614
and you shot him with it?

916
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:42,181
Yes.

917
00:39:42,182 --> 00:39:44,981
Then why are there
no fingerprints on the gun?

918
00:39:53,348 --> 00:39:54,614
I don't understand.

919
00:39:54,615 --> 00:39:56,114
What does this have to do with anything?

920
00:39:56,115 --> 00:39:57,881
You shot someone three times

921
00:39:57,882 --> 00:39:59,748
and left no fingerprints on the gun?

922
00:40:01,615 --> 00:40:03,281
But I already admitted to shooting him.

923
00:40:03,282 --> 00:40:05,714
- Isn't that beside the point?
- Not to me.

924
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,647
Were you wearing gloves, Mrs. Clayton?

925
00:40:07,648 --> 00:40:10,115
Why would I wear gloves?

926
00:40:12,315 --> 00:40:15,047
Why would I try to keep
my fingerprints off the gun?

927
00:40:15,048 --> 00:40:18,381
Not off the gun. Off the knife.

928
00:40:18,733 --> 00:40:21,081
When you were stabbing yourself
so you'd have an alibi

929
00:40:21,082 --> 00:40:22,782
for shooting your husband.

930
00:40:23,915 --> 00:40:25,414
And for what reason would I do that?

931
00:40:25,415 --> 00:40:27,114
I can think of six billion of them.

932
00:40:27,661 --> 00:40:29,394
Before you answer that...

933
00:40:30,548 --> 00:40:32,614
...and possibly perjure yourself,

934
00:40:32,615 --> 00:40:34,047
I should let you know that the NYPD was

935
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,881
at your apartment early this morning,

936
00:40:35,882 --> 00:40:38,281
and confiscated
the contents of a shredder

937
00:40:38,282 --> 00:40:39,914
that was in your husband's office.

938
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:41,599
It appeared to contain

939
00:40:41,624 --> 00:40:43,447
what was once a pair of latex gloves.

940
00:40:43,842 --> 00:40:46,114
The DNA results will
be in later in the day.

941
00:40:47,415 --> 00:40:48,481
Your witness.

942
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:52,914
Order!

943
00:40:52,915 --> 00:40:54,818
It's a clean sweep.

944
00:40:54,843 --> 00:40:56,008
Nothing but green.

945
00:40:56,348 --> 00:40:58,414
Yeah, well, that's the mirror jury.

946
00:40:58,415 --> 00:41:00,715
The real one's coming in 11 to one.

947
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,548
Have you reached a verdict?

948
00:41:12,549 --> 00:41:14,048
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

949
00:41:15,331 --> 00:41:18,150
This jury unanimously finds

950
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:20,747
the defendant, Kara Clayton,

951
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:23,514
guilty of first-degree murder.

952
00:41:33,482 --> 00:41:36,081
And as quickly as it consumed us,

953
00:41:36,082 --> 00:41:38,214
the scandal fades from memory,

954
00:41:38,215 --> 00:41:42,647
replaced by the business
of everyday life.

955
00:42:29,015 --> 00:42:30,547
Hey, aren't you that fantastic attorney

956
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,847
who tried to tell me that
you'd never pull

957
00:42:31,848 --> 00:42:33,081
any funny stuff with the jury

958
00:42:33,082 --> 00:42:35,018
because you're much
better friend than I am,

959
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,581
much better person,
much better everything?

960
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:39,814
And aren't you the one who said

961
00:42:39,815 --> 00:42:42,047
I was representing a liar,

962
00:42:42,048 --> 00:42:45,281
a killer, a black widow?

963
00:42:45,713 --> 00:42:47,815
I guess we're even.

964
00:42:49,048 --> 00:42:50,681
Hmm.

965
00:42:50,682 --> 00:42:54,097
So, certainly got your name
in the paper a lot.

966
00:42:57,216 --> 00:42:58,447
Think you'll be back?

967
00:42:58,448 --> 00:42:59,981
Oh, you can count on it, Dr. Bull.

968
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,281
I'm not done with you yet.

969
00:43:02,282 --> 00:43:04,514
I told you, I like 'em stupid.

970
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:06,947
Really? Me, stupid?

971
00:43:06,948 --> 00:43:08,981
Mm-hmm. Give me a stupid genius

972
00:43:08,982 --> 00:43:11,148
over a smart idiot any day.

1
00:00:00,672 --> 00:00:02,875
The trip was amazing;
it was perfect.

2
00:00:02,916 --> 00:00:04,525
We swam with stingrays.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,610
Randy got a great tan.

4
00:00:06,675 --> 00:00:10,481
And then it rained for two
days, so we got married.

5
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:12,270
<i>taking off shortly.</i>

6
00:00:12,337 --> 00:00:14,731
Yes, Aunt Diana, for real.

7
00:00:15,597 --> 00:00:18,075
I know it sounds crazy,
but I'm telling you,

8
00:00:18,168 --> 00:00:19,610
it was meant to be.

9
00:00:19,675 --> 00:00:21,030
Thank you.

10
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:23,614
I got to go, we're
at our seats.

11
00:00:23,995 --> 00:00:25,895
Yes, I have
lots of pictures.

12
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:27,530
I'll send pictures.

13
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,709
Okay. Love you, too.

14
00:00:30,992 --> 00:00:32,888
Sounds like that went all right.

15
00:00:39,895 --> 00:00:41,441
Hello?

16
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:42,930
Mr. Greene.

17
00:00:43,846 --> 00:00:45,208
<i>My boss.</i>

18
00:00:45,527 --> 00:00:47,450
Uh, no, I'm still
out of the country.

19
00:00:47,624 --> 00:00:48,907
Another two days.

20
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,954
Uh, I'm actually
on a plane right now,

21
00:00:51,021 --> 00:00:52,135
getting ready to take off.

22
00:00:53,613 --> 00:00:55,645
Can't you get
Emerson to help you?

23
00:00:56,206 --> 00:00:57,747
You're alone?

24
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,079
Well, like I said,

25
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,138
I'm-I'm on a plane
full of people.

26
00:01:03,639 --> 00:01:05,437
I-I know they don't know
what we're talking about,

27
00:01:05,502 --> 00:01:06,902
but still,
it makes me nervous.

28
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:08,649
And besides, I don't know
your combination.

29
00:01:08,714 --> 00:01:09,953
I only know mine.

30
00:01:11,253 --> 00:01:13,805
Okay, no, it's fine.

31
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,243
I'm being silly.

32
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:16,606
Do you have a pencil?

33
00:01:16,872 --> 00:01:18,198
Okay, here goes.

34
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:20,796
77...

35
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:22,235
63...

36
00:01:22,327 --> 00:01:24,413
11, 46.

37
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,165
Can you say it back to me?

38
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:28,757
Exactly.

39
00:01:29,725 --> 00:01:31,783
Nope, no trouble
at all, Mr. Greene.

40
00:01:32,274 --> 00:01:34,898
Oh, and by the way,
when you see me in two days,

41
00:01:34,963 --> 00:01:36,767
I'll have
a new last name.

42
00:01:37,577 --> 00:01:39,400
Uh-huh, I got married.

43
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:44,353
No, you don't need
to make us a ring.

44
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:47,283
You, too. Okay.

45
00:01:47,656 --> 00:01:49,100
That was like watching
a foreign film

46
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:50,954
without the subtitles.

47
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:53,582
Oh. Poor Mr. Greene.

48
00:01:53,896 --> 00:01:55,338
He needs to sell
the store.

49
00:01:55,403 --> 00:01:56,434
He's too old.

50
00:01:56,499 --> 00:01:58,333
I mean, he can't even
remember his combination

51
00:01:58,398 --> 00:02:00,001
to the safe anymore.

52
00:02:01,123 --> 00:02:02,603
He wants
to make us a ring.

53
00:02:02,695 --> 00:02:04,762
I told you, I have a ring.

54
00:02:04,827 --> 00:02:07,306
Yeah, well, talk is cheap.

55

Sorry, allergies.

57
00:02:21,073 --> 00:02:22,330
Oh.

58
00:02:30,156 --> 00:02:31,835
Congratulations.

59
00:02:32,831 --> 00:02:34,249
Heard you on the phone.

60
00:02:34,715 --> 00:02:36,253
Oh. Thank you.

61
00:02:36,344 --> 00:02:38,850
Boss wants to
make you a ring, huh?

62
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,202
I'm guessing
you're in jewelry.

63
00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:42,493
Retail?

64
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:45,397
Yeah, it's not my forever job,
but it pays the rent.

65
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:48,331
- My ex-wife was in jewelry.
- Oh.

66
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:53,370
I think she wore
the same perfume you're wearing.

67
00:02:54,196 --> 00:02:56,120
Eau de Bonne Jeunesse?

68
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,922
Y-Yeah. Randy got it for me.

69
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,846
- Always made me sneeze.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

70
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,706
Everything makes me sneeze.

71
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:07,600
Three more hours
before the sun comes up.

72
00:03:07,978 --> 00:03:09,530
I'm gonna try
and get some sleep.

73
00:03:09,595 --> 00:03:11,608
Okay. You want to get
out before I settle in?

74
00:03:11,673 --> 00:03:12,846
No, I'm good.

75
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:16,120
Okay, see you
in the morning, newlywed.

76
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:17,880
See you in the morning.

77
00:03:21,088 --> 00:03:22,810
No. No, no, no.

78
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,877
- No.
- What's the matter?

79
00:03:24,962 --> 00:03:26,637
I can't find my phone.

80
00:03:27,056 --> 00:03:28,766
I have all my pictures
on that phone.

81
00:03:28,831 --> 00:03:29,975
Our-our wedding,
our honeymoon.

82
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,209
I have everything on that phone.

83
00:03:31,274 --> 00:03:32,733
Well, it's got to be
here someplace.

84
00:03:32,798 --> 00:03:34,820
I'll call it from my phone.Oh.
Is this it?

85
00:03:35,191 --> 00:03:36,202
Oh, my God.

86
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:37,303
Yes.
It was on the floor.

87
00:03:37,368 --> 00:03:39,846
Yes. Yes, thank you.

88
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:49,804

Maybe I'm crazy but it feels
like some of you is missing.

93
00:04:07,174 --> 00:04:08,784
Well, I made a pledge
the last time you left,

94
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,135
I wouldn't eat
until you returned.

95
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,315
Well, had I known that,

96
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,265
I would have stayed away
for another six months.

97
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:14,819

- Hmm.

98

<i>♪ Make me feel so brand-new♪ ...</i>

00:04:19,613 --> 00:04:21,668
Don't take this the wrong way,
I'm thrilled that you're here.

100
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:23,989
But... what is this dire emergency

101
00:04:24,054 --> 00:04:25,876
you woke me
out of a dead sleep for?

102
00:04:27,612 --> 00:04:29,639
I just didn't know
who else to call.

103
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:33,036
I flew in from Texas last night
and I'm staring at

104
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:35,384
an arraignment
in 20 minutes and...

105
00:04:36,226 --> 00:04:38,748
while I do believe
with all my heart

106
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:40,088
that you are
one of the dumbest

107
00:04:40,153 --> 00:04:42,763
hunks of man that I have ever
had the pleasure

108
00:04:42,828 --> 00:04:44,790
of sharing pleasure with...

109
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,587
I will also concede...

110
00:04:47,945 --> 00:04:49,372
that no one can navigate

111
00:04:49,437 --> 00:04:51,048
a New York City courtroom
better than you.

112
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,118
I feel so cheap when women
just use me for my mind.

113
00:04:55,521 --> 00:04:58,028
Obviously, I'll get you
through the arraignment

114
00:04:58,093 --> 00:05:00,948
but... let's start with
who you're representing

115
00:05:01,015 --> 00:05:02,634
and what's the crime?

116
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,345
I'm here for my niece.

117
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:05,656
What's the charge?

118
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:07,227
Armed robbery.

119
00:05:07,445 --> 00:05:08,559
In the matter of.

120
00:05:08,624 --> 00:05:12,470
The People v. Claire
and Randy Markes...

121
00:05:12,632 --> 00:05:13,923
how do you plead?

122
00:05:14,085 --> 00:05:16,965
Both Claire and Randy Markes
plead not guilty, Your Honor.

123
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,618
Counsel, would you like
to be heard as to bail?

124
00:05:20,686 --> 00:05:22,524
We certainly would,
Your Honor.

125
00:05:22,726 --> 00:05:24,684
Your Honor, the People
at this time would ask

126
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:25,778
that no bail be offered.

127
00:05:25,843 --> 00:05:27,409
On a burglary charge?

128
00:05:27,476 --> 00:05:29,130
The store's owner
is still in the hospital

129
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:32,055
and the prognosis for
his recovery is not yet clear.

130
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:35,188
We could be looking at murder
charges in the days to come.

131
00:05:35,476 --> 00:05:38,420
Additionally, the defendants
recently traveled to...

132
00:05:38,487 --> 00:05:41,551
Thailand, Sri Lanka,
and the Maldives,

133
00:05:41,616 --> 00:05:43,505
which doesn't have
an extradition treaty

134
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,075
with the U.S.
It's the People's view

135
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,462
that the defendants represent
a very real flight risk.

136
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,824
- Oh, my God.
- DIANA: Your Honor.

137
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:51,895
- Please.
- My clients have no record

138
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,058
of previous charges,

139
00:05:53,123 --> 00:05:55,102
no record of previous arrests.

140
00:05:55,179 --> 00:05:57,458
They don't even have points
on their driver's licenses.

141
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,934
Be that as it may,

142
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:01,361
the court will accept
the A.D.A.'s recommendations

143
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,704
and deny bail
at this time.

144
00:06:06,163 --> 00:06:08,716
Ask the court officer to find a
place we can meet with our clients

145
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,305
before they're taken
back to jail.

146
00:06:10,831 --> 00:06:12,684
- None of this makes any sense.
- All right,

147
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:14,583
well, let's just start
at the beginning, okay?

148
00:06:14,648 --> 00:06:17,356
Now, this is my friend,
Dr. Jason Bull.

149
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:19,026
He's a legal genius.

150
00:06:19,093 --> 00:06:21,098
But we don't tell
him that to his face

151
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:23,188
because we don't want to
make his head any bigger.

152
00:06:23,619 --> 00:06:25,124
He'll be assisting us
with the trial

153
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:27,441
and doing everything
he possibly can

154
00:06:27,506 --> 00:06:30,899
to make sure that we get you out
of here as quickly as we can.

155
00:06:31,765 --> 00:06:35,620
So, both of you will be
representing both of us?

156
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,759
We'll work out
the particulars later

157
00:06:38,826 --> 00:06:41,626
but right now, I'd like
to get Dr. Bull up to speed.

158
00:06:42,364 --> 00:06:45,469
Okay, the store
that Claire works at,

159
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,985
it's a, uh, mom-and-pop
jewelry store in Brooklyn.

160
00:06:49,138 --> 00:06:52,700
It was robbed at gunpoint
two nights ago

161
00:06:52,765 --> 00:06:54,058
at 2:30 in the morning.

162
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:56,331
Everybody wore
masks and gloves

163
00:06:56,396 --> 00:06:58,849
but we have a ton of video.

164
00:06:59,077 --> 00:07:02,548
Unfortunately, the two robbers
very much resemble

165
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:05,954
both Claire and Randy,
height-wise and weight-wise.

166
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,692
Okay, and what about
this man who was hurt?

167
00:07:08,757 --> 00:07:10,343
The one who's in the hospital?

168
00:07:10,468 --> 00:07:11,818
Mr. Greene.

169
00:07:12,023 --> 00:07:14,512
He's old
and starting to lose it.

170
00:07:14,577 --> 00:07:16,528
Sometimes he forgets
where he is.

171
00:07:16,593 --> 00:07:18,661
Sometimes he forgets
who he is.

172
00:07:18,726 --> 00:07:20,701
Apparently, he was
sleeping in his office

173
00:07:20,768 --> 00:07:22,263
when the robbers came in.

174
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,309
The police said
he was pistol-whipped

175
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:25,924
to within an inch of his life.

176
00:07:25,991 --> 00:07:27,820
Hmm. Okay.

177
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,569
And what convinced
the authorities

178
00:07:29,634 --> 00:07:30,616
you two were involved?

179
00:07:30,691 --> 00:07:32,143
Well, the safe they hit...

180
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,715
keeps track of every time
it's opened and who opened it.

181
00:07:34,782 --> 00:07:36,364
Now, each store manager, they...

182
00:07:36,431 --> 00:07:39,048
And really, there are
only three, including the owner.

183
00:07:39,187 --> 00:07:40,645
They have their
own combination.

184
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,482
Hmm. And somehow
the robbers knew to use yours.

185
00:07:45,027 --> 00:07:46,152
Okay.

186
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,572
Let's talk alibi.

187
00:07:47,637 --> 00:07:49,607
What were you two doing
at 2:30 in the morning

188
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,834
when the store was being robbed
and your boss was being beaten?

189
00:07:52,926 --> 00:07:54,121
Well, at 2:30 in
the morning

190
00:07:54,188 --> 00:07:56,459
we were where we
were supposed to be.

191
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:59,889
At home in
bed together.

192
00:08:01,021 --> 00:08:02,560
I'm Randy, by the way.

193
00:08:02,795 --> 00:08:04,639
Yeah, it's nice
to meet you, Randy.

194
00:08:04,707 --> 00:08:06,771
And unfortunately,
two codefendants,

195
00:08:06,874 --> 00:08:09,679
two married codefendants
vouching for each other

196
00:08:09,744 --> 00:08:11,924
is not the world's
strongest alibi.

197
00:08:11,989 --> 00:08:14,396
I'm assuming that there's
no one staying with you?

198
00:08:14,496 --> 00:08:16,092
No one called
in the middle of the night?

199
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,202
No. Like we told the
police, it was just us.

200
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:20,959
Asleep by midnight.

201
00:08:22,563 --> 00:08:24,423
So, can I count on you?

202
00:08:24,488 --> 00:08:26,216
You know, back me up?

203
00:08:26,457 --> 00:08:28,006
Whisper in my ear?

204
00:08:28,512 --> 00:08:30,717
How well do you know
your niece's new husband?

205
00:08:30,894 --> 00:08:32,747
This is the first
time I ever met him.

206
00:08:32,816 --> 00:08:35,071
Ah, and you love him already. Mm.

207
00:08:35,489 --> 00:08:36,672
What's this?

208
00:08:36,737 --> 00:08:38,193
Randy's record.

209
00:08:38,556 --> 00:08:40,361
He has a record.

210
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,697
Ah, there's a couple
of juvie convictions.

211
00:08:43,764 --> 00:08:45,042
One for petty theft.

212
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:47,219
He got in a bar fight
three years ago.

213
00:08:47,284 --> 00:08:49,403
He hit someone in the head
with a guitar.

214
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:51,571
Is this guy a musician?

215
00:08:51,636 --> 00:08:52,644
Well...

216
00:08:52,722 --> 00:08:54,898
based on this record, he could
be a Supreme Court justice.

217
00:08:54,963 --> 00:08:56,229
I'm here to represent her.

218
00:08:56,294 --> 00:08:58,211
I don't even know him.
And that's fine.

219
00:08:58,276 --> 00:08:59,833
They should have
separate representation.

220
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:01,759
You don't want either one
of them looking back

221
00:09:01,826 --> 00:09:03,587
and thinking that their lawyer
wasn't looking out

222
00:09:03,654 --> 00:09:05,313
for them and only them.

223
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,547
Okay, good.

224
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,239
So he's not my problem.

225
00:09:09,277 --> 00:09:10,761
But he is.

226
00:09:11,472 --> 00:09:13,552
What you don't want is
this guy you don't know

227
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,034
out there on his own with
his own legal team,

228
00:09:16,101 --> 00:09:18,302
his own narrative
that you can't control.

229
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:21,290
You know, this would be
a much easier conversation

230
00:09:21,355 --> 00:09:22,633
with a drink.

231
00:09:22,698 --> 00:09:24,200
Why don't we do this?

232
00:09:24,488 --> 00:09:27,364
You represent Claire,
my firm will represent Randy.

233
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:29,841
You'd do that?

234
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:32,324
Why?

235
00:09:32,402 --> 00:09:33,543
For you.

236
00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:35,532
And because it's smart;
I got a hundred reasons.

237
00:09:35,597 --> 00:09:37,241
Name one.

238
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:38,841
Well, let's start
with the A.D.A.

239
00:09:38,906 --> 00:09:40,422
First chance he gets,
he's gonna offer

240
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:42,180
your niece
or her husband a deal.

241
00:09:42,245 --> 00:09:43,438
Divide and conquer.

242
00:09:43,503 --> 00:09:44,566
They're innocent.

243
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:46,337
Well, at least she is.

244
00:09:46,402 --> 00:09:48,586
Any defense is only as good
as its weakest link.

245
00:09:48,651 --> 00:09:49,883
You let Randy fall
into the clutches

246
00:09:49,948 --> 00:09:51,769
of some public defender
who's juggling

247
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:52,985
- 16 other cases...
- Okay.

248
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,714
Okay, I see where you're going.

249
00:09:54,852 --> 00:09:56,270
Two separate defense teams.

250
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,672
Working together.
You and me.

251
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:02,629
It's just really important
we're completely transparent

252
00:10:02,694 --> 00:10:04,191
with one another;
we need to send a message

253
00:10:04,256 --> 00:10:05,660
to the A.D.A.
that neither one of us

254
00:10:05,725 --> 00:10:07,213
is gonna sell the other side out

255
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:08,934
and that there's no point
trying to smear Randy

256
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:12,032
with 15-year-old charges from
when he was in middle school.

257
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:17,045
You really are something.

258
00:10:19,415 --> 00:10:20,813
So here's the plan:

259
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:23,660
I'll provide TAC resources
for both sides.

260
00:10:23,725 --> 00:10:26,953
You represent Claire
and Benny'll represent Randy.

261
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:28,819
Hmm.

262
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,617
So what are you drinking?

263
00:10:36,494 --> 00:10:37,665
Oh.

264
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:40,274
I'm sure I'll find something.

265
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,744

269
00:10:57,686 --> 00:10:58,706
How'd it go?

270
00:10:58,771 --> 00:11:00,292
I just got off
the phone with him.

271
00:11:00,357 --> 00:11:03,445
He filled me in, e-mailed me
all the relevant work product.

272
00:11:04,116 --> 00:11:07,688
Ah. Well, then,
let's do this.

273
00:11:09,174 --> 00:11:10,426
What's the matter?

274
00:11:10,491 --> 00:11:11,899
I don't know.

275
00:11:12,308 --> 00:11:14,500
Something in his voice.

276
00:11:14,914 --> 00:11:17,991
- He sounded like the old Bull.
- Well, we love the old Bull.

277
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,797
Not that old Bull.

278
00:11:20,202 --> 00:11:22,414
Ah, Marissa,

279
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:25,641
he and Diana
are old friends.

280
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,215
It's no secret they enjoy
the hell out of each other.

281
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:32,289
He probably just...
stayed out past his curfew.

282
00:11:33,686 --> 00:11:35,327
Besides...

283
00:11:37,127 --> 00:11:39,415
he's gonna do
what he's gonna do.

284
00:11:41,656 --> 00:11:42,981
So, the plan of action

285
00:11:43,046 --> 00:11:46,164
is to request a joint trial
for Claire and Randy.

286
00:11:46,669 --> 00:11:48,797
One jury for both defendants?

287
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,207
That's what he wants.

288
00:11:50,272 --> 00:11:53,320
But wouldn't conventional
wisdom be to split them up?

289
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:55,543
Well, since Bull and Diana
are so close,

290
00:11:55,608 --> 00:11:57,609
and since the two defendants
are newlyweds,

291
00:11:57,702 --> 00:11:59,988
Bull is throwing out the
conventional wisdom on this one.

292
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,496
He believes the optics are
just too good to ignore.

293
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:05,211
The jury seeing them together,
it all feeds into the narrative.

294
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,195
Which is...

295
00:12:07,264 --> 00:12:09,649
They just didn't do it.
They couldn't have done it.

296
00:12:09,725 --> 00:12:11,691
Someone is setting them up,
taking advantage of two

297
00:12:11,756 --> 00:12:13,168
sweet young kids
who just got married

298
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,883
and are being wrongly jailed
for something they didn't do.

299
00:12:16,155 --> 00:12:19,582
We'll lean on reasonable doubt,
present character evidence

300
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:21,605
for both of them,
and then hope, in the meantime,

301
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:25,391
that the real robbers slip up
and somehow reveal themselves.

302
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:27,418
Well, I can put in
a call to the FBI.

303
00:12:27,483 --> 00:12:29,105
I've got a friend who can
check on the chatter

304
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:32,484
of known fences, and pawn shops
that deal in stolen diamonds.

305
00:12:32,592 --> 00:12:34,471
Then I'll head over
to the jewelry store,

306
00:12:34,702 --> 00:12:37,477
talk to the girl's coworkers,
see what they know.

307
00:12:37,636 --> 00:12:40,121
And I should head over to court,
meet our new clients,

308
00:12:40,186 --> 00:12:43,524
say hi to Diana and get ready
for the start of voir dire.

309
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:47,762
And give me a call if I have
anything I need to worry about

310
00:12:47,827 --> 00:12:50,500
on that other front.

311
00:12:50,694 --> 00:12:52,164
He's fine.

312
00:12:52,256 --> 00:12:54,326
He's a big boy, Marissa.

313
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,297
There she is!

314
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:05,897
I've been looking all over
for the two of you.

315
00:13:05,962 --> 00:13:08,167
Come here.
Where's the big guy?

316
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:25,118
Yeah, we've, uh...

317
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:27,893
really been slammed
at work lately.

318
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,694
I honestly don't know
when the man sleeps.

319
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:31,822
Right now.

320
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,655
- Right.
- And last night.

321
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,406
We went out for drinks.

322
00:13:35,473 --> 00:13:37,460
He was on his second one,
and that man looked like

323
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,622
- he was about to keel over.
- Mm.

324
00:13:39,687 --> 00:13:42,292
Last time I was here,
it took two just to prime his pump.

325
00:13:42,837 --> 00:13:43,956
Yeah, well, you know,

326
00:13:44,025 --> 00:13:46,479
the problem is the man
never gets a break.

327
00:13:47,174 --> 00:13:50,979
I think I'm gonna just
slip in there and, uh,

328
00:13:51,196 --> 00:13:53,487
yeah,
give him a little nudge.

329
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:05,456
Did I drift off?

330
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:07,745
Looks that way.

331
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,487
Diana's waiting for you
outside.

332
00:14:10,592 --> 00:14:13,745
- Oh, she's something, isn't she?
- Mm.

333
00:14:14,157 --> 00:14:16,667
Sounds like you had a bit
of a rugged night.

334
00:14:16,877 --> 00:14:20,933
Oh, no, just, uh,
a little out of practice.

335
00:14:20,998 --> 00:14:23,407
Oh. Well, I'm confused.

336
00:14:23,692 --> 00:14:25,315
I didn't know
you needed to practice.

337
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,370
I thought
you were retired.

338
00:14:28,407 --> 00:14:29,987
It was "Old Timers' Day."

339
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,641
Felt good to be back
on the field.

340
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:35,011
Ah, well, I wouldn't want
to deny you that.

341
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:38,425
But voir dire is calling.

342
00:14:38,492 --> 00:14:41,417
Ah, well,
if voir dire is calling,

343
00:14:41,553 --> 00:14:43,136
we must answer.

344
00:14:44,376 --> 00:14:45,741
It's Claire's combination.

345
00:14:45,806 --> 00:14:47,491
It's Claire's place
of employment.

346
00:14:47,556 --> 00:14:49,956
She's a young married woman
with a musician for a husband,

347
00:14:50,095 --> 00:14:51,698
so of course
she needs money.

348
00:14:51,773 --> 00:14:53,120
And that means what?

349
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,280
That means we want jurors
who tend to believe

350
00:14:55,345 --> 00:14:57,905
the simplest explanation
is not always the right one.

351
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,034
You mean like
conspiracy theorists?

352
00:15:00,126 --> 00:15:02,378
No, not necessarily
that radical.

353
00:15:02,454 --> 00:15:05,742
Just people who are willing to
consider alternative narratives.

354
00:15:06,177 --> 00:15:11,830
Show of hands.
Area 51. Proof of aliens?

355
00:15:13,616 --> 00:15:17,422
Or... Area 51.
Government hoax?

356
00:15:17,662 --> 00:15:18,933
I'm confused.

357
00:15:18,998 --> 00:15:21,280
We want to keep the folks who
believe we're being visited

358
00:15:21,347 --> 00:15:24,022
by little green men, or
we want to keep the people

359
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,515
who believe Area 51

360
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:26,735
is a government hoax?

361
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:28,084
We keep 'em all
for the moment.

362
00:15:28,151 --> 00:15:29,748
They're willing
to believe something

363
00:15:29,813 --> 00:15:32,276
they don't know for certain
and can't really prove.

364
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:34,615
And then we do our best to try
and get rid of the ones

365
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,463
who didn't raise their hand
for either choice.

366
00:15:37,883 --> 00:15:39,443
Good morning.

367
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,998
I'm afraid I owe you
all an apology.

368
00:15:42,063 --> 00:15:43,891
On your way in,
I picked your pockets

369
00:15:43,956 --> 00:15:45,658
and stole all your wallets.

370
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:51,799
I noticed that you didn't need
to check your pockets, sir.

371
00:15:51,922 --> 00:15:54,021
- No.
- And why not?

372
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,771
Because I know there's no way
in the world you took my wallet.

373
00:15:56,836 --> 00:15:59,662
Barry Fletcher.
Of course he's a skeptic.

374
00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:02,593
He works as an actuary
at an insurance company.

375
00:16:02,658 --> 00:16:05,285
A non-believer
and a numbers cruncher.

376
00:16:06,025 --> 00:16:07,741
The defense would ask
the court to thank

377
00:16:07,806 --> 00:16:09,610
and excuse juror number seven.

378
00:16:09,806 --> 00:16:11,769
Juror number 11.

379
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:14,322
I couldn't help but notice
that you checked.

380
00:16:14,498 --> 00:16:17,168
Your purse, your pockets,
your coat.

381
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:19,616
Well, I thought maybe you were
just messing with us,

382
00:16:19,681 --> 00:16:21,347
but you can never be
too careful.

383
00:16:21,474 --> 00:16:23,382
Sophia Holmes. Unemployed.

384
00:16:23,447 --> 00:16:25,389
And according to her
credit card statement,

385
00:16:25,454 --> 00:16:28,172
she sees a tarot card reader
at least once a month.

386
00:16:28,433 --> 00:16:30,057
I've died and gone to heaven.

387
00:16:30,258 --> 00:16:33,932
Now, just to be clear,
you needed to be sure.

388
00:16:34,511 --> 00:16:36,669
You had a doubt.
A reasonable doubt.

389
00:16:36,877 --> 00:16:38,085
Sure.

390
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:39,416
Thank you, Benny.

391
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:40,988
Plant the seed.
Reasonable doubt.

392
00:16:41,055 --> 00:16:44,252
Say it loud, you're unsure
and you're proud.

393
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,206
That is terrific news.
I'll pass it along.

394
00:16:49,282 --> 00:16:51,089
What's terrific news?

395
00:16:52,673 --> 00:16:55,151
I could use some
terrific news.

396
00:16:55,251 --> 00:16:58,882
The store's owner, Mr. Greene,
is recovering quite nicely,

397
00:16:58,947 --> 00:17:01,222
and may even be well enough
to testify tomorrow.

398
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:02,731
- That's excellent.
- Mm.

399
00:17:02,796 --> 00:17:04,207
So much for murder charges.

400
00:17:04,272 --> 00:17:07,288
Maybe we could even revisit
the question of bail.

401
00:17:07,353 --> 00:17:11,214
- Hm
- Well, thank you for dinner, sir.

402
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:24,438
I can feel your
heart beating.

403
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,290
That's always a good sign.

404
00:17:30,193 --> 00:17:32,446
So tomorrow it starts.

405
00:17:33,048 --> 00:17:36,414
Yup. Tomorrow it starts.

406
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:39,408
You want to run that
opening statement by me?

407
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:44,186
No.
I want to go dancing.

408
00:17:44,969 --> 00:17:46,861
- Excuse me?
- Mm.

409
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:50,744
Once this trial starts,
we're not gonna have any time.

410
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:53,963
Every night is gonna be about
preparing for the next day.

411
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:56,759
It's the last night
of summer vacation.

412
00:17:56,852 --> 00:17:58,625
I want to go dancing.

413
00:17:58,692 --> 00:18:00,955
I haven't been dancing
in 15 years.

414
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,322
Well, all the more
reason to go, then.

415
00:18:07,513 --> 00:18:09,219
- I will go dancing.
- Mm.

416
00:18:09,284 --> 00:18:11,627
And we will go back to
your hotel room.

417
00:18:12,031 --> 00:18:14,056
You're reading my mind.

418
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:17,025
And then you will read me
your opening statement.

419
00:18:17,891 --> 00:18:20,564
T- here will be openings.
- Oh?

420
00:18:20,745 --> 00:18:22,728
There will be statements.

421
00:18:24,174 --> 00:18:26,384
I don't know if
there'll be any reading,

422
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,541
but... then again,
you never know.

423
00:18:30,266 --> 00:18:31,758
- Hmm.
- Mm.

Baby, you still with us?

451
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:37,941
I need to go.

452
00:20:39,712 --> 00:20:43,028
Um...
you do understand

453
00:20:43,093 --> 00:20:45,028
what is next on the menu,
don't you?

454
00:20:46,382 --> 00:20:47,964
Um...

455
00:20:49,472 --> 00:20:51,251
I'll explain it to you later.
I just, uh...

456
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:52,817
I have to...

457
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:54,950
I've got to get some fresh air.

458
00:20:56,558 --> 00:20:59,637
Uh, who are you and what have
you done with Jason Bull?

459
00:21:01,699 --> 00:21:03,638
I'm so sorry.

460
00:21:19,954 --> 00:21:21,983
First witness for
the prosecution after lunch

461
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,417
is your boss.

462
00:21:23,484 --> 00:21:25,596
Okay. Good.

463
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,346
He must be doing better.

464
00:21:28,489 --> 00:21:29,810
He loves me.

465
00:21:30,884 --> 00:21:33,049
Well, be that as it may,

466
00:21:33,165 --> 00:21:35,467
if the prosecution didn't think
he had something to offer,

467
00:21:35,532 --> 00:21:36,865
they wouldn't be
putting him on the stand.

468
00:21:36,932 --> 00:21:38,839
What could he offer?
We weren't there.

469
00:21:38,939 --> 00:21:42,452
I have no idea.
But let's drill down

470
00:21:42,517 --> 00:21:45,678
on the obvious for a second.
It wasyour combination

471
00:21:45,743 --> 00:21:47,471
that opened the
safe that night.

472
00:21:47,626 --> 00:21:50,354
If it wasn't you, who was it?

473
00:21:51,462 --> 00:21:52,572
Uh, how would I know?

474
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:54,162
- Dr. Bull...
- Have you ever shared

475
00:21:54,227 --> 00:21:56,424
your combinationwith anyone
who isn't authorized to have it?

476
00:21:56,512 --> 00:21:58,346
- No.
- Is it written down somewhere

477
00:21:58,415 --> 00:21:59,622
where someone could find?

478
00:21:59,689 --> 00:22:02,264
- No.
- So you've never told your combination

479
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:04,358
to anyone,
never even uttered it out loud?

480
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:05,868
No.

481
00:22:07,345 --> 00:22:08,681
Yes.

482
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,651
Five days before the robbery,
Mr. Greene called me.

483
00:22:14,728 --> 00:22:16,182
He forgets things.

484
00:22:16,321 --> 00:22:18,733
He forgot his combination,
and I gave him mine.

485
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,284
He forgets things?

486
00:22:20,588 --> 00:22:23,354
Forgets the combination
to his own safe?

487
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:24,956
Well, he's old.

488
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:28,479
And I know it kills him
to ask for help.

489
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:32,699
Well, obviously your boss didn't
rob and pistol-whip himself.

490
00:22:33,181 --> 00:22:34,987
That's the only time
you can recall?

491
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:37,099
That's the only time
it ever happened.

492
00:22:40,757 --> 00:22:43,227
Uh, we didn't do this.

493
00:22:43,384 --> 00:22:46,706
He knows youdidn't
do anything, honey.

494
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:53,420
Well, there is one more thing
I want to clear up.

495
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,698
The D.A.'s office sent
these over last night.

496
00:22:59,987 --> 00:23:01,436
Look familiar?

497
00:23:01,501 --> 00:23:02,634
Yeah.

498
00:23:02,712 --> 00:23:05,260
I have one just
like it. Or, I did.

499
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:06,876
I think I lost it
in Thailand.

500
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,561
Well,
this was found

501
00:23:08,626 --> 00:23:10,600
outside the jewelry store
the night of the robbery.

502
00:23:10,665 --> 00:23:13,159
Police, at first, didn't think
there was any connection.

503
00:23:13,329 --> 00:23:16,819
Took them a couple days to, uh,
find the camp, and get a list

504
00:23:16,884 --> 00:23:18,140
of the people who were
at the reunion.

505
00:23:18,207 --> 00:23:19,702
Only 200 of these were made.

506
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:20,952
What are you implying?

507
00:23:21,017 --> 00:23:22,270
Why don't you tell us?

508
00:23:22,337 --> 00:23:23,755
There's nothing to tell.

509
00:23:24,024 --> 00:23:26,983
I was in bed beside my wife
the entire night.

510
00:23:27,048 --> 00:23:29,784
And I haven't seen that hat
since we got back.

511
00:23:33,798 --> 00:23:35,284
Tell them, honey.

512
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:39,749
I actually don't know
anything about your hat.

513
00:23:39,814 --> 00:23:43,979
No, I mean, tell them I was in
bed with you the whole night.

514
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:47,896
She's already told us that.

515
00:23:47,971 --> 00:23:49,950
No one's implying anything.

516
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,846
We're all in this together.

517
00:23:53,449 --> 00:23:55,433
I was sleeping in my office.

518
00:23:55,781 --> 00:23:57,280
Do you do that often?

519
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:59,315
It's not something I plan.

520
00:23:59,407 --> 00:24:01,448
Lot of times at night,
I can't sleep.

521
00:24:01,517 --> 00:24:05,635
So when I come in the next day
to work, I'm exhausted.

522
00:24:06,118 --> 00:24:09,842
I close up,
sit down in my office

523
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:12,323
about 8:00,
do my paperwork,

524
00:24:12,506 --> 00:24:14,533
and end up
conking out in my chair.

525
00:24:14,695 --> 00:24:15,965
So what happened?

526
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:21,608
Ah. Alarm went off,
2:30 in the morning,

527
00:24:21,673 --> 00:24:23,200
scared the life out of me.

528
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,817
And the only way they can get
through is in the front,

529
00:24:25,884 --> 00:24:27,079
and that's where I went.

530
00:24:27,146 --> 00:24:29,037
And, uh, you encountered
the robbers.

531
00:24:29,104 --> 00:24:30,400
Yes, sir.

532
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:32,258
Did you get a good look at them?

533
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:35,214
Not their faces.
They had masks on.

534
00:24:35,493 --> 00:24:38,681
Uh, h-he was kind of tall, uh,

535
00:24:39,453 --> 00:24:42,404
and she was a, uh... a she.

536
00:24:42,469 --> 00:24:43,396
Sort of like

537
00:24:43,461 --> 00:24:45,294
the two defendants,
seated over there?

538
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,508
Objection. Counsel
is testifying.

539
00:24:48,573 --> 00:24:49,766
Sustained.

540
00:24:52,565 --> 00:24:53,672
Hi.

541
00:24:55,414 --> 00:24:57,181
M-Mr. Greene?

542
00:24:58,023 --> 00:24:59,627
She's my Clairey.

543
00:25:00,117 --> 00:25:03,353
Works in the store.
She's a lifesaver.

544
00:25:07,102 --> 00:25:08,923
Let's just call
for a verdict right now.

545
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,443
Easy, big boy.

546
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:11,798
It ain't over till it's over,

547
00:25:11,867 --> 00:25:13,860
- and this one's barely begun.
- Excuse me.

548
00:25:13,927 --> 00:25:15,912
No one asked you.
If I want to hear the truth,

549
00:25:15,977 --> 00:25:17,705
I'll go out into the hall
and talk to myself.

550
00:25:17,805 --> 00:25:19,845
So you confronted
the robbers.

551
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:21,302
I sure did.

552
00:25:21,555 --> 00:25:23,353
And the tall one
confronted me.

553
00:25:23,425 --> 00:25:25,720
Took his gun and he started
hitting me in the head.

554
00:25:26,977 --> 00:25:28,388
Uh, and then I fell down,

555
00:25:28,453 --> 00:25:30,314
and-and then,
I must've passed out.

556
00:25:30,474 --> 00:25:34,083
Is... I-Is there
anything else you remember

557
00:25:34,148 --> 00:25:37,240
that happened prior to you
losing consciousness?

558
00:25:37,305 --> 00:25:39,760
One thing.
I heard the woman say something.

559
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:41,673
What did she say?

560
00:25:42,812 --> 00:25:46,517
She said, "Randy, stop it."

561
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,087
You're killing him."

562
00:25:49,367 --> 00:25:50,539
"Randy."

563
00:25:50,696 --> 00:25:53,673
Are you positive that's
what she called him?

564
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:55,148
Oh, yeah.

565
00:25:55,699 --> 00:25:58,517
100%. Randy.

566
00:26:04,194 --> 00:26:06,291
I am so sorry, Bull.

567
00:26:06,468 --> 00:26:07,929
It's that good, huh?

568
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,798
"Sea of red"
doesn't even get it done.

569
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,962
What did I just tell you
about the truth?

570
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:27,320
Excuse me.

571
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:29,121
Could you drop me off first?

572
00:26:29,898 --> 00:26:31,791
Switch seats with me.

573
00:26:32,594 --> 00:26:34,236
Switch seats with me.
Come on.

574
00:26:34,363 --> 00:26:36,857
Call me crazy,
but I sense some antagonism

575
00:26:36,922 --> 00:26:38,728
here in the back seat.

576
00:26:39,513 --> 00:26:42,983
- Randy. Isn't that your client's name?
- "Hmm?

577
00:26:43,048 --> 00:26:45,634
Apparently, that was one
of the burglar's names.

578
00:26:45,709 --> 00:26:47,787
Well, thank goodness
all this anger isn't personal.

579
00:26:47,852 --> 00:26:49,595
Ha, well, it's a
little personal.

580
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:50,990
I can take the subway.

581
00:26:51,055 --> 00:26:52,720
You know, lots of people
are named Randy.

582
00:26:52,817 --> 00:26:54,818
I can attest to that.
And we have no way

583
00:26:54,883 --> 00:26:55,957
of knowing if the Randy.

584
00:26:56,022 --> 00:26:57,982
Mr. Greene thinks he heard
referred to is our Randy.

585
00:26:58,047 --> 00:26:59,547
Could be
a whole different Randy.

586
00:26:59,623 --> 00:27:01,986
Could even have been
"Andy," or "Sandy."

587
00:27:02,118 --> 00:27:03,755
- He makes an excellent point.
- Sometimes the people

588
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,572
you think are Randy
aren't.

589
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,317
Don't I know it.

590
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:12,744
I can take the subway.

591
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,638
Benny could cross-examine
Mr. Greene tomorrow morning.

592
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:19,091
We already know he's forgetful.

593
00:27:19,156 --> 00:27:21,127
It wouldn't be very difficult
to convince the jury

594
00:27:21,192 --> 00:27:23,497
that he is a less than
reliable witness.

595
00:27:23,562 --> 00:27:25,427
My client would have
a serious issue with that,

596
00:27:25,492 --> 00:27:26,583
thank you very much.

597
00:27:26,648 --> 00:27:27,923
She loves Mr. Greene,
and thinks

598
00:27:27,988 --> 00:27:30,087
that he has been through
enough.

599
00:27:30,528 --> 00:27:33,121
Excuse me, you can
drop me off right here.

600
00:27:36,695 --> 00:27:38,720
I'll see you in the morning,
Benny.

601
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:48,759
Seriously, I could
take the subway.

602
00:27:49,374 --> 00:27:50,748
Your scars look good.

603
00:27:50,855 --> 00:27:52,741
Your heart sounds good.

604
00:27:52,987 --> 00:27:55,751
I'm gonna give you
the name of my stylist,

605
00:27:55,868 --> 00:27:59,157
see if he can do something fun
with your unruly chest hair.

606
00:27:59,452 --> 00:28:02,843
But first, why don't you
tell me what spooked you

607
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,352
so bad that you had to see me
at 7:00 in the morning?

608
00:28:05,478 --> 00:28:07,190
You get lightheaded
in the gym?

609
00:28:07,523 --> 00:28:08,837
Short of breath
walking to work?

610
00:28:08,902 --> 00:28:10,668
Actually, I was with a woman
the other night...

611
00:28:10,765 --> 00:28:12,157
Ah, I'm thrilled
for you.

612
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,970
She and I have known each other
for a long time.

613
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:17,813
And one thing led to another...

614
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:19,622
And...? And my heart

615
00:28:19,687 --> 00:28:22,259
- started to pound.
- Okay.

616
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,087
Is it supposed to do that?

617
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:27,498
It depends. How excited were you
to be with this woman?

618
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,528
Does she know
about your history?

619
00:28:30,593 --> 00:28:32,024
What you've been through
this past year?

620
00:28:32,189 --> 00:28:34,485
Your operation was...

621
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,249
last May.

622
00:28:36,327 --> 00:28:39,759
I'm assuming that you've been
in this situation prior to this?

623
00:28:41,732 --> 00:28:43,630
Or... maybe not?

624
00:28:43,695 --> 00:28:47,309
Any particular reason?
I mean, religion, pain

625
00:28:47,374 --> 00:28:48,946
or something
that I should know about?

626
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,962
I've certainly thought
about it.

627
00:28:52,177 --> 00:28:55,645
You know, it's not unusual for
men who suffer a cardiac arrest

628
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,696
to shy away
from intimacy,

629
00:28:58,826 --> 00:29:01,215
and convince themselves
that in all the excitement,

630
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,149
they might give themselves
another heart attack.

631
00:29:04,226 --> 00:29:06,360
You're saying that
like it's not the case.

632
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:08,872
You're in better shape now than
in all the time I've known you.

633
00:29:08,937 --> 00:29:10,955
The problem is not
with your heart.

634
00:29:11,141 --> 00:29:12,309
The problem's in your head,

635
00:29:12,374 --> 00:29:15,501
said the heart surgeon
to the head doctor.

636
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:20,126
You like this woman?
You trust this woman?

637
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:21,856
Tell her your history.

638
00:29:21,921 --> 00:29:26,724
Tell her what you're feeling,
and if she's still interested,

639
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:29,110
then you have nothing to fear.

640
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:32,098
What if you're wrong?

641
00:29:32,163 --> 00:29:36,243
Well, if I'm wrong, you die.

642
00:29:38,434 --> 00:29:40,017
But what a way to go.

643
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:46,188
We are not welcome.

644
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:50,872
Diana's client wanted some time
alone with her attorney.

645
00:29:50,937 --> 00:29:53,299
- Where's Randy?
- Guard took him to court.

646
00:29:53,364 --> 00:29:55,042
I've been standing
here waiting for you.

647
00:29:55,172 --> 00:29:57,106
I couldn't help but
sense a little something

648
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:58,840
in the car last night.

649
00:29:59,054 --> 00:30:01,110
Is our alliance here
starting to fall apart?

650
00:30:01,296 --> 00:30:02,540
I have no idea.

651
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:05,008
But I'd love to know what
they're talking about in there.

652
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,426
Do you remember yesterday,

653
00:30:06,491 --> 00:30:09,040
when Randy said he hadn't seen
his hat since Thailand?

654
00:30:09,312 --> 00:30:10,656
Sure.

655
00:30:13,781 --> 00:30:17,149
He wore it
onto the plane home.

656
00:30:18,326 --> 00:30:20,973
So he did have it here
in New York.

657
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:24,524
I don't know. All I know is that
he wore it onto the plane.

658
00:30:24,686 --> 00:30:27,465
I-I'm guessing he threw it into
his carry-on bag or something.

659
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,364
Do you think
maybe he just forgot?

660
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:30,923
That's why I'm talking to you,
Aunt Diana.

661
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,462
I don't know what to think.

662
00:30:32,718 --> 00:30:34,696
Okay, honey.
Okay...

663
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,251
I need you
both in the courtroom.

664
00:30:41,324 --> 00:30:42,954
The judge is about
to take the bench.

665
00:30:43,562 --> 00:30:44,773
All right.

666
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,099
Are you ready?

667
00:30:48,703 --> 00:30:51,602
Prosecution calls
Jacqueline Stone to the stand.

668
00:30:53,877 --> 00:30:55,595
Uh, objection.

669
00:30:55,843 --> 00:30:59,372
Your Honor, we have no
knowledge of this witness.

670
00:30:59,437 --> 00:31:01,423
Neither did we
until last night.

671
00:31:01,781 --> 00:31:05,184
Witness can testify.
I'll give you time to prepare

672
00:31:05,249 --> 00:31:07,157
for cross-examination.

673
00:31:08,765 --> 00:31:10,137
Who is this woman?
Do you know her?

674
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,637
- Ask Randy.
- She's my ex-girlfriend.

675
00:31:12,702 --> 00:31:14,298
Ex-fiancée.

676
00:31:16,138 --> 00:31:18,337
I dated him
for almost two years,

677
00:31:18,415 --> 00:31:20,423
and then we decided
to get married.

678
00:31:20,698 --> 00:31:21,936
What happened?

679
00:31:22,042 --> 00:31:23,743
You'd have to ask him.

680
00:31:24,673 --> 00:31:28,524
He texted me, said something
just didn't feel right.

681
00:31:28,999 --> 00:31:30,007
Wow.

682
00:31:30,085 --> 00:31:32,524
You talk to him after that?
Not for a long time.

683
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:33,989
But you heard from him recently?

684
00:31:34,054 --> 00:31:37,360
Yes, uh, he's actually
been calling a lot lately.

685
00:31:40,489 --> 00:31:41,739
I'm guessing you know

686
00:31:41,804 --> 00:31:43,192
what's going on over here.

687
00:31:43,257 --> 00:31:44,936
You don't need
to say anything.

688
00:31:45,393 --> 00:31:47,446
I can actually feel the love.

689
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,688
Any reason
in particular?

690
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:52,673
He wanted his
engagement ring back.

691
00:31:52,917 --> 00:31:55,161
He said it was his
grandmother's. I told him that

692
00:31:55,226 --> 00:31:57,372
if he wanted it back,
he could come to my place

693
00:31:57,437 --> 00:31:58,884
one night and pick it up.

694
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:01,481
See that?
Oh ye of little faith.

695
00:32:01,546 --> 00:32:03,227
He wanted the ring back
for Claire.

696
00:32:03,749 --> 00:32:06,676
And did he? Did he come
to your place?

697
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:09,438
He did, around midnight.

698
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,899
We hung out for a while.

699
00:32:13,614 --> 00:32:15,517
Talked about old times.

700
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,536
Look, I'm not given to panic,

701
00:32:19,601 --> 00:32:21,659
but if she starts testifying
that they slept together,

702
00:32:21,724 --> 00:32:23,556
I need you to call in
a bomb threat.

703
00:32:24,747 --> 00:32:26,196
And then what happened?

704
00:32:26,432 --> 00:32:28,938
He told me that
he met someone.

705
00:32:29,691 --> 00:32:32,220
Told me that was why
he wanted the ring back.

706
00:32:33,147 --> 00:32:34,192
I got upset.

707
00:32:34,257 --> 00:32:36,962
I told him he was never
getting it back, and he left.

708
00:32:39,143 --> 00:32:40,563
Your Honor...

709
00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:43,064
Okay. We lived.

710
00:32:43,647 --> 00:32:46,087
Honestly? That was
a whole lot of nothing.

711
00:32:47,693 --> 00:32:49,320
Um...

712
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,618
one last question.

713
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:55,681
Do you recall
what night this was?

714
00:32:56,649 --> 00:32:58,284
The night Randy came by?

715
00:32:58,921 --> 00:33:00,727
Uh, December 6th.

716
00:33:01,781 --> 00:33:02,825
That's the same night

717
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,161
the jewelry store
was burglarized.

718
00:33:04,226 --> 00:33:07,450
So if the defendants
were to tell the police

719
00:33:07,515 --> 00:33:09,907
that they were home
that night sleeping,

720
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,556
they'd be lying, wouldn't they?

721
00:33:12,648 --> 00:33:15,595
Well, they'd be lying
about Randy, that's for sure.

722
00:33:15,941 --> 00:33:17,942
And if you don't believe me,
you can ask the doorman

723
00:33:18,007 --> 00:33:20,548
at my building.
He let Randy in and out.

724
00:33:25,181 --> 00:33:26,665
No further questions.

725
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,551
Okay, let's just call
for a recess.

726
00:33:29,616 --> 00:33:30,761
That'll give us
enough time to...

727
00:33:30,826 --> 00:33:32,649
Cross-examination,
Your Honor?

728
00:33:32,858 --> 00:33:34,656
Oh, I thought your team
would want time

729
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,571
to prepare for cross,
but by all means.

730
00:33:39,403 --> 00:33:40,815
Just to be clear,

731
00:33:41,171 --> 00:33:43,583
you're testifying that
at the night of the burglary,

732
00:33:43,648 --> 00:33:45,757
you and Mr. Markes
were together.

733
00:33:46,769 --> 00:33:48,312
You and Mr. Markes.

734
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:52,700
So you don't actually know
the whereabouts of my client,

735
00:33:52,765 --> 00:33:55,595
- do you?
- What is she doing? Objection!

736
00:33:57,109 --> 00:33:58,374
Grounds?

737
00:34:00,861 --> 00:34:02,327
Withdrawn.

738
00:34:04,441 --> 00:34:07,295
What do you know, "backstabbing"
isn't grounds for objection.

739
00:34:08,554 --> 00:34:10,024
You're a woman, aren't you?

740
00:34:11,066 --> 00:34:12,356
Last I checked.

741
00:34:12,421 --> 00:34:15,009
And you're roughly
my client's height and build.

742
00:34:15,122 --> 00:34:17,696
Well, maybe Randy has a type.
Maybe.

743
00:34:18,898 --> 00:34:21,782
Or maybe it was you he was with
the night of the burglary.

744
00:34:21,867 --> 00:34:22,851
Excuse me?

745
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:25,608
Objection, Your Honor.
The witness is not on trial.

746
00:34:25,771 --> 00:34:28,751
Sustained. Jury will ignore
the question.

747
00:34:28,998 --> 00:34:32,399
Withdrawn. No further questions,
Your Honor.

748
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:44,718
Some team.

749
00:34:45,478 --> 00:34:48,317
Some alliance. Some partnership.

750
00:34:48,382 --> 00:34:51,290
Hey, I didn't call Randy's ex
to the stand.

751
00:34:51,666 --> 00:34:53,700
That was as much of a surprise
to me as it was to you.

752
00:34:53,765 --> 00:34:55,618
So you just figured,
what the hell,

753
00:34:55,692 --> 00:34:58,364
we'll just throw him under
the bus in front of the jury?

754
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,536
You're damn right I did.
That man is a liar.

755
00:35:00,601 --> 00:35:01,452
Excuse me?

756
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,860
He's been lying to us.

757
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:07,056
He's been lying to me.

758
00:35:08,034 --> 00:35:11,395
You left me in the middle of the
night to go see your ex-fiancée?

759
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,613
For the ring.
I wanted to give you the ring.

760
00:35:14,929 --> 00:35:16,512
But why not tell me?

761
00:35:16,577 --> 00:35:19,762
To protect you.
To protect your feelings.

762
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:21,646
I didn't want you to be upset.

763
00:35:21,711 --> 00:35:24,543
Okay, good plan.
What about the hat?

764
00:35:24,608 --> 00:35:26,113
What are you talking about?

765
00:35:26,865 --> 00:35:28,833
You told everyone in this room

766
00:35:28,898 --> 00:35:30,614
that you lost your hat
in Thailand,

767
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:32,028
but you know damn well
that you were

768
00:35:32,093 --> 00:35:33,696
wearing the hat
onto the plane home.

769
00:35:35,899 --> 00:35:37,124
Was I?

770
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:41,663
Oh. Yeah.

771
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:43,837
So you had it
here in New York?

772
00:35:44,437 --> 00:35:47,071
Could someone have
stolen it from you?

773
00:35:47,327 --> 00:35:48,840
But I didn't have it
here in New York.

774
00:35:48,905 --> 00:35:50,884
I haven't seen it since...

775
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,868
I must've left it
in the overhead bin.

776
00:35:56,304 --> 00:35:58,196
I threw it up there.

777
00:35:58,662 --> 00:35:59,537
I was putting

778
00:35:59,602 --> 00:36:02,185
our bags up there. You were
on the phone with your aunt.

779
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,959
Then you were on the phone
with your boss...

780
00:36:04,024 --> 00:36:05,171
Mr. Greene?

781
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,959
Why were you on the phone
with your boss

782
00:36:08,024 --> 00:36:09,060
while you were
on your honeymoon?

783
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,021
He didn't know it was
going to be a honeymoon.

784
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,205
We didn't know it was
gonna be a honeymoon.

785
00:36:13,509 --> 00:36:16,326
I told you. He forgot
his combination to the safe,

786
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:17,224
so I gave him mine.

787
00:36:17,289 --> 00:36:19,893
When you say "gave him,"
you texted? You e-mailed?

788
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:22,537
We were still on the
ground, so I just...

789
00:36:22,651 --> 00:36:24,325
told him over the phone.

790
00:36:26,086 --> 00:36:27,289
Out loud?

791
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:29,092
Boy, I would
love to know

792
00:36:29,157 --> 00:36:30,911
who was sitting around you
when you were on that call.

793
00:36:30,976 --> 00:36:32,662
I know someone who might
be able to help us with that.

794
00:36:32,727 --> 00:36:33,896
See if you can talk
to the judge,

795
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:35,955
get us a continuance for a day.

796
00:36:37,082 --> 00:36:39,635
Marissa, is
Taylor around?

797
00:36:40,002 --> 00:36:42,802
Yeah, ask her if she can
find a way to access

798
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,685
the manifest from the Thailand

799
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,115
to New York flight that
Randy and Claire were on?

800
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,373
I need names,
addresses,

801
00:36:48,438 --> 00:36:50,963
and final destinations
of everyone seated around them.

802
00:36:51,315 --> 00:36:52,877
Mm-hmm.

803
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,554
Thank you.

804
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,806
You're welcome.

805
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:05,580
He has quite a record.

806
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,388
Breaking and entering, assault.

807
00:37:07,453 --> 00:37:08,861
He seemed so nice.

808
00:37:09,067 --> 00:37:12,439
So you're guessing he heard
the combination, memorized it.

809
00:37:12,953 --> 00:37:15,080
But how did he figure out
where Claire worked?

810
00:37:15,289 --> 00:37:17,535
Did he ever have access
to your phone?

811
00:37:19,618 --> 00:37:22,752
You couldn't find it when we
were getting off the plane.

812
00:37:23,594 --> 00:37:26,217
He must've grabbed it
when I was sleeping

813
00:37:26,282 --> 00:37:28,021
and then kicked it
down the aisle,

814
00:37:28,086 --> 00:37:29,217
so I wouldn't know
it was him.

815
00:37:29,282 --> 00:37:30,279
Grabbed your hat

816
00:37:30,344 --> 00:37:32,623
so he could drop it
at the scene and guarantee

817
00:37:32,688 --> 00:37:34,531
you two would
take the blame.

818
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,544
- Now all we have to do is find him.
- We're working on it.

819
00:37:37,721 --> 00:37:39,873
Did he tell you anything else
about himself?

820
00:37:39,972 --> 00:37:41,293
Anything at all?

821
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,114
Um, he mentioned
he'd been married.

822
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,180
Okay.

823
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:47,049
- Anything else?
- Um...

824
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:50,263
He didn't like my perfume.
Said he was allergic to it.

825
00:37:50,328 --> 00:37:51,838
What kind of perfume
were you wearing?

826
00:37:51,929 --> 00:37:53,650
Eau du Bonne Jeunesse.

827
00:38:03,121 --> 00:38:04,747
Our man is on the move.

828
00:38:05,386 --> 00:38:06,649
We'll alert the authorities.

829
00:38:06,714 --> 00:38:08,778
Just got word.
He's out of the apartment.

830
00:38:09,722 --> 00:38:11,223
Scotch. Neat.

831
00:38:15,525 --> 00:38:17,334
Cup of coffee, please.

832
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:24,183
Bless you.

833
00:38:24,323 --> 00:38:27,754
That came out of nowhere.
Uh, excuse me. So sorry.

834
00:38:27,945 --> 00:38:30,067
No need apologize.
In fact,

835
00:38:31,511 --> 00:38:33,434
it's probably my fault.

836
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:38,437
Eau du Bonne
Jeunesse.

837
00:38:38,784 --> 00:38:40,831
It's a gift
from a friend of yours.

838
00:38:40,898 --> 00:38:44,492
Said she sat next to you on a
plane from Thailand to New York.

839
00:38:45,813 --> 00:38:47,520
Bless you again,
Mr. McCall.

840
00:38:48,122 --> 00:38:50,512
Wait a second,
how do you know my name?

841
00:38:50,908 --> 00:38:54,061
Stephen McCall.
I had to give it to the police

842
00:38:54,128 --> 00:38:55,833
so they could execute
the search warrant.

843
00:38:56,597 --> 00:38:58,825
- Search warrant?
- Mm-hmm.

844
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,726
They've been at your house
for the last ten minutes.

845
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:06,254
Sounds like they might've
found something. Stolen goods,

846
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:08,036
that sort of thing.

847
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:11,434
Huh!
See that?

848
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,440
They did.

849
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:16,840
I'd stay in that seat
if I were you.

850
00:39:17,315 --> 00:39:18,919
Finish your drink.

851
00:39:19,433 --> 00:39:21,964
You're not gonna be having
one of those for a long time.

852
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:25,294
Besides, they already
picked up your accomplice,

853
00:39:25,722 --> 00:39:26,997
your ex-wife.

854
00:39:27,422 --> 00:39:28,926
She told them everything.

855
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:35,270
That's on me.

856
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,023
Is there any better sound
in the world

857
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,112
than when the judge says
"case dismissed"?

858
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:47,333
Not when you're representing
the accused

859
00:39:47,425 --> 00:39:49,489
and the accused
is someone you care about.

860
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:52,934
You think Claire and Randy
are gonna be okay?

861
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,403
You think they're gonna
be okay with me?

862
00:39:56,941 --> 00:39:59,016
I really misjudged Randy.

863
00:39:59,081 --> 00:40:02,608
Well, I'm no expert,
but from my vantage point,

864
00:40:02,823 --> 00:40:04,774
it looked like they
couldn't wait to get home

865
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:05,992
and resume their honeymoon.

866
00:40:06,057 --> 00:40:08,051
I think he knows you were
just doing your job,

867
00:40:08,644 --> 00:40:12,426
as a lawyer
and as an aunt.

868
00:40:13,147 --> 00:40:14,825
Oh, this is me.

869
00:40:15,388 --> 00:40:18,856
As always, a pleasure,
Diana.

870
00:40:19,323 --> 00:40:20,801
Safe travels.

871
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:23,590
- Take care, Benny.
- All right.

872
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:27,448
Bye.

873
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:38,502
I have no idea what I'm gonna do
for the rest of my day.

874
00:40:38,567 --> 00:40:40,263
Hmm.

875
00:40:41,975 --> 00:40:44,233
I'm not really
good alone.

876
00:40:45,348 --> 00:40:47,717
Funny you should
mention that.

877
00:40:48,731 --> 00:40:50,561
You want to
get a drink?

878
00:40:51,594 --> 00:40:53,733
I would love
to get a drink.

879
00:40:57,541 --> 00:40:59,830
Oh. Baby,
the bar's over there.

880
00:40:59,895 --> 00:41:00,847
Yeah.

881
00:41:04,377 --> 00:41:05,838
Thing is...

882
00:41:06,825 --> 00:41:11,241
I'm actually trying
not to drink.

883
00:41:12,715 --> 00:41:14,327
You okay with that?

884
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:17,888
Sure.

885
00:41:19,957 --> 00:41:21,994
Thing is, back in May,

886
00:41:22,059 --> 00:41:24,772
I-I had this... thing.

887
00:41:24,934 --> 00:41:26,348
Uh...

888
00:41:28,614 --> 00:41:30,007
I'll tell you about it later.

889
00:41:30,072 --> 00:41:32,366
- You don't have to.
- I want to.

890
00:41:33,364 --> 00:41:34,677
Okay.

891
00:41:40,795 --> 00:41:44,359
Well... if we're not gonna
go to the bar,

892
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:47,008
what would you like to do?

893
00:41:47,958 --> 00:41:50,065
Well, to be honest,
I'd like to go back up to your room

894
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:51,683
and listen to you read
your opening statement

895
00:41:51,748 --> 00:41:53,248
to the jury again.

896
00:41:53,841 --> 00:41:55,437
I should slap you.

897
00:41:55,608 --> 00:41:58,424
Patience.
I'm sure we'll get to all of that.

898
00:41:58,491 --> 00:42:00,117
Well, thank goodness.

899
00:42:00,397 --> 00:42:02,328
Now where are
those elevators?

900
00:42:05,047 --> 00:42:06,235
<i>♪ Let's stay together ... ♪</i>

901
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,175
So what's this thing
that happened to you?

902
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,574
Oh, patience.
Your flight's not till tomorrow.

903
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:11,910
I'm sure we'll get to it.

904
00:42:11,975 --> 00:42:14,210
<i>♪ I...</i>

905
00:42:14,803 --> 00:42:18,037
<i>♪ I'm so in love with you. ♪</i>

905
00:42:19,305 --> 00:43:19,784

13
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:40,914
Hi, Mo.

14
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:42,375
Morning. Quick question.

15
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,921
Do you always have to play and
sing your music quite that loud?

16
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:47,846
Well, how else am I
supposed to listen to Wham!?

17
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:49,392
Their songs demand a certain level

18
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:50,953
of participation and volume.

19
00:00:50,978 --> 00:00:53,289
It's just that I have a
huge day at work today,

20
00:00:53,314 --> 00:00:54,836
and that sound booming through my walls

21
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,227
wasn't really the best way to start it.

22
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:57,650
Know what I mean?

23
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,334
Why are you up so early, anyway?

24
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,578
Oh, I didn't go to bed.

25
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,374
At midnight, I had this idea
for a whole line of caftans,

26
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:05,865
and, you know,
when inspiration strikes...

27
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:07,901
Hey, what music are you listening to?

28
00:01:07,903 --> 00:01:09,736
I'm happy to take requests
for the next time.

29
00:01:09,738 --> 00:01:11,838
Sorry. You wouldn't know the band.

30
00:01:12,054 --> 00:01:13,673
<i>On today's "Analog Dialogue,"</i>

31
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:16,031
<i>we have M.I.T. Fellow
and robotics specialist,</i>

32
00:01:16,056 --> 00:01:19,117
<i>Dr. Grace Simmons Hartley,
discussing her...</i>

33
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:24,695
So, you ready for this?

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,430
I think so. I mean,
I do have a pounding headache

35
00:01:27,455 --> 00:01:29,625
and a teeny bit of vomit
in the back of my throat,

36
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,475
- but, like, in a good way.
- Okay.

37
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,435
I just really don't
want to screw this up.

38
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,351
- Next!
- I will have a nonfat latte.

39
00:01:36,376 --> 00:01:38,443
And I'll have a coffee, black.

40
00:01:38,726 --> 00:01:40,771
Keeping it lean for the ladies.

41
00:01:40,796 --> 00:01:43,021
It actually says that
on his dating profile.

42
00:01:43,046 --> 00:01:44,437
It does.

43
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,406
I still don't think it's right for Joan

44
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:47,969
to force us all to go
after this promotion.

45
00:01:47,993 --> 00:01:50,625
We're not all management material,
and I'm fine with that.

46
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,453
I'm not. I've been a coder long enough.

47
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:54,553
I need to expand my horizons.

48
00:01:54,578 --> 00:01:55,750
Ooh, that's good.

49
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:57,282
And then you should tell
her how you crushed it

50
00:01:57,306 --> 00:01:59,235
designing the interface for
our new photo-sharing app.

51
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:01,598
Except that was really
more of a group effort.

52
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:03,085
No, it was not a group effort.

53
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,748
It was literally all you.

54
00:02:04,773 --> 00:02:06,593
Now is not the time to be modest.

55
00:02:06,595 --> 00:02:08,595
Joan would be lucky to
have you managing the team,

56
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,765
but you're gonna have to convince her.

57
00:02:11,287 --> 00:02:12,804
Just don't let her rattle you.

58
00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:15,296
Stay confident.
Try to compliment her a little bit,

59
00:02:15,321 --> 00:02:17,406
because let's face it,
the woman's a narcissist.

60
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:19,718
All very good and thorough advice.

61
00:02:21,554 --> 00:02:23,437
- Hey.
- Howdy.

62
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,718
Did you just say,
"Howdy," to the new guy?

63
00:02:26,743 --> 00:02:29,281
That, I did. I don't know why
we need to keep reliving it.

64
00:02:29,306 --> 00:02:30,726
Why don't you just talk to him?

65
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,437
I'm sure he's perfectly nice.

66
00:02:32,462 --> 00:02:35,390
I'm sure he is, too,
but I have a long history of...

67
00:02:35,415 --> 00:02:37,126
What do you call my past
relationships again?

68
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,336
Unnecessarily complicated,
exhausting for everybody,

69
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:40,560
the opposite of good.

70
00:02:40,562 --> 00:02:41,960
Yeah, those things.

71
00:02:41,985 --> 00:02:45,326
Which is why, this time,
I'm gonna just take things slow

72
00:02:45,351 --> 00:02:46,537
and wait for the right in.

73
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:48,092
How does she look?

74
00:02:48,117 --> 00:02:49,469
Good mood or bad mood?

75
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:51,140
Uh, I'm gonna say all the moods.

76
00:02:51,165 --> 00:02:53,031
Your guess is as good as mine.

77
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,454
Okay.

78
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,978
Okay, look at me.

79
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,780
This is it. Work your magic.

80
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:02,882
Feel the glory. In it to win it.

81
00:03:04,732 --> 00:03:06,164
I don't know why I'm nervous.

82
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:08,423
So, Zoey, tell me why you think

83
00:03:08,448 --> 00:03:10,767
you're manager of engineering material.

84
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:12,492
Great question, Joan.

85
00:03:13,243 --> 00:03:15,454
To start with, I think that I proved
my programming skills

86
00:03:15,478 --> 00:03:17,569
when I helped design the interface
for our photo-sharing app.

87
00:03:17,593 --> 00:03:18,965
Okay, but how much of your work

88
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:21,187
personally contributed to that project?

89
00:03:21,515 --> 00:03:23,980
- You want, like, a percentage?
- No, I want a latte.

90
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:25,804
Yes, I want to know how
significant you feel

91
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:28,623
your contribution was in
terms of the end results.

92
00:03:28,648 --> 00:03:31,398
Well, I mean,
it was definitely a group effort,

93
00:03:31,423 --> 00:03:34,014
but if I had to give
you a concrete number,

94
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:37,539
I guess I would say... six.

95
00:03:37,564 --> 00:03:38,764
Six?

96
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:40,156
- ... ty...
- 60?

97
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:41,905
- ... four?
- 64%?

98
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,129
Correct.

99
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:46,828
Technical accomplishments aside,

100
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:48,919
what makes you think you
would be a good manager?

101
00:03:48,944 --> 00:03:50,765
Are you an effective communicator?

102
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,766
Do you think you can get
others to follow your lead?

103
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,976
Are you comfortable being the bad guy?

104
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,373
Well, I'm not really
comfortable with anything.

105
00:03:58,398 --> 00:03:59,882
That's why I became a coder.

106
00:04:03,215 --> 00:04:05,549
But that doesn't mean I
couldn't be a great manager

107
00:04:05,574 --> 00:04:07,382
if given the chance.

108
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,334
What are you typing?

109
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:11,951
My Pilates instructor.

110
00:04:11,953 --> 00:04:13,656
Can't be late again, Jeff.

111
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:20,068
Leif, you've been summoned.

112
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,320
How'd you do?

113
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:24,257
I'm gonna go out on a
limb and say not well.

114
00:04:24,282 --> 00:04:26,776
Really? I thought you two
would be doing each other's nails

115
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:29,053
and buying matching tote
bags off Etsy in there.

116
00:04:29,078 --> 00:04:31,084
Dude, come on. Not cool.

117
00:04:31,109 --> 00:04:33,443
What? What?

118
00:04:33,468 --> 00:04:34,640
I'm sorry.

119
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:36,776
Yeah, me, too. I was really hoping

120
00:04:36,801 --> 00:04:39,125
I'd have some good
news to tell my father.

121
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,129
All right, who wants
some freshly delivered,

122
00:04:56,131 --> 00:04:57,986
slightly cold, mediocre pizza?

123
00:04:58,011 --> 00:04:59,398
Mom? Zoey?

124
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,433
Maybe later.

125
00:05:00,435 --> 00:05:02,871
All right. Well, more for me.

126
00:05:05,535 --> 00:05:08,019
Mom, let me take over. You need a break.

127
00:05:08,044 --> 00:05:10,053
No, that's not why we
have you guys here.

128
00:05:10,078 --> 00:05:11,621
We just like the company.

129
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:14,057
Okay. Well, I can still feed Dad soup.

130
00:05:14,082 --> 00:05:16,048
Yes, but your father doesn't want

131
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,050
to burden you with any of this stuff.

132
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:22,564
How do you know? He can't speak.

133
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:23,920
Well, I don't know for sure,

134
00:05:23,922 --> 00:05:26,556
but I have been married
to the man for 40 years,

135
00:05:26,558 --> 00:05:29,299
so I have a pretty good idea.

136
00:05:29,324 --> 00:05:31,252
Can we maybe open a window or something?

137
00:05:31,277 --> 00:05:33,387
Why? You want Dad to catch
a cold on top of everything else?

138
00:05:33,411 --> 00:05:35,409
Yeah, that's exactly
what I want for him.

139
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:36,599
- Guys.
- He just always loved

140
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:37,834
being outside, and I don't know.

141
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:39,002
I thought maybe a little fresh air...

142
00:05:39,004 --> 00:05:40,730
Might give him pneumonia?

143
00:05:41,312 --> 00:05:42,886
He's fine, Zoey.

144
00:05:46,886 --> 00:05:49,182
What's the matter, sweetie? You okay?

145
00:05:49,207 --> 00:05:51,514
Yeah, I've just been getting headaches

146
00:05:51,516 --> 00:05:53,783
and maybe a little bit
of eye pain lately.

147
00:05:53,785 --> 00:05:55,371
I'm sure it's nothing.

148
00:05:55,566 --> 00:05:57,033
Oh, so you're not thinking

149
00:05:57,058 --> 00:05:59,432
that you have what your father has?

150
00:05:59,457 --> 00:06:01,863
I mean, it might have crossed
my mind once or twice.

151
00:06:01,888 --> 00:06:04,504
He didn't show symptoms
until about a year ago,

152
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:06,596
and it started with balance issues

153
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:09,418
and speech problems,
not stress headaches.

154
00:06:09,443 --> 00:06:12,410
But, if you're really worried,
go see a doctor, and get an MRI.

155
00:06:12,435 --> 00:06:14,548
No way.
You know how claustrophobic I am.

156
00:06:14,573 --> 00:06:16,106
Well, so is your father,

157
00:06:16,108 --> 00:06:19,506
and he's had seven since January.

158
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:22,066
Three more,
we get a set of steak knives.

159
00:06:24,254 --> 00:06:26,054
They're not that scary.

160
00:06:29,334 --> 00:06:31,761
Are you sure this isn't
an elaborate teleportation device

161
00:06:31,786 --> 00:06:33,754

Because I love that song,

00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:21,741
So you weren't just singing
that to me specifically?

Why would I be singing to you?
You don't even like me.

People are singing to me, Mo.

273
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,450
An entire neighborhood just
sang a whole Beatles song to me.

274
00:12:57,475 --> 00:12:58,977
Quick question.

275
00:12:59,002 --> 00:13:01,524
Did you recently imbibe
or ingest anything

276
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:03,298
that came from a "medicinal" type shop?

277
00:13:03,323 --> 00:13:04,958
No. All I know is that, one second,

278
00:13:04,983 --> 00:13:06,361
I'm getting an MRI,
and, the next second...

279
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,119
Complete strangers are
singing John Lennon to you.

280
00:13:08,143 --> 00:13:10,477
Some to me, some to themselves,

281
00:13:10,743 --> 00:13:12,321
almost as if they were singing

282
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:14,457
what they were all thinking out loud

283
00:13:14,482 --> 00:13:16,860

284
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,259
Does that make sense?

285
00:13:19,284 --> 00:13:21,597
No, but I'm an open-minded person.

286
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:23,448
I'm willing to roll with this.

287
00:13:23,914 --> 00:13:26,980
Maybe you're operating on
a higher plane than the rest of us.

288
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:29,722
Maybe you're getting a special glimpse
into other people's heads.

289
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:31,221
If that's the case,

290
00:13:31,246 --> 00:13:32,966
then why aren't you
singing to me right now?

291

Child, I'm completely baked.

Ain't nothing going on

295
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:44,181
I shouldn't have told you.
I shouldn't tell anyone.

298

00:14:43,615 --> 00:14:45,715
Seriously, what is wrong with you?

320
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:47,082
My mom left me when I was young,

321
00:14:47,107 --> 00:14:48,544
and my whole life has been
a series of rejections

322
00:14:48,568 --> 00:14:51,920
from the opposite sex.
Any other questions?

323
00:14:51,945 --> 00:14:54,746
Yes, I have many, many questions.

324
00:14:58,995 --> 00:15:00,628
_

325
00:15:00,653 --> 00:15:02,098
For those of you who don't know,

326
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,767
we have recently discovered
a bug in the health app

327
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:06,769
that's supposed to launch in five days

328
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:08,651
along with the new Sprq Point watch.

329
00:15:08,676 --> 00:15:09,692
What's the bug doing?

330
00:15:09,717 --> 00:15:11,905
It's giving inaccurate readings
of people's blood pressure,

331
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:13,638
most in the range of 50 over 20.

332
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,588
That's low, isn't it?

333
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:18,113
Only if should no
longer be living is low.

334
00:15:18,138 --> 00:15:19,982
So, I'm gonna need you guys

335
00:15:19,984 --> 00:15:22,551
to text your friends and
your Adderall dealers

336
00:15:22,553 --> 00:15:24,240
and all the other entitled millennials

337
00:15:24,265 --> 00:15:26,326
you've been chatting with
on Slack and tell them

338
00:15:26,351 --> 00:15:27,982
you're gonna be in for some late nights.

339
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:29,349
Get to work.

340
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:36,609
I don't think it's coming from our end.

341
00:15:36,634 --> 00:15:39,168
- Our app code seems fine.
- Must have something to do

342
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,740
with how the watch itself
is recording the data.

343
00:15:41,765 --> 00:15:43,943
I'm gonna clone its firmware repository.

344
00:15:43,968 --> 00:15:46,326
- I can help if you want.
- Thanks, Leif.

Come on, people!
Let's party like it's 1978!

369
00:18:00,606 --> 00:18:02,206
You actually came to my gig.

370
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,035
You told me to tell
you if happens again.

371
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,144
All day, nothing, and then,

372
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:08,252
out of nowhere, it happened again.

373
00:18:08,277 --> 00:18:09,988
What now? A bunch of cartoon birds

374
00:18:10,013 --> 00:18:12,093
land on your shoulders and
sing show tunes to you?

375
00:18:12,118 --> 00:18:13,933
No, this was just one person

376
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:17,131
singing something so raw
and painful and personal,

377
00:18:17,156 --> 00:18:19,494
I almost felt embarrassed
listening to it.

378
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,891
What do you think that means?

379
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:22,363
One of two things,

380
00:18:22,388 --> 00:18:24,205
either your powers are getting stronger,

381
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:27,666
honing on specific targets,
or you're losing it,

382
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:29,496
in which case, I will do my civic duty

383
00:18:29,521 --> 00:18:31,445
and drive you to the nearest
mental health clinic

384
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,330
as soon as I'm finished making
seventies night my bitch.

385
00:18:34,355 --> 00:18:36,332
I am just very, very confused.

386
00:18:36,357 --> 00:18:39,186
You said that I was getting a glimpse
into other people's heads.

387
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:41,278
I said maybe you were,
and you should really take

388
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,145
everything I say when I'm
high with a grain of salt.

389
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:44,325
But it just doesn't make sense.

390
00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:46,794
The guy who was singing
is handsome and happy

391
00:18:46,819 --> 00:18:50,080
and charming and very, very sexy,

392
00:18:50,105 --> 00:18:52,082
and, if your theory is correct,

393
00:18:52,107 --> 00:18:54,674
then he should only be singing,
like, massively upbeat anthems

394
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:56,466
about how totally awesome he is.

395
00:18:56,491 --> 00:18:59,098
Well, maybe he's not quite
as awesome as you think he is.

396
00:18:59,123 --> 00:19:00,588
What was he singing?

397
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:02,551
I think it's called "Mad World."

398
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:05,776
Mm. Your boy is hurting.
That song is real dark.

399
00:19:05,801 --> 00:19:07,938
Look, songs are all just an expression

400
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,754
of our deepest wants and desires...

401
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:14,816
Joy, pain, heartbreak,
yearning, forgiveness, revenge.

402
00:19:14,841 --> 00:19:16,507
Good music can make you feel things

403
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:18,176
you can't express in words.

404
00:19:18,201 --> 00:19:22,163
So, if I do have this... power,

405
00:19:22,188 --> 00:19:24,035
maybe Simon really is hurting.

406
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,387
And the song that he sang only to you

407
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:28,512
might have been his cry for help.

408
00:19:28,537 --> 00:19:29,537
Hmm?

409
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:35,840
_

410
00:19:44,652 --> 00:19:47,277
I can't find anything.

411
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:49,471
No memory leak,
no out-of-bounds exception,

412
00:19:49,496 --> 00:19:51,191
not even a floating-point error.

413
00:19:51,216 --> 00:19:53,317
Hey, uh, not that I'm
keeping tabs or anything,

414
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:55,408
but that's like your
fourth cup of coffee today.

415
00:19:55,454 --> 00:19:57,020
How late were you here last night?

416
00:19:57,022 --> 00:19:58,285
Oh, I wasn't just here.

417
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,901
I went to this club
called The Make Out Place.

418
00:20:00,926 --> 00:20:03,246
You went to a club?

419
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:04,905
I'll be right back.

420
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,512
Okay.

421
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:08,957
Club. What's next, Burning Man?

422
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:26,902
What are you leaning towards?

423
00:20:27,871 --> 00:20:30,127
Tough call. Middle of the day.

424
00:20:30,152 --> 00:20:32,324
Do I get a sugar cereal
that'll make me crash hard

425
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:34,502
or something super healthy
that I'll totally hate?

426
00:20:34,527 --> 00:20:36,644
These are the struggles.

427
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:40,174
My dad's a huge fa...
Well, was a huge fan of granola.

428
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:42,441
I think I'm gonna go that route.

429
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:44,441
It's kinda the best of
both worlds scenario.

430
00:20:44,996 --> 00:20:46,558
What made your dad turn on granola?

431
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,645
Did granola hurt him in some way?

432
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:49,371
Rob his house? Make out with his lady?

433
00:20:49,396 --> 00:20:52,308
No. He just, uh, can't really swallow

434
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,707
anymore, because he's dying.

435
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:55,690
Well, slowly dying of this
rare neurological disease,

436
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:58,315
and each week, he, like,
loses another ability,

437
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,817
therefore, big chunks of granola

438
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:01,683
would just cause him to choke.

439
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:06,010
So, that's a whole lot of
TMI I just spewed at you.

440
00:21:06,035 --> 00:21:07,424
I-I'm sorry. I had no idea.

441
00:21:07,426 --> 00:21:08,505
Why would you? We're strangers.

442
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:09,606
There's no way you could know that,

443
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:10,966
just like there's no way I could know

444
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,973
if you were secretly
miserable or something.

445
00:21:12,998 --> 00:21:15,213
I mean, you seem happy, but who knows

446
00:21:15,238 --> 00:21:18,915
what other people
are really thinking, right?

447
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,478
Anyway, I'm Zoey.
I don't know if you know that,

448
00:21:21,503 --> 00:21:23,818
and, if you want to forget
this entire interaction

449
00:21:23,843 --> 00:21:26,335
ever happened, totally get it.

450
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,593
Zoey...

451
00:21:29,775 --> 00:21:31,348
we can do better than cereal.

452
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,697
You wanna take a walk?

453
00:21:33,204 --> 00:21:34,662
Yeah.

454
00:21:34,687 --> 00:21:36,720
You were right.

455
00:21:36,722 --> 00:21:39,323
This was the best
cheesecake I've ever had.

456
00:21:39,325 --> 00:21:41,126
Uh-uh, cheesequake.

457
00:21:41,151 --> 00:21:44,071
- Cheesequake.
- Ah.

458
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:46,707
Still, isn't it in
bad taste for a bakery

459
00:21:46,732 --> 00:21:48,799
to capitalize off natural disasters

460
00:21:48,801 --> 00:21:50,462
with a moderately clever pun?

461
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:51,679
Oh, definitely in bad taste,

462
00:21:51,704 --> 00:21:53,798
but, when they're as
good as these were...

463
00:21:53,823 --> 00:21:56,220
Unh... do we really care?

464
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:59,111
- No.
- Hmm.

465
00:22:01,702 --> 00:22:04,291
So, are you usually that honest

466
00:22:04,316 --> 00:22:06,579
about your dad and his condition?

467
00:22:06,604 --> 00:22:09,681
Not so much. I've found, in general,

468
00:22:09,706 --> 00:22:12,445
death and dying tend not to be
the best conversation starters.

469
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,958
Still, are you angry?
Are you crying all the time?

470
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,797
What's that whole process like for you?

471
00:22:16,822 --> 00:22:18,283
Why are you asking?

472
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,119
Is one of your parents dying, too?

473
00:22:21,144 --> 00:22:22,861
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

474
00:22:28,142 --> 00:22:29,173
If I show you something,

475
00:22:29,198 --> 00:22:31,236
can you promise to keep
it only between us?

476
00:22:37,108 --> 00:22:41,922
This is a photo of my dad
and I when I was a kid.

477
00:22:41,947 --> 00:22:44,329
I've been carrying it
everywhere I go lately.

478
00:22:45,302 --> 00:22:48,587
And you don't want others to
know about this, because...

479
00:22:48,612 --> 00:22:51,361
He killed himself, Zoey.

480
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:53,986
Five months ago.

481
00:22:54,011 --> 00:22:55,743
Looking at this photo

482
00:22:55,768 --> 00:22:57,534
is the only thing that
makes me feel better.

483
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,003
And I know what you're
going through sucks, but it's...

484
00:23:05,297 --> 00:23:07,264
it's way worse when they're gone.

485
00:23:07,547 --> 00:23:10,086
I mean, your dad's still here.
You gotta take advantage of that.

486
00:23:10,111 --> 00:23:11,748
Talk to him.

487
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,037
Hold his hand. Do things with him.

488
00:23:14,062 --> 00:23:16,396
'Cause, when he's gone, well, it's...

489
00:23:18,904 --> 00:23:23,283
Uh, this is the only thing
that I could hold on to.

490
00:23:25,413 --> 00:23:27,329
I'm so sorry.

491
00:23:30,603 --> 00:23:33,047
Are you talking to anyone about this?

492
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:35,564
Other than you? No.

493
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:39,219
I've become a real expert at
bottling my shame and pain

494
00:23:39,244 --> 00:23:41,431
and hiding it from the world.

495
00:23:42,858 --> 00:23:44,366
Listen,

496
00:23:44,391 --> 00:23:49,063
I'm not an expert on this or anything,

497
00:23:49,088 --> 00:23:51,343
but you can't just keep it in.

498
00:23:55,123 --> 00:23:59,306
We live in a very,
very mad world, Simon,

499
00:23:59,331 --> 00:24:02,032
but if you open up and express
what you're feeling to others,

500
00:24:02,034 --> 00:24:05,335
well, I mean, it's gotta be better

501
00:24:05,337 --> 00:24:07,022
than what you're doing now.

502
00:24:07,921 --> 00:24:09,640
Living your whole life in your head,

503
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:13,859
like this prison
my dad's now in, that's...

504
00:24:15,026 --> 00:24:16,351
... torture.

505
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:20,342
You're amazing.

506
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:23,382
It's like you know exactly
what's going on inside my brain.

507
00:24:26,602 --> 00:24:29,104
It's a real miracle
we found each other, Zoey.

508
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,760
Yeah.

509
00:24:32,496 --> 00:24:34,736
Such a miracle.

510
00:24:38,557 --> 00:24:41,446
These are all the pills Dad's taking?

511
00:24:41,471 --> 00:24:43,337
Yes. I had to make a spreadsheet

512
00:24:43,362 --> 00:24:45,666
just to keep track,
which pill, which hour.

513
00:24:45,691 --> 00:24:49,518
I-I could do a whole PowerPoint
presentation on this right now.

514
00:24:49,543 --> 00:24:51,494
You would be very impressed.

515
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:54,150
I'm just impressed
you know the term "PowerPoint."

516
00:24:54,175 --> 00:24:55,924
Well, what do they all do?

517
00:24:55,949 --> 00:24:59,186
Um, okay, well,
this one helped me sleep.

518
00:24:59,211 --> 00:25:01,127
This one made me forget all my problems

519
00:25:01,152 --> 00:25:02,588
for about five hours,

520
00:25:02,613 --> 00:25:03,628
- and this one...
- Mom, you've tried them?

521
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:06,011
No. Yes. Some of them.

522
00:25:07,317 --> 00:25:09,510
That is so unlike you.

523
00:25:09,535 --> 00:25:11,702
I know. I just...

524
00:25:11,786 --> 00:25:14,400
I wanted to feel what
your dad was feeling.

525
00:25:14,425 --> 00:25:16,058
That's all.

526
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:19,955
So, what is new with you?

527
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,041
Oh, nothing much.

528
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,721
Well, I left the office
in the middle of a crisis

529
00:25:25,746 --> 00:25:29,881
to spend time with this coworker
I have a massive crush on.

530
00:25:30,301 --> 00:25:31,721
Then I used information

531
00:25:31,746 --> 00:25:33,299
I shouldn't have even known about him

532
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:37,250
to form this bond like some
sort of adorable psycho.

533
00:25:37,275 --> 00:25:39,385
That is so unlike you.

534
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:42,291
I just haven't been myself lately,

535
00:25:42,899 --> 00:25:47,061
and I'm worried about you
and Dad all the time, and...

536
00:25:50,094 --> 00:25:51,720
What?

537
00:25:51,745 --> 00:25:53,330
What did I say?

538
00:25:57,746 --> 00:26:00,885
No, nothing. It's not you.

539
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,666
This is all just...

540
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:06,166
very overwhelming.

541
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:11,174
I mean, six months ago, Dad was...

542
00:26:11,573 --> 00:26:13,025
he was okay.

543
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:15,502
You know, we could still
communicate with each other,

544
00:26:15,527 --> 00:26:19,065
and now I don't know what's
going on in his head,

545
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:22,643
how much he's processing,
if he's processing.

546
00:26:23,612 --> 00:26:25,946
I should have been the
one this happened to.

547
00:26:25,971 --> 00:26:28,346
- Don't say that.
- No, it is true.

548
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:30,174
I mean, your dad was
always better than me

549
00:26:30,199 --> 00:26:33,104
at handling emergencies, all the...

550
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:36,471
emotional stuff, and we all know it.

551
00:26:36,496 --> 00:26:38,830
Okay, if that's the case,

552
00:26:38,855 --> 00:26:44,174
then maybe we should ask him how
to handle our current situation.

553
00:26:52,255 --> 00:26:56,090
I think we're just gonna have
to stumble through it together.

554
00:26:56,303 --> 00:26:58,096
The blind leading the blind.

555
00:26:58,121 --> 00:27:00,910
- Jinx.
- No take-backs.

556
00:27:06,214 --> 00:27:08,949
If you had the power to
know what was going on

557
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:13,877
in other people's heads,
do you think you'd feel guilty?

558
00:27:14,417 --> 00:27:17,347
No, I think I'd just get
my feelings hurt a lot more often.

559
00:27:17,372 --> 00:27:20,006
There she is, my favorite mind-reader.

560
00:27:21,408 --> 00:27:23,349
That's me...

561
00:27:23,374 --> 00:27:25,007
Zo-stradamus.

562
00:27:25,032 --> 00:27:28,136
I just wanted to say thank you
again for our talk yesterday,

563
00:27:28,161 --> 00:27:30,361
and I'm here for you, too,

564
00:27:30,386 --> 00:27:32,246
if you ever need someone to lean on.

565
00:27:32,271 --> 00:27:34,441
- I mean that.
- Great. Sounds good.

566
00:27:34,466 --> 00:27:35,910
Will definitely take you up on that.

567
00:27:35,935 --> 00:27:37,761
You know what?
I forgot a pencil at my desk,

568
00:27:37,786 --> 00:27:40,261
- so I have to excuse myself.
- Just one...

569
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:43,636
Uh, mind blown.

570
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:44,964
So many questions.

571
00:27:44,989 --> 00:27:46,355
How did that happen? What?

572
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,699
And did you really make
contact without telling me?

573
00:27:48,724 --> 00:27:51,722
We might have bonded on a deep,
emotional level.

574
00:27:51,747 --> 00:27:54,105
Zoey, got a minute?

575
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,527
Mm-hmm.

576
00:27:58,308 --> 00:27:59,371
Hi, Joan.

577
00:27:59,396 --> 00:28:01,012
I'm going to be
uncharacteristically honest

578
00:28:01,036 --> 00:28:02,598
with you right now.
Don't get used to it.

579
00:28:02,622 --> 00:28:04,156
You're one of the best
programmers we have,

580
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,769
which is why it's between you
and one other person for this job.

581
00:28:06,794 --> 00:28:09,230
- It is? That's...
- Meaningless, unless I pick you.

582
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:11,021
This is a big opportunity.

583
00:28:11,046 --> 00:28:12,412
Why did you leave work yesterday,

584
00:28:12,437 --> 00:28:14,613
and why are you so
distracted all of a sudden?

585
00:28:14,638 --> 00:28:17,231
- You noticed that?
- I notice everything.

586
00:28:17,415 --> 00:28:18,818
Maybe you don't want this promotion.

587
00:28:18,842 --> 00:28:21,208
No. Uh, I just have a lot going on.

588
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:23,044
That wasn't me looking for an answer.

589
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:26,356
That was me telling you to get
back to your desk and focus.

590
00:28:26,381 --> 00:28:27,647
Okay.

591
00:28:28,953 --> 00:28:32,247
Hey. So what was that all about?

592
00:28:32,272 --> 00:28:33,272
Nothing. She was just...

593
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:34,662
Was she giving you a clue about the bug?

594
00:28:34,686 --> 00:28:35,897
Does it have to do with our software

595
00:28:35,921 --> 00:28:37,822
or the watch's firmware?
At least tell us that much.

596
00:28:37,846 --> 00:28:39,740
- She didn't say anything.
- Are you sure? 'Cause it kinda

597
00:28:39,764 --> 00:28:42,044
seemed like she was giving
you some inside information.

598
00:28:42,069 --> 00:28:43,491
You know what I mean? Leaning in,

599
00:28:43,516 --> 00:28:45,013
breaking the glass ceiling.

600
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:46,671
A woman's place is in the house...

601
00:28:46,696 --> 00:28:48,013
and the Senate. What up?

602
00:28:48,038 --> 00:28:49,459
Okay, dude, come on.
You gotta stop trying

603
00:28:49,483 --> 00:28:51,848
to turn this into, like,
an us-versus-her thing.

604
00:28:51,873 --> 00:28:53,253
Okay? We're all in this together.

605
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:54,895
Fine.

606
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,154
Look, so, Zoey, no matter what happened,

607
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:00,356
whether Joan gave you some sort
of special advantage or not,

608
00:29:00,381 --> 00:29:01,653

00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,709
Glad to hear it.

00:30:18,711 --> 00:30:19,977
Yeah.

00:30:32,877 --> 00:30:34,343
Back so soon?

637
00:30:34,368 --> 00:30:36,352
I warned you.
Those things are addictive.

638
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:39,912
Hi. I was just about to call you.

639
00:30:39,937 --> 00:30:41,211
Is everything okay?

640
00:30:42,186 --> 00:30:43,352
Not really.

641
00:30:43,377 --> 00:30:45,469
I was hoping I could take you up

642
00:30:45,494 --> 00:30:48,727
on that whole leaning
on each other thing.

643
00:30:48,752 --> 00:30:50,548
Is right now a bad time?

644
00:30:50,573 --> 00:30:53,461
Babe, there you are.

645
00:30:54,488 --> 00:30:55,696
I hope you're stopping him

646
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:57,789
from buying any more of those things.

647
00:30:58,257 --> 00:30:59,736
He's so obsessed. He wants them to be

648
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,891
one of the dessert
options at the wedding.

649
00:31:02,368 --> 00:31:05,391
The wedding?

650
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:07,909
- This is my fiancée, Jessica.
- Hi.

651
00:31:07,934 --> 00:31:09,868
Uh, Zoey and I work with
each other at Sprq Point.

652
00:31:09,892 --> 00:31:12,633
- Oh.
- Not exactly work with each other.

653
00:31:12,658 --> 00:31:14,860
I'm just a coder,

654
00:31:14,885 --> 00:31:18,376
while your man's a big
old, fancy suit guy.

655
00:31:18,401 --> 00:31:20,067
We were just gonna go grab a bite.

656
00:31:20,069 --> 00:31:21,196
Do you want to join, or...

657
00:31:21,221 --> 00:31:22,653
Oh, no, no, that's okay. I can't.

658
00:31:22,678 --> 00:31:24,011
Maybe another time.

659
00:31:24,036 --> 00:31:26,103
Really nice to meet you.

660
00:31:26,128 --> 00:31:27,375
Have fun.

661
00:31:30,946 --> 00:31:32,579
She's so sweet.

662
00:31:42,186 --> 00:31:44,188
Hey, Dad.

663
00:31:44,213 --> 00:31:49,039
I'm, uh, going through a
little bit of a rough patch...

664
00:31:49,514 --> 00:31:52,032
and could really use your help.

665
00:31:54,072 --> 00:31:56,239
I'm flailing at work.

666
00:31:56,264 --> 00:31:58,598
I just found out a
guy I like is engaged,

667
00:31:58,623 --> 00:32:03,727
and I am either going totally nuts,

668
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,491
or I suddenly can hear
people's innermost thoughts

669
00:32:07,516 --> 00:32:10,422
as big musical numbers.

670
00:32:12,657 --> 00:32:13,890
Don't ask.

671
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:20,110
I just feel like everyone's against me.

672
00:32:21,258 --> 00:32:23,594
I'm losing my mind.

673
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:30,196
And the one person who...

674
00:32:31,369 --> 00:32:34,798
seemed to always make me feel
better in times like this...

675
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:40,712
isn't really here anymore...

676
00:32:43,524 --> 00:32:45,899
which is not fair.

677
00:32:48,518 --> 00:32:51,079
'Cause I really need you,

678
00:32:51,104 --> 00:32:52,868
so could you just...

679
00:32:54,134 --> 00:32:56,063
like, snap out of this

680
00:32:56,088 --> 00:33:01,087
or make it all go away or something?

681
00:33:04,396 --> 00:33:10,860
'Cause I don't know who I am
or what I'm doing anymore.

Dad is processing
everything we're saying!

718
00:35:47,901 --> 00:35:49,188
He's still with us.

719
00:35:49,501 --> 00:35:50,818
- How do you know?
- What are you talking about?

720
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,702
You're gonna have to trust
me on this one, okay?

721
00:35:52,727 --> 00:35:55,921
And, also, we're taking him sailing.

722
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:57,860
Oh, Zoey, that's sweet,

723
00:35:57,885 --> 00:35:59,895
but I don't know if
that's such a good idea.

724
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,140
- Yeah, why would we take Dad?
- Stop!

725
00:36:02,165 --> 00:36:03,965
He's always loved going outside,

726
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:06,495
and this is going
to make him happy. Okay?

727
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,121
So I'm gonna call the boat rental place,

728
00:36:08,146 --> 00:36:10,465
and all you have to do
is clear your Sunday,

729
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:12,832
bring a warm jacket, and enjoy the day.

730
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,586
See? That's the way to do it.

731
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:22,410
- Right?
- So, I did what you said.

732
00:36:22,676 --> 00:36:24,262
Last night, I told Jessica everything

733
00:36:24,287 --> 00:36:26,544
that I've been feeling lately,
kinda let it pour out of me.

734
00:36:26,568 --> 00:36:28,222
How'd it go?

735
00:36:28,247 --> 00:36:31,097
Well, it definitely felt
good to say it out loud,

736
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,168
and I guess maybe it
gave her more clarity

737
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:35,294
on how my dad's death has
been affecting me lately,

738
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:36,885
so that part was helpful.

739
00:36:38,164 --> 00:36:41,199
- But?
- I don't think she got it.

740
00:36:41,224 --> 00:36:42,707
You know?

741
00:36:42,732 --> 00:36:45,816
Like, she hasn't had any death,
or real tragedy in her life,

742
00:36:45,841 --> 00:36:49,285
so I'm not sure she
really, really relates,

743
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:51,808
at least not the way you do.

744
00:36:52,486 --> 00:36:54,739
You gave me good advice. It's just...

745
00:36:54,764 --> 00:36:57,255
hard when the two sides
aren't connecting.

746
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,647
And sometimes it feels like we're in

747
00:36:58,671 --> 00:37:01,905
totally separate worlds,
not communicating,

748
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,341
not even on the same bandwidth.

749
00:37:03,366 --> 00:37:05,165
- It's just...
- Wait.

750
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:07,513
Will you excuse me, Simon?

751
00:37:07,885 --> 00:37:09,286
Sure.

752
00:37:10,793 --> 00:37:13,411
It's not the watch or the app.

753
00:37:13,436 --> 00:37:15,880
It's both. That 50-over-20
number isn't a reading.

754
00:37:15,905 --> 00:37:17,497
It's our default value we plugged in

755
00:37:17,522 --> 00:37:19,091
when we were programming it.

756
00:37:19,116 --> 00:37:21,263
The app and the watch aren't
even talking to each other.

757
00:37:21,287 --> 00:37:22,623
They're not communicating.

758
00:37:22,648 --> 00:37:24,858
Tobin, go through the
watch's firmware repository,

759
00:37:24,883 --> 00:37:26,617
and revert any code you
or any of the other guys

760
00:37:26,641 --> 00:37:27,808
touched while looking for the bug.

761
00:37:27,832 --> 00:37:29,537
Uh, why should I listen to you?

762
00:37:29,562 --> 00:37:31,381
If the watch launches
with faulty software,

763
00:37:31,406 --> 00:37:33,358
it's going to reflect
badly on all of us.

764
00:37:33,383 --> 00:37:35,412
Leif, you and the other coders,

765
00:37:35,437 --> 00:37:38,311
start preparing a build to ship
and wait for my final push.

766
00:37:40,245 --> 00:37:43,022
Two more hours,
and I would've gotten it.

767
00:37:43,047 --> 00:37:44,459
Just saying.

768
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,436
Well, Zoey, you solved the bug.

769
00:37:47,461 --> 00:37:48,475
I did.

770
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,866
So I'm gonna ask you one more time.

771
00:37:50,891 --> 00:37:53,686
Why do you think you're manager
of engineering material?

772
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:58,928
Because I am the best coder here.

773
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:01,592
I really want the job,

774
00:38:01,617 --> 00:38:05,100
and I know that I have the power

775
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:08,893
and the ability to be a great leader.

776
00:38:20,495 --> 00:38:22,006
You really think it's okay for him

777
00:38:22,031 --> 00:38:24,014
to go out on the water like this?

778
00:38:24,238 --> 00:38:26,983
We can't keep shielding
him from the world.

779
00:38:27,008 --> 00:38:28,694
We should be doing the opposite.

780
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:30,303
Well, I hear you. I'm just...

781
00:38:30,328 --> 00:38:31,639
- Mom.
- Concerned...

782
00:38:32,717 --> 00:38:34,623
He's happy right now.

783
00:38:35,103 --> 00:38:36,717
Believe me.

784
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:42,662
There's gonna be good days
and bad days, remember?

785
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,116
Let's chalk this up to
one of the good ones.

786
00:38:57,964 --> 00:39:01,459
Being out here, it brings back

787
00:39:01,484 --> 00:39:05,350
a lot of nice old family memories,
doesn't it, darling?

as, like, my rock.

I haven't even told you

going on with me lately.

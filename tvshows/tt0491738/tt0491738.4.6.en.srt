{314}{339}Special girl, huh?
{382}{417}Yeah, kind of.
{423}{467}It's nice to see you|applying yourself.
{470}{515}It looks like you put|a lot of work into that.
{519}{571}Thanks, dad,|but I don't know if I'm gonna send it.
{577}{601}Why?
{605}{629}Why, Shawn?
{633}{672}- There are obstacles.|- Obstacles?
{676}{733}All couples have obstacles.|The key to it is,
{736}{798}you're never gonna know|unless you put yourself out there.
{814}{882}- Gus says it'll never work.|- What does Gus know? Gus is 12.
{886}{922}You remember at that skate party
{925}{983}how he cried|when that girl touched his arm?
{987}{1011}Come on.
{1025}{1074}- What do you think?|- Let's see.
{1077}{1138}The heart is good.|You tell her that she's pretty,
{1142}{1202}but not in an creepy,|aggressive kind of way. I like that.
{1205}{1273}Down here, I think what you wanna do is,|I think you wanna...
{1276}{1332}tell her that you'd like|to call her sometime.
{1346}{1370}Do that.
{1383}{1436}It looks like you forgot|to address it there.
{1439}{1496}You want to write|her name big and pretty,
{1499}{1565}make her think she's important.|You know how sometimes I write
{1569}{1632}and I do the calligraphy|with big loops and swooping letters?
{1635}{1671}Do that, do that up there.
{1711}{1735}Dad,
{1738}{1769}could you do it?
{1785}{1821}Yeah, sure, I guess.
{1869}{1925}All right, what's her name?
{1961}{1990}Mrs. Phillips.
{2737}{2773}What's wrong?
{2792}{2863}I hate having to hide what we have.|You know, we can't really...
{2895}{2951}be together until you tell her.
{2973}{2997}I will.
{3001}{3023}Soon.
{3089}{3113}Mina?
{3146}{3179}You're back on in two minutes.
{3309}{3346}- I'll go.|- No.
{3349}{3393}I don't want to disturb your ritual.
{3408}{3437}It's bad luck.
{4068}{4119}This is my "I told you so" room,
{4122}{4175}where I like to gloat|after a completely wild accusation
{4178}{4241}turns out to be spot on.|That's my "oops" corner,
{4244}{4289}where I apologize to people|for being arrested
{4292}{4358}after a completely wild accusation|turns out to be just that.
{4361}{4403}Over there is where you get gum.
{4406}{4450}- Free, by the way.|- What?
{4496}{4542}- This is...|- I know you.
{4545}{4590}I met you|at our high-school reunion.
{4614}{4641}Yes, you did.
{4649}{4709}- Shawn tells me you're a teacher.|- Yeah, kindergarten.
{4713}{4758}That's great.|I think that's great.
{4761}{4829}I mean, kids... they're so great.|That must be really fun.
{4840}{4899}You know,|I loved my kindergarten teacher.
{4902}{4973}Before I went into law enforcement,|I actually considered teach...
{4977}{5031}This is detective Carlton Lassiter.
{5036}{5090}I do his job and sometimes his hair,
{5094}{5124}though clearly not today.
{5127}{5174}I'm really sorry.|I can't play with you today.
{5177}{5244}I'm about to go solve another case|and do it in record time.
{5295}{5361}It is at this point that I must decide|which part of that very bold statement
{5364}{5441}to riff off of. Now, I can hone|in on "another", which implies
{5444}{5500}- that he's solved more than one.|- That's pretty easy, though.
{5503}{5544}Or I crack down on "record time"
{5547}{5610}and the positive, for him,|record time is, like, 2 and half years.
{5614}{5659}- Good, not great.|- You drive a hard bargain.
{5662}{5716}- You love it.|- I know. Why don't you go home
{5720}{5745}and wait for me
{5749}{5780}not to call you?
{5792}{5857}He's just saying that so|that it'll be more dramatic later on
{5860}{5928}- when he has to ask for my help.|- More dramatic for who?
{5948}{5976}I don't know.
{5989}{6015}That guy, I guess.
{6149}{6173}All right,
{6176}{6224}so what exactly is this information
{6227}{6278}about the accident|behind the theater earlier?
{6290}{6320}This was no accident.
{6329}{6353}Really?
{6367}{6403}Well, that's helpful.
{6406}{6430}And you...
{6436}{6472}You know the victim?
{6476}{6517}Victims, plural.
{6520}{6549}Mina wasn't the only one.
{6569}{6619}Fortunately, she is the only one|who didn't get hurt.
{6634}{6685}Sir, you are exactly|what I needed today.
{6719}{6781}We're gonna have to do this quick|while his girlfriend is still waiting.
{6789}{6817}Whose girlfriend?
{6839}{6902}Never you mind. I'm thinking out loud.|Don't want to interrupt your flow.
{6905}{6934}I like what you're saying,
{6937}{6993}so let's just go straight|to the million-dollar question:
{6996}{7034}who exactly is responsible?
{7080}{7101}I am.
{7104}{7168}I hurt them all.|I'm a danger to everyone around me.
{7221}{7256}All right, Mr. Singh,
{7259}{7298}this is how it's gonna work.
{7301}{7361}See, sometimes there are|these bleeding-heart activist judges
{7364}{7424}who won't take a detective's iron-clad|word for it when he gets
{7428}{7479}a perfectly uncoerced confession.
{7507}{7544}So just so we're clear,
{7547}{7587}I'd like you|to write everything down.
{7591}{7638}When you did it,|where you did it, why you did it.
{7641}{7690}Now, the why is very important.
{7711}{7745}- You're done?|- Yes.
{7755}{7800}You just wrote, like, three words.
{7969}{8006}Would you excuse me?
{8096}{8131}I'll just be a minute.
{8152}{8201}This place was actually built|by the Amish,
{8204}{8270}which explains the complete|and utter lack of zippers.
{8315}{8344}I was too harsh.
{8359}{8395}- When?|- Just now.
{8410}{8439}Perhaps always.
{8460}{8516}The truth is,|the guy in the interrogation room "A"
{8519}{8572}is a solid lead,|and I just don't have the...
{8585}{8646}- You know, to follow through.|- What exactly are you trying to say?
{8664}{8715}I'm saying I need your help.
{8730}{8789}All right,|but only if Abigail can watch.
{8838}{8878}I'll put a chair|in the viewing room.
{8883}{8905}Perfect.
{8913}{8940}Thanks, buddy.
{8959}{8995}This should be interesting.
{9399}{9451}First, I want to tell you that...
{9458}{9479}I love you.
{9570}{9593}Secondly...
{9612}{9651}What can I do for you...?
{9660}{9677}Raj.
{9688}{9749}- Can I call you Roger?|- First name's Rajesh.
{9762}{9797}I'll stick with Roger.
{9823}{9869}I'm going to tell you what I do.
{9874}{9923}I don't want you to freak out|because it's so cool.
{9986}{10015}I'm a psychic,
{10018}{10071}a great and powerful psychic
{10074}{10150}whose powers inspire fear and awe|in those who first experience them.
{10185}{10233}I am a crime-solving machine,
{10236}{10310}{Y:i}and I have closed over 50 cases,
{10317}{10342}{Y:i}many without pants.
{10379}{10429}Finally,|someone who will understand me.
{10465}{10511}You can talk to me.|I am your friend.
{10530}{10589}I hurt people,|lots of people,
{10604}{10667}lots of innocent people.
{10749}{10815}It's funny, 'cause you don't...|really strike me as a violent guy.
{10857}{10892}How could you commit these crimes?
{10899}{10964}I can't help it.|The attacks, they just happen.
{10989}{11013}I see.
{11041}{11064}And...
{11067}{11095}what, you use...
{11098}{11130}some sort of weapon?
{11136}{11180}I am the weapon.
{11252}{11270}Really?
{11274}{11339}And it's immediate.|Even I can't predict it.
{11347}{11392}I can just be alone
{11404}{11451}in a room with somebody.
{11469}{11493}Got it.
{11538}{11571}In that case, Raj,
{11581}{11626}I think all that's left here,
{11637}{11677}{Y:i}question-wise, is...
{11686}{11710}"why?"
{11718}{11786}I mean, why, why,|why do you hurt these people?
{11790}{11823}Why have I hurt these people?
{11836}{11907}You got to see this.|Wait for it. Here it comes.
{11920}{11947}{Y:i}It's because I...
{11983}{12039}It's because I'm...|It's because I'm cursed.
{12111}{12138}{Y:i}Yes, I win.
{12146}{12169}Finally!
{12172}{12216}Finally I put one over on him.
{12230}{12254}This is...
{12269}{12321}This is completely satisfying.
{12446}{12506}You're a psychic.|You must believe me.
{12521}{12556}You must be able to help me.
{12563}{12587}Can you?
{12596}{12629}Yes, I can, Roger.
{12664}{12702}I will break your curse,
{12723}{12790}and I will solve this case,|mostly...
{12816}{12880}Because the detective|who was in here earlier...
{12889}{12912}cannot.
{13043}{13074}This is so good.

{14130}{14203}Timing: Psych Team|www.sous-titres.eu
{14399}{14461}- Where are the bunnies?|- What?
{14465}{14537}You said someone left a dozen bunnies,|and you didn't know how to feed them.
{14563}{14607}I made that up.|I just needed you here, man.
{14618}{14675}- This is about a case, isn't it?|- What do you think?
{14679}{14761}I should have known, when you said|they were falling asleep in your hand.
{14765}{14843}Look, I was humiliated by Lassiter,|Carlton Lassiter.
{14860}{14912}A challenge has been issued,|I need every tool we've got.
{14916}{14974}- Are you calling me a tool?|- I'm calling you my partner.
{14977}{15038}My logic brain,|my magic wish machine.
{15050}{15074}What have we got?
{15156}{15217}My name is Raj.|I have a curse.
{15263}{15305}I don't do curses. You know that.
{15308}{15361}- Gus, come on.|- That mummy almost sucked my eyes out.
{15364}{15402}- It wasn't a mummy.|- Yes, it was.
{15405}{15459}It was a snobby guy|and an effeminate dude in a wheelchair.
{15462}{15496}Apples and oranges.
{15505}{15542}This is a love curse.
{15556}{15600}This poor guy thinks|there's some kind of hex
{15603}{15648}on all the girls|he tries to hook up with.
{15651}{15727}We investigate, find some evidence,|convince him he's not cursed
{15731}{15791}so that he can live a full|and happy life with his lady love.
{15794}{15843}Man, this is a matter of the heart.
{15891}{15942}- He's paying us, right?|- Yeah, cash.
{16064}{16142}The last four women that I've dated|have all had terrible accidents.
{16145}{16192}And with each girl,|it gets worse and worse.
{16195}{16262}The first one had a car accident.|Another's apartment burned down.
{16265}{16311}What do you do|after these things happen?
{16314}{16373}I break up with them.|I have tried to be alone,
{16376}{16411}believe me, I have,
{16414}{16470}but then I met Mina,|and my heart couldn't help itself.
{16479}{16530}I keep thinking|that the next time will be different,
{16533}{16629}but every woman that I fall in love with|is targeted by forces I can't fight.
{16643}{16695}Do you have any enemies|in this world?
{16703}{16728}I'm a nice guy.
{16731}{16777}I don't know why anybody|would want to curse me.
{16780}{16816}You are a nice guy, Roger.
{16819}{16890}And I presume you could teach us both|a thing or two about cricket.
{16893}{16976}But let's not jump to conclusions.|Show me where this accident occurred.
{17021}{17103}It was just inappropriate, Carlton,|with his girlfriend standing there.
{17106}{17179}When has anything he's ever done to me|been appropriate?
{17182}{17278}Having his girlfriend there was just|a gift from god for all my good deeds.
{17306}{17333}Speak of the devil.
{17361}{17453}I want you to know that I am not gonna|gloat about what happened yesterday.
{17457}{17524}Yesterday, why? What happened?|What day is this?
{17528}{17600}The truck ended up striking|the dumpster, fortunately,
{17603}{17655}which pinned the girl|between the grill and the wall,
{17659}{17720}but left her enough room|to escape without serious injury.
{17727}{17799}We talked to the driver, who swears|that he put blocks under the tires
{17802}{17872}to prevent the truck from rolling down|the alley, which is on an incline.
{17882}{17941}- So it is a case?|- I checked out the driver.
{17944}{18017}He's been written up twice for failing|to take basic safety precautions.
{18025}{18067}- So it's not a case?|- We don't know yet.
{18071}{18114}The brakes haven't been checked|in 15 years.
{18117}{18153}It looks like an accident.
{18157}{18233}- Like your hair.|- Really? Down to hair jokes now?
{18328}{18404}That is so sweet.|Look how much he cares for her.
{18437}{18509}He's really taking|this accident pretty hard.
{18592}{18665}My brother Jay is a choreographer,|he's been trying to get this playhouse
{18668}{18733}to put on a bollywood-style show|for years. There he is.
{18737}{18791}Come on, now.|Five, six, seven, eight.
{18848}{18900}Mina said she was coming in|to rehearsals today.
{18903}{18974}I'm just gonna go check on her,|make sure she's okay after the accident.
{19035}{19098}- You don't think Lassiter may be right?|- Gus, please.
{19101}{19155}Don't be Harry Potter|and the prisoner of marzipan.
{19158}{19196}- Azkaban.|- I've read it both ways.
{19199}{19261}- No, you haven't.|- Of course I don't think he's right,
{19264}{19344}but it's not looking too good|for Raj's whole curse idea either.
{19390}{19430}{Y:i}How many of you have seen|All That Jazz?
{19477}{19507}{Y:i}No? White nights?
{19514}{19548}Gregory Hines, Baryshnikov?
{19586}{19648}That explains everything.|We're gonna redo the whole routine.
{19651}{19701}Go wait in my dressing room.|Go, go, go.
{19815}{19834}Lakshmi,
{19838}{19873}she's Mina's understudy.
{19876}{19898}Excellent.
{19902}{19931}Yes, she is.
{19945}{20038}So it's safe to assume|that you don't believe in this curse?
{20042}{20118}Everything that goes wrong in his life,|he blames on the curse.
{20121}{20159}I mean, it's a crutch.
{20168}{20223}Don't get me wrong,|I love him like a brother.
{20232}{20261}He is your brother.
{20274}{20305}Yeah, by blood,
{20317}{20372}but he doesn't live in the same world|as the rest of us.
{20375}{20433}He lives in a world of magic|and goblins,
{20441}{20520}and what he needs to do|is step into reality, okay?
{20532}{20556}Up!
{20577}{20613}Talk some sense into him.
{20620}{20685}I'm getting married in a month, I would|love to have a reasonable person
{20688}{20721}as my best man.
{20724}{20756}He believes in you, psychic,
{20770}{20814}for better or for worse.
{20859}{20888}That butterfly was right.
{20917}{20980}Raj is a guy that just needs|to get out of his own head.
{20983}{21026}Everything bad that happens to him,
{21029}{21085}he interprets as some sort|of divine intervention.
{21088}{21122}It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
{21125}{21166}How do we break him out|of the pattern?
{21169}{21209}Apparently he believes in me,
{21212}{21294}so I will lift his curse,|and you will be my special helper.
{21361}{21403}Cursed girlfriend-ruiner,
{21412}{21436}be gone.
{21448}{21482}This seems dangerous.
{21502}{21545}You're not letting the curse|leave your body.
{21548}{21596}- He's right. You could electrocute him.|- Really?
{21599}{21644}- His hand is in water.|- You tell me that now.
{21647}{21696}You saw what I was doing us|at that bowl.
{21760}{21790}Repeat after me.
{21811}{21840}"I am not cursed.
{21843}{21922}- "It's all in my head."|- But it's not all in my head.
{21926}{21984}You have to say it in order|to believe it. Let me do the rest.
{21995}{22045}- Who is the professional here?|- You?
{22062}{22093}Close your eyes.
{22138}{22169}I am not cursed.
{22179}{22213}It's all in my head.
{22252}{22293}- I'm feeling it.|- Really?
{22314}{22345}Get me the hedge clippers.
{22350}{22416}I guess I am feeling something.|It's tingling.
{22431}{22473}That's the electrical breaker|shorting out.
{22476}{22516}- What?|- It's shorting out.
{22519}{22555}His hand's in water.
{22571}{22639}Are you here? Give me a hand,|I got some groceries here.
{22643}{22696}- Hallelujah, the curse is broken.|- What?
{22699}{22728}All gone. Get your coat.
{22731}{22761}- Broken?|- All broken.
{22765}{22805}Let's get out|efore it finds you again.
{22808}{22853}All gone. You're curse-free.
{23014}{23061}What the hell?|Smoke in my living room?
{23065}{23120}Dad, it's not smoke.|It's just a little dry ice, okay?
{23123}{23189}We're helping a client by freeing him|of the feelings that he might be cursed.
{23197}{23258}The guy that's got the girlfriends|that keep dropping like flies?
{23262}{23298}One girl that we know of for sure.
{23301}{23381}She almost got crushed by a runaway|truck, but she's fine, relatively.
{23388}{23430}- Did you talk to her?|- I didn't need to.
{23433}{23474}She's not gonna crush herself.
{23494}{23545}Smart-ass.|All right, just clean up this crap.
{23548}{23572}Ten-four.
{23588}{23612}That's me,
{23627}{23660}cleaning machine.
{24091}{24132}You seem different.
{24341}{24363}What?
{24366}{24426}Aren't you gonna introduce me|to your...
{24429}{24453}whoever they are?
{24456}{24503}That's Shawn and Greg.
{24513}{24559}And they helped me out
{24563}{24619}with a problem earlier,|and I owe them.
{24639}{24670}Can you hook my friends up
{24681}{24742}with two tickets|for tonight's performance?
{25265}{25310}Standing room,|back of the theater...
{25313}{25360}- Some reward.|- Come on, Greg.
{25374}{25428}Let's just congratulate each other|on a job well done
{25431}{25497}and enjoy this explosion of culture.
{25595}{25652}- What are you doing here?|- What are you doing here?
{25662}{25721}Just celebrating another successful|conclusion to a case.
{25724}{25754}- In record time.|- What?
{25757}{25781}Really?
{25820}{25887}Then you know that the brake lines|on the truck were severed?
{25890}{25932}Look, Lassie,|that truck was very old.
{25959}{25992}Parts can snap at any time.
{25996}{26035}You also know, the safety blocks
{26039}{26088}that should have been|under the tires were found
{26092}{26117}in the dumpster.
{26144}{26193}Maybe we should have done|some actual investigating.
{26196}{26240}- You think?|- What are you two talking about?
{26244}{26263}Nothing.
{26300}{26342}I just might need to go up there.
{26354}{26403}No, Shawn, you do not go up|under any circumstances.
{26406}{26461}- I think we made a huge mistake.|- I don't care.
{26517}{26555}- Shawn, stop it!|- Let go!
{26592}{26649}Don't go boneless on me...|My back!
{27218}{27242}I got you.
{27452}{27488}I told you it was a curse.
{27665}{27728}Did you notice anything suspicious|around the stage today?
{27747}{27799}And you can't think of anyone|that's been threatening you?
{27802}{27826}No one.
{27831}{27888}Don't you worry, miss.|I'm gonna find the person who did this.
{27891}{27929}I'm done. You can take her.
{27949}{28011}Raj, will you meet me|at the hospital?
{28015}{28046}No, I can't.
{28081}{28142}- I have to go.|- Go where? I need you.
{28185}{28213}This is all my fault.
{28234}{28265}I am so sorry...
{28302}{28327}For everything.
{28365}{28395}Raj, come back!
{28486}{28521}They're taking Mina for x-rays.
{28524}{28572}Some uniforms stay with her,|then take her home.
{28576}{28641}We should send a unit|to secure her residence as well.
{28677}{28724}This ladder is really built for one.
{28750}{28798}Jules, lots of things say|they're built for one,
{28801}{28847}but can easily fit two people.
{28850}{28934}Tanning beds, iron lung...|That's just to name two.
{28940}{29021}Why are you still here? II thought|you solved this case hours ago.
{29133}{29221}- Lassiter's really got your goat, huh?|- Yeah, he does, and I want it back.
{29228}{29272}God knows what he's doing|to that poor thing.
{29277}{29364}You don't really believe|in love curses, do you?
{29369}{29405}Jules, I'm a psychic.
{29413}{29464}I have to remain open|to any number of...
{29489}{29519}Why, do you?
{29524}{29607}Well, I think that everybody|who's looking for a soul mate
{29610}{29667}may, at one time, feel|that there are outside forces
{29670}{29714}conspiring against them, but...
{29790}{29826}Shawn, what are you doing?
{29872}{29902}It wasn't a curse...
{29937}{29963}Not this time.
{29987}{30009}Plastic.
{30018}{30063}That wasn't gonna|hold Mina for long.
{30067}{30138}Snapped in two|and painted to look like metal.
{30145}{30220}This means we're looking|for a real flesh and blood human being
{30223}{30271}or a genetically enhanced monkey.
{30274}{30319}Either way, someone wanted|to hurt this girl.
{30323}{30378}I'll have forensics see|what they can get off of these.
{30384}{30421}- This doesn't make sense.|- Why?
{30425}{30496}Because there were, like,|15 backup dancers up here, right?
{30499}{30565}I mean, how would the perpetrator|know that this trapdoor would give way
{30568}{30630}at the precise moment|that Mina danced across it?
{30737}{30791}What are we doing here?|I thought we were going to a movie.
{30794}{30819}Yes, movie, later.
{30822}{30895}But first, Gus and I need to knock|off some quick case business.
{31020}{31038}You!
{31094}{31143}He must've mistaken us|for someone else.
{31240}{31269}Go away, Shawn!
{31305}{31371}I wonder how many Shawns he knows.|I should double-check.
{31452}{31493}You are a fraud!
{31501}{31572}Dude, if you don't let us in,|we're gonna break through your window.
{31574}{31605}We need to talk to you.
{31608}{31666}We got to figure out|who could've wanted to hurt Mina.
{31669}{31691}Fine.
{31697}{31721}It's okay.
{31728}{31746}Fine.
{31789}{31833}Curse breaker?|You ridicule me?
{31837}{31897}My hand in a bowl of water?|You could've gotten Mina killed.
{31901}{31984}The reason the ceremony didn't work,|Raj, is because you are not cursed.
{31996}{32072}- It was sabotage, and I know this.|- And how can you be so sure?
{32080}{32168}Because I happen to travel in these|sort of metaphysical arenas, dude.
{32178}{32251}As sure as I am that Gus will|accidentally cause his own death...
{32258}{32295}I know that you are not cursed.
{32298}{32360}Now, we need to talk to you and Mina.|Is she here or what?
{32385}{32412}Who's out there?
{32435}{32456}Come on.
{32534}{32565}Wonderful.
{32568}{32608}More mouths to feed.
{32615}{32659}Thank you for the advance notice.
{32665}{32702}No, we didn't come to eat.
{32779}{32854}You know, guys, my grandmother tends|to make her food a little spicy.
{32857}{32937}- You might want to take it easy.|- Please. I'm one-quarter Jamaican.
{32946}{32995}- I'm also one-quarter Jamaican.|- You are not!
{32998}{33036}Stop telling people that!
{33214}{33252}So how do you know my grandson Jay?
{33286}{33324}We're actually friends of Raj.
{33328}{33381}You're not here for Jay|and Sita's engagement dinner?
{33418}{33463}We're helping Raj with a problem.
{33466}{33526}I'm sorry, was this chicken|seasoned with molten lava?
{33579}{33621}Sorry about that... Wedding stuff.
{33646}{33668}Hi, I'm Sita.
{33680}{33697}Hi.
{33713}{33760}Did you get the mango leaves?
{33773}{33802}They're not in season.
{33816}{33872}How can we have a wedding|without mango leaves?
{33875}{33904}Very inauspicious.
{33933}{33992}We could push the wedding date,|if it means that much to you.
{34011}{34077}Again? How many times|are we gonna do this?
{34102}{34130}Until it's right.
{34136}{34186}But I already booked|Kajagoogoo for the party.
{34190}{34237}What do you mean, like a cover band?
{34250}{34274}Come on, kid.
{34296}{34352}Don't worry. It's gonna be great.|It'll be beautiful.
{34356}{34418}This wedding business|is more trouble than it's worth.
{34426}{34470}Better than being alone forever.
{34476}{34500}Really?
{34503}{34530}You're just fine?
{34533}{34587}I taught English to children|in Mumbai for a month.
{34590}{34624}This is very authentic.
{34629}{34678}What's the matter, Shawn,|you don't like it?
{34681}{34754}- I think I like it too much.|- It's so authentic.
{34769}{34813}I can't see anything|out of my left eye.
{34816}{34852}I see dead people.
{34934}{34994}- My god, even the water's spicy.|- Who does that?
{35293}{35320}What are you watching?
{35323}{35378}Footage from the night|that Mina was almost killed.
{35381}{35430}On the right screen is|a performance from a week ago.
{35437}{35522}Why you watching this? We were there.|Went over the stage with a comb.
{35526}{35585}Just something that Shawn said|at the crime scene.
{35621}{35639}Wait.
{35700}{35736}Do you see what I see?
{35848}{35893}Looks like I better get a warrant.
{35997}{36048}All right.|I'm sorry, no offense,
{36051}{36123}but it's stupid|that you people eat food this hot.
{36183}{36224}I said "no offense," right?
{36361}{36390}You should marry her.
{36403}{36420}Dadi.
{36423}{36490}She's not on tonight's menu, sorry.
{36503}{36576}She's so much better|than your other lady friends.
{36579}{36629}There were some real gems|amongst those.
{36642}{36688}Dadi, those were|all very nice people.
{36692}{36755}And you found all of the things|that you said were stolen.
{36826}{36857}More uninvited guests.
{36860}{36888}Thank you all very much.
{36891}{36941}I'll just go to my garden|and harvest some food.
{36947}{37001}Okay, I will get that.
{37172}{37197}Spencer, excellent.
{37200}{37261}I'm so glad that you're here|to see me close your case.
{37265}{37316}Would you like a little insight|into our process?
{37319}{37395}You see, first we start by asking|a few simple questions.
{37405}{37449}Jay, would you mind telling me
{37462}{37499}who has changed the choreography
{37502}{37557}so that only Mina danced|over the trapdoor?
{37560}{37617}Of course, I changed the choreography,|but I had no idea...
{37621}{37682}And who originally|wanted Mina's understudy for the role?
{37686}{37753}Well, I originally recommended Lakshmi,|but then I grew to appreciate Mina,
{37756}{37798}especially after|she and Raj started...
{37802}{37829}You have to stop him.
{37845}{37887}Sorry, I don't think|it'll be possible.
{37894}{37956}You see, my partner's already|searching his apartment as we speak,
{37959}{38013}and guess what she already found?
{38024}{38067}Turns out Jay's the one that rented
{38070}{38122}and had access to the truck|that almost killed Mina.
{38174}{38228}Jawaharlal Singh, stand up,|put your hands behind your back.
{38231}{38272}You're under arrest|for attempted murder.
{38279}{38312}- Stand up.|- What?
{38355}{38385}Let's go, tough guy.
{38394}{38435}Lassie, you can't do this.
{38438}{38477}You're way, way off base.
{38481}{38512}What are you talking about?
{38515}{38569}You're the one who gave us|the choreography lead.
{38572}{38613}Thank you for that, by the way.
{38703}{38741}Come on, come on!
{38752}{38821}But we're supposed to get|married in a month.
{38830}{38872}You're destroying my family.
{39032}{39072}So you came here to help Raj.
{39082}{39137}But instead you got his brother|arrested for attempted murder.
{39140}{39166}That's correct.
{39170}{39204}Business as usual?
{39214}{39250}It's a process.
{39368}{39407}I'm sure it's just|a misunderstanding.
{39410}{39453}Don't cry.|We'll sort it out.
{39500}{39556}- Here's the good news.|- You see what you've done?
{39566}{39649}You ridiculed my curse and my beliefs,|and now it's affecting everyone I love.
{39657}{39697}First it was Mina, then my brother,
{39700}{39754}and now Sita,|who's like a sister to me.
{39759}{39797}Look, Raj, I can fix this.
{39801}{39881}The case against Jay is pretty strong.|They have motive, means, opportunity.
{39884}{39951}The only thing they don't have is|a video of him committing the crime.
{39958}{40005}Maybe you can find that|for the cops too, Shawn.
{40008}{40049}Leave us all alone.|You've done enough.
{40077}{40104}Stop it, Raj.
{40114}{40138}Just stop.
{40142}{40209}There is no curse.|Someone is doing this to you.
{40213}{40235}Really?
{40238}{40293}Then how do you explain|what happened to Gita, Raini,
{40297}{40329}Dipti, and Victoria, huh?
{40333}{40381}- He's like a puma.|- We need to get out of here.
{40399}{40441}- How'd he get up so fast?|- I don't know.
{40444}{40513}- I blinked, and he was right there.|- He's probably right.
{40516}{40584}We should talk to Gila,|Ray Jay, and Dipstick.
{40587}{40641}You know those names|were nowhere near close, right?
{40646}{40693}It all started|with the break-in at my condo.
{40736}{40770}And then a car accident.
{40781}{40833}Next thing I knew,|my apartment was on fire.
{40837}{40917}We talked about moving in|together, right before it ended.
{40921}{41005}I met his family on Friday,|and by the next weekend, it was over.
{41034}{41079}He seemed really sad to call it off.
{41113}{41173}Right when things were best,|I thought he was the one.
{41176}{41208}I had that accident.
{41211}{41252}Then he said|we couldn't be together.
{41259}{41314}Are you as jealous|of this guy as I am?
{41317}{41341}More...
{41352}{41418}Except for the parts|where his girlfriends almost die.
{41571}{41621}They're releasing my brother,|no thanks to you.
{41643}{41689}Actually, all thanks to me.
{41692}{41753}I'm the one that lined up his alibi|with the timeline of the crime.
{41757}{41795}I'm the one that found two witnesses
{41799}{41851}that put him someplace else|when the sabotage occurred.
{41854}{41915}And I am the one that got him|arrested in the first place.
{41936}{41976}That last one didn't play.
{41979}{42035}Just scratch the last one, okay?
{42051}{42087}We spoke to your other girlfriends.
{42090}{42142}And we have concluded|that they were all kind of hot.
{42146}{42166}That's true.
{42183}{42231}But more importantly,|there's a pattern here.
{42234}{42276}This person,|whoever's out to get you,
{42279}{42329}only strikes when you get|serious with someone.
{42333}{42393}- I don't understand.|- It means it's someone you know.
{42396}{42458}Or knows you, and they only attack|when you've committed to someone.
{42470}{42525}I've devised a plan|to draw out the attacker.
{42528}{42590}We just need Mina...|I need to stop you right there.
{42616}{42637}Mina's gone.
{42643}{42667}What?
{42672}{42741}- You didn't kill her, did you?|- Gus, please, some decorum.
{42763}{42827}- You didn't, right?|- No! I put her on a plane.
{42838}{42867}I broke it off with her.
{42879}{42925}Maybe I was just meant to be alone.
{42955}{43024}You would rather lose her than see|the possibility of harm come to her.
{43027}{43064}You love her that much?
{43067}{43123}- I don't know any other way to love.|- Really?
{43129}{43166}{Y:i}Have you seen 9 1/2 weeks?
{43169}{43222}Or any of Zalman King's other stuff?
{43249}{43320}- What's the plan?|- It's not important now.
{43326}{43399}We were going to dangle Mina out|to lure the killer to attack.
{43403}{43482}You were gonna make the woman I love,|the woman I would give my life for...
{43485}{43568}- You were gonna make her bait?|- Bait? That's a strong...
{43578}{43610}fishing term.
{43642}{43680}We were gonna make her an incentive,
{43689}{43775}since the attacker's only pattern|is to keep you from finding love.
{43810}{43840}I have an idea.
{44001}{44019}Man,
{44056}{44082}I don't like this.
{44086}{44166}- You don't like Julia dating somebody.|- Fake dating.
{44169}{44202}But that's not it.
{44217}{44279}It's this whole|"using her as bait" thing.
{44289}{44338}You had no problem|dangling his girlfriend as bait.
{44342}{44398}Now you're changing the rules,|aren't you?
{44401}{44428}Look at Raj.
{44444}{44499}He's getting|awfully "handsy" over there,
{44516}{44576}taking advantage|of the situation like that.
{44579}{44655}{Y:i}No, he's definitely bugged|by O'Hara dating this guy.
{44745}{44795}Don't leave the talk button on.
{44888}{44920}That was so good.
{44931}{44998}I've never had broccoli|in a milkshake before.
{45006}{45062}But just think|how good it is for you.
{45065}{45098}Well, well, well.
{45116}{45142}It's 11:20.
{45145}{45201}Look who finally decided|to come home.
{45205}{45237}I'm sorry, Shawn.
{45249}{45320}- Are you upset about something?|- As a matter of fact, I am...
{45349}{45373}What did I do?
{45376}{45448}I didn't like this idea to begin with.|You've been on four dates now.
{45451}{45495}It's been|a complete and total failure.
{45499}{45546}No, Shawn,|we've been on three dates.
{45550}{45618}No, there was the carnival,|where Raj won you a big, fat octopus.
{45629}{45706}There was a long walk on the pier,|where he kept brushing your hair gently.
{45717}{45782}Then there was dinner tonight,|where there was a lot of hand-holding.
{45785}{45832}Who could forget coffee|at the police department,
{45835}{45913}where you blushed and squealed|and giggled like a schoolgirl?
{45916}{45963}He was there to sign some papers.
{45966}{46031}- You were watching us?|- It's called surveillance.
{46034}{46068}I "surveillate" things.
{46071}{46111}I'm a purveyor of "surveillerism."
{46126}{46182}Let's not get caught up in wordplay.|The point is,
{46185}{46272}{Y:i}we've been at this charade for 3 weeks,|and it's yielded a grand total of nada.
{46276}{46343}- You're right.|- Of course I am. You see that?
{46353}{46434}It's clear that the killer doesn't think|detective O'Hara is my girlfriend,
{46438}{46490}or maybe they know|I'm still in love with Mina.
{46493}{46560}We can keep at this for six months,|we're still not gonna get anywhere.
{46569}{46653}Unless we did something|to remove all doubt, something big.
{46656}{46740}You said it yourself,|it happens when Raj gets serious.
{46744}{46762}Right.
{46771}{46857}Your entire family's going|to the Holi Festival this weekend?
{46883}{46919}I have another idea.
{46983}{47022}You want to get married?
{47344}{47390}This is so considerate of you.
{47393}{47460}I always wanted to go to the Festival|when I was in India.
{47463}{47492}Yes, I sensed that.
{47495}{47550}I'm aware|of your immense love for...
{47553}{47603}traditional festivals of colors.
{47609}{47677}There also might be a killer here,|and I may need you to block an exit.
{47681}{47700}What?
{47720}{47751}Fresh laddu.
{47844}{47872}There's Mrs. Singh.
{47876}{47958}She hates me, and people don't hate me.|I get cards from people I arrest.
{47970}{48004}She doesn't hate you, okay?
{48008}{48103}Apparently I don't fit the picture|of what her perfect Raj deserves.
{48110}{48191}I am smart, and I am fun,|and I am almost always in a good mood.
{48196}{48247}You're not actually marrying Raj,|remember?
{48265}{48334}- Let's just get this show on the road.|- Please.
{48395}{48427}Hello, everybody.
{48437}{48516}I see that a lot of my family|are here today, and...
{48520}{48565}I wanted to share|some great news with you.
{48574}{48644}As many of you know,|I've had some trying times lately.
{48652}{48709}I lost a love|that I thought was true
{48721}{48789}and... had some trouble|within my family.
{48802}{48838}But this woman here,
{48854}{48928}this beautiful angel|has been my savior.
{48966}{49037}And I know that a lot of you|will think it's crazy, and...
{49047}{49084}it may be impulsive, but...
{49092}{49149}I've asked my beautiful Juliet|to marry me,
{49216}{49242}and she accepted.
{49361}{49410}All right.|Looks like people bought it.
{49438}{49480}Now we just have to wait.
{49494}{49518}And watch.
{49615}{49661}Is it too early for a snack?
{49669}{49708}We've been here five minutes.
{49753}{49822}All right, I admit it.|I was wrong about the brother.
{49825}{49885}- We should call a truce.|- That's awfully big of you.
{49915}{49973}Detective,|might I have a word with you?
{49977}{50011}What can I do fo...
{50014}{50077}Wait a minute.|You're the guy from the theater, right?
{50081}{50134}I didn't tell you everything|the day you questioned me.
{50160}{50211}On that night|just before the accident,
{50214}{50279}I overheard|Mina and the Raj guy talking...
{50300}{50354}{Y:i}I hate having to hide what we have.
{50366}{50445}{Y:i}You know we can't really be together|until you tell her.
{50465}{50496}{Y:i}I will. Soon.
{50514}{50551}He was seeing someone else.
{50563}{50641}Mina was going to expose the affair,|giving Raj motive for murder.
{50660}{50713}He wasn't distraught|because he almost lost his girlfriend.
{50716}{50766}It was guilt|over trying to kill her.
{50769}{50815}His first confession was real.
{50829}{50869}{Y:i}Who, exactly, is responsible?
{50872}{50890}{Y:i}I am.
{50895}{50959}{Y:i}I hurt them all.|I'm a danger to everyone around me.
{50968}{51022}I solved it. It was Raj.|Truce over.
{51026}{51088}- You can't take back a truce.|- You coming with me or not?
{51106}{51168}Raj wouldn't cheat on his taxes,|much less his girlfriend.
{51172}{51208}I'll take that as a no.
{51270}{51336}Tell him, you can't take back a truce.|Indian giver!
{51516}{51577}I meant to insult|an entirely different group
{51580}{51626}of Indians.|Sorry about that.
{51655}{51712}You can't endanger Juliet|over a gripe with Lassiter.
{51715}{51779}I'm not. You heard the dude|from Temple of Doom.
{51782}{51823}Raj was hiding his relationship,
{51826}{51878}but from who?|That's who we're looking for.
{51904}{51953}And Lassiter's following Raj,|who didn't do it.
{51956}{52010}Then who exactly is watching Jules?
{52139}{52163}There!
{52254}{52291}What happened?|Where's Juliet?
{52316}{52383}I got hit from behind.|Next thing I knew, she was gone.
{52386}{52412}Did you see who?
{52424}{52502}- No, it all happened so fast.|-  Do you want me to call an ambulance?
{52505}{52527}I'm fine.
{52535}{52594}Spread out, everybody.|I want eyes on my partner in 5 minutes.
{52602}{52648}You, take a break.|Have a sweet ball.
{52781}{52805}Excuse me.
{53158}{53182}There!
{53435}{53489}It's gonna be okay, Sita.|Just take it easy.
{53493}{53521}I know what's going on.
{53524}{53564}- You do?|- Of course I do.
{53568}{53603}Shut up! Don't come any closer.
{53617}{53662}I can see... I can see it all.
{53687}{53733}You met Jay.|He proposed. You accepted.
{53749}{53802}Then you starting|hanging out with the family,
{53805}{53828}mostly Raj.
{53848}{53883}That's when you realized
{53886}{53941}you were truly in love with Raj,
{53955}{53984}not your fiance.
{53993}{54021}But you were stuck.
{54025}{54086}You couldn't call off the engagement,|make a play for Raj.
{54090}{54162}He would never do that to his brother.|So what did you do?
{54255}{54297}Really, dude? Really?
{54322}{54362}- Where was I?|- She was stuck.
{54365}{54409}Right. You were stuck,
{54425}{54479}engaged to one man|but in love with his brother.
{54483}{54523}So you decided to take action.
{54527}{54607}First, you did everything you could|to delay your wedding to Jay.
{54634}{54710}{Y:i}We could push the wedding date,|if it means that much to you.
{54719}{54794}Then, you sabotaged|all of Raj's relationships,
{54802}{54852}waiting for a time|when both of you were free,
{54855}{54902}convincing him|that he would be by himself
{54906}{54985}for the rest of time, making it easier|for you to swoop in at the right moment.
{55001}{55025}Poor Mina,
{55028}{55065}she was the easiest one of all.
{55073}{55130}Nobody was gonna question|why you were hanging around.
{55133}{55200}After all, you were engaged|to the choreographer.
{55203}{55245}You swing by, you say, "hi,"
{55253}{55311}and that's what granted you access|to the crew's trucks.
{55323}{55393}Probably even had blueprints|and keys to the theater.
{55418}{55509}You even watched the rehearsal|to see if the dance steps changed.
{55536}{55560}Get back.
{55575}{55609}I'm gonna kill her.
{55613}{55674}She can't have what I want,
{55682}{55715}because he's mine.
{55719}{55779}Me and Raj,|we're meant to be together.
{55804}{55826}Let her go.
{55858}{55921}Let her go, and all of this|will be much easier for you.
{55933}{55954}You were...
{55976}{56022}You were crazy in love.
{56043}{56113}Any fool could see|what would drive you to do this.
{56440}{56466}Word of advice,
{56471}{56535}when you take someone hostage,|you might want to check for weapons.
{56541}{56588}Drop the knife.|Drop it.
{56631}{56670}- Did Abigail see that?|- I'm here.
{56673}{56726}Yes, you are.|The pain surprised me.
{56729}{56785}And I wasn't supposed|to get slapped by a girl.
{56788}{56817}It's a process.
{56834}{56871}It is a process.
{56908}{56954}- What'd I miss?|- Not me getting slapped.
{56965}{57011}- By a girl.|- 'Cause that didn't happen.
{57015}{57093}You're caught... Assaulting a cop|and tons of witnesses.
{57097}{57132}You're not gonna get away.
{57237}{57283}Have fun with shock therapy.
{57414}{57475}I got a wedding invitation|from Raj and Mina.
{57485}{57508}It feels good,
{57511}{57582}bringing people together,|watching them sail off into the sunset,
{57585}{57646}giving a good guy|the old happily-ever-after.
{57649}{57710}I felt for Raj. End of the day,|we had a great deal in common.
{57725}{57756}You gonna go?
{57759}{57797}I barely knew that dude.
{57800}{57856}And this, Abigail,|is where we end our tour,
{57860}{57895}because right here
{57898}{57981}is where I choose not to gloat|when I've gotten the best of Lassie.
{57985}{58010}Right here?
{58039}{58067}It's more all...
{58070}{58109}All-overish, I guess.
{58119}{58152}But I've never done that,
{58156}{58197}though there's|a 1st time for everything.
{58201}{58243}Color me impressed.
{58247}{58297}I'd rather color you|with edible body paints.
{58309}{58330}Duly noted.
{58334}{58376}Besides, it's not that impressive.
{58379}{58441}I solve a case every week|and usually one around christmas.
{58445}{58488}It was so impressive
{58491}{58549}the way you just attacked|that mad woman with a knife.
{58561}{58643}It says so much about your character,|about how you feel.
{58658}{58678}How I feel?
{58683}{58754}You risked your life|for a random coworker.
{58865}{58897}She's not random.
{58976}{59050}What I mean is, it's part of the job.|I would do that for anybody...
{59053}{59094}Colleague, coworker,
{59097}{59167}Corey Haim once.|Wouldn't do it again, to be honest.
{59170}{59241}Never got a thank you, and I'm sure|he stole my medic alert bracelet.
{59244}{59291}- You have one of those?|- It's Gus'.
{59308}{59335}Long story.
{59338}{59396}So am I fingerprinting you or what?|It's fun,
{59400}{59479}but you'll have little black fingers|for, like, a month.
{59528}{59577}Three stores have been hit|in 15 minutes.
{59581}{59644}Units are in pursuit of the suspects.|Let's roll!
{59678}{59702}Go ahead.
{59760}{59818}I got the last one.|We'll let Lassie have this one.
{59968}{60011}Want to do a fake mug shot instead?
{60024}{60066}Are you kidding me right now?
{60095}{60170}We'll need costumes. Where did I put|the key to the evidence locker?
{60185}{60219}The holding cells.

1
00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:12,851
Please don't touch it.

2
00:00:12,851 --> 00:00:13,989
Excuse me.

3
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:22,079
Gus, Gus, Gus!

4
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:23,529
Where's your project, Shawn?

5
00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:25,236
- Did you even do it?
- My project?

6
00:00:25,236 --> 00:00:26,286
Of course I did it.

7
00:00:26,286 --> 00:00:27,452
When?

8
00:00:27,452 --> 00:00:28,497
When?

9
00:00:28,497 --> 00:00:29,604
Last night.

10
00:00:29,604 --> 00:00:30,651
It's right here.

11
00:00:30,651 --> 00:00:32,596
This head
is to exact scale.

12
00:00:32,596 --> 00:00:34,617
It took me three months
to make it.

13
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,673
Yours took five minutes.

14
00:00:36,673 --> 00:00:38,816
No, Gus, you're totally wrong.

15
00:00:38,816 --> 00:00:40,696
It took me a whole hour.

16
00:00:41,506 --> 00:00:43,174

18
00:00:57,603 --> 00:00:59,879
I hate you, Shawn.

19
00:01:14,395 --> 00:01:15,697
Lompoc.

20
00:01:16,496 --> 00:01:18,054
Okay, I did it.

21
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:24,683
That's seven in row.

22
00:01:24,683 --> 00:01:26,736
Eight... the gas station guy
confessed last week!

23
00:01:26,736 --> 00:01:28,523
Oh, I wouldn't
call myself a hero.

24
00:01:28,523 --> 00:01:30,512
I'm just doing my job
just like all of you.

25
00:01:30,512 --> 00:01:31,727
Hey, that's enough
goofing off.

26
00:01:31,727 --> 00:01:33,086
Let's get back
to work, huh?

27
00:01:33,086 --> 00:01:34,247
You too.

28
00:01:34,247 --> 00:01:35,672
Ladies and gentlemen,

29
00:01:35,672 --> 00:01:36,965
Detective Lassiter!

30
00:01:36,965 --> 00:01:38,845
Oh, stop it!

31
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:44,614
- Jules!
- Shawn.

32
00:01:44,968 --> 00:01:47,280
- Is there a problem?
- With what?

33
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,366
With you. With me.
With the Chief.

34
00:01:49,752 --> 00:01:51,498
She hasn't called
in a month.

35
00:01:51,498 --> 00:01:53,940
Is she still mad about me
requisitioning the Segway?

36
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,185
You did that?

37
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,053
No.

38
00:01:57,783 --> 00:01:59,230
Well, I don't really

39
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:02,434
have time right now,
but the short answer is

40
00:02:02,434 --> 00:02:04,781
we just haven't really needed
any outside help.

41
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:06,455
Well, what's the long answer?

42
00:02:06,455 --> 00:02:08,144
I mean,
throw a "but" in there

43
00:02:08,144 --> 00:02:09,609
and add something
about a dream

44
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:11,636
where you and I got thrown out
of a mattress showroom.

45
00:02:11,636 --> 00:02:13,962
Detective Lassiter
is literally on fire.

46
00:02:13,962 --> 00:02:15,244
What kind of fire
are we talking about?

47
00:02:15,244 --> 00:02:17,084
Michael Jackson
in the Pepsi commercial fire

48
00:02:17,084 --> 00:02:19,039
or misusing the word
"literally" fire?

49
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,598
He's solved eight cases
in a row fire.

50
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:24,929
Nine... I just rembered
the DeShano case.

51
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:26,675
Hey, Shawn.
What's new?

52
00:02:26,675 --> 00:02:28,233
You still doing
the psychic thing?

53
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:32,013
Is this some sort of
weird dream?

54
00:02:32,013 --> 00:02:34,339
On the last two cases,
the first suspect

55
00:02:34,339 --> 00:02:35,919
Lassiter questioned confessed.

56
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,156
It's really magnificent.

57
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:40,051
We are talking about
Carlton Lassiter, right?

58
00:02:40,051 --> 00:02:41,128
Yea high?

59
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:43,471
Bats ninth for the department
softball team?

60
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:44,934
Tenth.
We play with a rover.

61
00:02:44,934 --> 00:02:47,642
Spencer, long time, no see.

62
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,994
Or is that no need?

63
00:02:50,976 --> 00:02:52,391
I can't believe this.

64
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:54,577
Oh, believe it.
It's real.

65
00:02:54,577 --> 00:02:56,257
They've done a preliminary
on the body down

66
00:02:56,257 --> 00:02:57,484
at the marina, Detective.

67
00:02:57,484 --> 00:02:58,909
They're ready for you
at the scene.

68
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:01,102
Well, I would love
to stay and chat,

69
00:03:01,102 --> 00:03:03,191
but duty does call.

70
00:03:04,368 --> 00:03:05,837
Oh, Spencer, you look so sad.

71
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:09,850
Come on, we'll show you
how real cops do it.

72
00:03:11,575 --> 00:03:12,857
No comeback?

73
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:16,448
Shawn, that's
slightly embarrassing.

74
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:20,949
Where'd you get that... suit?
The toilet store?

75
00:03:32,292 --> 00:03:34,193
Good luck with this one,
Detective.

76
00:03:34,193 --> 00:03:35,982
There's no identification.

77
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:41,371
Nobody's been reported missing
fitting this description.

78
00:03:41,627 --> 00:03:43,715
Oh, Mr. Spencer.

79
00:03:43,715 --> 00:03:45,603
I'm surprised
you didn't take the Segway.

80
00:03:45,603 --> 00:03:47,078
She did know about that.

81
00:03:47,078 --> 00:03:48,228
O'Hara just told me.

82
00:03:48,664 --> 00:03:49,846
Traitor.

83
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:52,120
I'll deal with you later.

84
00:03:56,146 --> 00:03:58,135
So what's the new
case we've got?

85
00:03:58,135 --> 00:04:00,179
A slight error
in grammar there, buddy.

86
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:01,522
Which part?
"Got. "

87
00:04:01,522 --> 00:04:03,831
I came all the way down
from the office, Shawn.

88
00:04:03,831 --> 00:04:05,924
Gus, don't be
a giant snapping turtle.

89
00:04:05,924 --> 00:04:08,615
We'll have a case
in five minutes.

90
00:04:16,045 --> 00:04:18,564
Nobody can explain
these puncture wounds.

91
00:04:18,564 --> 00:04:20,553
We can't rule out
an animal attack.

92
00:04:22,464 --> 00:04:24,807
No... no, there's nothing
in these waters

93
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:26,442
with a bite radius that large.

94
00:04:26,442 --> 00:04:30,216
No, this is maybe
a... boating accident.

95
00:04:30,216 --> 00:04:32,837
The wounds caused by
some machinery.

96
00:04:32,837 --> 00:04:34,957
I can't really be sure
at this juncture.

97
00:04:34,957 --> 00:04:37,288
Completely stumped.

98
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:39,340
You getting something,

99
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,467
Mr. Spencer?

100
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:42,928
Yes.

101
00:04:45,422 --> 00:04:46,928
Yes, I am.

102
00:04:50,218 --> 00:04:52,897
No, no, no! No, hold on.
Okay, I've got it.

103
00:04:52,897 --> 00:04:53,849
The wound on the head

104
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:55,750
was caused by the edge
of a boat

105
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,901
when he fell in the water
unconscious.

106
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:00,624
And the wounds on the back,

107
00:05:00,624 --> 00:05:03,774
they were caused by a large
industrial crab trap.

108
00:05:06,023 --> 00:05:07,581
Or a whale.

109
00:05:07,581 --> 00:05:09,094
It definitely
could've been a whale.

110
00:05:09,094 --> 00:05:11,222
Lost from his pod.

111
00:05:11,222 --> 00:05:13,829
Separated, migrating
north or south.

112
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:16,865
And sees our man dead,
already floating up

113
00:05:16,865 --> 00:05:17,760
above the surface.

114
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,147
Thinks it's a seal
and then... whale.

115
00:05:21,753 --> 00:05:23,256
A whale?

116
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,366
What's your guy got?

117
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,134
Watch and learn, Jules.

118
00:05:26,134 --> 00:05:27,184
Watch and learn.

119
00:05:27,184 --> 00:05:28,343
Or...
Detective,

120
00:05:28,343 --> 00:05:29,150
if you don't mind,

121
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,886
I'd like to see what
Mr. Spencer has to offer.

122
00:05:33,864 --> 00:05:34,759
All right, look,

123
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,681
this is gonna be
a little rough, okay?

124
00:05:36,681 --> 00:05:38,236
I didn't have time
for shading.

125
00:05:38,236 --> 00:05:39,938
There's no forced perspective.

126
00:05:39,938 --> 00:05:41,253
If I had really
had my druthers,

127
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:42,154
I would've done it
in charcoal.

128
00:05:42,154 --> 00:05:43,452
You know what
I'm talking about.

129
00:05:43,678 --> 00:05:45,253
Look, what I'm trying
to say is,

130
00:05:45,253 --> 00:05:46,258
I'm not the artist
I'd like to be...

131
00:05:46,258 --> 00:05:47,358
Okay, Mr. Spencer, enough.

132
00:05:47,358 --> 00:05:49,561
Can you or can you not
tell us who's responsible

133
00:05:49,561 --> 00:05:50,306
for this man's death?

134
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:52,974
If I can present you
with a semi-accurate sketch

135
00:05:52,974 --> 00:05:55,151
of the culprit, is that enough
to get us on this case?

136
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:56,151
Yes.

137
00:05:57,269 --> 00:05:58,655
All right.

138
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,893
The puncture wounds.

139
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:00,943
They're the key.

140
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,661
Giving me the impression
that this crime could only

141
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:07,794
have been committed...
by this guy.

142
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:11,991
This guy here.

143
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:20,564
Excuse me.

144
00:06:21,324 --> 00:06:22,324
What?

145
00:06:23,324 --> 00:06:24,584
Chief?

146
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,881
Where are you off to?

147
00:06:27,941 --> 00:06:29,642
So what, that's a no?

148
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:31,294
Gus!

149
00:06:34,815 --> 00:06:37,078
This is not a boating accident.

150
00:06:41,158 --> 00:06:42,937
# I know you know #

151
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:44,705
# That I'm not telling
the truth #

152
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:46,400
# I know you know #

153
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,091
# They just don't have
any proof #

154
00:06:48,091 --> 00:06:49,428
# Where's the deception? #

155
00:06:49,428 --> 00:06:50,820
# Learn how to bend #

156
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,810
# Your worst inhibitions #

157
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,019
# Tend to psych you out
in the end #

158
00:07:04,543 --> 00:07:05,571
You're mad.

159
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:07,449
No, I'm not mad. I'm happy.

160
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:10,079
I'm thrilled. I love looking
like an idiot.

161
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,537
Well, that explains
your shoes.

162
00:07:11,537 --> 00:07:13,334
You almost closed down
our agency

163
00:07:13,334 --> 00:07:14,675
with that little act
of yours, Shawn.

164
00:07:14,675 --> 00:07:15,706
Me?

165
00:07:15,706 --> 00:07:17,408
You're the one spending
all your extra time

166
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:18,900
at your little
"side project. "

167
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,895
You mean my real job?

168
00:07:21,114 --> 00:07:22,871
Soon to be my only job?

169
00:07:22,871 --> 00:07:24,738
Gus, you're panicking.
Don't panic.

170
00:07:24,738 --> 00:07:27,595
Those bite marks are consistent
with a tyrannosaurus bite.

171
00:07:27,595 --> 00:07:29,422
You know that.
Yes, I know that.

172
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,556
The hard way.

173
00:07:31,556 --> 00:07:34,379
I was canned from the Wyoming
Natural History Museum

174
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:35,440
for that little shot.

175
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,047
The bruises from the teeth
didn't go away for a year,

176
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:39,157
but totally worth it.

177
00:07:39,157 --> 00:07:41,064
It was my best
screensaver ever.

178
00:07:41,064 --> 00:07:44,136
Gus, please, connecting
a dinosaur to this case

179
00:07:44,136 --> 00:07:45,467
is the least of our worries.

180
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:47,290
Look, I can I stash
a toy dinosaur

181
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,196
in the window of the killer.

182
00:07:48,196 --> 00:07:50,760
I can link him to a box
of Dino Bites or Fruity Pebbles.

183
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,908
I can play Six Degrees of Dinosaur
with you right now.

184
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:00,663
You've never been in a movie
with Kevin Bacon

185
00:08:00,663 --> 00:08:01,884
or a Dilaposaurus, have you?

186
00:08:01,884 --> 00:08:05,243
How about you play
Six Degrees of Kiss My Ass?

187
00:08:05,243 --> 00:08:07,971
First of all, that sounds like
a totally disturbing game.

188
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:10,303
What's weird is that my guess
on the jaw radius

189
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:12,019
was actually spot on.

190
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:15,091
It almost seems to make sense.

191
00:08:15,091 --> 00:08:17,996
So now you're getting on board
with your own joke theory?

192
00:08:17,996 --> 00:08:19,907
How are you gonna match
your bite radius

193
00:08:19,907 --> 00:08:20,990
to the victim, Shawn?

194
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,641
Drag the body
to the Wyoming museum?

195
00:08:26,703 --> 00:08:27,951
I can do you one better.

196
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:29,255
What?

197
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:31,410
I need to borrow
my dad's truck.

198
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,174
You coming or what?

199
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:36,332
That's clearly a no.

200
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:38,857
The one thing we can be sure of is

201
00:08:38,857 --> 00:08:41,144
the cause of death
was not drowning.

202
00:08:41,144 --> 00:08:44,220
Blunt force trauma
to the head was severe enough

203
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,546
to knock him unconscious.

204
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:48,165
More than likely he fell
from some sort of

205
00:08:48,165 --> 00:08:50,993
a platform after
knocking himself on the head.

206
00:08:50,993 --> 00:08:52,806
And this is how he ended up
in the water?

207
00:08:52,806 --> 00:08:54,629
No, he landed
on something hard.

208
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:56,288
Dislocated a rib.

209
00:08:56,288 --> 00:08:58,955
He has bruises consistent
with a six, seven,

210
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,104
or eight-foot fall.

211
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:02,281
My guess is that he landed
on something else

212
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:06,198
and ultimately expired
before tumbling into the water.

213
00:09:06,198 --> 00:09:07,756
You know, this might be a leap,

214
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,666
but I would check
the offshore oil rigs.

215
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,788
See if any of them
are missing workers.

216
00:09:11,788 --> 00:09:13,563
I'll make some calls.

217
00:09:13,563 --> 00:09:15,123
Interesting, Detective.

218
00:09:15,123 --> 00:09:16,222
Thanks, Chief.

219
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,459
This theory feels good.
Just makes sense.

220
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:20,895
The work boots, the odd
configuration of the wounds.

221
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,945
You know us, Ted.
It's worth a shot, right?

222
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:24,525
- We don't go out on limbs too often...
- Thanks, guys.

223
00:09:24,525 --> 00:09:26,309
I just need
to measure something.

224
00:09:28,582 --> 00:09:29,830
Oh, good!

225
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,457
You're all here.
Get ready to be shocked.

226
00:09:32,457 --> 00:09:34,625
Can we get the sheet
off the dead guy, please?

227
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,219
Confirming the bite radius...

228
00:09:36,219 --> 00:09:38,368
No! Mr. Spencer...

229
00:09:38,368 --> 00:09:40,487
Whoa, hey, hey, be careful.
This isn't mine.

230
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:43,189
Mr. Spencer, your antics
have always been a little...

231
00:09:43,189 --> 00:09:44,986
let's say unorthodox.

232
00:09:44,986 --> 00:09:46,688
But let me be as frank
as I can be

233
00:09:46,688 --> 00:09:49,307
with my assessment
of your most recent behavior.

234
00:09:49,307 --> 00:09:50,577
Seek help.

235
00:09:50,577 --> 00:09:54,119
Chief, sometimes
you have to jump off a cliff.

236
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:55,445
You have to close your eyes.

237
00:09:55,445 --> 00:09:57,970
You have to unhook
your clip "chasses"...

238
00:09:58,899 --> 00:09:59,959
Chassis?

239
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:04,334
Climbing thing...

240
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:06,434
and you have to leap.

241
00:10:06,434 --> 00:10:08,036
Now I ask you, Chief...

242
00:10:08,036 --> 00:10:09,860
will you leap with me?

243
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,550
Are you thinking about
jumping off a cliff?

244
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,270
Maybe.

245
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,521
Dad!

246
00:10:28,521 --> 00:10:31,370
I've brought the keys back.
Hello!

247
00:10:35,196 --> 00:10:37,317
Okay, this is creepy.
Why is Gus here?

248
00:10:37,317 --> 00:10:38,959
Why do you think, Shawn?

249
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,616
He's a hostage.

250
00:10:40,616 --> 00:10:42,998
Perhaps I can shed
some light on that.

251
00:10:43,301 --> 00:10:44,832
Two hostages.

252
00:10:44,832 --> 00:10:47,416
Doug Devette is an old colleague
of mine from the force.

253
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,515
The Chief asked me
to have him drop by.

254
00:10:50,331 --> 00:10:51,483
Why?

255
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,595
Doug is the department
psychologist, Shawn.

256
00:10:55,048 --> 00:10:56,982
What is this, some sort
of intervention?

257
00:10:56,982 --> 00:10:58,109
Yeah, sort of.

258
00:10:58,109 --> 00:11:01,126
We don't like to use the term
"intervention," Shawn.

259
00:11:01,576 --> 00:11:02,593
Gus?

260
00:11:02,593 --> 00:11:03,333
Don't look at me.

261
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,057
I'm here for the cupcakes.

262
00:11:05,783 --> 00:11:07,901
Dad, I am not on drugs.

263
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:09,105
Oh, nobody thinks that, Shawn.

264
00:11:09,105 --> 00:11:10,652
Well, I'm not completely
sure about that, Doug.

265
00:11:10,652 --> 00:11:12,033
We're all just
a little concerned

266
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:13,397
that you might be
stretching yourself

267
00:11:13,397 --> 00:11:14,380
a bit too thin.

268
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,020
It wasn't my idea,
but he's right, Shawn.

269
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,462
You're acting like a nut job.

270
00:11:17,462 --> 00:11:20,269
Just because I take
Gus' giant dinosaur

271
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:23,153
head down to a dead body
does not make me a nut job.

272
00:11:23,153 --> 00:11:24,440
What?

273
00:11:25,565 --> 00:11:27,178
You took my T-Rex?

274
00:11:27,178 --> 00:11:28,559
My mom gave it to you?

275
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,051
Gladly.

276
00:11:29,051 --> 00:11:31,758
She also gave me some pictures
you can pay me to not show

277
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:32,344
your next girlfriend.

278
00:11:32,344 --> 00:11:33,150
What pictures?

279
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,531
The ones that document
your Terence Trent

280
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:35,747
D'Arby phase.

281
00:11:37,187 --> 00:11:38,226
Whatever, Shawn.

282
00:11:38,226 --> 00:11:40,026
You took Danny Dino
to the police station?

283
00:11:40,026 --> 00:11:42,943
No, Gus, give me some credit.

284
00:11:42,943 --> 00:11:44,581
I took him to the morgue.

285
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:45,889
Good news.

286
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:48,817
Your specifications
were spot on.

287
00:11:49,287 --> 00:11:54,281
Your father tells me you have
delusions of magical powers.

288
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:56,798
Delusions?
Really.

289
00:11:57,826 --> 00:12:00,345
Doug, I'm employed as a psychic.

290
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,776
I've solved 18 cases this year.

291
00:12:02,776 --> 00:12:05,017
I have business cards
and a personalized coffee mug

292
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:06,520
that backs up the whole thing.

293
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,454
I feel things about people.

294
00:12:13,288 --> 00:12:15,951
You, for instance,
are color blind.

295
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:18,183
That's nothing
to be ashamed off.

296
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,903
You're also really stressed
about something.

297
00:12:30,022 --> 00:12:31,381
College.

298
00:12:31,856 --> 00:12:33,823
It can be very expensive, Doug.

299
00:12:33,823 --> 00:12:35,381
Oh, that was good, Henry.

300
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:37,292
Doug, do not be a stooge.

301
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:40,143
Not a stooge, but in this
one case, he was right.

302
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:43,396
Knock at door.

303
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:46,311
Karen, do you mind?

304
00:12:46,311 --> 00:12:47,637
We're in the middle
of an intervention here.

305
00:12:47,637 --> 00:12:48,495
We don't have time for that.

306
00:12:48,495 --> 00:12:49,662
But you're the one
who asked for this.

307
00:12:49,662 --> 00:12:50,436
And I thank you, Henry,

308
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,623
but I'm afraid
that this can't wait.

309
00:12:51,623 --> 00:12:53,153
We just got a break
in the case.

310
00:12:53,153 --> 00:12:55,075
We just found out
the name of the dead man.

311
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:56,821
You want to tell him
who he is, Detective?

312
00:12:56,821 --> 00:12:57,571
No.

313
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:02,089
His name was
Christopher Franzen.

314
00:13:03,568 --> 00:13:06,009
He is a paleontologist.

315
00:13:08,516 --> 00:13:10,847
A dinosaur hunter.

316
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:13,207
As expected.

317
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:14,997
Doug...

318
00:13:14,997 --> 00:13:16,284
pleasure was all mine.

319
00:13:16,284 --> 00:13:17,814
Oh, no, Shawn, mine.

320
00:13:17,814 --> 00:13:19,177
We should get together.

321
00:13:23,994 --> 00:13:25,728
All right, here's
what we know so far.

322
00:13:25,728 --> 00:13:28,966
A man, a paleontology professor,
washes ashore with wounds

323
00:13:28,966 --> 00:13:30,170
specific to a dinosaur.

324
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,891
I don't think we can rule out
the possibility of island

325
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:35,134
somewhere in the Pacific
where dinosaurs do exist.

326
00:13:35,134 --> 00:13:36,979
And have an appetite
for Jeff Goldblum.

327
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:37,805
I'm being serious, Shawn.

328
00:13:37,805 --> 00:13:40,590
Well, look who's Mr. Onboard
and sounding like

329
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,642
a whacked wombat.

330
00:13:41,642 --> 00:13:42,460
Then what is it?

331
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,527
I don't know.

332
00:13:43,527 --> 00:13:46,108
It actually scares me
that my wild dinosaur reach

333
00:13:46,108 --> 00:13:48,004
landed so close
to the bull's-eye.

334
00:13:48,004 --> 00:13:50,844
This guy was possibly killed
by something dinosaur-related,

335
00:13:50,844 --> 00:13:53,308
but it was probably a model
or something from

336
00:13:53,308 --> 00:13:54,534
the archaeology department.

337
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:55,418
We'll have to spend
the better part

338
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,932
of the next 24 hours
sifting through

339
00:13:56,932 --> 00:13:58,379
their entire collection
of artifacts.

340
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,585
And by "we" I mean mostly you.

341
00:14:06,963 --> 00:14:08,418
This is all there is?

342
00:14:08,418 --> 00:14:10,465
No. No, no, no.

343
00:14:10,465 --> 00:14:11,371
This is just the big stuff.

344
00:14:11,371 --> 00:14:13,589
We got the trilobites
in a shoebox,

345
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:16,440
but the shelf is kind of high.

346
00:14:17,894 --> 00:14:20,060
You've got Pinhead, Chatterbox,
Surgeon, and Stitch

347
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,917
up there on a shelf?

348
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:22,740
Shawn, those are Cenobites.

349
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,117
Well, what are trilobites?

350
00:14:24,117 --> 00:14:25,834
Fish fossils.

351
00:14:26,176 --> 00:14:28,740
Oh, Gus, for my sake,
at least pretend like

352
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,458
you don't know this stuff
off the top of your head.

353
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,905
Do this move.

354
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:34,846
Trilo... trilobite?

355
00:14:34,846 --> 00:14:35,616
What... it'll help you!

356
00:14:35,616 --> 00:14:36,287
I'm serious.

357
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,537
Look, Ethan, I can honestly say

358
00:14:38,537 --> 00:14:40,284
there were more
historically significant items

359
00:14:40,284 --> 00:14:43,456
in the lost and found at the Taco
John's in Porterville.

360
00:14:43,456 --> 00:14:44,903
Yeah.

361
00:14:44,903 --> 00:14:46,842
Yeah, it's a little sad.

362
00:14:46,842 --> 00:14:50,864
Word is the whole program
is going under.

363
00:14:50,864 --> 00:14:52,271
You sure about that?

364
00:14:52,271 --> 00:14:54,768
Look, Professor Franzen
would never really give us

365
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:55,657
a straight answer.

366
00:14:55,657 --> 00:14:58,398
In fact, most nights he wasn't
around to give us any answers.

367
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,176
He was a pretty crappy advisor.

368
00:15:00,176 --> 00:15:02,342
And when he did show up,
he was late, tired,

369
00:15:02,342 --> 00:15:03,822
completely disheveled.

370
00:15:03,822 --> 00:15:05,415
Nobody really trusted the guy.

371
00:15:05,415 --> 00:15:08,032
Look, do not ever take
a class from him.

372
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,065
He's dead.

373
00:15:09,065 --> 00:15:10,347
Oh, yeah.

374
00:15:10,347 --> 00:15:12,211
Then totally.

375
00:15:17,998 --> 00:15:19,975
Well, this sure was a dead end.

376
00:15:19,975 --> 00:15:22,353
Yep, but at least we were
the first ones

377
00:15:22,353 --> 00:15:23,867
to find the dead end.

378
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:26,459
Oh, come on!

379
00:15:26,901 --> 00:15:29,067
He really is on fire.

380
00:15:29,067 --> 00:15:30,745
Literally.

381
00:15:33,914 --> 00:15:35,125
I don't get this.

382
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:36,975
The cops beat us
to the dead guy's house.

383
00:15:36,975 --> 00:15:39,141
I don't know how I feel
about the police department

384
00:15:39,141 --> 00:15:40,214
being so proactive.

385
00:15:40,214 --> 00:15:41,747
Feeling the heat?

386
00:15:41,747 --> 00:15:43,604
What, do you think I'm afraid
of a little competition?

387
00:15:43,604 --> 00:15:45,206
I know you're afraid
of competion.

388
00:15:45,206 --> 00:15:47,111
Why else would you have
purposefully broken

389
00:15:47,111 --> 00:15:48,482
the Battlezone at Pizza Royale?

390
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:49,696
Dude, you beat me once.

391
00:15:49,696 --> 00:15:50,892
And only because you first

392
00:15:50,892 --> 00:15:53,301
used the eye piece and then
revealed you had pinkeye.

393
00:15:59,968 --> 00:16:02,388
Let's venture off
the beaten path.

394
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:11,309
What's wrong?

395
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:13,474
I'm just trying to figure out
what to do here,

396
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:15,329
since as a rule we don't
break and enter.

397
00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:16,997
What do you mean
we don't break and enter?

398
00:16:16,997 --> 00:16:18,666
The 2400 Motel.

399
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:19,598
The Hotel de la Cruz.

400
00:16:19,598 --> 00:16:20,735
The spellmaster's box.

401
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,520
Yeah, but we really
shouldn't pick this lock.

402
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,144
You know I want
to pick that lock.

403
00:16:25,144 --> 00:16:26,193
Yes, I do.

404
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,642
Watch out.

405
00:16:32,902 --> 00:16:35,443
What are you, the lock whisper?

406
00:16:37,008 --> 00:16:39,217
Are you channeling
Michael Jackson?

407
00:16:39,634 --> 00:16:41,258
Who heard the second click?

408
00:16:41,258 --> 00:16:42,628
I heard the second click.

409
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,290
Really?

410
00:16:52,362 --> 00:16:53,782
Come on.

411
00:17:00,411 --> 00:17:01,319
I can't see anything.

412
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:03,330
Oh, I got it, I got it.

413
00:17:06,606 --> 00:17:08,694
Gus, that thing is
brighter than the sun.

414
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,031
Think you just gave me glaucoma.

415
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:12,351
You can't give someone
glaucoma.

416
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,652
Thank you.

417
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:20,721
This is better than the entire
university department.

418
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:21,756
It sure is.

419
00:17:21,756 --> 00:17:24,565
And his digging equipment
is some heavy duty stuff.

420
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:26,858
Looks like some shovels
are missing.

421
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,883
Part of a portable light kit.

422
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,040
A lot of brushes.

423
00:17:36,547 --> 00:17:40,248
And fine finishing equipment,
which I would assume

424
00:17:40,248 --> 00:17:41,898
he was only using in the lab.

425
00:17:44,136 --> 00:17:46,412
Dude, I got something.
What?

426
00:17:46,412 --> 00:17:48,251
He was the worst
tic-tac-toe player

427
00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:49,157
in the history of the world.

428
00:17:49,157 --> 00:17:51,725
I'm investigating and you're
analyzing his doodles?

429
00:17:51,725 --> 00:17:54,267
Doodles are the window
to the soul, Gus.

430
00:17:54,593 --> 00:17:56,990
Or maybe that's the epiglottis.

431
00:17:57,922 --> 00:17:58,960
Where's the uvula?

432
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,463
Lassiter's here.

433
00:18:01,016 --> 00:18:03,668
That guy's like five minutes
behind us everywhere we go.

434
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,615
Don't sleep in the nude tonight.

435
00:18:17,537 --> 00:18:18,908
Spencer.

436
00:18:18,908 --> 00:18:20,787
Enjoying your time
riding my behind?

437
00:18:20,787 --> 00:18:22,864
Definitely not in the nude.

438
00:18:22,864 --> 00:18:24,858
This lock looks too high tech
for a backyard shed.

439
00:18:24,858 --> 00:18:26,480
We gotta find somebody
who can crack the code.

440
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,955
There's already someone
here who can do that.

441
00:18:28,955 --> 00:18:31,790
That person... is me.

442
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,076
Well, make yourself useful.

443
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:37,953
I'll need you
to step back, please.

444
00:18:37,953 --> 00:18:39,842
Give me some room to operate.

445
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:44,281
Further, please.

446
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:46,782
Further.

447
00:18:46,782 --> 00:18:47,965
Jules, could you
help me out here?

448
00:18:47,965 --> 00:18:50,263
Just get him back
onto the cobblestone.

449
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,218
That's good, that's good.

450
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:54,754
Thank you.

451
00:18:57,062 --> 00:18:59,681
I am sensing
the first two digits.

452
00:19:01,939 --> 00:19:03,563
What is it, 31?

453
00:19:03,563 --> 00:19:04,712
Gus, help me out here.

454
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:05,806
Come on, buddy.

455
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,175
You can have my
Tony Gwynn rookie. 25.

456
00:19:09,175 --> 00:19:09,925
25!

457
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:15,592
Eight?

458
00:19:15,886 --> 00:19:16,888
Three.

459
00:19:17,363 --> 00:19:18,391
Three!

460
00:19:19,603 --> 00:19:20,708
Four?

461
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:21,443
Two.

462
00:19:21,443 --> 00:19:24,131
And... two.

463
00:19:24,131 --> 00:19:25,481
There's one more.

464
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:27,405
Wait!

465
00:19:27,405 --> 00:19:28,647
There's one more.

466
00:19:29,398 --> 00:19:30,879
Nine.

467
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,008
That was amazing.

468
00:19:45,008 --> 00:19:46,971
I'll give you that one.

469
00:19:50,095 --> 00:19:51,863
Can't see a thing in here.

470
00:19:51,863 --> 00:19:52,493
Oh, I've got it.

471
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:54,660
Wait, I'm sensing a light switch.

472
00:19:57,201 --> 00:19:58,737
Tools are missing.

473
00:19:58,986 --> 00:20:00,680
Good work, Detective.

474
00:20:01,995 --> 00:20:03,675
He had a blunt force
trauma.

475
00:20:03,675 --> 00:20:05,564
That could be supplied
by one of these missing items.

476
00:20:05,564 --> 00:20:09,479
Maybe this rock hammer
or this medium shovel.

477
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:11,103
But where would they be?

478
00:20:11,398 --> 00:20:12,680
The bed of his pickup.

479
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,056
It wasn't parked out front
or at the university.

480
00:20:15,056 --> 00:20:17,615
We find that truck,
we find the murder weapon.

481
00:20:17,615 --> 00:20:18,686
Let's go, O'Hara.

482
00:20:18,686 --> 00:20:19,935
Burning daylight.

483
00:20:20,433 --> 00:20:22,179
Excuse us.

484
00:20:24,444 --> 00:20:26,068
Man, you missed the truck?

485
00:20:26,068 --> 00:20:27,749
I'm not the psychic.

486
00:20:33,327 --> 00:20:34,586
What?

487
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:38,721
Why would someone
frequent a fruit stand

488
00:20:38,721 --> 00:20:40,688
that's over 50 miles away?

489
00:20:41,102 --> 00:20:42,870
They like pomegranate?

490
00:20:54,495 --> 00:20:55,943
Yeah, I know him.

491
00:20:55,943 --> 00:20:57,520
He was my best customer.

492
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,820
Don't know his name.

493
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,444
But he comes by
every night before closing.

494
00:21:01,731 --> 00:21:03,201
Did you ever see
which way he went?

495
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,161
Yeah.

496
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,411
Always up the hill.

497
00:21:06,411 --> 00:21:07,727
That's all I see.

498
00:21:08,003 --> 00:21:10,216
Although every once in a while

499
00:21:10,216 --> 00:21:13,413
I see him come back down the hill
early in the morning.

500
00:21:14,451 --> 00:21:15,840
Well, thank you very much.

501
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,701
Gus, you got anything else?

502
00:21:16,701 --> 00:21:18,558
Yes, is that peach pie in the back?

503
00:21:18,766 --> 00:21:19,270
Yeah.

504
00:21:39,908 --> 00:21:40,910
Another dead end.

505
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,177
Let's turn around.

506
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,483
Hold on a second.

507
00:21:57,093 --> 00:22:00,265
This looks like a place
someone's been sneaking into.

508
00:22:10,816 --> 00:22:11,578
What is this?

509
00:22:12,144 --> 00:22:14,025
Looks like some kind of farmland

510
00:22:14,025 --> 00:22:15,231
or grazing plain.

511
00:22:15,526 --> 00:22:16,497
Oh, look at that.

512
00:22:16,989 --> 00:22:19,598
It's like that movie.
The one with Sigourney Weaver.

513
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,464
- Aliens?
- No.

514
00:22:21,464 --> 00:22:23,369
- Alien.
- No.

515
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:24,476
Alien: Resurrection.

516
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,696
Gus, the one with the holes
and Shia LaBeouf.

517
00:22:26,696 --> 00:22:28,099
They had holes in Shia LaBeouf?

518
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,034
The holes are in the ground,
dude, like that.

519
00:22:31,034 --> 00:22:33,571
And Jon Voight was walking
around all crazy.

520
00:22:33,571 --> 00:22:34,727
Oh,Anaconda.

521
00:22:35,477 --> 00:22:36,829
Yeah, never mind.

522
00:22:36,829 --> 00:22:37,796
Gorillas in the Mist?

523
00:22:38,418 --> 00:22:39,931
- Death and the Maiden?
- No!

524
00:22:40,287 --> 00:22:41,058
Half Moon Street?

525
00:22:41,058 --> 00:22:42,767
Just let it go.

526
00:22:47,817 --> 00:22:49,158
I'll be damned.

527
00:22:49,895 --> 00:22:50,203
What?!

528
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,771
Somebody's shooting at us!

529
00:22:54,253 --> 00:22:55,596
Oh, God! They're shooting!

530
00:22:55,596 --> 00:22:57,020
We're gonna die!

531
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,794
Run, Gus!

532
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:59,239
Gus, run like the wind!

533
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:00,825
No... get... get up!

534
00:23:06,702 --> 00:23:08,583
Come on, get in the car!

535
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,034
Hurry up, Shawn!

536
00:23:10,784 --> 00:23:11,795
Start it, start it!

537
00:23:12,536 --> 00:23:13,642
Go, go, go!

538
00:23:14,007 --> 00:23:16,503
Dude, look at the road
while you're driving!

539
00:23:16,503 --> 00:23:18,611
- I'm staying down for safety.
- He was shooting

540
00:23:18,611 --> 00:23:19,914
directly into the air, Gus.

541
00:23:19,914 --> 00:23:21,548
Bullets go up. They have to come down.

542
00:23:21,548 --> 00:23:23,867
Do you know what the trajectory
would have to be for that to happen?

543
00:23:23,867 --> 00:23:25,527
Don't you dare argue physics with me.

544
00:23:25,527 --> 00:23:27,581
Not while we're in the process
of almost being killed.

545
00:23:36,187 --> 00:23:38,486
Didn't you see the
"Trespassers Will Be Shot" sign?

546
00:23:40,201 --> 00:23:41,265
Oh, yeah.

547
00:23:41,265 --> 00:23:42,673
It totally said that.

548
00:23:43,244 --> 00:23:44,254
My bad.

549
00:23:49,165 --> 00:23:51,995
Mr. Spencer, if you have any
substantial information concerning

550
00:23:51,995 --> 00:23:55,006
the Christopher Franzen case,
please get on with it.

551
00:23:55,006 --> 00:23:56,790
I've got something.

552
00:23:57,949 --> 00:23:58,957
It's a cluck.

553
00:23:59,227 --> 00:24:00,236
A cluck?

554
00:24:04,978 --> 00:24:06,072
Actually there's two.

555
00:24:06,072 --> 00:24:07,130
Two clucks.

556
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,652
A cluck-cluck here.

557
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:16,525
A bawk-bawk... there.

558
00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:18,680
Here a bawk.
There a...

559
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,245
Cluck?

560
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:22,522
Everywhere a bawk-baaawk.

561
00:24:22,522 --> 00:24:24,022
Let me guess. You have a name.

562
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,149
MacDonald, perhaps?

563
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:28,252
No. No, it's a farm.

564
00:24:28,252 --> 00:24:29,648
With a farmer. An old farmer.

565
00:24:29,648 --> 00:24:31,950
Farmer... Shooty Pants.

566
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:33,103
That's a nickname.

567
00:24:33,103 --> 00:24:35,306
- I don't think that's his actual handle.
- I've got it.

568
00:24:35,306 --> 00:24:37,317
Lassiter found
the paleontologist's truck.

569
00:24:37,317 --> 00:24:38,891
- You helped.
- I did help.

570
00:24:38,891 --> 00:24:39,874
It was his hunch.

571
00:24:39,874 --> 00:24:42,089
It was down at the old marina.
I just had a feeling.

572
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:45,095
I also found the prints of a certain
grad student named Ethan Robinson

573
00:24:45,095 --> 00:24:48,574
along with a stack of letters from said
grad students demanding the professor

574
00:24:48,574 --> 00:24:49,923
stop ruining his life.

575
00:24:49,923 --> 00:24:51,783
We're sending a car over
to pick him up.

576
00:24:52,927 --> 00:24:55,281
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting your trance?

577
00:24:55,901 --> 00:24:56,909
I don't buy it.

578
00:24:56,909 --> 00:24:57,684
Which part?

579
00:24:57,897 --> 00:25:00,638
The damning evidence
or the murder weapon?

580
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:04,232
There's more going on in
this guy's life. Chief, I'm sensing...

581
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:09,360
digging.

582
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,469
Yeah, the archaeology
department was going under.

583
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:12,784
He was trying to make a big discovery.

584
00:25:12,784 --> 00:25:14,752
Put him on the map, get more funding.

585
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,901
The farm.

586
00:25:15,901 --> 00:25:17,551
I can see the name of the farm.

587
00:25:17,551 --> 00:25:19,135
It's Wallll...

588
00:25:19,788 --> 00:25:21,841
Wall...

589
00:25:22,314 --> 00:25:26,978
Walker Farms. Yeah, we got that lead
off the phone records... Yesterday.

590
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,383
Apparently our victim made
a series of phone calls

591
00:25:29,383 --> 00:25:32,474
to the farmer trying to buy some
of his land, but it wasn't for sale.

592
00:25:32,474 --> 00:25:34,636
Farmer was forthcoming, cooperative.

593
00:25:34,636 --> 00:25:35,791
Definitely not a suspect.

594
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:36,996
Anything else?

595
00:25:37,408 --> 00:25:39,941
I have to say,
you have been very through.

596
00:25:40,346 --> 00:25:42,339
We're just doing what
any good cops would do.

597
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:53,784
- Shawn, what are you doing?
- Yeah, what are we doing, Shawn?

598
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,907
- I need to borrow some tools.
- What kind of tools?

599
00:25:56,907 --> 00:25:59,746
Digging tools. A little excavation
project we got going on.

600
00:25:59,746 --> 00:26:02,591
- Are you still on that dinosaur thing?
- We're still on that dinosaur thing?

601
00:26:02,591 --> 00:26:05,560
What, is there an echo in here?
Yes, we're still on the dinosaur thing.

602
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,699
We step foot on the far end
of this guy Walker's farm in Ojai

603
00:26:08,699 --> 00:26:10,494
and he starts blasting us
with buckshot.

604
00:26:10,494 --> 00:26:13,036
We know our dead guy was there
every night leading up to his death,

605
00:26:13,036 --> 00:26:15,223
digging around the periphery
of this property.

606
00:26:15,223 --> 00:26:17,012
No, Shawn, wait.

607
00:26:17,012 --> 00:26:18,575
I don't want you borrowing my tools.

608
00:26:18,575 --> 00:26:20,638
Oh, Gus will leave
his class ring as collateral.

609
00:26:20,638 --> 00:26:21,412
- No, I won't.
- Yes, you will.

610
00:26:21,412 --> 00:26:22,338
- No, I won't.
- Sure you will.

611
00:26:22,338 --> 00:26:22,938
No, I won't.

612
00:26:22,938 --> 00:26:24,168
I can't support this.

613
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:26,034
Well, there's a shocker.

614
00:26:26,415 --> 00:26:27,583
You not being supportive.

615
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:28,628
Would you shut up and listen?

616
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:31,777
I'm saying I can't support you going
somewhere where you could get shot.

617
00:26:32,469 --> 00:26:34,486
What, are you...
Are you worried about me?

618
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:36,858
Shawn, I've been worried about you
since you were three years old

619
00:26:36,858 --> 00:26:39,119
and started eating your own toenails.

620
00:26:39,614 --> 00:26:40,783
Well,

621
00:26:40,783 --> 00:26:42,095
Dad, I'll be fine, okay?

622
00:26:42,095 --> 00:26:43,596
We're not gonna go
anywhere near the house.

623
00:26:43,596 --> 00:26:46,818
And if it'll make you feel any better,
I will stand behind Gus the entire time.

624
00:26:46,818 --> 00:26:47,646
- No, you won't.
- Yes, I will.

625
00:26:47,646 --> 00:26:48,839
- No, you won't.
- Oh, yes, I will.

626
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:49,269
You want to bet?

627
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:50,317
I don't like it.

628
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,754
It doesn't feel right.

629
00:26:52,586 --> 00:26:53,620
I know feelings.

630
00:26:53,975 --> 00:26:56,110
Pardon me? Did...

631
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,163
Did you just say... "I know feelings"?

632
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,097
Perfect.

633
00:27:05,097 --> 00:27:06,425
This will be easy.

634
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,248
Oh, there's a pattern here.

635
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:10,141
Those guys dig with a reason.

636
00:27:10,363 --> 00:27:11,371
How do you know that?

637
00:27:11,577 --> 00:27:15,204
Gus, I worked at the museum for almost
an entire weekend before I got canned.

638
00:27:17,164 --> 00:27:19,722
<i>He was the worst tic-tac-toe player
in the history of the world.</i>

639
00:27:20,602 --> 00:27:21,610
Wait a second.

640
00:27:22,803 --> 00:27:24,247
Those weren't tic-tac-toe boards.

641
00:27:24,247 --> 00:27:25,932
Those were all the places he'd dug.

642
00:27:25,932 --> 00:27:27,463
There were like 25 Xs.

643
00:27:27,463 --> 00:27:28,880
No way he scored that often.

644
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,379
The Xs were misses.

645
00:27:30,379 --> 00:27:33,319
In this case, "O" marks the spot.

646
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:45,427
And that's the "O."

647
00:27:54,655 --> 00:27:56,825
This is the only hole
filled by a bulldozer.

648
00:27:57,256 --> 00:28:00,173
No self-respecting paleontologist
would use a bulldozer.

649
00:28:01,865 --> 00:28:02,886
Why do you know that?

650
00:28:03,095 --> 00:28:04,238
Because, Shawn, if you use a bull...

651
00:28:04,238 --> 00:28:07,079
- Gus, I don't actually want to know.
- Then don't ask.

652
00:28:08,362 --> 00:28:09,948
This shouldn't take long. Grab a shovel.

653
00:28:12,072 --> 00:28:14,158
And keep an eye out for that farmer.

654
00:28:22,214 --> 00:28:25,285
- How you doing on your side?
- Good, solid.

655
00:28:26,109 --> 00:28:27,142
I'm holding up.

656
00:28:28,138 --> 00:28:29,195
- Shawn!
- What?

657
00:28:29,638 --> 00:28:32,562
I'm keeping watch.
That's how the other guy died.

658
00:28:33,431 --> 00:28:35,509
What, you're not concerned?

659
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,048
All right, I get it!

660
00:28:41,192 --> 00:28:42,200
It's my turn.

661
00:28:48,242 --> 00:28:49,971
This is the end of the loose dirt.
Be careful.

662
00:28:56,524 --> 00:28:57,593
This is weird.

663
00:28:58,341 --> 00:28:59,978
What, that there's rocks in the ground?

664
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,532
These aren't rocks.

665
00:29:03,247 --> 00:29:04,472
These are fossils.

666
00:29:04,768 --> 00:29:07,363
But they've been processed,
finished off, residue,

667
00:29:07,363 --> 00:29:08,445
rocks chipped away.

668
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:10,835
Stuff you would normally do in a lab.

669
00:29:11,389 --> 00:29:13,073
Franzen found something.

670
00:29:15,382 --> 00:29:16,957
Why wouldn't he just take it out

671
00:29:16,957 --> 00:29:19,774
and do the work in the lab
where it should be done?

672
00:29:22,203 --> 00:29:23,494
Unless...

673
00:29:24,318 --> 00:29:25,757
Unless it was too big to move.

674
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:29,556
Oh, dude, I'm gonna get the leaf blower.

675
00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:31,735
You brought a leaf blower?

676
00:29:46,516 --> 00:29:47,943
You gotta be kidding me.

677
00:29:49,258 --> 00:29:51,201
I just discovered a dinosaur.

678
00:29:58,668 --> 00:30:01,433
Filling that hole was
the worst idea ever.

679
00:30:02,776 --> 00:30:03,981
It had to be done, Gus.

680
00:30:03,981 --> 00:30:06,723
We have to save it for when
we unmask Franzen's killer.

681
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:08,628
I still don't get it.

682
00:30:09,082 --> 00:30:12,211
He was on the trail of
a fossil graveyard.

683
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:14,160
It lead him right to Deacon Farms.

684
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,800
Farmer wouldn't let him
dig on the land, so

685
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,641
he takes matters into his
own hands after hours.

686
00:30:20,145 --> 00:30:22,469
But why wouldn't the farmer let him dig?

687
00:30:22,469 --> 00:30:24,446
Maybe he didn't want his farm disturbed.

688
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:29,347
A dig like that is worth
millions to a land owner.

689
00:30:29,347 --> 00:30:32,177
And the fossils I discovered
weren't even on crop land.

690
00:30:32,177 --> 00:30:33,245
You discovered?

691
00:30:33,245 --> 00:30:35,380
Don't try to take away
my dinosaur discovery, Shawn.

692
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,223
I wouldn't dream of it.

693
00:30:36,223 --> 00:30:38,633
I'm sorry. It was all you.
I'm very proud of you.

694
00:30:39,455 --> 00:30:41,582
Don't you think once
they unearth that thing

695
00:30:41,582 --> 00:30:44,577
there would be a swarm of people
crashing in from all over the world?

696
00:30:44,577 --> 00:30:46,318
Why didn't he just lease the land?

697
00:30:46,318 --> 00:30:47,729
I don't get it.

698
00:30:48,824 --> 00:30:51,356
- I've got an idea.
- What?

699
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:52,819
Let's ask him.

700
00:30:52,819 --> 00:30:54,005
What?!

701
00:30:54,005 --> 00:30:56,317
We're pretty sure we just found
a cold-blooded murderer,

702
00:30:56,317 --> 00:30:58,321
and you want to go to his house
and ask him about it?

703
00:30:58,321 --> 00:30:59,895
We can ask nicely.
No!

704
00:30:59,895 --> 00:31:02,431
All right, all right.
We come up with a cover story.

705
00:31:03,021 --> 00:31:04,075
We're vacuum salesmen.

706
00:31:04,075 --> 00:31:05,132
No...

707
00:31:05,415 --> 00:31:06,645
Traveling gypsies.

708
00:31:06,645 --> 00:31:07,965
No, no, no!

709
00:31:08,686 --> 00:31:10,211
We'll do Of Mice and Men.

710
00:31:10,506 --> 00:31:12,143
- I'm Lennie.
- No.

711
00:31:12,143 --> 00:31:15,799
"George, you said that I could
take care of those rabbits, George."

712
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:16,328
Shawn.

713
00:31:16,328 --> 00:31:18,789
"And later on you're gonna
cook those beets. "

714
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:19,379
Shawn!

715
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:20,536
"Beets make me go... "

716
00:31:20,536 --> 00:31:21,741
No Lennie.

717
00:31:21,741 --> 00:31:25,018
Gus, you know how long
I've been waiting to pull out my Lennie?

718
00:31:25,018 --> 00:31:28,521
No, Shawn, we do the National
Paleontology Society thing as agreed.

719
00:31:28,521 --> 00:31:30,401
And we keep it very, very simple.

720
00:31:30,401 --> 00:31:32,578
It's not as much fun as
whipping out my Lennie.

721
00:31:33,271 --> 00:31:34,539
And why are we stopping here?

722
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:35,964
Have you tried these peaches?

723
00:31:38,374 --> 00:31:39,375
You're back.

724
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:40,445
Yes, sir, we are.

725
00:31:40,445 --> 00:31:41,868
We're addicted to your citrus.

726
00:31:41,868 --> 00:31:44,049
Peaches aren't citrus, Shawn.
They're stone fruit.

727
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:45,841
- It's the same thing.
- No, not the same thing.

728
00:31:45,841 --> 00:31:48,279
They have pits.
Peaches, cherries, plums, and apricots.

729
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:51,909
I can't do this with you right now.
Does your fruit come from Walker Farms?

730
00:31:52,186 --> 00:31:55,075
Oh, no. We grow on our own
little parcel of land.

731
00:31:55,297 --> 00:31:58,951
Deacon Walker's farm used to be
a supplier of ours years ago,

732
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:01,472
but they don't grow nearly
as much as they used to.

733
00:32:03,429 --> 00:32:05,361
Thank you so much for your information.

734
00:32:05,361 --> 00:32:08,853
If you have a moment, my friend and I
would like to buy every peach on that truck.

735
00:32:08,853 --> 00:32:10,231
Including the one you're eating.

736
00:32:18,408 --> 00:32:20,109
You sure you don't want
to do Of Mice And Men?

737
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:22,939
You so much as slur one word,
I'll give you an Indian burn so hot

738
00:32:22,939 --> 00:32:24,375
your socks will catch fire.

739
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,523
"Indian burn. "

740
00:32:25,782 --> 00:32:27,665
I haven't been threatened
with that this millennium.

741
00:32:27,665 --> 00:32:29,312
Take a shot if your ulna feels safe.

742
00:32:29,976 --> 00:32:32,005
I don't think the ulna's in the forearm.

743
00:32:32,294 --> 00:32:33,242
Trust me, it is.

744
00:32:34,064 --> 00:32:36,818
- How can you Indian burn a bone?
- Stop analyzing my threat.

745
00:32:36,818 --> 00:32:38,423
- Get it right.
- I got it right.

746
00:32:39,288 --> 00:32:41,399
- Deacon Walker?
- Sullivan Walker.

747
00:32:41,809 --> 00:32:43,346
Is Deacon Walker home?

748
00:32:43,346 --> 00:32:44,919
There is no Deacon Walker.

749
00:32:45,571 --> 00:32:46,624
That's confusing.

750
00:32:48,668 --> 00:32:50,463
I've got nothing.
Gus?

751
00:32:50,713 --> 00:32:53,080
Then why name the farm
Deacon Walker Farms?

752
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,711
Because it used to be called
Deacon Walker.

753
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:56,162
Roger Deacon was my partner.

754
00:32:56,162 --> 00:32:57,121
He's not anymore.

755
00:32:57,989 --> 00:32:59,267
That cleans it up nicely.

756
00:32:59,267 --> 00:33:01,063
- Maybe we come in?
- No.

757
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:02,095
What do you want?

758
00:33:02,095 --> 00:33:04,419
We're from the National
Paleontological Society...

759
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:05,403
Not interested.

760
00:33:08,132 --> 00:33:09,988
Clearly he's not interested.

761
00:33:14,562 --> 00:33:15,509
We would like to make you

762
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:18,091
a very sizeable offer
on a very small portion of your...

763
00:33:26,973 --> 00:33:29,026
Hello, my name is Lennie.

764
00:33:29,026 --> 00:33:30,126
I like to...

765
00:33:34,709 --> 00:33:36,664
You think he'd open up
if we knocked again?

766
00:33:41,983 --> 00:33:44,109
I'm glad it only took us
an hour to get up here.

767
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:45,767
Not like I wasted a whole day.

768
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:50,117
Franzen dug up here too?

769
00:34:01,637 --> 00:34:02,647
No, he didn't.

770
00:34:03,088 --> 00:34:05,338
These are all new and
dug with a bulldozer.

771
00:34:05,338 --> 00:34:06,508
A real paleontologist...

772
00:34:06,508 --> 00:34:09,114
would never use such an indelicate tool.
I got it.

773
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,699
- So our farmer's been digging too.
- Right.

774
00:34:13,278 --> 00:34:17,103
But if the gold mine's out there,
why is he digging over here?

775
00:34:23,768 --> 00:34:24,580
It's my dad.

776
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,368
Think he wants his leaf blower back?

777
00:34:28,482 --> 00:34:29,330
Shawn?

778
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:31,531
Shawn, you're not anywhere
near that farmhouse, are you?

779
00:34:31,531 --> 00:34:33,257
Dad, how dare you? Of course not.

780
00:34:33,257 --> 00:34:34,510
Good.
Stay away, Shawn.

781
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,886
I know where I rember that farm.

782
00:34:35,886 --> 00:34:38,899
Deacon Walker Farm.
I was up there about 20 years ago.

783
00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:41,303
A girl reported that
her boyfriend went missing.

784
00:34:41,303 --> 00:34:42,582
Roger Deacon.

785
00:34:42,582 --> 00:34:44,309
He was a partner in the farm.

786
00:34:44,309 --> 00:34:45,748
He was never found, Shawn.

787
00:34:45,748 --> 00:34:47,010
Never found?

788
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:49,776
That's right, the farmer claimed he
went back to England or some nonsense.

789
00:34:49,776 --> 00:34:51,990
The point is, we never found out
where he went.

790
00:34:52,592 --> 00:34:54,122
I think I might know where he is.

791
00:34:54,122 --> 00:34:55,180
Where?

792
00:34:55,597 --> 00:34:57,506
- I might be looking at him.
- Shawn!

793
00:34:57,506 --> 00:34:58,563
Gotta go.

794
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,762
Shawn!
God...

795
00:35:01,794 --> 00:35:03,331
- Dude.
- What?

796
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:09,256
It now appears a lot of our
evidence is circumstantial.

797
00:35:09,256 --> 00:35:11,520
We're checking the grad
student's alibi, but...

798
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,291
I'm not as confident
as I like to be.

799
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:15,616
- Shawn Spencer's on line one.
- What does he want?

800
00:35:15,616 --> 00:35:18,357
He wants us to go meet him
in the Ojai Valley somewhere.

801
00:35:18,357 --> 00:35:20,214
We're in the middle
of the Franzen case.

802
00:35:20,214 --> 00:35:21,395
I told him that.

803
00:35:21,395 --> 00:35:24,209
He guarantees that in ten minutes
he can solve the case,

804
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:27,676
nab the killer, close an additional
unsolved murder, and...

805
00:35:29,353 --> 00:35:30,558
And what?

806
00:35:31,714 --> 00:35:33,202
Unearth a dinosaur.

807
00:35:33,644 --> 00:35:36,263
Well... I'm curious.

808
00:35:45,765 --> 00:35:49,944
This is as far as my property goes.
That's all there is.

809
00:35:50,917 --> 00:35:53,487
Well, I've answered
all your questions, Detective.

810
00:35:53,929 --> 00:35:55,466
What more do you want from me?

811
00:35:55,929 --> 00:35:58,539
- I'm not entirely sure, sir.
- We just have one more person

812
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:00,051
we need you to talk to.

813
00:36:03,005 --> 00:36:04,013
Lennie?

814
00:36:04,824 --> 00:36:05,833
Lennie?

815
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:07,050
Don't even ask.

816
00:36:08,322 --> 00:36:10,222
My name is not Lennie, Mr. Walker.

817
00:36:10,222 --> 00:36:11,542
But if it were,

818
00:36:11,542 --> 00:36:13,347
- I would've been amazing.
- No, you wouldn't have.

819
00:36:13,347 --> 00:36:14,595
Would've brought tears, Gus.

820
00:36:14,595 --> 00:36:15,697
Guys, the point?

821
00:36:16,063 --> 00:36:18,000
The truth is...

822
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,156
I'm a psychic.

823
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:21,339
I work for the SBPD.

824
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:22,769
And the mystic vibrations

825
00:36:22,769 --> 00:36:24,117
of the sea have brought me here

826
00:36:24,117 --> 00:36:28,547
to solve not one,
but two murders.

827
00:36:28,929 --> 00:36:29,995
You're a what?

828
00:36:29,995 --> 00:36:32,978
Christopher Franzen was
a persistent annoyance, huh?

829
00:36:32,978 --> 00:36:34,219
He couldn't help it.

830
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:35,987
His department was going under.

831
00:36:35,987 --> 00:36:38,130
He was desperate to find
something significant

832
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,665
to save his career.

833
00:36:39,665 --> 00:36:42,764
And he knew that your property
held the key.

834
00:36:42,764 --> 00:36:44,836
But you wouldn't let him dig.

835
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:47,395
You couldn't let him dig.

836
00:36:47,395 --> 00:36:50,162
So he did what any
self-respecting paleontologist

837
00:36:50,162 --> 00:36:52,648
on the verge of a nervous
breakdown would do.

838
00:36:52,648 --> 00:36:54,711
He dug anyway.

839
00:36:55,633 --> 00:36:56,788
Secretly.

840
00:36:56,788 --> 00:36:58,064
Under the blanket of night.

841
00:36:58,064 --> 00:37:00,103
And into the early morning.

842
00:37:00,103 --> 00:37:05,328
And he dug, and he dug,
and he found something.

843
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:15,067
And that's when you found him.
You knew the magnitude

844
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:16,249
of the find.

845
00:37:16,249 --> 00:37:18,643
Once word got out,
you'd never be able to keep

846
00:37:18,643 --> 00:37:20,401
the rest of the world
from digging here too.

847
00:37:20,401 --> 00:37:22,050
And you couldn't have
the rest of the world

848
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,677
digging here either,
could you?

849
00:37:23,677 --> 00:37:24,770
Shawn!

850
00:37:25,511 --> 00:37:26,539
Dad?

851
00:37:26,539 --> 00:37:27,533
What are you doing here?

852
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:29,073
I was worried.

853
00:37:29,073 --> 00:37:30,864
About my tools.

854
00:37:31,594 --> 00:37:32,782
What?

855
00:37:32,782 --> 00:37:34,516
If I had known you were
finally smart enough

856
00:37:34,516 --> 00:37:35,754
to bring some backup,
I wouldn't have had

857
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:36,571
to come up here, Shawn.

858
00:37:36,571 --> 00:37:38,903
Shawn, will you tell them
why Walker wouldn't let him dig?

859
00:37:38,903 --> 00:37:40,493
Roger Deacon.

860
00:37:41,304 --> 00:37:43,348
Deacon is buried
on the property!

861
00:37:43,348 --> 00:37:44,294
Dad!

862
00:37:44,294 --> 00:37:47,119
Dad, you just blew
the big reveal.

863
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,127
You already mentioned
his name, Shawn.

864
00:37:49,127 --> 00:37:50,883
No, Deacon
was the partner

865
00:37:50,883 --> 00:37:52,394
Walker killed 20 years ago.

866
00:37:52,394 --> 00:37:54,642
- Hey, now wait a minute here...
- He what now?

867
00:37:55,553 --> 00:37:58,106
Yeah, he killed Deacon
and he buried him

868
00:37:58,106 --> 00:38:00,414
somewhere on the farm
and he can't rember where.

869
00:38:00,414 --> 00:38:02,402
Isn't that right,
Farmer Shooty Pants?

870
00:38:02,402 --> 00:38:04,944
I don't have to stand here
and take this.

871
00:38:04,944 --> 00:38:06,670
No, actually you do.

872
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:08,703
What does this have to do
with Christopher Franzen?

873
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,791
He killed Franzen when he caught
him standing above his

874
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:13,693
dinosaur skull discovery,
sending him flying right into

875
00:38:13,693 --> 00:38:15,598
the teeth of the dinosaur.

876
00:38:15,598 --> 00:38:16,990
But he couldn't bury him here.

877
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,902
No, no, no,
he had called the farm.

878
00:38:18,902 --> 00:38:20,393
He had snooped around the farm.

879
00:38:20,393 --> 00:38:21,436
There was a trail to the farm.

880
00:38:21,436 --> 00:38:24,409
No, he had to dump him somewhere
where there'd be no forensics.

881
00:38:24,409 --> 00:38:27,091
Like the ocean.

882
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:31,270
Just let the salt water clean
the corpse and wash it ashore.

883
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,828
And the murder scene.

884
00:38:32,828 --> 00:38:35,270
Well, he hopped on
his handy bulldozer

885
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,091
and filled the hole.

886
00:38:37,966 --> 00:38:40,430
I'm getting a bad feeling
about your streak.

887
00:38:40,846 --> 00:38:42,294
You too, huh?

888
00:38:42,563 --> 00:38:44,182
I think I need a lawyer.

889
00:38:44,182 --> 00:38:45,436
I think you're right.

890
00:38:45,436 --> 00:38:46,541
Put your hands
behind your back.

891
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:47,726
- What?
- You heard me.

892
00:38:47,726 --> 00:38:48,793
You still haven't answered
the question

893
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,495
why he dug all the holes
around the house, Shawn.

894
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:53,476
Dad, that's the finale.

895
00:38:53,476 --> 00:38:56,001
That's why I don't invite you
to these things.

896
00:38:57,463 --> 00:39:00,584
He was looking
for Deacon's body.

897
00:39:00,584 --> 00:39:01,667
Whatever.

898
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:02,948
Are we done here, Mr. Spencer?

899
00:39:02,948 --> 00:39:04,639
No, we're not done.

900
00:39:04,904 --> 00:39:06,932
For my final demonstration...

901
00:39:08,661 --> 00:39:11,687
I will now...
discover a dinosaur.

902
00:39:11,687 --> 00:39:13,290
Shawn!

903
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:17,695
Actually... Gus will discover
a dinosaur.

904
00:39:18,284 --> 00:39:19,610
Wait a second.

905
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,416
You just want me
to dig this hole.

906
00:39:21,416 --> 00:39:22,593
I do not.

907
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:24,162
I'm not falling
for that, Shawny boy.

908
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:25,350
You dig it.

909
00:39:25,925 --> 00:39:27,173
I'll take credit
for the discovery.

910
00:39:27,173 --> 00:39:28,935
Oh, no, you won't.
Give me that shovel.

911
00:39:29,174 --> 00:39:30,180
It's too late.

912
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,550
You blew it.
What?!

913
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,030
And whoever discovers it
gets to name it.

914
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,322
I'm naming him Zippy.

915
00:39:34,322 --> 00:39:35,869
Or Chompy.

916
00:39:35,869 --> 00:39:38,681
Zippy the Dinosaur,
discovered by psychic

917
00:39:38,681 --> 00:39:40,228
paleo-sleuth Shawn Spencer!

918
00:39:40,228 --> 00:39:42,228
Give me this shovel,
Shawn!

919
00:39:53,687 --> 00:39:55,300
Killed by a dinosaur.

920
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:56,989
And he's right.

921
00:39:56,989 --> 00:39:58,768
It was an actual dinosaur.

922
00:39:58,768 --> 00:40:00,237
Technically, it's the fall

923
00:40:00,237 --> 00:40:01,408
that killed him.

924
00:40:01,408 --> 00:40:02,657
Not helping.

925
00:40:04,231 --> 00:40:05,657
Who am I kidding?
I am doomed.

926
00:40:05,657 --> 00:40:07,850
I am never gonna suspect
an extinct creature.

927
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,032
How can I compete with that?

928
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,126
You don't have to compete.

929
00:40:10,126 --> 00:40:12,800
O'Hara, I am physically incapable
of pointing the finger

930
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,125
at a dragon or a leprechaun
or the Loch Ness Monster.

931
00:40:16,758 --> 00:40:18,847
I quit. I'm gonna donate
my badge to charity.

932
00:40:18,847 --> 00:40:21,973
It was a good run, Carlton.
All streaks have to end.

933
00:40:21,973 --> 00:40:24,159
Lou Boudreau fielded
the ball cleanly.

934
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:25,577
You have to let it go.

935
00:40:26,207 --> 00:40:27,806
Who the hell is Lou Boudreau?

936
00:40:27,806 --> 00:40:30,689
He recorded the out that ended
DiMaggio's hit streak.

937
00:40:30,689 --> 00:40:31,705
Don't you watch baseball?

938
00:40:31,705 --> 00:40:32,700
Of course I watch baseball.

939
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,771
I just don't know meaningless

940
00:40:33,771 --> 00:40:35,771
- facts from 75 years ago.
- 66.

941
00:40:35,771 --> 00:40:37,231
You disturb me.

942
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:40,922
Do you need a hug?

943
00:40:40,922 --> 00:40:42,707
Oh, what do I look like?

944
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,515
Yeah, I'll take the hug.

945
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,260
Okay, thanks.
Okay.

946
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,130
Oh, come on, you guys.

947
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,483
We're still doing
this intervention thing?

948
00:41:05,483 --> 00:41:07,476
Yes, yes, Shawn,
we are.

949
00:41:07,742 --> 00:41:10,637
Son, you have no sense
of responsibility.

950
00:41:11,012 --> 00:41:13,598
And lately you've been
purposefully putting yourself

951
00:41:13,598 --> 00:41:15,486
in a severe amount
of unnecessary danger.

952
00:41:15,486 --> 00:41:17,958
On top of which, you are
constantly belittling

953
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:19,315
the good work of...
Actually, Henry,

954
00:41:19,315 --> 00:41:21,187
I stretched the truth a bit.

955
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,943
This isn't about Shawn.

956
00:41:23,518 --> 00:41:25,689
- This is about you.
- What?

957
00:41:25,921 --> 00:41:29,148
Can we talk about your obsessive
need for control?

958
00:41:29,148 --> 00:41:31,551
You come into my house,
Devette.

959
00:41:31,551 --> 00:41:33,081
You lie to me?!

960
00:41:33,081 --> 00:41:34,459
Let's try to be rational.

961
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:37,879
Did you really drive all the
way up to Ojai just to crash

962
00:41:37,879 --> 00:41:39,723
Shawn's crowning moment?

963
00:41:40,408 --> 00:41:41,457
Get out.

964
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:42,999
Henry, we're here for you.

965
00:41:42,999 --> 00:41:45,369
- At least listen.
- Out now.

966
00:41:46,302 --> 00:41:47,384
Get out!

967
00:41:48,984 --> 00:41:50,015
Out!

968
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:51,551
I'd like to start.

969
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:54,645
When I was about seven, he...

970

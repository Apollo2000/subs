00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,260
Shh.

3
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,660
Shh. Yeah.

4
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,380
Yeah.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,660
Yeah, easy. Easy.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,370
Oh.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,910
It's not fair, this life.

8
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,800
I know you deserve better.

9
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,200
Best I can offer you is peace.

10
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,179
_

11
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,570
The things we lose to keep you fed.

12
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,740
Jesus, that's John Dutton.

13
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,420
Commissioner, you all right?

15
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,720
The state of Montana has
never gauged its progress

16
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,450
by the size of its cities.

17
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,390
We measure our progress

18
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,690
by how those cities impact the people

19
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,830
and the land surrounding them,

20
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,790
the land that feeds them,

21
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,920
provides their water,
nourishes their souls.

22
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,410
This doesn't sound like a
legal argument, Mr. Dutton.

23
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,170
It sounds like a lecture.

24
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,250
Well, it's a summation of
our state constitution,

25
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,319
which clearly states
that land preservation

26
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,970
and property rights take precedence

27
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,380
over public expansion.

28
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,610
The constitution clearly denotes

29
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,310
the state's right to eminent domain

30
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,550
and grants the authority
to condemn property

31
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,620
for the public good.

32
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,120
For essential public services

33
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,320
like hospitals, schools, highways...

34
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,990
not housing developments.

35
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,520
Housing is essential.

36
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,190
Bozeman has doubled in size in a decade.

37
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,000
We're 30 miles away,

38
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,030
and our population is less
than it was 40 years ago.

39
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,930
- Why?
- Because their fence guarantees

40
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,280
we don't grow.

41
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,670
Stagnation is death for a town,

42
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,540
and the Duttons are the ones killing it.

43
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,540
Well, poetic if it were true,

44
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,680
since a Dutton founded the town.

45
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,340
As it stands, the defendant is correct.

46
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,000
Our land use laws are quite clear.

47
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,080
For this commission to
grant eminent domain,

48
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,890
you must show public need, not desire.

49
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,660
I think that's enough posturing.

50
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,700
- Let's put it to a vote.
- The plaintiff hasn't shown

51
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,190
any legal imperative for a vote,

52
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,900
so this case is dismissed.

53
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,180
It's 30,000 acres, Jamie.

54
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,209
That isn't a fraction of the ranch.

55
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,710
Okay, look, you can
harvest the timber first,

56
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,110
no environmental review, nothing.

57
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,840
You can cut every tree to the root.

58
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,920
You want to suggest to my father

59
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,920
that he clear-cut his land, be my guest.

60
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,400
You're a braver man than me.

61
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,180
Just mention it, Jamie.

62
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,260
The town grows, or it dies.

63
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,560
Well, maybe it should grow... up.

64
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,800
Condos, Alan, like they
have in San Francisco.

65
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,840
Condos?

66
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,710
Who wants to live in a condo in Montana?

67
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,220
I don't know how you're gonna
get 'em out by yourself.

68
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,500
Don't have to get 'em all out.

69
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,690
Just that stallion.

70
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,190
Once he's gone, the rest
will leave on their own.

71
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,100
Best of luck. That bastard
kicked my truck door so hard,

72
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,770
we had to use a crowbar to get it open.

73
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,200
That damn mustang's done more
in one week to stop drilling

74
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,400
than every environmental
group in the state.

75
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,040
Maybe I should just leave
him where he is then.

76
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,380
Where'd you find this guy?

77
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,410
Yellow pages.

78
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,550
Ad says he works with problem horses.

79
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,100
Oh, this'll be interesting.

80
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,890
Kid's fucking crazy.

81
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,860
Yeah, uh...

82
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,700
sure is building something.

83
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,970
- Beth.
- Of course he didn't.

84
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,940
He couldn't find his
ass with both hands.

85
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,870
- Bob... Bob needs you.
- Give me a minute.

86
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,360
I don't think he has a minute.

87
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,919
God damn it, Bob, I didn't come here

88
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,500
to do business with these people.

89
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,080
I came here to do business with you.

90
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,360
I can hear you screaming
halfway down the hall, Craig.

91
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,490
I thought we were gonna try
and work this out, Bob.

92
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,806
We've been trying to work this out

93
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,540
for three hours, Craig.

94
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,600
This is the alternative.

95
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,100
We don't want to merge.

96
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,970
No one wants to merge with you.

97
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,600
You have a three-to-one debt ratio.

98
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,500
It'd be easier to sell VCRs.

99
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,539
I'm not gonna be bullied by your

100
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,540
hatchet man, Bob.

101
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,710
We will pull our funds,

102
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,920
and we will take our business
down the street to Chase.

103
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,380
We're just asking you to
suspend the dividend.

104
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,680
And kill the stock!

105
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,990
What do you think's gonna happen

106
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,820
when I dump our 18%
share tomorrow morning?

107
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,630
I'll tell you what.

108
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,530
The stock will drop below 10,

109
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,530
SEC will suspend trading,

110
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,540
and every creditor you
have will file on you.

111
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,670
Your company will be
chapter 11 by Friday,

112
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,810
and since we're your largest creditors,

113
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,980
I can promise you there'll
be no negotiating then.

114
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,550
I will be CEO of IL Energy by Monday.

115
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,820
I will fire every fucking employee.

116
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,750
Then I will sell your leases
and equipment to Chevron

117
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,490
for 30¢ on the dollar, and you, buddy,

118
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,690
you will have the unique distinction

119
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,630
of being the only drilling company

120
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,060
to go bankrupt in the largest oil boom

121
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,680
of the last century.

122
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,820
Won't that look good on a resume?

123
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,840
I started this company in my garage.

124
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,199
That's where it's gonna end up

125
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,540
if you don't suspend the dividend

126
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,840
and allow us to assume management.

127
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,020
Don't look at him.

128
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,300
You're dealing with me now.

129
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,200
So what's it gonna be?

130
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,760
Are we restructuring
your company tomorrow

131
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,260
or killing it?

132
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,360
Good.

133
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,170
You made the right choice, Craig.

134
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,670
We'll get you through this.

135
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,450
Bitch.

136
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,080
I just saved your house.

137
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,800
I put your kids through college.

138
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,560
Maybe you should say
something more appropriate.

139
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,030
Thank you.

140
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,740
You're welcome.

141
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,490
_

142
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,420
Daddy!

143
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,610
Hey, buddy.

144
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,780
Bet it was fun putting
him in the trailer.

145
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,720
Yeah, they call him a tornado.

146
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,690
How are you planning on getting him out?

147
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,320
I'm just making this up as I go, babe.

148
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,460
I'd step back a bit
further if I were you.

149
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,330
It's all right.

150
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,570
I know it don't seem like it, but it is.

151
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,540
Easy.

152
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,810
Easy.

153
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,050
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

154
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,280
Easy, easy. That's it.

155
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,400
That's it.

156
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,850
Hey.

157
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,690
Whoa... whoa.

158
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,290
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

159
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,020
You kids get back!

160
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,590
Hey, hey, hey.

161
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,180
That's it, that's it. Come on.

162
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,200
It's all right. It's all right.

163
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,210
Can I pet him?

164
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,840
Sure, son, in about a year.

165
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,850
No fear in this one.
He got that from you.

166
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,120
You mean no common sense.
He got that from you.

167
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,959
Well, I suppose your homework

168
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,680
is in the kitchen doing itself.

169
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,820
Oh, he's gonna be fun to break.

170
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,140
Well, holler at me if you need my help.

171
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,000
Free tomorrow?

172
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,770
Could use a hand.

173
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,770
Yeah, sure.

174
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,560
Bring a horse.

175
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,340
Just not that one.

176
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,320
Wow. My brother actually talked to me.

177
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,400
Well, that was progress.

178
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,540
Yeah, it was something.

179
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,050
I got parent conferences tonight,

180
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,930
so you're on Tate patrol.

181
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,200
All right.

182
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,700
I wonder what he's thinking.

183
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,440
Well, he's probably thinking
I took his freedom.

184
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,340
Well, he's right.

185
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,240
Supper's ready.

186
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,630
Ah, damn it.

187
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,970
Your mother was always better at this.

188
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,140
Hey, you know who's really good at it?

189
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,840
- Doctors.
- Yeah.

190
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,140
Should have done that yesterday.

191
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,040
Here, let me do it. Let me do it.

192
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,400
All right, Alan asked me
to mention it, so I will.

193
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,520
They'd allow us to harvest
the timber before the...

194
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,750
No.

195
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,220
- The answer's no.
- Yeah.

196
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,740
Can I do this?

197
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,530
Yeah.

198
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,760
When you say no, it must be
the death of the question.

199
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,000
Mm-hmm, I understand.

200
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,530
If there's even a hint of maybe,

201
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,010
the questions won't stop until they find

202
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,540
something you can't say no to.

203
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,970
Mm.

204
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,556
You got to learn when to think

205
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,880
like a lawyer, you understand?

206
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,800
And when to think like a landowner.

207
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,180
Or a lawyer's all you're ever gonna be.

208
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,020
Yeah.

209
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,940
Well, I'll say this. You...

210
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,990
You got your mother's hands.

211
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,870
Hey.

212
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,470
I told them no.

213
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,580
Hey, I said you wouldn't consider it.

214
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,220
Should you consider it? Absolutely.

215
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,760
We could use the money and the
leverage that comes with it.

216
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,590
You're not coming, Dad?

217
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,120
No, I got a meeting in Bozeman.

218
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,280
Why don't you take your
badge out with you today?

219
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,430
Take a rifle too.

220
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,540
I mean, they won't give us
any trouble over strays.

221
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,350
I mean, hell, they'll probably
help us round them up.

222
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,640
Well, the badge is for the
ranchers riding with you.

223
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,320
It'll keep them from
bringing home any extras.

224
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,980
Did you hear me?

225
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,940
Leverage is knowing if someone had...

226
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,360
all the money in the world...

227
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,060
This is what they'd buy.

228
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,060
Senator.

229
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,199
I'm sorry I'm late.

230
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,419
I wanted to see the reservation first.

231
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,000
Did you enjoy your tour?

232
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,050
No, no, I did not.

233
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,259
Well, it's good that you took it.

234
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,500
Inequity must be
witnessed to be changed.

235
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,629
Please have a seat.

236
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,840
Oh.

237
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,770
I can't imagine all your mother overcame

238
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,140
just to raise you here.

239
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,639
I never met my mother,

240
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,420
and I wasn't raised here.

241
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,139
Till I was 18, I thought I was Mexican

242
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,180
even though I didn't look Mexican

243
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,960
and I didn't feel Mexican,

244
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,260
if one can feel their heritage,
which I believe one can.

245
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,060
When I turned 18, my adoption
records were unsealed,

246
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,469
and imagine my surprise.

247
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,679
I confronted my adopted parents,

248
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,580
who said they lied to protect me.

249
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,700
They said as a Mexican,

250
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,980
I would face discrimination, sure,

251
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,389
but as an Indian, I would know a hatred

252
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:19,560
that had to be endured
to be fully understood.

253
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,900
They thought they were giving
me a better chance at life.

254
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,979
That's this nation's policy toward us,

255
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,980
always has been.

256
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,559
If we want a better
life, all we have to do

257
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,420
is stop being Indian.

258
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,440
I'm gonna change that policy.

259
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,200
My people are the only ones
that can change that policy.

260
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,459
The gambler's money is like a river,

261
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,660
flowing one way... our way.

262
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,960
Senator, you've never driven a road

263
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,659
or walked a trail or skied
a mountain in Montana

264
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,560
that didn't belong to my people first.

265
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,600
This nation doesn't
want to give it back?

266
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,200
So be it.

267
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,640
We'll buy it back...

268
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,149
with their money.

269
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,900
So what do you want from me?

270
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,420
I want you to help me spend it.

271
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,359
Come.

272
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,360
Meet the people we're saving.

273
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,630
Ladies and gentlemen, let's
welcome the new chairman

274
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,729
of Broken Rock, Thomas Rainwater!

275
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,189
What about water and power?

276
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,720
You don't need a permit for that?

277
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,840
See, the bank's concern is that
you're gonna break ground,

278
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,499
and the state or the fucking
EPA paper us in lawsuits

279
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,400
because we built a power
plant without a permit.

280
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,760
In the state of Montana,
no permit is required

281
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,190
to build a power source
for a mine or a mill.

282
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,510
Now, we'll construct our own mill

283
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,860
that will also allow us to harvest wood

284
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,840
directly from the forest,

285
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,860
cutting our lumber cost by 65%.

286
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,080
Damming the river here
will generate enough power

287
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,850
to light every home in the subdivision.

288
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,390
Now, this is a self-sustaining community

289
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,360
30 miles from the most pristine
wilderness in North America.

290
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,930
Now, if you don't see
the potential in that,

291
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,379
we need another bank.

292
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,780
We see the potential. I just...

293
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,139
There are no restrictions
on damming a river?

294
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,980
Beavers do it all the time.

295
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,480
On our land it's our river.

296
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,780
Now, this isn't California, gentlemen.

297
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,360
This is Montana.

298
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,880
We can do whatever we want.

299
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,179
My name's Ted.

300
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,720
Where are you from?

301
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,420
Really?

302
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,099
I've been here a week. You're
the first person I've met

303
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,080
who's actually from here.

304
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,300
Can I buy you another drink?

305
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,980
Why not?

306
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,080
Hey, Dalton, give me another one.

307
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,500
You don't live here anymore,
though, not dressed like that.

308
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,160
You came back for a family reunion.

309
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,020
No, no, those never happen
at home for some reason.

310
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,600
Let's see, Bozeman is a college town,

311
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,620
so I'm gonna say a school reunion,

312
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,600
class of... 2006.

313
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,300
Am I close?

314
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,720
Do you feel close, Ted?

315
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,780
Ah, it feels like I'm getting close.

316
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,970
My turn.

317
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,309
You're in real estate or something

318
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,389
equally as unimportant, married,

319
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,889
couple of kids, one on the way.

320
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:13,240
That was your excuse to come out here.

321
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,799
Need the break. Work, family life.

322
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,219
It's so demanding.

323
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,880
A little fresh air, a little "me time."

324
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,659
You came alone 'cause none of
your friends could afford it,

325
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,389
and those who do, they...
they have wives

326
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:26,599
a lot smarter than yours
'cause let's be honest, Ted,

327
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,880
you didn't come here to fish.

328
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,389
You're hunting.

329
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,859
That's why you're sitting in a bar

330
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,360
instead of standing in a river.

331
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,969
Who the hell are you to judge me?

332
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,560
I ain't judging you, buddy.

333
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,000
Morning, gentlemen.

334
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,139
I'm hunting too,

335
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,340
just not hunting you.

336
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,020
What's wrong with me?

337
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,320
You look like a real soft fuck, Ted.

338
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,760
All you city boys do.

339
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,240
Gentlemen, mind if I join you?

340
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,020
They even got the barb wire tore down.

341
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,310
That is our property, god damn it.

342
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,639
Can't hear ya.

343
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,500
Come about 2 feet closer.

344
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,139
- You think I won't?
- I think you shouldn't,

345
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,820
but coming on our land
is bred into you people.

346
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,960
I've had enough of your shit.

347
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,880
Let me tell you something...

348
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:25,530
When those cattle walked onto our land,

349
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,060
they became our cattle
to do as we please.

350
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:31,120
Whatever happens next
happens to you first.

351
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,120
Son of a bitch.

352
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,260
Back up.

353
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:45,000
You should respect your veterans.

354
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,389
Boy, you sure made a mess of this.

355
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,500
It was a mess when I got here.

356
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,700
This is a tribal issue, John.

357
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,760
Livestock commission's
got no authority here.

358
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,060
Those look like livestock to me.

359
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,979
The Chief's at Commencement,

360
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,980
but I'm calling the shots.

361
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,850
I'm impressed you said that
with a straight face, Ben.

362
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,780
Cattle wandered onto res land, John.

363
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,179
Yeah, well,

364
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,389
cattle don't know the difference

365
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,840
between your land and ours.

366
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:38,140
Neither did we till the
government showed us. Ha.

367
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,860
Now I guess we're showing you.

368
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,780
I argued against it,
but the new chief...

369
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,840
Hungry for a fight, this one.

370
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,460
God damn it, I just...

371
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,760
I just don't see how anyone
gains from all this, Felix.

372
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,100
I don't either, but he
don't think like me.

373
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,040
Grew up in Denver,

374
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,460
went to some big university.

375
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,560
Now he thinks like you.

376
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:20,360
I'll keep 'em here as
long as I can, John.

377
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,100
I'll bring up hay so they don't wander.

378
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:29,939
Lee!

379
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,460
I got to go.

380
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,420
Clear everyone out.

381
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,780
You know, there was barbed
wire on this fence a week ago.

382
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,560
I know. Now clear them out.

383
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,799
Move out!

384
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,280
All right, let's go!

385
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,390

386
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:56,599

00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:02,180

390
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,500
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd
like to welcome you out

391
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,889
to the 2018

392
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:27,060
Greater Montana Livestock Auction.

393
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,800
We're gonna start out
with lot number one.

394
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,720
It's Royal M. Duke, a 2013 registered

395
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,580
English bull offered by
Double G Angus Ranch,

396
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,479
sired by Supreme Domino
out of Miss Domino.

397
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,860
Now we're gonna start the
bidding out at 25,000.

398
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,809
I'm at 25. I'm at 50.

399
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,389
I'm at 55, gonna go 60, at 60 now,

400
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:48,599
now 5 on 65,000, 65 looking for 70.

401
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,179
75, 75

402
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,260
and now bid at 80, 80,000, 85?

403
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,270
85, now 90, 90?

404
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,500
One phone call. I'll be right back.

405
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,780
We have any little recourse
on the Reservation land?

406
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,299
Civil maybe, but if you're
talking prosecution,

407
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,320
we need friends in the U.S.
Attorney's Office.

408
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,560
Make some.

409
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,500
Hello, Trent.

410
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,200
John.

411
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,840
I wouldn't wish the week you're
having on my mother-in-law.

412
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,900
Well, it's only Tuesday.

413
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,199
50, 60, 60.

414
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,280
Now 70. 70 now.

415
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,280
75, now bid at 80, 80.

416
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,760
John.

417
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,679
This is not the day, Dirk.

418
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,300
The word has it you're hiring.

419
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,200
Cowboys, not criminals.

420
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,760
I can't stop him.

421
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,400
You can.

422
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:45,200
Jimmy's the only family I have left.

423
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:48,220
The favor's to me, not to him.

424
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,860
Please.

425
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,380
Please.

426
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,440
All right.

427
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,019
We're gonna do this my way, all right?

428
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,139
- You understand? My way.
- Yeah.

429
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,469
I remember when your
way was the only way,

430
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:07,260
and the world was better for that.

431
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,440
- Hello, Governor.
- John.

432
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,180
How are you?

433
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,000
Thank you.

434
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,969
Jamie did well at the hearing.

435
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:18,560
It's easy to do well when
the outcome's decided.

436
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,389
I couldn't hit it if
he didn't tee it up,

437
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,420
and my offer still stands, John.

438
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,269
Yeah, well...

439
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,420
I don't want him in politics.

440
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,320
He's already in politics.

441
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:31,240
Yeah, with a constituency of one.

442
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,440
How concerned should I be
about this issue on the Res?

443
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:41,720
It's a new chief showing
off for his voters.

444
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,480
We've all done it.

445
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:49,599
Well...

446
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,400
we should schedule a lunch.

447
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,220
I could use a lunch.

448
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,429
Sold it to you. 135. Sold it, 135.

449
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,360
You were right.

450
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,160
- _
- They're building a city.

451
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,070
Goodnight, Daddy.

452
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,500
Goodnight, sweetheart.

453
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,220
Good to have you home.

454
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,620
That's it.

455
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,280
Come on. That's it.

456
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,420
That's it.

457
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,940
That's it, buddy.

458
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,680
Got tiger stripes on his legs.

459
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,539
You know what that means, don't you?

460
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,180
Spanish blood.

461
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,620
Pure.

462
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,020
One of his ancestors probably
bucked a conquistador

463
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,320
and took to the hills.

464
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,730
You manage to break his spirit,

465
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,490
no horse will serve you better.

466
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,160
He'll serve me just fine
with spirit intact.

467
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:00,970
Yeah.

468
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,760
I used to think the
same thing at your age.

469
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,740
Hope you prove me wrong.

470
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,820
I didn't know them were your cattle.

471
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,700
Would it have made a difference?

472
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,240
You don't want to be on the
wrong side of this, son.

473
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,860
Yeah, well, the list of things
I don't want is endless.

474
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,080
You telling me what
to do is one of them.

475
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,340
I'm not telling you what to do.

476
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,320
I just don't want you to get in trouble.

477
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,619
Well, if I'd have known there was sides,

478
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,000
I wouldn't have been there at all.

479
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,939
Good lord,

480
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,580
even here the world
just keeps on coming.

481
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,240
Rough week, huh?

482
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,340
Yeah.

483
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,259
One only a grandson could fix.

484
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,900
Thought I'd come see

485
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,740
Tate play in the dirt,
maybe even join him.

486
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,180
He's at Monica's parents.

487
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,780
I guess the early grandpa
gets the worm, huh?

488
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,040
Can I give you some advice, Kayce?

489
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,620
Someday your son's gonna test you.

490
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,830
He's gonna force you to make a decision

491
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,499
that not only determines his future

492
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,760
but your place in it.

493
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,699
I want you to remember
me standing here, son,

494
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,060
before you make that
decision, because this...

495
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,220
this is a consequence of choosing wrong.

496
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,960
Anything else?

497
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,900
I just want to know him, Kayce.

498
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,600
- You know him.
- No, I don't.

499
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,549
I don't. We've met, but
I don't really know him.

500
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,960
And he doesn't know me.

501
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,929
Is it too much to ask that
you help make that happen?

502
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,240
You've always asked too much.

503
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,260
What was he doing here?

504
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,240
Who knows?

505
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,380
Dad!

506
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,520
Is this for me?

507
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,280
You Jimmy?

508
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,300
Dirk Hurdstram's boy?

509
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,360
You alone, Jimmy?

510
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,090
I'll take that as a yes.

511
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,180
You're a two-time loser, Jimmy.

512
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,720
One more felony, and they
throw away the keys.

513
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,280
You know what? You might
do all right in prison.

514
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,220
You got the lips for it.

515
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,670
You're either a servant
or a king in this place,

516
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,680
and I ain't no fucking servant.

517
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,900
No, no.

518
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,960
You're a thief.

519
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,620
Oh, what the fuck, man?

520
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,670
What the fuck, man?

521
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,680
Wait, wait, wait!

522
00:35:03,681 --> 00:35:06,319
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait!

523
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,799
Fucking psycho, wait!

524
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,180
Jimmy, I'm gonna give you two choices.

525
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,080
One is I take you and all this shit,

526
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,920
and I drive you down to
the sheriff's office,

527
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,220
and it's good riddance
to your sorry ass,

528
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,360
or you prove that you
deserve another chance.

529
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,459
From what I can see, you don't,

530
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,220
but it ain't up to me.

531
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:26,760
You're with the Yellowstone?

532
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,640
It's getting cold, Jimmy.

533
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,379
You know what? Fuck it. I'm
taking you to the sheriff's.

534
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,780
- Wait, just...
- Just get up.

535
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,900
Why would John Dutton
give a shit about me?

536
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,840
He doesn't.

537
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,060
But he will.

538
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,799
Now, you be a man about it.

539
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,660
Don't scream.

540
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,040
You know where the ranch is?

541
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,700
You start Monday.

542
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,940
Hey, we need a new dishwasher.

543
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,460
I notice you never ask for
appliances with your pants on.

544
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,879
Number one, I make more money

545
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,469
- than you do, cowboy.
- Oh, yeah?

546
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,549
And number two, I already bought it.

547
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,250
No pants is so you don't bitch

548
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,120
about driving to Billings to pick it up.

549
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,140
Ugh, Billings.

550
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,420
It's so far.

551
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,480
Tell me about today.

552
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,180
He just wants to know his grandson.

553
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,320
I guess we could give him that.
What do you think?

554
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,820
You know what I think.

555
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,280
But we'll give it to him anyway.

556
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,520
It'll happen to us too someday.

557
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,660
Tate'll move away and
have a family of his own,

558
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,720
and all we'll get is little fixes.

559
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,300
That is the meanest thing
you've ever said to me.

560
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,760
I know, baby, but it's true.

561
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,700
We can make another.

562
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,860
That way when he leaves,
it won't hurt so bad.

563
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,690
Hold on.

564
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,310
1138.

565
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,180
1138.

566
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,289
Lost one last year.

567
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:26,200
Old gal just turned 11.

568
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:28,940
Get rid of her.

569
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,949
I needed you at the auction.

570
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,620
I was at the auction.

571
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,440
I don't mean checking brands.

572
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,160
Dad, I stand in bullshit 12 hours a day.

573
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,799
I'm not gonna do it at night.
That's Jamie's job.

574
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,020
You can't run this place

575
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,679
if you won't interact
with the people, Lee.

576
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,909
- I'm running it right now.
- This ain't running it.

577
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,280
- Don't start with me.
- This ain't running it!

578
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:53,830
This is working it.

579
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:56,880
God damn it, 38 years old,

580
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,820
you still don't know the difference.

581
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,000
Shit, one's down.

582
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,159
Looks like a breech.

583
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,619
Can we get her up?

584
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,440
No, we'll pull it...

585
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,740
We'll pull it while she's down.

586
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:52,290
You got her?

587
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,680
Okay, ready?

588
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,540
I'm sorry.

589
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,199
You feel the legs?

590
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,380
Not yet.

591
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:06,240
Easy, mama. Easy, easy.

592
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,859
Okay, got them, I got them.

593
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,860
All right, tell me when.

594
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,240
Tell me when.

595
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,909
All right, go.

596
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:18,659
Shh, easy, mama.

597
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,699
Shh.

598
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,500
Whew.

599
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,800
When you look at that
calf, what do you see?

600
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,830
I see a life I got to feed and defend

601
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,460
until it grows up and feeds me.

602
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,040
That's what a cowboy should see.

603
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:22,199
But a cattleman sees a $293 investment

604
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,500
worth $1,100 in seven months

605
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:28,520
whether it feeds anyone or not.

606
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:31,960
Wish I saw it different, Dad.

607
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,940
Well, we see it the way we see it, son.

608
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,200
Well, if it isn't bachelor number two

609
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,399
up at the crack of 9:30

610
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,060
and dressed to seize the day.

611
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,289
Yeah.

612
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:16,660
It's Saturday.

613
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,900
No weekends on a ranch.

614
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,100
You know that.

615
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,160
Nice to see you're still smoking.

616
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,219
Well, women in this family

617
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,930
don't live much past 40 anyway,

618
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,990
so I might as well enjoy my time.

619
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,300
What are you doing here?

620
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:37,460
Same thing I always do.

621
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,680
Fixing something you couldn't.

622
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,580
You missed breakfast.

623
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,980
Now, what the hell are we
supposed to do with buffalo?

624
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:00,760
You'll see.

625
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,829
Yeah, well how much
these sumbitches cost?

626
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:05,580
Well, they ain't cheap.

627
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:37,950
I was thinking about you yesterday.

628
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,230
A friend of mine in Jackson Hole

629
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,699
was talking about their rodeo.

630
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,949
Bozeman doesn't have one. Why not?

631
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:46,659
It's 'cause nobody here
cares about rodeos.

632
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,800
Oh, you're wrong, John.

633
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,940
Every millionaire I know
wants to be a cowboy.

634
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:54,360
Authenticity's the one thing
that money can't buy.

635
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,080
It'd be good for Bozeman

636
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,040
and a great way to honor men like you.

637
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:00,950
Yeah, well, parading us
in front of your friends,

638
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,699
Dan, isn't an honor. It's a...

639
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,080
it's an insult.

640
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,560
You want to build subdivisions,

641
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,500
move to Dallas. I won't have them here.

642
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:13,199
Yeah, that's right. Nothing
happens in this valley

643
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,760
I don't know about.

644
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,449
It's called progress, John,

645
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:19,400
and progress doesn't
need your permission.

646
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,340
Yeah, in this valley it does.

647
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,960
What do you care what I build?

648
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,829
You expect me to believe
that you're concerned

649
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,120
about the environment?

650
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,940
You raise cattle, you fucking hypocrite.

651
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,140
You know what I think it is?

652
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,579
I think it's ego.

653
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,180
I think it chaps your ass

654
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,980
to walk through a grocery store
and nobody knows who you are.

655
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,550
You bet your ass it does

656
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,659
because every family you move in

657
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:43,320
moves a family I know out.

658
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,960
With every winner, there's a loser.

659
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,040
First thing you said I agree with.

660
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:49,100
Can't stop it, John.

661
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,000
Watch me.

662
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,579
Go ahead, say it.

663
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,909
It'll make a lawsuit much simpler.

664
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,340
Say, "Stop building or else."

665
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:00,659
I'm skipping straight to "or else"

666
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,539
with you, you cocksucker,

667
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:06,380
and from now on "or
else" is all you get.

668
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,280
And by the way...

669
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,900
you owe me a horse, you son of a bitch.

670
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:33,180
He's not there.

671
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:41,260
You look nervous, Rip.

672
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:44,799
Like a stray dog who can't
enjoy being in the house

673
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,450
'cause he's so worried about the broom.

674
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,540
You're up early.

675
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:53,940
I don't really sleep.

676
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:57,280
Yeah, well, they say
spiders don't, so...

677
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:58,420
Oh.

678
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:08,500
What are you doing?

679
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,000
Adjusting my web.

680
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,330
You know, life's not
that complicated, Rip.

681
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,780
You either walk on down the hall...

682
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,100
Or fuck me.

683
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,409
There's a music festival

684
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:01,490
in Livingston this weekend.

685
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,980
You want to go with me?

686
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,360
You ruin it every time.

687
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,300
That's funny.

688
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:20,320
I always remember your
dick as being bigger.

689
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,160
I guess that's just the nostalgic in me.

690
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,460
Is this where you ate ice
cream when you were a boy?

691
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,600
This wasn't here when I was a boy.

692
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:52,030
None of this was.

693
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,720
I will say this though.

694
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:58,710
These transplants sure
can make some ice cream.

695
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,120
What's a transplant?

696
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:05,580
It's, um,

697
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,520
a person who moves to a place,

698
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,639
and then they try to make that place

699
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,460
just like the place they left.

700
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,240
That don't make sense.

701
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:16,390
Not one bit.

702
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:24,730
It's all right. Here. Give me that.

703
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,160
Hold that in both hands
and eat it from the top

704
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:28,480
so it don't fall off again.

705
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,970
Is he a transplant?

706
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,670
They're all transplants.

707
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,390
What's the matter, Dad?

708
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,330
Nothing, buddy.

709
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,570
Just hope I don't regret this.

710
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:44,080
_

711
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:14,140
Thought I'd bring the fix to you.

712
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,320
You know how to ride a horse?

713
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:26,820
Course I do. I'm Indian.

714
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,130
Yeah, maybe so.

715
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:34,300
But you're a cowboy today.

716
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,930
Thank you for this.

717
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:42,910
Well, shit, Kayce,

718
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:44,620
I've dated women with
shorter hair than you.

719
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,886
Yeah, you sure they were women, Lee?

720
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:46,940
I know.

721
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,520
Hey, cowboy.

722
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,090
Last time I saw you,
that was high and tight.

723
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,960
How's Mr. Daniel?

724
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,800
Good for you.

725
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:13,716
Yeah, you're the only one
who shares that opinion.

726
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,740
That's 'cause I'm the only
one who got to know him.

727
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:18,840
What are you doing here?

728
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:22,610
Closure, I guess. You?

729
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,280
Penance.

730
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:25,880
Not sure you'll find that here.

731
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:28,680
Penance you earn. Closure you find.

732
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,520
Look somewhere else, and you might.

733
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,560
Hey, Kayce, let's go.

734
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:37,620
Grab a horse.

735
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:40,230
Any chance you'd join us?

736
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,930
I don't get near those fucking things.

737
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,910
Yah! Move it!

738
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:07,590
Let me do it, Grandpa.

739
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:08,990
- Can you do it?
- Yeah.

740
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:10,730
Hi-yah!

741
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:14,100
This horse ain't got any go.

742
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,820
He's got some go. Hold on.

743
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:18,500
I'll get him going for you.

744
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:19,870
- Race you.
- Yah!

745
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,440
Yah!

746
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:29,180
- Yah!
- Whoo!

747
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,050
Think they should hold here.

748
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,130
Kayce might be the only
man who can outride him.

749
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,870
Just might be.

750
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,540
Fish on.

751
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,200
Tate.

752
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,330
All right, buddy.

753
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,730
Here, grab... grab that rod.

754
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,270
Reel him in.

755
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:29,140
There you go. Reel it in, buddy.

756
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:33,940
Whoo!

757
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:37,080
Lee, get my horse. Whoo!

758
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:39,320
Little late in the year for that.

759
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:43,800
Got him.

760
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:46,820
I caught a fish!

761
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,659
Can you pull him up?

762
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,260
Look at that.

763
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:51,540
Whoo!

764
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,730
That's a big one, huh?

765
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,500
- Yeah.
- Oh, she's pretty.

766
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,200
- Yeah.
- Look at that one.

767
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,510
Any luck?

768
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,730
Here, wait, don't touch it.

769
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:24,090
It's kind of hot.

770
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:26,630
Careful.

771
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,630
You're gonna raise him on a reservation?

772
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,730
People do it every day.

773
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,400
'Cause they have no choice, Kayce.

774
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:36,710
Yeah, looks like you're ready to eat.

775
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:39,910
It's a good day.

776
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,680
Every day, just like this.

777
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:45,450
Who are you kidding?

778
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:48,350
Bet you haven't fished here in years.

779
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:51,320
Only thing we haven't done
in years is see you, Kayce.

780
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:53,590
Well, he told me to leave.

781
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:56,059
He told us all to leave.

782
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:58,130
You were just the only one who did.

783
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:03,330
It's different. You know that.

784
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,800
Right, so you're gonna raise
him in that meth-filled

785
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,140
desert to prove a point.

786
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,970
What I'm proving you'll
never understand.

787
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,480
Shit, I miss being young.

788
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:17,079
You wake up in the morning,

789
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,150
and you just keep right
on dreaming, huh?

790
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:23,440
You're a 38-year-old bachelor
living in your father's house,

791
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:26,699
working 100-hour weeks for
a nibble of his approval.

792
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,120
Is that the dream, Lee?

793
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,790
Sure as shit ain't mine.

794
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,800
Hey.

795
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:40,940
Hey!

796
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,170
Don't throw things at my dad.

797
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,250
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Whoa!

798
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:45,580
- Oh.
- Fucker.

799
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:46,940
- Tate!
- Whoa!

800
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:52,180
It's okay, buddy.

801
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:55,610
We're just brothers arguing, man.

802
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,090
Nobody's mad, okay?

803
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:58,750
It's all right.

804
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:03,060
You gonna tell me there's
no fight in that blood?

805
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:06,100
He's right though.

806
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,600
It is a good day.

807
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,420
He said "fucker."

808
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,710
You got green for water.

809
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:23,630
Blue is sewage, yellow for gas.

810
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,630
Driveways are marked in pink

811
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:28,030
and corner buildings in red.

812
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,570
If I were to dam the river...

813
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:34,060
I'd do it right there around the bend.

814
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,220
That's where they're doing it.

815
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:39,980
That's your property upstream?

816
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:44,720
Now, I'm not gonna lie to you.

817
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:46,880
There's gonna be a severe
impact to your land.

818
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,560
Erosion's my biggest concern.

819
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,430
My biggest concern is a subdivision

820
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:56,000
sucking on our river.

821
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:58,100
There's nothing you can do.

822
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,320
On their land, it's their river.

823
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:03,240
I mean, I can't stop the
river from flowing.

824
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:14,610
I don't want you to stop it, Ron.

825
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,420
I want you to move it.

826
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:24,640
_

827
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:29,660
How's it going over there?

828
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:31,176
Oh, hey, we got to make the dressing.

829
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,360
Oh, okay, I'll make it.

830
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,100
How could you give him a D, Monica?

831
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:39,510
He's your nephew.

832
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:41,700
The D was a gift, believe me.

833
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:43,860
What can I say?

834
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,450
Math is not his thing, like his father.

835
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:47,826
Well, he better make it his thing,

836
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:49,480
or he's gonna end up like his father.

837
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,690
He's my brother. I can say it.

838
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:56,390
When I get my steers,
I'm gonna take one,

839
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:59,160
carve out a porterhouse
the size of a radiator.

840
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:02,860
They divvying up the cattle?

841
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:07,470
You don't like it,

842
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:09,570
maybe you shouldn't
have rounded them up.

843
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:13,520
They ain't yours to divvy.

844
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:20,050
What is that one?

845
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,720
It's a Silver Star.

846
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:26,450
You got one of those?

847
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,000
What do you have to do to win one?

848
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:34,690
You got to kill someone
to get one of those.

849
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,240
Ain't that right, Kayce?

850
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:39,560
What about that one?

851
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:44,470
That's the Navy Cross.

852
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:48,640
You wouldn't believe what I
had to do to get that one.

853
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:57,180
What's he doing here?

854
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:03,860
Well, I hope I'm not intruding.

855
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,359
Of course not, but my
grandfather's not here.

856
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,190
Well, I'm not here to
see your grandfather.

857
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,570
I want to thank you for
helping the other day.

858
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:16,169
I don't know your father.

859
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:19,370
I hope it didn't put you in
an uncomfortable position.

860
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:22,599
Well, if you plan on keeping his cattle,

861
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,580
you'll get to know him real well.

862
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:29,460
Those are bargaining
chips, a means to an end.

863
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:32,059
Politicians are like crabs.

864
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:34,060
We move sideways to go forward.

865
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,390
Well, that won't get
you too far with him.

866
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:38,980
An honest man?

867
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,670
He says he'll do something,
you're not gonna stop him,

868
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:43,320
if you call that honest.

869
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:45,760
I do.

870
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,770
It's a rare thing these days.

871
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:51,470
What do you want from me?

872
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:53,120
To help me

873
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:57,940
understand the man I'm negotiating with.

874
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:03,580
Well, he's reasonable
till he's provoked.

875
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,250
Then reason don't factor in at all.

876
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:12,990
Doubt that helps you,
but that's who he is.

877
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:14,930
It helps.

878
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,730
Thank you for your time.

879
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,630
Have a good evening.

880
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:34,220
You're not joining him?

881
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:36,800
You didn't ask me here to hunt.

882
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:39,240
I'm here to talk cattle.

883
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:41,800
They don't belong to you.

884
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:44,579
They don't belong to you either.

885
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:46,330
They belong to the people now.

886
01:00:46,530 --> 01:00:48,820
Every one of them wears a brand.

887
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,529
If anybody tries to move
them off the Res...

888
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:52,239
They'll never leave the Res.

889
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:55,760
We'll use them to raise
calves, wear our brand.

890
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:58,619
I understand your position, Thomas,

891
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:00,609
and what you think you need to do...

892
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:02,529
but I won't allow you to make

893
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:03,939
victims of the people who elected me

894
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:06,260
just to appease the
people who elected you.

895
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:10,610
Your people don't know
the concept of victim.

896
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,200
Let's keep this about cattle.

897
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:17,960
If you act like a thief, Thomas,

898
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:20,220
I will treat you like one.

899
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:22,200
How can you stand there on a ranch

900
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,029
the size of Rhode Island

901
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:25,580
and accuse me of theft?

902
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,570
Is this your idea of respect?

903
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:31,840
Letting some crippled old
man ride his lame horse

904
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:34,360
out toward your half-tame buffalo

905
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,716
so he can pretend to be something

906
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:38,580
we haven't been in a century?

907
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:46,880
Whoo!

908
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:50,100
Look what you've reduced us to.

909
01:01:59,330 --> 01:02:01,039
Here's another one.

910
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:06,300
You lay everywhere but the coop.

911
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:28,820
Backstraps.

912
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,580
- Staying for dinner?
- Can't.

913
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:33,260
Just need a few words with
this young buck here.

914
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:35,120
Can you give us a minute?

915
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,880
If you can say it to him,
you can say it to me.

916
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:41,720
Hard to talk about you when
you're standing here, darling.

917
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,260
Come on, Tate. We're
being sent to our room.

918
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:49,860
The Nation will keep the cattle.

919
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:53,060
Your father will try to take them back.

920
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:55,450
He has every right.

921
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:58,459
We had every right to take them,

922
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:00,960
so now we will fight.

923
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:05,119
It's his fight, not mine.

924
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,079
You will be judged

925
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,080
for the actions of your father.

926
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:13,440
If you do nothing, you will
be judged for that too.

927
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,450
They all will.

928
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:18,880
Maybe it's best you go
home for a while, eh?

929
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,539
This is my home.

930
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:23,940
You know what I mean.

931
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:28,880
I've been nothing but a
friend to everybody here.

932
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,390
If somebody wants me to leave,

933
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,909
you can tell them to come make me.

934
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:36,480
Pretty silly thing to
say on a reservation.

935
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:39,460
I don't ask much,

936
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:42,120
but I'm asking you this.

937
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,360
Go home.

938
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:47,260
Take care of my granddaughter.

939
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:50,360
Be good to that boy.

940
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:54,400
Until they find a cure for human nature,

941
01:03:55,330 --> 01:03:58,260
a man must stand with his people.

942
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:04,800
And we are not your people.

943
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:23,620
Hey. Hey, Jimmy!

944
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,330
Let's go. You're late.

945
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,660
Let's go. You're late.

946
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:30,579
You know how to ride a horse?

947
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:31,879
Uh...

948
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:33,739
Figures. Come here. Give me your shit.

949
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:35,879
Let's go. That there is Ron.

950
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,900
You do whatever the
hell he asks you to do.

951
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:41,120
Come on, get on. Get on the horse.

952
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:42,800
I don't...

953
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:45,700
Get on the horse, Jimmy.

954
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:50,679
Pull the reins to stop.

955
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,680
Kick him in the belly to go.

956
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:53,940
All right, let's move.

957
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:04,080
Both in one night?

958
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,320
Everyone's forgotten
who runs this valley.

959
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:11,600
So this is how you remind them?

960
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:14,489
This is not the way to
remind them. It's a...

961
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:16,040
It's a bad idea.

962
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,240
We don't choose the way, little brother.

963
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:01,909
Dad, I'm the fastest runner.

964
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:04,740
I'm bucking. I'm bucking.

965
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:07,580
And he falls.

966
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,890
This is the last one.

967
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:11,180
Jimmy, hey, get your ass up here.

968
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:14,740
- I just saw a trout.
- Shut the fuck up.

969
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:16,860
Crank this thing until
I tell you to stop.

970
01:08:27,930 --> 01:08:29,430
Holy shit, is this legal?

971
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,429
You're a criminal. What do you care?

972
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:32,439
I thought the oldest Dutton was gonna

973
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:33,620
keep me out of trouble.

974
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,559
Getting in trouble's the
only skill you got.

975
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:36,680
The only difference now is

976
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:38,120
you ain't gonna get caught.

977
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,720
Start moving it down
to the river. Let's go.

978
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,220
That's good enough.

979
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,940
Start moving it this way now.

980
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,460
Hey, quit looking at fish.

981
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:19,060
_

982
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:32,390
- Hi, Marian, how are you?
- Hi, how are you?

983
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:36,640
- Hello.
- Hello.

984
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:44,180
- Sir?
- Thank you.

985
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:51,460
- How are we all doing here?
- Oh, good!

986
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:53,120
- It's been a long time.
- Yes.

987
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:55,320
- Thank you for coming by.
- You look well.

988
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,780
Thank you for joining me.

989
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,080
Bye.

990
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:24,220
I feel different here.

991
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:27,360
My skin tingles.

992
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,020
Never felt like this before.

993
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,700
That's because you live in the city.

994
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:37,620
Cities are the sunsets
of civilization...

995
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:40,940
monuments to an exhausted landscape.

996
01:10:44,890 --> 01:10:47,680
Man is migratory by nature.

997
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:52,000
What you're feeling is instinct...

998
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:55,439
a hunger for new land

999
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,980
that's woven into your DNA.

1000
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,840
That's the reason our species survived

1001
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,260
when countless others failed.

1002
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:08,400
That tingle

1003
01:11:08,550 --> 01:11:12,220
is the sensation of
touching your destiny.

1004
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:29,280
The fuck was that?

1005
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,040
Oh, no.

1006
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:49,180
- We hold here.
- Hold up here.

1007
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:50,410
They're coming.

1008
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,210
We're in position.

1009
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:03,520
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1010
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:05,120
Hold on.

1011
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,800
Get ready.

1012
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,430
They're coming.

1013
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,440
Let 'em.

1014
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,060
Let's get out of here!

1015
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:43,160
Robert, let's go!

1016
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:51,600
Lee, get in there.

1017
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:54,570
Yah, yah!

1018
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,420
Who's that? Is that one of ours?

1019
01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:03,580
- Yah! Yah!
- Hit him with the light.

1020
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:09,020
- Yah! Yah, yah!
- What the hell's he doing?

1021
01:13:11,390 --> 01:13:12,960
God damn that boy.

1022
01:13:13,030 --> 01:13:14,640
Get behind him.

1023
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:17,760
Now take us down.

1024
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:25,860
You see that?

1025
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:28,040
Jesus Christ!

1026
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,180
No. Hold your fire.

1027
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:39,940
What do we do now?

1028
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:42,040
Pull back.

1029
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:44,960
Pull back. Abort.

1030
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:48,390
Everybody pull back.

1031
01:13:56,370 --> 01:13:57,970
Put your gun down!

1032
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:03,580
We got to get the fuck out of here.

1033
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,380
We ain't going anywhere
without our beef.

1034
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:07,120
Hold them back!

1035
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:11,120
Get over in front of them!
Hold them back!

1036
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:14,750
Yah! Yah!

1037
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:16,960
Yah!

1038
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:27,000
40 tours in Afghanistan,
and I got to deal

1039
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:28,900
with this shit in fucking Montana.

1040
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:31,000
- Wheel us around.
- Jesus Christ, John,

1041
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:32,950
- we got to get out of here.
- I said wheel us around!

1042
01:14:32,970 --> 01:14:34,910
We've still got men down there.

1043
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:37,040
Drop us down and push
those bastards back.

1044
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:38,180
Yes, sir.

1045
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:42,519
Closer.

1046
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,520
Hang on.

1047
01:14:59,430 --> 01:15:00,680
All right, we're through.

1048
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:13,910
Keep them moving.

1049
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:24,500
You want 'em back, come and get 'em!

1050
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:33,700
Oh!

1051
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:51,580
I want them back.

1052
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:03,880
Hang on, okay?

1053
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:05,530
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1054
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:09,940
Look at you... you're a man now.

1055
01:16:27,090 --> 01:16:29,000
In case you don't already know,

1056
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,160
there's no such thing as heaven.

1057
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:41,600
Hey.

1058
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:24,219
Yes, sir, yeah. I hear you.

1059
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:25,280
Give me four mounted agents

1060
01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:27,379
and four agents on ATVs
out there right now.

1061
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:28,410
Yes.

1062
01:17:29,950 --> 01:17:31,460
I hear... okay.

1063
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,600
Okay, thank you.

1064
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:35,650
Thank you.

1065
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:38,919
All right, state police are sending

1066
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,530
a chopper out to look for him.

1067
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:48,100
Tell them to hold off.

1068
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:49,500
I found him.

1069
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:18,980
Give me the reins.

1070
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:21,140
Give me the reins.

1071
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:23,070
All right.

1072
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:25,540
Go straight to Jamie.

1073
01:18:25,550 --> 01:18:27,840
Tell him everything while
it's fresh, all right?

1074
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:04,640
What happened?

1075
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:31,600
We'll just...

1076
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,599
We'll just...

1077
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,600
we'll just rest here a bit.

1078
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:41,780
Then we can...

1079
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:47,650
We can pick a spot together, huh?

1080
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:51,560
How's that sound?

1081
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:30,940
Okay.

1082
01:20:58,890 --> 01:21:00,330
Mama?

1083
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,660
Go back to your room.

1084
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:04,530
Now.

1085
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:57,560
Fuck.

1086
01:22:58,280 --> 01:22:59,879
A dispute over cattle

1087
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:02,330
between tribal police, BLM officers,

1088
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:04,850
and members of Montana's
livestock association

1089
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:06,199
turned deadly last night...

1090
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:07,649
- Turn it down.
- Leaving three men dead.

1091
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:09,060
The FBI...

1092
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:13,620
What did Kayce tell you?

1093
01:23:14,150 --> 01:23:16,760
The usual, nothing.

1094
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,640
I should have seen this coming.

1095
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,860
How could you know he
wanted the cattle that bad?

1096
01:23:24,150 --> 01:23:26,020
He didn't want the cattle.

1097
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:29,400
He wanted this.

1098
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:32,339
The FBI and Bureau of
Indian Affairs agents

1099
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:34,930
are investigating two of
the deaths as murders,

1100
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:36,640
and though jurisdictional issues

1101
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:39,080
will certainly complicate
the investigation,

1102
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:40,920
the U.S. Attorney's Office is pledging

1103
01:23:40,970 --> 01:23:42,820
every available resource.

1104
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:47,009
I'll have a senate hearing
on this next month.

1105
01:23:47,010 --> 01:23:49,700
You have the full weight
of my office behind you.

1106
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:52,660
Thank you, Senator. We're gonna need it.

1107
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:13,609
Dad.

1108
01:24:13,610 --> 01:24:14,860
It's time.

1109
01:24:22,820 --> 01:24:23,980
Boys.

1110
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:11,400
Let us pray.

1111
01:25:14,570 --> 01:25:16,520
"Men and brethren,

1112
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:19,960
let me freely speak unto
you of the patriarch David,

1113
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:22,649
that he is both dead and buried... "

1114
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,900
Amen.

1115
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:27,899
He's one hell of a horse.

1116
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:30,820
Yeah.

1117
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:36,660
Ain't got the breeding of your
stud, but he has a heart.

1118
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:39,220
I know. I saw.

1119
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,780
He would have died for me.

1120
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:47,600
He almost did.

1121
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:52,040
You want to stay for supper?

1122
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:56,920
You can put him in the barn.

1123
01:27:56,940 --> 01:27:58,160
No.

1124
01:27:59,260 --> 01:28:01,280
I brought him for you.

1125
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:03,340
You can put him in the barn.

1126
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:43,780
I deserve to know what happened, Kayce.

1127
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,240
He was my brother.

1128
01:29:57,650 --> 01:29:59,240
What happened?

1129
01:30:02,620 --> 01:30:04,500
Baby, why won't you talk to me?

1130
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:50,140
He's never looked at me
the way he looked at Lee.

1131
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:55,740
And he never will.

1132
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:10,180
I need you more than ever.

1133
01:31:11,610 --> 01:31:13,040
You have me.

1134
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:17,600
Can you stay for a while?

1135
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:19,879
I'm not going anywhere.

1136
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:21,600
Just tell me who to fight.

1137
01:31:25,030 --> 01:31:26,400
Everyone.

2
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,912
You got the crescent wrench?

3
00:01:53,912 --> 00:01:56,915
Fucking thing, nobody
ever puts it back-

4
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,452
oh, my God.

5
00:02:33,452 --> 00:02:34,453
Oh, my God!

6
00:02:34,453 --> 00:02:35,954
Tony!

7
00:02:35,954 --> 00:02:37,956
Tony!

8
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,961
Oh, my God, Tony,
are you alright?

9
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:45,464
Uncle Ben.

10
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:47,466
What happened?

11
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,001
Hey.

12
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:24,002
What are you doing here?

13
00:03:24,503 --> 00:03:26,004
We had to drive out here

14
00:03:26,004 --> 00:03:30,008
'cause some schmuck st
the vcr from the common room.

15
00:03:30,008 --> 00:03:33,512
"Public Enemy,"
this is a great movie.

16
00:03:33,512 --> 00:03:35,013
For a class. ..just finished.

17
00:03:35,514 --> 00:03:37,516
We're out of here.

18
00:03:37,516 --> 00:03:39,518
40 grand a year to
watch old movies?

19
00:03:39,518 --> 00:03:40,519
Who's "we"?

20
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:43,021
Just a friend from class, okay?

21
00:03:48,527 --> 00:03:50,028
Your mom likes lavender.

22
00:03:50,529 --> 00:03:52,030
I'll be ready to bolt in a sec.

23
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:52,531
Mr. Soprano?

24
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:53,532
Yeah.

25
00:03:53,532 --> 00:03:54,533
Hey, I'm Noah Tannenbaum.

26
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:56,535
How ya doin'?

27
00:03:56,535 --> 00:03:58,036
I appreciate you
letting us screen here.

28
00:03:58,036 --> 00:03:59,538
Those Bose direct reflectors
make all the difference.

29
00:04:00,038 --> 00:04:01,540
You a film buff?

30
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,543
People say Hawks invented
the genre with "scarface,"

31
00:04:04,543 --> 00:04:07,045
but Cagney was modernity.

32
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:10,048
Muni was not, so I give
the nod to William Wellman.

33
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:14,052
Noah, I'm just gonna grab
the "Barenaked Ladies" cd,

34
00:04:14,052 --> 00:04:15,554
and then, let's hit the road.

35
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:22,561
Last year this course
is being offered.

36
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:26,565
"Images of hypercapitalist
self-advancement

37
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:28,567
in the era of the studio system."

38
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:31,069
So, you guys...

39
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:32,070
you and Meadow...

40
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:33,572
are you...?

41
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:35,574
Little early to say.

42
00:04:37,075 --> 00:04:38,577
What's your background, Noel?

43
00:04:38,577 --> 00:04:40,078
Noah.

44
00:04:40,078 --> 00:04:41,580
I'm from Los Angeles,

45
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,581
West L. A.

46
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:43,582
What I mean is--

47
00:04:43,582 --> 00:04:45,083
my family's in the business.

48
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:47,085
I mean show business, I don't
know why they call it "the business."

49
00:04:47,085 --> 00:04:49,087
Those old "Tarzan" movies?

50
00:04:49,588 --> 00:04:51,089
My dad's an entertainment lawyer.

51
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:55,093
What I mean is, we're Italian.

52
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:58,096
My dad is Jewish and my mother's
family is African-American.

53
00:04:58,597 --> 00:05:00,098
"Tannenbaum", right.

54
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:03,101
But on your application
to Columbia,

55
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:04,102
you didn't check
Jewish, did you?

56
00:05:04,102 --> 00:05:07,105
No, they can't ask about
religious affiliation.

57
00:05:07,105 --> 00:05:08,607
Oh, right, right, of course.

58
00:05:08,607 --> 00:05:10,108
What'd you check?

59
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:11,610
African-American.

60
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,612
So, we do understand
each other here?

61
00:05:13,612 --> 00:05:14,613
You're a ditsoon.

62
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:15,614
Excuse me?

63
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:19,618
Uh, charcoal briquette,
a mulignan.

64
00:05:19,618 --> 00:05:21,119
What's your problem?

65
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,121
I think you know
what my problem is.

66
00:05:23,121 --> 00:05:24,623
You see, your little
friend up there.

67
00:05:24,623 --> 00:05:27,125
She didn't do you any favors
bringing you into this house.

68
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,627
I don't know what the
fuck she was thinking.

69
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:30,629
We'll get to that later.

70
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:32,631
See, I got business
associates who are black.

71
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:34,132
And they don't want my son
with their daughters

72
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:35,634
and I don't want
their sons with mine.

73
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:37,135
Fuck you!

74
00:05:37,135 --> 00:05:39,638
See, that's the kind of thing
I'm hoping to avoid.

75
00:05:39,638 --> 00:05:42,641
So, when my little girl
comes down the stairs,

76
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:44,643
you're gonna say how
nice it was to meet me.

77
00:05:44,643 --> 00:05:46,144
Then you're gonna go
drop her off at school

78
00:05:46,144 --> 00:05:48,146
and you're gonna say goodbye.

79
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:50,649
C'mon, if you want to
see the Garden State.

80
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:53,151
We're gonna drop by Hunter's,
I want her to meet Noah.

81
00:05:53,151 --> 00:05:55,153
Then we'll be back
to pick up my laundry.

82
00:05:57,656 --> 00:05:59,157
Later, dad.

83
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:38,697
I don't got time for
these fucking attacks.

84
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:40,699
You were so good for months.

85
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:42,701
If you didn't instigate things--

86
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:44,202
I instigate?

87
00:06:44,202 --> 00:06:46,204
He's just a new friend, Tony.

88
00:06:46,204 --> 00:06:47,706
You didn't see the way they
were looking at each other.

89
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:50,208
You want her to be with
him, just keep it up.

90
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,710
Keep playing the race card,

91
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,212
you're gonna drive her
right into his arms.

92
00:06:54,212 --> 00:06:55,714
Not if I cut off
those fucking arms.

93
00:06:55,714 --> 00:06:56,715
Stop it!

94
00:06:57,215 --> 00:06:59,217
Let me deal with it,

95
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:00,719
if anybody's gonna
deal with it.

96
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:03,722
Make things worse
with your bullshit,

97
00:07:03,722 --> 00:07:05,223
I'm gonna be really pissed.

98
00:07:06,725 --> 00:07:09,227
I should call Cusamano.

99
00:07:09,227 --> 00:07:11,229
You might need stitches.

100
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:17,235
Yeah, if one of my sisters

101
00:07:17,736 --> 00:07:18,737
ever brought home
a fuckin' butterhead,

102
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:20,739
you know what my
old man would do?

103
00:07:28,246 --> 00:07:30,248
Hey, ma.

104
00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:31,750
Look who calls.

105
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,251
Actually, I'm standing
here in front of you.

106
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:34,753
Ah.

107
00:07:34,753 --> 00:07:35,754
Hey.

108
00:07:36,254 --> 00:07:38,256
So, how's it going?

109
00:07:38,256 --> 00:07:40,258
What do you care?

110
00:07:40,258 --> 00:07:42,260
Out of sight, out of mind.

111
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,763
Brought you some books on tape.

112
00:07:44,763 --> 00:07:48,767
Since you say you can't
concentrate to read.

113
00:07:49,267 --> 00:07:51,269
I wish the Lord
would take me now.

114
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,271
Well, in the meantime...

115
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:56,775
brought you "The
Horse Whisperer."

116
00:07:56,775 --> 00:07:58,276
Why, what's wrong, tell me?

117
00:07:58,276 --> 00:08:00,278
What, are you gonna freak out

118
00:08:00,278 --> 00:08:01,780
every time I try to do
something nice for you?

119
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,782
Jesus.

120
00:08:04,783 --> 00:08:06,284
What's this?

121
00:08:06,785 --> 00:08:10,288
She's going to finish baby
journals from long time ago.

122
00:08:10,288 --> 00:08:11,790
My idea.

123
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,293
Oh, yeah, I remember these.

124
00:08:15,293 --> 00:08:17,295
Carmela gave you one of these
for each of the kids

125
00:08:17,295 --> 00:08:18,797
when they were born.

126
00:08:18,797 --> 00:08:19,798
What the fuck?

127
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:21,299
Look at this.

128
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:24,302
Supposed to fill these out,
20 years, fat fuckin' nothing.

129
00:08:24,302 --> 00:08:28,306
Now, look here, I don't
like that kind of talk.

130
00:08:28,306 --> 00:08:30,308
Now, just stop it, it upsets me.

131
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:32,310
Carmela's ma returned
these books to the kids

132
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,312
filled with memories.

133
00:08:34,312 --> 00:08:36,815
You can't write stuff down from
your life for your grandkids?

134
00:08:36,815 --> 00:08:38,817
It's none of anybody's business.

135
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:41,319
Yeah, you're too busy
feeling sorry for yourself.

136
00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:42,320
She will do it.

137
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:45,323
It's good for her,
she realizes that.

138
00:08:45,323 --> 00:08:47,325
Keep her mind active.

139
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:50,328
Why do anything if there's
not something in it for her?

140
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,331
Alright, listen up.

141
00:08:53,832 --> 00:08:56,334
I want you to concentrate,
I know it's difficult.

142
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:58,336
Remember the airline tickets?

143
00:08:58,336 --> 00:09:00,839
The tickets were stolen.

144
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:02,841
Did you say that or
did the feds say that?

145
00:09:03,341 --> 00:09:05,343
What did you tell them
when you were in the lockup?

146
00:09:05,343 --> 00:09:07,345
What? What did I do?

147
00:09:07,345 --> 00:09:08,346
This is important.

148
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:10,348
They're trying to build
a RICO case against me.

149
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:13,852
What are you gonna say if they
put you on the witness stand?

150
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:15,353
'Cause the only reason
they let you go

151
00:09:15,353 --> 00:09:16,855
is to get your cooperation.

152
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:19,357
Don't wave your hanky at me.

153
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:22,360
What are you gonna say
from now on?

154
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,864
I never stated those tickets
were stolen, capisce?

155
00:09:25,864 --> 00:09:27,866
Now, Barbara will testify
I didn't say it,

156
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:29,367
but you gotta back her up.

157
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:31,870
I suppose I should've just
kept my mouth shut...

158
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,371
like a mute.

159
00:09:33,371 --> 00:09:35,874
In the future, any kind of
deal they try to make,

160
00:09:35,874 --> 00:09:38,376
you keep your mouth shut.

161
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:44,382
You know, for a year,
I didn't speak to you.

162
00:09:44,883 --> 00:09:47,385
Maybe I should've
kept it that way.

163
00:09:48,887 --> 00:09:50,889
Fuck it, do what you want.

164
00:10:36,935 --> 00:10:39,437
Did you say something to Noah?

165
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:41,940
If you're smart, you'll keep
walking down those stairs.

166
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,442
You did, what did you say?

167
00:10:44,442 --> 00:10:46,444
He was all quiet at hunter's,
she thinks he's a snob.

168
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:48,446
Now he's just sitting
out in the car!

169
00:10:48,446 --> 00:10:49,948
What, you didn't hear me?

170
00:10:49,948 --> 00:10:51,950
Maybe if I say it in swahili!

171
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,952
Meadow, can you
come up here please?

172
00:10:54,452 --> 00:10:54,953
What?

173
00:10:55,453 --> 00:10:57,956
I need your help
with this clasp.

174
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,460
That ain't our beer,
where'd you get this?

175
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,462
Well, it's good, ain't it?

176
00:11:04,462 --> 00:11:06,464
Is my laundry done?

177
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:08,466
You can sell ours
for the same price.

178
00:11:08,967 --> 00:11:10,969
I can't help it if
I have to buy from them.

179
00:11:10,969 --> 00:11:12,470
They tell me the same thing
that you do.

180
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,472
Ah, you're yella.

181
00:11:16,474 --> 00:11:18,476
Ah, please, you ain't
gonna slug me, are ya?

182
00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:44,502
What?

183
00:11:48,006 --> 00:11:50,508
Uh, your mother died.

184
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:52,510
You're kidding?

185
00:11:54,512 --> 00:11:57,015
I mean...

186
00:11:57,015 --> 00:11:59,517
Jesus Christ.

187
00:11:59,517 --> 00:12:01,019
Svetlana just called.

188
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,021
She said that...

189
00:12:03,021 --> 00:12:06,024
after dinner, your mother went
upstairs to get ready for bed.

190
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:07,525
When Svetlana came up,

191
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:10,028
your mother was under
the covers in her nightgown.

192
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:13,531
Svetlana thought she was asleep.

193
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:36,054
Svetlana's waiting
for us over there.

194
00:12:36,054 --> 00:12:37,555
She's dead.

195
00:12:37,555 --> 00:12:40,058
I'm sorry, dad...

196
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,062
that your mom died.

197
00:12:44,562 --> 00:12:46,064
Me too.

198
00:12:46,064 --> 00:12:47,565
Your grandmother loved you.

199
00:12:47,565 --> 00:12:49,567
She loved both you two...

200
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:51,569
very much.

201
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:32,610
They just removed.

202
00:13:33,111 --> 00:13:34,612
We saw.

203
00:13:34,612 --> 00:13:36,614
She was in no pain, Tony.

204
00:13:36,614 --> 00:13:39,617
What about the cause
of death, did they say?

205
00:13:39,617 --> 00:13:41,119
Massive stroke.

206
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:42,620
Yeah.

207
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,621
So...

208
00:13:44,122 --> 00:13:45,623
she will not be
finishing journal.

209
00:13:45,623 --> 00:13:47,625
I break promise to you, Tony.

210
00:13:48,126 --> 00:13:49,627
Does not often happen with me,

211
00:13:49,627 --> 00:13:52,130
that these old ones
get away with something.

212
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,631
Journal?

213
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:55,633
Nothing.

214
00:13:57,635 --> 00:14:00,638
Those "granny remembers"
books you bought her

215
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:02,140
when the kids were born.

216
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,143
She never touched them.

217
00:14:09,647 --> 00:14:11,649
What's your beef?

218
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:14,152
Asshole Robert Frost.

219
00:14:14,152 --> 00:14:15,153
How am I supposed to
know what this means?

220
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:18,156
Like I even care.

221
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:26,164
"Stopping by woods
on a snowy evening."

222
00:14:26,164 --> 00:14:28,666
Oh, my God, I'm so glad I'm
not in high school anymore.

223
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:30,168
You read this?

224
00:14:30,168 --> 00:14:31,169
Sure.

225
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:33,171
What does it mean?

226
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:35,673
I have to turn in a
close-read by tomorrow.

227
00:14:35,673 --> 00:14:36,674
What does it mean?

228
00:14:37,175 --> 00:14:38,676
"The woods are lovely
dark and deep,

229
00:14:38,676 --> 00:14:42,180
but I have promises to keep
and miles to go before I sleep."

230
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,681
Okay, look.

231
00:14:43,681 --> 00:14:45,183
Where is he?

232
00:14:45,183 --> 00:14:47,185
He's in a field on a horse.

233
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:48,686
He's not on the horse.

234
00:14:48,686 --> 00:14:49,687
The horse has bells.

235
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:50,688
So?

236
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:52,690
What kind of horse has bells?

237
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:53,691
I don't know!

238
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:55,693
Just give me the fucking
answer so I can write this?

239
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:57,695
A horse that's pulling a sleigh.

240
00:14:57,695 --> 00:14:59,197
Oh...

241
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:02,200
so, this is a Thanksgiving poem...

242
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,202
like, "over the river
and through the woods

243
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:05,203
to grandmother's house we go."

244
00:15:05,703 --> 00:15:07,205
No, it's not a Thanksgiving poem.

245
00:15:07,205 --> 00:15:09,207
What's covering the field?

246
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:10,208
Snow.

247
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,209
Yay!

248
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:13,211
And what does snow symbolize?

249
00:15:13,211 --> 00:15:14,212
Christmas?

250
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:15,713
Hello?

251
00:15:15,713 --> 00:15:17,215
Cold...

252
00:15:17,215 --> 00:15:20,218
endless white, endless nothing...

253
00:15:20,218 --> 00:15:21,719
I don't know!

254
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,221
Death.

255
00:15:23,221 --> 00:15:24,222
I thought black was death.

256
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:26,224
"He has miles to go
before he sleeps."

257
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:28,226
So, he must be far away
from his house.

258
00:15:28,226 --> 00:15:29,227
The sleep of death.

259
00:15:29,727 --> 00:15:31,229
The big sleep.

260
00:15:31,229 --> 00:15:32,730
He's talking about his own death,

261
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,233
which is yet to come,
but will come.

262
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:37,735
That's fucked up.

263
00:15:39,237 --> 00:15:41,739
Gottago.

264
00:15:41,739 --> 00:15:43,741
I thought black was death.

265
00:15:43,741 --> 00:15:46,244
White too.

266
00:15:46,244 --> 00:15:48,246
I'm coming, I'm coming!

267
00:16:14,772 --> 00:16:15,773
Grandma?

268
00:16:18,276 --> 00:16:21,779
I just can't believe it.

269
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:23,281
What are you gonna do?

270
00:16:23,281 --> 00:16:25,783
I'll call Janice.

271
00:16:25,783 --> 00:16:27,285
I'll meet you at Cozzerelli's...

272
00:16:27,285 --> 00:16:28,786
around noon.

273
00:16:28,786 --> 00:16:30,788
I already called.

274
00:16:30,788 --> 00:16:32,790
Ma didn't want any
kind of service, Tony.

275
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,292
No remembrance at all.

276
00:16:34,792 --> 00:16:38,796
So, we'll pick out
a simple urn or whatever.

277
00:16:39,297 --> 00:16:41,299
I'll see you there.

278
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:02,820
Proshai livushka.

279
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:05,323
Which means what?

280
00:17:05,323 --> 00:17:07,825
Goodbye, little Livia.

281
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:15,333
He's been in this situation
a million times

282
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,335
and has upped the ante when needed.

283
00:17:17,335 --> 00:17:18,836
Every time.

284
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:21,339
Let's see what happens
tonight, there he is,

285
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:22,340
he's pulling that in.

286
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,841
He's got the...

287
00:17:25,843 --> 00:17:26,844
Ton'.

288
00:17:26,844 --> 00:17:29,347
I'm sorry.

289
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:33,351
We all know...

290
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:35,353
how much you loved her.

291
00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:39,357
Thanks.

292
00:17:44,862 --> 00:17:46,864
I could imagine how you feel.

293
00:17:46,864 --> 00:17:48,866
Yeah, well...

294
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:50,868
what are you gonna do?

295
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:53,371
I'm sorry, T.

296
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:12,890
What are you gonna do, you know?

297
00:18:14,892 --> 00:18:16,894
At least she didn't suffer.

298
00:18:16,894 --> 00:18:18,896
Thank go that's right. D.

299
00:18:23,901 --> 00:18:25,403
My god.

300
00:18:25,403 --> 00:18:27,905
What next, huh?

301
00:18:30,908 --> 00:18:33,411
How is Tony taking it?

302
00:18:33,411 --> 00:18:35,413
Oh, what the fuck!

303
00:18:35,413 --> 00:18:36,414
Goddamn fucking bitch!

304
00:18:36,914 --> 00:18:38,916
She was so awful.

305
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:42,420
What do I tell my kids
when their own aunt

306
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,421
won't even come to a funeral?

307
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:44,922
Take it easy, I'll handle it.

308
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:54,432
And then he goes, "you gotta
work on Columbus Day weekend."

309
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:56,934
Eat your eggs, baby.

310
00:18:59,437 --> 00:19:01,939
Ace garage.

311
00:19:01,939 --> 00:19:04,442
You're not coming to your own
mother's fucking funeral?

312
00:19:04,442 --> 00:19:06,944
May I speak?

313
00:19:07,445 --> 00:19:08,446
You got your sister sobbing!

314
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:10,948
May I speak?

315
00:19:10,948 --> 00:19:13,451
Go the fuck ahead!

316
00:19:14,952 --> 00:19:18,456
You may recall, Tony, that I
have very good and valid reasons

317
00:19:18,456 --> 00:19:20,958
why I should not present myself
in the State of New Jersey.

318
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:23,461
Oh, Jesus, that case is
colder than your tit.

319
00:19:23,961 --> 00:19:25,463
It'd do you good to
show up here at this point.

320
00:19:25,463 --> 00:19:26,964
Nothing to hide.

321
00:19:26,964 --> 00:19:28,966
I don't do well at funerals, Tony.

322
00:19:28,966 --> 00:19:30,468
Who does?

323
00:19:30,468 --> 00:19:31,469
You just don't want to get your ass

324
00:19:31,969 --> 00:19:32,470
out of whatever chair it's in.

325
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:33,971
I'm gonna hang the fuck up!

326
00:19:33,971 --> 00:19:35,473
She didn't even want
a funeral, Janice,

327
00:19:35,473 --> 00:19:36,474
but can't you come
sit with your family

328
00:19:36,974 --> 00:19:37,975
during this stressful time?

329
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:39,477
She was your mother.

330
00:19:39,477 --> 00:19:42,980
You can just get on a plane
before us working folk.

331
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,482
Oh, listen to this,
Woody Guthrie over here.

332
00:19:44,482 --> 00:19:46,984
You know, they got special
rates for family death.

333
00:19:46,984 --> 00:19:49,987
Yeah, half of full fare coach,

334
00:19:49,987 --> 00:19:51,989
which at this late date

335
00:19:51,989 --> 00:19:54,492
comes to $1,100.

336
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:55,993
Fully researched
and everything, huh?

337
00:19:56,494 --> 00:19:58,496
Alright, fuck it, I'll pay it.

338
00:19:58,496 --> 00:19:59,997
Can I bring my fiancee?

339
00:19:59,997 --> 00:20:00,998
Fuck that!

340
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:03,000
One seat, coach.

341
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:04,502
And if you don't show up,
let me tell you right now,

342
00:20:04,502 --> 00:20:06,003
don't come breezing in here

343
00:20:06,003 --> 00:20:07,505
when it comes time
to carve up the estate.

344
00:20:07,505 --> 00:20:10,007
I know you think ma's got
money buried in the house.

345
00:20:13,511 --> 00:20:16,013
What are you telling people
about that other thing?

346
00:20:16,013 --> 00:20:17,014
Richie?

347
00:20:17,515 --> 00:20:19,517
He vanished into the
witness protection program.

348
00:20:19,517 --> 00:20:21,018
It's the truth, right, Janice?

349
00:20:21,018 --> 00:20:23,020
Cozzerelli's funeral home...

350
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,022
noon tomorrow.

351
00:20:25,022 --> 00:20:27,024
Does Harper know
his grandmother died?

352
00:20:27,024 --> 00:20:28,025
Him I'll pay for.

353
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:30,528
Bring him down from Montreal.

354
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:32,029
He is your son.

355
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:34,532
Hal is on the pavers,
Tony, he's um...

356
00:20:34,532 --> 00:20:36,534
a street person.

357
00:20:37,034 --> 00:20:38,536
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

358
00:20:38,536 --> 00:20:40,037
See, you're not the
only one with problems.

359
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:43,040
Be there tomorrow.

360
00:21:00,057 --> 00:21:01,559
Ain't you got
a drink in the house?

361
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:03,060
I wish--

362
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,062
there you go with that
wishing stuff again.

363
00:21:07,565 --> 00:21:09,567
I wish you was a wishing well...

364
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:12,069
then I could tie a bucket
to you and sink you.

365
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:14,572
Maybe you found someone
you like better.

366
00:21:19,577 --> 00:21:22,580
Oh, Tommy, let me
make you a cup of tea.

367
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,582
Listen, ma, I came over
to give you something.

368
00:21:25,082 --> 00:21:27,084
Here, take this.

369
00:21:27,084 --> 00:21:29,587
And when you need anymore,
just say so, I'm making plenty.

370
00:21:29,587 --> 00:21:31,589
We don't want your money,
I'm taking care of ma.

371
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:33,090
On two bits a week?

372
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,592
Ma don't go to night clubs
and she don't drink champagne.

373
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,593
How do you know?

374
00:21:35,593 --> 00:21:38,095
I used to dance
when I was a girl.

375
00:21:38,095 --> 00:21:39,096
Money don't mean nothing to me.

376
00:21:39,597 --> 00:21:40,598
No, I guess not.

377
00:21:40,598 --> 00:21:42,600
But with no heart and no
brains, that's all you've got.

378
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,601
You'll need it.

379
00:21:45,102 --> 00:21:48,105
Tommy, Tommy!

380
00:21:49,607 --> 00:21:51,108
Tommy!

381
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,127
His mother died last night.

382
00:22:10,127 --> 00:22:11,629
No shit.

383
00:22:36,153 --> 00:22:39,156
Ton', I'm so sorry to hear.

384
00:22:40,157 --> 00:22:41,659
What are you gonna do?

385
00:22:45,663 --> 00:22:47,665
I know how you feel.

386
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:51,168
We lost mom last year.

387
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:53,671
You remember?

388
00:23:07,685 --> 00:23:09,186
At least she didn't suffer.

389
00:23:09,186 --> 00:23:10,688
Ralphie, I need to talk to you...

390
00:23:10,688 --> 00:23:12,690
Albert...

391
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,191
you too.

392
00:23:14,191 --> 00:23:16,193
Vito, have a sfogliatelle.

393
00:23:16,193 --> 00:23:19,196
Carmela, she's gone.

394
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:23,701
C'mon.

395
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:35,212
Alright, who gave the order
to torch one of Albert's trucks?

396
00:23:35,212 --> 00:23:36,714
One of the trucks.

397
00:23:37,214 --> 00:23:38,215
Be quiet, Albert.

398
00:23:38,215 --> 00:23:39,717
Talk to him, he lit up
two of my dumpsters.

399
00:23:39,717 --> 00:23:42,720
What's the matter
with you?

400
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,221
Both of you.

401
00:23:44,221 --> 00:23:46,724
We're in the newspapers
every fucking week
with this shit.

402
00:23:46,724 --> 00:23:48,726
My crew...

403
00:23:48,726 --> 00:23:51,228
is in line for the raritan
township contract, okay?

404
00:23:51,228 --> 00:23:54,231
This guy over there keeps
whispering to Albert--

405
00:23:54,231 --> 00:23:55,232
your what?

406
00:23:55,232 --> 00:23:57,234
What did you say?
Whose crew?

407
00:23:57,234 --> 00:23:59,737
You're the boss, you
get to put in anybod
y you want over the crew.

408
00:24:00,237 --> 00:24:01,739
You're a captain, ralphie,
when I say you're a captain.

409
00:24:01,739 --> 00:24:04,241
And I'm gonna turn u
p my hearing aid
so I don't miss it.

410
00:24:04,241 --> 00:24:05,743
Oh, you're gonna
get cute with me?

411
00:24:05,743 --> 00:24:07,745
With my mother
lying dead?

412
00:24:07,745 --> 00:24:09,747
Raritan township,
the recycling manage
r over there, joe...

413
00:24:09,747 --> 00:24:11,749
zachary.

414
00:24:11,749 --> 00:24:14,251
He knows who's in line
for that contract.

415
00:24:14,251 --> 00:24:17,254
But he keeps playing
footsie with Albert.

416
00:24:17,254 --> 00:24:20,257
The next minute, he's threatening
to go to the EPA, bust us all.

417
00:24:20,257 --> 00:24:21,258
He said that?

418
00:24:25,763 --> 00:24:27,264
Alright, fix it.

419
00:24:27,264 --> 00:24:30,267
No-more-fires.

420
00:24:46,283 --> 00:24:49,286
Dude, I'm gonna ditch Spanish.

421
00:24:49,787 --> 00:24:51,789
I'll meet you by the trophy case.

422
00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:54,291
How could we possibly get busted?

423
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:55,793
Don't worry about it.

424
00:24:55,793 --> 00:24:57,294
The boys' room behind the stage?

425
00:24:57,795 --> 00:24:59,296
They never check in there.

426
00:25:09,306 --> 00:25:12,810
Mr. Soprano, Janice, Barb, please.

427
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,812
Accept my condolences.

428
00:25:16,313 --> 00:25:18,816
I'll use all my powers,
all my skills.

429
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:21,819
Don't go crazy,
I mean, you know.

430
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:25,322
Then we're not envisioning
any visitation hours for mom?

431
00:25:25,322 --> 00:25:28,826
Well, you see, she didn't want
any service of any kind.

432
00:25:28,826 --> 00:25:30,828
I find that hard to accept.

433
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,833
Is...

434
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:38,335
is she still down at
the hospital morgue?

435
00:25:38,335 --> 00:25:39,837
We brought mom
here this morning.

436
00:25:39,837 --> 00:25:41,839
She's downstairs.

437
00:25:45,342 --> 00:25:48,345
There's gonna be a priest
or something, though, right?

438
00:25:48,345 --> 00:25:50,347
Yeah, sure, a priest, I guess.

439
00:25:50,347 --> 00:25:54,351
What would that be?

440
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:55,853
You're not having a funeral mass?

441
00:25:55,853 --> 00:25:57,855
And I'm not trying to sell here.

442
00:25:57,855 --> 00:26:00,357
Well, she was Catholic,
but not religious.

443
00:26:00,357 --> 00:26:03,360
I thought maybe
we'd have a shindig

444
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,363
at the house, you know...

445
00:26:06,363 --> 00:26:09,366
after, so the grandkids
could, you know.

446
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:11,869
I don't know.

447
00:26:15,372 --> 00:26:17,875
I do know what mom's wishes were,

448
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:19,376
but not to have
a wake or a funeral?

449
00:26:19,877 --> 00:26:21,879
It makes us look like
we're unloving children,

450
00:26:21,879 --> 00:26:23,380
not to mention cheapskates.

451
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,381
Who gives a shit
what it looks like?

452
00:26:24,882 --> 00:26:25,883
The woman expressed her wishes.

453
00:26:25,883 --> 00:26:27,885
I wish to honor my mother.

454
00:26:27,885 --> 00:26:28,886
There's a lot of things
I could say right now

455
00:26:28,886 --> 00:26:30,387
that I'm not gonna say!

456
00:26:35,893 --> 00:26:39,396
What, you think we should
do something now?

457
00:26:39,396 --> 00:26:42,399
When she was young, she used
to picture her funeral.

458
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,902
Alright, fine, you want to
do something? Let's just do it.

459
00:26:45,402 --> 00:26:46,403
Let's just stop talking about it.

460
00:26:46,403 --> 00:26:47,905
Cozzerelli, you arrange everything.

461
00:26:47,905 --> 00:26:49,907
The wake, the funeral,
you send me the bill.

462
00:26:50,407 --> 00:26:52,409
I want you to know, Tony,
that this all won't fall on you.

463
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:55,412
I'll do a painting for
the overleaf of the program

464
00:26:55,913 --> 00:26:56,413
at the service.

465
00:26:56,914 --> 00:26:59,416
Motifs from the Mexican
day of the dead.

466
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:01,919
Oh, one thing I'd like
to suggest very strongly

467
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,921
is at the house, everyone gathers

468
00:27:04,421 --> 00:27:06,924
and each one can
voice a remembrance

469
00:27:06,924 --> 00:27:08,926
or a feeling about mom.

470
00:27:08,926 --> 00:27:11,929
No, no, I don't want any of
that California bullshit.

471
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:14,431
People can drink, they
can eat some gorgonzola,

472
00:27:14,431 --> 00:27:17,434
they want to yak about ma,
that's their business.

473
00:27:32,449 --> 00:27:33,951
No, "I'm sorry",

474
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:36,453
"my condolences", nothing.

475
00:27:39,957 --> 00:27:42,960
Actually, that's good.

476
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,461
It's a relief you're
not saying nothing,

477
00:27:44,962 --> 00:27:45,963
you want to know the truth.

478
00:27:48,465 --> 00:27:50,467
Everybody else, all bullshit.

479
00:27:57,975 --> 00:28:00,477
Here's the thing.

480
00:28:00,477 --> 00:28:01,979
I'm glad she's dead.

481
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:05,482
Not just glad, I wished she'd die.

482
00:28:05,482 --> 00:28:07,484
Wished.

483
00:28:07,484 --> 00:28:09,987
I had this court case coming up.

484
00:28:09,987 --> 00:28:13,991
She might have testified
against me, so...

485
00:28:14,491 --> 00:28:17,995
when I heard she was dead,
relief flooded into my veins.

486
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,003
How do you feel about
the fact that your own mother

487
00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:28,005
would have testified against you?

488
00:28:28,005 --> 00:28:30,507
Oh, c'mon, will you
listen to yourself?

489
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,512
I mean, is that right,

490
00:28:35,512 --> 00:28:37,014
wishing her dead?

491
00:28:37,014 --> 00:28:39,016
Is that being a good son?

492
00:28:39,016 --> 00:28:40,017
A good son?

493
00:28:40,517 --> 00:28:41,518
Yeah, a good son.

494
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:43,020
I mean, bad sons...

495
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,521
bad sons, what?

496
00:28:45,022 --> 00:28:47,024
They should fucking die.

497
00:28:47,024 --> 00:28:50,527
That's a fucking miserab'
disgusting thing to be,

498
00:28:50,527 --> 00:28:51,528
a bad son.

499
00:28:51,528 --> 00:28:53,030
I mean, your kid up at bard.

500
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,531
He better be a good son, right?

501
00:29:06,543 --> 00:29:07,544
You know, you're right.

502
00:29:07,544 --> 00:29:09,546
Why the fuck should I be a good son

503
00:29:09,546 --> 00:29:11,548
to that fucking demented, old bat?

504
00:29:11,548 --> 00:29:13,550
The fucking selfish miserable cunt?

505
00:29:16,053 --> 00:29:18,055
She ruined my father's life.

506
00:29:18,055 --> 00:29:19,556
Oh, yeah.

507
00:29:19,556 --> 00:29:21,558
But he wasn't her son.

508
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:24,061
What did she do to you?

509
00:29:24,061 --> 00:29:27,064
C'mon, that's a matter of
public record in here.

510
00:29:27,064 --> 00:29:28,565
We both know.

511
00:29:28,565 --> 00:29:30,067
You don't like to say it, do you?

512
00:29:30,567 --> 00:29:32,569
Who knows if she even
knew what she was doing.

513
00:29:32,569 --> 00:29:34,071
You're letting her off.

514
00:29:34,071 --> 00:29:35,572
My uncle denies it, you know,

515
00:29:35,572 --> 00:29:36,073
that she took part.

516
00:29:36,573 --> 00:29:37,574
Your uncle loves you.

517
00:29:37,574 --> 00:29:39,076
I never said he didn't!

518
00:29:39,076 --> 00:29:42,579
Grown children often secretly
wish for an aged parent to die

519
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:45,582
and it's not necessary
for the parent to be

520
00:29:45,582 --> 00:29:47,084
a witness for the prosecution.

521
00:29:47,584 --> 00:29:50,587
It's a taboo thought, but common.

522
00:29:50,587 --> 00:29:54,591
Particularly if the parent
has lost all capacity

523
00:29:54,591 --> 00:29:57,594
for joy at being alive.

524
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:07,604
So, we're probably
done here, right?

525
00:30:08,605 --> 00:30:10,107
She's dead.

526
00:30:16,113 --> 00:30:17,614
What's happening?

527
00:30:17,614 --> 00:30:20,117
Tony Soprano's mother's
wake is tonight.

528
00:30:20,117 --> 00:30:23,120
Want me to wear a wire?

529
00:30:25,122 --> 00:30:27,124
Why not, you need batteries?

530
00:30:27,124 --> 00:30:29,126
Let's go right over
here to office depot.

531
00:30:40,137 --> 00:30:41,138
Janice.

532
00:30:41,138 --> 00:30:44,641
I'm downstairs!

533
00:30:48,145 --> 00:30:48,645
Hey.

534
00:30:49,146 --> 00:30:50,147
Hey.

535
00:30:50,647 --> 00:30:53,150
Mom would want a closed casket,
don't you agree?

536
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,651
Definitely.

537
00:30:54,651 --> 00:30:57,654
They usually put a
picture on the casket,

538
00:30:57,654 --> 00:30:59,156
what do you think?

539
00:30:59,156 --> 00:31:00,657
Wow, look at that.

540
00:31:00,657 --> 00:31:02,159
She's smiling.

541
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,160
She looks...

542
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,662
normal.

543
00:31:05,662 --> 00:31:08,665
Maybe it was us kids who turned
her into a freakin' sourpuss.

544
00:31:08,665 --> 00:31:09,666
Maybe it was one of us.

545
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:11,168
Oh, get-- get the fuck--

546
00:31:11,668 --> 00:31:12,169
get off!

547
00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:14,671
Alright, alright!

548
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:24,181
You know, maybe
you're right.

549
00:31:24,681 --> 00:31:28,185
My shrink says that all women
are not cut out to be mothers.

550
00:31:28,185 --> 00:31:30,187
Is that a slam at me?

551
00:31:30,187 --> 00:31:32,189
No.

552
00:31:32,189 --> 00:31:35,192
Look, if my father was in the
freakin' "Cirque de Soleil",

553
00:31:35,692 --> 00:31:37,194
maybe I would've
turned out like har--

554
00:31:37,194 --> 00:31:39,196
Hal.

555
00:31:39,696 --> 00:31:40,697
This is fucking weird.

556
00:31:41,198 --> 00:31:42,199
What?

557
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:44,201
None of my childhood
schoolwork or artwork

558
00:31:44,201 --> 00:31:46,703
or anything, for that matter
is here anymore, nor Barb's.

559
00:31:46,703 --> 00:31:50,207
Get the fuck out of here.

560
00:31:52,209 --> 00:31:53,710
"Anthony Soprano.

561
00:31:54,211 --> 00:31:56,213
7th grade, Mr. Martino."

562
00:31:56,213 --> 00:31:57,214
I had him.

563
00:31:57,214 --> 00:31:59,216
"Why "fear strikes
out", by Jim Piersall

564
00:31:59,216 --> 00:32:00,217
is a good book."

565
00:32:00,217 --> 00:32:02,719
Take a look.

566
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:04,721
She only saved yours.

567
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:05,722
What are you talking about?

568
00:32:05,722 --> 00:32:07,224
Here's Barbara's
communion certificate.

569
00:32:07,224 --> 00:32:09,226
Here's her baby shoe.

570
00:32:09,226 --> 00:32:10,727
Yeah, that's it.

571
00:32:11,228 --> 00:32:14,231
Nothing of mine.

572
00:32:20,737 --> 00:32:22,739
Everybody agreed that I had

573
00:32:22,739 --> 00:32:26,243
extraordinary
visualization skills.

574
00:32:27,744 --> 00:32:30,247
Those pencil drawings
I did of grandpa.

575
00:32:32,749 --> 00:32:33,750
They're good.

576
00:32:45,762 --> 00:32:48,265
Ton', sorry.

577
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:53,270
Tony, I'm sorry.

578
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,272
He's disrespectful.

579
00:32:56,273 --> 00:32:59,276
Thanks for coming.

580
00:32:59,276 --> 00:33:03,280
Fucking motherfucking
pain in the fucking ass!

581
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,781
Could we not, huh?

582
00:33:04,781 --> 00:33:06,283
With the tantrums?

583
00:33:06,283 --> 00:33:08,785
For this shit, I miss the
Jet's first home game!

584
00:33:11,288 --> 00:33:14,291
Are they sayin' when your
making ceremony might happen

585
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:16,293
now with this delay?

586
00:33:16,293 --> 00:33:18,795
Stop asking fucking questions!

587
00:33:19,296 --> 00:33:21,298
Even if I knew, I couldn't tell you.

588
00:33:24,801 --> 00:33:26,803
Hit me, hit me.

589
00:33:30,807 --> 00:33:32,809
Every little bit helps.

590
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:35,312
Anything to get through these events.

591
00:34:09,346 --> 00:34:10,847
Hey.

592
00:34:15,852 --> 00:34:17,854
What a fuckin' blow.

593
00:34:17,854 --> 00:34:18,855
Not you too.

594
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:19,856
I'm serious.

595
00:34:19,856 --> 00:34:21,858
What are you...

596
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:24,361
breaking the terms of
your house arrest?

597
00:34:24,861 --> 00:34:26,363
I got a dispensation
from the marshals.

598
00:34:26,863 --> 00:34:28,865
She's my sister-in-law,
for chrissake.

599
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:33,370
My dad's very ill too.

600
00:34:36,373 --> 00:34:37,874
Thanks.

601
00:34:37,874 --> 00:34:39,876
Thanks for coming.

602
00:34:40,377 --> 00:34:41,878
Tony,

603
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:43,380
allow me to express my condolences

604
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,881
and those of the Eighth Ward.

605
00:34:44,881 --> 00:34:46,883
Thank you, assemblyman.

606
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:47,884
I met your mom once or twice.

607
00:34:47,884 --> 00:34:49,386
That was...

608
00:34:49,386 --> 00:34:51,888
a proud Newarker.

609
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:55,892
Oh, hey, hey.

610
00:34:55,892 --> 00:34:57,394
My sympathies, Tony.

611
00:34:57,394 --> 00:34:59,896
We talked about this
day, did we not?

612
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,902
You know State Assemblyman
Zellman, right?

613
00:35:06,403 --> 00:35:07,404
From the Eighth Ward?

614
00:35:07,404 --> 00:35:08,405
Do I know this guy?

615
00:35:08,405 --> 00:35:08,905
You bet.

616
00:35:09,406 --> 00:35:10,407
Yes, we go way back.

617
00:35:10,407 --> 00:35:11,408
How are you, Assemblyman?

618
00:35:11,408 --> 00:35:12,409
Reverend.

619
00:35:19,416 --> 00:35:21,418
Uncle Jun', you alright?

620
00:35:21,918 --> 00:35:24,921
They're droppin' like fucking flies.

621
00:35:25,422 --> 00:35:28,925
It's all that charcoal-broiled
meat you people ate.

622
00:35:28,925 --> 00:35:30,427
Nobody told us till the'80s.

623
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:32,429
I'm kidding you, you old fuck.

624
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:33,430
What's the matter with you?

625
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:36,433
Bacala said you wanted to see me.

626
00:35:36,433 --> 00:35:38,435
I gotta talk to that
wife of yours first.

627
00:35:38,435 --> 00:35:39,936
Uncle Jun', c'mon.

628
00:35:40,437 --> 00:35:42,939
This is a funeral, enough
of her soigne attitude.

629
00:35:54,951 --> 00:35:56,453
What do you want?

630
00:35:56,953 --> 00:35:58,455
I'm hoping that we can
use this sad occasion

631
00:35:58,455 --> 00:36:00,957
to put bitterness and
sore-headed feelings aside.

632
00:36:00,957 --> 00:36:04,461
I'll behave how Tony wants.

633
00:36:04,461 --> 00:36:06,963
I don't want to
add to his stress.

634
00:36:07,464 --> 00:36:08,965
There they are.

635
00:36:08,965 --> 00:36:09,966
Hi, Uncle Jun'.

636
00:36:09,966 --> 00:36:10,967
Hi, Uncle Jun'.

637
00:36:11,468 --> 00:36:12,469
How's that surfboard
I gave you?

638
00:36:12,469 --> 00:36:13,470
Ow!

639
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,971
Jun'...

640
00:36:15,472 --> 00:36:17,474
Tony's waiting.

641
00:36:27,484 --> 00:36:28,985
Ralphie Cifaretto

642
00:36:28,985 --> 00:36:31,488
got word to me.

643
00:36:38,995 --> 00:36:40,997
So, what does he want?

644
00:36:40,997 --> 00:36:42,499
He wants a bump up to captain.

645
00:36:42,499 --> 00:36:45,001
The kid's been a
top fucking earner

646
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:47,003
ever since that rat bastard
went in the program.

647
00:36:47,003 --> 00:36:48,505
You can't deny it.

648
00:36:48,505 --> 00:36:50,507
Ralphie's whipped Richie's
crew into shape over there.

649
00:36:50,507 --> 00:36:51,508
And three months ago by you

650
00:36:52,008 --> 00:36:54,010
the rat bastard was
the second fuckin' comin'.

651
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,512
Why do you do this to me?

652
00:36:55,512 --> 00:36:57,514
Because I'm the boss of
this family, you forget.

653
00:36:57,514 --> 00:36:59,015
I forget nothing.

654
00:36:59,015 --> 00:37:01,017
Don't make me say things
to you we'll both regret.

655
00:37:01,017 --> 00:37:03,520
Go ahead, I'm fucking fed up.

656
00:37:05,522 --> 00:37:06,523
Hey.

657
00:37:06,523 --> 00:37:08,525
I'm on the street.

658
00:37:08,525 --> 00:37:10,527
That's the arrangement.

659
00:37:10,527 --> 00:37:12,529
Stay home, clip your
coupons, be a happy man.

660
00:37:12,529 --> 00:37:14,531
Things are good,
I'll grant you that.

661
00:37:15,031 --> 00:37:16,533
But this economy is so robust,

662
00:37:17,033 --> 00:37:18,535
you get credit for shit
you had nothing to do with.

663
00:37:18,535 --> 00:37:21,037
Fucking chinks and housewives are
betting football.

664
00:37:21,037 --> 00:37:23,039
You better be finished.

665
00:37:46,062 --> 00:37:48,064
Joe Zachary?

666
00:37:48,064 --> 00:37:49,566
Yeah.

667
00:37:49,566 --> 00:37:51,067
Oh, boys,

668
00:37:51,067 --> 00:37:52,569
no fires.

669
00:37:53,069 --> 00:37:55,572
Tony doesn't want any fires.

670
00:38:29,606 --> 00:38:32,609
I ain't so tough.

671
00:38:37,614 --> 00:38:39,616
Well, Zach, what do you think?

672
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,617
Can't say.

673
00:38:40,617 --> 00:38:42,619
Well, we'll hope for the best.

674
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:44,120
Doctor...

675
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:48,124
this is Tom's mother,
brother, and Miss Doyle.

676
00:39:03,139 --> 00:39:05,141
The Lord bless her and keep her.

677
00:39:05,141 --> 00:39:10,146
The Lord make his face to shine
upon her and be gracious to her.

678
00:39:10,146 --> 00:39:15,151
The Lord lift up his countenance
upon her and give her peace.

679
00:39:16,152 --> 00:39:17,654
Amen.

680
00:39:27,664 --> 00:39:28,665
Did you talk to her?

681
00:39:28,665 --> 00:39:31,167
She's sure you said
something to him.

682
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:33,670
He won't discuss it, he clams up.

683
00:39:36,673 --> 00:39:37,674
Beautiful sendoff, T.

684
00:39:38,174 --> 00:39:40,176
Thank you, thank you.

685
00:39:50,687 --> 00:39:53,189
I want to thank you for
all you've done for her.

686
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,692
She was much work,

687
00:39:56,192 --> 00:39:58,194
but in the end, she defeated me.

688
00:39:58,194 --> 00:40:00,196
Anyway...

689
00:40:00,196 --> 00:40:03,199
we're not gonna be needing
your services anymore, obviously.

690
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:05,201
I'll be moving into the house.

691
00:40:05,201 --> 00:40:06,703
So, if you could
just get your stuff

692
00:40:06,703 --> 00:40:07,704
out of there by this weekend,

693
00:40:07,704 --> 00:40:08,705
I think that would be good.

694
00:40:08,705 --> 00:40:10,206
I stay there only during week

695
00:40:10,206 --> 00:40:12,709
when my fiance has
his children with him.

696
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:16,212
Tony says I can
continue situation

697
00:40:16,212 --> 00:40:18,214
until Bill and me find house.

698
00:40:18,214 --> 00:40:20,717
See, Tony should have
consulted me first.

699
00:40:20,717 --> 00:40:22,218
I'm gonna be living
at 55 Benedek

700
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:25,221
while we deal with the estate.

701
00:40:25,221 --> 00:40:27,223
Speaking of which...

702
00:40:27,223 --> 00:40:30,727
my mom had this kind of
extensive record collection.

703
00:40:31,227 --> 00:40:33,730
Caruso, Robert Merrill,

704
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,231
shitload of Broadway shows.

705
00:40:35,231 --> 00:40:37,233
Many of them were in
mint condition.

706
00:40:37,233 --> 00:40:39,235
Do you know where they are?

707
00:40:39,235 --> 00:40:40,737
She gave to me those records.

708
00:40:40,737 --> 00:40:42,238
What?

709
00:40:42,238 --> 00:40:44,240
She know I like American show
tunes, so she give to me.

710
00:40:44,741 --> 00:40:45,742
I didn't ask her.

711
00:40:45,742 --> 00:40:47,243
But those are my mother's records

712
00:40:47,243 --> 00:40:49,746
and I feel very close to them.

713
00:40:49,746 --> 00:40:52,749
I don't want to make
trouble, but Miss Janice,

714
00:40:52,749 --> 00:40:54,751
I feel I have to
respect her wishes.

715
00:40:54,751 --> 00:40:56,753
Oh, c'mon.

716
00:40:56,753 --> 00:40:58,755
This is just about you bogarting
those discs for your ass.

717
00:40:59,255 --> 00:41:01,758
Now, they're worth a fortune
to the right collector.

718
00:41:01,758 --> 00:41:03,760
I will not answer such here.

719
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,262
I want the entire discography

720
00:41:06,262 --> 00:41:09,265
back at the house
by this weekend.

721
00:41:15,138 --> 00:41:16,773
Mrs. S.

722
00:41:16,773 --> 00:41:20,777
How are you?

723
00:41:20,777 --> 00:41:22,779
Sit down.

724
00:41:22,779 --> 00:41:24,781
How's your mother?

725
00:41:24,781 --> 00:41:26,783
You call her every day.

726
00:41:26,783 --> 00:41:28,284
Mom passed away.

727
00:41:28,284 --> 00:41:29,285
Really?

728
00:41:29,285 --> 00:41:30,286
When?

729
00:41:32,288 --> 00:41:34,290
About six months ago.

730
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:37,293
Please give her my regards.

731
00:41:37,794 --> 00:41:41,798
Is she still on that crazy diet?

732
00:41:47,303 --> 00:41:49,806
I brought you something.

733
00:41:49,806 --> 00:41:51,307
Umm...

734
00:41:51,808 --> 00:41:52,809
from my restaurant.

735
00:41:53,309 --> 00:41:54,310
I don't know if you remember...

736
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,812
Vesuvio?

737
00:41:57,814 --> 00:41:59,315
Mrs. S.

738
00:41:59,315 --> 00:42:02,819
What's the matter?

739
00:42:02,819 --> 00:42:05,321
After what my son did to you...

740
00:42:05,321 --> 00:42:08,324
how can I look you in the face?

741
00:42:08,825 --> 00:42:09,826
What did he do now?

742
00:42:09,826 --> 00:42:12,829
You don't blame him
for setting the fire?

743
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:15,331
Artie, what are you doing?

744
00:42:15,331 --> 00:42:17,333
C'mon, we have people arriving.

745
00:42:17,834 --> 00:42:19,335
Let's go.

746
00:42:19,836 --> 00:42:21,337
Thank you so much.

747
00:42:21,337 --> 00:42:22,839
Thank you.

748
00:42:27,844 --> 00:42:29,345
Look at her.

749
00:42:29,345 --> 00:42:31,848
She's already becoming a robot
like the rest of us.

750
00:42:32,348 --> 00:42:34,350
I'm so sorry about your grandma.

751
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:35,852
At least she didn't suffer.

752
00:42:35,852 --> 00:42:38,354
All her innocence is gone.

753
00:42:45,361 --> 00:42:47,864
...comes to that point
in the service

754
00:42:47,864 --> 00:42:49,866
where the rabbi's supposed to extol

755
00:42:49,866 --> 00:42:51,367
the virtues of the deceased.

756
00:42:51,868 --> 00:42:55,371
The rabbi says, "alas, I did not
know this man, I'm new here.

757
00:42:55,371 --> 00:42:57,874
You all knew him, you say
something good about him."

758
00:42:57,874 --> 00:42:59,375
Dead silence.

759
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:00,877
Goes on for about a
minute, two minutes.

760
00:43:00,877 --> 00:43:04,881
Finally, a voice from the back,
"his brother was worse."

761
00:43:19,395 --> 00:43:21,397
I'm walking out with the provolone.

762
00:43:21,397 --> 00:43:24,400
And I think he thinks
I smell like that.

763
00:43:29,906 --> 00:43:31,407
This "survivor" show...

764
00:43:31,407 --> 00:43:34,911
somebody should find winner,
stick a pistol in the face,

765
00:43:35,411 --> 00:43:36,913
and say, "you not
gonna survive this

766
00:43:36,913 --> 00:43:40,416
unless you give me 25 percent of
that fucking million dollars."

767
00:43:40,416 --> 00:43:41,918
That's not bad.

768
00:43:41,918 --> 00:43:43,419
We could find out
where they live.

769
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,922
"See how good you survive this,

770
00:43:45,922 --> 00:43:46,422
you pezzo di merda."

771
00:43:47,924 --> 00:43:51,427
Everyone, please, may
I have your attention?

772
00:43:52,929 --> 00:43:54,931
At this time, we would
like to ask you all

773
00:43:54,931 --> 00:43:57,433
to join us in the great room.

774
00:43:57,433 --> 00:44:00,436
Form a circle, sit anywhere,
the floor, whatever.

775
00:44:00,436 --> 00:44:03,439
Get comfortable, so that
we can all be together

776
00:44:03,439 --> 00:44:07,443
and share a remembrance
or a feeling about the woman

777
00:44:07,443 --> 00:44:09,445
who has brought us all here today.

778
00:44:09,445 --> 00:44:10,446
Goddamnit.

779
00:44:10,947 --> 00:44:11,948
Please, everyone join us.

780
00:44:12,448 --> 00:44:16,452
Paulie Gualtieri, join us please?

781
00:44:19,455 --> 00:44:21,457
Thank you.

782
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,462
What the fuck did I say, hmm?

783
00:44:28,464 --> 00:44:32,468
If you'd rather, I can invite them
all back to her place.

784
00:44:32,468 --> 00:44:34,971
Janice, what are you doing?

785
00:44:34,971 --> 00:44:36,472
Very good.

786
00:44:36,472 --> 00:44:38,975
We could all take a break
from eating for five minutes,

787
00:44:38,975 --> 00:44:40,977
it won't kill us.

788
00:44:40,977 --> 00:44:43,479
Most of you will probably remember

789
00:44:43,479 --> 00:44:45,982
that this was her favorite song.

790
00:44:46,482 --> 00:44:49,986
I thought it might
help us get rolling.

791
00:45:51,547 --> 00:45:53,549
Herman? Rabkin?

792
00:45:58,554 --> 00:46:02,058
You two went back,
almost to the pyramids.

793
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,561
I...

794
00:46:07,063 --> 00:46:09,065
I guess what struck me most was...

795
00:46:09,065 --> 00:46:12,568
she didn't mince words.

796
00:46:21,077 --> 00:46:24,080
Between brain and mouth,
there was no interlocutor.

797
00:46:36,592 --> 00:46:38,594
Anthony Jr.

798
00:46:40,596 --> 00:46:42,598
I don't know what to say.

799
00:46:42,598 --> 00:46:44,100
Ah, c'mon.

800
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,102
Lay off him, Janice, move on.

801
00:46:48,104 --> 00:46:51,107
She was my best friend.

802
00:46:57,613 --> 00:47:01,117
If anybody died or was
in the hospital,

803
00:47:01,117 --> 00:47:05,621
I could be sure I'd get a call
from Lee letting me know.

804
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:15,631
Thank you, fanny.

805
00:47:15,631 --> 00:47:16,632
Thank you.

806
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:25,141
Okay.

807
00:47:25,141 --> 00:47:27,643
What's good for the goose...

808
00:47:31,147 --> 00:47:33,149
well, most of you will
probably remember that I have

809
00:47:33,149 --> 00:47:35,651
an extraordinary visual sense.

810
00:47:38,154 --> 00:47:39,655
When I was a child,

811
00:47:39,655 --> 00:47:42,658
my mother didn't let me
rest on those laurels.

812
00:47:42,658 --> 00:47:46,162
She didn't flatter me.

813
00:47:48,164 --> 00:47:53,169
She believed that wild
flowers blossomed best...

814
00:47:53,169 --> 00:47:55,171
among the rocks.

815
00:47:55,671 --> 00:47:57,173
With little water.

816
00:47:57,173 --> 00:47:59,675
She was tough.

817
00:47:59,675 --> 00:48:03,679
But she was right.

818
00:48:06,182 --> 00:48:08,684
And she's the reason
I make videos today.

819
00:48:17,193 --> 00:48:18,194
Tony?

820
00:48:19,695 --> 00:48:22,698
Maybe you'd like to tell them...

821
00:48:22,698 --> 00:48:26,702
how ma saved all your childhood
schoolwork and varsity letters

822
00:48:27,203 --> 00:48:30,206
and none of mine or Barbara's?

823
00:48:31,707 --> 00:48:33,209
You just did.

824
00:48:33,209 --> 00:48:35,711
Wrap it up, Janice.

825
00:48:42,718 --> 00:48:45,721
I hear she didn't suffer.

826
00:48:45,721 --> 00:48:49,225
For that we can be grateful.

827
00:48:51,227 --> 00:48:52,728
Thank you.

828
00:48:55,731 --> 00:49:01,737
They say there's no two people
on earth exactly the same.

829
00:49:02,738 --> 00:49:05,241
No two faces.

830
00:49:05,741 --> 00:49:08,244
No two sets of fingerprints.

831
00:49:08,244 --> 00:49:11,247
But do they know that for sure?

832
00:49:11,247 --> 00:49:14,750
'Cause they would
have to get everybody

833
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:17,753
together in one huge space.

834
00:49:17,753 --> 00:49:19,255
And obviously, that's not possible,

835
00:49:19,255 --> 00:49:20,756
even with computers.

836
00:49:22,258 --> 00:49:25,761
Not only that, they'd have to
get all the people

837
00:49:25,761 --> 00:49:26,762
who ever lived,

838
00:49:26,762 --> 00:49:28,264
not just the ones now.

839
00:49:28,264 --> 00:49:30,266
So, they got no proof.

840
00:49:30,266 --> 00:49:31,767
They got nothing.

841
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,281
Hey.

842
00:49:50,286 --> 00:49:52,288
So, Ton', she's dead.

843
00:49:52,788 --> 00:49:54,290
What?

844
00:49:56,292 --> 00:49:58,794
I guess our little secret...

845
00:50:01,297 --> 00:50:02,798
dies with her.

846
00:50:16,312 --> 00:50:19,315
Hey, pick that up!

847
00:50:19,315 --> 00:50:21,317
What am I doing out here?

848
00:50:21,317 --> 00:50:24,820
Everybody's in there
telling stories of her.

849
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,322
I got a beaut!

850
00:50:26,322 --> 00:50:27,323
Artie.

851
00:50:29,325 --> 00:50:31,327
Artie!

852
00:50:31,327 --> 00:50:33,829
Artie, don't talk about that!

853
00:50:33,829 --> 00:50:35,831
Mrs. Soprano may have passed,

854
00:50:35,831 --> 00:50:37,333
but who's to say there
isn't another Mrs. Soprano

855
00:50:37,833 --> 00:50:40,336
just like her or will be?

856
00:50:40,336 --> 00:50:44,340
Maybe not with the same fears
and paranoia, but...

857
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:46,342
the same.

858
00:50:49,345 --> 00:50:52,348
What I'm saying is...

859
00:51:00,856 --> 00:51:02,358
thank you, Chris.

860
00:51:02,358 --> 00:51:04,360
Thank you.

861
00:51:11,367 --> 00:51:12,868
Umm...

862
00:51:15,371 --> 00:51:17,873
this is such a crock of shit.

863
00:51:18,374 --> 00:51:19,375
Carmela.

864
00:51:19,375 --> 00:51:20,876
I'm sitting here thinking
I should protect my children

865
00:51:20,876 --> 00:51:23,379
from the truth about their
grandmother on the one hand.

866
00:51:23,379 --> 00:51:25,381
On the other, I'm
saying to myself,

867
00:51:25,381 --> 00:51:27,883
what kind of example
am I setting?

868
00:51:27,883 --> 00:51:33,389
Evading and smiling,
passing out cheese puffs...

869
00:51:33,389 --> 00:51:36,892
over a woman that we all know
was terribly dysfunctional!

870
00:51:36,892 --> 00:51:39,395
Who spread no cheer.

871
00:51:39,395 --> 00:51:40,896
At all.

872
00:51:40,896 --> 00:51:41,897
Carmela, be quiet.

873
00:51:41,897 --> 00:51:43,399
This is my house!

874
00:51:43,399 --> 00:51:44,400
I'm leaving.

875
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,901
Let her talk. Sit down!

876
00:51:45,901 --> 00:51:47,403
I'll speak if I want!

877
00:51:47,403 --> 00:51:48,904
Goddamnit, who are you,

878
00:51:48,904 --> 00:51:50,906
minister of propaganda?

879
00:51:50,906 --> 00:51:54,410
We suffered for years under
the yoke of that woman.

880
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:55,411
Years!

881
00:51:55,411 --> 00:51:57,913
She estranged us
from our own daughter.

882
00:51:58,414 --> 00:52:01,917
Ruined I don't know how
many goddamn Christmases,

883
00:52:02,418 --> 00:52:03,419
I don't want to
even begin to count.

884
00:52:03,419 --> 00:52:04,420
Hugh.

885
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,921
Don't hand me that!

886
00:52:05,921 --> 00:52:07,423
Bullshit!

887
00:52:07,423 --> 00:52:10,426
You wanted it, you got it.

888
00:52:12,428 --> 00:52:13,929
Here, here.

889
00:52:16,432 --> 00:52:18,434
From beyond the grave even.

890
00:52:19,935 --> 00:52:22,438
This is a woman who
didn't want a funeral.

891
00:52:22,938 --> 00:52:26,942
You all, her children,
you ignored her wishes.

892
00:52:26,942 --> 00:52:30,446
Only after she's dead,
by the way.

893
00:52:32,948 --> 00:52:34,950
She didn't want a funeral.

894
00:52:35,451 --> 00:52:37,453
She didn't want a remembrance
of any kind.

895
00:52:37,953 --> 00:52:38,954
Why?

896
00:52:38,954 --> 00:52:42,458
She didn't think
anybody would come.

897
00:52:46,962 --> 00:52:48,964
She wouldn't write down her
memories for her grandchildren

898
00:52:49,465 --> 00:52:51,967
because she figured nobody
loved her enough to read them.

899
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:57,473
She knew there was a problem.

900
00:53:12,988 --> 00:53:16,492
Um, there's desserts...

901
00:53:16,992 --> 00:53:19,995
in the dining room
if anybody wants some.

902
00:53:21,997 --> 00:53:24,500
Yes, um...

903
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:28,003
and they're all from Vesuvio.

904
00:53:28,504 --> 00:53:32,007
Our new pastry chef,
Bobby Vasquez.

905
00:53:32,007 --> 00:53:34,009
Thanks.

906
00:53:43,018 --> 00:53:45,020
Mike's here.

907
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:47,022
He's come to see you.

908
00:53:47,022 --> 00:53:51,026
You must like Mike
 a lot better than me.

909
00:53:51,026 --> 00:53:56,031
No, no, Tommy boy,
you're my baby.

910
00:53:56,031 --> 00:53:58,534
You're going to get
well and strong.

911
00:53:58,534 --> 00:54:00,536
All of us together again.

912
00:54:01,036 --> 00:54:06,041
I'm almost glad this happened.

913
00:54:17,553 --> 00:54:20,055
Yeah, this is Mike.

914
00:54:20,556 --> 00:54:22,558
When?

915
00:54:23,058 --> 00:54:24,560
You were?

916
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,561
Fine.

917
00:54:26,061 --> 00:54:27,062
Ma, they're bringing Tom home.

918
00:54:27,563 --> 00:54:28,564
They are, when?

919
00:54:28,564 --> 00:54:29,565
Right now, he's on his way.

920
00:54:30,065 --> 00:54:31,066
Oh, it's wonderful.

921
00:54:31,066 --> 00:54:33,068
I'll get his room ready.

922
00:54:33,068 --> 00:54:36,071
I knew my baby would come home.

923
00:54:37,305 --> 00:55:37,740

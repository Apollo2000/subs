00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

2
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,361
So...

3
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,864
...you know, usual girl stuff.

4
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,700
She picks up the dry-cleaning
and shops.

5
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:03,997
Dr. Melfi has excellent taste, she
only shops at the fancy-schmancy deli.

6
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:08,210
The kind with the Italian name
but they don't have meatballs.

7
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:09,920
All right, what else?

8
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:14,174
What am I supposed to be looking for?
What's up with this cooz?

9
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,426
It's none of your fucking business.

10
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,388
You're on a strict need-to-know,
lieutenant.

11
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,766
I should knock you out for
what you did to her date.

12
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:28,147
What? I scared your goomar's date
a little. What's the big deal?

13
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,777
-This guy still come around?
-No.

14
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:38,157
He's not her type. He's a coward.
He nearly pissed himself.

15
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,451
Anything else?
I don't want to be here all day.

16
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:44,913
Yesterday she got off
at 9 and she went to bed early.

17
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:46,874
That's it?

18
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,458
That's it.

19
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,463
Here, buy yourself an iron.

20
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:01,972
Ready?

21
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,809
Decaf, right?

22
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,611
So how was your college trip
with your daughter?

23
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:20,782
I tell you, my life is like an
episode of Provolone-something.

24
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,367
What's going on?

25
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,037
My wife. All we do is fight.

26
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,165
And she's jealous of you.

27
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,045
Is that something that you feel or
has it been discussed with Carmela?

28
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,631
She didn't know you were a girl.

29
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:40,802
You know, a woman.
Excuse me, a doctor.

30
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,596
Woman doctor.

31
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:45,807
-Why did you take so long to tell her?
-I didn't.

32
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,393
You spilled the beans
when you called.

33
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:53,273
Let me ask you a different question.
Why a female? Why a female doctor?

34
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:58,195
She asked the same frigging question,
and I sometimes wonder myself.

35
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:01,073
-And?
-I'll tell you what I told her.

36
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:06,161
It was between two Jewish guys and
a paesana. So I picked the paesana.

37
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:11,500
What's the one thing your mother,
wife and daughter have in common?

38
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,377
They all break my balls.

39
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,590
I know what you mean.
They're all Italian, so what?

40
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:23,220
So maybe by coming clean with me,
you're dialoguing with them.

41
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,430
Let me ask you a question.

42
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,767
Why do you have me as a patient?

43
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,231
Most legit people I know
wouldn't make eye contact with me.

44
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,857
But you...

45
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,985
...you didn't flinch.

46
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,669
-Water's warm, come on in.
-Hey, Sammy. How are you?

47
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,549
-I was just gonna make some coffee.
-Yeah?

48
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:01,800
How's Junior?

49
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,888
Sit the fuck down! Down!

50
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,893
That's how Junior is, Sammy.

51
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,313
I'm with little Jimmy Altieri.

52
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:18,358
Yeah, you paying Jimmy for this game?
Huh, Sammy?

53
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,526
No.

54
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,821
Are you paying someone for this game?

55
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,702
Now the party's over.

56
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,956
Junior Soprano is the new boss...

57
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,625
...and he ain't respecting
old arrangements.

58
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,377
Hey, you're lucky.

59
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,173
You stayed slender. You could
buy it right off the rack.

60
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,592
I want something special.

61
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,762
The boys are having
a little time for me.

62
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,348
You're wearing the suit
to the dinner, eh?

63
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:53,226
These guys today want to be buried
in a jogging outfit.

64
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:59,149
So how's your--
What's your oldest boy's name?

65
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,070
-Rafael. "Ralphie."
-Yeah.

66
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,780
-Good kid.
-Yeah.

67
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,282
He lost his son, you know.

68
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,867
What do you mean, "lost"?

69
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,578
Dead. Morto.

70
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:18,460
Just a fucking kid! A baby!

71
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,799
What are we talking about here?
You lost your grandson?

72
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:27,302
What are you gonna do with
these fucking animals...

73
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,138
...these drug dealers?

74
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,349
He used to run around breaking balls.

75
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,726
Dominic.

76
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,645
My namesake.

77
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,731
Did you know about this?

78
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:45,112
What'd I say about this poison?
These kids shouldn't touch it!

79
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:50,575
I read the paper every day about
these poor pricks overdosing.

80
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,370
He didn't overdose, he killed himself.

81
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,497
Fourteen years old.

82
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:59,167
-Jesus!
-Was this at Patterson Falls?

83
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,379
Holy shit, that was your grandson?

84
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,924
-What?
-He took one of those designer drugs.

85
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,969
Goes to the Falls, takes a header
right off the fence.

86
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:14,349
They said the current bashed his head
on rocks for days before he came up.

87
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,938
And meanwhile, this piece of shit...

88
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:25,152
...he gets to walk the streets and
sell more of this stuff to young kids.

89
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,987
Oh, really?

90
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,365
What's this motherless fuck's name?

91
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,373
-Even the coffee's old in here.
-How much can you complain?

92
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,834
Eventually, you've got a broken hip.

93
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,213
I want to give you a macchinetta.
It's the only way to get good coffee.

94
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,215
What are you wearing?

95
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,551
You smell like a French putain.

96
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,887
It's Canoe. Johnny wore Canoe.

97
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,556
Morning, Livia.

98
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,100
-Oh, good morning.
-Morning.

99
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,643
-Yeah, hi.
-New arrival?

100
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,937
Go ahead, keep moving, fella.

101
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,569
I'm happy for you, Junior.

102
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:11,490
I know how long you waited
to be made boss.

103
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,951
Just don't let certain people
take advantage of you...

104
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,703
...like they did to Johnny.

105
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,664
What certain people?
Nobody got over on Johnny.

106
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,083
Nobody's gonna get over on me.

107
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,795
How's your Jewish friend?

108
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,339
Hesh? What about him?

109
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,593
-Whoever heard of a Jew riding horses?
-He owns a horse farm.

110
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,888
He's Tony's friend, not mine.

111
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:39,684
-What have you got against him?
-Who, me? Nothing.

112
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,770
Johnny liked him.

113
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:47,150
And my son thinks every word that
comes out of his mouth is pure gold.

114
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:52,989
Are you telling me that since
I'm the new boss, I should tax Hesh?

115
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,456
Boy, Anthony must've really gotten
under your collar. Admit it.

116
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,709
You want to crack his coglioni
for putting you in here.

117
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,088
-What are you talking about?
-Yeah.

118
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,383
And I'm playing shortstop
for the Mets.

119
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,303
All right, watch the balls!

120
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,651
What is the matter?

121
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,696
Tony's cannoli doesn't
want to stand up?

122
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,490
Tony's cannoli's tired.

123
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,993
But I can make it happen, baby.

124
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,661
I know.

125
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,955
Just, maybe....

126
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,793
So how's your job?

127
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,336
What?

128
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,213
Since when do you care?

129
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,507
Can't I be nice?

130
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,551
All right...

131
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,012
...forget it.

132
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,142
You don't want to talk? Fine.

133
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,562
Here, go with somebody
who gives a fuck.

134
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,439
I'm not a fucking whore!

135
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,025
Stick your money up your ass!

136
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:14,446
-I don't know what's wrong--
-There's nothing wrong with me!

137
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,740
Just wanted to talk, that's all!

138
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,951
Talking with you,
I might as well be a fucking dildo!

139
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,913
If you were a dildo,
we wouldn't be fighting.

140
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,458
What does that mean,
you fucking refugee?

141
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,251
What does that mean?

142
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,129
Come here.

143
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,634
Want to fight me? Knock you out!
You fucking communist cunt!

144
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,349
Yeah, same to you!

145
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,478
You fucking burned me!

146
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,273
How you doing?

147
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,653
What do you got, Andrea?

148
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,038
-Clabby?
-Hearts.

149
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,248
Jump in, the water's warm.

150
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,418
Child's play. Pound a point.

151
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,509
-Hesh is outside.
-Tell him to come in.

152
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,012
He says he needs a word with you.

153
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:24,599
What the fuck?
You eat more queens than Lancelot.

154
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,524
What's up?

155
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,193
-Let's walk.
-That serious?

156
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,865
-You spoke to your uncle lately?
-Junior?

157
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,325
Yeah.

158
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,787
No. I don't know. Why, what's up?

159
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,833
-Your father was a fair man.
-What's that got to do with Junior?

160
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,668
Junior's not so fair.

161
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:55,630
Sometimes I wish you'd just get
to the point. What'd he do?

162
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,799
He's taxing me, Tony.

163
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,136
He's taxing you?
When did this happen?

164
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,345
Today.

165
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,806
Did you tell him you
operate without tax?

166
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,475
That my father loved you
and respected you?

167
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,979
That 10 cents of every dollar
in his kick is from you?

168
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:17,110
My uncle's boss of the family
10 minutes, already I got agita!

169
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,071
What'd you say?

170
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,450
It's a reasonable request
but an unreasonable figure.

171
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,827
What do you mean,
reasonable request?

172
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,787
He's the boss now, Tony.

173
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,458
He calls the tune, we dance to it.
That's the way it's done.

174
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:35,253
You can either respect that
or change the rules.

175
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:39,507
Tony, I came over here to tell you
with all this bullshit going on...

176
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,384
...I can't stay in this area.

177
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,052
Where you gonna go?

178
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,930
Come on.
I consider my royalty checks.

179
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,849
I wrote six gold records.

180
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,851
No, a couple of black kids did.

181
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,605
You just gave yourself a cowriting
credit. Come on, Heshie.

182
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,984
I know you. You leave this,
you're gonna kill yourself.

183
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,280
How much does he want?

184
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,909
500 large. Plus, two points
monthly on my shy.

185
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,580
All right.

186
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,835
Do me a favor, sit tight for now.
Let me think about it for a while.

187
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,563
How was that, baby?

188
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,023
The best.

189
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,985
You are the best.

190
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,113
Come here.

191
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,118
Tony, I love your cannoli.

192
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,705
You okay?

193
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,791
Yeah, I'm okay.

194
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,710
Go back to sleep.

195
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,133
Sure you're all right?

196
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:55,602
So, what do you want New York to do?

197
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,979
Junior can't know that we talked.

198
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,524
He's gotta think that Hesh came
to you on his own, by himself.

199
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,695
You are still running things.

200
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:10,533
The arrangement, whatever it is,
can't be insulting to my uncle.

201
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,827
Hesh has got to pay something.

202
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,121
I just haven't decided what.

203
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,505
I gotta get back. We'll talk later.

204
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,763
How's the veal?

205
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,681
It's like rubber.

206
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,558
Yeah?

207
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,606
Tastes all right to me.

208
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,108
Want something else?

209
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,085
Don't look at me.

210
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,712
Compliments of Johnny Sack.

211
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,137
Why don't you spend the rest
of our anniversary with him?

212
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,724
I was over there for 10
frigging minutes, Carmela.

213
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,727
-Don't do this.
-All right, Tony.

214
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,729
At least I know where I stand.

215
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,402
Why do you always gotta
be so dramatic?

216
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,737
Oh, here we go.

217
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,741
All right, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.

218
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,536
You don't even know what
you're apologizing for.

219
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,414
It's our anniversary, Tony.

220
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,625
Ours. Not yours, mine and
Johnny-fucking-Sack's.

221
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,419
Ours.

222
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,423
I thought we could get a room
at the Plaza like last year or....

223
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,550
I don't know. I don't--

224
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,477
I'm sorry, Carmela.

225
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:08,151
I just got a lot on my mind
and I'm not thinking straight.

226
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,113
Hey...

227
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,866
...I'm sorry.

228
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,705
Should I call the Plaza?

229
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,623
Come on.

230
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,877
No, let's go home.

231
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,432
Hey, come here.

232
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,769
Carm, what do you want me to say?

233
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,771
Tell me. I'm lost at sea here!

234
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,649
You've changed, Tony.
And I resent it.

235
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:53,196
It's destroying what little
self-esteem I have left.

236
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,323
Sometimes I think you skeeve me.

237
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,158
I skeeve you?

238
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,911
You're the mother of my children.
How could I?

239
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,330
You see what I'm talking about?
There.

240
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:07,668
"You're the mother of my children."
I'm just someone you procreated with.

241
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,963
You know it could be the Prozac.

242
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:15,134
Ginny Torrelli's been on it for years,
and she'd hump a fire hydrant.

243
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,845
Dr. Melfi said it had
different side effects.

244
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,681
Oh. She told you that?

245
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,991
Before we start today's session...

246
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,536
...we need to address the coffee.

247
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,873
It's not appropriate
of me to take gifts.

248
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,001
-It's a cup of coffee.
-Let's just make a rule, okay?

249
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,711
No gifts.

250
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,509
-Does this mean I can't drink mine?
-No.

251
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,010
Oh, I'm sorry.

252
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:03,307
I usually have my answering service on,
but I have a car emergency.

253
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:04,976
Yes?

254
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,063
What does that mean, "diagnostic"?

255
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,900
I just want to know what's
wrong with my car.

256
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,195
No. No, don't do anything.

257
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,157
No, I want to get a second opinion.

258
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:24,579
I'll take my chances. Thank you.

259
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,332
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

260
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,002
It's all right.

261
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,213
So how's it going?

262
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,506
Good.

263
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,133
Real good.

264
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,554
I think I may flush the medication,
you know?

265
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,973
See if the changes I'm feeling
are for real.

266
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,351
Why would you do that?
The Prozac seems to be working.

267
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,936
That might be the problem.

268
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:53,232
-It might be working overtime.
-What do you mean?

269
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,697
-I'm having a--
-Reaction?

270
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:03,242
You know, a side effect
from the stuff.

271
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,369
We talked about that.

272
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,247
Some people get insomnia.

273
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,792
Others, a stomachache or headaches.

274
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,377
But it usually passes.

275
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,797
But are there any other side effects
that you know of?

276
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,801
Some people experience
a diminished libido.

277
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:24,138
They have a hard time getting
or maintaining--

278
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,807
-Bingo!
-I see.

279
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:31,145
You know, not all impotence
is a result of the medication.

280
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:35,566
-There's something wrong with me?
-Have you had a prostate exam?

281
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,402
I don't even let anybody
wag their finger in my face.

282
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,950
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have laughed.

283
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,493
Don't apologize.

284
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,162
-Oh, boy.
-You got a nice laugh.

285
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:52,458
-All right, let's be serious.
-Hey. I'm serious.

286
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:58,965
You know that depression is also
a leading factor in impotence.

287
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:04,428
In the morning or at night
do you ever have an erection?

288
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,389
You could set your clock to it.

289
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,934
Okay, so we know it's not
a physical problem.

290
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,778
-Put that in after the credenza.
-Yes, ma'am.

291
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,657
What's going on?

292
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,867
Yeah, I bought some furniture.

293
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,204
Let's just move into Roche Bobois,
save the delivery charge.

294
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,706
Fine, I'll send it back.

295
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,792
No. But you've been spending
like a drunken sailor.

296
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,585
I said I'll send it back.

297
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,380
Mother of Christ,
I didn't say that, did I?

298
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,465
Jesus!

299
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,555
You shouldn't be telling my uncle
how to run things.

300
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:52,393
You think I got the balls to tell
your uncle how he should run things?

301
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:56,230
I shouldn't expect to see
the Statue of Liberty again if I did.

302
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,068
All right, look, Tony...

303
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:05,406
...Hesh isn't only a friend of
you guys, he's a friend of ours.

304
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,075
Somebody has to step in
so he doesn't get fucked.

305
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,202
I never said, "fucked."

306
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:15,041
You should've come to me first,
airing your dirty laundry in public.

307
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,753
How would it look if I went
to you after I spoke to him?

308
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,588
Now he's got a point.

309
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,548
Bottom line is...

310
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,509
...what are we gonna do?

311
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,850
You have a suggestion?

312
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:37,146
If there are any flies on you,
they're paying fucking rent.

313
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,611
500's a little steep
for back taxes, no?

314
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:49,200
The 2 percent of his action,
that's up to you. It affects Tony...

315
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,160
...as much as Hesh.

316
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,080
I'm not out to hurt anyone.

317
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,166
God forbid I get in the way
of someone earning.

318
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,629
One and a half on the shy business
and 300 on the back tax.

319
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:02,797
250.

320
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,139
Hold on to your cock when you
negotiate with these desert people.

321
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,310
250.

322
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,230
All right.

323
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,131
Mr. Soprano.

324
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,349
You want sex?

325
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:56,976
No.

326
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,521
Go back to sleep.

327
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:16,745
You know, you have a nice body.
You should make it work for you more.

328
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,372
Oh, really?

329
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,708
Yeah, you reveal too much.

330
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,210
You don't want other men
looking at me?

331
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:26,130
No, when you're not with me,
you do what you want.

332
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:31,135
But I'm saying maybe you could
wear a nice businesslike outfit.

333
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,387
I think I could get into that.

334
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,723
-You want me to dress like a man?
-No.

335
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,642
I don't want you to dress like a man.

336
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:42,730
I'm just saying maybe wear something
a little more professional.

337
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,315
Like you're in business.

338
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,735
-Well, fuck you, Tony. I'm no whore.
-No.

339
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:51,655
That's not what I mean, not like
you're in the whore business....

340
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,199
Oh, forget it.

341
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,078
Come here.

342
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,919
Is everyone in my life
bananas or what?

343
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,339
Get over here!

344
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,093
-Come--
-Go jerk off!

345
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,514
Yeah. Go jerk off.

346
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,016
Look at this. She burned me.

347
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,018
That's not good.

348
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,687
What led up to that?

349
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,731
Carmela can be pretty violent.

350
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,528
This added problem
that I've been having...

351
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:34,615
...I just thought we needed
to spice things up a little bit.

352
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:39,954
If it's not the Prozac, then maybe
I just need a little jump-start.

353
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,582
I suggested that maybe she dress
a little different.

354
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,377
-Something titillating?
-Yeah.

355
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,003
Maybe it'd help.

356
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,048
So I suggested to her...

357
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,591
...not demanded...

358
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,677
...suggested...

359
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,013
...you know, maybe dress
a little sexier.

360
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:03,227
-But Carmela can be very sensitive.
-Maybe she felt it degraded her.

361
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,980
Not all women are into sexy lingerie.

362
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,315
It's not about dressing like that.

363
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,150
Then what are we talking about?

364
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:14,446
Some women are sexier when
they dress simple.

365
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,740
You know, understated.

366
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,660
And I don't mean....

367
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,708
Fuck it, I don't know what I mean.

368
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,505
Like you.

369
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,757
How like me?

370
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,509
You play it down.

371
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:42,558
Now, it's obvious you got
a killer body under there.

372
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:43,934
Don't get me wrong.

373
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:48,022
-All right.
-Not only do you play it down...

374
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,484
...but you're gentle.

375
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,070
Not loud.

376
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,364
Sweet-sounding.

377
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,743
Like a mandolin.

378
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,500
Anthony.

379
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,886
Unfortunately,
we have to stop now.

380
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:22,139
I think it's important
that we talk about this.

381
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:25,559
Do you think you could come back
later this afternoon?

382
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,853
No.

383
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,442
Till Tuesday.

384
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,236
Okay?

385
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,243
Yeah, all right.

386
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,246
See you Tuesday.

387
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:56,066
It's the oddest thing.
I've had this problem for weeks.

388
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:59,778
But this morning, I get in
and it starts right up.

389
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,697
And then again at the deli.

390
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,407
Looks fine.

391
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:06,744
Are you sure?
I was told I need a new starter.

392
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:09,705
Lady...

393
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:15,169
...as much as I might wish to rob you,
I won't try to replace a new starter.

394
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:17,212
-What do you mean, "new"?
-New.

395
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,174
It has everything but
the price tag hanging from it.

396
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,724
I didn't do nothing!

397
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:31,810
Poor kid committed suicide
up here because of you.

398
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,021
-You fucking know me!
-I know you.

399
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:40,444
Listen, big boy. Listen to me,
I'm gonna give you a break.

400
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,864
I'm gonna give you a break.
When I toss you over...

401
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:48,869
...when I toss you over, if you fly,
I won't shoot you down. Deal?

402
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,370
No!

403
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,830
No!

404
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:17,606
Well, my goodness.

405
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,026
What happened here?

406
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,614
Some sad shit.

407
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:28,492
Motherfucker said he didn't
want to live no more.

408
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,619
Jumped.

409
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,586
How much you give him?

410
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:56,478
I thought I was the only one Junior
could make look like that.

411
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,234
All right, let me hear it.

412
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,612
Rusty Irish.

413
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,406
What about him?

414
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,949
Took a header off the Falls.

415
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,869
It's the closest that junkie
ever got to a bath.

416
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,247
I got news for you. That
junkie was my biggest earner.

417
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:19,918
He moved more cards than 10 guys
put together. And another thing:

418
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:23,630
He should've checked with me
before he did a favor for Capri.

419
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:26,466
You're losing me.

420
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,219
Irish sold Capri's grandson that shit.

421
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:33,849
-You created a Frankenstein in Junior.
-I created?

422
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,019
We agreed to let Junior have his day.

423
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:41,189
"Let him be the lightning rod,
and when somebody goes down...

424
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,318
...he's not a young man with a family."
We agreed.

425
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:47,154
We agreed, but who expected
to get raped?

426
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:51,491
When Jackie was boss, it all
evened out at the end of the day.

427
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,411
But your uncle, Madonna,
does he eat alone!

428
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,663
He doesn't even pass the salt.

429
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:02,336
What about Sammy Grigio's card game?
Mikey beat him up. That ain't right.

430
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,213
Even a broken clock is right
twice a day.

431
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:08,967
Junior had a position.
That game wasn't paying anybody.

432
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:13,347
The minute Sammy Grigio used Jimmy's
name, it should've been end of story.

433
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,098
That's right.

434
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:21,271
-What do you want me to do?
-We made our bed, we sleep in it.

435
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:24,316
How long will we kick upstairs
without it hurting?

436
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,444
Something, anything should
trickle down over here, no?

437
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,198
All we want you to do is talk to him.

438
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,867
After all, he's your uncle. Come on.

439
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,452
That's right.

440
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,259
-Who is it?
-It's me, Ma.

441
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,221
-Who?
-Anthony.

442
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,473
Open the door.

443
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:06,066
I thought it was the Activities lady.
She's a real pain in the ass.

444
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,943
Playing bingo, Livia?

445
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,195
Oh, not tonight, honey.

446
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,781
You know, she's a degenerate gambler.

447
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,409
Milly. Milly?

448
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,536
My son.

449
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:19,997
Handsome.

450
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,633
So how's it going?

451
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:34,177
Oh, what can I say?

452
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,971
Hey, this is great!

453
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:39,808
You only need that broken reading lamp
you had by the phone at home.

454
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,561
And I got it downstairs.
I can bring it.

455
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,729
Listen!

456
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,273
Oh, she's driving me crazy!

457
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,817
-Who?
-Next door!

458
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,444
There it is again.

459
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:56,783
That's enough water!
How much water does she need?

460
00:33:56,993 --> 00:34:01,621
She runs the water all day.
Water, water, water!

461
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,791
I'm living next door to Gunga Din!

462
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,961
I went to Ferrara's.
I got you biscotti.

463
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,379
-Almonds?
-Yeah.

464
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,715
All right. Leave them there.

465
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:15,177
I'll take them downstairs
later for my coffee.

466
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:21,850
Uncle Jun been by?

467
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:27,147
Oh, once in a while.
It makes him uncomfortable here.

468
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:31,610
He's got a lot on his mind. More
responsibilities means more headaches.

469
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,404
Better men than him had to work hard.

470
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,614
Yeah?

471
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,532
He'll be all right.

472
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,410
If he remembers who his friends are.

473
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:46,291
I'd hate to see him mess up.
He's been waiting a long time.

474
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:47,751
What do you mean?

475
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:51,463
It's not a business that
forgives bad decisions.

476
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,800
And I hate to see him making
wrong moves, you know.

477
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:59,638
-Especially at the beginning.
-Why you telling me? Tell him.

478
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,848
Ma, you got his ear.

479
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,184
He listens to you.

480
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,728
I don't know that world.

481
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,647
No, of course not.

482
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,609
But if anything, you know,
were to come up, that's all.

483
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,611
I don't want to get involved.

484
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:18,365
If you have something to say to
your uncle, bring it up to him.

485
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:25,038
-Oh, I wish the Lord would take me.
-Come on, Ma.

486
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,376
There's plenty of nice gents
that want a date with you.

487
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,378
Look. I'm going downstairs.

488
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:36,383
I'm going downstairs before that
che bruta Activities lady finds me.

489
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,385
You want coffee?

490
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,054
-Yeah, all right.
-Bring the cookies!

491
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:46,351
Carmela, I don't want to sound
like religion is a cure-all...

492
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,646
...but if Tony got more
involved with the Church...

493
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:53,191
...it may help to expedite things
in his therapy.

494
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,903
What's killing me is that
this is a self-inflicted wound.

495
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,822
I pushed for it.

496
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:02,492
I could deal with the goomars.
I knew I was better than them.

497
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:08,123
As stupid as it sounds, I viewed them
as a form of masturbation for him.

498
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:11,251
I couldn't give him what
he needed all the time.

499
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,421
You're a man.
You know that thirst.

500
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:20,218
I was too busy with the house
and the kids to quench it.

501
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,389
But this psychiatrist...

502
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,309
...you know, she's not just a goomar.

503
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:32,939
Now I feel like he's really cheating
and I'm the one who's thirsty.

504
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,651
I'm not gonna stay in a marriage
that's made--

505
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,030
Let's not even think about that.

506
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:45,869
Divorce is for those who never intended
on dying married in the first place.

507
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,625
You know, Carm, we reap what we sow.

508
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,127
What do you mean?

509
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,339
You admit to accepting
his dalliances in the past.

510
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,591
Schifosas.
They meant nothing.

511
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,721
But you said it was like they were
"lightening the workload"...

512
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:08,516
...providing a wife's duty
when you were too busy.

513
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,977
You practically welcomed it.

514
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,523
Now, I want you to pray...

515
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:20,528
...to our Holy Mother, ask her
for guidance and forgiveness...

516
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,115
...so that you can get through
this as a couple.

517
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:29,120
You're not without sin
in this, Carmela.

518
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,457
So she's out of control.

519
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,044
She spends money like we're
the Sopranos of Park Avenue.

520
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,589
But you've noticed her.
Which may have been the point.

521
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,178
Look, before we run out of time...

522
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:49,766
...I'd like to discuss what happened
when we were here last week.

523
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,355
How's your car?

524
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,277
Did you steal my car
and have it fixed?

525
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:07,284
-We had an agreement, no gifts.
-I didn't want you to get robbed.

526
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:08,868
It was you.

527
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:13,081
You had no right to steal my car.

528
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,001
I've been scared to death.

529
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,377
-Why?
-Why?

530
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:21,047
It's a violation of my privacy.
What else have you done?

531
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,636
Answer me.

532
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,433
I love you.

533
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,060
-Anthony.
-I'm in love with you.

534
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:38,064
I'm sorry. It's just the way it is.

535
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,066
-Okay. Let me talk.
-No.

536
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,319
It's not the Prozac.

537
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,864
I dream about you.

538
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,783
I think about you all the time.

539
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,077
I can't get excited about
other women.

540
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,414
There's nothing else to say.

541
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,209
I love you.

542
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,211
Let me start here.

543
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:03,548
I know this may be very hard
for you to swallow.

544
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:08,178
But you're only feeling this way
because we've made such progress.

545
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:11,473
-What?
-I've been gentle. That's my job.

546
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:15,810
I listen. That's what I do best.

547
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:19,189
I've been a broad, generic,
sympathetic woman to you...

548
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:22,275
...because that's what
this work calls for.

549
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:28,865
You've made me all of the things
you feel are missing in your wife.

550
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,659
And in your mother.

551
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:42,504
You're making me out to be
some fucking mama's boy.

552
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,631
I'm a man.

553
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,883
And you're a woman.

554
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:49,219
End of story.

555
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,972
And this crap about Freud and...

556
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:57,519
...every boy wanting to have sex with
his mother, that's not gonna fly here.

557
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:00,063
I didn't say that.

558
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:03,024
I want to make sure
we understand each other.

559
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,485
Yeah, we understand each other.

560
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,073
You don't love me.

561
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,247
You don't want me
to come back anymore.

562
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,457
It's quite the opposite.

563
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:23,503
This is all a byproduct of progress.

564
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,672
Has someone been following me?

565
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,676
Okay, forget it.

566
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,179
I'll see you next week.

567
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,358
All right, let's go!

568
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,653
-Listen, Uncle Junior--
-You could've made the pros.

569
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:52,198
You could've done it.
You had a swing like Joe D.

570
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,783
-You're crazy.
-What?

571
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:55,535
You think I'm shitting you?

572
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,955
-I could barely hit .250.
-Because you didn't want it.

573
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:02,792
Too busy chasing skirt.
Chasing skirt, your average was .500.

574
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:06,504
-Yeah, what happened?
-What did you want to talk about?

575
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,132
Octavian.

576
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:14,053
-You know, Augustus.
-You fucking with me?

577
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:17,515
No. Octavian became Augustus.

578
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,561
Forget about that.

579
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:26,232
Bottom line: Augustus was a Caesar.
And everybody loved him, right?

580
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,153
-You know why?
-I don't know that I give a fuck.

581
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:34,449
Everybody loved him because
he never ate alone. Capisci?

582
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,410
It was the longest time of peace
in Rome's history.

583
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:41,414
He was a fair leader and all
his people loved him for that.

584
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,167
Is this the one that
they stabbed in the back?

585
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:47,128
No, that was Julius.
Talking about Augustus.

586
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:50,632
He shared his wealth and
all his people loved him.

587
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,675
You said that three times.

588
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:56,137
I heard it. His people loved him.
What's your point?

589
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:02,560
Remember when you told me
about the bull and his son?

590
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,939
They're looking out
at a bunch of cows.

591
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:10,360
The son says, "Dad, why don't we
run down and fuck one of these cows?"

592
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,945
What did the dad say?

593
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:17,450
The father says, "Son, why don't we
walk down there and fuck them all?"

594
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:22,205
I told you that?
"Why don't we fuck them all."

595
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,915
That's funny.

596
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,377
Okay, I get your point.

597
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,797
Why all of this fucking
Augustus-Octavian shit?

598
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,382
I don't know.

599
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:36,636
Are you okay? You've been
acting mezzo morto lately.

600
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,180
I ain't seen you like that for years.

601
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:44,018
I'm okay. It's just bullshit stuff.
Don't worry about it.

602
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,689
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, yeah. I'm okay.

603
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:55,446
Junior took your 250 and
split it amongst the top five guys.

604
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,365
So he doesn't look greedy.

605
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,783
-Smart move.
-Yeah.

606
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:01,202
Your uncle may be another
Harry Truman.

607
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,205
-What's that mean?
-Truman had a big job thrust on him.

608
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:08,710
He didn't want it, but in the end
he made some pretty wise decisions.

609
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,212
Your uncle may be the right man.

610
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,215
I fucking hope so.

611
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,509
I'll tell you, I don't want the job.

612
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,595
Let Junior die from the stress.

613
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:22,140
That's what gave Jackie the cancer,
God rest his soul.

614
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,851
"Boss." Fuck it, who needs it?

615
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,155
It's nice here.

616
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:40,700
I can't stand the smell.
The shit, flies all over.

617
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:44,871
But I could watch them for hours.
There's a kind of beauty to it.

618
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,205
I envy them.

619
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:48,625
-I wouldn't go that far.
-I would.

620
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:53,713
They got no bills, no headaches,
no family cazzi running around.

621
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,507
One horse likes another one,
they fuck. That's it.

622
00:43:56,759 --> 00:44:00,303
No problems. No hundred questions.
No guilt.

623
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,642
I don't know what I'm talking about.

624
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,895
So Junior split my money
and spread it around?

625
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,649
-Yeah.
-Five bosses, 50 a pop.

626
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,983
Not a bad day's pay.

627
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,404
Still, I wish it wasn't your money.

628
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,908
You know, it makes me feel terrible.

629
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:25,870
What?

630
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,417
You old fucking Jew.

631
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,879
Here's my share.
I don't want to profit off you.

632
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,010
Never entered my mind.

633
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:04,117
Dr. Melfi, there's nothing there,
you know.

634
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:06,577
You don't have to explain
nothing, Tony.

635
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:14,377
In psychiatry, apparently what you're
feeling is not what you're feeling.

636
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:17,380
And what you're not feeling
is your real agenda.

637
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:34,772
-You're gonna stick with it, right?
-I don't know.

638
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,816
I think you should.

639
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,526
You do?

640
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:43,948
I was jealous.

641
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:47,034
-I should've--
-Wait, let me finish, Tony.

642
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,622
I've been thinking a lot about this.

643
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,044
I was jealous of her ability
to help you.

644
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:01,340
To be a sort of salvation to you.

645
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,885
I talked to Father Phil and...

646
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:08,014
...I want to be that woman
in your life.

647
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,398
Carm, you're not just in my life...

648
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,526
...you are my life.

649
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:26,574
Come here.

650
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,803
I'm no good at speeches.

651
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:50,056
Owe him a dime,
you'll hear some great speeches.

652
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:53,267
Shit. Shut up, let me talk.

653
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,228
Go ahead. I was only kidding.

654
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:58,397
I'd like everybody
to raise their glasses.

655
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:09,742
Okay.

656
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:15,498
Taught me as much as anybody,
except for maybe my father.

657
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,253
Even if he wasn't my uncle...

658
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,422
...I'd be standing here saying:

659
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,174
"To our new boss."

660
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,760
Salute.

661
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:31,931
To Junior.

662
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,183
Junior.

663
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,353
To Junior.

664
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,438
Salute.

664
00:47:40,305 --> 00:48:40,933

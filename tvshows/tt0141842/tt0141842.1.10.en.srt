{7328}{7371}Thank you.
{7375}{7456}Let's just say, after how many|years with tony Soprano's crew,
{7460}{7516}some shit has finally|worked out.
{7520}{7603}Just when I was starting|to wonder if, you know...
{7640}{7713}whose fuckin' welfare check|you gotta cash to get|a burger around here?
{7717}{7761}Shut the fuck up!
{7765}{7858}Wouldn't it be cool to own a|restaurant like la cirque?
{7870}{7926}Come on with the careers.
{7930}{8034}- That black guy over there...|he look familiar?|- You have my money.
{8038}{8106}Why don't you just forget about|workin' and be with me?
{8110}{8205}Oh, yeah. And be one of those|wives like Carmela Soprano?
{8217}{8274}Breast-feed a bunch of rugrats and|then spend the rest of your life...
{8278}{8334}at the gym, just you|and your stretch marks.
{8338}{8381}You're right.
{8385}{8454}Cousin's always had a brain,|but what does she use it for?
{8458}{8530}A husband who can't even tell|you where the money comes from.
{8542}{8615}Yo, hair net central, what am I|back here, Mark Fuhrman?
{8625}{8676}- You a dick!|- Would you chill?
{8680}{8724}It's fuckin'|discrimination already.
{8728}{8784}Hey.
{8788}{8835}'Bout time.
{9150}{9196}Bold men make|bold statements.
{9200}{9291}Why'd they send you over? I'm lookin'|for a burger, not converted rice.
{9295}{9383}Your woman looks embarrassed.
{9478}{9575}Come on, eh? Give me a|couple of burger baskets.
{9635}{9730}He's only bold, because he's|semi-hooked up with the Tony Soprano crew.
{9863}{9906}What's with the attitude,|Christopher?
{9910}{9954}If it's not the blacks,|it's somebody else.
{9958}{10030}Whoa!|Nice.
{10040}{10086}Must belong to the homie|with the blue hat.
{10090}{10159}Yo!|Donnie Brasco!
{10163}{10206}Yeah?
{10210}{10291}My name is orange J.|I'm down with Massive Genius.
{10295}{10361}That's who it was.|That gangsta rapper.
{10365}{10411}I told you to shut up.
{10415}{10459}We're having a party|at G's crib.
{10463}{10535}Englewood cliffs.|You interested?
{10545}{10605}And I get served with|black-eyed peas tomorrow?
{10617}{10699}I know what time it is. Massive's|heard of the fuckin' crew you with.
{10703}{10763}There's business|to be done.
{11678}{11766}This is a beautiful,|beautiful home.
{11770}{11854}Smaller than my Hamptons crib,|but that's bigger than Steven's.
{11858}{11913}That's Italian contractors,|obviously.
{11917}{11988}Look at all these|gold records!
{11992}{12080}Whoa!|What do we have here?
{12233}{12267}You like that shit?
{12328}{12375}A Christmas present|to myself.
{12413}{12472}Isn't that|a sight to behold?
{12520}{12605}I do so love a good|firearm in my hand.
{12847}{12895}You people are all right.
{12907}{12980}Godfather?|I seen that movie 200 times.
{12990}{13061}Godfather II was|definitely the shit.
{13065}{13134}The third one... a lot of people|didn't like it,
{13138}{13222}but I think it was|just misunderstood.
{13295}{13355}So what kind of business|you want to discuss?
{13600}{13643}- Mr. Herman Rabkin.|- Hesh.
{13647}{13716}I don't know him personally,|but I know his history.
{13720}{13801}In the late '50s and '60s,|he owned F-note records.
{13805}{13875}I don't know what it was called, but,|yeah, Hesh was in the music business.
{13888}{13931}Little situation here.
{13935}{13991}A distant-but-deceased|quasi-cousin on my mother's side...
{13995}{14041}little Jimmy Willis;|'50s legend...
{14045}{14101}two seminal hit records|was his legacy...
{14105}{14188}drug tragedy.|"Such a fool"...
{14195}{14265}Oh, I love that. They play it|all the time on oldies radio.
{14278}{14346}Old Herman?|He's just another in a long line...
{14350}{14418}of white motherfuckers stealing|royalties from the black man...
{14422}{14466}that made them the money|in the first place.
{14470}{14556}Jimmy's mother out in San Bernardino|who I call my aunt...
{14560}{14630}is owed that money.
{14640}{14686}Hesh is the world's|sweetest guy,
{14690}{14756}but I've heard his opinions on|givin' back pieces of Israel.
{14760}{14826}I can only imagine what he's|gonna say about this shit.
{14830}{14874}Feel free|to enjoy the food...
{14878}{14938}and any other enjoyments.
{15022}{15070}Champagne, Sir, ma'am?
{15082}{15150}Yeah.
{15222}{15301}That guy's a gangster?|I'm a gangster.
{15305}{15399}I'm an O.G. Original gangster,|not him, fuckin' lawn jockey.
{15403}{15475}And he's got the fly|Hamptons House,
{15482}{15551}Alec Baldwin comes over,|Whitney Houston...
{15555}{15650}What do I got? I sit in the fucking|pork store, for Christ sake.
{15655}{15738}But the moolies, they got it|goin' on, and they're on TV.
{15745}{15853}- They don't take no shit.|- Soprano crew, it's always|"secret this, omerta-that."
{15857}{15901}Fuckin' gets on my nerves.
{15905}{15975}Junior, with his moldy old sweaters,|and he's a fuckin' boss.
{16010}{16060}And you were just feeling|so good about yourself.
{16070}{16139}Our thing once ruled the music|business. Did you know that?
{16143}{16236}- No.|- We bankrolled acts. Blacks, everybody.
{16240}{16318}Paid the Deejays or busted heads|to get em' played on the air.
{16322}{16378}There was some great Italian|singers. Fuckin' a.
{16382}{16443}Frankie Valli.|Dion. The Rascals.
{16455}{16490}That whole Philly thing.
{16503}{16559}My dad used to talk|about those guys.
{16563}{16634}Now? Fuckin' drum machines,|some ignorant poetry,
{16638}{16722}and every fuckin' fourth-grade dropout|ditsoon is chairman of the board.
{16765}{16824}Gangsters.
{16828}{16918}Talk about paisan pride. Go Joey!|/Shot to the heart/
{16922}{16991}/and you're to blame/|/you give love/
{16995}{17072}/a bad name/|/bad name/
{17465}{17515}Oh, you're home.|Hey.
{17520}{17586}Barb Wagner called.|Remember her from the fund-raiser?
{17590}{17688}- The mayonaisses up the street?|- They invited us to a barbecue|over at their house.
{17770}{17825}All right.|Didn't think so.
{17910}{17970}Are you still|with the brochures?
{17982}{18043}Can you believe how much|it costs for a college|education for four years?
{18050}{18100}We got enough.
{18105}{18161}I know we got enough,|but how much is enough?
{18165}{18246}I mean, God forbid, what if|something should happen?
{18250}{18293}You dig up my blue suit.|You call up old man Coletti.
{18297}{18341}You tell him not to put|too much makeup on my face.
{18345}{18414}Don't joke around|about this, Tony.
{18418}{18496}You'll be taken care of. You're|always telling me the same thing.
{18500}{18546}- I'll be taken care of.|- By who?
{18550}{18616}What is with the look?
{18620}{18666}Did you just make a score?
{18670}{18749}No. I wish.
{18753}{18846}You know, Tony, it's a|multiple-choice thing with you.
{18850}{18906}I can't tell|if you're old-fashioned,
{18910}{18953}you're paranoid...
{18957}{19005}or just a fuckin' asshole.
{19082}{19130}So what do I tell the Wagners|about this barbecue?
{19143}{19199}You want to go?|Sure.
{19203}{19326}Cusamano asked me to play a|little golf with him at his club.
{19330}{19378}- Sorry.|- All right. Fine.
{19545}{19640}Prick. The maitre D' is|really on the rag tonight.
{19665}{19721}I'll talk to him.
{19725}{19781}Remember Richie Santini?|Yeah, you used to fuck him.
{19785}{19828}That really sums it up.
{19832}{19901}I knew him since we were three.|He lived next door.
{19905}{19974}Yeah, we had|our little phase.
{19978}{20046}What about him?|You've heard his band.
{20050}{20132}Defiler? I'm not into that|headbangin' shit.
{20145}{20189}You were talkin' about|the good old days.
{20193}{20249}Italians running|the music business.
{20253}{20309}And here's Richie,|this musician who you know.
{20313}{20368}They're not a hair band anymore,|and they're really good.
{20372}{20476}You said yourself how much money|there was in this thing.
{20480}{20565}You mean like, uh,|Richie Santini?
{20613}{20668}You think Massive Genius|would be interested?
{20672}{20745}It's a whole|different thing: Black.
{20757}{20814}But he's got a company.|Massive G productions.
{20818}{20890}Shit, they make movies, even.
{20925}{20981}Massive does owe me a favor.
{20985}{21053}I'm arranging a sit-down|for him with Hesh.
{21057}{21126}I was thinking about... Okay.
{21130}{21178}I know this sounds|kind of funny.
{21190}{21234}Music management.
{21238}{21281}Huh. And working here,
{21285}{21328}I have met people,|important people.
{21332}{21414}Learned people skills.|Had to deal with big egos.
{21418}{21461}Solved problems.
{21465}{21525}And with my love|of all kinds of music...
{21597}{21657}maybe Alec Baldwin would|come to our house.
{21750}{21853}/You know who we are/|/you know what we do/
{21857}{21939}/we're comin' to defile/|/defile you/
{21943}{22015}/stay out of our way/|/and don't be so gay/
{22025}{22110}/we're comin' to defile/|/defile you/
{22182}{22278}/my-y-y Lord/
{22315}{22405}- It's just an old demo.|- No. You know what?
{22428}{22500}Fuck it.|Let's set you up.
{22513}{22568}- What?|- I got money.
{22572}{22664}You're right. With how much you|listen to the radio, you'd be good.
{22668}{22784}I can't believe it!|But I get to pick what you wear.
{22788}{22860}Dress you up.|I like that.
{23232}{23293}This place has the flava.|That gelding,
{23305}{23349}name is Sidney.
{23353}{23425}So how come you never wrote|a song about him?
{23485}{23555}When you and little Jimmy|were writing partners|on all his hits,
{23568}{23649}did you write the music and him the|lyrics, or the other way around?
{23653}{23725}We, uh, we had|our own process.
{23730}{23821}So that "ooh, wacka-do,|wacka-dooley-do, I'm so blue,"
{23825}{23897}that spring from your experience,|or the little brother's?
{23910}{23966}One could write a song|about a horse.
{23970}{24026}But in order for it to be|a hit with your target audience,
{24030}{24125}he'd have to have a mounted|cop on him and ripped up the ass|with a Mac ten, no?
{24163}{24218}So you bought horses|with your royalties.
{24222}{24278}And little Jimmy's royalties,|whatever became of those?
{24282}{24339}He bought horse.
{24343}{24401}Music business back then,|we were breaking all the rules.
{24405}{24453}Makin'em, breakin'em|as we went along.
{24465}{24525}You mean rapin'|and pillagin'.
{24530}{24568}Things haven't changed|much, huh?
{24580}{24624}Were we hard-nosed?|Yeah.
{24628}{24688}But we gave a lot of kids their|start. A lot of negro youth.
{24700}{24781}Took'em out of the ghetto, kids|with talent, put'em on the stage.
{24785}{24853}Herman, ordinarily,|I'd be more than happy...
{24857}{24914}to stroll down|memory lane with you.
{24918}{24984}But it's reparations|that I seek.
{24988}{25031}Why don't we call this|what it is: A shakedown.
{25035}{25103}Your own father was a silent|partner in F-note records.
{25107}{25203}Made sure that the records|got airplay, isn't that right?
{25215}{25284}Yeah, that money built my|house on the Jersey shore.
{25288}{25331}What do you want to do,|Hesh? I'm guided by you.
{25335}{25395}- He's got to do the right|thing, that's what.|- Ohh!
{25407}{25443}Hey.|You're way our of line, kid.
{25455}{25503}Let's get some cold fucking|fizzy water on your head.
{25640}{25696}Thank you, Jen. Let's get|right to the point, huh?
{25700}{25748}What's in this for you?
{25752}{25809}If you read|Chuck D's book,
{25813}{25869}you know he advises|that reparations be made...
{25873}{25945}by the jewish studio moguls|in hollywood...
{25955}{26011}on account of the way black folks|have been portrayed in film.
{26015}{26088}Now, that's only Germane to|this argument Inasmuch...
{26100}{26181}as I feel that the grievances in|the music business are far worse.
{26185}{26251}You're talking to the wrong|white man, my friend.
{26255}{26311}My people were the white man's|nigger when yours were still...
{26315}{26365}painting their faces|and chasing zebras.
{26373}{26477}And as far as Louie B. Mayer is concerned,|what are you, fucking nuts?
{26538}{26586}My lawyers have done|a little research.
{26590}{26655}I think that the final figure|is somewhere around...
{26668}{26732}four hundred thousand dollars.
{26788}{26878}Now, a cashier's check|made to Mrs. Idella Willis...
{26882}{26930}will set|the record straight.
{26940}{26995}Or what?
{27095}{27145}What was it|that she called him?
{27155}{27201}Oh, yeah.
{27205}{27288}"That nice man,"|I think she said.
{27527}{27588}So how's your neighbor,|the one with no neck?
{27595}{27673}The Sopranos? Well, there's a new|car in the driveway every other week,
{27677}{27721}but besides that...
{27725}{27806}he gave me a gift of some|excellent Cuban cigars.
{27810}{27865}- And you accepted them?|- Mmm-hmm.
{27870}{27916}See? Eroding|the neighborhood values.
{27920}{27966}He was thanking me for referring|him to a physician,
{27970}{28014}which he's very happy with.
{28018}{28073}Really?
{28077}{28136}What does that do|to property values,
{28140}{28188}having a gangster|living next door?
{28200}{28259}Are you kidding? Safest block|in the neighborhood.
{28263}{28331}- And bein' a gangster...|what does that mean, anyway?|- Yeah, that's true.
{28335}{28407}Some of the shit I see|in the boardroom, I don't know|if i'd make a distinction.
{28420}{28478}Oh, will you please?|It's not the same thing.
{28482}{28544}Bugging? Bribes?|I don't know.
{28548}{28641}Sometimes I think the only|thing separating the American|business from the mobs...
{28645}{28680}is fuckin' whackin' somebody.
{28693}{28771}Listen to you.|Whackin'. What?
{28775}{28831}He hangs around with Tony Soprano|for 15 minutes...
{28835}{28895}and it's "fuckin'" this|and "fuckin'" that.
{28935}{28978}We were over there|for that fund-raiser.
{28982}{29043}I didn't see|any guns anywhere.
{29052}{29127}Oh, but that bar with the|Goombah Murano glass?
{29193}{29240}I like Murano glass.
{29335}{29391}Those Monte Cristo's?
{29395}{29455}What do you say?|After dinner?
{29538}{29635}/Just jaded tired and bored/
{29730}{29820}/right or wrong/|/I ain't strong/
{29832}{29936}/like I used to be/
{29940}{29986}/I want to/
{29990}{30100}/erase myself/
{30370}{30418}I know it ain't|your type of music, but...
{30430}{30500}I like any kind of music|that turns shit green.
{30538}{30606}Richie's been through a lot.|It's deep in his writing.
{30610}{30653}As a metal band,|they were fuckin' great.
{30657}{30726}But this, as far as I am concerned,|blows away matchbox 20.
{30730}{30813}- What do they all themselves?|- Used to be Defiler.
{30825}{30894}Then some personnel changes...|bass and drums.
{30898}{30957}But Richie and Vito are still|the core of the band.
{30970}{31014}Now they're called|visiting day.
{31018}{31073}/Mom and dad/
{31077}{31194}/had left me down/
{31198}{31241}/and now I want to/
{31245}{31340}/erase myself/
{31350}{31394}This is some loud shit.
{31398}{31539}/Oh, we are alone/
{31543}{31634}/yeah, yeah,/|/yeah, yeah/
{31638}{31681}Whoo!
{31685}{31825}/Take me away/|- That's Richie.
{31907}{31941}And that's Vito.|/I don't want/
{31945}{32027}/to stay/
{32075}{32165}- Fuck you!|- Sit the fuck down, you mullethead.
{32305}{32365}This isn't the right|place for them.
{32435}{32491}You suck!
{32495}{32551}You know, without|the right help from you,
{32555}{32620}visiting day could end up in the|miscellaneous "V" section.
{32720}{32816}/Don't be sad/|/it's not bad/
{32820}{32936}/nobody cares/|- You interested?
{32940}{33073}/I want to erase myself/|Yes!
{33140}{33209}That scene where Pesci sticks|the guy's head in a vise,
{33213}{33298}and then he fuckin' pops his eye out...|I mean, I thought I was gonna die.
{33418}{33465}I'll be right back,|Okay?
{33500}{33569}Excuse me.|It's this way, right?
{33573}{33620}- Yes.|- Thank you.
{34580}{34648}- I don't know.|- What?
{34652}{34746}Richie. Guy's 30,|still lives with his parents.
{34750}{34794}It's because of the accident.
{34798}{34866}Richie had third-degree burns from|trying to grill that trout...
{34870}{34926}with a downed power line.
{34930}{35025}At the same time, being electrocuted|turned his life around.
{35060}{35116}Well, you did some|ace fucking selling.
{35120}{35166}You think?
{35170}{35214}Yeah.|Thing is, though,
{35218}{35309}music is not something you can|hold in your hands, you know,
{35313}{35410}like football betting cards|or coke.
{35432}{35476}It's art.
{35480}{35573}Berry Gordy, whatever, he had|to see it in the Supremes.
{35577}{35621}It's an instinct.
{35625}{35669}I see it in Richie.
{35673}{35732}Yeah.|Probably is.
{35770}{35814}I'm really fuckin' doin' it!
{35818}{35877}And it's all thanks to you.
{35913}{35969}I got to make a demo CD,|like Massive advised,
{35973}{36019}and then... yeah!
{36023}{36073}My wife thinks I need|to meet new people.
{36080}{36143}- So?|- Come on. You're Italian.|You understand.
{36148}{36235}Guys like me, we're brought up to|think the Meddigan are fuckin' bores.
{36248}{36316}The truth is, the average white|man is no more boring...
{36320}{36436}than the millionth conversation over|who should have won, Marciano or Ali.
{36440}{36496}So am I to understand that you|don't consider yourself white?
{36500}{36544}I don't mean white,|like caucasian.
{36548}{36651}I mean a white man,|like our friend, Cusamano.
{36655}{36715}Now, he's Italian,|but he's a Meddigan.
{36727}{36775}He's what my old man woulda|called the wonder bread wop.
{36788}{36831}Eats his Sunday gravy|out of a jar.
{36835}{36903}You seem to want|to branch out.
{36907}{36988}- What's stopping you?|- The guys.
{37025}{37110}What they'd think if I started|hanging out with the Meddigan.
{37340}{37448}I was in your neighborhood|last night, at the Cusamano's.
{37530}{37602}- Oh, yeah?|- Dinner party.
{37663}{37706}Shoulda stopped by.
{37710}{37770}Live right next door.
{37943}{38038}You didn't hear any strange noises|last night in your neighborhood?
{38075}{38119}Noises?
{38123}{38182}Like someone|screaming in pain?
{38218}{38277}Uh, no.
{38290}{38350}Probably a television set.
{38457}{38530}- You saw my house?|- Mm-hmm.
{38770}{38830}Oh!|This looks good.
{38875}{38944}Mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm. That sausage,|huh, where'd you get it?
{38948}{39039}- Little place in Garfield?|- Honey, where'd we get the sausage?
{39043}{39086}That little place in Garfield.|You know,
{39090}{39140}the only thing better than a|little sausage is a pair of tits.
{39150}{39219}I don't know about that, but|it's a hell of a piece of meat.
{39223}{39291}Sausage is kind of|a phallic thing.
{39295}{39343}Whereas tits...
{39425}{39503}- So, Jack, you're a stockbroker, right?|- Mmm.
{39507}{39566}Any changes|in the market comin'?
{39570}{39635}They're always changing.|That's what keeps us coming back.
{39695}{39761}Oh, by the way, Rand, you hear|from Ross on Dexplex?
{39765}{39838}No, not yet, but the buyout is|definitely goin' down.
{39845}{39889}Just give me a little warning.|I need to call the Islands.
{39893}{39957}Dexplex?
{40088}{40146}Oh, it's a little company.|It's going public, maybe.
{40150}{40209}Hey, hey. Come on.|Come on, will ya?
{40213}{40256}The sun is shining.|It's a beautiful day.
{40260}{40316}Let's not talk business|for once, huh?
{40320}{40380}American Biotics.
{40385}{40428}Barb, our stock Guru.
{40432}{40494}She thinks American Biotics|may be a good investment.
{40498}{40591}It's supposed to be close to a side-|- effect-free anti-impotence drug.
{40595}{40665}- You guys play the stock market?|- We don't just play.
{40690}{40750}We win.
{40940}{40996}/Friends say I'm crazy/
{41000}{41066}/she's gonna make me cry/
{41070}{41126}/but none of them know/|/the way we/
{41130}{41202}/steal a little kiss/|/and my, oh, my/
{41215}{41259}/fools follow angels/
{41263}{41341}/wanna believe she's mine/|/all mine alone/
{41345}{41427}/why am I such a fool/
{41735}{41782}/friends say I'm crazy/
{41795}{41861}/she's gonna make me cry/
{41865}{41925}/but none of them know/|/the way we/
{41932}{42009}/steal a little kiss/|/and, oh, my/
{42013}{42056}/fools follow angels/
{42060}{42132}/wanna believe she's mine/|/all mine alone/
{42143}{42225}/why am I such a fool/
{42238}{42323}/erase myself/
{42382}{42465}/are we alone/
{42525}{42623}/yeah, yeah/
{42682}{42832}/take me away/
{42900}{42990}/I don't want to stay/
{43100}{43135}/there must be/
{43148}{43255}/another way/
{43568}{43643}That's take 62.
{43648}{43718}We oughta just bag it.
{43898}{43941}Okay. We're baggin' it.
{43945}{44014}We shoulda bagged this two days|ago when it was fucking perfect.
{44018}{44090}I wish I had thought of that.
{44157}{44226}It's good.|You know, not bad.
{44230}{44273}I think it's as good as|we're gonna get right now.
{44277}{44346}Oh, it wasn't too bad.|It was kind of good.
{44350}{44406}Hey.
{44410}{44478}Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you saying?|Is something wrong?
{44482}{44526}No, I'm sure we're all|trying our best here.
{44530}{44586}I just think|we hit a brick wall.
{44590}{44659}Maybe some rest.
{44663}{44706}Hey, hey, fuck that!
{44710}{44766}I paid for three days'|studio time already.
{44770}{44851}It's only gonna cost me more money to|pack it up and come in again, isn't it?
{44855}{44941}I don't get it. We got through the|instrumental tracks with no problem.
{44945}{45005}Ah, I'm fuckin' beat.
{45013}{45096}What do you say we finish|this shit? Three days now|we been slammin' our hams.
{45100}{45173}Look, Kinkos gave me five days off.|It's not the end of the world.
{45177}{45259}Kinko's? Buddy, this is|costing me 300 bucks an hour.
{45263}{45310}Here. Try this.
{45382}{45477}Dude, I don't do drugs|anymore, okay?
{45490}{45550}Well, hats off. But for all the|dynamic excitement in these songs,
{45563}{45623}maybe we should get another downed|power line in here, let you suck on it.
{45635}{45680}- Christopher!|- What you just heard...
{45690}{45727}was our balls-out,|most introspective song.
{45740}{45806}- It's not supposed to rock.|- It'll be our first single.
{45810}{45885}No, dude, second. "Sharon's chair"|will be the one that busts out.
{45898}{45948}I like "Melt".
{45952}{46005}Come on. Go shoot the crank,|let's wrap this up, all right?
{46030}{46098}- What?|- You heard me. Spike up.
{46102}{46213}- No fucking way.|- Christopher,|I'm producing these sessions.
{46223}{46282}Go take the fucking drugs.|I'm not fucking around anymore.
{46290}{46327}Look, the problem,|Christopher,
{46340}{46384}is that the bass|and the drum tracks...
{46388}{46436}were miked wrong from|the fucking beginning.
{46440}{46521}Whoa, hey, king of rock,|you're out of your depth.
{46525}{46569}Look, let me tell you|something, dude.
{46573}{46653}Thank you, but I've|recorded in Denmark.
{46657}{46726}Okay. You want to know|what the problem is?
{46730}{46813}Where are|the fucking choruses?
{46825}{46894}All your songs,|you got no choruses.
{46898}{46945}Your choruses are basically|just another verse.
{46957}{47007}I mean, what happened to|"She loves you", huh?
{47020}{47081}- "She loves you"?|- Yeah, the song. Started with the chorus.
{47085}{47166}There is structure.|That's how you build a song.
{47170}{47214}The beatles, the beatles,|the beatles.
{47218}{47298}Look, that's been 40 fucking|years now. It makes me sick.
{47302}{47366}- What is he, nuts?|- Fuck this, man.
{47370}{47416}Where are you goin'?
{47420}{47498}I'm goin' to A.A.,|you fuckin' jerk-off.

{48218}{48276}I can't believe you.|Yeah, yeah.
{48280}{48323}Five thousand shares.
{48327}{48396}American Biotics.
{48400}{48460}Can you place|the order today?
{48495}{48576}Okay, great. I'll have|the money to you by tomorrow.
{48580}{48648}Okay.|Thank you.
{48652}{48727}Bye bye.
{48775}{48866}- Are you spying on people now?|- I live here.
{48870}{48927}Are you playing|wall street now.
{48952}{49025}Women are better savers than|men, and we are nurturers.
{49035}{49103}What do you know|about the stock market?
{49107}{49151}I keep my ears open.
{49155}{49215}CNBC is a very|interesting channel.
{49280}{49340}Listen, your father, God bless him,|he does very well.
{49350}{49396}But who knows, you know?
{49400}{49444}What if something|unforeseen should happen.
{49448}{49520}- What if he gets hit by a truck.|- I mean, then what?
{49530}{49580}I got you kids to think about.|I don't know, mom.
{49590}{49646}Well, when you get|married, you will know.
{49650}{49696}A woman's got to keep|her sense of individuality.
{49700}{49748}This here is a life lesson.
{49880}{49950}Okay. Let's go to|Georgette Klinger's.

{50485}{50532}I gotta tell ya, this is a|nice place. Didn't I tell ya?
{50545}{50589}We oughta see about|making you a member.
{50593}{50648}Tony, you ever play|that place in Orlando?
{50652}{50696}No, I never get down there.
{50700}{50756}Well, Disney World.
{50760}{50857}You know, Al's place.|Mount Plymouth?
{50870}{50936}- Al Capone built it.|- No shit?
{50940}{51000}Capone was a golf fanatic.|That's right.
{51013}{51069}So you guys watch A&E.
{51073}{51136}Tony, uh, let me|ask you a question.
{51140}{51235}If I'm stepping on any toes, tell me.|How real was the Godfather?
{51345}{51391}I mean,|in your opinion.
{51395}{51465}What do you mean, real?|Authentic or not.
{51502}{51585}I don't know.|How would I know?
{51610}{51679}It was the '50s, right.|No, it was 1972.
{51683}{51751}What he means is the story|took place in the '50s.
{51755}{51830}I wanna know if you really had to|cut your finger and take an oath.
{52025}{52081}Like gridlock on times square on|this golf course today, isn't it?
{52085}{52176}This traffic in Manhattan's gotten|worse since "don't block the box".
{52180}{52236}- You got a lot of friends in NY, Tony?|- Yeah.
{52240}{52300}You ever go down|to little Italy?
{52313}{52395}- You know, San Gennaro,|the feast, with the kids.|- Tell the truth.
{52400}{52444}What's the first thing you think of|when you hear "Mulberry Street"?
{52448}{52491}Umberto's.
{52495}{52550}Hey, did you ever see...
{52560}{52606}that picture|of Gallante dead...
{52610}{52661}with a cigar hangin'|out of his mouth?
{52665}{52730}- No.|- It's a fuckin' beautiful hit, huh?
{52808}{52851}Sorry, Tony.
{52855}{52921}You probably knew the guy, huh?
{52925}{53016}- How old you think I am?|- You don't have to answer this|if you don't want to,
{53020}{53063}but I gotta know.
{53067}{53140}Did you ever meet John Gotti?
{53248}{53316}Yeah.|I knew John.
{53320}{53386}Whoa! Fuck!
{53390}{53438}What was he really like?
{53560}{53616}- Remember bungalow bar?|- The ice cream trucks?
{53620}{53738}Like good humor, except the|trucks had bungalow roofs on'em.
{53742}{53802}Was Gotti a silent partner|in all that thing?
{53813}{53860}I don't know nothin'|about that.
{53873}{53929}Just know that|when the company folded...
{53933}{54006}and they were auctioning off|the last bungalow bar truck,
{54010}{54091}the one with the peaked roofs...|you're right, cooze...
{54095}{54148}cooze.
{54173}{54241}Well, they're auctioning off|the last bungalow bar truck...
{54245}{54305}and I wanted it|as a souvenir.
{54327}{54383}Gotti outbid me.
{54465}{54515}Gave me a ride home.
{54598}{54654}You know,|he rang that bell...
{54658}{54717}the whole way home?
{54967}{55063}Oh! They're wavin' at us.

{55513}{55613}/my inner child/
{55650}{55696}/I should hope/|Yeah, this is good.
{55700}{55805}/He ain't been defiled/
{55842}{55898}/I am just/

{56070}{56200}Yeah.|/Is an empty hole/
{56370}{56442}/meow/
{56455}{56563}/meow/
{56855}{56901}So?
{56905}{56965}I think it's, uh, not good.
{56990}{57041}Want to be a little|more specific?
{57045}{57095}There's good and there's|not good. This is not good.
{57105}{57155}Okay, maybe it's not your era.|No offense.
{57165}{57221}Music is music.|Talent is talent.
{57225}{57294}I don't care who you are.|And I've seen them all.
{57298}{57396}I saw heavy metal invented|by Hendrix at the Cafe Wha.|Kid just came out of the army.
{57400}{57456}I said to him, "Kid, I don't|know what you call it...
{57460}{57516}talent, charisma, magic...|but you've got it".
{57520}{57594}These kids, they don't.|Sorry.
{57598}{57656}You're just pissed that I went|against you at the sit-down.
{57660}{57731}Get the fuck out of here|and stop wasting my time.
{57735}{57808}This Vito is a great|fucking guitar player, Hesh.
{57820}{57863}Fine. Great.|He's a great guitar player.
{57867}{57936}However, there's one constant in the|music business... a hit is a hit.
{57940}{58009}- And this, my friend, is not a hit.|- Why?
{58013}{58113}Christ. For reasons we couldn't comprehend|or codify, you pathetic schlepper.
{58117}{58221}Fuckin' Massive is a genius, so what|the fuck was he talkin' about?
{58225}{58273}I remember when I was a kid, there|was this guy in my neighborhood.
{58285}{58320}We used to call him|Jimmy Smash.
{58333}{58401}He wasn't retarded,
{58405}{58440}but we thought he was because|he had one of these, uh,
{58477}{58534}whatchamacallits.
{58538}{58594}Hey, how the fuck|are ya?
{58598}{58651}What do you call that?|Cleft Palate.
{58655}{58710}Yeah.
{58735}{58779}Well, we was kids, right?
{58783}{58855}So what the hell do we know?
{58867}{58950}Every time he opened his mouth,|we'd piss ourselves laughin'.
{58955}{59015}But Jimmy didn't mind, because|he got to hang out with us.
{59023}{59091}Popular crew.
{59095}{59141}Although we only called him|when we were bored.
{59145}{59205}Called him, said, "hey, Jimmy.
{59217}{59255}Sing "Mack the knife". "
{59265}{59315}And because he wanted to hang out|with us, he'd belt it right out.
{59375}{59442}We'd fuckin' roll|on the floor laughing.
{59515}{59584}And then, you know,|when the laughs got old,
{59588}{59635}We stopped callin' him.
{59683}{59786}Wasn't till years later that|I found out the poor prick|was goin' home every night...
{59790}{59858}and cryin' himself to sleep.
{59980}{60036}When I found out, you know, I...
{60040}{60088}I felt bad.
{60160}{60204}But I never really understood...
{60208}{60245}what he felt.
{60255}{60301}To be used, you know,
{60305}{60388}for somebody else's amusement|like a fuckin' dancin' bear...
{60413}{60485}till I played golf|with those guys.
{60545}{60610}Well, you thought|Cusamano was your friend.
{60645}{60695}You live, you learn.
{60810}{60865}Do you mind if I|ask you a question?
{60920}{60996}- Whatever happened to Jimmy?|- Jimmy Smash?
{61000}{61073}He's doin' 20 for robbery.
{61085}{61129}Wasn't too hard for the cops|to figure out who it was.
{61133}{61176}He goes up to the bank teller|with a mask, he goes,
{61180}{61227}"Give me your money."
{61458}{61517}Some fucker's|on the phone for you.
{61638}{61716}Good morning, Herman.|I'm listening. Good.
{61720}{61792}I wouldn't want you to miss|anything I have to say.|I've been thinking about it.
{61805}{61894}- Go on.|- You'll have to find another|schmuck to have a moment with.
{61898}{61931}You do know|what this means, Herman.
{61935}{62005}Stupid enough to say it|over the phone, let's hear it.
{62017}{62061}I don't threaten, Herman.|I act.
{62065}{62141}Genius, you're getting yourself|in way over your head here.
{62145}{62201}Why don't you think about|backin' up a little bit?
{62205}{62256}You know,|let sleepin' dogs lie.
{62260}{62298}Hey, Soprano.
{62310}{62371}Let me share with you what I suspect|about this gangsta rap shit.
{62375}{62448}I think you probably got a degree|in sociology from the city college.
{62455}{62523}I grew up in the projects.|Delta 13.
{62527}{62596}Killed a man.
{62600}{62644}Later on,|I got a degree.
{62648}{62729}But urban planning.|You were close.
{62733}{62792}Now, when it comes to|which is mightier,
{62805}{62861}the pen or the|motherfucking sword,
{62865}{62909}I let the situation|dictate.
{62913}{62995}- Don't press it.|- I'm gonna do my part...
{63008}{63051}to keep Mr. Rabkin's|people working.
{63055}{63163}- What's that supposed to mean?|- Expect to hear from|Goldstein, Baum and Woronov.
{63167}{63231}They'll be representing|miss willis in the lawsuit.
{63235}{63334}- You gonna sue?|- With what I pay in retainers,|fuck, yeah.
{63338}{63398}I hear that. Yeah, well.
{63405}{63440}Listen, be advised...
{63452}{63496}that on your artist|scratch's last single,
{63500}{63548}you sampled|a backing vocal...
{63560}{63629}from the chablis'|1968 song, "Riff with it",
{63633}{63711}for which F-note records controls|the master recording rights.
{63715}{63775}- No shit?|- Yeah, shit.
{63780}{63836}I would of course|have to counter sue.
{63840}{63900}I'll see you in court.
{63923}{63983}Fuckin' legal fees.
{64008}{64045}What kind of moolies|are these?
{64058}{64101}They call themselves gangsters.
{64105}{64159}It's a new fuckin' day.
{64163}{64223}Fuckin' depressing.
{64233}{64292}Okay. Now this|is a Donatella Versace.
{64305}{64388}- Nice.|- You like it better than the Alaia?
{64530}{64615}- Keep'em both.|- Christopher, $2400!
{64652}{64748}- I don't think you really like it.|- I like it. I like it.
{64927}{65013}Huh?|MTV awards?
{65120}{65216}- What?|- Nothing.
{65220}{65280}I thought we put|that fight behind us.
{65290}{65340}You want me to take all this back,|I will. No problem.
{65350}{65410}No. Fuck,|I want you to have it.
{65795}{65863}You know how I use the technique|of positive visualization?
{65867}{65911}I know you talk about it.
{65915}{65959}You're fairly negative|a lot of the time.
{65963}{66030}Well, I think you should|mentally prepare...
{66040}{66125}for the fuckin' possibility|that visiting day sucks.
{66198}{66266}- What?|- I think the only reason you've|gotten this far with Massive...
{66270}{66335}...is he wants to be in your pants.
{66370}{66426}Boy, oh, boy.
{66430}{66480}I let some experts|listen to the demo.
{66490}{66527}- They shit all over it.|- I'm sorry.
{66540}{66584}Experts?|Who, Hesh?
{66588}{66656}- That old fucking synagogue Cantor?|- Silvio.
{66660}{66704}He owned rock clubs in Asbury.
{66708}{66776}You heard what squid said.|He's a professional engineer.
{66780}{66823}What about my opinion?
{66827}{66888}That it's good,|that it's special?
{67042}{67155}His eyes are on your ass, Adriana,|98% of the time. You know that.
{67190}{67234}This is just a way|for you to keep me down.
{67238}{67310}- Aw, that ain't fair.|- I don't want these clothes.
{67455}{67534}What's wrong with it, huh?|What's wrong with visiting day?
{67538}{67619}I don't know, but it's a|problem that you don't know.
{67623}{67666}Richie, he'll sing anything.
{67670}{67738}You just don't want to believe that I|could have a relationship with a man...
{67742}{67811}like Massive that wasn't|based on fucking.
{67815}{67859}That was based on intelligence,
{67863}{67906}respect, talent.
{67910}{67958}I'll shut up.
{68055}{68115}You sayin'|I don't have talent?
{68198}{68254}I've branched out,|made new friends, new horizons,
{68258}{68305}and you can't stand that.
{68365}{68411}Yeah.
{68415}{68459}Go silent. That's you.
{68463}{68523}Either screaming your head off|or fucking dead.
{68570}{68630}I don't think I can|stay here anymore.
{68800}{68873}I love you.|That is such a lie.
{69075}{69121}Hey, Carmela!
{69125}{69185}In here.
{69317}{69365}I need a finger.
{69400}{69456}- What's in the box?|- Sand.
{69460}{69541}- I'm fuckin' with Cusamano.|- Tony...

{69640}{69690}You're awfully chipper today.
{69700}{69734}So what are you|gonna do with the box?
{69738}{69841}Give it to him. Tell him to...|"Hold on to it for awhile".
{69845}{69913}Oh, Tony!|That is so evil!
{69917}{69965}Yeah, I know.|That's why it's so much fun.

{71073}{71145}I need you to hang on|to this for a while for me.
{71180}{71223}Hang onto it a little while.|I'll come get it when I need it.
{71227}{71344}- How long?|- A month, you know.|Maybe more, maybe less.
{71348}{71408}- Okay? Thanks.|- Yeah, sure.
{71445}{71523}Oh, the club. I meant to ask you|about the club. What's going on?
{71527}{71588}Oh, the club.

{71648}{71695}Membership's closed.
{71708}{71763}- Closed?|- Yeah.
{71767}{71840}No new members|until old members die.
{71852}{71900}Nobody's dyin'?
{71913}{71956}Nothin' anybody|could do anything about.
{71960}{72016}- No biggie, Cooze. Thanks.|- You sure?
{72020}{72076}I mean, because... now.
{72080}{72140}I'll live.
{73030}{73123}/And all temptations/|/I resist/
{73127}{73200}/and nothing can compare to this/
{73205}{73309}/oh, nobody loves me/
{73313}{73398}/nobody loves me but you/
{73402}{73471}/and for that/|/I'd love to find/
{73475}{73595}/I'd give it all away/|/in gratitude/
{73667}{73715}Now, uh,|that's a hit.
{73775}{73873}/And all temptations/|/I resist/
{73877}{73925}/nothing can compare/
{74017}{74061}What is it?|Heroin?
{74065}{74111}Shit, Jean, I don't know.
{74115}{74163}- A weapon?|- I don't know.
{74198}{74254}Could be anything.
{74258}{74305}Uh, uh!
{74317}{74355}Don't touch it.

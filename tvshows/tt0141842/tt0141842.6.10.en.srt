2
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:55,647
Tony, hey.
I tented the bulbs.

3
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:58,108
Oh, good.

4
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:01,403
I've been meaning
to ask you...

5
00:02:01,404 --> 00:02:03,280
The Sacrimonis...

6
00:02:03,281 --> 00:02:06,492
I've been doin' his yard
over there a year and change now...

7
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,035
And?

8
00:02:08,036 --> 00:02:09,703
I guess
what I'm asking is

9
00:02:09,704 --> 00:02:13,732
how much longer do I have
to keep doin' this on the arm?

10
00:02:14,584 --> 00:02:16,585
Oh, so it was okay
when we were gettin' you

11
00:02:16,586 --> 00:02:18,420
out of your Feech La Manna problem, huh?

12
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:20,297
But suddenly...
short fuckin' memory?

13
00:02:20,298 --> 00:02:22,549
I appreciate that, Tony.
Don't get me wrong, but...

14
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,676
You're a selfish prick, Sal.
You know that?

15
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:27,304
Her husband's in jail.
Don't you think this is the time

16
00:02:27,305 --> 00:02:29,956
when Mrs. Sacrimoni
needs you the most?

17
00:02:37,732 --> 00:02:40,025
The federal prosecutors
and myself have been told

18
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,152
to clear our calendars
for the next five months.

19
00:02:42,153 --> 00:02:44,279
So trial is upon us.

20
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,448
And the feds have reached

21
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:48,767
a complete accounting
of your worth.

22
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:54,498
"The vintage Wurlitzer"?

23
00:02:54,499 --> 00:02:56,458
They go through
my fuckin' sock drawer?

24
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,460
They shot a video
the day of your arrest.

25
00:02:58,461 --> 00:03:00,462
They even tracked down
the 180 grand

26
00:03:00,463 --> 00:03:02,881
in Boca Raton
under your father's name.

27
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,492
They estimate
your net worth at $5 million...

28
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,720
While Ginny lives
on scraps.

29
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,722
...between your cash
and portfolios

30
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:12,432
with Fidelity and Vanguard,

31
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:16,186
your 401k and severance parachute
from Essany Scaffolding,

32
00:03:16,187 --> 00:03:18,730
condo in Deal Beach
at 450,

33
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,732
Maserati, Ginny's Yukon,

34
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,402
and the house and its contents
valued at a million two.

35
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:26,071
Is this all part
of your plan, Ron...

36
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:29,158
make me so fuckin' depressed
that I hang myself?

37
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:33,311
It's my obligation to raise the idea
again of cooperating.

38
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,290
Flip?

39
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:39,251
Let me explain something
to you again, Ron,

40
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,211
but differently.

41
00:03:41,212 --> 00:03:44,173
Being a rat,
where I'm comin' from,

42
00:03:44,174 --> 00:03:46,675
that's like asking a person
where you're comin' from

43
00:03:46,676 --> 00:03:48,886
to become a fuckin' Nazi.

44
00:03:48,887 --> 00:03:52,222
I don't wanna hear
that shit again.

45
00:03:52,223 --> 00:03:54,057
Good.

46
00:03:54,058 --> 00:03:56,710
Because, frankly,
I don't represent turncoats.

47
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:02,507
'Cause it would kill
your practice.

48
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,185
Huh...

49
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,374
What happened
to my stuffed pork loin?

50
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,585
You ever hear
of knocking?

51
00:04:21,586 --> 00:04:23,253
I ordered it special.

52
00:04:23,254 --> 00:04:26,340
You had them send it up
to Carmela?

53
00:04:26,341 --> 00:04:28,634
You get
what you pay for.

54
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:31,244
Hi.

55
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:36,391
She's your little twin.

56
00:04:36,392 --> 00:04:38,477
Bacala's got
no fuckin' genes at all.

57
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,813
You never miss a chance
to shit on him, do you?

58
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:44,566
I'm joking, come on.
She looks like you, that's all.

59
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:46,318
I don't know why you
just can't admit

60
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,762
that you blame us
that you got shot.

61
00:04:52,283 --> 00:04:54,868
Unfortunately, I have
only myself to blame.

62
00:04:54,869 --> 00:04:56,995
"Unfortunately." Oh.

63
00:04:56,996 --> 00:05:00,815
So obviously you'd like
to blame somebody.

64
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:04,002
I have only myself
to blame.

65
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:06,129
You don't blame me
for the shooting?

66
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,048
Well you fuckin'
blame me for something!

67
00:05:08,049 --> 00:05:11,009
- Jan, the baby.
- You know, marrying the boss's sister...

68
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,470
usually it's a step up.

69
00:05:13,471 --> 00:05:17,099
But you keep your
goddamn foot on our necks.

70
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,851
You punish Bobby
because he's my husband.

71
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:23,981
- Will you stop, huh?
- To be his age and not to be a captain?

72
00:05:23,982 --> 00:05:27,067
Oh, now I see what this
little visit's all about.

73
00:05:27,068 --> 00:05:28,986
He works so hard
for you,

74
00:05:28,987 --> 00:05:30,737
and what does he get?

75
00:05:30,738 --> 00:05:32,614
Merciless ridicule...

76
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:35,033
about his weight,
about his model railroading.

77
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:38,036
- He's a grown man!
- Oh, but it's okay for Neil Young.

78
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:40,105
He owns Lionel!

79
00:05:41,582 --> 00:05:45,318
Domenica! Take care
of your things.

80
00:05:46,504 --> 00:05:48,964
I don't know
where it comes from...

81
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:52,592
all your anger,
your hate for me.

82
00:05:52,593 --> 00:05:55,161
I'm your sister.

83
00:05:56,306 --> 00:05:59,308
I know
I'm not perfect.

84
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:01,960
I know
I annoy people.

85
00:06:04,022 --> 00:06:06,565
I think about you

86
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,675
lying in that
hospital bed...

87
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:13,071
I cried for you.

88
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:15,181
I sat with you.

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,817
I know it.

90
00:06:27,503 --> 00:06:30,155
And I appreciated it.

91
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,927
But we both know

92
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:39,639
no matter
how much help I gave,

93
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,726
you'd still be here
fuckin' complainin'.

94
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:44,461
Oh my God,

95
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:48,923
there's nothing holding us together
but DNA.

96
00:07:01,746 --> 00:07:04,689
I'm askin' what else you got
besides slot machines?

97
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:09,920
That single-deck
blackjack?

98
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:12,280
Okay, thanks.

99
00:07:24,894 --> 00:07:26,728
I can't believe this.

100
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:29,106
- I was...
- Is this what you're doing all day?

101
00:07:29,107 --> 00:07:32,150
I knew there was a reason you wouldn't
let me read the galleys of your book.

102
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:33,693
I'm doing research.

103
00:07:33,694 --> 00:07:36,029
I guess Rocky Marciano
was a fan of the greyhounds

104
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,307
'cause I found a fucking
trifecta box ticket in my trash!

105
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:45,622
Hold up.

106
00:07:45,623 --> 00:07:48,208
It's complicated shit.

107
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:50,377
Are you even
a sportswriter?

108
00:07:50,378 --> 00:07:53,839
I mean, here we are talking about taking
the next step in this relationship.

109
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,801
I ask you to share my home and you
can't even be straight with me.

110
00:07:57,802 --> 00:08:00,512
Fuck this.
Nice knowing you, Vincent.

111
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,872
Jimbo, come on.

112
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,897
I'm not
a writer, okay?

113
00:08:10,898 --> 00:08:13,942
I'm not
from Scottsdale

114
00:08:13,943 --> 00:08:17,070
and the car's
not my sister's.

115
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:19,156
I'm actually
from New Jersey

116
00:08:19,157 --> 00:08:21,324
- I knew it.
- Some shit went down.

117
00:08:21,325 --> 00:08:23,201
I had to leave...

118
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:26,604
my home,
my contracting business...

119
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,374
my wife, my kids.

120
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,085
Are you drunk?
It's not even 11:00!

121
00:08:32,086 --> 00:08:34,087
You think it's easy?

122
00:08:34,088 --> 00:08:36,214
I miss home so bad
my heart's a fuckin' lump.

123
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,216
I'm barely holding
together,

124
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,385
stuck in the sticks,
running out of money

125
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,387
and now this?

126
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:45,039
You think I was
looking for you?

127
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:49,227
A wife and kids.
Of course.

128
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,062
I've been divorced
for a few years.

129
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,856
Where do they think
you are?

130
00:08:52,857 --> 00:08:56,902
You can never
tell anybody, ever.

131
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,946
I'm not
fuckin' around here.

132
00:08:59,947 --> 00:09:02,240
I was married too,
remember?

133
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:06,203
I was only gonna say
you need some money,

134
00:09:06,204 --> 00:09:09,915
you worked construction...
maybe I can help you get work.

135
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,942
I know some people could always
use a good handyman.

136
00:09:18,382 --> 00:09:21,218
Happy birthday!

137
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:23,720
- Mwah!
- Stop blubbering. It's a party.

138
00:09:23,721 --> 00:09:27,098
You think we'd let you
turn 50 alone?

139
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,375
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

140
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,547
Hi, Sal!

141
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,276
God, he's such a mope.

142
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,779
The girls come around
enough, and that helps.

143
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,823
Allegra's a little bitchy,
but it's painful for her to be here.

144
00:09:43,824 --> 00:09:46,076
Plus she thinks
I resent her happiness.

145
00:09:46,077 --> 00:09:48,119
- Newlyweds.
- She's probably freaked out

146
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,704
that she's not
happier herself.

147
00:09:49,705 --> 00:09:53,416
Ginny, that kitchen...

148
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:55,126
and this room,
the light...

149
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:57,087
Not his decision
to make.

150
00:09:57,088 --> 00:09:58,672
I'm running that shop,
not him.

151
00:09:58,673 --> 00:10:01,132
My days are
completely full.

152
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,409
- I shouldn't.
- Hey, it's your birthday.

153
00:10:06,347 --> 00:10:09,099
- Yeah.
- I've always loved this place.

154
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,851
It reminds me
of the Palladian villas I saw in Italy.

155
00:10:11,852 --> 00:10:13,979
Thank you.
Sometimes I forget.

156
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,648
And it's embarrassing.
I spend most of my time upstairs.

157
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,150
- Wellbutrin.
- I wish there was a pill...

158
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:20,652
John in that place?

159
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,029
Of course I can't say
my pain's worse than anybody's.

160
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:26,032
Yeah, yeah.
We're both grownups.

161
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:29,060
I'd rather go
with my own instincts.

162
00:10:50,308 --> 00:10:54,019
Your feet are like
fuckin' icicles.

163
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,837
Hands too?

164
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,025
Dinner was good.

165
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,010
Shh.

166
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:28,637
Hey, I found
a woodland mountain.

167
00:11:28,638 --> 00:11:33,374
27" peak,
clump foliage and snow.

168
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,795
- Bobby.
- I'm listening, okay?

169
00:11:38,606 --> 00:11:40,565
Where are you going?

170
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:43,735
Rafe's brother's making a music video.
They got dry ice.

171
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:46,137
Where's your helmet?

172
00:11:47,531 --> 00:11:49,807
Check out
the Moe and Joe action.

173
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:55,246
Hey, you know what?
Let's do a race,

174
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,207
the Polar Express one.

175
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,150
We could trash it.

176
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:02,987
I can't.

177
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:17,001
I see the gray cloud
hanging around your head.

178
00:12:18,354 --> 00:12:21,189
Where's Prince Albert?
Still sleeping?

179
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,424
Who knows?

180
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:30,615
Tony, I've been very patient with you
because you've been sick.

181
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:34,452
You were going to talk
to the building inspector.

182
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:37,789
- My spec house.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

183
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,333
I sent Little Paulie.

184
00:12:40,334 --> 00:12:43,169
They made some headway
with the supervisor,

185
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:47,132
but the other guy,
the inspector, he's a piece of work.

186
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,367
Next I'll get Sil
on it.

187
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:56,124
Gotta pay a visit to the Montville
building department.

188
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,935
To what end?

189
00:12:58,936 --> 00:13:01,980
I've been promising Carm
I'd lean on this inspector.

190
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,983
Completely went
out of my head.

191
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:09,095
The guy's name is,
uh, Ron Senkowski.

192
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,725
Ginny Sack's brother,
Anthony.

193
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,332
Ah, the lord
of the lenses.

194
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,210
Actually we just started
carrying these.

195
00:13:24,211 --> 00:13:27,446
The newest
Cross pen.

196
00:13:33,596 --> 00:13:36,014
Ah...

197
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,682
a rollerball.

198
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,184
You want
a classic fountain?

199
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:42,420
Nah.
Have a seat.

200
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:45,690
So how's your
brother-in-law?

201
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,842
John's fuckin'
made of steel.

202
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:54,365
I was told
"your ears only."

203
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,367
Oh, that's why
he didn't get a pen?

204
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:59,228
- No, I...
- He's fuckin' with you, Anthony.

205
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:11,216
Johnny's a silent partner

206
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,718
in this heavy equipment
leasing thing in New Orleans.

207
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:18,389
Good. FEMA's down there
handing out Krugerrands in buckets.

208
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,226
He said post-Katrina you had some
knowledge of business in the area.

209
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,394
Well, let me say this...

210
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:27,048
Dick Cheney for President...
of the fuckin' universe.

211
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:32,904
On account of John's, uh,
liquidity problems...

212
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,572
the asset freeze...

213
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,741
he'd love you
to contact these brothers...

214
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,410
the owners...
and turn it into cash.

215
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:40,787
Me?

216
00:14:40,788 --> 00:14:42,813
Says Phil Leotardo
shouldn't be involved.

217
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,877
Just know John's
asking as a friend.

218
00:14:47,878 --> 00:14:50,321
And obviously
there's a finder's fee.

219
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:22,620
What the hell's this,
a siesta?

220
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,915
What?
I wasn't sleeping.

221
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,668
I was resting my hips.

222
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:31,779
I'm supposed
to have surgery.

223
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,342
Am I early?

224
00:15:36,343 --> 00:15:39,846
- What do you mean?
- Dinner.

225
00:15:39,847 --> 00:15:43,725
I am interviewing
a new contractor for my spec...

226
00:15:43,726 --> 00:15:46,144
Bill DeGillio.

227
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,146
He built
the Sacrimoni house.

228
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:51,649
He did decent workmanship.
Ginny says he works for a price.

229
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,444
- So?
- Well, your sister loves that house.

230
00:15:54,445 --> 00:15:57,430
She said it reminded her
of a "villa in Italy."

231
00:15:58,532 --> 00:16:00,074
What, is he
coming here now?

232
00:16:00,075 --> 00:16:03,060
I picked up a couple of sandwiches
from Italianissimo.

233
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:16,007
You know, your father
did this house

234
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:19,327
and it was more than
decent workmanship.

235
00:16:25,601 --> 00:16:28,061
You think about replacing
him before you rush off

236
00:16:28,062 --> 00:16:31,422
into something that could maybe cost
you a lot more of your time.

237
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,260
Why do you suddenly care
so much about my dad?

238
00:16:43,494 --> 00:16:46,579
And I like that she has
these little projects

239
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,916
and charities,
what-have-you.

240
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:51,751
Makes her happy,

241
00:16:51,752 --> 00:16:54,170
keeps her busy.

242
00:16:54,171 --> 00:16:56,965
But...

243
00:16:56,966 --> 00:16:59,241
even in bed she's
a million miles away.

244
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:04,555
Sounds like you want
to encourage her with this house

245
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,541
as long as it doesn't interfere
with your life.

246
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,437
Carmela
and me, we...

247
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:12,939
we came
to an understanding

248
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,567
when we reconciled...

249
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,861
I would financially
back her spec house

250
00:17:18,862 --> 00:17:23,700
and she would have more
of a don't-ask-don't-tell policy

251
00:17:23,701 --> 00:17:25,576
towards my work

252
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:28,871
and my recreational life
outside of the home.

253
00:17:28,872 --> 00:17:30,873
But you tell me
there hasn't been

254
00:17:30,874 --> 00:17:33,251
much recreating
since the shooting.

255
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,736
No, and that's okay.

256
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,437
Fucking Janice came
to visit me at work.

257
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,605
That doesn't
happen often.

258
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,649
Well, she shops
for meat there.

259
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,776
We get it free.

260
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:01,070
And by the way, again,
if you ever need a roast

261
00:18:01,071 --> 00:18:03,740
or any specialty
kind of cut,

262
00:18:03,741 --> 00:18:05,683
please just ask.

263
00:18:07,911 --> 00:18:11,581
My dad used to
drop us off there

264
00:18:11,582 --> 00:18:13,332
when he had
to run errands.

265
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,626
We'd go into the back
and we'd steal cigarettes,

266
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:18,279
play house, you know,
shit like that.

267
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,090
Anyway, she was
all upset.

268
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:24,802
She said that
I was mean to her

269
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:27,013
and her husband.

270
00:18:27,014 --> 00:18:30,141
- What did you say?
- Well, it doesn't matter,

271
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,376
'cause she's right.

272
00:18:33,103 --> 00:18:35,480
I love it when I can
take a shit on her

273
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,482
and her husband.

274
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,150
What's that about?

275
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:42,070
Even when they told me
that Uncle Jun' might need diapers,

276
00:18:42,071 --> 00:18:44,739
I thought about Bobby
having to change him...

277
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,183
I still get
a kick out of it.

278
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:51,454
It makes Bob seem weak?

279
00:18:51,455 --> 00:18:53,664
Your sister too?

280
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:57,335
These are acts
of kindness.

281
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,712
Janice only does
"acts of Janice."

282
00:18:59,713 --> 00:19:01,506
Trust me.

283
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:04,884
You two have never
really gotten along?

284
00:19:04,885 --> 00:19:06,928
Well, not never.
She was my older sister.

285
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:09,180
I thought
she was pretty cool.

286
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,890
And she gave it back
to my mother.

287
00:19:10,891 --> 00:19:12,975
Let me tell you,
that was some heroic shit.

288
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:14,727
Because she
defended you.

289
00:19:14,728 --> 00:19:18,088
Please. It was
every man for himself.

290
00:19:19,983 --> 00:19:23,719
I remember one time
my parents left her in charge.

291
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,476
Go ahead.

292
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:35,623
Well, she stood in the hallway
and she tape-recorded

293
00:19:35,624 --> 00:19:38,609
me and Barb
having a fight.

294
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:43,280
And she held that cassette tape
over my head for a month.

295
00:19:44,967 --> 00:19:47,718
Fuckin' extortion.

296
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:51,055
Made me make her bed,
get her shit.

297
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:53,057
Did she do that
to Barbara too?

298
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:56,269
Well, that's not
the fuckin' point.

299
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,855
I've been coming here...
I don't know... five years now

300
00:19:58,856 --> 00:20:02,441
and you still don't understand what
it means to tape somebody in my family?

301
00:20:02,442 --> 00:20:05,444
You still don't fucking
get this?

302
00:20:05,445 --> 00:20:08,406
Listen, as far
as that thing goes...

303
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:11,642
the coffee
with the chicory...

304
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,706
- What the fuck is that?
- Oh shit.

305
00:20:16,707 --> 00:20:20,484
I suck at talking like this, John.
I'm sorry.

306
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:23,153
Our friend with
the stomach.

307
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:28,050
In town
or near home?

308
00:20:28,051 --> 00:20:30,160
Your neighbor.

309
00:20:31,722 --> 00:20:33,639
- A.S...
- Yeah, all right.

310
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,558
Just say, "the thing
I asked you to do."

311
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:37,710
"The coffee with
the fuckin' chicory."

312
00:20:40,022 --> 00:20:42,106
- Is he gonna get it for me?
- Yes.

313
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:45,693
Bad news is he wants
10 cups for himself.

314
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:49,030
Not seven.

315
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:51,557
All right. Done.

316
00:20:56,205 --> 00:21:00,024
Did you pick up the birthday cake
for Gin with the marzipan flowers?

317
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:02,460
The stuff behind
the pool?

318
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:05,613
No, an actual
fuckin' cake.

319
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,240
It's her birthday.

320
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,719
- What are you doing?
- I'm comin' with you.

321
00:21:30,072 --> 00:21:33,140
Okay, but stand clear.

322
00:21:36,036 --> 00:21:38,496
- What's going on?
- Pastor heard water running,

323
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:41,332
went down, basement's flooded and
they're trying to shut down the pipe.

324
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,334
But the pastor's trapped,
standing on a milk crate.

325
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:45,544
- Anybody go get him?
- There's an arcing wire hanging.

326
00:21:45,545 --> 00:21:48,631
These assholes skipped a conduit
when they remodeled.

327
00:21:48,632 --> 00:21:50,132
I spent years
as a contractor.

328
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:52,409
Electrical is where
I got started.

329
00:22:07,484 --> 00:22:10,302
Way to go, Vince!

330
00:22:11,989 --> 00:22:13,823
What the fuck
did I tell you?

331
00:22:13,824 --> 00:22:15,741
Fuck you. The guy was gonna
get cooked.

332
00:22:15,742 --> 00:22:17,410
What are you trying
to be, a big man?

333
00:22:17,411 --> 00:22:19,495
- Back the fuck off!
- What the fuck, Jim?

334
00:22:19,496 --> 00:22:22,039
Boys, boys,
calm down.

335
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,001
Okay, now let's cut the bullshit,
get the water turned off

336
00:22:25,002 --> 00:22:28,278
and pump out
the damn basement.

337
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:35,594
I gotta say, I thought you guys
were morons for doing this shit,

338
00:22:35,595 --> 00:22:38,222
but now I can see
it's a fuckin' rush.

339
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:39,849
You should join the department.
That would be good.

340
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,583
We could use
another moron.

341
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,770
Of course it's a commitment,
firefighting.

342
00:22:44,771 --> 00:22:46,188
Every day
it's there.

343
00:22:46,189 --> 00:22:48,607
You have to have
a passion, really.

344
00:22:48,608 --> 00:22:51,569
I've got these bad hips.
Supposed to have surgery.

345
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,030
Well, this is all
bullshit talk anyway.

346
00:22:54,031 --> 00:22:56,073
You're probably gonna
forget this craphole

347
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:58,600
the minute you hear
from your publisher.

348
00:23:00,203 --> 00:23:03,647
Hey, darts! Five bucks a point.
Who's in?

349
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:07,084
Nah. It's almost
midnight.

350
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,170
Where the fuck
you guys going?

351
00:23:09,171 --> 00:23:11,756
- Let's play some poker.
- Hey, you did great.

352
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:14,008
Back where I come from
the night's just startin'.

353
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:15,868
Good night.

354
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:23,167
Good week, even with
the fuckin' Dolphins.

355
00:23:25,187 --> 00:23:27,087
Night, boss.

356
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:36,906
Get his joint.

357
00:23:36,907 --> 00:23:38,282
You know
who the fuck I am?

358
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:39,742
You beat, nigga.
What?

359
00:23:39,743 --> 00:23:42,078
You come out the bookie's?
You a winner or a loser?

360
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:45,147
You're making
a big mistake.

361
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,859
Damn! Three Gs.

362
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:53,631
You got what you want.
Please don't. I got kids.

363
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,132
Yo, man,
look at his mouth.

364
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:56,467
Look at his fuckin' mouth!

365
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:57,968
Fuck this. Do him.
Do him now.

366
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:01,038
Jesus, no. Please.
No, please.

367
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:03,432
Shit!

368
00:24:03,433 --> 00:24:06,084
What the fuck are you doing, man?
Why you pull that trigger?

369
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:14,235
Well, according to John,
the retail value of Bayou Leasing

370
00:24:14,236 --> 00:24:17,279
is around six mil.
Seem about right?

371
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,932
- Between five and six.
- Let's do this again, chere.

372
00:24:21,368 --> 00:24:25,329
Well, you're gonna have to find a buyer
and deliver John's half to me

373
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,999
and in about 30 days, give you a chance
to get a couple of bidders.

374
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,669
- His half?
- Yeah.

375
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,213
I don't think
that's up for debate.

376
00:24:34,214 --> 00:24:36,507
Had you controlled
your fuckin' football jones

377
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:38,843
we wouldn't even have
no fuckin' silent partner.

378
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:42,346
That man floated me
50 grand. 50.

379
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:45,666
Next thing I know he's
buying in for half a fucking million.

380
00:24:46,268 --> 00:24:48,978
Look at him sitting there
like they don't do this shit every day.

381
00:24:48,979 --> 00:24:52,731
You took John's loan.
He helped you expand.

382
00:24:52,732 --> 00:24:54,692
Now it's time
to cash in.

383
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:58,470
Listen, Mr. Soprano, that's what
I've been saying all along.

384
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,700
You know, you two
don't seem like brothers.

385
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:05,953
In-laws. He married
my little sis.

386
00:25:05,954 --> 00:25:07,872
15 years
of womanly company

387
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:11,441
but I had to come all the way
to New Jersey to get truly fucked.

388
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:17,590
You know, I'm doing this
as a favor to John.

389
00:25:17,591 --> 00:25:19,508
And I don't need
another headache.

390
00:25:19,509 --> 00:25:21,010
So do we got
a problem here?

391
00:25:21,011 --> 00:25:23,704
No, sir.
I'm buying a boat.

392
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:28,392
Now you fancy yourself
a businessman.

393
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:32,354
Would you sell now with all that money
pouring into New Orleans?

394
00:25:32,355 --> 00:25:34,899
John Sacrimoni
asked me to.

395
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,634
Well, we're
very different people.

396
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,246
Thanks.

397
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:51,123
No belligerence.

398
00:25:51,124 --> 00:25:54,251
We kindly remain in...

399
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:58,405
...now shake hands and come
out fighting. I thank you.

400
00:26:03,053 --> 00:26:06,639
- Ahem... yeah.
- Heard about Bobby Bacala?

401
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,334
Yeah, my sister called
with the breaking news.

402
00:26:10,977 --> 00:26:12,770
That fuckin' part
of Newark...

403
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:15,005
even the cops
don't go there no more.

404
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:17,650
So you heard
everything.

405
00:26:17,651 --> 00:26:20,861
Doctors said the slug blew bits
of sidewalk into the eye there.

406
00:26:20,862 --> 00:26:22,613
Yeah, I heard.

407
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:25,783
- But they're optimistic.
- Right, doctors.

408
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:28,953
It's always good news
till it ain't.

409
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:31,622
Speaking of that, whatever the fuck
happened to you

410
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,624
with the prostate?

411
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:38,087
Well actually, T,
I've been dealing with some shit.

412
00:26:38,088 --> 00:26:40,030
Cancer, to tell
you the truth.

413
00:26:42,259 --> 00:26:43,842
What the fuck, Paulie?

414
00:26:43,843 --> 00:26:46,303
It was early.
Maybe I caught a break.

415
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:48,514
Still encapsulated.

416
00:26:48,515 --> 00:26:50,516
I'm taking a course
of radiation

417
00:26:50,517 --> 00:26:53,502
to knock the PSA back
into the single digits.

418
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:57,589
Well, are you all right?
The hair and shit?

419
00:26:57,691 --> 00:27:00,985
Heh, knock wood, eh?

420
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:03,070
I must have done
good things in my life.

421
00:27:03,071 --> 00:27:05,222
Yeah.

422
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:09,285
All right.

423
00:27:09,286 --> 00:27:10,786
The cancer...

424
00:27:10,787 --> 00:27:12,830
your ears only.

425
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,731
Absolutely.

426
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,920
You hear
about Bobby?

427
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:21,589
- Yeah.
- Should've seen him.

428
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,841
Put a patch over his eye
like Hathaway.

429
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,926
He was
really rattled.

430
00:27:25,927 --> 00:27:29,305
Still, let's face it, it was kind
of stupid to be out there that late.

431
00:27:29,306 --> 00:27:31,890
Ton', cops don't even
go there no more.

432
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:34,977
Anyway, Bobby's vision's
fucked now.

433
00:27:34,978 --> 00:27:36,770
They're hoping
the repair will take.

434
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:39,064
He could be a candidate
for a cornea transplant.

435
00:27:39,065 --> 00:27:41,692
He should be a candidate
for a brain transplant.

436
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,694
To his credit,

437
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:46,739
all he was thinking about
was straightening out for the week.

438
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,867
Fuck that "honor
and loyalty" shit.

439
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:51,869
It was
a maneuver, Carlo,

440
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,604
'cause he knew it was
his own fucking fault.

441
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,174
What?

442
00:28:05,175 --> 00:28:07,200
Don't give me
that look.

443
00:28:10,013 --> 00:28:14,058
Including
the wife's IRA

444
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:17,686
and his pension,

445
00:28:17,687 --> 00:28:21,106
we'd go
for 240 months.

446
00:28:21,107 --> 00:28:25,444
20 years and 90%
of his assets?

447
00:28:25,445 --> 00:28:27,571
Makes trial seem like
a risk worth taking.

448
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,531
Have you seen
the discovery evidence?

449
00:28:29,532 --> 00:28:31,241
You came to us.

450
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:34,244
My client insisted
the house is off-limits.

451
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:36,830
He wants his wife
provided for.

452
00:28:36,831 --> 00:28:38,374
So what do you have
in mind?

453
00:28:38,375 --> 00:28:42,628
Renee, again, the shit
that has nothing to do with him:

454
00:28:42,629 --> 00:28:45,964
the house, her IRA,
the Yukon,

455
00:28:45,965 --> 00:28:49,051
the deed
on the daughter's condo.

456
00:28:49,052 --> 00:28:52,262
- And 12 years.
- For a conspiracy to commit murder?

457
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:55,207
Get back to me
when you're sober, Ron.

458
00:28:56,726 --> 00:28:59,186
The Eagles absolutely
no good here.

459
00:28:59,187 --> 00:29:01,605
Not sure even seven will,
but the Eagles will go for it.

460
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:04,925
McNabb back to pass.
He has his receiver...

461
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,778
It's broken.
Wanna switch?

462
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:11,156
Oh, no, no.
I'm good.

463
00:29:11,157 --> 00:29:14,868
Carm just called. She's still
getting her folks in the car.

464
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:16,286
Where's Barb
and Tom?

465
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:17,955
I asked them
to bring wine.

466
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:20,541
We'll see
how long that takes.

467
00:29:20,542 --> 00:29:22,901
Did you take
the Vicodin?

468
00:29:26,005 --> 00:29:27,464
Once again, they'll have
the ball.

469
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,633
They'll take over
from their own 25 yard line.

470
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:32,886
Manning has had success throwing
the ball, Tiki Barber running the ball...

471
00:29:32,887 --> 00:29:34,871
Giants, huh?

472
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,807
Fucking blowing 'em out.

473
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:39,042
As long as they
don't beat the spread.

474
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:43,313
- Where are you going?
- Out.

475
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,482
The Giants
are kicking ass here.

476
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,901
I'm going to Eric's
to watch the Chargers.

477
00:29:47,902 --> 00:29:50,112
- What channel's that on?
- Some people aren't too cheap

478
00:29:50,113 --> 00:29:51,655
to buy the satellite package.

479
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:53,991
Sit down.
This is a Giants house.

480
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:57,703
- I hate the fucking Giants.
- Ho! What'd we say about that language?

481
00:29:57,704 --> 00:29:59,747
AJ didn't have
to come to Sunday dinner.

482
00:29:59,748 --> 00:30:03,292
AJ has a job.
Do you wanna go get a job?

483
00:30:03,293 --> 00:30:05,294
Go ahead.

484
00:30:05,295 --> 00:30:07,045
But first go get
your last report card

485
00:30:07,046 --> 00:30:09,298
and read it out loud
to everybody.

486
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:12,284
Oh... went right out
of Shockey's hands...

487
00:30:15,221 --> 00:30:18,182
No? I thought so.

488
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:21,168
Now go finish
your Spanish report before dinner.

489
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,921
Set the table,
honey.

490
00:30:28,318 --> 00:30:30,194
...tough time on that one.

491
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:32,196
He certainly doesn't mind
taking a lick or two here...

492
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:35,574
My brother-in-law
almost got his fucking eye put out.

493
00:30:35,575 --> 00:30:37,993
Some fucking
crackhead animals.

494
00:30:37,994 --> 00:30:41,288
- That is terrible.
- Yeah, it is, but...

495
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:44,208
Jesus Christ, it's one thing
after another with her family.

496
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:46,043
You mean
the bad luck?

497
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:49,171
Or do you feel like
somehow they deserve it?

498
00:30:49,172 --> 00:30:52,466
I don't know, but...

499
00:30:52,467 --> 00:30:55,010
fucking Janice
attracts drama.

500
00:30:55,011 --> 00:30:58,455
She creams
over the misery.

501
00:30:58,681 --> 00:31:01,124
Does she remind you
of anyone?

502
00:31:04,354 --> 00:31:07,231
When we were growing up,
she had something, you know?

503
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:08,649
She...

504
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:11,801
she had beautiful hair
and she was built and...

505
00:31:15,156 --> 00:31:17,324
Guys her age were always
buying me ice cream,

506
00:31:17,325 --> 00:31:19,284
giving me baseball cards,
kissing my ass

507
00:31:19,285 --> 00:31:21,686
to get in good
with her.

508
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:26,375
Sounds a little
like jealousy.

509
00:31:26,376 --> 00:31:28,919
No guy wants his sister
to be the town pump.

510
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,404
You weren't
sexually threatened?

511
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:36,552
Oh, Jesus Christ, will you make up
your fucking sick mind?

512
00:31:36,553 --> 00:31:38,929
First it's my mother.
Now I wanna fuck my sister?

513
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:42,349
It's normal,
not sick,

514
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,393
that she functioned

515
00:31:44,394 --> 00:31:47,980
as the focus of your
early sexual feelings.

516
00:31:47,981 --> 00:31:51,108
In fact, it was
probably mutual.

517
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,943
Oh, Jesus Christ.

518
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:55,237
You describe her
as "built."

519
00:31:55,238 --> 00:31:59,432
All those afternoons in your father's
office, "playing house."

520
00:32:01,202 --> 00:32:03,120
Whatever your bond,

521
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:06,690
what happened
between then and now?

522
00:32:08,501 --> 00:32:12,296
She fought it out
with my mother and finally took off

523
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:14,965
first minute
she could.

524
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:16,866
What if you
had taken off?

525
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:20,429
Well, that never
would have happened

526
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:23,473
'cause I wasn't like that.
I did what I was told.

527
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:25,976
Your father's son.

528
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:27,477
Yeah, that's right.

529
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,313
And all that went with it.

530
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:32,274
That's right.
All the success and the money.

531
00:32:32,275 --> 00:32:35,427
But beyond that, what else
did you inherit?

532
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:38,488
I'll tell you
what I inherited...

533
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:40,574
my mother.

534
00:32:40,575 --> 00:32:44,328
Janice got laid.
She took off.

535
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:46,705
She laughed
at all this shit.

536
00:32:46,706 --> 00:32:49,333
Then the trip's over
and she's back and she's one of us.

537
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:50,876
And she wants
her piece.

538
00:32:50,877 --> 00:32:53,003
Well, let me tell you,
she gets nothing!

539
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:56,698
'Cause I got the scars!
So it's mine!

540
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:24,618
What are you doing?

541
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:27,537
Cooking.
How was the call?

542
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:30,940
It was nothing.
It was a laundromat on Webster.

543
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:38,782
Thought I'd make a little dinner
like we do back home.

544
00:33:41,511 --> 00:33:45,263
We got pasta badan...

545
00:33:45,264 --> 00:33:47,516
macaroni
and potatoes...

546
00:33:47,517 --> 00:33:50,185
real peasant food.

547
00:33:50,186 --> 00:33:52,629
We got
a little salad.

548
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:56,900
Then pork chops

549
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,885
and vinegar peppers.

550
00:34:03,157 --> 00:34:06,476
I fuckin' miss
this shit, I gotta say.

551
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:09,229
I can see why.

552
00:34:23,511 --> 00:34:25,829
You gotta wait
for that.

553
00:34:29,726 --> 00:34:33,103
- What?
- Nothing.

554
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,939
I just realized...

555
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,426
the other night when you cut
the power to the church...

556
00:34:40,653 --> 00:34:43,572
- I was a real dick.
- Yeah.

557
00:34:43,573 --> 00:34:46,241
But it was only because
I was worried, you know.

558
00:34:46,242 --> 00:34:49,286
Something could've
happened to you.

559
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,438
That's a nice thing.

560
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:55,942
You don't understand.

561
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,630
Vincent...

562
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,949
I love you.

563
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,788
I love you,
"johnnycakes."

564
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:23,553
10:30, gotta be.

565
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:30,118
Hour and a half,
lunch.

566
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:33,538
The halfway
fuckin' point.

567
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:37,167
Don't look at your watch.
Not yet.

568
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:40,361
Save it.
Treat yourself.

569
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:47,010
10 to 11:00,

570
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:50,180
maybe five of.

571
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:51,515
Don't look.

572
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:54,643
Think of those sandwiches
Jim made.

573
00:35:54,644 --> 00:35:57,187
When you've eaten
the last bite,

574
00:35:57,188 --> 00:36:00,632
this fuckin' day
is halfway gone.

575
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:07,364
11:30, has to be.

576
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:10,659
Look at the angle
of the sun.

577
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,852
Maybe even
a quarter to 12:00.

578
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,957
Okay, look.

579
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:18,775
Now.

580
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,571
Fuck me!

581
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:37,769
Vincent?

582
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:40,547
Jiggle the toilet after.

583
00:36:44,485 --> 00:36:46,844
Vincent!

584
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,986
Vincent!

585
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:24,007
Moment of truth?

586
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:29,863
It's still
up to the judge,

587
00:37:29,864 --> 00:37:33,825
but they're gonna
recommend 15 years

588
00:37:33,826 --> 00:37:36,019
and $4.1 million.

589
00:37:36,996 --> 00:37:38,622
You keep the home,

590
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:42,292
the 45k in equity from the girls'
variable life insurance,

591
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:45,528
and Ginny's IRA
which is worth about 110 grand.

592
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,075
- And?
- That's it.

593
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:53,578
Or go to trial.

594
00:37:56,057 --> 00:37:58,516
15 fucking years.

595
00:37:58,517 --> 00:38:00,101
You're a young man.

596
00:38:00,102 --> 00:38:03,104
In 15 years,
you'll be 67.

597
00:38:03,105 --> 00:38:04,439
The golden years.

598
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,175
Grandkids.

599
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:16,993
Do I have to do
the allocution?

600
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:20,455
You know the allocution
is always part of it,

601
00:38:20,456 --> 00:38:22,774
practically
the whole point.

602
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:33,242
I'll take it.

603
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:41,351
That IRA of Ginny's...

604
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:44,879
she worked the tie counter
at Wanamaker's.

605
00:38:51,279 --> 00:38:53,596
That's where we met.

606
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:16,219
No Mocha Mix?

607
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,388
I was looking forward
to fresh blueberries this morning

608
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,790
but Mom hasn't shopped.

609
00:39:25,438 --> 00:39:27,814
What are you doing
hanging around here?

610
00:39:27,815 --> 00:39:29,941
Finn asked me into the city
to see a movie,

611
00:39:29,942 --> 00:39:32,110
but I didn't want to go
and I told him he could go

612
00:39:32,111 --> 00:39:34,804
if he wanted to
and he went.

613
00:39:36,282 --> 00:39:39,743
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

614
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:41,811
Don't give it
to me, okay?

615
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:48,209
I know.
I'm sorry.

616
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:51,713
It's just...

617
00:39:51,714 --> 00:39:55,091
he doesn't
fucking get it.

618
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:57,218
I don't even know
what he's thinking lately.

619
00:39:57,219 --> 00:40:00,204
He spends more time
at Jeffrey's apartment than with me.

620
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:11,090
Come on.

621
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:16,571
You know who's really good
to talk to about stuff?

622
00:40:16,572 --> 00:40:18,615
Your mother.

623
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:23,036
This whole year off together,
I've seen such a selfish side.

624
00:40:23,037 --> 00:40:26,856
"I'll come back early."
He said that. He actually said that.

625
00:40:33,422 --> 00:40:35,965
All right, well...

626
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:39,594
maybe he thought
you wanted him to go.

627
00:40:39,595 --> 00:40:41,346
I mean, you did say it.

628
00:40:41,347 --> 00:40:44,165
Yeah, or maybe
subconsciously he's done.

629
00:40:44,683 --> 00:40:47,352
We sleep together
at Jeffrey's apartment,

630
00:40:47,353 --> 00:40:49,562
and Finn sleeps
on the floor half the time

631
00:40:49,563 --> 00:40:53,483
and I'm right there
for him.

632
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:56,361
Okay, well, honey, when you're living
in sin with some guy,

633
00:40:56,362 --> 00:40:59,155
- you can't expect...
- Living in what?!

634
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:01,265
Jesus Christ.

635
00:41:04,745 --> 00:41:07,480
You should talk to your mother
about this shit!

636
00:41:10,126 --> 00:41:12,919
Did you go see that guy
at the building department yet?

637
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,697
I was going to go on Friday
when the schedules are looser.

638
00:41:17,633 --> 00:41:19,575
Well, don't.

639
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:39,387
Fuck!

640
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,766
Whoa, whoa...
whoa, whoa, whoa!

641
00:41:53,586 --> 00:41:56,713
Jesus.
Are you all right?

642
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,673
What the fuck are you doing
parked out here?

643
00:41:58,674 --> 00:42:01,426
Excuse me?
I'm getting my mail.

644
00:42:01,427 --> 00:42:03,928
You're driving
like a maniac.

645
00:42:03,929 --> 00:42:07,390
My God. How come your airbag
didn't go off?

646
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,225
Somebody took it out.
They sold it.

647
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:11,711
Sold it? Who would do
such a thing?

648
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:17,025
Look, I'm really sorry.
I was in a rush.

649
00:42:17,026 --> 00:42:18,735
So you admit
it was your fault.

650
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:20,570
Yeah, absolutely.

651
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:24,032
Let me get the damages here
and I'll be on my way.

652
00:42:24,033 --> 00:42:26,618
Mmm, we should file
a police report.

653
00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:28,536
- You got a phone?
- No, seriously.

654
00:42:28,537 --> 00:42:31,397
What do you say,
500 bucks?

655
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:34,751
Look, I took
the worst of it.

656
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:37,795
And then you call your insurance on me?
No, thank you.

657
00:42:37,796 --> 00:42:39,964
I'm not gonna
do that. Six?

658
00:42:39,965 --> 00:42:42,425
Look, I don't want
an argument here.

659
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:44,385
My place is just
up the drive there.

660
00:42:44,386 --> 00:42:46,913
We'll call the police.
They'll come right out.

661
00:42:50,184 --> 00:42:53,210
Turn on
your hazards.

662
00:42:54,188 --> 00:42:56,839
Let me get
my registration.

663
00:43:28,681 --> 00:43:30,873
Motherfucker!

664
00:43:32,184 --> 00:43:35,436
Fucking
cocksucking cunt!

665
00:43:35,437 --> 00:43:37,713
Fuck!

666
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:45,780
Tony! Hey!

667
00:43:45,781 --> 00:43:47,574
I was just coming
to see you.

668
00:43:47,575 --> 00:43:49,158
I'm on my way home.

669
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:51,035
It's just I haven't
heard from you.

670
00:43:51,036 --> 00:43:53,037
Uh, the fuckhead
from fuckland?

671
00:43:53,038 --> 00:43:56,207
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be too much effort.

672
00:43:56,208 --> 00:43:58,943
Well, John was really
counting on this.

673
00:44:00,212 --> 00:44:01,754
And Ginny
needs the money,

674
00:44:01,755 --> 00:44:04,782
for Allegra,
for the family.

675
00:44:09,471 --> 00:44:11,789
What?

676
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:20,189
He changed
the terms.

677
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,567
What, a bigger piece
for his fat mouth?

678
00:44:22,568 --> 00:44:24,902
No, smaller,
actually.

679
00:44:24,903 --> 00:44:27,388
But it's the house.

680
00:44:28,782 --> 00:44:31,034
He wants you to unload it
to his sister

681
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:33,578
at a reduced price.

682
00:44:33,579 --> 00:44:35,521
Half, actually.

683
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:38,958
But the New Orleans
thing...

684
00:44:38,959 --> 00:44:41,210
he'll knock 2% off
his finder's fee

685
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:43,946
and he'll make sure
those pricks sell.

686
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:50,036
I guess beggars
can't be choosers.

687
00:44:51,347 --> 00:44:53,122
And the worst part is

688
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:56,709
I gotta sell the idea
to Ginny somehow.

689
00:44:58,145 --> 00:45:01,356
Gab took me
to her Moroccan tile place.

690
00:45:01,357 --> 00:45:03,358
By the way...
I don't wanna pester you...

691
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,610
Did Sil make
a visit?

692
00:45:05,611 --> 00:45:07,987
Yeah, I meant
to tell you.

693
00:45:07,988 --> 00:45:10,347
He didn't have any luck
with that inspector.

694
00:45:10,658 --> 00:45:12,516
Really? You're kidding.

695
00:45:12,826 --> 00:45:16,371
No. Sorry about that.

696
00:45:16,372 --> 00:45:18,247
Did he bring him
a gift?

697
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:19,916
Cash.

698
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:22,485
So how hard
did he lean on the guy?

699
00:45:23,545 --> 00:45:26,422
Carm, Sil knows
his business.

700
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:28,966
Look, I know
you're disappointed, but...

701
00:45:28,967 --> 00:45:30,635
I just gotta
put this out there...

702
00:45:30,636 --> 00:45:33,179
just sell it.
You'll get a good price.

703
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,581
30% return
on your investment.

704
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:39,519
So that's it?
You... you just give up?

705
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,545
I don't think I ever
heard that before.

706
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,649
Look, the guy said no.

707
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:46,926
How far do you wanna
push this thing?

708
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,741
Oh, those sons
of bitches.

709
00:45:53,742 --> 00:45:56,685
All my planning
for a fucking year!

710
00:45:57,955 --> 00:46:01,023
And they let people
build those fucking monstrosities!

711
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:11,968
You wanna go out to dinner
tonight at least?

712
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:15,638
Why not put
a runner here

713
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:19,267
or a large diameter
round Oriental?

714
00:46:19,268 --> 00:46:22,145
It could cut down
on the echo and warm it up.

715
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:25,189
Well, I'd rather we spend on
what we have to right now.

716
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:27,108
Window treatments.

717
00:46:27,109 --> 00:46:30,486
Mr. Sacrimoni,
during the time period

718
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:35,533
beginning approximately
January 1, 1996, through today,

719
00:46:35,534 --> 00:46:38,995
were you employed by
or associated with

720
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:43,065
the New York faction of an organized
crime family of La Cosa Nostra?

721
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:48,129
Yes.

722
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:50,840
Sacrimoni allocuted
in federal court,

723
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:54,260
admitting at least a 10-year connection
with La Cosa Nostra.

724
00:46:54,261 --> 00:46:56,804
Fucking nauseating!

725
00:46:56,805 --> 00:46:59,307
Could have been worse.
He could have flipped.

726
00:46:59,308 --> 00:47:00,933
Are you fucking
kidding me?

727
00:47:00,934 --> 00:47:04,520
You don't ever admit the existence
of this thing. Ever.

728
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:06,547
He should have stood
trial like a man.

729
00:47:06,774 --> 00:47:09,258
I did
20 fucking years.

730
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:20,352
What?

731
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:24,540
Johnny Sack
pleaded guilty.

732
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:27,668
It was just
on the radio.

733
00:47:27,669 --> 00:47:30,196
He got 15 years.

734
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:38,204
Fuck!

735
00:47:39,723 --> 00:47:43,518
Hey! Hold on.

736
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:45,019
Wait a fucking minute.

737
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:47,063
- Are you the owner of this vehicle?
- Yeah.

738
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:50,107
I got a spot in the garage.
I went in for a half an hour, tops.

739
00:47:50,108 --> 00:47:51,734
Douchebags make
that a red zone?

740
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:55,446
This is a seizure order for all assets
belonging to John Sacrimoni.

741
00:47:55,447 --> 00:47:57,907
No, no. I bought it
from his wife.

742
00:47:57,908 --> 00:48:02,370
Well, if she sold it, she violated
a court order freezing his assets.

743
00:48:02,371 --> 00:48:06,123
Of course she sold it.
I paid her fucking 25 grand cash.

744
00:48:06,124 --> 00:48:07,917
It's going to be auctioned in May
up in Parsippany.

745
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:09,752
You like it so much,
buy it again.

746
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:12,588
This is fucking insane,
you cocksucking motherfucker!

747
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:16,575
Keep talking like that.
I'm gonna get a truck out here for you.

748
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:23,266
To think that piece of shit
was my friend once.

749
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:24,934
I hope he dies
in there.

750
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:26,811
You know
how this looks?

751
00:48:26,812 --> 00:48:30,147
I wish I was on the courthouse steps
to throw acid in his face,

752
00:48:30,148 --> 00:48:32,508
just to distance
myself.

753
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:35,052
Excuse me, Tony.

754
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:42,410
I've been
meaning to ask you...

755
00:48:42,411 --> 00:48:45,079
I was just wondering
about the Sacrimoni place.

756
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,747
What about it?

757
00:48:46,748 --> 00:48:49,542
Well, now that
Mr. Sacrimoni is guilty,

758
00:48:49,543 --> 00:48:53,195
do you think I could maybe
take him off my route?

759
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:56,299
What the fuck
did you just say, Sal?

760
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,967
I don't know.

761
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:01,829
The fucking lawnmower man
just said John was guilty, T.

762
00:49:03,348 --> 00:49:06,475
He pled guilty, Sal.
Okay?

763
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:07,852
Yeah, okay.

764
00:49:07,853 --> 00:49:09,854
With this government,
no fucking trial.

765
00:49:09,855 --> 00:49:12,648
Maybe they stuck tasers
on his balls

766
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:14,859
and beat him mercilessly
with a rubber hose.

767
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,694
- You ever think of that?
- No.

768
00:49:16,695 --> 00:49:19,655
But of course,
it makes sense.

769
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:22,950
Don't besmirch
the man, Sal.

770
00:49:22,951 --> 00:49:25,369
So about the yard...

771
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:28,063
Do you believe
this fucking guy?

772
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:33,669
You're done with that.

773
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:37,239
Come on. Let's go
check out these DVDs.

774
00:50:01,615 --> 00:50:04,992
Have to take about
35-40 of them.

775
00:50:04,993 --> 00:50:06,869
No gain, 2nd and 10.

776
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:10,122
Green on a roll
to the near side.

777
00:50:10,123 --> 00:50:12,541
Gets it away
and has a completion...

778
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:14,961
Mead, put
the cavatell' in.

779
00:50:14,962 --> 00:50:17,588
- Hey there.
- Hi.

780
00:50:17,589 --> 00:50:20,532
- Where's Christopher?
- He went out to an AA meeting.

781
00:50:26,974 --> 00:50:29,375
- Tony?
- Yeah.

782
00:50:34,648 --> 00:50:37,900
I just wanted to say

783
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:39,635
thank you.

784
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:44,473
You're welcome.

785
00:50:48,161 --> 00:50:52,564
No one's ever done
something so... so...

786
00:50:54,793 --> 00:50:58,278
It's okay, Janice.
Really.

787
00:51:00,298 --> 00:51:02,491
Sorry.

788
00:51:05,887 --> 00:51:07,972
- Hey Tony?
- Uh-huh.

789
00:51:07,973 --> 00:51:10,999
You got the wine?
We're almost ready.

790
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:13,961
Hey, what happened?

791
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:19,942
Jan.

792
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:23,487
No one knows
what goes on in my head.

793
00:51:23,488 --> 00:51:27,074
What's the matter?
What happened?

794
00:51:27,075 --> 00:51:31,228
She's happy...
about the house.

795
00:51:33,874 --> 00:51:36,250
Oh, honey,
it's okay.

796
00:51:36,251 --> 00:51:38,527
It's okay.

797
00:51:41,214 --> 00:51:44,199
- Come on. You okay?
- Oh... yeah.

798
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:48,537
- You all right?
- Yeah.

798
00:51:49,305 --> 00:52:49,791

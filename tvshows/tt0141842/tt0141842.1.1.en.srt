2
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,078
Mr. Soprano?

3
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,705
Yeah.

4
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,884
Have a seat.

5
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:49,209
My understanding from Dr. Cusamano,
your physician...

6
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,086
...is that you collapsed.

7
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:55,090
Possibly a panic attack?
You were unable to breathe?

8
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:58,218
They said it was a panic attack.

9
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,847
The blood and neurological
work came back negative.

10
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,434
And they sent me here.

11
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,728
You don't agree that
you had a panic attack?

12
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,108
How are you feeling now?

13
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,359
Good.

14
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,237
Fine. Back at work.

15
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,782
What line of work are you in?

16
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,243
Waste management consultant.

17
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,462
It's impossible for me to
talk to a psychiatrist.

18
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:38,008
Any thoughts at all
on why you blacked out?

19
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,804
I don't know. Stress, maybe.

20
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,807
About what?

21
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:54,942
I don't know.

22
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,987
The morning I got sick,
I'd been thinking.

23
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:04,159
It's good to be in something
from the ground floor.

24
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,496
And I came too late for that, I know.

25
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:11,792
But lately, I'm getting the feeling
that I came in at the end.

26
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,418
The best is over.

27
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,838
Many Americans, I think,
feel that way.

28
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,549
I think about my father.

29
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:22,219
He never reached the heights like me.

30
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,346
In a lot of ways he had it better.

31
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,934
He had his people, they had
their standards, they had pride.

32
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,811
Today, what do we got?

33
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:40,195
Did you have these feelings of loss
more acutely before you collapsed?

34
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,073
I don't know.

35
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:04,261
A couple months before, these
two ducks landed in my pool.

36
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:08,557
It was amazing. They're from Canada,
and it was mating season.

37
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,685
They had some ducklings.

38
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,899
Come on, get some bread.

39
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,994
My daughter's friend was there
to drive her to school.

40
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:33,582
- Meadow, your father with those ducks.
- The yard smells like duck poo.

41
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,793
You gotta have more than
just juice for breakfast.

42
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:41,256
You need brain food for school.
Happy birthday, handsome.

43
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,800
- Thirteen.
- He doesn't act it.

44
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:47,763
The male and female duck made
a home in your pool and did it?

45
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,515
Get out of here! You're so gross!

46
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,101
You want some of
last night's sfogliatelle?

47
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,146
- Get out of here with that fat.
- One bite.

48
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,106
How do you stay skinny,
Mrs. Soprano?

49
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,945
Him, with those ducks.

50
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:08,116
If you don't like that ramp, I'll
build another. Maybe it's the wood.

51
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,628
Look, they're trying to fly.

52
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,174
- National Geographic, Dad.
- Yeah, super.

53
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,135
- You showed us yesterday.
- This is great!

54
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:31,807
Now my wife feels
this friend is a bad influence.

55
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:35,143
It's so cool you're coming to Aspen
with my family at Christmas.

56
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:39,856
Last year I saw Skeet Ulrich,
as close as from where you're sitting.

57
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,983
Miss Meadow, we made a deal.

58
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:46,822
Keep your grades up and your curfew
until Christmas, then you get to go.

59
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,657
I know that.

60
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,950
Good morning.

61
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,369
- Hey, Mr. Soprano.
- We're late, Dad.

62
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,871
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks, Dad.

63
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:06,174
You're gonna be home tonight for
Anthony Jr.'s birthday party, right?

64
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,345
Birdman, hello!

65
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,223
Yeah, yeah.
I'll get home early from work.

66
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,184
I'm not talking about work.

67
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,857
This won't work.
I can't talk about my personal life.

68
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:25,026
Finish telling me
about the day you collapsed.

69
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:32,659
I drove to work with my nephew.
He's learning the business.

70
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,370
He's an example of what
I was talking about before.

71
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:39,916
Did you call Triborough Towers
about the hauling contract?

72
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,879
I got home too late.
I didn't want to wake the man up.

73
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:48,717
Did you get up early and call?
He's always in his office by 6.

74
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,888
I was nauseous. My mother told me
I shouldn't even come in today.

75
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:57,058
Bear in mind, this is a kid who
just bought himself a $60,000 Lexus.

76
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,026
- There's that guy Mahaffey.
- Get out.

77
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,737
Right there.
Next to the boo-boo in pink.

78
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,406
Back up.

79
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:26,922
My friend Mahaffey
pulling his taffy. Hello.

80
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,798
We saw this guy.

81
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,218
There was an outstanding loan.

82
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:32,594
One second.

83
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,098
I don't know
where this story is going.

84
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:42,562
But there are a few ethical ground
rules we should get out of the way.

85
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,274
What you tell me here...

86
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,778
...falls under
doctor/patient confidentiality.

87
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,613
Except if I was...

88
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,910
If I was to hear, let's say,
a murder was to take place...

89
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,120
Not that it would, but if.

90
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:03,291
If a patient tells me a story
where someone's going to get hurt...

91
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,461
...I'm supposed to go
to the authorities.

92
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,964
Technically.

93
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,303
You said you were in waste management.

94
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,138
The environment.

95
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,225
Dr. Cusamano, besides
being your family physician...

96
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,978
...is also your next-door neighbor.

97
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,646
See what I'm saying?

98
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:28,233
I don't know what happened
with this fellow, I'm...

99
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,277
I'm just saying.

100
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,363
Nothing.

101
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,657
We had coffee.

102
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,742
Alex!

103
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,327
Help!

104
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,003
Security! Help!

105
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,963
Oh, shit.

106
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,692
Asshole!

107
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,197
Tony!

108
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:17,866
Wait up!

109
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,915
Security!

110
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,108
You all right?

111
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,736
My leg is broken.
The bone's coming through.

112
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,071
Let me see.

113
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:59,824
I'll give you a fucking bone,
you prick! Where's my fucking money?

114
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,243
So you had coffee.

115
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,912
Right.

116
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,831
You son of a bitch, motherfucker.

117
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:15,590
- What are you doing? Get over here!
- That's $3000 here. $3000.

118
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,883
Go ahead.

119
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,638
Where's the fucking money?

120
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,264
I'll get the money!

121
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,766
I know you will.

122
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,269
You should get a cork in your mouth
because you say I'm nothing...

123
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,272
...compared to the people
who used to run things. Prick.

124
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,274
I'm nothing.

125
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,782
Shut up.

126
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,120
What are you crying about? HMO.
You're covered.

127
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,080
You prick.

128
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,126
Degenerate fucking gambler.

129
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:52,877
Go on.

130
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,629
Next, I had a meeting.

131
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,425
I was called in to consult by
a garbage-hauling company I represent.

132
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,635
What's the story
with Triborough Towers?

133
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:05,640
The manager wants the contract
with Dick, but this Kolar Sanitation...

134
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,809
Another nationwide company.

135
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,813
The Kolar brothers. Czechoslovakian
immigrants or some shit.

136
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:15,024
These Polacks will haul
paper, plastic and aluminum...

137
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,943
...for 7000 a month less than Dick.

138
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,821
They pay us 40 times the monthly
for stealing a stop.

139
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,614
That's the thing. They won't.

140
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:26,327
Says if he can tell the commie bosses
in Czechoslovakia to fuck off...

141
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,329
...he can fucking tell us.

142
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,124
- I give up.
- Fucking garbage business.

143
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,543
Yeah, I know. It's all changing.

144
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,503
Let me see what I can do.

145
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,339
Sure? You over your stomachache?

146
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,508
- Oh, yeah.
- Good.

147
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,428
What are you doing here?

148
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,723
Gabriella sends me
down here for the capocollo.

149
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,434
Hey, T, let me ask you something.

150
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,979
Didn't you used to go to school
with Artie Bucco?

151
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:56,065
A situation came up.
It involves my uncle.

152
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,485
I can't go into details.

153
00:12:58,694 --> 00:12:59,694
That's fine.

154
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:04,032
But I will say this. My uncle
adds to my general stress level.

155
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,701
It's none of my business...

156
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,829
...but down at the club,
the word is...

157
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,041
...your Uncle Junior
is gonna whack Pussy Malanga.

158
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,880
He's gonna do it
at Artie Bucco's restaurant.

159
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,518
Hey, boys. How are you?

160
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,063
Don't move.

161
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,732
- Uncle Junior, how you doing?
- Hey.

162
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,984
Hey, good to see you.

163
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,736
Hi there, Chris.

164
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:46,074
I was talking about you. It's Anthony
Jr.'s birthday tonight, right?

165
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:50,912
Don't buy him anything big,
we overindulge him. Okay?

166
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,581
Hey!

167
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,543
- Artie, how's your rash?
- It's itchy.

168
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:57,794
Come here.

169
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:02,048
- Good to see you. You'll come over?
- Yeah, have a seat.

170
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,138
You know what it means, one of
these mutts gets wet in here?

171
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,599
It'll ruin his business.

172
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,060
You better sit down with your uncle.

173
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,649
Uncle Junior's my father's brother.

174
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,735
A good guy, just getting old, cranky.

175
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,615
He used to take me to Yankee games
when I was a kid.

176
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,617
I love my uncle.

177
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,621
At the same time, when I was young...

178
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:37,625
...he told my girl cousins
I would never be a varsity athlete.

179
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,753
Frankly, that was a tremendous blow
to my self-esteem.

180
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,361
Who's there?

181
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:06,821
It's me, Ma.

182
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,490
Who are you?

183
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,993
Ma, open the door.

184
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:19,125
- Anthony?
- Yeah, it's me. Open the door.

185
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,590
Hi, how are you?

186
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,677
Jeez, Ma. Get some air in here.

187
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,388
Did you lock the door?

188
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,017
- Yeah, I did.
- Somebody called here last night.

189
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,394
- After dark.
- Who?

190
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,230
You think I'd answer?
It was dark out.

191
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,358
Ma, I'll never understand that.

192
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,860
The phone is auditory.
Dark is an eye thing.

193
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,489
I could understand not going out.
You could get jumped.

194
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:50,865
But the phone?

195
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:55,828
Listen to him, he knows everything.
You want some lunch? I got eggplant.

196
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,374
No, no, I just ate.
Know who I just ran into?

197
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,541
Uncle Jun.

198
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:05,630
Oh, that one. You think he ever
comes to see his sister-in-law?

199
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,132
Remember Artie Bucco?

200
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,385
Kid I went to elementary school with?

201
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:14,180
Oh, yeah, I still see his mother.

202
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,433
She tells me...

203
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:21,020
...he calls her every day.

204
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,565
Well, Uncle Junior's gonna
make a problem for Artie.

205
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,192
Could affect his livelihood.

206
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,195
- What's that?
- CD player.

207
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,280
For who?

208
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,740
For me?

209
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,034
- I don't want it.
- You don't want it.

210
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:39,247
You love music, all the old stuff's
on CD. Your favorites.

211
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,582
"Pajama Game," Connie Francis.

212
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:42,917
Here.

213
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:47,755
Come on.

214
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,091
Move around a bit.
It's good for you.

215
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,385
What? No.

216
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:56,097
- Come on. Come on.
- Stop it.

217
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:01,811
You need to occupy your mind. When
Dad died, you were gonna do things.

218
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:05,940
- He was a saint.
- I know he was. But he's gone.

219
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,068
You were gonna travel, volunteer.
You've done nothing.

220
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,280
Stop telling me how to live my life.
Just shut up.

221
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,282
I just worry...

222
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,452
And don't start with that
nursing home business again.

223
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:21,497
It's not a nursing home,
it's a retirement community!

224
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:25,418
You interact with seniors
your own age, go places, do things!

225
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:28,004
I've seen women in nursing homes...

226
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,965
...in these wheelchairs,
babbling like idiots!

227
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,967
Here, eat your eggplant.

228
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,303
I told you, I already ate lunch.

229
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,308
All right, listen.

230
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:44,270
You just speak to Uncle Junior
about Artie, okay?

231
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,314
He respects you.
He'll listen to you.

232
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:51,319
If your uncle has business with Arthur,
he knows what he's doing.

233
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:55,948
And I don't?

234
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,745
Well, all I know is...

235
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,873
...daughters are better at taking care
of their mothers than sons.

236
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,001
Yeah, and I bought CDs
for a broken record.

237
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:15,551
I expect to see you at Anthony Jr.'s
party with your baked ziti.

238
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,805
Only if I'm picked up
and I'm brought back home.

239
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:22,391
I don't drive
when they're predicting rain.

240
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,977
You're healthy.
It's good for you to drive.

241
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,396
Use it or lose it.
I gotta go to work.

242
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,023
Sure...

243
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,025
...run off!

244
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,696
And that night was
my son's birthday party.

245
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,699
My wife invites the priest.
He's always at the house.

246
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,159
- Hey, Tony.
- How you doing?

247
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,745
- You like crème anglaise?
- You bless it, I'll eat it.

248
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:43,913
She's not coming.

249
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,998
- Who?
- Grandma just called.

250
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,417
She started crying and hung up.

251
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,420
- She needs a purpose.
- She's tougher than you think.

252
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,090
- So, what? No fucking ziti now?
- Hey!

253
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,748
At first it felt like...

254
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,917
...ginger ale in my skull.

255
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:44,140
- Mom, Daddy just fell! Mom!
- Oh, my God. Tony!

256
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,561
Get back!

257
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,898
Daddy! Dad!

258
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,609
Anthony Jr., call 911.

259
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:11,918
Dr. Cusamano put me in the
hospital, gave me every kind of test.

260
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,638
Okay.

261
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,144
Hey! Carm.

262
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,943
- Thought you might want some company.
- Yeah.

263
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,488
6:30 in the morning.

264
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:46,118
- How are the kids?
- They're worried about you.

265
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:50,289
I told Anthony Jr.
we'd rain-check his birthday.

266
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,174
Think I got a brain tumor?

267
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,510
Well, we're gonna find out.

268
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,680
What a bedside manner.
Very encouraging.

269
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,556
What, are you gonna not know?

270
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:15,147
We had some good times.
Had some good years.

271
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,316
Here he goes with the nostalgia.

272
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,360
No marriage is perfect.

273
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,362
Having that goomar on the side helps.

274
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:25,199
I'm not seeing her anymore.
What about that priest?

275
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,826
Don't even go there.

276
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:30,746
Father is a spiritual mentor.
He's making me a better Catholic!

277
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,708
Well, we all got different needs.

278
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,712
What's different between us is,
you're going to hell when you die.

279
00:21:56,398 --> 00:22:00,776
My nephew, Christopher, was
handling the garbage contract problem.

280
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,904
But on this I will also
not go into detail.

281
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,631
Emil Kolar.

282
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,884
Chris Moltisanti.

283
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,721
Hey, in Czech Republic too,
we love pork.

284
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,806
You ever have our sausages?

285
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:35,603
No. I thought the only sausages
they had was Italian and Jimmy Dean's.

286
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:39,106
See what you learn when you
cross cultures and shit?

287
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:43,277
My Uncle Evzen doesn't know I came.

288
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,946
If we make any progress,
I'll tell him.

289
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:50,159
Hey, we have to make progress, Emil.
We gotta stop the madness.

290
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,329
Business is changing,
we're the younger generation.

291
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,122
We have issues in common.

292
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,917
Emil.

293
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:02,296
Where'd you go to high school?
Was it Poland?

294
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,840
I'm not Polish.

295
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:08,135
Czechoslovakian,
that's a type of Polack, right?

296
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,764
We came here when I was 9.
I went to West Essex.

297
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:15,142
You used to play my cousin Gregory
in football, he...

298
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,437
- Where's the stuff?
- Yes, yes, yes.

299
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:24,610
The reason for the visit.
We got it all deployed for you.

300
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,822
Taste the wares, Emil.

301
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:29,990
Emil.

302
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:59,395
The doctors kept me hanging
about the tests, as doctors will do.

303
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:03,357
So my uncle and I played
a round of golf and had lunch.

304
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:07,027
You keep mentioning your uncle.
What's the problem?

305
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,696
Who do you think you are?

306
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:12,158
I'm the person who says
how things go, that's who.

307
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:16,203
Artie's dinner business is nice,
upscale people from the suburbs.

308
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,830
Don't ruin his life.

309
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,875
Vesuvio is where Pussy feels safe.

310
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,627
He's been eating here all his life.

311
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,713
You kill him someplace else.

312
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:29,049
You may run North Jersey,
but you don't run your uncle!

313
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:32,761
How many fucking hours did I spend
playing catch with you?

314
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:40,728
Can we focus more
on your immediate family?

315
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,690
My wife and daughter
were not getting along.

316
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:50,279
Darn, these laser discs
are incredible!

317
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:56,076
Tony watches Godfather II. He says
it looks just like the movie theater.

318
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,662
Gordon Willis.
Tony prefers II, not I?

319
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,582
He likes where Vito
goes back to Sicily.

320
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:04,084
With III, he was like,
"What happened?"

321
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,669
Where does Tony rank Goodfellas?

322
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,090
What, do you have raccoons?

323
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,968
- Somebody's jimmying a window.
- What?

324
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,597
You have all these security
lights, who would try and?

325
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,267
Oh, no. Jeez, Louise!

326
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,269
Hold it!

327
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:23,938
Meadow.

328
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,610
I noticed the glass rattles every time
I walk to the laundry room.

329
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,612
Do we have any putty?

330
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,989
Don't give me that.
You snuck out!

331
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,449
What's going on?

332
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,077
You locked my bedroom window
so I'd get caught.

333
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:41,455
Normal people thought you were
upstairs doing your homework!

334
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:45,292
You have become a master
of lying and conniving.

335
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,127
I know I'm grounded.

336
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,089
Patrick's swim meet is tomorrow,
and he needed me!

337
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:53,467
Grounded for this?
Oh, no, you're not grounded.

338
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:57,846
You're not going to Aspen
with Hunter Scangarelo!

339
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,640
Yes!

340
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,767
But this shit I'm telling you...

341
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,144
...it'll all blow over.

342
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:11,235
Didn't you admit to Dr. Cusamano
that you were feeling depressed?

343
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,498
"Melfi."

344
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,835
What part of the boot you from?

345
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,004
Dr. Melfi.

346
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,465
My father's people were from Caserta.

347
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,175
Avellino.

348
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:38,512
My mother would have loved it
if you and I got together.

349
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:50,024
Anxiety attacks are legitimate
psychiatric emergencies.

350
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,526
Suppose you were driving
and you passed out.

351
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,194
Let me tell you something.

352
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:57,531
Nowadays, everybody's gotta go
to shrinks and counselors...

353
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:01,327
...and go on Sally Jessy Raphael
and talk about their problems.

354
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:04,204
Whatever happened to Gary Cooper?

355
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,707
The strong, silent type?

356
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,375
That was an American.

357
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,295
He wasn't in touch
with his feelings.

358
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:15,215
They didn't realize once they got Gary
Cooper in touch with his feelings...

359
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:16,884
...they wouldn't be able
to shut him up!

360
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:20,095
So it's dysfunction this and
that! And dysfunction va fangool!

361
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,390
You have strong feelings about this.

362
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,186
I had a semester and a half
of college...

363
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:30,898
...so I understand Freud.
I understand therapy as a concept.

364
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,817
But in my world, it does not go down.

365
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:37,738
Could I be happier?
Yeah. Yeah. Who couldn't?

366
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,407
Do you feel depressed?

367
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,454
Do you feel depressed?

368
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,212
Since the ducks left...

369
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:55,714
I guess.

370
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:59,593
The ducks that preceded
your losing consciousness.

371
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,137
Let's talk about them.

372
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,904
You can't blame T for being pissed.
You should have waited.

373
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,615
That's the last time I show
any fucking initiative.

374
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,951
Imagine how I felt?

375
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,744
T's running down the business...

376
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,288
...I fucking wet a guy
to keep one of our stops.

377
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:31,959
He's not running it down.
It's just getting harder in New York.

378
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,129
One.

379
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,630
Two.

380
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,257
Three.

381
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,467
Come on!

382
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,303
- This is fucked up.
- What, Pussy?

383
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:47,099
The Kolar uncle is gonna find the kid
dead on one of his bins...

384
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,935
...and get out of our
fucking business? No way.

385
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,187
"Louis Brassi sleeps with the fishes."

386
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,607
Luca Brassi.

387
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,317
- Luca.
- Whatever.

388
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,404
There's differences, Christopher.

389
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:03,323
From the Luca Brassi situation
and this?

390
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:09,204
Look, if the Kolars know the kid is
dead, it hardens their position.

391
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:13,125
Plus, now the cops are looking
for a fucking murderer.

392
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,668
What do you want to do?

393
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,005
He disappears.
He never comes home.

394
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,340
They know, but they don't know.

395
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,927
They hope maybe he'll turn up... if.

396
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,639
Come on. Let's get him.

397
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,475
Got him?

398
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,227
Take him to Staten Island,
I'll cut him up.

399
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,856
Pussy, you know, with T
collapsing at the birthday...

400
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:39,985
...what would you do
if he was, like, disabled?

401
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,987
Why would you even ask that?

402
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,700
Our lecture series in action.

403
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,744
Someone from the university
discussing...

404
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:52,247
...the novels of, I believe,
Zora Neale Hurston.

405
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,668
Didn't you just read her
in school, Med?

406
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,379
It's very nice.

407
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,721
You know, Grandma,
this place is neat.

408
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,890
You should really think about it.

409
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,227
This room was renovated last year.

410
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,978
What goes on behind there?

411
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,106
Those doors lead to our nursing unit.

412
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,235
This is a nursing home!

413
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,403
This is a residence,
but just in case...

414
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,740
No, you're not getting me
into a nursing home.

415
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,784
You're not listening
to what she's saying.

416
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,286
Women in wheelchairs,
babbling like idiots!

417
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,121
Ma, you're not listening.

418
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,375
You think you're so high and mighty,
don't you?

419
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:39,086
With your fancy office.

420
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:42,548
Anthony, people come here to die!

421
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:51,265
Oh, my God! Somebody get a doctor.

422
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:04,111
So you've come back for help.
Don't look at that as a defeat.

423
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,322
She's one of those who grew up
during the Depression.

424
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:10,450
But the Depression to her
was a trip to Six Flags.

425
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,286
There's that "D" word again.

426
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,752
Stay with your mother.

427
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:28,760
Now that my father's dead,
he's a saint.

428
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,931
When he was alive, nothing.

429
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,647
My dad was tough, he ran his own crew.

430
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:45,444
A guy like that and my mother
wore him down to a little nub.

431
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:48,780
He was a squeaking little gerbil
when he died.

432
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:53,660
Quite a formidable maternal presence.

433
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:02,502
I gotta be honest. I'm not getting
any satisfaction from my work, either.

434
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,004
Why?

435
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,341
Well, because of RICO.

436
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,802
- Is he your brother?
- No. The RICO Statutes.

437
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,346
Oh, of course, right.

438
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:13,513
You read the papers?

439
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,849
You know, the government's using
electronic surveillance...

440
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:20,604
...and various legal strategies
to squeeze my business.

441
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:28,153
Do you have any qualms about
how you actually make a living?

442
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,739
Yeah.

443
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,243
I find I have to be the sad clown.

444
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:38,622
Laughing on the outside...

445
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,499
...crying on the inside.

446
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,210
See, things are trending downward.

447
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,839
Used to be, a guy got pinched,
he took his prison jolt.

448
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,717
Everybody upheld a code of silence.

449
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:54,221
Nowadays, no values.

450
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,724
Guys today have no room
for the penal experience.

451
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,060
So everybody turns government witness.

452
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,942
I feel exhausted
just talking about it.

453
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:12,572
Well, with today's pharmacology,
no one needs to suffer...

454
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:16,368
...with feelings of
exhaustion and depression.

455
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:21,123
Here we go.
Here comes the Prozac.

456
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,966
Mahaffey doesn't have it.

457
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,926
What do you mean
he doesn't have it?

458
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,261
He doesn't have the money.

459
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,762
How can he not have the money?

460
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,265
The man does not have the money.

461
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,934
We ran the man over with the car.
T, himself.

462
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:44,479
The man has no wiggle room.
He's bled dry.

463
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,444
So...

464
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,239
...I hear Junior wants to
whack Pussy Bompensiero?

465
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:57,117
- Pussy Malanga.
- Oh, Little Pussy.

466
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,619
You think he's gonna
fuck with Big Pussy?

467
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,413
My Pussy?

468
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,457
Andrea.

469
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:08,295
Stay with drinks on the house
all night.

470
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:11,131
- Sorry, Mr. Dante.
- It's okay.

471
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:16,303
So your uncle resents
that you're the boss.

472
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,138
The sadness accrues.

473
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,141
Your uncle's had a hard-on
his whole life.

474
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,518
First, against your father,
his younger brother...

475
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,604
...because he was a made man
before him.

476
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,481
And now, you.

477
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:31,651
So, sure, he can't stomach
your telling him what to do.

478
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:34,154
Hesh, I love the man.

479
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:38,116
The man is driven in toto
by his insecurities.

480
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,619
I feel bad I was the messenger.

481
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:45,248
Your friend Artie,
with the restaurant.

482
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,125
Get him out of town.

483
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:51,755
That way the restaurant closes,
the hit goes down someplace else.

484
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,634
You old fucking Jew.

485
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:58,136
No wonder my old man
kept you around so long.

486
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:01,848
So what about this fucking Jew's
250 on Mahaffey's 100?

487
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,772
Mahaffey has a new business partner...

488
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,273
...you.

489
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,359
These HMOs pay out millions...

490
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,153
...to doctors, hospitals, whatever.

491
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,490
That MRI I had,
$2000 a pop.

492
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,992
Now, we give this Mahaffey a choice.

493
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,578
Either his company pays out
phony claims...

494
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:26,039
...to fake clinics we set up...

495
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:30,710
...or he pays Hesh
the 250 grand he owes him...

496
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,171
...which we know he cannot do.

497
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,552
Or it's a rainy night in Lyndhurst.

498
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:43,098
Very smart.
Could be major.

499
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,559
Could be as good as garbage.

500
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:49,729
- Garbage is our bread and butter.
- Was.

501
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,117
Miss Meadow!

502
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,538
So, Med.

503
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,249
I'm not going.

504
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,587
Every year, on this date,
since you were itty-bitty...

505
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,922
...Mom and Meadow get all dolled up...

506
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:21,094
...drive into New York Plaza Hotel
for tea under Eloise's portrait.

507
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,971
Look, where's yours?

508
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,723
I have too much homework.

509
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,100
Meadow, its our little tradition!

510
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,935
We always have so much fun!

511
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:32,439
To tell you the truth,
I felt it was dumb since I was 8!

512
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:35,066
I just go because you like it.

513
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:42,782
Here I thought this was something we
would do long after you got married...

514
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,910
...with girls of your own.

515
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,870
Hopefully I won't be
living around here by then.

516
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,122
You've got mail.

517
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:55,921
Meadow, you can't just lie and cheat
and break the rules you don't like!

518
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:01,134
What? You have something
you want to say?

519
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:06,598
Mom, do you have any idea how much
it means to go skiing in Aspen?

520
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,267
Do you think that'll
happen every year?

521
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,938
Like lame tea and scones
at the Plaza Hotel?

522
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:18,485
- Goodbye.
- Close my door, please.

523
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,196
Artie.

524
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:26,159
Give me a drop. Oh! A drop,
not a spurt. Soave, a drop!

525
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,788
- How are you?
- All right. Stir the meatballs.

526
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,666
- Could you help me out?
- Yeah, what do you need?

527
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,834
Cruise. Caribbean.

528
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:38,004
S.S. Sagafjord, 11th through the 29th.

529
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,423
Pair of tickets. I can't use them.

530
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,509
Can you take them off my hands?

531
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,803
- Where'd they come from?
- Comps.

532
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,222
Comps?

533
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:48,848
What does that mean?

534
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,851
As manager for the Kitchen
and Restaurant Workers Union...

535
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:55,480
...I administer the dental plan.
You listening to me?

536
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:59,359
A couple of dentists got together
and awarded me these tickets.

537
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:02,362
The problem is,
I can't get away those dates.

538
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:08,034
Here. When was your last vacation?

539
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,870
- Anthony, thank you.
- All right.

540
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,879
Mr. Soprano?

541
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:31,224
You cannot accept a gift
like that from Tony Soprano! No way!

542
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:32,726
Listen to me, Charmaine...

543
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:36,354
...if I stick my hand up the ass of
one more lobster without a break...

544
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,856
...I'm gonna go postal.

545
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:41,401
I don't even want to talk about it
anymore, please!

546
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:45,697
Art, Melissa, come on, honey.
It's time to go home.

547
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:50,243
You have to get away.
We have to get away for the marriage.

548
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:55,498
No! It's bad enough that these
mobsters patronize the place, okay?

549
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,500
So what? We're not connected.

550
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,712
Right. Because we just
turned down those tickets!

551
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:04,632
But the tickets were comps.
Tony is a labor leader.

552
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,551
Arthur, please. Grow up!

553
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:10,597
Does the mind not rebel at any
scenario under which dentists...

554
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:15,518
...are sending the don of New Jersey
first class on a Norwegian steamship?

555
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:19,606
Come on, Arthur, somebody donated
their kneecaps for those tickets!

556
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:23,818
Herman, there is no way I can
subvert my fucking company.

557
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:27,155
Have them pay claims for MRIs
that never happened?

558
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:30,909
- The paperwork will look real.
- How do I not get caught?

559
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:34,287
I hate to hear you knocking yourself.
You're a smart guy.

560
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:38,249
I'm depressed. I'm so fucking
depressed I can't eat, sleep.

561
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,294
- You on Prozac?
- Zoloft. It's similar.

562
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,838
- It's supposed to help with gambling.
- No shit.

563
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:46,341
This new generation
of antidepressants...

564
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,594
...are supposed to be useful
against compulsive behaviors.

565
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,096
That's a shame.

566
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,848
A medication comes along
after your gambling...

567
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,476
...gets your fucking hip
busted to shit.

568
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,937
I'm trying not to be cynical.

569
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:03,066
Your debt and the feelings surrounding
it is the source of all your problems.

570
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,819
I'm sorry I haven't paid you, Herman.

571
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,487
I know you are.

572
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,948
And I never meant to
denigrate Tony Soprano.

573
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:12,700
- Want to walk on the rocks?
- Crutches, I can't.

574
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:15,954
It's beautiful out there.
Come on, we'll help you.

575
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,831
I go out there to think.

576
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,180
Thanks, but no.

577
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,351
Let's try it.

578
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:42,355
What you were saying before
with the MRIs and...

579
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,545
T!

580
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,132
Dick's looking for you!

581
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:13,887
Hey, Tony, I just heard
from Triborough Towers.

582
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,223
The Kolar brothers withdrew their bid.

583
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:18,725
That's good. That's good.

584
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,895
Listen, by the way,
Artie Bucco's here to see you.

585
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,439
- I gotta go, guys.
- Take care.

586
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,071
Artie!

587
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,365
Artie, you all right?

588
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,204
- I can't.
- What are you talking about?

589
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:42,290
We discussed this.
You gotta leave town.

590
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,791
I'm sorry.

591
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,301
This is unacceptable.

592
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,803
I made a reservation two weeks ago.

593
00:41:56,055 --> 00:42:00,058
Sir, people are not leaving, and there
are five parties ahead of you.

594
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:02,936
- So what would you like...?
- Can I help you?

595
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,440
I tore her a new one.

596
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:11,444
Why don't we just go
to another restaurant and eat?

597
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:12,946
We're here.

598
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,615
Mr. Soprano, how you doing?
Good to see you.

599
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,283
How you doing?

600
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,202
- Signora.
- Hello.

601
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,287
This way. Excuse me.

602
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:30,004
Sweetie-pie, I'm hungry.
Tony, where you going?

603
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,965
Hey. How are you?

604
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,633
Good.

605
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,636
You come here?

606
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,596
When possible.

607
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:43,768
Those decorating tips you gave me,
they really work.

608
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:45,979
Good.

609
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:48,982
How you doing?

610
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,488
Nils, Nils?

611
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,282
Do you know who that was?

612
00:42:57,491 --> 00:43:00,159
Well, I mean, obviously you do.

613
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:01,995
What, is he a patient?

614
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,621
You know I can't say.

615
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:10,378
Decorating tips, yeah, right.

616
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,672
Nils, shut the fuck up.

617
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:15,883
Mr. Borglund, they're setting up
your table now.

618
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,012
Whoa.

619
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,849
Who was that woman at the restaurant?

620
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:24,517
My decorator.

621
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,186
What?
You're redoing the garbage dump?

622
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:30,690
That's funny. Hey, you better
not mess with that hat!

623
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:37,030
Come on, it's JFK's hat!
I bought it at that auction.

624
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,406
Give me that!

625
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,367
Irina, Jesus.

626
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:45,705
I know there is something more
intimate between you and her.

627
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,207
Nothing intimate. We just talk.

628
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:00,178
Mr. Soprano, buona sera.

629
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,388
We don't see you.
Where you been?

630
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,938
You know, sometimes...

631
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,399
...life is good.

632
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,568
Life is often good.

633
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,072
Regaleali, for example.

634
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,201
You've been in good spirits
the last couple days.

635
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:36,089
Carmela, there's something
I gotta confess.

636
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,094
What are you doing?

637
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,097
Getting my wine in position
to throw in your face!

638
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,598
You're always with the drama.

639
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:48,226
Confess already, please.
Get it over with!

640
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:54,774
I'm on Prozac.

641
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,610
Oh. Oh, my God.

642
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,154
I been seeing a therapist.

643
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:03,116
Oh, my God.
I think that's great.

644
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,411
I think that's wonderful!
I think that's so gutsy!

645
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,414
- Take it easy.
- But I think that's very wonderful.

646
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:11,582
You'd think I was Hannibal Lecter.

647
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,419
I think it's great.
Psychology doesn't address the soul.

648
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,462
But this is a start.
This is something.

649
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,589
Oh, I'm gonna shut up now.

650
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,633
I'll shut up now.

651
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:22,927
You're the only person who knows.

652
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:26,013
The only reason I'm telling you this
is because you're my wife.

653
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:29,642
You're the only person on this planet
that I'm completely honest with.

654
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,644
Oh, please.

655
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,479
Hey, goddamn it, I'm serious.

656
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,982
If the wrong person finds out,
I get a steel jacket...

657
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,526
...of antidepressant
in the back of the head.

658
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,663
I didn't realize you were so unhappy.

659
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:55,960
I don't know.

660
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,171
My mother...

661
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,214
You told him about your father, right?

662
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:03,176
- Who?
- Your therapist.

663
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:06,679
Yeah. Yeah, I told him.

664
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:10,683
Good. But your mother is the one.

665
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:16,022
I don't know, I just feel like lately
my life's out of balance.

666
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:22,361
Our existence on this earth
is a puzzle.

667
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,323
My own daughter hates me.

668
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:28,201
She doesn't hate you, Carm.

669
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,203
We were best friends.

670
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:33,664
Mothers and their daughters.
She'll come back to you.

671
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,879
- Hello?
- Jesus!

672
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:42,048
What's the matter, no social life?

673
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,716
Blow me.

674
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,344
Dad.

675
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:49,889
I brought you my primavera.
It's your favorite.

676
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,892
- Who is it?
- Christopher.

677
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,520
- Hey.
- Our friend is back in town.

678
00:46:55,729 --> 00:47:00,525
"Little Pussy" Malanga,
confused with "Big Pussy" Bompensiero...

679
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,610
...had just returned from Florida...

680
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,862
So it's gonna go down soon?

681
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,073
Don't worry.
I got a way to put it to bed.

682
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,535
Come on, Meadow.

683
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,080
- Go, Falcons!
- Come on, let's go!

684
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,208
So when do you need this by?

685
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:18,876
Right away.

686
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:22,588
- Way to go, Meadow!
- Beautiful, beautiful!

687
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,424
I think I can get a party
like that together.

688
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:29,262
- Side out? That ball hit the line!
- What are you doing, ref?

689
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,142
Mom didn't come?

690
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:37,436
Didn't think you wanted her to.

691
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,772
The car's over there.

692
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,608
Hey, Mr. Dante.
See you, Heather.

693
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,403
You guys played a good game.

694
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:47,446
Heather Dante.
Where'd she get that spike?

695
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:50,408
Don't you think it's
unfair what Mom is doing?

696
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:53,077
Making this little
movie scene out of it.

697
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:57,039
"The Sad Mom Who Can't Even Come
to Her Daughter's Sports Event."

698
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:04,797
Dad?

699
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,466
Don't you think it's
totally out there?

700
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:11,637
I mean, my Aspen trip.
What is she thinking?

701
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,098
Dad?

702
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:22,273
It's been years since I've been here.

703
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:25,067
Dad, please talk to her, please.

704
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,070
God, this is so stupid.

705
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,489
Why are we sitting here?

706
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,369
Your mother thinks you have the
capacity to be a top student.

707
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:36,829
And I agree.

708
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,831
What do you guys want, perfection?

709
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,669
What are you looking at?

710
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:47,673
Your great-grandfather
and his brother Frank...

711
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,176
...they built this place.

712
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,094
Big whoop.

713
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:55,514
Stone and marble workers.
They came over here from Italy...

714
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,517
...and they built this place.

715
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:02,355
Yeah, right. Two guys.

716
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:08,527
No, they were two guys on a crew of,
you know, laborers.

717
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:13,616
They didn't design it...

718
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:16,035
...but they knew how to build it.

719
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:21,374
Now find two guys who can
put decent grout around your bathtub.

720
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,413
So I feel good.

721
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:04,041
So I don't know if I'm
gonna be needing to come back.

722
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,419
It's not the Prozac.

723
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,254
Why not?

724
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:13,592
You said you're thinking clearer and
your wife says you seem to be better?

725
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,929
It's not the medication.

726
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:22,727
Prozac takes weeks to build up
effective levels in the blood.

727
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,604
Well, what is it, then?

728
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:29,066
Coming here. Talking.

729
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:32,778
Hope comes in many forms.

730
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,114
Well, who's got time for that?

731
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,742
What is it you want to say to me?

732
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:49,295
I had a dream last night.

733
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,466
Uh...

734
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:58,012
My bellybutton was...

735
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:01,140
...a Phillips head screw...

736
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:04,310
...and I'm working unscrewing it...

737
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,979
...and when I get it unscrewed...

738
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,484
...my penis falls off.

739
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:20,159
You know, I pick it up and I'm holding
it and I'm running around...

740
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:23,829
...looking for the guy who used to
work on my Lincoln...

741
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:26,499
...so he can put it back on.

742
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,960
And you know, I'm holding it up...

743
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:34,131
...and this bird swoops down
and grabs it in its beak...

744
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,967
...and flies off with it.

745
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,015
What kind of bird?

746
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:47,186
I don't know. Sea gull or something.

747
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,771
A water bird?

748
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:53,067
I saw The Birds last week.
Think that planted the idea?

749
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:55,194
What else is a water bird?

750
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:59,198
Pelican, flamingo.

751
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:01,534
What about ducks?

752
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,000
Those goddamn ducks.

753
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,212
What is it about those ducks
that meant so much to you?

754
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:22,096
I don't know, it was a trip...

755
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:26,684
...having those wild creatures...

756
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:30,896
...come into my pool
and have their little babies.

757
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:39,822
I was sad to see them go.

758
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:44,910
Oh, Jesus, fuck. Now he's gonna cry.

759
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,421
Shit. Fuck me.

760
00:52:55,630 --> 00:53:00,759
When the ducks gave birth to those
babies, they became a family.

761
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:06,640
You're right.

762
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,935
It's a link. A connection.

763
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:13,731
I'm afraid I'm gonna
lose my family...

764
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,900
...like I lost the ducks.

765
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:20,905
That's what I'm full of dread about.

766
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:24,575
It's always with me.

767
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:27,119
What are you so afraid's
going to happen?

768
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,872
I don't know.

769
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:37,379
You work so hard.

770
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:41,967
You work so damn hard
and to see your life's dream...

771
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:45,095
...burn down.

772
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:48,265
Look at it this way,
you collect the insurance.

773
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:51,602
You gotta say to yourself,
"It could have been worse."

774
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:55,522
How could it have been worse?
Fucking faulty stove!

775
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:58,817
Suppose people stopped coming,
ever think of that?

776
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,155
I don't know.
I don't know what the fuck.

777
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,826
He's right.
There's no insurance for that.

778
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:12,706
Why would people stop coming to the
restaurant? It's just catching on.

779
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:16,168
You know what I'm
figuring out lately?

780
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:19,296
Talking helps.

781
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,632
- That's right.
- He's right. He's right.

782
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:28,347
Hope... comes in many forms.

783
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,182
Absolutely.

784
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:31,850
Come on.

785
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,062
Here, hold this.

786
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:36,563
Artie.

787
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:38,857
Artie, come on.

788
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,192
Hey, hey.

789
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,861
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

790
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,531
I'll always help you.

791
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:48,200
Come on. Come on.

792
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,333
Go cook. Hey, let him cook.
He'll feel better.

793
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:12,224
Someday I'll tell him
we torched the restaurant.

794
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:20,399
All right, enough of this shit.
What's wrong?

795
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,402
You know, a simple...

796
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:27,489
..."Way to go, Chris, on the Triborough
Towers contract!" would have been nice.

797
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,074
That's it.

798
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,626
You're right.

799
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,503
You're right.

800
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:44,131
I have no defense.

801
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:49,136
That's how I was parented.
Never supported. Never complimented.

802
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:51,555
My cousin Gregory's girlfriend...

803
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:54,933
...is what they call a development
girl, out in Hollywood.

804
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,895
She said I could sell my life story,
make fucking millions.

805
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:00,898
I didn't do that.
I stuck it out with you.

806
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:04,943
I'll fucking kill you.
Are you gonna go Henry Hill on me now?

807
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,280
You know how many mobsters are selling
screenplays and screwing things up?

808
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,657
She said I could maybe
even play myself.

809
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,451
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

810
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:20,626
Forget Hollywood screenplays.
Forget those distractions, huh?

811
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:24,171
What, you think I haven't had offers?

812
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:29,802
We got work to do. New avenues.

813
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:34,181
Everything's gonna be all right
from here on in. Come on.

814
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:38,811
Look, it's a beautiful day.
What could be bad?

815
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:44,650
It's nice of you to pick me up
for the party, Junior.

816
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:48,946
- At least somebody cares about me.
- These kids today.

817
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:52,658
I suppose he thinks once he's
got me in a nursing home...

818
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:57,663
...I'll die faster and then
he won't have to drive me anywhere.

819
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:00,082
If his father was still alive...

820
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:05,087
...you can bet he'd show more
decency and respect for his mother.

821
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:08,382
Well, my brother John
was a man among men.

822
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,218
He was a saint.

823
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:15,180
Lots of things are different now
from Johnny's and my day.

824
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:16,515
What do you mean?

825
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:19,226
I'm not free to run my business
like I want.

826
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:20,853
Aw, isn't that awful.

827
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,896
Just this week, your son
stuck his hand in...

828
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:25,315
...and made it 100 times
more difficult for me.

829
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:27,609
Plus, he thumbs his nose at New York.

830
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:32,197
What are you gonna do?
He's part of a whole generation.

831
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:36,160
Do you remember the crazy hair?
And the dope?

832
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:37,703
Now it's fags in the military.

833
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:40,747
Stop it, Junior.
You're making me very upset!

834
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,251
I don't like to, Livia,
but I'm agita all the time.

835
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:48,213
And I'll tell you something else,
things are down all across the board.

836
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,757
A lot of friends of ours
are complaining.

837
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:54,511
We used to be recession-proof.
No more.

838
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:58,265
You can't blame it all
on the Justice Department.

839
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,643
Our friends say to me...

840
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:06,565
..."Junior, why don't you
take a larger hand in things?"

841
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:12,905
Something may have to be done, Livia,
about Tony.

842
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,157
I don't know.

843
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,541
There they are.
Hey, Ma, Uncle Jun.

844
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:29,588
You're using mesquite.
That makes the sausage taste peculiar.

845
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:33,300
- Hi, Grandma.
- Happy birthday, my big boy.

846
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:34,927
Carmela, my mother's here.

847
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,679
Everybody, let's eat.

847
00:58:38,305 --> 00:59:38,861

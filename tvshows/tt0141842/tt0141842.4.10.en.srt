00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,866
<i>- There ain't no bear back there.
- Felas!</i>

3
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:57,145
<i>Wel, the way l feel right now,
l'd like to meet a bear.</i>

4
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,377
<i>What would you do if you did meet him?</i>

5
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,717
<i>That bear would have just as much chance
as this pork chop.</i>

6
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:09,793
<i>Where you boys al going? lt ain't over.</i>

7
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:15,623
<i>Somebody's going to get something
they ain't expecting.</i>

8
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,178
<i>Have a bite.</i>

9
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,165
<i>Look out, here he comes!</i>

10
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,440
Where's Furio?

11
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,811
He couldn't get a flight out of Rome,
so I'm driving again today.

12
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,214
Come on in, he'll be right down.

13
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,127
No coffee. I gotta go. Okay?

14
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:29,871
- What did you do to your hair?
- I cut it. What do you think?

15
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:34,403
I thought we agreed that you'd talk to me
before doing something to your hair.

16
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,615
What do you think of it?

17
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,319
- It's short.
- Good, he eats his carrots.

18
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,958
- Makes you look younger.
- Benny's waiting for you.

19
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,493
All right. Well, here.

20
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,292
<i>You fat honey dripper.</i>

21
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:59,461
<i>Come up with the rest of our money,
or l'l strip the lard off your ugly...</i>

22
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,268
<i>Pretty.</i>

23
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,952
Cosette? Come on, Mommy.

24
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,310
Let's go for a walk.

25
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,524
- Where's the dog?
- You shut the TV?

26
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,029
Where's the dog?

27
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,297
Oh, my God! Cosette.

28
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,666
- What?
- Christopher!

29
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,336
She's not breathing. Her neck feels broken.

30
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,636
What the fuck?

31
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,734
Oh, my God, she's dead!

32
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,878
- I fell asleep.
- What?

33
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:47,148
She must've crawled under there for warmth.

34
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,085
Are you fucking crazy?

35
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,450
You fucking killed her!

36
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:54,391
- I didn't kill her. I must have sat on her.
- Jesus.

37
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,222
- My poor baby.
- I'm sorry.

38
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,558
It was an accident, for Christ's sake.

39
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:05,162
How long have I said
she shouldn't be on the furniture?

40
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,968
It's because you were
fucking high, Christopher.

41
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,705
You and your fucking smack! Fuck!

42
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:13,939
Lifestyle.

43
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:17,781
- I'll get you another dog.
- I don't want another dog!

44
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,753
- Four in the side.
- One up the ass.

45
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,998
So nobody's heard from Ralph?

46
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,858
I'm starting to worry.

47
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,603
- I'll call him again.
- Try the gay man's choir.

48
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,336
I read they were having tryouts today.

49
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,641
Three ball, far corner.

50
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,068
Son of a bitch.

51
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,404
Where you been?

52
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:53,252
This was in the mail
for you outside, Tony. UPS.

53
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,754
- What's going on?
- He's calling Ralph.

54
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,121
<i>Leave a message
and leave your phone number.</i>

55
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,286
<i>With my schedule,
l cannot look up phone numbers.</i>

56
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,424
Answering machine, again.

57
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,225
You're up, T.

58
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,961
How you doing? Feeling all right?

59
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,794
Me? Yeah, great.

60
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:22,706
Fuck.

61
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,416
What's that, Ton'?

62
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,818
That's Tony and Ralph's horse, Pie-O-My.

63
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,583
Where you going? Your shot.

64
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,690
What are you doing?

65
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,126
That's a forfeit. That's our money.

66
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,807
<i>- Bing.
- Get rid of that fucking picture.</i>

67
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,643
<i>- What? You don't want to...
- You hear me? Burn it!</i>

68
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,750
I never want to see the fucking thing again!

69
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:23,697
What?

70
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,155
What's with Ralph?
Fucking Bermuda Triangle?

71
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,532
This shit with his kid.
He's probably down in the bunker.

72
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,231
I'll tell you. If I didn't know better...

73
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,706
- We're off the record here, Albert.
- We're off the record?

74
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:00,509
It's Tony.

75
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,477
What? Am I wrong?

76
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:07,985
Honestly? I don't know.

77
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:11,955
Take a leak.

78
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,460
This is bad, my friend.
I mean, don't get me wrong.

79
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:24,094
I wouldn't piss on this Ralph
if he was on fire.

80
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,298
But to whack the guy over a horse?
How fucked up is that?

81
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:30,137
If it can happen to him,
it can happen to any of us.

82
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,973
What's next? You get clipped
for wearing the wrong shoes?

83
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:36,879
What can you do? Tony's the boss.
Centuries of tradition here.

84
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,711
Exactly my point. If Tony did do this...

85
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,553
whack Ralph over a fucking horse...

86
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,989
that guy would be the first guy on line
to pull his fucking plug.

87
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:13,645
I think Justin recognized me
a few minutes ago.

88
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,250
Thank you.

89
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,136
Come in, he's getting dressed.

90
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,129
I'll wait in the car.

91
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,110
Well, welcome back.

92
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,769
I bring presents.

93
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:44,177
Really? That is so sweet.

94
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:48,984
Also, for the grownups,
I bring some of my uncle's wine...

95
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:50,819
but it's come later.

96
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,949
I just made some coffee. Are you sure?

97
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,016
Thank you, but I wait in the car.

98
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,411
What's the matter with you?

99
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,186
I'm sad for my father.

100
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,589
All right, but you gotta get over it.

101
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,232
So I unwrap the paper...

102
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,192
and there she is...

103
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:14,033
with her head held high
and her ears perked up.

104
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,174
And there I am smiling.

105
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,245
What happened then?

106
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,812
Still, I gotta be the sad clown.

107
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:28,786
A front for my friends, my family.

108
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,849
You know, a brave front.

109
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,757
I've heard you describe yourself this way.

110
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,523
The sad clown.

111
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,464
I've never seen it.

112
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:42,465
Carmela also painted
a very different picture.

113
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:43,966
What do you mean?

114
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,800
Volatile, punching the walls.

115
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:50,073
Compulsive gorging on food.

116
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:55,278
Kind of a far cry from the seltzer bottle
and bicycle horn.

117
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,879
I'm sorry.

118
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:00,380
Maybe you'd like Carmela to be here,
if I'm so fucking obnoxious.

119
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:04,082
What I'm trying to establish
is your response to sadness...

120
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,316
is usually rage, not humor.

121
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:10,326
You two don't have to trouble yourselves.
Because I doubled my dosage.

122
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:13,932
I don't want you
taking 80 milligrams of Prozac.

123
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,763
You kick it up to 80 for a week, 10 days...

124
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:20,001
just to pull back on the stick,
get the nose up...

125
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:24,103
then you duck back down to 40
before the limp dick thing sets in.

126
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,704
One: That's ineffective.

127
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,741
Two: It's not a treatment for grief.

128
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,448
Let's get back to Pie-O-My.

129
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,323
It's sad that you've lost something
that you love.

130
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,387
That being said...

131
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,859
- it is a horse.
- What the fuck is the matter with you?

132
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:49,128
The only other time you've become
this emotional in here...

133
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,902
- it was those ducks.
- That was a whole different thing.

134
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,601
- They were ducks.
- Is it different?

135
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,710
You haven't grieved in this way for people.

136
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,109
Your mother, your best friend.

137
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:06,777
Can't I just be sad for a horse
without some touchy-feely...

138
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,619
Freudian shit component to it?

139
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:13,285
When it was the ducks,
it embodied feelings of dread...

140
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:16,624
about your family, that something terrible
was going to happen.

141
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:18,629
It's just the miserable way she died.

142
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:22,463
It just makes me wonder
what kind of fucking toilet world we live in.

143
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,526
A friend of the family, little boy...

144
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:28,164
gets shot with an arrow,
cuts off the flow of blood to his brain.

145
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,140
Thirteen years old.

146
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,042
He's going to live,
but he's never gonna be right.

147
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,612
- How awful for the parents.
- Yeah.

148
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,616
My nephew.
I love that kid like I love my son.

149
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,857
But I think he's got a drug problem, heroin.

150
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:51,489
It kills me just to say it, because I got
so many hopes tied up in this kid.

151
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,197
This is Christopher?

152
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:56,462
This 9l11 shit, I don't know.
The shit that's going on everywhere.

153
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,333
It's like some fucking asshole
is stalking the human race.

154
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:03,068
Anthony, do any of your associates
think about any of this?

155
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,506
I don't know, we don't talk about it.

156
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:18,852
I know it's fucking ridiculous, but I feel like
the reverend Rodney King Jr., you know?

157
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:22,291
- "Why can't we all just get along?"
- What's ridiculous about it?

158
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,660
Come on, don't jerk me off.
This is me you're talking to.

159
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:30,998
You've caused much suffering yourself,
haven't you?

160
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,535
My wife prays to God.

161
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,544
What kind of God does this shit?

162
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,448
How about Carmine Lupertazzi?

163
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:53,321
Christopher ever talk about a dinner
with him and Tony last July?

164
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,157
What's the matter, Adriana?

165
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,560
You and Christopher arguing?

166
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,626
It's a stressful time, right before a wedding.

167
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,732
A lot of guys get cold feet.

168
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:06,635
He's fucking stoned on H all the time, okay?

169
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,407
There, you happy?

170
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,173
We put you guys
on the mailing list for Hazelden.

171
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,474
That rehab shit?

172
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:18,209
That's where all the brochures
are coming from? From you?

173
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,344
Convince him he needs help,
that he should be in rehab.

174
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,223
Look at you, with that little face.

175
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:44,840
These flat screens,
I'll tell you, no glare, high definition.

176
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,912
<i>I was watching On the Waterfront
down at Sears.</i>

177
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,313
Karl Malden's nose hairs
looked like fucking BX cables.

178
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,447
Voice mail again.

179
00:15:57,356 --> 00:16:00,348
Chrissy, we're down here
waiting for the TVs.

180
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,518
Let me ask you something.

181
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:06,223
The other day, T with that picture...

182
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,330
he looked like he was going to cry.

183
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,338
Still no word from Ralph.

184
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,405
Where the fuck is this kid?

185
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,023
What you want around here?

186
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,662
- Can you do an eighth of scag?
- $500.

187
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,126
Yeah, wrap it up.

188
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:46,698
- Get the fuck out the car, bitch!
- Motherfucker, you know who I am?

189
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,463
Who the fuck is this?

190
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,639
You know who the fuck I'm with?

191
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:57,204
You ain't no fucking cop, that's for sure.

192
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:02,350
- The fuck you going to do with that?
- Stick it up your mother's twat!

193
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:13,931
Goddamn it!

194
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,126
What?

195
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:20,563
Little piece of shit.
The cork, it got stuck in the bottle.

196
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,731
Homemade crap.

197
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:26,244
That somebody cared enough about to carry
all the way from the old country for you.

198
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,444
What a fucking week.

199
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:35,885
I talked to Ronnie, asked her
if she's even heard from Ralph.

200
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:40,022
Little fucking kid's
got a respiratory infection now.

201
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,519
She just heard about Pie-O-My,
she's sick about it.

202
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,461
Hello? We're talking about Justin here.

203
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:54,000
Sorry, I was thinking about my mother,
her skin condition.

204
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,079
Oh, my God. Did I forget to take that out?

205
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,742
What's wrong with you?

206
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,021
Really, Ma. Dad's right.

207
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,019
It's not a bad drive.
It's interstate up to Boston.

208
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:17,620
If you don't want to accompany me, fine.
Your sister can come up from Florida.

209
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:20,927
Come on, she's not going to do that.
Of course I'll go.

210
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,361
Did she tell you, Hugh? My horse died.

211
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,202
Pie-O-My?

212
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:29,804
That's too bad.

213
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,275
- God, this wine.
- There was a fire at the stables.

214
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:36,108
She had to be destroyed.
You should've seen her.

215
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,416
String beans, Hugh?

216
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,388
- Baby, what happened?
- He got jacked by some spics.

217
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:52,029
- They took his ride, his fucking watch, too.
- Jesus Christ, the Cartier?

218
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,932
- Christopher, you're bleeding.
- Stop touching it.

219
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,806
- Do you think I could get some money?
- What?

220
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,839
- Who are you?
- Eddie.

221
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:09,146
- From down the park.
- He's good people, Adriana.

222
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:12,342
I took him home. He was all fucked up,
but I straightened him out.

223
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:13,850
He owes me $30.

224
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,977
- Get the fuck out of here.
- What?

225
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:18,856
Get out of my house.

226
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:23,220
- Don't stiff me on this, man.
- Get out!

227
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,596
What's the matter with you?
The guy's my friend.

228
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,133
That's your friend?

229
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:39,108
- Hazelden? What's this?
- It came for you in the mail.

230
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,236
Recovery?

231
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,912
You put me on mailing lists
for junkies, now?

232
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,114
Where do you get your balls?

233
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:10,469
- What are you doing?
- What? Sil said torch it.

234
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:18,246
A classy piece like this?
Horse with the trees, wooden frame?

235
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,247
$25,000 to $30,000 at a minimum.

236
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,949
I think it was Tony said
he wanted it burnt, Paulie, specifically.

237
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,353
- Put it in my car, I'll take it home.
- All right.

238
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:31,257
It'd be an honor to hang this picture
in my house.

239
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,990
Tony, can you come down here, please?

240
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,696
What's the matter?

241
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,704
- What happened?
- Your nephew.

242
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,780
Christopher did this? He hit you?

243
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,475
What for?

244
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,747
- What's the difference?
- He was high.

245
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:59,280
Little prick, I'm going to wring
his fucking neck. Where is he?

246
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:01,588
He's been using drugs. Heroin.

247
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,763
<i>- Who's this?
- You caled me, maricon.</i>

248
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:12,303
<i>- Where's Christopher, asshole?
- Fuck your mother.</i>

249
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:16,467
His car was stolen by some Puerto Ricans.
They took his cell phone, too.

250
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,503
I don't know what to do.

251
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:21,204
I already packed a suitcase
for my aunt's in Daytona.

252
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,942
Take it easy.
Don't do something you'll regret.

253
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:26,041
Three weeks before their wedding.

254
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,348
Maybe he needs to be in rehab.

255
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,685
You can hire someone
to do an intervention, apparently.

256
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:34,157
Girls, come on. We're a family here.

257
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,194
Now I gotta spell it out for you?

258
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,732
Take it easy.
Let me figure out how to handle this.

259
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,033
Please, don't hurt him.

260
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,597
<i>...fight plan wil win out.</i>

261
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:22,202
<i>At this stage the fight
is getting closer because...</i>

262
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,878
Why am I always having to come here?

263
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:38,688
- How are you doing, man?
- Did we come at a bad time?

264
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,482
The decorating ideas.

265
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:43,617
You want to come in?

266
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,799
I'm sorry for the mess.

267
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,264
Please, this is nothing.

268
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:56,565
<i>So, there is a page from Metropolitan Home.</i>

269
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:01,306
Now, wait till you see how
a mirrored backsplash can amplify a room.

270
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,876
You want something? Something to drink?

271
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,111
We gotta go.

272
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,283
If you've got a cup of coffee.

273
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,862
<i>- He loved that little man, by the way.
- Gobbetto.</i>

274
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,490
He's good luck.

275
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:24,092
Not that he remembered to thank you.
And Meadow loved that book.

276
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:29,034
You know, I feel bad.
I didn't give you something.

277
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:33,040
I bring something,
but I forgot it when I left that morning.

278
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:41,079
Balsamic vinegar, 35 years.
From my sister's husband's family.

279
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,110
Live in Modena.

280
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,561
So, aside from your Dad...

281
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:55,598
- was it wonderful being back in Italy?
- It was wonderful, yeah.

282
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:59,293
Go home and see your friends, your family.

283
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,035
I gotta be honest...

284
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,475
it was not so nice.

285
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,970
- I don't belong there no more.
- No?

286
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:09,712
Something change.

287
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:13,048
- Maybe me.
- What do you mean?

288
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:17,177
I'm like a visitor in my own town.

289
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,417
Life went on without me.

290
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,625
There is nothing there for me now.

291
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:26,391
- No special someone?
- I feel strange to live here also.

292
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,598
Maybe I should never have come to America.

293
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:33,263
You've made such a nice life
for yourself, though.

294
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:35,101
You've got a wonderful home.

295
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:36,902
- A girlfriend.
- No.

296
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,205
What do you mean, no? Jessica?

297
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:44,839
I try to talk to her...

298
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:48,015
but there is no communication.

299
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:51,654
Like with some people,
you know what I mean?

300
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,054
<i>- That's what love is built on.
- Sל.</i>

301
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,230
So why did you come back?

302
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:09,129
You said you'd take me to CompUSA
so I could get a new Magic Stick.

303
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:10,367
And I will.

304
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,740
I got stuff to do. I told you.

305
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:17,972
I'd better get going.

306
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,275
Thank you very much for the vinegar.

307
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:44,301
Where's Branca? She jump ship already?

308
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:48,009
She's in hospital for a while. Cyst.

309
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,982
Where's the old fart? I gotta talk to him.

310
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,413
It's his afternoon nap.
You want me to wake him?

311
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:00,749
Give him a while.

312
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,626
Want some wine?
From Furio's uncle in Italy?

313
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:15,629
He says they had a lot of sun in this year.

314
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:17,842
<i>Salute.</i>

315
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,882
It needs ice.

316
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:33,549
I'm going to watch the Bloomberg.

317
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:45,460
- What's all that?
- I'm making a website for my business.

318
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:48,932
You know how to do that?

319
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,271
I'm going to pay somebody...

320
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:55,075
$35 an hour? I stuck, I call Bill.

321
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:58,378
You got married yet?

322
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:02,075
Maybe when he gets back
from Port St. Lucie.

323
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:05,412
The baseball spring training for his Mets.

324
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:10,456
That Bill's a lucky man.

325
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:16,366
You Russians, you got all the angles,
you come over here, you bust your ass.

326
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:17,833
People are people.

327
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:23,732
Look at you.
You got every excuse to be in the bottle...

328
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:26,537
and here you are designing websites.

329
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,613
What do you mean? What excuse?

330
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,815
- Your...
- No, what?

331
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,645
Come on, you know, that...

332
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:39,383
My leg.

333
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:41,756
Of course.

334
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,458
I don't think of it right away.

335
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:50,223
There are worse things.

336
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:52,895
<i>...digital countdown timer
with automatic shut-off.</i>

337
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:55,997
<i>Simply put your food in
and set the timer, walk away.</i>

338
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:58,702
<i>Your new George Foreman Gril
wil tel you exactly...</i>

339
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,507
<i>when your food is griled to perfection.</i>

340
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,905
<i>This gril does al the work for you.</i>

341
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:07,782
<i>With my exclusive 20-minute
digital countdown timer with auto...</i>

342
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,653
Heroin, you got only one option.

343
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:15,249
A dog you love catches rabies,
you put her out of its misery, Anthony.

344
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:19,686
<i>Salute.</i>

345
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,205
So what do I do, Uncle Jun'?

346
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:36,907
The feds get him in his condition,
who knows what he's liable to say.

347
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,808
You go on trial, like me,
you won't sleep at night.

348
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,079
All the more reason to clean him up.

349
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,548
Still, he's...

350
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:51,319
He's a major liability.
If it were anybody else...

351
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,597
It reminds me of people's feet.

352
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:03,838
I don't know if I can do that other thing.

353
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:06,602
Dominic Palladino, do you remember him?

354
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:09,647
- B&E guy, a real juicer.
- He's in AA now.

355
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:12,575
I thought maybe I'd give him a call.

356
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,451
They can treat this shit nowadays.

357
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,081
Me with the competency hearings.
You with the head shrinkers.

358
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,589
This one in rehab now.

359
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:30,094
I was so upset when he didn't bring me
a present back from Italy.

360
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,363
He got something for A.J. And for Meadow.

361
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:36,202
He gave me some vinegar,
but I don't think it was meant for me.

362
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,572
It must've meant something, that he felt bad.

363
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:41,203
Carmela, you sound like you're 15 years old.

364
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,543
I say I'm helping him decorate.

365
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,140
I bring A.J. With me.
Now even he smells a rat.

366
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:50,952
If Tony suspects one iota,
you know what'll happen to Furio.

367
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:54,014
These guys are living in a different century.

368
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:56,853
- It didn't stop you.
- Steve at the gym?

369
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:01,395
I felt so guilty all the time.
The lies and the sneaking.

370
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:05,093
It took Jackie going in the hospital
to get me to stop.

371
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:09,500
- We haven't slept together yet.
- You're not fucking him?

372
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,067
So this isn't really real.

373
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,338
It is real.

374
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:16,970
We communicate.

375
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,816
He looks at me like I'm beautiful.

376
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:22,578
He thinks I'm interesting when I talk.

377
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:27,023
Just those few minutes
when we see each other, I live for those.

378
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:32,557
I feel like my life is slipping through
my fingers and I will never be happy.

379
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,629
If you haven't slept with him yet, don't.

380
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:37,894
And don't go over there anymore.

381
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,047
We're all here?

382
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:56,645
Good afternoon.

383
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:59,281
For those of you who don't know me,
I am Dominic...

384
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,291
and I'm an alcoholic and an addict.

385
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,224
Don't forget "scumbag. "

386
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:06,420
As some of you obviously don't know...

387
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:09,364
I've also been in recovery now
going on four years.

388
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:13,235
I joined AA in prison,
and frankly, it saved my life.

389
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:18,301
Okay, now, we're all here today
because we have one thing in common.

390
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,743
Not only do we share
a certain background and culture...

391
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:25,374
we care about Chris and want to help him
with his heroin addiction.

392
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:29,210
Any one of you been involved
in an intervention before?

393
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:40,595
Caught our daughter
smoking pot once, but...

394
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,496
- Not really, no.
- No problem.

395
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,692
An intervention
is a non-judgmental confrontation.

396
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,369
A "care-frontation," we call it.

397
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:53,242
Now, what I need from you guys
is to make a list of specific times...

398
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:56,109
where Christopher's drug use
impacted on you directly.

399
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,484
For example, Adriana, is it?

400
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,519
You would say something like this:

401
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,921
"Christopher, last Monday you came home
from work high...

402
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:10,119
"and belligerent,
and you were physically abusive to me. "

403
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:13,526
What if he's high when we try to talk to him?

404
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,258
Then we wait till he's sober.

405
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,927
My first intervention, Steven Patrano
waited 10 hours for me to sober up.

406
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:22,461
- Your first intervention?
- In 1997, I suffered a relapse.

407
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:26,906
As in heroin addiction, alcoholics
suffer a fairly high recidivism rate.

408
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:30,510
Great. So he's taking advice
from a two-time loser.

409
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,544
There are no losers in recovery.

410
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:37,544
Actually, I never really met Ralph's kid.

411
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:40,389
I saw him once from a distance, though.

412
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:41,886
Handsome boy.

413
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:46,864
He's got a long struggle ahead of him,
that's for sure.

414
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:48,789
Doctors, rehab...

415
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,094
physical therapy...

416
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:56,901
I think I'm going to have
the medallions of veal.

417
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,853
You make me late for a table
at Tavern on the fucking Green?

418
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,825
How's the real estate business?

419
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:17,690
- Excuse me?
- You know, HUD.

420
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:21,090
Garside Street, you, Ralph, Zellman.

421
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,198
Zellman tell you this?

422
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,404
Carmine doesn't know anything
about this yet.

423
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:31,699
I'm giving you an opportunity to cut a deal,
make it right.

424
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:35,644
Last time, Frelinghuysen Avenue, I cut you
in out of friendship, but that's over.

425
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:38,375
You got nothing coming to you.
You or Carmine.

426
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:42,150
You sure you want to go down this road?

427
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:04,506
How much to paint a different suit on him,
change his face a little?

428
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:06,805
- Pardon me?
- Why throw it away?

429
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,137
A stronger chin, maybe.

430
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:12,110
I was thinking like those paintings
in the courthouse.

431
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:15,983
Something classy, you know,
like a Revolutionary War general.

432
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,845
Napoleon and his horse. That kind of thing.

433
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,858
He's rather portly to be Napoleon.

434
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,957
Not Napoleon, exactly.

435
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:26,058
Like Napoleon.

436
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,024
Sit down. Relax.

437
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:37,836
What's going on, Ton'?

438
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,808
I think I know what happened to Ralph,
and if I'm right...

439
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,605
he ain't coming back.

440
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,313
- It was New York.
- Johnny Sack?

441
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,656
What was it? The fat joke?

442
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,821
I'm sure that didn't help.

443
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,318
Carmine.

444
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,224
This HUD thing we're into,
they wanted a piece of it.

445
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:03,324
I think they confronted Ralph...

446
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:06,334
- things went sour.
- What'd he say, John?

447
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:09,098
Wasn't what he said so much
as what he didn't say.

448
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:11,004
We're talking about New York here.

449
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:13,976
Before we do anything
in terms of a payback...

450
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,336
you go to your people.

451
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,346
I want a full investigation.

452
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,109
Nobody makes a move
until we know what happened.

453
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:23,784
You understand?

454
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:29,755
What the fuck?

455
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:35,331
- What's going on?
- Have a seat.

456
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:40,168
I'm Dominic.
I know you don't know me, but...

457
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:43,396
You're the guy who broke into
Stew Leonard's that time.

458
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,408
You stole all those pork loins.

459
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:49,007
Yeah, but that's not why I'm here today.

460
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:53,607
- We're here to talk about your drug problem.
- What?

461
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:58,353
- Jesus Christ, you fucking kidding me?
- Sorry, baby, please.

462
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,157
No, fuck this shit.

463
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,486
You were told once. Now, sit down.

464
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:06,491
Sit down.

465
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:21,609
Ma? Jesus.

466
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,351
This won't be easy for any of us.

467
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:34,289
But I want you to know that we're here today
because we care about you.

468
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:38,251
- What was this, your idea?
- All we ask is that you listen.

469
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:43,425
Adriana, you want to begin?

470
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,869
"Christopher, I love you very much.

471
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:56,547
"My only dream is that
we have a happy life together.

472
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:00,009
"The last few months,
things have got very bad with us...

473
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:02,517
"because of you using drugs all the time.

474
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:06,717
- "You're high all the time and I can't take it. "
- Be specific, hon.

475
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:13,054
"When we first started going out,
we made love all the time.

476
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:17,291
- "Now, because of the drugs... "
- Jesus, is this fucking necessary?

477
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,392
Go ahead.

478
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:21,737
"... you can no longer function as a man.

479
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:27,035
"Last week when I came home
to learn that you had killed our dog...

480
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:28,941
"that was the final straw. "

481
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:33,916
You killed the dog? What'd you do that for?

482
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:36,411
- It was an accident.
- Was it barking?

483
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:38,921
He sat on her while he was high.

484
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,691
- Jesus Christ.
- I fell asleep.

485
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:44,251
She got suffocated or something.

486
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,130
Are you done, Adriana?

487
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:55,605
You killed little Cosette?

488
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:58,198
I ought to suffocate you, you little prick!

489
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,106
Tony, we're going in order.

490
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,404
"When I came in to open up one morning...

491
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:08,077
"you had your head half in the toilet.
Your hair was in the toilet water.

492
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:10,786
- "Disgusting. "
- I told you, I had the flu.

493
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:13,923
- I said my piece.
- Great, I can't even defend myself, now?

494
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:16,960
- No one's attacking you.
- It doesn't change anything.

495
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:20,998
But I can verify that he was sick
for a little while.

496
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:24,434
This thing with the dog.
How could you not see it on the chair?

497
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:25,867
You're getting emotional.

498
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:28,803
That's because I know what it's like
to lose a pet!

499
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,968
I happen to know that you were high
at my mother-in-law's wake.

500
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:40,479
You were talking non-stop for 20 minutes,
nothing but gibberish.

501
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,378
My mother's wake.

502
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,385
Jesus Christ.

503
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:53,989
- You want to read your statement?
- I don't write nothing down.

504
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:56,192
So I'll keep this short and sweet.

505
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,461
You're weak. You're out of control.

506
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:01,605
You've become an embarrassment
to yourself and everybody else.

507
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,572
- Listen to you.
- Guys.

508
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,405
We said "non-judgmental. "

509
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:08,975
Fuck that. Let him take his medicine.

510
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:11,706
Seriously, you want to talk
about fucking up?

511
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,578
- Watch it, Chrissy.
- What?

512
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:15,615
I thought we're being honest here.

513
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:19,779
You got some balls, you know that.
All of you.

514
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,423
You want to talk about self-control,
how about you, Sil?

515
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:28,359
Fucking every slut working in the place
when you got a wife and kids.

516
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:31,496
Or you, Paulie.

517
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:34,367
Remember last winter in the woods
with the Russian guy?

518
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:35,871
I am warning you!

519
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,306
There he goes, Mr. Type A personality.

520
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,106
We're talking about
you killing yourself with drugs!

521
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:42,668
Not my fucking personality!

522
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,681
- Right.
- I'm going to kill myself?

523
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:47,582
The way you eat,
you'll have a heart attack before you're 50.

524
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:49,812
- Sit down.
- You're talking to the boss.

525
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,913
Good, maybe someone will smack
some goddamn sense into him!

526
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,823
Great, my own mother.
Fuck you, you fucking whore!

527
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:57,991
Son of a bitch!

528
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:01,962
Guys, please!

529
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:03,465
Come on!

530
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:05,090
Stop it!

531
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:13,901
Excuse me. How's he doing?

532
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:16,036
I'm a relative.

533
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:19,480
He slipped off the kitchen counter
spraying for ants?

534
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,141
He was wearing socks.

535
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:25,251
- Are you aware that he has a drug problem?
- Really?

536
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:30,790
The man has a hairline skull fracture.
We'll admit him, keep him overnight.

537
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,888
One minute.

538
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,261
Give us a minute, okay?

539
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:51,381
Does it hurt?

540
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,476
They gave me some aspirin.

541
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:59,181
Enjoy it, because it's the last fucking drug
you'll ever take.

542
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:05,089
- I'm sorry, T.
- Shut the fuck up and listen to me.

543
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:10,065
You're my nephew, Christopher,
and I love you.

544
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,403
That's the only reason
you're alive right now.

545
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,168
If it were anybody else, anybody...

546
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:21,238
they would've had their intervention
through the back of their head.

547
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:24,107
You and me, we're close.

548
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,344
We've done a lot of things for each other.

549
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,386
That cop shot my father.

550
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:33,851
I know what you're telling me,
I'll never forget that.

551
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:35,391
This is how you repay me.

552
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:38,656
I gotta worry if you'll flip
over a nickel bag of white powder.

553
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:41,095
- No, Tony, never.
- You lied to me.

554
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:45,462
I told you, you were the future of this family.
I gave you that responsibility.

555
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:48,596
And you looked me in the eye,
and you accepted it...

556
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,731
and you were fucking high.

557
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:54,873
Shut up.

558
00:41:56,247 --> 00:42:00,308
Tomorrow morning I gotta go with Patsy
up to this rehab place in Pennsylvania.

559
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:02,375
You're going in. You're staying in.

560
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:05,684
You'll go to every session,
and you'll keep your mouth shut.

561
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:08,748
Now, if you need anything, anything at all...

562
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,152
Patsy's going to be
half a mile away from you...

563
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,062
in a motel.

564
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,999
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

565
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:24,297
- Do you understand?
- Tony, I'm sorry!

566
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,710
How did I fucking get to this?

567
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:44,825
- So he comes again.
- Brought some pastries.

568
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,058
- Is he taking a nap?
- Yeah.

569
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:50,894
- Is he driving you to drink?
- I can drive myself.

570
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:15,948
I needed that.

571
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:18,093
What's the matter?

572
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:21,220
Spent a long time in the hospital last night.

573
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,000
The shit that goes on down there.

574
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:30,265
I wasn't expecting visitors.

575
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:46,318
How about those Mets?

576
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,118
Don't start with me and those Mets.

577
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:59,128
You know, I was thinking about you.

578
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,572
- So you're drunk already.
- No.

579
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,437
I was thinking about the way you are.

580
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:08,604
How you always have this little smile,
like you got your own private joke.

581
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:15,348
You don't talk much, do you?

582
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,516
I wish I knew your secret.

583
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:26,791
Lose a leg and start making websites.

584
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:32,466
That's the whole purpose for people
like me, to inspire people like you.

585
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:39,770
- Jesus, no offense.
- That's the trouble with you Americans.

586
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:42,807
You expect nothing bad ever to happen...

587
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,345
when the rest of the world expects
only bad to happen.

588
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:49,716
- They're not disappointed.
- That's a fucking grim outlook.

589
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:53,255
You have everything, and still you complain.

590
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:56,659
You lie on couches
and bitch to your psychiatrist.

591
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:00,486
You got too much time
to think about yourselves.

592
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:02,589
Sounds like me all right.

593
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:05,767
You're not so bad.

594
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:08,832
You have many fine qualities.

595
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:11,734
You are big and strong...

596
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,011
full of life, mischief.

597
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:18,147
I have always feel positive towards you.

598
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:24,584
You should see yourself now...

599
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:29,121
in the shadows there,
with the smoke all around you.

600
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:34,587
You're beautiful.
You remind me of that movie star...

601
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:38,327
- Irina is beautiful.
- Greta Garbo.

602
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,994
- May I help you?
- Yeah.

603
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:47,837
<i>Brad to reception, your 1:00 client is here.</i>

604
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:53,139
You'll call me later?

605
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,111
No phone calls for the first two weeks.
House rules.

606
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,078
I'll write.

607
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:04,519
I was thinking of keeping a journal anyway.

608
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:07,413
Get it published, maybe,
under my pen name.

609
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:13,394
Congratulations.

610
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:18,267
You got here, dude. That's the hardest part.

611
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:22,067
I'm going to have to search your bag.

612
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:31,076
- Cigarettes are okay, right?
- Cigarettes are fine.

613
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:35,642
They're encouraged for patients who smoke.
But, Chris, no chocolate allowed.

614
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:38,583
No caffeine
or substances containing caffeine.

615
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:43,387
All set?

616
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,033
- I love you, baby.
- I love you, too.

617
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,363
When's Bill coming back?

618
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:22,929
Next week.

619
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:27,603
I'll be busy for a few days...

620
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:30,872
but I'll see you when I can.

621
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:33,575
I think it's not a good idea.

622
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:36,577
- What do you mean?
- Maybe I call you.

623
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:39,038
But I don't think so.

624
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:41,982
- You didn't like it?
- I like it very much.

625
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:44,348
But, Tony, come on.

626
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:47,923
You're a nice guy,
but I got my own problems.

627
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:50,289
I don't want all the time prop you up.

628
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:54,661
What, are you fucking kidding me?

629
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:03,805
- What you doing?
- I didn't expect you so soon.

630
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:08,410
Tell my uncle I'll talk to him later.

631
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:26,306
<i>Lowe is not a 98-99 mile an hour guy.</i>

632
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:34,117
<i>Driven out to deep left field!
Giving chase is Henderson, on the run!</i>

633
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,586
<i>See ya! An opposite-field home run...</i>

634
00:51:38,305 --> 00:52:38,508

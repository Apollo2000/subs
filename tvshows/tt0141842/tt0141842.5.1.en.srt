1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,000
# You woke up
this morning #

2
00:00:13,035 --> 00:00:15,465
# Got yourself a gun #

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,600
# Your momma always said
you'd be the Chosen One #

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,000
# She said you're...
you're one in a million #

5
00:00:23,035 --> 00:00:25,265
# You've got
to burn to shine #

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,300
# But you were
born under a bad sign #

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,150
# With a blue moon
in your eyes #

8
00:00:31,185 --> 00:00:33,992
# When you
woke up this morning #

9
00:00:34,027 --> 00:00:36,800
# And all that love
had gone #

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,000
# Your papa never
told you about #

11
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:42,465
# Right and wrong #

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,800
# But you're...
you're lookin' good, baby #

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,200
# I believe that
you're feelin' fine #

14
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,900
# Shame about it,
born under a bad sign #

15
00:00:49,935 --> 00:00:52,365
# With a blue moon
in your eyes #

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,665
- # So sing it now #
- # Woke up this morning #

17
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,300
# Got a blue moon...
got a blue moon in your eyes, yeah #

18
00:00:59,335 --> 00:01:01,300
# Woke up this morning #

19
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,000
# You say you woke up
this morning #

20
00:01:06,035 --> 00:01:08,700
# The world
turned upside down #

21
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,000
# Lordy, well,
things ain't been the same #

22
00:01:11,035 --> 00:01:14,300
# Since the blues
walked in our town #

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,700
# But you're... but you're
one in a million #

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,500
# 'Cause you got that
shotgun shine #

25
00:01:19,535 --> 00:01:22,200
# Shame about it,
born under a bad sign #

26
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,200
# With a blue moon
in your eyes, yeah #

27
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,165
# Woke up
this morning #

28
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,365
- # Uh-huh #
- # And got yourself a gun #

29
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,400
- # Woke up this morning #
- # Got yourself a gun #

30
00:01:34,435 --> 00:01:37,000
- # Uh-huh #
- # Got yourself a gun. #

32
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,100
# Every night
it's the same #

33
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,400
# I hear your heart
turn cold as rain #

34
00:01:54,435 --> 00:01:57,600
# And although
you'll be gone again #

35
00:01:57,635 --> 00:02:01,300
# I hear
the front door close #

36
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,600
# You say you
got to go downtown #

37
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,500
# I guess there's
someone else you found #

38
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,500
# So why you're
still comin' round #

39
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,365
# Heaven only knows #

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,600
# Heaven only
knows just why #

41
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,100
# Lovin' you
should make me cry #

42
00:02:21,135 --> 00:02:24,500
# Make me feel
like I could die #

43
00:02:24,535 --> 00:02:27,867
# That's the way it goes #

44
00:02:27,902 --> 00:02:31,165
# Heaven only ever sees #

45
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,165
# How love's made
a fool of me #

46
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,200
# I guess that's how
it's meant to be #

47
00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:41,200
# But heaven only knows. #

48
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,400
AJ!

49
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,600
Jesus, Meadow,
chill out!

50
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,300
Inevitably, Sukanya,
what goes in must comes out.

51
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,800
And these people now being released
from prison were jailed

52
00:03:32,835 --> 00:03:35,300
during the big mafia
crackdowns of the 1980s?

53
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,300
Seems like yesterday,
doesn't it?

54
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,000
For years we heard how law enforcement
broke the back of the mob.

55
00:03:41,035 --> 00:03:42,865
Well, they've
served their time.

56
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,100
"It's the old never-ending
battle against crime and corruption,"

57
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,300
- to quote Superman.
- What do you think is gonna happen

58
00:03:49,335 --> 00:03:51,000
with this infusion
of new blood?

59
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,300
We could be looking at a period
of potentially violent struggle.

60
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:57,500
- They gonna paint everythin' the worst.
- How long till dinner?

61
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,500
- Any familiar names?
- In New York, the only old-style boss

62
00:04:00,535 --> 00:04:03,465
still in place
is Carmine Lupertazzi.

63
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,300
He'll soon be rejoined by Angelo Garepe,
his former consigliere.

64
00:04:07,335 --> 00:04:10,200
Also Philip Leotardo,
long-time Lupertazzi captain.

65
00:04:10,235 --> 00:04:12,600
Can you help me here?
Crush some ice?

66
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,500
- I'll be right there.
- New Jersey's a better case in point.

67
00:04:16,535 --> 00:04:18,665
You've got
Michele "Feech" La Manna,

68
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,200
released just this week,
a man greatly feared

69
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,865
- and respected in the '70s.
- Amen to that.

70
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,400
Similar situation with Anthony Blundetto
in that same

71
00:04:26,435 --> 00:04:28,565
- Jersey crime family, the Sopranos.
- Oh!

72
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,500
- Let me see how he looks.
... still is as far as I know.

73
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,365
28 years old when he went away.

74
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,400
A rising star.
Thought to be the central suspect

75
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,100
in the car-bomb killing
of Thomas Gilardi and his driver.

76
00:04:38,135 --> 00:04:40,700
That's the best picture they could find?
He was a fox.

77
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,600
Will you pipe down?
We're tryin' to watch.

78
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,265
It's my house, Tony.

79
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,300
- What are you watching?
- Go call your brother for dinner.

80
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,900
- Bobby!
- Be nice to have him back, huh?

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,465
- Your cousin?
- Missed the shit out of him.

82
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,800
The older you are, the more
you're entitled to eat.

83
00:04:58,835 --> 00:05:00,765
Hi, sorry.

84
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,100
- Where the hell you been?
- Your mother didn't send anything?

85
00:05:04,135 --> 00:05:07,400
She wasn't even home. Her and Aunt Ro
went out to dinner, I think.

86
00:05:07,435 --> 00:05:09,300
Everybody sit!

87
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,765
Now please.

88
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,665
This is great of you,
Aunt Jan,

89
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,800
keeping the Sunday dinner
tradition going.

90
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,765
Can you get the roast
out of the oven?

91
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,700
- Canned clam chowder?
- Go sit, God damn it.

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,100
- Oh, shit.
- What?

93
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,565
My wedding ring.

94
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,665
- Goin' to strap on the bag, Ton'?
- Yeah.

95
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,200
Would you say this is an interesting
point in the history of the mafia?

96
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,600
I'd say we're looking at a great year
for crime reporters, Sukanya.

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,500
- Anthony!
- What?

98
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
I wanna say hello.

99
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,600
Wh... can you stop
a minute?

100
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,965
- How was dinner?
- Fine.

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,465
- What'd you have?
- Roast beef.

102
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,200
Did your father pick up his mail
when he dropped you off?

103
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:34,065
No, he didn't come in.
He was tired.

104
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,900
He said he just wanted to go to bed.
I'm trying to practice.

105
00:06:36,935 --> 00:06:38,700
I see you didn't bring
the power vac in

106
00:06:38,735 --> 00:06:40,200
from the pool house
like I asked.

107
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,165
Why does that even
have to be done?

108
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,665
Grandpa's still gonna
have to lift it into his truck.

109
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,100
I don't want him to have to drag
it from all the way out back.

110
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,800
# It's so nice to have
a man around the house. #

111
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,000
You should've thought
about that before.

112
00:06:56,035 --> 00:06:58,300
What did you say?

113
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,600
Go out and get
that vacuum, now!

114
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:09,100
What did I
just say?! Go!

115
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,100
Mommy!

116
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,300
Oh my God.
Mommy, help!

117
00:07:31,335 --> 00:07:34,700
Mommy! Mom.

118
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,700
Mommy.

119
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,900
AJ, be quiet,
don't move.

120
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,600
Mommy?

121
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,400
Mommy!

122
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,565
Go get Dad's gun!

123
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,500
It's all the way
in the dining room!

124
00:07:54,535 --> 00:07:56,700
Hey, go away! Go!

125
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,200
Hey! Get outta here!

126
00:08:02,235 --> 00:08:05,000
Go!

127
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,600
How's the olive loaf?

128
00:08:20,635 --> 00:08:22,465
You know what I like?

129
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,100
- I like the Gulden's Brown Mustard.
- Are you leaving?

130
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:29,200
Yeah, I got a overseas
call comin' at home.

131
00:08:29,235 --> 00:08:31,200
Finish your sandwich,
at least, first.

132
00:08:31,235 --> 00:08:35,000
- Oh, yeah, yeah, no.
- Sheesh.

133
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,100
Could be the same one
from Willow Drive.

134
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,900
God. The most densely
populated state in the country,

135
00:08:46,935 --> 00:08:49,065
- and still this.
- Gone.

136
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,300
He went through your neighbor's
garbage, though, the Kalcheims?

137
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,900
It's been goin' on all over.
If my son had been alone...

138
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:56,800
You're not gonna
put your trash cans out

139
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,800
until as close
to pick-up time as possible.

140
00:08:58,835 --> 00:09:00,665
- You hear that?
- Put ammonia or bleach

141
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,200
in the container and on the lid.
I posted a notice for your neighbors.

142
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,100
If this had been
a category two,

143
00:09:06,135 --> 00:09:07,900
injury or serious
property damage,

144
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,865
- we could set traps, but not for this.
- God.

145
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,365
You should've busted a cap
in his ass with Dad's rifle.

146
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,500
It's illegal to discharge firearms
within the borough limits.

147
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,300
- You're gonna call Dad, aren't you?
- No.

148
00:09:19,335 --> 00:09:22,000
The great percentage
of them don't come back.

149
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,800
If he does...
call us.

150
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,200
Oh, do you have
bird feed back there?

151
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,100
Ah, duck food,
yes, my husband's.

152
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,200
It's probably what
attracted the animal.

153
00:09:36,235 --> 00:09:38,165
See, the corn's gotten
damp and aromatic.

154
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,100
You might wanna tell
your husband to put it inside.

155
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,100
Right.

156
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,900
Setting up the equipment
is a complicated affair.

157
00:09:47,935 --> 00:09:51,717
Video cameras
with built-in recorders...

158
00:09:51,752 --> 00:09:55,500
- Then the car that he qualifi...
- Hello.

159
00:09:55,535 --> 00:09:57,565
Mmm.

160
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,965
I'm Dr. Lowenstein.

161
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,200
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Go back.
- What?

162
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,200
- Come on.
- You're kidding.

163
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,900
No, go back, please!

164
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,965
- Why don't you come in?
- I like Nolte.

165
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,500
- Why didn't you tell me last night?
- I'm sorry.

166
00:10:12,535 --> 00:10:14,500
That's a long story,
let's just skip it.

167
00:10:14,535 --> 00:10:16,065
I'll try to think
of a better one.

168
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,100
- What's bothering you?
- Global warming, acid rain,

169
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,700
the national debt?
Never even know what's goin' on.

170
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,800
Look at her nails,
totally real.

171
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,300
- You weren't paying attention.
- Let's face it,

172
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,200
women are more
devious than men.

173
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,200
One of my therapists
was a woman.

174
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,300
Too bad you didn't get
all your talkin' done with her.

175
00:10:34,335 --> 00:10:36,400
You expect a man to be
a tower of strength.

176
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,900
Then when it turns out he's got a few
weaknesses and some insecurities,

177
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
what do you do?
You turn around and you betray him!

178
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
So you feel that
your mother betrayed you?

179
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,565
Doggone, I hate
this Freudian crap.

180
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,000
It's not your job to listen
to my problems anyway!

181
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,100
If you don't mind,
I'd like to go.

182
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,400
- You're free to leave anytime you want.
- Good!

183
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,465
Goddamn shrink.

184
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,800
- Who was I kiddin'?
- What are you smiling at?

185
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,965
- I was a champion...
- Nothin', I don't know.

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,300
- You have this goofy look on your face.
- Come on.

187
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:11,000
...until Susan Lowenstein
came along.

188
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,600
Her questions makin' me
as dizzy as her perfume.

189
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,800
- Jennifer Melfi?
- Yes?

190
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So we open
the fuckin' trunk,

191
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,100
this suffocatin'
Russian cocksucker pops up!

192
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,265
He's still alive!

193
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,500
We lead him through the snow.
This asshole's shiverin'...

194
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,400
he's wearin' fuckin' pajamas
and slippers in like 8° weather.

195
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,365
- Hey!
- Ho!

196
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,000
- Here he is.
- How you doin'?

197
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,365
- Fellas?
- The B?

198
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,165
- Hey, Ton'.
- Radio on the way in.

199
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,000
- Another incident at the airport.
- Fuckin' assholes.

200
00:12:19,035 --> 00:12:21,500
I gotta make
a couple calls.

201
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,300
Anyway, he starts
runnin', the Russian.

202
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,000
Boom! I'm tellin' you the top of his
head came off like a fuckin' bad rug.

203
00:12:29,035 --> 00:12:32,800
What a beating we had to give
this prick, ooh Madonn'.

204
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,500
- Where is he now?
- Who the fuck cares, right, Chrissie?

205
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,265
- Who the fuck knows?
- Poor bastard.

206
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,900
Never would've happened if Paulie
hadn't initially overreacted,

207
00:12:40,935 --> 00:12:42,717
but it's one
for the books.

208
00:12:42,752 --> 00:12:44,465
What do you mean
overreacted?

209
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,165
You choked him with the lamp,
Paulie, or we could've got

210
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,265
Silvio shcarole without havin'
to spend the night in the open.

211
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,900
You let him jab you with that shovel
was the problem. Lets his guard down.

212
00:12:53,935 --> 00:12:55,865
We would've caught up
to the prick

213
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,200
- if you didn't lose your fuckin' shoe!
- Wait, you lost your shoe?

214
00:12:59,235 --> 00:13:01,265
You didn't tell us about that.

215
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,300
"Chrissie, please, don't leave
me out here. "

216
00:13:03,335 --> 00:13:05,000
You little cocksucker!

217
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,400
I covered your ass with Tony
about that whole thing,

218
00:13:07,435 --> 00:13:09,667
and never a word
of fuckin' thanks, ever!

219
00:13:09,702 --> 00:13:11,951
Always playin' that
blood-relation card.

220
00:13:11,986 --> 00:13:14,200
- Tony's little favorite.
- Fuck you!

221
00:13:14,235 --> 00:13:17,100
- What?
- Come on! Come on.

222
00:13:17,135 --> 00:13:19,700
What the fuck?

223
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,600
That was a good story,
damn it.

224
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:32,817
Tellin' you right now...

225
00:13:32,852 --> 00:13:35,000
it's finished with us.

226
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,100
- Goodbye, Dr. Melfi.
- See you next week.

227
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,965
- Hello?
- Like the flowers?

228
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And yeah, before you ask,
I am takin' the medication.

229
00:13:51,035 --> 00:13:54,600
How are you, Anthony?
It's been a long time.

230
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:56,900
I'm great,
actually. You?

231
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,250
Thank you for that
beautiful arrangement.

232
00:13:59,285 --> 00:14:01,500
I see you haven't lost
your sense of humor.

233
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,000
You gotta have a sense of humor
in life, right?

234
00:14:04,035 --> 00:14:07,000
- You taught me that.
- And how is life?

235
00:14:07,035 --> 00:14:08,965
Good, good.

236
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,400
Well, I'm separated,
me and Carmela.

237
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,765
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Don't be,

238
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,800
Well, I always thought
I saw some good things there.

239
00:14:18,835 --> 00:14:21,100
Two healthy kids,
other than that...

240
00:14:21,135 --> 00:14:23,865
look, the reason
I called...

241
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,100
I'd like you to have
dinner with me.

242
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,600
Since we're not in therapy no more
and I'm a bachelor again...

243
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,665
That's very
thoughtful of you.

244
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,700
Unfortunately, because of our prior
clinical relationship,

245
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,600
- I just can't do it.
- What, eat?

246
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,400
- You must be a toothpick.
- You know what I mean.

247
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,600
See, I knew you were gonna say
somethin' like that.

248
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:46,600
I can't, Anthony,
I'm sorry.

249
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:53,000
You know, I waited
a respectable period or whatever

250
00:14:53,035 --> 00:14:55,817
- before makin' this call.
- Then you realize yourself

251
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:58,600
there's something not
quite right about us dating.

252
00:14:58,635 --> 00:15:00,900
No, I'm not
undeterred by this.

253
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,400
- We will talk again.
- Thank you for the flowers.

254
00:15:04,435 --> 00:15:07,300
- And the detergent.
- And the detergent.

255
00:15:07,335 --> 00:15:09,917
Of course,
what's wrong with me?

256
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:12,500
I don't know,
but we'll find out.

257
00:15:12,535 --> 00:15:14,900
Leave it to Dr. Tony.

258
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,200
- What's the matter?
- The bear. Stay there!

259
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,300
Oh, right,
lock the door.

260
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,800
What, do you think
he's gonna wipe his feet, too?

261
00:15:57,835 --> 00:15:59,300
He'll smash
through the glass.

262
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,700
Now where is
that guy's card?

263
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,100
I don't know.

264
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,465
You've reached Fish and Game.

265
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,400
- If you know the extension...
- Unbelievable.

266
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,100
If not, press zero
for directory.

267
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,900
Hello?!

268
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,700
For hunting and fishing
licenses, press two.

269
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:32,365
You get a letter from
my cousin in the can?

270
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,600
Yes, Officer Zmuida, hi.
Yes, Mrs. Soprano from North Caldwell?

271
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,100
- We had the bear in our yard.
- What the fuck?

272
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,300
- You're the guys with the pool?
- Yes, it came back.

273
00:16:40,335 --> 00:16:42,000
- Was anybody hurt?
- No, thank God.

274
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,200
- Property damage?
- No property damage either I could see,

275
00:16:45,235 --> 00:16:47,000
but I didn't really
wanna go out there.

276
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,000
Oh, one of those
Eastern black bears?

277
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,700
- We'll be up in about an hour.
- Yes, that'd be great,

278
00:16:51,735 --> 00:16:54,000
- Okay, we'll be here.
- All right, see you then.

279
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,865
Jesus Christ,
when did this happen?

280
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,200
The first time Sunday night,
and I saw it again just now.

281
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,865
AJ didn't even
mention it to you

282
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,800
- when you two went to the game?
- No!

283
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,865
I have to warn
the Cusamanos.

284
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,500
They keep Esterhaz chained up
along the side there.

285
00:17:08,535 --> 00:17:10,500
That bear will
rip him to pieces.

286
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,200
Cusamanos weren't home.
Got the machine.

287
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,400
Well, I don't
see Esterhaz.

288
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,150
Why didn't you call me
when this first happened?

289
00:17:27,185 --> 00:17:29,292
I called the cops.
They called Fish and Game.

290
00:17:29,327 --> 00:17:31,365
Are you tryin'
to prove you're independent?

291
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,465
This isn't "Little House on the
Prairie. " Those things are dangerous.

292
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,700
The ranger, whatever, said it was your
duck food out there that attracted it.

293
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,100
I never heard of that
happening before.

294
00:17:43,135 --> 00:17:45,300
Trapper Joe over here.

295
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,165
Hmm.

296
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,800
We didn't find a spoor.

297
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,000
I was just tellin' the gentleman
the animal still doesn't meet

298
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,100
- the parameters for removal.
- Oh, Jeez.

299
00:18:02,135 --> 00:18:04,365
So, when somebody's
leg is gone...

300
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,800
Problem is it hasn't
really threatened anybody.

301
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,400
Sorry.

302
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,500
Whoa, whoa,
hold on a minute.

303
00:18:19,535 --> 00:18:21,900
You and your pal
buy some new...

304
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,600
lanyards for
your whistles.

305
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,650
Oh, we can't
accept that.

306
00:18:25,685 --> 00:18:27,600
And we don't
have whistles.

307
00:18:27,635 --> 00:18:29,600
Thanks, though.

308
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,100
Ranger Rick's a little light
in the timberlands, huh?

309
00:18:39,135 --> 00:18:41,500
Everybody's always
gay with you.

310
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,200
He's a good-looking guy,
that's all.

311
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,900
I already put
the ammonia on the cans,

312
00:18:52,935 --> 00:18:54,900
I told you.

313
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,200
Look, I came here
to give you your money, but...

314
00:19:17,235 --> 00:19:20,000
this bear thing,
though, I'm... I'm...

315
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,965
I'm worried.

316
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,500
You and AJ here
by yourselves.

317
00:19:24,535 --> 00:19:27,267
What can we do?
You want coffee?

318
00:19:27,302 --> 00:19:30,000
Last time it had
a weird taste.

319
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,265
The coffeemaker
is shot.

320
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,365
The heating element
is corroded, I told you.

321
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,600
That's not the problem.
You don't need another one.

322
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:40,200
Last month, it was
the upstairs toilet. Basta.

323
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,600
He goes down the street
to Willow Drive, too,

324
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,600
maybe he'll
stay down there.

325
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,665
All right, look,

326
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,465
you and AJ, you check
yourself into a hotel

327
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,100
until this thing blows over. Here's
1,200 extra on top of our agreement.

328
00:19:53,135 --> 00:19:55,117
- I'm not going to a hotel.
- Why not?

329
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,065
I don't wanna break
Anthony's routines.

330
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,500
He'll get a kick out of it.
It's an adventure.

331
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,665
God knows he loves
room service.

332
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,400
Yeah, I'll give him room service...
the end of my foot.

333
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,900
What's with the attitude?

334
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,800
Well, he's an asshole,
that's what.

335
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,700
- So what? It's his age.
- Yeah, thank you, I know.

336
00:20:12,735 --> 00:20:14,365
But you buy him
too much stuff,

337
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,000
I think because you feel
guilty about the separation.

338
00:20:17,035 --> 00:20:19,865
Excuse me.
It wasn't my idea.

339
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,900
There is more than one way
to ask for something.

340
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,050
- Could we please not?
- Spend $5,000 on a set of drums...

341
00:20:26,085 --> 00:20:30,100
SAT tutor, coffeemaker,
I gotta fight you tooth and nail.

342
00:20:30,135 --> 00:20:32,017
All I said was
I wanna see statements

343
00:20:32,052 --> 00:20:33,900
from the tutor
or he doesn't get paid!

344
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,500
He's a college kid, Tony,
he's not set up for that.

345
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,800
You worried he's gonna
soak you for an extra pencil?

346
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,100
Oh, rimshot!

347
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,100
What I think, Tony, is you're
trying to make my life now

348
00:20:44,135 --> 00:20:46,100
as hard on me
financially as possible.

349
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,900
- Oh, it should be easy.
- Unbelievable.

350
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,300
What do you think,
you're the only Catholic here?

351
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,400
I'm old school. I don't believe in this
separation shit and divorce,

352
00:20:55,435 --> 00:20:58,600
even if my wife was going
after some fucking immigrant!

353
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,300
Yet you are modern enough to use
a cell phone to call Italy

354
00:21:03,335 --> 00:21:06,400
and every other fucking place
to threaten the guy's life.

355
00:21:06,435 --> 00:21:08,865
Oh, that's right.
Certain people see him,

356
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,900
- he's a dead man.
- He had coffee here, Tony, that's all.

357
00:21:12,935 --> 00:21:14,817
And now
the coffeemaker sucks.

358
00:21:14,852 --> 00:21:16,700
How do you like
them apples?

359
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,500
You don't wanna stay at a hotel,
you suit yourself.

360
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,000
This is Anthony.

361
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,650
Could you call me
at 973-555-1299?

362
00:21:33,685 --> 00:21:37,200
I'm thinking maybe
I gotta come back,

363
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:41,000
you know,
for therapy.

364
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,700
- Smells good, Feech.
- Yeah?

365
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,265
- You want a taste?
- Nah, I'll wait.

366
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,100
No offense, kid, but don't look to me
like you do a lot of waiting.

367
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,465
Just like
his old man, huh?

368
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,700
Lotta changes since
you went away, huh?

369
00:21:56,735 --> 00:21:58,765
20 years, Madonn'.

370
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,400
Know what the biggest change for me is?
Broads shaving their bushes.

371
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,500
I went over to Silvio's, it's like
the Girl Scouts over there.

372
00:22:05,535 --> 00:22:08,565
I think I'll let
this simmer a bit.

373
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,100
Must be different in the can now,
not like the old days.

374
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,065
Fuckin' animals.

375
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,200
It's all about
setting a precedent.

376
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,100
First day there,
I walk in a mess,

377
00:22:20,135 --> 00:22:22,900
I'm wearin' a puss,
a fuckin' scowl.

378
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,200
I look around...

379
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,200
My nephew.

380
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,500
Right in the middle
of my story!

381
00:22:30,535 --> 00:22:32,700
There he is,
the man, the legend,

382
00:22:32,735 --> 00:22:34,465
Feech La Manna.

383
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,800
Hey, my God
look at you!

384
00:22:36,835 --> 00:22:38,865
You big galoot!

385
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,500
What'd you go straight
from the joint to Earl Scheib?

386
00:22:41,535 --> 00:22:45,165
Look at this fucking tan.

387
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,365
You close the cellar door
when you came up?

388
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,400
It's like the Bowery Boys in here
with this house arrest here.

389
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,700
Code words
and secret passages.

390
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,400
- He's in the middle of a story.
- When isn't he?

391
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,500
Hey.

392
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,900
It's day one,
I'm in the mess,

393
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,765
I look around
and I spot

394
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,465
the biggest, blackest motherfucker
that I can find.

395
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,600
Everybody's looking at me
and I walk right up to him and I say,

396
00:23:11,635 --> 00:23:15,300
"What the fuck are you looking at?"
He says, "What?"

397
00:23:15,335 --> 00:23:17,267
I said, "You heard me,
motherfucker.

398
00:23:17,302 --> 00:23:19,165
What the fuck
are you looking at?!"

399
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,500
With that, I hit him! Bam!
Right across the fucking coconut!

400
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:24,300
He goes down,
I'm on top of him.

401
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,700
Everybody around!
He gets some shots in.

402
00:23:26,735 --> 00:23:28,800
Everybody's going
fucking crazy!

403
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,900
The screws,
this guy, everybody!

404
00:23:30,935 --> 00:23:33,000
"Motherfucker!"

405
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,200
From that time on,

406
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,150
nobody so much as
looks at me cross-eyed!

407
00:23:38,185 --> 00:23:40,000
- Well, welcome home, huh?
- Cent'anni.

408
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:44,000
- Welcome home.
- Welcome home.

409
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,000
The reason I wanted to see you,
Junior, Tony too,

410
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,000
now that I'm out,
I'd like to get back in the game.

411
00:23:53,035 --> 00:23:55,065
What'd you
have in mind?

412
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,900
You know me,
I'm an entrepreneur.

413
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,900
Get my shy going,
sports book, whatever you say.

414
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,400
As long as you don't
step on anybody's toes.

415
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,600
Me?
I'm Fred Astaire.

416
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,400
What's this
Feech tells me,

417
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,500
you got a bear
up there at the house?

418
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,265
What, it's on fucking CNN?

419
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,250
No, it's just that your wife's up there,
and the kids...

420
00:24:25,285 --> 00:24:28,200
your ex-wife, whatever.
It's just that wild animals,

421
00:24:28,235 --> 00:24:30,400
they're dangerous.
People talk.

422
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,200
What people? Who?

423
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,300
I don't know.

424
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:42,300
What am I supposed to do, go up there
personally and set fucking bear traps?

425
00:24:42,335 --> 00:24:45,400
We're separated,
for Christ's sake.

426
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,200
So, where's the dinner at?

427
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,000
Oh, I forget the name.
It's in the car.

428
00:24:58,035 --> 00:25:00,000
Who's gonna be there?

429
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,100
What are you,
on the school paper? Guys.

430
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:05,400
It's business.

431
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,100
- You got any cash?
- Some.

432
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,200
Hand me my bag.

433
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,165
- That's all you got?
- It's like $400.

434
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,850
I'm low man tonight,
I gotta pay for everybody.

435
00:25:23,885 --> 00:25:26,500
You know, this is fucking
ridiculous, Christopher.

436
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,700
Why should you get stuck all the time?
You should make Paulie pay.

437
00:25:29,735 --> 00:25:32,300
What, I make the rules now?
Guy's a captain.

438
00:25:32,335 --> 00:25:35,565
I know, but when
he was in jail...

439
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,400
All's I'm saying is if you get
the extra responsibilities,

440
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,200
you should get
the benefits, too.

441
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,100
You're right.

442
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,900
I'll say hello
to the guys from you.

443
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,600
Benny, hi!
Come on in.

444
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,000
Tony sent me. He says he wants somebody
stationed in the yard.

445
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,250
- He's worried the bear might come back.
- What?

446
00:26:14,285 --> 00:26:16,365
- No, I don't want this.
- We'll switch off,

447
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,700
- me and Paulie Germani.
- This is silly, I'm gonna call him.

448
00:26:19,735 --> 00:26:21,800
Actually, it's not
that silly, Mrs. S.

449
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,200
If it was my family, I'd wanna know
there was a male at the house, too.

450
00:26:25,235 --> 00:26:27,300
What can you do about it
if it does come back?

451
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,165
Tony said you should
unlock the closet,

452
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,400
- give me the "shkupit" he called it.
- Oh, for God's sake.

453
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,100
We'll call
the Fish and Game, too.

454
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,500
It's just... I'll have
the weapon in case.

455
00:26:36,535 --> 00:26:38,800
He's just worried
about you, that's all.

456
00:26:38,835 --> 00:26:41,300
And Anthony.

457
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,000
Okay, I don't know.

458
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,200
You're very nice
to do this.

459
00:26:48,235 --> 00:26:50,200
Nice got nothing
to do with it.

460
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,700
Stay inside. You don't have to sit
out there like a fistful of dollars.

461
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,700
Tony said not in the house.
I got my little Sony in the car.

462
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,100
You want something to eat?
We were just about to sit down.

463
00:27:03,135 --> 00:27:06,100
Nah, I'm good.
I just stopped at Tio Pepe's.

464
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,900
This freaking olive oil.
The food's drenched.

465
00:27:11,935 --> 00:27:13,565
That's the reason
it happened.

466
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,600
As far as fucking bears
are concerned?

467
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:17,465
I say get rid
of them all.

468
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,900
They had their turn,
and now we got ours.

469
00:27:19,935 --> 00:27:22,265
That's why dinosaurs
don't exist no more.

470
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,500
- Wasn't it a meteor?
- They're all meat eaters.

471
00:27:24,535 --> 00:27:27,467
- Meteor, meteor.
- Take it easy.

472
00:27:27,502 --> 00:27:30,400
Gentlemen,
whenever you're ready.

473
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,000
- All right, are we set?
- Yeah, sure.

474
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,500
What are you doing,
you ready?

475
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,665
I gotta make
a pit stop.

476
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,200
Eh, you forgetting
something?

477
00:27:47,235 --> 00:27:49,700
You get it.
I got the last one.

478
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
Here, baby, have some
more cheesecake.

479
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,600
The other thing with bears is: if you're
ever chased by one, run downhill.

480
00:27:56,635 --> 00:27:59,900
- For some reason, they can't do that.
- It's the moss.

481
00:27:59,935 --> 00:28:02,300
They attack when you're
having your period, too.

482
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,600
No, no,
that's jungle cats.

483
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,865
- So can we go?
- Hold your horses.

484
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,800
- What's goin' on, we ready or what?
- Yeah.

485
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,500
- Fine, I'll get it.
- Gimme the fucking thing.

486
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,700
- I said I'll get it.
- Enough. It's done.

487
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,800
- $860.00.
- What?

488
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,300
You heard me.
That's what you owe from last night.

489
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,565
You said, you got it.

490
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,165
I only got like
$100 on me, anyways.

491
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,900
Then get the rest by tonight
or you start paying points.

492
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,400
I'm thinking of going
for the acupuncture.

493
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,565
- What, your shoulder again?
- Those long drives.

494
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,850
- It's already tender.
- Next time, we get you out there.

495
00:29:09,885 --> 00:29:13,100
After 18 years in the can,
I'm just happy to be outside.

496
00:29:13,135 --> 00:29:15,800
What, they don't have
a golf course at Leavenworth?

497
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,300
Still a smart ass,
this one.

498
00:29:19,335 --> 00:29:21,165
Carmine,
you all right?

499
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,750
You barely touched
your egg salad.

500
00:29:23,785 --> 00:29:26,300
Too much gherkins.
You smell that?

501
00:29:26,335 --> 00:29:28,200
- What?
- Burning hair.

502
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,200
I smell cut grass.

503
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,000
- Any word on your cousin getting out?
- Who's your cousin again?

504
00:29:36,035 --> 00:29:38,500
- Tony Blundetto.
- Oh, yeah, good guy.

505
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,800
Right, right.
He was my best buddy inside.

506
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,500
- So you gonna give him a party?
- When he get home, get him laid.

507
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:47,900
What's the matter,
Carmine?

508
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,500
- Carmine?
- Jesus Christ!

509
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,100
- Call an ambulance.
- Yes, sir.

510
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,765
Is he breathing?

511
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,000
- Get that egg salad out of his mouth.
- Hurry up!

512
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,400
- Lupertazzi residence.
- Carmine, it's John.

513
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,100
Hey, John boy,
how's the weather?

514
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,350
Look, I got some bad news.
Your dad's had a stroke.

515
00:30:14,385 --> 00:30:17,500
- Oh my God, how bad?
- There's some paralysis.

516
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,000
It's too early to tell yet.
They're doing everything they can.

517
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,000
- Is my mom there?
- I just called her, she's on her way.

518
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,500
We're over
at St. Vincent's.

519
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,600
Anything, John,
anything he needs.

520
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,300
I'm on the next plane.

521
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,600
Sad, this shit, huh?

522
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,200
I wonder if I can
smoke in here.

523
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:42,200
You know, I haven't forgotten
our arrangement last year,

524
00:30:42,235 --> 00:30:44,565
you leaving me
in the lurch like that.

525
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,800
It was the right thing to do, John.
Taking out a boss? Come on.

526
00:30:47,835 --> 00:30:50,000
- Even still.
- What do you want, an apology?

527
00:30:50,035 --> 00:30:52,000
Fucking Whitman Sampler,
what?

528
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,600
Boy, imagine if his
fucking speech is affected.

529
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,800
Poor bastard.

530
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,600
When you're up at the house,
who comes to visit? Anybody?

531
00:31:16,635 --> 00:31:20,000
Mostly Rosalie Aprile,
Sil's wife.

532
00:31:20,035 --> 00:31:21,665
Who calls on the phone?

533
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,800
Most of the calls seem
to be for Anthony.

534
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,000
So...?

535
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,600
Look, the real
reason I'm here

536
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,765
is to confront you

537
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,300
in a positive way about
taking our relationship

538
00:32:23,335 --> 00:32:25,965
in that other direction.

539
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,650
Why did you have
to be underhanded?

540
00:32:28,685 --> 00:32:31,265
I don't find that
appealing, frankly.

541
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,500
I was gonna ask you out
for coffee or something,

542
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,100
but I didn't think you'd go.

543
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,500
I'll pay for the hour,
that goes without saying.

544
00:32:37,535 --> 00:32:39,100
Forget that.

545
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,200
I was listening
to that guy on TV, Dr. Phil?

546
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,800
And he was talking about
a similar situation

547
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,665
and he said that you could,
if you wanted to.

548
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,000
There's no set rules.
It's basically about malpractice,

549
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,100
- and you probably couldn't get sued.
- That's not the point.

550
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,100
Look, I was thinking about
all kinds of moves...

551
00:33:07,135 --> 00:33:09,065
"Buy her a piece
of jewelry.

552
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,065
Pay the guy to close down
the restaurant

553
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,500
where she eats lunch
and hire a mandolin player. "

554
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:15,400
This is the place
where we've been

555
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,565
most honest
with each other.

556
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,400
And that's the way
I always liked it.

557
00:33:20,435 --> 00:33:22,365
So that being said,

558
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,300
if you don't like me
personally,

559
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,100
or the cut of my jib,
or my face, or whatever,

560
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,600
then the matter will end here
and I will never ask you again.

561
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,600
You can be honest.

562
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,800
I like you, Anthony.

563
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,450
And, no, you have
a very nice face.

564
00:33:43,485 --> 00:33:46,000
- Working on the weight, too.
- Good.

565
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,000
Explain to me, okay,

566
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,800
why this is a matter
of such importance to you.

567
00:33:54,835 --> 00:33:56,867
There must be plenty
of women out there.

568
00:33:56,902 --> 00:33:58,900
You're different
from what's out there,

569
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,100
not to mention being
drop-dead beautiful.

570
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,465
My training teaches me
to go fairly quickly

571
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,400
to the idea that what you really
want is to come back to therapy.

572
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,700
Jesus Christ Almighty,
come on, will you?!

573
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,800
Your marriage of 20-something
years has collapsed,

574
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:17,065
no doubt there are issues
with your children.

575
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,900
Why can't I do something that's just
for me for a change?

576
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,100
It would be for you.

577
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,865
All right,
well, I want you.

578
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,600
And not just for the smart things
you say. I-I-I want...

579
00:34:28,635 --> 00:34:32,900
I want your skin.
I want your mouth.

580
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,900
I want your eyes.

581
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,800
You project all these
qualities onto me.

582
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,300
You don't know me.

583
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,200
This is what happens
between doctor and patient.

584
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,800
Don't do that.

585
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,200
Outta respect
for this office.

586
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,465
You know,
forget about the way

587
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,900
that Tony Soprano
makes his way in the world,

588
00:35:24,935 --> 00:35:27,200
that's just
to feed his children.

589
00:35:27,235 --> 00:35:29,265
There's two Tony Sopranos.

590
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,400
You've never seen
the other one.

591
00:35:31,435 --> 00:35:33,500
That's the one
I wanna show to you.

592
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,465
- Hi.
- Hi.

593
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,900
- I... I wonder if I could use the WC?
- Of course, come on in.

594
00:36:20,935 --> 00:36:23,600
- Yeah, okay.
- Is it cold out?

595
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,000
Yeah, a little,
but I got a fleece.

596
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:52,000
I know him, he'll just keep coming
back and coming back.

597
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,000
How to let him
down easy, I...

598
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,200
- Think it's worth telling the police?
- What?

599
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,600
Jesus, Elliot.

600
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,000
I don't want to paint
in somber tones here,

601
00:37:02,035 --> 00:37:03,565
but the man is a sociopath,

602
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,700
unpracticed in not
getting what he wants.

603
00:37:06,735 --> 00:37:09,100
And now, since
the therapy is kaput,

604
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,500
what use are you to him
except for sex?

605
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,400
Thank you, Elliot.

606
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,700
Your depth of feeling is
really quite extraordinary here.

607
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,200
All you could come up with
was this weak borscht

608
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,800
about professional ethics,
because you are worried

609
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,300
about how this thug
will handle rejection.

610
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,100
You know, at first

611
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,000
I did find him a little sexy...

612
00:37:33,035 --> 00:37:35,367
dangerous, alpha male...

613
00:37:35,402 --> 00:37:38,201
but as year followed year,

614
00:37:38,236 --> 00:37:41,000
the ugliness I saw, I heard...

615
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,665
You kept him
a long time, though.

616
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:48,600
There's a mutual sympathy
there of some kind, I guess.

617
00:37:48,635 --> 00:37:50,900
Maybe it's just
the Italian thing.

618
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,200
- Sil said you were looking for me?
- Sit down.

619
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,250
This about
the Easter baskets?

620
00:38:12,285 --> 00:38:14,400
I don't even
know what that is,

621
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,750
and, to tell you the truth,
I don't wanna know.

622
00:38:16,785 --> 00:38:19,000
Now what's this shit
between you and Paulie?

623
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,100
- You chiseled him out of a dinner?
- I chiseled him?

624
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:25,300
- He said that?
- I asked you a question.

625
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,865
Can I say something
in my own defense?

626
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,600
It's not right that
I have to pay all the time.

627
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,800
I've been paying
for fucking years.

628
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,200
You done? Good.

629
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,600
You pay till I tell you
you don't have to pay no more.

630
00:38:39,635 --> 00:38:42,265
And don't give me
that face.

631
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,500
You know how many tabs, how many
dinners I picked up over the years?

632
00:38:45,535 --> 00:38:47,800
I got Richie Aprile,
fat fucking Jerry Anastasia.

633
00:38:47,835 --> 00:38:50,365
Those guys killed me
at Benihana's.

634
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,900
And forget it, if they want a steak.
I put a new wing on Peter Luger's.

635
00:38:53,935 --> 00:38:56,665
Brandy, cigars, champagne.

636
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,500
Could've bought
a fucking plane.

637
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,800
I hear you, Ton',
but that was before inflation...

638
00:39:00,835 --> 00:39:03,000
Whatever.

639
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,400
It's tradition.

640
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,600
It's like in ancient times,
the samurais,

641
00:39:07,635 --> 00:39:09,400
they had these pages...

642
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,550
young boys that
did their errands,

643
00:39:11,585 --> 00:39:13,600
washed their clothes,
shit like that.

644
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,200
It's a sign of respect.

645
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,865
Why don't you cheer up?

646
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,800
One day, some kid'll be
paying for your dinners.

647
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:28,600
Atlantic City loves
its oldies on Oldies 98.3.

648
00:39:28,635 --> 00:39:31,300
# Now that you're gone... #

649
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,700
So the Pope says,
"Just-a one-a more thing:

650
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,900
She gotta have-a
big-a tits. "

651
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,800
Oh, man!

652
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,200
That was good!

653
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,600
You okay, Ton'?
You're being like a little quiet.

654
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,000
Yeah, yeah.
I'm just... I'm full, that's all.

655
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,600
Calm before the storm. Get him near
those crap tables and look out.

656
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,500
Jesus, I'm stuffed. I can't remember
the last time I ate this much.

657
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,300
Sure youse don't
want no dessert?

658
00:39:57,335 --> 00:40:00,500
- Not for me.
- I'm good.

659
00:40:00,535 --> 00:40:02,600
Thank you.

660
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,600
- Thanks.
- Enjoy it, girls.

661
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,800
I been enjoying looking
at youse the whole night.

662
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,800
- Get some fucking glasses.
- We gotta go.

663
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,100
All right, I'll see you over
at the $100 table.

664
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,900
- Yeah.
- Right.

665
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,200
Ton', you sure you're all right?
You got a big moose on.

666
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,200
It's a fucking broad,
believe that?

667
00:40:34,235 --> 00:40:36,500
Really?
You mean...?

668
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,700
- It's the real deal, I think.
- No shit, huh?

669
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,400
See? The thing is,

670
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,100
we got this
platonic thing going.

671
00:40:45,135 --> 00:40:46,865
We have had
for many years.

672
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:50,165
She thinks that's what it is,
but it's not,

673
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,100
and no amount of convincing
will change her mind.

674
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:59,400
- So she was a... friend.
- Yeah.

675
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,300
They're wrapping up a lobster roll
for me to take to Ginny.

676
00:41:04,335 --> 00:41:06,000
- We'll see you's over there.
- Yeah.

677
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,000
- Anything else, gentlemen?
- We're good.

678
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,800
My friend here'll
take the check, though.

679
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,900
Have a wonderful evening.

680
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,700
# Let's get it on #

681
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,965
1184.

682
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,865
Oh... babe.

683
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,600
I gotta play that number.

684
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,600
Hmm, I'm gonna go wash up.

685
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,600
# We're all
sensitive people #

686
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,300
# With so much
love to give. #

687
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,750
I'll tell you,
after a meal like that,

688
00:41:42,785 --> 00:41:45,100
what I could use is
a nice piece of ass.

689
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,700
Who knows,
maybe I'll call down,

690
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,300
have them send
one up to the room.

691
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,100
Why don't you just fuck yourself?
Save a little money.

692
00:41:51,135 --> 00:41:53,465
- What's your problem?!
- Stop trying to bait me.

693
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,600
- You know what my fucking problem is!
- No, why don't you tell me?

694
00:41:56,635 --> 00:42:00,017
You want me to tell you? Fine!
Steaks, 3 Ib. -lobsters,

695
00:42:00,052 --> 00:42:03,400
the shrimp fucking cocktails
you made everybody get.

696
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,800
Then on top of everything else, you send
those skanks a bottle of Cristal?

697
00:42:06,835 --> 00:42:09,565
I was being a gentleman.
You oughtta try it some time.

698
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,400
Not to mention the Lyonnaise fucking
potatoes you didn't even touch.

699
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,100
- What?! I lost my appetite.
- Fuck you!

700
00:42:16,135 --> 00:42:18,700
- Excuse me?
- You fucking heard me!

701
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,100
I'm telling you, I don't give a fuck
anymore who you're related to.

702
00:42:22,135 --> 00:42:23,700
Go ahead, Paulie.
Go for it.

703
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,365
Your big fucking moment.

704
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,000
- You little fuck...
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

705
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,865
Was there a problem
with the service?

706
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:34,200
- What are you talking about?
- You left me $16, sir.

707
00:42:34,235 --> 00:42:37,500
- Perhaps you miscounted.
- There's 1200 bucks in there.

708
00:42:37,535 --> 00:42:41,400
That's correct,
and the bill was $1184.

709
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,900
Assuming you don't tip
on tax or alcohol, 15%...

710
00:42:43,935 --> 00:42:46,465
I'm tapped out.

711
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,150
You think this job is easy?
I have kids.

712
00:42:49,185 --> 00:42:51,765
Then go back inside
before you get hurt.

713
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,900
- I have a goddamn family to support.
- Fuck off.

714
00:42:54,935 --> 00:42:58,400
Yeah, right.
Go piss it away at blackjack,

715
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,500
- fucking assholes!
- Oh!

716
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:07,600
What do you
gotta say now?

717
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,465
Chrissie, he's fucked up.

718
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:18,700
Don't they have medicine they're
supposed to take, these assholes?

719
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,600
I don't know.

720
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,000
He'll say we hit him
with a brick.

721
00:43:23,035 --> 00:43:25,300
He's still going,
this asshole.

722
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,600
That's my money,
Paulie!

723
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,800
How's he doing?

724
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,600
I love him so much
and I can't do shit.

725
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,100
We're all praying
for him.

726
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,700
You know, you were
another son to him.

727
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,600
- Yeah?
- You get some sleep?

728
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:40,700
Yeah, a little,
you know.

729
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,600
- Fucked up, huh?
- What are you gonna do?

730
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,900
I'm not too worried
about the cops.

731
00:44:45,935 --> 00:44:47,300
Nobody knows us down there.

732
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,400
The reason I called.

733
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,600
Let's bury the hatchet,
you and me.

734
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,300
All this bullshit
with us.

735
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,850
I know, I know,
it's stupid.

736
00:44:55,885 --> 00:44:57,300
Life's too short,
Chrissie.

737
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,100
You can't waste it
fighting with your friends.

738
00:45:00,135 --> 00:45:02,200
Look what could've
happened last night.

739
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,300
One of us could've got hurt
or even killed for Christ's sake.

740
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:08,100
- I know.
- You're special to me, you know.

741
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:12,100
- Always have been.
- You, too, Paulie... to me.

742
00:45:12,135 --> 00:45:14,900
We'll split the tab.

743
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,300
I'm sorry, Paulie.

744
00:45:17,335 --> 00:45:19,600
I apologize too, kid.

745
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,400
I'll talk to you later.

746
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,400
When you say that,
you make me feel...

747
00:45:34,435 --> 00:45:36,700
less than.

748
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,300
Next week, everyone.

749
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,100
Good luck.

750
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,500
- I'm going outta town next week.
- Okay.

751
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,600
Good night.

752
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,200
Anthony.

753
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,500
- Hello.
- Hey.

754
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,000
A friend of mine
had these.

755
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,800
I'll see you
next week.

756
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,800
Like I was saying, a friend of mine
had these and couldn't use them.

757
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,800
I figured, well...

758
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,900
maybe we could.

759
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,800
Tickets, Bermuda, lodging
at the Elbow Beach Hotel.

760
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I turned down a wonderful
dinner invitation,

761
00:46:44,035 --> 00:46:46,300
and you think
I'll go away with you?

762
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,100
Well, the guy couldn't
use them and...

763
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,000
you know, he gave them to me. What do
you want me to do, throw them away?

764
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,700
Come on, I'm breaking
out the big guns here.

765
00:46:58,735 --> 00:47:01,200
You're turning me
into half a stalker.

766
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,965
Listen, Anthony, I'm...

767
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,700
I'm not going to
go out with you, okay?

768
00:47:09,735 --> 00:47:12,400
And it's not because
you're unattractive

769
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,650
or I don't think I
would have a good time,

770
00:47:14,685 --> 00:47:17,492
it's just something
I'm not going to do.

771
00:47:17,527 --> 00:47:20,265
And I would like you
to respect my decision,

772
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:24,000
and just try to feel that
I know what's right for me.

773
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,600
Okay?

774
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,865
But it's not
just the...

775
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:42,300
psychiatric ethics
stuff, is it?

776
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,365
I wanna preserve
the option for you

777
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,600
that you could always
come back to our work,

778
00:47:47,635 --> 00:47:49,265
if you wish.

779
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:52,000
And that we could pick up
where we've left off.

780
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,200
I don't think you
get this, I want you!

781
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,400
And that's very
flattering to me.

782
00:47:56,435 --> 00:47:58,465
I'm not interested
in flattering you.

783
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,700
- I know you're not.
- All right, then what is it?

784
00:48:00,735 --> 00:48:03,467
Okay, what is it?
Just...

785
00:48:03,502 --> 00:48:06,200
help me
understand it, okay?

786
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:14,000
You know, Anthony,
during therapy I...

787
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:17,200
I never judged you
or your behavior.

788
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,900
It's not the place
of a therapist to do so.

789
00:48:19,935 --> 00:48:21,900
All right,
I get all this. Go, go.

790
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,300
In a personal relationship,

791
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,600
I don't think
I could sit silent.

792
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,700
About what?

793
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,665
Our values are...

794
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:39,400
- just very different.
- You don't like my values?

795
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,500
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

796
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,800
No.

797
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,765
Okay. Like what?

798
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,000
- It's getting late, I...
- No, no, no. Come on.

799
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,100
It's okay, it's okay.

800
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,300
Well...

801
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,600
you're not
a truthful person.

802
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,865
You're not
respectful of women.

803
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,865
You're not really
respectful of people.

804
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:14,000
- I don't love people?
- Maybe you love them, I don't know.

805
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:16,665
You take what you want
from them by force

806
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:20,400
or the threat of force.
I couldn't live like that.

807
00:49:20,435 --> 00:49:24,100
- I couldn't bear witness to violence...
- Fuck you!

808
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,100
You're a fucking cunt!

809
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:50,300
Oh.

810
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,200
How come Benny's
not outside?

811
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,400
He just got here,
he's going out.

812
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Where is he?

813
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:07,100
He's in your office on the phone
with his girlfriend.

814
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,700
Hey, Ton',
how's it going?

815
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,065
You can take the night off.
I'll spell you.

816
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,700
No, no, no, Ton',
that's all right, it's okay, really.

817
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,700
I'll take over,
okay, for tonight.

818
00:50:21,735 --> 00:50:24,067
Okay, well...
night, Mrs. S.

819
00:50:24,102 --> 00:50:26,400
Good night, Benny,
thank you.

820
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,500
- You want coffee?
- No.

821
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,765
# I'm gonna turn
and walk away #

822
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,900
# There's nothing left
for me to say #

823
00:52:01,935 --> 00:52:05,000
# It wouldn't
change things anyway #

824
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:08,765
# Oh, I suppose #

825
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,200
# The love I gave
was always true #

826
00:52:12,235 --> 00:52:15,417
# Well, I don't know
what else to do #

827
00:52:15,452 --> 00:52:18,600
# And how I'll
ever get over you #

828
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:22,300
# Heaven only knows #

829
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,750
# Heaven only
knows just why #

830
00:52:25,785 --> 00:52:28,892
# Loving you
should make me cry #

831
00:52:28,927 --> 00:52:32,000
# Make me feel
like I could die #

832
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:35,800
# That's the way it goes #

833
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:38,665
# Heaven only ever sees #

834
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:42,465
# How love's
made a fool of me #

835
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,900
# I guess that's how
it's meant to be #

836
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,300
# But heaven only knows #

837
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,600
# Heaven only knows
just why #

838
00:52:57,635 --> 00:53:00,800
# Loving you
should make me cry #

839
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:04,350
# Make me feel
like I could die #

840
00:53:04,385 --> 00:53:07,800
# But that's
the way it goes #

841
00:53:07,835 --> 00:53:10,665
# Heaven only ever sees #

842
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:14,465
# How love's
made a fool of me #

843
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:17,400
# I guess that's how
it's meant to be #

844
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:21,300
# But heaven only knows. #

845
00:53:22,305 --> 00:54:22,935

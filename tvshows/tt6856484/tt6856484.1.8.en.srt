1
00:00:03,271 --> 00:00:04,438
Can you get me some help?

2
00:00:04,472 --> 00:00:05,539
I need some help here.

3
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:07,575
Ryan? Ryan!

4
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,779
You asshole, when did you get
back into town?

5
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:12,780
Well, hello, sis.

6
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:15,549
You don't give a shit
about anyone but you.

7
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:18,419
If a soul wants to move on
but finds itself trapped,

8
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:20,254
that soul will lash out
at the living.

9
00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:24,492
As long as the power's out,
nowhere is safe.

10
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,227
My mother, Maggie, where is she?

11
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,795
She's dead.

12
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:29,230
Hey, Roman, right on time.

13
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:30,564
What did you do to her, Father?!

14
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:38,739
What's happening?

15
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,308
Wow, you know what?

16
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:41,575
You know what, baby?

17
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:45,813
The town-the town's drawing too
much power for this generator.

18
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,781
This is major demand.

19
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:48,882
The grid.

20
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:50,460
I'm gonna shut down a couple
of the smaller grids!

21
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:52,253
Paolo? Paolo?

22
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,791
Billy! Billy!

23
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:01,895
Come on, Billy.

24
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:02,730
Goddammit, come on!

25
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:03,897
Dear God!

26
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:06,400
The town's drawing too much
power from the generator.

27
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:09,370
Billy said to turn off some
of the smaller grids.

28
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:17,878
Come on. Godammit, Billy.

29
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,214
Do you know which system
goes to the church?

30
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:21,882
He didn't say.

31
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,185
That was a hell of a blast,
Danny.

32
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:25,553
I gotta tell ya.

33
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:28,722
I felt like I was knocked
right out of my-

34
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,358
Billy.

35
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:32,560
Out of my boots.

36
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:38,632
Billy!

37
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:42,803
No, no.

38
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,473
Wait, wait, wait.

39
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:48,442
I can't-this...

40
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,648
this can't be happening.

41
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,737
This... this isn't happening.

42
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,733
Billy come on!

43
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:47,835
Landis, you did it!

44
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:49,270
You did it!

45
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:51,939
That's it. He's breathing.

46
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:54,342
I got a heart beat.

47
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,844
We're gonna have to get him
into town.

48
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:57,778
Lambda's closer.

49
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,813
We've got medical facilities.

50
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:04,952
Hey!

51
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:05,653
Hey, hey, hey!

52
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,487
Roman!

53
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,321
Roman!

54
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:08,055
Roman!

55
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:08,889
- What the hell?
- No, no, no!

56
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,424
This way! This way!

57
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,269
We have to stick together
to help each other out!

58
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:14,428
You gotta be fu kidding me!

59
00:03:14,462 --> 00:03:15,396
You need my help?

60
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:16,673
The way that-the way
that you helped me?

61
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:17,465
What?

62
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:19,267
The way that you helped
my mother?

63
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,369
I know that you ran her
out of town.

64
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:22,670
I know.

65
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:23,604
And she died.

66
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:24,972
So what happened?

67
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:27,275
Now you just hang on.

68
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:28,342
Ok, yeah.

69
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:29,176
We made her leave.

70
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,447
What happens next, Doug,
is she died.

71
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:36,484
And that's on you.

72
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:38,852
That's on all of you.

73
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:41,731
I'll do what I can but
I'm warning you right now

74
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:42,990
I'm not a medical doctor.

75
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,925
You've got medical equipment,
drugs?

76
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:45,859
Yeah, in case of an emergency

77
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,462
but we're not designed
to be a hospital.

78
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:50,030
There must be something
you can do.

79
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,901
I can take a stool sample,
draw some blood.

80
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:54,968
Go back upstairs.

81
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:57,738
Get Paolo to find Dr. Dufresne.

82
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:04,478
We both know that Port Moore
is a better place

83
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:06,013
without Nadine Mercer.

84
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,948
If she's dead and we drove
her away-

85
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,383
It's not our fault.

86
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:10,618
Roman doesn't believe that.

87
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,052
And we need him on our side.

88
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,389
He either does the right thing
or he doesn't.

89
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:17,891
That blood is on his hands.

90
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,428
I just don't want it to be
my blood.

91
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:23,731
At least you're not them.

92
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,833
And you've got one more day.

93
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:27,601
Val.

94
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,303
Mar?

95
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:30,904
God.

96
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:32,906
Are the girls ok?

97
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,475
Yeah, they're inside.
They're safe.

98
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:35,142
What happened?

99
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:36,219
I spent the night holed up-

100
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:38,679
Father Dan just radioed.
There's been an accident.

101
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,348
It's Billy.

102
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:47,421
He's moving.

103
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:48,756
Yes, he's twitching.

104
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,559
It's normal in electrocution
victims.

105
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:54,962
I can't lose him.

106
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,964
He's gonna be alright.

107
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:00,768
You done this before?

108
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,036
Me and Billy, Doug and Rodney.

109
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,938
Yes.

110
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:08,609
These ghosts have a way of
dredging up our secrets.

111
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:12,513
They forced us to deal
with our past.

112
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:15,048
They helped us heal old wounds.

113
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:17,918
Yes.

114
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,855
I'm hoping that everyone heals.

115
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,891
His heart rate's erratic.

116
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:31,098
I should... I should go back
to the church.

117
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,975
Ok, he's going into VFIB.
Forget the medication.

118
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,444
I need that crash cart.

119
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,054
That's the last one.

120
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:57,658
God, our help in ages past,

121
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:01,862
Our hope for years to come,

122
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:05,666
Our shelter from
the stormy blast,

123
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,167
And our eternal-

124
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,969
Carol!

125
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:10,638
Please.

126
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:11,872
Norm.

127
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:13,607
Leave her alone.

128
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:18,846
Beneath the shadow
of thy throne,

129
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,650
So what do we do now?

130
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:24,585
What do you think we do?

131
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:26,654
We bury them.

132
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:30,558
And our defenses sure.

133
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:32,025
Clear.

134
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,872
He's got a heart beat.

135
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:50,110
It's slow and weak
but it's steady.

136
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,945
Thank you.

137
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,157
Father.

138
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,593
Thank god you're alright.

139
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:06,770
I- I heard there was
an injury and I-

140
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:08,662
It was Billy McGrath.

141
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:09,463
The wicked are doomed.

142
00:07:09,497 --> 00:07:12,099
They get exactly
what they deserve.

143
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,002
Here.

144
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,005
We all have sinned

145
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:21,008
and failed short of
the glory of God, Carol.

146
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:23,544
Yes.

147
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:26,213
You've been through a lot.

148
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:28,115
It was awful.

149
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:31,619
Like hell on earth.

150
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:34,187
You're ok. You're strong.

151
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:36,023
Thank god we have
our faith, Father.

152
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:39,092
May the Lord be our saviour.

153
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:43,664
I see that Doug's leading
the funeral committee.

154
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,232
Now that you're here I'm sure-

155
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:47,034
No, no, that's ok.

156
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,503
He's gonna do a fine job.

157
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:52,640
I'm gonna get some rest.

158
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:53,173
You should go home.

159
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:54,174
No.

160
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,142
I'll take you.

161
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:58,512
I- I'm fine. Thank you.

162
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,588
Thank you.

163
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:54,635
He's in neurogenic shock
and he's...

164
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,804
he's still struggling
to breathe.

165
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:59,339
There's still a chance
though, right?

166
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,675
Of course there's still
a chance, Landis.

167
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:04,011
I mean, doc, don't give up,

168
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,713
tell them there's still
a chance.

169
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,715
It's only a matter of time.

170
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,585
No.

171
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:12,753
No.

172
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:13,754
No, no.

173
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:14,487
Come on, I'm right here.

174
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:17,591
I'm-I'm here, I'm right here.

175
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,634
What do you want?

176
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:30,704
I need some help at the church.

177
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:33,607
Sorry, why would I do that?

178
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:39,713
I'm... I'm really sorry
about Nadine.

179
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:41,882
And I wish you knew the truth
about her leaving.

180
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,192
If you wanted me to know
the truth, Doug,

181
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:46,787
then why didn't you
just tell me the truth?

182
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,964
Why didn't anyone tell me
the truth?

183
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:49,990
Why didn't Dan?

184
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:53,661
I know what you're thinkin'.

185
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:56,063
Hell, I've had the same
thoughts myself.

186
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,632
But if you act on 'em,

187
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,801
you're gonna be digging
two graves.

188
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:04,772
One for Dan and
one for yourself.

189
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:07,307
That didn't stop you
from shooting Rodney.

190
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,644
And it didn't bring back
Maggie, either.

191
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:15,248
It changed nothing.

192
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:18,018
I'll be waiting for you
at the church.

193
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:28,929
Is there anything
you can do for him?

194
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,106
Maybe if I was a trauma
specialist

195
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,134
and I had the equipment
that I needed.

196
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:37,805
I did the best I could.

197
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:40,340
Hey, no one's saying you didn't.

198
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,847
It's up to Billy now.

199
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:51,819
We can't let him die.

200
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:53,787
Right?

201
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:57,457
He dies, he turns
into one of those things.

202
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,061
We just hand him over
to the enemy?

203
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:03,931
He deserves better than that.

204
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:14,141
Father!

205
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,747
Carol.

206
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,782
Where are you?

207
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:32,960
I'm coming!

208
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,968
Father!

209
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:42,836
Yes, I'll be there in a minute.

210
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:54,948
Yes?

211
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:55,883
We're done outside.

212
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,126
I thought you'd like to say
a few words.

213
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,752
Yes, of course I will.

214
00:11:58,786 --> 00:11:59,920
Are you alright?

215
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:00,520
I'm fine.

216
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,488
You look ill.

217
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:04,792
Carol, please.

218
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:16,479
I don't know about you
but I could use a drink.

219
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:18,505
Do you even know
what we're doing here?

220
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:21,308
Yeah, I know what we're
doing here, Doug.

221
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:24,011
Ok? It's the same thing that
we did two days ago,

222
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:26,213
and a couple days before that.

223
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,315
I'm getting pretty tired
of burying my friends.

224
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:31,919
You're tired of it but don't
let it become the new normal.

225
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:36,790
Doug.

226
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:38,058
Father.

227
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,429
I want to thank you.

228
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:45,866
I want to thank all of you
for volunteering.

229
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,110
Neighbours and family
and friends,

230
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:50,370
they deserve a proper burial.

231
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:53,440
So thank you.

232
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:06,053
May they be granted
eternal rest, dear Lord.

233
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:11,158
May the perpetual light
shine upon them.

234
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:13,961
May their souls rest.

235
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:17,898
Mercy of God and peace.

236
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:32,012
That's it?

237
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,514
He's not feeling well.

238
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,550
I don't think there's much
left to say.

239
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:40,520
You just got mad at me
for wanting a drink.

240
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:48,896
There's drinkin', and then
there's drinking appropriately.

241
00:13:58,571 --> 00:13:59,973
Roman.

242
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:04,311
Hey, Roman!

243
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:10,884
For fu sake. I'm a ghost.

244
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,121
What happened to you?

245
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:15,488
I got electrocuted at the dam.

246
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:16,223
Thanks for that.

247
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:17,290
No.

248
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:20,627
No, you don't get to pull
the guilt card on me.

249
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,095
Hey, Roman.

250
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:24,164
I don't understand what's
going on right now.

251
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:28,335
I'm in a coma at Lambda
and I'm standing right here

252
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,470
talking to you at the exact
same time.

253
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:33,106
Like, what the fu?

254
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,908
You're dead, Billy.

255
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:38,111
Get used to it.

256
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,987
Where's mommy M?

257
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,021
It's this way.

258
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,156
Getting some rest.

259
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:52,492
She was up all morning
helping Uncle Billy get better.

260
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:54,694
Is Uncle Billy gonna die?

261
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,263
We don't know, honey.

262
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:57,264
Of course not.

263
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:58,531
Don't be stupid.

264
00:14:58,565 --> 00:14:59,599
Izzy.

265
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,601
Well, she is.

266
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,236
She knows Uncle Billy
isn't dead,

267
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,272
he's just on vacation
from his body.

268
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:15,415
Abby! Abby!

269
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:15,949
No.

270
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:17,050
No, no, no, no, no.

271
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:18,185
Hey.

272
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:18,952
Not again.

273
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:21,421
You have to keep up.

274
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,490
You can't keep disappearing
on me honey.

275
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,094
I can't be dead.
I can't be dead.

276
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:28,061
I can't be dead.

277
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:29,997
My-my body's hooked up
to a heart monitor,

278
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,231
my heart is beating.

279
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,966
Then you're dying.

280
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,068
It makes sense. You
don't look like them.

281
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,170
How do I get back?

282
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:39,239
I wanna live, Roman.

283
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,383
I wanna hug my nieces, you know?

284
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:42,642
I wanna-I wanna hang
with my sister.

285
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,253
We're actually finally
getting along now.

286
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,612
If I die she's gonna fu kill me.

287
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:47,080
You've gotta help me.

288
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:49,182
I really don't.

289
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:50,550
I'll haunt the shit out of you.

290
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,752
Good luck with that.

291
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,154
There's nothing I can do
for you.

292
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,722
Bullshit!

293
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:56,723
Roman, that's bullshit!

294
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,658
What do you need from me?
What do you want?

295
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,560
What I want you to do
is get out of here!

296
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:04,164
Ok. I've got my own shit
that I have to deal with.

297
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,698
Your mom.

298
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:09,636
Ok. Ok.

299
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:13,340
You wanna know why I ran
your mom out of town?

300
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:15,575
It was to protect her.

301
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,010
Ok?

302
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:18,045
There were people

303
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,247
who were gonna do way worse
to her and to you-

304
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,649
Do you understand
what you did to me?

305
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:24,484
I thought my mom abandoned me.

306
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:27,220
I- I thought that she hated me
and now she's dead

307
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:28,655
and you really need to go.

308
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:29,289
You gotta trust me.

309
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,690
I don't have to trust you!

310
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:31,358
Dude.

311
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:32,725
If you were protecting her,

312
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,594
who were you protecting
her from?

313
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:35,728
It doesn't matter.

314
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:37,297
It does matter!

315
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:53,113
- Do you mind?
- Do you?

316
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:54,390
I'll finish this later, I guess.

317
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:56,015
Yeah, you do that.

318
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,695
Everything alright?

319
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,697
Shut up, Norm.

320
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:14,601
You want one?

321
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,703
I wouldn't say no.

322
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:34,321
Izzy, why did you say
Uncle Billy was on vacation

323
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:38,391
from his body?

324
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,393
Did you see him?

325
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:43,830
No.

326
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:45,832
Did he speak to you?

327
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:46,866
She's just making it up.

328
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,668
I am not.

329
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:51,238
Izzy, it's important
you tell me.

330
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:53,540
You won't believe me.

331
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,842
Why would you say that?

332
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:59,479
You don't believe me
about Abigail.

333
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:08,455
Izzy, can you get a message
to Uncle Billy?

334
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:11,291
I don't know.

335
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:15,262
If you can, if you tell him...

336
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,598
I wanna know everything.

337
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,133
Ok.

338
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:23,803
Your mom, you think she was
just a psychic

339
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,306
with powers and shit
like that, no.

340
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:27,407
She was dark.

341
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,242
She did some really dark shit.

342
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,278
She even blackmailed people.

343
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:33,346
Who?

344
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,747
You?

345
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:35,715
Dan?

346
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:37,684
My old man.

347
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,819
She blackmailed my old man.

348
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:40,953
She didn't wanna do that,

349
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:43,690
try and get one over on Connor
McGrath, but she tried.

350
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:45,758
It didn't work and whatever
she said,

351
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:46,835
it started the whole thing.

352
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,928
Wait, what does that have
to do with-what was it?

353
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:49,862
I don't know.

354
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:52,465
That's why they're called
secrets, Roman.

355
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:54,334
My old man wouldn't tell me.

356
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,702
He didn't want me to know.

357
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:56,812
He didn't want the town to know.

358
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,438
He just wanted your mom gone.

359
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,572
How does Dan fit into it?

360
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:01,841
Well, he drove her to Anchorage
and got her on a plane.

361
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,876
And you saw that happen?

362
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:06,779
Bring it up with Dan.

363
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:09,749
What're you doing with a gun?

364
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:11,718
Roman.

365
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,288
Roman.

366
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,393
Shit.

367
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:22,529
Shit.

368
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:24,764
What is happening to me now?

369
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:25,877
Nothing's happening to you.

370
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,737
You did this to yourself.

371
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:46,786
Happy birthday, Roman.

372
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:50,790
Love, mom.

373
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:53,760
San Francisco is amazing.

374
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:54,794
Love, mom.

375
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,329
I had your best interest
at heart.

376
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:58,565
I wish that you were here
right now with me.

377
00:19:58,598 --> 00:19:59,932
I miss you so much.

378
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,634
Love, mom.

379
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:03,936
I was trying to protect you.

380
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,972
None of it was real!

381
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:09,909
None of it was real.

382
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,812
I hate my mother because of you.

383
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:15,948
I hate my mother because of you.

384
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:18,485
What do you want?

385
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:19,886
Where is she?

386
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,955
Where is she?

387
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,994
I'll take you to her.

388
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:30,330
You've been apart
for long enough.

389
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,470
This ain't a trick, I promise.

390
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,708
I- I don't want this.

391
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:42,875
I wanna live.

392
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,977
Then why are you still here?

393
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:46,779
Jesus, why do you
still sound like

394
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:49,015
a magic fu eight ball?

395
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:53,486
Nadine, help me, please.

396
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,289
Remember when I needed
your help?

397
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:59,892
What kind of man would turn
his back like that?

398
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:02,795
I had nothing to do
with your death.

399
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:04,931
Same old Billy.

400
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:08,034
Now you can reap what you sowed.

401
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:11,904
Please. Please.

402
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:15,408
If you really wanted to live
you'd be there by now.

403
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:16,343
Well, I-I guess I'm here

404
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,945
because I needed your
son's help, right?

405
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:21,047
Just do it, Billy.

406
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,949
Let go.

407
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:24,917
It's easy.

408
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:29,956
And if there's one thing I know,
you always liked easy.

409
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,769
Where the fu am I now?

410
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:05,825
No, no, no.

411
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:09,328
Remember that time we all blew
off school to go see Aerosmith?

412
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:10,430
- Yes.
- In Anchorage?

413
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:12,532
Man, my dad wanted to kill you.

414
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:13,833
That was your idea.

415
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:16,769
And if I had told him that
he would have killed me.

416
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:18,871
How does someone get a drink
around here?

417
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,575
Bar service only.

418
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:23,676
There was, what?

419
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:26,045
There was eight of us jammed
into that motel room.

420
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,547
Mmmhmm.

421
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,483
You, me, Stinky Pete.

422
00:22:31,418 --> 00:22:32,151
Wendell.

423
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:32,952
Yeah.

424
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:37,490
Richard, Kim, Sherry and Andrea.

425
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:40,627
I don't know what your dad
was so mad about.

426
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,795
He thought you were gonna
get me pregnant.

427
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:44,497
Well...

428
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:47,500
Turns out he had nothing
to worry about.

429
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:52,505
Thank you.

430
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:01,481
Enjoy this.

431
00:23:01,514 --> 00:23:04,551
It's the last of the good stuff.

432
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:09,088
You know, I have a bottle
at my place.

433
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:11,390
I'm sure you do.

434
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:17,530
I gotta tell ya.

435
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:20,500
Last night in the church,
it was good to see you.

436
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:22,068
The old Karla.

437
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:23,169
Old?

438
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,071
You know what I mean.

439
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:26,038
The original recipe Karla,

440
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:29,542
not this buttoned up
conservative version.

441
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:32,779
I missed her.

442
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:34,447
Norm.

443
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:37,517
My life's messy enough.

444
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,819
You can't tell me that
everything's perfect.

445
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:42,088
What, me and Paolo?

446
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:43,623
Yeah, that-that wasn't a fight.

447
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:48,561
You should see us fight.

448
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:51,097
You want something else.

449
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:54,100
I can tell.

450
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:56,035
What I want is to forget

451
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:58,671
that I'm living in hell
for a few hours.

452
00:23:58,705 --> 00:24:02,509
I can help you out
with that, too.

453
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:04,977
I'm sure you can.

454
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:10,216
I'm sorry.

455
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:11,050
I'll-I'll come back.

456
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,619
No, it's ok. Stay.

457
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,098
Just didn't want him to be
alone, you know?

458
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:28,100
Thanks.

459
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,104
I wanna live.

460
00:24:34,741 --> 00:24:36,643
I wanna live.

461
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,546
It happened here.

462
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,952
I was driving her to Anchorage.

463
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:22,822
And then?

464
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,624
I got distracted.

465
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:47,747
An accident?

466
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,782
And you didn't-you
didn't tell anyone?

467
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:53,352
Nah, I don't believe you.

468
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:57,790
I was afraid, Roman, and...
I was questioning-

469
00:25:57,824 --> 00:25:59,992
I was questioning my faith.

470
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:07,734
I'd been drinking.

471
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:12,171
And that's not an excuse,
it's an explanation.

472
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:13,740
I never meant to hurt you.

473
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:15,808
I don't believe you.

474
00:26:19,712 --> 00:26:21,047
Do you wanna go?

475
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,114
Yeah.

476
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:23,182
Can you stay?

477
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:24,651
I have to take the girls home

478
00:26:24,684 --> 00:26:27,687
and I don't want him
to be alone, either.

479
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,755
Of course.

480
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:30,657
Thanks.

481
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:33,059
Girls, come on. Let's go.

482
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,683
Billy?

483
00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:01,120
I see you, you know.

484
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,857
Your strength.

485
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,663
And your sweetness.

486
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:23,810
I love you, too.

487
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:27,714
Yeah.

488
00:27:31,117 --> 00:27:33,820
Billy?

489
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:35,822
Hi.

490
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:40,827
Hello?

491
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,897
Father Dan?

492
00:27:44,931 --> 00:27:47,266
Boohoo.

493
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:49,836
I made you some muffins.

494
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:07,887
Thank you, varsity wrestling.

495
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,939
What in the name of the lord...

496
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:57,003
Fu... yeah.

497
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:06,345
Sweet Jesus.

498
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:17,389
Ohhhhhhh!!!!!!

499
00:29:20,893 --> 00:29:22,194
I was so worried.

500
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:26,232
I thought we lost you.

501
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:29,335
Come here.

502
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:38,077
Thanks for never giving up.

503
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:44,083
Did you mean what you said?

504
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:47,186
Did you mean it?

505
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:48,287
You heard that?

506
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,223
I heard it all.

507
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:53,826
Yeah, babe.

508
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,161
Yeah, I meant it.

509
00:29:55,194 --> 00:29:57,029
You had to wait 'til I was
almost dead

510
00:29:57,063 --> 00:29:58,464
before you told me, is that it?

511
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:01,067
Maybe.

512
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:10,176
Awe, you're just a frightened
little girl, aren't you?

513
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,289
What's so funny?

514
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,992
You're pathetic.

515
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:30,930
You're pathetic.

516
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:32,031
Billy.

517
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:34,233
Yeah. It's ok.

518
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:36,602
You reek of it.

519
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:39,305
You reek of pathetic, you know?

520
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:42,141
I mean, look at you.

521
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,343
You're hanging on by a thread.

522
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:48,280
Aren't you?

523
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:52,318
I could never love
someone like that.

524
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:55,254
Why are you doing this?

525
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:57,323
How do you live with yourself

526
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,258
knowing you're responsible
for all this?

527
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:03,229
Every death in this place
has got your name on it.

528
00:31:03,262 --> 00:31:06,999
Every death.
Every death. Every death.

529
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:08,034
You're not Billy.

530
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:09,435
What?

531
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:12,638
You're not Billy.

532
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:16,308
I don't know-I don't know
who you are

533
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:21,380
but whoever's doing this
I know you're not real.

534
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:24,516
You never could take a joke.

535
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,152
Go to hell, Ryan.

536
00:31:26,185 --> 00:31:28,154
I'm already in hell.

537
00:31:28,187 --> 00:31:30,322
And I saved you a seat.

538
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:37,263
There.

539
00:31:39,265 --> 00:31:41,667
That's where I buried her.

540
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:48,583
There's something else
about that day

541
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:50,576
that I haven't told you.

542
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:09,328
How long did she last?

543
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:10,496
Minutes.

544
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:13,465
Nothing I could do to help her.

545
00:32:13,499 --> 00:32:15,034
You don't know that.

546
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:18,037
I offered her absolution,
she refused.

547
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:21,140
Who are you to offer absolution?

548
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:26,212
That's what she said to me.

549
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,147
You killed her.

550
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,715
You know that.

551
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:35,187
That's right.

552
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:37,323
And I'm sorry.

553
00:32:37,356 --> 00:32:39,658
Yeah, well, you don't get
to ask for forgiveness.

554
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:47,691
Even after I dedicated
my life to God, I struggled.

555
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:55,574
I thought that I had failed him.

556
00:32:55,607 --> 00:33:02,381
But then I realized
that he brang me to you.

557
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:06,085
That your power,
that your ability,

558
00:33:06,118 --> 00:33:10,422
is of divine nature and you
are the hand of God, son.

559
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:12,524
I have a gun.

560
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:15,694
Now I have a gun.

561
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,796
Yeah.

562
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,398
Do it.

563
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:21,267
Be my judgment.

564
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:40,319
Mom?

565
00:33:50,296 --> 00:33:53,099
Die.

566
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:54,533
Die.

567
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:57,436
Please... stop...

568
00:33:58,537 --> 00:33:59,671
Hey, asshole.

569
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:01,507
You think you're dead now?

570
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,310
Come here!

571
00:34:05,411 --> 00:34:06,678
Landis, baby.

572
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,114
Shit.

573
00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:09,581
Shit, are you ok?

574
00:34:09,615 --> 00:34:11,517
Are you ok?

575
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,651
Baby?

576
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:14,286
I'm coming.

577
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,187
I'm coming.

578
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:16,722
I'm right here.

579
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,626
I'm right here.

580
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:26,165
Damn you are a sexy fu.

581
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,336
Billy? Billy?

582
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:47,313
Hi.

583
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:50,482
Hey.

584
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:54,453
It's me.

585
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,755
Hi.

586
00:35:56,788 --> 00:36:00,626
What happened?

587
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:03,829
You were electrocuted.

588
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:06,665
At the dam.

589
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:11,237
You-you were in a coma.

590
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:16,775
I think I went
to the other side.

591
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:18,944
What was it like?

592
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,619
Roman?

593
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,589
She says that she's ready
to forgive you.

594
00:37:37,623 --> 00:37:40,859
And she's ready to let go.

595
00:37:44,363 --> 00:37:47,433
Thank you, Nadine.

596
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:49,335
Thank you.

597
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:50,869
I'm not.

598
00:37:52,538 --> 00:37:56,408
If you are looking
for absolution

599
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:58,043
you can find it yourself.

1
00:00:01,369 --> 00:00:01,769
Previously on Ghost Wars...

2
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:02,603
Where is she?!

3
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:04,605
She went outside to play
with Marcus.

4
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:06,574
Honey, Marcus is dead.

5
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:08,042
Abigail!

6
00:00:08,076 --> 00:00:08,709
Abby!

7
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:10,644
I know where Abigail is.

8
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:12,880
Billy, be careful.

9
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:15,449
If this thing isn't paranormal
I don't know what is.

10
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:17,651
They were trying to protect it.

11
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:18,486
Run!

12
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,789
Everyone get out of
the forest, now!

13
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:24,692
I'm going to kill you
and your entire family.

14
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,727
She's not my sister.

15
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,262
Why would you say that?

16
00:00:28,296 --> 00:00:30,231
Because I'm Abigail.

17
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:18,112
What do you guys want?

18
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,715
That's not good.

19
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:56,750
That's really not good.

20
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:25,679
There's gotta be a logical
explanation for this.

21
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:27,315
Well, of course there's
an explanation,

22
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:31,819
the problem is we don't know
what we don't know.

23
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,687
Gosh, how did I not know that?

24
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:37,225
You wanna know why Roman Mercer
repels these things?

25
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:38,835
We need to figure out
what they are first.

26
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:41,862
Or we need to figure out
what Roman Mercer actually is.

27
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:48,236
So Karla said she saw them
in the forest?

28
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:49,513
During the search
for the mayor's kid.

29
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:50,704
Everyone saw them.

30
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:52,973
How does she know it wasn't
just another hallucination?

31
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,376
I guess she doesn't, really.

32
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:56,820
But they sounded similar
in appearance

33
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:00,881
to Roman Mercer's
description of them.

34
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,917
Ok, well we know he repels them,

35
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:06,820
so I guess that's
good enough for now.

36
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:11,825
We know these things
are affected

37
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:14,728
by electromagnetic
fields, right?

38
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:15,963
So...

39
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:20,301
what if Roman's body generates
a unique signature?

40
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:22,503
What if he's a slider?

41
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,339
The series on alternate
realities?

42
00:03:25,373 --> 00:03:28,809
No, it's a term for people
who experience weird phenomenon

43
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:32,746
around electrical appliances
like computers shut down,

44
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,348
watches don't work...

45
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:35,983
We've never seen any of that
around him.

46
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:37,451
Doesn't mean it didn't happen.

47
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:39,920
Just, we haven't documented it.

48
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:43,491
You want Roman Mercer to be
your grand unified theory.

49
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,764
As far as I can tell he's
nothing more than ghost garlic.

50
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:50,531
Wow. I'm sure he would love
that description.

51
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,501
Can I get time off
for good behaviour?

52
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:55,968
Go.

53
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:58,906
Good night.

54
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,974
You too.

55
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:10,518
Alright, Landis, do not fall
asleep here, ok?

56
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:14,021
Just get up, go to
the residences.

57
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:14,955
Ok, Landis.

58
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,791
Just five minutes
then I'll go, I promise.

59
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,900
That's not good.

60
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,972
Ryan!

61
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,044
You.

62
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,713
You are not a hallucination,
are you?

63
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:41,615
Ryan, please.

64
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:44,352
Ryan... Ryan, please!

65
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,395
What the hell is that thing?!

66
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:55,729
My new best friend.

67
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:57,331
Yeah.

68
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,067
You saw them, too, right?

69
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,935
I think we can confirm
the lack of electricity

70
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,771
is making them stronger.

71
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,675
Ok, so if the whole grid is down
then nobody in town is safe.

72
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,377
St. Martin's is safe.

73
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,479
Paolo, there is no scientific
theory to support

74
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:12,480
that religious belief-

75
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:13,757
I installed an emergency
generator for Father Dan

76
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:14,948
a couple of days ago.

77
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,585
Great. Ok, let's go.

78
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:18,752
I'll drop you off.

79
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:19,787
Where are you going?

80
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,997
I need to pick up Karla first.

81
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,022
Paolo.

82
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,491
I know, it's dangerous.

83
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:25,626
No, I was just gonna ask
if I could keep the gun?

84
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,541
Abigail.

85
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,142
What are you doing out here?

86
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,143
Uncle Billy?

87
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,578
What?

88
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:45,513
I saw a ghost in my room.

89
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:47,948
I got scared.

90
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,518
You don't have to be scared,
I'm here now, ok?

91
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:54,822
Ok?

92
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,032
Come on, come on, come on!

93
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,595
Get inside! Get inside!

94
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,068
No, no, no! Get inside!

95
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,503
Get in!

96
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:17,545
Dear god.

97
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,457
Power's out.

98
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,425
Yeah, I noticed.

99
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:33,827
Come on, everyone's going
in the church.

100
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:35,095
You're letting me out?

101
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,930
Yeah, on one condition.

102
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,635
Look, it's either this or
you stay here in the dark.

103
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:43,771
No way in hell are you putting
me in them cuffs.

104
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:44,472
Come on, Doug.

105
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:45,973
This is for your own protection.

106
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:48,776
And a little bit
everyone else's.

107
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,544
Norm?

108
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:51,579
Shit!

109
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,588
You alright?

110
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,823
Hey, are you alright? You ok?

111
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,558
What the hell was that?

112
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:06,460
I don't know.

113
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:09,497
Yeah.

114
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,164
Anything coming at me like
that again,

115
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:14,234
they're gonna know better.

116
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:18,606
Ok, ok...

117
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,208
Ok. Ok.

118
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,645
Alright. I owe you one.

119
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,951
Karla?

120
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,491
Honey?

121
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,677
What the hell are you doing?!

122
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,111
You coulda killed me!

123
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,379
Wait.

124
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:02,883
How do I know you aren't one of
those hallucination... things?

125
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,285
You don't need to refer to it
as a hallucination thing.

126
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,656
You can just call it
a hallucination.

127
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,658
Ok, you're good.

128
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:13,093
No hallucination thing
would be so prissy.

129
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:16,664
Prissy?

130
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:18,999
Relax.

131
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,168
I love that you're
a little priss.

132
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,537
We gotta get out of here.

133
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:31,311
It's crazy out there.

134
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,546
Abby!

135
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,246
Thank god!

136
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,548
Mommy!

137
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:36,449
Where'd you find her?

138
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:39,587
Eagle Ridge Road.
She's fine now.

139
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,921
Where's Marilyn?

140
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,632
I don't know. She went to look
after her patients.

141
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:44,324
She'll be fine.

142
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,693
Can you help me take care
of Izzy?

143
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:46,927
Yeah, sure.

144
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,562
There's more kids back in there.

145
00:08:48,596 --> 00:08:49,697
Thanks.

146
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,032
Come on, honey. Where were you?

147
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,001
We wanna go with
the other kids, too.

148
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,736
Why don't you just keep me
company, peanut?

149
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:56,870
Come on.

150
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:58,071
You think we're so dangerous.

151
00:08:58,105 --> 00:08:59,106
No, no.

152
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,107
We're not.

153
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,775
I know.

154
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:03,577
It was Jed Tucker.

155
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:05,846
He was standing over us
just staring at us.

156
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,281
Father Dan?

157
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:09,950
What's causing this?

158
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,620
I don't know.

159
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,087
But we're safe here.

160
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:15,222
No.

161
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:20,127
No, we're-we're not.

162
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,731
As long as the power's out
nowhere is safe.

163
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:37,778
Dr. Barker. People
are relying on us.

164
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:40,614
Your nihilistic attitude
is not helping.

165
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:42,049
This isn't nihilism.

166
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,684
These entities,

167
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:46,887
these are some kind of
energybased life form.

168
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,022
The town's power grid
was acting as a force field.

169
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:51,058
It was suppressing their power.

170
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:54,361
As long as we stay in places
with electricity we'll be safe.

171
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:55,395
Father, no offense.

172
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,065
I don't wanna live
in the church.

173
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,633
Well, we could if need be.

174
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:01,769
We could live here.

175
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:04,237
Paolo and Roman, they could-

176
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,406
they could help make this place
a safe space.

177
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,608
A place for all of us to be.

178
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:13,914
Until your generator
runs out of gas.

179
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,083
We need to restore the power.

180
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,786
Well, who the hell would be
dumb enough to go to the dam now

181
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:20,921
with all this bullshit going on?

182
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:26,259
I'm gonna need your truck.

183
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,431
Drive up to the gate.

184
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,967
But you gotta walk in
from there.

185
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:36,670
If you're lucky it's just
a breaker problem.

186
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:38,038
That's an easy.

187
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:41,374
But if the turbines are screwed,
so are you.

188
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,744
We're talking hours.

189
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:44,978
Maybe days.

190
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:46,747
You're gonna need me
to go with you.

191
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,315
You might be right.

192
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:49,416
Not happening.

193
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:50,550
Norm, you know.

194
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,953
Val would skin me alive
if I let you out of here. No.

195
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,288
Kiss ass.

196
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,423
I'll go.

197
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:57,691
I think you're needed here-

198
00:10:57,725 --> 00:11:00,293
It's not a debate!

199
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,462
I guess it's decided.

200
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:11,371
Here, you'll need this.

201
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,405
And this.

202
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:14,207
Yeah, Tesla coil gun, nice.

203
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:15,142
You keep it.

204
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,409
We have the generator.

205
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:17,845
You have the generator.

206
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:18,979
We'll be fine.

207
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,080
Come on. We'll be fine.

208
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,281
Here.

209
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:24,852
A physicist, a priest, and
a pirate all went up to a dam.

210
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:27,154
It does have the makings of
a pretty dark joke.

211
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,222
All we need is a medium.

212
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,497
My mother has a flair
for the dramatic.

213
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,734
You shouldn't be out right now,
Dr. Barker.

214
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:43,103
Roman, please. Call me Landis.

215
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:44,104
That's why we're here.

216
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:46,506
We're going to the dam
to restart the power.

217
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,176
And you guys need some
ghost repellant.

218
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,344
Paolo called you "ghost garlic".

219
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:54,748
Yeah, well, I've been
called worse.

220
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:56,016
I know. I'm sorry.

221
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,350
It's just ignorance.

222
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,485
Yeah.

223
00:11:58,518 --> 00:11:59,953
I'll get my stuff.

224
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,268
Who is that?

225
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:19,206
That is-that is my mother.

226
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,375
A client of hers painted it
for her.

227
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,477
It's beautiful.

228
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,781
Do you talk to her?

229
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:30,550
No, not-not since
she bailed on me.

230
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,320
Bailed? She ran away?

231
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:36,523
Well, I-I came home
one afternoon and.

232
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,892
Father Dan was here
and she wasn't.

233
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,463
Where'd she go?

234
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,365
She went to Seattle.

235
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,203
Met a man online.

236
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:52,239
Yeah, well, he wanted her

237
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,507
but not necessarily
her teenaged son.

238
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,976
I- I get it.

239
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:58,578
Forgiveness, right, Father?

240
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,080
Yeah.

241
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,958
You can't stop someone
for doing what they think

242
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:04,484
will make them happy.

243
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:09,056
Um... I just... just assumed
she'd passed away.

244
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:12,826
What made you assume that?

245
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,831
It does it does feel like
that sometimes.

246
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:20,100
Things happen for a reason.

247
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,409
We should get going.

248
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:30,978
Yeah.

249
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:36,884
It's basically a selfcontained
portable lightening machine.

250
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,585
Jessie is dead because of you!

251
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:39,987
Come on, how is this our fault?

252
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,297
You caused the earthquake,
didn't you?

253
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,023
No, that was an unfortunate
coincidence.

254
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,467
You have no evidence
to support that theory.

255
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:45,692
Listen to yourselves!

256
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,603
Jesus Christ, we've got more
important things to worry about.

257
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:49,529
Val... language.

258
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:53,934
He's over eight feet tall,
skin as white as snow.

259
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:58,906
He doesn't have a nose,
eyes, or ears.

260
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:02,375
Just a large gaping mouth
filled with the sharpest teeth

261
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:05,012
you've ever seen.

262
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:07,948
If you're out in the dark,
all alone in the forest,

263
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:09,349
that's when he calls to you.

264
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:16,623
That is not funny.

265
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,525
You hear anyone laughing, Carol?

266
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,062
Whoever's doing that
needs to stop.

267
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,066
It's coming from outside.

268
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:30,270
You'll try to fight it
but you just can't.

269
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:33,240
You'll be drawn to the sound
of the call.

270
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:36,609
When you get close enough,
that's when he...

271
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:57,530
Paolo, what do you see?

272
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:06,106
Don't worry, this is
a sanctuary.

273
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,375
After everything we've seen
I wouldn't be so sure.

274
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,977
Shut up, Norm.

275
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,611
As long as the power's on,
we're safe.

276
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:12,721
Well, how do you know that?

277
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,547
Will you idiots be quiet?

278
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,722
You just said it was safe!

279
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,992
They tried to pull the same shit
on me in the woods.

280
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,435
The power outage
has made them stronger.

281
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:27,660
More physical.

282
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:28,628
So they can beat the shit
out of us

283
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:29,997
on top of scaring us to death?

284
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,398
That's-that's just great.

285
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,509
The closer we are to a power
source the safer we'll be.

286
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,602
We need to build a perimeter.

287
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,504
You're gonna need these.

288
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:40,073
And there's enough
in that basement

289
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,242
to cover the entire sanctuary.

290
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,678
And if you'd have taken the
damn handcuffs off of me before

291
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:47,147
I coulda brought them all up.

292
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,181
I'll see what we've got.

293
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:49,182
Thanks, Carol.

294
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:50,417
Let's go, Norm.

295
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,651
Get these off.

296
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,120
Now!

297
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:59,292
Boys are waiting. Come on, baby.

298
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,397
Wait.

299
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:06,566
What do you know about
Roman's mother?

300
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,567
Nadine?

301
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,435
Yeah.

302
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,270
What do you want to know
about her for?

303
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,704
I saw her presence up at Lambda.

304
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:14,507
Her presence? Like her ghost?

305
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:15,375
Yeah.

306
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:16,409
I don't know.

307
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:19,079
She left over six years ago.

308
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:20,789
How can you be so sure
that's what happened?

309
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,382
Because I made sure she left.

310
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,751
We kicked her out of town.

311
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:25,552
Wait, you what?

312
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:26,419
Yeah, we kicked her out of town.

313
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:28,321
Nadine Mercer, she was
a con artist.

314
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:31,291
She convinced us all
she was psychic.

315
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,792
She played on our emotions.

316
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,394
Even I got sucked in.

317
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:35,462
She was his mother.

318
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,331
No, is. She's still
very much alive.

319
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:39,508
So who's wandering
around Lambda?

320
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:41,577
I don't know. It's probably
one of your hallucinations

321
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,170
you're always going on about,
could be.

322
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:44,471
Come on, come on.

323
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,405
Every single one of those
hallucinations

324
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,107
has been personal to me.

325
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,509
These are past memories,
personal incidents,

326
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,378
Roman's mother means
nothing to me.

327
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:53,380
Good. We should
keep it that way.

328
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:55,048
I'm going.

329
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,485
Somebody should tell him.

330
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,404
Is someone down here?

331
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:39,386
Abigail! What are you
doing down here?

332
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:40,496
I was trying to find
more lights.

333
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,654
I just wanted to help.

334
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:44,657
This area is off limits.

335
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:47,527
Come on. Let's go
up to your mom.

336
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,472
Jesus Christ.

337
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:02,909
How come there are lights
on in here?

338
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:04,644
Because they're backup lights

339
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:06,479
which means they're on a battery

340
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:07,647
which means we gotta hustle.

341
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,449
Don't touch that.

342
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:15,955
How's it going up there?

343
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,759
The the turbines are
full of animal carcasses.

344
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,794
Billy and Roman
are clearing them out.

345
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:24,797
Dan's resetting the breakers
but um...

346
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,366
it's gonna take a while.

347
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:27,900
How long's a while?

348
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:31,371
Depends on how many
volunteers we can get up here.

349
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:32,672
Yeah.

350
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:35,675
Good luck, man.

351
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:39,612
I don't think you're gonna get
many more volunteers tonight.

352
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:41,248
Ok.

353
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:44,384
We're not getting any more
help tonight.

354
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:45,818
Yeah, why am I not surprised?

355
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:48,288
Hey, Landis, can-
can we get a light?

356
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:49,121
A flashlight.

357
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:50,266
Right here. Right here.
Right here.

358
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,393
Right here in the corner.
Jammed as a-as a mother.

359
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,764
Holy shit.

360
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:00,700
Jesus Christ.

361
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:01,834
Hey, Roman.

362
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,771
I um... I was just wondering,
you know, all the years

363
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:07,407
that your mom's been gone.

364
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,476
You ever hear from her?

365
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:10,986
I get the odd card
every once in a while.

366
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,479
I love an odd card once
in a while.

367
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:16,649
You ever think to go
and look for her?

368
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:18,285
Nah, she left for a reason.

369
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:21,220
It's sad.

370
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:24,857
Nah, I mean, look.

371
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,894
I get cash when I need it

372
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:30,430
and I've always had Father Dan,
so...

373
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:32,332
That's nice. It means
it's all good.

374
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:33,566
Everybody needs their mother.

375
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,568
You know what, Roman?

376
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:37,370
It's warm, right?

377
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,539
Roman, let us plug away here.

378
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,642
Why don't you go see how
how Dan's making out?

379
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:43,810
You sure? You guys-

380
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,445
Yeah.

381
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:46,446
Ok.

382
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:47,590
See if he knows what he's doing.

383
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:48,915
Ok.

384
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:51,451
What're you doing?

385
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:52,885
Baby, what're you doing?

386
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,821
What're you bringing up
his mom for?

387
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:55,988
I mean, we got shit to do.

388
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:58,725
Keep your eye on the prize.

389
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:07,800
Yeah, that'll do.

390
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:09,802
That'll do?

391
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:11,070
What?

392
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,081
You did the best you could with
the material you had available.

393
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,708
"You did the best you could"?

394
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:16,976
I'm not judging you.

395
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,913
I may not have a PhD in physics
but at least I'm contributing.

396
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,383
Are you accusing me of sitting
on my ass?

397
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,328
Not you, but I haven't seen
any of your colleagues

398
00:21:25,352 --> 00:21:27,354
lift a finger to help
since they got here.

399
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:29,021
You're kidding, right?

400
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:31,924
Your people literally
bullied them into that corner.

401
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:32,925
You know what?

402
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,861
I'm so tired of this Port Moore
strong bullshit.

403
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:36,696
We earned that title.

404
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,704
This town has survived
every fire, flood, and blizzard

405
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:46,639
that mother nature could
throw at us.

406
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:49,709
Industries shutting down
and every company

407
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:52,712
that's barged in here
trying to take us over.

408
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:58,951
Don't think for one second
that you're the first.

409
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:04,557
This town is full of survivors.

410
00:22:04,591 --> 00:22:06,859
We stick together.

411
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:08,961
You understand?

412
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:14,501
Mommy?

413
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:15,768
Marcus?

414
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,104
Mommy?

415
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:22,642
I'm here.

416
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:28,415
I'm here, Marcus!

417
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:29,749
I'm here!

418
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:31,451
Woah, woah, Sophia.

419
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:32,151
Let me go!

420
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:32,985
Sophia.

421
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:33,886
Please!

422
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,821
Marcus, I'm coming!

423
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:35,822
Sophia, dammit!

424
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:36,989
Stay inside!

425
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:37,957
Randeen?

426
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,091
Jesse?

427
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,827
Randeen.

428
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,761
Mommy?

429
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:42,805
Hang on, sweetie, hang on!

430
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:43,829
Randeen!

431
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:51,771
Hey.

432
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:52,939
There you are.

433
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:55,442
You you need a hand?

434
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:58,077
I'm done.

435
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:03,015
I'm I'm surprised
that you're here.

436
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,519
Who are you hiding from?

437
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:08,488
It's that obvious?

438
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:14,894
Well, it's just that your church
is full of terrified people

439
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:18,865
and yet you're here.

440
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:23,169
Well, I could say that there
are many ways

441
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:27,574
for a shepherd to protect
a flock, you know.

442
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:28,875
I won't.

443
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,911
I'll just tell you the truth.

444
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:35,915
I just thought I'd be more
help here.

445
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:38,718
Father, about Marcus.

446
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,920
You didn't... you did your best.

447
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:42,121
No.

448
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:47,794
You can't take back
what happened.

449
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:50,029
You can't outrun your problems.

450
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:52,499
They always come back.

451
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:53,866
Look at me. Look at mom.

452
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:59,038
I mean... I'm living proof.

453
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:06,913
Roman, you know that that...

454
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:10,817
had nothing to do
with her not loving you.

455
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,885
You know that.

456
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,590
Thank you.

457
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:20,893
You're here and she's not.

458
00:24:20,927 --> 00:24:23,195
So... thanks.

459
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:31,838
We should go.

460
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:33,239
Yeah.

461
00:24:38,745 --> 00:24:40,913
What's up?

462
00:24:40,947 --> 00:24:44,116
No, I you go-you go on ahead.

463
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,653
Don't worry about me.

464
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:47,286
Are you sure?

465
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,287
Yeah.

466
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,255
Yeah, go-go on ahead.

467
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:50,857
Billy needs you.

468
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:05,738
Maggie?

469
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,714
You're not a hallucination.

470
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:16,716
I can see through
their hallucinations.

471
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:20,052
And yet here I am.

472
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:21,988
Are you trapped?

473
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:22,989
Are you trapped like them?

474
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,592
I'm not like them.

475
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:28,260
Even with all of your gifts

476
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:29,662
you're still unable
to comprehend

477
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:31,097
what's going on here.

478
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,932
I know what's happening here,
Maggie.

479
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:34,601
People are dying.

480
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:36,836
How can you of all people
talk about life and death

481
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:40,773
like it's something finite?

482
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:45,612
I was so wrapped up
in my own drama that...

483
00:25:45,645 --> 00:25:48,748
I couldn't appreciate what I am.

484
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:53,920
I'm not alone anymore, Roman.

485
00:25:53,953 --> 00:25:55,888
I'm connected.

486
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,328
We're all connected.

487
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:08,768
Don't restart the power.

488
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:10,670
It makes it harder
to communicate.

489
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:12,038
We're talking now.

490
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,740
Not talk.

491
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:18,144
Communicate.

492
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:20,279
Let me show you.

493
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:21,981
It's actually pretty cool.

494
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,023
You put that back!

495
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:32,725
You have no right to do this!

496
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:33,926
Back off!

497
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,838
After everything you've done
to this town, to our father?

498
00:26:35,862 --> 00:26:37,697
We have every right.

499
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,766
I gave him peace of mind!

500
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:41,367
You call that robbing him blind.

501
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,836
From what Trevor's told me,
your father's an expert at that.

502
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:46,138
No, no. You don't get to use
our brother anymore.

503
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:48,140
Why do you think he told me
those things?

504
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:50,309
He wanted your father
to change his ways.

505
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,278
To atone for his crimes here
so he wouldn't have

506
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:53,813
to answer to them
in the next life!

507
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:54,847
Bitch!

508
00:26:57,249 --> 00:26:59,051
You think you're being heroes.

509
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:00,720
You're hypocrites.

510
00:27:00,753 --> 00:27:02,121
Thieves, the lot of you!

511
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:03,790
You can leave now!

512
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:04,924
What about Roman?

513
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,993
What about my son?

514
00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:09,161
Roman will be better
off without you.

515
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,365
You're not fit to be his mother.

516
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,640
Is that-was that real?

517
00:27:21,674 --> 00:27:24,176
How do you know that
that happened?

518
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,144
I was there.

519
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:27,179
And you didn't tell me?

520
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:28,881
Like I was gonna tell you
that my father

521
00:27:28,915 --> 00:27:31,951
helped run your mother
out of town.

522
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,320
Because I'm the only person
you can talk to.

523
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:43,162
My mother, Maggie, where is she?

524
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:44,797
Where is she?

525
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:47,700
She's dead.

526
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:01,748
What happened to her next,
Maggie?

527
00:28:01,781 --> 00:28:02,815
I don't know.

528
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:03,916
What happens next?

529
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,217
I don't know. I wasn't there.

530
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,799
Mommy, I'm cold?

531
00:28:19,832 --> 00:28:21,267
Hang on, Marcus! Hang on!

532
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,268
Randeen? Where are you?

533
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:24,470
I'm coming, baby!

534
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:25,404
Winston, please...

535
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:26,305
Honey?

536
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:28,074
Come on, baby!

537
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:30,242
I want to be with him!

538
00:28:30,276 --> 00:28:30,877
Hey!

539
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:31,778
Randeen!

540
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:34,446
It's not the Jesse you know.

541
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,915
Stay with me.

542
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:36,983
That's it.

543
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:38,851
Stay with me.

544
00:28:43,923 --> 00:28:45,758
I keep thinking I hear a voice.

545
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:47,126
Marilyn?

546
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,394
Trust me.

547
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:51,263
The fact that you can't
is a good thing.

548
00:28:51,297 --> 00:28:54,200
Psalm 51.

549
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,435
It hasn't gotten that bad yet.

550
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:01,941
Mother Mary.

551
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:06,846
Atta boy, pull it, pull it hard.

552
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,351
What did you do to her?

553
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:13,419
Roman-

554
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:14,153
What happened to her?

555
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:14,887
What did you do to my mother?

556
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:16,322
What did you do to her, Father?

557
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:17,824
What did you do to my mother?!

558
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:19,234
What're you doing?
What're you doing?

559
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:19,859
Get off.

560
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:21,193
Stop!

561
00:29:21,227 --> 00:29:22,361
Listen to me.

562
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:24,163
She's dead, isn't she?

563
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:25,832
She's dead.

564
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,200
Isn't she?!

565
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:33,873
Yes. Yes.

566
00:29:33,906 --> 00:29:35,241
She is.

567
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,879
You were there.

568
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:40,813
I saw you.

569
00:29:40,847 --> 00:29:43,015
I'm sorry.

570
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:45,051
Roman, I'm sorry.

571
00:29:48,855 --> 00:29:51,190
Liar!

572
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:52,424
Wait-wait a second, Roman.

573
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,526
Wait. Hang on.

574
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,262
This is not the way it went
down, alright?

575
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,197
Nadine, she just left.

576
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,942
Yeah, we packed her up
and moved her on her way

577
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:03,302
but she was very much alive
last time we saw her.

578
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:05,137
He's telling the truth.

579
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:10,042
I saw her ghost.

580
00:30:10,076 --> 00:30:11,543
At Lambda.

581
00:30:11,577 --> 00:30:12,945
The portrait.

582
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:15,647
Yeah.

583
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:17,559
And-and that's- and that's why
you didn't say anything

584
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,261
'cause you needed your
ghost garlic, right?

585
00:30:19,285 --> 00:30:21,420
All of you needed me!

586
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:24,423
I'm sorry, Roman.

587
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:25,424
God.

588
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:26,893
Please, Roman, don't go.

589
00:30:26,926 --> 00:30:28,527
Fuck you!

590
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:34,934
Fuck all of you.

591
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:39,071
I hope hell comes for you.
All of you.

592
00:30:39,105 --> 00:30:39,939
Come on.

593
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:42,174
Leave him. He's had enough done
to him.

594
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:51,550
Ok, Dan.

595
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,619
What the hell happened
to Nadine?

596
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:00,226
There's not much left.

597
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:01,369
We should have moved
everyone downstairs

598
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:02,461
when we had the chance.

599
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:03,605
That's like a trap
waiting to happen.

600
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:04,630
Come on, be rational.

601
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:05,631
What?

602
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:08,334
Ok, we're in eco mode now.

603
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,002
If we're lucky we got
a few more minutes.

604
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:11,170
There's an eco mode?

605
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,638
Yeah. Way to go.

606
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:13,639
Seriously?

607
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:14,573
Yes, seriously.

608
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:15,407
This is insane!

609
00:31:15,441 --> 00:31:18,077
Enough! Both of ya!

610
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:20,312
Mother.

611
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:21,513
Shit.

612
00:31:27,954 --> 00:31:29,088
What happened?

613
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:29,788
He did it.

614
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:31,924
I saw him cut the power cord.

615
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:32,824
I did not.

616
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:34,369
You endangered my daughters,
you idiot!

617
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,495
I didn't do it!

618
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:37,596
I was talking to Death.

619
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:38,931
She wouldn't hurt me.

620
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:46,238
Blast her!

621
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,428
We gotta pick it up. Pick it up.

622
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,687
Roman's gone.
We're in danger now.

623
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:37,256
Look.

624
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,190
- Jesus.
- Danny.

625
00:32:38,224 --> 00:32:38,657
Look.

626
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,458
Danny!

627
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:40,326
I don't know what happened, ok?

628
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:41,027
But right now we have
to concentrate

629
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,562
on getting out of here alive.

630
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:46,232
Paolo?

631
00:32:47,366 --> 00:32:50,269
And the Lord was sorry that
he had made man on Earth

632
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:53,372
and it grieved him to his heart.

633
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:54,773
Danny, we need more
than prayers.

634
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,342
The screams are from the church.

635
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:57,376
They need our help.

636
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:58,277
They need our help, Danny.

637
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,346
Come on. Come on.

638
00:33:00,379 --> 00:33:03,282
It's gotta be almost empty now.

639
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,317
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

640
00:33:06,285 --> 00:33:08,220
Somebody fix that power cord!

641
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,223
Over there!

642
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:13,325
My God!

643
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:30,176
My God!

644
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:31,477
What's happening?

645
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,257
Mommy?

646
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:47,559
I'm here Mommy!

647
00:33:47,593 --> 00:33:48,794
Marcus?

648
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:51,097
Mommy!

649
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:04,610
Marcus?

650
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:07,146
Sweetheart?

651
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:09,481
Come back to me.

652
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:10,782
Hide and seek, mommy.

653
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,618
Come and find me.

654
00:34:47,486 --> 00:34:49,355
Touch it, mommy.

655
00:34:49,388 --> 00:34:51,823
Then we can be together.

656
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:54,393
And play hide and seek.

657
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:07,573
Tag! You're it!

658
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:13,912
Now, go!

659
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:16,415
Pull it.

660
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:16,848
Back up.

661
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:17,882
Pull it.

662
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:20,752
Christ, it's cold.

663
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,288
Shit!

664
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:23,389
Nah, it's still stuck.

665
00:35:23,422 --> 00:35:25,491
Why won't this thing turn?

666
00:35:25,524 --> 00:35:27,459
There's an antler.

667
00:35:27,493 --> 00:35:28,527
What do we do?

668
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,861
We clean out the other turbine?

669
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:30,662
No, we can't.

670
00:35:30,696 --> 00:35:33,699
We don't have time
to start over.

671
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:35,234
Hey, Father.

672
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:37,803
Anything you'd like to confess?

673
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:39,405
Shit.

674
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:41,373
You stay here. It's me he wants.

675
00:35:41,407 --> 00:35:42,374
Keep going.

676
00:35:42,408 --> 00:35:43,375
No, Danny. Come on.

677
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:44,410
I'll take care of it.

678
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:45,477
Danny, come on.

679
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:46,878
Shit.

680
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:49,815
Shine it down deep. Really deep.

681
00:36:06,732 --> 00:36:11,970
Are you ready to face
what you've done, Father?

682
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:16,508
Are you ready to face what
you've done, Father?

683
00:36:16,542 --> 00:36:19,578
We do not fight against
flesh and blood,

684
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:23,349
but against the powers that
control this present darkness.

685
00:36:23,382 --> 00:36:26,418
Against the spiritual forces
of evil.

686
00:36:26,452 --> 00:36:31,823
Are you ready to face
what you've done, Father?

687
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:36,262
Marcus. Stay with me.

688
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:37,563
Stay.

689
00:36:58,717 --> 00:36:59,717
Come on, baby.

690
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,331
Yes!

691
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:24,676
Yes!

692
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,401
Nothing's happening.

693
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:51,737
It's-it's just building up
pressure, baby.

694
00:38:05,351 --> 00:38:06,585
Boy.

695
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:13,791
Ok, Billy.

696
00:38:15,361 --> 00:38:16,728
You gotta run.

697
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:18,397
You're faster than me, ok?

698
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,632
Just save yourself.

699
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,701
That's what they want.

700
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:27,739
Baby, we're gonna die,
aren't we?

701
00:38:27,773 --> 00:38:29,408
Probably.

702
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,613
God, you-you couldn't
sugar coat it just a little?

703
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:37,849
What's the point?

704
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:41,887
But I'll be damned if I'm
gonna waste my last few seconds

705
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,955
thinking about them assholes.

706
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:47,626
I'm so cold, baby.

707
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:48,494
Awe.

708
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:49,060
I'm so cold.

709
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:50,596
Close your eyes, baby.

710
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:51,497
Don't look.

711
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,998
Close your eyes.

712
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:57,803
Don't worry.

713
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,104
Billy...

714
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:01,973
I love you, too.

715
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:03,642
I love you.

716
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,953
Baby.

717
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:16,988
Baby, it's working.

718
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:24,830
My god, it's working.

719
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:25,664
It's working.

720
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,733
The dam is on, baby.

721
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:28,767
It's on.

722
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,403
We did it. We did it.

723
00:39:37,676 --> 00:39:38,810
Fuck sakes.

724
00:40:08,807 --> 00:40:09,841
Everyone, listen.

725
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:10,709
We don't have much time.

726
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,511
Let's let's gather
all the cables

727
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,555
and move down to the cellar.

728
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:16,047
We can protect more people
in a smaller space.

729
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:17,449
We've lost too many already.

730
00:40:17,483 --> 00:40:19,050
Wait.

731
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:21,520
How many of your people
have been taken tonight?

732
00:40:21,553 --> 00:40:22,721
Yeah, what about Jesse?

733
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,523
You guys are actually
keeping score now?

734
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:25,867
You Lambda folk sure act
like your lives

735
00:40:25,891 --> 00:40:26,825
are more important than ours.

736
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:27,759
Val, you need to do
something about this.

737
00:40:27,793 --> 00:40:29,761
No, you need to do
something about this.

738
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:31,497
I'm taking care of my girls.

739
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,067
People died here tonight.

740
00:40:37,803 --> 00:40:41,106
It doesn't matter who.

741
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:44,042
As long as you keep counting

742
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:48,780
and don't come up
with a game plan,

743
00:40:48,814 --> 00:40:51,216
we're gonna lose
a hell of a lot more.

744
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,756
Ok, fine.

745
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,559
Move everybody to the front,

746
00:41:00,592 --> 00:41:03,094
beef up the wiring
on all the windows,

747
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:06,064
grab everything electric
that's not nailed down.

748
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:14,272
What the hell are you people
waitin' on?

749
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,007
Benediction?

750
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,142
Yes.

751
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:19,177
Isaiah 41:10 says-

752
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,859
Billy, about
what you said before?

753
00:41:33,892 --> 00:41:36,528
Yeah? Yeah?

754
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:40,498
What's happening?

755
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:41,867
Wow, you know what?

756
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,734
You know what, baby?

757
00:41:42,768 --> 00:41:43,835
The town...

758
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:46,572
the town's drawing too much
power for one generator.

759
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:47,272
No, no, no.

760
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:47,839
We can't override the system.

761
00:41:47,873 --> 00:41:48,674
This is major demand.

762
00:41:48,707 --> 00:41:49,641
This is gonna burn out
the turbine.

763
00:41:49,675 --> 00:41:51,943
It's ok, it's ok. I got this,
I got this.

764
00:41:51,977 --> 00:41:53,879
I'm gonna shut off two
of the smaller grids.

765
00:41:53,912 --> 00:41:55,046
Paolo? Paolo?

766
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,782
You need to tell me when you-

767
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:05,857
Billy! Billy!

768
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:12,964
I know you're weary baby.

769
00:42:12,998 --> 00:42:14,733
I know you're...

770
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:18,069
Come on, Billy stay with me,
stay with me.

771
00:42:18,103 --> 00:42:23,208
trappings of this life...

772
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:29,648
Have your heart
turn it on...

773
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:33,018
There must be
a better way...

1
00:00:00,568 --> 00:00:01,648
Previously on Ghost Wars...

2
00:00:02,103 --> 00:00:04,605
They'll come at you
and I can't protect you.

3
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:07,175
You leave town right now
or we'll do things

4
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:08,509
the oldfashioned way.

5
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:09,777
Just take him in.

6
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,179
Come on, Doug.

7
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:11,612
Stop it.

8
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:12,346
Let's go.

9
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,382
You're damning us all to hell.

10
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:16,517
He's just not acting
like himself.

11
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,520
Marcus is showing definite signs
of demonic possession.

12
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,521
Marcus!

13
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,194
Cast out every onslaught
of infernal adversaries!

14
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:31,599
You killed him.

15
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:46,754
They're not my best.

16
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,423
Normally I use butter but we're
practically on war rations

17
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:50,591
so I had to use apple sauce.

18
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,760
It's only a week expired.

19
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:53,627
Wow, these look delicious.

20
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:55,363
Thank you, Carol.

21
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:57,465
Listen, there was something

22
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:59,533
I was hoping you could
help me with.

23
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:02,670
So I need someone who can keep
an eye on things.

24
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:06,440
Keep me informed
about what's going on.

25
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:08,609
You want me to spy on people?

26
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,110
No, no.

27
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,012
Think of it more like
a neighbourhood watch.

28
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:12,746
Yeah.

29
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,780
Yeah.

30
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:21,655
Winston!

31
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:22,723
Hey, Doug.

32
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:26,560
Why are you closed in
the middle of the afternoon?

33
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:28,729
Nothing left to sell.

34
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:32,366
Lambda swooped in after
the 'quake and cleaned me out.

35
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,035
Can't exactly get
any stock in, either.

36
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,571
But you're one of
the only stores in town.

37
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:38,939
Not anymore.

38
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,648
Sophia.

39
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,583
I'm sorry to hear about Marcus.

40
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:58,492
Do you have a wrench?

41
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:00,528
I just need the blood to stop.

42
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:10,604
Sophia.

43
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:12,440
It's not blood, it's rust.

44
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:17,778
Your pipes are really clogged,

45
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:21,782
but if I put some new filters
in all your taps

46
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,627
then you won't have
to walk around in the street

47
00:06:23,651 --> 00:06:25,085
looking like Bloody Mary.

48
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:28,456
Ok?

49
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:29,923
Thank you.

50
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,599
I got you now you mother-

51
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,482
Roman, there's
someone I wanna talk to.

52
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:29,349
Let me guess.

53
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,985
You're having
communication issues.

54
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,487
Obviously.

55
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:34,488
Well, these new ghosts,

56
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:35,155
they don't wanna have anything
to do with me.

57
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,557
They don't wanna talk to me.

58
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,525
You should be happy about that.

59
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:38,726
Well, I need to know.

60
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,062
I need to know what they want
so I can try to fix this.

61
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,531
I can't help you.

62
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:44,832
Sorry.

63
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,541
Shh.

64
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,481
Jesus!

65
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,913
Told you.

66
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,616
Let's get a pry bar, Rodney.

67
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:36,650
Alright.

68
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:38,619
You may wanna move.

69
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,287
I'm not moving.

70
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,723
This is my spot.

71
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:45,058
Besides, anything gets in
my food it's free, right?

72
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:46,259
Pain in the ass.

73
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:47,661
Be careful.

74
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:51,599
What the hell?

75
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:53,601
Jesus Christ!

76
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:54,768
Yeah, that's weird.

77
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:57,037
How is that possible?

78
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,239
I heard about this.

79
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,274
Bunch of rats get their tails
all twisted together

80
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:04,912
and then they die
because they can't get apart.

81
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:09,116
This is considered
a very bad omen.

82
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,752
I hear Lambda's up there running
secret experiments

83
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,954
on this town.

84
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,131
After what happened to Marcus

85
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:19,693
it's gotta be some kind of
end of times biblical shit.

86
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:22,696
Apparently Sophia's
cracking up, too.

87
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,799
She drained Marcus's body
and bathed in the blood.

88
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,901
Who told you that?

89
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:30,137
Bake sale Carol.

90
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,805
Are people still calling
me that?

91
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,750
Everybody should just shut
their collective mouths

92
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:34,942
and stop speculating.

93
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,944
We all need to quit ignoring
the obvious.

94
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,946
This town is haunted.

95
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,648
Norman.

96
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:41,849
That's a load of bull.

97
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,827
Remember that old ghost story
that they used to tell us

98
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:44,852
when we were kids?

99
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:45,919
The whistling man?

100
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:46,654
Come on!

101
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:47,721
I've been hearing-

102
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:48,421
What a load of crap.

103
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:49,690
And not to mention blasphemy.

104
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:50,824
No, no, no. I'm serious.

105
00:09:50,858 --> 00:09:52,335
My aunt's second husband
saw him once.

106
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:53,326
Well, let me guess.

107
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,361
He was whistling.

108
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:56,864
Jesus!

109
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:58,866
What the hell, Carla?!

110
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,033
Rodney, are you alright?

111
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:05,939
There's a bunch of exposed wires
up there.

112
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:08,709
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

113
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:12,880
Be careful, Carla.

114
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:18,819
I swear I've never seen
these before.

115
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:21,789
No wonder those rats were
so fried.

116
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:22,956
How're you doin'?

117
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:23,757
I'm alright.

118
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:24,792
I think I need a beer.

119
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:31,098
Carol?

120
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,866
People are starting to gather
out there.

121
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,868
You sure we can't do this
in here?

122
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:37,805
Sophia was adamant it
not be in the church.

123
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:39,707
After what happened
I don't blame her.

124
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,374
It wasn't the Father's fault.

125
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,143
I'm not saying it was.

126
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,714
So how's the neighbourhood
watch going?

127
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:48,048
Is there anything to report?

128
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:50,818
Yes, a lot.

129
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,219
Great.

130
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:56,256
Thank you.

131
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,289
Um...

132
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:01,695
Darcy May is pregnant?

133
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:03,263
And keeping it.

134
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:05,799
This isn't exactly what
I had in mind.

135
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,769
I've been busy scraping
Rodney Doyle off the floor

136
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:10,479
after he electrocuted himself
at the Chieftan.

137
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,604
He what?

138
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:14,007
He was extricating some
rat monster from the ceiling.

139
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,109
And you didn't think
to add that to the list?

140
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,812
It's fine.

141
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:20,180
Thank you.

142
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,382
You're doing a great job, Carol.

143
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,759
Everyone's staring at me.

144
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:34,394
They all must think
I'm a terrible mother.

145
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,396
No one thinks that, Sophia.

146
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:40,100
They've all come here
to grieve with you.

147
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:43,804
What happened to Marcus
is not your fault.

148
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:45,939
I couldn't protect my son.

149
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:58,218
Marcus, he misses you, too.

150
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:20,340
Thank you all for coming.

151
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:23,777
Before I turn things over
to Carol

152
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:27,380
I'd like to say a few things.

153
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:32,185
I know this is a sad day
for all of us.

154
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:35,455
But even in the face of tragedy

155
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:41,294
we're still the same people
we were before.

156
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:47,400
We stick together and we support
each other no matter what.

157
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:56,810
So let's come together now
and support Sophia

158
00:12:56,844 --> 00:13:00,380
by remembering what a great kid
Marcus was.

159
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,353
Carol?

160
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:08,088
Thank you.

161
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:13,226
A reading from
the Book of Wisdom.

162
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,429
"The souls of the just are
in the hands of God,"

163
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,498
"and no torment
shall touch them."

164
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:32,612
"They seem, in the view
of the foolish, to be dead"

165
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,645
"and their passing away
was thought an affliction."

166
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:40,287
Marcus?

167
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,534
Jesus Mary and Joseph.

168
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:55,936
My god!

169
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,437
My god!

170
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,537
Coward.

171
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,979
Hey, Rodney. Come on in.

172
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:49,456
So how was the funeral?

173
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:54,194
It was a total shit show,
actually.

174
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,363
A lot of weird stuff went down.

175
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,531
Coffin opened up.

176
00:14:58,565 --> 00:14:59,599
Everyone went nuts.

177
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:03,103
It was-it was pretty f@♪$ed up.

178
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:08,441
Well, Sophia shouldn't have
to go through that.

179
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:08,976
Nope.

180
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,377
You got a new batch?

181
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,711
Yeah. Yeah.

182
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,712
Reinforcements.

183
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,746
Good.

184
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,516
I hope this batch is better
than the last one.

185
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:19,419
I think the last one
had sand in it.

186
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:22,089
Poor Sophia.

187
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:24,457
She deserved better than that.

188
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:27,961
Are you ok?

189
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:30,964
I want you to tell me
about the wiring.

190
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:32,075
I don't-I don't have a clue
what you're-

191
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:34,267
The exposed wiring
above the bar?

192
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:37,270
Rodney almost electrocuted
himself doing some repairs.

193
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,373
I never thought anyone
would look up there.

194
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:42,042
What the hell is going on?

195
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:43,410
It's electrical currents.

196
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,979
We figured out that it keeps
these things away.

197
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:50,417
So... only Lambda knows
about this?

198
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,451
Yeah.

199
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,087
What about the rest of the town?

200
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:57,624
Well, there's not enough
supplies at Lambda

201
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:59,426
for the whole town, ok?

202
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,270
So I-I shouldn't have even
taken the ones I did.

203
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,129
You're unbelievable.

204
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:03,522
I was just trying to keep
you safe.

205
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:09,502
I need your help.

206
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:11,304
Maggie, please don't
ask me again.

207
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:13,006
I'm out of options, Roman.

208
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,041
I'm torturing him.

209
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:14,874
I can tell.

210
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,344
I can't go up to Doug Rennie
and say

211
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:19,446
"hey, I got a message
from your dead daughter."

212
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,480
That's not gonna happen.

213
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:21,781
This is important.

214
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,483
And you're just being a baby.

215
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,385
You don't get it.

216
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,187
People loved you.

217
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,156
They're scared of me.

218
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:30,723
My dad needs you.

219
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,259
Not him. Please, not him.

220
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:33,026
Anyone but him.

221
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,161
I'm not a saint.

222
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:36,496
Then you're no better
than he is.

223
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:37,673
The kind of person you choose
to be

224
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:40,367
is the one thing
you have control over.

225
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,270
You were given a gift
for a reason, Roman.

226
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:46,273
Now's your chance to use it,
before it's too late.

227
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:50,743
Before all you have is regret.

228
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:52,379
You think you get death?

229
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,615
You don't.

230
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,455
If you help me I'll...

231
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:04,757
I'll tell you more
about the others.

232
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,784
I want to go on record saying
this is a bad idea.

233
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,425
Maggie, this is a very bad idea.

234
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:44,431
I could shoot you for
trespassing, you know.

235
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,299
Just stay calm.

236
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,600
I have a message for you.

237
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,102
He can smell fear.

238
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:51,138
Who in the hell would be
stupid enough

239
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:55,642
to send you over here
with a message for me?

240
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:56,743
Your daughter.

241
00:17:56,776 --> 00:18:00,380
You get the hell off my property
and you get off now!

242
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,348
This is about Maggie, ok?

243
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:02,391
Tell him to stop being a dick.

244
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,783
She's worried about you.

245
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,027
Listen. I said tell him to stop
being a dick.

246
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,695
Hey. I didn't buy this hippy
voodoo shit from your mother...

247
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,554
Roman tell him!

248
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,631
So you think I'm gonna
buy it from you?

249
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:09,756
Not a prayer.

250
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:14,194
Ok. I-I-she says that
you should stop being a dick.

251
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:14,827
What did you...

252
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:15,795
His middle name is Herman.

253
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:16,463
Just say to me?!

254
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:17,029
Your middle name is Herman.

255
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:17,864
What did you just say?

256
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:20,367
Your middle name is Herman,
right?

257
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,868
Am I right?

258
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:27,474
How did you know that?

259
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:30,810
I'm just trying to help you,
you bigot.

260
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:31,843
Roman.

261
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:33,580
Go.

262
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,349
You wanna see a bigot put
a hole in your head?

263
00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:37,383
Go.

264
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,518
Now!

265
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:39,662
Maggie says that she loves you.

266
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:41,754
You get the f@♪$ outta here!

267
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:48,895
You stupid f@♪$!

268
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:20,460
Closin' up, hon.

269
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,493
Time to go.

270
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:28,901
What?

271
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:30,803
You want me to give you a ride?

272
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,175
No.

273
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:39,679
I'm walking.

274
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,792
Alright.

275
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:55,328
No funny business.

276
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:24,257
What did I just say?

277
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,049
What are you looking at,
Winston?

278
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,451
Don't look at my cards.

279
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:56,088
I'm getting antsy here.

280
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:57,524
Don't touch until we're done.

281
00:20:57,557 --> 00:20:58,491
Hey, Maggie.

282
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:00,360
Hey! Maggie.

283
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:01,828
Hey, dad.

284
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:02,895
Guys.

285
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:03,730
Hey, come on and have a drink
with the old dad.

286
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:04,564
Come and play
some cards with us.

287
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,533
You can't afford to lose
to me again.

288
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,668
I want my money back
is what's what.

289
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:10,036
Come on.

290
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:17,043
Shots, shots, shots,
shots, shots, shots!

291
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:26,553
Yeah!

292
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,423
Mags?

293
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,732
Maggie?

294
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:42,001
Maggie?

295
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,704
Come on.

296
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:47,039
Come on.

297
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:48,608
Mags.

298
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:57,550
Mags.

299
00:21:57,584 --> 00:21:59,085
Mags?

300
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,597
Mag-Mags?

301
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:13,099
Mags?

302
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:19,906
Ma-Mags?

303
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:24,777
Maggie?

304
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:26,946
Maggie?

305
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,084
Maggie?

306
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:36,789
Maggie.

307
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:07,720
You look like shit, Doug.

308
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:09,388
A little hair of the dog, Doug?

309
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:14,526
Hey.

310
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,205
I heard he's been offering
his spooky services

311
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,899
to people in exchange
for supplies.

312
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:21,167
Come on, man.

313
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,969
He's not that bad.

314
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:24,003
Whatever.

315
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:25,004
What, man?

316
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:26,405
He saved my life.

317
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,234
I need your help.

318
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,105
I'm begging you.

319
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:43,549
What is that?

320
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:47,620
What is that?

321
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,488
It's a Ouija board.

322
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:54,160
I know we have to summon her
or something.

323
00:24:56,596 --> 00:24:57,830
She's already here.

324
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,669
She wishes that you would
quit smoking.

325
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:16,683
And I guess she wants me
to stop drinking, too, right?

326
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:18,517
She's a realist.

327
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,958
How do I know she's really here?

328
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,029
Where?

329
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,233
One second.

330
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:39,305
She stole a watch from you.

331
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:41,307
Um, where?

332
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,009
She stole a watch from you.

333
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:45,311
She thought you were gonna
get drunk and pawn it off

334
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:48,781
so she hid it underneath here.

335
00:25:56,823 --> 00:25:57,990
Here.

336
00:26:00,827 --> 00:26:04,797
She says she's sorry about
missing Friday night pizza.

337
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:34,794
It's not her fault.

338
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,800
Will you tell her
it's not her fault?

339
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,802
You just did.

340
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:44,771
She can hear me?

341
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:51,310
Are you telling me the truth?

342
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,212
Yeah. Just talk.

343
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
Maggie.

344
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:17,770
Maggie.

345
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:34,353
Maggie, the first thing you need
to know is that it's my fault.

346
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:41,928
That night you came in and
we were all drinkin', and I...

347
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:52,138
I gave you some and...

348
00:27:57,343 --> 00:28:01,313
I just kept drinking and I
didn't pay any attention to you.

349
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,118
She doesn't understand.

350
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:09,421
You need to tell her.

351
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:11,123
It's my fault.

352
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:17,096
Doug. Doug!

353
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:18,397
Hey, hey, hey!

354
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,298
Hey.

355
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:20,199
Hey, Doug, Doug.

356
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:20,967
Look at me.

357
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Look at me.

358
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:23,635
She forgives you.

359
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:24,804
She forgives you!

360
00:28:24,837 --> 00:28:27,373
Doug, you don't need
to do this, please.

361
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:32,211
I love you, dad.

362
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:34,413
I love you.

363
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:41,948
Um... hi?

364
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:48,888
Everything alright?

365
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:51,490
Yeah, I just...

366
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:55,928
wanted to know how much
I owe you for yesterday.

367
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:58,297
Nothing.

368
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,866
Forget about it.

369
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:04,236
I'm having a little get together
tonight at my house

370
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:07,306
in honour of Maggie

371
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:12,011
because I could never give her
a funeral.

372
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:13,880
I could never face it.

373
00:30:17,016 --> 00:30:18,450
Doug, are you inviting me?

374
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:23,389
What, do you want a goldplated
save the date card?

375
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:26,558
Um... I'll be there.

376
00:30:26,592 --> 00:30:27,994
Ok.

377
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:30,863
And I painted over the graffiti

378
00:30:30,897 --> 00:30:33,599
on the side of your house
this morning.

379
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:36,235
You didn't have to do that.

380
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:38,871
Yeah, I did.

381
00:30:38,905 --> 00:30:41,373
'Cause I'm the one
who put it there.

382
00:30:55,687 --> 00:31:00,659
Whoa, Sangria...

383
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,627
Yeah, I am surrounded by friends

384
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,996
'cause they're drinking
the truest drink.

385
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:04,563
Dougie.

386
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,032
No. No.

387
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:06,632
Doug.

388
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:08,600
I'm passing on this one.

389
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:11,237
This is really nice,
she would have liked it.

390
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,472
Yeah, she would have loved it,
honey.

391
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:24,050
She would have loved the party
except for that picture.

392
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:24,650
Exactly.

393
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:26,085
Here's to Maggie.

394
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:27,586
To Mags.

395
00:31:52,678 --> 00:31:54,280
Yo, buddy.

396
00:31:54,313 --> 00:31:56,615
I like the Port more
than Sangria,

397
00:31:56,648 --> 00:32:00,086
I am waiting for that.

398
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:32,684
I am proud to call you dad.

399
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,050
Bastard!

400
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:13,558
Roman.

401
00:33:18,064 --> 00:33:19,064
It's Maggie.

402
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:23,602
Rodney!

403
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:39,251
No! No!

404
00:33:39,285 --> 00:33:41,353
No! No!

405
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:42,088
Noooo!!!!!

406
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:43,322
Let me out!

407
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,656
Let me out!

408
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:50,196
No! No!

409
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:52,431
No!

410
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:53,532
Let me out!

411
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:54,566
Wait, wait wait!

412
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,667
Wait, stop!

413
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:56,744
Maggie, please don't,
please don't, please don't!

414
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:57,736
You gotta let me out!

415
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:58,470
You gotta let me out!

416
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:01,573
Please, please, please, Maggie!

417
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:05,244
Don't! Don't!!

418
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:06,312
You wanted it!

419
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:08,114
You wanted it!

420
00:34:59,231 --> 00:35:00,566
Hi.

421
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,302
Ready for another?

422
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:04,536
I think I've had enough.

423
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:05,604
Come on.

424
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:07,539
This one will make you
feel good.

425
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:10,641
Ok.

426
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:13,579
I got you.

427
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:15,414
I got you.

428
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:31,730
Thank you.

429
00:35:46,512 --> 00:35:48,180
No, you don't.

430
00:35:57,223 --> 00:35:58,223
What?

431
00:35:58,657 --> 00:35:59,325
What?

432
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:01,360
Come on.

433
00:36:01,393 --> 00:36:03,595
Maggie.

434
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:05,597
Maggie?

435
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:07,333
No, Maggie.

436
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:08,166
Maggie, Maggie, Maggie,

437
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:08,967
Maggie, Maggie,
don't, don't, don't.

438
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,636
Don't do this.

439
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,306
Maggie.

440
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:20,479
Maggie.

441
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,780
It's ok.

442
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:25,451
It's ok.

443
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:29,488
No, Maggie, don't do this.

444
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:30,822
Maggie!

445
00:37:12,398 --> 00:37:13,432
Doug.

446
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:19,971
Doug.

447
00:37:25,377 --> 00:37:27,045
Get him outta here.

448
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,078
No!

449
00:37:42,328 --> 00:37:43,629
Jesus.

450
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:46,965
Still scared of me?

451
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,600
Yeah, I thought that
you might have left

452
00:37:48,634 --> 00:37:51,503
after what happened last night.

453
00:37:51,537 --> 00:37:54,573
As soon as I knew what
that creep did I...

454
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,508
could have gone.

455
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,612
I wanted to say bye.

456
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,852
My god.

457
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:09,688
You are totally gonna miss me.

458
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:11,523
Yeah.

459
00:38:11,557 --> 00:38:13,825
I'm not exactly swimming
in friends here.

460
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:15,661
Well, you seem to be turning
that around.

461
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:21,700
So what happens now?

462
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:32,878
Bye, Maggie.

463
00:38:40,386 --> 00:38:43,088
You can't save them.

464
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:44,599
You think if you can
figure out what they want

465
00:38:44,623 --> 00:38:46,057
you can help them.

466
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:49,595
But you can't.

467
00:38:49,628 --> 00:38:51,963
You have to find a different way
to stop this.

468
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,469
Bye, Roman.

469
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,664
You don't understand.

470
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:26,908
I was a different person
back then.

471
00:39:26,932 --> 00:39:27,599
Shut up.

472
00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:31,036
Just... let me explain myself.

473
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:34,540
He said shut up.

474
00:39:34,573 --> 00:39:36,642
You're going to jail, Rodney.

475
00:39:36,675 --> 00:39:39,745
And if you're lucky someone
will remember to feed you.

476
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:44,950
Val, don't do this to me.

477
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:48,754
You owe me due process, right?

478
00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:49,521
I know the law.

479
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:51,723
Look around, you piece of shit.

480
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:53,625
We are the law.

481
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:05,036
You ok, Doug?

482
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,940
Maggie?

483
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:15,046
Yeah, I think she got
what she needed.

484
00:40:19,518 --> 00:40:20,986
I'll see you around.

485
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:36,802
It's ok.

486
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:50,681
Doug.

487
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:55,821
I know I have no right
to ask you this.

488
00:41:02,027 --> 00:41:05,697
You want me to forgive you,
right?

489
00:41:05,731 --> 00:41:06,731
Yes.

490
00:41:10,235 --> 00:41:11,236
Shit!

491
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:20,045
Doug... come on.

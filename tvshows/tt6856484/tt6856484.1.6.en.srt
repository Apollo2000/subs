1
00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:02,703
Previously on Ghost Wars...

2
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:03,671
I need your help.

3
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:05,573
You were given a gift
for a reason, Roman.

4
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:07,075
Now's your chance to use it.

5
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:08,428
You want me to forgive you,
right?

6
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:12,246
Isabel's drawing pictures
of Trevor.

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,181
What's that got to do with me?

8
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:14,854
Because you obviously told
them about him.

9
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:17,081
Marcus? He misses you, too.

10
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:21,322
Trevor no doubt
washed off my boat,

11
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,823
During the storm.
It was the storm.

12
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,758
This town needs you, kid!

13
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:26,127
They don't need me!

14
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,432
This is just great.

15
00:00:35,303 --> 00:00:38,306
*

16
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:09,437
Why do you have every light on?

17
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,205
Do we need these on?

18
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,741
Yes, we do.

19
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:20,181
OK. What's going on?

20
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:24,118
I woke up this morning and
came down to make breakfast

21
00:01:24,152 --> 00:01:26,154
and he was sitting right there.

22
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:28,489
Who?

23
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:29,857
Trevor.

24
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,492
OK.

25
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:33,227
But you know it wasn't Trevor.

26
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:35,563
Yeah, of course.

27
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,831
'Cause they can make you see
what they want you to see.

28
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:38,866
Mmmhmm.

29
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,234
Um...

30
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:44,405
What is that?

31
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,239
It's a taser.

32
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:46,640
Well, yes, I can see
it's a taser.

33
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:47,741
Norm gave it to me.

34
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:50,178
People are saying that
electricity keeps them away.

35
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:51,879
OK, listen to me.

36
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:58,919
I know the last few weeks
have been hard.

37
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,992
But you can't keep trying
to do everything yourself.

38
00:02:01,016 --> 00:02:05,159
You're gonna give yourself
a nervous breakdown.

39
00:02:05,193 --> 00:02:07,928
And if you keep insisting
that you wanna do house calls,

40
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,863
you need to protect yourself

41
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:12,166
because you can't deny that
something's happening here.

42
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,434
I don't deny it,

43
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,902
I- I can diagnose it though,

44
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:17,671
and that's, uh, mass hysteria.

45
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:19,673
Electricity is not the solution.

46
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:20,874
It's a placebo.

47
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:24,545
OK, so take the placebo.

48
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:25,913
For me?

49
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:29,359
OK.

50
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:30,543
Hello?

51
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,219
Thank you.

52
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:33,387
Uh, come on in, Syd.

53
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:35,823
Oh good, you've heard about
the electricity thing.

54
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:37,791
So, uh, I have patients waiting.

55
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,827
I'm gonna go.

56
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,897
There's not much in the fridge
but just make what you can

57
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:45,866
and maybe have an inside
day today?

58
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:46,867
Definitely.

59
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,802
OK, thanks. Bye.

60
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,338
OK girls, we're leaving!

61
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:51,571
We should be back around 4:00.

62
00:02:51,595 --> 00:02:52,873
OK. Bye!

63
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,808
Bye!

64
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,287
You know I'm vegan
but I would kill

65
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,390
for 15 minutes of internet.

66
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,425
What are you lovelies doing?

67
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,928
"Optimists Die First".

68
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:16,997
Ugh, sounds great.

69
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,766
It is.

70
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,602
Is that Marcus Moon?

71
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:22,670
Yeah.

72
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,306
He died and became a ghost.

73
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:27,841
He also told us not
to tell anyone.

74
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,677
It's just Syd.

75
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,314
Yeah. It's just Syd.

76
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:34,948
Sheriff Sam?

77
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:37,318
Yep.

78
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:39,653
And that's Mrs. Foon.

79
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:42,823
Wow, Isabel, you're really
good at details.

80
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,758
Who are you drawing now?

81
00:03:46,437 --> 00:03:47,437
You.

82
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:48,696
Awe.

83
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:05,413
*

84
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:15,889
*

85
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:27,801
Let's take a look. Oooh, yeah.

86
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:29,269
Oh.

87
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,640
OK.

88
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,344
OK.

89
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:39,447
Dottie?

90
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:43,884
Why did you not come and see me
sooner about this?

91
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:49,790
But I like it, dear,
if you come to me.

92
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:50,658
Now, listen.

93
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:54,795
At your age this can get
really infected

94
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,764
and you can lose your arm.

95
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:57,898
I'm 83.

96
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:02,336
I don't need two arms, dear.

97
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,671
How's everything else?

98
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:05,038
Are you sleeping?

99
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:06,106
Are you eating?

100
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:11,879
I sleep when I'm tired
and I eat when I'm hungry.

101
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,515
You have to eat.

102
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,450
I'm making sure I'm eating

103
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:19,353
but I don't have to do anything
that I don't want to.

104
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:21,655
OK, OK.

105
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,289
I'm gonna give you something
to make sure

106
00:05:23,313 --> 00:05:25,025
this doesn't get infected, OK?

107
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,894
OK.

108
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:32,533
I want you to take one of these
three times a day.

109
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,402
OK.

110
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:37,505
You're so good to me.

111
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:39,807
Has anything else
happened lately?

112
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,843
Anything strange?
Out of the ordinary?

113
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:47,715
I had a bowel movement
yesterday.

114
00:05:49,427 --> 00:05:50,427
I don't get it.

115
00:05:50,451 --> 00:05:52,586
Billy, what do you mean
there's no way to leave?

116
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,424
I mean there's no way to leave.

117
00:05:56,457 --> 00:05:57,458
Did you try the inlet?

118
00:05:57,491 --> 00:06:00,394
Of course, and my boat came
all the way back.

119
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:02,062
I mean, for days
I've been in, like,

120
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,565
the fetal position,
thumb in my mouth.

121
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:05,766
Lights on at night time.

122
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,436
Then I would try sailing
under the bridge.

123
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:09,903
Same thing, no exit.

124
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:12,072
Every route, Val, I tried.

125
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,475
I came all the way back
to the docks.

126
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:15,809
So maybe your compass is busted.

127
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:18,479
I swapped them out twice.

128
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:19,813
What about waiting until-

129
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:20,614
Nightfall?

130
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:21,181
Yeah.

131
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:21,949
Navigate by star?

132
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,784
Did it, tried it, didn't work.

133
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:26,787
What if you tried
triangulating your position?

134
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,760
We're stuck. Right here.

135
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:34,094
We are, Val.

136
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,596
There's no way out.

137
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:39,667
You got here.

138
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,735
If there's a way in,
there's gotta be a way out.

139
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,003
Tell that to a Sarlac.

140
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:43,571
A what?

141
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:44,805
Don't worry about it.

142
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,440
What'd I miss?

143
00:06:46,474 --> 00:06:48,576
My brother is dead.

144
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:49,969
Your brother's dead?
Rodney's dead?

145
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,446
I know, Nell,
and I'm very sorry.

146
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,113
I don't need
your fucking sympathy.

147
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,548
What happened?

148
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:56,016
Doug Rennie killed him.

149
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,452
And I wanna know what are
you gonna do about it?

150
00:06:58,486 --> 00:07:00,053
Exactly the same thing
I was gonna do

151
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,489
when we arrested your brother

152
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:02,802
for the murder of Maggie Rennie.

153
00:07:02,826 --> 00:07:03,794
I wasn't gone that long.

154
00:07:03,827 --> 00:07:05,659
We're gonna keep him locked up
pending trial.

155
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:06,426
He's dead?

156
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,660
Where he's living like a king?

157
00:07:07,684 --> 00:07:08,729
Waited on hand and foot?

158
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:09,797
Nell...

159
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,664
I can tell you truthfully,
I've been in that jail,

160
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:12,138
he will not be waited
on like a king.

161
00:07:12,162 --> 00:07:14,167
I demand a trial.

162
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:16,670
Rodney deserves justice.

163
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:17,904
Right, and when we get contact

164
00:07:17,928 --> 00:07:19,807
with the mainland,
you'll get it.

165
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,842
Not fucking good enough!

166
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:22,710
OK, OK.

167
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,945
Alright, I get it,
you're all upset.

168
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,647
You should be.

169
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,883
No offense, but Rodney to me was
like a clean-up on aisle seven.

170
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:31,919
I know he was your brother
and he was your...

171
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,655
Step-uncle-in-law.

172
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,990
Yeah, well, I know you're upset

173
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:39,793
but I'm gonna tell you something
right now, pal.

174
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:41,929
Anybody that looks at
my sister the wrong way,

175
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,664
kinda like you're doing
right now...

176
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,701
Get him out of here
before I get mad.

177
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:48,636
You can't do this.

178
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:49,770
We got rights.

179
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,639
So does Doug Rennie.

180
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,710
Come on. Rodney
deserves justice.

181
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:58,779
Spread the word.

182
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,749
Port Moore's police force
has a new sheriff.

183
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:02,916
What, Norm?

184
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,786
He can't even enforce
a dress code.

185
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,955
Me?

186
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,090
Do I get a badge?

187
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:12,926
Talk about it.

188
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:15,262
OK.

189
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:18,999
Get it, Mr. Bo-Jangles.

190
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,100
Get it.

191
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,069
Now bring it back.

192
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:25,072
Dumb ferret.

193
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,040
He's smarter than you.

194
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:38,619
Cold.

195
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:45,559
Mr. B, what's your problem?

196
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:49,096
Marcus?

197
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,114
Kitty?

198
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:13,320
Kitty?

199
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:18,125
Kitty?

200
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,028
Oh my god!

201
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:27,167
Oh, it's OK.

202
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,069
Oh, my God.

203
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,038
It's OK, sweetie.

204
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,608
You're safe now.

205
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:36,644
How the hell'd you
even get in there?

206
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:42,291
We should go find Syd.

207
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,317
No, I wanna play with Marcus.

208
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:45,719
Abby, stop!

209
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,821
Abby, stop!

210
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:51,725
I'm gonna tell on you!

211
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,095
Abby, come back! Come back!

212
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:58,932
Syd! Syd!

213
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,033
Syd!

214
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,423
Syd?

215
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,858
Girls, I'm home.

216
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,764
Girls?

217
00:10:33,443 --> 00:10:34,443
Syd, are you-

218
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,736
Oh my god!

219
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:36,870
Oh my god, Syd!

220
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:38,872
Oh my god!

221
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:40,941
Oh, my God! No, no, no, no!!!

222
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,409
What the fuck?

223
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,244
She can't hear you.

224
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:44,945
Oh, my God!

225
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,413
Oh my god! Izzy!

226
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:47,247
Are you hurt?

227
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,049
Where's your sister?
Where is she?!

228
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,184
She went outside to play
with Marcus.

229
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:52,152
Marcus?

230
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:53,353
Honey, look at me.

231
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,988
Marcus is dead, remember?

232
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,924
That's not possible, remember?

233
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,992
I remember.

234
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:01,128
He took her to the forest.

235
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:06,934
Thanks for coming out, you guys.

236
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:11,304
Um, so I came home around
4:15 today and I found Syd,

237
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,273
our babysitter.

238
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:14,908
She was...

239
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,947
Abigail was wearing
a Grey sweater, OK?

240
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,850
And someone thought they saw
her head into the forest.

241
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:24,127
Yeah, but... should-
should we really be going

242
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:25,191
into the forest right now?

243
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,887
You wanna go tomorrow morning?!

244
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,455
No one is saying that.

245
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:29,422
OK, so look.

246
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:31,424
We got flashlights,
we might stick together,

247
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,994
we might break up,
we'll see how it feels.

248
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,897
Roman, thanks for coming.

249
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,166
Yeah, well, I'm here
for Abigail.

250
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:42,169
Hey, you're not still mad

251
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,971
about what happened
at the docks, are you?

252
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:46,306
'Cause to me that's just
water under the bridge.

253
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,075
Oh, good.

254
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:49,988
Wow, you're really not gonna
apologize, are you?

255
00:11:50,012 --> 00:11:52,980
No. McGrath's never apologize.

256
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:56,016
Here's Abby over here.

257
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,051
No, I-I haven't seen her.

258
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:04,257
Maybe that's a good thing, yeah?

259
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,259
Yeah, maybe.

260
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:09,797
OK. Let's go.

261
00:12:10,858 --> 00:12:12,018
Hey, hey. Let's go. Let's go.

262
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:13,377
Let's go.

263
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,905
Everywhere. Look everywhere.

264
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,172
Abby!

265
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:20,808
Abigail!

266
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:25,145
I told her not to go.

267
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,147
But she wouldn't listen to me.

268
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,882
Oh, honey.

269
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,885
This is not your fault.

270
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:37,057
I think Marcus wants
to hurt her.

271
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,426
Marcus can't hurt her, honey.

272
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:42,329
He's passed away.

273
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:45,966
That's why he wants
to hurt Abby.

274
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,504
Abby!

275
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:53,073
Abigail!

276
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,375
Hey, you three, spread out.

277
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,377
Wait, wait, wait, we're
so much safer together.

278
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,610
No, we can't search like this.

279
00:12:58,634 --> 00:12:59,813
We'll never find her.

280
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:00,814
Alright, listen up.

281
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:03,450
Roman, I want you to take
front and center.

282
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:04,151
Really?

283
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:05,085
Yeah, I do.

284
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,553
Thanks, buddy.

285
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:07,888
If you guys lose sight of Roman

286
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,090
that means you've spread
out too wide.

287
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,425
Abby!

288
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,327
Abigail!

289
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:16,930
Abby! Honey!

290
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:19,032
Abigail!

291
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,472
So where's Paolo?

292
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:26,840
Up at Lambda.

293
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:28,008
Uh-huh.

294
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,877
Abigail?

295
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,944
Abigail!

296
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:33,881
Wait, I found something!

297
00:13:36,293 --> 00:13:37,293
Oh my god.

298
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,019
It's just a raccoon, Carol.

299
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:41,321
Looks like the rats
from the bar.

300
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,891
It's nothing. It's nothing.
Let's keep going.

301
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:46,960
We should stick together.

302
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:47,995
Val, slow down.

303
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:49,997
It's getting dark, Billy.

304
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,299
Check behind the trees.

305
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,967
Abby!

306
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:56,836
Abby! Where are you?

307
00:14:10,094 --> 00:14:11,094
Run!

308
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:13,954
Everyone get out of
the forest, now!

309
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:16,315
Everyone get out
of the forest now!

310
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:17,157
Run... run!!!

311
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,091
What is he saying?

312
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,193
It sounds like Ron, Ron.

313
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:21,528
Who's Ron?

314
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:24,064
HOLY SHIT!

315
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:12,980
All the way to the parking lot!
Don't stop!

316
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:14,447
Go!

317
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:17,517
Val!

318
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:20,420
Roman, he's choking her!

319
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:22,122
Roman! Get away from her!

320
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:23,523
Coming!

321
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,459
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

322
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:27,727
You OK? Come here.

323
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,430
Up. Come on.

324
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:31,598
We gotta go. We gotta go.

325
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:32,465
We gotta go.

326
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:34,167
Come on.

327
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:36,403
OK, OK, OK, OK.

328
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,637
I think we're good.

329
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:39,973
I think we're good.

330
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,742
They're not chasing us, right?

331
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,713
Wh-why? Why can
you guys see them?

332
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,715
The electricity.

333
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:49,582
The electricity.

334
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,056
There's no electricity
in the forest.

335
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,085
So?

336
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,721
So they're stronger.

337
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:57,257
They-they coulda hurt us a lot
worse if they wanted to.

338
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,361
Oh, so that's them being nice?
Great. Great.

339
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:03,063
We can't go back in there.

340
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:04,998
No.

341
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:06,733
Roman, there's gotta be a way-

342
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:07,434
Look, look, look.

343
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,402
I can't protect everyone, OK?

344
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,116
I can't protect anyone,
not with this dark.

345
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:11,638
Billy?

346
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,740
Val. Val.

347
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:15,013
We'll come back at first light.

348
00:16:15,037 --> 00:16:16,076
We need to stock up.

349
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:18,045
We need to regroup.

350
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,513
You're no good to Abigail dead.

351
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:24,084
Let's go. Let's go.

352
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,703
I know where Abigail is.

353
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,606
Oh my god.

354
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,153
So we go out at first light.

355
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,588
Yeah.

356
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:03,256
But where?

357
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:08,561
Isabel, this drawing is amazing.

358
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:11,831
You're obviously
really talented.

359
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,267
But we don't know where this is.

360
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:16,303
I know.

361
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:20,107
Bunny, you know exactly
where this is?

362
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,408
I've told you.

363
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:24,277
Abigail showed me.

364
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:25,478
We go at first light.

365
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:26,313
Yeah, we go together.

366
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:28,648
Yeah. Yeah.

367
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:31,451
What happens when Abigail
comes home?

368
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:33,253
So stay home.

369
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:40,059
Roman?

370
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,760
All clear.

371
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,497
OK, let's go.

372
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:45,632
OK, honey?

373
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:46,499
Mmmhmm?

374
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:48,468
I want you to stay close
to Roman, OK?

375
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,370
Come on, sweetie.

376
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,471
OK, stay with me.

377
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:52,672
Come on.

378
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:03,550
Be careful.

379
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,485
You stay close with Roman.

380
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,597
We're here.

381
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:52,632
Where?

382
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,334
Through there.

383
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:00,773
Hold my hand.

384
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,788
Holy shit.

385
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,891
Oh shit!

386
00:19:20,537 --> 00:19:21,537
Roman.

387
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:23,563
Over there.

388
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:24,897
Can you see them?

389
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:26,566
Barely.

390
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,403
They don't seem to be
interested in us.

391
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:34,774
Wait. You first.

392
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:17,584
What the shit fuck?

393
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:18,318
Billy.

394
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,387
Sorry, peanut.

395
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,489
I- I don't know, Billy.

396
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:23,990
I don't know.

397
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:28,695
She's in there.

398
00:20:29,573 --> 00:20:30,573
Huh?

399
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:32,157
Yeah, OK, we gotta get her
out of there.

400
00:20:32,181 --> 00:20:32,765
Yeah.

401
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:33,800
OK.

402
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:35,535
OK.

403
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:45,754
Billy, hey!

404
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,880
Billy! Billy!

405
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:48,881
Roman!

406
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,249
Come out.

407
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,620
Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah, Woah.

408
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:55,355
You OK?

409
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,260
Unless you're looking
for a lost weekend

410
00:20:58,284 --> 00:21:00,920
I suggest you do not touch
that thing.

411
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:01,994
OK.

412
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:04,864
You got something for the...

413
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:06,333
Yeah. Gloves.

414
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:06,999
Yeah.

415
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:08,735
Let's try some gloves.

416
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:25,818
OK.

417
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,360
Ready? Yeah?

418
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:34,494
OK, be careful.

419
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:35,527
Oh, god.

420
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:37,730
Ugh.

421
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:39,866
Oh, god.

422
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,802
Ugh.

423
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:44,571
A little more.

424
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:47,906
OK.

425
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:49,676
Right here.

426
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:50,810
I got it.

427
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:52,579
Yeah, I got it.

428
00:21:55,024 --> 00:21:56,024
Hey, hey.

429
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,784
Isabel, you-you OK?

430
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:58,451
Hey, look at me.

431
00:21:58,485 --> 00:21:59,118
You alright?

432
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,953
Woah, Woah, Woah. You OK?

433
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:04,924
We need to get out of here, now!

434
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:05,425
OK, honey.

435
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,459
Billy, I see her.

436
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:07,059
Quickly!

437
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:08,795
I see her.

438
00:22:08,872 --> 00:22:09,872
Billy, I see her.

439
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:10,730
Quicker!

440
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:11,898
She's right there.

441
00:22:11,941 --> 00:22:12,941
Come on.

442
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,401
Come on. Come on.

443
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:15,635
I see her.

444
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,068
Come on.

445
00:22:16,102 --> 00:22:16,936
Oh, god.

446
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:17,637
Come on, baby.

447
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,405
Quickly!

448
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:19,338
Come on, baby.

449
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:20,612
We need to get out of here now.

450
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,808
It's OK, Abby.

451
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,410
It's OK, honey.

452
00:22:23,443 --> 00:22:24,844
Billy...

453
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:25,878
Oh... god.

454
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:27,447
Oh, god.

455
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:45,932
Abby?

456
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:48,601
Can you tell me what happened?

457
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,878
How did you get trapped
in that...

458
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:02,849
in that thing?

459
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:06,553
Honey, you have to tell us
what happened

460
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:08,888
so we know how to help you.

461
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:13,893
Val?

462
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,436
I'll be right back, OK?

463
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:39,819
Has she said anything to you?

464
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:42,689
No. Not a word.

465
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:45,725
It's like I'm not even there.

466
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:49,696
Well, she's in shock.

467
00:23:49,729 --> 00:23:52,532
It's a natural coping mechanism.

468
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:55,067
We'll just give her time.

469
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:03,876
You should have seen that thing

470
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,879
that we pulled her out of, Mar.

471
00:24:06,913 --> 00:24:08,313
I don't know what those
ghost things

472
00:24:08,337 --> 00:24:09,582
were trying to do to her or-

473
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:13,553
Ghosts? You think
ghosts did this?

474
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:15,087
Yes.

475
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,823
Don't you?

476
00:24:20,827 --> 00:24:24,931
I want something...
that makes sense to me.

477
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:28,935
I get it, OK?

478
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,970
But this is happening.

479
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:39,911
Mar...

480
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,858
Well, you're right.

481
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:54,594
We definitely want to see this.

482
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:56,307
It would have been better
to take us to it.

483
00:24:56,331 --> 00:24:58,731
No, it wouldn't have.

484
00:24:58,765 --> 00:25:01,768
He's not wrong.

485
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:03,670
Yeah, you're gonna wanna put
gloves on

486
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:04,823
before you touch that thing.

487
00:25:04,847 --> 00:25:06,072
Why's that?

488
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:08,140
Uh, because when I put
my bare skin to it, it...

489
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:13,012
it made me feel weird.

490
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:14,681
Weird how?

491
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:19,018
Uh, like I made it to third base
with a plant.

492
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,753
Not a baseball fan?

493
00:25:20,787 --> 00:25:21,688
Fair.

494
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:24,090
It-it was a good feeling,
very positive.

495
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:25,024
Euphoric?

496
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:25,892
Yes, that.

497
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:27,126
Ah.

498
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:30,196
It might be secreting some sort
of bufotoxin-like substance

499
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:32,732
as a defense mechanism.

500
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:37,870
Yeah, whatever it is, they were
trying to protect it.

501
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:39,171
Who's "they"?

502
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:41,674
The uh... ghosts.

503
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:42,742
Ah.

504
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:47,113
Wow. That's funny.

505
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:49,816
This is usually the point
where people tell me to shut up.

506
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:52,652
We're all on the same page
around here, Roman.

507
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:56,555
As for the pod, are you sensing
anything paranormal about it?

508
00:25:58,602 --> 00:25:59,602
No.

509
00:25:59,626 --> 00:26:01,694
No? What do you mean, no?

510
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:04,764
If this thing isn't paranormal,
I don't know what is.

511
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:06,065
I don't know about paranormal

512
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:09,802
but it's certainly
crypto botanical.

513
00:26:09,836 --> 00:26:15,374
That's the word for unidentified
or unclassified plants.

514
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,709
What about Abigail?

515
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:18,010
She's not a plant.

516
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:25,317
Are you, uh, are you sensing
anything unusual about her?

517
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:27,754
Uh, Abigail seems fine.

518
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:29,656
Unless you're losing your touch.

519
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:31,369
Oh, because you've done
so well without me.

520
00:26:31,403 --> 00:26:32,483
Made it this far, didn't I?

521
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,927
What, holed up in your boat
drinking whiskey,

522
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:35,662
looking at Playboys?

523
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:36,935
What do you do in there, again?

524
00:26:36,963 --> 00:26:38,230
It's the only way to live.

525
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:39,904
Now I remember why I left you
on the dock.

526
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,937
If you're going to degenerate
to playful banter,

527
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:46,906
take it outside.

528
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,975
I'm trying to actually
work here.

529
00:26:57,684 --> 00:27:00,920
Dottie, this isn't
healing properly.

530
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,822
Have you been cleaning it
the way I showed you?

531
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:05,057
I've done everything
you showed me.

532
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:08,661
OK, well I can't leave you
out here by yourself.

533
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:11,097
Marilyn, I was born
on this land.

534
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,665
What if you fell?

535
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:14,366
Broke a hip? Huh?

536
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,402
It could take days
before someone found you.

537
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:20,306
Abraham says I would be fine.

538
00:27:21,908 --> 00:27:23,876
Abraham has been dead
for seven years, Dottie.

539
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,012
I know that, dear.

540
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:29,682
That's why I was so surprised
to see him.

541
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:33,953
You saw him?

542
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,988
Every night this week.

543
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:39,726
And he keeps asking me
to join him.

544
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:41,293
He's so lonely.

545
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:44,196
He says I can make it painless.

546
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,065
You're not listening to him,
I hope.

547
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:48,300
Oh, sweetie.

548
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:52,104
When did I ever do anything
Abraham wanted me to do, huh?

549
00:27:57,143 --> 00:27:59,812
Do you need anything else?

550
00:27:59,846 --> 00:28:01,013
No.

551
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:05,752
You go home and take care
of that little girl of yours.

552
00:28:05,785 --> 00:28:08,254
Abigail needs your help.

553
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,860
I don't remember mentioning
anything about Abigail.

554
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:16,028
Of course not, dear.

555
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:18,164
Abraham did.

556
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:23,102
You know how gossip spreads
in this town.

557
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:25,972
If you're not careful,

558
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:30,042
you're gonna lose both of
those little angels.

559
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:32,845
And then where will you be?

560
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:34,180
Huh?

561
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:05,978
That's mommy Val's spot.

562
00:29:06,012 --> 00:29:07,046
Mommy Val's spot.

563
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,080
I'm gonna tell on you.

564
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:09,248
Gonna tell on you.

565
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:10,449
Stop it!

566
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:11,884
Stop it!

567
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:12,885
Get off!

568
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:14,253
Get off!

569
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:15,888
Hey! Girls.

570
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:17,256
Izzy, what're you doing?

571
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:20,259
I wish you would go back
to where you came from.

572
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:22,961
Isabel!

573
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:28,868
Are you OK, honey?

574
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:31,403
Come here.

575
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:32,538
It's OK.

576
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:34,306
Shh.

577
00:29:41,157 --> 00:29:42,157
Hey.

578
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:43,549
We don't know what it is.

579
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:44,951
That's why you called me
down here?

580
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:46,819
Yes. Yes.

581
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:50,589
This thing defies all
standard characterization

582
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,091
of flora and fauna.

583
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,592
Regarde.

584
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,195
Showing root-like structures
like a plant

585
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:58,264
but it has a vascular system.

586
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:02,835
It's DNA structure defies
anything I've ever seen before.

587
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:05,972
This is something that has never
been catalogued

588
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:08,841
anywhere on our planet.

589
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:11,010
Tell me about the substance
inside it.

590
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:12,178
Ah.

591
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:15,882
Exploding with nutrients,
lipids, phospholipids, urea,

592
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:21,620
all properties
of amniotic fluid.

593
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:25,157
So Abigail was being gestated?

594
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:36,068
Why would you do that?

595
00:30:36,102 --> 00:30:38,370
Why would you attack
your sister?

596
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:41,173
She was sitting in your seat.

597
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:49,015
That's no reason to get physical
with her and you know it.

598
00:30:50,917 --> 00:30:52,018
Right?

599
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:05,031
Isabel, Abby's had a rough
couple of days.

600
00:31:09,936 --> 00:31:14,941
So I need you to apologize
to your sister

601
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:17,643
so that she knows that
you're on her side.

602
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:22,348
She's not my sister.

603
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:26,652
Why would you say that?

604
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:30,422
Because I'm Abigail.

605
00:31:31,157 --> 00:31:32,491
Stop it.

606
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:35,294
Stop it. You're Isabel.

607
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:37,529
Not today.

608
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:40,066
Today I'm Abigail.

609
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:43,002
Isabel, this isn't funny.

610
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:45,355
I told you she wouldn't
believe us.

611
00:31:45,379 --> 00:31:47,315
I'm not trying to be funny.

612
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,455
I wouldn't have believed it
if I didn't see it for myself.

613
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:55,839
If I didn't hear it for myself,
I wouldn't have believed it.

614
00:31:55,863 --> 00:31:56,949
OK, slow down. Slow down.

615
00:31:56,983 --> 00:31:58,050
Both of them.

616
00:31:58,084 --> 00:32:00,044
I heard both of their voices
coming out of Isabel.

617
00:32:00,077 --> 00:32:01,437
You heard her mimicking
her sister.

618
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,254
At the same time?

619
00:32:02,288 --> 00:32:03,455
Well, that's impossible.

620
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:05,729
So you just heard Abigail
say something at the same time.

621
00:32:05,753 --> 00:32:08,427
No. Abby was in her room, so...

622
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,130
OK.

623
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:14,000
I think they're playing
a prank on you.

624
00:32:15,378 --> 00:32:16,578
I think they're both in there.

625
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:18,304
I think they're in Isabel.

626
00:32:18,337 --> 00:32:19,638
I don't...

627
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:26,012
Don't-what're you doing?

628
00:32:26,045 --> 00:32:28,647
Take these. They'll help.

629
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,016
No.

630
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:35,254
Why is this your solution
to everything, Marilyn?

631
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,188
Huh?

632
00:32:36,222 --> 00:32:38,690
At some point you're gonna
have to accept

633
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:41,193
that there's no
rational explanation.

634
00:32:41,227 --> 00:32:43,462
And then what're you gonna do?

635
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:56,242
Do you want to talk?

636
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:59,645
No. Go back to sleep.

637
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:49,128
Dottie?

638
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,274
Hello?

639
00:34:17,323 --> 00:34:19,057
Dottie?

640
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:30,068
Hello, dear.

641
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:34,106
Is it Wednesday already?

642
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,774
Uh, I was in the neighbourhood.

643
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,876
I thought I would check on you.

644
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,511
Well then stay.

645
00:34:39,545 --> 00:34:41,147
Have a cup of tea with me.

646
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,314
Hmm?

647
00:34:42,348 --> 00:34:43,682
I will.

648
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:51,823
Now, I know you're not here
just to check on me.

649
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:55,394
You were worried about me,
weren't you?

650
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,863
Am I being silly?

651
00:34:57,896 --> 00:35:03,169
It's very kind
and I appreciate it.

652
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:06,238
This looks yummy.

653
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:11,642
Oh...

654
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:18,817
Dottie, I think that's...
gone bad.

655
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,552
Odd.

656
00:35:20,586 --> 00:35:22,888
I just baked it.

657
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:30,896
What's that smell, Dottie?

658
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,400
I don't smell anything.

659
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:45,143
What's that, dear?

660
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,184
I'm sorry.

661
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:05,797
I'm sorry.

662
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:07,933
I'm not.

663
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:11,337
I'm going to kill you
and your entire family.

664
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,930
Don't touch Mr. Bo-Jangles.

665
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:15,667
We're serious!

666
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,242
We said put him down!

667
00:37:32,384 --> 00:37:33,485
What's going on in here?

668
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:36,888
Hey, wait! No, no, no, no, no!

669
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,857
What do you see?

670
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:42,761
I don't-I don't see anything.

671
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:44,363
You're sure, right?

672
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:46,865
This is family.

673
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:49,267
Yeah, I'm sure.

674
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:52,938
What... would you see?

675
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:57,776
Other times, like with Marcus,

676
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:01,880
it-it was like a spirit laying
overtop of the person.

677
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:03,081
But I-I don't see that here.

678
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,916
I don't see anything.

679
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:15,927
So, uh... she's normal?

680
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:25,671
Mmmhmm, yeah. She's normal.

681
00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:28,106
OK. Thank you.

682
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,642
Thanks Roman.

683
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:32,944
Isabel is in her room.

684
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:35,347
One down, one to go.

685
00:38:35,381 --> 00:38:37,082
Thank you.

686
00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:38,884
Roman.

687
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:01,339
Like Marcus?

688
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:10,849
I'm sorry.

689
00:39:20,976 --> 00:39:22,136
Look, maybe-maybe I'm wrong.

690
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,062
Maybe-maybe she's fine.

691
00:39:24,896 --> 00:39:26,565
You're a bad liar.

692
00:39:31,837 --> 00:39:32,971
Problem?

693
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:41,680
I'm not sure yet.

694
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,416
I hate this fucking town.

695
00:39:57,005 --> 00:39:58,005
Mommy M?

696
00:39:58,029 --> 00:39:59,998
Yes, honey?

697
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:02,934
When can I get up?

698
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:04,603
Soon, honey.

699
00:40:19,685 --> 00:40:21,219
Sedate her?

700
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:24,122
That's your plan?

701
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:26,892
Well, you are the one
who told me

702
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:30,996
that she nearly killed
her sister.

703
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:33,031
And she murdered the ferret,

704
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:36,067
so this is enough
to keep her drowsy.

705
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:38,061
There's gotta be something else
we can do for her.

706
00:40:38,095 --> 00:40:38,862
Just leave her.

707
00:40:38,896 --> 00:40:39,896
Leave her.

708
00:40:41,006 --> 00:40:45,944
This is the best I can do
given the circumstances, OK?

709
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:47,779
Well, I'm her mother.

710
00:40:47,813 --> 00:40:48,847
I know what's best.

711
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,215
Yeah, well I'm her mother, too.

712
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:51,983
You know what I mean.

713
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:53,852
Oh my god.

714
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:58,256
Never in a million years did
I think you would pull that.

715
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,925
You want me to believe you?

716
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:00,826
I believe you!

717
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:01,593
I finally believe you.

718
00:41:01,627 --> 00:41:02,961
You don't like my response.

719
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:05,831
What the fuck do
you want from me?

720
00:42:31,149 --> 00:42:34,152

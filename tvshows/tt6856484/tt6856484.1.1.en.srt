1
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:35,436
Death.

2
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:40,441
What is it?

3
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:49,250
I believe that death
is a doorway.

4
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:50,584
A door to a better place

5
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:55,289
where we can see everything
and everyone.

6
00:00:55,323 --> 00:00:58,259
A place where time is lost.

7
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:04,432
And that love,

8
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:08,602
it envelopes us-us all.

9
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:10,871
Marty Hubbard,

10
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:15,276
he didn't believe in God
in the traditional sense.

11
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:22,116
Marty thought that when you died
your energy within you

12
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:27,355
just moves on to other energies
in the universe.

13
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:34,362
That was Marty's version of God.

14
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:37,231
I think it's important
that we embrace

15
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:41,902
the idea that there's more
to life

16
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:45,473
than what you can touch
and what you can see.

17
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,350
It's ok Marty, we got
the message.

18
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,456
It's ok folks, stay calm.

19
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:08,296
It's ok, you've had
a rough week, so...

20
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:13,927
Proverbs 4:24 tells us

21
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:19,933
that there is a duality
to human nature

22
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:26,374
and it's an easy trap
to fall into.

23
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:29,877
So let us not
embrace divisiveness

24
00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:41,289
but be united in truth.

25
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:43,291
I think that's it for today.

26
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:49,563
Let me finish with saying

27
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:55,403
that it's great to see
new faces,

28
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:58,472
and remind you to reach out
to your friends.

29
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:03,277
You tell them that we are
Catholic Plus

30
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:04,812
here at St. Martin's.

31
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,281
Good to see you.

32
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:12,320
Mary, it's always a pleasure.

33
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:13,987
You missed a good one, Val.

34
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:16,324
Yeah. If only I had
the spare time.

35
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:18,292
The election's coming up.

36
00:04:18,326 --> 00:04:21,462
Maybe I should put in a bad word
for you with the voters.

37
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:22,930
You don't have the numbers.

38
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:23,864
Mrs. Foon.

39
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:24,998
Father.

40
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:25,966
Pleasure.

41
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,901
Mayor.

42
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,970
Speaking of which, how goes
the recruitment track?

43
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,005
So long, Mrs. Roth.

44
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,447
It's uphill.

45
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,014
Yeah.

46
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,084
Roman.

47
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,387
I- I just came to say goodbye.

48
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,822
Goodbye.

49
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:49,623
Mayor.

50
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:51,525
Roman.

51
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:55,062
And I wanted to thank you for,

52
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:59,467
all the help that you've
given me over these years.

53
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,369
You know I'm not
the church type.

54
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:04,972
Well, that's what neighbours are
supposed to do for one another.

55
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:11,078
I wanna give you my best for
the next chapter of your life.

56
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:14,948
Roman, I mean that.

57
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,484
See ya.

58
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,490
I can't say I'm gonna be sorry
to see him go.

59
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,061
What?

60
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:36,069
He who gives to the poor
shall never want.

61
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:43,611
He who shuts his eyes, well...
brings many sorrows.

62
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,666
Freak!

63
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:16,109
Thanks, Doug.

64
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:36,564
So you're finally making good
on that threat to leave town?

65
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,840
I don't blame you.

66
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:50,077
You've put up with more
than most could.

67
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,947
For longer than most would.

68
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:56,917
The fact is people are assholes.

69
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,120
When they encounter something...
different

70
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,155
it scares them.

71
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:03,199
I don't wanna be different.

72
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,493
I just-I'm just...

73
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:06,527
Unique?

74
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:10,163
Yeah, sure.

75
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:17,938
I just-I wanna go to a town
that's big enough that,

76
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:21,575
I can be anonymous and no one
gives a shit, you know?

77
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:25,212
Where unique is boring.

78
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:27,881
I am gonna miss you.

79
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:33,086
Thanks.

80
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,624
Aren't you gonna miss me?

81
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:38,225
A little bit I think.

82
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,237
See ya later.

83
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:00,213
Roman, you can't leave.

84
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:03,083
Who the hell am I gonna
hang out with?

85
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:06,186
You're literally the only person
I can talk to.

86
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,221
Why do you think I'm leaving?

87
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,695
Mrs. Foon.

88
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,129
Hey.

89
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:22,102
I'm actually jealous.

90
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:26,039
I'd give my right arm
to leave this shit hole.

91
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:29,176
So why don't you?

92
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,044
You know why.

93
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,916
You really wanna be alone?

94
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,590
Well, I guess this is
my stop then.

95
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:45,225
Maggie-

96
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:49,196
Maggie, come on.

97
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,101
Mrs. Foon.

98
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:57,605
You you going to Anchorage
to do some shopping?

99
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,146
Roman! Wake up!

100
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:42,082
Roman!

101
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:43,984
You have to get out of here now!

102
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,118
Go!

103
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:56,429
Mrs. Foon!

104
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:57,230
Give me your hand!

105
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,264
Give me your hand!

106
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,337
So cell towers and landlines
out of town are down.

107
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,415
The phones work locally but
there's no way to call out.

108
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,810
We need to check the bridge
for earthquake damage.

109
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:51,318
I know every person
inside those body bags.

110
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,791
Can you walk me through
what happened?

111
00:10:57,825 --> 00:10:59,359
Yeah, yeah.

112
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,227
We were-we were driving

113
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:05,232
and um... and the bus,
it lost control,

114
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:08,101
it swerved, and it-
and it crashed

115
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:09,278
and I was-I was in the back.

116
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:10,170
I was-

117
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,414
You were the nearest
to the rear door?

118
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:12,339
Yeah.

119
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:13,273
In the back seat, and-

120
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:14,306
Roman.

121
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,120
I wanna know what happened
in there.

122
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:18,321
I just-I just wanna know
what happened.

123
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,279
Larry, go.

124
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:20,380
It's my mother in there!

125
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:21,424
Alright, get him out of here.

126
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:23,717
Get out of here!

127
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:25,285
Not her.

128
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:34,127
I'm really sorry for how you get
treated around here, Roman.

129
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,298
I'm ashamed of it, actually.

130
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,869
I tried to save Mrs. Foon.

131
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:46,073
It's okay.

132
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,344
Can I get you a ride home?

133
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,046
No, I can't go home.

134
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,816
I- I was supposed to be on
that bus out of here forever.

135
00:11:55,849 --> 00:12:00,320
I... I let my apartment go,
my bag was...

136
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,792
What about your mom's place?

137
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,393
I know it's not ideal,

138
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:09,396
but it'll do the trick until
the next bus comes through.

139
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,799
Yeah. Thank-thank you.

140
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:53,233
Boo.

141
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,368
Jesus, Maggie, you scared
the crap out of me.

142
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:57,404
It comes with the territory.

143
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,875
What the hell is going on
out there?

144
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:05,354
Did you-did you feel
that earthquake?

145
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,447
That was no earthquake.

146
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,515
What?

147
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:09,016
No, what do you mean,
"that was no earthquake"?

148
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:11,384
Then what was it?

149
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:15,422
Looks like I get to keep you
around a little longer.

150
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,525
Yeah, looks like it.

151
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,430
I like this place.

152
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,432
It has good energy.

153
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,354
Where are you going?

154
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,322
I need to check on my dad.

155
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:20,420
Hello?

156
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,392
The bar is closed!

157
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:35,102
You don't have to go home
but you can't stay... here.

158
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:07,667
Jesus Christ, Roman!

159
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,469
You scared the shit out of me!

160
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,538
I'm so sorry.

161
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,373
What're you doing here?

162
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,275
Do you guys have anything
to eat?

163
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,344
I'm staying at my mom's place

164
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:21,481
and-and all she has is expired
soup and expired green beans.

165
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:22,482
I can-I can pay.

166
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:23,150
No, no, no.

167
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:26,453
I can wrangle you something.

168
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,387
Thank you.

169
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,456
I heard about the bus.

170
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:32,192
Jesus.

171
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:33,226
You ok?

172
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:36,429
Yeah.

173
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:38,665
I was, I was lucky.

174
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,467
No shit.

175
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:49,309
So... you're staying
at your mom's?

176
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,378
Is she ever coming back?

177
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,713
Who knows with her?

178
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,615
She's a free spirit.

179
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,385
You guys don't talk at all?

180
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:01,488
She sends Father Dan letters
every once in a while

181
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:06,226
with some cash or...

182
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,495
you know, honestly I-I just
don't give a shit.

183
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:19,439
Ok, well I'm gonna see if I can
find you some real food.

184
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:21,241
Thank you.

185
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:46,533
I want every rivet and bolt
checked, boys.

186
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:53,573
How's it going up there, Marty?

187
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:56,443
Looks good up here, boss.

188
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:59,512
There's no cracks, no stress
on the joints.

189
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:02,715
Alright. Let's get off
of this heap of shit.

190
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,152
You don't have to ask me twice.

191
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:10,690
Alright, boys, I'm pulling
the plug on this.

192
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:38,618
What do you want?

193
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:49,196
Hey, Norm.

194
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:51,498
Here to turn yourself in?

195
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:52,465
No.

196
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:54,634
I- I was um, I was wondering
if Sam was in?

197
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:55,735
The sheriff?

198
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,770
Yeah, thanks for
clarifying that.

199
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,374
Is he in or not, Norm?

200
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:03,376
Yes, yes, one second.

201
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:13,353
Yeah, hey, it's Norm
down at the station.

202
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:16,623
Yeah, I'd like to order one pepperoni
and one Hawaiian for delivery-

203
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:17,290
Sam!

204
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:18,725
Roman, get back here!

205
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,360
Sam!

206
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:21,361
Can I talk to you in private?

207
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:22,462
Can it wait?

208
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,464
I'm up to my ass in shit.

209
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,266
Just two minutes, please.

210
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:27,400
Come on.

211
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:31,738
Ok, come on in.

212
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:33,573
Have a seat.

213
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:37,377
You have my undivided attention.

214
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:39,612
Um, I-I-look,

215
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:42,482
I know that people think that
I'm crazy, right,

216
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,350
touched in the head.

217
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:44,384
I don't.

218
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,388
Something happened on that bus.

219
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:49,656
Right. No shit?

220
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,492
No, something I didn't tell you.

221
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:58,498
Something that I can't
quite explain.

222
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:04,271
When I went to try and save
Mrs. Foon there were...

223
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:06,473
these forces.

224
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:07,374
Forces?

225
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:10,410
Working against me.

226
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:12,412
And... the people who died,

227
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:17,216
when they died they came-
they came back.

228
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:22,489
They-they came back?

229
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:23,423
Yeah.

230
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:24,090
I'm just telling you what I saw.

231
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:25,558
You're talking about ghosts?

232
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:30,762
Roman?

233
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:36,503
Um, I think you've been
through a lot.

234
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:38,571
You know, it can be,
um, traumatic.

235
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:39,406
No.

236
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:41,274
I think you're experiencing
shock.

237
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:42,385
I'm not experiencing shock,
I'm telling you-

238
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:43,343
We all are.

239
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:44,043
It's not just you it's-

240
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,478
What I saw-

241
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:46,979
Something's going down
at the bridge.

242
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:48,014
I gotta go.

243
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:51,451
Listen, I know you've seen
something horrible.

244
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:55,422
I- I need you not to talk
about ghosts, ok?

245
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:56,689
Ok.

246
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:59,426
People are already upset enough,
ok?

247
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:02,429
Can I count on you for that?

248
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:03,062
Yeah, of course.

249
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,397
You can count on me, Sam.

250
00:21:57,617 --> 00:22:00,587
This is definitely your colour.

251
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,392
Marcus, honey, can you pass me
the blush?

252
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,400
Thank you.

253
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,609
Port Moore Police, please hold.

254
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:25,144
Port Moore Police, please hold.

255
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,079
Port Moore Police, please hold.

256
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:28,448
Police, what's your emergency?

257
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:30,349
Hey, I need your help up here!

258
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:32,585
Hello?

259
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:34,587
Hello?

260
00:22:36,456 --> 00:22:38,391
All the systems just went down.

261
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:07,720
We've never had death like this.

262
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:13,426
It can change a town forever.

263
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:20,800
It gets etched into
our collective memory

264
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,201
and it can define us.

265
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,972
Tell us who we are.

266
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:30,543
I know this is where
I'm supposed to comfort you

267
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:34,581
and tell you that it's
all part of God's plan.

268
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:43,556
Well, this is not a sales pitch
and I'm not some stranger.

269
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:47,794
I'm a neighbour
and a friend first.

270
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:52,465
Speaking as someone
who grew up in this town,

271
00:23:57,637 --> 00:24:02,241
I can only say is... holy shit.

272
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,476
Holy shit.

273
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,746
Holy shit!

274
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,716
Unholy shit.

275
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:12,485
You mean, father.

276
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:14,086
What's that, Doug?

277
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:17,624
Unholy.

278
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:22,529
Everybody in this room is
talking about how that freak

279
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:25,264
was the only person
to survive that crash.

280
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,199
Ok, Doug. Calm yourself.

281
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:29,268
He's always lurking
in the fringes,

282
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,270
dressing like a ghoul.

283
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,574
He doesn't fit in.

284
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:38,244
He doesn't belong.

285
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:39,411
That's ridiculous.

286
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:41,714
You have no evidence that
this boy has done anything.

287
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:44,116
What about his mother
and what she did to-

288
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:44,984
Enough!

289
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:46,228
His mother put a curse
on this town!

290
00:24:46,252 --> 00:24:47,554
Alright, stop it!

291
00:24:47,587 --> 00:24:51,524
Her and her psychic bullshit!

292
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:53,059
Stop it!

293
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:54,226
This instant!

294
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,194
That's enough!

295
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:56,763
NO!

296
00:24:56,796 --> 00:24:58,064
You will not blame this boy!

297
00:24:58,097 --> 00:24:59,799
He has done nothing!

298
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,534
Nothing!

299
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:03,235
This is fear talking!

300
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:07,006
You're looking for blame!

301
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,075
Well, I'm not gonna
let you blame this boy!

302
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:10,788
I'm not gonna allow it
in the house of God!

303
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:33,265
What?!

304
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:52,284
It's...

305
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:54,787
it's not good out there, Maggie.

306
00:25:54,821 --> 00:25:58,324
They're blaming me
for what's going on.

307
00:25:58,357 --> 00:26:00,259
If they only knew.

308
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,294
What does that mean?

309
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:04,697
You're special.

310
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:06,065
Your gift.

311
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:09,335
You're the only one
who can see them.

312
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,106
You really don't get what it's
like for me, do you, Maggie?

313
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,209
My gift?

314
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:21,013
When I was six years old
I had this friend.

315
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:22,715
His name was Thomas

316
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:27,654
and, we did everything
together, you know?

317
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:30,222
Just regular best friends.

318
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:36,095
Except Thomas had died
a year earlier.

319
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:40,132
Car accident.

320
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,200
But he was my friend.

321
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:43,102
He was real to me.

322
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,010
Then these kids, these
these kids, they-

323
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:53,245
they jumped all over that.

324
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,182
They um, used it to push me away

325
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:58,350
and call me names and it stuck.

326
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:00,119
Those names stuck.

327
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:02,221
It worked.

328
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:09,328
Because this whole town
will never forget it.

329
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,330
So when you say I have this gift

330
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:14,133
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about,

331
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:20,306
'cause nothing good has
ever come from this gift.

332
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:27,113
I'm sorry.

333
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,214
I didn't mean to-

334
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:29,782
It's ok.

335
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:40,292
So these ghosts, right?

336
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:43,262
They're trapped here,
so what do they want?

337
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:46,365
They're not like me.

338
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:54,398
If a soul wants to move on
but... but finds itself trapped,

339
00:27:55,842 --> 00:28:01,247
that soul will lash out
at the living.

340
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:06,318
They'll come at you
and I can't protect you.

341
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:13,826
Next thing I know, the little
creep's barging into the station

342
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:19,365
blathering on about spirits
this and undead that.

343
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:20,838
Sounds like somebody's
trying to walk

344
00:28:20,867 --> 00:28:22,835
in his mother's shoes.

345
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:25,071
For all we know the little
bastard caused the accident

346
00:28:25,104 --> 00:28:26,739
to drum up business for himself.

347
00:28:26,773 --> 00:28:28,074
Hey, whatever you mouthbreathers

348
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:31,844
are thinking of doing,
don't do it.

349
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:33,345
We're only talking.

350
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:34,847
Just a bunch of guys talking.

351
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:36,282
Mmmhmm.

352
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:41,053
See you guys later.

353
00:28:41,087 --> 00:28:42,454
Thanks for the tip, Larry.

354
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:46,325
Hey.

355
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:47,426
I'm serious, Doug.

356
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,295
Leave that kid alone.

357
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:55,034
You, you leaving town?

358
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,468
As soon as they open the bridge.

359
00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:58,204
I wanna be the first out.

360
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:01,307
That bad?

361
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,277
I have been around death almost
my whole life, Roman.

362
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:07,046
Something's wrong here.

363
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,382
I don't know what but I don't
wanna find out.

364
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:12,384
Marcus, let's go back inside.

365
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:14,854
I wouldn't stick around too long
if I were you, Roman.

366
00:29:18,825 --> 00:29:21,393
I don't care what
that priest says.

367
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:22,128
We're not gonna sit around here

368
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:26,065
and let you take this town down.

369
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,300
What're you gonna do, Doug?

370
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:32,071
Something we should have done
a long time ago.

371
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:45,384
You got two choices.

372
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:48,087
You leave town right now

373
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,222
or we'll do things
the old fashioned way.

374
00:29:50,256 --> 00:29:51,366
Doug, I'm trying to leave town.

375
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,392
That's what I'm trying to do.

376
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:55,327
Try harder.

377
00:29:55,361 --> 00:29:58,530
Don't test me, Doug Rennie.

378
00:29:58,564 --> 00:30:00,099
Take him in, Norm.

379
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,209
Do you want me to cuff him, or-

380
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:02,168
No, don't cuff him, Norm.

381
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:03,302
Just take him in.

382
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:04,370
Come on, Doug.

383
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:10,843
We were just trying
to scare the kid.

384
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:12,144
Ok.

385
00:30:16,382 --> 00:30:17,249
Take him in.

386
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:18,517
Read him his rights.

387
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,321
Anybody lays a finger
on Roman Mercer

388
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:24,523
gets a free vacation
in my jailhouse.

389
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,358
Am I clear?

390
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,198
Jesus Christ.

391
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:34,266
Rodney, a hanging rope?

392
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,601
Really?

393
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:37,403
Give me the rope.

394
00:30:38,104 --> 00:30:39,205
Give me the rope.

395
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:41,340
Do you wanna join your friend?

396
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:42,374
Rodney?

397
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:44,143
Say the words.

398
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:47,513
I don't wanna join my friend.

399
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:49,648
Ok. Then quit encouraging him.

400
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,383
Now go on home.

401
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:53,452
All of you. Go home.

402
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,425
Thank you.

403
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,393
You ok?

404
00:31:01,427 --> 00:31:02,394
Yeah.

405
00:31:02,428 --> 00:31:06,398
I mean... can you,
can you give me a ride?

406
00:31:06,432 --> 00:31:08,267
Yeah. I gotta do
something first.

407
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,301
Come on.

408
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:12,304
Hi.

409
00:31:12,338 --> 00:31:13,339
Hey.

410
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:14,473
Hey.

411
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:16,275
Good afternoon.

412
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:24,383
I'm sorry, Roman.

413
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,417
That's ok.

414
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:28,320
You were just protecting Marcus.

415
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:31,223
Norm said you had something
to show me.

416
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:32,467
Yeah, we have to send this one
to Anchorage

417
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:34,660
for an autopsy.

418
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:37,296
No obvious signs of trauma.

419
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:38,931
Pull down the sheet.

420
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:47,106
Heart attack.

421
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:48,474
Ruptured.

422
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:49,641
His heart exploded.

423
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,279
How?

424
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,415
Something terrified him.

425
00:31:58,617 --> 00:31:59,851
Scared him to death.

426
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:02,588
Well, that doesn't make a lot
of sense, medically speaking.

427
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:04,156
Yeah.

428
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,358
The problem is there's a lot of
that going around.

429
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:07,593
Like the bus.

430
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:09,461
I tried to tell you.

431
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:12,098
I know.

432
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:15,467
I'm willing to listen now.

433
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:20,472
This earthquake, I don't think
it was a normal tremor.

434
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,210
For the dead I think
it was worse.

435
00:32:24,243 --> 00:32:26,445
It was much, much worse.

436
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:28,180
It was worse for the dead?

437
00:32:28,214 --> 00:32:30,216
What does that even mean?

438
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:31,550
I don't know.

439
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:37,223
I think that everyone who's died
since the earthquake, they-

440
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:40,226
they can't move on.

441
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:41,093
To the afterlife?

442
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:46,232
Like I said, I don't-
I don't know.

443
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:50,536
But they're stuck here.

444
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:54,640
And they're angry,
and they blame us.

445
00:33:00,379 --> 00:33:03,482
Sofia, I think it's best if you
got Marcus out of here.

446
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:05,184
Because there's a ghost?

447
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:05,784
Yes, now, please.

448
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:06,418
Cool.

449
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:07,452
Thank you.

450
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:27,406
It's locked.

451
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:30,409
Like the bus.

452
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:32,544
Yeah, like the bus.

453
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:37,483
Yeah, I don't know if that's
gonna do anything, but sure.

454
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:42,554
What happens now?

455
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:44,323
I couldn't tell you.

456
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:54,333
It knows I can see it.

457
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,402
It doesn't like that.

458
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:01,139
Am I not-I don't know-

459
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:05,344
Sir... get down, sir!

460
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:07,278
Down!

461
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:13,584
Sam!

462
00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:20,359
Look at me, Sam!

463
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,230
Stop!

464
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:27,099
Stop-you gotta stop it, man!

465
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:28,434
You gotta look at me!

466
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:29,235
Sam!

467
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:30,369
Sam! It's in your head!

468
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:33,348
Whatever it is,
it's in your head!

469
00:34:33,372 --> 00:34:34,373
Sam!

470
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,311
No! No!

471
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:41,747
No!

472
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:44,149
Stop!

473
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,358
No! No!

474
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:56,362
No, no!

475
00:34:56,395 --> 00:34:57,196
No, stop!

476
00:34:57,229 --> 00:34:57,729
Jesus.

477
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:00,166
It's ok, it's ok.

478
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,567
We're gonna get you
some help, ok?

479
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,601
I won't leave you.

480
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,479
Sam...

481
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:32,656
I think it's important
that we embrace the idea

482
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:38,337
that there's more to life than
what you can touch or see.

483
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:27,219
You saw it?

484
00:36:27,253 --> 00:36:30,256
I saw things, yes.

485
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:32,358
What happened?

486
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:34,626
Sam.

487
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,396
Sheriff Sam, he's-he's dead.

488
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:00,619
Marty!

489
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:01,520
Go! Go!

490
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:02,254
Get out!

491
00:37:02,288 --> 00:37:03,322
Come on!

492
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:05,291
Go! Go!

493
00:37:05,324 --> 00:37:06,425
Go! Go!

494
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:16,435
Marty?

495
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:20,272
You need to leave this place.

496
00:37:20,306 --> 00:37:22,541
You have to go now!

497
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,944
Go.

498
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:27,679
Leave.

499
00:37:59,645 --> 00:38:00,946
What do we do?

500
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:01,647
Ok?

501
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,081
'Cause I don't know what to do.

502
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,451
We evacuate the town.

503
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:07,686
Get people to safety.

504
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:08,719
Evacuate?

505
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:12,358
Because of a few deaths
and a bar fight, no way.

506
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:14,760
That was no bar fight.

507
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,495
Then what was it?

508
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:20,399
Ghosts.

509
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:23,935
Ghosts.

510
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:26,772
I- I know what it sounds
like but...

511
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,974
It's evidence of the afterlife.

512
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:32,411
Evidence of another realm.

513
00:38:32,444 --> 00:38:33,612
We may need to save

514
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:36,482
the philosophical and religious
implications conversation

515
00:38:36,515 --> 00:38:37,716
for another day.

516
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:41,052
The mayor's right.

517
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:43,589
We need to figure out
what they want.

518
00:38:43,622 --> 00:38:46,725
That's not what I'm saying
at all.

519
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:50,396
Roman, do you know
what they want?

520
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:52,398
Between the bridge, the bus,
and the bar,

521
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:54,366
I think it's pretty obvious
what they want.

522
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,467
So that's it?

523
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:57,636
You guys are just gonna believe
his ghost theories?

524
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:00,439
Faith, Val.

525
00:39:00,472 --> 00:39:05,043
Faith is evidence
of unseen things.

526
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:08,547
This all seems a little woowoo.

527
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,383
Even for someone in
the business of religion.

528
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:16,522
The bible's got serpents,
angels, spirits.

529
00:39:16,555 --> 00:39:18,990
It is a little woowoo.

530
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:21,493
These are things that we're
not supposed to comprehend

531
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:23,695
yet we accept it.

532
00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:27,399
Well, I need hard evidence
before I accept it.

533
00:39:27,433 --> 00:39:31,537
Before we go running off
halfcocked.

534
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,614
Well, what I've seen
with my own eyes

535
00:39:32,638 --> 00:39:34,440
is evidence enough for me.

536
00:39:34,473 --> 00:39:35,774
Me too. I've seen enough.

537
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:38,410
We need to notify the National
Guard, the Army.

538
00:39:38,444 --> 00:39:39,521
We need to get the hell
outta here.

539
00:39:39,545 --> 00:39:40,979
No, we need to all calm down.

540
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:42,714
I'm not ordering an evacuation

541
00:39:42,748 --> 00:39:44,659
just because you guys decide
to believe in ghosts.

542
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:45,517
Val, please.

543
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:48,153
Anyone who wants to leave
can leave.

544
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:51,156
But keep your mouth shut
about this ghost nonsense.

545
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,676
We need to tell
the world outside this town

546
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:12,043
what's going on.

547
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,082
I want to come with you.

548
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:28,093
Look, I'm sorry about the way
we treated you, Roman.

549
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:30,696
Until this happened I didn't
know what to believe.

550
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:34,533
What do you believe now?

551
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:36,535
I believe in ghosts.

552
00:40:38,236 --> 00:40:40,472
And I believe in you.

553
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:51,682
Stop the car!

554
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,184
The bridge-the bridge is out!

555
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:54,562
What're you talking about?
It looks fine.

556
00:40:54,586 --> 00:40:55,554
Larry! Larry, please.

557
00:40:55,587 --> 00:40:56,387
Larry! Stop the-

558
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:58,089
I'm looking-I'm looking
right at it!

559
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:01,126
Jesus!

560
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,193
Stop! Stop! Stop!

561
00:41:02,227 --> 00:41:03,228
Stop!

562
00:41:05,764 --> 00:41:07,065
Holy shit!

563
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:15,574
What happened to Larry?

564
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:16,642
He went over the edge.

565
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:17,715
What're you talking about?

566
00:41:17,743 --> 00:41:18,877
They-they did it.

567
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:22,047
They-they're making it seem
normal but it's-it's not.

568
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,249
It-they can put things
in your mind.

569
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:26,051
You can't-you can't trust
what you see.

570
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:27,519
I don't understand.

571
00:41:27,553 --> 00:41:29,254
The section-
that section's gone.

572
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:30,722
It's missing.

573
00:41:30,756 --> 00:41:33,291
An illusion.

574
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,728
The bridge is out.

575
00:41:36,762 --> 00:41:37,762
We're trapped.

576
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,168
You know, we're lucky
to have you here.

577
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:45,003
And your gift.

578
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:47,606
We'd all be dead, otherwise.

579
00:41:49,808 --> 00:41:51,276
So what do we do now?

580
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:55,747
Figure out a way to fight it.

581
00:41:57,583 --> 00:41:58,584
Shit!

582
00:41:59,585 --> 00:42:01,787
Stop! Stop!

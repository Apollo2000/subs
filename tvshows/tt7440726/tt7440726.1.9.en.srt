1
00:00:00,382 --> 00:00:03,427
Previously on Your Honor...

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,970
I am 100% emotionally involved

3
00:00:05,053 --> 00:00:08,098
in getting this brute
of a human being

4
00:00:08,181 --> 00:00:09,558
convicted of this murder.

5
00:00:09,641 --> 00:00:11,435
She's tearing him apart
in there,

6
00:00:11,518 --> 00:00:13,145
and you're letting it
fucking happen.

7
00:00:13,228 --> 00:00:16,565
I'm watching my son
heading for death row!

8
00:00:16,606 --> 00:00:18,734
Counselor, we don't need
to go here.

9
00:00:18,775 --> 00:00:22,404
I think the jury has seen
all that they need to see.

10
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:24,740
See you at school.

11
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:26,158
Wait...

12
00:00:26,241 --> 00:00:30,203
- So who is this guy?
- He's great.

13
00:00:30,287 --> 00:00:31,621
Adam.

14
00:00:31,705 --> 00:00:34,082
Adam... That's it?

15
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:37,669
I don't know that much
about him.

16
00:00:41,548 --> 00:00:42,883
I've never seen these.

17
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:44,092
They were in Mom's Leica.

18
00:00:44,176 --> 00:00:46,219
It's her last photographs.

19
00:00:46,303 --> 00:00:47,721
These are all
Desire gang members.

20
00:00:47,763 --> 00:00:50,223
We-we know all of them
but this one.

21
00:00:51,725 --> 00:00:55,395
I think she was in trouble,
and she knew it.

22
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:56,897
Let me find this man.

23
00:00:56,938 --> 00:00:58,273
What's up, prison shit?

24
00:00:58,315 --> 00:01:01,359
I got to have at that fuck
that killed Rocco.

25
00:01:01,401 --> 00:01:03,278
How's his heart?

26
00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:05,197
Stopped. And his head?

27
00:01:05,238 --> 00:01:07,908
Cracked open like
a fuckin' watermelon.

28
00:01:09,743 --> 00:01:11,328
Carlo Baxter,
you're under arrest.

29
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:12,651
- For what?
- You have the right

30
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,247
- to remain silent.
- For what?!

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

32
00:02:21,606 --> 00:02:23,275
He's upstairs!

33
00:02:33,076 --> 00:02:35,287
Oh, damn!

34
00:02:56,474 --> 00:02:57,893
Hey there!

35
00:03:16,578 --> 00:03:17,829
I need immunity.

36
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:20,248
Well, that's not how this works.
You need to convince me

37
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:22,042
immunity is something
you deserve,

38
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,418
and I'll see what I can do.

39
00:03:27,464 --> 00:03:30,342
I-I really don't
have time for this.

40
00:03:30,383 --> 00:03:32,177
I can't fucking run anymore!

41
00:03:35,764 --> 00:03:38,558
I've been hiding out
three months.

42
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:42,020
I'm out of money,

43
00:03:42,062 --> 00:03:44,689
out of drugs...

44
00:03:44,731 --> 00:03:47,609
and this morning they found me.

45
00:03:48,526 --> 00:03:51,863
Who are you running from?

46
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:55,533
You know who I'm running from.

47
00:03:55,575 --> 00:03:57,786
We need to hear you say it.

48
00:04:00,747 --> 00:04:02,916
Give me the words, Joey.

49
00:04:08,838 --> 00:04:11,758
Jimmy Baxter.

50
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,511
Carlo gets arrested for murder,

51
00:04:14,552 --> 00:04:17,097
and Jimmy comes after you. Why?

52
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,308
There may have been...

53
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,645
some fentanyl. Okay?

54
00:04:23,687 --> 00:04:27,023
A side deal behind Jimmy's back.

55
00:04:27,107 --> 00:04:29,276
Hence the one-fifty on Carlo.

56
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:31,152
This isn't a trial about drugs.

57
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:34,072
This is a murder trial
that resumes in 15 minutes,

58
00:04:34,155 --> 00:04:35,657
so if you have something
to say to me,

59
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:38,118
I need to hear it
right this second.

60
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:40,245
Carlo bragged about
killing Kofi.

61
00:04:40,328 --> 00:04:42,789
He told me that the kid
came to his cell,

62
00:04:42,831 --> 00:04:45,458
and he split his head open
like a watermelon.

63
00:04:46,835 --> 00:04:50,171
His words?
The watermelon?

64
00:04:50,213 --> 00:04:52,799
- His words.
- What else?

65
00:04:55,427 --> 00:04:56,469
Gina.

66
00:04:56,553 --> 00:04:58,638
- Carlo's mom.
- What about her?

67
00:04:58,722 --> 00:05:02,225
She made sure Carlo got
to OPP that night.

68
00:05:02,309 --> 00:05:03,893
She used me to help with that.

69
00:05:03,977 --> 00:05:06,646
Gina Baxter pulled the strings
on the whole thing.

70
00:05:11,776 --> 00:05:16,281
Look. I know a lot more
than just this trial.

71
00:05:16,323 --> 00:05:19,993
So give me a good fucking deal
'cause this is just the start.

72
00:05:29,836 --> 00:05:31,063
You want me
to have him cleaned up?

73
00:05:31,087 --> 00:05:34,549
No. Leave him exactly
as he is.

74
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,633
He's the real deal.

75
00:05:35,675 --> 00:05:38,178
I want the jury to smell
the fear coming off him.

76
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:45,477
What's his name?

77
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,853
Joey Maldini.

78
00:05:46,895 --> 00:05:49,272
This is outrageous, Your Honor.
Outrageous.

79
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:50,541
This witness is not on the list.

80
00:05:50,565 --> 00:05:52,525
There's no mention of him
in discovery, nothing.

81
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:54,569
He just walked into
a police station two hours ago.

82
00:05:54,652 --> 00:05:57,489
I am sorry if this is
less than ideal for the defense.

83
00:05:57,572 --> 00:05:58,732
Yeah, less than ideal for us.

84
00:05:58,782 --> 00:06:00,176
You're damn right it's
less than ideal for us.

85
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,202
But it is ideal for them.
This surprise witness

86
00:06:02,285 --> 00:06:04,496
just-just shows up
out of nowhere,

87
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:06,179
ambushing us with
game-changing evidence.

88
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:07,350
Are you suggesting that
I knew about this witness

89
00:06:07,374 --> 00:06:09,374
- and held onto him?
- Yes.

90
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,043
That I would risk
my entire career

91
00:06:10,126 --> 00:06:11,645
- just to jump you with this?
- Oh, give me... Fuck.

92
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:13,546
Did I push him out
a second-story window?

93
00:06:13,588 --> 00:06:16,007
- Did I break his ankle for him?
- Ms. McKee, please!

94
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:18,510
Fine, I'll give him
the benefit of the doubt.

95
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:20,053
He's making wild accusations

96
00:06:20,095 --> 00:06:21,405
because he knows
this witness kills him.

97
00:06:21,429 --> 00:06:23,598
That's why you need
to let Joey testify.

98
00:06:23,681 --> 00:06:26,101
Listen, I want both of you
to go back to your corners,

99
00:06:26,142 --> 00:06:28,103
take a couple minutes
and calm down.

100
00:06:28,186 --> 00:06:32,065
And then I want to know exactly
what Maldini is going to say.

101
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:39,406
Ms. McKee.

102
00:06:39,489 --> 00:06:41,741
Who's looking after
your witness now?

103
00:06:41,783 --> 00:06:44,327
NOLA PD, Your Honor.

104
00:06:46,246 --> 00:06:48,248
I want him put
in courthouse custody

105
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:51,042
- while I make a decision.
- Okay.

106
00:06:55,046 --> 00:06:58,383
I love this one.

107
00:06:58,425 --> 00:07:00,552
This guy's pretty cool.

108
00:07:00,593 --> 00:07:02,262
I feel like you could stop
on every page.

109
00:07:02,345 --> 00:07:03,346
Yeah.

110
00:07:03,388 --> 00:07:05,974
- Wow, this one.
- Mm-hmm.

111
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:10,103
- Yeah...
- Here.

112
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,356
A present.

113
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,276
Two presents.

114
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:18,361
Oh. Why two?

115
00:07:18,403 --> 00:07:21,364
For Infinite Jest.
You need two.

116
00:07:21,406 --> 00:07:22,907
You need one for the main text,

117
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:24,826
and then one for the footnotes.

118
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:27,620
Once you're in, you probably
won't want to see me.

119
00:07:27,704 --> 00:07:30,832
It makes a hermit
of every reader.

120
00:07:30,874 --> 00:07:31,958
Adam...

121
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,210
God, I love seeing my students

122
00:07:34,294 --> 00:07:35,753
learning in the wild.

123
00:07:35,795 --> 00:07:38,798
Oh, sorry, Frannie.
Adam's photography teacher.

124
00:07:38,882 --> 00:07:41,718
- Oh, hi. Fia.
- Hi.

125
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,179
All his favorite photographers
are women.

126
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,473
And of them all,
probably Vivian.

127
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:48,850
Right, Adam?

128
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:50,143
Yeah.

129
00:07:50,185 --> 00:07:52,854
I love Vivian Maier.

130
00:07:52,937 --> 00:07:56,483
I mean, I really love her.

131
00:07:59,611 --> 00:08:01,654
But not as much as
I love your shoes.

132
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:04,407
Oh. Uh, yeah, thanks.

133
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:05,885
Actually, why do people
say thank you

134
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:08,536
when someone says they like
what you're wearing? I mean,

135
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,788
it's not like I made these
myself or anything.

136
00:08:10,872 --> 00:08:13,583
Yeah,
but you-you chose them, right?

137
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:17,128
And when it comes down to it,
the choices we make...

138
00:08:18,755 --> 00:08:20,798
Well, anyway,

139
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,800
it was really nice to meet you.
Fia, right?

140
00:08:22,842 --> 00:08:24,969
- Such a pretty name.
- Thank you.

141
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:26,554
- Short for Sofia?
- Yes.

142
00:08:26,638 --> 00:08:29,349
- Italian?
- Yeah, on my Mom's side.

143
00:08:29,432 --> 00:08:32,393
- Dad's side?
- Scottish. Baxter.

144
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:34,687
Baxter...

145
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:38,483
- as in the hotel in the Quarter?
- Mm-hmm.

146
00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:42,779
Oh... Well, I should get going.

147
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,739
School.

148
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:48,201
- It was a pleasure, Fia.
- Thank you.

149
00:09:10,723 --> 00:09:12,308
Costello here.

150
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,853
Are you sure?

151
00:09:16,813 --> 00:09:18,731
Okay.

152
00:09:20,483 --> 00:09:22,235
No, that's it.

153
00:09:28,116 --> 00:09:31,035
I know that Robin
was having an affair.

154
00:09:31,077 --> 00:09:34,038
I... Not the details, but...

155
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,249
I knew.

156
00:09:36,332 --> 00:09:39,210
- Christ, you knew?!
- Yes.

157
00:09:39,252 --> 00:09:40,795
And you didn't tell us?

158
00:09:40,878 --> 00:09:42,088
This guy's a prime suspect

159
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,148
- in your wife's murder.
- I ju...

160
00:09:43,172 --> 00:09:45,008
What the hell were you thinking?

161
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:46,301
Adam.

162
00:09:46,384 --> 00:09:48,761
Adam doesn't know.

163
00:09:49,637 --> 00:09:51,806
W... Okay, well,
you have to tell him.

164
00:09:51,848 --> 00:09:56,311
Nancy, his mother
was a wonderful woman.

165
00:09:56,352 --> 00:10:00,440
And he has nothing
but great memories of her

166
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:02,942
and-and who she was.

167
00:10:04,027 --> 00:10:05,695
I don't want to destroy that.

168
00:10:05,737 --> 00:10:08,615
- So what are you saying?
- I need to get this trial over,

169
00:10:08,656 --> 00:10:13,620
and-and when it is,
I can get my life back.

170
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,790
But I cannot cope now.

171
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:22,128
Don't ask me to do it. Please.

172
00:10:24,255 --> 00:10:27,467
This is a hotel.

173
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:33,723
Right.

174
00:10:33,765 --> 00:10:35,933
Paid with cash.

175
00:10:35,975 --> 00:10:37,810
In a fake name.

176
00:10:42,523 --> 00:10:45,026
I see.

177
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:48,613
Robin was...

178
00:10:48,696 --> 00:10:50,740
Yeah.

179
00:10:50,782 --> 00:10:52,158
Wow.

180
00:10:52,241 --> 00:10:53,701
- God.
- I'm sorry.

181
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:57,038
Doing your job.

182
00:11:02,502 --> 00:11:05,088
- Michael?
- He knows.

183
00:11:07,006 --> 00:11:10,426
And Adam?

184
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:15,181
Does he have to know?

185
00:11:15,223 --> 00:11:17,183
It's gonna come out.

186
00:11:24,148 --> 00:11:26,859
You're asking me to tell him.

187
00:11:30,488 --> 00:11:33,032
Joey Maldini
connects all the dots.

188
00:11:33,074 --> 00:11:35,743
Corroborates every aspect
of the prosecution's case

189
00:11:35,827 --> 00:11:37,745
and puts a skewer
right through the heart

190
00:11:37,787 --> 00:11:40,289
of the whole self-defense idea.

191
00:11:40,331 --> 00:11:42,417
He tells us
Carlo confesses to him,

192
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,001
he tells us
Gina was instrumental

193
00:11:44,085 --> 00:11:45,962
in getting Carlo moved to OPP.

194
00:11:46,003 --> 00:11:47,588
Gina Baxter isn't on trial.

195
00:11:47,672 --> 00:11:49,590
- She might be soon.
- Oh, God.

196
00:11:49,632 --> 00:11:54,679
Look, this trial is
about a single moment in a cell

197
00:11:54,721 --> 00:11:59,851
and what was in the minds
of two men in that moment.

198
00:11:59,892 --> 00:12:02,270
But we can't know what that was

199
00:12:02,353 --> 00:12:04,564
unless we look
at the broader context.

200
00:12:04,647 --> 00:12:07,859
- Joey gives us the whole story.
- Prejudice massively

201
00:12:07,942 --> 00:12:10,611
outweighs the probative value
of this witness, Your Honor.

202
00:12:10,653 --> 00:12:13,239
He means he's going down
and he doesn't like it.

203
00:12:13,322 --> 00:12:15,366
Slow,

204
00:12:55,573 --> 00:12:57,283
Okay, that's...

205
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,039
He knows Kofi wasn't driving.

206
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,374
My guess is that Joey would want

207
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:08,336
to talk about that on the stand,

208
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:13,090
how the victim didn't do
what everybody thinks he did.

209
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,762
And maybe then people start
looking for who was driving.

210
00:13:23,935 --> 00:13:28,314
Why were you down here that day?

211
00:13:31,484 --> 00:13:35,988
My wife was murdered
near here a year ago.

212
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:40,535
It was the anniversary, so I...

213
00:13:40,576 --> 00:13:44,205
I wanted to...
I needed to be there.

214
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,001
Was he dead when you left him?

215
00:13:52,213 --> 00:13:54,549
- Yes.
- Don't lie to me.

216
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,386
He was dead.

217
00:14:02,014 --> 00:14:04,308
Let me ask you something.

218
00:14:06,102 --> 00:14:07,895
Do you wake up
screaming in the night

219
00:14:07,937 --> 00:14:11,148
because you killed
a 17-year-old boy?

220
00:14:16,863 --> 00:14:18,698
Yes.

221
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,325
Good.

222
00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:25,663
Look at me.

223
00:14:25,746 --> 00:14:27,915
Dark,

224
00:14:31,043 --> 00:14:34,130
My family's not losing
another child.

225
00:14:35,673 --> 00:14:39,552
There's nothing
I wouldn't do. Nothing.

226
00:14:43,556 --> 00:14:47,184
So if you don't like it,
I really don't give a fuck.

227
00:14:48,227 --> 00:14:50,897
And if there's trial fallout?

228
00:14:50,938 --> 00:14:53,774
Well, that's your department,
isn't it?

229
00:14:57,445 --> 00:15:00,031
Joey's a junkie.

230
00:15:00,114 --> 00:15:04,243
He'll just be stepping off
a little early.

231
00:15:05,453 --> 00:15:08,289
We're not asking
for your permission.

232
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:11,083
We're telling you to set it up.

233
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:22,219
When we go back into court,

234
00:15:22,261 --> 00:15:27,183
I will rule that the witness
can testify.

235
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:29,060
You...

236
00:15:29,143 --> 00:15:33,147
you have Johnny Zander
ask for a recess

237
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:36,067
until tomorrow
to prepare for cross.

238
00:15:37,735 --> 00:15:41,197
It'd be a fair request,

239
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,698
and I'll grant it.

240
00:15:42,782 --> 00:15:44,784
You'll have the night.

241
00:15:46,327 --> 00:15:49,246
How you get to him...

242
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:55,962
...well, that's your department,
isn't it?

243
00:16:03,427 --> 00:16:05,638
Hey.

244
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:08,307
You're vaping just like
the kids, huh?

245
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:10,267
It's a terrible habit.

246
00:16:10,351 --> 00:16:12,687
Nothing illegal?

247
00:16:14,397 --> 00:16:18,985
You know, I-I hear that
Joey Maldini has a drug problem.

248
00:16:19,068 --> 00:16:21,320
I mean, angel from heaven
and everything,

249
00:16:21,404 --> 00:16:24,657
but still a little fucked up?

250
00:16:25,282 --> 00:16:27,201
- He's hanging in there.
- Oh.

251
00:16:27,284 --> 00:16:28,619
Okay.

252
00:16:30,162 --> 00:16:33,499
Is it just the murder,

253
00:16:33,582 --> 00:16:38,337
or is he swimming deep enough
to reveal the whole iceberg?

254
00:16:41,173 --> 00:16:44,385
I mean, no one's gonna get
in Fiona McKee's way now.

255
00:16:44,468 --> 00:16:46,029
You know? We figure
let her win this one,

256
00:16:46,053 --> 00:16:47,972
then we'll get him talking
about the rest.

257
00:16:48,055 --> 00:16:50,725
Obviously, Special Crimes
is a little overexcited.

258
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:52,977
But this should be you, right?

259
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,562
Fiona said he came to you.

260
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:56,522
You're the one
who got him talking.

261
00:16:58,107 --> 00:17:00,151
Don't sell yourself short,
Nancy.

262
00:17:00,234 --> 00:17:03,446
Or else some big, dumb
slab of beef

263
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,990
will be stealing
the career-defining case

264
00:17:06,073 --> 00:17:07,867
you could've made.

265
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,202
I mean, this is yours.

266
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:13,122
It's big.

267
00:17:13,914 --> 00:17:18,502
Listen, if it ever starts to
feel like it's getting too big,

268
00:17:18,586 --> 00:17:22,757
and you need someone
to talk to about this,

269
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,426
Cusack, whatever,

270
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:28,095
I'm here.

271
00:17:28,137 --> 00:17:31,057
Thanks.

272
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:36,353
I've got to sort through
a couple things.

273
00:17:36,395 --> 00:17:38,230
See you.

274
00:18:07,593 --> 00:18:08,844
Hey.

275
00:18:08,886 --> 00:18:11,347
Think I'm not watching?

276
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,766
I see you.

277
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:14,975
Excuse me?

278
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:16,811
I want you to stay away
from them.

279
00:18:16,894 --> 00:18:18,771
Michael, Adam.

280
00:18:20,731 --> 00:18:22,108
Adam?

281
00:18:22,191 --> 00:18:24,902
Don't pretend you don't know
who I'm talking about.

282
00:18:29,198 --> 00:18:32,034
You fuck with him,
you fuck with me.

283
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:42,128
Adam?

284
00:19:43,564 --> 00:19:45,399
Did the count.

285
00:19:45,441 --> 00:19:47,359
$9,310.

286
00:19:47,443 --> 00:19:50,738
Well, ain't we showing
initiative?

287
00:19:50,821 --> 00:19:53,699
I'm good with money.
Ask Little Mo.

288
00:19:53,741 --> 00:19:56,577
Even had a teacher tell me I got
a facility for the numbers.

289
00:19:56,619 --> 00:19:58,954
A facility?

290
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:04,168
So bad at math I'm good at it.

291
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:07,213
How that work?

292
00:20:07,922 --> 00:20:10,257
Uh, you can't do that shit
on paper,

293
00:20:10,341 --> 00:20:13,510
so you got to do it
in your head.

294
00:20:13,552 --> 00:20:15,179
Keep doing it in your head
over and over,

295
00:20:15,221 --> 00:20:16,430
the better you get.

296
00:20:16,513 --> 00:20:18,057
That be the equation,
you feel me?

297
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,893
Who's that
motherfucking scientist?

298
00:20:20,935 --> 00:20:24,521
The wheelchair dude,
with the voice.

299
00:20:24,563 --> 00:20:26,440
Stephen Hawking.

300
00:20:26,523 --> 00:20:29,443
Yeah, we got our own
Stephen motherfucking Hawking

301
00:20:29,526 --> 00:20:32,363
in the Lower Nine.

302
00:20:32,446 --> 00:20:35,074
I-I thought I could do,
like, payroll

303
00:20:35,115 --> 00:20:37,117
or help build the bank.

304
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:41,538
You can have
that no-good half of a man

305
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,958
But please

306
00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:47,503
Don't mess with my man...

307
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,271
Build the bank how?

308
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,945
You ever think about using
the church to clean money?

309
00:21:14,238 --> 00:21:17,574
Like the one down on Caffin
that need a new roof?

310
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:21,745
You give them a cash loan,
help them fix it up.

311
00:21:21,829 --> 00:21:25,708
Then they issue you back
a legit check.

312
00:21:25,749 --> 00:21:29,461
There's a lot of churches
that need help down here.

313
00:21:31,588 --> 00:21:34,258
This might be
the hardest decision

314
00:21:34,341 --> 00:21:37,511
I've ever had to make
as a judge.

315
00:21:37,594 --> 00:21:41,348
I've listened to both sides'
arguments with great care,

316
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:45,686
but there's one more thing that
I need to know before I decide.

317
00:21:45,769 --> 00:21:48,856
Joey Maldini is struggling

318
00:21:48,897 --> 00:21:53,402
with drug withdrawal,
and I need to know for myself

319
00:21:53,485 --> 00:21:54,862
that he's up to this.

320
00:21:54,903 --> 00:21:56,655
I've taken a good look at that,
Your Honor.

321
00:21:56,739 --> 00:21:57,990
He'll be fine.

322
00:21:58,073 --> 00:22:00,743
But as I said, Ms. McKee,

323
00:22:00,784 --> 00:22:03,120
I'd like to see that for myself.

324
00:22:03,203 --> 00:22:04,663
Unless there's a problem.

325
00:22:04,705 --> 00:22:05,873
No?

326
00:22:05,914 --> 00:22:09,084
Good. All right.

327
00:22:09,126 --> 00:22:10,794
Uh, no, no, no.

328
00:22:10,878 --> 00:22:13,422
Just-just Alan in chambers,
if you don't mind.

329
00:22:13,505 --> 00:22:16,383
Let's keep
our social distancing, huh?

330
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:17,885
Thank you.

331
00:22:24,641 --> 00:22:27,394
Well, I'm Michael Desiato.

332
00:22:27,478 --> 00:22:30,230
I'm presiding over this trial.

333
00:22:30,314 --> 00:22:33,859
You, uh, look a little nervous,
young man.

334
00:22:34,735 --> 00:22:36,820
Wouldn't you be?

335
00:22:37,571 --> 00:22:39,615
Yeah.

336
00:22:39,656 --> 00:22:43,327
I'll let you in on
a little secret. I... Oh, Alan.

337
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:47,122
Would you get Mr. Maldini
a glass, please?

338
00:22:47,164 --> 00:22:48,749
I get nervous, too.

339
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,501
- Always have.
- Here you go.

340
00:22:50,584 --> 00:22:51,960
Ah, thank you.

341
00:22:52,002 --> 00:22:54,505
So I had to come up
with a strategy

342
00:22:54,588 --> 00:22:56,507
in order to deal with it.

343
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:01,387
Are you familiar
with W.H. Auden, the poet?

344
00:23:03,263 --> 00:23:05,474
"Thousands have lived
without love,

345
00:23:05,516 --> 00:23:07,393
not one without water."

346
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:12,606
So, when I feel overwhelmed,

347
00:23:12,689 --> 00:23:16,276
or if I feel
I'm heading that way,

348
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:21,281
I just take a moment, breathe
and take a sip of water.

349
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,411
God.

350
00:23:25,494 --> 00:23:28,747
They can't get
your boot back on, huh?

351
00:23:29,623 --> 00:23:31,125
Hey, you know what?

352
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:34,044
You look to be about my size.

353
00:23:37,131 --> 00:23:39,633
Let me, uh...

354
00:23:39,675 --> 00:23:42,261
Let me tell you what to expect.

355
00:23:42,344 --> 00:23:44,721
Now...

356
00:23:44,763 --> 00:23:46,723
you'll hear your name called

357
00:23:46,765 --> 00:23:49,601
and you'll come on up
to the stand.

358
00:23:49,685 --> 00:23:51,603
There you go.

359
00:23:51,645 --> 00:23:56,191
And you'll swear on the Bible
to tell the truth

360
00:23:56,233 --> 00:24:01,029
and then sit down,
at which point, if you just...

361
00:24:01,822 --> 00:24:03,365
...just look at me, okay?

362
00:24:03,449 --> 00:24:05,343
That way you don't have to see
the people in the court

363
00:24:05,367 --> 00:24:08,787
who really don't like
what you're doing.

364
00:24:08,871 --> 00:24:11,165
Here, let's try this.

365
00:24:11,206 --> 00:24:13,500
Take it, careful,
careful, careful.

366
00:24:15,586 --> 00:24:16,962
Okay.

367
00:24:18,213 --> 00:24:20,632
Yeah. That's it.

368
00:24:25,345 --> 00:24:30,392
So, at that point,
it's just a conversation

369
00:24:30,476 --> 00:24:34,021
between you and me, all right?

370
00:24:34,062 --> 00:24:36,148
One-on-one.

371
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:42,446
And you'll be fine.

372
00:24:45,282 --> 00:24:47,743
I'm ready to rule on this.

373
00:24:47,826 --> 00:24:49,328
I'm going to grant

374
00:24:49,411 --> 00:24:53,457
the state's application
to call Joey Maldini.

375
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,460
Your Honor,
the defense requests a recess

376
00:24:56,543 --> 00:24:59,338
until tomorrow
so we can prepare for cross.

377
00:25:01,256 --> 00:25:04,009
No. The witness is ready now.

378
00:25:04,092 --> 00:25:06,094
Dark,

379
00:25:07,554 --> 00:25:10,307
I think we all saw you limping.

380
00:25:12,267 --> 00:25:14,895
I broke my ankle.

381
00:25:14,937 --> 00:25:16,730
How?

382
00:25:19,316 --> 00:25:21,527
Jumping out
a second-story window.

383
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,403
When?

384
00:25:25,155 --> 00:25:26,865
A few hours ago.

385
00:25:26,907 --> 00:25:29,493
Why did you do that?

386
00:25:30,244 --> 00:25:33,455
To get away from some people.

387
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:35,541
What people?

388
00:25:39,586 --> 00:25:41,255
People who want me dead.

389
00:25:41,338 --> 00:25:43,131
- Who?
- Objection, Your Honor, th...

390
00:25:43,173 --> 00:25:45,634
I withdraw the question.

391
00:25:46,343 --> 00:25:49,221
Do you know the accused?

392
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,817
He's my best friend.

393
00:26:01,858 --> 00:26:04,278
How did you two first meet?

394
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:07,072
Me and Carlo came up together.

395
00:26:07,155 --> 00:26:10,993
Can't remember if we first met
at kindergarten or first grade,

396
00:26:11,076 --> 00:26:14,955
but he was, like, my bro.

397
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:17,082
My family's fucked up and...
Oh, shit,

398
00:26:17,124 --> 00:26:20,711
- am I not supposed to swear?
- You're doing just fine.

399
00:26:39,438 --> 00:26:41,690
Uh, yeah, so...

400
00:26:43,692 --> 00:26:46,695
the Baxters kind of took me in.

401
00:26:48,322 --> 00:26:51,700
They were a good family,
they, um,

402
00:26:51,783 --> 00:26:54,161
always had food in the fridge.

403
00:26:54,202 --> 00:26:59,166
And, uh... leftovers
in little plastic containers

404
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:04,421
with, uh, labels on them
so you'd know what's in them.

405
00:27:04,463 --> 00:27:08,592
Like... risotto.

406
00:27:08,675 --> 00:27:10,594
Or mac and cheese.

407
00:27:10,636 --> 00:27:12,679
And name-brand soda.

408
00:27:12,721 --> 00:27:15,599
So you two stayed close?

409
00:27:15,682 --> 00:27:17,100
Absolutely.

410
00:27:17,142 --> 00:27:19,853
But here you are
testifying against him.

411
00:27:23,273 --> 00:27:26,026
Um...

412
00:27:26,068 --> 00:27:28,654
Where I come from,
you don't snitch.

413
00:27:28,737 --> 00:27:30,739
You just don't, but...

414
00:27:30,822 --> 00:27:32,741
I can't keep living like this.

415
00:27:32,824 --> 00:27:34,534
Like what?

416
00:27:34,618 --> 00:27:36,703
Dark,

417
00:27:39,915 --> 00:27:41,667
Like what?

418
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:46,338
I loved the Baxters
like my family.

419
00:27:47,381 --> 00:27:48,548
But when your own family...

420
00:27:48,632 --> 00:27:51,259
Objection. The Baxter family
is not on trial here.

421
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:53,220
The witness can't
testify to the narrower facts

422
00:27:53,303 --> 00:27:56,139
if he doesn't put them
in their proper perspective.

423
00:27:56,181 --> 00:27:58,101
If Mr. Zander's gonna have
a problem with that...

424
00:27:58,141 --> 00:28:00,102
You may have bigger problems,
Ms. McKee.

425
00:28:00,143 --> 00:28:03,397
Let's-let's get this man
some medical attention, please?

426
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,357
Release the jury.

427
00:28:07,192 --> 00:28:09,277
Call the EMTs.

428
00:28:44,855 --> 00:28:49,568
Ladies and gentlemen,
I owe you an apology.

429
00:28:49,651 --> 00:28:51,987
I thought that I had made sure

430
00:28:52,028 --> 00:28:56,324
that the witness
was well enough to testify.

431
00:28:56,366 --> 00:28:58,285
But I was wrong.

432
00:28:58,368 --> 00:29:00,662
I made a mistake.

433
00:29:00,746 --> 00:29:04,291
So I'm afraid you'll have
to disregard

434
00:29:04,332 --> 00:29:08,336
everything
that Mr. Maldini said.

435
00:29:08,378 --> 00:29:11,381
His credibility is questionable,

436
00:29:11,423 --> 00:29:14,801
but what really matters
is that the defense

437
00:29:14,885 --> 00:29:17,429
wasn't able
to cross-examine him,

438
00:29:17,471 --> 00:29:21,224
so everything he's said
hasn't been tested,

439
00:29:21,266 --> 00:29:25,979
and that is what is really
unfair to the accused.

440
00:29:26,021 --> 00:29:29,524
So get rid
of the entire idea of him

441
00:29:29,566 --> 00:29:31,485
from your minds.

442
00:29:31,568 --> 00:29:34,780
For our purposes,

443
00:29:34,821 --> 00:29:38,658
Joey Maldini never existed.

444
00:30:01,348 --> 00:30:05,227
I'm-a break you off,
let me be your motivation...

445
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,937
Yeah!

446
00:30:06,978 --> 00:30:10,023
Baby, turn around, let me
give you innovation, hey

447
00:30:12,442 --> 00:30:15,570
You got that good-good,
baby, don't you?

448
00:30:15,654 --> 00:30:17,781
Got that good-good,
baby, don't you?

449
00:30:17,823 --> 00:30:20,033
That was on purpose, right?

450
00:30:20,116 --> 00:30:22,118
The cafÃ©?

451
00:30:23,578 --> 00:30:26,998
Yes. And thank God.

452
00:30:27,082 --> 00:30:28,762
You know, just...
Let me, let me explain...

453
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:30,961
Forget it's me saying this.

454
00:30:32,212 --> 00:30:34,798
Just think for a moment.

455
00:30:34,881 --> 00:30:38,426
You're crazy to be doing
what you're doing.

456
00:30:38,468 --> 00:30:40,303
I can't help it.

457
00:30:40,345 --> 00:30:42,639
What does that mean?

458
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:48,353
You know what it means.

459
00:30:53,191 --> 00:30:54,651
I'll tell you what it means,

460
00:30:54,693 --> 00:30:57,320
and I'll tell you
what you're mistaking it for.

461
00:30:57,362 --> 00:30:59,531
You think you're in love
with this girl.

462
00:30:59,614 --> 00:31:02,617
You're not.
You're fascinated by her.

463
00:31:02,701 --> 00:31:06,329
You're pulled towards her
because you killed her brother.

464
00:31:16,882 --> 00:31:19,384
You sound like a teacher.

465
00:31:34,524 --> 00:31:36,735
I love you.

466
00:31:37,777 --> 00:31:40,363
It's wrong,
it's a terrible mistake.

467
00:31:40,405 --> 00:31:43,241
I wish I didn't feel this way,
but I do.

468
00:31:43,283 --> 00:31:44,910
You're jealous.

469
00:31:45,869 --> 00:31:47,746
You want it to be that easy.

470
00:31:47,829 --> 00:31:48,955
Easy?

471
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,832
You want me to be
the bad teacher

472
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:53,335
turned into the jealous woman.

473
00:31:53,376 --> 00:31:55,086
It's not it.

474
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:58,089
I am begging you
to take responsibility

475
00:31:58,131 --> 00:32:00,675
for yourself, Adam.

476
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:03,720
For both your sakes,
you and Fia Baxter

477
00:32:03,762 --> 00:32:06,139
have to stop seeing each other.

478
00:32:06,222 --> 00:32:09,100
Or what? Y-You'd tell her?

479
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,734
Rehearsing and coaching
are not the same thing,

480
00:32:17,776 --> 00:32:22,906
which means I can tell you
how to say things

481
00:32:22,948 --> 00:32:25,951
but not what to say.

482
00:32:26,034 --> 00:32:28,411
- Understood?
- Sure.

483
00:32:28,495 --> 00:32:33,333
So, when Kofi Jones
walked into your cell,

484
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:38,797
what would be the one word to
describe how you were feeling?

485
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:48,348
Okay, if it were me,

486
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,849
how about terrified?

487
00:32:49,891 --> 00:32:53,144
Yeah, I-I don't know
about terrified.

488
00:32:53,228 --> 00:32:55,355
Here's the law. Here's the deal
with self-defense:

489
00:32:55,397 --> 00:32:57,107
I'm gonna put it
in your language, Carlo.

490
00:32:57,148 --> 00:32:59,734
You have to believe
that you are in immediate danger

491
00:32:59,818 --> 00:33:02,946
of being killed
or very seriously hurt

492
00:33:03,029 --> 00:33:06,241
and that deadly force
is needed to prevent it.

493
00:33:06,282 --> 00:33:08,576
Yeah. That.

494
00:33:08,618 --> 00:33:11,663
But notice how you didn't use
the word "terrified."

495
00:33:13,581 --> 00:33:15,333
Okay.

496
00:33:16,751 --> 00:33:18,962
Okay.

497
00:33:22,215 --> 00:33:24,342
How did your brother die?

498
00:33:29,472 --> 00:33:32,308
He died in a car crash.

499
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:35,145
- The car was driven by who?
- Kofi Jones.

500
00:33:35,228 --> 00:33:37,522
And did Kofi Jones

501
00:33:37,564 --> 00:33:40,483
leave your little brother
all alone,

502
00:33:40,567 --> 00:33:43,445
bleeding to death
on the side of the road

503
00:33:43,486 --> 00:33:47,699
with no one to hold his hand
or hear his last words?

504
00:33:47,782 --> 00:33:49,075
Yeah.

505
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:51,578
Speak it back to me,
with feeling.

506
00:33:51,661 --> 00:33:52,996
You just said it.

507
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:54,497
How did it make you feel, Carlo?

508
00:33:54,581 --> 00:33:55,832
- Mad.
- No.

509
00:33:55,874 --> 00:33:57,101
What the fuck
am I supposed to say?

510
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:59,085
- It rhymes with mad.
- Bad?

511
00:33:59,169 --> 00:34:01,046
- Oh, Jesus.
- Fucking sad.

512
00:34:03,214 --> 00:34:04,924
I'm so sorry for your loss.

513
00:34:05,008 --> 00:34:06,885
Sure.

514
00:34:07,969 --> 00:34:10,513
Okay.

515
00:34:10,597 --> 00:34:13,433
Here's my question, Carlo.

516
00:34:13,475 --> 00:34:18,271
Here's-here's the question.

517
00:34:18,313 --> 00:34:21,149
When the man who killed
your little brother

518
00:34:21,191 --> 00:34:25,028
walked into your cell and
you saw him standing there...

519
00:34:26,529 --> 00:34:30,658
...what was the first thought
that came into your head?

520
00:34:30,742 --> 00:34:33,286
Kill the motherfucker.

521
00:34:41,377 --> 00:34:45,381
Say, I ain't trying to get
all sappy or nothing like that,

522
00:34:45,465 --> 00:34:48,593
but... I just want
to thank you, you know?

523
00:34:48,676 --> 00:34:52,263
For-for bringing me in
and letting me stay.

524
00:34:52,305 --> 00:34:54,599
Of course, man.

525
00:34:57,727 --> 00:34:59,687
I knew you was good people.

526
00:34:59,771 --> 00:35:03,817
I mean, shit, look at you now.

527
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:09,030
Making financial propositions
to the mama herself.

528
00:35:11,407 --> 00:35:14,369
I knew you had weight on you.

529
00:35:14,452 --> 00:35:16,871
You know, Rudy,

530
00:35:16,955 --> 00:35:21,084
he was worried as all fuck
when you were joining in

531
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:23,419
and moving in,

532
00:35:23,503 --> 00:35:26,714
especially after
what went down with Kofi.

533
00:35:28,466 --> 00:35:30,593
But I told him...

534
00:35:32,178 --> 00:35:36,182
...that you smart
and that you loyal.

535
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,231
Who Rudy?

536
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,447
Oh, you ain't need to learn
all our secrets

537
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:54,159
in one day, old boy.

538
00:36:47,837 --> 00:36:50,048
Come, sit.

539
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:00,099
Doubts, I hear.

540
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:04,062
You haven't spoken to me
about these doubts,

541
00:37:04,103 --> 00:37:07,690
but you have spoken about them.

542
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,485
Why can't you believe
I am capable

543
00:37:10,526 --> 00:37:11,861
of forming my own opinions?

544
00:37:11,903 --> 00:37:14,197
Uh, there's no new relationship?

545
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,991
Nobody's feeding you
these thoughts

546
00:37:17,033 --> 00:37:18,952
at this difficult time?

547
00:37:19,035 --> 00:37:20,495
His name is Adam.

548
00:37:20,578 --> 00:37:23,581
Because of what happened,
you are vulnerable, Fia.

549
00:37:23,665 --> 00:37:25,041
You can be exploited.

550
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:27,085
- What are you saying?
- He appears as one thing.

551
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,128
My... Okay,
my boyfriend is the devil?

552
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:30,630
Is that... Mom, is this you?

553
00:37:30,713 --> 00:37:32,590
All right, my child.

554
00:37:32,674 --> 00:37:34,384
- Here's what we'll do.
- What are you...

555
00:37:34,425 --> 00:37:35,718
What are you talking about?

556
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,345
"Here's what we'll do"?

557
00:37:37,428 --> 00:37:39,806
This is none of your business.

558
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,141
- Fia.
- Sofia.

559
00:37:42,225 --> 00:37:44,852
- Fia. Hey.
- Fuck him. Fuck him.

560
00:37:44,894 --> 00:37:46,020
Who do they think they are?

561
00:37:46,104 --> 00:37:48,898
In confirmation class yesterday,
you know what he said?

562
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,026
"God spake unto Abraham,
'Kill him with a knife.'

563
00:37:52,068 --> 00:37:55,488
Your own son.
Your child, a sacrifice to me.

564
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,532
Build a bonfire
to put your dead son on,

565
00:37:57,573 --> 00:37:59,575
and ask him to help you collect
the wood first,

566
00:37:59,617 --> 00:38:01,452
lie to him
about what you're doing.'"

567
00:38:01,536 --> 00:38:03,246
And then,
"And now that you've proved,

568
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:05,373
by agreeing to murder
your child,

569
00:38:05,456 --> 00:38:08,543
that there is, there is no one,
no one you love more than me,

570
00:38:08,626 --> 00:38:09,895
you don't actually have
to do it."

571
00:38:09,919 --> 00:38:13,798
I mean, what kind of a fucking
deranged despot is that?

572
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,884
- Sweetheart...
- This is not you.

573
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,763
It is me. It's all me.

574
00:38:22,056 --> 00:38:24,309
Do you love him?

575
00:38:25,977 --> 00:38:28,980
No. I hate him.

576
00:38:30,565 --> 00:38:34,819
Your mother meant Adam, Fia,
not God.

577
00:38:37,989 --> 00:38:41,159
Would you do it, Dad?

578
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,494
If God asked you to?

579
00:38:45,246 --> 00:38:47,790
Mom?

580
00:38:47,832 --> 00:38:51,210
Would you kill me
if God asked you to do it?

581
00:38:51,961 --> 00:38:55,506
Do you love him?

582
00:38:57,425 --> 00:39:01,512
Yes. Yes, I love him.

583
00:39:09,854 --> 00:39:15,026
Wha... I know when my godson
is holding something back.

584
00:39:22,367 --> 00:39:25,244
Yeah, I might have

585
00:39:25,328 --> 00:39:29,999
gotten myself into something
that's kind of messy.

586
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:32,835
The girlfriend?

587
00:39:32,919 --> 00:39:36,130
- There's another thing.
- What?

588
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:42,095
- There are two.
- Girlfriends?

589
00:39:43,346 --> 00:39:46,140
Uh...

590
00:39:46,224 --> 00:39:49,727
One of them is my teacher.

591
00:39:51,145 --> 00:39:53,356
Oh.

592
00:39:54,565 --> 00:39:56,734
Whoa.

593
00:39:59,529 --> 00:40:01,781
So let me guess.

594
00:40:01,823 --> 00:40:03,908
You like the other one.

595
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:06,035
"Like" isn't the right word.

596
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:07,620
Okay.

597
00:40:07,662 --> 00:40:10,373
And Mrs. Robinson is upset.

598
00:40:12,333 --> 00:40:15,294
Okay. Yeah.

599
00:40:15,336 --> 00:40:17,380
I got this.

600
00:40:17,422 --> 00:40:19,257
No, I...

601
00:40:19,298 --> 00:40:21,217
Hmm?

602
00:40:21,259 --> 00:40:22,802
I got myself into this.

603
00:40:22,885 --> 00:40:24,303
I should get myself out of it.

604
00:40:24,387 --> 00:40:26,597
- Well, that sounds...
- It's what it is.

605
00:40:26,681 --> 00:40:29,600
I got it.

606
00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:33,438
Sure.

607
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,641
If you're here to try to get me
to go see that motherfucker

608
00:40:52,665 --> 00:40:53,958
lie under oath,

609
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,502
I'd rather be making money.

610
00:40:56,544 --> 00:40:58,045
What's this?

611
00:40:58,129 --> 00:41:00,590
Results from Kofi's GED exam.

612
00:41:07,472 --> 00:41:09,432
- Says he failed.
- He did.

613
00:41:09,515 --> 00:41:10,993
Look at the date though,
look at the time.

614
00:41:11,017 --> 00:41:14,228
Kofi was busy failing
his GED exam...

615
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:18,232
the same time
that Rocco Baxter was killed.

616
00:41:19,817 --> 00:41:22,987
Which means Kofi covered
for someone.

617
00:41:23,946 --> 00:41:26,949
Desire asked him
to take the fall.

618
00:41:27,033 --> 00:41:31,078
So it has to be someone
in the crew who killed Rocco.

619
00:41:32,163 --> 00:41:34,665
The people you call family now?

620
00:41:34,707 --> 00:41:36,876
They're the ones
who let the Baxters

621
00:41:36,959 --> 00:41:40,046
think that Kofi was responsible
for killing Rocco.

622
00:41:40,087 --> 00:41:44,675
They put the "X" on his back and
then they turned the other way.

623
00:41:45,885 --> 00:41:47,762
I know they took you in.

624
00:41:47,845 --> 00:41:51,098
I know you think you owe them
something for that.

625
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,310
But has it ever occurred to you

626
00:41:54,393 --> 00:41:56,562
that maybe the reason
they're keeping you so close

627
00:41:56,604 --> 00:42:00,525
is because they sold your
brother down the Mississippi?

628
00:42:04,237 --> 00:42:06,239
Where was Little Mo that day?

629
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,698
That would explain...

630
00:42:07,782 --> 00:42:08,783
Rudy.

631
00:42:08,866 --> 00:42:10,326
Rudy?

632
00:42:10,409 --> 00:42:12,662
Who's-who's Rudy?

633
00:42:13,871 --> 00:42:16,123
He's in Desire?

634
00:42:16,207 --> 00:42:17,708
You think he was driving?

635
00:42:18,834 --> 00:42:21,254
I don't know who he is, but...

636
00:42:21,295 --> 00:42:25,091
Little Mo said that he was
worried that I was joining

637
00:42:25,174 --> 00:42:27,593
after what had went down
with Kofi.

638
00:42:27,677 --> 00:42:28,761
What else did he say?

639
00:42:28,844 --> 00:42:30,388
What exactly, Eugene?

640
00:42:30,471 --> 00:42:32,098
- Word for word.
- I don't remember.

641
00:42:32,139 --> 00:42:35,059
I mean, we was drinking
and stuff and I don't remember.

642
00:42:35,101 --> 00:42:37,270
Wh-What did he say?

643
00:42:37,311 --> 00:42:40,314
It's important.

644
00:42:45,236 --> 00:42:48,072
He said he was worried,
like I told you.

645
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:54,328
But... Little Mo told him
not to trip, 'cause...

646
00:42:54,412 --> 00:42:56,080
I'm smarter than Kofi.

647
00:42:56,122 --> 00:42:57,873
And I'm more loyal.

648
00:42:57,957 --> 00:42:59,792
"More loyal"?

649
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:02,211
That's so warped.

650
00:43:03,963 --> 00:43:06,966
So I can look into this Rudy?

651
00:43:27,445 --> 00:43:29,363
You're a teacher?

652
00:43:29,447 --> 00:43:32,450
Yeah, high school photography.

653
00:43:33,618 --> 00:43:35,870
So a real vocation?

654
00:43:35,953 --> 00:43:38,581
On good days, yes. I love it.

655
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:41,500
On lesser ones it can feel
more like babysitting.

656
00:43:43,669 --> 00:43:45,921
Charlie Figaro.

657
00:43:45,963 --> 00:43:49,383
Are you, uh, looking for my vote

658
00:43:49,467 --> 00:43:51,218
or are you hitting on me?

659
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,928
It's a little difficult to tell.

660
00:43:54,597 --> 00:43:57,391
I'd have thought you'd be
kind of expert on reading

661
00:43:57,475 --> 00:43:59,644
what is and isn't appropriate,

662
00:43:59,727 --> 00:44:01,937
Miss Latimer.

663
00:44:02,605 --> 00:44:05,358
You being a teacher
and everything.

664
00:44:06,776 --> 00:44:08,444
- How did you know my...
- No, no, see,

665
00:44:08,486 --> 00:44:10,946
I'm doing the talking now.

666
00:44:13,616 --> 00:44:15,868
I want you to listen
more carefully

667
00:44:15,951 --> 00:44:19,246
than you have ever listened
to anything in your life.

668
00:44:20,956 --> 00:44:24,377
This can only end badly for you.

669
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,212
This comes out, uh...

670
00:44:26,253 --> 00:44:27,630
you go to jail.

671
00:44:27,672 --> 00:44:30,257
You become
a registered sex offender

672
00:44:30,299 --> 00:44:33,135
and everything that
that brings with it.

673
00:44:33,219 --> 00:44:35,805
And your vocation?

674
00:44:35,846 --> 00:44:38,808
This thing you love?

675
00:44:38,891 --> 00:44:41,352
Dead forever.

676
00:44:42,728 --> 00:44:44,105
But none of this

677
00:44:44,188 --> 00:44:45,898
needs happen.

678
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:48,651
If you stop now.

679
00:44:51,278 --> 00:44:54,031
Do the right thing,
Miss Latimer.

680
00:44:55,616 --> 00:44:58,369
You feel me?

681
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,414
What about Adam?

682
00:45:01,497 --> 00:45:02,540
I got him.

683
00:45:02,623 --> 00:45:04,667
You ain't got
to worry about that.

684
00:45:06,043 --> 00:45:08,671
- He told you?
- Yeah.

685
00:45:08,713 --> 00:45:10,506
Was it hard for him?

686
00:45:10,589 --> 00:45:11,757
Now, now, see?

687
00:45:11,841 --> 00:45:14,218
I don't think
you heard me right.

688
00:45:16,303 --> 00:45:18,389
Now you need to stop it.

689
00:45:18,472 --> 00:45:20,266
Step off.

690
00:45:20,349 --> 00:45:23,018
I got him. He'll be fine.

691
00:45:23,102 --> 00:45:24,937
I don't know.

692
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,522
I know my godson.

693
00:45:26,605 --> 00:45:28,566
He's 17 years old.

694
00:45:28,607 --> 00:45:30,818
Exactly.

695
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:36,115
It's not easy to watch
somebody die in the gutter

696
00:45:36,198 --> 00:45:40,327
and have to live with the guilt
of knowing you did it.

697
00:45:40,411 --> 00:45:44,582
And when you're sensitive
and sweet and 17...

698
00:45:50,755 --> 00:45:53,090
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

699
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,302
Adam?

700
00:46:01,432 --> 00:46:03,726
Ten minutes. And you owe me.

701
00:46:03,809 --> 00:46:06,103
I promise wherever I land,

702
00:46:06,145 --> 00:46:08,272
I will take you with me.

703
00:46:08,355 --> 00:46:10,399
Slow,

704
00:46:46,435 --> 00:46:49,104
Earl Grey still?

705
00:46:50,314 --> 00:46:53,150
You're not my assistant
anymore, Freya.

706
00:46:54,276 --> 00:46:58,113
Mostly I'm just curious about
what the hell you're doing.

707
00:47:00,533 --> 00:47:03,369
Found a cop who's arrested
a dealer many times,

708
00:47:03,452 --> 00:47:06,664
and yet none of those
arrests have led to charges.

709
00:47:07,581 --> 00:47:09,583
What does that tell you?

710
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:13,295
Either the dealer's an informant

711
00:47:13,337 --> 00:47:15,756
or the cop's dirty.

712
00:47:15,798 --> 00:47:17,800
Or both.

713
00:48:10,394 --> 00:48:13,105
How much?

714
00:48:15,357 --> 00:48:16,837
Hmm?

715
00:48:16,838 --> 00:48:19,862
- Hmm?
- How much do you love him?

716
00:48:22,448 --> 00:48:25,534
With all my heart.

717
00:48:28,621 --> 00:48:31,498
I'd like to meet him.

718
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:35,502
Okay.

719
00:48:35,544 --> 00:48:38,422
Great. Uh, when?

720
00:48:42,134 --> 00:48:44,595
Now?

721
00:48:47,932 --> 00:48:50,768
Now would be good.

722
00:49:08,494 --> 00:49:10,079
Hey.

723
00:49:10,162 --> 00:49:13,123
Hey, uh,
I was just about to head out.

724
00:49:13,165 --> 00:49:15,834
Oh, yeah? Where you headed?

725
00:49:18,504 --> 00:49:21,340
Oh, okay.

726
00:49:21,382 --> 00:49:23,467
Girlfriend?

727
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:25,219
Yeah.

728
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,972
Well, have a good time.

729
00:49:29,306 --> 00:49:31,684
You gonna be gone long?

730
00:49:31,767 --> 00:49:33,769
Uh, I don't know.

731
00:49:33,811 --> 00:49:35,479
Okay, well,

732
00:49:35,562 --> 00:49:38,399
I'll wait up for you.

733
00:49:39,305 --> 00:50:39,789

<i>Actually, he was murdered.</i>

4
00:00:05,713 --> 00:00:07,940
After being tortured
by the NOPD.

5
00:00:11,485 --> 00:00:13,404
Fucking motherfucker
killed my brother.

6
00:00:13,489 --> 00:00:14,768
My baby brother.

7
00:00:14,853 --> 00:00:16,813
I was taking care of it!

8
00:00:17,928 --> 00:00:19,291
That's not what
Mom said.

9
00:00:19,376 --> 00:00:20,971
There's no homicides in my jail.

10
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:22,229
And this never happened.

11
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:25,253
You haven't even spoken
to the family yet?

12
00:00:26,397 --> 00:00:28,291
Kofi dead.

13
00:00:28,886 --> 00:00:29,932
What?

14
00:00:30,186 --> 00:00:31,595
Your brother was fam.

15
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,014
That means you fam.

16
00:00:33,892 --> 00:00:35,819
We got eyes on you,
little man.

17
00:00:42,523 --> 00:00:43,538
Watch her.

18
00:00:43,623 --> 00:00:44,765
Bring her back.

19
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,343
Why don't you just buy her
a motorcycle?

20
00:00:51,935 --> 00:00:53,358
Oh.

21
00:00:54,374 --> 00:00:55,773
Hey, sorry.

22
00:00:57,573 --> 00:00:59,351
Th-That's okay, um...

23
00:01:00,245 --> 00:01:03,687
Adam, after the
accident, did you stop anywhere?

24
00:01:03,838 --> 00:01:05,624
I-I stopped for gas.

25
00:01:09,726 --> 00:01:11,257
It was Desire payback.

26
00:01:11,342 --> 00:01:13,757
If we do nothing,
we look weak.

27
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:15,476
The city is waiting.

All right, Counselor,
what's the story?

32
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:57,887
Uh, theft of meat
from Rouse's on De Gaulle.

33
00:02:58,788 --> 00:03:00,265
And what are you offering?

34
00:03:00,386 --> 00:03:01,741
Four years.

35
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:03,421
For stealing meat?

36
00:03:03,506 --> 00:03:05,452
$502 dollars of meat.

37
00:03:05,676 --> 00:03:07,921
Why'd you do that,
Mr. James?

38
00:03:11,932 --> 00:03:13,616
I wanted my family back.

39
00:03:13,701 --> 00:03:15,007
What does that mean?

40
00:03:15,143 --> 00:03:17,194
Well, my wife told me
I was dead to her.

41
00:03:17,345 --> 00:03:19,483
- When?
- Three months ago.

42
00:03:19,906 --> 00:03:21,075
Why?

43
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:23,179
Booze.

44
00:03:24,757 --> 00:03:25,835
You don't look...

45
00:03:25,928 --> 00:03:27,741
I've been sober
59 days now.

46
00:03:28,297 --> 00:03:29,297
Good.

47
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:32,554
So where are you living?

48
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,765
Claiborne.

49
00:03:34,525 --> 00:03:35,913
Where on Claiborne?

50
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:37,294
Under it.

51
00:03:43,314 --> 00:03:44,648
Whose phone is that?

52
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,733
It was our tenth
wedding anniversary.

53
00:03:52,353 --> 00:03:54,710
The day we got married,
we had a barbecue for everybody.

54
00:03:56,315 --> 00:03:58,257
I just wanted to show her
what I've done.

55
00:03:58,427 --> 00:03:59,499
I've given up the booze.

56
00:03:59,584 --> 00:04:00,835
Holding it all together.

57
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:02,452
I thought maybe
she'd have me back

58
00:04:02,537 --> 00:04:04,890
if I could just turn
the clock back ten years.

59
00:04:05,498 --> 00:04:07,608
But I ain't had no money,
so...

60
00:04:07,693 --> 00:04:09,405
So you stole the meat.

61
00:04:12,363 --> 00:04:14,124
It's difficult

62
00:04:14,781 --> 00:04:16,241
to... give up drinking.

63
00:04:16,326 --> 00:04:18,694
Yeah, Mojo Coffee House
saved my life.

64
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:22,421
I go to a 6 a.m. AA meeting
every morning, rain or shine.

65
00:04:22,646 --> 00:04:23,890
Proof of that?

66
00:04:24,048 --> 00:04:25,538
Me standing right here.

67
00:04:26,155 --> 00:04:29,202
I'm betting you don't need no
piece a paper to judge a man by.

68
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:31,819
You can see
right inside of a man.

69
00:04:32,348 --> 00:04:33,429
Am I right?

70
00:04:34,915 --> 00:04:36,288
Well, here I am.

71
00:04:37,212 --> 00:04:40,030
Ain't no way you wouldn't know
if I wasn't telling the truth.

72
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,163
A daily meeting at Mojo's,
uh, stands a better chance

73
00:04:44,248 --> 00:04:47,335
at putting this man's life back
together than time in prison.

74
00:04:47,558 --> 00:04:49,394
It's not my life
I'm worried about.

75
00:04:51,572 --> 00:04:52,998
It's my boy.

76
00:04:56,134 --> 00:04:58,296
I want him to have a father
that's gonna provide

77
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,530
and keep him safe.

78
00:05:02,006 --> 00:05:03,296
I just want him
to have somebody

79
00:05:03,381 --> 00:05:04,749
that he can be
proud of.

80
00:05:05,247 --> 00:05:06,421
That's it.

81
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,116
That's all I got.

82
00:05:09,623 --> 00:05:11,077
Jesus, please.

83
00:05:12,116 --> 00:05:13,233
Come on.

84
00:05:41,582 --> 00:05:44,016
Sorry, Mr. James,
I'm gonna put you

85
00:05:44,101 --> 00:05:46,187
out of your misery
right now.

86
00:05:46,905 --> 00:05:48,343
12 months probation.

87
00:05:48,734 --> 00:05:50,726
- Call a recess.
- Recess!

88
00:05:51,032 --> 00:05:52,971
We'll resume in 15 minutes.

89
00:06:03,924 --> 00:06:05,269
Is there anything
I can do, Judge?

90
00:06:05,354 --> 00:06:06,719
Uh, no.

91
00:06:06,804 --> 00:06:08,447
I'm good, Alan.
Thank you.

92
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,486
Oh, uh, Alan,
wait a second.

93
00:06:11,142 --> 00:06:14,050
When you come in
and open up the courtroom

94
00:06:14,135 --> 00:06:18,103
in the morning, are there times
when you go back out again?

95
00:06:18,697 --> 00:06:20,618
Yeah, I come
and go a little.

96
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,378
Okay.
So the courtroom is

97
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:25,711
open and empty?

98
00:06:27,616 --> 00:06:28,922
Okay.

99
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,337
Is there anything wrong, Judge?

100
00:06:31,422 --> 00:06:32,782
No, uh, no.

101
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:34,923
No, but would you
please tell Betty

102
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:36,304
I had to leave?

103
00:06:40,194 --> 00:06:41,297
Shit.

104
00:06:46,168 --> 00:06:47,398
Call Adam.

105
00:06:48,203 --> 00:06:50,218
This is Adam.
Leave a message.

106
00:06:50,414 --> 00:06:52,976
Adam, pick up
your phone, please.

107
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:54,912
Where are you, son?
Call me.

108
00:09:24,676 --> 00:09:25,919
Django?

109
00:09:30,775 --> 00:09:33,486
Oh, shit! Oh, no!

110
00:09:35,051 --> 00:09:36,247
Hey, I'm sorry, buddy.

111
00:09:36,332 --> 00:09:38,771
Okay.
Okay, here we go.

112
00:09:38,856 --> 00:09:41,138
Here we go, here we go,
come on.

113
00:09:41,223 --> 00:09:43,193
Here we go,
here-here we go.

114
00:09:43,293 --> 00:09:45,197
Okay, there we go.

115
00:10:02,924 --> 00:10:04,084
I saw someone.

116
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:06,677
Amy, he's had seizures
and he could have more.

117
00:10:06,762 --> 00:10:08,529
I've got to get him
to the vet right now.

118
00:10:08,614 --> 00:10:09,475
I saw someone.

119
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,801
A-Amy, please not now.

120
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:12,518
- He was at the house.
- Django's...

121
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:14,643
Well, w-who?

122
00:10:14,728 --> 00:10:18,067
White male,
green Toyota Camry

123
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:20,318
with a horseshoe
in the window.

124
00:10:20,403 --> 00:10:21,576
Horseshoe?

125
00:10:21,661 --> 00:10:23,997
- No, a U shape.
- Yes.

126
00:10:28,371 --> 00:10:30,623
Two fits, definitely.

127
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,264
- There could be more though.
- Right here, Michael.

128
00:10:32,348 --> 00:10:34,013
The last one
was 20 minutes ago.

129
00:10:34,098 --> 00:10:35,708
Here I go, okay.

130
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,013
Okay, here we,
here we go, buddy.

131
00:10:38,098 --> 00:10:39,865
- There we go, there we go.
- Here we go.

132
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,394
Can I get a temperature,
please?

133
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:42,879
- Sure.
- Yeah, is he gonna be okay?

134
00:10:42,964 --> 00:10:44,715
Michael, we got him now.

135
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,049
Oh-oh, yeah, okay.

136
00:10:46,134 --> 00:10:47,599
Hey, buddy, okay.

137
00:10:47,684 --> 00:10:48,841
All right, buddy.

138
00:10:48,926 --> 00:10:50,629
- That's a good boy.
- Okay, after vitals,

139
00:10:50,714 --> 00:10:52,559
we're gonna put him
on oxygen.

You look...

151
00:11:42,848 --> 00:11:44,067
What?

152
00:11:44,277 --> 00:11:46,130
Uh, older.

153
00:11:46,754 --> 00:11:47,880
Mm-hmm.

154
00:11:49,177 --> 00:11:51,532
Yeah, so what are you up to?

155
00:11:51,617 --> 00:11:52,617
What am I up to?

156
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,756
You know, same old stuff.

157
00:11:54,841 --> 00:11:57,177
Lots of drinking
and sleeping around.

158
00:12:00,457 --> 00:12:02,132
Any guy comes near
my little sis...

159
00:12:02,217 --> 00:12:03,732
Who said it's a guy?

160
00:12:07,097 --> 00:12:08,926
Always with the jokes,
right?

161
00:12:18,116 --> 00:12:20,244
People say
revenge doesn't help.

162
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,880
What you did,
the move you made...

163
00:12:26,652 --> 00:12:28,208
it won't bring him back,

164
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:30,942
My heart will never heal.

165
00:12:33,036 --> 00:12:34,817
Do I feel better?

166
00:12:36,927 --> 00:12:38,427
Absolutely.

167
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,232
<i>Hey, son, stay strong.</i>

168
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:14,348
- <i>Ooh!</i>
<i>- Uh, it look like...</i>

169
00:13:15,636 --> 00:13:17,895
It look like it ain't been
in the oven yet.

170
00:13:33,069 --> 00:13:34,802
Little man.

171
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:52,106
Why don't you
explain it to him.

172
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,117
Explain?

173
00:13:57,817 --> 00:14:00,215
How you had it all
under control.

174
00:14:00,598 --> 00:14:03,723
How you was the big man making
all the calls by yourself...

175
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,247
and got his mama and them babies
blown to pieces

176
00:14:07,332 --> 00:14:08,785
in their own fuckin' home.

177
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:17,145
Go ahead, Little Mo,
tell him.

178
00:14:23,301 --> 00:14:25,668
The cop that keeps
the heat off us...

179
00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:30,060
he needed a car to get stole,
so I had to make it get stole...

180
00:14:30,145 --> 00:14:32,053
You didn't need
to do shit.

181
00:14:36,715 --> 00:14:38,809
That's why I pay him
five grand a week.

182
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,246
Now I got this baby
with holes in his heart

183
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:45,550
where his family used to be
and a mob boss motherfucker

184
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:46,784
with a blowtorch.

185
00:14:49,912 --> 00:14:51,426
Now we go to war?

186
00:14:53,379 --> 00:14:54,856
That's your ass.

187
00:15:00,356 --> 00:15:01,801
Follow me.

188
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:20,286
You pay for my mama funeral?

189
00:15:22,934 --> 00:15:24,566
Everybody say
you did.

190
00:15:36,786 --> 00:15:38,955
I ain't never spoken
on this.

191
00:15:40,102 --> 00:15:41,603
Don't tell no one.

192
00:15:41,915 --> 00:15:43,066
You hear?

193
00:15:51,012 --> 00:15:52,629
When my mama died,

194
00:15:52,893 --> 00:15:54,436
she died in her bed.

195
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:56,387
Nobody came.

196
00:15:59,656 --> 00:16:01,027
Only me there.

197
00:16:04,694 --> 00:16:06,535
I was three years old.

198
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,106
Kept her warm
after she dead

199
00:16:11,645 --> 00:16:14,020
with blankets and shit,
but-but...

200
00:16:15,598 --> 00:16:16,926
nobody came.

201
00:16:27,535 --> 00:16:28,949
Something else?

202
00:16:40,146 --> 00:16:41,824
Baxters gotta pay.

203
00:16:48,661 --> 00:16:50,215
They will, little man.

204
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,793
But Big Mo play the long game.

205
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,481
So I need you to get
real patient with some shit.

206
00:17:00,504 --> 00:17:01,838
You do that,

207
00:17:01,923 --> 00:17:03,684
then Desire here
for you.

208
00:17:05,512 --> 00:17:06,559
If not...

209
00:17:10,855 --> 00:17:12,590
you can go
your own way.

210
00:17:56,387 --> 00:17:58,887
Your dad's got stones, bro.

211
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:00,785
Sure.

212
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:03,770
What makes you say that?

213
00:18:05,754 --> 00:18:07,261
The gas leak.

214
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,098
It was a gas leak.

215
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:13,965
Yeah.

216
00:18:15,496 --> 00:18:16,910
It was a gas leak.

217
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:22,660
Yeah.

218
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,020
What's up, prison shit?

219
00:18:35,301 --> 00:18:38,160
Heart-to-heart I had with
that fuck that killed Rocco.

220
00:18:38,627 --> 00:18:40,044
How's his heart?

221
00:18:40,129 --> 00:18:41,527
Stopped.

222
00:18:43,668 --> 00:18:44,965
His head?

223
00:18:46,274 --> 00:18:48,426
Cracked open
like a fucking watermelon.

224
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:52,738
So here's the thing.

225
00:18:56,012 --> 00:18:57,374
Fentanyl cut with heroin.

226
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,082
You tried that shit?

227
00:18:59,568 --> 00:19:00,918
You kidding me, that shit?

228
00:19:01,003 --> 00:19:02,910
It's too beautiful
to even touch.

229
00:19:09,143 --> 00:19:10,721
So, what, are you talking
to someone?

230
00:19:10,806 --> 00:19:13,957
Angola gives its guests
so much more than just Jesus.

231
00:19:17,473 --> 00:19:19,059
Is this a meeting?

232
00:19:28,432 --> 00:19:30,941
Why don't you go spend
some time with your mother?

233
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,949
Hmm?

234
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:46,410
You ain't come here to hunt.

235
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,981
Yo.

236
00:19:55,824 --> 00:19:57,363
All right, little man.

237
00:20:00,348 --> 00:20:02,059
This fell out
of your pocket before.

238
00:20:10,123 --> 00:20:11,918
Or was you just testing me?

239
00:20:14,465 --> 00:20:17,559
<i>♪ You only know me
on the video ♪</i>

240
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:23,215
<i>♪ Now you say
you got a crush on me. ♪</i>

241
00:20:24,013 --> 00:20:26,473
<i>♪ Now you say you got
a crush on me ♪</i>

242
00:21:02,341 --> 00:21:04,772
Hey, the thing with a cluster
of epileptic fits

243
00:21:04,857 --> 00:21:07,708
is that kidney failure
is a real concern.

244
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,601
Right.

245
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,654
It's touch and go, Michael.

246
00:21:14,122 --> 00:21:15,943
We'll do everything
we can for him.

247
00:21:16,411 --> 00:21:17,665
Okay, uh...

248
00:21:20,615 --> 00:21:22,269
Uh, I-I...

249
00:21:22,354 --> 00:21:24,310
I-I need to go now.

250
00:21:25,982 --> 00:21:27,101
We'll call you.

251
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:28,357
Okay.

252
00:22:17,194 --> 00:22:18,257
Hey.

253
00:22:18,913 --> 00:22:20,749
I know you, right?

254
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:23,397
Yeah, uh, maybe, um...

255
00:22:24,263 --> 00:22:27,467
Uh, uh, Rocco's memorial.

256
00:22:28,335 --> 00:22:29,880
I'm his sister.

257
00:22:30,647 --> 00:22:31,797
Right, um...

258
00:22:32,344 --> 00:22:33,554
Hi.

259
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:35,592
What are you doing?

260
00:22:36,725 --> 00:22:38,858
Uh, college interview tomorrow,
so I'm just,

261
00:22:39,077 --> 00:22:41,639
- you know...
- Reading David Foster Wallace.

262
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,358
Of course, the interview scene
at the start.

263
00:22:46,354 --> 00:22:47,689
Where are you applying?

264
00:22:47,898 --> 00:22:49,314
Uh, NYU.

265
00:22:49,555 --> 00:22:50,983
Was that your first choice?

266
00:22:51,514 --> 00:22:52,817
My mom went there.

267
00:22:52,902 --> 00:22:54,772
And she wants you
to repeat her past?

268
00:22:54,857 --> 00:22:56,311
Ah, she's dead, so...

269
00:23:04,636 --> 00:23:05,941
Sorry.

270
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:07,991
Um...

271
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:11,109
So I guess we have
something in common.

272
00:23:11,232 --> 00:23:13,413
Mm-hmm,
death and grief, yeah.

273
00:23:16,538 --> 00:23:18,385
Uh, what-what was he like?

274
00:23:19,007 --> 00:23:20,413
Y-Your brother.

275
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,017
An idiot.

276
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:25,960
Fun.

277
00:23:29,132 --> 00:23:30,132
I'm sorry.

278
00:23:30,217 --> 00:23:31,719
- I shouldn't have asked you...
- No, no, no.

279
00:23:31,803 --> 00:23:34,499
It's, uh...
it's good.

280
00:23:34,592 --> 00:23:37,179
Too many of my friends
have stopped talking to me

281
00:23:37,264 --> 00:23:38,866
'cause they don't know
what to say.

282
00:23:39,731 --> 00:23:41,195
How'd you know Rocco?

283
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,773
I... just met him
once actually.

284
00:23:43,873 --> 00:23:45,405
When? Where?

285
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:49,000
Uh, Tipitina's,
th-that club.

286
00:23:51,155 --> 00:23:52,211
What?

287
00:23:52,296 --> 00:23:54,671
Um... no, uh...

288
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,694
he was wearing my T-shirt

289
00:23:58,007 --> 00:24:01,116
the day he died...
My Tipitina's T-shirt.

290
00:24:03,171 --> 00:24:04,171
Oh.

291
00:24:05,374 --> 00:24:06,414
Uh...

292
00:24:06,499 --> 00:24:08,733
I mean, they told us
he died instantly.

293
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,257
Head injury like that,
he wouldn't have suffered.

294
00:24:13,501 --> 00:24:15,043
I wonder if that's true.

295
00:24:15,652 --> 00:24:18,164
I mean,
what are they gonna say?

296
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,101
You know...
He was in terrible pain?

297
00:24:20,186 --> 00:24:22,483
He... choked on his own blood?

298
00:24:24,538 --> 00:24:26,382
You think they'd tell you
the truth?

299
00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:36,827
I understand.

300
00:24:38,772 --> 00:24:39,925
Do you?

301
00:24:41,725 --> 00:24:44,092
My mom, she was murdered.

302
00:24:44,405 --> 00:24:45,766
Shit.

303
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,014
Yeah, I-I wasn't there,
so...

304
00:24:49,717 --> 00:24:52,195
You know, I think about
her last moments all the time.

305
00:24:52,334 --> 00:24:53,910
What it was like for her.

306
00:24:57,567 --> 00:24:59,862
Um, so I guess

307
00:24:59,947 --> 00:25:02,811
this question matters
even more now that we've...

308
00:25:03,108 --> 00:25:06,483
established that your
dead mom went there, um...

309
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:08,991
is NYU your first choice?

310
00:25:09,295 --> 00:25:11,717
Uh...
yeah, I think so.

311
00:25:11,882 --> 00:25:13,125
I mean, New York seems cool.

312
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,757
And their photography program...

313
00:25:15,842 --> 00:25:17,677
seems cool to...

314
00:25:19,122 --> 00:25:20,764
- I-I guess.
- You guess?

315
00:25:21,108 --> 00:25:23,303
Yeah, no, 'cause you can't
say any of that tomorrow.

316
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:26,905
'Cause you get in anywhere
with that emo vibe.

317
00:25:28,744 --> 00:25:29,991
Sorry.

318
00:25:31,678 --> 00:25:33,452
You know what,
dress rehearsal.

319
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:35,743
You ready?

320
00:25:35,906 --> 00:25:36,906
Oh.

321
00:25:37,124 --> 00:25:38,491
Okay.

322
00:25:40,527 --> 00:25:41,987
I'm, uh...

323
00:25:42,072 --> 00:25:44,241
Professor Big Brain.

324
00:25:45,686 --> 00:25:47,118
I don't know your name.

325
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,046
Adam.

326
00:25:50,139 --> 00:25:51,405
So...

327
00:25:51,663 --> 00:25:54,375
what does a, uh,
a Southern boy like you

328
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,304
who seems to have trouble
remembering his own surname

329
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,178
hope to learn
from attending our...

330
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,717
big-city
New York University?

331
00:26:05,874 --> 00:26:08,945
I hope to gain
the interpersonal skills

332
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:11,500
to finally achieve
some sort of social life.

333
00:26:11,585 --> 00:26:13,468
- Mm-mm.
- Is it something I-I've lacked

334
00:26:13,553 --> 00:26:15,406
during high school
'cause I was too busy

335
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,521
reading books
and taking photographs?

336
00:26:17,606 --> 00:26:20,859
Well, I, uh... I have
to tell you, here at NYU,

337
00:26:20,944 --> 00:26:24,335
we love nerds
without social skills.

338
00:26:24,655 --> 00:26:27,968
Um, what social and political
issues are you passionate about?

339
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,952
Dogs.
An-Anything with dogs.

340
00:26:33,085 --> 00:26:35,592
Hmm.
Um, okay.

341
00:26:36,147 --> 00:26:37,772
Rottweiler or Chihuahua?

342
00:26:37,953 --> 00:26:39,225
Rottweiler.

343
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:41,319
Great Dane or
Newfoundland?

344
00:26:42,007 --> 00:26:43,174
Both.

345
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,764
Ooh. Um...

346
00:26:46,311 --> 00:26:48,637
- Leonberger or sh...
- Oh, Leonberger.

347
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:50,897
Okay.

348
00:26:51,307 --> 00:26:52,749
Um...

349
00:26:53,477 --> 00:26:54,768
one last thing.

350
00:26:54,999 --> 00:26:58,178
Other than the death
of your mother,

351
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,928
tell me about an experience

352
00:27:01,013 --> 00:27:03,098
that's had a big impact
on you recently.

353
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,733
Um...

354
00:27:11,835 --> 00:27:14,831
I-I just met a really
cool girl.

355
00:27:18,147 --> 00:27:20,413
Hmm.
What do you like about her?

356
00:27:20,842 --> 00:27:22,436
She's good at fishing.

357
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,186
You're in.

358
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,983
Hold on.

359
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,594
Help you, lady?

360
00:28:10,342 --> 00:28:14,467
Got blow. Base?
Blues maybe?

361
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,184
I could be a cop.

362
00:28:18,848 --> 00:28:20,264
In this car?

363
00:28:21,015 --> 00:28:22,579
You don't remember me?

364
00:28:23,193 --> 00:28:24,678
I'm Kofi's lawyer.

365
00:28:33,155 --> 00:28:34,368
Kofi dead.

366
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,436
I'm still his lawyer.

367
00:28:41,772 --> 00:28:43,920
You don't think
they're exploiting you?

368
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,863
So you came all this way
just to tell me

369
00:28:48,947 --> 00:28:50,671
I can't take care of myself?

370
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,671
No.

371
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,382
What then?

372
00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:01,761
I want to know
what happened to Kofi.

373
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,867
To do that,
I need a second autopsy.

374
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:06,232
To do that,
I need the signature

375
00:29:06,317 --> 00:29:09,624
of a relative
who's over the age of 18.

376
00:29:11,493 --> 00:29:13,938
You know, you lawyers take
a long time to say shit.

377
00:29:15,863 --> 00:29:17,490
You know
where your father is?

378
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,734
I'm on my own.

379
00:29:23,048 --> 00:29:25,961
Yo, little man, back to work.

380
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,056
You notice how ever since
you came around here

381
00:29:40,141 --> 00:29:41,498
trying to help people,

382
00:29:41,621 --> 00:29:43,726
them same people ended up
dead?

383
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:49,567
Same could be said about you.

384
00:29:50,227 --> 00:29:51,403
Mm-mm.

385
00:29:53,985 --> 00:29:55,580
Where were you raised?

386
00:30:00,844 --> 00:30:02,674
- Garden District.
- Ah. Explains it.

387
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,205
- Explains what?
- I don't know.

388
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,919
Your sense of entitlement,

389
00:30:06,618 --> 00:30:08,157
the way you look.

390
00:30:10,284 --> 00:30:12,102
How you shouldn't be here.

391
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,774
You threatening me?

392
00:30:20,696 --> 00:30:22,219
You done with that, baby?

393
00:30:27,805 --> 00:30:29,307
Oh, you can go now.

394
00:30:30,067 --> 00:30:32,477
- I got this.
<i>- All right now.</i>

395
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,571
Hey.

396
00:30:43,464 --> 00:30:45,090
Thank you for lunch.

397
00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:47,219
Thank him.
He's paying.

398
00:30:48,946 --> 00:30:50,188
Look,

399
00:30:51,602 --> 00:30:55,266
Kofi dad and my dad,
not the same man.

400
00:30:59,527 --> 00:31:01,063
You know where he is?

401
00:31:03,704 --> 00:31:05,100
And his kidneys?

402
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,727
Oh, God.
Please don't let him die.

403
00:31:07,812 --> 00:31:09,102
That dog is...

404
00:31:09,805 --> 00:31:12,651
Please just do everything
that you can.

405
00:31:12,853 --> 00:31:13,900
Thank you.

406
00:31:16,114 --> 00:31:17,290
PWID?

407
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:19,486
Shit was only for
you and Joshua.

408
00:31:19,571 --> 00:31:21,298
Oh, don't matter.
It's still distributing.

409
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:23,103
- But they only had, like...
- No.

410
00:31:23,188 --> 00:31:25,038
It don't matter
if it's commercial.

411
00:31:25,872 --> 00:31:27,352
You're still a dealer.

412
00:31:27,532 --> 00:31:29,419
Well, at least
what the law thinks.

413
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:31,805
Shit.

414
00:31:33,971 --> 00:31:35,298
Weed?

415
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,265
Huh?
Who's the judge?

416
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:46,011
Who's the judge?

417
00:31:46,422 --> 00:31:48,313
- McCallister.
- Yeah.

418
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:51,727
Anyone
in your family have cancer?

419
00:31:52,891 --> 00:31:54,766
- My grandmama.
- All right.

420
00:31:55,156 --> 00:31:58,126
Judge McCallister's wife died
of breast cancer.

421
00:31:58,211 --> 00:32:00,603
You tell him that you bought
the weed for your grandmother.

422
00:32:00,688 --> 00:32:03,322
You'll still need to bring in
a script of her other pain meds

423
00:32:03,407 --> 00:32:04,978
and records of chemo and...

424
00:32:05,063 --> 00:32:07,563
I mean, she needs something
from the doc.

425
00:32:08,171 --> 00:32:09,610
- Yeah.
- All right.

426
00:32:09,695 --> 00:32:10,780
Cool.

427
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,508
Either of you know
how to trace a burner phone

428
00:32:19,593 --> 00:32:21,063
to where it was purchased?

429
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,110
There we go.

430
00:32:57,859 --> 00:33:00,260
D... A...

431
00:33:00,977 --> 00:33:02,438
Zero.

432
00:33:04,586 --> 00:33:06,149
Oh.

433
00:33:09,082 --> 00:33:10,415
In Algiers.

434
00:33:10,547 --> 00:33:12,564
Where in Algiers?

435
00:33:54,182 --> 00:33:56,578
I didn't invite you
to my hotel.

436
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:02,196
Well, who invited you
to Female Jones's house?

437
00:34:17,086 --> 00:34:19,680
You blew up that house
with her babies inside.

438
00:34:25,216 --> 00:34:26,898
Tragedy in it all:

439
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,101
you did it for nothing.

440
00:34:37,466 --> 00:34:38,926
So...

441
00:34:39,687 --> 00:34:42,359
I come down here to help you
get your facts straight.

442
00:34:45,528 --> 00:34:47,868
Little Mo got a call
to steal that Volvo

443
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:50,219
the day after your son
was kilt.

444
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:56,531
Say what you've come
to say.

445
00:34:57,898 --> 00:35:01,414
Little Mo told Kofi
to steal that car on October 10.

446
00:35:02,336 --> 00:35:04,851
Kofi was arrested
on October 10.

447
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,047
Your son was killed when?

448
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,331
Ninth.

449
00:35:10,534 --> 00:35:11,909
Mm.

450
00:35:12,938 --> 00:35:14,398
So...

451
00:35:15,258 --> 00:35:17,020
I don't know
who killed your son,

452
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,836
but it sure the fuck
wasn't Kofi.

453
00:35:22,031 --> 00:35:23,438
'Cause he was dead

454
00:35:23,523 --> 00:35:26,508
well before Kofi took
that motherfucking car.

455
00:35:37,351 --> 00:35:39,414
Why are you telling me
this now?

456
00:35:40,397 --> 00:35:41,437
Shit.

457
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:44,089
Didn't have reason
to tell you fore now.

458
00:35:45,922 --> 00:35:48,820
And blowing shit up
ain't getting nobody nowhere.

459
00:35:50,178 --> 00:35:51,851
If you want a war...

460
00:35:53,336 --> 00:35:55,015
I can give you a war.

461
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,687
Due diligence.

462
00:35:58,383 --> 00:35:59,522
Who the fuck is that?

463
00:35:59,995 --> 00:36:01,328
Your rabbi?

464
00:36:02,562 --> 00:36:04,969
I need to confirm
what you're telling me.

465
00:36:06,029 --> 00:36:07,258
Oh.

466
00:36:13,187 --> 00:36:14,796
Tell Mr. Diligence...

467
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,265
to confirm the shit out
of this shit

468
00:36:19,116 --> 00:36:20,283
real quick.

469
00:36:34,925 --> 00:36:36,289
Get me Cusack.

470
00:36:52,484 --> 00:36:55,787
I had Kofi every weekend
for a few years.

471
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,101
And then he got
into the game.

472
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:02,344
You know, the truth is,

473
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:04,147
once I had my girls,

474
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:06,758
I just couldn't expose 'em
to that.

475
00:37:07,214 --> 00:37:08,964
He was a good kid.

476
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:12,047
You're either in or you're out.

477
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:15,305
And if you're in,
you're dead.

478
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,330
I got a wife now

479
00:37:17,789 --> 00:37:20,515
and two really
good kids.

480
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,482
I need your consent.

481
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,751
Without it,
I can't get a second autopsy.

482
00:37:29,836 --> 00:37:32,515
The last thing I want to do
is go up against some gang.

483
00:37:33,518 --> 00:37:35,813
That's not how it would be.

484
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,484
Could be, though.

485
00:37:38,725 --> 00:37:40,087
It could be.

486
00:37:40,172 --> 00:37:41,665
You're Kofi's father.

487
00:37:43,582 --> 00:37:45,376
You couldn't help Kofi
when he was alive

488
00:37:45,461 --> 00:37:47,004
because of how things are.

489
00:37:47,751 --> 00:37:49,140
Now he's dead.

490
00:37:49,398 --> 00:37:51,801
You could help change
how things are.

491
00:38:01,284 --> 00:38:02,750
Body's been washed.

492
00:38:02,992 --> 00:38:04,141
Does that mean...?

493
00:38:04,272 --> 00:38:06,618
No. Uh, remnants of DNA
still possible.

494
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:09,422
But the brain's the thing.

495
00:38:10,194 --> 00:38:11,444
Wait, the brain?

496
00:38:11,607 --> 00:38:13,828
The coroner puts it
in a garbage bag

497
00:38:13,913 --> 00:38:15,516
after he's done examining it,

498
00:38:15,733 --> 00:38:18,960
with, uh,
all the other organs.

499
00:38:19,528 --> 00:38:21,704
And then that gets put

500
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:22,931
in the chest cavity...

501
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,187
before it is sewn up.

502
00:38:26,336 --> 00:38:28,750
This is what counts.

503
00:38:29,984 --> 00:38:32,547
This is the story.

504
00:38:37,254 --> 00:38:39,344
Back here, little man!

505
00:38:47,578 --> 00:38:50,526
Finally had a minute
to set you up proper.

506
00:38:52,437 --> 00:38:54,156
No more sleeping bag.

507
00:38:58,115 --> 00:38:59,575
For how long?

508
00:38:59,898 --> 00:39:01,787
Man, as long as you want.

509
00:39:05,148 --> 00:39:07,633
Ain't no need
to be shy about it.

510
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,195
Man, didn't skimp
on the thread count.

511
00:39:12,789 --> 00:39:14,305
Yeah.

512
00:39:19,415 --> 00:39:21,187
Never had
my own room before.

513
00:39:23,666 --> 00:39:24,953
Well...

514
00:39:25,648 --> 00:39:28,101
just keep your head down

515
00:39:28,495 --> 00:39:30,204
and your mind sharp

516
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,695
and your loyalty with us.

517
00:39:35,148 --> 00:39:36,738
We'll take care of you.

518
00:40:14,608 --> 00:40:16,852
When your phone rings
and it's me,

519
00:40:16,937 --> 00:40:18,281
you answer it.

520
00:40:20,383 --> 00:40:21,866
Whatever you're doing,

521
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:23,937
whoever you're with,

522
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:25,945
you pick up.

523
00:40:27,687 --> 00:40:29,086
Where were you?

524
00:40:32,789 --> 00:40:34,337
Cafe.

525
00:40:36,172 --> 00:40:37,633
All day?

526
00:40:39,586 --> 00:40:41,351
Prepping for my interview.

527
00:40:44,281 --> 00:40:45,555
Who were you with?

528
00:40:46,101 --> 00:40:47,226
Dad.

529
00:40:50,547 --> 00:40:52,711
Who were you with?

530
00:40:54,515 --> 00:40:57,125
Nobody.
What happened to Django?

531
00:41:03,031 --> 00:41:05,469
You forgot to give him
his meds.

532
00:41:07,495 --> 00:41:09,164
What happened?

533
00:42:06,513 --> 00:42:07,867
He's here.

534
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:09,841
Bring him in.

535
00:42:19,447 --> 00:42:21,273
What did you find
at Kofi's house?

536
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:27,243
Bloody clothes?

537
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,773
Rocco's phone?

538
00:42:33,223 --> 00:42:34,523
Anything?

539
00:42:37,405 --> 00:42:39,421
Cash. Weed.

540
00:42:40,043 --> 00:42:41,420
Planted?

541
00:42:43,914 --> 00:42:45,571
I don't give a fuck
how you made it look.

542
00:42:45,656 --> 00:42:47,117
I want how it was.

543
00:42:47,249 --> 00:42:49,714
Had Forensics
at the scene?

544
00:42:51,117 --> 00:42:53,984
Jimmy, he was driving the car.

545
00:42:54,219 --> 00:42:55,392
He pled guilty.

546
00:42:55,477 --> 00:42:56,854
He, he confessed.

547
00:42:57,789 --> 00:42:59,183
It's done.

548
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:03,890
What the fuck
is the matter with you?

549
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:06,765
"Done"?

550
00:43:08,547 --> 00:43:10,157
This is my son
we're talking about.

551
00:43:10,242 --> 00:43:12,922
Do not fucking insult me
with police shit.

552
00:43:13,578 --> 00:43:14,998
I want the truth.

553
00:43:25,528 --> 00:43:26,780
What's this?

554
00:43:27,251 --> 00:43:28,614
It's a flash drive.

555
00:43:28,824 --> 00:43:31,434
It's all there.
All the evidence we got.

556
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,864
Is the call on there?

557
00:43:36,606 --> 00:43:38,708
The 911 call.

558
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:44,192
It's on there.

559
00:43:45,153 --> 00:43:46,778
Then I want to hear it.

560
00:43:59,934 --> 00:44:03,106
You're gonna take a huge hit
withdrawing this much cash.

561
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:05,046
The college fund, too.

562
00:44:05,458 --> 00:44:08,676
- You didn't say that.
- No, I did. I told you.

563
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:12,083
- Well, that-that's gonna take a while.
- No, no, i-it can't.

564
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:14,140
I need it now.

565
00:44:15,676 --> 00:44:16,970
This is a bank.

566
00:44:17,387 --> 00:44:18,802
This is the 21st century.

567
00:44:18,887 --> 00:44:21,098
Get my money now.

568
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:25,426
Uh, all right.
I'll be right back.

569
00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:31,004
Shit.

570
00:44:50,594 --> 00:44:52,732
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

571
00:44:52,817 --> 00:44:54,669
I'm afraid
we need 48 hours' notice

572
00:44:54,754 --> 00:44:56,817
before we can release funds
from this account.

573
00:45:09,278 --> 00:45:10,825
Shit.

574
00:45:23,381 --> 00:45:24,617
Gina.

575
00:45:28,695 --> 00:45:30,507
Gina, you okay?

576
00:45:31,405 --> 00:45:32,617
What is this?

577
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,846
This is the 911 operator.

578
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,726
<i>You filled up. Now fuck off.</i>

579
00:45:39,004 --> 00:45:41,336
Just stay on the line.
We'll get you some help.

580
00:45:41,734 --> 00:45:44,171
- This isn't it. - <i>We just need
to work out where you are.</i>

581
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:46,914
- Please, if you can...
- Should be Rocco breathing.

582
00:45:50,072 --> 00:45:52,047
This is the 911 operator.

583
00:45:52,132 --> 00:45:53,811
<i>You filled up. Now fuck off.</i>

584
00:45:54,234 --> 00:45:56,789
<i>Just stay on the line.
We'll get you some help.</i>

585
00:45:56,874 --> 00:45:58,640
We just need to work out
where you are.

586
00:45:58,725 --> 00:46:00,937
<i>Please, if you can...</i>

587
00:46:01,061 --> 00:46:02,985
- They called back.
- What?

588
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:04,656
The operator called back.

589
00:46:05,364 --> 00:46:06,664
While that...

590
00:46:07,132 --> 00:46:09,879
that monster who killed our son
was getting gas.

591
00:46:09,964 --> 00:46:13,007
He killed Rocco,
he drove away,

592
00:46:13,429 --> 00:46:15,178
he stopped for gas.

593
00:46:42,729 --> 00:46:44,399
<i>This is the 911 operator.</i>

594
00:46:44,484 --> 00:46:46,484
<i>You filled up. Now fuck off.</i>

595
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:49,188
Just stay on the line.
We'll get you some help.

596
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:51,707
<i>We just need to work out where
you are</i>.

597
00:46:51,792 --> 00:46:52,937
Jim.

598
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:55,781
Jimmy.

599
00:46:57,562 --> 00:47:01,329
The 911 call came from
a cell tower in Chalmette.

600
00:47:01,484 --> 00:47:03,062
There's three gas stations.

601
00:47:20,851 --> 00:47:22,664
Were you working October ninth?

602
00:47:23,787 --> 00:47:24,955
What day was that?

603
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,332
That's a Wednesday.

604
00:47:26,617 --> 00:47:28,164
I work every weekday.

605
00:47:30,984 --> 00:47:32,506
Have you ever seen this kid?

606
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,765
You're kidding me, right?

607
00:47:37,218 --> 00:47:39,132
What about your
security cameras?

608
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:54,816
<i>Yeah?</i>

609
00:47:55,108 --> 00:47:56,693
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>

610
00:47:57,506 --> 00:48:00,827
Listen, I'm on my way,
but I gotta talk to...

611
00:48:00,912 --> 00:48:02,078
Shit.

612
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:12,349
I did not hang up on you.

613
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:14,850
No, I'm-I'm-I'm doing it,

614
00:48:14,935 --> 00:48:16,960
but I-I... I needed to
tell you something.

615
00:48:17,045 --> 00:48:18,843
<i>- You're out of time, man.</i>
- I can't-I can't hear you.

616
00:48:18,928 --> 00:48:19,780
<i>- Do you hear me?</i>
- Wait-wait a second.

617
00:48:19,865 --> 00:48:22,178
Give me a moment.
Hold on, hold on.

618
00:48:22,295 --> 00:48:25,248
Listen, I don't have
all the money yet.

619
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:26,725
<i>What?</i>

620
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:28,992
I need more time.

621
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:30,755
<i>Well, you're out of time, man.</i>

622
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,084
Get the fuck off me.

623
00:48:32,254 --> 00:48:33,504
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

624
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:36,098
<i>You're out of time.</i>

625
00:48:36,993 --> 00:48:38,661
I don't think you have it.

626
00:48:38,946 --> 00:48:40,450
<i>Have what?</i>

627
00:48:42,153 --> 00:48:44,364
The evidence that you need.

628
00:48:47,878 --> 00:48:50,801
Or the balls
to see this through.

629
00:48:52,761 --> 00:48:54,787
Shitty Camry,
living in Algiers.

630
00:48:54,872 --> 00:48:57,714
I don't know,
I wouldn't back you.

631
00:49:32,028 --> 00:49:33,544
This fella here?

632
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,209
Yeah.

633
00:49:35,293 --> 00:49:36,497
You sure about that?

634
00:49:37,754 --> 00:49:40,934
Loves his Leonard Cohen
and his bourbon.

635
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:53,187
You the guy who's been running
around with his wife?

636
00:49:55,844 --> 00:49:57,489
What are you talking about?

637
00:50:00,307 --> 00:50:01,444
He came here.

638
00:50:01,716 --> 00:50:03,593
Wanted to see
the surveillance video

639
00:50:04,022 --> 00:50:05,772
from my camera.

640
00:50:06,631 --> 00:50:07,966
Said he's looking for the guy

641
00:50:08,051 --> 00:50:09,825
who's been sleeping
with his wife.

642
00:50:11,028 --> 00:50:14,417
You, uh... do you still have
the footage?

643
00:50:15,959 --> 00:50:17,461
Nope.

644
00:50:18,567 --> 00:50:19,714
It got erased.

645
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:21,567
By who?

646
00:50:23,712 --> 00:50:25,700
Dylan Thomas.
This guy right here.

647
00:50:27,176 --> 00:50:30,068
- He deleted the footage?
- Yeah.

4
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:18,916
I-I-I tried to help him,
but I...

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,643
So you-you-you called 911?

6
00:00:22,728 --> 00:00:23,761
I tried to.

7
00:00:23,846 --> 00:00:24,960
- Help.
<i>- Hello?</i>

8
00:00:25,045 --> 00:00:26,627
I drove away.

9
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:29,690
I drove away.

10
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:33,377
Stay here, let me set this up.

11
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,291
The boy you hit is
Jimmy Baxter's son.

12
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,830
Do you understand
what that means?

13
00:00:44,915 --> 00:00:47,877
The head of the most vicious
crime family in this city.

14
00:00:47,962 --> 00:00:51,197
I can keep you safe
if no one ever hears about it.

15
00:00:55,747 --> 00:00:57,143
Whoever you are...

16
00:00:58,103 --> 00:00:59,697
wherever you are...

17
00:01:00,422 --> 00:01:02,072
you will be found.

00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:24,252
Help.

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,150
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

23
00:01:26,235 --> 00:01:27,549
<i>I can barely hear you.</i>

24
00:01:29,147 --> 00:01:31,608
<i>Can you hear me?
Hello?</i>

25
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,542
<i>We're having trouble
working out where you are.</i>

26
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:37,042
<i>If you're in the city,
hit one of the keys on your phone.</i>

27
00:01:37,127 --> 00:01:38,580

28
00:01:39,588 --> 00:01:41,080

<i>Hello?</i>

32
00:02:02,314 --> 00:02:03,612
You look tired.

33
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:06,291
I haven't slept all night.

34
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:10,815
What is it, Michael?

35
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:20,229
It's, um...

36
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:23,533
Robin's car.

37
00:02:23,966 --> 00:02:26,643
I need it to disappear,

38
00:02:26,728 --> 00:02:27,776
Charlie.

39
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:29,463
No questions asked.

40
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,479
But it-it just...

41
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:33,385
can't just be sold.

42
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,470
Uh, it...

43
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:36,234
I mean gone.

44
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,869
It's got to be painful for you.

45
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:48,205
Seeing it there every day.

46
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,458
In the street.

47
00:02:49,654 --> 00:02:51,479
Outside your home.

48
00:02:51,815 --> 00:02:53,565
If you were never
to see it again,

49
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,854
it would be harder
for a day or so.

50
00:02:57,371 --> 00:02:58,900
The absence.

51
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:02,463
And then...

52
00:03:05,203 --> 00:03:06,697
Yeah.

53
00:03:11,088 --> 00:03:13,205
Drop the key behind
the front left wheel.

54
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:15,518
Give me a few hours.

55
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,260
I don't have a brother.

56
00:03:26,516 --> 00:03:28,065
And then again...

57
00:03:29,237 --> 00:03:30,463
I do.

58
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:33,402
Rudy!

59
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:36,690
Charlie Figaro.
Good morning.

60
00:03:36,776 --> 00:03:39,518
Hey, you still acting lieutenant
or the real thing now?

61
00:03:40,278 --> 00:03:41,721
That's great.

62
00:03:42,231 --> 00:03:43,807
Yeah, of course I knew!

63
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,518
Why would I ask about it
and already know the answer?

64
00:03:47,446 --> 00:03:49,119
That's the first law
of politics.

65
00:03:50,478 --> 00:03:52,033
Thing about making lieutenant:

66
00:03:52,118 --> 00:03:53,885
half the work,
twice the pay.

67
00:03:54,403 --> 00:03:55,455
Hey, whoa, whoa,

68
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:58,166
wait until I make you
my new chief of police.

69
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:00,221
Yeah!

70
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:02,158
Hey, um...

71
00:04:03,674 --> 00:04:05,151
I need a favor.

72
00:04:08,478 --> 00:04:09,854
Hey.

73
00:04:10,273 --> 00:04:11,607
Rudy Cunningham.

74
00:04:12,004 --> 00:04:13,380
You alone, Little Mo?

75
00:04:13,527 --> 00:04:14,695
Yeah.

76
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:17,088
Good, listen up.

77
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:30,082
Kofi!

78
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:42,565
What's up with you?

79
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,729
I got a job for you, Kofi.

80
00:04:52,615 --> 00:04:54,533
What is this, Dad?

81
00:04:54,935 --> 00:04:56,893
This is yesterday.

82
00:05:14,598 --> 00:05:15,942
I love you.

83
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:18,878
I always will.

84
00:05:23,132 --> 00:05:25,215
May I have two espressos,

85
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,718
- please?
- Sure.

86
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,418
Oh!
Can I ask you something?

87
00:05:30,315 --> 00:05:33,818
Shotgun homes... you know,
front door to back door,

88
00:05:33,941 --> 00:05:34,941
straight through, right?

89
00:05:35,026 --> 00:05:37,176
I mean, does that...
is that always true?

90
00:05:37,261 --> 00:05:38,396
Sure, I think so.

91
00:05:38,481 --> 00:05:39,481
Why?

92
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:41,359
No, it just doesn't make sense.

93
00:05:41,444 --> 00:05:42,904
What?

94
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:46,458
I'm sorry, no,
it's a, it's a case.

95
00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:49,159
A case, like a trial?

96
00:05:49,497 --> 00:05:50,926
Yeah.

97
00:05:51,335 --> 00:05:53,995
Okay, NOPD

98
00:05:54,111 --> 00:05:57,293
busts a shotgun home
in the lower ninth.

99
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:59,145
Now, the police officer
is standing

100
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,352
at the front door,
says that he saw a woman

101
00:06:02,437 --> 00:06:04,314
in the bathroom hiding drugs.

102
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,345
But the geography doesn't
feel right, does it?

103
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,465
Mm, are you on a jury?

104
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:13,567
Oh, no.

105
00:06:13,652 --> 00:06:14,652
A lawyer?

106
00:06:14,786 --> 00:06:16,497
Uh, no.

107
00:06:16,772 --> 00:06:18,273
Are you a judge?

108
00:06:19,438 --> 00:06:21,075
- Yes.
- Hmm?

109
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,275
Well, you could...

110
00:06:23,703 --> 00:06:26,039
- What?
- No, nothing.

111
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:27,785
Well, wait a minute.

112
00:06:27,897 --> 00:06:29,857
No, you were gonna
say something, go ahead.

113
00:06:29,942 --> 00:06:30,942
Say it.

114
00:06:31,027 --> 00:06:33,738
Well... go and look maybe.

115
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,254
Look at-at what?

116
00:06:36,695 --> 00:06:37,989
At the house.

117
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,950
Is that allowed?

118
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,690
Yes.

119
00:06:43,182 --> 00:06:44,559
Yes.

120
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:47,559
You know, that is a good idea.

121
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:50,293
That is a very good idea.

122
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:52,201
Bottoms up.

123
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,120
Booze or dope?

124
00:07:57,205 --> 00:07:58,973
Dad...
Neither.

125
00:07:59,164 --> 00:08:01,041
- You sure?
- Yeah.

126
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:02,999
That's too bad.

127
00:08:03,084 --> 00:08:04,404
'Cause I only give
money to people

128
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:06,825
if it's for booze or dope.

129
00:08:20,695 --> 00:08:23,223
I want who did this, Cusack.

130
00:08:31,926 --> 00:08:34,129
Yesterday's flowers.

131
00:08:34,998 --> 00:08:38,825
Lay them down and...
say something to her.

132
00:08:39,044 --> 00:08:41,338
- Dad...
- Alibis fall apart, Adam.

133
00:08:41,776 --> 00:08:43,153
I see it all the time.

134
00:08:43,238 --> 00:08:44,906
They almost never hold up.

135
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,478
If you want to give yourself
a fighting chance,

136
00:08:47,562 --> 00:08:49,395
it has to be
very close to true.

137
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,748
Okay, but...
being here, doing this...

138
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,781
Months from now,
if you're ever asked

139
00:08:55,866 --> 00:08:56,866
where you were

140
00:08:56,951 --> 00:08:59,129
or what you were doing
on October 9th,

141
00:09:00,128 --> 00:09:02,497
you'll have the muscle memory
of what you did.

142
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:05,629
You won't have to construct
the lie because you lived it.

143
00:09:05,714 --> 00:09:08,519
But... yesterday was yesterday.

144
00:09:08,604 --> 00:09:12,281
If the vet at the gate
is ever on the stand,

145
00:09:12,366 --> 00:09:14,076
do you think he remembers
the date...

146
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:18,887
or the embarrassing wise-ass
and his embarrassed son?

147
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:22,372
And Norma, the waitress,
she knows what day it was.

148
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:26,114
It was the day Judge Desiato
went down to the Lower Ninth

149
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:30,262
to check whether police officers
can see around corners or not.

150
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:35,926
Today is yesterday.

151
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:39,364
What about the car?

152
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:41,692
It's being taken care of.

153
00:09:42,334 --> 00:09:44,878
What-what do you mean
"taken care of"?

154
00:09:44,963 --> 00:09:46,169
I don't know.

155
00:09:46,676 --> 00:09:47,970
And it's better
that I don't know.

156
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,727
Just like it's better
that you don't know.

157
00:09:49,812 --> 00:09:51,114
And that's the truth.

158
00:09:52,194 --> 00:09:53,833
Now, lay the flowers down

159
00:09:53,924 --> 00:09:55,884
- and say a few words for Mom.
- I can't.

160
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:57,330
Was I sad?

161
00:09:57,415 --> 00:10:01,091
Did I play her favorite songs
and cry my heart out?

162
00:10:01,176 --> 00:10:02,975
If you won't listen to me,
how can I keep you safe?

163
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:04,519
I can't fucking do it, Dad.
Any of this.

164
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:07,064
Yes... you can.

165
00:10:07,444 --> 00:10:08,825
You have to...

166
00:10:10,256 --> 00:10:11,817
and you will.

167
00:10:13,553 --> 00:10:15,145
Or we die.

168
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,724
Now you.

169
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,810
I miss you, Mom.

170
00:10:39,725 --> 00:10:41,177
I really miss you.

171
00:12:08,615 --> 00:12:10,692
- Morning.
- Morning, Judge.

172
00:12:14,864 --> 00:12:17,081
Detective Costello to see you.

173
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,958
Oh.

174
00:12:20,014 --> 00:12:21,325
Thanks.

175
00:12:24,172 --> 00:12:25,172
Judge.

176
00:12:25,257 --> 00:12:26,763
Detective. Hey.

177
00:12:27,048 --> 00:12:29,349
I was downstairs
in section B, so...

178
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:31,770
Great. Well, good to see you.

179
00:12:31,882 --> 00:12:33,592
Please, have a seat.

180
00:12:42,317 --> 00:12:44,941
So, the... the message

181
00:12:45,026 --> 00:12:46,494
that you left at
the station yesterday.

182
00:12:46,578 --> 00:12:48,056
Right. Right.

183
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:51,282
Uh, I was calling to report

184
00:12:51,741 --> 00:12:53,938
the theft of Robin's car.

185
00:12:54,202 --> 00:12:55,912
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.

186
00:12:55,997 --> 00:12:57,622
And I-I wanted it to be you

187
00:12:57,707 --> 00:12:59,751
because I didn't want to
make a big deal out of it.

188
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,501
How do you mean?

189
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,727
Well... this isn't about
a car thief.

190
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,871
This, to me,
is a lot bigger.

191
00:13:10,252 --> 00:13:14,506
See, I-I haven't been able
to bring myself to...

192
00:13:15,014 --> 00:13:18,454
get rid of, well, anything.

193
00:13:19,073 --> 00:13:20,876
I mean, her clothes,

194
00:13:20,961 --> 00:13:22,244
the article she was working on.

195
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:24,998
It's all still there.
Her car.

196
00:13:25,733 --> 00:13:27,661
Ah, her car.

197
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:29,950
Every morning I go out,

198
00:13:30,035 --> 00:13:34,802
and there's her car...
just sitting there.

199
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,443
Like a bruise.

200
00:13:40,537 --> 00:13:41,997
It's funny.

201
00:13:42,508 --> 00:13:45,544
The car thief actually
did me a favor.

202
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:52,513
Can I be straight
with you, Judge?

203
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,308
- Please.
- That's a load of crap.

204
00:13:55,622 --> 00:13:57,285
The anniversary of her death.

205
00:13:57,974 --> 00:13:59,683
I mean, he doesn't know that.
How can he know that?

206
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:02,435
But that's the thing
about crime.

207
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,638
It doesn't give a damn
who it hurts or how or why.

208
00:14:06,451 --> 00:14:07,834
You want me to let it go?

209
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,319
- Wrong cop, wrong woman.
- No, I-I...

210
00:14:09,403 --> 00:14:10,779
Robin's murder.

211
00:14:10,887 --> 00:14:13,946
This robber walks into a store
with a gun.

212
00:14:14,031 --> 00:14:17,068
He doesn't want to kill anybody,
but when he knows he has to,

213
00:14:17,285 --> 00:14:20,998
does he ask if Robin Desiato
has a young son or not?

214
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,826
If she's a good person or not?

215
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:25,711
He doesn't care about her life
when he takes it.

216
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,752
So you know what,
I don't care

217
00:14:27,837 --> 00:14:29,730
what our car thief
didn't have for breakfast

218
00:14:29,815 --> 00:14:31,552
or how fucked up
his childhood was.

219
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:34,099
I am going to find
that piece of shit.

I will shoot you.

Please don't-don't shoot me.
Exactly where I can see them.

243
00:15:55,526 --> 00:15:57,613
- Don't shoot me.
- Move towards the door.

- Okay, okay, okay.

247

00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,698

- No.

Do you have anything in your
pockets that's gonna poke me?

256
00:16:23,588 --> 00:16:24,730
No, I don't. No.

- I didn't do nothing, man.

260
00:16:32,253 --> 00:16:34,088
Uh-huh.

261
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:35,652
Copy that.

262
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:34,064
Jesus, what the fuck?!

263
00:17:34,786 --> 00:17:36,420
Where were you, man?

264
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,662
- What?
- Yesterday.

265
00:17:39,661 --> 00:17:43,206
Um, my dad made me do a ton
of anniversary stuff.

266
00:17:44,127 --> 00:17:47,005
Oh, uh... yeah, your mom.

267
00:17:47,645 --> 00:17:48,980
She was a great lady, your mom.

268
00:17:49,856 --> 00:17:51,473
What'd you like best about her?

269
00:17:51,874 --> 00:17:53,125
Probably her tits.

270
00:17:54,043 --> 00:17:55,169
You're sick.

271
00:17:56,246 --> 00:17:57,342
Next.

272
00:17:57,886 --> 00:17:59,972
Custody. Curtis Glover.

273
00:18:00,057 --> 00:18:01,057
Bench warrant.

274
00:18:01,269 --> 00:18:02,593
All right.

275
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:06,683
Mr. Glover, you were supposed
to be here yesterday.

276
00:18:06,848 --> 00:18:08,182
Where were you?

277
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:10,683
At my grandfather's funeral.

278
00:18:12,637 --> 00:18:14,058
I'm sorry.

279
00:18:14,735 --> 00:18:17,488
- How'd it go?
- He's in the ground.

280
00:18:17,626 --> 00:18:20,196
The least you can hope for
from a funeral.

281
00:18:21,297 --> 00:18:22,766
What cemetery was it?

282
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,311
St. Louis Number One.

283
00:18:25,523 --> 00:18:27,529
So not actually
in the ground.

284
00:18:28,526 --> 00:18:29,526
Huh?

285
00:18:29,912 --> 00:18:32,248
Above-ground internments only
up there.

286
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,333
Figure of speech.

287
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:36,200
Mm-hmm.

288
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:39,706
And what was your
grandfather's name?

289
00:18:41,376 --> 00:18:42,961
I don't remember.

290
00:18:46,442 --> 00:18:49,993
Wait, you don't remember
your own grandfather's name?

291
00:18:50,224 --> 00:18:52,114
Just knowed him as Pops.

292
00:18:53,811 --> 00:18:57,688
Okay, so is Pops
your father's father

293
00:18:57,773 --> 00:18:59,313
or your mother's father?

294
00:19:01,117 --> 00:19:02,285
Father's.

295
00:19:04,348 --> 00:19:06,501
Just a wild guess, then.

296
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,485
His name is the same as yours?

297
00:19:08,884 --> 00:19:11,079
Yeah. That's it.

298
00:19:14,328 --> 00:19:16,392
Nobody called Glover
buried yesterday

299
00:19:16,477 --> 00:19:17,923
in the city of New Orleans.

300
00:19:18,008 --> 00:19:19,593
It was Baton Rouge.

301
00:19:20,212 --> 00:19:21,821
It was Baton Rouge.

302
00:19:23,132 --> 00:19:24,954
Do you want us to check that?

303
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,265
Floppy and greasy,

304
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,727
every time.

305
00:19:37,665 --> 00:19:38,999
You gonna eat that sandwich?

306
00:20:06,008 --> 00:20:07,477
When do I get processed?

307
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:09,811
Who brought you in?

308
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:11,748
Well, they didn't
introduce themselves.

309
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:14,211
Took their badge numbers,
though.

310
00:20:16,807 --> 00:20:18,100
Why would you do that?

311
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:20,169
Come on.

312
00:20:20,311 --> 00:20:21,937
What'd you do?

313
00:20:23,499 --> 00:20:25,084
Bullshit driving thing.

314
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,212
Alleged.

315
00:20:28,997 --> 00:20:29,997
Now...

316
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,264
wouldn't that make a lot
of paperwork for you...

317
00:20:33,212 --> 00:20:36,638
when I make a big-ass complaint
about some racist shit?

318
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,395
All to me running a red light?

319
00:20:41,502 --> 00:20:43,412
Three great
female photographers.

320
00:20:43,497 --> 00:20:45,923
Nan Goldin, Diane Arbus,
Vivian Maier.

321
00:20:46,184 --> 00:20:48,637
Which of the three hides herself
most from her subject?

322
00:20:48,722 --> 00:20:50,557
Speaking about great tits, huh?

323
00:20:50,644 --> 00:20:52,449
Something to share, boys?

324
00:20:53,414 --> 00:20:55,176
Come on.
Don't be shy.

325
00:20:58,042 --> 00:20:59,919
Vivian Maier had a box Kodak,

326
00:21:00,521 --> 00:21:03,733
so she held it here, like this,

327
00:21:04,402 --> 00:21:07,671
uh, which kind of
alters the relationship

328
00:21:07,756 --> 00:21:08,827
with the subject.

329
00:21:08,912 --> 00:21:11,266
I mean, the photographer isn't
holding a camera up to her face,

330
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,030
so she's actually looking
at the subject.

331
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:18,328
Not through a lens,
not through anything.

332
00:21:18,873 --> 00:21:23,544
And if the subject sees her,
then he can look back.

333
00:21:25,435 --> 00:21:28,195
Yeah, she was a true
street photographer.

334
00:21:30,466 --> 00:21:31,934
I love Vivian Maier.

335
00:21:34,874 --> 00:21:39,130
I mean, I...
I-I really love her.

336
00:21:51,903 --> 00:21:53,282
You like baseball?

337
00:21:53,433 --> 00:21:55,278
Sure. Why?

338
00:21:55,989 --> 00:21:58,287
Take a look at my possessions.

339
00:22:12,741 --> 00:22:14,200
Mariano Rivera.

340
00:22:14,647 --> 00:22:16,036
Mm-hmm.

341
00:22:16,561 --> 00:22:17,937
How'd you get this?

342
00:22:18,177 --> 00:22:19,528
Do you care?

343
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,398
Desiato.

344
00:22:27,483 --> 00:22:28,786
We found the car.

345
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,645
Hello?
Judge?

346
00:22:33,823 --> 00:22:35,122
Yes, I'm here, I'm here.

347
00:22:35,207 --> 00:22:36,872
Um, sorry.

348
00:22:38,494 --> 00:22:40,919
Well,
that's-that's great news.

349
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:42,833
Where was it?

350
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,348
Headed down Washington.

351
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,083
It-it was being driven?

352
00:22:46,168 --> 00:22:47,545
Mm. Yes.

353
00:22:47,728 --> 00:22:49,397
You want to come pick it up?

354
00:22:49,964 --> 00:22:52,967
Now? Uh...

355
00:22:53,467 --> 00:22:56,062
Yes. Yes.
Now would be great.

356
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,977
- Are you in court?
- No, no, no.

357
00:22:58,062 --> 00:23:00,057
I-I have the time.
I-I'll be right there.

358
00:23:37,845 --> 00:23:38,845
Hi.

359
00:23:39,305 --> 00:23:40,648
It smells like dog.

360
00:23:41,093 --> 00:23:44,538
Uh, yeah. Ten years of Django.

361
00:23:44,773 --> 00:23:48,563
- Mm.
- But seems like only last week

362
00:23:48,648 --> 00:23:50,314
we brought him home
for the first time.

363
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:53,651
- In this?
- Yeah. Yeah.

364
00:23:53,736 --> 00:23:56,360
I was just talking
about it yesterday.

365
00:23:56,684 --> 00:24:01,085
H-He... he peed all over
Adam's lap on the way home.

366
00:24:01,327 --> 00:24:02,494
And you know what he said?

367
00:24:02,578 --> 00:24:04,149
He said it was
"the best day of my life."

368
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:07,791
Said it then or yesterday?

369
00:24:08,484 --> 00:24:09,919
Both.

370
00:24:10,051 --> 00:24:12,312
In the car ten years ago and...

371
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:15,194
again yesterday at the cemetery.

372
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,812
The kid's GPS.

373
00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:22,265
On his phone,
it was set to the scrapyard.

374
00:24:23,092 --> 00:24:27,788
Made me wonder if... this could
be connected to Robin.

375
00:24:28,064 --> 00:24:29,270
Her murder.

376
00:24:29,421 --> 00:24:30,937
Get rid of her car.

377
00:24:31,732 --> 00:24:33,960
But a year later.
Why wait a year?

378
00:24:34,104 --> 00:24:36,019
Like a message.

379
00:24:36,715 --> 00:24:38,130
O-On the anniversary, I mean.

380
00:24:38,215 --> 00:24:40,433
It's a hell of a coincidence
otherwise.

381
00:24:43,746 --> 00:24:44,951
- Judge...
- I'm sorry.

382
00:24:45,036 --> 00:24:46,378
No, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

383
00:24:46,463 --> 00:24:48,245
- I...
- No, it's-it's...

384
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,832
I-I'm okay.

385
00:24:49,917 --> 00:24:51,034
I'm good.

386
00:24:53,921 --> 00:24:56,547
- We're gonna need a statement.
- Sure.

387
00:24:56,847 --> 00:24:58,434
"I'm the registered owner
of the car,

388
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:00,883
- the last time I saw it was..."
- Mm. Yes, I know, Nancy.

389
00:25:02,096 --> 00:25:03,800
Sorry. Stupid.

390
00:25:03,885 --> 00:25:05,839
No, it's-it's okay.

391
00:25:07,396 --> 00:25:09,198
First time you called me
"Nancy."

392
00:25:12,314 --> 00:25:14,144
Really? I...

393
00:25:15,651 --> 00:25:18,074
We could do the statement now,
if you want,

394
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,464
'cause you're here.

395
00:25:19,565 --> 00:25:21,003
Uh, well...

396
00:25:21,088 --> 00:25:22,192
- Uh...
- Y-You know what?

397
00:25:22,277 --> 00:25:25,269
- Another time is fine.
- Okay. Fine.

398
00:25:27,762 --> 00:25:29,128
So...

399
00:25:30,582 --> 00:25:33,910
do you have a, a name for him?

400
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,417
The kid who stole the car?

401
00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:39,176
Oh, um,
well, not with me.

402
00:25:39,261 --> 00:25:41,383
You want me to get it
to you when I have it?

403
00:25:41,468 --> 00:25:43,082
- Well, okay.
- Okay.

404
00:25:48,475 --> 00:25:49,902
How old is he?

405
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:56,081
Young. 17.

406
00:26:02,136 --> 00:26:04,159
I have a confession to make.

407
00:26:07,403 --> 00:26:08,654
I...

408
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:12,742
I don't know
how to say this...

409
00:26:12,827 --> 00:26:14,232
Then just say it.

410
00:26:16,143 --> 00:26:17,506
You can tell me.

411
00:26:23,505 --> 00:26:27,770
I used to drive out of the city
for trail runs

412
00:26:27,855 --> 00:26:29,315
and-and...

413
00:26:30,178 --> 00:26:33,256
So as I... not to have to carry
the car keys with me

414
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,464
while I was running, I...

415
00:26:36,002 --> 00:26:40,404
I got into the habit of leaving
them on top of the tire.

416
00:26:42,076 --> 00:26:45,370
And... it's what I do
all the time now with this car.

417
00:26:45,653 --> 00:26:46,821
Yeah.

418
00:26:46,913 --> 00:26:49,034
We were wondering
how he got the keys.

419
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,855
- Mm.
- I thought, you know,

420
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,163
he might have even
been in your home.

421
00:26:52,247 --> 00:26:55,261
Oh, no. I-I don't, uh...

422
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:57,410
Yeah, sorry.

423
00:26:57,636 --> 00:27:00,401
Well, it might be a problem
with the insurance claim.

424
00:27:01,352 --> 00:27:02,464
Oh, well.

425
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:05,143
What tire did you put
the key on?

426
00:27:05,448 --> 00:27:07,331
Uh, left-front.

427
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,386
Was this always like this?

428
00:27:12,194 --> 00:27:13,608
Oh.

429
00:27:13,756 --> 00:27:17,521
Well, that's hard to say,
with a car this old.

430
00:27:17,707 --> 00:27:19,167
Who drove it last?

431
00:27:20,315 --> 00:27:21,854
Probably Adam.

432
00:27:24,257 --> 00:27:26,893
So, he knew about the,
the key thing?

433
00:27:26,995 --> 00:27:28,479
He did that, too?

434
00:27:29,866 --> 00:27:33,908
Y-Yes. It-it just became
what we did with this car.

435
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:36,050
It's stupid, I know.

436
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:39,347
Hmm. Unlucky, too,
that he spotted it.

437
00:27:41,463 --> 00:27:42,800
The kid.

438
00:27:43,464 --> 00:27:45,379
Oh, right. I guess.

439
00:27:46,323 --> 00:27:49,343
Well, I'm gonna need
a statement from Adam, too.

440
00:27:49,648 --> 00:27:52,181
"The last time I drove the
car wa..." Anyway, you know.

441
00:27:52,266 --> 00:27:54,016
Um...

442
00:27:54,101 --> 00:27:56,262
You know what,
why don't I go check in

443
00:27:56,347 --> 00:27:58,307
- and see where Andy's at?
- Okay.

444
00:28:04,653 --> 00:28:06,253
Fuck.

445
00:28:36,386 --> 00:28:38,565
There were traces of blood
on the inhaler.

446
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:43,838
Well, whose blood?

447
00:28:46,528 --> 00:28:48,182
- Aye.
- Hmm.

448
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,964
Rocco's blood.

449
00:28:56,663 --> 00:28:58,245
Anything else?

450
00:28:58,524 --> 00:29:01,136
We're having the inhaler tested
for DNA.

451
00:29:03,814 --> 00:29:04,940
How long?

452
00:29:05,117 --> 00:29:07,276
We'll go to Cusack
with any results

453
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:09,932
so he can look at the police
database for a match.

454
00:29:10,017 --> 00:29:11,101
How long?

455
00:29:11,324 --> 00:29:12,737
36 hours.

456
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:15,485
This bird.

457
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:19,659
- What's that?
- Cleans itself

458
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:21,689
every ten minutes.

459
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:29,589
Like it fucking matters.

460
00:29:30,072 --> 00:29:32,456
Like anything
fucking matters anymore.

461
00:29:43,685 --> 00:29:45,597
Just need your autograph on this

462
00:29:45,682 --> 00:29:47,043
and you're good to go.

463
00:29:47,378 --> 00:29:48,784
Okay.

464
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:50,229
Thank you.

465
00:30:12,072 --> 00:30:14,636
Whoa. What the hell is that?

466
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:47,159
Cusack.

467
00:31:37,491 --> 00:31:39,131
You remember me?

468
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:45,881
I deal with thousands of cases.

469
00:31:46,147 --> 00:31:48,287
- I...
- The underwear guy.

470
00:31:51,171 --> 00:31:53,686
- Right.
- You don't remember?

471
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:58,892
Remind me.

472
00:31:58,977 --> 00:32:00,182
The defense was,

473
00:32:00,267 --> 00:32:02,654
"I'm not stealing underwear
from clotheslines

474
00:32:02,739 --> 00:32:03,944
'cause I'm a pervert.

475
00:32:04,244 --> 00:32:07,811
I'm cleaning up the city
by removing ugly undergarments

476
00:32:07,896 --> 00:32:09,436
from public view."

477
00:32:09,613 --> 00:32:12,100
Yeah. Yeah,
I remember now.

478
00:32:12,567 --> 00:32:14,272
You found him not guilty.

479
00:32:15,842 --> 00:32:18,153
His name was Arnold Thewlis.

480
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:21,927
Went on to rape three women
and a 14-year-old girl.

481
00:32:22,515 --> 00:32:25,996
Stuffed underwear
in their mouths to shut 'em up

482
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,233
while he did
what he did.

483
00:32:31,265 --> 00:32:32,811
You didn't know that?

484
00:32:36,459 --> 00:32:38,389
I thought
you would have known that.

485
00:32:41,513 --> 00:32:44,248
You try a case
on the evidence.

486
00:32:44,865 --> 00:32:47,748
You can't judge a man on what
you fear he might become.

487
00:32:53,285 --> 00:32:55,576
Fucking traffic.

488
00:34:14,481 --> 00:34:15,699
Sorry. I-I'm so sorry.

489
00:34:15,995 --> 00:34:20,630
Listen, uh, uh,
our car was, uh, stolen.

490
00:34:20,715 --> 00:34:23,363
They got it back,
but, uh, apparently,

491
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:26,176
it was, uh, involved
in a hit-and-run.

492
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:29,701
Uh, so they-they have to
keep it for evidential reasons.

493
00:34:29,786 --> 00:34:30,991
- Right?
- Yeah.

494
00:34:31,075 --> 00:34:34,785
Yeah. And this officer
gave me a ride home.

495
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:36,863
This officer needs to pee.

496
00:34:37,196 --> 00:34:41,426
Right. Uh... it's the third
door on the right.

497
00:34:56,382 --> 00:34:57,382
Dad.

498
00:34:57,467 --> 00:34:58,467
Just...

499
00:35:19,921 --> 00:35:22,758
So you drive that old beater?

500
00:35:23,545 --> 00:35:26,383
Oh, uh, no, it...
it was my mom's.

501
00:35:30,932 --> 00:35:34,625
Uh, so, thank you again.

502
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:37,033
Appreciate it.

503
00:35:48,008 --> 00:35:49,489
Where we going?

504
00:35:51,231 --> 00:35:52,578
Somebody speak?

505
00:35:52,663 --> 00:35:54,369
I don't think so.

506
00:36:14,849 --> 00:36:15,975
Shit.

507
00:36:41,453 --> 00:36:43,577
- Got it?
- Got it.

508
00:37:03,011 --> 00:37:06,016
Why did you say that
you don't drive the car?

509
00:37:07,278 --> 00:37:08,613
I-I thought it would be better.

510
00:37:08,697 --> 00:37:10,758
Well, maybe he
and Nancy Costello won't...

511
00:37:10,843 --> 00:37:12,697
Django!

512
00:37:12,784 --> 00:37:14,368
Knock it off.

513
00:37:15,704 --> 00:37:17,814
You said the car
had been taken care of.

514
00:37:17,899 --> 00:37:18,994
I thought it had.

515
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:20,510
Well, was it abandoned?

516
00:37:21,062 --> 00:37:22,149
No.

517
00:37:22,242 --> 00:37:24,555
Wait, some-someone
was driving it? Who?

518
00:37:24,686 --> 00:37:26,555
I don't know, and we
haven't got time for this.

519
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,500
Dad, do-do they think...

520
00:37:27,585 --> 00:37:30,543
We haven't got time for this!

521
00:37:30,762 --> 00:37:33,470
His blood on your hands.

522
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,642
Your fingerprints in his blood

523
00:37:35,727 --> 00:37:38,399
on the car door handle,
on the steering wheel,

524
00:37:38,484 --> 00:37:39,689
on the rear view mirror.

525
00:37:39,774 --> 00:37:40,857
Please make it stop.

526
00:37:40,942 --> 00:37:42,236
What do you think
I'm doing here?!

527
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,194
With every fucking ounce
of my being, I...

528
00:37:48,536 --> 00:37:50,493
Adam, Adam.
Adam, Adam, Adam.

529
00:37:51,197 --> 00:37:52,531
It's all right, it's okay.

530
00:37:52,615 --> 00:37:54,412
Where's your inhaler?
Huh?

531
00:37:54,703 --> 00:37:55,897
Where's...

532
00:37:56,036 --> 00:37:57,523
Hold on. Hold on.

533
00:38:01,166 --> 00:38:02,272
Here we go.

534
00:38:02,357 --> 00:38:05,272
Okay, sit up, sit up.
There we go, there we go.

535
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,610
Okay.

536
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,522
I have to know.

537
00:38:15,579 --> 00:38:16,913
Okay.

538
00:38:16,998 --> 00:38:20,264
After the accident,
when you were driving home,

539
00:38:20,385 --> 00:38:22,248
did anyone see you?

540
00:38:24,785 --> 00:38:26,762
Uh, the windshield.

541
00:38:27,958 --> 00:38:29,160
What?

542
00:38:29,652 --> 00:38:32,395
Uh, a homeless guy.
He-he washed the windshield.

543
00:38:32,816 --> 00:38:34,262
Okay.

544
00:38:35,176 --> 00:38:36,957
Okay. Um...

545
00:38:37,911 --> 00:38:39,784
What-what kind of homeless?

546
00:38:39,869 --> 00:38:41,629
Fucked up?

547
00:38:42,217 --> 00:38:43,343
Yeah.

548
00:38:43,882 --> 00:38:47,863
Okay, good. Is that it?

549
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,238
I-I stopped for gas...

550
00:38:52,425 --> 00:38:54,090
You stopped for gas?

551
00:38:54,175 --> 00:38:56,613
- I-I-I had to, Dad.
- Christ, Adam!

552
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:04,927
Did you speak to anyone there?
Did anyone see you?

553
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:06,755
Just the guy in the car
behind me.

554
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,980
Wait-wait, what...
what-what guy was this?

555
00:39:09,065 --> 00:39:10,400
Did you... You spoke to him?

556
00:39:10,485 --> 00:39:12,380
N-No. He-he was
just pissed at me

557
00:39:12,465 --> 00:39:15,255
because I-I was slow
and I dropped the pump handle.

558
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,361
And he honked at me.

559
00:39:16,449 --> 00:39:19,652
Adam, did he get
a good look at you?

560
00:39:28,027 --> 00:39:29,671
Shit.

561
00:39:31,883 --> 00:39:32,883
I'm sorry.

562
00:39:32,976 --> 00:39:37,363
No, it's... it's okay.
It's okay, it's...

563
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,104
One more question.

564
00:39:50,316 --> 00:39:51,277
I-I-I can't...

565
00:39:51,362 --> 00:39:54,598
No, I need to ask this.
I need to ask.

566
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:59,197
At the scene,
after the accident,

567
00:39:59,499 --> 00:40:01,074
when you couldn't breathe...

568
00:40:02,226 --> 00:40:04,074
did you find your inhaler?

569
00:40:06,207 --> 00:40:08,277
- Yeah.
- And you used it?

570
00:40:13,339 --> 00:40:14,848
Where is it now?

571
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,591
Go.

572
00:40:42,045 --> 00:40:44,297
Go. Fuck.

573
00:43:16,397 --> 00:43:18,084
We both know you did this.

574
00:43:19,803 --> 00:43:22,115
You can tell me what
I want to know now,

575
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,111
or you can tell me later.

576
00:43:26,069 --> 00:43:27,483
The other way.

577
00:43:29,963 --> 00:43:31,589
Where's the phone?

578
00:43:31,759 --> 00:43:33,615
What phone?

579
00:43:36,501 --> 00:43:38,404
I don't know what
you're talking about.

580
00:43:42,446 --> 00:43:44,022
It's always the same.

581
00:43:44,545 --> 00:43:46,162
I've seen it so many times.

582
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:51,990
That relief, when you confess.

583
00:43:53,757 --> 00:43:55,365
It's like finding God.

584
00:44:05,523 --> 00:44:06,975
Okay.

585
00:44:08,782 --> 00:44:10,256
The other way.

586
00:45:18,811 --> 00:45:20,381
Hey!

587
00:45:30,074 --> 00:45:31,365
Oh...

588
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,468
Want to talk to me now?

589
00:46:58,950 --> 00:46:59,950
Hello?

590
00:47:00,035 --> 00:47:02,170
<i>Adam. Nancy Costello.</i>

591
00:47:02,425 --> 00:47:04,048
Sorry to call so late.

592
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:05,291
<i>Is your dad there?</i>

593
00:47:05,376 --> 00:47:06,959
Uh, he's out running.

594
00:47:07,044 --> 00:47:10,272
Okay. Um, could you
give him a message for me?

595
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:13,397
It's a name.
Do you want to write it down?

596
00:47:22,977 --> 00:47:23,893
NOPD!

597
00:47:23,978 --> 00:47:25,559
- Run!
- Don't fucking move!

598
00:47:25,758 --> 00:47:28,140
Put your fucking hands up,

599
00:47:28,225 --> 00:47:29,193
- ma'am!
- Don't shoot, don't shoot.

600
00:47:29,278 --> 00:47:30,833
- I got kids.
- Put your fucking hands up!

601
00:47:30,917 --> 00:47:32,540
Don't you fucking move.

602
00:47:32,625 --> 00:47:34,694
Keep those hands up.

603
00:47:36,003 --> 00:47:38,147
Clear for entry, Lieutenant.

604
00:47:38,451 --> 00:47:39,856
Don't you fucking move, ma'am.

605
00:47:44,881 --> 00:47:46,171
Where's the phone?

606
00:47:46,372 --> 00:47:48,246
What-what phone?

607
00:47:48,753 --> 00:47:51,586
The phone your fucking son stole
from the boy he ran over.

608
00:47:52,048 --> 00:47:55,514
I don't know
what you're talking about.

609
00:48:04,717 --> 00:48:06,280
Kofi Jones.

610
00:48:06,365 --> 00:48:07,827
What?

611
00:48:09,758 --> 00:48:11,301
Who?

612
00:48:12,193 --> 00:48:14,569
He knocked Rocco Baxter
off his motorcycle

613
00:48:14,654 --> 00:48:17,038
and left him bleeding to death
on the roadside.

614
00:48:17,657 --> 00:48:20,874
And now he's been arrested and
he's gonna pay for what he did.

615
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,506
Penny for them?

616
00:49:33,065 --> 00:49:34,256
Lee.

617
00:49:34,506 --> 00:49:36,360
Judge.

618
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:38,553
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, you, too.

619
00:49:38,638 --> 00:49:40,944
- Yeah.
- It's... Yeah.

620
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:46,077
Are you back here, in the swamp?

621
00:49:46,245 --> 00:49:48,204
$80 million dollar fraud trial.

622
00:49:48,289 --> 00:49:49,787
I'm not even getting
my feet wet.

623
00:49:50,295 --> 00:49:52,991
Eighty million is the fraud
or your bill?

624
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:56,895
Uh, would you like to sit down?

625
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,389
Sure.

626
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:06,100
You called me the other day.

627
00:50:06,836 --> 00:50:09,061
Yes. Um...

628
00:50:10,084 --> 00:50:12,041
So...?

629
00:50:12,474 --> 00:50:16,131
I was, uh, thinking maybe,

630
00:50:16,442 --> 00:50:20,928
I don't know, we could go out
for a glass of wine?

631
00:50:55,981 --> 00:50:57,334
Little Mo.

632
00:51:02,349 --> 00:51:03,349
Hello?

633
00:51:03,538 --> 00:51:05,116
<i>What's good, soldier?</i>

634
00:51:05,575 --> 00:51:07,272
Just wanted to let you know

635
00:51:08,361 --> 00:51:12,778
that we're looking out
for your mama and your family.

636
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:15,170
You ain't got to worry
about all that.

637
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:21,334
Take the hit, little man.

638
00:51:22,508 --> 00:51:24,491
Desire got
your back.

639
00:51:27,304 --> 00:51:29,319
What'd I do?
I didn't do nothing.

640
00:51:31,216 --> 00:51:34,381
You want me to plead out
for something that I didn't do?

641
00:51:38,225 --> 00:51:39,430
What if I don't?

642
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,584
Then your mama
and your family...

643
00:51:42,512 --> 00:51:44,272
I don't know.

644
00:51:45,082 --> 00:51:47,444
Maybe then I can't guarantee
they'd be safe.

645
00:51:48,409 --> 00:51:49,709
You heard me?

646
00:51:53,103 --> 00:51:55,038
Stay strong, soldier.

647
00:52:42,379 --> 00:52:44,795
Kofi Jones. Custody.

648
00:52:46,504 --> 00:52:48,262
Come on.

649
00:52:58,479 --> 00:53:00,431
We object to bail, Your Honor.

650
00:53:00,516 --> 00:53:02,481
The accused resisted arrest
and has continued

651
00:53:02,566 --> 00:53:04,433
to be obstructive
in police custody.

652
00:53:04,641 --> 00:53:06,716
The strength of the evidence...
He was arrested driving

653
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,020
the stolen car that we know
hit and killed Rocco Baxter...

654
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:12,856
is, frankly, overwhelming.

655
00:53:12,941 --> 00:53:15,868
All of this means
he's a serious flight risk.

656
00:53:16,209 --> 00:53:18,080
It's worth remembering,
this is a man

657
00:53:18,165 --> 00:53:19,788
that left another human being

658
00:53:19,975 --> 00:53:21,584
dying on the roadside.

659
00:53:22,027 --> 00:53:24,293
If he can do that,
he can sure as hell jump bail.

660
00:53:31,715 --> 00:53:34,047
You affiliated, boy?

661
00:53:38,487 --> 00:53:40,110
Take them off.

662
00:54:10,894 --> 00:54:13,340
Lower back. That's a gang tat.

663
00:54:13,621 --> 00:54:15,769
Desire crew,
if I'm not mistaken.

664
00:54:17,002 --> 00:54:19,605
You're gonna be okay.

665
00:54:39,433 --> 00:54:41,591
To the charge
of vehicular homicide,

666
00:54:41,809 --> 00:54:43,265
how does the accused plead?

667
00:55:03,593 --> 00:55:05,176
Guilty.

668
00:55:06,243 --> 00:55:07,660
What?

669
00:55:11,245 --> 00:55:13,887
Guilty.

670
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:17,754
Let's recess.

671
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:19,488
Back in 30 minutes.

672
00:55:31,298 --> 00:55:33,879
No, no...

673
00:55:40,933 --> 00:55:43,238
Judge! Judge!

674
00:55:43,754 --> 00:55:46,893
Judge, please.
Judge, J-Judge, please.

675
00:55:47,314 --> 00:55:49,359
- Judge, y-you a good man.
- Listen, I'm sorry.

676
00:55:49,608 --> 00:55:51,234
- Judge, Judge, please.
- No, no, listen. No.

677
00:55:51,318 --> 00:55:52,527
- Please help my son.
- No, i-it's not my case.

678
00:55:52,611 --> 00:55:54,176
- I...
- I know, but y-you could talk

679
00:55:54,279 --> 00:55:55,697
- to somebody.
- There's nothing I can do.

680
00:55:55,781 --> 00:55:58,887
- Then you can help.
- Look, I cannot help you!

681
00:56:02,913 --> 00:56:04,289
I'm sorry.

682
00:56:04,938 --> 00:56:07,604
- Please.
- I'm very, I'm very sorry.

683
00:56:11,505 --> 00:56:13,621
It wasn't a hit-and-run.

684
00:56:13,841 --> 00:56:15,255
It was a hit.

685
00:56:15,592 --> 00:56:17,590
There's no other explanation.

686
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,430
Desire are coming for us.

687
00:56:21,515 --> 00:56:22,824
Carlo beating up

688
00:56:22,909 --> 00:56:24,785
one of their soldiers.

689
00:56:26,415 --> 00:56:28,473
They'd kill Rocco for that?

690
00:56:28,772 --> 00:56:30,899
- These people are animals...
- How many times did I tell him?

691
00:56:30,983 --> 00:56:34,858
Hmm? Stay away from all
that open-air street shit.

692
00:56:34,943 --> 00:56:37,150
Fucking needles and shit?
Fucking...

693
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:41,957
needles, fucking guns, fucking
ten-year-olds selling shit.

694
00:56:45,664 --> 00:56:47,660
I'm gonna clean this city up.

695
00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:52,855
I'm gonna make it fucking shine.

696
00:57:02,816 --> 00:57:05,129
Yeah, he's a good soldier.

697
00:57:06,045 --> 00:57:07,668
Yeah, he's not talking.

698
00:57:07,866 --> 00:57:09,534
All right.

699
00:57:18,605 --> 00:57:20,160
Yeah. For Charlie.

700
00:57:20,315 --> 00:57:22,223
Charlie. Rudy.

701
00:57:22,418 --> 00:57:24,207
We're safe.

702
00:57:24,523 --> 00:57:25,847
Okay.

703
00:57:30,334 --> 00:57:32,636
Lee? Lee?

704
00:57:34,021 --> 00:57:37,238
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

705
00:57:37,729 --> 00:57:39,511
Yeah. Uh...

706
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:42,391
I need a favor.

707
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:47,964
He pleaded guilty, so it's only
a matter of the sentencing.

708
00:57:48,049 --> 00:57:49,355
Why him?

709
00:57:49,728 --> 00:57:52,018
Well, we both know
the difference between you

710
00:57:52,103 --> 00:57:53,588
and an overworked
public defender

711
00:57:53,714 --> 00:57:55,629
could be measured in years.

712
00:57:55,714 --> 00:57:58,421
That's not an answer.
Why him?

713
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:00,139
Judge Harris,

714
00:58:00,224 --> 00:58:01,531
- he just humiliated...
- Yeah, I-I heard.

715
00:58:01,615 --> 00:58:03,300
- Yeah, well...
- Wh-Why were you there?

716
00:58:03,408 --> 00:58:05,073
I was curious.

717
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:08,535
It was Robin's car
that he stole.

718
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:11,722
Y-You didn't know that. Yeah.

719
00:58:11,917 --> 00:58:13,290
It's weird, but...

720
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:15,425
So, I-I just wanted
to see the kid

721
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:18,984
and-and I-I know he did
a very bad thing,

722
00:58:19,069 --> 00:58:21,818
but nobody should be
treated like that.

723
00:58:23,762 --> 00:58:29,014
I was ashamed of us,
of this building. It...

724
00:58:30,075 --> 00:58:32,628
I was humiliated
by his humiliation.

725
00:58:32,771 --> 00:58:35,562
And I know
I can't help everybody,

726
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:38,939
but I would like
to help Kofi Jones.

727
00:58:39,486 --> 00:58:42,194
- This isn't easy for me.
- I know.

728
00:58:42,489 --> 00:58:45,043
I know. I was there, I saw.

729
00:58:47,091 --> 00:58:50,113
But you're asking me to do this,
knowing what you know about me.

730
00:58:51,797 --> 00:58:53,402
I just...

731
00:58:54,626 --> 00:58:56,878
think it's the right thing
to do.

732
00:58:57,522 --> 00:59:02,440
And I thought maybe
you might think so, too.

733
00:59:05,168 --> 00:59:07,082
All right.

734
00:59:07,629 --> 00:59:09,183
I'm sorry.

735
00:59:09,647 --> 00:59:12,480
I shouldn't have asked.
I'm... Really.

736
00:59:24,323 --> 00:59:25,855
One condition.

737
00:59:27,288 --> 00:59:29,543
When we have our glass of wine,

738
00:59:30,438 --> 00:59:31,878
no law talk.

739
00:59:35,604 --> 00:59:37,050
Deal.

740
00:59:39,316 --> 00:59:40,636
Thank you.

741
01:01:19,529 --> 01:01:20,919
Adam?

742
01:01:21,305 --> 01:02:21,398

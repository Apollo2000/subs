1
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:05,255
Previously on Your Honor...

2
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:08,717
The boy you hit
is Jimmy Baxter's son.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,095
I can keep you safe
if no one ever hears about it.

4
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,806
Robin's car,
I need it to disappear.

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,808
Drop the key behind
the front left wheel.

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,602
- You alone, Little Mo?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:19,811
Good. Listen up.

8
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,104
Got a job for you, Kofi.

9
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,373
Every morning, there's her car

10
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,399
just sitting there.

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,026
Like a bruise.

12
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,736
You want me to let it go?

13
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:28,862
No. Sorry.

14
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,906
Wrong cop.

15
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:32,991
- Against the wall.
- We found the car.

16
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,410
Well, that's-that's great news.

17
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,539
What the hell is that?

18
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,623
I love Vivian Maier.

19
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,833
Yeah, I-I really love her.

20
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,835
Dark, suspenseful music

21
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,965
You can tell me
what I want to know now

22
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,883
or you can tell me later.

23
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,303
Kofi Jones knocked Rocco Baxter

24
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,889
off his motorcycle
and left him bleeding to death

25
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:58,100
- on the roadside.
- I need a favor.

26
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,661
- Why him?
- We both know the difference

27
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,812
between you
and a public defender.

28
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:02,980
How does the accused plead?

29
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,440
Guilty.

30
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,235
Adam.

31

32
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,881
Ah, the fields are crying out

33
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,593
It's Jubilee

34
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,721
We sold ourselves for love

35
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,056
But now we're free

36
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,685
I'm so sorry for that ghost

37
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,937
I made you be

38
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:48,150
Only one of us was real

39
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,613
And that was me

40
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,618
I heard the snake

41
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,079
Was baffled by his sin

42
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:02,956
He shed his scales

43
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,126
To find the snake within

44
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,047
But born again is born

45
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,758
Without a skin

46
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,551
The poison enters

47
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,512
Into everything

48
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:23,560
And I wish there was
a treaty we could sign

49
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,229
I do not care who takes

50
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,232
This bloody hill

51
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:32,986
I'm angry and I'm tired

52
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,864
All the time

53
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,784
I wish there was a treaty

54
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:42,663
I wish there was a treaty

55
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:46,416
Between your love and mine

56
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:42,264
I've seen you change
the water into wine

57
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:45,308
I've seen you change it

58
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,228
Back to water, too

59
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:52,691
I sit at your table every night

60
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,651
He got better.

61
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,194
I try, but...

62
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:59,114
Closer to the end,

63
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,699
the better his voice.

64
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:01,950
You got that right.

65
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:06,580
Raging against the dying
of the light.

66
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,708
I do not care who takes
this bloody hill...

67
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,960
Who said that?

68
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,962
Somebody said that, right?

69
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,339
I'm tired all the time...

70
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,593
Don't think I've seen you
in here before.

71
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,930
I wish there was a treaty

72
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:28,018
Between your love and mine...

73
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,895
Unhappy ending?

74
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,688
Hmm?

75
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,690
Your marriage?

76
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,443
In the street, it's Jubilee

77
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,863
Two more here.

78
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,865
You got it.

79
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,034
Dylan Thomas.

80
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,286
Leland Munroe.

81
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,455
Good to meet you.

82
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,583
Only one of us was real

83
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,143
Hit him!

84
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,187
What?

85
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,189
Hit him, motherfucker!

86
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,110
Hey! Hey! Hey, come on, stop!

87
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:03,029
- Stop!
- Fucking hit him.

88
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,710
He does that shit every night.

89
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:20,338
He's in your fucking cell,
so you fucking hit him.

90
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,595
I'm gonna lay some truth
on you, Leland.

91
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:30,390
I didn't come here tonight
to drink away my pain.

92
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:34,185
I came to do something about it.

93
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,521
You lost me, Dylan.

94
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,279
I went to your gas station
tonight.

95
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,405
Wait...

96
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,783
I got there
just as you were leaving.

97
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,036
And I followed you here.

98
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,706
You fucking followed me?

99
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,417
Yeah.

100
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,755
My wife is cheating on me.

101
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:04,466
Oh, shit.

102
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,052
And I've suspected it
for a while.

103
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,304
You know,
the little things that...

104
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,222
- I remember.
- Mm.

105
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,933
I remember.

106
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,562
20 years we've been married.

107
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:22,108
And I'm reduced to snooping
around in her fucking purse.

108
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,070
What'd you find?

109
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,448
Prepaid credit card.

110
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,742
So I tracked the charges.

111
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,955
There was a $32 charge
at your gas station.

112
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,541
October 9, 9:30 in the morning.

113
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,044
So she came into my station,

114
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,171
bought some gas, filled up.

115
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:48,468
She didn't have her car
that morning, Leland. I had it.

116
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:53,473
Oh, goddamn.

117
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:58,812
You know what the next charge
was on the credit card?

118
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,480
Hmm?

119
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,399
The Destiny Inn Motel.

120
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,693
Oh, fuck me.

121
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,569
Shit.

122
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,030
That is not a classy place.

123
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,907
Hourly rates.

124
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:14,619
Well, so, she paid
for the motel.

125
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:18,081
She paid for the bastard's gas
at my station.

126
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,501
Do you know
who this piece of shit is?

127
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:25,005
Well, that's where you come in.

128
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:29,426
You can't hide
from us, pin dick.

129
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,137
Any second now... 8:30.

130
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,431
- 8:50.
- N-No. Stop, stop.

131
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,433
Is that him?

132
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,518
- No.
- Huh?

133
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:46,026
You okay, Dylan?

134
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:52,115
You know what it is, you know...

135
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:55,368
You know what I can't take?

136
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,871
What?

137
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,959
- You.
- Huh?

138
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,879
The kindness of strangers and...

139
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,883
It's okay.

140
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,010
You're a good man.

141
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,554
You're a fucking honorable man.

142
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:21,061
Leland, would you give me
a second?

143
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,942
I want to get this over.

144
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,447
Yeah. Sure.

145
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,199
Sure. Yeah.

146
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,336
Soft, somber music

147
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,771
Shit.

148
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,272
Leland.

149
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:51,151
This saved anywhere else
besides the hard drive?

150
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,737
Some server in the sky, maybe?

151
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:58,408
There's only one server
in my sky, Dylan.

152
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,493
That's the big man Himself.

153
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:04,831
Nope. Nope, what you see
is what I got.

154
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,010
Dark, pulsing music

155
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,441
What the fuck are you doing?

156
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,985
I-I'm just...

157
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,071
I don't know.

158
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:40,200
What's your name, son?

159
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,660
Adam.

160
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,748
Desiato.

161
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,002
You're related?

162
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,256
Is that a tough question
somehow?

163
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,884
- He's my dad.
- You know it's not cool

164
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:01,346
taking pictures
of a secure facility, right?

165
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,058
Yeah.

166
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,059
Sorry.

167
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,311
Don't let that
happen again, a'ight?

168
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,743
I'm thinking
probably the last thing you want

169
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:26,287
is a smart lawyer
fucking with you.

170
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:29,374
You made a decision
to plead guilty.

171
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,334
I respect that.

172
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,585
I'm here for one reason only:

173
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,837
to keep
the number of years down.

174
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,131
The sentencing range is
five to 30.

175
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:40,426
There's a hell of a lot
of discretion built in there.

176
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,845
So what's said on your behalf
really matters.

177
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,515
Your early guilty plea helps.

178
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:48,643
Having no criminal record
really helps.

179
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,770
Leaving a kid your own age

180
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,092
bleeding to death in the road...

181
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,357
...and then stealing
the cell phone

182
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,401
he was trying to call 911 on,

183
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,902
not so helpful.

184
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,822
Appearances matter.
It shouldn't but it does.

185
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:04,784
A good haircut
and a clean shave.

186
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,829
And how's that gonna happen?

187
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,457
You've got friends in here.

188
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,421
Little Mo paying for you?

189
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,841
I'm pro bono.

190
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:23,303
There's no such thing
as a free lunch.

191
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,513
Not even in Latin.

192
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,557
Wait. You know Latin?

193
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,850
Lawyer Latin.

194
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,312
Ever since that mean-ass judge
called me "doli incapax"

195
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,439
when I was ten years old.

196
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,898
Too young
to know wrong from right.

197
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,526
- What were you charged with?
- Usual shit.

198
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,571
Skateboarding while Black
or whatever.

199
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,906
Whole courtroom laughing at me.

200
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:47,493
People still call me Dolly
sometimes.

201
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,999
NOLA PD been good to you?

202
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,970
- So what am I looking at?
- We play it straight, ten.

203
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:08,264
- And if we don't?
- I go to the DA.

204
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,891
With what?

205
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,145
There's an urban myth.

206
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,815
Shreveport cops using an old
beater car to put suspects in.

207
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,025
You heard that?

208
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,361
They lock the doors,
hog-tie the poor bastards,

209
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:22,653
then they let in the gas.

210
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,530
- Stop.
- Not a mark on them.

211
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,699
Only thing that shows?

212
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,451
The eyes.

213
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,495
Red, itchy.

214
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,247
Nothing for a smart lawyer
to fuck with.

215
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,500
- Stop!
- Sure.

216
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,878
Urban myth, right?

217
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,426
I ain't changin' my plea.

218
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:49,347
You do what you do,
but I ain't flipping my plea.

219
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,100
It won't ever come to that.

220
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,727
Low, suspenseful music

221
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,526
music grows louder

222
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,596
I'm your boss, Michael.

223
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,973
It's my job to tell you
you look terrible.

224
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,725
You know why you look terrible?

225
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,393
Field trips to the Lower Ninth.

226
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:18,895
Trials that shouldn't be trials.

227
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,731
Probation reports
when nobody needs them.

228
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,083
- Too much justice?
- Oh, don't you get

229
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,817
all moral high ground
with me, Michael.

230
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:27,195
Neither of us has the energy
for that thinned-out

231
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,697
fucking oxygen that
you're living off up there.

232
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,200
It's basic math... we have
an unbelievable case load,

233
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,994
and you are taking too long
to get through your work.

234
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,787
I'm telling you this

235
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,997
because I love you.

236
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,832
Stop clearing your throat,
Sarah, and say it.

237
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,502
A reporter from The Washington
Post called me yesterday

238
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,669
to comment on his story.

239
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,147
- Know what that story's about?
- No.

240
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,715
Murderers and rapists
freed pretrial

241
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,467
because NOLA judges
are backlogged.

242
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,054
Every judge in this building
is about to take a massive hit

243
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,848
so that Michael Desiato
can sleep at night.

244
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,558
We're good to go, Judge.

245
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,229
I'll see you later, Michael.

246
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,689
Well,
thank you for joining us, Judge.

247
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,025
- Don't do it, Warden.
- I thought judges

248
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:09,529
- were supposed to be impartial.
- You are confusing impartiality

249
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,863
with something else.

250
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:13,574
Carlo Baxter is
a vicious, dangerous racist.

251
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:17,411
Those are very loose terms
you're bandying about, Judge.

252
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,997
With respect, those are terms

253
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,167
representing an impartial
description of the truth.

254
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,795
The motion is for Mr. Baxter

255
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,172
to attend his brother's funeral.

256
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,550
We're not asking
for any favors here,

257
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,843
just some
basic human compassion.

258
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,055
Judge, do you have the court
reporter's notes from the trial?

259
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,766
I don't need them.

260
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,102
Baxter's defense was
that he wasn't there,

261
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,689
that it was someone else who
snapped Justin James's spine

262
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,023
and put him in a wheelchair

263
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,068
and then somehow
planted Carlo's DNA

264
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,529
all over the victim
and the scene.

265
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,906
- Is she there?
- Who?

266
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,576
- The mother.
- Mrs. Baxter's present, yes.

267
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,827
- Why?
- Gina Baxter said

268
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,496
that her son was with her
all day.

269
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:03,916
Which makes him and his mother
proven liars.

270
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,209
We object to the tone

271
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,962
and, frankly, the veracity
of her characterization.

272
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,256
- Do you object to proven liars?
- Why don't we get back

273
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,883
to some facts
instead of slinging mud around?

274
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:17,430
Mr. Baxter has been
an exemplary prisoner.

275
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,389
Exemplary.

276
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,891
Now, it would be just cruel
not to let him be

277
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,603
with his family
when they bury his brother.

278
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:24,895
And here's the thing.

279
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,189
There are only two weeks left
on his sentence.

280
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,734
What kind of idiot would he be
to mess things up now?

281
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,236
The kind of idiot
who comes within an inch

282
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,447
of murdering a 15-year-old boy
for no other reason

283
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,033
than he doesn't like
the color of his skin.

284
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,869
The Baxter family is happy
to meet the full cost

285
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,664
of transport and security
for Carlo to attend

286
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,000
his brother's funeral...
If, God willing,

287
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,835
you see fit to grant the motion.

288
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,129
Is that the best you can do,
Mr. Zander?

289
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,758
The old combination punch
of cash and God?

290
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:59,430
I'll retire to make my decision.

291
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,234
Man, what you up on?

292
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:15,071
Possession.
Single wrap of diesel.

293
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,947
- Mm.
- You?

294
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:19,659
Eh, some bullshit shoplifting.

295
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:31,337
Murder.

296
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,301
Okay, killer.

297
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,141
The New York Times,
I'm thinking, would be

298
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,061
- my paper of choice for this.
- For what?

299
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,230
I've been working
at a white-shoe firm

300
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,190
- doing white-collar crime.
- I heard.

301
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:55,653
Fifteen years ago, when I left
the Public Defender's office,

302
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,196
police beat people up,

303
00:19:57,238 --> 00:20:00,616
got what they wanted,
nobody looking or caring.

304
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,452
Now? It doesn't exist, right?

305
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,371
He pleaded guilty.

306
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:08,124
- After he was gassed.
- And he had legal advice.

307
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,959
45 seconds from an exhausted PD.

308
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,379
Advice is advice. It's done.

309
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,050
Seventeen-year-old
who killed mob boss's son

310
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:20,052
faced mock execution

311
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,888
at a New Orleans
Police Department black site.

312
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:25,349
- Headline writes itself.
- So you're telling me

313
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:28,561
this Kofi Jones kid wants to
change his plea to not guilty,

314
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:32,022
and invite the rest of the world
to just watch what happens next?

315
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,150
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

316
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,653
Flipping his plea,
taking on the NOPD

317
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,405
and the Baxter family?

318
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,533
That's got to come from him,
right?

319
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,412
Warden, I wanted to thank you.

320
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,498
For the religious instruction
my son has received.

321
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,168
I know he'll leave here
with a structure for his life

322
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,212
provided by Jesus Christ
and his teachings.

323
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,757
May God bless you.

324
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,013
It's an unconditional gift.

325
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,933
If you grant my son
permission...

326
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,977
if you allow him home

327
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,271
to be with us
when we bury Rocco,

328
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,440
then take the costs out of this.

329
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,567
The remainder is
for the refurbishment

330
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,027
of your beautiful chapel.

331
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,196
And if you don't let him home,

332
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,282
the whole amount is
for the chapel.

333
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,209
Pulsing, atmospheric music

334
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,380
Kofi Jones.

335
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,091
You said he'd go down easy.

336
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,301
That's right.

337
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,596
He's got a lawyer now.

338
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,139
Fancy sister.

339
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:31,642
Big firm.

340
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,980
That's just
some pro bono bullshit.

341
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,024
You know
all the big firms do it.

342
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:40,693
It don't mean nothing.

343
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,862
She's up in the DA's face.

344
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,655
Threatening a trial.

345
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:48,033
Telling him your boy's ready
to flip his plea.

346
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:52,663
I got eyes on him in O.P.P.

347
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,708
Your facts are backwards.

348
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,711
My boy's staying strong.

349
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,715
All right.

350
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,426
Hope so.

351
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:11,640
This is the coolest spot

352
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,309
in the coolest spot
in New Orleans.

353
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:15,936
I suppose y'all think

354
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:18,981
what my man Deandre here
has accomplished

355
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,025
is something to behold.

356
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:23,986
Black-owned business.

357
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,488
Giving back to the community.

358
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,159
Oh, no. See, see, see,
that just a little appetizer.

359
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,871
I'm talking
about Black-owned Gentilly.

360
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,164
St. Roch.

361
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,249
- St. Roch, too.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

362
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:40,085
- Marigny!
- Oh, no, no, no, brother.

363
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,212
That ship done sailed.

364
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:45,090
Garden District.

365
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,484
- They gonna love me, too.
- Yeah, them, too.

366
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:47,968
- Come on in, brother.
- Uh-oh.

367
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,678
- It's all good.
- Hey, all right.

368
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,263
All right. All right.

369
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,849
It's simple, folks.

370
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:57,353
Don't shop where you can't work.

371
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,731
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

372
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:04,151
Do I got to hand out Q-Tips?
What I just say?

373
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:07,905
Don't shop where you can't work.

374
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,698
- Oh, yeah!
- I heard that.

375
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:14,036
I'm punching one-handed
as Congressman.

376
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:16,664
Make me mayor
and see what happens.

377
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,464
Lee Delamere?

378
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,636
Lee Delamere?

379
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:33,430
What the hell you thinking,
Michael?

380
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,140
She'll get the case tossed,

381
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,601
and the whole thing dies,
Charlie.

382
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,728
You sure?

383
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,981
Oh, Jesus Christ.

384
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:43,649
And if she doesn't,

385
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:46,318
you think she's just gonna
up and walk away?

386
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:49,738
She's a Michael Desiato
protégée, for God's sake.

387
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,075
Her next move? She gets the kid
to open up on this,

388
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:55,285
explore his goddamn options.

389
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,204
He starts feeling loquacious.

390
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,391
- She starts digging up shit.
- No, she's looking the DA

391
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:02,292
right in the eye, and my money's
on the DA blinking.

392
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,254
- Now, if-if Kofi walks...
- Your money's on it?

393
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:08,674
What the hell is this,
a night at the fucking casino?

394
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,759
You playing roulette
with my life?

395
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,512
- I've got this, Charlie.
- I don't think you have.

396
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:16,223
What have you gotten me
into here, Michael?

397
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:18,058
- This is a felony.
- I'm sorry. Okay?

398
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,369
- Listen to me.
- No, no, no, no. Michael.

399
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:20,853
- Listen to me.
- Michael. No, no!

400
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,688
Fuck you!

401
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,189
Fuck you.

402
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,659
I'm sorry.

403
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,245
I'm very sorry.

404
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,913
And you're right.

405
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,708
I never should have...

406
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,670
Whatever happens,
I can manage Lee Delamere.

407
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,256
You fucking her?

408
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,674
You better be.

409
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,426
You need to be fucking her
to manage her.

410
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:55,304
Jesus, who are you?
W-Why are you talking like that?

411
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,556
Because you give me no choice.

412
00:25:57,598 --> 00:26:00,642
Because my career
and everything I've worked for

413
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,436
could be over
because my best friend

414
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,189
just threw me
in the fucking deep end.

415
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,357
I got it.

416
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:10,069
I got all of it, Charlie.

417
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,747
They come here to die.

418
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,501
Just drop dead

419
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:29,088
off of the wall once a week.

420
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,299
And always on a Monday.

421
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,470
Just when my man Razim here
is on "clean up the yard" duty.

422
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,223
- Take that.
- Hmm.

423
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,225
Like a gift from heaven.

424
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,611
You know your bid yet?

425
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,615
Nah.

426
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,077
Well...

427
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,663
whatever they hand down,

428
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,082
hearing the number's
gonna settle you.

429
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,291
Hmm.

430
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,961
Till you get there.

431
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,671
Where?

432
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,465
B.B. Rayburn. Wade, maybe.

433
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:16,635
Most likely Angola.

434
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:21,348
Meantime, we got your back.

435
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,975
You feel me?

436
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,310
Little Mo sent me word.

437
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,771
I got you.

438
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:41,118
Wow.

439
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:43,162
These are really good.

440
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:47,374
He's doing great.
He's got such sensitivity

441
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,418
and a real eye for detail.

442
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,545
His mother
would be proud of him.

443
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:53,338
Aw. That's nice.

444
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:55,174
It's what I think.

445
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,843
And very hardworking.

446
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,512
Yeah, he's...

447
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:03,307
he's really got something.

448
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:46,225
When routine bites hard

449
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,436
And ambitions are low

450
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:52,731
And resentment rides high

451
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:56,193
But emotions won't grow

452
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:59,238
And we're changing our ways

453
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,450
Taking different roads

454
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,743
Then love

455
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:09,164
Love will tear us apart again

456
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,540
Love

457
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:14,544
Love will tear us apart

458
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,213
Again

459
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:31,770
Does he seem...
distracted to you?

460
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:33,730
Maybe a little.

461
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:37,109
Anything you could
put your finger on?

462
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:40,529
Slow, suspenseful music

463
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:49,288
I mean, normally,

464
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,832
he would tell me, but...

465
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,294
Is he seeing anyone?

466
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,046
I mean,
does he have a girlfriend?

467
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,300
Did he tell you
that he has a girlfriend?

468
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:08,890
Because

469
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,518
if he didn't, it's not
really appropriate for me to...

470
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,395
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're right. Sorry.

471
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:32,456
What happened to his shoulder?

472
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,125
Oh, yeah. You saw it.

473
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,419
Well, uh, getting better.

474
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,797
We were wrestling.

475
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:43,216
Stupid, I know, but we've
been doing it for years,

476
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,678
and, well, just happened.

477
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,350
Ms. Latimer, I've been meaning
to speak to you.

478
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,854
When his mother died,

479
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,315
I know you stepped in.

480
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:01,318
I know you looked after him.

481
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,487
And that means a lot to me,

482
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,530
and I appreciate that.

483
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,240
So...

484
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:09,409
thank you.

485
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:40,357
So, how'd it go?

486
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,653
There's a word everybody's
been too scared to use.

487
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,571
What's the word?

488
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:49,074
"Torture."

489
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,784
Jesus.

490
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,413
Okay.

491
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,581
- Okay.
- He thought

492
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,250
they were gonna kill him.

493
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,170
Well, you can't just stand up
in court and say,

494
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,506
"Your Honor,
my client's been tortured.

495
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,258
Please reduce his sentence."

496
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,761
I mean, Harris is 100% pro-cop.

497
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:13,348
He spends half his drinking life
drinking with cops,

498
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,599
so he's not gonna let anyone

499
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:17,602
assert anything like that
in his own courtroom

500
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:19,187
without backing it up.

501
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,273
So, evidence.

502
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,442
What have you got?

503
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:26,445
Okay, so...

504
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,655
where does that leave you?

505
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:31,908
Well, the judge will hate you
and hate your client

506
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,035
because you're besmirching
the good name

507
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,580
of his drinking buddies
in the NOPD.

508
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,373
So, end result,

509
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,542
possibly more years than less.

510
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:42,627
What... Why are you smiling?

511
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:46,965
I remember how you used to test
my arguments

512
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,925
by taking the other side

513
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,844
and arguing
the hell out of things.

514
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,345
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh-huh.

515
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:56,391
You know, of all the clerks
over all the years,

516
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:57,934
I got to say...

517
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:00,812
- Don't embarrass me.
- Were in the top four.

518
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,856
- Five.
- Four?

519
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:07,110
- Yeah. Well...
- Thanks.

520
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,946
Okay. So,

521
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,491
how are you going to win?

522
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:18,121
The DA is in his office
right now

523
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:21,166
asking himself
one of those questions

524
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:24,294
that comes along roughly once
in the career

525
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,795
of a man like him.

526
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:29,966
Does he want a police brutality
scandal in the city,

527
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,719
or would he prefer it went away?

528
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,930
And the only way
he can make it go away

529
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,682
is if he drops the charges.

530
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,772
Slow, somber music

531
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,699
- Southpaw.
- What?

532
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,535
Thanks.

533
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:59,204
All right, just a couple more.

534
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:04,709
Left-handed.
You've never heard that before?

535
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,211
No.

536
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,216
- Uh...
- One more.

537
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,593
- Hey.
- Hey. Uh...

538
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:15,428
She's gonna need yours, too.

539
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:17,847
Forensics.

540
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:22,227
So I can eliminate
your prints from the car.

541
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:25,730
Yeah.

542
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:28,858
We can do the, uh,
witness statements now, too.

543
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:30,860
One-stop police work.

544
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,280
The world needs more cops
like you.

545
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:36,616
Never been easy
around flattery, Judge.

546
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,827
Makes me think
somebody wants something.

547
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,537
That's what I like about you.

548
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,247
There you go again.

549
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:45,625
Listen, uh,
would you be breaking any rules

550
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,502
if I offered you a beer?

551
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:49,796
Well, only if I accepted it.

552
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:54,843
All right, well, I'll tell you
what I'm doing here.

553
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:59,347
I am going to place this bottle
onto the table...

554
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:02,475
...and what happens to it
after that

555
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,311
is not my jurisdiction.

556
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,480
I like your style, Your Honor.

557
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,191
So, technically,

558
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,944
I'm... supposed
to take you separately,

559
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:13,862
but...

560
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,614
you know.

561
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,532
So, um...

562
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:20,785
the date the car was stolen.

563
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:23,413
October 9.

564
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,206
And...

565
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,917
where was it parked?
Who drove it last?

566
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:30,170
Um...

567
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,547
You know, truth is,
I don't remember.

568
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:33,798
Do you?

569
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,386
Yeah,
people don't remember stuff.

570
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:40,847
I mean, unless they...
have a reason to.

571
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,450
I... Put a gun to my head,
I couldn't swear

572
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,517
I locked the front door
this morning.

573
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,605
I-I lied.

574
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,106
Sorry?

575
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,359
What do you... what do you mean?

576
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:53,485
Uh, t-to the cop.

577
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,321
Uh, the one who drove Dad home
from the impound.

578
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:59,991
I-I told him
I'd never driven Mom's car.

579
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,326
But I-I do drive it.

580
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,869
I mean...

581
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,330
I-I did drive it.

582
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:09,501
Why'd you lie to him?

583
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,712
Uh...

584
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:14,255
B-Because, um...

585
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,925
I used to drive it
when I was underage.

586
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:20,387
At 15.
Which is pretty illegal, I know.

587
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,932
A-And Dad being a judge and all,
I just...

588
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,601
When the cop asked me
if I drove it,

589
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:29,437
that popped into my head, and...

590
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:30,689
I lied to him.

591
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,232
I rode shotgun.

592
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:36,611
Nighttime loops around
the Superdome parking lot.

593
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,124
I think
the statute of limitations

594
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,959
has run out on that, Adam.

595
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,794
But... your dad,

596
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,088
I'm not so sure,
being a judge and all.

597
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,423
Mea culpa.

598
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,551
Uh, Latin for "I'm sorry"?

599
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:03,555
No. Latin for "my fault."

600
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,098
All right.

601
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,642
If you want
to take a look at these.

602
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,147
One job.

603
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:15,525
One fucking job.

604
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:20,238
Keep his family safe.

605
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,198
Boss.

606
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:25,535
I bought him the bike, Frank.

607
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:29,164
Wasn't the bike that killed him.

608
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,750
Tell that to Gina.

609
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,002
It was Desire payback.

610
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,629
For... a fight?

611
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:39,007
The kid was Desire-affiliated.

612
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,509
Part of the benefits package.

613
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:42,510
You get beat down,

614
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:45,597
they make sure
the other guy gets it worse.

615
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,140
It wasn't a fight.

616
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,600
Carlo kicked the shit
out of him.

617
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:52,145
But why would they wait all
this time to come back at us?

618
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:55,774
Fuck knows
how these people think.

619
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,942
What I do know is...

620
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,986
that if we do nothing,

621
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,780
we look weak.

622
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,115
They came for us,

623
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:06,284
we take it to them.

624
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:08,828
That's how it goes.

625
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,791
Then where does it end?

626
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,960
We go big.

627
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:21,591
We go big once,

628
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:24,302
and that ends it.

629
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:27,806
Soft, ominous music

630
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,849
She's pretty great.

631
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:32,310
You know?

632
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:36,314
Ms. Latimer.

633
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:47,784
Don't you think?

634
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,916
Hey.

635
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,251
Mom's Leica.

636
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,504
What about it?

637
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:02,966
I think it's terrific
that you're using it.

638
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,677
And I-I agree with Ms. Latimer.

639
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,846
Stop calling her that.

640
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,973
Well, it's her name.

641
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:12,642
She lets us call her
by her first name.

642
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:15,019
Which is...?

643
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,729
Frannie.

644
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:18,273
Frannie. Okay.

645
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,149
Frannie. I agree with Frannie.

646
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,111
I think your mom
would be very proud of you.

647
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,196
Don't do that.

648
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:27,782
Don't do what?

649
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,326
Act like everything is normal.

650
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,453
W... Like where I'm gonna go
to college

651
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,455
and how I'm doing
in school matters.

652
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,332
Of course it matters, Adam.

653
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,417
Please, just...

654
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,627
can you not go down this road?

655
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:40,670
I-I have to.

656
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,214
I mean, I-I have to, 'cause
you're not listening to me, Dad.

657
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,383
I mean...

658
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:48,511
Do you know
what day it is tomorrow?

659
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:49,679
Yeah.

660
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,014
It's Saturday.

661
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,056
Yeah, Saturday.

662
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,433
And life will go on,

663
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,310
and Saturday will be Saturday,

664
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,062
except that they
are burying Rocco Baxter, Dad.

665
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,064
Should I just pretend
that isn't happening?

666
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,066
Yes!

667
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,568
Yes!

668
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:07,530
That's what you do.

669
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:11,034
You have to move on.

670
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,912
Fuck.

671
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:42,440
He will be here.

672
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:46,611
I'm not burying my son
without my son.

673
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:51,616
Mom.

674
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:55,745
Slow, percussive music

675
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,650
Please rise.

676
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:31,614
O God,

677
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:34,993
by whose mercy
the faithful departed find rest,

678
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:39,622
bless this grave, and send your
holy angel to watch over it.

679
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:42,458
As we bury here
the body of our brother,

680
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,503
deliver his soul
from every bond of sin,

681
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:49,465
that he may rejoice in you
with your saints forever.

682
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,051
Through Christ our Lord.

683
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:53,720
Amen.

684
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,222
To you, O Lord,
we commend the soul

685
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:58,141
of Rocco, your servant;

686
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:01,185
in the sight of this world
he is now dead;

687
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:04,439
in your sight
he may live forever.

688
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:07,567
Forgive whatever sins he
committed through human weakness

689
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:11,029
and in your goodness
grant him everlasting peace.

690
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,989
Through Christ our Lord.

691
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,993
O God, by whose mercy
the faithful departed

692
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,077
find rest...

693
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,620
...bless this grave,

694
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:22,457
and send your holy angel
to watch over it.

695
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,508
As we bury here
the body of our brother,

696
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,261
deliver his soul
from every bond of sin,

697
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:39,223
that he may rejoice in you
with your saints forever.

698
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,017
Through Christ our Lord.

699
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,561
Amen.

700
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,521
To you, O Lord,

701
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:47,365
we commend the soul of Rocco,
your servant...

702
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,817
In the sight of this world

703
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:51,611
he is now dead.

704
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:54,530
In your sight,
he may live forever.

705
00:42:55,823 --> 00:43:01,245
Forgive whatever sins he
committed through human weakness

706
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:04,123
and in your goodness grant him
everlasting peace.

707
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:05,333
Through Christ our Lord.

708
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,005
Shit.

709
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,343
Merciful Lord,

710
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,595
you know the anguish
of the sorrowful;

711
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:20,723
you are attentive
to the prayers of the humble.

712
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:25,561
Hear your people who cry out
in their need.

713
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:32,068
Ma'am, we've got to keep
at least 25 yards.

714
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,736
I'm his mother.

715
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,281
And his mother.

716
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,991
Let me hold my son.

717
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:40,827
Ma'am. Please.

718
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,304
If you don't move back,
we're gonna have

719
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,955
to take Mr. Baxter away.

720
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,875
My boy.

721
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,502
That's my boy.

722
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:50,771
- Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to...
- Don't touch her.

723
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:53,965
Don't you put your hands on me.

724
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,969
You have mothers.

725
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,804
Hmm?

726
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:03,266
You all have mothers.

727
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:05,494
- Royce here.
- Uh, yes, sir.

728
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:06,871
Calling from the PD's office.

729
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:09,665
Ah, got you clerking
on the weekends, huh?

730
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,375
Yes, sir. Anyway, we noticed

731
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:14,086
that you've got a prisoner
headed your way.

732
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:15,504
Well, son of a bitch!

733
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,840
Uh, you get
an aggressive defense...

734
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:20,968
- What happened?
- Oh.

735
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,888
Yeah, hang on.

736
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,057
No, I don't have
any transfers today.

737
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,059
Well, it-it...

738
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,268
must be last minute.

739
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:30,853
Got himself
a compassionate release.

740
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:33,105
Anyway,
he's headed your way now.

741
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:36,484
What the fuck is that?!

742
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:39,528
All right, the name is Baxter.

743
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:43,449
- What?
- Carlo Baxter.

744
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,869
Will you do us a favor
and move...

745
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:51,415
uh, Jones, Kofi Jones,
into protective custody?

746
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:54,377
Oh, yeah, he's the
hit-and-run perp, right?

747
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:57,421
Yeah, uh, he has to be separated

748
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,715
until Baxter goes back
to Angola.

749
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:02,426
I got it. We'll "keep away" him.

750
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:05,513
Good, good. Great.

751
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:08,474
Uh, that name again is
"Kofi Jones."

752
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:11,269
And thank you, Sheriff.

753
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:17,608
Damn!

754
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,423
It's Carlo Baxter.

755
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:19,003
What?

756
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:22,882
The sentencing hearing.

757
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,845
What about it?

758
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:30,848
The DA is coming.

759
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:35,561
Robinson, in person.

760
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:38,356
He blinked, Michael.

761
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:40,941
They're dropping the charges.

762
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:43,194
- Oh, my God.
- We did it.

763
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:44,570
You did it.

764
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:47,907
Kofi goes free in the morning.

765
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:07,510
Jones, let's go.

766
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:10,012
What for?

767
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:11,472
The infirmary. Intake physical.

768
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,557
They stripped me down
when I got here.

769
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,601
Looked up every hole.
What else they want with me?

770
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:17,228
Your sheet says
"intake physical,"

771
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,563
so away we fucking go.

772
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,359
Somber, haunting music

773
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:03,626
Hey!

774
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,503
Hey! Hey! Hey!

775
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:06,837
Hey! Stop!

776
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:09,298
Stop!

777
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,800
Suspenseful music

778
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:51,257
What's going on in here?

779
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:54,260
They're trying to kill me!

780
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,179
Kid's crazy as a shit-house rat.

781
00:50:57,221 --> 00:51:00,391
We're just doing our jobs here.

782
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,396
Come back later.

783
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:47,896
These are amazing.

784
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:51,358
- You wanted honest.
- Yes.

785
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,861
Are these honest?

786
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:56,572
Absolutely.

787
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:01,660
'Cause I'm a good liar.

788
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:04,496
Adam...

789
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:10,169
You know why
my shoulder's like it is?

790
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,715
I hit someone.

791
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:17,384
- You got in a fight?
- With my car. I...

792
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:19,678
- Wait. You...
- Shut up. Shut up. Please.

793
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,930
- Let me do this.
- Adam...

794
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:23,474
I can't know this.

795
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:25,976
You can't tell me this,
because if you do...

796
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:27,770
That kid,
the one that got killed...

797
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,521
- No, Adam...
- It was me.

798
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:33,817
I was driving... I... and I had
a stupid asthma attack, and...

799
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,402
and I couldn't breathe,

800
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:38,280
and I dropped
my stupid inhaler, and...

801
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:46,538
And he was making
this gurgling... sound.

802
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:49,375
My shoulder was all fucked up,
and I...

803
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:51,085
He was alive?

804
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,629
He-he was, but then he just...

805
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:58,133
His eyes just went... you know?

806
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:02,179
I was looking at him,
and he-he just couldn't...

807
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,936
He couldn't hang on.

808
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:11,522
And I left him.

809
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,778
I left him there.

810
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,947
Slow, haunting music

811
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,576
There's all different kinds

812
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,328
of juice in this world.

813
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,080
There's the juice we got in here

814
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:30,791
for getting small shit done.

815
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,711
There's the juice
you need out on the streets.

816
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:37,339
And then, there's Baxter juice.

817
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:40,801
That shit plays everywhere.

818
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:42,094
Inside, outside.

819
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,221
And it plays
on both sides of the law.

820
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:47,141
You can't go up
against that juice and win.

821
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:50,561
Not you, not me, not Desire.

822
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:56,900
So what do I do?

823
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:11,582
You tell me why I shouldn't be
in a cage or a fucking coffin.

824
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,543

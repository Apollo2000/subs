-Wait. I can't know this.

00:00:07,389 --> 00:00:08,766
That kid,
the one that got killed?

5
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:10,184
-No. Adam.
-It was me.

[Frankie]
It wasn't a hit-and-run.

00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:14,647
It was a hit.
Desire are coming for us.

Kofi Jones knocked Rocco Baxter

11
00:00:21,904 --> 00:00:24,073
off his motorcycle
and left him bleeding

12
00:00:24,156 --> 00:00:25,282
to death on the roadside.

13
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:27,785
-How does the accused plead?
-Guilty.

14
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:28,911
He's not talking.

15
00:00:28,994 --> 00:00:31,539
-All right. We're safe.
-Okay.

16
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,790
I can't help everybody,

17
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:34,875
but I would like to help
Kofi Jones.

Yes!

Carlo Baxter is a vicious,

dangerous racist.

32
00:00:59,316 --> 00:01:01,902
It would be cruel not to let him
be with his family

33
00:01:01,944 --> 00:01:03,737
when they bury his brother.

34
00:01:03,821 --> 00:01:04,905
Will you do us a favor

35
00:01:04,947 --> 00:01:07,116
and move Kofi Jones?

36
00:01:07,157 --> 00:01:08,409
He has to be separated.

I don't know.

That's not what Mom said.

Do you know what the consent
decree is, Mr. Baxter?

77
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,183
We allow one of our inmates
to be killed

78
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:45,435
at the hands of another,
and the federal government

79
00:05:45,477 --> 00:05:47,938
can come right on in here
and take over.

District of Columbia.

Yeah.
There's no homicides in my jail.

you go on back to Angola

and serve out the remainder
of your sentence.

87
00:06:09,793 --> 00:06:12,880
And this never happened.

Today he's dead.
What happened, Royce?

Oh, you back working
for the working man?

98

I thought you moved
to greener pastures.

-He's my client.
-And when I say "working man,"

100
00:06:55,255 --> 00:06:57,883
in this instance,
I mean "drug-dealing man."

101
00:06:57,925 --> 00:07:00,928
Why would that be the first
thing you want to say to me?

102
00:07:01,428 --> 00:07:03,263
Yeah, I'm kind of busy,
Lee, so...

[clears throat]

00:07:10,103 --> 00:07:13,273
Looks like some sort of trauma.

105
00:07:13,982 --> 00:07:15,984
Was he on suicide watch?

106
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,362
Oh, yeah, you and suicide.

107
00:07:18,403 --> 00:07:20,197
You have that little thing.

108

Don't you fucking dare.

Look, I told you what I know.

Don't start getting creative.

111
00:07:27,496 --> 00:07:31,333
So he didn't do it to himself.

112
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,210
All I can give you
is what I got.

113
00:07:33,251 --> 00:07:35,295
A dead kid. It's a tragedy.

114
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:38,131
We're getting
to the bottom of it.

115
00:07:39,758 --> 00:07:43,762
Yeah, fine. You want to do
something for your client?

116

Jones's intake property.

About what?

121
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,622
Whatever you're feeling.

122
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:15,627
You said it didn't have
anything to do with us.

123
00:08:18,422 --> 00:08:20,048
I-I don't want to be late
for school, Dad.

124

brain swell is putting
pressure on the skull,

No puncture wounds, so...

00:09:48,428 --> 00:09:51,640
looks like someone
beat the crap out of him.

Well, that's sure a headline
I don't like.

Do you think, do you think
it was the Baxters?

Killed him?

00:12:11,738 --> 00:12:15,200
What-what do you want us
to do, Michael, huh?

167
00:12:15,242 --> 00:12:16,117
Go to the cops?

168
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,786
-Is that what you're saying?
-No, I--

169
00:12:17,827 --> 00:12:21,414
'Cause otherwise this is
all just a bunch of hot air.

Fuck!

00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,252
Sometimes you just...

172
00:12:25,293 --> 00:12:26,586
take my breath away.

173
00:12:26,628 --> 00:12:29,589
I'll tell you exactly
what takes my breath away.

174
00:12:29,673 --> 00:12:33,134
I'll tell what damn near
stops me breathing every day.

always photographing it?

-I win this election...
-Jesus.

178

I'll make the Lower Ninth Ward

179

This is not about
your fucking election!

181

This is about your conscience!

182
00:12:49,985 --> 00:12:53,446
I had no more of an idea of
the consequences than you did.

183

You asked me a favor.

I didn't say no.

We're all diminished.

You want to take your conscience
down to the police station

190

and check it in,
well, hey, go ahead.

bringing me down with you

-Falling for her

could get in the way
of you paying attention

You just...

You have to be very careful

there's no choice.

And sometimes...

there are truths

What are they doing?

00:23:11,772 --> 00:23:16,569
So that we can
help you know your own mind.

334
00:23:19,071 --> 00:23:21,574
This is New Orleans, Jimmy.

335
00:23:21,616 --> 00:23:23,075
Everything connects.

336
00:23:23,117 --> 00:23:26,120
Everybody connects.

337
00:23:26,704 --> 00:23:28,039
The graves are above ground

338
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,585
so the dead can hear what's
being whispered about them.

339
00:23:34,545 --> 00:23:36,505
We have stoops
in front of our houses

340
00:23:36,547 --> 00:23:40,509
so that what passes
down the street

341
00:23:40,593 --> 00:23:42,470
can be heard,

342
00:23:42,511 --> 00:23:47,058
This is the easiest town
in the world

343
00:23:47,141 --> 00:23:49,769
to send a message.

344
00:23:51,354 --> 00:23:55,358
The one thing you can't do

345
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:58,069
is nothing.

346
00:24:01,656 --> 00:24:04,116
The city is waiting.

347
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:10,164
What is Jimmy Baxter gonna do?

348
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:15,503
[birds chirping]

349
00:24:18,214 --> 00:24:19,840
[siren wails in distance]

350
00:24:21,842 --> 00:24:23,886
Let me see that right quick,
youngin?

351
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,681
[dogs barking in distance]

352
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:52,331
How's your mama?

353
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:58,170
[Eugene]
She's all right. You know?

354
00:25:12,226 --> 00:25:14,729
A little lagniappe.

355
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,108
You know what that is?

356
00:25:19,191 --> 00:25:22,069
[train horn blows in distance]

357
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:23,529
[chuckles softly]

358
00:25:23,571 --> 00:25:25,489
Read a book, nigga.

359
00:25:25,531 --> 00:25:27,491
Use that money,

360
00:25:27,533 --> 00:25:29,577
get you some new tennis,

361
00:25:29,618 --> 00:25:32,038
some groceries for the fam.

362
00:25:32,121 --> 00:25:34,832
Then I'm-a put you on.

363
00:25:34,874 --> 00:25:37,168
You hear me?

364
00:25:37,251 --> 00:25:39,128
Yeah.

365
00:25:39,211 --> 00:25:41,380
[chuckles softly]

366
00:25:43,966 --> 00:25:45,551
Ole Boy,

367
00:25:45,593 --> 00:25:48,512
you know,
it's a long life out here

368
00:25:48,596 --> 00:25:50,473
for a nigga of few words.

369
00:25:50,514 --> 00:25:52,516
slow, somber music

370
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,363
[engine starts]

371
00:26:08,491 --> 00:26:12,369
So, is Rocco in heaven?

372
00:26:13,662 --> 00:26:16,373
-What kind of question is that?
-Of course he is.

373
00:26:16,415 --> 00:26:18,334
[scoffs softly]

374
00:26:18,375 --> 00:26:20,920
What does it look like?

375
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:24,548
We don't know.

376
00:26:24,632 --> 00:26:27,093
Why don't we know?

377
00:26:27,134 --> 00:26:28,928
I mean, the Koran knows.

378
00:26:29,011 --> 00:26:32,515
Men get a busload of virgins
to hang out with.

379
00:26:32,556 --> 00:26:34,600
You know what Muslim women get?

380
00:26:34,642 --> 00:26:36,644
Their husbands back.

381
00:26:36,685 --> 00:26:39,146
So while the men are busy
with the virgins,

382
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,065
their celestial laundry
gets done

383
00:26:41,148 --> 00:26:42,149
and there's food on the table.

384
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,276
Where is she getting this?

385
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,277
Uh...

386
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,445
[Fia]
She's right here, Mom.

387
00:26:46,529 --> 00:26:47,530
Why don't you ask her?

388
00:26:47,571 --> 00:26:49,156
Where are you getting this?

389
00:26:49,198 --> 00:26:50,407
Confirmation class.

390
00:26:50,449 --> 00:26:51,325
What does that mean?

391
00:26:51,408 --> 00:26:53,035
It's making me think.

392
00:26:53,077 --> 00:26:54,286
Well, don't.

393
00:26:54,328 --> 00:26:55,204
[scoffs]

394
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:56,580
There it is.

395
00:26:56,664 --> 00:26:58,749
You said it.
Stop thinking.

396
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:01,293
Open up your heart
to not thinking.

397
00:27:01,377 --> 00:27:02,878
Is that what you want?

398
00:27:02,962 --> 00:27:06,465
Is that what you want for me?

399
00:27:06,507 --> 00:27:08,467
[scoffs]

400
00:27:10,344 --> 00:27:12,805
[footsteps departing]

401
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,854
You said nothing.

402
00:27:19,895 --> 00:27:22,773
[chuckles softly]
I'll talk to her.

403
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,947
You bought the motorcycle.

404
00:27:29,989 --> 00:27:31,240
He died.

405
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:32,533
You did nothing.

406
00:27:32,575 --> 00:27:35,703
She's turning away from God.

407
00:27:35,744 --> 00:27:37,663
She's killing me,
and you--

408
00:27:37,705 --> 00:27:40,291
I said I'll talk to her.

409
00:27:52,595 --> 00:27:54,972
You okay?

410
00:27:57,266 --> 00:27:59,226
Yeah.

411
00:28:02,563 --> 00:28:04,440
No.
[exhales]

412
00:28:04,523 --> 00:28:06,150
That was dreadful.

413
00:28:06,192 --> 00:28:09,195
I'm so glad you were there.

414
00:28:15,284 --> 00:28:19,205
Let me give you a chance.

415
00:28:19,246 --> 00:28:21,874
To what?

416
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,752
After Robin,

417
00:28:24,793 --> 00:28:28,714
the way...
you and Adam must be--

418
00:28:28,797 --> 00:28:31,508
are...

419
00:28:34,136 --> 00:28:38,098
I'd understand if you...

420
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,935
wouldn't want to do this

421
00:28:40,976 --> 00:28:43,395
with me.

422
00:28:48,025 --> 00:28:50,486
But you need to tell me soon.

423
00:28:50,527 --> 00:28:53,280
Now, really.

424
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:54,782
It's very nearly too late.

425
00:28:54,865 --> 00:28:58,118
Adam has to be the first thing
that I think about.

426
00:28:58,202 --> 00:29:00,746
-Yep.
-Always. I mean, that's a given.

427
00:29:00,829 --> 00:29:03,332
Yeah. Well, I understand.

428
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,459
No. No, no, I...

429
00:29:05,501 --> 00:29:08,963
I-I don't think you do.

430
00:29:13,634 --> 00:29:16,929
You make me happy.

431
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,808
-And that's good for Adam.
-[exhales]

432
00:29:20,891 --> 00:29:22,393
[sniffles]

433
00:29:22,476 --> 00:29:26,063
And what's good for Adam is...

434
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:29,566
Um...

435
00:29:31,235 --> 00:29:31,944
Aw, shit.

436
00:29:32,027 --> 00:29:34,071
I-- This has been so long.

437
00:29:34,113 --> 00:29:36,115
I...

438
00:29:36,782 --> 00:29:39,618
Come to bed.

439
00:29:47,459 --> 00:29:48,919
[indistinct chatter]

440
00:29:48,961 --> 00:29:50,170
You think
if I sent her a dick pic,

441
00:29:50,254 --> 00:29:52,298
I could say
it's part of my portfolio?

442
00:29:52,381 --> 00:29:53,465
What?

443
00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:55,592
I think she'd love it.

444
00:29:55,634 --> 00:29:56,552
Who?

445
00:29:56,593 --> 00:29:57,469
Ms. Frannie,

446
00:29:57,553 --> 00:29:59,263
with my dick in her hand.

447
00:29:59,346 --> 00:30:01,598
-Whoa. What the hell? No.
-Get up. Get up. Get up.

448
00:30:01,682 --> 00:30:03,100
-Get off me, man.
-What the fuck did you say?

449
00:30:03,142 --> 00:30:04,685
-Adam, get off me, man.
-What the fuck did you say?!

450
00:30:04,768 --> 00:30:06,103
-What the fuck?!
-[Frannie] Adam! Hey!

451
00:30:06,145 --> 00:30:08,439
-Fuck did you just say? Fuck!
-Excuse me! Adam!

452
00:30:08,522 --> 00:30:09,815
-Fuck did you say?!
-Adam!

453
00:30:09,898 --> 00:30:12,151
[panting]

454
00:30:22,786 --> 00:30:24,705
[phone ringing in distance]

455
00:30:24,788 --> 00:30:27,333
Adam, what's going on?

456
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:28,876
Nothing.

457
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:31,545
No, it's not nothing.

458
00:30:31,628 --> 00:30:33,589
Ms. Latimer--

459
00:30:33,672 --> 00:30:36,508
-Adam's pickup is here.
-Mr. Armfield.

460
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,384
Senator.

461
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:40,012
[Elizabeth]
Uh, wh...

462
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:43,307
-You okay, Adam?
-Yeah.

463
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:45,267
We have a rule here,

464
00:30:45,351 --> 00:30:50,397
that once violence
has entered into it,

465
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:53,609
then expulsion is mandatory.

466
00:30:53,692 --> 00:30:57,404
And in this case, that is
exactly what has happened--

467
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:58,822
Doughnuts.

468
00:30:58,906 --> 00:31:00,324
What?

469
00:31:00,366 --> 00:31:02,826
My jurisprudence professor
handed 'em out

470
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,036
at the start of class one day.

471
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:06,413
He said
rules are like doughnuts.

472
00:31:06,455 --> 00:31:08,123
They have holes in 'em.

473
00:31:08,207 --> 00:31:11,126
The holes are
where discretion lives.

474
00:31:11,168 --> 00:31:13,670
You've known Adam
since the sixth grade.

475
00:31:13,712 --> 00:31:15,422
You know what he's been through,
what his...

476
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:18,008
family's been through.

477
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:22,930
I don't think one incident
should ruin a young life

478
00:31:23,013 --> 00:31:28,060
just because some rule
tries to say it should.

479
00:31:28,644 --> 00:31:31,563
Do you?

480
00:31:35,984 --> 00:31:38,445
You didn't have
to drive me home.

481
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,322
I don't mind.

482
00:31:40,364 --> 00:31:42,574
I do mind
that I haven't heard from you

483
00:31:42,616 --> 00:31:45,202
or your father in weeks.

484
00:31:45,702 --> 00:31:47,996
The anniversary,
for example.

485
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:51,583
It would have been good
to see you.

486
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:54,711
Be together on the day.

487
00:31:54,795 --> 00:31:57,756
How's your father?

488
00:31:58,841 --> 00:32:00,926
Same.

489
00:32:01,009 --> 00:32:03,345
No. We're not doing that.

490
00:32:03,429 --> 00:32:06,265
You and I do not not talk.

491
00:32:06,348 --> 00:32:09,017
If I ask you how your father is,
I want an answer.

492
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:12,438
You hate him?
He's pissing you off?

493
00:32:12,479 --> 00:32:15,274
He cries every night like I do?

494
00:32:15,315 --> 00:32:16,108
We talk.

495
00:32:16,191 --> 00:32:19,486
"Same"? No,
we're talkers in this family.

496
00:32:19,528 --> 00:32:21,780
So talk.

497
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:25,117
I-I'm sorry.

498
00:32:26,743 --> 00:32:28,787
Dad and I just...

499
00:32:28,871 --> 00:32:32,040
wanted to be together.

500
00:32:32,666 --> 00:32:37,129
We-we went to the cemetery
and laid flowers.

501
00:32:37,171 --> 00:32:41,300
I had the first cup of coffee
I ever liked.

502
00:32:41,884 --> 00:32:44,052
We talked to the Vietnam vet

503
00:32:44,094 --> 00:32:45,721
-by the gate down there.
-Mm-hmm.

504
00:32:45,762 --> 00:32:48,307
Never really noticed him before.

505
00:32:49,766 --> 00:32:52,811
What kind of flowers?

506
00:32:53,687 --> 00:32:55,481
Freesias.

507
00:32:59,109 --> 00:33:01,737
Her favorite.

508
00:33:01,778 --> 00:33:04,448
From the stall by the gate.

509
00:33:04,531 --> 00:33:06,950
-Yeah.
-Mm.

510
00:33:06,992 --> 00:33:08,994
And the coffee?

511
00:33:09,036 --> 00:33:12,539
That Italian place.

512
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:17,336
The best.

513
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,843
Seat belt.

514
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:29,556
Doughnuts.

515
00:33:41,443 --> 00:33:42,945
Your mom--

516
00:33:43,028 --> 00:33:45,864
can you still hear her voice?

517
00:33:47,241 --> 00:33:50,118
Uh, yeah, how she used
to answer the phone

518
00:33:50,202 --> 00:33:54,248
like she was amazed
when somebody called her.

519
00:33:54,289 --> 00:33:55,832
"Hello?"

520
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:59,336
[laughs]
Oh, God. That's right.

521
00:33:59,378 --> 00:34:02,881
"Who could this be calling me?"

522
00:34:06,385 --> 00:34:09,054
Like she wasn't
a wonderful human being

523
00:34:09,096 --> 00:34:10,722
with a million friends.

524
00:34:10,764 --> 00:34:14,434
[sighs]
But where are they now?

525
00:34:16,061 --> 00:34:18,355
And the cops...

526
00:34:18,397 --> 00:34:20,732
There's one.

527
00:34:20,816 --> 00:34:21,817
Which?

528
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,027
I-I mean, she hasn't given up.

529
00:34:24,111 --> 00:34:26,613
Do I know her?
What's her name?

530
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:27,864
Nancy.

531
00:34:27,948 --> 00:34:29,825
N-Nancy Costello.

532
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:32,286
Do you have her number?

533
00:34:33,453 --> 00:34:35,247
Yeah.

534
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,749
Does she like shrimp?

535
00:34:46,925 --> 00:34:48,885
[engine stops]

536
00:34:48,927 --> 00:34:51,430
[crickets chirping]

537
00:34:53,515 --> 00:34:54,808
[sighs]

538
00:34:55,309 --> 00:34:59,396
-[horn honks]
-[whispers] Jesus. God.

539
00:35:05,068 --> 00:35:06,862
Very funny.

540
00:35:06,945 --> 00:35:09,448
Yeah. Very funny.

541
00:35:10,657 --> 00:35:12,034
You know how jumpy I am.

542
00:35:12,075 --> 00:35:14,494
[chuckles]
What do you want me to do?

543
00:35:14,578 --> 00:35:17,789
I want you to wash up
some shrimp.

544
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,125
Ah. Oh.

545
00:35:20,167 --> 00:35:21,668
-Oh.
-Ah!

546
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:22,794
Elizabeth.

547
00:35:22,878 --> 00:35:24,379
Well, I didn't know
you were stopping by.

548
00:35:24,421 --> 00:35:27,924
Well, if I waited for
the Desiato men to invite me,

549
00:35:27,966 --> 00:35:30,969
I'd be in my grave.

550
00:35:31,011 --> 00:35:32,304
Charlie Figaro!

551
00:35:32,387 --> 00:35:34,514
Senator Guthrie,
as I live and breathe.

552
00:35:34,556 --> 00:35:36,141
You look wonderful.

553
00:35:36,183 --> 00:35:38,852
[Elizabeth]
Uh, charm is overrated, Charlie,

554
00:35:38,935 --> 00:35:40,562
except by voters.
Remember to turn it down

555
00:35:40,604 --> 00:35:43,190
-while you're with family.
-[Charlie] Hey there, boy.

556
00:35:43,273 --> 00:35:45,108
-[Adam] Hey, how you doing?
-[Charlie] Good, good.

557
00:35:45,192 --> 00:35:47,110
-Hi.
-[Michael] Oh. Hello.

558
00:35:47,152 --> 00:35:49,112
[Elizabeth]
Uh, Detective Costello and I

559
00:35:49,196 --> 00:35:51,198
-have been having a talk.
-[Michael] Oh, so you...

560
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:52,574
two haven't met before?

561
00:35:52,658 --> 00:35:54,660
[Elizabeth] No, one of the many
communication failures

562
00:35:54,701 --> 00:35:56,286
I'm going to remedy.

563
00:35:56,328 --> 00:35:59,373
Would you like to stay
for dinner, Detective?

564
00:35:59,414 --> 00:36:02,751
Oh, that's-that's so kind. I...

565
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:03,919
Sure. Of course.

566
00:36:04,002 --> 00:36:05,128
[Elizabeth]
Uh, there's, uh, rum punch

567
00:36:05,212 --> 00:36:06,296
on the back porch.

568
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,674
Adam, take Detective Costello
and Charlie

569
00:36:08,715 --> 00:36:10,050
and offer them some.

570
00:36:10,092 --> 00:36:11,718
-Uh, yeah.
-Yeah.

571
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,095
Come on.

572
00:36:13,178 --> 00:36:16,890
Think I'm gonna need something
a little heavier than the punch.

573
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:18,975
[door opens]

574
00:36:19,017 --> 00:36:21,269
-Nancy, how you been?
-Oh, you know, I'm doing okay.

575
00:36:21,311 --> 00:36:23,772
Adam was suspended from school.

576
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:26,066
-What?
-Three days home.

577
00:36:26,108 --> 00:36:28,193
I'll be making sure
it doesn't go on his record.

578
00:36:28,276 --> 00:36:30,362
No, wait, wait.
What happened?

579
00:36:30,404 --> 00:36:33,824
He and Wesley got into a fight.

580
00:36:33,865 --> 00:36:35,158
You're kidding.

581
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,202
No, I-I dropped everything,

582
00:36:37,285 --> 00:36:38,453
brought him home,
cooked for him,

583
00:36:38,495 --> 00:36:40,122
paid attention
to what he was saying

584
00:36:40,205 --> 00:36:42,165
-and not saying any...
-You're a saint, Elizabeth.

585
00:36:42,249 --> 00:36:44,251
-Got it.
-Yeah.

586
00:36:44,334 --> 00:36:47,295
-Why didn't he call me?
-Yeah, wh-why do you think

587
00:36:47,379 --> 00:36:49,256
-he didn't call you?
-I don't know.

588
00:36:49,339 --> 00:36:51,925
-Why don't you know?
-Oh, Jesus Christ. Really?

589
00:36:51,967 --> 00:36:54,970
A fight with Wesley?

590
00:36:55,011 --> 00:36:56,722
I-I mean...

591
00:36:56,805 --> 00:36:59,099
Did he-did he say why?

592
00:36:59,141 --> 00:37:00,142
Yes and no.

593
00:37:00,225 --> 00:37:01,643
What the hell does that mean?

594
00:37:01,685 --> 00:37:05,397
Well, on the surface, uh,
an argument about photography.

595
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:10,026
Underneath, a child boiling up
with a lot of pain and anger.

596
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,529
-[phone ringing]
-[groans] You see?

597
00:37:12,571 --> 00:37:14,573
Bang, in the middle
of a conversation about

598
00:37:14,614 --> 00:37:16,992
your son's suspension
from school for violence,

599
00:37:17,075 --> 00:37:18,285
and you really
want to take that call?

600
00:37:18,368 --> 00:37:19,870
Let me ask you again.
Why do you think

601
00:37:19,911 --> 00:37:22,372
he didn't call you?

602
00:37:23,915 --> 00:37:26,418
I d-I don't...

603
00:37:27,043 --> 00:37:29,963
What-what did...
what did you and-and...

604
00:37:30,046 --> 00:37:33,341
Detective Costello talk about?
Hmm?

605
00:37:33,383 --> 00:37:35,927
[crickets chirping outside]

606
00:37:37,012 --> 00:37:39,264
I was disappointed
you didn't call.

607
00:37:39,306 --> 00:37:41,099
On the anniversary.

608
00:37:41,183 --> 00:37:42,392
But you didn't, so...

609
00:37:42,434 --> 00:37:45,437
at the end of the day,
I went to see her.

610
00:37:46,021 --> 00:37:48,774
No flowers.

611
00:37:48,857 --> 00:37:52,110
No cards. Nothing.

612
00:37:53,153 --> 00:37:54,905
[whispers]
Nothing.

613
00:37:54,946 --> 00:37:59,493
Only a year,
and sh-she's forgotten.

614
00:38:01,328 --> 00:38:02,537
Okay, look, look, what...

615
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:06,082
what does that have to do
with Adam?

616
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:09,419
Oh, well, let-let's ask him.

617
00:38:10,003 --> 00:38:11,087
[Adam]
What?

618
00:38:11,171 --> 00:38:14,049
[Elizabeth] Did you leave
a note for your mom

619
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:15,759
at the grave on the anniversary?

620
00:38:15,801 --> 00:38:18,011
[Adam]
Uh, yeah. A...

621
00:38:18,053 --> 00:38:19,095
a card.

622
00:38:19,137 --> 00:38:23,308
Uh, did you write it
or did your father?

623
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,727
Me. Why?

624
00:38:25,811 --> 00:38:27,896
What'd you write?

625
00:38:27,979 --> 00:38:30,857
"I love you and always will."

626
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:33,151
And you left it there for her?

627
00:38:33,193 --> 00:38:35,654
[Adam]
Yeah.

628
00:38:40,242 --> 00:38:42,285
ominous music

629
00:38:59,052 --> 00:39:01,012
[crickets chirping]

630
00:39:01,054 --> 00:39:03,515
[indistinct chatter]

631
00:39:13,191 --> 00:39:14,985
The soup's cold.

632
00:39:15,735 --> 00:39:17,904
It's gazpacho.

633
00:39:18,572 --> 00:39:22,534
I don't care what it's called.
It's cold.

634
00:39:24,327 --> 00:39:27,873
You want me to heat up
your gazpacho?

635
00:39:53,815 --> 00:39:56,192
[quiet laughing]

636
00:39:56,234 --> 00:39:57,402
Why does she believe you

637
00:39:57,485 --> 00:39:59,529
when you pretend you don't know
what gazpacho is?

638
00:39:59,571 --> 00:40:02,782
My Scottish tenement childhood.

639
00:40:02,866 --> 00:40:03,909
[Jimmy laughs]

640
00:40:03,992 --> 00:40:07,579
Porridge with salt, haggis,
neeps and tatties,

641
00:40:07,621 --> 00:40:09,122
ketchup with everything.

642
00:40:09,205 --> 00:40:11,374
I have come a very long way
to, uh...

643
00:40:11,416 --> 00:40:13,919
soup with ice in it.

644
00:40:19,466 --> 00:40:21,343
Your mother wanted me
to talk to you.

645
00:40:21,426 --> 00:40:24,763
Dad, I got to tell you,
that's a pretty weak opening.

646
00:40:24,846 --> 00:40:26,097
What?

647
00:40:26,139 --> 00:40:28,141
Confessing to being
only the messenger.

648
00:40:28,224 --> 00:40:30,435
Your confirmation. Mom says...

649
00:40:30,477 --> 00:40:32,103
There you go again.

650
00:40:33,605 --> 00:40:36,942
Why not just decide to believe?

651
00:40:36,983 --> 00:40:38,151
Believe in God,

652
00:40:38,234 --> 00:40:40,070
the all-powerful,
narcissistic cynic?

653
00:40:40,153 --> 00:40:42,364
I'm not even sure
I like him, Dad.

654
00:40:42,447 --> 00:40:45,241
-Fia, ca--
-Dad, what do you want me to do?

655
00:40:45,283 --> 00:40:48,662
This god, who knows everything
and decides everything

656
00:40:48,703 --> 00:40:50,622
and a week ago woke up
and thought, "Oh, I know,

657
00:40:50,705 --> 00:40:52,290
let's kill a 17-year-old boy
in New Orleans

658
00:40:52,374 --> 00:40:54,626
just for the hell of it"--
I have to love him?

659
00:40:54,709 --> 00:40:57,045
Don't-don't-don't
do this to her.

660
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:58,254
-Not now.
-Do you love him?

661
00:40:58,338 --> 00:40:59,589
-It's not the right time.
-Dad, I'm jus...

662
00:40:59,631 --> 00:41:04,135
Just do what I fucking say!

663
00:41:23,405 --> 00:41:25,407
I'm, like, trying to get
a little bit more specific

664
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:28,451
on the girl
and who and when and wh...

665
00:41:28,535 --> 00:41:29,661
When-when was it?

666
00:41:29,703 --> 00:41:31,871
-Eighth grade.
-Eighth grade?

667
00:41:31,955 --> 00:41:34,499
Eighth grade.
Jennifer St. George.

668
00:41:34,582 --> 00:41:36,626
Oh, my God. Jennifer.

669
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:38,670
-Mm.
-[chuckles] She was--

670
00:41:38,753 --> 00:41:41,089
-Worth fighting for.
-First and only fight.

671
00:41:41,172 --> 00:41:43,216
-[Nancy] Mm.
-Who won?

672
00:41:43,258 --> 00:41:45,051
-Who do you think?
-Who do you think?

673
00:41:45,093 --> 00:41:46,594
-My money's here.
-[Michael] No.

674
00:41:46,678 --> 00:41:49,014
Sorry, Judge.

675
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,725
Red? White?

676
00:41:51,808 --> 00:41:54,185
-Bourbon.
-[laughter]

677
00:41:54,227 --> 00:41:57,439
Did I ever tell you
how much I love you?

678
00:41:57,522 --> 00:41:58,690
-Mmm!
-No, Charlie...

679
00:41:58,773 --> 00:42:00,400
Wh... Get your
sticky hands off me!

680
00:42:00,483 --> 00:42:02,694
-And get me some bourbon.
-[chuckles]

681
00:42:02,777 --> 00:42:04,154
-[doorbell rings]
-[Charlie] You want ice?

682
00:42:04,195 --> 00:42:06,406
[Elizabeth]
No i... No, no. No ice.

683
00:42:06,489 --> 00:42:09,367
Okay. No, I got-I got it.

684
00:42:10,577 --> 00:42:12,078
-Hey.
-Hey.

685
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:13,329
I've been trying to call you.

686
00:42:13,371 --> 00:42:15,373
I-I didn't mean to disturb you.

687
00:42:15,415 --> 00:42:16,708
[Nancy] I have the DVDs.
You probably don't even know

688
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:18,626
-what that is, either.
-A DVD?

689
00:42:18,668 --> 00:42:19,961
-[laughs]
-Can you explain that one?

690
00:42:20,045 --> 00:42:21,379
We used to put things
in a machine...

691
00:42:21,463 --> 00:42:25,300
-[laughing]
-VHS. Oh, my gosh.

692
00:42:25,383 --> 00:42:26,676
Lee Delamere.

693
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,345
What you doing hanging out here
like a Jehovah's Witness?

694
00:42:29,387 --> 00:42:31,765
Get in here before
the Neighborhood Watch

695
00:42:31,806 --> 00:42:33,516
shoots your Creole ass.

696
00:42:33,558 --> 00:42:36,061
[crickets chirping]

697
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:38,480
[whispers]
Oh, Christ.

698
00:42:38,563 --> 00:42:40,440
-Come right on in.
-Everything's delicious.

699
00:42:40,523 --> 00:42:41,608
[chuckles]

700
00:42:41,649 --> 00:42:43,777
-Mm!
-I-I don't want to intrude.

701
00:42:43,818 --> 00:42:45,487
Let's, uh,
we'll sit you right here.

702
00:42:45,528 --> 00:42:47,906
-Hi.
-Hi.

703
00:42:47,947 --> 00:42:49,074
Hi.

704
00:42:49,574 --> 00:42:51,951
[Elizabeth]
I-I don't believe we've met.

705
00:42:52,035 --> 00:42:53,453
Uh, Lee Delamere.

706
00:42:53,536 --> 00:42:54,662
-Oh, uh...
-[Lee] Yeah.

707
00:42:54,704 --> 00:42:57,248
Elizabeth is
my mother-in-law. Here.

708
00:42:57,791 --> 00:42:59,584
Uh, I-I didn't want

709
00:42:59,626 --> 00:43:02,253
-to interrupt a family dinner.
-[Elizabeth] Well,

710
00:43:02,295 --> 00:43:04,631
here you are, so... sit.

711
00:43:04,672 --> 00:43:07,842
-Please.
-Adam was discussing his future.

712
00:43:07,884 --> 00:43:10,178
[Lee]
Well, that's... that's great.

713
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,430
Um... any ideas?

714
00:43:12,472 --> 00:43:15,517
Yeah. Uh, my mom
was a photographer.

715
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,852
So I think I'd like to try it.

716
00:43:17,936 --> 00:43:21,272
I'd love to see
some of your work.

717
00:43:22,148 --> 00:43:23,942
Sure.

718
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:26,569
-Hi. Hi.
-Oh. Nancy.

719
00:43:26,653 --> 00:43:28,404
Nice to meet you.
Michael forgot his manners.

720
00:43:28,488 --> 00:43:29,656
-[Nancy laughs]
-Yeah, sorry.

721
00:43:29,739 --> 00:43:31,241
No, in case
you change your mind.

722
00:43:31,324 --> 00:43:32,992
[Nancy] Oh, it's so delicious.
You really should have some.

723
00:43:33,034 --> 00:43:34,410
-I'll get you some wine, huh?
-It looks amazing.

724
00:43:34,494 --> 00:43:36,955
It smells amazing.

725
00:43:37,956 --> 00:43:41,960
-You should try the sausage.
-[laughing]

726
00:43:45,964 --> 00:43:46,673
Oh.

727
00:43:46,756 --> 00:43:50,301
Some of these,
actually, are Mom's.

728
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:52,595
Let me see those.

729
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:53,555
[mumbles]

730
00:43:53,638 --> 00:43:55,181
Thank you, honey.

731
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:57,475
-Thank you.
-Well,

732
00:43:57,559 --> 00:43:59,435
I've never seen these.

733
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:02,438
Uh, they were in Mom's Leica.

734
00:44:03,189 --> 00:44:05,483
So her last photographs.

735
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:08,820
God, she was good.

736
00:44:09,362 --> 00:44:10,905
Have you seen these?

737
00:44:10,947 --> 00:44:13,491
Uh, no.

738
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:18,496
[Nancy]
May I?

739
00:44:18,538 --> 00:44:20,707
Oh. Yeah. Of course.

740
00:44:21,416 --> 00:44:22,792
Yeah, pass those over.

741
00:44:22,876 --> 00:44:25,128
Don't get your...

742
00:44:27,755 --> 00:44:30,383
Oh, I remember you now.

743
00:44:30,425 --> 00:44:32,594
Yeah, yeah, the intern.

744
00:44:32,677 --> 00:44:34,637
[Lee exhales]

745
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:36,556
Long time ago.
[chuckles]

746
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:38,516
But now here you are.

747
00:44:40,977 --> 00:44:44,981
Just, uh, wanted to pick
Michael's brain about a case.

748
00:44:45,523 --> 00:44:47,567
At night at home?

749
00:44:47,609 --> 00:44:50,361
Some things can't wait.

750
00:44:51,237 --> 00:44:52,405
Go ahead.

751
00:44:57,493 --> 00:44:59,037
Okay.

752
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:04,751
A kid I was representing...

753
00:45:04,834 --> 00:45:07,462
well, he died in OPP.

754
00:45:07,545 --> 00:45:08,755
Actually, he was murdered,

755
00:45:08,796 --> 00:45:12,383
uh, after being tortured
by the NOPD.

756
00:45:12,467 --> 00:45:15,553
[Elizabeth]
That's a big word.

757
00:45:15,595 --> 00:45:17,889
Is that the right word?

758
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,935
Michael?

759
00:45:22,018 --> 00:45:23,978
Um...

760
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:27,523
Yes, it-it... it looks that way.

761
00:45:30,693 --> 00:45:32,237
[Lee]
The world is working very hard

762
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:36,866
to describe this child's death
as something of no interest.

763
00:45:36,908 --> 00:45:38,910
Him as someone of no value.

764
00:45:38,993 --> 00:45:44,040
But the world's doing that
because it's frightened.

765
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:47,543
I can smell the fear.

766
00:45:47,627 --> 00:45:49,837
That's a good thing,
'cause I can work on fear.

767
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:53,049
And with a little help
from our friends...

768
00:45:54,217 --> 00:45:57,220
When did you start
calling him Michael?

769
00:45:58,846 --> 00:46:00,890
Recently.

770
00:46:00,932 --> 00:46:03,643
-What kind of torture?
-Adam.

771
00:46:03,726 --> 00:46:06,312
I don't think we should be
talking about him like this.

772
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:07,522
[Lee]
Really?

773
00:46:07,563 --> 00:46:10,650
We've done 400 years
of not talking.

774
00:46:10,692 --> 00:46:14,112
Kind of in favor
of getting it out there.

775
00:46:15,655 --> 00:46:18,616
[Adam]
What'd they do to him?

776
00:46:22,745 --> 00:46:25,581
CS gas pumped through a hose

777
00:46:25,665 --> 00:46:26,833
into a locked vehicle

778
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:29,210
with him hog-tied inside.

779
00:46:29,252 --> 00:46:31,796
[Elizabeth]
What did this young man do?

780
00:46:31,879 --> 00:46:33,965
What, to get tortured?

781
00:46:34,007 --> 00:46:36,676
-To get arrested.
-[Django whining]

782
00:46:36,759 --> 00:46:37,802
-[barks]
-[Michael] Django.

783
00:46:37,885 --> 00:46:39,304
[whining]

784
00:46:39,345 --> 00:46:40,513
He stole a car.

785
00:46:40,555 --> 00:46:42,348
-Django!
-Mom's car.

786
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:44,475
Wait, you knew about this?

787
00:46:46,936 --> 00:46:48,146
He stole Robin's car,

788
00:46:48,187 --> 00:46:49,939
then he was tortured,
then he was murdered?

789
00:46:50,023 --> 00:46:51,774
The car was used
in a hit-and-run.

790
00:46:51,858 --> 00:46:54,527
[Elizabeth]
Well, you know what they say.

791
00:46:54,569 --> 00:46:55,945
Crime in this city.

792
00:46:56,029 --> 00:46:57,613
[Charlie]
Vote for Charlie Figaro.

793
00:46:57,655 --> 00:46:58,990
Tough on crime,

794
00:46:59,073 --> 00:47:01,075
-tough on the causes of crime.
-[Elizabeth] Big on plagiarism.

795
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:03,578
That's Tony Blair
you're not attributing.

796
00:47:03,619 --> 00:47:05,330
[Adam] Everyone
keeps calling him a kid,

797
00:47:05,413 --> 00:47:06,914
but...

798
00:47:06,956 --> 00:47:09,000
what was his name, Dad?

799
00:47:09,709 --> 00:47:14,005
-[Django whines]
-Kofi Jones.

800
00:47:14,505 --> 00:47:17,175
What was he like?

801
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,553
We were just at his home
this morning.

802
00:47:20,595 --> 00:47:21,971
I didn't know that.

803
00:47:22,013 --> 00:47:23,765
[Adam]
"We"?

804
00:47:23,848 --> 00:47:26,142
-[Django whining]
-Your father and I, uh,

805
00:47:26,184 --> 00:47:28,644
to give the family
the news of his death.

806
00:47:28,728 --> 00:47:31,147
-[barks, whining]
-Django. God...

807
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:33,858
Goddamn it.
Come on, get out of there.

808
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,778
Damn it, come on, get out
of there. Go on. Get out.

809
00:47:36,819 --> 00:47:39,614
Out. Go outside.

810
00:47:39,947 --> 00:47:42,575
The hell is so important
back here?

811
00:47:42,617 --> 00:47:45,161
Huh?

812
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:46,954
slow, somber music

813
00:47:48,581 --> 00:47:51,334
Is that blood?

814
00:47:54,754 --> 00:47:57,048
Uh, look, I-I, um...

815
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,718
I-I have something to say.

816
00:48:02,762 --> 00:48:04,055
Elizabeth, you're right.

817
00:48:04,138 --> 00:48:08,351
We haven't been talking
to all of you, and...

818
00:48:09,102 --> 00:48:10,978
...both of us, we've...

819
00:48:11,062 --> 00:48:12,939
been going inward

820
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:16,943
because of what happened
to Robin, and...

821
00:48:17,026 --> 00:48:18,319
I'm sorry.

822
00:48:18,403 --> 00:48:21,239
It's the last thing
she would have wanted.

823
00:48:25,284 --> 00:48:27,578
We are family.

826
00:48:37,755 --> 00:48:40,258
Excuse me.

[crickets chirping]

828
00:48:43,928 --> 00:48:46,389
Adam. Adam.

829
00:48:47,056 --> 00:48:50,101
-What the hell was that? Huh?
-What do you mean? What--

830
00:48:50,143 --> 00:48:52,186
You see what happens
when you don't listen to me?

831
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:53,980
Oh, you mean
when you're not in control

832
00:48:54,063 --> 00:48:55,398
-of every little thing?
-Yes. Yes.

833
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,775
I need to be in control.

834
00:48:57,817 --> 00:49:00,153
Listen... buddy, w-we...

835
00:49:00,236 --> 00:49:02,113
we have to...
we have to be tight.

836
00:49:02,196 --> 00:49:03,364
We have to be an alliance.

837
00:49:03,448 --> 00:49:07,618
You cannot just invite people
over for a chat.

838
00:49:07,702 --> 00:49:09,245
One phone call
to your grandmother,

839
00:49:09,328 --> 00:49:11,038
-and look at the consequences.
-Are you telling me I can't even

840
00:49:11,122 --> 00:49:13,124
talk to my own grandma
without getting your permission?

841
00:49:13,207 --> 00:49:14,375
-No, no, you know I am not--
-Yes!

842
00:49:14,459 --> 00:49:16,085
-You are.
-Nancy Costello.

843
00:49:16,169 --> 00:49:18,296
She's not a friendly
police officer to us.

844
00:49:18,337 --> 00:49:22,258
Not anymore. She's a detective,
and she can destroy us.

845
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,968
And what about
your new girlfriend, Dad?

846
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:25,261
-No, that... We're not--
-She is a lawyer

847
00:49:25,344 --> 00:49:27,555
-who could destroy us.
-That is not what it is.

848
00:49:27,638 --> 00:49:29,891
Look, Adam...

849
00:49:29,932 --> 00:49:33,728
you've got your whole life
ahead of you.

850
00:49:33,769 --> 00:49:35,062
And I know--

851
00:49:35,104 --> 00:49:36,772
But you didn't even tell me

852
00:49:36,856 --> 00:49:39,150
that he was tortured.

853
00:49:40,067 --> 00:49:43,362
I-I couldn't. I-I thought
it was best I didn't tell you

854
00:49:43,446 --> 00:49:45,114
-all the sordid details,
-How? How? Okay, yeah, no,

855
00:49:45,156 --> 00:49:47,450
-I get it--
-because you don't need to know.

856
00:49:47,533 --> 00:49:49,994
What, so you get to decide
what I get to know,

857
00:49:50,036 --> 00:49:51,746
-when I get to know it?
-Yes. Yes. Yes.

858
00:49:51,787 --> 00:49:55,416
I decide what the truth is.

859
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,709
That's right.

860
00:49:56,792 --> 00:49:58,419
That's exactly right.

861
00:49:58,461 --> 00:50:00,087
I get the lying.

862
00:50:00,171 --> 00:50:02,256
But can you j-just,
one time, just say it,

863
00:50:02,298 --> 00:50:05,718
just admit that
you know what happened?

864
00:50:08,012 --> 00:50:10,556
You want to know the truth?

865
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:17,980
A gang member stole our car

866
00:50:18,022 --> 00:50:19,774
and was involved
in a hit-and-run

867
00:50:19,857 --> 00:50:20,983
and killed a boy.

868
00:50:21,025 --> 00:50:25,071
That gang member
was tortured by the police.

869
00:50:25,154 --> 00:50:26,697
He pled guilty

870
00:50:26,739 --> 00:50:28,908
and went to jail...

871
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:32,703
and he died in jail.

872
00:50:34,539 --> 00:50:37,250
I am your father.

873
00:50:37,291 --> 00:50:41,754
I am being your father.

874
00:50:58,854 --> 00:50:59,981
Dad, I can Uber.

875
00:51:00,064 --> 00:51:03,859
Drive her. Watch her.
Bring her back.

876
00:51:03,901 --> 00:51:06,904
Why don't you just
buy her a motorcycle?

It's my fault that Adam lied.

883
00:52:52,259 --> 00:52:55,554
People lie for all sorts
of reasons, Elizabeth.

884
00:52:55,596 --> 00:52:57,890
I see it every day.

885
00:52:59,058 --> 00:53:03,854
And not all of those reasons
are bad ones.

886
00:53:05,022 --> 00:53:07,525
I know my son.

887
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:12,154
And he just
didn't want to hurt you

888
00:53:12,196 --> 00:53:16,033
by our failure to mark the day.

889
00:53:18,536 --> 00:53:22,373
His lying couldn't
be better motivated.

Uh, is that a sentence
you're proud of--

892
00:53:29,004 --> 00:53:32,007
well-motivated lying?

893
00:53:32,091 --> 00:53:35,886
Is that something
you want to teach your son?

894
00:53:44,311 --> 00:53:47,898
You know, there's
this thing that I do.

895
00:53:48,399 --> 00:53:51,360
Right at the end of a run.

The last 400 yards,

897
00:53:53,446 --> 00:53:57,491
as I turn down Seventh Street,

898
00:53:57,533 --> 00:54:01,036
I count the parked cars
I sprint by.

899
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:04,206
And the number of parked cars
that I pass

00:54:04,248 --> 00:54:07,501
before a moving car passes me--

901
00:54:07,543 --> 00:54:12,381
that's the number of years
Adam has to live.

902

It's stupid. I know.

903
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:27,772
But I give it
everything that I have.

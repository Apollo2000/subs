1
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:06,131
Previously on Your Honor...

2
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,594
[Big Mo] I got this baby

3
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,406
with holes in his heart
where his family used to be

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,141
and a mob boss motherfucker
with a blowtorch.

5
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,517
Baxters got to pay.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,602
They will, little man.

7
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,688
But Big Mo play the long game.

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,940
I don't know
who killed your son,

9
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,984
but it sure the fuck
wasn't Kofi.

10
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:30,739
If you want a war,
I can give you a war.

11
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,383
[Lee] I want to know
what happened to Kofi.

12
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,409
I need a second autopsy.

13
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,494
To do that, I need the signature

14
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,539
of a relative
who's over the age of 18.

15
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:42,500
Slow, somber music

16
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,502
[Adam] Django.

17
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,963
[Fia] I know you, right?

18
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,050
- Oh. Rocco's memorial.
- Tell me about an experience

19
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,218
that's had a big impact
on you recently.

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,930
I-I just met a really cool girl.

21
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:58,058
[cell phone chimes]

22
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,812
[Michael] Either of you know
how to trace a burner phone

23
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,689
to where it was purchased?

24
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,943
It's all there.
All the evidence we got.

25
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,612
[operator]
911, what's your emergency?

26
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,238
[Gina] The operator called back.

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,632
[operator]
This is the 911 operator.

28
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:14,717
You filled up. Now fuck off.

29
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,076
[Gina] That monster

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,702
who killed our son
was getting gas.

31
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,704
[Frankie] The 911 call?

32
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,581
Came from a cell tower
in Chalmette.

33
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,249
There's three gas stations.

34
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,710
[Leland]
He came here, wanted to see

35
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,754
the surveillance video.

36
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,214
You still have the footage?

37
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,381
[Leland] It got erased.

38
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,966
[Frankie]
He deleted the footage?

39
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,778
- [Leland] Yeah.
- I need to tell you something.

40
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,720
I-I don't have
all the money yet.

41
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,222
I need more time!

42
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,182
[blackmailer]
You're out of time, man.

43
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,434
Eerie, intense music

44
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,269
[crowd cheering]

45

OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

low, suspenseful music

47
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,632
[key clicks]

48
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,158
[sighs]

49
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,702
You never see it coming.

50
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,954
[radio playing softly]

51
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:47,125
You can go for months,
months and months,

52
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:51,629
and then there's one
that just...

53
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:55,508
just hits you
right in the belly, you know?

54
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,677
Single mom,

55
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,681
mother of four,
two completely unmanageable,

56
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,934
two jobs, rescue pit bull.

57
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:08,438
I mean, she's a good person,
which makes her a mark.

58
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,440
So, some guy comes sailing in,

59
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,234
claiming to be the man
that this family has needed,

60
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:17,113
and then starts punching her.

61
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,325
- Ever call it in?
- Oh, no. No, she doesn't,

62
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,994
because of course
he comes groveling back,

63
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:27,248
promising to change, doesn't,
happens again.

64
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,375
Always.

65
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,253
God, I'm sorry. Uh...

66
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,923
You, of course,
know better than anyone.

67
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,799
[chuckles dryly]

68
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,345
NOPD doesn't get involved.

69
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,722
They can't.
It's... they're unaware.

70
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:47,018
Until one night,
when Mom decides to fight back.

71
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,979
And he calls it in.

72
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,943
- [groans]
- Now, you all haul her away

73
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,361
on assault.

74
00:03:56,444 --> 00:04:00,531
Her PD suggests that
she pleads out, and she does.

75
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,326
And so, by the time
that she's released,

76
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,120
she's lost her jobs, her home,

77
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:10,792
her kids are in temporary
custody, veering on permanent,

78
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:14,879
and that loser ex
has left with the dog

79
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,673
and every penny in her account.

80
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,049
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

81
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,301
Now, that's not even
the good part yet.

82
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:24,430
So, when she files
a report for the theft,

83
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,058
she learns that this guy

84
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:30,728
has been using a fake name
the whole time.

85
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,147
I wrote down what she has.

86
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,025
A-And I wrote it down
because I thought that s...

87
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:39,612
maybe somehow I could,
I could help her.

88
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,364
Wrote down what?

89
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,117
Oh.

90
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,369
Um...

91
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,415
Here. Yeah.

92
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,712
- Green Toyota Camry.
- Yeah. That's all she has.

93
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,339
And these are the first
three numbers of the license...

94
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,174
Right, that's all
she could remember.

95
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,428
And I don't even know if that's
enough to trace the car or...

96
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,305
You know?

97
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:09,309
You know,
I bet if I punch this in,

98
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:14,147
it'll spit out five names,
give or take.

99
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,273
Wow.

100
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,900
How much you want to bet
one of them has a record?

101
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,111
[radio continues playing softly]

102
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,745
[Nancy] Hmm.

103
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,122
Squeaky clean, all four of them.

104
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,709
Hmm.

105
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,965
Um...

106
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,509
Could I have them anyway?

107
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,515
- They're private citizens...
- And one of them is a violent,

108
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:53,061
woman-hating piece of crap
who's probably just smart enough

109
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:56,522
not to get caught
so he doesn't have a record.

110
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,531
Nancy, this poor fucking woman
just doesn't have a chance.

111
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:10,328
But we can give her a-a leg
to stand on in-in family court

112
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,706
and maybe she doesn't
lose her kids.

113
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,586
[Michael sighs]

114
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,881
Jesus, listen to me.
Holier than thou.

115
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,344
Asking you to bend the law

116
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,639
I'm complaining no one upholds?

117
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,433
God, what a hypocrite.

118
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,893
[Nancy] No.

119
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,895
Hypocrisy is probably
the last thing

120
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:39,315
anyone would ever accuse you of.

121

00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:48,241
I got to go to the bathroom.

123
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,663
Keep an eye?

Are you sure about this, Jimmy?

A judge?

[laughs] Oh.

137
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,953
Are you looking
at my cool T-shirt

or-or at my breasts?

[laughs]

140

It's Rocco's. He loved it.

Here.

Slow, solemn music

There he is.

145
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,479
Huh.

146
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,356
W-What was the last

147
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,275
big conversation
you had with him?

148
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:56,280
Um, he had a plan,
for his life, really.

149
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,199
He told me about it.

150
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,160
What was the plan?

151
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,954
Shoot for the moon, basically.

152
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:07,124
Um, Paris for the summer.

153
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,753
And then, uh...
and then art school in London,

154
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,713
probably living in Clerkenwell

155
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,799
or Hoxton with
the French girlfriend

156
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,134
he probably met
at some Left Bank Café.

157
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,761
[chuckles]

158
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,013
He was planning that?

159
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,557
Some of that's me...

160
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,851
keeping his future going.

161
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,232
Um, what about you?

162
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,776
Last big conversation.

163
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,587
Uh, we never really got
to talking like that.

164
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,655
No, I-I mean with your mom.

165
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,658
Oh, uh...

166
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:44,412
Yeah, I'll-I'll always remember
the last thing she said to me.

167
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:48,040
We were in the car, and
sh-she turned to me all solemn

168
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,792
and she lowered
her voice a little bit,

169
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,210
and she said...

170
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,213
"Did you fart?"

171
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,425
[laughs softly] What?

172
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:00,845
- Yeah.
- Oh.

173
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,179
And I-I got out of the car

174
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,764
and went into school, and...

175
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,312
...never saw her again.

176
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,864
Suspenseful music

177
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,321
[Fia] So, did you?

178
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,322
[Adam] What?

179
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,282
Did you fart?

180
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,159
- [chuckles]
- No.

181
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:50,162
- It was, uh, my dog. Django.
- Uh-huh.

182
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,540
My mom just liked
messing with me.

183
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,333
Maybe it was her.

184
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,086
You mean the-the last thing

185
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,672
my mother did in my presence
before she died was fart?

186
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,882
Is that what you're saying?

187
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,801
[laughs]

188
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,682
I'd give anything
to have been with him.

189
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:15,020
I keep replaying
his last morning.

190
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,274
I don't want it to, but it...

191
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,526
forces its way
to the front of my mind,

192
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,111
and stays there...

193
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:26,448
like that's all that exists
in his 17 years of life.

194
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,743
All the moments before,
thousands of moments we shared,

195
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:34,164
just get squeezed out
like they're not important.

196
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,544
That's what the guy
who killed Rocco did.

197
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:42,172
He didn't just kill my brother.

198
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,426
He killed my life
with my brother.

199
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,769
[birds chirping]

200
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,063
[brakes screech]

201
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,870
I'm just delivering groceries
for apartment 200.

202
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,916
Edward or Edouard Lincoln,
I believe.

203
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,960
I'm with Good Egg.

204
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,713
It's a nonprofit
providing healthful foods

205
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:23,714
for those in need.

206
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,132
Those in need?

207
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,760
Sounds like you write hymns
in your spare time.

208
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,304
I don't have any spare time.

209
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,765
This is my whole life.

210
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,267
- [knocking]
- [door unlocking]

211
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,936
You got some grub, bub.

212
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,105
Hey.

213
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,610
Uh...

214
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,904
Edouard, I-I..

215
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,323
I've got some groceries for you.

216
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,908
Danny?

217
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,035
Well, I'll be dogged!

218
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,746
Nobody told me you were coming.

219
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,334
Uh...

220
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:04,755
Yeah, well, I-I tried to call,

221
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:08,592
but then I thought
I'd just... show up.

222
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,719
Was that phone busy

223
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,430
or just ring e-eternally?

224
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,933
They wheel me out to the phone
once a week,

225
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,978
but the nurses are
always tying up the lines

226
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,438
jabbing with their boyfriends.

227
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,315
How's Tampa?

228
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,900
Tampa?

229
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,111
Oh, uh...

230
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,947
Hot as all get out.

231
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,825
Well, the Lord done
rain down his wrath

232
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,119
on our little armpit, don't he?

233
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,078
[laughs]

234
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,747
You talk to the other cousins?

235
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,416
I don't much.

236
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,335
They tell me I got the dementia,

237
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,130
so I probably wouldn't remember
even if I did.

238
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,132
How's Tampa?

239
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,676
It's hot, Ed.

240
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:54,221
- [chuckles]
- Now, look, uh...

241
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,974
You got everything now,
so I'll...

242
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,226
I'll-I'll see you
some other time.

243
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,020
You're leaving?

244
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,355
Jesus H...

245
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,399
Danny, you just got here.

246
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,861
Look, rest your bones.

247
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,368
And how you been?

248
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,626
Well...

249
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,548
To be honest, Ed...

250
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,509
...I've been better.

251
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,474
It's hard all over.

252
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,560
But if you can't
bare your soul to family,

253
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,563
then I don't know what's what.

254
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,785
I just...

255
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,912
[sobs softly]

256
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,626
I just...

257
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:09,129
feel so much pressure, you know?

258
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,841
[sighs heavily]

259
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,259
[inhales deeply]

260
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,428
[exhales heavily]

261
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,307
[mumbles]

262
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:25,771
It's like
a 100,000 fucking pounds of...

263
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,068
...steel just pressing
down on my shoulders.

264
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:42,079
I've got a man trying
to ruin my life.

265
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,584
I've got secrets
I can never tell anyone.

266
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,757
My son...

267
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,472
My son.

268
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,351
[sighs heavily]

269
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:20,492
Children are God's gift.

270
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,329
Yeah.

271
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,750
But that level of love
can just crack you open.

272
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,174
Make you someone
you never thought you'd be.

273
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,930
You remember
when Trevor was born?

274
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:47,269
Everything about him was wrong,

275
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,313
even in the womb.

276
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:53,066
Kicking like he couldn't
wait to get out of there.

277
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:56,612
What's that term
for wrong way round?

278
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,865
Lorraine, she had a terrible
time getting him out

279
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,659
'cause he was ass first.

280
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,370
Sixty-seven cigarettes.

281
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,831
What?

282
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,541
I counted every one of them.

283
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,545
Pacing in the hall
outside the delivery room...

284
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:19,176
...till someone come
and said I was a father.

285
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,761
Uh-huh.

286
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,471
Your son.

287
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,390
My one and only son...

288
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:30,896
...fucked up before, during
and after he was born.

289
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,317
- Breached.
- Huh?

290
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,903
- Ass first.
- Yeah.

291
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,405
And ever since.

292
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,659
He's still troubled?

293
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,578
Dolly Parton sleep on her back?

294
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,041
Though I wouldn't know.

295
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,960
He don't visit.

296
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,295
I talk to the nurses, but...

297
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,130
Ed, Ed.

298
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,549
He-He's living
in Algiers now, right?

299
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,094
Got a job driving?

300
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,180
He stole my Camry.

301
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:09,851
If you see him, you tell him
I'm calling the police,

302
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,561
the real police.

303
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,147
Ominous music

304
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:18,485
I liked that dress she wore
to the Grammys in 1977.

305
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,240
Pink was pink back then,

306
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:27,119
and nobody did pink like Dolly.

307
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,372
Ed...

308
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:35,460
why don't we get you
in this chair, huh?

309
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,797
And, I don't know...

310
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,633
...have a little outing?

311
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,720
[chuckles] Thank you!

312
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,806
There we go.

313
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,729
There we go. Oh, geez, Ed.

314
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,897
Wait a minute,
I'll be right back.

315
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,317
I-I forgot my keys.

316
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:43,153
[Edouard]
Sixty-seven cigarettes,

317
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:47,407
and that ass-first motherfucker
steals my Camry.

318
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,576
Dark, suspenseful music

319
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,957
- [car door closes]
- [engine starts]

320
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,601
[Fia] Turn off your phone.

321
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,687
No phones in Wonderland.

322

- Ooh. [laughs]
- [grunts]

330
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,842
You good?

331
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,390
Hey, so, um,

332
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,684
I'm sure you checked me
out online.

333
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:24,731
Don't lie. Don't ever lie to me.

334
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,568
[laughs softly]

335
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,654
And?

336
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:35,033
Um...

337
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,702
Y-Your dad...

338
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,706
He came from nothing.

339
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:44,209
He started working
when he was nine years old

340
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:47,504
to support his mom and his
younger brothers and sisters

341
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,172
and he made it.

342
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,591
Now he own restaurants
and hotels

343
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,344
and sell oysters to every
oyster joint in the city.

344
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:58,306
When we were young,
he used to wake us up

345
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,934
every morning
with the same words:

346
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,562
"The world is your oyster."

347
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:06,439
somber, cerebral music

348
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,733
You love him.

349
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:16,449
Whatever you read about him
is lies.

350
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:23,540
My older brother...

351
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,003
[screams]

352
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,255
[exhales]

353
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,717
[stifled laugh]

354
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:44,561
[both scream]

355
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,105
[both laugh]

356
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,903
- Thanks, man. Have a good night.
- Yeah.

357
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:00,827
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hold on, hold on.

358
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:04,623
Listen, sorry, I called for
a car, but, uh, my phone died,

359
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,125
and, anyway, I-I've got a 50,

360
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,669
and I j... I need to get
to a place called Buffa's,

361
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,797
on Esplanade,
or Esplanaid, or....

362
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,508
slow, suspenseful music

363
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:24,976
You know what I'd really like to
do with my time while I'm here?

364
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,102
Fish.

365
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:29,356
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

366
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:32,609
Are those boat tours worth it?

367
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:35,403
Eh, most of them are scams,
but I know a few guys.

368
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:39,032
What, uh, what you want to fish?

369
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:42,994
Oh, I-I don't know.
I'm-I'm an amateur.

370
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,998
You know, maybe some,
just, deep water.

371
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,876
Hell yeah, man.
Deep water's where it's at.

372
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,420
You got your yellowfin
out there, you got you marlins,

373
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,963
your wahoo.

374
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,733
I'll tell you what,
you get a guy with a boat

375
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:59,511
knows what he's doing,
get some... some cold beers...

376
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:01,888
[laughs softly]

377
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,431
- Tuna. Oof.
- Yep.

378
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,683
They get pretty big.

379
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:07,018
- You ever catch one of those?
- Oh, yeah. Course I have.

380
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,396
Biggest I ever caught
was about 168 pounds,

381
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:12,816
but my friend set the record
last year with 242.

382
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,235
- Wow.
- Yeah.

383
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:18,697
And I'm gonna break that record,
once I get my own boat.

384
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,616
- You're getting a boat?
- Yep.

385
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:24,828
She's sitting down at Boat Stuf
in the marina right now.

386
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:28,665
2020 Sea Fox 328 Commander,
in Bahama Blue.

387
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:31,459
Talking about 32 feet
of featherlight fiberglass.

388
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:32,794
And when I'm not in this seat,

389
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,505
I'm gonna be sitting
in that one.

390
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,965
Wow.

391
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,758
What's that gonna set you back?

392
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,052
Over 200 grand.

393
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,975
[whistles]

394
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:55,984
Uh, listen, w-we must be
getting kind of close, right?

395
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,294
Why-why don't you just pull over

396
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,237
and I'll-I'll walk
the rest of the way?

397
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,656
- You sure?
- Yeah.

398
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,753
[Michael] Thanks.

399
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:28,099
[buzzing]

400
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,601
[Gina] Boys.

401
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,646
Oh. Hey, Ms. B.

402
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,940
Hey, Mom.

403
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,779
Veggies, for Chef
from the farmers market.

404
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:46,117
I'll make sure no one
bothers you, sweetheart.

405
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,621
Thanks, Mom.

406
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,290
Eerie, suspenseful music

407
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,048
It's gonna be
the hottest shit in Nola.

408
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,008
- Period.
- [hisses]

409
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,803
We're gonna turn 150 grand

410
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,764
- into half a mil.
- [exhales]

411
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,183
Then we're gonna do it again

412
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,786
and the whole waterfront
and every casino

413
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,521
will be Baxter-owned
and my father will see

414
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:17,065
that I was fucking right.

415
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,609
- Here.
- [exhales]

416
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:20,819
Try this.

417
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,196
You're my guinea pig, Joey.

418
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,657
- [panting]
- [indistinct chatter]

419
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,745
slow, tense music

420
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,171
[panting]

421
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,302
[phone buzzing]

422
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:53,184
Um, are you gonna
get that or what?

423
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:56,187
It's not mine. I...

424
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,190
I think it's coming from...

425
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,944
[buzzing continues]

426
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,700
Hello?

427
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:09,951
[Michael] Trevor.

428
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,202
Noon tomorrow.

429
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,203
Venice Marina.

430
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:13,872
If you want your money,

431
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,373
you'll be there.

432
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,042
Unarmed and alone.

433
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,503
- W-Wait, uh...
- [hangs up]

434
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,257
Fuck.

435
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,845
Slow, tense music

436
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,391
- [whimpering softly]
- [indistinct chatter]

437
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,103
[crickets chirping]

438
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,070
slow, haunting music

439
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,172
[crickets chirping]

440
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,435
You sure?

441
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,150
[Adam] Y-You can drop me here.

442
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,569
Is this your house?

443
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,488
Uh, no.

444
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:31,032
So which is yours?

445
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,076
It-it... it's around the corner,

446
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,036
- but...
- Wait, wait, wait.

447
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,829
What, are you, like,
embarrassed?

448
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,957
You don't want your dad
to see me?

449
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,459
- No...
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

450
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,796
I'm right.
Okay, I'm gonna do this.

451
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,214
Do... what?

452
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,549
I'm gonna stop
right in front of your house,

453
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,926
lean on the horn and kiss you

454
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,261
like you've never been kissed
before in your life.

455
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,810
Right or left?

456
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,604
Don't lie to me.

457
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,318
- Don't.
- [laughs]

458
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,008
slow, intense music

459
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,708
[quiet clattering]

460
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,762
[sighs]

461
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,472
Adam.

462
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,736
Both of them?

463
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:51,130
[starts engine]

464
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:54,175
I ever tell you the time
when I first met your mother

465
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,593
in New York?

466
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,220
She was at NYU,

467
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:00,515
living in the West Village,
and I

468
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,183
was at Columbia,

469
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:06,562
in a two-bedroom, sharing it
with three other guys,

470
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,606
six-floor walk-up in Harlem.

471
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,858
- [chuckles]
- But for some reason,

472
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,401
we found ourselves studying

473
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,487
at the same café
in the East Village.

474
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,490
And, oh, boy,
I wanted to talk to her.

475
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:20,409
I really did, but I-I thought

476
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,162
maybe I never would.

477
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,872
[sighs]

478
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:28,126
I don't know, maybe it was...

479
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,211
shyness or...

480
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,630
I was intimidated.

481
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,298
She was so beautiful.

482
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,384
One day she walks in,

483
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:40,012
and she is wearing
this blue knitted scarf,

484
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,140
and she's so poised.

485
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:46,519
And suddenly it was possible.

486
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:50,565
So I just walked
right up to her table,

487
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,818
and I said what I had to say.

488
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,530
"I like your scarf?"

489
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,908
[laughing]

490
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,827
It came out like a question.

491
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:06,164
Wha... I-I don't know.
Don't ask me.

492
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,666
But she starts...

493

she looked at me...

00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,342
with a look...

497
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:21,512

504
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,995

used to play on long car rides

a couple and try to say

508
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,683
- which one of them scored?
- Mm, uh-huh.

509
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,478
So... you and Mom?

Is that your next question?

Few minutes after he passed,
I heard the guards yelling.

660
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,315
Jones was dead.

661
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:40,237
Do you know which inmate
he went to meet?

662
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,950
See, at mess,
I like to be by myself.

663
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,660
So I could read.

664
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,829
There's one guy,
he come up to me real quiet,

665
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,206
asking me if I know
who Kofi Jones is.

666
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:55,627
I just look at him
and get back to my book.

667
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,088
Black?

668
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,798
White?

669
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,384
White dude.

670
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,763
He was just there for the night,
passing through.

671
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,475
Do you know his name?

672
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,229
I do.

673
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:20,444
Can you give it to me?

674
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,450
[exhales]

675
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,789
[breathes deeply]

676
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,921
Carlo.

677
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,049
Carlo Baxter.

678
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,436
You'll be great.

679
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,688
You think?

680
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,941
Actually, no.

681
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:01,151
You'll be inarticulate as hell.

682
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,861
They'll probably take you anyway

683
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,447
'cause of your good, clean,
all-American looks.

684
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,032
- Mm.
- Mm.

685
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:14,706
Hey, I'm not sure
I want to do this.

686
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:21,505
Here's what you do.

687
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:24,174
When they ask you
a big question,

688
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:25,676
you stare at the ground.

689
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:26,927
Like, forever.

690
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:29,239
Like, let the silence run until
it's actually uncomfortable.

691
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,932
And then, you say

692
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:34,393
you've never been able to talk
about the thing you love.

693
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:37,646
In fact, it's really important
not to talk about it,

694
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:39,523
for fear of losing it.

695
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:42,568
Then you quote Robert Frank.
Uh...

696
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:46,905
"Things move on, time passes,
people go away.

697
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,490
Sometimes they don't come back."

698
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,993
Only the pictures remain.

699
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:57,040
Yeah, but if I get in,
if I go, I...

700
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:01,253
I mean, I'd miss New Orleans.

701
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,381
Sure.

702
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:07,467
But you got to, you know,

703
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:10,512
shoot for the moon. Right?

704
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:17,185
[Grether]
You have a suspect yet?

705
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:21,231
Yeah.

706
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,692
Not enough to make
anything happen.

707
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:28,363
Would DNA help?

708
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:35,704
Hello, this is Lee Delamere
calling for D.A. Robinson.

709
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:38,206
Okay, can you please
tell him that I called?

710
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:41,168
And I need him
to call me back immediately.

711
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:43,378
Up-tempo string music playing

712
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:14,826
[phone rings, buzzes]

713
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:21,458
Lee?

714
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,810
Yeah, look,
I can't talk right now.

715
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,252
- We got him.
- What?

716
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:27,089
We got Carlo Baxter's DNA
on Kofi.

717
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,465
Oh, that's great. That's great.

718
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:31,009
Look... [stammers]
I got to call you back.

719
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,767
Uh, no...

720
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,978
[Michael grunts]

721
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,729
Okay, come on, come on.

722
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,275
Go on.

723
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:52,447
It took time to figure out how
to deal with a lowlife like you.

724
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:56,076
Someone who takes advantage
of other people's pain.

725
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,329
A child's pain.

726
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,049
Wait a second.

727
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,302
What-what is she doing here?

728
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,888
I had it brought down.

729
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:20,142
Holy shit, you bought me
the boat!

730
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,936
Trevor, I'm a judge.

731
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,397
If there's one thing
I've learned about blackmailers

732
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,691
is they always
come back for more.

733
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:30,318
So, no, I didn't buy you a boat.

734
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:32,487
I financed it.

735
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,322
But it's mine?

736
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:36,992
If you stick to our agreement,

737
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:40,412
I will make
the monthly installments.

738
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:43,457
If you ever come back to me
for more money

739
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:45,917
or that video
sees the light of day,

740
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:49,087
the payments will stop,
the bank will repossess the boat

741
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:53,425
and you'll go back to living
your selfish little life.

742
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:57,804
While your lonely demented
father wastes away in his room.

743
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:03,643
Do we have an agreement?

744
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:09,357
Trevor, do we have an agreement?

745
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,903
Fuck yes, we have an agreement.

746
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,822
Paperwork's in the car.

747
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:19,242
[Trevor] [whispers]
Paperwork's in the fucking car.

748
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:25,999
You know what, you should, uh,

749
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,751
you should come out
with me sometime, man.

750
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:29,669
No, I'm serious,
I mean, we-we'll, uh, uh,

751
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,254
we'll get good beer
and everything.

752
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:33,840
- It'll be frigging aw...
- [gasps]

753
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:36,093
[grunts]

754
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,309
dramatic music playing

755
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:55,362
Uh, there-there must be
a misunderstanding here.

756
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:56,905
- [grunts]
- Oh! [grunts]

757
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,868
No. No.

758
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,454
No, the only misunderstanding

759
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:08,583
is that you left my son to die

760
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,418
alone...

761
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,254
in the gutter.

762
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:14,756
What I can't understand is

763
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,800
how anyone in their right mind

764
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:18,260
could do such a thing.

765
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:21,221
[stammers] I don't-I don't know
what you're talking about.

766
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:22,347
[whimpering]

767
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,808
Here's-here's
what I know, Judge.

768
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:31,022
I know your car was stolen
the day after you killed my son.

769
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:35,110
I know you deleted
the gas station footage.

770
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,654
I know you had the car crushed.

771
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:39,531
So let's just skip

772
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:41,950
you're denying everything
and get to where I shoot you

773
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:44,161
- in the fucking head.
- No, no, no, no, no

774
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:47,956
no, no, please, no, no, no...
Carlo!

775
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:54,713
Carlo. He's...
he's about to be arrested

776
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:57,465
for the murder of Kofi Jones.

777
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,759
- [dialing]
- It's... Yes.

778
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:03,138
And he's-he's going
to stand trial for murder.

779
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:05,700
- They-They've got video evidence
- [Frankie speaks indistinctly]

780
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,476
and-and-and DNA...

781
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:09,978
No, no, and....

782
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:12,355
I-I can make sure that...

783
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:15,150
that hi-his case is in my court.

784
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:20,030
I can make sure
that he walks out a free man!

785
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:26,161
- [Frankie] Jimmy?
- You... shut up!

786
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,293
Shut up.

787
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,879
Let me think.

788
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:56,524
What does this person know?

789
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,419
Everything.

790
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:35,272

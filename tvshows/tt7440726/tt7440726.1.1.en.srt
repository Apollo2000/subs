2
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,610
You should go.

3
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,571
Really?

4
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,407
Okay.

5
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,620
Really?

6
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,222
Hi, bud.

7
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,756
See you at school.

8
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,716
Wait...

9
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,404
dramatic music

10
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,161
Django.

11
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,190
Morning.

12
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,151
- Take it off.
- Where was Nana born?

13
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,945
- Mom.
- It's okay. It's a T-shirt.

14
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,989
- It's my T-shirt.
- Mom.

15
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,406
Let him wear it.

16
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,261
Sometimes I think
you prefer him to me.

17
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,828
Oh, my God,
how could you not say,

18
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:25,972
- like, "I love you all?"
- Mom.

19
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,331
- Scotland.
- Yeah,

20
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,893
she said she was
gonna take me back

21
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,917
- to "Edin-burrow."
- That is not how you pronounce

22
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,004
that word... it is "brah."

23
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,948
- "Edin-burah"?
- No, that's wrong.

24
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,567
You know that's wrong.

25
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,693
- It's "brah."
- "Edin-burah."

26
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,797
- No. "Brah."
- "Edin-boro."

27
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,803
- No.
- "En-brah."

28
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,054
"Brah."

29
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,723
Dad?

30
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,603
Who put that there?

31
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,273
On my lawn!

32
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:56,903
Wha...?

33
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,155
Oh, my God. It's...

34
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,200
That's a café racer custom,
is what it is.

35
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,370
It's got to be, like,
what, like, 1970-something?

36
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,829
Uh, 1974.

37
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,460
Now, they could've been cheap
and gone with red,

38
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,476
but the original green's
a lot classier.

39
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,172
- Oh, my God, Dad.
- You see... whoa, whoa, whoa,

40
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,539
whoa, no, no, no, no, no, no.

41
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,632
450s are a long way up
from the 125s

42
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,131
we toured around Corfu on.

43
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,886
Jimmy, this gift is for Rocco.
It's not for you.

44
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,430
It's mine?

45
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,642
Your mother wanted me to wait
for your actual birthday,

46
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,602
but, uh...

47
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,648
Oh, my God, Mom.

48
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,137
Do you know how to ride
this thing?

49
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,989
- Yes.
- "Yes."

50
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,949
Ha-ha! Are you sure?

51
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,701
- Yes, Dad.
- Huh? Yeah?

52
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,911
Want me to show you?

53
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,925
Ha!

54
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,727
Low, pulsing music

55
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,866
You police?

56
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,996
Well, what you want?

57
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,416
Hello?

58
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,421
Hey, man, who are you?

59
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,424
Who are you?!

60
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,528
Quiet, percussive music

61
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,683
low, suspenseful music

62
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,666
suspenseful music

63
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,135
soft, haunting music

64
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,955
pulsing, dramatic music

65
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,337
911. What's your emergency?

66
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,631
- Help.
- Hello?

67
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,926
Are you there?
I can barely hear you.

68
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,807
Can you hear me? Hello?

69
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,395
Listen, I'm going to stay
on the line.

70
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,332
Stay calm.
We're gonna get you some help.

71
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,192
We just need to work out
where you are.

72
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,196
Please, if you can...

73
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,160
Hello? Can you hear me?

74
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,211
We're having trouble
working out where you are.

75
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,113
If you're in the city, hit one
of the keys on your phone,

76
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,211
any key.

77
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,132
Hello?

78
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,943
Don't worry,
I'm going to stay right here

79
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,471
on the line with you...

80
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,079
Hello?

81
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,665
We want to get
someone out there.

82
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,670
Is there anyone
that can help you?

83
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,256
Anybody?

84
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:30,137
There must be someone that
you can pass the phone to.

85
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,117
Don't worry, I'm gonna stay
right here on the line with you,

86
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,581
but please
try to communicate with me

87
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,479
so we can get you some help.

88
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,357
Hello? Are you there?
I can barely hear you.

89
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,604
Soft, contemplative music

90
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,486
No, no, no, no, no...

91
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,197
Fuck...

92
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,081
S-So sorry. Sorry.

93
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,562
Hi. This is Michael Desiato.

94
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,397
Please leave a message.

95
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,568
Dad...

96
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,782
dramatic music

97
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,912
- Female Jones.
- Custody.

98
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,624
It's Female,
like I told you yesterday.

99
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,326
Where have you been, Counselor?

100
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,130
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

101
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,592
Sure, but you were also late
yesterday morning,

102
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,428
so what's the answer
to my question?

103
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:17,929
I have a problem.

104
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,765
Getting out of bed
in the morning?

105
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,684
I need to take a pee
every 15 minutes.

106
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,895
Prostate cancer
can slow a man down.

107
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,314
I'm sorry.

108
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,191
No, I'm sorry.

109
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:33,153
We can take convenience breaks.
That'd be all right?

110
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:37,449
Counselor? Call your witness.

111
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,965
So I go to the house

112
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,592
up the steps to the door.

113
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:37,884
What do you see?

114
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,145
Down the end of the hallway,
in the bathroom,

115
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,264
I saw the accused
lift her dress,

116
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,767
move her panties to one side
and insert a drug wrap

117
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,394
into her... self.

118
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:52,149
Got to say, it was, uh, kind of
an expert move, Your Honor,

119
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,817
like she'd done it before.

120
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,236
Objection!

121
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,615
Now, "inside herself"?

122
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,159
Her, uh, downstairs, Your Honor.

123
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,036
- Front or back?
- Front.

124
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,621
And you saw that

125
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,165
from the front door, all of it?

126
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:12,628
The... her vagina,
the panties, the drug wrap?

127
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,048
- Moves?
- Absolutely.

128
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,716
Do we have photographs?

129
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,385
- No, Your Honor.
- No.

130
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,115
Very impressive detail
you've given us.

131
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,200
Well, it's important
to be precise.

132
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,767
I agree.

133
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,602
It's critical.

134
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:37,778
Young man,
could you step forward?

135
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,070
Yes. Yes, you.

136
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:42,574
Would you meet me down here?
Hmm?

137
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,920
What's your name?

138
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,588
Eugene.

139
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,209
Eugene, where's your father?

140
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,175
- Busy.
- With what?

141
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,720
Side girlfriend.
Selling some shit up on Rampart.

142
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,765
When's the last time
you saw him?

143
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,480
What did you eat
for breakfast, Eugene?

144
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,023
Uh,

145
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,482
we had some pickle juice.

146
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,069
Hot fries sometimes
when we helped out.

147
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,488
When who helps you out?

148
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,867
My older brother, sometimes.

149
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,495
He's affiliated?

150
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,333
Thank you, Eugene.
You may sit back down.

151
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,170
I just wanted you to have
some context, Officer.

152
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,556
You see, if this woman
is found guilty by me,

153
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,175
she'll go to jail
for a minimum of five years,

154
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,178
and her smallest children,

155
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,056
they'll be placed
into child protective custody.

156
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:52,853
It's possible that she won't
ever see them again.

157
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,147
And Eugene, well,

158
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:59,026
the Desire Crew will surely
get their hands on him,

159
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,070
to sell drugs down
at the open-air market

160
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,656
that they run down there.

161
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,286
So, let me ask you this:

162
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,664
in front of the God
that you swore by

163
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,127
and the badge you wear and now
with everything that you know

164
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:22,674
about this family,
are you telling us the truth?

165
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,259
Yes, sir. I swear it.

166
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:27,012
Okay. Well, you're a very
convincing witness.

167
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:30,140
Which would be
more than enough for me,

168
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:34,186
were it not that I am
in training for a marathon,

169
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:38,774
and I really love
running up stairways.

170
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,191
Including the stoop steps

171
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,402
at 5700 Flood Street
in the Lower Ninth.

172
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,748
Are you sure you want
to stick to the answer

173
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:47,908
- that you just gave me?
- Yes, sir.

174
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,994
Now, it's a shotgun house,
isn't that right?

175
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,411
- Yes.
- Do you know why

176
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,206
they call them a shotgun house?

177
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,043
You could stand at the
front door and fire a shotgun

178
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,921
straight through to
the back door and out.

179
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,213
Isn't that right?

180
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,467
- Uh, yes, Your Honor.
- All the rooms...

181
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,845
Living room, kitchen,
bedrooms and bathroom...

182
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,264
Are off the side
of the hallway, hmm?

183
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,058
I mean, it's a clean shot.

184
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,443
All the way, front to back.

185
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,560
You sure you're sticking

186
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,856
with the answer
that you gave me?

187
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,317
I stood at the doorway

188
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,381
of 5700 Flood Street,
just as you did.

189
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,270
The same front door that
you just testified, under oath,

190
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:31,201
that you saw Female Jones,
in the bathroom,

191
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:35,038
put a drug wrap
up inside herself.

192
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,333
Now, here's my question:
do you have

193
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:42,421
see-around-corner eyes,

194
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:48,427
or are you a liar,
of the vilest kind?

195
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,730
Dark, suspenseful music

196
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,208
This is the 911 operator...

197
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,442
You filled up. Now fuck off.

198
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,837
Just stay on the line,
we'll get you some help.

199
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,280
We just need to work out
where you are.

200
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,074
Please, if you can...

201
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,962
soft, percussive music

202
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,696
haunting, somber music

203
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,157
Django.

204
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,356
Just keep your hope
in your heart.

205
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,234
Y'all take real good care
of each other now, you hear?

206
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,694
Geez.

207
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,114
When did you start sounding
like a Hallmark card?

208
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,615
This morning.

209
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,535
Wh... wait, whoa...
Are you running?

210
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,453
Announcement on Monday.

211
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,870
Ha! That's great!

212
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,456
That is terrific.

213
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,125
- And I'm gonna win.
- Yeah.

214
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,127
- You should come with me.
- Huh.

215
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,544
Mayor's office next year.

216
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,463
Who knows where
five years from now.

217
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,325
Well, that's very generous
of you.

218
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:40,093
No, it's smart.
You saved my life.

219
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,832
That's a good story in politics.

220
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,638
And the best story usually wins.

221
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,349
You just do
the Nancy Reagan thing.

222
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,558
What?

223
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,728
All demure and dewy eyes.

224
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,230
Gazing up at me adoringly
the whole time

225
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,774
like I'm Mount Rushmore.

226
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,944
- Jedediah.
- Judge.

227
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,198
- Michael?
- Yeah.

228
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,659
There's a first.

229
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,329
My son taking the garbage out.

230
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,881
Hey. How was school?

231
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,885
You all right?

232
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,055
Adam.

233
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,351
Adam!

234
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,984
Adam.

235
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,195
Adam.

236
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,993
Hey. What the hell was that?

237
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,247
Oh, of course.

238
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,082
The anniversary.

239
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,461
Slow, contemplative music

240
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:28,219
You know, I-I was thinking
that I'd cook up

241
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,306
my dirty carbonara. Huh?

242
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,350
And then maybe...

243
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,353
maybe Shawshank one more time?

244
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:45,111
Or... we could go out.

245
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,410
What's wrong with your arm?

246
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,123
Adam.

247
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,543
Uh...

248
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,426
Something happened, Dad.

249
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,430
At school? What?

250
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,436
No.

251
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,606
I was driving,

252
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,442
and I couldn't get ahold of you.

253
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,402
Okay.

254
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,446
And?

255
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,532
I hit somebody.

256
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,836
- What do you mean?
- In another car?

257
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,455
- A motorcycle.
- Oh, Jesus.

258
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,623
Who?

259
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,585
Are they all right?

260
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,463
He died. I...

261
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,465
I think he died.

262
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:57,517
Oh, my God.

263
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,522
Wait, wait, wait.

264
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:03,982
Adam, you...

265
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,485
you think...
you-you think he died?

266
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,861
Is...

267
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,615
is that what...
is that what you saw, or...?

268
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:17,661
Adam.

269
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,156
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry.

270
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,540
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

271
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,335
Wh-Where did this happen?

272
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,215
- The Lower Ninth.
- Okay.

273
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,844
Okay, so that would be
the new hospital, then.

274
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,989
The ambulance
would've taken him to, what,

275
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,973
- New Orleans East, then, right?
- I-I don't know.

276
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,821
Well, the police
must have said something.

277
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,184
I-I drove away. I...

278
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:49,068
I drove away.

279
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,697
Adam, you drove away

280
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,949
- before the EMTs arrived?
- Well, I mean,

281
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,576
I-I tried to help him,

282
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,679
but I couldn't get him
to breathe and...

283
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,183
- So you-you called 911?
- I tried to.

284
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,182
- But, um... Dad.
- What do you mean "tried to"?

285
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,350
- Adam, is it yes or no?
- Please help me.

286
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,751
Please, Dad,
I-I couldn't breathe!

287
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:09,881
- I...
- Okay, okay.

288
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,591
I got you, buddy.

289
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,218
I got you.

290
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,478
So-so you...

291
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,813
you were driving.

292
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,650
And-and you couldn't
breathe, right?

293
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:34,322
And you were distressed, yeah?

294
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:37,575
His head, um...

295
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:41,287
His head must have...

296
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,624
There was so much blood,
but, um...

297
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,125
Okay. So this...

298
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:50,463
was a-a full-blown
asthma attack then?

299
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:53,091
Hmm?

300
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,592
Yeah.

301
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,553
Okay, and you grabbed
your inhaler to...?

302
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,722
I-I-I couldn't find it.

303
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,142
Okay, okay, so...

304
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,687
you couldn't breathe,
you-you weren't thinking,

305
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,231
and then the shock...

306
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,734
of what happened... but you,
you stopped, didn't you?

307
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,112
You stopped and you got
out of the car

308
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:18,533
and you tried to help him,
but then you panicked and...

309
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:21,244
Is that, is that right, Adam?

310
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,788
- Yeah.
- Okay, now listen to me.

311
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,332
Listen to me very carefully.

312
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,877
I love you...

313
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:33,631
more than anything
in this world.

314
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,511
And I promise you, it...

315
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,763
it's going to be all right.

316
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,475
Okay? Okay?

317
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,857
I...

318
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,859
- I killed somebody, Dad.
- I know.

319
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,611
- And I left him there.
- No. No, but...

320
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,114
But, Adam...

321
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,700
shock does strange things
to people.

322
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,925
No, no, no, no, listen,
no, listen to me.

323
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,913
When your mom died,
those first few hours

324
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,791
were just unbearable.

325
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,169
You howled and howled.

326
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,838
And I thought
it would never stop.

327
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,884
But then do you know
what happened?

328
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,720
You fell asleep.

329
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,807
Your body just shut itself down

330
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,935
so you could cope
with the shock.

331
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,021
And...

332
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,856
your head was on my arm.

333
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:36,694
And I lost all feeling in it,
but I couldn't move it,

334
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,988
because I was afraid
that if I did,

335
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,532
then you'd wake up

336
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,701
and...

337
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:47,205
you'd remember
that your mom had...

338
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,876
...that your mom...

339
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:55,254
wasn't alive anymore.

340
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:08,976
We're going to the
police station, aren't we?

341
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,604
Yeah.

342
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:24,116
Detective
Nancy Costello, please.

343
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:27,453
Yes, yes, it has to be her.

344
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,123
Um...

345
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,835
well, can you, can you get
a message to her?

346
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,129
I'm-I'm coming
into the precinct.

347
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,883
Uh... oh, uh, Michael Desiato.

348
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,469
D-E-S...

349
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:48,766
Yes... like the judge.

350
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,780
Dad...

351
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:06,409
can we bring Django
for the ride?

352
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,788
Sure.

353
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,628
Will you give me a minute?

354
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:28,723
Slow, contemplative music

355
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:06,052
Listen, if you get this
within the next 30 minutes,

356
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,792
will you please return my call?

357
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,638
No, just return my call anyway.

358
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:12,350
Adam... let me get him.

359
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,102
Come on, buddy, here we go.

360
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,646
Who were you calling?

361
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,899
That was Lee Delamere.

362
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:23,027
I want us to go in lawyered up.

363
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:25,029
Lawyered up?

364
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,405
Yeah.

365
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,785
I won't not do what's smart
just because it's my own son.

366
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,996
Are you okay?

367
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,623
Yeah.

368
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,583
Okay.

369
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,564
Will I get bail?

370
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:02,775
No.

371
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,027
Probably not.

372
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,949
New Orleans Parish Prison?

373
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,580
Yes.

374
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,969
Uh, don't forget
to give Django his meds.

375
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,641
I won't.

376
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,501
No, just... stay here.

377
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,129
Let me set this up.

378
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:46,128
Slow, tense music

379
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,168
dark, ominous music

380
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:41,976
Sir.

381
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,895
Excuse me, sir, can I help you?

382
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,106
Mike?

383
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,528
Get rid of the press.

384
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,488
Nothing gets out
till we're ready.

385
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,762
- Get back in the car.
- Wha... I-I thought that we had

386
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,480
- to go in.
- Get back in the car.

387
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,483
No, no, Dad, you were right.
I-I need...

388
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,989
Damn it. Will you just do
what I tell you to do.

389
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,177
Why are... You are the one that
said that we had to come here.

390
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:42,119
The boy you hit this morning
is Jimmy Baxter's son.

391
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:43,787
That's who you killed.

392
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:48,083
Jimmy Baxter is the head
of the most vicious crime family

393
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,794
in the history of this city.

394
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,089
Do you understand
what that means?

395
00:43:58,427 --> 00:43:59,845
Get in the car.

396
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,191
Quiet, pulsing music

397
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,960
Don't tell anyone.

398
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,087
Not ever.

399
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,549
I can do this.

400
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:23,429
I can keep you safe
if no one ever hears about it.

401
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,181
You understand?

402
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:30,769
Adam, this is
the rest of our lives.

403
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,573
The hit-and-run
has left a 17-year-old boy dead

404
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,533
in the Lower Ninth Ward today.

405
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,453
The victim has been identified
as Rocco Baxter,

406
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,487
who was riding a motorcycle
at the time of the accident.

407
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:52,541
The Baxter family is reputed

408
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,918
to have a long history
in organized crime.

409
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,546
Jimmy Baxter and his wife
had this to say

410
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,465
a few moments ago.

411
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,217
Uh, who would do
a thing like this?

412
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,344
Leave a dying child

413
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,097
on the roadside.

414
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:10,225
He was 17 years old.

415
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:13,312
What kind of a human being
are you?

416
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,273
Whoever you are...

417
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:21,153
...wherever you are...

418
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:25,073
...you should know...

419
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,160
you will be found.

420
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,723
Coming up, promising news...

421
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:36,210
suspenseful music

422
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,099
dramatic, pulsing music

423
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:32,409
Shit.

424
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,619
Oh, shit.

425
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,381
Ah...

426
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,845
On the bridge?

427
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:18,390
What the fuck?

428
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,683
On the bridge?

429
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:21,476
I-I... I had to.

430
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,770
You had to?

431
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:27,649
Prostate cancer.

432
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,526
When I need to go, I...

433
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,361
I need to go.

434
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,572
I'm-I'm so sorry.

435
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:36,241
What's your PSA?

436
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,661
It's... high.

437
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:42,205
Is it over a hundred?

438
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:47,252
It's 200.

439
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:52,549
I'm sorry, sir.

440
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:55,469
Look, uh...

441
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,304
good luck, okay?

442
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,556
And your fly.

443
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,227
Sorry.

444
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:52,752
Andy, do you hear that?

445

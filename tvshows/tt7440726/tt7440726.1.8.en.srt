1
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:05,296
Previously on Your Honor...

2
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:06,506
[Jimmy] I know your car

3
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,008
was stolen the day after

4
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:10,010
you killed my son.

5
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,094
Carlo!

6
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:12,512
He's about to be arrested

7
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,431
for the murder of Kofi Jones.

8
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:17,517
I can make sure
that he walks out a free man.

9
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,979
Stay away from the hotel.
Get away from the hotel!

10
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,540
- [siren wailing]
- [Nancy] Carlo Baxter,

11
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,204
- you're under arrest.
- [Carlo] For what?

12
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,876
[Nancy] You have the right
to remain silent.

13
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,086
[Fia] They're saying
that he killed someone.

14
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,862
- What?
- I didn't know who else

15
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:29,922
- to come to, and I...
- No, no, no.

16
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:32,157
It's-it's okay. I've got you.

17
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,534
The wrong brother died.

18
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,369
[Michael] Is he seeing anyone?

19
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,930
[Frannie] Did he tell you
that he has a girlfriend?

20
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:39,748
It's not really appropriate
for me to...

21
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,166
Oh, I'm sorry. You're right.

22
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,043
Look, I hate it
that we have to lie.

23
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,544
There's no choice.

24
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,379
Doesn't sound like love
to me, Frannie.

25
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,714
[Sarah]
I asked Molly to give you

26
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,215
the Carlo Baxter arraignment.

27
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:52,594
Uh, you need me.
You can't do this without me.

28
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,220
I didn't get it, did I?

29
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:57,140
Sarah LeBlanc will be trying
Carlo Baxter.

30
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,309
[siren toots]

31
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,478
[Nash] You been drinking?

32
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,396
Fuck you. Fuck the both of you.

33
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,231
Hands on the fucking wheel.

34
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,071
Jimmy.

35
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:13,823
[Jimmy] If you don't
come through for Carlo,

36
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,201
it would be the easiest thing
in the world

37
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,244
to cut your heart out

38
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,455
and feed it to the river.

39
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,669
Slow, suspenseful music

41
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:57,075
[Sarah]
It was a setup. I know it.

42
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,494
[Michael] I'm sorry, Sarah.

43
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,455
Did you see anyone at the bar?

44
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:08,253
White cops stop
Black person driving,

45
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,754
get lucky.

46
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,840
It happens.

47
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:21,141
[Sarah] Funny part is, I was on
my way to your surprise party.

48
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,767
I was

49
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,311
speeding so that I'd get there
ahead of you.

50
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,898
Did you talk
to your professional

51
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,441
responsibility lawyer?

52
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,777
[Sarah]
Mm-hmm. Rehab in exchange

53
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,988
for charges dropped

54
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,656
and arrest record expunged.

55
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,533
What do you think?

56
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,993
[chuckles softly]

57
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:42,704
I think
I don't have a drinking problem,

58
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,498
and I don't want
to lose the Baxter trial.

59
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,293
This is your career, Sarah.

60
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,669
[stammers]

61
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,671
An arrest is bad.

62
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,299
A felony conviction...
That's your judgeship.

63
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,677
They want me off this trial,
Michael.

64
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,053
- "They"?
- Oh, come on.

65
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,055
- Don't-don't do that.
- Don't do what?

66
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,557
You think
this city isn't capable

67
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,100
of connecting up all the dots?

68
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,144
Cops in bed with crime families

69
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,022
in bed with politics
in bed with cops.

70
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,690
It's an unvirtuous circle.

71
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,943
You lose your job,
you're off the case anyway.

72
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,487
Sarah, please,
you've got to be smart now.

73
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,364
I don't think
that D.A.'s got the balls

74
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:21,034
to actually prosecute
a sitting judge.

75
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,039
So you haven't seen it, then.

76
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,958
Seen what?

77
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,130
[sighs]

78
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,800
[Maxwell] I'm gonna need you

79
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,469
to take a field sobriety test,
ma'am.

80
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,554
You want me
to do the alphabet backwards?

81
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,515
Z, Y, X, W, go fuck yourself.
How's that?

82
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,517
- Come on. Turn around.
- You have got to be

83
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,078
- fucking crazy.
- Do I look like I'm crazy?

84
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,520
Hands behind your back.

85
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,606
It's gone viral.

86
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,819
Rehab.

87
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:02,283
Well, could be worse.

88
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:06,162
You know why I don't want
to lose the Baxter trial?

89
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,081
- Yes.
- You do?

90
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:11,084
Cops, crime families,
politicians.

91
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,420
You left out one group... judges.

92
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:18,258
The judges in this building
cannot be trusted.

93
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,386
- Am I right?
- Save one.

94
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,596
Stubborn bastard in court 14

95
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:28,434
who insists on putting justice
above everything.

96
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,231
[protesters]
No justice, no peace!

97
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,778
No justice, no peace!

98
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,947
No justice, no peace!

99
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,365
[Michael] There is

100
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,285
an existential threat
heading our way.

101
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,747
It wants in.

102
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,958
It wants to contaminate us.

103
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,628
And it is my job
to protect this courtroom

104
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,672
and everyone in it
the best I can.

105
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:01,301
So, lawyers, court staff

106
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:04,345
and family members
of the accused and the victim

107
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,307
are all allowed in the court.

108
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:10,268
Nobody else
without express permission.

109
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,896
We are having this courtroom
deep-cleaned every evening,

110
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,898
and I'm putting a man
on the door

111
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,027
so outsiders don't get in.

112
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,655
I do this with a heavy heart,

113
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,325
because excluding the press

114
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:29,454
and the public goes against
every principle

115
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:33,291
that I hold dear...

116
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,626
Transparency,

117
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:39,172
open justice, accountability.

118
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,973
[Fiona]
This is going to be upsetting.

119
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,641
I'm sorry
I have to show it to you.

120
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,727
I really wish I did not.

121
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:03,154
This trial is about...

122
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,615
what happened

123
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,575
in a prison cell
in the four minutes

124
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:12,121
between 9:11 and 9:15
on October 13

125
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,582
to turn this child...

126
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,838
...into this.

127
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,553
First rule in the rule book
of how to be a trial lawyer...

128
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,472
Don't get emotionally involved,

129
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,057
maintain
a professional distance.

130
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,309
Bullshit.

131
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,522
I am 100% emotionally involved

132
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,858
in getting this brute
of a human being convicted

133
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,195
of this murder. Why?

134
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,280
Because I know he did it.

135
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,742
I have proof

136
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:53,413
of Carlo Baxter's violent,
racist nature.

137
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:56,249
I can prove

138
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,167
that he had a clear motive

139
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,294
for killing Kofi Jones

140
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:04,632
and that he orchestrated
his one-night stay

141
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,552
in Orleans Parish Prison,

142
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,930
allowing himself the opportunity

143
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,933
to employ that violent nature

144
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,269
and act on that motive.

145
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,939
Nature, motive, opportunity.

146
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,406
- Can you stand up, Carlo?
- [Zander] Objection.

147
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,866
- She can't do that.
- Whatever.

148
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,201
Stand, don't stand,
doesn't matter.

149
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,787
Pretty soon, you guys are gonna
get a good look at Carlo Baxter,

150
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,456
whose defense is asking you

151
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:39,584
to believe
that he killed five-foot-seven,

152
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,545
40 pounds lighter, unarmed

153
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:45,173
Kofi Jones, because
he feared for his safety.

154
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,219
Okay, how do I know this?

155
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,638
Because he can't say
he wasn't there,

156
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,933
and he can't say it wasn't him,

157
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,644
because the evidence
supporting presence

158
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,022
and identity is
incontrovertible.

159
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,773
So what else can he say

160
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,485
about how Kofi Jones ended up
dead on a mortuary slab

161
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,779
after four minutes
in a cell with him?

162
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,157
Self-defense is all he's got.

163
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,494
Surprise, surprise,
that's what he's going with.

164
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,704
Call me a cynic.

165
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,589
Who is Carlo Baxter?

166
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,383
He's his father's son.

167
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,511
Who's his father?

168
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:37,183
[Jimmy] Don't go to the hotel.
Stay away from the hotel.

169
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,952
- Get away from the hotel!
- No, no. No, no, no.

170
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,436
- Objection.
- Turn that off, please.

171
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,689
- Go!
- Both of you, up here.

172
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,194
- Are you kidding me?
- What's the matter?

173
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,339
You don't like it when your
puppet master does the talking?

174
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,549
It's irrelevant, Your Honor.
What does this evidence tell us?

175
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,843
That the accused's father knew
he was about to get arrested

176
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,053
and tried to stop it
from happening.

177
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,453
And how does that help the jury?

178
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,555
By making them ask
a second question.

179
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,498
- Which is?
- How?

180
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,916
How did he know?

181
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,459
Is he a police officer? No.

182
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,961
How would Jimmy know?
Who told him?

183
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,647
- And how is this relevant?
- [Zander] Yeah.

184
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,382
Because if you kill someone
while defending yourself,

185
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,360
most people... most innocent
people... come forward

186
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,070
and say, "I'm really sorry
I killed someone."

187
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,947
[Zander] Is there an argument
in there somewhere?

188
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,198
[Fiona] "I had to do it or they
would have killed me first."

189
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,723
Not Carlo.
Not Carlo and his daddy.

190
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,725
Are we going to see evidence
to support this?

191
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,436
I'm asking the jury
to use their common sense.

192
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,522
Just lay it out for me, please.

193
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,315
[Fiona]
Jimmy Baxter is a gangster.

194
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,584
[Zander] That's what she wants.
They are not gangsters.

195
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,402
The Baxter family are gangsters.

196
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:32,071
They were tipped off
to Carlo's imminent arrest.

197
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,032
Tipped off by whom?

198
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,784
Slow, suspenseful music

199
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,036
[Fiona] We don't know... yet.

200
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,622
Maybe Johnny here can tell you.

201
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,016
[Zander] Okay, I'm not gonna
take that shit from her.

202
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,209
All right. Enough. Enough.

203
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,253
This is getting
way too personal.

204
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,422
I will not have this
in my courtroom.

205
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,757
Now, both of you, go sit down.

206
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,428
Ladies and gentlemen,

207
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:59,515
what you just heard...
The voice mail message...

208
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,434
You didn't.

209
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:04,437
I want you to un-hear it.

210
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,356
When I tell you

211
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,609
to disregard something,
take it from me,

212
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,111
there's good reason, and very
often it's not what you think.

213
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,613
So please don't speculate

214
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,615
because
you'll probably be wrong.

215
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,620
Let me do the work
on what should be the evidence.

216
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,831
Trust me, and we'll be fine.

217
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,754
[Zander] Home.

218
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,049
That's a hell of a word.

219
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,596
Shakespeare...

220
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,015
called it the most powerful word

221
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,517
in the English language.

222
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:49,482
It's a word I'm going to...
I'm going to ask you to think

223
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:52,276
very, very carefully about

224
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,445
during this trial.

225
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,665
Ten... by six.

226
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,169
That's it.

227
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,171
Inside OPP,

228
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,799
a man has ten feet by six feet

229
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,176
that he can call home.

230
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:22,264
Carlo Baxter was in his home
on the night of October 13th.

231
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,810
Home was his cell
at Orleans Parish Prison.

232
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,311
- [Fiona] Objection.
- Jesus.

233
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,914
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
I can't let this go.

234
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,189
This is my opening, Your Honor.

235
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,524
[Fiona] He knows

236
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,360
there's case law
specifically excluding

237
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,321
prison and jail cells
from the definition of "home"

238
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,049
- in self-defense cases.
- I'm not using the term

239
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,866
in a technical legal sense.

240
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,260
I'm appealing
to their common sense,

241
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,203
- Your Honor.
- It's misleading in law.

242
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,579
[Michael] But not in English.

243
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,164
So, continue, Mr. Zander.

244
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,666
[Zander] Thank you.

245
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,252
A killer walked into his home.

246
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,753
Lawyers have to be very careful

247
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,714
about every word we use
in court.

248
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,007
So when I say "killer,"

249
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,093
I mean...

250
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,219
"killer."

251
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,805
And we know this,

252
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,474
because, only days before,
he pleaded guilty

253
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,978
to causing the death
of Carlo's younger brother,

254
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,730
his baby brother,

255
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:11,897
Rocco...

256
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,233
...by hitting him with a car

257
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,027
and leaving him to die

258
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,821
by the side of the road.

259
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,751
What would you think
if you were Carlo?

260
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,128
Hmm?

261
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,757
You just arrived at OPP,

262
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,550
sat all alone in your cell,

263
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,760
minding your own business,

264
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,762
and suddenly,

265
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,430
out of nowhere...

266
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:48,267
Without a guard in sight,
mind you...

267
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,270
There's the killer
of your baby brother

268
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,064
just standing there,

269
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,108
looking right at you.

270
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,654
That's all you need.

271
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,783
Right there.

272
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,952
Who's the aggressor here?

273
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,120
Hmm?

274
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:13,083
Kofi Jones walked 300 yards

275
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,710
from his own cell block

276
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:18,798
and bribed a guard
to get to Carlo.

277
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:22,802
You know, every person has a
right to be safe in their home.

278
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,261
Everyone.

279
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,096
I'd like you
to think about that tonight

280
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,473
as you go to bed.

281
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,391
And God forbid

282
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,560
you ever wake up
to a known killer

283
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,729
standing in the room
you sleep in.

284
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,898
But if you do,

285
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,483
if you do,

286
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,652
I promise you this:

287
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:42,279
you won't need a law book

288
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,782
to spell out your rights.

289
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,497
We'll take five minutes.

290
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,500
Slow, gentle music

291
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,168
- Oh. Thank you.
- Here you go. Mm-hmm.

292
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,128
Note from the jury.

293
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,841
[paper rustling]

294
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,719
Who wrote this?

295
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,012
I found it in this envelope

296
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,306
lying on the table
in the jury room.

297
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,184
So it could have been
from any one of the 12?

298
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,019
Mm-hmm.

299
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,689
[Michael] Tell them I'll answer
it at the end of evidence.

300
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,691
[Betty] It's a done deal.

301
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:21,026
Carlo's going down.

302
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,864
[quietly] All right.

303
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,499
Lieutenant Cusack.

304
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,167
What about him?

305
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,545
[Lee] Interviewed Kofi
right after Nash and Maxwell

306
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,547
did what they did to him.

307
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,715
[Nancy] Huh.

308
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:43,716
They've been busy.

309
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,050
"They"?

310
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:47,136
Cusack's crew.

311
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:51,181
Nash and Maxwell
run with Cusack?

312
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,392
Cusack's Baxter-owned.

313
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:58,731
Are you saying that Jimmy Baxter
had LeBlanc removed?

314
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,735
Well, Judge LeBlanc hates
the Baxter family.

315
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,528
I mean, she's never tried
to hide it.

316
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,907
I mean, there's no judge
that they would want less

317
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,075
presiding over their case.

318
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,037
In the middle of the trial?

319
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,081
But how would it look
if something happened to me?

320
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:19,209
I mean, uh,
they-they-they wouldn't do that.

321
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,004
Ask Judge LeBlanc if she agrees.

322
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,882
Well, what evidence
have you got?

323
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,175
Lieutenant Cusack.

324
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,551
-His crew...

325
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:31,597
Lieutenant Cusack
is a prosecution witness.

326
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,516
He's going to be testifying
against Carlo Baxter.

327
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,018
So...

328
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,937
what you're saying about him,

329
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:41,607
uh, it just doesn't make
any sense.

330
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,278
Nancy...

331
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:52,826
...there's no public scrutiny
of what is going on in there.

332
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:57,456
So it's very important that
we don't stoop to speculation.

333
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,083
I mean,
we've got to be rigorous.

334
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,836
We've-we've got to be tough
on ourselves, right?

335
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,923
Evidence, evidence, evidence.

336
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,508
Right?

337
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,134
[sighs]

338
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,970
Yeah.

339
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,972
Have you...

340
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,182
been to Fiona McKee with this?

341
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,393
No.

342
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,478
Okay.

343
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,400
Tense music

344
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,009
Place your left hand
on the Bible.

345
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,927
Raise your right hand.

346
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,349
[breathing heavily]

347
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,851
Do you swear to tell the truth,

348
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,245
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth,

349
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,395
so help you God?

350
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,147
I do.

351
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,857
You may be seated.

352
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,027
It's easier for me to stand.

353
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,529
That's fine.

354
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,040
You know this man?

355
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,836
Yeah.

356
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,464
He, uh, jumped me on the street.

357
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,632
January, three years ago.

358
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,468
Why'd he do that?

359
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,304
For being there and being Black.

360
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,390
He broke my spine.

361
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,851
[quietly] Jesus.

362
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,895
[Justin]
They fused it, but, uh...

363
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,897
it didn't take.

364
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,399
At least not all the way.

365
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,818
That's why
I got no balance left.

366
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,404
- That's why this.
- [cane thumps]

367
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,908
[Fiona]
Anything else he do to you?

368
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,413
He curb-checked me.

369
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,250
[Fiona] Can you explain
to the jury what that means?

370
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,546
[inhales]

371
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,590
He made me, uh...

372
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,304
[exhales]

373
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,472
Sorry, I can't.

374
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,473
[Fiona] It's okay.

375
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,308
You don't have to.

376
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,061
Your Honor has
the agreed definition?

377
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:28,482
Yes.

378
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,611
[clears throat] "A form

379
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,280
of assault
in which the victim's mouth...

380
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,199
Jaw wide open...

381
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,618
Is forcefully placed on a curb

382
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,204
and the victim's head..."

383
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:48,210
"...is stomped from behind,

384
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,964
causing severe injury or death."

385
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,807
How did that affect you?

386
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,479
I wake up screaming
in the middle of the night.

387
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,567
I go to bed getting ready
to wake up screaming.

388
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,154
[Fiona] Thank you, Justin.

389
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:25,247
Uh, we'll take five minutes
before cross.

390
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,249
Slow, somber music

391
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,763
Mr. James,
thank you for your testimony.

392
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,432
I don't want to keep you
on the stand

393
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,184
any longer than is necessary,

394
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,645
and I'm sure Mr. Zander
feels exactly the same way.

395
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:52,482
I can't imagine what it
must be like for you to relive

396
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,860
your experience.

397
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,320
[quietly] Jesus. This judge.

398
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,779
Talk about pro-prosecution.

399
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,531
[Michael] I do have a question.

400
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,533
You have...

401
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,535
scarring from the attack.

402
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,370
- Is that true?
- Yes.

403
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,289
And from the surgeries?

404
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,415
Yes.

405
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,043
And they're on your back?

406
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,045
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

407
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,881
And the scar
on the side of your neck...

408
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,841
Is-is that also from the attack

409
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,718
or the surgeries?

410
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,179
Um, no, it's a...

411
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,014
it's a tattoo.

412
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,015
[Michael] Oh.

413
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,266
Sorry.

414
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,452
I couldn't make it out
from here.

415
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,727
My apologies.

416
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,438
Mr. Zander, are you ready?

417
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,945
Yes, Your Honor.

418
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,118
May I?

419
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,706
The letter "D."

420
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,458
Are you a member of a gang?

421
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,795
Objection. Justin James
is not the one on trial here.

422
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,506
I will allow this question.

423
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,594
"D" for...?

424
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,595
Desire.

425
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,847
[Zander] Desire.

426
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,619
Your Honor, may I have
the witness turn toward the jury

427
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,603
- so they can see the tattoo?
- Objection.

428
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,273
[Michael] I think,

429
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:17,526
under the circumstance,
it is a legitimate request.

430
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,278
I'll grant it.

431
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,783
[Zander] Desire.

432
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:29,788
Is that the same gang
that Kofi Jones was a member of?

433
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,623
Yeah.

434
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,167
[Zander] I'm guessing that
Carlo Baxter's not very popular

435
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,962
with the Desire crew
that you run with

436
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,630
and are loyal to.

437
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,173
Right?

438
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,177
No further questions,
Your Honor.

439
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:47,097
[Fiona] Redirect, Your Honor.

440
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,810
Carlo Baxter went to jail
for this vicious assault on you.

441
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:52,811
Right?

442
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:53,854
Yes, ma'am.

443
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,272
Did he plead guilty?

444
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,481
Uh, no.

445
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,358
There was a trial.

446
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,319
Who represented him?

447
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,404
That guy.

448
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,655
[Fiona] Oh.

449
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,282
Did you take the stand?

450
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,491
[Justin] Yes.

451
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,826
[Fiona]
Did Carlo take the stand?

452
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:08,827
Yes.

453
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,078
What did he say?

454
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,913
He said that I attacked him

455
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,290
and that he was defending
himself.

456
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,251
[Fiona]
Did he call any other witnesses?

457
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,753
Yeah.

458
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:18,920
His mother.

459
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,631
[Fiona] He was convicted

460
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,009
of the assault, correct?

461
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,010
Yes.

462
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,845
By a jury?

463
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,513
Yes.

464
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,849
So they believed you?

465
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,894
Yeah.

466
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,479
They did.

467
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,522
[Fiona] So it follows
that Carlo and his mother

468
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,358
- were lying under oath.
- Objection.

469
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,693
Speculation about what was
in the mind of the jury.

470
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,529
Mr. Baxter, you are a racist,

471
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,198
- a liar and a thug.
- Objection!

472
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,033
Ms. McKee.

473
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,037
Her Honor Judge LeBlanc's words

474
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,997
on sentencing Carlo Baxter.

475
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,752
Objection overruled.

476
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,879
[Fiona] Thank you, Mr. James.

477
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:27,572
[sighs]

478
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,244
low, ominous music

479
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:47,926
Did you forget where you parked?

480
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,305
No.

481
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,433
That's what I thought.

482
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,939
- Who are you?
- Detective Costello.

483
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,942
C-O-S-T-E-L-L-O.

484
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,362
[Brendan] C-U-S-A-C-K.

485
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,738
Cusack.

486
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,007
[Fiona]
What was Kofi Jones arrested for

487
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,616
on the night of October 10th?

488
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,285
Possession of a stolen vehicle.

489
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,370
And were those charges
later upgraded?

490
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,414
They were.

491
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,125
Vehicular homicide
for the hit-and-run death

492
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,294
of Rocco Baxter.

493
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,879
Carlo's brother.

494
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,130
[Brendan] That's right.

495
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,965
[Fiona] Thank you, Lieutenant.

496
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,138
You saw Kofi Jones
on the day of his arrest?

497
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,807
At the station house, yeah.

498
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,809
- Describe his demeanor.
- Uh, objection.

499
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,829
- It calls for speculation.
- He's a police officer.

500
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,646
Don't you read people
for a living?

501
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:44,608
Facial expressions,
body language and so forth?

502
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:45,984
Every cop does.

503
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,819
It's a crucial part of the job.

504
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,696
Overruled.

505
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,716
[Zander] I'm asking you
what you remember of Kofi Jones

506
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,450
on the day of his arrest.

507
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,219
We know he'd just run over
a 17-year-old boy, causing

508
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:58,038
- catastrophic brain injury.
- [Michael] We-we don't need

509
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,331
to hear the detail.

510
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,999
What, so we get
chapter and verse

511
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,876
on the curb stomp,
and you don't allow this?

512
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,504
Will you please get
to your point?

513
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,341
Did he seem torn up about it?

514
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,887
I'm not up here
to speak ill of the dead.

515
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,056
[Zander] You're up there
to tell the truth.

516
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,561
Okay. You really want to know?

517
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,981
He looked like
nothing had happened,

518
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:28,485
like it was
just another Tuesday.

519
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,362
I mean, when I saw him,

520
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,006
he'd just finished eating
a bacon sandwich.

521
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,700
You'd think, you just killed
a man, then...

522
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,119
suspenseful music

523
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,247
[Zander] No further questions.

524
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,512
[lively chatter]

525
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,183
I am so... so sorry
what's happening in there.

526
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,185
- It's not right.
- All that they're saying

527
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,396
about him ain't true.

528
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,356
I can drive you home.

529
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:10,777
For what? So you can bullshit me
some more on the way?

530
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,904
I-I could offer you
a place to stay.

531
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,323
- I mean, just-just until...
- I don't need that.

532
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,951
I don't need you.
I'm staying with Little Mo.

533
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:22,289
He making you feel like a man?

534
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,249
Like you have something?

535
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,917
He got my back.

536
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,545
You know, I used to plead out
corner boys all the time.

537
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,380
That was my job.

538
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,425
And every time
they'd sing the same song:

539
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,260
"My crew's got my back."

540
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,388
Then I'd tell them how many
years they were gonna do,

541
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,599
and I'd see it land.

542
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,852
Then they'd come back at me
and say, "I'm a good soldier.

543
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,103
I'm gonna take the years."

544
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,229
For what?

545
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,856
For feeling like a man?

546
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,691
You got something better for me?

547
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,360
I know the system.

548
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:55,447
I can navigate it for you.
With you.

549
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,872
Little Mo hand me cash
every week.

550
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:06,541
Every week.

551
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,960
And you want to hand me
the system?

552
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,797
[Eugene scoffs]

553
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,299
Fuck you!

554
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,509
Fuck me?

555
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,345
Fuck me? Really?

556
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,347
[laughs]
What, fuck me up the ass?

557
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,890
Is that you?

558
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,851
Are you the same as him?

559
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,646
Or are you better
than that, Eugene?

560
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,652
[Michael] One thing before
you go home for the night.

561
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:37,238
When you are outside
of this courtroom,

562
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,825
you do not talk to anyone
about this trial

563
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:44,162
or any testimony you hear
during it.

564
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:47,999
You do not watch,
read or listen to any coverage

565
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,001
on this case.

566
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,837
I want you clean.

567
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:56,925
I want you free
of outside interference.

568
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,927
And let me be clear.

569
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:02,722
Anyone breaking these rules is
committing a criminal offense,

570
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:06,518
and I will hold you in contempt
of court if you do it.

571
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,939
[stammers]

572
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,818
Why am I being so fierce
about this?

573
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,698
The answer is beside you.

574
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,040
Now...

575
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,668
I didn't put the Constitution
up on the wall.

576
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,878
It was there when I got here.

577
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,882
And it'll be here
long after I'm gone.

578
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:42,178
You know, sometimes I come in
early in the morning,

579
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,181
and I reread the words...

580
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,726
and remind myself
of the simple beauty

581
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:50,311
of our system of justice.

582
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:53,815
The accused has
the right to be tried

583
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:57,402
by a jury of his peers.

584
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:01,156
Now, notice it-it doesn't say
anything about judges...

585
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,032
or lawyers.

586
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:08,163
Our Founding Fathers knew
where to put their trust.

587
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:11,040
Now, I will tell you
what the law is.

588
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,209
But as for the facts...

589
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,379
Who's telling the truth,
who isn't...

590
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,590
It's all yours.

591
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,217
So despite me
being up here in...

592
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,969
all my...

593
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:27,474
Dumbledore gear, I am
far less important than you.

594
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,560
Because of this virus,
we're alone in here.

595
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,896
Nobody is watching you.

596
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:36,065
The responsibility
and the power is yours.

597
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,485
Not me. Not God.

598
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,904
You, the people.

599
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,950
I can't live on the kind of love

600
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,869
That you give...

601
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,955
D-Don't do that
with the stitching.

602
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,624
Why? What's it worth?

603
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:55,293
What's the story with that?
Where did Kofi get it?

604
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,253
What's it worth?

605
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,130
He didn't tell you
where he got it?

606
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:02,675
Nah. He didn't get the chance.

607
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,639
When was the last time
you saw him?

608
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,641
[sighs]

609
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,643
Hmm.

610
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,436
Last time I saw him was

611
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,480
the night before the cops came
and got him.

612
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,273
[clears throat]

613
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:21,110
Guess he didn't have it then...
The baseball.

614
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,446
Yeah, I guess not.

615
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,660
Sell it for me?

616
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,376
- Sure.
- Best closer

617
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,795
in the history
of the game right there.

618
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,380
Hmm.

619
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,842
Suspenseful music

620
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,274
[school bell ringing]

621
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,401
[indistinct,
overlapping chatter]

622
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,583
Adam, do you have a minute?

623
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,421
Uh, yeah.

624
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,399
It's the first picture you
showed me after your mom died.

625
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,133
You should have it.

626
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:14,057
I, um...
I gave my notice this morning.

627
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,100
What?

628
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,227
I'm gonna teach out the rest
of the semester,

629
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,313
and then I'm gone.

630
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,944
- I-I'm sorry.
- Why?

631
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,362
There are a hundred high schools

632
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:30,281
within an hour
of the NYU campus.

633
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,283
High schools? [chuckles]

634
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,744
I've put out some feelers
already.

635
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,287
Wait. Uh, are you...?

636
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,289
Adam, you'll be 18.
[chuckles softly]

637
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,291
We won't have
to hide from anybody

638
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,460
or explain ourselves
to anyone, you know?

639
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:46,297
We can just... we can just be.

640
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,557
I didn't get in.

641
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,353
NYU. They said no.

642
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,483
[door opens]

643
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,985
[barking]

644
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,487
Hey, buddy.

645
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,615
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

646
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:16,077
Look at this. Hey.

647
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,662
[sighs]

648
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,747
Adam?

649
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,840
All right.

650
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:34,178
[laughs softly]

651
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,390
Look at that. Huh?

652
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,225
You don't care.

653
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,731
Ah.

654
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,820
[sighs]

655
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:55,074
Charlie, cancel whatever plans

656
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,368
you've got for tonight.
We are celebrating.

657
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,703
Elizabeth?

658
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,830
Listen, uh...

659
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:04,000
The Desiato men
would love to see you tonight.

660
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,002
[Hurray for the Riff Raff's
"Settle" playing]

661
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:13,051
I didn't know.

662
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:16,471
Oh, it's not a big deal.

663
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,473
Kind of suits you.

664
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,517
Before I go to sleep

665
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:25,188
I listen long
to the bustling streets...

666
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,357
You know, Rocco never had
a girlfriend.

667
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,359
I mean, nobody he was

668
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,986
all in on.

669
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,405
Sometimes I feel like
I'm living two lives,

670
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,074
his and mine.

671
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,909
So, um, I hope you don't mind

672
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,661
having an annoying,
smiley, dead brother

673
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,872
hanging out with us
all the time.

674
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,875
They raised me up
on brick and bread...

675
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,126
[inhales]

676
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,128
Are you okay?

677
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,713
Hey.

678
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,257
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

679
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:56,094
How long

680
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,054
I'm gonna settle

681
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,265
Yeah, I want
to show you something.

682
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,934
I'm gonna settle...

683
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:05,037
So, my mom used to give people
pictures of themselves

684
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,437
they didn't know she'd taken.

685
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,123
I mean, all over the city,
there are people

686
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:11,025
with Polaroid pictures
of themselves taken by Mom.

687
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,194
And, you know,
people would get pissed

688
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,655
sometimes,
and so Mom would talk to them

689
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,949
or sometimes even go for coffee

690
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,700
with them
to try to persuade them

691
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,119
she wasn't after their souls.

692
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:25,373
And, I mean,
they would open up to her.

693
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,583
And I'd be there listening.

694
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,293
It was how I learned everything

695
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:32,004
that I know and love
about this city.

696
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:36,467
I mean, obviously
back then I hated it.

697
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:40,638
Thought she was, like,
embarrassing or...

698
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:45,643
And she knew that, so, um,
one day she explained it to me.

699
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,522
"Go deep, not wide."

700
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,483
She said people
make that mistake too often,

701
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:57,071
thinking that going deep
is going wide.

702
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,159
"Stay where you are,

703
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,077
stand still,

704
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,996
dig."

705
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,711
- Good?
- Perfect.

706
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,215
How much would you pay for this?

707
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,634
- Where'd you get that?
- Eugene.

708
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,220
Wants me to sell it for him.

709
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,264
So, he's talking
to you now, huh?

710
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,474
It's a process, but yes.

711
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,685
That's good. That's good.

712
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,312
- So, make me an offer.
- All right.

713
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,522
I'll make you an offer.

714
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,941
Here.

715
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,610
[laughs]

716
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:38,529
- Uh, Desiato. We're early.
- Come this way, please.

717
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,281
- Thank you.
- [hostess] Am I allowed

718
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,717
- to say something?
- [Michael] Sure.

719
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,701
You're the judge, right?

720
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,286
- Yeah.
- The Baxter boy.

721
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,872
So guilty. Tell me I'm wrong.

722
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,208
Well, I'm the last person
you should talk to about this.

723
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,668
- You can ask me.
- [hostess] So,

724
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,045
am I right?

725
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:56,547
We'll be leaving you
a very big tip.

726
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,924
Thank you, Mrs. Desiato.

727
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,717
Mrs. Desiato. Oh.

728
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,302
[Lee chuckles]

729
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,599
slow, sinister music

730
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,227
Right this way.

731
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,273
Here, Lee.

732
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:20,029
Well, I should wash up.

733
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,074
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

734
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,166
[Jimmy] Justin James.

735
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:37,380
Justin fucking James.

736
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,924
You didn't have to allow that.

737
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:43,219
You could have told her
she couldn't call him.

738
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,222
But now my boy's a racist.

739
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,765
She's tearing him apart
in there.

740
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,201
You don't know
what you're talking about.

741
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,768
And you're letting it
fucking happen!

742
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,603
I'm watching my son

743
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,106
- heading for death row.
- Do you have any idea

744
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,899
- what a jury is looking for
- Oh, don't...

745
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,609
In a judge on a case like this?

746
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,278
- Do you have any idea?
- Don't-don't...

747
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,613
- don't fuck with me.
- They want me to be their dad.

748
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,365
I am giving them that.

749
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,784
I am Gregory fucking Peck
in there.

750
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,744
They watch me

751
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,956
stand up
to Johnny Zander's showboating,

752
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,125
and they trust me more.

753
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:17,086
They watch me allow in evidence
that they really want to hear,

754
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,629
and they love me for that.

755
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,131
And all the while,

756
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:22,258
I am making them feel secure.

757
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,093
I'm making them feel safe

758
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,221
by telling them that I love them

759
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:31,058
and that I am not frightened
by anyone.

760
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,270
I get them to look up to me,

761
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,980
to take their cues from me.

762
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:39,317
And then later... not now,
not yet, but when it matters...

763
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:43,404
I tell them what to think.

764
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,739
They won't know
what's happening.

765
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,574
They won't ever
see it happening.

766
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,576
But it will happen.

767
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,494
Twelve of our peers

768
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:54,540
will do exactly what
I want them to do.

769
00:38:56,959 --> 00:39:00,838
Tomorrow or the next day,
I am making a move.

770
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,923
Now, are we done here?

771
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,345
Only number in here is mine.

772
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:12,475
I want to know what you've done
and when you've done it,

773
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:16,812
and I want it by 10 a.m.
the day after tomorrow.

774
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:21,233
Let's call that a deadline.

775
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,363
And let's give that word
its literal meaning.

776
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,324
Ominous, dramatic music

777
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,043
Thank you.

778
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,967
[Charlie]
And then she grabbed my head,

779
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,677
- and she said...
- [Lee laughs]

780
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,722
- She said, "It's in your heart."
- Ah.

781
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,225
- Hello.
- [Charlie] Hey! There she is!

782
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,852
- Ah, how are you?
- Hello, hello, hello.

783
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,229
[Charlie]
The woman of my dreams.

784
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,314
- And the man of mine. Hi.
- [chuckles]

785
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,400
- Ah. Mmm.
- Mmm.

786
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,068
[Elizabeth] Hey, baby.

787
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,864
- How you doing?
- Good.

788
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,409
- [Michael] Here you are.
- Thank you. Thank you.

789
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,954
- Sorry I'm a bit late.
- Oh, that's all right.

790
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,462
So, what's going on?

791
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:26,424
I mean,
is there something I don't know?

792
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:29,260
Hmm, maybe.

793
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:31,262
Here.

794
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,389
Open this.

795
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:45,067
You're going to NYU.

796
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,820
- [Elizabeth] He got in?
- [chuckles] He got in.

797
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,281
Six hundred applicants

798
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:52,450
for only five places. Wow.

799
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,326
Like mother, like son.

800
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,287
Huh? New York.

801
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,164
New life, huh?

802
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:01,250
[voice breaking]
Your mom would've been so proud.

803
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,628
- [laughter]
- [soft jazz playing]

804
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,630
Ah.

805
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:10,384
To New York and Adam.

806
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,428
Ah, to New York and Adam.

807
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,264
- Hear, hear.
- [Elizabeth] To Adam.

808
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,558
Yeah, um...

809
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,976
I-I don't know.

810
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,853
Don't know what?

811
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:25,357
I'm just... not sure.

812
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:28,319
About?

813
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,862
[chuckles softly]

814
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,198
Actually, I've been...

815
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,283
thinking
about taking a gap year.

816
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,498
Really?

817
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,001
Wow. Okay.

818
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:47,505
Um, s-so, you have a plan?

819
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:50,716
You're gonna travel abroad
or...?

820
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:54,303
I think that I should stay here.

821
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,681
And-and do...

822
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,517
do what?

823
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,602
What do you mean?

824
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:06,857
I think I should stay
in New Orleans.

825
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:09,318
Like Mom used to say,

826
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,029
go deep, not wide.

827
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:20,204
Adam, want a ride home
in a real car?

828
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,372
[all chuckle]

829
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:22,831
[Adam] Yeah.

830
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:26,210
- [Michael] Okay.
- They, they were here.

831
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,337
Who?

832
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,965
Jimmy Baxter
and his Celtic goon.

833
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,093
When?

834
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:37,054
As I arrived.

835
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,598
Well...

836
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,101
- It was a coincidence.
- Really?

837
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,727
How do you know that?

838
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:46,564
This is what happens, Elizabeth.

839
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:48,232
Paranoia sets in.

840
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,526
Irrational fear takes hold.

841
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,070
We can't have that.

842
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,905
That's the fight.

843
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:58,450
We have to stay normal.
We have to stay strong.

844
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:00,035
Okay?

845
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,370
Yeah.

846
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,497
Come on.

847
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,832
Push...

848
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:06,250
[Charlie] I love your father,

849
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,085
and I love you.

850
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,713
I'd do anything to protect you.

851
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,090
So that's why I-I don't like it

852
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:16,635
when I see something or someone
come between the two of you.

853
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,597
Push it

854
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,223
Pull it...

855
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:24,268
Girlfriend leaning on you
to stay, Adam? Is that it?

856
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,437
Girlfriend?

857
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:30,691
I'm your godfather,
not your father.

858
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,861
Well, godfathers get to talk
about girlfriends.

859
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:36,280
You're gonna get left...

860
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,782
- Okay. [chuckles softly]
- Come on.

861
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,492
Now go for yourself

862
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:42,286
It's easier taking candy
from a baby

863
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,829
[chuckles]

864
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,331
Don't hand me no bull

865
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:47,291
Now you got it, baby

866
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,336
[vehicle approaching]

867
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,604
[Michael] Ms. Latimer?

868
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,481
Frannie?

869
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:12,650
- Hi.
- [Frannie] Oh, Judge Desiato.

870
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,568
- Hi.
- Yeah, hi.

871
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,655
I'm sorry to sneak up on you,
but I-I did want to catch you

872
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:20,074
before school started.
It's about Adam.

873
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:21,408
Oh, yeah? Is he okay?

874
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,244
Yes. Yeah, he's... Well, he's...

875
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:27,498
[sighs] He's waffling on NYU.

876
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,958
Waffling?

877
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,836
Yeah, he's saying
that he might not want to go.

878
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:35,172
But he-he got the letter
and everything?

879
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,716
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, and the T-shirt, too.

880
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:42,179
Did he confide in you?
Did he say anything at all?

881
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,181
No. No.

882
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,725
Well, I know he trusts you,
doesn't he?

883
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,727
And you're not his parent,

884
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:50,354
so maybe you can get through
to him.

885
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:53,232
I mean, it's like you said,
he's got something.

886
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,487
I mean, he's only 17,
but he should know better.

887
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,824
And I'm worried that he's gonna
throw it all away.

888
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,538
I hate to ask, but...

889
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:10,374
would you talk to him?

890
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,543
Please?

891
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,546
Slow, dramatic music

892
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,005
- Sure.
- Yeah?

893
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,507
- Yeah.
- I...

894
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,967
Thank you.

895
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:21,385
- Okay.
- Thank you.

896
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,512
- I should, um...
- Yeah. Yeah.

897
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,597
- Have a good day.
- Okay.

898
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,310
Pulsing, dramatic music

899
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,958
[Dr. Edward Grether]
Massive trauma

900
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,461
causing multiple
brain contusions,

901
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:59,590
the result of blood
entering the brain tissue.

902
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:03,093
[Fiona] Can you tell the jury
what that looks like?

903
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,928
[Grether] Okay.

904
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,014
Um,

905
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,557
the deceased was, um...

906
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,142
You can call him Kofi.

907
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,144
Ms. McKee, please.

908
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,730
He's Kofi his whole life,
and then he gets killed

909
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,315
and suddenly
he's "the deceased"?

910
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:22,279
How did Kofi die?

911
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,281
Kofi's skull couldn't expand,

912
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:26,617
so his brain swelled up.

913
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:30,788
The pressure inside his skull
reached an intolerable level.

914
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:33,624
That pressure wasn't relieved.

915
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:36,001
It's a terrible way to go.

916
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,713
[Fiona] Exhibit B.

917
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:40,714
[Fiona clears throat]

918
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,132
[beep]

919
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:44,134
Now, Counselor,
we don't need to go here.

920
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:46,261
I just have
a few more photographs.

921
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,971
[Michael] I think the jury

922
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:49,324
has seen all
that they need to see.

923
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:52,810
[Fiona] Uh... may I approach?

924
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,775
Your Honor.

925
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,860
Right. Please turn this off.

926
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:06,323
I appreciate your concern
for the jury's feelings.

927
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:08,784
You've seen the photos?

928
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:12,788
Look, they're easy
for us to look at

929
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,540
because we're used to them.

930
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:17,793
But a jury? It's harrowing.

931
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,587
And we don't know how sensitive
they might be to these.

932
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:23,340
Do these injuries look
like they were caused

933
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:26,426
by someone defending themself?

934
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:28,345
I mean, even if the jury buys

935
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:31,014
that Carlo wasn't the aggressor,
they still have to decide

936
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:34,601
if the force he used to defend
himself was proportionate.

937
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:37,145
These pictures go directly
to the heart of that question.

938
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,540
They need to see them
to do their job.

939
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,607
- Come on, Fiona. It's overkill.
- Shut up.

940
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:44,027
And I need to protect my jury.

941
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,114
Let's continue.

942
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,999
[Fiona] Okay.

943
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,587
We don't have any pictures of
what happened to Kofi's brain.

944
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:04,548
So we're going to have
to use words.

945
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:08,594
His head was bashed
repeatedly against the wall.

946
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,470
[Fiona] How do you know?

947
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:12,556
[Grether] Small particles
I picked out of the wound,

948
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:15,517
some of which were embedded
in Kofi's skull...

949
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,561
They match the wall material
in the cell.

950
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,022
[Fiona] Stone from the wall

951
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,440
was in his skull?

952
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:23,150
[Grether] That's right.

953
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:25,277
Well, a skull is hard, right?

954
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,195
- [Grether] Very.
- So it would

955
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,989
- have required...
- A tremendous amount

956
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,782
of force to do
what was done here.

957
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,412
How many bashings?

958
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:36,914
Six.

959
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:43,545
And what can you tell us
about the force that was used?

960
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:47,591
Well, the, uh,
wall of the cell is flat.

961
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,927
There are no significant bumps
or ridges.

962
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:52,429
So, in order for particles
from the wall

963
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:53,931
to be embedded in Kofi's skull,

964
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:56,350
the force must
have been enough to...

965
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:59,811
to loosen the material
of the cell wall.

966
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,564
Which was?

967
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,066
Concrete.

968
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,068
He almost certainly had him
by the hair

969
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,737
- when he was...
- So, wait. Like... like that?

970
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:14,660
Like this? Like this?

971
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,454
Yes.

972
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,252
[banging continues]

973
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,380
slow, suspenseful music

974
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,886
[Grether]
I found Carlo Baxter's skin

975
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:36,139
under his fingernails.

976
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:38,266
[Fiona] What does that tell you?

977
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:42,104
Kofi fought for his life
and lost.

978
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:44,398
Thank you, Doctor.

979
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:49,486
[Michael] Mr. Zander?

980
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:51,655
[Zander]
No questions, Your Honor.

981
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,159
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you,

982
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:58,328
and we'll see you
in the morning.

983
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:23,603
[clicking mouse]

984
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:34,448
[phone buzzes]

985
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:22,245
[sighs]

986
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:41,932
No. No way.

987
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:43,308
Who reported me?

988
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,143
[Michael] That's confidential.

989
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:48,563
I'm not allowed
to know who accused me?

990
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,774
That's a habeas corpus suit
right there.

991
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,275
Was it juror eight?

992
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:54,152
I need to see your phone.

993
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:56,863
This is ridiculous.

994
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,698
Let's clear it up.

995
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:01,326
Fine.

996
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,161
Here you go.

997
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,687
Oh, my God.

998
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:32,357
That... that-that wasn't me.

999
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,861
Somebody did this to me.

1000
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,654
Why would they do that?

1001
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:40,615
Ms. Long, I don't doubt
that you had good intentions,

1002
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,660
but I gave
very clear instructions.

1003
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:46,621
[stammers] You're not listening.

1004
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,999
I didn't do this.

1005
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,126
Someone did this to me.

1006
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,716
What are you gonna do?

1007
00:52:57,757 --> 00:53:00,760
Replace you with an alternate.

1008
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:04,598
This isn't right.

1009
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,475
I could go out that door
right now

1010
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:08,995
and tell the press
what happened here.

1011
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,188
Sit down.

1012
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:18,028
The trial would collapse
if you did that.

1013
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:21,865
We'd have to start over
with a new jury.

1014
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:23,825
Justin James would have
to come back

1015
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:27,370
and relive the horror of being
curb-stomped all over again.

1016
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,625
I think we both know
what's going on here.

1017
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:35,754
I won't be intimidated
by anyone.

1018
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,594
Do you have children?

1019
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,388
A daughter.

1020
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,807
And you love her more
than anything in the world?

1021
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:53,188
What-what does she have
to do with...?

1022
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:56,775
[Michael] Nothing is
more precious than her.

1023
00:53:56,816 --> 00:54:01,780
Not principle, not courage,
not conscience.

1024
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:08,495
My guess is that you were
leaning toward

1025
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:10,914
convicting the accused.

1026
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,999
Hmm?

1027
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:16,878
Let me tell you something.
I have sat through

1028
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,006
hundreds and hundreds
of jury trials,

1029
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:24,052
and I can always call them
by the end of day one.

1030
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,263
I'm never wrong.

1031
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:31,351
Justice won't miss you,
Ms. Long.

1032
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:34,562
You can walk away,
and I would bet my life

1033
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:37,357
that we will still get
the result you want.

1034
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:40,485
Carlo Baxter is going down.

1035
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,904
Plaintive music

1036
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:49,452
Go home. Be with your daughter.

1037
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:51,955
Pretend this never happened.

1038
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:10,974
[indistinct chatter]

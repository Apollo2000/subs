3
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I don't usually do a live performance...

4
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,000
but, I did the movie with Baz...

5
00:01:19,035 --> 00:01:20,965
I did not see it.

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Oh, but you know the story.

7
00:01:23,035 --> 00:01:25,965
No. Not really.

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Oh, my god, "The Gift of the Magi"?

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,965
This is not gonna work...

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
They were supposed to cut it on the bias...

11
00:01:34,035 --> 00:01:35,965
You can't wear this.

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,965
Carola, non mi piace...
(Carola, I don't like it.)

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Di a Battistoni di rifarlo.
(Tell Battistoni to remake it.)

14
00:01:40,035 --> 00:01:42,000
Well, let me see what I can do here...

15
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,000
Turn this way.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Bueno, bueno! Andiamo!
(Good, good. Hurry up!)

17
00:01:49,035 --> 00:01:51,000
Anyway, "The Gift of the Magi"...

18
00:01:51,035 --> 00:01:52,965
It's a story by O. Henry...

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's about the foolish sacrifices
we make for love.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,965
Foolish, how?

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Well, in the story there are two
young lovers: Joe and Della...

22
00:02:04,035 --> 00:02:05,965
And they have no money...

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
They want so desperately to buy
each other a Christmas present...

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,965
I'm gonna try something...,

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
but I gotta pin it from underneath.

26
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:16,965
Okay.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So, Joe, the young man, he has only one possession:

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
his grandfather's gold pocket watch...

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Which he treasures more than anything...

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Except for Della.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Shall I go on?

32
00:02:51,035 --> 00:02:53,965
What?

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
With the story.

34
00:02:57,035 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes... please...

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
<i>L'Ennui</i>

36
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,965
Where have you been?

37
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I, um, I met these two kids, and, uh...

38
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
they lived in this little town called Bishop,

39
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:16,965
which is in the Sierras.

40
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,965
And, uh, it was so beautiful!

41
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I - there was this mountain called "Thunderbolt Peak"...

42
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And you know, of course, I could never
make it to the top of a mountain, right?

43
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You climbed a mountain?

44
00:04:31,035 --> 00:04:34,000
I - yeah.

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I got your letter, Jenny.

46
00:04:38,035 --> 00:04:41,000
Uh-huh.

47
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I never wanted you to rip your heart out...

48
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I just... wanted you to... be honest with me.

49
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yes.

50
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I have this present for you.

51
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,965
I found this in this, um...

52
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
little tiny town called "Lone Pine".

53
00:05:05,035 --> 00:05:08,000
It's like, it's a chain for your...

54
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,965
stopwatch.

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So you don't forget it all the time.

56
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I broke it.

57
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It was your grandfather's.

58
00:05:25,035 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah, it was.

59
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It was that day...

60
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So... that was... the first time that it happened?

62
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yes.

63
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,965
Those are yours.
Get out.

64
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You were screwing her since
the first night you went out!

65
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,965
Even Bette and Tina knew!

66
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I was the only idiot
who had no fucking clue!

67
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You pathological fucking liar!

68
00:06:19,035 --> 00:06:20,965
Get out of my house!

69
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Jenny, get out of my house!

70
00:06:23,035 --> 00:06:24,517
Go.

71
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:25,965
Okay.

72
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
No, no - okay.

73
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,965
And, like, that's it?

74
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You want us to ask, though...

75
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:50,965
So we're asking.

76
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Just 'cause she's squatty, and like...

77
00:06:53,035 --> 00:06:54,017
I'm not saying...
And like what?

78
00:06:54,052 --> 00:06:55,526
She's just short, guys, allright?

79
00:06:55,561 --> 00:06:57,000
There's nothing wrong with it...

80
00:06:57,035 --> 00:06:57,965
She's tiny.

81
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,965
Fucking Shane met Madonna
at Harry Samchuck's party!

82
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Madonna, la petite blonde qui chante?
(Madonna, the small blonde who sings?)

83
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:04,000
Yeah, so, does she want you?

84
00:07:04,035 --> 00:07:05,965
Did you already do her?

85
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Well, I am doing her hair next week.

86
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:07,965
Oh, my god.

87
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And Harry gave Shane his yacht.

88
00:07:11,035 --> 00:07:12,017
He gave you his yacht?

89
00:07:12,052 --> 00:07:12,965
Yeah. Friday night...

90
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm having a party,
so be there, okay?

91
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,017
Hi.

92
00:07:16,052 --> 00:07:16,965
Hi.

93
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Hi guys.

94
00:07:18,035 --> 00:07:19,017
Hey!

95
00:07:19,052 --> 00:07:19,965
Hello.

96
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
How are you doing?

97
00:07:21,035 --> 00:07:21,965
Good, how are you?

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Here's a chair for you.

99
00:07:24,035 --> 00:07:25,965
Oh... thanks baby.

100
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So Tina, how do you feel?

101
00:07:28,035 --> 00:07:29,965
Oh, my god, you guys...

102
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You wouldn't believe it...
My acid indigestion is so much better...

103
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,517
since Doctor Wilson prescribed the antacid!

104
00:07:34,552 --> 00:07:37,000
The tablets are a lot better than the liquid.

105
00:07:37,035 --> 00:07:37,965
Yeah. Much better.

106
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,500
But last night,
I woke up at 3 AM...,

107
00:07:40,535 --> 00:07:43,000
with the most
unbelievable heartburn.

108
00:07:43,035 --> 00:07:44,965
My HCD levels are really high,

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
which can be a good thing in a pregnancy,...

110
00:07:47,035 --> 00:07:49,965
but it makes nausea so much worse.

111
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Well, it's supposed to subside after 14 weeks...

112
00:07:52,035 --> 00:07:54,017
This morning, I am pulling on my socks...

113
00:07:54,052 --> 00:07:56,000
...and I noticed this varicose vein.

114
00:07:56,035 --> 00:07:56,965
Right there.
Oh, there it is.

115
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah, well, if she keeps doing her prenatal yoga...

116
00:07:59,035 --> 00:08:00,965
and the pelvic floor exercises...

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's because of the increase
in hormone production...

118
00:08:03,035 --> 00:08:05,965
that the muscular walls of the veins relax.

119
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's unbelievable what the
female body goes through!

120
00:08:08,035 --> 00:08:09,517
Which reminds me, today is...

121
00:08:09,552 --> 00:08:11,000
our ceremony in spirit flow.

122
00:08:11,035 --> 00:08:12,965
What ceremony?

123
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,965
You don't remember?
We told you about it.

124
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The Sikhs believe that the
soul enters the fetus' body at 13 weeks.

125
00:08:17,035 --> 00:08:20,000
Cool.

126
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And Gurudev, my yoga
teacher, she does this ritual,

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
and we were just hoping that you guys
would be there for the chanting...

128
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:31,517
And, uh, there's gonna be a blessing.

129
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,000
No, we - we wouldn't miss it. Wouldn't.

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,500
Absolutely not.

131
00:08:38,535 --> 00:08:41,000
That's great.

132
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Ohmmmmmmm... Ohmmmmmmm...

133
00:09:07,035 --> 00:09:07,965
Ohmmmmm my god...

134
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Now, if you'll all join me in singing:
"May the Longtime Sun"...

135
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
and remember to send your blessings
to Tina and Bette...

136
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
...and the new being they're creating.

137
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:24,000
"May the longtime sun shine upon you... "

138
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
"All love surround you... "

139
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
"And the pure light within you... "

140
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
"Guide your way home... "

141
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
"May the longtime sun shine upon you... "

142
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What happened to you?

143
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,965
I know that you, um...

144
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
don't want to talk to me
after what I said to you.

145
00:10:30,035 --> 00:10:33,000
What do you need, Jenny?

146
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I need a bath.

147
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Can I go to your house?

148
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,965
I can... wait for your break...

149
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I thought you never wanted to see me again?

150
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
We were together for four years...

151
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
We were engaged.

152
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I just had to try to
make things work.

153
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
He really loves you.

154
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
He came to show me.

155
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,500
Tim did that to you?

156
00:11:18,535 --> 00:11:19,965
Yes. But don't worry,

157
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm not gonna press charges...

158
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Am I just a coward...

159
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
and a liar...

160
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
and a cheater?

161
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Adios, chiquitas. (Bye girls.)

162
00:12:09,035 --> 00:12:09,965
Oh, bye baby.

163
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
See you guys later.

164
00:12:11,035 --> 00:12:12,017
A plus tard.

165
00:12:12,052 --> 00:12:13,026
Bye, Kit!

166
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:13,965
See you guys!

167
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,965
Bye.
See you later!

168
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So, tell us again about this crazy party on the boat?

169
00:12:18,035 --> 00:12:19,965
Oh. Allright...

170
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,965
Harry booked it, right?

171
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
But it turns out he has to go out of town...

172
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:23,965
So...

173
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,965
there's a free bar...

174
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
there are very sweet cocktail waitresses...

175
00:12:29,035 --> 00:12:30,000
hey, it could be tit, y'know?

176
00:12:30,035 --> 00:12:31,965
Yeah. I'm sure.

177
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,965
I'm sure it will be tit.

178
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,500
And I'm sure you will completely...

179
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:37,767
understand why we won't be there.

180
00:12:37,802 --> 00:12:40,000
That's too bad,
you're missing out.

181
00:12:40,035 --> 00:12:41,965
I'm nesting,
you guys...

182
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I wish I could
describe what it feels like...

183
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,965
It's... it's...

184
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's okay, we can use our imaginations, really.

185
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:49,965
Primal!

186
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Females in the animal kingdom,...

187
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:54,000
they do this when they're gestating.

188
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:55,017
You become a homebody.

189
00:12:55,052 --> 00:12:56,526
You just... retreat!

190
00:12:56,561 --> 00:12:57,965
Like a brooding hen.

191
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So you guys are gonna pass up
a private girl party on

192
00:13:01,035 --> 00:13:04,000
the most famous gin palace in the Pacific...

193
00:13:04,035 --> 00:13:05,000
so you can go home and sit on an egg...

194
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,965
is this what I'm hearing?

195
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yes! That is what you're hearing Alice.

196
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:10,965
Yes we are.

197
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I gotta get back to work, you guys.

198
00:13:12,035 --> 00:13:12,965
Bye.

199
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Thanks for coming.

200
00:13:14,035 --> 00:13:15,000
Allright. Okay.

201
00:13:15,035 --> 00:13:15,965
Bye.

202
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,965
Okay. Um.

203
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,965
It was lovely.

204
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah, congratulations, you guys!

205
00:13:19,035 --> 00:13:20,517
And quite moving.

206
00:13:20,552 --> 00:13:21,965
It was really pretty.

207
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,500
It's so desperate, you guys...

208
00:13:23,535 --> 00:13:25,000
we have to go ahead and do this.

209
00:13:25,035 --> 00:13:25,965
Yeah.

210
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Six o'clock.

211
00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:27,965
Six.
Okay.

212
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Allright, we'll see ya later.

213
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,965
Sorry I'm so late, sweetie!

214
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,965
I was just pulling out of the garage when I realized...

215
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
that I forgot the three new natural childbirth books we wa...

216
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,500
What's going on?

217
00:13:57,535 --> 00:13:58,965
I don't know..

218
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
These guys have something they want to talk to us about.

219
00:14:02,035 --> 00:14:04,000
Maybe you should have a seat next to Tina?

220
00:14:04,035 --> 00:14:04,965
Um, can I just...

221
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
No, no, no. No. I have it.

222
00:14:08,035 --> 00:14:09,965
Okay...

223
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,965
Okay. Yeah? Yeah.

224
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Uh - Shane? Will you put that in the fridge?

225
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:14,517
'Cause leaving hot food out is...

226
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:16,776
what brings the bacteria to life...

227
00:14:16,811 --> 00:14:19,000
And toxoplasmosis is one of the most...

228
00:14:19,035 --> 00:14:20,517
prevalent causes of birth defects.

229
00:14:20,552 --> 00:14:22,000
You get it from contaminated food,...

230
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:24,000
unpasteurized cheese, and...

231
00:14:24,035 --> 00:14:25,017
Cats.

232
00:14:25,052 --> 00:14:25,965
Cats.

233
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,965
Outdoor cats.

234
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Slander against cats...

235
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:28,965
Write that down.

236
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Wh - What are you writing, anyway?

237
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,965
Okay. Here goes.

238
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The reason we've gathered here...

239
00:14:37,035 --> 00:14:38,965
your friends and family...

240
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,500
because we really do consider you guys our family.

241
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:44,000
That's why we were at that... ritual... thing.

242
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,965
Is to perform an intervention.

243
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Look, guys, my cousins did this for my uncle Bill

244
00:14:51,035 --> 00:14:52,965
and he hasn't had a drop to drink...

245
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
since they put him in the straightjacket...

246
00:14:54,035 --> 00:14:55,000
and hauled him off to rehab...

247
00:14:55,035 --> 00:14:55,965
I swear.

248
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Thank you for that, Shane.

249
00:14:57,035 --> 00:14:59,965
Sure.

250
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Now. I know what you're thinkin'.

251
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:02,965
Well that is a relief...

252
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
because I can safely say that
we're both just totally mystified!

253
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:08,000
An intervention is about helping people you love...

254
00:15:08,035 --> 00:15:11,000
change destructive patterns of behavior.

255
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,000
Now, over the past approximately...

256
00:15:13,035 --> 00:15:14,017
Twelve.

257
00:15:14,052 --> 00:15:14,965
Twelve...

258
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
...weeks, we've noticed a very alarming pattern.

259
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Um. You two are having a baby...

260
00:15:21,035 --> 00:15:23,000
And we are very happy for you.

261
00:15:23,035 --> 00:15:24,965
Why wouldn't you be?

262
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,965
We are.
Jump in anytime.

263
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Okay. Um. Guys. We've seen this happen
with other couples that we've known...

264
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Janet and Sue, for instance...

265
00:15:33,035 --> 00:15:34,965
Claudia and Tammy, oh...

266
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
god, especially Mimi and Ivy. Wow.

267
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Um. It would kill us, you guys,
if you wound up like Mimi and Ivy.

268
00:15:42,035 --> 00:15:45,000
Okay. And we wouldn't be your friends if we just stood back and...

269
00:15:45,035 --> 00:15:46,517
let ya...

270
00:15:46,552 --> 00:15:48,276
get so...

271
00:15:48,311 --> 00:15:49,655
So...

272
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,345
What!

273
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,965
Boring.

274
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Boring, guys.

275
00:15:56,035 --> 00:15:57,017
Boring?

276
00:15:57,052 --> 00:15:57,965
Boring?

277
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,500
I know this is painful...

278
00:15:59,535 --> 00:16:01,000
Denial is very common...

279
00:16:01,035 --> 00:16:01,965
It's okay.

280
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
That's why we've actually made this list of incidents,...

281
00:16:05,035 --> 00:16:08,000
and this multiple choice self assessment test.

282
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,965
Which we'll go through with you...

283
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
...and then the two of you can fill it out together,...

284
00:16:13,035 --> 00:16:15,000
and tally the results.

285
00:16:15,035 --> 00:16:15,965
It has results?

286
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Results you can... tally?

287
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Jesus!
Ready?

288
00:16:23,035 --> 00:16:23,965
No, but go ahead.

289
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
"Wednesday, March 5. TK arrives at The Planet
with a catalog of maternity underwear,...

290
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and takes up the entire breakfast
making everyone choose between...

291
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Pima Cotton granny panties and wide-waistband
stretch-lycra maternity briefs. "

292
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,500
I'm sure I did that, but...

293
00:16:39,535 --> 00:16:40,965
I needed you to help me.

294
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Acceptance is the first step, Tina. Dana?

295
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:43,965
Right.

296
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,965
Um, Tina, this one's for you...

297
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
From the questionnaire:And appropriate
response to the question...

298
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,500
"Hi, how are ya?" is?

299
00:16:53,535 --> 00:16:55,965
I don't know. "A".

300
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,965
"A"! "Fine thanks, and you?"

301
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,965
Uh, "B", which also would have been good,...

302
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
"I'm feeling a little tired today,
but I'm really happy to see you guys. "

303
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But "C"? Shane?

304
00:17:08,035 --> 00:17:08,965
Oh.

305
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,965
Yep, um, "C", being,...

306
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,965
"I'm taking progesterone suppositories...

307
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
and my vaginal discharge is all gooey and brownish,...

308
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,000
and my gums are spongy and bleeding from the hormones...

309
00:17:18,035 --> 00:17:21,000
and extra blood coursing through my body. "

310
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Bette? I don't want you to think this is just about Tina.

311
00:17:26,035 --> 00:17:26,965
No, I'm sure.

312
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,965
Bored the hell out of you.

313
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Look, guys, we love you so much.

314
00:17:30,035 --> 00:17:33,000
We love you guys. We do.

315
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:35,965
Ditto.
Love you.

316
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
That's why it pains us so much to see you...

317
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:38,965
in this downward spiral.

318
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I mean, Tina?
Look at your feet.

319
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,965
What?

320
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,965
Oh, look, right here it says,...

321
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
"True/False. Right now, I am wearing fuzzy-wuzzy slippers. "

322
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Allright. That's it.

323
00:18:03,035 --> 00:18:04,017
Okay. Allright.

324
00:18:04,052 --> 00:18:04,965
Okay. Great.

325
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,965
So, uh... m aybe leave some copies...

326
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Here... Yeah, we'll give you some
extras in case you mess up.

327
00:18:11,035 --> 00:18:11,965
See ya.

328
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Okay, bye-bye.

329
00:18:14,035 --> 00:18:16,000
Bye, guys.

330
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You're not bored by your mommies, are you?

331
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
He's not.

332
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Hola! (Hello!)

333
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,965
Oh, wait a minute, can you hold on?

334
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Can you hold on a minute? Just one minute!

335
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,965
Hi! Yeah.

336
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,965
Yeah, this is me.

337
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,965
It's kind of a whistle-stop tour...

338
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm looking at Washington U. tomorrow...

339
00:19:09,035 --> 00:19:11,000
then I'm off to L.A. the following day...

340
00:19:11,035 --> 00:19:14,000
I've been offered a place at USC.

341
00:19:14,035 --> 00:19:14,965
An internship.

342
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,965
Look, anyways,what I was thinking...

343
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,965
look, I'm in interviews most of the afternoon...

344
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And then I'm catching an evening flight back to D.C....

345
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,000
You know, but I thought maybe...

346
00:19:24,035 --> 00:19:26,017
maybe we could meet.

347
00:19:26,052 --> 00:19:27,965
<i>Before I leave. </i>

348
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
<i>I - I realize you're not</i>
<i>supposed to put yourself in... </i>

349
00:19:31,035 --> 00:19:33,517
...you know, stressful situations...

350
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:35,965
at this stage in the recovery process...

351
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
and... look, I - I want to be respectful of that.

352
00:19:39,035 --> 00:19:40,017
No...

353
00:19:40,052 --> 00:19:40,965
I'm okay.

354
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,500
I can handle it. Okay?

355
00:19:43,535 --> 00:19:45,965
I'll see you then.

356
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And that's pretty much it.
Until they release the campaign.

357
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,965
You look fucking hot...

358
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You should dress like that more often.

359
00:19:54,035 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm going to a party later.

360
00:19:56,035 --> 00:19:57,965
Great.

361
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,965
That reminds me of one thing, actually.

362
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Um... usually in a contract like this, there's, uh,...

363
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,965
something called a Lifestyle Clause, okay,...

364
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
in which you as the spokesperson are expected to, uh,

365
00:20:09,035 --> 00:20:12,000
reflect the company's image, y'know,...

366
00:20:12,035 --> 00:20:12,965
in all aspects of your life.

367
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It can be stupid things like no...

368
00:20:15,035 --> 00:20:16,517
no public drunkenness,...

369
00:20:16,552 --> 00:20:18,276
or, uh, I don't know...

370
00:20:18,311 --> 00:20:20,655
No Satan worshipping.

371
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,965
This is the deal.

372
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,500
Once you sign this thing...

373
00:20:24,535 --> 00:20:25,965
Subaru owns your ass...

374
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You've gotta play by their rules.

375
00:20:27,035 --> 00:20:27,965
What about Martina?

376
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yeah. Yeah, I know that Subaru did
that whole Martina-lifestyle campaign,...

377
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,500
but that's - that's different,...

378
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:36,965
'cause Martina, she's a superstar...

379
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You know, she can pull off that whole,...

380
00:20:39,035 --> 00:20:39,965
the whole gay thing.

381
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,500
You're not Martina, babe...

382
00:20:41,535 --> 00:20:42,965
You're not Tiger Woods...

383
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You're - you're not a superstar.

384
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:47,000
What you are is very hot.

385
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,965
Very sexy. This is it.

386
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,965
This is your chance to cash in!

387
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
But you've gotta face the facts, Dana...

388
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:55,965
The clock's ticking...

389
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You know, you're, uh... your Anna
Kournikova days are numbered.

390
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Fuck you, Conrad!

391
00:21:02,035 --> 00:21:02,965
Hey, I've offered.

392
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Oh. Lighten up, Fairbanks, c'mon.

393
00:21:05,035 --> 00:21:07,517
You can be a lez when you retire...

394
00:21:07,552 --> 00:21:10,000
But right now, you're an ass-kicking...

395
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,517
but... dick-lovin'... athlete.

396
00:21:12,552 --> 00:21:14,965
Who's getting a fat paycheck.

397
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
All you gotta do is smile pretty for the camera...

398
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:19,000
Capisce? (Understand?)

399
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Hey ladies, how you doin'?

400
00:21:29,035 --> 00:21:30,965
Good.
Names, please?

401
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,965
Bette Porter and Tina Kennard.

402
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Bette and Tina. There you go. Uh,
Shane's not here yet...

403
00:21:35,035 --> 00:21:35,965
But you can go on board,...

404
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
make yourselves feel comfortable.

405
00:21:37,035 --> 00:21:37,965
Thanks.

406
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,965
Okay. Thanks.

407
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Actually, you're the first two to arrive.

408
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,500
Uh-oh. We're the first ones here?

409
00:21:45,535 --> 00:21:47,000
That's really boring, isn't it?

410
00:21:47,035 --> 00:21:49,017
That's boring.

411
00:21:49,052 --> 00:21:51,000
So boring.

412
00:21:51,035 --> 00:21:53,965
God.

413
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
This is so nice.

414
00:21:56,035 --> 00:21:57,965
It is.

415
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And so peaceful.

416
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Bor-ing!

417
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,500
So you still haven't told me...

418
00:23:34,535 --> 00:23:37,000
What do you think counts as sex?

419
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,500
I don't know...

420
00:23:44,535 --> 00:23:47,000
Having an orgasm?

421
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,965
Well, if that was the case,...

422
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
that would mean thousands of women who are...

423
00:23:51,035 --> 00:23:53,000
married with children have never had sex.

424
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,965
But either way...

425
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
you and I definitely have had sex!

426
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
You're so sexy, Dana...

427
00:24:04,035 --> 00:24:06,000
You make me come so hard.

428
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
What, did I offend you or something?

429
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:17,000
No, everything's fine.

430
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,965
Dana, what's up?

431
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Just, I need you to stop.

432
00:24:23,035 --> 00:24:23,965
Stop what?

433
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,500
Touching me. Kissing me...

434
00:24:26,535 --> 00:24:28,267
I can't do this, okay?...

435
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm not ready for all this.

436
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,965
I don't believe you...

437
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I don't think I've ever met anyone
more ready in my entire life!

438
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I know...

439
00:24:37,035 --> 00:24:37,965
I'm gay...

440
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And when I hide that,
I hide the best part of me...

441
00:24:41,035 --> 00:24:44,000
But you don't understand
what it means to be me...

442
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,965
My clock is ticking, Lara, and...

443
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
and you want to have sex in the street.

444
00:24:52,035 --> 00:24:52,965
What? I...

445
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And I don't want to parade around making...

446
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:56,000
sure everybody knows our business...

447
00:24:56,035 --> 00:24:58,017
I'm not like you...

448
00:24:58,052 --> 00:24:59,965
I care what they think.

449
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,500
Is this about the ad campaign, or something?

450
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:05,000
Did your agent scare the shit out of you?

451
00:25:05,035 --> 00:25:07,965
It's just, I can't...

452
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,500
stand to be judged by you all the time.

453
00:25:09,535 --> 00:25:11,000
You're a bigger, better person than me...

454
00:25:11,035 --> 00:25:13,000
and every time I look at you...

455
00:25:13,035 --> 00:25:15,000
I'm reminded of that!

456
00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:15,965
I'm sorry...

457
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,500
I've been putting too much pressure

458
00:25:17,535 --> 00:25:19,000
on you and I'm moving too fast...

459
00:25:19,035 --> 00:25:22,000
peut-ךtre qu'on devrait...

460
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Maybe we should just...

461
00:25:29,035 --> 00:25:29,965
No!

462
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,965
I just, I ca...

463
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I can't! Okay?! Just forget it!

464
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I can't. It's too hard.

465
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I don't want to be with you.

466
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
What were you doing last night around 9:15?

467
00:26:03,035 --> 00:26:04,965
I don't know. Um...

468
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I think brushing my teeth!

469
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,965
Did you feel anything?

470
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Because I was sending you Reiki.

471
00:26:13,035 --> 00:26:15,000
Oh, my god. Did you say 9:15?

472
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Reiki, isn't that boring?

473
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,965
Really boring. Write it down.

474
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,965
You're under so much stress
right now with...

475
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
everything that's going on with
your mother and your siblings...

476
00:26:26,035 --> 00:26:29,000
If you want, I could do some
hands on with you later tonight.

477
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,965
I would love that...

478
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I would really love that.

479
00:26:34,035 --> 00:26:35,965
I actually, I have this...

480
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I - I don't know if you can feel this...

481
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,965
Yeah.

482
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Can you feel that?
Yeah.

483
00:26:45,035 --> 00:26:47,000
it's definitely... blocked.

484
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Hold on a moment?

485
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Hey, hey, hey.

486
00:27:02,035 --> 00:27:03,965
Hey.

487
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,500
Where's your woman?

488
00:27:05,535 --> 00:27:07,000
She couldn't make it.

489
00:27:07,035 --> 00:27:08,965
That sucks.

490
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Are you allright?

491
00:27:11,035 --> 00:27:13,000
Yeah, I'm fine.

492
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,965
You feeling that?

493
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

494
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I'm working telepathically
on your glutes right now.

495
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,965
Right.

496
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
You're carrying a lot of
stress in your lower back...

497
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,965
and hips.

498
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Right now... I'm releasing it.

499
00:27:37,035 --> 00:27:40,000
Okay.

500
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,500
Now take your shirt off...

501
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:50,965
I think it might help.

502
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, sure, of course.
If you think it'll help.

503
00:27:54,035 --> 00:27:57,000
Okay.

504
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Are you ready?

505
00:28:04,035 --> 00:28:04,965
Ready.

506
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Allright. Cheers.

507
00:28:06,035 --> 00:28:09,000
Cheers.

508
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
One more. One more. One more. One more...

509
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,965
One more?

510
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Yes. One more!

511
00:28:34,035 --> 00:28:34,965
We ready?

512
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Ready? Allright. Once again.
Go.

513
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Fabulous! Okay.

514
00:28:43,035 --> 00:28:46,000
Whoo!

515
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,965
Wait.

516
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,500
What... what?

517
00:29:25,535 --> 00:29:28,000
I have something.

518
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,500
You're kidding, right?

519
00:29:36,535 --> 00:29:38,000
Why would I be kidding?

520
00:29:38,035 --> 00:29:40,017
Well... because...

521
00:29:40,052 --> 00:29:41,965
you're a man...

522
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Y'know? You got the real thing.

523
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
That's not... that's not how I want to make love to you.

524
00:29:49,035 --> 00:29:51,517
That's how I want you to, okay?

525
00:29:51,552 --> 00:29:54,000
But it goes against who I am.

526
00:29:54,035 --> 00:29:56,017
Listen. You're a man...

527
00:29:56,052 --> 00:29:58,526
You're a man named Lisa,...

528
00:29:58,561 --> 00:30:01,000
but you're definitely a man.

529
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I'm a lesbian... man...

530
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Dana's really gettin' down with
her bad self.

531
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Yeah, and I bet her bad self's
gonna feel real bad in the morning.

532
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
How are you holding up?

533
00:30:41,035 --> 00:30:42,965
Mm, not so good...

534
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I'm on the 12-step program for people
who are addicted to domesticity.

535
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Oh, my god.

536
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
What? What's the matter? What?

537
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I - no, no, no...

538
00:31:28,035 --> 00:31:29,000
No, don't do this.!

539
00:31:29,035 --> 00:31:29,965
What...

540
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
What... but you... you had a good time!

541
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,965
Here. Quick...

542
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,500
Slip under my cloak of boringness...

543
00:31:41,535 --> 00:31:44,000
No one will even notice we're gone.

544
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,965
Hang in there. I got you.

545
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Awww. Baby, let it out, let it go.

546
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Here's your hot milk and honey,

547
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:59,000
if you still want it.

548
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I love you.

549
00:34:04,035 --> 00:34:06,000
Love you too.

550
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And I think that you're the most
exciting woman in all of Los Angeles..

551
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Mm. Baby, will you turn off the light?

552
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Hey you guys, where are Bette and Tina?

553
00:34:35,035 --> 00:34:37,965
Boring.

554
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,500
Yeah. So boring.

555
00:34:40,535 --> 00:34:43,000
I don't know...

556
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
You know, I've been thinking about it.
What's more boring, right?

557
00:34:46,035 --> 00:34:48,965
You can make endless lists...

558
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
You can bawl your head off,
and puke over the side of the boat...

559
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Or you get to go home. You get to sleep
with the same person you've been in love with for 7 years.

560
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I don't know.

561
00:35:06,035 --> 00:35:07,017
Hey.

562
00:35:07,052 --> 00:35:07,965
Shane...

563
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Hey, hey, hey. Shane.

564
00:35:10,035 --> 00:35:12,000
Shane, please. Down!

565
00:35:12,035 --> 00:35:14,965
Down.

566
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
You're freaking me out, get down!

567
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,965
Oof!

568
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Okay, I'm coming.

569
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,965
Wakey, wakey!

570
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Jesus fucking Christ, what happened to you?

571
00:36:58,035 --> 00:36:59,000
I got food poisoning.

572
00:36:59,035 --> 00:36:59,965
Oh God!...

573
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Yeah, tell what's-her-name to do you
sober the night before a photo shoot.

574
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Is she up there?

575
00:37:07,035 --> 00:37:09,000
No, she - uh...

576
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,965
I'll go get ready.

577
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,500
Yeah, make yourself presentable...

578
00:37:14,535 --> 00:37:17,000
Makeup artists will do the rest.

579
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
They work wonders,
professional makeup people.

580
00:37:21,035 --> 00:37:21,965
Remember Gia?

581
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Twenty... c'mon, 5 more, don't give up...

582
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
How are you ever gonna
get those buns of steel?

583
00:37:28,035 --> 00:37:29,965
I don't want buns of steel.

584
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Shoot, I'll take 'em... As long as I don't have to strap
on that torture treatment!

585
00:37:32,035 --> 00:37:35,000
You know these girls
liked their strap-ons.

586
00:37:35,035 --> 00:37:35,965
Shut up, Harrison!

587
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Oh no, you didn't say that!

588
00:37:37,035 --> 00:37:38,965
And... done!

589
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Come on, let's stretch.

590
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,965
What's up?

591
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,965
I was wondering...

592
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
what are you doing tonight?

593
00:37:48,035 --> 00:37:50,000
A lot of paperwork.
Why?

594
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
David called me the other day...

595
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Okay. So I'll leave you guys to it.

596
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Um... same time tomorrow?

597
00:38:02,035 --> 00:38:03,017
Yeah.

598
00:38:03,052 --> 00:38:04,026
Good job.

599
00:38:04,061 --> 00:38:05,030
Thanks.

600
00:38:05,065 --> 00:38:05,965
Bye.

601
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Did you know he was gonna call me?

602
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Dad said he might.

603
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,965
Don't be angry with me...

604
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I didn't tell you because
I didn't want you to get your hopes up...

605
00:38:20,035 --> 00:38:21,517
in case he didn't...

606
00:38:21,552 --> 00:38:22,965
But that's bullshit!

607
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
This whole charade about him calling me
<i>because</i> Melvin says it's alright?

608
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Y'know, it - it - it - it's bullshit!

609
00:38:29,035 --> 00:38:32,000
I'm sorry you feel that way.

610
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I... I told him I would meet him
tonight at 6 at his hotel.

611
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I'm so scared...

612
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Would you come with me?

613
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I'll pick you up at 5:30.

614
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
What are you thinking?

615
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I'm thinking that I'm very happy.

616
00:39:18,035 --> 00:39:19,965
You are?

617
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Yeah. And I can't believe that I'm so happy,...

618
00:39:22,035 --> 00:39:24,965
while Tim hurts so much.

619
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Well, you deserve to be happy.

620
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
You know, I have my, um,
journals and my computer...

621
00:39:33,035 --> 00:39:34,965
at Tim's...

622
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,965
And I was wondering if I could bring...

623
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
them here 'cause they wouldn't
take up a lot of space.

624
00:39:41,035 --> 00:39:41,965
You wanna bring them here?

625
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Yes. No, I'm not saying that
I wanna move in with you,...

626
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,500
and it would be just
for a couple of days,...

627
00:39:48,535 --> 00:39:51,000
but I feel like I should be
writing right now...

628
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I would feel honored.

629
00:39:54,035 --> 00:39:56,017
I think I could...

630
00:39:56,052 --> 00:39:58,000
You should move here.

631
00:39:58,035 --> 00:39:59,517
No...

632
00:39:59,552 --> 00:40:00,965
Really?

633
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
'Cause it's beautiful the way your
- the light is coming in through the windows

634
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I feel very inspired.

635
00:40:08,035 --> 00:40:09,517
You do?

636
00:40:09,552 --> 00:40:10,965
I do.

637
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,965
Yes, you could, um...

638
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
you could write on the desk...

639
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,965
Yes.

640
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
...and looking over at the canals,

641
00:40:20,035 --> 00:40:20,965
Yes.

642
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
And, uh, you could write
great works of literature that...

643
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
would go down history...

644
00:40:28,035 --> 00:40:30,965
Yes.

645
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Don't you wish there was a parallel universe?

646
00:40:34,035 --> 00:40:35,965
Parallel universe?

647
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Yeah. Where we could live out this... fantasy?

648
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Oh... Y'know, it wouldn't be for more than a week...

649
00:40:48,035 --> 00:40:48,965
'Cause I...

650
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,500
can't stay at Tim's anymore,...

651
00:40:51,535 --> 00:40:54,000
and it would just be until...

652
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I, um... I guess I have to find...

653
00:40:57,035 --> 00:40:59,017
I would love to.

654
00:40:59,052 --> 00:41:00,526
I would love to.

655
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:01,780
Tu adorerais?

656
00:41:01,815 --> 00:41:02,965
Mm, yes. Yes...

657
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
But Francesca's coming back tomorrow.

658
00:41:06,035 --> 00:41:07,965
Francesca?

659
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Yeah. She was, uh, in Rome, doing
a ballet, and then 4 months in Budapest...

660
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
And then... oh, doing a movie.

661
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,965
Who is Francesca?

662
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Francesca. You know, I told you.

663
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Everybody knows.

664
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
No. I don't know.

665
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,965
Where are you going?

666
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Jenny, this is not the solution,...

667
00:41:53,035 --> 00:41:53,965
we have to talk about this...

668
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
You have to understand the difference between you and I...

669
00:41:57,035 --> 00:42:00,017
Francesca and I...

670
00:42:00,052 --> 00:42:03,000
it's so different...

671
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
She travels 4 to 5 months a year...

672
00:42:14,035 --> 00:42:17,000
She's a costume designer.

673
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
What's her last name?

674
00:42:21,035 --> 00:42:24,000
Wolff. With 2 f's.

675
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Who are you?

676
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,965
Someone who cares about you.

677
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
You'll find that your life is richer,
more full of possibilities and choices...

678
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I've opened up your world.

679
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,500
Fuck you.

680
00:42:54,535 --> 00:42:56,767
Jenny...

681
00:42:56,802 --> 00:42:59,000
Don't!

682
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Don't touch me.

683
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
That's great Dana,
you look amazing!

684
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Look out Kournikova,
here comes Dana Fairbanks!

685
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I don't think we should sit at the bar.

686
00:43:43,035 --> 00:43:44,965
Don't be ridiculous...

687
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I'm not gonna drink tonight.

688
00:43:46,035 --> 00:43:48,017
Tonight?

689
00:43:48,052 --> 00:43:49,965
Come on.

690
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Tell me something. When was
the last time, you saw me shitfaced?

691
00:43:53,035 --> 00:43:53,965
That's not the point.

692
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
No, the point is that you and David
have been brainwashed by Melvin...

693
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
into thinking that I'm some
kind of a falling down drunk.

694
00:44:01,035 --> 00:44:03,017
I got it under control.

695
00:44:03,052 --> 00:44:04,965
What can I get you ladies?

696
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:05,965
I'll have a mineral water please.

697
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I'm sorry, I will have
the same thing also.

698
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,965
Oh - better yet,
I'll have a seltzer!

699
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
How about a squirt
of Rose's Lime in that?

700
00:44:16,035 --> 00:44:19,000
Mm, sure.

701
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I was having a drink,
the other night when David called...

702
00:44:27,035 --> 00:44:30,000
And I haven't had one since.

703
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,965
It's been 2 days.
I'm gonna try.

704
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Well, that's good,
at least you're trying.

705
00:44:37,035 --> 00:44:38,517
How do you do it?

706
00:44:38,552 --> 00:44:39,965
What, drinking?

707
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I just - it's easy for me,
I have no desire to drink.

708
00:44:42,035 --> 00:44:42,965
No, I mean, how do you...

709
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,500
how do you keep it all together?

710
00:44:44,535 --> 00:44:46,000
I mean, you got it all down...

711
00:44:46,035 --> 00:44:47,965
Career, love...

712
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Look at you, now you're
gonna have a family!

713
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,965
What?

714
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Is - is something wrong with Tina?
Is everything okay? What, what?

715
00:44:57,035 --> 00:44:58,517
No, no, everything's fine,...

716
00:44:58,552 --> 00:45:00,000
Tina's fine, everything's great.

717
00:45:00,035 --> 00:45:00,965
You sure?

718
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Yeah, I just - I, you know...

719
00:45:03,035 --> 00:45:05,000
I have some things on my mind,...

720
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,017
but it's nothing.

721
00:45:07,052 --> 00:45:09,000
I know what it is...

722
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
You're having the daddy blues.

723
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
You are worrying about all the
responsibilities coming down on you,...

724
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
the financial responsibilities, the
'I can't take anymore risk'- responsibilities...

725
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
'Cause now there are two other lives that are
totally dependent on you keeping everything together.

726
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
It's a monster, it's big.

727
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Yeah, it is. I'm sure...

728
00:45:37,035 --> 00:45:39,000
I'm sure that's all it is.

729
00:45:39,035 --> 00:45:39,965
Sure it is!

730
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,965
Cause you and Tina are solid...

731
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
You've got a marriage like God
chose you two to find each other,...

732
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
and that's a love you
never wanna let go.

733
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I've gotta go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

734
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
You are making one big
production outta all that.

735
00:46:13,035 --> 00:46:16,000
Just want you to get
your money's worth.

736
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:21,965
Enjoy.

737
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Score, baby!

738
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,965
That, was amazing...

739
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,965
It was really great, really.

740
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,965
Thank you.
Thanks very much. Really.

741
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Hey, do you guys wanna
see the preliminary art?

742
00:46:43,035 --> 00:46:43,965
Yeah.

743
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Super, I got mockups
right over here.

744
00:46:46,035 --> 00:46:46,965
Ah, great.

745
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Okay. Check these out.
This is the one we like best.

746
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
See, our concept is, uh,
we wanna position...

747
00:46:53,035 --> 00:46:56,000
you as the gay Anna Kournikova.

748
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:57,965
What?

749
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
The gay Anna Kournikova.

750
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Hold... Hold on a second here, guys.

751
00:47:05,035 --> 00:47:05,965
Hold on a second here, guys.

752
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,965
What are you
- what are you talking about?...

753
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
his is not something we
discussed. I don't - I don't think that...

754
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:09,965
I love it. I love it!

755
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I wanna be the gay Anna Kournikova. I do!

756
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Well, that's great!
It's settled then.

757
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:18,965
This is brilliant...

758
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Wait a second, this is brilliant!

759
00:47:20,035 --> 00:47:20,965
This is - this is exactly the...

760
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
the kind of thing
we've been groping for...

761
00:47:23,035 --> 00:47:24,965
It's like - it's a hook!

762
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
You guys! That's why they're
paying you the big bucks. Right?

763
00:47:27,035 --> 00:47:28,000
Well, I don't know about that..

764
00:47:28,035 --> 00:47:30,017
Fantastic...

765
00:47:30,052 --> 00:47:32,026
Right, babe?

766
00:47:32,061 --> 00:47:34,530
You're fired.

767
00:47:34,565 --> 00:47:37,000
Get outta here!

768
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
No, really. You're fired.

769
00:47:41,035 --> 00:47:42,965
Thank you so much...

770
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Thank you so much,
you've no idea...

771
00:47:46,035 --> 00:47:49,000
how good this feels!

772
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
What time do you have?

773
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:55,000
Seven.

774
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,965
Maybe he got held up
at his meeting...

775
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
What time did he say
he was gonna finish...?

776
00:48:02,035 --> 00:48:05,000
It was 4 o'clock.

777
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
That's not him, Kit.

778
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
<i>Okay, what did you say his name was?<.i>

779
00:48:22,035 --> 00:48:23,517
David Waters.

780
00:48:23,552 --> 00:48:25,000
Waters, right...

781
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:26,965
Here he is.

782
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
David Waters checked out about...

783
00:48:29,035 --> 00:48:30,517
45minutes ago.

784
00:48:30,552 --> 00:48:32,000
Are you sure?

785
00:48:32,035 --> 00:48:32,965
Yes.

786
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,965
He's about 25 years old...

787
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Six feet tall, give or take, in a tan suit?

788
00:48:37,035 --> 00:48:39,000
I remember him,...
I checked him out myself...

789
00:48:39,035 --> 00:48:42,000
I saw him get into a cab in fact.

790
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I'm sure there's been
a misunderstanding...

791
00:48:46,035 --> 00:48:47,965
We'll call him...

792
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Do you want me to call him?

793
00:48:50,035 --> 00:48:52,000
I have his number in DC.

794
00:48:52,035 --> 00:48:55,000
No.

795
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,965
You have no reason
to be kind to me...

796
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
But I need to stay in
my writing studio tonight.

797
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:35,000
Why?

798
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
What happened?

799
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,965
Tim, please...

800
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Believe me when I say that I wish
that none of this had ever happened.

801
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Jenny. The things you say?...

802
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Have absolutely no meaning to me.

803
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
One night.

804
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
That's it.

805
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Go around the back.

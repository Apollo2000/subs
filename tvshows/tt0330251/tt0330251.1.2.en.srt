1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The L Word - ep103 - Let's Do It

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,500
They're random acts of sex. K?

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:12,450
They're encounters, romances,
one-night stands, twenty-year marriages.

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,210
Anytime...

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,600
... you get a group of gay girls together,

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,240
you are guaranteed
someone slept with someone else.

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,160
Who has slept with someone else,
who slept with someone else, and on and on.

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,050
Name any lesbian you know.
I can link her to me in like six moves.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,500
Christine Lee.

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,950
Christine Lee. Easy. Allright.
Let me think about this.

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,900
Okay. She was with Grace
Partridge, couple years ago.

12
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,710
Grace had a one-night thing with Anya...

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,120
... then Anya dated Denise...

14
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,350
... who lived with Katherine Claymore...

15
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,310
... who was my first girlfriend out of college.

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,720
It's amazing, right?

17
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:53,440
Allright, Marc, it's not just about lesbians.
It's - I could put you on this thing.

18
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,090
And, probably like six connections, easy.
I mean, one if you slept with Anya.

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,900
So?

20
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,500
So? So the point is we're all connected! See?

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,760
Through love, through loneliness,
through one tiny, lamentable lapse in judgment.

22
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,200
All of us. In our isolation.
We... reach out!

23
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:17,260
From... the darkness! From the alienation
of modern life. To form these connections.

24
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,080
I think it's a really profound statement
about the nature of human existence.

25
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,300
Allright. I - I could just do a piece
on... vaginal rejuvenation.

26
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,600
Now that I like.

27
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,170
Great.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,074

29
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,750
Let's do it.

30
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,440
Guess what?

31
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,190
I'm all nice and clean, are you
gonna get me sweaty and stinky?

32
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,550
No. But later for sure.
When we do the insemination.

33
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:25,410
You and me. Tonight, here at home.
Sexy in love, with no doctors...

34
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,120
... no fluorescent lights, no paper gowns...

35
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,170
d'ya want to?

36
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:36,510
Oh, I want to, but last time I checked,
you really needed sperm to make it worthwhile.

37
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,160
I'm going to the cryobank this afternoon.

38
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,080
For Marcus' sperm?

39
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,680
Yes.

40
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,730
I don't know what I was thinking.

41
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:53,990
I... there's no reason on earth that
I wouldn't want to make a baby with you

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,800
using a donor who's black.

43
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,140
I think - I think I was really -

44
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,420
Don't think.

45
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,540
'Cause I would love to make a baby with you.

46
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:07,870
Tonight.

47
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,350
In our home.

48
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,890
In our bed.

49
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,090
Just you and me.

50
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,970
Tim - Can I, can I talk to you?

51
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,310
Right now babe? Really gotta get going.
The girls are already in the water.

52
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,290
God, you should've seen Trish yesterday.
She was on fire, and Mary...

53
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,400
If I could just keep them right in that zone
we're absolutely going to ream SC on Saturday.

54
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,530
Go team.

55
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,950
You bet your sweet ass.

56
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,280
Wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on!

57
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,080
So when am I gonna see you again?

58
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,510
Um, I'll... I'll be at Milk on Thursday.

59
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,740
Okay!

60
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,770
I'll see you there.

61
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:58,890
You just had something.

62
00:03:58,890 --> 00:03:59,730
Yeah? Thanks.

63
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,370
I'll see ya later.

64
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,240
Okay!

65
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,430
Bye, baby.

66
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,730
Hey, what are you doing?

67
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
Yeah, let's get together.

68
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:18,530
Allright.

69
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,500
See you soon.

70
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:22,750
Yeah.

71
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:23,870
Good.

72
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,070
Higher, higher, higher, higher.

73
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,420
No, I'm uh, talking to Dana.

74
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,640
Okay, how much time do I have?

75
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,170
Okay, then I guess it's going
to be, like, ten minutes, allright?

76
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,780
I'll gotta call you back. Okay. Bye.

77
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,270
How we take a break, you get a light snack,

78
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,370
and we come back, we work
on those legs of yours. Allright?

79
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,450
Okay, what like... 45 minutes, what?

80
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,940
45 minutes. Great. K?

81
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,940
45 minutes, yeah...

82
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:48,770
Okay.

83
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,070
Reviva. Who is it?

84
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:06,310
Uhh... yeah, uh... Alice Peters,
I have an appointment.

85
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,690
I don't understand. What do you want?

86
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,680
I have an appointment.

87
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,630
For what? What do you want?

88
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,880
Allright, I need to get my vagina rejuvenated!

89
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,080
Well, why didn't you just say so?

90
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,210
I'm just...

91
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,710
Um, hi, um, Alice Peters.

92
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:47,770
Alice!

93
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,110
Gabby!

94
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,240
Don't do it, Alice, I mean the
recovery is supposed to be hell!

95
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,220
Can you tell the doctor I'm here?

96
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,920
Alice!

97
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,150
What?!

98
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,800
I behaved badly and I'm sorry,
I - I was an asshole, I know that.

99
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,550
I freaked out.

100
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,070
I was really intense, and -

101
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,750
I wasn't ready for it. But.

102
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,020
I still have feelings for you.

103
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,630
I mean, I think about you all the time.

104
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,780
You look great.

105
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,340
Look, I am not doing this again, Gabby!

106
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,330
Please!

107
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,460
Let me try again, I mean,
can't we just... have lunch?

108
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,060
No!

109
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,450
Just lunch.

110
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,780
I'll prove to you how much I've changed.

111
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,300
Say yes, Alice.

112
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,310
Just say yes.

113
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,080
Hello, Reviva.

114
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,280
Let me check the books.

115
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:58,330
Okay, what about Tuesday the 23rd,
around 3:00? 3:00? He's got a whole hour there.

116
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:05,680
Okay, um, I'm afraid they're not
until two weeks later, actually.

117
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,160
On the Thursday at 10:00 AM.
Would that be good for you?

118
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,120
Great, great. I'll put you in.

119
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,050
I didn't order that.

120
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,200
I know. They're from her.

121
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,280
Lara Perkins, our sous-chef.

122
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,030
Soup chef?

123
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,000
Yeah. Right.

124
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:48,030
Hi Jenny. It's Marina.
I was thinking about you.

125
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:56,090
"It washed up on the beach in Santa Monica,
a swollen, tangled mass in seaweed.

126
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,180
A jogger stepped, hovered,
poked at it with her toe.

127
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:05,470
Sarah Schuster's body flopped back,
her still-limpid eyes staring up at the sky."

128
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,610
You are so busted over and a day!

129
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,660
Busted, bitch!

130
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,570
Please, Lacey, stop.

131
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:40,270
You can just kiss your little 4-F's goodbye!

132
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,530
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

133
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,510
What are you talking about?

134
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,710
The 4-F's! She finds 'em, feels 'em,
fucks 'em and forgets 'em!

135
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,780
But I'm gonna tell the whole world who you are!

136
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,680
Hey! What's she doing?!

137
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,810
You are so fucked for kicking me out!

138
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,530
Calm down, figure it out somewhere else! And
keep it away from my friends and my business!

139
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,630
You'll see, Shane!

140
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,780
Ritorno pi?tardi.
(I'll return later.)

141
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,400
Allright, what's up with Jenny and Marina?

142
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,990
Nothing, as far as I know.

143
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,510
What, what's going on with Jenny and Marina?

144
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,910
Look, guys, it's none of our business, just let it go.

145
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,550
I thought Jenny was straight.

146
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,250
Dana, most girls are straight until they're not.

147
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,980
And then... sometimes they're gay 'til they're not.

148
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,160
True, but there are also the ones
that never look back. Right?

149
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,730
And you can spot them coming a mile away.

150
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:35,850
How can you tell?

151
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:36,850
You read the signals.

152
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:37,890
That's my problem.

153
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,060
Dana, it's not the problem.

154
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,210
Allright? No. Sexuality is fluid,

155
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,310
whether you're gay or you're straight or
you're bisexual, you just go with the flow.

156
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,810
No, no, no. That - is my problem, okay?

157
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:53,000
I can't feel the flow. That...
thing, whatever it is, I don't got it.

158
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,220
You don't have gaydar.

159
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,180
No.

160
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,780
You're so right, you don't have it!

161
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,800
No, everyone's got it...

162
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,510
... you just have to tune in. Yes.

163
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,940
I'm gonna prove it.
See that girl who just came in?

164
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,680
Okay.

165
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:04,730
What is she?

166
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,030
A customer?

167
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,360
I don't know!

168
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,770
Dana, look at her fingernails,
are they long or short?

169
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,560
Are they polished or natural?

170
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,800
They're long and polished. Sooo, she's -

171
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,200
Leaning to straight, but we still need more info.

172
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,100
Look at the shoes.

173
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,110
High-heeled sandals.

174
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,200
With tapered jeans.

175
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,870
Would you wear high-heeled
sandals with tapered jeans?

176
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:28,860
Yes?

177
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,660
No.

178
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,120
Oh god! Look, I've only ever
seen her in her chef's uniform.

179
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,230
Dana, I doubt that woman's a chef.

180
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,650
No, no, no. She's got a thing for a chef.

181
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,040
I do.

182
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:44,400
Dana, I'm impressed, you're into someone and
you want to know whether or not they're down.

183
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,170
She's down?

184
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,480
Whether she plays for our team. The gay team.

185
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,620
Wait... don't the bisexuals have their own team?

186
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,340
Allright. I'm gonna help you,
even though you're extremely annoying.

187
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,290
Do you know the name of this girl, first and last?

188
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,270
Yes, I do.

189
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,770
Allright. You know the chart?

190
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,440
Yeah.

191
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,840
Okay. I put it on the internet -

192
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:01,640
You what?

193
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,200
Allright, don't freak.

194
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,000
It's really cool. This thing is growing.
People are adding names.

195
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,500
And it's, like, growing exponentially.

196
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,520
That's great, Alice, I love the sound of that one.

197
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,120
"The cold, clammy wind blew.

198
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,510
Sara's coffin was lowered
into the ruddy, damp earth."

199
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,920
I was thinking about you.

200
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:24,310
Hi Jenny. It's Marina.
I was thinking about you.

201
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,250
I was thinking about you.

202
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,400

203
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,740
No messages.

204
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,480
To us.

205
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,280
To our future.

206
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:10,530
To Marcus Allenwood's
unbelievably high sperm count.

207
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,630
It's fascinating.

208
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:20,510
It's very clear pink. Sean's was kind of greenish.

209
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,630
More viscous.

210
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,890
No, don't be grossed out.

211
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,480
We have to honor it.

212
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,200
We honor you.

213
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,260
We honor you.

214
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,360
All 75 million of you.

215
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,740
Do we have everything we need...
Let's see...

216
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,490
Syringe. Diaphragm.

217
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,080
Magical juice.

218
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,050
Magic juice.

219
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,440
Let's do it.

220
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,270
Yeah, let's do it.

221
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,200
Look at that, I'm the center of the universe.

222
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,220
You're a major hub. I mean, there's one other girl,
Mary O'Reilly who dated this lesbian porn star.

223
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:21,800
Yeah?

224
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,600
She has a crazier matrix than you.

225
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,510
Oh, there's a, um - there's a dotted line -

226
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,550
There's a dotted line...
between you and Gabby Devaux.

227
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,710
No. There isn't. I ran into
her the other day. Okay?

228
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,520
I was doing research on my
vaginal rejuvenation story,

229
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,490
she was a Reviva receptionist...

230
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,530
And she thought I was there for the surgery.

231
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,870
And she was like, 'But Alice, your pussy's tight.'
Y'know? Like, 'why're you here?'

232
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,550
She looked good. It's funny.

233
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,760
Didn't she treat you like shit, Al?

234
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,580
Worse than that. Al, I swear I will
kill you if you get back together with her.

235
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,510
Okay. Shane, I'm not going
to get back together with her. K?

236
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,560
It's not gonna happen. Allright?

237
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,850
No. I'm serious.

238
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,460
Allright. What's the name of your little cook?

239
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,660
Uh, Lara Perkins. L-A-R-A.

240
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,510
She's, uh... she's the soup chef.

241
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,900
A sous-chef?

242
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,100
Like an assistant chef?

243
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:11,780
Oh, yeah.

244
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,620
Sous-chef.

245
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,020
Yeah, yeah, that's totally what she is. Yeah.

246
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,430
Okay. Well, I might as well start with Shane.

247
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,930
Why must you do that?

248
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,400
Chances are, if she's into girls, y'know...

249
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,910
Look - it - Dane? It totally
wouldn't have meant anything.

250
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,910
Oh, that's comforting, thanks.

251
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,610
She's not on it.

252
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:30,630
What does that mean?

253
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:34,130
I did a - I did a whole search. Well,
it means she didn't sleep with Shane...

254
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,040
... which is good, but she
didn't sleep with anyone.

255
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,080
How long do I have to stay this way?

256
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,290
Do you want to try putting
the diaphragm in again?

257
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,740
Ooh. God, that's disgusting. I've really
got to tell Sonya to clean under there.

258
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,560
Do we forget something?

259
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,960
Noo....

260
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,500
Hi, were you sleeping?

261
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,540
Not exactly.

262
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,140
Yeah, we tried to call but no one answered.

263
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,950
So the logical conclusion was just to come over?

264
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,680
No, uh, it's an emergency,
y'know, started as a gaydar thing,

265
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:14,190
Shane and I are totally capable of handling that,
but this one has major relationship stuff.

266
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,770
Yeah, I think at this point
she needs expert advice.

267
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,750
I am so embarrassed. I am sorry.

268
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,910
It's okay Dana. We were finished.

269
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,900
Oh, my god...

270
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:27,860
Where is she?

271
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,290
Oh, hey!

272
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,090
Hey.

273
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,920
What is this?

274
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,160
Marcus Allenwood.

275
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,550
Oh, god! Shit!

276
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,000
Okay! Allright! Allright!

277
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,140
That is disgusting.

278
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,140
Oh my god, get it off, get it off!

279
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,400
Okay! Okay! You're not going
to get pregnant through your sweater!

280
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,830
Thanks, I know. Allright, I got it. I'll get it.

281
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,660
Wait. So, we could be here
at the moment of conception.

282
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,850
You could. Yes.

283
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,100
Well then, I'm really sorry.
Would you like us to leave?

284
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,420
That would be too late.

285
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,620
Yeah, why don't you guys just
tell us about the emergency?

286
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,680
The emergency is Miss Dana is hot
for this lil nugget at her country club.

287
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,980
Lara Perkins. Looked her
up on the chart, not on it.

288
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,410
I just wanna know if she's -

289
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,430
If she's gay?

290
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,060
Have you looked at her fingernails?

291
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,100
Not gonna work. She's a chef.

292
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,310
What kind of dresser is she?

293
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:16,310
Well, she wears this cute little white uniform,
sometimes she wears a stripey apron.

294
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,550
Well, what about, um, personal interaction.

295
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:22,640
I mean, is she flirtatious,
does she make a lot of eye contact?

296
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,960
Does she touch your hand
when she's talking to you?

297
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,910
Well, I haven't really talked to her up close yet.

298
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,430
What, do you guys shout across the room?

299
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,070
No.

300
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,250
Look, I just wanna know...
I just, before I talk to her, and -

301
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,100
and make an ass of myself, I just -
I just wanna know whether or not she's -

302
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,010
Dana, honey, we can't, you know,
possibly make any kind of accurate analysis

303
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,300
when you haven't even had a conversation
with her. I mean, we need something to go on.

304
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,770
Well, she sends me food.

305
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,360
She... she sends me vegetables on skewers,

306
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,230
with, um, with like these
perfect little grill marks on them.

307
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,750
And, um, sometimes she sends me
these dipping sauces with like no fat

308
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,760
or anything else heavy in them, not
to mess up my training, you know.

309
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,920
These skewered vegetables...

310
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,450
Did she come up with them all
on her own or did you order them?

311
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,490
No, she just sends them.

312
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,690
But she hasn't spoken to you.

313
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,300
No.

314
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,560
Ask her out.

315
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,680
No, no, no, Dana cannot do that.
And that's totally understandable.

316
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:14,900
You don't want to put yourself out there for
someone who maybe is just being nice to you,

317
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,000
because, you know, you're
an important person at the club.

318
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,700
Exactly.

319
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,800
Please don't encourage her.

320
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's okay, Dana.
We are gonna take care of this.

321
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,310
You mean?

322
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,220
I mean.

323
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:23,920
What?

324
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,700
We are going to deploy a mission to ascertain the
disposition and intent of one Miss Lara Perkins.

325
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,640
Hey!

326
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,530
What are you doing in here?

327
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,700
What? There's nothing in here
I haven't seen before, believe me.

328
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,540
Oh, where's the shorts?

329
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,510
The ones you wore yesterday.

330
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,790
They're in the wash. Why?

331
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,450
They make your ass look better.

332
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,000
Not to worry. Subaru's interested
in more than a good ass.

333
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,480
Subaru?

334
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,520
Yeah. The campaign. There's gonna be
a rep in the stands tomorrow watching you train.

335
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:26,210
Oh my god. Oh my god, oh my god!

336
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:32,250
Oh, Jesus. Honey, can you pump
up a little before you hit the court...

337
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,480
... allright? I want to see veins popping.

338
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,230
Okay!

339
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,530
Who busts his balls for you?

340
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,130
You do!

341
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,550
That's right. Grr!

342
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,190
Wear the shorts.

343
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,450
I'll wear the shorts!

344
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,140
Oh my god.

345
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,830
Hey! You okay?

346
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,740
Uh... I'm fine! I'm fine.

347
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,590
That was my agent. He, uh, he just told me
Subaru might want to use me for an ad campaign.

348
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,300
So, uh, they're gonna watch me train tomorrow.

349
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,000
Which is so cool.

350
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,650
That's... that's so exciting!

351
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:13,830
Yeah, yeah it is. It is, kinda.
I mean, you know, I can't mess up.

352
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,010
So.

353
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,160
I'm sure you won't.

354
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:21,650
Um. You can turn around, now.
My jacket's back on.

355
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,070
My job is so messy.
I have to change, like, three times a day.

356
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:29,270
Yeah? You always look nice when I see you.

357
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,970
I mean... I mean, you never look dirty.

358
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,010
When I see you.

359
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,100
I gotta go. I - I have to - I have to go.

360
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:45,010
Listen, why don't you come by later?
I'll send something down for you.

361
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,100
Okay. Yeah!

362
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,140
Great.

363
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,860
Thank you.

364
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,420
Bye.

365
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,020
Bye.

366
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,560
Bag.

367
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,290
Bye.

368
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,330
Bye.

369
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:07,410
Hey, Al.

370
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,320
How'd it go?

371
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,510
You're not serious.

372
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,800
Maybe it's for the best.

373
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,700
What is?

374
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:22,330
Well, Gabby Devaux stood Alice up.

375
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,360
Yeah.

376
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,740
Nevermind. Let's go help Dana out,
then we can work out your situation.

377
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,080
I am so sorry I'm late.

378
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,040
Yeah. Yeah, you really are.

379
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:36,770
Working on my screenplay, lost track of
time. You're a writer, you know how it is.

380
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,310
Can you forgive me?

381
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,620
Yeah, um... my friends are waiting.
I should probably go.

382
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,090
Do you have to do everything
your friends want you to do?

383
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:51,430
Alice? We really gotta go.

384
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,050
Oh, yeah. You do.

385
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,630
C'mon, Alice. We gotta go.

386
00:22:58,970 --> 00:22:59,970
Okay.

387
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,870
Call me.

388
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,540
Allright, guys.

389
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,960
Let's do it!

390
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,770
Pretend you don't know us!

391
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:30,050
Dana. May I sit with you?

392
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,710
So which one is she?

393
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:39,660
Wow. Very nice, Dana.

394
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:45,150
No! I'm here for you. I'm here for you.

395
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,200
It's the redhead.

396
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,550
It's the cute redhead.

397
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,840
Kitchen shoes. Neutral.

398
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,240
Look at the earrings.

399
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,020
Hoops. Hard to read.

400
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,110
Oh, quick! Kiss me!

401
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,240
God, what are they doing?!

402
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,230
Abort.

403
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,540
Allright. I'll be back.

404
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,790
Allright. So far, it's neck-and-neck.

405
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,900
Well, she's got some good
lezzie points for her walk,

406
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:52,070
and the way she moves that chopping knife.

407
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,400
Yeah, but she's way femmy on the coiffure tip.

408
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,550
Yeah, and her reaction to the
two of you kissing was split

409
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,350
because she didn't freak
out which was a good sign,

410
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,080
but she hardly paid any attention.

411
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:04,890
Yeah, but you guys, she's got 9 in the lez
column and she only has only 7 in the straight.

412
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,850
Yeah, but the margin of error is
plus or minus 5 percentage points.

413
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,660
You know what we have to do.

414
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,240
Hi.

415
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:23,840
I'm sorry?

416
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:29,330
I was just wondering if you had those,
uh... y'know, those - those... sweet little figs.

417
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:34,210
Oh, I know what you mean, I love figs. Um,
unfortunately they're out of season right now.

418
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,550
Oh, they are? Well, then, uh...

419
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,410
I don't know, I was wondering if you just,

420
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:43,620
I don't know, if you could recommend
something else. I just kinda have that...

421
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,020
... have that craving.

422
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:52,240
Um... well, sometimes we have these
champagne truffles for dessert, but, not today.

423
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,220
Um. That's what all that comes to mind.

424
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,450
And that's it?

425
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,880
Yeah, that's it.

426
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,930
Allright then.

427
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,870
Thank you.

428
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:19,390
I'm sorry, Dana. It doesn't look
good for Miss Lara Perkins.

429
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,250
Maybe she's a different kind of lesbian.

430
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,390
Yeah, the straight kind.

431
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,860
Yeah, but, the Shane test pretty
much works on every woman.

432
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,700
You didn't get anything from her?

433
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,370
I got nothin'.

434
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,540
Oh, honey, there are a lot
of other fish in the sea.

435
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,470
Gay fish.

436
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,860
Oh, my god.

437
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,030
Who is that?

438
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:45,730
Shit. Look, will you get me to your car, please?

439
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:57,170
I don't know, you guys, you're
really cutting edge, now.

440
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,960
Lesbian moms. Biracial child.

441
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,790
We are pretty in, Alice.

442
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,660
Well, you're going to have no trouble getting
that kid into the Center for Early Education.

443
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,690
It's gonna be, like, diversity poster child.

444
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,450
Hey!

445
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:09,950
Hi.

446
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,350
Isn't that your neighbor?

447
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:15,990
You guys think he knows?

448
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:16,650
Knows what?

449
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,980
That his girlfriend's making the team with Marina.

450
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:21,730
That is ridiculous!

451
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,410
Okay. Allright. I only repeat what I hear. So.

452
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,560
Did Marina tell you?

453
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,990
Marina didn't tell her a thing.

454
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,700
It's what Marina didn't tell me, y'know?

455
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:35,160
Why is it so important for you to believe
that everyone is sleeping with everyone else?

456
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,500
Because they are.

457
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:41,140
No, that's just your little fantasy. Here is
a truly radical idea for you to contemplate:

458
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:45,340
Monogamy isn't just hypothetical.
Some people actually do practice it.

459
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:48,610
Oh.

460
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,190
Right.

461
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,740
Oh, I'll take care of it. Don't worry.

462
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,810
It's on the house.

463
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,160
Hey, thank you. How are you?

464
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,430
I'm good, and you?

465
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,400
Where have you been? I haven't
seen you and Jenny in a long time.

466
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:07,510
Yeah... I've actually been buried. We have
the biggest competition of the year in two weeks.

467
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,560
She's just been writing.
She hasn't been in at all, huh?

468
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,660
Oh, no, not when I was around, no.

469
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,020
You know what? We're
having a dinner party tonight,

470
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,130
it was just kind of thrown together
at the last minute. You should come.

471
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,410
Well, that's sweet but I have,
um, some things to do -

472
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:28,120
Seriously. It'll be fun. I mean, you're even
going to know people there. Bette and Tina...

473
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,580
Jenny would love to have you. Eight o'clock
at our house. You can bring anyone you want.

474
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,330
I see what Jenny sees in you.

475
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,770
Um... Thanks.

476
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:44,710
Come.

477
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,230
Bye.

478
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,230
Bye.

479
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:30,580
Wow. Three beautiful women
all at once? Please, come in.

480
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:33,350
Hi. You look great. Thank you.

481
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,880
Thank you, so much.

482
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:46,150
Randy Jackson, Carol Gargione. These are
our nextdoor neighbors, this is Bette Porter...

483
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,220
... Tina Kennard...

484
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,180
And this is Marina...

485
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,080
Ferrer.

486
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,390
Which is exactly why I
let her introduce herself.

487
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,900
Now, I got chili in the kitchen.

488
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,920
Jenny just called, she's
going to be a little late.

489
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,560
Sorry about that.
Make yourselves at home and I'll, uh -

490
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,630
Oh, I'll help you with these.

491
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,820
Thank you. Very much.

492
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,130
Subaru loved you.

493
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,090
What?

494
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,800
Yeah, you're their girl, you're their
A-Number-One tennis playin' babe.

495
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:16,270
I got it?

496
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:19,740
Yeah, you got it. Yeah. Done deal.

497
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:22,030
They god-damned loved your fucking guts!

498
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,990
I got it?!

499
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,110
Who do you love? Who do you love?

500
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:26,610
You!

501
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:27,380
That's right.

502
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,280
Oh my god!

503
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,580
Allright, you're sweating on me.
You're sweating all over my suit.

504
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,060
Jenny! Hey, let me grab that.

505
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,580
How are you?

506
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,240
I missed you.

507
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,540
Hi, nice to see you.

508
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:04,990
So. I got, uh, eight of those little
chocolate dessert things... very expensive...

509
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:14,750
Thank you. So. Chili's ready. You're not. And
if you can run and get changed, it'd be great. K?

510
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,780
See ya. In a second.

511
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,960
Jen... I just ran into her at The Planet.
Why are you so upset?

512
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:28,780
Because. I didn't know that she was gonna
be here, okay? It just kinda sucks and...

513
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:33,480
I have nothing to wear. Fuck. Okay, this is fine.

514
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,590
It's fine.

515
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,840
Look, I just don't get -

516
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,690
Will you shut the door, please, thank you.

517
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,400
I don't get what the big deal is.

518
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,630
Did something happen between you two?

519
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:57,710
No. Nothing happened. I don't like her, okay?

520
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,720
She has this, y'know, this way ...

521
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:06,690
of acting like she she knows everything...

522
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,460
but - I'm gonna go out there... and just...

523
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,900
get this over with.

524
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,020
Stop for a second. Jen. Stop.

525
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,920
We are not going to let
this ruin our evening, okay?

526
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,730
We're going to go back out there,
we're going to have a good time,

527
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:25,730
and whatever competitive thing
you have going with Marina...

528
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:32,050
Just ... talk to her. Y'know, kiss and
make up, or ... whatever you women do.

529
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:41,130
Allright! Everybody, everybody,
put your hands together and welcome

530
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:46,830
Rebecca Thatcher doing
Sir Mixalot's "Baby Got Back"!

531
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,410
So why did we come to karaoke night?

532
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,510
She's here!

533
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,290
Fucking Gabby Devaux again?

534
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,190
You invited her, didn't you Al?

535
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,460
Noo! I mean, I might have mentioned
that we might be here, I don't know.

536
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,130
Look, she had a really
good excuse the other night.

537
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,660
Yeah, and she's a poor excuse
for a decent human being.

538
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,200
She's really changed, Shane.
Okay? You know...

539
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,440
She's a lot better than she used to be.

540
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,480
I bet.

541
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:20,910
Wow! Did you see her boots? Hot, hot, hot!

542
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,950
Al, you get with her and I will kill you.

543
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:28,490
She'll step on your dignity
with those boots. Trust me.

544
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,920
Thank You.

545
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,970
You look like a Renaissance painting.

546
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,530
Oh! Gosh! Thank you.

547
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:46,350
Everyone, before we start, Jenny and I
have a little announcement we'd like to make.

548
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,950
You're getting married? That's wonderful!

549
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,180
Congratulations, you guys.

550
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,220
Yeah, congratulations!

551
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,190
Well, hey, that deserves a toast.

552
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,400
Tanti auguri.
(Best wishes)

553
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,820
Cheers.

554
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,090
Thank you.

555
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,430
So, can we dig in?

556
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,540
Please, do.

557
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,500
Alice, don't turn around.

558
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,200
Alice?

559
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:19,920
Hey...

560
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,250
I know you're not ignoring me.

561
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:24,530
I... was... busy. Talking.

562
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:28,130
Excuse me. Have any of you
seen Bette and Tina here tonight?

563
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:30,580
No, they had like a dinner party or something.

564
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:35,310
O-kay. Thanks, I'll just... check in with you later.

565
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,460
Bye Kit.

566
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:41,760
Anyway. Yeah, about that story, uh...

567
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,400
think they're interested in the whole chart thing.

568
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:49,020
And, um, guys - the guys at the magazine
looked pretty interested in it, and uh...

569
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,930
... something about the...

570
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:56,910
... Yeah, they liked the way it linked
the editor... to me... in like... three moves...

571
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:57,930
Alice?

572
00:34:59,130 --> 00:34:59,530
Alice.

573
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,780
What!

574
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,880
It's - It's cool.

575
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,340
May I have a glass?

576
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,100
Sure.

577
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,380
Let me see your ring.

578
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,070
Are you happy?

579
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,340
Don't ask me that.

580
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:35,890
Oh.

581
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,390
Sorry.

582
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,410
I was admiring Jenny's ring.

583
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,140
Isn't it beautiful?

584
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,820
It is beautiful.

585
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:48,270
Tim has great taste.

586
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,940
Yeah, he does.

587
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,740
I'm...

588
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,150
I'm really s...

589
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,820
I'm...

590
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,000
I'm just really not used to the way this feels.

591
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,560
This ring.

592
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,200
Yes?

593
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,270
Hi.

594
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
What are you doing?

595
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,870
What are you talking about?

596
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I know it's not my place to judge you, Marina...

597
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:45,220
and I don't know what's going on with
you and Jenny but I think this is wrong.

598
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:51,190
I'm sorry you feel that way. But I
don't think I've done anything wrong.

599
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,660
First question.

600
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,340
If you only had one day left
to live, how would you live it?

601
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,640
Jenny?

602
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,060
Yes. Oh, um...

603
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:23,370
I would probably spend the
whole day and night writing 'til...

604
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:28,710
I felt as though I'd left something
behind that I was proud of.

605
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:32,290
You mean you wouldn't
spend it with me? Really?

606
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:41,980
I would be lying on a beach,
sipping rum, and reading Borges.

607
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:45,870
And I would be with you. Because
Jenny would be off somewhere, writing.

608
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,320
I need to leave.

609
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,920
Naked in Tahiti. That's the way to do it.

610
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:58,170
Um. Bette has this throbbing headache
and she has had it since early this morning,

611
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,010
so I'm gonna take her home.

612
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:02,550
Can I get you some Advil?

613
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:07,250
No, no, I'm just gonna put her to bed, she'll
be fine. But thanks, it was such a great evening.

614
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,620
Bye Tim. That was great. Congratulations.

615
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,230
Thank you.

616
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:16,070
Bye, Bette. I hope you feel better.

617
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,700
I'm sure I will. Thanks.

618
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:21,750
What happened?

619
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:23,750
Marina and Jenny.

620
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,770
What makes you so sure?

621
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:29,520
Believe me, I saw them. They were
getting real close in the kitchen.

622
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,320
Maybe they were just talking.

623
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,840
I'm sure if anything happened, it was probably
just a one-time thing. Maybe Tim knows.

624
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,760
Tim doesn't know. They were
in there making a fool of him.

625
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,960
Why are you being so judgmental?

626
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,520
Why are you being so blas?

627
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,060
Don't you think... don't you think
you're making too much out of this?

628
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:50,590
Nope

629
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,640
Well, it's not that big of a deal.

630
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,930
Why? Just because Marina's
a woman, it doesn't count?

631
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:58,030
Oh, yeah, Bette, that's exactly what I think.

632
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:00,750
Well, those are really great values
to pass on to our kid, aren't they, Tina?

633
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,510
You mean you're pregnant?

634
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,040
Jesus!

635
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,660
And no one was gonna tell me?

636
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,020
Hi Kit.

637
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,440
I don't know. We don't know yet.

638
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,550
Why do you always have to break in?

639
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,450
Look, I'm gonna go to bed, you guys.

640
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:15,420
You can't, I need to talk to both of you.

641
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:18,560
It's not a good time.

642
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,560
Well, if I don't do it now,
then I'm going to lose my nerve.

643
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,560
If you don't do what?

644
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,150
Start making amends.

645
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,840
Is this the 12-step thing?

646
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,740
Yeah. Yeah, and I, um...

647
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,660
I have to do this or I'm not
going to get my license back.

648
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,840
So it's a requirement.
I mean, you don't even mean it.

649
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,670
You're just gonna go through
the motions like you do all the time.

650
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:42,910
I've done a lot of thinking
about it and I wrote a list

651
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:47,470
that I wanted you to look at to see if
there's anything, you know, that I forgot.

652
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,710
Okay.

653
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,020
Bette, I have to do this.

654
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,780
I apologize for the time I yelled
at you when you were ten

655
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,730
and you hid in the garage
to listen to my band practice.

656
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:23,330
I apologize that I didn't turn up for your
12th birthday party after promising I would.

657
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:28,040
And I apologize for hiding my stash in
your teddy bear and letting daddy find it,

658
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,180
even though he knew it was mine.

659
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:36,710
And I apologize for disappearing...
from your life for so many years.

660
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,980
C'mon, help me out here, you know I mean it.

661
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,140
Bette, you know, it's just not that easy for her.

662
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:05,970
Well, I guess I fucked that up!

663
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:09,570
No you didn't. It's not your fault.

664
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:27,890
Hey!

665
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:28,680
Hi!

666
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,480
So, did you hear from Subaru? Did you get it?

667
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,580
I did.

668
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:35,680
Oh, my god, that's fantastic! I knew you would.

669
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,520
Well, they're lucky to have you.

670
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,840
Oh, thanks.

671
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,080
Well, um... goodnight.

672
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,320
Goodnight.

673
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,880
Just in case you were still wondering.

674
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:17,650
Well, hey.

675
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,460
I like your... boots.

676
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,420
Hi.

677
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,020
Hi.

678
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,320
Are you, um, with anyone?

679
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:40,210
No.

680
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,550
Hey!

681
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,600
I got something to say.

682
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:57,690
There's a menace in the house. She's a user,

683
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:04,300
and a fucker, and she has probably
fucked you, and you, and you.

684
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,960
And there she is.

685
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:13,340
On the prowl for another girl to fuck
and leave. So tell her no more!

686
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:15,710
I'm sorry.

687
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:21,600
Stop the menace! C'mon!
Stop the menace! Stop the menace!

688
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,850
I think you're right to have
such strong convictions.

689
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:45,650
It makes you who you are, it sets you apart.

690
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:47,320
I love you for that.

691
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:53,420
I do.

692
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,020
C'etait un plaisir de vous rencontrer.
(It was a pleasure meeting you.)

693
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,660
J'espere vous revoir?
(Do I expect to see you again?)

694
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:06,710
... Yes!

695
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,070
Thank you.

696
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:08,870
Sure.

697
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:11,550
Goodbye, Tim.

698
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:13,010
It was wonderful.

699
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:13,910
Thank you.

700
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,760
Jenny, you have a wonderful home.

701
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,670
Thank you.

702
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:25,370
Wow. Hey, just one question.

703
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,500
Who is in love with that woman?

704
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,320
Count me in!

705
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,460
I'm only human.

706
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:36,580
The woman has a charm that goes way
beyond the fact that she's just... stunning.

707
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:42,080
Jenny? Don't you have just a little crush on her?

708
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,220
No.

709
00:44:47,305 --> 00:45:47,359

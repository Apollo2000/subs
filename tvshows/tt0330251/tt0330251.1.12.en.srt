2
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:22,582
Look. When I say I've been with people, I don't mean 20 or 30.

3
00:02:23,247 --> 00:02:28,247
Okay, so what? Like, hundreds, thousands? What?

4
00:02:28,547 --> 00:02:36,547
Somewhere between... 950 and 1200 since I was 14.

5
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:41,481
Whoa. Well, whatever, you know, it doesn't matter. I don't care.

6
00:02:41,935 --> 00:02:44,035
I turned tricks in Santa Monica with my friend, Clive.

7
00:02:45,193 --> 00:02:48,193
And all these guys thought I was some little street fag and I could've been killed.

8
00:02:48,606 --> 00:02:53,606
That's so cool when you think about it, right?

9
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:01,840
Clea, it's not cool. Listen, I like you. But what you want from me isn't gonna happen.

10
00:03:02,414 --> 00:03:07,414
Okay, you know... I know, it's because of my father, right? You guys, you have this business together -

11
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:09,081
Clea, I'm involved with someone.

12
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,140
Oh.

13
00:03:16,514 --> 00:03:21,514
Are you in love with her?

14
00:03:22,356 --> 00:03:23,556
Yeah

15
00:03:24,814 --> 00:03:26,814
I am.

16
00:03:35,442 --> 00:03:36,442
Hey, girl.

17
00:03:43,907 --> 00:03:45,907
Hey, you okay?

18
00:03:52,325 --> 00:03:56,325
Hey, you hang in there. She'll be back before you know it.

19
00:03:56,838 --> 00:04:01,717
I hope not.

20
00:04:01,717 --> 00:04:06,717
Oh. Okay! Well, you finally said it. Can I say what it is now?

21
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,830
You deserve to be happy

22
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:15,489
Your happiness is just as important as anybody else's.

23
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:23,459
C'mon, The Planet is yours.
If you and Francesca are splitting up, she's not gonna take it away from you.

24
00:04:25,242 --> 00:04:26,242
Yes, she is

25
00:04:29,242 --> 00:04:32,442
At best, she wants to be bought out

26
00:04:33,242 --> 00:04:37,442
I sat up all night trying to figure out how I can come up with that much money.

27
00:04:38,595 --> 00:04:40,595
That's a lot of money.

28
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,056
I worked so hard.

29
00:04:45,662 --> 00:04:46,662
Where's Trish?

30
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:49,099
I decided to cool it for a while.

31
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,660
Oh, yeah?

32
00:04:53,382 --> 00:04:54,382
Why?

33
00:04:54,486 --> 00:04:59,486
I was accepted at the G.S.I.E. I'm finally, uh, getting my teaching degree

34
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:03,049
Wow, that's... that's amazing

35
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:08,176
Yeah, so, when I switch departments, Trish and I can see one another again if...

36
00:05:08,794 --> 00:05:09,794
if we still want to

37
00:05:09,993 --> 00:05:10,993
Did she cry?

38
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,260
When you told her you had to break up with her?

39
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:16,312
Yeah. She did.

40
00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:21,209
How's your writing?

41
00:05:21,437 --> 00:05:26,437
It's good. I'm actually, um... working on a story right now.

42
00:05:27,607 --> 00:05:32,107
About a woman that's been mute from birth, and then she discovers that...

43
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:37,275
she's able to speak the language of manatees.

44
00:06:20,502 --> 00:06:26,502
Allright! Allright, give it up! Let's have some love, for that was Phil McCockin!

45
00:06:28,196 --> 00:06:36,196
Allright, now. For our final king of the night, let's give a good, hot welcome to Ivan Aycock!

46
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:25,229
Hey, isn't that Robin, that girl Jenny's going out with, right there?

47
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,520
Oh, yeah it is.

48
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,970
I have a date on Wednesday night.

49
00:08:37,957 --> 00:08:38,957
Anyone I know?

50
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:44,189
Um... no. Her name is Robin.

51
00:08:45,474 --> 00:08:51,474
And, uh, I met her at Palm Springs when I, you know, when I went with Tina and all of them.

52
00:08:51,675 --> 00:08:53,675
And you're telling met his... because?

53
00:08:53,753 --> 00:08:57,553
Well, because, uh, you - you know that I can't afford restaurants right now -

54
00:08:57,649 --> 00:08:58,691
Let me get this straight.

55
00:08:58,691 --> 00:09:01,691
You're asking to borrow money from me, for a date.

56
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:06,199
No, I wasn't, I was asking you if it's okay if I...

57
00:09:08,012 --> 00:09:10,012
had her to my place.

58
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:13,451
I was gonna make a salad, I suppose.

59
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,384
Wednesday's basketball and beer night.

60
00:09:18,384 --> 00:09:23,384
So, I'm not gonna be home 'til late.

61
00:09:24,158 --> 00:09:29,158
If you want, you can use the kitchen. Make your salad.

62
00:09:38,866 --> 00:09:40,866
Hello, how's everything?

63
00:09:41,827 --> 00:09:43,507
I've heard about you.

64
00:09:43,507 --> 00:09:44,507
Shane.

65
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:46,219
Check it out.

66
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,052
Shit, that sucks.

67
00:09:51,052 --> 00:09:52,052
Well, do you think...

68
00:09:53,698 --> 00:09:55,698
do you think she thought when I said...

69
00:09:55,897 --> 00:09:57,897
like when I pointed her out, but I didn't...

70
00:09:58,984 --> 00:09:59,984
that I... no.

71
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:08,056
This is so... wrong.

72
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:10,886
Yup.

73
00:10:10,886 --> 00:10:11,886
Hey, Ivan!

74
00:10:13,673 --> 00:10:16,673
This is one of the best nights of music I have ever had! I mean

75
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:21,579
and thank you for organizing the "Kings of the Night"! It was the bomb!

76
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,440
The pleasure is all mine.

77
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:29,143
Why don't you make room for the lady?

78
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,297
What can I get you, Kit?

79
00:10:33,306 --> 00:10:36,306
Um... oh, nothing, I'm fine.

80
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:41,753
Yeah, but what's your drink? I mean, a Pink Lady, Cajun Martini, maybe a simple whiskey soda?

81
00:10:41,753 --> 00:10:43,753
I'm keeping dry these days.

82
00:10:44,617 --> 00:10:47,617
Well, that's a fine thing for a beautiful lady.

83
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,919
You in the program?

84
00:10:52,093 --> 00:10:53,093
Yeah. I am.

85
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,762
Eleven years next month.

86
00:10:56,762 --> 00:11:03,862
Congratulations. I'm, uh... 37 days.

87
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,080
Thirty-seven days...

88
00:11:08,475 --> 00:11:10,475
is a lifetime.

89
00:11:11,491 --> 00:11:14,314
Look, if you ever need anyone to talk to...

90
00:11:14,314 --> 00:11:16,314
or for any other reason...

91
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:19,699
give me a call. Okay?

92
00:11:21,909 --> 00:11:22,909
Thanks.

93
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:36,629
Whoa. You're not leaving already, are you?

94
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,239
Oscar and I are due in court at 8:15.

95
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:45,060
Arthur Croft agreed to represent us pro bono against Clay Patterson.

96
00:11:46,097 --> 00:11:48,677
How - did you - did you land Arthur Croft?

97
00:11:48,677 --> 00:11:49,858
Uh-huh. Remember?

98
00:11:49,858 --> 00:11:51,858
I met him when Warner's got sued over that script I developed?

99
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:56,454
Wow, Tina. Oscar must... be beside himself.

100
00:11:56,454 --> 00:12:03,270
Yeah, and then, after we finish in court, I have a meeting with these junior high students from South Central.

101
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:07,270
We're starting an organic food co-op at their school.

102
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,027
Isn't that cool?

103
00:12:09,126 --> 00:12:10,226
Yeah, that's...

104
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:12,131
... that's great.

105
00:12:13,092 --> 00:12:13,864
Um, oh, wait

106
00:12:13,864 --> 00:12:17,964
did the, uh... my Jill Sanders suit... do you know - do you have any idea?

107
00:12:18,463 --> 00:12:20,972
Um... I think it's at the dry cleaners.

108
00:12:20,972 --> 00:12:22,178
Um... I dropped it off last week.

109
00:12:22,178 --> 00:12:24,148
Oh, great, then you could pick it up today, then?

110
00:12:24,148 --> 00:12:25,785
Uh-uh. I, uh...

111
00:12:25,785 --> 00:12:29,068
can you get James to do it? I'm having a really busy week

112
00:12:29,068 --> 00:12:31,068
Okay? Bye.

113
00:12:35,204 --> 00:12:40,204
Okay, so, he gets his, uh, Prednisone at 11 and 2 o'clock, and if for some reason I'm not home by 5 o'clock,

114
00:12:40,271 --> 00:12:45,222
just go ahead and give him his liquid thyroid medicine. It comes in three flavors: chicken, tuna and sardine.

115
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:48,645
So, you know, just... see what he's in the mood for.

116
00:12:48,645 --> 00:12:51,645
Okay. Bye, baby.
- Bye.

117
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,858
Thank you

118
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:59,829
Bye, sweety Piddly-pie!

119
00:13:00,264 --> 00:13:03,178
Ton-Ton's gonna take extra special care of you!

120
00:13:03,178 --> 00:13:06,178
My handsome, loverboy puss-pot!

121
00:13:06,261 --> 00:13:08,261
Oh yes, oh yes.

122
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,961
- Bye.
- Bye.

123
00:13:31,021 --> 00:13:36,021
Deb. It's Tonya. You will never believe where I am right now.

124
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,599
We're ready to install the main galleries,

125
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:43,666
but I want you to keep the Anish Kapur crated until our technician arrives.

126
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:44,475
Yeah.

127
00:13:44,475 --> 00:13:45,475
Hold on.

128
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:49,252
I think you should come down and see what's going on out here.

129
00:13:49,252 --> 00:13:51,252
I'll call you back.

130
00:13:53,946 --> 00:13:54,946
What?

131
00:13:55,146 --> 00:13:57,146
We have protestors setting up outside.

132
00:14:34,277 --> 00:14:35,653
Ma'am, you don't want to go in there.

133
00:14:35,653 --> 00:14:36,561
Yes, I do.

134
00:14:36,561 --> 00:14:40,951
Are you aware that this so-called museum is run by homosexual pornographers?

135
00:14:40,951 --> 00:14:43,496
Are you a homosexual pornographer?

136
00:14:43,496 --> 00:14:46,496
Get outta my face, slimeball.

137
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:53,049
The C.A.C. should be shut down! And the people inside locked away!

138
00:14:58,713 --> 00:14:59,927
Have you seen it out there?

139
00:14:59,927 --> 00:15:03,927
Yeah. One of them tried to block me from coming in the museum.

140
00:15:05,684 --> 00:15:06,419
Are you okay?

141
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:11,195
Yeah - I'm fine. I have movers due with a shipment of artwork in 40 minutes,
I have 5 artists arriving to do installation work,

142
00:15:11,195 --> 00:15:15,195
and I have a bunch of lunatics out in the courtyard who apparently want to see me tarred and feathered.

143
00:15:18,921 --> 00:15:21,248
But the main gallery looks great.

144
00:15:21,248 --> 00:15:26,248
Well, we're nearly finished. Here, let me show you some drawings of the shoji screens.

145
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:30,511
Okay. So.

146
00:15:32,885 --> 00:15:33,985
Fuck.

147
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,138
I'm sorry, I -

148
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:43,138
What happened the other night cannot happen again, do you understand?

149
00:15:46,383 --> 00:15:47,288
Um... okay,

150
00:15:47,288 --> 00:15:52,288
this is not a bearing wall. So I figured we'd just erect the scaffolding here and...

151
00:15:58,834 --> 00:15:59,834
Bette.

152
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:03,235
They have almost a hundred people out there.
They're threatening to not let the artwork in the museum.

153
00:16:03,235 --> 00:16:05,661
Jesus! What are we supposed to do?

154
00:16:05,661 --> 00:16:07,102
We should call the police.

155
00:16:07,102 --> 00:16:10,102
The police are here, but they're not gonna help you. These protestors have a permit.

156
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:14,103
What about the alley? Can we take the trucks out back and load in from there?

157
00:16:14,103 --> 00:16:15,852
No, no, no, they're blocking that, too.

158
00:16:15,852 --> 00:16:17,155
This is crazy! I don't

159
00:16:17,155 --> 00:16:20,649
I don't have time to reschedule and I'm not gonna back down from these lunatics.

160
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:22,143
Have you ever done clinic defense?

161
00:16:22,143 --> 00:16:23,972
Abortion clinics?

162
00:16:23,972 --> 00:16:26,794
I - no, I haven't. I've just written checks.

163
00:16:26,794 --> 00:16:29,121
Well, when we used to do clinic defense, there'd be,

164
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:34,121
I don't know, 40, 50, 60 of them to every 20 of us, and so we figured the only way to get a client past them...

165
00:16:35,763 --> 00:16:37,273
well, we would link arms.

166
00:16:37,273 --> 00:16:39,571
And form a column to the street and the client would get out of her car,

167
00:16:39,571 --> 00:16:42,802
she'd be immediately inside of our column and we'd get her safely inside.

168
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:44,536
Like a human shield.

169
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:45,343
Yeah.

170
00:16:45,343 --> 00:16:48,326
And how many people does it take to do something like that?

171
00:16:48,326 --> 00:16:49,752
As many as possible.

172
00:16:49,752 --> 00:16:51,752
Allright, James, I want you to ask everyone in the office.

173
00:16:52,032 --> 00:16:53,862
I think we have about 25 people. Okay?

174
00:16:53,862 --> 00:16:56,282
And let's get on the phone. I want you to call all the artists that are in town,

175
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:58,282
I want you to call your friends, we need bodies.

176
00:16:58,596 --> 00:16:59,596
Okay.

177
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:03,835
Wine?

178
00:17:04,793 --> 00:17:09,793
I have to get back to work. I have a class of 10-year-olds aspiring to be tightrope walkers.

179
00:17:10,165 --> 00:17:14,077
Ah, don't worry, we'll have it tonight. Grazie.

180
00:17:14,077 --> 00:17:16,077
Oh, actually...

181
00:17:16,174 --> 00:17:17,607
I can't do that, either. I, um...

182
00:17:17,607 --> 00:17:19,109
I already have plans.

183
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,109
What kind of plans?

184
00:17:21,484 --> 00:17:23,020
Oh, is that a secret? Oh...

185
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,856
No, it's not a secret...

186
00:17:24,856 --> 00:17:29,856
No, you should never tell a secret. Never.
So tell me something else. Do you like to read?

187
00:17:31,536 --> 00:17:33,181
Mm, I guess, when I...

188
00:17:33,181 --> 00:17:34,387
when I have time.

189
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,435
I'm not exactly a... big reader.

190
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:39,435
Have you ever read anything by, um, Anne Carson?

191
00:17:42,158 --> 00:17:45,425
Um... I don't think so. Does... does she write novels, or...

192
00:17:45,425 --> 00:17:46,987
Okay, I'm gonna give you a book.

193
00:17:46,987 --> 00:17:49,987
And you can take it with you when you run away with the circus.

194
00:17:50,364 --> 00:17:53,364
It's called, um, "Eros the Bittersweet."

195
00:17:54,978 --> 00:17:56,978
It's very romantic.

196
00:18:01,601 --> 00:18:05,628
Miss Porter. With all the controversy, is the C.A.C.
still going ahead with the "Provocations" show?

197
00:18:05,628 --> 00:18:07,000
Without the slightest hesitation.

198
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,346
I noticed Fae Buckley isn't here, do you know where she is?

199
00:18:09,346 --> 00:18:10,346
No idea.

200
00:18:10,543 --> 00:18:13,893
Did you ruin her by exposing her family tragedy? Did you go too far?
- I have to go, excuse me!

201
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:16,893
Link arms. Move around to the left and link arms.

202
00:18:16,913 --> 00:18:18,301
You are obstructing commerce!

203
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:21,301
If you do not let these movers through, you'll be violating the law!

204
00:18:30,632 --> 00:18:33,203
My god, you guys, it's a full-scale war

205
00:18:33,203 --> 00:18:34,383
Thank you so much for coming!

206
00:18:34,383 --> 00:18:36,632
Bette! Dana's coming, too. Where's Tina?

207
00:18:36,632 --> 00:18:40,078
I don't know, when I left word for her.
She and Oscar were supposed to be in court earlier this morning,

208
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,078
I can't get through.

209
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,551
So, come by after work. I'll have the book for you.

210
00:18:59,324 --> 00:19:02,324
Oh. You know what, I'll just come by tomorrow.

211
00:19:02,737 --> 00:19:05,737
No, I won't keep you long. Just come by later.

212
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,464
Okay, fine. You're... very persistent.

213
00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:12,464
Ah...Persistance est la mטre de tout le succטs.

214
00:19:13,728 --> 00:19:15,728
I'll see you later.

215
00:19:25,786 --> 00:19:28,786
Um, Marina. Remember when we talked about kind of a plan?

216
00:19:30,358 --> 00:19:34,358
Well, we are gonna find you some partners,
and we're gonna raise some money,

217
00:19:35,281 --> 00:19:38,281
and you are gonna buy Francesca out.

218
00:19:38,355 --> 00:19:40,392
Well, what about you? You could be my partner.

219
00:19:40,392 --> 00:19:44,813
Oh, I... I'm not... when maybe some of my royalties come in.

220
00:19:44,813 --> 00:19:47,813
You know I haven't seen one cent from that Slim Daddy song.

221
00:19:48,489 --> 00:19:51,489
What about Bette? She could lend you the money

222
00:19:52,572 --> 00:19:54,967
C'mon, you're good for it.

223
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:58,967
I don't know. I'm on my way over there now, as soon as Ivan gets here.

224
00:19:59,414 --> 00:20:02,414
Ivan. Ivan is right over there.

225
00:20:09,715 --> 00:20:11,026
Hey, Ivan, how you doin'?

226
00:20:11,026 --> 00:20:14,026
Ah, always good.
- Okay.

227
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:18,713
Ah, should we - better get going, I guess.
- Uh, yeah, let's go.

228
00:20:18,713 --> 00:20:21,713
Uh, hey, girl, I'll catch you later, okay?
- Yeah, have a great time.

229
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,835
Don't - don't forget to ask Bette.

230
00:20:23,835 --> 00:20:25,443
Where's Tina?

231
00:20:25,443 --> 00:20:28,443
Which godless piece of filth is that?
-Get off!

232
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:32,965
Back off, you're getting too close.

233
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,066
You heard her! She said... back off!

234
00:20:45,395 --> 00:20:47,395
You heard her! She said... back off!

235
00:20:51,255 --> 00:20:54,255
She made a video of herself being sodomized by Jesus Christ!

236
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:58,918
She was on her knees. Naked.
With Christ committing unspeakable acts on her.

237
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:13,970
Holy shit!

238
00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:15,973
Wait! No!
- I gotta help her!

239
00:21:15,973 --> 00:21:17,934
Hey! You have a DUI!

240
00:21:17,934 --> 00:21:22,934
If you go and get yourself arrested, it'll be years before you get a license again, allright?

241
00:21:23,496 --> 00:21:26,496
That's your sister right there, isn't it?

242
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:32,810
C'mon. She needs you on the outside. You can't do anything for her.

243
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:36,312
Bette! Bette, is this your first arrest? How will you plead?

244
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:40,361
C'mon. It's okay. Let's go.
- But...

245
00:21:56,218 --> 00:21:59,218
Ow! Oh, god, I'm gonna die if my parents find out about this!

246
00:21:59,923 --> 00:22:02,923
Well, look at the upside: now, being a dyke won't be a big deal.

247
00:22:04,412 --> 00:22:07,412
This is absurd! You'll be hearing from my law -

248
00:22:18,034 --> 00:22:20,034
Hey good-lookin'

249
00:22:43,882 --> 00:22:45,882
Remove your shoes...

250
00:22:46,223 --> 00:22:49,223
... and any hard objects including combs, hairpins, all watches...

251
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,260
... and... cell phones.

252
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,705
Oh, boy. No, that's like taking our life support away, you can't do that.

253
00:22:59,705 --> 00:23:01,705
No, just, let it go, Shane. It's okay.

254
00:23:03,677 --> 00:23:06,677
Take the fuckin' phone. Don't lose that.

255
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,930
I'll also need all your jewelry...

256
00:23:12,584 --> 00:23:14,584
And your eyeglasses.

257
00:23:50,336 --> 00:23:53,860
Yolanda! Hey, it's Candace. Listen, I'm in a little bit of trouble here.

258
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:58,300
Fuck, Tina, I know you're real busy saving the world and everything,
but I need you to start answering your phone.

259
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,112
Hey, Cherie, it's me. Look, I'm gonna be a little late
for our date tonight.

260
00:24:02,112 --> 00:24:04,538
Is he getting his medicine, is he listless? Has he had a poo?

261
00:24:04,538 --> 00:24:07,538
(answering machine) Alice, it's mom. Can you drop my head shots by my agent?

262
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:08,962
Why are we being held separately?

263
00:24:08,962 --> 00:24:10,962
Because you're high risk.

264
00:24:14,293 --> 00:24:16,293
Dangerous ring leaders.

265
00:24:45,463 --> 00:24:47,463
Aren't you gonna sit down?

266
00:24:50,275 --> 00:24:51,275
I can't.

267
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:53,784
Why?

268
00:24:54,197 --> 00:24:56,197
I can't sit near you.

269
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:10,002
What if... you stay on one side of the cot? I'll stay on the other.

270
00:25:10,002 --> 00:25:13,002
We'll draw an imaginary line down the middle.

271
00:25:14,751 --> 00:25:17,751
I don't think that's gonna work for me

272
00:25:32,627 --> 00:25:34,627
I am in so much trouble.

273
00:25:45,204 --> 00:25:48,204
Do you wanna play an alphabet game?

274
00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:05,295
I still want it to be a manatee.

275
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,910
Keela. Hey.

276
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:15,809
Have you ever met a manatee?

277
00:26:17,074 --> 00:26:22,074
No (es que soy gilipollas)

278
00:26:23,357 --> 00:26:27,357
They have the craziest mating behavior of any sea mammal. (Para mamףn, yo)

279
00:26:27,447 --> 00:26:29,266
She likes you.

280
00:26:30,266 --> 00:26:31,785
Have you ever met a manatee?

281
00:26:31,785 --> 00:26:38,785
Yeah, there was a small herd of them beached off
the coast of Boca Raton last month,
and I was one of the biologists called in to protect them.

282
00:26:41,377 --> 00:26:43,377
I'm Gene Feinberg.

283
00:26:43,884 --> 00:26:45,884
Jenny Schecter.

284
00:26:46,002 --> 00:26:47,844
What happened to them, why were they beached?

285
00:26:47,844 --> 00:26:56,844
Well, the, um... the one female was running
away from the 5 males. She stays in heat
for a month and the -

286
00:26:57,229 --> 00:27:04,229
the bulls spend the entire time smashing into each other,
trying to have sex with her then they just kinda ditch
her once she's pregnant.

287
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,350
Gosh, that sounds like a lot of humans.

288
00:27:10,885 --> 00:27:13,819
Please tell me that's not your experience with men.

289
00:27:13,819 --> 00:27:15,819
No. Not exclusively.

290
00:27:17,534 --> 00:27:19,534
Well, that's good.

291
00:27:19,707 --> 00:27:21,707
Do you work here?

292
00:27:23,431 --> 00:27:29,197
Mm-hmm. I'm Assistant Curator of Fish and Aquarium Dive Coordinator.

293
00:27:29,197 --> 00:27:34,197
And... you... it appears, work at a grocery store?

294
00:27:34,812 --> 00:27:37,812
Oh, god. Can you tell that by looking at me?

295
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:43,589
Uh, well, I'm familiar with the red and white checked, uh... blouse thing.

296
00:27:44,183 --> 00:27:46,183
Laurelwood Farms, right?

297
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:49,248
Yes. I didn't... know that fish had curators.

298
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:55,047
I didn't know that nice Jewish girls work in grocery stores.

299
00:27:56,558 --> 00:27:58,493
Is that your life's calling, your...

300
00:27:58,493 --> 00:28:02,493
No. It's not my life's calling. I'm... I'm a fiction writer.

301
00:28:05,372 --> 00:28:06,372
Cool

302
00:28:07,007 --> 00:28:08,993
How do you know that I'm a nice Jewish girl?

303
00:28:08,993 --> 00:28:11,993
Are you implying that you're not nice?

304
00:28:13,995 --> 00:28:15,995
Too many grapes, Keela.

305
00:28:25,315 --> 00:28:30,315
If you wanted to have dinner with me, I could tell you everything
I know about manatees.

306
00:28:50,218 --> 00:28:51,151
Thank you.

307
00:28:51,151 --> 00:28:53,151
You're welcome.

308
00:28:53,287 --> 00:28:56,287
"Eros the Bittersweet." Oh, okay, I'll read it

309
00:28:56,673 --> 00:28:59,673
Wait, there is a passage that is so beautiful.

310
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:05,004
You know what, Marina, I - I really... I gotta go. I'm sorry.

311
00:29:05,004 --> 00:29:08,004
Of course.
- Thanks.

312
00:29:10,523 --> 00:29:15,523
The Greek word, eros, denotes want, lack.

313
00:29:16,026 --> 00:29:20,461
The desire for that which is missing.

314
00:29:20,461 --> 00:29:23,461
The lover wants what it does not have.

315
00:29:23,983 --> 00:29:28,983
It is by definition impossible for him to have what he wants. If...

316
00:29:31,071 --> 00:29:33,071
as soon as it is had...

317
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:37,239
... it is no longer wanted.

318
00:29:45,874 --> 00:29:48,874
Excuse me? How much longer is this gonna be?

319
00:29:55,438 --> 00:29:57,976
You know - you know, this is really ridiculous.

320
00:29:57,976 --> 00:30:01,562
Now, I have been here, I don't know how long trying to just
- do you have any information -

321
00:30:01,562 --> 00:30:04,534
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Sit tight. Okay?

322
00:30:04,534 --> 00:30:09,534
I'm gonna go hustle up a couple of bail bonds,
just in case nobody shows up with cash.

323
00:30:09,915 --> 00:30:12,915
And. I'll bring you some Reese's Cups.

324
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,640
How you know that's what I was jonesing for?

325
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:32,471
Officer? I'm Franklin Phillips, Chairman of the Board of the
California Arts Center, here to post bail for Bette Porter.

326
00:30:32,471 --> 00:30:35,471
Thank god! Where you been, man?

327
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:39,293
I - I've been at a cocktail party for the governor. Who are you?

328
00:30:39,876 --> 00:30:41,876
Kit Porter, Bette's sister.

329
00:30:42,156 --> 00:30:45,156
Ah. Well, nice to meet you.

330
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,448
Can we, uh, hurry this up, please?

331
00:30:48,448 --> 00:30:52,448
We've got a lot of paperwork to process. You might wanna have a seat.

332
00:30:56,882 --> 00:30:57,882
Miss Porter?

333
00:31:03,842 --> 00:31:08,842
Go ahead, do the W's.
- West Virginia. Washington. Wisconsin.

334
00:31:10,391 --> 00:31:12,391
Wyoming.

335
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,700
I think that's it.

336
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:19,090
There are no "X", "Y"'s or "Z"'s.

337
00:31:37,084 --> 00:31:39,084
Let's do math. What do you know?

338
00:31:42,774 --> 00:31:44,785
Two plus two equals four.

339
00:31:44,785 --> 00:31:49,785
The square of the hypotenuse side of a right triangle
is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides.

340
00:31:54,249 --> 00:31:55,249
Hey!

341
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,750
I'm talking to you!

342
00:32:04,071 --> 00:32:09,071
Um, do you remember the first time that you were ever
really, really embarrassed by one of your parents?

343
00:32:09,405 --> 00:32:14,405
Absolutely. It was before my dad got transferred to Texas.
We were living in Fort Lauderdale. Thirteen...

344
00:32:15,732 --> 00:32:19,732
Oh, my god.
- ... years old. Junior high school. What?

345
00:32:19,823 --> 00:32:23,823
I... when I was 13, I... wait, wait, wait.
I just had a total flashback.

346
00:32:24,655 --> 00:32:29,655
I have to know more about that, please.
- No, no, no, I wanna hear about your story.

347
00:32:29,853 --> 00:32:31,581
Okay, fine.
- Okay.

348
00:32:31,581 --> 00:32:34,581
So, my mom's dropping me off at this party. First time I get invited to a cool kid's party.

349
00:32:37,053 --> 00:32:40,053
And, um, she insists on walking me in. Which is already... totally humiliating.

350
00:32:42,982 --> 00:32:46,982
And then, she's kissing me goodbye, on the lips, and as
she's walking away, she turns back and she calls out, she says,

351
00:32:52,163 --> 00:32:59,163
"Honey? You remember, the more you hang on to it, the more they
want it, so don't let any of the boys get funny with you."

352
00:32:59,736 --> 00:33:01,691
Oh, it was horrible.

353
00:33:01,691 --> 00:33:03,691
That's awful.

354
00:33:04,426 --> 00:33:07,426
Turns out I wasn't even interested in boys.

355
00:33:07,649 --> 00:33:10,649
Did you know that you were gay?

356
00:33:11,852 --> 00:33:14,852
No, I just knew I wasn't into boys. I didn't...

357
00:33:17,015 --> 00:33:22,015
realize I was attracted to girls until the first...

358
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,250
circus tour I did. I fell madly in love that year. Oh, god.

359
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,005
With the bearded lady.

360
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:33,052
- No!
- Yes
-No, it wasn't.

361
00:33:38,328 --> 00:33:40,328
I can't stand it...

362
00:33:45,136 --> 00:33:47,136
I'm sorry it's so painful.

363
00:33:49,204 --> 00:33:51,204
It's so painful.

364
00:34:12,024 --> 00:34:14,024
What are you doing right now?

365
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,740
I just laid down.

366
00:34:24,091 --> 00:34:27,091
I'm lying on top of you.

367
00:34:30,796 --> 00:34:33,796
You know what I'm doing right now?

368
00:34:35,714 --> 00:34:37,714
I think so..

369
00:34:47,177 --> 00:34:52,177
God, this is fucking insane!
What are you doing to me?

370
00:34:56,132 --> 00:34:58,132
Fucking you...

371
00:35:04,588 --> 00:35:06,588
Come over here.

372
00:35:12,163 --> 00:35:15,163
I am there, you know I am.

373
00:35:27,341 --> 00:35:32,341
So, um, I remember that we were all squished
into the back seat of the car.
- Yeah

374
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:38,870
It was me, um, Todd, Amy, and of course Andrew,

375
00:35:39,511 --> 00:35:43,573
and we're all making out, which is good.

376
00:35:43,573 --> 00:35:47,573
And then I felt that Andrew had an erection, and it was just...

377
00:35:48,052 --> 00:35:53,052
and I reached over, and I undid his fly.

378
00:35:54,225 --> 00:35:59,225
And I remember, it was really small.

379
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,771
And I remember, it was just, like...

380
00:36:03,771 --> 00:36:05,771
he was really terrified.

381
00:36:09,648 --> 00:36:11,216
So you did it?

382
00:36:11,216 --> 00:36:13,216
I did. With my panties on.

383
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,500
I just slipped them to the side. And I did it.

384
00:36:19,533 --> 00:36:24,533
I don't know why. I just felt like...

385
00:36:27,594 --> 00:36:29,594
I have to do this.

386
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:35,041
Hm. You were 13?
- Yeah.

387
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:51,579
Hey, Jenny. You in there? He said you'd be home. Jenny!

388
00:36:53,402 --> 00:36:55,402
Fuck, um...

389
00:36:57,571 --> 00:36:59,282
What's going on?

390
00:36:59,382 --> 00:37:00,782
Shit, Tim...

391
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,933
Hm. Who the hell is that?

392
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:18,231
Um... hm. That - that's Tim - that - that's my ex.

393
00:37:19,854 --> 00:37:22,854
he's renting me the place and he said that he would be out really late tonight.

394
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:28,250
Maybe we should try this another time, hm? How 'bout Friday?

395
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:31,339
I can't.
- Oh.

396
00:37:31,781 --> 00:37:37,781
I, uh... I'm working, uh... at Laurelwood Farms.
Uh... the late shift because I need the money.

397
00:37:39,393 --> 00:37:41,393
I've been there

398
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:45,361
are you free on Saturday night?

399
00:37:46,249 --> 00:37:48,249
I have a date.
- Oh.

400
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,545
I'm dating.

401
00:37:51,545 --> 00:37:52,720
Of course you are.

402
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,720
This was a date, right?
- Totally

403
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:02,830
Well... um, why don't I just... I'll, um... um, I'll call you and we'll work it out.

404
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:06,034
Yes

405
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,823
Bye. I'll see you later.

406
00:38:16,823 --> 00:38:19,823
Okay. I'll call you tomorrow.

407
00:38:29,436 --> 00:38:33,436
I guess you weren't man enough for her.
- Would you grow up?

408
00:38:39,518 --> 00:38:40,518
Hello?

409
00:38:43,881 --> 00:38:48,081
Oh. Hello, Gene. How are you?

410
00:38:52,939 --> 00:38:57,939
Yes. Well...

411
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:03,890
I would love to spend an evening
with you and several of your manatee friends.

412
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,079
Well, I will see you on Saturday night. Okay. Bye.

413
00:39:16,404 --> 00:39:18,404
Uh, thanks, Judge. I owe you.

414
00:39:19,534 --> 00:39:22,152
Uh, won't be long now. I put in some calls downtown.

415
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:24,596
You know, this sucks! You need to take better care of your people!

416
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:28,596
Oh, my god. I got the message a half hour ago.
Oscar and I were doing the soup kitchen. I'm so sorry.

417
00:39:29,464 --> 00:39:32,464
Have a seat. The petty beaurocrats are pulling
a power trip on us, here.

418
00:39:33,064 --> 00:39:34,297
Have they set bail?

419
00:39:34,297 --> 00:39:37,297
Uh, yes, it's $2,000. We got it covered. And for the artist...

420
00:39:37,874 --> 00:39:39,297
Pernao or whatever her name is.

421
00:39:39,297 --> 00:39:40,443
What about the others?

422
00:39:40,443 --> 00:39:43,176
What others? I'm not responsible for any others.

423
00:39:43,176 --> 00:39:46,604
I'll see what I can do to get them through quicker,
and then we'll get some bail bonds.

424
00:39:46,604 --> 00:39:47,604
Fuck.

425
00:39:49,617 --> 00:39:49,717
Fuck.

426
00:39:51,137 --> 00:39:53,006
I need a cigarette.

427
00:39:53,006 --> 00:39:55,006
You smoke?

428
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:57,130
Not since I was 12.

429
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:06,134
Porter. Jewell. You made bail.

430
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,630
You guys.

431
00:40:32,306 --> 00:40:35,306
Did they do anything stupid to you in there, huh?

432
00:40:36,741 --> 00:40:38,629
Oh, man. Jail is whack.

433
00:40:38,629 --> 00:40:40,295
Oh. I'm so glad you guys are here.

434
00:40:40,295 --> 00:40:41,789
Where's Bette?

435
00:40:41,789 --> 00:40:44,789
I don't know, she got thrown in a cell with -

436
00:40:48,334 --> 00:40:50,334
- Hey.
- Hey.

437
00:40:52,487 --> 00:40:53,487
Hey.

438
00:40:54,439 --> 00:40:57,439
Oh. This is Candace Jewell, my, uh, cell mate.

439
00:40:58,051 --> 00:41:03,051
Bette has been telling me what an incredible job you've
been doing at the C.A.C. It's nice to finally meet you.

440
00:41:03,441 --> 00:41:04,253
Thanks, you too.

441
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:07,063
Under some crazy circumstances.
- Yeah

442
00:41:07,063 --> 00:41:08,546
How'd you get tangled up in this mess?

443
00:41:08,546 --> 00:41:12,573
Oh, well, my crew and I were doing some work down at the gallery,
and the bible thumpers started doing their thing outside,
so one thing led to another...

444
00:41:12,573 --> 00:41:17,573
Thank you so much. That was really sweet.
- They treat you okay?
- Yeah.

445
00:41:19,327 --> 00:41:22,327
Hey!
- Hey, baby sis!

446
00:41:23,065 --> 00:41:26,065
Oh, I want you to meet Ivan. He gave me a ride over here.
- Hi.

447
00:41:28,248 --> 00:41:30,248
Oh - she - Ivan - I'm so sorry.

448
00:41:32,859 --> 00:41:36,859
ey, no worries. You know, I'm happy either way.

449
00:41:37,876 --> 00:41:39,876
We giving you a lift?
- Yeah, West Hollywood.

450
00:41:40,819 --> 00:41:41,601
Same here.

451
00:41:41,601 --> 00:41:44,651
I'm staying at a hotel. I... don't know where it is, though, it's the...

452
00:41:44,651 --> 00:41:47,260
It's the Sunset Marquis, it's right around where they live.

453
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:51,260
You know, I'm gonna stay, I think Cherie's gonna get me, so...
- What about you, Candace? Do you need a ride?

454
00:41:51,552 --> 00:41:54,552
Uh, I live all the way over in Silverlake, so I'll just get a cab.

455
00:41:54,854 --> 00:41:56,854
Don't be silly, we'll give you a ride home.

456
00:41:57,161 --> 00:41:59,161
I live in Las Feliz, I'll give you a ride if you'd like.

457
00:41:59,844 --> 00:42:02,844
Oh, thank you. That would - that would be great.

458
00:42:04,512 --> 00:42:06,512
Thanks for giving her a ride.

459
00:42:26,265 --> 00:42:29,265
Hey, uh... Cherie, it's me. Where are you? Um...

460
00:42:30,337 --> 00:42:35,337
I'm free, finally. So, if you still wanna get together,

3
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:52,085
Bette, come here!

4
00:00:52,325 --> 00:00:53,325
What?

5
00:01:00,086 --> 00:01:01,786
You're ovulating.

6
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,454
I'm ovulating.

7
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:07,455
Let's make a baby.

8
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,020
Let's make a baby.

9
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:20,328
Why don't you get dressed and
I'll drop you off on my way to work.

10
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:40,320
Hey Tim.

11
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:40,821
Bye.

12
00:01:40,822 --> 00:01:41,321
Good luck.

13
00:01:41,322 --> 00:01:42,437
Thanks.

14
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,953
Ugh! I am so ready.

15
00:01:47,988 --> 00:01:49,553
It's coming!

16
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:50,775
Thank you.

17
00:01:51,135 --> 00:01:52,135
Hi Shane!

18
00:01:52,418 --> 00:01:54,910
She doesn't talk to anyone
before her morning shot.

19
00:01:54,911 --> 00:01:56,111
Here you go, Don Juan.

20
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:58,689
I mean... she's a kid. She's a kid.

21
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,926
Whatever. It's fine.

22
00:01:59,927 --> 00:02:01,085
I mean, don't freak out.

23
00:02:01,086 --> 00:02:02,157
Okay.

24
00:02:02,876 --> 00:02:04,421
Allright. Later guys.

25
00:02:04,456 --> 00:02:05,421
Bye!

26
00:02:05,422 --> 00:02:06,308
Bye Lisa.

27
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:07,666
See ya, Shane.

28
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:10,489
Whoa, you're not leaving already?

29
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,552
Yeah, I got a nine o'clock, guys. See ya.

30
00:02:13,885 --> 00:02:14,685
Hello.

31
00:02:14,686 --> 00:02:16,266
Good morning, good morning.

32
00:02:18,635 --> 00:02:20,135
I'll meet you at the doctor's.

33
00:02:20,928 --> 00:02:22,628
Hey, what time am I supposed
to be at what's-his-name's?

34
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:23,216
Eleven.

35
00:02:23,217 --> 00:02:24,243
Okay. Bye guys.

36
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,483
Oh my god. Is it happening today?

37
00:02:26,536 --> 00:02:27,336
Is what today?

38
00:02:27,394 --> 00:02:28,574
The insemination.

39
00:02:28,793 --> 00:02:29,693
Oh!

40
00:02:29,694 --> 00:02:31,427
So you're doing it at the doctor's office this time?

41
00:02:31,529 --> 00:02:32,929
But first, Dan Foxworthy.

42
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:33,906
No way!

43
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:35,841
Who? Why don't I know
what you're talking about?

44
00:02:35,842 --> 00:02:36,621
'Cause you don't read.

45
00:02:36,622 --> 00:02:38,553
Oh, and, what are you, the intellectual of life?

46
00:02:38,554 --> 00:02:42,352
Dan Foxworthy is like the
super-exclusive shrink to the stars.

47
00:02:42,668 --> 00:02:45,268
He was on our list of L.A.'s
best self-improvement gurus.

48
00:02:45,872 --> 00:02:47,072
How did you get that appointment?

49
00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:48,431
I just called and asked.

50
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,330
Don't tell Bette I told you. Okay?

51
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,620
But, what are you guys doing,
I mean, you don't need a shrink.

52
00:02:54,852 --> 00:02:58,652
We're just checking in. We're
about to do this incredibly major thing.

53
00:02:58,723 --> 00:03:02,523
But wait, you guys have the best relationship
of anybody I know, gay or straight.

54
00:03:02,931 --> 00:03:04,331
I just want to make sure we're good.

55
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:19,609
Sorry.

56
00:03:21,964 --> 00:03:23,564
Could I offer you a ride?

57
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,920
I missed you so much.

58
00:03:28,921 --> 00:03:30,682
I... missed you.

59
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,261
Is that all you have?

60
00:03:32,262 --> 00:03:33,412
That's all I have.

61
00:03:33,885 --> 00:03:35,085
Can't believe you're here!

62
00:03:35,429 --> 00:03:36,329
Come on!

63
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:48,288
She's always running late. She had a board
meeting, then she had a meeting with an artist.

64
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,350
Bette's the director of the California Arts Center.

65
00:03:53,074 --> 00:03:54,274
I see.

66
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:57,211
And... she's probably going
to be really stressed about time.

67
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:03,091
After this, we have to go get sperm. We're trying
to have a baby, and our friend Sean's donating.

68
00:04:04,617 --> 00:04:05,617
Sorry I'm late.

69
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:08,751
James? Yeah, I gotta go in a minute.

70
00:04:09,268 --> 00:04:12,568
Nononono, the art work is way too
delicate, it's being flown in from Paris,

71
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:14,703
and Annie is already a total and
complete nervous wreck.

72
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:17,033
Just call Adam's Fine Art Movers.

73
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:23,104
Tell them if they want to do business with
C.A.C. again... exactly. Okay, great. Thanks. Bye.

74
00:04:26,311 --> 00:04:29,111
O- kay! Here I am!

75
00:04:36,464 --> 00:04:37,664
So.

76
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:40,411
We are heading north right now,
towards the Hollywood Hills.

77
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:42,561
A little further to the right is the Hollywood sign.

78
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:46,074
And uh, if you keep going all the way
in that direction, you hit the Pacific Ocean.

79
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,180
Oh, can we go?

80
00:04:49,225 --> 00:04:50,325
Yeah, whenever you want.

81
00:04:51,903 --> 00:04:53,303
As often as you want.

82
00:05:03,076 --> 00:05:06,476
Do you want to tell me what the thinking
is behind trying to have a child together

83
00:05:06,477 --> 00:05:10,442
when your sexual relationship has been
pretty shitty for going on three years?

84
00:05:10,628 --> 00:05:13,228
It's not shitty. It may not be perfect, but -

85
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,276
There's a lot more to a relationship than sex.

86
00:05:15,584 --> 00:05:17,784
We've been together for seven years.

87
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:20,419
I know plenty of couples who
still have sex after seven years.

88
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,552
Well, it's not like we never have sex.

89
00:05:22,643 --> 00:05:23,843
A lot of heterosexual couples...

90
00:05:23,887 --> 00:05:26,287
...have children when their
relationships aren't perfect.

91
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:29,659
You know, you just obviously don't understand
what happens in a lesbian relationship.

92
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:31,564
I knew this was a bad idea.

93
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:35,398
It's just, I don't believe that a straight,
male therapist can possibly understand.

94
00:05:36,864 --> 00:05:38,764
Early sex is passionate.

95
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:48,299
It's illicit, exciting, still has that - factor, but,
very quickly, a kind of symbiosis develops.

96
00:05:48,831 --> 00:05:52,131
It especially happens between two
women who are doing the work of making

97
00:05:52,132 --> 00:05:56,358
a serious commitment to one another.
And when that merging occurs,

98
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:00,919
the intense mutual dependency can
be a deterrent to sexual intimacy.

99
00:06:01,222 --> 00:06:04,622
Oh my god. The lesbian urge to merge.

100
00:06:06,787 --> 00:06:08,022
We have to stop now.

101
00:06:08,057 --> 00:06:09,122
Oh!

102
00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:12,116
Do you want to schedule another session?

103
00:06:12,117 --> 00:06:14,342
Uh, we'll let you know,
I think Tina and I need to talk.

104
00:06:15,571 --> 00:06:17,071
What about this insemination?

105
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,976
Uh, that's not up for discussion.

106
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,060
Not up for discussion?

107
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:23,910
No. It's not. I quit my job.

108
00:06:24,572 --> 00:06:27,572
I was a pretty successful
development executive.

109
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,239
Now I want to relax and prepare
my body for pregnancy.

110
00:06:30,688 --> 00:06:33,488
That's what I'm doing.
I'm ready to start a family.

111
00:06:34,137 --> 00:06:36,637
We're both ready to start a family. Right?

112
00:06:37,082 --> 00:06:38,282
Absolutely.

113
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:40,089
Right.

114
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,441
Okay. Great.

115
00:06:56,728 --> 00:06:58,728
So this is it. This is our neibourhood.

116
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:02,445
I can't believe this is our home, Tim!
It's very traditional.

117
00:07:02,446 --> 00:07:03,520
Wait'll you get to know it.

118
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:04,288
What do you mean?

119
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:09,010
It's just uh... not as
traditional as you might think.

120
00:07:09,522 --> 00:07:11,222
So, here's your new home.

121
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:15,678
I can't believe I'm finally here. This has
been the longest six months in history, Tim.

122
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:17,471
Yeah but your studio's finally ready.

123
00:07:22,295 --> 00:07:25,095
Okay, so this used to be a garage!

124
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,999
Til a few days ago.
I did a remodel on it for you.

125
00:07:29,635 --> 00:07:33,035
Come on. Try it out, come on!

126
00:07:38,497 --> 00:07:39,897
Oh my god!

127
00:07:41,652 --> 00:07:42,852
I love it!

128
00:07:42,957 --> 00:07:45,157
I have to go, allright? I'll be back soon.

129
00:07:47,704 --> 00:07:49,704
What a fuckin' auspicious occasion!

130
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:54,108
I'd love to break open a bottle of champagne
but I've gotta get back to work sometime today.

131
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,855
Sorry it's not more enticing.

132
00:08:02,856 --> 00:08:04,569
Hey, don't worry, I do this all the time.

133
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:28,229
I love his new work!
He's using paint so much more freely!

134
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,943
Yeah, I don't remember his
work having this much texture.

135
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:49,649
I don't want you to be stressed out, Annie.

136
00:08:51,481 --> 00:08:56,681
I - I know this is your first time curating for me,
and I'm going to give you a lot of support.

137
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:03,172
Hey, listen, this'll lighten your load.
Guess what Tina has between her legs?

138
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:10,617
Close. A jar of Sean Heaney's sperm.

139
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,050
I kid you not. She's keeping it warm.

140
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:21,272
Well, supposedly once it's been ejaculated, it
survives longer if you keep it at body temperature.

141
00:09:21,747 --> 00:09:25,547
Huh? Oh. Hold on a second.

142
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:30,946
Uh, it's only about half an inch but
they say it's quality, not quantity.

143
00:09:31,352 --> 00:09:34,352
God, it's repugnant, I can't believe
I used to swallow that stuff.

144
00:09:41,685 --> 00:09:44,185
Yeah, Tina said I could swim here whenever.

145
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:56,172
They're uptight at the Chateau.

146
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,480
How are they uptight?

147
00:09:57,485 --> 00:09:58,946
They don't let you swim naked.

148
00:09:59,513 --> 00:10:01,113
It is a public pool.

149
00:10:49,938 --> 00:10:52,522
Allright, I'm going to take
a look at this and while I'm gone,

150
00:10:53,023 --> 00:10:57,022
well, you remember how I told you that
there's a fair amount of evidence now

151
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,979
it's more likely to take if you're aroused.

152
00:11:08,637 --> 00:11:13,237
She's not serious!
Am I supposed to fuck you right here?

153
00:11:13,612 --> 00:11:15,012
I think it would help.

154
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,940
This is just... this is, this is too weird for me, I mean,

155
00:11:43,982 --> 00:11:45,982
I - I - I just - y'know, I really - frankly,

156
00:11:45,983 --> 00:11:48,327
I find it incredibly inappropriate
that she even suggested that,

157
00:11:48,328 --> 00:11:52,036
you know, I bet she would never
do that with a straight couple!

158
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:03,919
Come in!

159
00:12:06,022 --> 00:12:07,722
Could you come here a minute, please?

160
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:30,349
You might want to take a look at this.

161
00:12:34,873 --> 00:12:36,473
Shouldn't they be moving more?

162
00:12:36,487 --> 00:12:38,887
Yeah. That's what I wanted to show you.

163
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:42,941
I am so sorry to tell you, but that
stuff wouldn't get anyone pregnant.

164
00:12:43,785 --> 00:12:47,485
Those little fellas just don't have what it takes.

165
00:12:58,102 --> 00:12:59,102
Hello.

166
00:12:59,103 --> 00:13:00,132
Hi.

167
00:13:01,093 --> 00:13:05,693
What kind of, um, positions do you have
available because I might be looking for a job.

168
00:13:05,723 --> 00:13:07,823
Oh, um, cashier.

169
00:13:07,868 --> 00:13:08,868
Really?

170
00:13:09,385 --> 00:13:12,808
Excellent. Um, could I have an application?

171
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:14,183
Yeah.

172
00:13:14,218 --> 00:13:15,042
Great.

173
00:13:16,984 --> 00:13:18,284
There she is, there she is.

174
00:13:18,626 --> 00:13:23,026
Ah, your ladyship! Please! Don't jar anything.

175
00:13:23,115 --> 00:13:25,915
It's not like it's gonna dislodge
if she sits down too hard, Alice.

176
00:13:26,032 --> 00:13:30,132
There's nothing to dislodge.
Sean's sperm is lackluster.

177
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,135
He's low-motility. No motility, actually.

178
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:36,466
Oh, my god. You would never
know it by the way he fucks.

179
00:13:36,842 --> 00:13:40,270
Oh, Christ, Alice! When are you gonna
make up your mind between dick and pussy,

180
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:42,536
and spare us the gory bisexual details, please.

181
00:13:42,537 --> 00:13:44,573
Well, for your information, Dana,

182
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,762
I am looking for the same qualities
in a man as I am in a woman.

183
00:13:48,005 --> 00:13:48,905
Big tits.

184
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:51,591
Anyway, it explains why I haven't
gotten pregnant after six months.

185
00:13:51,592 --> 00:13:54,181
Oh, sorry Tee, he was the perfect donor.

186
00:13:54,555 --> 00:13:56,055
He was the one who Bette wanted.

187
00:13:56,308 --> 00:14:01,408
But my egg just implanted, so I could still
conceive any time over the next two or three days.

188
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:02,947
So you gotta help me find another donor.

189
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:05,759
Hold on, now, what's the matter?

190
00:14:07,505 --> 00:14:08,905
Sean's jism is no good.

191
00:14:08,988 --> 00:14:10,688
Oh, well, find you someone else!

192
00:14:10,689 --> 00:14:11,861
Who, I've got two days.

193
00:14:11,862 --> 00:14:14,311
Well, between the four of us,
we'll come up with someone.

194
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,690
What, he has to be healthy,
strong, creative, handsome...

195
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:18,737
Artistic.

196
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,273
There's always Shane.

197
00:14:20,308 --> 00:14:21,173
Guys!

198
00:14:21,174 --> 00:14:22,130
Hey!

199
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:24,221
Y'know, do you have
to dress like that all the time?

200
00:14:24,961 --> 00:14:26,161
Like what?

201
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,008
Well, I wouldn't be seen on the street with you.

202
00:14:28,043 --> 00:14:28,708
Yeah?

203
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:31,868
Every single thing about the way
you're dressed, like, screams dyke.

204
00:14:32,232 --> 00:14:33,232
God, Dana.

205
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,333
Sorry, man.

206
00:14:34,386 --> 00:14:37,086
What, look, if I'm outed,
I'm screwed, Alice, allright?

207
00:14:37,087 --> 00:14:40,778
Sponsors aren't exactly clamoring to have their
stuff repped by big ol' lezzie tennis players...

208
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,563
No, no, no, look, it's cool,
I totally dig you need to make a living.

209
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,610
I'm meeting a client anyway.

210
00:14:46,825 --> 00:14:50,625
Y'know, you are gonna pickle in that
self-loathing homophobia, I swear.

211
00:14:50,626 --> 00:14:53,144
Well you know you're gonna shrivel
in that self-righteous priggishness.

212
00:14:53,162 --> 00:14:54,162
You guys.

213
00:14:56,715 --> 00:14:59,715
Allright. Who would squirt into a jar for you?

214
00:15:02,582 --> 00:15:03,982
Hello.

215
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:13,868
What!

216
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:15,512
You are just so gay.

217
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:17,419
So gay.

218
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,100
I know.

219
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,920
I know.

220
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:24,985
Do you, uh, do you know
the neighbors next door?

221
00:15:27,382 --> 00:15:28,282
Bette and Tina?

222
00:15:28,283 --> 00:15:31,312
Yeah. Are they, um, a gay couple?

223
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,700
Yeah, they are.

224
00:15:32,828 --> 00:15:36,628
'Cause I saw them having sex
in their pool this afternoon.

225
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,310
No way, not Bette and Tina.

226
00:15:38,311 --> 00:15:39,780
What, they don't have sex?

227
00:15:39,781 --> 00:15:41,713
No, probably they do, it's just that...

228
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:45,369
you sure you saw them gettin' down?

229
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:49,179
I saw them getting way down, Tim.

230
00:15:49,414 --> 00:15:50,314
Is that right?

231
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,725
Why don't you tell me about it.

232
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,300
Okay.

233
00:15:59,276 --> 00:16:00,676
There was this girl...

234
00:16:02,953 --> 00:16:04,953
with short black hair.

235
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,330
And she walks out,

236
00:16:10,521 --> 00:16:13,921
and she takes off her clothes
in, like, two seconds flat.

237
00:16:13,922 --> 00:16:14,585
Yeah?

238
00:16:14,586 --> 00:16:15,092
Yeah.

239
00:16:15,093 --> 00:16:16,309
Like this?

240
00:16:17,273 --> 00:16:19,073
I think it was a little bit faster.

241
00:16:19,074 --> 00:16:19,689
Oh, really?

242
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,974
Yeah, I do.

243
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:21,919
I'll work on that.

244
00:16:21,923 --> 00:16:26,323
Okay. And then there was, um, this blonde girl...

245
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,890
who had these really beautiful breasts.

246
00:16:29,891 --> 00:16:30,837
Oh, really?

247
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:33,073
I wasn't really watching that closely.

248
00:16:33,074 --> 00:16:34,702
Oh, I think you were watching.

249
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:39,167
Very closely.

250
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,180
What'd they do next?

251
00:16:41,588 --> 00:16:42,488
C'mon...

252
00:16:43,057 --> 00:16:46,357
The tough, skinny one takes
the blonde, vampy one...

253
00:16:48,828 --> 00:16:51,428
...backs her against the side of the pool...

254
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,590
and then she begins to fuck her.

255
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,749
Like this?

256
00:17:10,288 --> 00:17:11,788
Ah, fuck.

257
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:39,433
Trish!

258
00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:40,050
Hey.

259
00:17:40,051 --> 00:17:42,020
Your backstroke is looking much better.

260
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:42,756
Oh, thanks!

261
00:17:42,757 --> 00:17:44,071
Looking good for U.S.C.

262
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,920
Uh, you guys got some
extra stroke time scheduled?

263
00:17:47,385 --> 00:17:49,456
Uh, yeah, tomorrow after physics, right?

264
00:17:49,491 --> 00:17:51,970
Yeah. Hey, do you think that
maybe you could come with me

265
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:54,373
in the morning to talk to Durst
about repeating my midterm?

266
00:17:54,828 --> 00:17:58,528
I can't really do it in the morning.
Um, my girlfriend Jenny is in town.

267
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:00,358
She wants me to take care of car shopping.

268
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,031
Oh, she's moving here?

269
00:18:03,352 --> 00:18:05,252
Yep, she's in it for the long haul.

270
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,260
Oh.

271
00:18:08,414 --> 00:18:09,414
Trish!

272
00:18:10,645 --> 00:18:13,545
Maybe after practice you and I
can go talk to Durst together.

273
00:18:13,695 --> 00:18:14,695
Okay.

274
00:18:21,264 --> 00:18:23,564
Yeah. Now you know you
just broke that girl's heart, right?

275
00:18:23,565 --> 00:18:25,313
Sorry, man, what was I supposed to do?

276
00:18:27,405 --> 00:18:31,505
God, is that Dana Fairbanks at
The Planet in West Hollywood?

277
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:34,542
Shh! She doesn't want her tennis
fans to know she's a gay lady!

278
00:18:36,996 --> 00:18:37,896
Funny.

279
00:18:38,348 --> 00:18:41,348
Okay, fine. What do you
guys think about butt waxing?

280
00:18:41,442 --> 00:18:42,842
Who has hair on their butt?

281
00:18:43,112 --> 00:18:44,012
I don't know.

282
00:18:46,894 --> 00:18:47,353
Alice!

283
00:18:47,354 --> 00:18:48,854
At least I don't anymore.

284
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,190
Man, why don't you just trim it?

285
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:53,099
Listen you guys, you're going to have to figure
this all out without the benefit of my wisdom.

286
00:18:53,793 --> 00:18:56,393
Bette, Tina, guess what! I had a genius idea.

287
00:18:56,394 --> 00:19:01,033
I have solved your donor problem! You two
are having a party this Saturday night,

288
00:19:01,034 --> 00:19:03,147
and we are inviting all of
the eligible men that we know.

289
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,053
Oh yeah, that's right, all two of them.

290
00:19:05,088 --> 00:19:07,888
Oh, yeah. Get them all together, at one time.

291
00:19:07,986 --> 00:19:10,186
Right! You just go fishin' in the pond!

292
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,710
Great.

293
00:19:12,305 --> 00:19:13,305
Great!

294
00:19:13,312 --> 00:19:14,312
I'm leaving now.

295
00:19:15,184 --> 00:19:17,179
Allright. I'm gonna call ya about that!

296
00:19:17,214 --> 00:19:18,079
Okay.

297
00:19:18,342 --> 00:19:19,742
Back to my question, please.

298
00:19:19,832 --> 00:19:23,400
Okay. Trimming is essential. Y'know?

299
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:26,405
You just do it a few days before
you get laid. Assuming you ever do.

300
00:19:28,161 --> 00:19:32,861
Whatever you do, you have to deal with it.
Otherwise, you'll never have bush confidence.

301
00:19:33,095 --> 00:19:35,895
If you don't have bush confidence,
you won't feel good about your bush.

302
00:19:36,223 --> 00:19:37,923
And you'll never get laid.

303
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,052
So deal with it.

304
00:19:40,893 --> 00:19:41,893
Okay.

305
00:19:55,807 --> 00:19:57,207
Do you need any rosemary?

306
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,840
It's kinda taking over my garden.

307
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:00,888
Oh, hi.

308
00:20:00,889 --> 00:20:02,061
Did I scare you? I'm sorry.

309
00:20:02,062 --> 00:20:04,605
Oh, no, no, not at all. I'm Jenny.

310
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:05,329
I'm Tina.

311
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:08,393
It's nice to meet you.
Um, I would love some rosemary.

312
00:20:10,856 --> 00:20:14,956
I have this story that I've written called,
um, "Thus Spoke Sarah Schuster".

313
00:20:14,957 --> 00:20:19,453
I feel like that's the last story that I ever
want to write about being a student.

314
00:20:19,476 --> 00:20:22,176
Oh, you might change your
mind when you get older.

315
00:20:22,177 --> 00:20:25,819
I'm actually thinking about going
back to school. I'd like a new career.

316
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,887
You should do it.

317
00:20:27,194 --> 00:20:27,694
Yeah?

318
00:20:27,695 --> 00:20:28,124
Yeah.

319
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,859
Maybe in a couple of years. But right
now I'm, uh, trying to have a baby.

320
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:33,079
Ah! Really?

321
00:20:34,415 --> 00:20:36,615
But Tim said that you and... Bette?

322
00:20:36,807 --> 00:20:37,407
Yeah.

323
00:20:37,453 --> 00:20:38,492
Were a couple.

324
00:20:38,493 --> 00:20:39,493
Oh, we are.

325
00:20:39,494 --> 00:20:40,288
Oh...

326
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:41,558
And we're trying to get pregnant.

327
00:20:41,593 --> 00:20:43,804
Oh, my god, yes, no, yes.

328
00:20:44,132 --> 00:20:45,632
Well, everything still works.

329
00:20:45,633 --> 00:20:46,256
Yes!

330
00:20:46,257 --> 00:20:47,279
We can still have a baby.

331
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,530
It's just like... there was like
a momentary brain lapse.

332
00:20:51,135 --> 00:20:51,935
Hey guys!

333
00:20:51,944 --> 00:20:52,944
Hey!

334
00:20:55,017 --> 00:20:56,217
Gay dad's group.

335
00:20:56,218 --> 00:20:56,834
Oh, my god...

336
00:20:56,835 --> 00:21:01,097
They meet once a week at a house
over on Ogden. It's all very L.A., huh?

337
00:21:02,586 --> 00:21:03,986
No, it's nice.

338
00:21:05,734 --> 00:21:07,934
Um, I should go home and write.

339
00:21:09,459 --> 00:21:10,359
Okay.

340
00:21:11,608 --> 00:21:14,108
Okay. Thank you very much for the rosemary.

341
00:21:14,455 --> 00:21:15,455
You're welcome.

342
00:21:15,577 --> 00:21:17,077
We're having a party tomorrow night.

343
00:21:17,078 --> 00:21:17,978
Oh yeah?

344
00:21:17,979 --> 00:21:19,211
You and Tim should come.

345
00:21:19,896 --> 00:21:23,388
Okay. I'll ask Tim if he
wants to. Nice meeting you.

346
00:21:23,389 --> 00:21:24,889
It's nice to meet you, too, Jenny.

347
00:21:25,036 --> 00:21:26,036
Bye.

348
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:52,447
Hey! What do you have
to say for yourself, huh?

349
00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:54,247
May I see your license and registration?

350
00:21:54,392 --> 00:21:56,392
Look, I really gotta be at -

351
00:21:56,393 --> 00:21:57,298
Ma'am.

352
00:21:57,592 --> 00:22:00,592
Okay. A'ight. Hang on.

353
00:22:03,118 --> 00:22:07,118
Y'know, I was on my way to
my first paying gig in over a year.

354
00:22:17,152 --> 00:22:19,752
You are so overreacting, she is our friend.

355
00:22:19,753 --> 00:22:22,728
Oh! Like that's ever stopped you before.

356
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,841
Like that's ever stopped anyone before.

357
00:22:24,888 --> 00:22:27,588
Right. Lesbians think friendship's
another word for foreplay.

358
00:22:29,235 --> 00:22:30,235
Hello!

359
00:22:30,258 --> 00:22:31,558
How are you doing?

360
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:36,268
Have you ever noticed that when Shane
walks into a room, someone leaves, crying?

361
00:22:36,451 --> 00:22:37,151
Shane?

362
00:22:37,152 --> 00:22:38,348
Yeah? Hey!

363
00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:42,540
Hey, how come you didn't call me the
other night? I left like... 5 messages.

364
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:45,724
Oh, well I... you know,
I haven't had my cell phone, so...

365
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:49,743
when I go get my cell phone and I
check my messages, I will call you.

366
00:22:50,748 --> 00:22:52,548
Allright. It was good to see you, though!

367
00:22:52,624 --> 00:22:53,624
You take care.

368
00:22:56,653 --> 00:22:59,853
That's just wrong, you just
can't treat people like that!

369
00:23:00,231 --> 00:23:03,331
You have to tell Shane
that that's just not right.

370
00:23:04,158 --> 00:23:05,758
Okay, I'll tell her...

371
00:23:11,568 --> 00:23:12,368
Hi.

372
00:23:12,369 --> 00:23:13,629
Hi, welcome.

373
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:20,263
Everyone, I want you to
meet our nextdoor neighbors.

374
00:23:20,471 --> 00:23:21,747
This is Tim.

375
00:23:21,748 --> 00:23:22,394
Oh, and this must be -

376
00:23:22,395 --> 00:23:23,105
Jenny.

377
00:23:23,106 --> 00:23:24,106
Nice to meet you. Bette.

378
00:23:24,107 --> 00:23:25,922
I'm Alice Pieszecki, and Shane McCutcheon.

379
00:23:26,894 --> 00:23:27,694
Nice to meet you.

380
00:23:27,867 --> 00:23:30,167
Excuse me. Are you... Dana Fairbanks?

381
00:23:30,903 --> 00:23:31,303
I'm sorry, what?

382
00:23:31,304 --> 00:23:32,441
Dana Fairbanks.

383
00:23:32,486 --> 00:23:34,186
Yes! I am.

384
00:23:34,202 --> 00:23:35,602
I'm a huge fan.

385
00:23:35,891 --> 00:23:36,391
Really?

386
00:23:36,392 --> 00:23:39,500
I saw you almost beat Capriati last
year at the Women's Invitational.

387
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:40,894
Great, she's gonna be insufferable.

388
00:23:40,895 --> 00:23:42,906
Oh, god. It's just one fan, it's okay.

389
00:23:42,907 --> 00:23:44,958
Jenny, this is, um, Dana Fairbanks.

390
00:23:44,993 --> 00:23:45,958
Hi.

391
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:48,685
She's one of the best players in
the women's tennis circuit right now.

392
00:23:49,267 --> 00:23:52,467
This is my doubles partner,
Harrison Landy. Um, honey...

393
00:23:52,768 --> 00:23:53,690
This is...

394
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:54,634
Tim.

395
00:23:54,635 --> 00:23:55,503
Tim and Jenny.

396
00:23:55,504 --> 00:23:56,446
Good to meet you.

397
00:23:58,878 --> 00:23:59,878
Nice to meet you.

398
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:00,606
What the hell are you doing?

399
00:24:00,965 --> 00:24:01,965
Field research.

400
00:24:01,966 --> 00:24:04,342
Yeah, there's a scientist at the
National Enquirer who says that

401
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:08,772
if your ring finger is longer than your
index finger, it means you're a lesbian.

402
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:10,847
Yeah. Totally gay.

403
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:12,329
Has there ever been any doubt?

404
00:24:12,802 --> 00:24:14,402
Oh, my god, look, I'm gay too.

405
00:24:14,534 --> 00:24:16,534
Thank god, because otherwise
I'd have to leave you.

406
00:24:18,629 --> 00:24:20,929
Okay, Alice makes the team, but just barely.

407
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:25,466
This may be controversial, but it...
seems like I may be a lesbian, too.

408
00:24:26,855 --> 00:24:31,155
Huh, that's so weird. Her index finger and
ring finger are exactly the same length.

409
00:24:31,156 --> 00:24:31,951
What does that mean?

410
00:24:31,952 --> 00:24:33,363
Maybe she's bisexual.

411
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,980
Dana, Harrison, can you make
Tim and Jenny a drink for me?

412
00:24:38,086 --> 00:24:39,586
Yeah, sure. Sure, sure, sure.

413
00:24:39,976 --> 00:24:41,576
Uh, drinks? Kitchen?

414
00:24:42,317 --> 00:24:45,717
So, Tim, do you play tennis? 'Cause
I'm always looking for a little action.

415
00:24:46,331 --> 00:24:49,231
Uh... actually, uh, I'm a swim coach.

416
00:24:49,329 --> 00:24:50,329
Oh.

417
00:24:53,486 --> 00:24:57,586
According to our computer, ma'am,
this license was revoked six months ago.

418
00:24:57,587 --> 00:24:59,923
Well, that's what I would call a technicality.

419
00:24:59,924 --> 00:25:03,294
If you want to get technical, I should
haul you downtown and throw you in jail.

420
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,444
I was on my way to a gig at the Roxy!

421
00:25:05,517 --> 00:25:07,917
Yeah, uh, you know Ivan Neville,
he's on the bill with me,

422
00:25:07,918 --> 00:25:11,079
well he and I were gonna check
out a AA meeting together.

423
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,816
Ivan Neville of the... Neville Brothers?

424
00:25:13,154 --> 00:25:14,154
Yeah.

425
00:25:14,155 --> 00:25:15,535
God, I love the Neville Brothers!

426
00:25:16,316 --> 00:25:18,716
Uh, oh, well, have you
ever seen them in concert?

427
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:22,785
Once. Years ago. Back when I was
stationed in New Orleans, I mean...

428
00:25:22,786 --> 00:25:30,451
Ohh, well have you ever been on stage, five feet
away from Aaron and his brothers performing?

429
00:25:30,627 --> 00:25:38,227
Say, like, a month from now at the House
of Blues? You know, I could hook you up.

430
00:25:41,221 --> 00:25:43,921
Allright, look. This is still revoked. Allright?

431
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:47,409
We have to leave the car.

432
00:26:01,403 --> 00:26:06,603
Wow. This is very - a very interesting party.

433
00:26:06,612 --> 00:26:11,012
Oh, that's because Bette's a big art
world lady. So there are a lot of artists.

434
00:26:11,296 --> 00:26:12,396
Yeah, there are a lot of, uh...

435
00:26:12,397 --> 00:26:13,398
Lezzies?

436
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,600
Really? Are there really?
You know, I hadn't noticed that.

437
00:26:16,635 --> 00:26:18,535
Yeah, it's kinda hard to miss.

438
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:21,659
Uh, Tina told me that she and Bette
are thinking about having a baby.

439
00:26:21,907 --> 00:26:22,807
Mm-hmm.

440
00:26:22,808 --> 00:26:24,894
Oh, there's a lot of that going around.

441
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,500
They even had to change that famous joke.

442
00:26:28,972 --> 00:26:33,272
It used to be, What do lesbians
bring on a second date?

443
00:26:33,716 --> 00:26:34,816
A moving van.

444
00:26:35,611 --> 00:26:40,211
Now, it's, What do lesbians
bring on a second date?

445
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:43,719
A turkey baster.

446
00:26:48,227 --> 00:26:52,527
That's so funny. Honey, I don't even
know why you'd know that joke.

447
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,853
Who's he been hanging out with, huh?

448
00:26:55,867 --> 00:26:57,067
Excuse me.

449
00:27:01,146 --> 00:27:03,446
Excuse me. What were you thinking?

450
00:27:03,986 --> 00:27:05,986
Excuse me, Simon.
What was I thinking, what?

451
00:27:06,152 --> 00:27:08,552
For inviting those geeky straight
people, I'm sorry, no offense.

452
00:27:08,851 --> 00:27:12,151
I mean, I've gotta hang on Harrison
all night like some big, fat hetero.

453
00:27:12,152 --> 00:27:13,152
Excuse me, Dana?

454
00:27:14,002 --> 00:27:17,637
We really love you, but, it's not our
cross to bear that you and Harrison

455
00:27:17,638 --> 00:27:20,038
have decided to masquerade
as Ozzie and Harriet.

456
00:27:21,711 --> 00:27:22,511
K?

457
00:27:24,377 --> 00:27:26,377
Sorry, Simon. So, what was I saying?

458
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:30,992
Oh, right, commitment. Uh, we wouldn't expect
any kind of committment from you,

459
00:27:30,993 --> 00:27:35,056
financial or otherwise, I mean really you wouldn't
even have to know the child if you... didn't...

460
00:27:35,157 --> 00:27:37,479
Although it'd be nice if
you wanted to have, I mean,

461
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,293
we'd like it if our donor had
a relationship with our child.

462
00:27:40,294 --> 00:27:43,458
But you'd have to sign a donor contract,
relinquishing all parental rights -

463
00:27:43,459 --> 00:27:49,024
Whoa, Bette. Tina. Slow down. I...
don't want you to waste your breath.

464
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:50,244
Why?

465
00:27:50,427 --> 00:27:55,727
I'm flattered. Totally flattered.
But... I just couldn't handle it.

466
00:27:55,728 --> 00:28:00,306
I mean... what happens when this
kid turns 17, his life's a complete mess,

467
00:28:00,307 --> 00:28:03,928
hates both of your guts and next thing
I know he's camped on my doorstep,

468
00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:06,488
asking me to save him from
his miserable fucking life.

469
00:28:08,078 --> 00:28:09,178
I can't do that.

470
00:28:14,623 --> 00:28:16,223
Best first fiction?

471
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,100
Yes.

472
00:28:18,994 --> 00:28:20,894
Wow. Isn't that like a major prize?

473
00:28:20,895 --> 00:28:22,448
Um, I guess so.

474
00:28:23,153 --> 00:28:26,253
So, um, what's, what's the, uh, story about?

475
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:34,092
I have this, uh, this character that I write about
that's sort of like this alter ego but not really,

476
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:39,026
and the story is called
"Thus Spoke Sarah Schuster. "

477
00:28:39,061 --> 00:28:40,526
That's pretty bold.

478
00:28:41,782 --> 00:28:42,982
I hope you're good.

479
00:28:44,209 --> 00:28:49,110
Um, Jenny, this is Marina. She owns The Planet.
It's a little cafe down on Santa Monica.

480
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:53,848
Yeah, I, I walked by the other day but
it was too crowded so I didn't go in.

481
00:28:54,123 --> 00:28:58,323
It gets really crowded, thanks to Alice
who wrote me up in her magazine.

482
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:01,366
Are you a writer?

483
00:29:01,401 --> 00:29:06,101
Yeah, for L.A. Magazine? Yeah. More
of a journalist. Little different from you.

484
00:29:06,102 --> 00:29:07,379
I don't think it's different.

485
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,455
Jenny just won this literary prize.

486
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:12,449
It's really big, for... this story
she was just talking about.

487
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,173
"Just Spoke" something? "Just"...

488
00:29:14,174 --> 00:29:17,507
"Thus Spoke Zarathustra".
That's a Nietzsche reference.

489
00:29:17,644 --> 00:29:18,344
Yeah.

490
00:29:18,345 --> 00:29:19,694
Has your story been published?

491
00:29:19,855 --> 00:29:23,855
Yes! It'll be in the next
"Best American Short Stories," right?

492
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,760
Which is, I don't know if I told you
but I write a lot of "Best Of" pieces.

493
00:29:26,761 --> 00:29:27,724
Oh, okay.

494
00:29:27,737 --> 00:29:29,337
That's where I discovered Amy Bloom,

495
00:29:29,338 --> 00:29:32,680
I read this beautiful story
she wrote called, um...

496
00:29:33,531 --> 00:29:34,931
"Silver Water. "

497
00:29:35,823 --> 00:29:39,523
"Come To Me. " That's one
of my favorite collections.

498
00:29:39,593 --> 00:29:44,569
I think that I probably have read everything
that Amy Bloom has ever written.

499
00:29:44,604 --> 00:29:48,669
I'm about to start on this
"Best Cosmetics Under $100."

500
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:51,514
There's supposed to be this guy in Calabasas

501
00:29:51,515 --> 00:29:54,806
who does these Botox injections
for seventy five bucks a pop.

502
00:29:55,065 --> 00:29:56,365
Isn't that illegal?

503
00:29:56,397 --> 00:29:58,397
Have you read anything by Anne Carson?

504
00:30:00,074 --> 00:30:02,374
"The Autobiography of Red. "

505
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:05,202
"Eros the Bittersweet. "

506
00:30:05,843 --> 00:30:09,743
I think, um, those books
practically changed my life.

507
00:30:11,565 --> 00:30:14,065
What about you? Have you read them?

508
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:15,739
Yes.

509
00:30:16,933 --> 00:30:22,333
Wow! You guys should totally take the
Cosmo romance compatibility quiz!

510
00:30:23,147 --> 00:30:27,347
Well, this would be my singular
romantic compatibility question:

511
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,585
What is your favorite - no, no no.

512
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:38,069
Your most... influential, important,
life-altering book, of all time.

513
00:30:44,596 --> 00:30:46,796
I don't know if I want to answer that.

514
00:30:49,844 --> 00:30:51,044
What's yours?

515
00:30:51,738 --> 00:30:53,238
I asked you first.

516
00:30:54,796 --> 00:30:56,096
I have an idea!

517
00:30:56,911 --> 00:31:00,911
Jenny, you could whisper yours in this ear,
and Marina you could whisper yours in this ear,

518
00:31:00,912 --> 00:31:02,570
and I'll tell ya if you're compatible.

519
00:31:02,951 --> 00:31:04,351
'Cause I think I already know.

520
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,764
Whatever. I'm just...

521
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:18,499
gonna leave you two
alone to get married!

522
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:21,869
What did you say?

523
00:31:22,766 --> 00:31:24,366
What did you say?

524
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,460
Bette was set on an artist, but
she says you have exquisite taste

525
00:31:31,461 --> 00:31:33,382
in the work that you show in your gallery.

526
00:31:33,383 --> 00:31:34,453
I do.

527
00:31:34,777 --> 00:31:36,077
You said that?

528
00:31:36,567 --> 00:31:38,767
I gotta tell ya, I couldn't be more flattered.

529
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:40,831
I know you two are gonna
be wonderful mothers

530
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:44,261
and I bet you'll have guys lining up
around the block begging to jerk off for ya.

531
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:47,070
Robin, are you setting us up for a turn down?

532
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:51,199
Believe me, it's got nothing to do with you guys
and I have no reservations about you two,

533
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,967
it's my own genetic shortcomings which
I wouldn't want to pass on to any child.

534
00:31:55,002 --> 00:31:58,567
I mean, look how bow-legged
I am? It's a family trait.

535
00:31:59,049 --> 00:32:00,749
Oh, that's cute, we could live with that.

536
00:32:01,118 --> 00:32:04,318
I also carry the gene for buck teeth,
my mother and my three sisters are all...

537
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:05,569
There are always braces.

538
00:32:07,771 --> 00:32:11,371
We also have the propensity for shingles.
Early onset manic depression.

539
00:32:11,372 --> 00:32:12,424
Both treatable.

540
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:17,032
Premature hair loss. Among the
women, as well as the men. It's...

541
00:32:17,033 --> 00:32:18,264
Oh, we could get one of those...

542
00:32:18,265 --> 00:32:19,272
A weave.

543
00:32:19,391 --> 00:32:22,091
Also a hideous... tendency to drool?

544
00:32:22,954 --> 00:32:23,854
Okay.

545
00:32:24,155 --> 00:32:24,818
We get the picture.

546
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:25,917
We get it.

547
00:32:26,864 --> 00:32:27,864
Okay.

548
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:29,656
Thank you.

549
00:32:29,757 --> 00:32:30,557
Thanks, Robin.

550
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:33,850
Sure. Sorry. Good luck.

551
00:32:34,855 --> 00:32:36,555
I'm really sorry you missed your gig.

552
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,082
You know what to do about your car?

553
00:32:40,677 --> 00:32:44,777
Yeah. Yeah, don't go
beating yourself up over it...

554
00:32:49,312 --> 00:32:54,612
You are one decent human being,
and that's rare in this soulless town.

555
00:32:55,283 --> 00:32:56,583
Keep it real!

556
00:32:57,353 --> 00:32:58,553
Allright.

557
00:33:03,897 --> 00:33:06,866
No way! Kit! Hi!

558
00:33:06,867 --> 00:33:09,487
Hey, girl, whassup? How you doin'?

559
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:10,821
Come in! Welcome!

560
00:33:10,851 --> 00:33:12,451
Yeah, thanks, girl.

561
00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:23,029
Hey.

562
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,468
There you are.

563
00:33:25,674 --> 00:33:27,474
I'm just waiting for the wash room.

564
00:33:35,233 --> 00:33:36,533
D'you wanna... use...

565
00:34:16,678 --> 00:34:18,078
You were on the Olympic swim team?

566
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,299
Yeah. I was.

567
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,271
This is amazing. I have a project in
development about competitive swimming

568
00:34:22,272 --> 00:34:26,200
but we haven't been able to crack
the story. Would you be interested?

569
00:34:28,754 --> 00:34:32,154
Uh... there is this one incredibly
dramatic thing that happened.

570
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:33,918
When I was swimming for U of Chicago...

571
00:34:34,723 --> 00:34:37,723
...We had this one guy on the team that was
probably the best swimmer I have ever -

572
00:34:37,724 --> 00:34:39,195
Take me home.

573
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:42,091
Jen, I want you to meet -
I want you to take me home, now.

574
00:34:43,735 --> 00:34:44,835
Excuse me.

575
00:34:44,836 --> 00:34:46,024
Yeah, sure.

576
00:34:47,062 --> 00:34:52,062
Uh... obviously I have to go.
It was good talking to you.

577
00:34:52,063 --> 00:34:53,573
Sure, you too, thank you.

578
00:34:56,987 --> 00:35:00,687
Okay. Is your sister like the
coolest person on earth, or what?

579
00:35:07,259 --> 00:35:09,159
What's Kit doing here?

580
00:35:09,867 --> 00:35:11,467
Your guess is as good as mine.

581
00:35:18,774 --> 00:35:22,774
Jen, I was in the middle of a conversation.
Do you wanna at least tell me what's going on?

582
00:35:23,713 --> 00:35:24,713
I felt weird.

583
00:35:24,714 --> 00:35:28,140
That's pretty vague, Jen,
even for you. You felt weird.

584
00:35:40,864 --> 00:35:43,664
What are you...? Jen, come on.

585
00:35:44,439 --> 00:35:45,739
We need to talk.

586
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:49,439
Jen, what are you doing?

587
00:35:59,547 --> 00:36:00,747
Jenny...

588
00:36:31,644 --> 00:36:34,244
Are you going to tell me why
you're not at your gig at the Roxy?

589
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:38,044
Well, that was something
I came over here to tell you.

590
00:36:38,045 --> 00:36:40,374
Bette, you never told me that
Kit Porter was your sister.

591
00:36:41,888 --> 00:36:42,888
Wow.

592
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,740
My half-sister.

593
00:36:44,741 --> 00:36:45,938
Guess which half.

594
00:36:45,939 --> 00:36:49,839
That is extremely cool. Uh,
Jeremy Block. I said hi earlier.

595
00:36:50,256 --> 00:36:53,756
I saw you play a couple years ago at the
Hollywood Roosevelt. You're - you're awesome.

596
00:36:53,848 --> 00:36:55,948
Oh, thank you, you're very kind.

597
00:36:56,081 --> 00:36:59,181
No, you really were. We're putting together
the soundtrack for a picture I'm producing.

598
00:36:59,182 --> 00:37:01,705
We're working with a bunch
of classic jazz and blues ladies

599
00:37:01,706 --> 00:37:04,182
and I guarantee who will completely dig you.

600
00:37:05,176 --> 00:37:08,176
Well, I was about to get into
something here with my baby sister...

601
00:37:08,181 --> 00:37:10,881
I'm sure it can wait. I've
got a house full of people.

602
00:37:11,991 --> 00:37:14,091
Come on. Party's in
the back room at Les Deux.

603
00:37:15,523 --> 00:37:16,623
Are you sure?

604
00:37:16,673 --> 00:37:19,073
It's a potential gig, you should definitely go.

605
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:22,786
Okay.

606
00:38:00,771 --> 00:38:02,771
What an ego bruiser.

607
00:38:04,579 --> 00:38:06,679
Three turn-downs in one night.

608
00:38:07,016 --> 00:38:09,016
Is there something wrong with our pitch?

609
00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:10,509
It has nothing to do with you guys.

610
00:38:11,479 --> 00:38:13,879
You know, it's the... it's the new male.

611
00:38:14,354 --> 00:38:15,354
What?

612
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:18,490
What do you know about men, I mean,
you've never even been with a man.

613
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:21,150
Well, the new male is more
spiritual than the old male.

614
00:38:21,725 --> 00:38:24,125
He seems his sperm as
an extension of his inner being,

615
00:38:24,126 --> 00:38:28,700
whereas the old male shot into any female
without thinking about what would happen.

616
00:38:28,789 --> 00:38:32,389
The new male totally cares
what becomes of his seed.

617
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,530
Oh, my god, it's Yoda.

618
00:38:34,531 --> 00:38:36,883
Yeah, they teach that at
hairdresser school, by the way.

619
00:38:37,467 --> 00:38:40,867
Well that's great. Why do they
have to go all sensitive on us

620
00:38:40,868 --> 00:38:44,487
just when we need them to keep
on being the same old assholes.

621
00:38:46,279 --> 00:38:47,379
I don't know.

622
00:38:48,031 --> 00:38:50,731
Allright. Yeah, we're gonna go.

623
00:38:50,732 --> 00:38:52,021
Ohh.

624
00:38:53,038 --> 00:38:54,338
Goodnight, you guys.

625
00:38:58,692 --> 00:39:00,392
Bye...

626
00:39:04,122 --> 00:39:06,122
She's totally going home with that girl.

627
00:39:07,151 --> 00:39:11,151
Oh, my god, get off me, Harrison,
the party's over, go back to being gay.

628
00:39:11,152 --> 00:39:13,532
I gotta go. You guys need help cleaning up?

629
00:39:14,871 --> 00:39:15,871
We got it.

630
00:39:15,872 --> 00:39:17,409
Yeah, somebody's coming in tomorrow.

631
00:39:18,349 --> 00:39:19,349
Goodnight, you guys.

632
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,790
Goodnight.

633
00:39:21,557 --> 00:39:23,257
Thank you so much.

634
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:25,164
Have a good night.

635
00:39:25,165 --> 00:39:26,447
Good night.

636
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:46,799
Oh, shit.

637
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,860
How long have you been out here?

638
00:39:52,904 --> 00:39:57,104
I couldn't sleep last night.
And you were totally out.

639
00:39:57,998 --> 00:40:00,698
Yeah, well, somebody wore me out.

640
00:40:01,801 --> 00:40:03,401
I came up here...

641
00:40:04,492 --> 00:40:06,192
around three o'clock...

642
00:40:07,066 --> 00:40:08,466
in the morning...

643
00:40:08,965 --> 00:40:11,065
and then I started to write.

644
00:40:12,221 --> 00:40:14,121
And I was so scary.

645
00:40:16,001 --> 00:40:17,501
It's a whole new place, Jen.

646
00:40:19,044 --> 00:40:21,244
It's just going to take you
a while to find your groove.

647
00:40:22,428 --> 00:40:23,428
Yeah.

648
00:40:27,663 --> 00:40:31,863
You know, you never told me
why you were so upset last night.

649
00:40:35,508 --> 00:40:37,908
'Cause I was just a little drunk.

650
00:40:39,511 --> 00:40:41,511
I hope I didn't ruin your night.

651
00:40:42,976 --> 00:40:46,076
I think it turned out pretty
well. Don't you think?

652
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:47,068
Yeah.

653
00:40:57,261 --> 00:41:01,361
Okay everybody, let's get those butts up,
out of the saddle and get on the road!

654
00:41:03,601 --> 00:41:05,801
The fucking party made me so depressed.

655
00:41:06,328 --> 00:41:09,128
We have to wait a whole
month before another insemination.

656
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:11,661
Yeah, well at least you
have somebody to wait with.

657
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:15,530
At least there's someone in bed with you
when you wake up in the morning, you know.

658
00:41:16,042 --> 00:41:17,242
Now everyone.

659
00:41:17,823 --> 00:41:21,923
Drop your heads. Close your
eyes and set your intentions.

660
00:41:22,571 --> 00:41:23,871
Why are you here?

661
00:41:24,754 --> 00:41:26,754
To gossip with your friends?

662
00:41:27,143 --> 00:41:28,543
Or to change your body?

663
00:41:28,978 --> 00:41:31,878
What do you want to get
out of the next forty minutes?

664
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,739
A good look at your
spectacular tits would be nice.

665
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,557
Go for it.

666
00:41:35,558 --> 00:41:37,850
No... besides, she's straight.

667
00:41:38,355 --> 00:41:39,355
How do you know?

668
00:41:39,356 --> 00:41:40,913
Because I'm so attracted to her.

669
00:41:41,517 --> 00:41:44,917
Everytime I'm attracted to somebody,
she's either unavailable or straight.

670
00:41:44,918 --> 00:41:46,104
Dana!

671
00:42:06,813 --> 00:42:07,513
Jenny!

672
00:42:07,514 --> 00:42:08,590
Hey!

673
00:42:08,912 --> 00:42:09,812
Are you here by yourself?

674
00:42:09,813 --> 00:42:11,594
Yeah, I am by myself.

675
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:12,236
Do -

676
00:42:12,237 --> 00:42:13,536
But I'm gonna go home
and make a sandwich.

677
00:42:13,537 --> 00:42:15,420
No, no. We've got a table.

678
00:42:15,987 --> 00:42:17,187
Come sit with us.

679
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,484
Okay, okay.

680
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:24,304
This instructor recommended this
workshop called "All Write", W-R-I-T-E,

681
00:42:25,149 --> 00:42:28,449
and this instructor meets with you
and does this thing called body work,

682
00:42:28,585 --> 00:42:31,185
you know to help you get in
touch with your inner voice...

683
00:42:31,497 --> 00:42:32,997
which I thought was weird!

684
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,420
You know, you should
check out my magazine,

685
00:42:36,421 --> 00:42:39,854
because we sometimes do these
resource lists for the creative community.

686
00:42:39,908 --> 00:42:40,908
Oh, okay.

687
00:42:40,911 --> 00:42:44,011
Or, uh, you know, UCLA might be your best bet.

688
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:48,425
No, I don't wanna... I don't wanna go back
to school. But, what's the name of the -

689
00:42:48,426 --> 00:42:51,277
Marina has a reading group.
You guys met the other night.

690
00:42:51,356 --> 00:42:52,156
Hi, Jenny.

691
00:42:52,157 --> 00:42:53,220
Hey.

692
00:42:55,603 --> 00:42:56,703
So...

693
00:42:56,967 --> 00:42:58,667
How do you like The Planet?

694
00:42:59,498 --> 00:43:00,898
It's beautiful.

695
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,659
It's nice.

696
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,600
Do you want to come to my reading group?

697
00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:06,183
Yes.

698
00:43:06,393 --> 00:43:08,493
That means I can read one of your stories.

699
00:43:08,494 --> 00:43:10,380
No, you can read anything you want.

700
00:43:10,683 --> 00:43:12,783
You know. Anything.

701
00:43:12,807 --> 00:43:15,207
Oh, shit, oh, god, it's late.

702
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:18,891
You know, I, uh, I - I - I'm starting
a new tour so I should go practice.

703
00:43:19,656 --> 00:43:21,156
I'm gonna follow you guys out.

704
00:43:21,387 --> 00:43:22,387
Jenny, good luck.

705
00:43:22,388 --> 00:43:23,417
Yes, thank you.

706
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:25,799
I think you might have found
what you were looking for.

707
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,898
Bye, Alice.

708
00:43:27,099 --> 00:43:28,397
It was good to see you.

709
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:29,442
You'll be okay?

710
00:43:29,443 --> 00:43:29,904
Yeah, I'm good.

711
00:43:29,905 --> 00:43:30,952
Of course she's okay.

712
00:43:33,172 --> 00:43:34,272
You're okay, right?

713
00:43:34,273 --> 00:43:37,207
No, I'm good. I'm good. I, uh, I...

714
00:43:37,227 --> 00:43:38,927
I hope I didn't upset you the other night.

715
00:43:38,928 --> 00:43:40,147
No.

716
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:42,150
You didn't upset me.

717
00:43:42,896 --> 00:43:46,796
I just, uh, I came here to say that I'm not, I...

718
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:52,219
I'm not...

719
00:43:52,236 --> 00:43:53,936
A big coffee drinker?

720
00:43:59,086 --> 00:44:03,786
I have to go. I have to go.
Tim is gonna be home...

721
00:44:03,934 --> 00:44:06,734
...at five. So.

722
00:44:07,258 --> 00:44:09,258
But it - it's only two.

723
00:44:11,477 --> 00:44:12,977
So... I - I need -

724
00:44:12,978 --> 00:44:14,945
Don't be upset. It's only two o'clock.

725
00:44:14,946 --> 00:44:19,271
I know, but I need to be
there. When he calls. Okay?

726
00:44:19,691 --> 00:44:20,820
Okay.

727
00:44:20,834 --> 00:44:21,634
Okay.

728
00:44:21,769 --> 00:44:23,069
I'll walk you to your car.

729
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,280
Okay.

730
00:44:25,546 --> 00:44:26,083
Yeah?

731
00:44:26,084 --> 00:44:27,584
Yeah.

732
00:44:31,405 --> 00:44:32,405
Thank you.

733
00:44:32,406 --> 00:44:35,286
For what? Turning you into a speed freak?

734
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:39,370
Is this your car?

735
00:44:39,405 --> 00:44:43,284
Yes, I mean, this is... this is Tim's car.

736
00:44:43,721 --> 00:44:45,121
It's embarrassing.

737
00:44:45,452 --> 00:44:46,752
A muscle car.

738
00:44:47,514 --> 00:44:49,114
It's sexy.

739
00:44:49,431 --> 00:44:52,531
Are you busy tomorrow night?
Do you wanna come to Radar?

740
00:44:54,881 --> 00:44:56,081
What's Radar?

741
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:59,226
It's a special night we do here on Tuesdays.

742
00:44:59,245 --> 00:45:00,245
Great.

743
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,560
No, thank you.

744
00:45:09,431 --> 00:45:10,531
Okay.

745
00:45:14,734 --> 00:45:16,334
Call me if you change your mind.

746
00:45:16,369 --> 00:45:17,416
Okay.

747
00:45:26,131 --> 00:45:27,531
I could do this, yes.

748
00:45:28,647 --> 00:45:32,547
And you have no problem with the
concept of bringing a child into the world

749
00:45:32,548 --> 00:45:36,235
and having absolutely no say
as to how he or she is raised.

750
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:40,830
I must have children all over the world. Now,
why would I have a problem with this one?

751
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,722
I will sign the donor's contract now.

752
00:45:44,219 --> 00:45:48,019
Jean-Paul, I don't mean to be rude
or anything, but do you have any, uh...

753
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:53,357
medical... problems,
a history of family illnesses, or...

754
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:56,316
Health is excellent with the Chamois family.

755
00:45:56,631 --> 00:45:59,631
Uh, Jean-Paul, I know you say
that you're comfortable with all this

756
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:01,060
but I just want you to
think about it for a minute.

757
00:46:01,061 --> 00:46:02,275
Where is this contract?

758
00:46:11,616 --> 00:46:13,316
And, uh, when we do this?

759
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,260
Uh, when Tina's next ovulating.

760
00:46:16,253 --> 00:46:18,553
You want to do this, uh, here in my bed?

761
00:46:20,385 --> 00:46:22,085
Or, do you want me to come to you?

762
00:46:25,255 --> 00:46:29,455
Wherever you want. Uh.
We'll... give you a sterile cup.

763
00:46:30,348 --> 00:46:35,089
Or, if you prefer, if you need your privacy, I can
come back later after you finish and pick it up.

764
00:46:35,124 --> 00:46:36,189
Cup?

765
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,200
What is this cup?

766
00:46:38,201 --> 00:46:40,197
Uh... well, it's a specimen cup.

767
00:46:40,311 --> 00:46:42,311
You... ejaculate into it.

768
00:46:42,402 --> 00:46:46,802
Ah, no no no. We don't do that way.
We do as a... man and a woman.

769
00:46:47,493 --> 00:46:50,593
Jean-Paul, I'm sorry,
I just thought you understood.

770
00:46:51,296 --> 00:46:52,829
Do you want it to be all three?

771
00:46:52,864 --> 00:46:55,589
Because that would be fine.
It is going to be your baby, too.

772
00:46:55,624 --> 00:46:56,589
No.

773
00:46:56,861 --> 00:46:58,761
No? It's just me and her. Bon.

774
00:46:58,762 --> 00:47:03,210
Jean-Paul. Not only are we
monogamous, we don't sleep with men.

775
00:47:03,978 --> 00:47:06,078
But, uh, to have a baby there is no other way.

776
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,555
Just not an option for us, okay?

777
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:11,410
But, for me it is the only option.

778
00:47:12,321 --> 00:47:13,821
An obligation.

779
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:18,590
I cannot bring a baby into this world that
is not conceived through the passionate...

780
00:47:21,018 --> 00:47:22,818
...between a man and a woman.

781
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:32,813
Hey, the penis, the pussy, the baby.

782
00:47:35,068 --> 00:47:36,568
You can't be serious!

783
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:39,446
Ze penis, ze pussy, ze baby?

784
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:43,568
Oh, god, I swear.

785
00:47:45,275 --> 00:47:47,075
C'mon, Tee, it's funny.

786
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:49,425
I'm sorry, I don't find it funny.

787
00:47:52,451 --> 00:47:55,151
Try. It's important to have a sense
of humor about these things.

788
00:47:55,457 --> 00:47:58,457
Oh, well, I guess you're just going to
take care of that for the both of us.

789
00:48:04,044 --> 00:48:05,544
Why are you doing this?

790
00:48:06,567 --> 00:48:08,567
What, what am I doing?

791
00:48:24,922 --> 00:48:27,622
We got married and we've
got Trish, and I think we -

792
00:48:27,944 --> 00:48:28,844
Hey, Randy.

793
00:48:28,845 --> 00:48:30,344
Hey.

794
00:48:30,884 --> 00:48:31,884
Wow.

795
00:48:32,138 --> 00:48:33,338
You look amazing.

796
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:34,220
Thanks.

797
00:48:34,255 --> 00:48:37,655
Damn. I think I'm gonna ditch
Randy and take you out, myself.

798
00:48:37,656 --> 00:48:38,755
Do you wanna come?

799
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:41,475
Hey, 'cause we got a shitload of work to do.

800
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,400
Hey, but you do look great.

801
00:48:43,424 --> 00:48:44,524
Thank you.

802
00:48:44,857 --> 00:48:46,257
I'm not going to be late.

803
00:48:46,265 --> 00:48:48,065
Okay.

804
00:48:49,938 --> 00:48:51,038
Goodbye.

805
00:48:54,469 --> 00:48:55,469
Bye, Randy.

806
00:48:55,571 --> 00:48:56,871
Goodnight.

807
00:49:02,423 --> 00:49:04,523
Wonder where's she off
to all dolled up like that?

808
00:49:04,686 --> 00:49:09,086
Uh, The Planet, they're uh, having
some kind of special party or something.

809
00:49:09,087 --> 00:49:10,458
And you're letting her go alone?

810
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:12,119
I'm making her go.

811
00:49:12,217 --> 00:49:13,917
She doesn't know that many people.

812
00:49:14,127 --> 00:49:16,527
If you know her, she's kind of a recluse.

813
00:49:22,569 --> 00:49:23,769
Hi.

814
00:49:25,732 --> 00:49:27,032
Hello, Jenny.

815
00:49:28,171 --> 00:49:29,471
It's all women.

816
00:49:29,689 --> 00:49:32,089
Oh, yeah, Radar is a woman's party.

817
00:49:36,093 --> 00:49:37,493
That's what I'm talking
about. What do you think?

818
00:49:37,977 --> 00:49:40,177
Hot. So hot.

819
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:43,137
Hi.

820
00:49:43,138 --> 00:49:45,380
Hey, Jenny. Didn't know
you were coming out tonight.

821
00:49:45,381 --> 00:49:47,126
Yeah, Marina invited me.

822
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:48,201
Hey, hey.

823
00:49:48,286 --> 00:49:49,886
I thought she'd like Radar.

824
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:56,425
Bette's sister, Kit, does a
poetry night. I think you'd enjoy it.

825
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:58,730
Where's Bette?

826
00:49:58,843 --> 00:50:00,043
She's at work.
They're still fighting.

827
00:50:00,805 --> 00:50:02,805
Oh, my god, there's so many hot girls here.

828
00:50:05,033 --> 00:50:06,033
Hi!

829
00:50:06,034 --> 00:50:06,793
Hi.

830
00:50:06,794 --> 00:50:07,795
How are you?

831
00:50:08,456 --> 00:50:09,756
Good...

832
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,820
I'm gonna go play pool,
so I will see you all later.

833
00:50:18,845 --> 00:50:19,885
Bye.

834
00:50:20,571 --> 00:50:22,371
You shoulda hit on her when we first came in.

835
00:50:22,372 --> 00:50:23,463
I don't get it.

836
00:50:24,664 --> 00:50:26,664
What does Shane have that I don't have?

837
00:50:26,665 --> 00:50:27,938
It has to do with your attitude.

838
00:50:28,093 --> 00:50:29,393
I've got attitude.

839
00:50:29,422 --> 00:50:31,022
It's because she's so withholding.

840
00:50:31,023 --> 00:50:32,855
No... it's because she's so confident.

841
00:50:32,856 --> 00:50:36,162
No, it's because she's so stupid and
stupid people are too dumb to be insecure.

842
00:50:36,163 --> 00:50:38,260
Dana... she's your friend.

843
00:50:38,261 --> 00:50:41,905
It's confidence, okay? I'm telling
you. It's because of her nipples.

844
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,320
What do you mean it's
because of her nipples?

845
00:50:43,321 --> 00:50:45,324
She has the best nipples
in town and she knows it.

846
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:47,870
Oh, my god, you're so right,
she has nipple confidence!

847
00:50:48,175 --> 00:50:49,175
They are nice.

848
00:50:49,218 --> 00:50:51,418
Yeah. They're small and
they're perfectly formed.

849
00:50:51,419 --> 00:50:54,324
I wonder if I could sell a story
on L.A.'s best nipples -

850
00:50:54,396 --> 00:50:55,496
Oh, that'd be good.

851
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,334
It's a good one, right?

852
00:50:56,628 --> 00:50:58,928
I think I'm just gonna wander around for a bit.

853
00:50:58,929 --> 00:50:59,720
Are you allright?

854
00:50:59,721 --> 00:51:00,789
Yeah, I'm good.

855
00:51:15,845 --> 00:51:17,045
Hi there.

856
00:51:18,361 --> 00:51:20,161
No. Thank you.

857
00:51:38,223 --> 00:51:42,723
The total is $77.83. So, I give you the card...

858
00:51:43,495 --> 00:51:45,295
oh, and I do this...

859
00:51:49,812 --> 00:51:51,512
...and then you have to sign it.

860
00:51:54,163 --> 00:51:55,263
Thank you.

861
00:51:55,499 --> 00:51:56,399
Thanks, guys.

862
00:51:57,093 --> 00:51:59,093
Okay... What do I do with this?

863
00:52:00,782 --> 00:52:02,282
So do you like living in this neighborhood?

864
00:52:02,283 --> 00:52:05,245
Um, I don't know, it's okay, I guess.

865
00:52:05,725 --> 00:52:09,225
You don't mind it that there are...
a lot of homos and stuff around?

866
00:52:09,848 --> 00:52:10,948
What?

867
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,622
Don't get me wrong, they
seem pretty cool to me, but,

868
00:52:13,657 --> 00:52:16,157
aren't they always like checking
out your boyfriend and stuff?

869
00:52:17,132 --> 00:52:18,132
No.

870
00:52:19,045 --> 00:52:20,345
Customer.

871
00:52:20,982 --> 00:52:21,982
Oh, my god.

872
00:52:21,983 --> 00:52:23,005
Page me if you need me.

873
00:52:26,463 --> 00:52:28,863
C'mon. I wanna see you check me out.

874
00:52:30,109 --> 00:52:31,209
Okay...

875
00:52:34,524 --> 00:52:36,024
I'm sorry.

876
00:52:36,327 --> 00:52:37,627
About last night.

877
00:52:38,352 --> 00:52:39,352
I should've...

878
00:52:40,052 --> 00:52:41,852
I shouldn't have left like that.

879
00:52:42,423 --> 00:52:47,523
I feel really silly. I feel really, really
silly and I think I kind of freaked out.

880
00:52:47,524 --> 00:52:49,852
And not because it was a gay bar, okay?

881
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:55,970
But because I had absolutely no idea
what I was doing there. You know?

882
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:01,420
Okay. Um, the total is $54.05.

883
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:06,318
I hope they overpay their employees as
much as they overcharge their customers.

884
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,320
Do you want to come to my reading
group? It's one week from Monday.

885
00:53:15,371 --> 00:53:16,371
I don't know.

886
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:20,350
I have to... check with Tim.

887
00:53:21,055 --> 00:53:22,055
There you go.

888
00:53:23,957 --> 00:53:27,957
Marina. Is your - is your
reading group a gay group?

889
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:30,130
No.

890
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:32,710
There are straight people.

891
00:53:36,993 --> 00:53:39,593
You look cute with the little apron on.

892
00:53:48,369 --> 00:53:51,569
Yes. Okay. I'm sorry.

893
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:55,730
We get together once a month. Five
couples, fifty dollars per couple is our limit.

894
00:53:55,766 --> 00:53:56,766
Really?

895
00:53:57,101 --> 00:54:01,501
Jenny and I belonged to a game back in
Chicago. She's not a very good cheater, though.

896
00:54:01,673 --> 00:54:02,873
I am not a cheater.

897
00:54:02,874 --> 00:54:05,305
Excuse me. I am not a cheater.

898
00:54:05,306 --> 00:54:11,021
Tim likes to say that I am a cheater
because Tim is always losing. Right, Tim?

899
00:54:11,022 --> 00:54:15,823
Come on, that's not true. Not never, anyway.
Once I went out, up three whole dollars.

900
00:54:16,487 --> 00:54:19,687
You guys should come tomorrow night. We can
always make room for another couple, right?

901
00:54:20,917 --> 00:54:23,117
Cool, uh, what time do you guys start?

902
00:54:23,887 --> 00:54:26,787
Um, I can't, I have that, um, book club thing.

903
00:54:27,294 --> 00:54:30,594
So, just call and cancel. This could be
fun, maybe we could become regular -

904
00:54:31,542 --> 00:54:32,542
I'm committed.

905
00:54:32,927 --> 00:54:35,027
So uncommit. What's the big deal?

906
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:39,721
'Cause, um, it's only once a month and
I've been really looking forward to it.

907
00:54:42,037 --> 00:54:44,337
Oh, god, do you really want me to cancel?

908
00:54:44,541 --> 00:54:45,541
No.

909
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:46,908
Go on.

910
00:54:48,642 --> 00:54:50,442
We won't be able to make it.

911
00:54:50,842 --> 00:54:52,042
Just keep us in mind, though.

912
00:54:52,043 --> 00:54:53,234
Sure, man.

913
00:54:58,827 --> 00:54:59,327
Hi.

914
00:54:59,328 --> 00:55:00,333
Hey.

915
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:02,150
I thought you were hanging with Joe.

916
00:55:03,908 --> 00:55:05,608
He's got it under control.

917
00:55:06,767 --> 00:55:09,067
I thought we could spend the
rest of the evening together.

918
00:55:10,953 --> 00:55:14,353
I need exercise.
Feeling a little tense.

919
00:55:17,046 --> 00:55:18,046
Fine.

920
00:55:18,942 --> 00:55:20,542
I guess I should've called first.

921
00:55:22,162 --> 00:55:23,362
Yeah.

922
00:55:33,316 --> 00:55:36,616
I can't believe that Carolyn See is in the group.

923
00:55:36,941 --> 00:55:40,041
I know. Great lines... such a turn-on.

924
00:55:40,521 --> 00:55:44,121
I am so happy that I came,
I feel very, very inspired!

925
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:45,990
Well, good! That's what it's all about.

926
00:55:45,991 --> 00:55:46,854
Yes.

927
00:55:46,903 --> 00:55:49,003
Maybe next time you'll read
from one of your stories.

928
00:55:49,185 --> 00:55:50,285
No!

929
00:55:50,315 --> 00:55:51,615
Why not?

930
00:55:54,095 --> 00:55:55,495
Because.

931
00:55:55,496 --> 00:55:57,353
You don't have to do
anything you don't wanna do.

932
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:04,130
Tina!

933
00:56:04,854 --> 00:56:06,454
Hey. What are you doing here?

934
00:56:07,165 --> 00:56:09,465
I'm just exorcising some demons.

935
00:56:10,043 --> 00:56:11,643
You look really good.

936
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:12,801
I do?

937
00:56:12,868 --> 00:56:13,816
Yeah!

938
00:56:13,851 --> 00:56:18,951
You're getting great definition right here.
The latissimus dorsi. It's really starting to pop.

939
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:22,050
Are you getting a good
stretch in your hip flexors?

940
00:56:22,935 --> 00:56:24,035
I gotta go.

941
00:56:26,477 --> 00:56:28,477
Bette came home just to be with me.

942
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,607
I don't know what I was thinking.

943
00:56:34,745 --> 00:56:35,745
Tina?

944
00:56:36,667 --> 00:56:41,167
I'm starting to see some private clients very
selectively. Let me know if you're interested.

945
00:56:41,387 --> 00:56:43,687
Yeah! I will.

946
00:56:51,027 --> 00:56:52,127
Goodnight.

947
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:55,114
Goodnight. I had a really great time.

948
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:57,310
Good. I'm glad.

949
00:56:58,231 --> 00:56:59,631
Have sweet dreams.

950
00:57:53,822 --> 00:57:57,222
Look, if you really want to go back
to Dan Foxworthy, that's fine by me.

951
00:57:58,443 --> 00:58:01,643
I'll make an appointment.
Tell me when you're free.

952
00:58:02,351 --> 00:58:04,651
Just make the appointment
and tell me when it is.

953
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,923
Tomorrow at 3:15.

954
00:58:07,957 --> 00:58:10,757
I was going to see him by myself
but I'd rather you come with me.

955
00:58:25,076 --> 00:58:26,676
To Jenny being in L.A.

956
00:58:27,247 --> 00:58:28,347
Cheers.

957
00:58:32,951 --> 00:58:34,651
I'm so glad you're here.

958
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,480
I missed you a lot.

959
00:58:37,592 --> 00:58:39,292
I've missed you, too.

960
00:58:40,449 --> 00:58:41,749
Aren't they cute?

961
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:43,118
Adorable.

962
00:58:46,925 --> 00:58:49,625
Allright, allright, allright. Let's order.

963
00:58:51,538 --> 00:58:52,838
Are you guys still fighting?

964
00:58:57,177 --> 00:58:58,977
I'll tell you what. Can you just get them to grill it?

965
00:58:58,978 --> 00:59:00,924
My wife doesn't seem to
think I need all that breading.

966
00:59:01,346 --> 00:59:05,246
You don't. He doesn't.
You're getting a paunch.

967
00:59:07,999 --> 00:59:09,499
Hey, look who's here.

968
00:59:15,126 --> 00:59:16,126
Hi.

969
00:59:16,192 --> 00:59:17,192
Man!

970
00:59:17,844 --> 00:59:20,844
That girl is so hot. She doesn't
really look like she's gay.

971
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:21,816
Randy.

972
00:59:21,817 --> 00:59:22,576
What?

973
00:59:22,577 --> 00:59:23,705
Marina's not gay, is she?

974
00:59:23,706 --> 00:59:24,877
I have no idea.

975
00:59:24,878 --> 00:59:28,236
Well, if she is... I think she's with
that blonde with the cute haircut.

976
00:59:28,237 --> 00:59:29,365
You think she's cute?

977
00:59:30,144 --> 00:59:33,144
Cute? Nah, I didn't say I wanted
to sleep with her, I just said she's -

978
00:59:33,145 --> 00:59:36,097
No, I like the one that looks like a rock star.

979
00:59:36,182 --> 00:59:37,582
If I had to be with a woman...

980
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:39,975
I think she'd be my type.

981
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:52,150
I have to use the bathroom.

982
00:59:55,053 --> 00:59:56,353
Wine's not bad, hm?

983
01:00:03,594 --> 01:00:04,894
What are you doing here?

984
01:00:06,291 --> 01:00:08,191
The same thing you're doing here, I imagine.

985
01:00:08,192 --> 01:00:10,241
Well, I'm finding it very distracting.

986
01:00:11,343 --> 01:00:12,443
Do you?

987
01:00:19,092 --> 01:00:20,792
I'd like to see you again.

988
01:00:26,256 --> 01:00:27,556
Stop it.

989
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:31,827
I have to go.

990
01:00:40,123 --> 01:00:42,723
Hey. Stopped at The Planet,
got you a cup of coffee.

991
01:00:46,144 --> 01:00:50,444
"She drifted across the
expanse, lifted the first veil. "

992
01:01:29,847 --> 01:01:31,147
I'm sorry.

993
01:01:34,901 --> 01:01:36,101
What's going on?

994
01:01:38,098 --> 01:01:39,798
I'm just a little tense.

995
01:01:41,326 --> 01:01:45,826
You go off to school every day and you
have your whole deal worked out, and...

996
01:01:50,938 --> 01:01:53,738
I'm not quite sure what I'm doing in L.A.

997
01:01:56,478 --> 01:01:58,078
I thought you were doing well.

998
01:01:58,358 --> 01:02:02,658
I mean, you're writing. You're
working, at a job that you wanted.

999
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:05,660
You even made a few new friends, right?

1000
01:02:05,661 --> 01:02:08,759
I just feel like it's kind of a little scary right now.

1001
01:02:09,888 --> 01:02:13,588
I'm feeling a bit, um, overwhelmed.

1002
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:15,970
Don't take it out on me.

1003
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:18,490
I'm not the enemy.

1004
01:02:18,961 --> 01:02:20,161
I know.

1005
01:02:26,803 --> 01:02:27,803
I know.

1006
01:02:30,558 --> 01:02:33,058
You couldn't be more supportive of me.

1007
01:02:40,684 --> 01:02:41,784
You wanna get that?

1008
01:02:53,344 --> 01:02:54,344
Hello?

1009
01:02:55,923 --> 01:02:56,923
Hi.

1010
01:02:58,291 --> 01:03:01,591
Uh... yeah. How are you?

1011
01:03:01,923 --> 01:03:03,323
Oh, okay.

1012
01:03:03,730 --> 01:03:05,130
Yes, no problem.

1013
01:03:05,986 --> 01:03:06,986
Okay.

1014
01:03:07,996 --> 01:03:08,996
Okay.

1015
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:12,340
Bye.

1016
01:03:15,277 --> 01:03:17,277
That was, uh, that was Marina.

1017
01:03:17,732 --> 01:03:20,232
We're gonna have dinner on Saturday night.

1018
01:03:21,329 --> 01:03:24,929
We don't have plans, do we,
because if we do, I can reschedule -

1019
01:03:25,455 --> 01:03:27,355
No, go ahead, it's fine.

1020
01:03:27,976 --> 01:03:31,076
We were just gonna get together and
we were gonna talk about the book club.

1021
01:03:32,603 --> 01:03:37,103
But Tim, I think I should call her back and tell her
that you and I need to spend some time together.

1022
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:42,264
Jenny, I have a basketball game with
the department heads Saturday night.

1023
01:03:42,875 --> 01:03:45,575
Go. Have dinner with Marina, it's fine.

1024
01:03:46,522 --> 01:03:47,622
Okay.

1025
01:03:54,353 --> 01:03:55,653
Thank you.

1026
01:04:04,691 --> 01:04:05,891
She said she was coming.

1027
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,920
It was kinda last-minute, though.

1028
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:12,039
So you think she might not be showing up?

1029
01:04:12,195 --> 01:04:13,295
I don't know.

1030
01:04:15,327 --> 01:04:18,127
Maybe we should spent a
little time talking about you.

1031
01:04:19,847 --> 01:04:22,347
I'm sorry I'm late. But I
have a really good excuse.

1032
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:27,779
So don't make this easy on me.

1033
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:32,249
I have found the perfect donor.

1034
01:04:32,417 --> 01:04:33,417
Who?

1035
01:04:33,423 --> 01:04:37,523
Marcus Allenwood, he's an artist, and he's
just been selected for the next Whitney Biennial.

1036
01:04:37,524 --> 01:04:39,028
I had a serious conversation with him.

1037
01:04:40,116 --> 01:04:41,216
But I've never met him.

1038
01:04:41,217 --> 01:04:45,003
No, but I know exactly what you and
I are looking for and he is so perfect,

1039
01:04:45,004 --> 01:04:47,564
he even has a kid so we know
he can get someone pregnant.

1040
01:04:47,878 --> 01:04:50,145
I never. Met. Him.

1041
01:04:50,946 --> 01:04:52,546
You will meet him tomorrow.

1042
01:04:52,547 --> 01:04:55,708
He's coming by the house at 11 and
you're taking him to the cryobank.

1043
01:04:57,754 --> 01:05:00,454
He's leaving the next day for
Cologne. He's a in a group show.

1044
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:08,575
Tee, he's willing to do this for us so we can have
the sperm on ice for when you're next ovulating.

1045
01:05:09,951 --> 01:05:11,851
It'll be there when we wanna use it.

1046
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:25,440
M - Marcus?

1047
01:05:25,496 --> 01:05:26,596
Tina, right?

1048
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:36,079
I have to get something out of
the bedroom, and uh, have a seat

1049
01:05:38,499 --> 01:05:40,999
And... and then we'll go to the... cryobank!

1050
01:05:41,373 --> 01:05:42,573
Okay.

1051
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:01,180
Fuck!

1052
01:06:19,569 --> 01:06:20,569
Ready?

1053
01:06:21,081 --> 01:06:24,181
Tina, did Bette not tell you I was black?

1054
01:06:24,298 --> 01:06:26,698
No. Not at all.

1055
01:06:27,536 --> 01:06:32,637
But, she didn't... not tell me, because
it doesn't matter either way! Right?

1056
01:06:32,672 --> 01:06:34,636
I can't answer that for you.

1057
01:06:34,778 --> 01:06:36,078
No.

1058
01:06:39,332 --> 01:06:41,032
Okay. You ready to go?

1059
01:06:41,033 --> 01:06:42,241
Let's do it.

1060
01:06:57,673 --> 01:06:58,673
Hi.

1061
01:06:59,459 --> 01:07:04,359
I'm Tina Kennard, and I'm here with
my friend. He's here to make a... deposit.

1062
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:06,060
Marcus, right?

1063
01:07:06,381 --> 01:07:07,381
That's right.

1064
01:07:07,382 --> 01:07:09,705
And it says here you've
recently been HIV tested.

1065
01:07:09,854 --> 01:07:11,454
I have all my paperwork.

1066
01:07:12,166 --> 01:07:13,666
Then here's all you need from me.

1067
01:07:13,954 --> 01:07:15,954
The bathroom is down the hall, on the left,

1068
01:07:15,955 --> 01:07:19,074
and there are magazines in there
if you need any encouragement.

1069
01:07:19,906 --> 01:07:21,206
I'll be right back.

1070
01:07:27,676 --> 01:07:31,076
Wow. That's a pretty serious decision to make.

1071
01:07:31,077 --> 01:07:32,108
Isn't it?

1072
01:07:32,458 --> 01:07:34,058
You must've given it a lot of thought.

1073
01:07:34,432 --> 01:07:37,532
'Cause really big men like that
tend to make really big babies.

1074
01:07:38,334 --> 01:07:40,134
You'll probably be looking at a C-section.

1075
01:07:42,006 --> 01:07:43,206
Hi.

1076
01:07:47,109 --> 01:07:48,009
What's up?

1077
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:49,063
Hey.

1078
01:07:49,381 --> 01:07:51,981
She's uh, she's in the back.

1079
01:07:55,601 --> 01:07:56,601
Bye.

1080
01:07:56,602 --> 01:07:57,937
See ya later.

1081
01:07:59,139 --> 01:08:00,139
Bye.

1082
01:08:02,364 --> 01:08:03,864
What's going on?

1083
01:08:05,176 --> 01:08:06,476
What are you doing here?

1084
01:08:07,007 --> 01:08:10,507
I got this... vague but
urgent message from Alice.

1085
01:08:11,739 --> 01:08:13,239
Oh, great.

1086
01:08:16,626 --> 01:08:19,126
You put me in a fucking awkward position.

1087
01:08:19,726 --> 01:08:22,826
How could you not tell me
that Marcus Allenwood is black?

1088
01:08:25,089 --> 01:08:29,489
God, I - I... I don't know,
I guess I - I should've, I...

1089
01:08:29,821 --> 01:08:33,121
I just didn't think it would be a
problem for you to use a black donor.

1090
01:08:34,811 --> 01:08:37,211
I didn't say I didn't want a black donor.

1091
01:08:38,054 --> 01:08:39,954
I just think we should've discussed it.

1092
01:08:41,472 --> 01:08:43,272
We absolutely discussed it, Tina.

1093
01:08:43,836 --> 01:08:46,736
Right in the very beginning, we said that
if you were going to be the birth mother,

1094
01:08:46,887 --> 01:08:49,587
that we should consider finding
an African-American donor,

1095
01:08:49,588 --> 01:08:52,688
that way the child would be more like our child.

1096
01:08:53,333 --> 01:08:55,333
But I wasn't prepared.

1097
01:08:56,178 --> 01:08:57,978
I don't understand. Other than...

1098
01:08:59,319 --> 01:09:03,119
being committed... to spending
the rest of your life with me...

1099
01:09:03,767 --> 01:09:05,967
what more do you need to do to prepare?

1100
01:09:07,715 --> 01:09:09,315
Look at me, Bette.

1101
01:09:09,649 --> 01:09:14,849
I don't feel qualified to be the mother
of a child who's half African-American.

1102
01:09:15,378 --> 01:09:17,978
I don't know what it means to be black.

1103
01:09:20,126 --> 01:09:22,526
I think I can make a
contribution in that department.

1104
01:09:22,723 --> 01:09:27,323
And don't you think, on top of
everything else, to also have two moms...

1105
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:30,764
that is a lot of otherness to put on one child.

1106
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:38,230
Your reaction to Marcus Allenwood,
however honest it might have been,

1107
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:41,207
comes across to Bette like
a rejection of her identity.

1108
01:09:41,814 --> 01:09:43,514
I - I love Bette.

1109
01:09:43,928 --> 01:09:46,528
I... I love who she is, I...

1110
01:09:47,282 --> 01:09:50,082
I just wasn't ready for how I would react.

1111
01:09:50,428 --> 01:09:52,128
Do you know what that says to me?

1112
01:09:52,197 --> 01:09:54,497
That we're not ready
to have children together?

1113
01:09:59,698 --> 01:10:07,198
"Because Sarah Schuster came down, and now
she reviles you, like you revile your own craving. "

1114
01:10:15,262 --> 01:10:16,562
What do you think?

1115
01:10:22,376 --> 01:10:24,176
You scare me sometimes.

1116
01:10:27,831 --> 01:10:30,131
I see you going right to that edge.

1117
01:10:32,489 --> 01:10:34,289
And I think I've lost you.

1118
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:38,190
And then you come back with...

1119
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,560
And I know why you have
to disappear on me like that.

1120
01:10:46,529 --> 01:10:49,829
I'm so fucking proud to have you in my life.

1121
01:10:59,770 --> 01:11:02,270
I'm so proud to have you in my life.

1122
01:11:05,195 --> 01:11:06,695
Do you know that?

1123
01:11:10,736 --> 01:11:14,136
There's something I wanted to
get this afternoon before my game.

1124
01:11:15,889 --> 01:11:17,189
I'm gonna go do that.

1125
01:11:49,901 --> 01:11:50,901
I don't know.

1126
01:11:51,976 --> 01:11:53,276
What time does Milk start?

1127
01:11:54,138 --> 01:11:55,938
Why don't you just ask Dana to go?

1128
01:11:56,736 --> 01:11:59,336
You know, you guys are just
going to have to work that out.

1129
01:12:00,264 --> 01:12:02,264
Well, I'm sure Shane's gonna be there.

1130
01:12:03,793 --> 01:12:04,993
Yeah, why not?

1131
01:12:05,495 --> 01:12:06,595
Of course she is.

1132
01:12:07,816 --> 01:12:08,816
Oh really?

1133
01:12:10,108 --> 01:12:11,908
Hold on. Where are you going?

1134
01:12:11,909 --> 01:12:13,041
I don't know.

1135
01:12:14,772 --> 01:12:16,672
Doesn't the program start at 7:30?

1136
01:12:17,207 --> 01:12:18,207
Yup.

1137
01:12:18,453 --> 01:12:21,353
You don't have to come. You
can go out with Alice and Shane.

1138
01:12:26,247 --> 01:12:28,247
Shit, you know what? I can't go.

1139
01:12:28,939 --> 01:12:31,539
Yeah, Bette's giving an art talk at the C.A.C.

1140
01:12:31,688 --> 01:12:33,788
Yeah. No. Allright.

1141
01:12:34,255 --> 01:12:35,955
Have fun. Bye.

1142
01:12:55,503 --> 01:12:58,403
When she looks at you, she's not looking
at a black woman or a white woman,

1143
01:12:58,404 --> 01:13:00,213
she's looking at the woman she loves.

1144
01:13:00,287 --> 01:13:01,687
She sees what she wants to see.

1145
01:13:01,688 --> 01:13:03,529
Maybe she sees what you let her see.

1146
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:10,279
I mean, maybe this wasn't important before,
maybe what's worked best for you all these years,

1147
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:13,614
you know, getting all your pretty things
and putting together your pretty life,

1148
01:13:13,615 --> 01:13:15,850
is that you let people see
what they want to see.

1149
01:13:15,851 --> 01:13:16,932
What are you trying to say?

1150
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:21,890
Nothin'! Just... maybe it's
been easier for you that way.

1151
01:13:22,954 --> 01:13:24,254
That's nice.

1152
01:13:24,804 --> 01:13:26,304
That's really nice.

1153
01:13:27,161 --> 01:13:28,661
Oh, come on, don't walk out!

1154
01:13:28,662 --> 01:13:32,383
Oh, come on girl, don't walk outta here!
Don't walk outta here like that!

1155
01:13:33,037 --> 01:13:34,937
We gotta stop doing this to each other!

1156
01:13:34,938 --> 01:13:36,082
We?

1157
01:13:36,958 --> 01:13:40,658
Okay. I gotta stop doing it. I'm
the one that always ran away.

1158
01:13:40,659 --> 01:13:42,294
Okay, but don't do what I did.

1159
01:13:42,336 --> 01:13:45,136
Stay, hear me out, because I'm not going
to say what you think I'm going to say.

1160
01:13:47,335 --> 01:13:51,535
There's only one thing that
cuts across all our realities.

1161
01:13:51,854 --> 01:13:55,554
It's love. The bridge between all our differences.

1162
01:13:56,935 --> 01:13:59,835
And you have so much love in your life.

1163
01:14:01,455 --> 01:14:03,155
Why are you trying to tear down that bridge?

1164
01:14:04,653 --> 01:14:05,653
Why?

1165
01:14:05,999 --> 01:14:07,299
I don't know.

1166
01:14:23,837 --> 01:14:25,137
So you called Shane, right?

1167
01:14:25,262 --> 01:14:26,362
I thought you did.

1168
01:14:27,164 --> 01:14:28,164
I thought you did!

1169
01:14:28,165 --> 01:14:29,161
I told you to call!

1170
01:14:29,165 --> 01:14:31,462
I swear you said you were calling.

1171
01:14:31,463 --> 01:14:32,278
No, I said you call!

1172
01:14:32,279 --> 01:14:33,569
Whatever. She'll be here. She'll be here!

1173
01:14:33,871 --> 01:14:38,971
How do we draw the line that signifies
whether an image reads as pornography?

1174
01:14:39,774 --> 01:14:44,574
I mean, who gets to say what
passes as art and what is obscenity?

1175
01:14:45,942 --> 01:14:50,842
The debate has been taken up by Laurie Papou
in a series of paintings entitled "A Group of Seven. "

1176
01:14:51,203 --> 01:14:52,403
Please welcome Laurie.

1177
01:15:00,477 --> 01:15:04,977
So Laurie, to what extent is this body
of work meant to be read as a narrative?

1178
01:15:05,623 --> 01:15:07,723
She's awesome. Your girlfriend.

1179
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:11,220
She is, isn't she?

1180
01:15:13,015 --> 01:15:14,615
Sometimes I forget.

1181
01:15:15,938 --> 01:15:18,738
You two - really beautiful couple.

1182
01:15:20,133 --> 01:15:21,133
I mean that.

1183
01:15:22,404 --> 01:15:24,204
You're really beautiful.

1184
01:15:26,998 --> 01:15:28,798
Why is it so depressing?

1185
01:15:29,355 --> 01:15:35,255
Because it's the same faces, night after night.
Week after week. Floating clubs, floating girls.

1186
01:15:37,851 --> 01:15:38,951
She's cute.

1187
01:15:39,206 --> 01:15:40,906
She's been with two of my exes.

1188
01:15:41,592 --> 01:15:43,392
Staying out of that vicious cycle.

1189
01:15:44,431 --> 01:15:45,531
It's amazing.

1190
01:15:45,730 --> 01:15:48,530
This is where I come when
I can't stand it anymore.

1191
01:15:50,858 --> 01:15:53,058
Sometimes when I can't sleep I...

1192
01:15:53,938 --> 01:15:57,138
...lie down right here and watch the sun rise.

1193
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:36,250
This is vulgar, I know, but
the two of you are just so...

1194
01:16:36,585 --> 01:16:37,785
fuckin' sexy!

1195
01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:39,355
No offense!

1196
01:16:39,390 --> 01:16:41,690
Uh, it's hard to take offense at that.

1197
01:16:42,210 --> 01:16:43,410
I'm gonna get a drink.

1198
01:16:43,664 --> 01:16:45,264
Can I get either of you anything?

1199
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:46,770
I'm good, thanks.

1200
01:16:47,264 --> 01:16:48,764
No thanks, I'm fine.

1201
01:16:52,899 --> 01:16:55,199
Is he...? He's hitting on us.

1202
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,400
He is.

1203
01:16:58,257 --> 01:17:00,557
God, that hasn't happened in a while.

1204
01:17:13,067 --> 01:17:14,567
I have a thought.

1205
01:17:16,352 --> 01:17:17,652
It might be crazy.

1206
01:17:17,987 --> 01:17:18,987
What?

1207
01:17:21,988 --> 01:17:23,788
I know you're ovulating.

1208
01:17:26,197 --> 01:17:27,797
Do you think he's attractive?

1209
01:17:30,006 --> 01:17:31,306
Is he a good artist?

1210
01:17:31,307 --> 01:17:32,507
Who cares.

1211
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:35,291
What about Dan Foxworthy?

1212
01:17:35,292 --> 01:17:36,548
Oh, fuck Dan Foxworthy.

1213
01:17:36,549 --> 01:17:40,160
I mean, it's our life, we don't need his
permission to do what we think is right for us.

1214
01:17:41,587 --> 01:17:42,687
And you're okay with...

1215
01:17:42,688 --> 01:17:44,918
I wanna have a baby with you.

1216
01:17:46,565 --> 01:17:50,465
And if we make it together, that's
enough for me to know that it's our baby.

1217
01:17:57,934 --> 01:17:58,734
Okay.

1218
01:17:58,735 --> 01:17:59,370
Yeah.

1219
01:17:59,371 --> 01:18:01,771
Yeah? You sure?

1220
01:18:01,892 --> 01:18:03,092
Yeah.

1221
01:18:06,962 --> 01:18:07,962
Ah, she's not my type,

1222
01:18:07,963 --> 01:18:10,990
yeah, she looks like she's been around the
block a few times, you know what I mean?

1223
01:18:11,342 --> 01:18:12,742
What's wrong with that?

1224
01:18:13,732 --> 01:18:16,432
Ooh, ooh, ooh. Now she's cute.

1225
01:18:16,922 --> 01:18:18,922
And I haven't seen her before, is it possible?

1226
01:18:19,393 --> 01:18:20,393
Fresh meat.

1227
01:18:20,394 --> 01:18:21,543
New blood.

1228
01:18:21,544 --> 01:18:23,489
Cris-pay!

1229
01:18:24,952 --> 01:18:26,052
Uh-uh.

1230
01:18:41,423 --> 01:18:43,123
Just look at me. Okay?

1231
01:21:17,332 --> 01:21:19,732
Tina, why don't you make Bette wet?

1232
01:22:07,323 --> 01:22:10,723
It'd be really nice if you made love to
Tina while I'm making love to you.

1233
01:22:13,973 --> 01:22:15,573
It's not gonna happen that way.

1234
01:22:16,122 --> 01:22:17,522
How's it gonna happen?

1235
01:22:20,552 --> 01:22:25,252
I think you should make love to
Tina, while Tina makes love to me.

1236
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:29,180
Okay. It's cool.

1237
01:22:32,966 --> 01:22:35,866
Why don't you two lie down.

1238
01:22:43,063 --> 01:22:44,263
What's that?

1239
01:22:45,144 --> 01:22:45,744
What?

1240
01:22:45,745 --> 01:22:46,798
In your hand.

1241
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:50,020
It's a condom. Otherwise known as a rubber.

1242
01:22:50,495 --> 01:22:51,695
What are you doing with it?

1243
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:54,220
Well, some would say I'm being considerate.

1244
01:22:55,034 --> 01:22:57,234
We, we don't want you to use it.

1245
01:22:58,988 --> 01:22:59,888
Why?

1246
01:23:00,119 --> 01:23:00,919
You don't have to.

1247
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:03,098
We just... we're okay.

1248
01:23:09,343 --> 01:23:12,143
Man! That's great.

1249
01:23:15,884 --> 01:23:17,884
Why is it whenever dykes
wanna have sex with a guy,

1250
01:23:17,885 --> 01:23:19,609
it's only because they're
trying to steal his sperm?

1251
01:23:22,502 --> 01:23:24,002
Ain't happening, guys.

1252
01:23:49,521 --> 01:23:50,521
Bye guys.

1253
01:23:50,597 --> 01:23:51,020
Bye.

1254
01:23:51,021 --> 01:23:52,721
See ya. Give me a call later.

1255
01:23:52,722 --> 01:23:53,751
Oh, yeah.

1256
01:23:58,161 --> 01:23:59,361
Wanna come to my place?

1257
01:24:01,845 --> 01:24:05,245
Oh. Please. I am not that desperate.

1258
01:24:06,149 --> 01:24:08,549
Fuck you, Alice, neither am I.

1259
01:24:09,318 --> 01:24:10,055
Dana...

1260
01:24:10,056 --> 01:24:10,855
What?

1261
01:24:10,856 --> 01:24:14,241
I'm just, I don't wanna be one of those
people who sleeps with her friends.

1262
01:24:14,395 --> 01:24:15,495
Neither do I!

1263
01:24:15,737 --> 01:24:17,637
Right, okay! Well, let's not have sex!

1264
01:24:17,638 --> 01:24:18,304
No, never!

1265
01:24:18,305 --> 01:24:18,705
Okay!

1266
01:24:18,706 --> 01:24:20,070
Never!

1267
01:24:25,490 --> 01:24:29,090
That was really... crazy.

1268
01:24:30,643 --> 01:24:32,943
No, I thought it was a genius plan.

1269
01:24:35,183 --> 01:24:36,183
You did?

1270
01:24:37,208 --> 01:24:38,308
Yeah.

1271
01:24:54,767 --> 01:24:56,467
Were you turned on by him?

1272
01:24:58,099 --> 01:24:59,199
No.

1273
01:25:08,629 --> 01:25:10,129
This is you.

1274
01:26:19,993 --> 01:26:22,493
Jenny? Is that you?

1275
01:26:22,905 --> 01:26:24,605
I'm coming.

1276
01:27:47,034 --> 01:27:48,434
You smell different.

1277
01:27:51,383 --> 01:27:52,483
What is it?

1278
01:27:56,493 --> 01:27:58,393
It's a new perfume.

1279
01:28:04,967 --> 01:28:06,967
I like the old one better.

1280
01:28:24,235 --> 01:28:26,935
Okay, okay. Allright. Let's do you. C'mere.

1281
01:28:27,461 --> 01:28:28,661
It'll be fun.

1282
01:28:29,756 --> 01:28:31,256
I haven't even put you on it.

1283
01:28:31,352 --> 01:28:34,352
Allright, this is ridiculous. I've only
slept with two girls my whole life.

1284
01:28:34,994 --> 01:28:37,394
And I swear to god, if you
repeat that I will have to kill you.

1285
01:28:39,113 --> 01:28:42,613
Don't worry. Your reputation
as a stud is totally safe with me.

1286
01:28:42,614 --> 01:28:43,241
Okay.

1287
01:28:43,242 --> 01:28:45,442
Okay. So.

1288
01:28:46,272 --> 01:28:47,372
Oh, god!

1289
01:28:47,373 --> 01:28:49,311
Okay. Name names.

1290
01:28:50,955 --> 01:28:53,255
Okay, there was the counselor
at tennis camp when I was fifteen.

1291
01:28:53,256 --> 01:28:53,891
Right.

1292
01:28:53,892 --> 01:28:55,073
Which you know about.

1293
01:28:55,428 --> 01:28:56,428
Name?

1294
01:28:59,081 --> 01:29:00,481
She's famous now. I can't tell you her name.

1295
01:29:00,482 --> 01:29:04,064
Oh, god. Okay. Ralph. I'll call her Ralph.

1296
01:29:04,088 --> 01:29:04,688
Okay.

1297
01:29:04,689 --> 01:29:06,556
Now. Second name.

1298
01:29:07,595 --> 01:29:08,695
Melanie.

1299
01:29:08,921 --> 01:29:11,121
Melanie? I knew it.

1300
01:29:12,913 --> 01:29:13,713
I told you about that.

1301
01:29:13,714 --> 01:29:15,961
No, you didn't. That's - okay.

1302
01:29:16,206 --> 01:29:20,306
Let's see how many people it
would take to link you and me.

1303
01:29:21,571 --> 01:29:23,271
Whatever, that's impossible.

1304
01:29:23,758 --> 01:29:24,658
Okay.

1305
01:29:25,236 --> 01:29:26,436
Melanie slept with Heather.

1306
01:29:26,437 --> 01:29:27,339
Okay.

1307
01:29:27,719 --> 01:29:29,819
Heather slept with Brooke.

1308
01:29:29,820 --> 01:29:30,935
Heather slept with Brooke?

1309
01:29:30,936 --> 01:29:35,968
Yes. Brooke slept with Nina,
and I slept with Nina. See that?

1310
01:29:36,003 --> 01:29:37,068
Wow, yeah.

1311
01:29:38,001 --> 01:29:41,901
So, four. One, two, three, four. That is
how many people it takes to link you to me.

1312
01:29:42,236 --> 01:29:44,236
Okay. Okay. So you and Tina...

1313
01:29:44,287 --> 01:29:45,487
Well that's easy.

1314
01:29:47,966 --> 01:29:52,066
Okay... Okay... I get it...

1315
01:29:52,087 --> 01:29:54,087
Ooh, ooh! Okay, I have a good one. Here.

1316
01:29:55,283 --> 01:29:56,283
Check it out.

1317
01:29:58,399 --> 01:29:59,199
Really good.

1318
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:01,961
Okay, now she... she leads
us right back to Shane.

1319
01:30:01,962 --> 01:30:02,590
Oh, god.

1320
01:30:02,591 --> 01:30:03,659
Right.

1321
01:30:04,108 --> 01:30:06,108
Now. She could have us here all night.

1322
01:30:06,135 --> 01:30:08,235
It's like this whole crazy, tiny little world.

1323
01:30:10,532 --> 01:30:11,732
Crazy, yes.

1324
01:30:12,426 --> 01:30:13,626
But not tiny.

1325
01:30:58,404 --> 01:31:00,704
I'm so lucky to have you.

1326
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:29,620
Come here.

1327
01:32:11,223 --> 01:32:12,323
Jen?

1328
01:32:16,754 --> 01:32:18,254
Jenny, you awake?

1329
01:32:18,806 --> 01:32:20,406
Oh my god.

1330
01:32:29,233 --> 01:32:30,633
Oh my god.

1331
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:36,370
Jen. Breakfast is ready.

1332
01:32:44,381 --> 01:32:46,181
Hey.

1333
01:32:47,315 --> 01:32:48,715
What are you doing up this early?

1334
01:32:51,837 --> 01:32:53,137
I'm going home.

1335
01:32:53,298 --> 01:32:54,298
From?

1336
01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:01,240
Nevermind.

1337
01:33:01,364 --> 01:33:02,464
Yeah.

1338
01:33:06,047 --> 01:33:07,947
You totally just got laid, didn't you?

1339
01:33:09,336 --> 01:33:13,336
Yeah, you see? That gives me hope,
because I love knowing that two people

1340
01:33:13,337 --> 01:33:17,435
who've been together for so long...
can still make each other that happy.

1341
01:33:23,663 --> 01:33:26,063
Yeah. Anyway. Um...

1342
01:33:26,608 --> 01:33:28,708
Have a good morning.

1343
01:33:29,048 --> 01:33:30,048
Okay.

1344
01:33:30,414 --> 01:33:31,414
I'm gonna go.

1345
01:33:31,711 --> 01:33:33,911
Okay. Bye, guys.

1346
01:33:34,026 --> 01:33:35,126
You be good.

1347
01:33:36,383 --> 01:33:37,383
I'm gonna try.

1348
01:33:37,724 --> 01:33:38,824
See ya.

1349
01:34:11,818 --> 01:34:16,818

The L Word - ep104 - Lies, Lies, Lies

3
00:00:46,127 --> 00:00:47,227
Hey, Helen.

4
00:00:47,296 --> 00:00:48,896
Stacy never came home.

5
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,440
You got a wild one on your hands,
Helen, you knew that going in.

6
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:54,135
You didn't run into
her at the Boiler Room?

7
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:57,054
No. I never saw her tonight.

8
00:00:58,043 --> 00:00:58,943
What's that?

9
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:01,841
I picked it up at that estate auction.

10
00:01:01,842 --> 00:01:07,332
I think it's a...  from Ecuador, about
500 A.D., some minor demon like...

11
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:09,415
Abraxas, or Forcas, or something...

12
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:10,301
Whatever.

13
00:01:10,302 --> 00:01:14,711
Listen, don't stress out about Stacy, you know
how she is. She probably went to another party...

14
00:01:14,712 --> 00:01:17,274
and is passed out on someone's couch.

15
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:18,702
Well, what if something happened to her?

16
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,769
Oh, I'm sure she's fine.

17
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:24,433
I'm waiting a few more hours,
then I'm going to the police.

18
00:01:42,763 --> 00:01:43,963
Who was that?

19
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:46,105
Your girlfriend.

20
00:02:15,963 --> 00:02:17,863
Hey. What're you doing here?

21
00:02:17,864 --> 00:02:19,246
Live here, last time I checked.

22
00:02:19,247 --> 00:02:20,537
I thought that you had practice.

23
00:02:20,538 --> 00:02:25,469
Oh, Randy's taking the practice... I'm trying
to... map out a study schedule for Trish.

24
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:30,292
If she doesn't pass Physics, she can't
compete in the PAC-Tens next month, so...

25
00:02:30,634 --> 00:02:33,434
Wow. You look fantastic.

26
00:02:33,435 --> 00:02:34,180
Really?

27
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:35,140
Where are you going?

28
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:42,135
I'm, I'm just... going to The Planet, gonna go
write. I need the change of environment. So...

29
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:43,533
I'll see you later.

30
00:02:43,534 --> 00:02:44,499
You know what?

31
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,840
That's a great idea.

32
00:02:47,965 --> 00:02:49,265
I'm going to come with you.

33
00:02:49,317 --> 00:02:51,217
I gotta get out of the house.

34
00:02:57,665 --> 00:02:59,965
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

35
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,439
It happens, Dana.

36
00:03:02,862 --> 00:03:04,762
It's never happened to me.

37
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:07,831
It's a perfectly natural thing.

38
00:03:08,936 --> 00:03:11,836
It doesn't change the
way I feel about you.

39
00:03:12,451 --> 00:03:15,151
Or how much pleasure you gave me.

40
00:03:35,104 --> 00:03:37,004
Ew! What is that?

41
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:38,462
Sandwich. Want some?

42
00:03:38,476 --> 00:03:39,876
Pass.

43
00:03:47,423 --> 00:03:48,822
Bye.

44
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,570
I'll be right back.

45
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,497
I can't believe you can buy these
things in bulk. It's so weird.

46
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,870
Oh, my God. I'd have so much more respect
for that box if it had more honest pictures.

47
00:05:04,912 --> 00:05:08,612
Like, some sobbing, infertile woman
with a negative test stick in her hand.

48
00:05:09,765 --> 00:05:13,707
And on the other side, it could have a teenage
girl with a positive one, about to hang herself.

49
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:14,108
Yeah.

50
00:05:14,187 --> 00:05:15,187
Good.

51
00:05:32,507 --> 00:05:33,807
How do you not pee on your hand?

52
00:05:33,853 --> 00:05:35,553
You just aim below the clit.

53
00:05:35,594 --> 00:05:36,794
Oh, really?

54
00:05:36,888 --> 00:05:39,288
Yeah. Where did you think pee came out of?

55
00:05:39,362 --> 00:05:41,362
I don't know, there's a
lot going on down there.

56
00:05:42,068 --> 00:05:44,168
This is my tenth early pregnancy test.

57
00:05:44,986 --> 00:05:49,286
In high school, I used to think you could
get pregnant from giving a guy a blow-job.

58
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:51,459
I used to think you could get
pregnant through your pants.

59
00:05:51,937 --> 00:05:53,737
Or touching the handle
of the boys' bathroom.

60
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,759
Are you sure you want to go back to men?

61
00:05:56,844 --> 00:06:01,544
I'm positive. I've had enough drama and
mind-fucks, and women are fucking crazy.

62
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:02,836
Yeah, men are boring.

63
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:07,549
Yeah, well bring it on, because I could
use a little nice, uncomplicated, boring,

64
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,704
boy-girl sex masquerading
as love. It's fine with me.

65
00:06:55,555 --> 00:06:56,555
Jen?

66
00:06:57,127 --> 00:06:58,127
Tim?

67
00:06:58,354 --> 00:06:59,354
You alright?

68
00:06:59,422 --> 00:07:01,822
Yeah, I'm good.

69
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:03,818
You sure?

70
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:04,852
Yeah.

71
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,940
Yeah, hey.

72
00:07:10,674 --> 00:07:13,874
I hate these unisex bathrooms.

73
00:07:14,068 --> 00:07:19,268
You know? It's shocking to hear a man's
voice, and they pee everywhere, it's just...

74
00:07:20,335 --> 00:07:22,335
completely gross.

75
00:07:22,336 --> 00:07:24,312
I'll try and be considerate.

76
00:07:42,468 --> 00:07:46,868
You know what? It makes me sick what this
administration is doing to our environment.

77
00:07:47,143 --> 00:07:50,243
Oh my God. Oh God, oh my God! Tina!

78
00:07:50,814 --> 00:07:51,714
It's positive!

79
00:07:51,715 --> 00:07:52,748
What?

80
00:07:54,178 --> 00:07:57,378
Oh... oh, my God!

81
00:07:58,428 --> 00:07:59,428
I'm pregnant.

82
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,359
You did it, you did it, you did it!

83
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,795
Oh, my God!

84
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:06,168
I'm pregnant! Oh, my God!

85
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:09,314
You did it! I'm so happy for you!

86
00:08:10,645 --> 00:08:14,345
Oh, my God, look, I'm a clich×™.
I'm sitting here stuffing my face!

87
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:16,042
Hey guys!

88
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:18,999
Oh, God, you scared
me. Kit, c'mere! C'mere!

89
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:20,959
Tina's pregnant.

90
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:24,641
We just found out, just this second. Look!

91
00:08:24,815 --> 00:08:27,515
Wow, oh, wow!

92
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:35,640
Oh, oh, I... I'm so happy for you!
This is great! Wow, this is groovy.

93
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:37,030
Does Bette know?

94
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,699
Jen, I have to run these
study plans over to Trish.

95
00:08:40,727 --> 00:08:42,627
Okay. That's fine.

96
00:08:45,337 --> 00:08:46,337
Hello?

97
00:08:47,978 --> 00:08:49,078
Oh, hey.

98
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,330
Uh, no, no she didn't mention that.

99
00:08:53,602 --> 00:08:59,502
Really, yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway.
You probably want to talk to Jenny.

100
00:09:01,231 --> 00:09:03,131
The great Nick Brashkov.

101
00:09:04,518 --> 00:09:05,518
You sure you want this?

102
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,036
Shut up, give me the phone.

103
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:08,798
Hello?

104
00:09:09,993 --> 00:09:12,193
Hi. How are you?

105
00:09:14,497 --> 00:09:15,697
Guess what.

106
00:09:16,885 --> 00:09:19,285
I killed Sarah Schuster.

107
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:22,153
You promise?

108
00:09:22,358 --> 00:09:23,958
Well, you know I promise.

109
00:09:24,594 --> 00:09:25,794
I'm not worried about you.

110
00:09:25,795 --> 00:09:28,643
Yes, I promise, I won't tell Bette
that we knew it before she knew.

111
00:09:28,644 --> 00:09:33,221
You're gonna have to be so good.
You can't have any more fun, uh-uh!

112
00:09:33,222 --> 00:09:39,961
I know. No red meat, no additives,
no Margaritas, wine, beer...

113
00:09:40,825 --> 00:09:43,425
and no Xanax! No matter
how stressed-out I get.

114
00:09:43,426 --> 00:09:46,860
No more smack, no more
crack, and no more blow.

115
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:51,771
I'm going to do everything right. I'm going to
be as together about this as Bette is to her work.

116
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,775
We're going to have a family.

117
00:09:57,648 --> 00:09:58,848
Oh, my God.

118
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:00,769
Well, I have to go.

119
00:10:01,596 --> 00:10:03,296
So, I'll talk to you later.

120
00:10:04,099 --> 00:10:05,999
Lips are sealed, promise.

121
00:10:06,484 --> 00:10:11,084
Tina, um, the reason I came is Bette
told me there was a letter here for me?

122
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:14,256
Oh! Yeah! That's right. I'm sorry.

123
00:10:16,945 --> 00:10:18,345
It's from David.

124
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:26,629
You okay?

125
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:31,925
Wow... yeah. I haven't
heard from him in 5 years.

126
00:10:34,075 --> 00:10:39,475
Okay! You and Bette are
gonna be great parents.

127
00:10:39,476 --> 00:10:40,463
Thanks, baby.

128
00:10:40,464 --> 00:10:44,104
Now, go on! Go call her before
you explode! I'm outta here!

129
00:10:47,762 --> 00:10:50,662
I was completely done with her,
so I just decided she needed to go.

130
00:10:52,524 --> 00:10:54,824
Oh, Nick, of course I value your opinion.

131
00:10:55,938 --> 00:10:57,438
You were the first!

132
00:10:58,286 --> 00:11:01,486
You are? Okay.

133
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:05,815
Yes, I would love to! I would
absa-absa-absolutely love to.

134
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,667
You have a tan?

135
00:11:10,296 --> 00:11:12,796
Oh, my God, do you still
look like George Hamilton?

136
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,430
I understand your concerns.

137
00:11:18,431 --> 00:11:21,518
The, uh, Bill Viola went to
Seattle, he could maybe do 2005.

138
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,123
Tina. Still on line 3.

139
00:11:23,206 --> 00:11:24,206
Thank you.

140
00:11:24,987 --> 00:11:29,487
Yes, great talking to you,
too. Okay. Alright, bye.

141
00:11:30,744 --> 00:11:32,244
Baby, I cannot talk right now.

142
00:11:32,245 --> 00:11:34,307
Okay, okay. I'll make it really quick.

143
00:11:34,413 --> 00:11:38,413
Just promise me that you'll come
home for dinner tonight. I'm cooking.

144
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:39,717
That's gonna be a tough one to swing.

145
00:11:39,718 --> 00:11:44,364
Please, it's really important. I'll take
care of you. I'll make it all better.

146
00:11:44,365 --> 00:11:49,123
The only way you can make it all better is if you
come up with a show for my big, gaping spring slot.

147
00:11:50,314 --> 00:11:51,414
Sheldon Tomlin's on 2.

148
00:11:51,415 --> 00:11:52,600
Fuck Sheldon Tomlin!

149
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:54,077
Baby, I can't talk right now.

150
00:11:54,137 --> 00:11:56,937
I will try tonight, that
is the best I can do. Okay?

151
00:11:56,938 --> 00:11:58,721
Okay. Try.

152
00:11:58,721 --> 00:12:00,821
Okay. Bye.

153
00:12:08,713 --> 00:12:12,113
Sheldon! Thank you so
much for calling me back.

154
00:12:12,661 --> 00:12:17,861
Y
- no, it's true. Well, you know, MOCA is a big institution, it's hard to compete.

155
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,566
Look, um, the reason
that I was calling you...

156
00:12:21,806 --> 00:12:25,906
What you're about to hear is the sound
of me eating my words. Sheldon, I...

157
00:12:26,335 --> 00:12:32,035
would like to book "Impressions In Winter" and
I hope that you don't hold it against me that...

158
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,696
Franklin didn't tell me anything.

159
00:12:38,305 --> 00:12:42,905
That is absolutely not true.
No, the C.A.C. is not in turmoil!

160
00:12:44,762 --> 00:12:49,562
No! Of course. You know, and
nothing personal on my part, either.

161
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:52,167
Okay. Bye.

162
00:12:52,782 --> 00:12:54,182
Franklin headed this way.

163
00:12:54,715 --> 00:12:58,215
God, dammit, does it ever fucking stop?

164
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:01,716
She in?

165
00:13:01,717 --> 00:13:03,143
Uh, no, not yet.

166
00:13:03,927 --> 00:13:05,027
I see.

167
00:13:05,136 --> 00:13:08,636
Would you tell her that the board is convening
for an unscheduled meeting tomorrow evening?

168
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:11,567
And she would be well-advised to attend.

169
00:13:12,436 --> 00:13:14,536
Franklin! What are you
doing talking to my door?

170
00:13:14,537 --> 00:13:16,297
I'm off to my Bernard Riddle meeting.

171
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:18,638
He's got half a million dollars
he wants to lay on some museum,

172
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,656
somewhere in Los Angeles that's
doing anything remotely progressive.

173
00:13:21,657 --> 00:13:24,460
Bernard Riddle? He's way
out of your league, dear.

174
00:13:24,818 --> 00:13:28,818
He may be out of the C.A.C.'s league,
Franklin, but he's certainly not out of mine.

175
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:39,848
Okay, guys. I just saw the cutest
guy I've ever seen in my life.

176
00:13:40,817 --> 00:13:41,717
What?

177
00:13:41,859 --> 00:13:43,059
I don't wanna talk about it.

178
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,397
You don't want to talk about what?
Something happen with you and Lara?

179
00:13:46,398 --> 00:13:49,044
No. I'm just never having
sex again, that's all.

180
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:50,432
Easy, Dana, come on.

181
00:13:50,616 --> 00:13:55,416
I've never been more humiliated or embarrassed
or ashamed of anything in my entire life.

182
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,596
What, did she tie you up and leave you?

183
00:13:58,049 --> 00:13:59,549
No, nothing like that.

184
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:04,557
Okay, okay. Yep. I have a friend, she went down
on a girl, she was down there and she sneezed.

185
00:14:04,558 --> 00:14:05,636
Is that it?

186
00:14:06,984 --> 00:14:07,984
Gross.

187
00:14:07,985 --> 00:14:12,423
It wasn't me, it was a friend. So what,
what what what. God, you're killing me.

188
00:14:13,473 --> 00:14:14,754
Did you queef?

189
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:17,954
Did I... see, I don't
even know what that is.

190
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:19,629
Is that...

191
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,770
Okay, is that what happened?

192
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:30,391
She female-ejaculated.

193
00:14:31,648 --> 00:14:33,448
Wow, Miss Dana.

194
00:14:33,669 --> 00:14:36,269
Wow, this Lara must be
a killer in bed, huh?

195
00:14:36,422 --> 00:14:39,622
Yeah... uh, yeah, yeah... she...

196
00:14:40,368 --> 00:14:41,407
That's a good thing?

197
00:14:41,408 --> 00:14:45,808
Dana! Women strive for this!
They read books about the G-spot.

198
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:49,561
They go to workshops. Oh, my God, you
should be totally and utterly ecstatic.

199
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:54,778
Oh, my God, there he is. Tell me he's
not the cutest guy you've ever seen?

200
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:56,008
Oh, Lis!

201
00:14:56,127 --> 00:14:57,127
Shane!

202
00:14:57,325 --> 00:15:00,225
Hey! How are you doing? How are you?

203
00:15:00,904 --> 00:15:06,404
Um, these are my friends. This is Alice,
and this is Dana. Guys, this is Lisa.

204
00:15:06,413 --> 00:15:07,413
Hi.

205
00:15:08,156 --> 00:15:08,956
Lisa?

206
00:15:08,957 --> 00:15:09,773
That's Lisa.

207
00:15:09,774 --> 00:15:13,176
Oh, shit. Oh, God, it's
my mother. Excuse me.

208
00:15:13,177 --> 00:15:16,759
Hello, mother. What do you mean you're in L.A., wh
- where are you?

209
00:15:19,691 --> 00:15:20,891
Who is that?

210
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:22,999
Forget it, man.

211
00:15:23,141 --> 00:15:24,241
Are you sure?

212
00:15:24,242 --> 00:15:25,942
Yeah, she, uh...

213
00:15:26,242 --> 00:15:29,042
well, she doesn't want
to be a lesbian anymore.

214
00:15:29,338 --> 00:15:30,238
Since when?

215
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:34,137
Well, she was dating one of
those hot-and-cold chicks, and...

216
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:36,725
well, she got her heart completely busted.

217
00:15:36,726 --> 00:15:42,619
No! I... okay. I can't come because I have to go to
w... I have to go to work in, like, a half an hour.

218
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:43,858
It's a shame.

219
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:44,832
Yeah.

220
00:15:45,205 --> 00:15:47,205
That's no reason to
swear off being a lesbian.

221
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:48,228
I agree.

222
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,547
Maybe I can change her mind.

223
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:55,975
Wait. I'm sorry, I don't think... I don't
know if you've noticed, but you're a guy.

224
00:15:56,436 --> 00:15:57,836
Lisa's a lesbian.

225
00:15:58,826 --> 00:16:01,126
I'm a lesbian-identified man.

226
00:16:03,035 --> 00:16:04,335
I know.

227
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:12,240
Okay. Well, my mom's at The Plaza,
there's been some sort of misunderstanding,

228
00:16:12,241 --> 00:16:13,935
and she's been here for 5 fucking days.

229
00:16:13,951 --> 00:16:15,551
Well, tell her I said hi.

230
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:17,534
Hey, is she still with that stunt guy?

231
00:16:17,587 --> 00:16:18,587
Ask her.

232
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,900
Bye, Alice.

233
00:16:22,798 --> 00:16:23,598
Bye...

234
00:16:23,821 --> 00:16:26,521
Bye... it's... mom... she's totally...

235
00:16:26,522 --> 00:16:28,326
I totally understand.

236
00:16:34,219 --> 00:16:36,019
Okay guys, I'll see ya later.

237
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,593
Bye, Al.

238
00:16:41,173 --> 00:16:47,473
Sweetie! I was planning on calling
you tomorrow. Oh, it's been so crazy.

239
00:16:47,655 --> 00:16:52,955
I'm here for the new Gerard Lichtman film
and he's just been so demanding of my time.

240
00:16:52,956 --> 00:16:54,803
Did you know he has 5 Standard poodles?

241
00:16:54,804 --> 00:16:56,533
Gerard Lichtman, wow, really.

242
00:16:56,533 --> 00:17:00,433
Yeah. Of course, they haven't
set up the production offices yet,

243
00:17:00,434 --> 00:17:04,477
the financing is coming from
some Australian beer conglomerate.

244
00:17:04,478 --> 00:17:09,335
So, I'm covering the hotel myself, which is
fine, except that, uh, I'm having a slight...

245
00:17:09,336 --> 00:17:13,552
cash flow problem at the moment, and
this manager's being a total dick.

246
00:17:13,553 --> 00:17:18,444
Excuse me. I'm a huge fan of
Dynasty. I loved you as Alexis!

247
00:17:18,445 --> 00:17:21,841
Thank you. Actually, I
was Blair in Empire Falls.

248
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:24,610
Moron.

249
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:27,230
Mom. I have to go to
work. So what do you want.

250
00:17:27,231 --> 00:17:31,271
Oh, Alice, please, can't you talk
to him for me? He's exhausted me.

251
00:17:32,821 --> 00:17:36,321
Okay. Alright. Stay here
and I will take care of this.

252
00:17:43,211 --> 00:17:44,811
So, all her credit cards were declined?

253
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:47,859
I'm afraid so. We have to
collect, she's over our limit.

254
00:17:48,225 --> 00:17:52,825
Right. But she'll have it in like a day or two.
She's here to be in a Gerard Lichtman film, so...

255
00:17:52,826 --> 00:17:53,431
Really?

256
00:17:53,432 --> 00:17:54,273
Yeah.

257
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,927
I loved Blaunacht. It should've
won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film.

258
00:17:56,928 --> 00:18:00,038
Right. And you know, sometimes they
start payroll after production started.

259
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:03,266
I'm sure you guys deal with
celebrities all the time. So...

260
00:18:03,267 --> 00:18:06,846
I know. But, uh... she's at our limit.

261
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:09,447
Right.

262
00:18:10,432 --> 00:18:13,432
Okay. I mean, I can take care
of this, it's not a problem.

263
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:16,471
So what are we looking at?

264
00:18:16,472 --> 00:18:18,412
Well, I have a printout of the bill.

265
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:21,958
The total comes to five thousand,
nine hundred sixty-eight, forty-two.

266
00:18:22,912 --> 00:18:23,912
I'm s... I'm sorry, you said...

267
00:18:23,913 --> 00:18:27,961
5.968,42

268
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:29,609
Dollars.

269
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,764
That be cash or credit card?

270
00:18:30,765 --> 00:18:34,940
I'm sorry. How could anybody spend five
thousand dollars on a hotel room. That doesn't...

271
00:18:34,941 --> 00:18:37,099
Well, the suite is $950 a night.

272
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:42,311
Uh, she was here for five days. There was room
service, and I believe she made a few phone calls.

273
00:18:44,252 --> 00:18:45,352
Right.

274
00:18:48,352 --> 00:18:50,052
Oh, mother.

275
00:18:50,141 --> 00:18:54,141
Well, obviously I'm good for the
money! I'm not some sort of con-artist!

276
00:18:54,451 --> 00:18:57,751
As soon as this job comes
through, just send me the bill.

277
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,075
You could always hawk those pants.

278
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,444
Aren't they great?

279
00:19:09,334 --> 00:19:11,334
Are you being sarcastic?

280
00:19:57,851 --> 00:20:01,051
So, uh... Nick is in town, huh?

281
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:04,835
It's the MLA convention.

282
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:08,030
I told him that we were getting
married and you know what he said?

283
00:20:08,145 --> 00:20:09,745
"Congratulations".

284
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,300
Really?

285
00:20:11,301 --> 00:20:12,458
You know what?

286
00:20:12,918 --> 00:20:20,618
Nick Brashkov is, like, this pretentious
asshole who milks his minor literary stature

287
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:24,505
by fucking these
impressionable, young undergrads.

288
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:29,634
Okay, you have to give me
some more credit. Please?

289
00:20:47,016 --> 00:20:50,816
Y... you know the men's slalom's on.
I've been waiting all night for this.

290
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:52,806
Oh, I'm sorry.

291
00:20:53,202 --> 00:20:54,802
Yeah. Okay.

292
00:21:02,298 --> 00:21:03,798
Come on.

293
00:22:12,657 --> 00:22:13,857
Where are you?

294
00:22:18,633 --> 00:22:20,233
I'm right... I'm right here.

295
00:22:20,234 --> 00:22:21,809
You look like you're someplace else.

296
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:24,860
No, no, I'm right here.

297
00:22:24,988 --> 00:22:25,588
Really?

298
00:22:25,589 --> 00:22:29,291
Yeah. C'mere. It's okay.

299
00:22:47,352 --> 00:22:50,552
I am fucking dying out there!

300
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,760
These Philistines are just breaking my -

301
00:22:57,729 --> 00:23:02,229
No. Tina... you invited someone to dinner?

302
00:23:02,961 --> 00:23:07,661
I've had the worst fucking day, the last thing
on earth I want to do is to have to make con -

303
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:49,399
I love you. I love you.
I love you. I love you.

304
00:23:51,465 --> 00:23:53,065
I love you.

305
00:23:53,294 --> 00:23:54,694
I love you.

306
00:24:05,421 --> 00:24:10,021
I called Dr. Wilson and she said we should
come in tomorrow, for an ultra-sound.

307
00:24:11,157 --> 00:24:13,057
Just to confirm the results.

308
00:24:13,848 --> 00:24:16,348
I am sorry I was such an asshole.

309
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:19,322
I'm sorry you had such a bad day.

310
00:24:19,805 --> 00:24:22,205
I'm sure everything is gonna be okay.

311
00:24:22,508 --> 00:24:23,808
Sure it will.

312
00:24:24,068 --> 00:24:25,068
Yeah.

313
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,980
We're gonna have a baby.

314
00:24:28,255 --> 00:24:31,655
We are. We are.

315
00:24:33,632 --> 00:24:35,032
I love you.

316
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:37,225
I love you, too.

317
00:24:38,214 --> 00:24:40,814
I tell you, you're good with
your mama, you're good all over.

318
00:24:40,815 --> 00:24:43,307
AI. Alright, just give me a triple shot.

319
00:24:44,964 --> 00:24:49,364
You guys, my mother's living with me
until her job starts and it's not fun.

320
00:24:49,642 --> 00:24:50,742
Wow.

321
00:24:50,754 --> 00:24:52,354
What's with Mopey Pants?

322
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:55,598
What is it, Dana, are you having
embarrassing multiple orgasms now?

323
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:56,667
No.

324
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:01,114
Just, Lara hasn't called
me. And it's been, like...

325
00:25:01,736 --> 00:25:03,236
It's been 21 hours.

326
00:25:03,237 --> 00:25:04,365
Well, how'd you leave it?

327
00:25:04,366 --> 00:25:05,639
I left without saying anything.

328
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,659
From your own apartment.

329
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,957
I was really embarrassed, Alice!

330
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,726
James, I really don't think they're
going to do that. You didn't do anything.

331
00:25:13,727 --> 00:25:18,305
If they do, I'll just make a bunch of phone calls
and give you an amazing recommendation, okay?

332
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:21,987
I like your scarf.

333
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:24,340
And this is for the baby.
I made it just for you.

334
00:25:24,537 --> 00:25:25,837
Congratulations.

335
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:34,320
Alright, I know. Ok, I was excited
and just... congratulations.

336
00:25:34,321 --> 00:25:37,035
Seriously, guys, it's
so amazing. Congrats.

337
00:25:37,346 --> 00:25:40,746
Wait, wait, wait. What's happening?
Why's everybody congratulating you guys?

338
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:43,106
Tina's having a baby. They're pregnant!

339
00:25:43,107 --> 00:25:45,906
Oh, my God. Congratulations!

340
00:25:45,907 --> 00:25:46,989
Wow!

341
00:25:47,555 --> 00:25:49,155
Am I always the last to know these things?

342
00:25:49,156 --> 00:25:51,911
It's okay, Dana. I
was second-to-last.

343
00:26:00,873 --> 00:26:02,273
Check it out.

344
00:26:07,423 --> 00:26:09,323
This is where you take the flower.

345
00:26:10,684 --> 00:26:12,284
C'mere, I'm sorry.

346
00:26:17,935 --> 00:26:19,135
God.

347
00:26:19,981 --> 00:26:21,581
So fucking cute.

348
00:26:21,898 --> 00:26:23,098
Yuck.

349
00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:27,539
Yeah, well you could have waited until
she left to do the pregnancy test.

350
00:26:28,658 --> 00:26:30,658
Maybe you want Alice to
be your Lamaze partner too,

351
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:34,710
and in fact, you know, really I'm surprised you
didn't invite her to come with us for the ultra-sound.

352
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,620
I'm sorry.

353
00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:55,419
Look, I know how stressed you
are. I'm trying to leave you alone.

354
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,540
But sometimes I need someone to share
a moment with. Is that really so wrong?

355
00:27:01,097 --> 00:27:02,197
No.

356
00:27:03,118 --> 00:27:04,518
It's sad.

357
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,397
Alright, ladies, let's keep it moving!

358
00:27:15,706 --> 00:27:18,506
I'm so sorry. I had to beg
Durst to make up my physics exam.

359
00:27:18,507 --> 00:27:22,035
Turn right back around, Trish. You don't
come to practice on time, don't bother coming.

360
00:27:22,036 --> 00:27:22,650
But, Tim, I was... 

361
00:27:22,651 --> 00:27:26,227
What? You're grown-up, right? Why
don't you take some responsibility?

362
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,883
All these women are in
the water already. Go on.

363
00:27:32,888 --> 00:27:35,288
Tim, what the hell are you
doing? Get her in the water, now!

364
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:38,043
Randy, she's fucking up. We can't
just let her set her own schedule...

365
00:27:38,044 --> 00:27:39,658
Trish! Get back here!

366
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,990
Go get her.

367
00:27:47,356 --> 00:27:48,756
Trish...

368
00:28:08,805 --> 00:28:09,805
What?

369
00:28:11,092 --> 00:28:14,992
Is that what you called to tell me?
I can't hear that right now. Okay?

370
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:16,902
Are you ready?

371
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:17,595
Yeah.

372
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:18,710
Bye.

373
00:28:28,425 --> 00:28:33,125
So, we'll just apply a little
bit of lubricant here...

374
00:28:36,569 --> 00:28:37,869
and here we go.

375
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,380
You comfortable?

376
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:46,807
Alright.

377
00:28:50,284 --> 00:28:52,784
And there's your left ovary.

378
00:28:53,713 --> 00:28:57,913
And that looks like it would've
been a follicle. And there...

379
00:28:58,292 --> 00:28:59,892
You see that little heartbeat?

380
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,460
Is that our baby?

381
00:29:06,515 --> 00:29:07,815
That's your baby.

382
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:10,567
Oh, God.

383
00:29:13,403 --> 00:29:14,903
Oh, my God.

384
00:29:19,697 --> 00:29:21,397
Oh, my God.

385
00:29:26,185 --> 00:29:27,585
Left on third.

386
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:32,568
Gerard is insisting on spending
the entire afternoon with me.

387
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:36,305
Last time I saw him, my God,
we talked about everything:

388
00:29:36,647 --> 00:29:40,147
films that inspired him
as a child in Berlin...

389
00:29:40,504 --> 00:29:41,904
my divorce... 

390
00:29:41,983 --> 00:29:44,783
it was as if we'd known
each other for years.

391
00:29:44,829 --> 00:29:45,729
Left, left!

392
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:49,156
Mom! I've lived in this city my
whole life, I know how to get to Pico!

393
00:29:49,157 --> 00:29:50,401
God!

394
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:53,797
We wouldn't have been late if you
hadn't spent 15 minutes in the bathroom.

395
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,180
Do I look okay? Huh?

396
00:29:58,181 --> 00:30:01,368
Good, you look great. You do.

397
00:30:02,143 --> 00:30:03,443
You really do.

398
00:30:04,745 --> 00:30:07,245
You could take a little more
time with your face, you know.

399
00:30:07,774 --> 00:30:09,874
You might have a girlfriend by now.

400
00:30:13,523 --> 00:30:15,123
Mother fucker! Asshole!

401
00:30:15,288 --> 00:30:17,388
God! Jesus!

402
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:23,663
Knock 'em dead, mom.

403
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,405
Don't worry so much.

404
00:30:25,469 --> 00:30:29,869
You're getting this big wrinkle. You're
starting to look like Ernest Borgnine.

405
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:26,993
Sign in at the front desk,
they'll give you sides.

406
00:31:28,013 --> 00:31:29,113
What is this?

407
00:31:29,433 --> 00:31:34,133
It's an open call for the part of Mrs. Simons,
alien 1, 2 and 3, and Ted's grandmother.

408
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:39,420
"Curse of the Romalians: Return to
Gondor Part 2." Is this a Lichtman film?

409
00:31:39,867 --> 00:31:42,367
Gerard Lichtman. The German director.

410
00:31:42,522 --> 00:31:46,322
The director is Matt Fried,
he's 22 and he's from Pasadena.

411
00:31:46,675 --> 00:31:48,875
Plus, he's a total asshole.

412
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,120
Hey, man. Can I talk to you for a second?

413
00:32:35,091 --> 00:32:36,691
About what? Trish?

414
00:32:36,692 --> 00:32:39,649
Yeah, well, look. Trish
needs support right now.

415
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,546
She doesn't need to be chewed
out in front of the whole team.

416
00:32:42,236 --> 00:32:46,221
Yeah? Well, I don't, either.
I'm just trying to do my job.

417
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:49,421
You're right. Look, man, I'm
sorry if I was harsh out there, but

418
00:32:49,473 --> 00:32:51,673
this is the reality of our situation.

419
00:32:51,757 --> 00:32:55,357
Without Trish Peverell, we shouldn't
bother showing up next week.

420
00:32:55,997 --> 00:32:56,797
Really?

421
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:00,652
And on that note, I got ahold of the physics
midterm. She's gonna take it on Monday.

422
00:33:01,178 --> 00:33:04,178
There's no way I'm just
turning that test over to Trish.

423
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:06,719
Would you relax? No one
is talking about cheating.

424
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,916
I'm talking about giving you the test
so that you know how to tutor her.

425
00:33:11,063 --> 00:33:14,663
Know what direction to lead
her in, that's all. C'mon.

426
00:33:18,077 --> 00:33:20,377
You are a tense man,
right now, you know that?

427
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:25,516
Listen, why don't we go get a couple
of beers, chill out a bit? It's on me.

428
00:33:25,575 --> 00:33:26,423
I can't.

429
00:33:26,423 --> 00:33:27,823
What, you and Jenny got plans?

430
00:33:27,884 --> 00:33:31,584
No. Jenny's going out to dinner
with one of her old professors.

431
00:33:32,527 --> 00:33:33,927
Oh!

432
00:33:34,592 --> 00:33:35,592
Wait.

433
00:33:35,869 --> 00:33:39,369
Not the blow-job one? The one
she wrote that story about?

434
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:44,220
Oh, hell no! You're letting your fianc×™e go
out with a dude whose dick's been in her mouth?

435
00:33:44,221 --> 00:33:46,085
Don't fucking say that!

436
00:33:55,322 --> 00:33:57,522
I don't own her, alright,
she's her own woman.

437
00:33:57,523 --> 00:34:02,190
No, she's not. Not since she put that
ring on her finger and said "yes".

438
00:34:02,339 --> 00:34:04,339
Man, you have got to put your foot down.

439
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:05,393
No.

440
00:34:06,008 --> 00:34:08,108
The whole caveman
thing, it's not my style.

441
00:34:08,109 --> 00:34:12,521
This ain't got nothin' to do with caveman,
alright, this is about trust, pure and simple.

442
00:34:12,522 --> 00:34:14,911
You don't trust her, you don't marry her.

443
00:34:14,911 --> 00:34:18,511
I'm sorry to sound so harsh, man,
but those are the rules of the game.

444
00:34:20,618 --> 00:34:22,818
I trust her. K?

445
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:25,498
Yeah.

446
00:34:26,686 --> 00:34:28,386
Talk to you later, alright?

447
00:34:37,253 --> 00:34:38,653
Have a seat.

448
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:44,946
I'll forego the blindfold.

449
00:34:48,097 --> 00:34:52,597
Miss Porter, as I'm sure you're aware,
the position of director of this museum

450
00:34:52,598 --> 00:34:56,025
involves more than merely
pulling collections out of hats.

451
00:34:56,065 --> 00:34:58,330
It involves image. It
involves relationships.

452
00:34:58,331 --> 00:35:00,843
Okay, you have to tell me
what you thought of my story.

453
00:35:01,781 --> 00:35:04,281
I'm so flattered that
you value my opinion.

454
00:35:04,282 --> 00:35:07,689
Nicolas, of course I value
your opinion, you're the most...

455
00:35:08,127 --> 00:35:09,327
brilliant...

456
00:35:09,725 --> 00:35:11,625
wonderfully smart...

457
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,790
editor that I've ever had.

458
00:35:14,084 --> 00:35:15,184
What do you think of the tie?

459
00:35:15,185 --> 00:35:16,882
I think it's fucking sleazy.

460
00:35:17,183 --> 00:35:18,302
Excellent.

461
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:22,818
Well, your story, if you
really want to know...

462
00:35:22,819 --> 00:35:23,893
I do.

463
00:35:23,894 --> 00:35:26,991
I thought was utter bullshit
from beginning to end.

464
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,119
I mean, beautifully written... you
always write exquisitely, but...

465
00:35:33,356 --> 00:35:34,756
swans?

466
00:35:35,569 --> 00:35:36,669
They mate for life.

467
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:39,890
Sure, and they have brains
the size of ping-pong balls.

468
00:35:40,229 --> 00:35:44,229
I mean, where's your edge, Jennifer?
Where's your nihilistic passion?

469
00:35:44,411 --> 00:35:47,311
Where's the girl that
masturbated in church?

470
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:47,879
Shhh.

471
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,751
I mean... "And he would've died for her, and
she would've died for him." What's that about?

472
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:57,056
It's about fucking commitment, you know.

473
00:35:57,134 --> 00:35:57,734
Really?

474
00:35:57,735 --> 00:35:58,234
Yes.

475
00:35:58,235 --> 00:36:01,515
Well, It reads like Spackle. Now,
I know you're marrying the coach,

476
00:36:01,516 --> 00:36:04,873
but if this is meant as a wedding
present, I'd keep it between you and him.

477
00:36:05,007 --> 00:36:07,807
Because you're more complex than this.

478
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:15,075
What did you think, just
then? Where did you go?

479
00:36:16,027 --> 00:36:17,427
Nowhere.

480
00:36:18,522 --> 00:36:19,807
You're obfuscating.

481
00:36:19,808 --> 00:36:21,008
Nothing.

482
00:36:22,332 --> 00:36:28,532
Listen, Jennifer. Commitment
is dreary. It's not your thing.

483
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:32,595
You have to... dig deeper.

484
00:36:34,345 --> 00:36:37,045
Tell me something interesting.

485
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:44,967
I've been doing these
really terrible things.

486
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,420
Where the hell is the director's office?!

487
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:55,199
This place is like a God-damned labyrinth.
Any moment I expect to run into the Minotaur!

488
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,844
Hi. Can I help you?

489
00:36:57,113 --> 00:37:00,913
Yes, well, you certainly look
like a very capable young man.

490
00:37:00,914 --> 00:37:06,152
Which is fortunate since I'm rather at your mercy.
I need to find Bette Porter or Xandra Rosenman.

491
00:37:06,153 --> 00:37:07,598
Well, they're both in a meeting.

492
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,971
In there? Oh, good. Take them for a moment,
would you please? Get them some more water.

493
00:37:12,172 --> 00:37:14,897
You can't go in there! That's a
board of director's meeting, ma'am!

494
00:37:15,171 --> 00:37:18,471
Get your hand off me if you want
to go on living and breathing.

495
00:37:21,494 --> 00:37:24,294
Peggy Peabody, what are you doing here?

496
00:37:24,295 --> 00:37:24,921
Peggy?

497
00:37:24,922 --> 00:37:30,138
Xandra. I got your call. What is this
about Franklin firing Bette Porter?

498
00:37:30,513 --> 00:37:36,613
Let me just say, Franklin... and anyone else
who may be involved in this little cabal...

499
00:37:36,727 --> 00:37:42,459
If you fire Bette Porter, I'll have to
reconsider lending my collection to the C.A.C.

500
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:46,360
Miss Porter is far and away the
most qualified person in Los Angeles

501
00:37:46,361 --> 00:37:49,075
to preside over an exhibit
like "Provocations".

502
00:37:49,076 --> 00:37:51,422
I thought "Provocations"
was going through MOCA?

503
00:37:51,423 --> 00:37:55,895
Well, it's not, Franklin, it's going
to your up and coming little museum!

504
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,850
But only on one condition.

505
00:37:58,472 --> 00:38:03,172
Ms. Porter. I'll need a guarantee from
you that you will remain with the C.A.C.

506
00:38:03,173 --> 00:38:06,790
at least until "Provocations" moves
on to the Walker in the summer.

507
00:38:06,802 --> 00:38:08,591
Well, I'm not in the position to -

508
00:38:08,592 --> 00:38:11,992
Miss Porter has 6 months
remaining on her contract, Peggy.

509
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:16,839
We have every intention of honoring it, despite
what you may have heard about being fired.

510
00:38:17,076 --> 00:38:19,476
Well, let's just forget about that, then.

511
00:38:19,698 --> 00:38:22,098
Do you have an option in the contract?

512
00:38:23,775 --> 00:38:26,375
Of course we do. Uh, 18 months, I believe.

513
00:38:26,376 --> 00:38:31,075
I suggest you exercise it here and now. By
the time "Provocations" debuts at the C.A.C.,

514
00:38:31,076 --> 00:38:34,379
Miss Porter will already have been
wooed by every museum in the country.

515
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:42,119
Wow. That's interesting. You've
fallen in love with a woman.

516
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,192
No, no, no, I don't know if it's love.

517
00:38:44,546 --> 00:38:51,646
It might be sort of like this, you know, fantastic,
sort of, like, demon possession sort of thing.

518
00:38:51,647 --> 00:38:54,169
Oh, stop it, don't look so shocked.

519
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:59,189
I'm not shocked. I'm surprised,
I'm excited... it's exotic.

520
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,646
Oh, shut up, you pervert.

521
00:39:00,647 --> 00:39:05,971
A demon possession. That's it, that's
what you have to take and run with

522
00:39:05,972 --> 00:39:09,058
and when you write
about... what's her name?

523
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,597
Marina.

524
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:15,298
When you write about Marina, you
must dig, you must delve, you must

525
00:39:15,299 --> 00:39:18,430
open up and eviscerate everything.

526
00:39:18,577 --> 00:39:23,177
You do your best work when you
lay bare your remarkable emotions.

527
00:39:53,693 --> 00:39:56,293
Coach. What a surprise.

528
00:39:56,914 --> 00:40:01,314
I'm looking for Jenny. And I just bet
you're going to tell me she's not here.

529
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:06,970
She's not here. We had dinner
downstairs, but she left 15 minutes ago.

530
00:40:07,681 --> 00:40:09,981
Come in and have a look,
I'll get you a drink.

531
00:40:09,982 --> 00:40:11,468
Absolutely.

532
00:40:27,488 --> 00:40:28,788
Bonjour.

533
00:40:29,296 --> 00:40:30,696
Bonjour.

534
00:40:31,678 --> 00:40:33,578
Do you have a minute for me?

535
00:40:34,821 --> 00:40:36,021
But of course.

536
00:40:36,022 --> 00:40:37,550
Tr×˜s bien.

537
00:40:38,411 --> 00:40:40,311
Do you see those two girls over there?

538
00:40:40,465 --> 00:40:43,565
Give them this and tell
them se la part se Marina.

539
00:40:44,348 --> 00:40:47,648
Well. Look at your beautiful dress.

540
00:40:50,337 --> 00:40:52,037
What can I get you?

541
00:40:53,012 --> 00:40:55,112
Let's cut the bullshit, Nick.

542
00:41:06,592 --> 00:41:07,592
Look.

543
00:41:08,409 --> 00:41:16,509
Jenny and I have a passionate relationship, but,
uh, currently it's purely intellectual. Okay?

544
00:41:20,901 --> 00:41:22,301
And coach?

545
00:41:23,175 --> 00:41:25,575
Congratulations.

546
00:41:45,987 --> 00:41:47,287
Oh-oh...

547
00:41:51,983 --> 00:41:52,983
Hey.

548
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,520
Uh...

549
00:41:57,749 --> 00:41:58,449
Oh!

550
00:41:58,504 --> 00:41:59,504
Oh!

551
00:42:00,981 --> 00:42:05,621
Um... there's no time for pleasantries,
because Tim is outside, by the bar, so...

552
00:42:05,622 --> 00:42:06,222
Fuck.

553
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:09,460
No, it's crowded, and he'll never
see you. C'mon. I'll cover you.

554
00:42:23,413 --> 00:42:25,413
You're welcome, by the way.

555
00:42:37,782 --> 00:42:43,482
Ahhh! Congratulations! Baby girl!

556
00:42:44,652 --> 00:42:45,652
Who all's here?

557
00:42:45,653 --> 00:42:47,858
Oh, the usual suspects.

558
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:53,809
Hey, um... what did David have to say?

559
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:56,365
Oh... nothing... nothing much.

560
00:42:56,792 --> 00:42:57,792
Kit.

561
00:43:10,609 --> 00:43:12,609
This is forms for a medical history.

562
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:14,656
Yeah, but he wrote something on it.

563
00:43:16,878 --> 00:43:18,978
He wrote you a letter on a post-it?

564
00:43:22,431 --> 00:43:24,031
"Dear Kit, I hope you are well.

565
00:43:24,032 --> 00:43:28,716
I need some family medical history for
my application to a residency program."

566
00:43:29,952 --> 00:43:33,500
"I've enclosed a self-addressed, stamped
envelope for you to send the forms.

567
00:43:33,501 --> 00:43:36,773
Grandfather tells me that
you are in a 12-step program

568
00:43:37,756 --> 00:43:41,656
and I want to offer you my
support in that endeavor.

569
00:43:41,996 --> 00:43:45,696
I wish you success with the positive changes you
are making in your life. Your son, David Waters."

570
00:43:45,697 --> 00:43:46,689
I'm sorry.

571
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:51,241
Hey, you know... I wasn't around
to teach him how to write a letter.

572
00:43:55,224 --> 00:43:56,224
You're here!

573
00:43:56,225 --> 00:43:57,856
Hey!

574
00:43:58,747 --> 00:43:59,347
C'mon...

575
00:43:59,348 --> 00:44:03,069
Okay, go on, go on, get out there.
I'll be out there in a minute.

576
00:44:11,338 --> 00:44:13,938
Brava! The conquering heroine!

577
00:44:16,974 --> 00:44:18,174
Thank you.

578
00:44:18,631 --> 00:44:19,831
Cheers.

579
00:44:21,587 --> 00:44:24,987
It's just one sip. I'm so happy for you.

580
00:44:24,988 --> 00:44:26,079
For us.

581
00:44:26,176 --> 00:44:27,476
For us.

582
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:37,430
I'm sitting in the
chair, writhing in agony.

583
00:44:37,431 --> 00:44:41,562
A demon, a minor demon, is pinning
me there, fucking with my head.

584
00:44:41,563 --> 00:44:46,861
Abraxas, he says, I'm Abraxas.
The demon of lies and deceit.

585
00:44:46,862 --> 00:44:48,062
So.

586
00:44:48,871 --> 00:44:51,571
What do you want to
know about lies, my dear?

587
00:44:52,428 --> 00:44:57,328
I'm not a liar. I try again to get
up, this time I'm flayed, splayed...

588
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:59,161
I feel myself screaming.

589
00:44:59,162 --> 00:45:01,063
I'll tell you about lies.

590
00:45:01,511 --> 00:45:06,811
There are white lies and black
lies... and many shades of Grey lies.

591
00:45:06,901 --> 00:45:09,101
But some lies are justified.

592
00:45:09,313 --> 00:45:11,913
Lies told out of kindness.

593
00:45:11,949 --> 00:45:13,849
Lies that preserve dignity.

594
00:45:13,913 --> 00:45:18,213
I haven't had a single bit of work
done. How old do you think I am?

595
00:45:18,288 --> 00:45:20,588
Lies that spare pain.

596
00:45:21,513 --> 00:45:22,813
35?

597
00:45:24,157 --> 00:45:25,757
Maybe 40?

598
00:45:30,522 --> 00:45:32,522
Everybody's a liar, dear.

599
00:45:34,162 --> 00:45:35,662
Look at that happening.

600
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:39,299
She's about to tell her lover
something patently untrue.

601
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,350
I just want you to know that

602
00:45:40,351 --> 00:45:44,018
whatever had happened tonight in that
board meeting, we would have been fine.

603
00:45:44,133 --> 00:45:45,633
Look at their gestures.

604
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:48,893
See how they touch each
other too intimately.

605
00:45:48,964 --> 00:45:51,864
How they avert their eyes
and cover their mouths.

606
00:45:52,193 --> 00:45:53,893
They lick their teeth.

607
00:45:54,037 --> 00:45:55,937
And hold their chins.

608
00:45:56,478 --> 00:45:59,478
They embellish their stories
with far too much detail.

609
00:45:59,479 --> 00:46:02,512
Anyway, I was shooting this story
with Truffaut and Anouk Aim×™e,

610
00:46:02,513 --> 00:46:08,245
and I had this big scene with her lover in the film,
and of course that day Anouk shows up on the set.

611
00:46:08,246 --> 00:46:11,786
But I don't care, because I know
exactly what I'm gonna do with the scene,

612
00:46:11,787 --> 00:46:16,346
and at the end of the scene, I have my big
closeup, and of course everything happens,

613
00:46:16,347 --> 00:46:22,324
my God, the emotion comes up, I chase it away, I
bring it back, it's rich, it's full, it's subtle.

614
00:46:22,325 --> 00:46:28,825
And at the end of the take, Truffaut turns to
Anouk and says, "Zat is ze way you should act."

615
00:46:30,048 --> 00:46:31,948
Can you imagine?

616
00:47:20,512 --> 00:47:21,812
Working?

617
00:47:22,258 --> 00:47:23,658
Yeah.

618
00:47:24,418 --> 00:47:27,618
Nick was such a pompous
ass. He ripped me to shreds.

619
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:29,262
I don't like the sound of that.

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,760
Bring in the pussy light!

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,760
You good?

5
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,880
And...

6
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,000
action

7
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,920
China, get started, there.

8
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,960
Amber, get into it.

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,960
Now, in walks the Principal.

10
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,520
You ready man, you got wood?

11
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,680
Okay. So, at first, first you're mad.

12
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,640
Get in there.

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,960
Girls, you're embarrased, and surprised.

14
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,120
Now you're hot.

15
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,840
China, blow him

16
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,800
Pop on her face, give
her a facial, and uh...

17
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,800
When he's done that, China?

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,720
Look up and say, "That was great."

19
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,880
"That was great."

20
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,840
"That was great."

21
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,040
Tina

22
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,800
Oh. It'll take time,
but we'll get through it.

23
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,560
Allright? We'll get through it.

24
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,040
C'mon.

25
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,120
I'm glad you came over. So...
I'll call you after class?

26
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,560
Okay. Have a good day.

27
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,520
- Bye
- Bye Tim

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,440
- Oh. Hi. Trish.
- Hi

29
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,440
Um. I'm just on my way
to the grocery store.

30
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,280
Um. To get some bread.

31
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,120
For toast.

32
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,840
I've, uh...  I've forgotten
my wallet and my keys.

33
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,520
So I'm just gonna go get
them. Where's my head?

34
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,280
And when does it start prepping?

35
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,880
Mm-hmm. Good.

36
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,480
So when do I have to go to Virginia?

37
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,880
It's exciting!

38
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,880
Allright! Allright. Thanks, Val.

39
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,720
You're going to Virginia.

40
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,560
As the personal for Drew Barrymore.

41
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,280
It's a huge fashion picture.

42
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,760
And my budget's gonna be three
times what it was on "Darkness."

43
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,280
That's wonderful.

44
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,960
But I wish you had discussed it
with me before making that decision.

45
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,800
I don't know what there is to discuss.

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,920
I got offered a job; I took it.

47
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,680
What about our summer holiday?

48
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,080
I was organizing the house in Hydra.

49
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,520
I never signed off on Hydra.

50
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,920
We talked about it, but I
didn't say "book a house."

51
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,200
Did you book a house?

52
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,880
I just want to spend time with you. You've
been here six weeks out of an entire year.

53
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,200
Don't you want to spend time together?

54
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,480
Come and be with me now.

55
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,480
C'mon.

56
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,600
Now, the fact is, I can't
afford not to do this job.

57
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,760
Do you have any idea how much you owe?

58
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,800
A lot.

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,160
Sweetheart... I want you to
have your beautiful dream.

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,160
Then I have to go to work, don't I.

61
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,920
To take care of you.

62
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,200
And while I'm gone...

63
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,960
you can resume your
little thing with Jenny.

64
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,840
I know you don't want
to be here with me now.

65
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,040
You want Jenny.

66
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,520
And he's rough, you know? It's like...
like... he fucks me. Y'know? It's hot.

67
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,280
- Yeah. That's... that's wicked hot.
- It is. It really is.

68
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:31,560
'Cause, 'cause there's not that, you know, bullshit of
like... you know, I do you, you do me, and, you know...

69
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,440
we check in, have we had
equal time? And all that crap.

70
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,400
You know, Al, just 'cause you're
riding the big fat weenie doesn't mean

71
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,520
there's something wrong with the
way the rest of us do it, okay?

72
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,440
Hey, look, now that you're out
big-time, let's give you a mullet.

73
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,120
- What? No.
- Yes, c'mon, hockey hair, it'll be hot.

74
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,240
- No
-  I don't think she's ready to be a bulldyke, Shane.

75
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,400
Thank you.

76
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,240
The thing is, though, you guys, I... you know...
I've only slept with him, what, like... five times?

77
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,640
- So, if I'm late
- -  You're late?

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,480
For my period? I'm sure you learned in 5th grade
that that's part of your reproductive cycle?

79
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,880
- Whoa, whoa. So, what are you saying, then?
-  I'm saying if I'm late, it wouldn't be Andrew's.

80
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,200
Well, would it be Lisa's?

81
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,480
Wow. Well, he'd be the first lesbo
in history ever to pull that one off.

82
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,280
Shit

83
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,280
Oh, so, according to the C.A.C., the
world that we live in is a godless one.

84
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,120
And art reflects that. It
mirrors the world we live in.

85
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,000
Do you think the fact that you're
homosexual makes you morally bankrupt?

86
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,400
I am a pervert. And only a
pervert could show this work.

87
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,120
I di
- I didn't know I was being taped. Anyway, that is not what I said.

88
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,000
She twisted it.

89
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,760
That's what they do. And you can be sure that this tape has been sent
to every conservative Congressman along with this lovely document.

90
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,600
A lifesized painting of the
president in an SS uniform.

91
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,680
Jesus sodomizing Mary.  And this is a
doozy, This is a live performance piece?

92
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,920
-  Are you sure this is art?
-  Absolutely.

93
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,120
We put it to a vote, Bert. It's an important
exhibition and the museum stands behind it.

94
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,000
Okay.You are gonna have to learn
how to deal with Fae Buckley.

95
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,880
She was caught off guard,
Bert. Could happen to anyone.

96
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,240
As your counsel I can tell you they
will try and get at you on legal grounds.

97
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,720
- Untranslated subtitle -

98
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,560
There's two ways to go. One: They rant and rave
while we look the other way. We do not engage.

99
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,840
That is what we've been doing. Sitting with our hands folded
in our laps while they call us pornographers and pedophiles.

100
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,520
The other strategy is to meet
them head-on. Duke it out.

101
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,160
I want to challenge
Fae Buckley to a debate.

102
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,960
The woman's a gladiator in the public arena.
She's brilliant. She pretty much always wins.

103
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,400
Let's do it.

104
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,520
- What am I gonna do if I'm fucking pregnant?
- Get an abortion, Al.

105
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,600
You could give the
baby to Bette and Tina.

106
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,200
Well, we're already like a family, it'd
be like the kid belongs to all of us.

107
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,240
SSo, instead of "Heather Has Two
Mommies," Heather has six mommies.

108
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,120
No, Bette and Tina would be the moms, but we'd
all be connected because of how it went down.

109
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,360
- Look, Dane, this is gonna be entirely natural, okay?
- Okay.

110
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,520
As long as it's not too,
like, crazy or anything.

111
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,880
Allright. Or too cool, I hear you. But think
about it, we'd be the kid's extended family.

112
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,480
That's a great idea, Shane.

113
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,280
Look, there's no bigger karmic lesson than doing something
entirely selfless for another person. I'm serious.

114
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,480
How about a little support for me?

115
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,200
Tina, Bette would've hired
somebody to do this for you.

116
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,120
And  I would do that for you.

117
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,600
I'm not gonna, uh...uh... come to your,
uh... show tonight. I'm sorry I can't.

118
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,960
Hey, it's okay.

119
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,640
I'm sure Bette will come.

120
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,200
Tina, I wouldn't want you to do
anything you're not up to doing. But...

121
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,680
don't you think it'd be
good for you to get out?

122
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,000
It's great. I look good, right?

123
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,160
- You look hot.
- You look excellent. Look at this.

124
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,000
I mean, from the neck, up. I mean, we really gotta do
something about your clothes.Gotta take her to Fred Segal.

125
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,960
I got these at Fred Segal.

126
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,520
Shane. Madame Cherie. Line 3.

127
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,680
She requires your
attention, immediatement.

128
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,120
Hello.

129
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,520
- Hi
- Hi

130
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,480
- Where are you taking me?
- It's a secret

131
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,800
Okay. Let's go!

132
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,400
Well?

133
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,720
Well... I don't know why we're here.

134
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,640
Steve and Harry own most of this
block. They're developing it.

135
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,320
And I've convinced Steve to invest
in you. So you can open your own shop.

136
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,760
- No - no
way! - Way!

137
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,440
But you can't tell him that
I brought you here, okay?

138
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,400
Isn't it just oozing with potential?

139
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,600
It's beautiful. I mean it's
un-fucking-believable...

140
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,400
I mean I think I'd keep
this like the old barbershop.

141
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,120
No big reception desk or anything,
just the cutting stations right here.

142
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,880
And this could be the waiting area where they've
sofas and tables. I see it: mid-century moderne.

143
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,040
Kind of kitschy but chic.

144
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,560
Hm. I'm thinking: pool table.

145
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,320
And up here, it could be
- it could be the coloring or the shampoo stations.

146
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,680
- Shane
-  Yeah?

147
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,880
Look at this.

148
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,600
- Ah, fuck.
- Yes, please.

149
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,760
I know I was only, uh... 12 weeks.

150
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,280
But I feel like I lost someone
I was with my whole life.

151
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,000
My baby boy.

152
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,920
Uh... just the last week we
found out it was gonna be a boy.

153
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:11,080
You'll try again. I know it's hard to think
about it right now. But you'll try again.

154
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,960
I know that Tina's devastated. Frankly, that's
the way she should be feeling.She's grieving...

155
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,200
what about you, Bette?

156
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,160
I see you steady and strong.

157
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,200
Letting Tina lean on you.

158
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,960
Has it sunk in for you, yet?

159
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,360
Have you cried?

160
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,280
Believe me, it's sunk in.

161
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,080
But, uh... Karen asked you a
specific question. Have you cried?

162
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,720
I don't need to cry.

163
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,440
I wanna see some episodes of "Insight."
Can you get me some tapes tomorrow morning?

164
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,240
hey! Tina. Tina

165
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:59,040
Now is the time. You know? When something terrible happens and
you feel yourself being sucked into that black pit of despair,

166
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,360
it's time to get outside yourself and force yourself to do
something for people who can't even tell you what despair is,

167
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,720
'cause that's all they've ever
known. I'll be there all day tomorrow.

168
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,560
-  What did he want?
- He wants me to volunteer.

169
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,440
Hm. Maybe you should check it
out, maybe it'd be good for you.

170
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,480
Yeah.

171
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,280
Do you think you're gonna be
able to make it to Kit's show?

172
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,360
Babe, I really don't want to.
I told Kit, she understands.

173
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,760
Excuse me. Excuse me, can I get -

174
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,880
This is so funny. I had group today.

175
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,160
Oh, you missed my ass? You guys have a whole session talking
about how you feel about me getting the hell out of there?

176
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:48,160
Well, we had quite a few other things to talk about, but
I have to admit that it's not... as intense without you.

177
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,600
What. Don't tell me this is the
last place you'd expect to see me?

178
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,440
-  I just never figured you to be a Kit Porter fan.
-  She's my sister.

179
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,440
Excuse me. Excuse me.

180
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,160
Hey, hey.  Meet my ex.  Bette
Porter, this is, uh, Candace Jewell.

181
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,400
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

182
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,960
Do you wanna sit with me at my table? It's
just me and a couple of my sister's friends.

183
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,880
-Hey, uh, where's, uh, Tina? By the way.
-She wasn't feeling well.

184
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,280
- Hey,
- Hey, baby sis.

185
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,360
This is Yolanda and
Candace. This is Slim Daddy.

186
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,200
Hi, nice to meet you.

187
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:32,960
And now... put your hands together , together
- together - together... for... Kit Porter!

188
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,480
Whoo! This, this is so cool. It's overwhelming. I
- I think I need a drink.

189
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:53,120
I was just kidding, baby sister! My baby sister is here
tonight, and she has helped me go down that straight and narrow

190
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:57,120
-In the house tonight is Slim Dad
-dy!

191
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,720
Thank you. Thank you. I don't know what I
- what I wanna say, but.. there's no one like this woman.

192
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,520
Kit Porter is a real motherfuckin'
diva. Ya'll go on, give it up for Kit.

193
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,560
- I respect that she's your woman
- She's not. You met my woman.

194
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:30,600
Oh, right, right. Well, I still
think the two of you would,

195
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,400
uh... you know? Yeah.
Lord have mercy on me.

196
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,000
Sing that song, Kit

197
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,320
I pass by the California Arts Center every
morning. I'm doing a job, right near there.

198
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,280
What kind of job?

199
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,080
My partner and I are doing the finish carpentry
on a loft in Venice we've been remodeling.

200
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,000
You're a carpenter?

201
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,160
You sure you don't wanna run
out with us tonight, baby sis?

202
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,840
We got everything for
everyone who needs anything.

203
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,680
Yeah, I'm sure. I've gotta get home.

204
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,440
Well, I guess I'll dream
about the ...two of you.

205
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,320
'Cause I got that basic
instinct about you.

206
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,480
Don't you get my
sister into any trouble.

207
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,880
I can handle it.

208
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,240
Oh, thank you. Goodnight.

209
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,920
I'm so proud of you.

210
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,560
- I should... really get home. It was nice running into you.
- Yeah.

211
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,480
Nice to meet you. You should come by and check
out the museum one day on your lunch break.

212
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,400
- Yeah...
-  'K

213
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,840
-  This is ridiculous.
-  No, I'll get it.

214
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,520
The food staffers are
so slow. They're useless.

215
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,320
- You shouldn't be doing that.
-Thank you. - It's their job.

216
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,280
- Well, they're busy and I'm helping them.
-  You're coddling them.

217
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,960
- We didn't order - did one of you order that? - It's
a gift from me. I want to be in Paris this morning.

218
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:10,800
And I wanna be in profits some day. It's
my treat. Enjoy. Put it on the books.

219
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,560
- Kate Moss, eat your heart out!
-  Look at you!

220
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,280
If I didn't know it was you, I'd have
thought someone hot just walked in!

221
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,320
Shut up! I feel stupid!

222
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,160
- You look so sexy, Dana.
- Really, you like the 'do?

223
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,960
You look great!

224
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,080
- What're you doing?
- Me?

225
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,520
- Yep
-I'm drinking coffee.

226
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,920
Oh, you can't do that. Bette and
Tina would kill you. Right Shane?

227
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,640
Bette and Tina would
kill her because she's...

228
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,200
Uh... oh, fuck. I'm sorry.
Alice might be pregnant.

229
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,160
"Might" being the word
I'm clinging on to.

230
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,040
And we just thought... we thought it was karmically
destined because Bette and Tina wanted a baby so badly.

231
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,000
- You mean, you would have a baby - -  And
Bette and Tina would adopt it. Right, Shane?

232
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,440
Well, yeah, but...

233
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,880
Ey, ey. Look, you can't say anything
because they don't know and...

234
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,480
Yeah. And you might be
misreading the karma or something.

235
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,920
- Oh, the karma.
-  Yeah.

236
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,360
- Do you know what an extraordinary gift that would
be? - Yeah. They're making super-sure I know that.

237
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,320
Not just to Bette and
Tina, but to all of us.

238
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:18,160
The whole DNA model of family is being reinvented. We're making a
new world that reflects the way we love and make relationships and -

239
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,080
I'd like to see that
reflected somewhere.

240
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,680
What?

241
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,480
Um... I'm gonna take care of this today.

242
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,320
- Oh, it's mine!
- Hey, no, no, no. I have a tab to pay, I'm paying it.

243
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,160
Um... I'm gonna go check out this
raw space with Steve Jaffe. He's...

244
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,000
-Yeah?
-Yeah, he's talking about opening up my own salon.

245
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,880
- No way!
- You gonna call it "Shane," Shane?

246
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,960
Yeah, I'm gonna go. You look great.

247
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,560
- Bye
- Hey. Thank you. Take care.

248
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,720
- See ya.
- Bye

249
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,680
Hey, there's a line at the counter.

250
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,360
Marina? There's a line.

251
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,120
There seems to be a
communication breakdown.

252
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,080
- Shane!
- Yah?

253
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,560
Hold up.Uh... I'll see
you guys later. I gotta go.

254
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,720
And thank you for all the croissants
and coffee and I couldn't drink.

255
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:13,600
-Aren't you late for something?
- Yes. Uh, wait for me! Thank you. Thank you.

256
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,280
- Bye. You look great.
- Thanks.

257
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,240
- Is there something you want to say?
- No

258
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,120
You pick a fight with me in front of these people?
And then you make like you're... you're hurt?

259
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,840
You're victimized? Do you want
someone to come to your rescue?

260
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,280
- Maybe.
-  Who, Marina?

261
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,360
I already rescued you. Remember?

262
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,360
C'mon, we'll take the Jag.

263
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,760
Hope you don't mind, we're gonna
drop my daughter on 3rd Street.

264
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,600
So she can kill a couple hundred of my hard-earned bucks on an
outfit that looks like it came from the Salvation Army reject bin.

265
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,440
- Oh, That's fine.
-  I was hoping you might hang out with Clea for a while.

266
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,280
- Just something.
- Well...

267
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,360
Well, you know what, Shane...

268
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,240
She quit college after
six months. She's flailing.

269
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,880
I thought maybe you could spend
a little time with her today.

270
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,720
She might open up to you.
Just an instinct I have.

271
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,040
-I don't know, Steve, it's -
-I would consider it a favor.

272
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,360
Oh
- yeah, absolutely.

273
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,320
Yes, no, I've checked that. I'm
checking it twice, right now, actually.

274
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,040
You told him that we're a non-profit
organization? That it's a tax write-off?

275
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,720
Well, then you should
let him know that we...

276
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,280
We're waiting for him.

277
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,920
We got a grant to hire a law firm.

278
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:51,360
So now, more than 50,000 L.A. garment industry
workers have health benefits for the first time, ever

279
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,320
That was our biggest project. Mostly, we -
we deal with very human-scale stuff. Y'know.

280
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,080
I forgot to tell you. Um... we also
have a Gay and Lesbian Alliance.

281
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,760
I don't know if that's
something you'd be interested in.

282
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,080
Um, I think I'd like to do
something, um... uh, with kids.

283
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,440
- Uh, underprivileged or abused children.
-  Okay.

284
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,160
Esai, here, is working with these
guys to bring down Clay Patterson

285
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,960
He's the televangelist whose refinery is giving
Cancer to hundreds of kids in the south L.A. 'hood

286
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,040
He's a bastard. He gets
around every court injunction.

287
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,760
Some Christian, huh?

288
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,960
Have you ever come across
a woman named Fae Buckley?

289
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,480
- Ben Coughlin just resigned from our board.
- You're kidding.

290
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:40,360
Yesterday in the mail, he got 62 individual letters with
his company credit card chopped in pieces from people

291
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,240
who don't want to buy office supplies
from a blaspheming pornographer.

292
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,040
Shall we get back to work?

293
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,720
Organs of dead animals decomposing?

294
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,760
A man strangling himself while
masturbating? You call that art, Miss Porter?

295
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,720
Those are inflammatory descriptions, Miss Buckley,
of but a few works of art in a much larger exhibition.

296
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,600
But she didn't answer the
question: What makes that art?

297
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,160
Excuse me.

298
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,040
I'm sorry, I have to take it. It's
Tina, she's... been having a rough time.

299
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,240
Baby, are you allright?

300
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,920
I'm with Oscar. Oscar Alvarez.

301
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,760
- Look, I'm right in the middle of - - You're not gonna
believe...  ... what he does here. You have to come by.

302
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,400
Hey. You're not gonna believe
what we found on Fae Buckley.

303
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,800
Is that what you've been
doing, Fae Buckley research?

304
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:32,080
Yeah. Did you know she was one of the main people responsible
for getting that teacher fired at the University of Missouri?

305
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,720
Yeah, they trumped up child porn charges based on
a picture of a 3-year-old playing naked on a beach.

306
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,720
I've been doing this all day, Tina.

307
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,680
I mean, I've got a highly-paid P.R. firm
working with me. My people aren't slouches.

308
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,520
Look, this is what Oscar
does. Okay? Just listen.

309
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,160
- Is there a problem?
- I thought this was supposed to be about Tina finding something of her own?

310
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,160
I thought this was supposed to be about
helping Tina get out of a bad depression.

311
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,920
Gotta look at this.

312
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,760
I think you and your people might
find this pretty interesting.

313
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,880
Hey. Clea will be right out. Now, I
want you to know, I will not forget this

314
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,840
Now, Cherie is planning this big
mother-daughter trip to Paris.

315
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,640
And you should hear her making all these arrangements.
Sounds Like she's planning the Camp David Summit.

316
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:34,720
Now Clea doesn't want to go.
See if you can't change her mind.

317
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,520
Have a good time, sweetheart

318
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,440
Look
- I know this is lame. But your father asked me to do this, okay?

319
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,880
Crap.

320
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,360
-  Allright.
-  Allright.

321
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,560
Allright, allright, allright.
This should be pretty easy.

322
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,320
Oh, shit! Fuck me! Sorry

323
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,520
Nice work

324
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,400
-Can I go one more?
- Yeah.

325
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,400
Man, I haven't played this game
since I was, like... seven years old.

326
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,320
- No?
- No

327
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,360
- I never did this as a kid.
-What, your parents never took you?

328
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,960
No, they weren't around.
I met my mom once.

329
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,880
- Wow, you didn't live with her?
- No

330
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,680
Can I, uh, can I... can I show
you something? Do you mind?

331
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,080
- Sure.
-  May I show you something?

332
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,560
- Um... before you hit the ball?
- Yeah.

333
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,440
-If you try bouncing a few times?
-Bounce?

334
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,600
- Yeah. Well...
-  Okay.

335
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,520
- You want to try it?
- Sure.

336
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,960
-  Okay. Ready?
- Yeah.

337
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,520
One, two, three...

338
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,960
- Oh well. Just about.
-  Nice - nice, though

339
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,760
Yeah, It was a great technique,
though. It was almost there.

340
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,760
-  Smartass.
-  Yeah, well...

341
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,320
Shut up.

342
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,480
"Here Cums the Principal"?
C-U-M-S. What is this?

343
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,960
Okay hang on, hang on a minute.

344
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,160
J
- Just, Jesus, just turn it off. I mean, really, what are you going to tell me? That Fae Buckley produces porno videos?

345
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:21,880
No, no, no. There, see that girl right there?
She's 17. She ran away from home when she was 14.

346
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,880
Apparently her father was abusing the hell out of
her,and her mother couldn't or wouldn't stop him.

347
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,360
Child services report we
pulled has all the gory details.

348
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:38,160
But her porn star name is China.
Her given name is Cora Buckley.

349
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:46,800
I know that they know I'm gay, I just really don't
want to talk about it with them. Oh, they're such pervs.

350
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,680
Well, why are they pervs?

351
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,480
Well, they have this cabinet that they
normally keep locked in the media room.

352
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,640
Anyway, one night they got drunk, and left some stuff out, and Consuela
was cleaning the next day and just happened to push play on the VCR,

353
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:10,680
and up pops my mom... buck naked, okay, riding my
day... whipping him with a switch.It was pretty gross.

354
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,040
You know, but you gotta... you gotta
give it to your folks, I mean...

355
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,400
they want to keep their life
interesting. And they... .

356
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,080
- they still want to get it on
- God.

357
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,920
You know. I've never met
anyone like you before.

358
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,720
Well that's
- that's not necessarily a very good thing.

359
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,520
Tell me more about your parents. Like,
how come you didn't live with them?

360
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,200
No
- No. No I...

361
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,320
- No I can't do that. It's not right.
- Why?

362
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,880
Because it's not what your dad had in
mind when he asked me to hang out with you

363
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,800
God, I don't care!

364
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,920
I'm
- I'm involved with a few things that I...

365
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,560
- I just, I don't wanna...
- Oh, like drugs? What?

366
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,240
Yeah, that's part of it.

367
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,960
- What if it's not true?
-  We got ahold of the police records.

368
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:18,320
And the missing persons report. We have evidence of Fae
paying off a district court judge to expunge the record.

369
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,880
Then why has it never come out?

370
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,280
Because our people don't
know how to play this game.

371
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:28,800
We're progressives and we're accused of being morally bankrupt. They
have so many fucking skeletons in their closets and we don't touch them.

372
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:36,080
We take the high road, we wind up in the ditch. We leave our dirty
laundry hanging out all over the place cause we're not so ashamed of it;

373
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:41,360
they grab it and wave it around. They make us look
like perverts! We have to get into their closets

374
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,040
We cannot afford to keep on being so
high-minded. Because we're getting killed.

375
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,040
- Hey
- Hi.

376
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:04,640
- Dana, right? Jenny. Are you alone?
- Yeah.

377
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,680
- Can I sit with you?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on. Here, sit.

378
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,480
-  I've never done this before.
- You've never been to a bar before?

379
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,320
No, a women's bar, by myself.

380
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,760
- Oh. Me neither.
- Oh, yeah?

381
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,080
Yeah. Well, Alice was supposed to come
with me, but her boyfriend called, so...

382
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,800
-  Alice is bisexual?
- Yeah

383
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,520
This is like something out of the
1950s. It's so butch and femme.

384
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,440
Mm-hmm, yeah. Well, it's the oldest lesbian bar in LA.
Actually, it probably hasn't changed since the 1950s.

385
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,520
But really, it's no different than
any other club, you know, I mean...

386
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,360
you have a few drinks... and you talk to a few
people you have nothing in common with, and...

387
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,840
realize how unlikely it is you'll ever
meet anyone who's right for you again.

388
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,080
So you have met someone
that's right for you?

389
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,560
We broke up.

390
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,840
- It's messy. I know that.
-  Oh, no, no, it's no problem.

391
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,600
-  Yeah.It's fine.
- It's small. There aren't, uh... too many places to sit.

392
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,320
Oh, sorry.

393
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,920
So... you're a tennis player?

394
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,840
What's that like?

395
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,200
-  I tr - I train a lot. -
Wow. That's really interesting.

396
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,440
-  I go on tour.
- Oh, wow.

397
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,640
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

398
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,840
I don't have anything to drink.

399
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,680
Do you want juice?

400
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,480
- Sure.
- Okay.

401
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,040
- So, this is where you write?
- Yeah, yeah. I, uh...

402
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:30,640
I pretty much, uh... do everything here. As you
can see. It used to be my, uh... writing studio...

403
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,400
- Um... but, you know, that thing with Tim and
I... -  Oh, oh, right, yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm.

404
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,600
So, he's letting me stay here so far.

405
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,120
And I pay him rent.

406
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,000
Which is kind of weird. Y'know. Hm.

407
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,560
- Oh,gosh
- Oh,shh... I'm so sorry.

408
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,840
- Oh, God. Just give them to me. I'll get them
dry-cleaned. - Oh, gosh. No. No. It's okay.

409
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,720
- I know there's worse stuff on it than that.
- Oh

410
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,920
- Ooofff. Damn.
- Oh, sorry. Did that hurt?

411
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,840
- No, that's alright.
- Um, you know, why don't, uh...

412
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,080
- What? Is this no good?
- Yeah, why don't you get up on top?

413
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,960
- Okay. Here. Here.
-  Ohh. Here. That's...

414
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:44,840
-  This is a... really bad idea. Isn't it?
-  It's really bad.

415
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:53,080
- Maybe we should stop. Before it gets too grim.
-  I think so.

416
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,960
- Maybe we should just be friends or something.
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

417
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,640
- I'll just grab this.
- Okay.

418
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,360
Oh, God. I am so PMS.

419
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,080
It's good to get off my feet, I
have so many functions this month.

420
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,000
- Steve and I are the Co-Chairs of the
"Have A Dream Gala". - It's good to see you.

421
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,320
I've been dying to get these chrome hearts
motorcycle boots. They would look amazing on you.

422
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,680
- Look, baby, I need to talk to you.
- I got you a present.

423
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:48,640
- No... I can't.
- Don't be ridiculous. Try it on.

424
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,800
I can't. Look Cherie, if I am going to
do business with you and your husband...

425
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,200
I'm not getting involved
in your marriage, I'm sorry.

426
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,040
You're not trying to
break up with me, are you?

427
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,360
Because that would be... a
very... very bad thing to do.

428
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:16,920
-  Do you like fucking me, Shane?
- I love it.

429
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,800
Steve will never find out.

430
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,240
- I'm not wearing any underwear.
-  I know. I can see that.

431
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,080
- You're crazy.
- You have no idea.

432
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,000
- Uh, does it lack...
- Okay, okay, does it lack... does it lack... oh,

433
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,800
- "does it lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value?"
- Good.

434
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,680
"Insight" is just down here on Stage 4.

435
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,560
Now what are you going to do when she baits you?
"So, Miss Porter, why are you such an angry lesbian?"

436
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,840
"Miss Buckley, why are you
such a lying, scheming bigot?"

437
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,200
Okay, sorry.

438
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:06,920
"Miss Buckley, I don't deny I am a lesbian, and it makes me
angry when people who haven't taken the time to see the work,

439
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:12,160
distort and misrepresent it to the
public and to the media." Is that better?

440
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,560
It's a... little
combative. But it's good.

441
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,360
Okay, wait. What else are we
forgetting? What else are we forgetting?

442
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:25,120
Okay, we did critical thinking, First Amendment, uh,
censorship in America... there's the Kurosawa quote.

443
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:31,760
- What is the Kurosawa quote? Okay, "Never avert your eyes -"
- Baby, you are so prepared. Just relax. Take a deep breath.

444
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,680
Okay? You're gonna be great.

445
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,360
Thank you so much for
being here with me.

446
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,040
I know how hard it is for you right now
just to get out of bed in the morning.

447
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,880
- I'm going to be okay.
- I know.

448
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,960
- Let's do this in front of Fae
Buckley. -  I'm there.  - Okay.

449
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,640
-  Tim, no!
- Come on.

450
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,680
I am going to get you with this.

451
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,120
Ahh! Be nice!

452
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,560
Come on.

453
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,600
- Jesus Christ, it was hard
enough to find - - Bette!

454
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,800
-  I am so glad to see you. I have really been looking forward to this.
- Yes, so have I.

455
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,400
-  Good, I see you've met.
- Bette Porter

456
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,880
- Welcome to the show. - Nice to have
you again. - Oh, I am so glad to be here.

457
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,160
Darla will be out in a few minutes to take
you both to make-up. I'll see you on set.

458
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,880
Hm. It must be hard for make-up people to find your color.
It's... so in between. I guess Darla will have to mix.

459
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,560
- What did she mean by that?
- She was letting you know that she knows personal details about you. She knows you are half black.

460
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:05,840
-Is that a crime now?
-She was trying to psyche you out. I can see that it worked. Look, Bette.

461
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,760
The Board is fine with it, I am fine
with it, if you want to use that video.

462
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,360
Fuck. Wait a second. I'll
be right back. Promise.

463
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:33,560
-  Hello?
-  Hi. Okay. Tim? We need to talk.

464
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,480
- Can't it wait?
-  No, no, no. It's can't wait.

465
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,240
Because you know what? Every minute that goes by, you're gonna get into
deeper and deeper trouble. You know you shouldn't be dating a student.

466
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,200
- Look, Jenny, it's none of your business.
- I know it's none of my business, okay?

467
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,960
what if Randy were to find out, Tim.

468
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,760
Tim?

469
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:58,520
Come on. Open the door. Come on.

470
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,160
-  If Randy were to what? Hm?
- Can you come in, please?

471
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,040
- Don't.
-  I'm not going to do this in front of her, okay?

472
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,040
- Jenny, you have no right. Stay out of my life.
- No

473
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,680
- What are you going to do, Jenny, huh? You gonna fucking report me?
- Fuck you.

474
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,600
You're obviously that
fucking treacherous.

475
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,400
I have with me, Bette Porter, the
Director of the California Arts Center,

476
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:34,960
the museum that is mounting the controversial exhibition, "Provocations";  and Fae Buckley of the
Coalition of Concerned Citizens, the group that is leading the efforts to shut down the exhibition.

477
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,320
She needs to loosen
up. She should smile.

478
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,200
Everytime something doesn't go
their way, they cry "fascism"

479
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,520
And I'm sorry this had to happen in front of you, but
if you really care about him, you're gonna back off.

480
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:56,920
Let me tell you something, Jenny. Nobody in their right minds would
believe for a second that you give a shit about what happens to me.

481
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,600
Are you in fact betraying
the public trust?

482
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:10,360
On the contrary, George. I am trusting the public. I mean
what gives me the right to decide what you can and can't see?

483
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:16,120
I am not more entitled than Miss Buckley is to decide
for you what is going to uplift and enlighten you.

484
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,320
Oh, there she goes again with
that liberal duck and parry.

485
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:26,680
It's just plain bad faith to promote an agenda the way this art show does
and then claim no responsibility for the immoral behavior it encourages.

486
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,840
Art is meant to be
perceived and interpreted.

487
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,520
It doesn't intrinsically
advocate behavior

488
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,880
How can you say you're
not advocating behavior?

489
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,240
Your whole purpose is to make that lifestyle appear
normal so that more people will want to try it

490
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,920
If I were trying... to convert people to my
lifestyle, as you seem to imply, Miss Buckley,

491
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,760
do you really think that I would do it by using images
of a man flaying himself and trussing his testicles?

492
00:40:53,720 --> 00:41:00,440
That piece makes me so... uncomfortable,I can barely look at it.
I don't think it is going to make anyone want to become a lesbian.

493
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,080
Where is the accountability?
Someone has got to...

494
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,280
-  I opened the '97 Brunello.
-  Is that the Caparzo or the Castelgiocondo?

495
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,320
Well, if it's too expensive,
I can always pawn my watch.

496
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,800
Don't be petulant, Marina. It's not how you want me to remember
you when I am deciding who to take to Antigua when I wrap.

497
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,720
... moral Americans aren't responsible enough to decide
for themselves whether to go to an art show that might...

498
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,080
What about that, Fae, are
you contradicting yourself?

499
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,200
Miss Porter's a very clever
woman, aren't you Miss Porter?

500
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:36,880
She thinks she is clever enough to trick the rest of us into believing that
filth isn't filth. Blasphemy isn't blasphemy. Pornography is not pornography.

501
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:46,360
But, this stuff speaks for itself... and however hard she tries
to defend it with her fancy language and her insulting logic,

502
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:54,920
all it is is sheer, disgusting, filthy,
ugly pornography. She is a pornographer.

503
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:07,400
I, uh...  I understand why... Miss Buckley
is so sickened by the porn industry, I do.

504
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:16,000
I mean, it's brutal, especially for the poor children......
and teenage girls who get lured in and... exploited.

505
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,040
All because they were
running away from something.

506
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,760
Those children lacked
love. They were abused.

507
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:27,320
And how awful it must be to come
from a home life so... desperate.

508
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:34,320
There is a world of difference between complex,
provocative art... and the tragedy of the porn industry.

509
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,200
May I ask what is in the box? Does
it somehow relate to our discussion?

510
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,120
- Do you believe in God, Bette?
-  I don't see what that -

511
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:44,880
Because if you did, this wouldn't be complex. You see God has
already done the work of sorting through all of this for us.

512
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,720
Faith makes seemingly complex
things simple and obvious.

513
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,720
- God is about the most - - The
Bible condemns homosexuality.

514
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:58,320
That¡¯s why God took your unborn
child from your lesbian lover.

515
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,120
And that was a blessing.
That baby is with Him now.

516
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:10,800
So he doesn't have to suffer the degradation he would have
been subject to had he been born into your depraved life.

517
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,760
Monster.

518
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,720
Monster.

519
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,120

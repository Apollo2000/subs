<i>Previously on</i>
Young Sheldon:

2
00:00:04,047 --> 00:00:08,927
- Well, we covered football, and grandkids.
- Maybe we've run out of stuff to talk about.

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,721
- We forgot about your ex-husband.
- Ha, ha!

4
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:13,598
The one you're dating.

5
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:16,226
Well, I know not to piss him off
during a hail storm.

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,270
Did he tell you I was naked
when he locked me out?

7
00:00:19,354 --> 00:00:23,107
What were you doing
naked with a golf club in a hail storm?

8
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:26,236
I know, it was the '70s.

9
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:28,696
I was just calling to let you know
I read your paper.

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,782
The masses for your neutrinos
are impossible.

11
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:34,994
I completely rewrote
the whole thing from scratch.

12
00:00:35,078 --> 00:00:37,664
I know credits are usually listed
alphabetically

13
00:00:37,747 --> 00:00:40,166
but I'm fine with my name going second.

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,669
I'm not putting your name on it
in any way.

15
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,753
Grant Linkletter.

16
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:47,882
Dr. Sturgis has stolen my work
and is using it in his own paper.

17
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:51,052
How dare you accuse me of plagiarism!

18
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:53,471
I don't want to see you
in my class anymore.

19
00:00:57,433 --> 00:00:58,851
I see, Dr. Sturgis.

20
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:03,481
Yes, that is unforgivable behavior.

21
00:01:03,565 --> 00:01:05,441
Okay, bye.

22
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:10,363
- Did he apologize?
- No, he is very upset with you.

23
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:11,531
Well, I'm upset with him.

24
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:13,116
That doesn't excuse you

25
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:16,160
from trying to get him in trouble
by calling Dr. Linkletter.

26
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:20,331
Who else was I supposed to tattle to?
I doubt his mother's still alive.

27
00:01:20,415 --> 00:01:25,128
Sheldon I understand why you're upset.
But you still owe him an apology.

28
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:27,046
Then you don't understand.

29
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:31,759
Well, for now, it sounds like
you two could use a little quiet time.

30
00:01:31,843 --> 00:01:34,762
Fine. I'll switch over
to Dr. Linkletter's class.

31
00:01:34,846 --> 00:01:37,682
He's a foot taller than Sturgis
and can reach more of the chalkboard.

32
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,350
What I meant was...

33
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:43,271
Maybe it's time to take a break
from your college classes.

34
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:45,732
What? Why? I've gotten straight A's.

35
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:48,735
I know you're smart enough for college.

36
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:51,321
I'm just not sure you're mature enough.

37
00:01:51,404 --> 00:01:54,574
Well it appears you've backed me
into a corner.

38
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:57,577
I would throw a tantrum right now
but that would just prove your point.

39
00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:00,288
Where are you going?

40
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:02,498
To play with my trains.

41
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:06,044
Which may sound immature,
but it's a hobby many old men enjoy.

<i>♪ Nobody else is stronger than I am ♪</i>

47
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:32,987
I'm the only cheerleader
you should be looking at.

48
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:35,782
Ahh... Uh. I was trying to find you.

49
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:38,409
- Just wanted to wish you a good game.
- Thank you.

50
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:40,620
- I'm gonna be cheering for you.
- Great.

51
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:42,747
Unless I catch you looking
at someone else.

52
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,707
- Then you'll regret it.
- No. Heh.

53
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,500
I'm not kidding.

54
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:49,837
Hi, George.

55
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,799
Oh, hey, Miss Hutchins.

56
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:54,884
I don't think I've seen you
at a game before.

57
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:59,514
Well, it's Friday, and I promised my
therapist I'd try one new thing a week.

58
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:01,641
And you picked football, good for you.

59
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:04,018
I don't suppose Sheldon's here.

60
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:07,355
No, he don't much care for outdoor sports.

61
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:08,856
Or sports.

62
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,233
Or the outdoors.

63
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:12,527
I was hoping I'd have someone to sit with.

64
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,570
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

65
00:03:14,654 --> 00:03:17,323
It was my fault
for letting myself feel hope.

66
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:20,660
You're welcome to watch
from the sidelines.

67
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:21,953
Thanks.

68
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:26,207
Watching life go by
from the sidelines is kind of my thing.

69
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,000
Hey, head's up!

70
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,132
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

71
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:35,717
I don't think so.

72
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,135
Call an ambulance.

73
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:38,218
Yes, all right.

74
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:40,179
Don't worry, we're gonna
get you taken care of.

75
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:44,100
If I die,
tell my therapist I hate him.

76
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:47,812
And who says you have to be mature
to go to college?

77
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,313
I've seen <i>Animal House.</i>

78
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:51,733
- You have?
- Well, I've seen the poster.

79
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:54,235
Those people are not college material.

80
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,321
Moonpie, I know you don't like
to hear this, but there are

81
00:03:57,405 --> 00:04:00,950
some things in life
that can only be learned in time.

82
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,119
So you must have learned them all, huh?

83
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:04,412
Get out of my house.

84
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,126
- Hang in there.
- I'm hanging.

85
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:13,421
Hey, this will be quite a story
to tell your grandkids.

86
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:16,758
I live alone, I'm single I don't think
grandkids are in the picture.

87
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:21,596
Oh, well. I got a wife and kids.
It's overrated.

88
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:25,850
And then my mother said
I wasn't mature enough for college.

89
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,185
Can you believe that?

90
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:30,354
- Absolutely.
- So, you're on their side too?

91
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:35,193
I'm Vietnamese. In my culture, until
your parents die, you're basically a baby.

92
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:38,780
- Really?
- My grandma still treats my dad like a child.

93
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:43,826
At dinner, he can't sit until she sits.
And he can't speak until he's spoken to.

94
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,747
- I'm glad I'm not Vietnamese.
- It's not as fun as I make it look.

95
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:52,877
Well, you can't bring her home
to an empty apartment.

96
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,047
Bring her here and we'll look after her
until she's back on her feet.

97
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,132
- Are you sure?
<i>- Of course.</i>

98
00:04:58,216 --> 00:04:59,634
We'll set her up in Georgie's room.

99
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:01,552
Thanks, Mary. See you in a bit.

100
00:05:01,636 --> 00:05:03,054
<i>Hey, George?</i>

101
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:06,140
It's real nice of you
taking care of her like this.

102
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:08,559
Well, it was kind of my fault.

103
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:10,520
Kind of? It was all your fault.

104
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:11,603
Bye.

105
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:14,315
Hey.

106
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:16,025
Hey. How'd we do?

107
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:18,027
- You didn't miss anything.
- That bad.

108
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,530
I can safely say you saw
the best hit of the night.

109
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:23,866
How's she doing?

110
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,536
Well, not bad.

111
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:28,329
Could be worse.

112
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,122
Little whiplash.

113
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:33,793
Couple of bruised ribs, broken arm,

114
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:35,670
and collar bone.

115
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:36,879
But that's it.

116
00:05:36,963 --> 00:05:39,632
Funny how you jumped
out of the way and let her get clobbered.

117
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,133
I did not jump out of the way.

118
00:05:41,217 --> 00:05:43,928
Oh, yeah you did. They got you on tape.

119
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:47,223
Okay, fine. But that was pure instinct.

120
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:50,852
Besides, she shouldn't
have been standing on the sideline.

121
00:05:50,935 --> 00:05:52,270
Why was she there?

122
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:55,064
I told her she could.

123
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,983
Oh, man. You must feel terrible.

124
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:58,234
Of course I do.

125
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,361
I mean, it's all on you.

126
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,364
- You done?
- Oh, baby.

127
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,074
I'm just getting started.

128
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,455
Oh, you poor dear. Come on in.

129
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:14,000
Thanks. I hope I'm not putting you out.

130
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,126
Of course not.

131
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:17,753
Hey, Sheldon.

132
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:21,048
Can you believe my mother
said I can't go to college?

133
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:29,390
So you just put her in my
room without consulting me?

134
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:33,686
- Consult you? Who cares what you think.
- Well, I ain't gonna sleep on the couch.

135
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:37,023
It's just for a few nights
until she can take care of herself.

136
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:38,858
Can I at least stay at Meemaws?

137
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:40,776
If you promise not to come back.

138
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,945
Why'd you gotta be so mean to me?

139
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:45,447
Just feels right.

140
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:50,578
And then after Dr. Sturgis
incorporated my math,

141
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,663
he refused to give me a co-author credit.

142
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:54,749
Sheldon she doesn't want to hear
about that.

143
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:56,125
It's okay.

144
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,794
So when your bones broke
did you hear it crunch?

145
00:06:58,878 --> 00:07:00,171
No.

146
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:02,381
Did my dad have to give
you mouth-to-mouth?

147
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:03,423
No.

148
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:05,384
I don't know how my mom kisses him.

149
00:07:08,054 --> 00:07:09,513
<i>Next up we have this...</i>

150
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:11,265
Who buys this crap?

151
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,644
Me after three beers.

152
00:07:14,727 --> 00:07:18,272
I mean, look at this damn thing.
What was I thinking.

153
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:23,027
Can I ask you a personal question?

154
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,570
You're not in my will.

155
00:07:24,654 --> 00:07:26,197
It's about my girlfriend.

156
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:28,908
- Uh-oh.
- Nothing bad.

157
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:31,661
It's just I've been seeing Jana
for a while now and

158
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:33,704
I like her fine.

159
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:36,874
But it feels like she's getting
more serious than I wanna be.

160
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,460
Georgie, until you're married,

161
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:42,296
you are not tied down to anybody.

162
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,298
You just go ahead
and do whatever you want.

163
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:46,300
Play the field, have some fun.

164
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:49,845
Interesting. That's what Dale said too.

165
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:52,722
Oh, did he?

166
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,599
Yeah.

167
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,687
- My boyfriend.
- Yeah.

168
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,817
If I don't go to college,
what am I supposed to do?

169
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,860
Spend all my days in high school?

170
00:08:04,944 --> 00:08:06,237
How sad is that?

171
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:08,698
Pretty sad.

172
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:10,282
You always did get me.

173
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:12,827
Sounds like you're feeling
misunderstood.

174
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:18,666
I am. By Dr. Sturgis, my mother,
and possibly the entire Vietnamese culture.

175
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:23,295
Do you understand that I'm in
a little bit of pain right now?

176
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:26,298
Oh, I'm sorry.
I should be exhibiting compassion.

177
00:08:26,382 --> 00:08:27,717
Aww.

178
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,968
Wait, I can do better.

179
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:30,052
Aww.

180
00:08:30,803 --> 00:08:31,761
Nailed it.

181
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:33,140
Time for your pain pill.

182
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:36,475
Be careful. You could become addicted
and lose your job.

183
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,978
- Which is all you have.
- Get out of here.

184
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,648
Thank you.

185
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:46,152
You comfortable? Get you anything else?

186
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,904
No, I'm okay.

187
00:08:48,988 --> 00:08:52,033
You've been so kind,
welcoming me into your home.

188
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:53,451
It's the least we could do.

189
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:57,455
It's so nice to be around
a family like this.

190
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:03,919
I've been alone for so long.

191
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:07,298
Honestly, if it weren't for the cats
I'd have no one.

192
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,592
Oh, wait. The cats.

193
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:11,552
I abandoned Edgar and Allan.

194
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,137
Edgar and Allan?

195
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,680
Poe ran away.

196
00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:17,349
Would you please go feed them
and tell them I love them?

197
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:21,062
Any chance this could wait
till the morning?

198
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:22,646
I guess.

199
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:26,275
Where are you off to?

200
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:27,401
Cats!

201
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,988
So you think he's seeing somebody else?

202
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:33,699
I don't think I should be talking
about this, he's my boss.

203
00:09:33,783 --> 00:09:35,993
Well he's my boyfriend so spill it.

204
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:39,872
It's weird when old people say boyfriend.

205
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:42,208
Fine, my lover.

206
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,710
- Well that's worse.
- Then talk!

207
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:48,255
The only woman I've really seen him
with is his ex-wife.

208
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:50,257
Oh, yeah but he hates her.

209
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:51,341
Don't seem like it.

210
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:54,470
What do you mean by that?

211
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,764
- They seem friendly.
- How friendly?

212
00:09:56,847 --> 00:10:00,351
- I don't know. He's nice to her.
- How nice?

213
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,686
Do you mind? I'm trying to watch this.

214
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

215
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:14,782
Son of a bitch!

216
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:17,535
Here Edgar or Allan!
Whichever the hell one you are!

217
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,453
They ever leave the store together?

218
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:21,330
Can I please just go to bed?

219
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,332
Just answer the damn question.

220
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,793
I feel like I'm gonna get fired for this.

221
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:29,839
Georgie, don't worry.
Anything you say is gonna stay right here.

222
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:31,632
But you lie all the time.

223
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:33,134
I learned to lie from you.

224
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:35,427
See what a special bond we have?

225
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:37,221
Now answer the damn question!

226
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:46,480
- Why were you gone for so long?
- I don't want to talk about it.

227
00:10:57,158 --> 00:10:59,243
- Whoa.
- What's that?

228
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,662
It's a ghost detector
that came in my cereal box.

229
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:05,916
It's just a piece of paper.

230
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,002
Then why did it move in my hand?

231
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:09,336
From perspiration.

232
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,546
Or ghosts.

233
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:13,507
Morning.

234
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:16,302
Did you check on Miss Hutchins?
Is she still alive?

235
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:19,013
'Course she is, why?

236
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,347
No reason.

237
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:22,141
I'm gonna go eat breakfast with her.

238
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:24,018
Sheldon, just let her rest.

239
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:26,145
It's okay, she enjoys my company.

240
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:28,981
Also, she understands
what I'm going through with Dr. Sturgis.

241
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,107
Excuse me,

242
00:11:30,191 --> 00:11:33,777
I am just trying to help you
grow up to be a functional adult.

243
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:36,655
Me? This one's looking for cereal ghosts.

244
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:38,240
Looking for and found them.

245
00:11:38,324 --> 00:11:40,910
I don't care. You are not ready for college.

246
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:43,579
If it were up to you
I'd still be in grade school.

247
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:48,042
If you think this is mature behavior,
it isn't!

248
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,673
Being a mom's hard, isn't it?

249
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:56,674
Sometimes.

250
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:00,679
If you ever wanna talk about it,
I'm here for you.

251
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:02,097
Oh, it's moving again.

252
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:04,642
You're so lucky.

253
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:08,646
You're gonna have to
walk me through that.

254
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:12,816
Well, you don't have anyone in your house
telling you can or can't do.

255
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,277
Right, Sheldon. I don't have anyone.

256
00:12:15,361 --> 00:12:16,820
I just said that.

257
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:18,864
Are you becoming a drug addict already?

258
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:20,074
Morning.

259
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:23,452
Got you some Shipley's
donuts and coffee.

260
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:26,538
- What happened to your face?
- Oh, uh...

261
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:28,707
Either Edgar or Allan.

262
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,417
Oh, that was Edgar.

263
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:32,253
He can be a rascal.

264
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,759
- Good morning.
- Morning.

265
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:42,221
- Did you sleep good?
- Yeah.

266
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:45,683
- Want some pancakes?
- Sure.

267
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,643
Just one more question about Dale.

268
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:48,769
Bye.

269
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:58,862
Here we go, nice little bite-sized pieces.

270
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:01,824
Thanks, George, but I think I can manage.

271
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:03,242
Oh, no, my pleasure.

272
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:06,078
He feels so guilty,
he'll do anything you ask him.

273
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,081
- That's enough.
- He bought me an Easy-Bake oven

274
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:09,915
when he closed
the car door on my thumb.

275
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:13,585
Unlike my mother who feels no guilt
after hurting her children.

276
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:16,463
How dare you.
I am trying to keep you safe

277
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,924
until such time as you can make
adult decisions.

278
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:20,008
I can make them now.

279
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:21,302
Hey, hey. We have a guest.

280
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:23,095
Let's pretend like we like each other.

281
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,848
Mary, do you grace thing.

282
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:31,979
- You okay with Mexican?
- Oh, yeah, terrific.

283
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:35,107
All right, now I got Tums
in the glove box for the ride home.

284
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,275
Great.

285
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:40,154
So you talk to June lately?

286
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,115
A couple days, why?

287
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:44,533
Oh, no reason.

288
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,869
I was just kind of thinking
of calling her myself.

289
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:49,079
I mean, if you're okay with that.

290
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:52,249
You wanna call my ex-wife,
go ahead and call her.

291
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,376
Well, I wouldn't want you
to feel uncomfortable.

292
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,879
- Yeah, you would.
- Yeah, I would.

293
00:13:58,047 --> 00:14:00,841
I think it's nice you all get along
as well as you do.

294
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:02,217
Mm-hm.

295
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:03,719
Where are we going with this?

296
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,180
Oh, nothing, just conversation.

297
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:07,264
Okay.

298
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:10,100
- You sleeping with her?
- Lord, no.

299
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:12,311
She's my ex-wife, come on.

300
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:16,315
Oh, my gosh. What kind of sicko
sleeps with their ex-wife?

301
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:19,193
Where is this coming from?
Are you jealous?

302
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:20,276
No.

303
00:14:21,487 --> 00:14:24,531
I just like to know
what kind of relationship we're in.

304
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:27,534
I mean, are we seeing
other people or what?

305
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,203
Connie Tucker.

306
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:32,247
Are you asking me to go steady?

307
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:34,750
You know what I'm asking, jackass.

308
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,587
All right, all right, you listen to me.
Now, I'm 72 years old.

309
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,424
You think I have enough stamina
to go playing around with other women?

310
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:44,551
You're saying the only reason
you're seeing me

311
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:47,096
is you're too old
and tired to see anybody else?

312
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:48,347
Give me the Tums.

313
00:14:57,648 --> 00:14:59,650
I could kiss you forever.

314
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,527
It's kind of a long time.

315
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,153
You got somewhere else to be?

316
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:06,949
No, it's just eventually
we're gonna get hungry.

317
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:10,160
Why do I keep getting the feeling
you're not into this?

318
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:12,204
Oh, I am into this.

319
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:14,622
But?

320
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,962
I mean, we're real young
and who knows what's going to happen.

321
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:22,047
I know! And you should too!

322
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:25,592
Well don't feel bad,
I don't know lots of stuff.

323
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:29,471
So as long as we're on the subject,
are you seeing anybody else?

324
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:31,014
No.

325
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:34,184
How about that nutty professor?

326
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:35,686
We're just friends.

327
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,897
Yeah, well.
That's what June and I are, just friends.

328
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,861
So, what are we?

329
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,531
I don't know, what do you want to call it?

330
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:50,909
I guess a...

331
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:55,122
committed relationship?

332
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:57,040
Works for me.

333
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,044
Okay. It's settled.

334
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:07,884
Connie?

335
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:11,472
This relationship is suffocating me.

336
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:16,685
What'd I say?

337
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,688
- I'm not enough for you.
- I didn't say that.

338
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:22,191
Just be honest.

339
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:23,775
You wanna date other girls.

340
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:25,986
I don't want to date other girls
instead of you.

341
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,822
Just in addition to you.

342
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:30,324
Drop dead.

343
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,212
Okay, but I'm gonna follow you,
make sure you get home safe.

344
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:45,172
Do whatever you want.

345
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,799
If you walk to Dairy Queen
I'll buy you a Blizzard.

346
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,720
Want me to turn on some music?

347
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:01,480
Well, this is just delicious, Mary.

348
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:02,689
Thank you.

349
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,275
Bite size enough for you?

350
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,027
Oh, perfect.

351
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,408
How long do I have to sit here and sulk
before someone asks me what's wrong?

352
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:15,827
Maybe people are tired
of hearing about it.

353
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:18,205
Miss Hutchins, would you care
to chime in?

354
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:22,125
Oh, I don't want to get in the middle
of a family issue, but...

355
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:26,088
I will say that I once had a falling out
with someone very close to me.

356
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:27,339
What happened?

357
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:30,217
We ended up parting ways on bad terms.

358
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,178
I still regret it.

359
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:35,097
But you were right and they were wrong?

360
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,306
You know what?

361
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,517
Doesn't feel like it matters anymore.

362
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,936
And not a day goes by
that I don't miss them.

363
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:46,942
Perhaps I do owe Dr. Sturgis an apology.

364
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,278
I was talking about your mother.

365
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,363
I'll circle back to her.

366
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:57,244
Thank you.
I can't believe you got through to him.

367
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:58,662
Happy to help.

368
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,081
So, who was the person
you had the fight with?

369
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,916
It was my cat, Poe.

370
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,586
She ran away when I switched to dry food.

371
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:08,589
It was cheaper.

372
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:15,721
- Goodnight, baby.
- Goodnight, Mama.

373
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:19,099
I'm really sorry, Mom.

374
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,102
I forgive you.

375
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:24,855
But just because you straightened
things out with Dr. Sturgis,

376
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,773
doesn't mean
you're going back to college.

377
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,859
- Yes, it does.
- No, it doesn't.

378
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:31,320
I hope you know
you're jeopardizing our relationship.

379
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,614
I will take that risk.

380
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:35,157
Goodnight.

381
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:38,452
You know I'll eventually wear you down.

382
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:42,080
We'll see. I'm pretty tough.

383
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,418
<i>I eventually wore her down.</i>

384
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:49,421
<i>There's just so much of me
anybody can take.</i>

385
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:54,676
<i>In local news,</i>

386
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,014
<i>Friday night's football game
was marred by a brutal injury.</i>

387
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:02,309
<i>When football coach,
George Cooper, saved himself</i>

388
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:06,271
<i>at the expense of beloved
school librarian, Cheryl Hutchins.</i>

389
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:07,355
Oh, no.

390
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:08,397
<i>We warn you,</i>

391
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,193
<i>the following footage is hard to watch.</i>

392
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:12,653
Then don't show it.

393
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:19,660
<i>Let's see it again in slow-motion.</i>

394
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,286
This is not news.

1
00:00:01,479 --> 00:00:04,134
Previously onYoung Sheldon... Who are you?

2
00:00:04,178 --> 00:00:06,876
I'm Paige. This is a very advanced class.

3
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:09,159
Do you know how to differentiate
under the integral sign?

4
00:00:09,183 --> 00:00:10,227
No.

5
00:00:10,271 --> 00:00:11,620
Do you know anything?

6
00:00:11,663 --> 00:00:13,491
I know you're in my spot.

7
00:00:13,535 --> 00:00:16,494
These are parents
we can actually relate to.

8
00:00:16,538 --> 00:00:18,279
Sounds good. Thank you, Lord,

9
00:00:18,322 --> 00:00:19,671
for connecting us
with the parents

10
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:21,282
of another special child.

11
00:00:22,587 --> 00:00:25,112
You kids are special, too.

12
00:00:25,155 --> 00:00:27,636
I used to work at the practice
with Barry, but I had to quit

13
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,551
once Paige's schedule
started to get busy.

14
00:00:29,594 --> 00:00:32,293
Well, a unique child can
require a lot of attention.

15
00:00:32,336 --> 00:00:34,208
Try all the attention.

16
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:36,297
Barry, it sounds like
you might be feeling left out.

17
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,733
Sometimes I do.

18
00:00:37,776 --> 00:00:40,040
Don't you get him another beer.

19
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,129
Come on. You love this,
and you know it.

20
00:00:42,172 --> 00:00:44,261
They're as messed-up as we are.

21
00:00:52,748 --> 00:00:55,490
From a young age,
I was the proud member

22
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:58,667
of several elite organizations

23
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,103
The Radio Shack Battery Club,

24
00:01:00,147 --> 00:01:02,758
entitling the bearer
to the incredible bargain

25
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:05,065
of one free battery per month.

26
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:07,023
It's no wonder
they went out of business.

27
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,765
Starfleet International,
entitling the bearer

28
00:01:09,808 --> 00:01:11,332
to say things like,
"I'm a member

29
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,073
of Starfleet International."

30
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:17,468
And best of all, the Natural
Science Museum of Texas,

31
00:01:17,512 --> 00:01:20,384
which included a free
subscription to their magazine.

32
00:01:20,428 --> 00:01:23,039
"The secrets
of carbon isotope dating."

33
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,997
Juicy.

34
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:28,479
Mom, can you make the salad?

35
00:01:28,523 --> 00:01:29,785
Sure.

36
00:01:29,828 --> 00:01:32,701
Hey, don't put in
any of those little tomatoes.

37
00:01:32,744 --> 00:01:35,051
Hey, I don't tell you how
to impersonate a lump of clay.

38
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,706
You don't tell me
how to make a salad.

39
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:39,969
There's going to be a lecture
on carbon dating

40
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:42,276
at the Natural Science Museum
on Saturday.

41
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,016
Who would like to take me?

42
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,931
You know what? I'd be happy to.

43
00:01:45,975 --> 00:01:48,238
What happened to helping me
at my yard sale?

44
00:01:48,282 --> 00:01:50,284
Ooh, is that this Saturday?

45
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:51,415
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:53,156
I'm taking him
to a lecture on...

47
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,462
what is it? Carbonation?

48
00:01:54,505 --> 00:01:56,203
Carbon dating.
A method of determining

49
00:01:56,246 --> 00:01:58,030
the age of artifacts
and fossils.

50
00:01:58,074 --> 00:02:01,121
Hey, we could use that to figure
out how old your grandma is.

51
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:02,731
That won't work.

52
00:02:02,774 --> 00:02:04,404
You can't carbon-date
something that's alive.

53
00:02:04,428 --> 00:02:08,389
Well, then, we'll just chop
her down and count the rings.

54
00:02:08,432 --> 00:02:11,914
George, did my "lump
of clay" remark strike a nerve?

55
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,830
A little.

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

57
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:42,118
Dad, do you believe that fossils
are millions of years old?

58
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,294
I guess. Why?

59
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:48,690
Well, Mom believes the world was
only created 6,000 years ago.

60
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:50,474
Yeah. So?

61
00:02:50,518 --> 00:02:53,738
Are these differences a
sticking point in your marriage?

62
00:02:53,782 --> 00:02:55,392
Not at all.

63
00:02:55,436 --> 00:02:57,481
Why? Simple.

64
00:02:57,525 --> 00:02:59,004
We never talk about it.

65
00:02:59,048 --> 00:03:02,225
So you just avoid discussing
topics you don't agree on?

66
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:04,184
At all costs.

67
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:07,230
Hearing that further convinces
me I'll never get married.

68
00:03:07,274 --> 00:03:09,014
Never say never.

69
00:03:09,058 --> 00:03:11,408
Why not? You just said it twice.

70
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:16,718
All right, as soon as I get
these tables set up on the lawn,

71
00:03:16,761 --> 00:03:18,894
y'all can start
bringing that stuff out.

72
00:03:18,937 --> 00:03:21,592
You think you're gonna get ten
bucks for this piece of junk?

73
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:24,421
Hey, that piece of junk
is a wedding gift

74
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:26,380
from my cheap-ass Cousin Betty.

75
00:03:26,423 --> 00:03:28,773
And I was gonna leave
a little room to haggle.

76
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:30,427
What's a haggle?

77
00:03:30,471 --> 00:03:32,516
Negotiating. You start high,

78
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,302
they offer less, then you meet
somewhere in the middle.

79
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:37,608
Leaves them feeling like,
you know, they got a deal.

80
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:40,307
Did they?
Not if you did it right.

81
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,091
How much are we getting paid
today?

82
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:44,876
You're not getting paid squat.
You're helping out your meemaw.

83
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,704
That doesn't seem fair.

84
00:03:46,748 --> 00:03:48,402
Yeah, we should get something.

85
00:03:48,445 --> 00:03:49,664
Fine.

86
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:51,318
How much you want?

87
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:52,536
Five dollars. Each.

88
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,494
Each.

89
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:55,974
That's pretty steep.

90
00:03:56,018 --> 00:03:57,802
How about I give you
a buck apiece?

91
00:03:59,326 --> 00:04:01,589
Let's meet in the middle...
Three dollars each.

92
00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:03,547
Now we're haggling.

93
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:05,332
Let me ask you a question.

94
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:06,594
If you break something today,

95
00:04:06,637 --> 00:04:08,944
are you prepared
to cover the cost of that?

96
00:04:08,987 --> 00:04:10,467
No. Nuh.

97
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:12,600
Well, we're gonna have
to factor that in.

98
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:14,471
And did you bring
your own lunch?

99
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:17,082
You said we were getting pizza.

100
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:19,084
Well, I did,
but pizza ain't free.

101
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:20,738
And I'm teaching you
about negotiating,

102
00:04:20,782 --> 00:04:23,393
which is a pretty valuable
life lesson, right?

103
00:04:23,437 --> 00:04:25,003
Yeah. I guess so.

104
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:27,005
So, if my math is right,

105
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:31,314
you owe me... two dollars each.

106
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:32,750
We owe you?

107
00:04:32,794 --> 00:04:35,100
The numbers don't lie.

108
00:04:36,406 --> 00:04:37,538
Dang it.

109
00:04:37,581 --> 00:04:39,453
All right, listen.

110
00:04:39,496 --> 00:04:41,542
I love ya, and you're family,

111
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:44,632
so if you do it for nothing,
we'll call it even.

112
00:04:44,675 --> 00:04:46,329
Take it, take it, take it.

113
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:48,636
You got yourself a deal.

114
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:51,291
Y'all drive a hard bargain.

115
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:54,990
Now start bringing
that crap outside.

116
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:06,828
My.

117
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:08,656
Yeah.

118
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,222
I bet he dresses down

119
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:12,486
to about 6,000, 7,000
pounds of USDA prime.

120
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:13,878
You would eat him?

121
00:05:13,922 --> 00:05:15,619
He'd eat me.

122
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:21,364
Wow. You're really
cleaning house.

123
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:22,974
Got to get rid of
the old gar-bage,

124
00:05:23,018 --> 00:05:24,846
make room for the new gar-bage.

125
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:26,543
This was Dad's.

126
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:29,416
You're not getting
rid of this, are you?

127
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:30,480
Didn't need it when he shot it,

128
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:31,461
didn't need it
when he stuffed it,

129
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:32,897
don't need it now. Really?

130
00:05:32,941 --> 00:05:35,030
It was his first
attempt at taxidermy.

131
00:05:35,073 --> 00:05:36,379
He was so proud.

132
00:05:36,423 --> 00:05:38,207
If it has sentimental
value to you,

133
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,991
I'll let you have it
for five dollars.

134
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:41,558
Ooh. For this nasty thing?

135
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:45,823
You're selling
his golf clubs, too?

136
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:47,869
Which one of your
children do you see

137
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:50,001
hanging out with Arnold
Palmer in the future?

138
00:05:50,045 --> 00:05:53,222
Dad's clothes,
his shoes, his pipes?

139
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:55,746
Honey, it's just stuff.

140
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,400
I know, but still...

141
00:05:57,444 --> 00:05:59,184
I get how you're feeling.

142
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:00,447
I do.

143
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,839
Now go away.

144
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:04,146
I got a lot of crap to sell.

145
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:10,065
All right, now,
don't wander off.

146
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:11,893
Pick you up right after
the lecture's over.

147
00:06:11,936 --> 00:06:13,242
Bye.

148
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:16,332
You gonna be okay by yourself?

149
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,117
I actually prefer it.

150
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:22,425
Yep. I'm leaving.

151
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:25,863
You keep saying that,
but then you don't do it.

152
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:28,126
Bye.

153
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:30,607
He's so needy.

154
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:32,174
Sheldon?

155
00:06:34,176 --> 00:06:35,133
Paige?

156
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:37,005
I'm so happy to see you.

157
00:06:37,048 --> 00:06:38,267
Are you happy to see me?

158
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,877
Not immediately.

159
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:41,270
That's okay.

160
00:06:41,313 --> 00:06:43,272
I'm happy enough for both of us.

161
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:50,061
Rice Stadium in Houston.
Dave Barnett and Dave Rowe.

162
00:06:50,105 --> 00:06:53,674
And Baylor's bidding to go up
14 to nothing.

163
00:06:53,717 --> 00:06:56,328
And if you're Rice right now,
and you're in that huddle...

164
00:06:56,372 --> 00:06:58,069
George?

165
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,289
Hi.

166
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:01,986
Paige's mom.

167
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,640
I know.

168
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:05,642
What a nice surprise.

169
00:07:05,686 --> 00:07:07,818
I just dropped Paige off
at the carbon-dating lecture.

170
00:07:07,862 --> 00:07:09,385
And I dropped Sheldon.

171
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,473
Well, how about that?

172
00:07:10,517 --> 00:07:12,475
How about it.

173
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,259
Mind if I join you?

174
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:17,175
Sure.

175
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,921
So, where's your... your hubby?

176
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:25,793
Barry? Barry. Yeah.

177
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:27,795
Who cares?

178
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:30,101
That doesn't sound good.

179
00:07:30,145 --> 00:07:33,061
Sorry. Just ignore me.

180
00:07:33,104 --> 00:07:35,063
Okay.

181
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:36,499
Hey, you want a wing?

182
00:07:36,543 --> 00:07:38,849
Yeah, no, thank you.

183
00:07:38,893 --> 00:07:41,286
You mind if I watch the game?

184
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,593
No, not at all. Enjoy.

185
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,336
I'll just see
what kind of pie they have.

186
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,430
Well, we were here
last year when Arkansas...

187
00:07:57,128 --> 00:08:00,305
It's getting a little tougher
to ignore you.

188
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:02,917
I'm sorry. It's just...

189
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,962
Forget it.

190
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:06,529
Okeydoke.

191
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:09,880
Fine, I'll tell you. Barry and I
haven't been in a good place

192
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:12,056
in a long time, and I...

193
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,755
I think we're headed
for divorce.

194
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:17,845
I'm sorry.

195
00:08:17,888 --> 00:08:19,716
I don't know what to say.

196
00:08:21,762 --> 00:08:23,981
You don't have to say anything.

197
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:25,940
That I can do.

198
00:08:25,983 --> 00:08:27,550
Ooh.

199
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:30,771
They have cobbler.

200
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:33,904
Rupert Taylor
got the block, and Charles...

201
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:35,689
All right, everybody, welcome.

202
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:38,169
Glad to see
we got so many people interested

203
00:08:38,213 --> 00:08:40,128
in radioactive decay.

204
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:41,564
Well, hello.

205
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:44,306
Hi. Hi.This is a nice surprise.

206
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:46,743
I don't usually see
young people at my lectures.

207
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:49,616
I enjoyed your paper on
accelerator mass spectrometry,

208
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:51,226
and wanted to find out more.

209
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:52,532
Is that so?

210
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,490
And you?

211
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,058
I read this magazine.

212
00:08:58,363 --> 00:09:00,540
It has puzzles, too.

213
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,020
Okay.

214
00:09:04,326 --> 00:09:05,980
Do you want to kick this off

215
00:09:06,023 --> 00:09:08,199
and tell us
exactly what carbon dating is?

216
00:09:08,243 --> 00:09:11,681
The 5,730-year half-life
of carbon 14

217
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:13,248
is used as a geochronometer.

218
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,163
Anything else you'd like to add?

219
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,297
Um...

220
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:23,171
carbon dating is how we figured
out how old my grandmother is.

221
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:29,438
It was at this moment I learned

222
00:09:29,481 --> 00:09:32,180
I was not only brilliant;
I was also hilarious.

223
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:45,976
I mean, you, of all people,
would understand.

224
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,065
You've got a special child
of your own.

225
00:09:48,109 --> 00:09:50,198
I do, I do.

226
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:52,983
How do you and Mary
handle the stress?

227
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:55,682
Well, we actually have
a pretty good system.

228
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:57,118
Please tell me.

229
00:09:57,161 --> 00:09:59,555
We don't talk about it.

230
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,122
Not at all?

231
00:10:01,165 --> 00:10:02,471
Zippo.

232
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:05,343
Boy, that doesn't sound
like it could work.

233
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:08,390
Suit yourself,
but I'm having a nice day;

234
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:11,567
You're crying
into your peach cobbler.

235
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,049
For now, let's neglect changes
in the isotopic

236
00:10:15,092 --> 00:10:17,704
ratio of the air
over thousands of years.

237
00:10:17,747 --> 00:10:20,794
This is pretty basic stuff.

238
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:22,796
Yes.

239
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:24,798
I'm bored.

240
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:26,800
Let's get out of here.

241
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:28,671
I can't. I told my dad

242
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:31,239
I'd stay here until
the end of the lecture.

243
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:34,590
Okay. Be a baby.

244
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,592
I'm leaving.

245
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,594
In our case, the math yields

246
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,859
approximately 48,000 years.

247
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:44,687
I was most certainly not a baby.

248
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:46,733
If anyone was a baby,
it was she,

249
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:48,058
because people
who call other people babies

250
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:49,692
are the real babies.

251
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:52,260
Wait up.

252
00:10:57,831 --> 00:10:59,223
I like it.

253
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:01,182
It likes you.

254
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:03,271
How much? Five dollars.

255
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:05,142
I only have 50 cents.

256
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:06,883
That's okay. We're haggling.

257
00:11:06,927 --> 00:11:09,146
I don't know what that means.

258
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,453
You make me an offer, and
we meet in the middle.

259
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:13,498
The middle of what?

260
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:16,676
I'm not really sure.

261
00:11:27,295 --> 00:11:29,166
What are you doing?

262
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:32,126
Considering buying this jacket.

263
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:35,912
I found chewing tobacco
and Juicy Fruit in the pocket.

264
00:11:35,956 --> 00:11:38,436
Does that come with it,
or is it extra?

265
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:41,526
Actually, that's not for sale.

266
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,311
Why don't you look
for something else.

267
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:45,269
You sure?
There's a price tag on it.

268
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:47,228
Just take it off.

269
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:49,752
Is this some kind of
bargaining technique?

270
00:11:49,796 --> 00:11:51,449
Because I should warn you.

271
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:53,625
I've been to the
bazaars in Istanbul,

272
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:58,805
where the negotiations are fast,
furious and bilingual.

273
00:11:58,848 --> 00:12:00,415
Just take it off, damn it.

274
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:06,203
What just happened?

275
00:12:07,248 --> 00:12:09,032
That's my dad's jacket.

276
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,298
Still don't know what happened.

277
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:19,129
Do you think humans will become
extinct like the dinosaurs?

278
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:21,958
Yes, but before that happens,
some of us will merge

279
00:12:22,002 --> 00:12:23,960
with computers and
become immortal cyborgs.

280
00:12:24,004 --> 00:12:25,962
That's a fascinating idea.

281
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:27,181
Thank you.

282
00:12:27,224 --> 00:12:29,836
Did you get that from a TV show?

283
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,185
No.

284
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:34,405
A comic book.

285
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:39,410
And then when Paige turned six,
it was obvious

286
00:12:39,454 --> 00:12:40,716
she wasn't like the other kids,

287
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,560
and she needed a school
where she could excel.

288
00:12:42,587 --> 00:12:44,807
But Barry's dental practice

289
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:46,809
was 50 miles
outside of Fayetteville,

290
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:49,333
and do you know what's available
for extraordinary children

291
00:12:49,377 --> 00:12:51,771
50 miles outside
of Fayetteville?

292
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:53,294
I'm gonna guess not much.Nothing.

293
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:56,664
So I packed us up, and I made
him move to Texas where,

294
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:59,517
believe it or not,
people do get cavities.

295
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:01,824
I believe it.
I had a humdinger last summer.

296
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:04,131
Face swelled up
like a cantaloupe. And do you know

297
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:06,176
he's been cool to me ever since,

298
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,309
even though
his practice is making money

299
00:13:08,352 --> 00:13:09,789
hand over fist. Yeah, yeah.

300
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:11,312
A flag down...

301
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:12,835
And as much as he
says I ignore him,

302
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:14,619
he ignores me just as much.

303
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:16,467
I mean, would it kill him
to get a babysitter every once

304
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:18,710
in a while and take me
to dinner, maybe a movie?

305
00:13:18,754 --> 00:13:19,711
It would not.

306
00:13:19,755 --> 00:13:22,062
Darn. You didn't see me.

307
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:26,283
Then you've got fourth down,
and he throws the...

308
00:13:26,327 --> 00:13:28,459
George!

309
00:13:30,374 --> 00:13:32,333
Hey.

310
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:33,682
Paige's dad.

311
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:36,554
Barry. Yeah, of course,
I remember.

312
00:13:36,598 --> 00:13:38,078
What are you doing here?

313
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:39,340
Just, you know,

314
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:41,168
Sheldon wanted to go
to a science lecture.

315
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:42,560
No kidding.

316
00:13:42,604 --> 00:13:43,953
We just dropped Paige off there.

317
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:45,955
You don't say.

318
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:47,565
Ooh.

319
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:49,176
Caveman stuff. I love that.

320
00:13:49,219 --> 00:13:51,352
Where are you going?
It's closed.

321
00:13:51,395 --> 00:13:54,921
I can read... baby.

322
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:59,447
Just so you know,
that won't work every time.

323
00:14:01,144 --> 00:14:03,059
You haven't,
seen Linda around, have you?

324
00:14:03,103 --> 00:14:04,495
Linda.

325
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:07,237
Your wife, Linda.

326
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:09,109
Yeah. No.

327
00:14:09,152 --> 00:14:10,806
So what's new?

328
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,286
Not much.

329
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:13,287
Hey, you like football?

330
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,854
No.

331
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,725
Well, you sure?
It's a close game.

332
00:14:16,768 --> 00:14:20,468
No, no, I'm,
more of a tennis man.

333
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:24,515
Well, those are two very
different sports, aren't they?

334
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:26,256
I think you've got to go outside

335
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,128
and rely on somebody like...

336
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:32,393
George... can I confide in you?

337
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:53,980
This is oddly reminiscent
of a dinner with my family.

338
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:55,024
You're funny.

339
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:56,417
I know.

340
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,593
My family never
eats dinner together.

341
00:14:58,636 --> 00:15:00,334
Why not?

342
00:15:00,377 --> 00:15:03,511
My dad always manages to come
home from work after we're done.

343
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:07,254
My dad never misses a meal.

344
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:10,561
Do you think Stone Age parents
stayed together forever?

345
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:12,912
They had to.
There were no lawyers.

346
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:14,000
What?

347
00:15:14,043 --> 00:15:15,566
That was funny.

348
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,047
Right, we've
established I'm funny.

349
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:20,397
Well, I think my parents
are getting a divorce.

350
00:15:20,441 --> 00:15:21,833
Why?

351
00:15:21,877 --> 00:15:23,009
They fight all the time.

352
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:25,272
About what? Mostly me.

353
00:15:26,316 --> 00:15:28,144
That's too bad.

354
00:15:28,188 --> 00:15:30,146
I guess I'm lucky.

355
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,408
Why?

356
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:34,455
I'm the glue that holds
our family together.

357
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,501
What are you kids
doing in there?

358
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:43,638
Okay, ten cents a week
for a whole year.

359
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:47,163
I get the raccoon, and to tell
people you're my girlfriend.

360
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:50,036
15 cents a week, and if you
say hello to me in school,

361
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,559
I'll say hello back.

362
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:53,604
Deal.

363
00:15:55,128 --> 00:15:58,958
Connie, I need to apologize.

364
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,438
That's okay.
Don't worry about it.

365
00:16:01,482 --> 00:16:03,527
No, I am worrying about it.

366
00:16:03,571 --> 00:16:07,096
I didn't realize that with you
and I being in a relationship,

367
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,185
me wearing
your dead husband's clothes

368
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:12,536
would be emotionally
challenging for you.

369
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,235
All right, apology accepted.

370
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:16,671
Thank you.

371
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:22,546
Are you okay?

372
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:29,989
I guess I just didn't expect
that getting rid of my...

373
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:33,731
my husband's stuff
was gonna hit me so hard.

374
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:39,172
He must have been
a wonderful man.

375
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:42,610
Well, he had his moments.

376
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:47,006
He was married to a wonderful
woman, so that says a lot.

377
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,183
You're pretty
wonderful yourself.

378
00:16:51,271 --> 00:16:53,316
Thank you.

379
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,625
Now, let's talk
about this hula girl lamp.

380
00:16:57,668 --> 00:16:59,844
What's your best price?

381
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:02,064
It's my gift to you.

382
00:17:02,108 --> 00:17:03,413
Nice haggle.

383
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:05,807
Nice mullet.

384
00:17:06,851 --> 00:17:08,288
Thanks again.

385
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:10,899
Real sorry about this.

386
00:17:10,942 --> 00:17:12,901
What were you thinking?

387
00:17:12,944 --> 00:17:14,120
I got bored.

388
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:15,164
'Cause you're a baby.

389
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,209
What happened?

390
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:17,645
Everything's fine.

391
00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:19,255
They just wandered off.

392
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:21,214
Hey, Linda, nice to see you.

393
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:23,868
George, Sheldon's dad.

394
00:17:23,912 --> 00:17:26,088
Sure, yes. Hi.

395
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:29,570
Well, good to see you folks.

396
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:31,267
Take care.

397
00:17:33,704 --> 00:17:37,186
Did you know that her parents
are getting a divorce?

398
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,362
Just keep walking. Keep walking.

399
00:17:44,324 --> 00:17:46,804
What... what is that for?

400
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:48,676
Well, can't I
appreciate my wife?

401
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:50,678
What did you do now?

402
00:17:50,721 --> 00:17:51,940
I didn't do anything.

403
00:17:51,983 --> 00:17:53,985
Want to hear something cool?

404
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:56,292
Sheldon skipped out
of that lecture

405
00:17:56,336 --> 00:17:59,339
with that little Paige girl,
snuck into a closed exhibit.

406
00:17:59,382 --> 00:18:01,384
You're kidding.True.

407
00:18:01,428 --> 00:18:04,909
Even got, "arrested"
by the museum security cops.

408
00:18:04,953 --> 00:18:06,737
Why would you think that's cool?

409
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:08,739
Sheldon got into trouble
with a girl!

410
00:18:08,783 --> 00:18:10,828
I'm bursting with pride.

411
00:18:12,221 --> 00:18:14,963
You know what? I don't
want to talk about it.

412
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:17,705
There, right there.

413
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:19,750
That's why I love you.

414
00:18:30,848 --> 00:18:32,459
You gonna eat your beans?

415
00:18:32,502 --> 00:18:34,722
Yeah, I'm gonna
eat my beans. Duh.

416
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:35,897
What about your tots?

417
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,551
Those, too. Georgie!

418
00:18:37,594 --> 00:18:38,682
Just eat your own dinner.

419
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:39,988
Dad?

420
00:18:40,031 --> 00:18:41,381
Can't have my tots, either!

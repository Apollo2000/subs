2
00:00:01,905 --> 00:00:03,821
So, he's really good

3
00:00:03,906 --> 00:00:05,406
- to graduate?
- He sure is.

4
00:00:05,498 --> 00:00:07,195
Do you think I can make it
from one end

5
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,632
of the college campus
to the other

6
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,929
in under ten minutes,
including a bathroom break?

7
00:00:11,049 --> 00:00:12,547
How important
is the bathroom break?

8
00:00:12,632 --> 00:00:14,657
Very. The class schedules
are designed

9
00:00:14,742 --> 00:00:16,945
for fully grown bladders,
and mine is child-sized.

10
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:18,382
One other bit of business.

11
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,390
Since you're graduating
top of the class,

12
00:00:20,523 --> 00:00:22,187
that makes you
our valedictorian.

13
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,364
I'm so proud of you,
baby.

14
00:00:24,505 --> 00:00:25,684
You seem surprised.

15
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:27,910
Well, it's quite
an accomplishment.

16
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:30,078
In this school?
I don't think so.

17
00:00:31,355 --> 00:00:33,093
We're really gonna
miss you.

18
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:38,078
<i>I've always enjoyed
math word problems.</i>

19
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,438
<i>Try wrapping your noggin
around this one.</i>

20
00:00:40,523 --> 00:00:42,703
<i>A brilliant young boy
named Sheldon</i>

21
00:00:42,788 --> 00:00:44,046
<i>is about to start college.</i>

22
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:46,282
<i>He needs to get
from his linear algebra class</i>

23
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:49,477
<i>to his physics class,
which is 822 meters away.</i>

24
00:00:49,562 --> 00:00:53,486
<i>If his stride is 23 inches long
and he only has</i>

25
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,774
<i>ten minutes, how many steps
would he have to take per minute</i>

26
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:59,453
<i>to make it on time?
It's a doozy, isn't it?</i>

27
00:00:59,773 --> 00:01:01,039
<i>Don't worry.</i>

28
00:01:01,147 --> 00:01:02,543
<i>I'll show my work.</i>

29
00:01:02,752 --> 00:01:06,211
<i>First, we must determine
the maximum velocity achievable</i>

30
00:01:06,296 --> 00:01:08,171
<i>without breaking a sweat.</i>

31
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:09,945
<i>Sweating is for jocks</i>

32
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,312
<i>and those who are worried
the jig is up.</i>

33
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,601
Hi, Sheldon.

34
00:01:21,685 --> 00:01:23,836
Not now, Billy. I'm in the
middle of a math problem.

35
00:01:23,921 --> 00:01:25,123
Okay.

36
00:01:28,893 --> 00:01:30,226
Darn it.

37
00:01:32,132 --> 00:01:33,561
What are you looking for?

38
00:01:33,646 --> 00:01:34,868
Chest hairs.

39
00:01:34,953 --> 00:01:36,469
Is there any chance
I'll hit puberty

40
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:37,672
in the next few weeks?

41
00:01:37,757 --> 00:01:39,890
Oh, God,
I hope not. Why?

42
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:41,548
The campus is so big,
I'll never make it

43
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,711
from one class
to another

44
00:01:42,804 --> 00:01:44,773
without a solid dose
of testosterone.

45
00:01:44,975 --> 00:01:47,662
Maybe they'll let you
leave early so you'll have time.

46
00:01:47,747 --> 00:01:48,866
But the end of the class is

47
00:01:48,951 --> 00:01:50,455
when I point out
the teacher's mistakes.

48
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:52,131
Everybody loves that.

49
00:01:52,542 --> 00:01:54,194
I'd say
run across campus,

50
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:55,834
but I know how you feel
about sweating.

51
00:01:55,937 --> 00:01:57,607
It's the urine
of the skin.

52
00:01:58,504 --> 00:01:59,770
Why not ride your bike?

53
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:01,859
I considered that,
but I can't let my colleagues

54
00:02:01,982 --> 00:02:04,633
see me with training wheels.
They'll think I'm a child.

55
00:02:04,777 --> 00:02:06,764
Can't have that.
Mm-mm.

56
00:02:09,298 --> 00:02:10,824
See any fuzz growing?

57
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,255
Let me look.

58
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,649
Hey.

59
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:15,852
No, Meemaw! Bad Meemaw.

60
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:18,149
What do you want?

61
00:02:18,234 --> 00:02:20,441
I was hoping you could help me
build up my leg muscles

62
00:02:20,526 --> 00:02:21,922
to increase my speed.

63
00:02:22,006 --> 00:02:24,229
If you don't want people
chasing you, be less annoying.

64
00:02:24,313 --> 00:02:26,622
It's so I can get
to my classes on time.

65
00:02:26,805 --> 00:02:29,117
Sheldon, you know
you ain't gonna work out.

66
00:02:29,202 --> 00:02:30,946
I will. This is important.

67
00:02:31,244 --> 00:02:32,774
Fine.

68
00:02:32,859 --> 00:02:34,555
Here. Hold these.

69
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:36,422
Now, keep your back
straight

70
00:02:36,508 --> 00:02:38,319
and bend your knees
like this.

Dad, you're a football coach.

73
00:02:58,173 --> 00:02:59,830
Do you use
human growth hormone

74
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:01,961
to enhance the performance
of your players?

75
00:03:02,046 --> 00:03:05,305
We lost our last game
63 to nine. What do you think?

76
00:03:05,397 --> 00:03:07,750
I think you should
look into human growth hormone.

77
00:03:08,078 --> 00:03:10,405
And if you do,
send some this kid's way.

78
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:13,016
<i>With no access
to controlled substances,</i>

79
00:03:13,101 --> 00:03:14,704
<i>I was left with only one option.</i>

80
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:17,250
Missy, will you teach me
to ride a bike tomorrow?

81
00:03:17,335 --> 00:03:18,948
- Why not Mom?
- Working.

82
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,501
- Meemaw?
- Old.

83
00:03:20,586 --> 00:03:22,117
- Dad?
- Fat.

84
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,485
Okay.

85
00:03:26,313 --> 00:03:28,074
I'm such a good person.

86
00:03:28,203 --> 00:03:30,048
All right.
You're gonna pedal.

87
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:31,557
I'm gonna run behind
and hold you up.

88
00:03:31,641 --> 00:03:32,776
I'm nervous.

89
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,386
Just pedal. You'll be fine.

90
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,735
Ready?

91
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,617
- Not really.
- Go.

92
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,666
I'm doing it.

93
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:41,434
- Okay, I'm gonna let go.
- Don't let go.

94
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,743
- I'm letting go.
- Don't let go.

95
00:03:42,827 --> 00:03:44,336
- I already let go.
- You let go?

96
00:03:44,421 --> 00:03:45,643
I let go.

97
00:03:45,728 --> 00:03:47,071
I'm doing it.

98
00:03:47,296 --> 00:03:49,214

- Dad, Sheldon got hurt.
- How?

107
00:04:15,301 --> 00:04:17,082
A chicken chased him
into a mailbox.

108
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:18,919
Course it did.

109
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:23,701
If I knew you could run, I
would've let you teach him.

110
00:04:23,786 --> 00:04:25,226
What happened?

111
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,802
Belinda got off her leash.

112
00:04:26,887 --> 00:04:28,044
You okay?

113
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:30,091
My arm really hurts.
I want Mom.

114
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,349
You got me.
Now, let me take a look.

115
00:04:32,434 --> 00:04:34,442
Don't touch it.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

116
00:04:34,527 --> 00:04:36,663
I'm sorry, but you are too big
to be delicate.

117
00:04:36,748 --> 00:04:37,716
I'm delicate.

118
00:04:37,801 --> 00:04:39,614
Just want to see
if you can bend it.

119
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:41,486
I can't.
It hurts too much.

120
00:04:42,223 --> 00:04:44,607
I'm gonna take him
to the emergency room.

121
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,286
Come on.

122
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:48,330
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

123
00:04:49,816 --> 00:04:51,661
Have fun!

124
00:04:53,974 --> 00:04:55,293
This is bad.

125
00:04:55,377 --> 00:04:56,661
You're gonna be just fine.

126
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:58,427
This is the arm
I write with.

127
00:04:58,512 --> 00:05:00,067
This is the arm I eat with.

128
00:05:00,152 --> 00:05:01,919
This is the arm
I do the Vulcan salute with.

129
00:05:02,004 --> 00:05:03,226
Ow.

130
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:04,924
It's not too swollen.
That's a good sign.

131
00:05:05,024 --> 00:05:06,289
You're not a doctor.

132
00:05:06,457 --> 00:05:08,593
But I see this on
the football field all the time.

133
00:05:08,927 --> 00:05:10,489
Football players
are meant to be hurt.

134
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:12,021
I'm meant to be
cherished.

135
00:05:12,106 --> 00:05:15,005
Okay. Looks like
you fractured your ulna.

136
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,169
Oh, no.

137
00:05:16,254 --> 00:05:18,450
Two weeks in a cast,
you'll be good as new.

138
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:20,584
- A cast? Don't those get sweaty?
- Mm-hmm.

139
00:05:20,702 --> 00:05:22,153
- They can.
- And itchy?

140
00:05:22,276 --> 00:05:23,716
- A little.
- Can it get wet?

141
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:24,848
Not supposed to.

142
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:26,264
Then how am I supposed
to take a shower?

143
00:05:26,348 --> 00:05:27,962
Well, some people wrap it
in a garbage bag.

144
00:05:28,046 --> 00:05:29,660
That's where garbage goes.

145
00:05:29,745 --> 00:05:32,138
Did you get a discount doctor
because we're poor?

146
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:34,638
- Shelly, you okay?
- I fractured

147
00:05:34,723 --> 00:05:35,974
- my ulna.
- He's fine.

148
00:05:36,059 --> 00:05:37,561
I told you you didn't need
to come down here.

149
00:05:37,645 --> 00:05:40,021
My baby is
in the emergency room.

150
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,442
Yeah, with his father.

151
00:05:41,527 --> 00:05:42,960
Who let him get hurt.

152
00:05:43,045 --> 00:05:44,224
Me? I wasn't even there.

153
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:45,575
If anything,
it was Missy's fault.

154
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:47,055
And Belinda Sparks.

155
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,411
- Who?
- A chicken.

156
00:05:48,496 --> 00:05:50,458
What does a chicken
have to do with this?

157
00:05:50,543 --> 00:05:52,334
You know what,
I'm gonna let the nurse come in

158
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,083
and put the cast on.

159
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,966
Don't worry, baby.
You're gonna be just fine.

160
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:59,724
- Thanks, Mom.
- That's what I been saying the whole time.

161
00:05:59,843 --> 00:06:01,724
But she cherishes me.

162
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:06,956
That's so cool.

163
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,529
Can I sign it?

164
00:06:08,614 --> 00:06:09,778
Why?

165
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:11,519
'Cause that's what kids do.

166
00:06:11,603 --> 00:06:13,208
Why would I care
what kids do?

167
00:06:13,293 --> 00:06:15,777
So when it's over,
you can have a cool reminder?

168
00:06:15,862 --> 00:06:17,910
I don't want a reminder.
This is traumatic.

169
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,817
I might need counseling.

170
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,210
Come on, don't be lame.
Let me sign it.

171
00:06:22,295 --> 00:06:24,131
You're just gonna
write something mean.

172
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:26,373
You don't commit a crime
and sign your own name.

173
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,709
Learned that onethe hard way.

174
00:06:29,665 --> 00:06:31,264
Oh.

175
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,570
Hey, Brenda.

176
00:06:32,655 --> 00:06:36,070
Hey. I just
wanted to check in

177
00:06:36,155 --> 00:06:37,858
and see
how Sheldon's doing.

178
00:06:38,193 --> 00:06:40,506
He'll be fine.
It's just a little fracture.

179
00:06:40,619 --> 00:06:42,668
Oh. Poor kid.

180
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,545
Please know
we feel terrible.

181
00:06:46,732 --> 00:06:48,225
Eh, accidents happen.

182
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,585
Hey, speaking of accidents,

183
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:53,344
which this clearly was,

184
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,819
insurance covers
everything, right?

185
00:06:56,126 --> 00:06:58,499
If you're worried about me
sending you a bill, don't be.

186
00:06:58,661 --> 00:07:00,144
Wasn't worried.

187
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:02,952
I just wanted to bring you
some food as a peace offering

188
00:07:03,037 --> 00:07:06,038
and promise
it will never happen again.

189
00:07:06,256 --> 00:07:07,763
Well, thanks.

190
00:07:07,848 --> 00:07:09,538
Ooh, fried chicken.

191
00:07:12,055 --> 00:07:14,811
Never again.

192
00:07:15,364 --> 00:07:17,673
"I hope your arm
gets better soon.

193
00:07:17,843 --> 00:07:21,272
XO, Missy." See?

194
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,350
- Nothing mean.
- Thank you.

195
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,679
M <i>y sister could have
a big heart.</i>

196
00:07:25,764 --> 00:07:27,405
If only that were true
of her brain.

197
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,803
That's the wrong "your."

198
00:07:28,888 --> 00:07:30,057
What are you talking about?

199
00:07:30,142 --> 00:07:31,946
It's supposed to be
Y-O-U-R.

200
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:34,850
What you wrote means,
"I hope you are arm gets better."

201
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:36,533
Oh.

202
00:07:36,688 --> 00:07:39,069
You defaced my body
with a grammatical error.

203
00:07:39,154 --> 00:07:42,077
I guess that's yourproblem.
Y-O-U-R.

204
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:49,475
Left-handed knocking.
Wild.

205
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:52,061
- Georgie?
- What?

206
00:07:53,035 --> 00:07:55,474
You're left-handed.
Now that I've joined your ranks,

207
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,321
I was wondering if you could
tell me what to expect.

208
00:07:58,406 --> 00:08:00,715
I don't know.
To me, it's just normal.

209
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:03,022
But the vast majority of people
are right-handed.

210
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:05,022
There must be
some challenges.

211
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:07,622
It's hard to cut stuff
with scissors.

212
00:08:07,707 --> 00:08:09,810
Mom handles
most of my cutting needs.

213
00:08:09,895 --> 00:08:12,597
Uh, when you shake hands,
it's the wrong hand.

214
00:08:12,681 --> 00:08:15,336
I don't shake hands.
It's disgusting.

215
00:08:16,336 --> 00:08:17,862
Oh! When driving,

216
00:08:17,947 --> 00:08:19,430
the gear shifter's
on the right side.

217
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,332
And I'm not old enough
to drive.

218
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,900
Being a lefty
doesn't seem so bad.

219
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,107
I don't know why

220
00:08:24,192 --> 00:08:25,738
you complain so much.

221
00:08:29,527 --> 00:08:30,950
Don't worry, baby.

222
00:08:31,035 --> 00:08:33,605
I cut everything into
bite-size pieces for you.

223
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,975
Maybe you could chew it up
and spit it in his mouth.

224
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:38,591
Please?
Let's just say grace.

225
00:08:42,765 --> 00:08:44,683
Will you two help him
with his mittens?

226
00:08:44,768 --> 00:08:46,121
Maybe he doesn't wear them.

227
00:08:46,206 --> 00:08:47,558
Then I'm not holding hands.

228
00:08:47,643 --> 00:08:49,387
- We ain't gotto hold hands?
- Sweet.

229
00:08:49,472 --> 00:08:52,070
I like when we hold hands.
We are holding hands.

230
00:08:52,155 --> 00:08:53,420
Let's go.
Mittens.

231
00:08:53,504 --> 00:08:54,840
- Fine.
- Fine.

232
00:08:54,956 --> 00:08:56,724
Gently. Gently.

233
00:08:56,809 --> 00:08:57,896
I'm doing it gently.

234
00:08:57,981 --> 00:08:59,818
Well, your tone
suggests otherwise.

235
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,296
Just give me your hand.

236
00:09:02,515 --> 00:09:03,908
Gently.

237
00:09:05,217 --> 00:09:07,436
There.

238
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:12,169
Bless us, Lord,
for the food, we are about to receive,

239
00:09:12,254 --> 00:09:13,801
and bless the hands
that prepared it.

240
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:17,022
And bless Sheldon's arm
to heal strong and quick.

241
00:09:17,107 --> 00:09:18,199
Strongly and quickly.

242
00:09:18,284 --> 00:09:19,462
Amen.

243
00:09:19,547 --> 00:09:20,845
Amen.

244
00:09:21,314 --> 00:09:23,814
I've never operated a fork
with my left hand before.

245
00:09:23,986 --> 00:09:25,056
I hope this goes well.

246
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,338
When my buddy Mikey
got the cast off his leg,

247
00:09:27,423 --> 00:09:30,255
you would not believe
how skinny and smelly it was.

248
00:09:30,422 --> 00:09:32,557
Like beef jerky with toes.

249
00:09:32,642 --> 00:09:34,041
Can we please just eat?

250
00:09:36,678 --> 00:09:37,736
Chicken's good.

251
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:39,436
Mrs. Sparks made it.

252
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:40,984
Huh?

253
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,885
My first
bathroom attempt.

254
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,888
Let's hope
this goes well.

255
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,244
Let me know
if you need help.

256
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:51,603
I think I'll be okay.

257
00:09:51,696 --> 00:09:53,299
It's just number one.

258
00:09:53,622 --> 00:09:55,330

00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:18,095
What does that have
to do with me?

323
00:12:19,992 --> 00:12:22,998
You have made it your life's
mission to hold him up.

324
00:12:23,347 --> 00:12:25,057
What are you saying here?

325
00:12:25,176 --> 00:12:27,529
That I am wrong to love
and protect my son?

326
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:30,284
That he doesn't need his
mother to keep an eye on him?

327
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:31,808
I'm not saying that. I...

328
00:12:31,893 --> 00:12:33,463
I would never say that.

329
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,588
All right then.

330
00:12:38,323 --> 00:12:39,838
I'm not an idiot.

331
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:43,284
Did you have

332
00:12:43,368 --> 00:12:45,682
a tough time when your kids
started being independent?

333
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:47,034
I'll let you know.

334
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:48,729
What does that mean?

335
00:12:48,814 --> 00:12:50,819
Means one of 'em is still
sitting in my kitchen

336
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:52,659
whining about something.

337
00:12:52,986 --> 00:12:56,342
Could you be supportive
for once?

338
00:12:57,182 --> 00:13:00,534
Yes, watching your kids
grow up is hard.

339
00:13:00,619 --> 00:13:02,319
So how do you handle it?

340
00:13:02,404 --> 00:13:05,062
I find a little bourbon
in my coffee does the trick.

341
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:07,339
And we're back
to being not helpful.

342
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:11,355
Look, you haven't even gotten
to the worst part of it yet.

343
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,440
They're gonna leave home.

344
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,979
- They're gonna move to another city.
- Oh, Lord.

345
00:13:15,064 --> 00:13:19,096
They're gonna tell you their loser
boyfriend has knocked them up.

346
00:13:19,563 --> 00:13:22,424
- Just to be clear, that would be you.
- Sorry.

347
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:25,717
- Turned my hair gray overnight.
- I said sorry.

348
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:27,743
Clearly, you're not
in the mood to help.

349
00:13:28,325 --> 00:13:31,897
Listen, it's hard
being a parent,

350
00:13:31,982 --> 00:13:35,518
but if you do it right,
they don't need you anymore.

351
00:13:35,964 --> 00:13:37,795
Well, I don't like that.

352
00:13:38,573 --> 00:13:41,784
I get it,
but I just don't like it.

353
00:13:42,228 --> 00:13:45,830
Well, I'd point out,
you'll always have your husband,

354
00:13:45,953 --> 00:13:48,878
but you want me
to be "helpful."

355
00:13:51,635 --> 00:13:54,635

359
00:14:01,463 --> 00:14:03,924
Listing Nobel Prize winners
in physics.

360
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,274
Why?

361
00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:07,667
To keep me from cracking
this cast like a coconut

362
00:14:07,752 --> 00:14:09,417
and scratching my skin off.

363
00:14:09,604 --> 00:14:11,706
I need Mom
to sing "Soft Kitty."

364
00:14:11,891 --> 00:14:13,159
Don't do it.

365
00:14:13,244 --> 00:14:14,509
Why?

366
00:14:14,594 --> 00:14:16,034
You're being a baby again.

367
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:17,253
But I'm injured.

368
00:14:17,636 --> 00:14:19,471
Big deal.
You broke your arm.

369
00:14:19,845 --> 00:14:21,760
Look at Stephen
Hawking over there.

370
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:23,487
He's in a wheelchair.

371
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,526
You don't hear him whining
about it with his robot voice.

372
00:14:29,017 --> 00:14:31,620
So you're saying
he and I are brilliant minds

373
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:34,495
who have both suffered
great physical adversity.

374
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,454
That's not even close
to what I'm saying.

375
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:38,431
Well, that's what I heard.

376
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,190
And if Hawking
doesn't let it stop him,

377
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:43,417
then I can't
let this cast stop me.

378
00:14:43,502 --> 00:14:45,003
Great. Go back to sleep.

379
00:14:45,316 --> 00:14:48,338
I will, and I'll do it
all by myself.

1
00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:03,935
<i>Previously on</i> Young Sheldon...
Paige?

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:05,837
I'm so happy to see you.

3
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:07,205
Are you happy to see me?

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,207
Not immediately.

5
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:11,410
I don't usually see young people
at my lectures.

6
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:14,312
I enjoyed your paper on
accelerator mass spectrometry

7
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:15,680
and wanted to find out more.

8
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:18,350
And you?
I read this magazine.

9
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,685
Uh-huh.
It has puzzles, too.

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,587
Well, I think my parents
are getting a divorce.

11
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:25,390
Why?
They fight all the time.

12
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:28,360
I guess I'm lucky.
Why?

13
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:31,397
I'm the glue that holds
our family together.

14
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,907
What do you think of these?

15
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:44,242
They're nice, but you're
already taller than John.

16
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:45,710
Won't they make that worse?

17
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:47,546
No, makes it better.

18
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,281
He likes me to be dominating.

19
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:51,083
I don't want to hear that.

20
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:55,554
Sometimes he makes me wear these
when we're... messing around.

21
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:57,989
I said I don't
want to hear it.

22
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,092
I wanted to say it.

23
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:03,462
All right, I don't have the
Sperry loafers in your size,

24
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:05,697
but I do have the Hush Puppies.

25
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,200
I don't wear brown Hush
Puppies penny loafers,

26
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,469
I wear brown Sperry
penny loafers.

27
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:12,537
But they're exactly the same.
Well, do they come

28
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,372
in a box that says
Sperry penny loafers?

29
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,007
Because that one
says Hush Puppies.

30
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:17,943
Just try 'em on, honey.

31
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:20,812
What if I like them?
Well, then we'll get them.

32
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:23,081
All right, let's go
over this again.

33
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,417
I don't wear brown Hush
Puppies penny loafers,

34
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,018
I wear brown Sperry...

35
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:28,253
Would you give us a moment?

36
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,988
Happily.

37
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:32,157
When we get to
the Hello Kitty store today,

38
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,259
remember I was the good child.

39
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:35,894
Oh, hi, Mary.

40
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,762
Linda. So good to see you.

41
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:40,165
Hi, Sheldon.
Hello, Paige.

42
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,833
Hi, Missy.
Hi!

43
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:44,603
Look at these rain boots--
they have ducks on them.

44
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,571
And the ducks
are wearing boots.

45
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,440
Those are so cute.

46
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,910
Well, what a nice coincidence.
Yeah.

47
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:52,911
Good to see you.

48
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,045
Yeah. How are things?

49
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,180
Well, at the moment,

50
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:56,648
trying to get shoes for Sheldon,

51
00:01:56,683 --> 00:02:00,051
but they only have these,
not the ones he likes.

52
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:05,657
Ah. You know, I think that brand
is the same kind Einstein wore.

53
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:08,460
Well, I've never seen a picture
of his feet.

54
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,029
And you're a grown-up,
so you wouldn't lie to me.

55
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:14,666
I guess I have no choice
but to believe you.

56
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,368
All right, I'll try them.

57
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:19,004
Great!

58
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,073
Hey, Mom, can Missy and I go
to the Hello Kitty store?

59
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,609
Well, it's okay with me
if it's okay with Mary.

60
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,479
It's okay, but you better be
on your best behavior.

61
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:28,914
I will, I promise.

62
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:29,948
Go ahead.

63
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,717
Boy, you steal
one pencil sharpener

64
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,753
and you never hear
the end of it.

65
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,657
How do they feel?

66
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:42,528
My brand loyalty is being
severely tested.

67
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:47,265
<i> Nobody else
is stronger than I am </i>

68
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,935
<i> Yesterday I moved a mountain </i>

69
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,637
<i> I bet I could be your hero </i>

70
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,906
<i> I am a mighty little man </i>

71
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:59,411
I am a mighty little man.

72
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:08,620
Did you guys know Paige
speaks three languages?

73
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,389
Really?
That's impressive.

74
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,525
You only speak one.

75
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,661
Two. I'm learning
conversational Klingon.

76
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,263
That's impressive, too.

77
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,534
Hey, Mom, can Paige
sleep over this weekend?

78
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,803
I guess,
if her mother says okay.

79
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:27,005
Wait, where is she
going to sleep?

80
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,140
In your bed.
You can sleep on the couch.

81
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,475
Absolutely not.

82
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,310
I've already changed
my brand of loafers,

83
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:35,547
I am not changing
my sleeping quarters.

84
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,716
How about you stay at
Meemaw's? You like that.

85
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,951
No, Meemaw has a date.

86
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:40,752
So?

87
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,254
So if those shoes I just bought

88
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,688
do their job,

89
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,724
that will be a "no children
allowed" scenario.

90
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,961
Well, I'm sleeping in my bed,
and that's that.

91
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,297
Fine, Paige and I
can share my bed.

92
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,832
You okay with that, Shelly?

93
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:57,736
I trust you two will stay quiet
throughout the evening

94
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,604
and go to sleep at
the appropriate time?

95
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,040
Absolutely.

96
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,843
All right, then.
I'm okay with it, Mom.

97
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,847
How is he ever gonna
get through this world?

98
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,952
Welcome, come on in.

99
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,820
Oh, thank you.

100
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,423
You look nice. Going out
to dinner with your husband?

101
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,258
Ugh, no. Girlfriends.

102
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,493
Hi, Sheldon.

103
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:22,994
Hello.

104
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,062
What are you doing?

105
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,097
Chemistry homework
for extra credit.

106
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,966
Cute, I did that last year.

107
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,768
Paige!

108
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,503
Missy!

109
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,705
Aw, they're so sweet.

110
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,309
Yeah, life'll suck that
right out of them soon enough.

111
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:38,743
Well, bye.
Bye.

112
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,080
You got to meet my dolls--
I told them all about you!

113
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:48,153
"Cute, I did that last year."

114
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,522
Thank you for agreeing
to the early-bird dinner.

115
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:54,626
When I eat too late,
the food just sits right here.

116
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,028
Yeah, gettin' old
is no party.

117
00:04:57,063 --> 00:05:00,198
Oh, I've had this problem
since I was ten.

118
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:05,170
When I was in grade school,
my nickname was Old Burpy.

119
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:08,106
Well, I will not be
calling you that.

120
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,374
You can if you'd like.

121
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,775
I'm good.

122
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,545
So, I have a little surprise
for you.

123
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,680
Oh, I love surprises.
Whatcha got?

124
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,549
I'm going to learn to drive.

125
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,384
Really?

126
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,752
Yes.

127
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:24,022
While I love having you be
the dominant personality

128
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:27,525
behind closed doors,
I think out in public

129
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,494
I ought to take on
more of a macho role.

130
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,798
Well, you're macho enough
for me, John,

131
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,268
but I would enjoy not having
to drive us all the time.

132
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:38,470
Then it's settled.

133
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,205
Well, when do you start?

134
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,806
As soon as you teach me.

135
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,810
Me? Do you really think
that's a good idea?

136
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,280
It's perfect.
I teach you about science

137
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:50,815
so you can impress
your grandson,

138
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,853
and you teach me to drive
so I can impress you.

139
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:59,357
Okay, but if we do this,
I'm in charge.

140
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:04,329
You have to do what I say when
and how I tell you to do it.

141
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:08,433
Hubba-hubba, it's like
we're back in the bedroom.

142
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:13,571
Did you know that tea was
discovered by accident?

143
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:16,107
I didn't, but I don't know
lots of stuff.

144
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,810
The Emperor Shennong of China
was boiling water in his garden

145
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,446
and a leaf from a tea tree
fell into his pot.

146
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,715
Tea comes from trees?

147
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,984
Where'd you think
it comes from?

148
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:29,020
The supermarket.

149
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,257
What, the girls leave you out
of their little picnic?

150
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:33,658
Oh, they invited him.

151
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,026
Well, then why ain't you
out there?

152
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,329
Eat outdoors? Do I look
like a hippie to you?

153
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:39,998
I thought Paige
was your friend.

154
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,966
She's more of a colleague.

155
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:42,801
Oh.

156
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,135
Although for reasons unknown,

157
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,337
she's currently behaving
like a ten-year-old.

158
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:48,773
Maybe that's because she
is a ten-year-old.

159
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,208
Still no excuse.

160
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,012
All right, I'm just gonna
come out and ask it:

161
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:56,648
what the heck
is a colleague?

162
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:04,989
Okay, pick a number.

163
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:05,890
Three.

164
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,759
One, two, three.

165
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,360
Now pick a color.

166
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,628
Pink, duh.

167
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:15,433
The name of
your future pony is...

168
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,368
Sparkle Sunshine.

169
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,404
I would totally name it that!

170
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,373
Sheldon, do you want to
have your fortune read?

171
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,042
Absolutely not.

172
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:27,278
And I cannot believe a person
as smart as you is doing it.

173
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,180
Why? It's fun.

174
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:32,684
He doesn't know how to have fun;
he's an old man.

175
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,052
I'm not an old man.

176
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,387
Oh, yeah?
What's your favorite color?

177
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:37,655
Khaki.

178
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,958
Old man.

179
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,634
I'm trying to sleep.

180
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,636
Come inside and play with us.

181
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:52,837
Don't invite him.

182
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:54,172
This is a girls' fort,

183
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,607
not an old man fort.

184
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,809
I'm not an old man.

185
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,077
Then come inside.

186
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:01,279
Are you crazy? It's bedtime.

187
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,982
Old man.

188
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,917
(Paige and Missy laughing)

189
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

190
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,136
What are you doing?

191
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,539
We're tying
Georgie's ankles together.

192
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:30,441
So when he gets
out of bed he falls down.

193
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:31,843
But he could get hurt.

194
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,578
If we're lucky.

195
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:36,014
Well, I will not be
a party to this.

196
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,582
Old man.

197
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:44,956
That's when
the bloodthirsty Goatman--

198
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,125
part goat, part man--

199
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,529
crept up on the
sleeping children...
No.

200
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:56,467
...and sank his sharp little
teeth into their necks...
No.

201
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:58,670
...and drank their blood!

202
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,338
No.

203
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,839
Problem?

204
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,075
Several. First of all,
goats are herbivores.

205
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,277
They don't eat meat,
let alone drink blood.

206
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,413
Maybe the half man part
drinks blood.

207
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:11,783
Don't even get me started
on the "half man" stuff.

208
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:15,186
Sheldon, it's just
a fun scary story.

209
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,255
It's nonsense is what it is.

210
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,489
Old man.

211
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,291
I'm not an old man, I'm ten.

212
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:21,693
More like 110.

213
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:25,163
You know, I read that adults
who had a stunted childhood

214
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,865
often become social misfits
and weirdos.

215
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,500
You didn't read that,
you're making it up

216
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,069
like your goat story.

217

<i>Psychology Magazine,</i>
February issue, 1988.

218
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,808
Well, um...

219
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:39,210
That doesn't make it true.

220
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,245
Guess you'll find out
when you're an adult.

221
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,148
I guess I will.

222
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,219
<i> Well, we know</i>
<i>how this story ends.</i>

223
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,321
<i>I grew up to become</i>
<i>a well-adjusted</i>

224
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,390
<i>and charming fellow.</i>
<i>But at that moment in time,</i>

225
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,625
<i>she had me worried.</i>

226
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,296
<i> Hey, Georgie, breakfast.</i>
<i>Mom made Eggos.</i>

227
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,331
<i>Eggos, sweet.</i>

228
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,700
<i>Ow! Dang it!</i>

229
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:12,644
Oh, dear.

230
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,678
What?

231
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,246
Paige was right.

232
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,248
"There's ample evidence
to indicate

233
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,551
"that a stunted childhood
can cause one to be maladjusted

234
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:21,686
as an adult."

235
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:22,954
Then I'm screwed.

236
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,489
What do you mean?

237
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:27,191
When I'm not in school,
I'm doing homework.

238
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,961
When I'm not doing homework,
I'm practicing my cello.

239
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,396
And when I'm not doing that,

240
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,197
I'm working
in my parents' store.

241
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,800
That must be why we're friends.

242
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,035
We're both stunted.

243
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,403
Sounds right.

244
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:41,572
Well, I for one
plan to do something about it.

245
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,241
Like what?

246
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:46,244
I'm going to goof off,
engage in horseplay,

247
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,613
and if time permits,
be quite immature.

248
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,981
If time permits?

249
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,116
I have homework, too.

250
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,318
Would you like to join me
in my shenanigans?

251
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,653
No, thanks.

252
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:59,123
Aren't you concerned about
being a maladjusted adult?

253
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,726
Nah. I'll just marry
an American woman

254
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,295
and hope she can fix me.

255
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,869
I'm usually the one
giving the tests,

256
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:15,006
but, uh, today I'm<i> taking</i> one.

257
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,274
No talking.

258
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:20,979
And I usually say that
to my students.

259
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,017
What?

260
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,052
How's it going?

261
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:31,089
I can't tell you.
There's no talking.

262
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:33,958
No talking.
Sorry.

263
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,000
Mind if I join you?

264
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,001
Doing what?

265
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,304
Swinging.
Seriously?

266
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:49,140
Yes. It's my hope to feel
the wind in my hair

267
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,609
and be carefree.
Um, okay.

268
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:08,960
Sheldon threw up on me.
Sheldon threw up on me!

269
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,898
Okay, rearview mirrors.

270
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,167
Um, all set.

271
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,937
Turn signal left.
Turn signal right.

272
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,707
Um, foot on the brake.

273
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,311
Transmission in drive.

274
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,950
You have to start
the car first.

275
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:35,086
Of course.

276
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,654
Sorry, I'm a bit nervous.

277
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,422
You're not alone.

278
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,095
And here we go.

279
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:52,103
This is crazy.

280
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,938
I'm doing it.

281
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,318
Excuse me, I was
hoping to purchase

282
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,353
some practical joke
paraphernalia

283
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,556
so that I may behave
childishly.

284
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:12,857
Rack in the corner.

285
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,292
Thank you.

286
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:32,577
"If it's funny, it's a Bazinga."

287
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,012
Interesting.

288
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,620
Yellow light.
Yellow light!

289
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,888
It's okay, keep going.

290
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,289
But yellow means slow down.

291
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,624
You can't slow down
in the intersection!

292
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,125
Keep going.

293
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,794
Are you sure?
Yes.

294
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,895
Go. Go!

295
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:03,841
Oh, God. Oh, God.

296
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,243
Oh...

297
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:06,744
I'm so sorry.

298
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,713
It's okay, we're fine.

299
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:10,181
Nobody got hurt.

300
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,849
I don't think I can
do this, Connie.

301
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,285
Of course you can.
We're just getting started.

302
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,655
No, it's too much information.
I can't process it.

303
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,457
It was just a yellow light.

304
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:22,660
Not just the light.
There were other cars.

305
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,728
There's pedestrians.

306
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:26,364
There was a guy on a bicycle.
So?

307
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,232
That's just too many
random elements.

308
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,935
The-the-the stimuli
are overwhelming.

309
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,638
Okay. Okay.

310
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:39,076
I'm sorry.
I know I'm letting you down.

311
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:41,979
Oh, don't be silly.
You're not letting me down.

312
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,151
I love you whether
you can drive or not.

313
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,655
You love me?

314
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:56,694
Well, I...

315
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,496
I suppose I do.

316
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:03,367
Am I allowed
to reciprocate?

317
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,971
Sure, if that's
the way you feel.

318
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,973
Oh, it is.

319
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,242
I love you, too, Connie.

320
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:14,445
Well...

321
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:18,950
That's just great.

322
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:21,686
All righty.

323
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,156
Would you like to
switch seats with me?

324
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,625
Yes, but give me a minute

325
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,494
because my legs are
a little wobbly.

326
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,731
Is that from the yellow light
or the "I love yous"?

327
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,966
Both.

328
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,906
Dad, would you care for
a piece of gum?

329
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,274
No, thank you.

330
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,042
Please, take a piece of gum.

331
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,277
Why?

332
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,712
Just please.

333
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:52,784
Bazinga.

334
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,886
You understand any of that?

335
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:58,756
I don't know, I guess
he's just being a little boy.

336
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,391
Since when?

337
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:03,627
Georgie? Georgie?

338
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:04,729
What?

339
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:09,033
Would you like some
salted mixed nuts?

340
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,067
Nah.

341
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,869
Look, they're the fancy kind.

342
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,304
That's a trick can.

343
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,839
No, it's not.

344
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:17,041
Listen. When you shake it,
there's a rattling sound,

345
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,642
as if nuts are inside.

346
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,913
Fine.

347
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,919
Bazinga.

348
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:33,090
Sparks residence,
Billy speaking.

349
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,492
This is the electric company.

350
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:35,726
Hello.

351
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,295
I'm calling to see
if your refrigerator is running.

352
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,898
I'll go check.

353
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,703
I'm back. It's running.

354
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,171
Well, then you better
go catch it.

355
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:50,808
Bazinga.

356
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:53,978
This is Connie Tucker.

357
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,014
Leave a message
when you hear the...<i> beep.</i>

358
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:01,118
Hello, um, Meemaw,

359
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,753
this is Sheldon.

360
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:07,358
If you were home, I was going
to say, "Is Mr. Wall there?"

361
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:08,759
And then you would say, "No."

362
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:11,962
And then I would say,
"Is Mrs. Wall there?"

363
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:13,497
And then you would say, "No."

364
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,800
And then I would say,
"Well, if there are no walls,

365
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:19,070
then how does your roof
stay up?"

366
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:22,139
Um, okay. Bazinga.

367
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:25,709
That was pathetic.

368
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,278
It was.

369
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:31,015
I'm not sure I'm cut out for
these antics and shenanigans.

370
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,751
I guess you're gonna
grow up to be a weirdo.

371
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,986
I suppose I am.

372
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:38,255
Life is so confusing.

373
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,258
I always hoped
it would be easier for me

374
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:42,827
when I grew up, but...

375
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,031
...now I'm not so sure it will.

376
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,266
It's gonna be all right.

377
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:57,942
You were faking?

378
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,446
Bazinga.

379
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,081
<i>And that's how I became</i>

380
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:07,952
<i>the madcap prankster</i>
<i>all my friends know and love.</i>

381
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,560
So, John, how was
your first driving lesson?

382
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,762
Intense.

383
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:19,730
At one point,

384
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,832
I was approaching
an intersection.

385
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:24,802
The light was green,
but at the last moment,

386
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,170
it turned yellow.

387
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,404
I didn't know what to do.

388
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,141
Should I keep going?
Should I stop?

389
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,276
There were
other cars nearby.

390
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:33,477
Connie was yelling.

391
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,046
A glare from the sun
was in my eyes.

392
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,348
So, what happened?

393
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:39,450
Somehow, I managed
to make it through,

394
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,318
turned on my directional,

395
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:43,053
and slowly pulled

396
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:44,955
to the side of the road.

397
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,993
That's how you
tell a scary story.

398
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,097
In lighter news,
your meemaw loves me.

398
00:18:54,305 --> 00:19:54,257

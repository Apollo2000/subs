1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,004
In tenth grade,
high school students

2
00:00:04,047 --> 00:00:06,832
are presented with picking
a class of their own choosing.

3
00:00:06,876 --> 00:00:09,661
This is called an elective.

4
00:00:09,705 --> 00:00:12,360
Courses on offer
included wood shop...

5
00:00:12,403 --> 00:00:14,449
I'm happy with ten fingers,
thank you.

6
00:00:14,492 --> 00:00:17,060
Introduction to agriculture...

7
00:00:17,104 --> 00:00:19,019
I think you know
the answer to that.

8
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:20,585
Wrestling...

9
00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:23,458
I'd rather milk that cow.

10
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:26,939
All of which led me to the
elective I reluctantly chose...

11
00:00:26,983 --> 00:00:30,073
Psychology 101, an investigation

12
00:00:30,117 --> 00:00:34,077
into why people think and feel
the way they do.

13
00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:35,252
All right,

14
00:00:35,296 --> 00:00:36,949
with Thanksgiving
weekend approaching,

15
00:00:36,993 --> 00:00:38,492
it's the perfect
opportunity to observe

16
00:00:38,516 --> 00:00:42,129
family dynamics and how
our parents, relatives

17
00:00:42,172 --> 00:00:43,347
and siblings affect us.

18
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:44,479
Now, the...

19
00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:46,350
Yes, Sheldon.

20
00:00:46,394 --> 00:00:48,265
I don't find that interesting.

21
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:50,050
Well, tough knuckles,
that's the assignment.

22
00:00:50,093 --> 00:00:53,183
Now, you'll all be expected
to collect data on your family,

23
00:00:53,227 --> 00:00:55,707
form a hypothesis,
and make a prediction.

24
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:58,406
So you're giving us
homework for Thanksgiving?

25
00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:00,408
Yes.

26
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:02,540
Boy!

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

28
00:01:23,518 --> 00:01:26,216
Hey, listen, something
came up today

29
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,479
that we need to talk about.
What's that?

30
00:01:28,523 --> 00:01:31,395
I maybe have a shot
at a better job.

31
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,225
George, they're finally
gonna make you head coach?

32
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:36,487
Better than that.

33
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:39,055
Special Teams Coach,
University of Tulsa.

34
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,013
In Oklahoma?

35
00:01:41,057 --> 00:01:43,364
That is where they're keeping
Tulsa these days.

36
00:01:43,407 --> 00:01:44,974
No need to be lippy.

37
00:01:45,017 --> 00:01:47,411
You're not seriously
thinking about moving

38
00:01:47,455 --> 00:01:50,022
this whole family
to Oklahoma, are you?

39
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:52,329
It's 400 miles away,
I wasn't gonna commute.

40
00:01:52,373 --> 00:01:53,722
Well, that's not gonna work.

41
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:57,160
The kids are all settled in
with school and friends,

42
00:01:57,204 --> 00:01:58,857
and I've got my job
at the church,

43
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:00,250
and then there's Mom.

44
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:02,165
Am I supposed to just
walk away from her?

45
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:03,993
No, what you're supposed to do

46
00:02:04,036 --> 00:02:06,038
is support my efforts
to improve our life.

47
00:02:13,785 --> 00:02:15,613
Notes for psychology paper.

48
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:16,832
What you doing?

49
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:19,617
Shh. Family conflict
has been observed.

50
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:23,491
Subject M and Subject D have
opposing views on relocating.

51
00:02:23,534 --> 00:02:27,190
You better not be recording
over my Janet Jackson tape.

52
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:28,844
Would you please?

53
00:02:28,887 --> 00:02:30,715
Who's Subject M and Subject D?

54
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:33,327
I can't tell you that,
you might skew the results.

55
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,199
Okay, then tell me
what skew means.

56
00:02:36,243 --> 00:02:38,288
Are you going to talk
the whole time?

57
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:41,465
It seems to be annoying you,
so, yeah.

58
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:49,386
Mary, I just can't thank you
enough for inviting me today.

59
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,563
You're very welcome, John.
Love having you here.

60
00:02:52,607 --> 00:02:56,219
Last Thanksgiving, I just sat
in my apartment all by myself

61
00:02:56,263 --> 00:02:58,265
and ate a turkey sandwich.

62
00:02:58,308 --> 00:02:59,744
That is so sad.

63
00:02:59,788 --> 00:03:01,877
Well, it wasn't at the time,

64
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,096
but now that I have something
to compare it to,

65
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,664
I realize what
a pathetic loser I was.

66
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:09,058
You were never a loser.

67
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:11,321
Yeah, you were.

68
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:13,584
Hey, Georgie,

69
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:15,978
you have any sentimental
attachment to this town?

70
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:18,415
I don't know, why? I'm just curious if,

71
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:20,591
you know, we ever did
pick up and live somewhere else,

72
00:03:20,635 --> 00:03:21,853
how you'd feel about it.

73
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,161
Well, if it was Hawaii,
I'd feel pretty great.

74
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,486
That's where they make
Magnum, P.I.

75
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,121
I don't think Hawaii's
in the cards.

76
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:30,427
How about Miami?

77
00:03:30,471 --> 00:03:32,342
Let me guess,
'cause of Miami Vice?

78
00:03:32,386 --> 00:03:34,083
Golden Girls.

79
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:35,606
Course.

80
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,868
Car.

81
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:39,697
I saw this one

82
00:03:39,741 --> 00:03:41,395
where Blanche dates
this little guy

83
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:45,399
who breaks up with her 'cause
she's not Jewish. So good.

84
00:03:45,442 --> 00:03:49,054
Forget about Miami
and Hawaii and Blanche.

85
00:03:49,098 --> 00:03:51,840
I mean, how do you feel about
not staying in Medford forever?

86
00:03:51,883 --> 00:03:53,711
Well, I guess
I'd be okay with it.

87
00:03:53,755 --> 00:03:55,539
All right.

88
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,193
Good to know.

89
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,240
Subject D is attempting
to influence Subject G

90
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:01,458
regarding relocating.

91
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:02,764
What about you, Sheldon?

92
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:05,506
What about me what?

93
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:07,551
Could you ever see yourself
leaving Medford?

94
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:11,425
I'm sorry, Dad,
but I'm unable to express

95
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:13,122
an opinion at this time.

96
00:04:13,165 --> 00:04:14,210
Why not?

97
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,820
In the interest of science,

98
00:04:15,864 --> 00:04:17,953
I have to remain
a neutral observer.

99
00:04:17,996 --> 00:04:21,391
Glad I asked.

100
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:24,133
Hey, fellows, may I join?

101
00:04:24,176 --> 00:04:26,744
Sure. Here you go.

102
00:04:28,572 --> 00:04:30,008
Dang, nice catch.

103
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:34,578
Car.

104
00:04:36,754 --> 00:04:38,634
Listen, I'm gonna need
your help with something.

105
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:40,454
Is it about money? No.

106
00:04:40,497 --> 00:04:42,760
Then I'm your gal. What's up?

107
00:04:42,804 --> 00:04:45,850
George is up for a coaching job
at the University of Tulsa.

108
00:04:45,894 --> 00:04:48,375
Tulsa?

109
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:51,421
Last year, I lost $800
on that damn team.

110
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:53,336
I'm sorry to hear that.

111
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,338
I'm fine with most
of the Division I stuff,

112
00:04:55,382 --> 00:04:57,688
but these independent teams,

113
00:04:57,732 --> 00:05:00,430
I j... I just can't seem
to get a handle on it.

114
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:03,564
You think if George got that job
he might give me an inside line?

115
00:05:03,607 --> 00:05:04,956
Mom.

116
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,480
Well, I'd cut him in,

117
00:05:06,523 --> 00:05:08,264
make it look like
a Christmas present.

118
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,613
Would you please listen to me?

119
00:05:09,657 --> 00:05:10,962
If we move up there,

120
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:12,660
other than holidays,

121
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:14,531
you're not gonna
see your grandkids.

122
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:17,360
That's a point.

123
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:20,581
You make it sound like
a Sophie's Choicekind of deal.

124
00:05:20,624 --> 00:05:23,888
During dinner,
maybe you could express

125
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:27,414
how devastating it would be
to be away from the kids.

126
00:05:27,457 --> 00:05:30,286
Well, I don't think I'd use
the word "devastating."

127
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,461
That doesn't sound like me.

128
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:34,464
Okay, well,
use whatever word you want.

129
00:05:34,508 --> 00:05:38,468
I might use... "heartbroken."

130
00:05:38,512 --> 00:05:40,470
Good, use that.

131
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:43,168
Yeah, maybe.
Have you got a thesaurus?

132
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:49,566
Dear.

133
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,699
Don't be scared, Sheldon,
it's just a parade.

134
00:05:51,742 --> 00:05:53,483
I already don't like dogs.

135
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:55,659
Gigantic and floating
does not help.

136
00:05:55,703 --> 00:05:58,575
Hey, how's the parade? MISSY Great.

137
00:05:58,619 --> 00:06:00,490
Alf is one of the hosts.

138
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:04,494
Alf, cool. Hey, so listen,

139
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:07,018
how attached are you
to living here in Medford?

140
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:08,368
I don't know what that means.

141
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:09,847
If we moved away,

142
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:12,937
do you have really good friends
that you'd miss a lot?

143
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:14,417
I have really good friends,

144
00:06:14,461 --> 00:06:16,201
but I think they
would mostly miss me.

145
00:06:16,245 --> 00:06:18,029
'Cause you make friends
wherever you go.

146
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:20,118
I do. People are drawn to me.

147
00:06:22,338 --> 00:06:24,558
Sorry, I'm neutral.

148
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:27,450
Okay, so what I'm hearing
is that

149
00:06:27,474 --> 00:06:29,389
you'd be happy no matter
where we lived.

150
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:31,608
I guess. Dad, please,
I'm trying to watch TV.

151
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:35,090
Sorry. I'll leave you to it.

152
00:06:40,095 --> 00:06:42,314
Dear, Big Bird.

153
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,283
You're making a sandwich?

154
00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:56,024
I'm a creature of habit.

155
00:06:57,329 --> 00:06:59,027
Hey, why don't we all
go around the table

156
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,029
and say what we're thankful for?

157
00:07:01,072 --> 00:07:02,683
Come on, really?

158
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:04,075
Yes, really.

159
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:05,468
I'll start.

160
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:09,037
I'm thankful to be surrounded
by my loving family.

161
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,865
What about that guy?

162
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:12,693
That guy... Dr. Sturgis...

163
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:14,608
Is part of our extended family.

164
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:16,218
Thank you.

165
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:20,178
And I'm also thankful
for this warm and comfy home

166
00:07:20,222 --> 00:07:23,094
that God has blessed us with
and this great neighborhood

167
00:07:23,138 --> 00:07:25,009
with my mom living

168
00:07:25,053 --> 00:07:26,184
right across the street,

169
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:29,187
and of course our excellent

170
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:31,668
school system that
provides our children

171
00:07:31,712 --> 00:07:33,888
with a world-class education.

172
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:35,846
Missy?

173
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,545
I'm thankful that there's two
different Ghostbustercartoons.

174
00:07:38,588 --> 00:07:39,850
That's it?

175
00:07:39,894 --> 00:07:41,635
Unless you know
about a third one.

176
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:44,202
Okay, my turn.

177
00:07:44,246 --> 00:07:47,510
Um, I am so thankful
to be able to watch

178
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:48,946
my grandchildren grow up.

179
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,905
And I can't even tell you

180
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:52,428
how much it means to me

181
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,996
that y'all live
right across the street.

182
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,998
And if y'all weren't,

183
00:07:57,041 --> 00:08:00,262
I would just be... heartbroken.

184
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,745
And not just heartbroken...

185
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:08,009
Crestfallen and chagrined.

186
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:09,750
And,

187
00:08:09,793 --> 00:08:11,186
I'm also thankful for my health,

188
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:13,841
that that mole on my hip
turned out to be nothing,

189
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:15,320
and,

190
00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:17,192
I'm very thankful for John here,

191
00:08:17,235 --> 00:08:18,889
who has

192
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:21,631
brought so much happiness to me.

193
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:25,983
That's it for me.

194
00:08:26,027 --> 00:08:28,769
- My.
- Aw, lovely, Mom.

195
00:08:28,812 --> 00:08:30,379
My, I don't know where to begin.

196
00:08:30,422 --> 00:08:34,644
Well, first of all,
I'm thankful to you, Connie,

197
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:39,127
for how you make me laugh,
make me feel cared for,

198
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:42,217
all the ways you're
affectionate to me

199
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,699
that I can't discuss
in-in front of children

200
00:08:45,742 --> 00:08:48,223
because that would be
inappropriate, right?

201
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:49,267
Right.

202
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:52,575
And I'm thankful to be here

203
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:55,143
with your wonderful family.

204
00:08:55,186 --> 00:08:59,277
This is something I didn't
experience growing up.

205
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:03,499
See, my father was away
a great deal on business

206
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,415
and it was just me and my mother

207
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:09,940
and she was a cold
and distant woman

208
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:13,814
who blamed the world
for her club foot.

209
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:15,250
Sweetie. And I...

210
00:09:15,293 --> 00:09:16,468
Wrap it up.

211
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:18,470
Sorry.

212
00:09:18,514 --> 00:09:20,690
My gratitude knows no bounds.

213
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:22,997
Thank you. Georgie?

214
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,130
Um, I'm thankful for my job

215
00:09:26,174 --> 00:09:27,915
at the auto shop.

216
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,700
Let's see...

217
00:09:30,744 --> 00:09:33,094
Alyssa Milano
from Who's the Boss?

218
00:09:33,137 --> 00:09:37,272
She's really hot.
That's about it.

219
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:40,057
That's wonderful. Shelly?

220
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:42,103
I'm sorry, Mom, but if
I answer that question,

221
00:09:42,146 --> 00:09:44,366
I'd be violating
my experimental protocol.

222
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:47,369
Okay, moving on. George?

223
00:09:47,412 --> 00:09:48,762
Well...

224
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:50,502
I'm thankful to share
Thanksgiving dinner

225
00:09:50,546 --> 00:09:52,548
with my family, of course.

226
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,724
I'm also thankful
for this fine country we live in

227
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:57,161
and all the opportunities
it provides us.

228
00:09:57,205 --> 00:09:58,859
Especially when
those opportunities

229
00:09:58,902 --> 00:10:01,775
come once in a lifetime
and require taking a small risk

230
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:04,168
and believing in one another.

231
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:06,693
We're really gonna do this now?

232
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:09,957
Hey, you started it with
all that school system crap.

233
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,350
I only did that
because you've been

234
00:10:12,394 --> 00:10:14,178
trying to twist
the kids' heads around.

235
00:10:14,222 --> 00:10:16,006
All right, who talked?

236
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,095
Who do you think? Missy.

237
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:19,531
Yup.

238
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:22,186
Well, it doesn't matter
because you obviously

239
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,711
went to your mother and made her
your stalking horse.

240
00:10:24,754 --> 00:10:26,147
Of course she went to me.

241
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,889
Move to Oklahoma,
what's wrong with you?

242
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:30,542
Wait, we're moving to Oklahoma?

243
00:10:30,586 --> 00:10:32,936
I thought Texans
don't like Oklahoma.

244
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,329
You're damn right we don't.

245
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:36,252
What's wrong with Oklahoma?
I'll tell you later.

246
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:38,681
Okay, that's enough of this.
Nobody's moving anywhere.

247
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:41,249
Let's just have
a nice, quiet dinner.

248
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:44,731
That's it? Y-You're gonna
make the decision for me?

249
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:46,341
I'm making a decision for us.

250
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:48,343
All right, then.

251
00:10:48,386 --> 00:10:49,692
Where are you going?

252
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:51,085
George.

253
00:10:51,128 --> 00:10:52,347
George!

254
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:02,836
As we sat in silence,

255
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,055
I had a horrible realization.

256
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:06,970
For the first time in my life,

257
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:10,408
I didn't look forward
to doing my homework.

258
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:22,203
Just watch the TV.

259
00:11:26,294 --> 00:11:28,339
Second down, nine...

260
00:11:37,392 --> 00:11:39,960
Difficult day.

261
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:41,352
Yes.

262
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:45,226
Psychology? Is that a
new interest of yours?

263
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:48,229
It was either this
or milking cows.

264
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:51,362
I once was licked by a cow.

265
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:52,799
You made the right choice.

266
00:11:52,842 --> 00:11:54,278
I'm not so sure.

267
00:11:54,322 --> 00:11:55,889
Why is that?

268
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:59,240
Well, I was supposed
to observe family dynamics

269
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:01,721
over Thanksgiving
for my hypothesis,

270
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:02,765
then make a prediction.

271
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:05,812
All right.

272
00:12:05,855 --> 00:12:08,249
So, um, what did you observe?

273
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:11,382
My mom and dad arguing
over moving to Oklahoma

274
00:12:11,426 --> 00:12:12,557
for my dad's job.

275
00:12:12,601 --> 00:12:15,343
I would concur with
that observation.

276
00:12:15,386 --> 00:12:19,173
Now, can you form a
hypothesis based on that?

277
00:12:19,216 --> 00:12:23,090
Well, their marriage
is a zero sum game.

278
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:24,439
What's good for my father

279
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:26,354
isn't good for my mother
and vice versa.

280
00:12:26,397 --> 00:12:27,355
Excellent.

281
00:12:27,398 --> 00:12:29,009
And your prediction?

282
00:12:29,052 --> 00:12:31,272
Well, based on
previous arguments

283
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:33,317
I've observed,
my father will try

284
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:34,928
to reassert his dominance

285
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:37,365
by making a meaningless
symbolic gesture.

286
00:12:37,408 --> 00:12:40,237
Really? That seems
a bit of a stretch.

287
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:57,254
I will never question you again.

288
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:03,783
Are you insane?

289
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:05,523
We can't afford a Ferrari.

290
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:07,090
It's a Fiero.

291
00:13:07,134 --> 00:13:08,570
Ferrari, Fiero, same thing.

292
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:10,137
Not really.

293
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,984
Now, do you mind?
I'm trying to watch the game.

294
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:13,333
Everybody's going to Meemaw's.
Come on.

295
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:14,706
Leave that tin can...

296
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,925
It's not like we haven't

297
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:17,840
heard them fight before. Just keep moving.

298
00:13:17,884 --> 00:13:20,887
Are we sleeping there?
Do I need to bring pajamas?

299
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,497
Just sleep in your underwear.

300
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,933
In my underwear?

301
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:25,326
I hardly think so.

302
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:27,328
Wait, I forgot something.

303
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:28,479
Just so you know, you're
sleeping out here tonight.

304
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:30,853
Perfect, then I won't
have to move.

305
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:34,117
I just want to thank you
for a lovely dinner.

306
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:12,373
Good.

307
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,765
Come on!

308
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,993
You kids excited
to go back to school?

309
00:14:24,037 --> 00:14:25,342
Of course I am.

310
00:14:25,386 --> 00:14:26,822
He doesn't speak for me.

311
00:14:28,258 --> 00:14:29,390
What are you doing?

312
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:30,434
Having coffee.

313
00:14:30,478 --> 00:14:32,306
No, not in my house.

314
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:34,351
Come on,
the best part of waking up

315
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:35,265
is Folgers in your cup.

316
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:36,745
Put it down.

317
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:39,487
I can't drink coffee,

318
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,793
I can't chew tobacco,
is there anything I can do?

319
00:14:41,837 --> 00:14:43,317
Yeah, quit talking.

320
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,927
Where's Dad?

321
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:47,712
He went to Oklahoma
for that job interview.

322
00:14:47,756 --> 00:14:49,540
I thought you put your
foot down on that one.

323
00:14:49,584 --> 00:14:51,499
Just keep eating your breakfast.

324
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:53,370
You really think
we might move there?

325
00:14:55,372 --> 00:14:58,158
I don't know what to think.

326
00:15:01,683 --> 00:15:03,206
Spending
the Thanksgiving weekend

327
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,991
working in my family's
convenience store,

328
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:07,471
I observed my father
and mother working

329
00:15:07,515 --> 00:15:10,126
from 600 in the morning
till 1000 at night.

330
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,607
My hypothesis was that
economic advancement

331
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,697
for immigrant families is more
important than celebrating

332
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,917
a holiday where people eat
until they pass out

333
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,744
in front of the TV.

334
00:15:19,788 --> 00:15:21,181
All right, Tam.

335
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:23,618
Well, based on your
observations and hypothesis,

336
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:25,359
were you able to
make a prediction?

337
00:15:25,402 --> 00:15:28,666
Yes. At some point,
my father would die

338
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,494
prematurely from stress.

339
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:32,322
And my mother
will come live with me,

340
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:33,889
where she will
constantly disapprove

341
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,719
of my hot, blonde,
American wife.

342
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:44,117
Okay. I think we all
learned something there.

343
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,379
Thank you, Tam.

344
00:15:45,422 --> 00:15:47,337
Mr. Cooper, you're up.

345
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:56,042
Beginning on Wednesday night,
I observed my parents

346
00:15:56,085 --> 00:15:59,697
arguing over the possibility
of us moving to Tulsa, Oklahoma.

347
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:02,135
Oklahoma.

348
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:04,441
The argument escalated
and then my father stormed out

349
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:08,097
and bought a Fiero.

350
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:09,751
And then I went to my Meemaw's

351
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:11,535
and slept in my underwear!

352
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:18,412
That's it; I've wasted my life.

353
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,505
You want to tell
me what happened?

354
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:26,463
Instead of remaining
a neutral observer,

355
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:29,379
I got emotional in front
of the whole class.

356
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:30,487
Well, that's not a big deal.

357
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:32,861
Yes, it is; I'm a scientist.

358
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:35,385
You never hear about Newton
crying like a baby

359
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:37,474
when he got brutalized
by an apple.

360
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:39,563
I think you're being
a little tough on yourself.

361
00:16:39,607 --> 00:16:43,437
I wonder why this
is affecting me so much.

362
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,875
Well, maybe it has something
to do with your parents arguing.

363
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:49,530
Us moving? I don't think so.

364
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:52,098
Texas, Oklahoma...
what's the difference?

365
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:54,622
Hey, now, I think you
might want to crack open

366
00:16:54,665 --> 00:16:58,582
your psychology textbook
'cause that there is crazy talk.

367
00:16:58,626 --> 00:17:02,238
I did read a chapter
on repressing emotions.

368
00:17:02,282 --> 00:17:04,980
I suppose I could've been
doing that to avoid dealing

369
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,634
with the fear of change,

370
00:17:06,677 --> 00:17:09,550
and moving would certainly
be a big change.

371
00:17:09,593 --> 00:17:12,074
That's very astute. I'd have a new room,

372
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:14,033
in a new house,

373
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:16,600
and the new house would probably
have a different smell,

374
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:18,428
and I probably
wouldn't like that smell

375
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:20,213
because I don't like new smells,

376
00:17:20,256 --> 00:17:23,390
and I'd be going to a new school
with new kids and new teachers,

377
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:25,150
and I bet they'd all
smell different, as well.

378
00:17:25,174 --> 00:17:26,480
Okay, now calm down.

379
00:17:26,523 --> 00:17:27,916
That's easy for you to say.

380
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,527
Your olfactory senses
aren't about to be assaulted

381
00:17:30,571 --> 00:17:31,963
by the state of Oklahoma.

382
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:34,053
Okay, let's try
a different approach.

383
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:36,664
Can I take you
to get some ice cream?

384
00:17:36,707 --> 00:17:39,493
I'm having an emotional
crisis, Meemaw!

385
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:41,495
You can't fix that
with ice cream.

386
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:44,106
Right. Sorry.

387
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:48,502
You want to go to Radio Shack?

388
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:51,157
Yes, I want to go
to Radio Shack!

389
00:17:55,378 --> 00:17:58,686
Well, sir, that's the tour.

390
00:17:58,729 --> 00:18:01,732
What do you think,
nicer than East Texas?

391
00:18:01,776 --> 00:18:03,560
Very impressive.

392
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:05,171
Not sure how you did it,

393
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:07,912
but that is the least disgusting
locker room I've ever been in.

394
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:09,000
Yes, sir.

395
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:10,741
Every bit of it's
brand, spanking new.

396
00:18:10,785 --> 00:18:13,396
I bet if you had to, you could
even eat lunch in there.

397
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,486
So what do you say, George?

398
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,575
I could sure use a man
with your track record

399
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:21,187
to coach special teams. Please.

400
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:25,234
Thank you. I got to say,
I'm real tempted.

401
00:18:25,278 --> 00:18:27,323
How does the family feel
about relocating?

402
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:31,371
They're all pretty excited
about the opportunity.

403
00:18:31,414 --> 00:18:34,113
The kids see it as an adventure.

404
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:38,465
So why am I feeling like
you got some hesitation?

405
00:18:38,508 --> 00:18:39,727
If it's about the money,

406
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,555
I believe I can get you
some more money.

407
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:44,427
No, no, no, the money's good.

408
00:18:44,471 --> 00:18:46,603
Well, that's it, then.
You're gonna fit in perfectly

409
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:47,996
with our program here.

410
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:50,017
We got a lovely little house
for you and your family,

411
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,304
and best of all,

412
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:53,610
you're gonna be out of Texas.

413
00:18:53,654 --> 00:18:55,960
I thought you started out
in Houston?

414
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:59,660
Shh. I'm trying
to fit in around here.

415
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,621
So we have a deal?

416
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:31,648
What happened?

417
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:36,479
Can I take my coat off?

418
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:37,828
No. What happened?

419
00:19:37,872 --> 00:19:40,875
I turned it down.

420
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:41,963
Why?

421
00:19:42,006 --> 00:19:44,139
'Cause you're afraid of Mom?

422
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,620
'Cause I don't want to live
in Oklahoma.

423
00:19:46,663 --> 00:19:47,708
George.

424
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:49,797
What difference
does it make, Mare?

425
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,840
We're not moving.

426
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:55,846
As a child, I never understood

427
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,198
the sacrifices my father made
for his family's happiness,

428
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:01,461
which made me somewhat
less compassionate

429
00:20:01,504 --> 00:20:02,505
than I should've been.

430
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:04,203
Yay! We're not moving!

431
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:05,943
We're staying in Texas!

432
00:20:15,431 --> 00:20:19,305
John? Yes?

433
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:23,961
Could we do it
just one more time?

434
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:27,182
Really? I don't want you
to get tired of it.

435
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:31,926
I won't. Please?

436
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:34,537
Well, I can't say no to you.

437
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:39,586
Fire in the hole.

438
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:43,807
Unbelievable.

439
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,072
Again, again.

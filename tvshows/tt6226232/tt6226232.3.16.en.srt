1
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,216
<i>In the early days
of the Internet,</i>

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,803
<i>you couldn't stream movies
or summon Thai food to your doorstep.</i>

3
00:00:10,887 --> 00:00:16,351
<i>But if you were interested in text-based
news about upcoming physics lectures,</i>

4
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:18,186
<i>it was a great time to be alive.</i>

5
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:19,562
Holy moly.

6
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:25,652
Dad.

7
00:00:26,277 --> 00:00:28,154
- Dad!
- I'm in the shower!

8
00:00:28,238 --> 00:00:32,033
- It's an emergency.
- Fine! Come in.

9
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:34,869
Dad?

10
00:00:34,953 --> 00:00:36,955
I thought you had to use the bathroom.

11
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:39,165
At 7:23 in the morning?

12
00:00:39,249 --> 00:00:41,501
Why do I print schedules
if you're not gonna read them?

13
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:44,295
- Tell me what you want.
- What are we doing next weekend?

14
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:46,381
This ain't sounding like an emergency.

15
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:50,927
It is. Stephen Hawking is giving a lecture,
and I really need to go.

16
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,097
Can we talk when I'm out of the shower?

17
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,138
Pick up the pace.

18
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:59,561
According to the schedule you don't read,
I'm due in there in six minutes.

19
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:04,148
<i>♪ Nobody else is stronger than I am ♪</i>

20
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:06,943
<i>♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪</i>

21
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:09,904
<i>♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪</i>

22
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:12,615
<i>♪ I am a mighty little man ♪</i>

23
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:16,619
<i>♪ I am a mighty little man ♪</i>

24
00:01:18,955 --> 00:01:19,955
So can we go?

25
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,167
I don't know. Take a shower.

26
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:26,296
I still have two minutes and 15 seconds.
Let's nail this down.

27
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:29,716
Where's the lecture?

28
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,551
If the answer's Dallas, we're not going.

29
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:33,720
- Good news: it's not Dallas.
- Where?

30
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:35,430
Pasadena, California.

31
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:38,433
California?
That's a lot further than Dallas.

32
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:41,311
1,232 miles further as the crow flies.

33
00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:43,521
But kudos to you for being up
on your geography.

34
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:46,566
There's no way we're going to California.

35
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,819
If Stephen Hawking can make it
in a wheelchair, I'm sure we can manage.

36
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:52,405
Sheldon, airplane tickets are expensive.

37
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:54,782
Hotels are expensive. We can't afford it.

38
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:56,826
But his health is fragile.

39
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,746
This might be my only chance
to ever see him in person.

40
00:02:01,706 --> 00:02:03,291
I'm sorry, buddy.

41
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:08,129
I would like to discuss this further,
but I only have 22 seconds

42
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:10,965
to be in the shower,
and buttons slow me down.

43
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:17,847
This is the moment we lost that game.

44
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,434
But one bad play
doesn't mean you give up.

45
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:25,813
We had plenty of time to turn it around,
but y'all decided it was over.

46
00:02:25,897 --> 00:02:28,900
I don't want to ever
see that happen again.

47
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:33,196
Next time something seems
out of your reach, you do not quit.

48
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:35,031
You just dig deeper.

49
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:38,743
Does that mean if I find an affordable flight
to California, we can go?

50
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:46,668
Hi. Can I help you?

51
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:49,045
I'm trying to find the cheapest flight
to California

52
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:52,590
- for me and my father.
- Okay. Well, have a seat.

53
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:54,676
You looking to go to Disneyland?

54
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:57,804
The only ride I'm interested in
is the intellectual roller coaster

55
00:02:57,887 --> 00:02:59,639
of Stephen Hawking's mind.

56
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:02,558
And where is that located?

57
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:04,769
Well, Stephen Hawking's head.

58
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,813
But that will be at Caltech in Pasadena.

59
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:08,439
Got it.

60
00:03:08,523 --> 00:03:10,316
When, uh, were you looking to fly?

61
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,152
- Next weekend.
- Oh, wow, that's pretty soon.

62
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:14,779
Traveling last-minute can be pricey.

63
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,781
Are there discounts available?

64
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,033
Are you a member of any
frequent-flier programs?

65
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:21,035
No, I've never flown before.

66
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:26,165
Well, ways to keep the cost down are:
flying on weekdays, multiple layovers,

67
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:29,419
or this probably doesn't apply,
but airlines offer special fares

68
00:03:29,502 --> 00:03:31,796
if there's been a death in the family.

69
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,798
Interesting. May I use your phone?

70
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:38,094
Hello?

71
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:40,346
- What else you got?
<i>- Hello?</i>

72
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:42,890
- See you.
- Where you going?

73
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:44,016
Out with Jana.

74
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,436
You've been spending a lot of time
with her lately.

75
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:48,312
Is she your girlfriend?

76
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:50,064
Dad, can you make her stop?

77
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:52,400
I could but I won't. Also, I can't.

78
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:54,610
I just want to know
what's going on in your life.

79
00:03:54,694 --> 00:03:58,489
If this girl is someone special to you,
then she's special to me.

80
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:00,992
- Come on.
- Mary, enough.

81
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:02,910
- What? I want to know.
- Bye.

82
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:04,537
If it helps, I don't care.

83
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,081
It does. Thank you.

84
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:09,208
Why doesn't he tell me anything?

85
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:11,711
When you were a teenager,
did you tell your parents stuff?

86
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:14,547
- Well, no.
- Then why do you expect him to?

87
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,549
Because I'm a cool, fun mom.

88
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:21,137
Dad, good news.

89
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,307
Airline tickets to California
are more affordable than you think.

90
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,934
- We're not going.
- What's all this about?

91
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:29,312
Stephen Hawking is giving
a lecture at Caltech.

92
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:32,231
If we leave on Wednesday and are willing
to make four layovers,

93
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:36,444
in Boise, Denver, Albuquerque, and Fargo,
we can get there for only $95 each.

94
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:39,947
I have a job. I can't just leave
in the middle of the week.

95
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:41,157
Well, then what about Mom?

96
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,118
Sorry, Shelly, we're not
in a position to do this.

97
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:46,370
But Stephen Hawking's my hero.

98
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:48,331
Imagine if you got a chance to see Jesus

99
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:51,125
or Dad got to meet the man
who invented beer.

100
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:58,925
Someone's Underoos are in a knot.

101
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:01,385
My Underoos are fitting just fine,
thank you.

102
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:03,346
Then why is there a stick up your butt?

103
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:06,724
- Stop making inquiries about my bottom.
- But I enjoy it.

104
00:05:06,808 --> 00:05:10,520
Mom and Dad won't take me to California
to see Stephen Hawking.

105
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:12,855
You thought they would take you
to California?

106
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:13,897
Yes.

107
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:16,108
They wouldn't even buy me this book
at the book fair.

108
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:19,821
I had to get it at the library.
There's a booger on one of the pages.

109
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:22,740
Well, I may never get another chance
to see him in person.

110
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:25,076
Suck it up.
You always get everything you want.

111
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:26,536
That's not true.

112
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:28,746
You got a computer.

113
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,873
- I'm reading a booger book.
- Fine.

114
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:32,583
How do you recommend I "suck it up"?

115
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:35,753
I don't know, when you don't get your way,
shut up and move on.

116
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:37,964
- Is that what you do?
- Yeah.

117
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:39,841
And that's why
you don't have a computer.

118
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

119
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:54,522
Georgie is my son. I have the right
to know who he's spending time with.

120
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,107
You talking about Jana?

121
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,318
- You know her?
- Well, I don't really know her.

122
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:02,947
I've seen them hanging out together
at Dale's store a couple of times.

123
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,241
- She's cute.
- Great.

124
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:07,118
So you know more than I do.

125
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,036
Always have.

126
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:14,333
I don't feel I'm being
out of line wanting to...

127
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:19,463
know how old this girl is, or what church
she goes to, or her last name.

128
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:20,547
Owens.

129
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,926
What? Now you know.

130
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:27,930
- Unbelievable.
- Oh, jeez.

131
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:31,767
You worry about Sheldon not being normal,
now about Georgie being normal.

132
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:33,436
How did I raise such a turd?

133
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,564
I am not that word.

134
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:41,402
If you can't say the word,
you might be the word.

135
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:42,861
Hm.

136
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,619
<i>Over the next few days,
I tried to take my sister's advice</i>

137
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:50,953
<i>and "suck it up."</i>

138
00:06:51,037 --> 00:06:54,916
<i>But how could I, when everything
reminded me of Stephen Hawking?</i>

139
00:07:02,924 --> 00:07:06,385
<i>L-E-A-R-N.</i>

140
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:07,637
<i>That is correct.</i>

141
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,972
<i>- Now spell...</i>
- Oh, dear!

142
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:19,357
It's actually a shampoo for ladies,
but my hair just responds to it.

143
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:25,571
- <i>So what are you doing Friday night?
- No plans.</i>

144
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:27,573
<i>My parents are gonna be out of town.</i>

145
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:29,783
Really?

146
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:31,661
Wanna come over?

147
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:37,708
My parents won't let me
if your folks ain't there.

148
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:38,793
<i>Okay.</i>

149
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:42,463
But I guess I don't have to tell them.

150
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:44,924
<i>Cool.</i>

151
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:47,093
Okay, that's it.

152
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:49,845
<i>Nothing was able
to shake me from my doldrums,</i>

153
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:52,848
<i>not even Dr. Sturgis'
jaunty new sweater-vest.</i>

154
00:07:52,932 --> 00:07:55,601
- Sheldon?
- Yes?

155
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:58,354
You seem distracted.

156
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:01,565
I wanted to see Stephen Hawking
speak at Caltech,

157
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:03,651
but my parents can't afford the trip.

158
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,695
That's too bad.

159
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:07,989
Dr. H puts on a heck of a show.

160
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:09,532
I believe it.

161
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:14,412
Would it make you feel better
to know this vest is reversible?

162
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,956
- A little. Thanks.
- Wait.

163
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,209
I may be able to help you with Hawking.

164
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:23,462
- Really?
- This vest is not the only thing

165
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:25,464
that's full of surprises.

166
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:31,679
- Where you going?
- Out.

167
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:33,014
Out where?

168
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:35,057
Jana's.

169
00:08:35,141 --> 00:08:37,101
- Her parents gonna be there?
- Yep.

170
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,729
Okay. Let me just call and make sure.

171
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:42,440
Owens.

172
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,525
Owens.

173
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:45,985
That's her last name, right?

174
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:48,529
Why are you being so weird?

175
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:50,990
I'm not being weird. Are you?

176
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:54,160
- No.
- Good. No one's being weird.

177
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:56,620
- Don't call them.
- Why not?

178
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,289
Why can't you trust me?

179
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,378
Because I know that you're lying.

180
00:09:04,462 --> 00:09:08,549
- What? No, I'm not.
- I heard you on the phone with Jana.

181
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:09,717
You spied on me?

182
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,095
I didn't mean to, but I'm glad that I did,
because you just lied to my face.

183
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:14,805
You're not going anywhere.

184
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,058
Try and stop me.

185
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:20,019
You walk out that door,
and your father gets involved.

186
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,317
I don't need this.

187
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:32,615
Dang.

188
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:37,578
Dad.

189
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,955
- You missed everything.
- What happened?

190
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:42,249
Georgie lied to Mom
to be alone at Jana's house,

191
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,460
but Mom knew because she listened in
on his call.

192
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:45,961
Oh, boy.

193
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:47,713
Now he's grounded and everyone's mad.

194
00:09:47,797 --> 00:09:49,465
Not me. I'm super happy.

195
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:52,384
Well, bye.

196
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:55,721
Dad, the university offered to pay for us
to go to California!

197
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:58,974
- They're putting us up in a hotel.
- You're kidding.

198
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:01,769
- We're going to California?
- No, just me and Dad.

199
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:06,816
That's fair. I'm so happy for you.

200
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:11,946
<i>Sometimes sarcasm
was laid on so thick even I could detect it.</i>

201
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,489
Thanks!

202
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:16,534
<i>This was not one of those times.</i>

203
00:10:17,827 --> 00:10:20,871
I see. Well, no, that makes sense.

204
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:23,332
Okay, John, thanks.

205
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:24,959
Bye.

206
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:27,837
Sheldon was right.

207
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,714
- They're offering to pay for the whole trip.
- Why?

208
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:32,091
Sturgis talked to his boss,

209
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:34,969
and they really want
to keep Sheldon going to school there.

210
00:10:36,095 --> 00:10:37,513
I guess I could take him.

211
00:10:38,848 --> 00:10:40,683
Why you? He asked me first.

212
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,229
I'm mad at Georgie right now.
It'd be good for us to have some space.

213
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,816
So, you pick a fight with Georgie,
and I don't get to go to California?

214
00:10:51,152 --> 00:10:52,570
Fine, you can go.

215
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,196
Thank you.

216
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:58,742
Have fun managing Sheldon's bathroom
schedule in different time zones.

217
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:12,464
Let me get a picture of my boys
before their big trip.

218
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:14,258
It's smart to document this.

219
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:18,304
Next time you see me, I'll have been
in the presence of Stephen Hawking.

220
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:21,056
- Smile.
- I'd prefer to look serious.

221
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,517
This may appear in a textbook someday.

222
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:26,854
- Say, "Stephen Hawking."
- Stephen Hawking.

223
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:30,232
Aw, you made me smile.

224
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:38,032
Wash up for dinner.

225
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:41,243
- I ain't eating.
- Well, you're not watching TV.

226
00:11:41,327 --> 00:11:43,871
I can't leave the house,
and now I can't watch TV.

227
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,582
Yeah, it's called being grounded.

228
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,754
I can't wait to move out.

229
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:52,922
What was that?

230
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:56,759
Next time, I'll say it on the phone
so you can hear me.

231
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:05,976
You keep frowning like that, you're gonna
get wrinkles like your Meemaw.

232
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,269
You look great.

233
00:12:07,353 --> 00:12:10,522
I know, I just wanted to hear you say it.

234
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,152
What's on your mind?

235
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:17,655
Sheldon always gets everything he wants.

236
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,407
I guess he does.

237
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:21,951
That's not fair, huh?

238
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:23,244
No!

239
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:27,831
On the other hand, he's just going
to some science lecture.

240
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:31,627
I know, but he gets to go on a plane
to California.

241
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,045
Planes aren't all that great.

242
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,673
You can't even smoke on them anymore.

243
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:40,678
I tell you what, after practice today,
you and me will do something fun.

244
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:43,138
- Can I have my first cigarette?
- No!

245
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,641
Can I get my ears pierced?

246
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:48,227
Your mom won't like that.

247
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,271
So maybe.

248
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:02,574
All right, 34-A and B this is us.

249
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:04,618
All right, you want the aisle or the window?

250
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:06,078
Which one is assigned to me?

251
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:07,913
It doesn't matter, just pick one.

252
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:10,916
Well, if I sit by the window,
I can watch the takeoff and landing,

253
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,669
but if I sit on the aisle,
I'm closer to the bathroom.

254
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:14,837
Here we go.

255
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,132
Although if I'm by the window, you'll have
to get up when I use the bathroom.

256
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:21,218
But if I'm not, I'll have to get up
when you use the bathroom.

257
00:13:21,302 --> 00:13:23,637
- Just pick one.
- It's a tricky decision.

258
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:27,391
- My bladder's smaller than yours...
- Everything okay here?

259
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,310
- About to be. Here!
- Agh!

260
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:31,478
Aisle it is! We're good.

261
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:33,105
Oh, okay.

262
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:40,321
- You want to help me with this?
- No.

263
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:41,697
Hey!

264
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,532
You're the one who lied to me.

265
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:47,411
Well, I'm done talking to you,
so it'll never happen again.

266
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:52,875
What?

267
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,794
I know you don't want to talk,
and that's fine. You can just listen.

268
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:01,467
Life is hard enough
if you make good decisions,

269
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,595
but if you make bad ones,
it gets even harder.

270
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,972
Nothing was gonna happen with Jana.

271
00:14:07,056 --> 00:14:10,017
- Georgie...
- No! You always assume the worst with me.

272
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,978
I'm sorry you were a perfect kid
and I'm just a screwup.

273
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:15,689
You are not a screwup.

274
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:19,109
And I was not a perfect kid.

275
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:21,904
Oh, what'd you do,
sleep through church one morning?

276
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:25,949
For your information...

277
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:30,579
I used to skip class so that I could...

278
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,792
drink beer in my boyfriend's truck.

279
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:37,961
Dad had a truck back then?

280
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,464
Not talking about your dad.

281
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:42,299
Whoa.

282
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,888
I also...

283
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:52,017
stole your Meemaw's car
and crashed it into a ditch.

284
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:54,520
Really? With that boyfriend
who wasn't Dad?

285
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:55,854
Missing the point!

286
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:58,857
If the point is you made some
bad decisions and turned out fine,

287
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:00,401
then why you being so hard on me?

288
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:04,154
Because some decisions
you cannot walk away from

289
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:06,573
and they will affect the rest of your life.

290
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:09,284
If you're talking about Jana
getting pregnant, she ain't gonna.

291
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:11,870
That is what I thought,
and the next thing I know,

292
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:14,123
I'm at the courthouse getting married.

293
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,043
You got married
because you were pregnant?

294
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,173
Yes.

295
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:29,346
- So, I was a mistake?
- No! No! Ugh...

296
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,723
You are a blessing.

297
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:35,602
The mistake was lying to my parents,

298
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:39,481
so that I could spend the night
at your dad's house.

299
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:41,692
And, you know, tequila.

300
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,153
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.</i>

301
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:46,530
<i>We're expecting a smooth flight
to Los Angeles.</i>

302
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,907
<i>Before we take off,
please direct your attention</i>

303
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:52,578
<i>to the flight attendants as they review
some important safety procedures.</i>

304
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:55,873
"Safety procedures"? Oh, baby.

305
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:59,042
Take a minute to locate the exit
closest to you.

306
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:01,670
The nearest exit could be behind you.

307
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:04,256
Should the cabin experience
sudden pressure loss,

308
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:07,092
oxygen masks will drop down
from above your seat.

309
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:09,178
Why would the cabin lose pressure?

310
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:12,514
- It won't.
- ...over your mouth and nose like this,

311
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:14,975
pull the strap to tighten it.

312
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,768
If you are traveling with children,

313
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:20,939
make sure that your own mask is on first
before helping your child.

314
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:24,860
- I don't like this at all.
- It's just a precaution, you know.

315
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,195
Perfectly safe.

316
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:29,948
In the unlikely event of a water landing
and evacuation...

317
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:33,494
<i>Water landing, water landing,
water landing...</i>

318
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:34,577
I can't do this.

319
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,793
Keep going, we'll be right back.

320
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:43,045
Uh, sir?

321
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:45,514
- Sheldon, come out of there!
- No!

322
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,716
At least open the door.

323
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:50,969
Tell them I need to get off.

324
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,223
Sir? You both need
to return to your seats.

325
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:56,141
Just one second.

326
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:57,225
Sir.

327
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,606
If you want to see Stephen Hawking,
we have to sit down right now.

328
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,566
It's too dangerous. I can't!

329
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:08,529
It's okay to be scared. That's when
you got to dig deep and be brave.

330
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:11,740
- What do you say?
- No! I'm your terrified little boy!

331
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:13,075
Okay.

332
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:16,119
- Sir, please, they're gonna call security.
- Just one more second.

333
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:20,040
Mr. Spock!

334
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,668
He flies around all the time
in that spaceship.

335
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:25,629
- He's not afraid, is he?
- I'm not Mr. Spock.

336
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:28,966
No, but I've seen you pretend to be him.

337
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:34,054
Could you do that right now?
You be Spock, I'll be Kirk.

338
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,017
Maybe.

339
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,396
Okay, Mr. Spock.

340
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:45,524
Your first order is to return to your seat.

341
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:48,610
Aye, captain.

342
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:54,032
<i>Flight attendants,
prepare for takeoff.</i>

343
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:59,371
You okay, Mr. Spock?

344
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:01,498
Doing my best, sir.

345
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:08,589
The captain and Mr. Spock
don't hold hands.

346
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:10,674
Sorry.

347
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:21,893
Okay, maybe just this once.

348
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,667
I think we've been lied to about California.

349
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:47,753
No one on this campus is tan at all.

350
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,673
No, they are not.

351
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:58,555
Imagine all the stimulating conversations
that must go on at these tables.

352
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:00,015
I bet.

353
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:04,519
I can see myself going here one day.

354
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:07,481
I think you'd fit right in.

355
00:19:08,305 --> 00:20:08,558

1
00:00:04,482 --> 00:00:06,658
A fossil is formed

2
00:00:06,702 --> 00:00:08,617
when an organism,
preserved in sediment,

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,053
undergoes physical compression

4
00:00:10,097 --> 00:00:11,750
over millions of years.

5
00:00:11,794 --> 00:00:14,449
Less than one
ten-thousandth percent

6
00:00:14,492 --> 00:00:15,861
of living organisms
will become fossils.

7
00:00:15,885 --> 00:00:18,235
Isn't it amazing

8
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:21,456
that something so fragile
can defy those odds,

9
00:00:21,499 --> 00:00:23,501
only to have this
happen to it...

10
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:27,027
I don't think
you did that right.

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,290
 All right, everyone,

12
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,770
we'll pick it up here tomorrow.
I-If we're lucky,

13
00:00:31,814 --> 00:00:34,599
we may find a fossil as old
as lunch lady Phyllis.

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,864
You people don't know
what's funny.

15
00:00:38,908 --> 00:00:41,041
Cooper!

16
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:45,436
Will you put these away for me?

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,308
Sure.

18
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:49,310
You better watch yourself.

19
00:00:49,353 --> 00:00:51,399
I will, I-I really will.

20
00:00:51,442 --> 00:00:53,362
'Cause you know what's
gonna happen if you don't.

21
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:00,495
Who was that?

22
00:01:00,538 --> 00:01:01,800
No one.

23
00:01:01,844 --> 00:01:03,672
Why did he push you?

24
00:01:03,715 --> 00:01:05,108
None of your business.

25
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:07,067
But that was a clear violation

26
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,633
of the student code of conduct.

27
00:01:08,677 --> 00:01:10,026
We need to tell on him.

28
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,507
We're not telling on anyone,
stay out of it.

29
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:13,832
But the student code
of conduct...

30
00:01:13,856 --> 00:01:16,163
Drop it.

31
00:01:16,206 --> 00:01:18,904
So I did drop it...

32
00:01:20,732 --> 00:01:22,125
for six whole minutes.

33
00:01:22,169 --> 00:01:23,692
Excuse me, sir.

34
00:01:23,735 --> 00:01:25,824
When you're done urinating,
I'd like to ask you

35
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:29,306
some questions about
social dynamics, intimidation,

36
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,134
threats, et cetera.

37
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,617
Finish up, no hurry.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

39
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,246
What is your problem?

40
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,813
I don't have a problem.

41
00:01:57,856 --> 00:02:00,163
You should probably
wash your hands.

42
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:04,167
I just witnessed an altercation

43
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:05,908
between you and Georgie Cooper.

44
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:07,388
Altercation?

45
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:10,217
A confrontation,
a tussle. Anyway,

46
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,088
I'd just like to gather
more information

47
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,003
for sociological purposes.

48
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:17,920
I heard about you,
you're that smart kid.

49
00:02:17,963 --> 00:02:21,402
I'd like to be humble in this
moment, but yes, that's me.

50
00:02:21,445 --> 00:02:23,230
Sheldon Cooper, at your service.

51
00:02:23,273 --> 00:02:27,016
So Georgie's your brother? Correct.

52
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:29,192
And you're trying
to protect him?

53
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:33,196
Incorrect. I'm just curious
what he did to incur your wrath.

54
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,111
Also, kudos on the hand washing.

55
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,244
Your brother's a punk.

56
00:02:37,287 --> 00:02:39,855
I'm not familiar
with that terminology.

57
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:42,118
He tried to hit on
my girlfriend.

58
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,643
Interesting. So he openly
pursued your mate,

59
00:02:45,687 --> 00:02:47,123
and to re-assert dominance,

60
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,212
you threatened him
with physical violence.

61
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:51,040
Hell yeah, I did.

62
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,650
I understand that.

63
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:55,653
I often intimidate people
with my intelligence.

64
00:03:00,441 --> 00:03:03,270
Well, one of us scared him.

65
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:07,361
 All right.

66
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:10,668
Next. Missy Cooper.

67
00:03:12,844 --> 00:03:15,456
Just a heads-up,
this is my good side.

68
00:03:15,499 --> 00:03:17,849
Okay...

69
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:20,635
Do your parents know
you're wearing that makeup?

70
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:22,376
Yeah, my mom knows.

71
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:26,293
You sure? Because typically
it's not allowed.

72
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,643
If you don't believe me,
you can ask her.

73
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:31,950
Okay, we're gonna
give her a call.

74
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:35,780
Really?

75
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:38,783
Good news, I just spoke
to Tommy Clarkson.

76
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:40,655
What? Are you crazy?

77
00:03:40,698 --> 00:03:42,265
Nope, Mom had me tested.

78
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:44,441
And Tommy's actually nicer
than you think.

79
00:03:44,485 --> 00:03:46,138
I told you to stay out of it.

80
00:03:46,182 --> 00:03:47,792
True, but what you
didn't tell me

81
00:03:47,836 --> 00:03:50,099
was that you were overly chummy
with his girlfriend,

82
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:51,970
which is why he wants
to kick your bottom.

83
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:54,234
I'm about to kick your bottom.

84
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:58,586
I don't think so.

85
00:03:58,629 --> 00:03:59,848
H-Hey, Tommy.

86
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:01,937
How you doing?

87
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,028
You got a problem with him,
you got a problem with me.

88
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:08,073
And just to make
his logic clear,

89
00:04:08,117 --> 00:04:09,814
you do have a problem with me.

90
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:11,642
Don't listen to my brother,
I don't have

91
00:04:11,686 --> 00:04:12,817
a problem with anybody.

92
00:04:12,861 --> 00:04:14,950
You need to apologize.

93
00:04:14,993 --> 00:04:16,473
I-I'm very sorry.

94
00:04:16,517 --> 00:04:17,953
To him.

95
00:04:17,996 --> 00:04:19,563
I'm very sorry, Sheldon.

96
00:04:22,697 --> 00:04:24,481
Later, kid.

97
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:27,876
See? He's nice.

98
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:41,542
What were you even thinking?

99
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:43,892
I was thinking I look hot.

100
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:46,068
You know you're not allowed
to wear makeup.

101
00:04:46,111 --> 00:04:47,765
That's why I didn't tell you.

102
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:50,377
And who gave it to you?
Heather B.? Heather M.?

103
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,943
Meemaw.

104
00:04:51,987 --> 00:04:54,511
So your grandmother was okay
with you looking like this

105
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:55,686
in your school pictures?

106
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,688
If you don't believe me,
ask her.

107
00:04:57,732 --> 00:04:59,864
I'm going to.

108
00:04:59,908 --> 00:05:02,737
Really?

109
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,260
These are the plaintiffs,

110
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,914
Valerie and Anthony Sines.

111
00:05:05,957 --> 00:05:08,133
Valerie claims she was
sitting on the front steps

112
00:05:08,177 --> 00:05:10,484
of her condo
with her cat Scampi,

113
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,704
and that's when his dog went
after Scampi, injuring her.

114
00:05:13,748 --> 00:05:16,490
What are you watching? Go away.

115
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:18,318
Are you angry with me?

116
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:20,145
I don't want to see
your face right now.

117
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:23,888
Very well, but I'd like
to watch Professor Proton.

118
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:25,890
Did you hear me? Go away.

119
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:27,849
Well, did you hear me?

120
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:29,764
I'd like to watch
Professor Proton.

121
00:05:29,807 --> 00:05:32,767
Too bad. Interesting.

122
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,943
I wonder how my new friend
Tommy Clarkson

123
00:05:34,986 --> 00:05:36,292
would feel about this.

124
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,946
Well, he's not here, is he?

125
00:05:37,989 --> 00:05:40,514
No, he's not.

126
00:05:40,557 --> 00:05:43,168
I guess I'll just
have to call him.

127
00:05:43,212 --> 00:05:44,779
You're kidding.

128
00:05:44,822 --> 00:05:46,694
The case of

129
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:48,391
a taste of Scampi

130
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:50,045
after these messages.

131
00:05:50,088 --> 00:05:52,613
Are you going to put on
Professor Proton?

132
00:05:52,656 --> 00:05:53,744
No.

133
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:06,453
Okay, okay.

134
00:06:07,758 --> 00:06:10,282
Thank you.

135
00:06:12,502 --> 00:06:15,113
I didn't hear
a "you're welcome."

136
00:06:15,157 --> 00:06:16,463
Shut up!

137
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:17,725
We'll work on that.

138
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:20,162
It's time for science!

139
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:22,338
Hello.

140
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,123
Well, don't you
look like Madonna?

141
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:26,429
Thank you.

142
00:06:26,473 --> 00:06:28,126
I was actually trying
to look like you.

143
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,911
Thank you.

144
00:06:29,954 --> 00:06:32,479
Why would you give her makeup
without talking to me first?

145
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:34,089
I didn't give her any makeup.

146
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:36,657
Well, then, one of you is lying.

147
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,658
She is.

148
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:39,486
Time to come clean little lady.

149
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:41,139
I ain't taking the hit
on this one.

150
00:06:41,183 --> 00:06:44,752
I took the makeup
from Meemaw's bag.

151
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:47,798
Missy, you are
in a world of trouble.

152
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:50,192
Calm down,
it's not that big a deal.

153
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:51,541
It is so a big deal!

154
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:54,109
She stole from you,
and then she lied about it.

155
00:06:54,152 --> 00:06:56,590
I know, but come on,
she's only ten.

156
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:59,593
She's gonna do way stupider
stuff when she's older.

157
00:06:59,636 --> 00:07:00,768
Guaranteed.

158
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:02,073
I don't care.

159
00:07:02,117 --> 00:07:04,424
She is my daughter
and you will be punished.

160
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:07,905
Sorry, kid.

161
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:10,386
I wish I was your daughter.

162
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:13,911
Is that so?

163
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,610
Well, guess what?

164
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:18,133
You're sleeping here tonight

165
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:20,440
because I don't feel like
being around either one of you.

166
00:07:21,832 --> 00:07:23,747
Great!

167
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,968
Yeah, great.

168
00:07:33,235 --> 00:07:35,759
Georgie, be a lamb
and get me a Yoo-hoo.

169
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:37,239
Get your own.

170
00:07:37,282 --> 00:07:40,242
Are you sure
you want to speak to me

171
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:41,765
in that tone of voice?

172
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:44,594
Sheldon, I'm getting
real tired of this.

173
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:47,162
That's too bad.
I'm enjoying it quite a bit.

174
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,121
Still waiting on that Yoo-hoo.

175
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:51,558
You think you're so tough now,

176
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:53,211
I swear, one day I'm... GEORGE SR. Hey.

177
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:54,386
What's going on?

178
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,779
Sheldon's being a jerk.

179
00:07:55,823 --> 00:07:57,128
That true?

180
00:07:57,172 --> 00:07:59,522
All I did was ask for a Yoo-hoo.

181
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:01,006
He's leaving out
the part where he...

182
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:05,615
Forget it.

183
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:08,139
Great. Done.

184
00:08:08,183 --> 00:08:09,619
Georgie,

185
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:13,188
at the risk
of repeating myself...

186
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:18,541
And one from the back,
so it's cold.

187
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:29,683
So when, exactly,
did you swipe my makeup?

188
00:08:29,726 --> 00:08:30,964
While you were
at bowling league.

189
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:32,903
You don't have a key
to this house.

190
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:33,904
How'd you get in?

191
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:34,992
Can't tell you that.

192
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:36,298
I might need to do it again.

193
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:38,779
Unbelievable.

194
00:08:38,822 --> 00:08:41,956
And for future reference,
go lighter on the blush,

195
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:44,132
or you'll end up looking
like Raggedy Ann.

196
00:08:44,175 --> 00:08:47,396
She got Raggedy Andy
looking like that.

197
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:50,225
He's her brother.

198
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:52,706
I've been playing
with those dolls all wrong.

199
00:08:52,749 --> 00:08:54,925
All right, that'll do it.

200
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:59,016
How old was Mom when
you let her wear makeup?

201
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,106
I don't know, I didn't really
have rules like that.

202
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,588
See? How come you're so cool
and she's such a dud?

203
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:07,416
Well, I wouldn't call her a dud.

204
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:08,678
What would you call her?

205
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:11,420
Point is, she wasn't
always like that.

206
00:09:11,463 --> 00:09:12,682
What was she like?

207
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:17,034
When she was a teenager,
she was just wild.

208
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:19,036
Really? Yeah.

209
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,908
She used to wait
until I went to sleep

210
00:09:20,951 --> 00:09:22,344
and then she would sneak out

211
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:24,041
and get into trouble
with her friends.

212
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:25,739
My mom? Your mom.

213
00:09:25,782 --> 00:09:28,916
And then she would
climb up the tree

214
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,309
on the side of the house
and sneak back in.

215
00:09:31,353 --> 00:09:33,224
Amazing.

216
00:09:33,268 --> 00:09:35,313
Is that how you're getting in?

217
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:37,664
I will never tell you that.

218
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:49,284
Everything okay?

219
00:09:49,327 --> 00:09:53,244
I'm getting tired of being
the bad guy around here.

220
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:54,898
You're not the bad guy.

221
00:09:54,942 --> 00:09:56,596
Kids need boundaries.

222
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:57,858
That is easy

223
00:09:57,901 --> 00:10:00,077
for you to say.
I am the only one doing it,

224
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:02,079
and then everyone
resents me for it.

225
00:10:02,123 --> 00:10:03,777
Hey, you're not the only one.

226
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,648
Just today, Georgie and Sheldon
were fighting,

227
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:07,650
and I totally took care of it.

228
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:09,652
Really? What was going on?

229
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:12,873
They... you know, stuff.

230
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,135
I...

231
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:17,094
Don't worry. I got your back.

232
00:10:17,138 --> 00:10:20,576
Thank you. That means a lot.

233
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,622
Teamwork, babe.

234
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:27,714
Look, right...

235
00:10:27,757 --> 00:10:29,890
here.

236
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:32,153
That's my mom?

237
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:36,157
Yep, the little queen
of darkness.

238
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,899
Is she smoking a cigarette?

239
00:10:38,942 --> 00:10:42,293
Yep. Probably stole it from me.

240
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:44,295
When did she stop being cool?

241
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,994
Well, first of all,
smoking is not cool.

242
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:48,996
You do it. Yeah, well, next time

243
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:51,128
I'm hocking up some black goo
out of my lung,

244
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:53,478
I'll call you over
and you can see how cool it is.

245
00:10:53,522 --> 00:10:56,090
Awesome. It is not awesome.

246
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:58,396
And as far as your mom,
I think things started

247
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,530
to turn around for her
when she gave birth to you.

248
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:03,358
You mean me and Sheldon.

249
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:05,142
No, I mean you.

250
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:08,580
I mean, Sheldon was born fine,
but you were a different story.

251
00:11:08,624 --> 00:11:09,886
Why?

252
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,888
Okay.

253
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:16,806
Well, there was a point
where the doctors didn't know

254
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,547
if you were gonna make it.

255
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,724
And your mom got so scared,
and she made a promise to God

256
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:26,207
that if you were okay,
that she would start reading

257
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,297
the Bible, going to church...

258
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,734
you know, that kind of stuff.

259
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:33,867
So I'm the reason she's a dud?

260
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,782
Your takeaway should be

261
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:39,742
that you are the reason she's
such a good mom, which she is.

262
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:41,285
And the next time
you hurt her feelings...

263
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:43,267
Which you will...

264
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:47,445
You might remember
how much you mean to her.

265
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:51,711
Now I feel bad.

266
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,716
Good.

267
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,242
News of my friendship with Tommy

268
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:03,026
had apparently spread.

269
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,768
So much so,
the student body was finally

270
00:12:05,812 --> 00:12:09,337
treating me
with the respect I deserved,

271
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,382
even when Tommy wasn't around.

272
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:17,084
This must be
how Carl Sagan felt,

273
00:12:17,127 --> 00:12:19,260
walking through
the halls of PBS.

274
00:12:27,485 --> 00:12:29,246
 Like
Superman in a phone booth,

275
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:32,273
I was no stranger to undressing
in my gym locker.

276
00:12:32,316 --> 00:12:34,014
But not today.

277
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:37,060
Thanks to Tommy,
I was invincible.

278
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:40,411
All right, get your butts
out to the gym.

279
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:42,849
Wind sprints in one minute.

280
00:12:48,593 --> 00:12:50,334
Come on, Jason,
I'm gonna be late.

281
00:12:50,378 --> 00:12:51,553
Poor baby.

282
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:57,298
Excuse me.

283
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:58,821
I'd like to ask you
some questions

284
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:02,085
about your use of intimidation
to dominate others.

285
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:08,962
Are you trying
to get your ass kicked?

286
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:12,835
No, I was just looking to open
a spirited dialogue.

287
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:14,663
And you might want to unhand me.

288
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:16,839
I'm friends with Tommy Clarkson.

289
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:18,014
Is that so?

290
00:13:18,058 --> 00:13:19,450
Yes.

291
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:22,279
Hello, Tommy.

292
00:13:22,323 --> 00:13:24,020
I have some unfortunate news.

293
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:25,717
What's that? I boasted

294
00:13:25,761 --> 00:13:27,502
to Jason Davies
that you're my friend,

295
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:29,330
and things took
an unexpected turn.

296
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:30,873
You're scheduled to
fight him at 300 p.m.

297
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:32,724
on the basketball court.

298
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,163
I don't want
to fight Jason Davies.

299
00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:39,035
I don't think you have a choice.
He was pretty adamant.

300
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,517
Fine, I'll deal with it.

301
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,128
You do have the option
of simply not showing up.

302
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:47,391
That's not
how fights work, Sheldon.

303
00:13:47,435 --> 00:13:50,177
Why? Do they take attendance?

304
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:01,928
What on Earth did you say
to Missy?

305
00:14:01,971 --> 00:14:04,408
Why? What'd she do now? Nothing,

306
00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:05,757
she was an angel.

307
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:07,063
I dropped her off at school,

308
00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:09,761
and she hugged me
in front of her friends.

309
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:11,502
Really? And not just
any friends.

310
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:15,245
Heather M. Was there,
and that is a big deal.

311
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:17,552
I just gave her
a little life advice.

312
00:14:17,595 --> 00:14:18,945
Like what?

313
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:21,904
Nothing, just grandma stuff.

314
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:26,691
There you go again,
being the good guy.

315
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:29,520
Mary, you need to know

316
00:14:29,564 --> 00:14:32,741
you're doing a fantastic job
with those kids.

317
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:35,135
You really mean that?

318
00:14:35,178 --> 00:14:37,920
I really do.Thanks.

319
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:42,533
I can't remember the last time
someone said I was a good mom.

320
00:14:42,577 --> 00:14:47,364
It's not a job that gets
a lot of compliments.

321
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:55,068
Look at this, my
mother left me a note.

322
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:58,941
"You can do better. Mom."

323
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:01,683
Not "Love, Mom," not "XO, Mom,"

324
00:15:01,726 --> 00:15:03,337
just "Mom."

325
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,686
While prattled on

326
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:06,079
about some family nonsense,

327
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:07,776
I couldn't help
but think about Tommy.

328
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:11,780
At 300 pm, he was going to
engage in a schoolyard battle

329
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:13,869
that was entirely my fault.

330
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,176
I had to find a way
to intervene, but how?

331
00:15:16,219 --> 00:15:18,352
Ooh, a Nutter Butter.

332
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:20,093
Maybe she does love me.

333
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,837
Face-punching time!

334
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:27,056
Jason, let's do it!

335
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,015
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

336
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:30,668
Fight! Fight!

337
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,107
Come on, Jason. Kick his ass.

338
00:15:40,504 --> 00:15:42,637
I didn't have
the physical stature to assist

339
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,161
Tommy in a brawl,
but I did have something

340
00:15:45,205 --> 00:15:47,337
far more lethal

341
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:50,036
My once in a generation brain.

342
00:15:52,255 --> 00:15:54,605
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

343
00:16:01,482 --> 00:16:03,963
I didn't think you'd show up.

344
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:06,704
Well, I did.

345
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:08,793
Let's do this.

346
00:16:08,837 --> 00:16:10,665
Stop!

347
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:15,800
You're not fighting Tommy,
you're fighting me.

348
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,368
Boy.

349
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:19,804
Unless you want to shake hands

350
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:23,286
and we all laugh about this
over a glass of milk.

351
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,985
I think I'd rather kick
both your asses.

352
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:28,030
I was afraid you'd say that.

353
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:29,727
Are you familiar with the story

354
00:16:29,771 --> 00:16:32,643
of David and Goliath
from the Bible?

355
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:33,993
Yeah.

356
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:35,820
That's too bad.

357
00:16:35,864 --> 00:16:37,997
I had a nice speech prepared.

358
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,825
I'll say it anyway.

359
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:43,350
You may have the size advantage,

360
00:16:43,393 --> 00:16:45,134
but like David and his sling,

361
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:48,355
I also possess an
air-based weapon.

362
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:53,055
So I'll give you
one more chance.

363
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:55,057
Are you willing to step down?

364
00:16:56,276 --> 00:16:58,321
I'll tell you what

365
00:16:58,365 --> 00:17:02,369
You take the first shot,
then it's my turn.

366
00:17:02,412 --> 00:17:04,458
Very well.

367
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,417
Three...

368
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:10,072
two...

369
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:14,642
one.

370
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:25,566
Son of a bitch!

371
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:34,662
I'm going to run.

372
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,541
Conventional wisdom tells us

373
00:17:44,585 --> 00:17:46,891
that when one stands up
to a bully, the bully

374
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:49,218
will inevitably back down and
respect you for your courage.

375
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:51,331
My experience
suggests otherwise.

376
00:17:51,374 --> 00:17:54,595
Hello? Hello?

377
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:56,249
When Jason finally caught me,

378
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:59,078
he had the good sense not
to commit assault and battery.

379
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:00,601
This did not, however,
prevent him

380
00:18:00,644 --> 00:18:02,733
from imprisoning me
in his locker.

381
00:18:02,777 --> 00:18:05,388
Anybody?

382
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:07,303
That was a very long night.

383
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:09,566
It doesn't smell good in here.

384
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,785
Very long.

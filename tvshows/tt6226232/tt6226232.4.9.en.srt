2
00:00:01,826 --> 00:00:03,974
You must be
Coach Ballard's ex-wife.

3
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:06,132
Yeah.
Why?

4
00:00:06,227 --> 00:00:08,132
I'm kind of dating
your ex-husband.

5
00:00:08,218 --> 00:00:09,907
I knew who you were
the whole time.

6
00:00:09,992 --> 00:00:11,243
That's why
I came over here.

7
00:00:11,328 --> 00:00:12,726
Nicely played.

8
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:14,637
We ought to go out for drinks
one night.

9
00:00:14,722 --> 00:00:16,476
Hell yeah!

10
00:00:16,587 --> 00:00:17,828
Yee-haw!

11
00:00:19,704 --> 00:00:22,367
<i>College is a time
for new experiences,</i>

12
00:00:22,453 --> 00:00:25,046
<i>being exposed
to exciting ways of thinking,</i>

13
00:00:25,131 --> 00:00:27,218
meeting people
from different backgrounds,

14
00:00:27,406 --> 00:00:30,429
and the unexpected visit
from your dad in gym shorts.

15
00:00:30,585 --> 00:00:31,585
Hey.

16
00:00:31,703 --> 00:00:33,213
What are you doing here?

17
00:00:33,297 --> 00:00:34,703
I got a phone call.

18
00:00:34,788 --> 00:00:36,707
Apparently, the head of the
college wants to talk to us.

19
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:39,623
Oh, good.
You sure it's good?

20
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:41,305
Well, it's better than
what I thought when I saw you,

21
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:43,765
- which was, "Uh-oh, Meemaw died."
- Come on.

22
00:00:44,737 --> 00:00:46,133
I was hoping in
college you wouldn't

23
00:00:46,217 --> 00:00:47,875
get called to the
principal's office anymore.

24
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:49,877
She's not the principal.
She's the president.

25
00:00:50,037 --> 00:00:52,001
So if you're in trouble,
you're in big trouble.

26
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,789
That's a fun way to look at it.

27
00:00:54,057 --> 00:00:56,218
Gentlemen, please have a seat.

28
00:00:56,617 --> 00:00:58,345
Sheldon's only been here
a few weeks.

29
00:00:58,429 --> 00:00:59,914
I hope he's not
in trouble already.

30
00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:01,508
What kind of trouble?
Did something happen?

31
00:01:01,592 --> 00:01:02,805
Ooh, maybe it's
from when I decided...

32
00:01:02,889 --> 00:01:04,437
Uh, uh, all good.

33
00:01:04,574 --> 00:01:06,234
Uh, you keep talking.

34
00:01:06,336 --> 00:01:08,429
Well, I'll just get
right to the point.

35
00:01:08,574 --> 00:01:10,234
Uh, I would like you
and your son

36
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,203
to meet with a very important
benefactor of the college.

37
00:01:13,511 --> 00:01:14,625
Why us?

38
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,605
Well, I mean, Sheldon is...

39
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:18,313
is an impressive addition

40
00:01:18,398 --> 00:01:20,148
to the physics program,

41
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:23,031
and-and we like our donors
to feel really good

42
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:24,507
about where their money's going.

43
00:01:24,592 --> 00:01:26,758
I get it.
You want the star quarterback

44
00:01:26,843 --> 00:01:28,268
to shake some hands
with the boosters.

45
00:01:28,352 --> 00:01:29,966
Exactly. I'm not doing that.

46
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,844
I didn't shake her hand,
and she's the president.

47
00:01:31,928 --> 00:01:34,367
No, you don't have
to shake anybody's hand.

48
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:35,710
Then why did you say it?

49
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:37,648
I didn't say it.
He said it.

50
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:38,898
But you agreed with it.

51
00:01:38,983 --> 00:01:41,937
All I'm asking you to do is
to go to dinner,

52
00:01:42,022 --> 00:01:45,171
talk about science with a very
nice and, more importantly,

53
00:01:45,304 --> 00:01:46,664
a very rich person.

54
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:47,993
Understood.

55
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:50,257
No, thank you.Buddy...

56
00:01:50,617 --> 00:01:53,835
All right, uh, Sheldon,
I was brought to this school

57
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,813
to help raise its profile,
and one of the ways to do that

58
00:01:57,898 --> 00:01:59,907
is through grants and donations.

59
00:01:59,992 --> 00:02:01,570
You-you can understand that,
right?

60
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:03,946
I understand that you would like
to put the novelty of my age

61
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,453
and advanced intellect
on display to raise some cash.

62
00:02:06,592 --> 00:02:08,523
No. Sort of.

63
00:02:08,725 --> 00:02:11,268
- Can I speak to you alone?
- Will you give us a minute?

64
00:02:11,484 --> 00:02:13,274
Very well.
But if you're looking to see

65
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:14,836
if my father will be
a potential donor,

66
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,922
you are barking up
the wrong tree.

74
00:02:37,203 --> 00:02:38,390
So...

75
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:41,148
how do we get your son
to cooperate?

76
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:43,476
I've been asking myself that
since day one.

77
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:45,579
Look, I don't mean
to put pressure on you,

78
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:47,304
but there's
a lot of pressure on me,

79
00:02:47,388 --> 00:02:48,804
so I'm going to put it
on you.

80
00:02:49,273 --> 00:02:51,790
Look, I'm sorry,
isn't there anyone else

81
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,236
who can go to dinner
with this guy?

82
00:02:53,414 --> 00:02:55,933
So I have a unicorn in my zoo,

83
00:02:56,049 --> 00:02:59,533
but I should trot out a goat,
is that what you're saying?

84
00:02:59,617 --> 00:03:01,884
Would you donate a new library

85
00:03:01,968 --> 00:03:03,537
to have dinner with a goat?

86
00:03:03,621 --> 00:03:05,062
What restaurant?

87
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,593
Mr. Cooper, I need you
to understand something.

88
00:03:09,678 --> 00:03:13,859
This university relies
on donations for everything.

89
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,993
For upkeep,
for salaries,

90
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:20,175
for scholarships, like the one
your son is currently on.

91
00:03:20,377 --> 00:03:22,054
I'll talk to him.

92
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:23,828
Thank you.

93
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:28,593
And when you go to dinner,
wear real pants.

94
00:03:32,068 --> 00:03:33,821
So, there's this thing

95
00:03:33,906 --> 00:03:35,507
at school
I really want to go to,

96
00:03:35,592 --> 00:03:38,476
and before you say no, I just
want you to think about it.

97
00:03:38,613 --> 00:03:41,184
- What is it?
- Like a school function.

98
00:03:41,343 --> 00:03:43,429
Why would I say no
to a school function?

99
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:44,839
So I can go?
You're the best.

100
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,289
Hold on.

101
00:03:46,386 --> 00:03:48,523
What kind of function
are we talking about?

102
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,352
You know,
just the normal kind.

103
00:03:50,437 --> 00:03:51,828
With some kids.

104
00:03:51,913 --> 00:03:53,179
And some music.

105
00:03:53,268 --> 00:03:55,085
You know you can't go
to a dance.

106
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,174
Why not?

107
00:03:56,259 --> 00:03:57,507
You know that,
too.

108
00:03:57,592 --> 00:03:58,781
Because we're Baptist.

109
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:00,305
But all my friends
are going.

110
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,429
That doesn't
change anything.

111
00:04:03,398 --> 00:04:05,140
What if I promise
not to dance?

112
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,625
So you expect me
to believe

113
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,280
that you are going to go
to a dance with your friends,

114
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:12,390
they'll all be dancing
while you just stand there?

115
00:04:12,475 --> 00:04:14,171
I go to church
and don't pray.

116
00:04:14,256 --> 00:04:16,109
How is this any different?

117
00:04:19,363 --> 00:04:21,278
Where we eating tonight?

118
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:23,164
Well, that depends.

119
00:04:23,249 --> 00:04:24,688
Why don't you look
in the glovebox

120
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:26,976
and check on the Tums situation.

121
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:30,239
There's five.

122
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:32,329
Oh, my, this is tricky.

123
00:04:32,414 --> 00:04:34,460
Well, Mexican's
at least three apiece.

124
00:04:34,545 --> 00:04:37,140
We might get by with two each
if it's Italian.

125
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:39,929
You get red wine and
then tomato sauce.

126
00:04:40,148 --> 00:04:42,593
Hey, if they put lemon
in the water, we're dead.

127
00:04:42,678 --> 00:04:45,703
- Hmm. That leaves barbecue.
- Sold.

128
00:04:46,609 --> 00:04:48,375
Who gets Tum number three?

129
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,523
Me. They're my Tums.

130
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,875
Now, what do you
think young people

131
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,312
talk about on
their dates?

132
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:57,889
I don't know.

133
00:04:57,974 --> 00:05:01,241
But my knee's telling me
it's gonna rain this weekend.

134
00:05:01,326 --> 00:05:04,550
Speaking of this weekend, hey,
my son needs a final head count.

135
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:05,976
Oh.

136
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,952
It's a small wedding.

137
00:05:08,037 --> 00:05:09,825
It'll be weird if I'm there.

138
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,569
Aw, come on,
I'm gonna be wearing a suit.

139
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,114
I'm very sexy in a suit.

140
00:05:16,794 --> 00:05:18,022
Come on, Sheldon,

141
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:19,819
think of it
as a free dinner.

142
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:22,254
I'm a kid.
All my dinners are free.

143
00:05:24,395 --> 00:05:26,124
Is what they're asking
really that bad?

144
00:05:26,246 --> 00:05:28,805
Yes. I go to this university
to study science,

145
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,725
not to help collect money
like an organ grinder's monkey.

146
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,881
You see me go to the rallies and
fundraisers at the high school.

147
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:37,046
I don't love it,
but I do it.

148
00:05:37,131 --> 00:05:39,499
And I hope they give you
all the bananas you can eat.

149
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,147
Sheldon, donors like this are
very helpful for the university.

150
00:05:43,232 --> 00:05:46,272
They pay for all the science
equipment and your scholarship.

151
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,522
I hadn't thought of it
that way.

152
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:50,967
So I'll tell 'em
we're on for Saturday?

153
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,499
I'll think about it.

154
00:05:52,598 --> 00:05:54,249
What's to think about?

155
00:05:54,351 --> 00:05:56,617
It's a night of you
showing off how smart you are.

156
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,276
People do like that.

157
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,171
All right, I'm in.

158
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:08,152
Can I put on the game?

159
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:09,372
I don't care.

160
00:06:09,457 --> 00:06:10,750
Sweet!

161
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,805
What's your problem?

162
00:06:15,999 --> 00:06:18,091
Did you ever go
to a school dance?

163
00:06:18,686 --> 00:06:20,046
One or two.

164
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,092
How'd you get Mom
to let you?

165
00:06:22,342 --> 00:06:24,300
Easy. Didn't ask her.

166
00:06:25,064 --> 00:06:27,461
By the way, that works
for all kinds of stuff.

167
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,006
Well, it's too late.
I already asked.

168
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,014
Rookie mistake.

169
00:06:32,294 --> 00:06:34,631
Why can't we have
a fun religion?

170
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,119
I don't think
there is one.

171
00:06:40,054 --> 00:06:41,866
Come with me.

172
00:06:49,822 --> 00:06:50,913
Here.

173
00:06:50,998 --> 00:06:51,958
What is it?

174
00:06:52,043 --> 00:06:53,570
The answer to your problems.

175
00:06:53,655 --> 00:06:55,442
Cool. What other tapes you got?

176
00:06:55,751 --> 00:06:58,232
Nature films.
Don't worry about it.

177
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:02,608
Hey. I just got off the phone
with President Hagemeyer.

178
00:07:02,693 --> 00:07:05,213
This guy we're gonna have dinner
with sounds pretty interesting.

179
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,895
He made all of his money
selling antistatic furniture

180
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,296
for laboratories.

181
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:10,913
He's not even a scientist?

182
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:12,699
He's just a furniture salesman?

183
00:07:13,873 --> 00:07:14,964
Yeah.

184
00:07:15,049 --> 00:07:16,397
What am I supposed
to talk about?

185
00:07:16,482 --> 00:07:17,878
Talk about whatever you want.

186
00:07:17,963 --> 00:07:19,874
Just... don't be insulting.

187
00:07:19,964 --> 00:07:22,280
What if he says something
I think is ridiculous?

188
00:07:22,372 --> 00:07:23,985
Keep it to yourself.

189
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,266
What if you just said
something

190
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,783
I think is ridiculous?
Because...

191
00:07:26,868 --> 00:07:28,394
Okay, maybe we need
to work a little

192
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:29,686
on your conversation skills,

193
00:07:29,771 --> 00:07:32,473
like not calling people out
for saying stupid things.

194
00:07:32,558 --> 00:07:34,389
How am I supposed
to practice that?

195
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:36,507
What's up?

196
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:45,836
- Hello.
<i>- Hey, June.</i>

197
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:47,187
It's Connie Tucker.

198
00:07:47,272 --> 00:07:48,843
Hey, Connie.
How are you?

199
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:49,992
I'm good.

200
00:07:50,077 --> 00:07:51,921
Am I seeing you
Saturday night?

201
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:53,734
Well, that's
what I've called about.

202
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:55,398
Are you sure
you want me there?

203
00:07:55,483 --> 00:07:57,022
I mean,
it is your son's wedding.

204
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:59,179
Oh, it's his second wedding.
Those barely count.

205
00:07:59,264 --> 00:08:00,882
Besides,
I'm bringing a date, too.

206
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:02,569
Come on, it'll be fun.

207
00:08:03,053 --> 00:08:05,163
Okay. I'm in.

208
00:08:05,248 --> 00:08:06,312
Fantastic!

209
00:08:06,397 --> 00:08:07,820
So, how dressed up we getting?

210
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:10,499
Oh, it's a small ceremony,
nothing fancy.

211
00:08:10,638 --> 00:08:12,907
You just saying that 'cause
you want to look better than me?

212
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:14,445
Of course not.

213
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,022
But I do believe
you'd be stunning in overalls.

214
00:08:17,978 --> 00:08:19,171
All right.

215
00:08:19,256 --> 00:08:20,296
See you then.

216
00:08:20,381 --> 00:08:21,506
Bye.

217
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,124
Overalls, my ass.

218
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:26,178
<i>So you really
can't dance here, man?</i>

219
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,851
I can't believe that.

220
00:08:27,936 --> 00:08:29,319
<i>- It's true.</i>
<i>- See?</i>

221
00:08:29,404 --> 00:08:30,942
They ain't allowed
to dance, either.

222
00:08:31,026 --> 00:08:33,412
It's like
I'm watching my life.

223
00:08:33,662 --> 00:08:36,031
That's how I feel when
I'm watching Top Gun.

224
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:41,147
Okay, Sheldon, try having
a conversation with Billy

225
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:42,490
about science.

226
00:08:42,725 --> 00:08:43,788
Let's see.

227
00:08:43,873 --> 00:08:45,850
Uh, what do you know
about quantum mechanics?

228
00:08:45,935 --> 00:08:47,560
My dad's a mechanic.

229
00:08:47,754 --> 00:08:51,076
At his shop, he has a calendar
with a bikini lady on it.

230
00:08:51,504 --> 00:08:52,515
Dad...

231
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,373
Instead of losing patience,

232
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:57,506
act interested
and ask a follow-up question.

233
00:08:58,545 --> 00:09:00,350
Your father's a mechanic.

234
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:01,741
Interesting.

235
00:09:01,826 --> 00:09:02,953
You know what else
is interesting?

236
00:09:03,037 --> 00:09:04,788
Quantum mechanics.
That describes

237
00:09:04,873 --> 00:09:07,007
the basic particles and forces
that make up reality.

238
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:08,374
Let's talk about that.

239
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,587
I'm gonna marry
that bikini lady.

240
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,767
I've been working on a theory

241
00:09:13,851 --> 00:09:16,210
about the wave-particle
duality of light.

242
00:09:16,295 --> 00:09:18,616
I have a nightlight
that looks like Spider-Man,

243
00:09:18,701 --> 00:09:20,490
but I don't turn it on.

244
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,288
Go ahead.

245
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,983
Why don't you turn it on?

246
00:09:26,068 --> 00:09:27,874
- I'm afraid of spiders.
- Yeah, seems like

247
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,296
a good place to stop.

248
00:09:29,381 --> 00:09:30,493
Now what happens?

249
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:31,915
You go home.

250
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,056
Thank you for your hospitality.

251
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:35,751
<i>And it was King David.</i>

252
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:41,011
King David, who-who we read
about in-in Samuel.

253
00:09:41,382 --> 00:09:43,477
<i>And-and-and what did David do?</i>

254
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:45,142
<i>What did David do?</i>

255
00:09:45,227 --> 00:09:47,105
<i>What did David do?
David danced.</i>

256
00:09:47,189 --> 00:09:48,411
"David danced

257
00:09:48,495 --> 00:09:50,603
"before the Lord
with all his might,

258
00:09:50,735 --> 00:09:52,937
leaping and dancing
before the Lord."

259
00:09:53,321 --> 00:09:55,353
Leaping and dancing.

260
00:09:55,438 --> 00:09:57,430
- I'm impressed.
- Thank you.

261
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,540
Too bad it's from Footloose.

262
00:10:00,094 --> 00:10:01,797
What's a footloose?

263
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:04,369
It is the movie that
Pastor Jeff warned us about

264
00:10:04,454 --> 00:10:07,134
in his talk on the
sins of cinema.

265
00:10:07,219 --> 00:10:08,518
Just let me go
to the dance.

266
00:10:08,751 --> 00:10:10,633
I'm sorry. I can't.

267
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,907
I'm never talking to you
again!

268
00:10:15,555 --> 00:10:17,579
Did you show your
sister Footloose?

269
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,478
- Did it work?
- No!

270
00:10:19,563 --> 00:10:20,735
Mm. Then no.

271
00:10:20,857 --> 00:10:22,337
Oh!

272
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,823
Now, when you meet this guy,

273
00:10:25,907 --> 00:10:27,072
you got to shake his hand.

274
00:10:27,157 --> 00:10:28,728
What if I offer a stately bow?

275
00:10:28,813 --> 00:10:30,189
That's how they do it in Asia.

276
00:10:30,274 --> 00:10:31,735
You're shaking his hand.

277
00:10:32,461 --> 00:10:34,868
Then it's a good thing
I brought Old Righty.

278
00:10:35,063 --> 00:10:37,322
You're not wearing that
in a restaurant.

279
00:10:37,407 --> 00:10:38,287
Why?

280
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,723
'Cause you don't
make a good impression

281
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:41,275
by being afraid
to shake hands.

282
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,900
Howard Hughes was a germophobe,

283
00:10:42,985 --> 00:10:44,369
and he did quite well
for himself.

284
00:10:44,454 --> 00:10:46,845
Didn't he go crazy
and save his pee in jars?

285
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,049
Better to have it
and not need it

286
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:49,166
than to need it
and not have it.

287
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,947
- You're shaking his hand!
- Okay!

288
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:56,509
Haven't been
to many weddings lately.

289
00:10:56,594 --> 00:10:57,958
Mostly funerals.

290
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,939
Yeah, those don't have an open bar.

291
00:11:01,024 --> 00:11:02,533
I don't know
why I'm so excited.

292
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:03,806
I'm paying for this.

293
00:11:03,891 --> 00:11:05,275
Hey, y'all.

294
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,470
Hi, June!

295
00:11:06,555 --> 00:11:07,923
Don't you look pretty?

296
00:11:08,008 --> 00:11:08,978
Thank you.

297
00:11:09,063 --> 00:11:10,242
I happen to agree.

298
00:11:11,688 --> 00:11:13,836
Connie, Dale,
this is Justin.

299
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:16,791
Hi, Justin. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.

300
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:18,496
You must be
a friend of my son's.

301
00:11:18,602 --> 00:11:20,452
Actually, he's my date.

302
00:11:21,732 --> 00:11:23,432
Really?

303
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:24,637
Mm-hmm.

304
00:11:24,938 --> 00:11:27,555
Much more fun than
a funeral.

305
00:11:30,383 --> 00:11:31,923
George Cooper,

306
00:11:32,008 --> 00:11:33,431
meet Gary O'Brien,

307
00:11:33,516 --> 00:11:35,251
the antistatic
furniture king.

308
00:11:35,336 --> 00:11:36,228
Hello.

309
00:11:36,313 --> 00:11:37,220
Shocking to meet you.

310
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:39,564
Don't do that.
And this, of course,

311
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:41,361
is our physics prodigy,

312
00:11:41,446 --> 00:11:42,861
Sheldon Cooper.

313
00:11:42,946 --> 00:11:44,438
A great pleasure.

314
00:11:44,593 --> 00:11:47,406
<i>I had an obligation to fulfill.</i>

315
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:50,860
<i>So I closed my eyes
and thought of science.</i>

316
00:11:52,704 --> 00:11:54,407
<i>Just like on my honeymoon.</i>

317
00:11:57,165 --> 00:11:59,102
How's pizza sound
for dinner?

318
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:02,305
You think I'm eating dinner
with my mom on a Saturday night?

319
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,563
You're adorable.

320
00:12:06,654 --> 00:12:08,251
Guess I'm eating alone.

321
00:12:08,374 --> 00:12:09,547
What about Missy?

322
00:12:09,632 --> 00:12:11,618
She's not talking to me.

323
00:12:11,703 --> 00:12:13,490
She'd talk to you
if you just let her go.

324
00:12:13,574 --> 00:12:15,144
You know I can't do that.

325
00:12:15,228 --> 00:12:18,383
Come on. I went to school dances
and I turned out fine.

326
00:12:19,227 --> 00:12:21,150
I didn't let you go
to any dances.

327
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,413
I did all kinds of stuff
behind your back.

328
00:12:23,497 --> 00:12:24,588
Like what?

329
00:12:25,118 --> 00:12:26,938
I'm dumb,
but I'm not that dumb.

330
00:12:27,094 --> 00:12:29,205
So I'm supposed
to just let her do

331
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,322
whatever she wants?

332
00:12:30,407 --> 00:12:31,900
Yeah, I don't think so.

333
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,163
I'm just saying
she's a good kid.

334
00:12:34,247 --> 00:12:36,133
Be glad she's still asking.

335
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,907
So, how'd you two meet?

336
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,347
Oh, I've been cutting
his mom's hair for years.

337
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,876
Oh, that's nice.

338
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:47,437
Bet you when she cuts your hair,

339
00:12:47,521 --> 00:12:49,436
you get a lollipop,
don't you?

340
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,633
Oh, he gets
more than a lollipop.

341
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,929
- Really? Is that so?
- Dale.

342
00:12:55,934 --> 00:12:58,517
Okay, so what is it
you do, Langston?

343
00:12:58,602 --> 00:12:59,710
Justin.

344
00:12:59,794 --> 00:13:00,955
Actually, I'm about

345
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,383
to open a frozen
yogurt shop.

346
00:13:02,468 --> 00:13:04,110
Frozen yogurt.
Right.

347
00:13:04,196 --> 00:13:05,847
Isn't that, like,
crappy ice cream?

348
00:13:06,781 --> 00:13:08,907
We consider it a
healthy alternative.

349
00:13:09,016 --> 00:13:11,040
Right.
Crappy ice cream.

350
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,330
It's actually getting
really popular.

351
00:13:13,415 --> 00:13:14,507
I'm gonna invest.

352
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:15,705
Invest money?

353
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,772
What else
would she invest with?

354
00:13:17,856 --> 00:13:19,599
I don't know.
You got fake ice cream.

355
00:13:19,683 --> 00:13:21,514
- How 'bout fake money?
- Well, there's...

356
00:13:21,598 --> 00:13:24,343
Hey, would you mind going
to get me another drink, please?

357
00:13:24,427 --> 00:13:25,444
Happy to.

358
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:26,748
Thank you.

359
00:13:28,102 --> 00:13:29,352
What's your problem?

360
00:13:29,437 --> 00:13:30,697
Yeah, what is your problem?

361
00:13:30,782 --> 00:13:31,960
Who said I had a problem?

362
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,310
- We did.
- You're being rude.

363
00:13:34,394 --> 00:13:37,126
Okay, you want to spend
all your money on some boy toy,

364
00:13:37,211 --> 00:13:38,618
it's none of my business.

365
00:13:38,702 --> 00:13:40,577
Why do you care what she
does with her own money?

366
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:42,100
- Yeah, why?
- Well, you got

367
00:13:42,184 --> 00:13:44,624
some young guy running around,
asking for money.

368
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,361
You don't think I know
what that's all about?

369
00:13:46,445 --> 00:13:48,822
Okay, he didn't ask...
I offered.

370
00:13:48,907 --> 00:13:50,805
And I can do what I want.
I'm a grown woman.

371
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,735
Oh, hell, you were a grown woman
when he was born.

372
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,074
Sheldon, why don't
you tell Mr. O'Brien

373
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:03,208
about some of your goals
at the university.

374
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:05,515
Well, I'm pushing
for stricter dress codes.

375
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:06,777
There are a lot of
belly buttons on display.

376
00:14:06,861 --> 00:14:07,909
Science goals.

377
00:14:07,993 --> 00:14:09,867
My ultimate goal
is to one day devise

378
00:14:09,951 --> 00:14:11,782
the grand unified field theory.

379
00:14:11,866 --> 00:14:13,044
Ah.

380
00:14:13,432 --> 00:14:15,046
You're one of those, are you?

381
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,806
Excuse me?

382
00:14:16,891 --> 00:14:19,884
Well, Kurt Godel's
incompleteness theorems

383
00:14:19,969 --> 00:14:23,625
eliminate the possibility
of a unified theory.

384
00:14:23,782 --> 00:14:25,883
- You honestly believe that?
- Sheldon.

385
00:14:27,812 --> 00:14:29,181
That's... interesting.

386
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:31,374
Tell me more
about how Einstein's life goal

387
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:33,286
was nothing but folly.

388
00:14:35,133 --> 00:14:36,676
What is she thinking?

389
00:14:37,321 --> 00:14:40,314
Maybe she's thinking,
"Why did I come here with this guy?"

390
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,619
Wait, no,

391
00:14:41,704 --> 00:14:43,259
that's what I'm thinking.

392
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,907
You know what I'm talking about.

393
00:14:44,992 --> 00:14:47,111
She brought him here on purpose.

394
00:14:47,196 --> 00:14:49,142
- What purpose?
- To upset me.

395
00:14:49,227 --> 00:14:50,236
You know, Dale,

396
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:52,415
not everything
is always about <i>you.</i>

397
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,059
Well, you're mad at me,
she's mad at me.

398
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,658
It seems like
it's all about me.

399
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,275
Well, you owe
her an apology.

400
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,499
Like hell I do.

401
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,508
Then I'm gonna
do it for you.

402
00:15:00,641 --> 00:15:02,111
No, wait.

403
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:03,336
Connie, wait.

404
00:15:03,462 --> 00:15:04,462
What?

405
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:06,141
Bring me back a beer.

406
00:15:11,186 --> 00:15:12,219
Missy?

407
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:13,814
Go away.

408
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:15,472
I'm not talking to you.

409
00:15:15,704 --> 00:15:17,474
I know you're mad.

410
00:15:17,688 --> 00:15:20,303
But I've been thinking about it,
and...

411
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:24,612
I trust you enough to know
that you will behave yourself.

412
00:15:24,985 --> 00:15:27,484
So, just this once,
you can go.

413
00:15:27,782 --> 00:15:29,205
Thanks, Mom. Love you.

414
00:15:30,616 --> 00:15:32,150
Why won't this open?

415
00:15:32,507 --> 00:15:34,317
Sometimes it sticks!

416
00:15:35,111 --> 00:15:36,724
I know, on the surface,

417
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:38,481
Dale seems
like a...

418
00:15:38,735 --> 00:15:40,044
a bully, but,

419
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:41,280
underneath...

420
00:15:41,364 --> 00:15:42,543
Still a bully.

421
00:15:42,627 --> 00:15:45,546
Well, yes,
but a little less of one, right?

422
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,176
Sure.

423
00:15:47,297 --> 00:15:49,156
Thank you. You know,

424
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:50,895
I'm gonna bring him
a peace offering.

425
00:15:53,011 --> 00:15:54,233
Ain't he cute?

426
00:15:54,552 --> 00:15:56,825
Can you believe
that Dale thinks

427
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,603
the only reason you brought him
here is just to piss him off?

428
00:15:59,687 --> 00:16:01,559
That's exactly why
I brought him.

429
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,792
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- What?

430
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:08,107
Why would you go
out of your way

431
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:10,473
to upset Dale
at your own son's wedding?

432
00:16:10,606 --> 00:16:12,486
I don't know.
He's my ex-husband.

433
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,574
Well, he's my boyfriend.

434
00:16:13,658 --> 00:16:14,879
Hey, that's your problem.

435
00:16:15,105 --> 00:16:16,637
Well, you're starting
to be my problem.

436
00:16:16,722 --> 00:16:18,817
Geez,
who's the bully now?

437
00:16:19,475 --> 00:16:21,781
I knew
I shouldn't have come here.

438
00:16:26,671 --> 00:16:28,414
Your ex-wife is a bitch.

439
00:16:28,645 --> 00:16:31,374
I am so filled with love
for you right now.

440
00:16:33,036 --> 00:16:36,260
I believe we have to look
to gravity and its magnitude...

441
00:16:36,376 --> 00:16:39,077
<i>I was really doing my best
to hold it together.</i>

442
00:16:39,161 --> 00:16:42,786
...could be a repulsive force
if you just add negative mass.

443
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:44,474
<i>I smiled and nodded</i>

444
00:16:44,558 --> 00:16:47,085
<i>like my meemaw's
Houston Oilers bobblehead.</i>

445
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:48,818
And I also discovered a way

446
00:16:48,903 --> 00:16:50,459
that we could
predict the masses

447
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:51,873
of all the known particles

448
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:54,630
using the Egyptian pyramids.

449
00:16:54,715 --> 00:16:58,670
<i>In physics, there's a phenomenon
known as supercritical assembly.</i>

450
00:16:58,755 --> 00:17:02,360
If you bring enough material
together in one place...

451
00:17:02,445 --> 00:17:04,625
The trick is numerology.

452
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:06,450
<i>...in the right configuration,</i>

453
00:17:06,535 --> 00:17:08,757
eventually, it will explode.

454
00:17:08,868 --> 00:17:10,895
This is fun. Not a lot of
people I can talk to

455
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,419
scientist-to-scientist.

456
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,810
We're not talking
scientist-to-scientist.

457
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:18,123
You're not a scientist.
You're just a rich man that

458
00:17:18,223 --> 00:17:20,544
no one will be honest to because
everyone wants your money.

459
00:17:24,032 --> 00:17:25,471
Oh, don't listen to him.

460
00:17:25,555 --> 00:17:26,908
I mean, he's just a kid.

461
00:17:26,992 --> 00:17:28,953
Why don't you tell me
a little more

462
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:31,380
about your pyramid
thingy? Huh?

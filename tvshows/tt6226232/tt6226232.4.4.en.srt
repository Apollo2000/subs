1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,159
Previously on Young Sheldon...
Do you know if he'll be doing

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,159
the full color octet
calculations?

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,769
I do not.

4
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,439
Do you know how to differentiate
under the integral sign?

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,689
No.

6
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,059
Do you know anything?

7
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,649
Anyone know
what happens to baryons?

8
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,149
Yes, Paige.

9
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,939
We can ignore
the particle masses

10
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,699
at the individual quark level.

11
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,699
- Correct.
- A unique child

12
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,199
can require a lot of attention.

13
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,699
Try all the attention.

14
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,539
Well,
I think my parents are getting a divorce.

15
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,449
Why? They fight all the time.

16
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,919
About what? Mostly me.

17
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,959
I guess I'm lucky. Why?

18
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,799
I'm the glue that holds
our family together.

19
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,129
Hi,
Sheldon. What did you do to your hair?

20
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,799
Is this because your parents
got divorced?

21
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,179
You're so smart. Why
are you acting like this?

22
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,389
My mom is going on dates,

23
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,469
and my dad is
acting like a child.

24
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,520
It's just hard to care.

25
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,520
Can I offer you a hot beverage?

26
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,619
Children everywhere

27
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,749
are excited by summer vacation,

28
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,999
and I was no exception.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,129
Because instead of
vacation Bible school

30
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,219
with my sister,
I was headed to the local library

31
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,549
for a fun-filled week
of postal delights

32
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,809
otherwise known as stamp camp.

33
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,969
In 1989,
they released dinosaur stamps.

34
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,979
Come on, now.

35
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,019
He's excited. And that gets

36
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,479
my stamp of approval.

37
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,859
I'm using that.

38
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,149
It's going to kill
at stamp camp.

39
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,239
Oh, sorry. It was canceled.

40
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,489
What? Why?

41
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,989
Not enough interest.

42
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,989
Not enough interest in stamps?

43
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,239
It's the fastest-growing
hobby in people 70 and over

44
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,039
according to Reader's Digest.

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,499
Sorry, sweetie.

46
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,169
Well,
what am I supposed to do now?

47
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,170
Ha! You have to
go to Bible camp.

48

49
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,739
Come on,
Shelly. It's a space theme.

50
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,359
Isn't that fun?

51
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,359
Jesus was a carpenter,
not an astronaut.

52
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,029
Maybe he built the rocket.

53
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,699
What would he use for fuel?

54
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,039
Ooh, doughnut holes.

55
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,869
Can I please wait in the car?

56
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,789
No. I want you to be here.

57
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,749
I'll be fine. You can
crack the back window.

58
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,379
Hi, Sheldon.

59
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,799
Paige. What are you doing
here? My mom made me.

60
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,379
See? She doesn't
want to be here either.

61
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,259
I'm gonna go say hi to your mom.

62
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,639
Why did your mom make you?

63
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,969
Punishment. I got
caught with cigarettes.

64
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:42,970
Why would you want to smoke?

65
00:02:42,971 --> 00:02:44,269
To look older.

66
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,559
My meemaw smokes.
I guess it works.

67
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,399
So, why are you here?

68
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,309
Do you believe
in this stuff now?

69
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,019
No. Stamp camp got canceled.

70
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,319
Further proof there is no God.

71
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,239
I did it. I bought a car.

72
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,489
Really? You got the Mustang?

73
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,989
I was fixing to,

74
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,949
but then something
else caught my eye.

75
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,539
You did something dumb.

76
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,499
Now,
it needs a little bit of work,

77
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,419
but once I'm done,

78
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,459
it's gonna be amazing. No.

79
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,129
What do you mean?

80
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,839
It's got low mileage,

81
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,549
great stereo.

82
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,180
Check this out.

83
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,759
Look at all the room.

84
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,309
Hell no.

85
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,019
Why?

86
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,769
This isn't a car. It's a
motel room on wheels.

87
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,939
Is that how little
you think of me?

88
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,069
Yes. Maybe less.

89
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,609
George, your mother works

90
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,609
for the church. This
doesn't look good.

91
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,779
I don't know,
looks pretty good to me.

92
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,489
Please,
listen to me. Come on.

93
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,029
If I drive Sheldon to college,
he can sleep back there.

94
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,449
So, you saw that couch,

95
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,079
and the first
thought you had was,

96
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,669
"My brother can sleep on that"?

97
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,959
Not my first thought.

98
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,839
This licorice tastes terrible.

99
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,349
It's plastic.

100
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,059
You use it to weave a lanyard.

101
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,810
No, it's licorice.

102
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,979
Your mother lets
you wear lipstick?

103
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,809
Of course not. Interesting.

104
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,149
Does she know you're
leading a double life?

105
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,479
Grow up.

106
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,779
Why do you think
you're rebelling

107
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,359
against parental authority?

108
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,779
Isn't it obvious? I'm having

109
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,529
a textbook reaction
to their divorce.

110
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,749
What textbook? Did
you get it from the library?

111
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,829
Hello, Biblenauts!

112
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,500
Gather round.

113
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,839
Now, who's ready to find

114
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,380
space for Jesus in our hearts?

115
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,719
I can't hear you!

116
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,259
Perhaps that's because
space is a vacuum

117
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,849
where sound doesn't travel.

118
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,349
Nicely done.

119
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,179
You're not the only
rebel around here.

120
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,269
I thought he had stamp camp.

121
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,689
Just go get your money
back and buy a different car.

122
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,859
No.

123
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,939
Georgie, I'm not playing around.

124
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,779
Neither am I. I bought
it with my own money,

125
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,189
and you don't get a say.

126
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,529
As long as you
live under my roof,

127
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,739
I get plenty of say.

128
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,199
Fine. I'll move out.

129
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,699
And where you gonna go?

130
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,029
I'll live in the van.

131
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,659
You know what?

132
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,159
It was only a matter of time

133
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,119
before you lived
in a van. Have at it.

134
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,169
Scooby-Doo lived in a van,

135
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,629
and he turned out fine.

136
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,979
- All right.
- Amen.

137
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,149
Sing "Ice Ice Baby."

138
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,399
Don't know it.

139
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,269
How about Paula Abdul?

140
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,319
Nope. Ooh! The Teenage
Mutant Ninja theme.

141
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,239
Mary, what is that I'm hearing?

142
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,909
Oh! Right.

143
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,739
It's the prize bell!

144
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,199
What do you think the prize is?

145
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,619
We get to go home?

146
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,579
Is the joke that leaving
would be a reward?

147
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,919
Yes.

148
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,419
I get that joke.

149
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,919
Now,

150
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,169
for a psalm 100 bookmark,

151
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,879
who can name the 12 apostles?

152
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,589
Billy.

153
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,179
Sleepy, Grumpy, Doc...

154
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,179
Those are dwarves. Anyone else?

155
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,929
Look at these suckers trying to
compete for a stupid bookmark.

156
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,309
They probably don't
even know psalm 100.

157
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,639
Or what a book is.

158
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,939
How about six apostles?

159
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,809
Just give me six.

160
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,279
I'll settle for three,
and I'll spot you Judas.

161
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,489
I don't even care about church,
and I can name them all.

162
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,700
So can I.

163
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,779
No, you can't.

164
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,569
Yes, I can.

165
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,779
I can even do it in
alphabetical order.

166
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,949
Well,
I can name them in the order they appear

167
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,790
in the Book of Matthew.

168
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,959
Paige, yes.

169
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,379
Peter, Andrew, James,
son of Zebedee,

170
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,259
John, Philip, Bartholomew,

171
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,969
Thomas, Matthew,

172
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,969
James, son of Alpheus,
Thaddeus, Simon and Judas.

173
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,470
And that's the order that they
appear in the Book of Matthew.

174
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,309
Fantastic!

175
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,389
You just won yourself a
psalm 100 bookmark.

176
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,479
Thank you. I love that psalm.

177
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,609
You would think winning

178
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,319
a Nobel Prize in Physics

179
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,989
would make this moment
meaningless to me,

180
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,240
but all these years later,
it still burns my butt.

181
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,649
Why would Paige get
competitive over Bible trivia?

182
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,609
She doesn't care about that.

183
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,529
Maybe she just
wanted that bookmark.

184
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,109
Yeah. I wanted

185
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,119
this "what would Jesus
do?" slap bracelet.

186
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,739
Ow. I liked it better

187
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,909
when she and I were
making fun of everything.

188
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,749
You might have more
fun if you participated, too.

189
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,619
Oh, I'll participate.

190
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,339
Great. If Paige wants to go
head-to-head on Bible trivia,

191
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,879
she picked the wrong
fact-filled atheist to mess with.

192
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,049
Great.

193
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,589
Ow.

194
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,469
Well?

195
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,349
It's very... colorful.

196
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,809
Not just colorful. Patriotic.

197
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,099
It's also a little gross.

198
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,230
It just needs a little shampoo.
But check out the best part.

199
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,860
Want to try it out?

200
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,779
In front of your parents' house?

201
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,949
That's what's so great.
We can drive it anywhere.

202
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,029
Empty field,

203
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,369
abandoned parking lot.

204
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,829
Wherever love takes us.

205
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,000
What is that smell?

206
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,629
There was a mouse
in the mini fridge.

207
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,289
Ew!

208
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,459
Did you hear me?

209
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,340
There's a mini fridge!

210
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,799
You're really making
him live out there?

211
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,389
He's not gonna last one
night in that nasty thing.

212
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,179
Have you seen that boy's room?

213
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,309
Judah was the father

214
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,309
of Perez and Zerah by Tamar,

215
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,269
Perez was the father of Hezron,

216
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,559
and Hezron was
the father of Ram.

217
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,189
Why's he reading the Bible?

218
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,029
To humiliate and destroy
Paige at Bible camp.

219
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,150
That.

220
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,069
Missy doing anything stupid?

221
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,659
No.

222
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,079
One out of three. Not bad. Hey!

223
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,369
Where do you think you're going?

224
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,829
Bathroom.

225
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,659
No,
you're not. You don't live here.

226
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,879
George. You want him
making grandkids in that van?

227
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,169
You heard him! Get!

228
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,710
Dang it.

229
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,889
Can I use your bathroom?

230
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,219
Your dad wants to talk to you.

231
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,059
Hello.

232
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,719
You can't
use her bathroom either.

233
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,929
Dang it.

234
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,729
There's a bucket in the garage.

235
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,489
Hey.

236
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:31,859
Brought you some food.

237
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,199
Don't tell your father.

238
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,529
Thanks.

239
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,699
Want to come in?

240
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,289
It smells less disgusting now.

241
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,369
I'm... really good here.

242
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,209
Georgie, um,

243
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,499
this is a... nice van,

244
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,549
but why don't you
think about selling it

245
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,379
so you can come back inside?

246
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,969
No. I'm not letting
him win this one.

247
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,389
You know you can't live in here.

248
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,600
Why not?

249
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,559
It's hot out.

250
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,059
The windows roll down.

251
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,269
How are you gonna take a shower?

252
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,899
It's supposed to
rain this weekend.

253
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,609
What about a bathroom?

254
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,399
See that bucket?

255
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,820
Good night.

256
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,489
Ask me what the
fruits of the Spirit are.

257
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,619
I'm sure you know them.

258
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,949
Of course I do.

259
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,909
Love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness,

260
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,579
goodness, faithfulness,
gentleness and self-control.

261
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,079
Then why do I have to ask?

262
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,959
So I can improve my
hand-raising technique.

263
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,629
Fine.

264
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,950
What are the
fruits of the Spirit?

265
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,839
Good. We done?

266
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,130
No, you have to call on me.

267
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,639
Sheldon.

268
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,639
Love, joy, peace, patience,

269
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,889
kindness, goodness,
faithfulness,

270
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,599
gentleness and self-control.

271
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,440
Now ask me to name three
wicked women of the Bible.

272
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,859
Can I ask you a question?

273
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,609
If it's "Who are three
wicked women in the Bible?,"

274
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,769
then go ahead.

275
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,030
Why don't you believe in God?

276
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,699
Sheldon.

277
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,739
Because science
explains the universe

278
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,449
without the need of
inventing a supernatural being.

279
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,539
But how do you know
for sure he doesn't exist?

280
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,159
Ooh. Stop that.

281
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,669
The burden of proof isn't on me.

282
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,959
If I said there was an invisible
monkey in the room with us,

283
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,459
you shouldn't believe me

284
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,169
just because you
can't prove me wrong.

285
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,959
Why is the monkey invisible?

286
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,049
I don't know.

287
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,379
Is it a ghost monkey?

288
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,509
Sure.

289
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,969
Then why isn't he in heaven?

290
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,219
Because there is no heaven.

291
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,469
What about monkey heaven?

292
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,599
There is no monkey heaven.

293
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,179
There is no regular heaven.

294
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,189
When we die,
we cease to exist. That's it.

295
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,149
You better hope you're right.

296
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:29,109
'Cause if I end up in regular
heaven and you end up in hell,

297
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,480
I'm gonna laugh.

298
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,989
But if you end
up in monkey hell,

299
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,529
I'm gonna laugh even harder.

300
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,820
Just paint your nails.

301
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,079
God, when Sheldon dies,

302
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,869
please send him to monkey hell.

303
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,040
Amen.

304
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,059
Get
it off! Get it off!

305
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,849
What was that? It's in my hair!

306
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:03,979
Not my problem.

307
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,019
It's in my hair!

308
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,440
It's in my hair!

309
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,859
For your information,

310
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,029
not only am I going
to show you up today,

311
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,449
I've also prepared
some biblical trash talk.

312
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,909
What is he talking about?

313
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,079
He stayed up all night studying.

314
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,239
Why?

315
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,079
To beat you at Bible trivia.

316
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,539
Just like the prophets of
mercy beat the priestly cult

317
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,419
and its emphasis
on ritual purity.

318
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,129
Was that the trash talk?

319
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,129
Was Zacchaeus a tax collector?

320
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,879
Was Nicodemus a Pharisee?

321
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,469
Just hit him.

322
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,219
Okay, campers!

323
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,719
Bible trivia time.

324
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,049
For a Noah's Ark

325
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,219
rain poncho,

326
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,600
what was Peter's original name?

327
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,939
Sheldon. Peter's
original name was Simon.

328
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,559
Correct! You didn't know that one,
did you?

329
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,609
Yes, I did.

330
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,069
He was also known as Cephas.

331
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,779
Then why didn't
you raise your hand?

332
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,569
'Cause I don't care.

333
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,159
Next question.

334
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,159
For a John the
Baptist pencil topper,

335
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,240
where did Jesus
perform his first miracle?

336
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,169
Sheldon.

337
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,419
A wedding.

338
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,589
Correct!

339
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,589
Aren't you even going to try?

340
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,379
Nope.

341
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,629
Why won't you compete with me?

342
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,469
Because it's fun
watching you get upset.

343
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,139
What's fun about it?

344
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,810
Everything.

345
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,439
Morning, sunshine.

346
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,819
What do you want?

347
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,319
Oh,
just to see how you're doing.

348
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,399
I'm fine.

349
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,529
Thanks for the juice.

350
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,159
Oh, this isn't for you.

351
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,870
Mmm.

352
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,870
Mmm.

353
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,459
Cold and refreshing.

354
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,169
So, how'd you sleep?

355
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,669
You look terrible.

356
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,039
Are you done? Depends.

357
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,959
You ready to return the van?

358
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,010
This van's not going anywhere.

359
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,969
Don't you have to
work this morning?

360
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,010
Crap.

361
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,850
Yep, it's not going anywhere.

362
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,479
Paige,

363
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,269
a sprig of my hair is askew.

364
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,899
Upsetting, isn't it?

365
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,359
No.

366
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,109
But it's going a
different direction

367
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,149
from all the other hairs.

368
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,529
So?

369
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,699
You think it's
fun irritating me?

370
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,659
I'm giving you a taste
of your own medicine.

371
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,330
Ha.

372
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,210
Hey.

373
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,719
I'm on medication, you know.

374
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,049
Wh-What are you doing in there?

375
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,469
Just washed up in your sink.

376
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,099
Don't want to
offend the customers.

377
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,519
Why?

378
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,349
My dad's mad
'cause I bought a van,

379
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,019
and he's not letting
me use the house.

380
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,559
Oh. So that's your old
Chevy parked out front?

381
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,109
Pretty sweet, right?

382
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,359
You have a clean title on it?

383
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,779
Pretty much.

384
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,609
I think it's
registered in Mexico.

385
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,359
Well, that's something.

386
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,409
But it's got a bed
and a mini fridge.

387
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,369
Wow. Sweet.

388
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,539
I'm gonna hang
some twinkle lights

389
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,200
and maybe get a lava lamp.

390
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,709
Georgie, did I ever...

391
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,879
tell you why I got
married so young?

392
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,459
You were in love?

393
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,709
No, because,
when I was your age,

394
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,840
I bought a similar vehicle.

395
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,140
Cool. What was it?

396
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,219
Just get dressed.

397
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,220
Okay.

398
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,439
Paige,

399
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,479
look how close this
pushpin is to this balloon.

400
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,569
Mm-hmm.

401
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,109
It could pop at any moment.

402
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,569
I bet that drives you cra...

403
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,119
Hello.

404
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,239
What now? What now?

405
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,659
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

406
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,119
Are you just gonna repeat
everything I... Are you just gonna repeat

407
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,499
everything I say?

408
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,419
I, Sheldon Cooper...

409
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,420
accept Jesus Christ
as my Lord and Savior.

410
00:16:00,421 --> 00:16:02,919
Accept Jesus Chr...

411
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,929
Go get me a beer, woman.

412
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,509
What?

413
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,679
It infuriates my mom
when my dad says it.

414
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,269
Sheldon, stop.

415
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,309
You can't upset me. Why not?

416
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,479
Because there are things
in my life that are way worse

417
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,689
than anything that
you can come up with.

418
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,979
You mean your
parents splitting up.

419
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,280
Obviously.

420
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,279
I think I know
how to irritate you.

421
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,619
I bet you think the
divorce is all your fault

422
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,329
and now your family
is torn apart forever.

423
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,949
Did I do it?

424
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,870
Did I get under your skin?

425
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,959
I can still hear the sound
of her fist hitting your face

426
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,459
and your head
bouncing off the floor.

427
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,460
That is enough.

428
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,420
It was like, "Thwack,"

429
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:45,549
and then, "Kathunk."

430
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,089
I said enough!

431
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,179
And there were doughnut holes.

432
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,510
What a great day.

433
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,349
That night,
my brother turned a ratty old van

434
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,979
into his chariot of love.

435
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:12,489
Romance was in the air.

436
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,829
Hey. Oh. Hey, Mr. Boggs.

437
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,870
I-I'm just here to pick up Jana.

438
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,749
You think you're taking
my daughter out in this?

439
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,329
No worries. I'll have
her home by 11:00.

440
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,589
Ooh. I wouldn't open that.

441
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,550
Move.

442
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,729
It's got a mini fridge.

443
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,689
I thought about what you said.

444
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,229
I'm returning the
van. Good night.

445
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,069
This is the kind of weather

446
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,729
that makes you want to
stay at home.

447
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,240
If you don't have to go out today,
don't.

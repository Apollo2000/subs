he's going to California,

175
00:07:05,053 --> 00:07:07,561
I didn't see the point
in him knowing about it.

176
00:07:07,563 --> 00:07:09,563

181

This could be a huge
opportunity for him.

182
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,676
I should at least be told about it.

Well, you don't.

00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:33,222
He's not just your
son. He's my son, too.

188
00:07:34,396 --> 00:07:37,623
He didn't feel like your
son when he had chicken pox,

189
00:07:37,626 --> 00:07:40,189
or every morning when I
have to make his lunch.

190
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:42,359
Well, he felt like my son
when I took him to Caltech,

191
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,846
where he clearly
impressed a lot of people.

192
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:47,182
So you just want to
ship our baby boy off

193

to California to live by himself?

194
00:07:49,205 --> 00:07:52,205
I want to be included in
decisions about his future.

195
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,221
If that means California,
maybe I'll go with him.

196
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,024
He is not going anywhere.

197

00:00:01,966 --> 00:00:03,055
<i>Hello, Mrs. Cooper.</i>

3
00:00:03,139 --> 00:00:04,313
I just wanted to let you know,

4
00:00:04,397 --> 00:00:05,695
with Dr. Sturgis away,

5
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,220
I'll be available
should Sheldon need anything.

6
00:00:08,351 --> 00:00:09,632
<i>Now, I'm not terribly</i>

7
00:00:09,717 --> 00:00:11,062
experienced
around children.

8
00:00:11,147 --> 00:00:12,531
If he needs to use the restroom,

9
00:00:12,616 --> 00:00:14,592
I don't have to go in with him,
do I?

10
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:16,883
I don't need you to babysit me.

11
00:00:16,968 --> 00:00:18,638
I'm perfectly self-reliant.

12
00:00:18,723 --> 00:00:19,949
Then it's good
I kept the receipt

13
00:00:20,033 --> 00:00:22,504
for this bottle of bubbles
shaped like a bear.

14
00:00:23,036 --> 00:00:25,302
Welcome to the world
of philosophy.

15
00:00:25,386 --> 00:00:26,825
I'm going
to teach you

16
00:00:26,909 --> 00:00:29,442
that you don't even know
what you think you know.

17
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,308
Oh, boy.

18
00:00:31,551 --> 00:00:33,684
I'm not going to school.
Why not?

19
00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:35,575
Because I don't know
what's real.

20
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,090
Nothing matters.

21
00:00:38,741 --> 00:00:40,200
George?!

22
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:45,540
All right,

23
00:00:45,624 --> 00:00:46,628
what's the problem here?

24
00:00:46,712 --> 00:00:48,153
I don't know what's real.

25
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:50,249
That's a fun thing to think
about on the way to school.

26
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:51,599
Get up and get dressed.

27
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:53,069
Maybe I'm already dressed.

28
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,981
Maybe I'm wearing
a zoot suit and spats.

29
00:00:56,324 --> 00:00:58,778
That's a shoe covering that's
short for "spatterdasher."

30
00:00:58,907 --> 00:00:59,998
Or is it?

31
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,425
There's no way to know.

32
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:03,296
Here's what I know: I don't have
time for this nonsense.

33
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,689
What is time?

34
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:05,919
What is sense?

35
00:01:06,004 --> 00:01:07,481
What is "is"?

36
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:08,825
Sheldon, I mean it.

37
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,220
I remember
when things meant things.

38
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,437
All right, I'm gonna count
to three. One...

39
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:16,044
Believing in numbers...
That takes me back.

40
00:01:16,157 --> 00:01:18,099
- Two...
- To be or not to be.

41
00:01:18,184 --> 00:01:19,703
Shakespeare was onto something.

42
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,536
It's your last chance.

43
00:01:22,012 --> 00:01:23,534
Have you ever wondered
if you're the tongue

44
00:01:23,618 --> 00:01:25,902
of a multidimensional being
trying to taste something

45
00:01:25,987 --> 00:01:27,856
you can never even understand?

46
00:01:28,494 --> 00:01:30,017
I have.

47
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,840
I talked to him.

48
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,244
Where is your mother?

49
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:39,676
She had to leave for work.

50
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,030
I have to work, too.

51
00:01:41,114 --> 00:01:43,119
You also get to take me
to school.

52
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:44,860
What am I supposed to do
about your brother?

53
00:01:44,944 --> 00:01:46,122
Call me old-fashioned,

54
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,558
but I say spank him.

55
00:01:47,986 --> 00:01:49,509
Your mom won't let me.

Okay, I'm here.

00:02:10,753 --> 00:02:12,494
What's up?

65
00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:14,481
Sheldon won't get out of bed,
and I'm gonna be late for work.

66
00:02:14,565 --> 00:02:15,706
He's gonna be late
for school.

67
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,926
So you want me
to get him up and drive him?

68
00:02:18,064 --> 00:02:19,096
Yeah.

69
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:20,286
I like it better

70
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,634
when I just come eat your food
and leave.

71
00:02:24,026 --> 00:02:25,355
Hey, Moon Pie.

72
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,989
What's going on here?

73
00:02:27,073 --> 00:02:28,425
That's an excellent question.

74
00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:29,992
Too bad there's no answer.

75
00:02:30,076 --> 00:02:31,602
Well, you need
to get out of bed.

76
00:02:31,686 --> 00:02:33,432
I don't need to do anything.

77
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:34,997
Okay, I'm gonna count to three.

78
00:02:35,081 --> 00:02:36,799
Dad already counted to three.

79
00:02:36,884 --> 00:02:38,143
Oh.

80
00:02:38,954 --> 00:02:40,393
Did he try the Texas thing?

81
00:02:40,477 --> 00:02:41,481
No.

82
00:02:41,565 --> 00:02:43,096
In that case,

83
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,528
look at you,

84
00:02:44,612 --> 00:02:45,698
lyin' there.

85
00:02:45,783 --> 00:02:47,409
When a Texan gets
knocked off a horse,

86
00:02:47,494 --> 00:02:49,151
he gets right back on.

87
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:50,925
That is the second most
important thing

88
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,666
about bein' a Texan,

89
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:56,034
right after thinkin' you're
better than everybody else.

90
00:02:57,242 --> 00:02:59,199
Maybe the horse
gets back on the Texan.

91
00:02:59,284 --> 00:03:00,328
Who's to say?

92
00:03:01,794 --> 00:03:03,451
I don't know what that means.

93
00:03:03,535 --> 00:03:05,487
That's because
you can't know anything.

94
00:03:07,358 --> 00:03:09,112
If you need
to stare at the ceiling

95
00:03:09,197 --> 00:03:10,725
and contemplate
the futility of existence,

96
00:03:10,809 --> 00:03:12,838
Missy's bed is available.

97
00:03:15,956 --> 00:03:16,994
Amazing.

98
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,388
What is?

99
00:03:18,472 --> 00:03:21,086
I've been using this same pen
for seven months,

100
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,610
and it's still going.

101
00:03:22,694 --> 00:03:24,354
That's your bar for amazing?

102
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:26,002
Yeah.

103
00:03:26,217 --> 00:03:27,483
Sad.

104
00:03:27,568 --> 00:03:29,026
It's the same pen.

105
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,510
It is too early in the morning for you.

106
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:34,205
Hello.

107
00:03:34,662 --> 00:03:36,651
Yeah. I'll be down in a bit.

108
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:40,291
Where ya headed?

109
00:03:40,377 --> 00:03:41,803
Principal's office.

110
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:44,022
Ooh, you're in trouble...

111
00:03:44,106 --> 00:03:45,151
You're a child.

112
00:03:45,236 --> 00:03:47,630
I'd rather be a
child than in trouble.

113
00:03:49,149 --> 00:03:50,455
Shelly,

114
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,932
Dr. Sturgis is
on the line for you.

115
00:03:53,135 --> 00:03:54,729
Maybe he is,
maybe he isn't,

116
00:03:54,845 --> 00:03:56,206
but very well.

117
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,959
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, Sheldon.</i>

118
00:03:58,044 --> 00:04:01,442
I hear you're going through
some sort of existential crisis.

119
00:04:01,627 --> 00:04:03,096
I suppose so.

120
00:04:03,181 --> 00:04:05,534
I just don't know if we can tell
what's real or not.

121
00:04:05,691 --> 00:04:07,299
And if nothing's real,
I don't know

122
00:04:07,384 --> 00:04:09,807
what to think
or if I'm even thinking at all.

123
00:04:09,993 --> 00:04:12,557
I went through
something similar once.

124
00:04:12,883 --> 00:04:14,671
Really? What happened?

125
00:04:14,832 --> 00:04:17,565
I was trekking
through the Amazon,

126
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,786
and I saw two frogs,

127
00:04:19,972 --> 00:04:22,107
one hallucinogenic

128
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:23,721
and the other not.

129
00:04:23,817 --> 00:04:27,761
I tried to lick the normal one,

130
00:04:27,846 --> 00:04:29,154
<i>and, by mistake,</i>

131
00:04:29,238 --> 00:04:31,643
I licked the hallucinogenic one.

132
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:34,487
It really rocked my world.

133
00:04:34,572 --> 00:04:36,823
Why would you lick
either of them?

134
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:39,729
I'm not sure.
Probably low blood sugar.

135
00:04:39,814 --> 00:04:41,138
But the point is,

136
00:04:41,223 --> 00:04:43,750
I also lost track of reality.

137
00:04:43,835 --> 00:04:45,185
How did you handle it?

138
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,275
I saw a jaguar,

139
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,567
and I realized I didn't care
if it was real or not.

140
00:04:51,652 --> 00:04:54,739
I just hauled my tushy out
of there.

141
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,122
I appreciate the call.

142
00:04:56,207 --> 00:04:58,060
I'm giving you back
to my meemaw now.

143
00:04:58,419 --> 00:04:59,616
Bye!

144
00:05:02,873 --> 00:05:04,192
Hey, John,

145
00:05:04,277 --> 00:05:05,494
any luck?

146
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:08,437
Not unless you have access
to a jaguar.

147
00:05:08,522 --> 00:05:10,005
I don't think I do.

148
00:05:10,252 --> 00:05:12,786
Really, any jungle cat will do.

149
00:05:13,049 --> 00:05:14,489
Hey, Tom.

150
00:05:14,775 --> 00:05:16,040
George.

151
00:05:16,242 --> 00:05:17,681
Sheldon's not here anymore.

152
00:05:17,765 --> 00:05:18,983
Thought it'd be a while
before I got called back

153
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:20,547
into the principal's office.

154
00:05:20,855 --> 00:05:22,860
How's he doing?
I miss that kid.

155
00:05:23,075 --> 00:05:25,443
He took a philosophy class
and won't get out of bed

156
00:05:25,528 --> 00:05:27,530
'cause he doesn't know
what's real anymore.

157
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,713
Anyway, uh,

158
00:05:29,977 --> 00:05:31,504
we need to talk about Georgie.

159
00:05:32,013 --> 00:05:33,536
Should've seen that coming.

160
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,108
- What's wrong?
- Well,

161
00:05:35,193 --> 00:05:36,872
he's been cutting classes.

162
00:05:36,957 --> 00:05:37,874
Already?

163
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,224
Semester's barely started.

164
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,739
He's a go-getter.

00:05:40,832 --> 00:05:42,044
Mm.

166
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:44,388
I'll talk to him.Thanks.

167

How's the team looking
this year, George?

168
00:05:48,388 --> 00:05:51,404
We just had
one difficult conversation, Tom.

169
00:05:51,489 --> 00:05:53,216
Let's not have another.

171

wasn't able to acquire
a jungle cat,

172
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,117
the idea of tormenting a child
did tickle her Texan fancy.

173
00:06:02,201 --> 00:06:04,772
Sheldon.

174
00:06:06,553 --> 00:06:09,472
I have someone else
who wants to talk to you.

175
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,195
What are you doing
with that filthy thing?

176
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,911
Why do you care?

177
00:06:12,996 --> 00:06:14,389
If nothing is real,

178
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:16,627
then neither is the chicken.

179
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:20,482
Oh. Good.

180
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:22,708
We're standing now.
That's progress.

181
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,146
Get her out of here.

182
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:25,793
Well, I would, but...

183
00:06:25,877 --> 00:06:27,372
apparently,

184
00:06:27,457 --> 00:06:30,594
I can't know
what "here" is.

185
00:06:31,185 --> 00:06:32,724
So maybe I could just...

186
00:06:33,013 --> 00:06:34,396
set her on your bed.

187
00:06:34,481 --> 00:06:35,591
Okay! Okay.

188
00:06:35,676 --> 00:06:36,671
I'll get dressed.

189
00:06:36,756 --> 00:06:38,192

190
00:06:38,907 --> 00:06:41,522
This still doesn't solve
my existential crisis.

191
00:06:41,607 --> 00:06:43,450
Say what?
You want to hold her?

192
00:06:43,535 --> 00:06:45,061
No.

193
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,793

232
00:08:22,914 --> 00:08:25,307
Well, I don't know if I can
find it with my head up my ass.

233
00:08:27,296 --> 00:08:28,387
So,

234
00:08:28,471 --> 00:08:30,519
according to de Broglie,
lambda equals "h"

235
00:08:30,603 --> 00:08:32,059
divided by "m" times what?

236
00:08:32,551 --> 00:08:33,608
Sheldon.

237
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:35,013
Is it velocity?

238
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,083
Yes. Now...

239
00:08:36,168 --> 00:08:37,564
Or is it a velociraptor?

240
00:08:37,915 --> 00:08:39,006
I'm sorry?

241
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,008
Perhaps lambda
equals "h" divided

242
00:08:41,092 --> 00:08:42,836
by "m" times a velociraptor.

243
00:08:43,364 --> 00:08:45,317
Or a velveteen
rabbit.

244
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:46,579
Ooh, or Velveeta.

245
00:08:46,663 --> 00:08:48,233
That's the cheese
my mom puts on broccoli

246
00:08:48,317 --> 00:08:49,666
when she's being fancy.

247
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:52,533
Is this
from your philosophy class

248
00:08:52,664 --> 00:08:54,930
or perhaps that Ren & Stumpy
I've heard about?

249
00:08:55,038 --> 00:08:56,213
Philosophy.

250
00:08:57,295 --> 00:08:59,300
Mr. Cooper,
do you really believe

251
00:08:59,385 --> 00:09:02,005
that de Broglie's equation
contains Velveeta cheese?

252
00:09:02,113 --> 00:09:04,630
I don't know. Maybe he was just
trying to be fancy.

253
00:09:05,989 --> 00:09:07,120
Hello.

254
00:09:07,205 --> 00:09:08,372
Can I help you?

255
00:09:08,483 --> 00:09:10,200
Hi. I'm Connie Tucker.

256
00:09:10,285 --> 00:09:12,290
I'm Sheldon Cooper's
grandmother.

257
00:09:12,383 --> 00:09:14,919
Oh.
Nice to meet you.

258
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,216
He is a remarkable young man.

259
00:09:17,301 --> 00:09:20,873
Yes, he is. He's also
a very impressionable young man.

260
00:09:21,044 --> 00:09:23,876
Kind of like a lump of clay
with a bow tie.

261
00:09:24,395 --> 00:09:27,091
All I did was teach him
about epistemology.

262
00:09:27,176 --> 00:09:28,702
Whatever it is
you're teaching him,

263
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,794
it has made him
question everything.

264
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,101
That's the goal.

265
00:09:33,238 --> 00:09:35,506
Lady, I had to threaten him
with a chicken

266
00:09:35,591 --> 00:09:37,255
so he'd put his pants on.

267
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,215
I don't know
what's gotten into that kid.

268
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,609
He's allowed to not
want to play football.

269
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:44,788
Can you for once in your life
take my side, Wayne?

270
00:09:44,873 --> 00:09:46,921
Not my fault you're never right.

271
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,427
So you think it's okay
he just quits?

272
00:09:49,641 --> 00:09:51,599
He doesn't get
that much playing time.

273
00:09:52,816 --> 00:09:54,763
Well, in my family,
we don't quit.

274
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:57,928
Oh, I don't know. You quit
my book club pretty quick.

275
00:09:58,013 --> 00:09:59,692
I'm talking about football!

276
00:09:59,777 --> 00:10:01,966
Why is it so important
to you that he play?

277
00:10:02,388 --> 00:10:04,352
Are you sure you're a coach?

278
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,606
Team sports provides confidence,
leadership, discipline.

279
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,043
So does holding down a job,

280
00:10:10,224 --> 00:10:11,895
which he seems to shine at.

281
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,028
Let's just eat in silence.

282
00:10:15,505 --> 00:10:17,005
Fine.

283
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,505
I still think you should have
read The Color Purple.

284
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,999
We were bawling.

285
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:28,158
Although tasty, a brick
of cheese is not a number.

286
00:10:28,243 --> 00:10:30,481
Why are we still
talking about this?

287
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:32,145
Maybe we're not talking at all.

288
00:10:32,388 --> 00:10:34,379
Okay, that's enough for today.

289
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,826
Not your best lecture.

290
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,041
It's fairly normal
for first-time

291
00:10:39,126 --> 00:10:41,966
philosophy students
to have their worldviews shaken.

292
00:10:42,126 --> 00:10:43,565
Do they snap out of it?

293
00:10:43,864 --> 00:10:45,567
Well, you hope.

294
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,372
Professor Ericson,
I insist...

295
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:50,900
Hello, Connie.
What a pleasant surprise.

296
00:10:51,094 --> 00:10:52,359
Hey.

297
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,623
I'm sorry you're about to see me

298
00:10:53,707 --> 00:10:55,016
speak harshly to my colleague.

299
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,173
Have at it. Professor Ericson,

300
00:10:57,272 --> 00:10:58,615
I insist that you speak
to this young man

301
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,395
and explain to him
that reality is real,

302
00:11:00,546 --> 00:11:02,813
and it's possible
to know things as fact.

303
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:05,466
The class is called
"Introduction to Philosophy."

304
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:06,772
That's what I did.

305
00:11:06,887 --> 00:11:08,606
Well, un-introduce him.

306
00:11:08,691 --> 00:11:10,305
Yes, he's at this school
'cause of his brilliant

307
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:12,133
scientific mind,
and he spent my last class

308
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:14,049
talking about
processed cheese.

309
00:11:14,232 --> 00:11:15,410
Sheldon, is that true?

310
00:11:15,517 --> 00:11:16,782
Nothing's true.

311
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,337
You see what you've done?
You broke him.

312
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,356
Hey.

313
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:27,030
How come you didn't want
to get out of bed this morning?

314
00:11:27,488 --> 00:11:30,581
If I can't know what's real,
what's the point?

315
00:11:31,161 --> 00:11:33,044
You have the right words.

316
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:35,294
You're just saying them
wrong.

317
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:38,264
It's not,
"What's the point?"

318
00:11:38,388 --> 00:11:40,262
It's, "What's the point?"

319
00:11:41,044 --> 00:11:42,638
I don't understand.

320
00:11:42,723 --> 00:11:45,427
Asking these questions
is exciting.

321
00:11:45,986 --> 00:11:47,786
It's what gets me
out of bed.

322
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,731
That's interesting.

323
00:11:51,054 --> 00:11:52,349
Richard Feynman did say

324
00:11:52,434 --> 00:11:53,962
the greatest joy in life
is the pleasure of

325
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,528
finding things out.

326
00:11:55,755 --> 00:11:58,152

He's the physics guy, right?

327
00:11:58,237 --> 00:12:00,778
Yes. And your
perfume is beguiling.

328
00:12:01,856 --> 00:12:03,948
It's all making sense to me
now.

329
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:05,337
Thank you.

330
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,114
I am happy to help.

331
00:12:07,231 --> 00:12:09,285
Dr. Linkletter,
I'm dropping your class

332
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,070
and switching my major
to philosophy.

333
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,905
Uh, what?

334
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,326
It's funny. This morning,
I couldn't get out of bed,

335
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:23,325
and now I stand before a whole
new exciting field of study.

336
00:12:23,654 --> 00:12:26,878
Well, maybe instead
of making this big switch,

337
00:12:26,962 --> 00:12:28,341
you could study both.

338
00:12:28,426 --> 00:12:31,301
You could be
physics-philosophy guy.

339
00:12:31,386 --> 00:12:33,278
You sound like
a logical positivist.

340
00:12:33,363 --> 00:12:35,064
That's a branch of philosophy
that maintains

341
00:12:35,148 --> 00:12:37,349
the best way to philosophize
is through science.

342
00:12:37,434 --> 00:12:39,692
Well, there you go.
Do that.

343
00:12:40,003 --> 00:12:41,677
It may be too early
to specialize.

344
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:44,202
I've only been a philosopher
for 15 minutes.

345
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:48,200
Did you notice Dr. Linkletter
didn't look too thrilled

346
00:12:48,285 --> 00:12:49,770
about you leaving science?

347
00:12:49,855 --> 00:12:51,365
He never looks thrilled
about anything.

348
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:53,846
I think that's
just his face.

349
00:12:55,381 --> 00:12:57,169
That's the face.

350
00:13:01,953 --> 00:13:03,403
Why the hell weren't
you at practice?

351
00:13:03,488 --> 00:13:04,884
Can't talk right now.
I'm working.

352
00:13:04,969 --> 00:13:06,840
Well, you're gonna
talk about it.

353
00:13:07,943 --> 00:13:09,489
What do you want from me?

354
00:13:09,574 --> 00:13:11,724
I don't want to play football.
I want to work.

355
00:13:12,216 --> 00:13:14,639
You have your whole life
to hold down a job.

356
00:13:14,724 --> 00:13:16,411
Hey,
I like my job.

357
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,317
It's not my problem
you hate yours.

358
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:25,960

365
00:13:42,568 --> 00:13:44,822
I'm practicing the
philosophy of cynicism...

366
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,179
The ancient Greek view

367
00:13:46,264 --> 00:13:48,530
that the rules of society
should be ignored.

368
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:51,062
If you're gonna break rules,
you can do better than that.

369
00:13:51,147 --> 00:13:52,491
How?

370

<i>My arms are still sore.</i>

Is this where
I thought I'd end up? No.

403

Is this where
you thought you'd end up?

404
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:19,450
I thought I'd be working
at my father's funeral home

405
00:15:19,535 --> 00:15:21,018
sewing people's eyes shut.

406
00:15:21,103 --> 00:15:22,630
My life turned out great.

407
00:15:23,103 --> 00:15:24,612
Well, good for you.

408
00:15:26,095 --> 00:15:28,346

It's not work.

Honestly, I don't know

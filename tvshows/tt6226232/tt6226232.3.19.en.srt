1
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:05,350
Ice cream.

2
00:00:05,352 --> 00:00:07,111
Ice cream, Mom... can I?

3
00:00:07,114 --> 00:00:09,981
- Sure.
- Ice cream!

4
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:11,656
Don't you need money?

5
00:00:11,658 --> 00:00:12,825
I need money!

6
00:00:14,394 --> 00:00:16,261
- Thank you.
- Don't run!

7
00:00:16,263 --> 00:00:17,372
Okay!

8
00:00:18,598 --> 00:00:20,031
Shelly, you want ice cream?

9
00:00:20,033 --> 00:00:21,232
Ice cream!

10
00:00:21,234 --> 00:00:23,168
All right.

11
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,303
Here you go.

12
00:00:25,305 --> 00:00:26,437
And no runnin'.

13
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:28,590
In these loafers? Not a chance.

14
00:00:28,593 --> 00:00:30,074
I was jokin'.

15
00:00:30,076 --> 00:00:32,278
Okay.

16
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:34,434
It was turning out to be

17
00:00:34,437 --> 00:00:36,047
the perfect Saturday.

18
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,692
The ice cream man had extra napkins.

19
00:00:38,695 --> 00:00:40,301
I had tons of homework.

20
00:00:40,304 --> 00:00:43,223
And I was about to enjoy
an orange sherbet Push-Up,

21
00:00:43,226 --> 00:00:44,851
which was the only kind of Push-Up

22
00:00:44,854 --> 00:00:46,521
I could actually finish.

23
00:00:46,524 --> 00:00:49,184
Then it all came crashing down.

24
00:00:52,032 --> 00:00:53,879
There's no telling who
could buy that house!

25
00:00:53,882 --> 00:00:55,166
What if they have dogs?

26
00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:56,575
What if they have birds?

27
00:00:56,578 --> 00:00:58,035
What if they have both and the birds

28
00:00:58,038 --> 00:00:59,304
learned to bark like dogs?

29
00:00:59,307 --> 00:01:01,638
Sheldon, you're gettin'
yourself all worked up.

30
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:04,348
For good reason... that house
is six feet away from my bedroom

31
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:06,895
window... who knows what kind
of smells could jump the gap?

32
00:01:06,898 --> 00:01:10,648
Uh, cigarette smoke, a
scented candle, a durian?

33
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,849
What's a durian?

34
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:14,461
A vile-smelling fruit
of the genus Durio.

35
00:01:14,464 --> 00:01:15,762
When did you smell that?

36
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:18,056
I haven't, and I'd like
to keep it that way.

37
00:01:18,058 --> 00:01:19,324
It might be nice.

38
00:01:19,326 --> 00:01:22,020
It might be a family with kids your age.

39
00:01:22,023 --> 00:01:24,939
I already live with a
kid my age... not a fan!

40
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:43,647

41
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,785
What's up?

42
00:01:47,787 --> 00:01:50,188
Can I talk to you about
serious woman stuff?

43
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,904
Of course.

44
00:01:51,907 --> 00:01:54,692
Is this a... iced tea conversation

45
00:01:54,694 --> 00:01:56,994
or a hot tea conversation?

46
00:01:56,996 --> 00:01:59,230
Definitely hot.

47
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:01,933
Uh-oh.

48
00:02:01,935 --> 00:02:03,301
So what's goin' on?

49
00:02:04,571 --> 00:02:06,938
I think I have a boyfriend.

50
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,973
Wow.

51
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:10,657
But you cannot tell Mom.

52
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,061
Oh, of course... I love not
telling your mother stuff.

53
00:02:14,064 --> 00:02:16,170
So what-what-what's his name?

54
00:02:16,173 --> 00:02:18,416
Marcus Adam Larson, he's 11 and a half,

55
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:20,877
he has blond hair, his
favorite color's green

56
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,446
and he's learning how to skateboard,

57
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:24,014
but he's not very good yet.

58
00:02:24,017 --> 00:02:26,560
Okay, well, I have to ask, now...

59
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,131
at your age, having a
boyfriend, what does that mean?

60
00:02:29,134 --> 00:02:32,163
Do you, uh... go out on dates?

61
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:33,398
No.

62
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,001
Um... well, d-do you hold hands?

63
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:38,971
I wish, but no.

64
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,173
So how do you know he's your boyfriend?

65
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:43,575
Because this happened.

66
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,842
_

67
00:02:48,845 --> 00:02:50,139
Wow.

68
00:02:50,142 --> 00:02:52,383
I didn't realize you had documentation.

69
00:02:52,385 --> 00:02:54,064
I know.

70
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:10,301
Something suspicious
is happening next door.

71
00:03:10,303 --> 00:03:11,478
Like what?

72
00:03:11,481 --> 00:03:13,948
Groups of strangers
keep coming and going.

73
00:03:13,951 --> 00:03:16,318
They must be using the
house to sell drugs.

74
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,976
No one's selling drugs, they're
just havin' an open house.

75
00:03:18,978 --> 00:03:20,144
What's that?

76
00:03:20,146 --> 00:03:22,359
They open up the house
so people interested

77
00:03:22,362 --> 00:03:23,576
in buyin' it can take a look.

78
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:26,685
That explains why 911 hung up on me.

79
00:03:31,224 --> 00:03:33,691
I had no choice but to determine

80
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:36,092
if any of these prospective home buyers

81
00:03:36,095 --> 00:03:38,053
would be suitable neighbors.

82
00:03:38,056 --> 00:03:39,696
This shifty fellow?

83
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:41,299
He looks like trouble.

84
00:03:41,301 --> 00:03:42,533
That woman and

85
00:03:42,535 --> 00:03:45,256
whatever dark secret
is hiding in her bag?

86
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,302
Probably a machete.

87
00:03:47,305 --> 00:03:50,873
Oh, this lady seems promising.

88
00:03:56,832 --> 00:03:58,485
Not on my watch.

89
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,752
Please look around.

90
00:03:59,755 --> 00:04:01,222
If you have any questions,
I'll be right here.

91
00:04:01,224 --> 00:04:03,120
Excuse me, is there
someone in charge here?

92
00:04:03,122 --> 00:04:05,036
That would be me.

93
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,272
Mr. Lundy?

94
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:07,412
What are you doing here?

95
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:09,251
I'm the realtor.

96
00:04:09,254 --> 00:04:11,889
But you're a teacher and an actor.

97
00:04:11,892 --> 00:04:14,998
And while those both pay so well,

98
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:17,842
I like to do this on
the weekends for fun.

99
00:04:17,845 --> 00:04:19,470
Why are you here?

100
00:04:19,472 --> 00:04:20,838
I live next door and I'm concerned

101
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,600
about who the new neighbor might be.

102
00:04:22,603 --> 00:04:26,051
Don't you worry, I will
personally make sure that

103
00:04:26,054 --> 00:04:29,413
your new neighbor is whoever
forks over the most money.

104
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:30,448
Thank you.

105
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,516
Wait.

106
00:04:31,518 --> 00:04:33,851
So if you want to be his girlfriend

107
00:04:33,853 --> 00:04:36,587
and he wants to be your boyfriend,

108
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:38,693
what's the problem?

109
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:41,864
He also plays baseball,
and this weekend...

110
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:43,995
I have to pitch against him.

111
00:04:43,997 --> 00:04:45,563
Yeah, so?

112
00:04:45,565 --> 00:04:49,021
So if I strike him out, he might
get mad and break up with me.

113
00:04:49,024 --> 00:04:51,020
Well, why would he do that?

114
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:52,637
I've struck out a bunch of boys.

115
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,105
They all get real mad.

116
00:04:54,107 --> 00:04:57,508
You're gonna pitch
bad to him on purpose?

117
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,328
I was thinkin' about it.

118
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:01,178
That is not what you are gonna do.

119
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:03,879
You are gonna do your best,
and if you strike him out,

120
00:05:03,882 --> 00:05:05,449
he will respect you for it.

121
00:05:05,451 --> 00:05:06,717
I don't know.

122
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:09,292
When I struck out
Brian Morgan, he cried.

123
00:05:09,295 --> 00:05:11,895
Now everyone calls him Cryin' Brian.

124
00:05:11,898 --> 00:05:13,090
That's pretty funny.

125
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:14,488
Thanks, I started it.

126
00:05:18,031 --> 00:05:19,530
Mr. Lundy?

127
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:20,831
Come in.

128
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,328
What brings you here?

129
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:24,535
I'm the listing agent
on the house next door.

130
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:26,468
But I thought you
were a teacher and a...

131
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:28,504
And an actor, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

132
00:05:28,507 --> 00:05:31,528
You've got to get your
son out of my open house.

133
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,010
Why, what's he doin'?

134
00:05:33,012 --> 00:05:34,278
Well...

135
00:05:36,482 --> 00:05:38,176
I noticed there's hair on your coat.

136
00:05:38,179 --> 00:05:39,517
Clearly yours is falling out,

137
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,918
but do you also have pets?

138
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:45,432
I detect a hint of garlic.

139
00:05:45,435 --> 00:05:47,301
Do you enjoy cooking stinky foods

140
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:48,826
or are you afraid of vampires?

141
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,663
Is there any chance you're just fat?

142
00:05:55,501 --> 00:05:57,435
Oh, dear, I'll go get him.

143
00:05:57,437 --> 00:05:59,037
Thank you.

144
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:02,506
Kind of a dump.

145
00:06:02,508 --> 00:06:03,998
But I could sell it.

146
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:12,722
Why are you reading about property code?

147
00:06:12,724 --> 00:06:14,739
The house next door to mine is for sale,

148
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:17,394
and I'm looking for ways to
control who moves in there.

149
00:06:17,396 --> 00:06:20,897
When my family moved to Texas,
they burned our fishing boat.

150
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:23,300
Tam, we're talking about
my problems right now.

151
00:06:23,302 --> 00:06:24,901
We usually are.

152
00:06:24,903 --> 00:06:26,803
Ooh, listen to this: "A seller

153
00:06:26,805 --> 00:06:28,891
or seller's agent must
disclose if a homicide

154
00:06:28,894 --> 00:06:30,407
has occurred on the property."

155
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:31,808
Why is that helpful?

156
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,010
That could scare off
any unwanted buyers.

157
00:06:34,012 --> 00:06:36,112
Has there ever been a murder next door?

158
00:06:36,114 --> 00:06:38,015
I sure hope so.

159
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:40,448
Hello, Officer Robin.

160
00:06:40,451 --> 00:06:41,852
This is Sheldon Cooper.

161
00:06:41,854 --> 00:06:43,153
What's wrong, Sheldon?

162
00:06:43,155 --> 00:06:44,654
I was wondering if anyone was murdered

163
00:06:44,656 --> 00:06:46,489
in the house next door to mine.

164
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:48,503
You mean murdered today?

165
00:06:48,506 --> 00:06:50,861
No, ever, but today would work, too.

166
00:06:50,863 --> 00:06:53,630
It'll take me a while to check.

167
00:06:53,632 --> 00:06:54,998
That's fine, I can hold.

168
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,500
Tell Mr. Givens I may be
a little late to class.

169
00:06:57,502 --> 00:06:59,097
It's a police matter.

170
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,470
Sheldon's gonna be late.

171
00:07:00,472 --> 00:07:01,605
Well, all right!

172
00:07:01,607 --> 00:07:04,407
- It's a police ma...
- Don't care.

173
00:07:04,409 --> 00:07:05,675
Yes, I'm still here.

174
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:07,077
Sorry, no murders.

175
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:09,558
Just one death from natural causes in

176
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:10,947
1948.

177
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:13,083
How can we be sure it wasn't foul play?

178
00:07:13,085 --> 00:07:15,407
The man was 96 years old, Sheldon.

179
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,387
That's a lot of years to make enemies.

180
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:18,488
Bye.

181
00:07:20,425 --> 00:07:22,902
So,

182
00:07:22,905 --> 00:07:24,628
you playin' the Tigers on Saturday?

183
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,830
Should be an easy win.

184
00:07:26,832 --> 00:07:29,399
Their best player's parents
are getting a divorce.

185
00:07:29,401 --> 00:07:31,167
He's pretty distracted.

186
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:32,869
Well, there's a lucky break.

187
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:36,339
I just hope it drags
out through playoffs.

188
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:38,608
So how you feel about

189
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,777
not pitchin' Missy?

190
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:42,545
Why would I do that?

191
00:07:42,547 --> 00:07:45,348
Well, she's growin' up

192
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,285
and she's going through
some new stuff...

193
00:07:48,287 --> 00:07:50,230
Oh, I don't want to hear about that.

194
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:51,554
No, no, no, she's...

195
00:07:51,556 --> 00:07:54,493
she's got a crush on a
boy on the other team,

196
00:07:54,496 --> 00:07:56,993
and she's worried that
if she strikes him out,

197
00:07:56,995 --> 00:07:58,628
that it will embarrass him.

198
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,563
Well, that's too bad, she's our pitcher.

199
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:01,965
She's gonna do her job.

200
00:08:01,967 --> 00:08:05,485
Well, she's also an 11-year-old
girl with big feelings.

201
00:08:05,488 --> 00:08:08,774
And I'm a cranky old
man with no feelings.

202
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:14,649
Well, I've always thought that
underneath that tough exterior,

203
00:08:14,652 --> 00:08:17,882
there was a shred of compassion.

204
00:08:20,619 --> 00:08:22,352
Yeah, I know what you're doing.

205
00:08:22,354 --> 00:08:23,887
What am I doing?

206
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:27,223
You're using your feminine
wiles to get your way.

207
00:08:27,225 --> 00:08:28,491
Mm-mm-mm.

208
00:08:28,493 --> 00:08:30,328
Smart and handsome.

209
00:08:31,363 --> 00:08:33,925
You forgot tall.

210
00:08:33,928 --> 00:08:35,961
Don't say that.

211
00:08:35,964 --> 00:08:39,422
Never... say that.

212
00:08:39,425 --> 00:08:42,238
Goonies...

213
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,910
never say die.

214
00:08:47,512 --> 00:08:49,279
Well done.

215
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:51,481
Very moving.

216
00:08:51,483 --> 00:08:53,483
And speaking of moving,

217
00:08:53,485 --> 00:08:56,319
if any of your parents are in
the market for a two-bedroom,

218
00:08:56,321 --> 00:08:59,680
two-bath ranch-style
with a updated kitchen,

219
00:08:59,683 --> 00:09:01,691
have them give me a call.

220
00:09:03,616 --> 00:09:05,294
All right, very good.

221
00:09:05,297 --> 00:09:08,477
How about next week we try some
monologues from actual theater?

222
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,766
Just a thought.

223
00:09:09,768 --> 00:09:11,292
Mr. Lundy.

224
00:09:11,295 --> 00:09:12,610
Oh, what now?

225
00:09:12,613 --> 00:09:13,817
What happened with the open house

226
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,573
after you had me kicked out?
Were there any potential buyers?

227
00:09:16,575 --> 00:09:18,341
And if so, can I have
their names so I can run

228
00:09:18,343 --> 00:09:20,543
a background check
with my friends in blue?

229
00:09:20,545 --> 00:09:23,513
Sheldon, if you think you're gonna

230
00:09:23,515 --> 00:09:27,617
stop me from selling
this house, you're wrong.

231
00:09:27,619 --> 00:09:29,119
Oh, am I?

232
00:09:29,121 --> 00:09:32,188
They tried to stop me
from staging The Crucible

233
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:34,057
on roller skates.

234
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:37,827
A lot of understudies
went on that day...

235
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:40,464
but so did the show.

236
00:09:42,434 --> 00:09:44,634
You do not want me as an enemy.

237
00:09:44,636 --> 00:09:47,604
Or as a friend, sibling
or student, I've been told.

238
00:09:47,606 --> 00:09:49,368
All right, look, if
it's so important to you,

239
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:50,540
why don't you just go out

240
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:53,073
and find a buyer that
you'd be happy with?

241
00:09:53,076 --> 00:09:55,844
So if I find someone I deem acceptable,

242
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:57,680
you'd sell them the house?

243
00:09:57,682 --> 00:10:00,617
If the bank approves, so do I.

244
00:10:00,619 --> 00:10:02,619
Excellent.

245
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:04,821
I wonder if Stephen
Hawking would like Texas.

246
00:10:04,823 --> 00:10:06,189
It's very flat.

247
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:09,055
Oh, I can't afford a house,

248
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:11,261
but I'm flattered
you'd want me next door.

249
00:10:11,263 --> 00:10:13,029
Of course I would. You
don't have enough friends

250
00:10:13,031 --> 00:10:14,231
to throw a party.

251
00:10:15,033 --> 00:10:17,634
Yeah, well...

252
00:10:17,636 --> 00:10:19,969
Neither-neither do you!

253
00:10:19,971 --> 00:10:23,006
So, you think after seeing
you every day at school,

254
00:10:23,008 --> 00:10:25,842
I'd want to go home, look out my window

255
00:10:25,844 --> 00:10:28,566
and see-see more of you?

256
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:29,902
Yes.

257
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:32,182
Hey, maybe we could
ride to school together.

258
00:10:32,184 --> 00:10:33,610
We could play car games.

259
00:10:33,613 --> 00:10:35,885
Stop, you're killing me.

260
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:38,922
I'm sorry, why would I want
to live next door to you?

261
00:10:38,924 --> 00:10:40,102
Ask Mr. Givens.

262
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:43,026
Apparently, I'm hilarious.

263
00:10:43,028 --> 00:10:44,883
That's sweet of you for asking,

264
00:10:44,886 --> 00:10:45,895
but I'd rather

265
00:10:45,897 --> 00:10:48,164
stick my finger in a pencil sharpener

266
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,934
and crank away.

267
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:52,777
I would love to, Sheldon,

268
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,536
but there's a district rule

269
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:57,474
that says a principal can't
live next door to a student.

270
00:10:57,476 --> 00:10:59,008
That makes sense.

271
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,345
Does it? Good.

272
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:06,480
Hey. Robin says the house

273
00:11:06,483 --> 00:11:08,118
next door to y'all is for sale.

274
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,886
Oh, yeah, it is.

275
00:11:09,888 --> 00:11:11,488
Is it nice?

276
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,493
Uh... nice enough.

277
00:11:14,496 --> 00:11:16,259
Why? Are you thinking about moving?

278
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:19,095
I wasn't, but Robin's not
crazy about living in a house

279
00:11:19,097 --> 00:11:20,697
I shared with my ex-wife.

280
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:22,198
That's understandable.

281
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,480
I want her to be happy.
'Cause I love her.

282
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,516
Not just 'cause she's a cop with a gun.

283
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,253
- But that's part of it.
- Well,

284
00:11:28,256 --> 00:11:31,273
I'm sure there are lots of
wonderful houses out there.

285
00:11:31,276 --> 00:11:33,276
I'd be happy to help you look.

286
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:36,746
Do you not want us to look
at the one next to you?

287
00:11:36,748 --> 00:11:38,828
Oh, no, of course not.

288
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,017
You should absolutely look at it.

289
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:43,052
As well as other houses.

290
00:11:43,054 --> 00:11:46,689
I have to say, this isn't
the reaction I was expecting.

291
00:11:46,691 --> 00:11:50,055
No, it is the reaction
you were expecting.

292
00:11:50,058 --> 00:11:54,497
Excited that my boss
might live next door to me.

293
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:56,065
Yay!

294
00:11:56,067 --> 00:11:58,301
Well, my boss lives everywhere,

295
00:11:58,303 --> 00:12:00,938
and you don't see me
getting weird about it.

296
00:12:05,942 --> 00:12:07,950
And then after you buy
the house, you rent it out

297
00:12:07,953 --> 00:12:09,655
to people who are preapproved by me.

298
00:12:09,658 --> 00:12:11,684
- I can't afford a second house.
- Georgie,

299
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:13,960
you make as much money as
Dad. Why don't you buy it?

300
00:12:13,962 --> 00:12:15,929
He does not make as much money as me.

301
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:17,998
No. But I don't have to spend mine

302
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,133
on stupid stuff like food and kids.

303
00:12:20,135 --> 00:12:21,501
Mary, where's dinner?

304
00:12:21,503 --> 00:12:23,637
So, is that a yes to buying the house?

305
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:26,373
Sorry. When I move out, it
ain't gonna be 20 feet away,

306
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,241
and it's got to have a hot tub.

307
00:12:28,243 --> 00:12:29,442
Sheldon, you need

308
00:12:29,444 --> 00:12:31,470
to stop involving yourself in this.

309
00:12:31,473 --> 00:12:32,812
You upset Mr. Lundy,

310
00:12:32,814 --> 00:12:34,981
and you were rude to the
people at the open house.

311
00:12:34,983 --> 00:12:37,263
And he was bugging his
teachers at school all day.

312
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:39,218
But Mr. Lundy said I could help him.

313
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:40,620
I don't care.

314
00:12:40,622 --> 00:12:43,423
Even Pastor Jeff is talking
about buying that house now.

315
00:12:43,425 --> 00:12:44,691
That could work out.

316
00:12:44,693 --> 00:12:47,510
His wife's a police officer,
so built-in security.

317
00:12:47,513 --> 00:12:49,562
And whenever I have
a theological zinger,

318
00:12:49,564 --> 00:12:51,131
I can call it right over the fence.

319
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:53,600
You want your boss living next door?

320
00:12:53,602 --> 00:12:55,135
Not exactly.

321
00:12:55,138 --> 00:12:56,341
You don't have to worry

322
00:12:56,344 --> 00:12:58,338
about your boss. There's
a district rule that says

323
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,908
that Principal Petersen
cannot live next door to me.

324
00:13:01,643 --> 00:13:03,209
That sounds made-up.

325
00:13:03,211 --> 00:13:05,041
A principal who tells lies.

326
00:13:05,044 --> 00:13:07,015
What are we gonna do with this one?

327
00:13:12,754 --> 00:13:14,575
Here's the payroll checks.

328
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:16,345
- Thank you.
- If you need anything else,

329
00:13:16,348 --> 00:13:18,992
I'll be in my office,
which is next door.

330
00:13:18,994 --> 00:13:21,829
Sorry it's so close.

331
00:13:23,872 --> 00:13:26,306
Lord, I am trying my best.

332
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:28,568
Please help me with this situation.

333
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,771
Amen.

334
00:13:32,614 --> 00:13:34,306
_

335
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:37,020
I meant fix him, not me.

336
00:13:38,647 --> 00:13:40,313
Excuse me,

337
00:13:40,315 --> 00:13:42,919
Mr. Lundy. I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

338
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,838
Oh. What's going on?

339
00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:48,556
My mother has forbidden me
from helping you sell the house.

340
00:13:50,358 --> 00:13:51,858
That...

341
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:55,128
is beyond bad news.

342
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,797
I don't think I can do this alone.

343
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,432
I'm sorry. It's not me.

344
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:02,169
No, I know it's not.

345
00:14:03,338 --> 00:14:06,539
Just enjoyed being in
the trenches with you.

346
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,774
As did I.

347
00:14:07,776 --> 00:14:10,410
All right, Sheldon, I...

348
00:14:10,412 --> 00:14:13,046
I guess I'll see you in the halls.

349
00:14:13,048 --> 00:14:14,749
Again, I'm sorry.

350
00:14:15,584 --> 00:14:17,785
Me, too.

351
00:14:21,123 --> 00:14:24,291
And scene.

352
00:14:40,575 --> 00:14:42,842
Hey, uh, Cooper,

353
00:14:42,844 --> 00:14:45,245
you know, I think I'm gonna
have you sit this one out

354
00:14:45,248 --> 00:14:46,767
and let Powell pitch.

355
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,915
- Really?
- Yeah.

356
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:51,651
Kind of like to save your
arm for the playoffs, okay?

357
00:14:51,653 --> 00:14:53,520
Okay.

358
00:14:53,522 --> 00:14:55,455
Do you want to save my arm, too?

359
00:14:55,457 --> 00:14:56,656
No.

360
00:14:56,658 --> 00:14:58,158
How about my legs?

361
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,594
You know, Billy, you never
fail to brighten my day.

362
00:15:01,596 --> 00:15:03,329
Cool.

363
00:15:03,331 --> 00:15:05,598
Pastor Jeff, you got a second?

364
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,333
Of course.

365
00:15:07,336 --> 00:15:09,102
I might've called before dropping in,

366
00:15:09,104 --> 00:15:11,305
but that's just how I was raised.

367
00:15:13,341 --> 00:15:15,842
I owe you an apology.

368
00:15:15,844 --> 00:15:18,244
I was worried about us

369
00:15:18,246 --> 00:15:19,279
working together

370
00:15:19,281 --> 00:15:21,815
and then living next door to each other,

371
00:15:21,817 --> 00:15:26,049
but I like you and Robin very much,

372
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:28,439
and if you want to look into that house,

373
00:15:28,442 --> 00:15:32,026
we would be lucky to
have you as neighbors.

374
00:15:32,828 --> 00:15:35,829
Thank you. That's nice to hear.

375
00:15:35,831 --> 00:15:37,263
I mean it.

376
00:15:37,265 --> 00:15:39,199
Good, 'cause Robin already
looked at it, loved it,

377
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:42,036
put up police tape so
no one else could get in.

378
00:15:43,538 --> 00:15:45,372
Okay.

379
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,340
Ball four.

380
00:15:47,343 --> 00:15:49,256
Oh, damn it.

381
00:15:57,312 --> 00:15:59,072
We're gonna lose.

382
00:15:59,075 --> 00:16:00,420
Oh, we're gonna be fine.

383
00:16:00,423 --> 00:16:02,023
Powell's got this.

384
00:16:02,858 --> 00:16:04,457
I'll strike Marcus out.

385
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:06,160
Put me in.

386
00:16:07,981 --> 00:16:09,183
Time!

387
00:16:09,264 --> 00:16:10,730
Time!

388
00:16:10,732 --> 00:16:12,765
I thought Marcus was your boyfriend.

389
00:16:12,768 --> 00:16:14,463
Meemaw told you?

390
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:17,400
She's my girlfriend. You
know, we talk about stuff.

391
00:16:17,403 --> 00:16:20,840
So, all that about saving my
arm for playoffs wasn't true?

392
00:16:20,842 --> 00:16:22,103
I was just being nice.

393
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,643
Since when are you nice?

394
00:16:23,645 --> 00:16:24,978
Well, don't get used to it.

395
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,314
Just go strike out your boyfriend.

396
00:16:28,617 --> 00:16:29,889
Player change!

397
00:16:29,892 --> 00:16:31,860
Come on, Cooper.

398
00:16:33,154 --> 00:16:34,420
Good job.

399
00:16:34,422 --> 00:16:36,257
Kind of.

400
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:46,699
Strike one!

401
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:48,601
Yes! Two more, Coop!

402
00:16:48,603 --> 00:16:50,136
Two more! Come on.

403
00:16:50,138 --> 00:16:52,317
I thought we were saving her arm.

404
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,021
- Not now, Billy.
- Okay.

405
00:17:02,976 --> 00:17:04,884
- Foul ball!
- Yeah, okay!

406
00:17:04,886 --> 00:17:06,085
You got this!

407
00:17:06,087 --> 00:17:07,941
- Strike two.
- Hang in there!

408
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,622
No coddle. Come on, Coop.

409
00:17:09,624 --> 00:17:11,825
Bear down.

410
00:17:22,704 --> 00:17:24,904
- Strike three!
- Yeah!

411
00:17:24,906 --> 00:17:26,472
- You're out!
- That's my girl!

412
00:17:26,474 --> 00:17:28,175
Yeah!

413
00:17:34,816 --> 00:17:36,082
- Good job!
- Way to go!

414
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:40,404
We won!

415
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:41,955
Good game. Good game.

416
00:17:41,957 --> 00:17:43,222
Good game. Good game.

417
00:17:43,224 --> 00:17:44,824
Good game. Good game. Good game.

418
00:17:44,872 --> 00:17:46,806
Good game. Good game. Good game.

419
00:17:52,874 --> 00:17:55,309
Good game.

420
00:17:56,338 --> 00:17:57,838
Good game.

421
00:18:08,116 --> 00:18:09,647
Where the hell is she going?

422
00:18:11,987 --> 00:18:13,920
Missy! Where you going?

423
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,833
He held my hand!

424
00:18:26,835 --> 00:18:28,902
- High five!
- Don't touch it!

425
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,910
We've got some exciting news.

426
00:18:37,912 --> 00:18:39,779
They accepted our offer on the house!

427
00:18:39,781 --> 00:18:41,013
We're gonna be neighbors.

428
00:18:41,015 --> 00:18:42,749
That's wonderful.

429
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:45,218
Come in, come in.

430
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,742
What's going on?

431
00:18:46,745 --> 00:18:48,699
It looks like Pastor Jeff and Robin

432
00:18:48,702 --> 00:18:50,323
are gonna move in next door.

433
00:18:50,325 --> 00:18:51,791
And that's not the only news.

434
00:18:51,793 --> 00:18:53,059
We're expecting.

435
00:18:53,061 --> 00:18:54,269
Oh!

436
00:18:54,272 --> 00:18:56,094
What a beautiful blessing!

437
00:18:56,097 --> 00:18:59,333
Hey, Sheldon, maybe someday
you can babysit for us.

438
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:04,571
♪ Rock-a-bye, baby. ♪

439
00:19:07,075 --> 00:19:10,109
- Where you going?
- To apply for college.

440
00:19:10,111 --> 00:19:12,111
When he sees the baby,
he'll come around.

441
00:19:12,113 --> 00:19:14,245
No, I won't.

442
00:19:16,535 --> 00:19:22,495

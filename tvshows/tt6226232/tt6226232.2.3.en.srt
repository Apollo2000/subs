1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:05,510
"That everyone who believes
may have eternal life in here.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:11,310
For God so loved the world that
he gave his one and only son

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,050
Here we go.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,620
Yes, Sheldon?

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,950
When you said God gave his son to the world

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,890
did you mean Earth or the Universe.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,090
Earth.

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,990
But if God created the universe,

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,560
wouldn't he want to save all of it?

10
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,930
Yes, uh, he would.

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,830
Then why did you say Earth?

12
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,630
"Earth" is a synonym for the universe.

13
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,370
He is grabbing his straws now.

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,470
So if Gods plan is to
save all of the Universe

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,210
that means a race of Octopus
Aliens light years away

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,910
could only be saved by Jesus?

17
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,380
Sure.

18
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,050
- Even though they never heard of him.
- Yes.

19
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,380
Even though his appearance
might be terrifying to them.

20
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,350
W-Why would his appearance be terrifying?

21
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,920
He has four limbs and they have eight.

22
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,950
- Okay, thats enough.
- No, no.

23
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,120
I prayed people would be more
interested in my sermons

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,360
I suppose I should've been more specific.

25
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,650
Sheldon, if these creatures...

26
00:01:00,651 --> 00:01:04,360
were born without sin, they don't
need to be saved by Jesus.

27
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,100
What if an octopus Adam and Eve
brought sin to their world.

28
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,640
Would they be saved by a human Jesus
or an Octopus Jesus.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,074

31
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,160
And then I said octopus aliens
didn't need to become Christian

32
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,530
because theyre not
affected by regional sin

33
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,040
You shouldve been there;
Pastor Jeff almost started crying.

34
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,940
Oh, now Im sorry
I've missed it.

35
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,970
Thats your fault for
having a hangover.

36
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,710
Or its Gods fault for
putting Sunday morning

37
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,310
after Saturday night.

38
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,050
- Meemaw, could you take me to Radio Shack.
- Hello?

39
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,420
Sure, maybe later.

40
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,650
Laters a little vague.

41
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,220
Could you please be more specific.

42
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,690
When Im good and ready.
How is that?

43
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,560
Better, but I'd really
like to note this down.

44
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,130
Why dont you ask your
father to take you.

45
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,700
- Dad?
- What?

46
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,500
Can you please take me to Radio Shack?

47
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,170
Im busy. Ask your Meemaw.

48
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,170
I did. She said to ask you.

49
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,300
Well, ask her again.

50
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,440
Seems counterintuitive, but allright.

51
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,010
Meemaw?

52
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,140
Oh, Lord.

53
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,980
Everything okay?

54
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,710
No.

55
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,480
Stephanie Hansons daughter
was in car accident last night.

56
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,510
She died.

57
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,420
Oh, no.

58
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,590
My God.

59
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,190
She was barely 16.

60
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,990
That is horrible.

61
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,330
Is there anything we can do?

62
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,130
I dont know.

63
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,400
Um... ugh.

64
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,230
I need to call folks at the Church.

65
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,440
Any more thoughts on Radio Shack.

66
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,200
Sheldon, do you really think...

67
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,540
this is the appropriate
time to ask that question?

68
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,610
I did, but now I'm second guessing myself.

69
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,090
How you holding up?

70
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,560
Im okay.

71
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,130
16 years old.

72
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,130
Its just awful.

73
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,600
Its all part of Gods plan.

74
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,480
How come we dont get to go to the funeral?

75
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,480
Why would you want to go to a funeral?

76
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,550
I've never been to one.

77
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,560
When you get to be my age,
you'd get to to go plenty.

78
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,690
Thats, like, a hundred
years from now.

79
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,730
You make it hard to love you.

80
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,260
Do you really see a dead body?

81
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,800
Sometimes.

82
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,470
How close do you get to it?

83
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,270
Real close, if you want.

84
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,770
And the clothes theyre wearing,

85
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,140
is that the clothes the become ghost in.

86
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,710
Depends. In the movie Ghost,

87
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,380
Patrick Swayze has on...

88
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,780
Casper runs around butt naked.

89
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,650
Maybe he died naked.

90
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,790
Thats fun to think about.

91
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,650
And yall wonder why you're
not at the funeral.

92
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,260
Good morning, Peg.

93
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:26,300
Well, it will be once this
cup sank word its magic.

94
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,570
Is Pastor available?

95
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,700
Oh, he is on the phone with his wife.

96
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,200
- Oh, should I come back?
- Nah.

97
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,740
He usually gets his groveling
down pretty quick.

98
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:40,610
So... that little Hanson girl,
that was horrible.

99
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,620
Yeah.

100
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,820
Reminds you that...

101
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,490
life is precious.

102
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,330
Youre up, slugger.

103
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,730
Come in.

104
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,140
I have the clothing drive flyers
If you'd like to take look.

105
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,640
Thank you.

106
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,910
You all right, Mare?

107
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,250
No, not really.

108
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,650
Um... I cant stop thinking
about that little girl.

109
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,260
I understand.

110
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,260
Thats why its important in these times

111
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,360
to take comfort in our faith.

112
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,200
What if thats not doing the trick.

113
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,540
Events like this
can certainly create doubt.

114
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,310
It happens to me more often
than I'd like to admit.

115
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,610
What do you do?

116
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:48,580
I roll up my sleeves and I work
even harder at serving our Lord.

117
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,380
Mary, we each have a relationship with God.

118
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,350
and relationships take work.

119
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,190
Get out there.

120
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,360
Help the needy, start a Bible study,

121
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,760
hug a stranger and tell em
Lord loves them.

122
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:04,860
But not a child;
That backfires on you.

123
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,600
Thank you, Pastor Jeff.

124
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,270
You are most welcome.

125
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,340
Oh, and tell Sheldon

126
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,510
I spoke to my seminary proffessor

127
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,410
and the official ruling is:

128
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,410
God would appear to the octopus
Aliens in octopus Alien form

129
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,280
and save their eight legged souls.

130
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,450
Praise Jesus!

131
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,360
I should put that in a sermon.

132
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,170
Hold on, hold on.

133
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,330
Thank you God for this food
we are about to recieve

134
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,940
of our bodies, and bless the
hands prepared it. Amen.

135
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,940
We're doing this at breakfast now.

136
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,310
Yes, I think its a nice idea.

137
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,010
Shes eating Count Chocula.

138
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,050
Doesn't he play for the other side?

139
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,920
I'm so glad God blessed you
with a sense of humor, George.

140
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,790
Mom, have you received any
distressing phonecalls today?

141
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,720
No. Why?

142
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,420
Just wondering if this
is the appropriate time

143
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,530
to ask if you could
take me to Radio Shack.

144
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,990
Sorry, sweetheart, I can't today.

145
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,960
I have to bring this food
over to the Hanson Family.

146
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,760
Then I have my new prayer group.

147
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,200
And after that,
I'm gonna get started

148
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,370
on a faith garden in the backyard.

149
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
A faith garden?
What the hell is that.

150
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,410
Language.

151
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,440
Its an outdoorsy place
for me to speak to God.

152
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,080
Don't you already speak to him indoorsy.

153
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,780
Yes, but in the backyard,

154
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,910
I can enjoy the beautiful world
he gave us.

155
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,480
You can also smell the sparks chicken...

156
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,150
Well, I think it sounds nice.

157
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,790
Thank you. Im gonna need you truck

158
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,960
to get all the dirt and flower
that I need.

159
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,920
- Sure.
- Oh, oh, almost forgot.

160
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,360
Can you keep an eye out
for a rock big enough

161
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,060
to paint a Psalm on?

162
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,860
I can do that.

163
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,860
Wish me luck!

164
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,830
Luck!

165
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,530
Mm-hmm!

166
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,000
Is Mom okay?

167
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,540
How the heck should I know?

168
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,010
She left. You can say "hell."

169
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,000
If my mothers faith

170
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,240
was the Starship Enterprise,

171
00:08:04,245 --> 00:08:06,645
over the next week she
achieved warp factor 9.

172
00:08:06,646 --> 00:08:08,385
I cant hear you!

173
00:08:08,415 --> 00:08:09,655
Amen.

174
00:08:09,685 --> 00:08:11,285
Let em hear ya in heaven!

175
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:13,455
- Amen!
- Heck yeah! Amen!

176
00:08:14,685 --> 00:08:17,525
Despite his concerns over her sanity

177
00:08:17,555 --> 00:08:20,295
my dad found a rock worthy
of her faith garden.

178
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:21,365
Ooh, right over there.

179
00:08:21,395 --> 00:08:23,365
Here?

180
00:08:23,395 --> 00:08:24,595
Gently!

181
00:08:24,635 --> 00:08:27,535
...It's a rock.

182
00:08:27,565 --> 00:08:29,205
I know, but still.

183
00:08:45,755 --> 00:08:49,155
I pray that you protect Sheldon...

184
00:08:49,185 --> 00:08:50,355
What are you doing?

185
00:08:50,395 --> 00:08:51,455
I'm praying for you.

186
00:08:51,495 --> 00:08:53,525
She needs it more than I do.

187
00:08:53,565 --> 00:08:56,065
You think I didnt start with that.

188
00:09:12,445 --> 00:09:15,185
Lord, thank you for inspiring me

189
00:09:15,215 --> 00:09:18,155
to build this faith garden
and for your eternal love.

190
00:09:18,185 --> 00:09:23,455
Also, please look after
the Hanson family.

191
00:09:23,495 --> 00:09:27,195
to find strength...

192
00:09:27,225 --> 00:09:29,225
in their time of grief.

193
00:09:32,235 --> 00:09:37,335
And I thank you
for the years they have

194
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,345
with their beautiful daughter.

195
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:58,725
So when you gonna take me
to my learner's permit.

196
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,565
Georgie, you've heard us telling Sheldon

197
00:10:01,595 --> 00:10:04,365
about asking questions
at inappropriate time.

198
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,595
Yeah, so?

199
00:10:05,635 --> 00:10:07,465
So, given whats happened in this week

200
00:10:07,505 --> 00:10:08,705
do you think its appropriate time

201
00:10:08,735 --> 00:10:10,075
to be talking about driving?

202
00:10:10,105 --> 00:10:13,145
Why? Cause that girl died?

203
00:10:13,175 --> 00:10:16,175
Yes, that!

204
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,415
For your information,
I've been excellent driver.

205
00:10:18,445 --> 00:10:21,645
I wouldnt trust you to push...
car.

206
00:10:21,685 --> 00:10:23,555
Would you feel more
confident If I told you

207
00:10:23,585 --> 00:10:25,355
I already know
How to drive.

208
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:28,085
- Video games dont count.
- I'll have you know

209
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,725
I've driven Meemaws car.

210
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:33,095
I also drove your truck...
when you were sleeping

211
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,725
Are you crazy?!

212
00:10:35,765 --> 00:10:38,365
I parked it and everything,
you had no idea.

213
00:10:40,405 --> 00:10:42,535
Okay, let...

214
00:10:42,565 --> 00:10:43,775
let me get this straight...

215
00:10:43,805 --> 00:10:46,205
youre trying to prove to me
that you are responsible person.

216
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,415
by admitting you stole my truck.

217
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:52,115
I said I was responsible,
never said I was smart.

218
00:10:56,685 --> 00:10:57,655
Hey.

219
00:10:57,685 --> 00:10:59,555
Lets go out.

220
00:10:59,585 --> 00:11:02,185
- Go out where?
- I dont know,

221
00:11:02,225 --> 00:11:05,555
Dairy Queen, shooting range,
lawn dancing.

222
00:11:05,595 --> 00:11:07,765
Have you been drinking?

223
00:11:07,795 --> 00:11:11,295
I might've had
a wine cooler or two.

224
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:13,905
Sweetheart, that aint drinking.

225
00:11:23,245 --> 00:11:26,215
The bartender asked to see my ID

226
00:11:26,245 --> 00:11:27,885
Honey, he does that to get tips.

227
00:11:27,915 --> 00:11:30,485
He asked me for mine, too.

228
00:11:30,515 --> 00:11:33,485
Well, I like to think were
both young attractive ladies.

229
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:35,355
To that old fart, Yeah.

230
00:11:37,695 --> 00:11:40,525
Mmm.

231
00:11:40,565 --> 00:11:41,895
Whoa, pace yourself, cowgirl.

232
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:43,935
Im fine.

233
00:11:43,965 --> 00:11:45,695
Are we gonna shoot pool or not.

234
00:11:45,735 --> 00:11:47,405
You bet.

235
00:11:50,535 --> 00:11:51,775
Hmm!

236
00:11:51,805 --> 00:11:53,745
Did you know George and I
used to come here

237
00:11:53,775 --> 00:11:55,445
when we first started dating?

238
00:11:55,475 --> 00:11:56,745
Is that so?

239
00:11:56,775 --> 00:11:58,575
He kissed me right over there
on that booth.

240
00:11:58,615 --> 00:12:01,315
Why, was there some barbecue
sauce on your face.

241
00:12:02,285 --> 00:12:03,485
Its a fat joke.

242
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:06,425
I got it, Mom.

243
00:12:06,455 --> 00:12:09,695
Come on.

244
00:12:10,895 --> 00:12:12,455
Why are you putting us to bed?

245
00:12:12,495 --> 00:12:13,695
Cause your mothers out.

246
00:12:13,725 --> 00:12:14,695
Where is she?

247
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:15,695
She is with your grandmother.

248
00:12:15,725 --> 00:12:16,965
- Whered they go?
- I dont know.

249
00:12:16,995 --> 00:12:19,605
- Why dont you know?
- Because I'm here with you!

250
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:23,775
Good night. Sweet dreams.

251
00:12:23,805 --> 00:12:25,505
Mom gives us kisses.

252
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:30,615
Fine.

253
00:12:33,515 --> 00:12:35,615
Mm, your beard is scratchy.

254
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:36,615
Too bad. Sheldon?

255
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,415
I respectfully pass.

256
00:12:39,955 --> 00:12:42,185
Mom also does
the goodnight dance.

257
00:12:44,325 --> 00:12:46,925
Now youre just screwing with me.

258
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:49,665
Night.

259
00:12:49,695 --> 00:12:52,565
You shouldve gone with...
lullaby.

260
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,335
Yeah, I got cocky.

261
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,975
Slow down there, sister,
you've got Church in the morning.

262
00:12:59,005 --> 00:13:00,745
Who says I'm going?

263
00:13:00,775 --> 00:13:04,515
What is happening with you?

264
00:13:04,545 --> 00:13:07,645
Do you really want to know?

265
00:13:12,555 --> 00:13:16,655
So, the other day I was
making a cassarole

266
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:18,695
to bring over to the Hansons,

267
00:13:18,725 --> 00:13:21,725
and I wanted to include
a sympathy card.

268
00:13:21,765 --> 00:13:25,665
So I started to write,

269
00:13:25,695 --> 00:13:28,635
"Your daughters in a better place.

270
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:33,445
and I had to stop.

271
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:44,015
Because how could that possibly be true?

272
00:13:44,055 --> 00:13:46,525
How could a better place be anywhere

273
00:13:46,555 --> 00:13:49,795
than at home safe with her family.

274
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,625
She was just a little kid.

275
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:56,295
That could've...

276
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,405
been Georgie behind the wheel.

277
00:14:04,775 --> 00:14:08,945
How could that possibly be God's plan.

278
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:13,985
Looks like you could use
a shoulder to cry on.

279
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:18,755
No, she does not need
a shoulder to cry on.

280
00:14:18,785 --> 00:14:21,785
but I do need a place
to store my pool stick.

281
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:24,795
Maybe I'd like that.

282
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:27,025
Get.

283
00:14:33,735 --> 00:14:34,965
What the hell?

284
00:14:35,005 --> 00:14:37,775
Your problem now.

285
00:14:37,805 --> 00:14:39,545
- Ooh.
- Watch it.

286
00:14:39,575 --> 00:14:40,705
Here.

287
00:14:40,745 --> 00:14:41,805
What am I supposed to do with her.

288
00:14:41,845 --> 00:14:43,745
I dont know. But be careful.

289
00:14:43,775 --> 00:14:44,815
Last time she was this drunk,

290
00:14:44,845 --> 00:14:46,485
you ended up with
with your first son.

291
00:14:47,745 --> 00:14:48,815
Night.

292
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:51,885
He is not that fat, Mom!

293
00:14:58,595 --> 00:15:00,965
Now you're cooking breakfast for us.

294
00:15:00,995 --> 00:15:02,135
Your moms not feeling so well.

295
00:15:02,165 --> 00:15:04,005
- Is she contagious?
- No.

296
00:15:04,035 --> 00:15:05,105
Just tired.

297
00:15:05,135 --> 00:15:07,435
Did you check her for ticks?

298
00:15:07,475 --> 00:15:09,445
Soon as she wakes up.

299
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:10,875
You can check her
while she is asleep.

300
00:15:10,905 --> 00:15:11,875
Sit down!

301
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,015
Do you even know how to cook?

302
00:15:17,045 --> 00:15:20,115
Believe it or not, I am
capable of making breakfast.

303
00:15:20,155 --> 00:15:23,125
Sorry. Its not like we see
you do much around here.

304
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,125
How about,
thanks for cooking Dad.

305
00:15:25,155 --> 00:15:28,765
Chocolate chips?
thanks for cooking Dad.

306
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:31,795
Is Mom going to church?

307
00:15:31,825 --> 00:15:33,835
I don't think she is up to it.

308
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:36,565
But she never misses church.

309
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,875
Are you feeling better?

310
00:15:43,905 --> 00:15:46,015
Yes, baby, Im fine.

311
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:49,045
Allright, here we go.

312
00:15:49,085 --> 00:15:51,415
Chocolate chips for breakfast
and pizza for dinner.

313
00:15:51,445 --> 00:15:52,815
I'm loving Dad.

314
00:15:52,855 --> 00:15:55,755
Where were you last night?

315
00:15:55,785 --> 00:15:57,425
Out with your grandmother.

316
00:15:57,455 --> 00:15:58,325
But whered you go?

317
00:15:58,355 --> 00:16:00,455
- Enough questions.
- Yall ask me questions

318
00:16:00,495 --> 00:16:01,725
when I come home late.

319
00:16:01,765 --> 00:16:04,795
Oh, I can explain that... you're an idiot.
We don't trust you.

320
00:16:07,495 --> 00:16:09,505
Mom, you didn't say grace.

321
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:12,705
Don't worry about it.

322
00:16:14,505 --> 00:16:16,075
Come on, yall.

323
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:24,645
Can I sit with you?

324
00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:28,125
I think, Mommy needs
to be alone right now.

325
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:30,185
All right.

326
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:40,865
Mom, I'm scared.

327
00:16:40,895 --> 00:16:42,195
Why?

328
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:45,165
You didn't go to church,
you've stopped saying grace.

329
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,235
I dont understand
whats going on.

330
00:16:50,605 --> 00:16:52,205
Its kind of hard to explain.

331
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:55,045
Is it me?

332
00:16:55,075 --> 00:16:56,515
Did I do something wrong?

333
00:16:56,545 --> 00:16:58,245
Of course not.

334
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:00,055
Come here.

335
00:17:03,185 --> 00:17:07,825
Sheldon...

336
00:17:07,855 --> 00:17:10,095
faith means believing in something

337
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:13,735
you can't know for sure is real.

338
00:17:15,905 --> 00:17:20,175
And right now, I'm
struggling with that.

339
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,075
So you don't believe in God anymore.

340
00:17:23,105 --> 00:17:27,045
That isn't something for
you to worry about.

341
00:17:27,075 --> 00:17:28,915
I need to figure this out myself.

342
00:17:28,945 --> 00:17:32,055
Can I help?
Maybe I could provide fresh perspective.

343
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,785
I don't think so, baby.

344
00:17:39,595 --> 00:17:42,065
Did you know if gravity

345
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:43,295
were slightly more powerful

346
00:17:43,325 --> 00:17:45,665
the universe would collapse into a bowl.

347
00:17:45,695 --> 00:17:47,795
I did not.

348
00:17:47,835 --> 00:17:51,905
Also, if gravity were
slightly less powerful

349
00:17:51,935 --> 00:17:53,705
the universe would fly apart.

350
00:17:53,735 --> 00:17:56,005
and there would be no stars or planets.

351
00:17:56,045 --> 00:17:58,575
Where you going with this Sheldon?

352
00:17:58,615 --> 00:18:01,585
Its just that gravity
is precisely as strong

353
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:02,885
as it needs to be.

354
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,855
And if the ratio of the
electro magnetic force

355
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,715
to the strong force
wasn't one percent.

356
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:09,585
life wouldn't exist.

357
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,655
What are the odds that would
happen all by itself.

358
00:18:11,685 --> 00:18:15,665
Why are you trying to convince
me to believe in God?

359
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,595
You don't believe in God.

360
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,665
I don't, but the precision of the universe

361
00:18:19,695 --> 00:18:22,765
at least makes it logical to concude
there is a creator.

362
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:31,745
Baby, I appreciate what
you're trying to do.

363
00:18:31,775 --> 00:18:33,975
But logic is here.

364
00:18:34,015 --> 00:18:37,285
And my problem is here.

365
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:43,085
Well, there are 5 billion
people on this planet

366
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:46,095
and you're the perfect mom for me.

367
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,565
What are the odds of that?

368
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,905
Oh.

369
00:18:56,935 --> 00:19:01,075
Thank you, Lord,
for this little boy.

370
00:19:01,105 --> 00:19:05,145
I knew I could fix it.

371
00:19:05,175 --> 00:19:09,045
Maybe it was you and the Lord.

372
00:19:09,085 --> 00:19:11,185
I don't like shareing credit

373
00:19:11,215 --> 00:19:13,615
but I knew in that moment it
wasn't the appropriate time

374
00:19:13,655 --> 00:19:15,355
to say it.

375
00:19:22,165 --> 00:19:26,135
And Jacob said: "For I
have seen God face to face

376
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,165
and my life is preserved."

377
00:19:28,205 --> 00:19:30,505
Is this an appropriate time

378
00:19:30,785 --> 00:19:31,885
mention that John 1:18 says,

379
00:19:31,925 --> 00:19:36,125
"No man hath seen God at any time."
Who is right?

380
00:19:36,165 --> 00:19:37,525
Jacob or John?

381
00:19:37,565 --> 00:19:40,495
Lets talk about it in the car.

382
00:19:40,535 --> 00:19:41,565
The Lord,

383
00:19:41,595 --> 00:19:42,635
Yes, Connie?

384
00:19:42,665 --> 00:19:44,605
My grandson has a question.

385
00:19:46,205 --> 00:19:48,435
Let er rip, kid.

385
00:19:49,305 --> 00:20:49,207

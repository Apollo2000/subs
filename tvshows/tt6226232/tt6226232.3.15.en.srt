<i>Previously on</i>
Young Sheldon:

2
00:00:03,963 --> 00:00:05,423
Would you teach me baseball?

3
00:00:05,507 --> 00:00:07,800
What's bringing this on?

4
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:11,179
- I don't know.
- You Coach Ballard?

5
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:12,263
That'd be me.

6
00:00:12,347 --> 00:00:13,806
My daughter's here to try out.

7
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,141
She made the team.

8
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:17,435
Congratulations.

9
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,146
And Meemaw got a date
with the coach.

10
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,773
I was married for 18 years,

11
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:24,817
and I got to tell you, those were
the two best years of my life.

13
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,828
Practice running late?

14
00:00:35,912 --> 00:00:39,624
Yeah. Sparks kid got himself
stuck in the bathroom.

15
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:42,544
How'd that happen?

16
00:00:42,627 --> 00:00:45,672
Well, the door's a push
and he was a-pulling.

17
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:48,925
Look at him out there.

18
00:00:49,926 --> 00:00:52,220
Billy's my grandson.

19
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:54,347
Oh.

20
00:00:55,515 --> 00:00:56,975
I am so sorry.

21
00:00:57,058 --> 00:00:59,894
I mean, not that he's your grandson.
I'm just...

22
00:00:59,978 --> 00:01:01,604
I'm gonna stop talking now.

23
00:01:01,688 --> 00:01:04,065
I'm messing with you. Ha, ha.

24
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:08,736
- Well, you got me, all right.
- Ha-ha-ha.

25
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:11,406
No.

26
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:13,241
That one's mine over there. Evan.

27
00:01:16,286 --> 00:01:19,122
Oh, isn't that
the coach's grandson?

28
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:20,248
Uh-huh.

29
00:01:21,374 --> 00:01:24,544
So you must be
Coach Ballard's ex-wife?

30
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:26,838
Yeah. Why?

31
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:30,800
No reason.

<i>Growing up,
I had an aversion to any type of group.</i>

38
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:57,869
<i>For example, rock groups.</i>

39

42
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:08,796
<i>my mother, for making me wear
a funnel on my head.</i>

43
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,758
<i>But of all the groups
I didn't like by far,</i>

44
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:12,884
<i>the worst was...</i>

45
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,469
Group projects.

46
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,640
Yeah, you heard me.

47
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:21,851
This would be a lot more fun
with margaritas.

48
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:23,686
What isn't?

49
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:27,065
Then you'd love the way
I ran the PTA.

50
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:29,192
And you'd love the way I show up
at church.

51
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,071
You're fun.

52
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:35,156
We ought to go out for drinks
one night.

53
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,324
I'll give you my number.

54
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:38,826
Oh, yeah. Well, all right.

55
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,620
I'm around tomorrow if you're free.

56
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:42,080
Uh...

57
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:43,163
Sure.

58
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,584
You should know something, though.

59
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,128
Um.

60
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:52,507
I'm kind of dating your ex-husband.

61
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,345
You waited until now to tell me?

62
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:59,681
You're sneaky. I like that.

63
00:02:59,764 --> 00:03:01,766
That is not the feedback I usually get.

64
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:06,229
Well, since we're being honest...

65
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:09,774
I knew who you were the whole time.
That's why I came over here.

66
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:13,695
Damn.

67
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:16,072
Nicely played.

68
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:18,491
- So we're still on for drinks?
- Oh, hell yeah.

69
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,536
Yeehaw!

70
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:25,331
Can't we just do this individually?

71
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:27,875
Why are you complaining?
I'm the one stuck with a kid.

72
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,212
Hey, when it comes to physics,
I'm practically a coot.

73
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:34,132
Which is an old person word
for someone who's old.

74
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:35,842
- Tell him.
- It is.

75
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:37,510
Let's just go to a coffee shop.

76
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:38,593
I can't go now.

77
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:40,471
I have to get home for my bath
and bedtime.

78
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:42,598
Which is also something
an old person does.

79
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:43,725
That we do.

80
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:45,518
Can I at least switch groups?

81
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:48,730
Sorry. I assigned this project
because it's important

82
00:03:48,813 --> 00:03:51,274
for scientists to learn how to collaborate.

83
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,111
If we must work together,
here's my proposal.

84
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:57,530
I do everything by myself
and put their names on it.

85
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:59,323
- No.
- What's going on?

86
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:02,660
- Dr. Sturgis is forcing us to collaborate.
- Oh.

87
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:05,037
We wanted to get it done tonight,
but there's a bedtime

88
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:06,372
and shower conflict.

89
00:04:06,456 --> 00:04:09,417
- Bubble bath.
- Oh, right, it's bath night.

90
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,794
How about we work
in my dorm tomorrow?

91
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:14,338
Um, I don't know if a dormitory

92
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:16,674
is the right environment
for someone his age.

93
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:18,509
If you're worried
about the beer-drinking,

94
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:20,845
Dad has thoroughly desensitized me.

95
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:24,390
How about you all come work
at our house?

96
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:29,145
- I guess, if that's our only option.
- It'll be fun. I'll make food.

97
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:32,064
- You can even bring your laundry.
- That actually would be great.

98
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:35,693
Now this man's soiled underpants
will be in my kitchen.

99
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:36,778
Thank you.

100
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:42,408
I just don't understand
why you want to go out with her.

101
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:44,744
You don't? She seems like fun.

102
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:46,829
Yeah, she is, until you marry her

103
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:49,665
and then you find her sleeping
upside down in the closet.

104
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:51,876
No, I mean, seriously.

105
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,171
You don't think that having drinks
with my ex-wife is a little weird?

106
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:58,466
- You went camping with John.
- Oh, it was weird.

107
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:00,009
Trust me. Learn from me.

108
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:03,721
She spent 18 years with you.
I'd rather learn from her.

109
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:06,140
So you can dig up little dirt on me?

110
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:09,143
- Mm, yeah.
- Well, let me spoil it, then.

111
00:05:09,227 --> 00:05:10,978
She's gonna tell you about the time

112
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:13,022
I had a little too much to drink
on Halloween

113
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:15,483
and I ended up puking
in my son's candy bucket.

114
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:16,901
I bet she tells it better.

115
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,904
Then the time we had a fight
and I locked her out in a hailstorm.

116
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,531
- Damn.
- But in my defense,

117
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:23,783
when I locked her out it, it was raining.

118
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:27,078
- The hail was heaven-sent.
- You're a charmer.

119
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:29,622
So...

120
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:32,625
you didn't do anything you regret
when you were married?

121
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,837
Oh, lots of stuff.
Feel free to grab a shovel

122
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,548
and go have some drinks
with my dead husband.

123
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:40,174
Oh, that's dark.

124
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:43,469
- Not as dark as my secrets.
- Oh, you...

125
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:45,429
You are so hot.

126
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:50,059
- Ooh, chocolate chip.
- Just one.

127
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:52,144
The rest are for Sheldon's friends.

128
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:53,729
- Ready to go?
- Yep.

129
00:05:53,813 --> 00:05:55,273
- Go where?
- The mall.

130
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:57,441
What happened to asking
for permission?

131
00:05:57,525 --> 00:06:00,236
- I asked Dad.
- You know that doesn't count.

132
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,404
That's what he said.

133
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:04,991
- Bye.
- Love you.

134
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:08,911
Keith, Sam, come in.

135
00:06:08,995 --> 00:06:11,455
Sheldon, your friends are here.

136
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:14,041
- Let me put that laundry in for you.
- Oh, thank you.

137
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,251
None for you?

138
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:17,378
That's okay. I can do my own laundry.

139
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:20,006
Oh, okay.

140
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:24,969
Hello, Sam, Keith,
big bag of dirty underpants.

141
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:27,512
Hey, there.

142
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,474
I hope you don't mind,
I started without you.

143
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:32,602
Not at all.

144
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:35,396
Is this one for me or am I gonna be
carrying you home tonight?

145
00:06:36,606 --> 00:06:37,606
It's all yours.

146
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:40,651
Cheers.

147
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:43,613
- I like your blouse.
- Oh, you do?

148
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:46,866
Truth be told,
I changed my outfit three times.

149
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,452
- For little old me?
- Well, I've never gotten drinks

150
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:51,203
with a boyfriend's ex-wife.

151
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:55,207
Do you try to look hot or try
to look like you're not trying?

152
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:58,753
- Well, clearly, you went for hot.
- I wasn't even trying.

153
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:02,381
I think we can explain
the additional electrons

154
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:04,175
if we assume the barrier has a slope.

155
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,302
- That won't work.
- Okay, well,

156
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,596
- what if the electrons are...
- We need to consider

157
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:11,390
that the electrons are actually
moving backwards in time.

158
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:14,518
No, that math's gonna take forever.
Let's just do it my way.

159
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:16,938
Can you write? You probably
have the best handwriting.

160
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:20,149
- Why? Because I'm a girl?
- I'm sure it's better than mine.

161
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:21,901
I only learned to write six years ago.

162
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,490
Well, we've covered football
and grandkids...

163
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:29,700
Our favorite Golden Girl.

164
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:31,994
Did not peg you for a Dorothy.

165
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:34,747
What have we left out?

166
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:37,458
I don't know.

167
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,877
Maybe we've run out of stuff
to talk about.

168
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:41,754
Oh, wait.

169
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:43,506
We forgot about your ex-husband.

170
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:46,717
The one you're dating.

171
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:49,095
What do you want to know?

172
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:51,681
I know not to piss him off
during a hailstorm.

173
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:53,182
He told you that?

174
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,934
He wanted to throw himself
under the bus

175
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:58,104
- rather than let you push him.
- Did he tell you that I was naked

176
00:07:58,187 --> 00:07:59,689
when he locked me out?

177
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:02,108
No! Why did he do that?

178
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,193
Because was trying to hit him
with a golf club.

179
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:08,197
What were you doing naked
with a golf club in a hailstorm?

180
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:13,911
- You know, it was the '70s.
- I remember.

181
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:17,415
- What else you got?
- Hey, there's my man!

182
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:19,166
The doctor's in the house!

183
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,586
Hello, y'all!

184
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,670
Oh, boy.

185
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:30,469
Hey!

186
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:33,055
Connie!

187
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,056
Hey, John.

188
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:37,810
- How?
- We used to date.

189
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,770
So you dated him and Dale?

190
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,732
You don't have a type, do you?

191
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:44,108
What are you doing here?

192
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,860
Me? What are you doing here?

193
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,945
This is where I hang out now.

194
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:52,408
I grade papers,
I chat with the other patrons.

195
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:57,079
The people who like to bet
on football rub my head for luck.

196
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:00,374
- John, this is June.
- Hi.

197
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,667
June.

198
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:06,380
After Juno, wife of Jupiter
and queen of the gods.

199
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:10,259
No, after the fact that my mom
got knocked up in June.

200
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:11,552
Ribald!

201
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,471
Wonderful.

202
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,432
So, uh, how do you two
know each other?

203
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:19,852
Well, June here, actually,
is Dale's ex-wife.

204
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:23,647
And I am Connie's ex-boyfriend.

205
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:28,277
Ha, ha! Is that fun or weird?

206
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,738
- Yeah.
- Okay.

207
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:32,323
Okay.

208
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,450
Okay.

209
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,830
Something's not working out here.

210
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:42,958
Perhaps it's the way you're pacing.
Pick a number and stick to it.

211
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:44,960
Maybe it's because you two
aren't helping.

212
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:47,129
But I'm writing
with my prettiest handwriting.

213
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:48,923
- Don't be a child.
- Hey!

214
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:50,800
Oh, you were talking to her.

215
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:53,219
Who wants pigs in a blanket?

216
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:56,263
- Actually, do you have coffee?
- I just made a pot, help yourself.

217
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:01,227
- Anything I could get you?
- I need a cigarette.

218
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:05,648
So how's it going?

219
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:09,235
Great. Now that those two are gone,
I can finally get some work done.

220
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,784
They call it "Hot Dog on a Stick,"

221
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:19,036
but that's not the only food
on a stick they sell.

222
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,078
It's not?

223
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,457
- They also got cheese on a stick.
- Oh, no.

224
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,088
- You hiding from that guy?
- No.

225
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:31,882
- Oh, I get it, you like him.
- Shut up.

226
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:33,634
Aren't you a little young for that?

227
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,928
How old were you
when you started liking girls?

228
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:41,559
<i>Bye-bye. Bye. Hey, everybody,
free drinks on the house!</i>

229
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,227
Dang.

230
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,562
Way older than you.

231
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:47,857
Doesn't matter,
he doesn't like me anyway.

232
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,150
Sorry.

233
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:54,572
I liked it better
when you wanted to marry ALF.

234
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,782
I still kind of do.

235
00:10:56,866 --> 00:11:00,035
So you went camping with Dale?
How'd that go?

236
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:04,623
- Oh, I hesitate to speak ill of him.
- I divorced him. Say what you want.

237
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:07,293
- Then, it was terrible.
- All right,

238
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:09,211
come on, let's talk about
something else.

239
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:10,296
Okay.

240
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:13,215
A lot of people here like to talk
about the game.

241
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:16,343
- Really? You speak sports now?
- I sure do.

242
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:18,679
Check this out.

243
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:21,015
Hey, ref!

244
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,851
I suggest you go back
to referee school

245
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:27,771
and this time pay attention
in class!

246
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:30,357
You tell him, doc.

247
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:31,817
You're a doctor?

248
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:33,652
He has his PhD in physics,

249
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:37,156
but his specialty
is quantum chromodynamics.

250
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,742
Wow, that sounds interesting.

251
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:42,536
Oh, it is.
And I would tell you more about it,

252
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,497
but I'm lucky I remembered
the quantum chromodynamics.

253
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:47,791
And you didn't even have
to rub his head.

254
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:52,463
Well, it's here if the mood strikes.

255
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:57,509
Come on, Bucky, try throwing it
to someone on your own team.

256
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:59,470
Is that the Aggie game?

257
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,388
Yeah, we're down by ten.

258
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,016
You like A&M?

259
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:06,560
I was raised a Cornhusker,
but when in Texas...

260
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:09,647
Huh. Science and sports?

261
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,106
Didn't know that was a thing.

262
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,151
It is possible to be a scientist
and a normal guy.

263
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:18,030
May your team be victorious!

264
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:22,034
Not my experience.

265
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:29,291
I brought you some coffee.

266
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,001
You don't have to keep waiting on us.

267
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,754
I'm sorry, is there a problem?

268
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:39,385
- I'm just frustrated.
- Is it Sheldon?

269
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:43,138
It's Sheldon, and Keith,
and every other guy in our field,

270
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:45,432
which is basically everyone.

271
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:48,519
There were only three other women,
and one dropped out to get married.

272
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,896
Oh, good for her.

273
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,649
Or bad for science, bad for women.

274
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,443
None of the guys in my class
take me seriously.

275
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:59,363
It doesn't help when women like you
run around doing their laundry

276
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,490
and making them snacks.

277
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,450
I'm just being a good host.

278
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:05,619
Yeah, and raising another boy
to think that women

279
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:07,830
are just note-takers and mommies.

280
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:11,542
I'm sorry I'm making life so hard for you.

281
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:15,963
And for your information,

282
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:18,340
Sheldon does not look down on women,

283
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:21,760
he looks down on everyone.

284
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:29,810
<i>Friday the 13th Part VIII:
Jason Takes Manhattan</i>

285
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:32,688
- might be the best one.
- Muppets also took Manhattan.

286
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:36,608
There he is again.

287
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:39,403
- Why don't you go talk to him?
- Are you crazy?

288
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,779
Look how beautiful he is.

289
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,658
Sorry, the only guy
I'm calling beautiful is me.

290
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:47,328
And maybe David Hasselhoff.

291
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:53,500
I understand that you want
to be appreciated for what you do,

292
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:54,626
but so do I.

293
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,588
This is my home and taking care
of my family

294
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:01,091
is the choice that I've made,
and I am proud to do it.

295
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:02,175
Okay.

296
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:05,512
It is okay.

297
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:09,850
And I am sorry if me baking cookies
says something bad about women,

298
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,436
but if you think that Sheldon
is difficult to work with now,

299
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,480
you should try him
with low blood sugar.

300
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:17,316
He is a monster.

301
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:19,777
Someone's got to be in charge,

302
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,904
but when you step up,
everyone gets upset.

303
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,366
Your problem is a woman's mad at you

304
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:27,409
- and Sheldon thinks you're dumb?
- Yeah.

305
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:29,661
Welcome to my life, friend.

306
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:30,871
What do I do?

307
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:34,291
You quit complaining.

308
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,711
You're young, you're smart,
you're not tied down.

309
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,548
- This is as good as it gets.
- It is?

310
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:43,342
Yes.

311
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,594
I wish I was 20 again.

312
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,971
Eating and drinking
and being skinny.

313
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:50,849
Now go back in there,
finish your project,

314
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:53,435
and get your ass to a keg party.

315
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,519
Go!

316
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:58,190
<i>Somehow, my parents
calmed everyone down</i>

317
00:14:58,273 --> 00:14:59,817
<i>and got us back on track.</i>

318
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,029
<i>We listened to each other's thoughts,
and we worked as a team...</i>

319
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:05,906
<i>for almost four whole minutes.</i>

320
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,867
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Because you don't understand it.

321
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:10,244
It makes total sense, Keith.

322
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,746
Please, just take your underpants
and go.

323
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,460
Just say hi, keep it casual,

324
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:21,713
- pretend you don't care that much.
- But I care the most.

325
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:23,340
See, that's gonna freak him out.

326
00:15:23,424 --> 00:15:25,634
- How do you know?
- Because it's freaking me out.

327
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,261
Now go.

328
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,445
No touching!

329
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:46,447
That's right, you heard me!

330
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,496
- Hello?
- Hi, Connie.

331
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,831
Hi, John.

332
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:59,126
It was a nice surprise
running into you the other day.

333
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,502
It was.

334
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:02,045
<i>Anyway, question:</i>

335
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:05,966
Do you think your friend June
is interested in me romantically?

336
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,635
Oh, I...

337
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,761
Gee.

338
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:10,846
I don't know.

339
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:13,140
I only ask
because I'm not good at knowing

340
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,725
what other people are feeling.

341
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,936
- I'm aware.
- So could you ask her for me?

342
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,563
- No.
- You're right,

343
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,648
I should probably do it myself.

344
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:22,983
Can I have her number?

345
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:26,778
Well, you won over a whole bar...

346
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:29,031
maybe you could win over June, too.

347
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:37,289
- Hello?
- Hi, June. John Sturgis here.

348
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,166
We met the other day.

349
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:43,086
I'm the scientist
who won over the whole bar.

350
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,214
Oh, sure, I remember you.

351
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:47,591
<i>Good, good. Anyway...</i>

352
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:51,220
I was wondering if you had
any romantic interest in me.

353
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:53,597
You don't beat around the bush,
do you?

354
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,600
In medieval times,
hunters used to hire men

355
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,645
to beat the area around bushes
with sticks

356
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:02,481
in order to flush out game.

357
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:05,150
So no, I guess I don't do that.

358
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:06,860
John...

359
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,863
<i>you're a really sweet guy, but...</i>

360
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:14,493
I didn't feel like we had
that kind of connection.

361
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,955
Oh. I see.

362
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,331
I'm sorry.

363
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:22,334
No, that's all right. Um...

364
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:26,922
Truth is, I'm still
kind of heartbroken over Connie,

365
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:31,051
and I was hoping
if someone else liked me...

366
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:34,471
it might make it hurt less.

367
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:39,560
I don't know either one of you well,
but I wouldn't write off Connie yet.

368
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,729
Why? Did she say something?

369
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:46,191
No, but it's just the way
she looked at you.

370
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:48,735
See? That's what I'm terrible at.

371
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:50,487
How do you people do it?

372
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:53,574
Look, I know she's with Dale right now...

373
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:55,325
but we were married for a long time.

374
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:58,161
Trust me, he's gonna screw this up.

375
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:02,207
Follow up question:
Should I mention any of this to Connie?

376
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:05,919
- Mm, I wouldn't.
- Excellent.

377
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,921
Bye.

377
00:18:08,305 --> 00:19:08,789

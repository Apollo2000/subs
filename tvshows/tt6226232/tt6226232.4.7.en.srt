Which Bowtie says
"Mature enough

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,617
"to be in college,
but whimsical enough

00:00:05,702 --> 00:00:06,851
"to discuss which came first,

00:00:06,914 --> 00:00:08,625
the Higgs field 
or the photon"?

6
00:00:08,773 --> 00:00:10,612
They both say 
"Weird kid who eats alone."

7
00:00:10,788 --> 00:00:13,315
Hello, Dr. Sturgis.
This is Mary Cooper.

8
00:00:13,399 --> 00:00:17,188
Did you know there's a, uh,
supercollider being built

9
00:00:17,273 --> 00:00:19,429
- in Waxahachie, Texas?
- No.

10
00:00:19,734 --> 00:00:21,523
I've taken a job there.

11
00:00:21,608 --> 00:00:24,527
Hold on.
You're not gonna be around

12
00:00:24,668 --> 00:00:25,984
when Sheldon starts college?

13
00:00:26,148 --> 00:00:28,320
That's a great question.

14
00:00:28,531 --> 00:00:29,875
No.

15
00:00:32,745 --> 00:00:34,657
JEFF: Since everyone is going
back to school tomorrow,

16
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:37,281
let's finish up
with a back-to-school prayer.

17
00:00:37,365 --> 00:00:38,470
What?

18
00:00:38,554 --> 00:00:40,314
Does this prayer just
apply to middle school,

19
00:00:40,398 --> 00:00:42,773
or is it appropriate
for the college-bound?

20
00:00:42,858 --> 00:00:44,167
It's for everyone.

21
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,766
But thank you once again
for reminding us

22
00:00:46,851 --> 00:00:47,958
you're starting college.

23
00:00:48,042 --> 00:00:50,085
Oh, I don't mind.
You've got a lot on your plate.

24
00:00:50,182 --> 00:00:51,466
Just pray.

25
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,157
ALL: Dear Heavenly Father,
as we return to school,

26
00:00:55,242 --> 00:00:56,421
we look to your eternal...

27
00:00:56,506 --> 00:00:57,966
Billy, it's not the pledge.

28
00:01:01,017 --> 00:01:03,277
<i>It is clear that we cannot
expect the cooperation...</i> - [phone ringing]

29
00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:06,537
Normally I don't like facial
hair, but Spock makes it work.

30
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:08,936
- Hello?
- Sheldon,

31
00:01:09,084 --> 00:01:10,654
it's Dr. Linkletter.

32
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:13,085
I'm watching Star Trek:
The Original Series.

33
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,537
I'm sorry, I'm not up
on my cartoons.

34
00:01:15,622 --> 00:01:17,366
It's not a cartoon.
It's a live-action

35
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:18,759
science fiction show.

36
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,611
Although there is one called
Star Trek:

37
00:01:20,696 --> 00:01:21,961
The Animated Series.

38
00:01:22,046 --> 00:01:23,529
I believe you.

39
00:01:23,642 --> 00:01:25,795
I was wondering if I can
speak with your mommy.

40
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,248
Sure. Hold on.

41
00:01:27,385 --> 00:01:29,716
Mom, Dr. Linkletter's
on the phone.

42
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:31,397
While we wait,
here's a fun fact.

43
00:01:31,482 --> 00:01:32,810
In the animated series,

44
00:01:32,895 --> 00:01:34,771
Kukulkan was played by
James Doohan.

45
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,006
- Hello?
- James Doohan played Scotty

46
00:01:37,091 --> 00:01:38,400
on Star Trek:
The Original Series.

47
00:01:38,484 --> 00:01:39,997
Sheldon, I've got it.

48
00:01:40,082 --> 00:01:42,610
He tried several accents before
settling on Scottish.

49
00:01:42,695 --> 00:01:44,770
- MARY: Sheldon, hang up.
- SHELDON: Okay.

50
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:48,020
He felt the Scots were
excellent engineers. Bye.

51
00:01:48,762 --> 00:01:49,795
Dr. Linkletter,

52
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,045
<i>what can I do for you?</i>

53
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,602
Hello, Mrs. Cooper.
I just wanted to let you know,

54
00:01:53,687 --> 00:01:55,982
with Dr. Sturgis away,
I'll be available

55
00:01:56,067 --> 00:01:57,817
should Sheldon need anything.

56
00:01:57,908 --> 00:02:00,566
Oh, that is very comforting
to know.

57
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:02,216
Thank you so much.

58
00:02:02,301 --> 00:02:04,403
His well-being is important
to me,

59
00:02:04,716 --> 00:02:07,417
as was made abundantly clear
by my boss.

60
00:02:07,934 --> 00:02:11,317
Okay, well, we are truly
grateful.

61
00:02:11,402 --> 00:02:14,016
Now, I'm not terribly
experienced around children.

62
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,181
If he needs to use the restroom,
I don't have to

63
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:17,887
go in with him, do I?

Pastor Jeff already
covered this.

- He did? - Yeah, we're good.
- Amen.

77

- Amen.
- Amen.

78
00:02:50,925 --> 00:02:52,511
Can I take your truck tomorrow?

79
00:02:52,603 --> 00:02:54,307
Well, I think you're
riding with me.

80
00:02:54,487 --> 00:02:56,625
Sorry, I'm taking
Missy to school,

and Meemaw's
taking Sheldon.

82
00:02:58,885 --> 00:03:01,325
- Well, can I at least drive?
- Sure.

83
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:03,307
While you hide in the back
under a tarp?

84
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,895
Stop praying for him
and focus on the other two.

85
00:03:06,908 --> 00:03:08,651
Sheldon, good news.

86
00:03:08,736 --> 00:03:10,682
Dr. Linkletter was
calling to say

87
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:13,534
that while you're at school,
if you need anything,

88
00:03:13,619 --> 00:03:14,884
you can go to him.

89
00:03:15,044 --> 00:03:17,089
Starting college and
you need a babysitter.

90
00:03:17,174 --> 00:03:18,199
That's funny.

91
00:03:18,284 --> 00:03:19,953
I don't need a babysitter.

92
00:03:20,037 --> 00:03:24,174
Dr. Linkletter is just around
in case there's a problem.

93
00:03:24,258 --> 00:03:26,176
- Like if he needs a new diaper?
- Ha!

94
00:03:26,463 --> 00:03:29,050
Enough. Can we please have
a nice dinner?

95
00:03:29,135 --> 00:03:32,026
We could. But you're the one
who wants to eat as a family.

96
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:34,636
Don't pray for any of 'em.

97
00:03:36,471 --> 00:03:37,480
[knock on door]

98
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:39,929
- Dr. Linkletter.
- Sheldon.

99
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:42,160
How wonderfully early it is
to see you.

100
00:03:42,245 --> 00:03:44,605
If you've come by for a snack,
I picked you up

101
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,183
some crackers shaped like fish.

102
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,850
I just wanted to let you know

103
00:03:47,934 --> 00:03:49,461
that I don't need you
to babysit me.

104
00:03:49,545 --> 00:03:51,071
I'm perfectly self-reliant.

105
00:03:51,155 --> 00:03:53,726
Excellent. I'm not very
comfortable around children,

106
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,423
even with your level
of maturity.

107
00:03:55,507 --> 00:03:57,207
How old are you?
Six? Seven?

108
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,409
Eleven.

109
00:03:58,541 --> 00:03:59,818
I see.

110
00:03:59,903 --> 00:04:01,603
Then it's good I kept
the receipt for this

111
00:04:01,687 --> 00:04:04,065
bottle of bubbles
shaped like a bear.

112
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:06,129
I should get going.

113
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,610
My philosophy class starts
in a few minutes.

114
00:04:08,694 --> 00:04:11,874
Ah, yes, the great thinkers.
Socrates, Plato.

115
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:16,182
Speaking of which,
I got you some Play-Doh.

116
00:04:21,056 --> 00:04:23,058
I figure you don't
want me to walk you in?

117
00:04:23,143 --> 00:04:24,452
I've trained you well.

118
00:04:24,893 --> 00:04:27,281
Do you have everything
you need? Lunch money?

119
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,027
- Yep.
- Locker combination?

120
00:04:29,112 --> 00:04:30,346
Right here.

121
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:33,432
- Why is it there?
- Writing on my hand is so fifth grade.

122
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:34,963
Of course.

123
00:04:35,564 --> 00:04:37,450
Okay, I'm gonna go in.

124
00:04:38,596 --> 00:04:40,190
I assume you don't
want a hug?

125
00:04:40,354 --> 00:04:42,139
Make it quick.

126
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,764
- That's enough.
- Okay.

127
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:49,299
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

00:05:11,696 --> 00:05:12,673
Found his homeroom.

ERICSON: Welcome to the world
of philosophy.

149
00:05:48,238 --> 00:05:51,899
Most college courses are about
teaching you things

150
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:53,815
that you don't know.
Here,

151
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:57,284
I am going to teach you
that you don't even know

152
00:05:57,368 --> 00:05:59,014
what you think you know.

153
00:05:59,615 --> 00:06:00,616
Oh, boy.

154
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:08,561
The Chinese philosopher
Chuang Tzu believed

155
00:06:08,646 --> 00:06:11,228
it was possible he didn't
really know anything

156
00:06:11,312 --> 00:06:13,351
because he might just be
a butterfly

157
00:06:13,436 --> 00:06:15,889
dreaming that he was
a philosopher.

158
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,569
Yeah.
He wasn't a butterfly.

159
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,054
Well, how do you know?

160
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:22,257
The butterfly brain
doesn't contain enough neurons

161
00:06:22,342 --> 00:06:24,749
to generate a complex dream.
Plus, you referred to him

162
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:26,538
as Chinese philosopher
Chuang Tzu,

163
00:06:26,623 --> 00:06:28,670
and not Chinese butterfly
Chuang Tzu.

164
00:06:28,951 --> 00:06:31,569
- You must be Sheldon Cooper.
- Yes, ma'am.

165
00:06:31,654 --> 00:06:34,390
Very well, Mr. Cooper,
how do you know

166
00:06:34,475 --> 00:06:36,686
you're not just dreaming
butterflies can't dream?

167
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,874
Because I'm awake.

168
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,990
Or are you dreaming
you're awake?

169
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:42,686
You can see I'm awake
and you can hear me talking.

170
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:45,007
Yeah... I don't know.

171
00:06:45,123 --> 00:06:48,623
I saw some pretty trippy stuff
at a Grateful Dead concert.

172
00:06:48,795 --> 00:06:51,155
The drummer turned into
a tap-dancing walrus

173
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,686
and floated away.

174
00:06:52,771 --> 00:06:56,116
So we can't really trust
our senses, can we?

175
00:06:56,201 --> 00:06:57,436
We can validate them by

176
00:06:57,521 --> 00:06:59,546
comparing them
with other observers.

177
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:01,374
Mm, but that would mean

178
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:03,202
we have to hear
what they say,

179
00:07:03,287 --> 00:07:06,805
which requires...
trusting our senses.

180
00:07:07,412 --> 00:07:10,357
Do you see a problem
with your argument, Mr. Cooper?

181
00:07:10,467 --> 00:07:12,226
I could concentrate better
if you weren't

182
00:07:12,311 --> 00:07:13,771
flashing your toes at me.

183
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:16,139
Billy's a sweet kid.

184
00:07:16,498 --> 00:07:19,623
But these middle schoolers
are gonna eat him alive.

185
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:23,186
You don't know that.
Maybe they'll be nice.

186
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:25,202
Boy, if we were in
middle school right now,

187
00:07:25,287 --> 00:07:27,490
I'd have your head
in a toilet so fast.

188
00:07:27,677 --> 00:07:30,710
If you want, I can ask Missy
to hang out with him,

189
00:07:30,795 --> 00:07:32,061
make sure things go okay.

190
00:07:32,146 --> 00:07:34,428
- Absolutely not.
- Why?

191
00:07:34,607 --> 00:07:36,835
That girl is cute
and sassy,

192
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:39,226
and has a real chance
at being popular.

193
00:07:39,311 --> 00:07:42,240
Do not take that from her.
Or me.

194
00:07:42,638 --> 00:07:45,030
Popularity isn't
that important.

195
00:07:45,154 --> 00:07:47,318
It is the most important.

196
00:07:47,545 --> 00:07:50,249
Look at us.
I'm miserable.

197
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:52,561
You're always worried
about something.

198
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:56,108
I'd like one girl
around here to win.

199
00:07:56,318 --> 00:07:59,061
I'm not
always worried.

200
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,241
It's Sheldon's first day
of college,

201
00:08:01,326 --> 00:08:02,850
and you're not freaking out?

202
00:08:02,935 --> 00:08:04,716
- It's on my mind.
- Mm.

203
00:08:04,801 --> 00:08:08,015
But he's been looking forward
to this for a long time.

204
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,959
I'm sure he's having
a wonderful day.

205
00:08:10,118 --> 00:08:12,670
She displayed complete contempt
for science.

206
00:08:12,755 --> 00:08:14,281
She claimed that
knowledge was a myth,

207
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:16,779
and then she told the class
they could take their shoes off.

208
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:18,102
Some of them did.

209
00:08:18,258 --> 00:08:20,444
Luckily we've established
you're a mature young man

210
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:22,003
capable of figuring this out
on his own,

211
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:24,005
so, go get 'em, sport.

212
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:26,389
But as a man of science,
aren't you offended by this?

213
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:28,476
Sheldon, this is
a college campus.

214
00:08:28,561 --> 00:08:29,924
You come across all sorts.

215
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:31,752
Anarchists, communists, vegans.

216
00:08:31,836 --> 00:08:34,103
There's a fella in the religion
department that believes God is

217
00:08:34,187 --> 00:08:36,453
two women, and their names
are Wendy and Claire.

218
00:08:36,537 --> 00:08:38,928
But to say nobody
actually knows anything,

219
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:41,153
how could she know that?
It's a contradiction.

220
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,680
How about I blow some bubbles
out of a bear's head

221
00:08:43,764 --> 00:08:44,835
and we call it a day?

222
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,593
I don't know how I'm going
to last all semester

223
00:08:46,677 --> 00:08:48,815
with this free wheeling hippy.

224
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,347
Sheldon, I don't know
what to tell you.

225
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,382
If you're that unhappy,
just drop the class.

226
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,665
Of course.
Drop the class.

227
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,616
This is college.
I can do that.

228
00:08:57,732 --> 00:08:59,470
- There you go.
- Thank you.

229
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:01,345
- You're welcome.
- From now on,

230
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,783
I'm coming to you
with all my problems.

231
00:09:04,032 --> 00:09:05,512
Oh...

232
00:09:10,469 --> 00:09:13,950
"The statement on the other side
of this sign is true."

233
00:09:16,819 --> 00:09:17,819
Ugh.

234
00:09:17,926 --> 00:09:20,236
Professor Ericson?

235
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,353
ERICSON:
Come in.

236
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,695
Mr. Cooper, welcome.
How can I help you?

237
00:09:26,794 --> 00:09:28,451
I would like
to drop your class.

238
00:09:28,536 --> 00:09:30,603
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

239
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:33,204
I enjoyed our discussion
about skepticism.

240
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:34,439
And butterflies.

241
00:09:34,524 --> 00:09:36,198
I'm a scientist,
and I don't find

242
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:38,123
those types of questions
worth my time.

243
00:09:38,207 --> 00:09:40,473
And butterflies are just worms
that can chase you.

244
00:09:40,557 --> 00:09:41,697
[laughs softly]

245
00:09:42,111 --> 00:09:43,627
The questions of philosophy

246
00:09:43,712 --> 00:09:45,260
are extremely challenging.

247
00:09:45,345 --> 00:09:47,448
People have spent
2,000-plus years

248
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:49,541
trying to solve them
without success.

249
00:09:49,626 --> 00:09:53,834
So if you feel like giving up,
I don't blame you.

250
00:09:54,103 --> 00:09:55,580
I'm not giving up.

251
00:09:55,665 --> 00:09:57,455
I'm saying
they're not important.

252
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,145
Okay, so what is
important?

253
00:10:00,229 --> 00:10:02,111
The acquisition
of factual knowledge.

254
00:10:02,196 --> 00:10:04,810
And how do you know
if something is factual?

255
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,712
You test it
and see if it holds true.

256
00:10:06,797 --> 00:10:09,165
And how do you know
that that's factual?

257
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,182
[strains]:

258
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:12,418
You're doing it again.

259
00:10:12,502 --> 00:10:14,768
Maybe you're dreaming
I'm doing it.

260
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,161
How was your first day?

261
00:10:16,322 --> 00:10:18,220
Infuriating.

262
00:10:18,378 --> 00:10:19,860
How was your first day?

263
00:10:19,944 --> 00:10:21,297
So good.

264
00:10:21,381 --> 00:10:22,773
How was your first day?

265
00:10:27,308 --> 00:10:30,806
And then she said,
"Maybe you're just dreaming."

266
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,013
- Are you gonna drop the class?
- Yes,

267
00:10:33,478 --> 00:10:35,549
but only after
I systematically destroy

268
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:38,573
her half-baked arguments
in front of everybody else.

269
00:10:38,658 --> 00:10:40,275
It's good to have goals.

270
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,317
And at lunch,
an eighth-grade boy said,

271
00:10:42,402 --> 00:10:45,197
and I quote,
"I like Funyuns, too."

272
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,353
Wow.

273
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,678
I know.

274
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:52,675
I stopped at the library today
and picked up

275
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,619
books on epistemology,
Descartes's dream argument

276
00:10:55,704 --> 00:10:57,876
and the foundations
of scientific logic.

277
00:10:57,961 --> 00:10:59,444
Do you know
what she's going to do?

278
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:01,055
Rue the day?

279
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,994
The day, the night.
If it's rue-able,

280
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,587
she's going to rue it.

281
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,558
And in math class,
I sit right between

282
00:11:06,643 --> 00:11:08,119
Heather M. and Heather B.

283
00:11:08,204 --> 00:11:09,861
It's nice
you're with your friends.

284
00:11:09,946 --> 00:11:12,374
It's more than nice.
All notes go through me.

285
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:13,845
That's power.

286

ADULT SHELDON:
<i>The good name of Lady Science</i>

291
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:33,322
had been besmirched

292
00:11:33,407 --> 00:11:35,704
and it was up to me
to defend her honor.

293
00:11:35,892 --> 00:11:38,362
I had a lot of ground
to cover in one night.

294
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,674
Thankfully, 11 years of
my family's incessant yammering

295
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:44,306
had given me an extraordinary
ability to focus.

296
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,308
But I want to watch
Fresh Prince.

297
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:48,025
Too bad. The game is on.

298
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,908
There's always a game on.
Dad?

299
00:11:49,993 --> 00:11:51,535
Sorry, kid, it's the Cowboys.

300
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,885
But it's the season premiere.

301
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,494
Fresh Prince's

What if we don't turn

00:12:17,462 --> 00:12:18,752
<i>has its definite place."</i>

317
00:12:18,837 --> 00:12:20,329
MARY:
Shelly, it's your turn.

318
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:21,712
Shelly?

319
00:12:22,298 --> 00:12:23,642
What's happening?

320
00:12:23,836 --> 00:12:25,181
We're playing
a board game.

321
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:26,540
Before dinner?

322
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,219
You ate dinner.

323
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:30,525
- [doorbell rings]
- Did I like it?

324
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:32,642
You said the meat loaf
was dry.

325
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:34,157
That sounds right.

326
00:12:37,037 --> 00:12:40,130
Hi, Brenda. I just wanted to
see how today went.

327
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:41,299
Oh.

328
00:12:41,603 --> 00:12:43,275
[clears throat]

329
00:12:44,318 --> 00:12:45,300
[groans]

330
00:12:45,385 --> 00:12:46,385
Not great.

331
00:12:46,469 --> 00:12:48,533
Sheldon is already
in some sort of fight

332
00:12:48,618 --> 00:12:50,471
with his philosophy professor.

333
00:12:50,556 --> 00:12:53,283
- About what?
- Currently, he's plotting

334
00:12:53,368 --> 00:12:55,290
"the destruction
of her worldview,"

335
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,673
- whatever that means.
- Sounds exciting.

336
00:12:57,758 --> 00:13:00,416
It's mostly him reading a book
and giggling to himself.

337
00:13:00,501 --> 00:13:02,245
How about Billy?

338
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,464
Not much better.

339
00:13:03,556 --> 00:13:05,213
Oh.
In Spanish class,

340
00:13:05,297 --> 00:13:07,807
every time the teacher said
"Sí,"Billy said, "See what?"

341
00:13:07,892 --> 00:13:09,478
Oh, Billy.

342
00:13:09,562 --> 00:13:12,743
I know, but if I don't
laugh about it I'll cry.

343
00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:13,965
I'm sorry.

344
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,556
How did Missy do?

345
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:17,777
I think Missy had
the best day of her life.

346
00:13:17,862 --> 00:13:20,085
[exhales]: Oh, thank God.
Tell me everything.

347
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:24,264
Well, in one class
she sits between her friends,

348
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,204
so the note-passing
goes through her.

349
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:29,077
She's gonna get the dirt
firsthand. That's huge.

350
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:31,799
And then an eighth-grade boy
talked to her at lunch.

351
00:13:31,884 --> 00:13:33,415
- On the first day?
- Uh-huh.

352
00:13:33,507 --> 00:13:35,509
She's gonna be prom queen.
I'm calling it.

353
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:37,158
- [laughs]
- That's fun,

354
00:13:37,243 --> 00:13:39,807
but let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

355
00:13:39,892 --> 00:13:41,971
Mary, it'll be a miracle

356
00:13:42,056 --> 00:13:44,121
if Billy even makes it
to high school.

357
00:13:44,205 --> 00:13:45,685
Don't take this away from me.

358
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:49,580
Missy is gonna look so cute
in that tiara.

359
00:13:49,689 --> 00:13:50,690
Yes, she is.

360
00:13:50,775 --> 00:13:52,260
That's the Fresh Prince.

361
00:13:52,344 --> 00:13:53,870
He's from West Philadelphia.

362
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:55,548
Born and raised.

363
00:13:57,681 --> 00:13:59,526
ADULT SHELDON:
<i>It was past my bedtime,</i>

364
00:13:59,611 --> 00:14:01,666
<i>but who could sleep
with a page-turner</i>

365
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:04,596
<i>likeMeditations on First
Philosophy by René Descartes?</i>

366
00:14:04,681 --> 00:14:06,955
<i>Descartes was more
than just a philosopher.</i>

367
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,994
<i>He was also the mathematician</i>

368
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:10,930
<i>who invented
the Cartesian plane.</i>

369
00:14:11,014 --> 00:14:13,064
<i>If you've ever enjoyed
that X squared</i>

370
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:15,021
<i>plus Y squared
equals K is a circle,</i>

371
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:17,806
<i>you can say merci beaucoup
to Monsieur Descartes.</i>

372
00:14:24,654 --> 00:14:25,884
Hello?

373
00:14:26,084 --> 00:14:27,480
Bonjour, Sheldon.

374
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:29,431
Bonjour, René Descartes.

375
00:14:29,516 --> 00:14:31,257
Please, sit.

376
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:38,142
I see you're reading a book
on philosophy by Aristotle.

377
00:14:38,227 --> 00:14:41,624
I am. And it is garbage!

378
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:46,136
Aristotle is,
how you say, a punk!

379
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:51,814
I'm also having trouble
with my philosophy professor.

380
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:54,470
Hmm? She says that we don't know
if science is true.

381
00:14:54,555 --> 00:14:56,056
Mon dieu!

382
00:14:56,347 --> 00:14:58,787
Without science,
we know nothing.

383
00:14:59,082 --> 00:15:02,572
No different than the dogs
and kitties in the street

384
00:15:02,658 --> 00:15:05,596
wandering around
in a fog of ignorance

385
00:15:05,681 --> 00:15:07,509
with the woofings
and the meowings.

386
00:15:07,594 --> 00:15:09,337
So how do I get her
to understand that science

387
00:15:09,421 --> 00:15:12,688
can form true beliefs
about reality as it really is?

388
00:15:12,772 --> 00:15:14,642
Ah, young man.

389
00:15:14,794 --> 00:15:17,431
You are you asking
what is the foundation

390
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,087
of knowledge, huh?

391
00:15:19,212 --> 00:15:22,118
Yes. Well,
hold on to your chapeau.

392
00:15:22,204 --> 00:15:23,479
I'm not wearing a chapeau.

393
00:15:23,564 --> 00:15:25,103
It is just an expression.

394
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:26,192
Sorry.

395
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:28,494
All knowledge must rest

396
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:33,540
on a foundation that we can
never doubt and that is...

397
00:15:34,751 --> 00:15:36,093
Of course.

398
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:38,245
ERICSON: So we learned
that the theory of knowledge

399
00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:40,324
poses some
very serious problems.

400
00:15:40,609 --> 00:15:42,673
Excuse me, Professor Ericson.

401
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:46,199
I've done a little reading since
last we spoke, and I'm prepared

402
00:15:46,283 --> 00:15:49,377
to show you that everything
we know about science is true.

403
00:15:49,461 --> 00:15:51,161
Well, I am all ears.

404
00:15:51,245 --> 00:15:54,469
You said I couldn't
truly know anything,

405
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,033
but there is one thing
that I do know.

406
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,446
If I question, I must think;

407
00:15:58,531 --> 00:16:00,188
If I think, I must exist.

408
00:16:00,624 --> 00:16:06,238
Cogito, ergo sum:
I think, therefore I am.

409
00:16:08,461 --> 00:16:09,835
You're right.

410
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,615
You're darn right I'm right.

411
00:16:12,024 --> 00:16:14,439
Guys, g-give it up for Sheldon.

412
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:16,241
[applause]

413
00:16:18,023 --> 00:16:19,938
Now for a job
well done...

414
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,666
...here is a flower
full of sweet nectar.

415
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:25,234
Why would I want that?

416
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:28,048
Because you're a butterfly
and this is just your dream.

417
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:29,746
I'm not a butterfly.

418
00:16:29,934 --> 00:16:31,423
Are you sure?

419
00:16:31,609 --> 00:16:32,829
[laughs]

420
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:35,126
[laughter echoing]

421
00:16:35,472 --> 00:16:36,607
[gasps]

422
00:16:36,907 --> 00:16:39,189
[sighs]
It was a dream.

423
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,094
Oh, no.

424
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:43,663
[grunts]
Help!

425
00:16:43,748 --> 00:16:45,415
I'm a butterfly!

426
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,158
Nothing I know is real!
Everything is a dream!

427
00:16:48,297 --> 00:16:49,907
Missy, help!

428
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,345
No!

429
00:16:54,535 --> 00:16:56,059
[gasps]

430
00:16:57,968 --> 00:16:59,103
Missy,

431
00:16:59,202 --> 00:17:01,267
am I awake
or is this a dream?

432
00:17:01,489 --> 00:17:03,509
Shut up, dingus.

433
00:17:03,594 --> 00:17:04,939
Okay, I'm awake.

434
00:17:08,337 --> 00:17:10,485
Shelly,
you feeling all right?

435
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:11,835
Yes.

436
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,509
How come you're not dressed?

437
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:14,913
Why should I?

438
00:17:15,387 --> 00:17:17,579
'Cause you're gonna be
late for school.

439
00:17:17,664 --> 00:17:20,212
- I'm not going to school.
- Why not?

440
00:17:20,297 --> 00:17:22,079
Because I don't know
what's real.

441
00:17:22,164 --> 00:17:23,392
What does that mean?

442
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:24,946
Dreaming and waking,

443
00:17:25,031 --> 00:17:28,646
life and death,
philosophers and butterflies,

444
00:17:28,941 --> 00:17:30,446
they're all the same.

445
00:17:31,557 --> 00:17:33,110
Nothing matters.

446
00:17:33,744 --> 00:17:37,273
That's an interesting way
of looking at things.

447
00:17:37,358 --> 00:17:38,640
George?

448
00:17:38,742 --> 00:17:39,953

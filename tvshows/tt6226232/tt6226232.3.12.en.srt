1
00:00:01,156 --> 00:00:03,279
Previously on Young Sheldon...

2
00:00:03,281 --> 00:00:04,843
- Who are you?
- I'm Paige.

3
00:00:04,845 --> 00:00:07,630
A unique child can
require a lot of attention.

4
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:08,780
Try all the attention.

5
00:00:08,782 --> 00:00:11,391
Barry and I haven't been in
a good place in a long time.

6
00:00:11,393 --> 00:00:14,368
This is oddly reminiscent
of a dinner with my family.

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,464
Do you think Stone Age parents
stayed together forever?

8
00:00:17,466 --> 00:00:19,399
They had to. There were no lawyers.

9
00:00:19,401 --> 00:00:21,391
Well, I think my parents
are getting a divorce.

10
00:00:21,393 --> 00:00:23,403
- Why?
- They fight all the time.

11
00:00:23,405 --> 00:00:25,772
- About what?
- Mostly me.

12
00:00:25,774 --> 00:00:27,240
I guess I'm lucky.

13
00:00:27,242 --> 00:00:28,375
Why?

14
00:00:28,377 --> 00:00:31,212
I'm the glue that holds
our family together.

15
00:00:35,717 --> 00:00:37,173
No more coffee?

16
00:00:37,175 --> 00:00:38,231
Last cup.

17
00:00:38,233 --> 00:00:40,019
Well, you mind making more?

18
00:00:40,021 --> 00:00:41,554
I just sat down.

19
00:00:41,556 --> 00:00:43,256
But you finished the pot.

20
00:00:43,258 --> 00:00:45,325
George, if I wanted to
make a cup of coffee,

21
00:00:45,327 --> 00:00:46,894
I'd have stayed at my house.

22
00:00:48,096 --> 00:00:49,195
Mmm.

23
00:00:49,197 --> 00:00:51,164
One day I'm gonna put you in a home,

24
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,966
and I'm gonna smile just like that.

25
00:00:52,968 --> 00:00:54,123
That's fine.

26
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:56,293
By then I won't know who you are anyway.

27
00:00:57,506 --> 00:00:59,906
Guess who is getting a divorce.

28
00:00:59,908 --> 00:01:02,242
About time. Congrats.

29
00:01:02,244 --> 00:01:04,657
Linda and Barry Swanson.

30
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:07,313
Who's that? A-And can you
tell me how to make coffee?

31
00:01:07,315 --> 00:01:10,173
- They're Paige's parents.
- Who?

32
00:01:10,175 --> 00:01:11,551
The little smart girl.

33
00:01:11,553 --> 00:01:15,121
Apparently she's taking
the divorce really hard.

34
00:01:15,123 --> 00:01:17,377
I guess she's been
having trouble in school.

35
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:18,958
Aw, poor thing.

36
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,327
Linda thinks Sheldon
might be a good influence,

37
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:23,730
you know, maybe rub
off on her a little bit.

38
00:01:23,732 --> 00:01:27,233
What, she wants her kid
to be more like Sheldon?

39
00:01:27,235 --> 00:01:29,702
I don't know what to say about that.

40
00:01:29,704 --> 00:01:32,138
So, good news.

41
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,920
Paige is gonna spend
the weekend with us.

42
00:01:34,922 --> 00:01:36,376
My history with Paige

43
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:38,735
brought up complicated feelings.

44
00:01:38,737 --> 00:01:39,859
She challenged me.

45
00:01:39,861 --> 00:01:41,147
Do you know if you'll be doing

46
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:42,615
a full-color octet calculation

47
00:01:42,617 --> 00:01:44,484
with matrix manipulations?

48
00:01:44,486 --> 00:01:46,194
I know you're in my spot.

49
00:01:46,196 --> 00:01:47,554
She disturbed me.

50
00:01:47,556 --> 00:01:49,622
Hi, Sheldon!

51
00:01:49,624 --> 00:01:51,191
She enraged me.

52
00:01:51,193 --> 00:01:52,193
Checkmate.

53
00:01:53,662 --> 00:01:54,861
Things were simpler

54
00:01:54,863 --> 00:01:56,463
for my simple-minded sister.

55
00:01:56,465 --> 00:01:57,465
Yay!

56
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,074

57
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,946
Shelly, I got you something.

58
00:02:22,948 --> 00:02:26,250
The Professor Proton Science Kit!

59
00:02:26,252 --> 00:02:28,152
Wait a minute.

60
00:02:28,154 --> 00:02:30,053
Last time you gave me
a present for no reason,

61
00:02:30,055 --> 00:02:31,889
I had to get a booster shot.

62
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:33,223
Nothing like that.

63
00:02:33,225 --> 00:02:36,226
I was just thinking, it
might be a fun thing for you

64
00:02:36,228 --> 00:02:37,461
to share with Paige.

65
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:40,864
Sharing. Sometimes I feel
like you don't know me.

66
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:43,734
Paige is having a rough
time at home right now,

67
00:02:43,736 --> 00:02:46,103
and I think she could
really use a friend.

68
00:02:46,105 --> 00:02:47,812
A crocodile could really use a meal,

69
00:02:47,814 --> 00:02:50,007
but that doesn't mean I
should leap into his mouth.

70
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:54,011
Shelly, I am asking
you to do this for me.

71
00:02:54,013 --> 00:02:55,746
This was the woman

72
00:02:55,748 --> 00:02:58,382
who cut the crusts off my sandwiches.

73
00:02:58,384 --> 00:03:01,386
She had me. Into the mouth I go.

74
00:03:02,788 --> 00:03:04,788

75
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,036
♪ Just blows me away, yeah... ♪

76
00:03:08,038 --> 00:03:09,827
Why haven't you mowed the lawn?

77
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:11,094
I been busy.

78
00:03:11,096 --> 00:03:13,297
Well, you're not busy now.

79
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:14,398
I'm working out.

80
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,733
Got the word "work" right there in it.

81
00:03:18,804 --> 00:03:20,704
Get out there and mow.

82
00:03:20,706 --> 00:03:22,919
Why? I'm making good money.

83
00:03:22,921 --> 00:03:24,968
I don't need an allowance,
so I don't need to do chores.

84
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,247
It's not about that.

85
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:28,712
You're part of this family,
you still need to help out.

86
00:03:28,714 --> 00:03:30,180
So I'm just here to do your bidding?

87
00:03:30,182 --> 00:03:33,284
Well, and people say Sheldon's a genius.

88
00:03:37,823 --> 00:03:40,791
I just want to remind you
both to please be sensitive

89
00:03:40,793 --> 00:03:43,694
about the situation with Paige's family.

90
00:03:43,696 --> 00:03:45,162
She's talking to you, dingus.

91
00:03:45,164 --> 00:03:46,586
Both of you.

92
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,519
- Hi, come in.
- Hello.

93
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,168
Hi, Missy. Hi, Sheldon.

94
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,504
What did you do to your
hair? Is this because

95
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:54,738
your parents got divorced?

96
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,006
Dingus.

97
00:03:56,008 --> 00:03:57,441
Well, she just really wanted to,

98
00:03:57,443 --> 00:03:59,510
and I thought, you know,
under the circumstances,

99
00:03:59,512 --> 00:04:01,912
- why not?
- Well, I think it looks great.

100
00:04:01,914 --> 00:04:05,123
- So, can I have pink... ?
- No. Why don't you kids go play?

101
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,584
I'd rather have pink hair
than together parents.

102
00:04:07,586 --> 00:04:09,053
I don't blame you.

103
00:04:12,858 --> 00:04:15,026
Well, it's about time.

104
00:04:18,297 --> 00:04:19,997
Hi, Mr. Cooper!

105
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:23,433
Billy. What are you doing?

106
00:04:23,435 --> 00:04:24,968
I'm mowing the lawn.

107
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,527
- What are you doing?
- Did Georgie put you up to this?

108
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:28,872
Yeah. He's paying me.

109
00:04:28,874 --> 00:04:30,569
That dummy.

110
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:33,278
I'm raising the money to buy a Jet Ski.

111
00:04:35,247 --> 00:04:37,014
I mean, I'm thrilled that he's gone,

112
00:04:37,016 --> 00:04:38,882
but I do worry about
how it's affecting Paige.

113
00:04:38,884 --> 00:04:40,317
Of course.

114
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,679
You and George have
such a beautiful family.

115
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:45,483
I think it's good for her
to be around that right now.

116
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,992
Oh. Hey.

117
00:04:48,994 --> 00:04:51,795
Nice to see you. Sorry
about the divorce.

118
00:04:51,797 --> 00:04:54,271
I got to go yell at my idiot son.

119
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:55,774
Georgie! Where are you?

120
00:04:58,103 --> 00:04:59,836
You look great, by the way.

121
00:04:59,838 --> 00:05:02,339
Oh, thanks. I started smoking again.

122
00:05:05,244 --> 00:05:07,177
What the hell's wrong with you?

123
00:05:07,179 --> 00:05:08,991
You think it's okay for Billy Sparks

124
00:05:08,993 --> 00:05:10,066
to do your work?

125
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:11,157
I paid him.

126
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:13,584
I tried to give him two
dollars, but he only wanted one.

127
00:05:13,586 --> 00:05:16,453
Damn it, Georgie, I'm trying
to teach you responsibility.

128
00:05:16,455 --> 00:05:18,897
You can't just buy your way
out of everything in life.

129
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:19,951
You sure?

130
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:22,225
'Cause I'll give you ten bucks
to leave me alone right now.

131
00:05:22,227 --> 00:05:23,660
Go mow the lawn.

132
00:05:23,662 --> 00:05:25,295
I'm not gonna say it again.

133
00:05:25,297 --> 00:05:28,932
Fine. But I'm only doing this
so you'll get off my back.

134
00:05:28,934 --> 00:05:31,269
Oh, you'll know when I'm
on your back, little man.

135
00:05:32,805 --> 00:05:34,938
Now we can be hair twins.

136
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,240
Paige, you're supposed to
be doing science with me.

137
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:38,809
That's boring.

138
00:05:38,811 --> 00:05:40,744
I want to do something dangerous.

139
00:05:40,746 --> 00:05:43,380
This is dangerous. We
don't have an eye wash station.

140
00:05:43,382 --> 00:05:46,016
- Let's go to the mall.
- Mom doesn't like the mall.

141
00:05:46,018 --> 00:05:48,600
She says the mannequins
don't have enough clothes on,

142
00:05:48,602 --> 00:05:50,287
but I think it's 'cause we're poor.

143
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:52,990
We are poor. I do our taxes.

144
00:05:52,992 --> 00:05:54,858
Don't worry. I'll ask her.

145
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,560
Ever since my parents got divorced,

146
00:05:56,562 --> 00:05:57,995
people can't say no to me.

147
00:05:57,997 --> 00:06:00,063
My mom promised she would
take me to the mall to get me

148
00:06:00,065 --> 00:06:02,165
a new backpack, but she was so busy

149
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:03,800
cleaning my dad's
stuff out of the garage

150
00:06:03,802 --> 00:06:05,736
- that I think she forgot.
- Oh.

151
00:06:05,738 --> 00:06:09,072
Of course I can take
you. Anything you need.

152
00:06:09,074 --> 00:06:11,175
Thank you, Mrs. Cooper.

153
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,115
Will you marry me?

154
00:06:20,487 --> 00:06:22,587
Why are you taking a
backpack to the mall?

155
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:24,423
This is my mall safety kit.

156
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,892
Earplugs to drown out crowd noise,

157
00:06:27,894 --> 00:06:30,504
Wet-Naps to wipe down
escalator handrails,

158
00:06:30,506 --> 00:06:32,046
a compass, a map of the mall,

159
00:06:32,048 --> 00:06:33,826
and a whistle, in case I get lost

160
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:36,495
or approached by a woman
holding a perfume bottle.

161
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:38,531
You want to stuff him in there, right?

162
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:39,966
No.

163
00:06:42,537 --> 00:06:44,503
Okay, Paige,

164
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:46,501
where should we go to get your backpack?

165
00:06:46,503 --> 00:06:47,560
The Hello Kitty store.

166
00:06:47,562 --> 00:06:49,976
I would help you find it,
but this subpar mall map

167
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:51,580
isn't even oriented north.

168
00:06:51,582 --> 00:06:52,770
Let's go.

169
00:06:52,772 --> 00:06:55,028
All right, have fun at
the Hello Kitty store,

170
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,419
and meet me at the
fountain in half an hour.

171
00:06:57,421 --> 00:07:00,590
Just to be clear, there are
no actual kitties, right?

172
00:07:01,558 --> 00:07:03,758
I can't imagine talking to my dad

173
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,227
the way this kid talks to me.

174
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:08,130
I'd have had a belt on
my backside so fast...

175
00:07:08,132 --> 00:07:10,398
My dad was a hugger.

176
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,868
I had to tell him three
times to mow the lawn,

177
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,269
and he still gave me attitude.

178
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:17,339
He's going to school,
holding down a job.

179
00:07:17,341 --> 00:07:20,543
If he was my kid, I'd be proud of him.

180
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,613
I am proud of him.

181
00:07:24,615 --> 00:07:26,983
When he's not being a
total pain in my ass.

182
00:07:28,285 --> 00:07:30,886
You ever tell him you're proud?

183
00:07:30,888 --> 00:07:32,287
He knows.

184
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:35,056
I think it's important
for children to hear it.

185
00:07:35,058 --> 00:07:37,192
You don't even have kids.

186
00:07:37,194 --> 00:07:39,361
I teach and coach teenage boys.

187
00:07:39,363 --> 00:07:42,465
I also put up with
your childish nonsense.

188
00:07:44,334 --> 00:07:46,434
Georgie's just being
so damn disrespectful,

189
00:07:46,436 --> 00:07:47,836
I don't want to reward that.

190
00:07:47,838 --> 00:07:49,137
All right.

191
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,206
My father never said he was proud of me.

192
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,707
I turned out just fine.

193
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:57,479
George, I'm just trying
to have a nice day,

194
00:07:57,481 --> 00:07:59,247
make some white folks uncomfortable.

195
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:01,117
Can you please?

196
00:08:02,286 --> 00:08:06,121
♪ Bela Lugosi's dead... ♪

197
00:08:06,123 --> 00:08:08,623
This isn't the Hello Kitty store.

198
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,092
No. It's Hot Topic.

199
00:08:11,094 --> 00:08:13,461
- What's the topic, devil worship?
- Hey,

200
00:08:13,463 --> 00:08:15,197
did you know there's a bow
tie section in the back?

201
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,135
Why would they hide that in the back?

202
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:23,638
- Ooh.
- What's that?

203
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,307
Body glitter.

204
00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:27,699
That's so much better
than regular glitter.

205
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:28,777
Then buy it.

206
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:30,679
I don't have any money.

207
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:31,846
Then steal it.

208
00:08:31,848 --> 00:08:34,183
No, my mom would kill me.

209
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,410
Fine. Your mom can't punish me.

210
00:08:39,412 --> 00:08:40,768
I didn't see any bow ties,

211
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,324
just a shirt with a bad word on it.

212
00:08:42,326 --> 00:08:45,055
- What did you put in your pocket?
- Nothing.

213
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:47,028
Are you guys stealing?
Because if you are,

214
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,456
I am prepared to literally
blow the whistle on you...

215
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,557
Okay.

216
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:52,400
Okay.

217
00:08:52,402 --> 00:08:55,070
Relax, we were just playing around.

218
00:08:55,072 --> 00:08:57,272
- Let's just get out of here.
- Good.

219
00:08:57,274 --> 00:08:58,603
Everyone behind the counter

220
00:08:58,605 --> 00:08:59,943
has an earring where an earring

221
00:08:59,945 --> 00:09:01,276
does not belong.

222
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:03,310
Hey, Vern, looks like you're turning

223
00:09:03,312 --> 00:09:05,603
into quite the little shopper.

224
00:09:05,605 --> 00:09:06,781
Hey.

225
00:09:06,783 --> 00:09:08,250
I've already mowed the lawn.

226
00:09:08,252 --> 00:09:10,252
I know. Thanks for doing that.

227
00:09:10,254 --> 00:09:12,621
So what do you want?

228
00:09:12,623 --> 00:09:15,624
Well, I was thinking you
and I could go grab a burger.

229
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:17,292
Why?

230
00:09:17,294 --> 00:09:19,261
'Cause I thought it'd
be a nice thing to do.

231
00:09:19,263 --> 00:09:20,895
Which restaurant?

232
00:09:20,897 --> 00:09:22,631
Why does it matter?

233
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:24,081
Well, McDonald's burgers are fried,

234
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,567
and sometimes I like flame-broiled.

235
00:09:25,569 --> 00:09:28,169
Fine, we can go to Burger King.

236
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:30,524
I don't like the fries at Burger King.

237
00:09:30,526 --> 00:09:32,941
Ooh, Arby's has those curly fries.

238
00:09:32,943 --> 00:09:35,043
Shoot, they don't have burgers.

239
00:09:35,045 --> 00:09:37,545
Then let's go to Whataburger.

240
00:09:37,547 --> 00:09:40,650
Okay, but I hope you're not
this cranky the whole meal.

241
00:09:47,624 --> 00:09:48,990
So,

242
00:09:48,992 --> 00:09:51,526
we haven't really had a
chance to talk much lately.

243
00:09:51,528 --> 00:09:53,094
Why is it so hot in here?

244
00:09:53,096 --> 00:09:54,963
AC's busted.

245
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:56,464
Why don't you get it fixed?

246
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:58,868
'Cause I got better things
to spend my money on.

247
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:01,236
Anyway,

248
00:10:01,238 --> 00:10:03,285
what I wanted to say is,

249
00:10:03,287 --> 00:10:07,208
even though I'm not loving
your attitude lately,

250
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,077
I think it's great you got this job

251
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:11,414
and y-you're doing so well at it.

252
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,949
I'm proud of you.

253
00:10:14,951 --> 00:10:16,618
All right.

254
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,586
That's all you have to say?

255
00:10:18,588 --> 00:10:21,323
Well, maybe if I wasn't
sweating my balls off,

256
00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:22,691
I could think of something else.

257
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:25,293
Just stick your head out the window.

258
00:10:25,295 --> 00:10:27,396
If it's about money, I've got money.

259
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:31,767
It can even be a loan if
it makes you feel better.

260
00:10:33,203 --> 00:10:35,404
Don't you dare.

261
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:41,242
You said you're proud of my
job. I don't think you are.

262
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:42,977
You know what? Forget lunch.

263
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:44,245
Let's just go home.

264
00:10:44,247 --> 00:10:46,816
Smart. Save some money for your truck.

265
00:10:47,884 --> 00:10:49,217
That's it.

266
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:51,387
You're walking.

267
00:10:59,262 --> 00:11:03,201
I had survived a perilous
trip to the accessory store,

268
00:11:03,203 --> 00:11:07,603
but it turned out, the
real accessory was me.

269
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:13,262
I can't believe you stole.

270
00:11:13,264 --> 00:11:15,564
You walked out with it. You stole.

271
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:16,732
Why would I steal glitter?

272
00:11:16,734 --> 00:11:19,001
I already have a sparkling personality.

273
00:11:19,003 --> 00:11:20,502
Tell it to the cops.

274
00:11:20,504 --> 00:11:21,670
Or your cellmate.

275
00:11:21,672 --> 00:11:25,007
You're so smart. Why
are you acting like this?

276
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:26,775
Maybe I don't want to be smart.

277
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:29,411
I have to sit down.

278
00:11:29,413 --> 00:11:31,213
Being smart sucks.

279
00:11:31,215 --> 00:11:33,865
It's the reason we
moved here from Arkansas,

280
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:37,352
a-and my parents never yelled
at each other before that.

281
00:11:37,354 --> 00:11:41,266
It's just better to be normal.

282
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:45,137
It works for me. But I
also have good cheekbones.

283
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:52,885
You swim here?

284
00:11:52,887 --> 00:11:56,455
Dad kicked me out of his
truck. I had to walk back.

285
00:11:56,457 --> 00:11:59,191
What dumb thing did you say or do?

286
00:11:59,193 --> 00:12:01,393
How do you know I'm the
one who did something dumb?

287
00:12:01,395 --> 00:12:03,762
'Cause you kind of shine at it.

288
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,665
All I did is offer to pay to fix his AC.

289
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:09,034
And there it is. Dumb.

290
00:12:09,036 --> 00:12:10,135
What's wrong with that?

291
00:12:10,137 --> 00:12:11,403
Your dad is a grown man.

292
00:12:11,405 --> 00:12:13,906
He doesn't want his
kid giving him money.

293
00:12:13,908 --> 00:12:16,198
So he's glad I'm making money,

294
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,544
but I'm not allowed to use
that money to help him out?

295
00:12:18,546 --> 00:12:20,901
- I don't get it.
- Well, someday, when you have

296
00:12:20,903 --> 00:12:24,249
a bunch of sweaty, mullet-headed
kids running around, you will.

297
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:26,218
Oh, I ain't never having kids.

298
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,688
Well, that's the smartest
thing I ever heard you say.

299
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,691
Thank you.

300
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,934
John Sturgis at your service.

301
00:12:41,936 --> 00:12:43,736
Dr. Sturgis, Sheldon Cooper.

302
00:12:43,738 --> 00:12:45,003
Hello, Sheldon.

303
00:12:45,005 --> 00:12:46,205
How are you doing?

304
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,712
Confused, upset, annoyed,

305
00:12:48,714 --> 00:12:50,609
and potentially in trouble with the law.

306
00:12:50,611 --> 00:12:54,213
Well, in which order would
you like to handle this?

307
00:12:54,215 --> 00:12:55,547
Let's start with confused,

308
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:57,950
but if we hear sirens
approaching, we'll jump ahead.

309
00:12:57,952 --> 00:13:00,085
Great. What's on your mind?

310
00:13:00,087 --> 00:13:02,454
Do you ever wish that you weren't smart?

311
00:13:02,456 --> 00:13:05,691
So I would be short, lonely and stupid?

312
00:13:05,693 --> 00:13:07,593
No, that seems worse.

313
00:13:07,595 --> 00:13:08,827
Why do you ask?

314
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,496
Do you remember Paige?

315
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,531
Of course, brilliant little girl.

316
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:14,390
I know, but she says that she doesn't

317
00:13:14,392 --> 00:13:15,701
want to be smart anymore.

318
00:13:15,703 --> 00:13:20,205
Well, perhaps she's experiencing
some sort of identity crisis.

319
00:13:20,207 --> 00:13:23,066
Is it possible her ex is dating someone

320
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:26,912
who seems better for her
in every imaginable way?

321
00:13:26,914 --> 00:13:28,847
I'm confused.

322
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,415
So am I.

323
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:33,519
How do I make her understand
that being smart is the best?

324
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:39,024
Might I suggest, instead of
trying to fix her problem,

325
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,959
you just listen?

326
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:44,329
When I was in the psychiatric
ward, I learned that people

327
00:13:44,331 --> 00:13:48,967
who are struggling emotionally
often just need to be heard.

328
00:13:48,969 --> 00:13:50,769
Hmm.

329
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:53,672
Sounds difficult, but
I suppose I could try.

330
00:13:53,674 --> 00:13:56,736
Another thing I learned in the
hospital is that some people

331
00:13:56,738 --> 00:14:00,026
believe there are weird
mole men living in tunnels

332
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:01,713
deep inside the earth.

333
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,750
Well, this has been mostly helpful.

334
00:14:04,752 --> 00:14:06,719
And you're mostly welcome.

335
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,108
You made it.

336
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,111
Yeah, I made it.

337
00:14:22,536 --> 00:14:24,537
Sorry.

338
00:14:26,473 --> 00:14:28,474
No problem.

339
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:36,181
Ow.

340
00:14:36,183 --> 00:14:39,918
Ow. Is there a way to do
this so it doesn't hurt?

341
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,920
No. Beauty is pain.

342
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,456
Boy George must really suffer.

343
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,468
Missy, I need a moment with Paige.

344
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,893
Make it quick.

345
00:14:47,895 --> 00:14:49,896
I'm only half-beautiful.

346
00:14:53,868 --> 00:14:54,900
Yeah?

347
00:14:54,902 --> 00:14:56,521
I'm listening.

348
00:14:56,523 --> 00:14:57,569
To what?

349
00:14:57,571 --> 00:14:58,737
To you.

350
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:00,105
I'm not saying anything.

351
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,227
Well, if you wanted to say
anything, I'd be listening.

352
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,376
But I don't want to say anything.

353
00:15:04,378 --> 00:15:06,879
And I don't want to be
listening, but here we are.

354
00:15:06,881 --> 00:15:08,247
Are you feeling better yet?

355
00:15:08,249 --> 00:15:12,785
You're being weird, and
not in the usual way.

356
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,822
Guess that's my life now.

357
00:15:16,824 --> 00:15:18,424
What do you mean?

358
00:15:20,261 --> 00:15:22,861
Everyone is acting weird.

359
00:15:22,863 --> 00:15:28,066
My mom is going on dates and
my dad is acting like a child.

360
00:15:28,068 --> 00:15:31,738
My sister's crying all the time.

361
00:15:32,773 --> 00:15:34,406
I just

362
00:15:34,408 --> 00:15:40,012
wish that everything could
go back to the way it was.

363
00:15:40,014 --> 00:15:43,348
I don't think it will.

364
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:46,118
It turned out I was
really good at listening.

365
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,923
The trick is to sit there, and
when you want to leave, don't.

366
00:15:50,925 --> 00:15:54,493
I have to live in two separate houses.

367
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:59,331
And my grandma says the
meanest things about my dad.

368
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,081
I know that everyone is upset

369
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,802
that I'm not doing well in school.

370
00:16:03,804 --> 00:16:07,840
It's just hard to care.

371
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:13,078
Everything that used
to seem important to me

372
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,550
just... doesn't anymore.

373
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,590
So I guess, really, I just feel alone.

374
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,696
That sounds hard.

375
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,932
Yeah... it is.

376
00:16:33,934 --> 00:16:35,934
Dr. Sturgis was right.

377
00:16:35,936 --> 00:16:40,439
There was nothing I could do
to fix this, or so I thought.

378
00:16:40,441 --> 00:16:42,775
Can I offer you a hot beverage?

379
00:16:43,811 --> 00:16:45,477
That would be nice.

380
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:47,747
Be right back.

381
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,149
The "Hot Beverage of Comfort"

382
00:16:51,151 --> 00:16:53,235
would become my go-to method

383
00:16:53,237 --> 00:16:55,454
of dealing with someone
in emotional distress.

384
00:16:55,456 --> 00:16:57,356
And it always worked.

385
00:16:57,358 --> 00:16:59,864
Except when my wife was in labor,

386
00:16:59,866 --> 00:17:03,069
where it was suggested I
throw it in my own face.

387
00:17:07,853 --> 00:17:10,382
- What you doing?
- Paige is feeling sad,

388
00:17:10,384 --> 00:17:12,830
so I'm making her a hot beverage.

389
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:15,033
Oh. You're a good kid.

390
00:17:17,598 --> 00:17:19,599
I'm proud of you.

391
00:17:20,801 --> 00:17:22,400
Thank you.

392
00:17:22,402 --> 00:17:23,902
Of all my accomplishments,

393
00:17:23,904 --> 00:17:26,843
I don't know why he
singled this moment out,

394
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,312
but I'm glad he did.

395
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:30,417
Sup?

395
00:17:31,305 --> 00:18:31,232

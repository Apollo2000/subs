1
00:00:00,617 --> 00:00:02,085
Presenting...

2
00:00:02,088 --> 00:00:06,132
"Sheldon Cooper's Top Five Sources
of News From My Childhood".

3
00:00:06,135 --> 00:00:07,320
Number five:

4
00:00:07,323 --> 00:00:09,762
Star Trek Fan Club Magazine.

5
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:13,523
Mom, DeForest Kelley's favorite
episode is "The Empath."

6
00:00:13,526 --> 00:00:14,873
Good to know.

7
00:00:14,876 --> 00:00:16,896
Number four: the Weather Cube

8
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:18,359
from RadioShack.

9
00:00:18,362 --> 00:00:20,362
The humidity is 90%

10
00:00:20,365 --> 00:00:23,114
with a dew point of 79.5 degrees.

11
00:00:23,117 --> 00:00:24,223
Mom!

12
00:00:24,226 --> 00:00:27,020
The dew point is 79.5 degrees.

13
00:00:27,023 --> 00:00:28,338
Okay.

14
00:00:28,341 --> 00:00:29,686
Number three:

15
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:31,646
The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour.

16
00:00:31,648 --> 00:00:33,648
Such a great theme song.

17
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:36,912
♪ Buh-buh-bum. ♪

18
00:00:36,915 --> 00:00:38,086
Number two:

19
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:40,306
Meemaw after a few beers.

20
00:00:40,308 --> 00:00:42,483
It took a while, but we
finally picked a new name

21
00:00:42,485 --> 00:00:45,226
for my bowling team: The Ball Busters.

22
00:00:46,053 --> 00:00:47,367
Hey, Mom.

23
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,837
Guess what Meemaw named her
bowling team? The Ball...

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,187
And the number one source

25
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:53,015
of news from my childhood:

26
00:00:53,017 --> 00:00:55,874
the bulletin board at the train store.

27
00:00:57,531 --> 00:01:00,387
News about trains in
a store full of trains.

28
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,589
Yummy.

29
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:04,505
How did this not make The
MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour?

30
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:08,725
The train museum's looking for a docent.

31
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:09,960
What's a docent?

32
00:01:09,963 --> 00:01:11,512
It's a person in a museum

33
00:01:11,514 --> 00:01:13,516
who gives informationon the exhibits.

34
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:16,942
Do you think they'd let
someone your age do that?

35
00:01:16,945 --> 00:01:19,250
Why not? I have a high school diploma.

36
00:01:19,253 --> 00:01:20,426
True.

37
00:01:20,429 --> 00:01:22,435
I know more about trains than anybody.

38
00:01:22,437 --> 00:01:23,611
True.

39
00:01:23,613 --> 00:01:25,047
And I have the unique ability

40
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,051
to wear people down until I get my way.

41
00:01:28,095 --> 00:01:29,923
So true.

42
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:37,842
Hello. I understand you're
looking for a docent.

43
00:01:37,844 --> 00:01:39,844
I'm 11 years old, but you should know

44
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:41,163
I have a high school diploma

45
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,805
and I know more about
trains than anybody.

46
00:01:43,807 --> 00:01:46,198
You still sound on the fence.

47
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,984
It was time to break
out my unique ability.

48
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:51,508
Let me tell you about
every model train I own

49
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,249
and what each of them means to me.

50
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:55,033
The first locomotive I ever received...

51
00:01:55,035 --> 00:01:57,601
Wouldn't you know it,
47 short minutes later,

52
00:01:57,603 --> 00:01:59,429
I got the job.

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,074

- You put your cleats in the truck?
- Yep.

56
00:02:20,602 --> 00:02:22,938
We should hit the road
soon. It's a long drive.

57
00:02:22,941 --> 00:02:25,933
- Okay.
- I got your lunches here.

58
00:02:25,936 --> 00:02:27,287
Extra Fruit Roll-Ups?

59
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,798
- You each got two.
- Thank you.

60
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:29,810
Thank you.

61
00:02:29,813 --> 00:02:32,243
- What time is the game?
- 12:30.

62
00:02:32,246 --> 00:02:33,811
Why are we talking about baseball

63
00:02:33,813 --> 00:02:35,685
and not my impending docent-hood?

64
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,295
Who wants to tell him it's stupid?

65
00:02:37,298 --> 00:02:39,503
- Leave it alone.
- And why do they make you wear

66
00:02:39,506 --> 00:02:40,949
that goofy costume?

67
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:43,495
Ha. They don't. This is all me.

68
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:45,301
What do you got going on today?

69
00:02:45,303 --> 00:02:46,607
Ooh, laundry,

70
00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:48,652
grocery shopping, vacuuming.

71
00:02:48,654 --> 00:02:50,904
I might go nuts and
dust the picture frames.

72
00:02:50,907 --> 00:02:53,429
Well, nice. Everybody's
doing something they love.

73
00:02:53,432 --> 00:02:57,007
Sheldon, you sure about this?

74
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,663
Yes, leave the crusts on.

75
00:02:59,665 --> 00:03:01,362
I'm a docent now.

76
00:03:02,973 --> 00:03:04,973
Thanks for bringing me.

77
00:03:04,975 --> 00:03:06,452
Hey, it got me out
of driving all the way

78
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:08,935
to Missy's game; I
should be thanking you.

79
00:03:13,203 --> 00:03:15,116
My little knuckles
might not be cutting it.

80
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:16,452
Would you give it a go?

81
00:03:16,455 --> 00:03:18,421
Sure.

82
00:03:18,424 --> 00:03:19,510
How's that?

83
00:03:19,513 --> 00:03:21,249
Four knocks. Bold.

84
00:03:22,688 --> 00:03:24,557
Hello, hello.

85
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:28,126
Volunteer docent Sheldon
Cooper reporting for duty.

86
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,824
Welcome aboard.

87
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:33,003
Train nomenclature right
out of the gate. Promising.

88
00:03:35,817 --> 00:03:37,710
I like your conductor's uniform.

89
00:03:37,713 --> 00:03:40,485
You know what they say.
Dress for the job you want.

90
00:03:40,488 --> 00:03:42,522
Do I get an "ask me" button, too?

91
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:45,178
Well, thank you for
asking, and yes, you do.

92
00:03:45,181 --> 00:03:47,399
I'll be right back.

93
00:03:47,402 --> 00:03:48,966
Do you see that bell?

94
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:52,257
That's from Texas and New
Orleans locomotive number 701.

95
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,129
I'd tell you more, but
you haven't contributed

96
00:03:54,132 --> 00:03:55,553
the suggested donation.

97
00:04:03,686 --> 00:04:07,513
Number 701 was built in 1930by
the Baldwin Locomotive Works.

98
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:10,821
It was a superheated 4-8-4 class GS-1

99
00:04:10,823 --> 00:04:12,823
- with 7...
- I want my money back.

100
00:04:12,825 --> 00:04:14,216
Here you go.

101
00:04:14,218 --> 00:04:15,772
Thank you.

102
00:04:15,775 --> 00:04:17,621
I know you're supposed
to pick me up at 4:00,

103
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:18,873
but I may live here now.

104
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,790
Send me a Christmas card.

105
00:04:21,834 --> 00:04:24,139
I'm glad Mom didn't come.

106
00:04:24,142 --> 00:04:25,358
Why's that?

107
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:27,320
I can spit when I'm on the mound.

108
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:29,965
You can hock up anything you want today.

109
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:33,583
- Not here.
- Aw.

110
00:04:33,585 --> 00:04:35,655
We need to stop so I can pee.

111
00:04:35,658 --> 00:04:37,919
I told you to pee
before we left the house.

112
00:04:37,922 --> 00:04:39,980
That was an hour and a half ago.

113
00:04:39,983 --> 00:04:41,944
Can't you hold it?

114
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:43,581
I may spit like a man,

115
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:45,522
but I have the bladder of a little girl.

116
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:51,748
I'm going to work.

117
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:53,838
Okay, have fun.

118
00:04:53,841 --> 00:04:56,189
What-what time do you
think you'll be back?

119
00:04:56,192 --> 00:04:57,409
Before dinner.

120
00:04:57,412 --> 00:04:59,066
See you then.

121
00:05:06,386 --> 00:05:09,116
And my day off begins.

122
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:11,413
Just let me know if
you have any questions.

123
00:05:13,494 --> 00:05:15,475
This is a very nice builder's plate.

124
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:17,304
How can you be sure it's not a replica?

125
00:05:17,307 --> 00:05:19,218
Now, that is a great question.

126
00:05:19,221 --> 00:05:22,196
Thank you. I also know
the answer. Do you?

127
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,772
Well, there's, uh, rust
and soot on the back of it

128
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:28,942
from when it was mounted
to the engine's smokebox.

129
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:31,336
Very good.

130
00:05:31,338 --> 00:05:33,233
Ah, the 1937

131
00:05:33,236 --> 00:05:35,062
Santa Fe diesel.

132
00:05:35,065 --> 00:05:36,760
I've always loved that paint scheme.

133
00:05:36,763 --> 00:05:39,039
I wonder if they had a name for it.

134
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:40,694
Cat's Whiskers.

135
00:05:40,697 --> 00:05:41,725
Correct.

136
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:43,147
Ha! Two for two.

137
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,653
Did you know that the word "train"

138
00:05:44,656 --> 00:05:46,482
comes from the French verb traîner,

139
00:05:46,484 --> 00:05:48,186
which means to draw or drag?

140
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:50,493
Well, I just learned something.

141
00:05:50,496 --> 00:05:52,155
Well, if you enjoy learning things,

142
00:05:52,158 --> 00:05:55,319
then you and I are on the
fast track to friendship.

143
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:56,546
Speaking of fast tracks,

144
00:05:56,549 --> 00:05:58,999
the Japanese bullet
train, or Shinkansen...

145
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,598
Ready to roll?

146
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:17,559
Not really.

147
00:06:18,634 --> 00:06:20,113
What's wrong?

148
00:06:21,064 --> 00:06:22,892
It happened.

149
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:25,836
What happened?

150
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,968
That thing that happens to girls

151
00:06:30,971 --> 00:06:33,671
when they're becoming young ladies.

152
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,572
What? Now?

153
00:06:37,575 --> 00:06:39,707
I'm not happy about it, either.

154
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,555
Should we go home?

155
00:06:42,558 --> 00:06:44,171
I'm pitching in an hour.

156
00:06:44,174 --> 00:06:45,889
I... you think that's a good idea?

157
00:06:45,892 --> 00:06:47,065
Maybe you need to lie down.

158
00:06:47,068 --> 00:06:48,241
I don't need to lie down.

159
00:06:48,244 --> 00:06:50,414
Okay, well, maybe I need to lie down.

160
00:06:54,476 --> 00:06:56,824
Okay, we're gonna find a pay
phone and call your mother.

161
00:06:56,826 --> 00:06:58,613
She's not here right
now. What can she do?

162
00:06:58,616 --> 00:07:00,652
Well, I don't know what to do.

163
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:03,264
We're gonna go to a
drugstore and get what I need.

164
00:07:03,267 --> 00:07:05,267
Go to a drug store.

165
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:07,313
Okay, I can do that.

166
00:07:07,315 --> 00:07:10,011
Breathe. We're gonna get through this.

167
00:07:13,277 --> 00:07:14,798
It's almost opening time.

168
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,147
Can I flip the sign?

169
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:17,238
Have at it.

170
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:23,851
Five, four,

171
00:07:23,853 --> 00:07:27,333
three, two, one.

172
00:07:27,335 --> 00:07:29,613
We're officially open for business.

173
00:07:36,692 --> 00:07:39,040
Anticlimactic.

174
00:07:45,596 --> 00:07:47,946
Get him, Dalton. Get him.

175
00:07:49,357 --> 00:07:50,586
Mary Cooper,

176
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:52,314
what are you doing?

177
00:07:52,316 --> 00:07:53,359
Nothing.

178
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:55,056
Why are you watching Road House?

179
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,824
Why aren't you at work?

180
00:07:56,827 --> 00:07:58,406
I asked you first, and my question

181
00:07:58,409 --> 00:07:59,758
is way more interesting.

182
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:02,411
It was just on.

183
00:08:02,413 --> 00:08:03,934
I don't even know what that is.

184
00:08:03,936 --> 00:08:06,374
Then how'd you know his name's Dalton?

185
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,289
I don't have to explain myself to you.

186
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,899
This is a pretty dirty movie.

187
00:08:11,901 --> 00:08:15,032
How do you know? It is rated R.

188
00:08:15,034 --> 00:08:17,208
For violence, language
and sexual content.

189
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,865
You should be ashamed of yourself.

190
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:26,141
Nothing to be embarrassed about.

191
00:08:26,144 --> 00:08:28,113
It's perfectly natural.
Perfectly normal.

192
00:08:28,116 --> 00:08:29,612
Dad, I know.

193
00:08:29,614 --> 00:08:31,222
I'm telling myself.

194
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:33,399
Uh...

195
00:08:33,401 --> 00:08:35,488
How much money you need?

196
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,490
I'm not going in there. You are.

197
00:08:37,492 --> 00:08:39,909
Why can't you go? It's embarrassing.

198
00:08:39,912 --> 00:08:42,206
You just said it wasn't embarrassing.

199
00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:43,730
Well, it is and I lied.

200
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:47,064
Excuse me.

201
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:50,198
Hello. Welcome to the
Lone Star Train Museum.

202
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,721
I'm Docent Sheldon Cooper.

203
00:08:51,723 --> 00:08:53,735
If you have any questions...

204
00:08:53,738 --> 00:08:55,305
You know where the bathroom is?

205
00:08:55,308 --> 00:08:57,727
Indeed I do. You'll want to chug along

206
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,727
past our authentic 1928

207
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,024
Southern Pacific Sunset limited whistle,

208
00:09:02,027 --> 00:09:04,070
then keep going past
our conductor's uniform,

209
00:09:04,073 --> 00:09:06,213
which was worn on the
Texas and Pacific Railway.

210
00:09:06,216 --> 00:09:07,258
Then you'll come upon...

211
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:09,216
Son, I have to take a leak.

212
00:09:09,219 --> 00:09:11,399
- It's in the back.
- Thank you.

213
00:09:11,402 --> 00:09:13,657
And our toilets flush,
unlike the ones on trains

214
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,703
before 1889.

215
00:09:17,662 --> 00:09:19,401
This is a genuinelocomotive bell

216
00:09:19,403 --> 00:09:22,180
from Texas and New Orleans number 701.

217
00:09:22,183 --> 00:09:24,753
Now there's a proper technique
to make the purest sound.

218
00:09:24,756 --> 00:09:26,277
Most people don't know how to do that.

219
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,844
But you're in luck, because I do.

220
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:37,940
You want to know more
about the Cotton Belt,

221
00:09:37,943 --> 00:09:39,508
there's plenty in here.

222
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,293
Although the facts in
that brochure are suspect.

223
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:44,383
Sheldon, I, uh,

224
00:09:44,385 --> 00:09:46,271
I wrote this brochure.

225
00:09:46,274 --> 00:09:48,317
While the origins of the
Southern Pacific go back

226
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,368
to 1848, the company wasn't
formally started until 1865.

227
00:09:53,753 --> 00:09:56,667
And before you reprint
these, we should talk fonts.

228
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,964
See? It's all in the wrist.

229
00:10:04,094 --> 00:10:06,316
And early trains used
the drop chute toilet,

230
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:09,233
also called the hopper toilet,
which was really just a hole...

231
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:12,280
Couldn't you just
listen to this all day?

232
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,508
So how many times have
you seen Road House?

233
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,990
Sorry, can't hear you.

234
00:10:24,993 --> 00:10:26,513
More or less than five?

235
00:10:26,516 --> 00:10:28,081
'Cause that'show many
times I've seen it.

236
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,075
That's how many years
you're gonna be grounded

237
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:31,947
if you don't drop it right now.

238
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,776
Does Dad know you like this movie?

239
00:10:34,912 --> 00:10:37,608
No, and it is gonna stay that way.

240
00:10:37,611 --> 00:10:40,133
- Why?
- Because it is not

241
00:10:40,136 --> 00:10:41,875
something I should be watching.

242
00:10:41,878 --> 00:10:43,487
Then why are you watching it?

243
00:10:45,402 --> 00:10:48,925
It is a guilty pleasure,
so will you drop it now?

244
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:51,058
Relax.

245
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,105
I ain't gonna tell nobody.

246
00:10:55,543 --> 00:10:56,759
Thank you.

247
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:59,155
I think it's awesome you like it.

248
00:11:02,506 --> 00:11:04,240
It is pretty cool how Dalton

249
00:11:04,243 --> 00:11:05,764
doesn't drive his Mercedes to the bar

250
00:11:05,767 --> 00:11:07,856
'cause he knows they're gonna trash it.

251
00:11:07,859 --> 00:11:09,119
Dalton's no dummy.

252
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:10,622
No, sir.

253
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,410
It's right over there in aisle two.

254
00:11:15,563 --> 00:11:17,247
Find everything you need today?

255
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,773
Yeah, think so.

256
00:11:31,883 --> 00:11:34,405
You don't know what
you're doing, do you?

257
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:36,233
No, ma'am.

258
00:11:36,235 --> 00:11:37,630
Would you like some help?

259
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:38,974
Yes, ma'am, thank you, ma'am.

260
00:11:38,977 --> 00:11:40,936
Okay.

261
00:11:45,897 --> 00:11:47,723
Uh...

262
00:11:47,725 --> 00:11:48,919
we need to talk.

263
00:11:48,922 --> 00:11:50,812
About this bell? You got it.

264
00:11:50,815 --> 00:11:53,642
Did you know different
engineers would often...

265
00:11:53,644 --> 00:11:55,601
Son?

266
00:11:55,603 --> 00:11:57,820
You're a sweet kid, but...

267
00:11:57,822 --> 00:11:59,692
I don't think this is working out.

268
00:11:59,694 --> 00:12:01,279
What? Why?

269
00:12:01,282 --> 00:12:03,396
I-I know everything there
is to know about trains.

270
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:05,784
Well, you see now, that
there is the problem.

271
00:12:05,787 --> 00:12:08,740
People, when they come
here, they want to enjoy it.

272
00:12:08,743 --> 00:12:10,960
They don't want to get
lectured in the bathroom.

273
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,818
And you have been correcting me

274
00:12:12,821 --> 00:12:15,013
in front of the visitors
all morning long.

275
00:12:15,016 --> 00:12:16,529
Would you prefer I send you a memo

276
00:12:16,532 --> 00:12:18,014
of your mistakes at the end of the day?

277
00:12:18,016 --> 00:12:19,146
- No.
- Because that's what I did

278
00:12:19,148 --> 00:12:20,248
for the teachers at my school.

279
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,615
I think it brought us all closer.

280
00:12:21,618 --> 00:12:23,053
Sheldon, it's great to have knowledge.

281
00:12:23,055 --> 00:12:25,926
But you don't need to
show it off all the time.

282
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:27,458
Oh, I don't mind.

283
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,290
You see, trains are all
about balance, right?

284
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,328
Now you put too much
water into a steam engine,

285
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:35,742
it can't do its job.

286
00:12:35,745 --> 00:12:38,643
You let that water run
low... Boom, it'll blow up.

287
00:12:38,646 --> 00:12:41,081
Now, a good engineer

288
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,605
makes sure he uses just
the right amount of water.

289
00:12:43,607 --> 00:12:46,042
Not too little, not too much.

290
00:12:46,044 --> 00:12:48,525
That make sense?

291
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:51,657
The fireman adjusts the
water, not the engineer.

292
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,773
And then he took my "ask me" button.

293
00:12:53,776 --> 00:12:55,922
He didn't even ask me. He just took it.

294
00:13:00,353 --> 00:13:03,136
Everybody gets fired
for something eventually.

295
00:13:03,138 --> 00:13:05,182
For being too good at their job?

296
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,576
Well, Moon Pie, sometimes you just get

297
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:11,144
too excited about sharing
the facts in your head.

298
00:13:11,146 --> 00:13:13,669
But learning facts is the ant's pants.

299
00:13:13,671 --> 00:13:15,323
Which is the Australian derivation

300
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:16,664
of the bee's knees.

301
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:18,020
See, you just learned something.

302
00:13:18,023 --> 00:13:20,240
And wasn't that the cat's pajamas?

303
00:13:20,242 --> 00:13:23,505
Alls I'm saying is people
aren't always in the mood.

304
00:13:23,507 --> 00:13:25,115
Well, they should be.

305
00:13:25,117 --> 00:13:27,422
I'm happy to learn any fact at any time.

306
00:13:27,424 --> 00:13:28,858
Is that so?

307
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,208
Yes.

308
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,862
Grab my knitting bag.

309
00:13:32,864 --> 00:13:34,849
I don't recommend
driving while knitting.

310
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:36,779
Your reflexes aren't
what they used to be.

311
00:13:36,781 --> 00:13:38,868
Just look in the bag!

312
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,478
Did you know

313
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,002
that there are three
different kinds of yarn?

314
00:13:43,004 --> 00:13:44,133
I didn't.

315
00:13:44,136 --> 00:13:47,310
You got your animal, like wool.

316
00:13:47,313 --> 00:13:48,921
Your plant, like cotton.

317
00:13:48,923 --> 00:13:51,359
And your synthetic, like acrylic.

318
00:13:51,361 --> 00:13:52,490
Interesting.

319
00:13:52,492 --> 00:13:53,839
You think so?

320
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:54,922
I'm glad to hear that.

321
00:13:54,925 --> 00:13:58,250
Because each one of them
has plusses and minuses,

322
00:13:58,253 --> 00:14:00,367
and you're about to hear them all

323
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,634
in mind-numbing detail.

324
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:09,420
Nothing to worry about.

325
00:14:09,422 --> 00:14:11,553
- We got this.
- Really?

326
00:14:11,555 --> 00:14:12,947
Everything you need's right here.

327
00:14:13,992 --> 00:14:15,733
You're the best.

328
00:14:16,777 --> 00:14:18,734
Come on, I'll show you
where the bathroom is.

329
00:14:18,736 --> 00:14:20,431
Oh, and there's a very helpful cashier

330
00:14:20,433 --> 00:14:21,911
named Gretchen you need to hug.

331
00:14:21,913 --> 00:14:23,088
Come on.

332
00:14:23,805 --> 00:14:25,175
Here she is, Gretchen.

333
00:14:25,177 --> 00:14:27,133
Another way

334
00:14:27,135 --> 00:14:29,440
to cast on in knitting

335
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:31,399
is called the slingshot.

336
00:14:31,401 --> 00:14:33,270
Did you know the
Wham-O company was named

337
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,490
after its first product,
the Wham-O Slingshot?

338
00:14:35,492 --> 00:14:38,144
I'm the one saying the facts right now.

339
00:14:38,146 --> 00:14:40,146
Unless you're tired of hearing them?

340
00:14:40,148 --> 00:14:41,911
Sick of learning? Never.

341
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,883
Well, that's too bad.

342
00:14:43,886 --> 00:14:47,022
How awesome was it when he
fights those four guys at once?

343
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:48,894
They were asking for it.

344
00:14:48,896 --> 00:14:50,983
Dalton doesn't fight unless he has to.

345
00:14:50,985 --> 00:14:52,602
True, 'cause when the doctor says,

346
00:14:52,605 --> 00:14:54,509
"How many of these fights
you win?" he says...

347
00:14:54,511 --> 00:14:56,467
Nobody ever wins in a fight.

348
00:14:59,472 --> 00:15:02,299
Mm, and I like how smart he is.

349
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,266
But doesn't feel like
he has to show it off.

350
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:05,312
No kidding.

351
00:15:05,315 --> 00:15:06,868
Maybe Sheldon should watch it.

352
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:10,567
Hey, what was Dalton's third
rule of being a good bouncer?

353
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,309
Be nice.

354
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,878
That's right.

355
00:15:16,314 --> 00:15:18,793
I think Dad would love that
you're into stuff like this.

356
00:15:18,796 --> 00:15:20,622
I'm sure he would.

357
00:15:20,624 --> 00:15:23,102
He took me to see Mad Max twice.

358
00:15:23,104 --> 00:15:24,234
Really?

359
00:15:24,236 --> 00:15:25,844
Actually...

360
00:15:25,846 --> 00:15:28,151
the second time, we
couldn't find a sitter,

361
00:15:28,153 --> 00:15:29,805
so we brought you along.

362
00:15:29,807 --> 00:15:31,328
How old was I?

363
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:33,504
I don't know... four?

364
00:15:33,506 --> 00:15:35,463
No wonder I'm so cool.

365
00:15:35,465 --> 00:15:37,597
So, why you hiding it?

366
00:15:38,536 --> 00:15:41,711
Well, 'cause I'm supposed
to be a good Christian.

367
00:15:41,714 --> 00:15:44,805
Clearly this is something
I need to work on.

368
00:15:44,808 --> 00:15:48,692
Well, before you fix it,
you've got to watch Die Hard 2.

369
00:15:48,695 --> 00:15:51,916
Bruce Willis stabs a guy
in the head with an icicle.

370
00:15:53,918 --> 00:15:58,398
Now, circular knitting
produces a seamless tube.

371
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,270
You already told me that.

372
00:16:00,272 --> 00:16:02,533
Oh, did I?

373
00:16:02,535 --> 00:16:04,709
Can we circle back to
double-pointed needles?

374
00:16:04,711 --> 00:16:06,363
I have a follow-up question.

375
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,367
Hold that thought.

376
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:17,896
Strike two!

377
00:16:17,898 --> 00:16:19,681
One more!

378
00:16:19,683 --> 00:16:21,511
Just like that!

379
00:16:26,157 --> 00:16:27,813
Strike three, you're out.

380
00:16:27,816 --> 00:16:29,864
There you go! Ha!

381
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:31,693
That's how you do it!

382
00:16:31,695 --> 00:16:33,042
Is that your little girl?

383
00:16:33,044 --> 00:16:35,046
That's my little lady.

384
00:16:40,573 --> 00:16:42,266
Well, sometimes.

385
00:16:46,182 --> 00:16:49,210
Carrying the stuffing out of the
Caddy was easy. Using it to stop

386
00:16:49,213 --> 00:16:51,956
- the guys chasing us...
- The kids are asleep.

387
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,610
Gasoline would help.

388
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,569
- Always does...
- You gonna watch that?

389
00:16:55,571 --> 00:16:57,005
Well, it's MacGyver.

390
00:16:57,007 --> 00:16:59,094
He makes stuff out of other stuff.

391
00:16:59,096 --> 00:17:00,835
Sort of a homemade mortar.

392
00:17:00,837 --> 00:17:02,796
Why, did you want to
watch something else?

393
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,060
I thought maybe we could watch a movie.

394
00:17:07,148 --> 00:17:09,191
Sure, yeah, which one?

395
00:17:09,193 --> 00:17:11,935
Um... I don't know.

396
00:17:13,023 --> 00:17:15,154
I heard that that movie Road House

397
00:17:15,156 --> 00:17:16,981
is supposed to be good.

398
00:17:16,983 --> 00:17:18,548
What's it about?

399
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,855
I think it's about a guy,

400
00:17:20,857 --> 00:17:23,684
um... Dalton.

401
00:17:23,686 --> 00:17:25,635
Who's a bouncer

402
00:17:25,638 --> 00:17:27,377
who has to clean up a bar

403
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,168
that's been overrun
by a bunch of bad guys.

404
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:32,788
Oh, yeah, it's got that guy
that looks like Georgie in it.

405
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,260
No, he doesn't.

406
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:35,826
Are you kidding?

407
00:17:35,828 --> 00:17:37,480
He looks exactly like him.

408
00:17:43,923 --> 00:17:45,923
Let's just watch MacGyver.

409
00:17:45,925 --> 00:17:47,579
Cool.

1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,423
<i>Some people
have said I'm overly sensitive.</i>

2
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:11,762
What now?

3
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:14,223
Missy gave me cinnamon gum!

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,394
Sure, sure.

5
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:20,604
<i>And by some people,
I mean everyone.</i>

6
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,007
<i>While I may not be</i>
X-Men <i>material...</i>

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,405
<i>...I have always possessed
unusually heightened senses.</i>

8
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:30,489
Ew.

9
00:00:31,157 --> 00:00:34,160
<i>Georgie,
put your shoes back on!</i>

10
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:35,786
He can't smell this.

11
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,329
<i>Yes, I can!</i>

12
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:40,458
<i>I also had
extraordinary hearing.</i>

13
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:45,546
<i>During dinner, I could tune out
the cacophony of chewing,</i>

14
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,298
<i>slurping,</i>

15
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:51,927
<i>chewing, cutlery scraping
against plates,</i>

16
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:53,679
<i>chewing,</i>

17
00:00:53,763 --> 00:00:55,014
<i>and my father's heavy breathing</i>

18
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:56,537
<i>as he wrestled
with a ketchup bottle.</i>

19
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:02,438
<i>But tonight, there was
one sound I couldn't tune out.</i>

20
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:08,486
Why aren't you
eating, Sheldon?

21
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,864
How can I with that
horrible noise?

22
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:13,199
What noise?

23
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:15,868
That irritating,
high-pitched buzz.

24
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,495
I don't hear nothin'.

25
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:18,662
Me, neither.

26
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,414
How can you not?

27
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:21,499
Wait.

28
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:22,582
I think I hear it.

29
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,335
- You do?
- Yeah.

30
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,253
It's coming out of your face.

31
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:32,843
I guess I hear a little hum.

32
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:34,720
Refrigerators make
noise, Sheldon.

33
00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:37,306
This is new. It's never
made this sound before.

34
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:38,849
We should call a repairman.

35
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,143
I'm not spending money
on a fridge that's workin'.

36
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:43,938
Then think of it as spending
money on my mental stability.

37
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,440
Ignore it, Sheldon.

38
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:50,027
<i>Ignoring things that irritate
me isn't my strong suit.</i>

39
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:53,280
<i>Obsessively fixating on them...</i>

40
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:56,283
<i>now that's what gets me
out of bed in the morning.</i>

41
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:59,203
<i>♪♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪♪</i>

42
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:02,039
<i>♪♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪♪</i>

43
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:04,667
<i>♪♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪♪</i>

44
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,002
<i>♪♪ I am a mighty little man ♪♪</i>

45
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:11,215
<i>♪♪ I am a mighty little man. ♪♪</i>

46
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:21,600
What are you doing?

47
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:23,519
The sound from the refrigerator.

48
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,896
It's right between D
and D-sharp.

49
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,232
Ugh! It's making my skin crawl.

50
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:30,734
What if I hold a pillow
over your face

51
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:32,403
for, like, a really long time?

52
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,029
No, that's dangerous.

53
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,574
Do you know if we have earplugs?

54
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,617
If we did,
I'd be wearing them.

55
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:40,077
Go to sleep.

56
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,705
I can't.

57
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,957
Put your fingers in your ears.

58
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,751
And risk driving wax back
into my inner ear canal?

59
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:48,836
No, thank you.

60
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:54,091
Oh.

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

62
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,062
Good morning.

63
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:09,815
Are you trying to kill me?

64
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,359
No, I think
you're great.

65
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:14,445
Then why are you
in my bed?

66
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,654
I couldn't sleep.

67
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:18,490
Our refrigerator is
making a weird noise.

68
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:20,117
But so was one
of your nostrils,

69
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:21,785
so don't expect
me back tonight.

70
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,621
Go home before
I call the police.

71
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,664
You wouldn't call the
police on your Moonpie.

72
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,124
Then I'll call your mother.

73
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,960
That you would do.

74
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:32,713
And leave my extra key behind.

75
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,924
Aw.

76
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,967
Aw.

77
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:46,268
Do you know anything about
surviving psychological torture?

78
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:48,646
Because my family
escaped communist Vietnam,

79
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,915
we have to know about torture?

80
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:51,565
That was my thought.

81
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,525
Well, you're in luck.

82
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:54,902
What do you want to know?

83
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,738
I'm being tormented by a sound
coming from our refrigerator,

84
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,657
and I don't know how
to deal with it.

85
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,326
When my uncle was
in a reeducation camp,

86
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,870
he would imagine
disemboweling his torturers

87
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:06,789
with a bamboo spike.

88
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:10,834
Maybe I'll just get a book
on refrigerator repair instead.

89
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:11,919
Okay.

90
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,587
New subject.

91
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:16,131
Jessica Gieger
wears a black bra.

92
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:18,509
I saw it through the
sleeve of her shirt.

93
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:22,012
Not beige, not pink.

94
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,889
Black.

95
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:25,724
So mysterious.

96
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,274
What are you doing?

97
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:35,276
I'm going to take apart
the refrigerator

98
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,319
and figure out what's
making that noise.

99
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,406
That is a really good idea.

100
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,242
Usually you're not
supportive of my efforts.

101
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:44,743
I'm more mature now.

102
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:57,423
- Hi, Mom.
- What did you do?

103
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:00,634
Good news. I found out
what part was making that noise.

104
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:02,261
You have to put
this back together!

105
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,179
Now we're getting
to the bad news.

106
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:06,390
What made you think
you could fix this?

107
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,642
I'm smart...
and I had a book.

108
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:11,228
Do you <i>still</i> think
you're smart?

109
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:13,897
Yes.

110
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,443
I told him not to do it.
He wouldn't listen.

111
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,200
$200?!

112
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:27,453
It'll be okay.
We'll find the money.

113
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:28,996
Wait.

114
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,623
The old fridge in the garage.

115
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,335
- What's it...? What was...?
- What's that?

116
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:37,129
Well, I kind of donated
that fridge to the church.

117
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,841
You know, for the needy.

118
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,509
Are you kidding me?

119
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,681
I see tense moments like this
more than you think.

120
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,310
I'll just give you guys
some space.

121
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:57,775
You know how much it's gonna
cost to fix that fridge?

122
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,235
$200. I have
really good hearing.

123
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:04,907
Do you have any idea how hard
I work for the money we get?

124
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:06,867
I'm sorry.

125
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,579
I don't care how long it takes.

126
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,540
You're gonna pay me back
every cent of this.

127
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:15,042
Yes, sir.

128
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,379
I am very disappointed in you.

129
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,390
You know if you cry,
I can't enjoy your pain.

130
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:55,874
Mom,

131
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,168
since Sheldon cost you
all that money,

132
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,129
who's your new favorite...
me or Georgie?

133
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:01,964
You know I don't
have favorites.

134
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,424
Yeah, right.

135
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:07,261
Okay, whoever takes the trash
out first is my favorite.

136
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:08,971
She thinks we're stupid.

137
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,224
Dad, I'm pleased
to tell you

138
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,309
I've got a job to
pay back my debt.

139
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:15,811
Is that so?

140
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,521
I'm going to be a paperboy.

141
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:21,066
Well, that's great.

142
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,401
I'm proud of you.

143
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,278
How do you plan
on delivering these papers?

144
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:27,156
- Bicycle.
- You don't know how to ride a bicycle.

145
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,991
There's nothing I can't learn.

146
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:32,369
A week ago, I didn't know how
to take apart a refrigerator.

147
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,914
He can't deliver newspapers.

148
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,000
- Why not?
- It's too dangerous.

149
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,877
I think you're being
a little overprotective.

150
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,255
You expect him
to go riding around at 5:00 a.m.

151
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:46,091
with cars and dogs
and who knows what else?

152
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,218
I did it when I was his age.
So did Georgie.

153
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,891
You're gonna teach your brother
how to do this.

154
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,309
What if I don't want to?

155
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:56,560
You're doing it anyway.

156
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,896
Hey, nobody asked
your opinion.

157
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,482
I knew the answer.
I got excited.

158
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:12,284
Georgie?

159
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,994
Georgie?

160
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,245
What?

161
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,332
I'm ready to scrub the moral
stain off my character.

162
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,045
I hate everything about you.

163
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,471
When does the truck
bring the papers?

164
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,056
When it does.

165
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,016
That's a tautology.

166
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,018
- What?
- A tautology.

167
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,896
A statement that's true,
but uninformative.

168
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,232
Hey, you're supposed
to be the one teaching me.

169
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,608
That's funny.

170
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,278
Oh, there it is.

171
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,572
Over here! Over here!

172
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:52,074
This is exciting.

173
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,825
It's somethin'.

174
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,207
Thank you!
Have a great day!

175
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,583
Now what?

176
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:04,002
Take 'em into the
garage and fold 'em.

177
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:06,255
Oh, boy.

178
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,886
Fold 'em like this,
then rubber band.

179
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,723
But you didn't fold it
into even thirds.

180
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:19,142
- Nobody cares.
- I care.

181
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,144
Then do whatever you want.

182
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,316
Wake me up when you're done.

183
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,527
<i>Over the next 17 minutes,</i>

184
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,406
<i>I used physics, geometry
and old-fashioned hard work</i>

185
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,908
<i>to create the perfect
newspaper-folding system.</i>

186
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,078
I'm done.

187
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,373
Great. Let's
load up the wagon.

188
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,209
No, I'm done with this one;
I still have 39 more to go.

189
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,802
He's gonna be fine.

190
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,029
You don't have to tell me that.

191
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,263
I know he's gonna be fine.

192
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,973
If you believe that,

193
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,766
why aren't you in bed right now?

194
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,131
Because this is the same boy
who couldn't find his way out

195
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,812
of that sleeping bag.

196
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,148
He made his way out.

197
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:09,109
Just took him five
or ten minutes.

198
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,028
I know you're
worried, but...

199
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:14,698
he needs to experience
the world a little bit.

200
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:18,076
Why not let him do it
when most of it's asleep?

201
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,870
I suppose you're right.

202
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:26,084
You coming back to bed?

203
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:27,544
Are you crazy?

204
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,463
That's my little boy
out there in the dark.

205
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:33,133
Mm, but your big boy's
right here under the covers.

206
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:35,177
Ugh.

207
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,597
There is a nicer way
to say that.

208
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,934
All right, you got
your list of addresses?

209
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,895
- Right here.
- 'Kay. All you got to do

210
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,581
is go up to each house
and throw the newspaper

211
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:47,814
at their front door.

212
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:49,149
Got it.

213
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,609
All right,
I'm going back to bed.

214
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:51,693
Thank you, Georgie.

215
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:53,236
You've been a wonderful teacher,

216
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,447
and I'm very appreciative
that you took the ti...

217
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,741
Ah! My hands are black!

218
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,118
- Why are my hands black?
- Relax.

219
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:02,120
It's just the ink
from the papers.

220
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:03,830
Why wasn't I warned of this?!

221
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,668
Out, damned spot.

222
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,836

I'm here to collect

Right. Hang on.

Is there a problem?

290
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:15,564
No, it just doesn't seem
like very much.

291
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,566
You were late every day.

Well, I had to brave
the elements.

302
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,516
I'm sorry,
but I have a job to do.

303
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,060
How much longer
till you pay Dad back?

304
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:56,813
At this rate, six months.

Yes, Derek!

313
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:13,514

314
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,123
I also have a job

315
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,125

What's in the mug?

319
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:26,760
It's a coffee mug, Tam.

320
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,219
What do you think is in it?

321
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:29,429
Could be soup.

322
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:30,805
It's coffee.

323
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:31,890
Where'd you get it?

324
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,017

And before you ask,

325
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,603
no, I'm not the world's
greatest grandpa.

326
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,146
Since when do you drink coffee?

327
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,398
I don't,
but this job is killing me.

328
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:41,942
You wouldn't understand.

329
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,820
You realize I have a job.

330
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,739
At your parents'
convenience store?

331
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,115
That doesn't count.

332
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,575
Why not?

333
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:51,886
You get to sit
at a cash register

334
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,495
and have the fun of doing math.

335
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,747
Actually,
the cash register tells you

336
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,040
how much change to give.

337
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,293
Oh. That's too bad.

338
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:07,008
Oh, I hear they're opening
an Olive Garden

339
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,844
- where the old Sizzler used to be.
- On Hampton Road?

340
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,447
- Yeah.
- I don't think that was a Sizzler.

341
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,889
That was a Chi-Chi's.

342
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,557
No, the Chi-Chi's is on Bedford,

343
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,267
across from
the Payless Shoes.

344
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,645
She's right. Because,
one time, we got shoes

345
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,522
and then we got Chi-Chi's.

346
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:21,731
That was a good day.

347
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,733
Huh. I guess
that was a Sizzler.

348
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,610
I'm sorry they closed that.

349
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:27,487
Oh, there's still the
other one on Route 40.

350
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,822
Who cares?!

351
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,743
You have a problem?

352
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,027
Yes, I do.
I've had a long day.

353
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,538
Is it too much to ask
for a dinner

354
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,123
with a little peace and quiet?

355
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,791
Sheldon, you
do not talk

356
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,292
to your father like that.

357
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:44,629
Fine. I'd rather not speak
to any of you.

358
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,216
Maybe I better go talk to him.

359
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,592
- No, I got this.
- George,

360
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:50,969
maybe you should
calm down first.

361
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,679
I got this.

362
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:01,146
You want to
explain yourself?

363
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,605
I'd rather just go to bed,

364
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,941
since I have to be up
in a few hours anyway.

365
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,861
Look, I understand you're tired,
but that is no reason for you...

366
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,030
I'm not just tired.
I'm exhausted.

367
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:11,823
Everything hurts.

368
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:12,991
I get up in the morning

369
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,868
to do this job
I don't even like.

370
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,369
And I'm doing it
just for the money,

371
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,204
and it's not even
a lot of money.

372
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,874
I keep trying harder
and harder,

373
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,792
and it doesn't
even make a difference.

374
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,478
So if you're going
to yell at me or punish me,

375
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,713
let's just get it over with.

376
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,763
I'm not gonna punish you.

377
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,848
Why not? I deserve it.

378
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,603
Let me tell you about my day.

379
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:43,563
I got yelled at
by the principal

380
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,857
for benching a linebacker
who's flunking English.

381
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,610
Then I got yelled at even more
by the kid's parents.

382
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,488
Then I had to break up
a fight in the locker room.

383
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,323
Got elbowed in the neck.

384
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,657
That's a rough day.

385
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,493
That was all
before 10:00 a.m.

386
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,538
So I get what you're
going through.

387
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:03,833
But you'll notice, I didn't come
home and take it out on you.

388
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:07,629
No, you didn't.

389
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,506
I want you to get
back in there,

390
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,217
apologize to everyone,
and finish your dinner.

391
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:14,094
Yes, sir.

392
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,974
<i>My father's
wisdom touched me deeply.</i>

393
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,476
<i>Which is why, to this day,</i>

394
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,061
<i>no matter
what I'm going through,</i>

395
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,271
<i>I am never irritating
or abusive</i>

396
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:28,316
<i>to any of my friends
or loved ones.</i>

397
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,568
<i>Ask them. They'll tell you.</i>

398
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,701
<i>For the next several months,</i>

399
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,787
<i>I continued working
my paper route</i>

400
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,790
<i>until I paid my father back.</i>

401
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:49,337
<i>And by "working,"
I mean "delegating."</i>

402
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:56,177
I have no idea where I am.

403

1
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:08,138
Have been coveted by children
around the world.

2
00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:10,314
I was not one of those children.

3
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:12,099
What do you think?
I won it bowling.

4
00:00:12,142 --> 00:00:13,752
It was either that
or a Crock-Pot,

5
00:00:13,796 --> 00:00:15,276
and I already got
three of those,

6
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:17,539
so I thought I'd surprise you.

7
00:00:17,582 --> 00:00:20,281
No, thank you.
Video games are for children.

8
00:00:20,324 --> 00:00:23,197
Sheldon, you are a child.

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,590
I just blew the hot
off your SpaghettiOs.

10
00:00:25,634 --> 00:00:27,027
I'm sorry, Meemaw,

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,854
I just don't think
it's a very productive

12
00:00:28,898 --> 00:00:30,160
use of my time.

13
00:00:30,204 --> 00:00:33,033
You're a man of science.
Aren't you interested

14
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:37,080
in doing a little research here?

15
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:40,301
"Brave adventurer,
prepare to enter a world

16
00:00:40,344 --> 00:00:41,954
"beyond your imagination.

17
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:44,150
"Where the only sound you'll
hear is your own heart pounding

18
00:00:44,174 --> 00:00:46,220
as you race through
the dark woods."

19
00:00:46,263 --> 00:00:48,700
This sounds terrifying. Really?

20
00:00:48,744 --> 00:00:50,572
You don't even want to try it?

21
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:53,270
Honestly, I'd have more fun
with the Crock-Pot.

22
00:00:53,314 --> 00:00:57,535
Fine. I'll just play by myself.

23
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:00,016
That's amusing. Why?

24
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,106
I guess it's the juxtaposition
of an old person

25
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,978
using new technology;
It tickles me.

26
00:01:06,022 --> 00:01:09,460
What if this old person
really tickles you?

27
00:01:09,504 --> 00:01:11,114
I'll play! I'll play!

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

29
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:36,400
I'm not getting any younger.

30
00:01:36,444 --> 00:01:39,316
I have to read the
instructions first.

31
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,667
Did you know this document
gives us specific legal rights?

32
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:46,062
We may also have other rights
which vary from state to state?

33
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,585
I did not.

34
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:50,197
Well, now you do.

35
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,374
All right, I'm ready. Great!

36
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:55,593
To read the
manufacturer's warranty.

37
00:01:55,637 --> 00:01:58,727
You're killing me.

38
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,958
Hey, George, how y'all been?

39
00:02:13,002 --> 00:02:15,831
Good, good. Hey, fixed your
place up, looking snazzy.

40
00:02:15,874 --> 00:02:18,050
Thanks. Even got
a new water cooler.

41
00:02:18,094 --> 00:02:22,054
It's got those pointy cups,
look like Madonna's bra.

42
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:26,624
So, what's going on
with your truck,

43
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:30,889
other than the fact it's
got 130,000 miles on it?

44
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:33,544
She been running hot. I'm
worried I need a new radiator.

45
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:36,460
As your friend and neighbor,
I hope not,

46
00:02:36,504 --> 00:02:39,594
but as a businessman,
that'd be pretty sweet.

47
00:02:39,637 --> 00:02:42,074
It could just be the thermostat
not opening right.

48
00:02:42,118 --> 00:02:44,076
That is correct.

49
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,208
How'd you know that?

50
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:46,862
I took auto repair last year.

51
00:02:46,905 --> 00:02:48,385
And you actually paid attention?

52
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:50,996
I'm as surprised as you are.

53
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:55,784
Now we need to put in
a name before we start.

54
00:02:55,827 --> 00:02:57,873
What are you thinking?

55
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,397
We should combine the
letters in our two names,

56
00:03:00,441 --> 00:03:02,182
Sheldon and Meemaw.

57
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:04,967
Like, ShelMaw?

58
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,623
No, using all the
letters, like...

59
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,277
Emelda Showmen.

60
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,844
Did you just do that
in your head?

61
00:03:12,888 --> 00:03:14,194
Yes, why?

62
00:03:14,237 --> 00:03:17,197
Never mind, just put it down.

63
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:22,245
All right, here we go.

64
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:23,812
I thought I was playing.

65
00:03:23,855 --> 00:03:26,206
You don't know how to play;
You didn't read the manual.

66
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:29,165
You're in charge, Emelda.

67
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,210
Thank you.

68
00:03:31,907 --> 00:03:33,735
Should I go left or right?

69
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:36,999
Why don't you try going
in that cave?

70
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:39,610
Why would I do that?
It's probably dangerous.

71
00:03:39,654 --> 00:03:41,482
Sheldon, they wouldn't
have put the cave there

72
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:43,440
if they didn't
want you to go in it.

73
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:45,834
Seems unnecessarily
reckless, but okay.

74
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,665
Dark and dangerous.

75
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:51,840
I told you.

76
00:03:51,883 --> 00:03:53,885
Just keep going.

77
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:58,238
The box was right,
my heart is pounding.

78
00:03:58,281 --> 00:03:59,935
All right,

79
00:03:59,978 --> 00:04:02,111
good news.

80
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:03,112
Tell me.

81
00:04:03,155 --> 00:04:05,462
Well, the kid was right...

82
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:06,855
It's just the thermostat.

83
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,598
Yeah, yeah.
So how long to fix it?

84
00:04:10,641 --> 00:04:12,513
Nothing, 20 minutes. Can I help?

85
00:04:12,556 --> 00:04:15,733
Well, sure. Grab yourself a pair
of coveralls and have at it.

86
00:04:15,777 --> 00:04:17,082
Thanks.

87
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,389
Really?

88
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:21,304
I'm paying you
so my own son can fix my truck?

89
00:04:21,348 --> 00:04:23,306
Well, we could have
my son do it,

90
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,527
but we know how
that's gonna end.

91
00:04:28,442 --> 00:04:29,530
What are you doing?

92
00:04:29,573 --> 00:04:31,227
Kill him! I'm trying!

93
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,620
Well, what's the problem?

94
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:34,535
I seem to have weak thumbs.

95
00:04:34,578 --> 00:04:35,753
Pause it.

96
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:39,540
I'm a little winded.

97
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,759
Why don't you let the old person
give it a shot?

98
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:44,545
Would you like me to give
you a tutorial first?

99
00:04:44,588 --> 00:04:46,982
Give it to me.
I'll figure it out.

100
00:04:47,025 --> 00:04:49,506
We are such different
people, Meemaw.

101
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,682
Thank you.

102
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:59,386
Die, you sumbitches, die!

103
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:02,389
Very different people.
Die, you son bitches!

104
00:05:04,086 --> 00:05:07,307
When I grow up, will I be
a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader?

105
00:05:08,264 --> 00:05:10,919
"Not likely." Darn it.

106
00:05:10,962 --> 00:05:12,355
Did you tell her?

107
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,356
Why don't you tell her?

108
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,923
Tell me what?

109
00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:16,751
Herschel offered me
a part-time job.

110
00:05:16,794 --> 00:05:18,100
Really?

111
00:05:18,143 --> 00:05:19,580
Between that

112
00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:22,147
and football practice,
when would you do your homework?

113
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:23,410
When does he do it?

114
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:25,586
Are you okay with this?

115
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:27,414
Yeah, I think it'll
be good for him.

116
00:05:27,457 --> 00:05:31,069
I don't know, I think his
education should come first.

117
00:05:31,113 --> 00:05:33,028
Come on, Mom. It's not like
I'm gonna graduate

118
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:34,725
"val-dictator-torian."

119
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:36,945
You heard him.

120
00:05:36,988 --> 00:05:40,818
Fine, but I want you
here for dinner every night,

121
00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:43,125
and if your grades slip,
you are done.

122
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:45,301
Thank you. Now go wash up.

123
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,390
And don't get grease
all over my towels.

124
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:51,220
He really did know his stuff
at the shop. It was impressive.

125
00:05:51,263 --> 00:05:54,136
All right, well,
maybe it'll be a good thing.

126
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:58,445
How about a Houston
Oilers cheerleader?

127
00:05:58,488 --> 00:06:01,970
"Signs point to yes."
I'm gonna marry a quarterback.

128
00:06:09,717 --> 00:06:10,892
Over the next few days,

129
00:06:10,935 --> 00:06:12,459
I ran to my meemaw's house

130
00:06:12,502 --> 00:06:14,025
so we could save
the 8-bit princess.

131
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:15,568
And if it's unclear
how important this was,

132
00:06:15,592 --> 00:06:19,770
I ran.

133
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:22,382
Right behind you,
monster, monster!

134
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:23,513
I see him!

135
00:06:23,557 --> 00:06:25,559
You're losing life points,
do something!

136
00:06:25,602 --> 00:06:27,561
Calm down, I've got this.

137
00:06:27,604 --> 00:06:29,301
No, no, no, you're going to die!

138
00:06:29,345 --> 00:06:30,985
We're going to have
to restart this level!

139
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:34,437
Okay, we need to set
a few ground rules.

140
00:06:34,481 --> 00:06:35,438
Rules, love 'em.

141
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:37,397
Mazes, puzzles, panic attacks,

142
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,573
you're in charge.

143
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:42,880
Whooping monster butt,
that's my purview.

144
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:44,360
Understood. However...

145
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,231
Excuse me. Is there
a monster on that screen?

146
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:47,624
Yes, ma'am.

147
00:06:47,668 --> 00:06:51,802
And can two players swing
the magic sword? No.

148
00:06:51,846 --> 00:06:54,457
So what does that mean
as we go forward?

149
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:56,807
I have to shut my yap.

150
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:59,070
Attaboy.

151
00:06:59,114 --> 00:07:01,595
Can I still have a panic attack?

152
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:04,467
If you do it quietly.

153
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,953
No, no, no.

154
00:07:11,996 --> 00:07:15,696
So me and Herschel dropped
the engine on this Pacer today.

155
00:07:15,739 --> 00:07:17,567
It was so cool.

156
00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:20,309
I had a buddy in high school
had a Pacer

157
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:22,137
with the flames
painted on the side,

158
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,100
which was funny 'cause
the damn thing caught fire

159
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:26,141
during the Homecoming parade.

160
00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:27,464
Too bad he didn't know Herschel.

161
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,232
He can fix anything.
Guy's a genius.

162
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:33,148
You mean a car genius.

163
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:36,456
Is Dad getting his
feelings hurt? "Yes."

164
00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:39,676
The ball don't lie.

165
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,417
Sorry!

166
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,505
Excuse us.

167
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:46,509
Thank you.

168
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:48,424
See you later.

169
00:07:57,564 --> 00:07:58,956
There it is! The cyclops!

170
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,350
I see it! Get it, get it!

171
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:03,570
I'm trying! Use the sword!

172
00:08:03,613 --> 00:08:05,572
Use the sword! Your yap is open again.

173
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:08,270
Hello?

174
00:08:08,313 --> 00:08:10,272
What?

175
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:12,187
It's past his bedtime. Let's go.

176
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,190
Come on, five more minutes?

177
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:16,646
No. Now say good night
to your grandson.

178
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,281
You'll play with him
again tomorrow.

179
00:08:19,324 --> 00:08:21,370
Good night, Sheldon.

180
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:23,590
Good night, Meemaw.

181
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:27,419
Don't play without me.

182
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:28,725
Of course not.

183
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:32,207
How old are you?

184
00:08:33,774 --> 00:08:35,689
And I got my answer.

185
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,305
Hey, neighbor, what's up?

186
00:08:43,348 --> 00:08:44,611
Sorry to bother you so late,

187
00:08:44,654 --> 00:08:47,004
but one of my guys
called in sick tomorrow...

188
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:48,832
So we couldn't find
the key to the palace,

189
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:52,314
but then I figured out it was
in the hay behind the stables.

190
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:53,315
Great.

191
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:55,883
Hey, Herschel. Mary.

192
00:08:55,926 --> 00:08:57,972
I also found us extra life
points inside a demon.

193
00:08:58,015 --> 00:08:59,408
There are demons in this game?

194
00:08:59,451 --> 00:09:01,410
Don't worry, Meemaw
cut his head off.

195
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:04,500
Anyhoo, I was wondering

196
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,416
if Georgie could come by after
school tomorrow and help me out.

197
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:10,288
I don't know, Herschel,
he's got football practice.

198
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:12,421
What's going on?

199
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:14,442
Herschel's asking if you
want to work after school.

200
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:15,598
Great, I'll be there.

201
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:17,731
What about football? What about it?

202
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:19,012
I mostly sit
on the bench all day.

203
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:20,560
That's because
you got to earn your way

204
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:21,865
on to first string.

205
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:24,738
Or I can earn some money
working for Herschel.

206
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:27,218
Why don't you and I talk a bit
before you make a decision?

207
00:09:27,262 --> 00:09:30,091
Sorry, I-I didn't mean
to cause a problem.

208
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:31,634
I'll find somebody else.
Y'all have a good night.

209
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:33,355
Night, Herschel.Night.

210
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,619
Thanks a lot.

211
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:37,968
You really want to quit football

212
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:39,317
to go work in a garage?

213
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:40,318
Hell yeah.

214
00:09:40,362 --> 00:09:42,233
I thought you loved the game.

215
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:45,628
I do, but look at me.
I weigh 125 pounds.

216
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:47,804
That's not important. It's not?

217
00:09:47,848 --> 00:09:49,893
Every time I get tackled,
somebody's got to run over

218
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:52,374
with smelling salts
just to wake me back up.

219
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:55,377
Well, this isn't your decision.
You're gonna play football.

220
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,508
You can't make me.

221
00:09:56,552 --> 00:09:59,642
Yeah? Wait and see.

222
00:09:59,686 --> 00:10:01,601
Screw this.

223
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:10,435
Even while sleeping,

224
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:12,612
my quest to save
the princess continued,

225
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:15,310
which was quite a departure
from my usual dreams,

226
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:17,573
such as determining
the coolest prime number...

227
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,575
Which, by the way, is 73.

228
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,491
Kill it, Meemaw! Kill it!

229
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:25,407
What do you think I'm trying
to do? It won't die.

230
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,104
Maybe you need
a different weapon.

231
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:29,977
I already tried the
slingshot and the boomerang.

232
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,588
All I have left is
the damn flute.

233
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,546
It's a piccolo.
Didn't you pay attention

234
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,461
when the old lady gave it to us?

235
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:44,295
Hello? Meemaw.

236
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:47,690
I'm sorry for waking you, but
I know how to kill the cyclops.

237
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:49,561
We have to play the piccolo.

238
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:50,519
Ooh.

239
00:10:50,562 --> 00:10:53,043
What a great idea, moonpie.

240
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:54,218
We'll try it tomorrow.

241
00:10:54,262 --> 00:10:56,525
Excellent... Wait.

242
00:10:56,568 --> 00:10:59,049
How'd you answer your phone so
fast? It's not next to your bed.

243
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:04,489
Well, actually,
I was on my way to the bathroom.

244
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:07,362
You know us old people
and our bladders.

245
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:09,799
I'll call you right back.

246
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:17,154
That fibber.

247
00:11:17,198 --> 00:11:19,548
You're playing
the game right now.

248
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:20,636
I am not.

249
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,030
I saw you with my binoculars.

250
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:25,206
How about that.

251
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:27,121
You promised not to play
without me.

252
00:11:27,164 --> 00:11:29,166
We're a team.
Emelda Showmen, remember?

253
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:32,822
I'm turning off the game
and going to sleep right now.

254
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:35,042
You'd better.

255
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:37,348
I love you, good night.

256
00:11:39,394 --> 00:11:41,744
Binoculars for his birthday.

257
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:43,703
What was I thinking?

258
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:52,929
Where's Georgie?

259
00:11:52,973 --> 00:11:54,235
Don't worry about it.

260
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:55,627
I wasn't worried.

261
00:11:55,671 --> 00:11:58,326
I was practicing chitchat.

262
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:01,242
Your mother's taking him
to school.

263
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:04,201
That's not very efficient.
Our car's already going there.

264
00:12:04,245 --> 00:12:06,290
Not that it's any
of your business,

265
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:08,336
but I needed a break
from your brother.

266
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:11,208
I certainly understand that.
He's an acquired taste.

267
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:13,254
Like Grape-Nuts.

268
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:15,996
The first time I tried it,
I thought I was eating gravel.

269
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:19,129
But then I put a little sugar
on it and let it get soggy.

270
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:21,305
Now it's in my top six cereals.

271
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:23,960
I'll try soaking Georgie
in a bowl of milk.

272
00:12:24,004 --> 00:12:26,441
Sarcasm?

273
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:27,921
Yeah.

274
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:29,531
I had a feeling.

275
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:32,447
The clue was you don't normally
put people in bowls of milk.

276
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:03,391
I'm Sheldon Cooper's grandmother

277
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:05,393
and, I need to take him out
of school today.

278
00:13:05,436 --> 00:13:07,351
Sure. What's the reason?

279
00:13:07,395 --> 00:13:10,180
His Aunt Emelda's
not doing well,

280
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:12,400
and has asked to see him
'fore she goes.

281
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:13,880
I am so sorry.

282
00:13:13,923 --> 00:13:16,273
Does she want to see
his older brother also?

283
00:13:16,317 --> 00:13:17,927
Nah. She doesn't
like him as much.

284
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:22,410
Okay. I'll just
track down Sheldon, then.

285
00:13:26,283 --> 00:13:28,372
Boy, do I love a pop quiz.

286
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:32,550
Will Sheldon Cooper please
come to the main office?

287
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:38,818
"Ooh," what?

288
00:13:42,734 --> 00:13:44,345
This is hooky, Meemaw.

289
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:46,260
Hooky is a serious offense.

290
00:13:46,303 --> 00:13:48,436
You're messing with me, right?

291
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:50,239
Any other kid would be
thrilled their grandma

292
00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:52,396
took them out of school
to play a video game.

293
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,615
You've known me ten years.

294
00:13:53,658 --> 00:13:55,835
When have I ever
messed with you?

295
00:13:57,488 --> 00:14:01,492
I didn't see your kid
at practice today.

296
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:02,972
Everything all right?

297
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:05,714
Not really.

298
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:20,294
That's it? You're not gonna
ask me what's going on?

299
00:14:20,337 --> 00:14:23,253
I just did. You shut me out.

300
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:25,560
Well, it doesn't mean
you can't persist a little.

301
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:27,494
You know, this is the kind
of crap I get from my wife.

302
00:14:27,518 --> 00:14:29,216
I do not need it from you.

303
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:31,479
Sorry.

304
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:41,532
You're really not gonna ask?

305
00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:51,194
Boy.

306
00:14:53,805 --> 00:14:58,201
Well, moonpie, this is it.

307
00:14:58,245 --> 00:14:59,942
Our final dungeon.

308
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:02,684
Hard to believe.

309
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:05,643
Yeah.

310
00:15:05,687 --> 00:15:10,518
Would you like
to fight the last boss?

311
00:15:10,561 --> 00:15:12,259
You think I'm ready?

312
00:15:12,302 --> 00:15:14,261
We couldn't have gotten here
without you.

313
00:15:14,304 --> 00:15:16,195
Well, except for the part
you did when I was sleeping.

314
00:15:16,219 --> 00:15:18,918
We're having a moment here.
Don't ruin it.

315
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:25,315
I've fought many
digital battles in my life,

316
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:28,928
but none are as memorable as
this first one with my meemaw.

317
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:30,973
By handing me the controller,

318
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:33,584
she was telling me
she believed in me.

319
00:15:33,628 --> 00:15:38,502
That inside my small, fragile
frame beat the heart of a hero.

320
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:43,377
Behind you, behind you!
What're you doing?

321
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,118
Hit the A. Hit... I know, I'm pressing it.

322
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:46,521
Hit the A button. I'm pressing it.

323
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:48,295
Throw a bomb, throw the bomb! Which way?

324
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:49,557
Throw the bomb.

325
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,475
Hey. You up for some company?

326
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:57,434
Sure. Come on in.

327
00:15:57,478 --> 00:15:59,654
Sorry about the light beer,

328
00:15:59,697 --> 00:16:02,222
but Brenda's got me
on this health kick.

329
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:03,484
You are melting away.

330
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:06,226
Shut up. So, listen...

331
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:10,404
I feel bad about Georgie
and this whole football thing.

332
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:12,406
Thanks, but it's not on you.

333
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:15,931
I appreciate that,
but you got to know

334
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,715
there's an upside to this.

335
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,282
And that would be?

336
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:23,417
Your son has got a special gift.

337
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,201
A gift?

338
00:16:25,245 --> 00:16:26,811
We are talking
about Georgie, right?

339
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:29,814
Yeah. I mean, first off,
the kid really knows his way

340
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:32,817
around an engine,
which is all well and good.

341
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:36,212
But when it comes
to fixing tires,

342
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:40,216
I swear, I've never seen
anything like him.

343
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,262
Tires? How do you mean?

344
00:16:42,305 --> 00:16:45,352
George, I've been patching flats
for 25 years.

345
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:47,223
You know,
slap some soapy water on them,

346
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:48,746
look for the air bubble.

347
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,750
But your son,
he doesn't need any tricks.

348
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:56,276
He knows
where the puncture holes are.

349
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,581
He knows?

350
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,714
He knows.

351
00:16:59,757 --> 00:17:02,804
He's got a sixth sense
for tire damage.

352
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:04,216
I mean,
you got to see him in action.

353
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,634
I-It'll give you chills.

354
00:17:06,677 --> 00:17:07,698
You know, now that you say it,

355
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:09,071
whenever we had
a leaky football,

356
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:11,204
he knew exactly
where the hole was.

357
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:14,903
I am telling you, your boy's got
a future in the tire business.

358
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:18,733
Goodyear, Firestone, somebody's
gonna scoop him up first round.

359
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:20,735
Thanks, Herschel.

360
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:22,345
That does my heart good.

361
00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:25,044
So I guess you got two geniuses
in the family.

362
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:26,523
Guess I do.

363
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:29,657
Who knows,
maybe Missy'll make it three.

364
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,529
Or it's two.

365
00:17:43,714 --> 00:17:47,544
I won. I saved the princess.

366
00:17:47,588 --> 00:17:49,633
I knew you could do it!

367
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:52,636
Yes! We saved her!

368
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,464
We saved the princess!
We did it!

369
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:56,466
We did it.Yep.

370
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:04,126
So now what?

371
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,347
We just return
to our ordinary lives?

372
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:10,698
I guess so.

373
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:17,966
Or... we could just go to
the store and buy another game.

374
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:24,364
Since that night,
I've battled orcs, zombies,

375
00:18:24,407 --> 00:18:27,758
Nazis, Nazi-zombies,
a dinosaur in a go-kart,

376
00:18:27,802 --> 00:18:29,717
and played Van Halen's
"Hot for Teacher"

377
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,501
on a stringless, plastic guitar.

378
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:33,721
But nothing would ever compare

379
00:18:33,764 --> 00:18:36,898
to that first quest
with my meemaw.

380
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:38,900
Although Leonard pulling
a groin muscle

381
00:18:38,943 --> 00:18:41,337
doingDance Dance Revolution
was a close second.

382
00:18:59,877 --> 00:19:03,403
Talk to me.
Tell me where it hurts.

383
00:19:04,882 --> 00:19:06,319
Gotcha.

384
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:13,282
I got goose bumps.

385

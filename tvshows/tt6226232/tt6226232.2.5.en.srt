Did you kill it?

Ooh, yummy.

Mmm. Mmm. [CHUCKLES]

31
00:01:11,053 --> 00:01:12,586
So, what's up?

00:01:12,588 --> 00:01:14,864
You comin' to me to ask for

No.

But if that were to come to pass,

00:01:19,164 --> 00:01:21,995
are you authorized to bless the union?

He was joking.

Oh.

00:01:28,218 --> 00:01:30,240
- Tell him.
- Okay.

39
00:01:30,243 --> 00:01:32,043
So, some colleagues of mine

40
00:01:32,046 --> 00:01:35,747
at the university are doing
a research study on twins.

41
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,309
I told them about
Sheldon and his sister,

42
00:01:38,312 --> 00:01:40,356
and they were most intrigued.

43
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,867
Uh, what kind of study?

44
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,916
It's a longitudinal investigation

45
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:46,186
of environmental and genetic factors

46
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:49,559
in the development of
cognitive and other capacities

47
00:01:49,562 --> 00:01:52,392
in pairs of fraternal
and identical twins.

48
00:01:53,362 --> 00:01:54,962
You asked.

49
00:01:54,964 --> 00:01:58,165
[CHUCKLES]: Well, geez,
I don't... I don't know

50
00:01:58,167 --> 00:02:00,767
if I want some scientists
pokin' and proddin' the kids.

51
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:02,357
Oh, but they wouldn't
be poked and prodded.

52
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:05,005
They just have to, you
know, answer some questions.

53
00:02:05,007 --> 00:02:08,012
And maybe some puzzles and tests.

54
00:02:08,015 --> 00:02:10,309
That's not too bad. Where is it?

55
00:02:10,312 --> 00:02:12,403
Houston. Oh, it just got bad.

56
00:02:12,406 --> 00:02:14,590
That's... that's a long drive.

57
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:18,418
It does pay $50 an hour
plus gas and expenses.

00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:19,886
Really?

59
00:02:19,888 --> 00:02:22,137
I told you to start with that.

60
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,924
Oh.

61
00:02:25,494 --> 00:02:28,129
No. See, Mary, that's the best part...

62
00:02:28,132 --> 00:02:30,364
There's no pokin' and proddin'. Plus,

63
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:33,020
you know how much Sheldon
loves puzzles and tests.

64
00:02:33,023 --> 00:02:34,401
I'm not sure.

65
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:36,370
[SIGHS] Think about the money.

66
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:39,106
50 bucks an hour, four
or five hours a week.

67
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:40,641
That-That's more than our mortgage.

68
00:02:40,643 --> 00:02:42,376
I know, I know.

69
00:02:42,378 --> 00:02:44,228
But Sheldon's already self-conscious

70
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:45,864
about being different from other kids.

71
00:02:45,867 --> 00:02:47,661
I worry how this might affect him.

72
00:02:47,664 --> 00:02:49,817
You're being too
protective. He's a rock.

A <i>rock?</i>

74
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:53,168
Are we raising the same child?

75
00:02:53,171 --> 00:02:54,721
And what about Missy?

76
00:02:54,723 --> 00:02:56,738
Aren't these tests
gonna make her feel bad

77
00:02:56,741 --> 00:02:58,307
that she's not as smart as Sheldon?

78
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,114
[SNORTS] I'm not as smart as Sheldon.

79
00:03:00,117 --> 00:03:01,380
Doesn't make me feel bad.

80
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:04,964
And we could put the money aside
for their college education.

81
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:07,007
That's a good point.

82
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,376
It's a great point.

83
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:10,403
I don't have to tell
you, times are changing.

84
00:03:10,406 --> 00:03:11,638
Kids are pitching in.

85
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,887
Like that Webster kid on TV...

86
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,372
He's making buckets of
money for his parents.

87
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,345
Well...

88
00:03:18,347 --> 00:03:20,436
I suppose we could give it a try.

89
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:22,372
There you go. I'll call Sturgis,

90
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,094
tell him we're in.

Baby, I'm getting a fishing boat.

92
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:33,340
So, Sheldon, Missy, we
got some exciting news.

93
00:03:33,343 --> 00:03:35,495
- Georgie took a bath?
- No.

94
00:03:35,497 --> 00:03:37,504
And how come I don't get exciting news?

95
00:03:37,507 --> 00:03:38,932
This isn't about you.

96
00:03:38,934 --> 00:03:41,335
But after dinner, why
don't you go rinse off?

97
00:03:41,337 --> 00:03:42,843
So, what's up?

98
00:03:42,846 --> 00:03:44,905
Well, a couple of scientists at the college

99
00:03:44,907 --> 00:03:46,528
where Dr. Sturgis teaches are doing

100
00:03:46,531 --> 00:03:48,682
a research study on twins.

101
00:03:48,685 --> 00:03:50,840
They want to meet you guys,
ask you some questions.

102
00:03:50,843 --> 00:03:52,679
Oh, boy, a research study.

103
00:03:52,681 --> 00:03:54,090
Will they give us written tests?

104
00:03:54,093 --> 00:03:56,676
- Yeah, I think so.
- Oh, boy.

105
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:59,918
Now, you don't have to do
this if you don't want to.

106
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:01,254
It's purely volunteer.

107
00:04:01,257 --> 00:04:02,590
I don't want to do it.

108
00:04:02,593 --> 00:04:04,995
- Why not?
- They probably just want to find out

109
00:04:04,998 --> 00:04:07,731
why you're so smart
and I'm just average.

110
00:04:07,734 --> 00:04:10,430
[QUIETLY]: Average?
That's a little generous.

111
00:04:10,432 --> 00:04:11,932
Why don't they want to test me?

112
00:04:11,934 --> 00:04:14,267
- Georgie, not now.
- 'Cause I'm available.

113
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:16,582
Listen, why don't we just
go there this Saturday

114
00:04:16,585 --> 00:04:17,692
and give it a try?

115
00:04:17,695 --> 00:04:20,098
And if you don't like it,
we don't have to do it again.

116
00:04:20,101 --> 00:04:21,942
Or they'll love it,
and they'll do it till

117
00:04:21,944 --> 00:04:23,710
they're 18, 19 years old.

118
00:04:23,712 --> 00:04:25,416
I already love it.

119
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:27,719
My man. Missy?

120
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:31,158
I believe there might be

121
00:04:31,161 --> 00:04:32,906
a Dairy Queen on the way there.

122
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:35,989
Can I get an Oreo Blizzard?

123
00:04:35,991 --> 00:04:37,257
You know what I think?

124
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,257
I think you're smarter than him.

125
00:04:42,536 --> 00:04:44,903
Dr. Thorpe and Dr. Pilson,

126
00:04:44,906 --> 00:04:47,122
here are your research volunteers,

00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,505
Sheldon and Missy.

128
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:49,739
So nice to meet you.

129
00:04:49,742 --> 00:04:51,976
Thank you for
participating in our study.

130
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:54,792
Always happy to help advance
our understanding of me.

131
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,528
I'm just in it for the Dairy Queen.

132
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:58,211
All right.

133
00:04:58,213 --> 00:04:59,980
Um, if you two wouldn't
mind waiting here,

134
00:04:59,982 --> 00:05:02,840
we'd like to start by talking
to your mom, dad, and grandma.

135
00:05:02,843 --> 00:05:04,523
Why?

136
00:05:04,526 --> 00:05:06,497
Jut to get some background information

137
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,587
on the both of you.

138
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:11,110
Smart. Ask how old I was when
I completed potty training.

139
00:05:11,113 --> 00:05:12,379
You won't believe it.

140
00:05:12,382 --> 00:05:14,594
I'll do that.

141
00:05:14,596 --> 00:05:16,582
Will you keep an eye on 'em?

142
00:05:16,585 --> 00:05:19,606
Well, I'll try, but
if they start running,

143
00:05:19,609 --> 00:05:20,893
you may never see them again.

144
00:05:20,896 --> 00:05:21,895
[LAUGHS]

145
00:05:21,898 --> 00:05:23,303
Shall we?

146
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:27,497
We are on the clock, right?

147
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,042
- George.
- Hmm?

148
00:05:36,004 --> 00:05:38,972
[CHUCKLES] Boy, this brings
back some memories.

149
00:05:38,974 --> 00:05:41,558
- How come?
- Well, when I was your age,

150
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:43,977
I was also taken to a university

151
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,178
to be studied.

152
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,514
Because they thought
you were really smart?

153
00:05:47,516 --> 00:05:50,984
Because they thought I
was clinically insane.

154
00:05:50,986 --> 00:05:52,751
And it wasn't just me.

155
00:05:52,754 --> 00:05:54,785
Did you know that when Albert Einstein

156
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,923
was a little boy, his parents worried

157
00:05:56,925 --> 00:05:59,025
there was something wrong with him?

158
00:05:59,027 --> 00:06:00,893
Because he couldn't comb his hair?

159
00:06:00,896 --> 00:06:03,963
No, that was a choice
he made later in life.

160
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:05,665
When he was young,

161
00:06:05,667 --> 00:06:08,468
he wanted nothing to
do with other children,

162
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,238
and would often have

about their body language?

327
00:13:10,855 --> 00:13:12,021
No.

328
00:13:12,023 --> 00:13:14,123
I think they found his kryptonite.

329
00:13:17,342 --> 00:13:18,661
THORPE: Missy,

330
00:13:18,663 --> 00:13:20,795
what do you think is
happening in this picture?

331
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:22,965
The girl monkey on the couch

332
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:24,500
is telling the guy monkey a secret.

333
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:27,270
Must be something juicy,
'cause he's smiling.

334
00:13:27,272 --> 00:13:28,604
Anything else?

335
00:13:28,606 --> 00:13:29,842
It might be dirty,

336
00:13:29,845 --> 00:13:31,340
'cause this girl monkey is sending

337
00:13:31,342 --> 00:13:32,875
the kid monkey out of the room.

338
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:35,445
He doesn't want to go. He looks sad.

339
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:36,546
Is that all?

340
00:13:36,548 --> 00:13:38,597
The monkeys on the
couch are drinking tea,

341
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,016
so it's a tea party.

342
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,566
Okay, very good. Let's
look at another picture.

343
00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:46,689
I'm not done. The monkey in the painting

344
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:47,990
is wearing an old lady hat,

345
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:49,992
so she's probably a meemaw monkey.

346
00:13:49,994 --> 00:13:51,897
She's not at the party,

347
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,897
so she must be bowling or dead.

348
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:59,001
Well, Missy won that round.

349
00:13:59,003 --> 00:14:01,612
It's actually not a contest, George.

350
00:14:01,615 --> 00:14:03,623
This is Texas. Everything's a contest.

351
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:06,008
A woman in a doorway.

352
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,510
Anything else?

353
00:14:07,512 --> 00:14:09,679
She's holding her head with her hand.

354
00:14:09,681 --> 00:14:11,581
And what do you think that means?

355
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,216
Um...

356
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:16,085
Wouldn't you rather ask me
about trains going to St. Louis?

357
00:14:16,087 --> 00:14:19,322
Good gravy, she's sad, Sheldon, come on.

358
00:14:19,324 --> 00:14:21,657
Oh, she's very upset.

359
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:23,726
I don't know why.

360
00:14:23,728 --> 00:14:25,545
Oh! Maybe she wasn't invited

361
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:27,530
to the tea party at the monkey house.

362
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:29,198
[CHUCKLES]

363
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,467
Also, she's wearing
a belt, like you are.

364
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:33,269
Nice going. Very cute.

00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:37,840
And I'm loving the hair.

[WHISPERS]: Yeah.

368

A lion sitting in a
chair, holding a pipe.

369
00:14:42,475 --> 00:14:43,769
Good.

370
00:14:43,772 --> 00:14:45,615
But what do you think is on his mind?

371
00:14:45,617 --> 00:14:47,583
How should I know? Maybe he's wondering

372
00:14:47,585 --> 00:14:49,385
why he's posing for a silly picture

373
00:14:49,387 --> 00:14:50,987
instead of eating a gazelle.

374
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,755
PILSON: Anything else?

375
00:14:52,757 --> 00:14:55,792
What exactly are we doing here?

376
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,293
I thought the purpose of this study

377
00:14:57,295 --> 00:14:59,262
was to find out how smart I am.

378
00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:00,811
PILSON: That's what we're doing,

379
00:15:00,814 --> 00:15:03,222
but there are different
kinds of intelligence.

380
00:15:03,225 --> 00:15:04,867
Poppycock!

381
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,442
There's only one kind of intelligence...

382
00:15:06,444 --> 00:15:07,804
George, Sheldon's getting upset.

383
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:09,038
I don't like it.

384
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,800
All right, I'll just
change it back to Missy.

385
00:15:12,043 --> 00:15:14,477
You are an insightful young lady.

386
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:16,753
I don't know what that
means, but thank you.

387
00:15:16,756 --> 00:15:18,648
It means perceptive.

388
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,917
You see things most people miss.

389
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:23,286
My name is Missy... go figure.

390
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:25,488
Have you always been that way?

391
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,324
I guess so. I think when
you're on your own a lot,

392
00:15:28,326 --> 00:15:30,393
you get good at seeing
that kind of stuff.

393

- THORPE: Really?
- MISSY: My dad

does football with my older brother,

395
00:15:34,365 --> 00:15:37,333
so they're like a team.

396
00:15:37,335 --> 00:15:40,803
And my mom and meemaw spend all
their time fussing over Sheldon,

397
00:15:40,805 --> 00:15:42,638
so they're like a team, too.

398
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,066
So no one's on your team?

399
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,309
Nope.

400
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:47,844
It's just me.

Oh, Lord.

Hey, what's up with
you and Dr. Pillsbury?

I don't know what you're talking about.

Oh.

A little late for me to start cooking.

The five of us? That's kind of pricey.

Why don't I get to pick?

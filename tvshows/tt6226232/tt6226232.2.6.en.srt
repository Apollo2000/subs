1
00:00:02,483 --> 00:00:05,150
With us tonight is Pastor Jeff Difford

2
00:00:05,153 --> 00:00:07,715
from the First Baptist
Church of Medford.

3
00:00:07,718 --> 00:00:09,656
Thank you for being here, Pastor.

4
00:00:09,658 --> 00:00:11,957
- My pleasure.
- So it would appear

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,059
that your church's

6
00:00:13,061 --> 00:00:15,418
Halloween Hell House has stirred up

7
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:17,700
quite a bit of controversy this year.

8
00:00:17,703 --> 00:00:19,299
I wouldn't call it

9
00:00:19,301 --> 00:00:20,492
controversy.

10
00:00:20,495 --> 00:00:21,734
What would you call it?

11
00:00:21,736 --> 00:00:22,855
A-As you know,

12
00:00:22,858 --> 00:00:24,325
the purpose of a Hell House

13
00:00:24,328 --> 00:00:26,723
is to demonstrate the wages of sin,

14
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:29,075
so as to lead people back to God.

15
00:00:29,077 --> 00:00:30,450
That's wonderful.

16
00:00:30,453 --> 00:00:33,262
But doesn't it concern you that a lot

17
00:00:33,265 --> 00:00:35,098
of parents were alarmed

18
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:37,650
at the gruesome scenes you portrayed?

19
00:00:37,652 --> 00:00:41,921
Once again, our intentions were pure.

20
00:00:41,923 --> 00:00:44,638
Why don't we take a look
at just how pure they were.

21
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:45,707
Let's roll the clip.

22
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,093
Boy.

23
00:00:47,095 --> 00:00:48,428
I need another beer.

24
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,997
Darling, don't you
think you've had enough?

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,433
I'll tell you when I had enough!

26
00:00:53,436 --> 00:00:56,031
Whoa! Hey, cowboy,

27
00:00:56,186 --> 00:00:58,353
why don't you put that
down and call it a night.

28
00:00:58,356 --> 00:00:59,622
Don't you tell me what to do.

29
00:01:05,213 --> 00:01:07,080
That's enough, Peg.

30
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:11,551
Dear Lord.

31
00:01:11,553 --> 00:01:13,553
As you can see, our last
attempt at a Hell House

32
00:01:13,555 --> 00:01:16,189
may have been a tad... traumatizing.

33
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:17,700
I thought it was a hoot.

34
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:20,226
Some of the little
ones peed their pants.

35
00:01:20,228 --> 00:01:21,694
But that wasn't the goal.

36
00:01:21,696 --> 00:01:24,030
A nine-year-old crapped himself.

37
00:01:24,032 --> 00:01:26,132
Why are you showing me this?

38
00:01:26,134 --> 00:01:28,134
Well, Mary, this year, we'd like to go

39
00:01:28,136 --> 00:01:30,347
with a more family-friendly production.

40
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,145
And I thought you'd be the
perfect person to head that up.

41
00:01:33,148 --> 00:01:35,875
Really? Me?

42
00:01:35,877 --> 00:01:37,844
Yes, you. Absolutely.

43
00:01:37,846 --> 00:01:40,301
Gosh, I don't know.

44
00:01:40,304 --> 00:01:43,653
I always felt I had a
flair for the creative arts,

45
00:01:43,656 --> 00:01:45,718
but putting on a big show like that...

46
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,090
You'll have a sizable budget
and all the help you'll need

47
00:01:48,093 --> 00:01:50,090
constructing sets, building props,

48
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:52,156
special effects, makeup.

49
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,358
Does sound tempting.

50
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:54,560
But, most importantly,

51
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:57,567
you'll have an opportunity
to bring people to God

52
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,661
by vividly demonstrating
the perils of sin.

53
00:02:00,664 --> 00:02:02,903
Be careful if you touch on adultery.

54
00:02:02,906 --> 00:02:05,500
Last year, one of the
actors got pregnant.

55
00:02:05,503 --> 00:02:06,739
Thanks, Peg.

56
00:02:06,741 --> 00:02:08,608
So, what do you say?

57
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,710
I already know the first
change I'm gonna make.

58
00:02:10,712 --> 00:02:12,178
Instead of calling it "Hell House,"

59
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,812
which is a little off-putting,

60
00:02:13,815 --> 00:02:15,048
I'm gonna call it...

61
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,883
"Heck House."

62
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:17,981
Isn't that great?

63
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,052
That is great.

64
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,575
You don't really mean that.

65
00:02:20,578 --> 00:02:22,188
Yes, I do.

66
00:02:23,072 --> 00:02:24,289
I get it.

67
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:25,725
Happy wife, happy life.

68
00:02:25,727 --> 00:02:27,343
You need to stop talking.

69
00:02:27,346 --> 00:02:28,989
So it's not gonna be scary?

70
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,698
It will, but without
all the blood and gore.

71
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,566
But I like blood and gore.

72
00:02:33,568 --> 00:02:35,568
Hang on, y'all are
trying to scare people

73
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,936
into joining the church?

74
00:02:36,938 --> 00:02:38,538
Yeah. But people like

75
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,106
getting scared on Halloween anyway.

76
00:02:40,108 --> 00:02:42,679
Why not make 'em jump
in the right direction?

77
00:02:42,682 --> 00:02:44,692
Actually, fear has
been a recruiting tactic

78
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:45,945
used by organized religion

79
00:02:45,947 --> 00:02:47,179
for centuries.

80
00:02:47,182 --> 00:02:49,137
When you add guilt to
keep people in line,

81
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,751
it's an extremely efficient
form of crowd control.

82
00:02:51,753 --> 00:02:55,588
Our religion is based on
love, Sheldon, not fear.

83
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,824
So what happens when people
don't follow the rules?

84
00:02:57,826 --> 00:02:59,025
They burn in hell.

85
00:03:01,496 --> 00:03:03,830
Because God loves 'em.

86
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,074

89
00:03:35,497 --> 00:03:37,163
Hi, Georgie.

90
00:03:37,165 --> 00:03:39,140
Why was Veronica Duncan hugging you?

91
00:03:39,143 --> 00:03:41,334
I'm tutoring her in trigonometry.

92
00:03:41,336 --> 00:03:43,169
And that gets you hugs?

93
00:03:43,171 --> 00:03:45,512
Thanks to me, she got her first C-minus.

94
00:03:45,515 --> 00:03:47,807
Just between us, she's a little slow.

95
00:03:47,809 --> 00:03:49,375
That's not what I heard.

96
00:03:49,377 --> 00:03:50,559
What did you hear?

97
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:52,012
Is she secretly clever?

98
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:54,447
Because if she is, I
completely missed it.

99
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:55,448
It doesn't matter.

100
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,016
You just need to introduce me to her.

101
00:03:57,018 --> 00:03:58,184
Why?

102
00:03:58,186 --> 00:04:00,039
I want to be her friend.

103
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:01,390
Well, you better take a number.

104
00:04:01,393 --> 00:04:03,356
She's friends with a
lot of boys around here.

105
00:04:03,358 --> 00:04:06,114
Let me worry about that. You
just need to introduce us.

106
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:07,437
All right.

107
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,528
You know, she pays me
two dollars for every one

108
00:04:09,531 --> 00:04:10,730
of our tutoring lessons.

109
00:04:10,732 --> 00:04:12,809
How much did it cost
her to get a C-minus?

110
00:04:12,812 --> 00:04:14,145
$26.

111
00:04:14,148 --> 00:04:15,668
That's a good deal.

112
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,870
Now, remember, next
week, we start our work

113
00:04:17,872 --> 00:04:19,405
on Streetcar Named Desire.

114
00:04:19,407 --> 00:04:21,407
So please prepare a monologue

115
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:23,434
for either Blanche or Stanley.

116
00:04:23,437 --> 00:04:26,379
Usually, the girls do Blanche
and the boys do Stanley,

117
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:29,382
but no judgment...
You follow your heart.

118
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:33,942
Thank you again

119
00:04:33,945 --> 00:04:35,973
for letting me come
by to pick your brain.

120
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,765
Please. Anything for the church.

121
00:04:37,768 --> 00:04:39,492
Are you a religious man?

122
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:41,301
I'm an actor.

123
00:04:41,304 --> 00:04:43,726
I'm whatever you need me to be.

124
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:44,864
All right.

125
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:46,799
As I told you on the phone,

126
00:04:46,801 --> 00:04:48,278
I have been tasked

127
00:04:48,281 --> 00:04:50,982
with mounting this year's
Halloween production.

128
00:04:50,985 --> 00:04:53,114
Is that a haunted
house kind of deal?

129
00:04:53,117 --> 00:04:55,848
Yes, but with the goal
of bringing people to God.

130
00:04:55,851 --> 00:04:57,910
I do know something about that.

131
00:04:57,912 --> 00:05:01,247
When I played Puck in Midsummer,

132
00:05:01,249 --> 00:05:04,984
the Tulsa Herald called
my performance heavenly.

133
00:05:04,986 --> 00:05:06,817
Wow! Good for you.

134
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,955
Thank you, thank you.

135
00:05:08,957 --> 00:05:11,895
Okay. Um, I was hoping

136
00:05:11,898 --> 00:05:14,622
to put on a little play
in each of the rooms

137
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,164
that portrays one of
the seven deadly sins.

138
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,899
Pride, envy, gluttony,
lust, sloth, wrath and greed!

139
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:21,901
Wow, you know your sins!

140
00:05:21,903 --> 00:05:24,070
Well, again, I'm an actor.

141
00:05:24,072 --> 00:05:27,540
They are the tools in my box.

142
00:05:27,542 --> 00:05:30,690
Um, have you considered

143
00:05:30,693 --> 00:05:32,692
a narrator, you know, um,

144
00:05:32,695 --> 00:05:34,547
like, a tour guide kind of thing?

145
00:05:34,549 --> 00:05:36,418
That's interesting.

146
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:37,917
But who would that be?

147
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,919
Well, I'd have to think
the big man himself.

148
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:42,555
- God?
- Satan.

149
00:05:42,558 --> 00:05:45,184
That's spooky.

150
00:05:45,187 --> 00:05:48,294
And he's trying to
lure people toward sin.

151
00:05:48,296 --> 00:05:49,462
Exactly.

152
00:05:49,464 --> 00:05:51,228
That's a pretty big role.

153
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,622
I wonder who could do it.

154
00:05:53,935 --> 00:05:55,735
Well, it would have to be someone

155
00:05:55,737 --> 00:06:00,403
with enough range to
convey sincerity and charm,

156
00:06:00,406 --> 00:06:04,850
all the while, hiding
a dark and corrupt soul!

157
00:06:04,853 --> 00:06:06,945
Good golly.

158
00:06:06,948 --> 00:06:10,483
If you were just a little
taller, you'd be perfect.

159
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:11,851
I have lifts.

160
00:06:15,256 --> 00:06:16,856
What are we doing here?

161
00:06:16,858 --> 00:06:18,585
Waiting for Veronica.

162
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:19,959
How do you know she's in there?

163
00:06:19,961 --> 00:06:21,562
It's kind of her homeroom.

164
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:24,130
Hello again.

165
00:06:26,734 --> 00:06:27,934
Hey. What's up?

166
00:06:27,936 --> 00:06:31,343
This is my brother Georgie.
He wanted to meet you.

167
00:06:32,073 --> 00:06:34,240
- Really?
- Really.

168
00:06:35,343 --> 00:06:36,609
I like your hair.

169
00:06:36,611 --> 00:06:38,778
Me, too.

170
00:06:45,687 --> 00:06:47,019
What do you think?

171
00:06:47,021 --> 00:06:48,554
Pretty great?

172
00:06:48,556 --> 00:06:50,823
Realtor's letting us use it for free.

173
00:06:50,825 --> 00:06:53,025
Wow. How'd you swing that?

174
00:06:53,027 --> 00:06:54,093
Well, I promised

175
00:06:54,095 --> 00:06:55,394
Fred Murphy a lead role

176
00:06:55,396 --> 00:06:56,450
in the lust room.

177
00:06:56,453 --> 00:06:58,484
Ooh.

178
00:06:58,487 --> 00:07:00,700
Look at you, just wheeling and dealing

179
00:07:00,702 --> 00:07:03,433
like a big-time Hollywood producer.

180
00:07:03,436 --> 00:07:05,770
Maybe you're in the wrong business.

181
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:06,934
Being a mother?

182
00:07:06,937 --> 00:07:08,641
Being a Christian.

183
00:07:08,643 --> 00:07:09,750
Greetings!

184
00:07:09,753 --> 00:07:12,177
Good! Mr. Lundy, you made it.

185
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,380
We're gonna be working
together. You can call me Gene.

186
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:17,016
- All right, Gene, this is my mother, Connie.
- Hi.

187
00:07:17,018 --> 00:07:18,084
Hello.

188
00:07:18,086 --> 00:07:20,219
Now, I would've bet
she was your big sister.

189
00:07:20,221 --> 00:07:22,822
I thought you said he was a good actor.

190
00:07:22,824 --> 00:07:24,156
Now.

191
00:07:24,158 --> 00:07:25,758
So, what do you think?

192
00:07:28,594 --> 00:07:30,680
- Spiderwebs.
- What?

193
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:32,583
We're gonna need some
spiderwebs and I think

194
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,399
maybe some fire effects on the left

195
00:07:34,402 --> 00:07:36,146
and right side of the portal.

196
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:37,083
Portal?

197
00:07:37,086 --> 00:07:38,571
Portal to hell.

198
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:40,406
Sure, sure.

199
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:43,009
Now, the script calls for me to appear

200
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:45,364
from beneath the house
in a cloud of smoke.

201
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:47,580
But I think that's gonna be ambitious.

202
00:07:47,582 --> 00:07:49,148
Script? What script?

203
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,050
I wrote a script.
Don't worry about it.

204
00:07:51,052 --> 00:07:53,219
I was gonna write the script.

205
00:07:53,221 --> 00:07:55,087
Well, now you don't have to.

206
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:02,061
Do you believe this?

207
00:08:02,063 --> 00:08:03,489
Believe it, love it,

208
00:08:03,492 --> 00:08:05,531
glad I didn't wait in the car.

209
00:08:13,674 --> 00:08:15,670
I can't believe this.

210
00:08:15,673 --> 00:08:16,923
No good?

211
00:08:16,926 --> 00:08:18,107
It's awful.

212
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,423
It makes sin seem like a good thing.

213
00:08:20,426 --> 00:08:21,852
Well, that's the problem, isn't it?

214
00:08:21,855 --> 00:08:23,521
I mean, if sin didn't
seem like a good thing,

215
00:08:23,523 --> 00:08:24,579
nobody would do it.

216
00:08:24,582 --> 00:08:26,735
George, please, I'm in no mood.

217
00:08:26,738 --> 00:08:28,226
Hey. Wrath.

218
00:08:28,228 --> 00:08:30,025
That's one of the seven sins, right?

219
00:08:30,028 --> 00:08:31,728
Pastor Jeff gave me this project

220
00:08:31,731 --> 00:08:33,598
because he knew I'd be best at it.

221
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,696
Now Gene... Lundy is taking over.

222
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:38,873
Look, pride. And envy.

223
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:41,139
Don't stop. Four sins to go.

224
00:08:43,777 --> 00:08:46,444
I'm guessing lust
ain't happening tonight.

225
00:08:52,126 --> 00:08:53,908
You see a large red button.

226
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:55,044
What do you do?

227
00:08:55,956 --> 00:08:57,622
I press it.

228
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:02,893
The floor opens up and you
plunge into a 60-foot pit.

229
00:09:02,896 --> 00:09:04,725
I fly out.

230
00:09:04,728 --> 00:09:06,831
Up, up, and away!

231
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,567
Again, you're not Superman in this game;

232
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:11,626
You're Superman for Halloween.

233
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:13,438
Which isn't till next week.

234
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,839
So I'm in a pit.

235
00:09:14,841 --> 00:09:16,174
You're in a pit.

236
00:09:16,176 --> 00:09:20,183
Then I blast my way out
with my super breath!

237
00:09:21,814 --> 00:09:23,448
Just let him do it.

238
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,849
Dinner's ready.

239
00:09:24,851 --> 00:09:26,618
- Five more minutes.
- Hey, Georgie.

240
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,853
I saw you talking to Veronica Duncan.

241
00:09:28,855 --> 00:09:30,355
Yeah. So?

242
00:09:30,357 --> 00:09:31,556
How well do you know her?

243
00:09:31,558 --> 00:09:33,458
Not as well as I'm gonna.

244
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,728
I introduced them.

245
00:09:34,731 --> 00:09:36,361
He math skills are dreadful.

246
00:09:36,363 --> 00:09:38,420
Did you know Superman has a dog?

247
00:09:38,423 --> 00:09:39,898
His name is Krypto.

248
00:09:40,577 --> 00:09:42,923
He plays fetch in space.

249
00:09:45,272 --> 00:09:49,541
Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut. Cut.

250
00:09:49,543 --> 00:09:51,442
It's supposed to be wrath.

251
00:09:56,785 --> 00:09:58,711
Give him a little kick
now that's he's down.

252
00:09:58,714 --> 00:10:00,084
Give him a little kick.

253
00:10:01,421 --> 00:10:03,588
That's right, that's good.

254
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,201
Yes. Yeah.

255
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,291
No, go for it.

256
00:10:06,293 --> 00:10:07,759
Yes.

257
00:10:17,904 --> 00:10:21,005
Kind of stomp down on
him, stomp down on him.

258
00:10:21,007 --> 00:10:23,675
Yes. That's the way. Good.

259
00:10:23,677 --> 00:10:25,110
Now, Fred, remember,

260
00:10:25,113 --> 00:10:29,314
you are the personification of lust.

261
00:10:29,316 --> 00:10:33,818
Your sole reason for
being is to try to satisfy

262
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,089
this unquenchable thirst
for physical pleasure.

263
00:10:38,091 --> 00:10:41,926
Great. Will there be
kissing and touching?

264
00:10:41,928 --> 00:10:44,568
You bet.

265
00:10:44,571 --> 00:10:46,165
Now what?

266
00:10:46,168 --> 00:10:48,985
Pretend kissing. Pretend touching.

267
00:10:50,303 --> 00:10:53,438
Fred, would you just give me a moment?

268
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,939
Mary, I-I've tried to be patient,

269
00:10:56,942 --> 00:10:58,475
but if I'm gonna do this,

270
00:10:58,478 --> 00:11:00,778
put my reputation on the line,

271
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,481
I'm gonna need you to
back off just a little bit.

272
00:11:03,483 --> 00:11:06,517
Do I need to remind you that
the purpose of Heck House

273
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,820
is to show how sins destroy our lives?

274
00:11:08,822 --> 00:11:10,021
Yeah, so?

275
00:11:10,023 --> 00:11:12,690
You are making them into a good thing.

276
00:11:12,692 --> 00:11:14,696
Have you read the script?

277
00:11:15,528 --> 00:11:17,160
He's gonna get syphilis.

278
00:11:17,163 --> 00:11:18,796
He goes home, he gives it to his wife.

279
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:20,157
She goes crazy.

280
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,533
She kills him and her entire family.

281
00:11:22,535 --> 00:11:24,032
What am I missing?

282
00:11:24,035 --> 00:11:25,576
Sorry I'm late.

283
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:27,171
I couldn't find my keys,

284
00:11:27,173 --> 00:11:29,107
and then my car wouldn't start.

285
00:11:29,109 --> 00:11:30,475
Then I got lost.

286
00:11:30,477 --> 00:11:32,043
Holy smokes.

287
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:34,509
Hi. Are you my make out partner?

288
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:38,764
No. No. No one's making out.

289
00:11:38,767 --> 00:11:40,657
This all stops right now.

290
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,369
You have got to calm down.

291
00:11:42,372 --> 00:11:44,888
I will not have innocent
children walk through this house

292
00:11:44,891 --> 00:11:47,058
on Halloween and see a half-naked woman.

293
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,761
A half-naked woman
chock-full of syphilis.

294
00:11:49,763 --> 00:11:53,531
- What?
- It's pretend syphilis.

295
00:11:53,533 --> 00:11:57,335
Mary, I am a trained
theater professional.

296
00:11:57,337 --> 00:12:02,573
Why don't you just let me
do what I do, while you,

297
00:12:02,575 --> 00:12:07,111
you know, go home and
make a nice tuna casserole.

298
00:12:08,848 --> 00:12:10,199
All right, Fred...

299
00:12:10,202 --> 00:12:11,973
I know what you're thinking

300
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:13,888
She's going to tear his throat out.

301
00:12:13,891 --> 00:12:16,043
But what in fact happened is she did

302
00:12:16,046 --> 00:12:17,855
what she thought Jesus would do.

303
00:12:17,858 --> 00:12:20,524
She went home and made
that tuna casserole.

304
00:12:20,527 --> 00:12:21,726
It was a little salty

305
00:12:21,728 --> 00:12:24,090
but I ate it because she was in a mood.

306
00:12:24,935 --> 00:12:27,069
Trick or treat!

307
00:12:41,443 --> 00:12:45,378
Greetings. Pleased to meet you.

308
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:49,245
Satan, Lucifer,

309
00:12:49,248 --> 00:12:52,518
Mephistopheles, Beelzebub.

310
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,287
Of course, when I make
a dinner reservation,

311
00:12:54,289 --> 00:12:56,856
I-I go by "Eric."

312
00:12:56,858 --> 00:12:58,865
It's easier to spell.

313
00:12:58,868 --> 00:13:00,634
Before we begin

314
00:13:00,637 --> 00:13:03,296
tonight's descent into Heck,

315
00:13:03,298 --> 00:13:06,199
I'd like to tell you
a little about myself.

316
00:13:06,201 --> 00:13:09,302
'Cause it's all about you, isn't it?

317
00:13:09,304 --> 00:13:12,038
I was God's chosen angel.

318
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,240
I was his favorite.

319
00:13:14,242 --> 00:13:16,409
We used to go camping together.

320
00:13:16,411 --> 00:13:20,126
But then, because I wanted
to have a little bit of fun,

321
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:22,815
I was cast from heaven.

322
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:25,509
Tonight, you will bear
witness to that fun.

323
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:30,890
You will decide whether it is sinful...

324
00:13:30,892 --> 00:13:32,859
or just another Saturday night.

325
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:37,263
Come with me... if you dare.

326
00:13:39,801 --> 00:13:41,401
Just watch your step right over here,

327
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,403
'cause there's some electrical wires.

328
00:13:45,262 --> 00:13:47,079
Trick or treat.

329
00:13:47,082 --> 00:13:49,829
Look how cute y'all are.

330
00:13:49,832 --> 00:13:53,051
Now, I know you are Superman.

331
00:13:53,054 --> 00:13:54,447
What about the rest of you?

332
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:57,116
- I'm Cyndi Lauper.
- I'm a wizard.

333
00:13:58,253 --> 00:14:00,053
And I'm Carl Sagan.

334
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:01,888
Who?

335
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,456
Carl Sagan.

336
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,458
He's the host of Cosmos.

337
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,094
Well, isn't that something.

338
00:14:08,096 --> 00:14:10,063
Now, y'all be safe and have a fun night.

339
00:14:10,065 --> 00:14:11,331
I'm Super...

340
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:19,138
You like Guns N' Roses?

341
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,485
They're all right.

342
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:22,613
Yeah, they're all right.

343
00:14:30,018 --> 00:14:31,484
You as smart as your brother?

344
00:14:31,486 --> 00:14:33,453
Nobody is.

345
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,822
I got an older sister
that's kind of a genius.

346
00:14:35,824 --> 00:14:37,323
Yeah?

347
00:14:37,325 --> 00:14:38,618
Why didn't she tutor you?

348
00:14:38,621 --> 00:14:40,393
She's in jail.

349
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:43,129
What'd she do?

350
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:44,697
She sold a piñata full of weed

351
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:46,299
to an undercover cop.

352
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:48,845
Doesn't sound like much of a genius.

353
00:14:48,848 --> 00:14:52,238
I don't know, she
graduated high school.

354
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,040
Ooh, peanut butter cups!

355
00:14:54,042 --> 00:14:56,843
Superman loves peanut butter cups!

356
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,547
So you see, the sin of greed.

357
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:04,717
Very wealthy man, a beautiful house,

358
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:07,220
swimming pool, several German cars,

359
00:15:07,222 --> 00:15:10,556
and a young wife who worshipped him.

360
00:15:10,558 --> 00:15:12,225
Excuse me, Mr. Satan.

361
00:15:12,227 --> 00:15:14,727
What?

362
00:15:14,729 --> 00:15:15,832
You kind of left out

363
00:15:15,835 --> 00:15:17,597
how greed is the root of all evil,

364
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:19,065
and how it corrupts the soul.

365
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:21,234
It's in there. It's called subtext.

366
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:24,579
Why don't we take a gander
at the eternal torment

367
00:15:24,582 --> 00:15:25,938
that is sloth.

368
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:30,543
I can't believe no
one in this town knows

369
00:15:30,545 --> 00:15:32,078
who Carl Sagan is.

370
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,813
Why even have a TV?

371
00:15:33,815 --> 00:15:37,016
Stupid Mrs. Gifford gave me a banana.

372
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:38,951
Where's Billy?

373
00:15:38,953 --> 00:15:40,386
He had to go to the bathroom.

374
00:15:40,388 --> 00:15:42,255
- So he went home?
- No.

375
00:15:42,257 --> 00:15:44,223
He's right behind that tree.

376
00:15:44,225 --> 00:15:46,269
Wait up, guys.

377
00:15:46,272 --> 00:15:49,028
I got a little on my cape.

378
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,644
Ew.

379
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:00,673
There's nobody at my house.
You want to come over?

380
00:16:00,676 --> 00:16:01,774
Yes.

381
00:16:01,776 --> 00:16:03,443
Okay, let's go.

382
00:16:12,887 --> 00:16:14,220
Look at this.

383
00:16:14,222 --> 00:16:17,490
We threw a party for
heaven and nobody came.

384
00:16:17,492 --> 00:16:20,793
Not one person chose to be saved.

385
00:16:20,795 --> 00:16:22,782
Well, did you tell
'em about the cupcakes?

386
00:16:22,785 --> 00:16:23,763
Where I think you went wrong

387
00:16:23,765 --> 00:16:25,298
is in your timing.

388
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,634
If you'd done this deal
during a war or a plague,

389
00:16:28,636 --> 00:16:30,636
then you'd have a boatload of converts.

390
00:16:30,638 --> 00:16:32,454
Famine. Famine would bring 'em in.

391
00:16:32,457 --> 00:16:34,207
What do you know about famine?

392
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:37,258
Hola, amigos.

393
00:16:38,223 --> 00:16:39,545
Hey, Pastor Jeff.

394
00:16:39,547 --> 00:16:42,009
Why so glum? This is going great.

395
00:16:42,012 --> 00:16:44,317
Donations are through the roof.

396
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,986
Nobody wants to be saved.

397
00:16:46,988 --> 00:16:50,923
Yeah, but donations
are through the roof.

398
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:53,392
Is that all this means
to you, raising money?

399
00:16:53,394 --> 00:16:56,095
Hey, that money is
gonna do a lot of good

400
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,396
for a lot of people.

401
00:16:57,398 --> 00:16:59,198
Now, quit being such a fun sponge.

402
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,558
Here, have some grapes.

403
00:17:07,504 --> 00:17:09,304
What's that?

404
00:17:09,307 --> 00:17:10,907
Some stupid haunted house

405
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,979
my mother's doing for the church.

406
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:14,981
Let's check it out.

407
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:17,617
But I-I thought we were
going to your house.

408
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,019
We are, let's just do this first.

409
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:21,420
It'll be fun.

410
00:17:27,662 --> 00:17:29,102
Pleased to meet you.

411
00:17:29,105 --> 00:17:32,164
Satan...

412
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,700
My mother's fears that
no one would be saved

413
00:17:34,702 --> 00:17:37,238
that Halloween night
were proven incorrect.

414
00:17:37,241 --> 00:17:39,907
As they kissed, she
thought about the choices

415
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,807
that led her to this moment.

416
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:45,177
Mr. Lundy's scene about
lust made a deep impact

417
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:48,114
- on my brother's date.
- Her youth was gone.

418
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:50,043
She had traded her beauty for a few

419
00:17:50,046 --> 00:17:54,820
tawdry dollars, and now she
had nothing left but shame...

420
00:17:56,691 --> 00:17:58,758
and venereal disease.

421
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:07,183
She asked to be saved by Jesus.

422
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,686
I don't want to live like this anymore.

423
00:18:10,972 --> 00:18:13,188
Just repeat after me...

424
00:18:13,191 --> 00:18:15,048
And as it turns out, she was.

425
00:18:15,051 --> 00:18:17,743
She went on to live
a life devoted to God,

426
00:18:17,746 --> 00:18:20,282
feeding the poor,
even helping her sister

427
00:18:20,285 --> 00:18:23,115
start a literacy program
for female prisoners.

428
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:27,438
My brother, on the other
hand, became a devout atheist

429
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,422
after that night.

430
00:18:29,424 --> 00:18:30,832
We got one!

431
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,209
Trick or treat.

432
00:18:34,212 --> 00:18:36,159
Aren't y'all precious.

433
00:18:36,162 --> 00:18:39,371
And you look like a little Carl Sagan.

434
00:18:39,374 --> 00:18:44,889
Vindication, the sweetest candy of all.

435

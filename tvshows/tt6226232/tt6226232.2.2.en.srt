00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,879
<i>Previously on</i> Young Sheldon...

2
00:00:03,963 --> 00:00:06,090
I've been corresponding
with Dr. John Sturgis

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:07,508
<i>at East Texas Tech.</i>

4
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:09,260
<i>He said I could audit
his course.</i>

5
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:10,553
I'm John Sturgis.

6
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:12,471
Sheldon invited me to dinner.

7
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:15,349
Spaghetti and hot dogs
is delightful.

8
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:16,642
You're only here temporarily?

9
00:00:16,726 --> 00:00:18,060
That's the plan for now,

10
00:00:18,144 --> 00:00:22,273
but I could be enticed to stay.

11
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,796
I do believe there
was subtext there.

12
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:24,859
Did you pick up on it?

13
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,697
Okay. I'll see you later.

14
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,500
Are you sure
you don't want to stay with me?

15
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,677
I don't think so. I don't really
understand this stuff.

16
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,995
That's how I felt
when we watched <i>Dirty Dancing,</i>

17
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:37,121
and I stayed.

18
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,849
When Patrick Swayze
takes his shirt off in here,

19
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:40,833
I'll be back.
You have a good one.

20
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,426
Hello.

21
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:51,509
Hi.

22
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:53,971
Who are you?

23
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:55,181
I'm Paige.

24
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:56,974
I like your bow tie.

25
00:00:57,058 --> 00:00:58,392
Thank you.

26
00:00:58,476 --> 00:00:59,852
You seem awfully young,
Paige.

27
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,229
Are you with an adult
who's taking this class?

28
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:04,690
No. Dr. Sturgis heard
about my research

29
00:01:04,774 --> 00:01:07,026
on quantum chromodynamics
at high temperatures

30
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:09,236
and invited me
to audit his course.

31
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,488
Is that so?

32
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,948
Yes. He's been super nice.

33
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:15,451
Interesting. Well,
just so we're clear,

34
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,912
he's my mentor,
he's my meemaw's boyfriend,

35
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,748
and he had spaghetti
and hot dogs at my house.

36
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:24,085
The spaghetti
goes on the hot dogs?

37
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:25,169
No.

38
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,254
You realize
this is a very advanced class.

39
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:28,254
We'll be discussing

40
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,549
deriving nuclear physics
from the quark model.

41
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:32,986
Do you know if he'll be doing
a full color octet calculation

42
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,096
with matrix manipulations?

43
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:37,264
I do not.

44
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:39,725
Do you know how to differentiate
under the integral sign?

45
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:41,685
No.

46
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:44,146
Well, do you know anything?

47
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:47,024
I know you're in my spot.

00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,008
I'm ten.

55
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:14,552
I'm ten, too.

56
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,053

February 26th.

00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:20,266
March 17th.

59
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:22,518
I'm the youngest person
in this class.

60
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,436
That's funny.

61
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,150
Oh, good.

62
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:30,651
I see you two have met.

63
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,111
I'm younger than him.

64
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:35,156
How come you never mentioned
she was coming to this class?

65
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,324
I thought it would be
a fun surprise.

66
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:38,784
I don't like surprises.

67
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:40,202
Neither do I.

68
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:41,745
Then why did you do it?

69
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,706
Some people like surprises.

70
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,249
I love surprises.

71
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,750
Did you enjoy this one?

72
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,753
- Yes.
- A 50 percent success rate.

73
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:52,590
Not bad. Let's get started.

74
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,677

00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,773
Awful quiet back there.

79
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:14,445
I'm having an emotion
I'm unfamiliar with.

80
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,864
Hmm. Think it might
have something to do

81
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,407
with your new classmate?

82
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,658
It's possible.

83
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:22,912
She's the only variable
in the social equation.

84
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,663
So what are you feeling?

85
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:26,624
My face is hot,

86
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,167
I have a knot in my stomach,

87
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,794
and I'm resisting the urge
to kick your seat right now.

88
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,963
I'm thinking it
might be jealousy.

89
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,673
No, that's not in my nature.

90
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:37,551
All right, let's go through
all the emotions.

91
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:38,928
I'm looking at your face,

92
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:41,555
so I'm gonna rule out happy.

93
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,806
Are you sad?

94
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,642
No, there's too much anger
in there.

95
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,018
Oh, well, maybe you're angry.

96
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,853
No, there's too much sad
in there.

97
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:49,480
Maybe you got a little crush
on her.

98
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,273
Do you want me
to kick your seat?

99
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,359
I don't know, Moonpie.

100
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:55,778
I'm still thinking
it might be jealousy.

101
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,572
Give me one reason
why I would be jealous.

102
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:01,742
Well, Dr. Sturgis
means a lot to you,

103
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,744
and now he's paying
attention to somebody else.

104
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,913
You're used to being
the only smart kid around,

105
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,123
and now there's another.

106
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:09,583
Oh, and there's
the possibility...

107
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:11,210
I said one reason, thank you.

Sheldon's professor
and your mother's lover.

Hi. And "John"
was more than enough.

114
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,646
I was calling because there's
a new student in my class

115
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,064
who's Sheldon's age.

No kidding.

117
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:37,403
Her mother wondered if I could

<i>since you have so much

Don't you understand
what this means?

131
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,688
Rather than me feel dumb,
how about you just tell me?

132
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:16,233
These are parents
we can actually relate to.

133
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:18,944
- Yeah, sure.
- All the times we wonder

134
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:21,572
if we're doing right by Sheldon
or how to handle him,

135
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,615
we finally have someone
to compare notes with.

136
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:24,950
There's notes?

137
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:26,452
I've just been winging it.

138
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,662
- I'm gonna call her right now.
- Sounds good.

139
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,957
Oh, thank you, Lord,
for connecting us

140
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,293
with the parents
of another special child.

141
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:40,382
You kids are special, too.

142
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:43,469
Do you feel special?

143
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,304
At least
I'm the only daughter.

144
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:46,847
You got nothing.

145
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,640
And she's such a know-it-all.

146
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,017
Yeah, you mentioned that.

147
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,643
I'm surprised her
arm wasn't sore

148
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,062
from raising her hand so much.

149
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:54,396
Yep, sure.

150
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,106
And who goes to college
with stickers

151
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,691

152
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:58,859
I don't know.

Unicorn stickers.

00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,866
Guess who's coming
over tomorrow?

157
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,369
Your new friend Paige.

Okay, I'm gonna go.

159
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:19,755
Come on, Shelly. Maybe
you'll end up being friends.

160
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:20,964
I don't like her,

161
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,609
I'm not going to like her,
and Tam is my friend.

162
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:23,926
I don't need another one.

163
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,928
You can have more
than one friend.

164
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,055
I'm sure Tam
has other friends.

165
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,932
No, I'm all he's got.

166
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,434
And even I avoid him
half the time.

167
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:34,144
Also, you don't have
any friends.

168
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,771
Why are you so worried about me?

169
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,357
I have friends.

170
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,984
Then how come the only person
who ever comes over is Meemaw?

171
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,277
Because...

172
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,071
Okay, this isn't about me.

173
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:47,199
So Paige didn't make a
good first impression,

174
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,492
but that can change.

175
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,703
What's that new <i>Star Trek</i> show?

176
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,664
<i>Next Generation?</i>

177
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,708
When that first came on,
you said a new <i>Star Trek</i>

178
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,669
without Dr. Spock
could never be good,

179
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,963
but I've seen you watching it.

180
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:03,340
Well, first of all,
it's Mr. Spock.

181
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:05,634
Dr. Spock writes books
about babies.

182
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,219
My apologies.

183
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,555
And second of all,
Paige isn't a TV show.

184
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,683
She's a person, and we all know
how I feel about people.

185
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,190
Okay, look.

186
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:21,984
You're right.

187
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:27,865
I don't have many friends,

188
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:31,743
so I was hoping
to get to know Paige's mom.

189
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,624
But if it makes you
uncomfortable,

190
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,335
then I will call her
and cancel.

191
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:46,800
I'll think about it.

192
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,970
Thank you, baby.

193
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,264
<i>Guilt and jealousy
in the same day.</i>

194
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,600
<i>I slept hard that night.</i>

195
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,228
Mmm.

196
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:02,065
Did you know that there's a type
of vanilla flavoring

197
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,359
derived from the anal glands

198
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:06,236
of the North American beaver?

199
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,238
That seems like a fact
you could have shared

200
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:09,698
before we started eating.

201
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,617
It isn't used very often.

202
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,579
I understand it's difficult
to, uh, milk the little sacs.

203
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,457
Cool. Okay, new topic.

204
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,292
Let's talk about Sheldon.

205
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,002
Wonderful. What about him?

206
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:25,881
He's having kind of a hard time
with the new girl in your class.

207
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:27,758
Really? Why?

208
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,552
He's jealous of the attention
you're paying her.

209
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,096
Well, she's remarkable.

210
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,140
You see that? Less of that.

211
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,184
But I think
he's remarkable, too.

212
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,027
Perfect. More of that,
less of the other one.

213
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,896
Understood.

214
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,649
See, this is why
we're great together.

215
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,193
You teach me
about social etiquette,

216
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,737
and I teach you
about beaver anuses.

217
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,739
It is magical.

218
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:54,743
Did you know "ani"
is also acceptable

219
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,411
as the plural of "anus"?

220
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:58,830
And the magic continues.

221
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,800
<i>Must have been most
difficult for you to share.</i>

222
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,505
<i>The thought
of spending an afternoon</i>

223
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,549
<i>with Paige seemed excruciating,</i>

224
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:10,676
<i>but I wanted
to make my mother happy.</i>

225
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,302
<i>I was torn.</i>

226
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,179
<i>The release of emotions,
Mr. Spock,</i>

227
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,890
<i>is what keeps us healthy...</i>

228
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,767
<i>emotionally healthy, that is.</i>

229
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,812
<i>Luckily, the wise
words of Gene Roddenberry,</i>

230
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,814
<i>flatly delivered
by Leonard Nimoy,</i>

231
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,440
<i>resolved my dilemma.</i>

232
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:27,401
<i>That may be, Doctor.</i>

233
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,028
<i>However, I have noted</i>

234
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:33,782
<i>that the healthy release
of emotion</i>

235
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,326
<i>is frequently very unhealthy.</i>

236
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,955
<i>I realized if Mr. Spock
could rise above his emotions</i>

237
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,416
<i>while the fate of the</i>
Enterprise <i>hung in the balance,</i>

238
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:46,336
<i>certainly I could tolerate
Paige for a few hours.</i>

239
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,963
I'm not watching this crap.

240
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,715
<i>Why do I listen to you?</i>

241
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,135
<i>Tony, this is going
to help you choose a major.</i>

242
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,470
<i>This test is designed
to help you focus.</i>

243
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,474
<i>I know, but what if it
says all I'm good at is...</i>

244
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,515
What are you doing?

245
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,517
Suppressing my emotions.

246
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,561
Oh, yeah? Suppress this.

247
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,774
Hot dogs.

248
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:15,032
<i>Vulcans use
a technique called</i> Kolinahr

249
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,366
<i>to suppress their emotions.</i>

250
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,951
Sheldon,
they're here!

251
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,745
<i>Obviously, I wasn't a Vulcan.</i>

252
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,413
<i>So I did the next best thing:</i>

253
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,957
<i>Took my feelings
and shoved them down so far</i>

254
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,626
<i>they may have been lost
forever.</i>

255
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,669
Hi, Sheldon!

256
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,713
<i>The release of emotions,
Mr. Spock,</i>

257
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,715
<i>is what keeps us healthy.</i>

258
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:34,468
<i>Dr. McCoy was an idiot.</i>

259
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,641
Well, you just have
a beautiful home.

260
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:43,310
- Thank you.
- Can I interest anyone

261
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,811
in something stronger
than iced tea?

262
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,772
Oh, well, I'll take a beer
if you have one.

263
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,607
Don't worry.
He's personally keeping

264
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,109
the Lone Star Brewing Company
in business.

265
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,654
They did send me a belt buckle.

266
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,656
Be right back.

267
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,867
So, Barry, uh,
Linda tells me

268
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,535
- you're a dentist?
- Uh, yes.

269
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:01,912
I have a practice up
in Jasper.

270
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,956
Uh, Paige actually does some
of the bookkeeping for us.

271
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,208
That's so funny.

272
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,709
Sheldon does our taxes.

273
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:09,795
- Oh!
- Yeah, we used to pay her

274
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,088
in stickers,
but this year,

275
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,651
she actually started
asking for money.

276
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,034
Well, don't let Sheldon
hear that.

277
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,342
We pay him in binder clips.

278
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,511
He loves being organized.

279
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:18,595
Boy, does he.

280
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,698
We can't go to the grocery store
without him making sure

281
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,724
that all the labels
are facing the right way.

282
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:26,186
Oh, the stock boys there
are always so happy to see him.

283
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,689
- That's adorable.
- Well,

284
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,774
it wasn't adorable
when we redid our shower

285
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,735
and he wouldn't use it 'cause
two of the tiles were crooked.

286
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,070
He took baths
in the sink

287
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,405
until we got it fixed.

288
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:41,368
So does Paige do
any quirky stuff like that?

289
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,788
- No.
- Not really.

290
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,707
Oh.

291
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,252
Now, since we'll be spending
a few hours together,

292
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,713
I've created a list of
activities to keep us occupied.

293
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,156
We'll start with
a tour of my room,

294
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,174
then board games,
and if time permits,

295
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:58,510
you can look at
and not touch my trains.

296
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,262
Oh, My Little Pony.

297
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,222
I love My Little Pony.

298
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,474
That's my sister's,
and it's not part of the tour.

299
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,309
I share a room
with my sister, too.

300
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,811
It's super fun.

301
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:08,895
You're wrong.

302
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,065
Now, over here, we have my desk.

303
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:14,860
This is my computer.
That's my mouse.

304
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,779
This is my printer. This is the
paper that goes in the printer.

305
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,531
This is a box of extra paper

306
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,324
that also goes
in the printer.

307
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:27,038
And this is my signed picture
of Professor Proton.

308
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:28,623
Do you watch his show?

309
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:30,667
No. I don't
really like it.

310
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,461
You don't?

311
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:33,670
I think he's boring.

312
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,215
And he dumbs everything down.

313
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:40,510
<i>Come on,</i>
Kolinahr, <i>don't fail me now.</i>

314
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,929
And next on the tour,
we have...

315
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,639
a lamp.

316
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,604
This is not
making me feel better.

317
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:51,855
Their kid is perfect.

318
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,231
And so is ours.

319
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:55,734
So we're lying to
each other. Fine.

320
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,028
It's just nice to get to know
another family

321
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,447
who's in a similar situation
as us.

322
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,574
And we're still lying.

323
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,038
What grade
are you in?

324
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,790
Eighth.

325
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:11,541
You?

326
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,918
Tenth.

327
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,002
Cool.

328
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,088
Nobody asked, but fourth.

329
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,301
Why do grownups do this?

330
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,386
They love to stick random kids
together

331
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,263
and expect them
to just be friends.

332
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,474
I know. I hate that.

333
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:28,725
Fresh Prince is right.

334
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,435
Parents just don't understand.

335
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,270
I love that song.

336
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:33,522
I have a
cassette of it,

337
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,857
but I recorded it off the radio.

338
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:37,335
You can hear Sheldon
in the background

339
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:40,320
saying stuff
about Sir Isaac Neutron.

340
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:43,323
Ugh, my sister's
always talking about him.

341
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,158
I don't know why.

342
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:46,576
I think he's dead.

343
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,912
You have no idea
how much it sucks

344
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,455
to have a brother
like him.

345
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,541
Believe it or not,
he's in my class.

346
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,669
My parents sent Paige
to a private school.

347
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:58,338
Cool. We're too
poor for that.

348
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,596
Does Sheldon
make you feel stupid?

349
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,640
Nah, I'm smart in other ways.

350
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,225
Me, too.

351
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,935
Hey, I saw an old TV
in the alley.

352
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,270
Want to go throw rocks at it?

353
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,311
- Cool!
- Hell yeah!

354
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:15,564
Let's do it.

355
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,025
We could play traditional chess.

356
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,069
Or if you're interested,
we could play a variant

357
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,612
with a new piece I invented.

358
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,197
That sounds fun.

359
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:25,866
What's the new piece?

360
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,033
A wizard.

361
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:28,952
The wizard cannot be taken,
and at any point,

362
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:32,455
he can teleport and switch
places with any other piece.

363
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,708
Yes, but there's
an obvious flaw.

364
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,711
- What flaw?
- Well, any time anyone is checkmated,

365
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,147
they can simply have the wizard
and their king switch places.

366
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,257
So the game will never end.

367
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:45,218
I knew that.
You passed my test.

368
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,221
We told Paige
that if she won

369
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:49,949
the regional spelling bee,
she could get a puppy.

370
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,308
We ended up with two,

371
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,351
'cause she won twice.

372
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:55,270
Fun! That... that's fun.

373
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,815
All right,
that's enough about Paige.

374
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:02,110
So, George, I know you're
a football coach.

375
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,403
What about you, Mary?

376
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,447
I work part-time at the church.

377
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,073
- Oh.
- Oh, that's so nice.

378
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,467
I used to work at the
practice with Barry,

379
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,243
but I had to quit
once Paige's schedule

380
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:11,453
- started to get busy.
- Mm.

381
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:12,996
Well, that's understandable.

382
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,999
A unique child
can require a lot of attention.

383
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,169
Mm. Try all
the attention. Hmm?

384
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,922
- Okay. You know that's not true, Barry.
- Well...

385
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,423
She's...

386
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,841
she's right. It's not.

387
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,676
Although I did spend
Father's Day alone

388
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,803
'cause she took Paige
to a robotics show.

389
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,889
Okay. That's
enough, Barry.

390
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,474
They don't need
to hear all this.

391
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:33,558
<i>That's okay.</i>

392
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,393
That's why
we're getting together,

393
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,896
you know, talk about
this kind of stuff.

394
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:40,732
Barry, it sounds like
you might be feeling left out.

395
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,192
Oh.
No.

396
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:44,778
Sometimes I do.

397
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,738
And it's not just me.
It's Erica, too.

398
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,282
Oh, now he's just
being dramatic.

399
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:50,700
Erica gets a lot
of attention,

400
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,827
and she's just a joy.

401
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,915
Dang it, the
screen won't break.

402
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,459
Bet it'll break
if we blow it up.

403
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,383
I love her.

404
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,676
Fine, you're right.

405
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,927
Erica's doing just great.

406
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,054
Nothing to worry about there.

407
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,226
Oh, come on.

408
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,729
You got any matches?

409
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,106
Be right back.

410
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,072
While she's gone,
you want to make out?

411
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,657
Sure.

412
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,743
You actually believe
in the multiverse theory?

413
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:34,995
Very much so.

414
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,579
It's the most elegant
interpretation

415
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,456
of quantum mechanics.

416
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,960
So you really think there are
an infinite number of universes?

417
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:44,879
Stephen Hawking believes it,
so, yes, I do.

418
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:48,591
Well, if there are
an infinite number of universes,

419
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,802
I think that theory's dumb
in all of them.

420
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,681
This is fun.

421
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,200
I don't get to have
discussions like this

422
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,767
with kids at my school.

423
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:58,852
Do you?

424
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,479
No.

425
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,531
Do you ever wish you were
just like everyone else?

426
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,451
Not at all.

427
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,744
Me neither.

428
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:18,079
I love being smarter
than everyone.

429
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:19,873
Me, too.

430
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,750
<i>I started
to think that Paige and I</i>

431
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,085
<i>might have more in common
than I thought.</i>

432
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,253
<i>Maybe my mother was right.</i>

433
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:28,965
<i>I really did just need
to get to know her better.</i>

434
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:31,342
Checkmate!

435
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:32,719
You lose.

436
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,429
<i>Red alert.</i>

437
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,514
<i>Phasers stand by to fire
on my order.</i>

438
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:39,642
Guess that makes
me the smartest.

439
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,102
<i>I don't know
if ten-year-old Spock</i>

440
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:42,771
<i>ever flipped a chess board,</i>

441
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:45,356
<i>but ten-year-old Sheldon
sure did.</i>

442
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,738
<i>You know Paige
always comes first...</i>

443
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:54,324
Got to say, I'm glad
we invited 'em over.

444
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,701
Don't you get him another beer.

445
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,661
Come on. You love this
and you know it.

446
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,915
They're as messed up as we are.

447
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,833
Fine. But one more
and that's it.

448
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,087
<i>- Whoa!
- Yes!</i>

449
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,380
<i>Holy crap!</i>

450
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:12,884
Don't you...
Go out there and check!

451
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,640
Now, does anyone know
what happens to quarks

452
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:22,018
when we combine them
to make mesons and baryons?

453
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:24,979
Yes, Paige.

454
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:26,689
We can ignore
the particle masses

455
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,608
at the individual quark level.

456
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,401
Correct.

457
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,695
You are really...

458
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,991
He's jealous of you
paying attention to her.

459
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,453
That was correct, Paige.

460
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:42,997
And, Sheldon,

461
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:45,291
is that a new bow tie?

462
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,460
It is.

463
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,045
Lookin' sharp!

464
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,005
Thanks.

465
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:52,757
That was a close one.

466
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,717
As I was saying,
the only...

1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,258
So, you can see that
Sheldon has a baby tooth

2
00:00:04,261 --> 00:00:06,638
- that never fell out.
- Is that a problem?

3
00:00:06,641 --> 00:00:09,056
Well, it's gonna keep the adult
tooth from coming down, and...

4
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:10,600
it's gonna need to be extracted.

5
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:13,478
Oh, he is not gonna be happy about that.

6
00:00:13,479 --> 00:00:14,960
No, he is not.

7
00:00:14,963 --> 00:00:17,381
Are you sure we can't
just wait this thing out?

8
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:19,192
It's gonna cause all the other
teeth around it to come in

9
00:00:19,193 --> 00:00:22,029
crooked and, well, you know,
braces can be expensive.

10
00:00:23,573 --> 00:00:26,533
He is gonna freak out about the pain

11
00:00:26,534 --> 00:00:28,507
and the needle and the blood.

12
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,328
Yeah, I wouldn't mention
that stuff when you tell him.

13
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:32,664
Uh, can't you tell him?

14
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:33,999
I'm not gonna tell him.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,328
- But you're his doctor.
- And you're his mommy.

16
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:38,628
Which means that I have to
deal with him all the time.

17
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:40,672
- Help me out here.
- No.

18
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:43,433
Okay. Can we tell him together?

19
00:00:43,436 --> 00:00:44,521
No.

20
00:00:46,304 --> 00:00:47,971
All right.

21
00:00:47,972 --> 00:00:51,850
What if I put your business
card, free of charge,

22
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:55,063
in the next church newsletter?

23
00:00:56,355 --> 00:00:59,691
So, Sheldon, little bit of dental news.

24
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:01,526
You have a baby tooth

25
00:01:01,527 --> 00:01:02,861
that never fell out.

26
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:04,863
Neat. Even my teeth are stubborn.

27
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:09,701
Anyway, in order for your
teeth to come in straight,

28
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:12,537
Dr. Bowers is gonna need to pull it out.

29
00:01:12,538 --> 00:01:14,873
Why didn't I hear this from him?

30
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:16,281
I had the same question.

31
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:19,044
But a tooth extraction
is a major procedure.

32
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,545
Not necessarily.

33
00:01:20,546 --> 00:01:22,062
Will there be blood?

34
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:23,156
A little.

35
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,201
Will there be a needle?

36
00:01:24,204 --> 00:01:25,536
Maybe, but you won't feel it,

37
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:27,164
'cause he's gonna put you under first.

38
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:28,885
Put me under? With drugs?

39
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:30,222
That's even more dangerous.

40
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,432
Sheldon, lots of people
get their teeth pulled.

41
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:33,851
It's not a big deal.

42
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:36,728
Stop enjoying this.

43
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:38,396
- Sorry.
- No, you're not.

44
00:01:38,397 --> 00:01:40,565
No, I'm not.

45
00:01:51,632 --> 00:01:58,492

46
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:05,757
This is not exactly the
date night I'd envisioned

47
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:07,884
when I was shaving my legs.

48
00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:08,953
I'm almost done.

49
00:02:08,956 --> 00:02:10,051
We're elderly, you know?

50
00:02:10,054 --> 00:02:11,992
If anything, dinner should be early.

51
00:02:11,995 --> 00:02:13,598
Well, I'll tell you
what, when I'm finished,

52
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,768
I am gonna whisk you
off to the finest...

53
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:19,484
and the only... Chinese
food place in town.

54
00:02:19,487 --> 00:02:22,730
Ying's? Their nachos are weird.

55
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:24,734
I don't know, it's not a bad idea

56
00:02:24,735 --> 00:02:28,085
to maybe venture out of
Medford once in a while.

57
00:02:28,088 --> 00:02:30,548
Even better, why don't we
go away for the weekend?

58
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,282
Uh, come on... You know how hard it is

59
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,965
for me to get out of the store.

60
00:02:33,968 --> 00:02:35,367
What's the point of being the boss

61
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,747
if you can't get somebody
else to do your work for you?

62
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:41,501
Uh, I might be able to
leave Georgie in charge.

63
00:02:41,502 --> 00:02:43,128
My grandson?

64
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,718
That'd be the one.

65
00:02:44,721 --> 00:02:47,797
I want to go, so I'm just
gonna say "good idea."

66
00:02:53,264 --> 00:02:55,750
Hi, Sheldon, what can I do for you?

67
00:02:55,753 --> 00:02:58,933
Do you have any books or
videos on the Lamaze technique?

68
00:02:58,936 --> 00:03:01,242
Uh-oh. Georgie get that girl pregnant?

69
00:03:01,245 --> 00:03:03,192
It's for me. I need
to have a tooth pulled,

70
00:03:03,195 --> 00:03:05,692
and I'd like to do it without
putting my brain on drugs.

71
00:03:05,693 --> 00:03:07,171
Okay.

72
00:03:07,174 --> 00:03:09,819
I've seen that commercial
with the egg in the frying pan.

73
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,031
Very effective.

74
00:03:11,034 --> 00:03:14,054
Well, since this is a high
school, we don't have material

75
00:03:14,057 --> 00:03:16,417
about giving birth on the shelves.

76
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,754
But...

77
00:03:17,757 --> 00:03:19,456
since this is a high school,

78
00:03:19,457 --> 00:03:24,002
I keep a few things
here under the counter.

79
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,507
Excellent.

80
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,677
And I'll let my brother know,

81
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,224
in case he gets himself in a pickle.

82
00:03:35,612 --> 00:03:38,181
You're having a tooth
pulled, not having a baby.

83
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:41,519
If it can work for getting
an eight-pound human

84
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,522
through a birth canal, it
can work for a tiny tooth.

85
00:03:44,523 --> 00:03:47,192
Eight pounds? I'm never having kids.

86
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,986
Fun fact: she ended up having four.

87
00:03:49,987 --> 00:03:53,698
And if I do, I'm taking
any drugs they'll give me.

88
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:55,700
That part was true.

89
00:03:57,054 --> 00:03:58,537
Hey, Georgie.

90
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:01,371
I'm thinking about
taking your meemaw away

91
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:02,707
for this weekend.

92
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:05,043
Okay. You have my blessing.

93
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,087
Thank you. And I was wondering, maybe,

94
00:04:07,088 --> 00:04:09,422
if you'd look after the
store while I'm gone.

95
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:11,117
You saying I'm the manager?

96
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,875
No, I-I'm saying I want
you to look after the store

97
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,503
while I'm gone.

98
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:17,845
But in a managerial capacity.

99
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:20,734
You think you can handle it?

100
00:04:20,737 --> 00:04:22,613
Yes, sir. I will make you proud.

101
00:04:22,616 --> 00:04:23,741
Great.

102
00:04:23,744 --> 00:04:24,911
Can I fire people?

103
00:04:24,914 --> 00:04:26,122
No.

104
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,126
- Can I get paid more?
- No.

105
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:30,375
Can I at least change
the music we play here?

106
00:04:30,378 --> 00:04:32,379
What's wrong with the
music we play here?

107
00:04:32,382 --> 00:04:35,363
Nothing, it's just
kind of grandpa music.

108
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:38,243
Well, how is this "grandpa music"?

109
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:39,632
Do you listen to it?

110
00:04:39,635 --> 00:04:40,844
Yeah.

111
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,432
- Do you have grandchildren?
- Yeah.

112
00:04:43,435 --> 00:04:45,311
Do you see where I'm going with this?

113
00:04:48,613 --> 00:04:50,322
Okay, Sheldon, you ready?

114
00:04:50,325 --> 00:04:51,451
Not really.

115
00:04:51,454 --> 00:04:52,871
Yeah, that makes two of us.

116
00:04:52,874 --> 00:04:54,083
Why don't you guys come on back?

117
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,132
You know what? I'm just gonna stay here.

118
00:04:56,135 --> 00:04:58,164
Um, you don't need me
getting in your way.

119
00:04:58,167 --> 00:04:59,460
Oh, it's no trouble at all. Come on.

120
00:04:59,462 --> 00:05:00,838
I've got my crochet.

121
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:03,070
- You're coming.
- Fine.

122
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:08,883
So, you don't need
to worry about needles

123
00:05:08,886 --> 00:05:10,811
'cause we're gonna put you
under for the procedure.

124
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:13,731
No, thank you. There are risks
associated with anesthesia.

125
00:05:13,732 --> 00:05:15,329
Feel free to jump in.

126
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:16,791
Are there any other options?

127
00:05:16,794 --> 00:05:18,152
Well, he could stay awake
for it, but we'd have

128
00:05:18,153 --> 00:05:19,320
to give him novocaine.

129
00:05:19,321 --> 00:05:21,155
No needles. Just pull the tooth.

130
00:05:21,156 --> 00:05:23,616
Okay. Just so you know...

131
00:05:23,617 --> 00:05:25,369
I'm gonna be using this.

132
00:05:29,122 --> 00:05:30,624
Drugs, please.

133
00:05:32,668 --> 00:05:35,002
You go to this casino often?

134
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:36,438
Kind of.

135
00:05:36,441 --> 00:05:39,365
So don't be surprised if
everybody knows my name,

136
00:05:39,368 --> 00:05:42,258
how I take my whiskey and
the color of my lucky bra.

137
00:05:42,261 --> 00:05:43,469
Purple.

138
00:05:43,472 --> 00:05:45,390
No, that's my "get lucky" bra.

139
00:05:46,515 --> 00:05:50,017
So, what are you into? Craps, roulette?

140
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:52,186
Well, not much of a gambler.

141
00:05:52,187 --> 00:05:57,525
You just left Georgie in charge
of your store, so... disagree.

142
00:05:57,526 --> 00:06:01,487
Mm, he's a lot smarter than you think.

143
00:06:01,488 --> 00:06:04,991
Maybe you're not as smart as I think.

144
00:06:04,992 --> 00:06:08,536
Well, if you like me just for
my body, I'm okay with that.

145
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,541
♪ If you could hear me think,
this is what I'd say... ♪

146
00:06:15,544 --> 00:06:18,337
There you go. I hope you
enjoyed your shopping experience.

147
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:20,146
- I did.
- I'd let the manager know,

148
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:22,259
but he already does, 'cause it's me.

149
00:06:23,552 --> 00:06:24,552
I'll take it.

150
00:06:24,553 --> 00:06:27,179
It's been a pleasure to serve you.

151
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,056
You might want to slow
down. We don't have a license

152
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:31,524
to sell guns in here.

153
00:06:31,527 --> 00:06:33,883
Just kidding, it's Texas.
We got them in the back.

154
00:06:34,914 --> 00:06:36,897
Okay, Sheldon, we're
gonna put the mask on.

155
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:39,900
Now you just breathe normally
and count back from 100.

156
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:41,319
But counting back from 100

157
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,738
isn't complex enough to occupy my mind.

158
00:06:43,739 --> 00:06:45,573
You're up again.

159
00:06:45,574 --> 00:06:49,744
Why don't you think of
something more sciencey?

160
00:06:49,745 --> 00:06:51,245
Like counting pi.

161
00:06:51,246 --> 00:06:53,122
That's a thing, right? Pi?

162
00:06:53,123 --> 00:06:56,042
I can't count pi, it's
an irrational number.

163
00:06:56,043 --> 00:06:59,045
But I can embrace the spirit
of your proposal and calculate

164
00:06:59,046 --> 00:07:00,421
the matrix coefficients

165
00:07:00,422 --> 00:07:02,508
necessary for a unified field theory.

166
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:03,759
Do that. Hit it.

167
00:07:06,094 --> 00:07:08,387
Of the four fundamental forces,

168
00:07:08,388 --> 00:07:13,643
the most difficult to
unify is gravity because...

169
00:07:13,644 --> 00:07:15,062
Oh, thank God.

170
00:07:21,902 --> 00:07:23,487
Step right up.

171
00:07:25,072 --> 00:07:27,239
Step right up

172
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,785
for your chance to meet Thoth!

173
00:07:30,786 --> 00:07:34,508
The Egyptian god of knowledge.

174
00:07:34,511 --> 00:07:37,956
He has all the answers.

175
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:41,295
No question too big

176
00:07:41,296 --> 00:07:42,797
or small.

177
00:07:42,798 --> 00:07:44,883
Hello, young man.

178
00:07:44,886 --> 00:07:48,289
Do you have a question
you'd like to pose?

179
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:51,085
I do, but nobody in
the history of science

180
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:52,755
has ever been able to answer it.

181
00:07:52,758 --> 00:07:58,347
Well, they haven't asked
the great god Thoth!

182
00:07:59,815 --> 00:08:03,360
Right this way!

183
00:08:15,497 --> 00:08:17,289
Ask your question.

184
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:20,835
Do you really possess all knowledge?

185
00:08:20,836 --> 00:08:23,504
You only get one question, kid.

186
00:08:23,505 --> 00:08:25,157
You want that to be it?

187
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,506
Oh. No.

188
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:30,344
How can I unify the
four fundamental forces

189
00:08:30,345 --> 00:08:31,846
of the universe?

190
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:33,594
Now we're talking.

191
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:37,475
In order to unify gravity,
you must first understand

192
00:08:37,478 --> 00:08:40,352
that it is a distortion of space-time.

193
00:08:40,355 --> 00:08:42,940
Gravity. Of course.

194
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:45,735
He even talks in his sleep.
Why am I not surprised?

195
00:08:48,191 --> 00:08:50,904
Didn't feel it at all. That's
how good this helmet is.

196
00:08:50,907 --> 00:08:52,950
Want to take a whack?

197
00:08:52,951 --> 00:08:55,102
Try it on.

198
00:08:55,105 --> 00:08:57,266
I'll be up front when
you're ready to buy it.

199
00:09:01,973 --> 00:09:03,891
Oh, no.

200
00:09:06,214 --> 00:09:08,094
Damn it.

201
00:09:11,553 --> 00:09:13,193
26 for the twins'

202
00:09:13,196 --> 00:09:18,392
birthday, three for Georgie
and Mary wouldn't like it

203
00:09:18,393 --> 00:09:22,521
if I used her birthday for
gambling, so 13 for her.

204
00:09:22,522 --> 00:09:26,066
All right. For my grandson's
birthday, I'm gonna go black,

205
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:27,579
'cause I don't remember.

206
00:09:27,582 --> 00:09:28,954
No more bets.

207
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:32,727
26 black.

208
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,939
Whoa! Yep! Hey-ah!

209
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:36,719
Hooray for the grandkids!

210
00:09:36,722 --> 00:09:39,349
Whenever the hell they were born!

211
00:09:39,352 --> 00:09:40,519
You want to go to the bar?

212
00:09:40,522 --> 00:09:41,532
No, we've hit.

213
00:09:41,535 --> 00:09:42,719
We gotta ride this out.

214
00:09:42,722 --> 00:09:44,625
Double zero.

215
00:09:44,628 --> 00:09:46,838
- Ride's over.
- To the bar!

216
00:09:53,141 --> 00:09:54,720
Where am I?

217
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:56,758
Oh, you died. You're a ghost now.

218
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:58,220
What?

219
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,390
Look who's awake.

220
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:02,561
How are you feelin'?

221
00:10:02,562 --> 00:10:04,772
I had a dream.

222
00:10:04,773 --> 00:10:07,817
I solved a unified field theory.

223
00:10:07,818 --> 00:10:09,944
Well, good for you.

224
00:10:09,945 --> 00:10:11,688
But I can't remember it.

225
00:10:11,691 --> 00:10:12,858
Hmm.

226
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:14,586
Well, you were mumblin' something

227
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:17,407
about gravity and forces.

228
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,787
You need to be more specific.

229
00:10:19,788 --> 00:10:22,000
Shelly, you weren't makin' much sense.

230
00:10:22,003 --> 00:10:26,372
Mother, a unified field theory
is the holy grail of physics.

231
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,664
Solving it would be the
greatest breakthrough

232
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:30,668
in the history of science.

233
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:31,966
And you forgot it.

234
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:33,009
That's funny.

235
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,173
Hello, Dr. Bowers, it's Sheldon Cooper.

236
00:10:38,174 --> 00:10:40,843
I need you to administer
more anesthesia to me.

237
00:10:40,844 --> 00:10:43,011
No, I don't have a dental problem.

238
00:10:43,012 --> 00:10:45,639
I need to reenter a trancelike
state so I can communicate

239
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,100
with Thoth, the god of knowledge.

240
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,850
I would argue that the
greatest discovery in physics

241
00:10:50,853 --> 00:10:53,188
is worth losing your dental license.

242
00:10:53,189 --> 00:10:54,815
Well, it's not my fault you let them

243
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:56,369
publish your home phone number.

244
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:00,028
Well, this is my favorite table here.

245
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:04,534
Well, sure, every time you
put down money, you win.

246
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:07,669
Oh, this is nice.

247
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,640
You know, I really don't get
away from the store enough.

248
00:11:14,043 --> 00:11:16,524
How come you're still
workin' at your age?

249
00:11:16,527 --> 00:11:17,879
What do you mean "my age"?

250
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,339
I mean you're old.

251
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,841
I'm not old.

252
00:11:20,842 --> 00:11:22,968
Well, I'm old and you're older than me.

253
00:11:22,969 --> 00:11:24,836
Yeah, that's true.

254
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:26,722
But we make it look good though.

255
00:11:26,723 --> 00:11:28,390
You don't want to be that guy

256
00:11:28,391 --> 00:11:30,892
that just works till he drops dead.

257
00:11:30,893 --> 00:11:33,365
I mean, maybe you should retire.

258
00:11:33,368 --> 00:11:35,022
Have a little fun.

259
00:11:35,023 --> 00:11:36,565
Well, I'm here with you.

260
00:11:36,566 --> 00:11:39,461
That's a good start, 'cause I'm fun.

261
00:11:39,464 --> 00:11:41,361
Oh, man, you sure as hell are.

262
00:11:44,907 --> 00:11:46,742
Hey, you know what'd be fun?

263
00:11:46,743 --> 00:11:49,202
New Orleans is just
an hour away from here.

264
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:51,580
Oh, I like where this is headed.

265
00:11:51,581 --> 00:11:54,974
And they got themselves a 24-hour

266
00:11:54,977 --> 00:11:57,336
wedding chapel.

267
00:11:57,337 --> 00:11:59,047
What?

268
00:12:00,256 --> 00:12:01,985
No!

269
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:03,314
What do you mean "no"?

270
00:12:03,317 --> 00:12:05,872
We're good together and we're both old.

271
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,304
That's what you said.

272
00:12:07,305 --> 00:12:10,086
We-we haven't even
said "I love you" yet!

273
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:11,308
All right, fine.

274
00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:12,894
I love you.

275
00:12:16,314 --> 00:12:19,633
You... you're not
gonna say anything back?

276
00:12:19,636 --> 00:12:21,638
Not under these circumstances!

277
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,818
Ah, goddang it.

278
00:12:29,194 --> 00:12:31,238
Dale?!

279
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:35,689
I'd like to report

280
00:12:35,692 --> 00:12:37,829
a robbery.

281
00:12:37,832 --> 00:12:40,794
Well, before I tell you my name,
is there any way we can do this

282
00:12:40,797 --> 00:12:44,299
where the owner of the
store don't find out?

283
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,261
Because he left me in charge
and I really screwed up.

284
00:12:48,262 --> 00:12:50,973
At least $400.

285
00:12:50,974 --> 00:12:52,766
I know it's a lot.

286
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:54,394
That's why I said I screwed up.

287
00:12:56,979 --> 00:12:58,766
I got to think about this.

288
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:01,438
I-I'll call you back.

289
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:03,985
If I was going to recapture my insight

290
00:13:03,986 --> 00:13:07,204
into a unified field theory,
I needed to find a way

291
00:13:07,207 --> 00:13:11,324
to put myself back into an
altered state of consciousness.

292
00:13:11,327 --> 00:13:12,985
Native Americans would

293
00:13:12,988 --> 00:13:16,329
sit in sweat lodges for
hours to achieve this.

294
00:13:16,332 --> 00:13:19,673
I lasted a minute and a half.

295
00:13:19,676 --> 00:13:22,001
Self-hypnosis is another means

296
00:13:22,004 --> 00:13:24,838
of bringing stillness to the mind.

297
00:13:26,832 --> 00:13:29,177
When it isn't giving you a heart attack!

298
00:13:29,178 --> 00:13:31,782
The whirling dervishes of Central Asia

299
00:13:31,785 --> 00:13:34,092
employ a repetitive spinning technique

300
00:13:34,095 --> 00:13:37,227
to achieve a trancelike state.

301
00:13:49,441 --> 00:13:51,151
You didn't have to storm off.

302
00:13:53,828 --> 00:13:55,955
You're being childish.

303
00:13:56,966 --> 00:13:58,392
So I don't want to get married.

304
00:13:58,395 --> 00:14:00,039
It's nothing personal.

305
00:14:00,042 --> 00:14:02,665
Well, it feels personal.

306
00:14:02,668 --> 00:14:03,962
I'm not rejecting you.

307
00:14:03,965 --> 00:14:05,759
I'm rejecting marriage.

308
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,868
If it helps, it's not the first proposal

309
00:14:08,871 --> 00:14:10,163
I've turned down.

310
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,793
How the hell does that help?

311
00:14:12,796 --> 00:14:15,235
After everything that I've done

312
00:14:15,238 --> 00:14:17,364
for you and your family!

313
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:20,435
You give my grandson a job,
so I'm supposed to marry you?

314
00:14:20,438 --> 00:14:24,066
Well, you can forget I even asked.

315
00:14:28,187 --> 00:14:31,481
After my other attempts
to return to the trancelike

316
00:14:31,484 --> 00:14:34,486
state of anesthesia failed,
I turned to something

317
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:38,032
Nancy Reagan herself told
me to "just say no" to.

318
00:14:38,035 --> 00:14:41,359
My mind-altering
substance of choice was...

319
00:14:41,362 --> 00:14:42,863
chamomile tea.

320
00:14:42,866 --> 00:14:45,587
But not your grandma's chamomile tea.

321
00:14:45,588 --> 00:14:49,800
A highly concentrated super
chamomile of my own making.

322
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:54,262
All the relaxing power of
30 cups of chamomile tea

323
00:14:54,263 --> 00:14:55,884
packed into a teaspoon

324
00:14:55,887 --> 00:14:58,222
of calming sludge.

325
00:14:58,225 --> 00:15:00,060
Sorry, Mrs. Reagan.

326
00:15:22,124 --> 00:15:24,626
Okay, grand unified field theory,

327
00:15:24,627 --> 00:15:26,629
here I come.

328
00:15:43,813 --> 00:15:45,915
This isn't working.

329
00:15:45,918 --> 00:15:48,815
I disagree.

330
00:15:48,818 --> 00:15:53,321
Seems to be working fine and dandy.

331
00:15:53,324 --> 00:15:55,712
Mr. Einstein?

332
00:15:55,715 --> 00:15:57,657
I'm very excited to talk to you,

333
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,911
but I was hoping to hear

334
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:00,915
from Thoth, the Egyptian
god of knowledge,

335
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,961
so he could teach me the grand
unified field theory again.

336
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,430
Ooh, the grand unified field theory!

337
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:09,018
Well, la-di-da.

338
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:12,839
He told it to me in a
dream, but I can't remember.

339
00:16:12,842 --> 00:16:14,954
All right, hang on.

340
00:16:14,957 --> 00:16:16,548
Where is the fun in finding

341
00:16:16,551 --> 00:16:19,345
things out if some
joker with a bird head

342
00:16:19,348 --> 00:16:21,474
just tells you the answer?

343
00:16:21,475 --> 00:16:24,985
But a grand unified field theory
would explain the universe.

344
00:16:24,988 --> 00:16:26,947
Answers are all well and good,

345
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,970
but a real scientist loves
the thrill of the chase.

346
00:16:29,973 --> 00:16:31,265
Am I right, Hawking?

347
00:16:31,268 --> 00:16:32,817
I would agree.

348
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,212
I do also enjoy the thrill

349
00:16:35,215 --> 00:16:38,083
of rolling over bubble
wrap with my chair.

350
00:16:38,086 --> 00:16:41,720
It-it is fun to pop
that stuff, isn't it?

351
00:16:41,723 --> 00:16:44,501
- So fun.
- But what if I never figure it out?

352
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,868
I never did

353
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:48,331
and my scientific career
is nothing to sneeze at.

354
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:50,210
- Same here.
- Agreed.

355
00:16:50,213 --> 00:16:52,298
Uh, don't-don't look at me.

356
00:16:52,301 --> 00:16:54,636
I-I drive a Yugo.

357
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,649
So none of you can help me?

358
00:16:56,652 --> 00:16:58,445
I believe I can.

359
00:16:58,448 --> 00:17:02,087
Sheldon, if I was offered
a choice between all

360
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,683
the knowledge of the universe
or the endless pursuit of it,

361
00:17:05,686 --> 00:17:08,063
I would choose the pursuit.

362
00:17:09,271 --> 00:17:10,712
That's very insightful.

363
00:17:10,715 --> 00:17:12,798
Hold it, hold it... he
didn't come up with that!

364
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:15,063
He stole it from Gotthold Lessing.

365
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:17,734
Who's-who's Gotthold Lessing?

366
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:21,196
He's an 18th century German philosopher.

367
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,626
Now do you mind?

368
00:17:22,629 --> 00:17:25,993
We girls are trying to
have some fun over here.

369
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:27,663
- Apologies.
- Sorry, Cyndi Lauper.

370
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:28,833
Our bad.

371
00:17:28,836 --> 00:17:30,671
I-I like fun.

372
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:34,109
While I made my peace

373
00:17:34,112 --> 00:17:37,079
with not having the solution
to a unified field theory,

374
00:17:37,082 --> 00:17:39,345
my intestines did not make peace

375
00:17:39,348 --> 00:17:41,724
with concentrated chamomile syrup.

376
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,353
Oh, dear.

377
00:17:43,356 --> 00:17:46,563
Bathroom emergency! Bathroom emergency!

378
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,667
What the hell?

379
00:17:54,347 --> 00:17:55,848
I locked this.

380
00:17:57,515 --> 00:17:59,015
Who's here?

381
00:17:59,018 --> 00:18:01,186
I'll call the cops!

382
00:18:01,187 --> 00:18:02,771
It's just me.

383
00:18:02,772 --> 00:18:05,357
Why you back so soon?

384
00:18:05,358 --> 00:18:06,818
None of your business.

385
00:18:07,985 --> 00:18:09,403
How'd it go yesterday?

386
00:18:09,404 --> 00:18:10,862
It was good.

387
00:18:10,863 --> 00:18:12,697
Until it wasn't.

388
00:18:12,698 --> 00:18:14,074
What do you mean?

389
00:18:14,075 --> 00:18:17,077
I was helping a customer,

390
00:18:17,078 --> 00:18:19,734
and I guess I forgot
to close the register,

391
00:18:19,737 --> 00:18:23,166
'cause when I got back to
it, all the money was gone.

392
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:24,668
Are you kidding me?

393
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:26,044
I screwed up.

394
00:18:26,045 --> 00:18:27,511
Did you call the police?

395
00:18:27,514 --> 00:18:29,140
I didn't want to get them involved.

396
00:18:29,143 --> 00:18:31,467
But I was gonna make it right.

397
00:18:32,518 --> 00:18:34,895
Here, take it.

398
00:18:38,477 --> 00:18:39,686
So we good?

399
00:18:40,393 --> 00:18:42,394
You're fired.

400
00:18:42,395 --> 00:18:44,062
R-Really?

401
00:18:44,063 --> 00:18:47,409
Get out of my store now.

402
00:18:47,412 --> 00:18:52,673

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,048
Previously on Young Sheldon...

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,056
All right, let me start

3
00:00:03,058 --> 00:00:05,089
by saying that I owe you an apology.

4
00:00:05,091 --> 00:00:08,009
I want you to know that
I'm trying to change.

5
00:00:08,011 --> 00:00:09,274
What do you want from me?

6
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:10,720
One more chance.

7
00:00:10,722 --> 00:00:12,970
Thanks again for giving me another shot.

8
00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:15,915
Well, I'm trying to get
better at forgiving people.

9
00:00:15,917 --> 00:00:17,423
Well, I'm glad to hear you say that,

10
00:00:17,425 --> 00:00:19,646
'cause I'm the one who
egged your store last night.

11
00:00:19,648 --> 00:00:22,217
Hmm, forgiving people sucks.

12
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:23,525
Should we say grace?

13
00:00:23,527 --> 00:00:24,814
Heck yeah!

14
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:27,429
Oh, cool, let's say grace.

15
00:00:27,431 --> 00:00:28,431
Well?

16
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:29,826
It's very...

17
00:00:29,828 --> 00:00:31,228
colorful.

18
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,014
Check out the best part.

19
00:00:36,315 --> 00:00:38,274
Want to try it out?

20
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,407
As long as I can remember,

21
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:44,825
unlocking the mechanisms that
govern the physical universe

22
00:00:44,827 --> 00:00:46,907
was my greatest passion.

23
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:49,939
- Whatcha workin' on?
- Dungeons & Dragons.

24
00:00:49,941 --> 00:00:51,095
Hey, even Hawking took

25
00:00:51,097 --> 00:00:52,939
a roll through the park once in a while.

26
00:00:52,941 --> 00:00:55,689
I'm working on a new campaign
to play with Tam and Billy.

27
00:00:55,691 --> 00:00:57,650
You know how I feel about that game.

28
00:00:57,652 --> 00:00:59,742
I'm aware, which is why
the most wicked thing

29
00:00:59,744 --> 00:01:01,406
in it is my sense of humor.

30
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:05,077
I still don't like it.

31
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:08,556
But you are playing with other
kids, so I'll take it as a win.

32
00:01:08,558 --> 00:01:10,691
Not just playing with other kids,

33
00:01:10,693 --> 00:01:12,913
controlling every aspect

34
00:01:12,915 --> 00:01:16,642
of their destiny as their
Dungeon Master overlord.

35
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:19,469
I didn't believe in God but
I sure loved acting like one.

36
00:01:20,558 --> 00:01:21,861
Hey, Mary.

37
00:01:21,863 --> 00:01:24,126
Wayne, come on in. Thank you.

38
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:26,517
George just ran to pick up some beers.

39
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,042
It's funny when he runs, ain't it?

40
00:01:28,044 --> 00:01:29,565
Oh, hey, Darlene wanted

41
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:31,766
to know if you were gonna
packanything nice to wear.

42
00:01:31,769 --> 00:01:32,960
For what?

43
00:01:32,962 --> 00:01:34,788
The coaches conference.

44
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,125
I wasn't going to that.

45
00:01:36,128 --> 00:01:37,432
Darlene's going?

46
00:01:37,435 --> 00:01:39,182
A free weekend in San Antonio?

47
00:01:39,185 --> 00:01:40,547
Hotel on the river?

48
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,838
Of course she's going.

49
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,836
Oh.

50
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:44,405
Did George not invite you?

51
00:01:44,408 --> 00:01:46,617
No, he didn't.

52
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,627
Honestly, what is wrong with that man?

53
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,067
Game time!

54
00:01:53,522 --> 00:01:54,999
What?

55
00:01:55,002 --> 00:01:57,723
Mom's just mad I'm
playing Dungeons & Dragons.

56
00:01:57,726 --> 00:01:59,118
Oh, good.

57

59
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:22,024
I didn't know
he was bringing his wife.

60
00:02:22,027 --> 00:02:25,204
And of course it didn't
even occur to you to ask me?

61
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:27,235
Well, no, but isn't that better

62
00:02:27,238 --> 00:02:29,455
than thinking about it
and then not doing it?

63
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,146
They both make you a jerk.

64
00:02:31,149 --> 00:02:32,950
Since when are you interested

65
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,648
in a coaches conference?

66
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,633
I am interested in a weekend

67
00:02:36,636 --> 00:02:39,521
at a nice hotel by a river.

68
00:02:39,524 --> 00:02:41,570
Hotel is pretty nice.

69
00:02:44,224 --> 00:02:45,615
What's up?

70
00:02:45,617 --> 00:02:47,051
Watching the game with your dad.

71
00:02:47,053 --> 00:02:48,052
Where is he?

72
00:02:48,054 --> 00:02:50,402
Getting yelled at by your mom.

73
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:51,797
Cool.

74
00:02:54,104 --> 00:02:56,680
Any chance you might want to
watch the kids this weekend?

75
00:02:56,683 --> 00:02:58,849
- Sure, no problem.
- Good.

76
00:02:58,852 --> 00:03:00,891
I thought you and Dalemight have plans.

77
00:03:00,893 --> 00:03:03,024
We might hang out, but...

78
00:03:03,026 --> 00:03:04,634
it's fine.

79
00:03:04,636 --> 00:03:06,114
Something going on?

80
00:03:06,116 --> 00:03:07,942
Mm-mm.

81
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:10,118
Sounds like something.

82
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,642
Well...

83
00:03:12,644 --> 00:03:16,603
he's trying to be a
better person, and...

84
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:18,039
it's weird.

85
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,040
Weird how?

86
00:03:19,042 --> 00:03:20,955
Just doesn't seem natural.

87
00:03:20,957 --> 00:03:22,957
I don't follow.

88
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,003
Like when you see a
dancing bear at the circus,

89
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:30,094
and you know it just wants
to rip some clown's head off.

90
00:03:30,096 --> 00:03:32,575
That's graphic.

91
00:03:32,577 --> 00:03:34,272
Where are y'all going?

92
00:03:34,274 --> 00:03:36,753
George has a coaches
conferencein San Antonio.

93
00:03:36,755 --> 00:03:39,165
Oh, and you weaseled
your way in? Good for you.

94
00:03:39,168 --> 00:03:40,322
I didn't weasel.

95
00:03:40,324 --> 00:03:41,845
So it was his idea?

96
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,325
Not exactly.

97
00:03:43,327 --> 00:03:46,807
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a weasel.

98
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:50,680
Congratulations.

99
00:03:58,035 --> 00:03:59,341
Getting ready for your trip?

100
00:03:59,343 --> 00:04:00,519
Yep.

101
00:04:00,522 --> 00:04:02,173
Dale told me you're taking his camper.

102
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,738
Yeah. We're gonna head down
with Wayne and his wife.

103
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,915
Cool.

104
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:09,177
Just out of curiosity,

105
00:04:09,179 --> 00:04:11,179
when exactly are you and Mom leaving,

106
00:04:11,181 --> 00:04:13,272
and when exactly are y'all coming back?

107
00:04:13,275 --> 00:04:15,101
You're not bringing
your girlfriend here.

108
00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:18,236
Excuse me for taking an
interest in your life.

109
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,320
Besides, your grandma'll
be here the whole time.

110
00:04:21,253 --> 00:04:23,146
Never mind.

111
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:24,758
Wait.

112
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,639
So her house'll be empty?

113
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,464
Look, I used to be your age,

114
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:30,894
but can you try thinking
with your brain for once?

115
00:04:30,897 --> 00:04:32,015
If you used to be my age,

116
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:33,581
I think you know the answer to that.

117
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:39,163
All right, baby,

118
00:04:39,165 --> 00:04:40,944
we're leaving here in a few minutes,

119
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,241
but we'll be back on Sunday
and your meemaw'll be here.

120
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:47,911
Sheldon?

121
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,347
What?

122
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:50,653
We're leaving.

123
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:52,399
Where are you going?

124
00:04:52,402 --> 00:04:54,793
To San Antonio.

125
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:56,358
When are you leaving?

126
00:04:56,361 --> 00:04:57,491
In a few minutes.

127
00:04:57,494 --> 00:04:58,797
When will you get back?

128
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,358
- Sunday.
- But who's going to watch us?

129
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:02,858
Meemaw.

130
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:04,274
Okay. Bye.

131
00:05:04,277 --> 00:05:06,453
Can you at least give me a hug?

132
00:05:08,064 --> 00:05:09,892
I can.

133
00:05:11,857 --> 00:05:13,931
Hey. Just finishing up.

134
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:16,600
See you again soon.

135
00:05:17,638 --> 00:05:19,290
How you doing?

136
00:05:19,292 --> 00:05:21,684
All right, I guess.

137
00:05:21,686 --> 00:05:23,272
Uh, Dale here?

138
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:25,663
He went to go hang out with
my meemaw, who, by the way,

139
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,725
is at my house all
weekend, so that's a no-go.

140
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:28,874
Okay.

141
00:05:28,877 --> 00:05:30,399
What do you want to do later?

142
00:05:30,402 --> 00:05:32,619
Movies? Putt-putt?

143
00:05:32,622 --> 00:05:35,218
I was thinking maybe
we could go get a test.

144
00:05:35,221 --> 00:05:37,004
What kind of test?

145
00:05:37,006 --> 00:05:39,530
The... pregnancy kind.

146
00:05:40,755 --> 00:05:42,748
We're closed.

147
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:44,098
But the sign says...

148
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,276
We're closed!

149
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:52,473
This can't be happening.
How sure are you?

150
00:05:52,475 --> 00:05:54,406
I'm not sure. That's why
I want to get the test.

151
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:55,911
Well, you don't look pregnant.

152
00:05:55,914 --> 00:05:57,914
That's not how it works, Georgie.

153
00:05:57,917 --> 00:06:00,734
I know. I'm just freaking out right now.

154
00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:03,175
- Let's just go to the drugstore.
- Right.

155
00:06:03,178 --> 00:06:04,656
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

156
00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:06,182
Please don't say that.

157
00:06:06,184 --> 00:06:08,289
So you've stayed at this hotel before?

158
00:06:08,292 --> 00:06:09,664
Oh, yeah. It's nice.

159
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:13,265
They got an indoor pool and
a killer breakfast buffet.

160
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:15,660
There's even a real nice
gym we'll walk right past

161
00:06:15,663 --> 00:06:17,214
on the way to the breakfast buffet.

162
00:06:17,217 --> 00:06:18,912
Why didn't you tell me there was a pool?

163
00:06:18,915 --> 00:06:20,472
I would've brought my bathing suit.

164
00:06:20,475 --> 00:06:23,302
Hotels have pools... didn't
think I needed to mention it.

165
00:06:23,305 --> 00:06:25,542
Well, it would have
been nice if you did.

166
00:06:25,545 --> 00:06:27,058
They also have beds in the rooms.

167
00:06:27,061 --> 00:06:28,519
Did you remember your pajamas?

168
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,034
Okay, you don't have to act

169
00:06:30,037 --> 00:06:31,738
- like that.
- Well, you don't need to blame me

170
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,214
'cause you forgot your bathing suit.

171
00:06:33,217 --> 00:06:35,237
Well, I guess we're
not going in the pool.

172
00:06:36,878 --> 00:06:38,118
Maybe you're not.

173
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,628
I packed my suit.

174
00:06:39,631 --> 00:06:42,409
Are you gonna behave
like this all weekend?

175
00:06:42,412 --> 00:06:44,107
What? Responsible and fun-loving?

176
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,604
Probably.

177
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,693
You are such a...

178
00:06:47,695 --> 00:06:49,695
monkey butt.

179
00:06:49,697 --> 00:06:52,011
Come on.

180
00:06:52,014 --> 00:06:54,214
There's got to be more
insulting name you can call me.

181
00:06:54,217 --> 00:06:56,304
I am sure there is, but
they're about to get in

182
00:06:56,307 --> 00:06:58,097
and they do not need to hear us arguing.

183
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,841
Whoo-wee! Ha-ha! Hey, Mary.

184
00:07:01,844 --> 00:07:03,926
- Darlene, good to see you.
- Oh, hey.

185
00:07:03,928 --> 00:07:05,245
George, how's it going?

186
00:07:05,248 --> 00:07:07,799
Good, good. We were
definitely not arguing

187
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,745
ten seconds ago.

188
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:14,799
I figured we'd order pizza.

189
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:15,801
Okay.

190
00:07:15,804 --> 00:07:17,891
What do you want on it?

191
00:07:17,894 --> 00:07:20,638
Everything except onions,

192
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,902
green peppers, mushrooms,

193
00:07:22,905 --> 00:07:25,294
- spinach...
- No vegetables. Got it.

194
00:07:25,297 --> 00:07:27,167
How about a little salad, too?

195
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:28,603
If you like wasting money.

196
00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:30,692
Spoken like a true Texan.

197
00:07:30,694 --> 00:07:32,607
So what's Sheldon like?

198
00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:33,862
A pain in the ass.

199
00:07:33,865 --> 00:07:37,345
No, he means, what does
Sheldon like on his pizza?

200
00:07:37,348 --> 00:07:39,003
Oh.

201
00:07:39,006 --> 00:07:41,746
Sheldon! What do you
want on your pizza!?

202
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:43,003
Still glad you came?

203
00:07:43,006 --> 00:07:44,441
Actually, I am.

204
00:07:44,444 --> 00:07:46,487
I don't want any pizza.

205
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,359
See? Pain in the ass.

206
00:07:48,362 --> 00:07:50,493
Well, we can get something else.

207
00:07:50,496 --> 00:07:52,409
I don't want anything. I'm not hungry.

208
00:07:52,412 --> 00:07:53,846
Well, what's the matter?

209
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,412
My friends were supposed to play

210
00:07:55,414 --> 00:07:56,805
Dungeons & Dragons with me,

211
00:07:56,807 --> 00:07:58,120
but they cancelled.

212
00:07:58,123 --> 00:07:59,981
Aw. Sorry.

213
00:07:59,984 --> 00:08:01,680
We can play it with you.

214
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:02,942
Really?

215
00:08:02,944 --> 00:08:05,081
Dale, that's nice, but...

216
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,693
I don't think you'll like it.

217
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:08,034
Afraid I might beat you?

218
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:10,573
Actually, there's no one
winner. It's a cooperative game

219
00:08:10,576 --> 00:08:13,534
where you use your imagination
to explore a fantasy world

220
00:08:13,537 --> 00:08:16,128
with the help of the Dungeon
Master's preplanned scenarios

221
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:19,480
and the rolling of polyhedral dice.

222
00:08:19,482 --> 00:08:21,090
Still sound fun?

223
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:22,788
Yeah.

224
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,965
Sorta.

225
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:31,620
I got it.

226
00:08:31,623 --> 00:08:33,667
- Anybody see you?
- No. And I didn't

227
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,277
recognize the guy behind the counter,

228
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,605
but I used an Italian
accent just in case.

229
00:08:37,608 --> 00:08:39,259
Please tell me you're joking.

230
00:08:39,262 --> 00:08:41,393
Oh, I'm-a no joking.

231
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,048
Oh, God.

232
00:08:43,051 --> 00:08:45,244
- Here. Do it.
- I can't do it here.

233
00:08:45,247 --> 00:08:46,768
I have to pee on it.

234
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,862
Okay, fine.

235
00:08:48,865 --> 00:08:51,206
Although we've done
crazier stuff in this truck.

236
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:54,245
Oh, by the way, I made
reservations tonight

237
00:08:54,248 --> 00:08:56,292
at that, uh, steakhouse
on the Riverwalk.

238
00:08:56,295 --> 00:08:58,167
- Ooh, fancy.
- Well, yeah.

239
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,303
Nothing says fancy like
a two-pound slab of meat.

240
00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:02,915
Oh, shoot.

241
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,402
I didn't pack my dress shoes.

242
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:06,034
See, George? It might be helpful

243
00:09:06,037 --> 00:09:08,112
if you mentioned some of
these things ahead of time.

244
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:11,139
- Here we go.
- Wayne's always doing stuff like this.

245
00:09:11,142 --> 00:09:12,917
I'm glad to know it's not just us.

246
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,181
That's why I packed
his shoes last night.

247
00:09:15,184 --> 00:09:18,636
You did? Baby, you're the best.

248
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,964
Well, how can I be
the best when you are?

249
00:09:21,969 --> 00:09:23,536
It is just us.

250
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,652
So, how does this work?

251
00:09:26,655 --> 00:09:28,568
You start by creating your character.

252
00:09:28,571 --> 00:09:31,347
I want to be a Ninja
Turtle Princess of Power.

253
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,566
Put me down for that, too.

254
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:35,808
You have to choose from one
of the character classes.

255
00:09:35,811 --> 00:09:37,933
There's thief, druid, paladin, wizard...

256
00:09:37,936 --> 00:09:40,550
- Ooh, wizard. I want that.
- All right.

257
00:09:40,553 --> 00:09:41,987
Then I'll use my magic to turn me

258
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,164
into a Ninja Turtle Princess of Power.

259
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,284
No.

260
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:47,461
W-Wh... Wait a minute. What's a paladin?

261
00:09:47,464 --> 00:09:50,605
A paladin is a holy knight who
crusades in the name of good.

262
00:09:50,608 --> 00:09:52,042
Oh, I like that.

263
00:09:52,045 --> 00:09:53,393
I want to be that.

264
00:09:53,396 --> 00:09:55,662
- Really?
- Yeah, I've been meaning

265
00:09:55,665 --> 00:09:57,972
to do more crusading
in the name of good.

266
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:00,495
Okay.

267
00:10:00,498 --> 00:10:02,759
You say you got thief on that list?

268
00:10:02,762 --> 00:10:04,050
I'll be a thief.

269
00:10:05,043 --> 00:10:07,019
That sounds like fun.

270
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,328
Okay, I think I got it.

271
00:10:09,331 --> 00:10:11,230
It takes ten minutes for the results.

272
00:10:11,233 --> 00:10:12,537
You want me to go in with you?

273
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,800
To watch me pee on a stick?

274
00:10:13,803 --> 00:10:15,020
I'm being supportive right now.

275
00:10:15,022 --> 00:10:16,292
You could try the same.

276
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,656
I'm pregnant. You
sure I'm not too heavy?

277
00:10:32,658 --> 00:10:34,051
No, I got it.

278
00:10:35,585 --> 00:10:37,501
I guess it's time to do what people do

279
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:38,634
on their wedding night.

280
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:40,682
Georgie, we're gonna be parents.

281
00:10:40,685 --> 00:10:41,858
We don't do that anymore.

282
00:10:41,861 --> 00:10:43,493
Oh, right.

283
00:10:43,495 --> 00:10:46,423
Besides, my water just
broke all over your bed.

284
00:10:46,426 --> 00:10:47,773
Dadgum it.

285
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,575
Stop having fun, and help
me take care of these babies.

286
00:10:51,578 --> 00:10:54,100
But I just got home from my day job.

287
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:56,087
And I only have ten
minutes till my night job.

288
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,659
That's ten minutes you could be helping.

289
00:10:57,661 --> 00:10:59,922
Now go change whichever this one is.

290
00:11:02,123 --> 00:11:03,142
Georgie,

291
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:06,124
there's a band called
Guns N' Roses on the phone.

292
00:11:06,127 --> 00:11:07,673
Really?

293
00:11:07,676 --> 00:11:09,997
Yeah. The guitarist hurt his hand,

294
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,741
and they want you to fill in.

295
00:11:14,296 --> 00:11:16,775
Tell them I can't. I'm a dad now.

296
00:11:16,778 --> 00:11:18,257
Okay.

297
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:23,326
This is a long ten minutes.

298
00:11:29,948 --> 00:11:32,503
Ooh, this camper is so cool.

299
00:11:32,506 --> 00:11:34,729
We borrowed it from my mom's boyfriend.

300
00:11:34,732 --> 00:11:37,080
Yeah, you might not want
to poke around too much.

301
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,839
You find my mother-in-law's bra,
I'm driving into a brick wall.

302
00:11:40,936 --> 00:11:42,263
Maybe we get one of these.

303
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:43,371
Spend our summers

304
00:11:43,374 --> 00:11:44,972
driving around, just the two of us.

305
00:11:44,975 --> 00:11:47,690
That sounds amazing.
Where would we go first?

306
00:11:47,693 --> 00:11:48,731
Does it even matter?

307
00:11:48,732 --> 00:11:50,706
We don't even have to
take it out the driveway.

308
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,753
You got that right.

309
00:11:52,756 --> 00:11:55,148
- Can you guys not do that?
- Do what?

310
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:58,154
Be so happy. You're
married. Act like it.

311
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,717
How do you put up with him?

312
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:04,222
That's a good question.
What's your secret?

313
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:06,616
Communication.

314
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:08,089
Oh, God.

315
00:12:13,046 --> 00:12:15,556
- Well?
- I'm not.

316
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:18,299
- Really?
- We're good.

317
00:12:18,301 --> 00:12:20,216
Oh, thank God.

318
00:12:23,532 --> 00:12:26,306
- What a relief.
- I know.

319
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:28,128
We better stop hugging,

320
00:12:28,131 --> 00:12:30,506
or you're gonna need
another stick to pee on.

321
00:12:31,232 --> 00:12:33,798
You enter a dark and musty crypt.

322
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:36,316
Torches along the walls fill the room

323
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:37,894
with a flickering light.

324
00:12:37,897 --> 00:12:41,440
In the center of the room is
a mysterious glowing chest.

325
00:12:41,443 --> 00:12:42,784
What do you do?

326
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:44,003
I open the chest.

327
00:12:44,006 --> 00:12:45,934
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

328
00:12:45,937 --> 00:12:47,979
It's a chest in the middle of a crypt.

329
00:12:47,982 --> 00:12:49,804
That's a little
suspicious, don't you think?

330
00:12:49,807 --> 00:12:52,375
I don't know. I'm not
even sure what a crypt is.

331
00:12:52,378 --> 00:12:53,526
Aah!

332
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:55,190
It could be booby-trapped.

333
00:12:55,193 --> 00:12:58,020
Thieves have the
ability to check for traps.

334
00:12:58,023 --> 00:12:59,925
Good for me, I can do that.

335
00:12:59,928 --> 00:13:04,082
Hold it. This chest
does not belong to us.

336
00:13:04,085 --> 00:13:05,878
So?

337
00:13:05,881 --> 00:13:07,503
I'm a paladin.

338
00:13:07,506 --> 00:13:10,933
It's not a very... paladin-y thing to do.

339
00:13:10,936 --> 00:13:12,544
You didn't want to steal the key,

340
00:13:12,547 --> 00:13:14,136
You didn't want to fight the goblins.

341
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:15,972
You wouldn't even kill the spider.

342
00:13:15,975 --> 00:13:18,261
You put it in a cup and took it outside.

343
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:19,487
Well, that wasn't in the game.

344
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,683
I know.

345
00:13:20,686 --> 00:13:23,493
It was in real life, which is worse.

346
00:13:23,496 --> 00:13:26,823
Could me and your meemaw
have a little privacy, please?

347
00:13:26,826 --> 00:13:29,066
We can leave,
but we're still gonna listen.

348
00:13:29,068 --> 00:13:30,815
Also, you find no traps.

349
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,698
What is your problem?

350
00:13:34,701 --> 00:13:36,570
You act like Mr. Goody Two-shoes,

351
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:38,628
and you expect meto believe that's real?

352
00:13:38,631 --> 00:13:40,859
- Yeah.
- Well, I don't.

353
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,253
Sheldon said there were no traps.

354
00:13:44,662 --> 00:13:47,228
Now, I know it's hokey,
but at least once a day,

355
00:13:47,231 --> 00:13:50,972
Darlene and I say one thing that
we appreciate about each other.

356
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,972
Isn't that sweet?

357
00:13:52,975 --> 00:13:54,503
It was Wayne's idea.

358
00:13:54,506 --> 00:13:56,761
I appreciate you saying that.

359
00:13:56,764 --> 00:13:58,139
And I'm gonna vomit.

360
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,576
It's fine.

361
00:14:01,578 --> 00:14:03,404
We-we know we appreciate each other.

362
00:14:03,406 --> 00:14:06,145
Mary, is it fine?

363
00:14:06,147 --> 00:14:08,558
I guess it wouldn't hurt

364
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:10,411
to hear it once in a while.

365
00:14:10,413 --> 00:14:12,456
George?

366
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,753
What? Now?

367
00:14:14,756 --> 00:14:16,147
You got something better to do?

368
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,487
Come on, George.

369
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,881
This is ridiculous.

370
00:14:18,884 --> 00:14:20,479
Just do it, you baby.

371
00:14:23,382 --> 00:14:27,097
Fine. Mary, I appreciate you.

372
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,921
That's the best you can do?

373
00:14:28,924 --> 00:14:32,784
Baby, you have any single
friends for this poor woman?

374
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,104
Mary, I appreciate how much
you take care of the house

375
00:14:39,107 --> 00:14:42,238
and... all of us.

376
00:14:42,241 --> 00:14:44,417
I know it's not easy.

377
00:14:46,506 --> 00:14:49,261
Thank you. That means a lot.

378
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,433
I love it. Mary, you're up.

379
00:14:54,381 --> 00:14:56,300
Well, George...

380
00:14:58,461 --> 00:15:02,019
I appreciate how hard you work.

381
00:15:02,022 --> 00:15:05,253
I know you make a lot
of sacrifices for us,

382
00:15:05,256 --> 00:15:08,041
and you don't get
enough credit for that.

383
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:14,222
Thank you.

384
00:15:19,324 --> 00:15:21,276
Now, let's hear how
much you appreciate me

385
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,062
for fixing your marriage.

386
00:15:23,065 --> 00:15:25,023
Shut up, Wayne.

387
00:15:27,114 --> 00:15:29,097
I wonder who came up
with blue raspberry.

388
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,495
Raspberries ain't blue.

389
00:15:30,498 --> 00:15:33,064
- It should be blueberry.
- You'd think.

390
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:36,620
But blueberries ain't blue
either, they're purple.

391
00:15:36,623 --> 00:15:39,940
The whole blue food situation
in this country needs some work.

392
00:15:41,826 --> 00:15:43,173
So, what do you want to do?

393
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,487
Probably something with our clothes on.

394
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,331
No kidding. That was scary.

395
00:15:47,334 --> 00:15:48,745
- Terrifying.
- I was afraid

396
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,472
I was gonna have to marry you.

397
00:15:50,475 --> 00:15:51,691
Afraid?

398
00:15:51,694 --> 00:15:53,564
Shaking in my boots.

399
00:15:53,567 --> 00:15:55,519
And what, exactly, would be so terrible

400
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:57,342
about marrying me?

401
00:15:57,345 --> 00:16:00,026
I didn't say terrible.

402
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:02,128
You can be afraid of
things that are great.

403
00:16:02,131 --> 00:16:03,827
Like what?

404
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,026
Uh...

405
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:08,291
Oh, roller coasters.

406
00:16:08,294 --> 00:16:09,979
You're an idiot.

407
00:16:09,982 --> 00:16:12,156
Roller coasters is a good answer.

408
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:14,901
I didn't say sharks, which
is what I thought of first.

409
00:16:14,904 --> 00:16:16,338
You're making it worse.

410
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:18,167
How is I worse? I didn't say it.

411
00:16:19,715 --> 00:16:21,846
Roller coasters is a good answer.

412
00:16:21,849 --> 00:16:24,893
What happened to you?
You used to be fun.

413
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:26,519
Come on, I'm playing this stupid game

414
00:16:26,522 --> 00:16:28,479
- with your grandkids.
- That's rude.

415
00:16:28,482 --> 00:16:30,925
Cut the crap. We both
know this isn't you.

416
00:16:30,928 --> 00:16:32,449
Oh, I can't win with you.

417
00:16:32,452 --> 00:16:34,206
- What does that mean?
- Forget it.

418
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:36,276
No, I'm not gonna forget it. Talk to me.

419
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:38,659
- I don't want to.
- Missy, help me out here.

420
00:16:38,662 --> 00:16:40,401
Communication is important.

421
00:16:40,404 --> 00:16:42,706
- I learned that on the Fresh Princeshow.
- Oh...

422
00:16:45,241 --> 00:16:48,611
I asked you to marry me
and you turned me down flat.

423
00:16:48,614 --> 00:16:50,269
Are you still mad about that?

424
00:16:50,272 --> 00:16:52,351
Oh, hell yeah I'm still mad about that.

425
00:16:52,354 --> 00:16:53,500
He proposed?

426
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,445
He just said he did. Pay attention.

427
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,100
And you didn't even take it seriously.

428
00:16:58,102 --> 00:17:00,842
I didn't take it seriously
because you were drunk.

429
00:17:00,844 --> 00:17:02,406
That's when I'm the most honest.

430
00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:04,280
You can ask anybody at the bar.

431
00:17:04,282 --> 00:17:06,523
Okay, fine. That still
doesn't change the fact

432
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,732
that I'm not interested

433
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,508
- in getting married again.
- Why not?

434
00:17:09,511 --> 00:17:11,809
I don't have to explain myself to you.

435
00:17:11,811 --> 00:17:14,339
- I'd like to know.
- And I'd like to play D&D.

436
00:17:14,342 --> 00:17:16,383
We've been through this.

437
00:17:16,386 --> 00:17:18,555
I like my life just the way it is,

438
00:17:18,557 --> 00:17:22,150
and if you can't work
with that, then, well...

439
00:17:22,153 --> 00:17:23,979
Well what?

440
00:17:23,982 --> 00:17:26,417
Tough knuckles.

441
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,898
Whoa.

442
00:17:27,901 --> 00:17:29,740
Huh.

443
00:17:29,742 --> 00:17:31,307
Well, that's good, then.

444
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:32,787
I don't have to pretend to be

445
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:35,311
mister water-drinking nice guy anymore.

446
00:17:35,313 --> 00:17:37,703
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

447
00:17:37,706 --> 00:17:41,012
Yeah, well.

448
00:17:41,014 --> 00:17:43,198
Will you all excuse me?

449
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,843
Where you going?

450
00:17:45,845 --> 00:17:49,325
I'm gonna get myself a beer.

451
00:17:49,327 --> 00:17:52,467
So you're standing in a crypt
looking at a locked chest.

452
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,711
What do you do?

453
00:17:53,714 --> 00:17:55,411
Pull a beer out of it.

454
00:17:59,397 --> 00:18:01,702
Get out of my way.

455
00:18:01,704 --> 00:18:05,053
I'm a thief, and I'm opening this chest.

456
00:18:05,055 --> 00:18:08,027
Have at it. I'm a
paladin with a buzz on.

457
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,018
Success.

458
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,889
The chest opens, revealing a scroll

459
00:18:14,891 --> 00:18:17,109
with ancient writing
in a strange language

460
00:18:17,111 --> 00:18:19,285
you don't recognize. What do you do?

461
00:18:19,287 --> 00:18:21,243
I say this is boring...

462
00:18:21,245 --> 00:18:24,161
and turn myself into a Ninja
Turtle Princess of Power.

463
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:30,600
This game just got good.

464
00:18:30,602 --> 00:18:32,167
- High five.
- Yeah.

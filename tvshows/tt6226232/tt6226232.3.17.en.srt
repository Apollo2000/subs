Young Sheldon:

00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,590
I love you.

3
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:11,679
- Veronica.
- Hey, Georgie. What's up?

4
00:00:11,763 --> 00:00:14,307
- We're friends, right?
- What do you mean?

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,102
I've asked you out a bunch and you've
made it pretty clear you weren't interested.

6
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:21,606
Before I asked out another girl,
I wanted to make sure...

7
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:22,690
It's fine.

8
00:00:23,942 --> 00:00:25,568
Guess I'll see you around.

9
00:00:27,362 --> 00:00:28,404
Yep.

15
00:00:56,391 --> 00:00:59,852
Hello? Anyone there?

16
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:02,480
That's okay. I'll wait.

17
00:01:02,564 --> 00:01:06,192
<i>And one time,

18
00:01:06,276 --> 00:01:08,653
<i>I stayed longer than everyone.</i>

19
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:11,197
- Where are you all going?
- Professor's not here.

20
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:13,283
I can teach the class.

21
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,954
I just need a box to stand on.

Dr. Sturgis?

24
00:01:22,542 --> 00:01:24,961
Hello, Sheldon. What brings you here?

25
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:27,714
- You never showed up to class.
- Whoops!

26
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:30,133
Time flies when you're having fun.

27
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:32,677
What could be more fun
than giving a physics lecture?

28
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,555
Finishing a physics paper.

29
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:37,390
Ooh. I like where this is headed.

30
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:42,812
I'm exploring the notion
that time itself is quantized.

31
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:44,063
Interesting.

32
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:46,941
That sounds like a step
towards a unified field theory.

33
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:48,901
Fingers crossed.

34
00:01:48,985 --> 00:01:51,946
Although I can't cross my fingers.

35
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,197
Arthritis.

36
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,415
It's too dark back here.
Do you have a flashlight?

37
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:04,375
In the glove box, I think.

38
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:07,253
- Can you pass it back?
- No. I'm driving.

39
00:02:07,337 --> 00:02:09,339
All right. I'm coming up.

40
00:02:09,422 --> 00:02:11,758
Don't crash while I'm unbuckled.

41
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:14,052
Really? You need to do this right now?

42
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:18,640
It's Dr. Sturgis' first paper in years.
It's worth risking head trauma.

43
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:22,226
Look at you, climbing like a real boy.

44
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,686

- I'll wait for the movie.

47
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:33,279
He's opening with a critical examination

48
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:36,240
of the Copenhagen interpretation
of quantum mechanics.

49
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:38,368
I thought reading in the car
made you nauseous.

50
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:41,287
That's in the back seat. Up here I'm fine.

51
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:47,919

- Sorry.

60
00:03:15,406 --> 00:03:19,450
Team meeting with the baseball moms.

<i>Look at this.

63

I brought veggies and ranch.

64
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:32,296
That's nice but when I said "snacks,"
I mean wine.

65
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,090
- Oh.
- Don't worry.

66
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:36,968
I got plenty of emergency snacks.

67
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,553
All right, let's get to this.

68
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:41,139
We're coming up on the end of the season.

69
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:44,183
- Who wants to handle the team cookout?
- Got it.

70
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:45,893
Thank you, Meredith. Team picture day?

71
00:03:45,977 --> 00:03:47,603
- That's me.
- Carla, you're a gem.

72
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:50,481
Mary, that leaves you in charge of trophies.
Any questions?

73
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:52,608
- Actually...
- Snack time!

74
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:56,529
There's also veggies.

75
00:03:58,114 --> 00:03:59,365
This is nice.

76
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:03,119
I like to think of Chi-Chi's
as a more romantic Taco Bell.

77
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,252
So, what do you like to get here?

78
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:14,422
What? It doesn't matter.
It all tastes the same.

79
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,049
Hi. Welcome to...

80
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:21,012
- Oh. Hey, Georgie.
- Hi.

81
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:27,268
- I didn't know you worked here.
- Well, haven't seen you in a while.

82
00:04:28,144 --> 00:04:31,647
- Oh! You know Jana from school?
- Yeah. Yeah, of course.

83
00:04:31,731 --> 00:04:33,775
- Hi.
- Hi.

84
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,737
So can I get y'all started
with some drinks?

85
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,281
I'm good with water.

86
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:42,575
Water sounds great. Refreshing.

87
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:47,538
I'm glad Dr. Sturgis let me read his paper
before he published.

88
00:04:48,164 --> 00:04:49,122
Why is that?

89
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:51,167
He's getting numbers
for the massive neutrinos

90
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,003
that are in excess
of a hundred giga-electron volts.

91
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:57,256
- Well, good for him.
- No, it's embarrassing.

92
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,758
Had a 50-50 shot.

93
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:02,178
I guess I need to call and let him know
what a bonehead mistake he made.

94
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:05,765
There's probably a nicer way to say it.

95
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:08,226
Did you hear
how massive his neutrinos were?

96
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:10,186
We're well into bonehead territory.

97
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,146
Sheldon, you don't need
to be rude to him.

98
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,648
When am I rude?

99
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:19,529
Stay a child as long as you can.
Adulthood will not be kind to you.

100
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,243
Neat. The veins on your calf
look like a road map of Texas.

101
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:30,540
Did you make this taste bad
so Dad would lose weight?

102
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,253
Fine. I'll be polite.

103
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:39,549
But I still think we could go
to San Antonio using Meemaw's leg.

104
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:42,467
Hello?

105
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:46,138
Dr. Sturgis. It's Sheldon.
I hope you're well.

106
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:48,641
I am. I just had soup.

107
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:51,853
Anyway, I was just calling
to let you know I read your paper.

108
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:54,522
Wonderful.
What did you think?

109
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:59,902
I thought your typing was very tidy.
Your sentence structure was impressive.

110
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:05,324
And your theory was not without
succeeding in avoiding success.

111
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:09,662
Well, Sheldon, you don't need
to beat around the bush.

112
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:13,249
We're men of science.
Just give it to me straight.

113
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:16,210
The masses for your neutrinos
are impossible.

114
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:18,379
Are you sure?

115
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:21,382
Yes. If they were that heavy,
atoms could not beta decay.

116
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:26,345
I don't know how I missed that.
I'm such an idiot.

117
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:29,056
You're not an idiot.
You're just a bonehead.

118
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:36,981
So you're saying you have no feelings
for her at all?

119
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,609
I wasn't at the restaurant with her,
I was there with you.

120
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:41,360
That doesn't answer my question!

121
00:06:41,444 --> 00:06:43,571
I was hoping you wouldn't
pick up on that.

122
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:47,325
Did you take me there on purpose?

123
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:49,285
Hold on a second.
Is this one of those fights

124
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:51,162
where we end up making out
in the back seat?

125
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:54,332
- No.
- That's too bad.

128
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:08,095
Morning. I need to order
some baseball trophies.

129
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:09,847
Baseball's over there.

130
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:16,270
So many choices.

131
00:07:16,354 --> 00:07:18,022
Mm-hm.

132
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:22,318
You should win a trophy
for the most trophies.

133
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,195
Mm. Ahem.

134
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:28,950
Maybe not the trophy for customer service.

135
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:31,035
Is this everything you have?

136
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,870
Impressive, isn't it?

137
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:36,374
I noticed that there are no baseball trophies
with girls on them.

138
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:38,125
Girls don't play baseball.

139
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:40,002
Actually, my daughter does.

140
00:07:40,086 --> 00:07:42,630
Oh. Good for her.

141
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:46,509
And some of the girls might like a trophy
with a girl on it.

142
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:48,886
Well, then they'll be very disappointed.

143
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:51,764
You know what?

144
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:55,017
- I'm gonna take my business elsewhere.
- Oh, no.

145
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:59,438
And you should win a trophy
for being such a sourpuss!

146
00:08:00,773 --> 00:08:02,400
Ta-ta!

147
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:05,820
- Hello?
<i>- Dr. Sturgis.</i>

148
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:08,322
It's Sheldon.
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

149
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:12,493
Nah, just wondering
what became of my career.

150
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:13,828
Should I call you back later?

151
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:18,124
Oh, no. I can be downtrodden
and chat at the same time. What's up?

152
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,543
I was thinking about
the mass problem of your neutrinos,

153
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:25,047
and I realized we might be able to solve it
if some of the particles have more spin.

154
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:26,507
Interesting.

155
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,885
That would certainly get
our neutrino mass to zero.

156
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:35,725
Although it does open up a problem
with double beta decay.

157
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:38,102
Hm. That is true.

158
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:42,189
Unless what it's actually predicting
is a magnetic monopole.

159
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:45,901
Might be difficult
to control the infinities.

160
00:08:45,985 --> 00:08:47,194
Although,

161
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,825
if you consider adding
faster-than-light particles like tachyons,

162
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,410
then I suppose you could...

163
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,996
- Quantize time.
<i>- Yes!</i>

164
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:00,332
Hang on! If we're gonna
be thinking at this level,

165
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,835
I should put on pants!

166
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:06,547
Can you believe this?

167
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,967
Boy trophy, boy trophy, boy trophy.

168
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:12,803
All I see is my trophy wife.

169
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:14,013
Nope? Okay.

170
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:18,726
Look, the only girl trophies
are for cheerleading, soccer and golf.

171
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:22,188
So buy Missy a golf trophy
and tell her it's a skinny bat.

172
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:23,898
George.

173
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,776
That poor girl has been
watching her brother win awards

174
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:29,153
since he was 3 years old.

175
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,864
I'd like for her first one to be special.

176
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,450
Because you think
it may also be her last one?

177
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:37,369
- I didn't say that.
- But you thought it.

178
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:39,872
Yeah.

179
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,003
Hey. Here you go.

180
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,340
- What's this?
- It's your tip from the other night.

181
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:54,428
I wanted to give it to you then
but I also wanted to get out of there alive.

182
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:55,763
Don't worry about it.

183
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:58,265
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

184
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:01,560
So how long you been working there?

185
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:03,979
Couple weeks.
Trying to save money for college.

186
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:06,690
Well, now you have to take this. I insist.

187
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,153
Thank you. How are things with Jana?

188
00:10:11,237 --> 00:10:14,073
Honestly, I have no idea.

189
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:16,158
Should you even be talking to me
right now?

190
00:10:16,242 --> 00:10:18,536
- Probably not.
- Heh.

191
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:21,539
But I'm glad I am.

192
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,751
Me too.

193
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:29,797
Bye.

194
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:35,678
I'd like to end today's lecture
with a hilarious physics joke.

195
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:39,557
Why didn't the photon pack a suitcase?

196
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,810
He was traveling light.

197
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,021
- Sheldon?
- Ha, ha.

198
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:47,690
Thank you.

199
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,608
Class dismissed.

200
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:55,114
Well, our conversation about my paper

201
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:58,784
resulted in a very productive
couple of days.

202
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:03,080
I completely rewrote
the whole thing from scratch.

203
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:06,292
Exciting. I know credits
are usually listed alphabetically,

204
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,795
but I'm completely fine
with my name going second.

205
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:13,090
Sheldon, I've worked
on this paper for years.

206
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:16,051
I'm not putting your name on it at all.

207
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:17,970
- But I helped you.
- You did.

208
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,973
But you didn't cowrite the paper with me.

209
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:24,727
- Is that so?
- Yes, it is.

210
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,228
Well, this is an outrage.

211
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:29,023
After all the help I've given you
and I don't even get credit?

212
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:31,692
Well, of course you are.

213
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:34,486
You're getting a special thanks
in the footnotes.

214
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,989
- No one reads the footnotes.
- I do.

215
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,491
Well, I do too but that doesn't mean
I want to be in them.

216
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:43,746
Sheldon, that's where people
get recognition for helping.

217
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,623
You mean the help of using my math

218
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:49,668
to convert your hazy series of meanderings
into a well-formed scientific thesis?

219
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:52,421
I think you're overstating
your contribution.

220
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,673
Well, I think you should
be wearing a black ski mask

221
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:57,176
because you're trying to rob me blind.

222
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:00,638
Well, if anyone should be wearing
an odd piece of apparel,

223
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:03,307
it should be you wearing a baby bonnet

224
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,392
because that's how you're behaving.

225
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,771
- Ready to go?
- Very!

226
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:13,442
It's a good thing she showed up
because I do not have a comeback.

227
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:22,576
Darn it. When he called me a baby,
I should've said:

228
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,287
"Then I guess you needed
a baby's help to fix your paper."

229
00:12:25,371 --> 00:12:26,789
Very clever.

230
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:28,707
Turn the car around.

231
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:32,169
We're halfway home. It's not that clever.

232
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:34,046
Why aren't you being
more supportive of me?

233
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:37,299
Sheldon, John is a lot of things
but he's not a thief.

234
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:39,760
- So you're on his side.
- I'm not.

235
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:43,847
- So you're on my side.
- For the sake of this car ride, sure.

236
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:47,226
Okay, here's the plan.

237
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:49,353
End your relationship
with Coach Ballard,

238
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:53,065
date Dr. Sturgis again,
get him to love you more than ever,

239
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:54,608
then when he least expects it,

240
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:57,653
break his heart and say,
"That's for Sheldon."

241
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:58,904
Great plan.

242
00:12:58,988 --> 00:13:00,072
You think so?

243
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:03,784
For the sake of this car ride, sure.

244
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:07,413
So shiny, aren't you, now?

245
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:10,374
Hello. Remember me?

246
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,835
I thought you were gonna take
your business elsewhere.

247
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:15,838
Well, lucky for you,
I believe in second chances.

248
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,673
Mm.

249
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:22,970
Now, I know that you don't have
girl baseball trophies in stock

250
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:25,806
but could you have one made special?

251
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,017
- Sure.
- Great.

252
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,021
A custom mold is 50 bucks
and it takes six weeks.

253
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:36,984
I'm not paying you $50 for a trophy.
And I don't have six weeks.

254
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:41,155
Well, does your daughter look like a horse?
Maybe she'd like this.

255
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:49,163
I knew all that God talk
was covering something really evil.

256
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:54,626
I am trying to make
a special trophy for Missy.

257
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,713
So I'm gonna take this head
and put it on that body.

258
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:01,342
Whatever you say, Dr. Frankenstein.

259
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:05,220
My daughter deserves to have a trophy
that looks something like her.

260
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:08,724
So this is kind of a feminist gesture
on your part.

261
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:11,852
I prefer to think of it
as a maternal gesture.

262
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:15,439
Let's just split the difference
and call it the stuff of nightmares.

263
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:20,027
- It'll look better when I paint it.
- I don't think so.

264
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,994
- Grant Linkletter.
<i>- Dr. Linkletter, Sheldon Cooper.</i>

265
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:31,413
I need your help reporting
an academic crime.

266
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:33,582
- Sounds serious.
<i>- It is.</i>

267
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:37,294
- That's why I'm using my serious voice.
<i>- Then I'll use mine as well.</i>

268
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:38,670
What's going on?

269
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:42,800
Dr. Sturgis has stolen my work
and is using it in his own paper.

270
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:46,887
- Well, that's quite the allegation.
<i>- It's not an allegation; it's a fact.</i>

271
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,680
He was getting enormous masses

272
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:50,891
for his neutrinos
and I showed him how to fix it

273
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:53,268
but now he's refusing
to list me as a coauthor.

274
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:55,270
Well, I think he has a point.

275
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:57,147
Is the "he" in that sentence me?

276
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:59,191
Because that is a strange way to phrase it.

277
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:02,194
<i>No, the "he" is him.
I don't play games with sentence structure.</i>

278
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:04,655
Look, I haven't done
a forensic examination of this paper

279
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:08,283
but it's not uncommon to show your work
to a colleague to get their feedback.

280
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:10,119
But I fixed his paper.

281
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:12,871
This kind of accusation
could have real consequences.

282
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,499
I'd consider my next steps very carefully.

283
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:18,127
You're no help.
Put me through to your supervisor.

284
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,838
Please let me speak to John
before you take this any further.

285
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:24,508
All right, but if he calls me a baby,
feel free to say:

286
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,803
"Then I guess you needed a baby
to fix your paper."

287
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:30,806
That's a good one
but I'm not gonna say it.

288
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:36,228
I bet the guy who invented the spork
is a millionaire.

289
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:37,311
I guess.

290
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:39,231
I wonder if his last name is Spork.

291
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:43,610
It comes from "spoon"
and "fork." Spork.

292
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:45,988
Oh, my God. Mind is blown.

293
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:58,542
You know what you should do?
Cut your hair.

294
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,086
- What?
- I think it'd look better.

295
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,839
Maybe a little beard like George Michael.

296
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:06,216
I wonder how tall he is. I bet he's tall.

297
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:14,766
Hey. I have something to show you.

298
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,393
What's up?

299
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:19,855
I was gonna give this to you
at the end of the season party

300
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:25,110
but I was so excited
that I wanted you to see it now.

301
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:28,530
What the hell is that?

302
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:32,618
I couldn't find any girl baseball trophies
so I made you one.

303
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:34,077
Why is her head so big?

304
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,914
It's a Barbie head. I had to improvise.

305
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:39,208
You chopped the head off
one of my Barbies?

306
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:43,003
- Don't be silly. I bought a new one.
- I could've had a new Barbie?

307
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:48,550
The point is you deserve
to be recognized appropriately

308
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:51,011
for everything you've accomplished.

309
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:53,180
You can't give that to me
in front of the boys.

310
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:56,266
- Why?
- It's embarrassing.

311
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,227
Well, we have plenty of time.

312
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:04,775
I can make the head smaller or the body
bigger or a little bit of both.

313
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,819
I just want the same trophy
everyone else gets.

314
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:09,863
But I want you to feel special.

315
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:12,491
And I just want to feel regular.

316
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:16,328
Okay.

317
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:17,996
Well...

318
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:22,125
I'll make sure you get
a regular one at the party.

319
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:23,502
Thank you.

320
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:28,632
Mom, wait.

321
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:33,971
I get what you were trying to do.

322
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:36,682
It's nice.

323
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,518
Thanks.

324
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,186
Can I keep that one too?

325
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,690
You really want it?

326
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,275
I do.

327
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:58,412
<i>Despite her many flaws,
my sister did have a soft spot in her heart.</i>

328
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:01,832
<i>And a fondness for blowing things up.</i>

329
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:15,220
What was that?

330
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:31,737
- Hello?
- How dare you accuse me of plagiarism?

331
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,739
<i>And to my colleague, no less.</i>

332
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:37,284
This is my reputation you're jeopardizing.

333
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:40,787
Well, give me the credit I deserve
and I'll stop.

334
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:41,997
We've been over this.

335
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,124
You made a helpful suggestion

336
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:49,504
and then you arrogantly assumed
that it entitled you to a coauthor credit,

337
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:50,964
which it doesn't.

338
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:52,257
But I was the one who...

339
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:54,926
I've been your friend and mentor.

340
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,512
The idea that I would steal from you

341
00:18:57,596 --> 00:19:02,100
is both personally
and professionally insulting.

342
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:05,103
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way but...

343
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:09,232
Sheldon, I don't want
to see you in my class anymore.

343
00:19:10,305 --> 00:20:10,901

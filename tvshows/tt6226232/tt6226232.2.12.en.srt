1
00:00:02,176 --> 00:00:04,308
Now, can anyone tell me

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:07,137
why Melville shifts
the narrative voice

3
00:00:07,181 --> 00:00:09,748
from Ishmael to Ahab?

4
00:00:17,887 --> 00:00:18,757
Sheldon.

5
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:19,976
I have a tummyache.

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,630
I'd like to see the nurse.

7
00:00:21,673 --> 00:00:22,979
A "tummyache"?

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:26,243
Yes, Derek,
I have a tummy and it aches.

9
00:00:26,287 --> 00:00:27,897
Ergo, tummyache.

10
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:28,854
Ergo?

11
00:00:28,898 --> 00:00:30,247
It's Latin, Derek.

12
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,901
Go to the nurse.

13
00:00:31,944 --> 00:00:34,469
And to answer your question,

14
00:00:34,512 --> 00:00:35,818
the shifting point of view

15
00:00:35,861 --> 00:00:37,385
grants the reader
a broader perspective

16
00:00:37,428 --> 00:00:40,388
of events than typically allowed
by first-person narration.

17
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:43,391
Where were we?

18
00:00:43,434 --> 00:00:47,090
And "ergo" is Latin for "hence,"
Derek.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

20
00:01:08,155 --> 00:01:09,504
Hello, Nora.

21
00:01:09,547 --> 00:01:13,856
Hey, there's
my favorite patient!

22
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:16,076
What hurts today?

23
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:17,207
Tummy troubles.

24
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:18,817
No. Sorry to hear it.

25
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:21,037
Let me grab your file.

26
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,623
 Throughout
my high school career,

27
00:01:22,647 --> 00:01:24,475
Nurse Nora and I

28
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:26,956
had been through quite a few
close calls...

29
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:28,827
This is just a blister.

30
00:01:28,871 --> 00:01:30,090
Are you sure?

31
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:33,093
Sheldon, I promise
you don't have leprosy.

32
00:01:33,136 --> 00:01:35,138
Ooh, that's bright.

33
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:37,880
Proving you don't have
hysterical blindness.

34
00:01:37,923 --> 00:01:39,708
Well, can you test
for just hysterical?

35
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:42,972
Looks like you bit your cheek.

36
00:01:43,015 --> 00:01:45,496
How do you know it's not scurvy?

37
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,107
Because you're not a pirate.

38
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,457
So, we've got a tummyache?

39
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,155
Yes. I'm afraid
it might be cholera.

40
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:53,330
Again?

41
00:01:53,374 --> 00:01:55,376
I have one of the symptoms.

42
00:01:55,419 --> 00:01:58,161
Okay, on a scale of one to ten,
what's your pain level?

43
00:01:58,205 --> 00:02:00,120
Three...

44
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:02,383
point four seven.

45
00:02:02,426 --> 00:02:03,732
That's pretty serious.

46
00:02:03,775 --> 00:02:07,910
But since you're at a 3.47,

47
00:02:07,953 --> 00:02:10,260
I'm gonna give you
the strongest medication

48
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,394
I'm allowed to give you.

49
00:02:13,437 --> 00:02:15,918
You're an angel
of mercy, Nurse Nora.

50
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:18,964
Ooh, cherry.

51
00:02:24,796 --> 00:02:26,146
Hello?

52
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:28,104
Hey, Nora.

53
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,150
What is it this time?

54
00:02:31,803 --> 00:02:33,892
Okay, yeah,
thanks for lettin' me know.

55
00:02:33,936 --> 00:02:36,721
I'll keep an eye on him.

56
00:02:36,765 --> 00:02:38,680
Sheldon back in
the nurse's office?

57
00:02:38,723 --> 00:02:39,594
Yep.

58
00:02:39,637 --> 00:02:41,030
Let me guess.

59
00:02:41,073 --> 00:02:43,119
Yellow fever. Dengue fever.

60
00:02:44,076 --> 00:02:45,469
Cat scratch fever.

61
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:47,123
Cholera.

62
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,299
Ooh! I was gonna say cholera.

63
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:52,781
A quadrilateral

64
00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:54,652
that can be inscribed
in a circle

65
00:02:54,696 --> 00:02:56,828
is an example of
a cyclic polygon.

66
00:02:58,482 --> 00:03:02,486
Sheldon, don't argue with me,
I'm looking at it right here.

67
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,706
While Nurse Nora's
special medicine

68
00:03:04,749 --> 00:03:06,795
had given me
a temporary reprieve,

69
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:09,928
my pain had escalated to a 4.9.

70
00:03:09,972 --> 00:03:11,297
Although Ms. Ingram's
questionable math skills

71
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:13,367
certainly weren't helping.

72
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,110
Sheldon, you okay?

73
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,029
You're gonna be fine.

74
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:26,293
One good dump
and you'll feel right as rain.

75
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,556
Can you please not call it that?

76
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,644
What, "dump"?

77
00:03:29,687 --> 00:03:30,819
Yes.

78
00:03:30,862 --> 00:03:31,950
You want me to say "poop"?

79
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:34,344
I want you to stop
talking about it.

80
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,913
Dad!

81
00:03:37,956 --> 00:03:39,654
Where is he?

82
00:03:39,697 --> 00:03:40,829
He's fine.

83
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:42,352
He's in the bathroom
workin' it out.

84
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:45,529
Shelly, you okay in there?

85
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:46,835
No.

86
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:48,271
Give it a few more minutes!

87
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:49,533
Eyes on the prize!

88
00:03:49,577 --> 00:03:52,144
This is not a fecal issue!

89
00:03:52,188 --> 00:03:53,755
I'm coming in.

90
00:03:53,798 --> 00:03:55,670
My tummy really hurts, Mom.

91
00:03:55,713 --> 00:03:57,106
You do feel a bit warm.

92
00:03:57,149 --> 00:03:58,890
Okay, you finish up in here,

93
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:00,607
get in bed, and I'll
bring you some ginger ale.

94
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:02,154
Canada Dry?

95
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:04,069
Yes. Room temperature?

96
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:05,245
Yes.

97
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:06,333
Mostly flat?

98
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:08,030
I'll stir the fizz out
with a spoon.

99
00:04:08,073 --> 00:04:09,161
Thanks, Mom.

100
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,489
Why don't you dote
on me like that?

101
00:04:12,513 --> 00:04:14,515
Because he's my baby.

102
00:04:14,558 --> 00:04:16,299
Well, I could be your baby.

103
00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:18,301
Now I have a stomachache.

104
00:04:21,086 --> 00:04:22,958
How you feelin', baby?

105
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:26,091
Remember the tuna sandwich
I had at the bus station?

106
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:27,092
Yeah?

107
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:28,529
Worse than that.

108
00:04:28,572 --> 00:04:31,358
Honey, I'm sorry.

109
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:33,534
I'm sure you'll feel
better in the morning.

110
00:04:33,577 --> 00:04:36,493
Hey, Mom, you know how twins
can feel each other's pain?

111
00:04:36,537 --> 00:04:38,190
You're going to school tomorrow.

112
00:04:38,234 --> 00:04:40,758
I think she's gettin' smarter.

113
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,852
Relax, he's sleeping.

114
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:50,202
How come when I'm sick
it's no big deal,

115
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:51,552
but when gets sick

116
00:04:51,595 --> 00:04:53,094
you act like
it's the end of the world?

117
00:04:53,118 --> 00:04:56,121
Because he's
a fragile little boy

118
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:58,602
and you're gettin' to be
a big, strong man.

119
00:04:58,646 --> 00:04:59,951
That's true.

120
00:04:59,995 --> 00:05:02,171
Puberty has done right by me.

121
00:05:03,607 --> 00:05:05,609
Mom? Something's really
wrong with.

122
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:12,442
We need a doctor here!

123
00:05:12,486 --> 00:05:14,290
 In that moment,
I was in too much pain

124
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,142
to tell my father,
"I told you so."

125
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:20,102
But for years after,
I reminded him constantly.

126
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:29,459
So how's he doing?

127
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:32,027
Aw, poor little guy.

128
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,073
All right, well,
if there's anything you need,

129
00:05:35,117 --> 00:05:36,858
let me know.

130
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:38,599
I love you, too.

131
00:05:38,642 --> 00:05:41,079
Well?

132
00:05:41,123 --> 00:05:43,038
Your brother's gonna be fine,

133
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:45,214
but he has to have
his gallbladder removed.

134
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:46,694
How's he gonna pee?

135
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:48,522
Not that bladder,
his gallbladder.

136
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:50,088
What's the gallbladder do?

137
00:05:50,132 --> 00:05:52,482
I guess not much,
if they're takin' it out.

138
00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:54,366
You think he'll bring it home
so we can see it?

139
00:05:56,051 --> 00:05:58,096
I'll ask.

140
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:06,801
I feel terrible.

141
00:06:06,844 --> 00:06:09,281
How was I supposed to know
it was his gallbladder?

142
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:11,893
The doctor says
it's rare in children.

143
00:06:11,936 --> 00:06:15,200
Well, he's always complaining
about some health issue

144
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:16,724
and it... it's usually nothin'.

145
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:18,378
I know, George.

146
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:20,641
I mean, how many times...

147
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:21,729
I'm prayin' here!

148
00:06:21,772 --> 00:06:23,818
Right, sorry. Sorry.

149
00:06:29,127 --> 00:06:31,739
So, those pain meds should
already be kicking in.

150
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:33,131
Then my buddy Gary here

151
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:35,569
is gonna administer the gas,
which'll help you sleep.

152
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:37,092
And once you're under,

153
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:38,199
we'll make a little incision

154
00:06:38,223 --> 00:06:40,269
and snatch that guy
right outta there.

155
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:41,444
Any questions?

156
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:42,837
Yes.

157
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,447
What kind of doctor says,

158
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:46,841
"Snatch that guy
right out of there?"

159
00:06:46,884 --> 00:06:48,451
Just trying to put you at ease.

160
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:49,844
It didn't work.

161
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:52,020
Where did you go
to medical school?

162
00:06:52,063 --> 00:06:53,456
University of Nebraska.

163
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:57,721
Did you at least graduate
with honors?

164
00:06:57,765 --> 00:06:58,809
Top of my class.

165
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:01,290
Have you had any alcohol

166
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,639
in the last 24 hours?

167
00:07:02,683 --> 00:07:03,814
Not a drop.

168
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:05,599
How much sleep
did you get last...

169
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:08,297
Gary, can we... Got it.

170
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,127
Just relax and start counting
backwards from 100.

171
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,345
Wait, Gary...

172
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:16,392
Where did you study
anesthesiolo...

173
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:22,790
Hard to port!

174
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,835
Aye aye, Captain Ahab.

175
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:30,798
Thar she blows!

176
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:32,843
Gallbladder dead ahead!

177
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:37,979
Captain Ahab, are you hungry?

178
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:39,415
Do you want a bowl of gruel?

179
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,550
Not now, Mom, I'm in pursuit
of my inner demons.

180
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:46,335
Aye, she's a formidable organ.

181
00:07:46,378 --> 00:07:48,076
Just looks like a whale.

182
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:51,079
It's a metaphor, doofus.

183
00:07:51,122 --> 00:07:52,210
Arrr!

184
00:07:53,734 --> 00:07:55,387
Sweet dreams, honey.

185
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:57,520
I'll try.

186
00:07:57,564 --> 00:07:59,957
Your brother's gonna be
just fine.

187
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:02,525
Yeah, I know.

188
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,179
I'll tell you what.

189
00:08:04,222 --> 00:08:08,662
If I hear any news,
I will come and wake you up.

190
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:11,360
Thank you.

191
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:15,582
Night night.

192
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:47,570
This is ridiculous.

193
00:08:47,614 --> 00:08:50,791
They said an hour and a half;
It's been almost two.

194
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:52,575
I'm gonna go yell at somebody.

195
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:54,229
Good. Yell at everybody.

196
00:08:54,272 --> 00:08:57,232
Uhp, y'all can exhale.

197
00:08:57,275 --> 00:08:58,538
Surgery went great.

198
00:08:58,581 --> 00:08:59,887
Thank you, Jesus.

199
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,063
Sheldon's gonna need
to stay here three, four days,

200
00:09:02,106 --> 00:09:03,325
which is standard,

201
00:09:03,368 --> 00:09:04,892
but, after that
he's good to go home.

202
00:09:04,935 --> 00:09:07,590
Really appreciate it, Doctor.

203
00:09:07,634 --> 00:09:09,984
We can't thank you enough
for takin' care of him.

204
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:11,768
He's extremely intelligent,
isn't he?

205
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:12,900
Yeah.

206
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:15,206
He's our special little boy.

207
00:09:21,082 --> 00:09:22,431
Are you ready
to see your family?

208
00:09:22,474 --> 00:09:23,693
Yes.

209
00:09:23,737 --> 00:09:25,608
That's good, 'cause
they're ready to see you.

210
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:26,740
Okay.

211
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,916
There he is, there's my baby.

212
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,961
Hey, buddy. How you feeling?

213
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:32,615
I brought you some comic books.

214
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:35,618
Hi, Moonpie. Hi, Meemaw.

215
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:36,663
Where's your gallbladder?

216
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:37,794
I want to see it.

217
00:09:37,838 --> 00:09:39,404
They throw it away, honey.

218
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:40,928
Why?

219
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:42,625
Can I go home now?

220
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:45,149
No, baby, they need
to keep you here

221
00:09:45,193 --> 00:09:47,064
a little while,
make sure you're okay.

222
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:48,413
Overnight?

223
00:09:48,457 --> 00:09:50,067
Actually, a...

224
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:51,939
few nights.

225
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:54,245
No, tell them I'm going home.

226
00:09:54,289 --> 00:09:56,639
Shelly, the doctors know
what's best for you.

227
00:09:56,683 --> 00:09:58,293
What's best for me

228
00:09:58,336 --> 00:10:01,122
is to be at home, in my own bed,
with my books and my computer.

229
00:10:01,165 --> 00:10:03,646
Well, I can bring you whatever
you want. Just-just tell me.

230
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,953
I just told you Bring me home.

231
00:10:05,996 --> 00:10:08,651
Moonpie, you're looking
at this all wrong.

232
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:12,089
You got your own room here,
your own TV.

233
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:15,876
Is no one listening to me?
I want to go home.

234
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:18,661
I'm listening, but I
have no say in this.

235
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:23,057
 No surprise,
despite my adamant protest,

236
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,667
I didn't go home.

237
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:26,800
Instead, I had to stay
and suffer in silence

238
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:30,238
like the Southern gentleman
my mother raised me to be.

239
00:10:32,544 --> 00:10:34,982
What's this? I asked for red.

240
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:36,505
All they had was green.

241
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:39,160
Well, then you and I have
a problem, don't we?

242
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:42,598
Tada! A dog.

243
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:48,082
For God's sake,
it's not a real dog.

244
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,171
Here you go. One O.J.

245
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:53,261
I see pulp. No, you don't.

246
00:10:53,304 --> 00:10:54,871
I strained it
with a paper towel.

247
00:10:57,744 --> 00:11:00,355
Now all I can taste is towel.

248
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:04,838
And pulp.

249
00:11:08,232 --> 00:11:11,366
Man, it's Cooper again.

250
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:12,976
Can you take it?

251
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,240
Do I have to? He asked me if all
the jobs for men were taken.

252
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:20,201
I'll get it. You just stay here
and do your nails.

253
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:22,899
What?

254
00:11:22,943 --> 00:11:25,206
Do you know where my mother is?

255
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:27,184
I think she went down to
the cafeteria. What do you need?

256
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,470
I can't sleep.

257
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:29,732
Did you try counting sheep?

258
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:31,995
No, I'm afraid of farm animals.

259
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:35,216
Of course you are. Well, I don't
know what I can do for you.

260
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:37,218
Do you know
the "Soft Kitty" song?

261
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:38,741
No.

262
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:40,830
I'll teach it to you.
Get a notepad.

263
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:45,269
Okay.

264
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:48,272
I got your pillow
and your blanket.

265
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:54,496
Shelly, what do you say?

266
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:57,107
Why does it smell like Missy?

267
00:11:58,152 --> 00:12:00,589
You're doing great, honey.

268
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:06,334
What's going on?

269
00:12:06,377 --> 00:12:08,597
This is Ricky,
your new roommate.

270
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,382
Nice to meet you.

271
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:16,213
I am so sorry.

272
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:28,443
It's just for one night.

273
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:30,314
They said
you going home tomorrow.

274
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:32,055
They also said
I'd have my own room.

275
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:33,927
He better not be contagious.

276
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,798
He's not. Are you sure?

277
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:37,495
Should we ask his doctor?

278
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:39,933
You just asked me and I said no.

279
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:42,762
But you're not a doctor.
Your career stalled at nurse.

280
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:45,590
Okay, listen.

281
00:12:45,634 --> 00:12:49,812
I done put up with your nonsense
long enough, and it ends now.

282
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:52,641
That boy is your roommate,

283
00:12:52,684 --> 00:12:56,384
that's the situation and you
gonna make the best of it.

284
00:12:56,427 --> 00:12:58,081
You get my drift?

285
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:07,308
So comes home tomorrow?

286
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:08,831
Yep.

287
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,660
Everybody's thinking it,
so I'm gonna say it.

288
00:13:11,703 --> 00:13:13,967
This has been a nice break.

289
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,970
Hey. Don't talk about
your brother like that.

290
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:18,841
Since when are you on his side?

291
00:13:18,885 --> 00:13:20,538
Since Dad almost let him die.

292
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:26,022
No! Unbelievable.

293
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:28,851
It's either cartoons
or men in their underwear

294
00:13:28,895 --> 00:13:30,679
banging their heads together.

295
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:33,551
You complain a lot.

296
00:13:34,596 --> 00:13:36,511
Excuse me?

297
00:13:37,904 --> 00:13:40,732
Seriously, dude,
you need to relax.

298
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:42,212
How can I relax?

299
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:45,172
I'm being held captive
in a bacterial playground.

300
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:47,348
Why are you here?

301
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,177
I had to have my gallbladder
removed. Why are you here?

302
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,874
I'm having surgery tomorrow.

303
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:53,528
How come?

304
00:13:53,571 --> 00:13:55,530
I was born with a hole
in my heart.

305
00:13:55,573 --> 00:13:58,533
My mom says everyone is born
with a Jesus-shaped hole

306
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:01,188
in their heart, but I'm guessing
this is different.

307
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:03,886
Yeah, they're gonna
put a patch on it.

308
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,801
And then it just
stays there forever?

309
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,196
Yeah, like a Band-Aid
you never have to pull off.

310
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:11,981
That's great, because that's
the worst thing about Band-Aids.

311
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:14,655
They may have removed
my gallbladder,

312
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:16,768
but not my wicked sense
of humor.

313
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:24,951
Whatcha working on?

314
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:26,648
A welcome home sign for.

315
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:29,129
That's a nice thing.

316
00:14:29,172 --> 00:14:31,653
Yeah, but this "W"
took me half an hour.

317
00:14:31,696 --> 00:14:33,611
You want some help?

318
00:14:33,655 --> 00:14:34,699
Yeah.

319
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:37,920
Georgie, get your ass in here!

320
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:40,488
How did you find out you have
a hole in your heart?

321
00:14:40,531 --> 00:14:42,359
I fainted playing soccer.

322
00:14:42,403 --> 00:14:45,319
I guess I'm fortunate. Why?

323
00:14:45,362 --> 00:14:47,669
I don't and never will
play soccer.

324
00:14:47,712 --> 00:14:50,324
How did you know something was
wrong with your gallbladder?

325
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,978
It started as a minor tummyache,

326
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:54,589
then escalated
to a major tummyache.

327
00:14:54,632 --> 00:14:56,634
Luckily, I handle pain well.

328
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,814
What are you gonna
do when you get home?

329
00:15:02,858 --> 00:15:06,209
Enjoy a bathroom I can relax in.

330
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:07,558
Although I do like that there's

331
00:15:07,602 --> 00:15:09,909
a big red emergency button
in there.

332
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:12,259
I actually don't mind it here.

333
00:15:12,302 --> 00:15:14,435
What about the food?

334
00:15:14,478 --> 00:15:18,047
It's not as good as my grandma's
tamales, but nothing is.

335
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:20,093
How long has she been
taking care of you?

336
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:21,616
My whole life.

337
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:24,401
She'd be here,
but she's watching my brother.

338
00:15:24,445 --> 00:15:28,449
My meemaw takes care of us
sometimes, too.

339
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:32,061
I'm excited for my heart
to be fixed, 'cause then,

340
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:34,629
she won't have to worry
about me anymore. But hey,

341
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:36,544
once they put
the patch on my heart,

342
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:38,981
I'll sort of be like Iron Man.

343
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:42,637
Technically, Iron Man has
a magnet, not a patch.

344
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,726
And technically,
I said "sort of."

345
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:46,510
Touché.

346
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:57,826
Where'd he go? Where's Ricky?

347
00:15:57,869 --> 00:16:00,046
He's in surgery.

348
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:04,050
But look what I'm doing.

349
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:06,400
I'm packing up so
we can go home.

350
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:07,879
Can we wait until he's done?

351
00:16:07,923 --> 00:16:10,012
I think it's gonna
be a while, honey,

352
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:12,014
but why don't we get a move on

353
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:13,537
and then we can
check on him later?

354
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:18,064
Okay.

355
00:16:21,893 --> 00:16:24,896
One second.

356
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,160
Excuse me, Nurse Robinson?

357
00:16:27,203 --> 00:16:30,511
Yes? Will you give this
Iron Man comic to Ricky?

358
00:16:30,554 --> 00:16:32,252
I'll see that he gets it.

359
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:34,602
Thank you.-

360
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:37,213
And thank you
for taking care of me.

361
00:16:37,257 --> 00:16:39,041
You're welcome.

362
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:40,564
You stay healthy.

363
00:16:40,608 --> 00:16:42,088
I will.

364
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:45,700
When did he become nice?

365
00:16:56,145 --> 00:16:58,930
I'll get the next one.

366
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:22,041
I actually missed you.

367
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:24,130
Ain't that nice?

368
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:26,001
What about me did you miss?

369
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,220
I don't know.

370
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:28,830
Well, think about it
and get back to me.

371
00:17:28,873 --> 00:17:31,267
Ha, he gave you homework.

372
00:17:31,311 --> 00:17:33,158
Sheldon, I just got off
the phone with that nurse

373
00:17:33,182 --> 00:17:34,488
from the hospital.

374
00:17:34,531 --> 00:17:36,359
Your little roommate's
gonna be just fine.

375
00:17:36,403 --> 00:17:38,013
Good. That's a relief.

376
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,449
Would you like to go visit him?

377
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:41,973
No. Why?

378
00:17:43,932 --> 00:17:46,543
Okay, here we go,.

379
00:17:46,587 --> 00:17:52,071
One "precision astronomical
refractor telescope."

380
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:54,116
Wow. Thanks, Dad.

381
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,529
 For the next few
weeks, my guilt-ridden father

382
00:17:56,553 --> 00:17:58,860
continued to lavish me
with gifts.

383
00:17:58,903 --> 00:18:01,863
Then the football playoffs
started and that was that.

384
00:18:01,906 --> 00:18:03,691
Time's up.
What did you miss about me?

385

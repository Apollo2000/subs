♪ Beam myself into the future.

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,800
Power has
always been a deadly narcotic,

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,830
and in 1989,

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,800
RadioShack's TANDY 1000 SL

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,670
was my drug of choice.

7
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,310
With an Intel 8086

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,510
running at eight megahertz

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,680
and a five-and-a-quarter-inch
floppy drive,

10
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,550
there was nothing

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,310
I couldn't do.

12
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,220
From adding snazzy graphics

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,280
to my homework...

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,120
So snazzy.

15
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,550
...to easily alphabetizing

16
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,590
my list of enemies
and their crimes.

17
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,690
So easy.

18
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,260
Sheldon, time to go.

19
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,170
We really need
to get one of these.

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,240
What on earth do we need
a computer for?

21
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,170
Yeah, we got you
and your big head.

22
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,240
But we can get

23
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,410
so much accomplished.

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,810
I could use
a spreadsheet program

25
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,440
to keep track of your expenses.

26
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,440
I do that in the back
of my checkbook.

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,210
Yes, but does your checkbook
go "beep" when you open it?

28
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,610
I don't think so.

29
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,180
Plus, the computer

30
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,580
can organize your recipes.

31
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,620
But my recipes are organized.

32
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,850
On index cards.

33
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,390
Like a cave person.

34
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,460
Cave Mom.
I'm gonna call you that.

35
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,290
It doesn't matter, Sheldon.

36
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,790
We can't afford a computer.

37
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,330
Sure we can. It's only $998,

38
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,730
and Dave says we can buy it
on easy monthly payments.

39
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:23,870
That's true.

40
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,900
Stay out of this, Dave.

41
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,270
Come on.

42
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,600
We got to get home.

43
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,370
But...

44
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:29,740
Sheldon, I said no.

45
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:30,740
I can make you a good deal

46
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:31,740
on the floor model,

47
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,710
Mrs. Cooper.

48
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,640
Seriously, Dave,
you're getting on my nerves.

49
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,750
It's not fair.

50
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,380
You bought Missy a Ring Pop.

51
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,580
For ten cents.

52
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,220
- And I'm worth every penny.
- Let's go.

53
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,290
Sorry, Dave.

54
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,220
We're living
paycheck to paycheck.

55
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,460

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,750
Here it is, the TANDY 1000 SL
computer system.

63
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,420
Sheldon was going on and on
about that thing today.

64
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,690
I've never seen one
so easy to use.

65
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,390
Greetings. Need
directions back to your planet?

66
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,330
This technology is more advanced
than we thought.

67
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,260
You know that movie E.T.?

68
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,700
The kid who finds him,
his name is Elliott,

69
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,970
which starts with an "E"
and ends with a "T."

70
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,730
Coincidence?

71
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:31,770
I don't think so.

72
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,540
You're gonna live
with us forever, aren't you?

73
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,340
So, Sheldon wants
a computer?

74
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,540
Ever since he could talk.

75
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,480
But now more than ever.

76
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,480
Well, he should get a job
after school.

77
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,550
Save up and buy one.

78
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,480
Get a job? He's nine.

79
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,820
I mowed lawns
when I was his age.

80
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:46,950
Made pretty good money.

81
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,720
You want Sheldon to mow lawns?

82
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,890
He's so pale,
five minutes in the sun,

83
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,290
he'd burst into flames.

84
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,220
I would pay to see that.

85
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,230
Shut up, Georgie.

86
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,290
I hope you told him

87
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,430
we can't afford it.

88
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,230
Of course.

89
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,230
I could buy it for him,

90
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,400
and then y'all could pay
me back when you can.

91
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,370
Okay, Connie, now you're
just insulting me.

92
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,270
Well, that was not my intention,

93
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,840
but I'm glad to hear it.

94
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,970
I can pay my own bills

95
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,580
and take care of my family.

96
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,980
There are expenses
we could cut back on

97
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,580
so we could afford a computer.

98
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,380
You mean like the money
you give to church?

99
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,520
No, I mean like
the money you give

100
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,450
to the Lone Star Beer company.

101
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,590
Good one, Mom.

102
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,720
- Shut up.
- Shut up, pumpkin. Shut up.

103
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,990
We're not getting a computer.

104
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,990
We don't need your money.

105
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,990
Where are you going?

106
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,000
To get a... glass of milk.

107
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,530
He's lying. He's getting a beer.

108
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,930
Shut up, Georgie.

109
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,840
Mom?

110
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,410
Why are you still up?

111
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,410
Madame Curie is on the roof,

112
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,550
and she's not wearing her hat.

113
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,820
You're just dreaming, baby.

114
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:57,520
But she'll be cold
without her hat.

115
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,790
I'll give her mine.
Now you go to sleep.

116
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,290
Mm, thanks, Mom.

117
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,930
You're the best.

118
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,400
Oh, Lord.

119
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

120
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,310
I'm guessing we're not having
our once-a-week.

121
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,080
Sorry, I only have relations
with gentlemen I like.

122
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,990
Oh, come on. You know how I feel

123
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,020
about your mother meddlin'
in our finances.

124
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,690
She wasn't meddlin',
she was offering to help.

125
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,760
And that computer
is not some silly toy.

126
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,760
Sheldon could use it
for his schoolwork,

127
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,800
and I could use it to...
organize my recipes.

128
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,930
You already got 'em organized
on those little cards.

129
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,400
Yeah, like a cave person.

130
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,940
Well, it doesn't matter.

131
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,470
We can't afford it,
end of story.

132
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,940
Not exactly end of story.

133
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,140
What's that mean?

134
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,480
I've been setting money aside
the last couple of years,

135
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,080
and this might be a good use
for it.

136
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,520
Money from what?

137
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,120
You know, here and there.

138
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,050
Bookkeeping for the church,

139
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,960
some seamstress work,

140
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,990
birthday money
from my Aunt Zelda.

141
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,090
And just how much
of this "here and there" money

142
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,500
you got saved up?

143
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,030
Well, seeing as it's my money,

144
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,830
I don't think
that's any of your business.

145
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,530
None of my business?

146
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,700
You see every nickel

147
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,640
I make,
and you got secret money?

148
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,540
It's not secret.
I just told you.

149
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,140
Where you hiding it?

150
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,110
Well, now you're headed
into secret territory.

151
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,980
Oh, okay.

152
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,580
Just so I'm clear,
my money's our money,

153
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,050
but your money's your money.

154
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,980
That's right.

155
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,850
Oh, good to know.

156
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,090
I'm glad we're not having
our once-a-week

157
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,790
'cause I am not in the mood.

158
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,090
Really?

159
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,890
That's too bad.

160
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,860
Why

161
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,000
No!

162
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,470
That was uncalled for.

163
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:00,010
♪ Love can make you weep...

164
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,910

165
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,710
What girl?

166
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,580
I don't know. A girl.

167
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,820
Well, what'd she say?

168
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,020
It's hard to remember.
This was months ago.

169
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,420
Hey.

170
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,820
Two cases?

171
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,460
You've got to be kidding me.

172
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,030
Don't worry,
I didn't use your money.

173
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,900
I used mine.

174
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,670
♪ Something so strong...

175
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,700
Finish your dinner

176
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,030
and then pack a bag.

177
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,470
We are going to Meemaw's.

178
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,970
Why?

179
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,840
Because your mom and dad
need a break from each other.

180
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,110
For how long?

181
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,110
I don't know. Just pack.

182
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,950
Will I need earmuffs?

183
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,010
Sure, if you want.

184
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,580
Although my almanac
does predict mild temperatures.

185
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,620
Then don't bring it.

186
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,650
I'll just bring my almanac.

187
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,050
You know what, I'll bring both.

188
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,960
Should I pack my toothbrush

189
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,530
or use the one
I keep at Meemaw's?

190
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,900
I got this one.

191
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,700
Nobody cares.

192
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:55,800
I don't want
to go to Meemaw's house.

193
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,500
What if that girl calls back?

194
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,640
Fine, then stay here
with your father.

195
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,640
Sheldon and Missy, we are out
of here in half an hour.

196
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:06,640
Not a lot of time
to pick a toothbrush.

197
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,090
Come on in.

198
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,020
Mom and Dad need a break.

199
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,660
We don't know how long.

200
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,960
What's he got in there?

201
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,460
Everything.

202
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,670
First and ten in the closing
minutes of the fourth quarter...

203
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,240
I ain't never
getting married.

204
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,080
- That so?
- Yeah.

205
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,950
Women are nothing but trouble.

206
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,580
I'll get it!

207
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,980
Hello, Georgie speaking.

208
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,690
Did you run to the phone?
Do you feel stupid?

209
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,560
Who was it?

210
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,220
Nobody.

211
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,860
This little tiff

212
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,560
between your mom and me
will blow over.

213
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,030
Don't make a big deal of it.

214
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,930
I'm not. I'm just saying

215
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,870
I'm better suited
to the single life.

216
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,800
And how do you picture that?

217
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,870
Okay, well, you know the buffet
at Golden Corral,

218
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,000
where there's all kinds
of choices

219
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,940
and you can have
as much as you want?

220
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:10,870
Yeah.

221
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:14,180
It'll be like that,
only with hot girls.

222
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,210
Georgie, I'll bet you
a thousand dollars

223
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,150
you're married before you're 25.

224
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,280
You got a bet.

225
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,720
I feel like

226
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,150
I'm stealing your money.

227
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:28,260
Georgie married
his first wife at 19.

228
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,630
He never paid my father.

229
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,900
Well, I got to tell you
how happy I am

230
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,770
that y'all are spending
the night with me.

231
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,070
Your house smells
like cigarettes.

232
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:40,870
So happy.

233
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,070
Sheldon, we've
talked about this.

234
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,070
You don't need to announce
to people how things smell.

235
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,240
Hmm.

236
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,710
All right, you two, settle in.

237
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,080
Are you and Dad
gonna get a divorce?

238
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,620
Of course not.

239
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,120
Are you sure?
Packing up your kids

240
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,080
in the middle of the night
and moving in with your mom

241
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,620
has all the earmarks
of a divorce.

242
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,320
We're not getting a divorce.

243
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,060
Okay, go to sleep.

244
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,760
Sweet dreams.

245
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:13,870
I can't believe Mom and Dad
had a fight over beer.

246
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,270
I don't think
the fight was about beer.

247
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,940
I think there was
more subtext.

248
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,080
You're probably right.

249
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:24,080
Then again,
I don't know what subtext is.

250
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,620
I don't want to get
in your business,

251
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,950
but since you're
getting in my bed,

252
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,620
- I'm getting in your business.
- Go ahead.

253
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,360
When you leaving?

254
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,230
Very funny.

255
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,860
That wasn't a joke.

256
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,830
I love you, and
I love the kids,

257
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,900
but I love you better
living across the street.

258
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,900
Sorry the end of my marriage
is inconveniencing you.

259
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,370
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

260
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,670
It's a little spat.

261
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,840
No, this was
a long time coming.

262
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,780
This goes to the very core
of our relationship.

263
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,780
I see we're sticking
with dramatic.

264
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,180
The minute he found out
I had money set aside,

265
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,120
he felt threatened.
And you know why?

266
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,790
'Cause it meant that I can
live independent of him.

267
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,690
Sleeping in your
mommy's bed?

268
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,220
You know what I mean.

269
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,330
You gonna buy Sheldon
that computer?

270
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,660
Well, now I have to.

271
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,030
Got it.

272
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,410
You do know I still have
an active love life.

273
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,140
Just go to sleep.

274
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,150
On this very bed.

275
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,250
Oh, Mom.

276
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,230
What's for breakfast?

277
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,960
I don't know. Grab
a bowl of cereal.

278
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,930
Mom usually makes us
eggs and toast

279
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,330
and the occasional meat.

280
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,870
Well, Mom isn't here, is she?

281
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,800
Whoa. Somebody woke up
on the wrong side of the bed.

282
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,070
And you had a choice
'cause you had the whole bed.

283
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,040
Georgie.

284
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,040
Walking on thin ice.

285
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,450
Maybe you should go across
the street and apologize.

286
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,180
I can't do that.

287
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,050
Why not?

288
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,780
'Cause if I do,
it sets a bad precedent.

289
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,490
What's Nixon got to do with it?

290
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,390
What?

291
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,720
You said "bad president,"
like Nixon.

292
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,860
You know, this guy.

293
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,060
You going to apologize?

294
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,030
Dad!

295
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,370
Dad!

296
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,370
If you are, bring back meat!

297
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,350
Hey.

298
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,450
I hope you're happy.

299
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,220
Thank you, Georgie.
That's very kind.

300
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,950
Mom and Dad are fighting
because you want

301
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,290
to get a stupid computer.

302
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,490
What are you talking about?

303
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,520
Mom wanted
to buy it for you,

304
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,790
Dad said they couldn't
afford it,

305
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,090
Meemaw offered
to pay for it,

306
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,860
and now I'm eating
pineapple spears for lunch.

307
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,030
I hate making
my own lunch.

308
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,100
I'm sorry, Georgie,
I didn't know.

309
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,430
Yeah, well, now you do.

310
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,500
What did you get?

311
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,210
A turkey sandwich Mom cut
in the shape of a heart,

312
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,970
a fruit cup, a brownie,

313
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,110
and a note from Meemaw saying
how much she loves me.

314
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,810
I haven't read it yet,
but I bet it's a lot.

315
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,120
I don't even have
a can opener.

316
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,390
Oh, Sugar Apple,
I love you so much.

317
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,920
Your affection for
inanimate objects frightens me.

318
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,790
I'm glad you're happy, Missy.

319
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,800
I'm even happier that I got
a toy, and Sheldon got nothin'.

320
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,400
Well, now, we're
not exactly

321
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,500
done shopping.

322
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,930
Sheldon, you still want
that computer?

323
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,100
I thought we couldn't
afford it.

324
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,540
Don't you worry about that.

325
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,310
Do you want it or not?

326
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,310
More than anything.

327
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,510
All right, then,
let's go get it.

328
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,310
Wait. He gets a computer
and I get a lousy toy?

329
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,120
I thought you liked it.

330
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,320
Not anymore.

331
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,320
Where's the water come out of?

332
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,190
Well, seeing as that's
the dryer, nowhere.

333
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,460
Hmm.

334
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,230
So this one's the washer?

335
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,370
No foolin' you.

336
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,970
What are you doing?

337
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,270
Separating the whites
from the colors.

338
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,870
Whoa, that's racist.

339
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,870
How did I get a rocket scientist
for one son

340
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,080
- and a rodeo clown for the other?
- Oh, man.

341
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,850
I'd give anything
to be a rodeo clown.

342
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,350
They make
people happy,

343
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,550
and they see the rodeo for free.

344
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,990
Mmm.

345
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,060
The home computer
I had long coveted

346
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,160
was finally in my possession,

347
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,470
but it was also destroying
my home.

348
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,870
Thankfully, it came pre-loaded

349
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,210
with a program to help solve
personal problems.

350
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,270
Hello, I am Eliza.

351
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,510
My... parents...

352
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,350
are... fighting...

353
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,950
a lot.

354
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,990
I see.
Can you elaborate on that?

355
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,160
My mother...

356
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:04,260
bought... me...

357
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,430
this...

358
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,300
computer...

359
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,600
but...

360
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:15,970
my dad... says... we can't...

361
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,640
afford it.

362
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,150
Do you have issues
with your mother?

363
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,550
Mmm... No.

364
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:28,120
She... makes me...

365
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:31,220
spaghetti...

366
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,260
with hot dogs...

367
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,360
cut up in it.

368
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,190
Can you elaborate on that?

369
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,530
Are you...

370
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,170
going to help me or not?

371
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:49,670
Hello, I am Eliza.

372
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:52,940
The future might be overrated.

373
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,550
Okay, water's
definitely on.

374
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,550
Try it now.

375
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,180
We want delicate
or regular?

376
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,680
It doesn't matter,
just turn it on.

377
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,390
Let's go with
delicate to be safe.

378
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,990
Nothin'.

379
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,960
Damn it.

380
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,030
Wait, I know what to do.

381
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:11,960
What?

382
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,060
Go across the street
and apologize to Mom.

383
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,630
I got nothin' to apologize for.

384
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,140
You don't have to mean it.
I never do.

385
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,370
Georgie, just mind
your business.

386
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Okay, sorry.

387
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,710
In case you
were wondering,

388
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,570
I didn't mean that.

389
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,580
See how easy it is?

390
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,010
These home computers
are amazing.

391
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,120
I could start a real
bookkeeping business

392
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,080
with that thing.

393
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,090
And that would go a
long way to giving you

394
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,150
the financial independence
you're looking for.

395
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,290
Darn tootin'.

396
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,130
Just for your information,

397
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,490
Sheldon is using the
computer right now

398
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,400
to try and fix your marriage.

399
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,170
Really?

400
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,430
What did it say?

401
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,340
It said...

402
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,740
"Get out of your
mother's house."

403
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,240
- Mom.
- I'm serious.

404
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,540
I want a cigarette,
and I'm tired

405
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,080
of hiding behind
the garage.

406
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,610
You think I should apologize
to George?

407
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,550
Well, of course not. That would
set a terrible precedent.

408
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,050
I think you should
go back over there

409
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,520
to pick up some
clothes for the kids

410
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,050
and be all cold
and distant,

411
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,620
so he has to
apologize to you.

412
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,160
Oh, that's not bad.

413
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,290
Do it.

414
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,220
I will.

415
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,460
Why you drinking tea?

416
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,100
Get out.

417
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,220
Oh, hello.

418
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,690
Hey.

419
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,090
Were you coming back, or... ?

420
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,590
Just to get some clothes
for the kids.

421
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,160
Oh.

422
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,570
Were you coming to talk to me?

423
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,470
Well... yeah.

424
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,310
I, um...

425
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:07,780
...wanted to apologize.

426
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,680
Really?

427
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:17,390
Want to go for a walk?

428
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,590
Talk a little?

429
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,360
Sure.

430
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,630
Hey, kids, come here.

431
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,570
Look at that.

432
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,870
It looks like your mom and dad
are gonna be all right.

433
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,440
Does this mean
we're going home?

434
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,310
It appears so.

435
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,750
I didn't even get to wear
my earmuffs yet.

436
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,790
And this program will allow us
to track our family finances,

437
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,820
create a budget, and
prepare tax documents.

438
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,120
- That's impressive.
- Mmm.

439
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,690
Would you like to know
how much money

440
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,160
you spend on beer annually?

441
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,760
- No.
- I would.

442
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,470
$936.

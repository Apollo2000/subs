1
00:00:03,916 --> 00:00:05,614
I-I'm here
for your mom's Bible study.

2
00:00:05,657 --> 00:00:07,007
I'm glad you could join us.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,138
What are you doing?

4
00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:09,357
Come here for Bible study.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,054
If you want to be
a good Christian,

6
00:00:11,098 --> 00:00:12,771
maybe you should stop
lying through your teeth.

7
00:00:12,795 --> 00:00:16,103
Hey, Mom, just a heads-up
I'm gettin' baptized tomorrow.

8
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:19,541
We did it!

9
00:00:19,584 --> 00:00:20,629
I'm so happy!

10
00:00:20,672 --> 00:00:21,978
I love you.

11
00:00:27,505 --> 00:00:29,420
There are certain phrases

12
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:31,248
that are used by dads
around the world.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

14
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,135
Close the fridge.

15
00:00:48,178 --> 00:00:50,137
You're wastin' money.

16
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,704
I'm having trouble deciding
between pudding and Jell-O.

17
00:00:52,748 --> 00:00:56,099
Well, decide what you want,
and thenopen it.

18
00:00:56,143 --> 00:00:57,753
But I need the visual input.

19
00:00:57,796 --> 00:00:59,363
Does the pudding have a skin?

20
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:02,279
Plus, it's good fun
jiggling the Jell-O.

21
00:01:02,323 --> 00:01:04,368
Do you have any idea
what our electric bill is? Yes.

22
00:01:04,412 --> 00:01:05,674
I do our taxes.

23
00:01:05,717 --> 00:01:07,284
And it's higher
than it should be.

24
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,199
And why do you think that is?

25
00:01:09,243 --> 00:01:10,809
Well, I don't want
to point any fingers,

26
00:01:10,853 --> 00:01:13,247
but Missy sleeps
with a night-light.

27
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,119
Make a choice
and close the door.

28
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:19,079
Okay. There's only one
logical way to settle this.

29
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:20,428
Eenie-meenie...

30
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:22,256
Close the door!

31
00:01:51,285 --> 00:01:52,329
Hey.

32
00:01:52,373 --> 00:01:54,984
What do youwant?

33
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:56,942
I just wanted to
apologize again.

34
00:01:56,986 --> 00:01:58,596
My behavior was crazy.

35
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,294
I blame hormones.

36
00:02:00,337 --> 00:02:02,426
Really? 'Cause I blame you.

37
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,734
Is there any way
you can forgive me?

38
00:02:05,777 --> 00:02:07,214
Please?

39
00:02:10,217 --> 00:02:12,871
Fine. I forgive you.

40
00:02:12,915 --> 00:02:14,960
You're not just saying it
'cause you're trying to be

41
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:17,180
a good Christian and you're
afraid of going to Hell?

42
00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:18,747
Do you want me
to forgive you or not?

43
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,270
Very much.

44
00:02:20,314 --> 00:02:22,751
Then stop talking
and let's move on.

45
00:02:22,794 --> 00:02:24,318
So... so we're friends again?

46
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:26,276
Sure.

47
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,757
Just as friends, would
you wanna hang out

48
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,454
on Saturday night?

49
00:02:30,498 --> 00:02:33,631
In a no-kissing and no-punching-in-
the-face kind of way?

50
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:36,112
I can't. My boyfriend's
taking me to dinner.

51
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,070
Boyfriend, boyfriend,
boyfriend...

52
00:02:38,114 --> 00:02:39,637
You know, I got to run.

53
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:41,987
I'm glad we're friends again.

54
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:50,605
Your brother looks upset.
Really?

55
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:52,346
I would have guessed hungry.

56
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:54,086
See you later.

57
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,701
Mr. Givens,
a moment of your time?

58
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,922
I'm curious about
more cost-effective methods

59
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:05,924
of generating electricity.

60
00:03:05,968 --> 00:03:08,188
And?

61
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:10,015
And I came to you. Go.

62
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:14,106
Well, there's fossil fuels,
like oil and coal.

63
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,978
Too dirty. Hydro?

64
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:17,414
Too wet. Solar?

65
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,764
With this fair skin? Next.

66
00:03:19,808 --> 00:03:21,636
Wind?

67
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:24,508
You know what the problem
with wind is.

68
00:03:24,552 --> 00:03:26,118
It's too reliant on wind.

69
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:27,163
I think I'm looking

70
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,339
for something
a little more indoors.

71
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:30,775
How about nuclear power?

72
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:32,864
It's clean and efficient
and very safe,

73
00:03:32,908 --> 00:03:35,258
until something goes
horribly wrong.

74
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:38,392
That could work.

75
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:39,871
Goody.

76
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:41,308
Are we done?

77
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:44,920
Almost. I have one last question
about nuclear reactors.

78
00:03:44,963 --> 00:03:46,313
What?

79
00:03:46,356 --> 00:03:48,793
How do I build one? Go.

80
00:03:50,317 --> 00:03:53,450
Spoiler alert He didn't know.

81
00:03:53,494 --> 00:03:55,322
Hello?

82
00:03:55,365 --> 00:03:57,324
Hello, my little vicuña.

83
00:03:58,803 --> 00:04:00,457
Well, hello to you, too.

84
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:03,982
And more importantly,
what is a vicuña?

85
00:04:04,026 --> 00:04:08,552
Only what I feel is the cutest
camelid on the planet.

86
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:11,120
Well, I suppose I could ask you
what a camelid is,

87
00:04:11,163 --> 00:04:13,557
but you're just gonna say
more words that I don't know.

88
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:14,906
What's up?

89
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,691
There's an upcoming event
at the university,

90
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:19,346
and I'd like you to be
my plus-one.

91
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:21,435
Well, I'd love to go.

92
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:24,699
Wonderful! It's a date. Bye. Wait, wait.

93
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:26,459
Hang on there, partner. I need
a little more information.

94
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:28,224
When is this event?

95
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,312
This Friday night.

96
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:30,400
What time?

97
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:31,749
I'm not sure.

98
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:33,360
Well, will there be food?

99
00:04:33,403 --> 00:04:34,404
I have no idea.

100
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:35,405
What's the dress code?

101
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:37,146
Not a clue.

102
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:38,756
Well, what doyou know?

103
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,367
You're my plus-one.

104
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,935
Well, you go do a little more
research and get back to me.

105
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:45,285
You got it!

106
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:46,155
Bye.

107
00:04:46,198 --> 00:04:47,678
Wait. What?

108
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:48,679
Love you!

109
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:50,594
Love you, too.

110
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,688
Hello. Is this the studio that
makes the Professor Protonshow?

111
00:04:57,732 --> 00:04:59,037
Excellent.

112
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:01,388
May I speak to him, please?

113
00:05:01,431 --> 00:05:03,955
Well, then I'd like
to leave him a message.

114
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:06,306
My name is Sheldon Cooper,
and I'm trying to build

115
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:09,396
a nuclear reactor,
and I could use his help.

116
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,443
My number is 409-356-6049.

117
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:16,316
Thank you.
I'm gonna hang up now,

118
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,752
because this is long-distance,

119
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:19,841
and my father
doesn't make much money.

120
00:05:19,884 --> 00:05:21,059
Good-bye.

121
00:05:23,758 --> 00:05:25,368
Georgie, question

122
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:26,717
In the hallway earlier today,

123
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:29,372
were you upset or hungry?

124
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,766
Shut up.

125
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:36,379
That's hungry.

126
00:05:36,423 --> 00:05:38,512
Connie, I believe I have answers

127
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:40,470
to all your questions.

128
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:41,819
Lay it on me.

129
00:05:41,863 --> 00:05:44,387
Time The event begins
at 600 p.m.

130
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:47,390
The dress code is
Business attire.

131
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:49,740
Dinner will be served,
but it's been suggested

132
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:52,613
that we eat first,
because the food is dreadful.

133
00:05:52,656 --> 00:05:54,049
Good to know.

134
00:05:54,092 --> 00:05:55,398
And last but not least,

135
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:58,183
a camelid is any member
of the camelidae family,

136
00:05:58,227 --> 00:06:01,665
such as llamas,
alpacas or vicuñas.

137
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:04,189
You didn't ask that one,

138
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:07,497
but, it seemed like
something you should know.

139
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,020
John...

140
00:06:09,064 --> 00:06:11,849
is everybody at this party
gonna be a scientist like you?

141
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:13,808
Not everybody. You'll be there.

142
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:15,418
That's kind of
what I'm gettin' at.

143
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:16,724
Is there a problem?

144
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:18,508
Well...

145
00:06:18,552 --> 00:06:20,423
yeah.

146
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:22,686
I didn't go to college.

147
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,775
I was a total screwup
in high school.

148
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:26,473
I might not fit in at all.

149
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:28,475
Don't be silly.
Everyone's gonna love you!

150
00:06:28,518 --> 00:06:31,303
And I'm excited to show you off.

151
00:06:31,347 --> 00:06:35,960
The general consensus among
the faculty is you don't exist.

152
00:06:36,004 --> 00:06:37,745
Well, I don't know
how I feel about that.

153
00:06:37,788 --> 00:06:41,313
Don't worry... it says more
about me than it does about you.

154
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:45,535
I'll get it.

155
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:48,320
It's like dating
the Encyclopedia Britannica.

156
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,236
Hello, Sheldon.

157
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,021
Good evening.
Do you have any idea

158
00:06:53,064 --> 00:06:55,589
where I could obtain
radioactive material?

159
00:06:55,632 --> 00:06:58,461
That's an interesting question.
What do you need it for?

160
00:06:58,505 --> 00:07:00,420
I'm trying to build
a small nuclear reactor

161
00:07:00,463 --> 00:07:02,552
to provide electricity
for my house.

162
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:04,032
And possibly
the whole neighborhood,

163
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:05,468
if they're nice to me.

164
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:07,470
Fun. The problem
is, I don't know

165
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:10,299
where to get the necessary
radioactive material.

166
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:13,824
Do you happen to have
any unexploded atomic bombs?

167
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:15,522
Not a one.

168
00:07:15,565 --> 00:07:16,523
Shoot.

169
00:07:16,566 --> 00:07:18,960
What about an X-ray machine?

170
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:20,440
Nope.

171
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:21,963
That makes sense.
You're just a kid.

172
00:07:23,268 --> 00:07:24,531
I know!

173
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:27,795
Smoke detectors
contain trace amounts

174
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:30,188
of americium-241.

175
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:31,189
Interesting.

176
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:32,495
But I'd need a lot of them,

177
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:33,453
and they're expensive.

178
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:35,019
True.

179
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:38,022
Hey, I bet if you
call a few companies

180
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:39,850
and say it's for
a school project,

181
00:07:39,894 --> 00:07:41,635
you could get them for free.

182
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:43,506
That's a great idea. Thanks.

183
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,466
You're very welcome.

184
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,251
What a cute kid.

185
00:07:50,687 --> 00:07:52,515
Who was that at the door?

186
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:54,474
Sheldon. What did he want?

187
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:56,476
Nothing.
He just had a science query.

188
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,260
Ooh, biscuits!

189
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:06,050
Where's Georgie?

190
00:08:06,094 --> 00:08:08,052
I don't know.
I called him ten minutes ago.

191
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:09,967
He's probably
curled up in a ball,

192
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:11,316
crying about Veronica.

193
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,709
Why do you say that?

194
00:08:12,753 --> 00:08:13,841
It's just what I'm hearing.

195
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:14,972
From who?

196
00:08:15,016 --> 00:08:17,845
I'm kinda plugged
into this town.

197
00:08:18,454 --> 00:08:19,977
I'll go check on him.

198
00:08:22,023 --> 00:08:24,721
Where exactly you getting
all this info?

199
00:08:24,765 --> 00:08:26,549
There's a lot of kid
sisters out there.

200
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:28,116
We talk.

201
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,857
Honey?

202
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,075
Can I come in?

203
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:33,121
No.

204
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:36,994
Aw, baby,

205
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:39,127
everything all right?

206
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,085
I don't want to talk about it.

207
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:44,436
You might feel better if you do.

208
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,090
Is it about a girl?

209
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:48,223
How do you know?

210
00:08:49,354 --> 00:08:52,140
Sometimes a mother
can sense these things.

211
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:55,012
Veronica has a boyfriend.

212
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:55,970
You mean Dustin?

213
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:57,319
You know him?

214
00:08:57,362 --> 00:08:59,800
Well, yeah, she met him
through the church.

215
00:08:59,843 --> 00:09:01,236
Lovely young man.

216
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,629
You like him?

217
00:09:02,672 --> 00:09:05,632
Well, um...

218
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:10,027
the Lord teaches us
to like everybody.

219
00:09:10,071 --> 00:09:12,421
I just can't stop thinking
about her with another guy,

220
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:14,249
and it's making me crazy.

221
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:16,599
Aw. Why don't you come eat
something?

222
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:17,905
You'll feel better.

223
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:19,123
I can't.

224
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:21,256
I feel like I got punched
in the stomach.

225
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,432
Trust me,

226
00:09:23,475 --> 00:09:25,869
this'll pass.

227
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:28,568
You will meet other girls.

228
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:31,179
They won't be Veronica.

229
00:09:33,137 --> 00:09:34,661
Is he taller than me?

230
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:36,750
It doesn't matter.

231
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:39,100
It's what's inside a person
that counts.

232
00:09:39,143 --> 00:09:41,102
How much taller?

233
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:42,712
A lot.

234
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:47,151
Mrs. Sparks' credit card
got declined at Payless.

235
00:09:47,195 --> 00:09:48,283
No kidding.

236
00:09:48,326 --> 00:09:49,284
She went nuts.

237
00:09:49,327 --> 00:09:50,938
But you didn't hear it from me.

238
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:54,506
Poor baby is just crushed.

239
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,507
Man.

240
00:09:55,551 --> 00:09:57,379
I've been through that. Brutal.

241
00:09:57,422 --> 00:09:59,729
When did I break your heart?

242
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:01,426
It wasn't you.

243
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:03,603
Then who was it?

244
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:04,908
Doesn't matter.

245
00:10:04,952 --> 00:10:06,388
It was a long time ago.

246
00:10:06,431 --> 00:10:08,042
But who?

247
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:10,827
Dad, I don't want
to get ahead of myself,

248
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:13,395
but I think I solved
our electricity problem.

249
00:10:13,438 --> 00:10:14,396
Not now, Sheldon.

250
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:16,180
I wouldn't mind hearing it.

251
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:17,224
Who?

252
00:10:18,182 --> 00:10:20,707
If you want, I'll ask around.

253
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,665
For many children,

254
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:25,189
their happiest memory
is the day they learned

255
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:27,104
to ride a bike.

256
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:30,151
For others, it's when they got
their first puppy.

257
00:10:30,194 --> 00:10:32,414
For me, it was the day

258
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:34,242
I received a box of 57 defective

259
00:10:34,285 --> 00:10:37,549
smoke detectors loaded
with americium-241.

260
00:10:37,593 --> 00:10:39,160
Yes!

261
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:42,990
My dearest Veronica... No.

262
00:10:46,254 --> 00:10:49,257
My beloved Veronica...

263
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,259
Better. It's got "love" in it.

264
00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:54,262
Every minute I'm away from you
is an eternity.

265
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:56,264
But it feels longer than that.

266
00:10:56,307 --> 00:10:59,006
I can't eat, I can't sleep,

267
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:01,008
it's like there's a hole
in my heart

268
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:03,401
that only your love can fill.

269
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:05,012
So true.

270
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:07,057
And yes, I know about Dustin,

271
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:09,364
but he can't love you
the way I do.

272
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:12,106
Because my love
is the kind of love

273
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:14,369
that is true love.

274
00:11:14,412 --> 00:11:17,024
The kind that lovers feel

275
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:19,287
when they're in love.

276
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,854
Beautiful.

277
00:11:20,897 --> 00:11:23,030
So in conclusion, I hope,

278
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:24,422
no, I pray,

279
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:26,076
I hope and pray

280
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,730
that you'll give me the chance

281
00:11:27,774 --> 00:11:29,427
to be the boyfriend you deserve.

282
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:31,168
And when the time is right,

283
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:34,084
I'm able to shower you
with diamonds, houses,

284
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:35,433
boats, and cars,

285
00:11:35,477 --> 00:11:36,913
the husband of your dreams.

286
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:39,916
Loving you with my heart,
my soul,

287
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,526
and my lips,

288
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,267
Georgie Cooper.

289
00:11:44,268 --> 00:11:46,140
Just tell me her name.

290
00:11:46,183 --> 00:11:48,229
It's not important.
It was a long time ago.

291
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:50,318
Then how come I don't know
about it?

292
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:52,450
Because I married you,
and no one else matters.

293
00:11:52,494 --> 00:11:53,713
If that's so,

294
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:55,932
why'd this mystery woman
break your heart?

295
00:11:55,976 --> 00:11:57,238
Come on, Mare.

296
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:58,674
We were young.

297
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,154
We were kids.

298
00:12:00,197 --> 00:12:01,851
Leave it alone.

299
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:07,248
Just tell me her name,
and I'll drop it forever.

300
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,208
You swear?

301
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:12,253
You know I don't swear.

302
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:13,341
You promise?

303
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:15,038
Absolutely.

304
00:12:16,387 --> 00:12:19,216
Kathryn Dempsey. Kathryn Dempsey?!

305
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,020
You watched me make cupcakes
for her daughter's birthday,

306
00:12:21,044 --> 00:12:23,220
and you never told me
you were in love with her?!

307
00:12:23,264 --> 00:12:24,874
I was 15 years old,

308
00:12:24,918 --> 00:12:26,702
and she didn't love me back.

309
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,921
If she did,

310
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:29,705
would you have married
her instead of me?

311
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:30,793
But she didn't!

312
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:32,055
Okay!

313
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:33,883
Now I have my answer.

314
00:12:34,928 --> 00:12:36,364
Kathryn Dempsey?!

315
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:38,627
I was 15!

316
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:45,373
Hey, Sheldon.

317
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,678
Hello, Billy.

318
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:47,636
What you doing?

319
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,464
Building a nuclear reactor.

320
00:12:49,507 --> 00:12:53,250
Cool. I'm having Lucky Charms
for dinner.

321
00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:57,840
What are you gonna do with it
when you're done?

322
00:12:57,864 --> 00:13:00,997
Stand in front of the
refrigerator as long as I want.

323
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,607
Cool.

324
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:05,001
Why are you eating
cereal for dinner?

325
00:13:05,045 --> 00:13:06,307
I was hungry,

326
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,091
and my parents
are in their bedroom kissing.

327
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:42,212
What's this, a love note?

328
00:13:42,256 --> 00:13:44,301
Give that back!
I don't think so.

329
00:13:44,345 --> 00:13:46,303
"To my beloved Veronica,

330
00:13:46,347 --> 00:13:49,741
"Every minute I'm away
from you is an eternity.

331
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:52,222
"But it feels longer than that."

332
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:54,877
"I can't eat, I can't sleep,"

333
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:57,706
"it feels like there's a hole
in my heart that only you."

334
00:14:11,415 --> 00:14:13,156
Champagne?

335
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:15,028
I'm fine, thank you.

336
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:17,160
These are for me.

337
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:18,596
Are-are you all right?

338
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,511
No, I'm very nervous.

339
00:14:20,555 --> 00:14:22,122
That's interesting.

340
00:14:22,165 --> 00:14:24,124
Normally, I'mthe one
who's unsure of himself

341
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:25,560
in a social situation,

342
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:26,953
but tonight, it's you.

343
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:29,129
Yeah. Frickin' fascinating.

344
00:14:29,172 --> 00:14:31,044
Dr. Sturgis, good to see you.

345
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:32,480
Dr. Linkletter.

346
00:14:32,523 --> 00:14:34,743
Please meet my girlfriend,

347
00:14:34,786 --> 00:14:36,179
Connie Tucker.

348
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:37,572
Nice to meet you, Dr. Tucker.

349
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:39,095
I'm not a doctor.

350
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:40,444
But I would like to point out,

351
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:41,706
she's quite real.

352
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,751
I can see that.

353
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:43,926
And our relationship

354
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,406
is more

355
00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:47,538
than just friends. That's enough.

356
00:14:47,582 --> 00:14:48,539
In fact,

357
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,411
it's flat-out erotic.

358
00:14:50,454 --> 00:14:51,978
Change the subject, John.

359
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:54,589
You got it, girlfriend.

360
00:14:54,632 --> 00:14:55,633
Dr. Linkletter

361
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:58,332
is working
on an intriguing theory

362
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,856
of quantum gravity.

363
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,684
Is that so? He can explain it

364
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:04,904
much better than I can.

365
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:05,992
Are you familiar at all

366
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:07,689
with string theory?

367
00:15:07,732 --> 00:15:09,517
Remind me.

368
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,625
Well, basically, it's a string
theoretic interpretation

369
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:13,738
of the graviton.

370
00:15:13,782 --> 00:15:15,827
Every force is an exchange
of particles.

371
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:18,569
Gravity is the exchange
of gravitons.

372
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:20,658
Meemaw, are you even listening?

373
00:15:20,702 --> 00:15:21,746
What?

374
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,053
The graviton
is a massless string.

375
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:25,968
The graviton is
a massless string.

376
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:26,926
Wow!

377
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:28,884
Well, yes, it is.

378
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,667
When did

379
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:30,842
you learn that?

380
00:15:30,886 --> 00:15:33,149
I get around.

381
00:15:33,193 --> 00:15:35,151
In fact,
I would go so far as to say

382
00:15:35,195 --> 00:15:37,153
that every force is an exchange
of particles,

383
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:39,895
and gravity is
an exchange of gravitons.

384
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,852
Correct!

385
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:42,724
Yes!

386
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:44,291
John, where have you
been hiding her?

387
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:45,509
I haven't.

388
00:15:45,553 --> 00:15:46,946
I've talked about her
quite a bit,

389
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:49,731
but you all said she was
a figment of my imagination.

390
00:15:50,688 --> 00:15:51,688
She's dynamite.

391
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,303
Hello. I'd like to speak
to Arthur Jeffries.

392
00:15:56,346 --> 00:15:58,218
He plays Professor Proton.

393
00:15:58,261 --> 00:16:00,002
But you probably know that,

394
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:01,743
since you answer the phone
at the station

395
00:16:01,786 --> 00:16:05,486
that makes the show,
you lucky duck.

396
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:08,010
Then I'd like to leave him
another message.

397
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:10,012
Please tell him Sheldon Cooper
called again

398
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:11,796
and that
I've successfully obtained

399
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,712
the radioactive material
that I'm looking for.

400
00:16:14,756 --> 00:16:16,888
Yes, americium-241.

401
00:16:16,932 --> 00:16:19,804
I have lots of it.

402
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:22,155
I live at 5501 Grant Avenue,

403
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:23,678
Medford, Texas.

404
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:25,767
If you're sending me
an autographed picture,

405
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,029
I already have one.

406
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:29,814
Ooh, how about one
of his bow ties?

407
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:31,599
And then Bryan Larkin
read the letter

408
00:16:31,642 --> 00:16:34,254
out loud in the hall.No.

409
00:16:34,297 --> 00:16:36,430
Georgie used the word "love,"
like, 30 times.

410
00:16:36,473 --> 00:16:37,997
It was pathetic.

411
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,215
That hurts to hear.

412
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:41,000
Really? I think it's hilarious.

413
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:45,134
Also, my math teacher's
pregnant.

414
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:46,396
Well, that's nice.

415
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,399
It might not be her husband's.

416
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:52,707
Whose do you think it is?

417
00:16:58,191 --> 00:16:59,583
Hey.

418
00:16:59,627 --> 00:17:00,845
Hey.

419
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:02,064
Going somewhere?

420
00:17:02,108 --> 00:17:03,065
Alaska.

421
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:05,067
Gonna work on the pipeline.

422
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:06,068
Alaska?

423
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:07,983
That-That's pretty far.

424
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,985
Not far enough,
but it'll have to do.

425
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,379
Look, Georgie,

426
00:17:12,422 --> 00:17:15,208
I know it feels bad
right now, but...

427
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:17,123
I promise it'll get better.

428
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,820
How's it gonna get better?

429
00:17:18,863 --> 00:17:20,300
Veronica thinks I'm a jerk,

430
00:17:20,343 --> 00:17:22,737
and everyone in the school's
calling me Lovey Cooper.

431
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,652
Ooh, that is not a good name.

432
00:17:24,695 --> 00:17:27,263
It doesn't matter, 'cause I'm
never going back to that school.

433
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:28,264
Listen to me.

434
00:17:28,308 --> 00:17:29,526
Hey.

435
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:33,182
You're a good-looking kid,

436
00:17:33,226 --> 00:17:36,185
and you got a big heart.

437
00:17:36,229 --> 00:17:38,796
Once we get you
on a daily shower schedule,

438
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,624
the girls
are gonna be lining up.

439
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:41,799
I don't want girls.

440
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:43,323
I want Veronica.

441
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:45,238
Yeah, maybe you'll get her
and maybe you won't.

442
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:47,240
But someday,
you'll find the woman

443
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:48,763
who was really meant for you.

444
00:17:48,806 --> 00:17:50,417
You mean like Kathryn Dempsey?

445
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,809
Alaska's beautiful.

446
00:17:51,853 --> 00:17:53,550
How 'bout I go with you?

447
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:55,900
Who's Kathryn Dempsey?

448
00:17:55,944 --> 00:17:57,076
I was 15 years...

449
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,817
I was 15 years old!

450
00:18:01,297 --> 00:18:03,212
Connie, tell me,

451
00:18:03,256 --> 00:18:04,605
did you grow up in Texas?

452
00:18:04,648 --> 00:18:07,390
Took my first bath
in a ten-gallon hat.

453
00:18:07,434 --> 00:18:08,783
That's wonderful.

454
00:18:08,826 --> 00:18:11,699
My goodness, you're as funny
as you are beautiful.

455
00:18:11,742 --> 00:18:14,049
That's a nice thing to say

456
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,485
to your friend's girlfriend.

457
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:16,921
Actually, I don't think

458
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:17,922
it isso nice.

459
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:19,576
If I didn't know any better,

460
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,840
I'd say you were sweet-talking
my date right in front of me.

461
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:23,841
You're a pretty smart man, John.

462
00:18:23,885 --> 00:18:24,886
Trust your gut.

463
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,193
Look!

464
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:29,108
Shrimp cocktail. Let's get some.

465
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:30,892
Now, hang on.Hey. Take your hand off her,

466
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:33,895
or there are gonna be
some severe consequences.

467
00:18:33,938 --> 00:18:35,636
Whoa, John, calm down.

468
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:36,811
What do you see in this guy?

469
00:18:36,854 --> 00:18:37,854
All right, that's it!

470
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:41,294
Boy,
you shouldn't have done that.

471
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:43,644
That's enough! Both of you,

472
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:45,167
just cool your jets.

473
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:47,909
This isn't over, Dr. Linkletter!

474
00:18:47,952 --> 00:18:50,868
Anytime, anyplace, Dr. Sturgis.

475
00:18:50,912 --> 00:18:53,436
And your graviton research

476
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,047
is mediocre at best!

477
00:18:57,092 --> 00:18:58,267
Keep moving.

478
00:18:58,311 --> 00:18:59,834
Are you angry with me?

479
00:18:59,877 --> 00:19:00,835
More turned on.

480
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:02,532
Ooh. Great. Let's go.

481
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:12,238
Good morning, Mary.

482
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:17,852
What's that about?

483
00:19:17,895 --> 00:19:19,897
I'm punishing him.

484
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:20,681
What for?

485
00:19:20,724 --> 00:19:21,812
Nothing, really.

486
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:23,684
But once I got started,
I couldn't stop.

487
00:19:25,947 --> 00:19:27,209
I'll get it!

488
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:29,733
The hell?

489
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:31,170
Sheldon Cooper live here?

490
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,218
Mare!

491
00:19:46,707 --> 00:19:49,231
Am I in trouble?

492
00:19:53,670 --> 00:20:01,670

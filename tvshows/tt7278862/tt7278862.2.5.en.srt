1
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,398
<i>Why did I never tell Lila
what I felt for Nino?</i>

2
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,438
<i>Why did I never shout out to her
the pain she caused me?</i>

3
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,038
<i>Why did I never reveal</i>

4
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,080
<i>that, before kissing her,
Nino had kissed me?</i>

5
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,200
- Shall we go, then?
- I don't know, I'm tired.

6
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,120
Me too, I couldn't sleep.

7
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,480
Did Lila say anything to you?

8
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,280
- About what?
- Well, I'll tell you.

9
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,040
Yesterday I kissed her.

10
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,040
But she's married!

11
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,680
- Why did she marry someone like him?
- Because she was in love.

12
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:57,798
I don't believe it. She did it
for money, to help her family,

13
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,158
to set herself up.

14
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,198
If that's the case
she could have married Marcello Solara.

15
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,678
Who's that?

16
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,158
A guy with much more money than
Stefano and who was mad about her.

17
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,480
- And her?
- She didn't want him.

18
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,398
Do you think
things are going well between them?

19
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,880
- With Lila things never go well.
- What do you mean?

20
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,360
Nino...

21
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,558
If you don't want to suffer worse
than you already are,

22
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,320
don't expect anything.

23
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,680
Lila grows cruel when surrounded
by affection and respect.

24
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,120
She's always been like that.

25
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,998
You're back.

26
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,400
- What's happened?
- Pinuccia has gone to Naples.

27
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,718
She yelled that if Rino
doesn't want her at home

28
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,158
then he doesn't love her
as much as he did.

29
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,800
And so she'd rather die with the baby.
She left with Rino and Stefano.

30
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,238
My poor son...

31
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,520
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

32
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,240
I'll go wash, I'll be right back.

33
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,478
You realize why she wanted to go?

34
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,518
Because she wanted
to be with her husband.

35
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,120
She got scared of her feelings.

36
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,960
- She's fallen in love with Bruno.
- Pinuccia?

37
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,718
And him?

38
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,120
- He didn't even notice.
- Are you sure?

39
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,518
- Bruno has his eye on you.
- Don't be silly!

40
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,440
Nino told me.

41
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,720
He didn't say anything to me today.

42
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,238
- Did you swim?
- We did.

43
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,238
- And then? What did you talk about?
- A bit of everything.

44
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,118
Even about the thing I told you?

45
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,360
- What thing?
- The kiss.

46
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,360
No, he didn't say anything.

47
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,800
Better that way.

48
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,920
I don't want to see him again.

49
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,998
<i>Although dazed, I managed
not to say the wrong words.</i>

50
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,198
<i>Nino only wanted to know about Lila
and Lila about Nino.</i>

51
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,398
<i>I was consoled by an idea of centrality,</i>

52
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,920
<i>both needed me
and I would stay in the middle.</i>

53
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,320
Lenù!

54
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,640
- Elena!
- Elena!

55
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,440
I'm here.

56
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,960
I'm here.

57
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,638
- Hi, Lenù.
- We found her!

58
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,678
- Hi.
- Why didn't you come to the beach?

59
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,678
- We waited for you all day.
- We had things to do.

60
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,118
- Did you know Pinuccia has left?
- What a pity we didn't even say goodbye.

61
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,238
- She returned to Naples...
- Let's go out tonight.

62
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,120
We'll come pick you up
and bring you home.

63
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,400
Lila's mother's here.
We can't leave her alone.

64
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,000
- Hi.
- Hi.

65
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,800
Shall we go out tonight?

66
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,760
We'll come and pick you up
and bring you back home.

67
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,200
There's no need.

68
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,078
We have to go to Forio anyway,
I have to call my husband.

69
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,720
We could get ice cream.

70
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,600
All right. See you later.

71
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,038
- Bye, Lenù.
- Bye.

72
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm really glad, Lenù. Bye.

73
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,518
Why did you say yes? You said
you didn't want to see him anymore.

74
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,840
Of course I said yes,
I have to call Stefano.

75
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,360
What would it look like
if we ran into them?

76
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,920
- Ran into who?
- No one.

77
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,640
I have to call Stefano from the bar.

78
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,718
- Then I'll come too.
- What are you coming for?

79
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,920
I want to get out a bit.

80
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,398
Bruno...

81
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:27,278
- Soccavo.
- Ah, Soccavo...

82
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,598
As in the salami factory
in San Giovanni a Teduccio?

83
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,878
He's my father actually.

84
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,038
And how's business?

85
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,198
Good, thank God,
but I'm not involved that much.

86
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,598
My husband has recently
started making shoes.

87
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,080
Mamma.

88
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,400
- What did I say?
- Pardon?

89
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,438
Are we all having ice cream?

90
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,678
- Yes.
- Not me, thanks.

91
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,998
Do it for me, a small cup, just a taste.

92
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,040
All right, a small one.

93
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,398
We'd like four regular cups
and a small one.

94
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,080
And some water, if possible. Thank you.

95
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:15,718
- Nino, how's your mother?
- Well, she's here on vacation too.

96
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,358
And your father?

97
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,678
I remember when they took you
around in a pram.

98
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,518
- Really?
- Of course.

99
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,560
Excuse me, I'm going to make my call.

100
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:33,518
I knew your grandfather too.
God rest his soul.

101
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,080
He got that house after the war.

102
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,400
And now a romantic dance.

103
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,840
If you'll excuse me.

104
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,278
He hasn't gone to pay, has he?
I'm the oldest, it's up to me.

105
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,478
No, it's on me,
as if I'd let a lady pay!

106
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,078
Very well, thank you.

107
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,398
Good evening, may I?

108
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,238
- May I have the honor of this dance?
- Who, me?

109
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,478
- Maybe you're mistaken.
- Please, humor me.

110
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,400
- No, I'm sorry. I can't.
- Too bad.

111
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,238
- Lenù, is he still looking?
- Yes.

112
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,798
He's in love,
Cupid has fired his arrows.

113
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,160
- Yeah, Cupid...
- Cupid!

114
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,080
Please, go and call Lila.
It's all melting here.

115
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,118
Excuse me, the phone?

116
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,240
- The booths are at the back.
- Thank you.

117
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,000
Lila... Sorry.

118
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,880
Careful, miss.

119
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,678
<i>The lively conversations
faded to distracted sentences,</i>

120
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,318
<i>seeking the way to more private words.</i>

121
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,598
<i>I suffered, but I must admit,
with an underlying sense of disbelief</i>

122
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,760
<i>that made the suffering come in waves.</i>

123
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,240
- Let's go for a swim.
- No, I don't feel like it.

124
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,918
Let's go get some coconut.

125
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,360
- What if someone sees them?
- There's no one who can see them.

126
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,760
Leave them be.

127
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,960
Would you care
for a <i>cedrata</i> at least?

128
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,480
No.

129
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,918
<i>I saw them as fallen divinities.</i>

130
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,598
<i>Once so clever, so intelligent,</i>

131
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,880
<i>now so stupid,
caught up in a stupid game.</i>

132
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,640
Thank you, good night everybody.

133
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,800
What are you going to do
when you finish school?

134
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,240
I haven't thought about it.
I'll find a job.

135
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,958
- What would you like to do?
- I don't know.

136
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,998
- Why, do you know?
- For now I'm at university.

137
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,680
- And so?
- I have time to think about it.

138
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,118
It's easy for you,
you can always work for your father.

139
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,680
Yes, but I'm studying
so I can have other opportunities.

140
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,680
You're doing the right thing.

141
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,398
Besides, I wouldn't mind
working for my father,

142
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,238
I'd be working in the office,
in administration,

143
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,720
not with the workers
making sausages.

144
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,358
Is it that interesting?

145
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,158
Yes, but it's stuff
that doesn't concern you.

146
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,878
- Come on, speak, tell us what it is.
- A letter.

147
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,160
- From whom?
- From Nadia.

148
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,198
Listen to this.

149
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,480
"When I eat
chocolate ice cream, I miss you."

150
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,478
"When I hear <i>'Si è spento il sole'</i>
on the radio, I miss you."

151
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,918
"When I smell your scent
on the shirt you left me, I miss you."

152
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,558
"I always miss you. Night and day."

153
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,720
That's enough, give it back to him.

154
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,720
You're embarrassed, huh?

155
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,478
It's your fault. How can your girlfriend
write this stuff?

156
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,238
When you fall in love with someone,

157
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,558
you don't ask her
if she knows how to write a love letter.

158
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,718
Do you love her? Why?

159
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,278
Because she lives
on Corso Vittorio Emanuele?

160
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,758
In a house full of books
and old paintings?

161
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,360
- Because she's a teacher's daughter?
- Enough, give me those pages.

162
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,318
I'll only give them to you
if you tear them up in front of us.

163
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,238
And then?

164
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,838
And then we'll all write
a letter together

165
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,440
where you say you're leaving her
and we'll post it tonight.

166
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,680
All right. Let's do it.

167
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,998
- Are you really going to tear it up?
- Yes, but on one condition.

168
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,480
That you leave your husband.

169
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,520
We'll go to the phone
and you can tell him.

170
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,318
Who do you think you're talking to?

171
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:22,638
How can you compare the letter from
that little bitch from a good family

172
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,520
with my marriage and my whole life?

173
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,200
You don't understand a thing.
Let's go, Lenù.

174
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,280
- Will I see you tomorrow?
- I don't know.

175
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,960
Lenù...

176
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,280
I can't sleep at night anymore.

177
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,600
My head fills with what Nino said
and what I want to say to him.

178
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,880
I refrained.

179
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,758
More than once I said
that I'm not like Pinuccia,

180
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,200
I can do whatever I want,
I can start and stop.

181
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,960
I kept my lips pressed shut,
tightly shut.

182
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:30,358
But then I discovered what a kiss was,
because I didn't know.

183
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,640
I swear to you, I didn't know.

184
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,640
How many things I've missed...

185
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,160
I'm having a fling
when in fact I'm married.

186
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,920
Help me.

187
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,440
What shall I do?

188
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,280
Do what you like, I'm going to bed.

189
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,080
Please...

190
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,720
Give me some advice.

191
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,840
No, you have to decide yourself.

192
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,960
Did you see what Pinuccia did?
In the end she behaved better than you.

193
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,440
All right.
Tomorrow I won't go to the beach.

194
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,320
I'll wait for Stefano and the day after
I'll return to Naples with him.

195
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,558
<i>I decided to go find him,
to see him at all costs.</i>

196
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,558
<i>Now that our departure was approaching,</i>

197
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,238
<i>now that the power of seduction
Lila had exerted over him</i>

198
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,838
<i>would not envelop him anymore,</i>

199
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,718
<i>now that she had decided
to return to the life she belonged to,</i>

200
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,600
<i>the relationship between
me and him could start again.</i>

201
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,720
Nino! Bruno!

202
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,560
Lenù! How lucky!

203
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,400
Wait, I'll come down.

204
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,320
Good morning.

205
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,000
Hi, Lenù, I was just coming
to look for you.

206
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,800
It only takes a moment
to change your life.

207
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,798
I'm going to look for a job,
I want to quit studying.

208
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,880
What are you talking about?

209
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,760
Can you give this to Lila?

210
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,598
- What is it?
- Just give it to her, don't worry.

211
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,398
- Swear to me you'll give it to her.
- It's pointless.

212
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,038
Swear.

213
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,840
I came to tell you we're leaving
for Naples tomorrow.

214
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,398
- Who decided that?
- She did.

215
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,238
I don't believe it.

216
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,878
Stefano's coming this morning
and tomorrow we leave for Naples.

217
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,120
- It won't do any good.
- Please, take it to her. Now!

218
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,200
Kids, come here.

219
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,038
Hi, Stefano.

220
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,918
- Where have you been?
- For a walk.

221
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,518
- What are you up to with her?
- Meaning?

222
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,160
She's tired of Ischia,
she wants to go to Amalfi.

223
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,558
I don't know anything about it.

224
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,558
Lenù, don't put
wrong ideas into her head.

225
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,318
It's money out the window,
we're paid up here for the month!

226
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,678
You think we can just go to Amalfi?
Cut it out!

227
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,040
- Where is she?
- Upstairs.

228
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,720
Lila...

229
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,280
This is for you.

230
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,480
What does it say?

231
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,918
To me nothing. It's for Nadia.

232
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,760
He's leaving her.

233
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,000
You hold onto it for tonight.
Hide it.

234
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,880
It's got the address.

235
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,198
Why did you ask Stefano
this absurd thing about Amalfi?

236
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,040
I don't get it.

237
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,880
I don't either.

238
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,920
Besides, we're not leaving
tomorrow anymore.

239
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,718
Bye, Lenù.

240
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,480
The ferry for Naples is departing.

241
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:50,598
Bear with me, I was angry.
Just as well you were there.

242
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,480
Take care.

243
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,958
I'll call you every night.

244
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,840
For Naples, this way.

245
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,838
The ferry for Naples is departing.

246
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,598
Let's go to the tobacconist
to send the letter.

247
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,320
Time to go back to the city.

248
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,080
What are you doing? Wait for me!

249
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,958
Lila!

250
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,158
I don't know what you have in mind,
but you're playing with fire.

251
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,200
Next time Stefano's staying for a week,
what will you do?

252
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,680
Do you really think
you can play with people's lives?

253
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,318
Nino's leaving his girlfriend.

254
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,798
He wants to quit studying
and look for a job!

255
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,158
You should be proud of me,
the cleverest guy in the world

256
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,280
has left the teacher's daughter
for the shoemaker's daughter!

257
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,438
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

258
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,678
I have to send this letter to Naples.
Which stamp do I need?

259
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,200
I'll take care of it.

260
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,600
Thank you.

261
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,318
That's the Cygnus constellation.

262
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,718
- Which one?
- That cross over there.

263
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,520
- Sure?
- Yes.

264
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,278
Whereas that's Vega, it's very bright.

265
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,078
It's 25 light-years away,

266
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,038
if it exploded at this very moment,
we wouldn't even notice.

267
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,800
We'd only see the explosion in 25 years.

268
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,278
Also, if the Sun exploded
we'd notice after eight minutes.

269
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,120
Are you studying astronomy?

270
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,278
To me they're like random shards
in blue bitumen.

271
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,080
It frightens me.

272
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,480
It's not frightening, it's beautiful.

273
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,880
For me it's hypnotic,
I'd never stop looking.

274
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,560
Sit down, Lenù.

275
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,080
Try this white wine,
a friend of my father makes it.

276
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,520
Just think, he's a marquis.

277
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,078
Bruno, what are you doing?

278
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,640
Leave me alone,
I don't like you like that!

279
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,680
- You don't even like me a little bit?
- No.

280
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,758
Lenù, what is it?

281
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,960
I'm crying for no reason,
I'm just an idiot.

282
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,798
- You're so beautiful...
- Bruno, please.

283
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,918
I like you so much.

284
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,598
Every time I see you
my heart beats fast, I sweat...

285
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,480
We really have to go now.

286
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,718
- Stay a bit longer.
- Lila, I want to go home!

287
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,280
Lila, let's go!

288
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,840
- Why are you shouting?
- I want to go home!

289
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,478
Relax, we're going now.

290
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,078
What if you get pregnant?

291
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,438
There's no danger of that, we just kiss.

292
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,358
Anyway, I won't get pregnant,
he knows what to do.

293
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,798
What?

294
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,238
He said he'd use a condom.

295
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,398
- What's that?
- I don't know, a thing you put over it.

296
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,200
You don't even know what it is
and you trust him?

297
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,158
You have to help me.

298
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,158
- What help?
- I want to sleep at Nino's.

299
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,838
Are you crazy?

300
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,438
And I'm crazier than you
that I even listen to you.

301
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,240
Don't get mad,
when we go back to Naples it'll be over.

302
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,998
Listen, Bruno has to go to Naples
for three days.

303
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,918
You convince my mother
that Nella has invited us to sleep over.

304
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,960
You're out of your mind.

305
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,840
Aren't we friends anymore?

306
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,998
- A party for Miss Oliviero?
- Yes.

307
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,638
Don't you remember her?
Our teacher in elementary school.

308
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,798
She's in Barano with her cousin Nella.

309
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,958
- Here.
- Thank you.

310
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,718
She's here to recover
and is having a little party.

311
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,798
- She invited us.
- No, Lenù, you go, Lila can't.

312
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,238
If her husband finds out she slept
somewhere else he'll be angry.

313
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,000
So we won't tell him.

314
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,638
He's in the neighborhood,
we're here, he'll never find out.

315
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,640
Things always get found out.
Absolutely not.

316
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,278
How many lies have you told Papa
to get a moment to yourself?

317
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,320
Oh, mother of God...

318
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,080
Come on, Mamma.

319
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,520
Please.

320
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,318
All right, but...

321
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:42,160
promise me you'll be back
before Stefano, or else...

322
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,280
Thank you, Mamma.

323
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,118
<i>Indecent words flooded my brain.</i>

324
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,678
<i>I was helping her to take Nino
in my place, to get laid in my place,</i>

325
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,318
<i>to fuck him for a whole night.</i>

326
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,560
<i>In that moment I wished they'd drown.</i>

327
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,000
Citara Beach!

328
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,280
Citara Beach!

329
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,240
It's her.

330
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,680
- You were right.
- I told you it was her.

331
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,638
What a surprise!
I'm so pleased to see you.

332
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:16,238
We took the day off,
Pinuccia and Alfonso are in the shop.

333
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,958
Actually, only Alfonso is,
Pinuccia can't make the effort.

334
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,918
She told us you came here.

335
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,358
- Michele, what are we doing?
- Keep going, we'll see you later.

336
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,840
We'll wait for you at the bar.

337
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,838
Do you want to come up
and say hello to Nunzia?

338
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,840
No, thanks,
we've got the ferry in two hours.

339
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,518
Lila?

340
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:03,078
Lila's in the water,
she's learned to swim really well.

341
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,438
She goes out where
you can't touch the bottom.

342
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,958
- Shall we go eat something?
- Yes, but let's wait for Lila.

343
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,080
- Then I call her.
- No, don't bother her.

344
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:22,278
- Marcello? How is he?
- Good.

345
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:26,078
- Has he got a girlfriend?
- Who knows!

346
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,478
He's handsome,
he has plenty of opportunities.

347
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,000
You look so good, too. You're suntanned.
Your hair's lighter.

348
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,318
Hi.

349
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,718
- Hi, I'm Nino.
- Hi, I'm Gigliola.

350
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,238
This is Michele.

351
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,000
Hi.

352
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,760
We've known each other
since elementary school.

353
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,640
He used to live in the neighborhood too.

354
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,440
Don't you know him?
He's Sarratore's son.

355
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,320
You're the son of the guy
who writes for <i>Roma.</i>

356
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,198
Stefano told me you like the new styles.

357
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,118
Your brother brags
that he came up with them.

358
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,358
- It's the truth.
- That's why they stink.

359
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,118
They'll sell better
than the previous ones.

360
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:35,878
- Only if you're in the shop.
- Gigliola's there, she's doing great.

361
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,640
- I need Gigliola in the pastry shop.
- They need me in the grocery store.

362
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,238
You'll move
to Piazza dei Martiri, <i>signora.</i>

363
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,560
And you'll have carte blanche.

364
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,198
And tell your father

365
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,998
he shouldn't have written
that he didn't like the decor.

366
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,158
When you take money, you have
to write that everything's good,

367
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,358
or else you won't see any more money.

368
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,600
Have a good day.

369
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,318
- He saw you.
- Who is he?

370
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,238
A shitty mobster
who thinks he's a bigshot.

371
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,798
Keep it down.

372
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,238
He's your husband's partner,
he'll tell him everything.

373
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,998
Everything what?
There's nothing to tell.

374
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,118
- They'll tell.
- Who gives a damn!

375
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,760
You sure you won't get into trouble
because of me?

376
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,198
We've decided, haven't we?

377
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,040
Tonight, I'm sleeping over
at your place.

378
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,280
Do you mind if I go home?

379
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,318
I promised Bruno
I'd do summaries for the exams.

380
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,438
He'll be disappointed
if I haven't done them.

381
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,400
Come whenever you like.

382
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,280
I'll be waiting for you.

383
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,440
- Are you sure?
- Very sure.

384
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,040
Lenù, I'm fond of you.

385
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,680
And I always will be.

386
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,160
I hope at least once in your life
you feel what I'm feeling now.

387
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:05,238
Here we are!
Lenù, this is the one you like.

388
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,238
- Thank you, it's my favorite.
- Children, the cake!

389
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,638
- I'll go get the coffee.
- Thank you, Nella.

390
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,120
The first slice...

391
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,438
...is for Lenù.

392
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,078
- Thanks.
- Pinuccio, want some cake?

393
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,560
No.

394
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,360
Thank you.

395
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,358
- Shall we go for a walk?
- Yes, Donato, let's go for a stroll.

396
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:37,918
- Lenù, come with us.
- No, thank you, I prefer to help Nella.

397
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,878
- Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
- No, I'm happy to.

398
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,158
Besides, I feel very tired.
Exhausted.

399
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:51,840
I'm ready, I'll get my purse.
Pino, change your shoes.

400
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,200
Exhausted...

401
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,240
What a lovely evening.

402
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,640
Lenù...

403
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,280
This is yours.

404
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,640
Donato, shall we go? See you later.

405
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:41,118
<i>All at once I realized
why I'd never had Nino.</i>

406
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,078
<i>I didn't know
how to let myself go beyond,</i>

407
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:49,400
<i>I didn't possess that emotional power,
I lagged behind, waiting.</i>

408
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,800
<i>She took the things she really wanted.</i>

409
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,838
<i>I wished that right there
on the sea shore</i>

410
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,758
<i>murderers would come out of the night
and torture my body,</i>

411
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,398
<i>that the worst would happen to me,
something so devastating</i>

412
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,038
<i>it would stop me from facing that night,</i>

413
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,998
<i>the hours and the days to come,</i>

414
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,678
<i>reminding me
with increasingly crushing proof</i>

415
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,160
<i>of my unsuited condition.</i>

416
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,480
Lenù!

417
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:41,918
It's me. I knew I'd find you here.

418
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,358
Nella was worried
and Lidia asked me to look for you.

419
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,520
I told them to go to bed,
that I knew where to find you.

420
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,638
And sure enough, here you are,

421
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,878
listening to the breath of the sea

422
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,080
and contemplating
the divine beauty of the sky.

423
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,920
You'll have to forgive me, Lenù.

424
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,080
The heart wants what it wants.

425
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,880
And you're too beautiful.

426
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,040
What an exaggeration!

427
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,198
The problem with youth is one doesn't
have the eyes to see oneself

428
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,040
and the emotions
to feel oneself with objectivity.

429
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,638
The mirror exists and it's objective.

430
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:47,560
The mirror... The mirror is
the last thing you can trust.

431
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,720
I bet you don't feel
as pretty as your friends.

432
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,120
Yes.

433
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,280
Whereas you're much
more beautiful than them.

434
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:18,880
I know you as well as I know myself.
You and I have the same sensibility.

435
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,040
Two souls...

436
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,480
...can meet and recognize one another
even in the dark.

437
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,398
<i>Perhaps we really
are made of the same stuff,</i>

438
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,238
<i>perhaps we really
are condemned without blame</i>

439
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,720
<i>to the same, identical mediocrity.</i>

440
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:12,318
I'm a bit cold.

441
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:16,480
Come here.

442
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,320
How sweet this night is.

443
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,960
And how sweet you are.

444
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,958
This is a secret between me and you,

445
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,680
you must lock it away in your heart.

446
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:20,240
Lenù, where can we meet tomorrow?

447
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,078
You're mistaken.

448
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,880
We won't see each other
tomorrow or the day after.

449
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:46,398
- We'll never see each other again!
- What?

450
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,198
Let me make myself clear.

451
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,638
What Antonio, Melina's son,
wants to do to you

452
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,358
is nothing compared with
what Michele Solara will do to you,

453
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,960
if I say the word to him.

454
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:02,798
Did you know, he can't wait
to smash your face in

455
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,600
after the shitty article you wrote?

456
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,798
<i>I didn't once regret accepting
what had happened,</i>

457
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,598
<i>I had no second thoughts
and I felt proud of it.</i>

458
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,078
<i>That's how I wanted it to be
and I imposed it on myself,</i>

459
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,440
<i>but that man,
I never wanted to see him again.</i>

460
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,200
Sound the horn again.

461
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:08,520
Let's go, Lila! Hurry up!

462
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,880
I want to study what he studies.

463
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,038
But I don't want to learn
for the university,

464
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,320
I want to learn for him.

465
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,718
I want to read the same books as him.

466
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:37,318
- I want to understand what he thinks.
- Don't talk crazy.

467
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,480
You said you'd see him this time
and that was it.

468
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,918
Do you think, if I work hard,

469
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:47,678
I can understand the things he does?

470
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,438
No, you're too behind in everything.

471
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,320
It's hard stuff, you don't read
the papers, you don't know anything.

472
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,560
I told you he thinks highly of you.

473
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,000
Can you help me study?

474
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,838
No, it's not something you should do.

475
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,478
He wants to quit university
because of you.

476
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,838
He'll study,
that's what he was born for.

477
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,958
And I'll help him.

478
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:30,360
You're married, get it out of your head.
You're not suited to his needs.

479
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,360
And who is suited?

480
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,840
Nadia?

481
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,600
But he dumped her for me.

482
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,400
I don't want to hear any more of this.

483
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,920
Do what you like.

484
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:07,278
- Hi, Stefano.
- Hi.

485
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,400
I'll make coffee.

486
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:18,320
- Did you two have fun?
- A lot.

487
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:23,560
Tell me about it, how was the party?

488
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:34,160
No, Lenù!
Sit with us, so you can tell me.

489
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:52,478
Well? There's not much to tell.

490
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:57,440
There was a dinner for Miss Oliviero
and we stayed the night there.

491
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,280
That's nice.

492
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,880
So, if there's nothing to tell
about the dinner...

493
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,438
Tell me if it's true you go swimming
with Sarratore's son.

494
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,238
Sometimes. Why?

495
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:24,000
How many times? Once, twice,
three times, how many?

496
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,880
Lenù, do you know?

497
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,640
Once.

498
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,520
He came by to see us
and we all went for a swim together.

499
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:54,558
And you and Sarratore's son
are so close you hold hands?

500
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,518
- Who told you that?
- Ada.

501
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,678
- And who told Ada?
- Gigliola.

502
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,198
- And who told Gigliola?
- She saw you, bitch!

503
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,918
She came here with Michele
and saw you.

504
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,200
And you weren't with Elena,
you were by yourselves, holding hands!

505
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:19,200
I was such a fool to marry you.
You're worthless.

506
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,878
You know that Michele Solara
wants me in the shop.

507
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,878
You know that's why Gigliola
would kill me if she could.

508
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:37,960
- And what do you do?
- You believe her.

509
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:43,160
She manipulates you like a puppet.

510
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:52,758
I'm going for a walk.
Lenù, come with me.

511
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:57,318
The fuck you going? Is it true
you swim with Sarratore or not?

512
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,718
- You hear me?
- Stop it!

513
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:05,558
- Come here!
- Stop it, Stefano!

514
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,438
It's not true! Gigliola's just jealous!

515
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:12,758
- I'll kill you!
- Yes, it's true! It's true!

516
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:17,718
It's true! Sarratore's son
and I swim together!

517
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:21,880
We hold hands, we kiss,
we touch each other!

518
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,878
He's fucked me a hundred times!

519
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:30,758
That's how I realized what shit you are,
and how worthless!

520
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,680
Is that enough?

521
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:44,600
It's not true.
It's not true, Stefano. It's not true.

522
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,560
It's not true, Lila.

523
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,120
It's not true at all.

524
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,840
Pack your bags,
we're leaving tomorrow.

525
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:58,198
<i>I decided that from that moment
I would live only for myself.</i>

526
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:02,078
<i>And when I was back in Naples,
I wouldn't seek out Lila anymore.</i>

527
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,440
<i>I wouldn't seek out Nino anymore.</i>

528
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:15,040
Good morning, miss.
Miss, something for the music?

529
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:20,758
Some change? Do I have to speak
Neapolitan for you to understand?

530
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,600
<i>Guten tag, fräulein.</i>

531
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:30,000
Hello, miss. <i>Guten tag.</i>
Do you understand Neapolitan?

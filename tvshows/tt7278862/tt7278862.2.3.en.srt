1
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,838
CARRACCI'S GROCERY STORE

2
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,518
This goes over here!

3
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,358
Signora, tell me
what to do and I'll do it!

4
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,398
Lila, in your condition
you need to be careful.

5
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,278
Be careful with those shelves,
or they'll fall!

6
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,918
They have to be fitted to the wall.

7
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,758
- That's the sixth time you've told me.
- And this is the seventh!

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,920
- By all means. As you wish.
- And fit this properly too.

9
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,318
Why does she want to do everything?
She shouldn't exert herself.

10
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,880
How would I know?

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,718
- Do you think I've calmed down?
- No, it doesn't look like it.

12
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,158
I gave Carmela much higher pay
than at the notions store.

13
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,278
I made Stefano increase Ada's pay

14
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,878
and I gave Pasquale money
to go to the dentist.

15
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,238
I don't want to hear a word from anyone.

16
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,998
- Yes, but you need to calm down.
- You can't work like this every day.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,880
- Let someone help you.
- Out of my way.

18
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,198
Those two assholes,
my brother and my husband, used me.

19
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,040
They don't think I'm a person,
but a thing.

20
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,760
They kept Michele happy,
like they did with Marcello.

21
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,840
"We'll give him Lila. We'll hang her
on the wall, because she's nothing."

22
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,398
They'll have to kill me first
if they want to use my picture.

23
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,998
It's a good thing,
they only put actresses on posters.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,040
Again? I'm not an actress.

25
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,998
Where are you going with that register?
It has to go here!

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,638
Can't you see it's too low?
One, two, three...

27
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,958
<i>She had something in mind
to divert her from her constant turmoil.</i>

28
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,198
<i>A violent, definitive outburst</i>

29
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,758
<i>to free her mind and body
of pent-up energy.</i>

30
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,478
<i>My intuition was confirmed
in the tenth week of pregnancy.</i>

31
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,038
<i>Lila came to me
with her eyes shining feverishly.</i>

32
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,158
<i>She had glue, scissors, paint.</i>

33
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,318
<i>She'd found a solution
for the photograph</i>

34
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,320
<i>and wanted me to help her,
to support her.</i>

35
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,158
Is it the frame, the wall, the light?

36
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,838
- I have to see it.
- And then, enough, okay?

37
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,878
Yes, enough.

38
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,598
Lovely lady, now will you tell us
what you've got in mind?

39
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,198
Or do you simply want
to ruin our evening?

40
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,758
- Put it on the floor.
- What for?

41
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,920
Now I'll show you.

42
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,598
Don't be stupid.

43
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,838
You have no idea what it cost!
If you ruin it, you'll be sorry!

44
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,640
No. On the floor.

45
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,000
Lenù, help me.

46
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,720
Hand me the cutter.

47
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,640
Get the scissors.
The newspaper, too.

48
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,278
<i>I recognized the expression
her face assumed</i>

49
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,158
<i>when a thought would arrive
from deep inside her and burn her brain.</i>

50
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,398
<i>How exciting those moments were,
how I liked being at her side,</i>

51
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,118
<i>slipping into her intentions,
coming to predict them.</i>

52
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,118
<i>I felt she was seeing something
that was not there</i>

53
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,280
<i>and that she was working
so we could see it too.</i>

54
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,400
It's finished.

55
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,240
All done.

56
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,278
I'm not hanging this eyesore in my shop!

57
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,678
I agree.

58
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,598
We have to sell. With this thing
on the wall, people will run away!

59
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,118
Tell her it's ridiculous, please!

60
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,238
I told you, you can't reason with her.

61
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,038
You have to say:
yes or no, and that's it.

62
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,078
Or else it's a waste of time.

63
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,518
In a magazine I saw that Rossano Brazzi
has a picture like this in his house.

64
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,638
- See?
- And what does that mean?

65
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,878
That Rossano Brazzi knows everything?

66
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,678
That you know everything
and me and Pina don't?

67
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,118
Shut up.

68
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,078
- Like this or not at all.
- I don't get it, I can't...

69
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,000
Shut up, Gigliola.

70
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,638
I like it, signora.
I get what you were trying to do.

71
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,800
You can see the shoes well,
they stand out.

72
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,798
Brava.

73
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,638
You're stubborn, but when you do
something, you do it right.

74
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,718
We gotta decide,
the shop opens tomorrow.

75
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,280
It's already decided, I like it.

76
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,840
Yes, you've convinced me, too.

77
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,160
We're ready to turn it on.

78
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,240
Let me see this sign, then.

79
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,278
See what a beauty.

80
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,198
If they're Cerullo shoes,
why is the shop named Solara?

81
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,078
Why d'you have to be a pain in the ass?
Wanna make more trouble?

82
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,878
You ruined the photo
and those two fools even agree.

83
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,478
- Be satisfied for once.
- D'you borrow money from the Solaras?

84
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,758
Stefano, too?

85
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,600
That's why you do whatever they say,
you're in debt to them!

86
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,560
From now on,
you and my husband don't count.

87
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,760
I'll speak to Michele.

88
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,960
- Lila, where are you going?
- Nowhere.

89
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,080
It's me.

90
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,280
Some blood came out.

91
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,720
Does that mean the baby is dead?

92
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,518
Who personifies love
that moves everything?

93
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,798
Angelica.

94
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,518
Angelica is
the pivotal character of the work,

95
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,920
everything rotates around her.

96
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,318
Rinaldo loves her in vain.
Orlando goes mad with jealousy.

97
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,318
It's as if there were a place

98
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,718
at the heart of which stands
a sensual, irresistible woman

99
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,718
who stokes passion in all men.

100
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,398
- And pain, too.
- Yes, pain, too.

101
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,678
But Ariosto conceives the moon
as the place

102
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,958
where everything
that has been lost on earth is kept.

103
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,760
Where the grief for those
we have loved in vain ends up.

104
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,198
Thank you, Greco.

105
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,000
I'd like to keep going,
but it's time to go home.

106
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,240
Go back to your place.

107
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,638
For the day after tomorrow,
"Orlando Furioso",

108
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,238
canto 35, reading and paraphrasing.

109
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,040
You may go.

110
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,440
Elena.

111
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,640
- What newspapers do you read?
- I don't know... Roma.

112
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,400
Take this one, I've read it.

113
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,118
I'll bring newspapers again,
so you can read them every day.

114
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,000
Thank you, miss.

115
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,880
PIAZZA DEI MARTIRI - NEW STORE
IN THE CENTER OF NAPLES

116
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,960
- Hi, Lenù.
- Hi.

117
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,038
Give me the satisfaction. Try it.

118
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,718
You try some, too.
You can see it's fresh milk.

119
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,398
<i>After the miscarriage,
there began a long period</i>

120
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,198
<i>when she stopped running around</i>

121
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,278
<i>and seemed determined
to compress her whole life</i>

122
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,358
<i>into the order of that space
fragrant with cheese,</i>

123
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,038
<i>filled with salami and bread.</i>

124
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,838
- Who wants more?
- 250 for me!

125
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,238
- Mamma, make sure you treat her well.
- Thank you.

126
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,518
Please.

127
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,078
Signora Maria,
your daughter-in-law's recovered.

128
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,278
You know what they say?

129
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,998
The Lord gives us children
and then takes them away.

130
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,478
So true...

131
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,280
Lenù, come here.

132
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,318
Enzo sent it,
he's in a remote place in Piedmont.

133
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,200
He's fine.

134
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,238
I'm glad, Enzo's cool.

135
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,280
Antonio sent a postcard to Lila
here at the store.

136
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,038
- He's not well, is he?
- No.

137
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,358
- Carmela, take care of the customers.
- Lenù, come with me.

138
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,798
- Signora, what else do you need?
- I took a bottle of Strega liqueur.

139
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,000
You take it a little too often.

140
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,158
Alfonso told me
you were looking for me.

141
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,800
Wait.

142
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,760
I wanted to show you this.

143
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,838
I've seen it.
Michele Solara got them to write it.

144
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,158
Did you see? He was here.

145
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,360
He's always here,
I don't understand why.

146
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,600
Read it out loud.

147
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,238
"The kindness, the sweetness,
the grace of the two seductive nereids,"

148
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,678
"Signorina Gigliola Spagnuolo
and Signorina Giuseppina Carracci,"

149
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,758
"marvelous maids in flower
who control the destiny of a business".

150
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,398
No, further down.

151
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,638
"The panel is a crude hotchpotch,"

152
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,638
"a discordant note
in a setting of majestic elegance".

153
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:32,878
Did you see who wrote it?
Donato Sarratore.

154
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,118
- Yes.
- And you have nothing to say?

155
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,558
- What can I say?
- Like father, like son.

156
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,718
And anyway, only he wrote the truth.

157
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,560
There's not a true word
in any of the other papers.

158
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,160
They were all paid for.

159
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,520
With this. Smell how it stinks.

160
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,760
- Lila, Mamma's here, she's arrived.
- Send her in.

161
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,278
- Giuseppina.
- Good evening.

162
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,358
- Hi, Lenù.
- Hi, Giuseppina.

163
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,720
- How are you?
- We get by.

164
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,918
- This is for you.
- You're such a dear.

165
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,318
There are things
to take to your husband in jail, too.

166
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,358
- May the Lord bless you.
- It's nothing.

167
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,760
Give me a kiss.

168
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,920
- I'll see you.
- Thank you again.

169
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,958
Carmela, I'll be right there.

170
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,038
Pasquale was always right,

171
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,038
everything here has been done
with Stefano's money

172
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,758
and Stefano made the money
starting with his father's.

173
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,158
Without the money made from
the black market and loan sharking,

174
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,438
neither this store
nor the shoe store would exist.

175
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,478
And that's not all, neither Stefano,
nor Rino, nor my father

176
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,078
would have sold a single shoe without
the help of the Solaras' contacts,

177
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,598
also loan sharks.

178
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,080
The Solaras and the Carraccis joined
forces to keep the money growing.

179
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:30,000
Therefore not even the money
Carmela and I earn is clean.

180
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,640
Money can never be cleaned.

181
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,600
Is it clear what kind of scam
I'm caught up in?

182
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,118
I don't like what I've done
and what I'm doing,

183
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,320
that's why I want to use
the money my way.

184
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,518
Remember, you have to pass
with an A average.

185
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,078
I put my heart and soul into it.
I'm doing well.

186
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,158
I know you've really knuckled down.

187
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,560
You've got to get it all
into that head of yours.

188
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,958
- Well?
- What?

189
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,280
They're for you, don't you want them?

190
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,798
Lila, you shouldn't have.

191
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,878
I ordered them for the start of school
but they only got here now.

192
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,958
- Thank you.
- They're new.

193
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,440
Enough with those tatty books
Miss Oliviero gives you.

194
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,880
Mario?

195
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,598
Please accompany my friend home,
her bags are heavy.

196
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,080
Very well, signora.

197
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,880
- Give these to your mother.
- Thanks.

198
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,400
I have to work.

199
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,798
Sorry, I forgot my keys.

200
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,558
Good evening, signora.
Where can I put them?

201
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,040
Put them on the table.

202
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,160
There.

203
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,280
Goodbye.

204
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,760
What's all this?

205
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,280
This is from Lila.

206
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,998
- A whole one?
- She gave me these too.

207
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,600
- What are they?
- School books for this year.

208
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,080
They smell nice.

209
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,320
They're brand-new.

210
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,960
They're new.

211
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,558
<i>From Christmas to Easter the Solaras
and the Carraccis made lots of money.</i>

212
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,918
<i>The new grocery store
and the old one yielded well,</i>

213
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,678
<i>the shoe factory
worked at full capacity.</i>

214
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,718
<i>The shoes designed by Lila
gained the approval of the well-to-do,</i>

215
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,320
<i>those who reach effortlessly
for their wallets.</i>

216
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,198
We need Lila,
or what's this meeting for?

217
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,878
We're here, isn't that enough?

218
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,438
We have to do this meeting
to figure out who's in charge.

219
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,078
- You already said that, shut up.
- I'll talk whenever I want!

220
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,718
No, now shut up!

221
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,158
We need new styles and Lila knows it,
why didn't she come?

222
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,278
I told you, she's not feeling well.

223
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,878
Me and Papa have already begun,
you'll see them soon.

224
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,438
Your sister does the good shoes.

225
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,998
If the shoes sell it's only thanks
to those who work here all day long.

226
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,078
Your wife is indispensable,
you have to make her come.

227
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,158
My wife spends all day
at the grocery store.

228
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,198
That's why the meeting is at lunchtime
when the shops are closed.

229
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,480
She needs to rest at lunchtime.

230
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,438
Your wife is wasted
at the grocery store.

231
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,998
Here she'd make in a month what would
take your sister and Gigliola 100 years.

232
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,960
Lila needs to command, to invent,
to design shoes.

233
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,958
She'll do what she wants, as usual.

234
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,318
Come, I need to explain
something to you.

235
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,720
Marcello.

236
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,478
See all the shoes in here?
We Cerullos make them!

237
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,998
If it wasn't for Michele,
you'd still be in the neighborhood.

238
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,038
Actually, it's thanks to my brother.

239
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,998
With respect, without the Solaras
your brother's a nobody.

240
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,040
He never needed anything,
without Michele you're a nobody!

241
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,758
You listen to me!
Who the fuck do you think you are?

242
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,318
The boss? You're nobody.

243
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,600
If I want I can send you back to
stuffing ricotta in the cannoli again.

244
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,760
What's going on? What's going on?

245
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,758
It's your fault, you've got a lighter
because you smoke in secret!

246
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,318
Did you do it on purpose?

247
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,358
Why don't you get it?
She's a wicked witch!

248
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,198
She lit the fire herself.

249
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,118
She wanted to burn me,
she wanted to kill us.

250
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,040
Pinù, you tell them.

251
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,318
Lila is capable of not getting pregnant.

252
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,960
And when it happened,
she let it slide out between her legs.

253
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,998
What the fuck are you talking about?

254
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,720
You'd better leave Lenù.

255
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,120
There's a wicked witch in here.

256
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,200
And now what will you do?
Will you still do drawings?

257
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,278
I don't want to draw a thing,

258
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,240
not so much as a sandal or a slipper.

259
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,318
- They'll get mad.
- What can I do about it?

260
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,838
- It's money.
- They've got money.

261
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,120
And it's already enough.

262
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,118
The truth is I tried.

263
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,798
- But nothing comes out anymore.
- Try again.

264
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,600
It's not the way it was when we were 12.

265
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,160
The things that came out of here,
don't anymore.

266
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,280
The smell of leather,
skins, revolts me.

267
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,398
I did it for you,

268
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,520
to show you that, although I didn't
go to school, I could do something.

269
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,680
It never ends.

270
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,480
I always have urges in my head.

271
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,160
I always have to prove
I know how to do things well.

272
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,518
When we opened the grocery store,

273
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,800
Stefano taught me
how to cheat on the weight.

274
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,398
At first I yelled at him
that he was a thief,

275
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,158
so this was how he made his money,

276
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,400
but then I wanted to show
I could cheat better than him.

277
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,680
And I came up with a hundred ways.

278
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,760
I cheat everyone, Lenù.

279
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,320
On the weight,
on a thousand other things.

280
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,120
I cheat the whole neighborhood.

281
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,360
Don't trust me.
Don't trust what I say and do.

282
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:30,078
I'm glad the photo
with the bridal dress got burned.

283
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,038
The wedding should have burned too.

284
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,838
The dress, the Solaras, the shoes...

285
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,720
Stand up.

286
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,880
Try to relax.

287
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,038
- What are you going to do?
- Cheat.

288
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,638
I'll get Rino to do the shoes.

289
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,638
If they go badly, I'll take the blame,
if they go well, I'll say he did them.

290
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,880
Are you crazy?

291
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,478
It suits you,

292
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,598
but not for an important party.

293
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,160
- It's important, right?
- How should I know?

294
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,198
My teacher stopped me outside school,

295
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,478
she said her kids were organizing
a party and she wanted me to go.

296
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,640
Then you have to go.

297
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,800
Try this on.

298
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,920
This is elegant.
They'll be elegant people.

299
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,440
I think it's elegant too.

300
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,680
- Where does this teacher live?
- On Corso Vittorio Emanuele.

301
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,440
- Does she have a sea view?
- I don't know.

302
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,760
- Are her kids still in school?
- I don't know.

303
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,520
No, that's it, I'm not going.

304
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,758
Take me with you.

305
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,720
- Stefano won't let you come.
- We'll see about that.

306
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,200
Tell me if you want to take me.

307
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,558
Of course I want you to come.

308
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,558
I could wear this.

309
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:50,000
- Don't you think it's a bit much?
- Is it a party or a wake?

310
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,358
What are you doing here?

311
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,358
What am I doing here?
Do I have to explain it to you?

312
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,198
- No, Stefano!
- You're here too...

313
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,678
- Everyone's going to find out anyway.
- What are you talking about?

314
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,238
Her brother brings Pinuccia
to do their stuff here.

315
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,718
- In this house! Who gave them the keys?
- It's my house, too.

316
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,838
Shut up, don't even breathe.

317
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,118
On account of doing filthy things,

318
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,358
Pinuccia's pregnant
and now they have to get married.

319
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,358
You know what really pissed me off?

320
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,598
When I slapped Pinuccia,
you know what she said?

321
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,278
"You're jealous because
I'm a woman and your wife isn't,"

322
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,720
"because Rino knows what to do
with a woman and you don't!"

323
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,280
Fucking hell! Damn it to hell!

324
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,358
Why do you have
to put me through this?

325
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,520
I better go out or I'll kill you!
But I won't give you that satisfaction!

326
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,278
You fucking bitch!
You're just a bitch!

327
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,040
Nothing but trouble!

328
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,240
So, will you take me?

329
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,638
<i>I feared her dress was too flashy,</i>

330
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,878
<i>but also that her beauty
would explode like a star</i>

331
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,798
<i>and everyone would scramble
to grab a fragment of it.</i>

332
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,638
<i>I feared she would speak in dialect,
say vulgar things,</i>

333
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,238
<i>but also that,
if she simply opened her mouth,</i>

334
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,558
<i>everyone would be mesmerized
by her intelligence</i>

335
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,958
<i>and Mrs Galiani herself
would fall under her spell.</i>

336
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,398
<i>I feared Mrs Galiani would realize
I was only a pale shadow of her.</i>

337
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:47,240
<i>She'd want to see her again, she'd
try to get her to go back to school.</i>

338
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,358
- I'll see you later.
- What time do I pick you up?

339
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,000
Midnight.

340
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,680
Lila!

341
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,118
I was thinking,
what if I come up with you?

342
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,120
I'll say hello, have a drink.

343
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,280
No, Stefano. They're Elena's friends,
I don't even know them.

344
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,680
Okay.

345
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,038
How did you convince him?

346
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,200
If I want something,
I just act like a whore.

347
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,198
Please, don't talk like that.

348
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,918
- Like what?
- Like you just did.

349
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,560
- Are you ashamed of me?
- No...

350
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,440
- You know what floor they're on?
- Third.

351
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,718
- Have you ever been in an elevator?
- No.

352
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,560
- It's better if we walk up.
- Why?

353
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,958
And what happens now?
What do we do?

354
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,918
You have to press 3.

355
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,280
- Shall I do it?
- Do it.

356
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,760
Good God!

357
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,518
- Hi.
- Hi.

358
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,558
I'm Elena,
one of Mrs Galiani's students.

359
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,518
- Elena?
- Yes.

360
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,158
I'm Armando, her son.

361
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:15,078
Mamma torments us with your essays,
I must have read them all.

362
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,960
Please, come in.

363
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,840
Come, I'll take you to my mother.

364
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,198
Elena, what a pleasure to see you.
I'm glad you came.

365
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,198
Thank you, your house is beautiful.

366
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,478
Thank you, if you like
I'll give you a little tour later.

367
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,718
I told her you always read us her
essays, that she's very clever.

368
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:03,278
- See? Our Elena is also very beautiful.
- Thank you.

369
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,720
There are lots
of interesting people here to meet.

370
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,720
I wanted to introduce you to my husband
but he's on shift at the hospital.

371
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,838
Is she a friend of yours?

372
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,158
Yes. This is my teacher.

373
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,998
This is Lila, we went
to elementary school together.

374
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,520
- Hi.
- Good evening.

375
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,840
Long friendships are important.

376
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,720
- Are you married?
- Yes.

377
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,560
- Are you Elena's age?
- Two weeks older.

378
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,678
- Have you introduced them to Nadia?
- No.

379
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,078
- What are you waiting for?
- They've just arrived.

380
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:50,798
Nadia's looking forward to meeting you.
This one's a rogue, don't trust him.

381
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,038
But she's a good girl.
I'm sure you'll be friends.

382
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,598
- You'll see, you'll like her.
- Let's go.

383
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,720
- Have fun.
- Thank you.

384
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,440
My sister ruined my childhood,
a pain in the ass for 16 years.

385
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,640
Nadia, come,
I want to introduce you to Elena.

386
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,720
- She's Elena, Mamma's student.
- Hi.

387
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,958
- I'm so pleased to meet you.
- Hi.

388
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,358
The things you write capture me.

389
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,878
I always ask Mamma
if you've written another essay.

390
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,240
Thank you, Nadia.
You're all so nice to me.

391
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,158
This is a friend of mine.

392
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,318
- Raffaella Carracci.
- Nadia, nice to meet you.

393
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,958
- Hi, Elena.
- Hi, Nino.

394
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,398
- You know each other?
- Yes.

395
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,040
We're from the same neighborhood.

396
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,680
Hi.

397
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,758
How was the trip to England?

398
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,840
Very interesting.
I want to go back soon.

399
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,478
- Let's dance.
- Lila, are you coming?

400
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,400
I don't feel like it.

401
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,438
You're Lila, right?

402
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:42,040
- I'm Nino Sarratore, remember me?
- Yes.

403
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,920
- You're not dancing?
- No.

404
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,480
Lila, come on!

405
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,720
Oh, God!

406
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,438
Sorry, we were...
She was looking for the bathroom.

407
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,720
- Yes, sorry.
- Excuse us.

408
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,840
Goodbye.

409
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,400
- Elena, your friend's in there.
- Thanks.

410
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,360
Lila, well?

411
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,198
I've been looking for you for an hour.

412
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,958
- I was here.
- Come to the terrace, everyone's there.

413
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,638
- Doing what?
- Talking, getting fresh air.

414
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,160
You go.

415
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,040
- Are you bored?
- No.

416
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,720
I'm looking at the books.

417
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,800
- Have you seen how many there are?
- Yes.

418
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,560
Come on.

419
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,000
- Hi, Greco.
- Hi.

420
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,278
The clash between rich and poor,
exploiters and exploited,

421
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,238
is no longer avoidable.

422
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,758
The new and decisive fact is that
the victims can't be intimidated

423
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,798
and they carry on their struggle.

424
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,958
The real problem is
that you, young people, think

425
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,118
that you can obtain everything
right away without sacrifices.

426
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:29,718
But to build a new world it takes time,
there has to be a plan.

427
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,958
The world doesn't change
with planning, it takes blood.

428
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,598
- Violence is necessary.
- You're wrong.

429
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,640
You know what you're lacking in?

430
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,198
Trust.
Without trust, things don't change.

431
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,558
The world already has the technical
and human capabilities

432
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,918
to end colonialism, hunger, war.

433
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,878
Look at what Danilo Dolci
is doing in Sicily, in Trappeto,

434
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,678
he went on a hunger strike

435
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,678
to protest against that child dying
from malnutrition...

436
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,278
- Benedetto Barretta, poor little thing.
- Isolated cases don't count.

437
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,998
Martin Luther King is an isolated case?

438
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,998
Or President Chehab, who reconciled
the Lebanese communities

439
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,678
after the crisis of '58?

440
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:17,358
It's also thanks to him that you can now
go to Beirut as if it were Paris.

441
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,878
What you call isolated cases are many
and they are a great force.

442
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:25,678
I like to imagine them
like a world peace brigade.

443
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,238
Not that again!

444
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,918
You just like the name
"world peace brigade".

445
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,798
Maybe you're right, I like the name.

446
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,518
Maybe because it makes me hope
for something good.

447
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,840
- Do you hope for something good?
- You're deluded, or you're afraid.

448
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,598
Nino's right.

449
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,798
We mustn't repeat the errors
of previous generations.

450
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,758
I don't want to live in a world
that's at war again.

451
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,238
Today war must be waged
on atomic arsenals.

452
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,400
It should be waged on war itself.

453
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,238
If we allow the use
of these weapons we're all guilty.

454
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,678
Much more than the Nazis.

455
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,358
There are tyrants
who still keep people enslaved.

456
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:17,398
The world urgently needs to be changed,
but it must be changed through peace.

457
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,758
I absolutely agree with you.

458
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,478
Try and get this rebellious,
restless hard head to understand.

459
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,078
Do you remember Quasimodo?

460
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:31,078
"Forget, o sons, the clouds
of blood risen from the earth,"

461
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,478
"forget the fathers..."

462
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,998
"Their tombs sink down in ashes,"

463
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,040
"blackbirds, the wind,
cover their hearts."

464
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,318
Exactly.

465
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:52,518
You're so good. Clever, brave.

466
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,238
They don't sound like brave words to me.

467
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:59,038
If you say something different
from others, you're more than brave.

468
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,358
...with neither victims,
nor persecutors,

469
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,078
neither servants, nor masters.

470
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:09,798
And to do this,
we have to do what Elena says,

471
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,878
wage war on the atomic arsenals.

472
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,518
I'm dead tired.

473
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,478
I called Stefano, he's downstairs.

474
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,238
Wait a bit longer.

475
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,878
No, enough, I'm sick of it here.

476
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,758
- Wait five minutes.
- No.

477
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,398
Our dear Christian Democrats
promise change,

478
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,640
but they can't even agree
amongst themselves.

479
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,678
Miss, they've come to pick us up.

480
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,680
- Go, Elena, don't worry.
- Thank you.

481
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,518
Bye, Nino. Bye, Nadia.

482
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,320
Bye, thank you.

483
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,158
What's the matter? What's wrong?

484
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:00,200
I've never been so bored
since I was born.

485
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,918
It would have been better
if we'd gone to the movies.

486
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:09,680
Even watching TV would have been
better than being with those snobs.

487
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:16,798
What a disgusting place!
A house full of old stuff.

488
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,038
Furniture from a hundred years ago,
the house is three hundred years old.

489
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,358
The books are covered with dust,
they're also really old.

490
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,638
None of them earned any of it,

491
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,000
they were born with that old stuff
so they think they're God Almighty.

492
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:38,038
They eat like this, they talk like this,
they move like this,

493
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,758
but not one of them
is capable of an original idea.

494
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,438
They know, they know,
but they don't know a thing.

495
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,040
You couldn't understand
a word they said.

496
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,158
And I don't think
they understood either.

497
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:56,078
Opening to the Left, atomic arsenals...

498
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,478
Next time don't take me,

499
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,800
take Pasquale,
he'll soon set them straight.

500
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:11,160
They're monkeys that piss and shit
in the toilet instead of on the ground.

501
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,958
But they've forgotten it,
that's why they think they're all that.

502
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:23,518
You too, be careful,
you're becoming the parrots' parrot.

503
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,638
You should have heard her,
with that voice...

504
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,358
Her and Sarratore's son, the same.

505
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,918
We have the technical capability...
Hunger here, war there...

506
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:39,640
Like Sarratore, you act the part
to be welcome in their house?

507
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,958
You leave us alone in our shit,
with our brains burning,

508
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,040
while you go "coco-rico"...

509
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,158
See him, Lenù?

510
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,080
Good or bad, I've got a man.

511
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,038
You know a lot of things,

512
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,040
but you don't know what this is like.

513
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:58,640
- Bye, Elena.
- Don't take it to heart, Lila's joking.

514
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:06,318
How clever you are!
How intelligent you are!

515
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,040
How brave you are!

516
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,120
Bye, Greco.

517
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,518
<i>The memory
of her sarcastic tone that night,</i>

518
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:31,598
<i>instead of fading, it amplified
and the bitterness grew stronger.</i>

519
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:36,078
<i>It seemed that nothing could justify
what she had done.</i>

520
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:40,838
<i>After school ended, I began working
in a bookstore in Port'Alba</i>

521
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,720
<i>and I disappeared from the neighborhood.</i>

522
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,398
This is the volume
on Kierkegaard and Nietzsche.

523
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,798
The other one I don't understand
what it's called.

524
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:00,078
"Sein und Zeit"...

525
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,240
I'm sorry, but I don't understand.

526
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:08,038
I asked for "Being and Time" by
Heidegger translated by Chiodi in 1953.

527
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,800
I'll get it for you, Professor.

528
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:15,078
- Here, this is it.
- That's the one.

529
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:18,200
Go and put out the books
that came in this morning.

530
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:23,398
This is the only authorized
Italian translation.

531
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,718
I have high regard for this publisher.

532
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,958
You're right, I knew I'd find it here.

533
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:33,278
I'm sure there'll be
more translations to come.

534
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,198
Let's hope so.

535
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,160
They take many important initiatives...

536
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,400
Elena, where are you going?

537
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,198
- Nino!
- Lenù!

538
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,838
- Where'd you come from?
- From that bookstore.

539
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:17,638
- We were looking for you.
- What?

540
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:22,038
We knew you worked in one of these
bookstores, but not which one.

541
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:24,478
We searched them all.

542
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,360
I was behind a bookshelf, but I saw you.

543
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:32,438
- Want to go to the movies with us?
- Thanks, but I can't.

544
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:36,918
- We'll drop by later.
- I have to go home.

545
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:40,998
- But a stroll in the neighborhood?
- Yes.

546
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,400
One of these days we'll come to you.

547
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,920
All right.

548
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,638
- Shall we go to the movies?
- Let's go.

549
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,240
- We'll see you. Bye.
- Bye.

550
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,120
Thank you.

551
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,478
<i>Not one of his features
resembled his father,</i>

552
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,638
<i>not his stature, not his face,
not his manner,</i>

553
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,118
<i>not even his voice or his eyes.</i>

554
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:12,518
<i>He was sweet, anomalous fruit.</i>

555
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,558
<i>How attractive he was
with his ruffled hair,</i>

556
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:19,160
<i>how unrelated he was
to any other form of male...</i>

557
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:44,198
Pinuccia, what a surprise!
Has something happened?

558
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,758
- Come in.
- No, I'm in a hurry.

559
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,958
There's no one here,
they've all gone to Mass.

560
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:53,440
I saw them. I brought
your invitation to the wedding.

561
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:58,998
It's only for you, we want you to come.

562
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,038
It's Stefano's fault.

563
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,758
Not only is he not buying me a house,

564
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,998
but seeing as he's paying for the dress,
the photographs and the reception,

565
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,158
half the neighborhood's not on the list.

566
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,798
Rino apologizes too,
but we can't invite your family.

567
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:16,158
Stefano says he's put all his money
in the grocery store and the shoe store

568
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,758
and now he's got nothing left.

569
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,678
Not to mention Rino,
he's a spendthrift.

570
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,238
- He's bought a car.
- Don't worry.

571
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:29,558
We wanted a wedding like Lila's
and a house by the railroad,

572
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:33,318
instead Mamma's giving us her bedroom.

573
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:37,478
Stefano acts broke with me
but squanders money on his wife.

574
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:41,160
- Sorry again.
- It doesn't matter, don't worry.

575
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,160
Elena!

576
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,400
Lenù!

577
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,518
Hi! What are you doing here?

578
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:18,560
- Come down. Let's go for a walk.
- Yeah, I'll be right down.

579
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:15,718
- Hi.
- Hi. What are you doing here?

580
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,880
I brought this for you to read.

581
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,320
Will you read it?

582
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,080
Of course.

583
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,080
Let's go.

584
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:55,638
It's schematic,
like Galiani and Armando.

585
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,040
But there are some good things in it.

586
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,958
I really mean it.

587
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,918
Mrs Galiani was fundamental for me too,

588
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,560
but she can't bear ideas
different from hers.

589
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:12,600
Take what you need,
but reason with your own mind.

590
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:20,560
If you like, show it to Lila too.

591
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,838
Where's Nadia?

592
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:31,918
Nadia's at home with some
of her father's friends.

593
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,158
She's going to Norway with them.

594
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,198
Are you going to Ischia
with your parents?

595
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,958
With my father?
Not even if they kill me.

596
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,478
I'm going to Ischia
but to a friend's house.

597
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,678
We have to study. You?

598
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:50,118
I don't know, I'm looking for a summer
job for when the bookstore closes.

599
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:53,718
- Why don't you come and visit me?
- How can I?

600
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,120
What's the big deal? Go on, come.

601
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:05,078
- I like talking to you.
- Me too.

602
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,720
And I want to know
what you think of the journal.

603
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,000
I haven't been here for ages.

604
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,398
- Shall we get a coffee?
- Yes.

605
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:23,278
Donato!

606
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,960
- Who's that?
- It's Melina, don't you remember her?

607
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,198
- Is she talking to me?
- I don't know.

608
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,040
Donato!

609
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:44,758
Why is she calling me "Donato"?
Do you think I look like my father?

610
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,958
No.

611
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,398
- Sure?
- Yes.

612
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,800
Wait for me, Donato!

613
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:57,280
- Maybe I'd better go.
- No, wait...

614
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,198

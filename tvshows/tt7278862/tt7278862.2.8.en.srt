1
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,760
And this is your bibliography, good.

2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,678
- All you have to do is get to work.
- I'm already doing it, professor.

3
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,038
And what would you like to do after?

4
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,238
- I'd like to teach.
- Good. That's an excellent idea.

5
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,640
In fall there'll be a civil service exam
for teachers' training college.

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,800
I'd actually like to try and embark
on an academic career.

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,120
I see.

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,118
Greco...

9
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,878
You're a good student, I hold you
in high regard. You've worked hard.

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,838
Thank you, professor.

11
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,000
But it's better not to run
before you can walk.

12
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,078
You see, each one of us is the result
of a long process of refinement

13
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,198
that often spans generations

14
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,918
and you have
definitely put in the effort,

15
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,880
but nature does not take leaps.

16
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,558
And then, I don't mean to offend,
but take your accent.

17
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,638
Yes, it has improved,

18
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,878
but it's a signal among the many
that don't favor you.

19
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,358
Just think how useful
your education could be

20
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,080
in training a new generation
of elementary teachers.

21
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,118
In any case,
let's take it one step at a time.

22
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,920
Let me read
some of your thesis soon.

23
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,478
<i>Everything Franco Mari had given me
was out of fashion,</i>

24
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,918
<i>and had grown old on my back.</i>

25
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,438
<i>I'd always be afraid,</i>

26
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,838
<i>afraid of saying the wrong thing,
of using an excessive tone,</i>

27
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,718
<i>of revealing petty feelings,
of not having interesting thoughts.</i>

28
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,360
Look who it is! Naples.

29
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,440
Naples! Remember to bring me the
sweater I left in your room last night!

30
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,640
- What do you want?
- I'm Pietro Airota.

31
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,758
- So?
- You're Elena Greco, right?

32
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,078
- What do you want?
- I see you all the time.

33
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,358
Well... I wanted to say
I'm sorry about before.

34
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,600
Those guys are boors
who don't respect anyone.

35
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,118
I was cowardly, I wanted to intervene
but I couldn't bring myself to.

36
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,918
- Intervene to do what?
- To defend your good name.

37
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,680
I don't have a good name.

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,840
- May I walk with you?
- Perhaps it's better than stalking me.

39
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,398
You're a brilliant student,
so many people say so.

40
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,998
- How old are you?
- Twenty-two.

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,038
- Are you writing your thesis?
- It's not finished.

42
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,958
Then I'll have to see
to its publication.

43
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,838
Publication?

44
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,198
If your thesis is good, they publish it.

45
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,358
I didn't know that. Is yours good?

46
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,118
I don't know.
I don't know if I'm any good.

47
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,560
I don't know if my thesis is valid.

48
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,758
I get good grades in the exams,

49
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,798
but that doesn't mean
that I'm clever or intelligent.

50
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,840
- What are you talking about?
- It's true.

51
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,318
Are all the theses
that come out well, published?

52
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,640
Yes.

53
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,518
I don't know if mine's interesting.

54
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,518
Everything's interesting
if you know how to approach it.

55
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,558
- What's it on?
- It's on Horace.

56
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,158
- Astronomy and astrology.
- Fascinating.

57
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,800
Really? Do you know Horace well?

58
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,320
- And I can keep going until you stop me.
- Bravo!

59
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,040
You could help me with my thesis.

60
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,598
- Are you going home at Easter?
- No.

61
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,720
- You never go back?
- I haven't been back in ages.

62
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,320
- Everyone leaves, what do you do?
- I study.

63
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,760
- Thank you for walking me home.
- I'm very glad to have spoken to you.

64
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,520
I'll see you soon.

65
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,158
- You mix in the right circles!
- What do you mean?

66
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,158
That's the son of Professor Airota.

67
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,358
- Who's that?
- He's a bigwig in the academic world.

68
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,920
His mother's important too,
it's a family that matters.

69
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,240
Don't let him get away.

70
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,998
<i>I was blocked. For a while,
I couldn't work on my thesis.</i>

71
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,560
<i>I stared at the pages in books
without seeing the lines.</i>

72
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,718
<i>I racked my brain about what to do.</i>

73
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,158
<i>Give up at the end,
return to the neighborhood,</i>

74
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,358
<i>graduate, teach in elementary schools?</i>

75
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,998
<i>Teacher. Miss Greco.</i>

76
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,398
<i>In the neighborhood I'd be seen
as someone important,</i>

77
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,240
<i>the porter's daughter who'd known
everything since she was small.</i>

78
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,840
You mustn't read, Elena.
You must study.

79
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,960
Philosophy, Latin...

80
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,758
...adventure novels,

81
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,518
the daily news, fashion magazines,
you must always study.

82
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,880
Always try to understand.
To understand...

83
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,240
Come.

84
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,318
<i>I'd mourn my time with Franco Mari
for the rest of my life.</i>

85
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,638
<i>How lovely those months,
years with him had been.</i>

86
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,758
<i>At the time, I hadn't realized
their importance</i>

87
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,238
<i>and now they made me sad.</i>

88
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,398
<i>The rain, the cold, the snow,</i>

89
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:20,038
<i>the springtime scents along
the Arno River, politics, literature...</i>

90
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,318
<i>His room at night, his body...</i>

91
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,800
<i>all gone.</i>

92
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,238
<i>I'm lying to myself, I thought.</i>

93
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,918
<i>Had it all been so wonderful?</i>

94
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:47,078
<i>Even then, I knew there was shame,
awkwardness, humiliation and disgust.</i>

95
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,918
<i>To accept, endure, force oneself...</i>

96
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,318
<i>Is it possible that even
happy moments of pleasure</i>

97
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,320
<i>don't bear closer inspection?</i>

98
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,040
<i>I don't know why I started writing
a story in the third person.</i>

99
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,038
<i>It took me 20 days
to write it, non-stop.</i>

100
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,518
<i>At the end, I reread a few pages,
but I didn't like it and I let it go.</i>

101
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,918
<i>Meanwhile, I realized I felt calmer,</i>

102
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,080
<i>as if the shame had passed
from me into the notebook.</i>

103
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,560
- Who is it?
- It's Bianca.

104
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,358
Hi.

105
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,678
There's a boy waiting for you
downstairs. I said I'd tell you.

106
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,398
- A boy?
- Yes.

107
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,800
See you.

108
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,198
Pietro!

109
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,198
- Elena! How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

110
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,518
- You?
- Fine.

111
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,478
My parents are here,
I'd like you to meet them.

112
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,718
Would you like to come to lunch with us?

113
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,998
- I have to get changed.
- You've got plenty of time.

114
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,878
Take your time, I'll wait here for you.

115
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,880
All right. All right, thanks.

116
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,838
Mariarosa, dear daughter,
I can't talk politics with you.

117
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,238
Because I'm a woman?
Because I'm young?

118
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,318
Because you're full of prejudice

119
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,638
and prejudice doesn't
allow you to think deeply.

120
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,438
I think if we listened a bit more
to the young, it could be useful.

121
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,718
Adele, you always say
what everyone is thinking.

122
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,518
Am I banal?

123
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,438
No, Mamma, you're not banal,
you're sensitive.

124
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,718
You like everyone.

125
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,680
My family's favorite game
is to gang up on me.

126
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,918
You won't admit that
you're trapped by interclassism.

127
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,480
- Professor Airota! How nice to see you.
- Hello, my dear fellow.

128
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,478
Signora Adele, my respects.

129
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,078
Your son is doing himself proud in Pisa,
but we knew he would.

130
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,360
- Good morning, professor.
- Good morning, professor.

131
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,838
Good morning.

132
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,118
The young lady is
a very capable student of mine.

133
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,998
Good.

134
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,278
We won't keep you
any longer, bon appétit.

135
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,758
- Bon appétit.
- The same to you.

136
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,238
Who's that?

137
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,038
A professor of Latin literature,
I think.

138
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,558
What were we saying?
You're anti-American.

139
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,918
And you, Dad?
Are you socialist and pro-American?

140
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,358
<i>That was Pietro's family,</i>

141
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,318
<i>they talked about everything,
they argued, but politely.</i>

142
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,878
<i>They never said anything
just for the sake of it,</i>

143
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,718
<i>they had big ideas,
big, real passions.</i>

144
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,398
<i>I wasn't real.</i>

145
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,438
<i>I observed them stupefied
by my own discomfort,</i>

146
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,158
<i>searching for something to say
to make me seem intelligent,</i>

147
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,800
<i>like Mariarosa.</i>

148
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,118
The Americans after Hiroshima

149
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,478
should have been tried
for crimes against humanity.

150
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,358
Bravo.

151
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,238
Congratulations!
You and Mariarosa are two of a kind.

152
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,438
Cultured youth,
rebellious young ladies...

153
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,758
The main thing
is not to think of rebellion

154
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,838
as rebellion, as an act
of opposition and that's all.

155
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,198
What are you doing, smoking?

156
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,998
A small act of opposition,
every so often.

157
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,238
Papa, Elena's working on her thesis.

158
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,598
Pietro told me
you're not even going home.

159
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,598
I'd like to do it in the next session.

160
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,038
- Can we do anything for her?
- No, thank you, Dad.

161
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,880
Elena's done everything on her own
and she is very proud of it.

162
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,798
Bye, see you soon.

163
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,038
Bye, Elena.

164
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,360
- I'll be right there.
- Goodbye.

165
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,280
Do you have to go, Pietro?

166
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,878
Did you enjoy yourself?
You swear?

167
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,200
Of course I enjoyed myself,
you're a really wonderful family.

168
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,400
- It's important for me.
- Thank you again for bringing me.

169
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,518
Why don't you come to Turin with us?

170
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,880
- Grab some clothes, I'll wait here.
- Are you crazy?

171
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,680
I've never liked anyone
as much as I like you.

172
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,600
I have to go.

173
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,000
I promise I'll be back soon.

174
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,320
- Bye.
- Bye.

175
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,920
- I'll be back soon.
- Yes.

176
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,278
<i>I graduated at the end of July
with the highest grades.</i>

177
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,878
<i>I avoided telling my parents,</i>

178
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,520
<i>fearing my mother
would feel obliged to come.</i>

179
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,800
<i>After so long,
I was truly pleased with myself.</i>

180
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,558
My father didn't go past
fifth grade elementary,

181
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,838
my mother stopped in second.

182
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:20,918
None of my forebears ever knew
how to read and write.

183
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:25,160
- You're right to be proud.
- It's a revolution, Pietro.

184
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,358
Everything was good
at the restaurant, wasn't it?

185
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,800
Delicious.

186
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,280
Are we engaged?

187
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,958
What do you mean?

188
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:47,838
Do you think this is an engagement?
Or not?

189
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,440
I don't know. Why do you ask?
What do you say?

190
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,160
For the past few months,
I've thought so.

191
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,760
But, if you have a different opinion,
consider it a graduation gift.

192
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,840
Are we engaged?

193
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,958
- Don't go.
- What will I do here?

194
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,000
How will I support myself?

195
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,840
I haven't been home
for a year and a half.

196
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,478
I'll wait for the civil-service exam.

197
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,040
Stay.

198
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,838
That's what north-south
engagements are like.

199
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,118
You'll go to Turin, I'll go to Naples.

200
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,078
- We'll love each other long distance.
- It won't be long, Elena.

201
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,478
- Two years.
- What do you mean, two years?

202
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,958
To establish myself at the university,
then we'll get married.

203
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,918
September 1969.

204
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,198
- You've already chosen the date?
- Yes.

205
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,440
Of course, September 1969 is perfect.

206
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,000
Then we'll decide the day together.

207
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,520
I have a gift for you, too.

208
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,598
- To thank you for looking after me.
- What is it?

209
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,878
It's a novel.
The only copy, my only attempt.

210
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,080
I wrote it all in one go,
I don't even know what I wrote.

211
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,038
I'll never write another one.

212
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:45,878
- There are even some racy pages.
- What does racy mean?

213
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,160
You'll see.

214
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:55,478
I'm trusting you, Pietro,
I don't dare let anyone read it but you.

215
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,560
- What's it about?
- Read it.

216
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,280
- Let's go to my place.
- Where?

217
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,798
To my room, in the college.

218
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,200
- You know it's not allowed.
- Is that a problem?

219
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,160
It's best if we call it a night.

220
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,398
Maria.

221
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,518
Maria! Pass me the bottle,
I want to drink.

222
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,720
- Hold on.
- Come on!

223
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,440
We're coming into Naples station...

224
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,358
What's all this?

225
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,078
You weren't expecting it, eh?
They're asphalting everything.

226
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,078
They're making a big road that
goes from here to San Giovanni

227
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,518
and maybe as far as Portici.

228
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,678
Now and then the state remembers us.

229
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,560
Maybe something will move
in this neighborhood.

230
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,160
Let's go.

231
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,400
Good morning, Gioacchino!

232
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,958
- Let's take the avenue.
- Why? We're going that way.

233
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,200
Can't I show off my graduate daughter
to the neighborhood?

234
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,118
- Good morning, Don Vittorio!
- Lenuccia's here!

235
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,720
- She's back from Pisa, she graduated!
- What a satisfaction!

236
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,918
- Good morning, Don Vittorio!
- Here's the graduate!

237
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,400
She can give us all lessons!

238
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,640
Don Ciro, Lenuccia's here!
A degree with the highest grade!

239
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,838
- Good morning, Donna Evelina.
- Good morning, welcome back!

240
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,398
Thank you.

241
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,038
Don Mario, good morning.

242
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,998
- How are things?
- All good.

243
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,438
I went to pick Lenuccia up
from the station, she graduated.

244
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,438
Congratulations!

245
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,918
Vittorio always said: "My daughter's
in Pisa and she studies every day."

246
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,478
You could tell
she had a scientist's brain.

247
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,718
I told her mother
she should continue her education.

248
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,998
- She's given me huge satisfaction.
- I'm so glad.

249
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,998
- And will she work now?
- I'm having her do the civil exam.

250
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,798
She'll get a job as a teacher.

251
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,398
The porter's daughter
who teaches children Italian!

252
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,318
Wonderful, I'm so pleased.

253
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,638
Congratulations again.
The graduate!

254
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,278
Ada showed up at her place to tell her.

255
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,958
Donna Rosa heard from Gigliola

256
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,438
that your friend told her:
"There's a kid involved. Get out!"

257
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:56,118
So Ada said: "No, there isn't just
one kid here, there's two kids."

258
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,038
Do you realize the situation
your friend has put herself in?

259
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,920
- And Stefano?
- Now he has two wives and two kids.

260
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,718
Mamma, can you have two wives?

261
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,640
What are you talking about!
Now Stefano's King Farouk!

262
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,158
- And Lila?
- She left home, you knew that.

263
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,038
- But I didn't know Ada was pregnant.
- Who knew it?

264
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,958
Gigliola who's the cashier
at the bar, just told us.

265
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,198
People talk and things come out.

266
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,718
- Where's Lila now?
- Who knows?

267
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,158
I only know she left
her husband and her home,

268
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,438
she's run off with her kid,
who knows where.

269
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,918
Is it true you're getting married, Lenù?

270
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,918
- Yes, but not right now.
- Didn't you see the ring he gave her?

271
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,680
His name's Pietro.

272
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,238
And when will the gentleman
make an appearance?

273
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,078
- We're not old-fashioned.
- Old-fashioned?

274
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,318
We don't even know
who you're marrying.

275
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,358
What do you want to know?

276
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,158
What he does, what he earns,
where you'll live after you're married.

277
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:12,118
For now he's an assistant, like
a professor, but he's not earning yet.

278
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,038
But he will earn.
They published his thesis.

279
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,558
He's well regarded in academic circles.

280
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,238
His family is very important in Turin.

281
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,358
- Maybe we'll go there to live.
- In Turin?

282
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,958
Yes, or somewhere else.

283
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,078
So, he's a professor but doesn't earn,
he's written a book but no one knows.

284
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,400
That's great.

285
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,718
Things don't always go the same way.

286
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,480
Out there, the world is evolving, it's
more complex than what you're used to.

287
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,238
I didn't understand a word,
but that means you're intelligent.

288
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,720
Leave her alone.

289
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,958
Papa got the pastries you like.

290
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,158
Gianni, get the pastries from the shelf.

291
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,278
A package came for you
from Miss Oliviero.

292
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,480
She's in Potenza with her cousin.

293
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:16,118
- It's already open?
- It might have been food.

294
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,640
- You never mind your own business.
- Get off my back.

295
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,918
There are my elementary school
report cards.

296
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,440
Miss Oliviero even kept
your report cards.

297
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,038
You made a pasta fit for a king.

298
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,918
I can still smell the pancetta
and tomatoes.

299
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,878
Lenuccia likes it, you know.

300
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,038
I made it with tomato paste
like my mother did.

301
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,798
I learned Mamma's recipes,
what's she learned?

302
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,318
She only knows how to study.

303
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,358
Poor professor! What a life
he'll have when he marries her!

304
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,800
You don't get it,
we're from another world...

305
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,120
What happened, Lenù?

306
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,918
- Miss Oliviero died a few weeks ago.
- I'm sorry, may she rest in peace.

307
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,958
She was old, don't be so dramatic.

308
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,118
You can't even leave the dead in peace!

309
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,798
- She saw to our daughter's education.
- She wanted to command in our home!

310
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,118
What would you have done
with our daughter?

311
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,718
I always knew how smart
my daughter was,

312
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,158
- I didn't need a teacher to tell me.
- She even sent her to Ischia.

313
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,600
To study?

314
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,920
NOTEBOOK
Elena Greco

315
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,600
THE BLUE FAIRY

316
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,200
WELL DONE!

317
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,798
VERY GOOD

318
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,800
BEAUTIFUL!

319
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:54,078
EXCELLENT!

320
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,118
<i>Already on the first page
I started to feel sick</i>

321
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,918
<i>and soon I was drenched in sweat.</i>

322
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,680
<i>Only at the end did I admit
what I'd realized after a few lines.</i>

323
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:12,760
<i>Lila's childish pages were
the secret heart of my book.</i>

324
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,198
Conditional sentences
express an impossible

325
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,678
or unattainable hypothesis.

326
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,358
As we can see in the examples,

327
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,358
it envisages the use
of the subjunctive in the apodosis

328
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,998
and the conditional in the protasis.

329
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,920
Give me an example of
an implausible conditional sentence.

330
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,598
If I was been...

331
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,438
If I was been a dunce!
If I had been, had!

332
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,438
Good thing you've got a fever,
you can revise with me.

333
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,758
Maybe you won't fail the year again.

334
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,958
The professor from Pisa has arrived!

335
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,558
We're back.

336
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,280
- Did you keep an eye on the sauce?
- Yes.

337
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,078
Lenù, the mailman brought
this letter for you.

338
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,200
It's from your fiancé.

339
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,280
Thanks.

340
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,598
- Aren't you going to read it?
- I'll read it later.

341
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,040
Elisa, come here.

342
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,958
Put the milk in the fridge
and the fruit in the bowl.

343
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,520
- Where are you going?
- I'm tired, I can't take any more.

344
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,278
- You're not going to open it?
- I want to finish up here.

345
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:34,118
No, go.
Don't worry, I'll finish it later.

346
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,358
You don't even know how,
it's all creased.

347
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,200
- Your father will throw this in my face.
- Thanks.

348
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:53,680
Get the tablecloth.
Get the plates, we'll set the table.

349
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,758
Mamma, I'm going out.

350
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,518
- Where are you going?
- To make a phone call.

351
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,520
You haven't been out for two months,
you go out now we're about to eat?

352
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,318
- Hi, Gigliola, I need to make a call.
- Lenù, you only show up now?

353
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,718
Marcello said you've been back for ages.

354
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,880
You're right, I've been busy at home.
We'll talk later.

355
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,640
<i>Yes? Who's speaking?</i>

356
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,958
- Hello, Pietro?
- <i>Elena!</i>

357
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,840
- <i>At last!</i>
- I read your letter.

358
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,918
- <i>Which one? I've written three.</i>
- The one where you talk about the book.

359
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,598
Is it true? Who wants to publish it?

360
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,958
<i>My mother's publishing house,
I gave it to her straightaway.</i>

361
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,878
<i>She was very enthusiastic.
You have to call them, it's important.</i>

362
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,678
- But did you read it?
- <i>Yes.</i>

363
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,318
And...?

364
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,678
- <i>It's good.</i>
- Is it good?

365
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,518
<i>It's good,
but I'm not a literary critic.</i>

366
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,878
<i>They want to publish it,
they asked if you've had other offers.</i>

367
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,958
What offers! I only gave it to you.

368
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,198
<i>It's just that...</i>

369
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,438
<i>If I can give you some advice,</i>

370
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,480
<i>I'd take out the racy bits.</i>

371
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:49,278
- No. I'm not taking anything out.
- <i>As you wish.</i>

372
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,558
<i>You haven't told me
if you're happy about it.</i>

373
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:56,958
Yes, I'm very happy.
But I'm confused, I need to think.

374
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,998
<i>All right, but call
the publishing house.</i>

375
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,678
<i>I wrote the number in the letter,
did you see it?</i>

376
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,158
Yes.

377
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,598
- <i>Don't forget to call.</i>
- All right.

378
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,240
- Bye.
- Bye.

379
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:27,118
- How much do I owe you?
- What do you owe? C'mon...

380
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,640
Thanks.

381
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,320
- They're publishing a book of mine.
- Are they paying you?

382
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,560
- I don't know. See you, thanks.
- Bye.

383
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,918
I need to talk to Lila,
where can I find her?

384
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,320
You'll need to ask Ada.

385
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,998
I'm serious, she knows everything.

386
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,158
Lila and Enzo left a note on the table
saying where they were going,

387
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,918
with the exact address.

388
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,838
- Is she at the grocery store?
- Yeah, but hurry, it's closing.

389
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,120
Thanks, Gigliola,
I'll come visit you soon.

390
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,880
Hi, Ada.

391
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,680
Lenù.

392
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,238
Your mother told me
you were in the neighborhood.

393
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:58,198
Lisa, this is Greco's daughter.
She graduated.

394
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,478
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

395
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,478
I'll see you after lunch. Don't be late,
we have to decant the oil.

396
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,478
Very good, ma'am, I'll see you later.

397
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,400
Goodbye.

398
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,800
- You look well.
- You look well, too.

399
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,800
Walk me home. The baby's
with our neighbor, she's in a hurry.

400
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,398
With all due respect for your friend,
I'm here from morning till night.

401
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,878
- I never have time to do anything.
- Gigliola said you know where she is.

402
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,320
- You want to go see her?
- Yes, I have something to tell her.

403
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,320
Come up, I'll give you the address.
We'll have coffee.

404
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,240
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

405
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,920
Good afternoon, Signora Rosaria.

406
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,158
- Has she eaten?
- Yes, she's been very good.

407
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,638
She drank all the milk from the bottle.

408
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,678
- Have you seen this little one?
- She's so beautiful.

409
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,878
'Cause she resembles me
more than her father. Her name's Maria.

410
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,638
Will I see you tomorrow morning?
Please, don't be late.

411
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,318
I have to make deliveries.

412
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,680
- Then you can do a half day on Friday.
- All right, don't worry.

413
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,160
- Lenù, shall we have a coffee?
- Yes.

414
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,438
- How's Antonio?
- Antonio's in Germany.

415
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,360
He works for the Solaras.

416
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,918
Those lowlifes.

417
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,798
They cozy up to Stefano
but they want to take everything.

418
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,198
- He works for the Solaras?
- For a long time.

419
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,320
We never hear from him,
he doesn't tell us anything.

420
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,200
Do you smoke?

421
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,960
I've taken up the vice.

422
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,478
Lenù, there's a lot you don't know.

423
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,440
When I found out I was pregnant
to Stefano, I showed up here.

424
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,238
Still in my work smock.

425
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:35,918
Lila opened the door,
she looked at me and said...

426
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,040
- Has something happened?
- Nothing you don't already know.

427
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,480
What a pigsty.
This is how you make him live?

428
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,520
Don't you know how to do anything?

429
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,000
From tomorrow
I'm coming here to clean.

430
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,040
Do you know who the White Lady is?

431
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,600
With everything you know,
you don't know who the White Lady is?

432
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,998
She's Coppi's mistress.

433
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,798
Mistress... someone who loves
because she is truly loved.

434
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,838
I know who she is.

435
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,238
Yes, but I'm not like her,
I'm more modern.

436
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,758
I don't bend.

437
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:32,358
I discovered there's something
called the Sacra Rota.

438
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,758
It means that even God agrees
to dissolving marriages

439
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,760
when another love is stronger.

440
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:44,400
Stefano's told you a thousand times
how to make the bed, but you won't.

441
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:54,158
You gotta get outta here
or I'll kill your kid.

442
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,240
You're behaving like your mother.

443
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,640
Sit down, I'll make you a chamomile.

444
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,438
You're saying I'm crazy?

445
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,838
That I'm crazy like Mamma?
You gotta get out of the way.

446
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,080
You have a chamomile!

447
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,840
<i>She took the baby out to get some air.</i>

448
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,160
<i>She left me in the house
to do housework.</i>

449
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,558
That evening I ran to Stefano
as he was closing the store

450
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:55,000
and I told him I'd been to his house
and told Lila about us.

451
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,560
Make me a chamomile.

452
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,320
The kid's handsome.

453
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,518
- He's the spitting image of Stefano.
- No.

454
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,720
- He has his eyes and mouth.
- That's not true.

455
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,958
If you have to read
your books, go ahead,

456
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,918
I'll take care of Rinuccio
and the house.

457
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,918
See how well I cleaned?

458
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,118
Do what you want,
but don't go near the kid.

459
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,320
I won't do anything to him, don't worry.

460
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,880
Lila...

461
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,160
I'm pregnant.

462
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,080
What did you say?

463
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,560
It's true.

464
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,160
- To Stefano?
- Of course.

465
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,320
Does he know?

466
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,480
No.

467
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:06,080
- Get out.
- No.

468
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:11,920
- What's going through your brain?
- I'm staying here.

469
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,440
- You want to drive me crazy.
- Then there'll be two of us.

470
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,078
You'll ruin me.
It's not true that you love me.

471
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:44,078
You'll make me lose all my customers.
Do you want to see me broke?

472
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,680
You know the situation's
already difficult.

473
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:52,598
Please, tell me what you want,
I'll give it to you.

474
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,080
I want to be with you forever.

475
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:02,520
I want to be with you forever too.
But not here.

476
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,958
- Here.
- This is my home.

477
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,160
Lila's here, the baby's here.

478
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,840
From today, so am I.
I'm pregnant.

479
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:11,160
I know I behaved like a madwoman,
but Enzo and Lila were both crazy, too.

480
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:18,518
- You know what Lila did?
- She left everything here.

481
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,640
Even her jewelry.

482
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,998
They left this before they went.

483
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,678
They went to live
in San Giovanni a Teduccio.

484
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,760
A shithole...

485
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,118
If you go there, tell Lila

486
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,838
that I don't stop Stefano
from seeing his son,

487
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,958
but he's got too much to do,
he doesn't have time.

488
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,360
Even though he's sorry,
he can't make it.

489
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,878
Tell her also that the Solaras
are dangerous people.

490
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,358
Especially Michele,
he never forgets anything.

491
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,080
Tell her she needs to watch out,
she mustn't trust anyone.

492
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,040
Yes.

493
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,440
Maria's woken up.

494
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,760
NO. 48 VIA VIGLIENA, FOURTH FLOOR

495
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,358
Keep your hands to yourself, pig!

496
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:05,640
- What's your problem?
- This city will never change.

497
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,118
- Excuse me, Via Vigliena?
- Down there on the left.

498
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,680
Thank you.

499
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,758
Excuse me, who are you looking for?

500
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,518
Scanno. Cerullo.

501
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,278
- You looking for Lila?
- Yes.

502
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,320
Just a minute. Titina!

503
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:47,038
- What is it?
- This young lady's looking for Lila.

504
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:51,518
Thanks, Filomena.
Lila's not here.

505
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,958
- Enzo?
- No. Who are you?

506
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,198
I'm a friend, Elena Greco.

507
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,358
- Auntie Lenù!
- So, there you are!

508
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:04,238
Rinuccio, how you've grown!
Do you remember me?

509
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,800
Yes.

510
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,398
Can I show Auntie Lenù the house?

511
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,238
- So you know this lady?
- Yes.

512
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,758
Go, but hurry up,
the pot's on the stove.

513
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,120
- Yes.
- Bye...

514
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,320
Enzo sleeps here.

515
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:35,120
- This is the kitchen.
- What else is there?

516
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:44,678
Mamma sleeps here.
And I sleep here.

517
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:47,238
- Did you do these drawings?
- Yes.

518
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,880
They're beautiful.

519
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,880
What a lovely house.

520
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:08,040
- Rinuccio! Rinù!
- We're here.

521
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,518
Come on, it's ready.

522
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,998
- I'll go wash my hands.
- Good boy.

523
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,958
See how clever he is?
He's a born professor.

524
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:22,958
Come in and eat something
with us if you want.

525
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,038
No, thank you, I'm not hungry.
What time does Lila get back?

526
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,838
- Never before eight.
- And the boy?

527
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,798
He stays with me, I'm always on my own.

528
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,918
We play here, we eat there,
we spend all day together.

529
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:39,718
- Lila works for the Soccavos.
- Soccavos? With the salami factory?

530
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:43,358
- I know Bruno, the son.
- They're not nice people.

531
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,398
Father, grandfather, grandson...
They're all scum.

532
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,120
They made money and have forgotten
they were once bums.

533
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:56,040
- How long will it take to get there?
- Twenty minutes, I'll show you.

534
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,400
SOCCAVO SALAMI FACTORY

535
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:45,318
- Can I help you, miss?
- I'm looking for Cerullo, I'm a friend.

536
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:49,478
- She's working, you can't go in.
- I know Bruno Soccavo.

537
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,798
- Bruno Soccavo?
- Yes.

538
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,798
Let me speak to him.

539
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,918
Signor Bruno hardly ever
comes to the factory.

540
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:00,198
Call him at home, I'll wait here.

541
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:04,680
I'm a custodian, how can I call
Signor Bruno at home?

542
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,918
Your friend's down there,
right in front of you.

543
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,040
In the stripping room.

544
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,998
Is this the stripping room?

545
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,198
- Who are you looking for?
- Cerullo.

546
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,158
- Cerullo?
- Yes.

547
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:50,198
- She's in the mixing department.
- They told me she was here.

548
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,838
They moved her
to the mixing department.

549
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,918
- Where's that?
- Right in front of you.

550
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,478
Or try the stuffing room,
they're always moving her.

551
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,638
- Is she a friend of yours?
- Yes.

552
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,598
- Will it offend you if I say something?
- No, go ahead.

553
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,840
She's a pain in the ass.

554
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:03,718
- What are you doing here?
- Your neighbor told me you worked here.

555
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:08,438
You look good, Lenù. Let's go outside.

556
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:11,718
- Your friend can't be here.
- I'll see her out and be right back.

557
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,880
- Well, hurry up.
- I said I'll be right back!

558
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:25,240
- Did you graduate?
- Yes.

559
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,720
But something even better
has happened.

560
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,920
I wrote a novel
and they're publishing it.

561
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,600
I'm happy for you.

562
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:01,080
- What have you done to yourself?
- Nothing.

563
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,758
Stripping meat ruins your hands.

564
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,078
- You strip meat?
- They put me where they like.

565
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:13,078
- Speak to Bruno.
- He's the biggest shit of all.

566
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:16,398
He only comes here
to see who he can fuck.

567
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,800
- Lila!
- It's the truth.

568
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:26,238
- You're not doing well here?
- I'm fine.

569
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:30,960
When they put me in the cold rooms
they pay me ten lire more.

570
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:41,440
Lila... Miss Oliviero died.

571
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,720
She was ill, it was bound to happen.

572
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:57,160
- She let me have "The Blue Fairy".
- What's "The Blue Fairy"?

573
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,480
The book you wrote when you were ten.

574
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:12,240
- That's what we called it.
- That was a long time ago.

575
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,400
- Do you have a fever?
- No.

576
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,838
I was a presumptuous kid.

577
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:43,518
The story's still beautiful today.

578
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,560
The teacher wrote that in it.

579
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,960
I realized I'd always kept it
in my mind.

580
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:56,280
- That's where my book comes from.
- Then whoever printed it, is crazy.

581
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:09,080
- Cerullo! Will you get back to work?
- Coming.

582
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,518
I saw Rinuccio, he's so cute.

583
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:21,718
Your neighbor seems to be
a good woman.

584
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,960
I'm glad you found him so well.

585
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:30,000
- Enzo?
- He's kind, he's good.

586
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:36,398
He's very smart, he knows so many
things. And he studies at night.

587
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,038
- What does he study?
- Mathematics.

588
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,758
- Enzo?
- Yes.

589
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,240
Programming languages.

590
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:49,800
At night, after the baby
goes to sleep, Enzo studies.

591
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,200
- Do you study too?
- I keep him company.

592
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,598
He's tired and if he's by himself
he falls asleep.

593
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,438
But together it's great.

594
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,920
I'll say something,
he'll say something else.

595
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:13,920
- Do you like living with him?
- Yes.

596
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:17,838
Will you have kids?

597
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,798
- We're not together.
- You're not?

598
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,760
I don't feel like it.

599
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,040
- And him?
- He's waiting for me.

600
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:36,838
- Maybe you see him as a brother.
- No. I like him.

601
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:41,078
So? I don't know.

602
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,000
You still there, Cerullo?

603
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,398
Watch out for him, he's capable
of saying you stole a mortadella

604
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,680
so he can search you
and put his hands on you.

605
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:28,280
I'll be back, I don't want to lose you.

606
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,480
I don't want to lose you either.

607
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:05,238
DIGRESSION

608
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:11,718
In conclusion, Miss Greco not only
tells a story of female misery,

609
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:17,958
or of a coarse adolescence,
rudimental, without thought...

610
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:21,358
The theme is this, apparently,

611
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:26,038
but the writer, although very young,

612
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,480
is a cultured author.

613
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:33,478
She is able to govern
her young characters

614
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:38,758
and the plebeian world
in which they move,

615
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:43,558
with an often surprising shrewdness,

616
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:46,080
with a very dense lexicon.

617
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,760
Can you tell us
where you drew your inspiration?

618
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,998
Actually, that's not an easy question.

619
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,720
And so...

620
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:08,638
I think whoever has written
a book should not say much,

621
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,760
I perhaps...

622
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,238
Good.

623
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:22,638
The author naturally doesn't wish
to share her process with us.

624
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:25,960
We critics are the ones
who have to slog away.

625
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,200
Let's see if there are any questions.

626
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,078
Yes.

627
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:37,478
I don't agree with Professor Tarratano.

628
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:41,238
This text may have had
a raison d'être ten years ago,

629
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:47,678
but today, although written by the pen
of a charming young lady,

630
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,318
it seems dated.

631
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:53,438
Are we still telling stories
about the wretched?

632
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,438
That is, wretched women?

633
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:00,958
I leafed through the book,
it is a rather naive first attempt.

634
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,158
But I found it rather unpleasant
that to enliven stale material,

635
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:09,718
the author resorts to some pages...

636
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:12,478
let's call them Boccaccio-esque.

637
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:15,078
Or perhaps I should say obscene.

638
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:18,238
I'm referring, obviously,
to that chapter

639
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:21,558
about the summer on Ischia
and the carnal violence.

640
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:28,400
You will recall, I trust, how
Manzoni masterfully avoids vulgarity.

641
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:32,278
"The unfortunate girl replied..."

642
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:35,958
There, next time, bear that in mind.

643
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,720
- Allow me to say to you...
- Excuse me.

644
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:46,838
Next time, read something
more recent than "The Betrothed"

645
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:50,198
and come back
to apologize to Miss Greco.

646
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:56,238
But for now, I'd like to tell you
what I found unpleasant:

647
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:00,720
your narrow-mindedness
and the fact that you're not ashamed.

648
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:08,478
I did not leaf through
Miss Greco's book, I read it.

649
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:12,438
It is a courageous story,
of great modernity.

650
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:14,680
So, I should like to give you
some advice.

651
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:20,078
When you have caught up,
don't leaf through it.

652
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:21,400
Read it.

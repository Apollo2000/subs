1
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,000
He smoothed down his hair!

2
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,400
He wobbled his head like this.

3
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,318
You thought the same thing?

4
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,520
No, not me!

5
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,678
It must be lovely to sleep
in a huge bed, in a big luxury hotel.

6
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,158
- If you sleep!
- Why, what would you do?

7
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,238
- On your wedding night?
- Take a shower.

8
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,678
- And then?
- Then I'd take a bath.

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,838
- And then?
- I'd look at the view.

10
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,678
There must be an ending.
And what happens on a wedding night?

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,678
- Pasquale, I'll tell you at home.
- What would you know?

12
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,478
- Did you tell her?
- You're out of your mind?

13
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,478
You're a lost cause.

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,598
Lila's hat was kinda weird...

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,798
She acts the lady and she's wrong,
she looks ridiculous with a hat.

16
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,478
She doesn't need a hat,
she doesn't need anything.

17
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,718
- She's more a lady than the ladies.
- But it's the fashion. It looks good.

18
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,518
After the reception, the bride puts
on her hat and going-away outfit.

19
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,158
But they're only going to Amalfi,
it's not even two hours by car.

20
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,638
Pasquale, if someone loves me
and marries me,

21
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,080
I'd go on a honeymoon around
the block, with or without a hat.

22
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,638
They left in a hurry,

23
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,678
it was still daylight,
the reception wasn't even over.

24
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,438
And we got kicked out!
We wanted to close the joint!

25
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,120
Obviously they had stuff to do.

26
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,398
Antonio, what's wrong?

27
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,640
Why the long face?
You didn't like the wine?

28
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,000
- The food didn't go down well?
- Pasquale, don't bust my ass.

29
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,918
<i>They were so engrossed
by their need to fall in love</i>

30
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,358
<i>that none of them noticed
Marcello Solara's vendetta.</i>

31
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,758
<i>Lila reappeared in her going-away outfit
as if nothing had happened.</i>

32
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:34,558
<i>She had handed out the wedding favors
and left with her groom.</i>

33
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,918
<i>I thought if she had overlooked
that betrayal</i>

34
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,840
<i>it meant she loved him madly
like in the photonovels.</i>

35
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,638
Pasquale, stop playing
the racing driver with the boss' car!

36
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,438
My stomach's all upset.

37
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,238
- I like it when you go fast like that.
- Do you like it?

38
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,080
- What's gotten into Antonio?
- He's been like that all day.

39
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,798
- Move over.
- Her too, they're always like that.

40
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,720
They didn't get to enjoy the reception.

41
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,558
- Antonio! Can we talk?
- What do you want?

42
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,358
- Can't you see I'm with you?
- Liar!

43
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,958
If Sarratore hadn't gone
you would have left me there.

44
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,478
Because of you, my mother would have
slapped me in front of everyone!

45
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,878
You only think about yourself.

46
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,358
You made me swear to stay by your side.

47
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,278
- Let go of me!
- Look me in the eye!

48
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,958
You treated me like an asshole.

49
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,438
You talked with the poet's son
the whole time, you humiliated me.

50
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,718
You made me lose face. Why?

51
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,838
'Cause you're educated and I'm not?
'Cause I don't get things you say?

52
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,878
It's true, sometimes
I don't get them... Blast it!

53
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,118
- Lower your voice.
- Look me in the eye!

54
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,038
You think you can push me around?

55
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,918
You think I'm not capable
of calling it quits? You're wrong.

56
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,438
You know everything,
but if I say let's get together

57
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,838
and then I hear you're seeing
that dickhead Nino Sarratore,

58
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,798
I'll kill you.

59
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,720
Lenù, I'll kill you!

60
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,878
- You hurt me.
- Think about it.

61
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,840
Let's break up now.

62
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,960
Let's break up right now.
It's better for you.

63
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,280
Well?

64
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,758
- Come with me.
- Where?

65
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,638
- Come.
- Where are you taking me?

66
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,320
Where are we going?

67
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,918
<i>I wanted to sink back
into the neighborhood,</i>

68
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,358
<i>I wanted to ditch school,
notebooks full of exercises.</i>

69
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,078
<i>Exercising for what, after all?</i>

70
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,038
<i>What was I compared to her
in her wedding dress?</i>

71
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,320
<i>To her in the convertible,
in the blue hat and pastel suit?</i>

72
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,318
<i>I wanted to be penetrated
and tell Lila, when she returned:</i>

73
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,358
<i>"I'm not a virgin anymore either.
What you do, I do."</i>

74
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,400
<i>"You can't leave me behind."</i>

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,680
- Lenù, tell me you love me.
- Yes.

76
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,360
- Tell me.
- Yes.

77
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,840
Wait.

78
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,478
- Let's do it.
- Yes.

79
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,560
- Yes?
- Yes.

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,880
Lenù, don't do that,
you're driving me crazy.

81
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,398
No, Lenù.
I don't want to do it like this.

82
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,158
I want to do it,
but the way it's done with a wife.

83
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,600
And not here.

84
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,280
Because you and me are getting married.

85
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,480
Right, Lenù?

86
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,200
Shall we get married?

87
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,318
- Who have you been with?
- Ada and Carmela.

88
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,638
What are you talking about?

89
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,158
- You're not seeing Melina's son!
- Leave me alone!

90
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,440
That's not why we let you study!

91
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,160
I quit, I'm not going to school anymore!
I'm sick of it!

92
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,720
Enough!

93
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,800
- What's happening?
- Your silly bitch of a sister!

94
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,318
<i>I was so exhausted that even if I tried
to rest, I couldn't shake it off.</i>

95
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,958
<i>I didn't go to school for a week,
I wandered around the city.</i>

96
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,958
<i>Why bother studying,</i>

97
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,880
<i>if Nino hadn't published my article
and I'd lost his respect?</i>

98
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,000
One ticket.

99
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,680
Thank you.

100
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,240
Lenù!

101
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,878
Weren't you ill? You're a liar.

102
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,158
You got me to tell Galiani
you had a fever, yet here you are.

103
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
When are you going back to school?

104
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,080
- What for?
- What are you saying?

105
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,638
I'm marrying Antonio

106
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,360
and I'll find some job
in the neighborhood.

107
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,278
So it's best if I drop out.
I don't want to waste any more time.

108
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,480
Come back to school, please.

109
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,520
I'm not well.

110
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,198
Lila and Stefano are back.

111
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,280
- What?
- A few days ago.

112
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,240
Lila didn't tell me anything.

113
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,840
Lenù!

114
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,838
- Hi, Pasquale.
- What are you doing here?

115
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,078
You know where Lila lives?

116
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,720
In that building, on the third floor.

117
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,918
You've already been to visit?

118
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,638
I should show up
at a married woman's house?

119
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,998
- If she wants to, she'll come see us.
- Pasquale, work!

120
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,400
- Bye, Lenù.
- Bye.

121
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,040
- Who is it?
- Elena.

122
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,000
Lila...

123
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,198
- When did you get back?
- A few days ago.

124
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,400
- Why didn't you come and see me?
- Come in.

125
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,200
I'll show you the house.

126
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,040
This is the living room. See,
I still have to put away all the gifts.

127
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,880
Do you like it?

128
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,160
This is the kitchen.

129
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,558
- Nice, isn't it?
- Yes.

130
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,600
We'll have coffee later.

131
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,440
There's even a telephone.
This is the guest room.

132
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,880
And this is the bedroom.
Nightstands, the writing desk.

133
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,760
The balcony's so big.

134
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,440
Come and see how beautiful
the bathroom is.

135
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,880
There's a tub with a shower.

136
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,160
Whenever you want
to take a bubble bath, come over.

137
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,878
There's even a bidet.
You sit and wash yourself.

138
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,360
- Lila...
- Come to the kitchen, I'll make coffee.

139
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,640
- Do you like my new house?
- Yes.

140
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,798
- Why didn't you tell me you were back?
- I didn't want you to see me.

141
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,158
The others can see you but I can't?

142
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,480
I don't care about them,
but I do about you.

143
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,200
Turn around.

144
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,680
What happened to you?

145
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,758
I want to get out.

146
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:10,560
I can't sit in this car with you,
I can't breathe the same air as you.

147
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,080
- I said stop. Stop the car!
- What are you doing?

148
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,400
Listen carefully.

149
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,838
There are good reasons
for what happened.

150
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,638
The Solaras are the only ones
who can save us, all right?

151
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,398
If they're against us
we don't sell the shoes.

152
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,598
They can get the shoes displayed
in the finest stores in Naples.

153
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,478
- I had to do it, absolutely.
- What the fuck do I care?

154
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,958
What I need is what you need,
you're my wife.

155
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,078
Me?

156
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,478
I'm nothing to you anymore.
Nor are you to me.

157
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,638
Let go of my arm.

158
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,158
Your father, your brother
are nothing to you either?

159
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,558
Wash your mouth out when you mention
them. You're not fit to name them.

160
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,718
And who made the deal
with Silvio Solara?

161
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,560
Who shook his hand?
Now you listen to me.

162
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,638
It was your father who made
the deal and it wasn't easy

163
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,118
because Marcello was furious with you,
your family and your friends.

164
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,598
He says it was Enzo, Pasquale
and Antonio who burned his car.

165
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,518
You know who convinced him?

166
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,560
Your brother Rino.
What do you have to say now?

167
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,918
When Marcello asked
for the shoes you designed,

168
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,038
Rino said he could have them.

169
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,958
What was I supposed to do?

170
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,078
Fight with your family,

171
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,478
go to war against your friends
and lose all the money I invested?

172
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,158
You treated me like a rag
for wiping the floor.

173
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,838
You're a huge asshole.

174
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,958
Now take me home and tell them
what you told me.

175
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,440
Shithead!

176
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,960
See what the fuck you make me do?
Don't you realize you go too far?

177
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,960
Goddamnit...

178
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,440
We got it all wrong.

179
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,358
We haven't got anything wrong.

180
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,160
We just have to get
a few things straight.

181
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,718
Now you are Signora Carracci
and you do what I say.

182
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,958
Marcello Solara revolts me too.

183
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,038
When I think of the things
he said about you,

184
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,518
I want to stick a knife in his gut.

185
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,240
But if Marcello makes my money grow,
he becomes my best friend.

186
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,878
Understand?

187
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,158
If the money doesn't grow,
no more car and clothes.

188
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,478
We lose the house too,
and everything that's in it.

189
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,158
We'll end up beggars
and our kids will grow up beggars.

190
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,918
Is that what you want? Look at me.

191
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,840
Look at me!

192
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:26,358
If you ever dare
speak to me like you just did,

193
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,238
I swear I'll ruin
that beautiful face of yours.

194
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,240
So you won't be able to even stick
your nose outside.

195
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,960
Is that clear?

196
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,240
Is that clear, Lila?

197
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,758
Good evening.

198
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,198
Carracci.

199
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,998
- The newlyweds... Congratulations!
- Thank you so much.

200
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,558
Your first time on the Coast?

201
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,638
The first time we've stayed over,
I've always done day trips.

202
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,358
We've reserved Room 448 for you,
it's our best.

203
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,960
- Your ID, please.
- Lila, your ID.

204
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,398
Carmine!

205
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,040
I'll just register you
then give them back.

206
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,638
Good evening.

207
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,398
- I'll do it.
- No, leave it.

208
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,238
- I'll help you.
- I can manage on my own.

209
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,360
As you wish. Follow me, please.
I'll show you the way.

210
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,920
Please.

211
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,280
There's a magnificent terrace.

212
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,880
Lila, look at the seagulls!

213
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,158
The bottle is compliments of the
management for the newlyweds.

214
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,438
On the left is the bathroom, the closet.

215
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,920
Anything else you may require,
just pick up the phone.

216
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,320
- I put the keys there.
- Very good, thanks.

217
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,598
- You need anything else?
- No, that's all.

218
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,200
- So I should go?
- Yes.

219
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,560
- Here.
- Thank you.

220
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,518
Good evening.

221
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,640
Lila, come and see
how beautiful it is outside!

222
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,120
Smell the fragrant air.

223
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,840
We're so high up!

224
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,320
Wow, what a great view!

225
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,158
But it's a little chilly.

226
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,080
- Shall we get a cocktail and go eat?
- Yes!

227
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,600
- Aren't we getting changed?
- I'm going like this.

228
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,640
Isn't the pianist good?
Great voice, too.

229
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,398
You don't know what you're missing.

230
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,160
I don't usually like shrimp,
but these are special.

231
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,598
The fish is so fresh.

232
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:07,398
Business is doing well,
we can have what we want.

233
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,758
Of course, it would do better
if we sold coffee,

234
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,360
but we'd be stepping
on the Solara's toes, better not.

235
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,360
You're not drinking?

236
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,120
Waiter! Thank you.

237
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,278
Lila...

238
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,158
You know those stores
downstairs at our building?

239
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,998
I thought of buying them
to open a new grocery store.

240
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,440
What do you think?

241
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,558
Money's starting to circulate,
people want to spend.

242
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,598
For this store I want
the best suppliers, quality stuff.

243
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,440
It doesn't matter if it costs us more.
You get it?

244
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,640
Are you still mad about before? Lila...

245
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,358
You don't know how much I love you.

246
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,878
I spent an arm and a leg
to come here, but it's worth it.

247
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,518
That's what our first night deserves.

248
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,118
You can't imagine how much I want you

249
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,000
and for how long
I've been waiting for tonight.

250
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,078
May I?

251
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,318
- Thank you, this one is good.
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.

252
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,278
All delicious, compliments to the chef.

253
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,640
Bring us the dessert trolley, please.
Lila, a nice dessert?

254
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,560
Lila?

255
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,960
Lila? Are you getting ready?

256
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,280
Are you ready?

257
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,520
Lila? Don't you feel well?

258
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,600
Do I have to bash the door down?

259
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,840
- Be right there.
- I'll wait for you in there.

260
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,240
It took you long enough.

261
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,480
You're so beautiful.

262
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,720
I'm so tired.

263
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,320
I just want to sleep.

264
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,960
- We'll sleep later.
- We'll sleep now, you there and me here.

265
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,958
- All right, now come here.
- I'm serious.

266
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,520
So am I.

267
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,440
What's the matter?

268
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,840
I don't want you.

269
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,958
Lila...

270
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,918
I've been waiting for tonight
for so long.

271
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,960
Please.

272
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,000
See what happens
when I just look at you?

273
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,758
Where are you going? Come!
You don't need to be scared.

274
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,478
Where are you going?

275
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,838
It's a beautiful thing, don't worry.

276
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,598
- It's beautiful, don't be scared.
- Stefano, get off me.

277
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,678
I love you more than my mother
and my sister.

278
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,358
Get off me!

279
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,880
So, you're a woman
who says no but means yes?

280
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:04,078
Cut the tantrums.
You said wait and I waited.

281
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,398
Even if being near you
without touching you, was dreadful.

282
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,838
- But now we're married, so behave.
- I don't want you! I don't want you!

283
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,638
- You disgust me, I don't want you!
- What the fuck are you doing?

284
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,798
What are you trying to do?

285
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,918
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Let me go!

286
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,758
Let me go! I don't want you!

287
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,518
You're a twig,
if I want I can snap you in two!

288
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,920
- Let me go!
- You're pissing me off!

289
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,560
You want to drive me crazy?

290
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:47,158
- Stefano!
- Wanna see how big it is?

291
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,240
Nobody's got one like mine.

292
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,038
You act like this now,

293
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,678
but tomorrow you'll be
on your knees begging me

294
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:03,278
and I'll say all right,
but only... if you're obedient.

295
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,480
Is that right? You'll be obedient?

296
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,040
Is that right? Say it!

297
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,560
As soon as we got back,
Stefano's mother invited us over.

298
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:07,638
- Come in! Here they are!
- Good evening!

299
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,598
- The newlyweds.
- Hi, Rino, how are you?

300
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,798
- Dad...
- Stefano.

301
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,000
How you've grown!

302
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,320
- Hi, Lila.
- Hi, Mamma.

303
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,078
How was the hotel?

304
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,598
Wonderful, they treated us like royalty.

305
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,078
- Did you go swimming?
- No, it was too cold.

306
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:43,760
We went for walks on the beach.
We had a great time. Didn't we, Lila?

307
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,878
- Mamma, shall we offer them a drink?
- Of course, I'll be right back.

308
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,358
I'll come with you, so I can see
the beautiful kitchen you have.

309
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,840
- Come, Nunzia.
- Come, children.

310
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,878
Lila...

311
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,598
Stefano told us that you made a fuss
about something trivial.

312
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,078
Explain it to her for once and for all.

313
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,398
The ones who risked the most
were your friends.

314
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,278
The knights in shining armor!

315
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,238
Marcello thought
you sent them to burn the car.

316
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,558
You wanted those three fools
to get a beating?

317
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,358
You wanted to ruin them?

318
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:29,000
All for a pair of shoes
that are too tight for your husband?

319
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,678
He wanted them badly, so we said yes.

320
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,398
When we were kids,
didn't you say we had to get rich?

321
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,318
Well, let us get rich
without complicating life,

322
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,278
it's already complicated enough.

323
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,120
Boy, is it ever.

324
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,558
Do you understand now?

325
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,998
Pinuccia! Come!

326
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,038
- Here we are.
- There's spumante, too!

327
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,478
Good evening, I brought some pastries.

328
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,358
Spagnuolo made them
with his own hands.

329
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,438
Hi, Alfonso.

330
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,918
- Hi, Lila.
- Alfonso.

331
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:10,198
- Good evening, everyone!
- Good evening, Pinuccia.

332
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,118
Rino, do we have something to celebrate?

333
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,320
I have something for you, Pinuccia.

334
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,558
- It's beautiful.
- I knew you'd like it.

335
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,600
It's so beautiful, thank you!

336
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,878
- Do you like it?
- It's beautiful.

337
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,478
We're one big happy family!

338
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,160
- It's very beautiful.
- I'll give you glasses.

339
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,520
Pour some in here.

340
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,478
- Rino, so you and me, what are we?
- How should I know?

341
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,360
Pinuccia...

342
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,800
You all have some?

343
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,160
Lila, what do you say?

344
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,998
Beautiful.

345
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,840
- What happened to your face?
- I fell on the rocks.

346
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,438
You have to be careful on the rocks.

347
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,880
- You need to pay attention.
- It's slippery.

348
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,000
Stefano tricked me,
he's the same as his father.

349
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,640
Remember when Don Achille
gave us money instead of the dolls?

350
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,478
We shouldn't have accepted.

351
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,800
- We bought "Little Women".
- We were wrong.

352
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,960
From that moment on
I've been wrong about everything.

353
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,358
- Would you like to study at my house?
- When?

354
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,398
- Today, tomorrow, every day.
- Stefano won't like it.

355
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,400
If he is the master,
I am the master's wife.

356
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,798
I don't know.

357
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,718
I'll give you the guest room,
I'll lock you in.

358
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,400
What for?

359
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,960
So I know you're there.

360
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,160
That I'm not alone.

361
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:39,038
<i>I felt the distance between us
had shrunk again</i>

362
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,478
<i>and I was tempted to tell her
that I had decided to quit school.</i>

363
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,200
<i>But I suddenly found
I no longer had clear ideas.</i>

364
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,838
This is the store I told you about.

365
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:58,278
Spacious, plenty of light...

366
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,798
- We also have a nice back room.
- Let's take a look.

367
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,638
It's nice and spacious!

368
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,440
How many square meters?

369
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,598
- Alfonso!
- Lenù.

370
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,078
- Coming in?
- I don't know.

371
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,000
Did you see what your brother
did to Lila?

372
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,238
- Yes.
- And you didn't say anything?

373
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,158
Women need to be educated
and we don't know what Lila did.

374
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,920
Would you do the same
to your girlfriend?

375
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,240
No, I wouldn't.

376
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,078
- Hi, Alfonso. Hi, Lenù.
- Hi.

377
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,480
Where have you been?
I haven't seen you.

378
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,118
Will you read it?

379
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,680
- Now?
- It's against the principal.

380
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,480
The top floor's dilapidated,
the roof will fall on our heads.

381
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,560
Read it,
you can give it back to me later.

382
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,640
You coming in now?

383
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,598
<i>Laura is the woman
Francesco Petrarca meets</i>

384
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,638
<i>during his stay in Avignon.</i>

385
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:12,078
The beauty of Laura's body
instills in him the desire...

386
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,158
<i>My temples were throbbing.</i>

387
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,318
<i>No one else at school
stuck their neck out like Nino,</i>

388
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,558
<i>undaunted by the teachers
or the principal.</i>

389
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,758
<i>Not only did he write beautifully,</i>

390
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,438
<i>he tackled real issues,
he had character.</i>

391
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,600
Laura is the symbol... Greco!

392
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,438
You're still not quite back with us?

393
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,880
I'm sorry, Miss Galiani.

394
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,720
- Is everything all right?
- Yes.

395
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,358
Laura is the symbol of temptation,

396
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:53,958
of sin, of distance even from God,

397
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,120
while for Dante,
Beatrice and her beauty represent...

398
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,038
Marisa and I are getting a sandwich.
Want to come?

399
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,040
I can't, I have to go home.

400
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:17,438
- Are you seeing each other?
- No, she's gotten it into her head.

401
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,640
I'm glad, it's a good thing.

402
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,838
Bye, Alfonso.

403
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,680
- Hi, Elena.
- Hi, Marisa.

404
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,040
Nino!

405
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,158
You wrote a really good piece,
it's courageous.

406
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,680
You absolutely have to publish it.

407
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,238
When you say,
the rubble of Italy stays rubble,

408
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,360
it's very heartfelt.

409
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,880
- I mean it.
- You're not convinced?

410
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,758
Miss Galiani said it's no good.

411
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,598
Why? What's wrong with it?

412
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:05,878
Forget it, it's not worth talking about.

413
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,920
But thanks.

414
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,200
<i>I never told anyone
what I felt in that moment.</i>

415
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,558
<i>Time passed and I grew familiar
with Lila's apartment,</i>

416
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:55,398
<i>with the light, the colors,
the sounds coming from the railroad.</i>

417
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,478
...in the pages
of the book we're reading,

418
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,160
in our bodies, in our flesh
and above all in plants.

419
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,478
The water molecule is composed

420
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,238
of three hydrogen atoms
and one oxygen,

421
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,040
bound together by bonds called...

422
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,998
Covalent. They're called covalent.

423
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,518
It's not three hydrogen atoms,
here it says there are two.

424
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,640
Then it's two.

425
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,878
Chemistry's such a pain!

426
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,040
Come on, make an effort.

427
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,800
Tell me about how matter is measured.

428
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,478
Let's start with one of the smallest
things you can see with the naked eye,

429
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,038
a hair,

430
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,480
which is often only
one tenth of a millimeter wide.

431
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,998
That's all I remember.

432
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,478
With a microscope we can distinguish
cells only a few microns in size.

433
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,840
Enough, I'm sick of it too.
It's always the same story.

434
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,840
Inside small things there's something
smaller that wants to burst out.

435
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,878
Outside a big thing there's something
bigger that wants to keep it prisoner.

436
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,838
- I didn't understand a thing.
- Nonsense.

437
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,840
Coffee's ready.

438
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,480
Look how well you came out here.

439
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,478
If you say so.

440
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,800
But you do, you look beautiful,
like when you're happy.

441
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,360
- He kissed you on Ischia?
- As if!

442
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:33,120
Sarratore looks like he thinks
he's something special.

443
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,958
- Why do you like him?
- I don't like him.

444
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,878
I told you.

445
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,918
- I never see him.
- Don't you go to the same school?

446
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,960
- Yes, but I never see him.
- Forget him, Antonio's better.

447
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,038
Why do you say that?

448
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,040
He's skinny, ugly and presumptuous.

449
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:06,598
You're right, I used to like him
when we were in elementary school.

450
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,440
I don't like him anymore.

451
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,000
How are things with Antonio?

452
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,238
Good.

453
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:23,198
I feel comfortable,
even though I don't think I love him.

454
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,238
When do you see each other?

455
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,238
Usually when the workshop closes,
before dinner,

456
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,040
but lately I've always been
here studying.

457
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,718
Come with me.

458
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,320
- Where?
- Come with me.

459
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:25,478
- How is it?
- Fantastic.

460
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,360
Now you'll smell nice for Antonio.

461
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:36,238
- Do you take one every day?
- When I feel like it.

462
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,160
You can come and take one
whenever you want.

463
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:49,078
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

464
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,840
- With Stefano?
- Good.

465
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,360
No, it's horrible.

466
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,678
Like in Amalfi?

467
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:06,438
- Yes.
- He hit you again?

468
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,840
No, it's not so much that.

469
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,958
- It's the humiliation.
- What are you going to do?

470
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,918
What can I do?

471
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,560
I'll do what he wants
so I can do what I want.

472
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,040
That will be him.

473
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:35,518
Hello? Yes, that's me.
Yes, Signora Carracci.

474
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:40,638
I ordered it, yes.
Not the red one, the blue satin one.

475
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,198
<i>I soon realized that married
she was lonelier,</i>

476
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,958
<i>she didn't see anyone except me.</i>

477
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,558
<i>The condition of wife
had sealed her in a glass container,</i>

478
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,038
<i>like a boat navigating
with sails unfurled</i>

479
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,200
<i>in an inaccessible space,
even without any sea.</i>

480
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,318
- Hi.
- Hi.

481
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:20,558
Antonio? At the workshop
they said he'd already left.

482
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,280
He's here, come in.

483
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,160
- Hi.
- Hi, Lenù.

484
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,558
You look so pretty.
Are you wearing makeup?

485
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:50,360
I took a bath at Lila's place
then she made me over.

486
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,358
- What's the matter?
- The card arrived.

487
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,840
Enzo and Antonio have to be soldiers.

488
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,680
- You really have to go?
- Yes.

489
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,118
I'm in the third draft,
Enzo's in the first.

490
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,758
Lucky you, Pasquale, they rejected you.

491
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,798
Damn me that I didn't have
tuberculosis like you!

492
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,958
I'm sorry they rejected me,
I wanted to be a soldier.

493
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,998
People like us
should learn to use weapons

494
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,438
because soon
those who should pay will pay.

495
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,438
When I get back
I'll teach you to shoot.

496
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:32,400
- You're overreacting.
- We're overreacting?

497
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:37,838
Just think how cute
he's going to look with short hair.

498
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:41,398
I'm worried about my mother, about Ada.

499
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,078
I'm the only one working,
bringing money in.

500
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:49,358
- If I go away...
- We'll get by somehow.

501
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:53,918
Antonio... Stefano Carracci
wasn't a soldier,

502
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,598
maybe there's a way out for you too.

503
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,438
Lenù, ask Lila what Stefano did.

504
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,438
That's right, you're the son
of a widowed mother too.

505
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,200
- He'll tell us.
- Except we're not Stefano Carracci...

506
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,558
- I wonder what it's like in the army.
- It's shit.

507
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:18,118
- If you don't bend, they break you.
- Let them try with me.

508
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:21,600
Let them try, I'll break them!

509
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,878
You gotta stay close to him.

510
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,918
People are more important than books.
Antonio's fragile, help him.

511
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,318
I've been looking after a crazy person
since I was a kid,

512
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,720
two would really be too much.

513
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,958
Melina! Have you seen Antonio?

514
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,760
- No, he'll be at the workshop.
- All right.

515
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,040
Antonio!

516
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,998
- Don't be like this.
- What's going on? I never see you.

517
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,918
- I have a lot of homework.
- Has it suddenly increased?

518
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,278
- It's always been a lot.
- Lately you didn't have any.

519
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,480
Just happened like that.

520
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,680
- Good evening, Antonio.
- Evening, Salvatore.

521
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,998
- Why are you wearing makeup?
- I told you.

522
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,638
It was Lila, after my bath
she wanted to make me up.

523
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,400
Yeah, sure...

524
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,320
Wait!

525
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,838
You don't wear makeup
to school, do you?

526
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:01,198
- What are you talking about?
- I warned you.

527
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,078
You know what'll happen if I see
you talk to that asshole Sarratore.

528
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:08,638
- What are you talking about?
- I can't give you what Lila's got.

529
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,678
- You don't know what I want.
- You're always at her house.

530
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,958
You want to do what she does!

531
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,958
- What are you hiding from me?
- Nothing.

532
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,040
Do you still love me?

533
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,798
I'm scared that if I leave
you won't wait for me.

534
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:29,678
I'm scared you'll find someone else,
that's what I'm scared of.

535
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,598
You need to relax.

536
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:36,000
Enzo just got engaged to Carmela,
but he trusts her.

537
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,640
Why don't you ever trust me?

538
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,518
Have a good night!

539
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,638
Vittorio, don't get used to it,
I'm not your driver!

540
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,600
Papa's there, I have to go.

541
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,560
Lenù!

542
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,238
- Come with me.
- I can't!

543
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,920
Come with me!

544
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:12,318
I don't trust you
because you're beautiful

545
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,358
and you're good at school, too.

546
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:18,160
You read, you study,
you speak proper Italian.

547
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,960
What do I have in common with you?

548
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,320
Don't talk rubbish.

549
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,760
You'll see,
everything will be all right.

550
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,600
Don't ever leave me.

551
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,000
Hi, Lenù.

552
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,598
You came early,
do you have a lot to study?

553
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,080
No, I wanted to ask you something.

554
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,238
- Is Stefano home?
- No. What do you want to ask me?

555
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,638
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

556
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,760
Shall I come back tomorrow?

557
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,678
Come on, come in.

558
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:32,320
- Are you sure?
- Have an <i>orzata </i>then go.

559
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,038
- I'm in a hurry.
- Where do you have to go?

560
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,358
What do you want to ask?

561
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:47,198
I need something,
Antonio is beside himself.

562
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,478
His military service card arrived,
he's desperate.

563
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,200
Sit down.

564
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,358
I don't want to bother you,

565
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:04,760
but do you know how Stefano
got out of military service?

566
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:11,160
- I have no idea, but I can ask him.
- Would you do me this favor?

567
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,038
What's that?

568
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,918
- They have nowhere else to go.
- Who?

569
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,880
Rino and Pinuccia, never mind.

570
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:55,478
- And Stefano?
- He doesn't know.

571
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,438
You're crazy,
if he comes back he'll kill you.

572
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,600
He's never home before eight.

573
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,198
Lenù! How are you?

574
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,678
- Good, you?
- Good.

575
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,878
We came to look at the railroad.

576
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,198
Pinuccia's never been here
during the day.

577
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,318
- Right, sure.
- Have you been here long?

578
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:24,520
- No, I just got here.
- That's good.

579
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:36,640
Nice record player, huh?
Remember, at home I did it.

580
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:45,638
- Lenù...
- Pinuccia.

581
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:49,320
- How are things?
- I'm good, and you?

582
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,278
We're leaving, we just came
to see the house.

583
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,878
- And the railroad.
- Let's go.

584
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,840
Pinuccia, I was just wondering.

585
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,438
Do you know why Stefano
was exempted from military service?

586
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,198
The only way to get out of it is to pay.

587
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,078
- Stefano paid?
- Yes.

588
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:13,200
But no one must know. Please, Lenù.

589
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,118
How much did he pay?

590
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,880
I don't know,
the Solaras took care of it.

591
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:23,838
- What do you mean, the Solaras?
- We have to go.

592
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,638
Yes, but I'd like a coffee.

593
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,040
Explain it to me first
then I'll make you some.

594
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,478
Neither Michele nor Marcello
went into the army.

595
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,398
They were declared unfit
because of thoracic insufficiency.

596
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,198
We have to go.

597
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:46,838
- Those two? How is that possible?
- With contacts.

598
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:49,878
- And Stefano?
- He asked them.

599
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,478
You pay and they do you the favor.

600
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,518
Would the Solaras do the favor
also for Antonio?

601
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:59,158
You do favors for those who can pay
or who can return them.

602
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,358
Antonio would never ask the Solaras.

603
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:05,158
I'll ask Marcello and Michele
on the sly if they can help him.

604
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,838
You don't love your boyfriend

605
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:10,118
if you're willing to humiliate yourself
with the Solaras.

606
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,878
You know
they won't lift a finger for him.

607
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,118
- We have to go.
- Wait.

608
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,318
Move it!

609
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,360
Have a nice day.

610
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,520
Do you get it?

611
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:37,320
- He tricked me from the beginning.
- What do you mean?

612
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:42,000
Stefano and the Solaras were thick
as thieves before the wedding.

613
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:46,200
The shoes, the store, the debts...
have nothing to do with it.

614
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,958
He used me as a bargaining chip.

615
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,078
So why are you happy?

616
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,278
They were already buddies
before our engagement.

617
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,718
- You're exaggerating.
- He told me a bunch of bullshit.

618
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:03,240
It's got nothing to do with selling
shoes in stores in the city.

619
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:08,958
The debts from the store,
the best man...

620
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,240
That he wanted to help my family...

621
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:17,398
If it's like that, Lenù,

622
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,360
what's the difference
between Stefano and Marcello?

623
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,200
I don't understand.

624
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,880
At least Marcello doesn't
have to answer to anyone.

625
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,638
I'll come with you.

626
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,118
- Where will you come with me?
- To the Solaras.

627
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,198
Don't you want
to ask the favor for Antonio?

628
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:05,318
- Not with you.
- Why?

629
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,398
- You'll make Stefano mad.
- Who gives a shit!

630
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,360
If he can talk to them,
so can I, I'm his wife.

631
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:17,080
What are you doing?

632
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,720
Why are you dressing up like that?

633
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,640
Are you insane? Stefano will kill you.

634
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:36,758
I said I'll go alone.
How do you come into it?

635
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,240
I don't want you to get into trouble
because of me.

636
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:43,720
Why are you putting on that lipstick?

637
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,440
You'll see.

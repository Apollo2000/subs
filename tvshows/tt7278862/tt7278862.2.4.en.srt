1
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,958
Go with the kiss!

2
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,520
Kiss!

3
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,360
Don't overdo it, though.

4
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,040
Look at her belly!
How many months are you?

5
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,320
- Lila, what are you doing?
- She's out of her mind!

6
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,878
Where did she get her manners?

7
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,758
- What did she do?
- Nothing happened, keep playing!

8
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,400
It's nothing. I'm sorry, madam.

9
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,838
She's so rude.

10
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,198
- What happened?
- I don't know how he puts up with her.

11
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,678
What happened?

12
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,358
That lady lifted Pinuccia's dress
to show her big thighs

13
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,118
and said to Stefano: "Look what fine
thighs your sister has, what a belly!"

14
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,198
"Women today look like broomsticks,"

15
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,638
"whereas those like her
are made to bear children."

16
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,238
- And Lila?
- And Lila threw her wine at her.

17
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,518
I know why she's acting like this.

18
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,398
We all know,

19
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,238
but that's not a good reason
to make him look bad.

20
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,998
- Why?
- They had her examined.

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,078
- Who?
- Stefano, his parents.

22
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,278
They want to know how come
she only got pregnant once.

23
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,278
Everything seems to be in order.

24
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,320
The doctor said
she only needs to get stronger.

25
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,160
<i>"Get stronger," that's what he said.</i>

26
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,318
<i>It meant that Lila, despite the strength
she manifested at all times,</i>

27
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,640
<i>was weak.</i>

28
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,078
<i>It meant that children
didn't come to her</i>

29
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,838
<i>not because she possessed
some mysterious power,</i>

30
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,360
<i>but because, on the contrary,
she was fragile.</i>

31
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,040
<i>My resentment died down.</i>

32
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,480
- Lila.
- Lenù.

33
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,200
Why did you throw wine at her?

34
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,920
- They told me you went to the doctor.
- Yes.

35
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,278
How did it go?

36
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,880
He poked around inside me
with a metal thing.

37
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,160
I gave him a lot of money
only to find out I need to get stronger.

38
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,078
I have to go swimming in the sea.

39
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,800
They say if you swim in the sea
you get stronger and children come.

40
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,120
Stefano wants to rent a house
in Torre Annunziata.

41
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,000
He wants me to go with my mother
and Pinuccia for two months.

42
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,598
It could be worse.
I'm working all summer.

43
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,198
Two months with my mother
and Pinuccia, I'll kill myself.

44
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,198
Don't say that.
Go swimming, get some sun.

45
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,880
If I could get stronger in your place,
I'd go tomorrow.

46
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,720
Then come with me.

47
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,000
I can't, I have to work
at the bookstore.

48
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,598
Quit.

49
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,878
I'll pay you what the bookseller does.

50
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,318
Don't be silly!
My mother would never let me.

51
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,320
I'll take care of your mother.

52
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,560
All right.

53
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,758
But let's go to Ischia
where I've already been,

54
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,760
that way my mother
won't worry so much.

55
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,358
Gee, it's hot!
I can't wait to get in the water.

56
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,520
Come on, get going!

57
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,318
- I can't walk anymore.
- It's not far.

58
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,998
You already said that twice.
Look at my swollen ankles.

59
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,198
- We're nearly there.
- If we're nearly there, let's stop here.

60
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,680
It's nicer there, trust me.

61
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,400
No, okay, let's stop here.

62
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,238
Lenù!

63
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,080
Who's that?

64
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,798
- What a surprise!
- Good morning, how are you?

65
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,598
- Well! I'll help you.
- No, don't worry.

66
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,238
I wouldn't dream of it.
What a surprise!

67
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,320
Come and say hello to my wife. Lidia!

68
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,398
Look!

69
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,598
They were girls, look what lovely
young ladies they are now.

70
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,840
I didn't think I'd see you.

71
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,478
Nella didn't tell us.

72
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,598
We're vacationing in Cuotto
and we came for a walk down here.

73
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,558
Walking under the sun,
I can't take anymore.

74
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,118
Then get undressed
and go for a swim.

75
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,160
Kids! Look who's here.

76
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,998
Hi, Lenù!

77
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,038
Come for a swim with us.

78
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,598
Leave Lenù alone.
You go for a swim, then we'll eat.

79
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,800
You're so pretty, Lenù.
I'm so happy to see you.

80
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,480
Sit next to me,
so you can tell me everything.

81
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,078
- School?
- Good, I passed.

82
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,280
You're so modest!
Who knows what grades you got!

83
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,278
Marisa has to repeat four subjects.

84
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,478
As punishment she stayed
with her aunt and uncle.

85
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,038
She has private lessons
almost every day.

86
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,998
Some subjects are hard
to get the hang of.

87
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,920
You're too kind,
the truth is that Marisa's a shirker.

88
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,160
Don't worry about Marisa,
if need be, I'll help her.

89
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,958
No, in that case, there's Nino, too,
he's clever like you.

90
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,160
- Where is he now?
- Here he is.

91
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,198
Maybe you wanted to go for a swim
and I'm keeping you here.

92
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,518
Don't worry,
I haven't seen you for a long time.

93
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,200
Sure?

94
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,078
- What are you doing here?
- Hi.

95
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,240
I came to visit Signora Nella.

96
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,318
Isn't that Lila?

97
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,558
Yes, and that's Pinuccia,
her sister-in-law.

98
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,640
I don't know if you remember her.

99
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,000
We've rented a house at Cuotto.
We're staying until early September.

100
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,558
Nunzia, Lila's mother, came with us.

101
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,398
How is she? I haven't seen her for ages.

102
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,320
The husbands come on the weekends.

103
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,720
Come to the beach at Citara some time.

104
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,840
This is the address I'm staying at.
In Forio.

105
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,920
It's not hard, it's a big white house
with an angel on top.

106
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,678
- I have to go.
- Already?

107
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,358
- I have to study.
- Eat something first.

108
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,000
- Bye, Lenù. Bye, Mamma.
- Bye...

109
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,880
Can you float?
So, now go from here to there.

110
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:38,238
- Take care, the lady's pregnant.
- I'll carry her like a princess.

111
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,038
Holy mother! Go slowly!

112
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,640
- You'll come back to visit? Promise me?
- Lenù!

113
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,318
You're sneaky.

114
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,800
You made us come
just so you could see Nino.

115
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,358
- Whatever do you mean?
- Confess.

116
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,638
- You like him.
- If it's true, you really are selfish.

117
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,640
All this effort just to see a guy?

118
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,558
But you had fun, didn't you?

119
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,040
We did, but Nino didn't give you
much encouragement.

120
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,118
That's how he is, he had to study.

121
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,520
How he is... is bad.
He's as rude as his father is nice.

122
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,838
His father has the manners
of a gentleman,

123
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,758
he even taught me how to swim.

124
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,958
He's great.

125
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,358
He wrote that the panel
at Piazza dei Martiri was ugly.

126
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,880
He was right.

127
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,518
Have you forgotten?
He was the one who ruined Melina.

128
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,680
Or maybe,
he made her feel good for once.

129
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,240
Nino gave me his address.

130
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,038
When Stefano and Rino come,
I'll go visit him, do you mind?

131
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,518
Hear that? Lenù has a date!
She's even got the address!

132
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,718
When your husbands come,
what am I supposed to do?

133
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,800
You know what you can do?
Keep my mother company.

134
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,400
I didn't bring you here to have fun.

135
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,718
Boss! How much longer?
I'm getting nauseous.

136
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,680
Ten minutes and we're there, ma'am.

137
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,318
<i>I held back from saying anything.</i>

138
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,480
<i>"Cut your tongue out
and don't provoke her," I thought.</i>

139
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,400
<i>After all, I had obtained what I wanted.</i>

140
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,758
- I can't do it!
- Keep still.

141
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,478
Then tell me what I have to do!

142
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,120
Put your head back.
Put it back or you won't float.

143
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,720
- But like this I'll drown.
- I'm holding you up.

144
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,478
- Don't take your hand away.
- I won't take it away.

145
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,200
Close your mouth,
or you'll take in water.

146
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,440
Good, that's it.

147
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,478
- There they are! Nino!
- Lenù!

148
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,880
Nino!

149
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,240
You've organized your day very well:
you study and I cook and shop.

150
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,838
Why, can you see me cooking?

151
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,758
- Why me and not you?
- You're better at it.

152
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,438
If you don't like it,
take me out to eat.

153
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,958
Wouldn't you like that?

154
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,280
Bruno's a catch, his father owns
the Soccavo salami factory.

155
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,518
Is anyone hungry, thirsty?

156
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,278
Maybe something cool.

157
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,158
- Let's go get coconut.
- Shall we go, Lenù?

158
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,080
You wanted to take a walk.

159
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,680
- No, maybe I'll join you later.
- If you like, I'll bring it.

160
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,280
No, I'll come with you.

161
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,400
Wouldn't want the baby
to be born craving coconut.

162
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,520
Lenù, sit here.

163
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,358
Bruno's kind.

164
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,840
You can tell he comes
from a good family.

165
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,958
I wouldn't know.

166
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,160
I don't trust people
who do business in this region.

167
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,518
Naples, Ischia, the whole of Campania

168
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,838
is in the hands of the worst people
who think they're the best.

169
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,958
They're predators,
destroyers, bloodsuckers.

170
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,598
People who've raked in the money
but don't even pay taxes.

171
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,158
And the builders,
the Camorrists' lawyers,

172
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,598
Christian Democrats, shopkeepers...

173
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,038
They behave as if cement
were mixed in Heaven

174
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,638
and God himself, with an
enormous trowel, flung blocks of it

175
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,678
down onto the hills, the coasts.

176
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,880
Excuse me, who are shopkeepers?

177
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,998
Tradespeople.

178
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,320
- So why call them shopkeepers?
- That's what they're called.

179
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,478
My husband's a shopkeeper.

180
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,760
- I didn't mean to offend you.
- I'm not offended.

181
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,040
Do you pay taxes?

182
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,158
You'd have to ask my husband,
it's the first time I've heard of it.

183
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,680
- Really?
- Yes.

184
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,520
Taxes are important to plan
the economic life of a community.

185
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,038
Does planning put an end
to Camorrists, shopkeepers, cement?

186
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,640
Of course not. But, if done well,
everything works better.

187
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,918
- Do you remember Pasquale Peluso?
- No.

188
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,198
He's a bricklayer.

189
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,280
Without all that cement,
he'd lose his job.

190
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,518
But he's a Communist.

191
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,478
He also thinks it's dirty money
and that all this cement is disgusting.

192
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,358
I don't understand
what you're getting at.

193
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,040
It's a mess.

194
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,000
I hoped I'd understand things
listening to you two study.

195
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,520
I'm going to get some coconut, too.

196
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,720
Lila's really lost.

197
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,000
What a pity.

198
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,918
I'm glad you came here to the beach.

199
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,880
Me too.

200
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,200
Thank you.

201
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,598
Bruno's a guy with manners.

202
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,678
At the beach bar he bought me
things without showing off.

203
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,920
Everything he wears
is expensive, he's a catch.

204
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,798
But Lenuccia likes the other one.

205
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,558
What are you talking about?

206
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,038
She likes the son of the poet,
the railway worker, remember?

207
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,518
Sure.

208
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,758
Real skinny, tall.
He thinks he's better than everyone.

209
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,118
It's not true.

210
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,758
Sure it's true,
you can see it in his eyes.

211
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,960
- What does Sarratore's son do?
- He's a university student.

212
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,438
Well, if you love each other,
you'll have to wait.

213
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,158
There's nothing to wait for,
Signora Nunzia.

214
00:21:54,160 --> 00:22:00,198
- We're just friends.
- Yes, but let's say you get engaged...

215
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,718
First he has to finish his studies,
then he has to find a suitable job.

216
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,718
And only when he finds it
can you get married.

217
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,358
- Who's getting married?
- No one.

218
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,360
- Pinuccia's being funny.
- Would you like some lemonade?

219
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,078
Lenù...

220
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,680
- Come with me for a moment.
- Yes.

221
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,520
Will you give me one of your books?

222
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,880
- Why?
- Because I want to read.

223
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,040
All right.

224
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,280
THE IDEA OF NATION

225
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,320
HIROSHIMA, THE DAY AFTER

226
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,360
THE THEATER OF SAMUEL BECKETT

227
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,720
- What is it?
- Theater plays.

228
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,598
- Have you read it?
- No.

229
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,640
But it's the easiest one.

230
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,600
Thank you.

231
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,758
<i>She wanted to read.</i>

232
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,838
<i>How long since she had opened
a book? Three, four years?</i>

233
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,440
<i>And why had she decided
to start again now?</i>

234
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,560
Leaving for Maronti...

235
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,038
They're here.

236
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,560
We're over here!

237
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,238
They look a prince and his servant,
only the prince is skint.

238
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,158
- Cut it out.
- It's true!

239
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,120
Yeah, but that's enough.

240
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,318
- Hi.
- Hi.

241
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,358
- We came here because it's quieter.
- Good idea.

242
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,680
You've made your own private room.

243
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,918
- May I?
- Yes, I've read it.

244
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:49,198
If you're interested, there's a good
article about neocolonialism in Africa.

245
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,238
God help us. What a drag.

246
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,638
- Pinù, look what I brought you.
- Thank you!

247
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,760
- This is the one I like.
- I know.

248
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,560
You and I together equal eight eyes.

249
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,558
Pinù, let's go.
I'll treat you to something.

250
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,358
- Yes, I'm coming with you.
- Forget them.

251
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,200
- Thank you.
- They're acting like intellectuals.

252
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,760
Have you ever been to see a play?

253
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,358
A few times.

254
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,558
- Did you like it?
- It was okay.

255
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,040
I've never been,
but I've seen it on television.

256
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,800
- It's not the same thing.
- I know, but it's better than nothing.

257
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,720
Have you read this?

258
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,078
No.

259
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,678
So, there's something
you haven't read, then!

260
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,320
Very funny.

261
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,280
You should read it.

262
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,920
There's this character
named Dan Rooney.

263
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,118
He's blind,
but he doesn't care,

264
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,240
because he thinks life
is better without sight.

265
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:52,158
At a certain point he wonders,
if he became deaf and mute,

266
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,840
life would be even more life.

267
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,880
Pure life.

268
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,918
I didn't understand a thing.
Did you really like it?

269
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,320
It made me think.

270
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,998
What does it mean that life is more life
without seeing, hearing, speaking?

271
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,598
- Maybe it's just a gimmick.
- What gimmick!

272
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,998
It's something that suggests
thousands more.

273
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,640
It's not a gimmick.

274
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,958
- Did you finish it?
- Yes.

275
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,440
- Will you lend it to me?
- It's Mrs. Galiani's, she lent it to me.

276
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,400
Have you read it?

277
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:45,160
- I thought I'd start tonight.
- Well, when you're done, give it to me.

278
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,360
If you're so interested,
you read it first.

279
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,998
- Tomorrow we can discuss it, Lila.
- Not tomorrow, we won't see each other.

280
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,400
- Why?
- My husband's coming tonight.

281
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,600
But we can see each other.

282
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,398
I'd really like that, but I remembered
I can't come tomorrow either.

283
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,038
Bruno's parents are coming back
and I'm going to sleep at Barano.

284
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,920
Monday?

285
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,880
All right, I'm going for a swim.

286
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,118
If I lend you a book
which, by the way, isn't even mine,

287
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,838
don't bring it to the beach.

288
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,598
I can't give it back
to Mrs. Galiani with sand in it.

289
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,520
- Or else I won't lend you any more.
- Sorry.

290
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,680
You're right.

291
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,480
Don't eat them all,
you'll ruin your appetite.

292
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,280
- Want some?
- Don't bug me.

293
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,958
Calm down, Pinù! What's wrong?

294
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,000
Don't tell me to calm down.
Your calm gets on my nerves!

295
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,800
I can't stand your calm.

296
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,040
What's wrong? What happened?

297
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,238
- Did Bruno say something unpleasant?
- No.

298
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,878
- So, what happened?
- Nothing.

299
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,400
- Don't you feel well?
- No, no...

300
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,760
I don't know.

301
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,320
- Anyone home?
- They're here.

302
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,720
Hello, Mamma!

303
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,438
- Hello, everything all right?
- Welcome.

304
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,078
- Hi, Lenù.
- Hi.

305
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,238
What's this delicious smell, Mamma?

306
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,560
- In front of everyone?
- What's the big deal?

307
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,600
- Beautiful!
- Shall we go upstairs?

308
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,680
- I'm already hungry.
- Stop it! You oaf!

309
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,598
Mamma, we're going upstairs.

310
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,400
We'll go up now, too. Walk.

311
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,120
- What's wrong, Pinù?
- Nothing, it'll pass.

312
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,558
Pinuccia gets all twisted up
but then she straightens up.

313
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,678
It's the pregnancy.

314
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,398
Remember when Lila came back
from her honeymoon?

315
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,918
And look at her now.

316
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,760
That's life: one time it kisses you
and another it hits you.

317
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,158
My husband was like that,

318
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,560
sometimes good
and sometimes really bad.

319
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,720
You can love someone all your life
and not know who they really are.

320
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,200
Go get me some rosemary.

321
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,600
Kids, come here!

322
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,600
Throw the stick.

323
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,560
<i>I spent the weekend
reading on the terrace.</i>

324
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,358
<i>I woke up late and as soon as
I opened my eyes I was met</i>

325
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:03,240
<i>by a distant sensation of longing
that distressed me.</i>

326
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,638
- Mamma!
- How was the water?

327
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,238
Fantastic, calm.
Lila, I'm going to take a shower.

328
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,360
We're late, will you get my bag ready?

329
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,840
Darling, will you pack my case?
We have to go.

330
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,278
- What will we eat tonight?
- I did some mullet.

331
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,918
I'll do them with potatoes.

332
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,360
Here, Lenù, peel them.

333
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,320
- Lila, are you getting my stuff ready?
- Coming!

334
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,078
- You didn't go to the beach?
- No.

335
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,120
- You were here all day?
- Yes.

336
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,840
- I finished this.
- Will you give me another one?

337
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,238
When you take a book,
you have to ask me.

338
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,438
All right. Sorry.

339
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,120
How come you suddenly
want to read again?

340
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,480
- Lila, where are you?
- Coming.

341
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,840
None of your business.

342
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,878
- Hi!
- Hi!

343
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,078
Why didn't Bruno come?
He had something better to do?

344
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,440
No, his parents are still there.
He'll come as soon as they leave.

345
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,558
He's coming,
he'll be here in ten minutes.

346
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:20,000
You sure? If not I'll go home.
I'm fed up with you three.

347
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,920
Whereas you have no idea
how happy I am to be here.

348
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:31,158
My father got his leave extended
with a fake medical certificate,

349
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,560
a friend of his wrote it for him.

350
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,838
That man is in every way
the negation of the general good.

351
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,360
- Michele, I'll have a soda.
- All right.

352
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,840
I'm so glad to see you.

353
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,520
- May I give you a kiss, too?
- Sure.

354
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,520
- Can I have a <i>cedrata?</i>
- Right away, miss.

355
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,680
There he is!

356
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,478
This one? Come!

357
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,800
Come on, you slacker, hurry up!

358
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,360
- Let's split into teams.
- I'll hold the scarf.

359
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,040
Number... one!

360
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,360
No! Go, go!

361
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,478
<i>That week, the wary distances gave way.</i>

362
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,598
<i>We became a group of friends
who had fun with little or nothing.</i>

363
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,678
<i>Thus, a thread of happiness
began to extend</i>

364
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,080
<i>through the hours and the days.</i>

365
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,480
Put her here!

366
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,558
<i>I no longer minded
that Lila took my books,</i>

367
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,840
<i>in fact, I thought it was a good thing.</i>

368
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,918
What's going on?
Are your husbands coming today?

369
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,600
Of course.

370
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,680
- And what do you get up to?
- We eat, we drink and we go to bed.

371
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,040
Do they stay on Sunday nights too?

372
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,560
No.

373
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,720
On Sunday, we eat, we drink
and we go to bed in the afternoon.

374
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,960
Whereas I don't eat, I don't drink
and I don't go to bed.

375
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,960
I'm free.

376
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,278
Good.

377
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,998
Then you and I will come here
tomorrow morning at eight

378
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,600
and we'll hire a boat,
what do you say?

379
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,720
All right. At eight.

380
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,078
- I'll bring food.
- And us?

381
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,040
You've got your husbands.

382
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,120
I'll take her to get coconut.

383
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,560
Shall we go for a swim?

384
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,638
<i>It's hard to describe the sudden sense
of completeness that overcame me</i>

385
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,078
<i>when Nino said:
”I'll see you tomorrow at eight.”</i>

386
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,558
<i>I felt proud to be there,</i>

387
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,518
<i>with the two people who had always
been important in my life,</i>

388
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,840
<i>happy as I'd never been before.</i>

389
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,038
<i>"Now they'll stop," I thought.</i>

390
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,638
<i>Maybe they're having a race.</i>

391
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:25,598
Lila! Wait!

392
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,520
<i>Lila, although inexpert, didn't give in.</i>

393
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,398
<i>She wanted to keep up with him
and she pushed herself,</i>

394
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,320
<i>past the imaginary line
we had decided not to cross.</i>

395
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,358
- Where's Pinuccia?
- She's gone.

396
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,478
- Where to?
- Home.

397
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,840
What happened?

398
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,038
She says she wants to leave,

399
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,400
that she doesn't want to leave
her husband alone for so long.

400
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,398
I have to go to her.

401
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,720
When she comes out,
tell Lila to go home.

402
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:27,438
You needn't worry.
Rino knows how to cook.

403
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,758
His father's with him, his friends.

404
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:35,400
He knows you're here to rest,
to make a beautiful, healthy baby.

405
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,560
Pinù...

406
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:45,718
Rino's worked all week. Don't let him
find you like this, please.

407
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,958
'Cause then he'll worry,

408
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:52,400
he'll get angry and who do you think
he'll take it out on?

409
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,278
Pinù, what are you doing? Calm down.

410
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,240
You want to leave to be with him,
he's left to be with you.

411
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,680
Come now.

412
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,240
What made you angry?

413
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,440
Bruno?

414
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,200
Everything okay?

415
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,560
- You've certainly learned to swim well.
- What do you mean by that?

416
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,120
Speak to Pinuccia.

417
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:47,160
They're on their way.
Fix yourself up and wash your face.

418
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,800
Do you like it?

419
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,320
I'll put it on for you.

420
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,720
There, let me see.

421
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:25,280
It's beautiful,
but nothing in comparison to you.

422
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,720
Let's sit down.

423
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:38,678
How about you, Rino?
You got nothing to give to your wife?

424
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,878
You really thought
I didn't have a present for my wife?

425
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:46,278
- Here we go!
- Here, Pinù.

426
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:50,280
- I made spaghetti with mussels.
- It's a poem, I can see from here.

427
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,600
I'll put it on for you.

428
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,000
Move your hair.

429
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:08,558
- Mamma, did you see the presents?
- They're beautiful.

430
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,480
- Beautiful.
- You look great.

431
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,478
None for me.

432
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:20,438
- You're not eating?
- No, I'm tired.

433
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,958
You sure?

434
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,078
Try the wine, a villager
on Vesuvius gave it to me.

435
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,920
Pass me your glass.

436
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,480
Tell me what you think. Here.

437
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,678
I'll try it too.

438
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,438
- Mamma, will you have a drop?
- No, thanks.

439
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,518
Just a little, we're on vacation.

440
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,238
- How is it, Rino?
- Good.

441
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,238
Enjoy.

442
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,638
If you don't like the necklace,
you can change it.

443
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,880
No, it's beautiful, I love it.

444
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,480
That's it, I want to pack my bags.

445
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,000
I want to be with you.

446
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,960
I want to be with you too.

447
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,680
Excuse me.

448
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,280
Pinù?

449
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,800
Come back to the table. It's not polite.

450
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:39,798
- What happened?
- It's the pregnancy.

451
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,520
To hell with it! The pregnancy...

452
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,638
If it's your fault I swear to God
I'll smash your face in!

453
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,120
Why me?

454
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,200
Come on, let's eat.

455
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,520
Pinù! Come down!

456
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,760
I've fucking had enough!

457
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,438
I'm hungry and I wanna eat, understood?

458
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,400
- I'll be right down.
- You'll come down now!

459
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,960
You know what?

460
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,920
I'm not hungry anymore.

461
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,920
We're going to a restaurant.
Let's go.

462
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,400
You and me need to talk, come.

463
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,160
What's gotten into her?

464
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,120
Nothing, she's just scared.

465
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:34,518
<i>I didn't care about their tears,
their fights anymore.</i>

466
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:37,038
<i>My only thought
was how much I desired Nino</i>

467
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,398
<i>and how wonderful it would be
the next day</i>

468
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,680
<i>to go out early in the morning
with the cool air and see him.</i>

469
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,040
- Did I wake you?
- No, Lila.

470
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:24,840
Don't turn it on,
I'm only staying a moment.

471
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,080
See how good I am at swimming now?

472
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,360
Yes.

473
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:46,160
I have something to tell you.

474
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,360
What is it?

475
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,920
Nino kissed me.

476
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:59,440
When we were alone out in the water,
he kissed me.

477
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:04,318
I kept my lips closed, really tight.

478
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,158
I said: "Are you crazy? I'm married."

479
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:11,718
And he said, "I've loved you much
longer than your husband has,"

480
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:15,000
"since we had
that competition in class".

481
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,080
I told him to keep away from me.

482
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,240
Be careful, Lenù.

483
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:28,680
Don't go anywhere with him by yourself,
he's dangerous.

484
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,880
He pressed so hard he hurt my lips.

485
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,120
And they still hurt.

486
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:50,760
What's wrong?
Are you afraid he'll kiss me, too?

487
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,640
There'd be nothing wrong with that.
I'm not married.

488
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,160
Only, it's a pity I don't like him.

489
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,960
A kiss from him would be like putting
a dead mouse on my mouth.

490
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,600
Good night, then.

491
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,080
Good night.

492
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,720
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

493
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,878
<i>I'm married.</i>

494
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,920
<i>I've loved you much longer
than your husband has. Lila...</i>

495
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,400
<i>I've loved you since we did
that competition in class.</i>

496
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,560
Don't ever do that again.

1
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,720
He's always hungry. Always.

2
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,160
I don't have enough milk.

3
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,440
Sit down, keep me company.

4
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,318
Thank you for the blanket,
you shouldn't have.

5
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,478
- It's beautiful.
- It's my pleasure.

6
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,438
- Tell me something.
- What can I tell you?

7
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,600
I don't see anybody.

8
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,238
I study all day
and when I have time I tutor.

9
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,398
You're right to study.

10
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,238
Don't ever get married,
but above all don't have kids.

11
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,438
- What do you mean?
- You might get one as ugly as this.

12
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:19,198
- Why do you say that? He's beautiful!
- No, he's ugly. He's uglier than Rino.

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,560
Everyone's ugly in that family.

14
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,398
Hi, Pinù.
Lenù, what a nice surprise.

15
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,398
- Good evening, Signora Maria.
- Good evening.

16
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,880
There's heaps of people downstairs.

17
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,800
Come see. Come.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,758
- What are they doing?
- St Anthony's bonfire.

19
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,878
The fire takes away ailments
and the evil eye.

20
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,520
Look.

21
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,480
So many kids.

22
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,800
Let's close it. It's cold.

23
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,758
Are you still working
in the grocery store?

24
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,158
- Your friend left...
- Forget about it.

25
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,238
- She's not working there?
- Don't you know?

26
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,318
- Lila decided to work in the shoe store.
- No, I didn't know.

27
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,518
I thought she didn't care
about the shoes.

28
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,318
My poor son,
he only ever does what she wants.

29
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,438
She raised hell to get herself in there,

30
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,358
she goes to work done up
like a TV showgirl.

31
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,718
- She spent a fortune refitting the shop.
- She bought paintings.

32
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,038
- And has put books on the shelves.
- Books?

33
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,318
The Solaras have taken
Cerullo shoe styles

34
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,158
and are producing them
in a factory on the outskirts.

35
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,918
Rino and Stefano protested,
but the Solaras don't give a shit.

36
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,918
You know what Lila
had the nerve to say? Tell her.

37
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,438
"You gave those shoes to them,
you had dealings with the Solaras."

38
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,998
"If you're a pair of jerks,
what can I do?"

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,358
Now Stefano is afraid Lila will make
new styles for the Solaras.

40
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,840
- She won't.
- Have you spoken to her?

41
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,040
No, I haven't seen her since Ischia.

42
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,240
She'd never do it, I know her.

43
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,638
If something catches her attention,
she gets caught up,

44
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,398
but then she loses interest.

45
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,440
See? It's all right.
If Lenuccia says so...

46
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,038
- I've got to go.
- Come on, stay a while longer, please.

47
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,838
I'll come back some other time. Goodbye.

48
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,958
Goodbye.

49
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,678
If you like,
come back and visit me again.

50
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,280
I never go out.

51
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,840
- Bye.
- Bye.

52
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,118
We need big logs. Go and get big logs,
put these on the ground.

53
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,518
Big logs, now!

54
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,238
Give me that box.

55
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,518
- Hi, Lenù.
- Hi, Enzo.

56
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,398
Carmela, Enzo's back?

57
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,198
He's only got two days' leave,
but he finishes in two months.

58
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,760
Ada!

59
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,398
You open up tomorrow, I'll be in later.

60
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,958
- Don't forget, the supplier's coming.
- Don't worry.

61
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,800
See you tomorrow.

62
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,638
Stefano's always sad and pissed off
because of your friend.

63
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,958
- See what she's done to him?
- Pinuccia mentioned something.

64
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,478
Yes?

65
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,798
Did she tell you how Michele
drives her home in his car?

66
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,998
- Everyone's seen her.
- With Michele?

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,638
Antonio!

68
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,158
What are you doing just standing there?
Come and help us.

69
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,358
- Is Antonio back, too?
- Yes.

70
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,198
And you didn't tell me?

71
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,038
- I never see you.
- I have to study a lot.

72
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,518
He's been discharged,
they say he had a breakdown.

73
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,600
He doesn't sleep at night
and he can't find peace.

74
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,838
<i>I wondered what I had to do
with these shabby stories,</i>

75
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:30,838
<i>with the Solaras' petty vendetta,
with this anxiety over money.</i>

76
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,478
<i>And how could Lila,
after Ischia, after Nino,</i>

77
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,960
<i>go back to dealing
with those camorrists?</i>

78
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,000
Hi, Antonio.

79
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,840
- Hi, Lenù.
- How are you?

80
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,318
Pasquale's right,
there's nothing here.

81
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,560
- What do you mean?
- Work.

82
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,800
And if I don't get better, I can't work.

83
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,720
What happened to you?

84
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,038
I got scared.

85
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,158
- Scared?
- One night.

86
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,158
On guard duty, to pass the time,

87
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,518
I started thinking about a game
I played with my father.

88
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,398
He drew eyes on his fingers,
then a mouth,

89
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,600
and moved them like puppets.

90
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,320
I don't know how, but all at once...

91
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,198
I felt that those puppets
had entered my hand

92
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,240
and were moving all by themselves.

93
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,078
And then they spoke to me.

94
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,640
I tried to make them stop,
but they wouldn't.

95
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:02,360
So I bashed my hand against
the sentry box, so hard... it bled.

96
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,600
I'm still afraid, Lenù.

97
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,280
I'm afraid
it'll start up again any minute.

98
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,720
Can I help you?

99
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,438
Come, let's go see.

100
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,160
Throw it in!

101
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,560
Pasquale, you had a great idea
this year.

102
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,718
Be careful, kids!

103
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,480
Carmela, go and call Mamma,
tell her to come down.

104
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,240
Throw it in!

105
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,000
<i>St Anthony, St Anthony
Take the old and give us the new</i>

106
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,120
<i>St Anthony, St Anthony
Take the old and give us the new...</i>

107
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,760
- Antonio, what's going on?
- I don't know.

108
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,880
Pasquale, see Carmela?
What's going on?

109
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,958
Run, Mamma's locked herself in
and won't answer!

110
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,038
Mamma, don't you feel well?

111
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,560
Mamma, open the door!

112
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,480
Answer me! Speak!

113
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,040
Help!

114
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,438
- What happened?
- Something terrible!

115
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,360
Call for help!

116
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,320
Help! Call someone!

117
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,000
Pasquale...

118
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,960
See that, Lenù?

119
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,360
She has nail polish
on only one foot.

120
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,000
Mamma, talk to me!

121
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,558
<i>That day I promised myself
I'd get my diploma,</i>

122
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,598
<i>I'd apply for a job</i>

123
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,440
<i>and get as far away as possible
from all that disgusting mess.</i>

124
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,758
You write very well.

125
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,918
Do you really believe that nothing
is destined to last, not even poetry?

126
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,678
Leopardi thinks that.

127
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,920
- Are you sure?
- No.

128
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,438
But the lava also burns the broom.

129
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,558
And the day the sun cools,
everything will die.

130
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,558
Even poetry and poets.

131
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,198
And if you had to talk about beauty
starting from Leopardi?

132
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,758
- Beauty is deceit.
- Like the Leopardian garden?

133
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,758
I don't know about the garden,
but like the sea on a calm day,

134
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,678
like the sky at night.

135
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,798
It's face powder applied over horror.

136
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,480
If we remove it,
we are left alone with our fear.

137
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,320
Greco!

138
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,400
The teacher wants to talk to you.

139
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,838
I hope you wish to keep studying.

140
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:15,158
You could try for the Normale,
the university in Pisa, do you know it?

141
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,638
- No.
- It's a very important university.

142
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,478
If you passed the admissions exam,

143
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,998
it would be free,
even board and lodging.

144
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,318
Think it over. If you're interested,
come back tomorrow.

145
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,280
I'll give you all the information.

146
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,800
- I'll go back up.
- Be right there.

147
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,918
It's a huge opportunity,
promise you'll think about it.

148
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,678
I'm not good enough.

149
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,518
You have to do an exam
like this one, why not try?

150
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,440
- I had too many uncertainties.
- What uncertainties? You did well.

151
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,960
I have to talk to you.

152
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,958
Do you have any news of Sarratore?

153
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,038
- Tell me the truth.
- It's the truth.

154
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,038
I haven't heard from him,
nor has my daughter.

155
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,718
I haven't seen him for months.

156
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,998
- Did he drop you, too?
- Me?

157
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,078
Nadia's convinced he left her for you.

158
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,040
There's never been anything between us.

159
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,278
Better that way.

160
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,360
- Tell Nadia I had nothing to do with it.
- Of course.

161
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,518
He broke up with Nadia
in a very unpleasant way.

162
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,918
He sent her a few lines,
she suffered horribly.

163
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,760
Never mind, you're young,
sorrow helps one grow.

164
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,638
Good luck, Elena.

165
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,640
- I'll go up, I'm needed for the exams.
- Thank you, miss.

166
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,998
<i>After the exam, I treated myself
to a stroll around Naples.</i>

167
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,758
<i>During winter, I often thought
of the previous summer,</i>

168
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,158
<i>when Lila, Nino and I were a happy trio.</i>

169
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,278
<i>What happened after that?</i>

170
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,798
<i>She didn't contact me, nor did he.</i>

171
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,640
<i>But why should I worry about them
when they didn't care about me?</i>

172
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,958
<i>As I was lost in these thoughts,
I realized, too late,</i>

173
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,240
<i>that I had ended up
in Piazza dei Martiri.</i>

174
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,398
<i>I didn't know anything
about Lila's new habits.</i>

175
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,878
<i>Did she stay in the store for lunch
or go to a bar?</i>

176
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,560
<i>Did she walk along the seafront,
or maybe take a nap inside?</i>

177
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,520
- Who is it?
- Elena.

178
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,400
Lenù!

179
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,038
You look so different.

180
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,558
It's been so long! Where have you been?

181
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:33,520
- Studying for my high school diploma.
- You're such a good girl. Come in.

182
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:44,238
- I'm not that good.
- If you have to do something, you do it.

183
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,360
- How come you're working here?
- I don't want to hide anything from you.

184
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,480
You can come out, it's Lenù.

185
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,480
Hi.

186
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,520
Sit down.

187
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,238
We didn't tell you to avoid
putting you in a dangerous situation.

188
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,758
- Do you understand?
- Sure.

189
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,998
I understand.

190
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,240
We meet here, secretly.
But now it's all going to change.

191
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,160
We want our own place, our own life.

192
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,400
I can't bear living apart
from him anymore.

193
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,240
I'm pregnant.

194
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:22,078
I've saved a little money.
I've applied for an apartment.

195
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,000
12 thousand a month,
we're going to live there.

196
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,318
- Then what will you do?
- Do what?

197
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,078
About Stefano, for money?

198
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,878
I'm so happy,
don't put sad ideas into my head.

199
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,278
Stefano will understand.

200
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,518
I'll make him a nice dinner
and I'll explain everything.

201
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,278
We'll see about the money later.

202
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,358
Nino will write articles,
he'll find a job.

203
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,118
Maybe he'll take a little longer
to finish his exams,

204
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,440
but we'll live together
like a real family.

205
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,838
What need is there to leave Stefano?

206
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,958
You're good at telling lies,
you've told him so many.

207
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,878
You can keep doing it.

208
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,878
Telling lies has stopped me
from being killed.

209
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,680
But enough now.

210
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,840
Now I'd rather be killed
than go on like this.

211
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,918
I have to go, I have lots to do
before I leave for Pisa.

212
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,880
- Pisa?
- Yes.

213
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,518
I'm going to the Normale,
an important university.

214
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,358
- Well done, Lenù.
- Bye.

215
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,760
- Wait, I'll help you.
- I'll go, they might see you.

216
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,320
- Bye, Lenù.
- Bye.

217
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,118
Where will you get the money?
The train alone costs a fortune!

218
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,518
If I win the scholarship,
I won't spend a cent.

219
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,078
And if you don't win it?

220
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,358
Besides, do you think
you won't need money to live in Pisa?

221
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,718
I've saved a little from tutoring,
I gave you the rest.

222
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,078
Are you going to rub our nose
in the pennies you gave us?

223
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,398
Stop it! I'm not going to stand here
and listen to your bullshit!

224
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,918
It's not bullshit!
I want to keep studying!

225
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:22,318
I've always done what you wanted,
worked in the house, now enough!

226
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,398
Now I decide!

227
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,318
I'm going to Pisa
even if you don't want me to.

228
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,398
Don't overdo it,
do what you have to do,

229
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,678
but this time we can't help you.

230
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,438
Go to Pisa! Who gives a shit!

231
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,960
I've always known that you think
you're better than me, than everyone!

232
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,840
My back hurts, it hurts here.

233
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,478
Who knows if I'll still be alive
when you get back.

234
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,480
I'm going to rest up a little.
Kids, get off the bed.

235
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,958
Can we come to Pisa, too?

236
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,518
I still have to get in,
I have to do the entrance exam.

237
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,280
No!

238
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,600
If you go, it's to get in.

239
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,198
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

240
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,880
- Is it free?
- I'll help you, miss.

241
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:13,320
- Do you want to sit by the window?
- Yes, thank you.

242
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,238
<i>I, Elena Greco,
the daughter of a porter,</i>

243
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,998
<i>at 19, got myself
out of the neighborhood,</i>

244
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,960
<i>and left Naples for the first time.</i>

245
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,758
<i>It's so easy to talk
about myself without Lila,</i>

246
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:46,398
<i>events glide through time like luggage
on an airport conveyor belt.</i>

247
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,758
<i>It's harder to talk about
what happened to her</i>

248
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:53,918
<i>when I left with my hopes for living
and studying in Pisa.</i>

249
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,558
<i>The conveyer belt speeds up,
curves sharply,</i>

250
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:02,958
<i>the luggage falls off and opens,
spilling its contents everywhere.</i>

251
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,400
<i>And her items finish up
mixed in with mine.</i>

252
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,958
- Lila?
- Hi, Stefano.

253
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,920
I bought some pastries.

254
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,078
I took some to my mother's place,
Rino and Pinuccia were there for lunch.

255
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,280
My nephew's growing up
nice and strong.

256
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,240
Thanks.

257
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,480
What's wrong? Not hungry?

258
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,998
Just eat a little bit,
then we'll go to bed.

259
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,438
From tomorrow
I'm not going to the shop anymore.

260
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,160
- Why?
- Because I'm sick of it.

261
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,238
Who did you fight with,
Marcello or Michele?

262
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,360
That's not it.

263
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,718
Lila, be careful what you do.

264
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,478
Your brother and I are nearly
at their throats as it is.

265
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,798
- Don't complicate things.
- I don't want to complicate anything.

266
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,840
But I'm not going there anymore.

267
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,520
- Good, come back to the grocery store.
- I don't want to go there either.

268
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,320
You want to stay at home?

269
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,398
You're the one who wanted to work,
I didn't ask you to.

270
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,718
- Is that true?
- It's true.

271
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,120
- So stay at home, that suits me fine.
- I don't want to stay at home either.

272
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,358
If you don't want to stay at home,
what the fuck do you want?

273
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,198
- I want to go.
- Go, where?

274
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,680
Wherever I want. I'm leaving you.

275
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,318
We're husband and wife.

276
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,798
Husband and wife
don't leave each other.

277
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,480
I'm leaving just the same,
I don't want to be with you anymore.

278
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:56,600
I got everything wrong from the start.
I don't love you, I don't even like you.

279
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,800
I can't keep sleeping next to you.

280
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,758
Goddamnit!

281
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,800
Try it and I'll kill you
like they killed your father.

282
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,400
You wanna kill me? Then kill me.

283
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,280
You wanna go? Do what you want, go.

284
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:39,280
I gave you everything,
I let you do everything.

285
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,878
Is this how you thank me?

286
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,118
I raised you out of poverty,
I made your father rich, your brother,

287
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,240
that whole shitty family of yours.

288
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,880
You've ruined my appetite.

289
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,520
You can't even imagine
how much I love you.

290
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,000
You can't imagine.

291
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,400
Lila?

292
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,678
- Ada.
- What are you doing here?

293
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,880
- Am I disturbing you?
- Not at all.

294
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,520
Pasquale and Antonio are here.

295
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,198
Did you come about the unpaid accounts?
Come in.

296
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,120
- Ada, who is it?
- It's Stefano.

297
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,758
I'm glad you came,
I'll show you those accounts.

298
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,080
Sit down.

299
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,998
- Hi, Stefano.
- Evening.

300
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,680
Hi, Stefano.

301
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,400
- Sit down.
- Yes.

302
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,840
I'll get the list.

303
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,200
Thank you.

304
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,278
Okay, but...

305
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,598
I don't want to disturb you,
it's better if I see you tomorrow.

306
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,438
Just tell me whether they've paid.

307
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,600
No, none of them have,
we'll have to call them all again.

308
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:56,318
It'll be the third time I've called.
I'm sick of it, no more credit.

309
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,078
- They're not paying you?
- Not just them.

310
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,960
- Stefano...
- Thanks.

311
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,078
There's no money in the neighborhood.

312
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,918
We know that,

313
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,758
but that's no reason
to leave lots of debts everywhere.

314
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,758
Stefano...

315
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:31,398
I'm looking for a job,
I'm done with the workshop.

316
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,920
Could you help me?

317
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,240
I don't need anyone, Antonio.

318
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,160
Ask the Solaras.

319
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,640
The Solaras?

320
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,880
If you go to the Solaras
I'm done with you.

321
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,038
You hurt me, idiot!

322
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,638
- What happened?
- She hurt me.

323
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,398
I'll do it.

324
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,080
- But be careful, don't hurt me.
- How's Lila?

325
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,040
She's at home,
she's running a temperature.

326
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:14,198
In fact, I should go. Excuse me.

327
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,278
- Good night.
- Bye, Stefano.

328
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,440
- Bye, Ada.
- Bye.

329
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,358
Why did he come?

330
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,360
I'm going to see
what's wrong with Mamma.

331
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,800
Why are you crying?
Mamma loves you.

332
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,918
<i>Man wants to dominate storms and ice,</i>

333
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:53,718
<i>but he's still too far behind
and the sun still prevails.</i>

334
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,958
<i>So man plans to steal
the strength of the sun</i>

335
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,760
<i>and bend it
with his laboratory experiments.</i>

336
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,238
Stefano, what's going on?

337
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,998
I haven't heard from Lila for days,
you said she had a fever.

338
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,038
I came by and knocked yesterday, today.

339
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:19,280
No one answered.
Will you tell me how Lila is?

340
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,640
I don't know.

341
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:31,198
It's not true that she's sick.
She's gone, she's left me.

342
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,440
She's left me, she's gone!

343
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,720
Holy mother!

344
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,240
Where is she?

345
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,798
You've never understood
a thing about my sister.

346
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,878
She shouldn't have worked
with the Solaras.

347
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,158
Lila's always been a hothead.
What could Stefano do?

348
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,478
We should call the cops.

349
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,078
- And become the neighborhood joke.
- What do we care?

350
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,798
No, let's wait.

351
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,598
No.

352
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:13,520
What if something's happened to her?
Let's at least call the hospitals.

353
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,480
Hang on a minute...
Maybe she's gone to see Lenù.

354
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,398
Could be.

355
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,958
Maybe she was sick of working
and decided to take a trip.

356
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,638
Sure, Lila's always done that.

357
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,200
Whenever she's got a problem
she goes to Lenuccia.

358
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:46,278
Yes, but on her own,
taking the train to Pisa?

359
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,078
It's not easy.

360
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,118
Anyway she could have told us,
so we wouldn't worry.

361
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,198
- Tomorrow, I'll leave and go see.
- You have to work.

362
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,880
Lila has to be replaced
with a Cerullo or with a Carracci.

363
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,600
And seeing as I have this one
and Rino is definitely not capable...

364
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:14,600
- You're in the shoe store.
- Let's leave her alone.

365
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,760
Let's let her calm down.

366
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:27,678
- She's in Pisa, with Lenuccia.
- Yes. She's in Pisa.

367
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,880
She'll be back in a few days.

368
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,480
She's in Pisa...

369
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,038
She's in Pisa.

370
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,638
I don't give a fuck
if your sister takes trips to Pisa!

371
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,520
Who will I put in the store now?

372
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,198
Alfonso? Alfonso is a man.
We need a female with the customers.

373
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,918
Your sister's a bitch
and she's left us in the shit!

374
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,840
I don't give a shit,
just find her, that's all!

375
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,760
The fuck are you looking at?

376
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,880
Michele...

377
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,998
- I need a job.
- What do I care?

378
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,038
I was wondering,
with all the businesses you have...

379
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,638
- Get outta here!
- I have to support my family.

380
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,240
- Mamma's not well.
- I said get out, you deadbeat.

381
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,720
Antonio! Come back.

382
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,920
Do you know where Lila is?

383
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,080
- Tell me the truth.
- I don't know.

384
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,878
I got a job for you.

385
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:32,318
Everyone says she went to see Lenuccia
in Pisa, but I don't believe it.

386
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,598
Find her.

387
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:39,998
But Naples is big, so is Pisa.
Where do I begin?

388
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,640
With Sarratore's eldest son.

389
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,718
If you tell anyone you're doing
this search for me

390
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,558
I'll have you locked away in the asylum.

391
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,958
And I promise you'll never get out.

392
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:03,798
Everything you see, everything
you learn, you tell only me.

393
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,000
Got it?

394
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,840
All right.

395
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:25,318
<i>I return to earth,
among the simple hearts of my comrades,</i>

396
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:29,718
<i>great because our nation is great.</i>

397
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:34,118
<i>And I bring with me awareness
of a new sun</i>

398
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:38,838
<i>until today, lost in the future
and now conquered,</i>

399
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:43,560
<i>old hope of unforeseen love.</i>

400
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,878
Can we go now?

401
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,558
Who knows when we'll get another chance!
I want to see him.

402
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,720
Pier Paolo Pasolini.

403
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:20,838
Speaking of anger...
Who are the angry in Italy?

404
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:25,718
In Italy, unlike in the great
European bourgeoisies,

405
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,038
there are no "angry"...

406
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,478
He's just a faggot who stirs up trouble.

407
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,878
- Let's go.
- No, I want to hear him.

408
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,920
- Get outta here, pederast!
- Faggot!

409
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,560
Please!

410
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,800
I don't like him
or fascists either, let's go!

411
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,000
Fucking fascists!

412
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,198
It's late.

413
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,758
- Shall we turn in?
- You go, I'll join you.

414
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,598
Come on.
You can think about it tomorrow.

415
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,280
- No.
- What's wrong?

416
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:04,758
- You're overdoing it.
- What do you mean?

417
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:10,438
You make comments out loud,
if anyone hushes you, you attack them.

418
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,720
You're too familiar with people
who are older and more educated.

419
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:23,600
- I didn't do any of that.
- Not today, but all the other times.

420
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,840
And so?

421
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,078
You're too shy.

422
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,198
You still don't realize
you're better than them.

423
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,000
You'll do much more important things.

424
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:48,680
All right. I'll wait for you in bed.

425
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,800
They're not publishing
my article in <i>Il Mattino</i>.

426
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,800
Why didn't you tell me before?

427
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:06,758
Tomorrow, I'll call the editor
who used to come to the store.

428
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,478
I'll ask him what was wrong.

429
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:14,160
You simply don't get it.
You're not going to call anyone.

430
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,198
Why?

431
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,598
That asshole has never
been interested in me, only in you.

432
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,080
Did he come to the shoe store
to discuss politics?

433
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,798
He came because he liked you.

434
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,160
- That's not true.
- It is. I'm not stupid, Lila.

435
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,400
You're just creating problems for me.

436
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,798
- What do you mean?
- That I shouldn't listen to you.

437
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,440
You're confusing me,
you're like dripping water...

438
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:54,278
- It's either your way or the highway.
- You wrote the article.

439
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,598
Why did you make me
rewrite it four times?

440
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:01,480
- You wanted to rewrite it.
- Let's be clear.

441
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,158
Pick something for you, that you like.

442
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:09,000
Go back to selling shoes,
salami, do what you want.

443
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,800
But don't try to be
what you're not, it's ruining me.

444
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,360
If that's the case, get out now.

445
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,960
Hi, Bruno, it's Nino.

446
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,840
Fine. I need help,
I have to leave for a while.

447
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,480
I don't know where, but I have to go.

448
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,200
All right, I'm on my way.

449
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,000
Kid, are you getting on, or not?

450
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,560
Stay away, you're never
to see her again. Repeat!

451
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,200
You piece of shit!

452
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,560
You like taking
other guys' women? Repeat!

453
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,480
"I was wrong, I'll leave her."

454
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,600
- Repeat it!
- I'll leave her!

455
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,320
I'll leave her!

456
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,920
Now go away and don't come back.

457
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,000
What is it, Antonio?

458
00:48:55,160 --> 00:49:00,600
I need a favor.
I found Lila, we gotta help her.

459
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,120
- Do what?
- Go home.

460
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:09,078
- She didn't go to see Lenuccia.
- What, she didn't go there?

461
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:13,158
- She's living in a dump on her own.
- On her own?

462
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:17,318
- Why did she do that?
- No idea, I haven't spoken to her.

463
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,240
Why?

464
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,960
I found her for Michele Solara,
he asked me to stay at his disposal.

465
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,280
At his disposal?

466
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,680
- What for?
- Odd jobs.

467
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,238
Are you crazy?
You work for the Solaras now?

468
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:51,318
I didn't tell Michele I found her.
You go and get her.

469
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:57,118
- And take her home.
- Why? Lila was right to leave.

470
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,758
She finally got out of the shoe store.

471
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,718
If she realized marrying Stefano
was a mistake, I won't take her back.

472
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,838
You want to leave her
on her own and penniless?

473
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,718
Why, are we rich?

474
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:14,318
Lila knows life, she's got her reasons,
let's leave her in peace.

475
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,118
But she's always helped us.

476
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,238
If it's a matter of money
I'd be prepared to help her.

477
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,198
But I won't go get her,
she's a free woman.

478
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,960
And you're a piece of shit
for working with them.

479
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,400
Give me the address.

480
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,200
I'll go and see what she wants to do.

481
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,280
Do what you want.

482
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,760
Did you bring the fruit?

483
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:19,118
Leave it open, the neighbors
will get the wrong idea.

484
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,680
I don't give a fuck about the neighbors.

485
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,438
We're going now.

486
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,120
- Where?
- To your husband.

487
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,640
Did he send you?

488
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:08,840
- Who sent you?
- No one.

489
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,960
I'm not coming.

490
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,120
Then I'll stay here with you.

491
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,760
Forever?

492
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:42,640
- Until I convince you.
- And your job?

493
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,880
- I'm sick of it.
- And Carmela?

494
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,160
You were there first.

495
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,960
And you're much more important.

496
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:09,478
I'll tell her you said that,
she'll leave you.

497
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,240
I'll tell her.

498
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,000
I've already made up my mind.

499
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,400
I've had a thing for you
since we were kids.

500
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,998
I never told you because
you're too beautiful, too intelligent.

501
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,240
Whereas I'm short,
I'm not worth anything.

502
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,158
Now go back to your husband.

503
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:26,118
I don't know why you left him
and I don't want to know.

504
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:31,840
All I know is you can't stay here,
you don't deserve to live in this dump.

505
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,598
<i>In the end, Lila and Nino
lived together for only 23 days.</i>

506
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:31,998
<i>She didn't miss any of the comforts
she'd enjoyed after she married.</i>

507
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,278
<i>She wasn't saddened
by the separation from her family,</i>

508
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,358
<i>from Rino, from her little nephew.</i>

509
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:41,520
<i>She never worried
that her money would run out.</i>

510
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,680
I'll take you to the front door
and wait.

511
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,440
If he mistreats you,
I'll come up and kill him.

512
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:03,000
But he won't, on the contrary,
he'll be happy you've come back.

513
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:28,878
Now go up alone,
but let's make a pact.

514
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,278
If you can't get on with your husband,

515
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:37,558
I brought you to him
and I'll come back and get you.

516
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,400
Is that fair enough?

517
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,840
Lila?

518
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,200
You're back.

519
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,600
Come in.

520
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,960
You made us worry.

521
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:14,440
- What happened?
- I'm pregnant, Stefano.

522
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:21,760
- Lila...
- The baby's not yours.

1
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,598
- Lila, please...
- No.

2
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,760
- What are we doing?
- Now I'll show you.

3
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,280
Stop! Everyone's looking at us.

4
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,680
- Everyone has to see me.
- Why?

5
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,278
I said you'll see.

6
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,240
- Everyone has to see me.
- Enough! Let's go back.

7
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,240
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

8
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,078
- What can I get you?
- A tray of pastries.

9
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,678
Gigliola, a nice tray of pastries
for Signora Carracci.

10
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,480
Marcello, come and say hello.

11
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,758
It's weird hearing you called
"Signora Carracci".

12
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,718
- For me too.
- We saw you. Didn't we, Gigliola?

13
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,238
- Yesterday afternoon.
- It's true.

14
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,718
- Yesterday afternoon?
- That's right.

15
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,318
- At the Rettifilo.
- On display in the dressmaker's window.

16
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,920
There was a photo of you
in your wedding dress.

17
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,758
The dressmaker wanted a photograph,

18
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,158
but I didn't know
she'd put it in her window.

19
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,438
- Or I wouldn't have let her.
- Why?

20
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,518
- You looked so good in that dress.
- I want my photo in the window too.

21
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,278
That's if anyone marries you.

22
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,318
- You're marrying me, right?
- Elena wants to get married too.

23
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,518
- Since when?
- What?

24
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,518
I'd marry you even if you are four-eyed.

25
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,278
I'm sorry, Michele,
she's already engaged.

26
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,918
- With Antonio.
- Mind your own business.

27
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,678
It's just that, poor thing,

28
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,958
he's supposed to do military service.

29
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,080
There's no "supposed to",
if he's gotta go, he's gotta go.

30
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,080
It's not good news.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,718
We all know the situation
at Antonio's house.

32
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,278
Melina's what she is.
If he leaves, how will they get by?

33
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,080
What are you saying, Lila?
Explain it to me.

34
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,758
No one in this neighborhood
can help him,

35
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,358
except the Solara brothers.

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,358
- You razzing us?
- No, it's the truth.

37
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,278
Antonio doesn't deserve our help,

38
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,998
but to make Lenuccia happy,
'cause she's a good girl,

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,518
we can ask our friend
if there's anything he can do.

40
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,960
- Thank you, it's kind of you.
- Here, Lila.

41
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,318
I gave you the best ones.

42
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,118
And a few extra of the ones
your husband likes.

43
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,960
Thanks.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,918
- Don't even try, absolutely not.
- Don't start.

45
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,800
Don't worry, he'll pay later
out of his own pocket.

46
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,198
Let us know, then. Have a good day.

47
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,200
You looked beautiful in that photo.

48
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,718
- Thank you.
- You could see your shoes too.

49
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,400
- I don't remember.
- I do.

50
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,518
Do you want to put my photo
in here, too?

51
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,080
No, I'd never dare
in this neighborhood.

52
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,478
But I want to put a nice big one

53
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,318
in the shoe store we're opening
with your husband in Naples,

54
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,200
in Piazza dei Martiri.

55
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,200
A shoe store?
What's this about a shoe store?

56
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,998
I don't know anything
about your affairs.

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,558
Everyone knows and you know nothing?

58
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,920
Don't you know
what your husband does?

59
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,118
You're clever.

60
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,958
If the dressmaker put your photo
in the window for advertising,

61
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,598
we'll put one in too,
to sell Cerullo shoes.

62
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,318
Don't talk to me,
you need to talk to Stefano.

63
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,720
He's the one who decides.

64
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,238
I don't know or decide anything.
Have a good day.

65
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,600
Goodbye.

66
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,720
Lila!

67
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,358
It didn't work out between us
and that's fine, that's how it went,

68
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,718
but I don't want things
left unclear between us

69
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,758
and I don't want to be blamed
for things I didn't do.

70
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,718
I know your husband says
I took the shoes as an insult.

71
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,918
But I swear in front of Lenuccia:

72
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,598
he and your brother
wanted me to have the shoes

73
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,800
to show there were no hard feelings,
it wasn't my idea.

74
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,998
You're like children blaming each other.

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,238
- Don't you believe me?
- No, Marcello, I believe you.

76
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,558
But what you say

77
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,238
and what my father, my brother
and my husband say...

78
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,960
I don't give a damn anymore.

79
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,080
Lenù.

80
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,000
Are you okay?

81
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,480
Yes, thanks.

82
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,238
What are you doing at home?

83
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,680
- Why did you go to Bar Solara?
- I bought pastries.

84
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,480
- Dressed like that?
- Why, don't I look nice?

85
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,958
- Like a pastry, Lenù?
- No, thanks.

86
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,600
I'm going home for dinner soon.

87
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,000
- Who was at the bar?
- Your friends.

88
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,038
They paid me a heap of compliments.

89
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,400
- Right, Lenù?
- Lila...

90
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,000
They looked at me like
they'd never seen a female before.

91
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,918
They told me the dressmaker
put my photo in her window.

92
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,440
Michele wants to display it
in the store in Piazza dei Martiri.

93
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,920
- And you said it was all right?
- I said they have to talk to you.

94
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,600
I didn't know anything about the store.

95
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,838
Lenù, you're a respectable girl,

96
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,798
will you explain to your friend
that I work all day long?

97
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,518
I work my ass off
so she doesn't want for anything.

98
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,638
I give work to everyone,
my family and hers.

99
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,960
I work in this neighborhood
and she can't make me look like a fool.

100
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,080
Either you tell her or I'll have to.

101
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,518
It's getting late.

102
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,120
We need to have a talk.
Say hello to Mamma and Papa.

103
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,760
I'll stay if you like.

104
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,678
He's just an asshole.

105
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,238
If you provoke him,
he'll beat you to death.

106
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,598
His beatings do nothing to me.
Afterwards, I'm better than before.

107
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,398
He can make all the money he wants
with whoever he wants,

108
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,600
but he can't have a woman
like the one he has in mind.

109
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,518
"I have to work in this neighborhood."

110
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,280
"I give work to everyone,
my family and hers."

111
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,798
Lila, come here! Come here!

112
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,440
Lila!

113
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,360
Open up!

114
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,600
Stefano! Stop it! Don't hurt her!

115
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,758
- Lila!
- Goddamn it to hell!

116
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,080
- Open up!
- Bitch!

117
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,600
Lila...

118
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,598
- Lenù.
- What is it?

119
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,440
You're so beautiful.

120
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,598
- I have something to tell you.
- Is it good or bad?

121
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,320
- Something I did for you.
- What happened?

122
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,320
Lila talked to the Solaras.

123
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,640
They offered to help you
get out of military service.

124
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,960
Marcello said he'll take care of it.

125
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:53,880
They'll take care of it.
They'll do it for sure.

126
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,840
What did you do?

127
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,160
What did you do, Lenù?

128
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,840
I never asked you to talk
to the Solaras! Don't you see?

129
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,478
You made me look like a guy
who sends his woman to ask for favors.

130
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,478
From the people I despise most
in the neighborhood!

131
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,880
- It's not like that...
- Shut up! Shut up!

132
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,038
You and your friend, who thinks
she's queen of the neighborhood

133
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,358
because now she's Signora Carracci.

134
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,758
If Pasquale and Enzo find out,
they'll spit at me and they'd be right.

135
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,358
You humiliated me.

136
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,520
Now you can go find the poet's son,
you and me are over.

137
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,358
Antonio, what are you saying?
I did it for you, for us.

138
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,600
It's over, it's over for good.

139
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,758
<i>I was angry with Lila and
I didn't want to see her for a while.</i>

140
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,038
<i>I thought about how she used me
to provoke the Solaras,</i>

141
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,238
<i>to get revenge on her husband.</i>

142
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,398
<i>I thought about how she got dressed up,</i>

143
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,960
<i>about how much the humiliation
and suffering were making her mean.</i>

144
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,478
<i>Since she'd become Signora Carracci
she changed more every day.</i>

145
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,760
Don't complain!
We're lucky we can still buy meat.

146
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,598
- No, leave it.
- I'll give you a hand.

147
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,960
No, I'll do it.

148
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,878
Stefano Carracci asked me if you will
accompany him to the Rettifilo.

149
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,318
- What for?
- I don't know.

150
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,038
What did you tell him?

151
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,758
How was I supposed to answer
Stefano Carracci asking us for a favor?

152
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,958
Why doesn't he go with his wife?

153
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,158
The whole neighborhood wonders
what those two do at night.

154
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,198
Do they play cards,
watch television all night?

155
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,918
- That's why she's not pregnant.
- Maybe she's busy.

156
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,838
Anyway, we have to be nice
to the Carraccis.

157
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,598
When I go shopping they give me credit.

158
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,678
Did I say anything?
But tell me something.

159
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,278
At night, have you ever heard me say:
"No, I'm tired, let's play cards"?

160
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,558
No! Because you're not
a respectable person.

161
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,398
Do you want me
to become a respectable person?

162
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,758
A little bit, but not too much.

163
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,520
- Mamma, we're going downstairs.
- All right.

164
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,118
Can I hang out the washing with you?

165
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,838
- But I'll carry the laundry.
- No, I'll carry it.

166
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,520
You can carry the clothespins.

167
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,680
- Who is it at this hour?
- You go.

168
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,238
Stefano, hello.

169
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,758
Excuse the intrusion,
seeing as I am busy later,

170
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,358
I wondered if Elena could come now.

171
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,958
- Come in.
- Good morning, Stefano.

172
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,758
- A coffee before you go?
- Thanks, but I'm in a hurry.

173
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,438
I bet a young man like you
has very important things to do!

174
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,318
Lenuccia's ready. Come, Lenù.

175
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,398
Don Vittorio, what's the word in Naples?
Do you have to go back to work?

176
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,800
Come.

177
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,558
Hi, Stefano.

178
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,878
- Hi, Lenù.
- What do we have to do?

179
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,278
We have to go to the dressmaker
who made Lila's dress.

180
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,478
Let's just say
I need your special skills.

181
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,518
- I have to study today.
- Go out for a drive.

182
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,120
Go!

183
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,998
Don Vittorio,
thank you so much, have a good day.

184
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,518
A good day to you, too.

185
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,478
- I'll bring her right back.
- Whenever you want.

186
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,918
Let's go.

187
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,360
- Have fun.
- Thank you.

188
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,880
If you don't move we'll be here all day!

189
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,878
She's the most beautiful
and clever girl I ever met,

190
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,198
but she doesn't want
to act like a woman.

191
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,120
You get me?

192
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,238
How can I explain to people
what my wife's like?

193
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,920
They don't know anything
about my troubles.

194
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,560
Know what she says?
That all I think about is money.

195
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,238
Maybe she's right.
But why do I do it, in your opinion?

196
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,118
I do it for the family,
for her father, for her brother,

197
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,558
for the kids that are gonna come.

198
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,040
Shouldn't they have a life
like mine, better than mine?

199
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,920
Am I wrong?

200
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,640
You're educated, tell me if I'm wrong.

201
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:07,080
I don't know what she wants.
Does she want to be poor again?

202
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,240
Or can only the Solaras make money
in this neighborhood?

203
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,960
We gonna move here, or not?

204
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,240
Go!

205
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,878
The car, the new house, the new grocery
store, the shoe store downtown...

206
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,600
Shouldn't a woman enjoy all that stuff?
Shouldn't she be happy?

207
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,600
Shouldn't she hold her husband
at night and say "come here"?

208
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,958
You're not talking,
but you agree with me.

209
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,200
Because I'm right.

210
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,078
There's a reason
men and women get married,

211
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,878
but she doesn't want me.

212
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,158
I sleep with her every night
and I can't touch her,

213
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,840
I can't make her see
how much I love her.

214
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,920
I don't know
if she tells you these things.

215
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,878
I have to touch her, Lenù. I'm a man.

216
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,440
We're married, but she behaves
like she doesn't get it.

217
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,358
She has this force inside
I can't explain.

218
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,000
An evil force, a poison.

219
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,800
Why doesn't she get pregnant?
I'm losing my mind.

220
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,680
Everyone in the neighborhood asks me.

221
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,078
Friends, family, even customers.

222
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,998
With little grins on their faces,
they ask me: "Any news?"

223
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,760
I pretend I don't understand.
Or what should I tell them, the truth?

224
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,080
My wife kills the babies in her belly
with that evil force of hers.

225
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,000
She does it on purpose,
I'm telling you.

226
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,560
She wants me to look like an asshole
to the whole neighborhood.

227
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,958
But now she has to agree
to work in the new grocery store

228
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,678
and she has to help me out
with the books,

229
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,600
so she'll grow up
and stop being so spiteful.

230
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:58,478
<i>I was stunned, I'd never heard
a man talk about himself like that.</i>

231
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,278
<i>His language
was full of feeling, defenseless,</i>

232
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,678
<i>like in certain songs.</i>

233
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,438
<i>I liked the importance
he ascribed to me,</i>

234
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,878
<i>it felt as if he saw in me
a beneficient power</i>

235
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,320
<i>capable of getting the better
of Lila's evil one. I was flattered.</i>

236
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,518
Ada, tell Mamma
I'll be back in half an hour.

237
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,080
Yeah, I'll tell her.

238
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,560
- Thank you.
- I thank you, Lenù.

239
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,440
Let's not tell Lila we spoke.

240
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,840
There's no need, okay?

241
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,518
But try to talk to her,
maybe you'll make her see reason.

242
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,840
Help her behave
like a wife, not an enemy.

243
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,520
Help me make her understand.

244
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,318
All right.

245
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,480
I'll do what I can
to see you two are happy.

246
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,240
- Who is it?
- Elena.

247
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:25,358
- Long time no see.
- I had to help Elisa with school.

248
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,518
Those two are here,

249
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,000
but they've done what they came to do,
they're just leaving.

250
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,158
- Hi, Pinuccia.
- Lenù, how are you?

251
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,680
Good.

252
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,078
- Hi, Lenù.
- Hi, Rino.

253
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,798
- How are you?
- Good, you?

254
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:08,478
What a coincidence. Every time
you come you find these two.

255
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,560
Lila, don't be a hypocrite.

256
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,240
Where are we supposed
to meet, out in the fields?

257
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,678
- Is there anything to eat? I'm starving.
- No, there's nothing.

258
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,078
You don't cook for your husband?

259
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,478
- Do I have to answer to you too?
- Rino, cut it out.

260
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,280
What's wrong, you're on edge?

261
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,240
- Get off me.
- What a beautiful sister I got, eh?

262
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:43,320
Pinuccia, the Solaras want to put
Lila's photo in the shoe store.

263
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,678
I don't think it's appropriate.

264
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,478
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

265
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,158
Lila can put it in the new grocery
store. You're running it, right?

266
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,280
Yes, I'm bringing Carmela in
to work with me.

267
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,318
You got Ada a job,
now you'll give Carmela one?

268
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,798
She needs it.

269
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,398
Seeing as my brother said

270
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,838
that I'll be at Piazza dei Martiri,
I'll decide what goes in there.

271
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,120
- Make that clear to the Solaras.
- Yeah, all right...

272
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,920
Anyway, the thing about
the photo's not bullshit.

273
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,400
I think it has huge
commercial potential.

274
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,638
- Lady Sister doesn't want to talk?
- Maybe you better go.

275
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,398
I've had it up to here
with the photograph.

276
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,960
I'm going.

277
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,158
- We'll be back tomorrow.
- Come back alone. We need to talk.

278
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,000
Have a good day.

279
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:49,478
Lenù, do you think Lila's photo
should go in the shoe store?

280
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,318
I don't think Stefano
will give permission.

281
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,280
Yesterday he went to get it
from the dressmaker.

282
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,918
If he went to get it,
it wasn't to give it to the Solaras.

283
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,680
You're so clever.

284
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,800
Wanna bet you're wrong?

285
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,878
If the Solaras ask,
Stefano will give them permission.

286
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,838
No, Lila, Stefano's not like that.

287
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,158
The shoes are another matter,
but he loves you. Don't exaggerate.

288
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,440
- It's true.
- You wanna bet?

289
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:31,000
- I don't have any money.
- Who said anything about money?

290
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,878
If you lose,

291
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,040
you can't ever pass again
without A or A+.

292
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,998
I don't even know
if I'll pass this year.

293
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,918
Precisely.

294
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,000
You mustn't fall behind
with your studies again.

295
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:56,398
- And if you lose?
- I'll enroll in a private school.

296
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,598
I'll start studying again and I swear
I'll get my diploma with you.

297
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,560
Actually, I'll do better than you.

298
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,200
Let's bet.

299
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,238
Stop acting crazy as usual.

300
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,880
You have the new grocery store now.
Why do you want to study?

301
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,838
Besides, I'd like to know
when you're gonna make me an aunt.

302
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,718
Who knows.

303
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,998
At this rate I'll be a mamma before you.

304
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,160
If you're always glued to Rino,
it's possible.

305
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,198
How dare you?
Who do you think I am?

306
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,518
You've lost your mind. You think
you're Lady Fucking High and Mighty!

307
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:51,118
- I'm not even going to answer you.
- No one can ever tell you a secret!

308
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,960
Enough, I'm leaving too.

309
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,680
- Bye, Lenù.
- Bye, Pinuccia.

310
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,120
Are you really thinking
of going back to school?

311
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,278
It would be nice.

312
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,000
I saw Pasquale and Ada the other night.

313
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,878
We went to get pizza.

314
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,078
What? With Stefano too?

315
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,480
No, by myself.

316
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,998
- Did they invite you?
- I asked them.

317
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,078
Stefano doesn't say anything
if you go out alone?

318
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,318
Getting married doesn't mean
living like an old person.

319
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:48,120
If he wants to come with me, fine,
if he's tired I go out alone.

320
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,600
I went to get gelato with Antonio too.

321
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,920
- When?
- Yesterday afternoon.

322
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,760
- How is he?
- Good.

323
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,200
He's going in September.

324
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,838
Did he ask about me?

325
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,000
Why did you tell him
we spoke to Marcello?

326
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,478
I told you he wouldn't accept.

327
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,518
Besides, you know Marcello
wouldn't do anything for Antonio.

328
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,278
Too bad for him.

329
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,158
I understand him.

330
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,920
He doesn't want
to get mixed up with them.

331
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,398
- Stefano does.
- Lila, you've got to stop it.

332
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,758
Stefano loves you.

333
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:49,278
He lets you go out with your friends,
he's giving you a job in the new store.

334
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,078
He's always working,
he wants you to be a lady.

335
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,920
What do you know about Stefano?

336
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,840
What do you know about
what I put up with every night?

337
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,398
- You talk but you don't know anything.
- I'm on your side.

338
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,960
- I just wanted to help you.
- What do you know?

339
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:15,358
The only thing he asks you for is
legitimate, any husband would ask.

340
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,358
Let's hear it, what's he asking for?

341
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,478
You know.
Why don't you make an effort?

342
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,678
You're married, everyone's waiting
for you to have a baby.

343
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,118
Did you know that Melina
hardly eats anything?

344
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,158
What little she does eat, she throws up.

345
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,918
Did you know Giuseppina Peluso
has palpitations and can't sleep?

346
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:39,560
When she visits her husband in jail,
on the way back she cries unconsolably.

347
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,240
The very idea of getting
pregnant disgusts me!

348
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,440
Bear with me, I'm tired now.

349
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,080
I want to be alone.

350
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,480
I'll see you.

351
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,160
Giuseppina...

352
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,200
Lenù! You've grown so pretty.

353
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,680
- How are you?
- How should I be... fine.

354
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:59,478
- We get by the best we can.
- I know.

355
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,040
If it weren't for Carmela and Pasquale
giving me the strength to go on...

356
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,120
It's hard.

357
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,960
Say hi to Mamma and Papa.

358
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,680
Elena, come here a moment.

359
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,478
He's so beautiful.

360
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,478
- How's school?
- So-so.

361
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,078
You're smart, and it's not long to go.

362
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,478
When school's over you gotta
give me a hand with the girls.

363
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,798
Take them to the beach like last year.

364
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,518
- All right.
- I'll give you a little more money.

365
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,078
You deserve it.

366
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,558
- I don't know...
- Of course you do!

367
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,640
Don't forget now! Bye.

368
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,240
Stay here!

369
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,798
If I catch you I'll kill you!

370
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,200
You're worse than
that shameless father of yours!

371
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,120
I'll break your bones one by one!
Ciro, where are you going?

372
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,038
<i>I suddenly realized that,</i>

373
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,160
<i>without being aware of it,
I had tapped into Lila's feelings.</i>

374
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,038
<i>She was engaged in a mysterious fight</i>

375
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,080
<i>to destroy the life Stefano wanted
at all costs to fit her into.</i>

376
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:09,518
<i>She didn't want to become like
our mothers, neighbors and relatives,</i>

377
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,438
<i>who looked like they had lost
their female features.</i>

378
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,638
<i>They had been eaten away by the bodies
of husbands, fathers, brothers</i>

379
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,440
<i>whom they ended up resembling.</i>

380
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,758
<i>Did this transformation begin
with pregnancy?</i>

381
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,038
<i>With housework, with being beaten?</i>

382
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,598
<i>Would Lila's delicate face burst
open to reveal her father's?</i>

383
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,040
<i>And would my parents
emerge from my body?</i>

384
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,120
PASS

385
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,120
Greco!

386
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,718
Are you happy? Then smile.

387
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,120
Miss Galiani left some books
for you, I'll go get them.

388
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,680
- Miss!
- Hi.

389
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,238
I left you some books with Nando,
they'll help you to reason.

390
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,158
Thank you, Miss, I'll go get them.

391
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,598
- You didn't study much this year.
- Yes, I know.

392
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,200
Start studying seriously.

393
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,880
I mean it, don't waste all this.
If you waste it, you'll be sorry later.

394
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:06,478
I have to go, the exams are about
to start. Come up, if you like.

395
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,558
- Is that Sarratore's class?
- Yes, final year.

396
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,440
I'll see you up there.

397
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,158
- Here are the books.
- Thank you.

398
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,600
See you.

399
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,238
Good evening.

400
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,278
- Is Maestra Oliviero in?
- The doctor's examining her.

401
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,998
Attilia, who is it?

402
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,918
My name's Greco,
I'm an ex-pupil of hers.

403
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:13,998
- It's Greco.
- Let her in.

404
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,158
I can come back another time.

405
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,360
Come now,
they're sending her to the hospital.

406
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,320
Elena! Come.

407
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,280
- Good evening, Doctor.
- Good evening.

408
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:42,118
- How are you?
- I'm well.

409
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:48,640
- Did you pass the year?
- Yes, but don't think about me.

410
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,918
- What happened?
- Nothing.

411
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,280
It's nothing.

412
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:08,078
Elena, you're smart,

413
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,040
you're very smart.

414
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,160
Not really...

415
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,798
I didn't get a scholarship this year.

416
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,918
That's no good.

417
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,160
Keep still, madam.

418
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,478
I'm sorry, but this year
I can't give you any books.

419
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,958
Forgive me.

420
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,240
Don't worry about me,
think about getting better.

421
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,400
They're taking me to the hospital now.

422
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,400
I'll be all right, don't worry.

423
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,120
I'll be fine.

424
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,800
Rest now.

425
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,038
Girls, stay here! Don't go too far!

426
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,760
Yes, Lenù.

427
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,640
- Guess who it is!
- It's Marisa.

428
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,718
- Alfonso!
- Hi, Lenù.

429
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,400
What are you doing here?

430
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,638
- We came to take a dip.
- I thought you were on Ischia.

431
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,120
No, Alfonso stayed here
so I thought I'd stay with him.

432
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,758
What can I say...?

433
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,240
At Lila's wedding we made a connection.

434
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,280
Yes, I figured as much.

435
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,838
Nino? How did he do
with his final exams?

436
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,998
Straight As.

437
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,680
After the results
he left for England without a cent.

438
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,238
He'll work there
until he learns English.

439
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:19,478
- And University?
- I don't know, maybe Economics.

440
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,880
But he keeps changing his mind.

441
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,480
- Is that Lila and Antonio?
- Yes.

442
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,598
Stefano was busy at the new store

443
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,120
and he asked Antonio to bring us.

444
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,080
Lila has something to tell you.

445
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,478
- Hi.
- Hi.

446
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,398
- Hi.
- Antonio!

447
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,238
- Antonio!
- Grazia!

448
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,798
- How are you?
- Good.

449
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,358
- Wanna go for a swim?
- Yes.

450
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,878
- You've learned to swim?
- I don't know how to swim?

451
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,358
Let's say...

452
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,638
- I know how to swim.
- Come on, then!

453
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,158
Lila, I'm going for a swim.

454
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,160
- Shall we go for a swim too?
- Yes.

455
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,440
- You coming with us?
- No, thanks.

456
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,720
17 years of shit.

457
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,918
- What is it?
- A book on the origins of inequality.

458
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,040
- Who gave it to you?
- My Latin teacher.

459
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:03,278
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't think you'd be interested.

460
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,920
- You know what I'm interested in?
- Calm down.

461
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,600
When I finish it I'll lend it to you.

462
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,118
Did you know
that Nino's gone to England?

463
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:33,078
- Nino, who?
- You're saying that on purpose?

464
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:36,318
The guy in the wedding photo,
Marisa's brother.

465
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,280
- The ugly one you like?
- I don't like him.

466
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,360
- But he does great things.
- What?

467
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,400
He travels, he studies...
He's even learning English.

468
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,878
You and I could do those things too.

469
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,718
Travel, work as waitresses
to support ourselves.

470
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:02,798
- Has he finished school?
- He got his diploma this year.

471
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,760
- Is he smart?
- He's as smart as you.

472
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:20,078
There's trouble with the store
in Piazza dei Martiri.

473
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,398
What?

474
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,518
Michele wants Gigliola to work there,
Rino wants Pinuccia.

475
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,638
They were tearing each other's hair out.

476
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,558
How did it end?

477
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,760
Stefano stepped in,
they're both going to work there.

478
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,480
Good.

479
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,638
As long as Stefano accepts
one condition.

480
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,360
- What?
- Guess.

481
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,000
How should I know....?

482
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,080
Stefano gave them the photo.

483
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,678
You lost the bet.

484
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,878
I told you it was only a matter of time.

485
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,520
Study hard next year,
you have to get all top grades.

486
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,720
Lenù...

487
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,160
I'm pregnant.

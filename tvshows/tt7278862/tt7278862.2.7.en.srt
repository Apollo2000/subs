1
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,918
I asked you the exact date of the letter
in which Verga asserts his adhesion

2
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,200
to verist poetics,
and to whom it was written.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,798
I don't know.

4
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,158
We're talking about
an obtuse conservative.

5
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,038
That's enough, Mari.

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,078
Studying seriously

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,998
doesn't mean merely reading
an author in an ideological key,

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,598
but also contextualizing,
memorizing critical dates.

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,880
Professor...

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,078
Things are happening out there
that are too interesting

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,158
to allow me to focus solely
on your course.

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,758
Forgive me if I say so.

13
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,920
My dear Mari,
your position does you credit.

14
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,078
What does you less credit, and
I think you realize this on your own,

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,718
is showing up here so ill-prepared,
knowing what you risk.

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,718
You must learn
to make better use of your time.

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,880
- There's only one way to use time well.
- Let's hear it.

18
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,918
To make revolution.

19
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,880
Fine... Look, I want to help you.

20
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,440
Your exam doesn't
deserve more than a D.

21
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,158
I'm sorry, you'll lose
your place at the Normale University.

22
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,560
And you'll have plenty of time
to make revolution.

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,360
Thank you, Professor.

24
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,840
I didn't deserve more.

25
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,518
- Here he is.
- Well?

26
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,998
- All good.
- Grade?

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,358
It doesn't matter, it went well.

28
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,518
- Let's go to the beach like we said.
- Yeah, come on.

29
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,678
Giulia said she'll come into my room...

30
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,078
- Are you staying with me tonight?
- Yes.

31
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,158
I want to be alone with you, okay?
No, you guys go without us.

32
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,998
We're off.
I'll have the caretaker let you in.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,798
- Are you ditching us?
- Elena, convince him!

34
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,518
We're all wasting away,
let's go eat macaroni...

35
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,838
- Apologize to her.
- Are you insane?

36
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,198
- Let go of him!
- He was kidding.

37
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,678
- I was just kidding.
- Fuck you!

38
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,598
- Franco, come back! Don't be stupid!
- Fuck you!

39
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,880
Let's get them, come on! Careful.

40
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,280
Franco!

41
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,720
Run, run!

42
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,120
- Where are we going?
- Away from everyone!

43
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,998

<i>It's time, it's time

50
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,960
There they are, they're catching up!
Come, come!

51
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,718
Elena, they have to respect you more.

52
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,878
You stay silent, you smile...
Stand up for yourself.

53
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,960
- Promise me you will?
- Yes.

54
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,078
Come with me.

55
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,718
- Good morning.
- Hello.

56
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,598
We'd like to try on
the herringbone coat in the window.

57
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,238
- The one in pure virgin wool?
- Pure virgin wool, yes.

58
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,318
- Is the size the young lady's?
- My wife's size? Yes.

59
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,398
- I see, I'll go get it.
- Thank you.

60
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Marta, can you give me a hand?

61
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,478
- Franco, I don't need it.
- Yes, you do.

62
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,838
You've only got this old coat.

63
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,118
- This old coat will do just fine.
- But this one's warmer.

64
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,838
- It's not right.
- Yes, it is.

65
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,158
No, it's not.
You've already given me too many gifts.

66
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:19,078
- Clothes, my glasses, trips... enough.
- But I'm rich, Elena.

67
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,920
Very rich.

68
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,718
And you have nothing.
Besides, you deserve them.

69
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,078
- Miss, may I?
- Do you mind if I do it?

70
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,760
Not at all.

71
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,920
Look. You're beautiful.

72
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,200
It's people like you who are deprived
of the most innocent rights.

73
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,560
Did you see how sad
those workers were?

74
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,318
The true injustice is because of people
like me, they have to live like that.

75
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,040
- Franco...
- No.

76
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,360
Are you already awake?

77
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,880
- Don't you want to sleep a bit longer?
- I'm not sleepy.

78
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,798
You'd better go, Elena.

79
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,920
Go back to the college,
if you're seen here, it'll be a mess.

80
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,720
I'll go in a minute.

81
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,400
What's wrong?

82
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,040
- I'm leaving.
- Going where? To join the others?

83
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,960
No, you don't get it.

84
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:27,038
I'm going away. Enough, I'm done here.

85
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,638
- Is this one of your jokes?
- Yesterday I got a D.

86
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,480
I lost my place at the Normale.

87
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,958
What? Why didn't you tell me?

88
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,000
Because I don't care,
I don't want to stay here.

89
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,400
Elena?

90
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:05,040
Don't be like that.
Look, I really don't care. Elena...

91
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,438
The world needs changing,
I don't have time to study for exams.

92
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,200
Can't you see?

93
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,878
These have been wonderful years for me,

94
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,480
but enough now.

95
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,758
I'm not methodical like you,

96
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,360
or constant, I don't have
your drive to make it.

97
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,640
What should I do, Elena?

98
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,400
Say things like:
we'll stay in touch, I'll visit you?

99
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,880
I don't want to set foot
here in Pisa ever again.

100
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,640
For the rest of my life.

101
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,078
<i>Franco Mari,
in my first years at university,</i>

102
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:43,080
<i>taught me how to live, to make love,
to study, to have fun, to think.</i>

103
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,918
<i>I loved him,</i>

104
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,560
<i>I loved his restless body even though
I never considered it indispensable.</i>

105
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,878
<i>And then it happened as he had said.
We wrote for a while then that was it.</i>

106
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:03,400
<i>He didn't return to Pisa and
for a long time I had no news of him.</i>

107
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:33,318
<i>That winter a long, lonely period began,
I had nothing to do but study.</i>

108
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,718
<i>Since Franco had exited my life,</i>

109
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,638
<i>that same fear that had gripped me
when I first arrived in Pisa,</i>

110
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,160
<i>reared up again.</i>

111
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,318
<i>Franco's presence
had masked my real condition,</i>

112
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,318
<i>but hadn't changed it</i>

113
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,800
<i>and after three years
I still hadn't truly integrated.</i>

114
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,360
WOMEN'S COLLEGE HALLS OF RESIDENCE

115
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,680
Lenù, where are you?

116
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,598
Holy Mother, Lenù, where are you?

117
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,240
Ma...?

118
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,040
Ma, I'm here.

119
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,720
Ma... Help me.

120
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,040
I'm here.

121
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,560
Here you are, Lenù.

122
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,758
Holy Mother... Took me long enough!

123
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,358
There's no one here, it's deserted.

124
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,240
You're all alone, girl.
Let me see you.

125
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,320
You're so pale.

126
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,680
What have you done to your hair?

127
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,760
You still got a temperature.
I'll take care of you.

128
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,880
- What? What are you looking at?
- What are you doing here?

129
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,718
You said you weren't coming,
that you had a fever.

130
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,958
Was I s'posed to leave you all alone?

131
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,398
How did you get here?
Who came with you?

132
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,240
Who was gonna come, your father?
As if!

133
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,158
I came by train.

134
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,758
By train?
But had you ever taken a train?

135
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,040
No, but there had to be a first time.

136
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,520
Stay still, you've got a temperature.
Now I'll fix it.

137
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,038
I made you some broth,
I'll heat it up for you.

138
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,400
Is there a kitchen, a stove?

139
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,838
- Down the stairs and to the right.
- Why isn't there anybody in the college?

140
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,400
They've all gone home.

141
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,200
- Where do I go?
- Down the stairs, then to the right.

142
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,800
Lenù?

143
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,200
Mamma's girl, sit up. Come on.

144
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,878
You have to drink it.

145
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,960
- I don't want to.
- You have to, it's good for you.

146
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,840
- I'll do it.
- Then what am I doing here?

147
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,998
Your brothers and sister
always ask about you.

148
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,918
- How are they?
- They're growing up.

149
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,840
Which means that
your father and I are getting old.

150
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,718
The neighborhood's the same,
same families in the building,

151
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,438
it's like nothing ever moves.

152
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,800
Then I look in the mirror
and I realize time is moving.

153
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,600
Time's passing for you, too,
it passes for everybody.

154
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,000
- Enough.
- A little more. A little more!

155
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,600
All right, then.
I'll heat it up for you later, rest now.

156
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,438
It seems Stefano Carracci
is drowning in debt.

157
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,398
One year he buys a sports car

158
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,640
and the next he ends up
in Signora Solara's red book.

159
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,400
The Solaras grab everything,
we all know that.

160
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,758
Lila thought she'd arrived
who knows where,

161
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,638
but look where she is today.

162
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:23,280
A wedding fit for a princess,
nice clothes, the new house...

163
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,200
You're much better
than her, and prettier.

164
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,798
Your father tells everyone:
"My daughter's in Pisa!"

165
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,678
As if he were talking about
the King's palace.

166
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,280
And this is Pisa...

167
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,200
Take a picture. Just me, not the baby.

168
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,080
Further back. Take a picture of me.

169
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,200
Auntie Lenù...

170
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,638
Now undress her, wash her,

171
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,480
change her diaper and her swaddling.

172
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,040
What's wrong, Lenù? What happened?

173
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,678
Nothing, Mamma.
Just a bad dream.

174
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,800
Sleep.

175
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,398
<i>I hadn't thought about Lila
after what happened with Nino.</i>

176
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,038
<i>I'd had no idea what she was doing.</i>

177
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,278
<i>On one of my rare trips home
she invited me to lunch</i>

178
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,440
<i>and gave me some notebooks.</i>

179
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,960
<i>She made me swear I'd never read them.</i>

180
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,718
<i>They were words gathered
over the years, dangerous words,</i>

181
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,118
<i>that's what she said.</i>

182
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,840
<i>If Stefano found them, he might
have killed her and the baby.</i>

183
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,000
You're back.

184
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,000
Come in.

185
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,480
You had us worried.

186
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,000
- What happened?
- I'm pregnant, Stefano.

187
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,960
- Lila...
- The baby's not yours.

188
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,078
That's enough now. Come here.

189
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,118
I said it's not yours! Did you hear me?

190
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,840
- It's not yours!
- Lila, stop it!

191
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,440
I'm so happy.

192
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,318
I know, I treated you badly,
but now let's stop.

193
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,998
Don't say these bad things to me.

194
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,718
What am I to do with you?
What do you want?

195
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,358
I don't want to work anymore.

196
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,560
Neither at Piazza dei Martiri,
nor in the grocery store.

197
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:07,440
I don't want to see anyone.
Friends, family, especially the Solaras.

198
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:16,360
I want to stay at home and be a wife.
And bring up my child.

199
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,760
And you mustn't ever touch me again.

200
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,800
All right. All right, now come here.

201
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,998
We did it.

202
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,438
<i>Lila knew people lie to themselves
to defend themselves from the truth,</i>

203
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,800
<i>but she was shocked by how convincingly
her husband could lie to himself.</i>

204
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,478
<i>And she really did confine herself
to the apartment,</i>

205
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,918
<i>showing no curiosity
about Stefano's business,</i>

206
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,918
<i>her brother's or her father's.</i>

207
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:06,118
Lila, open up.
I know you're in there.

208
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,240
You can't do this to me.

209
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,398
You can't do this to me!

210
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,398
The Solaras are on my back,
they're pissed you left!

211
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,200
Your husband thinks about himself
and doesn't pay, what can I do?

212
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,320
I need you, Lila.

213
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,240
I'm all on my own,
I need you to help me.

214
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,000
With the shoes,
with the store, with money...

215
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,880
I feel totally lost.

216
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,240
You can't always do as you please!

217
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,240
Bitch!

218
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:31,478
<i>She felt she'd become big and swollen,
inside more than out.</i>

219
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:36,518
<i>She saw her belly as a meat balloon
that expanded as the baby blew</i>

220
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,398
<i>and she feared
what she'd always feared most:</i>

221
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,200
<i>that she'd break open, spill out.</i>

222
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,520
Lila, open up!

223
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,798
I know you're in there.
What are you hiding from?

224
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,558
Who the fuck d'you think you are, bitch?

225
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,478
You and I had a deal,
you haven't kept up your end.

226
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,040
I needed new shoe styles,
you were supposed to design them.

227
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:09,240
Slut! Slut, open up!

228
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,280
I'll be back.

229
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,000
Push harder, you're nearly there!

230
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,440
One more!

231
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,760
Good! Here he is, he's coming out!

232
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,320
Here he is!

233
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,120
Look what a beautiful baby.
A beautiful boy.

234
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,040
Hi, Rino.

235
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,718
This baby's name is Achille.
You hear me?

236
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,758
I'd rather kill myself.
His name's Rino.

237
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,838
Don't bother,
I'll kill you with my bare hands!

238
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,238
His name's Achille! Don't make me mad!

239
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,078
Look at me
and tell me his name's Achille!

240
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,998
- What's all this commotion?
- It's nothing!

241
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,998
His name's Achille!
Don't make me mad!

242
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,398
Please, calm down.

243
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,478
- Lila, look me in the eye!
- Cut the racket!

244
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,318
- Get your hands off me!
- Get out!

245
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,678
Lila, you're getting me kicked out?

246
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,798
Lila, his name's Achille!

247
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,838
His name's Achille!
I said his name has to be Achille!

248
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,120
His name's gonna be Achille!

249
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,280
You want to eat?

250
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,318
<i>She liked feeling him attached to her,</i>

251
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,358
<i>she liked feeling the milk
flowing from her to him,</i>

252
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,158
<i>gradually emptying her breast.</i>

253
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,798
<i>It was the only bond
that gave her well-being</i>

254
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,878
<i>and she confessed in her notebooks</i>

255
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,720
<i>that she dreaded the moment
the baby would stop nursing.</i>

256
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,960
Lila, I'm going out.
I'm going to the store.

257
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,040
Bye, little man.

258
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,600
You hear me?
Take him out for some air.

259
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,560
Miss!

260
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,600
See him?
His name's Gennaro. Rinuccio.

261
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,080
And what's that?

262
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,078
It's entitled "Ulysses".

263
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,678
- Does it talk about the Odyssey?
- No.

264
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,998
It talks about
how prosaic life is today.

265
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,038
Do you like it?

266
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,478
It's difficult,
I don't understand it all.

267
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,320
So why are you reading it?

268
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:22,318
Someone I knew was reading it.
But he didn't like it.

269
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,798
I did.

270
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,438
You shouldn't read books
you can't understand.

271
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,560
They're bad for you.

272
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,760
So many things are bad for you.

273
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,520
You're not happy.

274
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,480
You were destined for big things.

275
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,798
I've done them.
I got married and I had a child.

276
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,080
- Everyone can do that.
- I'm like everyone.

277
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,360
You're wrong.

278
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,958
No, you're wrong.
You always were wrong.

279
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,718
You were a rude child
and you're still rude.

280
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:18,920
Evidently you didn't teach me properly.
I'm sorry, I have to go, it's late.

281
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:29,398
<i>"She's realizing that I'm stupid,"
she thought with a pounding heart.</i>

282
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,318
<i>"She's realizing
that my whole family is stupid,</i>

283
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,238
<i>that my ancestors are stupid,
my descendants will be stupid,</i>

284
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,320
<i>that Gennaro will be stupid."</i>

285
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:44,198
<i>She was obsessed with stimulating
her son's and her nephew's intelligence.</i>

286
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,918
<i>The notebooks began
to fill up with ideas from the books</i>

287
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,998
<i>that she was always buying.</i>

288
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,720
Good boy.

289
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,240
Put some here, too.

290
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,558
Don't worry, we'll do it again.

291
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:09,118
- What are you doing?
- Helping them play.

292
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,760
- My son already knows how to play.
- This way he plays and he learns.

293
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,320
And why are you wasting all this time?

294
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,158
I read that everything we are
is decided now,

295
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,560
in the first few years of life.

296
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,758
Do you want to play too? Yes?

297
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,798
Do you think he's intelligent?

298
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,760
All children are intelligent,
you just have to train them.

299
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,560
Keep training him,
don't give up like you always do.

300
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,600
He has to become
very intelligent, don't you?

301
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,638
Go if you have to, I'll look after Dino.

302
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,958
No, it's late.

303
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,800
I wanted to ask you...
How has Stefano been doing lately?

304
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,440
Fine.

305
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,000
Always the same.

306
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,560
Why do you ask?

307
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,440
Stefano...

308
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:33,520
- What's this mess on the floor?
- I'll tidy up later.

309
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:39,598
- I bet you haven't cooked anything.
- Are you mad?

310
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,598
Did you cook?

311
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,918
I didn't have time,
we'll figure something out.

312
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:48,158
I'm sure my wife's made something.
You can come to my place.

313
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:53,798
No, thanks. I think it's time
for you to go home now.

314
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,998
That's a bit rude.

315
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,958
You and your son come here every day.

316
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,960
You sit here doing nothing,
while the shoe factory goes to hell.

317
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,720
- How dare you?
- Take it easy, Rino.

318
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,438
And don't talk to my brother like that.

319
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,038
And don't raise your voice
in front of the kids.

320
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:19,120
You know what? I didn't sell out
to the Solaras like you.

321
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,038
The truth is
you don't want to do a fucking thing.

322
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,918
You Cerullos are all the same.
You're unreliable.

323
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,398
Wash your mouth
before you say "Cerullo".

324
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,838
Calm down, the kids are here.

325
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:42,278
Do as I say, go home right now
or I'll kick your ass!

326
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,718
- Stefano, please.
- Who the fuck do you think you are?

327
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,000
You're nobody, you're a piece of shit.

328
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:56,440
Your father knew how to be a criminal,
you don't even know how to do that.

329
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,878
Come with me! Asshole!
What did you say?

330
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,880
You piece of shit!

331
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:15,918
Come on, you piece of shit!
Get outta my house!

332
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,678
Fucking parasite!
You and your whole family!

333
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,918
Get out!

334
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,198
Where's the other one?
Where is he?

335
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,358
- What are you doing?
- Come here!

336
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,958
Leave the boy alone! He's a baby!

337
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,720
- Come here!
- Leave him alone!

338
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,800
What's the matter with you?

339
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,480
I want Mamma!

340
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,760
I can't take it anymore.

341
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,600
I'm fucking sick of this,
I can't take it anymore.

342
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,918
Nothing happened, sweetheart.

343
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,358
<i>In those months,
after a period of mutual tolerance,</i>

344
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,680
<i>their relationship deteriorated again.</i>

345
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,838
- Hi.
- Hi, Lila.

346
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:47,318
- Wait for me, we'll eat together.
- No, I just came to say hi.

347
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,520
I was in town looking
for some books, I was just going.

348
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,758
<i>The time she had spent
in that place with Nino,</i>

349
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,438
<i>in the shade of
the shop's lowered shutter,</i>

350
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,678
<i>seemed a time she'd imagined.</i>

351
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,998
<i>She discovered
she felt no nostalgia for it</i>

352
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,440
<i>and that what had been important
no longer was.</i>

353
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,238
Lila, what a lovely surprise.

354
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,640
- Hi, Michele.
- What are you doing here?

355
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,998
- I had an errand nearby, I'm going.
- Where are you going?

356
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,758
- I'm going home.
- On public transport?

357
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,798
- How else?
- I'll drive you.

358
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,518
You've just arrived.

359
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,718
No problem, Alfonsino's here,
he's the best of the lot.

360
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,800
- Much better than your brother.
- Wouldn't take much.

361
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:45,120
Come on, I'll drive you home.
Let's go.

362
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,798
- What did you have to say to Alfonso?
- Why?

363
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,960
I can't act jealous about Alfonso.

364
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,398
And not only because
he's Stefano's brother,

365
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,678
but because he doesn't like women.

366
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,640
Why would you act jealous with me?

367
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,200
Leave your husband now, today.
I'll take you and the baby.

368
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,438
I bought a house in Vomero
with you in mind.

369
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,560
If you like I'll show it to you now.

370
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,800
You could do what you want there:
read, write, be with Rinuccio.

371
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,560
I just want to look at you,
listen to you.

372
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,480
- Just say yes or no.
- No, the answer is no.

373
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,758
I didn't want your brother
and I don't want you either.

374
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,600
You think you can take everything
and respect nothing.

375
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,160
Give him his pacifier,
don't let him cry.

376
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,400
It's good for him to cry a little.

377
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,358
Think about it, maybe tomorrow
you'll come begging.

378
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,560
I really don't think so.

379
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,600
You really don't think so? Are you sure?

380
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,998
Even if I told you you're the only one
who doesn't know?

381
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,480
Everyone knows: your father,
your mother, your scumbag brother.

382
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,918
They haven't told you to keep the peace.

383
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,918
What don't I know?

384
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,638
Stefano's gotten together
with your friend.

385
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,640
Who?

386
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,320
Ada.

387
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,398
She's been his lover
since you were on Ischia,

388
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,838
they saw each other
every night at your place.

389
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,838
They broke up, got back together...

390
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,438
Now your husband's rented her
an apartment in town

391
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,280
and they meet there.

392
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,000
Do you believe me?

393
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,718
- Yes.
- And so?

394
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,198
And so, you disgust me.

395
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,760
Stefano disgusts me, you all disgust me.

396
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,798
<i>Lila wasn't troubled by the fact
her husband had a lover,</i>

397
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,798
<i>and that the lover was Ada,</i>

398
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,558
<i>but rather by the absurdity
of his words and actions</i>

399
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,920
<i>when he came to pick her up from Ischia.</i>

400
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,878
<i>She realized she was afraid.</i>

401
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,758
<i>If her husband had taken another woman
and wanted her every day,</i>

402
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,758
<i>he could go mad, he could kick her out.</i>

403
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,758
<i>She thought she'd lose the house</i>

404
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:05,200
<i>and the means that enabled her
to raise the child in the best way.</i>

405
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,880
How come you set the table here?

406
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,320
- No reason, just for a change.
- Hi, little guy.

407
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,880
What are we doing this summer?

408
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,600
Take the bus
and go to the beach nearby.

409
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,880
Can't we rent a house?

410
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,400
It's not good for the baby
to go back and forth to the beach.

411
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,598
Those shitbags, the Solaras,
won't share their earnings.

412
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,480
They act like the shoes are all theirs.

413
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,678
They take your designs, get them
made by artisans on the outskirts

414
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,198
and put the Solara brand on them.

415
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,598
Get it?

416
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,278
I'm losing all the money
I invested in your father's business.

417
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,960
The new grocery store isn't earning.

418
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:24,238
- Do you get it now?
- Yes.

419
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,320
So try not to break my balls.

420
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,118
What did you say
to that asshole Michele Solara?

421
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,278
- Nothing.
- That's not possible.

422
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,398
In every discussion he brings you up
and badgers me.

423
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,800
Talk to him and find out what he wants,
or I'll smash both your faces in.

424
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,040
If he wants to screw me, what do I do?

425
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,680
Let him screw me?

426
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,320
No two ways about it, Lila.

427
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,680
You read, you study,
but you're vulgar.

428
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,320
I can't stand women like you.

429
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,920
You disgust me.

430
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,080
Where are you going?

431
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,278
<i>From that moment on
he came home later and later</i>

432
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,318
<i>and on Sundays, instead
of sleeping until noon as usual,</i>

433
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,360
<i>he went out early
and disappeared for the whole day.</i>

434
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,918
<i>Then one evening,
Lila decided to confront him,</i>

435
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,640
<i>she put Gennaro to bed
and waited for Stefano to come home.</i>

436
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,400
- What are you doing?
- Sit down for a minute.

437
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,680
- What is it?
- I know all about Ada.

438
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,760
I even know how long
you've been together and I don't care.

439
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,280
What you did to me, I did to you.

440
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,600
What do you mean?

441
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,160
Gennarino isn't your son.

442
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,838
Not that again...

443
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,880
You talk a lot of bullshit.

444
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,800
Ada's only a shop girl
in the grocery store.

445
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,800
People in the neighborhood
talk a lotta crap, don't believe it.

446
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,600
But you mustn't ever say that
about my son again.

447
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,840
Or I'll kill you with my bare hands
and I'll do it for real.

448
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:48,598
Gennarino's identical to me,
all the neighborhood says so.

449
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,438
And you know why he's my son?

450
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,998
You know why he came along
although you didn't want him?

451
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,160
Because he's the fruit of my love.
Because I love you.

452
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,080
I'll always love you,
I promised at the altar.

453
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:10,400
And nothing can separate us.
Even if you act like a bitch.

454
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,880
Lila, I love you...

455
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,160
- Come here.
- Don't you dare!

456
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,400
But why?

457
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,400
Why?

458
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,200
Are you thinking of someone else?

459
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,680
I love you, Lila.

460
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,318
- Let go of me.
- Lila, I need you.

461
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,758
- Let go of me, Stefano.
- Come here, I love you.

462
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,678
- Please!
- What are you doing? No!

463
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,238
- Let's go in there.
- Let go of me.

464
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,758
- Gennaro's sleeping...
- It doesn't matter.

465
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:13,280
- Please, I need you. Come.
- No.

466
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,920
I need you.

467
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,560
I love you.

468
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,760
I love you.

469
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:52,758
<i>At this point the notebooks broke off.</i>

470
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:58,118
<i>She'd given them to me when I had
lunch with her in the neighborhood.</i>

471
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:02,798
<i>I feared she'd instantly find a way
to reinstate the old hierarchy,</i>

472
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,318
<i>make me lose confidence
in my choices,</i>

473
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:11,278
<i>but above all I feared she'd point out
Nino's features in little Gennaro,</i>

474
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:16,520
<i>to remind me that the toy
that should have been mine was hers.</i>

475
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,840
You don't want anymore?
You want to go and draw?

476
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,880
- How are things with Stefano?
- Good.

477
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,480
Sorry.

478
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,160
Lila...

479
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,480
He ruined my books.

480
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,838
He's gotten in the habit
of going through my things.

481
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:10,320
He doesn't want me
to have even a thought of my own.

482
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:17,480
If he discovers I've hidden even
something insignificant, he beats me.

483
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:47,758
Here's everything that happened to me,

484
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,238
all the thoughts that have gone
through my head for years.

485
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,438
Things about you and me, too.

486
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,040
Take them away, I'm afraid that Stefano
will find them and read them.

487
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:06,160
They're not things for him,
nor for you either.

488
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,360
Swear you'll never read them.

489
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:15,438
- I swear.
- Lenù...

490
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,398
I don't remember anything
about Nino, about Ischia,

491
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,998
about the store in Piazza dei Martiri,

492
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,200
I'm not interested in what
happened to him, where he went.

493
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,760
And yet it seemed to me
that I loved him more than myself.

494
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,398
There's one good thing
about infatuations:

495
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,758
after a while they pass.

496
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,718
- You have to do me another favor.
- What?

497
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,478
Gennarino and I have to leave,

498
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,358
before Stefano kills us
without realizing it.

499
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,518
You're frightening me.

500
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:58,838
Go to Enzo, tell him
I tried but I couldn't make it.

501
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,238
- I don't understand.
- Never mind.

502
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,480
You're in Pisa, you have a lot
of things to think about.

503
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,160
Tell him that.

504
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,600
- All right.
- Mom!

505
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,958
- Go and play with him.
- Me?

506
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,320
Yes.

507
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,080
Rino, play with Auntie Lenù.

508
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:15,198
It's gone down, thank goodness.
I can leave with an easy mind.

509
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,118
- Let me come with you.
- No, you better stay here.

510
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:23,838
- How will you get to the train station?
- The same way I came.

511
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,598
I want to go with you.

512
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,558
I know the way,
you mustn't over-exert yourself,

513
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,438
or you'll have a relapse.

514
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,838
The things I brought you
are in the cupboard,

515
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,280
so you can eat healthier.

516
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:42,558
How can you cook
with the few pots there are?

517
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,000
Give me a hug.

518
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,960
Take care of yourself now.

519
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,200
- I want to come.
- Don't come out, you'll catch a chill.

520
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,040
Bye, Lenù.

521
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,480
I'm sorry.

522
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:10,038
- Goodbye, girl.
- Thank you.

523
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,400
Go to bed, it's still early.

524
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,518
<i>Lila's notebooks unsettled me.</i>

525
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,198
<i>Every word diminished me,
every sentence,</i>

526
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,118
<i>even those written
when she was still a child,</i>

527
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:15,598
<i>seemed to empty out mine,
not from back then, but from now.</i>

528
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:20,118
<i>I suddenly realized
my whole life was an "almost".</i>

529
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,358
<i>I'd made it... almost.</i>

530
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,918
<i>I'd torn myself away from Naples,
from the neighborhood... almost.</i>

531
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:33,318
<i>I had new friends who came
from cultured backgrounds... almost.</i>

532
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:36,718
<i>From exam to exam,
I had become well received</i>

533
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,400
<i>by the pensive professors
who questioned me... almost.</i>

534
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:47,598
<i>Behind all these "almosts"
I seemed to see how things stood.</i>

535
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:51,318
<i>I was still scared
and I felt that somewhere</i>

536
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:54,600
<i>Lila, as always, was without "almosts".</i>

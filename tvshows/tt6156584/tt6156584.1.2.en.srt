1
00:00:05,507 --> 00:00:09,219
<i>You'd think with all we've lost,
that defeat would break us.</i>

2
00:00:09,302 --> 00:00:12,972
<i>But the only reason we're here
is we refused to die in the first place.</i>

3
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:17,268
<i>We're as persistent as the cold,</i>

4
00:00:17,352 --> 00:00:19,479
<i>forever trapped beneath the ice.</i>

5
00:00:20,647 --> 00:00:24,359
<i>We keep our eyes on the floor,
dig our nails in,</i>

6
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:26,694
<i>and prepare to brace.</i>

7
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:32,325
Do you think I wanna be here? Eh?

8
00:00:33,493 --> 00:00:37,247
That Mr. Wilford wants me to be doing this?

9
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:43,711
Snowpiercer is all that's left of the world.

10
00:00:43,795 --> 00:00:45,672
- Mommy!
- Please, no, no.

11
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:50,885
Each of us has a personal responsibility
to the Engine Eternal.

12
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,514
You Tailies barely have to do anything.
Yeah?

13
00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:57,725
Just sit around and don't rebel.

14
00:00:59,227 --> 00:01:01,312
- This is your fault.
- Mom.

15
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:06,526
- Let's get it over with.
- Please don't. Please.

16
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,321
Do it to me instead.

17
00:01:12,407 --> 00:01:14,242
Where's the logic in that?

18
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:15,827
She's just a little girl.

19
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,081
Yeah, a little girl
who helped to kill six men.

20
00:01:21,124 --> 00:01:24,460
I'm her mother. It's my fault.

21
00:01:25,545 --> 00:01:27,839
I let her help the rebellion.

22
00:01:34,262 --> 00:01:35,888
Finally.

23
00:01:35,972 --> 00:01:40,768
Someone with the moral fortitude
to take responsibility for their actions.

24
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:43,186
All right.

25
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:48,943
Oh, baby. Oh, come here, baby.
It's okay. It's okay.

26
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:52,155
It's okay. It's okay, honey.

27
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:54,782
You're so brave.

28
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:59,704
It's gonna be okay. Look at me. Look at me.

29
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:04,334
Go to your brother.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

31
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,016
Be strong, Winnipeg.

32
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:23,102
I love you.

33
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:40,536
Unticketed passengers,

34
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,373
Mr. Wilford has found you guilty
of insurrection, murder

35
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:45,500
and disturbing the order of the train.

36
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:49,796
As stowaways, you have no right to trial
or the established appeals process.

37
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,881
Layton, keep your promise. You hear me?

38
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:54,926
It is only by the largess and mercy
of our Engine Eternal

39
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,969
that you have been allowed to live thus far.

40
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:05,687
It's gonna be okay.

41
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:09,190
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

42
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:12,318
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

43
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,168
So by the authority of Wilford Industries,

44
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:33,381
you are hereby sentenced
to indefinite suspension in the Drawers.

45
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:36,384
May God have mercy on your spark.

46
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,521
<i>They can take our limbs,</i>

47
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:50,898
<i>our children,</i>

48
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:53,693
<i>our leaders.</i>

49
00:03:54,694 --> 00:03:57,071
<i>They keep trying to take our dignity,</i>

50
00:03:57,155 --> 00:04:00,992
<i>but any survivor will tell you
they check their dignity at death's door.</i>

51
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:05,788
<i>The more they steal from us,
the more human we become.</i>

52
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:10,042
<i>Humanity will fill our bellies one day</i>

53
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,673
<i>when we eat the rich of Snowpiercer,</i>

54
00:04:15,757 --> 00:04:18,468
<i>One thousand and one cars long.</i>

55
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:44,702
Easy, girl.

56
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:13,314
We're facing
Class Four tracks and...

57
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:16,251
- That's why I reconfigured the plow.
- I can't see conditions here.

58
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:17,461
Good morning, engineers.

59
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:20,696
Good morning.
Our speed keeps triggering avalanches.

60
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,907
Second one in an hour.

61
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,535
This stretch gets rougher every revolution.

62
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:29,247
With a storm like this, Mel,
it doesn't matter how many satellites I hack.

63
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,290
We're basically running blind right now.

64
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,753
Keep the speed up.
I'm gonna be busy downtrain today.

65
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:37,964
It's gonna get hairy.
How's your murder in Third?

66
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:39,799
It's two murders in Third,

67
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:42,260
an uprising in the Tail,

68
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:45,638
and drama in First where they're acting
like there's a mob at their door.

69
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,598
Guys, back to the Engine, please.

70
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:49,267
Do not highball this terrain.

71
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,353
I recommend we throttle back 12 percent.

72
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:57,149
Javi, I can't announce blackouts. Not today.

73
00:05:57,233 --> 00:06:01,279
Well, you can slow for safety,
or you can have electricity.

74
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,030
Maintain speed.

75
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,368
She'll hold the track.

76
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:13,416
How long do you think she can keep this up?

77
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:18,462
Well, Javi, we're going on seven years
and counting.

78
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:21,799
<i>Attention all passengers.</i>

79
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:25,595
<i>Wilford Industries wishes you good morning.</i>

80
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:28,198
<i>- The temperature outside is minus 100 degrees.</i>
- Get up.

81
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,308
How you feeling this morning, Brakeman?

82
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,895
Sit down.

83
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:38,566
Don't get used to it.

84
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:39,567
Yeah.

85
00:06:39,568 --> 00:06:43,446
She might be experiencing some PTSD
symptoms because I saved her life.

86
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:46,741
You were in it to save your buddies.
I don't owe you a thing.

87
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:50,077
You two are gonna have a great day.

88
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:53,205
- Sanitation!
- All right, back it up!

89
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:54,569
You know the drill.

90
00:06:54,624 --> 00:06:55,958
Sanitation detail.

91
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:59,629
Uptrain, you'll keep your eyes down.

92
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:02,089
You will not interact
with ticketed passengers.

93
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:09,388
- Watch it, Tailie.
- You can just ask nicely.

94
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:12,892
Your people killed their friends.
I don't think you realize how unpopular you are.

95
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:16,604
Yeah, well, they killed 14 of mine.

96
00:07:24,737 --> 00:07:26,906
Layton, come on.

97
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:29,742
It was a good, clean arm.

98
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:31,911
It shattered very nicely.

99
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:36,290
But, no, that's not enough for the Folgers.
They're with Sharma.

100
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:39,377
She's worked up a nice head of steam.
I'll handle her.

101
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,836
Oh, wait a minute.

102
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:44,423
- Oopsie.
- There you go.

103
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:49,345
You're the First Class Committee Chair.
Table it or I will.

104
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:51,931
How are everyone's train legs?

105
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,599
Did we miss our Gravol this morning?

106
00:07:53,683 --> 00:07:57,645
Actually, Melanie, we don't think that Gravol
is the best prescription

107
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:59,772
for a rebellion in the Tail.

108
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:03,401
I think "rebellion" is overstating it.
Commander Grey had it contained in minutes.

109
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:06,112
Six dead. Security forces
don't grow on trees, Melanie.

110
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:08,840
- And we have a second concern.
- The murder in Third.

111
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,951
You keep quiet because you called up
a Tailie to assist the investigation.

112
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:16,706
Mr. Wilford picked the person for the job.
He's a former homicide detective.

113
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:20,209
- There's a policeman in the Tail?
- There's a bit of everything back there.

114
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:21,460
Don't worry, Mrs. Folger.

115
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:25,089
Upgrading this man in the middle
of a rebellion, it sends the wrong message.

116
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:29,260
If Mr. Wilford needs help,
I was a lawyer for 25 years.

117
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:33,264
I'd be happy to share insights
if you share details of the investigation.

118
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:36,642
Well, as a lawyer, you understand
that information is privileged.

119
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:40,563
And I didn't know that Finklestein,
Branxom, and Folger did murders, Mom.

120
00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:43,607
Go ahead and laugh.

121
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:47,820
My family may not think
I'm capable, Melanie,

122
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:51,449
but the Freeze taught us all
we have the capacity to kill.

123
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,829
Which is why everyone is a suspect.
Even you.

124
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:00,416
Do you want more coffee, Lilah?

125
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,209
Well, enjoy your breakfast.

126
00:09:02,293 --> 00:09:06,881
And it's a good day to stay seated
and ready to brace.

127
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:09,425
- Thank you.
- Can I get you anything else?

128
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:13,262
How's your breakfast? Wonderful. Thank you.

129
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,649
Tailie tossed coming through.

130
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,861
Buddy, keep moving.

131
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:37,870
You ready to detect, detective?

132
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,460
- Tunnelman Jakes Carter.
- Come on.

133
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:45,961
He's the guy who found the body.

134
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:48,464
- I'm working a double. This is my break.
- I'll join you.

135
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,674
Hey, small for me. He's good.

136
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:56,472
I know you. You're that Tailie detective.
Look, I already told what happened once.

137
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:58,307
I'm the Train Detective,

138
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,393
and Mr. Wilford asked me
to come hear it from you directly.

139
00:10:01,477 --> 00:10:04,563
Do you have a problem with that?

140
00:10:06,065 --> 00:10:09,401
No. No problem.

141
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:14,657
I was doing routine maintenance
under Ag-Sec.

142
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,035
It was just another day,
round and round we go, right?

143
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:23,332
I pop a floor panel, and there he is.
No arms, no legs and no dick.

144
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:27,253
- Who has access to the sub-train?
- Pfft. Hundreds of people go through every day.

145
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:30,214
Workers, passengers, all classes.

146
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,424
What are the checkpoints
like between classes?

147
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:33,926
Don't answer that.

148
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:38,139
I am trying to assess
how far you can move a body.

149
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:44,436
All right.

150
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:47,231
That's it?

151
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:50,192
No, one more thing.
What's that you're eating?

152
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:51,527
Mm.

153
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,863
This is the best beef noodles
on the train right here.

154
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:58,784
Hey, if we need you again,
don't be an asshole.

155
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:07,168
Okay, stay on point.

156
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:09,128
We got two hours until the autopsy,

157
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:12,006
and Nikki Genet is still unconscious,
restricted access.

158
00:11:13,174 --> 00:11:15,551
Well, when you're done with your beef,

159
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:18,053
we'll take a trip to the Night Car
where she used to work.

160
00:11:18,137 --> 00:11:20,764
Scene of the first crime. It's good.

161
00:11:27,897 --> 00:11:30,691
Is the issue with the suspension formula
or the duration?

162
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,986
That's a complicated interplay.
I've taken very good care of her.

163
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,363
I'm trying to figure out
if she's gonna come out of it.

164
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:38,324
Slowly. I hope.

165
00:11:39,325 --> 00:11:42,203
You should recommend
Mr. Wilford put the entire program on hold.

166
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:43,537
No.

167
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:50,211
Tell Mr. Wilford I'll get to the bottom of it.
Please.

168
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:56,091
Then we better go look at your data.

169
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:57,927
Night-Night Car.

170
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,804
Night-Night Car.

171
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:04,183
Night-Night Car.

172
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:28,415
Welcome to the Night Car.

It's her place.

194
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:22,780
I found Nikki in the room with Edward,
her regular.

195
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:27,868
She had no idea what was happening.
Drugged, I'm sure, by the real killer.

196
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:32,081
But Mr. Wilford needed a quick resolution.
A body in a Drawer.

197
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:33,707
This time will be different.

198
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:38,629
Just for context, what was Melanie Cavill's
role back then?

199
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:42,925
That's a good question.
It's her lips to God's ear, isn't it?

200
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:45,969
On the house.

201
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:50,182
Old-world spirits.

202
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:54,186
A little something special for your service.

203
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:56,397
What service is that?

204
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,191
You could reverse a Wilford injustice.

205
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:02,903
That hope is in short supply in Third.

206
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:31,974
I've been wondering for a long time

207
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:35,352
what exactly it is you do up here
in the Night Car.

208
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:37,396
We offer epiphanies, darling.

209
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:42,443
Let him go see for himself.

210
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:44,278
I can't let him out of my sight.

211
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:49,825
If you want this to be different than Nikki,
he needs to understand what she did.

212
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:59,168
You can have 20 minutes.
I'll be waiting right here.

213
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:06,967
What is it about this case you couldn't
tell me in front of a Brakeman?

214
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:11,430
Patience, Mr. Layton.
You wanted to know what we do here.

215
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:13,140
You gonna give me the good stuff?

216
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:16,685
The Night Car's never actually
been a brothel, Andre.

217
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,313
When the world ended,
most people needed something else.

218
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:23,442
To grieve, to connect
with everything we've lost.

219
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:26,612
I've developed the Night Car Experience
so we could heal,

220
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:29,156
individually and collectively.

221
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,741
You a therapist?

222
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,953
Relax, Andre. Clear your mind.

223
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:37,873
Remember how we used to meditate
in the Tail?

224
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:42,085
- Yeah, I gave that up when you left.
- You're in good hands.

225
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,838
I'm sure we'll meet again soon.

226
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,597
Close your eyes.

227
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:15,327
Do you remember the water, Andre?

228
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:20,958
I remember.

229
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:24,670
Falling.

230
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:27,839
Free-flowing.

231
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:32,803
An element still awake.

232
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:36,682
Hear the wind.

233
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,562
Earth is still alive.

234
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:44,773
The birds.

235
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:47,776
The leaves.

236
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,197
Remember the trees.

237
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,409
The grass,

238
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:57,953
<i>the sun.</i>

239
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,124
I can feel it.

240
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,628
<i>Where are you?</i>

241
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:16,138
I'm home.

242
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:20,851
I see you.

243
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:24,730
<i>Excuse me, ma'am?</i>

244
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:29,192
- Yes?
- Yeah, I'm gonna need to see some identification.

245
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:31,235
Oh, I...

246
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:33,614
Oh, whoa.

247
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:35,240
No reason to be nervous.

248
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:39,453
- Don't let the badge intimidate you.
- Oh, don't worry.

249
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:40,954
It doesn't.

250
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:42,581
Mm.

251
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,253
<i>I missed you.</i>

252
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:49,880
Where are you?

253
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,590
I'm hungry.

254
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:54,593
- I'm starving.
- I got you.

255
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:55,676
Ooh.

256
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,012
- Doughnuts!
- Mm-hm.

257
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,056
Old-school. Weber's.

258
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,849
Your favorite.

259
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:03,226
- I love you, Andre.
- Mm.

260
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:06,396
What?

261
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:09,983
Zarah Ferami...

262
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:15,906
...you wanna do this thing?

263
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,408
Get married? You know, make it real?

264
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:21,078
- We are real.
- I know, yes, but realer.

265
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,161
Say the words...

266
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:28,085
Hold, cherish, sickness,
health, all that shit.

267
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:29,961
I'm not worried about us, Andre.

268
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:35,801
- I'm worried about the world.
- I got you, Zarah.

269
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:40,681
- In good times and bad.
- I know, Andre.

270
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:43,266
I do.

271
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:56,822
I just wanted to hold you forever.

272
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:49,499
To be clear,
this is not how it usually goes.

273
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,718
What'd you want to tell me?

274
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:07,058
Wilford's people aren't telling you
everything about Sean.

275
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:11,104
I think he was a snitch, because he was lucky.
Like, he got perks.

276
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:13,440
- What kind of perks?
- We won the Baby Lottery.

277
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:17,110
That kind of luck usually means
you have a friend uptrain.

278
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:20,739
I was gonna do it.
I was gonna have a baby with Sean.

279
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:26,036
- Did you love him?
- It's Snowpiercer, Andre.

280
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:31,625
Look, I'm not gonna let them pin
this murder on you, Zarah,

281
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:35,837
but while I'm up here,
I have a responsibility to the Tail.

282
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:41,051
Would it be so terrible
if you stayed up here?

283
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:43,637
With me?

284
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:48,517
Time's up.

285
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,560
Uh-huh.

286
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:55,023
Not what my Night Car trip looked like.

287
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:58,068
Unfortunately.

288
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,571
You were supposed
to be getting context on Nikki.

289
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:05,116
That's called taking a mile.

290
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,161
Sometimes detective work
requires a personal touch.

291
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,874
Just to be clear,
I've never done an autopsy before.

292
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:18,004
But I'm ex-Navy Medical Corps,
so I do know how to look for trauma and...

293
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:20,841
Oh, and diagnose PTSD.

294
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:23,468
I guess we've all got that now, don't we?

295
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:29,224
I formed out of Afghanistan for a one-year gig
on Wilford's Dreamliner as a medic.

296
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:31,977
Who knew the world would freeze
and the job would last forever?

297
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,688
This lividity here, that's pooled blood.

298
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:38,066
Means he lay facedown for a while postmortem.
They moved him later.

299
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:41,987
What else did you see yesterday
and not share?

300
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,238
You tell me.

301
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:47,993
- Okay. Multiple ligature marks.
- Yeah.

302
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:52,205
Choked in and out. They wanted
to drag out chopping his dick off.

303
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:54,499
Stumps look sawn off.

304
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:57,002
Looks like this way, down.

305
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:58,336
Hacksaw maybe?

306
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,006
So the limbs were removed
after he was faceup.

307
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:04,467
Oh, looks like with a different tool.

308
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:06,468
Machete?

309
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:08,512
Cleaver?

310
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:14,352
You guys really don't go there?

311
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:16,688
What?

312
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:19,649
Okay, who has the tools for this?

313
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,782
Those noodles you had earlier,
there were meat scraps in them, from where?

314
00:23:27,866 --> 00:23:29,200
The butchers.

315
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:35,373
- You're not saying this is cannibalism.
- No.

316
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:39,294
We don't do that up here. We all know
the rumors about the Tail, but we...

317
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:44,132
Oh, those aren't rumors.
First couple of years, there were Kill Cults.

318
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:52,015
One gang in particular,
they would kill anyone, eat anyone.

319
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:54,893
Had no choice.

320
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:57,270
The rest of us, we ambushed their leader,

321
00:23:57,354 --> 00:24:00,065
each of us ate a piece of his heart

322
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:03,485
so that no one could say they were innocent.

323
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:09,866
Anyway, your lunch was good?

324
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:32,681
Hold on.

325
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:42,906
- What do you want?
- Open up, please.

326
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:45,652
- We need to look in your freezer.
- It's a restricted area.

327
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:49,614
- Brakeman's business.
- I don't give a shit. It's a restricted area.

328
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:51,700
If you want in, get the Notary.

329
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:54,327
Nice knife.

330
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:57,038
Bet you could cut my leg off with that.

331
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,833
We're butchering today.

332
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:02,711
- Come back with the Notary.
- Come on.

333
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,798
I assume it's due
to how long she was under.

334
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:11,261
I agree, but pinpointing the complex
matrix of titration, duration, isolation.

335
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,221
- It's gonna take...
- More research, yeah.

336
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:16,099
Or subjects. It's the catch-22...

337
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:19,019
This is bad.

338
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:22,480
She may have suffered
permanent neurological damage.

339
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:25,650
We can't justify...

340
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:34,469
I've got a seismic alarm. How bad is it?

341
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:40,767
<i>Mierda. Mierda.</i>
The whole slope is coming down.

342
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:44,979
Oh, shit.

343
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:48,233
It's a Class Three.
We're not gonna get through the debris.

344
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:50,151
Hold on.

345
00:26:50,235 --> 00:26:51,653
Brace!

346
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:53,154
<i>Brace for impact.</i>

347
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:18,388
We got a breach. Ag-Sec, Cattle Car.

348
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:21,266
We have a breach. Ag-Sec, Cattle Car.

349
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:23,935
Javi, take over.

350
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:26,896
Got it.

351
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:38,783
You okay?

352
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:48,626
Keep moving back.

353
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,485
Let us back in there.
We gotta search the freezer.

354
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:16,196
No, it's an emergency. Out of the way.

355
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,739
Out of the way!

356
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:20,658
- Jackboot!
- Breachman.

357
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:22,076
All right, two minutes.

358
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:26,831
Close the door.

359
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:50,104
Check this out.

360
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:54,609
Oh, I got it.

361
00:29:12,044 --> 00:29:15,964
- Hey, hey! Relax.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

362
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,883
Yeah.

363
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:24,555
Oh, God.

364
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:26,349
Here's the beef.

365
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:09,267
How about this one, huh?

366
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:12,395
Seven years she work hospitality
for Mr. Wilford,

367
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,189
and now she comes downtrain
to be engineer.

368
00:30:15,273 --> 00:30:18,443
Wilford asked her
to check it personally.

369
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:19,569
Okay.

370
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:24,699
Breachman Bojan Boscovic, at his service.

371
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:28,786
It's an extinction event.

372
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,623
Sorry.

373
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:34,584
Window job first.

374
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:37,128
We need to know if it's structurally sound.

375
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:39,672
I've been given the okay
to reduce speed 10 percent.

376
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:43,343
No, no. That is too fast for mountain work.
You give me 25.

377
00:30:43,426 --> 00:30:47,472
Battery banks. We don't have
the terrain ahead to make it up.

378
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:49,098
I can probably get you 12.

379
00:30:49,182 --> 00:30:50,182
Mm.

380
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,102
No Jacuzzis in First.

381
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,148
Okay.

382
00:30:57,231 --> 00:31:00,401
So we're on rolling blackouts,
starting with the Tail.

383
00:31:00,485 --> 00:31:05,740
What's 20 plus five
for our little ones in the group?

384
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:07,784
Twenty-five?

385
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:09,744
You got to give everyone a chance.

386
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:11,788
You got 26.

387
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:13,956
Yep.

388
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,084
- Freaking hell.
- Come on.

389
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:22,840
Hurry up.
They'll send more Jacks for this blackout.

390
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:27,261
Someone's coming.

391
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:29,097
Hang on, hang on.

392
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,225
The medicine.

393
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:34,352
But no painkillers, just Kronole.

394
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:36,396
I'm not giving that crap to my mom.

395
00:31:37,522 --> 00:31:40,483
Okay, but it kills the pain.

396
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:43,820
Of everything.

397
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:05,716
Patterson, how?

398
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:26,028
Here you go. Open up. Open up.

399
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,780
Good girl.

400
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:31,409
Okay, Suzanne. There.

401
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:34,162
Let's stop now.

402
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:43,963
We can't ration any more power to Ag-Sec
unless we start canceling crops.

403
00:32:44,046 --> 00:32:45,256
We're not breaking rotation.

404
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:49,427
Water won't flow for a couple days at least,
not until the crack in the hull is sealed.

405
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:53,973
Then we only have what's in the reservoir
for Third, Ag-Sec and Tail.

406
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:05,443
We ration the people, not the crops.

407
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:08,613
Third and Second will get 15 minutes
of running water a day,

408
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:11,532
and the Tail will have to survive
on what they've hoarded.

409
00:33:11,616 --> 00:33:17,121
Is this what the start of a resource crash
feels like? Starving the train from the Tail up?

410
00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:21,667
It's not just the beef. It's manure for fertilizer.
It's bovine cultures. We use their methane.

411
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:24,253
I know. It's bad.

412
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:27,381
But how bad stays between us.

413
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:30,843
In the meantime, we press ahead
with selecting the new apprentices,

414
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:34,013
and we bolster faith in Wilford
to get them through.

415
00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:09,674
Despite your violence yesterday,

416
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:13,719
and the grave hand of fate
hanging over our heads this very second,

417
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:18,558
Mr. Wilford believes
that children deserve an education

418
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:22,103
in skilled or unskilled labor,

419
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:26,899
and so we are proceeding
with apprenticeship selection.

420
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:32,780
The names are as follows.

421
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:35,783
Mikala Mwanza.

422
00:34:39,537 --> 00:34:42,081
Mia Kaisheck.

423
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:49,630
And the boy they call Miles and Miles.

424
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,059
Should your families choose
to accept his invitation,

425
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:08,190
you have one hour to get ready
for your new lives uptrain.

426
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:20,536
Two legs and one arm.

427
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:24,874
- Left arm.
- Can you hang up?

428
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:25,957
What?

429
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:30,838
- No, all the butchers are dead, Roche.
- Hey, look, the butcher didn't kill Sean.

430
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,923
- Think it through for a second.
- Okay.

431
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:35,760
If you're gonna retail him for meat,
then why the torture?

432
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:37,261
Okay. Uh...

433
00:35:38,471 --> 00:35:41,140
Whoever did it got off on castrating him.

434
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:45,186
But the arms and legs were the exact opposite.
No emotion at all.

435
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:46,520
So the butchers come second.

436
00:35:46,604 --> 00:35:49,148
He puts arms and legs
in my fricking noodles.

437
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:52,109
Tailie.

438
00:35:54,487 --> 00:35:57,281
- Easy.
- Back off, douche.

439
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,202
Tail-sucker.

440
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:06,123
- There is no use getting us both shit-kicked.
- What do you care?

441
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:08,417
Blame the butchers
and claim your Third Class cabin.

442
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:11,420
First off, I don't want Third Class.
I wanna go back to the Tail.

443
00:36:11,504 --> 00:36:13,130
And second...

444
00:36:15,883 --> 00:36:18,010
Guess I'm still a cop, after all.

445
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,521
I was assigned to the first murder too.

446
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:34,068
They had Nikki guilty out of the gate.
Fast tribunal.

447
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:39,156
Took all of three hours.
Nothing I could've done for her.

448
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:45,579
You still care about getting the right guy?

449
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:53,546
I finally got into the freezer
and recovered your limbs.

450
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:55,131
- Pretty good day.
- Thanks.

451
00:36:57,383 --> 00:37:01,345
She's good at this part, by the way,
patting down the boys on the corner.

452
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:04,515
Good night, detective.

453
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:36,774
Keep it moving.
Eyes down until you're back in the Tail.

454
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,844
Eyes down.

455
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:08,597
Keep moving.

456
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:20,234
Come and get me, asshole!

457
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:22,152
Down! Get down!

458
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:27,032
- Get down!
- Hey, get off! Get off! Hey!

459
00:39:31,161 --> 00:39:32,413
Layton!

460
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:35,916
Get on the ground!

461
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:54,393
Do you remember your mom, Miles?

462
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:57,938
I...

463
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:00,983
I remember...

464
00:40:03,694 --> 00:40:05,529
She smelled good.

465
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:08,741
That's all?

466
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:12,953
I only remember the train.
You're my Tail mom.

467
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,792
Miles and Miles.

468
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:20,961
Miles and Miles and Miles,

469
00:40:21,045 --> 00:40:23,505
Miles, Miles, Miles.

470
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,806
You were so little when we started.

471
00:40:34,183 --> 00:40:35,809
I'm not anymore.

472
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:45,194
Well, then, you better decide
for yourself, don't you?

473
00:40:49,365 --> 00:40:51,742
Layton says we need our people uptrain.

474
00:40:55,162 --> 00:40:56,830
He's right.

475
00:40:56,914 --> 00:40:59,083
We need every department,
friends high and low.

476
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:03,337
You see? You are a good listener.

477
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:08,299
Miles...

478
00:41:10,928 --> 00:41:15,265
I swear to you,
I will not stop fighting from the back.

479
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:19,395
But you're going uptrain.

480
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,566
- And that means we might never see...
- Yes, we will.

481
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:27,236
After the revolution, like Layton said.

482
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:29,780
All right?

483
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:37,496
Love you.

484
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:23,042
What do you see when you look at this train?

485
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:30,382
I see a fortress to class.

486
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:33,177
Is that all?

487
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:39,725
Well, I see 3000 souls surviving

488
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:44,354
on a planet that's determined
to freeze all life in place.

489
00:42:44,438 --> 00:42:48,358
We're still in motion, alive and kicking,

490
00:42:48,442 --> 00:42:53,030
and it's not thanks to chance
or fate or God.

491
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:57,701
It is thanks to order,
meticulously maintained by Mr. Wilford.

492
00:42:57,785 --> 00:43:02,206
A balance of need and greed and speed,

493
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:05,459
and you Tailies, who seem to have forgotten

494
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:10,547
that it is 117 degrees below zero
outside of this metal tube,

495
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:15,719
and Mr. Wilford is awake 21 hours a day
just to keep the goddamn heat on!

496
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:31,360
Guess that's why it needs informants
like Sean Wise.

497
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:37,241
Wise was a Wilford rat.

498
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:41,787
He got paid in perks

499
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,582
like the rigged Baby Lottery.

500
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:50,462
Why else would you care so much
about a Thirdie's murder?

501
00:43:54,174 --> 00:44:00,848
So, what you really wanna know is,
when he was tortured,

502
00:44:00,931 --> 00:44:03,600
what Wilford secrets did he spill?

503
00:44:09,064 --> 00:44:14,111
Y'all got killers and cannibals

504
00:44:14,194 --> 00:44:15,904
and God knows what else up here.

505
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:23,996
So don't you lecture me about balance.

506
00:44:26,707 --> 00:44:30,335
My people found ours years ago.

507
00:44:34,798 --> 00:44:38,677
Okay. Very perceptive.

508
00:44:39,678 --> 00:44:43,265
No wonder Mr. Wilford
wants you as Train Detective.

509
00:44:47,978 --> 00:44:50,439
But that's the only reason
you're still here now.

510
00:44:51,305 --> 00:45:51,386

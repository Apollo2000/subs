<i>You'd think loneliness
would be impossible all crammed in here,</i>

2
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:14,807
<i>but this train was designed to separate us</i>

3
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:19,437
<i>from our possessions, from our loved ones.</i>

4
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,861
<i>Now every last shred of us
is worth something to someone.</i>

5
00:00:31,908 --> 00:00:35,954
<i>Everything's rare, so you gotta pay
with something personal.</i>

6
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:44,170
<i>And we're all trading up
for the most valuable thing there is. Access.</i>

7
00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:51,469
<i>Access all the way to First,
where they hold the table for sport,</i>

8
00:00:51,553 --> 00:00:55,306
<i>then trade it right back down.</i>

9
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:04,148
<i>People avoid me
because I care for the Sleepers,</i>

10
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:09,320
<i>but that's my value,
how I open doors and live in Second.</i>

11
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:11,197
<i>I can trade for things,</i>

12
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:14,742
<i>while the weakest can only trade
their carbon for compost.</i>

13
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:23,418
<i>So we keep pushing.</i>

14
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:28,381
<i>Pushing uptrain,
pushing for access to feel more alive.</i>

15
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:29,966
<i>Access is freedom.</i>

16
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:32,552
<i>Access is power.</i>

17
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:38,933
<i>We kill for that on Snowpiercer,
1001 cars long.</i>

18

<i>Andre.</i>

20
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:24,395
We don't know what the Night Car is,
what they'll make you do there.

21
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,439
- Anything's better than this.
- Zarah.

22
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:27,607
I'll die.

23
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,110
I can't do it anymore. This is my decision.

24
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:34,197
Hey.

25
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:46,584
We held on to these for a long time,
but they're worth more as a commodity,

26
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:50,046
to trade if you get into trouble.

27
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:54,133
Good luck, Andre.

28
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:00,098
Yeah, there she is.

29
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:01,724
Goddamn sellout!

30
00:03:01,808 --> 00:03:02,934
Yeah, go on.

31
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:07,021
- Go show those rich men how we do in the Tail.
- Four feet away, huh?

32
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:08,523
- Walk away!
- Good for you.

33
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:57,029
All right, can we settle?

34
00:03:57,113 --> 00:03:59,490
Settle down, please.

35
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:03,870
Thank you.

36
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:16,174
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

37
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:20,094
We all know it's been a tough 48 hours.

38
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:24,557
It seems the events have been
on Mr. Wilford's mind, as well.

39
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,352
He's written a personal message for us all.

40
00:04:29,896 --> 00:04:32,064
"To my loyal and trusted crew,

41
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:34,901
without whom this mission
could never succeed,

42
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:40,865
in this time of adversity, I ask you,
the lead stewards of humanity,

43
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:45,912
to remain unshaken in spirit and resolve,

44
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:49,040
as you've done so nobly
these past seven years.

45
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,125
By your steady hand,

46
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:57,298
we will ride out this hardship
and outlive the ice,

47
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:02,261
bound by our cause and our need.

48
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:03,554
Wilford."

49
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:08,184
Winston Churchill.

50
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:10,727
I'm sorry?

51
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:13,689
"Unshaken in spirit and resolve."

52
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:18,027
Mr. Wilford was paraphrasing Churchill.

53
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:21,948
I'll tell him you noticed.

54
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:24,450
Tell him there's unrest brewing.

55
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:27,620
The murders. The Tailie uprising.

56
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:33,835
Third will feel the brunt of the rationing.
There's already talk of job action.

57
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:35,837
To that point,

58
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,007
Mr. Wilford suggests we work to ease
the minds of passengers while we do repairs.

59
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:44,387
Ruth, what if we moved
next week's prizefight up to tonight?

60
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,306
Distraction? It's brilliant.

61
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:52,186
We make an event of it, and the winner
gets a full upgrade from Third to Second.

62
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,774
It's aspirational for Third, and it'll remind First
how good they actually have it.

63
00:05:56,858 --> 00:06:00,611
Commander, you can handle the fight?

64
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:02,947
Of course.

65
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:07,493
- Good. Settled.
- The Engine will provide.

66
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:09,536
Get up!

67
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:19,380
Get off me. Get off me. Get off me!

68
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:30,308
Oh.

69
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:35,563
That frighten you?
It was Mr. Wilford's idea.

70
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:40,067
At least with a bag on my head, I know
how much Wilford actually wants me to see.

71
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:41,986
Let me explain clearly.

72
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:46,365
We each have our place up here, our lane.

73
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:51,078
And until you earn Mr. Wilford's trust,
your lane is narrow.

74
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:56,918
Your only concern is finding out
who tortured and killed Sean Wise.

75
00:06:57,001 --> 00:07:00,838
And if you try communicating with the Tail again,
I'll stick your head out a port myself.

76
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:10,056
Can I have access to the witness
of the first murder yet?

77
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:12,265
No.

78
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:14,769
She's still unconscious.

79
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,813
Well...

80
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:24,153
does Wilford trust me enough to let me
know what Sean Wise was informing on?

81
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:26,822
Yes.

82
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,660
Sean Wise kept tabs on the black market.

83
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:34,163
He was trying to find the source of
a new drug wreaking havoc in Third, Kronole.

84
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:37,917
Kronole's not new.
It's been in the Tail for two revolutions.

85
00:07:40,086 --> 00:07:41,963
Oh, you're not getting a cut?

86
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:45,925
Authoritarian states usually control
their own drug trades.

87
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,802
Snowpiercer's an ark.

88
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:50,304
It's not an authoritarian state.

89
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:51,346
Uh...

90
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:52,515
Okay.

91
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:56,894
Well, if Sean Wise was looking in for Kronole,
that's where we start.

92
00:07:56,978 --> 00:07:59,438
All you gotta do is go down on a Brakeman.

93
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:03,734
Your boy Oz trades K
for blowjobs in the Tail.

94
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:08,990
Well, look at you, detective.

95
00:08:09,073 --> 00:08:10,741
Already working on the case.

96
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:14,912
You should see me without the handcuffs.

97
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:19,250
Brakeman Till, you're out of uniform.

98
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:24,213
Somehow it's my fault
the Tailie got out of his cell.

99
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,132
- I wasn't even...
- You shut up.

100
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,826
Must be pretty nice up here in Second,

101
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:57,329
if you can just lie around in bed all day.

102
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,583
You don't find it a little aspirational?

103
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:09,175
Some of it.

104
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:22,813
Nikki falsely imprisoned?

105
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:26,859
A cannibal ring right under my nose?

106
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:29,070
It's embarrassing.

107
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:35,993
And I can't even find my underwear.

108
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:40,414
Hey.

109
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:45,586
Nikki's our only witness.

110
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:48,214
That bitch from Hospitality's
blocking access to her.

111
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:51,300
Yeah, you won't get much out of Nikki.
She's still confused.

112
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,719
I thought she was unconscious.

113
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:59,141
- I wouldn't go there, Bess.
- Why not?

114
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:02,019
Because if Melanie's doing it,
it's what Wilford wants.

115
00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:08,901
Okay, well, it's that kind of thinking
that put an innocent girl in the Drawers.

116
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,825
Hey.

117
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:19,036
You don't want to cross paths
with Melanie Cavill.

118
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,123
Then I'll go around her.

119
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,714
- Right?
- Yeah.

120
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:32,049
Osweiller.

121
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:34,885
Shifty little dodger.
I can't wait to slap him with this.

122
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:36,053
Good, but hold up.

123
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:40,182
You're at an impasse with this case,
so I'm shaking this tree to make something fall out.

124
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:43,477
Okay, the train is like a small town,
so everyone's gonna know you're coming.

125
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:46,814
Two years ago, you put Nikki in a Drawer
for a crime she didn't commit.

126
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:50,234
Now you don't know if Sean Wise
was murdered by that same psychopath

127
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:53,946
or if it's just somebody else trying to complicate
the murder of a Wilford informant.

128
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:58,117
- Your point?
- My point is I lead this time.

129
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,928
Tailies came pouring out onto us.

130
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:02,204
We started sticking pikes in those animals.

131
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:03,706
- They buckled quick.
- Oz.

132
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:05,958
Heard you went out of there
on your hands and knees.

133
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,002
And you left your partner behind. Move it.

134
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:09,336
Yes, sir.

135
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,553
What's this about, sir?

136
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:19,930
You're trading Kronole for blowjobs
in the Tail.

137
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,349
Gonna listen to a Tailie?

138
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:30,357
- Who's your supplier?
- Supplier?

139
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,776
No, no.

140
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:34,777
Look.

141
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:37,907
I passed a little Kroney to the Tail, okay?

142
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:41,952
But it was just from what we confiscated,
for the Tailie woman whose arm they froze off.

143
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:44,538
It was a humanitarian act.

144
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:46,749
Did you know Sean Wise?

145
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,419
- What, the dead guy?
- Yeah, the dead guy.

146
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,171
Why? What's that got to do with it?

147
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:54,882
I swear on the train, boss.

148
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:06,185
Watch the neckline, yeah?

149
00:12:09,355 --> 00:12:12,358
- Terence, I was coming to see you.
- Oh, shut it.

150
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:16,111
Why is the Lead Brakeman leaning on you?

151
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:19,156
Was asking about Kroney.
I didn't say nothing.

152
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:24,161
That's good.
What about the Tailie detective he's with?

153
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:28,832
We pulled him out
to work on the Sean Wise murder.

154
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:35,005
- So how'd he get to Kroney?
- He's smart. Don't know.

155
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:38,842
I wouldn't underestimate him.

156
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:40,386
Don't worry about that.

157
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:43,681
We'll give that cop a nice warm welcome.

158
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,733
<i>♪ Gone in a blink ♪</i>

159
00:12:58,237 --> 00:12:59,237
Roche.

160
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:00,239
Look, hey.

161
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:01,740
I already told you.

162
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:03,325
Zarah didn't kill the Wilford rat.

163
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:06,120
Well, she was gonna
have a baby with him, wasn't she?

164
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:08,747
Look, she lived with him.

165
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:10,582
What did he tell her?

166
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:14,044
You talked to my guy.
Now I'm gonna talk to yours.

167
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:18,966
Sean worked for Ag-Sec.

168
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,926
He was also a spy.

169
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,220
I didn't know he had anything to do
with any of this.

170
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:24,847
- He mention Kronole to you?
- No.

171
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,391
Anybody connected
with making it or distributing it?

172
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,893
No, he didn't mention drugs at all.

173
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:34,315
I mean, he bragged sometimes about knowing
people who could get him whatever he needed.

174
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:38,610
You're not new here.
You know how the underground works.

175
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:41,697
Who was it? Tunnelmen?

176
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,283
Night Car staff?

177
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:45,451
Janitors?

178
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:47,745
I don't know anything specific.

179
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:51,415
You're saying he was a spy,
so he wasn't sharing it with us.

180
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,418
Is that it?
Because I gotta get ready for Fight Night.

181
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:56,420
What's that?

182
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:59,381
Don't worry. You won't be attending.

183
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,343
- Janitors.
- It's okay.

184
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:11,143
- That's another one.
- Whoo! Off with it!

185
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:16,815
Run along, now, girls.

186
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:18,317
Evening.

187
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,777
Hi.

188
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:26,950
- Fight night? Perhaps you lose something.
- Robert loves a fight. Don't you, Robert?

189
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:32,623
Ruth, I see you, with your surprise casino
and your Roman games.

190
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:36,085
You're just misdirecting us
from an extinction event.

191
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:37,920
Snap!

192
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:44,218
Seriously, Ruth, we realize
that this is no longer a pleasure cruise.

193
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:48,680
But our fortunes built this train,
and Mr. Wilford is losing control.

194
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:53,018
Resources crashing.
Insurrection in the Tail.

195
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,230
Fight Night is nothing
but a bold-faced distraction.

196
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:01,110
Yes, but it's an entertaining distraction.

197
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:06,532
Please, show solidarity with the train.
These people work hard, you know.

198
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,867
And it lifts them just to see you.

199
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:11,578
Yeah, Mom, do it for the Thirdies.

200
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:13,038
- Snap!
- Pfft.

201
00:15:13,122 --> 00:15:14,206
Come on!

202
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:16,875
Come on, Daddy.

203
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:19,253
Come on, sweetheart.

204
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:23,132
Let's make a night of it.
You can get dressed up.

205
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,818
Married, right?

206
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:45,362
Twenty years.

207
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:47,656
Kids?

208
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,286
We doing this?

209
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:57,374
Three kids.

210
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,502
Two of them didn't make it.

211
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,550
Hard choices.

212
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,260
We hold them close,

213
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,221
they keep us going.

214
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,767
It was the same thing
when Zarah went uptrain.

215
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:20,439
- She was my warmth.
- Tomato soup and a grilled cheese.

216
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:35,037
Think Sean Wise got killed
on this Kronole tip?

217
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,666
Or did Wilford's rat just get
his dick chopped off by a serial perv?

218
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,587
You ever meet Wilford?

219
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:48,258
Shook his hand a few times before we boarded,
but the Engine's bio-secure now.

220
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:49,801
He speaks through Melanie.

221
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,140
- Hey, I told you to stay home.
- I got something.

222
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:58,602
- It turns out Nikki's awake.
- Okay. Take Layton.

223
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,187
Keep an eye on him.

224
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,397
- I'm having my lunch.
- Let's go.

225
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:17,204
- Hey.
- I've got the crack under control.

226
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:19,414
Bojan's team is behind
on the Cattle Car window.

227
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:21,875
Oh, shit.

228
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,169
We can't keep pumping heat down here.

229
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:27,214
- Main banks are near an all-time low.
- And more mountains to come.

230
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,635
- I can offer one immediate solution.
- What?

231
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:32,719
We uncouple the Tail.

232
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:41,103
I mean, we move the Tailies into Third,
cut the empty weight loose onto a siding.

233
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:44,064
There'd be civil war in Third.

234
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:47,401
I need a more viable solution.

235
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,073
God, I wish I were welding.

236
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,576
Ma'am? Ma'am?

237
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,494
Ma'am, I...

238
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:02,791
This is Melanie.

239
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,877
- It's me.
<i>- Hey, what's up?</i>

240
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,340
<i>We don't want the investigators
to see Nikki like this, right?</i>

241
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:12,134
No. Why?

242
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:16,179
Till might be on her way soon.

243
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,683
Thanks, Jinju.

244
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:30,611
- Make it quick. She's to be off-limits.
- Nikki?

245
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:33,030
Nikki.

246
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:34,114
She's out of it.

247
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,617
That's a common post-suspension reaction.

248
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,661
- Yeah, she's got a fever.
- That's perfectly normal.

249
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:42,080
It's not like sleep.

250
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:44,833
- What's not? The Drawers?
- She's just disoriented.

251
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:48,670
Everyone comes out of it a little differently.
She's gonna be fine in a few days.

252
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:50,547
Nikki, can you open your mouth for me?

253
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:54,051
Oh,
I wouldn't recommend that.

254
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:57,012
- Oh, Jesus.
- Looks a lot like Kronole withdrawal, doesn't it?

255
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,848
- She's just a long-term Sleeper.
- Has anyone given you Kronole?

256
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,725
- Course not.
- What's Kronole?

257
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:05,479
- Will it make me feel better?
- She's not cleared for visitors yet, doctor.

258
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:06,688
We heard she was awake.

259
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:09,399
That doesn't mean
she's ready to be questioned.

260
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:12,486
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Now. Now.

261
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:15,280
Please, let's let her rest.

262
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:19,576
This is bullshit. Is your suspension
drug some version of Kronole?

263
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:21,535
Of course not.

264
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:25,582
- Her gums are black.
- That's a common post-suspension reaction.

265
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:29,586
Maybe it's the other way around. Maybe
Kronole's a street version of their drug.

266
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,297
The materials are tightly controlled.

267
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:34,925
It's not possible, is it?

268
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:42,474
Klimpt, what have you done?

269
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,818
You skimmed the suspension drug.
Then what?

270
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,444
Who did you give it to?

271
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:55,529
Courier comes.

272
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,698
Sometimes it's a janitor.

273
00:19:57,781 --> 00:19:59,991
- Different person each time.
- What did you get?

274
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:03,787
Just supplies for the Sleepers.

275
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:08,041
Vegetable balms to prevent bedsores.

276
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,377
Mr. Wilford didn't think of everything.

277
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:16,049
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I had no idea they made Kronole from it.

278
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,428
Would you give us a moment, please?

279
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:31,356
- What's going on with these two?
- That's what I wanna know.

280
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:39,072
What the hell is this?
What the hell is this?

281
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,576
- This is Miles' hair.
- Layton.

282
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:43,952
Miles?

283
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:45,370
- Layton, stop.
- Miles.

284
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:46,830
- Layton, stop!
- What did you do?

285
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,708
- Stop it!
- Stop! It's not what you think.

286
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:54,087
Miles made the apprenticeship program.

287
00:20:57,466 --> 00:21:00,010
- He made apprentice?
- Yes.

288
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:03,263
And he's fine. We just gave him a haircut.

289
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,142
I wanna see him right now.

290
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:14,232
Objects in motion stay in motion
at the same velocity, unless...

291
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:15,358
Anybody?

292
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:18,068
Miles.

293
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:21,615
The object is acted on by an external force.

294
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:22,866
Correct.

295
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,159
Thank you, Miles.

296
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:29,623
I got my own bunk with a curtain,
my own fork, and I ate this thing.

297
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:32,083
It's called a tangerine.

298
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,127
Heard you're nailing the science too, bro.

299
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:37,547
- I have a hundred percent on all my tests.
- See? That's what I'm talking about.

300
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:41,051
- You're gonna be an engineer.
- I don't know about that.

301
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:48,099
Josie's gonna be worried about us.

302
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,685
Yeah, she is.

303
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:56,399
You see any of the other kids
from the apprenticeship?

304
00:21:57,818 --> 00:22:00,403
Mikala's apprenticing in Laundry.

305
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:03,240
And Mia... I don't know.

306
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,495
Miles, it's time for dinner.

307
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:09,788
Oof.

308
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:10,997
Don't you love dinner?

309
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:22,634
I'm keeping my eyes open.

310
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:51,079
Let me down.

311
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,086
That was Blanca Peak.

312
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:01,423
- What's the problem?
- We should have passed it yesterday.

313
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,887
We should be running full tilt,
banking power to climb the Sierra Madres.

314
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,514
So the impact yesterday
caused some serious damage?

315
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:12,851
We were already losing time.
Whatever happened made it a lot worse.

316
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:15,687
The Year Four Slowdown lasted a month.

317
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,315
Started with darkness, water rations.

318
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:23,486
Question is, when does our drain
on resources outweigh our value as labor?

319
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,239
Right before the Sierra Madres, I reckon.

320
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:28,950
- Look, look, look!
- We're a day behind!

321
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:31,161
Wilford hasn't uncoupled us yet.

322
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:33,914
- All we've got to do is hunker down.
- Agreed.

323
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:36,166
Double bunks, half water.

324
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:37,626
- Mm-hm. Agreed.
- Agreed.

325
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:40,253
All right. Let's pull everyone forward.

326
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:41,963
Double up to conserve heat.

327
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:43,107
- Okay.
- All right?

328
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:46,927
Our people uptrain will help us, somehow.

329
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:53,892
Thank you for letting me see him.

330
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:56,978
Well, hopefully now
we can focus on our next steps.

331
00:23:57,979 --> 00:23:59,356
Melanie.

332
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:03,652
I have to see Josie, his Tail mom.

333
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:06,154
I convinced her to let him go.

334
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:07,864
I know she's worried sick about him.

335
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:11,868
Till can give her a message
next time she's down there.

336
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:16,665
Look, she really needs to hear from me
that he is okay.

337
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:20,752
How about when you ID Sean Wise's killer,
I'll let you see her?

338
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:23,672
It's too late to get downtrain, anyway.
The fights are tonight.

339
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:25,465
Yeah, I was just thinking that.

340
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:29,177
Fight Night.

341
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:32,472
Feels like a pretty good place
to find a Janitor.

342
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:36,559
Yeah, but if they're slinging Kronole,
they're not exactly gonna sit down

343
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:39,062
and have a chat with the Train Detective.

344
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,564
How about we leave that
to the Train Detective?

345
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:46,236
Watch his back, Brakeman.

346
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:54,911
<i>Members of the board, as you well know...</i>

347
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:59,165
<i>As you well know, I am not one for speeches.</i>

348
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:01,543
<i>...one for speeches.</i>

349
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:03,146
<i>But we've been...</i>

350
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:05,964
<i>After exceeding earnings
in the fourth-quarter financials,</i>

351
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:09,259
<i>it's safe to say that we've
been through a bumpy patch.</i>

352
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:14,931
<i>I am not one for speeches,
but we've been through a bumpy patch.</i>

353
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:17,142
<i>And my advisers tell me...</i>

354
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:19,936
<i>So I want to say this to you.</i>

355
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,109
<i>Attention all passengers.</i>

356
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,403
<i>Due to ongoing engineering repairs,</i>

357
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:33,158
<i>Second and Third Class may experience
diminished electrical supply.</i>

358
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:37,829
<i>From all of us at Wilford Industries,
thank you for your patience.</i>

359
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:53,094
<i>Fight! Fight! Fight!</i>

360
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:20,413
Yeah! Come on!

361
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:21,623
Okay.

362
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:27,170
- First Class. It's up there.
- Hey!

363
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:29,422
One fox fur on Right Hand Man!

364
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:33,468
One of the fighters is a Janitor.

365
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:37,931
That's them in white.

366
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:41,518
But I don't really know who's who over there.
It's not my beat.

367
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:49,317
<i>Good evening, passengers.</i>

368
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,239
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Fight Night.

369
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:58,243
Kind of everywhere, isn't she?

370
00:26:58,326 --> 00:27:01,955
The prize tonight for the victor,
a coveted upgrade to Second Class.

371
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:06,960
<i>But before we begin,
it is my honor to announce</i>

372
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:12,132
that Mr. Wilford himself
would like to say a few words.

373
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:17,720
<i>Thanks.
Good evening, passengers.</i>

374
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:23,309
<i>As you well know, I'm not one for speeches,
but we've been through a bumpy patch.</i>

375
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:25,812
<i>So I want to say this to you.</i>

376
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:32,068
<i>If the track has taught me anything, it's that even
the steepest climbs give way to descent.</i>

377
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:36,948
<i>I'll keep doing what I do best.
I will keep our Engine eternal.</i>

378
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:42,954
<i>And you keep doing what you do best.
Survive, survive, survive.</i>

379
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:47,041
Survive! Survive! The Engine will provide!

380
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:50,044
<i>Wilford! Wilford! Wilford!</i>

381
00:27:52,964 --> 00:27:55,133
<i>Wilford! Wilford! Wilford!</i>

382
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,805
And on that note, let the fight begin.

383
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,516
Wait back there.

384
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:07,770
Come on, Tina girl! Cut him down!

385
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:13,818
Zarah's working behind the bar.

386
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:16,236
All right.

387
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:18,405
Hey.

388
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,659
She's never gonna talk to me
with you attached to my hip.

389
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:26,497
I know this woman, okay?

390
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:29,542
We're gonna get a lot more information
out of her if I go alone.

391
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:31,920
All right, go.

392
00:28:32,003 --> 00:28:35,590
Hey, keep an eye on those guys, all right?
Make sure none of them leave.

393
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:38,551
And watch your back.

394
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,140
Hey.

395
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:45,224
There he is.

396
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,019
The Train Detective.

397
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:51,314
I hope that's his undercover look.

398
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:13,461
- I'm so glad you're still okay.
- Who are these Janitors?

399
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:18,549
The guy with the beard over there is Terence,
Sean's Kronole connection.

400
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:20,218
Keep chasing him! Go, go!

401
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:22,804
He's Head Janitor. Watch yourself with him.

402
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:24,514
Oh, I just wanna say hello.

403
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:27,100
I can ask if he'll meet with you.

404
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:30,395
- How bad do you need this?
- It's the first key.

405
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:33,064
Well, there's always a price with Terence.

406
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:37,527
My wedding ring.

407
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:43,741
You gave it to me the day I left the Tail.

408
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:47,787
I traded mine, but I kept yours,

409
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,456
so you can have it back,
so you can trade it if you need to.

410
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:58,089
I've been thinking about what you said,
about staying up here with you.

411
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:02,260
I still love you, Zarah.

412
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:07,807
- But...
- I know, Andre.

413
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:11,019
I know the Tail needs you.

414
00:30:12,562 --> 00:30:14,522
I love you too.

415
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,015
You're not a Janitor, Brakeman.

416
00:31:32,016 --> 00:31:33,559
Surprise, surprise.

417
00:31:33,643 --> 00:31:36,813
They didn't wanna deal
with Wilford's pet Detective.

418
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:43,194
Wilford sent me up here
to pry into their business.

419
00:31:44,195 --> 00:31:46,364
If I was Terence, I'd wanna talk to me.

420
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:53,496
- Twice in one day, I'm stuck dealing with you.
- And I need to speak with Terence.

421
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:56,582
So you come here?
You know he can't risk you.

422
00:31:56,666 --> 00:32:00,837
A bloody Tailie on top of that.
You're just pissing him off.

423
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:05,842
So you go out there,
and you tell him that I got eyes on me too.

424
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:09,262
I'm gonna lose Till,
so that we can be alone.

425
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:10,388
Okay.

426
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:15,226
You think I don't have more dirt
on you, Osweiller?

427
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:19,147
Me and your boss, Roche,
we getting pretty close.

428
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,607
I could probably just make some shit up.

429
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:25,653
Or maybe Terence never sees Kronole again.

430
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:31,242
Go tell him, Brakeman.

431
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:36,831
You're bleeding crazy, man.

432
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:44,755
Come on, get up!

433
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:54,098
Oh, shit. Nikki? Nikki?

434
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:57,643
- Right hand.
- Two hands. Give me something.

435
00:32:57,727 --> 00:32:58,769
Come on, Tina!

436
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:02,607
- What are you doing here?
- I need Kronole.

437
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:06,736
Look, look, look. Remember who that is?

438
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:12,033
She killed someone. What's she doing out?

439
00:33:12,116 --> 00:33:13,993
She's innocent.

440
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:25,129
Mr. Layton, you're a pain in the ass.

441
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:29,133
Come on.

442
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,330
- Put her down!
- Put her back!

443
00:33:41,354 --> 00:33:43,105
Let her go!

444
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:42,331
Well, if it isn't the famous Tailie Detective.
You want a date?

445
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:44,542
Hm?

446
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:58,889
Name's Terence.

447
00:34:58,973 --> 00:35:00,433
Never Terry.

448
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:06,772
So you come out to solve a murder,
and my chemicals dry up.

449
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:11,444
That shit's poison, Terence.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

450
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:18,951
- You ever sell Kronole to Sean Wise?
- Why?

451
00:35:19,035 --> 00:35:24,457
- Because he was screwing your wife?
- No. Because he was a Wilford informant.

452
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:29,795
Well, I didn't kill him.

453
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:32,131
- Don't put that on me.
- No.

454
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:35,343
- You don't want that kind of publicity.
- Yeah.

455
00:35:36,344 --> 00:35:41,390
So, um, how much does Wilford know
about his Kroney problem?

456
00:35:41,474 --> 00:35:42,725
Very little, yet.

457
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:47,480
But if I give him something about this murder,
he'll probably forget about the whole thing.

458
00:35:56,197 --> 00:36:00,618
You know what I was in the Old Time
before I was a Janitor?

459
00:36:01,744 --> 00:36:02,744
A janitor.

460
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:09,210
I cleaned a high-rise building.
I get on this train, and you know what I see?

461
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:12,213
The train is just a high-rise laying
on its side.

462
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:15,299
I know how this thing runs.

463
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:19,345
And my building just became
the whole goddamn world.

464
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:22,223
Some people never had it so good.

465
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:25,685
Well, still looking for better.

466
00:36:26,686 --> 00:36:30,981
Third Class and the Tail,
70 percent of the population.

467
00:36:31,065 --> 00:36:32,066
Yeah.

468
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:35,903
Maybe we could see who's in the penthouse.

469
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:41,951
It's nice to dream.

470
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:53,921
I saw Sean the night he was killed.

471
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:59,802
He came down to score K with another guy,
no one I'd seen before.

472
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:01,303
Can you describe him?

473
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:03,389
Not from these corridors, no.

474
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:05,141
First Class, maybe.

475
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:10,604
Early 30s, buzz cut, takes care of himself.

476
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:25,411
There's one more thing I need, Terence.

477
00:37:25,494 --> 00:37:28,330
Something very small.

478
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:35,963
Home you go, people!

479
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:37,715
The border is closed!

480
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:40,676
The subtrain to Third is out of order,
you're walking home to Third.

481
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,638
It was a great success,
despite a riot breaking out.

482
00:37:44,722 --> 00:37:46,140
Maybe even because of it.

483
00:37:46,223 --> 00:37:49,393
Well, I'll put the riot to bed,
you put them to bed.

484
00:37:49,477 --> 00:37:52,688
And, Ruth, good job.

485
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:56,275
It's an honor just to carry out
Mr. Wilford's wishes.

486
00:37:58,277 --> 00:37:59,779
All right.

487
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:03,657
The border is closed!
No pushing. Nice and easy, please.

488
00:38:03,741 --> 00:38:05,951
Keep it calm!

489
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:10,080
- I got some information for you.
- What?

490
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:12,208
Last call, I'm afraid.

491
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:13,292
Shame.

492
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,878
We were just waltzing
down the Champs-Élysées.

493
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,963
You're good.

494
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:21,342
Oh, well, you may have distracted us
for one night, Melanie,

495
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:25,304
but in a year or two, when you serve up
history's last boeuf bourguignon...

496
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:29,391
I won't lie. It's serious.

497
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:32,853
Mr. Wilford could always cut loose the Tail.

498
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:35,815
I'm glad you had a good evening.

499
00:38:36,816 --> 00:38:37,817
And safe home, LJ.

500
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:42,321
Come along, darling.

501
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:46,700
Everybody out the door. This way.

502
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:49,745
Okay, I'll meet you there later.

503
00:38:54,583 --> 00:39:00,005
Layton has the description of a man who was
with Sean Wise just before he was murdered.

504
00:39:00,089 --> 00:39:01,005
But?

505
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:03,926
Oh, I'm not gonna tell you till you let me
go see Josie in the Tail.

506
00:39:13,811 --> 00:39:15,813
Josie Wellstead.

507
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:51,807
I thought you were dead.

508
00:39:51,891 --> 00:39:54,018
What did they do to you?
Why did they pull you out?

509
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:55,352
I'm fine.

510
00:39:56,353 --> 00:39:58,355
I'm fine. Just listen.

511
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:03,569
I talked to Miles. You'd be so proud.

512
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:05,237
He's in a class.

513
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:07,823
He's learning real science.

514
00:40:07,907 --> 00:40:10,117
- And you saw him?
- And he's eating.

515
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,286
Three squares.

516
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:14,330
He's got his own fork.

517
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:20,794
I saw Zarah.

518
00:40:20,878 --> 00:40:22,296
I had it all wrong in my head.

519
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:27,176
This whole time, I've not been seeing
what was right in front of my eyes.

520
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:32,765
I miss you, Josie, and I am so sorry.

521
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:36,518
Me too.

522
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:38,729
I miss you too.

523
00:40:40,981 --> 00:40:41,981
That's enough.

524
00:40:44,693 --> 00:40:47,905
He's got his own bed.
And there's other kids.

525
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:50,866
And he misses you, Josie!

526
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:53,702
It's only doors between us!

527
00:41:06,382 --> 00:41:08,467
So who are we looking for?

528
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:56,784
You don't remember me, do you, Nikki?

529
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:05,626
But you do know who I am.

530
00:43:06,305 --> 00:44:06,560

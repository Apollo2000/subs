1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,745
Adapt.

2
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:10,358
That's what humans do, isn't it?

3
00:00:10,401 --> 00:00:12,708
Our great leg up.

4
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:14,188
We roll.

5
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:15,754
We hack.

6
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:17,365
Knuckle down and change.

8
00:00:29,116 --> 00:00:32,293
Even Snowpiercer
is an adaptation.

9
00:00:32,336 --> 00:00:34,077
That was classic Wilford.

10
00:00:38,734 --> 00:00:40,214
While the world froze

11
00:00:40,257 --> 00:00:42,738
and the other mega-rich
tried to hole up in bunkers

12
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:45,436
or upload their consciousness,

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,875
Mr. Wilford
dusted off his train set.

14
00:01:03,976 --> 00:01:06,849
Snowpiercer is His system.

15
00:01:06,892 --> 00:01:08,938
Systems resist change,

16
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:11,506
even without their maker.

17
00:01:12,985 --> 00:01:14,770
I'm just a scientist.

18
00:01:14,813 --> 00:01:18,774
I'm here to save the world,
not change it.

19
00:01:18,817 --> 00:01:23,039
I know our chances of surviving
are slim at best.

20
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,475
All I can do about that

21
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:29,828
is provide small moments
of happiness on Snowpiercer,

22
00:01:29,872 --> 00:01:32,135
1,001 cars long.

23
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:58,379
Yeah?

24
00:02:00,337 --> 00:02:02,122
Hey.

25
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:04,950
I knew you'd be up.

26
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:06,648
No rest
for the weary.

27
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:08,389
What's up?

28
00:02:08,432 --> 00:02:11,174
I need you to take care of
yourself, Mel.

29
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:13,437
We can't afford
you getting sick.

30
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:15,657
There's mountingsupply-chain issues,

31
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,485
and now you're taking
thismurder investigation

32
00:02:17,528 --> 00:02:18,399
on your own?

33
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:20,792
I appreciate your concern.

34
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:22,751
I do.

35
00:02:24,056 --> 00:02:26,015
Anything else?

36
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:27,886
Yes.

37
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,194
I want you to
ask for help.

38
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:36,895
Help.

39
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:46,340
Layton, wake up.

40
00:02:46,383 --> 00:02:48,994
We need you.What happened?

41
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:50,518
You'll see.

42
00:02:54,826 --> 00:02:55,827
Thank you.

43
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:57,002
Thank you.

44
00:02:58,743 --> 00:03:01,572
So, have you thought of
a workaround

45
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:04,053
for the methane
shortage?

46
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:06,577
Yep.

47
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:07,665
Goat farts.

48
00:03:09,276 --> 00:03:11,365
Very good.

49
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:12,496
MIT.

50
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:14,933
I knew
it would pay off.

51
00:03:20,765 --> 00:03:23,464
Melanie Cavill.

52
00:03:24,552 --> 00:03:27,468
I'm not afraid
to be seen together.

53
00:03:27,511 --> 00:03:28,686
You just don't want to

54
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,514
walk to work with me
in the morning?

55
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:34,475
Jinju, there's enough track
talkabout me as it is.

56
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:38,609
Hey, you got to step up
for this, babe.

57
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:41,960
Isn't that
what I just did?

58
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:44,049
Oh, you did, huh?

59
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:49,272
And I will. I just...
Give me a minute.

60
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:52,536
Thirdies are weird about
dating uptrain.

61
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,410
What's the difference whetherit's
uptrain or downtrain?

62
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:57,846
You're from Second.

63
00:03:57,889 --> 00:03:59,761
You have the privilege of
seeing it that way.

64
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:05,245
Okay, baby, I know you're
notenticed by all this

65
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:07,247
'cause you're from Detroit...

66
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:10,467
Hey.

67
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:12,904
I'm from San Francisco.

68
00:04:12,948 --> 00:04:15,080
Those places are gone,

69
00:04:15,124 --> 00:04:18,170
but now it's up to usto start over.

70
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:29,921
Agricultural Officer.

71
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:31,836
Nikki Genet is dead.

72
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:50,420
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:50,464 --> 00:04:52,770
I know how much
you cared for her.

74
00:04:52,814 --> 00:04:56,034
Okay, stop now.

75
00:04:56,078 --> 00:04:58,341
Stop it, Henry.

76
00:04:59,821 --> 00:05:01,475
I'm gonna give you a chance
to make things right

77
00:05:01,518 --> 00:05:03,825
with Mr. Wilford.

78
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:06,175
Thank you.

79
00:05:06,218 --> 00:05:07,698
I'm so sorry.

80
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:10,353
I want you to go get a gurney
and some sheets.

81
00:05:10,397 --> 00:05:12,050
Don't let anyone see her.

82
00:05:12,094 --> 00:05:15,227
We need postmortem data.

83
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:17,012
Do you understand
what I'm asking you?

84
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:18,361
Yes.

85
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:21,059
Will you do that for me,
Henry?

86
00:05:23,105 --> 00:05:24,062
Thank you.

87
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,377
Where were you?

88
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:37,293
I gave you a description
of a First Class killer.

89
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,991
What did you
do with it?

90
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:46,694
I was waiting
till morning.

91
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:49,871
First waits
till morning.

92
00:05:49,914 --> 00:05:53,396
She's dead... our killer gets
his bacon and eggs.

93
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,617
Shut up, Layton.
We all failed her.

94
00:06:00,664 --> 00:06:02,927
The border's closed.

95
00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:04,407
I just came from Second.

96
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:06,583
It's been closed
since the fight.

97
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:08,411
The killer's
from First.

98
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:10,108
If he followed you,
he left the fight early.

99
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:11,719
No time to get uptrain.

100
00:06:11,762 --> 00:06:14,112
Then he's still
in Third.

101
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,736
How we doin'?

102
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:30,259
Switching
to breakfast.

103
00:06:30,302 --> 00:06:32,609
'Round and 'round
she goes.

104
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:34,132
You want
one last Railman's?

105
00:06:34,176 --> 00:06:35,960
Nah.

106
00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:40,922
Any word how long they'rekeeping
that damn border closed?

107
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:43,098
They'll close it all night
if they want.

108
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:45,361
That fight was a mess.

109
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,276
Where you from?

110
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:49,147
Second?

111
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:50,845
Yeah.

112
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:09,907
Hey, these are
First Class booze tokens.

113
00:07:11,822 --> 00:07:14,172
I mean...thanks.

114
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:20,309
Alright, how many mendo you have uptrain?

115
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:21,615
We've got plenty.

116
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:24,879
Okay, send a sweep team
uptrainfrom the Tail.

117
00:07:24,922 --> 00:07:26,141
Eyes up, son.

118
00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:27,969
We've got it
from here.

119
00:07:28,012 --> 00:07:30,667
Mr. Layton doesn't really need
to see this, does he?

120
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:32,147
They don't even knowwho they're chasing.

121
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,322
I need to go to First.

122
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:34,758
He doesn't set one foot
in First.

123
00:07:34,802 --> 00:07:37,195
He does whatever
Mr. Wilford wants.

124
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:38,980
Yes?

125
00:07:39,023 --> 00:07:40,460
Let's get every
First Class passenger

126
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:41,635
that was at the fight
out of bed.

127
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:42,723
That will not
be popular.

128
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:44,507
Popular?

129
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:47,467
You people have a serial killer...
Hey.

130
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:50,513
Tone it down,
would you?

131
00:07:50,557 --> 00:07:52,515
I need to know thatthe search is underway,

132
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:56,127
and then you and I
will go to First.

133
00:07:56,171 --> 00:07:58,739
You have to clear that
with Mr. Wilford,

134
00:07:58,782 --> 00:08:00,218
or is that your call?

135
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:09,184
When you're ready,
I'll be talking to her.

136
00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:11,360
Alright, my Brakemen
will work down from here.

137
00:08:11,403 --> 00:08:14,015
We'll open every door.
We'll check every cupboard.

138
00:08:14,058 --> 00:08:16,539
And meet my men in the middleat Ag-Sec.

139
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,759
Start a sweep team uptrain
from the Tail, then.

140
00:08:18,802 --> 00:08:21,109
From there,we will review all...

141
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,029
What about
the subtrain?

142
00:08:28,072 --> 00:08:30,118
It's still closed tononessential personnel.

143
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:31,380
I'll put anotherpatrol down there anyway.

144
00:08:34,252 --> 00:08:35,558
He's not suspended?

145
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:36,864
We're shorthanded.
We need every man we've got.

146
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:38,909
-He was slinging Kroney.
-He's your partner.

147
00:08:38,953 --> 00:08:40,868
Work it out now.
Work it out later.

148
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:43,261
Just do your freakin' job.Go.

149
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:57,449
I'm sorry for your loss.

150
00:09:00,888 --> 00:09:03,760
If the killer's
from First,

151
00:09:03,804 --> 00:09:05,936
they'll only let youget so far,

152
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,157
and there won't beany justice for Nikki.

153
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:12,856
How's Third gonna
take that?

154
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,599
Both victims
are theirs.

155
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:20,037
Oh, that remains to be seen,Detective.

156
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:26,261
Now that I got a sense
of what you do here,

157
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:29,786
I thought you might
have a take on it.

158
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,528
You know people,
high and low.

159
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,617
You know their secrets.

160
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:36,619
Strict confidentiality.

161
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:39,056
It's assured
in the Nightcar.

162
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,450
I appreciate that.

163
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:43,757
Mm.

164
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,586
Melanie Cavill
ever have a session?

165
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:48,457
That would be
confidential...

166
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,719
if the answer
wasn't no.

167
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:51,460
She's never shown herself
like that.

168
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:57,161
Maybe now
she'll have to.

169
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:02,689
Think Nikki's death could be
a catalyst?

170
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,735
Catalyst for what?

171
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:07,128
From what I hear,

172
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:09,173
a lot of workers in Third
are pretty fed up.

173
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:14,004
You need to step carefully,Detective.

174
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:18,313
But many of us
do want change.

175
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:24,493
We're waking First.

176
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,411
Audrey, I promise I'll do
everything I can...

177
00:10:29,454 --> 00:10:31,413
Cut the shit, Melanie.

178
00:10:31,456 --> 00:10:34,155
You have my support,Detective.

179
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,511
I'm holding
the subtrain.

180
00:10:42,554 --> 00:10:45,035
Not a lot of downtrain faith
that the powers that be

181
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:46,994
actually want to
solve this thing

182
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:49,387
now that the suspect's
from First.

183
00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:51,172
I want it solved.

184
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:54,610
And it doesn't matter
whichClass the suspect is from.

185
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,568
Let's go.

186
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,533
I've never seen
a blue chip before.

187
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:07,797
Could be First Class,open heaps of doors.

188
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:09,930
Layton said, "It's only doors
between us."

189
00:11:09,973 --> 00:11:11,453
You can't just
chip out of the Tail.

190
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:14,456
No, but someone could
chip out of Sanitation crew.

191
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:15,979
Ah, the break room.

192
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:17,459
There's that door
with the key pad.

193
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:18,765
They think
we can't use it.

194
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:20,114
You've been stashing suppliesthere, right?

195
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:21,811
Yeah.
Things we scrounge on shift.

196
00:11:21,855 --> 00:11:23,291
Any clothes?Yeah.

197
00:11:23,334 --> 00:11:26,424
Okay, so, if we get someonein
the corridors, then what?

198
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:27,817
We make contact
with Astrid.

199
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:29,950
Since she apprenticed out
in the first year,

200
00:11:29,993 --> 00:11:33,780
guys, we've heard from her,
what, twice?

201
00:11:33,823 --> 00:11:35,129
Astrid's still
one of us.

202
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:36,696
She's got people here.

203
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:39,655
If she can find Layton, we canset
up communication with him.

204
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:42,179
Give me the chip.

205
00:11:42,223 --> 00:11:43,833
I'll try tonight.

206
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:55,802
John, you're a lion.

207
00:11:55,845 --> 00:11:58,587
They don't see Tailie womenuptrain.

208
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,416
I've got a better chanceof blending in.

209
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:05,072
It's true.

210
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:11,034
This is the only keywe've ever had.

211
00:12:20,478 --> 00:12:21,436
Sanitation!

212
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,796
Hey, what happened
to your friend?

213
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,277
Uh, he's too sick
to work, sir.

214
00:12:37,408 --> 00:12:39,280
Okay.

215
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:59,604
Come on. This way.

216
00:12:59,648 --> 00:13:01,519
Strip.

217
00:13:02,564 --> 00:13:08,657
It's inhuman.

218
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:44,388
You got to be kidding me.

219
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:47,957
Art belongs
to First now?

220
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:51,656
These people broiled the
Earth,then they froze her,

221
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,354
and now they hang the spoilson their walls.

222
00:13:53,397 --> 00:13:58,315
Layton, I was a born on a dirt
farm in Eastern Pennsylvania.

223
00:13:58,359 --> 00:14:00,709
I came from nothing.

224
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:02,929
I know a thing or twoabout class.

225
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:06,846
That anger that you feel
when you look at all of this?

226
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:09,413
It's justified.

227
00:14:09,457 --> 00:14:11,285
Let's use it.

228
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:12,721
Whoever the killer is,

229
00:14:12,764 --> 00:14:14,201
First is going to
protect their own,

230
00:14:14,244 --> 00:14:17,204
so you be their worst nightmare
from the Tail.

231
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:20,207
I'll do the rest.

232
00:14:39,617 --> 00:14:41,576
Tailie.

233
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,411
Alright,
two things first.

234
00:14:50,454 --> 00:14:53,588
I don't give a shit
who you are,

235
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:55,111
and somebody up here
has got a thing

236
00:14:55,155 --> 00:14:57,200
for chopping off
Third Class dicks.

237
00:14:59,637 --> 00:15:02,858
Now, look... Yeah, I'm looking.

238
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:06,340
Here's the thing.

239
00:15:06,383 --> 00:15:08,081
Ruth.

240
00:15:08,124 --> 00:15:11,258
I don't see everybody
who was at the fight.

241
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:12,912
This is everybody.

242
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:14,914
Melanie,
this is ridiculous.

243
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:18,221
No one from First Class has
everbeen charged with a crime.

244
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,270
You should
thank her for that.

245
00:15:23,313 --> 00:15:27,230
She keeps the borders tight,
she keeps the rabble at bay,

246
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:29,450
and she keeps First Class
above the law.

247
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:33,062
But Mr. Wilford's doing things
differently this time.

248
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:36,065
Isn't that right?

249
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:37,806
Yes.

250
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:39,808
Now...

251
00:15:41,766 --> 00:15:44,378
...where are
the bodyguards?

252
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:48,817
Alright, let me try this
a different way.

253
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:54,301
How many arms
did you take in the Tail?

254
00:15:56,868 --> 00:16:01,047
14,
if anyone's counting.

255
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,311
So, where are
the bodyguards?

256
00:16:06,574 --> 00:16:08,793
I didn't
invite the help.

257
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:11,666
Erik didn't come home
last night.

258
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,235
He didn't?

259
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:17,193
No.

260
00:16:17,237 --> 00:16:19,195
He asked to
leave the fight early,

261
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:21,197
and when we came back,
he wasn't here.

262
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:24,548
You knew he was missing
and you didn't tell us?

263
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:27,682
Tell Roche
Erik's a suspect.

264
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:29,379
He has his gun, too.

265
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:30,424
-LJ.
-LJ.

266
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:31,642
What?

267
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:32,861
I saw he had it with him
last night.

268
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:34,863
He has his gun?

269
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:37,387
There are no guns allowed
on the Snowpiercer.

270
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:40,521
Our security was allowedto
keep their sidearm.

271
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:45,134
The rest of us were disarmed
to keep you safe.

272
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:46,744
I'm gonna need to see
Erik's quarters.

273
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:49,095
This man is not
entering our carriage.

274
00:16:49,138 --> 00:16:50,748
Bringing this man
into First?

275
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:52,533
This is
unprecedented.

276
00:16:53,577 --> 00:16:54,883
On behalf of
everyone here,

277
00:16:54,926 --> 00:16:56,406
I demand to speak to
Mr. Wilford.

278
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,194
It's time, Melanie.

279
00:17:24,956 --> 00:17:26,480
This is Bennett.

280
00:17:26,523 --> 00:17:28,264
I'm sorry. I need you
to put me through to him.

281
00:17:28,308 --> 00:17:29,222
It's urgent.

282
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:31,746
Oh, hey,
are we doing this again?

283
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:34,140
Thank you. I'll wait.

284
00:17:34,183 --> 00:17:37,752
Anything to put a smile
on your face.

285
00:17:37,795 --> 00:17:38,970
Mr. Wilford.

286
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:40,233
Good news first...

287
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:42,670
We may have
identified the killer.

288
00:17:42,713 --> 00:17:43,975
Is that for real?

289
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:45,281
Or is that
part of the act?

290
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:48,937
Yeah, a bodyguard
from First.

291
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,765
But the family's reluctant

292
00:17:50,808 --> 00:17:52,723
to let your Detective in
to investigate,

293
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:54,203
and they would
like a word.

294
00:17:54,247 --> 00:17:57,511
Well, that would
piss me right off.

295
00:17:57,554 --> 00:17:58,773
Huff, huff, huff.

296
00:17:58,816 --> 00:18:01,167
The Folgers.

297
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,212
It's their man.

298
00:18:03,256 --> 00:18:05,867
Yes, Lilah Folger,
sir.

299
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,609
I know,
but she's demanding it.

300
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:14,093
Very good.

301
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,110
For the investigation,we will allow him in,

302
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:33,286
but only if
you accompany him.

303
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:41,381
Mr. Wilford,
my apologies.

304
00:18:41,424 --> 00:18:43,557
It seems
everything is sorted.

305
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,428
I miss you, Mel.

306
00:18:45,472 --> 00:18:47,430
Thank you for that.

307
00:18:47,474 --> 00:18:48,823
Goodbye, sir.

308
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:01,749
Can't back down from that.

309
00:20:08,642 --> 00:20:10,644
30 minutes.

310
00:20:16,302 --> 00:20:17,477
Here you go.

311
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,174
All the piss and shit
left in the world.

312
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,828
You get used to the smell.Quick, let's go.

313
00:20:20,871 --> 00:20:24,962
Just not the cholera.Cholera's not so bad.

314
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:26,137
Come on, quick, let's go.

315
00:20:26,181 --> 00:20:27,617
Before they get here.

316
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:29,184
Pass me that.

317
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,229
Pajamas?

318
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:31,142
Yeah, it's the middleof the night.

319
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:32,448
Kinda works, huh?

320
00:20:32,492 --> 00:20:33,797
It's fine.
Better hurry.

321
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:35,625
-Alright.
-Let's go. Hurry up.

322
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:38,802
Pass it to me.
There you go.

323
00:20:42,415 --> 00:20:44,373
Good luck.

324
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:04,872
Is he going to go through
all of ourthings?

325
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:06,177
Should we
offer him a drink?

326
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:08,310
No thanks, LJ.

327
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:12,923
He was 7th Marines.

328
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:14,185
Then he worked
private security.

329
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:15,361
What else can you
tell me about him?

330
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:17,188
We hired him
when the Freeze started

331
00:21:17,232 --> 00:21:19,234
to keep our family safe,
and he did.

332
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:23,760
And he saved my life.

333
00:21:23,804 --> 00:21:26,110
How'd he do that?

334
00:21:26,154 --> 00:21:28,287
That's not pertinent,LJ.

335
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:34,815
Anybody seen this before?

336
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:36,295
What is it?

337
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:37,687
It's a J-Hook.

338
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:40,211
Used for beekeeping.

339
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:46,000
What?
He showed it to me.

340
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:47,523
He said he found it.

341
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:49,699
Where?
I don't know.

342
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:51,571
Scrounging.

343
00:21:51,614 --> 00:21:53,529
The old Apiary?

344
00:21:53,573 --> 00:21:55,009
We used to keep bees

345
00:21:55,052 --> 00:21:57,359
until a colony collapse
three years ago.

346
00:21:57,403 --> 00:21:59,535
They crated up all the extra
hives and everything.

347
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:00,797
They're in storage.

348
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:02,886
Well, we need to find
which crate.

349
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,540
Can you send Till?

350
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:08,675
May I?

351
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,157
Lilah, let's us three
go into the other room.

352
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:16,378
We can position this in a
waythat's best for your family.

353
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:37,747
Brakeman Till.

354
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:49,411
Josie.

355
00:22:49,455 --> 00:22:50,630
Shh.

356
00:22:50,673 --> 00:22:53,763
How... How did...
Are you out of the Tail?

357
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:55,374
No questions, okay?
There's no time.

358
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:57,332
Are you still in
Food Processing?

359
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,290
Yeah, but I just cut
and load the bars.

360
00:22:59,334 --> 00:23:01,162
I don't have access to
ingredients or anything.

361
00:23:01,205 --> 00:23:03,469
That's not what we need.

362
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:11,433
Hey.

363
00:23:12,695 --> 00:23:14,393
Hey.

364
00:23:19,136 --> 00:23:20,442
Did you know
that Layton's out?

365
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:22,444
Yeah, they're using himas a detective.

366
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:24,664
There's a killer
loose up here.

367
00:23:24,707 --> 00:23:27,449
That's what it was.

368
00:23:27,493 --> 00:23:29,451
Okay, look.

369
00:23:29,495 --> 00:23:32,236
We need you tomake contact with him.

370
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,804
Josie,
if they catch me...

371
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:36,284
You could be sent backto the Tail.

372
00:23:36,327 --> 00:23:38,547
I know.

373
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:41,985
Honey, I get it.

374
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:44,118
You're healthy now.

375
00:23:44,161 --> 00:23:46,729
You live like
a human being.

376
00:23:46,773 --> 00:23:49,689
The Tail needs you.

377
00:23:53,649 --> 00:23:55,825
We need you.

378
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:01,701
One Tail.

379
00:24:01,744 --> 00:24:04,355
One Tail.

380
00:24:20,981 --> 00:24:23,374
Thank you.

381
00:24:27,683 --> 00:24:30,686
Looks like Erik wasn't born
intothe nice life he had up here.

382
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,689
Yeah, I don't think he had
a very good childhood.

383
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:37,345
You think he was capable of
something like this?

384
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,870
Maybe.

385
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:42,350
He surewasted those rioters

386
00:24:42,393 --> 00:24:44,613
who tried to grab meon
the way to Snowpiercer.

387
00:24:45,962 --> 00:24:48,051
Is that when
he saved your life?

388
00:24:48,095 --> 00:24:51,402
He joked about beingcold-blooded.

389
00:24:53,927 --> 00:24:55,929
Born for the Freeze.

390
00:24:57,365 --> 00:24:59,062
Even if this was Erik,
it's not our fault.

391
00:24:59,106 --> 00:25:00,368
Nobody's saying that.

392
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:02,196
Oh, I can just hear
the track talk.

393
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:03,458
Over the years,
we learned that

394
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,591
as a private soldier,
Erik did things.

395
00:25:05,634 --> 00:25:07,114
It's what he's for.

396
00:25:07,157 --> 00:25:09,072
Not psychotic murder.

397
00:25:09,116 --> 00:25:12,032
It can't come off likewe
have sheltered a monster.

398
00:25:14,469 --> 00:25:18,473
Did Erik ever get aggressive
or...weird with you?

399
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:27,351
You guys really not get to see
the sun in the Tail?

400
00:25:27,395 --> 00:25:31,442
Most of us haven't seen
the sunin seven years.

401
00:25:31,486 --> 00:25:33,053
How's that
make you feel,

402
00:25:33,096 --> 00:25:35,359
living up here witheverything you need?

403
00:25:35,403 --> 00:25:37,579
I mean, you guys didn't
have tickets.

404
00:25:42,018 --> 00:25:43,150
Watch this.

405
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:00,733
He asked aboutyour relationship with Erik.

406
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,956
What about it?

407
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,958
He tell you things?

408
00:26:09,002 --> 00:26:11,482
Ask you
to keep secrets?

409
00:26:26,454 --> 00:26:27,629
LJ?

410
00:26:31,154 --> 00:26:33,417
No, I-I better not
talk about it.

411
00:26:48,694 --> 00:26:50,652
Can we sit?

412
00:26:50,696 --> 00:26:52,872
I need to ask you
about Erik and LJ.

413
00:26:57,006 --> 00:26:59,661
We'll expect to hear from you,okay?

414
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:01,837
Bye.

415
00:27:01,881 --> 00:27:03,491
Yeah.

416
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,670
Miles...

417
00:27:09,715 --> 00:27:11,760
Oh, Christopher.

418
00:27:13,196 --> 00:27:16,156
Talk to Mom.
She'll understand.

419
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:20,029
Whatever.

420
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:25,339
Ah,
she's gonna be late.

421
00:27:25,382 --> 00:27:26,688
Mate, you're stressing me outdoing that.

422
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:33,042
Two minutes.

423
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:52,496
Oh, 'bout time.Yeah.

424
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,585
Santiago here's about
tohave a heart attack.

425
00:27:54,629 --> 00:27:56,239
We got to move.
Faster.

426
00:27:56,283 --> 00:27:57,240
Put this on.

427
00:27:57,284 --> 00:27:59,068
Okay.
Alright.

428
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:05,205
Three, two... There
you go....one.

429
00:28:07,773 --> 00:28:08,948
Back to work.

430
00:28:08,991 --> 00:28:11,602
Ooh.

431
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:15,650
Yeah, back to work.

432
00:28:28,532 --> 00:28:30,099
So, suddenly
we're searching for

433
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:32,014
a professional soldierwith a pistol?

434
00:28:32,058 --> 00:28:34,321
Revolver... .38.

435
00:28:34,364 --> 00:28:37,106
That's comforting,
thank you.

436
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,761
Hey,
you sure it's not above?

437
00:28:39,805 --> 00:28:42,155
No, it's on this level.

438
00:28:42,198 --> 00:28:44,157
Over here.

439
00:28:51,077 --> 00:28:52,731
Anybody in there?

440
00:28:56,822 --> 00:28:57,866
Open up.

441
00:29:07,702 --> 00:29:09,095
He's on the move!

442
00:29:09,138 --> 00:29:10,879
He's up top!

443
00:29:12,968 --> 00:29:14,013
Stop!

444
00:29:15,362 --> 00:29:16,624
Go, go, go, go!

445
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:17,886
Out of the way!

446
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,540
Osweiller, get him!

447
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:21,716
I'm going up!

448
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,196
He's going back down!
He's going to the stairs!

449
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:24,588
Okay! I'm on it.

450
00:29:24,632 --> 00:29:26,199
Move! Move!

451
00:29:28,505 --> 00:29:30,203
Oz!

452
00:29:30,246 --> 00:29:31,900
He's getting away!

453
00:29:31,944 --> 00:29:33,902
Go, go, go!

454
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:36,731
Shit!

455
00:29:37,993 --> 00:29:40,169
Erik was only allowed two bagson the train,

456
00:29:40,213 --> 00:29:42,389
and he brings records.

457
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,088
They were his dad's.

458
00:29:46,132 --> 00:29:48,961
He hated his dad.

459
00:29:49,004 --> 00:29:50,701
He was white.

460
00:29:50,745 --> 00:29:53,182
Yeah, no shit.

461
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,886
Yo.

462
00:30:03,105 --> 00:30:04,411
It's a cat.

463
00:30:04,454 --> 00:30:07,240
Yeah, yeah, I-I know.It's just...

464
00:30:07,283 --> 00:30:09,068
It's been a while.

465
00:30:09,111 --> 00:30:11,070
Erik saved him, too.

466
00:30:11,113 --> 00:30:13,986
Where'd he come from?

467
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:17,119
Snowpeter isa master of disguise.

468
00:30:17,163 --> 00:30:19,948
Snowpeter?

469
00:30:19,992 --> 00:30:21,820
That's funny.

470
00:30:52,502 --> 00:30:53,547
I hear
you eat people.

471
00:30:55,941 --> 00:30:58,117
We put a stop to that.

472
00:31:01,555 --> 00:31:04,819
It keeps everyone up here
scared of you.

473
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,561
Like, I'd eat a dude just to
make everyone shit bricks

474
00:31:07,604 --> 00:31:08,823
like they do
with the Tail.

475
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,004
I know this song.

476
00:31:17,832 --> 00:31:20,313
So did Nikki Genet.

477
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,056
you're a lot cooler
smashing the system

478
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:25,840
than you are
being Wilford's dick.

479
00:31:36,764 --> 00:31:41,421
Erik ever tell youwhat he did with this?

480
00:31:42,857 --> 00:31:43,814
Never.

481
00:31:43,858 --> 00:31:46,078
Erik practically
raised LJ.

482
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:47,166
It's going to come out,Lilah.

483
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:49,168
Zip it, Robert.We can't.

484
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:56,088
Erik and LJ
are close.

485
00:31:58,003 --> 00:32:00,005
"Close."

486
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:04,096
I can't say no to her.

487
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:06,402
It's these times.

488
00:32:06,446 --> 00:32:08,535
Morality's
a moving target.

489
00:32:16,195 --> 00:32:17,326
You open yet, Anton?

490
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:19,502
Come in, Jinju.
You made it.

491
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:21,374
I've got Bess' gift
right here.

492
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:40,959
Shh.

493
00:32:49,793 --> 00:32:51,752
Please...
Shut up. Shut up.

494
00:32:51,795 --> 00:32:53,406
A gun.

495
00:32:53,449 --> 00:32:54,755
An actual gun.

496
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:57,497
Keep quiet.

497
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,761
Or this artifact
will blow your head off.

498
00:33:00,804 --> 00:33:01,980
Okay.

499
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:04,025
Okay, we're...
we don't want any trouble.

500
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:05,548
Shh, shh, shh.

501
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:08,943
You know they hauled meup out of the Tail

502
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,598
to solve this against my will?

503
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:15,210
I got no skin
in this game.

504
00:33:15,254 --> 00:33:20,128
Erik might've been the murderer,but
removing body parts...

505
00:33:20,172 --> 00:33:21,912
that's how he screwed up.

506
00:33:21,956 --> 00:33:23,871
What do you mean
he screwed up?

507
00:33:23,914 --> 00:33:29,703
Well, castration's
a crime of passion.

508
00:33:29,746 --> 00:33:32,706
A punishment thatwomen lay down on men.

509
00:33:32,749 --> 00:33:35,448
That wasn't his idea,
was it?

510
00:33:35,491 --> 00:33:37,580
He's probably justcontrolling the victim

511
00:33:37,624 --> 00:33:39,452
for somebody else,
right?

512
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:45,936
So, are we
playing your song?

513
00:33:59,124 --> 00:34:01,648
Shit, if I wasa blue-eyed Firstie girl,

514
00:34:01,691 --> 00:34:03,345
I'd be playing for time,
too.

515
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:06,914
Erik's going downin a
blaze of glory, right?

516
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,657
He's not going to
The Drawers.

517
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,573
So, no one tells.

518
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:18,795
And you finallygot to feel something.

519
00:34:21,537 --> 00:34:24,453
When he held those men downfor you.

520
00:34:44,038 --> 00:34:47,215
Chop, chop.

521
00:34:47,259 --> 00:34:49,261
Say you were
even 2% right.

522
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:53,569
Tailies need stuff.

523
00:34:53,613 --> 00:34:56,006
Always scrounging.

524
00:34:57,443 --> 00:35:00,054
Bet you'd like blueprints.

525
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,056
How about guns?

526
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,059
Only First Class securitygets those.

527
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,149
Wow.

528
00:35:08,193 --> 00:35:10,673
You really are serious.

529
00:35:10,717 --> 00:35:14,721
But I bet
a blue-eyed Firstie girl

530
00:35:14,764 --> 00:35:18,899
might be able to get her hands
on one of those.

531
00:35:21,423 --> 00:35:24,078
And all I got to do
is tell nobody?

532
00:35:37,483 --> 00:35:40,094
He's somewhere in here.
We got jackboots on the door.

533
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,097
Alright, folks, we're extending
lockdown right now.

534
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,185
She said
this was coming.

535
00:35:44,229 --> 00:35:46,187
Who?

536
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:49,190
Your girl?

537
00:35:52,759 --> 00:35:54,413
Alright, folks, listen up.

538
00:35:54,456 --> 00:35:57,242
Just do what I say...
Get down. Now.

539
00:35:57,285 --> 00:35:59,331
Chip in. Chip in.

540
00:36:08,253 --> 00:36:09,471
Move!

541
00:36:18,654 --> 00:36:20,221
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

542
00:36:20,265 --> 00:36:23,355
Down.
Down, go!

543
00:36:28,055 --> 00:36:29,274
There's the suspect!

544
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:33,669
He's down below,
one hostage.

545
00:36:33,713 --> 00:36:36,629
Push down towards us.

546
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:38,239
Go. Go.

547
00:36:38,283 --> 00:36:39,327
Just tell me your name.

548
00:36:39,371 --> 00:36:41,982
Does that matter?

549
00:36:47,509 --> 00:36:49,946
Please.

550
00:36:51,165 --> 00:36:53,254
They're coming.

551
00:36:53,298 --> 00:36:55,256
Alright, flank.

552
00:37:00,305 --> 00:37:03,482
Turn around.

553
00:37:03,525 --> 00:37:05,005
Turn around!
Ohh.

554
00:37:05,048 --> 00:37:06,572
Kneel down.

555
00:37:06,615 --> 00:37:08,226
Forward!

556
00:37:09,401 --> 00:37:10,663
No, no!
We have... We have to hold!

557
00:37:10,706 --> 00:37:12,273
Hey, pull back.
He'll shoot her.

558
00:37:12,317 --> 00:37:13,927
Batons down!

559
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:16,364
Weapons on the deck,
now!

560
00:37:31,684 --> 00:37:33,512
Advance!

561
00:37:57,927 --> 00:38:01,453
Get me Melanie Cavill.
It's urgent.

562
00:38:20,385 --> 00:38:22,256
He's dead.

563
00:38:26,782 --> 00:38:29,611
Erik's dead?

564
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:34,355
I got you, baby.
I got you.

565
00:38:36,357 --> 00:38:38,446
Oh, sweetie.

566
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:44,539
I got you.
It's okay.

567
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:46,585
Honey.
Shh.

568
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,284
Oh, honey.

569
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,461
Shh.
I got you.

570
00:38:53,505 --> 00:38:56,943
Oh, honey.

571
00:38:56,986 --> 00:38:58,118
Ohh.

572
00:38:58,161 --> 00:38:59,946
It's okay.

573
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:02,688
Shh.

574
00:39:20,532 --> 00:39:23,099
What's happening?

575
00:39:24,318 --> 00:39:27,190
Erik was a dog
who did what he was told.

576
00:39:27,234 --> 00:39:29,671
And Lilah Junior
told him to torture

577
00:39:29,715 --> 00:39:32,413
and kill
two Third Class men.

578
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,024
What?

579
00:39:35,068 --> 00:39:36,112
Your daughter's
a murderer.

580
00:39:36,156 --> 00:39:38,463
-How dare you!
-What?!

581
00:39:39,681 --> 00:39:40,813
No, no, LJ, no.

582
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,425
LJ, stop it!

583
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:46,166
No!

584
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,430
No!

585
00:39:50,649 --> 00:39:53,303
No! No!
No! No! No!

586
00:39:53,347 --> 00:39:54,522
Leave my baby alone!

587
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:56,437
You get off of her
right now!

588
00:40:15,282 --> 00:40:17,284
Attention all passengers.

589
00:40:17,327 --> 00:40:20,722
On behalf of Mr. Wilford,

590
00:40:20,766 --> 00:40:23,377
I share this news...

591
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,554
the murderer
who hid among us is dead,

592
00:40:26,598 --> 00:40:30,906
and a second suspect
is in custody.

593
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:34,562
Thanks to
a successful investigation,

594
00:40:34,606 --> 00:40:37,260
order has been restored,

595
00:40:37,304 --> 00:40:42,918
and Mr. Wilford assures you
justice will prevail.

596
00:40:42,962 --> 00:40:48,271
From all of us at
Wilford Industries, thank you.

597
00:40:57,759 --> 00:41:00,588
Now Mr. Wilford has todeliver justice.

598
00:41:02,024 --> 00:41:04,374
You in charge of that promise,too?

599
00:41:08,553 --> 00:41:11,120
How about I buy you a drink,
Detective?

600
00:41:16,778 --> 00:41:18,301
Beautiful, isn't it?

601
00:41:18,345 --> 00:41:19,781
Yeah.

602
00:41:19,825 --> 00:41:22,480
A monument to human dominion
and resource control.

603
00:41:23,524 --> 00:41:25,047
Come on.

604
00:41:25,091 --> 00:41:27,615
Let's put the politics down
and celebrate a win.

605
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:46,199
Oh, shit. Sake.Mm-hmm.

606
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:55,730
What do you think Mr. Wilford's
big secret even was?

607
00:41:57,776 --> 00:42:01,127
I just want to go backto the Tail, Melanie.

608
00:42:02,084 --> 00:42:04,826
You know I can't
let you do that.

609
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:07,089
You've seen too much.

610
00:42:12,225 --> 00:42:14,619
You figured it out,
Layton.

611
00:42:16,446 --> 00:42:18,274
I know you did.

612
00:42:21,321 --> 00:42:23,584
A myth's a powerful thing.

613
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:30,373
Pray you never
know the weight of it.

614
00:42:46,651 --> 00:42:48,566
I'm sorry, Layton.

615
00:43:05,931 --> 00:43:08,673
-Thank you.
-Keep warm, brother.

616
00:43:11,632 --> 00:43:13,460
Hang on.
Hang on, mate.

617
00:43:13,503 --> 00:43:15,897
Okay, nothing there.

618
00:43:15,941 --> 00:43:18,247
There you go,
mate.

619
00:43:19,684 --> 00:43:20,859
Yoshimi.

620
00:43:20,902 --> 00:43:23,122
You're looking stunningas always.

621
00:43:25,907 --> 00:43:27,387
Oh, what the...

622
00:43:40,139 --> 00:43:41,619
Yes.

623
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:44,534
Take over.

624
00:43:44,578 --> 00:43:46,014
-What's he doing?
-Hey, Josie!

625
00:43:46,058 --> 00:43:48,190
Where do you think you're
going?Coming through, guys.

626
00:43:48,234 --> 00:43:50,323
Mind your head.
Excuse me!

627
00:43:50,366 --> 00:43:51,977
What is it?

628
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,718
Looks like
Astrid came through.

629
00:43:55,545 --> 00:43:57,504
-Yes.
-Yeah.

630
00:44:18,612 --> 00:44:21,180
Keep him off-book.

631
00:44:21,223 --> 00:44:24,313
And, Doctor,

632
00:44:24,357 --> 00:44:27,621
Mr. Wilford does not
want him damaged.

632
00:44:28,305 --> 00:45:28,772

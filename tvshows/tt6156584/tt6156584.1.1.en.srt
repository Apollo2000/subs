1
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,141
First, the weather changed.

2
00:00:11,185 --> 00:00:12,534
The deniers knew why,

3
00:00:12,577 --> 00:00:15,798
but still they doomed us
with their lies.

4
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:18,540
War made the Earth even hotter.

5
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:23,023
Her ice melted,
and all her species crashed.

6
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:26,026
So, the men of Science
tried to cool the Earth,

7
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:29,464
to reverse the damage
they had sown.

8
00:00:29,507 --> 00:00:31,379
But instead,

9
00:00:31,422 --> 00:00:35,818
they froze her to the core.

10
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:42,216
Only the visionary Mr. Wilford
foresaw the future,

11
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:45,001
and he prepared
a Great Ark train.

12
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:49,614
In the final days
of The Freeze,

13
00:00:49,658 --> 00:00:52,443
the rich,
many of them responsible,

14
00:00:52,487 --> 00:00:57,187
retreated to Snowpiercer,
1,001 cars long.

15
00:00:59,842 --> 00:01:03,019
So we the people,
the survivors left behind...

16
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:06,805
...we invaded their train.

17

18
00:01:25,302 --> 00:01:26,671
All aboard.

19
00:01:26,695 --> 00:01:28,871
All ticketed passengers
please board.

20
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:32,875
Snowpiercer departs
at precisely 0:00 hours.

21
00:01:32,918 --> 00:01:35,660
Come on, Miles.

22
00:01:35,704 --> 00:01:37,053
Mike?

23
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,446
Train departs in 10, 9...

24
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:39,664
Mike!

25
00:01:40,448 --> 00:01:43,494
8, 7, 6,

26
00:01:43,538 --> 00:01:47,107
5, 4, 3,

27
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,891
2, 1.

28
00:01:48,934 --> 00:01:50,284
Departure.

29
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:57,247
Back 'em up!
That's it!

30
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:58,988
Back 'em up!

31
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:00,772
Throw them off the train!

32
00:02:00,816 --> 00:02:02,731
- Go back. Go back.
- Alright.

33
00:02:02,774 --> 00:02:04,472
Go to the back.

34
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:08,867
Back, love.

35
00:02:10,086 --> 00:02:11,696
Miles, this way, go.

36
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,915
You're gonna have to hide.

37
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:17,180
It's going to be okay.

38
00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:18,288
You need you to hide,
okay, honey?

39
00:02:18,312 --> 00:02:19,487
Get in there!

40
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,141
Please, don't come out!

41
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:23,099
It's gonna be okay!
It's gonna be alright.

42
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,709
Come here!

43
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,767
Contain the bastards!

44
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:42,466
Close the door!

45
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,772
Don't let them
close it!

46
00:02:50,735 --> 00:02:54,043
This is Snowpiercer.

47
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:56,306
Around and around the Earth
we circle.

48
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,003
We can never stop.

49
00:02:58,047 --> 00:03:02,921
These are our revolutions,
1,001 cars long.

50
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,365
Attention all passengers...

51
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:58,586
Wilford Industries
wishes you good morning.

52
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:04,374
The temperature outside is minus-119.6 degrees Celsius.

53
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:08,117
As we enter the Yukon Territory
of the former Canada,

54
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,033
we remind you,
for your personal safety...

55
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:13,992
be prepared to brace.

56
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:17,866
We are 6 years, 9 months,
and 26 days

57
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:20,216
from departure.

58
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,871
At the tone,
the exact time will be

59
00:04:22,914 --> 00:04:25,308
0800 hours.

60
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,316
Step back!
Move back!

61
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,883
Down in front!
Hit the floor!

62
00:04:34,926 --> 00:04:36,121
Down on the floor!

63
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:46,416
- Both gates open.
- Hey.

64
00:04:49,114 --> 00:04:50,333
- Hey!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

65
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:54,598
Hey, hey, hey!

66
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:56,426
Sit down and calm down!

67
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,646
- Where's the other cart?
- That's it for today.

68
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:00,319
What? Yeah. You better
get used to it.

69
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:01,494
- Half rations?
- Wait! Don't talk back.

70
00:05:01,518 --> 00:05:04,652
You can't do this!
We're starving as it is.

71
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:07,611
We have children back here!
How can we live?!

72
00:05:09,657 --> 00:05:12,355
I'm sick of this, man.
Bullshit!

73
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,115
We'll do the
best with what we've got, all right?

74
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:15,421
Mama Grande, you want
to take care of the food?

75
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:22,234
Okay. Take another deep breath,
Big John.

76
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:29,329
Okay.

77
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:31,331
On to death and taxes,
everyone.

78
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:33,376
We need 1/10th
from everyone.

79
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,336
Five to feed the rats
and five to feed Strong Boy.

80
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:37,685
He's fit for us all, eh?

81
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:39,077
Take your time on that today,
hey?

82
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:40,841
- Come on.
- I saw you smash that yesterday.

83
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:43,517
You need it
more than me.

84
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,954
Thanks, Josie. It's all right.

85
00:05:48,217 --> 00:05:50,915
Hey, hey, hey!
Give it back!

86
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:53,309
- No, no, come on. Get back.
- No, no! Mine!

87
00:05:55,703 --> 00:05:57,357
You gotta go get
the rat rations.

88
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,184
I will.

89
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:01,361
Gina only had four pups
this time.

90
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:02,927
Well, what's our surplus?

91
00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:04,189
Uh, 42.

92
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:06,191
Hey. Not bad.

93
00:06:06,235 --> 00:06:08,716
All right. What else?

94
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,587
What's Old Ivan
got you doing?

95
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:13,198
Sines, cosines,
and tangents.

96
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:16,071
Trigonometry...
all right.

97
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:18,474
Those kind of skills will get
you apprenticed up outta here.

98
00:06:20,771 --> 00:06:22,773
You really think
I can be an engineer?

99
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:24,949
Hey.

100
00:06:24,993 --> 00:06:26,647
I know you can.

101
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:30,085
Come on, Layton,
let's get this done.

102
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:32,217
You're a good man, Miles.

103
00:06:32,261 --> 00:06:34,219
Never forget who you are.

104
00:06:34,263 --> 00:06:35,743
A Tailie.

105
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,096
Right here.

106
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:42,837
We take this car,

107
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,684
and we can have access
to the electrical junctions.

108
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,338
Now, Lights says
we can back-surge from there,

109
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:48,016
cutting power to Ag-Sec.

110
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:51,802
Layton,
how are our Jackboots?

111
00:06:51,846 --> 00:06:53,543
They're getting sloppy.

112
00:06:53,587 --> 00:06:55,173
Leaving both gates open
for up to a minute ten.

113
00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:56,372
Okay.

114
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,200
Strong Boy's ready to go.

115
00:06:58,243 --> 00:07:00,463
We got one minute ten
to get to the next car.

116
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:02,291
We only gotta take four

117
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:04,467
to access
the electrical junction.

118
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:07,862
Yeah, but we might not take out
any essential systems at all.

119
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:10,604
We just don't know enough
about the infrastructure.

120
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:12,867
We know, what,
maybe a dozen cars...

121
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,696
a few back here by us,
a few more up around Sanitation.

122
00:07:15,739 --> 00:07:18,742
The only Tailie who has ever
been north of the Nightcar

123
00:07:18,786 --> 00:07:20,265
is Old Ivan here.

124
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:22,877
I will never be too old
to remember the day

125
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,836
they pulled me uptrain
to tune a piano.

126
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,013
It played beautifully
except for one dead key...

127
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:30,667
middle C.

128
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:32,669
I guess no one remembered
to bring some...

129
00:07:32,713 --> 00:07:34,279
Bring piano wire.
Yeah.

130
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:35,866
With all due respect,
we heard it before,

131
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,457
and this doesn't exactly
fill the belly.

132
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,632
Pike's right.

133
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:39,894
If we don't do something soon,

134
00:07:39,937 --> 00:07:41,635
it's gonna be too late.

135
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:44,768
They just cut our rations
again. No doubt.

136
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:46,137
It's like slavery's
the only reason

137
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:47,510
they still feeding us
at all.

138
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:48,574
They're starving us
to extinction.

139
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:50,731
They're sterilizing
our women.

140
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:52,535
There hasn't been a child born
in the Tail in five years!

141
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:53,298
I say we fight!

142
00:07:53,342 --> 00:07:54,778
I want to be a Dad!

143
00:07:54,822 --> 00:07:57,433
Guys,
I'm the Last Australian.

144
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:01,698
Before long, they are gonna
cut our food for good.

145
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:04,353
We have informants in half a
dozen different sectors, okay?

146
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:05,441
We are building
networks.

147
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,617
Layton, there is no time
for that now.

148
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:09,837
You all remember
the Year Three Rebellion?

149
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,578
We fought like an army,

150
00:08:11,621 --> 00:08:14,450
but we were blind
at every door.

151
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,408
We had no help
from the other side.

152
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:18,280
62 dead.

153
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:22,937
13 arms
taken in punishment.

154
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:26,114
We need help.

155
00:08:26,157 --> 00:08:27,550
We need alliances.

156
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:30,379
You know what I think,
Layton?

157
00:08:30,422 --> 00:08:33,948
I think you don't got the guts
to stand with us.

158
00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:36,559
Pike, you can question my plan
if you want.

159
00:08:36,603 --> 00:08:39,475
You question my fight,
and we got a serious problem.

160
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:44,045
Oh, there's no problem.

161
00:08:44,088 --> 00:08:45,655
For One Tail.

162
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:48,266
Hey, we are One Tail.

163
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,572
We're at
the end of our rope.

164
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:51,748
That's right.
So we got no choice.

165
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:54,359
We do this now
before they toss us again

166
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:55,535
and find the weapons.

167
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:57,580
- That's right!
- That's right!

168
00:08:57,624 --> 00:08:59,451
- One Tail, Layton.
- One Tail.

169
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:00,627
- One Tail, man.
- One Tail.

170
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,150
- One Tail.
- One Tail.

171
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:03,586
- One Tail.
- One Tail.

172
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,935
One Tail.

173
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:13,596
One Tail.

174
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:31,701
Layton.

175
00:09:31,745 --> 00:09:33,137
Look, uh...

176
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:34,965
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:37,011
I know you want
to move things slower, but...

178
00:09:37,054 --> 00:09:39,013
We need to think long-term
about this.

179
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:41,406
There is no long-term if we're
too old and sick to fight.

180
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:46,150
I don't want you
on the front line tomorrow.

181
00:09:46,194 --> 00:09:47,543
We're gonna be all right.

182
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,570
Heavenly father,
we come to you in a time of need

183
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,442
because we need you now
more than ever.

184
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:19,749
We ask for your
divine protection.

185
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:21,316
Amen.

186
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:50,084
Here.

187
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:53,435
You will do better with this
than me.

188
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:57,482
Resistance is never futile,

189
00:10:57,526 --> 00:11:00,398
but Wilford's train

190
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:04,489
is a fortress to class.

191
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:09,799
Maybe it is perpetual.

192
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:12,715
I know
you don't believe that.

193
00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:25,249
Good luck, my boy.

194
00:11:25,293 --> 00:11:27,077
Good luck, Ivan.

195
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:49,752
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

196
00:11:49,796 --> 00:11:52,494
Good morning.
Good morning.

197
00:11:56,193 --> 00:11:58,152
Good morning.
How are you today?

198
00:11:58,195 --> 00:12:00,154
Delightful.
Thank you for asking.

199
00:12:00,197 --> 00:12:01,522
Good morning, Martin. Good morning.

200
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:02,785
Come on, guys. Good morning, Mr. Lam.

201
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:03,766
Jóusàhn, Melanie.

202
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:09,380
- My congee was quite good.
- Oh, no.

203
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:11,054
You're not allowed to have
better Cantonese than me.

204
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:12,775
Oh, no, I don't.

205
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:15,125
Let's go. Come on.
We're gonna be late again.

206
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:16,233
- Good morning, Folgers.
- Mm-hmm.

207
00:12:16,257 --> 00:12:17,780
Ruth.

208
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:19,347
Uh, some concerns
about the sauna.

209
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,305
Oh, no.

210
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:23,046
I'll send maintenance
right away.

211
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,874
No, it's not broken.

212
00:12:24,918 --> 00:12:27,181
The Europeans
are body shaming again.

213
00:12:27,224 --> 00:12:28,835
Americans
and the rest of the world

214
00:12:28,878 --> 00:12:30,401
prefer bathing attire.

215
00:12:30,445 --> 00:12:32,882
It's just easier.

216
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:35,189
The Scandinavian Royals
take great pleasure

217
00:12:35,232 --> 00:12:36,581
in defying the rules.

218
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,410
And they sing
sauna songs.

219
00:12:39,454 --> 00:12:41,804
I sauna to relax.

220
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:44,198
I'm sure there's
a scheduling solution.

221
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:45,784
We can look at it
next Committee meeting.

222
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:47,244
Perfect.

223
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:48,724
Thank you.

224
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,291
How's your parfait, LJ?

225
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:53,337
I want to go to Third Class
for noodles again today.

226
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:54,924
Oh, you better not
go to Third now.

227
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:56,601
There's more violence,
I heard.

228
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:57,970
Oh, well, that's nothing
but track talk.

229
00:12:57,994 --> 00:12:59,667
Melanie,
what's going on down there?

230
00:12:59,691 --> 00:13:00,886
The Brakemen
responded to something.

231
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,825
That's all we know
at this point.

232
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:04,784
Probably just Third
settling scores.

233
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:07,003
We'll update you
as soon as possible.

234
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:14,924
York... just had
to open his mouth.

235
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:16,839
All right, well,
bad news travels fast.

236
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:18,145
You better
get down there.

237
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:21,844
I was hoping to avoid
the Tail this week.

238
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:23,585
Oh, come on.

239
00:13:23,628 --> 00:13:27,545
You know you love an excuse
to wear your fur.

240
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:52,962
Two Brakemen,
six Jackboots.

241
00:13:56,183 --> 00:13:58,663
Hospitality
and six more Jacks.

242
00:13:58,707 --> 00:13:59,969
Hospitality?

243
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:01,449
What do they want? Don't know.

244
00:14:01,492 --> 00:14:02,580
Do we abort?

245
00:14:02,624 --> 00:14:03,581
Hold for the signal.

246
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:12,242
Step back!
Hit the floor!

247
00:14:28,998 --> 00:14:30,347
Good morning.

248
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:36,614
Mr. Wilford and all of us
here at Wilford Industries

249
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:38,921
bid you good morning.

250
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:40,270
As I just said, before...

251
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:41,881
Sorry.
I'm... I'm sorry.

252
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:48,235
We have a Removal Request.

253
00:14:49,627 --> 00:14:51,412
Mr. Andre Layton.

254
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,069
Please make yourself known.

255
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:00,073
Hold.

256
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:05,121
Hold.

257
00:15:06,775 --> 00:15:08,255
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

258
00:15:08,298 --> 00:15:09,778
It's all right.
No, no, no!

259
00:15:11,388 --> 00:15:12,824
Settle down!

260
00:15:16,219 --> 00:15:18,961
- What do you want with me?!
- Stop, stop!

261
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:19,919
What do you want?!

262
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:21,877
Layton! Layton!

263
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,010
Take me back!
Take me back!

264
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:26,664
No!

265
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:27,927
Take me back!

266
00:15:34,107 --> 00:15:35,467
Here we go, little guy.

267
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,549
Ahh.

268
00:15:45,335 --> 00:15:46,335
Open.

269
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,078
Good boy.

270
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:10,926
Hey, what do you
want me for?

271
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,797
Till, right?
What's going on?

272
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:16,627
Shut your Tailie mouth and keep walking.

273
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,817
Come on.

274
00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:00,644
- Where are we?
- Third Class Mess Hall.

275
00:18:02,777 --> 00:18:06,520
Mr. Layton,
I'm Lead Brakemen Roche.

276
00:19:04,317 --> 00:19:05,381
We've heard that,
in the Old Life,

277
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:06,884
you were
a homicide detective.

278
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,279
We've had a murder.

279
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:14,065
Aren't you cops?

280
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:15,676
Most of us
were Wilford Security.

281
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:17,678
Some were...

282
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:18,679
soccer players?

283
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:20,724
Midfielder.

284
00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:26,861
I guess Mr. Wilford
didn't think rich people

285
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:28,167
would murder each other.

286
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:31,518
You were a cop, though.

287
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,695
Detroit P.D.

288
00:19:34,738 --> 00:19:37,524
I'm sorry.

289
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:39,526
Heard it got rough
out there.

290
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:41,049
The department
turned on itself.

291
00:19:41,092 --> 00:19:42,532
It was rough everywhere.

292
00:19:44,531 --> 00:19:46,924
Hey, you got another bowl?
- No.

293
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:48,926
We've got a body.

294
00:19:58,632 --> 00:20:01,112
You okay?

295
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:03,593
Hey.

296
00:20:04,638 --> 00:20:07,771
I packed his worldly possessions
so no one steals them.

297
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:10,948
His "worldly possessions."

298
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:21,350
Climbing up into the mountains
again, aren't we?

299
00:20:21,394 --> 00:20:23,961
The Cascades.

300
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:27,791
It's a rough track.Yeah.

301
00:20:27,835 --> 00:20:30,533
Now I have to get
that apprenticeship.

302
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:32,318
Nah.

303
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:33,971
I think we need you
here in the Tail.

304
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:35,973
You're our Miles and Miles.

305
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:37,584
People don't come back,
Mum.

306
00:20:37,627 --> 00:20:40,195
Somebody
has to go find Layton.

307
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,110
Layton will be okay.

308
00:20:42,153 --> 00:20:44,373
If anyone can get back to us,
it's him.

309
00:20:57,604 --> 00:21:00,302
Y'all got some
serious problems up here.

310
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:03,262
So, I think they cut him up
into pieces to hide him better.

311
00:21:07,614 --> 00:21:09,224
That's my theory.

312
00:21:10,878 --> 00:21:12,314
Sean Oren Wise.

313
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:14,229
Third Class,
worked in Agriculture.

314
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,404
Who found him?

315
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:17,624
A Tunnelman,
doing maintenance.

316
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,843
What do y'all have up here
in the way of forensics?

317
00:21:19,887 --> 00:21:21,410
No real crime lab
or anything,

318
00:21:21,454 --> 00:21:23,282
but we have access
to some scientists.

319
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:27,024
What about his, uh...
his dick?

320
00:21:29,462 --> 00:21:31,202
The Freeze cut your career short
at what?

321
00:21:31,246 --> 00:21:34,075
First year rook?

322
00:21:34,118 --> 00:21:35,772
I wanted
to make Homicide.

323
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:37,034
Yeah?

324
00:21:37,078 --> 00:21:38,732
Well, you made Brakeman,

325
00:21:38,775 --> 00:21:40,275
so you can figure this out
for yourself.

326
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,039
Take me back to the Tail.Hey.

327
00:21:44,128 --> 00:21:45,608
This is your chance,
mate.

328
00:21:45,652 --> 00:21:46,957
Take it.

329
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:49,090
Why would you want
to go back there?

330
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:51,353
So they know
I'm not a traitor.

331
00:21:51,397 --> 00:21:54,878
They'll slit your throat now,
man.

332
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,620
Clean up your own shit.

333
00:21:59,796 --> 00:22:01,450
Oi, I got one for ya.

334
00:22:01,494 --> 00:22:03,539
What do coppers
and football players

335
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,280
have in common?

336
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,456
You mean soccer players?

337
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,893
Nothing. No, no.
Come on, Detective.

338
00:22:09,937 --> 00:22:14,028
Cops and footie...
what's in common?

339
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:20,643
A good... stiff... boot!

340
00:22:20,687 --> 00:22:23,472
All right, hey.
Osweiller, that's enough.

341
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:25,431
Penalty kick!

342
00:22:25,474 --> 00:22:26,693
What the hell is this?!

343
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:30,697
He was getting
mouthy with us, sir.

344
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,655
Sorry, sir.
The Tailie's uncooperative,

345
00:22:32,699 --> 00:22:34,701
says he won't help
with the investigation.

346
00:22:34,744 --> 00:22:36,243
Oh, and you thought a beating
would convince him?

347
00:22:36,267 --> 00:22:37,878
I think your partner
has some issues.

348
00:22:37,921 --> 00:22:39,662
You two idiots,
step out.

349
00:22:39,706 --> 00:22:40,924
Now.

350
00:22:43,623 --> 00:22:46,103
You go back to
your doghouse in the Tail.

351
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:47,322
Double shift.

352
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,193
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

353
00:22:53,284 --> 00:22:54,895
All right,
you pain in the ass.

354
00:22:54,938 --> 00:22:56,331
Aah!

355
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,507
This is Melanie,
from Hospitality.

356
00:22:58,551 --> 00:23:01,336
My apologies, Detective,

357
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,165
on behalf
of Wilford Industries.

358
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:07,211
You're the Voice
of the Train.

359
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,476
I am. I am.

360
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:12,391
I wear several hats.

361
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:14,915
My department's responsible
for smooth relations.

362
00:23:17,744 --> 00:23:18,788
Mm.

363
00:23:21,922 --> 00:23:24,838
Detective...

364
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:28,755
I'm here
to tell you personally

365
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:31,366
that Mr. Wilford wants this
solved quickly.

366
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,543
Doors will open wherever
your investigation leads you.

367
00:23:38,155 --> 00:23:40,201
Ah, shit.

368
00:23:40,244 --> 00:23:41,787
Two years ago,
there was another victim...

369
00:23:41,811 --> 00:23:44,423
male, genitals removed.

370
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:47,469
Someone's already serving time
in The Drawers for it.

371
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:52,387
So... either you got
a copycat...

372
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,650
or Mr. Wilford
put the wrong person

373
00:23:54,694 --> 00:23:55,782
in the Drawers.

374
00:23:58,262 --> 00:23:59,699
I'll do it for rations

375
00:23:59,742 --> 00:24:01,024
and Third Class immigration
for the Tail.

376
00:24:01,048 --> 00:24:03,006
You're not entitled
to anything here!

377
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,660
The passengers had tickets,

378
00:24:04,704 --> 00:24:06,575
all the crew had jobs. Lead Brakeman.

379
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:08,577
You Tailies boarded the train
like rats!

380
00:24:08,621 --> 00:24:10,274
Lead Brakeman, please!

381
00:24:10,318 --> 00:24:11,537
Would you uncuff him?

382
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:16,846
Please.

383
00:24:18,848 --> 00:24:22,417
This must be
very disconcerting to you.

384
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,027
Really, it's simple.

385
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:27,030
You are the only
homicide detective on the train.

386
00:24:27,074 --> 00:24:31,339
And so, Mr. Wilford
is asking you to contribute.

387
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,514
Doctor.

388
00:25:16,776 --> 00:25:19,430
These are the Drawers,
Detective Layton.

389
00:25:22,695 --> 00:25:26,525
And this Nikki Genet,
sentenced for murder.

390
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:29,223
She's innocent,
isn't she?

391
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:31,051
Why you say that?

392
00:25:31,094 --> 00:25:32,487
She just looks it.

393
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,055
I've taken
special care of her.

394
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:36,665
She would be
the longest Sleeper

395
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:38,711
we've ever brought
out of suspension...

396
00:25:38,754 --> 00:25:40,539
over two years under.

397
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:42,299
And she's our only
witness to the first murder.

398
00:25:42,323 --> 00:25:45,456
You want justice, Detective,
clear her.

399
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,676
And if you catch the killer,

400
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,070
we'll make you Train Detective
and move you to Third Class.

401
00:25:50,113 --> 00:25:52,333
Um, they take a while
to recover,

402
00:25:52,376 --> 00:25:54,857
and I really need
The Notary present...

403
00:25:54,901 --> 00:25:55,901
Let's make it happen.

404
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,034
Yep.

405
00:26:02,343 --> 00:26:04,563
I'm not agreeing to anything.

406
00:26:06,956 --> 00:26:09,698
Well, I'm gonna leave you
in Mr. Roche's hands for now.

407
00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:11,874
He'll take you
to the suspects.

408
00:26:18,185 --> 00:26:20,404
Sean Wise's roommates
reported him missing

409
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:23,538
24 hours
before he was found.

410
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,776
Welcome to The Chains,
Tail-man.

411
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,410
"The Chains"?

412
00:26:26,454 --> 00:26:28,108
Yeah. It's a thing now.

413
00:26:28,151 --> 00:26:29,631
Young people mostly,

414
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:32,678
living and screwing in groups...
"Chains".

415
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:35,419
They took some
chopped-up containers,

416
00:26:35,463 --> 00:26:37,334
got creative with them.

417
00:26:37,378 --> 00:26:39,772
Bunch of freaks,
if you ask me.

418
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:41,643
My wife also has
some choice descriptors,

419
00:26:41,687 --> 00:26:43,993
but I think
you're gonna love 'em.

420
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:47,257
Here's Sean Wise's partners,
waiting for you.

421
00:26:47,301 --> 00:26:49,608
I believe one of them you've
already met.

422
00:26:55,004 --> 00:26:57,441
Tomato soup
and a grilled cheese.

423
00:26:57,485 --> 00:27:00,749
Hello, Zarah. Hi, Andre.

424
00:27:00,793 --> 00:27:05,972
Get these two out of here,
I'll start with her.

425
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:07,602
You'll be fine, we haven't done
anything wrong.

426
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,604
You're not a Tailie, don't let
'em treat you like one.

427
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,238
Don't worry, okay?

428
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:13,588
I'll be good. Get out.

429
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,634
Come on, let's go.
Come on.

430
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:21,030
Uncuff her, give us
a minute alone.

431
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:22,641
Yeah, buddy,
this isn't a conjugal.

432
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:24,817
It sure isn't.It's motivation.

433
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,776
You need to do your new job
like Mr. Wilford wants.

434
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,560
prove it isn't her.

435
00:27:29,604 --> 00:27:31,171
It's been five years...

436
00:27:31,214 --> 00:27:33,956
give us a minute alone or this
is as far as I go.

437
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,531
Well...

438
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:50,190
Maybe you two
can patch things up.

439
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:52,888
The room is yours,
Detective.

440
00:27:56,936 --> 00:27:58,459
You told them I was a cop?!

441
00:27:58,502 --> 00:28:00,026
Someone I love
was murdered.

442
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:01,917
You were the only person
I could think of to help.

443
00:28:01,941 --> 00:28:03,638
It's just like
the Tail up here...

444
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,248
there is no process,
just punishment.

445
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:08,643
They could pin Sean's murder
on one of us.

446
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,384
Jesus, they might never
let me go back.

447
00:28:10,427 --> 00:28:12,212
Good.

448
00:28:12,255 --> 00:28:13,735
You're out.

449
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:15,234
Isn't that what you wanted
for your revolution?

450
00:28:15,258 --> 00:28:17,304
Hey. Shh!

451
00:28:17,347 --> 00:28:19,698
I didn't choose
to leave like you.

452
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:21,700
Turned your back on us

453
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:25,225
so you could go work
in the Nightcar.

454
00:28:25,268 --> 00:28:26,530
You forced all this
on us.

455
00:28:26,574 --> 00:28:27,793
Zarah...

456
00:28:27,836 --> 00:28:29,031
It was 40 degrees below
in June

457
00:28:29,055 --> 00:28:30,447
and still
dropping like a stone.

458
00:28:30,491 --> 00:28:32,449
Yeah, I remember.
You wanted to die!

459
00:28:32,493 --> 00:28:33,842
You said don't give up.

460
00:28:33,886 --> 00:28:35,365
You could get us
onto Snowpiercer.

461
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:36,845
Like somehow
your cop connects

462
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:38,518
were gonna get us seats
with the billionaires.

463
00:28:38,542 --> 00:28:39,543
How stupid was I?

464
00:28:39,587 --> 00:28:41,458
I could have gone with my mom.

465
00:28:41,502 --> 00:28:43,678
We could've joined your brother,
died together,

466
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,245
like people we admired
were doing.

467
00:28:45,288 --> 00:28:47,247
But instead,
you made me live.

468
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,466
For what?

469
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,164
For the hell of the Tail?

470
00:28:51,207 --> 00:28:52,556
You don't for a second

471
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,689
have the right
to judge my choices.

472
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,039
You know how hard it is
to find love on this train.

473
00:28:57,083 --> 00:29:00,434
Yeah, not very,
apparently.

474
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,007
I bet you bunked with Josie
the moment I was gone.

475
00:29:10,836 --> 00:29:11,967
No, we didn't.

476
00:29:16,232 --> 00:29:17,930
We just survived.

477
00:29:30,203 --> 00:29:33,554
When they came for him,
he called hold.

478
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:37,993
And you hesitated, too.

479
00:29:38,037 --> 00:29:40,517
There were twice the Jackboots
we expected.

480
00:29:42,737 --> 00:29:44,217
We think he knew
it was coming.

481
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,480
He didn't know.

482
00:29:46,523 --> 00:29:48,830
You saw him fighting.

483
00:29:48,874 --> 00:29:50,701
Well...

484
00:29:50,745 --> 00:29:52,791
one way or another,
he's gone.

485
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:55,532
Everything shifts.

486
00:29:55,576 --> 00:29:59,406
You find yourself...

487
00:29:59,449 --> 00:30:00,886
in a new place.

488
00:30:04,454 --> 00:30:05,978
You get that?

489
00:30:07,544 --> 00:30:09,024
Oh, yeah.

490
00:30:09,068 --> 00:30:11,200
I got it all, Pike.

491
00:30:11,244 --> 00:30:13,724
Good.

492
00:30:13,768 --> 00:30:15,639
Good to hear.

493
00:30:30,785 --> 00:30:33,005
Now what?

494
00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:57,856
...but plants didn't always

495
00:30:57,899 --> 00:30:59,901
grow here in Ag-Sec.

496
00:30:59,945 --> 00:31:02,686
Actually,
before everything was frozen,

497
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:03,905
they grew in the ground!

498
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,474
I know. It's true!

499
00:31:07,517 --> 00:31:09,780
And that's why
it's very important

500
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:13,393
to learn about seeds and plants,

501
00:31:13,436 --> 00:31:15,438
so that one day,

502
00:31:15,482 --> 00:31:18,093
we can grow food
on a warm Earth again.

503
00:31:18,137 --> 00:31:20,835
All right, children,
move it along.

504
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,141
Watch your step.

505
00:31:25,318 --> 00:31:28,277
All this,
you can't even share.

506
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:31,498
There's 130 more cars
just like it.

507
00:31:31,541 --> 00:31:34,675
And, no, we can't.

508
00:31:34,718 --> 00:31:39,636
Oh.
There you are.

509
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,987
You really pulled out
all the stops, huh?

510
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:44,206
Using my ex as leverage.

511
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,729
Oh, show the Tailie
some food,

512
00:31:45,773 --> 00:31:47,035
he'd probably
do anything.

513
00:31:48,689 --> 00:31:50,734
How did it go
with the suspects?

514
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:52,780
Zarah didn't kill
Sean Wise.

515
00:31:52,823 --> 00:31:55,087
I'll give you that one
for free.

516
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,393
And there is way more to this
than you're saying.

517
00:31:57,437 --> 00:32:00,962
Otherwise, why would you be
so desperate for my help?

518
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:03,965
Well, of course
there's more to it.

519
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:05,532
Everything on
Mr. Wilford's train

520
00:32:05,575 --> 00:32:07,316
is connected.

521
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,145
A murder could upset
the entire ecosystem.

522
00:32:10,189 --> 00:32:11,799
It's complex.

523
00:32:11,842 --> 00:32:13,975
That might be
interesting for you.

524
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:15,387
Oh, everything up here
is interesting to him.

525
00:32:15,411 --> 00:32:16,847
He's all eyes.

526
00:32:16,891 --> 00:32:18,327
Then participate.

527
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:20,112
And stay.

528
00:32:20,155 --> 00:32:22,549
Reunite with Zarah,

529
00:32:22,592 --> 00:32:24,464
if that's on the table
for you both.

530
00:32:24,507 --> 00:32:26,727
You need me,

531
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,250
because this murder

532
00:32:28,294 --> 00:32:30,600
threatens Mr. Wilford's
precious order.

533
00:32:30,644 --> 00:32:32,951
Well, if you want to keep eating
your damn strawberries,

534
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:34,865
you know my demands...

535
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:37,085
Third Class calories,
space,

536
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:38,608
and reproductive rights
for the Tail.

537
00:32:38,652 --> 00:32:40,132
He just added
that one.

538
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:41,500
Okay. Now they want
to breed back there?

539
00:32:41,524 --> 00:32:43,526
This looks like abundance
to you.

540
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:46,486
It isn't.

541
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:51,708
This is strawberry crop 12,
in a balanced rotation of 14.

542
00:32:51,752 --> 00:32:55,886
This berry represents
5 or 6 kilocalories.

543
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:58,585
Sugars, dietary fiber,
vitamin C.

544
00:32:58,628 --> 00:33:03,329
Its place here is commensurate
with these values.

545
00:33:03,372 --> 00:33:05,157
Now, strawberries,

546
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,898
they're susceptible
to soil fungi, nematodes.

547
00:33:07,942 --> 00:33:09,117
So are we, actually...

548
00:33:09,161 --> 00:33:11,337
you, me,
everyone on this train.

549
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,210
So we don't let these
proliferate, either.

550
00:33:15,254 --> 00:33:19,736
Everything here survives
at the mercy of His balance.

551
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,304
And the truth is...

552
00:33:26,265 --> 00:33:29,790
You need
Wilford's strawberries

553
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:32,445
more than he needs you.

554
00:33:32,488 --> 00:33:35,578
♪ Happy birthday, Old Ivan

555
00:33:35,622 --> 00:33:38,712
♪ Happy birthday to you

556
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:41,976
84 years old!

557
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,586
Oldest man on Earth,
for all we know!

558
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,892
What would you like, viejo?

559
00:33:44,935 --> 00:33:47,242
There is only
one extravagance

560
00:33:47,286 --> 00:33:49,897
that I would wish
for my birthday.

561
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,985
What's that, old fella?

562
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,074
Privacy.

563
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:57,470
To be alone for one hour.

564
00:33:57,513 --> 00:34:00,864
With the Rachmaninoff
recording.

565
00:34:00,908 --> 00:34:02,779
Lights.
Mm.

566
00:34:02,823 --> 00:34:03,824
You know the one.

567
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:05,391
Yeah, the only one.

568
00:34:05,434 --> 00:34:08,655
All right, you heard him...
everybody out.

569
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:13,877
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

570
00:34:13,921 --> 00:34:16,402
Happy birthday, Ivan.

571
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:21,189
You just got to leave the phone
plugged in.

572
00:34:21,233 --> 00:34:23,496
Phone's got almost no battery.
Mm.

573
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:27,369
Thank you, Lights.

574
00:34:27,413 --> 00:34:29,676
Ahh.

575
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:44,881
Oh, God!
Oh, my God!

576
00:35:44,925 --> 00:35:46,709
What's going on?

577
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,459
No! No, no, no, no.

578
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:52,645
How was the harvest?

579
00:36:52,688 --> 00:36:55,430
I thought the Boss could use
some comfort food tonight.

580
00:36:55,474 --> 00:36:58,564
And I bet
you can use a drink.

581
00:37:03,699 --> 00:37:05,875
What should we toast to?

582
00:37:05,919 --> 00:37:09,531
How about whatever is making you
smile so much right now.

583
00:37:09,575 --> 00:37:11,316
Or is it whomever?

584
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:12,969
Is it that obvious?

585
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:18,366
Oh, you're beaming.

586
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:21,064
But there's something
I have to tell you.

587
00:37:21,108 --> 00:37:24,198
I'm bringing Nikki Genet
out of The Drawers.

588
00:37:25,808 --> 00:37:27,375
We locked up
the wrong person.

589
00:37:27,419 --> 00:37:29,464
I have no choice.

590
00:37:29,508 --> 00:37:30,900
How bad will she be?

591
00:37:30,944 --> 00:37:33,338
Two years in there?
Won't be pretty.

592
00:37:33,381 --> 00:37:34,948
Will you monitor her?

593
00:37:34,991 --> 00:37:36,428
Work with Klimpt?

594
00:37:36,471 --> 00:37:38,081
Learn what you can.

595
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,668
And if people start
asking the wrong questions?

596
00:37:39,692 --> 00:37:40,997
I'll handle that.

597
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:45,263
And... once this murder
is solved...

598
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:47,265
the other work
can continue. Well, then...

599
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:49,919
we better drink
to your detective.

600
00:37:49,963 --> 00:37:51,007
May he take the case.

601
00:37:51,051 --> 00:37:52,444
He'll take the case.

602
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,843
We were ready
to cut their throats

603
00:38:00,887 --> 00:38:02,715
before they took Layton! Man: Yeah!

604
00:38:02,758 --> 00:38:04,934
- Now Ivan?
- Preach.

605
00:38:04,978 --> 00:38:06,240
Man,
we stick to the script.

606
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,067
We finish what
we started.

607
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,503
Yeah? Huh?

608
00:38:08,547 --> 00:38:11,854
By axe and pike,
like we always have.

609
00:38:11,898 --> 00:38:13,726
- Yes!
- Yeah!

610
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:14,727
For Old Ivan!

611
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,076
Let's do this!

612
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:17,512
Old Ivan!

613
00:38:17,556 --> 00:38:19,297
Okay, here's what
we're gonna do

614
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,907
to open that door.

615
00:38:22,343 --> 00:38:23,703
Emergencia!

616
00:38:23,736 --> 00:38:26,216
Por favor, emergencia!

617
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:35,225
Lo siento,
el viejo murió.

618
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:38,359
- How?
- He hung himself.

619
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:39,969
Another?

620
00:38:40,013 --> 00:38:41,033
Leave it
to the next watch.

621
00:38:41,057 --> 00:38:42,276
Containment Protocol.

622
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,756
We gotta remove the body.

623
00:38:55,463 --> 00:38:58,771
Oh, my goodness.

624
00:38:58,814 --> 00:39:02,644
Nothing like mountain weather
to agitate everyone further.

625
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,085
One day at a time, Ruth.

626
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,920
Good evening, passengers.

627
00:39:17,964 --> 00:39:19,182
Be advised...

628
00:39:19,226 --> 00:39:21,402
track conditions
will deteriorate

629
00:39:21,446 --> 00:39:23,404
over the next 24 hours.

630
00:39:23,448 --> 00:39:28,670
Remain safe
and prepared to brace.

631
00:39:28,714 --> 00:39:30,585
From Mr. Wilford...

632
00:39:30,629 --> 00:39:32,152
Pikes.

633
00:39:32,195 --> 00:39:34,589
...and all of us
at Wilford Industries...

634
00:39:35,808 --> 00:39:37,940
good night.

635
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:40,508
Right.

636
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:52,694
Ramp.

637
00:39:52,738 --> 00:39:54,392
Steady.
Hold steady.

638
00:39:54,783 --> 00:39:55,828
- Ready?
- Get ready.

639
00:39:55,871 --> 00:39:57,090
- Ready?
- Stay ready!

640
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,451
Just what this day
was missing...

641
00:40:10,495 --> 00:40:13,019
another corpse.

642
00:40:13,062 --> 00:40:14,237
You strip off
the clothes?

643
00:40:14,281 --> 00:40:15,978
Sí.

644
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,160
Oi, no. Give them a moment.

645
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:27,546
- You want to let them do that?
- Give them a moment.

646
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,954
All right, let's see the body.
Come on!

647
00:40:34,997 --> 00:40:36,608
- All right, back it up!
- Let's go!

648
00:40:36,651 --> 00:40:38,087
Back it up! Move!

649
00:40:38,131 --> 00:40:39,437
Move back.

650
00:41:10,337 --> 00:41:11,817
Osweiller, help!

651
00:41:56,426 --> 00:41:57,993
Taking me back to the Tail now,
Roche?

652
00:41:58,037 --> 00:41:59,342
No.

653
00:41:59,386 --> 00:42:00,648
You're going to my lockup.

654
00:42:00,692 --> 00:42:02,258
I'm going home
to my wife.

655
00:42:02,302 --> 00:42:04,173
I gotta get back there,
man.

656
00:42:04,217 --> 00:42:05,784
Tail's all I got
in the world.

657
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:14,488
Doors!

658
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,837
Now!

659
00:42:28,633 --> 00:42:29,938
Aah!

660
00:43:09,456 --> 00:43:11,806
It's crazy out there,
man.

661
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:15,743
- What is he doing here?
- What happened?

662
00:43:15,767 --> 00:43:17,029
They got Till
as a hostage.

663
00:43:17,072 --> 00:43:18,421
Now we've got one,
too.

664
00:43:18,465 --> 00:43:20,554
Commander! Let him go.

665
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,618
The Tailies
have revolted again.

666
00:43:21,642 --> 00:43:23,601
Yes.
Mr. Wilford is aware.

667
00:43:23,644 --> 00:43:25,056
Look, whoever they are,
I know them, okay?

668
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,342
I can help.

669
00:43:26,386 --> 00:43:27,648
This is going too far
with him.

670
00:43:27,692 --> 00:43:29,868
Please.
They'll listen to me.

671
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:35,438
Bastard,
I know who you are.

672
00:43:35,482 --> 00:43:37,571
Yeah.
I remember you, too.

673
00:43:41,444 --> 00:43:42,620
3 minutes.

674
00:43:42,663 --> 00:43:44,665
Then we kill you all.

675
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:56,242
Tailies?

676
00:43:56,285 --> 00:43:57,765
Who's left?

677
00:43:57,809 --> 00:43:58,940
It's Layton.

678
00:43:58,984 --> 00:44:00,376
Layton, you're a coward!

679
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:05,164
Pike?

680
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:14,173
We don't want you here.

681
00:44:21,093 --> 00:44:23,704
I'm coming in. No, you're not!

682
00:44:23,748 --> 00:44:25,010
Who's with you?

683
00:44:29,449 --> 00:44:31,059
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

684
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,061
Hey.

685
00:44:33,105 --> 00:44:35,629
Hey, boys.

686
00:44:42,418 --> 00:44:44,029
How's it going?

687
00:44:44,072 --> 00:44:45,354
Yo, Layton,
where you coming from, man?

688
00:44:45,378 --> 00:44:46,901
Uptrain, man.

689
00:44:46,945 --> 00:44:48,052
Yo, they pulled me up
to solve a murder.

690
00:44:48,076 --> 00:44:49,338
You believe that?

691
00:44:49,382 --> 00:44:51,253
They killing each other
up there.

692
00:44:51,297 --> 00:44:53,212
Bullshit.

693
00:44:53,255 --> 00:44:55,301
You're a traitor.

694
00:44:55,344 --> 00:44:57,695
This only ends one way.

695
00:45:00,872 --> 00:45:04,136
Yeah.

696
00:45:04,179 --> 00:45:06,529
They're gonna storm in here,
and they're gonna butcher us.

697
00:45:06,573 --> 00:45:08,314
- Two minutes!
- Aw, God damn it, man.

698
00:45:08,357 --> 00:45:10,098
- Shut up, Z!
- I got a family, man!

699
00:45:10,142 --> 00:45:13,928
I got a wife and a kid
on this train, Pike!

700
00:45:13,972 --> 00:45:14,886
Old Ivan offed himself,
man.

701
00:45:14,929 --> 00:45:15,887
Old Ivan offed himself,
man.

702
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:17,715
What?

703
00:45:17,758 --> 00:45:21,762
He hung himself with
an electrical cord.

704
00:45:21,806 --> 00:45:24,591
That's what sparked
this whole thing.

705
00:45:26,811 --> 00:45:30,292
Pike... whatever happened
between us,

706
00:45:30,336 --> 00:45:34,601
we're brothers.

707
00:45:34,644 --> 00:45:36,734
I think I got a way
we get out of this alive.

708
00:45:50,138 --> 00:45:51,923
Hey.

709
00:45:53,185 --> 00:45:57,145
It's okay. It's okay.

710
00:45:57,189 --> 00:45:58,364
Huh?

711
00:45:58,407 --> 00:46:01,323
Unh-unh. Hey.

712
00:46:01,367 --> 00:46:02,542
Right here.

713
00:46:02,585 --> 00:46:05,153
It's all right.

714
00:46:06,198 --> 00:46:07,373
I'm sorry.

715
00:46:08,591 --> 00:46:10,158
- No! Wait!
- Shh!

716
00:46:10,202 --> 00:46:11,614
- What are you doing?!
- Here's what you do...

717
00:46:11,638 --> 00:46:12,789
surrender yourselves
to The Drawers.

718
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:14,423
What? No way.

719
00:46:14,467 --> 00:46:15,990
It's like sleep.
It's like sleep.

720
00:46:16,034 --> 00:46:17,402
They put you to sleep. Okay, for how long?

721
00:46:17,426 --> 00:46:18,340
It is a goddamn coffin!

722
00:46:18,384 --> 00:46:19,994
Listen to me.

723
00:46:20,038 --> 00:46:23,650
By my count, I went uptrain
130 cars today, okay?

724
00:46:23,693 --> 00:46:26,348
I seen shit none of us
could've imagined.

725
00:46:26,392 --> 00:46:31,789
I can piece together schedules,
security detail, all right?

726
00:46:31,832 --> 00:46:34,313
Old Ivan dreamed of this.

727
00:46:38,143 --> 00:46:39,318
Aah!

728
00:46:46,238 --> 00:46:49,328
Look at the blood.

729
00:46:51,286 --> 00:46:53,158
We only made it one car.

730
00:46:56,639 --> 00:46:58,598
I'm done.
I'm done, Layton.

731
00:46:58,641 --> 00:47:01,383
Hey. One Tail.

732
00:47:01,427 --> 00:47:04,430
We need you uptrain...

733
00:47:04,473 --> 00:47:07,389
waiting...

734
00:47:07,433 --> 00:47:09,565
for the day
we take the Engine.

735
00:47:16,355 --> 00:47:18,705
We'll Drawer the remaining
three rebels indefinitely.

736
00:47:18,748 --> 00:47:20,402
No, the Drawers won't do.

737
00:47:20,446 --> 00:47:23,884
Mr. Wilford demands swift
justice when order is attacked.

738
00:47:23,928 --> 00:47:25,514
Six men.
I want six heads.

739
00:47:25,538 --> 00:47:26,858
Then you'll have
six more martyrs.

740
00:47:26,887 --> 00:47:29,237
And 'round and 'round
we go again.

741
00:47:30,499 --> 00:47:31,587
I'll do it.

742
00:47:35,287 --> 00:47:37,071
I'll solve your murder.

743
00:47:37,115 --> 00:47:41,423
I will get Mr. Wilford
his order back.

744
00:47:41,467 --> 00:47:44,252
And you can have mercy
on the Tail.

745
00:47:46,254 --> 00:47:49,257
Mr. Wilford will want an example
made immediately,

746
00:47:49,301 --> 00:47:51,694
but...

747
00:47:51,738 --> 00:47:54,480
there's to be no more
loss of life.

748
00:47:54,523 --> 00:47:57,048
In the morning, Ruth will take
a significant arm.

749
00:47:57,091 --> 00:48:00,051
Spectacle... at least
it'll make an impression.

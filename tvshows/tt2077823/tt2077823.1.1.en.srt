2
00:00:30,422 --> 00:00:32,964
Now,
you two have done good so far.

3
00:00:33,047 --> 00:00:35,089
So, keep calm,
keep breathing right.

4
00:00:35,172 --> 00:00:36,422
It's almost over.

5
00:00:36,506 --> 00:00:37,714
What are they saying now?

6
00:00:37,798 --> 00:00:39,047
Shut up.

7
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,649
You shouldn't
talk to your wife that way.

8
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:41,547
She's been through a lot.

9
00:00:41,631 --> 00:00:42,547
Listen here!

10
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:43,881
No, you listen.

11
00:00:43,964 --> 00:00:46,106
You listen and do exactly
what the fuck I tell you to do

12
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,214
or this ends real bad.

13
00:00:48,297 --> 00:00:51,089
Do you see that desk behind you?

14
00:00:51,172 --> 00:00:54,881
Put your fancy fucking suitcase
on that desk.

15
00:00:54,964 --> 00:00:56,964
Not until I see my son.

16
00:00:57,047 --> 00:00:58,381
All right.

17
00:00:58,464 --> 00:01:00,589
They're loading up a car
up above,

18
00:01:00,673 --> 00:01:02,547
your kid's in that car.

19
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:05,923
Put the case on the desk
and open it up.

20
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:07,798
O... O... O... Okay.
Hold... Hold on.

21
00:01:17,297 --> 00:01:18,297
I'm here.

22
00:01:18,339 --> 00:01:20,214
We're gonna give you a look.

23
00:01:20,297 --> 00:01:22,589
You see the kid,
you run down the street.

24
00:01:22,673 --> 00:01:25,005
Get the kid off the car,
don't look back,

25
00:01:25,089 --> 00:01:26,148
and never say a word about it.

26
00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:27,607
He's on the car.
Charlie's on the car.

27
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:29,023
Do we understand each other?

28
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,482
- Yes, yes.
- Please. Please don't hurt him.

29
00:01:30,506 --> 00:01:32,089
Here it comes.

30
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:47,881
Charlie.

31
00:01:58,673 --> 00:01:59,964
Let's go, let's go!

32
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,923
- Excuse me.
- Move, move.

33
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,047
Excuse me.

34
00:02:16,047 --> 00:02:18,673
Oh, Charlie boy.
Charlie boy.

35
00:02:18,756 --> 00:02:20,464
Jesus.

36
00:02:20,547 --> 00:02:22,756
Oh, you're such a brave boy.

37
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:24,172
You're not crying.

38
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:33,631
Matthew. Matthew.

39
00:02:33,714 --> 00:02:34,631
Yes.

40
00:02:34,714 --> 00:02:37,089
What's wrong?
What's wrong with him?

41
00:02:37,172 --> 00:02:38,547
What's wrong with him?

42
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:43,005
Charlie!

43
00:02:43,089 --> 00:02:44,422
Jesus Christ!

44
00:02:44,506 --> 00:02:47,255
Help! Help!

45
00:02:48,089 --> 00:02:49,130
Jesus!

46
00:02:51,214 --> 00:02:52,422
Help!

47
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,089
Help!

48
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:13,839
Okay, Mason, here's one for you.

49
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:16,089
Are you being cheated
out of life's thrills?

50
00:03:19,339 --> 00:03:20,339
Probably.

51
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:22,756
Love, romance, excitement?

52
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:24,631
Never heard of them.

53
00:03:24,714 --> 00:03:26,394
Mayhaps
you should read Lipstick Girl

54
00:03:26,464 --> 00:03:27,756
by Edna Robb Webster.

55
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:29,422
Never heard of her.

56
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:33,714
Hey, what do you know?
It begins today.

57
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:36,381
Forty cents
for two coffees and toast?

58
00:03:36,464 --> 00:03:38,547
How many gallons
do you throw in the truck?

59
00:03:38,631 --> 00:03:40,047
- Uh, six.
- Six gallons?

60
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,422
Three days of meals,
another two days of gas.

61
00:03:42,506 --> 00:03:44,047
Oh, yeah.
Here we go.

62
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,381
Chapter one.

63
00:03:45,464 --> 00:03:47,631
The Pappe & Son
Department Store,

64
00:03:47,714 --> 00:03:50,339
the largest mercantile
establishment in Mitchelfield

65
00:03:50,422 --> 00:03:53,673
- was arousing itself noise...
- S.S. Chubby's setting sail.

66
00:03:53,756 --> 00:03:56,089
- Hey. Come on.
- Say goodbye to Edna.

67
00:03:56,172 --> 00:03:57,940
Get out in front of him;
I'll follow from behind.

68
00:03:57,964 --> 00:03:59,839
- Lot of behind to follow.
- Go.

69
00:04:37,422 --> 00:04:38,798
You're kidding me.

70
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:40,422
We get to go to the movies.

71
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:50,172
Hey!

72
00:04:50,255 --> 00:04:51,756
Cut it out now.

73
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:58,023
Fucking horse
kicking him in the ass,

74
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,964
how do you not
find that hilarious?

75
00:05:00,047 --> 00:05:01,589
I grew up on a farm.

76
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:05,714
Steering's all loose.

77
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,255
- What'd you do it?
- I didn't do anything.

78
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:11,774
You know, maybe Chubby's
keeping it clean

79
00:05:11,798 --> 00:05:13,815
'cause he's seen this milk truck
following him around town.

80
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:16,172
If you don't have a car,
don't complain.

81
00:05:16,255 --> 00:05:17,923
Not my fault,
Ruthie broke the axle.

82
00:05:18,005 --> 00:05:19,857
- Another complaint.
- Just 'cause the guy

83
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:21,357
has a high-pitched voice,
that's no reason

84
00:05:21,381 --> 00:05:22,798
to rob a guy of his livelihood.

85
00:05:22,881 --> 00:05:24,881
He brought a lot of joy
to a lot of people.

86
00:05:24,964 --> 00:05:26,964
Well, he's not bringing me any.

87
00:05:27,047 --> 00:05:30,714
Three days waiting for him
to stick his dick in something.

88
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:33,589
Studio signs him to a contract,
they should honor it.

89
00:05:33,673 --> 00:05:35,273
Who cares what he does
with his pants off?

90
00:05:35,297 --> 00:05:37,673
Walt LeBaron cares, that's who.

91
00:05:37,756 --> 00:05:39,005
He's the one who's paying you.

92
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,839
Morals clause, shmorals clause.

93
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,756
Whole town needs a shot
in the dick.

94
00:05:44,506 --> 00:05:46,422
Hey, heading right.

95
00:06:00,631 --> 00:06:01,631
Hey.

96
00:06:03,506 --> 00:06:05,381
Hi, Chubby.

97
00:06:05,464 --> 00:06:07,714
Well, hello, Red.

98
00:06:07,798 --> 00:06:09,255
Oh, wow.

99
00:06:11,047 --> 00:06:12,547
Here we go.

100
00:06:12,631 --> 00:06:16,130
Hey, how about I have a look?
You stay in the truck?

101
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:17,673
Sure.

102
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,464
You know, that's your problem.
You get no pleasure out of life.

103
00:06:24,547 --> 00:06:25,547
Shut up.

104
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:33,506
Oh, God. Oh, God.

105
00:07:35,964 --> 00:07:39,214
Pete, start the truck!

106
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,130
Pete, start the car!

107
00:07:42,214 --> 00:07:44,589
Son of a bitch!

108
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,589
I'll get you, you prick!

109
00:07:46,673 --> 00:07:48,130
You sons of bitches!

110
00:07:48,214 --> 00:07:50,631
I'm going to kill you,
you cocksuckers.

111
00:07:50,714 --> 00:07:51,923
Oh, yeah!

112
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,589
Chubby, you glorious bastard!

113
00:07:54,673 --> 00:07:56,255
He threw a shoe at me.

114
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:58,881
I'm your biggest fan!

115
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:21,255
Evening, Rigoberto.
Can you open the gate?

116
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:24,756
I can if you say it.

117
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,381
Something about a clown.

118
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:38,422
Does it have to be in Spanish?

119
00:08:38,506 --> 00:08:40,214
This whole place
used to be Spanish.

120
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,297
Shit.

121
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:50,506
What are you doing?
Trying to get yourself killed?

122
00:10:52,881 --> 00:10:54,172
You want some breakfast?

123
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:12,881
Here, get up, get up.

124
00:11:14,714 --> 00:11:17,673
Good girl. Good girl. Good girl.

125
00:11:17,756 --> 00:11:20,631
Eat your hay.
Stay off the runway.

126
00:11:22,964 --> 00:11:24,214
Come on.

127
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:31,089
Now, stay.

128
00:11:33,255 --> 00:11:34,255
Not you.

129
00:11:34,297 --> 00:11:36,255
They don't want me
around either.

130
00:12:08,422 --> 00:12:11,130
"I'd have said it was over
when the talkies came."

131
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,297
But clearly,

132
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:17,714
the man still has a lot
to offer the world.

133
00:12:17,798 --> 00:12:20,172
How did you get in here?

134
00:12:20,255 --> 00:12:22,547
"The clown carries you."

135
00:12:22,631 --> 00:12:25,339
He just... he just gave you
the password?

136
00:12:25,422 --> 00:12:27,464
Well,
I'm a very persuasive lawyer.

137
00:12:28,464 --> 00:12:30,798
- You forget that sometimes.
- Yup.

138
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:34,089
I try to forget a lot of things.

139
00:12:34,172 --> 00:12:36,798
At some point, you got to admit
this isn't working out.

140
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,339
What do you mean?

141
00:12:38,964 --> 00:12:40,673
Let me speak for the dead

142
00:12:40,756 --> 00:12:43,839
and say your parents
didn't want this for you.

143
00:12:44,756 --> 00:12:46,297
The farm's still here.

144
00:12:46,381 --> 00:12:48,756
You got pans on their bed.

145
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,214
What do you want, E.B.?

146
00:12:50,297 --> 00:12:53,756
Herman Baggerly
called me last night.

147
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,798
I called you, you don't answer.

148
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:58,798
Who's Herman Baggerly?

149
00:12:58,881 --> 00:13:01,923
Major player, boyo.
Lumber, real estate,

150
00:13:02,005 --> 00:13:04,673
one of the fattest
bank accounts in the city.

151
00:13:04,756 --> 00:13:06,255
What's he doing with you then?

152
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:08,589
I've helped him in the past.

153
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:11,923
Certain business matters
which require discretion

154
00:13:12,005 --> 00:13:13,964
- and finesse.
- Yeah, 20 bucks

155
00:13:14,047 --> 00:13:16,798
- a billable hour.
- Well, man has to eat.

156
00:13:16,881 --> 00:13:18,964
And I'd say
we both understand that.

157
00:13:19,047 --> 00:13:21,506
And you need me why, E.B.?

158
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:23,506
Because some friend of his
is in trouble,

159
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:26,005
the police are involved
and you're good at your job.

160
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:27,464
3:00 p.m. at my office.

161
00:13:27,547 --> 00:13:29,506
I don't know,
I got a lot going on today.

162
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:31,589
The Chubby thing,
and I'm due in court.

163
00:13:31,673 --> 00:13:34,130
I'm getting paid to serve
as a material witness.

164
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:37,631
- That Frank Dillon case.
- Deep pockets on Baggerly.

165
00:13:37,714 --> 00:13:40,339
- Opportunity for both of us.
- Yeah? Is he looking to buy

166
00:13:40,422 --> 00:13:42,964
a two-cow dairy
in the middle of an airport?

167
00:13:43,047 --> 00:13:44,756
You're really thinking to sell?

168
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,798
I haven't seen you
in three months, E.B.

169
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:53,130
Well, it's been quiet
out there, boyo.

170
00:13:53,214 --> 00:13:54,297
I don't deny it.

171
00:13:55,547 --> 00:13:57,506
But this is a live one.

172
00:13:57,589 --> 00:13:59,589
3:00 p.m., wear your good suit.

173
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:01,923
This is my good suit.

174
00:14:03,172 --> 00:14:04,923
And there's egg on your tie.

175
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:18,255
Oh, boy.

176
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:20,506
Yeah, that's him all right.

177
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:22,673
No question
of moral relativity here.

178
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:24,214
I mean, that's

179
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:26,130
that's food.

180
00:14:26,214 --> 00:14:28,798
- Pumpkin pie, I'm pretty sure.
- I blame his agent.

181
00:14:28,881 --> 00:14:30,839
I mean, I got nothing
against the guy myself,

182
00:14:30,923 --> 00:14:32,130
you understand but, um

183
00:14:32,214 --> 00:14:34,339
I'm not here to judge anyone,
Mr. LeBaron.

184
00:14:34,422 --> 00:14:36,297
- I just wanna get paid.
- Ah,

185
00:14:36,381 --> 00:14:39,756
I will have someone
cut you a check.

186
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,589
Business affairs,
please, Mitch.

187
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:44,172
What did we say, um, 200?

188
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:46,881
We did say that.
Of course, that was for pictures

189
00:14:46,964 --> 00:14:48,923
of Chubby Carmichael but, uh,

190
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:51,964
these happen to be pictures
of, um, Velma Fuller,

191
00:14:53,756 --> 00:14:55,881
or should I "Call Her Red"?

192
00:14:55,964 --> 00:14:57,422
Business affairs.

193
00:14:58,714 --> 00:15:01,297
Hello? Hello...

194
00:15:03,631 --> 00:15:04,756
Okay.

195
00:15:08,214 --> 00:15:09,547
How much did you have in mind?

196
00:15:09,631 --> 00:15:11,172
Five hundred seems fair.

197
00:15:12,673 --> 00:15:14,881
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Fine, make it six,

198
00:15:14,964 --> 00:15:16,884
- that's serious...
- You got some fucking nerve.

199
00:15:16,964 --> 00:15:19,839
Nerve
and these nasty, nasty pictures

200
00:15:19,923 --> 00:15:21,339
of your up-and-coming starlet.

201
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,631
Okay.

202
00:15:25,756 --> 00:15:28,172
I'm gonna have to walk this up
to Mr. Hammersmith.

203
00:15:30,172 --> 00:15:31,714
Be sure to send him my regards.

204
00:15:36,631 --> 00:15:37,839
Mason

205
00:15:38,923 --> 00:15:41,422
you've got an egg stain
on your tie.

206
00:15:41,506 --> 00:15:43,172
Yeah, turns out it's mustard.

207
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:49,482
How was your Christmas?

208
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:50,964
Yeah, it came and went.

209
00:15:51,047 --> 00:15:53,839
My wife's folks came by
on the day.

210
00:15:53,923 --> 00:15:55,255
Her mom brought a fruitcake,

211
00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:57,255
could have been used
by the pharaohs.

212
00:15:57,339 --> 00:15:59,005
Kids cried
when I made them eat it.

213
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,381
You got a kid, right?

214
00:16:06,464 --> 00:16:07,673
Yeah, lives with his mom.

215
00:16:07,756 --> 00:16:09,631
Well, you spent Christmas
with them, right?

216
00:16:09,714 --> 00:16:10,964
- No.
- Well, how come?

217
00:16:11,047 --> 00:16:13,547
Are you, um,
lonely or something, Virgil?

218
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:22,798
He went out happy.

219
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:26,130
Well, if happy's drowning
in panties and a matching bra,

220
00:16:26,214 --> 00:16:27,255
yeah, why not?

221
00:16:28,547 --> 00:16:30,547
He was wearing man clothes
on the outside.

222
00:16:36,297 --> 00:16:37,714
What's with that?

223
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:39,172
Oh, my next patient.

224
00:16:39,255 --> 00:16:41,756
Kidnapping gone way wrong.

225
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,547
Worst thing you ever seen.

226
00:16:43,631 --> 00:16:45,214
What do you know what I've seen?

227
00:16:56,923 --> 00:16:58,506
How's this?

228
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:00,589
I like it better than the suit.

229
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,631
I got a domestic stabbing
with a three piece, if you want.

230
00:17:07,714 --> 00:17:10,089
Mr. Mason,
in what capacity were you hired

231
00:17:10,172 --> 00:17:11,673
- by the defense?
- I was hired

232
00:17:11,756 --> 00:17:12,923
as a private investigator.

233
00:17:13,005 --> 00:17:15,839
And is that,
these private investigations,

234
00:17:15,923 --> 00:17:18,589
the current means
by which you earn a living?

235
00:17:18,673 --> 00:17:21,172
You know it is, Fenton.

236
00:17:21,255 --> 00:17:24,798
Um, pardon me.
Uh, yes, Mr. Bostwick.

237
00:17:24,881 --> 00:17:26,881
Now,
am I correct in asserting

238
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:29,255
that you were recently cited
for assault?

239
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:35,214
- Mr. Mason.
- I'm sorry. What?

240
00:17:35,297 --> 00:17:36,881
A complaint for assault.

241
00:17:36,964 --> 00:17:39,065
- This is irrelevant, Your Honor.
- I'm sure

242
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:40,774
- that you resent this line...
- No, what I resent

243
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:42,589
is Alvin Rutherford
showing up repeatedly

244
00:17:42,673 --> 00:17:44,673
and offering me pennies
on the dollar for a home

245
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:46,214
my father built
with his own hands.

246
00:17:46,297 --> 00:17:48,798
Tragic, Mr. Mason, but assault?

247
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:51,547
I threw a cowpie at him.

248
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,214
That's funny.

249
00:17:55,297 --> 00:17:57,673
However, far less amusing

250
00:17:57,756 --> 00:18:01,089
is the dishonorable end
to your military career.

251
00:18:03,464 --> 00:18:05,089
That has nothing to do
with this trial.

252
00:18:05,172 --> 00:18:07,589
A blue discharge
for conduct unbecoming.

253
00:18:07,673 --> 00:18:09,923
Would you care to elaborate
on that, Mr. Mason?

254
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:13,130
- Was that a mistake?
- Feel free to jump in, Frank.

255
00:18:13,506 --> 00:18:15,547
Objection.

256
00:18:15,631 --> 00:18:17,881
- Question of relevance.
- You're goddamn right.

257
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:19,089
Sustained.

258
00:18:19,172 --> 00:18:20,881
- Watch the God talk, sir.
- Sorry.

259
00:18:20,964 --> 00:18:22,148
Nothing further, Your Honor.

260
00:18:22,172 --> 00:18:23,815
E.B. send you
'cause he thought I forgot

261
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:24,923
the way to the office?

262
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:26,190
The meeting's changed.

263
00:18:26,214 --> 00:18:27,798
We're going to Pasadena now.

264
00:18:27,881 --> 00:18:29,422
We are?
Fine, we can take my truck.

265
00:18:29,506 --> 00:18:32,506
We could if the plan was to make
the world's worst impression.

266
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:33,909
Oh, I don't have to
plan for that.

267
00:18:33,964 --> 00:18:35,214
That happens naturally.

268
00:18:35,297 --> 00:18:37,190
I'll say, you were just four
words from contempt of court.

269
00:18:37,214 --> 00:18:39,255
Go fuck yourself.
I could have got that in.

270
00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:41,589
Thus demonstrating
your masterful knowledge

271
00:18:41,673 --> 00:18:43,714
- of legal decorum.
- Frank Dillon is sitting there

272
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:46,089
like a monument to the useless
and the judge is concerned

273
00:18:46,172 --> 00:18:48,297
with my decorum?
Why didn't he hold him

274
00:18:48,381 --> 00:18:50,422
in contempt?
Because I sure as hell did.

275
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:51,964
Letting him dig into me
like that.

276
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,089
A fucking peanut vendor
would have known to object.

277
00:18:54,172 --> 00:18:56,422
So many windmills,
so little time.

278
00:19:00,297 --> 00:19:01,756
How are you today, Miss Street?

279
00:19:03,089 --> 00:19:04,130
Peachy.

280
00:19:04,214 --> 00:19:06,047
How are you, Mr. Mason?

281
00:19:07,589 --> 00:19:09,964
I wasn't
expecting a congregation.

282
00:19:10,047 --> 00:19:12,005
I rely on Miss Street

283
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:13,756
to keep the facts straight,
Herman.

284
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:15,714
Do you intend
to take notes, Miss?

285
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:17,631
That's generally what I do.

286
00:19:17,714 --> 00:19:19,422
Unless you object.

287
00:19:20,297 --> 00:19:22,464
And you're a detective,
Mr. Mason?

288
00:19:22,547 --> 00:19:25,089
It's a fancy word
for a busybody, but yes.

289
00:19:25,172 --> 00:19:29,172
We've been working together
since, uh... when was it?

290
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:30,756
Just after the war.

291
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:33,172
Gave him his first job back
from France,

292
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,798
- isn't that right, Perry?
- You served overseas?

293
00:19:35,881 --> 00:19:37,214
With lots of other farm boys.

294
00:19:37,297 --> 00:19:39,005
Mr. Mason was in the army,

295
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:42,172
survived
the Battle of the Argonne.

296
00:19:42,255 --> 00:19:44,839
How can we help you,
Mr. Baggerly?

297
00:19:44,923 --> 00:19:47,756
It's not me
that needs help, Mr. Mason.

298
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:51,005
Matthew and Emily Dodson,

299
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,547
an unspeakable act

300
00:19:53,631 --> 00:19:56,005
was visited upon them,
they're quite overwhelmed.

301
00:19:56,089 --> 00:19:58,255
Consider us at their service.

302
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:03,631
- Friends of yours?
- Members of my church.

303
00:20:03,714 --> 00:20:06,130
Working people
without many resources.

304
00:20:06,214 --> 00:20:09,589
Well, God has put you
in their path.

305
00:20:10,297 --> 00:20:12,005
Is this a...

306
00:20:12,089 --> 00:20:13,714
Radiant Assembly of God.

307
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:17,047
- Right. On the radio.
- Sister Alice.

308
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,756
A woman of wonder-working power.

309
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,047
I won't hesitate to say
that she changed my life.

310
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:27,339
Do the Dodsons know
you contacted me, Herman?

311
00:20:27,422 --> 00:20:30,673
They're anxiously
awaiting your guidance, Elias.

312
00:20:30,756 --> 00:20:32,005
What about the police?

313
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:34,714
How's that?

314
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:36,714
Well, they'll be
on this hammer and tongs.

315
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:38,089
Why not leave it to them?

316
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:44,422
I'll be frank, Mr. Mason.

317
00:20:46,464 --> 00:20:49,214
I don't trust the Los Angeles
Police Department

318
00:20:49,297 --> 00:20:50,798
to do the job that's needed.

319
00:20:53,673 --> 00:20:55,005
Neither would I.

320
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:08,190
So you found this upstairs?

321
00:21:08,214 --> 00:21:09,881
I told you, my wife did.

322
00:21:09,964 --> 00:21:11,839
- I was at work.
- And she called you?

323
00:21:12,631 --> 00:21:14,547
Yeah. Hysterical.

324
00:21:14,631 --> 00:21:16,506
Why neither one of you
call the police?

325
00:21:17,172 --> 00:21:18,297
Read the note.

326
00:21:19,005 --> 00:21:21,589
You can read, can't you?

327
00:21:21,673 --> 00:21:25,422
So your wife finds the note,
calls you, what she do next?

328
00:21:25,506 --> 00:21:26,906
How should I know? Ask her.

329
00:21:26,964 --> 00:21:28,523
We'll get to her in a minute.

330
00:21:28,547 --> 00:21:30,381
You own a grocery store,

331
00:21:30,464 --> 00:21:32,881
- much money in that?
- What?

332
00:21:33,005 --> 00:21:34,422
Nice house for a grocer.

333
00:21:34,506 --> 00:21:36,297
It can't be cheap to maintain.

334
00:21:36,381 --> 00:21:37,649
What's that supposed to mean?

335
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:39,255
How long does it take to get

336
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,106
- from the grocery store to here?
- What difference does it make?

337
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,440
- Easy, Matthew...
- How am... Are you suggesting

338
00:21:42,464 --> 00:21:45,631
I had something to do with it?
What the hell?

339
00:21:45,714 --> 00:21:47,398
Just covering
all angles, Mr. Dodson.

340
00:21:47,422 --> 00:21:48,690
Where was I? Who saw me?

341
00:21:48,714 --> 00:21:49,964
I didn't kidnap my son.

342
00:21:50,047 --> 00:21:52,523
- I didn't murder my own son.
- No one is saying you did.

343
00:21:52,547 --> 00:21:54,547
Well, he is!
And he's dancing around,

344
00:21:54,631 --> 00:21:56,130
but that's what
he fucking thinks.

345
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:58,214
Maybe this is a good time
for a little break.

346
00:21:58,297 --> 00:22:00,547
Sound okay to you,
Detective Holcomb?

347
00:22:03,547 --> 00:22:04,923
Yeah. Why not.

348
00:22:05,005 --> 00:22:07,381
- Get some fresh air.
- It's all right.

349
00:22:07,464 --> 00:22:08,824
You treated me like...
You can't...

350
00:22:08,881 --> 00:22:10,523
- You can't just walk...
- Easy now, Matthew.

351
00:22:10,547 --> 00:22:12,756
Let's have a little drink
of cold water, shall we?

352
00:22:13,756 --> 00:22:15,339
Water. Right, great idea.

353
00:22:15,422 --> 00:22:16,464
That'll fix everything.

354
00:22:16,547 --> 00:22:18,589
It's all part of the process.

355
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:16,714
Are you the man
that works with Mr. Jonathan?

356
00:24:19,547 --> 00:24:22,673
Yes, ma'am. Perry.

357
00:24:26,881 --> 00:24:28,506
I'm Emily Dodson.

358
00:24:29,381 --> 00:24:30,547
Charlie's mother.

359
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:39,589
Offer you a cigarette,
Mrs. Dodson?

360
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:43,756
If you promise not to tell
my husband.

361
00:24:45,547 --> 00:24:46,756
Wouldn't dream of it.

362
00:25:05,214 --> 00:25:06,255
Thank you.

363
00:25:10,547 --> 00:25:12,589
You were in the war,
weren't you?

364
00:25:14,923 --> 00:25:16,964
The way you hold your cigarette.

365
00:25:17,047 --> 00:25:18,631
Hiding the ember in your palm.

366
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:21,190
I guess I'm still trained
not to give them

367
00:25:21,214 --> 00:25:22,381
something to shoot at.

368
00:25:24,005 --> 00:25:26,047
Was your husband over there?

369
00:25:28,005 --> 00:25:29,047
Brother.

370
00:25:30,172 --> 00:25:33,047
I haven't seen him
since we left Missouri.

371
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,589
I really wish they'd let me
clean in here.

372
00:25:37,756 --> 00:25:39,297
All this fingerprint dust...

373
00:25:40,923 --> 00:25:44,839
Can't help feeling that it
reflects poorly on me somehow.

374
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:48,339
Oh, I don't...
I don't think poorly of you.

375
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:51,798
God does.

376
00:25:53,798 --> 00:25:55,172
That's why I'm being punished.

377
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,714
Do you have children, Mr. Perry?

378
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:05,839
It's... It's Mason.
Perry is my first name.

379
00:26:07,047 --> 00:26:08,172
I have a son.

380
00:26:10,005 --> 00:26:11,422
What's his name?

381
00:26:14,631 --> 00:26:15,798
Theodore.

382
00:26:15,881 --> 00:26:16,964
Teddy.

383
00:26:18,964 --> 00:26:20,381
How old?

384
00:26:20,464 --> 00:26:22,130
Nine in February.

385
00:26:26,172 --> 00:26:27,547
Charlie likes turtles.

386
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:31,297
Liked.

387
00:26:35,381 --> 00:26:36,964
What's your boy fond of?

388
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,172
Firetrucks.

389
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:48,673
I bet

390
00:26:50,255 --> 00:26:53,214
nine is a good age for a boy.

391
00:27:05,547 --> 00:27:06,714
So.

392
00:27:09,381 --> 00:27:10,589
I'm sorry.

393
00:27:20,547 --> 00:27:21,867
Yeah, fine,
he's a hothead,

394
00:27:21,923 --> 00:27:24,005
but he's a little too touchy
if you ask me.

395
00:27:24,756 --> 00:27:25,964
And her?

396
00:27:26,047 --> 00:27:28,756
She was just sitting
downstairs the whole time?

397
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:31,464
She told the detectives
she gave the boy a bath,

398
00:27:31,547 --> 00:27:34,464
put him to bed,
fell asleep by the fire

399
00:27:34,547 --> 00:27:35,964
listening to the radio.

400
00:27:36,047 --> 00:27:38,381
Actually,
she puts Charlie to bed,

401
00:27:38,464 --> 00:27:40,422
goes downstairs
to clean up the kitchen,

402
00:27:40,506 --> 00:27:42,381
goes back upstairs
to check on him

403
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,339
then goes downstairs
and falls asleep

404
00:27:44,422 --> 00:27:45,756
listening to the radio.

405
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:48,756
She doesn't twitch an eyelid

406
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:50,631
while someone creeps
into her house

407
00:27:50,714 --> 00:27:52,506
and nabs her kid?

408
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:56,130
- You think she's a drinker?
- No. She's a mother.

409
00:27:56,214 --> 00:27:59,005
Feeding, changing,
burping, screaming,

410
00:27:59,089 --> 00:28:00,422
you wouldn't last a minute.

411
00:28:00,506 --> 00:28:02,839
Is this something
you know about?

412
00:28:02,923 --> 00:28:04,923
Call it an educated guess.

413
00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:11,506
All right.
You're the kidnapper,

414
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:13,673
you have to case that house
long enough to know.

415
00:28:13,756 --> 00:28:15,506
Matthew's hours
at the grocery store,

416
00:28:15,589 --> 00:28:17,798
the time Emily
gives Charlie the bath,

417
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:20,506
then puts him down,
then falls asleep herself,

418
00:28:20,589 --> 00:28:22,297
unless you have someone
on the inside.

419
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:24,422
Oh, so you agree
with the police.

420
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:27,047
You think the Dodsons
had something to do with it.

421
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,964
- I'm not agreeing with anyone.
- I sure hope not.

422
00:28:30,047 --> 00:28:31,339
I've stood with those two.

423
00:28:31,964 --> 00:28:34,214
That's grief, not guilt.

424
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:36,214
I'm just pointing out
that someone knew

425
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,089
they were good
for a hundred grand.

426
00:28:38,172 --> 00:28:39,631
How do you figure that
from a guy

427
00:28:39,714 --> 00:28:42,839
who sells pickled cucumbers
and aftershave?

428
00:28:42,923 --> 00:28:44,464
It's queer from both sides.

429
00:28:44,547 --> 00:28:45,923
And the baby.

430
00:28:46,964 --> 00:28:50,589
Someone stood over Charlie
and stitched those eyes.

431
00:28:54,005 --> 00:28:55,673
Yeah, it's a dark tone,

432
00:28:55,756 --> 00:28:58,255
long, long, deep, dark tone.

433
00:29:01,589 --> 00:29:03,881
Wipe it off, gentles.

434
00:29:03,964 --> 00:29:05,547
We do what we're asked to do.

435
00:29:05,631 --> 00:29:07,881
Well, that's easy for you
to say.

436
00:29:07,964 --> 00:29:10,148
Detectives aren't gonna like me
over their shoulder on this.

437
00:29:10,172 --> 00:29:11,690
And I got a license
that could get pulled.

438
00:29:11,714 --> 00:29:12,981
So you don't want the job?

439
00:29:13,005 --> 00:29:15,422
Did I say that?

440
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:18,464
Bring me a signature
and a check.

441
00:29:21,964 --> 00:29:22,964
Cheer up.

442
00:29:23,005 --> 00:29:26,089
Someone might throw
a shoe at you.

443
00:29:26,172 --> 00:29:28,589
And you, get your hands
off my liquor and yourself

444
00:29:28,673 --> 00:29:30,673
down to the Angel's Flight
in the morning.

445
00:29:30,756 --> 00:29:32,547
Be my eyes, son.

446
00:29:33,089 --> 00:29:34,297
Time and a half.

447
00:29:34,381 --> 00:29:36,506
- It's New Year's Eve.
- Earn it.

448
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:15,923
Very good, papi.

449
00:30:20,673 --> 00:30:22,422
I think she's jealous of me.

450
00:30:27,756 --> 00:30:31,297
Did you bring
some more of that tequila?

451
00:30:31,381 --> 00:30:32,631
It's called mescal.

452
00:30:32,714 --> 00:30:34,839
And if you want some,
you better get it yourself.

453
00:30:34,964 --> 00:30:36,589
I ain't your fucking help.

454
00:30:45,422 --> 00:30:48,130
Either take them off
or put them back on, papi.

455
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:49,297
Make up your mind.

456
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:51,172
What are you in a rush for?

457
00:30:51,255 --> 00:30:53,881
- I need sleep.
- Sleep here.

458
00:30:53,964 --> 00:30:55,923
I sleep in my own bed.

459
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:00,964
I'll give you 6,000
for this dump.

460
00:31:01,047 --> 00:31:04,464
Six thousand
and she won't even sleep here.

461
00:31:05,214 --> 00:31:06,631
It's a fair price.

462
00:31:06,714 --> 00:31:08,089
It's a price.

463
00:31:08,172 --> 00:31:10,089
It's a great fucking price.

464
00:31:10,172 --> 00:31:11,756
You don't even have citrus.

465
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:13,506
You know I'm working this one.

466
00:31:13,589 --> 00:31:14,923
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

467
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:21,381
It's a big case.

468
00:31:21,464 --> 00:31:23,506
You don't usually do the bigs.

469
00:31:24,422 --> 00:31:25,673
I'm doing this one.

470
00:31:27,964 --> 00:31:29,631
Six thousand five hundred.

471
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:33,464
Enjoy your bed.

472
00:31:33,547 --> 00:31:34,673
I will.

473
00:31:46,297 --> 00:31:49,172
And right there,
in that very window,

474
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:52,047
sat the boy's parents.

475
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:55,547
Watching, hoping,
tragically unaware

476
00:31:55,631 --> 00:32:00,547
that their tiny innocent
was already ascending to heaven

477
00:32:00,631 --> 00:32:04,464
in the clutches of this demon.

478
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:07,339
This instrument of death.

479
00:32:08,297 --> 00:32:10,547
Thank you, ma'am.
Happy New Year, sir.

480
00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:42,756
Looking for something?

481
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:45,339
Close the blinds, Steve.

482
00:33:45,422 --> 00:33:48,506
Maybe I couldn't see him so good
and shot him by accident.

483
00:33:48,589 --> 00:33:52,005
Look, fellas,
if I... interrupted

484
00:33:52,089 --> 00:33:55,339
some sort of tender moment,
I sincerely apologize.

485
00:33:55,422 --> 00:33:56,464
Guy's a laugh riot.

486
00:33:56,547 --> 00:33:58,673
Take it easy with that thing.

487
00:33:58,756 --> 00:34:00,714
What the hell
are you doing here, Mason?

488
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:02,482
You gotta know something stinks
around Dodson

489
00:34:02,506 --> 00:34:03,673
or else you wouldn't be here.

490
00:34:03,756 --> 00:34:05,796
Get paid to look into things.
That's what I'm doing.

491
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:07,881
Hell with this.
We got him on a B&E.

492
00:34:07,964 --> 00:34:09,315
Let's run him in,
torch his license.

493
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:11,381
- Get the fuck off me!
- Settle down!

494
00:34:11,464 --> 00:34:13,297
Ease up, goddammit.

495
00:34:18,297 --> 00:34:19,732
You got something
says Dodson's clean,

496
00:34:19,756 --> 00:34:21,964
you'll be doing him a favor
by letting us know.

497
00:34:23,964 --> 00:34:27,839
Tiny innocent
was already ascending to heaven.

498
00:34:30,089 --> 00:34:32,381
Right after the Dodsons
found little Charlie dead,

499
00:34:32,464 --> 00:34:34,184
a green Phaeton goes
tearing up Hill Street,

500
00:34:34,214 --> 00:34:35,422
clipped the trolley.

501
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,714
You think that's our kidnapper?

502
00:34:37,798 --> 00:34:39,506
Where did you get
this Phaeton shit?

503
00:34:39,589 --> 00:34:41,381
Traffic cop working
the bottom of the flight.

504
00:34:41,464 --> 00:34:43,023
He didn't think anything of it
at the time

505
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:44,339
because most cops are stupid.

506
00:34:46,422 --> 00:34:47,673
Go check it out.

507
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:01,714
Your ape almost broke my camera.

508
00:35:01,798 --> 00:35:03,798
My ape would've broke your jaw.

509
00:35:03,881 --> 00:35:05,130
- Here.
- What's that?

510
00:35:05,214 --> 00:35:06,714
For the car thing.

511
00:35:06,798 --> 00:35:08,589
Save it
for a better sketch artist.

512
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,631
Man in hat?
That sure narrows it down.

513
00:35:10,714 --> 00:35:13,881
What about the guy on the phone
or the one in the car?

514
00:35:13,964 --> 00:35:15,422
Halfway to Rio is my guess.

515
00:35:15,506 --> 00:35:17,130
Is that why
you like Dodson for it?

516
00:35:17,214 --> 00:35:18,506
Got to arrest somebody.

517
00:35:18,589 --> 00:35:21,589
So you tie him up in a bow and
put yourself up for promotion.

518
00:35:21,673 --> 00:35:23,547
- That's tidy.
- Listen to you,

519
00:35:23,631 --> 00:35:25,964
pissing on my five bucks
because some sap thinks

520
00:35:26,047 --> 00:35:28,130
you can play cop?

521
00:35:28,214 --> 00:35:30,673
I already got the entire city
standing on my neck.

522
00:35:30,756 --> 00:35:32,357
So you enjoy the view
while you're up here

523
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:35,631
with the real police
because I'm gonna nail Dodson.

524
00:35:35,714 --> 00:35:37,673
And when I do,
you're back on the bottom,

525
00:35:37,756 --> 00:35:40,214
feeding off runaways
and cheaters.

526
00:35:40,881 --> 00:35:42,381
Lock up when you leave.

527
00:35:47,881 --> 00:35:49,547
Tragically unaware

528
00:35:49,631 --> 00:35:52,839
their tiny innocent
was already ascending to heaven.

529
00:36:16,172 --> 00:36:17,297
Mason here, any messages?

530
00:36:17,381 --> 00:36:18,923
Mr. Strickland called, read me

531
00:36:19,005 --> 00:36:21,381
three paragraphs of something
called Lipstick Girl,

532
00:36:21,464 --> 00:36:22,839
I did not write them down.

533
00:36:22,923 --> 00:36:23,923
Anything else?

534
00:36:24,005 --> 00:36:25,255
Just Walt LeBaron.

535
00:36:25,339 --> 00:36:27,023
Hammersmith Pictures requests
the honor of your presence

536
00:36:27,047 --> 00:36:28,214
at his New Year's party.

537
00:36:28,297 --> 00:36:30,547
Two tickets for you at the
door, business to discuss.

538
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,172
All right. Thanks, Irma.

539
00:36:32,255 --> 00:36:33,756
Diane, goddammit.

540
00:36:34,589 --> 00:36:35,923
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

541
00:36:39,589 --> 00:36:42,798
We got five minutes
and you owe me four bucks.

542
00:36:43,464 --> 00:36:44,673
You said two.

543
00:36:44,756 --> 00:36:46,339
Two for him, two for me.

544
00:36:46,422 --> 00:36:47,631
That's four.

545
00:37:00,547 --> 00:37:01,631
Happy New Year.

546
00:38:30,714 --> 00:38:32,464
<i>♪ It makes no difference ♪</i>

547

549
00:38:40,964 --> 00:38:42,798
What the fuck am I doing here?

550
00:38:42,881 --> 00:38:44,005
You're getting paid.

551
00:38:50,047 --> 00:38:51,589
Looks like Groucho Marx.

552
00:38:53,547 --> 00:38:57,089
Lovely ladies, kind gentlemen,
welcome.

553
00:38:57,172 --> 00:39:01,130
1931 was gangbusters
for Hammersmith Pictures.

554
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:04,172
1932 is gonna be even better

555
00:39:04,255 --> 00:39:07,923
because the brightest stars
in the sky live right here,

556
00:39:08,005 --> 00:39:10,506
- Mr. Dusty Rogers...
- Oh, shit.

557
00:39:10,589 --> 00:39:11,839
Hero of the prairies.

558
00:39:13,589 --> 00:39:15,005
Shorter than I thought.

559
00:39:15,089 --> 00:39:17,172
They must use really
small horses in the movies.

560
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:19,714
Ladies, how do you
like the continental...

561
00:39:19,798 --> 00:39:22,464
Hey... What are you gonna do
with your 300?

562
00:39:22,547 --> 00:39:24,339
I'm gonna get
a new pair of shoes.

563
00:39:24,422 --> 00:39:26,255
Maybe somewhat...
Are you listening to me?

564
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:27,339
Mm-hmm.

565
00:39:27,422 --> 00:39:29,673
I say something,
then you say something,

566
00:39:29,756 --> 00:39:31,756
that's how conversation works,
Perry.

567
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,839
He's scaring the Jesus
out of me right now.

568
00:39:34,923 --> 00:39:37,339
Mr. Petre Lupu.

569
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:44,536
I don't think you're getting
into the spirit of the thing.

570
00:39:45,798 --> 00:39:47,506
I saw the kid, Pete.

571
00:39:48,964 --> 00:39:50,005
The thread.

572
00:39:51,339 --> 00:39:53,089
- You all right?
- Yeah.

573
00:39:53,172 --> 00:39:54,940
If you should be
happening to be living

574
00:39:54,964 --> 00:39:56,631
- next to Miss America.
- Yeah.

575
00:39:58,297 --> 00:40:00,940
I call her the
sweetest piece of strudel I've ever seen.

576
00:40:00,964 --> 00:40:01,964
I'll be back.

577
00:40:02,005 --> 00:40:06,047
But you're gonna
call her Red, Miss Velma Fuller.

578
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:12,089
Oh, just a little, right there.

579
00:40:12,172 --> 00:40:15,172
Oh, I'm sorry, Clara,
I can't help myself.

580
00:40:15,255 --> 00:40:17,047
Anyway, listen.
Happy New Year...

581
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,214
No champagne tonight?

582
00:40:18,297 --> 00:40:19,964
Just the cash, Walt.

583
00:40:21,631 --> 00:40:23,673
Can we do it this year?

584
00:40:23,756 --> 00:40:26,047
Go see a Hammersmith Picture.
Thank you all.

585
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,798
Okay, Mason.

586
00:40:27,881 --> 00:40:29,756
Okay. Let's get you paid.

587
00:40:50,506 --> 00:40:52,172
You know what we have here?

588
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:54,506
Plenty of nothing?

589
00:40:54,589 --> 00:40:56,190
Ten thousand square foot of it.

590
00:40:56,214 --> 00:40:59,589
Why? Because I'm waiting
on a ten-million-dollar line

591
00:40:59,673 --> 00:41:01,214
of credit from the Irving Trust.

592
00:41:02,214 --> 00:41:03,881
I liked it better
when we were bandits

593
00:41:03,964 --> 00:41:06,506
on the land from the picture
patents company.

594
00:41:08,214 --> 00:41:09,547
Let's see what you got.

595
00:41:29,089 --> 00:41:31,589
With people starving
on breadlines.

596
00:41:33,547 --> 00:41:34,839
The negatives?

597
00:41:35,714 --> 00:41:37,214
They're somewhere safe.

598
00:41:37,297 --> 00:41:39,714
Oh, okay.

599
00:41:58,214 --> 00:42:01,089
Nice lighter.
Here's the thing

600
00:42:02,089 --> 00:42:03,631
we said 200.

601
00:42:03,714 --> 00:42:05,047
Six hundred is fair,

602
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:07,339
because I can get that
from the teller, easy.

603
00:42:07,422 --> 00:42:09,673
Let me tell you how I see it.

604
00:42:09,756 --> 00:42:11,839
People are desperate out there,
Mason.

605
00:42:11,923 --> 00:42:15,547
They're starving,
scared, hopeless.

606
00:42:15,631 --> 00:42:18,839
And for one little nickel,
what do we give them?

607
00:42:18,923 --> 00:42:21,005
The two hours in the dark,

608
00:42:21,089 --> 00:42:22,756
singing, dancing,

609
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:24,631
laughter, tears, romance

610
00:42:26,964 --> 00:42:27,964
hope.

611
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:32,005
And here you come
on New Year's Eve

612
00:42:32,089 --> 00:42:33,506
and what you wanna do

613
00:42:33,589 --> 00:42:37,506
is take these poor suffering
people's hope away

614
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:40,839
- for 400 measly bucks?
- I can be flexible on the price.

615
00:42:40,923 --> 00:42:42,506
It's not about the price.

616
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,673
It's the principle.

617
00:42:46,255 --> 00:42:47,297
So

618
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:51,506
200 like we agreed

619
00:42:52,214 --> 00:42:53,297
minus

620
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:59,339
199 for all the bullshit.

621
00:43:04,297 --> 00:43:06,506
You need to think
about your actions.

622
00:43:07,673 --> 00:43:10,214
You need to decide
what kind of person

623
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:12,506
you wanna be.

624
00:43:20,964 --> 00:43:22,464
And the negatives

625
00:43:22,547 --> 00:43:24,339
when you have a chance.

626
00:43:54,047 --> 00:43:55,881
Fuck!

627
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:15,130
You get it?
Did you get the 600?

628
00:44:15,214 --> 00:44:17,631
- There.
- The fuck is this, a dollar?

629
00:44:17,714 --> 00:44:19,839
- I think I overplayed it.
- Oh, no, Christ.

630
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:21,631
- No, no, no.
- I'm sorry, Pete.

631
00:44:21,714 --> 00:44:23,297
I got a family to feed.

632
00:44:29,089 --> 00:44:30,756
And fuck you!

633
00:44:49,047 --> 00:44:50,673
Relax, he'll be here.

634
00:44:50,756 --> 00:44:53,297
He got a hot date maybe?

635
00:44:53,381 --> 00:44:55,673
Uh-oh.
Touched a nerve.

636
00:44:55,756 --> 00:44:57,547
I'm starting to think
he doesn't like us.

637
00:44:57,631 --> 00:44:59,231
Why are you
still wearing that hat?

638
00:44:59,255 --> 00:45:01,506
Your picture's
on every front page in town.

639
00:45:01,589 --> 00:45:02,673
It's a fedora.

640
00:45:02,756 --> 00:45:05,130
One and half million
in Los Angeles.

641
00:45:05,214 --> 00:45:06,506
It looks good on me.

642
00:45:06,589 --> 00:45:08,297
None of this
was part of the plan.

643
00:45:08,381 --> 00:45:11,047
So jump off a pier
and swim to Tahiti.

644
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:12,172
I'll take your share.

645
00:45:12,255 --> 00:45:14,214
My share of what? A noose?

646
00:45:14,297 --> 00:45:16,422
No one's getting strung out.

647
00:45:22,839 --> 00:45:24,381
I should've run.

648
00:45:24,464 --> 00:45:27,089
The second I saw Charlie
done like that.

649
00:45:27,172 --> 00:45:28,923
His eyes, Jesus.

650
00:45:29,464 --> 00:45:30,547
I should've run.

651
00:45:30,631 --> 00:45:32,297
We all should have.

652
00:45:32,381 --> 00:45:34,798
But we didn't, did we, killer?

653
00:45:40,381 --> 00:45:43,422
Evening, gentlemen.
Sorry I'm late.

654
00:45:43,506 --> 00:45:46,673
Bunch of drunk Sambos blocking
up the road singing and dancing.

655
00:45:47,464 --> 00:45:48,631
Spooks were so fucking happy,

656
00:45:48,714 --> 00:45:51,005
I didn't have the heart
to crack any skulls.

657
00:45:51,089 --> 00:45:52,673
Let's get this over with.

658
00:45:52,756 --> 00:45:54,339
No Auld Lang Syne?

659
00:45:55,881 --> 00:45:56,881
Okay.

660
00:46:08,381 --> 00:46:09,756
What the fuck?

661
00:46:22,005 --> 00:46:23,297
They made the car.

662
00:46:49,673 --> 00:46:51,756
Fuck! Fuck!

663
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:54,089
Mailman said it's a stamp short,

664
00:47:54,172 --> 00:47:56,714
wants me to pay for it.
I said I'd love to pay for it

665
00:47:56,798 --> 00:47:58,964
except my bum of an ex
hasn't sent me money a month.

666
00:47:59,047 --> 00:48:01,089
Yeah, it's been tight, you know?

667
00:48:01,172 --> 00:48:02,798
I haven't... I don't know

668
00:48:02,881 --> 00:48:05,214
why the fuck I am arguing
with you about this,

669
00:48:05,297 --> 00:48:06,589
just put him on the phone.

670
00:48:06,673 --> 00:48:08,005
He's already in bed.

671
00:48:08,089 --> 00:48:09,130
Well, then, wake him up!

672
00:48:09,214 --> 00:48:10,547
I'm his... I'm his father.

673
00:48:10,631 --> 00:48:12,923
I get to talk to my son
on New Year's Eve.

674
00:48:13,005 --> 00:48:14,881
That was already last year.

675
00:48:14,964 --> 00:48:15,964
It's New Year's Day.

676
00:48:16,047 --> 00:48:17,964
Put him on the fucking
phone, Linda.

677
00:48:25,422 --> 00:48:28,089
How long have you
been standing there?

678
00:48:28,172 --> 00:48:31,381
Long enough to see
you make a jackass of yourself.

679
00:48:31,464 --> 00:48:33,631
She hung up on me.

680
00:48:33,714 --> 00:48:36,547
You never call the ex
on New Year's Eve, papi.

681
00:48:36,631 --> 00:48:37,881
Hello, operator?

682
00:48:37,964 --> 00:48:40,339
Could I get, um,
a long distance call?

683
00:48:40,422 --> 00:48:43,339
City of Salinas,
Axminster 7-7181.

684
00:48:43,422 --> 00:48:45,339
What the hell happened to you?

685
00:48:49,756 --> 00:48:52,297
All right. Well,
I was just on that line,

686
00:48:52,381 --> 00:48:54,673
it is... it is the number
of a heartless woman,

687
00:48:54,756 --> 00:48:57,089
but there is nothing wrong
with her ears,

688
00:48:57,172 --> 00:49:00,005
so keep it ringing.

689
00:49:00,089 --> 00:49:03,422
You know, my second husband
tracked me down to Caracas,

690
00:49:03,506 --> 00:49:05,881
I had to pull
my little .22 on him.

691
00:49:05,964 --> 00:49:08,089
They only shot the pendejo in...

692
00:49:08,172 --> 00:49:10,214
Just a little longer, please?

693
00:49:10,297 --> 00:49:12,964
Do you... Do you have kids,
operator?

694
00:49:13,047 --> 00:49:14,547
You have a heart?

695
00:49:16,422 --> 00:49:17,464
No heart.

696
00:49:21,506 --> 00:49:22,547
Listen.

697
00:49:24,631 --> 00:49:26,839
I'm flying straight to Oaxaca.

698
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,798
Knocking back some mescal,

699
00:49:29,881 --> 00:49:34,297
chewing on chapulines by sunset
next to someone dumb

700
00:49:34,381 --> 00:49:36,673
and good-looking next to me, so.

701
00:49:37,381 --> 00:49:38,881
I thought of you.

702
00:49:42,089 --> 00:49:44,547
Love, romance, excitement?

703
00:49:45,422 --> 00:49:47,005
Hmm.

704
00:49:47,089 --> 00:49:50,714
All of... All of life's
big thrills.

705
00:49:52,839 --> 00:49:56,047
Maybe you can get
cleaned up first.

706
00:49:58,923 --> 00:50:02,172
Everybody's up to something.

707
00:50:02,255 --> 00:50:06,547
Everybody's got an angle,
hiding something.

708
00:50:09,422 --> 00:50:12,589
And everybody is guilty.

709
00:50:37,673 --> 00:50:39,297
They don't make these things
so good.

710
00:50:54,631 --> 00:50:55,839
Poor papi.

711
00:51:02,172 --> 00:51:05,631
There is a black angel
out there.

712
00:51:06,255 --> 00:51:10,005
A big, big, black angel

713
00:51:10,673 --> 00:51:12,673
with long fingers.

714
00:51:20,297 --> 00:51:21,964
Oh, fuck.

715
00:53:47,881 --> 00:53:50,130
So you like turtles?

716
00:56:02,464 --> 00:56:04,384
The deck
was stacked from the start.

717
00:56:04,422 --> 00:56:06,881
Three guys, three stiffs.
According to the cops,

718
00:56:07,089 --> 00:56:09,214
- that's it.
- That seem likely to you?

719
00:56:10,923 --> 00:56:15,589
Charlie Dodson, may this temple
crumble if we fail you.

720
00:56:16,881 --> 00:56:18,714
No one wants this case.

721
00:56:21,881 --> 00:56:23,839
This one's really got its hooks
in me.

722
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:27,673
<i>♪ Wade in the water ♪</i>

723
00:56:27,756 --> 00:56:30,381
Someone under our roof,
capable of such acts of evil,

724
00:56:30,464 --> 00:56:32,547
- it has shaken our church.
- It's shaken all of us.

725
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:34,273
The district attorney

726
00:56:34,297 --> 00:56:35,881
is eyeballing the mayor's seat.

727
00:56:35,964 --> 00:56:37,631
We're gonna run him over
like a streetcar.

728
00:56:37,964 --> 00:56:40,148
The perpetrators
will be quickly put down.

729
00:56:40,172 --> 00:56:41,798
Justice for Charlie Dodson!

730
00:56:41,964 --> 00:56:45,047

Mr. Mason's evidence
is coming up short.

732
00:56:48,339 --> 00:56:50,089
You're pulling this out
of your ass, boy-o.

733
00:56:50,172 --> 00:56:51,464
Oh, that I agree with.

734
00:56:51,547 --> 00:56:53,631
The cops barely investigated
the case.

735
00:56:53,714 --> 00:56:56,964
- I'm the lawyer here!
- Then act like one, goddammit!

736
00:56:57,339 --> 00:56:58,631
This case is getting to you.

737
00:56:58,964 --> 00:57:01,464
You're a detective,
did I hear wrong, Mr. Mason?

738
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:06,047
You guys are breaking
so many laws right now.

739
00:57:10,047 --> 00:57:13,297
- This is over!
- I'm not done yet!

740
00:57:14,923 --> 00:57:16,203
The hell are you doing here?

741
00:57:16,631 --> 00:57:17,964
Just looking for justice.

1
00:00:00,984 --> 00:00:02,570
I'm truly sorry

2
00:00:02,898 --> 00:00:05,664
for bringing my former friend
to Firehouse 51.

3
00:00:05,695 --> 00:00:07,728
I feel terrible about what happened.

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,897
The problem with some
of the people that come in...

5
00:00:09,899 --> 00:00:12,333
Hey, hey, that's enough.
Come on, that's it.

6
00:00:14,871 --> 00:00:17,150
Not like this.

7
00:00:17,175 --> 00:00:19,342
- You're...
- Lily. You own a bar too?

8
00:00:19,377 --> 00:00:20,409
<i>What if we partner with it?</i>

9
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:23,045
I call it Molly's North.

10
00:00:23,047 --> 00:00:24,613
<i>You deserve better than I can give you.</i>

11
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:28,117
I got a job that's never
gonna be able to put you first.

12
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:30,449
- I'm on probation at work.
- Are you kidding me?

13
00:00:30,496 --> 00:00:32,529
It's all fair game
as long as Ramon Dawson

14
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:33,864
gets what he wants.

15
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:36,533
You only think about yourself
and I'm sick of it.

16
00:00:36,535 --> 00:00:38,368
Don't move! We got you.

17
00:00:40,339 --> 00:00:42,672
Dad.

18
00:00:42,674 --> 00:00:44,407
You're all right, Dad.

19
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:46,676
Just breathe nice and easy, in and out.

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,180
We need to apply
more pressure on his wounds.

21
00:00:50,182 --> 00:00:53,183
I've got him, just get us there, okay?

22
00:01:00,526 --> 00:01:02,859
Gabby. Gabby.

23
00:01:04,428 --> 00:01:06,630
Get behind the wheel.

24
00:01:26,785 --> 00:01:28,451
Hey Ramon, Gabby's still here,

25
00:01:28,453 --> 00:01:30,587
she's just driving us
to the hospital, okay?

26
00:01:36,727 --> 00:01:37,928
What's our ETA?

27
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,430
Three minutes.

28
00:01:44,303 --> 00:01:45,802
Whoa!

29
00:01:47,973 --> 00:01:49,806
Damn it.

30
00:01:49,808 --> 00:01:52,342
Taking another route.

31
00:02:03,655 --> 00:02:05,488
His O2 sats are dropping.

32
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,790
What's going on?

33
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:09,326
He's got a tension pneumothorax.

34
00:02:09,328 --> 00:02:10,660
I'm pulling over.

35
00:02:10,662 --> 00:02:13,930
No, I've got this, keep driving.

36
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:32,449
All right, I've got it.

37
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:34,951
Sats are coming up.

38
00:02:34,953 --> 00:02:36,786
86...

39
00:02:36,788 --> 00:02:38,955
90...

40
00:02:38,957 --> 00:02:40,991
We're one minute away.

41
00:02:42,526 --> 00:02:43,660
Incoming.

42
00:02:43,662 --> 00:02:45,028
Brett, Dawson, talk to me.

43
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,963
Victim is age 60, multiple stab wounds

44
00:02:46,965 --> 00:02:47,964
to the chest and back.

45
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:49,633
Decompressed in the rig.

46
00:02:49,635 --> 00:02:51,301
All right, I've got it,
let's get him to Baghdad.

47
00:02:51,303 --> 00:02:53,370
Let's stabilize him
and get him to surgery,

48
00:02:53,372 --> 00:02:55,505
Dr. Rhodes is waiting. Rotate!

49
00:02:55,507 --> 00:02:58,008
We'll transfer him on my count.

50
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,310
Here we go.

51
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:02,979
One, two, three, transfer.

52
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:07,350
Let's get this out. All right.

53
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:15,358
The patient is my dad.

54
00:03:16,527 --> 00:03:18,528
I know. We got him, Gabby.

55
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,864
Let's go, let's move, move, move.

56
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:29,072
He's gonna be all right.

57
00:03:29,074 --> 00:03:32,008
He's strong, like you.

58
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,361
- Gabby.
- Matt.

59
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:52,762
He's gonna be okay.

60
00:03:52,764 --> 00:03:55,532
Dr. Rhodes is the best in Chicago.

61
00:03:55,534 --> 00:03:56,599
Hey.

62
00:03:56,601 --> 00:03:58,068
How is he?

63
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,104
I don't know yet. He's in surgery.

64
00:04:01,106 --> 00:04:03,440
What happened on that platform?

65
00:04:03,442 --> 00:04:05,108
A guy was some kind of psycho,

66
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,043
screaming about his manifesto.

67
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:08,578
Then suddenly, he pulls out a knife

68
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,113
and starts slashing people.

69
00:04:10,115 --> 00:04:12,916
And apparently, dad stepped in
to try to stop him.

70
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:14,751
Bastard.

71
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:17,087
Yeah.

72
00:04:19,957 --> 00:04:22,892
Um, I'm sorry,
I didn't bring you a coffee.

73
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:25,562
That's all right,
I'm wired enough as it is.

74
00:04:25,564 --> 00:04:26,896
It's good to see you.

75
00:04:26,898 --> 00:04:28,131
If it wasn't for Brett,
Dad wouldn't have

76
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:30,600
made it to surgery.

77
00:04:32,737 --> 00:04:34,804
So, we did have to perform

78
00:04:34,806 --> 00:04:36,473
a thoracotomy on your father.

79
00:04:36,475 --> 00:04:39,075
Luckily, none of
the major vessels were injured

80
00:04:39,077 --> 00:04:41,644
so I sewed up
the laceration in his lung,

81
00:04:41,646 --> 00:04:44,447
repaired some of the damage.
He's gonna be okay.

82
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:46,916
What'd I tell you?

83
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:48,918
It's gonna take a lot more than
some L train psycho

84
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,787
to bring Ramon Dawson down.

85
00:04:52,758 --> 00:04:54,457
- Can we see him?
- Sure.

86
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:56,793
But just for a minute,
he's got to get his rest.

87
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:13,009
Hey, Dad.

88
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:14,811
You look all right.

89
00:05:14,813 --> 00:05:18,681
You look like you went a few
extra round with Mayweather.

90
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:25,121
What were you doing throwing
yourself in front of a knife?

91
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,794
Hey, save your strength, Pop.

92
00:05:30,796 --> 00:05:33,530
Doc says you're going to
be back to good in no time.

93
00:05:33,532 --> 00:05:36,032
Then the rest of the hoodlums
in Chicago better look out.

94
00:05:43,874 --> 00:05:46,543
Dawson is coming in for shift today.

95
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:47,811
Says she needs the distraction.

96
00:05:47,813 --> 00:05:50,647
Psh, I don't blame her.

97
00:05:52,049 --> 00:05:54,609
I'm sorry about the other day.

98
00:05:55,153 --> 00:05:57,654
I'm sorry for bringing
Hope here in the first place.

99
00:05:57,656 --> 00:06:00,023
What happened is on her, not you.

100
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,241
You left pretty early.

101
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:10,567
I had stuff to do.

102
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:12,902
I have a life, the gym...

103
00:06:12,904 --> 00:06:14,604
Stuff.

104
00:06:16,006 --> 00:06:17,740
Um...

105
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:19,643
- what was that?
- What?

106
00:06:19,902 --> 00:06:21,510
Just the way you were talking to him.

107
00:06:21,535 --> 00:06:24,858
- The awkward thing.
- It's awkward?

108
00:06:24,883 --> 00:06:27,717
Fine, I kissed him.

109
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:29,085
What?

110
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:31,020
- Don't yell at me.
- I'm not yelling.

111
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:32,922
It happened the other night
when I was hammered,

112
00:06:32,924 --> 00:06:34,524
and I've been trying
to avoid him ever since,

113
00:06:34,526 --> 00:06:36,559
Which isn't easy when you live together.

114
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:38,728
And now he probably thinks

115
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,763
that I still have a thing for him.

116
00:06:40,765 --> 00:06:43,233
Well...

117
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:46,736
I really need to get a life.

118
00:06:50,274 --> 00:06:53,042
Antonio was at the hospital.

119
00:06:53,044 --> 00:06:55,879
It was really nice to see him,
I'm just not sure if...

120
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:58,715
Do not kiss him.

121
00:06:58,717 --> 00:07:02,051
You will deeply, deeply regret it.

122
00:07:02,053 --> 00:07:04,220
Well...

123
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,892
You sure about working?

124
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:10,727
I'm the captain,
I can get you a sub right now.

125
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:12,629
I'm sure. He's out of IC,

126
00:07:12,631 --> 00:07:15,598
and how much time can I spend
at the hospital anyway?

127
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,300
I'll visit him at our first ambo drop.

128
00:07:17,302 --> 00:07:19,802
- Okay.
- Dawson.

129
00:07:19,804 --> 00:07:21,905
Please give your father
our best thoughts and prayers

130
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:24,140
for a speedy recovery.

131
00:07:24,142 --> 00:07:26,075
I will. Thanks, Chief.

132
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:27,911
There aren't a lot
of people out of uniform

133
00:07:27,913 --> 00:07:29,312
who would do what he did.

134
00:07:29,314 --> 00:07:30,847
Yeah. Brave guy.

135
00:07:34,952 --> 00:07:38,087
You coming to this Molly's
North meeting that Otis set up?

136
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:40,657
I pulled the injured dad card.

137
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:42,158
Kidd's covering me.

138
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,128
Lucky you.

139
00:07:46,931 --> 00:07:49,933
Okay, Molly's North.

140
00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:52,669
Whoa, who's the artist?

141
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:55,104
I drew them, but I'm no artist.

142
00:07:55,106 --> 00:07:57,340
Are you kidding me? Look at these.

143
00:07:57,342 --> 00:08:00,343
Right? Isn't she incredible?

144
00:08:00,345 --> 00:08:03,680
We're having
a Molly's North meeting.

145
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:05,148
Cool.

146
00:08:05,816 --> 00:08:08,818
Looks like quite a makeover.

147
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,954
Well, you know,
Mac's went out of business,

148
00:08:10,956 --> 00:08:13,690
So we can't just
slap a new sign out front.

149
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:15,858
We have to give it a facelift,
let the world know

150
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,161
that it's something new.

151
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:24,200
Okay. I know that this is a partnership,

152
00:08:24,202 --> 00:08:26,970
but this new location was my idea,

153
00:08:26,972 --> 00:08:29,806
and I have kind of a vision
for how to do it.

154
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:32,342
So, why don't you let me
run point on this?

155
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:40,383
So long as it's a money maker,

156
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:44,020
and not a money drainer,

157
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:45,888
go with God.

158
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,891
That's the plan.

159
00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:50,893
So you're going to handle everything?

160
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:53,863
The opening, arranging the publicity.

161
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:55,999
Yeah.

162
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:59,168
No sweat.

163
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,170
<i>Truck 81, Ambulance 61,</i>

164
00:09:01,172 --> 00:09:03,406
Whoops. We got to go save some lives.

165
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:06,843
- We'll regroup later, okay?
- Okay.

166
00:09:09,014 --> 00:09:11,247
I never said thank you.

167
00:09:11,249 --> 00:09:13,216
What?

168
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:16,919
You saved my dad's life,
and I didn't say thank you.

169
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:18,354
Come on, Dawson,

170
00:09:18,356 --> 00:09:20,757
you don't have to thank me for that.

171
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,425
Yeah, I do.

172
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:26,929
And when my dad
starts driving me crazy again,

173
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:28,398
I can blame you.

174
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,625
It's good to see Antonio again.

175
00:09:35,205 --> 00:09:37,040
Here we go.

176
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,220
- Hey.
- Yup?

177
00:09:51,222 --> 00:09:53,389
Hey, I feel stupid calling you guys,

178
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:54,957
but something ain't right here.

179
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,259
Let's take a look.

180
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,097
It's right through here.

181
00:10:03,068 --> 00:10:04,967
Yeah, that's not supposed to happen.

182
00:10:04,969 --> 00:10:06,469
Looks like a shorted circuit.

183
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:08,237
Could be an electrical fire somewhere.

184
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:10,306
Whoa!

185
00:10:10,308 --> 00:10:13,142
You know, it's probably
that old nut in 1C.

186
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:14,811
He's tripping breakers all the time,

187
00:10:14,813 --> 00:10:16,145
God knows what he does in there.

188
00:10:16,147 --> 00:10:17,914
Okay, let's find this fire quick.

189
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,950
Herrmann, Otis, check out apartment 1C.

190
00:10:22,453 --> 00:10:25,321
Fire department.

191
00:10:25,323 --> 00:10:28,091
- I'm smelling smoke.
- Yeah, me too.

192
00:10:28,093 --> 00:10:30,493
Hey, we got smoke in unit
1C, we're gonna force entry.

193
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:31,828
<i>Copy that, Otis.</i>

194
00:10:34,865 --> 00:10:37,400
Fire department, call out.

195
00:10:39,436 --> 00:10:41,104
What the hell?

196
00:10:48,979 --> 00:10:50,813
Fire department!

197
00:10:54,284 --> 00:10:57,053
Hey, got somebody!

198
00:11:04,752 --> 00:11:06,837
- Right over here, guys.
- Found him unconscious,

199
00:11:06,862 --> 00:11:08,087
with shallow breathing.

200
00:11:08,229 --> 00:11:09,850
No apparent trauma involved.

201
00:11:09,975 --> 00:11:11,330
I'll get him some oxygen.

202
00:11:11,355 --> 00:11:12,687
Let's get a pulseox on him,

203
00:11:12,689 --> 00:11:14,129
cardiac monitor and check his sugar.

204
00:11:20,364 --> 00:11:21,363
There it is.

205
00:11:21,365 --> 00:11:23,265
Okay. Kidd.

206
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:25,400
Here you go, Chief.

207
00:11:31,105 --> 00:11:32,472
Okay, hit it.

208
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,250
Yup, it's out.

209
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,755
Damn.

210
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,720
What the hell happened to you?

211
00:11:49,894 --> 00:11:51,901
What's that, Chief?

212
00:12:01,673 --> 00:12:02,838
We're going to take good care of you,

213
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,507
get you to the hospital.

214
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:06,909
I've got no insurance.

215
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:09,712
You can sort that out later.
You need medical attention.

216
00:12:09,714 --> 00:12:12,014
But I got no insurance.

217
00:12:12,016 --> 00:12:15,418
Don't give these ladies
a hard time now, Stoke.

218
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,420
They're going to take care of you.

219
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:40,876
- Hey, mind if I...
- Of course.

220
00:12:40,878 --> 00:12:43,579
Yeah, check on your dad, I got this.

221
00:12:45,615 --> 00:12:47,750
Wow.

222
00:12:47,752 --> 00:12:49,418
Look at this, <i>mija.</i>

223
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,788
That one over there
is from the TV station.

224
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,958
That big one there,
that's from the mayor's office.

225
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,060
That's great, Dad.

226
00:12:58,062 --> 00:12:59,562
A lot of people are proud of you.

227
00:12:59,564 --> 00:13:02,431
Yeah. Your mom came visiting me.

228
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:03,799
Yeah, she told me.

229
00:13:03,801 --> 00:13:06,469
I've been trying to get that woman

230
00:13:06,471 --> 00:13:09,739
to call me back for a year.

231
00:13:09,741 --> 00:13:12,475
Turns out, all I had to do was

232
00:13:12,477 --> 00:13:14,910
get stabbed a few times.

233
00:13:16,581 --> 00:13:19,148
That was a joke.
Look... hey, look at this.

234
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,651
I got all these interviews
with some newspapers

235
00:13:22,653 --> 00:13:25,588
and other television stations.

236
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,923
Didn't Dr. Rhodes
say you needed to get rest?

237
00:13:27,925 --> 00:13:31,127
Yes, he did, but he also said
that I'm going to be all right.

238
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:33,829
You'll be all right with rest and rehab.

239
00:13:33,831 --> 00:13:35,931
- Yup.
- Promise.

240
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:38,467
I cross my heart.

241
00:13:39,836 --> 00:13:42,605
Look at that.

242
00:13:42,607 --> 00:13:44,673
That looks like somebody
pulled up a whole garden.

243
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,143
Okay, I got to get back to work.

244
00:13:47,145 --> 00:13:48,511
I'll stop by after shift, okay.

245
00:13:48,513 --> 00:13:50,980
- Okay. Love you.
- Love you.

246
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,618
What?

247
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,486
Yeah, dude. Dig in.

248
00:13:57,488 --> 00:13:58,788
Man. Maybe we should give

249
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,122
brownies away at the opening,

250
00:14:00,124 --> 00:14:01,624
that'd get people through the door.

251
00:14:01,626 --> 00:14:03,526
Hey, I was thinking.

252
00:14:03,528 --> 00:14:04,960
My old neighbor, Julius,

253
00:14:04,962 --> 00:14:07,463
he sells taxi top advertising.

254
00:14:07,465 --> 00:14:08,798
You know those signs on top of cabs?

255
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,866
- Sure.
- So I asked Julius,

256
00:14:10,868 --> 00:14:13,969
and he said he can do a rate
of 250 bucks a top for you.

257
00:14:13,971 --> 00:14:15,805
Sounds pretty reasonable.

258
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,807
Thanks, Cruz, I would have
never thought of that.

259
00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:20,009
I know how much this bar means to you.

260
00:14:20,977 --> 00:14:23,546
Hey, you know what,
tell Julius we're in.

261
00:14:23,548 --> 00:14:25,514
- All right.
- Let's do this.

262
00:14:25,516 --> 00:14:26,715
Whoa.

263
00:14:26,717 --> 00:14:28,184
Are those Cindy Herrmann brownies?

264
00:14:28,186 --> 00:14:30,219
Annabelle Herrmann brownies.

265
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:32,488
Are these gummy worms?

266
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,657
Yep.

267
00:14:47,904 --> 00:14:49,872
So, everything good

268
00:14:49,874 --> 00:14:52,241
- with you and Kidd?
- Yeah, she's the best.

269
00:14:52,243 --> 00:14:55,744
You haven't noticed her acting a...

270
00:14:55,746 --> 00:14:58,080
a little off?

271
00:14:58,082 --> 00:15:01,517
I think she's maybe riding
herself a little hard

272
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,552
for the other night,
when she had a few too many.

273
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:06,222
Might have done some things she regrets.

274
00:15:06,224 --> 00:15:08,090
You tell her not to worry about it?

275
00:15:08,092 --> 00:15:10,025
Well, I'm going to let her sort it out.

276
00:15:10,027 --> 00:15:13,095
If she wants to talk
to me about it, she will.

277
00:15:13,097 --> 00:15:15,197
Okay.

278
00:15:24,274 --> 00:15:25,875
You clean these last Sunday?

279
00:15:25,877 --> 00:15:28,043
- Yeah.
- Sunday or the Sunday before?

280
00:15:28,045 --> 00:15:29,612
- Casey.
- Yeah?

281
00:15:29,614 --> 00:15:31,881
When 61 gets back,
send them my way, would you?

282
00:15:31,883 --> 00:15:34,049
I'm curious about
the old man's condition.

283
00:15:34,051 --> 00:15:36,285
Sure thing, Chief.

284
00:15:36,287 --> 00:15:39,255
Why do you suppose
he had all those humidifiers?

285
00:15:39,257 --> 00:15:41,757
Probably a lung thing.

286
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,059
My Uncle Ricky, lifelong smoker,

287
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:47,229
he couldn't survive without
a humidifier toward the end.

288
00:15:47,231 --> 00:15:49,231
That's not right.

289
00:15:49,233 --> 00:15:51,600
He was too good to end up like that.

290
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:53,602
Uncle Ricky?

291
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:55,604
No, the guy we pulled
out of that apartment.

292
00:15:55,606 --> 00:15:57,773
Why, who is he?

293
00:15:57,775 --> 00:15:59,775
Stoke Porter.

294
00:15:59,777 --> 00:16:01,977
South Side Stoke?

295
00:16:01,979 --> 00:16:03,979
Legend of the blues harmonica?

296
00:16:03,981 --> 00:16:05,314
Never heard of him.

297
00:16:05,316 --> 00:16:08,083
Then you need your horizons broadened.

298
00:16:08,085 --> 00:16:11,921
What do you say we reconvene
tomorrow night at my place

299
00:16:11,923 --> 00:16:15,090
for cigars, bourbon and blues?

300
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,760
Sounds good to me, Chief.

301
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:22,798
Well I'd have to run it by Trudy.

302
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:27,870
But yes, I will be there.

303
00:16:28,772 --> 00:16:30,639
Good.

304
00:16:32,943 --> 00:16:35,644
Why are you and me hanging
out at Boden's tomorrow night?

305
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:37,146
I don't know.

306
00:16:37,148 --> 00:16:38,847
But he seems to need it right now.

307
00:16:38,849 --> 00:16:40,883
So we're gonna do it.

308
00:16:43,853 --> 00:16:45,788
Friday is in four days.

309
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,957
You don't think that's a little soon

310
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:51,126
to transform Mac's into Molly's,

311
00:16:51,128 --> 00:16:53,329
stock the bar, get the drink
menus printed up,

312
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:55,831
and the advertising in place, et cetera?

313
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,167
I already got the advertising locked up.

314
00:16:58,169 --> 00:16:59,969
Great..

315
00:16:59,971 --> 00:17:02,705
Friday. Why Friday?

316
00:17:02,707 --> 00:17:04,807
Because Friday is the 9th.

317
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:06,308
And that's Lily's lucky number.

318
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,045
And she said that
Mercury is in retrograde.

319
00:17:10,047 --> 00:17:12,147
Or is it not in retrograde?
Which is the good one?

320
00:17:12,149 --> 00:17:15,050
Otis, you have to open big,

321
00:17:15,052 --> 00:17:18,687
or this bar is never
going to get off the ground.

322
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:20,356
I got this.

323
00:17:23,828 --> 00:17:25,160
How are you going to stand there

324
00:17:25,162 --> 00:17:26,829
and let him run point on this?

325
00:17:26,831 --> 00:17:28,897
He's just trying to impress Lily,

326
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:31,834
who's... never going to sleep with him

327
00:17:31,836 --> 00:17:33,168
by the way.

328
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,004
No, he's right. This is his idea.

329
00:17:35,006 --> 00:17:37,740
I've ridden him enough in this life.

330
00:17:37,742 --> 00:17:41,877
I see, not caring.

331
00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:44,380
Well, this is a new attitude

332
00:17:44,382 --> 00:17:48,751
that I am also going
to apply to my life.

333
00:18:01,612 --> 00:18:03,146
Antonio.

334
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:09,038
It occurred to me you left
your sweatshirt at my place.

335
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,106
It says "Diego."

336
00:18:11,108 --> 00:18:13,042
Really?

337
00:18:14,912 --> 00:18:17,146
It doesn't look like his size.

338
00:18:21,051 --> 00:18:24,286
Would you like to come in?

339
00:18:24,288 --> 00:18:26,055
I mean, sure.

340
00:18:32,129 --> 00:18:34,229
Where are the guys?

341
00:18:34,231 --> 00:18:37,066
They're at Molly's.

342
00:18:37,068 --> 00:18:39,401
How's your dad?

343
00:18:39,403 --> 00:18:41,804
He's enjoying the hell
out of his 15 minutes,

344
00:18:41,806 --> 00:18:43,305
that's for sure.

345
00:18:43,307 --> 00:18:45,407
He deserves it.

346
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,411
When I saw you at the hospital,

347
00:18:49,413 --> 00:18:51,914
I knew I was in trouble.

348
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:54,116
Antonio, I'm just not sure if...

349
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:02,991
I have more to say.

350
00:19:02,993 --> 00:19:05,094
I'm listening.

351
00:19:10,778 --> 00:19:13,011
This is not a good idea.

352
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,250
Maybe it's a onetime thing.

353
00:19:15,339 --> 00:19:16,939
A onetime thing?

354
00:19:16,941 --> 00:19:19,929
Yeah. There's no reason
to overthink it.

355
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,718
Okay.

356
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,713
What do you want me to say?

357
00:19:33,808 --> 00:19:35,127
I was headed home,

358
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,466
and there was this guy on the...

359
00:19:37,538 --> 00:19:39,037
when is this gonna air?

360
00:19:39,087 --> 00:19:40,921
We're doing a shoot here.

361
00:19:40,923 --> 00:19:43,089
Just gotta keep the hall clear.

362
00:19:44,459 --> 00:19:47,978
Sure, yeah, I'll just...
come back later.

363
00:19:48,017 --> 00:19:49,550
How long a segment is this going to be?

364
00:19:49,552 --> 00:19:52,320
You don't have
to worry about anything...

365
00:19:54,156 --> 00:19:56,324
So just give us a minute.

366
00:19:56,326 --> 00:19:57,525
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

367
00:19:59,195 --> 00:20:01,229
Otis. What are you doing here?

368
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:02,997
I thought you were painting
the Molly's North sign.

369
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:05,132
Yeah, I'm just waiting
for the first coat to dry.

370
00:20:05,134 --> 00:20:06,400
Listen, the distributor

371
00:20:06,402 --> 00:20:08,002
can't guarantee a delivery by Friday.

372
00:20:08,004 --> 00:20:10,761
So I figured I would just grab
a few cases from our stock.

373
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,168
You know, just some
of the well liquor, the basics.

374
00:20:13,193 --> 00:20:15,543
Hey, you got a little...

375
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:18,045
- What?
- Never mind.

376
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,413
Hey, did Julius get.

377
00:20:19,415 --> 00:20:21,182
Lily's artwork for the taxi tops?

378
00:20:21,184 --> 00:20:22,683
Yeah, yeah, and now,

379
00:20:22,685 --> 00:20:24,518
he needs a signature on this.

380
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,526
And a cashier's check for 25 grand.

381
00:20:28,191 --> 00:20:31,058
25... thousand?

382
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,194
Dollars?

383
00:20:34,397 --> 00:20:35,613
- Yeah.
- I thought you said

384
00:20:35,638 --> 00:20:38,773
that taxis were $250 a top.

385
00:20:38,775 --> 00:20:41,275
Yeah, with a minimum of 100 cabs.

386
00:20:41,277 --> 00:20:43,411
You never said that!

387
00:20:47,283 --> 00:20:48,916
Yeah, I was wondering where

388
00:20:48,918 --> 00:20:50,423
you were going to get
that kind of money.

389
00:20:50,447 --> 00:20:51,988
God.

390
00:20:52,074 --> 00:20:53,301
We're toast.

391
00:20:53,457 --> 00:20:55,590
We got zero publicity.

392
00:20:55,592 --> 00:20:57,326
Nothing!

393
00:21:00,965 --> 00:21:03,131
Okay, there's this guy at my gym

394
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:04,466
who's been hitting on me for months.

395
00:21:04,468 --> 00:21:06,927
He's a morning DJ at 95.8 FM.

396
00:21:07,137 --> 00:21:08,637
Maybe if I bat my eyelashes,

397
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:11,173
I could finagle
a little free press out of him.

398
00:21:11,175 --> 00:21:13,475
My God. Yes.

399
00:21:13,477 --> 00:21:15,013
Put me on the radio.

400
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:16,388
Put you on?

401
00:21:16,435 --> 00:21:18,680
I just thought that
maybe he could mention

402
00:21:18,682 --> 00:21:20,449
the Molly's North opening on the air.

403
00:21:20,451 --> 00:21:23,318
No, no, no, have you
never heard my podcast?

404
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,320
You just put me on the radio,

405
00:21:25,322 --> 00:21:27,656
and then just watch the magic happen.

406
00:21:29,025 --> 00:21:32,160
I'll, I'll see what I can do.

407
00:21:32,162 --> 00:21:33,328
Thank you.

408
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,297
This is gonna murder.

409
00:21:38,469 --> 00:21:40,369
Otis has a podcast?

410
00:21:45,175 --> 00:21:47,676
This is really good.

411
00:21:47,678 --> 00:21:49,711
So is this.

412
00:21:52,516 --> 00:21:54,716
You know, I can't help wondering,

413
00:21:54,718 --> 00:21:57,519
what good is a man's legacy?

414
00:21:57,521 --> 00:21:59,321
Take your fatherinlaw.

415
00:21:59,323 --> 00:22:01,056
Tried to help someone,
tried to do something good.

416
00:22:01,058 --> 00:22:03,692
Instead, he nearly dies
on a grimy train platform.

417
00:22:03,694 --> 00:22:07,195
Yeah, but he's
going to pull through fine.

418
00:22:11,335 --> 00:22:14,236
Stoke Porter.

419
00:22:14,238 --> 00:22:17,239
He brought life to this music.

420
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:19,207
He created art.

421
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:21,710
What thanks does he get?

422
00:22:21,712 --> 00:22:23,745
He ends up broke,

423
00:22:23,747 --> 00:22:26,381
sick...

424
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:30,352
Suffering alone.

425
00:22:36,392 --> 00:22:38,560
Where is that bottle?

426
00:22:42,231 --> 00:22:44,266
- What is happening?
- I have no idea.

427
00:22:44,268 --> 00:22:47,235
Just drink your bourbon,
let the man talk it out.

428
00:22:52,543 --> 00:22:55,243
You know, we should pay him a visit.

429
00:22:55,245 --> 00:22:57,412
What, Stoke?

430
00:22:57,414 --> 00:22:59,281
Let him know he's not forgotten.

431
00:22:59,283 --> 00:23:01,450
That's a fine idea.

432
00:23:05,621 --> 00:23:07,422
Wait, you mean right now?

433
00:23:07,424 --> 00:23:09,758
- Hey.
- Yeah, great, I'm in.

434
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,626
Pass me the album.

435
00:23:11,628 --> 00:23:13,762
- This guy?
- That one. Yep.

436
00:23:18,601 --> 00:23:21,603
Um, excuse me, we know it's late,

437
00:23:21,605 --> 00:23:25,574
but, we were hoping
to say hi to Stoke Porter.

438
00:23:25,576 --> 00:23:27,642
You mean Stanley Porter?

439
00:23:27,644 --> 00:23:31,279
Yes, ma'am. I guess so.

440
00:23:31,281 --> 00:23:32,814
You're not family, then.

441
00:23:32,816 --> 00:23:36,651
No, we were the firefighters
that brought him in.

442
00:23:38,155 --> 00:23:41,456
I'm sorry, Mr. Porter didn't make it.

443
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:49,164
That's terrible.

444
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:50,765
Yeah.

445
00:23:50,767 --> 00:23:53,935
His daughter flew in
from Dallas to see him, but...

446
00:23:53,937 --> 00:23:57,506
he didn't hang on long enough.

447
00:23:57,508 --> 00:24:00,809
I'm really sorry for your loss.

448
00:24:00,811 --> 00:24:03,478
Are you friends of my father's?

449
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,347
No, not really,

450
00:24:05,349 --> 00:24:07,949
we just had the pleasure of meeting him.

451
00:24:07,951 --> 00:24:10,852
Then you knew him
about as well as I did.

452
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:15,690
Stoke lived his own way, and
my mom had had enough of it.

453
00:24:15,692 --> 00:24:19,661
So she took me far away from my father.

454
00:24:19,663 --> 00:24:22,797
Now all I have left are his debts.

455
00:24:37,414 --> 00:24:39,034
Mitch and the guys
are on commercial break,

456
00:24:39,058 --> 00:24:41,197
so just come right in, get comfortable.

457
00:24:41,464 --> 00:24:43,331
- Okay.
- Thanks.

458
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,466
This is Mitch and the guys.

459
00:24:45,468 --> 00:24:46,968
- Hi!
- Hey, Stella.

460
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:49,170
Hi.

461
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:51,583
Hey, Mitch, just, thank you.

462
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:53,138
Thank you for letting us do this.

463
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:55,343
- Yeah no problem.
- This is Brian...

464
00:24:55,345 --> 00:24:56,678
From Molly's North.

465
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,179
- How you doing?
- Hey, Brian, man.

466
00:24:58,181 --> 00:24:59,531
Hey, there's your chair over there.

467
00:24:59,555 --> 00:25:01,422
Why don't you throw those headphones on

468
00:25:01,518 --> 00:25:03,404
and don't lean too
close to the mic, all right?

469
00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:05,353
It's okay, it's not my first rodeo.

470
00:25:05,355 --> 00:25:07,035
- All right, great!
<i>- All right, we're back</i>

471
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:10,208
<i>in five, four, three...</i>

472
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,195
All right, we've got
a guest in the studio today.

473
00:25:14,197 --> 00:25:17,018
Brian! Brian's here to
tell us about his cool new bar

474
00:25:17,065 --> 00:25:19,860
opening up in Bucktown tomorrow night.

475
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:22,458
What's the place called, Brian?

476
00:25:27,301 --> 00:25:29,526
The name of the bar, buddy,
what's the bar called?

477
00:25:29,551 --> 00:25:31,167
Sorry, it's called Mac's.

478
00:25:31,255 --> 00:25:33,784
No, it's not called Mac's.
Mac's actually closed down.

479
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:35,257
It's called...

480
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:37,262
Um...

481
00:25:38,059 --> 00:25:41,263
The excitement is building.

482
00:25:41,265 --> 00:25:43,565
Our listeners are sitting in their cars

483
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:47,769
right now, waiting
for you to say something.

484
00:25:47,771 --> 00:25:49,605
Anything, Brian!

485
00:25:49,607 --> 00:25:51,273
It's called Molly's...

486
00:25:53,711 --> 00:25:56,778
Sorry, buddy!

487
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,448
Sorry, sorry.
Go ahead Brian, I'm sorry man.

488
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,617
It's called Molly's...

489
00:26:04,221 --> 00:26:05,787
I got you, I got you.

490
00:26:05,789 --> 00:26:08,423
I'm sorry man, go ahead.

491
00:26:08,425 --> 00:26:10,626
- Are you ever gonna let me go?
- Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

492
00:26:10,628 --> 00:26:11,793
Molly's...

493
00:26:13,464 --> 00:26:16,298
Come on, it wasn't a total bust.

494
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,433
It's not a good promotion
if the people didn't even hear

495
00:26:18,435 --> 00:26:20,736
the name of the bar
over all the fart noises.

496
00:26:20,738 --> 00:26:23,639
Hey, your boyfriend
really screwed us over.

497
00:26:23,641 --> 00:26:25,607
A, not my boyfriend.

498
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:29,478
B, "Put me on the radio
and watch the magic happen."

499
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,946
Otis, dude, that was hilarious stuff.

500
00:26:30,948 --> 00:26:32,447
Shut up, Capp.

501
00:26:32,449 --> 00:26:34,750
God.

502
00:26:34,752 --> 00:26:36,418
The name of the bar is Molly's North.

503
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,654
I know! You don't
think I feel bad enough?

504
00:26:38,656 --> 00:26:40,489
That was humiliating.

505
00:26:40,491 --> 00:26:42,324
I'm just praying Lily didn't tune in.

506
00:26:44,495 --> 00:26:47,496
Yep, she did.

507
00:26:47,498 --> 00:26:50,532
Aw, she feels bad for me.

508
00:26:57,641 --> 00:26:59,975
Dawson.

509
00:26:59,977 --> 00:27:01,677
How's your dad doing?

510
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,679
Pretty good, actually.

511
00:27:03,681 --> 00:27:06,848
Handling it a lot better
than I am, that's for sure.

512
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:10,852
It's not easy
dealing with a hurting parent.

513
00:27:10,854 --> 00:27:14,356
Are you getting
enough time off to go see him?

514
00:27:14,358 --> 00:27:17,859
No, he's got
plenty of visitors right now.

515
00:27:17,861 --> 00:27:20,195
Reporters, wellwishers.

516
00:27:20,197 --> 00:27:22,831
Half the city's
been in his hospital room.

517
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:25,701
Well, I'm glad he's
getting some nice attention,

518
00:27:25,703 --> 00:27:28,870
but I'm sure he'd rather have you there.

519
00:27:28,872 --> 00:27:30,706
Maybe.

520
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:32,874
Definitely.

521
00:27:32,876 --> 00:27:34,876
I've met the man.

522
00:27:36,714 --> 00:27:39,881
I'll go by and see him after shift.

523
00:27:39,883 --> 00:27:42,217
Good.

524
00:27:42,219 --> 00:27:46,221
You know all these people
celebrating him...

525
00:27:46,223 --> 00:27:48,857
it's pretty amazing actually.

526
00:27:52,696 --> 00:27:54,830
<i>Squad Three, Ambulance 61,</i>

527
00:27:54,832 --> 00:27:57,499
<i>structure fire, 1400 Edgemont Ave.</i>

528
00:28:18,755 --> 00:28:20,589
- We miss all the excitement?
- Could be.

529
00:28:20,591 --> 00:28:22,424
We got everyone out
and knocked down the fire,

530
00:28:22,426 --> 00:28:24,426
but we're still waiting
to hear overhaul's complete.

531
00:28:24,428 --> 00:28:25,761
All right, we'll help you mop up.

532
00:28:25,763 --> 00:28:27,429
Hey, Cruz, you come with me.

533
00:28:27,431 --> 00:28:28,597
Tony, Capp, you guys sit tight a minute.

534
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:29,931
- Copy that.
- Anybody hurt?

535
00:28:29,933 --> 00:28:32,434
I don't think so, but ask around.

536
00:28:37,941 --> 00:28:39,775
Is everybody okay?

537
00:28:39,777 --> 00:28:43,445
Nobody's having trouble
breathing, no burns?

538
00:28:43,447 --> 00:28:44,780
Here honey, let's have a look.

539
00:28:44,782 --> 00:28:47,449
Hey! What are you doing there, hon?

540
00:28:47,451 --> 00:28:48,950
You got to stay clear of that building.

541
00:28:48,952 --> 00:28:50,585
I just left my purse inside.

542
00:28:50,587 --> 00:28:52,287
- Can I go grab it really quick?
- No, sorry, no.

543
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:53,455
There was a fire. Stay way back, please.

544
00:28:53,457 --> 00:28:55,624
Okay.

545
00:28:55,626 --> 00:28:57,592
Hey, Brett, let's
get some oxygen over here.

546
00:28:57,594 --> 00:28:59,795
Yeah, have a seat ma'am.

547
00:28:59,797 --> 00:29:02,097
Damn it. Brett, tell 37

548
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:03,932
we have a civilian going
in through the back.

549
00:29:03,934 --> 00:29:06,635
What? Where are you going?

550
00:29:16,446 --> 00:29:18,980
It's definitely a lot smokier back here.

551
00:29:18,982 --> 00:29:20,782
<i>Copy that, Severide.</i>

552
00:29:25,121 --> 00:29:26,755
Hey! You can't be in here.

553
00:29:26,757 --> 00:29:28,490
We got to get out of the building now.

554
00:29:28,492 --> 00:29:30,826
Yeah, here we go.

555
00:29:30,828 --> 00:29:33,595
We got a fire in the ceiling
in the back hallway.

556
00:29:33,597 --> 00:29:35,630
It's right by the central oxygen system.

557
00:29:35,632 --> 00:29:37,332
Kiddo, the fire
might not be out yet, let's go.

558
00:29:37,334 --> 00:29:39,968
- Wait, my bag's right here.
- Come on, we got to go.

559
00:29:40,837 --> 00:29:42,671
Dawson, what the hell?

560
00:29:42,673 --> 00:29:44,606
Get down!

561
00:29:58,726 --> 00:30:00,626
Dawson, what are you doing in here?

562
00:30:00,628 --> 00:30:03,062
Long story, help me get her out.

563
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:16,942
Come on, let's move.

564
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,753
This way!

565
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:56,730
Easy, easy now. You took a big bump.

566
00:30:56,731 --> 00:30:59,511
Just lay back,
let me take a look at you.

567
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,035
All right, how many fingers
am I holding up?

568
00:31:03,037 --> 00:31:04,036
Three.

569
00:31:04,038 --> 00:31:06,238
- Now?
- Two.

570
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,239
What's your name?

571
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:08,540
It's Bria.

572
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:10,542
Hi Bria. I'm Gabby.

573
00:31:18,052 --> 00:31:20,085
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

574
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,253
You had a loss of consciousness.

575
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:23,422
We're taking you to the hospital.

576
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:25,591
No, I'm telling you, I'm fine.

577
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:27,392
It's a bump.

578
00:31:27,394 --> 00:31:30,596
Please let me go home.

579
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:33,198
I put the drugs back.

580
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,703
Why?

581
00:31:40,406 --> 00:31:43,942
I'm not sure.

582
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:45,444
Hey, Brett, let's get her inside.

583
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:48,280
- Okay, one sec.
- Um...

584
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:51,617
They weren't for me.

585
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:54,253
Okay.

586
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:02,461
Otis, why am I getting an alert

587
00:32:02,463 --> 00:32:05,297
for a $2,000 charge to the
Molly's checking account?

588
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:07,299
What did Cruz talk you into this time?

589
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:10,736
It was my idea.
A vintage Wurlitzer jukebox.

590
00:32:10,738 --> 00:32:13,438
For Molly's North.

591
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,574
Point person.

592
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:21,113
Hey, you going to this Molly's North

593
00:32:21,115 --> 00:32:22,147
thing tonight, Chief?

594
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:23,482
Sounds like Otis needs

595
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:26,285
all the warm bodies he can get.

596
00:32:26,287 --> 00:32:28,654
I think I will, Mouch.

597
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:31,423
Think I might bring a friend along.

598
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:43,502
- Hi.
- Hey.

599
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:45,504
I got some beer.

600
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:47,673
Blackhawks are on,
I figured we'd order in

601
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:49,474
but it looks like you have...

602
00:32:50,643 --> 00:32:51,677
Plans.

603
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,313
Yeah, I am going out

604
00:32:54,315 --> 00:32:57,182
with that radio guy, Mitch.

605
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:59,117
That's cool.

606
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:02,354
Yeah, but, rain check
on the Blackhawks.

607
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:06,325
Yeah, well, there's
82 games a season, so...

608
00:33:06,327 --> 00:33:07,693
Good night.

609
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:22,040
Now we're talking.

610
00:33:23,844 --> 00:33:26,712
Hey.

611
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:30,148
Well, we did it. We opened.

612
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:33,051
Crowd could be a bit bigger.

613
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:36,555
The important thing is
you got to buy Lily a jukebox.

614
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:38,690
- The Wurlitzer?
- Yeah.

615
00:33:38,692 --> 00:33:40,058
Herrmann, that's for you.

616
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,227
What do I want with a Wurlitzer?

617
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:44,229
You always said, Molly's works because

618
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:46,198
it's a neighborhood bar.

619
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,234
A warm place to hang with good people.

620
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:51,236
This is the Molly's North
version of that.

621
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:02,748
Hey, hey.

622
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,384
Nina.

623
00:34:05,386 --> 00:34:06,852
You both remember Nina Porter, right?

624
00:34:06,854 --> 00:34:08,086
- Yeah, of course.
- Hi.

625
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:09,721
Nice to see you again, Nina.

626
00:34:09,723 --> 00:34:12,190
- Um, yeah.
- Got it.

627
00:34:12,192 --> 00:34:14,259
Thanks for reaching out, Chief Boden.

628
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:16,395
At the hospital, I didn't realize that

629
00:34:16,397 --> 00:34:18,764
you were the firefighters
that brought my dad in.

630
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:21,199
I really appreciate
you being there for him.

631
00:34:21,201 --> 00:34:22,901
- Thanks.
- Um...

632
00:34:22,903 --> 00:34:24,703
My interest in your father

633
00:34:24,705 --> 00:34:27,406
goes a lot deeper
than an electrical fire.

634
00:34:27,408 --> 00:34:28,907
Um...

635
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:31,443
Must have been '74, '75,

636
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:33,278
I'm just about old enough for my father

637
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,280
to take me to the Checkerboard Lounge.

638
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:37,449
And,

639
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:41,286
his favorite act is playing that night.

640
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:43,922
Stoke Porter. Um...

641
00:34:43,924 --> 00:34:46,291
my father and I,
we had a tricky relationship.

642
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:49,728
We didn't see eye to eye on much.

643
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:53,465
But that night,
sitting up front with him,

644
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:56,802
Watching him soak up that music.

645
00:34:56,804 --> 00:34:59,304
The blues.

646
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:02,808
I felt like I stepped into his shoes...

647
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:05,444
just a little bit.

648
00:35:05,446 --> 00:35:08,313
I understood him a little better.

649
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:10,649
Now my father,
he's been gone three years now.

650
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:12,651
So...

651
00:35:12,653 --> 00:35:16,254
if I close my eyes,

652
00:35:16,256 --> 00:35:19,958
I can still feel his arm
around my shoulder.

653
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,328
I can still hear his voice
in my ear saying,

654
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,964
"Look up there, son.

655
00:35:25,966 --> 00:35:28,000
"He gets it.

656
00:35:28,002 --> 00:35:30,502
That's Stoke."

657
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:38,510
That's what your father did for me.

658
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:49,521
So, so we're
gonna drink to him now.

659
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:51,857
Come on, everybody.

660
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:53,692
- To Stoke.
- To Stoke.

661
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:55,694
To Stoke.

662
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,701
- Hey.
- Hey.

663
00:36:02,703 --> 00:36:04,536
Should have held off and
planned this a little better,

664
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:07,339
sorry about that.

665
00:36:07,341 --> 00:36:09,007
Are you kidding?

666
00:36:09,009 --> 00:36:12,377
This place hasn't seen a crowd
this big in 10 years.

667
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:15,013
At least.

668
00:36:15,015 --> 00:36:16,848
This is going to work, Brian.

669
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,383
You think?

670
00:36:36,702 --> 00:36:38,537
Hey.

671
00:36:38,539 --> 00:36:39,905
Hey.

672
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:42,407
I didn't know you were going to be here.

673
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:44,709
I was just going to say the same thing.

674
00:36:47,047 --> 00:36:48,747
It's a big crowd.

675
00:36:48,749 --> 00:36:50,849
Yeah.

676
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,553
That's bad.

677
00:36:54,555 --> 00:36:56,021
Bad?

678
00:36:57,023 --> 00:36:59,724
It's good for business, I guess.

679
00:36:59,726 --> 00:37:02,260
I'm just...

680
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:05,063
not in the mood for a crowd.

681
00:37:09,736 --> 00:37:13,905
Maybe something more quiet?

682
00:37:13,907 --> 00:37:15,740
Yeah.

683
00:37:15,742 --> 00:37:18,410
That sounds good.

684
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:45,815
- Hey Dad.
- Hey.

685
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:54,579
You all right?

686
00:37:54,581 --> 00:37:56,982
Yeah. You look good.

687
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:59,117
I am.

688
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,321
Nurse Maggie,
she snuck me a meatball sub...

689
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:05,123
And Dr. Rhodes says that

690
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:06,758
I can go home tomorrow.

691
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,628
That's great. I'll be here to take you.

692
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,898
Sorry I didn't stop by yesterday.

693
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,835
You don't look happy.

694
00:38:16,837 --> 00:38:18,837
I am happy. For you.

695
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:22,474
No, there's something wrong.

696
00:38:22,476 --> 00:38:25,443
I'm your father, I can tell.

697
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:32,651
I just...

698
00:38:32,653 --> 00:38:36,655
wish I could have done more
to help you when you got hurt.

699
00:38:36,657 --> 00:38:38,523
Help me?

700
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:42,527
Now, listen to me, Gabriella.

701
00:38:44,464 --> 00:38:46,865
You know, this little adventure
that I've been on,

702
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:50,969
with all the reporters
and all this attention...

703
00:38:50,971 --> 00:38:54,139
I... I know it's silly.

704
00:38:54,141 --> 00:38:56,508
No, it's not silly.
You were a hero out there, Dad.

705
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,376
No, it was just a moment.

706
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:01,179
It was, like, a quick decision.

707
00:39:01,181 --> 00:39:05,550
I know that that
doesn't change who I am.

708
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:09,988
Now you, you're there for people

709
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:12,490
even when they're at their worst.

710
00:39:12,492 --> 00:39:14,059
Like me.

711
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:16,707
You know, all last year.

712
00:39:17,053 --> 00:39:19,121
I was a mess.

713
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,838
Your brother and your mother
wouldn't even talk to me.

714
00:39:24,204 --> 00:39:26,494
But...

715
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:28,947
you, my love.

716
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:32,439
You were always there.

717
00:39:32,769 --> 00:39:35,423
That's who you are.

718
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:37,931
You're the real hero.

719
00:39:41,555 --> 00:39:44,138
My hero.

720
00:39:57,703 --> 00:40:02,328

1
00:00:00,195 --> 00:00:02,812
This whole living situation
with Severide,

2
00:00:02,866 --> 00:00:04,312
it's not a permanent thing.

3
00:00:04,375 --> 00:00:06,079
I'm gonna start
that apartment search again.

4
00:00:06,103 --> 00:00:07,357
No rush.

5
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:10,665
Severide, we are running out of time

6
00:00:10,712 --> 00:00:12,016
for you to shut down those leaks.

7
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,321
Yeah, copy that, Chief.

8
00:00:13,384 --> 00:00:14,917
Whoa!

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,119
Wait, where are you going?

10
00:00:17,188 --> 00:00:18,988
I'm headed for the roof.

11
00:00:19,056 --> 00:00:20,222
Where's Casey?

12
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:21,724
He went to get Severide.

13
00:00:22,827 --> 00:00:24,994
- Get ready!
- This is insane.

14
00:00:25,062 --> 00:00:26,729
One, two,

15
00:00:26,797 --> 00:00:28,130
three!

16
00:00:42,113 --> 00:00:43,479
Let's go round back!

17
00:00:43,548 --> 00:00:45,080
- Let's go!
- To the river!

18
00:01:06,604 --> 00:01:08,837
Where are they?

19
00:01:09,607 --> 00:01:12,007
Casey!

20
00:01:12,076 --> 00:01:14,343
Severide!

21
00:01:14,412 --> 00:01:16,445
There!

22
00:01:21,886 --> 00:01:23,786
Where's Severide?

23
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:27,523
Severide!

24
00:01:27,626 --> 00:01:29,359
I got Severide!

25
00:01:29,727 --> 00:01:31,694
Kelly!

26
00:01:31,763 --> 00:01:33,963
I'm gonna harness up and get him, Chief.

27

00:01:41,282 --> 00:01:43,806
- Otis, extend the aerial.
- Yeah, copy.

29
00:01:47,412 --> 00:01:49,012
Severide!

30
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,513
Casey, come to shore.

31
00:01:50,582 --> 00:01:53,016
Kidd will get him with the aerial.

32
00:01:53,084 --> 00:01:56,019
Squad, get him out. Get him out now.

33
00:01:56,087 --> 00:01:58,688
Watch your back.

34
00:02:04,396 --> 00:02:07,563
Okay, swing right.

35
00:02:10,902 --> 00:02:12,869
Swing stop.

36
00:02:14,105 --> 00:02:15,805
Show me what you do.

37
00:02:15,874 --> 00:02:17,440
Take her up.

38
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,414
Stella, you got this.

39
00:02:24,482 --> 00:02:26,382
Good.

40
00:02:26,451 --> 00:02:29,052
Swing right.

41
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:40,830
Hey!

42
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:42,732
You need to back up. Let us do our work.

43
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:44,667
- Get out of here!
- Okay. All right, yeah.

44
00:02:44,736 --> 00:02:46,502
You got it. Go get your man.

45
00:02:50,341 --> 00:02:51,741
Kelly!

46
00:02:55,113 --> 00:02:57,413
Kelly!

47
00:02:57,482 --> 00:02:59,949
Do it! Bring me down, bring me down!

48
00:03:13,865 --> 00:03:15,098
Bring us up!

49
00:03:18,837 --> 00:03:20,303
Kelly...

50
00:03:20,371 --> 00:03:23,439
Talk to me.

51
00:03:23,508 --> 00:03:25,942
Kelly! Kelly!

52
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,649
Kelly.

53
00:03:33,718 --> 00:03:36,285
Can you hear me?

54
00:03:38,456 --> 00:03:39,822
- Easy.
- Got him.

55
00:03:41,626 --> 00:03:43,259
Got him, got him.

56
00:03:47,298 --> 00:03:48,564
Nice and easy.

57
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:51,834
- Kelly!
- Watch his head.

58
00:03:51,903 --> 00:03:55,037
Severide, can you hear me?

59
00:03:55,106 --> 00:03:56,906
Kelly...

60
00:03:56,975 --> 00:03:59,675
Come on, Lieutenant, talk to us.

61
00:04:04,249 --> 00:04:06,649
All right.

62
00:04:10,522 --> 00:04:13,856
- Casey. Where's Casey?
- He's good.

63
00:04:13,925 --> 00:04:16,058
- He's fine.
- Come on, come on.

64
00:04:16,127 --> 00:04:17,260
We got you.

65
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:31,881
What the hell were you two thinking?

66
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,010
We weren't.

67
00:04:36,381 --> 00:04:38,881
That was incredible.

68
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,867
Get over here.

69
00:04:57,936 --> 00:04:59,702
You're not moving the rest of the day.

70
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:00,970
I'm good.

71
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,283
Didn't we have an understanding?

72
00:05:02,307 --> 00:05:04,373
No fivestory jumps into the river.

73
00:05:04,442 --> 00:05:07,777
I told you, I'm trying
to qualify for Tokyo 2020.

74
00:05:07,846 --> 00:05:09,812
High dive, gold medal.

75
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:11,547
I got to get my practice in where I can.

76
00:05:11,616 --> 00:05:13,583
Well, you didn't stick the landing.

77
00:05:13,651 --> 00:05:15,751
Actually I think I did.

78
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,787
Tens from all the judges.

79
00:05:17,856 --> 00:05:19,155
Must have missed it.

80
00:05:19,224 --> 00:05:22,225
I am happy to miss any and all of that.

81
00:05:22,293 --> 00:05:23,559
Can I get you anything else?

82
00:05:23,628 --> 00:05:26,629
You want hot chocolate? Apple cider?

83
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,599
You.

84
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,071
- You always have me.
- Well...

85
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:37,773
Then I don't need anything else.

86
00:05:53,424 --> 00:05:54,824
What took you so long?

87
00:05:54,893 --> 00:05:56,459
Boden called over to Med.

88
00:05:56,527 --> 00:06:00,730
Made Halstead's brother check
me out for a concussion.

89
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:04,634
- Will?
- Yeah, that's the one.

90
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,536
What'd he say?

91
00:06:07,605 --> 00:06:09,972
Take some Tylenol.

92
00:06:10,642 --> 00:06:13,409
- Seriously?
- More or less.

93
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:22,652
Okay, look, I'm supposed
to go into Molly's North

94
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,289
to train some new bartender,
but I'm gonna cancel

95
00:06:26,357 --> 00:06:30,693
and just make sure you're okay.

96
00:06:32,196 --> 00:06:34,363
Kelly?

97
00:06:34,432 --> 00:06:36,032
- Hey.
- Yeah. I'm okay.

98
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,835
I'm just, can you walk me
over to the couch?

99
00:06:39,904 --> 00:06:41,637
Yeah, of course. Come here.

100
00:06:41,706 --> 00:06:43,973
Here, come on.

101
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:48,811
- You good?
- Yeah.

102
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,146
Man, just breathe.

103
00:06:50,214 --> 00:06:51,414
What!

104
00:06:53,051 --> 00:06:55,351
You...

105
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,753
- You think that's funny?
- Yeah, it's funny.

106
00:06:57,822 --> 00:06:59,155
I was kidding. I'm fine.

107
00:06:59,223 --> 00:07:02,358
- Get your ass to Molly's.
- Gladly.

108
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,430
You're a terrible person.

109
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,835
I want a cleareyed selfassessment.

110
00:07:12,904 --> 00:07:14,870
I'm sore all over. I'm not gonna lie.

111
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:17,173
- But good to go, Chief.
- And you?

112
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:18,741
Went through the concussion protocol.

113
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,676
Flying colors. Fine.

114
00:07:20,745 --> 00:07:23,579
And if you weren't,
you wouldn't tell me anyway.

115
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:26,782
- Chief Huffhines.
- Wallace, Matt.

116
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:28,884
- Kelly Severide, Chief.
- Kelly.

117
00:07:29,954 --> 00:07:32,221
See the coverage
in the "SunTimes" last night?

118
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,023
Yes, I did. Very nice.

119
00:07:34,092 --> 00:07:35,624
Well, let me tell you,

120
00:07:35,693 --> 00:07:38,361
the office of public relations
has heard from everyone.

121
00:07:38,429 --> 00:07:40,196
The commissioner's office,
mayor's office.

122
00:07:40,264 --> 00:07:42,765
- Everyone is tickled pink.
- I'm glad.

123
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:45,034
So I reached out to the photographer

124
00:07:45,103 --> 00:07:48,537
who captured these amazing photographs.

125
00:07:48,606 --> 00:07:51,207
I'm sorry. This is...

126
00:07:51,275 --> 00:07:53,376
Nate Isaacs,
professional photo journalist.

127
00:07:53,444 --> 00:07:56,045
Right, and I said to Mr. Isaacs,

128
00:07:56,114 --> 00:07:58,381
I said, "Would you be
interested in doing"

129
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:01,817
a dayinthelife
pictorial spread?"

130
00:08:01,886 --> 00:08:04,887
A real inside look at what we do here.

131
00:08:04,956 --> 00:08:06,500
And I could not think of a better house

132
00:08:06,524 --> 00:08:08,958
than the one that produced
this stellar shot.

133
00:08:09,027 --> 00:08:11,093
Okay, so when are you thinking to, um...

134
00:08:11,162 --> 00:08:14,263
Right now. Today, this shift.

135
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:18,567
Chief, listen, if this
is an intrusion at all,

136
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:20,236
you just tell me and I'll take

137
00:08:20,304 --> 00:08:23,239
a big step back, just like at the scene.

138
00:08:23,307 --> 00:08:26,909
You tell me to move back,
and I do as I am told.

139
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,615
- Okay, why not.
- Great.

140
00:08:32,683 --> 00:08:36,118
Nate, I'll leave you to it.

141
00:08:36,187 --> 00:08:37,187
Thanks.

142
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:38,921
So how do you want to do this?

143
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,456
Go about your shift normally.

144
00:08:40,525 --> 00:08:42,202
At the end of the day,
we'll see what we have?

145
00:08:42,226 --> 00:08:44,093
- Good.
- Okay.

146
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,467
I heard from Hope.

147
00:08:51,536 --> 00:08:52,768
You did?

148
00:08:52,837 --> 00:08:54,136
Yeah, she sent me an email,

149
00:08:54,205 --> 00:08:55,471
said she's back in Fowlerton.

150
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,173
She wants to drive up and have lunch

151
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:59,708
so she can mend fences.

152
00:08:59,777 --> 00:09:01,377
What did you say?

153
00:09:01,446 --> 00:09:02,645
Delete.

154
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:05,347
Hey, so I am alerting you, ladies,

155
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,450
we have a photographer in our midst.

156
00:09:07,518 --> 00:09:09,952
- What does that mean?
- It's some press guy.

157
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:12,321
He's doing a dayinthelife
photo shoot.

158
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,294
Help.

159
00:09:18,362 --> 00:09:20,830
Help, Dawson.

160
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:24,834
It hurts.

161
00:09:24,902 --> 00:09:27,336
Gerald?

162
00:09:28,473 --> 00:09:31,340
- It hurts.
- You know this guy?

163
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:33,008
He's a frequent flyer. He's harmless.

164
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:35,478
- What happened?
- It's broke.

165
00:09:35,546 --> 00:09:38,347
Let me take a look, Gerald.

166
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:40,850
Okay, well, I don't think it's broken,

167
00:09:40,918 --> 00:09:42,651
but we can get you to the hospital.

168
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,820
What happened?

169
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:46,755
I... I fell.

170
00:09:46,824 --> 00:09:48,657
Where'd this happen?

171
00:09:48,726 --> 00:09:50,359
Home.

172
00:09:51,395 --> 00:09:53,329
You walked all the way over here?

173
00:09:55,106 --> 00:09:56,877
Okay, listen, Gerald,
we're gonna get you a sling

174
00:09:56,901 --> 00:09:58,545
for your arm so you
won't keep cradling it.

175
00:09:58,569 --> 00:10:00,080
We're gonna take an xray
at the hospital

176
00:10:00,104 --> 00:10:02,004
just to make sure it's not broken, okay?

177
00:10:02,073 --> 00:10:04,406
- Come on.
- I got it.

178
00:10:04,475 --> 00:10:06,408
Come on, buddy. Let me help you up.

179
00:10:07,778 --> 00:10:10,179
There we go.

180
00:10:17,588 --> 00:10:18,954
That's the guy.

181
00:10:19,023 --> 00:10:20,467
Do you want me to tell him to back off?

182
00:10:20,491 --> 00:10:21,690
No, no, it's fine.

183
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,426
Come on, Gerald. Let's go.

184
00:10:30,775 --> 00:10:32,810
Hey, close the blinds so we can hide

185
00:10:32,837 --> 00:10:34,511
from this photographer.

186
00:10:40,286 --> 00:10:41,618
Psst, hey.

187
00:10:42,855 --> 00:10:44,588
He's hiding in here.

188
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:54,798
What do you need, Kidd?

189
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:57,401
Actually, it can wait.

190
00:10:57,582 --> 00:11:00,082
Well, don't mind me.

191
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:01,584
Okay.

192
00:11:01,652 --> 00:11:05,998
I just wanted to ask
if I could swap next week

193
00:11:06,045 --> 00:11:08,513
with Grigsby on third shift.

194
00:11:09,994 --> 00:11:12,494
I have a lead on an apartment

195
00:11:12,563 --> 00:11:16,871
and the building manager
wants to meet with me.

196
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,873
Yeah, sure. No problem.

197
00:11:23,941 --> 00:11:26,890
Just write it down on a sticky note,

198
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,310
put it in my office.

199
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:30,512
Okay. Will do.

200
00:11:39,857 --> 00:11:42,391
- Trouble at home?
- Not on my end.

201
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,464
I told her she could stay
as long as she wants.

202
00:11:54,457 --> 00:11:57,270
My God. She didn't.

203
00:11:57,408 --> 00:11:58,741
- Who didn't?
- Hope.

204
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:00,542
You know how I deleted her email?

205
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,046
Now she's trashing me on Facebook.

206
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:03,598
Nah.

207
00:12:06,884 --> 00:12:08,896
These are mutual friends
she's stirring up in Fowlerton.

208
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,430
Who knows what she's saying
in real life.

209
00:12:10,454 --> 00:12:11,959
You got to drag her.

210
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,170
You send out a blast,
and you let everybody back home

211
00:12:14,217 --> 00:12:16,030
know the stunts
that she pulled in Chicago.

212
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,594
Yeah, I saw these two
celebrities brawling on Twitter

213
00:12:18,662 --> 00:12:22,531
and it was everything.
Do something like that.

214
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:25,892
You know what, I'm just gonna

215
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,462
go with my first instinct
and ignore her.

216
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,342
Come on, girl, you got
to stand up for yourself.

217
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:34,000
I stand up when it's
something worth standing up to.

218
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:36,502
Hope isn't worth it.

219
00:12:38,806 --> 00:12:41,975
Ambulance 61.
Man down from unknown causes.

220
00:12:42,038 --> 00:12:43,976
8451 Racine.

221
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:46,913
Everything?

222
00:12:46,981 --> 00:12:48,414
It's hyperbole.

223
00:12:54,923 --> 00:12:56,188
Why a goat?

224
00:12:56,257 --> 00:12:57,801
Well there are many guesses about that.

225
00:12:57,825 --> 00:13:00,026
The only plausible one I heard is

226
00:13:00,094 --> 00:13:02,995
that this house was built
on an old goat farm.

227
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:08,501
No, no, no, just go about your business.

228
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:10,080
- Ignore me.
- No, what we were gonna do

229
00:13:10,104 --> 00:13:11,771
is smoke a couple cigars.

230
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,606
You know, I could put my camera down,

231
00:13:13,675 --> 00:13:17,009
and, join you guys.

232
00:13:19,714 --> 00:13:22,515
How do you get impaled on an iron fence?

233
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,116
He was trying to kill himself.

234
00:13:24,185 --> 00:13:27,119
- Jumped out a fourstory window.
- Ouch.

235
00:13:27,188 --> 00:13:30,790
SGBS isn't fixing that?
Super glue, baking soda.

236
00:13:30,858 --> 00:13:33,225
Medics in the field, they swore by it.

237
00:13:33,294 --> 00:13:35,239
Said it was better than gauze
for packing a wound.

238
00:13:35,263 --> 00:13:38,731
- Where were you embedded?
- Afghanistan, five months.

239
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,368
Of course, Chicago can be
its own war zone sometimes.

240
00:13:42,437 --> 00:13:45,471
Don't ask.

241
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,940
I'm gonna shower and change now.

242
00:13:48,776 --> 00:13:50,977
Got a call, guy was face down on Racine.

243
00:13:51,045 --> 00:13:52,545
Turned him over and...

244
00:13:52,613 --> 00:13:53,980
All over Dawson.

245
00:13:54,048 --> 00:13:55,881
50/50 chance it could have been me.

246
00:13:56,751 --> 00:13:59,719
Listen, I'm gonna go get some coffee.

247
00:13:59,787 --> 00:14:01,721
Anybody want anything?

248
00:14:05,994 --> 00:14:09,562
Be right back. Nobody touch my cigar.

249
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,897
Don't worry.

250
00:14:14,502 --> 00:14:15,846
Captain, did you get a chance to look

251
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,503
- over my furlough request?
- Not yet.

252
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:18,849
Everybody wants Fourth of July off.

253
00:14:18,873 --> 00:14:20,384
That's why I put in five months early.

254
00:14:20,408 --> 00:14:21,674
Okay, I'll be sure to look at

255
00:14:21,743 --> 00:14:24,010
that pressing concern after I...

256
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:26,078
I need to know.

257
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:48,834
Casey!

258
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:50,703
Hey, take it easy, man.

259
00:14:50,772 --> 00:14:52,038
Are you kidding me?

260
00:14:52,106 --> 00:14:53,539
Hey, what's going on?

261
00:14:53,608 --> 00:14:56,776
Found this scumbag lurking
outside your shower.

262
00:14:56,844 --> 00:14:59,512
I had no idea that
these were coed bathrooms.

263
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,547
So you just decided to

264
00:15:01,616 --> 00:15:04,050
explore the bathroom
you didn't know was coed?

265
00:15:04,118 --> 00:15:06,919
Right after I said I was going
to take a shower?

266
00:15:07,655 --> 00:15:09,321
- Get out.
- Just hold on for a moment...

267
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,823
Get your camera and get out

268
00:15:10,892 --> 00:15:12,458
before I beat the hell out of you.

269
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:14,126
I mean it!

270
00:15:26,574 --> 00:15:29,087
That was freaky.

271
00:15:44,584 --> 00:15:46,244
- What happened?
- The photographer you brought

272
00:15:46,268 --> 00:15:49,367
into my firehouse was playing
peeping tom in the bathroom.

273
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:55,393
I, I can't even...

274
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,240
It happened while I was in the shower.

275
00:16:00,812 --> 00:16:02,878
Okay, well, I'll,
I'll call the paper.

276
00:16:02,947 --> 00:16:05,548
And we'll call CPD.

277
00:16:05,616 --> 00:16:06,774
You want him arrested?

278
00:16:06,822 --> 00:16:08,889
I want a formal complaint.

279
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,676
- On the record.
- If it happened here,

280
00:16:10,746 --> 00:16:14,127
it ain't the first time.
Someone needs to know.

281
00:16:15,164 --> 00:16:16,797
Well...

282
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:20,634
You're right. You're right, um.

283
00:16:20,703 --> 00:16:23,904
I'm, I'm embarrassed
this happened.

284
00:16:23,973 --> 00:16:26,306
And I should have done
a better job at vetting him

285
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,808
before I proposed this.

286
00:16:27,876 --> 00:16:29,142
It's not your fault.

287
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:31,812
You just got caught up in the buzz.

288
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,480
You know what?

289
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:34,982
Let me call the CPD?

290
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:38,051
- I should be the one.
- I'll do it.

291
00:16:42,658 --> 00:16:46,159
Okay.

292
00:16:46,228 --> 00:16:48,795
Again...

293
00:16:48,864 --> 00:16:51,331
I'm sorry.

294
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:03,543
Okay, we are on the Blue Cobras.

295
00:17:03,612 --> 00:17:05,679
- They'll announce it.
- Okay.

296
00:17:05,748 --> 00:17:08,181
So you have done this before?

297
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,950
I'm in league.

298
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:11,730
And we happen to have
a spot open for tonight

299
00:17:11,754 --> 00:17:13,620
which you're filling.

300
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:16,356
I will bring it. Don't you worry.

301
00:17:16,425 --> 00:17:19,626
How's the apartment search coming?

302
00:17:19,695 --> 00:17:20,894
I got a lead.

303
00:17:20,963 --> 00:17:23,363
- Yeah?
- Yes. Yeah.

304
00:17:23,432 --> 00:17:25,432
You excited about living alone again?

305
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:30,203
My God, you play WhirlyBall?

306
00:17:30,272 --> 00:17:32,172
- Hi.
- She is a firsttimer.

307
00:17:32,241 --> 00:17:33,974
- Hi, Stella.
- Lily.

308
00:17:34,043 --> 00:17:35,242
Brian and I are thinking of

309
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,044
going on the championship circuit.

310
00:17:37,112 --> 00:17:39,046
I'm not gonna say we
perfected the Malachi Crunch

311
00:17:39,114 --> 00:17:41,148
but...

312
00:17:41,216 --> 00:17:43,550
- What team you guys on?
- The, um...

313
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:46,153
Next up on Court 2, the Dig Dug Express

314
00:17:46,221 --> 00:17:48,455
- against the Blue Cobras.
- That's us.

315
00:17:48,991 --> 00:17:51,024
Us too.

316
00:17:51,093 --> 00:17:53,393
You guys are going so down.

317
00:17:54,797 --> 00:17:56,863
Okay.

318
00:17:57,566 --> 00:17:58,865
Ready for a refill, buddy?

319
00:17:58,934 --> 00:18:01,134
Sure. Thanks.

320
00:18:05,074 --> 00:18:08,508
Okay, look, I'm not one to pry,

321
00:18:08,577 --> 00:18:12,846
but as your bartender,
I got responsibilities.

322
00:18:12,915 --> 00:18:16,049
So, what's going on?

323
00:18:16,118 --> 00:18:18,685
Come on, maybe I can help.

324
00:18:18,754 --> 00:18:20,687
I've seen stuff.

325
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,056
It's my girlfriend, Alice.

326
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,525
She wants to move in,
but I think it's too soon.

327
00:18:25,594 --> 00:18:28,128
- Do you love her?
- It's only been six months.

328
00:18:28,197 --> 00:18:30,597
What's your name, pal?

329
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,733
- Kevin.
- Okay, Kevin.

330
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:34,301
Look at it like this, okay?

331
00:18:34,369 --> 00:18:37,804
- Life, it's like a fire.
- Boy.

332
00:18:37,873 --> 00:18:39,206
You go in too far too fast,

333
00:18:39,274 --> 00:18:41,541
you're gonna get burnt up, right?

334
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,110
- I guess.
- Yeah.

335
00:18:43,178 --> 00:18:45,545
But if you throw water on too soon,

336
00:18:45,614 --> 00:18:47,948
you know, you're in
a rush to cool it down,

337
00:18:48,016 --> 00:18:49,761
then you are going to boil
those firefighters

338
00:18:49,785 --> 00:18:53,186
like, you know, a bunch of lobsters.

339
00:18:54,123 --> 00:18:56,056
- Okay.
- So, listen.

340
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,635
You and Alice, you got some heat, right?

341
00:18:57,659 --> 00:18:59,326
- I think so.
- Well, what you got to try

342
00:18:59,394 --> 00:19:02,162
to figure out is, is it the kind of heat

343
00:19:02,231 --> 00:19:04,231
that you want to run into

344
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:06,266
- or you want to run out of?
- Yeah, I don't think

345
00:19:06,335 --> 00:19:08,168
- that's a usefu...
- No, actually,

346
00:19:08,237 --> 00:19:11,238
- that makes total sense.
- Yeah.

347
00:19:11,306 --> 00:19:12,460
See?

348
00:19:13,342 --> 00:19:15,776
Thanks, man. I really appreciate it.

349
00:19:15,844 --> 00:19:17,577
You got it.

350
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,147
That was pretty good,
what you did over there.

351
00:19:20,215 --> 00:19:23,583
Yeah? I'm just helping out where I can.

352
00:19:27,022 --> 00:19:30,457
"Mitchell Monroe,
Life Coach Managers."

353
00:19:30,526 --> 00:19:31,958
- Whoo.
- I'm a talent manager

354
00:19:32,027 --> 00:19:33,260
for life coaches.

355
00:19:33,328 --> 00:19:35,495
I help turn, you know, advice

356
00:19:35,564 --> 00:19:38,098
into a profitable business.

357
00:19:39,434 --> 00:19:40,600
Okay.

358
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:42,169
Tell me more about profitable.

359
00:19:42,237 --> 00:19:45,172
Well, my coaches charge
$40 an hour to start.

360
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,274
I provide the training,
I manage the paperwork

361
00:19:47,342 --> 00:19:49,976
and the invoices,
I take 10% off the top.

362
00:19:50,045 --> 00:19:53,113
And it's my job to, what?

363
00:19:53,182 --> 00:19:55,115
Coach people's lives?

364
00:19:55,184 --> 00:19:56,895
Something you seem
to be doing pretty naturally

365
00:19:56,919 --> 00:19:58,185
from what I just witnessed.

366
00:19:58,253 --> 00:20:02,355
Your words of wisdom, they have value.

367
00:20:03,892 --> 00:20:05,158
You give me a call

368
00:20:05,227 --> 00:20:07,294
when you're ready to take the next step.

369
00:20:17,206 --> 00:20:19,439
- Hey.
- Hey.

370
00:20:20,876 --> 00:20:23,076
Have you played WhirlyBall before?

371
00:20:23,145 --> 00:20:25,545
Because it is not as easy as it looks.

372
00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:30,884
Yeah, well, I mean
we should get a team together.

373
00:20:30,953 --> 00:20:33,753
Otis and Lily are, like, regulars.

374
00:20:33,822 --> 00:20:36,323
And then Zach knows the manager,

375
00:20:36,391 --> 00:20:39,926
so, you know, I mean we could
go whenever we wanted.

376
00:20:39,995 --> 00:20:42,395
Sounds interesting.

377
00:20:43,498 --> 00:20:45,565
Are you,

378
00:20:45,634 --> 00:20:48,735
- you staying up?
- Nah, I'm gonna go to bed.

379
00:20:48,804 --> 00:20:52,939
You sure? 'Cause it's me
and you, I can,

380
00:20:53,008 --> 00:20:54,574
I can rally.

381
00:20:54,643 --> 00:20:55,942
Nah, it's okay.

382
00:20:56,011 --> 00:20:57,644
Gonna get some shuteye.

383
00:21:02,517 --> 00:21:04,150
Okay.

384
00:21:32,914 --> 00:21:34,140
Could have been worse.

385
00:21:34,187 --> 00:21:35,783
Had he taken pictures of you?

386
00:21:35,851 --> 00:21:37,017
No, I mean for him.

387
00:21:37,086 --> 00:21:38,525
Matt was about to rip his head off,

388
00:21:38,627 --> 00:21:39,787
and I was ready to help.

389
00:21:39,855 --> 00:21:41,455
He's lucky to be alive.

390
00:21:42,358 --> 00:21:44,158
Is that Gerald again?

391
00:21:46,862 --> 00:21:48,429
Gerald?

392
00:21:55,705 --> 00:21:57,638
I... I need medicine.

393
00:21:59,975 --> 00:22:02,543
Gerald, what's going on?

394
00:22:02,644 --> 00:22:03,910
It hurts.

395
00:22:03,973 --> 00:22:05,003
Okay, we're gonna get you something

396
00:22:05,027 --> 00:22:06,077
out of the back of the ambulance.

397
00:22:06,101 --> 00:22:07,634
Just give us a second here.

398
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,114
What do you think?

399
00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:16,666
I think he's being messed with.

400
00:22:16,766 --> 00:22:19,233
He walks all the way over here, twice?

401
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:29,623
R. E. Fire!

402
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,379
The reason why you are here
is you need to get your life

403
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:35,950
in order, and I am here
to help you with that.

404
00:22:36,018 --> 00:22:40,487
- What's the "F" stand for?
- "F" stands for

405
00:22:40,556 --> 00:22:41,956
fire pole.

406
00:22:42,024 --> 00:22:43,290
The thing that connects

407
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:46,827
the two floors of a firehouse is a pole.

408
00:22:46,896 --> 00:22:49,463
Pole starts with a "P."

409
00:22:49,532 --> 00:22:52,132
It's a fire pole. Fire.

410
00:22:52,201 --> 00:22:54,168
It is always there when you need it,

411
00:22:54,237 --> 00:22:56,904
and in an emergency, it will help you

412
00:22:56,973 --> 00:22:59,240
quickly get to the things that you need.

413
00:22:59,308 --> 00:23:01,375
- Yes, Joseph?
- Why are you doing

414
00:23:01,444 --> 00:23:02,977
this thing so formal?

415
00:23:03,045 --> 00:23:04,745
The thing that makes you unique

416
00:23:04,814 --> 00:23:06,513
is that you are not formal.

417
00:23:06,582 --> 00:23:10,484
Clients are going to pay
a lot of money for this.

418
00:23:10,553 --> 00:23:13,988
You need to, um,

419
00:23:14,056 --> 00:23:16,056
"show them that you are a professional

420
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:19,994
in dress and manner and in method."

421
00:23:20,062 --> 00:23:21,662
Well, continue then.

422
00:23:21,731 --> 00:23:23,097
Thank you.

423
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:39,213
Hello?

424
00:24:07,243 --> 00:24:08,243
Hey, Lester.

425
00:24:08,277 --> 00:24:11,745
- How's your foot?
- It's a lot better, thanks.

426
00:24:12,882 --> 00:24:14,481
You looking for Gerald?

427
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,117
No, actually,
we know where Gerald is.

428
00:24:17,186 --> 00:24:20,020
Do you know if anyone's bothering him?

429
00:24:21,891 --> 00:24:24,224
Hey, it's okay. You can tell us.

430
00:24:25,628 --> 00:24:28,729
I don't want nothing to do with this.

431
00:24:33,736 --> 00:24:35,769
That's Gerald's tent right there.

432
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,447
Hey, whoever's in Gerald's tent

433
00:24:46,515 --> 00:24:48,115
needs to come out.

434
00:24:56,826 --> 00:24:58,592
What do you want?

435
00:24:58,661 --> 00:25:00,160
That's Gerald's house.

436
00:25:00,229 --> 00:25:02,096
- Not no more.
- Come on, let's go.

437
00:25:02,164 --> 00:25:03,864
- No, Dawson, no.
- This is my house.

438
00:25:03,933 --> 00:25:06,433
This is my street. Go home, skanks.

439
00:25:06,502 --> 00:25:09,269
No, this is not your street. It's mine.

440
00:25:09,338 --> 00:25:11,538
Along with his and his and theirs.

441
00:25:11,607 --> 00:25:13,340
You know who else's streets these are?

442
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:15,709
Every paramedic
and firefighter in Chicago.

443
00:25:15,778 --> 00:25:17,189
We've been on every block in this city

444
00:25:17,213 --> 00:25:18,813
and helped someone on every one of them.

445
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,208
And all those people we've helped,

446
00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:22,182
they're on our team, not yours.

447
00:25:22,251 --> 00:25:24,952
You mess with Gerald again
or anyone else in this camp,

448
00:25:25,021 --> 00:25:26,398
then you'll be picking a fight with us

449
00:25:26,422 --> 00:25:27,955
and everyone that's loyal to us,

450
00:25:28,024 --> 00:25:30,824
and then you'll find out
whose streets these are.

451
00:25:53,315 --> 00:25:55,215
She used to be my friend.

452
00:25:55,284 --> 00:25:57,684
Are you sure you don't want
to go to the shelter, Gerald?

453
00:25:58,754 --> 00:26:01,989
You call us if anybody
messes with you again, okay?

454
00:26:12,735 --> 00:26:14,168
I think I will email Hope back.

455
00:26:14,236 --> 00:26:15,781
Tell her straight up
I'm not interested in

456
00:26:15,805 --> 00:26:17,104
anything she has to say,

457
00:26:17,173 --> 00:26:19,239
just so there's no misunderstandings.

458
00:26:24,547 --> 00:26:26,580
Hey! What's up?

459
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,450
Just thought I'd drop
in with some cookies.

460
00:26:29,518 --> 00:26:30,751
Aw.

461
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,253
I swear you are an angel.

462
00:26:33,322 --> 00:26:34,888
- Good time for it.
- Hey!

463
00:26:34,957 --> 00:26:37,024
We're losing all faith
in humanity around here.

464
00:26:37,093 --> 00:26:39,193
- Rough call?
- Worse.

465
00:26:39,261 --> 00:26:41,528
Pervert came into the firehouse.

466
00:26:41,597 --> 00:26:42,896
- Thanks.
- Good.

467
00:26:42,965 --> 00:26:45,199
All right, question for the group.

468
00:26:45,267 --> 00:26:47,101
I am gonna need some help

469
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:49,870
getting this life coach thing
off the ground.

470
00:26:51,273 --> 00:26:52,906
Why don't I be your first client?

471
00:26:52,975 --> 00:26:55,075
- No.
- Yeah, great!

472
00:26:55,144 --> 00:26:58,312
Done! You are not gonna be disappointed.

473
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,047
Okay, let's,

474
00:27:00,116 --> 00:27:02,816
get you signed up, and then
we'll get you started.

475
00:27:02,885 --> 00:27:04,084
- Okay?
- Now?

476
00:27:04,153 --> 00:27:06,053
- Why not?
- Okay, we gonna... no?

477
00:27:06,122 --> 00:27:07,955
- You said.
- No, okay, I didn't...

478
00:27:08,023 --> 00:27:09,756
We'll just go on back here.

479
00:27:09,825 --> 00:27:11,091
I got stuff to talk about.

480
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,659
What just happened?

481
00:27:12,728 --> 00:27:14,928
You see the "F"

482
00:27:14,997 --> 00:27:18,132
is for you're...

483
00:27:33,415 --> 00:27:34,982
How was it?

484
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:37,618
Brett was awesome as always.

485
00:27:38,154 --> 00:27:39,620
I just got off the phone

486
00:27:39,688 --> 00:27:41,421
with both the "SunTimes"
and "The Tribune."

487
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,757
They said they're severing
all ties with Nate Isaacs

488
00:27:43,826 --> 00:27:46,426
and will blast his name to
all the press in the area.

489
00:27:46,495 --> 00:27:48,428
They assured me they
took it very seriously.

490
00:27:48,497 --> 00:27:50,063
Good riddance.

491
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:53,100
Well, I thought you would like to know.

492
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:55,135
You thought right.

493
00:27:57,173 --> 00:27:59,273
So, how was it?

494
00:27:59,341 --> 00:28:00,874
Really good actually.

495
00:28:00,943 --> 00:28:04,111
- He's a very wise man.
- Really?

496
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,313
Really, really.

497
00:28:06,382 --> 00:28:07,881
Yeah, I told him about my sister,

498
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,550
and he said I should reach out to her

499
00:28:09,618 --> 00:28:12,519
which is what I've been
thinking for a long time.

500
00:28:12,588 --> 00:28:14,154
You have a sister?

501
00:28:16,192 --> 00:28:17,672
Then we started to talk about Hawaii.

502
00:28:17,726 --> 00:28:19,371
You know, how I wanted to go
there after college

503
00:28:19,395 --> 00:28:20,827
but my parents put the kibosh

504
00:28:20,896 --> 00:28:22,529
on that particular dream.

505
00:28:22,598 --> 00:28:25,332
He said, "Sometimes ladders
don't reach the highest floor",

506
00:28:25,401 --> 00:28:27,901
but we have to hump up the stairs,"

507
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:29,703
which is really solid advice.

508
00:28:29,772 --> 00:28:32,906
So, yeah, I'm gonna think about it.

509
00:28:32,975 --> 00:28:34,741
About what?

510
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:37,010
You know, moving to Hawaii.

511
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:39,179
Anyway, today was really fun.

512
00:28:39,248 --> 00:28:40,725
I'll see you tomorrow at Molly's North?

513
00:28:40,749 --> 00:28:42,983
Yeah.

514
00:28:43,052 --> 00:28:44,551
Definitely.

515
00:28:47,423 --> 00:28:50,357
Right after I murder someone.

516
00:29:10,045 --> 00:29:11,578
Hey.

517
00:29:11,647 --> 00:29:13,080
Hey.

518
00:29:14,717 --> 00:29:16,383
What's up?

519
00:29:25,361 --> 00:29:29,029
I just think things are
getting weird between us.

520
00:29:29,098 --> 00:29:31,398
It's not weird for me.

521
00:29:32,301 --> 00:29:35,202
Look, I'd like to say what I mean.

522
00:29:35,271 --> 00:29:38,538
You know I'm not much
for dancing around subjects.

523
00:29:38,607 --> 00:29:40,240
Me either.

524
00:29:42,578 --> 00:29:47,447
Um, it's just this Zach guy
is really cool.

525
00:29:47,516 --> 00:29:52,719
And we have a lot of fun together.

526
00:29:52,788 --> 00:29:54,821
And it may get serious.

527
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:59,092
Who knows? It feels like
it's heading in that direction.

528
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:05,198
But you...

529
00:30:07,603 --> 00:30:09,469
are so special to me.

530
00:30:10,072 --> 00:30:11,772
And, um...

531
00:30:12,775 --> 00:30:14,641
so important.

532
00:30:19,181 --> 00:30:22,249
And I just feel like it'll... it'll

533
00:30:22,318 --> 00:30:26,286
clear up a lot
of things once I move out.

534
00:30:36,965 --> 00:30:38,465
Okay?

535
00:30:39,968 --> 00:30:42,102
All right, well, um,

536
00:30:42,171 --> 00:30:45,906
thank you for, listening to that.

537
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:51,244
Do you want to hear my opinion?

538
00:30:54,783 --> 00:30:57,250
Yeah.

539
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,355
I don't want you to leave.

540
00:31:06,195 --> 00:31:10,464
Truck 81, Ambulance 61.
Single vehicle accident.

541
00:31:10,532 --> 00:31:13,500
500 block West Harrison Street
Eastbound.

542
00:31:36,325 --> 00:31:37,858
Crowd control, block off the sidewalk.

543
00:31:37,926 --> 00:31:39,993
Give us some room to work.
Otis, Mouch, with me.

544
00:31:40,062 --> 00:31:41,228
Stand back, sir.

545
00:31:41,296 --> 00:31:42,596
Excuse me. Stand back, please.

546
00:31:42,664 --> 00:31:45,565
Ma'am, can you tell us what happened?

547
00:31:45,634 --> 00:31:47,501
I don't know, I just
looked down for a second.

548
00:31:47,569 --> 00:31:49,035
And the car started spinning.

549
00:31:49,104 --> 00:31:51,505
We're gonna have
our medics take a look, okay?

550
00:31:51,573 --> 00:31:53,407
Back up. Thank you.

551
00:31:54,176 --> 00:31:55,375
Okay.

552
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,678
Captain.

553
00:32:02,518 --> 00:32:04,684
Hey!

554
00:32:05,053 --> 00:32:06,686
Get off the scene.

555
00:32:06,755 --> 00:32:08,088
I got a right to be here.

556
00:32:08,157 --> 00:32:09,456
I ain't asking.

557
00:32:09,525 --> 00:32:10,757
Freedom of the press, buddy.

558
00:32:10,826 --> 00:32:13,360
You can try to destroy my name

559
00:32:13,429 --> 00:32:16,563
but I can still sell photos
of public employees

560
00:32:16,632 --> 00:32:18,432
wherever and whenever I want!

561
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,735
Casey, don't. He's not worth it.

562
00:32:25,307 --> 00:32:27,374
- How you doing? You all right?
- I'm okay.

563
00:32:27,443 --> 00:32:29,543
Hey, you gonna give us
the room to do our jobs?

564
00:32:29,611 --> 00:32:31,745
It's a public street, lady.

565
00:32:32,981 --> 00:32:34,614
How you feeling, honey?

566
00:32:34,683 --> 00:32:36,126
- Okay, I guess.
- We can get her out

567
00:32:36,222 --> 00:32:37,888
as soon as we pop the door.

568
00:32:50,299 --> 00:32:51,916
Call for a second ambo!

569
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,878
Casey!

570
00:33:13,046 --> 00:33:15,547
Pulse is strong. He's alert.

571
00:33:15,616 --> 00:33:16,842
What happened?

572
00:33:16,938 --> 00:33:19,203
You stepped in the street
and got hit by a car.

573
00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:21,015
But the captain saved you.

574
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:42,936
One hell of a call.

575
00:33:43,738 --> 00:33:45,004
Could say that.

576
00:33:45,073 --> 00:33:46,472
Herrmann says you didn't hesitate.

577
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:47,974
Not for a second.

578
00:33:50,912 --> 00:33:52,912
Nope.

579
00:33:54,482 --> 00:33:56,082
That's good.

580
00:33:56,151 --> 00:33:58,117
You sure about that?

581
00:33:58,186 --> 00:33:59,752
'Cause I'm not.

582
00:33:59,821 --> 00:34:01,165
And what if the man you saved today

583
00:34:01,189 --> 00:34:03,906
is different from the one
he was yesterday?

584
00:34:04,426 --> 00:34:06,426
You think he's magically reformed

585
00:34:06,494 --> 00:34:08,761
- because he got hit by a car?
- No.

586
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,763
I think if we start
wondering if one life

587
00:34:10,832 --> 00:34:12,498
has more value than another,

588
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:14,197
we can't do our job.

589
00:34:16,135 --> 00:34:18,638
Today you gave Isaacs the
second half of his life back.

590
00:34:18,707 --> 00:34:20,440
You can't control what he does with it.

591
00:34:23,111 --> 00:34:26,112
But a life saved...

592
00:34:26,181 --> 00:34:27,613
That's one for the win column.

593
00:34:27,682 --> 00:34:29,515
I will take that win any day,

594
00:34:29,584 --> 00:34:31,384
no matter who it is.

595
00:34:34,255 --> 00:34:36,622
So...

596
00:34:39,461 --> 00:34:41,694
I am proud of you, Captain.

597
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,440
Isaacs is stable.

598
00:34:58,541 --> 00:35:01,158
Well, you know, physically anyway.

599
00:35:02,236 --> 00:35:03,674
What, too soon?

600
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:07,009
Yeah.

601
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,700
Well...

602
00:35:11,013 --> 00:35:12,138
Thank you.

603
00:35:12,691 --> 00:35:13,839
For what?

604
00:35:14,802 --> 00:35:17,177
For being the sort of man who
will protect me from a creep.

605
00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:20,403
And then run into traffic
to save the creep.

606
00:35:22,237 --> 00:35:24,597
I love you.

607
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,006
I love you too.

608
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,109
Two, three, and four.

609
00:35:30,178 --> 00:35:33,179
- What's this?
- 10%. I had my first client.

610
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,948
And it went pretty damn well
if I do say so myself.

611
00:35:36,017 --> 00:35:37,784
We can settle up
when you get a few more.

612
00:35:37,852 --> 00:35:40,420
- All right.
- Speaking of which,

613
00:35:40,488 --> 00:35:44,557
I need a check from you for $800.

614
00:35:44,626 --> 00:35:45,925
What for?

615
00:35:45,994 --> 00:35:47,860
Well, I added you to my gold roster

616
00:35:47,929 --> 00:35:49,562
which is for active life coaches

617
00:35:49,631 --> 00:35:51,364
who have completed the bronze workbook

618
00:35:51,433 --> 00:35:53,533
- which you did.
- What now?

619
00:35:53,601 --> 00:35:55,868
- You!
- What? Me?

620
00:35:55,937 --> 00:35:57,537
I took your stupid advice.

621
00:35:57,605 --> 00:35:59,105
I told Alice that moving in with her

622
00:35:59,174 --> 00:36:00,785
made me feel like
I was being cooked alive.

623
00:36:00,809 --> 00:36:02,642
Listen, I didn't say to say that.

624
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,877
I definitely didn't tell
you to say that.

625
00:36:04,946 --> 00:36:06,379
- She dumped me!
- Look.

626
00:36:06,448 --> 00:36:07,713
I mean, you...

627
00:36:07,782 --> 00:36:08,782
Hey, hey, take it easy.

628
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,383
You ruined my life.

629
00:36:10,452 --> 00:36:13,252
Okay, buddy.

630
00:36:16,825 --> 00:36:18,858
So that was a setback.

631
00:36:23,731 --> 00:36:26,265
I think that you need to leave.

632
00:36:27,902 --> 00:36:29,235
Okay.

633
00:36:29,304 --> 00:36:31,671
That's all right.

634
00:36:31,739 --> 00:36:33,940
Excuse me.

635
00:36:35,243 --> 00:36:37,410
What was all that?

636
00:36:37,479 --> 00:36:40,113
Listening to me for advice

637
00:36:40,181 --> 00:36:42,949
might be the dumbest thing
that you could do.

638
00:36:43,017 --> 00:36:44,317
No.

639
00:36:44,385 --> 00:36:46,486
Lily was very appreciative.

640
00:36:46,554 --> 00:36:49,122
- Really?
- Yeah.

641
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:52,792
You gave her some excellent
things to think about.

642
00:36:55,497 --> 00:36:57,096
Well, you know what, you tell her

643
00:36:57,165 --> 00:36:59,031
that I don't think that I'm gonna be

644
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,167
in, you know,
life coaching business anymore.

645
00:37:01,236 --> 00:37:03,102
I'm gonna stick with what I know.

646
00:37:03,171 --> 00:37:06,472
Firefighting and running this bar.

647
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:08,719
You know what? Actually I
might run over to Molly's North

648
00:37:08,743 --> 00:37:11,777
right now and let her know
that before she decides.

649
00:37:11,846 --> 00:37:13,379
- Cover for me.
- Yeah.

650
00:37:13,448 --> 00:37:16,149
You got it, buddy.

651
00:37:18,553 --> 00:37:19,785
Something to get you started.

652
00:37:19,854 --> 00:37:21,354
- Thank you.
- Ooh.

653
00:37:21,422 --> 00:37:24,056
Fancy. Fancy.

654
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:27,960
My God, Severide would be
completely busting my balls

655
00:37:28,029 --> 00:37:29,896
about eating in a place like this.

656
00:37:29,964 --> 00:37:33,032
He's always like,
"Lou Malnati's is all I need."

657
00:37:33,101 --> 00:37:34,567
And I'm like, "No, sometimes"

658
00:37:34,636 --> 00:37:37,670
a girl's gotta be wined and dined."

659
00:37:41,075 --> 00:37:44,076
I...

660
00:37:44,145 --> 00:37:48,648
I didn't... I was, that was rude.

661
00:37:48,716 --> 00:37:50,816
Let's talk about you.

662
00:37:50,885 --> 00:37:54,053
No, no, no sweat. It's all good.

663
00:37:58,226 --> 00:38:01,160
Actually, you know what? There is...

664
00:38:01,229 --> 00:38:03,140
There is something I wanted
to talk to you about.

665
00:38:03,164 --> 00:38:05,865
I wasn't sure if it was too soon.

666
00:38:07,835 --> 00:38:10,203
What... what is it?

667
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,507
Okay, well, my sister

668
00:38:14,576 --> 00:38:16,008
is gonna be in town next week.

669
00:38:16,077 --> 00:38:18,678
And she's cool, and I think

670
00:38:18,746 --> 00:38:21,347
you'd like each other so...

671
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:26,752
I wanted to know
if you want to meet her?

672
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,755
Of course. Yes.

673
00:38:29,824 --> 00:38:32,258
Yes, I would love to.

674
00:38:34,862 --> 00:38:37,430
Good.

675
00:38:57,986 --> 00:39:00,486
- Hey. What's up?
- I tried to text you.

676
00:39:00,555 --> 00:39:02,121
My phone's on the charger.

677
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,590
Just seeing if you were around.

678
00:39:04,659 --> 00:39:06,525
Yeah, come on in.

679
00:39:09,564 --> 00:39:12,498
Did Kelly get stood up tonight?

680
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:13,766
Nah, I just wanted to hang

681
00:39:13,835 --> 00:39:15,468
with the old married couple tonight.

682
00:39:15,536 --> 00:39:17,136
So sweet.

683
00:39:17,205 --> 00:39:19,272
- I'll grab the wine.
- Beer?

684
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,941
- I will grab the beers.
- Yeah.

685
00:39:27,315 --> 00:39:28,948
You all right?

686
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,250
Yeah.

687
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:35,588
Thank you.

688
00:39:35,657 --> 00:39:37,490
Thanks, babe.

689
00:39:37,558 --> 00:39:39,358
Cheers, guys.

1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,230
How long you staying, pop?

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:04,670
- Depends.
- Depends on what?

3
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:06,205
I'm stage 4.

4
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:08,173
Just gave me about
four months to live.

5
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:11,110
Look, Leslie Shay wasn't just
some victim in this fire.

6
00:00:11,112 --> 00:00:13,245
She was my partner
and his best friend.

7
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:14,313
No guarantees, all right?

8
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:16,015
But let me see if I can
take a look.

9
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,253
Dawson.

10
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:23,222
Oh, my God.
This was arson.

11
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:24,623
Which would mean the Shay
was murdered,

12
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,026
and whoever did it
is still out there.

13
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:32,264
So where on the scene
did you find this?

14
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:33,499
Buried into the ground

15
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:35,701
between the burn pattern
and the propane tanks.

16
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,069
Under some debris.

17
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:38,337
Did you get pictures?

18
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:42,908
So you removed this
from the scene

19
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,542
without documenting
its original location?

20
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,111
You said you
couldn't investigate

21
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:47,279
further without evidence.

22
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:49,348
I just brought you evidence.

23
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,520
Okay.

24
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:56,822
You're right.
Thank you.

25
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:57,823
So what now?

26
00:00:57,825 --> 00:01:00,159
Now, let me do my job.

27
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:01,226
You wait to hear from me.

28
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,103
Joey,
 can you get it?

29
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:12,171
Yeah, sure.

30
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:21,213
Uh, hi.

31
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:22,748
Baba!

35
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,763
This is my grandma!

36
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,231
This is your grandma?

37
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:41,200
Yes, man.
She's staying with us.

38
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:43,836
I texted you this.

39
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:45,671
You did not
 text me this.

40
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:47,339
A month ago.
I texted you.

41
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:49,641
A month requires
an email.

42
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:51,243
Does she
 even speak English?

43
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:52,644
Not a word.

44
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,249
I can't believe it.

45
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:59,284
What if we hadn't gotten called
to that storage unit?

46
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,352
We never
 would've known.

47
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:02,688
Things happen
 for a reason, fellas.

48
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,356
I believe that.

49
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:07,726
Gabby.

50
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,328
Megan. Hey.

51
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,233
I got on the first plane.

52
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:17,336
Guys, you remember Megan,
Leslie's sister.

53
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:19,404
Of course.
Welcome back to Chicago.

54
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:25,277
Really glad
you could make it out.

55
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:27,179
I can't believe this is
really happening.

56
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:29,281
Arson?

57
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:30,749
Looking more and more
like it.

58
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,851
So Leslie was murdered?

59
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:38,190
Office of Fire
Investigation...

60
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:41,326
They're...
They're looking into it.

61
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,427
Megan...

62
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:45,631
Welcome back to 51.

63
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,236
Thanks, Chief Boden.

64
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:53,772
Kelly, you have a phone call
in my office.

65
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,207
It's Kevin Hadley.

66
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,310
What?

67
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:00,379
What's that son-of-a-bitch
want?

68
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:02,214
It's collect call
from Stateville Penitentiary.

69
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:03,782
He'll only talk to Kelly.

70
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:20,199
What do you want, Hadley?

71
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:21,333
Aren't you going to ask me
how I'm doing?

72
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:22,334
No.

73
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:24,570
Well,
 I'm doing fine.

74
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:26,138
Thank you.

75
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,705
And I want to invite you
to come visit me.

76
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,907
See for yourself.

77
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,442
I'll pass, thanks.

78
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:31,877
Okay.

79
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,212
But...

80
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:35,948
that fire
 that killed Shay?

81
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:41,787
You're just realizing
it was arson, aren't you?

82
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:51,230
Got your
 attention now, huh?

83
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:54,299
Come see me in person.

84
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:56,268
Just you.

Sync and corrected by
Gianluca Belfiglio

87
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,452
Get on with it.

88
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:53,025
You never did have
any patience.

89
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:54,359
You're out of your mind.

90
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:57,062
Am I?

91
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:59,865
Or did I get something
in the mail

92
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,900
that you're gonna want
to see?

93
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:07,372
But first...

94
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:10,776
I want you to get me
a new mattress.

95
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:16,782
They got special mattresses
for people in chronic pain.

96
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:19,318
And the warden
won't order me one.

97
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:23,789
Kevin...

98
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,758
I don't know the warden.

99
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,026
And I'm not
the district attorney,

100
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,929
looking to make a deal.

101
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:55,120
That came out of the blue.

102
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:56,722
I don't know who.

103
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:59,591
There was no name
on the envelope.

104
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:03,528
On the envelope...

105
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,498
there is
 a return address

106
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
and a nice clear
postmark.

107
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,439
Where is it?

108
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:19,544
You get me
 the mattress...

109
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,114
and I'll get you
 the envelope.

110
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,320
Okay, Gabriela,
full disclosure.

111
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,290
I wanted no part of this.

112
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,830
But my parents insisted
that I get out here

113
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,700
and come home with
some answers, so...

114
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,530
I always had it in my head that
it was the job that killed her.

115
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,540
This house...

116
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,570
I could barely walk inside.

117
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,910
Hey. Brett.

118
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,510
This is
 Shay's sister, Megan.

119
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,450
This is Sylvie Brett.
She's the new paramedic on 61.

120
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,420
Great to meet you.

121
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,450
I didn't know your sister,

122
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,460
but everyone says
she was one in a million.

123
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,390
That's true.

124
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,730
My assistant said the hotel
lost my reservation.

125
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,800
You guys don't know
of a place nearby

126
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,370
that doesn't have four locks
on the door?

127
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,200
A hotel? No.

128
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,040
- You're gonna stay with us.
- Yeah.

129
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,010
You guys are
 living together?

130
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,340
What happened to
 you and Matt?

131
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,650
Umm,
we gave it our best shot.

132
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,080
Don't say
 another word.

133
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,920
It's done.
You're staying with us.

134
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
You sure?

135
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,590
Without a doubt.
Come on.

136
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,060
How'd it go?

137
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,390
He... He said someone
sent him something

138
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,560
from Shay's fire.

139
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,370
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

140
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,430
The warden is tossing his cell
right now.

141
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,070
Truck 81,
 squad 3, ambulance 61.

142
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,740
Structure fire.
Randolph and Lasalle.

143
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,920
Find out if there's
anyone inside.

144
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,390
Sometimes these places

145
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,860
lock their cleaning crews
inside at night.

146
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,060
On it, Chief.

147
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,500
Capp, Newhouse.
Get the arc air torches.

148
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Herrmann and Mouch,
load up on spare rods for 'em.

149
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,680
Fire department!
Call out!

150
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,980
Hey, door's locked.

151
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,750
Anyone's inside,
let us know where you are!

152
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,450
Sir!
We need access.

153
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,620
On your side of the door,

154
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,990
there should be a panic bar
that you can press.

155
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,190
Sir!

156
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,800
How much longer?

157
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,670
Another five minutes.

158
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,220
That is not good enough.

159
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,720
Chief.
This is bulletproof glass.

160
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,090
The arc torch would cut
the glass in the window.

161
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,000
If I take off my gear,
I can fit through that frame.

162
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,300
Okay.

163
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,270
Severide, Newhouse,
I need you on the window.

164
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,330
- Come on.
- Let's go.

165
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,850
Pass it to me
once I'm on the other side.

166
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,120
You got it.

167
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,400
Locate the janitor. Get him to
the door. Hit the panic bar.

168
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,930
Right.

169
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,120
I got the victim!
He's alive!

170
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,400
Casey!

171
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
Casey. Report.

172
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,940
Ceiling came down, Chief.

173
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,710
Okay,
can you get through?

174
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,010
Casey.

175
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,010
He's over here.

176
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,020
Hey.

177
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,160
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

178
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,730
You took a couple of good
lungfuls of smoke.

179
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,330
Take a deep breath.

180
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,240
Hey.
Good job in there.

181
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,210
Okay.
You're good.

182
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,380
Damn, baby,
don't scare me like that.

183
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,020
As if she's
 confessing to me,

184
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,960
"I want you to treat me
like a donkey."

185
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,060
You didn't.

186
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,960
Yeah, yes. Yes.

187
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,900
She smacked you?

188
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,030
Yes.

189
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,010
Oh, my God.
I love it.

190
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,390
Hey, listen.

191
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,920
So Saturday is the three-month
anniversary of Sylvie and me.

192
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,390
Yeah, when you become
the beast with two backs.

193
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,060
Our first date.
Look, whatever.

194
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,800
When is grandma leaving,
all right?

195
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,130
'Cause Dawson's still
at Brett's place

196
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,870
and now Shay's sister's
there too,

197
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,470
and I want to invite Sylvie over
to our place.

198
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,470
She's... not.

199
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,810
She's not what?

200
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,910
Baba's moving in with us,
dude.

201
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,480
Yeah!

202
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,080
What?

203
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,780
I texted you this.

204
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,750
You can't text
something like that!

205
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,620
- That's a discussion.
- Hey!

206
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,290
It's not my fault
you don't check your texts.

207
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,190
Joe,
 you know what?

208
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,300
When I wanted to be
a firefighter,

209
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,170
my parents flipped out.

210
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,670
They wanted me to become
a doctor like Vlad and Dimitri.

211
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,300
Now, my grandmother calls me
from Russia

212
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,650
and she says to me,

213
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:20,310
"Your mother moved to America
to follow her dreams.

214
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,180
Now you follow yours."

215
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,280
I'm here because
of my grandma,

216
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,080
so if I have to share a room
with her,

217
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,320
I will.

218
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,840
I'm looking
for Kelly Severide.

219
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,280
Yeah, right here.

220
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,550
I got a delivery
from Warden Aynesworth

221
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,450
at Stateville Penitentiary.

222
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,860
Hey, Chief.

223
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,870
Hey.

224
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,210
So I already looked up
the return address.

225
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,980
It's just a...
just a vacant lot.

226
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,710
I think Hadley is messing
with us.

227
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,720
What?

228
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,370
Chief.

229
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,030
There's no way that Hadley
could've known

230
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,000
about that address.

231
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,400
What do you mean?

232
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,940
That is the fire
where we lost Henry Mills.

233
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,850
It's the fire where
I got burned up myself.

234
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,150
Wha...

235
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,990
So these are connected?

236
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,220
It would seem so.

237
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,130
If the same guy
set both fires,

238
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,250
he's been flying under
the radar for 20 years.

239
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,970
Why try to get
our attention now?

240
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,270
You found his storage unit
and interrupted him.

241
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,840
Meticulous planners like this

242
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,110
don't do well
 with exposure.

243
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,250
So what's gonna be
his next move?

244
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,120
That's the million dollar
question.

245
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,450
But I know he's going
to want control back,

246
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,990
however
 he has to get it.

247
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,190
So what
 do we have here?

248
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,990
Well, there's no way this guy
only started two fires,

249
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:16,990
20 years apart.

250
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,330
Or three.

251
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,130
All signs point
to a serial arsonist.

252
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,900
Which is why
 we're mapping out

253
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,930
any suspected but unsolved
arson fires

254
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,340
during the time period

255
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,400
that used
a similar methodology.

256
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,510
Next we'll check the buildings
for common ownership.

257
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,040
Then we'll look at geography
and calendar groupings.

258
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,780
I think the geography
speaks for itself.

259
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,820
Yeah.
It's a start.

260
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:46,960
You wanted to see me?

261
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,330
Yeah. Come on in.
Have a seat.

262
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,200
Someone,
we don't know who,

263
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,140
sent Kevin Hadley a copy
of an article

264
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,300
about the fire
that killed Shay.

265
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,370
It was one
of the same articles

266
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,510
as was found at
the storage locker.

267
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,960
The return address
on the envelope

268
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,990
was the site
of the McFarland fire

269
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
where your father died.

270
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,210
We don't know anything else.

271
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:39,310
Arson investigation
are looking into it.

272
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:45,920
So it's the same guy?

273
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,420
My dad's fire
 was an arson?

274
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,920
Someone certainly wants us
to think so.

275
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,620
The arsonist.

276
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,030
Maybe.

277
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,100
So... and that's it?

278
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:10,370
You bring me in here,
you drop this on me,

279
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,540
and you give me a
"they're looking into it."

280
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,010
What the hell am I supposed to
do with that information, Chief?

281
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,000
Nothing. For now.

282
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,980
But please understand
how important it is

283
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,920
that you keep
 a clear head.

284
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,050
Keep your distance.
Let everybody do their jobs.

285
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,690
Are you serious?
I... I...

286
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,320
Peter, I promise you,
if this is true,

287
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,660
I will not rest
until justice is served.

288
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,660
I will serve it myself
if I have to.

289
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,600
But I need you to trust me.

290
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,220
That is so her.

291
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,990
It reminds me
of Amy-Lou Schmeckle.

292
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,390
- Mm-hmm.
- That's a real person?

293
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,920
Oh, hand to God.
Leslie's first love.

294
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:02,590
She was the girl who knew about
bands you've never heard of

295
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,130
and movies that only play
at one theater.

296
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,700
And my sister was a knockout,
of course,

297
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,520
and every guy in the school

298
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,330
was just falling all over
themselves to date her.

299
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,240
So one day, I come rushing home,
excited about who knows what,

300
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,170
and I burst into Leslie's room,
because that's what we did,

301
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,980
and there she is,
Leslie with Amy-Lou Schmeckle,

302
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,980
both their shirts off,
kissing.

303
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,480
All I could think of
was screaming "Mom"

304
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,120
at the top of my lungs.

305
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,020
She pulled me
into the room,

306
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,460
and she just looks at me
and she says,

307
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,490
"Sister, we got to talk."

308
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,460
She just laid it all out.

309
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:43,370
"I like girls."
Simple as that.

310
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,010
That was Leslie.

311
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,410
God, I miss her.

312
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,660
Hey, Dawson in?
I need to talk to her.

313
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,160
Yeah, of course.

314
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,030
Megan, you wanna help me

315
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,130
with the finishing touches
on a pear tart?

316
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,200
I want to hear this.

317
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,300
All of these fires were set
by our guy?

318
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,070
Right now it's just a theory,
but the MOs match.

319
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,440
How many had fatalities?

320
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,170
Four more.

321
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:29,550
If he's an excitement arsonist,
then he's in it for the chaos.

322
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,550
He doesn't set out to kill,
but he doesn't care if he does.

323
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:35,120
So
 what do we do?

324
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,050
Cunningham said she's on it.

325
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,060
Which one killed Leslie?

326
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:49,300
That one.

327
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,410
You better find
that son of a bitch

328
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,140
and make him pay.

329
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,080
She's got this...

330
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,350
I don't know if "innocence"
is the right word,

331
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,760
but earnestness about
the way that she does her job.

332
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,590
And not everybody was crazy
about her at the beginning,

333
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,360
trust me,

334
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,560
but it wasn't Sylvie's fault.

335
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,650
She was replacing Shay,

336
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,730
and how's anybody
supposed to do that?

337
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,540
It's like God looked down
on me and he said,

338
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,740
"Joe, you've been
through enough.

339
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,140
You deserve more."

340
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,740
What are you doing?

341
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,840
Talking to Baba.

342
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,510
You know she doesn't understand
a word you're saying.

343
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:39,120
I know.

344
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,580
It's perfect.

345
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,290
Okay, Baba.

346
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,800
Okay, Baba.

347
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,020
Oh, hey, Megan, you should
 ride with Brett and Mills today.

348
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,450
You can see what your
sister's world was about.

349
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,590
Oh, tempting,

350
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,720
but I actually should do some
work on some client files.

351
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:09,330
Ambulance 61,
man in distress...

352
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:13,570
Not a second thought.
You're ours.

353
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,620
Police!

354
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,020
Police! Police!

355
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,290
Police! Police!

356
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,290
Hey, I don't wanna hurt
anybody.

357
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,760
Ma'am, did you call 911?

358
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,590
He's been standing out here
for 20 minutes.

359
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,400
Kept telling me to call
the police, which I did.

360
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,400
So they sent an ambulance.

361
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,670
- This city...
- Police!

362
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,630
Why do you need
 the police, sir?

363
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,300
He's got mental problems,
obviously.

364
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,540
- Okay.
- Sir, are you injured?

365
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,270
I'm telling you that I don't
want to hurt anyone.

366
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,880
And I told her
to call the cops

367
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,510
before something
 bad happens!

368
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,780
I'm calling in a 10-1.

369
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,510
Wait, just hold up.

370
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,120
Sir.

371
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,650
What's going on with you?

372
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,500
We're calling the police,

373
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,910
but if there's a way that
we can help, let us know.

374
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,540
You can help me
by calling the cops!

375
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,180
Okay,
are you on any medication?

376
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,450
Police!
Police! Police!

377
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:19,550
Hey, dispatch, we need police
here at 1200 Hastings.

378
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,920
We got a man here
with mental distress.

379
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,220
Why is nobody listening
to me?

380
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,920
Hey!

381
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:35,530
I'm so, so sorry.

382
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,930
I know you don't want
to hurt me.

383
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,470
No, but I have to.

384
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,740
Come on.

385
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,610
Tell them
I'm armed and dangerous.

386
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,380
Say it just like that.

387
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,650
Armed and dangerous.

388
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:51,680
All right, nut job.
I got it.

389
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,390
Hey.
What'd he do?

390
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,820
He came at me
 with a knife.

391
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,690
- It's right there.
- Got it.

392
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,590
Yeah,
he's armed and dangerous.

393
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,460
Thank you.

394
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,830
What?

395
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,460
It's a parole violation.

396
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,630
I'm not cut out for the outside.

397
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,700
Come on. Let's go.

398
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:14,740
All right, people,
nothing to see.

399
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,440
Hey.
You okay?

400
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,740
Yeah. You?

401
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,810
Yeah, of course.

402
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:26,720
Yo.

403
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,790
Megan, you okay?

404
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,320
I... I'm fine, really.

405
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,560
That was par for the course.

406
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,830
Not even in the top ten
of scary calls. Trust me.

407
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:43,330
That's what she did.

408
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,800
She went through
 that every day,

409
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,640
and she never
said anything to me.

410
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,290
I'd ask her how her day was,

411
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,940
and she would just make
some inappropriate joke

412
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,780
to get me laughing.

413
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,850
I had no idea.

414
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,750
Listen....

415
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,720
that is the way
 that shay was.

416
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,810
I mean, she never wanted anyone
to waste any time

417
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,740
worrying about her.

418
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,810
She just wanted to make
everyone smile.

419
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,620
Yeah, yeah.
She did.

420
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:21,620
Let's go back to the house,

421
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,790
get some hot chocolate.

422
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,530
I'm glad I came.

423
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,100
Come on.

424
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,540
I don't even understand
where Baba's sleeping.

425
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,940
I have bunk beds.

426
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,540
You put the babushka
on a bunk?

427
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,250
She grew up
 sleeping in a barn.

428
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,920
And it's not like I make her
sleep on the top bunk...

429
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,920
most nights.

430
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,920
Look, I'll admit that Baba
has her certain charms,

431
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,050
but you gotta take her out
to dinner

432
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,190
or something tomorrow night,
all right?

433
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,560
Sylvie's coming at 9:00 pm,

434
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,530
and you will not
ruin this for me.

435
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,860
I'm telling you,
it's zero problem, man.

436
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,100
Baba goes to sleep
at 8:00 pm.

437
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,730
You won't even know
she's there.

438
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,270
Yeah!

439
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,900
Have you guys seen
Kelly Severide?

440
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,170
Yes, Captain.

441
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,040
I think I saw him
in Boden's office.

442
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,210
Head inside
and hook a left.

443
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,510
Okay, thanks.

444
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,180
- Captain.
- Afternoon, Captain.

445
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,580
Afternoon.

446
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,280
Come on, now.
Don't get nervous.

447
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,680
- Wow.
- You got nervous.

448
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,820
You've played this before,
right?

449
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,860
Come in.

450
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:35,630
Hey.

451
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,760
I've pulled a bunch of photos
of arsonists

452
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,160
we've suspected
 over the years

453
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,730
but haven't been able
to prosecute.

454
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,870
Do you mind if I borrow Kelly
for an hour?

455
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,940
What for?

456
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,610
Intimidation.

457
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,750
None of these guys have rented
a storage unit from me.

458
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,680
Nope.

459
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,290
That guy
 looks crazy, but nope.

460
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,660
Okay. I'm gonna need you
to concentrate.

461
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,290
Any faces that look even
vaguely familiar

462
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,360
might help us to narrow
this down.

463
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,760
Sure, sure.

464
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,300
Look I show 'em a space,

465
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,860
get a credit card,
and forget 'em.

466
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,970
It's not like there's
a lot of personal...

467
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,170
Hold on.

468
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:19,910
This one?

469
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,970
This guy...

470
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,040
He's a...
He's a customer here.

471
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,780
His chin is stronger, like
maybe he gained some weight.

472
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:30,880
But I recognize that guy.
No doubt.

473
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,620
You're sure?

474
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,790
He rents a space here.
I'm sure of it.

475
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,130
Adrian Gish. 47.

476
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,830
Twice accused of arson.

477
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,160
Cleared both times.

478
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,230
And he lives right
in the middle of the hot zone.

479
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,740
My predecessor had him in
twice for questioning.

480
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,670
He came in voluntarily.

481
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,870
But there wasn't a sniff
of proof

482
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,910
and the department decided
not to pursue.

483
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:58,080
Last we heard,
he works here.

484
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,060
So we arrest him.

485
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,770
We ask him
 to come in again,

486
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:03,830
have a conversation with him.

487
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,600
See if he'll go on the record.

488
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,470
- You let me do the talking.
- Yeah.

489
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:09,710
Excuse me.

490
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,470
I'm sorry to interrupt
your conversation,

491
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,610
but are you a firefighter?

492
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:15,740
Yeah, I am.

493
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:19,950
I thought I recognized you
from the news.

494
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:24,150
Terrible collapse
a few months ago.

495
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,790
Another firefighter
was killed, right?

496
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,630
A paramedic?

497
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,660
Horrible, horrible tragedy,

498
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,970
just... just awful.

499
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:38,630
Lunch break.

500
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,040
What's your name?

501
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,810
You already know that.

502
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,710
Okay, fine.
Adrian.

503
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,680
You mind if we ask you
some questions

504
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,880
somewhere more private?

505
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,080
Oh, man.
I wish I could.

506
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,950
But my break's
 almost over. So...

507
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,930
Did you start the fire?

508
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:05,760
Let me ask you a question,
hmm?

509
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:10,300
What'd you have to do
to become a firefighter, huh?

510
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,670
Have to take a lot of tests?

511
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,070
Hold your breath
 a long time?

512
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,800
I can do that.

513
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:18,310
Maybe I can get
an application.

514
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,310
Yeah, sure,
come on by 51.

515
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,910
We'll get you one.

516
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,210
- Then we'll talk.
- Kelly.

517
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:25,810
No, he wants to get something
off his chest, let's let him.

518
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,120
Huh?
Right, Adrian?

519
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,020
All done.

520
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,090
It was nice meeting you two.

521
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:35,990
Oh.

522
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,330
Please accept
 my condolences

523
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:40,630
on the loss
 of your paramedic.

524
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:44,670
Now that I think about it,
her name was Shay, right?

525
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:50,870
She was really pretty.

526
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,740
Photogenic.

527
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,680
No, Kelly.

528
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,750
Not like this.

529
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,240
It's not like we get
 a lot of sleep on shift,

530
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,130
but this is the place.

531
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,900
It's nicer
than I pictured.

532
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,130
Trust me, you get 20 guys
in here

533
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:19,340
snoring and blowing gas
all night,

534
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,340
it's a different story.

535
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,910
This was Leslie's.

536
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,220
I...
I don't need to...

537
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:49,100
First day,
she waltzes in here,

538
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,200
drops her stuff,

539
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,340
strips down
bare-ass nude

540
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:58,210
and walks to the shower.

541
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,940
No one knew what to do.

542
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:09,080
We miss her, Megan.

543
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:12,350
She was the heartbeat of...

544
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,370
We all move on, right?

545
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,740
But you never forget.

546
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,080
Not a girl like Shay.

547
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,920
I'm doing a bang-up job of
making you feel better, huh?

548
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:49,690
Actually, you are, Chris.

549
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:50,960
Thank you.

550
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,830
Hey, guys.
It's time.

551
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,740
Time for what?

552
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,170
You're gonna want to see this.

553
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,310
I have a love-hate relationship
 with these ceremonies.

554
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,480
Each one is a reminder

555
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,250
that we've lost a member
of our family.

556
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:51,290
Leslie Shay
was a great paramedic.

557
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:54,190
There are no words that can
fill the hole that she left.

558
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,390
The woman
 who rode alongside her

559
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,960
from her first day to her last,
Gabriela Dawson,

560
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,360
would like to say
 some words.

561
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,780
A lot's changed at 51

562
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:19,150
since losing Shay.

563
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:22,280
We've welcomed in
 new friends,

564
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:25,220
we got a new rig...

565
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:28,420
and, uh...

566
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:32,390
and a dream
 of mine came true.

567
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,230
But here's what
hasn't changed:

568
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:39,300
this house,

569
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:43,140
this family...

570
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,340
It's all as strong
as it ever was...

571
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:50,150
Stronger even,

572
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:54,450
because I think, um...

573
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:59,350
I think that deep down
in the quiet moments

574
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,160
we think to ourselves:

575
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,360
Shay would want us
to be better.

576
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:08,030
She'd want us to lean
on each other.

577
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,900
And she'd want us to represent
her, every time we go out.

578
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:19,370
You had an amazing sister,
Megan.

579
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:24,310
And I'm so lucky to have been
her friend.

580
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:05,020
51 will always be
Leslie Shay's home.

581
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:09,290
The people in it
will always be her family.

582
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:12,590
Detail! Attent...

583
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,060
Huh!

584
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:20,070
Present arms!

585
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:41,960
Order arms!

586
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:15,360
I really appreciated
what you said today.

587
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,660
I'm sure
 Megan did too.

588
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,430
Hardest thing I've had to do
in a long time.

589
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:24,030
I thought you handled it
brilliantly.

590
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,370
Did we blow it?

591
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:36,710
Yeah.

592
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,620
Or I did.
I don't know.

593
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,260
I just... I wanted to be
a candidate so badly.

594
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:56,130
I'm sorry.

595
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:59,400
I'm sorry too.

596
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,570
But, you know,
you're a hell of a firefighter

597
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:06,380
and I'm not sorry I'm the one
who gets to lead you.

598
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,410
And I get to look out
for you too,

599
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,480
if I'm being honest.

600
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:19,450
Can...

601
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,460
Can we just put us
on hold?

602
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:25,630
Maybe we can see where we are,
with work, with life

603
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:28,360
down the road?

604
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:30,370
Maybe then
 we can start new.

605
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,040
Yeah, I'd like that.

606
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:42,810
Oh, hey, did you...

607
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:46,420
Wait, hear that Otis's grandma
moved in with him?

608
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,280
What?

609
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,280
Yeah.

610
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:51,050
And she sleeps
in the bunk bed.

611
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,220
On top?

612
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,320
I mean, he says no,

613
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,120
but you know Otis and
his small bladder.

614
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,300
Come in.

615
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,570
I brought tequila.

616
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:11,340
Oh!

617
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:14,110
I usually bring wine.

618
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,710
But I thought,

619
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,350
why not mix it up?

620
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:19,450
And the guy from
the liquor store

621
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:22,850
said this was
 the good stuff.

622
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:25,350
Yes, it is.

623
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,360
Let me take your coat.

624
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,290
So I thought we could
watch a movie or something.

625
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,360
Really?

626
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:37,200
Bad idea.

627
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,170
It is our three-month
anniversary, Joe.

628
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,670
We can officially
drop pretending

629
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,410
to watch movies.

630
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,450
Oh!

631
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:02,490
Baba! Ha. Uh...

632
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,390
It's Otis's grandmother.

633
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:06,530
She's staying with us.

634
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,800
Baba,
it's really late.

635
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,530
Don't you want to go
to bed?

636
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,470
Um, I'm gonna go find
some glasses.

637
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,490
Now this,
this is a good place.

638
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,890
Yes, it is.

639
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:38,260
Another round?

640
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,660
What's that?

641
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,830
Medication time.

642
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:51,510
Nah, forget it.

643
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:54,380
Forget what?

644
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:59,310
This one
 makes me sleepy,

645
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,220
this one
 keeps me awake,

646
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,490
and this one twists up
my stomach,

647
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:07,490
and I just can't...
I can't do this anymore.

648
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:09,590
Pops...

649
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,590
I mean...

650
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,260
I mean, what the hell
is a couple more months

651
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,660
if I'm too sick to enjoy it?

652
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,500
I wanna go out
on my own terms.

653
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,810
You ain't going anywhere.

654
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:39,250
- You know what I'm thinking.
- What?

655
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,220
We're gonna
 throw a party.

656
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:44,930
A party like I used
to throw.

657
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:47,360
We're gonna
 throw you a party.

658
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,700
We're gonna
throw you a party.

659
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,840
But you have got
to keep taking your pills.

660
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,950
Fine.

661
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:09,850
Deal.

662
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:14,620
Trust me when I say I need
to do this near a toilet.

663
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,960
TMI, pops.
TMI.

664
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:24,430
Don't go halfway
on this, son.

665
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,630
I won't, pops.

666
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:31,440
I won't.

667
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:37,610
Chief.
How's he doing?

668
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:39,780
It's gonna take more than cancer
to take him out,

669
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,850
that much I know.

670
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,420
Hey.

671
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,020
What's going on?

672
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,920
I have some bad news.

673
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:52,930
Unfortunately,
OFI has decided

674
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:56,670
not to pursue Adrian Gish
at this time.

675
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:58,030
What?

676
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,800
It wasn't my decision.

677
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,340
I'm sorry.

678
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,810
But we found the guy.

679
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:05,570
The storage unit dude
identified him,

680
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,880
and he all but admitted it.

681
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,780
All it does is tie Gish
to the storage unit.

682
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,480
We can't prove it was his
or he was there.

683
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,480
It was full of accelerants
and stuff about Shay.

684
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,080
Believe me, I wish I could give
you a different answer,

685
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:17,020
but I can't.

686
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,590
My boss has been doing this
for a long time.

687
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,720
He knows what cases
will stick.

688
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,420
This one won't.

689
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:23,460
At least not yet.

690
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,330
What does
 "not yet" mean?

691
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:26,530
The case is still open.

692
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:28,560
Gish is on our radar.

693
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,370
We'll have to wait and see.

694
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,530
Yeah, until he kills
somebody again.

695
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,370
Until he makes a mistake.

696
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,740
Unbelievable.

697
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,340
I'm sorry.

698
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,510
What does this mean?

699
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,530
Hey, it's Gabby.

700
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:58,860
I need your help.

701
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:01,500
We all do.

702
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,600
Sure, sis.

703
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,000
Whatever you need.

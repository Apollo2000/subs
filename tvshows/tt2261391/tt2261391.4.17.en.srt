What, relax. It was a personal call.

168
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,295
I got problems with
the Barney rental I got

169
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,829
for Annabelle's birthday party.

170
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:37,331
Oh, that's so sweet.
How old is she gonna be?

171
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:39,967
Eight.

172
00:08:40,002 --> 00:08:41,602
You get what you get,
and you don't get upset.

173
00:08:41,637 --> 00:08:44,905
Now this jagoff is saying
that he's double booked.

174
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,573
- You know, I got a guy.
- Yeah?

175
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,142
He's a musician,

176
00:08:48,177 --> 00:08:51,345
looking to make the switch
to, you know, kid-friendly.

177
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,513
What kind of musician?

178
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:53,681
Like pop punk.

179
00:08:53,716 --> 00:08:56,684
Like the kind of band
your ex-husband is in?

180
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:58,185
- Yeah.
- Okay, listen.

181
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,120
Grant is trying to start over.

182
00:09:00,156 --> 00:09:02,356
He just needs a chance to break in.

183
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:04,024
Why would you break up with the guy

184
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,125
and then try to take care of him?

185
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:06,527
Be glad you don't know.

186
00:09:06,562 --> 00:09:07,861
Herrmann, please.

187
00:09:07,897 --> 00:09:10,531
Stella, I can't hire your broken-down ex

188
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:12,199

189
00:09:12,234 --> 00:09:14,668
He'll do it for free, as
long as he gets to record it.

190
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:17,204
Deal.

191

Chief's looking for you.

And... heads up, Chief Tiberg is with him.

218
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:38,519
The CFD won't tolerate

219
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,587
a double-dipping firefighter in our ranks.

220
00:10:40,623 --> 00:10:42,589
I understand, sir.

221
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,958
That's why I'll defer
the alderman's salary

Are you sure that's what you want to do?

224
00:10:48,764 --> 00:10:50,431
Because that sort of
thing you can't take back.

225
00:10:50,466 --> 00:10:52,633
I'm not doing this for the money.

226
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:53,901
Especially if it means

227
00:10:53,936 --> 00:10:55,869
accepting it would jeopardize
me being a firefighter.

228
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,639
So you plan to stay on
active duty, even if you win?

229
00:10:58,674 --> 00:10:59,740
Yes, sir.

230
00:10:59,775 --> 00:11:03,110
As you know, most firefighters
have other jobs on their off days.

231
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:06,146
I've run a successful construction
business for ten years.

232
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:07,314
Lieutenant Casey has not missed a beat

233
00:11:07,349 --> 00:11:08,348
since the campaign began, Chief.

234
00:11:08,384 --> 00:11:10,017
- No?
- No.

235
00:11:10,052 --> 00:11:13,654
I've reviewed 51's company journal.

236
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:16,023
How many shifts would
you say that you switched

237
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:17,958
or stepped out on since
starting your campaign?

238
00:11:17,993 --> 00:11:19,159
Too many.

239
00:11:19,195 --> 00:11:20,894
But the campaign events are done with.

240
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,397
It's not gonna be a problem going forward.

241
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,765
I'm holding you to that.

Owners of the house were up in Kenosha.

245
00:11:45,855 --> 00:11:47,855
They just moved in five months ago.

246

M.E. thinks the Baby Doe's
been there a few years.

Clothes were stripped and we
don't have any dental matches.

Yes, of course.

Well, I'm pretty damn sure it was her body

263

that we found in the chimney.

264

Who's Courtney Harris?

265
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:53,405
Little girl, wandered away
from her parents' lake house

266
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:55,741
in North Kenwood during a party.

267
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:56,876
Ended up drowning.

We were off shift, but Chief,

271
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:04,016
everyone here on Squad went
out to help out in the search.

272
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:05,718
Squad lieutenant called
it off on day three,

273
00:13:05,753 --> 00:13:08,420
figured the current had pushed
the body out to deeper water.

274
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:09,522
Courtney's description

275
00:13:09,557 --> 00:13:11,457
included a Saint Nicholas pendant.

276
00:13:11,492 --> 00:13:13,993
I remember because her mom told me.

277
00:13:16,764 --> 00:13:18,397
That's it, Chief.

278
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:20,533
That's her necklace.

279
00:13:20,568 --> 00:13:22,168
North Kenwood is over ten miles away

Well, then, somebody
transported the body, obviously.

I'm telling you, it's her.

283

That's why we never found her.

So how long has Grant
been playing kids' music?

289
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:54,633
He hasn't.

but this is what he needs.

293
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:02,741
And what is he currently doing now?

294
00:14:02,777 --> 00:14:05,778

So, that's Amy Bell, from the "Sun-Times,"

329
00:15:24,225 --> 00:15:26,792
so you can get the word out
about the double-dipping thing.

330
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:27,793
- Amy Bell.
- Hi.

331
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:29,261
"Sun-Times." Great to meet you.

332
00:15:29,297 --> 00:15:31,130
Matt Casey. Thanks for coming over.

333
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:34,633
Gabriela said you had some
news regarding your campaign?

334
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:36,268
I wanted to announce

335
00:15:36,304 --> 00:15:39,104
I'll be deferring the
alderman's salary if elected.

336
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,006
And what inspired that decision?

337
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:42,841
There's still families Alderman Becks

338
00:15:42,877 --> 00:15:44,810
hasn't helped out after the tornado.

339
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:46,812
They need it more than I do.

340
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:48,017
Is that one of the issues

341
00:15:48,052 --> 00:15:49,852
you'll be bringing up in the final debate?

342
00:15:49,887 --> 00:15:52,721
The final debate was last week.

343
00:15:52,757 --> 00:15:54,957
Alderman Becks' campaign told us

344
00:15:54,992 --> 00:15:58,594
one more debate was being
set right before the election.

345
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:02,631
Um... this is the first I've heard of it.

346
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,233
Do you mind if we go inside to talk?

347
00:16:04,268 --> 00:16:05,401
I'm freezing.

348
00:16:05,436 --> 00:16:07,102
I do, actually.

349
00:16:07,138 --> 00:16:09,171
This is my real job. We're running drills.

350
00:16:09,206 --> 00:16:13,175
So, being an alderman
isn't a real job to you?

00:16:19,884 --> 00:16:21,383
Okay.

354
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:23,652
I'll pop back around

355
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:24,953
Sure.

356
00:16:24,989 --> 00:16:26,321
Yeah.

Hey, Lieutenant.

363
00:16:38,502 --> 00:16:40,803
Squad 4 sent this incident
report over for you.

364
00:16:40,838 --> 00:16:42,738

six years old, though.

366
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:48,944
Courtney Harris.

367
00:16:48,979 --> 00:16:51,180
This got anything to do
with the Baby Doe we found?

368
00:16:51,215 --> 00:16:52,815
Maybe.

369
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,117
Oh, yeah. I remember this case.

370
00:16:55,152 --> 00:16:56,919
Yeah, from reading the newspaper.

371
00:16:56,954 --> 00:16:58,620
But we were in the lake.

372
00:16:58,656 --> 00:17:02,024
Well, excuse me for not being
Squad-certified back then, Capp.

373
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:03,425
Let's go gas up.

374
00:17:03,461 --> 00:17:05,561
Let's go.

375
00:17:11,068 --> 00:17:13,802
I got a copy of Squad 4's
report on Courtney Harris.

376
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:15,204
It mentions a fight on the docks.

377
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:17,039
It was between Courtney's
dad and her uncle.

378
00:17:17,074 --> 00:17:18,273
It may not be anything,

379
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:20,709
but I figured you'd want
to take a look at it.

380
00:17:20,744 --> 00:17:22,578
I just got an update from the M.E.

381
00:17:22,613 --> 00:17:24,580
She determined the cause of death.

382
00:17:24,615 --> 00:17:26,815
Someone snapped Baby Doe's neck in half.

383
00:17:29,186 --> 00:17:30,419
So what's next?

384
00:17:30,454 --> 00:17:31,420
A lot of things.

385
00:17:31,455 --> 00:17:32,721
And I've been trying to

386
00:17:32,756 --> 00:17:34,823
get a hold of Courtney
Harris's parents, but no luck.

387
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:36,592
Their numbers have changed
a few times apparently.

388
00:17:36,627 --> 00:17:37,893
I can look into that.

389
00:17:37,928 --> 00:17:40,496
Like I said, I know a lot
of people in that area.

390
00:17:40,531 --> 00:17:41,530
Yeah, if you could get me their numbers,

391
00:17:41,565 --> 00:17:42,764
that would be great.

392
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,033
We need to match their
DNA against the Baby Doe's.

393
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:46,368
You don't need to keep
calling her Baby Doe.

394
00:17:46,403 --> 00:17:48,770
I'm telling you, this is Courtney Harris.

395
00:17:48,806 --> 00:17:49,838
Time will tell.

396
00:17:49,874 --> 00:17:51,006
How much time?

397
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,542
I've got it from here, Lieutenant.

398
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,550
That's Courtney Harris.

399
00:18:13,998 --> 00:18:16,932
Hey, Grant emailed me.

400
00:18:18,435 --> 00:18:19,968
He's super excited.

401
00:18:20,004 --> 00:18:21,870
Yeah, he seems it.

It's a list of requests.

406
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:35,517
Separate room to change, with a shower.

407

- What...
- Sparkling water, iced.

408
00:18:37,688 --> 00:18:39,855
Six-pack of beer, iced.

409

- Aahp.

You know what, just don't
even worry about any of that.

414
00:18:48,032 --> 00:18:51,400
Just carve out a little
space for him to perform,

415
00:18:51,435 --> 00:18:53,535
and he'll be there.

416
00:18:53,571 --> 00:18:56,338
I guarantee it.

417
00:18:56,373 --> 00:18:57,773
Well, Amy was right.

of Neighborhood Development,

419

put the debate together
and they're claiming

420
00:19:02,413 --> 00:19:04,580
that one of their interns
forgot to notify us.

421
00:19:04,615 --> 00:19:05,981
When?

422
00:19:06,016 --> 00:19:07,082
During next shift.

00:19:07,117 --> 00:19:08,383
6:00 p.m.

We move it, Becks spins
it to make us look bad.

427
00:19:14,191 --> 00:19:15,924
Hey, we got you covered here, Lieutenant.

428
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,226
Yeah, I appreciate that,

429
00:19:17,261 --> 00:19:19,094
but I gave Chief Tiberg my word.

430
00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:23,031
This debate is your last shot
to get voters back on your side.

431
00:19:23,067 --> 00:19:26,068
You skip this, you're
handing Becks the win.

432
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,105
So be it.

433
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,707
Matt, it's one shift.

No, it's way more than that.

435

When everyone here talked
me into running for alderman,

436
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,946
I was told it was a side job.

I've done the cocktail parties,
I've gotten the message out.

439
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:47,556
I had to prevent myself
from kicking Becks' teeth in

440
00:19:47,591 --> 00:19:49,558
when he dragged me and my
mom's name through the mud.

- If that's not enough

442
00:19:50,661 --> 00:19:54,796
at this point, then it's a wrap.

447
00:20:07,778 --> 00:20:09,311
At least he's got a job.

448
00:20:09,346 --> 00:20:12,014
He's so close and he's worked so hard

449
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:13,915

The Harrises used to live a
couple streets over from my uncle.

They used to go to his

I was helping her dad at the grill

while she and my little
cousin played in the backyard.

this really nice house on the corner.

553

They were always planting flowers

or taking care of the lawn.

555
00:24:59,608 --> 00:25:02,709

called off, they stopped.

00:38:10,382 --> 00:38:12,415
We're getting the band back together.

822
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:15,418
<i>[tense music]</i>

823
00:38:23,995 --> 00:38:26,596
You go and you knock 'em dead, Grant.

824
00:38:26,711 --> 00:38:29,212
No. No.

825
00:38:29,247 --> 00:38:30,913
Not now. Not...

826
00:38:30,949 --> 00:38:34,450
Please, not like this. Why...

827
00:38:45,797 --> 00:38:47,430
Hey, when did the polls close?

828
00:38:47,465 --> 00:38:48,965
Hey. An hour ago.

829
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,235
Okay, so I know a guy
counting ballots in your ward.

830
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:54,570
He said you were looking pretty good.

831
00:38:54,606 --> 00:38:56,272
Oh, my gosh, this is nuts.

832
00:38:56,307 --> 00:38:57,673
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

833
00:38:57,709 --> 00:39:00,376
And I don't care if that's
negative anticipation,

834
00:39:00,411 --> 00:39:03,145
or whatever it's called.

835
00:39:03,181 --> 00:39:05,581
Hey, you didn't have to do that.

836
00:39:05,617 --> 00:39:07,884
Come on, you're my guy.

837
00:39:07,919 --> 00:39:09,051
Hi.

838
00:39:09,087 --> 00:39:10,720
This is so exciting.

839
00:39:10,755 --> 00:39:13,356
We're just drinking beer right
now, that's all we're doing.

840
00:39:13,391 --> 00:39:14,357
Yeah.

841
00:39:14,392 --> 00:39:17,393
[phone ringing]

842
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:22,164
- Answer it!
- Okay, okay.

843
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,166
Hello?

844
00:39:24,202 --> 00:39:25,868
[bar music playing]

845
00:39:25,904 --> 00:39:30,039
Wow, well, it's been a hell of a ride.

846
00:39:30,074 --> 00:39:33,042
Yeah, thanks for the call.

847
00:39:38,249 --> 00:39:39,215
[laughs]

848
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,716
I won.

849
00:39:40,752 --> 00:39:42,418
[cheers and applause]

850
00:39:42,453 --> 00:39:43,886
What, you won?

851
00:39:43,922 --> 00:39:46,489
Yeah!

852
00:39:46,524 --> 00:39:47,490
Yes!

853
00:39:47,525 --> 00:39:51,327
[cheers and applause]

854
00:39:51,362 --> 00:39:52,995
Congratulations.

855
00:39:53,031 --> 00:39:55,665
I've never kissed an alderman before.

856
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:00,269
All: Casey! Casey! Casey! Casey! Casey!

857
00:40:00,305 --> 00:40:03,773
[cheering]

858
00:40:03,808 --> 00:40:06,809
Yeah!

859
00:40:11,015 --> 00:40:13,282
I knew it, I knew it.

860
00:40:13,318 --> 00:40:15,051
God, Baby, I'm so proud of you.

861
00:40:15,086 --> 00:40:18,354
Thanks so much for believing in me.

862
00:40:18,389 --> 00:40:21,190
[exhales]

863
00:40:21,225 --> 00:40:22,792
Now what?

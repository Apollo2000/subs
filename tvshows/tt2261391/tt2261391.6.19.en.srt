1
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,337
<i>That boy...</i>

2
00:00:07,371 --> 00:00:08,739
<i>We really did a number on him.</i>

3
00:00:08,771 --> 00:00:10,613
The moods, the women.

4
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:12,293
When things get a little rough,

5
00:00:12,326 --> 00:00:14,543
- don't give up.
- Yeah...

6
00:00:14,606 --> 00:00:16,660
<i>I hope me being here isn't making things</i>

7
00:00:16,693 --> 00:00:18,495
<i>awkward for you and Captain Casey.</i>

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,129
He knows that the thing
between us was nothing.

9
00:00:20,192 --> 00:00:21,593
It wasn't nothing to me.

10
00:00:23,395 --> 00:00:25,298
<i>I am at that rehab
facility every morning</i>

11
00:00:25,331 --> 00:00:27,400
<i>at sunrise, even when it
hurts like hell.</i>

12
00:00:27,433 --> 00:00:29,569
Try not to put a clock on all this.

13
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:32,304
Guess I didn't think
it would go so slow.

14
00:00:37,743 --> 00:00:39,411
Hey, you know a joke?

15
00:00:39,444 --> 00:00:41,279
If there were guys on my team,

16
00:00:41,313 --> 00:00:43,182
I would have tapped out by now.

17
00:00:43,215 --> 00:00:45,418
It's not a competition.

18
00:00:47,386 --> 00:00:48,821
You been keeping up with your P.T

19
00:00:48,853 --> 00:00:50,689
between these assessments?

20
00:00:50,722 --> 00:00:52,859
Yeah. Twice a day.

21
00:00:52,892 --> 00:00:54,694
Three times, when I can.

22
00:00:54,727 --> 00:00:56,395
Twice is enough.

23
00:00:56,428 --> 00:00:59,532
Am I improving? Close?

24
00:00:59,565 --> 00:01:01,467
I have a few more tests
to put you through.

25
00:01:01,499 --> 00:01:04,871
Mind raising your arms
over your head, please?

26
00:01:04,904 --> 00:01:08,541
Right. Sure.

27
00:01:08,574 --> 00:01:11,144
What time is it?

28
00:01:11,177 --> 00:01:12,345
<i>Twelve past 7:00.</i>

29
00:01:12,377 --> 00:01:14,846
Okay.

30
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,117
Hey! Don't you dare leave without me!

31
00:01:19,517 --> 00:01:21,320
I'm not going anywhere.

32
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:27,459
Okay.

33
00:01:27,492 --> 00:01:29,327
- Hey, stop it.
- What?

34
00:01:29,361 --> 00:01:31,397
- You're gonna slow me down.
- No, we got time.

35
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,567
I've got this morning drive
down to a science.

36
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,670
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah.

37
00:01:51,483 --> 00:01:53,186
- Morning, chief.
- Morning.

38
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:56,189
Hey. How was your assessment?

39
00:01:56,222 --> 00:01:57,557
Doc was hard to read.

40
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,326
They said they'd call me
with the determination.

41
00:02:02,695 --> 00:02:04,297
I don't know, I feel like every time

42
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:06,798
I make progress,
they move the goalposts.

43
00:02:06,832 --> 00:02:08,901
It's a process, Otis.

44
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:10,402
Don't give up.

45
00:02:11,537 --> 00:02:12,772
Right.

46
00:02:16,976 --> 00:02:19,912
<i>Engine 51, Truck 81, Squad 3.</i>

47
00:02:27,286 --> 00:02:30,289
What's this about?

48
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:32,724
I doubt they're doing traffic control.

49
00:02:37,996 --> 00:02:39,599
Okay, let's get a line inside.

50
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:41,299
- Morning, Chief.
- Morning.

51
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:42,568
- What am I looking at?
- Piece of Mexican

52
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:44,470
Cartel property. Rapidly oxidating.

53
00:02:44,502 --> 00:02:45,870
Police raid spark the fire?

54
00:02:45,904 --> 00:02:47,373
Negative, uh... electrical.

55
00:02:47,405 --> 00:02:48,673
Some heavy equipment overheated.

56
00:02:48,707 --> 00:02:50,476
Happy accident. Saved us a warrant.

57
00:02:50,508 --> 00:02:52,445
Okay, I'm gonna need you
to keep your men clear.

58
00:02:52,477 --> 00:02:54,012
Until the blaze is out, I'm in command.

59
00:02:54,046 --> 00:02:55,381
Understood. Just remember,

60
00:02:55,413 --> 00:02:56,749
every scrap of evidence in there

61
00:02:56,781 --> 00:02:57,850
needs to be accounted for.

62
00:02:57,882 --> 00:02:58,984
Still an active crime scene.

63
00:02:59,018 --> 00:03:00,319
We'll do what we can.

64
00:03:00,351 --> 00:03:02,554
- Casey, you copy?
- Got it, Chief.

65
00:03:02,588 --> 00:03:04,224
Let's go.

66
00:03:13,364 --> 00:03:15,667
This place is a drug bank.

67
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:17,936
Kidd, Cordova, check the back halls.

68
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,005
Herrmann and Mouch with me.

69
00:03:19,037 --> 00:03:22,308
- Copy.
- Copy that.

70
00:03:25,077 --> 00:03:27,480
Fire department! Call out!

71
00:03:27,512 --> 00:03:30,048
Fire department! Call out!

72
00:03:30,082 --> 00:03:31,650
Fire department, call out!

73
00:03:31,684 --> 00:03:32,984
Cordova?

74
00:03:33,018 --> 00:03:35,354
Call out, I'm not seeing you!

75
00:03:35,387 --> 00:03:37,023
God, the smoke!

76
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:38,423
Help!

77
00:03:38,457 --> 00:03:40,660
Hey! Hey, I hear you!

78
00:03:40,692 --> 00:03:42,594
I'm right here!

79
00:03:42,627 --> 00:03:44,529
I need you to unlock the door!

80
00:03:44,563 --> 00:03:46,364
I can't!

81
00:03:46,398 --> 00:03:49,401
It's the vault!

82
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:52,971
Cordova, where the hell are you?

83
00:03:53,236 --> 00:03:57,353

Please!

85
00:04:01,046 --> 00:04:03,416
Captain, Chief! I need assistance!

86
00:04:03,448 --> 00:04:05,785
<i>I got a victim stuck behind
a secure door.</i>

87
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,046
It's a two-person job!

88
00:04:07,085 --> 00:04:08,921
But... I lost Cordova!

89
00:04:08,953 --> 00:04:09,954
Copy.

90
00:04:09,988 --> 00:04:11,324
Severide!

91
00:04:11,357 --> 00:04:12,792
- You get that?
- Yeah, Capp.

92
00:04:12,825 --> 00:04:15,661
Come with me, bring your sledge.

93
00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:19,364
Cordova! Where the hell were you?

94
00:04:19,398 --> 00:04:20,799
Sorry, Captain.

95
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,400
- Thought I saw something...
- Explain it later.

96
00:04:22,434 --> 00:04:23,569
Back up squad.

97
00:04:23,602 --> 00:04:26,371
Yes, sir.

98
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:29,975
- Call out!
- Stella!

99
00:04:30,008 --> 00:04:31,911
Hurry! I think we're losing her!

100
00:04:31,944 --> 00:04:33,412
I'm set!

101
00:04:33,444 --> 00:04:35,714
Capp, let's bust out the bottom corner!

102
00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:41,087
Go!

103
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:42,588
- Ready?
- Yep.

104
00:04:42,621 --> 00:04:44,691
Go!

105
00:04:53,866 --> 00:04:56,502
Hey! Stella, what are you doing?

106
00:04:57,102 --> 00:04:58,871
Tell me you wouldn't do the same!

107
00:05:10,782 --> 00:05:13,085
Stella?

108
00:05:13,117 --> 00:05:15,588
Stella!

109
00:05:15,621 --> 00:05:16,989
Help her out!

110
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:18,523
Come on, we got you.

111
00:05:22,194 --> 00:05:23,996
Capp! Take her!

112
00:05:27,165 --> 00:05:29,067
Hey! Here!

113
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,737
I got you!

114
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,738
Breathe! Come on!

115
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,540
Come on!

116
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:39,144
Still breathing, but she's weak.

117
00:05:39,177 --> 00:05:41,680
Right over here, guys.

118
00:05:43,614 --> 00:05:45,785
Can you hear me? What's your name?

119
00:05:45,818 --> 00:05:46,853
Marlena.

120
00:05:46,886 --> 00:05:49,155
I'm not supposed to be here.
They forced me to work.

121
00:05:49,187 --> 00:05:50,555
You don't have to explain anything.

122
00:05:50,588 --> 00:05:51,790
We're gonna take good care of you.

123
00:05:51,823 --> 00:05:53,658
Breathing's stable. No need to intubate.

124
00:05:53,691 --> 00:05:55,660
Good, let's get her loaded up.

125
00:05:58,496 --> 00:05:59,898
Hey, Casey.

126
00:05:59,932 --> 00:06:01,633
Excellent work today.

127
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:03,536
Narcotics commander asked me to express

128
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:06,539
his personal appreciation for our help.

129
00:06:06,571 --> 00:06:08,040
Glad to be of service.

130
00:06:08,073 --> 00:06:10,075
Hey, Cordova.

131
00:06:10,107 --> 00:06:11,509
Check our O2 stocks.

132
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:13,011
Curious to know how much we used.

133
00:06:13,045 --> 00:06:15,114
Got it, Captain.

134
00:06:15,146 --> 00:06:17,081
So, uh...

135
00:06:17,114 --> 00:06:18,817
How's it been working out?

136
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:24,222
Rocky start, but things improved.

137
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:26,058
Did more freelancing on this last call

138
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,048
than I would have liked, but...

139
00:06:28,227 --> 00:06:30,696
nothing worse than
Severide or I have done.

140
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,732
How well do you think he'll fit in,

141
00:06:33,765 --> 00:06:35,935
if his detail becomes more permanent?

142
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:41,140
- Chief, Otis is...
- I know, Casey.

143
00:06:41,172 --> 00:06:43,542
I'm just asking.

144
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:44,742
I mean, Lord knows we'd all

145
00:06:44,775 --> 00:06:47,522
crawl through hell for Otis, but...

146
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:49,748
we have to be clear-eyed.

147
00:06:51,516 --> 00:06:52,984
Understood, Chief.

148
00:06:59,992 --> 00:07:02,071
<i>Who is at the scene of
the fire that occurred</i>

149
00:07:02,096 --> 00:07:03,493
<i>earlier this morning. Sources say...</i>

150
00:07:03,518 --> 00:07:04,630
Gotta be a hit to the whole

151
00:07:04,662 --> 00:07:06,665
neighborhood drug market, right?

152
00:07:06,698 --> 00:07:07,833
I'm sure it'll be

153
00:07:07,866 --> 00:07:09,702
back to business as usual by Monday.

154
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:12,504
Hey, shows how knuckleheaded
these criminals are.

155
00:07:12,537 --> 00:07:14,607
They put all their eggs in one basket.

156
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,642
They lose everything.

157
00:07:16,674 --> 00:07:18,143
Should have diversified.

158
00:07:18,175 --> 00:07:20,045
<i>That's</i> their problem.

159
00:07:20,078 --> 00:07:22,881
They need you managing
their portfolio, Herrmann!

160
00:07:22,915 --> 00:07:25,083
It's basic money management, all right?

161
00:07:25,117 --> 00:07:27,119
It's the perfect story
to use for Lee Henry.

162
00:07:27,152 --> 00:07:29,255
We're trying to
show him the value of money...

163
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:31,055
I'm sorry, Herrmann, did you just say...

164
00:07:31,088 --> 00:07:32,857
Mm... not worth it.

165
00:07:32,891 --> 00:07:35,593
Hey, let me give you an example, okay?

166
00:07:35,626 --> 00:07:37,795
Uh... Lee Henry, he comes up to me

167
00:07:37,828 --> 00:07:40,865
and he asks me if he can
move into the apartment

168
00:07:40,898 --> 00:07:42,300
over the garage.

169
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,035
Guess what I told him?

170
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:47,138
That he's too young,
that that's a terrible idea.

171
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:50,042
No, I told him...

172
00:07:52,109 --> 00:07:54,646
Make me an offer.

173
00:07:55,746 --> 00:07:58,617
Yeah. Life lessons.

174
00:08:01,218 --> 00:08:03,088
There you are!

175
00:08:04,823 --> 00:08:06,325
I thought you were on a run.

176
00:08:06,357 --> 00:08:07,660
Nah.

177
00:08:07,693 --> 00:08:10,629
Just staying in the air for a minute.

178
00:08:10,662 --> 00:08:12,031
How's life with Severide?

179
00:08:12,064 --> 00:08:14,799
Saw the two of you stumble in
at the last minute today.

180
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,136
I won't lie.

181
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,039
It is...

182
00:08:20,071 --> 00:08:21,573
It is hot.

183
00:08:21,607 --> 00:08:23,275
Well, that sounds like fun.

184
00:08:25,076 --> 00:08:27,245
Yeah, his, uh... his mom said something

185
00:08:27,278 --> 00:08:28,780
when she was in town, though.

186
00:08:28,814 --> 00:08:30,849
She brought up how Kelly...

187
00:08:30,881 --> 00:08:34,119
can be fickle like his dad
when it comes to relationships.

188
00:08:34,152 --> 00:08:35,921
I don't know, I think
Severide has moved past

189
00:08:35,953 --> 00:08:38,590
his wild life. We've all seen it.

190
00:08:38,623 --> 00:08:40,658
True. Even in the time I've known him,

191
00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:43,996
he's come a long way
from his wedding in Vegas days.

192
00:08:46,365 --> 00:08:48,801
What wedding in Vegas?

193
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:52,804
Oh, I just... I just meant, uh...

194
00:08:54,372 --> 00:08:56,874
Brett?

195
00:08:56,908 --> 00:08:58,310
Don't look at me, girl.

196
00:08:58,343 --> 00:09:00,179
What wedding in Vegas?

197
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,948
<i>Ambo 61...</i>

198
00:09:02,981 --> 00:09:04,283
To be continued.

199
00:09:04,315 --> 00:09:07,218
Oh, it better be.

200
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,368
You can stand down.

201
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,303
- What happened?
- Gang hit.

202
00:09:24,336 --> 00:09:26,205
Five victims killed execution style.

203
00:09:26,237 --> 00:09:27,739
- No survivors.
- Angel!

204
00:09:27,772 --> 00:09:30,375
Please! My husband!

205
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:31,677
My husband! Please!

206
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:33,845
Hey, Dawson?

207
00:09:36,448 --> 00:09:39,833
"Ladron." What's that mean?

208
00:09:40,151 --> 00:09:41,819
Thief.

209
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,185
There's a lot of activity
from the cartel since the fire.

210
00:09:49,248 --> 00:09:51,248
Rumor is, they had
more cash in that building

211
00:09:51,295 --> 00:09:52,607
than the news reported.

212
00:09:52,632 --> 00:09:53,717
Got shot-callers wondering

213
00:09:53,742 --> 00:09:55,034
what happened with the rest.

214
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:56,937
They're convinced $100,000 was stolen.

215
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,202
Amazing. They lost millions to the cops

216
00:09:59,235 --> 00:10:01,071
but they're gonna
mow down the neighborhood

217
00:10:01,103 --> 00:10:02,271
over 100 grand?

218
00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:03,552
It's a power thing.

219
00:10:03,577 --> 00:10:05,011
Gives them the chance to draw blood.

220
00:10:05,036 --> 00:10:06,427
Reassert their position.

221
00:10:06,443 --> 00:10:07,711
They're gonna go scorched earth until

222
00:10:07,745 --> 00:10:09,547
they find the thief
and reclaim the money.

223
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,516
What if the cartel don't
find the person responsible?

224
00:10:11,548 --> 00:10:14,384
That sounds like a long shot.

225
00:10:14,418 --> 00:10:16,888
Then we're in for a bloody month.

226
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:20,225
I'd do what you can to be prepared.

227
00:10:20,258 --> 00:10:21,926
I'll brief the incoming platoon.

228
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,728
We'll deal with each step as it comes.

229
00:10:24,761 --> 00:10:26,397
Okay?

230
00:10:31,302 --> 00:10:32,604
Doesn't feel right, leaving shift

231
00:10:32,636 --> 00:10:33,971
with so much up in the air.

232
00:10:34,004 --> 00:10:36,240
Maybe there's something
we can do to help.

233
00:10:36,274 --> 00:10:37,976
Marlena? The woman we saved?

234
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:39,443
If this really is an inside job,

235
00:10:39,476 --> 00:10:42,012
maybe she knows something
or saw something.

236
00:10:42,046 --> 00:10:43,815
Or was involved.

237
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:45,817
I mean, if there's
any information she has

238
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,719
worth passing along to the police...

239
00:10:47,751 --> 00:10:49,653
It's worth having a conversation.

240
00:10:51,922 --> 00:10:54,359
What?

241
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:55,894
You've got that look in your eye.

242
00:11:01,065 --> 00:11:02,867
I just feel like...

243
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:04,568
Hey! It's not up for debate!

244
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:08,372
I like my coffee from
a pot, not a pellet.

245
00:11:08,405 --> 00:11:12,577
Fine. I'll drop it. For now.

246
00:11:24,788 --> 00:11:26,490
I have a question for you.

247
00:11:26,524 --> 00:11:28,827
What?

248
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,964
Were you ever married before?

249
00:11:36,701 --> 00:11:38,637
Who told you about that?

250
00:11:40,538 --> 00:11:42,573
So I guess that's a yes?

251
00:11:45,576 --> 00:11:47,711
It was a crazy time.

252
00:11:50,548 --> 00:11:52,950
When we first met,
I'd just lost my best friend

253
00:11:52,982 --> 00:11:56,620
and she had just lost her sister.

254
00:11:56,653 --> 00:11:59,456
Did you love her?

255
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,893
At the time. Maybe.

256
00:12:05,696 --> 00:12:09,466
Well, it would have been
good to hear about it.

257
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,937
Sorry.

258
00:12:14,804 --> 00:12:18,909
Are there any other surprises
that I should know about?

259
00:12:18,942 --> 00:12:21,879
Other ex-wives you haven't mentioned?

260
00:12:25,383 --> 00:12:27,485
Fiancées count?

261
00:12:27,518 --> 00:12:30,388
Seriously?

262
00:12:30,421 --> 00:12:33,358
I'm just putting it all out there.

263
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,459
I was young.

264
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:36,861
But you're smarter now.

265
00:12:36,894 --> 00:12:40,597
You... you've got yourself
figured out, right?

266
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,936
I'm working on it.

267
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,619
You brought me to the hospital.

268
00:13:01,652 --> 00:13:04,155
I did, yeah. How you feeling?

269
00:13:04,187 --> 00:13:06,624
I'm okay.

270
00:13:06,657 --> 00:13:09,793
Just came to talk to you.
If that's okay.

271
00:13:09,827 --> 00:13:11,629
I don't know anything about the drugs.

272
00:13:11,662 --> 00:13:13,663
I swear, I-I just pack the money.

273
00:13:13,697 --> 00:13:15,500
Oh, no, I'm... I'm not with the police.

274
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:17,634
I'm not trying to get you in trouble.

275
00:13:17,668 --> 00:13:19,803
Actually, um...

276
00:13:21,071 --> 00:13:23,807
I need your help.

277
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,443
Marlena, do you know
anything about money

278
00:13:26,476 --> 00:13:27,911
being stolen from that house?

279
00:13:27,945 --> 00:13:30,415
Why? Do the police think I stole...

280
00:13:30,447 --> 00:13:33,583
No. No, they don't.

281
00:13:33,616 --> 00:13:36,053
But the cartel believes someone did.

282
00:13:37,187 --> 00:13:39,790
And right now, they're on a hunt.

283
00:13:39,823 --> 00:13:41,925
People are dying,
so if you know anything,

284
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:45,095
anything at all, you can stop it.

285
00:13:46,963 --> 00:13:49,967
Do you know what they do
to people who talk?

286
00:13:50,801 --> 00:13:52,937
Their families?

287
00:13:54,205 --> 00:13:56,107
Not just killing.

288
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,009
They'll cut off your head.

289
00:13:59,043 --> 00:14:00,945
Your limbs.

290
00:14:04,514 --> 00:14:06,650
I've seen more than you might think.

291
00:14:07,851 --> 00:14:10,855
That's why I'm here.
I'm trying to save lives.

292
00:14:25,903 --> 00:14:27,672
Okay.

293
00:14:30,106 --> 00:14:32,910
Someone tried to kill me.

294
00:14:35,011 --> 00:14:37,647
It was dark.

295
00:14:37,681 --> 00:14:40,718
There was so much smoke.

296
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,487
But I saw him.

297
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,189
He was holding something.

298
00:14:46,222 --> 00:14:48,892
Did you recognize him?

299
00:14:48,926 --> 00:14:51,729
He was just a shape.

300
00:14:51,761 --> 00:14:54,798
A dark outline.

301
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:55,732
Big.

302
00:14:55,765 --> 00:14:59,536
More than six foot tall.

303
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,273
Heavy coat.

304
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:04,209
When he saw me looking...

305
00:15:04,841 --> 00:15:06,991
he rushed me.

306
00:15:08,111 --> 00:15:10,747
Pushed me into that cage and shut it.

307
00:15:13,317 --> 00:15:15,653
It happened so fast, I...

308
00:15:15,686 --> 00:15:18,189
I thought I was dead.

309
00:15:22,091 --> 00:15:25,028
It's okay.

310
00:15:25,062 --> 00:15:28,265
We're doing everything we can
to find him, I promise.

311
00:15:37,307 --> 00:15:38,842
Hey. Gabby went to the hospital

312
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,778
to check on a victim.
She'll be back soon.

313
00:15:40,811 --> 00:15:42,213
I actually came to talk to you.

314
00:15:42,245 --> 00:15:44,180
I hear the cartel's still out for blood.

315
00:15:44,213 --> 00:15:46,783
Yeah, they dropped
three guys at a discount mall.

316
00:15:46,817 --> 00:15:48,885
Broad daylight, families shopping.

317
00:15:48,918 --> 00:15:50,321
It's a miracle no one else got hurt.

318
00:15:50,354 --> 00:15:51,756
How can I help?

319
00:15:51,788 --> 00:15:52,990
I went over your incident report.

320
00:15:53,023 --> 00:15:55,192
I just wanted to make sure
I understood it.

321
00:15:55,225 --> 00:15:56,860
Where was the fire, where was your team?

322
00:15:56,894 --> 00:15:59,029
Fire was toward the rear of the house.

323
00:15:59,062 --> 00:16:00,798
It spread through the walls and ceiling.

324
00:16:00,831 --> 00:16:02,099
Herrman, Mouch, and I searched the front

325
00:16:02,131 --> 00:16:03,934
where the counting machines were.

326
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:05,735
And you found one victim?

327
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:07,038
Guy in the bathroom.

328
00:16:07,071 --> 00:16:09,606
He have a bag on him?
Coat with deep pockets?

329
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,774
Places to hide cash?

330
00:16:10,807 --> 00:16:12,342
Nope. We would have caught it.

331
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,977
What about the others?

332
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,812
Kidd found a victim
trapped in a secure room.

333
00:16:15,837 --> 00:16:19,207
Right here. Again, no cash on her.

334
00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:21,729
What about Cordova?
He find anyone on his search?

335
00:16:21,754 --> 00:16:24,062
No, he and Kidd got separated early on.

336
00:16:24,087 --> 00:16:25,307
Must have lost track somewhere.

337
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:26,756
While they were headed toward the back,

338
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:27,818
in the direction of the flames.

339
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:29,302
Yeah. A few minutes later,

340
00:16:29,327 --> 00:16:31,763
I saw him come out a rear door.

341
00:16:31,965 --> 00:16:33,566
This one?

342
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:34,959
Must be.

343
00:16:36,536 --> 00:16:37,871
What?

344
00:16:37,903 --> 00:16:39,572
Nothing.

345
00:16:39,605 --> 00:16:41,807
Antonio, please.

346
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,510
I'm responsible.
If... if it concerns my unit,

347
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,013
I need to know.

348
00:16:50,148 --> 00:16:53,253
Hey, the basement is looking great.

349
00:16:53,286 --> 00:16:54,854
Lee Henry did a hell of a job.

350
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,889
Yeah, what'd I tell you?
The boy's got hustle

351
00:16:56,922 --> 00:16:58,892
now that he has an apartment to pay for.

352
00:16:58,925 --> 00:17:00,594
Yeah, don't you think
he's a little young

353
00:17:00,627 --> 00:17:02,128
to be working as a bar-back, though?

354
00:17:02,161 --> 00:17:03,729
No, a job's a job.

355
00:17:03,763 --> 00:17:05,998
Besides, he's a model employee.

356
00:17:06,032 --> 00:17:08,935
Always on time,
never have to remind him.

357
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:12,605
Yeah, but that doesn't
strike you as suspicious?

358
00:17:12,638 --> 00:17:14,741
- Why would it?
- I don't know.

359
00:17:14,773 --> 00:17:17,643
At his age, only time
I was on my best behavior

360
00:17:17,676 --> 00:17:19,279
was when I was up to no good.

361
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:22,882
So, uh, I don't know,
you may wanna just...

362
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:26,720
recheck the vodka bottles,
make sure they're still vodka.

363
00:17:36,728 --> 00:17:38,197
You okay?

364
00:17:39,999 --> 00:17:42,102
Just heard back from HQ.

365
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:45,805
Doc says I'm worse than I was last time.

366
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:47,741
How's that even possible?

367
00:17:47,773 --> 00:17:48,841
She says I'm over-training.

368
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,944
I'm pushing myself too hard.

369
00:17:50,976 --> 00:17:52,978
Oh...

370
00:17:53,012 --> 00:17:57,117
Anyway... I scheduled another
assessment in a couple days.

371
00:17:57,149 --> 00:17:59,252
That fast?

372
00:17:59,284 --> 00:18:01,554
Yeah, well, clock's ticking.

373
00:18:01,588 --> 00:18:02,856
If I don't get back on 81 soon,

374
00:18:02,888 --> 00:18:04,157
I might not get back at all.

375
00:18:04,189 --> 00:18:06,659
Okay, but she told you
not to over-train.

376
00:18:06,693 --> 00:18:08,728
Eh... Short-term problem.

377
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:10,096
Otis, we all want you back on truck,

378
00:18:10,128 --> 00:18:11,731
but it's not worth risking
your entire career

379
00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:13,966
to rush it, right?

380
00:18:18,137 --> 00:18:19,606
Hey.

381
00:18:19,638 --> 00:18:21,808
We need to talk.

382
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,078
All right.

383
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,146
What's up?

384
00:18:26,178 --> 00:18:27,580
Is there anything I need to know

385
00:18:27,613 --> 00:18:30,282
about yesterday's call?

386
00:18:30,315 --> 00:18:31,684
What do you mean?

387
00:18:31,717 --> 00:18:34,153
The back room had a stack of cash,

388
00:18:34,186 --> 00:18:36,156
sorted into sequentially marked bundles.

389
00:18:36,188 --> 00:18:38,757
Police say three
of those bundles are missing.

390
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,694
Presumed stolen.

391
00:18:40,726 --> 00:18:42,963
Right.

392
00:18:42,995 --> 00:18:45,031
So I must have stolen it.

393
00:18:45,063 --> 00:18:46,065
You were the only firefighter

394
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:47,333
to set foot in that room.

395
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:48,969
You got some nerve, Casey.

396
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,671
Did you take the cash?

397
00:18:51,704 --> 00:18:53,940
Because if you did, now's
the time to say something.

398
00:18:53,973 --> 00:18:55,241
Oh, so you're just trying
to look out for me.

399
00:18:55,273 --> 00:18:56,775
I'm just offering you a chance to...

400
00:18:56,809 --> 00:18:58,311
Come on, be straight.

401
00:18:58,343 --> 00:18:59,345
You want me out of your house

402
00:18:59,378 --> 00:19:01,781
and away from your wife.

403
00:19:01,813 --> 00:19:02,983
And you're willing to drag my ass

404
00:19:03,015 --> 00:19:04,717
through the mud to do it.

405
00:19:04,751 --> 00:19:07,788
If I were you, I'd think
before I said another word.

406
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,631
Call IED if you wanna file a charge.

407
00:19:17,664 --> 00:19:20,367
But I'm not listening to this.

408
00:19:25,103 --> 00:19:27,407
I never accused Cordova.
I just asked him a question.

409
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:29,942
With some serious
implications, don't you think?

410
00:19:29,975 --> 00:19:31,276
Put yourself in his shoes.

411
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,946
If I were in his shoes,
I never would have been

412
00:19:32,978 --> 00:19:34,313
in that part of the
building to begin with.

413
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:36,049
Oh, so you've never
broken reg on a call?

414
00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:37,684
Not without a damn good explanation.

415
00:19:37,716 --> 00:19:39,785
Well, maybe you're asking
the wrong question.

416
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:43,322
Marlena said that she saw
another person in the fire.

417
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:45,090
Said that he...
he locked her in the room

418
00:19:45,124 --> 00:19:46,660
when she saw him pocketing cash.

419
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:48,261
There were no other victims.

420
00:19:48,293 --> 00:19:51,130
I'm just telling you what she saw, okay?

421
00:19:51,164 --> 00:19:53,767
She spotted a tall figure
with a heavy coat

422
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,034
who forced her into the room.

423
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:59,105
A tall figure... what, about 6'3?

424
00:19:59,138 --> 00:20:01,840
Gabby, don't take this the wrong way.

425
00:20:01,874 --> 00:20:03,243
But it's possible you're
letting your history with

426
00:20:03,275 --> 00:20:06,178
Cordova affect your ability to
see this objectively.

427
00:20:06,212 --> 00:20:08,815
Or you are.

428
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:21,742
Christopher?

429
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:23,023
Hey, hon!

430
00:20:23,093 --> 00:20:24,518
I was wondering if I could

431
00:20:24,543 --> 00:20:25,940
speak with you for a moment?

432
00:20:25,956 --> 00:20:27,390
You mind if I
get a couple of bites first?

433
00:20:27,424 --> 00:20:29,788
'Cause those bells can
go off any minute.

434
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,525
It's about Lee Henry.

435
00:20:31,551 --> 00:20:33,764
Okay. Is everything all right?

436
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:35,155
Did he get hurt?

437
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:40,127
No. He's not hurt.

438
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,528
It concerns your experiment.

439
00:20:42,561 --> 00:20:44,798
You know, if you want we could...

440
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:47,801
No, no. Well, what is it?

441
00:20:49,702 --> 00:20:51,838
You can talk in front of
the guys; we're all family.

442
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,206
Eh, you know, we'll just...

443
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,642
Fine.

444
00:20:55,675 --> 00:20:57,543
I just walked in on your son

445
00:20:57,577 --> 00:20:59,279
watching pornography in his apartment.

446
00:20:59,311 --> 00:21:00,479
Yeah, we're gonna...

447
00:21:00,512 --> 00:21:02,282
Yep.

448
00:21:02,314 --> 00:21:05,684
Um...

449
00:21:10,189 --> 00:21:12,758
Thought Herrmann was doing
the equipment check today.

450
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:16,163
Uh, he was, but, uh...

451
00:21:16,195 --> 00:21:18,298
We switched 'cause I just wanted

452
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,300
some time to myself.

453
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,435
Everything okay?

454
00:21:22,467 --> 00:21:24,570
Yeah.

455
00:21:24,603 --> 00:21:27,573
Just, uh...

456
00:21:27,607 --> 00:21:29,343
Dumb stuff.

457
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:37,850
Did you know that Severide
used to be married?

458
00:21:37,884 --> 00:21:40,187
For what it's worth...

459
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,690
She wasn't exactly the love of his life.

460
00:21:43,723 --> 00:21:45,258
I wouldn't worry.

461
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,860
I'm not worried, I...

462
00:21:47,894 --> 00:21:50,864
I just hear stories like that,
and it freaks me out,

463
00:21:50,897 --> 00:21:54,301
because every time
I think I know the guy...

464
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,869
I discover that
he's holding something back.

465
00:21:58,905 --> 00:22:00,840
Yup...

466
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,677
I understand that feeling entirely.

467
00:22:06,478 --> 00:22:08,747
I could see that.

468
00:22:08,781 --> 00:22:11,284
How do you manage?

469
00:22:12,784 --> 00:22:15,354
By being patient when I can.

470
00:22:15,387 --> 00:22:17,657
Honest when I have to be.

471
00:22:17,689 --> 00:22:20,393
It's not always easy.

472
00:22:21,394 --> 00:22:23,797
Gabby and Kelly both
have these little corners

473
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,366
of themselves where
no one else is allowed.

474
00:22:26,398 --> 00:22:28,401
Not even us.

475
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:33,772
Can't change them, but...

476
00:22:33,805 --> 00:22:36,609
You set your own standards.

477
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:41,714
Cordova's here, and the Chief's ready.

478
00:22:41,747 --> 00:22:43,349
Thanks.

479
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,729
You wanted to see me, Chief?

480
00:22:55,762 --> 00:22:58,831
Come on in. Close the door.

481
00:23:02,668 --> 00:23:05,804
- Should I call a union rep?
- That is your right.

482
00:23:05,838 --> 00:23:08,474
However, this is not
an official conversation.

483
00:23:08,507 --> 00:23:10,876
You're under
no obligation to participate.

484
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:12,745
I apologize for coming at you
the other night.

485
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:14,314
I was out of line.

486
00:23:14,347 --> 00:23:16,715
My only interest now is
to get to the truth.

487
00:23:16,749 --> 00:23:19,753
All of this is off the record.

488
00:23:19,785 --> 00:23:21,955
What do you want to know?

489
00:23:24,857 --> 00:23:26,826
At the fire last shift,

490
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:29,829
I asked you to stick with Kidd.

491
00:23:29,861 --> 00:23:31,531
Why didn't you?

492
00:23:32,999 --> 00:23:35,302
You ever see a ghost?

493
00:23:35,335 --> 00:23:38,371
Victim you thought was there,
but really wasn't?

494
00:23:38,404 --> 00:23:40,940
We were crawling the halls;
it was thick with smoke.

495
00:23:40,973 --> 00:23:42,642
Could have sworn on my life,

496
00:23:42,675 --> 00:23:45,311
I saw someone. I mean, I was sure of it.

497
00:23:45,345 --> 00:23:47,347
He moved away from me,
deeper into the fire.

498
00:23:47,379 --> 00:23:49,315
I looked back, he was
only a couple steps away.

499
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:51,818
So I followed him. Thought I could

500
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:54,454
grab him quick, make the save...
and be back in time.

501
00:23:54,486 --> 00:23:55,988
Have a description?

502
00:23:56,022 --> 00:23:58,657
It was impossible to see.

503
00:23:58,691 --> 00:24:00,727
He was about my height.

504
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,729
I didn't catch much more than that.

505
00:24:02,762 --> 00:24:04,830
And you never found any sign of him.

506
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:08,401
Like I said, he was a ghost.

507
00:24:08,434 --> 00:24:10,103
I searched the room.

508
00:24:10,136 --> 00:24:12,806
He was nowhere.

509
00:24:13,805 --> 00:24:15,040
I know.

510
00:24:15,073 --> 00:24:16,642
I should have given Kidd a heads-up.

511
00:24:16,676 --> 00:24:17,810
I should have stuck to my orders...

512
00:24:17,843 --> 00:24:19,912
I got carried away.

513
00:24:19,945 --> 00:24:21,915
I just wanted to show my hustle.

514
00:24:21,947 --> 00:24:24,517
Prove that I was worth keeping around.

515
00:24:25,952 --> 00:24:29,388
I'll admit: I'm guilty of that.

516
00:24:31,823 --> 00:24:34,760
But I'm telling you.

517
00:24:34,793 --> 00:24:36,897
That's all I'm guilty of.

518
00:24:38,598 --> 00:24:40,500
Okay.

519
00:24:40,532 --> 00:24:43,503
Thanks for coming in.

520
00:24:43,535 --> 00:24:45,904
Thanks.

521
00:24:45,937 --> 00:24:47,907
Thanks, Chief.

522
00:24:54,647 --> 00:24:56,383
This ghost of Cordova's,

523
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:58,051
it matches the description given to us

524
00:24:58,083 --> 00:24:59,885
by one of the other victims.

525
00:24:59,918 --> 00:25:01,553
So you're saying it's real.

526
00:25:01,587 --> 00:25:04,022
I'm saying it's possible.

527
00:25:04,055 --> 00:25:06,024
Police were at
every exit of the building.

528
00:25:06,058 --> 00:25:07,926
No other bodies were recovered.

529
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,698
If there was another
man inside of that building,

530
00:25:11,731 --> 00:25:13,133
how'd he get away?

531
00:25:17,602 --> 00:25:19,406
Dawson.

532
00:25:19,438 --> 00:25:20,339
You busy?

533
00:25:21,573 --> 00:25:23,109
Look, I hate to put you
in the middle of this.

534
00:25:23,141 --> 00:25:24,943
- Then don't.
- Please.

535
00:25:24,976 --> 00:25:27,179
I need to find out
if this thing's going to IED,

536
00:25:27,213 --> 00:25:29,682
if my career's in jeopardy
over some nonsense.

537
00:25:29,714 --> 00:25:30,949
- I wouldn't know.
- Right.

538
00:25:30,983 --> 00:25:32,519
But you're married
to the person who would.

539
00:25:32,551 --> 00:25:34,420
All right, please, I'm... I'm asking you

540
00:25:34,454 --> 00:25:35,821
to stand by me and tell
these people who I am.

541
00:25:35,855 --> 00:25:37,022
Jake, you've been here for a month.

542
00:25:37,055 --> 00:25:38,490
I think they know who you are.

543
00:25:38,523 --> 00:25:39,758
- Yeah, but...
- No, no, no, no, no.

544
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:41,060
This needs to be said.

545
00:25:41,092 --> 00:25:42,094
You walked through that door, day one,

546
00:25:42,128 --> 00:25:43,530
gunning for someone's job.

547
00:25:43,562 --> 00:25:44,531
I smoothed that over.

548
00:25:44,563 --> 00:25:45,864
And then, to protect yourself,

549
00:25:45,897 --> 00:25:47,166
you asked me to lie to my husband.

550
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:49,101
- Not lying...
- And then, last week?

551
00:25:49,135 --> 00:25:50,470
What you said about our past

552
00:25:50,503 --> 00:25:51,838
not being nothing?

553
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,839
What am I supposed to do with that?

554
00:25:53,872 --> 00:25:54,974
I'm not saying I don't believe you.

555
00:25:55,006 --> 00:25:57,109
But if Casey doesn't trust you,

556
00:25:57,143 --> 00:25:59,646
that's not all on him.

557
00:26:01,813 --> 00:26:03,215
<i>Truck 81, Ambo 61.</i>

558
00:26:03,249 --> 00:26:06,553
<i>Auto accident, 3300 South Kedzie Avenue.</i>

559
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:20,513
What do we got?

560
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:21,802
Baby stroller hanging over the edge.

561
00:26:21,827 --> 00:26:23,067
You've gotta be kidding me.

562
00:26:23,092 --> 00:26:24,044
It was another gang shooting.

563
00:26:24,069 --> 00:26:25,538
Guy pulled up along-side
the driver and popped him.

564
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,206
Car lost control, went off the road,

565
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,808
busted straight through the guardrail.

566
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,909
Please! Help him!

567
00:26:30,943 --> 00:26:32,045
Don't let him fall!

568
00:26:33,545 --> 00:26:34,913
- Herrmann, I need a rope.
- Yeah.

569
00:26:34,946 --> 00:26:35,948
Right here, Captain.

570
00:26:35,982 --> 00:26:37,149
I'll grab some back-up.

571
00:26:37,183 --> 00:26:38,151
I'll make sure the fence is secure.

572
00:26:38,184 --> 00:26:40,271
- Casey, I can reach...
- Move back.

573
00:26:40,296 --> 00:26:41,664
Keep watch.

574
00:26:41,689 --> 00:26:42,891
Got it.

575
00:26:44,695 --> 00:26:47,194
All right. Good to go.

576
00:26:54,834 --> 00:26:57,236
Come on...

577
00:26:59,897 --> 00:27:01,466
Whoa!

578
00:27:04,908 --> 00:27:07,259
Hang on!

579
00:27:07,767 --> 00:27:10,305
Okay.

580
00:27:16,811 --> 00:27:19,990
Gonna get you out... There we go...

581
00:27:21,282 --> 00:27:23,093
Got him?

582
00:27:23,387 --> 00:27:25,873
I got him!

583
00:27:27,222 --> 00:27:29,586
- Here you go, ma'am.
- Oh, my God!

584
00:27:29,611 --> 00:27:31,689
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

585
00:27:31,714 --> 00:27:34,524
It's okay, baby. Are you okay?

586
00:27:37,426 --> 00:27:40,297
- Great assist.
- Thanks.

587
00:27:51,374 --> 00:27:53,643
You gotta lift it.

588
00:27:53,676 --> 00:27:55,078
That one hasn't been the same

589
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:58,547
since it got shot a little while back.

590
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,318
All right. Copy that.

591
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:03,619
How was the call?

592
00:28:03,653 --> 00:28:05,021
Got hairy for a moment,

593
00:28:05,053 --> 00:28:07,120
but, uh, this team...

594
00:28:07,182 --> 00:28:10,225
You know, I been floating for two years.

595
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:11,961
Worked with some solid smoke-eaters.

596
00:28:11,993 --> 00:28:14,930
I've never seen a crew
this much in sync.

597
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:18,568
I'm glad you get it.

598
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,402
Not everybody does.

599
00:28:25,707 --> 00:28:29,111
Hey, Otis.

600
00:28:29,145 --> 00:28:30,579
I'm rooting for you
on this next assessment,

601
00:28:30,612 --> 00:28:33,215
just so you know.

602
00:28:51,434 --> 00:28:53,002
Something wrong?

603
00:28:53,034 --> 00:28:56,138
No. Not wrong, exactly.

604
00:28:57,406 --> 00:28:59,242
I just want to say, I really appreciate

605
00:28:59,274 --> 00:29:01,243
how supportive everyone's been
these past few weeks.

606
00:29:01,277 --> 00:29:03,413
It's something I'll never forget.

607
00:29:03,445 --> 00:29:04,414
Yeah.

608
00:29:04,446 --> 00:29:05,982
Of course.

609
00:29:06,014 --> 00:29:07,617
There's more though, um...

610
00:29:07,649 --> 00:29:10,419
If there's one thing
I've learned in my years at 51,

611
00:29:10,453 --> 00:29:12,355
it's that the work we do,
it's bigger than

612
00:29:12,387 --> 00:29:13,423
any one person.

613
00:29:13,455 --> 00:29:14,724
Finding someone who really gets

614
00:29:14,756 --> 00:29:16,091
what this house is about...

615
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:18,161
That's a rare thing.

616
00:29:18,194 --> 00:29:20,596
You've got that in Cordova.

617
00:29:20,628 --> 00:29:22,298
You don't know all the facts.

618
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,366
Maybe.

619
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:25,001
But... I really don't want to

620
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:27,002
be the one holding everyone back.

621
00:29:27,035 --> 00:29:28,304
So...

622
00:29:30,005 --> 00:29:31,440
If I don't get my clearance this week,

623
00:29:31,474 --> 00:29:33,141
I plan to step aside.

624
00:29:33,175 --> 00:29:35,345
Let's not jump the gun.

625
00:29:35,377 --> 00:29:38,181
Go to your assessment, get your results.

626
00:29:38,214 --> 00:29:40,149
We'll take it from there.

627
00:29:41,751 --> 00:29:44,186
Thanks for hearing me out.

628
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,956
Yeah.

629
00:29:50,091 --> 00:29:52,361
Hey. Severide.

630
00:29:53,229 --> 00:29:54,530
I'd love another pair of eyes

631
00:29:54,562 --> 00:29:57,032
on this incident report,
if you can spare them.

632
00:29:57,066 --> 00:29:58,601
Yeah. Happy to help.

633
00:29:58,634 --> 00:30:00,437
Thanks.

634
00:30:01,503 --> 00:30:02,738
So, when you're finished

635
00:30:02,772 --> 00:30:05,081
with the bathroom stalls, you
can move on to the bunk room.

636
00:30:05,106 --> 00:30:06,442
- Dad, I just...
- Hey.

637
00:30:06,474 --> 00:30:07,642
No lip, all right?

638
00:30:07,676 --> 00:30:09,212
You decide to put your brain

639
00:30:09,244 --> 00:30:11,546
in the toilet, so be it, all right?

640
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:14,349
Just consider this another one
of life's lessons.

641
00:30:14,383 --> 00:30:16,586
When you got a good thing going,

642
00:30:16,618 --> 00:30:18,754
don't press your luck.

643
00:30:18,788 --> 00:30:19,756
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

644
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:21,391
- Okay.
- Okay.

645
00:30:22,258 --> 00:30:24,627
So what happens to the apartment?

646
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:26,428
Eh, nothing.

647
00:30:26,462 --> 00:30:28,631
Goes back to being a home
for the Christmas decorations

648
00:30:28,664 --> 00:30:31,367
and the last couple of crates
of Vitamin Water.

649
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:34,036
Might want to consider tossing those.

650
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,539
Either that, or I rent the place out.

651
00:30:36,571 --> 00:30:38,241
Turn it into one of those 'I-BnB, '

652
00:30:38,273 --> 00:30:40,208
or 'You-BnB, ' whatever type places.

653
00:30:40,242 --> 00:30:42,244
Title of 'Landlord' would suit you.

654
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:51,220
Hey, Herrmann.

655
00:30:52,154 --> 00:30:54,034
How, uh... How serious are you

656
00:30:54,073 --> 00:30:55,291
about renting that apartment out?

657
00:30:55,323 --> 00:30:57,593
Oh, why? You know somebody
that needs a place?

658
00:30:57,626 --> 00:30:58,627
Sure.

659
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,529
Okay.

660
00:31:00,562 --> 00:31:02,197
It's me.

661
00:31:02,231 --> 00:31:04,166
But, I thought that
you and Severide were...

662
00:31:04,199 --> 00:31:06,635
We are, we are. But I'm...

663
00:31:06,668 --> 00:31:09,137
We moved in together...

664
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:12,507
And we skipped
the dating part, and, um...

665
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:15,244
I'm just starting
to think it was a mistake.

666
00:31:16,811 --> 00:31:18,481
Gotta go with your gut.

667
00:31:18,513 --> 00:31:21,317
If you want it, it's yours.

668
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,620
Thanks, Herrmann.

669
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:32,195
We found something.

670
00:31:32,227 --> 00:31:33,329
It's not a guarantee, but it's

671
00:31:33,361 --> 00:31:35,564
definitely worth a closer look.

672
00:31:36,631 --> 00:31:37,866
Here.

673
00:31:37,899 --> 00:31:39,401
On the right, you got the room

674
00:31:39,435 --> 00:31:40,703
with the stolen cash. On the left,

675
00:31:40,735 --> 00:31:41,771
the adjacent bedroom.

676
00:31:41,803 --> 00:31:43,339
They share a wall.

677
00:31:43,371 --> 00:31:45,608
You see what we see?

678
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,808
Walls don't match.

679
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:48,209
Exactly.

680
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,745
According to this floor plan,

681
00:31:49,778 --> 00:31:50,847
this bookshelf right here?

682
00:31:50,879 --> 00:31:51,848
It should be recessed.

683
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,416
Three, maybe four feet.

684
00:31:53,448 --> 00:31:55,317
Got unaccounted space between the rooms.

685
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,585
Could be a trap area,

686
00:31:56,618 --> 00:31:58,221
place where the cartel would stash

687
00:31:58,253 --> 00:32:00,122
extra loot, guns, whatever,

688
00:32:00,156 --> 00:32:01,656
in case of a raid.

689
00:32:01,689 --> 00:32:03,859
If it's okay with you,
we'd like to take a look.

690
00:32:03,893 --> 00:32:05,562
Find out.

691
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:08,231
Let's go.

692
00:32:23,244 --> 00:32:25,147
How would you feel about coming inside?

693
00:32:25,181 --> 00:32:27,216
Walk us through what you saw.

694
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:29,152
If you think it could help.

695
00:32:29,185 --> 00:32:31,521
- I do.
- All right.

696
00:32:37,926 --> 00:32:39,628
I took the lead as we moved to the back.

697
00:32:39,662 --> 00:32:42,265
Figured I could
estimate the layout, but...

698
00:32:42,298 --> 00:32:43,566
The way they have this place set up

699
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:45,534
got me turned around pretty quick.

700
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:48,838
Where do you think you lost Kidd?

701
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,739
Guessing right about here.

702
00:32:50,772 --> 00:32:52,742
Which means...

703
00:32:52,774 --> 00:32:55,277
That's where I saw him.

704
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,216
How'd you end up in this room?

705
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,852
I followed him in here.

706
00:33:02,885 --> 00:33:04,621
Then he was gone.

707
00:33:07,723 --> 00:33:09,325
Severide.

708
00:33:09,358 --> 00:33:11,594
Yeah, I hear it.

709
00:33:19,968 --> 00:33:22,437
Hey, check this out.

710
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:44,703
Found the missing
cash on the victim's body.

711
00:33:44,728 --> 00:33:46,531
Probably used the fire as an excuse

712
00:33:46,556 --> 00:33:48,231
to make some money disappear.

713
00:33:48,263 --> 00:33:49,698
You say you got a guy
who saw him on the call?

714
00:33:49,732 --> 00:33:51,767
Followed him
into that room and lost him.

715
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,436
He must have ducked into
the trap area to hide

716
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,504
thinking he was safe.

717
00:33:55,537 --> 00:33:56,772
Yeah, real sharp.

718
00:33:56,804 --> 00:33:58,340
So what happens now?

719
00:33:58,374 --> 00:34:00,376
Now we work overtime to put the word out

720
00:34:00,408 --> 00:34:01,743
that the money's been found.

721
00:34:01,777 --> 00:34:03,613
Tamp down on the violence,
shouldn't take long.

722
00:34:03,646 --> 00:34:05,414
Whatever we can do to help, let us know.

723
00:34:05,446 --> 00:34:07,783
Hey, you've done plenty.

724
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:22,330
I'm, uh...

725
00:34:22,364 --> 00:34:24,534
Sorry I doubted you.

726
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:27,936
It's okay.

727
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:30,505
Shouldn't have thrown it
back in your face.

728
00:34:30,538 --> 00:34:31,741
Surprised that wasn't the end of me

729
00:34:31,773 --> 00:34:34,042
right then and there.

730
00:34:34,076 --> 00:34:35,844
On the contrary.

731
00:34:35,878 --> 00:34:39,749
Soon as we get back,
I'm gonna put a call in to HQ.

732
00:34:39,782 --> 00:34:42,785
Let them know that as long as
we've got a seat open...

733
00:34:44,052 --> 00:34:46,822
You're our guy.

734
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:01,336
Hey.

735
00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:03,938
I am ready to hit the road
whenever you are.

736
00:35:03,971 --> 00:35:06,308
Yeah, just give me a minute.

737
00:35:14,717 --> 00:35:18,788
I, uh... I meant to tell you

738
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:21,723
that I spoke with Herrmann about...

739
00:35:21,757 --> 00:35:24,694
moving into his apartment upstairs.

740
00:35:25,661 --> 00:35:27,563
What?

741
00:35:27,596 --> 00:35:29,804
I just don't want to be...

742
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,601
another mistake.

743
00:35:33,134 --> 00:35:35,103
Another story about...

744
00:35:35,218 --> 00:35:36,805
moving too fast

745
00:35:36,882 --> 00:35:38,607
and burning out quick

746
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:40,743
because we have done that once before.

747
00:35:40,775 --> 00:35:42,110
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

748
00:35:42,143 --> 00:35:43,978
Stella, if you're
talking about Brittany...

749
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:45,613
We were married for less than a month.

750
00:35:45,647 --> 00:35:47,750
It was... the easiest annulment ever.

751
00:35:47,782 --> 00:35:49,618
It's like it never even happened.

752
00:35:50,918 --> 00:35:54,357
That's what concerns me.

753
00:36:13,442 --> 00:36:15,578
You have any dry cleaning?

754
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,846
No.

755
00:36:16,878 --> 00:36:18,913
Food should be ready in a minute.

756
00:36:18,947 --> 00:36:21,351
Going as fast as I can.

757
00:36:30,058 --> 00:36:31,159
Hey.

758
00:36:31,192 --> 00:36:33,094
Everything all right?

759
00:36:33,128 --> 00:36:34,597
Yeah.

760
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,862
Sorry to bother you at home. I just...

761
00:36:36,965 --> 00:36:39,034
wanted to swing by
and tell you in person.

762
00:36:39,067 --> 00:36:40,869
As much as I appreciated you

763
00:36:40,902 --> 00:36:43,906
extending my detail on 51...

764
00:36:43,938 --> 00:36:45,974
I think I'm gonna have to pass.

765
00:36:46,007 --> 00:36:47,909
Where's this coming from?

766
00:36:47,942 --> 00:36:49,744
51's a great house.

767
00:36:49,777 --> 00:36:51,913
There's no place
I'd rather be, it's just...

768
00:36:51,947 --> 00:36:53,482
Feels like I've been nothing but trouble

769
00:36:53,514 --> 00:36:54,650
since the day I arrived.

770
00:36:54,683 --> 00:36:55,918
It's all in the past.

771
00:36:55,951 --> 00:36:57,019
I know.

772
00:36:57,052 --> 00:36:58,654
But still.

773
00:36:58,686 --> 00:37:00,188
Sometimes things don't work out the way

774
00:37:00,221 --> 00:37:02,090
you really wish they had.

775
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:05,794
Doesn't help to dwell. Gotta move on.

776
00:37:05,828 --> 00:37:10,065
Like I said, wasn't an easy choice.

777
00:37:10,098 --> 00:37:11,861
Well, I...

778
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:15,137
guess you have to do what feels right.

779
00:37:16,103 --> 00:37:18,940
Just know I'm happy
to put in a good word.

780
00:37:18,973 --> 00:37:21,776
Anywhere you want to go.

781
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,913
Means a lot. Thanks, Cap.

782
00:37:26,815 --> 00:37:28,951
You're a lucky man.

783
00:37:28,983 --> 00:37:32,087
I hope you realize that.

784
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:33,822
I do.

785
00:37:33,855 --> 00:37:36,024
Every single day of my life.

786
00:37:44,732 --> 00:37:46,067
Do you really mean that?

787
00:38:01,183 --> 00:38:03,753
Of course.

788
00:38:12,877 --> 00:38:14,143
_

789
00:38:14,182 --> 00:38:16,369
_

790
00:38:16,408 --> 00:38:17,838
_

791
00:38:19,955 --> 00:38:21,424
_

792
00:38:21,487 --> 00:38:23,641
_

793
00:38:28,643 --> 00:38:31,180
Mr. Zvonecek?

794
00:38:31,647 --> 00:38:33,081
Right here.

795
00:38:33,114 --> 00:38:34,817
Ready?

796
00:38:35,851 --> 00:38:38,154
Yeah. I'm ready.

797
00:39:06,815 --> 00:39:08,083
Hi.

798
00:39:10,752 --> 00:39:12,288
You're really doing this?

799
00:39:13,688 --> 00:39:16,091
I am.

800
00:39:16,857 --> 00:39:19,727
Doesn't change the way I feel about you.

801
00:39:19,761 --> 00:39:21,329
Or us.

802
00:39:21,362 --> 00:39:22,897
In fact, it's the opposite.

803
00:39:22,931 --> 00:39:25,935
I-I don't want things to change.

804
00:39:25,967 --> 00:39:27,703
And that's why I think that this...

805
00:39:27,735 --> 00:39:29,070
Stella.

806
00:39:31,105 --> 00:39:33,275
I don't care where you live.

807
00:39:37,846 --> 00:39:39,949
Wherever you are,

808
00:39:39,982 --> 00:39:42,184
that's where I want to be.

809
00:39:57,694 --> 00:40:02,694

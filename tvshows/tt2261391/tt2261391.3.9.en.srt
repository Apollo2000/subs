1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,960
Let me teach you to cook.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,900
You're, like... like, perfect.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,439
I'll give them a week and then
tell Severide they gotta...

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,100
- I like her.
- What?

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,139
He's happy.

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,439
What do I know?

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,240
Losing my sister...

8
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,979
and experiencing the pain of
that loss,

9
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,420
no one understands what it's
like but you, Kelly.

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,820
A long weekend every now and
then wouldn't phase.

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,259
- Yeah, of course.
- Awful.

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,929
Oh.

13
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,399
You okay?

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,499
Oh, I think I heard
something pop.

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,200
- Hey!
- Hey.

16
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,270
You faker.

17
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,840
Go back to the apartment?
Come on.

18

19
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,789
Why don't you ever
answer your mom's call?

20
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,959
I talk to her plenty.

21
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,199
Hey, I have Thanksgiving off.

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,369
Why don't we go to Florida
and meet her and your dad?

23
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,030
No, I don't want
to go home for Thanksgiving.

24
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,039
You don't?
Well, I just figured...

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,309
I got to meet
the in-laws sooner or later.

26
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,709
I mean,
my parents aren't even there.

27
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,109
They go on this carnival cruise
thing every year

28
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,509
with their friends.

29
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,309
Let's just stay here.

30
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,380
Just you and me.

31
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,189
- Okay.
- Good.

32
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,050
Okay.

33
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,999
Hey.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,099
Before we transform
into candidate and lieutenant,

35
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,170
give your girl a kiss.

36
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,180
Morning, lovebirds.

37
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,090
- Morning.
- Hi.

38
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,099
I love this stuff.

39
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,469
Never had it
before I got to Chicago

40
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,539
- and now I am obsessed.
- Yeah, I...

41
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,039
I actually looked up a bunch
of sriracha recipes.

42
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,040
You can make extra spicy
buffalo wings with it,

43
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,140
and that sounded really good.

44
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,109
And you can use it
to make ice cubes

45
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,110
in margaritas and Bloody Marys.

46
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,619
How cool is that?

47
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,480
Pretty cool. So...

48
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,989
See, this is why I love cooking.

49
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,059
You get creative,
you can go anywhere with it.

50
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,990
Speaking
of going anywhere, how about we,

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,299
uh, grab some drinks
after Zumba tomorrow?

52
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,370
Sure.
We can meet up at Molly's.

53
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,539
Um... I was actually
thinking just...

54
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,240
you and me.

55
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:10,549
A date, uh... I'm
asking you on a date.

56
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:18,529
Cruz, I... Joe, I don't...

57
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,199
You're one of my only
good friends here in Chicago.

58
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,600
Let's not mess that up, okay?

59
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:37,040
Engine 51, truck 81,
squad 3, ambulance 61.

60
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,110
Vehicle accident,
6000 West 18th Street.

61
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,099
I don't know why the safety
shut-off didn't work.

62
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,299
I didn't even know
about the leak

63
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,130
till some drivers
started honking at me.

64
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,169
What are you transporting?

65
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,849
Hydrochloric acid.

66
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,539
I put down some sandbags
to try to contain it, but...

67
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,309
All right,
clear the area, right away.

68
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,370
- Get these people back.
- Let's get back!

69
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,079
We have a hydrochloric acid
spill.

70
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,609
We're gonna need level-two
hazmat response.

71
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,549
Set up a decontamination area.

72
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,049
Fog line, scrub brushes,

73
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,119
- and containment pools.
- Hey guys, suit up.

74
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,799
Gonna have to block off
these sewers with an earth dam.

75
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,489
See what you can dig out from
around those trees, all right?

76
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,019
- All right.
- We need to set up a hot zone

77
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,089
extending to the far sidewalk.

78
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,159
No one goes inside the zone

79
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,630
without SCBA
and protective gear.

80
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,199
Chicago Fire S03E09
"Arrest in Transit"

81
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,200
Sync and corrected by
Gianluca Belfiglio

82
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,109
We have to enlarge
the containment zone.

83
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,579
Dawson, what are you doing?

84
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,209
Check out that dump truck.

85
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,019
Hey! Hey!

86
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,080
Hey hey hey hey!

87
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,790
Casey,
hazmat will be here in five.

88
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,160
Hold on a minute.

89
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,469
Is that Dawson
driving that truck?

90
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,540
Yep, it is.

91
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,460
Almost there!

92
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,399
All right, Chief,
we got the valve closed shut.

93
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,599
It should be good until
the chemical company gets here.

94
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,270
Copy that.

95
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,779
Looks like you guys
have this under control.

96
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,519
Uh, yeah, uh, area is isolated,

97
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,619
we've contained the spill.

98
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,639
We're gonna stay on scene

99
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,650
until the response team
neutralize the acid.

100
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,300
Shouldn't your candidate
be in protective gear?

101
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,649
The driver raised the chute
for me.

102
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,739
He showed me
how to release the sand...

103
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,540
We'll talk at the firehouse.

104
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,649
Hey.

105
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,280
- Hey.
- What brings you here?

106
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,589
Came to dognap this thing.

107
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,189
She's kind of the greatest.

108
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,259
You came for the dog?
Really?

109
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,789
No.
24 hours is a really long time.

110
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,529
- Yeah, tell me about it.
- And you guys

111
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,729
were gone a long time and I
think I've looked at pretty much

112
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,899
every picture and plaque
on these walls.

113
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,730
You guys like
to memorialize everything.

114
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,669
Yeah, firefighters
love to get nostalgic.

115
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,270
I don't think
I saw any pictures of Shay.

116
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,209
Down at the end of the hall.

117
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,879
Will you show me?

118
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,179
Yeah.

119
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,319
Come on.

120
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,880
Was Dawson following orders

121
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,850
when she drove through
the hot zone with no gear on?

122
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,919
- No, sir.
- The other Chief at the scene,

123
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,929
he asked me why you were
going easy on your... candidate.

124
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,560
I know you don't want those kind
of questions raised.

125
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,299
If you are not comfortable
talking to Dawson

126
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,869
about her actions today,
I am more than happy

127
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,239
to have
that conversation with her.

128
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,310
I'll take care of it, Chief.

129
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,610
- Wanted to see me, Chief?
- Yeah, I was notified

130
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,469
this morning that you never

131
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,319
got your final follow-up exam
with your eye injury.

132
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,789
No worries... This baby
blue's working just fine.

133
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,559
Yeah, the department,
they need the paperwork.

134
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,229
Otherwise they're gonna sideline
you, so go see the doctor now

135
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,329
and get it done.

136
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,400
You got it, Chief.

137
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,569
You never talk about her.

138
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,600
You never talk about Kathleen.

139
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,339
I kind of thought
that was the deal.

140
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,640
Yeah, I guess so.

141
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,310
Hey.

142
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,219
I want to show you something
later, if you're up for it.

143
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,819
Sounds mysterious.

144
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,720
I'm in.

145
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,590
I know I should've run
the dump truck by you first,

146
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,390
but you were on the radio
and I had to act fast.

147
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,529
If you can't get my go-ahead,

148
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,399
you don't do it.

149
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,699
You ignored my order.

150
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,730
No one in the hot zone
without protective gear.

151
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,639
Well, I was more on
the perimeter of the hot zone...

152
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,869
Gabby, it's one thing
to go off book

153
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,509
when you're the P.I.C. on ambo,

154
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,279
but you're part of a team now.

155
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,609
Under my command.

156
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,949
Following orders is not up
for debate.

157
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:16,680
I understand.

158
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,950
But I did keep the acid
from spreading.

159
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,759
That was pretty cowboy.
Give me that at least.

160
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,029
That is exactly the kind
of attitude

161
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,760
that could get us
in serious trouble.

162
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,030
Already might have, considering
another battalion chief

163
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,569
was there at the scene,
saw it all go down.

164
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,670
Would you have ignored Boden's
orders like you did mine?

165
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,640
- Matt, come on...
- Gabby.

166
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,949
What you did today crossed
the line

167
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,579
and made fools of both of us,

168
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,949
and if it ever happens again,

169
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,519
I'll be forced
to kick you off truck for good.

170
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,719
Do you understand that?

171
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,790
Yes, sir.

172
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,010
Everything okay?

173
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,919
Yeah... Yeah, yeah.

174
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,019
I was just, uh... thinking about
if I wanted to take a shower.

175
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,389
Can't really make up my mind.

176
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:37,030
Okay... I'll leave
you to it then.

177
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,439
You guys still
using glass eyes these days?

178
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,440
No, last 50 or so years

179
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,509
most artificial eyes are made
out of high-tech plastic.

180
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,710
Can you look up for me?

181
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,979
They look as good
as the glass ones?

182
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,380
Better.

183
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,049
Hard to believe.

184
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,119
That Peter Falk, you know,
Columbo?

185
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,389
Can you look down, please?

186
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:06,529
Sharp-looking guy
and he had a glass eye.

187
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,759
Well, looks like your eye

188
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,529
healed up very nicely,
Mr. McHolland.

189
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,429
- You are good to go.
- Thanks, doc.

190
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,599
As my pops used to say,
I owe you a steak dinner.

191
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,469
I'd love that.
How about Friday night?

192
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,939
I can get the paperwork done,
I'll bring it with.

193
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:23,810
There is that new place
on rush, Leone's?

194
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:30,920
I... Oh, no.

195
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,859
What's wrong, Mouchie?

196
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,059
They didn't clear you for duty?

197
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,479
Guys,
I don't know what happened.

198
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,890
I was just being friendly,
asking about glass eyes...

199
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,129
which is a bona fide interest
of mine...

200
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,969
And all of a sudden...

201
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,830
- I have a date.
- What?

202
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,569
I was simply
expressing gratitude

203
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,509
for how well she fixed me up

204
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,439
and I said, "I owe you a steak
dinner," and then she says,

205
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,609
"Let's go out Friday."

206
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,040
So you asked her out to dinner.

207
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,809
It's an expression!

208
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,629
It is?

209
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,449
- Is she attractive?
- Herrmann, Mouch is spoken for.

210
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,880
You can't blame Mouch for this.

211
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,449
- Yeah, why not?
- 'Cause he's got momentum

212
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,550
on his side.
Nothing succeeds like success.

213
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,459
Oh, so nothing
fails like failure?

214
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,529
- Is that what you're saying?
- What? No, no, I'm just saying,

215
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,689
now that Mouch is a taken man.

216
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,899
He's like catnip to other women.

217
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,399
I'm a taken man,

218
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,899
I ain't got no lady doctors
throwing themselves at me.

219
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,899
Trudy will rip my head clean off

220
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,839
if she finds out I got a date
with another woman.

221
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,900
I got to get out of this.

222
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,870
Joe Cruz.

223
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,879
Talk to me.

224
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,609
About what?

225
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,449
About the rain cloud

226
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:36,519
that's following you around.

227
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,549
I got put in the friend zone.

228
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,690
By who?

229
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,139
You don't know her.

230
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,159
Ambulance 61, injured male,
Cordova High School,

231
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,790
3317 South Garfield.

232
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:55,139
Well, maybe, whoever she is,

233
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,500
she'll turn out
to be a really good friend.

234
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,749
Over here!
Hurry!

235
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,550
Make him breathe, please!

236
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,620
Please, make him breathe!

237
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,049
Jason!

238
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,579
Come on up.
You're all right.

239
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,249
You okay?
You all right, Jason?

240
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,619
It's all right, just sit there,
catch your breath, okay?

241
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,289
- What happened?
- You went into the pool

242
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,120
and then suddenly stopped
moving.

243
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,129
You were, like, floating.

244
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,599
Pressure's good.

245
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,060
Lungs are clear.

246
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,099
How you feeling, Jason?

247
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,169
I'm okay, I guess.

248
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,269
Okay, um... We're gonna get
you up nice and slow, all right?

249
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:08,209
- Right onto the stretcher.
- Okay.

250
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,110
There we go, buddy.

251
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,549
Is he gonna be okay?

252
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,689
That CPR you did saved his live.

253
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,689
I was lifeguard this summer.

254
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:24,320
Alexis... just please don't
tell my father.

255
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,159
Danny already called him.

256
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,659
Dude, we thought you were dead.

257
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,729
Jason!

258
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,899
Sir, he was unconscious
for a few minutes.

259
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,069
Seems to be lucid now.
Breathing fine on his own.

260
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,939
We're gonna take him
to the hospital

261
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,809
where they can do a full exam
on him there.

262
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:39,939
- You okay?
- I'm fine, dad.

263
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,070
- Really.
- What hospital?

264
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,210
Chicago Med.

265
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,049
Your friends didn't waste
any time calling your dad, huh?

266
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,119
They know.

267
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,090
Family is everything to him.

268
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,189
Easy on the talking.

269
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,060
Breathe nice and slow for me.

270
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,760
Hey, i'm hearing rales.

271
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,249
I'm gonna
take his blood pressure,

272
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,730
do what you
can to get us there fast.

273
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,800
Copy that.

274
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,240
I'm not getting
a blood pressure.

275
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,309
We're five away, Mills.

276
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,279
Damn it, secondary drowning!

277
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,879
Call back Chicago Med,

278
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,119
let them know he's going
into respiratory arrest!

279
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,389
Chicago Med,
this is ambulance 61.

280
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,319
Our patient just coded
and went into cardiac arrest.

281
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,189
Our ETA is a minute out.

282
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,359
Copy that, ambulance 61.

283
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,630
We'll prep for your arrival.

284
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,160
He's arresting!

285
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,669
Charging!

286
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,800
Clear!

287
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,179
I'm pushing EPI.

288
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:58,349
Come on, buddy, come on.

289
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,819
Come on, Jason.

290
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,059
Come on, buddy.

291
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,130
Come on, Jason!

292
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,999
Pulmonary edema, he's in
P.E.A., been about six minutes.

293
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,630
He was resuscitated at the scene

294
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,269
but went into arrest in route.
We gave him one EPI.

295
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,900
We've got it.
Three, on my count.

296
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,910
One... two... three.

297
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,379
- Check for a pulse.
- Got nothing.

298
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,810
Continue compressions.

299
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,879
Check respirations.

300
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,849
Got nothing yet.

301
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,249
Stop compressions.

302
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,850
Let's get another EPI in here.

303
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,989
Pushing it.

304
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,859
Come on.

305
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,930
- Is there a pulse?
- No pulse.

306
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,829
- Is there a pulse?
- No pulse.

307
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,300
Still no pulse.

308
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,309
I'm calling it.

309
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,310
Everybody agree?

310
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:56,179
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

311
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,840
11:40.

312
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,290
There was no more you could do.

313
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,900
- What happened?
- Stand back.

314
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,189
Yo, what's going on?

315
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,279
Guess the kid
that got brought in

316
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,879
was Jason Lullo,
"Papa" Lullo's son.

317
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,419
Who is that?

318
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,490
Papers call him the John Gotti
of Chicago.

319
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,790
- Hey.
- Hey.

320
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:53,299
Tomorrow night.
Get a bite to eat with me?

321
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,830
I thought you were working
at Molly's?

322
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,369
Right, you're right.
I am.

323
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,179
I could ask Herrmann
to close out for me.

324
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,379
All right.
Well... let me know.

325
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,350
Yeah, I will...

326
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,889
This is pointless.

327
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,259
We all know she likes me best.
I'm her soul mate.

328
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,799
25 bucks says
she comes to me first.

329
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,899
Okay, ready?

330
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,800
Three... two go!
Pouch!

331
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,519
What happened?

332
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,589
We lost a kid.

333
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,490
Sorry to hear that.

334
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,010
Come here.

335
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,919
The boy's girlfriend was so...

336
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,289
relieved when he was all right.

337
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,559
I told her she saved his life.

338
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,499
I picked up some wings.

339
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,569
Thought we could try out
that recipe?

340
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,599
Happy to help out.

341
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,870
You know I make
a great sous chef.

342
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,880
Do we have butter?

343
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,550
Check.

344
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:01,659
Butter.

345
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,929
You've heard
about the great fire of 1871,

346
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,389
- right?
- Mm-hmm.

347
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,839
They teach you
that in Tallahassee?

348
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,299
Yeah, something about a cow
kicking over a lantern?

349
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,900
Yeah, Mrs. O'leary's cow.

350
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,409
The fire burned for an entire
day and it leveled about three

351
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,639
and a half square miles
of Chicago.

352
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,309
It was like the end
of the world,

353
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,549
and it all took place
right at this spot.

354
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,649
Right here?

355
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,380
Well...

356
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,689
the academy is actually built on
the site of Mrs. O'leary's barn

357
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:30,959
but the cow part... Ahh.

358
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,629
Chicago had to totally rebuild.

359
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:39,229
Now fire's a part of its DNA.

360
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,530
And this is where I learned
all about firefighting.

361
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,679
I learned as much about
protecting people from Shay

362
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,949
as I did from any instructor
at the academy.

363
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,610
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

364
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,289
That's her badge.

365
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,959
Shay was intense.

366
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,229
She'd do anything
to protect the people she loved.

367
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,239
I wish I had known her.

368
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,670
Me too.

369
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,679
Thank you.
For sharing all of this.

370
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,319
You kidding me?

371
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,450
I wouldn't be here at all
if it wasn't for you.

372
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,430
I couldn't even come down here
to see this until now.

373
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,040
I was driving the car.

374
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,649
When my sister
got killed I was...

375
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:05,720
I was driving the car.

376
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,050
Hey.

377
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,669
My parents aren't on a cruise...

378
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:26,740
I just couldn't go home
and face them.

379
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:33,510
- It was an accident.
- I just keep thinking

380
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,649
about seeing the lights
coming at us

381
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,931
and wondering why they were
on the wrong side of the road.

382
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,590
It's not fair.

383
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,599
I walk away with six stitches...

384
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,670
and Kathleen dies.

385
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,700
Hey.

386
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,710
We see this kind
of thing all the time.

387
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,249
One random moment or move

388
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:14,090
and this person lives
or that person dies.

389
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:19,529
You can play
"what if" all you want,

390
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,329
"what if it was two inches
to the left?"

391
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,799
Or "what if it was
a split second later?"

392
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,870
You'll drive
yourself crazy wondering.

393
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,710
Your parents can't blame you
for what happened,

394
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,780
and neither can you.

395
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,140
You!

396
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,579
You son of a bitch!

397
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,109
Hey.
Hey, just... come on, man.

398
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,649
- You killed my son!
- Hey, Mr. Lullo!

399
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,649
- Just hold on!
- My son!

400
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,380
I understand, Mr. Lullo,
that you're upset.

401
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,749
You understand nothing!

402
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,489
I just came from the morgue
identifying my only son!

403
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,729
What can you possibly
understand about that?

404
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,329
You're... You're right.
I cannot comprehend

405
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,729
what you're going through,
but I do know

406
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,199
what your son went through.

407
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,660
I was with him
the entire time, all right?

408
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,630
All I know is he went
into that ambulance alive

409
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,200
and he came out dead
and that's on your ass!

410
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,509
That's...
That's secondary drowning, okay?

411
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,570
A pulmonary edema.

412
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,809
I heard it all from the doctors,

413
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,339
I don't want to hear
your pathetic excuses!

414
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,779
- Hey, hey!
- Mr. Lullo, hey!

415
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,279
Mr. Lullo, you're upset.
Why don't you get back

416
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,579
in the car.
Mr. Lullo, I'm sorry.

417
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,379
I can't let you do this.
I'm sorry, Mr. Lullo.

418
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,619
I tried everything
to save your boy

419
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,689
and I wish
that I could have saved him.

420
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,690
I'm... I'm sorry.

421
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,700
You're dead.

422
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,639
Lullo is the real deal.

423
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,209
You've got to stay on your toes
for a while.

424
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,180
If you want to press charges...

425
00:25:31,181 --> 00:25:33,759
No, no, look,
he's a grieving father.

426
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,999
Who can blame him
for losing his cool?

427
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,229
Mills, this is not the type
of threat that you let go by.

428
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,869
I would really rather just
talk to him, you know,

429
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,639
- wait until he calms down...
- Bad idea.

430
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,900
Mills, I'm not asking you,
I am telling you.

431
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,539
You let Detective Halstead deal
with this.

432
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,240
You stay away from him.

433
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,689
Uh, you never showed up
to Molly's last night.

434
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,559
Oh, I had to go back
to the porter site,

435
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,959
get that balcony finished up.

436
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,899
It was a long day.

437
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,799
I was wiped out.

438
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,330
Totally, yeah.

439
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,400
Sorry I got home
after you crashed.

440
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:22,509
Um...

441
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:27,449
I was hoping we could talk about
what happened last shift.

442
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,919
I'm not sure
that's a great idea.

443
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,419
Well, I don't mean
boss-to-candidate,

444
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,789
I mean fiance-to-fiancee.

445
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:37,660
That was a pretty rough shift.

446
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,929
I messed up... badly...

447
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:49,439
and was told that if I did it
again, I might lose my job.

448
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,909
It would be nice to talk
about that with the guy I love.

449
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:56,839
In theory, I get that.

450
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,409
But it's not like I can change
the way

451
00:26:58,410 --> 00:26:59,779
I feel about your behavior
on shift

452
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,949
just because we're at home.

453
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:06,689
This is tough for both of us.

454
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:10,389
I know it is, but Matt, it's...

455
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,989
If we can't talk about things
when they get tough,

456
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:15,060
how is this ever gonna work?

457
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,340
Guess I'll see you later.

458
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,010
Yeah.

459
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:53,499
Hey... Yeah, I... I'm
sorry about that...

460
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,570
Things have just been
a little crazy here and...

461
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,910
I know... I really
miss you too, mom...

462
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,919
First I had to get
myself appropriately psyched up

463
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,659
for the conversation,
which I did.

464
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,959
Then I called her office

465
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,990
and said,
"May I speak to Dr. Lu?"

466
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,629
Which made me realize,

467
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,599
I don't even
know her first name.

468
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,969
- Cut to the chase, Mouch.
- Right.

469
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:29,669
So she finally gets on the line

470
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:33,469
and I am ready to tell her
"I can't have dinner with you!"

471
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,439
Why do I get the feeling
that never happened?

472
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,579
Chief,
I couldn't get the words out.

473
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,940
She sounded so excited,

474
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,810
I didn't want to send her
on some downward spiral.

475
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:45,149
Apparently, doctors have
a very high rate of depression.

476
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:47,049
Optometrists do?

477
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,950
Oh, I believe
she's an ophthalmologist.

478
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,709
Mouch, you have got to cancel.

479
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,459
Trudy is not the type of woman
who can be trifled with.

480
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,959
I know.
You're right.

481
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,590
Wait, hold on a sec.

482
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,829
Mouch is a grown man.

483
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,499
Trudy's got no right to tell him

484
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,169
who he can and cannot
break bread with.

485
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:01,899
There's a certain amount
of logic to that.

486
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,569
I told you not to get
Chief involved.

487
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,069
You don't need to add this
to your plate of concerns,

488
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,569
just forget the whole thing
happened...

489
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,539
Mouch, I outrank him.

490
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,109
When I say that you have
to cancel, you have to cancel,

491
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,909
and that is an order.

492
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,450
When you're right, you're right.

493
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,250
You know what?
The two of you,

494
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,520
get out of my office.
Now.

495
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,029
Trudy did not put a ring on you.

496
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,890
I know, you're right.

497
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,929
Truck 81, truck 66, squad 3,

498
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:37,000
ambo 61, structure fire,
2000 South Pellerton.

499
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,849
Hurry up!
Hurry up! Hurry up!

500
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,689
Hurry up, my wife!
She's still in the office!

501
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:54,989
Just your wife?
No customers?

502
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,759
No, just... just her!
Please hurry!

503
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,120
She was in the office!

504
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,689
- Where's the office?
- It's in the back!

505
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,259
- It's all the way in the back!
- What do we have here?

506
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,629
We got one victim inside,
probably in the back office.

507
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,260
We don't have long before
that truss roof comes down.

508
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,829
Cruz, Otis.

509
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,769
- Try and enter from the back.
- On it.

510
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:09,839
No, but... but the... but...

511
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,700
but the office is straight back!

512
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,169
It's not far!
I'll show you!

513
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:14,770
Sir!
Sir, you can't go in there.

514
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,109
The roof is about to collapse.

515
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,779
They'll get her
from the back entrance.

516
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,109
But what if she's not there?

517
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,210
What if she tried
to come back this way?

518
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,649
Chief, let me take a man
in and see.

519
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,819
I don't like it, Casey.

520
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,619
Please, man.
Please, please.

521
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,019
Please, help my wife, Michelle.

522
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,720
- Please.
- I'll go with you.

523
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,629
Chief, let us go halfway in.
We'll turn right around.

524
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,929
30 seconds, tops.

525
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,259
Cruz, Otis.
What have you got?

526
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,529
Can't get in yet.

527
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:38,899
Having trouble with the door.

528
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,830
Let's get a saw back here.

529
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,869
Got it, Chief.

530
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,000
Hey, hey!
Hey, sir!

531
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,869
Hey!

532
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,039
Hey!
Go get him.

533
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,540
Herrmann!
Thermal cam.

534
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,109
Got it!

535
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,679
All right, Dawson.
You and me.

536
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,279
Stay close, within arm's reach.
You got that?

537
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,019
Got it.

538
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,590
He didn't get far,
I can tell you that much.

539
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:07,130
- Ready? Let's go.
- Yep.

540
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,070
Hey, buddy!
Where'd you go?

541
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,309
Hey, look for footsteps.

542
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,580
Got it.

543
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:39,660
Fire department.
Call out!

544
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,300
I got something!

545
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:54,109
Casey, I think got him!

546
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,180
Dawson!
Where the hell'd you go?

547
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,890
Hey, I found him.
Next aisle over.

548
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,140
Hey, I got him.

549
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,909
Come on.
Right here, buddy.

550
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,879
That was a bad move, pal!

551
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,249
You got to let us do our job.

552
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,649
I don't want
to live without her.

553
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,540
Don't speak, buddy.
Just take a deep breath.

554
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,420
No, I don't want
to live without her!

555
00:32:41,421 --> 00:32:44,389
Just come on.

556
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,990
Breathe in.

557
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,199
- Come on.
- Michelle.

558
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,270
- Michelle! Oh, baby!
- Malcolm.

559
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,439
Guy must have lost his mind,
running in like that.

560
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,009
Ah, that's marriage, brother.

561
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,279
I'd do anything for Cindy,

562
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,340
no matter
what might happen to me.

563
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:24,400
I need to go home.

564
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,739
Yeah, you do.

565
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,770
Was kind of hoping
you'd fight me on that one.

566
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,840
Before I met you, I was doing...

567
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:43,019
whatever I could to keep Shay
out of my head.

568
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,919
Went out drinking
and partying every night.

569
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,350
That was my escape.

570
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,729
But then I met you.

571
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:56,199
And the thing I realized is...

572
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,069
I'm your escape.

573
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,799
And as long
as you're here with me,

574
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:08,439
you're not gonna go home
and face your family.

575
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,780
But that's the only way
you're gonna get through this.

576
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,850
I really liked
being here with you.

577
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,760
I'd keep you here forever
if I could, I really would.

578
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,529
But that'd be for me.

579
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:34,800
Not for you.

580
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,290
Trudy.

581
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,800
Trudy, I can explain.

582
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,569
I'm not supposed to be here.

583
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:17,309
I mean, I am, but it's...
it's all a big misunderstanding.

584
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,379
Maybe you shouldn't
record your misunderstandings

585
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:23,179
in your Filofax, hon.

586
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,019
I know how it looks,

587
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,289
but when Dr. Lu gets here,
you can ask her yourself...

588
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:28,290
Kim's not coming.

589
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:30,319
Her name's Kim?

590
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,089
I paid a visit to her office.

591
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,829
What... did you tell her?

592
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:40,499
I told her it was
all a big misunderstanding

593
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,270
and she gave me
your CFD clearance.

594
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:57,079
See, this is why
we're perfect together.

595
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:00,350
You can make the calls
that I can't.

596
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:11,129
You are buying me a very big
porterhouse steak tonight.

597
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,270
Waiter.

598
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,639
Mm, Dawson!

599
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,139
Next round's on me.

600
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:21,639
Fine by me.

601
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,910
Hey.

602
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,449
I've dated a lot
of jerks my whole life.

603
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:30,479
I'm sorry to hear that.

604
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,419
Well, not as sorry as I am.

605
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,589
I've never been out with someone

606
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,520
who was actually nice to me.

607
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,990
That's crazy, huh?

608
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,529
I... I'm not one to judge.

609
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:44,229
I never really
had the best instincts

610
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,160
for this kind of stuff.

611
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:51,000
I think you do.

612
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:54,939
I think you and me going out
on a date

613
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,610
could be a really good idea.

614
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,980
Yeah?

615
00:37:02,981 --> 00:37:05,050
Yeah.

616
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:02,139
No.

617
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:05,210
Keep it.

618
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:17,489
I know impulsively
marrying a hot guy

619
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:22,329
that you meet in Las Vegas
is pretty crazy but...

620
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:24,599
considering all that, I think...

621
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,260
I think we made it work.

622
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:36,709
I don't regret it
for one second.

623
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,609
And I'm not sure if I'd be
in one piece right now

624
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:43,080
if I didn't come home
with you from Vegas.

625
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:50,789
I know I wouldn't be.

626
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:54,060
Then I'd say we had the most
successful marriage in history.

627
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,700
I love you, Kelly.

628
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:12,740
It feels so weird to say that
when we're saying good-bye.

629
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:20,620
Maybe... I love you, too.

630
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,370
Okay.

631
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:28,689
Hey, thanks for staying late.

632
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:31,289
Yeah, no problem.

633
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:32,789
- It's a weird day, anyway.
- Yeah.

634
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,729
Not really sure
I want to go home yet.

635
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:36,529
I don't blame you.
I'm gonna have a beer.

636
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,759
You want one?

637
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,869
Sure.

638
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:44,639
Oh, for the record, I thought
you handled Lullo really well.

639
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,539
I felt for the guy.

640
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,809
How are you handling things?

641
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:53,349
I don't mean to pry, I just...

642
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,879
Seeing you sitting
in that shower stall,

643
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,849
knowing that you're upset...

644
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,819
It's hard, you know, not being
able to talk to each other,

645
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,890
like we used to.

646
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:12,160
Things between me and Casey
are... It's tough.

647
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:15,299
It's... It's tougher
than I thought it would be.

648
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,469
Yeah, it's a lot
of pressure working together.

649
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,900
- I don't know how you guys do it.
- That's the thing,

650
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:23,539
it's not the work part
that's tough.

651
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:29,919
It's... It's the...
It's the home part.

652
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,190
I honestly don't really know
what to do.

653
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,970
Hey, Matt.

654
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:54,870
Matt.
Matt!

655
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,580
- Hey...
- Matt!

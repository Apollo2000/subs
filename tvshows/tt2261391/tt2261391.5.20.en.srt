1
00:00:02,063 --> 00:00:04,063
Mayday. Emergency. Gas explosion.

2
00:00:04,098 --> 00:00:05,465
Firefighters down.

3
00:00:07,261 --> 00:00:10,016
I screwed up.
I deliberately broke protocol.

4
00:00:10,078 --> 00:00:12,012
It's my fault that they're dead.

5
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:14,723
Don't do this, Jason...
taking the blame.

6
00:00:14,757 --> 00:00:16,658
You don't tell the truth
about what happened,

7
00:00:16,692 --> 00:00:18,829
you'll never ride a rig again.

8
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:21,496
- What's the prognosis?
- The cancer's in my bones.

9
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:23,398
My odds are not good.

10
00:00:23,432 --> 00:00:24,666
I'm not thinking about odds,

11
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,568
I'm here and so are you

12
00:00:26,602 --> 00:00:28,770
and that's enough.

13
00:00:55,031 --> 00:00:56,998
Her latest numbers look good.

14
00:00:57,033 --> 00:00:59,701
It's a big jump for
just a couple days treatment.

15
00:00:59,735 --> 00:01:01,670
Yeah, she just hasn't been eating,

16
00:01:01,704 --> 00:01:03,305
and she's sleeping all the time.

17
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:05,840
That's the chemo.
Not much we can do about that.

18
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:09,044
Hey, ladies, quit gossiping about me.

19
00:01:09,078 --> 00:01:11,880
Doc says you're doing great.

20
00:01:11,914 --> 00:01:14,849
Yeah, well, no offense, Doc,
but my definition of great

21
00:01:14,884 --> 00:01:17,385
doesn't include tossing
my cookies every hour.

22
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,387
I'm sorry about that, Anna.

23
00:01:19,422 --> 00:01:21,556
I'll order you something for that.

24
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:23,558
Hang in there.

25
00:01:23,593 --> 00:01:25,460
It's good.

26
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:32,467
- I'm gonna take the shift off.
- Come on, Kelly.

27
00:01:32,501 --> 00:01:35,303
You've been watching me sleep
for, like, two days.

28
00:01:35,338 --> 00:01:37,305
My dad's gonna be here in,
like, half an hour.

29
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,907
- Just go to work.
- I don't mind.

30
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:40,575
Go!

31
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,677
I'm fine.

32
00:01:45,948 --> 00:01:47,983
Just a phone call away.

33
00:01:51,621 --> 00:01:53,588
So...

34
00:01:53,623 --> 00:01:55,757
How'd it go with Kannell?

35
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:58,927
He's determined to take the fall.

36
00:01:58,961 --> 00:02:00,862
Protecting Doyle's memory.

37
00:02:00,896 --> 00:02:03,665
It'd be noble as hell if
he weren't tanking his career.

38
00:02:03,699 --> 00:02:05,600
Well, that's his choice.

39
00:02:05,635 --> 00:02:08,503
The case is being closed
at today's monthly review panel.

40
00:02:08,537 --> 00:02:10,405
So we go to the panel.
Ask them to postpone it.

41
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,673
We don't have the standing.

42
00:02:11,707 --> 00:02:13,041
Kannell is sticking to his story.

43
00:02:13,075 --> 00:02:15,910
Then we gotta change the story somehow.

44
00:02:18,814 --> 00:02:21,516
Okay.

45
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,585
Whatever you need.

46
00:02:28,057 --> 00:02:29,891
Hey, I'm not gonna
rush into this and end up

47
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:31,526
with some serial killer, okay?

48
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,961
Then you can pay the extra rent.

49
00:02:32,995 --> 00:02:35,864
What, you guys still looking
for a roommate?

50
00:02:35,898 --> 00:02:37,632
In your place? Where would you put them?

51
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:39,901
A three bedroom unit
just opened up in our building.

52
00:02:39,935 --> 00:02:41,636
Those are great.

53
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:43,638
Yeah, so Otis said, "Let's grab one."

54
00:02:43,673 --> 00:02:45,974
"We'll get a third roommate.
It'll be cheaper," he said.

55
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:48,443
One third of more money
is less than half of less money.

56
00:02:48,477 --> 00:02:49,911
That's just math.

57
00:02:49,945 --> 00:02:52,714
So we moved in and lined up Levantini.

58
00:02:52,748 --> 00:02:54,983
- From first shift.
- But his girlfriend asked him

59
00:02:55,017 --> 00:02:57,452
to move in with her,
so now we're screwed.

60
00:02:57,486 --> 00:03:00,722
This was supposed to
save me money, not cast me.

61
00:03:00,756 --> 00:03:02,891
Leon is starting
community college in Florida,

62
00:03:02,925 --> 00:03:05,160
and Cruz is footing the bill.

63
00:03:05,194 --> 00:03:07,729
I get this new bouncer gig
and that helps, but...

64
00:03:07,763 --> 00:03:10,732
What about me?

65
00:03:10,766 --> 00:03:12,567
For a roommate.

66
00:03:12,601 --> 00:03:14,736
'Cause I've been going nuts
trying to find a new place

67
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,405
within my price range before
my landlord doubles my rent,

68
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,141
so it would really help me out.

69
00:03:20,176 --> 00:03:22,610
And you know
I'm not a serial killer, so...

70
00:03:22,645 --> 00:03:25,780
- Do we?
- Just think about it.

71
00:03:27,717 --> 00:03:29,417
People in this house really can't help

72
00:03:29,452 --> 00:03:31,419
moving in with each other?

73
00:03:31,454 --> 00:03:32,921
It's like a compulsion.

74
00:03:32,955 --> 00:03:35,757
Wai... didn't you invite
Severide to stay with you

75
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:39,094
after he moved out of Casey's?

76
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:40,595
That was different.

77
00:03:41,797 --> 00:03:43,098
- Yeah.
<i>- Squad 3, Engine 51.</i>

78
00:03:43,132 --> 00:03:44,699
- It was.
- Yeah, waga, waga, waga.

79
00:03:44,734 --> 00:03:46,634
- Big difference.
<i>- Structure fire.</i>

80
00:04:04,754 --> 00:04:06,054
Capp, Tony, you guys vent.

81
00:04:06,088 --> 00:04:07,455
Cruz, through the front with me.

82
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,524
- Yup.
- Got it.

83
00:04:11,761 --> 00:04:13,728
Hello?

84
00:04:13,763 --> 00:04:15,830
Fire Department! Call out!

85
00:04:18,768 --> 00:04:20,635
Hello?

86
00:04:23,672 --> 00:04:25,807
Hey, 51.

87
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:27,152
We're gonna need a line in the kitchen.

88
00:04:27,176 --> 00:04:29,477
<i>Copy that, Squad 3.</i>

89
00:04:29,512 --> 00:04:30,979
Lieutenant!

90
00:04:33,182 --> 00:04:35,016
Hey, ma'am?

91
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,019
Ma'am, hey, you're gonna
have to come with us.

92
00:04:58,741 --> 00:04:59,741
Lieutenant!

93
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:04,439
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx

94
00:05:05,897 --> 00:05:07,426
Ma'am! Can you hear me?

95
00:05:07,514 --> 00:05:09,281
We gotta get you out of here!

96
00:05:15,622 --> 00:05:17,222
- Come on. We got you.
- No.

97
00:05:17,257 --> 00:05:19,057
- We got you, come on.
- No, I'm okay.

98
00:05:19,092 --> 00:05:22,327
- One, two...
- I'm okay.

99
00:05:22,362 --> 00:05:25,898
Come on.

100
00:05:25,932 --> 00:05:28,500
Fire's headed for the eaves.
Get a line on that back roof.

101
00:05:28,535 --> 00:05:30,836
Copy that, Lieutenant.

102
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,006
- There.
- Lay down. We got you.

103
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,009
Running from firefighters?

104
00:05:37,043 --> 00:05:38,521
A couple pictures
aren't worth your life.

105
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:41,446
That house is my whole life.

106
00:05:44,551 --> 00:05:47,486
- We'll save what we can.
- Thank you.

107
00:05:51,691 --> 00:05:53,458
Think this guy'll listen?

108
00:05:53,493 --> 00:05:56,028
Of all the Chiefs on
the panel, he's our best bet.

109
00:05:56,062 --> 00:05:57,629
- Harry!
- Wallace.

110
00:05:57,664 --> 00:05:59,498
I'm already running late,
but you knew that.

111
00:05:59,532 --> 00:06:01,043
Just need a moment of your time before

112
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:02,378
- you go into the panel.
- Who's this?

113
00:06:02,402 --> 00:06:04,369
Chief Harry Moran,
Lieutenant Matt Casey.

114
00:06:04,404 --> 00:06:06,371
- The alderman.
- Yes, sir.

115
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:08,273
I wanted to talk to you about
the Squad 6

116
00:06:08,308 --> 00:06:11,376
sewer tunnel incident.
We've already lost so many men.

117
00:06:11,411 --> 00:06:13,378
I'd hate to see us lose Kannell, too.

118
00:06:13,413 --> 00:06:15,347
I think getting two firefighters killed

119
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:17,516
is a pretty good reason to end a career.

120
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,518
Unless he wasn't the one who screwed up.

121
00:06:19,552 --> 00:06:21,687
He's already admitted as such.

122
00:06:21,721 --> 00:06:25,557
All due respect, sir,
it wasn't Kannell's fault.

123
00:06:25,592 --> 00:06:27,893
It was Doyle's.

124
00:06:27,927 --> 00:06:29,561
That's a hell of an accusation to make

125
00:06:29,596 --> 00:06:31,396
of a man who can't defend himself.

126
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:33,198
The way Kannell says it went down...

127
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:35,144
him dropping the meter,
running back to the rig...

128
00:06:35,168 --> 00:06:37,002
we're talking 50 feet.

129
00:06:37,036 --> 00:06:39,215
If those levels were normal
before he dropped the meter...

130
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:42,074
There's no way the air
saturated while he ran 50 feet.

131
00:06:42,108 --> 00:06:44,009
The only way
this could've happened is if

132
00:06:44,043 --> 00:06:47,079
Doyle got a high reading, and
then took them in there anyway.

133
00:06:47,113 --> 00:06:48,714
Then why is Kannell taking the blame?

134
00:06:48,748 --> 00:06:50,693
Because he didn't want
Doyle's wife and kids to think

135
00:06:50,717 --> 00:06:55,087
he died anything but a hero...
and neither do we.

136
00:06:55,121 --> 00:06:57,356
What if there were another option?

137
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,225
One that clears Kannell,
and keeps Doyle out of it?

138
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,327
I'm all ears.

139
00:07:17,744 --> 00:07:19,177
You okay?

140
00:07:19,212 --> 00:07:20,712
Yeah, I'm just...

141
00:07:20,747 --> 00:07:22,714
just looking up stuff for Anna.

142
00:07:24,117 --> 00:07:27,452
Homeopathic?

143
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,022
That's pretty far out for you.

144
00:07:30,056 --> 00:07:31,556
She's just always so damn tired.

145
00:07:31,591 --> 00:07:33,558
She's barely eating.

146
00:07:33,593 --> 00:07:37,029
- Chemo side effects?
- Yeah. One says acupuncture.

147
00:07:37,063 --> 00:07:39,031
One says massage, one...

148
00:07:39,065 --> 00:07:42,134
Ginger milk thistle...

149
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:56,214
When I was in rehab...

150
00:07:56,249 --> 00:07:59,718
everybody had a different theory
about how to get through it.

151
00:07:59,752 --> 00:08:01,586
Drink a lot of water.

152
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:04,456
Don't drink any water.

153
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,159
Blah, blah, blah.

154
00:08:07,193 --> 00:08:10,162
Know what got me through it?

155
00:08:10,196 --> 00:08:14,166
Hamburger and French fries.

156
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,334
Every day.

157
00:08:19,505 --> 00:08:21,573
Give Anna my best.

158
00:08:23,343 --> 00:08:25,410
We're all thinking about her over here.

159
00:08:34,187 --> 00:08:35,687
Okay. Hear me out.

160
00:08:35,722 --> 00:08:37,689
The whole appeal of Levantini

161
00:08:37,724 --> 00:08:39,524
was that he was from a different shift.

162
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,526
Okay, but I'm so quiet,

163
00:08:41,561 --> 00:08:43,362
it'll be like I'm on a different shift.

164
00:08:43,396 --> 00:08:46,031
Yes, because you're so low-key

165
00:08:46,065 --> 00:08:48,533
and unobtrusive.

166
00:08:48,568 --> 00:08:50,435
Look, Brett, no offense, it's just...

167
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,304
I don't know about
having a girl roommate.

168
00:08:52,338 --> 00:08:53,839
Okay, but I'm not just any girl.

169
00:08:53,873 --> 00:08:56,308
I spend a third of every week
surrounded by men.

170
00:08:56,342 --> 00:08:58,543
I know enough not to
hang my bra on the shower rod,

171
00:08:58,578 --> 00:09:02,114
and I can tell a good dirty joke
when I need to.

172
00:09:02,148 --> 00:09:04,716
Let's hear one.

173
00:09:04,751 --> 00:09:06,518
Yup. She's got nothing.

174
00:09:06,552 --> 00:09:08,687
- What about the parking space?
- Yes! Look.

175
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:11,289
The landlord only gave us
one parking spot in the garage,

176
00:09:11,324 --> 00:09:13,291
which me and Otis
are already trading off on,

177
00:09:13,326 --> 00:09:14,826
which sucks, by the way.

178
00:09:14,861 --> 00:09:16,495
I'll park on the street.

179
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:18,663
You're gonna love that
come December.

180
00:09:18,698 --> 00:09:20,876
You know what, just write down
every question you would ask

181
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,735
any other potential roommate...
a man, a stranger,

182
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,405
and if I pass, I get to move in.

183
00:09:28,241 --> 00:09:30,642
<i>Ambulance 61. Person injured from fall.</i>

184
00:09:30,676 --> 00:09:34,546
<i>725 Barrington Avenue.</i>

185
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,548
You guys, over here.

186
00:09:36,582 --> 00:09:38,360
I don't know what happened.
I thought I had her.

187
00:09:38,384 --> 00:09:39,885
The rope slipped out of my hands.

188
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,353
Let me look at your hands.

189
00:09:41,387 --> 00:09:43,221
Hey.

190
00:09:43,256 --> 00:09:45,157
- What's your name?
- Laurie.

191
00:09:45,191 --> 00:09:48,427
Hey, Laurie. I'm Gabby. This is Sylvie.

192
00:09:48,461 --> 00:09:51,163
This place is closed.

193
00:09:51,197 --> 00:09:53,432
- What are you guys doing here?
- We snuck in.

194
00:09:53,466 --> 00:09:56,868
- Thought it'd be fun.
- It was my idea, not Aidan's.

195
00:09:56,903 --> 00:09:59,404
You... you guys aren't gonna
call the cops, are you?

196
00:10:01,441 --> 00:10:03,742
Hey, Brett?

197
00:10:03,776 --> 00:10:05,444
Yeah, what's going on?

198
00:10:05,478 --> 00:10:07,446
Spinal fluid.

199
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,449
Separation between
her skull and her C-1.

200
00:10:12,485 --> 00:10:14,296
All right, Laurie.
I want you to do me a favor.

201
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,480
I want you to squeeze my hand
as hard as you can, okay?

202
00:10:20,927 --> 00:10:23,128
Good job.

203
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:30,426
Okay, so Laurie, it's possible
you have something called

204
00:10:30,451 --> 00:10:31,795
an internal decapitation.

205
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:33,678
I need you to stay completely still.

206
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,458
I'm gonna be right here to help you

207
00:10:35,483 --> 00:10:37,584
so that you don't move at all.

208
00:10:37,618 --> 00:10:39,137
- Okay.
- All right, we can't risk

209
00:10:39,162 --> 00:10:40,420
putting her on the backboard.

210
00:10:40,454 --> 00:10:42,265
I'm gonna grab the scoop
stretcher and head rolls.

211
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:44,315
- And spider straps!
- Yeah.

212
00:10:46,903 --> 00:10:48,404
Stay calm.

213
00:10:48,429 --> 00:10:51,031
Stay calm for me.

214
00:10:51,065 --> 00:10:53,967
So how long have you guys been together?

215
00:10:58,406 --> 00:11:00,540
Yeah, like, a month.

216
00:11:00,581 --> 00:11:02,883
We met on Saint Patrick's Day,

217
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,045
but he didn't text me
for, like, three weeks.

218
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:06,980
Sounds like a player.

219
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:08,848
No, he's sweet.

220
00:11:08,883 --> 00:11:11,985
All right, Aidan. I want you to tuck in
on Laurie's side right there.

221
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:14,521
We're gonna slide
these two pieces underneath her

222
00:11:14,555 --> 00:11:15,922
until we feel the middle connect.

223
00:11:15,956 --> 00:11:17,857
Really slow, really gently.

224
00:11:17,892 --> 00:11:19,726
Then we're gonna take these head rolls.

225
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,505
We're gonna put them
on either side of her neck.

226
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:23,730
You're doing great.
Just stay calm for me.

227
00:11:27,768 --> 00:11:29,164
You're doing great.

228
00:11:29,252 --> 00:11:31,553
Feet first.

229
00:11:33,707 --> 00:11:35,608
- I'm scared.
- I know you are, honey,

230
00:11:35,643 --> 00:11:37,777
but you're doing great. Okay, guys,

231
00:11:37,812 --> 00:11:39,879
on my count. One...

232
00:11:39,914 --> 00:11:42,515
two, three.

233
00:11:44,407 --> 00:11:46,842
- Head rolls.
- Take one.

234
00:11:46,954 --> 00:11:48,455
Hold this in really tight.

235
00:11:56,823 --> 00:11:59,055
Doing a good job.

236
00:12:03,104 --> 00:12:05,092
Okay.

237
00:12:06,287 --> 00:12:08,041
Let's secure her with the spider straps

238
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:09,542
and get her to Med.

239
00:12:09,577 --> 00:12:11,611
Good job.

240
00:12:13,313 --> 00:12:14,524
Excuse me?

241
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:16,517
I'm looking for Lieutenant Severide.

242
00:12:16,838 --> 00:12:18,505
Yeah, you found him. How can I help you?

243
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,840
I'm Hope Norwich.

244
00:12:19,874 --> 00:12:21,642
You saved my mom, Ellie, this morning.

245
00:12:21,676 --> 00:12:23,836
I just wanted to bring you
some cookies as a thank you.

246
00:12:25,613 --> 00:12:27,348
Thank you. How's...

247
00:12:27,382 --> 00:12:28,916
how is she doing?

248
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,352
Doctor said she only has
minor smoke inhalation.

249
00:12:31,386 --> 00:12:32,920
Mom's pretty tough.

250
00:12:32,954 --> 00:12:34,955
- I noticed.
- Yeah, she's already

251
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,458
back in the house.
Claims the bedroom's fine,

252
00:12:37,492 --> 00:12:39,360
and she'll clean the rest as she goes.

253
00:12:39,394 --> 00:12:42,596
The fire was in the roof.
It's not safe.

254
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,765
I figured.
I called the city about having

255
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,500
the property condemned, but even then,

256
00:12:46,534 --> 00:12:49,937
if she refuses to go, I'll have
to call the police to remove her.

257
00:12:49,971 --> 00:12:52,473
She is the most stubborn woman
on the planet.

258
00:12:52,507 --> 00:12:56,291
Anyway, I just wanted
to thank you for helping her.

259
00:12:56,411 --> 00:12:58,229
Sure.

260
00:13:01,024 --> 00:13:02,858
What does Baba's
favorite knitting stitch

261
00:13:02,884 --> 00:13:04,395
have to do with me being
a good roommate?

262
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:06,653
It shows that you pay attention.

263
00:13:06,688 --> 00:13:09,223
Fine. A garter stitch.

264
00:13:09,257 --> 00:13:10,724
- Ooh!
- Sorry!

265
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:13,293
The answer we were looking
for was "Stockinette."

266
00:13:13,328 --> 00:13:15,396
Minus 3,000 points.

267
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,297
What?

268
00:13:17,332 --> 00:13:19,043
That "Battlestar Galactica"
question I got right

269
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:20,501
was only worth a hundred!

270
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:22,503
The points are at the discretion

271
00:13:22,537 --> 00:13:24,164
of the management, I'm afraid.

272
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:26,857
Now on to a more delicate subject.

273
00:13:27,008 --> 00:13:29,617
You and Cruz used to date.

274
00:13:29,744 --> 00:13:32,961
You and I, we had a moment.

275
00:13:33,081 --> 00:13:35,743
Now if you had to choo...

276
00:13:35,768 --> 00:13:37,851
You know what,
don't even finish that question.

277
00:13:37,886 --> 00:13:39,420
Minus 2,000 points.

278
00:13:39,454 --> 00:13:41,422
Come on!

279
00:13:41,456 --> 00:13:43,424
Okay. Forget it.
I'm gonna sleep in my car.

280
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,325
No, no. Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, all right?

281
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,760
You can still win it all back?

282
00:13:46,795 --> 00:13:48,996
The final question is worth...

283
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:52,399
wait for it...

284
00:13:52,434 --> 00:13:54,902
11,000 points!

285
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:57,905
Two guards stand in front of two doors.

286
00:13:57,939 --> 00:14:00,774
- One door leads to heaven.
- The other to hell.

287
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:02,843
One guard always tells the truth,

288
00:14:02,869 --> 00:14:04,503
The other always lies.

289
00:14:04,546 --> 00:14:07,468
You may ask one guard one question.

290
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:10,358
What is your question?

291
00:14:11,553 --> 00:14:14,023
Who wants a parking spot?

292
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,624
Let me be more specific.

293
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:21,350
How about three parking spots?

294
00:14:21,563 --> 00:14:24,537
One for each of us, which
I negotiated with the landlord.

295
00:14:24,688 --> 00:14:27,810
And FYI, your landlord loves me.

296
00:14:27,844 --> 00:14:29,745
I brought him baklava,

297
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:32,080
so you're not getting this deal
with any other roommate.

298
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,287
Congratulations, roomie!

299
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:41,223
- Welcome!
- Yay!

300
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,797
My God.

301
00:14:48,832 --> 00:14:50,799
What do I smell?

302
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:52,401
Guess.

303
00:14:52,435 --> 00:14:54,937
A cheeseburger from Small Cheval?

304
00:14:54,971 --> 00:14:56,738
- And fries.
- Bring it here!

305
00:14:58,274 --> 00:15:00,409
You really do love me, don't you?

306
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,747
I do.

307
00:15:07,183 --> 00:15:09,084
And I love you.

308
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:14,990
All right, all right.
Enough of this schmlatzy crap.

309
00:15:15,024 --> 00:15:17,759
- Can I eat now?
- Go, go, go, go, go.

310
00:15:20,497 --> 00:15:22,764
It's good, isn't it?

311
00:15:25,869 --> 00:15:27,369
They got you on something new?

312
00:15:27,403 --> 00:15:30,706
I started to run a fever
so they put me on

313
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,508
an antibiotic just to be safe.

314
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:35,844
- Everything else good?
- Supposedly.

315
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:37,513
My God, this is so good.

316
00:15:37,547 --> 00:15:39,314
What... what are those cookies?

317
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,784
Thanks from a woman today.

318
00:15:42,819 --> 00:15:45,120
We pulled her mom out of a burning house

319
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:47,299
and the old lady kept running
back in trying to save things.

320
00:15:47,323 --> 00:15:50,459
- Nearly got herself killed.
- What kind of things?

321
00:15:50,493 --> 00:15:52,394
Family pictures.

322
00:15:52,428 --> 00:15:54,997
Daughter stopped by and said
that she already moved back in.

323
00:15:55,031 --> 00:15:58,333
- She refuses to move out.
- Was that safe?

324
00:15:58,368 --> 00:16:01,436
No. Probably not, but...

325
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:06,208
Woman loves her house.

326
00:16:06,242 --> 00:16:10,012
It's not about the house.

327
00:16:10,046 --> 00:16:12,014
When you have to really, like,
look at the things

328
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:16,885
that you're scared of losing,
it's not...

329
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,497
it's not the things
you don't want to let go of.

330
00:16:18,521 --> 00:16:19,888
It's just...

331
00:16:19,923 --> 00:16:21,823
- it's just this.
- Hey.

332
00:16:21,858 --> 00:16:23,825
Hey.

333
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,494
Anna, you don't have to
worry about that.

334
00:16:25,528 --> 00:16:28,363
I'm right here.

335
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,366
Yeah.

336
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:33,535
Anyway...

337
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,238
I bet once you go talk to her,
you'll find out

338
00:16:36,272 --> 00:16:37,940
it's not the things for her, either.

339
00:16:37,974 --> 00:16:41,209
When you find out what it is,
you can help her.

340
00:16:43,146 --> 00:16:46,448
Who says I'm gonna go talk to her?

341
00:16:46,482 --> 00:16:49,551
I did.

342
00:17:03,037 --> 00:17:05,080
- I already told...
- You're cleared.

343
00:17:05,468 --> 00:17:06,989
What?

344
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,192
Boden and I talked to Chief Moran.

345
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,939
The panel chalked the whole thing up

346
00:17:10,974 --> 00:17:13,973
to equipment failure.
Saying the meter was faulty.

347
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:16,478
But that's not what happened.

348
00:17:16,512 --> 00:17:18,480
Doyle's clear. You're clear.

349
00:17:18,514 --> 00:17:21,316
The whole thing's closed for good.

350
00:17:21,351 --> 00:17:25,220
Your job's waiting for you
whenever you're ready.

351
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:27,556
You really don't get it.

352
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,892
That doesn't change anything, Casey.

353
00:17:30,326 --> 00:17:33,736
I watched three men die
and now I'm done with the CFD.

354
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,014
It's over.

355
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:39,101
I'm out.

356
00:18:23,496 --> 00:18:26,465
Hey. Hey, Doc!

357
00:18:26,499 --> 00:18:28,333
What the hell is up with the DNR?

358
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:30,402
Would you give us a minute?

359
00:18:32,338 --> 00:18:34,439
Whether or not to authorize
life-saving measures

360
00:18:34,474 --> 00:18:36,308
- is the patient's choice.
- It's your job

361
00:18:36,342 --> 00:18:38,844
- to tell her not to give up.
- No, it isn't.

362
00:18:38,878 --> 00:18:40,846
You said her numbers
were good. You're optimistic.

363
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,248
I am and so is Anna,

364
00:18:43,282 --> 00:18:46,752
but she also knows that
if treatment stops working,

365
00:18:46,786 --> 00:18:50,522
extreme measure won't turn the tide.

366
00:18:50,556 --> 00:18:52,624
Look, this isn't a white flag.

367
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:54,793
It's a worst case scenario.

368
00:18:54,827 --> 00:18:56,528
She said she had a fever.

369
00:18:56,562 --> 00:18:58,630
She does, but we're treating it.

370
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:02,534
Go home. Get a shower.

371
00:19:02,568 --> 00:19:04,336
Do what you gotta do to get back here

372
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,438
and help her keep fighting.

373
00:19:11,878 --> 00:19:13,845
It's not right.

374
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,447
Kannell did everything he should have,

375
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:17,449
on the call and after.

376
00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:18,984
Really?

377
00:19:19,018 --> 00:19:22,387
You think that lying about
how the call went down

378
00:19:22,422 --> 00:19:23,789
was the right thing?

379
00:19:23,823 --> 00:19:25,657
To protect his lieutenant's good name?

380
00:19:25,692 --> 00:19:27,526
Absolutely.

381
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,696
I'd do it for Boden in a second if...

382
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,364
God forbid.

383
00:19:32,398 --> 00:19:33,965
Me, too.

384
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,470
He can't just give up.

385
00:19:38,504 --> 00:19:42,374
Am I being an ass?

386
00:19:42,408 --> 00:19:44,376
That's a shift.

387
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,055
The guy lost his brothers,
and I'm riding him

388
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:47,813
because he wants to walk away.

389
00:19:49,615 --> 00:19:51,650
Maybe I should let him go.

390
00:19:54,053 --> 00:19:56,388
No, baby.

391
00:19:56,422 --> 00:19:58,824
And quitting isn't exactly who you are.

392
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,563
You fought back after losing Darden

393
00:20:04,597 --> 00:20:08,900
and you got Severide back
after we lost Shay.

394
00:20:08,935 --> 00:20:11,336
You're not gonna
start quitting now, are you?

395
00:20:25,084 --> 00:20:26,918
Hello?

396
00:20:26,953 --> 00:20:29,788
Ma'am? Mrs. Norwich?

397
00:20:29,822 --> 00:20:32,290
- The firefighter.
- Yeah, Kelly.

398
00:20:32,325 --> 00:20:33,458
Severide. How's it going?

399
00:20:33,493 --> 00:20:35,293
I got it covered.

400
00:20:35,328 --> 00:20:37,072
Okay, well, your daughter
stopped in the firehouse

401
00:20:37,096 --> 00:20:40,532
yesterday, and she seemed
pretty worried about you.

402
00:20:40,566 --> 00:20:42,300
"Worried" is Hope's natural setting.

403
00:20:42,335 --> 00:20:44,469
- I'm fine.
- Okay, well, just so you know,

404
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:45,804
it's not safe to be living here.

405
00:20:45,838 --> 00:20:47,806
What's this nonsense?

406
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,308
All it needs a little cleaning up.

407
00:20:50,343 --> 00:20:53,044
If you really want to be useful,
come help in the kitchen.

408
00:20:54,347 --> 00:20:56,982
Ma'am.

409
00:20:57,016 --> 00:20:59,551
Ma'am?

410
00:20:59,585 --> 00:21:01,052
You ma'am me one more time,

411
00:21:01,087 --> 00:21:02,821
you'll be wearing what's in that bucket.

412
00:21:02,855 --> 00:21:05,390
It's Ellie.

413
00:21:05,424 --> 00:21:06,992
Ellie, nice to meet you.

414
00:21:07,026 --> 00:21:08,804
Look, I know that
you've probably been living here

415
00:21:08,828 --> 00:21:11,062
- for a long time...
- 37 years.

416
00:21:11,097 --> 00:21:12,831
But it's gonna take
a lot more than cleaning

417
00:21:12,865 --> 00:21:14,466
to make this place safe.

418
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,468
The roof supports have been destroyed.

419
00:21:16,502 --> 00:21:18,480
Not to mention the exposed
insulation is a health hazard.

420
00:21:18,504 --> 00:21:19,938
It's too dangerous.

421
00:21:19,972 --> 00:21:22,007
This place has stood here
for a long time.

422
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,075
I'm sure it has a few more years in it.

423
00:21:30,683 --> 00:21:32,751
What's your story?

424
00:21:33,953 --> 00:21:35,921
Sorry?

425
00:21:35,955 --> 00:21:37,923
You have something weighing on you.

426
00:21:43,162 --> 00:21:45,931
Someone that I care about is sick.

427
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:48,466
It's my girlfriend.

428
00:21:48,501 --> 00:21:51,469
It's bad?

429
00:21:51,504 --> 00:21:54,472
It's cancer, but she's...

430
00:21:54,507 --> 00:21:56,141
She's fighting. She's gonna beat it.

431
00:21:56,175 --> 00:21:58,043
Good.

432
00:21:58,077 --> 00:22:00,445
True love...

433
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:02,647
like Hal and I had,
made a life worth living.

434
00:22:02,682 --> 00:22:04,649
Hal's your husband?

435
00:22:04,684 --> 00:22:06,518
Was.

436
00:22:06,552 --> 00:22:08,520
Had a heart attack last summer.

437
00:22:08,554 --> 00:22:11,056
No warning.

438
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,558
We built this place.

439
00:22:13,593 --> 00:22:15,193
That backsplash,

440
00:22:15,228 --> 00:22:19,164
I hand painted every one of those tiles.

441
00:22:19,198 --> 00:22:21,633
These marks,

442
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:26,137
this is where we marked
Hope's height every six months.

443
00:22:26,172 --> 00:22:28,006
Till she was 18.

444
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,542
Ellie, I get it. I understand.

445
00:22:30,576 --> 00:22:33,812
You understand, do you?

446
00:22:33,846 --> 00:22:35,824
You understand what it's like
to think you're gonna spend

447
00:22:35,848 --> 00:22:38,149
the rest of your life with someone,

448
00:22:38,184 --> 00:22:41,019
and then one day,
all you have is memories?

449
00:22:45,925 --> 00:22:48,894
I'm sorry.

450
00:22:48,928 --> 00:22:50,896
You just...

451
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,498
make sure you grab
all the memories you can.

452
00:22:57,937 --> 00:23:00,071
Man.

453
00:23:00,106 --> 00:23:02,107
We are two sorry sons of bitches?

454
00:23:05,144 --> 00:23:07,612
You wanna...

455
00:23:07,647 --> 00:23:10,048
Drag that stove out to the curb for me?

456
00:23:10,082 --> 00:23:13,051
And then get back to your girlfriend.

457
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:15,520
Bring her some flowers from my garden.

458
00:23:18,257 --> 00:23:20,525
Yeah, sure.

459
00:23:46,819 --> 00:23:49,120
Hey, Snow White!

460
00:23:49,155 --> 00:23:50,722
What happened in here?

461
00:23:50,756 --> 00:23:52,157
I just straightened up a bit.

462
00:23:52,191 --> 00:23:54,926
I think it looks great!

463
00:23:54,961 --> 00:23:56,795
Where my door chair stuff?

464
00:23:56,829 --> 00:23:58,496
- What?
- My door chair stuff.

465
00:23:58,531 --> 00:24:00,265
The stuff that I keep here on the chair.

466
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:02,267
You can't just move
a guy's door chair stuff.

467
00:24:02,301 --> 00:24:03,735
I gotta get to work.

468
00:24:03,769 --> 00:24:05,603
Everything's in the front closet.

469
00:24:05,638 --> 00:24:08,206
What? Who keeps clothes in the closet?

470
00:24:12,311 --> 00:24:14,746
Whoa.

471
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,082
Everything's labeled with
a different font.

472
00:24:17,116 --> 00:24:19,918
The one for winter gloves is all frosty.

473
00:24:19,952 --> 00:24:22,520
See, easy peasy.

474
00:24:22,555 --> 00:24:25,123
Not as easy as my door chair, though.

475
00:24:35,034 --> 00:24:38,303
Jason?

476
00:24:38,337 --> 00:24:41,606
Jason, I know you're here.
Your car's out front.

477
00:24:45,878 --> 00:24:48,613
Fine, just listen.

478
00:24:50,883 --> 00:24:53,351
I've been here.

479
00:24:53,386 --> 00:24:57,322
I've lost people.

480
00:24:57,356 --> 00:25:01,192
But if we quit because of
the ones that don't make it,

481
00:25:01,227 --> 00:25:05,063
we quit on all the people
we could save in the future.

482
00:25:05,097 --> 00:25:08,566
I know you love being a firefighter.

483
00:25:08,601 --> 00:25:10,201
It's in your blood.

484
00:25:12,238 --> 00:25:14,774
So when you're ready, just...

485
00:25:16,075 --> 00:25:18,143
come find me.

486
00:25:47,407 --> 00:25:49,008
How's it looking?

487
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:50,904
Had to talk a couple of
college girls from dancing

488
00:25:50,928 --> 00:25:52,256
on the tables, but other than that,

489
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,982
- it's been pretty quiet.
- What the hell, dude?

490
00:25:55,016 --> 00:25:57,051
- No, man. You're done.
- I said go get me a beer!

491
00:25:57,085 --> 00:25:58,819
- I think eight's your limit.
- What?

492
00:25:58,853 --> 00:25:59,997
- You're done.
- What did you say?

493
00:26:00,021 --> 00:26:01,155
I said you're done.

494
00:26:01,189 --> 00:26:02,615
Hey, we got a problem here?

495
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,712
Yeah, I got money to spend
and I want a beer.

496
00:26:04,926 --> 00:26:06,070
Yeah, I think you're at your limit.

497
00:26:06,094 --> 00:26:07,761
Thinking ain't your job, okay?

498
00:26:07,796 --> 00:26:09,997
Your job is to take my money
and bring me my beer.

499
00:26:10,031 --> 00:26:11,899
Okay, buddy, hey, time to go.

500
00:26:11,933 --> 00:26:13,678
- I ain't done nothing.
- Look, you're disrupting

501
00:26:13,702 --> 00:26:15,146
the other patrons, all right?
Don't make this a thing.

502
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,171
Get off me, all right?
Go get me a beer, all right?

503
00:26:17,205 --> 00:26:19,139
- I said go get me a beer!
- Come on...

504
00:26:19,174 --> 00:26:21,675
- Get off me.
- Hey, man, take it easy.

505
00:26:30,552 --> 00:26:32,820
Whoa, buddy,
we gotta get you to a hospital.

506
00:26:32,854 --> 00:26:34,922
Get away from me!

507
00:26:48,103 --> 00:26:49,770
You got fired?

508
00:26:49,804 --> 00:26:51,772
You were a bouncer. You bounced him.

509
00:26:51,806 --> 00:26:54,175
Yeah, well, owner says
he didn't specifically tell me

510
00:26:54,209 --> 00:26:57,011
to lay hands on the guy,
so he's not responsible

511
00:26:57,045 --> 00:27:00,614
for what happened after that.

512
00:27:00,649 --> 00:27:04,018
How else were you supposed to
kick a belligerent drunk out?

513
00:27:04,052 --> 00:27:06,587
Look, you guys,
I know you're trying to help,

514
00:27:06,621 --> 00:27:08,766
but I really don't wanna
Monday morning quarterback this.

515
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,691
I can pay rent
a little earlier this month

516
00:27:10,725 --> 00:27:13,460
- if that helps.
- You know what would help?

517
00:27:13,495 --> 00:27:16,063
If my life weren't
turned upside down at home, too.

518
00:27:16,097 --> 00:27:17,731
- What?
- You can't just come

519
00:27:17,766 --> 00:27:20,234
into somebody's place
and start moving stuff around.

520
00:27:20,268 --> 00:27:23,704
- Hey, now.
- You know, forget it.

521
00:27:23,738 --> 00:27:26,874
My bad. Right? As usual.

522
00:27:26,908 --> 00:27:28,709
Cruz, the screw up.

523
00:27:28,743 --> 00:27:31,078
<i>Squad 3. Car pinned by fallen tree.</i>

524
00:27:31,112 --> 00:27:34,181
<i>84 Andrews.</i>

525
00:27:38,987 --> 00:27:41,155
Branch landed on the car
with the driver inside.

526
00:27:41,189 --> 00:27:43,824
He says he's not hurt,
but the impact jammed the doors.

527
00:27:43,858 --> 00:27:45,826
Okay.

528
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,663
Hey, sir,
can you lower your window more?

529
00:27:49,698 --> 00:27:50,841
You know, I was just
getting ready to head to work,

530
00:27:50,865 --> 00:27:51,999
- and then bam.
- Yeah.

531
00:27:52,033 --> 00:27:53,500
We'll get you out of here.

532
00:27:53,535 --> 00:27:54,912
My landscaper said
the tree had some dry rot,

533
00:27:54,936 --> 00:27:56,247
and my wife said
I should take care of it.

534
00:27:56,271 --> 00:27:57,582
Yeah, I hear ya. Just give us a second.

535
00:27:57,606 --> 00:27:58,806
Okay.

536
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,307
My God.

537
00:28:00,342 --> 00:28:01,976
Um, there's too much weight.

538
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,287
This whole roof's
gonna collapse any second.

539
00:28:03,311 --> 00:28:04,945
Cruz, why don't you grab a blanket

540
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,290
- so we can shield him.
- You got it, Lieutenant.

541
00:28:06,314 --> 00:28:08,582
- Tony, grab a backboard.
- Got it.

542
00:28:14,623 --> 00:28:17,625
Hey! Let's get that backboard!

543
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:20,027
- Coming in!
- Okay! Okay!

544
00:28:20,061 --> 00:28:21,595
Hey, sir, when I pop this window,

545
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,597
- I want you to push yourself out.
- Okay.

546
00:28:23,632 --> 00:28:25,532
Okay.

547
00:28:27,902 --> 00:28:30,838
All right. Here you go.

548
00:28:30,872 --> 00:28:32,840
- We got you.
- You're okay.

549
00:28:35,877 --> 00:28:38,946
My God.

550
00:28:45,987 --> 00:28:48,188
Severide!

551
00:28:48,223 --> 00:28:50,658
Hospital called. It's Anna.

552
00:28:50,692 --> 00:28:52,726
There's been a change. You gotta go.

553
00:28:52,761 --> 00:28:55,062
Go on. Go!

554
00:28:55,096 --> 00:28:57,131
I'll take over.

555
00:29:09,377 --> 00:29:13,047
- Kelly.
- Hey...

556
00:29:13,081 --> 00:29:15,916
- What's going on?
- The infection's taken over.

557
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:19,320
Anna's immune system was
too compromised by the chemo.

558
00:29:19,354 --> 00:29:22,089
Unfortunately, she's septic.

559
00:29:22,123 --> 00:29:24,258
What... What does that mean?

560
00:29:24,292 --> 00:29:27,161
- I'm sorry, Kelly.
- Sorry?

561
00:29:27,195 --> 00:29:29,363
There's nothing more we can do.

562
00:29:29,397 --> 00:29:31,165
We're given her something to

563
00:29:31,199 --> 00:29:33,701
make her comfortable.

564
00:29:33,735 --> 00:29:36,270
If there's anything you have to say,

565
00:29:36,304 --> 00:29:38,272
now is the time.

566
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,678
Okay.

567
00:29:53,421 --> 00:29:56,857
Did you go see her?

568
00:30:00,795 --> 00:30:02,296
What?

569
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:05,799
The lady from the house.

570
00:30:05,834 --> 00:30:07,801
Okay.

571
00:30:13,141 --> 00:30:15,809
Thank you...

572
00:30:15,844 --> 00:30:17,811
for these last few months.

573
00:30:17,846 --> 00:30:20,781
No. No, no, no. Don't do that.

574
00:30:20,815 --> 00:30:23,317
Don't say goodbye.
We're gonna beat this.

575
00:30:23,351 --> 00:30:25,452
Honey.

576
00:30:25,487 --> 00:30:28,122
Hey, we got a miracle once.

577
00:30:28,156 --> 00:30:31,125
We're gonna get another one.

578
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:33,794
Why don't you tell me about her.

579
00:30:33,828 --> 00:30:37,297
Ellie?

580
00:30:40,135 --> 00:30:41,969
You were right.

581
00:30:42,003 --> 00:30:44,138
It wasn't about the house.

582
00:30:44,172 --> 00:30:47,474
It was about her husband, Hal.

583
00:30:47,509 --> 00:30:49,410
You should hear her.

584
00:30:49,444 --> 00:30:50,944
It's,

585
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:53,046
Hal this, Hal that.

586
00:30:55,016 --> 00:30:59,453
They were married for 37 years.

587
00:30:59,487 --> 00:31:01,155
Wow.

588
00:31:01,189 --> 00:31:04,024
Yeah.

589
00:31:04,058 --> 00:31:06,860
That's why she wouldn't leave the house.

590
00:31:06,895 --> 00:31:09,863
All of the memories there.

591
00:31:09,898 --> 00:31:14,301
She can't move with it on her shoulders.

592
00:31:15,904 --> 00:31:17,504
What, babe?

593
00:31:17,539 --> 00:31:21,375
You can't carry a house
on your shoulders.

594
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,216
Hey, just stay right here
and look at me, okay?

595
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,152
I love you.

596
00:31:36,524 --> 00:31:38,792
Carry me.

597
00:31:47,068 --> 00:31:49,470
No. Baby? Baby?

598
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:51,238
Baby, you gotta... you gotta fight.

599
00:31:51,272 --> 00:31:52,306
You gotta fight.

600
00:31:54,175 --> 00:31:56,143
Hey, Anna, you gotta fight.

601
00:31:56,177 --> 00:31:58,846
Honey, don't go.

602
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,247
Don't go.

603
00:32:00,281 --> 00:32:01,982
Hey, you guys, you gotta help her.

604
00:32:02,016 --> 00:32:03,417
You gotta help her.

605
00:32:03,451 --> 00:32:04,518
Hey, guys, okay?

606
00:32:06,554 --> 00:32:09,156
Anna, honey? Honey?

607
00:32:13,928 --> 00:32:15,863
Why aren't you guys helping her?

608
00:32:15,897 --> 00:32:17,764
- Do something!
- We can't.

609
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:19,099
Forget the DNR.

610
00:32:19,133 --> 00:32:20,444
I know her, I know what she wants.

611
00:32:20,468 --> 00:32:21,835
Okay? You're doctors.

612
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,337
You're doctors. Do your job!

613
00:32:23,371 --> 00:32:25,539
- Kelly.
- She wouldn't give up.

614
00:32:25,573 --> 00:32:27,074
- Kelly...
- She wouldn't...

615
00:32:27,108 --> 00:32:29,109
Will you do something?

616
00:32:29,143 --> 00:32:31,545
Time of death 9:21 a.m.

617
00:32:31,579 --> 00:32:33,547
What?

618
00:32:33,581 --> 00:32:37,217
- Anna...
- It's okay, Kelly.

619
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:45,359
It's okay.

620
00:33:32,341 --> 00:33:34,242
Hey, guys, let's clear out.

621
00:33:34,276 --> 00:33:37,512
- Give Severide some space.
- Absolutely.

622
00:33:42,485 --> 00:33:44,219
Call us if...

623
00:34:37,718 --> 00:34:40,119
It's everything from her bulletin board.

624
00:34:44,714 --> 00:34:47,309
Her dad said she'd want you to have it.

625
00:36:01,424 --> 00:36:03,391
You put it all back?

626
00:36:03,426 --> 00:36:05,393
Yeah.

627
00:36:05,428 --> 00:36:08,396
I don't want to
make your life any worse.

628
00:36:08,431 --> 00:36:10,865
I'm almost done packing my stuff.

629
00:36:14,136 --> 00:36:18,740
No. Look, I'm sorry.

630
00:36:18,774 --> 00:36:21,176
I was a jerk.

631
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:23,244
Please don't move out.

632
00:36:31,153 --> 00:36:33,121
Are you sure?

633
00:36:38,461 --> 00:36:41,730
Things get tough, we stick together.

634
00:37:11,193 --> 00:37:13,762
You give a hell of a speech.

635
00:37:13,796 --> 00:37:17,766
You should think about
going into politics.

636
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,267
Yeah, I'll think about it.

637
00:37:23,372 --> 00:37:25,940
I can't go back to 53.

638
00:37:30,212 --> 00:37:32,080
Every time I think about
walking in there

639
00:37:32,114 --> 00:37:33,948
and not seeing those guys...

640
00:37:37,053 --> 00:37:41,489
If that makes me a quitter
in your eyes, then so be it,

641
00:37:41,524 --> 00:37:44,426
but I can't face that house
without them in it.

642
00:37:47,897 --> 00:37:50,165
What if there were a spot
for you at another house?

643
00:37:52,401 --> 00:37:56,037
Specifically, here.

644
00:37:56,072 --> 00:37:59,207
It might take a while to set up, but...

645
00:37:59,241 --> 00:38:01,209
When I made it back,

646
00:38:01,243 --> 00:38:04,112
I did it because
of the people in this house.

647
00:38:06,415 --> 00:38:08,950
Jason, it's gotta come from you.

648
00:38:08,984 --> 00:38:10,985
You gotta want it.

649
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:16,324
But I know if there's a way back
from where you are right now...

650
00:38:18,411 --> 00:38:20,479
It's through this house.

651
00:38:31,273 --> 00:38:33,341
What now?

652
00:38:39,949 --> 00:38:41,349
Where are you going?

653
00:38:46,355 --> 00:38:48,857
What the hell are you doing?

654
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,995
You can't stay here.

655
00:38:55,297 --> 00:38:58,867
But you can take this with you anywhere.

656
00:38:58,901 --> 00:39:00,268
That way...

657
00:39:00,302 --> 00:39:02,370
you'll always carry him with you.

658
00:39:09,979 --> 00:39:12,046
My girlfriend died.

659
00:39:17,486 --> 00:39:20,021
I'm so sorry.

660
00:39:24,493 --> 00:39:26,461
I'm so sorry.

661
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:39,035
Will you help me pack?

662
00:39:42,432 --> 00:39:43,988
Yes.

663
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:42,560

1
00:00:00,805 --> 00:00:04,040
- Hey. You okay?
- I love Chicago,

2
00:00:04,042 --> 00:00:05,041
<i>being with you.</i>

3
00:00:05,043 --> 00:00:07,043
I guess I just miss my people.

4
00:00:07,045 --> 00:00:08,277
I wish I could help.

5
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:10,847
Kelly, you barely know this woman.

6
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:13,783
Lately I've been staring
in the mirror a lot,

7
00:00:13,785 --> 00:00:16,219
<i>and the person looking back
looks more and more like Benny.</i>

8
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:18,388
I don't want that future.

9
00:00:21,258 --> 00:00:24,576
So, tell me about this little project.

10
00:00:24,729 --> 00:00:26,262
The damper's stuck.

11
00:00:26,264 --> 00:00:29,232
So, indoor camping ain't happening?

12
00:00:29,234 --> 00:00:30,900
Stop.

13
00:00:30,902 --> 00:00:32,769
Not unless I bring home
a couple respirators.

14
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:34,837
Oh, that's so romantic.

15
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:38,274
Hey, there's these log cabin
rentals out in Galena.

16
00:00:38,276 --> 00:00:40,076
It's about two hours away.

17
00:00:40,078 --> 00:00:42,078
Lots of hiking if the weather's good.

18
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,680
Logs on the fire if not.

19
00:00:43,682 --> 00:00:45,615
No respirators needed.

20
00:00:45,617 --> 00:00:47,766
How many girls have you taken there?

21
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,754
A whole lot.

22
00:00:51,756 --> 00:00:54,991
None! You think I'd reuse
some old game on you?

23
00:00:54,993 --> 00:00:56,325
- Yeah, okay.
- Stop it.

24
00:00:56,327 --> 00:00:58,294
For now I'm gonna choose to believe you.

25
00:01:00,265 --> 00:01:01,857
Hello?

26
00:01:03,513 --> 00:01:05,713
Hey, Trudy. Yeah. What's up?

27
00:01:17,986 --> 00:01:19,963
What did he do?

28
00:01:21,186 --> 00:01:24,587
He got into a "you should see
the other guy" situation

29
00:01:24,589 --> 00:01:27,180
with three off-duty cops on Rush Street.

30
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:30,670
- You should see the other guys.
- They're not pressing charges.

31
00:01:30,695 --> 00:01:33,196
- So, he's free to go?
- To be your problem, yeah.

32
00:01:33,198 --> 00:01:36,999
Benny, next time
I'm not calling your son.

33
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:38,634
Thanks, Trudy.

34
00:01:38,636 --> 00:01:40,737
I'm sorry I threw up
in the holding cell.

35
00:01:47,177 --> 00:01:49,112
Hi, Kelly.

36
00:01:52,616 --> 00:01:55,213
Get this: we got a trainee today.

37
00:01:55,564 --> 00:01:57,508
Someone must have screwed up
the paperwork

38
00:01:57,533 --> 00:01:59,722
to let you loose on an
impressionable young mind.

39
00:01:59,724 --> 00:02:02,625
I'm sure they're
hoping Brett makes up for me.

40
00:02:02,627 --> 00:02:04,827
And I'll handle the Dawson
put-downs, thank you very much.

41
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:07,524
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'm driving.

42
00:02:07,832 --> 00:02:09,198
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

43
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,573
How's this while you're driving?

44
00:02:14,906 --> 00:02:16,948
- Ah. Whoa.
- What?

45
00:02:17,075 --> 00:02:20,243
Is that a crack house?
In this neighborhood?

46
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,171
I doubt they're selling
Girl Scout Cookies.

47
00:02:32,656 --> 00:02:36,259
Gabriela Dawson, Sylvie Brett.
This is...

48
00:02:36,261 --> 00:02:37,727
Harris Thornton.

49
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:39,362
Your trainee for the day.

50
00:02:39,364 --> 00:02:40,897
Great to have you with us, Harris.

51
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:42,298
We'll take good care of him, Chief.

52
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,516
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

53
00:02:45,848 --> 00:02:49,116
So, you are to observe only.
That means you don't

54
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:51,419
touch anyone, you don't
hand out medical advice.

55
00:02:51,444 --> 00:02:52,708
You just stand to the side.

56
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,878
You let these very capable
ladies tell you what to do.

57
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,631
Thank you, Chief Boden.

58
00:02:58,752 --> 00:03:01,127
So, where you from?

59
00:03:01,152 --> 00:03:02,885
Oh, good lord.

60
00:03:02,887 --> 00:03:04,887
- Wallace.
- Benny.

61
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:06,270
What's the occasion?

62
00:03:06,272 --> 00:03:07,934
Just a harmless Chicago weekend.

63
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:09,823
Yeah.

64
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:12,605
- Good to see you, Benny.
- Okay.

65
00:03:13,988 --> 00:03:15,220
Morning, fellas.

66
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:16,566
- Hey, Benny!
- Benny!

67
00:03:16,568 --> 00:03:18,421
Hey, man. It's been a while.

68
00:03:18,446 --> 00:03:20,968
- Just picked him up from jail.
- I was defending the honor

69
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,913
of a very, very nice young woman.

70
00:03:22,938 --> 00:03:24,340
- I thought you were married.
- Was.

71
00:03:24,342 --> 00:03:27,046
Yeah, what he said.
I hope you guys don't mind

72
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:29,171
if I hang out at 51 for a little while.

73
00:03:29,196 --> 00:03:32,048
I'm... I just want
to catch a couple of Zs.

74
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,226
Ah, that's fine.

75
00:03:35,253 --> 00:03:38,724
<i>Truck 81, Squad 3, Ambulance 61.</i>

76
00:03:38,749 --> 00:03:41,224
Person trapped. 67 South Hoyne.

77
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:46,560
Vonn, the cleaning guy,
he comes in before we open

78
00:03:46,585 --> 00:03:48,212
and gets everything situated,
but he didn't answer

79
00:03:48,237 --> 00:03:49,562
when I called out to him today.

80
00:03:51,602 --> 00:03:53,701
The hinges on this thing are
always swinging the door shut.

81
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:55,224
You're supposed to be able
to open it from the inside,

82
00:03:55,249 --> 00:03:56,900
but the latch has been acting up.

83
00:03:56,925 --> 00:03:59,675
- How long has he been in there?
- Not sure. Couple of hours.

84
00:04:05,168 --> 00:04:09,814

85
00:04:13,463 --> 00:04:15,128
Hermann, Otis, get the jaws.

86
00:04:15,152 --> 00:04:16,300
- Hey, Tony and Capp,
- Yeah?

87
00:04:16,302 --> 00:04:17,769
get behind the building,
check the compressor

88
00:04:17,777 --> 00:04:20,077
or the condenser, see if we can
get quicker access.

89
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,712
Hey, Vonn, can you hear us?

90
00:04:21,714 --> 00:04:24,474
Make a noise or wiggle
your fingers if you can.

91
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:26,150
Well, if he's alive,

92
00:04:26,152 --> 00:04:28,085
he probably has hypothermia
or frostbite.

93
00:04:28,087 --> 00:04:29,420
I'll get blankets and warm fluids.

94
00:04:29,422 --> 00:04:31,159
Okay, let's move.

95
00:04:31,324 --> 00:04:33,958
Casey, I think these hinges
might be a weak point.

96
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,993
I say we cut them,
pry it open from here.

97
00:04:35,995 --> 00:04:37,461
- Yeah.
- What about his fingers?

98
00:04:37,463 --> 00:04:39,430
We push this side out,
they're gonna snap off.

99
00:04:39,432 --> 00:04:41,399
I'd rather save his life
than save his fingers.

100
00:04:41,401 --> 00:04:43,200
<i>No access back here, Lieutenant.</i>

101
00:04:43,202 --> 00:04:45,503
Hey, Capp, check the roof.

102
00:04:45,505 --> 00:04:47,744
The condenser and the evaporator...

103
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:49,273
it's got to be up there somewhere.

104
00:04:49,275 --> 00:04:51,902
<i>- Copy.
- All right, let's do it.</i>

105
00:04:52,612 --> 00:04:54,412
Hey... hey, wait, wait, wait.

106
00:04:54,414 --> 00:04:57,114
What if we put two Halligans
above and below his fingers

107
00:04:57,116 --> 00:04:58,949
to preserve the gap,
and then we pop the door

108
00:04:58,951 --> 00:05:01,052
on the hinge side, comes this way?

109
00:05:01,054 --> 00:05:02,987
Yeah. Yeah, good idea.

110
00:05:20,206 --> 00:05:22,239
- Tell us when.
- Okay. Ready?

111
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:23,908
And... now!

112
00:05:33,953 --> 00:05:36,053
There's a pulse!

113
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,293
Let's get him on the stretcher.

114
00:05:45,531 --> 00:05:48,933
- I'll deal with his fingers en route.
- One, two, three.

115
00:05:51,555 --> 00:05:52,798
Okay.

116
00:05:52,823 --> 00:05:54,245
Thornton.

117
00:05:54,768 --> 00:05:57,112
Hey. Let's move.

118
00:05:57,343 --> 00:05:59,252
Yeah.

119
00:06:11,356 --> 00:06:13,290
Otis, take a left here.

120
00:06:18,597 --> 00:06:20,264
What's up, Lieutenant?

121
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:22,952
I want to check out the new neighbors.

122
00:06:23,202 --> 00:06:25,102
That's the house.

123
00:06:28,573 --> 00:06:30,483
Whoa, whoa, hold up.

124
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:33,110
See that?

125
00:06:39,151 --> 00:06:41,652
- What you got?
- Get inside.

126
00:06:43,482 --> 00:06:44,779
There's a kid in here.

127
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,693
I'm popping the window.

128
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:57,067
Hey, there, big fella.

129
00:06:57,218 --> 00:06:58,518
Nothing to be afraid of.

130
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,043
My window!

131
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,979
You leave your kid in the car?

132
00:07:03,004 --> 00:07:05,188
I was in there for less than
five minutes trying to...

133
00:07:05,213 --> 00:07:07,213
you know what, I don't need
to explain myself to you guys.

134
00:07:07,238 --> 00:07:08,340
Forget it.

135
00:07:08,365 --> 00:07:10,574
- Wow.
- Yeah.

136
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:26,312
Hey. Got the license plate.

137
00:07:42,178 --> 00:07:43,347
Oh.

138
00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:46,310
Ah, it's okay, Lieutenant.
What can I do you for?

139
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:49,248
Uh, well, there's a crack house

140
00:07:49,273 --> 00:07:51,005
that's popped up over on Southwood.

141
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,440
On our way back,
we saw a car parked there

142
00:07:53,442 --> 00:07:54,908
with a toddler in the back.

143
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,038
I punched the window,
but this woman exited

144
00:07:57,063 --> 00:07:59,513
and drove off
before we could do anything.

145
00:07:59,515 --> 00:08:00,881
Okay. What are you not telling me?

146
00:08:00,883 --> 00:08:03,684
Well, the woman looked normal. A mom.

147
00:08:03,686 --> 00:08:07,521
The kid appeared scared,
but healthy and well-dressed.

148
00:08:07,523 --> 00:08:10,224
The car was a new BMW,
and we got the license plate,

149
00:08:10,226 --> 00:08:13,227
but she didn't look like a user.

150
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:16,180
- Users come in all shapes and sizes.
- No... I know.

151
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,477
You know, back in the day, we used to

152
00:08:17,502 --> 00:08:19,781
handle drug houses in
a whole 'nother way:

153
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:22,503
light a match, keep the hoses dry.

154
00:08:22,505 --> 00:08:24,527
Benny.

155
00:08:24,907 --> 00:08:28,408
Look, I'll tell you what:
I'll make a call over to CPD

156
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,949
and get an address for your SUV.

157
00:08:29,996 --> 00:08:32,145
Or that.

158
00:08:32,147 --> 00:08:34,581
All right. Thanks, Chief. Appreciate it.

159
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,517
Yeah, you're welcome.

160
00:08:40,188 --> 00:08:42,477
Honey, what's up?

161
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:45,301
Your son is getting suspended.

162
00:08:48,163 --> 00:08:50,464
I'm sorry. Come again?

163
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:54,508
Lee Henry wouldn't say the pledge
of allegiance at school today.

164
00:08:54,603 --> 00:08:56,397
- What?
- What I said.

165
00:08:56,422 --> 00:08:59,640
Apparently he decided
to take a knee instead.

166
00:08:59,642 --> 00:09:01,441
I got a call from the vice principal,

167
00:09:01,443 --> 00:09:03,873
and they said to come pick him up.

168
00:09:03,898 --> 00:09:07,430
Please drop him off here

169
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,110
after you go get him.

170
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,556
What is this world coming to?

171
00:09:19,242 --> 00:09:23,597
- What... what was that about?
- America, the not-so-beautiful.

172
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:28,268
Oh, hey, Brett,
how's the freezer victim?

173
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,137
Conscious! Yeah, they're
working on his hand.

174
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:31,489
They think they have a chance
of saving it.

175
00:09:31,514 --> 00:09:32,839
Nice, Joe!

176
00:09:33,452 --> 00:09:35,446
Rule number one: every successful run

177
00:09:35,471 --> 00:09:37,471
ends with junk food... come on.

178
00:09:46,287 --> 00:09:47,654
Ladyfinger?

179
00:09:50,435 --> 00:09:53,403
Rule number two: take this job
seriously when you have to,

180
00:09:53,428 --> 00:09:55,356
and that's it,
otherwise you won't last a year.

181
00:09:57,041 --> 00:10:00,167
I got to tell you: I thought I was gonna
toss my breakfast back there.

182
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:02,436
Ugh, every new paramedic's
worst nightmare.

183
00:10:02,438 --> 00:10:04,338
- Is it?
- Of course it is.

184
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,207
My mom and dad... they told me
I wasn't cut out for this.

185
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:08,642
They told me I wouldn't last a week.

186
00:10:08,644 --> 00:10:10,277
Aww.

187
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:13,246
"Supportive" isn't a word you'll hear
at the Thornton house.

188
00:10:13,248 --> 00:10:15,032
So, why are you here?

189
00:10:15,317 --> 00:10:17,298
I was in a bicycle accident
when I was 12.

190
00:10:17,597 --> 00:10:19,595
These paramedics showed up, and...

191
00:10:19,746 --> 00:10:22,142
I'm not sure if I'd be able to
walk if it wasn't for them.

192
00:10:22,391 --> 00:10:23,857
I said to myself,
"This is what I'm gonna do."

193
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,627
Well, you're gonna be a good one.
I can already tell.

194
00:10:28,191 --> 00:10:31,231
<i>Ambulance 61.
Man down from unknown causes.</i>

195
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:32,666
It's that kind of day.

196
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:45,612
Thank you.

197
00:10:49,652 --> 00:10:52,486
61 to main, we're gonna need
two more ambulances.

198
00:10:52,488 --> 00:10:54,421
<i>Copy, 61.</i>

199
00:10:56,825 --> 00:10:58,925
Where are the employees?

200
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,929
Hello? Anyone here?

201
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:11,519
You check behind the counter.

202
00:11:13,896 --> 00:11:15,629
God, what are we dealing with here?

203
00:11:18,966 --> 00:11:20,901
I got another one!

204
00:11:24,772 --> 00:11:26,669
And a can of oven cleaner.

205
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,909
If he sprayed the oven
and didn't wipe it up,

206
00:11:29,005 --> 00:11:30,819
couldn't that cause cyanide poisoning?

207
00:11:30,882 --> 00:11:32,913
I'll get the Cyanokit.

208
00:11:38,988 --> 00:11:40,889
He's having a heart attack!

209
00:11:44,693 --> 00:11:46,293
What are you doing, Harris?

210
00:11:46,295 --> 00:11:48,482
- He's not responding!
- I said, "What are you doing?"

211
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,611
- Chest compressions.
- Harris, no. Stop!

212
00:11:50,636 --> 00:11:51,698
14, 15, 16...

213
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,846
Oh, God.

214
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,623
- I think I cracked a rib.
- Get back.

215
00:12:00,046 --> 00:12:02,047
Pulse is okay.

216
00:12:03,945 --> 00:12:05,145
Dawson?

217
00:12:05,147 --> 00:12:06,513
Yeah. Back here. Bring the kit.

218
00:12:06,515 --> 00:12:07,721
- These two.
- Got 'em.

219
00:12:07,746 --> 00:12:09,816
You take this one, I'll take her.

220
00:12:11,553 --> 00:12:13,720
He cracked a rib doing compressions.

221
00:12:14,011 --> 00:12:16,727
What part of "observe only"
did you not understand?

222
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:39,622
- Stupid kid.
- What would you have done?

223
00:12:39,815 --> 00:12:41,748
The exact same thing.

224
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:49,845
Hey.

225
00:12:50,058 --> 00:12:52,559
Alvin. Thanks for coming.

226
00:12:52,561 --> 00:12:55,095
Your chief called over.
Something about a drug house?

227
00:12:55,097 --> 00:12:57,831
Yeah. Right around the corner
on Southwood. Can't miss it.

228
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,112
You see any weapons around or
anybody shooting up in public?

229
00:13:00,137 --> 00:13:02,535
Nope, but a lot of junkies
coming and going.

230
00:13:02,723 --> 00:13:06,106
All right. Just trying
to get the feel for the urgency.

231
00:13:06,108 --> 00:13:08,282
- It's urgent.
- All right.

232
00:13:08,307 --> 00:13:10,306
I'll talk to Narcotics,
see if they can look into it.

233
00:13:12,114 --> 00:13:14,876
Oh, he's also got me
checking into a license plate.

234
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,781
Yeah. There was a car out front,
looked completely out of place.

235
00:13:17,806 --> 00:13:20,086
All right. Listen, I got to go.

236
00:13:20,314 --> 00:13:22,885
I'll text the registration
address as soon as I get it.

237
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,394
- Copy that. Thanks, man.
- Okay.

238
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:46,008
You help me understand this, Lee Henry.

239
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,092
They raised the prices
on the vending machines,

240
00:13:48,117 --> 00:13:50,108
and I'm free to express
my First Amendment rights

241
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:52,484
however I want, just like pro athletes.

242
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,940
Pro athletes?

243
00:13:54,942 --> 00:13:57,743
The whole point of America is
that I have the right to protest

244
00:13:57,745 --> 00:14:00,979
and not say the pledge of allegiance
if I don't want to.

245
00:14:00,981 --> 00:14:06,184
You are a Hermann
before you are an American,

246
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:10,789
which means I tell you
what your rights are!

247
00:14:12,692 --> 00:14:17,272
Hermanns do not defile the sacred things

248
00:14:17,297 --> 00:14:20,014
which I hold most dear in my heart,

249
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:23,602
like love of country, love of freedom,

250
00:14:23,604 --> 00:14:26,459
and love of all the things
in history books

251
00:14:26,484 --> 00:14:31,813
which tell us that this is
the greatest country on Earth!

252
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:35,781
Yeah, Beth booted me out
about six months ago.

253
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:37,795
I thought about trying
to "aw shucks" my way

254
00:14:37,797 --> 00:14:39,430
back into her good graces, but then...

255
00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:42,506
then I just thought, "Why bother?"

256
00:14:42,975 --> 00:14:46,270
- Because you're married?
- Yeah, well, I gave it a shot.

257
00:14:46,357 --> 00:14:49,239
Didn't work out. No shame in that.

258
00:14:49,475 --> 00:14:51,036
Okay.

259
00:14:51,144 --> 00:14:54,045
Speaking of things not working out,
I had you all set up in Springfield,

260
00:14:54,047 --> 00:14:55,707
and then I get a call
you turned it down.

261
00:14:55,732 --> 00:14:57,248
- That's right.
- They were gonna give you

262
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,416
your own battalion.

263
00:14:58,418 --> 00:15:01,152
My loyalty is to Chicago.

264
00:15:02,688 --> 00:15:04,335
What's her name?

265
00:15:05,425 --> 00:15:06,924
What?

266
00:15:06,984 --> 00:15:08,820
You're just like me,

267
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:10,933
stubbing your toe for a woman.

268
00:15:11,005 --> 00:15:12,538
That's not like you.

269
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:14,010
But yes, there's a woman.

270
00:15:14,035 --> 00:15:15,967
- Aha! I knew it.
- Not like you.

271
00:15:15,969 --> 00:15:18,236
The hell you aren't.
I got to meet this girl

272
00:15:18,238 --> 00:15:20,071
who's got my son's head spinning.

273
00:15:20,073 --> 00:15:22,354
- Dinner. Friday night.
- Eh, I don't know.

274
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,979
I do know. We're gonna do this.

275
00:15:24,004 --> 00:15:26,151
Steaks on me.
She's not a vegetarian, is she?

276
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:27,878
- She's not. No.
- Okay, good.

277
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,806
Then it's done.

278
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,994
How old was the kid?

279
00:15:35,421 --> 00:15:37,518
Bigger than Louie.

280
00:15:39,658 --> 00:15:40,996
And the mom was using?

281
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,924
I don't know why else she'd be there.

282
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,122
And she was more worried
about getting out of there

283
00:15:45,147 --> 00:15:47,446
than her broken window.

284
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,929
I just can't get the image
of that kid out of my head.

285
00:15:51,104 --> 00:15:53,835
Then you have to do something
about it, baby.

286
00:15:54,515 --> 00:15:56,374
Hey.

287
00:15:56,376 --> 00:15:58,412
Got some good news,
and I got some bad news.

288
00:15:58,437 --> 00:16:00,645
Good news is I got the address for you.

289
00:16:00,647 --> 00:16:01,646
Toddler incident.

290
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:03,789
Bucktown?

291
00:16:03,908 --> 00:16:05,336
That's just where the car is registered.

292
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:07,517
She drives all the way here for drugs?

293
00:16:08,421 --> 00:16:11,722
Look, if you're gonna check
her out, do it off shift.

294
00:16:11,724 --> 00:16:15,466
Understood. What's the bad news?

295
00:16:16,728 --> 00:16:20,350
Chief Hatcher is here
to talk to you and Brett.

296
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,868
Something you want to tell me
about your last call?

297
00:16:27,906 --> 00:16:31,008
It's my understanding that
our trainee Harris Thornton here

298
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:34,922
attempted CPR on a poison victim
and cracked his rib.

299
00:16:34,947 --> 00:16:36,881
Is that accurate?

300
00:16:37,014 --> 00:16:38,549
Because if it is, I have no choice

301
00:16:38,574 --> 00:16:41,003
but to dismiss you
from our training program.

302
00:16:42,355 --> 00:16:44,055
What?

303
00:16:44,152 --> 00:16:46,123
He's out of the CFD. That's our rules.

304
00:16:46,124 --> 00:16:48,727
It was my order, sir.

305
00:16:49,228 --> 00:16:50,906
What do you mean, "my order"?

306
00:16:51,297 --> 00:16:54,031
I told Harris to start CPR.
We had multiple victims

307
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:55,700
suffering from cyanide poisoning

308
00:16:55,702 --> 00:16:57,530
when the cook went into cardiac arrest.

309
00:16:57,555 --> 00:17:00,037
- So, you saw this?
- I did.

310
00:17:04,744 --> 00:17:07,135
You knew you were supposed
to observe only, correct?

311
00:17:07,647 --> 00:17:11,816
That's true, but it was both
our call to have him assist.

312
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:13,113
Dawson and me, both.

313
00:17:13,138 --> 00:17:17,265
We, like she said, had multiple victims
and not enough hands.

314
00:17:17,443 --> 00:17:19,790
Was he not supposed to take our order?

315
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:22,086
On top of that, our trainee is the one

316
00:17:22,111 --> 00:17:23,751
who realized it was cyanide poisoning.

317
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,336
There was a can of oven cleaner
sitting on the counter,

318
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:28,165
which he found and identified.

319
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:29,703
We didn't know
what we were dealing with,

320
00:17:29,824 --> 00:17:32,859
and Harris figured it out, sir... Chief.

321
00:17:38,877 --> 00:17:40,990
If they say it's true, it's true.

322
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,019
I want an incident case report.

323
00:17:49,092 --> 00:17:51,055
- Yes, Chief.
- You got it.

324
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:10,625
I appreciate you both
standing up for me,

325
00:18:10,641 --> 00:18:12,374
but if I'm liable
for the broken rib, then...

326
00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:13,482
No way.

327
00:18:13,484 --> 00:18:15,029
We've spent years in the union.

328
00:18:15,054 --> 00:18:18,109
I mean, we might get another
ding on our magical files,

329
00:18:18,111 --> 00:18:20,378
but you've got your whole future
ahead of you.

330
00:18:20,403 --> 00:18:21,977
Yeah. You were just trying
to do the right thing.

331
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:24,472
Rule number three: save lives first...

332
00:18:24,474 --> 00:18:26,307
worry about consequences later.

333
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:29,544
Okay. Thank you. Both of you.

334
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:31,946
I promise to live up
to your expectations.

335
00:18:31,971 --> 00:18:33,393
Just live up to yours.

336
00:18:33,418 --> 00:18:35,216
Yeah, we still have you
for one more shift, right?

337
00:18:35,218 --> 00:18:37,041
Yes.

338
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:39,245
See you Thursday.

339
00:18:40,155 --> 00:18:42,223
<i>- Oh, really?
- Yeah.</i>

340
00:18:42,225 --> 00:18:44,092
What's your plan with Lee Henry?

341
00:18:44,094 --> 00:18:46,183
Well, Cindy and I...
we got a meeting scheduled

342
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,829
with the vice principal,
and we're gonna,

343
00:18:47,831 --> 00:18:50,264
you know, discuss numbnuts' protest.

344
00:18:50,266 --> 00:18:52,266
- What are you gonna say?
- I don't know.

345
00:18:52,268 --> 00:18:54,509
It's a family matter,
and I'm gonna take care of it.

346
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:56,063
That's good. Yeah.

347
00:18:56,088 --> 00:18:58,345
- That's good.
- What?

348
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:02,964
Sometimes you let your
emotions get the best of you.

349
00:19:03,396 --> 00:19:05,829
Maybe this time you listen
more than you speak.

350
00:19:05,831 --> 00:19:07,831
Vice principal probably
just wants to be heard.

351
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,939
That's good advice, friend.

352
00:19:16,427 --> 00:19:18,261
Donuts.

353
00:19:18,344 --> 00:19:20,945
- What?
- My advice is bring donuts.

354
00:19:21,777 --> 00:19:23,714
That's your advice for everything.

355
00:19:23,716 --> 00:19:26,363
Yeah. Because it works.

356
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:28,786
True that.

357
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:34,358
Ah, Christopher, Cindy, come on in.

358
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,127
We got you pastries from Dinkel's.

359
00:19:37,129 --> 00:19:39,163
- Thank you.
- It was nothing.

360
00:19:39,165 --> 00:19:40,831
- On our way here.
- Oh.

361
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,367
We appreciate you calling us down here.

362
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:47,037
It gives us the opportunity
to fully apologize

363
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:48,872
on behalf of Lee Henry.

364
00:19:48,874 --> 00:19:50,609
Well, you should be apologizing

365
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,242
to everyone in the school.

366
00:19:52,244 --> 00:19:54,845
We have no tolerance for hate speech.

367
00:19:54,847 --> 00:19:56,981
Hate speech? I mean, he was just upset

368
00:19:56,983 --> 00:19:59,383
about the vending machines.

369
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,885
Okay, yeah. No. Yes.

370
00:20:01,887 --> 00:20:05,089
Uh, he understands the
seriousness of his actions, so...

371
00:20:05,091 --> 00:20:06,256
- Good.
- Yeah.

372
00:20:06,258 --> 00:20:08,156
Because let me tell you what I see.

373
00:20:08,327 --> 00:20:11,228
See, parents these days are
real quick to point fingers

374
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:14,331
everywhere else except at themselves.

375
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,799
Now, I assure you

376
00:20:15,801 --> 00:20:19,236
Lee Henry learned this
inflammatory behavior

377
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:21,171
by being exposed to it

378
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:24,389
either directly or indirectly at home.

379
00:20:24,977 --> 00:20:27,006
Excuse me?

380
00:20:27,813 --> 00:20:30,414
Hey, no, no, Cindy.
He's calling us failures

381
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:34,284
when our son was just exercising
his constitutional rights.

382
00:20:34,286 --> 00:20:37,354
In fact, that's the whole point
of America,

383
00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:39,056
is that our son has the right

384
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:42,426
to not say the pledge of allegiance
if he doesn't want to.

385
00:20:42,428 --> 00:20:44,261
Mr. Hermann, will you just...
I suggest you just...

386
00:20:44,263 --> 00:20:45,796
No. You know what I suggest?

387
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:49,166
That you remember that this is America!

388
00:20:49,168 --> 00:20:51,001
And the Hermann family has something

389
00:20:51,003 --> 00:20:52,589
called the First Amendment,

390
00:20:52,614 --> 00:20:55,339
which protects us from bullies like you

391
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:57,574
coming in here, "Oh, hate speech"!

392
00:20:58,404 --> 00:21:00,191
I don't know how long
he's gonna be in town,

393
00:21:00,216 --> 00:21:02,582
but I think we have
to reschedule our cabin getaway.

394
00:21:02,607 --> 00:21:05,555
- Yeah. No worries.
- Because...

395
00:21:05,951 --> 00:21:07,898
he wants to take us out to dinner.

396
00:21:09,155 --> 00:21:10,820
Really?

397
00:21:11,892 --> 00:21:14,092
- That's great.
- Yeah?

398
00:21:14,117 --> 00:21:16,325
Yes. My God,
I want to meet the old block

399
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,551
who created this chip.

400
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,154
- Well, prepare to be disappointed.
- Why?

401
00:21:20,466 --> 00:21:22,062
I don't know. Benny and me...

402
00:21:22,201 --> 00:21:24,265
we don't have that much in common.

403
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,170
In fact, every choice I've made
has been based

404
00:21:26,195 --> 00:21:28,048
on doing the opposite
of what he would do.

405
00:21:28,073 --> 00:21:31,231
- Except for fire fighting.
- That one I can't explain.

406
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:33,900
I'll take an egg sandwich
on an egg bagel

407
00:21:33,902 --> 00:21:36,002
and a coffee, please.

408
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,470
That sounds good. I'll have that, too.

409
00:21:37,472 --> 00:21:40,041
- Pick up on your left.
- Thank you. Keep it.

410
00:21:41,043 --> 00:21:44,144
So, 8:00 p.m.? Friday night?

411
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:46,613
Well, I... I have to work Friday,

412
00:21:46,699 --> 00:21:48,281
so as soon as I get off shift.

413
00:21:48,283 --> 00:21:50,848
You know, I might be ten or so late.

414
00:21:50,873 --> 00:21:52,619
By all means,
take as much time as you can.

415
00:21:52,621 --> 00:21:54,454
Five minutes before dessert.
That's fine with me.

416
00:21:54,456 --> 00:21:56,623
No. Forget that.
I'm ordering a bone-in ribeye,

417
00:21:56,625 --> 00:22:00,254
and I'm gonna learn
all about Kelly Severide.

418
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:02,362
That's what I'm afraid of.

419
00:22:30,324 --> 00:22:33,212
- Hello, there.
- Hello.

420
00:22:33,362 --> 00:22:37,413
Say, do you know the Sullivans
across the street?

421
00:22:37,499 --> 00:22:40,033
Know of them. My mother always said,

422
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:42,502
"Be friendly with your neighbors,
but don't be friends with them."

423
00:22:42,504 --> 00:22:45,544
Well, are they...

424
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:49,009
is there anything weird going on there?

425
00:22:49,011 --> 00:22:50,911
Besides the fact that
the police have been over there

426
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:53,179
three times in the last year?

427
00:22:53,181 --> 00:22:54,481
Really?

428
00:22:54,483 --> 00:22:56,707
What's this all about, anyway?

429
00:22:57,286 --> 00:23:00,320
Just a concerned citizen.
Thanks for your help.

430
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,783
- Yes?
- Hi.

431
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:23,752
My name's Matt Casey. I'm a firefighter.

432
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:25,722
I work on the other side of town.

433
00:23:26,915 --> 00:23:28,548
Yeah, what is it?

434
00:23:28,636 --> 00:23:31,217
Well, I was, um, wondering if
I could have a word with your...

435
00:23:31,219 --> 00:23:33,018
Oh, my God. Is she dead?

436
00:23:38,972 --> 00:23:42,507
Our daughter Chelsea.
She's 18 years old.

437
00:23:42,509 --> 00:23:43,816
Which makes her an adult.

438
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:46,139
And she's there, in that house.

439
00:23:46,313 --> 00:23:48,597
Probably using. She has before.

440
00:23:48,622 --> 00:23:50,699
It's my fault. I kicked her out.

441
00:23:51,462 --> 00:23:53,902
- I didn't mean what I said.
- I know you didn't.

442
00:23:55,707 --> 00:23:58,795
It's taken everything I have
not to go down to that house

443
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,953
with a gun in my hand.

444
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,436
Why didn't you call the police?

445
00:24:02,438 --> 00:24:04,418
We did. Last year.

446
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,114
They arrested Chelsea for dealing.

447
00:24:07,343 --> 00:24:10,311
She was a minor then,
so she got probation.

448
00:24:10,313 --> 00:24:12,505
Now she'd get jail time.
Serious jail time.

449
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,859
We tried to explain to the
court that she's the victim,

450
00:24:14,884 --> 00:24:17,017
but she was in possession of enough...

451
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:18,575
We don't know what to do.

452
00:24:24,793 --> 00:24:28,028
I know that I shouldn't have gone there.

453
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,430
Not with Nolan in the car.

454
00:24:29,432 --> 00:24:32,654
But it just came over me that I...

455
00:24:34,937 --> 00:24:37,055
I had to try something.

456
00:24:37,273 --> 00:24:38,939
You know, it overwhelmed me.

457
00:24:38,941 --> 00:24:42,943
This man...
this Rijo or Rojo or something...

458
00:24:43,376 --> 00:24:46,123
it's like he has a spell over her.

459
00:24:46,148 --> 00:24:48,015
I mean, the other day,
she wouldn't even see me,

460
00:24:48,017 --> 00:24:50,910
and he told me that he would
kill me if I ever came back.

461
00:24:51,488 --> 00:24:54,020
We've lost our child, Mr. Casey.

462
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:57,850
We had her in our arms, and then...

463
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,960
something snatched her away.

464
00:25:02,397 --> 00:25:05,065
I know the feeling, Mr. Sullivan.

465
00:25:08,303 --> 00:25:10,763
I know that she'll listen to me

466
00:25:11,207 --> 00:25:14,841
if I can just see her.

467
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:20,114
Let me, um...
let me talk to some people,

468
00:25:20,222 --> 00:25:22,082
see if there's another route
we can take.

469
00:25:22,175 --> 00:25:24,128
Just please don't call the police.

470
00:25:24,198 --> 00:25:30,357
- If she goes to jail...
- I understand. Just give me a day.

471
00:25:35,807 --> 00:25:38,138
Nah, it was just as I expected.

472
00:25:38,301 --> 00:25:41,035
Hey. Lee Henry still alive?

473
00:25:41,037 --> 00:25:42,430
Or do we need to send a search party out

474
00:25:42,455 --> 00:25:44,048
to the woods behind your house?

475
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:48,835
Oh, Lee Henry is actually
a really smart kid.

476
00:25:48,944 --> 00:25:52,803
He's stupid as hell, but he's smart.

477
00:25:54,884 --> 00:25:57,918
Did... did he hear what he said?

478
00:26:10,897 --> 00:26:12,731
- Matt.
- Alvin.

479
00:26:12,756 --> 00:26:14,126
- Hey.
- Was just gonna call you.

480
00:26:14,151 --> 00:26:15,069
I got some news for you.

481
00:26:15,094 --> 00:26:16,563
I spoke to my buddy in Narcotics,

482
00:26:16,588 --> 00:26:18,849
and they're aware
of the Southwood house.

483
00:26:18,874 --> 00:26:21,838
In fact, they're raiding
the place in two days.

484
00:26:22,044 --> 00:26:24,111
And everyone inside gets arrested?

485
00:26:24,113 --> 00:26:26,034
That's the idea, yeah.

486
00:26:27,534 --> 00:26:29,954
You got to call it off, Al.

487
00:26:29,979 --> 00:26:31,719
It's not mine to call off, Matt.

488
00:26:31,721 --> 00:26:33,655
The machinery's already in motion.

489
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,061
Isn't that why you called me
in the first place?

490
00:26:35,086 --> 00:26:37,188
Yeah, there's a girl inside, okay?

491
00:26:37,213 --> 00:26:41,344
She's a teenager.
She's just a kid who needs help.

492
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,117
A girl, huh?

493
00:26:43,555 --> 00:26:46,016
She doesn't deserve
to get caught up in all this.

494
00:26:48,806 --> 00:26:52,171
Well, I'll talk to my guy,
but Narcotics is geared up

495
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:54,890
for a bust... it's hard to put
the genie back in the bottle.

496
00:27:00,115 --> 00:27:03,004
Hey, Harris. We are on silverware
duty, which means you...

497
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:05,080
Actually, I just had to drop in

498
00:27:05,105 --> 00:27:06,931
and fill out some paperwork.

499
00:27:06,997 --> 00:27:08,664
- Oh, no. Don't tell me that...
- No, no.

500
00:27:08,689 --> 00:27:10,836
I didn't get let go. They just...

501
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:13,750
don't want me training
with you two anymore.

502
00:27:13,963 --> 00:27:15,229
Oh, no.

503
00:27:15,231 --> 00:27:16,608
I really appreciate what you did.

504
00:27:16,633 --> 00:27:19,467
If I had been booted,
it would've proved my parents right.

505
00:27:19,469 --> 00:27:22,205
But I'm gonna be a paramedic
no matter what.

506
00:27:22,305 --> 00:27:24,385
Course you are.

507
00:27:24,574 --> 00:27:27,838
Well, thank you.

508
00:27:28,151 --> 00:27:29,963
I'll never forget you two.

509
00:27:35,051 --> 00:27:36,917
I liked training.
We should call Hatcher and...

510
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:39,553
Brett? You know what happens
when you poke a sleeping bear?

511
00:27:39,555 --> 00:27:41,656
There are teeth and claws and blood.

512
00:27:41,658 --> 00:27:44,071
Trust me. Consider ourselves lucky.

513
00:27:50,318 --> 00:27:51,914
Hey.

514
00:27:52,101 --> 00:27:53,367
What's up?

515
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:55,340
Police are gonna raid that drug house.

516
00:27:55,371 --> 00:27:57,130
Great.

517
00:27:57,829 --> 00:27:59,090
Or not great.

518
00:27:59,535 --> 00:28:02,452
There's a victim inside
who will do serious jail time.

519
00:28:03,722 --> 00:28:05,261
What can you do?

520
00:28:05,699 --> 00:28:07,114
Talk to Boden.

521
00:28:07,659 --> 00:28:09,968
You're gonna go Gabby Dawson
on this, aren't you?

522
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:18,811
And they feel they're out of options.

523
00:28:19,056 --> 00:28:22,718
They go to the police, their
daughter ends up in the system.

524
00:28:23,026 --> 00:28:25,970
Like it or not, she's an adult.

525
00:28:26,129 --> 00:28:27,362
Not.

526
00:28:27,501 --> 00:28:29,072
I don't like it, Chief.

527
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,999
I caught a glimpse of the guy
keeping her.

528
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,712
He's bad news.

529
00:28:32,803 --> 00:28:34,836
Not to mention he looks double her age.

530
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,137
Girl's got no chance.

531
00:28:36,139 --> 00:28:38,193
So, what do you suggest?

532
00:28:38,308 --> 00:28:40,740
- Benny got me thinking...
- Oh...

533
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:43,027
We're not gonna burn anything down.

534
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:44,763
We're just gonna...

535
00:28:46,495 --> 00:28:47,877
knock.

536
00:29:09,306 --> 00:29:10,801
Do you smell smoke?

537
00:29:11,775 --> 00:29:13,108
Oh, yeah.

538
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:15,076
Definitely coming from inside the house.

539
00:29:15,442 --> 00:29:16,978
Yeah.

540
00:29:17,317 --> 00:29:19,068
That's what I thought.

541
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:29,693
Fire department!
Everyone out of the house!

542
00:29:32,393 --> 00:29:34,119
Fire department!

543
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:37,033
I need everyone to clear
this building immediately.

544
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,025
What the hell is this?

545
00:29:40,143 --> 00:29:41,436
Fire evacuation.

546
00:29:41,438 --> 00:29:43,038
Get out of here.

547
00:29:43,135 --> 00:29:44,501
There ain't no damn fire in here.

548
00:29:44,526 --> 00:29:46,744
I'm not asking. Get out of here.

549
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,417
Go to hell, man.

550
00:29:57,488 --> 00:29:58,947
Please...

551
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:15,766
Y'all the ones who need to evacuate.

552
00:30:19,274 --> 00:30:22,406
There ain't no fire in here,
so y'all need to get.

553
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,931
Actually, the fire's in the walls.

554
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:28,347
Guys? Get it.

555
00:30:28,372 --> 00:30:30,206
On it, Lieutenant.

556
00:30:34,407 --> 00:30:36,007
I was talking to you!

557
00:30:48,587 --> 00:30:50,510
Forget him.

558
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:55,527
Let him run.

559
00:30:59,632 --> 00:31:01,466
Chelsea?

560
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,507
Chief, we're all clear here.

561
00:31:10,843 --> 00:31:14,001
Chelsea, we're here to help.

562
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,298
You can't.

563
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,516
I promise you we can.

564
00:31:21,036 --> 00:31:24,034
- Your parents...
- You don't know anything about me!

565
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:26,856
You're right, Chelsea. I don't.

566
00:31:28,224 --> 00:31:30,615
But she does.

567
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,912
Mom?

568
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,827
Dad?

569
00:31:38,905 --> 00:31:40,972
Yeah, baby, I'm here.

570
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,632
You threw me out.

571
00:31:45,745 --> 00:31:47,612
We were wrong.

572
00:31:50,716 --> 00:31:53,982
- I was wrong.
- You told me to leave!

573
00:31:54,007 --> 00:31:56,406
Chelsea, hey, listen to me.

574
00:31:58,691 --> 00:32:00,830
I have been where you're standing.

575
00:32:01,525 --> 00:32:03,228
No.

576
00:32:03,396 --> 00:32:05,494
It's true. I have.

577
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:09,737
The only difference is my parents
weren't alive to help me.

578
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:12,604
But your mom came here the other day,

579
00:32:12,606 --> 00:32:14,672
she was so desperate to rescue you.

580
00:32:16,348 --> 00:32:18,676
You came here?

581
00:32:18,763 --> 00:32:21,872
Yeah, baby. I came to get you.

582
00:32:24,116 --> 00:32:26,651
Your mom and dad love you, Chelsea.

583
00:32:29,588 --> 00:32:31,371
They want to help.

584
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:33,491
They need to help.

585
00:32:33,606 --> 00:32:36,527
And I will hold you in my arms

586
00:32:36,669 --> 00:32:39,004
the entire time if you'll let me, baby.

587
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,287
I promise.

588
00:32:42,469 --> 00:32:45,076
I just want to be free.

589
00:32:45,201 --> 00:32:47,705
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.
- I want... I want...

590
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,262
You're free, baby.

591
00:32:58,884 --> 00:33:02,255
It's okay. It's okay.

592
00:33:03,123 --> 00:33:05,674
Get some boards and seal off this place.

593
00:33:05,877 --> 00:33:10,111
Red-X it. Let CPD know
it's officially condemned.

594
00:33:10,386 --> 00:33:12,096
Copy that, Chief.

595
00:33:20,673 --> 00:33:21,936
Hey. How'd it go?

596
00:33:21,961 --> 00:33:23,775
She's at Med, detoxing.

597
00:33:23,985 --> 00:33:25,476
Your husband was amazing.

598
00:33:25,542 --> 00:33:27,712
Hey. So were you.

599
00:33:27,776 --> 00:33:29,159
What else is new?

600
00:33:34,553 --> 00:33:37,889
We know. We know. We're not
allowed to train anymore.

601
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:39,891
Yeah, I'd like to talk to you
about that, actually.

602
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,570
At a later date. Much later.

603
00:33:41,595 --> 00:33:43,202
Actually, about that...

604
00:33:45,841 --> 00:33:47,832
and it gives me great pleasure
to say this...

605
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:49,534
I just want to be clear.

606
00:33:49,536 --> 00:33:51,903
Gabriela Dawson and Sylvie Brett,

607
00:33:52,028 --> 00:33:53,972
you've been ordered
to mandatory re-training.

608
00:33:53,997 --> 00:33:55,106
Next shift.

609
00:33:55,108 --> 00:33:57,366
Report to the Fischer Classroom,
third floor of the academy.

610
00:33:57,391 --> 00:33:58,743
8:00 a.m. sharp.

611
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,578
And bring a number-two pencil.

612
00:34:06,652 --> 00:34:07,652
Hmm.

613
00:34:08,392 --> 00:34:10,388
Re-training. Re-training?

614
00:34:10,493 --> 00:34:12,523
Like every day
isn't re-training already?

615
00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:15,609
I should be the teacher of that class.
Hell, I am the teacher.

616
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,875
Name one thing they're gonna say to me
that I haven't seen or done 100 times.

617
00:34:18,977 --> 00:34:20,390
I can't.

618
00:34:25,357 --> 00:34:28,092
Look, if they want to pay me
to sit in a warm classroom

619
00:34:28,117 --> 00:34:30,590
instead of freezing my ass off
helping the citizens of Chicago,

620
00:34:30,615 --> 00:34:32,497
then be my guest.

621
00:34:32,683 --> 00:34:34,442
Hey, guys,

622
00:34:34,585 --> 00:34:36,886
can I get you to do a favor for me?

623
00:34:37,028 --> 00:34:38,988
What is it?

624
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:41,590
Who cares what it is. It's a favor.

625
00:34:41,592 --> 00:34:43,259
- You in or you out?
- I'm in.

626
00:34:43,261 --> 00:34:44,960
Thank you. Good.

627
00:34:44,962 --> 00:34:46,486
I'm gonna need more information.

628
00:34:46,511 --> 00:34:47,986
- No, you're not.
- Okay. I'm in.

629
00:34:48,011 --> 00:34:49,444
Yeah.

630
00:34:53,703 --> 00:34:56,026
So, now, listen, Lee Henry.

631
00:34:56,107 --> 00:34:58,415
You definitely have
the constitutional right

632
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,476
not to say the pledge of allegiance.

633
00:35:00,478 --> 00:35:02,242
You also have the right to be a jackass.

634
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:07,087
I'm kidding, all right? Sort of.

635
00:35:07,962 --> 00:35:10,437
Hey! I don't know
if you remember my old friend

636
00:35:10,462 --> 00:35:12,640
Eddie Wright, 1st Recon Battalion,

637
00:35:12,734 --> 00:35:14,790
Marine Corps, served in Iraq

638
00:35:14,866 --> 00:35:16,904
fighting for your constitutional rights.

639
00:35:16,929 --> 00:35:18,929
Look at you now. I haven't seen you

640
00:35:18,931 --> 00:35:20,798
since you were knee-high.

641
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,127
So, hey, Eddie, this is Chief Boden.

642
00:35:23,357 --> 00:35:25,274
- Sir, nice to meet you.
- Mutual.

643
00:35:25,299 --> 00:35:27,538
And fellow firefighter Randy McHolland.

644
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,673
- Sir, nice to meet you.
- My pleasure, Eddie.

645
00:35:29,675 --> 00:35:32,000
I hope you guys are hungry.
I got us a table over here.

646
00:35:32,025 --> 00:35:34,158
- Come on.
- All right. Thank you.

647
00:35:34,604 --> 00:35:36,674
Get going.

648
00:35:38,884 --> 00:35:41,412
Welcome. Enjoy yourself.

649
00:35:41,621 --> 00:35:43,881
Yeah. Thank you.

650
00:35:44,891 --> 00:35:46,257
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

651
00:35:46,259 --> 00:35:48,633
- Thank you for your service.
- Thank you.

652
00:35:49,262 --> 00:35:51,797
- Thank you for having us.
- Thank you.

653
00:35:53,733 --> 00:35:55,966
Thanks, everyone,
for coming down here today

654
00:35:55,968 --> 00:35:58,903
and chipping in
on the pancake breakfast.

655
00:35:58,998 --> 00:36:02,740
You know, that $5 is
the best deal in the city.

656
00:36:04,421 --> 00:36:07,955
Now, if you wouldn't mind,
let's all stand

657
00:36:08,114 --> 00:36:10,392
and remove our hats,

658
00:36:10,516 --> 00:36:12,892
put a hand over our hearts.

659
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:22,433
I pledge allegiance to the flag

660
00:36:22,527 --> 00:36:24,831
of the United States of America,

661
00:36:24,909 --> 00:36:27,808
and to the republic for which it stands,

662
00:36:27,929 --> 00:36:30,267
one nation, under God,

663
00:36:30,351 --> 00:36:31,669
indivisible,

664
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:34,772
with liberty and justice for all.

665
00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:37,082
Now let's eat!

666
00:36:37,285 --> 00:36:39,184
Let's eat.

667
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,895
How about that?

668
00:36:53,969 --> 00:36:56,459
How is she?

669
00:36:56,929 --> 00:36:59,006
Physically, she's fine.

670
00:36:59,235 --> 00:37:01,532
Mentally, it's going to be a long road,

671
00:37:01,672 --> 00:37:04,444
and, uh, recovery always has
its hills and valleys,

672
00:37:04,469 --> 00:37:06,070
but I am optimistic.

673
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:07,972
She moves to the rehab facility
tomorrow.

674
00:37:07,974 --> 00:37:09,539
Okay. Thanks, doc.

675
00:37:09,564 --> 00:37:11,430
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

676
00:37:16,725 --> 00:37:21,919
I am texting Dawson right now
telling her to meet us at Top Golf,

677
00:37:21,981 --> 00:37:24,698
because the first round
of games are on me.

678
00:37:24,723 --> 00:37:27,200
- Ooh.
- Mm-hmm.

679
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:29,787
I just said <i>I</i> was texting her.

680
00:37:29,812 --> 00:37:31,605
Yeah. I'm texting everyone else,

681
00:37:31,695 --> 00:37:33,665
since you're buying.

682
00:37:34,883 --> 00:37:36,043
Oh.

683
00:37:36,461 --> 00:37:38,796
So, the four paramedics are
Hillary, John,

684
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:40,296
Max, and Crazy Joe.

685
00:37:40,321 --> 00:37:43,196
Each one of them bets me that I
can't streak down a hallway,

686
00:37:43,221 --> 00:37:44,931
jump five feet over a bunch of tacks

687
00:37:44,956 --> 00:37:46,255
that they'd laid down on the floor,

688
00:37:46,257 --> 00:37:48,257
grab the fire pole, slide down,

689
00:37:48,259 --> 00:37:50,092
and do it all in my tighty-whities.

690
00:37:50,094 --> 00:37:52,328
So, Crazy Joe... I say to him, "Listen,

691
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,163
there's no time like the
present... let's do this."

692
00:37:54,165 --> 00:37:56,465
So I get to the end of the
hallway, off comes the shirt,

693
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:59,335
off come the pants, and...
oh, there she is.

694
00:37:59,401 --> 00:38:01,050
This must be the lucky lady.

695
00:38:01,105 --> 00:38:02,438
- Hi.
- I'm Benny.

696
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,506
- Hi.
- Hi!

697
00:38:06,013 --> 00:38:07,715
- You all right?
- Yeah.

698
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,911
Course she's all right.

699
00:38:08,913 --> 00:38:11,113
This is the best steakhouse
in Chicago, isn't it?

700
00:38:11,115 --> 00:38:13,363
Hey, George, do me a favor and
get this young lady a cocktail.

701
00:38:13,388 --> 00:38:15,576
- No... just a water, please.
- Okay, in that case,

702
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:17,732
I'll have the cocktail,
and Trish will have another...

703
00:38:17,757 --> 00:38:19,822
whatever these umbrella things are.

704
00:38:19,824 --> 00:38:22,124
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

705
00:38:22,126 --> 00:38:24,636
Anna, this is Trish,
and Trish this is Anna.

706
00:38:24,661 --> 00:38:27,191
She's my son's main squeeze.
Or so I'm told.

707
00:38:27,216 --> 00:38:29,425
- It's really nice to meet you.
- You too.

708
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:32,501
- How was your shift?
- It was fine.

709
00:38:32,684 --> 00:38:35,037
Anna's a pediatric nurse at Chicago Med.

710
00:38:35,168 --> 00:38:36,868
Is that, like, a foot doctor?

711
00:38:36,893 --> 00:38:39,243
No. That's a podiatric.

712
00:38:39,268 --> 00:38:40,784
She works with children.

713
00:38:40,878 --> 00:38:43,321
many in the oncology... cancer unit.

714
00:38:43,346 --> 00:38:44,513
Oh, great. That's cool.

715
00:38:44,515 --> 00:38:46,515
And I work with the big children.

716
00:38:46,517 --> 00:38:49,218
Yes. Big and old.

717
00:38:49,306 --> 00:38:51,845
I cop to that.

718
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:56,825
Oh, bone-in steak girl.
That's a good sign.

719
00:38:57,111 --> 00:38:59,205
That looks good.

720
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,728
Actually, I, um...

721
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:04,133
- I have to go.
- What?

722
00:39:04,252 --> 00:39:07,686
It was really nice to meet you.
Um, enjoy your dinner.

723
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:10,178
Excuse me.

724
00:39:20,251 --> 00:39:22,085
Anna!

725
00:39:22,186 --> 00:39:24,053
Anna, hey, I'm sorry.
Look, I didn't know

726
00:39:24,078 --> 00:39:25,670
- that he was gonna bring someone.
- Kelly...

727
00:39:25,695 --> 00:39:28,528
And I know what you're thinking,
but I told you: Benny's not me.

728
00:39:28,644 --> 00:39:31,458
I spent my whole life avoiding... that.

729
00:39:31,483 --> 00:39:33,982
You know what? Maybe this was
just a really, like, bad idea.

730
00:39:34,007 --> 00:39:36,896
Maybe me moving here
and rushing things...

731
00:39:36,921 --> 00:39:39,925
maybe this was all just a really
terrible, terrible idea.

732
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,801
That's not what I'm saying.
This isn't something that...

733
00:39:41,826 --> 00:39:43,587
I think we're wrong
for each other, Kelly,

734
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,481
and I think we've been idiots
not to see it.

735
00:39:47,569 --> 00:39:49,149
What are you even talking about?

736
00:39:49,243 --> 00:39:52,129
I told my family I was probably making
the biggest mistake of my life,

737
00:39:52,131 --> 00:39:54,618
and it turns out that I was.

738
00:39:54,891 --> 00:39:56,457
Anna.

739
00:40:01,588 --> 00:40:03,554
Good-bye, Kelly.

740
00:40:15,362 --> 00:40:20,362

1
00:00:00,847 --> 00:00:02,877
- Happy pay day, everyone.
- You forgot someone.

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,297
There wasn't a check
in the package for you.

3
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:05,398
Maybe she took it.

4
00:00:05,401 --> 00:00:07,656
- She would never do that.
- She is either messing

5
00:00:07,659 --> 00:00:09,629
with me or she's incompetent.

6
00:00:09,632 --> 00:00:11,286
I'm gonna really hate to think

7
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:13,515
that you would mess with
any of my friends here

8
00:00:13,517 --> 00:00:15,085
just to make yourself look better.

9
00:00:15,088 --> 00:00:18,707
So what happens if I
don't pay rent this month?

10
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,543
You can stay as long as you want.

11
00:00:20,546 --> 00:00:22,396
You're a good friend.

12
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:25,733
Dad, what's going on?

13
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:28,414
I've been imposing on
you for way too long.

14
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:30,602
I've got three great job leads.

15
00:00:30,605 --> 00:00:33,606
I'm on the move to the
next chapter of life

16
00:00:33,608 --> 00:00:35,409
of Ramón Dawsona.

17
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:37,437
Mm.

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,910
Well, the job's going great, you know.

19
00:00:39,913 --> 00:00:41,646
They're not the most friendly bunch,

20
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:44,149
but, uh, they're warming
up to your pops, huh.

21
00:00:44,152 --> 00:00:45,551
That's good.

22
00:00:45,554 --> 00:00:47,587
They're a little outdated in terms

23
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,058
of the way that they
use their workforce.

24
00:00:50,061 --> 00:00:51,593
Long story short,

25
00:00:51,596 --> 00:00:53,930
I'm requesting a
meeting with Jake, okay?

26
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:56,067
'Cause I want to pitch some of my ideas

27
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:58,102
for running a smoother workplace.

28
00:00:58,104 --> 00:01:00,938
Jake's the division supervisor, young...

29
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,606
How long's this company been going?

30
00:01:02,608 --> 00:01:04,942
Uh, 35 years.

31
00:01:04,944 --> 00:01:08,078
And you been there... like a month?

32
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,548
Yeah. A little more. Why?

33
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,551
Well, maybe it'd be a
better idea if you settle in,

34
00:01:13,553 --> 00:01:15,886
keep your nose down, get
a year under your belt

35
00:01:15,888 --> 00:01:17,349
before you start
cracking eggshells, Dad.

36
00:01:17,351 --> 00:01:20,123
Yeah, sure.

37
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:22,259
Does Matt still have his
connections at City Hall?

38
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:23,593
I mean, I'm assuming he does.

39
00:01:23,595 --> 00:01:26,129
Dave, who is the big boss, okay?

40
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:28,131
I happen to overhear him talking

41
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:30,967
about some rezoning issues
that he was having...

42
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:32,702
Forget it.

43
00:01:32,704 --> 00:01:34,653
Matt's done with
politics now and forever.

44
00:01:34,656 --> 00:01:37,139
Okay. Okay, well...

45
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:39,710
- It's just I was thinking...
- Not a good idea.

46
00:01:43,147 --> 00:01:45,548
And the next morning...

47
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:49,285
And that is why I will
never eat another Cronut.

48
00:01:51,422 --> 00:01:53,322
Oh, hey, check it out.

49
00:01:54,492 --> 00:01:56,392
Huh, that's a shame.

50
00:01:56,394 --> 00:01:57,859
I always wanted to go in there.

51
00:01:57,862 --> 00:02:00,564
Yeah, that's why they're
going out of business.

52
00:02:06,336 --> 00:02:08,937
We could use some more stock at Molly's.

53
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:14,576
I got to tell Herrmann.

54
00:02:14,578 --> 00:02:17,178
I'm telling you.

55
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,081
Look, you want to set the right tone.

56
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,683
So you put on Sade "Diamond life."

57
00:02:21,685 --> 00:02:23,485
I usually don't pay
attention to the music.

58
00:02:23,487 --> 00:02:25,987
I know, I'm trying to
help you up your game.

59
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:27,490
- My game needs no upping.
- Ehh.

60
00:02:27,493 --> 00:02:28,272
You know what?

61
00:02:28,275 --> 00:02:31,025
Why don't you just pay
attention to yourself.

62
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:32,293
Still gonna buy you the album

63
00:02:32,295 --> 00:02:33,628
so you'll have it on your iTunes.

64
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,130
Truck 81.

65
00:02:35,132 --> 00:02:36,964
Ambulance 61, Engine 51

66
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:39,199
845 Dearborn Avenue, Restaurant Fire.

67
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,686
- What do we got?
- It was a grease fire,

68
00:02:59,688 --> 00:03:01,321
but it spread so fast...

69
00:03:01,323 --> 00:03:03,157
Everyone's out of the floor level but...

70
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:05,725
- Otis. Raise the aerial.
- Copy.

71

72
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,530
Line up. Stay calm.

73
00:03:45,532 --> 00:03:47,332
Line up over here. Nice and easy.

74
00:03:47,334 --> 00:03:49,401
One at a time. Come on.

75
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:51,236
Let's line up, guys.

76
00:03:51,238 --> 00:03:52,920
- Okay, let's go!
- Let's go!

77
00:03:52,923 --> 00:03:54,863
One at a time, one at a
time. Stay calm, good job.

78
00:03:54,865 --> 00:03:57,209
Hey, listen, one at a time. Let's go.

79
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:00,713
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You good?

80
00:04:00,715 --> 00:04:02,380
- Yeah.
- Step this way, come on.

81
00:04:02,382 --> 00:04:03,748
- Come on.
- On this side.

82
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,383
- You're all right.
- Let's move on.

83
00:04:05,385 --> 00:04:07,051
Let's go!

84
00:04:07,053 --> 00:04:08,687
Stay calm, stay calm.

85
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:11,122
- Get in line.
- Oh, my God, please!

86
00:04:11,124 --> 00:04:13,124
Hang on. Let's go!

87
00:04:13,126 --> 00:04:15,527
No! My baby!

88
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:20,198
Ma'am, you got to get
back from the fire.

89
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,699
Help me! I can't get it out.

90
00:04:21,701 --> 00:04:24,535
- It's too hot!
- Kidd!

91
00:04:24,537 --> 00:04:26,704
Help me! Oh, my God!
Please help. Please!

92
00:04:26,706 --> 00:04:29,107
I can't.

93
00:04:31,377 --> 00:04:33,778
- Help. Come on.
- No! No!

94
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,546
Ma'am, come on. We
got to get out of here.

95
00:04:35,548 --> 00:04:36,951
No! I'm not leaving my baby!

96
00:04:36,954 --> 00:04:38,815
- We got her.
- Josefina! Josefina!

97
00:04:38,817 --> 00:04:40,751
Ma'am, she's got your
baby. Let us do our jobs.

98
00:04:42,655 --> 00:04:44,421
All right.

99
00:04:44,423 --> 00:04:47,424
Shh. It's going to be okay.

100
00:04:56,468 --> 00:04:58,601
Hey! Kidd!

101
00:04:58,603 --> 00:05:00,303
Let's go.

102
00:05:03,742 --> 00:05:06,243
Come on.

103
00:05:09,514 --> 00:05:11,781
Move.

104
00:05:11,783 --> 00:05:15,485
You're all right.

105
00:05:15,487 --> 00:05:17,287
- Got it.
- There we go.

106
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:19,656
Okay.

107
00:05:19,658 --> 00:05:21,123
Up.

108
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:31,700
Turn around. There you go.

109
00:05:31,702 --> 00:05:33,635
Turn around. You've got it.

110
00:05:33,637 --> 00:05:35,604
Nice and easy.

111
00:05:36,207 --> 00:05:38,340
Go down slowly, sir.

112
00:05:38,342 --> 00:05:39,775
Yeah, good.

113
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:43,312
Just wait.

114
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:48,517
I got you.

115
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:51,620
Oh, I know. I know.

116
00:05:51,622 --> 00:05:53,154
She's safe and sound.

117
00:05:53,156 --> 00:05:55,219
Oh, my God.

118
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:56,906
Let's have ambo check her out

119
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:58,827
just to make sure
everything's okay, all right?

120
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:00,962
- Thank you.
- Oh, shh, shh.

121
00:06:00,964 --> 00:06:02,831
- It's okay.
- Thank you so much.

122
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:05,533
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

123
00:06:05,535 --> 00:06:08,336
Oh. Oh.

124
00:06:08,338 --> 00:06:10,205
Okay.

125
00:06:12,642 --> 00:06:14,742
- It's okay, baby.
- Yeah.

126
00:06:20,182 --> 00:06:21,742
What?

127
00:06:27,724 --> 00:06:29,990
- Fire's out.
- Yep.

128
00:06:29,992 --> 00:06:32,328
All right, 81, let's pack her up.

129
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:40,901
Man. Hey.

130
00:06:40,903 --> 00:06:43,670
What do you think of these?

131
00:06:43,672 --> 00:06:46,506
I heard they have some now
where they change colors

132
00:06:46,508 --> 00:06:48,375
when you set your beer on them.

133
00:06:48,377 --> 00:06:49,576
What?

134
00:06:49,578 --> 00:06:51,244
Special paper.

135
00:06:51,246 --> 00:06:53,446
Hey. Herrmann.

136
00:06:53,448 --> 00:06:55,382
What do you think of these?

137
00:06:55,384 --> 00:06:56,516
They're fine. So, listen.

138
00:06:56,518 --> 00:06:57,982
There's this bar over by where

139
00:06:57,985 --> 00:06:59,285
Cruz and Brett and I live...

140
00:06:59,287 --> 00:07:00,920
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, it's called Mac's Bar.

141
00:07:00,922 --> 00:07:04,223
- M-A-X?
- No, M-A-C-apostrophe-S.

142
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:05,958
It's not important. What is important...

143
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,039
It is that they are
going out of business.

144
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:10,763
- Oh, that's a shame.
- Uh-huh.

145
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:13,266
But what I thought is
maybe I could stop by

146
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:14,795
and see what I could
scrounge up, you know,

147
00:07:14,797 --> 00:07:16,535
glassware, taps...

148
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,604
cocktail napkins.

149
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:21,039
Never know, might be
able to get some steals.

150
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,902
- Uh-uh. Bad idea.
- Well, what do you mean?

151
00:07:23,905 --> 00:07:24,954
You're the one that's always going on

152
00:07:24,956 --> 00:07:26,256
about the cost of overhead.

153
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:27,992
Yeah, but we ain't no vultures.

154
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:30,094
You profit on someone
else's pain? Uh-uh.

155
00:07:30,097 --> 00:07:31,203
Bad luck.

156
00:07:31,206 --> 00:07:33,195
We literally bought a burned out bar.

157
00:07:33,198 --> 00:07:35,553
Yeah, and it took us three
years to turn a profit.

158
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:36,674
Think about it.

159
00:07:36,677 --> 00:07:38,210
I don't understand you sometimes.

160
00:07:38,213 --> 00:07:40,625
- Most of the time.
- That's it.

161
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,428
There but for the
grace of God go I, boys.

162
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,741
Connie.

163
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:58,400
Yes?

164
00:07:58,403 --> 00:08:00,611
Where are the yellow forms
for the incident reports?

165
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,447
Um, they should be on your desk.

166
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:03,791
- They're not.
- Um...

167
00:08:03,794 --> 00:08:05,557
Are these what you're looking for?

168
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,752
Those are they. Thank you, Hope.

169
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:09,753
No sweat. Need anything else?

170
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:11,855
- Coffee?
- No, that's it.

171
00:08:15,717 --> 00:08:19,485
I could have sworn...

172
00:08:19,488 --> 00:08:21,369
He won't get out of his own way.

173
00:08:21,372 --> 00:08:22,805
I tell him, "Pop, you're new there.

174
00:08:22,808 --> 00:08:24,435
"You got to keep your
head down for a year.

175
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:25,769
You do your work, don't make waves,

176
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,103
show up early, leave late,

177
00:08:27,105 --> 00:08:28,280
and they're gonna love you."

178
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:30,374
Yeah, because Dawsons never make waves.

179
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:31,710
I'm gonna ignore that.

180
00:08:31,713 --> 00:08:32,945
Well, maybe they'll be impressed

181
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:34,944
- your dad took some initiative.
- No, uhuh.

182
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,047
I know the ending to that story,

183
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,568
and it involves collecting your things

184
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,038
and being escorted to the parking lot.

185
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,240
- Come on.
- I've seen it.

186
00:08:41,243 --> 00:08:43,116
Well, it's good you're there for him.

187
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:44,726
I'm the only one he's got.

188
00:08:44,729 --> 00:08:45,897
Antonio's not talking to him.

189
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,264
My mom deletes his text
messages without reading them.

190
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:49,229
Like, I mean, it's just...

191
00:08:49,231 --> 00:08:51,727
It's just so frustrating,

192
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,895
and he's alone and he's my dad,

193
00:08:53,898 --> 00:08:55,306
but I don't know...

194
00:08:55,309 --> 00:08:58,368
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

195
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,035
Sometimes all you can do is

196
00:09:00,037 --> 00:09:03,197
help people pick up the
pieces when they fall down.

197
00:09:11,749 --> 00:09:14,750
Uh-oh, Captain Casey's
got that look in his eye.

198
00:09:14,752 --> 00:09:17,552
Oh, Casey's cooking.
What's the occasion?

199
00:09:17,554 --> 00:09:19,988
Celebrating a job well
done today on Truck 81.

200
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,157
That's some real
leadership there, fellas.

201
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:24,502
Hey, I am a man of the people.

202
00:09:24,505 --> 00:09:25,860
Mm-hmm.

203
00:09:25,862 --> 00:09:28,397
Stella...

204
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,665
- envelope for you.
- Oh.

205
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:32,174
Thanks.

206
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,463
What?

207
00:09:40,844 --> 00:09:42,176
I...

208
00:09:42,178 --> 00:09:44,779
What is it, Kidd?

209
00:09:44,781 --> 00:09:47,849
I just got transferred to the
Office of Public Relations.

210
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,306
I'm firefighter.

211
00:09:57,309 --> 00:09:59,043
I'm not a desk jockey. I just...

212
00:09:59,046 --> 00:10:00,767
What do I know about public relations?

213
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,884
I can barely keep up
with my own relations.

214
00:10:02,887 --> 00:10:03,995
Yeah, I can attest to that.

215
00:10:03,997 --> 00:10:05,806
Not in the mood.

216
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:07,932
Mouch, what can we do
from a union point-of-view?

217
00:10:07,934 --> 00:10:10,616
Unfortunately, there's
not much the union can do.

218
00:10:10,619 --> 00:10:12,904
Stella will have to fill
out a grievance form,

219
00:10:12,906 --> 00:10:14,530
then wait for a committee review,

220
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:16,808
and hope they rule in her favor, but...

221
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,733
that could take months or years.

222
00:10:18,736 --> 00:10:19,892
Well, you're a Captain now.

223
00:10:19,895 --> 00:10:21,645
Don't you have a say
in personnel decisions?

224
00:10:21,647 --> 00:10:22,845
I mean, you would think so.

225
00:10:22,848 --> 00:10:24,282
Can I put in a special request?

226
00:10:24,284 --> 00:10:25,416
Above my pay grade.

227
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:27,785
Not above mine.

228
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:30,120
Look, I was caught flatfooted here too.

229
00:10:30,122 --> 00:10:32,327
I put in a call to the
Office of Public Relations

230
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,826
and not only is the
transfer happening...

231
00:10:35,828 --> 00:10:37,517
It's happening next shift.

232
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,062
So I put in a call to Chief Huffhines

233
00:10:39,064 --> 00:10:40,664
who oversees the department

234
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,729
He hasn't gotten back to me yet,

235
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:43,369
but I want to talk it over with him.

236
00:10:43,372 --> 00:10:45,033
And I want to assure him that I think

237
00:10:45,036 --> 00:10:46,836
the services of Stella
Kidd are best served

238
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:49,239
with Halligan in her hand.

239
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:51,308
Thank you, Chief.

240
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,143
You should have seen her today.

241
00:10:53,145 --> 00:10:55,178
One woman wrecking crew.

242
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,813
I believe it.

243
00:10:58,483 --> 00:11:00,317
In the meantime,

244
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:02,318
let's not let this be a distraction,

245
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,087
but when that bell goes off...

246
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:06,823
all business all day.

247
00:11:06,825 --> 00:11:09,545
- Of course, Chief.
- Absolutely, Chief.

248
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:17,500
God.

249
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:25,107
Hmm, yeah.

250
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,443
I can't believe this.

251
00:11:28,445 --> 00:11:29,728
No warning?

252
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,947
It stinks on ice.

253
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:35,183
- What does that mean?
- Extra stinky, like fish.

254
00:11:35,185 --> 00:11:37,506
They can really just
transfer anyone at any time?

255
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:40,355
Everybody needs to take
a breath, all right?

256
00:11:40,357 --> 00:11:43,525
Boden's really passionate about
keeping his house together.

257
00:11:43,527 --> 00:11:45,894
Herrmann's right. He'll find a way.

258
00:12:19,395 --> 00:12:21,495
Can't sleep?

259
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:28,435
Wired.

260
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,442
You know...

261
00:12:35,444 --> 00:12:39,512
Don't be angry for what
I'm about to say, but...

262
00:12:39,514 --> 00:12:41,414
this transfer

263
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,784
could very well be a
blessing in disguise.

264
00:12:46,254 --> 00:12:47,931
How do you figure?

265
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,257
Well...

266
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:54,093
Working in PR means

267
00:12:54,095 --> 00:12:56,596
you're the public face of the CFD.

268
00:12:56,598 --> 00:12:58,597
So you could...

269
00:12:58,599 --> 00:13:02,101
speak up for issues that
are important to you.

270
00:13:02,103 --> 00:13:04,203
You know, women's issues,

271
00:13:04,205 --> 00:13:06,072
city employee issues,

272
00:13:06,074 --> 00:13:09,837
things the general public
never knew about us.

273
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:14,412
Mm.

274
00:13:14,414 --> 00:13:16,982
I never thought about that.

275
00:13:16,984 --> 00:13:19,117
Just looking at it from a...

276
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:20,697
different angle.

277
00:13:23,323 --> 00:13:27,258
I'm a firefighter, Mouch.

278
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,628
When we were on that roof today...

279
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,396
All I could think about was getting

280
00:13:31,398 --> 00:13:33,498
that mom and that baby to safety.

281
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,333
Nothing was gonna stop me.

282
00:13:35,335 --> 00:13:37,835
You could have put
1,000 pounds on my back,

283
00:13:37,837 --> 00:13:41,272
you could have turned the
fire up a million degrees

284
00:13:41,274 --> 00:13:44,942
and I still would made that save.

285
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:53,150
What made you want
to pick up a Halligan?

286
00:13:53,152 --> 00:13:55,319
I mean, in the beginning?

287
00:14:00,192 --> 00:14:03,160
I climbed into a car I shouldn't have.

288
00:14:03,162 --> 00:14:06,163
And the only reason I climbed out

289
00:14:06,165 --> 00:14:09,333
was 'cause of the CFD rescue squad.

290
00:14:09,335 --> 00:14:11,420
So I made a decision in the hospital.

291
00:14:11,423 --> 00:14:15,539
I said, "I'm gonna lift
people out of bad places too."

292
00:14:17,976 --> 00:14:20,376
So that's what I do.

293
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:29,686
You know what...

294
00:14:29,688 --> 00:14:32,736
Enough about this. Give me that flicker.

295
00:14:43,268 --> 00:14:45,234
Hey, where's Stella?

296
00:14:45,236 --> 00:14:46,830
Eh, she ducked out early.

297
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,928
She didn't want to make
a scene of it, you know.

298
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:52,108
Her words.

299
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,610
Hey. So...

300
00:14:54,612 --> 00:14:56,579
This might be totally
not the time, but...

301
00:14:56,581 --> 00:14:59,048
I was looking through the
files on Mrs. Donovan's desk,

302
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:02,284
and it turns out that the money
allotted for the Spring Picnic

303
00:15:02,286 --> 00:15:03,686
was never used,

304
00:15:03,688 --> 00:15:06,608
which means that we have $900

305
00:15:06,611 --> 00:15:09,224
in the petty cash fund.

306
00:15:09,226 --> 00:15:11,259
I overheard you guys
talking the other day

307
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:13,728
about needing a new
outside barbecue grill.

308
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:17,099
I thought maybe...

309
00:15:17,101 --> 00:15:19,572
I could use that money to get one.

310
00:15:22,739 --> 00:15:26,240
You were wrong.

311
00:15:26,242 --> 00:15:28,275
It was exactly the right time

312
00:15:28,277 --> 00:15:32,113
for us to here this kind of news so...

313
00:15:32,115 --> 00:15:33,648
Thanks, Hope.

314
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,449
We appreciate your energy around here.

315
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:37,134
Means a lot.

316
00:15:38,722 --> 00:15:40,377
I'll make it happen.

317
00:15:47,396 --> 00:15:49,205
Breakfast to go?

318
00:15:51,894 --> 00:15:55,996
Yeah, Colopsky on third shift
always brings in Firecakes.

319
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:58,639
Hey.

320
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:01,407
So...

321
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:03,041
Now that I've been here a little while

322
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:05,812
and I'm not so intimidated by Connie,

323
00:16:05,814 --> 00:16:08,749
I was thinking...

324
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:12,753
maybe we should hang out again sometime.

325
00:16:12,755 --> 00:16:14,470
Like tonight.

326
00:16:17,492 --> 00:16:22,162
Uh, I got plans tonight, but thanks.

327
00:16:22,164 --> 00:16:24,197
Another time then.

328
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:26,666
Another time.

329
00:16:35,342 --> 00:16:36,809
- You all ready?
- No.

330
00:16:36,811 --> 00:16:38,343
Thanks for telling me.

331
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:39,845
I appreciate it.

332
00:16:39,847 --> 00:16:42,347
I will. I'll take care of it.

333
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:44,516
Thanks, Chuck.

334
00:16:44,518 --> 00:16:46,786
That was Chuck Davis from the 55th Ward.

335
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:48,554
He got a call from your father,

336
00:16:48,556 --> 00:16:50,025
throwing my name around,

337
00:16:50,028 --> 00:16:51,275
asking for a zoning favor.

338
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:53,967
I-I told him not to
bother you with that stuff.

339
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:57,229
Well, he didn't. He went around me.

340
00:16:57,231 --> 00:16:58,797
I'm gonna give him an earful.

341
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:00,017
I'm trying to figure out

342
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,938
if there's any way to keep Stella at 51,

343
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:03,302
and then I'm dealing with phone calls

344
00:17:03,304 --> 00:17:04,303
from pissed-off alderman.

345
00:17:04,305 --> 00:17:05,369
I hear you.

346
00:17:05,371 --> 00:17:06,744
I will take care of it.

347
00:17:13,513 --> 00:17:15,313
Uh...

348
00:17:15,315 --> 00:17:17,215
Hello.

349
00:17:17,217 --> 00:17:19,086
I, uh...

350
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:21,098
I noticed your sign out front.

351
00:17:21,101 --> 00:17:22,520
I'm a fellow bar owner.

352
00:17:22,522 --> 00:17:25,125
I was just, uh, curious to
see what you had for sale.

353
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,258
Just gonna come in and pick
the meat off my carcass,

354
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,227
- isn't that about it?
- Oh.

355
00:17:29,229 --> 00:17:32,125
- Uh, no sir. I just...
- Dad, please.

356
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,400
I'm sorry, sir. Come in,
look around all you want.

357
00:17:36,402 --> 00:17:38,435
Uh, are you sure?

358
00:17:38,437 --> 00:17:40,403
- I don't want to...
- Don't worry about him.

359
00:17:40,405 --> 00:17:42,906
He's um... didn't
want to face the music,

360
00:17:42,908 --> 00:17:44,574
but here we are.

361
00:17:44,576 --> 00:17:46,777
30 years he put this bar together,

362
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:50,413
and it only took one bad
loan to bring it all down.

363
00:17:50,415 --> 00:17:52,116
It's a shame, really.

364
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:55,184
You're... his daughter?

365
00:17:55,186 --> 00:17:56,586
Yes, Lily.

366
00:17:56,588 --> 00:17:58,722
Hi. Uh, Brian.

367
00:17:58,724 --> 00:18:00,790
Did I hear you own a bar too?

368
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:03,460
Uh... Molly's.

369
00:18:03,462 --> 00:18:05,395
- Molly's bar.
- Yeah, um...

370
00:18:05,397 --> 00:18:06,763
Twinkle lights on the ceiling

371
00:18:06,765 --> 00:18:08,365
- I love that place.
- You've been?

372
00:18:08,367 --> 00:18:09,432
- I have.
- Cool.

373
00:18:09,434 --> 00:18:10,437
I kept telling Dad,

374
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,768
"Hey, come check out Molly's,"

375
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,402
but he wouldn't hear of it.

376
00:18:14,605 --> 00:18:16,139
He's jealous.

377
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:18,274
Oh.

378
00:18:18,276 --> 00:18:19,742
Anyway,

379
00:18:19,744 --> 00:18:23,712
if you can find a home
for anything here...

380
00:18:23,714 --> 00:18:25,882
let me know.

381
00:18:30,554 --> 00:18:33,322
Dad, call me back as soon as possible.

382
00:18:37,227 --> 00:18:41,263
Herrmann, we need a
big ol' stage for music.

383
00:18:41,265 --> 00:18:42,765
- Hey.
- What, right?

384
00:18:42,767 --> 00:18:44,800
Easy.

385
00:18:44,802 --> 00:18:46,467
Is she not working tonight?

386
00:18:46,469 --> 00:18:48,236
She clocked out and bottoms up.

387
00:18:48,238 --> 00:18:49,805
- How many has she had?
- Two.

388
00:18:49,807 --> 00:18:51,436
You talking about the
two that I poured her,

389
00:18:51,438 --> 00:18:53,204
or the two that you poured her?

390
00:18:53,207 --> 00:18:57,312
Look, the problem... the problem with

391
00:18:57,314 --> 00:18:59,848
some of the people... Some of the people.

392
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,251
- Hey.
- That come in

393
00:19:01,254 --> 00:19:02,950
Hey, that's enough. Come on, that's it.

394
00:19:02,952 --> 00:19:04,652
- Come on.
- We don't have to...

395
00:19:04,654 --> 00:19:07,322
- We don't have to go.
- Ah, no. We're gonna go.

396
00:19:07,324 --> 00:19:09,524
Kelly, okay, all right.

397
00:19:09,526 --> 00:19:12,259
Bye! I'm...

398
00:19:12,261 --> 00:19:13,994
- Bye.
- I'm sorry.

399
00:19:13,996 --> 00:19:15,996
Stop. You don't have to.

400
00:19:15,998 --> 00:19:17,631
- Come on.
- Okay. Okay.

401
00:19:17,633 --> 00:19:19,666
All right, all right. Here we go.

402
00:19:19,668 --> 00:19:22,269
- Here we go.
- I got it.

403
00:19:22,271 --> 00:19:23,938
- You got it?
- You got it.

404
00:19:23,941 --> 00:19:26,290
- You got it.
- Okay, whatever.

405
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:40,220
Not like this.

406
00:19:41,657 --> 00:19:44,458
I...

407
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:15,344
Ouch.

408
00:20:17,047 --> 00:20:18,612
No judging.

409
00:20:18,614 --> 00:20:20,781
I've had a few benders in my day.

410
00:20:20,783 --> 00:20:22,283
And the problem is you always end up

411
00:20:22,285 --> 00:20:23,718
like that in the morning.

412
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,686
How did I get back

413
00:20:25,688 --> 00:20:27,621
to the apartment last night?

414
00:20:29,425 --> 00:20:30,969
I brought you.

415
00:20:32,595 --> 00:20:34,762
Wow, I...

416
00:20:34,764 --> 00:20:39,367
I do not remember anything past Molly's.

417
00:20:50,989 --> 00:20:52,633
You want some eggs?

418
00:20:56,151 --> 00:20:58,551
I mean, will it make
my head stop throbbing?

419
00:20:58,553 --> 00:21:01,321
It won't hurt.

420
00:21:01,323 --> 00:21:03,390
God.

421
00:21:15,637 --> 00:21:17,336
Chief Huffhines...

422
00:21:17,338 --> 00:21:19,938
- Just the man we came to see.
- Wallace.

423
00:21:19,941 --> 00:21:21,775
I don't know if you
know Captain Matt Casey.

424
00:21:21,777 --> 00:21:23,609
Uh-oh, you got looks in your eyes

425
00:21:23,611 --> 00:21:25,144
like you want something.

426
00:21:25,146 --> 00:21:26,758
That obvious, huh?

427
00:21:26,761 --> 00:21:29,107
Like my wife when she wants
me to empty the cat litter.

428
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,516
Well, it's actually

429
00:21:30,518 --> 00:21:31,684
about the position you're filling

430
00:21:31,686 --> 00:21:32,966
in Public Relations office...

431
00:21:32,969 --> 00:21:33,789
Yes.

432
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,355
Something I've been
angling for since last year.

433
00:21:36,357 --> 00:21:39,257
We need fresh blood in the department.

434
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:42,427
So much of what the city
does is stuck in 1974.

435
00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:44,329
- I understand that...
- Which is why I said,

436
00:21:44,331 --> 00:21:47,357
"We need a woman firefighter
front and center."

437
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,600
My understanding is that Montague...

438
00:21:49,602 --> 00:21:51,303
She's the real deal.

439
00:21:51,305 --> 00:21:52,703
Excuse me, did you say Montague?

440
00:21:52,705 --> 00:21:54,149
Do you mean Stella Kidd?

441
00:21:54,152 --> 00:21:56,133
Well, I saw a list of names.

442
00:21:56,136 --> 00:21:57,769
I wasn't sure who it was.

443
00:21:57,772 --> 00:21:59,289
I'm just glad it's happening.

444
00:21:59,292 --> 00:22:01,712
I was under the impression
you asked for Stella Kidd

445
00:22:01,714 --> 00:22:03,548
- personally.
- I did not.

446
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:06,451
But I stopped trying to
figure out the, you know,

447
00:22:06,453 --> 00:22:09,520
machinations of the CFD a long time ago.

448
00:22:09,522 --> 00:22:11,110
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me,

449
00:22:11,113 --> 00:22:13,958
my son has a basketball
tournament in Bloomington.

450
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,960
Is there anything else?

451
00:22:15,962 --> 00:22:18,495
- Good to see you, Dave.
- Wallace.

452
00:22:18,497 --> 00:22:20,630
Matt.

453
00:22:39,585 --> 00:22:41,718
Hey.

454
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,754
Captain.

455
00:22:44,756 --> 00:22:47,657
- Matt Casey.
- No, I'm Manfredi.

456
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:50,759
No, I'm introducing
myself. I'm Matt Casey.

457
00:22:50,761 --> 00:22:52,695
- Captain.
- Right.

458
00:22:52,697 --> 00:22:53,985
Got it.

459
00:22:55,566 --> 00:22:57,500
Welcome to 51, Manfredi.

460
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:59,502
Sure am glad to be here.

461
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:07,676
We got a chowder-head
replacement for Kidd.

462
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,444
He asked me where the bathroom was,

463
00:23:09,446 --> 00:23:11,375
and then he just stayed right there.

464
00:23:18,623 --> 00:23:20,689
All right. What's this?

465
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,289
Something I worked on all weekend.

466
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:24,692
Now I know what a shrewd
businessman you are, Herrmann,

467
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:27,029
which is why I really
wanted to take the time

468
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:29,364
put together a proper
strategic proposal.

469
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,954
Is this about that bar closing?

470
00:23:30,957 --> 00:23:33,601
- 'Cause I already told you...
- It is. It is about that bar.

471
00:23:33,603 --> 00:23:36,538
But instead of closing...

472
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,239
what if we partner with it?

473
00:23:38,241 --> 00:23:39,422
Hm?

474
00:23:39,425 --> 00:23:40,657
I know, I know,

475
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,378
but just look at this
chart on page three.

476
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,313
Go ahead, look at it.
Go ahead, go ahead.

477
00:23:47,316 --> 00:23:50,652
Now, we can drive lower
cost from our suppliers

478
00:23:50,654 --> 00:23:53,555
on beer, wine, spirits, and supplies.

479
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:56,590
We can amortize those
costs over two locations

480
00:23:56,592 --> 00:24:01,595
so that the entities combine
to create higher margins.

481
00:24:01,597 --> 00:24:03,764
Now, the cost outlay,
it's gonna be minimal

482
00:24:03,766 --> 00:24:05,888
because Mac's bar just
need a couple touch-ups.

483
00:24:05,891 --> 00:24:07,401
It doesn't need a full overhaul.

484
00:24:07,403 --> 00:24:09,070
Not to mention,

485
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:13,339
the money that we can save
by split-focus marketing.

486
00:24:15,644 --> 00:24:19,813
I call it "Molly's North."

487
00:24:22,818 --> 00:24:23,951
Hmm.

488
00:24:27,956 --> 00:24:29,522
We'll think about it.

489
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:32,641
That's all I ask.

490
00:24:42,504 --> 00:24:46,538
Hey, it's not a done
deal yet, but, uh...

491
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,608
- I think I got them.
- Oh, my...

492
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,843
Brian, thanks...

493
00:24:50,845 --> 00:24:52,678
Yeah.

494
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,047
Hey.

495
00:24:59,954 --> 00:25:01,520
Uh...

496
00:25:01,522 --> 00:25:03,021
Tell your dad not to

497
00:25:03,023 --> 00:25:05,690
sell anything until I close it.

498
00:25:05,692 --> 00:25:07,559
- Okay?
- Okay.

499
00:25:07,561 --> 00:25:09,361
- Okay. Okay.
- All right.

500
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:20,371
Well, uh...

501
00:25:20,373 --> 00:25:22,184
I'm on probation at work.

502
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:24,876
They're saying that my attitude

503
00:25:24,878 --> 00:25:26,289
is a red flag for them.

504
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:29,681
I... I don't even know what that means.

505
00:25:29,683 --> 00:25:32,651
Uh, look. Yeah...

506
00:25:32,653 --> 00:25:34,552
Um...

507
00:25:34,554 --> 00:25:36,754
If... if Matt couldn't help me before

508
00:25:36,756 --> 00:25:38,689
I sure could use his help right now...

509
00:25:38,691 --> 00:25:40,708
- Are you kidding me?
- No, no, I... I...

510
00:25:40,711 --> 00:25:42,026
- I didn't.
- I told you

511
00:25:42,028 --> 00:25:43,694
that Matt was out of
politics and you still go

512
00:25:43,696 --> 00:25:45,204
to some alderman and
throw his name around?

513
00:25:45,206 --> 00:25:46,459
- No, sweetheart...
- No, Pop, no.

514
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:47,508
You don't listen.

515
00:25:47,511 --> 00:25:49,086
You walk yourself into these problem.

516
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,167
You don't care whose name you use

517
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:51,258
or who says, "No."

518
00:25:51,261 --> 00:25:52,531
It's all a fair game as long as

519
00:25:52,534 --> 00:25:54,344
Ramon Dawson is gets what he wants

520
00:25:54,347 --> 00:25:56,125
- No, I...
- No, I'm not playing around.

521
00:25:56,128 --> 00:25:58,841
You only think about
yourself and I'm sick of it.

522
00:26:11,022 --> 00:26:13,456
Okay.

523
00:26:17,862 --> 00:26:20,029
I understand.

524
00:26:20,031 --> 00:26:22,865
You're right.

525
00:26:22,867 --> 00:26:24,734
I, um...

526
00:26:24,736 --> 00:26:26,769
I'm sorry.

527
00:26:26,771 --> 00:26:28,257
Again.

528
00:26:48,927 --> 00:26:50,393
Are you Stella Kidd?

529
00:26:50,395 --> 00:26:51,666
Uh, that's me, yeah.

530
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:52,779
Topher.

531
00:26:52,782 --> 00:26:56,232
Let me show you where
you'll be hanging your hat.

532
00:26:56,234 --> 00:26:59,302
Main thing to know is
they monitor Internet use.

533
00:26:59,304 --> 00:27:02,405
I found that out the hard way.

534
00:27:02,407 --> 00:27:04,974
Let's see, we have morning
meetings Monday, Wednesday,

535
00:27:04,976 --> 00:27:06,893
and Friday to touch
base on talking points,

536
00:27:06,896 --> 00:27:09,612
key messages, that type of thing.

537
00:27:09,614 --> 00:27:12,181
This is you.

538
00:27:12,183 --> 00:27:15,150
Okay.

539
00:27:15,152 --> 00:27:17,659
And I should warn you,
today's there's a, uh...

540
00:27:17,662 --> 00:27:18,988
You the new girl?

541
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,622
- Stella, yeah, that's me.
- Great.

542
00:27:20,624 --> 00:27:22,958
Come with me.

543
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,926
Chief Huffhines, what's your name again?

544
00:27:24,928 --> 00:27:26,928
- Stella Kidd.
- Kidd, like "kid?"

545
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,333
Well, yeah, two Ds.

546
00:27:28,336 --> 00:27:30,366
Yeah, you're here to talk
about how good the CFD

547
00:27:30,368 --> 00:27:32,307
is with minorities,
women, that sort of thing.

548
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,335
Yeah, about that...

549
00:27:33,337 --> 00:27:34,877
Now, don't lay it on too thick,

550
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,873
but sell it, you know what I mean?

551
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:40,509
Is that how you're gonna wear your hair?

552
00:27:40,511 --> 00:27:45,146
- What?
- Down is better.

553
00:27:49,185 --> 00:27:52,020
Yeah, great.

554
00:27:52,022 --> 00:27:54,389
Here we go.

555
00:27:59,271 --> 00:28:01,529
Gentlemen, ladies...

556
00:28:01,531 --> 00:28:03,697
Thanks for allowing us the opportunity

557
00:28:03,699 --> 00:28:05,400
to set the record straight

558
00:28:05,402 --> 00:28:07,893
with regards to
personnel here at the CFD.

559
00:28:07,896 --> 00:28:10,237
This is Stella Kidd,

560
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:13,206
a distinguished firefighter
with many years of service

561
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:14,575
under her belt.

562
00:28:14,577 --> 00:28:16,176
She is eager to talk to you today

563
00:28:16,178 --> 00:28:18,012
about the achievements we've made

564
00:28:18,014 --> 00:28:20,510
with regards to minorities and gender

565
00:28:20,513 --> 00:28:24,018
under Fire Commissioner Jankowski.

566
00:28:33,661 --> 00:28:36,247
Uh

567
00:28:47,575 --> 00:28:50,042
We never stopped for ice
cream on my last truck.

568
00:28:50,044 --> 00:28:51,526
We did get slushies once.

569
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,178
I like cola and cherry mix.

570
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,546
Fascinating.

571
00:28:54,548 --> 00:28:56,247
Hey, what's that?

572
00:28:56,249 --> 00:28:57,515
- Ta-da!
- Ah.

573
00:28:57,517 --> 00:28:59,217
Whoa, that's a Weber Grill.

574
00:28:59,219 --> 00:29:00,788
We were a little under
with the petty cash fund

575
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:03,055
but this was the best
one so I just went for it.

576
00:29:03,057 --> 00:29:06,257
It's my gift to 51 for
making me feel so welcome.

577
00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:07,625
Forget it.

578
00:29:07,627 --> 00:29:09,849
We'll all chip in,
that's how we do things.

579
00:29:09,852 --> 00:29:11,185
I'll go get the tool box.

580
00:29:11,188 --> 00:29:13,465
The lid goes on top.

581
00:29:15,102 --> 00:29:17,068
So, uh, Manfredi.

582
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,224
Captain.

583
00:29:18,227 --> 00:29:20,270
Where were you before 51?

584
00:29:20,273 --> 00:29:21,940
Let's see, uh...

585
00:29:21,943 --> 00:29:24,441
Right before I was at 33.

586
00:29:24,443 --> 00:29:26,243
Then before that

587
00:29:26,245 --> 00:29:30,081
74, 59, 12, 41.

588
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:32,116
Wow, all over.

589
00:29:32,118 --> 00:29:34,073
I just go where the
transfer paper tells me.

590
00:29:34,076 --> 00:29:35,419
I'll bet.

591
00:29:35,421 --> 00:29:37,604
I got this cop friend over at CPD.

592
00:29:37,607 --> 00:29:39,656
He's got this uncle...

593
00:29:39,658 --> 00:29:41,737
bumps him to the best districts.

594
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,127
Totally hooks him up.

595
00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:46,130
Just signs the transfer
forms and phisssh.

596
00:29:46,132 --> 00:29:49,566
Kyle is set up. High living.

597
00:29:49,568 --> 00:29:53,170
I don't have an uncle like that.

598
00:29:53,172 --> 00:29:56,305
Otis, radio me if we get a call.

599
00:29:56,307 --> 00:29:58,608
Herrmann and I gonna run an errand.

600
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,777
- All right, yeah.
- You got it, Cap.

601
00:30:06,584 --> 00:30:07,841
- Hey.
- Oh.

602
00:30:07,844 --> 00:30:10,263
Is that Christopher
Herrmann I see before me?

603
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,121
- Oh.
- Hey, Demetra.

604
00:30:12,123 --> 00:30:14,190
- How are you?
- Oh, wonderful.

605
00:30:14,192 --> 00:30:15,625
Do you know that it was

606
00:30:15,627 --> 00:30:17,193
Christopher's wonderful wife Cindy

607
00:30:17,195 --> 00:30:18,461
that helped me get this job?

608
00:30:18,463 --> 00:30:19,828
We went to Notre Dame together.

609
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,430
I had heard that, yeah.

610
00:30:21,432 --> 00:30:22,932
Cindy's always bragging about you.

611
00:30:22,935 --> 00:30:24,667
Oh. What can I do for you?

612
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:27,502
Well, uh, we had a
firefighter transferred

613
00:30:27,505 --> 00:30:29,772
to Public Relations out of Firehouse 51.

614
00:30:29,774 --> 00:30:32,107
I was just wondering if we
can see the transfer order?

615
00:30:32,109 --> 00:30:35,010
Um, what was the firefighter's name?

616
00:30:35,013 --> 00:30:36,513
Stella Kidd.

617
00:30:39,684 --> 00:30:42,484
Give me one minute.

618
00:30:42,486 --> 00:30:44,686
I see why you brought me along.

619
00:30:44,688 --> 00:30:46,146
Go Irish.

620
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:49,357
- Here we go.
- Thanks.

621
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:51,059
Sure.

622
00:30:52,229 --> 00:30:53,695
Chief Mullins?

623
00:30:53,697 --> 00:30:55,197
Is that that by-the-book Chief

624
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:56,401
that gave you your promotion?

625
00:30:56,404 --> 00:30:57,832
- Yeah.
- Huh.

626
00:30:57,834 --> 00:31:01,069
He spent time around 51.
He's seen Kidd in action.

627
00:31:01,071 --> 00:31:03,237
Might be why he made the call.

628
00:31:08,878 --> 00:31:10,644
Are you sure about this?

629
00:31:10,646 --> 00:31:12,115
Because he didn't seem to keen

630
00:31:12,118 --> 00:31:15,249
on having his decision
making questioned.

631
00:31:18,588 --> 00:31:20,588
Captain Casey.

632
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,256
Chief.

633
00:31:22,258 --> 00:31:24,122
Can I help you with something?

634
00:31:37,372 --> 00:31:40,240
Hope.

635
00:31:40,242 --> 00:31:42,505
Mind stepping in here please?

636
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,347
Of course.

637
00:31:49,785 --> 00:31:51,417
Captain Casey has something

638
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:53,586
he would like to discuss with you.

639
00:31:53,588 --> 00:31:56,689
Sure.

640
00:31:56,691 --> 00:31:59,346
Here's the transfer
order moving Stella Kidd

641
00:31:59,349 --> 00:32:00,760
from Firehouse 51

642
00:32:00,762 --> 00:32:02,595
to the Public Relations department.

643
00:32:02,597 --> 00:32:05,154
It was signed by Chief Mullins.

644
00:32:07,769 --> 00:32:09,401
Okay?

645
00:32:09,404 --> 00:32:11,287
Only this isn't his signature.

646
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:15,651
See how the "M" tilts to the right

647
00:32:15,654 --> 00:32:18,543
and the "S" has a flourish.

648
00:32:18,545 --> 00:32:21,446
That's not the way I sign my name.

649
00:32:21,448 --> 00:32:23,448
This is.

650
00:32:26,754 --> 00:32:28,387
However...

651
00:32:28,389 --> 00:32:29,921
Here's a list you wrote to Connie

652
00:32:29,923 --> 00:32:32,157
about the supplies
and maintenance closet.

653
00:32:33,294 --> 00:32:35,294
See the "M" and the "S".

654
00:32:39,266 --> 00:32:41,299
I can see it.

655
00:32:41,301 --> 00:32:43,968
I mean, I could see how...

656
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:46,470
That...

657
00:32:46,472 --> 00:32:48,893
Actually, yes, I should
have said something sooner,

658
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,783
but Connie...

659
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:57,315
I...

660
00:32:57,317 --> 00:33:00,685
I just didn't know who to come
to about something like this.

661
00:33:04,138 --> 00:33:07,205
If you could just let me
explain before you judge me.

662
00:33:11,831 --> 00:33:14,764
What happened is...

663
00:33:14,766 --> 00:33:17,835
I saw the posting on the job board,

664
00:33:17,837 --> 00:33:20,670
and I was actually trying to help.

665
00:33:20,672 --> 00:33:22,709
Because Stella, I mean,

666
00:33:22,712 --> 00:33:24,679
she's such a strong female firefighter,

667
00:33:24,682 --> 00:33:26,944
and I saw that Public Relations
was looking for somebody

668
00:33:26,946 --> 00:33:28,511
to be the face of firefighting...

669
00:33:28,513 --> 00:33:30,346
Stop.

670
00:33:36,855 --> 00:33:39,424
I'm gonna save everyone
here a lot of time.

671
00:33:43,194 --> 00:33:44,932
Empty your desk.

672
00:34:16,594 --> 00:34:19,471
I went ahead and sped this up for you.

673
00:34:27,905 --> 00:34:30,405
Mm-mm.

674
00:34:30,407 --> 00:34:32,607
I'll take those.

675
00:35:06,916 --> 00:35:09,117
I am so, so, so sorry, Sylvie.

676
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,286
I really thought that I
was doing the right thing.

677
00:35:11,288 --> 00:35:13,439
I mean, women get a raw
deal in the fire department,

678
00:35:13,442 --> 00:35:14,688
you know that.

679
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,023
And here I was trying
to do something about it,

680
00:35:16,025 --> 00:35:17,623
trying to actually make a difference,

681
00:35:17,626 --> 00:35:19,960
and they twisted everything that I did.

682
00:35:19,962 --> 00:35:22,441
Sylvie. You know me.

683
00:35:22,444 --> 00:35:25,011
You know that this was blown
completely out of proportion.

684
00:35:25,014 --> 00:35:26,800
I mean, I really think

685
00:35:26,802 --> 00:35:28,935
that Connie was trying to
sabotage me from the start

686
00:35:28,937 --> 00:35:30,803
- if I'm being honest.
- How could you do this?

687
00:35:30,806 --> 00:35:32,605
You almost ruined everything
that I have worked for

688
00:35:32,607 --> 00:35:34,316
- here in Chicago.
- That's what I'm saying.

689
00:35:34,318 --> 00:35:35,542
- They made it look like...
- These people

690
00:35:35,544 --> 00:35:37,225
mean the world to me, Hope.

691
00:35:37,228 --> 00:35:39,546
These friends that I've made,
these friendships I've earned,

692
00:35:39,548 --> 00:35:41,782
they are the best, most
important relationships

693
00:35:41,784 --> 00:35:43,984
I've ever had, and you attacked them.

694
00:35:43,986 --> 00:35:45,652
- That's not at all what...
- Hope.

695
00:35:45,654 --> 00:35:47,932
You had a chance to
have an incredible life

696
00:35:47,935 --> 00:35:50,409
with incredible friends,
working at the best firehouse

697
00:35:50,412 --> 00:35:52,124
in the city. That's a fact.

698
00:35:52,126 --> 00:35:54,227
And you blew it.

699
00:35:54,229 --> 00:35:57,347
So take your excuses, take
your lies, take your drama,

700
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,832
and take it all back to Fowlerton.

701
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:03,818
Sylvie.

702
00:36:18,686 --> 00:36:21,753
Hey, Mac, right?

703
00:36:21,755 --> 00:36:25,591
We're the owners of
Molly's bar, and, uh...

704
00:36:25,593 --> 00:36:27,654
We'd like to make you a proposal.

705
00:36:39,873 --> 00:36:41,456
- Hey.
- Hey.

706
00:36:41,459 --> 00:36:42,941
We get to carpool again.

707
00:36:42,943 --> 00:36:44,581
I mean, we live together.

708
00:36:44,584 --> 00:36:46,211
We see each other all the time.

709
00:36:46,213 --> 00:36:48,679
Yeah, but still, I like to
see you at the firehouse too.

710
00:36:48,681 --> 00:36:50,681
- Right.
- No, serious.

711
00:36:50,683 --> 00:36:53,117
You... bring a light to it.

712
00:36:57,189 --> 00:36:59,724
And an odor.

713
00:36:59,726 --> 00:37:03,093
I know.

714
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:05,796
Kid who makes fun of
girl on the playground

715
00:37:05,798 --> 00:37:08,065
- actually really likes her.
- Mmhmm.

716
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:11,201
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

717
00:37:11,203 --> 00:37:12,736
- Yeah.
- Have you been there?

718
00:37:12,738 --> 00:37:14,398
- Yeah.
- It's good?

719
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:15,886
No, it's really good. We went last...

720
00:37:15,889 --> 00:37:17,995
Hey, there she is!

721
00:37:17,998 --> 00:37:20,651
- Hey!
- Welcome back, Kidd.

722
00:37:20,654 --> 00:37:23,354
You guys were jostling each
other for my locker already.

723
00:37:23,357 --> 00:37:24,568
- Admit it.
- Cruz was.

724
00:37:24,571 --> 00:37:26,249
- I said that was tacky.
- What?

725
00:37:26,251 --> 00:37:28,084
It has the best hinges.

726
00:37:28,086 --> 00:37:30,589
God, you guys.

727
00:37:30,592 --> 00:37:32,422
- What?
- Stop.

728
00:37:32,424 --> 00:37:33,923
Because you got the biggest hinges!

729
00:37:33,925 --> 00:37:35,992
Stop it!

730
00:37:40,098 --> 00:37:42,431
Okay, before I begin...

731
00:37:42,433 --> 00:37:45,628
Just want to say a big
welcome back to Stella Kidd

732
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:47,937
from her short stint of
smiling at the camera.

733
00:37:53,644 --> 00:37:56,245
All right!

734
00:37:57,415 --> 00:37:59,147
It's good to have you
firefighting again.

735
00:37:59,149 --> 00:38:00,982
It's where you belong.

736
00:38:00,984 --> 00:38:04,042
- Thank you, Chief.
- Okay, today's assignments.

737
00:38:04,045 --> 00:38:06,432
- Chief.
- Yes, Sylvie?

738
00:38:06,435 --> 00:38:09,425
I'd like to say a word if that's okay.

739
00:38:09,427 --> 00:38:11,259
Of course.

740
00:38:16,033 --> 00:38:20,435
I just want to say that for
my part in bringing my friend,

741
00:38:20,437 --> 00:38:22,304
my former friend...

742
00:38:22,306 --> 00:38:25,140
to Firehouse 51...

743
00:38:25,142 --> 00:38:27,976
I am truly sorry.

744
00:38:27,978 --> 00:38:29,945
This place is special to me,

745
00:38:29,947 --> 00:38:33,034
and I would never knowingly
or willingly do anything

746
00:38:33,037 --> 00:38:36,784
to jeopardize what it
is that we have here.

747
00:38:36,786 --> 00:38:38,486
I love all of you,

748
00:38:38,488 --> 00:38:41,021
and I feel terrible about what happened.

749
00:38:51,734 --> 00:38:53,662
Ambulance 61,

750
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,632
- Man Down From Unknown Causes,
- Hey, that's us.

751
00:38:55,635 --> 00:38:57,904
33 North Wabash, El Platform.

752
00:39:24,732 --> 00:39:26,199
Get down on the ground!

753
00:39:26,201 --> 00:39:27,934
Taser him! Taser him! Taser him!

754
00:39:27,936 --> 00:39:30,003
Move along.

755
00:39:30,005 --> 00:39:32,618
- Hey, hey, what happened?
- A guy starts screaming

756
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:34,801
at this woman for no reason,
brandishing a big-ass knife.

757
00:39:34,803 --> 00:39:36,190
Guy follows her, yelling at her,

758
00:39:36,193 --> 00:39:37,376
spit flying out of his mouth.

759
00:39:37,378 --> 00:39:38,511
Guy standing next to
me just went up to him

760
00:39:38,513 --> 00:39:39,779
and said, "That's enough."

761
00:39:39,781 --> 00:39:41,547
That's him right there.

762
00:39:41,549 --> 00:39:44,182
Crazy dude just stabbed
him like it was nothing.

763
00:39:44,184 --> 00:39:46,051
Paramedics! All clear!

764
00:39:50,892 --> 00:39:52,391
Let's go!

765
00:39:56,897 --> 00:39:58,543
Don't move, sir. Don't move.

766
00:39:58,546 --> 00:39:59,745
We got you.

767
00:39:59,748 --> 00:40:01,857
Ready? Okay, turn him.

768
00:40:04,805 --> 00:40:06,238
Dad.

769
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,274
Oh, my God.

770
00:40:16,203 --> 00:40:20,543

1
00:00:00,609 --> 00:00:02,277
I just found this on the squad table!

2
00:00:02,366 --> 00:00:03,679
His name is Mr. Sprinkles.

3
00:00:03,727 --> 00:00:06,265
We think he would be a very
good firefighter mascot.

4
00:00:08,165 --> 00:00:10,688
You need anything, day or
night, 24/7, you call me.

5
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:14,027
<i>Girl tries to steal drugs,
maybe you're getting snowed.</i>

6
00:00:14,095 --> 00:00:15,781
<i>She's gone! She's not at the hospital,</i>

7
00:00:15,806 --> 00:00:17,109
<i>she's not at the apartment.</i>

8
00:00:17,134 --> 00:00:18,728
I know how you feel about
the way I'm handling this.

9
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:20,406
It doesn't matter how I feel.

10
00:00:20,802 --> 00:00:22,802
<i>You're gonna do whatever
you're gonna do anyway.</i>

11
00:00:22,871 --> 00:00:25,143
You know, there's that
stretch of Milwaukee Avenue

12
00:00:25,168 --> 00:00:26,619
<i>where I see teens in those encampments.</i>

13
00:00:26,643 --> 00:00:27,720
You know a girl named Bria?

14
00:00:27,744 --> 00:00:29,176
No, I don't think so.

15
00:01:04,313 --> 00:01:06,646
Hey.

16
00:01:07,283 --> 00:01:09,709
Hey, sorry. Go back to bed.

17
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,162
When'd you get in?

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,818
A while ago.

19
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,091
This about that girl?

20
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,226
Bria, yeah.

21
00:01:19,295 --> 00:01:22,296
I'm on her Facebook page.
She hasn't posted in days.

22
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:26,901
You gotta get some sleep, babe.

23
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:28,736
I will, I will, it's just...

24
00:01:28,805 --> 00:01:30,404
Tina said she didn't have any relatives

25
00:01:30,473 --> 00:01:33,841
who could care for her, but
this woman, Melinda Tripp,

26
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,743
she replied to some
post about a year ago

27
00:01:35,812 --> 00:01:39,647
and Bria replied back
calling her "Aunt Melinda."

28
00:01:39,716 --> 00:01:41,916
I think that's kind of weird.

29
00:01:46,756 --> 00:01:49,590
Would you be cool if Kidd
subbed for me tomorrow?

30
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:51,303
I mean, if it's gonna put you in a bind,
I'll suck it up,

31
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:54,284
but I really want to keep working this.

32
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:58,666
Well, I'm the captain, so
I can make that work, I guess.

33
00:01:58,735 --> 00:02:00,668
- Yeah.
- Great, thanks.

34
00:02:11,647 --> 00:02:13,948
Looks like
you're doing less fires

35
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,641
and more taking temperatures today?

36
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:17,785
Yeah, Casey called bright and early

37
00:02:17,854 --> 00:02:20,430
- to ask if I could sub for Dawson.
- Yeah?

38
00:02:20,477 --> 00:02:22,281
Yeah, apparently, she's beating herself up

39
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:23,791
about this missing girl.

40
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,227
Yeah, she has a tendency to do that.

41
00:02:26,295 --> 00:02:27,839
Yeah.

42
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:33,134
You guys smell that?

43
00:02:33,202 --> 00:02:35,160
That's never a good way
to start a conversation.

44
00:02:35,185 --> 00:02:37,252
Something is ripe!

45
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,539
I don't smell anything.

46
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:39,855
Well, you're blind,

47
00:02:39,896 --> 00:02:41,758
or whatever the smell
equivalent of that is.

48
00:02:41,811 --> 00:02:43,175
Curiously enough,

49
00:02:43,238 --> 00:02:46,386
the female nostril holds 1,000
times the smell receptors

50
00:02:46,425 --> 00:02:47,681
as their male counterparts.

51
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,316
That sounds made up.

52
00:02:49,385 --> 00:02:50,851
It was on the internet.

53
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,054
Maybe it's the gym bag that
Capp keeps under his bed.

54
00:02:54,123 --> 00:02:55,768
I don't think he's aired
that thing out in years.

55
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:58,225
Saw him leave with it yesterday.

56
00:02:58,294 --> 00:03:00,384
That's his overnight bag.
I'm talking about the bag

57
00:03:00,455 --> 00:03:02,429
under his bed he calls his "go bag."

58
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:07,392
<i>Truck 81, Squad 3, Ambulance 61,</i>

59
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:10,771
<i>woman caught in machine.

60
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,961
Yo, watch your backs.

Coming through! Fire
Department! Step back, please!

62
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,944
- Step back! Step back!
- Excuse us! Excuse us!

63
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,415
- Thank you!
- Back, back, come on!

64
00:03:40,478 --> 00:03:42,036
- I'm late! Let's go!
- Help me!

65
00:03:42,104 --> 00:03:44,915
- Come on!
- Please, help me!

66
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:48,413
Hold on, ma'am!

67
00:03:48,485 --> 00:03:51,419
It hurts! Please, someone help me!

00:04:05,194 --> 00:04:09,063
Help me, please! Get me out of here!

72
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:11,999
Knock the rest of this glass
off, cut through here.

73
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:13,816
Ma'am, you gotta stop moving!

74
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,569
- It hurts!
- We're working to get you out,

75
00:04:15,638 --> 00:04:17,003
you're making it worse for yourself!

76
00:04:17,027 --> 00:04:18,192
- It's killing me!
- Hey, can you

77
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,895
use your little glass
breaker on my section?

78
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,259
Hey, stop touching the glass,

79
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:22,791
shut up, and stand back!

80
00:04:22,892 --> 00:04:25,174
- Hey, cover your head with your jacket!
- What?

81
00:04:25,214 --> 00:04:28,049
I need you to cover your eyes.
We're gonna break the glass.

82
00:04:28,551 --> 00:04:31,085
- Herrmann, grab the cutters.
- Right, on it.

83
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:39,193
All right, Stella, get the morphine.

84
00:04:41,787 --> 00:04:43,194
I need you to hold still, okay?

85
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:44,233
- Okay.
- We've got you.

86
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,045
I'm gonna get you some
medication for the pain.

87
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:47,811
Please hurry up!

88
00:04:47,842 --> 00:04:49,186
Come on, let's go!

89
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,899
- All right, guys.
- Hey, I got a meeting!

90
00:04:52,341 --> 00:04:53,474
Come on!

91
00:04:54,603 --> 00:04:55,594
- Let me out!
- Help me!

92
00:04:55,619 --> 00:04:59,146
Hey, do that again,
and we'll leave you in there all day!

93
00:05:23,606 --> 00:05:25,096
Okay, Brett, Kidd!

94
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:28,869
Okay.

95
00:05:34,592 --> 00:05:36,191
All right, guys.

96
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,199
Please.

97
00:05:41,657 --> 00:05:42,879
Got the leg.

98
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:44,692
Watch her head.

99
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,262
All right.

100
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:54,668
Give us a few minutes to
get this glass swept up.

101
00:05:55,073 --> 00:05:57,526
Hey! Hey!

102
00:05:57,578 --> 00:05:59,712
Let me out!

103
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,611
What the...

104
00:06:10,728 --> 00:06:13,658
What the... come on!

105
00:06:17,593 --> 00:06:19,026
Hey.

106
00:06:20,696 --> 00:06:22,062
Yeah, what do you need, buddy?

107
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,645
You were the guy
with the woman last night

108
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:25,299
under the 18th Street bridge?

109
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:27,988
You were showing that
picture of the girl around?

110
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:29,275
Yeah.

111
00:06:29,328 --> 00:06:31,328
That was me.

112
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,093
Yeah, I know her.

113
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:34,608
Do you?

114
00:06:34,677 --> 00:06:37,244
Well, I... I went to school with her.

115
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,812
Payton Grizzlies.

116
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:40,247
You did?

117
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,883
Yeah, um, she hangs out with these kids

118
00:06:42,952 --> 00:06:46,420
behind this small market
on 16th and Kenilworth.

119
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:48,892
Well, at least, she used to.

120
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,853
Why the hell didn't you
tell me that last night?

121
00:06:51,923 --> 00:06:54,795
Come on, man. You looked like cops.

122
00:06:56,665 --> 00:06:58,365
Can you help me out a bit?

123
00:07:10,982 --> 00:07:12,281
Hey.

124
00:07:15,284 --> 00:07:18,652
You and Gabby were walking
around Skid Row last night?

125
00:07:18,728 --> 00:07:20,594
Yeah, I thought she told you.

126
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:22,300
Well, she told me you
were out looking for Bria.

127
00:07:22,324 --> 00:07:23,657
I didn't know to what extent.

128
00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:25,426
Well, it was my suggestion.

129
00:07:25,494 --> 00:07:29,296
We didn't find her, so...
I guess it was a bad idea.

130
00:07:31,343 --> 00:07:33,677
Okay. Thanks.

131
00:07:33,794 --> 00:07:35,760
Dawson probably just
doesn't want you worried.

132
00:07:35,813 --> 00:07:38,179
She knows how you feel about...

133
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:40,617
About what?

134
00:07:40,843 --> 00:07:42,876
Getting too close to victims.

135
00:07:52,788 --> 00:07:54,221
Ooh...

136
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,623
Yeah. Definitely smell it now!

137
00:07:56,692 --> 00:08:00,527
Yeah, what's fair is foul,
and what's foul is fair.

138
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:02,496
What does that mean?

139
00:08:02,573 --> 00:08:04,306
It's stinky!

140
00:08:04,366 --> 00:08:08,302
Hey, Capp, did you empty your gobag?

141
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,471
My guess is that it's the paramedics.

142
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:12,673
I mean, who knows what
they keep in their bunks.

143
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:15,426
Because they're women?

144
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,745
- Maybe.
- That deserves no reply.

145
00:08:17,814 --> 00:08:19,043
You know what it could be?

146
00:08:19,153 --> 00:08:21,248
First shift is trying
to pull a joke on us.

147
00:08:21,317 --> 00:08:22,961
There's all kinds of novelty
gags you can buy.

148
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:25,052
Poo powder, barf mix.

149
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:26,550
Hey, Captain!

150
00:08:26,642 --> 00:08:29,643
Who on first shift is most
likely to want to punk us?

151
00:08:29,782 --> 00:08:32,383
- Smolik? Freeman?
- What?

152
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,091
The smell... we think it might
be first shift messing with us.

153
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:37,890
- I don't have time for this.
- Sorry, Cap.

154
00:08:37,915 --> 00:08:39,444
Everyone go through
your personal belongings

155
00:08:39,468 --> 00:08:41,502
until the source of
the smell is located.

156
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,403
Someone left something rotten in a bag

157
00:08:43,472 --> 00:08:46,373
or shelf or footlocker, so find it.

158
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:57,951
Hey.

159
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,355
Hey, I found a Melinda Tripp
listed in Joliet.

160
00:09:01,423 --> 00:09:03,624
I think from her Facebook
she might be Bria's aunt.

161
00:09:03,697 --> 00:09:04,835
I'm on my way there now,

162
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:06,515
I figured it was worth the
gas money to check it out.

163
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:08,128
Great, I got a lead too.

164
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:10,364
Some kid who went to
Bria's school said that

165
00:09:10,432 --> 00:09:12,177
her group used to hang
out behind some market.

166
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:13,867
<i>I don't know if the kid's shining me on,</i>

167
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:16,036
<i>but I'll look into it
and see what I can find out.</i>

168
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:17,971
- Okay, keep me posted.
<i>- Will do.</i>

169
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,107
Dawson.

170
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,167
Have you talked to Casey?

171
00:09:25,318 --> 00:09:27,518
Why?

172
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,082
He's worried about you.

173
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:33,919
Um, okay, I'll call him later.

174
00:09:34,037 --> 00:09:35,792
- Catch him up.
<i>- Okay.</i>

175
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,177
Hey!

176
00:09:50,594 --> 00:09:52,914
- Did you talk to Dawson?
- Nope.

177
00:09:53,658 --> 00:09:55,758
Okay, well, she's in
Joliet, checking up on...

178
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:56,937
Joliet?

179
00:09:56,975 --> 00:10:00,016
Yeah, something about
an aunt on Facebook?

180
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,700
What is she doing?

181
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,970
I'm not trying to get
in the middle of anything.

182
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,371
I just want to find this girl.

183
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,340
I'm here to help!

184
00:10:10,244 --> 00:10:12,465
I'm gonna roll squad by that...

185
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:15,027
by that market on Kenilworth,
see if I can learn anything.

186
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:17,382
Radios are on if we catch a
call, double time it there?

187
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,784
- Cool?
- Yeah, do it.

188
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,777
Okay.

189
00:10:21,046 --> 00:10:23,295
Squad 3, let's go for a ride!

190
00:10:35,838 --> 00:10:39,070
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Hey, you want me to come too?

191
00:10:39,095 --> 00:10:40,115
No, I got this.

192
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,741
Hey, get me a Laffy Taffy.

193
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:01,259
Hey, need to talk to you.

194
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,630
Hey! Just a... just a sec!

195
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,265
Wait!

196
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:15,707
It's about a girl named Bria!

197
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:48,206
Give it back.

198
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:50,375
It's mine.

199
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:56,147
Tell me what you know about Bria.

200
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,317
- Come on, man.
- Trying to help her.

201
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,654
She was gonna go see her dad.

202
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:04,200
They have him locked up at one of these

203
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,491
mandatory rehab facilities or something.

204
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,327
I told her don't do it,
but she's stubborn.

205
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,363
- That I know.
- She said she'd come back

206
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,164
after she saw him, but she didn't.

207
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,233
Cops maybe got her.

208
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:16,746
I don't know. This whole thing sucks.

209
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,871
She shouldn't have to
be dealing with this.

210
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:32,083
If you find her, tell her
we're all worried about her.

211
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:33,919
I will.

212
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,563
I think it's gotten stronger.

213
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:46,865
Yeah.

214
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,366
I think you're right.

215
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,201
I'm starting to get a migraine.

216
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:51,803
Well, we can't sleep in here tonight.

217
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:54,940
Could be black mold.
It's a total teardown, if so.

218
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,770
I saw it on "Fixer Upper,"
it's a health hazard.

219
00:12:56,794 --> 00:12:58,621
You gotta rip apart the
entire building, start over.

220
00:12:58,645 --> 00:12:59,878
Okay.

221
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,313
Let's get these bunks out of here.

222
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:02,625
We'll move them into the hallway

223
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:03,722
or put them in the briefing room.

224
00:13:03,746 --> 00:13:05,650
Good idea, then if the hallways smells,

225
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,196
we'll know it's the mattresses,
if it doesn't,

226
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,586
it's definitely something in here.

227
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,922
Black mold! Tellin' ya!

228
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,435
Hang on.

229
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,333
- I gotta...
- Let it go.

230
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:24,102
- Let it go.
- You had it from the bottom.

231
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:26,271
Don't grab it from the top.

232
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,343
- Chief.
- Yeah?

233
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:32,978
Can I borrow the desk Hope was using?

234
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:35,166
I gotta finish these call logs,
and the bunkroom is...

235
00:13:35,236 --> 00:13:36,802
Be my guest.

236
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:42,287
You know, I've been thinking,
um, since you made captain,

237
00:13:42,356 --> 00:13:44,189
you should maybe take the blue office.

238
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:45,757
Move out of the bunkroom.

239
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,971
I've been using it for storage
since Patterson was here.

240
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:51,029
We could easily clean it out,
set you up in there.

241
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:53,298
I noticed the extra 100 feet
the men have to go to

242
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:54,644
to complain about their problems.

243
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:57,102
Might as well be a mile.

244
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:01,667
They'll work out some of this
nonsense themselves, you know.

245
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,975
Sounds interesting, Chief.

246
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:09,180
<i>Ambulance 61, 3831 S. Lawndale,</i>

247
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:11,016
<i>woman down from unknown causes.</i>

248
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,486
So the way I do it is I find the vein,

249
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:16,287
occlude it with your thumb...

250
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,159
And push the blood upward
and out with your other finger.

251
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:21,049
And where the blood backflows to,

252
00:14:21,118 --> 00:14:22,772
that's the valve, that's
how you avoid hitting it.

253
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:24,322
- That's smart!
- Really?

254
00:14:24,347 --> 00:14:25,964
Dawson's always
telling me to eyeball it!

255
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,366
And that avoids sticking
your patient a million times!

256
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:29,868
That's what I've been saying.

257
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:32,266
Hey, your technique is deadon.

258
00:14:32,546 --> 00:14:34,679
You know what?
It is all kinds of awesome,

259
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:36,386
riding with you.
I mean, don't get me wrong,

260
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:40,861
I love me some Gabby, but
we click, like ruby slippers!

261
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:54,192
Hey, I got one!

262
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:57,195
Make the stretcher with a
little extra length

263
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:58,563
- at the foot end.
- Why?

264
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:00,451
So if you get an extra tall victim,

265
00:15:00,506 --> 00:15:01,811
you have room to cover their feet

266
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:03,501
so when you unload the stretcher

267
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,881
and you accidentally bump into him,

268
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,771
you don't get gunk all over your shirt.

269
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,940
That's a good one.

270
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,378
Someone call a paramedic?

271
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:15,847
- It's my mom!
- Show us where.

272
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,783
She's in the basement,
and she won't get up!

273
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:21,186
I tried going down there,
but I couldn't breathe,

274
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,354
and Mom told me
if there's ever an accident

275
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:26,077
- to call 911.
- You did great.

276
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:31,529
Will you stay over there
until we come and get you?

277
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,531
Okay.

278
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,799
What do you think?

279
00:15:34,876 --> 00:15:36,562
Exhaust pipe from the dryer disconnects

280
00:15:36,609 --> 00:15:38,468
could flood the whole
basement with carbon monoxide.

281
00:15:38,492 --> 00:15:41,406
- We gotta get Mom out.
- Okay. Hold our breath.

282
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:42,819
I'll get her arms, you get her legs.

283
00:15:42,843 --> 00:15:44,976
We're in and out, 20 seconds.

284
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:46,311
Okay.

285
00:16:00,828 --> 00:16:02,393
Chloramine.

286
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:18,910
Okay.

287
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,678
Her pulse is weak.

288
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:22,914
Mom, Mom, no!

289
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,482
- What's your name, honey?
- Gemma.

290
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:25,941
Gemma, can you do us a favor?

291
00:16:26,002 --> 00:16:27,602
Will you grab us some towels and a robe?

292
00:16:27,628 --> 00:16:30,255
- We're gonna take care of your mom.
- Okay.

293
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,263
61 to Main, we need you to
roll out a Hazmat unit

294
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,131
to 1100 South Lawndale Avenue.

295
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,800
We got a chemical spill in the basement.

296
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:45,036
<i>Copy that, 61. We'll notify Hazmat.</i>

297
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:51,042
- Great job, Gemma.
- Thank you.

298
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:52,610
Okay.

299
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:57,115
- There you go.
- Okay.

300
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,502
There we go.

301
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,708
Okay.

302
00:17:10,664 --> 00:17:12,530
Here we go.

303
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,209
That should be fine.

304
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:26,744
How you feeling?

305
00:17:26,832 --> 00:17:28,267
I still don't know what happened.

306
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:30,266
Well, you can't mix
chlorine and ammonia.

307
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:33,088
They form chloramine,
which produces a toxic gas.

308
00:17:33,134 --> 00:17:35,653
I had no idea, I was just
trying to clean the floor.

309
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,355
Well, now you know.

310
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,758
The air is clearing,

311
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:42,594
we're ventilating out the back windows.

312
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:45,163
Ambient air quality should
stabilize in 20 minutes.

313
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:47,332
Well, let's call it an hour to be safe.

314
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,000
I will never do that again.

315
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,502
No problem, ma'am.
Just glad you're okay.

316
00:17:58,144 --> 00:18:00,044
Um, we're gonna route you to
Chicago Med,

317
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:02,280
just to be doubly sure, and
Gemma's gonna ride with us.

318
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:03,681
Thank you.

319
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:07,752
You wanna drive?

320
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,457
- Stella?
- What? Yes!

321
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,873
Yep!

322
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,988
Okay.

323
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,936
Yep.

324
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:27,472
- Still here.
- It's a total teardown.

325
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,307
Chip and JoJo would agree with me.

326
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:31,242
You know what? Trudy and I

327
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:33,811
have been turning the back
guest room into an Airbnb...

328
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,880
Well, thinking about it.

329
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,649
In preparation, I've been watching

330
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,884
some DIY videos on plumbing.

331
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,060
This might be a mainline problem.

332
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:45,323
Do it yourself plumbing.
What could go wrong?

333
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:49,594
Pipe closet right on the
other side of that wall.

334
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,336
Smell worse in there to you?

335
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:00,104
I can't smell anything anymore.

336
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:02,173
It's like my nostrils just gave up.

337
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:04,509
Go get me the toolbox from 81.

338
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:06,277
Gladly.

339
00:19:59,312 --> 00:20:00,912
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

340
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:03,419
We're firefighters over at House 51.

341
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,957
You have a patient here
that I'd like to visit,

342
00:20:06,017 --> 00:20:07,717
if that's possible.

343
00:20:07,801 --> 00:20:08,996
Pilar?

344
00:20:09,535 --> 00:20:12,497
- Pilar Valdez?
- You gotta be kidding me,

345
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:13,999
- Joe Cruz?
- Yeah!

346
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:15,597
I heard you was a firefighter.

347
00:20:15,621 --> 00:20:16,734
12 years running.

348
00:20:16,802 --> 00:20:18,335
Well, it looks like it suits you.

349
00:20:18,404 --> 00:20:20,536
- Keeps me on my toes.
- Well, you always had a way.

350
00:20:20,606 --> 00:20:23,207
- I don't mean to interrupt...
- Well, you did.

351
00:20:24,904 --> 00:20:26,937
Hey, Pilar,

352
00:20:27,006 --> 00:20:28,141
can you help out my lieutenant here?

353
00:20:28,165 --> 00:20:29,698
He just needs to see a patient.

354
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:31,275
And can I use your bathroom?

355
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:38,048
Fill out the second page
and sign the bottom.

356
00:20:38,117 --> 00:20:41,986
I can't believe this.
Joe Cruz walks into my clinic!

357
00:20:42,054 --> 00:20:43,954
Right on the cusp of Valentine's.

358
00:20:44,023 --> 00:20:46,423
It is great to see you.

359
00:21:08,447 --> 00:21:10,614
Mr. Jamison.

360
00:21:10,683 --> 00:21:13,784
I know you... you're the one
that came in with the paramedic

361
00:21:13,853 --> 00:21:16,320
when I...

362
00:21:16,689 --> 00:21:18,522
You were her boyfriend?

363
00:21:18,891 --> 00:21:21,292
Coworker. We...

364
00:21:21,672 --> 00:21:24,295
we work at the same firehouse.

365
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:32,803
I just wanted to stop by and
ask about your daughter, Bria.

366
00:21:33,246 --> 00:21:34,679
No one's been able to find her,

367
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,340
and I was hoping that you could help.

368
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:39,310
I know that she was planning
on coming to see you.

369
00:21:41,147 --> 00:21:43,293
No.

370
00:21:43,716 --> 00:21:46,254
No, she didn't come. Hey!

371
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:47,951
Hey, Warren!

372
00:21:49,577 --> 00:21:51,722
Hey, hush up in here.

373
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,324
Did my daughter come to see me?

374
00:21:53,392 --> 00:21:55,125
No.

375
00:21:56,495 --> 00:21:58,062
Hey, you stirring him up?

376
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,897
- No...
- If so, you gotta go.

377
00:21:59,965 --> 00:22:01,365
Thanks.

378
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:07,741
I messed up!

379
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,808
I messed up, and now
she's paying for it.

380
00:22:10,876 --> 00:22:13,010
How's that fair?

381
00:22:13,063 --> 00:22:15,029
We'll find her.

382
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:18,751
I haven't told her.

383
00:22:19,118 --> 00:22:21,018
I haven't told her it was my fault.

384
00:22:21,087 --> 00:22:24,088
I haven't told her that
I would do anything for her.

385
00:22:24,156 --> 00:22:27,476
I didn't have a chance,
and now she hates me!

386
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,460
I know, and I can't blame her, but...

387
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:36,567
I have to tell her that it's
not her fault, none of it!

388
00:22:41,006 --> 00:22:42,973
She doesn't hate you.

389
00:22:44,777 --> 00:22:48,045
And she did come to visit you.

390
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,570
I know how hard this is.

391
00:23:16,075 --> 00:23:18,087
You get clean...

392
00:23:18,944 --> 00:23:20,611
and we'll make sure to have her here

393
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:22,283
for when you walk out.

394
00:24:22,975 --> 00:24:25,065
What do you want?

395
00:24:26,178 --> 00:24:28,049
Um...

396
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,714
- are you Melinda Tripp?
- So?

397
00:24:30,783 --> 00:24:32,503
- I just wanted to ask...
- I paid my bills!

398
00:24:32,551 --> 00:24:34,994
No, no, no, I'm not a collector, um...

399
00:24:35,254 --> 00:24:38,355
I'm looking for your niece, Bria.

400
00:24:39,158 --> 00:24:41,058
You leave that girl alone!

401
00:24:41,126 --> 00:24:42,893
- Is she here?
- Leave her alone!

402
00:24:42,962 --> 00:24:46,793
Ma'am, I'm not the police,
I'm not a social worker, I'm...

403
00:24:47,227 --> 00:24:50,829
I'm a friend, and she's in trouble.

404
00:24:52,355 --> 00:24:53,521
What kind?

405
00:24:53,651 --> 00:24:56,548
Her father's in the hospital,
and he can't take care of her.

406
00:24:56,573 --> 00:24:57,573
Good!

407
00:24:57,864 --> 00:24:59,843
- She's better off without him.
- No, listen.

408
00:24:59,912 --> 00:25:01,245
Bria ran away.

409
00:25:01,313 --> 00:25:02,712
She's afraid to be in the foster system,

410
00:25:02,736 --> 00:25:05,070
and now she's disappeared.

411
00:25:05,284 --> 00:25:07,773
She's better off.

412
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,721
- Living on the streets?
- Safer that way!

413
00:25:12,525 --> 00:25:14,773
Won't end up like her mother.

414
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,184
Mother...

415
00:25:17,596 --> 00:25:19,830
He drove her to it, you know.

416
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:24,301
Chipped away, chipped away
at her every day.

417
00:25:28,507 --> 00:25:32,142
He didn't pull the trigger,
but he might as well have.

418
00:25:33,212 --> 00:25:35,579
Bria's mom killed herself?

419
00:25:39,752 --> 00:25:42,019
She's better off...

420
00:25:42,087 --> 00:25:44,388
Without him.

421
00:25:44,456 --> 00:25:47,224
Ma'am, please, what about Bria?

422
00:25:47,293 --> 00:25:50,058
She's alone! She's scared to death!

423
00:25:58,351 --> 00:25:59,694
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hey.

424
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,085
How goes it?

425
00:26:01,132 --> 00:26:02,231
<i>I found her aunt.</i>

426
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:04,133
I can see why she's not
listed as a guardian.

427
00:26:04,201 --> 00:26:06,858
She's... off.

428
00:26:07,138 --> 00:26:08,637
<i>Yeah?</i>

429
00:26:08,826 --> 00:26:12,107
Said her sister was driven
to suicide by Bria's dad.

430
00:26:14,078 --> 00:26:15,173
I was just with him.

431
00:26:15,189 --> 00:26:17,656
<i>Whatever he was in the past,
I have no idea,</i>

432
00:26:17,725 --> 00:26:20,760
but I know that he wants
to beat this for his daughter.

433
00:26:20,828 --> 00:26:23,262
Yeah, well, she's not in
Joliet, I can tell you that.

434
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:25,567
She was here. Maybe too scared

435
00:26:25,592 --> 00:26:26,810
to come in through the front door,

436
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:30,102
but she left him a note,
says she loves him.

437
00:26:33,374 --> 00:26:35,141
Okay.

438
00:26:35,209 --> 00:26:36,976
I'm on my way back.

439
00:26:37,045 --> 00:26:38,744
All right, drive safe.

440
00:26:48,385 --> 00:26:52,136
So you got your main line
and you got your water line,

441
00:26:52,221 --> 00:26:55,895
one goes to the sinks,
one goes from the toilets.

442
00:26:56,188 --> 00:26:58,255
Make sure you pick the right one.

443
00:26:58,324 --> 00:26:59,773
Already taken care of, Herrmann.

444
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:02,426
I replaced the seals, flushed the pipes,

445
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,193
we should be good to go.

446
00:27:07,963 --> 00:27:09,974
Then what are all these extra pieces?

447
00:27:17,371 --> 00:27:19,571
Is that smell gone?

448
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,306
I have no idea.

449
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:22,974
Found some tissues. All's good.

450
00:27:23,077 --> 00:27:26,411
All right, the smell's still
here. I can still smell it.

451
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,814
Yep, still gross.

452
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,437
Why are there greasy gaskets
out in my firehouse corridor?

453
00:27:32,492 --> 00:27:36,231
That's because Mr. Fixlt
over here, he decided to try

454
00:27:36,256 --> 00:27:38,824
and flush out the sewer line.

455
00:27:41,812 --> 00:27:45,280
Question two... who called headquarters

456
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:46,832
saying that they were a whistleblower

457
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,968
and that maybe we had
black mold here at 51?

458
00:27:54,975 --> 00:27:57,876
Hey, Chief, Stella and I just
got back from a call today,

459
00:27:57,945 --> 00:27:59,877
and the Hazmat unit was amazing.

460
00:27:59,947 --> 00:28:02,168
And see, there's this
lieutenant in that unit...

461
00:28:02,193 --> 00:28:04,030
I think the name on his sleeve was Zach.

462
00:28:04,055 --> 00:28:06,718
Definitely, definitely was Zach.

463
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,554
Anyway, I could call over there

464
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,222
and see if Zach could
stop by as a favor.

465
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:12,225
Which is a great idea!

466
00:28:16,734 --> 00:28:18,067
Okay, fine.

467
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,393
Hi! Hi, Zach, it's Sylvie Brett from 51.

468
00:28:29,494 --> 00:28:32,681
We're the paramedics who were
on your basement call today...

469
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,650
You do. Okay.

470
00:28:34,719 --> 00:28:38,153
Listen, we're having some...

471
00:28:38,222 --> 00:28:41,090
olfactory issues here at the firehouse,

472
00:28:41,158 --> 00:28:43,359
and I was wondering if...

473
00:28:43,427 --> 00:28:45,694
Ha. You would.

474
00:28:45,763 --> 00:28:48,197
Um, great. See you in a minute.

475
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,767
- He's headed over.
- Great!

476
00:28:51,836 --> 00:28:56,105
'Cause I am gonna ask him
out as soon as he gets here.

477
00:28:56,173 --> 00:28:58,574
It was my idea to call him.

478
00:28:58,643 --> 00:28:59,842
I was gonna ask him out.

479
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:02,278
Well, I already called dibs.

480
00:29:02,346 --> 00:29:04,212
Well, you don't just...
you don't just call dibs.

481
00:29:04,236 --> 00:29:06,181
Well, he was checking me out
on the call, so...

482
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,550
I think he was
checking me out, besides...

483
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:10,452
Brett, listen. I need this.

484
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:13,268
I have had zero luck in love this year.

485
00:29:13,326 --> 00:29:18,254
Zero! II live with a guy
who has firmly stuck me

486
00:29:18,332 --> 00:29:19,796
in the friend zone, so...

487
00:29:19,864 --> 00:29:22,131
Um, I need this too.

488
00:29:22,199 --> 00:29:24,900
I just broke up with Antonio again.

489
00:29:24,969 --> 00:29:29,682
And I would really like
to forget about him, so...

490
00:29:30,463 --> 00:29:33,463
Yeah, well, I'm not giving in.

491
00:29:33,944 --> 00:29:36,338
Neither am I.

492
00:29:37,048 --> 00:29:40,749
Well, you can take your ruby slippers

493
00:29:40,818 --> 00:29:43,231
and land a house on them.

494
00:29:44,989 --> 00:29:47,156
<i>Hey, Matt, I guess I missed you.</i>

495
00:29:47,224 --> 00:29:48,918
<i>Listen, I...</i>

496
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:51,600
<i>I, I know I've been distant lately,</i>

497
00:29:51,662 --> 00:29:54,325
<i>and that's my fault.</i>

498
00:29:54,665 --> 00:29:56,432
<i>And I'm sorry.</i>

499
00:29:56,492 --> 00:29:59,071
<i>I'll catch you up on
everything tonight, I promise.</i>

500
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,669
<i>I love you, babe.</i>

501
00:30:06,043 --> 00:30:08,023
<i>Hey, Matt, I guess I missed you.</i>

502
00:30:08,102 --> 00:30:09,902
<i>Listen, I...</i>

503
00:30:10,097 --> 00:30:12,430
<i>I, I know I've been distant lately,</i>

504
00:30:12,483 --> 00:30:14,516
<i>and that's my fault.</i>

505
00:30:14,585 --> 00:30:16,952
Thank you.

506
00:30:17,512 --> 00:30:19,274
Chief.

507
00:30:20,624 --> 00:30:22,224
I've been thinking.

508
00:30:24,128 --> 00:30:25,728
Come on in.

509
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:30,466
As soon as you get
out of touch with someone,

510
00:30:30,534 --> 00:30:34,436
you feel like you've distanced
yourself from their concern,

511
00:30:34,505 --> 00:30:36,916
their problems...

512
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:39,675
what were inches between
you can grow into miles.

513
00:30:42,346 --> 00:30:46,148
I been doing a little bit
too much of that lately.

514
00:30:46,217 --> 00:30:47,850
Distancing myself.

515
00:30:47,918 --> 00:30:50,185
So I don't want this
to come out the wrong way,

516
00:30:50,254 --> 00:30:52,187
and I really appreciate the offer,

517
00:30:52,256 --> 00:30:55,991
but, I think I'm gonna
stay in my old quarters

518
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,227
so I can be close to my men.

519
00:30:58,295 --> 00:31:00,195
Okay then.

520
00:31:00,264 --> 00:31:02,364
I'll admit I'm a little jealous.

521
00:31:02,441 --> 00:31:04,007
When I made Battalion Chief,

522
00:31:04,068 --> 00:31:06,168
I was very happy to get to
this end of the firehouse.

523
00:31:06,252 --> 00:31:09,720
No more snoring men,
no more coughs and sneezes

524
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,162
at 4:00 in the a.m. just as
I finally got my eyes closed.

525
00:31:13,608 --> 00:31:17,201
It was a place to come, shut my
door, and not be bothered.

526
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:23,485
But it turns out... sometimes
I miss being bothered.

527
00:31:25,356 --> 00:31:28,056
Sometimes I miss those
sneezes and snores.

528
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,660
Well, I can send Mouch down here

529
00:31:31,729 --> 00:31:32,814
tonight if you want, Chief.

530
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,252
You do that, and
I will take those bugles

531
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:37,199
from your collar my damn self.

532
00:31:48,078 --> 00:31:50,212
Hi, Zach, I'm the one who called.

533
00:31:50,281 --> 00:31:52,381
Yes, she is always calling men.

534
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:55,217
All the time. Anyway, I'm Stella Kidd,

535
00:31:55,286 --> 00:31:57,386
and it is just so great
to see you again.

536
00:31:57,455 --> 00:32:00,556
I'm... Sylvie.

537
00:32:00,624 --> 00:32:02,357
I literally never, ever call men.

538
00:32:02,426 --> 00:32:03,946
I don't know what she's talking about.

539
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,063
How can I help?

540
00:32:08,132 --> 00:32:10,599
It's yeah...

541
00:32:10,668 --> 00:32:14,203
Hey, welcome to 51!

542
00:32:14,271 --> 00:32:17,573
Yep, we got a mystery odor,
and for once,

543
00:32:17,641 --> 00:32:19,408
it's not coming from Otis.

544
00:32:19,477 --> 00:32:22,110
Yeah, I can smell it.

545
00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:25,113
All right, this is one
of my favorite toys.

546
00:32:25,197 --> 00:32:26,713
It works like a supernose.

547
00:32:26,823 --> 00:32:29,251
Fruit companies use them
to identify rotting fruit

548
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,921
in big batches... we use them to
identify dead bodies in rubble.

549
00:32:34,187 --> 00:32:37,724
You know, I got a
Japanese firefighting robot

550
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:41,539
that actually has over
200 temperature gauges.

551
00:32:50,374 --> 00:32:52,443
It's in here.

552
00:32:53,077 --> 00:32:55,110
- In there?
- Yeah.

553
00:32:55,179 --> 00:32:56,802
Your walls are thick concrete tile,

554
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:59,615
but these dividers are painted to match.

555
00:32:59,683 --> 00:33:00,949
Must be hollow.

556
00:33:01,018 --> 00:33:03,281
Someone get me a chisel and a mallet.

557
00:33:03,661 --> 00:33:05,874
You were quick.

558
00:33:06,423 --> 00:33:08,957
- So quick.
- I'm so grateful we called you.

559
00:33:09,026 --> 00:33:10,292
Great idea I had.

560
00:33:10,361 --> 00:33:12,928
It was my idea, actually.

561
00:33:15,533 --> 00:33:17,132
Thanks.

562
00:33:20,304 --> 00:33:21,503
Okay.

563
00:33:33,817 --> 00:33:36,652
Yeah, feel something.

564
00:33:38,889 --> 00:33:40,889
I think it's a dead critter.

565
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:43,525
I can just reach...

566
00:33:43,594 --> 00:33:46,028
where it is... yeah.

567
00:33:46,864 --> 00:33:48,363
Oof.

568
00:33:56,574 --> 00:33:58,574
Hey, guys.

569
00:33:58,642 --> 00:34:01,577
So, what's the verdict?

570
00:34:01,646 --> 00:34:03,513
We found the smell!

571
00:34:12,423 --> 00:34:14,591
I'll just dispose
of this on my way back.

572
00:34:14,735 --> 00:34:16,359
Thank you so much for your help.

573
00:34:16,532 --> 00:34:20,009
You may have to come back
and look for two more bodies

574
00:34:20,048 --> 00:34:21,254
stuffed into the walls!

575
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:24,247
Okay, look, Mr. Sprinkles got away.

576
00:34:24,302 --> 00:34:26,135
We didn't want to break
your kid's heart.

577
00:34:26,204 --> 00:34:29,205
I'm gonna break
something, all right.

578
00:34:36,481 --> 00:34:40,983
Truck 81! Bunkroom, now, please!

579
00:34:44,689 --> 00:34:46,122
Okay.

580
00:34:46,191 --> 00:34:49,509
- Well, thanks, Zach.
- Yeah.

581
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,253
Sure.

582
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:52,988
Okay.

583
00:34:56,127 --> 00:35:00,129
Um, so listen, my friend, Stella,

584
00:35:00,197 --> 00:35:02,644
the tall one who was just here...

585
00:35:02,691 --> 00:35:03,723
I remember.

586
00:35:03,753 --> 00:35:06,034
She's...

587
00:35:08,939 --> 00:35:11,173
She's fantastic.

588
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:14,076
I just thought you should know that.

589
00:35:19,216 --> 00:35:21,250
Do you have her number?

590
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,891
Yeah.

591
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:30,559
Listen up!

592
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,628
I want all the bunks back where they go.

593
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,079
I want that hole covered
until we get it repaired.

594
00:35:35,141 --> 00:35:37,480
I want the plumbing closet
in the hall cleaned up

595
00:35:37,574 --> 00:35:39,676
and looking the way it did
when we started shift.

596
00:35:39,746 --> 00:35:40,969
Are we clear?

597
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:43,277
Ayeaye, Captain!

598
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,808
Okay, here we go.

599
00:35:46,877 --> 00:35:49,144
There will be no humming while we work!

600
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:52,014
- Okay.
- None? Can we whistle?

601
00:35:52,082 --> 00:35:53,982
O, Captain! My, Captain!

602
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:55,519
We're fishing!

603
00:35:55,574 --> 00:35:57,319
- It's an improvement!
- You know what?

604
00:35:57,388 --> 00:35:58,956
Cindy's gonna wonder where I've been!

605
00:35:59,019 --> 00:36:01,542
You act like you smell so good!

606
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:14,214
I appreciate your zest!

607
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:17,999
- Okay, all right.
- We gotta move it! Let's go!

608
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:21,546
Hey! Captain!

609
00:36:21,866 --> 00:36:23,946
Yay!

610
00:36:24,014 --> 00:36:25,781
What's a stave?

611
00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:29,128
Guys, Lily was so nice to do this.

612
00:36:29,423 --> 00:36:32,221
A fitting tribute for our wall of fame.

613
00:36:35,859 --> 00:36:37,359
Isn't it great?

614
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:40,862
I'll put it right next to
Burgess' bulletproof vest!

615
00:36:40,931 --> 00:36:42,864
Harhar.

616
00:36:42,933 --> 00:36:45,867
That animal died because of you nitwits!

617
00:36:45,936 --> 00:36:48,670
Actually, he sacrificed itself

618
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:52,026
for the greater good. Because of my...

619
00:36:52,089 --> 00:36:55,544
Because of the anonymous
whistleblower call,

620
00:36:55,613 --> 00:37:01,049
headquarters has approved brand
new mattresses for the bunks!

621
00:37:03,053 --> 00:37:05,654
- We're getting Memory Foam?
- I know, right?

622
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:11,927
You know what? Let's go!

623
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:14,259
200 bucks, each of you.

624
00:37:14,324 --> 00:37:15,819
For what?

625
00:37:16,168 --> 00:37:18,202
The Chicago Humane Society,

626
00:37:18,227 --> 00:37:21,160
or you are never drinking
at Molly's again!

627
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,906
Come on!

628
00:37:24,975 --> 00:37:28,043
Cough it up! Dig!

629
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:30,712
- There you go. You too.
- What did I do?

630
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:33,148
It's a good cause!

631
00:37:36,987 --> 00:37:38,687
Guess what, Dorothy?

632
00:37:38,771 --> 00:37:42,975
I just got a call from Zach,
the handsome Hazmat guy.

633
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:46,671
And we are going on
a date tomorrow night!

634
00:37:46,757 --> 00:37:49,064
I'm happy for you. He seems terrific.

635
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,438
- Wait a second.
- What?

636
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:00,609
What did you say to him
when I had to go back inside?

637
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:02,544
- Nothing.
- Nothing, nothing.

638
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:04,379
What'd you say?

639
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:08,419
God, you felt sorry for me,

640
00:38:08,474 --> 00:38:10,130
and so you told him to ask me out.

641
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:13,027
No, no, he asked for your number.

642
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:16,825
I just... I told him you were fantastic.

643
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:19,194
Which you are, so...

644
00:38:26,312 --> 00:38:27,545
You're the best!

645
00:38:29,898 --> 00:38:31,865
Talked to Antonio,
told him about the aunt.

646
00:38:32,007 --> 00:38:33,462
He ran a quick vet on her,

647
00:38:33,503 --> 00:38:35,073
and she's got a history
of mental illness.

648
00:38:35,097 --> 00:38:36,678
Yeah?

649
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:39,147
He also read me the police
report on the mom.

650
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:41,149
She did kill herself.

651
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:43,819
Bria was only six.

652
00:38:43,887 --> 00:38:46,788
Did he say how?

653
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:48,323
Selfinflicted gunshot.

654
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,516
Father and daughter
weren't home at the time.

655
00:38:50,586 --> 00:38:52,661
The neighbors saw the mom
go in, heard the shot,

656
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,330
called the police.

657
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,065
Anyway...

658
00:38:58,268 --> 00:39:01,269
It's gotta be brutal
for the both of them.

659
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:10,062
Hello?

660
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:12,544
Yeah, this is she.

661
00:39:19,029 --> 00:39:21,013
Can you describe her?

662
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:27,696
Okay, yeah, I'll be right there.

663
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:33,436
What is it?

664
00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:36,092
That was the morgue, um...

665
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,340
A Jane Doe teenage girl just rolled in.

666
00:39:38,365 --> 00:39:40,465
She had my card in her purse.

667
00:39:43,932 --> 00:39:46,086
Hey, I'll take her.

668
00:39:52,492 --> 00:39:57,492

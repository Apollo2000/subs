1
00:00:00,893 --> 00:00:02,053
Maria Jamison?

2
00:00:02,053 --> 00:00:04,053
Her dad got himself in a mess
with painkillers.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,039
She's a good kid.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,883
The deputy commissioner asked me

5
00:00:07,884 --> 00:00:10,843
for my ideas about a replacement

6
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,677
once I ride off into the sunset.

7
00:00:12,678 --> 00:00:14,678
Then I told him, Wallace Boden.

8
00:00:15,055 --> 00:00:16,214
Deputy district chief.

9
00:00:16,215 --> 00:00:17,935
Damn, that's a big promotion.

10
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:19,550
If I don't get my clearance this week,

11
00:00:19,575 --> 00:00:20,800
I plan to step aside.

12
00:00:20,825 --> 00:00:22,699
Go to your assessment, get your results,

13
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,331
take it from there.

14
00:00:24,356 --> 00:00:27,759
- Mr. Zvonecek, ready?
- Yeah.

15
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:28,887
I'm ready.

16
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,815
If it's bad news,
don't stall, Dr. Mayberry.

17
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:51,983
Just tell it to me like it is.

18
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,885
It's not.

19
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:57,622
You are clear to return to active duty.

20
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:04,829
<i>Yeah!</i>

21
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,073
Okay, so before we begin
this morning's briefing

22
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:17,675
and before we officially
welcome Otis back

23
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,344
to his spot on Truck 81...

24
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:24,248
- Otis.
- Whoo... whoo!

25
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:25,917
I understand that Captain Casey

26
00:01:25,942 --> 00:01:27,141
would like to say a few words.

27
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:29,000
Yes, I would.

28
00:01:29,025 --> 00:01:30,658
I would, actually.

29
00:01:30,683 --> 00:01:32,416
A lot of thought and consideration

30
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,625
go into honoring those in our firehouse

31
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:38,496
who struggle to overcome impossible odds.

32
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:43,378
To earn a place of respect
on any wall here at 51, well...

33
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:47,508
That is only reserved
for the strongest among us...

34
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:51,220
which is why we would like to recognize

35
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:54,979
Otis' cane.

36
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:57,404
She bent, but she never broke.

37
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,895
She fell, but she never stayed down.

38
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,954
She had to endure palm sweat
that no object

39
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:06,290
on this planet should be subjected to.

40
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,495
To Otis' cane.

41
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:14,399
- Welcome back, buddy.
- Thanks.

42
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,168
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

43
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,206
Chief Grissom.

44
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,466
Wallace.

45
00:02:21,535 --> 00:02:23,307
Nice surprise.

46
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,543
You might change your mind when you hear

47
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,211
what I have to say.

48
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,700
I came here a while ago,
got your hopes up about

49
00:02:30,725 --> 00:02:32,339
a promotion.

50
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:35,138
Chance to fill my shoes
once I step aside.

51
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,807
But...

52
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:41,228
But I've decided not to step aside.

53
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:45,027
I see.

54
00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:46,629
You remember that scaffolding incident

55
00:02:46,698 --> 00:02:49,565
Severide and I went up and
pulled that kid to safety?

56
00:02:49,634 --> 00:02:52,134
Yeah, good save.

57
00:02:54,072 --> 00:02:55,905
That was the first time in a while

58
00:02:55,974 --> 00:02:57,907
that I got my hands dirty.

59
00:02:57,976 --> 00:03:00,142
Nice reminder of...

60
00:03:00,211 --> 00:03:02,958
Why I got into this life
in the first place.

61
00:03:03,481 --> 00:03:06,749
I got blinded there
for a bit by all the paperwork

62
00:03:06,818 --> 00:03:08,885
and policy meetings, but I realize now

63
00:03:08,953 --> 00:03:10,987
that I've still got more to give.

64
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:13,927
And I want to give it.

65
00:03:15,426 --> 00:03:19,182
So, I'm putting my retirement on hold.

66
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,811
Hmm.

67
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,203
Anyway...

68
00:03:27,272 --> 00:03:29,318
I just wanted you to hear that from me.

69
00:03:32,477 --> 00:03:35,378
<i>Squad 3, pin-in accident.
24 North Green Street.</i>

70
00:03:35,446 --> 00:03:38,414
I better go get my hands dirty myself.

71
00:03:38,702 --> 00:03:40,329
Do your thing.

72
00:03:41,452 --> 00:03:42,831
Yeah.

73
00:04:06,897 --> 00:04:08,544
Looks like a single vehicle accident,

74
00:04:08,613 --> 00:04:10,146
best I can tell.

75
00:04:14,052 --> 00:04:16,919
Hey! Hey, sir!

76
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:18,788
You okay?

77
00:04:18,856 --> 00:04:20,823
- Capp, grab a ladder.
- Copy.

78
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:22,959
I saw the whole thing from up there.

79
00:04:23,027 --> 00:04:24,260
He hit someone.

80
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:26,228
- What?
- He was going too fast,

81
00:04:26,297 --> 00:04:28,497
swerved into some woman
walking in the street,

82
00:04:28,566 --> 00:04:30,128
but he hit her.

83
00:04:34,846 --> 00:04:39,783

00:04:44,082 --> 00:04:47,483
Come on. Come on, there.

85
00:04:47,552 --> 00:04:49,652
Hey, Tony, give me a hand here.

86
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:51,354
Yeah.

87
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:54,490
Come on...

88
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:56,926
Hey, hey, buddy.

89
00:04:56,995 --> 00:04:58,627
- How you doing?
- I didn't see her.

90
00:04:58,696 --> 00:05:00,863
It's okay, it's all right.
Just don't move your neck.

91
00:05:00,932 --> 00:05:02,331
Capp, I need a c-collar.

92
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,434
- Copy that!
- Come on...

93
00:05:05,503 --> 00:05:08,337
Come on. Come on.

94
00:05:08,406 --> 00:05:11,140
Ready?

95
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:12,775
One, two.

96
00:05:12,844 --> 00:05:15,511
Okay!

97
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,547
She's not breathing.
I think her leg's snapped.

98
00:05:18,616 --> 00:05:21,050
Let's get her to the sidewalk.

99
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:23,786
Tony! Grab any water
you can from the rig.

100
00:05:23,855 --> 00:05:25,058
Got it!

101
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,227
Okay.

102
00:05:27,792 --> 00:05:32,107
All right, coming in, buddy.

103
00:05:33,031 --> 00:05:35,355
- Come on. Come on now.
- Watch your arm.

104
00:05:35,424 --> 00:05:36,665
Tony!

105
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:38,334
Breathe for me.

106
00:05:38,403 --> 00:05:39,468
Come on now.

107
00:05:39,537 --> 00:05:40,671
Come on.

108
00:05:41,305 --> 00:05:43,702
It's in her mouth. Can't get it in there.

109
00:05:44,642 --> 00:05:46,538
Come on, get in there...

110
00:05:50,915 --> 00:05:52,748
Come on!

111
00:05:52,817 --> 00:05:54,671
Come on, breathe for me.

112
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:58,216
Breathe.

113
00:06:00,024 --> 00:06:01,891
Where's ambo?

114
00:06:06,397 --> 00:06:09,698
Stoltz!

115
00:06:11,736 --> 00:06:13,482
Breathe for me, come on.

116
00:06:14,572 --> 00:06:16,372
What do we got?

117
00:06:16,397 --> 00:06:18,230
She got a face full of concrete.

118
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:19,822
I think she's got a broken leg, too.

119
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:20,942
Get in here!

120
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:32,209
Come on...

121
00:06:36,461 --> 00:06:38,394
There we go, there we go.

122
00:06:38,463 --> 00:06:41,397
Okay, okay, we got you.

123
00:06:53,311 --> 00:06:55,065
What got into you?

124
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,280
Had a wake-up call this morning.

125
00:07:08,493 --> 00:07:10,292
Hey, Otis, talked to Herrmann

126
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:11,660
and we're going to handle the cooking

127
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:13,896
till you get your legs back under you.

128
00:07:13,965 --> 00:07:16,132
I didn't...

129
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,754
- I-I-I didn't...
- It's cool.

130
00:07:18,903 --> 00:07:20,136
All right, look,

131
00:07:20,204 --> 00:07:22,338
I got to say one thing, all right?

132
00:07:22,406 --> 00:07:24,807
The food bill has definitely gone down

133
00:07:24,876 --> 00:07:28,077
since we got rid of that Cordova giant.

134
00:07:28,146 --> 00:07:29,512
We didn't get rid of anyone.

135
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,247
We just kept Otis' seat warm.

136
00:07:31,315 --> 00:07:33,019
Appreciate that, captain.

137
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,020
So, I would like to be

138
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:41,945
up front and above board with everyone.

139
00:07:42,827 --> 00:07:45,198
I want to keep driving the truck.

140
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:53,035
Okay, I'll bite.

141
00:07:53,104 --> 00:07:55,104
What's the punch line?

142
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:57,439
It's not a joke.

143
00:07:57,508 --> 00:07:59,275
Look, the great thing about 51

144
00:07:59,343 --> 00:08:00,809
is we don't baby anybody around here.

145
00:08:00,878 --> 00:08:03,612
You're cleared for duty
and that is great,

146
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:05,648
but I stepped up when you were gone.

147
00:08:05,716 --> 00:08:09,139
I like driving
and so I want to keep doing it.

148
00:08:09,854 --> 00:08:11,808
Okay, listen...

149
00:08:13,057 --> 00:08:14,356
Stella makes a valid point.

150
00:08:14,425 --> 00:08:16,479
- Captain!
- She does.

151
00:08:17,461 --> 00:08:19,328
Way I see it...

152
00:08:19,397 --> 00:08:21,130
When I played high school football,

153
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,132
we had two very good quarterbacks,

154
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:25,334
Scott Schultz and Todd Phillips.

155
00:08:25,403 --> 00:08:26,969
Coach used all his spring training

156
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:28,971
to figure out who he wanted as a starter,

157
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,494
Scott or Todd.

158
00:08:32,443 --> 00:08:34,143
We should set up some spring training

159
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:36,465
to see who's best behind the wheel of 81.

160
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,168
Works for me.

161
00:08:40,017 --> 00:08:43,173
Yeah. Great.

162
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,157
Hey. I just got this message

163
00:08:48,226 --> 00:08:50,826
from Bria and she sounds really upset.

164
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:52,528
- So call her.
- Well, she's not picking up.

165
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:55,164
Okay, let's not jump
to the worst conclusion.

166
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:56,398
Well, you know how my brain works.

167
00:08:56,467 --> 00:08:58,067
I do, which is why mean to tell you

168
00:08:58,135 --> 00:09:00,002
to take a deep breath
and wait until you actually

169
00:09:00,071 --> 00:09:01,370
make contact with her.

170
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,526
Just everything she's been through...

171
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:06,575
Let's not forget she's a teenage girl.

172
00:09:06,644 --> 00:09:08,031
Exactly.

173
00:09:10,848 --> 00:09:12,285
Come on.

174
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:17,853
- Whoa.
- What's up?

175
00:09:17,922 --> 00:09:20,756
I just got a Facebook message
from Delia Cantor.

176
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:22,545
And?

177
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:24,627
When they write my life story,

178
00:09:24,695 --> 00:09:27,029
she is the chapter titled
"the one who got away."

179
00:09:27,098 --> 00:09:28,397
I don't like biographies.

180
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:30,099
We went out all of junior year,

181
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:31,634
all of senior year.

182
00:09:31,702 --> 00:09:33,535
I thought we were going
to get married someday.

183
00:09:33,604 --> 00:09:36,138
She got a track scholarship
to Kansas; it just kind of...

184
00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:38,540
Trailed off after that.

185
00:09:38,609 --> 00:09:41,410
She went places and I stayed here.

186
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:43,525
How's she looking?

187
00:09:47,051 --> 00:09:48,571
Hey.

188
00:09:50,154 --> 00:09:51,387
She's married.

189
00:09:51,455 --> 00:09:54,056
Yeah. But it's still pretty cool

190
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,424
that she reached out.

191
00:09:55,493 --> 00:09:57,459
I'd love to see her. Catch up.

192
00:09:57,528 --> 00:10:00,429
Ask her what she's been doing
the last 20 years.

193
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,271
Chief. There was a box in there

194
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,007
of some old photos.
Think they may be yours?

195
00:10:12,076 --> 00:10:13,509
Thank you, Connie.

196
00:10:13,577 --> 00:10:15,277
It's a mess in there.

197
00:10:15,346 --> 00:10:17,546
I appreciate you cleaning it up.

198
00:11:05,196 --> 00:11:07,296
Hey, Bria, it's Gabby.

199
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:09,569
Can you call me back when you get this?

200
00:11:12,803 --> 00:11:14,470
You want to run by her apartment?

201
00:11:14,538 --> 00:11:16,805
- Should we?
- Absolutely.

202
00:11:16,874 --> 00:11:19,579
Okay, yeah, I'll... I'll tell Matt.

203
00:11:19,604 --> 00:11:21,080
Hello?

204
00:11:21,979 --> 00:11:23,708
Mr. Jamison.

205
00:11:24,415 --> 00:11:25,981
Gabby.

206
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,983
Bria just called me. She left a message.

207
00:11:28,052 --> 00:11:29,651
Yeah, um, about that...

208
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,155
I need your help.
She... she needs your help.

209
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,512
I have no idea what to do.

210
00:11:43,613 --> 00:11:45,648
I heard Bria's dad is here.

211
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,149
Well, it turns out Bria does need my help

212
00:11:47,151 --> 00:11:49,359
after all, just not the help
we were worried about.

213
00:11:49,737 --> 00:11:50,886
Meaning what?

214
00:11:50,888 --> 00:11:52,987
Meaning girl stuff.

215
00:11:54,993 --> 00:11:56,659
She called the right person,
I'll tell you that.

216
00:11:56,728 --> 00:11:59,362
Why do I get the feeling
you just found a new mission?

217
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,870
'Cause I did.

218
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,200
Just wondering if anyone's inspected

219
00:12:04,268 --> 00:12:07,069
the inside rear tire
since I've been gone.

220
00:12:07,138 --> 00:12:09,171
Pretty standard. Something every driver

221
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,074
should know how to do
in case, I don't know,

222
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:14,643
a rock gets wedged in there or something.

223
00:12:14,712 --> 00:12:16,078
Pretty dangerous.

224
00:12:16,147 --> 00:12:19,015
You know, it's funny, when I stepped into

225
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,416
driving duties at a moment's notice

226
00:12:20,485 --> 00:12:22,651
and was well prepared and totally ready,

227
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,687
I noticed that many of the lug nuts

228
00:12:24,756 --> 00:12:27,189
on the left side of 81 were loose.

229
00:12:27,258 --> 00:12:29,692
And while that is certainly
careless of the previous driver

230
00:12:29,717 --> 00:12:30,809
I didn't judge.

231
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,565
I just went around
and tightened everything up.

232
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:36,232
What are you two doing?

233
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,933
Just pointing out that service has been

234
00:12:38,002 --> 00:12:39,835
slipping a bit since I've been absent.

235
00:12:39,904 --> 00:12:42,238
And I am pointing out that improvement

236
00:12:42,263 --> 00:12:45,298
is measurable in nearly every respect.

237
00:12:45,323 --> 00:12:47,022
This is stupid.

238
00:12:47,178 --> 00:12:49,578
Casey won't say it,
I'll say it, all right?

239
00:12:49,647 --> 00:12:51,080
Otis is driving, end of story.

240
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:52,681
Boom, drop the mic.

241
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,583
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Pick that mic back up,

242
00:12:54,652 --> 00:12:56,919
plug it back into the jack,
because that is far

243
00:12:56,988 --> 00:12:58,187
from the end of this story.

244
00:12:58,256 --> 00:13:01,023
Stella, I love you like a daughter,

245
00:13:01,092 --> 00:13:02,958
but if you want to drive...

246
00:13:03,027 --> 00:13:04,360
Find another house.

247
00:13:04,385 --> 00:13:07,052
Or, Herrmann... stay with me on this...

248
00:13:07,165 --> 00:13:10,533
- you can kiss my pretty little...
- Hold on... hold on!

249
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:13,702
Before anyone says anything regrettable.

250
00:13:13,771 --> 00:13:16,008
Casey told us we're going
to have a competition for it.

251
00:13:16,653 --> 00:13:18,586
Let's have a competition.

252
00:13:18,843 --> 00:13:22,912
Defeated a bullet.
I can take on any comers.

253
00:13:25,455 --> 00:13:27,957
I mean, it's not like
it's a mud-100 or anything.

254
00:13:31,823 --> 00:13:34,790
Hey, I talked to Charlie
over at Lion's Total Care.

255
00:13:34,859 --> 00:13:36,892
He's coming Tuesday
to pick up my turnout gear

256
00:13:36,961 --> 00:13:38,294
if you want in on that.

257
00:13:38,362 --> 00:13:40,995
Yeah, I'll, uh, throw mine in the cage.

258
00:13:41,064 --> 00:13:42,305
All right.

259
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:46,735
Can I help you, sir?

260
00:13:46,804 --> 00:13:48,471
I...

261
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:51,674
I understand this station
saved my daughter this morning.

262
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:55,578
The cement truck... How is she?

263
00:13:55,646 --> 00:13:59,515
Doing good, doing good.
She has a leg fracture, but...

264
00:13:59,584 --> 00:14:01,984
I understand had you guys
shown up even a minute later

265
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,701
it would have been...

266
00:14:04,489 --> 00:14:05,921
More than that.

267
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:09,125
Yeah, no, we're... Glad she's okay.

268
00:14:09,193 --> 00:14:11,709
It's always good to know
when we make a difference.

269
00:14:12,597 --> 00:14:14,163
My mother told me

270
00:14:14,232 --> 00:14:16,165
when a stranger does a kindness for you,

271
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,366
you look them in the eye
and say thank you.

272
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:21,636
So... So thank you.

273
00:14:24,305 --> 00:14:25,875
Sure.

274
00:14:25,943 --> 00:14:27,710
I'm glad to do it.

275
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:29,268
Will you...

276
00:14:30,047 --> 00:14:32,131
Give our best to your daughter for us?

277
00:14:32,156 --> 00:14:33,756
Will do, um...

278
00:14:34,252 --> 00:14:35,384
Wallace.

279
00:14:35,453 --> 00:14:39,529
Will do, Wallace. Thank you again.

280
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:01,163
Boom shak-a-laka, she replied!

281
00:15:01,188 --> 00:15:02,510
What'd she say?

282
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,481
She wants to get together tomorrow.

283
00:15:04,506 --> 00:15:06,848
- Dinner downtown.
- What'd you say?

284
00:15:07,385 --> 00:15:09,552
What'd you think I said?
I look forward to it.

285
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:13,055
Bad idea. Can't relive your past.

286
00:15:13,124 --> 00:15:15,991
Thanks to Facebook, you can.

287
00:15:20,064 --> 00:15:23,956
<i>Ambulance 61, personal injury.</i>

288
00:15:37,381 --> 00:15:39,242
I had him up in the chair

289
00:15:39,311 --> 00:15:40,683
and my foot hit the lever

290
00:15:40,751 --> 00:15:41,955
- and...
- Then what?

291
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,510
The chair slipped! Come on!

292
00:15:46,724 --> 00:15:50,683
No! Agh!

293
00:15:51,261 --> 00:15:52,894
Oh!

294
00:15:54,131 --> 00:15:56,932
And he cut off my damn ear!

295
00:15:57,001 --> 00:15:58,534
Let me see.

296
00:15:58,603 --> 00:16:00,985
Ah, Ah!

297
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,116
- You Andy?
- Yes, ma'am.

298
00:16:14,185 --> 00:16:15,551
You guys got any ice here?

299
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,319
- In the back.
- Okay, grab a plastic bag,

300
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:18,877
fill it up with ice, and bring it to me.

301
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,122
Okay.

302
00:16:20,191 --> 00:16:21,991
You telling me you can take

303
00:16:22,016 --> 00:16:24,217
that man's ear
and fix it back on his head.

304
00:16:24,242 --> 00:16:26,886
We are going to give
it a fighting chance.

305
00:16:56,994 --> 00:16:59,400
- Okay.
- All right, can you walk?

306
00:16:59,468 --> 00:17:00,919
- What?
- Can you walk?

307
00:17:00,988 --> 00:17:02,598
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I can walk.

308
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:05,401
He hasn't cut my legs off,
at least not yet!

309
00:17:13,511 --> 00:17:15,226
Yep.

310
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,147
Who's next?

311
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:23,859
Kelly, got a favor to ask.

312
00:17:24,355 --> 00:17:25,988
What you got going on this morning?

313
00:17:26,057 --> 00:17:27,656
- No plans.
- Do you mind running

314
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:29,014
an errand with me?

315
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,373
- Need your expertise.
- Whatever you need.

316
00:17:31,529 --> 00:17:33,696
I was talking to Scott
from four doors down.

317
00:17:33,764 --> 00:17:36,298
You know him?
Australian guy, Korean wife.

318
00:17:36,367 --> 00:17:37,966
Oh yeah, I like them.

319
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:39,991
He said to me, "You wanna come over

320
00:17:40,104 --> 00:17:42,004
"on Saturday and watch the rugby?

321
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:44,095
We're playing the All Blacks."

322
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,808
I said sounded good
but I'd check with you.

323
00:17:45,876 --> 00:17:47,142
Is that your Australian accent?

324
00:17:47,211 --> 00:17:49,144
Yeah, not bad right?

325
00:17:49,213 --> 00:17:50,813
Don't do it again.

326
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:52,147
Anyway, might be fun.

327
00:17:52,216 --> 00:17:53,515
I think it's going to be a block party.

328
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:55,184
No, baby, we can't.
We've got that Bria thing.

329
00:17:55,252 --> 00:17:56,185
Remember I told you?

330
00:17:56,253 --> 00:17:58,269
Oh, that Saturday?

331
00:17:59,061 --> 00:18:02,034
Right, Saturday. I absolutely

332
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:03,359
was paying attention when you said that.

333
00:18:03,384 --> 00:18:05,117
Actually can we swing by
Bria's apartment now?

334
00:18:05,142 --> 00:18:06,975
I think she's spinning out.
I got to calm her down.

335
00:18:07,445 --> 00:18:09,298
- Yeah, sure.
- Good.

336
00:18:15,873 --> 00:18:17,271
- Hey?
- Where is she?

337
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,831
In her room.

338
00:18:26,617 --> 00:18:29,017
I look like that girl from
the Adam's family.

339
00:18:29,086 --> 00:18:30,252
No, you don't.

340
00:18:30,321 --> 00:18:31,253
You look beautiful under there.

341
00:18:31,322 --> 00:18:33,012
Prom's in four days.

342
00:18:33,624 --> 00:18:35,514
I know. Your Dad told me.

343
00:18:36,427 --> 00:18:39,977
Hey, it's going to be fine.

344
00:18:40,557 --> 00:18:42,023
I live for this stuff.

345
00:18:42,366 --> 00:18:44,899
Really? 'Cause I look gross.

346
00:18:46,137 --> 00:18:48,027
Have I ever steered you wrong?

347
00:18:53,043 --> 00:18:54,575
Come on.

348
00:18:58,182 --> 00:19:01,450
First, we're going to wipe that off

349
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:03,051
and look at the Bria underneath.

350
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,454
Because that Bria is going to turn heads

351
00:19:05,523 --> 00:19:08,506
when she enters the dance.
I promise you that.

352
00:19:18,569 --> 00:19:21,685
All my friends at school,
they have moms to help.

353
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,700
With me, it's just Dad.

354
00:19:24,725 --> 00:19:26,941
He's even worse at this stuff than I...

355
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,948
Well, now you have me.

356
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,402
You know I thought about all the ways

357
00:19:47,404 --> 00:19:48,577
that I could provide for

358
00:19:48,579 --> 00:19:50,674
my daughter while I was in the clinic.

359
00:19:50,674 --> 00:19:53,141
I never thought about how to get ready

360
00:19:53,143 --> 00:19:54,910
for the prom.

361
00:19:54,912 --> 00:19:57,246
Well, you called a superwoman.

362
00:19:57,248 --> 00:19:59,114
So when I tell you she's got this,

363
00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:00,599
she's got this.

364
00:20:02,486 --> 00:20:04,835
So, how's the rest of it going?

365
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,227
Since, you know...

366
00:20:07,645 --> 00:20:10,579
Since I cleaned up? It's better.

367
00:20:10,604 --> 00:20:13,805
It's much, much better.
I got my job back.

368
00:20:14,098 --> 00:20:18,333
Turns out this guy, Sam,
that I'm on the line with,

369
00:20:18,358 --> 00:20:20,758
he got moved up to supervisor and he said

370
00:20:20,783 --> 00:20:23,664
the past is the past
and he put me right to work.

371
00:20:24,842 --> 00:20:27,376
Now I'm just saving up to get
out of this dump.

372
00:20:28,746 --> 00:20:30,979
That's really good news.

373
00:20:31,048 --> 00:20:32,648
Yeah.

374
00:20:33,891 --> 00:20:36,969
So, who's the lucky guy?

375
00:20:38,228 --> 00:20:40,347
His name is Donovan Mitchell.

376
00:20:41,064 --> 00:20:42,764
He's awesome.

377
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,811
Well, if he asked you, I know he is.

378
00:20:47,504 --> 00:20:50,505
He's like me. We don't have a lot.

379
00:20:50,574 --> 00:20:53,775
I mean, we're not taking a limo
or doing a fancy dinner

380
00:20:53,844 --> 00:20:55,443
or anything.

381
00:20:55,512 --> 00:20:57,740
I just want to look nice
when we get there.

382
00:20:59,783 --> 00:21:02,384
You're going to look like a knock-out.

383
00:21:04,354 --> 00:21:05,687
Okay, let's try out some looks.

384
00:21:05,756 --> 00:21:07,589
- You can tell me what's best.
- Okay.

385
00:21:07,614 --> 00:21:12,150
Uh-huh, yeah, I know, they're both here.

386
00:21:12,262 --> 00:21:13,881
Yeah...

387
00:21:14,331 --> 00:21:16,717
Okay, will do.

388
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:22,103
So, hey, that was Casey and he says

389
00:21:22,128 --> 00:21:24,391
that spring training starts now.

390
00:21:25,275 --> 00:21:26,541
- Explain.
- Mm-hmm.

391
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,243
Well, he says since Mouch and I

392
00:21:28,312 --> 00:21:30,779
are the main ones to benefit, or suffer,

393
00:21:30,848 --> 00:21:34,316
depending on which way this
driver choice thing pans out,

394
00:21:34,384 --> 00:21:36,218
that we should, you know, have a big part

395
00:21:36,286 --> 00:21:37,452
in the evaluation.

396
00:21:37,521 --> 00:21:39,387
That's leadership right there.

397
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,324
- That sounds like BS. Mm-hmm.
- Oh, yeah?

398
00:21:42,392 --> 00:21:45,060
Do you want to call him?
Call him. Be my guest.

399
00:21:45,128 --> 00:21:47,629
Tell us the competition
you have in mind, Herrmann.

400
00:21:47,698 --> 00:21:49,898
There's two cabinets there
full of glasses

401
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:51,333
that need polishing.

402
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:54,588
There's two more down there.
First one done...

403
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,404
Wins my endorsement.

404
00:21:56,473 --> 00:21:59,051
Now I know you're full of it.

405
00:21:59,977 --> 00:22:01,428
Am I?

406
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,803
What...

407
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,060
Well, you didn't say go!

408
00:22:10,754 --> 00:22:12,988
Did you really talk to Casey?

409
00:22:21,198 --> 00:22:23,265
What brought this on?

410
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,634
Been thinking about it a long time.

411
00:22:25,702 --> 00:22:27,769
Figured I'd reward myself if I ever made

412
00:22:27,794 --> 00:22:30,228
deputy district chief, but...

413
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,438
- That's not happening.
- No?

414
00:22:32,463 --> 00:22:33,896
No.

415
00:22:34,211 --> 00:22:36,145
Found out yesterday morning.

416
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,937
Well, don't overreact.

417
00:22:38,181 --> 00:22:40,148
I'm not.

418
00:22:40,217 --> 00:22:41,650
Just got to thinking.

419
00:22:41,718 --> 00:22:45,787
I spent a lot of time
waiting for good things

420
00:22:45,812 --> 00:22:49,226
and not enough time pursuing 'em.

421
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,460
Mom and Daddy brought me up
humble and proud.

422
00:22:52,529 --> 00:22:55,964
So... awards, commendations, promotions,

423
00:22:56,033 --> 00:22:57,966
they weren't things that you seek out.

424
00:22:58,035 --> 00:23:00,235
I mean if they came along
that's fine, but...

425
00:23:00,304 --> 00:23:02,239
they weren't pursued.

426
00:23:04,074 --> 00:23:05,640
It turns out...

427
00:23:05,709 --> 00:23:08,243
I kind of wanted that promotion.

428
00:23:08,312 --> 00:23:09,963
Yeah.

429
00:23:10,032 --> 00:23:12,547
Anyway, the reason we are here

430
00:23:12,616 --> 00:23:14,816
is I am not going
another summer without a boat.

431
00:23:14,885 --> 00:23:16,518
Somewhere where I can

432
00:23:16,586 --> 00:23:18,987
tool around the lake, go
fishing with you and Casey,

433
00:23:19,056 --> 00:23:22,324
or... Teach Terrance how to catch

434
00:23:22,392 --> 00:23:23,692
a large mouthed bass.

435
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,893
Okay, chief, but as a guy

436
00:23:24,962 --> 00:23:27,103
that repairs these, let me warn you.

437
00:23:27,128 --> 00:23:28,987
Two things I managed to never buy...

438
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:31,833
a horse or a boat.

439
00:23:48,535 --> 00:23:51,252
Josef Ignacio Cruz.

440
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:02,530
Look at you. Looking as fine as 1999.

441
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:05,200
You have not changed...

442
00:24:05,268 --> 00:24:07,736
A bit, Delia.

443
00:24:07,804 --> 00:24:10,438
Except I'm 36 and no longer
sprinting 100 meters,

444
00:24:10,507 --> 00:24:12,140
but, you know.

445
00:24:12,209 --> 00:24:13,936
I bet you still could.

446
00:24:20,717 --> 00:24:23,752
Oh, it's so good to see you.

447
00:24:24,955 --> 00:24:26,615
Yeah, you too.

448
00:24:27,991 --> 00:24:30,492
I couldn't believe it when
you showed up in my inbox.

449
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,496
I'm just glad you answered.

450
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,932
So...

451
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:42,070
I noticed on your relationship
status on Facebook

452
00:24:42,139 --> 00:24:44,672
- that you're...
- I say this right off the bat

453
00:24:44,741 --> 00:24:46,885
so you know I'm not playing with you, Jo.

454
00:24:47,644 --> 00:24:49,263
I am married.

455
00:24:50,747 --> 00:24:53,982
Yeah. That's... that's what I noticed.

456
00:24:54,865 --> 00:24:57,099
But... the truth is...

457
00:24:57,487 --> 00:25:00,088
I've thought about you.

458
00:25:00,157 --> 00:25:04,459
And that time we spent together
before I left to KU...

459
00:25:04,484 --> 00:25:07,823
Over and over again.

460
00:25:08,698 --> 00:25:10,784
I can't get it out of my head.

461
00:25:11,668 --> 00:25:13,036
I get it.

462
00:25:14,004 --> 00:25:15,470
But I don't want to just think

463
00:25:15,495 --> 00:25:17,261
about our time together anymore,

464
00:25:17,286 --> 00:25:18,585
you know?

465
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,669
Life's too short.

466
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:32,020
Yeah, I know what you mean.

467
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,823
Hey, Hermann.

468
00:25:34,891 --> 00:25:36,691
You used to run
that limo business, right?

469
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,460
Do you still have any connections?

470
00:25:38,528 --> 00:25:40,628
In the limo world? No, I got out

471
00:25:40,653 --> 00:25:42,853
while the getting was bad. Why?

472
00:25:42,966 --> 00:25:44,999
Oh, Bria and her boyfriend
are trying to go to prom

473
00:25:45,068 --> 00:25:47,302
I was seeing if I could
get them a discounted ride.

474
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,803
I walked to my prom.

475
00:25:48,872 --> 00:25:51,033
Told Sharlene to meet me there.

476
00:25:51,942 --> 00:25:54,642
Come to think of it,
that didn't go over so well.

477
00:25:54,711 --> 00:25:57,178
Hey, listen, you tell Bria

478
00:25:57,247 --> 00:25:59,013
that every single limo in the world

479
00:25:59,082 --> 00:26:01,149
has been puked in multiple times.

480
00:26:01,218 --> 00:26:03,651
And they even have a guy
at the limo company

481
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,720
whose job it is is to clean up the puke

482
00:26:05,789 --> 00:26:07,257
every weekend.

483
00:26:08,091 --> 00:26:10,058
You know what, you both have been

484
00:26:10,127 --> 00:26:11,261
a tremendous help.

485
00:26:11,962 --> 00:26:14,796
I'm just going to... Oh, Jesus.

486
00:26:20,337 --> 00:26:21,669
What's this?

487
00:26:21,738 --> 00:26:23,271
Outside messenger service dropped it off.

488
00:26:23,296 --> 00:26:24,877
That's all it had on it.

489
00:26:24,902 --> 00:26:26,485
Thanks, Connie.

490
00:26:36,953 --> 00:26:38,520
Connie!

491
00:26:38,588 --> 00:26:41,500
Get me the CFD legal department ASAP.

492
00:26:43,527 --> 00:26:45,693
Chief.

493
00:26:45,762 --> 00:26:47,262
What the hell is this?

494
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,696
I don't know.

495
00:26:48,765 --> 00:26:49,864
But we are going to do everything

496
00:26:49,933 --> 00:26:51,533
exactly by the book. Connie!

497
00:26:51,601 --> 00:26:53,868
You are witness for both of us
that we refuse this money

498
00:26:53,937 --> 00:26:55,537
and we are calling it in to headquarters.

499
00:26:55,605 --> 00:26:57,705
Yes, chief!

500
00:26:57,774 --> 00:27:00,708
- Who'd want to bribe us?
- And for what?

501
00:27:00,777 --> 00:27:02,710
There's no letter, there's no signature.

502
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:04,546
I have no idea what is going on here

503
00:27:04,614 --> 00:27:06,114
but I am not taking any chances.

504
00:27:06,183 --> 00:27:09,152
Attorney for the CFD on line one, chief.

505
00:27:10,654 --> 00:27:13,323
Chief Wallace Boden, Firehouse 51.

506
00:27:14,191 --> 00:27:16,224
Yes, thank you.

507
00:27:16,293 --> 00:27:18,120
I have something...

508
00:27:18,895 --> 00:27:21,863
That I want to make sure
I handle appropriately.

509
00:27:29,756 --> 00:27:32,257
If we don't hear again
from the CFD lawyer,

510
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:33,625
I'm going straight
from here to headquarters.

511
00:27:33,627 --> 00:27:35,394
I'm dropping this box off at her desk

512
00:27:35,396 --> 00:27:37,229
at the end of shift
and then she can deal with it.

513
00:27:37,231 --> 00:27:39,298
That's good by me.

514
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,633
- Chief.
- Is that her?

515
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:44,736
It's actually the commissioner's office.

516
00:27:49,484 --> 00:27:51,570
Chief Wallace Boden.

517
00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:54,448
Yes, ma'am, I understand.

518
00:27:55,482 --> 00:27:57,743
Yeah, I'm looking at him right now.

519
00:28:01,121 --> 00:28:03,588
We'll be right over.

520
00:28:03,657 --> 00:28:05,459
We've been summoned.

521
00:28:20,941 --> 00:28:23,542
She decelerated a bit there.

522
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:27,779
Uneven torque on the reverse turn.

523
00:28:27,848 --> 00:28:29,948
It affects overall fuel efficiency.

524
00:28:30,017 --> 00:28:31,485
It does.

525
00:28:41,528 --> 00:28:43,662
Well, pretty hard to improve

526
00:28:43,687 --> 00:28:46,321
on perfection, but good luck.

527
00:28:47,368 --> 00:28:49,501
I want a turn out on the blue island

528
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:52,671
up to the South Apron
and back through the cones.

529
00:28:55,676 --> 00:29:00,145
Hey, don't even think about
that turtle enclosure

530
00:29:00,214 --> 00:29:02,814
that you backed right into and crushed.

531
00:29:02,883 --> 00:29:04,851
You got this, Otis.

532
00:29:06,253 --> 00:29:08,271
Any time.

533
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:23,235
Lights and siren... Lights and siren.

534
00:29:25,272 --> 00:29:27,372
Ooh!

535
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:37,849
Hey, you got a second?

536
00:29:37,918 --> 00:29:39,518
Course.

537
00:29:39,586 --> 00:29:42,387
Okay, so you know how everybody's got

538
00:29:42,456 --> 00:29:44,923
two angels on each shoulder,
one good, one bad?

539
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:47,059
Well, actually it's an angel and a devil,

540
00:29:47,127 --> 00:29:49,361
- but...
- Right... okay... so

541
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:52,030
you're the angel and Otis is the devil,

542
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:53,765
which is why I'm coming to you.

543
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,402
I need some good advice.

544
00:29:57,037 --> 00:30:00,323
'Kay. Lay it on me.

545
00:30:01,108 --> 00:30:04,709
Ha, uh, okay... So...

546
00:30:04,778 --> 00:30:07,079
There's this girl
I went to high school with.

547
00:30:07,147 --> 00:30:09,448
I'm well aware.

548
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:11,835
Go ahead.

549
00:30:13,169 --> 00:30:16,588
So, she's married. But... but!

550
00:30:16,657 --> 00:30:18,924
It's one of those things
where they're already talking

551
00:30:18,992 --> 00:30:21,393
about divorce
and there are no kids involved

552
00:30:21,462 --> 00:30:22,894
and the whole thing is pretty much

553
00:30:22,963 --> 00:30:24,229
on its last legs.

554
00:30:24,298 --> 00:30:27,409
- Okay...
- So we met up for a meal.

555
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,353
And at the end...

556
00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:35,974
I got the check and that was that.

557
00:30:36,743 --> 00:30:39,244
Well, that's not where
I thought this was going.

558
00:30:39,694 --> 00:30:41,079
Good, good for you, Jo.

559
00:30:41,148 --> 00:30:43,582
Right, except...

560
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,907
She said she's getting a hotel room

561
00:30:45,932 --> 00:30:48,288
at the Sofitel
and that we should meet there.

562
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,957
Relive the old days.

563
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,695
- What do I do?
- Seriously?

564
00:30:56,763 --> 00:30:58,430
You cannot go through with this.

565
00:30:58,499 --> 00:31:00,165
You're too good a guy.
You have too good a heart.

566
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:02,501
You are literally
one of the all-time catches

567
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,035
walking around Chicago, and this woman,

568
00:31:04,104 --> 00:31:07,405
whatever she's playing at,
she does not deserve you.

569
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,112
Umm...

570
00:31:14,356 --> 00:31:16,316
That was a strong opinion.

571
00:31:18,385 --> 00:31:21,363
Yeah... it-yeah. It is. It was.

572
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:24,199
Okay...

573
00:31:25,526 --> 00:31:27,869
That means a lot to me.

574
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:31,831
I will take what you said and I will...

575
00:31:32,874 --> 00:31:34,584
I will think about it.

576
00:31:36,303 --> 00:31:37,629
Hmm.

577
00:31:56,156 --> 00:31:57,656
Wallace. Kelly.

578
00:31:57,724 --> 00:31:59,862
Chief Grissom. What are you doing here?

579
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,493
You tell me. I got called down

580
00:32:01,518 --> 00:32:03,885
by the commissioner.
Something involving 51.

581
00:32:03,997 --> 00:32:06,198
Severide and I
received unmarked envelopes

582
00:32:06,223 --> 00:32:07,823
full of cash, 30,000 each.

583
00:32:07,935 --> 00:32:10,502
Why am I just hearing about this now?

584
00:32:10,571 --> 00:32:11,670
We went straight to legal with it.

585
00:32:11,738 --> 00:32:12,871
Didn't intend to blindside you.

586
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,739
But you did.

587
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:16,541
Whatever you're into, Wallace,
you keep me out of it,

588
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:18,510
you understand? I can't have any trouble.

589
00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:20,579
Not right now.

590
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,881
The commissioner will see you now.

591
00:32:39,212 --> 00:32:41,414
- Gentlemen.
- Commissioner.

592
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:43,813
I believe we've had a bit
of a misunderstanding.

593
00:32:43,815 --> 00:32:45,861
- Mea culpa.
- Tell 'em, Joe.

594
00:32:45,861 --> 00:32:48,629
And say it loud in case
the FBI is bugging my office.

595
00:32:48,631 --> 00:32:50,998
So I might have done a bad thing.

596
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,966
I... I wanted to show

597
00:32:53,035 --> 00:32:55,068
my appreciation for
what you did for my daughter,

598
00:32:55,137 --> 00:32:57,504
pulling her out of the
concrete, saving her and all.

599
00:32:57,573 --> 00:32:59,506
Where I was raised, Brooklyn, New York,

600
00:32:59,575 --> 00:33:02,309
you owe a man your life,
you slide a little money

601
00:33:02,378 --> 00:33:03,877
into an envelope, you press his palm.

602
00:33:03,902 --> 00:33:06,269
You say "How do you do?"
That type of thing.

603
00:33:06,382 --> 00:33:07,714
Apparently that's frowned upon
these days.

604
00:33:07,783 --> 00:33:09,549
Yeah, a little more than frowned upon.

605
00:33:09,618 --> 00:33:12,419
Like I said, my bad,
No one's got to know.

606
00:33:12,488 --> 00:33:15,689
The money, that we are not talking about,

607
00:33:15,758 --> 00:33:19,192
is in a box in my office under
lock and key, Mr. Pittman.

608
00:33:19,261 --> 00:33:21,395
You can come get it as soon as possible.

609
00:33:21,463 --> 00:33:23,063
If you want to make a donation

610
00:33:23,132 --> 00:33:24,865
to the 100 Club of Chicago,
no one's going to stop you.

611
00:33:24,933 --> 00:33:26,667
Hey, that's a thought,
I could put it in your names.

612
00:33:26,735 --> 00:33:29,503
Or you could send it anonymously.

613
00:33:29,571 --> 00:33:31,838
Save us any more attention.

614
00:33:31,907 --> 00:33:33,240
Understood.

615
00:33:33,309 --> 00:33:34,675
You need anything else from me, Bill?

616
00:33:34,743 --> 00:33:36,943
That's it. Thanks for clearing this up.

617
00:33:37,012 --> 00:33:39,167
Thanks, boys. Dismissed.

618
00:33:45,187 --> 00:33:46,853
Looks like we dodged a bullet there.

619
00:33:46,922 --> 00:33:48,055
Sure did.

620
00:33:48,123 --> 00:33:50,557
Sorry I got a little prickly before.

621
00:33:52,514 --> 00:33:54,361
"A little prickly."

622
00:33:54,891 --> 00:33:57,197
Is it just me or is he up to something?

623
00:33:57,266 --> 00:33:59,666
Gris is always up to something.

624
00:34:11,647 --> 00:34:13,980
Okay.

625
00:34:14,049 --> 00:34:15,615
I've made my decision.

626
00:34:15,684 --> 00:34:18,885
After much consideration
and taking into account

627
00:34:18,954 --> 00:34:20,721
- the fact...
- Before you reveal

628
00:34:20,789 --> 00:34:23,290
your choice, captain, would you mind

629
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,959
if I had a word with Otis real quick?

630
00:34:29,898 --> 00:34:31,177
Sure.

631
00:34:33,168 --> 00:34:35,936
Come on.

632
00:34:41,176 --> 00:34:43,343
What's it worth to you?

633
00:34:43,412 --> 00:34:44,511
What? Driving?

634
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,579
For me to back out.

635
00:34:45,647 --> 00:34:46,947
Look.

636
00:34:47,015 --> 00:34:48,682
He is going to pick my name.

637
00:34:48,751 --> 00:34:52,753
So this is my moment
for maximum leverage.

638
00:34:52,821 --> 00:34:54,421
Have you been dating a stockbroker

639
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:56,089
- when I wasn't looking?
- I'm asking...

640
00:34:56,158 --> 00:34:57,457
What's it worth to you?

641
00:34:57,526 --> 00:34:59,426
All my Saturday pick-ups at Molly's?

642
00:34:59,495 --> 00:35:02,596
Yeah, definitely.

643
00:35:02,664 --> 00:35:05,298
Rolling the hoses twice a month?

644
00:35:05,878 --> 00:35:06,959
Okay.

645
00:35:06,984 --> 00:35:08,602
And all my bathroom duties for a year.

646
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,303
- Too far.
- Okay... okay.

647
00:35:10,372 --> 00:35:13,340
Okay.

648
00:35:13,409 --> 00:35:18,011
First two and then I bow out.

649
00:35:19,181 --> 00:35:20,935
Deal.

650
00:35:22,785 --> 00:35:24,188
Deal.

651
00:35:28,323 --> 00:35:30,737
Captain.

652
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:35,862
We have reached a decision ourselves.

653
00:35:35,931 --> 00:35:38,198
I'm withdrawing my name
from consideration.

654
00:35:42,471 --> 00:35:45,071
Fine by me. Otis...

655
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,007
Back on as the driver.

656
00:35:49,378 --> 00:35:51,011
That's our boy!

657
00:35:56,151 --> 00:35:57,639
Captain!

658
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:02,556
Hey, I... I just wanted to say that

659
00:36:02,624 --> 00:36:04,591
I don't know whose name
you were going to pick...

660
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,727
This was just a scheme to get
Otis to do all your chores?

661
00:36:08,931 --> 00:36:11,331
Well...

662
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,166
Well played.

663
00:36:13,836 --> 00:36:17,270
Well, actually, I...
I just knew the sooner

664
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:18,872
that I could get
everyone back to treating

665
00:36:18,941 --> 00:36:21,211
Otis the way
that we always did, the better.

666
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,844
I figured, mixing it up with him

667
00:36:23,912 --> 00:36:25,512
was the best way to get
Herrmann and Mouch

668
00:36:25,581 --> 00:36:28,048
- back to normal.
- Huh.

669
00:36:28,116 --> 00:36:29,754
Double well-played, then.

670
00:36:31,453 --> 00:36:32,882
You know what?

671
00:36:34,032 --> 00:36:35,632
Would you like to drive the truck

672
00:36:35,657 --> 00:36:38,221
one last time before
you hand over the keys?

673
00:36:39,261 --> 00:36:40,640
Yeah.

674
00:36:42,865 --> 00:36:44,531
Hey, Connie.

675
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,701
When Mr. Joseph Pittman
arrives at the firehouse,

676
00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:49,691
will you be sure...

677
00:36:50,506 --> 00:36:53,573
To get him this box?

678
00:36:53,642 --> 00:36:55,275
He must have misplaced it.

679
00:36:55,344 --> 00:36:56,781
Got it.

680
00:37:00,115 --> 00:37:02,549
It's too bad, Chief. Could have made

681
00:37:02,618 --> 00:37:05,164
a nice down payment
on that boat you wanted.

682
00:37:06,154 --> 00:37:07,875
I already bought it.

683
00:37:08,557 --> 00:37:09,756
- No.
- Yeah.

684
00:37:09,825 --> 00:37:11,725
- No!
- Oh, yeah!

685
00:37:11,793 --> 00:37:13,460
- Really?
- Yep!

686
00:37:13,529 --> 00:37:15,428
I spent too much time back pedaling

687
00:37:15,497 --> 00:37:17,385
from the future, instead...

688
00:37:18,734 --> 00:37:21,001
I'm just going to get to living life.

689
00:37:21,069 --> 00:37:23,637
Well, hell, if living life
is you, me, and Casey

690
00:37:23,705 --> 00:37:25,238
fishing on the lake this summer,

691
00:37:25,307 --> 00:37:26,506
you count me in.

692
00:37:26,936 --> 00:37:28,938
You can be sure of that.

693
00:38:03,712 --> 00:38:06,646
Oh, my... Oh, wow.

694
00:38:06,715 --> 00:38:09,149
You look awesome.

695
00:38:09,217 --> 00:38:10,450
You must be Donovan?

696
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:11,818
Yes, ma'am. It's nice to meet you.

697
00:38:11,887 --> 00:38:14,192
Pleasure, Bria just about to...

698
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,861
Honey, you look amazing.

699
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,496
- Thank you.
- You do.

700
00:38:23,565 --> 00:38:25,632
You really do. Doesn't she?

701
00:38:27,569 --> 00:38:28,998
Oh!

702
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,774
Okay.

703
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,481
So... Matt and I thought maybe you guys

704
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:45,318
could arrive at the dance
in a way you'll never forget.

705
00:39:05,507 --> 00:39:06,773
Ha!

706
00:39:06,842 --> 00:39:10,610
Your chariot arrives!

707
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:13,209
Oh, my God. Thank you.

708
00:39:20,922 --> 00:39:25,221
Oh, my god! This is the best.

709
00:39:25,927 --> 00:39:29,229
So, this is my last ride for a while,

710
00:39:29,297 --> 00:39:30,930
ladies and gentlemen,
so you better believe

711
00:39:30,999 --> 00:39:33,233
we are going to get the siren going.

712
00:39:33,301 --> 00:39:35,235
- Whoo!
- All right?

713
00:39:39,641 --> 00:39:41,374
Bye, sweetheart! Have fun!

714
00:39:41,443 --> 00:39:43,710
Bye, have fun!

715
00:39:53,822 --> 00:39:56,623
I want to start trying again.

716
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,922
Yeah?

717
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:15,040

1
00:00:00,661 --> 00:00:03,411
- Who is that?
- Her name's Renee.

2
00:00:03,474 --> 00:00:06,059
She told Severide
she was carrying his baby,

3
00:00:06,114 --> 00:00:07,837
even though she knew
it was someone else's.

4
00:00:07,903 --> 00:00:11,171
I moved back to take the lead
in a pro Bono case,

5
00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:12,933
but I could really use some help.

6
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:14,951
Colannino, where'd you go?

7
00:00:14,976 --> 00:00:16,021
I gotta get him, Chief.

8
00:00:16,069 --> 00:00:17,469
Herrmann!

9
00:00:17,537 --> 00:00:20,793
He was headed back in, looking for me.

10
00:00:20,863 --> 00:00:22,155
Commissioner!

11
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:23,797
I want to make sure
I leave this department

12
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:25,799
in the hands of someone
who loves it as much as I do.

13
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,568
<i>My friends at school
have moms to help...</i>

14
00:00:28,637 --> 00:00:30,137
Well, now you have me.

15
00:00:30,205 --> 00:00:33,573
I want to start trying again.

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,427
We, uh...

17
00:00:53,495 --> 00:00:56,383
Have a little time
before our shift starts.

18
00:00:56,415 --> 00:01:00,050
Any chance I can lure you back to the...

19
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,685
Bedroom?

20
00:01:01,754 --> 00:01:03,921
Let's go.

21
00:01:06,826 --> 00:01:09,860
It's such a burden
trying to get pregnant.

22
00:01:09,929 --> 00:01:11,929
Oh, yeah, it's really a chore.

23
00:01:17,838 --> 00:01:19,838
In the open layout of the body shop,

24
00:01:19,907 --> 00:01:22,507
vehicles lined up,
one looking like the next

25
00:01:22,576 --> 00:01:24,276
in a low-visibility environment,

26
00:01:24,345 --> 00:01:28,213
it's easy to understand how the
firefighters got disoriented.

27
00:01:28,282 --> 00:01:30,315
The panel feels
it would be irresponsible

28
00:01:30,384 --> 00:01:32,985
to assign any blame in the tragic death

29
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:34,453
of Lieutenant Colannino.

30
00:01:34,521 --> 00:01:37,055
Maybe we could use this tragedy

31
00:01:37,124 --> 00:01:39,291
as a learning opportunity,

32
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,127
incorporate the scenario
into academy training

33
00:01:42,196 --> 00:01:44,463
and active duty drills.

34
00:01:44,531 --> 00:01:46,298
Make sure it never happens again.

35
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:48,967
That's a great idea, Chief. Thank you.

36
00:01:49,036 --> 00:01:51,270
Okay.

37
00:01:55,309 --> 00:01:57,309
- Hey.
- Hey.

38
00:01:57,378 --> 00:02:00,579
Are you bucking for
Commissioner Staton's job?

39
00:02:00,648 --> 00:02:03,215
Yes, I am.

40
00:02:03,284 --> 00:02:04,683
Good.

41
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,320
You know, I love this department.

42
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,856
I just can't
sit on the sidelines anymore,

43
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:13,525
hope someone else takes care of it.

44
00:02:13,594 --> 00:02:15,827
Deputy Commissioner Nelson
thought he had it wrapped up.

45
00:02:15,896 --> 00:02:17,529
Now he's got to worry about you two.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,401
You're putting yourself up
for commissioner.

47
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:25,237
I made a case for myself, yeah, why?

48
00:02:25,306 --> 00:02:26,892
Um...

49
00:02:28,242 --> 00:02:30,275
- You?
- Look, I know.

50
00:02:30,344 --> 00:02:33,312
No, no, no, no. That's great.

51
00:02:34,348 --> 00:02:36,348
May the best man win.

52
00:02:41,288 --> 00:02:44,122
So that closes the investigation

53
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:46,725
into Colannino's death.

54
00:02:46,794 --> 00:02:48,627
But I know well enough
that the pain of it

55
00:02:48,696 --> 00:02:51,458
will stay with us for a long, long time.

56
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:54,231
Some more than others.

57
00:02:55,302 --> 00:02:57,769
But we still have a city to protect.

58
00:02:57,838 --> 00:03:01,974
Let's focus on the job
that's in front of us.

59
00:03:02,042 --> 00:03:04,162
You stay safe out there.

60
00:03:04,845 --> 00:03:07,946
Keep an eye on one another, as always.

61
00:03:08,015 --> 00:03:10,082
Will do, Chief.

62
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,416
Let's get to it.

63
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:21,093
Did you get any sleep at all last night?

64
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:22,394
What do you mean? Sure.

65
00:03:22,463 --> 00:03:24,596
Dude, I heard you pacing around.

66
00:03:24,665 --> 00:03:26,431
Oh, maybe a little, but I'm fine.

67
00:03:28,002 --> 00:03:30,836
<i>Truck 81, Ambulance 61, person injured.</i>

68
00:03:30,904 --> 00:03:32,437
<i>North Campbell and West Haddon.</i>

69
00:03:48,922 --> 00:03:51,456
Doesn't look like the tree hit him.

70
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:54,092
Hey, where's the driver?

71
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:55,460
<i>He went to knock on doors.</i>

72
00:03:55,529 --> 00:03:56,595
<i>He thought the neighbors might know</i>

73
00:03:56,663 --> 00:03:58,196
<i>who the boy's parents are.</i>

74
00:03:58,265 --> 00:04:00,265
Hello, is someone on the phone?

75
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:01,933
<i>This is Onstar Emergency.</i>

76
00:04:02,002 --> 00:04:04,336
<i>I'm the one who contacted
the 911 center.</i>

77
00:04:04,405 --> 00:04:07,305
I'm Captain Matt Casey with
the Chicago Fire Department.

78
00:04:07,374 --> 00:04:09,041
What boy are you talking about?

79
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:11,109
<i>The driver of the vehicle
said the tree came down</i>

80
00:04:11,178 --> 00:04:13,924
<i>on the little boy,
and he looks badly hurt.</i>

81
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,614
<i>The driver couldn't get to him.</i>

82
00:04:15,682 --> 00:04:17,900
<i>The boy wasn't responding.</i>

83
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:21,053
Right here!

84
00:04:22,942 --> 00:04:27,295
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx

85
00:04:28,796 --> 00:04:31,296
- Mouch, get some cribbing.
- Got you, Captain.

86
00:04:31,365 --> 00:04:32,697
Otis, grab the 12-foot ladder.

87
00:04:32,766 --> 00:04:35,934
- Copy.
- We're going to make a lever.

88
00:04:40,474 --> 00:04:41,907
Is he responsive?

89
00:04:44,144 --> 00:04:46,845
I don't know yet.

90
00:04:48,148 --> 00:04:50,849
Hey, buddy. Can you hear me?

91
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:53,085
Okay, huh?

92
00:04:53,153 --> 00:04:55,854
He's breathing, but barely.

93
00:04:55,923 --> 00:04:57,656
Jackson!

94
00:04:57,724 --> 00:04:59,758
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Is he okay?

95
00:04:59,827 --> 00:05:01,560
Let them work, ma'am; these
guys know what they're doing.

96
00:05:01,628 --> 00:05:03,095
He's breathing, but he's unconscious.

97
00:05:03,163 --> 00:05:04,563
Oh, my God.

98
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:06,198
- Did you see what happened?
- Yeah.

99
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:08,667
The wind picked up and
the tree started blowing over.

100
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,836
I hit the brakes, but
the kid never saw it coming.

101
00:05:10,904 --> 00:05:12,537
I hit the Onstar emergency button

102
00:05:12,606 --> 00:05:14,172
and I had them call for help
while I jumped out

103
00:05:14,241 --> 00:05:17,008
and tried to get to him,
but... I couldn't reach him.

104
00:05:17,077 --> 00:05:19,911
Hey, Jackson. Hey, Jackson.

105
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,746
Can you hear me?

106
00:05:21,815 --> 00:05:24,049
Okay, hang in here, buddy, all right?

107
00:05:24,118 --> 00:05:26,952
We're going to get you out, okay?

108
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,188
All right, yeah...
Hey, what's taking so long?

109
00:05:30,257 --> 00:05:33,024
- Let's give them some room.
- Yeah, we're almost there.

110
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,098
Hey, on three. One, two, three.

111
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,039
It's good, it's good.

112
00:05:48,108 --> 00:05:50,942
All right, come on. I got him.

113
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:53,269
Let's pull him out nice and easy.

114
00:05:53,331 --> 00:05:56,047
- Slide.
- Be careful with him!

115
00:05:56,116 --> 00:05:58,283
Little more, right there. All right.

116
00:05:58,352 --> 00:05:59,818
All right, we're clear.

117
00:05:59,887 --> 00:06:01,887
Oh, God...

118
00:06:01,955 --> 00:06:03,421
We'll roll him over on my count.

119
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,291
One, two, three.

120
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,200
Nice and easy.

121
00:06:09,186 --> 00:06:10,832
Okay...

122
00:06:13,092 --> 00:06:15,133
- Okay, good?
- Yeah.

123
00:06:20,407 --> 00:06:22,607
Jackson, can you hear me?

124
00:06:26,013 --> 00:06:28,180
- GCS is seven.
- Lungs are diminished.

125
00:06:28,248 --> 00:06:29,806
Let's go.

126
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:44,429
You did good, Hermann.

127
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,774
Hey, how is he?

128
00:06:55,842 --> 00:06:57,609
Oh, our good Samaritan.

129
00:06:57,678 --> 00:06:59,945
Um, they don't know anything yet.

130
00:07:00,013 --> 00:07:02,180
They're sending him into CT,
checking for brain trauma.

131
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:04,616
His mom's in there with him now.

132
00:07:04,685 --> 00:07:06,782
I know nobody owes me any information,

133
00:07:06,837 --> 00:07:08,944
but I feel for the kid, you know?

134
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,388
He looked like he was having
the time of his life

135
00:07:10,457 --> 00:07:13,124
- out there, scooting along.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

136
00:07:13,193 --> 00:07:16,127
We don't generally get to hear
how these things turn out, so.

137
00:07:16,196 --> 00:07:18,797
Sure, you drop them off,
you do the paperwork

138
00:07:18,865 --> 00:07:19,998
while your partner restocks the rig,

139
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:21,566
and off you go to the next call.

140
00:07:21,635 --> 00:07:23,702
Are you a first responder?

141
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,837
I was going to be a firefighter,

142
00:07:25,906 --> 00:07:28,240
but I hurt my neck at the academy.

143
00:07:28,308 --> 00:07:30,642
Dashed my hopes and dreams, so.

144
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:32,210
This is all back home in Indianapolis.

145
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,179
- Ah, a Hoosier.
- Yeah.

146
00:07:34,248 --> 00:07:36,848
And now, I'm a
civilian employee for the IFD.

147
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:40,018
Handle all of their equipment purchases.

148
00:07:40,087 --> 00:07:41,753
Seriously?

149
00:07:41,822 --> 00:07:45,023
Yeah, it's not that exciting.

150
00:07:45,092 --> 00:07:48,526
Uh, yeah, it is.

151
00:07:49,663 --> 00:07:51,997
I'm hopeful that the boy
is going to be okay.

152
00:07:52,065 --> 00:07:53,498
It's, um...

153
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:54,833
Just weighing a lot on Hermann.

154
00:07:54,901 --> 00:07:56,434
Just keep doing what you're doing.

155
00:07:56,503 --> 00:07:58,036
- Mm.
- Staying close.

156
00:07:58,105 --> 00:08:01,172
- That is my plan.
- He'll be okay.

157
00:08:02,576 --> 00:08:05,210
- Hey, hey...
- Yes?

158
00:08:11,451 --> 00:08:14,452
- I had a thought.
- Hmm?

159
00:08:21,528 --> 00:08:25,230
That is so funny.
I had the same thought.

160
00:08:36,543 --> 00:08:38,743
- Hi.
- Hey.

161
00:08:38,812 --> 00:08:41,579
Connie told me to just bang on the door.

162
00:08:41,648 --> 00:08:43,715
I hope that's okay. I'm... I'm Renee.

163
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:46,384
I'm an old friend of Kelly's.

164
00:08:46,453 --> 00:08:48,553
Yes, good to... good to meet you.

165
00:08:48,622 --> 00:08:50,288
Sorry I didn't introduce you before.

166
00:08:50,357 --> 00:08:52,257
This is Stella, my girlfriend.

167
00:08:52,326 --> 00:08:54,926
Well, it's very good
to meet you, Stella.

168
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:57,896
Um, I just wanted to follow up
on the refinery case.

169
00:08:57,964 --> 00:09:00,565
I can come back
if now's not a good time.

170
00:09:00,634 --> 00:09:02,500
No, no, no, no. Talk oil refineries.

171
00:09:02,569 --> 00:09:07,972
I have got a driver's side
compartment to do, so yes.

172
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,175
- I'll, uh, I'll see you around.
- I hope so.

173
00:09:10,243 --> 00:09:12,510
Yeah.

174
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,780
- Come on in.
- So, um...

175
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:18,783
Did you get a chance
to look the files over?

176
00:09:18,852 --> 00:09:21,019
Yeah, I did, and from what I read,

177
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:23,621
the refinery definitely
made some missteps.

178
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,635
So...

179
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,525
You'll help us out?

180
00:09:27,594 --> 00:09:29,793
Yeah, yeah.

181
00:09:30,097 --> 00:09:32,931
- Yeah, why not?
- Okay, good, thank you.

182
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:36,134
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, tomorrow.

183
00:09:36,203 --> 00:09:38,269
I have meetings all day tomorrow.

184
00:09:38,338 --> 00:09:40,805
So could you meet me
at my place in the evening?

185
00:09:40,874 --> 00:09:42,941
And then I can talk you
through your first steps.

186
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:44,913
Does that work for you?

187
00:09:46,012 --> 00:09:48,947
Yeah, I have to get back home
for Nicholas,

188
00:09:49,015 --> 00:09:52,817
or else I would say that we
could just meet up at the firm.

189
00:09:52,886 --> 00:09:54,953
When I went back to work,
I made a promise to myself

190
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:58,656
that I would always be there
for him by bedtime.

191
00:09:58,725 --> 00:10:02,994
Yeah, sounds good. Um, that works.

192
00:10:05,465 --> 00:10:07,799
It'd be pretty cool
if Boden made commissioner.

193
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:10,235
No kidding. 51 would be on easy street.

194
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,670
Our former battalion chief
running the whole CFD?

195
00:10:12,739 --> 00:10:14,072
Forget about it.

196
00:10:14,141 --> 00:10:15,740
What do you think
his chances are, though?

197
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:18,343
Realistically speaking.

198
00:10:18,412 --> 00:10:21,146
Old guys, I'm asking you.

199
00:10:21,214 --> 00:10:23,548
Well, he's an underdog for sure,

200
00:10:23,617 --> 00:10:25,650
but he's got a real shot.

201
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:27,986
- What do you say, Hermann?
- Huh?

202
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:31,556
Oh, you didn't hear him
address us as "old guys"?

203
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,396
Hey, um, Brett.

204
00:10:34,327 --> 00:10:37,028
What's the word on
that... that little kid?

205
00:10:37,097 --> 00:10:39,497
Concussion, broken
collarbone, couple of ribs.

206
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:41,433
But the helmet protected him
from the worst of it.

207
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:44,002
Prognosis is good; he'll be
back on his scooter in no time.

208
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,404
Yeah, that's good to hear.

209
00:10:46,473 --> 00:10:49,707
It was a good save, Herrmann.
It was a real good save.

210
00:10:49,776 --> 00:10:52,110
And guess what else?

211
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:53,945
The good Samaritan who was on our call?

212
00:10:54,014 --> 00:10:56,548
His name is Glenn,
and he's an equipment buyer

213
00:10:56,616 --> 00:10:58,716
for the Indianapolis Fire Department.

214
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:00,211
Seriously? What's he doing here?

215
00:11:00,274 --> 00:11:01,519
He's in town, meeting with a couple

216
00:11:01,588 --> 00:11:03,087
of fire equipment manufacturers.

217
00:11:03,156 --> 00:11:05,523
I told him about the Slamigan,
and he's interested.

218
00:11:05,592 --> 00:11:07,192
- Oh!
- He is?

219
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,694
Yeah, he wants to stop by
for a demonstration later.

220
00:11:09,763 --> 00:11:12,697
- Later, like, today later?
- Yeah.

221
00:11:12,766 --> 00:11:14,265
Yeah!

222
00:11:14,334 --> 00:11:17,068
Hey, you better be ready,
Cruz... don't blow this.

223
00:11:17,137 --> 00:11:19,804
Or maybe we bring Nick Porter
in to handle the sale?

224
00:11:19,873 --> 00:11:21,372
Hey, Cruz isn't going to blow it.

225
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:23,641
Thank you, I'm glad to see that someone

226
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,543
still has a little faith in me.

227
00:11:28,882 --> 00:11:31,616
Yeah, he's going to blow it.

228
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:33,871
Thank you.

229
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:37,555
I know you're busy and, uh...

230
00:11:37,624 --> 00:11:40,592
This may be a lot of work.

231
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,260
But I appreciate you doing this

232
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:46,631
despite, you know, the baggage.

233
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,666
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

234
00:11:48,735 --> 00:11:51,769
- Text me your address.
- Okay.

235
00:11:59,346 --> 00:12:01,071
Lieutenant!

236
00:12:04,084 --> 00:12:06,584
Grizz, hey, what's up?

237
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:09,254
The full court press.

238
00:12:09,322 --> 00:12:11,256
- Sorry?
- That's the description

239
00:12:11,324 --> 00:12:12,824
I keep hearing
about how you pushed Boden

240
00:12:12,893 --> 00:12:14,492
into his quest for commissioner.

241
00:12:14,561 --> 00:12:17,028
That he wouldn't even have
the idea if it wasn't for you,

242
00:12:17,097 --> 00:12:19,597
and why would he? A battalion chief?

243
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,266
Grizz, I didn't think
that you were after the job.

244
00:12:21,334 --> 00:12:23,368
You knew he wasn't,
but that didn't stop you

245
00:12:23,436 --> 00:12:25,336
from singing his praises
to every white shirt

246
00:12:25,405 --> 00:12:28,506
who would listen.
It's not his time, okay?

247
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:30,842
It's my time, and let me tell
you something, old friend.

248
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:33,311
You are going to wish you
hadn't stabbed me in the back.

249
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,873
I should have realized

250
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,950
when Grizz pumped the brakes
on his retirement,

251
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,332
that this was why.

252
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,735
He must have known
that Staten was on his way out.

253
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:52,931
That's why he stuck around:

254
00:12:53,002 --> 00:12:54,401
to make a play for commissioner.

255
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,480
Sorry for roping you
into his mess, Severide.

256
00:12:56,558 --> 00:12:58,426
You didn't rope me into anything.
I did it for Boden.

257
00:12:58,451 --> 00:12:59,495
It was my choice.

258
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,269
Then you don't need to do any more.

259
00:13:01,316 --> 00:13:02,724
Just keep your head down,
and don't screw up

260
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,173
- your relationship with Grissom.
- I already screwed it up.

261
00:13:05,276 --> 00:13:08,010
Then fix it somehow. It's not too late.

262
00:13:09,135 --> 00:13:11,148
You mean a lot to him.

263
00:13:12,204 --> 00:13:14,838
A bond like that doesn't
just disappear overnight.

264
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:19,176
Try and do a good deed, you know?

265
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,480
Welcome to politics.

266
00:13:30,322 --> 00:13:32,456
The Slamigan. Patented.

267
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:34,725
Wow, let me see that thing.

268
00:13:36,595 --> 00:13:38,295
- It's pretty heavy.
- Damn straight.

269
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:39,796
That's quality construction,

270
00:13:39,865 --> 00:13:42,833
thanks to our chief fabricator,
Sylvie Brett.

271
00:13:42,902 --> 00:13:45,836
Now, the Slamigan
lets a single firefighter

272
00:13:45,905 --> 00:13:48,939
perform a forcible entry,
thereby maximizing the efficacy

273
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:50,174
of the entire company.

274
00:13:50,242 --> 00:13:52,309
Someone bought himself a thesaurus.

275
00:13:52,378 --> 00:13:54,378
I think you have something here.

276
00:13:54,446 --> 00:13:55,846
I think we can all agree
firefighters are going to go

277
00:13:55,915 --> 00:13:57,314
crazy for the name.

278
00:13:57,383 --> 00:13:59,816
I mean, the Slamigan?
That's just badass.

279
00:13:59,885 --> 00:14:01,785
Let me talk to Indianapolis,
see if there's any interest.

280
00:14:01,854 --> 00:14:04,288
Thanks for the show and tell,
Joe; I'll be in touch.

281
00:14:04,356 --> 00:14:05,722
Oh, thank you for coming by, Glenn.

282
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,659
Here, have a shirt.
What are you, a large?

283
00:14:08,727 --> 00:14:09,893
Yeah.

284
00:14:09,962 --> 00:14:11,895
- Here.
- Neat, thanks.

285
00:14:11,964 --> 00:14:14,698
Yeah, I'll walk you out.
I'm actually from Indiana, too.

286
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:16,133
Fowlerton.

287
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:18,035
I knew there was a reason I liked you.

288
00:14:24,743 --> 00:14:26,843
"Efficacy"?

289
00:14:29,148 --> 00:14:31,548
My dad's now set me
two messages about Grizz,

290
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:33,550
and how personally he's taking all this.

291
00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:37,221
For tough guy firefighters,
they got pretty thin skin.

292
00:14:37,289 --> 00:14:38,755
It's not like I don't appreciate

293
00:14:38,824 --> 00:14:40,557
everything Grizz did for me
when I was coming up.

294
00:14:40,626 --> 00:14:43,594
But the past is in the past,
and this is about now.

295
00:14:43,662 --> 00:14:46,196
And Boden is the right man for the job.

296
00:14:46,265 --> 00:14:48,865
- Simple as that.
- Yeah.

297
00:14:50,436 --> 00:14:52,369
Look, we got to get your mind off this.

298
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:54,738
So why don't you let your girlfriend

299
00:14:54,807 --> 00:14:57,774
ply you with sports and alcohol tonight?

300
00:14:57,843 --> 00:14:59,910
There's a great dive over by Hermann's,

301
00:14:59,979 --> 00:15:01,511
and they've always
got the Cubbies on TV.

302
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,280
- All right, now we're talking.
- Okay.

303
00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:05,582
Hey, do you mind if we do it
later, maybe around nine?

304
00:15:05,651 --> 00:15:07,684
I have to meet Renee
after she's done with work

305
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:10,320
- to talk over the case.
- Sure.

306
00:15:12,725 --> 00:15:15,626
Is it weird at all seeing her again?

307
00:15:15,694 --> 00:15:18,095
I mean, we don't have
to talk about it, I just...

308
00:15:18,163 --> 00:15:20,397
No, it's a little bit weird, I guess.

309
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:22,699
But it was a long time ago.

310
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:26,603
And the past is in the past.

311
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,774
- Ancient history.
- Okay.

312
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:46,290
So?

313
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:51,087
Not pregnant.

314
00:15:53,132 --> 00:15:55,775
At least, not yet.

315
00:15:56,782 --> 00:15:58,165
Yeah, well.

316
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:03,173
What I'm hearing you say is
we need to double our efforts.

317
00:16:03,242 --> 00:16:04,399
- Double?
- Mm-hmm.

318
00:16:04,438 --> 00:16:05,942
Bold.

319
00:16:06,011 --> 00:16:07,944
That does sound kind of fun,
though, I've got to admit.

320
00:16:08,013 --> 00:16:09,780
It will be.

321
00:16:09,848 --> 00:16:13,317
And since I'm a classy kind of guy,

322
00:16:13,385 --> 00:16:15,485
I'm going to take you out
for a classy dinner

323
00:16:15,554 --> 00:16:17,854
and a classy bottle of wine first.

324
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:22,755
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

325
00:16:23,062 --> 00:16:24,677
Oh.

326
00:16:25,264 --> 00:16:27,464
Then I guess I'd better get dressed up

327
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:30,033
in a classy little black dress.

328
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,481
You sure you don't want a beer?

329
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,683
No, I'm good, thanks.

330
00:16:49,655 --> 00:16:53,623
That's Marco. That's Nicholas' father.

331
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,673
Ah.

332
00:16:57,596 --> 00:17:00,664
I've spent the last five
years going back and forth

333
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:03,072
to Madrid with Nicholas, trying
to get his father in his life,

334
00:17:03,142 --> 00:17:06,056
but Marco's kind of
an overgrown kid himself.

335
00:17:06,134 --> 00:17:09,564
He... he owns a bunch of bars.
He's always out late, partying.

336
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:12,376
He's never really been there for Nicky

337
00:17:12,444 --> 00:17:14,544
in any kind of real way.

338
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:16,540
I'm sorry to hear that.

339
00:17:17,149 --> 00:17:20,317
We probably won't even bother
to go back this summer.

340
00:17:22,154 --> 00:17:24,588
I worked a chemical fire

341
00:17:24,656 --> 00:17:26,757
that had a lot of
the same characteristics.

342
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:29,393
I'm not sure it'll help,
but I can stop by

343
00:17:29,461 --> 00:17:34,064
OFI tomorrow,
and pull some files to compare.

344
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:36,566
Oh, absolutely this will help.

345
00:17:36,635 --> 00:17:39,202
- Hi!
- Hey there.

346
00:17:39,271 --> 00:17:40,404
Hey, you.

347
00:17:40,472 --> 00:17:42,672
Is your movie over already?

348
00:17:44,209 --> 00:17:45,675
Where are we going?

349
00:17:45,744 --> 00:17:47,744
He told me he wanted
to show you his toys.

350
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:54,484
Wow, cool room, bud.

351
00:17:57,256 --> 00:17:59,589
- Hey.
- What have you got here?

352
00:17:59,658 --> 00:18:02,192
Yeah, that one, look.

353
00:18:02,261 --> 00:18:03,894
Hey, what happened to your bed?

354
00:18:03,962 --> 00:18:06,696
I jumped on it a lot by mistake.

355
00:18:06,765 --> 00:18:08,632
- By mistake, huh?
- Mm.

356
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,634
Well, someone's coming
to fix it tomorrow,

357
00:18:10,702 --> 00:18:12,569
but he's got to sleep
on the floor tonight,

358
00:18:12,638 --> 00:18:14,538
which he's not too happy about.

359
00:18:14,606 --> 00:18:16,873
There are spiders on the floor.

360
00:18:16,942 --> 00:18:18,208
Well, I tell you what, I got a toolbox

361
00:18:18,277 --> 00:18:19,476
in the back of my trunk.

362
00:18:19,545 --> 00:18:21,611
I could fix that for you, if you want.

363
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,779
Yes!

364
00:18:26,351 --> 00:18:28,285
Well, I'd better get my tools out.

365
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,796
That was...

366
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,568
He's usually not that affectionate

367
00:18:44,636 --> 00:18:47,170
with anyone else besides me.

368
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:51,074
- He really likes you.
- He's fun; he's a good kid.

369
00:18:53,312 --> 00:18:55,946
Kelly.

370
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,750
I just want to say I'm so sorry.

371
00:19:01,987 --> 00:19:03,320
For everything.

372
00:19:03,388 --> 00:19:05,892
- You don't have to...
- No, I do.

373
00:19:06,725 --> 00:19:08,925
I wasn't in my right mind.

374
00:19:10,662 --> 00:19:14,172
And the way that I acted

375
00:19:15,102 --> 00:19:17,438
was unforgivable.

376
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:23,507
I appreciate you saying that.

377
00:19:23,575 --> 00:19:26,576
I wish things had gone differently.

378
00:19:30,682 --> 00:19:31,882
I'm going to grab my tools,

379
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,423
and then I'm going to hit the road.

380
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,774
Okay.

381
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,140
Of course. Okay.

382
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:58,595
Hey, I finally got the replacement

383
00:19:58,665 --> 00:19:59,997
for that overhead fixture.

384
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,999
It's frosted this time.
It's pretty nice, right?

385
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:05,069
It is perfect
for collecting dead bugs, yes.

386
00:20:05,138 --> 00:20:07,476
Okay, I was about to bust in.

387
00:20:07,523 --> 00:20:09,340
I thought you were going out
with Severide tonight.

388
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,509
Yeah, he called.
He's running a little late.

389
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,911
He says he'll be here by 10:00.

390
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,615
He's just helping Renee's kid
with something.

391
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:22,186
Helping a little kid, huh?
What a jerk that Severide is.

392
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:25,363
- Well, the kid is not the problem.
- It's...

393
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:29,479
There's just something
about Renee, I just don't...

394
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:31,073
I just get a bad hit.

395
00:20:31,161 --> 00:20:33,643
Uh, yeah, because she's a wackadoo.

396
00:20:33,714 --> 00:20:36,259
No, that's the thing, I'm...

397
00:20:36,328 --> 00:20:38,161
I'm not so sure she is.

398
00:20:39,497 --> 00:20:43,032
All right, listen, enough
sitting around here brooding.

399
00:20:43,101 --> 00:20:45,001
All right, you're going to give
this place a bad energy.

400
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,503
- I'm not brooding.
- Yes, you are.

401
00:20:47,572 --> 00:20:50,173
All right, and I got a better
use for your time, all right?

402
00:20:50,242 --> 00:20:53,343
Cindy, she went
to her book club tonight,

403
00:20:53,411 --> 00:20:55,278
and the kids are killing me, all right?

404
00:20:55,347 --> 00:20:56,980
Luke needs help with his homework,

405
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,982
Kenny will not come out of the bathroom,

406
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,185
and Annabelle is asking me
to do something called

407
00:21:02,254 --> 00:21:04,354
a mermaid braid,
whatever the hell that is.

408
00:21:04,422 --> 00:21:09,125
Okay, you are just asking me
for help out of pity.

409
00:21:09,194 --> 00:21:14,197
But I will admit that I am
highly gifted at braiding.

410
00:21:15,735 --> 00:21:18,002
- Let's go.
- Okay.

411
00:21:19,572 --> 00:21:21,605
It's not like I thought it
would happen overnight, but...

412
00:21:21,674 --> 00:21:23,274
Here you go.

413
00:21:23,343 --> 00:21:26,610
Since we decided to go for it,
waiting seems impossible.

414
00:21:28,147 --> 00:21:31,282
Classic Gabby Dawson.
It's also kind of sweet.

415
00:21:31,351 --> 00:21:33,784
Didn't you have a friend
who saw a fertility doctor?

416
00:21:33,853 --> 00:21:35,786
Yeah, yeah, my old neighbor, Allison.

417
00:21:35,855 --> 00:21:37,221
She and her husband tried for years

418
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,989
before they ended up there, though.

419
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:40,925
Did the treatments work?

420
00:21:40,993 --> 00:21:42,460
I don't remember how long it took,

421
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,563
but she has a beautiful little girl now.

422
00:21:45,631 --> 00:21:48,766
- Aw, that's good to hear.
- Oh, he's here.

423
00:21:48,835 --> 00:21:50,835
- Wish us luck.
- Knock 'em dead.

424
00:21:50,903 --> 00:21:52,470
- Sylvie.
- Hey, Glenn!

425
00:21:52,538 --> 00:21:54,138
- Have a seat.
- Hey.

426
00:21:54,207 --> 00:21:55,673
Joe.

427
00:21:55,742 --> 00:21:57,475
This looks like a pretty fun place.

428
00:21:57,543 --> 00:21:58,843
A real firefighter hangout.

429
00:21:58,911 --> 00:22:00,978
Eh, it's a home away from home.

430
00:22:01,047 --> 00:22:02,446
Uh, how'd it go?

431
00:22:02,515 --> 00:22:04,982
The conversation with Indianapolis?

432
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:07,084
Here's the thing, my boss
is a little reluctant

433
00:22:07,153 --> 00:22:08,486
to invest too much

434
00:22:08,554 --> 00:22:10,855
in a relatively untested
piece of equipment.

435
00:22:10,923 --> 00:22:13,524
Oh, okay.

436
00:22:13,593 --> 00:22:14,992
We still want to buy some,

437
00:22:15,061 --> 00:22:17,495
but I have to limit it
to one unit per company.

438
00:22:17,563 --> 00:22:21,265
- How many would that be?
- Let's see, um...

439
00:22:21,334 --> 00:22:23,701
Five squads, six rescue companies,

440
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:26,537
plus trucks and engines...

441
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:28,139
73, all in?

442
00:22:28,207 --> 00:22:31,175
I know that's probably not what
you were hoping for, but...

443
00:22:31,244 --> 00:22:35,446
No, no, it's fine. It's just, um...

444
00:22:35,515 --> 00:22:37,548
We have to talk to our partners
to figure out

445
00:22:37,617 --> 00:22:42,353
an appropriate cost per unit
for an order that small.

446
00:22:42,422 --> 00:22:45,289
No sweat, Joe, crunch some
numbers and get back to me.

447
00:22:45,358 --> 00:22:47,191
Great.

448
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,460
This is so cool. We should celebrate.

449
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:54,064
Um, nobody move.
I'm going to order a round.

450
00:22:54,133 --> 00:22:58,135
Hey, Joe, what's her story? Sylvie?

451
00:22:58,204 --> 00:23:00,298
Does she have a boyfriend?

452
00:23:01,474 --> 00:23:03,340
Uh, no.

453
00:23:03,409 --> 00:23:05,543
No, she doesn't.

454
00:23:11,451 --> 00:23:13,520
- Anywhere?
- Yeah, yeah.

455
00:23:13,591 --> 00:23:15,019
Make yourself comfortable.

456
00:23:15,087 --> 00:23:17,922
Is this the first time
we have been face to face

457
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:20,057
since you pulled my ass
out of that fire?

458
00:23:20,126 --> 00:23:21,725
Yeah, sounds about right.

459
00:23:23,129 --> 00:23:24,862
Well, it's very good to see you again.

460
00:23:24,931 --> 00:23:28,065
I am a big fan, you can imagine.

461
00:23:28,134 --> 00:23:30,401
Well, always good to see you too, Dale.

462
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:33,437
Look, I know it's a little audacious

463
00:23:33,506 --> 00:23:35,606
of me to throw my hat in the ring.

464
00:23:35,675 --> 00:23:39,910
It's a big step up, big,
but CFD is my family.

465
00:23:39,979 --> 00:23:41,445
I'd give my life for it.

466
00:23:41,514 --> 00:23:44,081
I nearly have more times
than I care to mention.

467
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,851
- I remember my first day at...
- Chief.

468
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:48,552
The mayor knows who you are.

469
00:23:48,621 --> 00:23:50,554
You don't need to sell yourself to us.

470
00:23:50,623 --> 00:23:54,024
- Your men already did that.
- Then why am I here?

471
00:23:54,093 --> 00:23:55,593
We need to dig in to your background,

472
00:23:55,661 --> 00:23:57,628
both your career and your personal life,

473
00:23:57,697 --> 00:23:59,463
so that we can be sure
nothing will come out

474
00:23:59,532 --> 00:24:03,167
that will embarrass the mayor
or the city of Chicago.

475
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,270
It's all pro forma.

476
00:24:06,339 --> 00:24:09,693
We have to vet everyone
on the mayor's short list.

477
00:24:10,643 --> 00:24:12,162
I'm on the short list?

478
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,013
Oh, yeah. You sure are.

479
00:24:18,951 --> 00:24:21,385
Lose all this baloney
and get right to the statement

480
00:24:21,454 --> 00:24:24,324
about the budget surplus, right?

481
00:24:25,057 --> 00:24:27,825
Hey, Benny's son.
What are you doing here?

482
00:24:27,894 --> 00:24:29,393
Commissioner, hi.

483
00:24:29,462 --> 00:24:32,096
I'm waiting for OFI to copy some files

484
00:24:32,164 --> 00:24:34,265
for a legal case that I'm... I'm...

485
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,379
It's not important. How are you, sir?

486
00:24:36,457 --> 00:24:40,070
Hey, I'm busy, you know?
Busy, busy, busy.

487
00:24:40,139 --> 00:24:42,606
Go on ahead. I'll be right there.

488
00:24:42,675 --> 00:24:45,643
- Yes, sir.
- Hey, sit with me a minute.

489
00:24:47,313 --> 00:24:51,081
So I understand you came up
under Carl Grissom.

490
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,650
Yeah.

491
00:24:52,718 --> 00:24:55,953
The mayor's asking me
to recommend my replacement.

492
00:24:56,022 --> 00:24:59,490
- To endorse someone.
- Okay.

493
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:01,492
Well, you worked under
two of the frontrunners.

494
00:25:01,561 --> 00:25:04,995
Battalion Chief Boden and
Deputy District Chief Grissom.

495
00:25:05,064 --> 00:25:06,463
So I want the straight skinny.

496
00:25:06,532 --> 00:25:08,198
If you were in my shoes,
who would you pick?

497
00:25:12,705 --> 00:25:14,505
Commissioner Staten, I'm not my father.

498
00:25:14,574 --> 00:25:18,475
I'm just a Lieutenant with
a spotty disciplinary record.

499
00:25:18,544 --> 00:25:22,613
I know who you are, Kelly.
That's why I'm asking.

500
00:25:22,682 --> 00:25:25,215
Pretend the choice is yours to make.

501
00:25:25,284 --> 00:25:28,252
Who's going to be the next commissioner?

502
00:25:35,883 --> 00:25:39,234
If you use the fabricator
Nick Porter recommended,

503
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:42,429
your per-unit cost
drops to 150 bucks a pop.

504
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,525
- What's your markup?
- 50 percent.

505
00:25:44,594 --> 00:25:46,403
Eh, 60 percent.

506
00:25:46,466 --> 00:25:48,231
Don't undervalue your genius, Cruz.

507
00:25:48,301 --> 00:25:52,208
60 percent puts you at 240 per unit

508
00:25:52,271 --> 00:25:55,839
times 73 units comes to...

509
00:25:55,908 --> 00:25:58,575
$17,520, American.

510
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,181
Cruz, that's great. Be excited.

511
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,293
No, I know, I just, uh...

512
00:26:07,513 --> 00:26:10,347
Glenn seemed a little sketchy.

513
00:26:10,689 --> 00:26:13,794
Let's just see
if he actually comes through.

514
00:26:13,848 --> 00:26:17,283
What was I supposed to say?
He's still fire commissioner.

515
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:19,269
I can't refuse
a direct question from him.

516
00:26:19,337 --> 00:26:22,105
There are diplomatic ways
to sidestep that sort of thing.

517
00:26:22,174 --> 00:26:24,474
"Sorry, Commissioner,
but that's above my pay grade."

518
00:26:24,543 --> 00:26:27,310
You know, I tried that. It didn't work.

519
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:29,479
Can you imagine Boden
threatening retaliation

520
00:26:29,548 --> 00:26:31,448
against someone
the way Grissom did to me?

521
00:26:31,516 --> 00:26:33,249
I mean, I have
a real soft spot for Grizz,

522
00:26:33,318 --> 00:26:35,952
but that's not the kind of person

523
00:26:36,021 --> 00:26:37,754
that we need as commissioner.
We need Boden.

524
00:26:37,823 --> 00:26:39,556
I think you did the right thing.

525
00:26:39,624 --> 00:26:42,459
- Come what may.
- Yeah, let the chips fall.

526
00:26:42,527 --> 00:26:44,327
Yeah, that's easy for you two to say.

527
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:47,097
You're not the ones with the
target painted on your back.

528
00:26:47,165 --> 00:26:49,966
Deep down, Grissom is a politician.

529
00:26:50,035 --> 00:26:52,736
And politicians go
whichever way the wind blows.

530
00:26:52,804 --> 00:26:53,970
Boden makes commissioner,

531
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:55,638
Grisson will fall right in line.

532
00:26:57,008 --> 00:26:58,274
If you say so.

533
00:26:58,343 --> 00:27:01,444
I trust the former Alderman.

534
00:27:07,486 --> 00:27:09,018
Are you all right?

535
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:12,741
Yeah, I'm okay,
I'm just going through a lot.

536
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:15,925
Lieutenant.

537
00:27:15,994 --> 00:27:18,155
You'd better get out on the floor.

538
00:27:19,674 --> 00:27:21,894
You would be, um... you would be a deer.

539
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:22,854
You'd be a deer?

540
00:27:22,901 --> 00:27:25,535
- What about me?
- No, it's a no.

541
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:28,004
- Hey, Nick.
- Kelly!

542
00:27:28,073 --> 00:27:30,140
Sup, bud?

543
00:27:30,208 --> 00:27:32,275
- I made it.
- For me?

544
00:27:32,344 --> 00:27:34,310
Because you fixed my bed.

545
00:27:35,947 --> 00:27:37,480
That's pretty nice.

546
00:27:37,549 --> 00:27:39,783
You think I'll be able
to fit in there to drive it?

547
00:27:39,851 --> 00:27:40,984
Maybe if you eat less.

548
00:27:42,187 --> 00:27:44,521
- Hey, Stella.
- Hey.

549
00:27:44,589 --> 00:27:46,289
Nicky spent all morning on that.

550
00:27:46,358 --> 00:27:48,691
He was so determined to get it done.

551
00:27:50,562 --> 00:27:53,056
- He's a sweet kid.
- Oh, thank you.

552
00:27:53,163 --> 00:27:54,896
Mm-hmm.

553
00:27:55,066 --> 00:27:57,567
And I have got to give it to you

554
00:27:57,636 --> 00:27:59,636
for pulling out all the stops.

555
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:03,339
I'm not sure I know what you mean.

556
00:28:03,408 --> 00:28:05,909
Oh, come on, the job that
suddenly brings you close?

557
00:28:05,977 --> 00:28:08,812
A cute kid.

558
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,324
Look, whatever you're up to,

559
00:28:11,855 --> 00:28:14,152
I'm just going to warn you now.

560
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,086
Do not mess with Kelly.

561
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,027
Excuse me?

562
00:28:24,095 --> 00:28:26,062
You heard me.

563
00:28:30,802 --> 00:28:34,504
Okay, Nicky, come on, baby,
it's time to go, okay?

564
00:28:34,573 --> 00:28:36,039
Let's let Kelly get back to work.

565
00:28:36,107 --> 00:28:37,740
High five, all right, grab your bag.

566
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:39,042
- Grab your bag, baby.
- Bye.

567
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,244
Bye, bye.

568
00:28:41,313 --> 00:28:44,080
See you soon, bud.
Thank you for the truck.

569
00:28:44,149 --> 00:28:46,049
You're welcome!

570
00:28:48,887 --> 00:28:51,521
You guys got to try this sauce.

571
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,089
It's Trudy's recipe.

572
00:28:53,158 --> 00:28:56,426
See if you can figure out
the secret ingredient.

573
00:28:56,494 --> 00:28:58,895
- Hey, question for you.
- Shoot.

574
00:28:58,964 --> 00:29:01,231
Uh, Brett got the contact info

575
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:02,899
for a great fertility doc.

576
00:29:02,968 --> 00:29:04,100
I was wondering what you thought

577
00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:06,269
about me making an appointment?

578
00:29:06,338 --> 00:29:08,738
- A fertility doctor?
- Mm-hmm.

579
00:29:08,807 --> 00:29:12,041
Doesn't it seem a little soon for that?

580
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,276
Well, I just thought it would be smart

581
00:29:13,345 --> 00:29:14,544
to just get a check up, make sure

582
00:29:14,613 --> 00:29:15,945
everything looks good.

583
00:29:16,014 --> 00:29:17,780
Maybe, you know,
find out if there's anything

584
00:29:17,849 --> 00:29:19,782
we can do to speed up the process.

585
00:29:19,851 --> 00:29:21,584
I mean, it makes sense.

586
00:29:21,653 --> 00:29:23,152
But...

587
00:29:23,221 --> 00:29:25,788
It's been great, spending
all this time together.

588
00:29:25,857 --> 00:29:27,073
Hasn't it?

589
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,262
To be honest, it feels like
there's no need to rush.

590
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,297
No, yeah, it's... it's been great.

591
00:29:38,303 --> 00:29:41,084
I guess a checkup wouldn't hurt, though.

592
00:29:42,073 --> 00:29:44,207
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

593
00:29:46,478 --> 00:29:49,812
What was that business
out there with Renee?

594
00:29:49,881 --> 00:29:53,449
Uh, what business?

595
00:29:53,518 --> 00:29:56,586
Don't even. I saw you.

596
00:29:56,655 --> 00:29:59,923
Renee and Kelly may be
working on a case together.

597
00:29:59,991 --> 00:30:01,991
That's fine. But now, she knows

598
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,661
not to angle
for anything more than that.

599
00:30:08,533 --> 00:30:10,133
I might have gone a little psycho,

600
00:30:10,201 --> 00:30:11,701
but a girl's got to get
proactive sometimes.

601
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,769
- Uh-huh.
- All right?

602
00:30:12,837 --> 00:30:14,137
Yeah.

603
00:30:14,205 --> 00:30:15,838
Did you guess the secret ingredient?

604
00:30:15,907 --> 00:30:17,707
- Oh.
- Oh.

605
00:30:17,776 --> 00:30:19,008
No.

606
00:30:19,077 --> 00:30:20,310
Strawberries.

607
00:30:20,378 --> 00:30:22,345
Great, now I don't get to guess.

608
00:30:22,414 --> 00:30:25,281
Deputy Commissioner, what brings you by?

609
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,383
I have some news for 51.

610
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:29,686
Commissioner Staten
asked me to tell you that

611
00:30:29,754 --> 00:30:32,515
he's officially endorsing
Battalion Chief Wallace Boden

612
00:30:32,586 --> 00:30:33,823
to take his place.

613
00:30:33,892 --> 00:30:36,570
Yeah, Chief!

614
00:30:36,648 --> 00:30:38,728
Chief, yes!

615
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:41,297
Now, now, now, it's no
guarantee of the appointment,

616
00:30:41,366 --> 00:30:43,466
but you can bet it'll carry
a lot of weight with the mayor.

617
00:30:43,535 --> 00:30:46,035
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

618
00:30:46,104 --> 00:30:47,737
Well deserved.

619
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:50,139
- That's good news.
- As long as it doesn't

620
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:51,240
light a fire under Grissom.

621
00:30:53,244 --> 00:30:55,878
Triple X root beer? No way.

622
00:30:55,947 --> 00:30:57,513
I thought you'd appreciate that.

623
00:30:57,582 --> 00:30:59,415
I had a buddy of mine
overnight it from Indianapolis.

624
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:01,551
- Aw.
- You know, we have

625
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:04,253
- grocery stores here in Chicago.
- No, no, Cruz.

626
00:31:04,322 --> 00:31:06,990
Triple X is an Indiana staple.
You wouldn't understand.

627
00:31:07,058 --> 00:31:08,558
Guess not.

628
00:31:08,626 --> 00:31:11,327
- Thank you, this is so sweet.
- My pleasure.

629
00:31:11,396 --> 00:31:13,396
So, Joe, you have a proposal for me?

630
00:31:13,465 --> 00:31:16,265
Um, we crunched some numbers,

631
00:31:16,334 --> 00:31:22,205
and the best that I can do
for you is 275 per unit.

632
00:31:22,273 --> 00:31:24,607
- Wait, seriously?
- Yeah, seriously.

633
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:26,671
That just seems a little high.

634
00:31:26,741 --> 00:31:27,877
I mean, final analysis,

635
00:31:27,946 --> 00:31:30,413
it's just a Halligan
bolted to a sledgehammer.

636
00:31:30,482 --> 00:31:32,515
It's the idea that counts.
No one ever thought

637
00:31:32,584 --> 00:31:34,350
to bolt these two things
together before.

638
00:31:34,419 --> 00:31:37,720
- Cruz.
- No wiggle room there?

639
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:40,223
Afraid not, it's a quality product.

640
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:42,558
We don't cut corners.

641
00:31:42,627 --> 00:31:45,428
Well, okay.

642
00:31:45,497 --> 00:31:48,131
The root beer is yours to keep.
Of course, my gift to you.

643
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:50,266
Listen, guys,
good luck with the Slamigan.

644
00:31:50,335 --> 00:31:52,468
Seriously, it's a killer name.

645
00:31:52,537 --> 00:31:54,370
But I'll never get a number
like that approved.

646
00:32:03,515 --> 00:32:04,647
What's wrong with you?

647
00:32:04,716 --> 00:32:07,116
The number we arrived at was 240.

648
00:32:07,185 --> 00:32:09,552
- It's worth more than that.
- Well, apparently not.

649
00:32:09,621 --> 00:32:11,921
You just thumbed your nose at $17,000.

650
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,790
Why would you do that?

651
00:32:16,694 --> 00:32:20,296
<i>Squad 3, Battalion 25.
Person trapped, Navy Pier.</i>

652
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:40,817
- What's the situation?
- A brawl broke out,

653
00:32:40,885 --> 00:32:44,487
and somebody got stuffed down
the cowl vent.

654
00:32:44,556 --> 00:32:47,090
- Stuffed down the what?
- I'll show you, come on.

655
00:32:49,327 --> 00:32:51,961
Excuse me, guys. Coming through.

656
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,463
Coming through.

657
00:32:53,531 --> 00:32:55,832
We weren't on the lake a half an hour

658
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,302
and all drunken hell broke loose.

659
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:02,438
Yeah, I had to turn them right around.

660
00:33:02,507 --> 00:33:04,607
Here he is. Back up, everybody.

661
00:33:04,676 --> 00:33:06,843
Back up a little bit.
Give these guys some room.

662
00:33:06,911 --> 00:33:08,678
Hey, you gotta help me! I'm slipping!

663
00:33:08,746 --> 00:33:11,314
- Hey, where does this pipe lead?
- It's the air intake.

664
00:33:11,382 --> 00:33:12,739
It leads straight down to the engines.

665
00:33:12,809 --> 00:33:14,817
Don't let me go! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

666
00:33:14,886 --> 00:33:17,220
Severide, he's slipping!
Hey, move out of the way.

667
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:19,730
Hey, back up, back up.

668
00:33:19,808 --> 00:33:22,325
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, stop moving.

669
00:33:22,393 --> 00:33:25,187
- Hey!
- Don't let me go!

670
00:33:31,737 --> 00:33:33,288
We have to cut him out.

671
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,718
Hey, Cruz.

672
00:33:36,788 --> 00:33:38,406
<i>Grab the wizzer saw.</i>

673
00:33:38,476 --> 00:33:41,177
Capp, Tony, rope bag and Halligans.

674
00:33:41,238 --> 00:33:43,172
Wizzer saw, copy that.

675
00:33:48,646 --> 00:33:52,449
- Where's the action?
- On the boat, Chief.

676
00:33:53,651 --> 00:33:55,583
Excuse me.

677
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,187
Just hold on. We got you.

678
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,027
- Chief, you got him?
- Go!

679
00:34:07,598 --> 00:34:09,431
What happened?

680
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,734
Victim got stuck in the pipe.
He's upside down.

681
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:14,903
I heard this call was on a booze cruise,

682
00:34:14,972 --> 00:34:16,772
and I knew it'd be one for the ages.

683
00:34:19,777 --> 00:34:22,111
Good to go.

684
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:23,545
Whoa, whoa, Severide,
what are you doing?

685
00:34:23,614 --> 00:34:25,114
He's jammed in there pretty tight.

686
00:34:25,182 --> 00:34:27,449
- You could cut him.
- It's heavy gauge steel.

687
00:34:27,518 --> 00:34:30,919
I'm just going to score it,
snap the cowl off.

688
00:34:30,988 --> 00:34:32,154
You all right with this, Chief?

689
00:34:32,223 --> 00:34:33,455
He knows what he's doing.

690
00:34:33,524 --> 00:34:36,792
I hope so!

691
00:34:43,567 --> 00:34:45,400
Hold on!

692
00:34:50,641 --> 00:34:53,475
Come on, guys.

693
00:34:53,544 --> 00:34:55,477
All right, Cruz, put your back into it.

694
00:34:55,546 --> 00:34:56,578
Yeah, you bet.

695
00:34:57,982 --> 00:34:59,948
Come on, yep.

696
00:35:04,622 --> 00:35:06,555
Come on, up higher.

697
00:35:14,999 --> 00:35:17,566
Hey, you okay?

698
00:35:18,669 --> 00:35:21,870
- You good?
- Oh, man, I need a drink.

699
00:35:24,775 --> 00:35:26,308
All right, you're okay.

700
00:35:31,615 --> 00:35:33,282
Hey, Chief.

701
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,717
Good for you on Staten's endorsement.

702
00:35:35,786 --> 00:35:37,986
That ought to seal it for you, huh?

703
00:35:38,046 --> 00:35:40,189
Oh, I think we're a long way
from the finish line,

704
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,324
but thank you.

705
00:35:46,397 --> 00:35:48,197
Looks like you backed the right horse.

706
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:55,470
He took that well.

707
00:35:57,041 --> 00:35:59,223
Casey predicted he would.

708
00:36:00,644 --> 00:36:02,678
Politics, man.

709
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:10,409
Hey.

710
00:36:10,955 --> 00:36:13,221
I heard you blew the Slamigan sale.

711
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:15,490
It's a great piece of equipment,

712
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:17,759
and we were undervaluing it.

713
00:36:17,828 --> 00:36:20,153
Besides, that Glenn guy isn't interested

714
00:36:20,201 --> 00:36:22,368
in the Slamigan, anyway.
He's interested in Brett.

715
00:36:23,771 --> 00:36:26,339
Now it makes sense.

716
00:36:28,243 --> 00:36:30,510
- It's my fault.
- What?

717
00:36:30,578 --> 00:36:32,402
I'm the one that told you
to keep your feelings

718
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,589
about Brett to yourself.

719
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,915
Don't upset the roommate apple
cart, et cetera, et cetera.

720
00:36:35,984 --> 00:36:37,250
- So?
- So, obviously,

721
00:36:37,318 --> 00:36:39,318
it was bad advice.

722
00:36:39,387 --> 00:36:42,321
Since I said it,
you haven't been able to sleep.

723
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:44,690
You had sex with a married woman.

724
00:36:44,759 --> 00:36:46,159
You got punched in the face,

725
00:36:46,227 --> 00:36:50,763
and now, you blew a huge Slamigan sale.

726
00:36:50,832 --> 00:36:52,031
You need to tell her.

727
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,499
What? No, no way.

728
00:36:53,568 --> 00:36:56,302
Hey, hey, hey. It's driving you crazy.

729
00:36:56,371 --> 00:36:59,505
This isn't who you are.
You're Joe Cruz, man.

730
00:36:59,574 --> 00:37:02,074
You wear your heart on your sleeve.

731
00:37:03,678 --> 00:37:05,278
There's no point, Otis.

732
00:37:05,346 --> 00:37:06,979
She doesn't see me
the way that I see her.

733
00:37:07,048 --> 00:37:08,181
- You don't know that.
- I do.

734
00:37:08,249 --> 00:37:09,515
If I hadn't ruined everything,

735
00:37:09,584 --> 00:37:11,450
she'd be out with Glenn right now.

736
00:37:15,456 --> 00:37:17,523
- What, what's going on?
- I have Joe right here.

737
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:18,949
Hang on one second.

738
00:37:19,027 --> 00:37:20,226
I got Glenn to come back to the table.

739
00:37:20,295 --> 00:37:21,794
He's willing to pay 260 per unit.

740
00:37:21,863 --> 00:37:23,663
Can I say yes?

741
00:37:23,731 --> 00:37:25,498
How did you get him to reconsider?

742
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:27,333
I mean, it wasn't easy,
especially after I told him

743
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:30,281
I wasn't interested
in having dinner with him.

744
00:37:31,472 --> 00:37:34,307
- Can I say yes?
- Uh, yes, yes.

745
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:36,309
Okay. Glenn, you've got a deal.

746
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:40,359
Uh-huh. Okay.

747
00:37:43,318 --> 00:37:45,288
You're right.

748
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,154
I got to tell her how I feel.

749
00:37:48,223 --> 00:37:50,823
- Great.
- But not right away.

750
00:37:50,892 --> 00:37:56,028
This is a long time coming.
Calls for a grand gesture.

751
00:37:56,097 --> 00:37:57,363
If she's impressed with root beer,

752
00:37:57,432 --> 00:37:58,564
she's going to die when she sees

753
00:37:58,633 --> 00:38:00,633
what I'm going to cook up for her.

754
00:38:04,305 --> 00:38:06,672
Well, they're super thorough,
so that's good.

755
00:38:06,741 --> 00:38:08,774
Doctor Letts seems like
she knows what she's doing.

756
00:38:08,843 --> 00:38:11,077
Mm-hmm.

757
00:38:11,145 --> 00:38:13,713
Lots of twins up here.

758
00:38:13,781 --> 00:38:15,448
Wow, some triplets, too.

759
00:38:16,785 --> 00:38:19,957
- Could you imagine?
- Eh, we'd figure it out.

760
00:38:20,855 --> 00:38:22,922
I'm glad we came.

761
00:38:24,525 --> 00:38:26,459
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Oh, no worries.

762
00:38:26,527 --> 00:38:28,227
We were just stockpiling questions,

763
00:38:28,296 --> 00:38:30,429
like hormone shots, that kind of thing.

764
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,390
I'm happy to answer
any questions you have,

765
00:38:32,452 --> 00:38:35,401
but first, let's talk
about your test results.

766
00:38:37,372 --> 00:38:39,272
Everything okay?

767
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:43,637
When we did the ultrasound,
we noticed this.

768
00:38:44,479 --> 00:38:48,214
It's an aneurysm
on the right iliac artery,

769
00:38:48,283 --> 00:38:50,049
most likely from the abdominal pregnancy

770
00:38:50,118 --> 00:38:52,485
you suffered several years ago.

771
00:38:52,553 --> 00:38:57,256
Um, so what does that mean
for getting pregnant?

772
00:38:57,325 --> 00:38:59,558
It's not about whether
you can get pregnant.

773
00:38:59,627 --> 00:39:01,661
It's about whether you should.

774
00:39:01,729 --> 00:39:05,631
Pregnancy places a lot of added
stress on the vascular system,

775
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,401
and creates the risk
of the aneurysm rupturing.

776
00:39:08,469 --> 00:39:11,304
And if it does?

777
00:39:11,372 --> 00:39:14,774
It could be fatal for the mother.

778
00:39:17,412 --> 00:39:21,747
I'm sorry. I wish I had better news.

779
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:37,096
Don't repeat this to anybody.
These are on the house.

780
00:39:37,165 --> 00:39:39,332
All right, a celebration is in order.

781
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,800
And I know, if you make commissioner,

782
00:39:40,868 --> 00:39:42,201
that you are going to do

783
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,337
your swearing-in party here at Molly's.

784
00:39:44,405 --> 00:39:46,339
- Uh...
- Or on your new boat.

785
00:39:46,407 --> 00:39:47,807
I've had enough of boat parties.

786
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:49,642
- Oh...
- Stop.

787
00:39:49,711 --> 00:39:52,511
- Excuse me, Chief Boden?
- Yes?

788
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,180
Hi, I'm Zach Logan with the "Sun Times."

789
00:39:54,248 --> 00:39:55,815
Uh, sorry to ambush you like this.

790
00:39:55,883 --> 00:39:58,317
I was just hoping I could
get a quick statement.

791
00:40:00,288 --> 00:40:02,336
I'll be right back.

792
00:40:03,257 --> 00:40:04,724
What can I do you for?

793
00:40:04,792 --> 00:40:06,525
Uh, first, congratulations
on the endorsement.

794
00:40:06,594 --> 00:40:08,160
- Thank you.
- And uh,

795
00:40:08,229 --> 00:40:10,796
then what I wanted to know is
any truth to the claims

796
00:40:10,865 --> 00:40:13,566
that you recently received
a large cash kickback

797
00:40:13,634 --> 00:40:15,901
from a wealthy friend
of Commissioner Staten's?

798
00:40:18,606 --> 00:40:20,339
I'm not going to tell you.

799
00:40:20,408 --> 00:40:23,809
The whole point is that
you have to guess the color.

800
00:40:23,878 --> 00:40:25,478
What do I win if I guess right?

801
00:40:25,546 --> 00:40:27,380
You get to take it off.

802
00:40:29,283 --> 00:40:31,350
- I like this game.
- Mm-hmm.

803
00:40:31,419 --> 00:40:34,387
- Okay, I'll start simple.
- Mm-hmm.

804
00:40:34,455 --> 00:40:36,756
- How about black?
- Um...

805
00:40:39,127 --> 00:40:41,260
I'm so sorry. Uh, Kelly.

806
00:40:41,329 --> 00:40:44,073
- Nicholas is missing.
- Huh?

807
00:40:44,128 --> 00:40:46,232
The sitter went and
picked him up from daycare,

808
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,067
but then she never brought him home,

809
00:40:48,136 --> 00:40:50,703
and I keep calling, but it just
goes straight to voicemail.

810
00:40:50,772 --> 00:40:52,671
And I don't know what to do.
I don't know if I should

811
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,840
- call the police, or if I...
- Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

812
00:40:54,909 --> 00:40:57,910
Just take it easy, okay?
I'm sure that he's fine.

813
00:40:57,979 --> 00:40:59,278
- Okay.
- Okay, I'll take you

814
00:40:59,347 --> 00:41:00,746
over to the 21st district.

815
00:41:00,815 --> 00:41:03,582
I'm sure they'll be able
to track her cellphone.

816
00:41:03,651 --> 00:41:04,784
Okay?

817
00:41:04,852 --> 00:41:06,585
Okay, yeah, that sounds good.

818
00:41:08,256 --> 00:41:10,589
Yeah, go, yeah, just let me know

819
00:41:10,658 --> 00:41:13,058
- when you find out anything.
- All right.

820
00:41:19,834 --> 00:41:22,401
We cannot issue an Amber
Alert unless we have reason

821
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,270
to believe that the child
is in imminent danger

822
00:41:24,338 --> 00:41:25,938
of serious bodily injury or death.

823
00:41:26,007 --> 00:41:27,907
- From what you've described...
- How the hell

824
00:41:27,975 --> 00:41:31,811
am I supposed to know that if
I can't get a hold of my son?

825
00:41:31,879 --> 00:41:33,979
Hey, anything that
you can do to help us out,

826
00:41:34,048 --> 00:41:36,359
it'll be greatly appreciated, Joe.

827
00:41:37,654 --> 00:41:39,453
Becky?

828
00:41:40,002 --> 00:41:43,148
Where... where are you?

829
00:41:43,891 --> 00:41:47,460
Okay, I'm gonna come to you. Good.

830
00:41:50,031 --> 00:41:52,331
That was my babysitter.

831
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,467
They went ice skating,

832
00:41:54,535 --> 00:41:57,970
and then she took Nicholas
back to her house.

833
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:01,307
She was charging her phone
and they both fell asleep.

834
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:04,610
I'm so embarrassed.

835
00:42:07,248 --> 00:42:09,742
- Hey, thanks, Joe.
- Yeah.

836
00:42:14,828 --> 00:42:18,363
- I'm so sorry.
- That's perfectly understandable.

837
00:42:20,895 --> 00:42:22,561
Let's go get him.

838
00:42:29,837 --> 00:42:32,004
It turns out the
babysitter's mom was making

839
00:42:32,073 --> 00:42:35,140
spaghetti or something.
They went to her house

840
00:42:35,209 --> 00:42:37,543
and fell asleep watching TV.

841
00:42:37,612 --> 00:42:39,845
What?

842
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,568
Well, it was just seems
like Renee overreacted.

843
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,353
What was she supposed to do?

844
00:42:47,421 --> 00:42:50,155
She goes home, there's no note,
there's no nothing.

845
00:42:50,224 --> 00:42:51,857
She tries to get in touch
with the babysitter.

846
00:42:51,926 --> 00:42:54,126
It goes straight to voicemail.

847
00:42:54,195 --> 00:42:55,861
Anyone would freak out.

848
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:58,819
Uh, sure.

849
00:43:10,378 --> 00:43:12,713
Hey.

850
00:43:14,782 --> 00:43:16,549
Uh, so,

851
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,296
I've been thinking about it a lot since

852
00:43:18,371 --> 00:43:19,585
we left the fertility clinic.

853
00:43:19,654 --> 00:43:23,973
And I don't wanna
be rash or impulsive but...

854
00:43:24,492 --> 00:43:27,706
I've decided that we're
gonna keep trying for a baby.

855
00:43:28,963 --> 00:43:30,341
You've decided?

856
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:33,899
Well, it's my body, so it's my choice.

857
00:43:33,968 --> 00:43:35,501
I'm the one taking on the risk.

858
00:43:35,788 --> 00:43:37,454
And I get it. I get it.

859
00:43:37,536 --> 00:43:39,705
I know what you're gonna say,
especially since they said that

860
00:43:39,774 --> 00:43:41,540
there was a 10% risk that
something could go wrong,

861
00:43:41,609 --> 00:43:44,076
but the way I see it,

862
00:43:44,145 --> 00:43:46,579
there means there's
a 90% chance that we could

863
00:43:46,647 --> 00:43:49,582
be happy parents to our child.

864
00:43:53,045 --> 00:43:57,080
And haven't we had some fun trying?

865
00:43:57,158 --> 00:43:58,985
Look,

866
00:43:59,961 --> 00:44:03,862
I know you've been wanting to
be a dad since I first met you.

867
00:44:05,266 --> 00:44:06,894
This is our time.

868
00:44:11,238 --> 00:44:14,607
No, ma'am, all I can
offer you is, "No comment."

869
00:44:14,675 --> 00:44:16,108
You will have to take that up with

870
00:44:16,177 --> 00:44:18,611
Chief Huffhines in the
public relations department.

871
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:20,297
Thank you.

872
00:44:21,015 --> 00:44:22,815
I haven't seen anything online yet.

873
00:44:22,883 --> 00:44:24,883
Well, maybe there's hope
for fact-checking in the world.

874
00:44:24,952 --> 00:44:27,086
Any idea how this
bribery story got started?

875
00:44:27,154 --> 00:44:29,722
There's no mystery there.
It had to be Grizz.

876
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:31,348
He's the only other person
who knew about it.

877
00:44:31,426 --> 00:44:33,292
He also knows it's a bunch of lies.

878
00:44:33,361 --> 00:44:35,127
I'm gonna handle the story
the same way we handled

879
00:44:35,196 --> 00:44:38,297
the incident itself...
above board and by the book.

880
00:44:40,701 --> 00:44:42,791
<i>Squad 3, Engine 51.</i>

881
00:44:42,853 --> 00:44:43,971
<i>Construction fire.</i>

882
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:46,158
<i>- 81 South Aberdeen St.</i>
- Let's go.

883
00:45:07,609 --> 00:45:09,309
What happened?

884
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:11,196
Our crew must've broken a gas main.

885
00:45:11,265 --> 00:45:13,165
The lumber...
it just went up like kindling.

886
00:45:15,336 --> 00:45:18,337
We'll fight the fire
from the second floor.

887
00:45:18,406 --> 00:45:19,805
Go.

888
00:45:19,874 --> 00:45:22,608
Battalion 25 to Main,
we have a ruptured gas main.

889
00:45:22,677 --> 00:45:25,978
We need the gas company here
ASAP to shut this thing down.

890
00:45:26,047 --> 00:45:29,048
51, drop two lines...
one to cover the team inside,

891
00:45:29,116 --> 00:45:31,216
one to be in position
to extinguish the fire

892
00:45:31,285 --> 00:45:32,851
once this gas is shut off.

893
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,202
- Let's go!
<i>- Copy that, Battalion 25.</i>

894
00:45:37,558 --> 00:45:40,659
- Hey, help!
- Get us out of here!

895
00:45:40,728 --> 00:45:42,194
Help!

896
00:45:42,263 --> 00:45:43,529
Hey!

897
00:45:43,597 --> 00:45:45,731
Here.

898
00:45:48,969 --> 00:45:51,670
51, send your line straight down.

899
00:45:51,739 --> 00:45:54,389
We got two men trapped.

900
00:45:54,504 --> 00:45:57,116
Bend the line into a U and send it down.

901
00:45:57,666 --> 00:46:00,725
We'll pull these guys out
using the hose.

902
00:46:07,388 --> 00:46:09,555
- Ready, Chief.
- Go.

903
00:46:14,161 --> 00:46:16,895
Hey, the water curtain
will keep the heat back.

904
00:46:16,964 --> 00:46:20,099
Get behind me.

905
00:46:20,167 --> 00:46:23,014
Coming down to you, Lieutenant.

906
00:46:27,775 --> 00:46:29,108
One at a time.

907
00:46:29,176 --> 00:46:30,576
Step on the hose, wrap your arms up.

908
00:46:30,644 --> 00:46:33,112
- They'll bring you up.
- Got it.

909
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,080
And... pull!

910
00:46:36,617 --> 00:46:39,852
Pull! Pull!

911
00:46:42,423 --> 00:46:44,022
Come on.

912
00:46:44,091 --> 00:46:47,326
- You okay?
- Yeah.

913
00:46:50,197 --> 00:46:51,597
And pull!

914
00:46:53,634 --> 00:46:57,536
Pull! We got you.

915
00:46:57,605 --> 00:46:59,954
Coming to you, Lieutenant.

916
00:47:01,776 --> 00:47:04,618
Severide, get out of there!

917
00:47:06,714 --> 00:47:10,176
Pull! Pull!

918
00:47:10,485 --> 00:47:14,301
Pull!

919
00:47:16,624 --> 00:47:18,223
- You good?
- Yeah.

920
00:47:20,728 --> 00:47:22,628
Quick thinking, Chief.

921
00:47:22,696 --> 00:47:25,564
<i>Gas company is on the scene.</i>

922
00:47:30,304 --> 00:47:34,072
Yes, thank you. Two nights.

923
00:47:34,141 --> 00:47:35,641
Oh, hey, do you guys have a shuttle

924
00:47:35,709 --> 00:47:38,811
from the airport to Blackberry Farms?

925
00:47:38,879 --> 00:47:43,582
Oh, oh, great. Thank you so much.

926
00:47:43,651 --> 00:47:46,118
Blackberry Farms?

927
00:47:46,187 --> 00:47:48,821
I saw that place on the Travel Channel.

928
00:47:48,889 --> 00:47:50,656
That is swanky.

929
00:47:50,724 --> 00:47:52,191
The Slamigan is blowing up.

930
00:47:52,259 --> 00:47:54,092
We already have eight new
orders across the Midwest,

931
00:47:54,161 --> 00:47:55,794
and it looks like we're gonna hit

932
00:47:55,863 --> 00:47:57,830
six figure revenue by third quarter.

933
00:47:57,898 --> 00:47:59,998
That's great!

934
00:48:00,067 --> 00:48:02,868
- I figure I'd celebrate.
- By booking two nights

935
00:48:02,937 --> 00:48:05,604
at one of the most
romantic spots in America?

936
00:48:05,673 --> 00:48:07,706
You taking Otis?

937
00:48:07,775 --> 00:48:10,195
Hmm?

938
00:48:15,616 --> 00:48:20,052
Uh, I'm gonna tell Brett the
great news about our company

939
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,621
and then I'm gonna
ask her to go with me.

940
00:48:23,891 --> 00:48:25,991
- Whoa.
- I just...

941
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:29,728
just figured I'll put it all
out there, you know?

942
00:48:29,797 --> 00:48:32,197
Tell her how I really feel.

943
00:48:32,266 --> 00:48:34,700
Grand gesture.

944
00:48:34,768 --> 00:48:37,569
And if I get rejected, well,

945
00:48:37,638 --> 00:48:39,571
at least I didn't hold back.

946
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,206
Is that crazy?

947
00:48:41,275 --> 00:48:43,175
It is, it's crazy. I'm a moron.

948
00:48:43,244 --> 00:48:44,566
It's not too late for me to back out.

949
00:48:44,644 --> 00:48:46,044
I should back out. Should I back out?

950
00:48:46,113 --> 00:48:48,547
No, you should not back out.

951
00:48:48,616 --> 00:48:50,082
You sure?

952
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:53,394
Look, you can never
go wrong with a grand gesture.

953
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,692
Thank you.

954
00:49:10,738 --> 00:49:12,070
Hey!

955
00:49:12,139 --> 00:49:13,969
I got lunch duties today.

956
00:49:14,024 --> 00:49:15,407
Oh, yeah? What's on the menu?

957
00:49:15,476 --> 00:49:17,776
Well, that is what I was
coming out here to talk

958
00:49:17,845 --> 00:49:20,545
to you about... see,
there are certain privileges

959
00:49:20,614 --> 00:49:21,880
to going out with the cook,

960
00:49:21,949 --> 00:49:24,871
like you get a say
in what she serves up.

961
00:49:25,953 --> 00:49:27,386
Please say chicken parm.

962
00:49:27,454 --> 00:49:29,121
Please say chicken parm.

963
00:49:29,189 --> 00:49:31,957
- Chicken parm?
- Ah, that's my specialty!

964
00:49:32,026 --> 00:49:33,558
Excuse me?

965
00:49:33,627 --> 00:49:34,893
Can I steal him for a second?

966
00:49:34,962 --> 00:49:36,566
- Hi.
- Hey.

967
00:49:36,651 --> 00:49:38,530
Sorry to barge in on you like this,

968
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:41,099
- but we have a problem.
- Okay, what's up?

969
00:49:41,168 --> 00:49:42,801
Well, the Crowder Refinery
has brought on

970
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:45,037
Rick Rubio as co-counsel.

971
00:49:45,105 --> 00:49:47,239
He's a tough, tough defense attorney

972
00:49:47,308 --> 00:49:50,275
with a forte for
discrediting expert witnesses.

973
00:49:50,344 --> 00:49:52,244
Okay, so how do we beat this guy?

974
00:49:52,313 --> 00:49:54,046
I had some of the young litigators

975
00:49:54,114 --> 00:49:56,448
mock up some questions that
you might draw on cross.

976
00:49:56,517 --> 00:49:58,116
I would love to go over these with you

977
00:49:58,185 --> 00:49:59,952
if there's a conference room
that we can borrow.

978
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:02,120
- Um, yeah, of course.
- Okay.

979
00:50:02,189 --> 00:50:04,402
- Yeah, I got it.
- Oh, thank you.

980
00:50:05,492 --> 00:50:07,626
Uh, and hey, chicken parm sounds great.

981
00:50:07,695 --> 00:50:09,968
I will get right on it...

982
00:50:14,468 --> 00:50:16,501
Ah, Boden.

983
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:19,071
I think we may have gotten out
in front of this bribery story.

984
00:50:19,139 --> 00:50:20,505
The commissioner has responded

985
00:50:20,574 --> 00:50:22,774
to the Tribune's questions
through my office.

986
00:50:22,843 --> 00:50:24,142
- What did he say?
- Well,

987
00:50:24,211 --> 00:50:27,312
he acknowledged that
a certain battalion chief

988
00:50:27,381 --> 00:50:29,448
did receive an improper cash gift,

989
00:50:29,516 --> 00:50:31,817
but as soon as the commissioner
learned about it,

990
00:50:31,885 --> 00:50:33,285
he insisted it be returned.

991
00:50:33,354 --> 00:50:35,988
He's not naming any names, but...

992
00:50:36,056 --> 00:50:38,708
- But that's a lie.
- It's an interpretation.

993
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:40,258
Did he mention it was his buddy

994
00:50:40,327 --> 00:50:41,593
who made the illicit payment?

995
00:50:41,662 --> 00:50:43,261
No one's getting
in trouble here, Wallace.

996
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:45,664
Commissioner Staton wants
to preserve his reputation

997
00:50:45,733 --> 00:50:46,999
as he heads over to FEMA.

998
00:50:47,067 --> 00:50:48,667
By throwing our chief under the bus.

999
00:50:48,736 --> 00:50:51,036
By putting this to bed.

1000
00:50:51,105 --> 00:50:54,021
- I'm done falling.
- Hey, Wallace.

1001
00:50:58,846 --> 00:51:00,178
Chief Hatcher?

1002
00:51:00,247 --> 00:51:02,647
Oh, just who I was looking for.

1003
00:51:02,716 --> 00:51:03,982
What can I do for you?

1004
00:51:04,051 --> 00:51:05,517
I know we've had our past differences,

1005
00:51:05,586 --> 00:51:07,519
but I've always thought of you
as one of the fiercest,

1006
00:51:07,588 --> 00:51:10,194
most battle-tested
paramedics in the CFD.

1007
00:51:10,724 --> 00:51:13,225
- Thank you, Chief.
- So I'll get right to it.

1008
00:51:13,293 --> 00:51:15,360
Puerto Rico is still in a bad way.

1009
00:51:15,429 --> 00:51:18,196
There's a lot of people in
need of power and assistance,

1010
00:51:18,265 --> 00:51:20,198
so we're sending a team of
paramedics down there to help

1011
00:51:20,267 --> 00:51:23,137
with the relief efforts,
and I need some volunteers.

1012
00:51:24,038 --> 00:51:25,370
Oh.

1013
00:51:25,439 --> 00:51:27,731
You were the first person
who came to mind.

1014
00:51:29,076 --> 00:51:31,076
I-I'm flattered.

1015
00:51:31,145 --> 00:51:33,412
It's just, it's not a good time.

1016
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,866
It never is,
but this is an important cause.

1017
00:51:37,818 --> 00:51:40,280
I appreciate all this, Chief, I do.

1018
00:51:40,888 --> 00:51:43,102
I just got a lot going on right now.

1019
00:51:44,458 --> 00:51:46,058
Hey, no problem.

1020
00:51:46,126 --> 00:51:47,977
I understand.

1021
00:52:00,574 --> 00:52:03,052
Thought you were more of a man, Carl.

1022
00:52:03,944 --> 00:52:05,377
- Excuse me?
- I thought you were more

1023
00:52:05,446 --> 00:52:07,709
of a firefighter than
a cheap mudslinger.

1024
00:52:09,116 --> 00:52:10,515
You better rethink everything

1025
00:52:10,584 --> 00:52:12,451
coming out of your mouth
right now, Chief.

1026
00:52:12,519 --> 00:52:13,847
I know it was you.

1027
00:52:13,902 --> 00:52:16,088
I know you leaked to
whatever reporter you have

1028
00:52:16,156 --> 00:52:18,890
in your phone list
that I took some money.

1029
00:52:18,959 --> 00:52:20,892
You also know that it isn't true.

1030
00:52:20,961 --> 00:52:23,095
I did the right thing
with that offering.

1031
00:52:23,163 --> 00:52:25,430
You need to do the right thing
and tell the press

1032
00:52:25,499 --> 00:52:27,532
what happened in
the commissioner's office.

1033
00:52:27,601 --> 00:52:29,234
- You through?
- Yes, I'm through.

1034
00:52:29,303 --> 00:52:31,162
Then get the hell out.

1035
00:52:35,776 --> 00:52:37,776
You have no integrity

1036
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:41,026
and no character.

1037
00:53:02,972 --> 00:53:05,347
Word is, there was some shouting

1038
00:53:05,429 --> 00:53:07,563
coming from Chief Grissom's office.

1039
00:53:08,396 --> 00:53:10,363
What can I do for you now,
Chief Huffhines?

1040
00:53:10,464 --> 00:53:13,999
Well, I'm here to put
your mind at ease, actually.

1041
00:53:14,067 --> 00:53:15,901
I spoke personally with the reporters,

1042
00:53:15,977 --> 00:53:18,059
and they are dropping the story.

1043
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:20,797
I'm glad to hear it.

1044
00:53:20,866 --> 00:53:22,508
Unfortunately, the commissioner

1045
00:53:22,579 --> 00:53:24,094
can no longer endorse you.

1046
00:53:27,827 --> 00:53:29,727
- I figured.
- Come on, Wallace.

1047
00:53:29,796 --> 00:53:31,930
You understand how this stuff works.

1048
00:53:31,998 --> 00:53:34,165
And anyway, you're still in the running.

1049
00:53:34,235 --> 00:53:35,743
I very much doubt that.

1050
00:53:35,821 --> 00:53:37,502
I wouldn't say that if it weren't true.

1051
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:39,570
My understanding is that Dale Cerutti's

1052
00:53:39,639 --> 00:53:42,740
still pushing for you,
and quite frankly,

1053
00:53:42,809 --> 00:53:46,778
Carl Grissom has rubbed more
people than you the wrong way.

1054
00:53:46,846 --> 00:53:48,446
My advice?

1055
00:53:48,515 --> 00:53:51,326
Lay low, and, uh...

1056
00:53:51,885 --> 00:53:56,132
maybe ease up on
the shouting at headquarters.

1057
00:53:58,591 --> 00:54:00,437
Copy that.

1058
00:54:01,261 --> 00:54:03,249
Yeah.

1059
00:54:11,705 --> 00:54:13,438
I've been thinking.

1060
00:54:13,506 --> 00:54:15,378
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1061
00:54:16,743 --> 00:54:19,110
Why don't we adopt?

1062
00:54:19,179 --> 00:54:21,379
I wanna be a dad,
and it doesn't matter to me

1063
00:54:21,448 --> 00:54:22,814
if we're the birth parents if we take...

1064
00:54:22,882 --> 00:54:25,483
After what we went through with Louie?

1065
00:54:25,552 --> 00:54:26,818
That won't happen again.

1066
00:54:26,886 --> 00:54:28,386
'Cause I'm not going through it again.

1067
00:54:28,455 --> 00:54:30,688
No way I'm gonna risk it.

1068
00:54:30,757 --> 00:54:33,057
But you'll risk your own health?

1069
00:54:33,126 --> 00:54:34,310
Matt,

1070
00:54:34,794 --> 00:54:36,770
what happened with Louie...

1071
00:54:41,801 --> 00:54:46,037
What happened was
gut-wrenching and painful,

1072
00:54:46,106 --> 00:54:49,107
and it nearly broke me.

1073
00:54:51,311 --> 00:54:53,172
We have a plan.

1074
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,868
Forget the fertility clinic.
Let's stick to the plan.

1075
00:55:11,531 --> 00:55:13,097
And why do you think so, Lieutenant?

1076
00:55:13,166 --> 00:55:14,899
Because of my 16 years of service

1077
00:55:14,968 --> 00:55:16,567
to the Chicago Fire Department.

1078
00:55:16,636 --> 00:55:18,069
But you've never actually worked

1079
00:55:18,138 --> 00:55:19,771
in the office of fire investigation.

1080
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:21,977
I've worked with them on many occasions.

1081
00:55:22,055 --> 00:55:23,608
Okay, well, how many is many?

1082
00:55:23,676 --> 00:55:25,777
Is it one? Two? Ten?

1083
00:55:25,845 --> 00:55:28,546
Over the years, 64.

1084
00:55:28,615 --> 00:55:31,215
Good. Yes, yes, yes, precision.

1085
00:55:31,284 --> 00:55:33,551
That is exactly the kind
of thing that's needed

1086
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:35,086
to instill confidence in this jury.

1087
00:55:35,155 --> 00:55:37,755
You stay calm, you stick
to the facts just like that.

1088
00:55:37,824 --> 00:55:39,950
I've never gotten to see you in action.

1089
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:42,942
It's impressive.

1090
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:45,463
Thank you.

1091
00:55:45,532 --> 00:55:47,432
Okay...

1092
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,967
Lieutenant Severide,

1093
00:55:50,036 --> 00:55:53,471
can you show me in
this diagram right here

1094
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:56,040
where the OFI determined
that the fire started?

1095
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:21,999
<i>Ambulance 61.
Man down from unknown causes.</i>

1096
00:56:22,068 --> 00:56:24,001
<i>58 West Cicero.</i>

1097
00:56:52,765 --> 00:56:55,199
Ooh, how you doing there...

1098
00:56:55,268 --> 00:56:57,001
Spencer.

1099
00:56:57,070 --> 00:56:58,769
What happened?

1100
00:56:58,838 --> 00:57:01,273
Slipped.

1101
00:57:01,608 --> 00:57:03,040
Can we come in?

1102
00:57:03,109 --> 00:57:05,376
I guess.

1103
00:57:05,445 --> 00:57:07,879
You guys bring any food?

1104
00:57:07,947 --> 00:57:10,448
Uh, no, that's Postmates.

1105
00:57:10,517 --> 00:57:12,803
Can you call them?

1106
00:57:12,886 --> 00:57:15,720
Yeah, what do you want? Nuggets? Fries?

1107
00:57:15,788 --> 00:57:18,990
- Yeeeah.
- Aww, man.

1108
00:57:19,058 --> 00:57:21,025
First shift didn't restock the jump bag.

1109
00:57:21,094 --> 00:57:23,060
I'm gonna go grab some gauze
and Kerlix from the ambo.

1110
00:57:23,129 --> 00:57:25,296
- I can do it.
- No, no, no, I got it.

1111
00:57:25,365 --> 00:57:28,199
All right, let's see.

1112
00:57:28,268 --> 00:57:31,035
Do you have any towels
in the kitchen, or...

1113
00:57:31,104 --> 00:57:32,229
No idea.

1114
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:34,526
Well, I gotta stop
this cut from bleeding.

1115
00:57:35,775 --> 00:57:38,409
My neighbor's messed up.

1116
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,746
What?

1117
00:57:41,814 --> 00:57:45,966
She's messed up.

1118
00:57:46,653 --> 00:57:48,646
Back there.

1119
00:58:06,539 --> 00:58:09,439
See? Messed up.

1120
00:58:09,976 --> 00:58:11,892
Help.

1121
00:58:12,779 --> 00:58:15,063
Main, I need a 10-1.

1122
00:58:15,848 --> 00:58:18,616
A-Ambulance 61 to Main.

1123
00:58:18,685 --> 00:58:21,625
- Main, can you read me?
- Help, help.

1124
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:23,140
Here.

1125
00:58:23,203 --> 00:58:25,278
- My girls.
- Don't, don't.

1126
00:58:25,333 --> 00:58:27,825
- Don't talk.
- I have to.

1127
00:58:28,328 --> 00:58:31,325
- Gabby!
- Shh, quit yelling.

1128
00:58:32,699 --> 00:58:34,298
Spencer, go back into the other room.

1129
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,700
You gotta quit yelling.

1130
00:58:35,768 --> 00:58:38,074
I mean it! Now!

1131
00:58:45,178 --> 00:58:47,545
No, no, no, no. No, don't.

1132
00:58:47,614 --> 00:58:50,748
- No, ma'am, ma'am.
- Wendy.

1133
00:58:50,817 --> 00:58:54,752
My partner... my partner
is coming right back.

1134
00:58:54,821 --> 00:58:56,721
Okay? You just have to stick with me.

1135
00:58:56,789 --> 00:58:59,105
My girls.

1136
00:59:01,761 --> 00:59:03,628
My girls...

1137
00:59:03,696 --> 00:59:05,496
- It's okay.
- Brett?

1138
00:59:05,565 --> 00:59:08,566
Gabby! Call a 10-1!

1139
00:59:08,635 --> 00:59:11,836
- He stabbed her.
- He's gone.

1140
00:59:11,904 --> 00:59:14,171
Ambulance 61, we need a 10-1.

1141
00:59:15,908 --> 00:59:18,643
Ugh, okay, Ambulance 61, we need a 10-1!

1142
00:59:18,745 --> 00:59:20,411
- Can you hear me?
- Okay.

1143
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,513
I'm sorry.

1144
00:59:22,582 --> 00:59:23,848
Hey, they're on their way.

1145
00:59:23,916 --> 00:59:25,683
Tell them.

1146
00:59:25,752 --> 00:59:28,452
- No, no, Wendy.
- Tell them.

1147
00:59:28,521 --> 00:59:30,121
No.

1148
00:59:30,189 --> 00:59:32,356
No, no.

1149
00:59:32,425 --> 00:59:35,525
No, no, Wendy, Wendy, wait.

1150
00:59:35,593 --> 00:59:38,118
Wendy, no.

1151
00:59:39,098 --> 00:59:41,023
No.

1152
01:00:16,061 --> 01:00:18,251
Cops are on the way.

1153
01:00:34,215 --> 01:00:36,266
We received a call...
"man down from unknown causes."

1154
01:00:36,377 --> 01:00:38,375
We went up to apartment 16.

1155
01:00:38,454 --> 01:00:39,586
He answered the door,

1156
01:00:39,665 --> 01:00:41,602
so we thought the apartment was his.

1157
01:00:42,025 --> 01:00:44,058
Actually, he lived down the hall.

1158
01:00:44,127 --> 01:00:45,518
No idea why he did it,

1159
01:00:45,596 --> 01:00:47,395
other than gakked out of his mind.

1160
01:00:47,463 --> 01:00:48,799
We're sending a couple of uniforms

1161
01:00:48,877 --> 01:00:51,299
to the day school for the daughters.

1162
01:00:53,202 --> 01:00:55,202
I'll call you later
if I need anything more.

1163
01:00:55,271 --> 01:00:57,238
Okay, thanks.

1164
01:01:04,814 --> 01:01:06,388
You okay?

1165
01:01:09,485 --> 01:01:11,252
Come on, let's go home.

1166
01:01:38,735 --> 01:01:41,916
Hey, we heard. You okay?

1167
01:01:41,984 --> 01:01:45,686
Yeah... no, it was a...
it was a rough call.

1168
01:01:45,781 --> 01:01:48,923
I just need to breathe. I'm good.

1169
01:01:48,991 --> 01:01:50,958
Take as much time as you need.

1170
01:01:51,027 --> 01:01:54,295
I'll take 61 out of service
until you give me the go ahead.

1171
01:01:54,363 --> 01:01:57,131
Oh, that's not necessary, Chief.

1172
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:02,002
I-I'm good to go.

1173
01:02:02,071 --> 01:02:03,871
You sure?

1174
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:06,385
Yeah, yeah, we're okay.

1175
01:02:21,023 --> 01:02:22,890
I'm sorry about everything.

1176
01:02:22,959 --> 01:02:24,892
I don't wanna fight anymore.

1177
01:02:24,961 --> 01:02:26,305
Me neither.

1178
01:02:26,896 --> 01:02:29,383
I have an errand to run, but...

1179
01:02:29,966 --> 01:02:33,334
maybe we can set aside
lunch today and just...

1180
01:02:33,402 --> 01:02:35,579
talk everything out?

1181
01:02:35,872 --> 01:02:37,984
Yeah, I'd like that.

1182
01:02:48,636 --> 01:02:49,975
Welcome to Caring Hill.

1183
01:02:50,021 --> 01:02:51,685
Hello, I'm Matt Casey.

1184
01:02:51,754 --> 01:02:54,303
I called earlier for
an appointment with Devon.

1185
01:02:54,365 --> 01:02:58,017
Oh, yes, I'm Devon Dawsey.
I'm the one you spoke with.

1186
01:02:58,094 --> 01:02:59,827
Ah, nice to meet you.

1187
01:02:59,896 --> 01:03:01,328
Come on in, Matt.

1188
01:03:01,397 --> 01:03:02,997
Is your wife here?

1189
01:03:03,065 --> 01:03:04,498
No, no, no,

1190
01:03:04,567 --> 01:03:07,067
I'm on a fact-finding
mission for both of us.

1191
01:03:07,136 --> 01:03:08,702
Huh, okay, well, come on in,

1192
01:03:08,771 --> 01:03:11,839
and I'll give you
a rundown on how we operate.

1193
01:03:11,908 --> 01:03:13,498
Thanks.

1194
01:03:15,144 --> 01:03:17,778
Well, if Carl Grissom
makes Commissioner,

1195
01:03:17,847 --> 01:03:19,299
expect some changes.

1196
01:03:19,345 --> 01:03:21,849
Any new appointment
is gonna make his mark.

1197
01:03:21,918 --> 01:03:24,185
I mean 51 changes.

1198
01:03:24,253 --> 01:03:25,586
Come on, you think?

1199
01:03:25,655 --> 01:03:27,788
You guys talking about
the commissioner spot?

1200
01:03:27,857 --> 01:03:30,624
- Hey, Jerebko.
- What're you hearing?

1201
01:03:30,693 --> 01:03:32,393
I got a buddy
who works down at city hall.

1202
01:03:32,461 --> 01:03:34,094
Says the mayor's asking for analytics.

1203
01:03:34,163 --> 01:03:36,564
Wants to make a real informed
choice so as to, you know,

1204
01:03:36,632 --> 01:03:37,932
push back against the Chicago wave

1205
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,466
of handing out big jobs to your friends.

1206
01:03:39,535 --> 01:03:41,272
That's gotta work in Boden's favor.

1207
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:43,600
Eh, that's not what
my captain at 99's saying.

1208
01:03:43,662 --> 01:03:45,573
Says Grissom's district
has the best statistics

1209
01:03:45,641 --> 01:03:49,061
in all the CFD... more calls,
more saves, everything.

1210
01:03:49,139 --> 01:03:51,245
Well, I'm gonna hold out
hope that the best man

1211
01:03:51,314 --> 01:03:53,380
- wins in the end.
- Hey,

1212
01:03:53,449 --> 01:03:54,748
any of you guys seen Brett?

1213
01:03:54,817 --> 01:03:56,617
No, I thought she was at the apartment.

1214
01:03:56,686 --> 01:03:58,552
She was, but then she left.

1215
01:03:58,621 --> 01:04:00,254
She looked a little distraught,
so I was hoping

1216
01:04:00,323 --> 01:04:02,122
she came here to be with friends.

1217
01:04:02,191 --> 01:04:03,968
Haven't seen her.

1218
01:04:42,249 --> 01:04:43,890
Kelly, hi.

1219
01:04:44,007 --> 01:04:45,676
I'd like to introduce you to

1220
01:04:45,746 --> 01:04:49,988
Firefighters Alec Burks
and this is Dan Exum.

1221
01:04:50,074 --> 01:04:53,670
These are the men that were
injured during the accident.

1222
01:04:53,733 --> 01:04:55,432
This is Lieutenant Kelly Severide.

1223
01:04:55,506 --> 01:04:58,207
Can't thank you enough
for testifying on our behalf.

1224
01:04:58,275 --> 01:05:00,175
- It means a lot.
- Glad to do it.

1225
01:05:00,244 --> 01:05:01,944
- Hope it helps.
- Oh, it will.

1226
01:05:02,012 --> 01:05:03,612
All right, gentlemen.

1227
01:05:03,681 --> 01:05:05,848
So there is a conference room

1228
01:05:05,916 --> 01:05:09,585
set up to hold the witnesses in
before the trial goes underway.

1229
01:05:11,255 --> 01:05:12,688
You seen Severide?

1230
01:05:12,757 --> 01:05:15,000
I need to go over some
equipment requests with him.

1231
01:05:15,113 --> 01:05:18,214
Uh, he's taken a furlough day.

1232
01:05:18,362 --> 01:05:20,579
Oh, right, he's testifying.

1233
01:05:20,651 --> 01:05:22,451
Mm-hmm.

1234
01:05:22,524 --> 01:05:24,892
My understanding is,
it's an important case

1235
01:05:24,972 --> 01:05:26,706
for firefighters' safety.

1236
01:05:26,736 --> 01:05:29,619
Yeah, that's what he keeps saying.

1237
01:05:31,764 --> 01:05:33,111
Hey.

1238
01:05:34,532 --> 01:05:36,398
What's up?

1239
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:37,793
Nothing.

1240
01:05:37,861 --> 01:05:39,595
Nothing, I just, I, um...

1241
01:05:39,663 --> 01:05:42,666
I'm just ready for things to
get back to normal around here.

1242
01:05:44,969 --> 01:05:46,902
You and me both.

1243
01:05:46,971 --> 01:05:48,299
Yeah.

1244
01:05:51,475 --> 01:05:53,233
Hey.

1245
01:06:02,786 --> 01:06:04,752
What's this?

1246
01:06:05,789 --> 01:06:09,088
Just... hear me out.

1247
01:06:14,164 --> 01:06:16,665
I wanted to gather all
the information I could,

1248
01:06:16,734 --> 01:06:18,066
and put it out on the table

1249
01:06:18,135 --> 01:06:20,435
so we could make an informed decision.

1250
01:06:20,504 --> 01:06:22,237
I reached out to an adoption consultant

1251
01:06:22,306 --> 01:06:24,506
who was really impressive.

1252
01:06:24,575 --> 01:06:26,525
You'd like her.

1253
01:06:26,595 --> 01:06:29,863
And this isn't like Louie's situation.

1254
01:06:29,941 --> 01:06:33,609
These kids aren't
from the foster system.

1255
01:06:33,678 --> 01:06:35,377
Devon can help us find a young couple

1256
01:06:35,446 --> 01:06:37,021
who maybe isn't ready for parenthood,

1257
01:06:37,097 --> 01:06:39,951
and we can adopt the baby from birth.

1258
01:06:40,051 --> 01:06:43,357
We can be the only parents
our child would ever know.

1259
01:06:45,556 --> 01:06:46,789
And...

1260
01:06:46,949 --> 01:06:50,480
why did you think it'd be okay
to talk to them without me?

1261
01:06:54,932 --> 01:06:59,235
Well, if we're being fair,
this isn't just your decision,

1262
01:06:59,303 --> 01:07:00,870
as much as you wanna think it is.

1263
01:07:00,938 --> 01:07:03,572
- I have some say here...
- What happens in five years

1264
01:07:03,641 --> 01:07:06,475
when the birth mother decides
she is ready for parenthood?

1265
01:07:06,544 --> 01:07:08,844
What happens when she sues for custody?

1266
01:07:08,913 --> 01:07:11,046
Our information can be private, Gabby.

1267
01:07:11,115 --> 01:07:14,817
Okay, 'cause that
worked out so great last time.

1268
01:07:14,886 --> 01:07:16,752
Maybe you don't remember
a stranger on our doorstep

1269
01:07:16,821 --> 01:07:19,221
on our wedding day, but I do.

1270
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:22,324
I am not adopting, Matt.

1271
01:07:25,897 --> 01:07:28,831
I wanna have my own baby.

1272
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:30,699
Why is that so hard
for you to understand?

1273
01:07:30,768 --> 01:07:34,904
Well, I want to also,
but, Gabby, you can't have one.

1274
01:07:43,314 --> 01:07:45,915
I didn't mean it...

1275
01:07:45,983 --> 01:07:48,284
<i>Ambulance 61. Bicycle accident.</i>

1276
01:07:48,352 --> 01:07:50,443
<i>32 West Madison.</i>

1277
01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:29,058
Hey, what happened?

1278
01:08:29,126 --> 01:08:30,793
What's it look like?

1279
01:08:30,861 --> 01:08:32,404
It looks like you ran your bicycle

1280
01:08:32,469 --> 01:08:34,349
through a sidewalk sign.

1281
01:08:36,534 --> 01:08:39,873
- Let me take a look.
- Okay, easy, easy.

1282
01:08:41,413 --> 01:08:42,713
Looks like you may have broken it.

1283
01:08:42,781 --> 01:08:45,340
Brett, gauze and a sling.

1284
01:08:46,986 --> 01:08:48,252
Brett.

1285
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:49,920
- What?
- Gauze and a sling.

1286
01:08:49,989 --> 01:08:53,423
- I thought you said scissors.
- I didn't.

1287
01:08:53,492 --> 01:08:54,925
- Okay.
- Come on, Brett,

1288
01:08:54,994 --> 01:08:56,493
- gauze and a sling, let's go.
- I'm getting them.

1289
01:08:56,562 --> 01:08:58,534
Then do it.

1290
01:09:15,781 --> 01:09:18,615
Lieutenant, what happens

1291
01:09:18,684 --> 01:09:21,184
to a company when it
cuts corners like this?

1292
01:09:21,253 --> 01:09:24,855
If they get away with it,
if nothing goes wrong,

1293
01:09:24,924 --> 01:09:26,456
they stand to make a lot of money.

1294
01:09:26,525 --> 01:09:28,926
Objection. Speculation.

1295
01:09:28,994 --> 01:09:31,895
Your Honor,
this is Lieutenant Severide's

1296
01:09:31,964 --> 01:09:34,965
expert testimony in his own words.

1297
01:09:35,034 --> 01:09:37,467
- I'll allow it.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

1298
01:09:37,536 --> 01:09:40,637
And, Lieutenant, in 16 years of service

1299
01:09:40,706 --> 01:09:42,606
to the Chicago fire department,

1300
01:09:42,675 --> 01:09:44,942
have you ever seen negligence like this,

1301
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:48,078
in terms of a company's
compliance to the fire code?

1302
01:09:48,147 --> 01:09:49,889
Sure, lots of times.

1303
01:09:51,317 --> 01:09:55,385
That's when we get called in
to drag out dead bodies.

1304
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:06,689
No further questions, Your Honor.

1305
01:10:13,739 --> 01:10:15,439
Brett.

1306
01:10:15,507 --> 01:10:16,832
Sylvie.

1307
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:19,343
Listen, I'm sorry I jumped you
on that call, I just had a...

1308
01:10:19,411 --> 01:10:23,180
I have never been spoken to
like that before in my life...

1309
01:10:23,248 --> 01:10:24,848
not on the sidewalk, not at work,

1310
01:10:24,917 --> 01:10:27,017
certainly not by someone who's
supposed to be my partner.

1311
01:10:27,086 --> 01:10:29,186
- That was in front of a victim.
- No, I know, I'm sorry.

1312
01:10:29,254 --> 01:10:30,618
- I had... I had this...
- Gabby,

1313
01:10:30,677 --> 01:10:32,610
I don't care what you
had going on in your life.

1314
01:10:32,696 --> 01:10:34,524
I have things going on too.

1315
01:10:34,593 --> 01:10:37,294
I treat you with respect
every time the bells go off.

1316
01:10:37,363 --> 01:10:39,096
If you can't do the same for me,

1317
01:10:39,164 --> 01:10:41,105
don't ride with me on 61.

1318
01:10:41,934 --> 01:10:43,200
Brett.

1319
01:11:12,231 --> 01:11:15,465
Rough couple of days, huh?

1320
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:22,976
Well...

1321
01:11:23,776 --> 01:11:27,093
I'm here, just so you know.

1322
01:11:29,203 --> 01:11:31,609
I do know that.

1323
01:11:38,057 --> 01:11:41,575
Your friendship means
the world to me, Joe.

1324
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:44,653
Thank you.

1325
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,314
I feel the same way.

1326
01:12:11,256 --> 01:12:14,057
So, um, the defense team

1327
01:12:14,126 --> 01:12:17,060
just approached us
with an offer to settle.

1328
01:12:17,121 --> 01:12:18,954
What does that mean?

1329
01:12:19,031 --> 01:12:21,698
That means they thought your
testimony landed with the jury.

1330
01:12:21,767 --> 01:12:23,633
You did it, man. You did it for us.

1331
01:12:23,702 --> 01:12:26,403
- Brought them to their knees.
- Congratulations, gentlemen.

1332
01:12:26,472 --> 01:12:28,138
This trial is over.

1333
01:12:28,207 --> 01:12:30,607
- We gotta call the guys.
- Oh, yeah, they're gonna flip.

1334
01:12:36,315 --> 01:12:38,188
Thank you.

1335
01:12:56,047 --> 01:12:58,375
- You need a ride?
- Oh.

1336
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:00,958
Uh, no,

1337
01:13:01,082 --> 01:13:03,578
Kelly was gonna swing by and pick me up.

1338
01:13:07,081 --> 01:13:10,460
Where are you?

1339
01:13:13,731 --> 01:13:16,458
<i>Hey, this is Kelly. Leave a message.</i>

1340
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,405
Hey.

1341
01:13:24,489 --> 01:13:26,939
- It's quitting time. What're you doing?
- Hold on a second.

1342
01:13:27,011 --> 01:13:28,310
I wanna get to the Eggsperience

1343
01:13:28,346 --> 01:13:29,406
before the crowd gets there.

1344
01:13:29,484 --> 01:13:31,031
They have a special
on scramblers that...

1345
01:13:31,095 --> 01:13:32,734
Just wait.

1346
01:13:34,662 --> 01:13:36,462
Okay.

1347
01:13:36,608 --> 01:13:38,670
What's going on, Otis?

1348
01:13:38,746 --> 01:13:40,880
When Jerebko said that
Grissom had the best statistics

1349
01:13:40,948 --> 01:13:43,482
in the CFD, that rang
an alarm bell for me.

1350
01:13:43,551 --> 01:13:45,758
One of the things I worked on
while I was laid up

1351
01:13:45,828 --> 01:13:48,487
were the incident reports and
being able to cross-reference

1352
01:13:48,556 --> 01:13:50,856
the numbers across
every district citywide.

1353
01:13:50,925 --> 01:13:52,958
English, Otis. Please.

1354
01:13:54,562 --> 01:13:56,562
These are the statistics
for Chief Grissom's district

1355
01:13:56,636 --> 01:13:58,898
from a report I pulled two months ago.

1356
01:13:58,966 --> 01:14:00,833
And this...

1357
01:14:00,902 --> 01:14:04,011
this is what he turned in
to the mayor's office.

1358
01:14:06,526 --> 01:14:10,299
Mm-hmm. He cooked the books?

1359
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:12,937
And he's done it on
every single progress report

1360
01:14:13,006 --> 01:14:15,222
dating back a dozen years.

1361
01:14:17,277 --> 01:14:20,044
We have to tell the mayor's office.

1362
01:14:20,113 --> 01:14:23,114
Not before we tell Boden.

1363
01:14:27,287 --> 01:14:28,942
Chief.

1364
01:14:31,291 --> 01:14:32,623
Fellas.

1365
01:14:32,692 --> 01:14:35,927
We have something to show you.

1366
01:14:39,432 --> 01:14:41,132
What is this?

1367
01:14:41,201 --> 01:14:43,901
Chief Grissom's progress reports.

1368
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:46,604
He's been tampering with
the numbers since 2006

1369
01:14:46,673 --> 01:14:49,707
to make himself look
more effective to the mayor.

1370
01:14:52,645 --> 01:14:54,946
- You sure?
- He changed the numbers.

1371
01:14:55,014 --> 01:14:56,447
I've seen the source code,

1372
01:14:56,516 --> 01:14:58,544
and the amendments came
straight from his office.

1373
01:14:58,638 --> 01:14:59,784
If there's a better explanation,

1374
01:14:59,853 --> 01:15:01,990
I'd love to hear it.

1375
01:15:15,668 --> 01:15:19,337
Hey.

1376
01:15:19,405 --> 01:15:21,785
You left work without me.

1377
01:15:26,222 --> 01:15:29,269
Yeah, I just needed to clear my head.

1378
01:15:34,354 --> 01:15:36,438
What I said before,

1379
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:39,227
about having a baby...

1380
01:15:39,859 --> 01:15:41,458
it came out wrong.

1381
01:15:43,797 --> 01:15:46,809
I just meant that
I can't risk losing you,

1382
01:15:48,067 --> 01:15:50,614
no matter how low the odds.

1383
01:15:55,542 --> 01:15:58,009
It's my risk, not yours.

1384
01:15:58,645 --> 01:16:01,095
And I'm willing to take it.

1385
01:16:08,188 --> 01:16:10,938
I guess that's the crux of it...

1386
01:16:12,156 --> 01:16:13,925
the thing I've never really understood.

1387
01:16:13,993 --> 01:16:15,626
What?

1388
01:16:17,137 --> 01:16:20,090
When you adopted Louie without me,

1389
01:16:20,633 --> 01:16:24,068
when you hid the fact that
you were helping Bria.

1390
01:16:24,137 --> 01:16:27,271
You make these big, emotional decisions

1391
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:30,208
as if my input doesn't matter.

1392
01:16:30,276 --> 01:16:32,577
Baby, of course it matters.

1393
01:16:32,645 --> 01:16:35,155
I care deeply how you feel,

1394
01:16:35,315 --> 01:16:38,916
but I can't be dependent on it
or on you.

1395
01:16:38,985 --> 01:16:41,304
Why not, Gabby?

1396
01:16:43,656 --> 01:16:45,323
What's wrong with being
dependent on someone

1397
01:16:45,391 --> 01:16:48,177
who loves you with everything he has?

1398
01:16:54,667 --> 01:16:57,554
This is one decision
you can't leave me out of.

1399
01:16:59,038 --> 01:17:01,249
Either we're in it together,

1400
01:17:02,175 --> 01:17:04,617
or we're not in it at all.

1401
01:17:14,187 --> 01:17:15,686
You know who I am.

1402
01:17:15,755 --> 01:17:17,255
You knew it when you married me.

1403
01:17:17,323 --> 01:17:18,910
I haven't changed.

1404
01:17:27,767 --> 01:17:30,527
It used to be the thing
you loved about me.

1405
01:17:41,233 --> 01:17:43,672
I'll, um...

1406
01:17:48,621 --> 01:17:50,562
I'll come back in a little while.

1407
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:32,930
Kelly?

1408
01:19:05,531 --> 01:19:07,301
I thought you were gonna pick me up.

1409
01:19:07,411 --> 01:19:09,400
You did? No, I was waiting for you.

1410
01:19:09,469 --> 01:19:11,569
I stayed here.

1411
01:19:16,309 --> 01:19:19,310
Uh, did you win?

1412
01:19:19,379 --> 01:19:21,545
Yeah, case is over.

1413
01:19:27,186 --> 01:19:29,196
And, um,

1414
01:19:29,845 --> 01:19:32,233
what about Renee?

1415
01:19:33,659 --> 01:19:35,493
I told her congratulations,

1416
01:19:35,561 --> 01:19:37,762
and there's no reason

1417
01:19:37,830 --> 01:19:40,538
to see each other again.

1418
01:19:42,001 --> 01:19:44,007
Then I came here.

1419
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:49,601
Grand gesture.

1420
01:19:53,012 --> 01:19:54,559
Huh?

1421
01:20:07,339 --> 01:20:09,655
I just missed you.

1422
01:20:15,957 --> 01:20:19,316
All I think about... is you.

1423
01:20:43,563 --> 01:20:45,665
Chief Huffhines.

1424
01:20:46,099 --> 01:20:47,364
What's going on?

1425
01:20:47,425 --> 01:20:49,305
You didn't hear?

1426
01:20:51,070 --> 01:20:54,193
Mayor just appointed
the CFD's next commissioner...

1427
01:20:55,182 --> 01:20:56,841
Carl Grissom.

1428
01:21:06,853 --> 01:21:08,986
Well, this is a proud day for me.

1429
01:21:09,055 --> 01:21:11,655
This is something I have
worked hard toward

1430
01:21:11,724 --> 01:21:14,196
for the last 40 plus years.

1431
01:21:14,712 --> 01:21:19,297
I look forward to scrutinizing
every aspect of the CFD

1432
01:21:19,383 --> 01:21:21,594
and bringing it in line
with what a city as great

1433
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:24,702

And with that, I'll take some questions.

1435
01:21:43,556 --> 01:21:46,557
Excuse me, can you point me
to Chief Hatcher's office?

1436
01:21:46,626 --> 01:21:48,485
He's right there.

1437
01:21:49,595 --> 01:21:51,524
Are you looking for me?

1438
01:21:53,132 --> 01:21:55,571
Tell me more about Puerto Rico.

1
00:00:00,711 --> 00:00:03,281
I could get used to this.

2
00:00:03,681 --> 00:00:06,101
- Stella?
- What are you doing here?

3
00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:09,162
I felt so lonely. I can't
survive without you.

4
00:00:09,195 --> 00:00:11,464
Alderman Casey, Susan Weller.
Political consultant.

5
00:00:11,497 --> 00:00:13,599
<i>I think you've got a
national future ahead of you</i>

6
00:00:13,632 --> 00:00:15,468
and I can get you there.

7
00:00:15,502 --> 00:00:17,471
<i>I might actually have a shot</i>

8
00:00:17,503 --> 00:00:18,903
at fostering Louie after all.

9
00:00:18,914 --> 00:00:20,716
- What?
- You two have a connection.

10
00:00:20,748 --> 00:00:22,850
I won't let that go unnoticed.

11
00:00:22,883 --> 00:00:24,786
I can't stop going over it in my head.

12
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:29,257
Chief never makes the decision lightly.

13
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,126
Well, he was dead wrong!

14
00:00:47,976 --> 00:00:49,376
Hey, Chief.

15
00:00:49,377 --> 00:00:50,912
Do you really need
these by end of shift,

16
00:00:50,945 --> 00:00:53,414
or can we think on them some?

17
00:00:53,447 --> 00:00:57,819
On my third shift as candidate on Truck,

18
00:00:57,853 --> 00:01:00,956
we lost Mikey Philo
in the Superior fire.

19
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:02,857
We all got back to the house,

20
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,859
pulled off our turnout gear,
put on our work boots.

21
00:01:04,893 --> 00:01:10,399
Mikey's boots had just stood
untouched for a month

22
00:01:13,834 --> 00:01:17,772
That was a reminder.

23
00:01:17,805 --> 00:01:20,475
These are about having no regrets.

24
00:01:20,508 --> 00:01:23,879
So... end of shift, please.

25
00:01:36,858 --> 00:01:38,694
It was tougher than I expected.

26
00:01:38,727 --> 00:01:43,132
Yeah, well, it's a tradition
worth bringing back.

27
00:01:43,165 --> 00:01:46,168
Chief.

28
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,702
Hey, sorry I'm late, guys.

29
00:01:47,736 --> 00:01:50,038
Um, let's go talk in my office.

30
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,039
If it's all the same to you,
I'd like to get changed

31
00:01:52,073 --> 00:01:53,542
and get to work.

32
00:01:53,575 --> 00:01:55,510
Okay, go get dressed.

33
00:01:58,245 --> 00:02:00,248
It goes without saying, people,

34
00:02:00,281 --> 00:02:04,085
we are here for him, whatever he needs.

35
00:02:05,853 --> 00:02:09,290
Dawson, someone here to
see you, apparatus floor.

36
00:02:15,163 --> 00:02:16,563
Hey, Ms. Cantrell.

37
00:02:16,564 --> 00:02:19,367
I was on my way in and
realized I'm still waiting

38
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:21,302
for an update on your living situation.

39
00:02:21,336 --> 00:02:22,871
I know. I'm close.

40
00:02:22,903 --> 00:02:24,406
Just dotting a couple of "I" s.

41
00:02:24,438 --> 00:02:27,408
I'm under pressure to place
Louie with a family.

42
00:02:27,442 --> 00:02:29,278
- Okay...
- This week.

43
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:31,313
I'm looking at an apartment
as soon as shift's over

44
00:02:31,314 --> 00:02:32,446
that's be perfect for us.

45
00:02:32,447 --> 00:02:34,182
Give me three, four days tops,

46
00:02:34,216 --> 00:02:35,751
and I'll be ready for a home inspection.

47
00:02:35,783 --> 00:02:38,186
I sympathize. I do.

48
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:41,323
But there are other worthy
foster families in line,

49
00:02:41,355 --> 00:02:45,793
and for the child's well-being,
I can't delay any longer.

50
00:02:45,794 --> 00:02:47,093
Two days.

51
00:02:48,497 --> 00:02:49,898
<i>Ambulance 61, emergency upgrade.</i>

52
00:02:49,931 --> 00:02:52,701
- I'll make it work.<i>
- EMS plan one...</i>

53
00:02:54,936 --> 00:02:57,105
Jimmy, are you sure about this?

54
00:02:57,138 --> 00:02:58,538
Yeah, let's go.

55
00:03:14,656 --> 00:03:18,694
All right, let me know
when you guys are done.

56
00:03:18,727 --> 00:03:21,295
Jimmy, hey.

57
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:22,831
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:26,334 --> 00:03:28,804
Jimmy, come on.

59
00:03:28,836 --> 00:03:31,372
Borrelli, I'm sorry about your brother.

60
00:03:31,373 --> 00:03:32,506
Thanks, Chief.

61
00:03:32,507 --> 00:03:33,942
Where do you need us, Chief Hatcher?

62
00:03:33,974 --> 00:03:36,711
I've got some smoke inhalation
victims over there by 152.

63
00:03:36,745 --> 00:03:39,114
Randolph!

64
00:03:43,818 --> 00:03:45,621
- Okay?
- Everybody okay?

65
00:03:45,653 --> 00:03:47,555
Belzer, Grimes, do you copy?

66
00:03:47,588 --> 00:03:49,525
Report!

67
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:53,295
Set him down.

68
00:03:53,328 --> 00:03:56,765
The floor gave away. We
found him in the hallway.

69
00:03:56,766 --> 00:03:58,097
He looks pretty clean.

70
00:03:58,098 --> 00:03:59,400
How far was he from the collapse?

71
00:03:59,401 --> 00:04:00,969
About 50 feet.

72
00:04:01,002 --> 00:04:02,938
I'm not getting a pulse.

73
00:04:05,272 --> 00:04:07,508
He's having a heart attack.

74
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:09,411
- I'm gonna start compressions.
- Okay.

75
00:04:09,443 --> 00:04:11,447
- Is he dying?
- No way.

76
00:04:14,282 --> 00:04:16,651
Come on, man. Come on.

77
00:04:20,088 --> 00:04:23,459
- Hey, Jimmy, slow down.
- Borrelli, calm down.

78
00:04:24,992 --> 00:04:27,329
- Breathe.
- Jimmy. Jimmy.

79
00:04:27,362 --> 00:04:29,498
Breathe.

80
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:31,033
Jimmy, stop.

81
00:04:31,065 --> 00:04:32,867
Hey, hey, look at me.

82
00:04:32,901 --> 00:04:36,405
Look at my face. I
need you to calm down.

83
00:04:36,437 --> 00:04:38,839
Just breathe. Nice steady rhythm.

84
00:04:38,872 --> 00:04:41,877
I'm gonna put the pads on him.
We've got this.

85
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,913
All right, guys, pull him out.

86
00:04:59,627 --> 00:05:02,029
He's in V-fib. Charging.

87
00:05:02,062 --> 00:05:04,065
Clear.

88
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,639
All right, there it is. Pulse is good.

89
00:05:11,673 --> 00:05:13,408
Sinus tach. Let's get him on the rig.

90
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:27,073

91
00:05:33,784 --> 00:05:35,919
Hey, how goes the hunt for Chez Dawson?

92
00:05:35,952 --> 00:05:37,789
Uh...

93
00:05:37,822 --> 00:05:39,524
I'm waiting on my realtor.

94
00:05:39,556 --> 00:05:41,392
We're supposed to see a place
the day after tomorrow,

95
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:44,062
but I... I've got to see it sooner.

96
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,296
- What are these?
- Backups.

97
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,700
Caesarstone countertops. Fancy.

98
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:50,100
300 over budget.

99
00:05:50,101 --> 00:05:53,271
Ooh, you know what?

100
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:55,640
This is a crazy idea, but Cindy and I,

101
00:05:55,673 --> 00:05:57,742
we got an in-law apartment
above our garage.

102
00:05:57,775 --> 00:06:00,544
You would actually evict
that family of bats?

103
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:02,580
No, I appreciate it, guys, but
I'm looking for something

104
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:04,682
that's already set up and ready to go.

105
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:06,217
All right.

106
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:16,226
There is a simpler solution.

107
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,496
Move back in with me.

108
00:06:18,497 --> 00:06:19,663
Severide will understand,

109
00:06:19,664 --> 00:06:21,466
and the place will look
great to the DCFS.

110
00:06:21,498 --> 00:06:23,601
Matt, no.

111
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:27,438
We both know that's not what you want.

112
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:33,344
Hello.

113
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:35,479
Yeah. Okay.

114
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,812
Okay, great.

115
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,515
They can show the place
right now if I...

116
00:06:38,516 --> 00:06:39,716
Yeah, go.

117
00:06:39,717 --> 00:06:41,318
Thank you. I'm on my way.

118
00:06:45,188 --> 00:06:48,626
What? Oh, my God.

119
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:53,263
Uh-oh. Who's in trouble?

120
00:06:54,965 --> 00:06:57,501
Ohh, who do you think?

121
00:06:57,534 --> 00:07:01,438
Grant's been texting nonstop
since I didn't go to his gig.

122
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,605
He still using?

123
00:07:02,606 --> 00:07:06,243
Mm, four minutes ago:

124
00:07:06,277 --> 00:07:08,913
"I hope you burn to death slowly."

125
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:10,448
Hmm, two minutes ago:

126
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:13,017
"I'm sorry, baby. I love you."

127
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:14,485
You want me to talk to him?

128
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:17,288
Given our history, I think
you're probably the last person

129
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,657
that he wants to talk to.

130
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:24,596
Oh, but what can you do?

131
00:07:24,628 --> 00:07:27,265
You know, this whole thing
is making me really tense.

132
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:28,398
Ahh.

133
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,101
And, you know, like,
my neck and my back.

134
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:32,970
Oh, sounds rough.

135
00:07:33,003 --> 00:07:35,239
Maybe you should come over after shift.

136
00:07:35,272 --> 00:07:36,974
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

137
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:53,122
- Hey.
- Hey.

138
00:07:53,123 --> 00:07:55,058
Just who I came to see.

139
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:56,259
I've got good news.

140
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,695
Yeah, what's that?

141
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,129
The State Appropriations Committee

142
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:02,332
is holding a three-day summit to
discuss public safety issues,

143
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:04,868
and you are now an official invitee.

144
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,404
And somehow this is good news?

145
00:08:07,438 --> 00:08:10,408
Yes, because the Director
of Emergency Management

146
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,376
will be there, and getting
real face time with him

147
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,145
is crucial if you want to make inroads

148
00:08:14,178 --> 00:08:16,181
in updating Chicago's 911 system.

149
00:08:16,214 --> 00:08:18,683
She's not wrong. It would go a long way.

150
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:20,417
I already booked a pair of rooms

151
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,686
with stunning parking lot views
at the Springfield Marriott.

152
00:08:31,996 --> 00:08:33,497
The neighborhood's safe,

153
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,601
and the folks in 4B have two
little ones of their own.

154
00:08:36,634 --> 00:08:38,169
It's perfect.

155
00:08:38,202 --> 00:08:39,604
And with the park across the street,

156
00:08:39,636 --> 00:08:43,174
you two'll be spending all of
your time outside in the summer.

157
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:44,943
How much?

158
00:08:44,976 --> 00:08:47,712
It's a little more than you
said you could afford.

159
00:08:47,745 --> 00:08:49,246
In fact, it's a lot more.

160
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,083
I'll take it.

161
00:10:01,117 --> 00:10:05,255
Just want to say, Danny was family.

162
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:07,558
That makes you family, too, brother.

163
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:09,294
Anything you need.

164
00:10:09,327 --> 00:10:11,962
Thanks, Paul.

165
00:10:11,996 --> 00:10:14,265
You guys meant the world to Danny too.

166
00:10:14,298 --> 00:10:15,698
I'll walk you out.

167
00:10:21,938 --> 00:10:25,242
Hey, I wanted to ask you

168
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:27,844
about the choices that
were made that day.

169
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,913
You mean by Boden?

170
00:10:29,947 --> 00:10:32,049
And that extra minute?

171
00:10:32,082 --> 00:10:34,117
The building was coming down.

172
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,421
We all saw it.

173
00:10:37,454 --> 00:10:39,656
It's all I can do not
to drive over there

174
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:41,693
and punch him in the mouth.

175
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:43,695
If you want to get out
from under that bastard,

176
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:47,698
I'll sign your pink myself,
transfer you here.

177
00:10:59,508 --> 00:11:03,512
Application's in, which it
should be a rubber stamp.

178
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:06,351
So that means it's all
about the home inspection.

179
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,329
I sincerely offered my
place to make it work,

180
00:11:11,363 --> 00:11:13,132
and you dismissed it flat.

181
00:11:15,332 --> 00:11:17,101
I'm trying, Gabby.

182
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,638
Well, don't.

183
00:11:19,738 --> 00:11:21,138
You shouldn't have to try.

184
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,074
I'm gonna do what's right for Louie,

185
00:11:23,108 --> 00:11:24,710
and that starts with giving him a home

186
00:11:24,743 --> 00:11:26,811
where he feels incredibly wanted.

187
00:11:26,844 --> 00:11:29,215
- Like Boden said, no regrets.
- That's not fair.

188
00:11:29,248 --> 00:11:30,682
Be honest with yourself, Matt.

189
00:11:30,683 --> 00:11:31,848
I want something that you don't.

190
00:11:31,849 --> 00:11:33,084
I'm ready, and you're not.

191
00:11:33,085 --> 00:11:34,519
It's not a crime,

192
00:11:34,552 --> 00:11:36,254
and it doesn't make you
any less of a man.

193
00:11:39,325 --> 00:11:42,295
I'll be off next shift.

194
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,962
There's a summit on public
safety in Springfield,

195
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,563
and Susan wants me to go.

196
00:11:45,596 --> 00:11:48,533
Susan.

197
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:50,635
Uh-huh.

198
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,071
Sounds fun.

199
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,152
Chief.

200
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:08,955
Ah, close the door. Have a seat.

201
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:24,036
Coming back to work after
a loss like yours,

202
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:25,771
is never easy.

203
00:12:25,804 --> 00:12:27,506
There's no right time
or wrong time to do it.

204
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,542
Now is the right time.

205
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:32,311
Well, I can appreciate
you feel that way.

206
00:12:32,344 --> 00:12:34,013
Good.

207
00:12:35,346 --> 00:12:37,482
Okay.

208
00:12:37,516 --> 00:12:39,085
I got a phone call from Chief Hatcher.

209
00:12:39,118 --> 00:12:41,186
He said that you were pretty aggressive

210
00:12:41,187 --> 00:12:42,387
in your last run.

211
00:12:42,388 --> 00:12:46,224
I need your head working
as much as your heart.

212
00:12:46,258 --> 00:12:47,960
Focus, clarity.

213
00:12:47,993 --> 00:12:49,628
That saves lives.

214
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:51,130
We saved a life today.

215
00:12:51,162 --> 00:12:52,562
What about you?

216
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:56,701
Excuse me?

217
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,638
I was just thinking that as a chief

218
00:12:59,671 --> 00:13:01,373
you do a lot of telling
people what to do

219
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:03,575
without actually doing
very much yourself.

220
00:13:07,445 --> 00:13:09,614
Anything else?

221
00:13:12,151 --> 00:13:13,551
No.

222
00:13:21,893 --> 00:13:23,628
Leave it open.

223
00:13:30,536 --> 00:13:33,372
Deputy District Chief's Office, please.

224
00:13:33,405 --> 00:13:35,508
It's Wallace Boden.

225
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:38,878
Chief Tiberg? Yes.

226
00:13:38,911 --> 00:13:42,147
We need to talk about Jimmy Borrelli.

227
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,493
Yeah.

228
00:13:56,762 --> 00:14:00,032
Oh, my God, what are you doing here?

229
00:14:00,065 --> 00:14:02,767
Well, up until about ten seconds ago,

230
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:06,772
I had the bang-up idea of forgiving you

231
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,205
for not coming to my show, and...
I don't know...

232
00:14:08,206 --> 00:14:11,210
maybe sweeping you off your feet,

233
00:14:11,243 --> 00:14:15,181
but now I know exactly what's going on.

234
00:14:15,214 --> 00:14:17,550
Are we really having
this conversation again?

235
00:14:17,551 --> 00:14:18,849
You're disgusting.

236
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,318
- What?
- You're nasty.

237
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:23,822
You... you... have a nice life, Stella.

238
00:14:23,855 --> 00:14:25,256
Have a real great life, you know,

239
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,959
'cause I was just fine before you,

240
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:30,029
and I'm gonna be fine long after you.

241
00:14:30,061 --> 00:14:32,764
That's for sure.

242
00:14:32,765 --> 00:14:33,964
Just some bitch I used to nail.

243
00:14:33,965 --> 00:14:35,967
- That's all.
- Okay.

244
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:51,015
Safe to say he got the message.

245
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,382
Looks like he took it well.

246
00:14:52,383 --> 00:14:55,421
Okay, all right, let's
talk about anything,

247
00:14:55,454 --> 00:14:58,157
anything at all besides me.

248
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,892
Home study with the DCFS inspector

249
00:14:59,925 --> 00:15:01,760
scheduled for tomorrow, check.

250
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:05,563
Realtor on her way with the
lease right now, check.

251
00:15:05,596 --> 00:15:08,800
Gabriela Dawson kicking
ass and taking names.

252
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:11,070
Check, check.

253
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,705
Good luck.

254
00:15:12,738 --> 00:15:14,540
Casey's in Springfield?

255
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:17,041
Saving the world as usual.

256
00:15:17,075 --> 00:15:19,110
Need I remind you you wanted him

257
00:15:19,143 --> 00:15:20,845
to run for alderman.

258
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,981
Yeah, I know.

259
00:15:23,014 --> 00:15:25,350
But you want him here?

260
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,253
Not if he doesn't want to be here.

261
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,493
Vanessa.

262
00:15:35,627 --> 00:15:37,027
What?

263
00:15:37,028 --> 00:15:40,265
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

264
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:41,332
Okay.

265
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,469
I really tried to change his mind.

266
00:15:43,502 --> 00:15:44,904
- Whose?
- The landlord's.

267
00:15:44,936 --> 00:15:46,504
He's gonna give the
apartment to his daughter.

268
00:15:46,505 --> 00:15:47,805
She just graduated from college.

269
00:15:47,806 --> 00:15:49,006
No.

270
00:15:49,007 --> 00:15:50,642
Give me a couple of days to dig.

271
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:53,012
I'll find something else. I promise.

272
00:16:07,421 --> 00:16:08,955
Okay.

273
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,554
Agh.

274
00:16:10,874 --> 00:16:13,010
Don't... don't worry about that door.

275
00:16:13,035 --> 00:16:14,670
We'll get that fixed up, no problem.

276
00:16:14,702 --> 00:16:18,940
Yeah, so it might need a little TLC

277
00:16:18,965 --> 00:16:20,868
but nothing we can't handle, right?

278
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:24,305
Hey, when's that inspector coming by?

279
00:16:24,337 --> 00:16:27,107
Uh... 6:00 p.m.

280
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:28,440
Okay.

281
00:16:28,441 --> 00:16:30,777
Today.

282
00:16:30,811 --> 00:16:34,882
All right. Okay, well, you know,

283
00:16:34,915 --> 00:16:36,784
it might not be a Gold Coast penthouse,

284
00:16:36,816 --> 00:16:39,220
but, you know, it's got a special charm

285
00:16:39,221 --> 00:16:40,252
about it, you know.

286
00:16:41,789 --> 00:16:43,089
Oh.

287
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:46,359
Ahh, I should've warned you about that.

288
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:47,793
Sorry.

289
00:16:47,795 --> 00:16:50,598
You know, just got to get
rid of this dust, you know,

290
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:55,669
get past that broken door,
move some stuff around.

291
00:17:01,742 --> 00:17:05,146
I won that stupid monkey at Navy Pier,

292
00:17:05,178 --> 00:17:06,913
and I'll be damned if it wasn't

293
00:17:06,946 --> 00:17:09,650
every one of my kids' favorite toy.

294
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:13,154
There's something about it.

295
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:21,061
This place is perfect, Herrmann.

296
00:17:21,094 --> 00:17:24,564
Thank you.

297
00:17:24,598 --> 00:17:26,934
No problem, kid.

298
00:17:26,966 --> 00:17:28,835
Anything for you.

299
00:17:28,869 --> 00:17:31,805
I'm calling in reinforcements.

300
00:17:35,408 --> 00:17:37,911
- We've got four hours.
- Ah...

301
00:17:40,113 --> 00:17:43,350
We can do this. We have to.

302
00:17:43,384 --> 00:17:46,753
Not standing here like a
bunch of boobs we can't.

303
00:17:46,786 --> 00:17:48,689
Let's go, people.

304
00:17:59,465 --> 00:18:02,335
We're right down the
hall from each other.

305
00:18:02,369 --> 00:18:04,672
- Okay.
- And here we go.

306
00:18:04,705 --> 00:18:07,608
Senators Reynard and
Twigg and Mark Hanson,

307
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,075
who's the director of
Emergency Management.

308
00:18:09,076 --> 00:18:10,275
Copy.

309
00:18:10,276 --> 00:18:12,379
Director Hanson, you
owe me a phone call.

310
00:18:12,413 --> 00:18:15,249
And a Glenlivet on the rocks.
Hello, Susan.

311
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,549
This is Alderman Matt Casey,

312
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,351
the Chicago firefighter
I told you about.

313
00:18:18,385 --> 00:18:19,987
Oh, yes, heard amazing things about you.

314
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,589
All lies, all lies.

315
00:18:21,621 --> 00:18:23,623
Don't you firefighters have
some kind of easy schedule?

316
00:18:28,128 --> 00:18:30,431
We're 24 on, 48 off.

317
00:18:30,464 --> 00:18:32,200
Three-day work week. Must be nice.

318
00:18:36,236 --> 00:18:37,938
When we're not running
into burning buildings,

319
00:18:37,972 --> 00:18:40,241
I guess it is nice, sure.

320
00:18:40,273 --> 00:18:41,876
These guys do amazing work.

321
00:18:41,908 --> 00:18:43,543
We're going to grab lunch.
You should join us.

322
00:18:43,544 --> 00:18:44,711
We should.

323
00:18:44,712 --> 00:18:46,714
Matt wants to talk to you
about the 911 system.

324
00:18:46,746 --> 00:18:48,682
That's right, I would.

325
00:18:48,715 --> 00:18:51,718
Sounds like we better get that
scotch with the appetizers.

326
00:19:14,641 --> 00:19:16,042
Gabby, this is Marvin.

327
00:19:16,075 --> 00:19:17,978
He'll be doing the evaluation.

328
00:19:17,979 --> 00:19:19,078
Yes, hi.

329
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:20,815
Thank you so much for coming today.

330
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:24,817
Oh, excuse me.

331
00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:31,591
You got this.

332
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:34,595
I'm not sure what good
brown-nosing would do,

333
00:19:34,628 --> 00:19:38,398
but Gabriela Dawson is the
most incredible woman I know.

334
00:19:50,043 --> 00:19:52,545
So you know, there's another family.

335
00:19:52,546 --> 00:19:53,846
the Gambrells.

336
00:19:53,847 --> 00:19:55,449
They have three foster kids currently,

337
00:19:55,482 --> 00:19:57,652
and they're ready to
take Louie tomorrow.

338
00:20:01,655 --> 00:20:05,460
Well, I'm ready to take Louie right now.

339
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,986
Is that paint?

340
00:20:31,987 --> 00:20:33,352
Yeah, yes.

341
00:20:33,353 --> 00:20:34,821
We just touched it up a little bit.

342
00:20:34,855 --> 00:20:36,724
I wanted everything to
be perfect for Louie.

343
00:20:36,756 --> 00:20:39,159
Oh, here, let me give
you a hand with that.

344
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:52,540
I was in a jam.

345
00:20:52,572 --> 00:20:54,809
I had an apartment lined up,

346
00:20:54,841 --> 00:20:57,210
but it fell through,
and my friends rallied

347
00:20:57,244 --> 00:20:58,812
to get this place the best they could

348
00:20:58,813 --> 00:21:00,079
with the time that we had.

349
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,749
And I know it needs a lot of work,

350
00:21:01,782 --> 00:21:04,118
but believe me when I say
that my firehouse family

351
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,120
made a miracle happen today.

352
00:21:07,154 --> 00:21:09,290
And it's just a taste of
the love Louie's gonna get

353
00:21:09,322 --> 00:21:11,292
once he comes home here with me.

354
00:21:13,292 --> 00:21:15,228
Okay, thank you.

355
00:21:18,631 --> 00:21:20,031
We'll be in touch.

356
00:21:26,706 --> 00:21:28,908
- Hey.
- There you are.

357
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:30,076
Director Hanson heard you were a golfer.

358
00:21:30,077 --> 00:21:31,712
Wants to invite you out to Medinah.

359
00:21:31,744 --> 00:21:34,080
Good. And the 911 system?

360
00:21:34,113 --> 00:21:36,082
You've got his support, but
now you've got to convince

361
00:21:36,116 --> 00:21:37,885
the appropriations committee.

362
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:39,486
Okay.

363
00:21:42,889 --> 00:21:44,859
Chief.

364
00:21:44,891 --> 00:21:46,292
Jimmy, come on in.

365
00:21:46,293 --> 00:21:47,560
I want to talk to you about Danny.

366
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:48,828
As do I.

367
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:50,598
I had a conversation with Chief Tiberg.

368
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,932
He and I both thought that
maybe the best way to keep

369
00:21:52,965 --> 00:21:55,168
your brother's memory alive
would be for you to take

370
00:21:55,202 --> 00:21:57,304
Danny's badge number for your own.

371
00:21:57,305 --> 00:21:58,670
That is, if you're interested.

372
00:21:58,671 --> 00:22:01,675
And we can present the badge
officially at the memorial.

373
00:22:07,414 --> 00:22:10,551
Okay, Jimmy.

374
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,285
I know you're going over
that day in your head.

375
00:22:13,753 --> 00:22:15,488
I'm doing the same thing,

376
00:22:15,522 --> 00:22:17,691
but that's how we all improve.

377
00:22:17,724 --> 00:22:22,530
That's how future lives are saved.

378
00:22:22,562 --> 00:22:24,598
One minute.

379
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,802
That is what you said,
and it got him killed.

380
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:31,905
Your brother thought he heard someone.

381
00:22:31,938 --> 00:22:35,275
He made a choice to go back in.

382
00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:38,012
I as chief made a choice to let him.

383
00:22:39,312 --> 00:22:42,582
- A choice?
- Yeah.

384
00:22:42,616 --> 00:22:45,520
Just like I made the choice
to come in and get you.

385
00:22:53,526 --> 00:22:55,895
Your brother made a sacrifice

386
00:22:55,928 --> 00:22:59,099
for something that he believed in.

387
00:22:59,131 --> 00:23:01,168
And he died a hero.

388
00:23:04,771 --> 00:23:07,375
All right.

389
00:23:12,713 --> 00:23:15,850
Oy, first shift back you're
gonna treat me like that?

390
00:23:15,882 --> 00:23:17,717
Mail-order B12 shots.

391
00:23:17,718 --> 00:23:18,885
Brain cells are growing
like winter wheat

392
00:23:18,886 --> 00:23:21,355
and spring has sprung.

393
00:23:21,388 --> 00:23:25,326
What?

394
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:29,496
Hey, did you guys hear that
old McGill at 22 retired?

395
00:23:29,497 --> 00:23:30,829
He wasn't that old.

396
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:33,399
Wasn't that old? Crusty old bastard.

397
00:23:33,433 --> 00:23:35,436
He slept in his turnout pants
so he wouldn't be the last guy

398
00:23:35,468 --> 00:23:37,370
on the engine if the
bells went off at night.

399
00:23:37,371 --> 00:23:38,737
Who the hell does that?

400
00:23:48,482 --> 00:23:50,050
What is it?

401
00:23:50,082 --> 00:23:54,321
I don't know. Something's wrong.

402
00:23:54,353 --> 00:23:56,356
Who? Grant?

403
00:23:58,591 --> 00:24:00,061
Hello, Grant?

404
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,230
Wait. Slow down.

405
00:24:04,263 --> 00:24:06,667
Grant, you're not making sense.

406
00:24:08,303 --> 00:24:09,467
Damn it.

407
00:24:09,468 --> 00:24:10,703
Stella, talk to me.

408
00:24:10,704 --> 00:24:12,104
He's on something.

409
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,476
We're on the same account.

410
00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:16,909
I can use "find my phone."

411
00:24:20,147 --> 00:24:21,547
Lincoln Park.

412
00:24:33,994 --> 00:24:35,394
Fan out.

413
00:24:35,395 --> 00:24:36,931
Grant.

414
00:24:36,964 --> 00:24:38,933
Grant!

415
00:24:38,965 --> 00:24:40,365
Grant!

416
00:24:44,103 --> 00:24:45,503
Grant!

417
00:24:47,674 --> 00:24:49,710
We need a stretcher on
the north footbridge.

418
00:24:49,711 --> 00:24:50,943
Oh, my God.

419
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:53,113
Shallow breathing, pinpoint pupils.

420
00:24:53,114 --> 00:24:54,312
All right, let's get him elevated.

421
00:24:54,313 --> 00:24:55,713
Grant.

422
00:24:58,649 --> 00:25:00,252
I need two milligrams of Narcan.

423
00:25:00,284 --> 00:25:02,320
I'll get an IV going.

424
00:25:02,321 --> 00:25:03,654
Grant, just listen to my voice.

425
00:25:03,655 --> 00:25:04,821
Stay with me, okay?

426
00:25:04,822 --> 00:25:06,222
Can you hear me? Grant.

427
00:25:10,227 --> 00:25:13,131
He's not responding.
Still not breathing.

428
00:25:14,866 --> 00:25:17,269
I'm gonna push two more.

429
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,509
Pushing two now.

430
00:25:28,413 --> 00:25:29,882
Okay, okay, we got you.

431
00:25:32,183 --> 00:25:33,583
Let's get him up.

432
00:25:39,124 --> 00:25:40,793
Hey.

433
00:25:59,176 --> 00:26:00,576
Did I...

434
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:02,711
Yeah.

435
00:26:03,782 --> 00:26:05,282
Stupid.

436
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:07,685
You need help, Grant.

437
00:26:07,718 --> 00:26:09,321
I need you.

438
00:26:09,353 --> 00:26:12,023
No, you need to get clean.

439
00:26:13,858 --> 00:26:16,762
You... you don't know
how hard it is for me.

440
00:26:21,398 --> 00:26:22,868
You have no idea.

441
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,302
Stop. Stop.

442
00:26:25,336 --> 00:26:28,907
I am done with the excuses.

443
00:26:30,108 --> 00:26:31,743
You're done?

444
00:26:31,775 --> 00:26:33,344
- Yeah.
- All right.

445
00:26:33,378 --> 00:26:34,980
Then leave.

446
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:37,782
- Grant...
- Leave!

447
00:26:37,815 --> 00:26:40,084
Leave! Get the hell out of here!

448
00:26:41,886 --> 00:26:44,623
Go!

449
00:26:44,656 --> 00:26:46,424
Stella.

450
00:26:46,456 --> 00:26:49,427
Stella.

451
00:26:56,967 --> 00:27:00,705
Dr. Charles, um...

452
00:27:00,737 --> 00:27:04,308
Look, Stella, rock bottom
always looks ugly.

453
00:27:04,341 --> 00:27:06,544
Doesn't mean it's the end.

454
00:27:06,578 --> 00:27:09,013
You absolutely did your
part getting him here.

455
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:10,681
I want you to try and let him go for now

456
00:27:10,715 --> 00:27:13,083
and let us do our thing.

457
00:27:13,117 --> 00:27:16,521
Promise to keep you informed, okay?

458
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:18,556
Okay.

459
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:21,459
- Thank you.
- Of course.

460
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:26,630
The OEMC Director says maybe
they can start the upgrades

461
00:27:26,664 --> 00:27:28,934
in three months, so by
this time next year,

462
00:27:28,966 --> 00:27:31,570
the 911 system should
have a complete overhaul.

463
00:27:31,602 --> 00:27:34,538
Well, that is
fantastic news, Alderman.

464
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:37,775
And things there?

465
00:27:37,776 --> 00:27:38,908
Dawson?

466
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:40,911
Uh, you haven't spoken to her?

467
00:27:40,945 --> 00:27:42,880
We left it up in the air.

468
00:27:42,914 --> 00:27:47,051
Well, there is no news on that front.

469
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:50,888
<i>You just finish up your
job there in Springfield</i>

470
00:27:50,921 --> 00:27:53,724
and we will hold down the
fort here in the meantime.

471
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:56,360
<i>Sounds good. Thanks, Chief.</i>

472
00:27:56,394 --> 00:27:57,794
Okay.

473
00:28:03,435 --> 00:28:04,835
You wanted to see me, Chief?

474
00:28:04,836 --> 00:28:06,572
Yeah, come on in.

475
00:28:07,571 --> 00:28:09,340
Can you please explain to me

476
00:28:09,374 --> 00:28:11,810
why I still do not have
a letter from you?

477
00:28:15,545 --> 00:28:18,182
This is a...

478
00:28:18,215 --> 00:28:21,719
this is a very complicated
time right now.

479
00:28:24,722 --> 00:28:26,724
I just want to do it right.

480
00:28:26,757 --> 00:28:29,093
Gabby, if I push...

481
00:28:30,928 --> 00:28:33,063
It's because I care.

482
00:28:33,097 --> 00:28:34,800
I know, Chief.

483
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,938
So how'd I do?

484
00:28:40,972 --> 00:28:42,407
I've been saying it for months.

485
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:44,575
You're a natural. Phew.

486
00:28:48,745 --> 00:28:52,082
Matt, you've got a way about you.

487
00:28:52,116 --> 00:28:54,719
All the cynicism and phoniness

488
00:28:54,752 --> 00:28:58,290
that's part of the game
just rolls right off you.

489
00:28:58,322 --> 00:29:00,157
It's a very attractive quality.

490
00:29:02,526 --> 00:29:05,696
When it comes to building
political allies, I mean.

491
00:29:10,467 --> 00:29:13,571
How about a run for state Senate?

492
00:29:13,603 --> 00:29:15,072
There's a seat opening up in the fall,

493
00:29:15,106 --> 00:29:17,643
and I wouldn't bring it up if
I didn't think it was real.

494
00:29:20,978 --> 00:29:22,680
The truth is,

495
00:29:22,714 --> 00:29:25,582
Susan, my future...

496
00:29:25,616 --> 00:29:29,087
independent of being an alderman
and being a firefighter,

497
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:31,656
it's just...

498
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:35,092
it's all uncertain right now.

499
00:29:35,126 --> 00:29:37,796
I understand

500
00:29:37,829 --> 00:29:40,698
and I want to assure you...

501
00:29:42,132 --> 00:29:45,202
I'm here when you say yes.

502
00:30:08,993 --> 00:30:12,797
<i>Engine 51, Truck 81, Squad 3, Ambo 61,</i>

503
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:14,130
<i>Structure Fire, 4738 North Avenue.</i>

504
00:30:14,131 --> 00:30:15,531
Mouch.

505
00:30:16,767 --> 00:30:18,167
Mouch.

506
00:30:18,168 --> 00:30:19,568
Ahh...

507
00:30:23,374 --> 00:30:24,774
Mouch, come on.

508
00:30:24,775 --> 00:30:26,677
Wake up.

509
00:30:26,711 --> 00:30:29,247
Mouch, hey.

510
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,016
Mouch!

511
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:32,450
Yep.

512
00:30:32,483 --> 00:30:34,652
Yep, yep, yep.

513
00:30:34,685 --> 00:30:36,988
Let's go!

514
00:30:55,673 --> 00:30:57,342
Okay, 51, get a line in there.

515
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:59,244
Squad, start on the top floor.

516
00:30:59,276 --> 00:31:02,013
Truck, fifth floor.
Get that roof vented.

517
00:31:02,014 --> 00:31:03,245
Copy that.

518
00:31:03,246 --> 00:31:04,983
Hey, Otis, Mouch, to the roof.

519
00:31:05,015 --> 00:31:07,752
Dawson, Kidd, you're with me.

520
00:31:17,528 --> 00:31:20,231
Hey, we got one on the stairs here!

521
00:31:20,263 --> 00:31:21,933
Let's go!

522
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:23,801
Hey! Hey! I got her.

523
00:31:23,834 --> 00:31:25,402
You two clear the floor.

524
00:31:25,436 --> 00:31:28,106
Copy.

525
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:36,246
Clear this one!

526
00:31:44,956 --> 00:31:46,356
Clear!

527
00:31:46,357 --> 00:31:48,126
One more, then we're out.

528
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:49,828
<i>Top floor is clear, Chief.</i>

529
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,662
Work your way down, Squad.

530
00:31:51,696 --> 00:31:53,197
<i>Copy that.</i>

531
00:31:57,135 --> 00:31:58,736
Check that.

532
00:31:58,737 --> 00:32:00,035
Everyone out now.

533
00:32:00,036 --> 00:32:02,639
<i>The fire's moving up too quickly.</i>

534
00:32:02,673 --> 00:32:05,410
Copy that, Chief.

535
00:32:05,443 --> 00:32:06,945
<i>Copy that, Chief.</i>

536
00:32:13,785 --> 00:32:15,185
Go back!

537
00:32:15,186 --> 00:32:16,319
Mayday! Mayday!

538
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,323
Fifth floor corner unit,
northeast corner.

539
00:32:19,357 --> 00:32:21,493
<i>Don't have much time.
Fire's moving quickly.</i>

540
00:32:21,525 --> 00:32:23,193
Northeast corner?

541
00:32:23,226 --> 00:32:25,295
This is Mouch. We can drop a lifeline.

542
00:32:25,296 --> 00:32:26,362
Then do it!

543
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:28,365
And get that ladder over there now.

544
00:32:30,834 --> 00:32:32,837
We're good.

545
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,811
You first.

546
00:32:40,844 --> 00:32:42,713
- No.
- Hey, no arguments!

547
00:32:42,746 --> 00:32:45,115
I got seniority, and I
call the shots! Go!

548
00:33:04,801 --> 00:33:06,538
Okay.

549
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:11,342
Come on. Come on.

550
00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:19,884
This place is gonna go, Chief.

551
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:22,486
Gabby, get on that line
and get out of there.

552
00:33:25,688 --> 00:33:27,088
- Watch it!
- We got you.

553
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:28,489
Dawson!

554
00:33:30,372 --> 00:33:32,241
Dawson, talk to me.

555
00:33:46,642 --> 00:33:48,042
There she is!

556
00:34:06,695 --> 00:34:08,431
Hold on, Dawson!

557
00:34:16,905 --> 00:34:19,408
Hold on.

558
00:34:23,911 --> 00:34:26,114
Hang on. I gotcha. Come on.

559
00:34:27,683 --> 00:34:30,119
Yeah, I gotcha.

560
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:31,987
I gotcha.

561
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:35,191
I'm okay.

562
00:35:13,594 --> 00:35:16,231
Hi.

563
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,469
Congratulations.

564
00:35:21,503 --> 00:35:23,271
You'll make a great mom.

565
00:35:50,798 --> 00:35:52,198
Hey, Stace.

566
00:35:56,938 --> 00:35:59,674
Hey, you guys, how you holding up?

567
00:36:06,213 --> 00:36:07,683
Well, this is everything

568
00:36:07,715 --> 00:36:11,654
that was in his locker, you know?

569
00:36:17,826 --> 00:36:19,427
Look, if there's anything I can do,

570
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:20,828
you know, watch the kids or...

571
00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:24,867
I heard from the guys at 67, Jimmy.

572
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,468
The rumors.

573
00:36:26,501 --> 00:36:28,037
What kind of rumors?

574
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:31,941
That your chief made a bad call,

575
00:36:31,974 --> 00:36:33,709
that Dan shouldn't have
been in that building,

576
00:36:33,742 --> 00:36:35,278
that he didn't have to die.

577
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:40,248
Is it true, Jimmy?

578
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:42,785
Hey.

579
00:36:42,818 --> 00:36:45,220
Hey, they are just rumors, Stace.

580
00:36:45,253 --> 00:36:47,023
Danny died a hero.

581
00:36:48,422 --> 00:36:50,492
Okay?

582
00:36:52,626 --> 00:36:55,496
I just don't know what
I'm do gonna, Jimmy.

583
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,365
Hey, come here. Come here.

584
00:36:57,398 --> 00:37:01,871
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

585
00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:06,708
This is your new home.

586
00:37:06,742 --> 00:37:08,277
Come on.

587
00:37:42,277 --> 00:37:43,677
Hey.

588
00:38:01,228 --> 00:38:04,899
<i>Dear Louie, Chief Boden
asked us to write letters</i>

589
00:38:04,933 --> 00:38:06,367
<i>to a loved one in case something</i>

590
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,770
<i>ever went wrong on a call.</i>

591
00:38:11,672 --> 00:38:15,943
<i>I had the hardest time
writing this letter,</i>

592
00:38:15,976 --> 00:38:18,112
<i>until you came into my life.</i>

593
00:38:20,282 --> 00:38:23,818
<i>I've given up a lot to get where I am,</i>

594
00:38:23,851 --> 00:38:26,487
<i>but when I look at you,</i>

595
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:28,591
<i>I know it was all worth it.</i>

596
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:34,363
<i>I want you to know that
the life I've lived,</i>

597
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:37,633
<i>the sacrifices I made,</i>

598
00:38:37,666 --> 00:38:41,937
<i>it was in the service of helping others.</i>

599
00:38:41,969 --> 00:38:46,942
<i>Sacrifice is the hardest
of all human actions,</i>

600
00:38:46,974 --> 00:38:50,511
<i>but anyone who puts on a
uniform to help others</i>

601
00:38:50,545 --> 00:38:54,115
<i>knows it's also the most important.</i>

602
00:38:55,317 --> 00:38:58,686
<i>We pay a price for our service.</i>

603
00:39:00,121 --> 00:39:01,521
Wallace.

604
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:05,527
Where's the kid?

605
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:07,563
Don't know.

606
00:39:10,532 --> 00:39:15,071
<i>And sometimes that price
is beyond our limits.</i>

607
00:39:19,574 --> 00:39:21,777
You were amazing, like a superhero.

608
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:23,978
Oh, come on. We were amazing.

609
00:39:23,979 --> 00:39:25,346
I never should have doubted you.

610
00:39:25,347 --> 00:39:27,016
This trip was a great idea.

611
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:29,483
It still is.

612
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:49,304
<i>I've made mistakes and bad choices,</i>

613
00:39:49,337 --> 00:39:53,108
<i>but life has a way of giving
all of us second chances.</i>

614
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:42,224
<i>Never doubt the power of
goodness in one's heart</i>

615
00:40:42,257 --> 00:40:45,527
<i>or for a single second that together</i>

616
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:49,864
<i>we make an incredible family</i>

617
00:40:49,898 --> 00:40:53,903
<i>and you will be loved always.</i>

618

1
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:02,380
Do you wanna go to vegas with me?

2
00:00:02,381 --> 00:00:04,493
I'm not sure how great of an idea that is.

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,496
We'd have to put the wedding on hold

4
00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:12,798
until you've completed your
first year as candidate.

5
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:14,634
We acknowledged that, that
this kind of arrangement

6
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:16,402
could put a lot of pressure on us.

7
00:00:16,437 --> 00:00:16,769
I got a job coming up after shift.

8
00:00:18,072 --> 00:00:19,372
I could use a second set of eyes.

9
00:00:19,407 --> 00:00:20,707
What kind of job?

10
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:22,532
Go! Go! Go!

11
00:00:27,715 --> 00:00:30,049
- Hey, 'sup, Newhouse?
- 'Sup?

12
00:00:30,084 --> 00:00:31,884
Yo. Yo, man, what happened?

13
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:34,120
Ah... Come on, man, it's nothing.

14
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:37,223
You know, a misunderstanding.

15
00:00:37,258 --> 00:00:38,858
And I thought you said

16
00:00:38,893 --> 00:00:40,459
you were going to get this window fixed.

17
00:00:40,495 --> 00:00:41,794
It broke again.

18
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:43,396
What can you do?

19
00:00:43,431 --> 00:00:46,132
Look, I have two crates
of chocolates in here

20
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:50,336
that can't walk themselves
inside, so help me out, man.

21
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:51,537
Hey.

22
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,740
You would tell me if you
were jammed up, right?

23
00:00:54,776 --> 00:00:56,475
Hell, yeah.

24
00:00:56,511 --> 00:00:58,010
We're boys.

25
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:04,450
- Okay, I need a volunteer.
- Nope.

26
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:05,885
No way.

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,587
You guys, Molly's II is
almost up and running.

28
00:01:08,623 --> 00:01:10,089
Do we have a menu? No.

29
00:01:10,124 --> 00:01:12,491
Do we have a cook? No. At
least I'm doing something.

30
00:01:12,527 --> 00:01:14,560
Listen to your colleague here.

31
00:01:14,595 --> 00:01:15,928
No.

32
00:01:15,963 --> 00:01:18,931
I was very specific about
the time table afforded.

33
00:01:18,966 --> 00:01:20,466
Eight weeks, okay,

34
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:22,668
and you've burned through
half of it already.

35
00:01:22,704 --> 00:01:25,271
Yeah, yeah, we'll be ready. We'll be ready.

36
00:01:25,306 --> 00:01:28,441
We just... we just need a signature dish.

37
00:01:28,476 --> 00:01:30,476
I'll try it.

38
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:32,011
Sylvie!

39
00:01:32,046 --> 00:01:33,446
No!

40
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:34,780
No.

41
00:01:39,587 --> 00:01:40,619
Tangy.

42
00:01:40,655 --> 00:01:42,154
Dominican sausage and peppers.

43
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,323
Dude, if you keep calling
your food "Dominican,"

44
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,691
I'm going to have to kick your ass

45
00:01:45,727 --> 00:01:47,026
on behalf of an entire country.

46
00:01:47,061 --> 00:01:48,894
All right, fine. Who's gonna be the cook?

47
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,663
Hey, listen, I got a cousin, you know.

48
00:01:50,698 --> 00:01:52,665
A really nice Russian girl.

49
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,833
No more cousins from you.

50
00:01:53,868 --> 00:01:54,995
Hey, it's a totally different cousin.

51
00:01:55,104 --> 00:01:59,238
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, Newhouse.

52
00:01:59,374 --> 00:02:01,006
What's the thing with the face?

53
00:02:01,042 --> 00:02:02,775
It's starting to be regular with you.

54
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,177
You got a secret fight club or
something we don't know about?

55
00:02:05,213 --> 00:02:06,612
Yeah, man, you want to join?

56
00:02:06,647 --> 00:02:08,914
What, and endanger this work of art?

57
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,683
I'll pass.

58
00:02:10,718 --> 00:02:13,052
Finally, something edible.

59
00:02:13,087 --> 00:02:14,754
3.00 bucks.

60
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:16,522
Naomi's academic decathlon team

61
00:02:16,557 --> 00:02:18,257
has made it to the finals in D.C.,

62
00:02:18,292 --> 00:02:22,261
and I need to raise $1,500
for her travel expenses.

63
00:02:22,296 --> 00:02:26,465
Hey, your kid is in the
academic decathlon finals.

64
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:28,567
You must be doing something right.

65
00:02:28,603 --> 00:02:31,370
Yeah.

66
00:02:31,406 --> 00:02:33,939
- He's alive!
- Hey, hey! Look at you!

67
00:02:33,975 --> 00:02:35,408
Hey!

68
00:02:35,443 --> 00:02:36,842
- How was Vegas?
- It was great.

69
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:39,145
It was really great. Uh, is Boden around?

70
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,846
In his office.

71
00:02:40,882 --> 00:02:42,047
Okay.

72
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:46,185
I can't get the image
out of my head of you.

73
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,053
Well, I didn't even
finish with the details...

74
00:02:48,089 --> 00:02:51,123
Chief... Mouch, great, you're here too.

75
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,258
Do you got a minute?

76
00:02:52,293 --> 00:02:53,325
Vegas!

77
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:55,795
Yeah, man! Yeah.

78
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,167
So, you look good.

79
00:03:01,202 --> 00:03:02,635
Looks like the trip was good for you.

80
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,371
Yeah. Yeah, Vegas was great.

81
00:03:05,406 --> 00:03:08,073
You know, played a little craps,
hit the pool, got some sun,

82
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:11,343
and, uh, oh, yeah.

83
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:13,212
I got married.

00:03:30,064 --> 00:03:32,031
- Congratulations.
- No, thank you, guys.

87
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:34,633
And, Mouch, I wanted to
ask you about helping me

88
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:37,570
sort out my insurance, pension,
getting her name on it...

89
00:03:37,605 --> 00:03:39,338
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

90
00:03:39,373 --> 00:03:41,140
You're serious?

91
00:03:41,175 --> 00:03:43,476
Yeah. I got married.

92
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:49,782
Uh, okay.

93
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:52,952
Well, then there's a
considerable amount of paperwork

94
00:03:52,987 --> 00:03:55,054
to be gathered, in that case.

95
00:03:55,089 --> 00:03:56,889
It'll take me some time.

96
00:03:56,924 --> 00:03:59,592
Cool. Thanks.

97
00:03:59,627 --> 00:04:00,893
Yeah.

Her name's Brittany Baker.

She's a graphic artist from Tallahassee.

101
00:04:18,584 --> 00:04:19,783
I met her at the craps table.

102
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:22,386
We hit it off. 24 hours later, boom.

Silver Bells wedding chapel.

104
00:04:24,624 --> 00:04:26,056
She's coming by later in the shift.

105
00:04:26,092 --> 00:04:28,292
You're gonna love her.
You're gonna love her.

106

All right, yeah, okay, ha, ha, ha, ha.

All right, you got us all set up.

108
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:40,404
Where's the punch line?

109
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:42,139
I got married.

110
00:04:42,174 --> 00:04:43,173
In Vegas.

Okay, great. Mazel tov!

Thank you!

114
00:04:53,986 --> 00:04:55,319
Here you go.

115
00:04:55,354 --> 00:04:56,620
Congrats, man.

116
00:04:59,392 --> 00:05:01,158
So you had to bail on the Vegas trip.

117
00:05:01,193 --> 00:05:04,161
See, this is what happens when
he's left to his own devices.

118
00:05:04,196 --> 00:05:05,596
I told you.

119
00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:07,898
My mom had a yard sale, and I had to help.

120
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,902
Whew. Hey.

121
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:15,239
Just think, you almost
went to Vegas with him.

122
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:17,241
That could've been you.

123
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:19,777
Mm. Yeah.

124
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,017
Hey, you all right?

125
00:05:27,053 --> 00:05:28,652
Yeah.

126
00:05:28,688 --> 00:05:31,555
So, this wedding thing.

127
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,657
- Legit?
- Legit.

128
00:05:33,693 --> 00:05:37,027
Look, I'm telling you, once you
meet her, you'll get it, okay?

129
00:05:37,063 --> 00:05:38,262
You're really gonna like her.

130
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:39,496
You don't need to convince me.

131
00:05:39,532 --> 00:05:41,031
If you're good, I'm good.

132
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:42,833
And she's out looking for places right now.

133
00:05:42,868 --> 00:05:45,302
We're gonna end up staying at a
hotel until we find something...

134
00:05:45,338 --> 00:05:46,937
wait, wait, what are you talking about?

135
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,072
You have a place to live.

136
00:05:48,107 --> 00:05:49,506
Nah, dude, I... we can't...

137
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:51,175
Our home is your home,

138
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,677
and that makes it her home.

139
00:05:53,713 --> 00:05:55,746
You sure you don't want
to check with Dawson first?

140
00:05:55,781 --> 00:05:58,982
Dawson's gonna say the same thing I am.

141
00:05:59,018 --> 00:06:00,117
Thank you.

142
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,418
Sure.

143
00:06:01,454 --> 00:06:03,821
So, uh, you got a photo?

144
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:08,459
I just got this one of her at the pool.

145
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,096
Huh?

146
00:06:12,131 --> 00:06:13,664
Congratulations.

147
00:06:15,267 --> 00:06:18,402
Truck 81, Squad 3, Ambulance 61.

148
00:06:18,437 --> 00:06:20,504
Single vehicle accident. Passenger trapped.

149
00:06:35,554 --> 00:06:37,554
Well, that ain't good.

150
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,256
Guys, get the extinguishers.

151
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,665
Trench is too narrow for side access.

152
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,405
Dawson, get down there and see
if we can get him out in front.

153
00:06:48,406 --> 00:06:49,406
Right.

154
00:06:55,637 --> 00:06:58,004
Hey, my name's Gabriela.

155
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,439
We're gonna get you out, all right?

156
00:06:59,474 --> 00:07:00,440
What's your name?

157
00:07:00,475 --> 00:07:01,608
Allison.

158
00:07:01,643 --> 00:07:03,777
Allison, you feel any pain?

159
00:07:03,812 --> 00:07:05,745
My... my head.

160
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:08,415
Yeah, I can see you got
a... you got a cut there.

161
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,417
Do you think that you lost consciousness?

162
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,552
Allison, look at me.

163
00:07:12,588 --> 00:07:14,020
Do not try to take off your seat belt.

164
00:07:14,056 --> 00:07:15,956
We're gonna extricate you safely.

165
00:07:15,991 --> 00:07:19,659
People... people lose air
in situations like this.

166
00:07:19,695 --> 00:07:20,961
I can't stay in here!

167
00:07:20,996 --> 00:07:21,995
I can't!

168
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,830
Allison, I know that it's scary,

169
00:07:23,865 --> 00:07:25,198
but we know what we're doing.

170
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:27,534
I just need you to give me
a couple slow, deep breaths.

171
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:29,736
In and out, in and out.

172
00:07:31,473 --> 00:07:32,772
- Yo!
- Dawson!

173
00:07:32,808 --> 00:07:35,308
Dawson, get back!

174
00:07:44,052 --> 00:07:46,519
- Can we get in there?
- Nah, it's too tight.

175
00:07:46,555 --> 00:07:49,189
We got one female trapped.

176
00:07:49,224 --> 00:07:50,657
Go in from the bottom?

177
00:07:50,692 --> 00:07:52,225
We don't have any other options.

178
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,594
Okay, we're gonna crack the frame.

179
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,596
What does cracking the frame mean?

180
00:07:56,632 --> 00:07:58,832
It's a technique we use to
take off the bottom of the car.

181
00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:00,333
Hey, Tony, grab the hurst.

182
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:01,901
Newhouse, Capp, grab sawzalls.

183
00:08:01,937 --> 00:08:04,070
We need to disassemble the exhaust.

184
00:08:04,106 --> 00:08:07,128
- Dawson!
- Just...

185
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:09,966
Herrmann, Dawson, Cruz, and Otis,

186
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:12,740
hook two come-alongs from the
front of the frame to the back.

187
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:14,824
Mouch, build a high point
in the middle with cribbing.

188
00:08:14,825 --> 00:08:15,825
Got it.

189
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,433
Hi. Allison, right?

190
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:22,568
- Yeah.
- I'm Sylvie.

191
00:08:38,504 --> 00:08:39,564
Ok. We're good.

192
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,056
Set.

193
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,057
I got it.

194
00:08:58,258 --> 00:09:01,204
Hey, hey, I know it's loud.
That sound is normal, I swear.

195
00:09:01,226 --> 00:09:03,826
No, I smell gas!

196
00:09:07,832 --> 00:09:09,298
Casey, Severide!

197
00:09:09,334 --> 00:09:12,001
Yeah, we know! Keep going, keep going.

198
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,510
All right, hold, hold.

199
00:09:20,545 --> 00:09:21,711
Good.

200
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,902
Hey, nice work, brother.

201
00:09:45,937 --> 00:09:47,136
Good stuff.

202
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:48,604
Nice work, man. Nice stuff.

203
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,906
Awesome job. Good job.

204
00:09:49,941 --> 00:09:52,441
Hey, nice job.

205
00:09:59,987 --> 00:10:01,287
You got a minute?

206
00:10:01,322 --> 00:10:02,388
Yeah, sure.

207
00:10:02,423 --> 00:10:04,223
Before I get you that paperwork,

208
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:07,827
I would be remiss if
I didn't say something.

209
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:13,699
You ever throw a pot?

210
00:10:13,735 --> 00:10:14,800
What?

211
00:10:14,836 --> 00:10:16,702
You know, like, pottery on a wheel.

212
00:10:16,738 --> 00:10:17,803
No.

213
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,672
Trudy and I took a class.

214
00:10:19,707 --> 00:10:23,309
That whole Ghost thing, very sensual.

215
00:10:23,344 --> 00:10:26,145
Anyway, you throw a pot, see,

216
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,047
and it looks pretty good,

217
00:10:28,082 --> 00:10:29,982
but you only have a short while

218
00:10:30,018 --> 00:10:33,352
to make adjustments before it dries.

219
00:10:33,388 --> 00:10:35,588
Is it really the pot for you?

220
00:10:35,623 --> 00:10:38,424
Maybe you're looking for something rounder.

221
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:41,027
You got to decide quick,

222
00:10:41,062 --> 00:10:43,562
before that pot dries

223
00:10:43,598 --> 00:10:45,598
and it's yours forever.

224
00:10:48,236 --> 00:10:51,537
So you're saying marriage is like a pot?

225
00:10:51,572 --> 00:10:53,272
Yes.

226
00:10:53,308 --> 00:10:54,974
Yes.

227
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:57,977
And nothing's dried yet, Kelly.

228
00:10:58,012 --> 00:11:00,713
Do you follow what I'm saying?

229
00:11:00,748 --> 00:11:03,082
Mouch, you ever been married?

230
00:11:03,117 --> 00:11:05,184
Not personally, no.

231
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:12,191
All right, thanks, man.

232
00:11:12,226 --> 00:11:14,393
Psst, Lieutenant.

233
00:11:16,531 --> 00:11:17,930
How long you got?

234
00:11:17,965 --> 00:11:19,765
How long I got to what?

235
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:22,201
Till this Severide marriage flames out.

236
00:11:22,236 --> 00:11:24,937
Otis, don't be a dick.

237
00:11:24,972 --> 00:11:27,973
Okay, if you don't want in on the action...

238
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,581
All right, just give me
5.00 bucks on six weeks.

239
00:11:35,616 --> 00:11:36,749
There it is.

240
00:11:40,822 --> 00:11:43,422
So, Lieutenant,

241
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:44,924
why don't you tell us a little more

242
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,859
about this crazy wedding of yours, huh?

243
00:11:46,894 --> 00:11:48,027
Start at the beginning.

244
00:11:48,062 --> 00:11:50,062
We want every detail.

245
00:11:50,098 --> 00:11:51,530
Who are you, my Aunt Ruth?

246
00:11:51,566 --> 00:11:53,599
We said, "let's get
married," we got married.

247
00:11:53,634 --> 00:11:55,434
When is she gonna be here already?

248
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,103
She'll be here, all right?

249
00:11:57,138 --> 00:11:59,138
She'll be here. Don't worry.

250
00:12:02,777 --> 00:12:05,778
Well, you got to admit, he's happy.

251
00:12:07,849 --> 00:12:10,149
"She's a graphic artist.
We met at the craps table.

252
00:12:10,184 --> 00:12:12,017
Her name is Brittany,
and she's from Florida"?

253
00:12:12,053 --> 00:12:13,152
You know what that adds up to?

254
00:12:13,187 --> 00:12:14,620
Stripper.

255
00:12:14,655 --> 00:12:17,056
What do you have against Florida?

256
00:12:17,091 --> 00:12:19,925
Are you seriously accepting
all this as normal?

257
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:23,095
I mean, when has he
ever high-fived anyone?

258
00:12:23,131 --> 00:12:24,997
Let alone the entire house?

259
00:12:25,032 --> 00:12:26,799
Gabby, he's happy.

260
00:12:26,834 --> 00:12:28,300
Who cares how he got there?

261
00:12:30,338 --> 00:12:32,772
I am asking you to find out
what is going on with him.

262
00:12:32,807 --> 00:12:34,740
And I'm telling you, I
saw the look in his eye,

263
00:12:34,776 --> 00:12:38,444
and when Kelly gets like this
he don't listen to nobody.

264
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:39,912
Who has his ear?

265
00:12:39,947 --> 00:12:41,614
Who can get through to him?

266
00:12:47,922 --> 00:12:49,188
Shay.

267
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,664
God, these calls are wiping me out.

268
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:00,366
I need to get back into shape.

269
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:02,334
Yeah, you're looking
like you're in trouble.

270
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,170
I'm serious.

271
00:13:04,205 --> 00:13:06,005
Back at home when I was
planning the wedding,

272
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,741
I used to do spinning
Mondays and Wednesdays,

273
00:13:08,776 --> 00:13:10,476
power yoga Tuesdays and Thursdays,

274
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:12,411
and box-blaster on Fridays, and...

275
00:13:12,447 --> 00:13:15,181
- Oh, box-blaster?
- It's a kickboxing workout.

276
00:13:16,651 --> 00:13:18,451
Yeah, odd name.

277
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:22,621
That's really all I did.

278
00:13:22,657 --> 00:13:25,591
Working out and making
sure dinner was ready

279
00:13:25,626 --> 00:13:28,994
by the time Harrison got home.

280
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,796
You know, we got a heavy bag

281
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:32,832
and some weights at the
house, if you want to...

282
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:36,268
Oh, do you guys have
zumba classes in Chicago?

283
00:13:36,304 --> 00:13:38,404
I do not know what that is.

284
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:39,872
Never mind.

285
00:13:39,907 --> 00:13:42,741
I'll figure it out.

286
00:13:42,777 --> 00:13:47,079
So is this like a regular
thing with Severide?

287
00:13:47,114 --> 00:13:49,849
The running off and getting married deal?

288
00:13:49,884 --> 00:13:52,485
As far as I know, this is the first.

289
00:13:54,455 --> 00:13:56,455
Just curious.

290
00:13:56,491 --> 00:13:57,756
Ambulance 61.

291
00:13:57,792 --> 00:14:01,126
Two-vehicle accident,
corner of Jackson and Rose.

292
00:14:15,343 --> 00:14:17,877
Thank God you're here.

293
00:14:17,912 --> 00:14:20,479
Right this way.

294
00:14:20,515 --> 00:14:21,914
Let me take a look at that bump.

295
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:24,316
- Were you hurt, sir?
- Nah, nah, it's all good.

296
00:14:24,352 --> 00:14:26,352
Look, the only injury
he has is the brain cells

297
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:27,753
he killed with whatever he drank.

298
00:14:27,788 --> 00:14:29,488
No way, dude. Totally sober.

299
00:14:29,524 --> 00:14:32,057
I told the lady, let's
just exchange information.

300
00:14:32,093 --> 00:14:34,159
But I know the police don't
come to a minor accident

301
00:14:34,195 --> 00:14:36,328
unless you report an injury.

302
00:14:36,364 --> 00:14:38,531
That's right, the police
are on their way now.

303
00:14:41,802 --> 00:14:43,969
Just... why don't you
go ahead and take a seat?

304
00:14:44,005 --> 00:14:46,105
- All right.
- Relax. What happened?

305
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,373
So I see the light's red,

306
00:14:47,408 --> 00:14:49,742
and I come to a complete
stop like good drivers

307
00:14:49,777 --> 00:14:51,343
are supposed to do.

308
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:52,545
He...

309
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,547
Hey, hey, Sylvie.

310
00:14:54,582 --> 00:14:56,982
That act won't save you.

311
00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:02,788
That's crack.

312
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:07,693
Okay, hold on.

313
00:15:13,744 --> 00:15:15,679
- He's seizing.
- Take that off.

314
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,683
Oh, God.

315
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:20,784
Could you...

316
00:15:25,223 --> 00:15:26,756
- De-fib.
- Charging.

317
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,592
Oh, God, oh, God, oh,
God, oh, God, oh, God...

318
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:31,394
- Clear.
- Oh, God.

319
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,663
I got rhythm back.

320
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,231
What does that mean? Is he okay?

321
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,500
Ma'am, can you please just
step back, give us some room?

322
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,269
- Thank you.
- He's still really tachy.

323
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:40,870
Can we push midazolam?

324
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:43,273
I mean, I know it won't stop
him from metabolizing the crack.

325
00:15:43,308 --> 00:15:44,674
Yeah, but it will...

326
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,643
it will slow down the
seizing. Yeah, let's do it.

327
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,389
Oh, look. He's waking up.

328
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:04,828
Ahh!

329
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,333
Guess he's not metabolizing it anymore.

330
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,140
- Hey, Mills.
- Hey.

331
00:16:17,175 --> 00:16:18,742
How's it going?

332
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,510
It's good, you?

333
00:16:20,545 --> 00:16:21,945
Great.

334
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,714
Hey, listen, man, I need a favor.

335
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,716
Can you help me out
with something tomorrow?

336
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,818
I'm not gonna be target
practice again, am I?

337
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:31,788
No, that was like a one-in-a-million thing.

338
00:16:31,823 --> 00:16:33,323
I just need you to stand by the car

339
00:16:33,358 --> 00:16:34,991
and wait while I go see someone.

340
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,559
And that's it, just stand by the car?

341
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,428
Yeah, that's all.

342
00:16:40,565 --> 00:16:42,132
What the hell is going on with you, man?

343
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,633
Nothing... it's nothing, all right?

344
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,168
It's like I told you...
it's a little minor thing

345
00:16:45,203 --> 00:16:47,103
I need to straighten out.

346
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,040
So can I count on you?

347
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:51,307
Yeah, sure.

348
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,143
Thanks, buddy.

349
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,118
Oh...

350
00:17:04,122 --> 00:17:05,922
Whoa, what happened here?

351
00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:07,457
Oh, come on, admit it.

352
00:17:07,492 --> 00:17:08,758
You miss this.

353
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:13,196
Yeah, yeah, the jealousy
is just overwhelming.

354
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:14,731
Hey, excuse me?

355
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:16,700
Hi, I'm Brittany.

356
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:19,302
I'm, uh, I'm looking for Kelly Severide.

357
00:17:19,337 --> 00:17:20,837
- I'm his...
- Oh, you're his wife.

358
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:23,506
- Yeah.
- Hi, I'm Gabby Dawson.

359
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,808
Hi, wow.

360
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,142
Oh, Dawson.

361
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:28,545
- You're the roommate, right?
- Uh, sort of.

362
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,046
Yeah, Kelly told me about you.

363
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:32,749
Said you're shaping up to
be one hell of a firefighter.

364
00:17:32,784 --> 00:17:35,218
He said that?

365
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:36,786
Huh.

366
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,154
Oh, sorry. This is Sylvie Brett.

367
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,989
She's one of the
paramedics on Ambulance 61.

368
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,858
- This is Brittany...
- Baker.

369
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:43,693
Or, uh, or Baker-Severide.

370
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,228
We haven't quite worked that out yet.

371
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:48,965
Uh, I'd shake your hand but I'm, uh...

372
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,333
it was a patient.

373
00:17:50,368 --> 00:17:52,102
I wasn't out partying or anything.

374
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,336
Obviously, I mean.

375
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:54,738
We had an ingestion O.D.,

376
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,906
which basically means a guy
ate a whole bunch of crack,

377
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,975
and it was... suddenly I'm realizing

378
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,643
you don't want to hear any of this.

379
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,012
I'm gonna go and shower now.

380
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:04,848
But, you know, welcome.

381
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,919
Congratulations and all.

382
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,221
Thank you.

383
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,158
So, come on in.

384
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,065
Guess who I found.

385
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,367
- Hey!
- Hi.

386
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,739
Hey, everybody, this is Brittany.

387
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,175
Hey!

388
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,477
All right, welcome. What have you got here?

389
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,045
Well, I read an article that said when

390
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,747
you come to a firehouse for the first time,

391
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,783
come knocking with your elbows.

392
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,084
What?

393
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,552
Because your arms are full of food.

394
00:18:42,587 --> 00:18:44,387
You know, most people overthink it.

395
00:18:44,422 --> 00:18:47,957
They get those fancy popovers
and muffins with frosting...

396
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,125
Cream puffs.

397
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,094
Now, I myself enjoy the occasional puff,

398
00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:52,862
- but en masse...
- They get soggy.

399
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,764
Exactly.

400
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,167
Oh, wow. Hi!

401
00:18:57,202 --> 00:19:00,336
And who are you? Who is this?

402
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,806
- Oh, that's Pouch.
- Well, hello.

403
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:06,609
Hey! That's the official 51
seal of approval, right there.

404
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,212
I am honored.

405
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:13,216
So I'm guessing you guys heard,

406
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:16,686
"Vegas wedding, met at the
craps table," and thought...

407
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:19,422
- Stripper.
- Hey, Capp, not cool.

408
00:19:19,457 --> 00:19:21,958
No, no, no, actually I don't blame him.

409
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:25,028
It sounds crazy to me and
I was there, but, uh...

410
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,263
but it's been really great.

411
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,432
Well, this calls for a celebration.

412
00:19:29,467 --> 00:19:30,800
Friday night, Molly's.

413
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:31,901
Oh, yeah. Hell, yeah.

414
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,203
Friday night at Molly's.

415
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:36,005
And I tell you what, 15% off all the drinks

416
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,409
in honor of the happy couple here.

417
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,444
This is so bizarre.

418
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:44,881
- Hi. Brittany.
- Hey.

419
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:48,318
Hey, um, thanks for
letting Brittany move in.

420
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,487
We won't take long to find a place.

421
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,289
Yeah, of course.

422
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:54,524
Appreciate it.

423
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,428
She's moving into our house?

424
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:01,231
Remind me to tell you that
Brittany is moving in with us.

425
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,600
What... we don't even know who she is.

426
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,001
He doesn't even know who she is.

427
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:08,238
What, you think he married a serial killer?

428
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,006
Why are you so okay with this?

429
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,241
Severide's a big boy.

430
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,109
He can do what he wants.

431
00:20:14,512 --> 00:20:17,814
Look, however this plays out, good or bad,

432
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:20,183
he's gonna need me on his side.

433
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:21,417
So you can do what you want,

434
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,286
but that's where I'm gonna be.

435
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,300
Hey, congratulations again.

436
00:20:37,335 --> 00:20:38,768
Thanks.

437
00:20:38,803 --> 00:20:40,803
And thanks for letting
her crash for a while.

438
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,475
Are you okay?

439
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,044
Yeah, I'm better than okay.

440
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:50,613
I'm great.

441
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:54,484
It just seems like ever since...

442
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,719
ever since Shay died,
you've been avoiding...

443
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,889
Why can't you just be happy
that I'm happy, Dawson?

444
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,559
Because I'm not sure that you are happy.

445
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,962
I think... I think
maybe that you're hiding,

446
00:21:05,997 --> 00:21:09,399
and I know that Shay
wouldn't want that for you.

447
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,801
Yeah?

448
00:21:11,836 --> 00:21:14,871
You think she'd want you putting
your wedding on hold forever?

449
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:16,372
No, that's completely different.

450
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:19,242
Look, some people,

451
00:21:19,277 --> 00:21:22,078
they get married when they know
it's right, however quick it is,

452
00:21:22,113 --> 00:21:24,881
and some people, they put it off.

453
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,183
Maybe you're doing what's
right for you and Matt.

454
00:21:27,218 --> 00:21:30,620
Just, before you accuse anyone of hiding...

455
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:34,857
check and make sure you're
not doing that yourself.

456
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:52,942
I'll just be a minute.

457
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,959
I just came by to tell you I'm done.

458
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,594
You're done?

459
00:22:11,629 --> 00:22:14,998
Anybody can see the only way
this goes is south, so I'm out.

460
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:41,958
Done.

461
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:43,960
Why are you putting a
tracker on this guy's car?

462
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:45,128
You worry too much.

463
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:46,796
Get in the car.

464
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:51,868
Mm-hmm.

465
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:53,603
So...

466
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:56,005
I told my mom.

467
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,040
And?

468
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:58,474
She cried.

469
00:23:00,478 --> 00:23:03,146
Like, good cried or bad cried?

470
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:07,750
Half "sad I wasn't there" cry

471
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:11,254
and half "happy at least
my daughter is married" cry.

472
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,257
We should fly her up.

473
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,192
When we get our place.

474
00:23:16,227 --> 00:23:17,760
Like, have a little reception?

475
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:20,096
Yeah, just family.

476
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,232
Yeah.

477
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,068
Yeah, for family.

478
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,909
Hey.

479
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:34,544
Hey.

480
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,678
Hi.

481
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,416
So are we nuts?

482
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,491
Maybe.

483
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,340
Hi. You're new here, aren't you?

484
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,576
Oh, I've taken a couple of zumba classes,

485
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,277
but this is my first class here.

486
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,246
Well, the instructor is awesome.

487
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:11,747
You're gonna love it.

488
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,522
All right, ladies!

489
00:24:19,557 --> 00:24:22,525
Who's ready to sweat?

490
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,227
Oh!

491
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,362
Here we go!

492
00:24:26,397 --> 00:24:28,364
Row those arms!

493
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,536
We going this way.

494
00:24:47,561 --> 00:24:51,163
Hey, Tina, can you take over for a second?

495
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:52,531
Miss?

496
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:54,033
New girl!

497
00:24:54,068 --> 00:24:56,535
Can I see you over here for a moment?

498
00:24:56,571 --> 00:24:58,170
There you go, ladies!

499
00:24:58,206 --> 00:24:59,939
- Whoo!
- Make it happen!

500
00:24:59,974 --> 00:25:01,240
- Looking good!
- Yeah!

501
00:25:01,275 --> 00:25:03,042
Who sent you?

502
00:25:03,077 --> 00:25:04,610
- Nobody.
- Who knows?

503
00:25:04,645 --> 00:25:06,265
Nobody.

504
00:25:06,267 --> 00:25:08,334
You mean to tell me that you
just came to a zumba class

505
00:25:08,369 --> 00:25:09,669
in Pilsen on your own?

506
00:25:09,704 --> 00:25:11,103
I live here.

507
00:25:11,139 --> 00:25:13,239
Well, you're just gonna
have to leave, right now.

508
00:25:13,274 --> 00:25:15,541
But this is the best
rated zumba class on Yelp.

509
00:25:15,577 --> 00:25:17,243
How you doing, ladies?

510
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:21,013
Well, what's it gonna take
to keep you quiet about this?

511
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:24,250
- Let me teach you to cook.
- What?

512
00:25:24,285 --> 00:25:26,152
You have a food truck that needs a cook.

513
00:25:26,187 --> 00:25:28,254
I have skills I have nowhere to use.

514
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:29,989
- So...
- So cook for the house.

515
00:25:30,024 --> 00:25:31,224
No, I want to cook when I say.

516
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:32,625
I do not want anyone asking me,

517
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,393
"when's dinner ready?" ever.

518
00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:35,528
But for Molly's II...

519
00:25:35,563 --> 00:25:39,632
Wait, hold on, let me get this straight.

520
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:42,101
In order to keep you from outing me,

521
00:25:42,136 --> 00:25:46,172
I have to allow you to cook for me?

522
00:25:46,207 --> 00:25:48,474
Yes.

523
00:25:48,509 --> 00:25:50,142
You are...

524
00:25:50,178 --> 00:25:52,044
you're like...

525
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,747
like, perfect.

526
00:25:54,782 --> 00:25:56,682
Deal?

527
00:25:56,718 --> 00:25:58,517
Absolutely.

528
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:06,525
All right, ladies!

529
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:08,594
One more time, yeah!

530
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,363
Oh, oh!

531
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:12,565
Here we go again, yeah!

532
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,602
Pass the cheese?

533
00:26:16,638 --> 00:26:19,005
Thanks.

534
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,673
Want some hot sauce?

535
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:21,874
Nah.

536
00:26:23,911 --> 00:26:25,044
There they are.

537
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:26,212
Hey.

538
00:26:26,247 --> 00:26:28,681
- How's it going?
- Good.

539
00:26:30,785 --> 00:26:31,984
Is that all you have?

540
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,619
Yeah, I came straight here with the bags

541
00:26:33,655 --> 00:26:35,021
I packed for Vegas.

542
00:26:35,056 --> 00:26:37,323
I'm gonna get my friends to
send me some more clothes.

543
00:26:37,358 --> 00:26:41,227
Otherwise, I'm gonna be
wearing a lot of bikinis.

544
00:26:44,065 --> 00:26:46,299
- Welcome.
- Thank you so much...

545
00:26:46,334 --> 00:26:48,634
so much for letting me stay here.

546
00:26:53,408 --> 00:26:55,207
Whoa, whoa, whoa, back here.

547
00:27:07,288 --> 00:27:09,755
I'll give them a week and then
tell Severide they got to find...

548
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:11,290
I like her.

549
00:27:11,326 --> 00:27:12,958
What?

550
00:27:12,994 --> 00:27:15,795
When did this happen?

551
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,463
Like you said,

552
00:27:17,498 --> 00:27:19,432
he's happy.

553
00:27:19,467 --> 00:27:22,201
What do I know?

554
00:27:22,236 --> 00:27:24,937
You want a beer?

555
00:27:24,972 --> 00:27:25,971
Sure.

556
00:27:33,748 --> 00:27:38,884
I think... I think part
of me is a little jealous.

557
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,655
I mean, he gets to do what he wants.

558
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:46,859
Meet a girl, get married, put
it all out there for the world.

559
00:27:46,894 --> 00:27:49,862
I just get tired of all the sneaking around

560
00:27:49,897 --> 00:27:52,698
and pretending.

561
00:27:52,734 --> 00:27:55,034
Have you been talking to Severide?

562
00:27:55,069 --> 00:27:57,603
No, why?

563
00:27:57,638 --> 00:27:59,705
Nothing, I just...

564
00:28:02,076 --> 00:28:04,210
I mean, you know I hate it too, right?

565
00:28:04,245 --> 00:28:05,444
I know.

566
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,079
As long as you and I
are both on 81, what...

567
00:28:07,115 --> 00:28:08,314
No, no, this isn't your fault.

568
00:28:08,349 --> 00:28:10,416
It isn't anyone's fault.

569
00:28:13,688 --> 00:28:15,254
It just sucks.

570
00:28:17,258 --> 00:28:18,924
Yeah.

571
00:28:21,562 --> 00:28:23,763
And sometimes I wish we
could just fly off to Vegas

572
00:28:23,798 --> 00:28:26,232
and get the rest of our lives started.

573
00:28:28,403 --> 00:28:31,303
You know I would in a second if I could.

574
00:28:31,339 --> 00:28:33,139
Me too.

575
00:28:47,021 --> 00:28:49,455
So the first thing we need here

576
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:51,791
is your marriage certificate.

577
00:28:51,826 --> 00:28:54,360
Got it right here.

578
00:28:58,032 --> 00:28:59,832
It's got a little margarita spilled on it,

579
00:28:59,867 --> 00:29:01,267
but everything's clear.

580
00:29:01,302 --> 00:29:04,003
Okay, we can make a copy of that.

581
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:08,274
So these two are for
your non-major benefits,

582
00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:09,542
prescriptions and the like.

583
00:29:09,577 --> 00:29:10,810
This one goes to personnel,

584
00:29:10,845 --> 00:29:13,646
and this one goes to the insurance company.

585
00:29:13,681 --> 00:29:17,616
Then these two are life
insurance and pension forms,

586
00:29:17,652 --> 00:29:20,886
and they both go to the
pension benefits department.

587
00:29:20,922 --> 00:29:23,823
Then for major medical...

588
00:29:27,195 --> 00:29:29,295
you know what?

589
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:31,697
Let me get these filed for you.

590
00:29:31,732 --> 00:29:32,998
Really?

591
00:29:33,034 --> 00:29:35,201
Consider it my wedding gift.

592
00:29:35,236 --> 00:29:36,602
Congratulations, Severide.

593
00:29:36,637 --> 00:29:40,773
May you know only happiness
from this day forward.

594
00:29:40,808 --> 00:29:44,477
Hey, how many weeks you
have us down for in the pool?

595
00:29:46,781 --> 00:29:48,080
Three.

596
00:29:48,115 --> 00:29:51,283
We're gonna prove you wrong, Chief.

597
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:52,718
I hope you do.

598
00:29:52,753 --> 00:29:54,286
Thanks, Chief.

599
00:29:58,192 --> 00:29:59,258
Three, huh?

600
00:29:59,293 --> 00:30:01,093
How many did you have?

601
00:30:06,767 --> 00:30:09,068
- Yo.
- Yeah.

602
00:30:09,103 --> 00:30:11,337
Come here for a second.

603
00:30:11,372 --> 00:30:12,505
All right.

604
00:30:15,676 --> 00:30:17,543
Your misunderstanding struck again, man,

605
00:30:17,578 --> 00:30:19,712
and this time it left a note.

606
00:30:22,517 --> 00:30:24,216
"I see you again, and you're dead."

607
00:30:24,252 --> 00:30:25,684
- Mills...
- Yo, this is happening

608
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,520
at the house. If Boden
finds out about this,

609
00:30:27,555 --> 00:30:30,256
- you are gone, and it's...
- I hear you, man, come here.

610
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:34,393
What the hell is it with
you and this guy, man?

611
00:30:34,428 --> 00:30:36,128
His name is Jake Williams.

612
00:30:36,163 --> 00:30:40,232
Okay, he has outstanding warrants
for larceny and assault in Wisconsin.

613
00:30:40,268 --> 00:30:44,069
Okay, if I can tail or track
this guy back across state line,

614
00:30:44,105 --> 00:30:47,339
I can pick him up and clear $2,000.

615
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:49,341
You are messing with
this felon for 2 grand?

616
00:30:49,377 --> 00:30:50,776
You have a daughter, come on.

617
00:30:50,811 --> 00:30:53,112
I have a daughter who
has worked her ass off

618
00:30:53,147 --> 00:30:54,680
to help her team get to finals

619
00:30:54,715 --> 00:30:57,349
and a trip to D.C. that's
gonna cost me $1,500.

620
00:30:57,385 --> 00:30:59,285
I can't let her down.

621
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,255
Hey, better you let her down
than get yourself killed, okay?

622
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:05,424
I'm telling you this face-to-face,

623
00:31:05,459 --> 00:31:06,992
you end this now.

624
00:31:12,767 --> 00:31:16,335
Engine 51, Truck 81, Squad 3, Ambulance 61.

625
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:19,138
House fire, 871 Carver Drive.

626
00:31:32,687 --> 00:31:34,587
You have to get Andrew. Mr. Lewellen.

627
00:31:34,622 --> 00:31:36,255
- Is he the resident?
- Yes.

628
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,257
He lives by himself with his dog, Paco.

629
00:31:38,292 --> 00:31:41,126
I saw him bring Paco out
and then go into the cellar.

630
00:31:41,162 --> 00:31:43,529
- It's right down here.
- Ma'am, ma'am, go back.

631
00:31:50,972 --> 00:31:52,738
We have to find a new entrance.

632
00:31:55,076 --> 00:31:57,309
- Hey, Chief, got a window!
- Go!

633
00:31:57,345 --> 00:31:59,912
Newhouse, Tony, I need ladder and entry!

634
00:31:59,947 --> 00:32:01,246
Come on, hustle.

635
00:32:01,282 --> 00:32:02,681
Help him out!

636
00:32:06,854 --> 00:32:08,320
Come on, hustle!

637
00:32:08,356 --> 00:32:10,055
Newhouse, go through.

638
00:32:18,165 --> 00:32:19,798
Keep it back.

639
00:32:32,413 --> 00:32:33,812
Call out!

640
00:32:37,418 --> 00:32:39,218
Call out!

641
00:32:43,224 --> 00:32:45,190
Hey, chief, I found the resident.

642
00:32:45,226 --> 00:32:47,226
He's pretty badly burned.

643
00:32:47,261 --> 00:32:50,095
Hey, bud!

644
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,115
Oh!

645
00:33:10,151 --> 00:33:13,585
Hey, come on.

646
00:33:13,621 --> 00:33:15,454
All right, I'm sending him up!

647
00:33:40,181 --> 00:33:42,214
Severide?

648
00:33:44,185 --> 00:33:46,819
Everything all right down there?

649
00:33:46,854 --> 00:33:48,787
Negative.

650
00:33:48,823 --> 00:33:51,256
I'm okay, Chief, but we
need to seal this room off.

651
00:33:51,292 --> 00:33:54,059
Why, what'd you find?

652
00:33:54,095 --> 00:33:56,628
Make sure everybody knows

653
00:33:56,664 --> 00:33:58,630
nobody touches anything,

654
00:33:58,666 --> 00:33:59,965
and get the cops here now.

655
00:34:05,324 --> 00:34:06,925
So, what do we got?

656
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,293
This fell out of the guy's hands

657
00:34:08,328 --> 00:34:09,894
when he was being hauled up.

658
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:12,597
I'm pretty sure this is
what he came down to get.

659
00:34:12,632 --> 00:34:15,633
Guy's hand? What guy's hand, homeowner?

660
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:17,068
I don't know if he owned the place,

661
00:34:17,103 --> 00:34:18,636
but I'm pretty sure he owned the box.

662
00:34:18,672 --> 00:34:20,438
Where is he now?

663
00:34:20,473 --> 00:34:22,574
My guess, halfway to Chicago Med.

664
00:34:22,609 --> 00:34:25,410
He was pretty banged up when
they loaded him into the ambo.

665
00:34:25,445 --> 00:34:28,213
Hey, call dispatch, get a
twenty on that ambulance.

666
00:34:28,248 --> 00:34:31,149
I want somebody with that guy
when they roll into Chicago Med.

667
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,693
So you didn't touch
the box or its contents?

668
00:34:41,728 --> 00:34:43,261
No.

669
00:34:43,296 --> 00:34:45,029
Didn't open it?

670
00:34:45,065 --> 00:34:46,965
Pretty hard to do without touching it.

671
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,302
We just have to ask these questions
for chain of evidence, Kelly.

672
00:34:51,338 --> 00:34:53,638
I didn't open the box.

673
00:34:59,279 --> 00:35:01,546
Those kids look pretty young.

674
00:35:10,557 --> 00:35:11,656
Hmm.

675
00:35:11,691 --> 00:35:13,191
Oh, God.

676
00:35:21,568 --> 00:35:23,034
Hey, Lieutenant.

677
00:35:23,069 --> 00:35:25,436
You don't work for me anymore, Mills.

678
00:35:25,472 --> 00:35:26,838
Hey, Matt.

679
00:35:26,873 --> 00:35:29,207
There you go. What's up?

680
00:35:29,242 --> 00:35:32,010
We need to help out Newhouse.

681
00:35:42,589 --> 00:35:44,656
What is that?

682
00:35:44,691 --> 00:35:46,591
That is oven-fried ravioli

683
00:35:46,626 --> 00:35:50,228
with crispy sage and pancetta.

684
00:35:50,263 --> 00:35:51,562
You made those?

685
00:35:51,598 --> 00:35:54,265
Hell, no, Brett did,
but she's showing me how,

686
00:35:54,301 --> 00:35:57,568
and it's a perfect
Molly's II signature dish.

687
00:35:57,604 --> 00:36:00,939
Portable, delicious.
It's a lot like bar food.

688
00:36:00,974 --> 00:36:03,775
But with a sophistication all its own.

689
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:06,644
It doesn't smell half
bad, I'll give you that.

690
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,646
And Brett's got these
things down to a science.

691
00:36:08,682 --> 00:36:12,550
We can knock these out in the
truck to order, no problem.

692
00:36:12,585 --> 00:36:14,485
Okay.

693
00:36:14,521 --> 00:36:16,287
I'm going in.

694
00:36:32,472 --> 00:36:34,739
Ladies and gentlemen,

695
00:36:34,774 --> 00:36:37,809
we have a new house chef!

696
00:36:38,845 --> 00:36:40,411
Wait, what?

697
00:36:40,447 --> 00:36:42,914
You think we're gonna eat the
swill these chuckleheads make

698
00:36:42,949 --> 00:36:44,682
when we have someone
who can cook like this?

699
00:36:44,718 --> 00:36:46,517
- Yeah.
- All right.

700
00:36:46,553 --> 00:36:48,353
Brett, when's dinner?

701
00:36:48,388 --> 00:36:50,855
Oh, uh...

702
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:52,957
You know, guys,

703
00:36:52,993 --> 00:36:55,226
we don't use the fine china every day.

704
00:36:55,261 --> 00:36:56,694
We would if it tasted like this.

705
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:00,198
We need to keep Brett's
genius focused on Molly's II.

706
00:37:00,233 --> 00:37:02,133
What's wrong with you?

707
00:37:02,168 --> 00:37:04,235
Just trust me on this one.

708
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:07,372
Yeah, okay, Brett.

709
00:37:07,407 --> 00:37:09,207
No chow duty for you.

710
00:37:14,347 --> 00:37:16,214
Put some money on here!

711
00:37:16,249 --> 00:37:18,049
Give me your credit card.

712
00:37:18,084 --> 00:37:19,217
Yeah, you.

713
00:37:19,252 --> 00:37:20,852
Newhouse!

714
00:37:20,887 --> 00:37:22,353
- Hey, you came!
- Hey!

715
00:37:22,389 --> 00:37:23,521
Come here.

716
00:37:23,556 --> 00:37:25,990
Tell Naomi to have a great time in D.C.

717
00:37:26,026 --> 00:37:27,825
What's this?

718
00:37:27,861 --> 00:37:29,827
We passed the boot.

719
00:37:29,863 --> 00:37:31,262
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

720
00:37:31,297 --> 00:37:32,497
Well, it was either that

721
00:37:32,532 --> 00:37:35,266
or have the guys eat 500 candy bars.

722
00:37:35,301 --> 00:37:38,102
This seemed like the better plan.

723
00:37:38,138 --> 00:37:39,771
Wow.

724
00:37:39,806 --> 00:37:42,040
Mills, this your doing?

725
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,180
God.

726
00:37:49,215 --> 00:37:51,215
I don't know what to say.

727
00:37:56,556 --> 00:37:58,189
Thank you, all of you.

728
00:37:58,224 --> 00:38:00,091
Hey, we're 51.

729
00:38:00,126 --> 00:38:02,794
We take care of our family, man.

730
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:04,829
51.

731
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,204
Sorry.

732
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:15,239
It just hits me sometimes.

733
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:20,111
I know.

734
00:38:20,146 --> 00:38:22,013
Me, too.

735
00:38:29,355 --> 00:38:31,222
You saved my life, you know that?

736
00:38:34,894 --> 00:38:36,527
We saved each other.

737
00:38:47,307 --> 00:38:48,706
Come on, let's go home.

738
00:38:48,741 --> 00:38:52,210
No, no, your friends threw a party for us.

739
00:38:52,245 --> 00:38:53,811
- Let's go inside.
- You don't have to.

740
00:38:53,847 --> 00:38:55,513
- You don't have to.
- I want to.

741
00:39:00,086 --> 00:39:01,419
You sure?

742
00:39:01,454 --> 00:39:03,054
Sure I want to celebrate marrying you?

743
00:39:03,089 --> 00:39:06,257
Yeah, yeah, so badly it's not even funny.

744
00:39:11,531 --> 00:39:14,132
This is grim.

745
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:15,233
Yeah.

746
00:39:17,804 --> 00:39:21,506
So the federal kiddie porn databases,

747
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:24,342
they search for the kid
and for the background

748
00:39:24,377 --> 00:39:27,578
so that they can identify the
work of different offenders,

749
00:39:27,614 --> 00:39:29,580
so I figured we'd do the same thing.

750
00:39:33,987 --> 00:39:35,820
Oh, my God.

751
00:39:35,855 --> 00:39:37,188
What?

752
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,293
Oh, my God.

753
00:39:42,328 --> 00:39:44,328
My God.

754
00:39:53,506 --> 00:39:55,673
When's the last time you heard from him?

755
00:39:58,044 --> 00:39:59,810
Ten years?

756
00:40:01,814 --> 00:40:03,648
You know how old he is in that photo?

757
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,888
I mean, 15, maybe.

758
00:40:14,227 --> 00:40:16,861
He took off for New
York not long after that.

759
00:40:18,932 --> 00:40:21,666
Come here, come here.

760
00:40:28,808 --> 00:40:31,576
We'll send that off to Manhattan SVU.

761
00:40:31,611 --> 00:40:32,810
Yeah.

762
00:40:32,845 --> 00:40:34,645
We'll see if they have anything on him.

763
00:40:34,681 --> 00:40:37,281
Yeah, mm-hmm.

764
00:40:43,056 --> 00:40:45,389
- Rollins.
- Did you get the files I sent?

765
00:40:45,425 --> 00:40:48,326
Um, yeah, thank you.

766
00:40:48,361 --> 00:40:49,760
Did I hear right?

767
00:40:49,796 --> 00:40:52,196
You've got history with one
of the vics in the photos,

768
00:40:52,232 --> 00:40:54,465
um, a Ted Courtney?

769
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,901
Yeah...

770
00:40:58,805 --> 00:41:00,238
He's my brother.

771
00:41:04,844 --> 00:41:07,678
Erin, I'm sorry.

772
00:41:07,714 --> 00:41:09,347
It's okay.

773
00:41:09,382 --> 00:41:11,549
No, it's...

774
00:41:11,584 --> 00:41:14,252
it's not.

775
00:41:14,287 --> 00:41:17,255
Well, listen, we got
database hits on a couple

776
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:20,424
of the other vics in the
photos, all New York missings.

777
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,730
I don't know how your
brother got mixed up in this,

778
00:41:25,765 --> 00:41:28,366
but we're gonna get to
the bottom of it, okay?

779
00:41:28,401 --> 00:41:31,469
Listen, I'd like to come and help out.

780
00:41:31,504 --> 00:41:33,170
I've already cleared it with my boss,

781
00:41:33,206 --> 00:41:36,140
so if it's all right with you...

782
00:41:36,175 --> 00:41:38,476
I guess we'll be seeing you soon.

783
00:41:38,511 --> 00:41:40,011
All right.

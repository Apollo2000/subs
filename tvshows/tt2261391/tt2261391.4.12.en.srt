Synthetic drug.

It ain't illegal to sell.

So, uh... you're
closing the shelter?

402
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,929
Yeah, unfortunately, the tornado

403
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,430
fell below the threshold
of a national disaster,

404
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,469
so federal relief funds
are scarce.

405
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,969
Mostly, it falls
on the local charities,

406
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,109
which are cash-strapped
on the best of days.

407
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,709
What's being done about it?

408
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,709
Well, I'm here
putting together a fundraiser

409
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,619
for the victims of our ward.

410
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,080
Having a first responder
there, especially an officer,

411
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:45,089
would do wonders
for raising visibility

412
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,790
and possibly
some additional cash.

413
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,459
I'm not really one

how I can help.

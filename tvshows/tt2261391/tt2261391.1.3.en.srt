1
00:00:01,487 --> 00:00:03,663
I need a trauma surgeon
for a possible amputation.

2
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:04,793
How long on the surgeon?

3
00:00:04,814 --> 00:00:05,751
We need to pull back.

4
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:06,766
It's gonna give.

5
00:00:10,545 --> 00:00:11,938
<i>Previously on Chicago fire...</i>

6
00:00:11,998 --> 00:00:13,757
Yeah.

7
00:00:13,937 --> 00:00:14,794
Glad you're back, Herrmann.

8
00:00:14,954 --> 00:00:16,292
We're a better house with you here.

9
00:00:16,334 --> 00:00:17,234
Thanks, chief.

10
00:00:17,345 --> 00:00:18,787
This is Nicki Rutkowski.

11
00:00:18,921 --> 00:00:19,642
Hello.

12
00:00:19,842 --> 00:00:21,503
She's gonna be working
with us the next month.

13
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,214
Her father is one of my oldest friends.

14
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:28,455
- Hey.
- Hey.

15
00:00:28,456 --> 00:00:30,009
Do you maybe wanna hook up for a beer?

16
00:00:30,142 --> 00:00:31,638
- Peter Mills, are you gay?
- Me? No.

17
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,122
Because I am.

18
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:35,509
Did you hear about hallie and Casey?

19
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:36,760
What?

20
00:00:36,762 --> 00:00:39,846
That maybe they're splitting up.

21
00:00:39,848 --> 00:00:42,349
I've been thinking.

22
00:00:42,351 --> 00:00:44,868
What if we simplify things?

23
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,486
Start fresh.

24
00:00:46,488 --> 00:00:48,271
Put it all aside...

25
00:00:48,273 --> 00:00:50,073
Live every day like it could be the last.

26
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,498
- Hey.
- Hey.

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,817
I need something.

28
00:01:00,819 --> 00:01:02,252
It's the last one.

29
00:01:02,254 --> 00:01:04,170
- Yeah.
- I mean it.

30
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,021
What the hell just happened?

31
00:01:23,858 --> 00:01:25,976
Damn thing's fried.

32
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:28,678
Two hours left in the shift
and no calls yet.

33
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,350
That happen very often?

34
00:01:33,352 --> 00:01:36,570
He did not just say that.

35
00:01:38,407 --> 00:01:41,041
Accident, truck 81, squad 3.

36
00:01:51,536 --> 00:01:53,386
Mills.

37
00:01:53,388 --> 00:01:56,089
Pitcher's got a no-hitter
going in the eighth inning.

38
00:01:56,091 --> 00:01:57,807
Do you go up to him and say,

39
00:01:57,809 --> 00:01:59,542
"looks like you got
a no-hitter going"?

40
00:01:59,544 --> 00:02:01,044
No, but...

41
00:02:01,046 --> 00:02:02,762
don't do it at the damn firehouse either.

42
00:02:02,764 --> 00:02:07,383
Yeah, I got it.

43
00:02:20,031 --> 00:02:23,533
Stabilize the van!

44
00:02:23,535 --> 00:02:25,251
It's jammed.

45
00:02:28,589 --> 00:02:30,473
Anybody got ejected?

46
00:02:30,475 --> 00:02:32,008
Vargas, see if we got a pulse over there!

47
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,610
Got one here!

48
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,982
I'm okay. I'm all right.

49
00:02:38,984 --> 00:02:41,368
Field test this idiot.

50
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,205
Open containers right there.

51
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,489
I'll take care of it.

52
00:02:46,491 --> 00:02:49,376
She's going!
She's going!

53
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,411
What happened?

54
00:02:55,499 --> 00:02:58,418
Stabilizers!

55
00:02:59,503 --> 00:03:02,172
Cribbing!

56
00:03:06,677 --> 00:03:08,711
Let's go.

57
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:17,053
Give us ten more seconds, boys.

58
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:18,588
You got eight.

59
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,473
Hey, sir, just sit tight
there for me, all right?

60
00:03:20,475 --> 00:03:21,758
Don't try and unbuckle yourself.

61
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,610
Is he all right?
My son?

62
00:03:23,612 --> 00:03:25,478
He's not saying anything.

63
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,814
- Yeah, he's alive, sir.
- Thank God.

64
00:03:27,816 --> 00:03:28,982
We're gonna need a second ambo.

65
00:03:28,984 --> 00:03:30,233
Two more!

66
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:31,651
Driver of the first car over there.

67
00:03:31,653 --> 00:03:32,786
I need two back boards.

68
00:03:32,788 --> 00:03:34,771
Where's those jaws?

69
00:03:36,106 --> 00:03:37,824
Unh!

70
00:03:44,331 --> 00:03:46,416
- Too tight?
- Yeah!

71
00:03:46,418 --> 00:03:48,168
We're gonna go through the windshield.

72
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,920
And get me a pick head.
Coming up.

73
00:03:52,623 --> 00:03:54,057
What happened?

74
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:56,476
You're gonna be okay, buddy.
Hockey fan,

75
00:03:56,478 --> 00:03:58,645
We were headed to Evanston
for his tournament.

76
00:03:58,647 --> 00:04:01,181
Are you okay, Mikey?
Yeah, I think so.

77
00:04:01,183 --> 00:04:02,965
What happened?

78
00:04:20,984 --> 00:04:23,870
Vehicle stabilized.

79
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:25,955
I'll be right back.

80
00:04:25,957 --> 00:04:27,590
Sir, you're coming out first, all right?

81
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,664
Where's the driver?

82
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,966
Some officers took him to the hospital.

83
00:04:36,968 --> 00:04:38,551
You're kidding me.

84
00:04:38,553 --> 00:04:40,336
No, he was complaining of leg pain,

85
00:04:40,338 --> 00:04:42,222
and you guys looked swamped
over there, so...

86
00:04:42,224 --> 00:04:43,556
he should've been c-collared

87
00:04:43,558 --> 00:04:45,692
and transported properly.

88
00:04:45,694 --> 00:04:47,444
My bad.

89
00:04:51,115 --> 00:04:53,199
Did you bag the beer cans?

90
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:55,535
Look.

91
00:04:55,537 --> 00:04:58,955
Detective Voight... behind me,
the guy in the jacket...

92
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:05,528
that was his son driving this car.

94
00:05:33,843 --> 00:05:34,986
hey. You want some coffee?

95
00:05:35,178 --> 00:05:37,294
No, I'm gonna go hit the gym.
I'll see you at the firehouse.

96
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:38,796
All right.
How's your arm?

97
00:05:38,798 --> 00:05:41,382
It's good.

98
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:43,351
- It's fine.
- All right.

99
00:05:43,353 --> 00:05:45,169
Well, you should get it
looked at, you know, Kelly?

100
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:47,605
It could act up at the wrong time.

101
00:05:47,607 --> 00:05:50,691
No, absolutely.
I'm...

102
00:05:50,693 --> 00:05:53,527
I'm planning on doing that.
All right, I'll see you later.

103
00:05:55,464 --> 00:05:57,615
Bye.

104
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,683
Here we go.

105
00:06:02,037 --> 00:06:03,821
Dude, I'm sorry.

106
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:07,975
But I ordered crispy bacon
and, this... Ain't crispy.

107
00:06:07,977 --> 00:06:10,077
Where's the hot waitress?

108
00:06:12,864 --> 00:06:14,749
I mean, you're cute and everything.

109
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:22,590
I'll be right back
with your bacon... Sir.

110
00:06:34,385 --> 00:06:36,237
Elise, I can't wait for mom.
I gotta go.

111
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:38,072
Then go!

112
00:06:38,074 --> 00:06:40,107
Table eight.

113
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:42,159
- Where you going?
- To work, mom.

114
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:43,327
My real job.

115
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:44,829
Samantha just called in sick.

116
00:06:44,831 --> 00:06:47,581
Mom, I'll cover it.
We'll be fine.

117
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,201
You can switch shifts
with somebody at the firehouse.

118
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:52,119
Mom! I'm a candidate.

119
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:55,456
You know that
they can bounce me like that.

120
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,124
I have to go.

121
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:58,759
Fine. Go.

122
00:07:20,431 --> 00:07:21,982
You're late!

123
00:07:29,075 --> 00:07:32,209
Good afternoon, candidate.

124
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:33,911
- Sorry.
- First he blows a no-hitter.

125
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:35,612
Now he's coming in five minutes late.

126
00:07:35,614 --> 00:07:37,248
So much for employee of the week.

127
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,251
It won't happen again.
I promise.

128
00:07:40,253 --> 00:07:42,286
Get changed out.
Let's go.

129
00:07:49,227 --> 00:07:51,645
You know, you were the candidate

130
00:07:51,647 --> 00:07:53,264
up until two weeks ago.

131
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:54,648
Why are you riding him so hard?

132
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,934
The abused abuse...

133
00:07:56,936 --> 00:07:58,486
Cruz.

134
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:03,307
Good morning.

135
00:08:03,309 --> 00:08:04,992
Uhoh.

136
00:08:04,994 --> 00:08:07,578
We're either in trouble
or he wants something.

137
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,146
You got a sec?

138
00:08:09,148 --> 00:08:10,948
Later.

139
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,483
What's up?

140
00:08:13,485 --> 00:08:15,503
Is your brother still working in vice?

141
00:08:15,505 --> 00:08:16,987
Yeah.

142
00:08:16,989 --> 00:08:19,156
Could you see if he can
swing by here real quick?

143
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:21,592
Sure.

144
00:08:21,594 --> 00:08:23,460
All your hookers get locked up last night?

145
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:25,546
Yeah.
My whole stable.

146
00:08:26,682 --> 00:08:29,099
I just got a question for him.

147
00:08:29,101 --> 00:08:30,134
Yeah.
I'll give him a call.

148
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:32,219
- Okay.
- Everything all right?

149
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:33,971
Yeah, yeah.

150
00:08:37,108 --> 00:08:38,976
Okay.

151
00:08:46,851 --> 00:08:48,369
- Hey, lieutenant.
- Hey.

152
00:08:48,371 --> 00:08:50,821
Wanted to let you know
that I just completed

153
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:52,156
the last of my tech course

154
00:08:52,158 --> 00:08:54,291
and I reached my squad certification.

155
00:08:54,293 --> 00:08:55,993
That's great.
Good job.

156
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:57,711
Yeah, three years busting my hump,

157
00:08:57,713 --> 00:08:59,413
but I got it done.

158
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:01,665
So I'm putting in a transfer from truck

159
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,367
and I wanted to get your blessing.

160
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,055
Why do you wanna come over to squad?

161
00:09:09,558 --> 00:09:11,425
With where I wanna end up,
squad's the best place

162
00:09:11,427 --> 00:09:13,394
in terms of a stepping stone
to getting promoted.

163
00:09:13,396 --> 00:09:15,145
Let me stop you right there, vargas.

164
00:09:15,147 --> 00:09:16,513
If that's your reason for coming over...

165
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:19,549
It ain't!
That came out wrong.

166
00:09:19,551 --> 00:09:22,102
The promotion stuff, that's down the road.

167
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:23,771
It's way down the road.

168
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:25,656
Absolutely.

169
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,081
That ain't gonna cut it.

170
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,416
Sign's out front.

171
00:09:35,418 --> 00:09:38,252
Just a matter of time
till a good samaritan steps up.

172
00:09:38,254 --> 00:09:40,287
- We can do that?
- Yeah.

173
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:43,407
It's frowned upon, but it's not illegal

174
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:44,925
per standards and procedures.

175
00:09:44,927 --> 00:09:48,078
Last year, we got the new...
what was it?

176
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,129
Microwave.

177
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:51,048
Got the new microwave by doing this.

178
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,749
It took three months
to get the new microwave.

179
00:09:52,751 --> 00:09:53,934
The bears game is this Sunday.

180
00:09:53,936 --> 00:09:55,302
What we got in the treasury box?

181
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:56,437
Dick.

182
00:09:56,439 --> 00:09:58,588
We spent it all on the elliptical machine

183
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,257
so shay could keep her ass toned.

184
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:01,809
Herrmann, please.

185
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:05,613
Everyone benefits
from me having a toned ass.

186
00:10:05,615 --> 00:10:08,899
Mills, you're in charge
of a fundraiser for a new TV.

187
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:10,651
Instead of cooking?

188
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:12,820
In conjunction with cooking.

189
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:14,955
I believe it's called multitasking.

190
00:10:14,957 --> 00:10:17,992
And get some ideas together asap.

191
00:10:17,994 --> 00:10:19,443
Casey.

192
00:10:23,114 --> 00:10:24,281
- He in?
- On the phone.

193
00:10:24,283 --> 00:10:28,252
You can leave it with me, though.

194
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:29,753
Hey,

195
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:32,222
Tomorrow night,
I don't know if you have plans,

196
00:10:32,224 --> 00:10:33,757
but me and some girlfriends

197
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,092
are going to see Kaskade at the Vic

198
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:36,260
if you're interested.

199
00:10:36,262 --> 00:10:37,794
What's Kaskade?

200
00:10:37,796 --> 00:10:41,298
He's a dj.

201
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,319
- Famous one.
- Yeah,

202
00:10:46,905 --> 00:10:49,806
Look, I'm not really
known for my self-restraint.

203
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:51,859
So I'll need you to meet me halfway here

204
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:54,028
and respect Boden and your dad's wishes.

205
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,287
Who wants to be known as the rat fireman

206
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:04,988
who took down a cop's kid?

207
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,491
- What's the cop's name?
- Detective Voight.

208
00:11:07,493 --> 00:11:11,161
- Aye yi.
- What's the problem?

209
00:11:11,163 --> 00:11:14,381
Voight's been hip-deep
in the gang unit for 15 years.

210
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:17,334
He's been investigated for taking bribes.

211
00:11:17,336 --> 00:11:20,504
Look, he's a dirty cop.

212
00:11:20,506 --> 00:11:22,189
The kind of guy that gives
the rest of us a bad name.

213
00:11:22,191 --> 00:11:25,225
Okay.

214
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:28,779
Well, I saw what I saw.
The question is...

215
00:11:28,781 --> 00:11:29,846
Did anyone else see it?

216
00:11:29,848 --> 00:11:31,899
I'll ask around.

217
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:34,368
Put some feelers out.
Wait to hear from me.

218
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,320
'Cause I'm telling you
as a friend of my sister's,

219
00:11:36,322 --> 00:11:38,188
you do not want to mess with this dude.

220
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,990
Lieutenant Casey!

221
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:41,709
Chief wants to see you in his office.

222
00:11:41,711 --> 00:11:45,129
Okay. Whatever you can do,
I'd appreciate it.

223
00:11:54,055 --> 00:11:57,541
How long you been dating this guy?

224
00:11:57,543 --> 00:11:59,676
What... Antonio, what are you...

225
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:00,677
Where do you come up with this stuff?

226
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,730
You're trippin'.

227
00:12:02,732 --> 00:12:06,016
I'm not... I'm...

228
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:07,735
He's taken.

229
00:12:07,737 --> 00:12:09,937
So...

230
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:11,721
All right.

231
00:12:11,723 --> 00:12:12,906
Well, I'll be in touch.

232
00:12:12,908 --> 00:12:14,108
Hey, you being straight with him?

233
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,193
If anything, I downplayed it.

234
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:18,112
Your boy's messing
with a stick of dynamite.

235
00:12:18,114 --> 00:12:20,614
Then do your job and help him out.

236
00:12:23,918 --> 00:12:27,287
Incident report
from that t-bone last shift.

237
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,289
I got Severide's.
Where's yours?

238
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,925
Right, I've been buried
in paperwork, and...

239
00:12:31,927 --> 00:12:36,513
on my desk by the end of this shift.

240
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,189
That gonna be a problem?

241
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:46,774
Not at all.

242
00:12:57,315 --> 00:12:58,938
A neighbourhood hotdog eating contest.

243
00:12:59,182 --> 00:13:01,133
Too tacky.

244
00:13:01,135 --> 00:13:03,185
And putting a sign out front
begging for a TV is what?

245
00:13:03,187 --> 00:13:04,353
- He's got a point.
- Okay,

246
00:13:04,355 --> 00:13:06,471
How about a tee shirt booth
in the driveway?

247
00:13:06,473 --> 00:13:08,190
We already sell tee shirts.

248
00:13:08,192 --> 00:13:09,324
Yeah, but I mean,

249
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:10,859
no one can ever
find the key to the cabinet,

250
00:13:10,861 --> 00:13:13,996
Herrmann never has change
in the treasury box.

251
00:13:13,998 --> 00:13:17,749
It's a pain in the ass,
so we put the shirts out front

252
00:13:17,751 --> 00:13:19,501
and display 'em properly.

253
00:13:19,503 --> 00:13:21,837
I don't know how that's
gonna generate enough money...

254
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,372
and we get Nicki to man the booth.

255
00:13:23,374 --> 00:13:25,707
Ding. Done.

256
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:28,994
That is called putting it over
the goal line, Peter Mills.

257
00:13:28,996 --> 00:13:33,331
Why don't you put her
in a bikini while you're at it?

258
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,500
Before I respond, are you
joking, or are you serious?

259
00:13:35,502 --> 00:13:38,170
About as serious
as putting you in a bikini.

260
00:13:38,172 --> 00:13:39,688
That's what I thought.

261
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,974
So yes, a bikini would be ridiculous.

262
00:13:41,976 --> 00:13:43,508
And we get the joke.

263
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,528
Hey, what do you
think, Casey, tee shirt stand?

264
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,981
Or should we have Mills here
run a few laps around the block,

265
00:13:48,983 --> 00:13:53,235
think about some alternatives?

266
00:13:53,237 --> 00:13:56,205
Everybody on the floor.
Gonna do a drill.

267
00:14:01,194 --> 00:14:02,961
Mills, listen up.

268
00:14:02,963 --> 00:14:05,697
This is a downed firefighter assessment.

269
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:07,749
Fellow firefighter's
gonna be on the floor,

270
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:09,551
full gear with his pass alarm going off.

271
00:14:09,553 --> 00:14:11,203
You crawl in from 10 feet away,

272
00:14:11,205 --> 00:14:13,422
deactivate his alarm, check for air flow,

273
00:14:13,424 --> 00:14:15,090
call in a mayday on your radio,

274
00:14:15,092 --> 00:14:17,226
and drag the victim
to the extraction point,

275
00:14:17,228 --> 00:14:20,229
which will be the north gate.

276
00:14:20,231 --> 00:14:22,214
Okay.

277
00:14:22,216 --> 00:14:23,849
But with a blacked-out
face mask

278
00:14:23,851 --> 00:14:25,383
to simulate zero visibility.

279
00:14:25,385 --> 00:14:27,519
Okay.

280
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:29,905
No showing up late to this one, candidate.

281
00:14:29,907 --> 00:14:31,740
Eh?

282
00:14:31,742 --> 00:14:35,060
I got two masks.

283
00:14:36,229 --> 00:14:39,281
Slowest time has to mop
the apparatus floor.

284
00:14:39,283 --> 00:14:40,282
Time him.

285
00:14:40,284 --> 00:14:41,733
Let's go, gentlemen.
Gear up.

286
00:14:41,735 --> 00:14:44,620
Hey, Hal.
What's going on?

287
00:14:44,622 --> 00:14:47,172
Lunch break.

288
00:14:47,174 --> 00:14:48,290
You eaten yet?

289
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:52,761
No. Come on.

290
00:14:52,763 --> 00:14:54,429
- Hey, gabriela.
- Hey, hallie.

291
00:14:54,431 --> 00:14:57,182
- Good seeing you.
- You too.

292
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,222
Hey, this came in for you earlier.

293
00:15:03,224 --> 00:15:05,774
Thanks.

294
00:15:19,155 --> 00:15:22,607
You look pleased with yourself.

295
00:15:22,609 --> 00:15:25,661
Downed firefighter
assessment. New house record.

296
00:15:25,663 --> 00:15:28,213
Yeah?
How's Otis taking it?

297
00:15:28,215 --> 00:15:29,447
I don't know.

298
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:32,784
But the floor was looking
pretty dirty, so...

299
00:15:32,786 --> 00:15:35,504
Is that a little cockiness
I sense there, Peter Mills?

300
00:15:35,506 --> 00:15:37,639
It ain't being cocky
if you can back it up.

301
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:39,725
Really?

302
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:43,228
Well, a lot of candidates with
skills get their day in the sun,

303
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,765
but how they handle themselves
the other 364...

304
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:48,350
that's what keeps them around.

305
00:15:48,352 --> 00:15:51,737
I will take that under advisement.

306
00:15:59,862 --> 00:16:02,480
What happened to
the passengers in the other car?

307
00:16:02,482 --> 00:16:03,949
I don't know.

308
00:16:03,951 --> 00:16:07,369
They were alert when we got 'em
backboarded and into the ambos.

309
00:16:07,371 --> 00:16:11,823
It was a dad and his son.

310
00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:12,991
What was the last name?

311
00:16:12,993 --> 00:16:17,713
Duffy.

312
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:19,431
The son's 16?

313
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:20,999
On his way to a hockey tournament?

314
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:23,135
Yeah.

315
00:16:23,137 --> 00:16:25,837
You heard something?

316
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:26,838
Baby...

317
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,557
What? Just...

318
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:31,310
Tell me.

319
00:16:31,312 --> 00:16:33,312
It's a complete l2 fracture.

320
00:16:33,314 --> 00:16:36,514
He's paralyzed, waist down.

321
00:16:42,905 --> 00:16:44,523
We just got a TV donated.

322
00:16:44,525 --> 00:16:46,908
Flat screen, still in the box.

323
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,878
Cop over at the 35th precinct donated it.

324
00:16:52,165 --> 00:16:54,166
- Beautiful!
- Yeah!

325
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:57,035
- Whoo!
- Yeah, baby!

326
00:16:57,037 --> 00:16:58,170
Whoo.

327
00:16:58,172 --> 00:16:59,838
Beautiful!

328
00:17:01,508 --> 00:17:03,708
- Yeah!
- Who's it from?

329
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,595
Detective Voight.
He saw your sign.

330
00:17:06,597 --> 00:17:08,230
- Is that a 40-inch?
- A 43!

331
00:17:08,232 --> 00:17:10,015
God damn.

332
00:17:10,017 --> 00:17:11,383
Whoo!

333
00:17:11,385 --> 00:17:14,186
Take it back.

334
00:17:14,188 --> 00:17:15,720
No, no, no.

335
00:17:15,722 --> 00:17:18,056
Don't worry. Voight went
through all the channels.

336
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:19,557
Said to donate it to the city,
but specified it come here.

337
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,893
So the bureau bitches
aren't gonna freak out.

338
00:17:21,895 --> 00:17:24,830
Send it back.

339
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:33,071
Sure. You got it.

340
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:42,130
Is that something that you
need to bring me in on?

341
00:17:42,132 --> 00:17:45,183
Yeah.

342
00:18:04,904 --> 00:18:07,622
Evites are so impersonal.

343
00:18:12,662 --> 00:18:14,079
Leave it on.

344
00:18:14,081 --> 00:18:17,132
Girl, you are barking up the wrong tree.

345
00:18:17,134 --> 00:18:19,468
Yeah? Prove it.

346
00:18:27,177 --> 00:18:29,461
Jumper, squad 3,

347
00:18:29,463 --> 00:18:31,730
truck 81, ambulance 61.

348
00:18:34,968 --> 00:18:36,485
Still alive?

349
00:18:36,487 --> 00:18:37,486
Yeah, but if he wanted to be dead before,

350
00:18:37,488 --> 00:18:38,603
I guarantee he wants it now.

351
00:18:38,605 --> 00:18:40,989
- How high?
- Fourth floor.

352
00:18:40,991 --> 00:18:42,357
I'll call ahead to St. Mary's.

353
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:44,642
Have 'em prep for spinal trauma,
multiple broken bones.

354
00:18:44,644 --> 00:18:48,914
It's not like that.

355
00:18:55,988 --> 00:18:57,155
Holy smokes.

356
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,900
We got a pulse.

357
00:19:10,902 --> 00:19:12,585
We need two ladders and a rope bag.

358
00:19:12,587 --> 00:19:14,787
You pull him off, he bleeds
out right here, right now.

359
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:17,957
Chief?

360
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:21,260
Get the k-12.
We're cutting him down.

361
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:37,310
Pump some water on that steel
so it doesn't overheat!

362
00:19:37,312 --> 00:19:38,594
He's gonna arrest.

363
00:19:38,596 --> 00:19:40,563
Talk to the saw, not me.

364
00:19:40,565 --> 00:19:41,781
You'll be all right,
just try and stand still!

365
00:19:41,783 --> 00:19:44,066
He can't hear you!
He's in shock!

366
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:52,608
Hold that.

367
00:19:54,795 --> 00:19:57,246
All right, get ready.
He's coming down.

368
00:19:57,248 --> 00:19:59,582
Three, two, one.

369
00:19:59,584 --> 00:20:00,633
Everybody good?

370
00:20:00,635 --> 00:20:01,784
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

371
00:20:01,786 --> 00:20:03,219
- Watch this.
- Got it, got it, got it.

372
00:20:06,924 --> 00:20:08,508
Hey, whoa.

373
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,143
He's going into v-fib.
We gotta pull the fence.

374
00:20:10,145 --> 00:20:11,844
What happened to "we pull it he dies"?

375
00:20:11,846 --> 00:20:12,962
We gotta get his heart back on rhythm,

376
00:20:12,964 --> 00:20:14,013
but there's no way I'm shocking him

377
00:20:14,015 --> 00:20:15,014
till we get this iron out first.

378
00:20:15,016 --> 00:20:17,183
- Severide.
- Yo.

379
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:21,487
Unh!

380
00:20:31,865 --> 00:20:32,999
Pull it away.

381
00:20:33,001 --> 00:20:36,318
Go.

382
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:40,823
All right, hit it!

383
00:20:40,825 --> 00:20:42,375
On me.

384
00:20:42,377 --> 00:20:45,378
Ready, pull!

385
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,129
One, two, three!

386
00:20:49,384 --> 00:20:51,634
Pull him out for me.

387
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:55,221
Okay, here we go.

388
00:20:55,223 --> 00:20:56,355
Shocking at two, stand by.

389
00:20:56,357 --> 00:20:59,725
Clear.

390
00:20:59,727 --> 00:21:01,694
Hitting him again at 360.
Stand by.

391
00:21:01,696 --> 00:21:05,031
Clear.

392
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:06,532
Rhythm.

393
00:21:06,534 --> 00:21:08,684
He's got a pulse.
Okay, get him in!

394
00:21:08,686 --> 00:21:10,987
40year-old male,
suicide attempt.

395
00:21:10,989 --> 00:21:12,872
Fell from four stories,
impaled on a fence.

396
00:21:12,874 --> 00:21:14,490
You removed it on scene?

397
00:21:14,492 --> 00:21:16,576
He went into v-fib.
I had to yank.

398
00:21:16,578 --> 00:21:17,577
Two shocks on the monitor
brought him back.

399
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:20,195
Let's get him into one.

400
00:21:26,887 --> 00:21:29,472
I'll be right back.

401
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,510
Kendra.

402
00:21:34,512 --> 00:21:37,179
- Hey, you.
- Hi.

403
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:40,566
Missed you on Saturday.

404
00:21:40,568 --> 00:21:42,551
Yeah, I was working.
How was it?

405
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:44,904
The food was good.

406
00:21:44,906 --> 00:21:46,739
But I don't know why Kim's
still with Kristin.

407
00:21:46,741 --> 00:21:48,157
All they do is pick at each other.

408
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,742
I mean, enough already, you know?

409
00:21:49,744 --> 00:21:52,411
Yeah. Believe me.

410
00:21:52,413 --> 00:21:54,413
Listen...

411
00:21:54,415 --> 00:21:56,398
I need a big favor.

412
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:14,917
You got any ibuprofen?

413
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:17,136
Yes, indeedy.
How many you want?

414
00:22:17,138 --> 00:22:18,137
Five.

415
00:22:18,139 --> 00:22:20,690
Here's two.

416
00:22:27,064 --> 00:22:29,932
Seriously. Too many can do
serious damage to your kidneys.

417
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:33,953
Okay?

418
00:22:33,955 --> 00:22:35,454
Don't come running to me

419
00:22:35,456 --> 00:22:36,789
when you're on dialysis
in five years, okay?

420
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:38,824
Thanks.

421
00:22:38,826 --> 00:22:42,295
Seriously, look it up.
Ibuprofen and kidneys.

422
00:22:42,297 --> 00:22:44,780
Okay.

423
00:22:44,782 --> 00:22:46,716
Buddy of mine who works
out of Voight's precinct

424
00:22:46,718 --> 00:22:48,417
said nothing's come up
in witness statements.

425
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:51,671
So you're trying to tell me
no one else saw his kid drunk.

426
00:22:51,673 --> 00:22:53,122
Hell yes, other people saw his kid drunk.

427
00:22:53,124 --> 00:22:54,223
But they were other cops

428
00:22:54,225 --> 00:22:55,474
who aren't about to go up against Voight.

429
00:22:55,476 --> 00:22:57,843
Well, I would rather
my guy not be the only one

430
00:22:57,845 --> 00:22:59,762
with his head
above the foxhole on this one.

431
00:22:59,764 --> 00:23:01,296
I understand.

432
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:03,649
Passenger in the other car
isn't gonna walk again.

433
00:23:03,651 --> 00:23:05,851
I know. I know.

434
00:23:05,853 --> 00:23:08,854
Look, give me till the end of the shift.

435
00:23:08,856 --> 00:23:10,489
But if I come up empty...

436
00:23:10,491 --> 00:23:12,858
Voight's been pulling his son
out of things like this

437
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,643
since the kid was 15.

438
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:17,530
Lot of people had to turn the other way.

439
00:23:17,532 --> 00:23:19,498
And I'm just telling you,

440
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,284
if it was Gabby who was in your shoes,

441
00:23:22,286 --> 00:23:25,087
and I'm not proud to admit this,

442
00:23:25,089 --> 00:23:26,839
but I'd tell her to stay out of it.

443
00:23:35,632 --> 00:23:38,000
Those tomatoes are only good
for another day or so.

444
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:44,056
Elise, I'm done at the restaurant.

445
00:23:44,058 --> 00:23:47,760
I mean, I came in late
at the beginning of a shift.

446
00:23:47,762 --> 00:23:49,528
That ain't gonna happen again.

447
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:52,064
Mom has just gotta deal with it.

448
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:54,650
- Then tell her.
- Well, I'm going to.

449
00:23:54,652 --> 00:23:56,869
But I need you to back me up, okay?

450
00:23:56,871 --> 00:23:59,321
I mean, you know
what's going on here, right?

451
00:23:59,323 --> 00:24:00,639
Of course.

452
00:24:00,641 --> 00:24:02,992
Why do you think I've been there
on every day off?

453
00:24:02,994 --> 00:24:04,710
You think I like slinging hash?

454
00:24:04,712 --> 00:24:07,529
Hey.

455
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:10,049
Lieutenant Severide,
this is my sister Elise.

456
00:24:10,051 --> 00:24:11,867
Nice to meet you.

457
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:15,921
You too.

458
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:20,559
Mom has just gotta realize

459
00:24:20,561 --> 00:24:23,012
that dad loved being a firefighter.

460
00:24:23,014 --> 00:24:25,181
And I'm not gonna run from something

461
00:24:25,183 --> 00:24:29,185
I want to do with my life
just to make her feel better.

462
00:24:29,187 --> 00:24:30,186
Then reassure her.

463
00:24:30,188 --> 00:24:31,720
- Well, how?
- I don't know.

464
00:24:31,722 --> 00:24:34,640
She's scared.

465
00:24:34,642 --> 00:24:37,059
She doesn't want to lose you too.

466
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,336
Hey.
How the  t-shirts going?

467
00:24:47,338 --> 00:24:48,587
Pretty good.
Couple hundred bucks so far.

468
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:50,739
I'm almost out of
squad tee shirts, though.

469
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:51,740
What about truck shirts?

470
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:53,542
Those are just kinda sitting there.

471
00:24:53,544 --> 00:24:55,261
I think it's because of the goat emblem.

472
00:24:55,263 --> 00:24:57,630
It's not a big seller.
Why a goat?

473
00:24:57,632 --> 00:24:58,881
That's what I'm saying.

474
00:24:58,883 --> 00:25:01,467
The goats are freakin' killing us, guys.

475
00:25:01,469 --> 00:25:03,803
I wouldn't mind an explanation from Casey

476
00:25:03,805 --> 00:25:06,689
on the flat screen of it all.
Drop it.

477
00:25:08,892 --> 00:25:10,276
I didn't know your side job

478
00:25:10,278 --> 00:25:12,278
was the restaurant business, Mills.

479
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,946
For now.
Phasing it out, though.

480
00:25:13,948 --> 00:25:14,980
I think you're the only

481
00:25:14,982 --> 00:25:17,450
food-related side job
we got in here,

482
00:25:17,452 --> 00:25:21,821
'cause let's see, we got
security guard, construction...

483
00:25:21,823 --> 00:25:23,739
What about you?

484
00:25:23,741 --> 00:25:25,274
General entrepreneurship.

485
00:25:25,276 --> 00:25:27,877
I was doing pretty good
as a day trader, you know,

486
00:25:27,879 --> 00:25:30,913
until all the trolls jumped onboard.

487
00:25:30,915 --> 00:25:33,448
And you know,
capsized it for guys like me.

488
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,253
You know, it's... it's funny that
you bring it up, Peter Mills,

489
00:25:37,255 --> 00:25:39,454
because I'm actually circling
an investment opportunity.

490
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:40,723
It could be massive.

491
00:25:40,725 --> 00:25:44,459
You know, and I might
let you guys get in on it.

492
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:45,845
Well, what is it?

493
00:25:45,847 --> 00:25:47,763
Nah, you guys are gonna have to wait,

494
00:25:47,765 --> 00:25:50,933
'cause you know, I...
okay, fine.

495
00:25:50,935 --> 00:25:55,237
Two words: Energy water.

496
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:57,606
Are you kidding me?

497
00:25:57,608 --> 00:26:00,642
Greg Duffy?

498
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:02,027
I guess he was in
a car accident the other day

499
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:03,162
that you guys responded to.

500
00:26:03,164 --> 00:26:04,580
Yeah, what about him?

501
00:26:04,582 --> 00:26:08,150
He's outside.

502
00:26:12,923 --> 00:26:13,989
Sir.

503
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:17,176
Sorry to barge in on you like this,

504
00:26:17,178 --> 00:26:21,630
but my wife made this for you guys.

505
00:26:21,632 --> 00:26:23,766
We really appreciate what you did.

506
00:26:23,768 --> 00:26:26,352
And we know damn well
it could've been worse

507
00:26:26,354 --> 00:26:29,438
if the car had tipped over, so thank you.

508
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,140
- Sure.
- Yeah.

509
00:26:31,142 --> 00:26:32,641
- No problem.
- Sure.

510
00:26:32,643 --> 00:26:34,676
How's your son?

511
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:38,180
Yeah, well...

512
00:26:38,182 --> 00:26:40,515
You know.

513
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:43,518
Mikey's got a tough road ahead of him.

514
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,789
But we're gonna make it.

515
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:49,658
We're gonna be all right.

516
00:26:51,878 --> 00:26:55,998
The other reason I came here is...

517
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,134
I don't know if there's
anything you guys do

518
00:26:59,136 --> 00:27:03,839
in terms of what you saw,
or piece together

519
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:06,559
based on what the accident
scene looked like,

520
00:27:06,561 --> 00:27:09,645
but the police report came back

521
00:27:09,647 --> 00:27:13,449
saying I ran a red light,
causing the accident.

522
00:27:13,451 --> 00:27:16,385
And that's...

523
00:27:16,387 --> 00:27:19,822
that's not what happened.

524
00:27:19,824 --> 00:27:22,557
And I'm...

525
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,892
I'm kind of at a loss

526
00:27:23,894 --> 00:27:28,247
in terms of how to fight it.

527
00:27:39,209 --> 00:27:41,877
Last paragraph.

528
00:27:44,681 --> 00:27:48,467
Visibly drunk.
Smelled alcohol on his breath.

529
00:27:48,469 --> 00:27:52,304
Saw open containers on the passenger seat.

530
00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:05,985
Leaders lead from the front.

531
00:28:19,146 --> 00:28:21,214
There it is, that prick.

532
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:24,878
They will just let
about anybody in this place.

533
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,014
I got an urgent call from hq

534
00:28:27,016 --> 00:28:29,099
saying you guys didn't know
your asses from a tripped horse.

535
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:30,750
They wanted me to come down,
show you how it's done.

536
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,502
Well, come on,
tell me about all that action

537
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:33,870
you get out there in the suburbs.

538
00:28:33,872 --> 00:28:36,223
Don't start now.

539
00:28:36,225 --> 00:28:39,026
Hey, so, how's Nicki doing for you there?

540
00:28:39,028 --> 00:28:41,228
Well, she's great help.

541
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,530
She works hard, no drama,
always got a positive attitude.

542
00:28:43,532 --> 00:28:44,731
She fits right in.
Everybody loves her.

543
00:28:44,733 --> 00:28:46,316
Good, good.

544
00:28:46,318 --> 00:28:48,268
Hey, I appreciate you
doing this for me, buddy.

545
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,453
Ain't no thang.

546
00:28:49,455 --> 00:28:52,939
Is she around?
I told her I'd pick her up.

547
00:28:58,713 --> 00:29:00,580
Our rig.

548
00:29:00,582 --> 00:29:02,449
It's got a cylinder on it
keeps on crackin'.

549
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:04,968
13 years old.
Can't get us a new one.

550
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,136
Come out to Naperville.

551
00:29:06,138 --> 00:29:08,338
We get a new rig every three years.

552
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,589
In the burbs.

553
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:14,811
Leave it on.

554
00:29:14,813 --> 00:29:17,648
Any of y'all seen Nicki?

555
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,733
I haven't chief, sorry.

556
00:29:19,735 --> 00:29:21,401
I'll check the kitchen.
Be right back.

557
00:29:21,403 --> 00:29:23,654
All right, boss.

558
00:29:25,607 --> 00:29:26,606
Hi, dad.

559
00:29:26,608 --> 00:29:28,075
- Hey.
- You're here early.

560
00:29:28,077 --> 00:29:30,110
Zero traffic on the ike,
if you can believe it.

561
00:29:31,113 --> 00:29:33,646
You ready, kiddo?

562
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:35,449
Yeah. Yeah, I,

563
00:29:35,451 --> 00:29:36,649
I'm just gonna go grab my stuff.

564
00:29:36,651 --> 00:29:41,672
- All right, sweetheart.
- Okay.

565
00:29:55,636 --> 00:29:59,506
Hey.
Need to talk to you.

566
00:29:59,508 --> 00:30:02,008
That girl is in serious heat,
and I'm not Ghandi.

567
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,810
What?

568
00:30:03,812 --> 00:30:05,696
No, about your arm.

569
00:30:05,698 --> 00:30:06,730
Here.

570
00:30:06,732 --> 00:30:07,981
What's this?

571
00:30:07,983 --> 00:30:09,366
Friend of mine.
I gave her a heads up.

572
00:30:09,368 --> 00:30:10,567
Cool. Thanks.

573
00:30:10,569 --> 00:30:13,870
Yeah, your appointment's after shift.

574
00:30:13,872 --> 00:30:15,989
You said you were gonna
get your arm looked at.

575
00:30:15,991 --> 00:30:17,040
I know, I am.

576
00:30:17,042 --> 00:30:19,859
I will. I'll... I am.

577
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:21,878
Okay, so I basically feel like

578
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,331
you've been lying to me
in order to get painkillers,

579
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:26,166
and that's not really the quality

580
00:30:26,168 --> 00:30:29,202
I look for in a friend and a roommate.

581
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:35,375
Part of me doesn't want to know.

582
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:37,461
I get it.

583
00:30:37,463 --> 00:30:40,514
Of course, but the
consultation's off the books.

584
00:30:40,516 --> 00:30:44,935
Just you and I will know,
and we'll figure it out.

585
00:30:44,937 --> 00:30:48,739
All right.

586
00:30:48,741 --> 00:30:50,107
Okay.

587
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:58,749
- Hey, Casey.
- What's up?

588
00:30:58,751 --> 00:30:59,950
Just wanted to let you know

589
00:30:59,952 --> 00:31:02,235
that I reached my squad certification.

590
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:03,370
Okay.

591
00:31:03,372 --> 00:31:06,906
And I put in for a transfer.

592
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:11,428
So I just wanted you to know beforehand.

593
00:31:21,055 --> 00:31:25,559
Vargas.

594
00:31:25,561 --> 00:31:28,928
Congratulations, man.
Seriously.

595
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:32,866
Severide will be lucky to have you.

596
00:31:32,868 --> 00:31:36,603
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

597
00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:50,617
You Casey?

598
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:51,618
Yeah.

599
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,137
I'm Hank Voight.

600
00:31:57,809 --> 00:32:00,227
Got time for a drink?

601
00:32:06,818 --> 00:32:08,968
Lotta cops got dinosaur arms

602
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,437
when it comes to pulling their gun.

603
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:11,605
Not me.

604
00:32:11,607 --> 00:32:13,573
You know, I've always been aggressive.

605
00:32:13,575 --> 00:32:14,841
It's the only way to get anything done

606
00:32:14,843 --> 00:32:19,863
in my line of work.

607
00:32:21,282 --> 00:32:25,785
The reason I'm telling you this is...

608
00:32:25,787 --> 00:32:27,537
I put a lot of time into my job.

609
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:29,873
I mean, I cared a lot
about protecting the city

610
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:33,043
and the people in it.

611
00:32:33,045 --> 00:32:36,246
Maybe too much, 'cause...

612
00:32:36,248 --> 00:32:40,884
I wasn't at home a lot,
and I took my eye off my son.

613
00:32:40,886 --> 00:32:42,502
That's on me.

614
00:32:42,504 --> 00:32:45,222
But I am telling you right now

615
00:32:45,224 --> 00:32:47,674
I am gonna be up that kid's ass

616
00:32:47,676 --> 00:32:48,859
until he gets his head on straight.

617
00:32:48,861 --> 00:32:50,777
I'm gonna get him in a program,
the whole deal.

618
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:52,011
You got my word on it.

619
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:54,364
Good to hear.

620
00:32:54,366 --> 00:32:57,234
See, the thing is Justin...

621
00:32:57,236 --> 00:33:00,070
that's my son.

622
00:33:00,072 --> 00:33:03,306
He's got some priors.

623
00:33:03,308 --> 00:33:04,741
This thing that happened the other night,

624
00:33:04,743 --> 00:33:07,494
if there was alcohol involved,
that's a felony.

625
00:33:07,496 --> 00:33:10,914
He does time.

626
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:12,265
Real time.

627
00:33:12,267 --> 00:33:14,417
You ever been to lockup?

628
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:16,836
You been to Statesville?
You been to these places?

629
00:33:16,838 --> 00:33:21,074
You don't want your kid there, trust me.

630
00:33:21,076 --> 00:33:24,094
I'm sympathetic, but...

631
00:33:24,096 --> 00:33:25,428
That's got nothing to do with me.

632
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,697
Sure it does.

633
00:33:27,699 --> 00:33:30,901
You filed a report that said
my son was drunk that night.

634
00:33:30,903 --> 00:33:34,738
- He was.
- Well I need you to retract it.

635
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,390
Let me tell you...

636
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:40,226
I will owe you.
Big time.

637
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:42,579
I'm a good guy to have a favor bank with.

638
00:33:42,581 --> 00:33:46,533
The kid in the other car.
Did you know he's paralyzed?

639
00:33:46,535 --> 00:33:51,254
Yeah.
And it breaks my heart.

640
00:33:51,256 --> 00:33:53,006
But there is no sense

641
00:33:53,008 --> 00:33:54,758
having two tragedies
coming from that night.

642
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,910
And putting 10 years on my son
would be a tragedy,

643
00:33:57,912 --> 00:34:02,432
'cause he's a great guy.

644
00:34:02,434 --> 00:34:06,085
I've been to Statesville.

645
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:09,739
You ever been to a spinal injury center?

646
00:34:09,741 --> 00:34:13,059
Family watches their kid drag his feet

647
00:34:13,061 --> 00:34:14,978
while gripping some parallel bars,

648
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:18,765
clinging to the fantasy
that he'll walk again one day.

649
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:22,202
And the dad quits his job
to help the mom care for him,

650
00:34:22,204 --> 00:34:25,138
and take a second mortgage out
on their house to pay for it.

651
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:28,775
And on top of that,
they have to live with the shame

652
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:30,660
that the police and fire department

653
00:34:30,662 --> 00:34:32,379
shoved a lie down their throat

654
00:34:32,381 --> 00:34:37,116
that they caused the accident?

655
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:38,585
What you're asking me to do...

656
00:34:38,587 --> 00:34:41,621
I'm not asking!

657
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:46,176
If you're not the kind of man
to do a cop a favor,

658
00:34:46,178 --> 00:34:49,612
then I can take this
to the next level real easy.

659
00:34:51,315 --> 00:34:52,866
It was the end of your shift,
you were tired,

660
00:34:52,868 --> 00:34:54,300
you got your paperwork mixed up,

661
00:34:54,302 --> 00:34:58,521
you got your calls mixed up.
There's a million excuses.

662
00:34:58,523 --> 00:35:00,139
Pick one.

663
00:35:00,141 --> 00:35:01,825
'Cause believe me...

664
00:35:01,827 --> 00:35:04,861
You are gonna retract that statement.

665
00:35:04,863 --> 00:35:07,163
'Cause if you don't,

666
00:35:07,165 --> 00:35:09,749
I swear to God...

667
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,004
Casey.

668
00:35:14,006 --> 00:35:16,756
Chief.

669
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,713
Hey, chief,

670
00:35:23,715 --> 00:35:25,164
Can you give us a minute?

671
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:30,153
This is kind of a private conversation.

672
00:35:30,155 --> 00:35:32,522
No, I'm good.

673
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:04,537
I'm not changing a word.

674
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,921
Honestly,

675
00:36:12,088 --> 00:36:14,991
I don't know how you're walking
around let alone working.

676
00:36:15,052 --> 00:36:17,285
What happened?

677
00:36:17,287 --> 00:36:19,821
Jobrelated. I figured it was
just a pinched nerve.

678
00:36:19,823 --> 00:36:21,089
It is.

679
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:23,992
Caused by a fracture in your c5 vertebra.

680
00:36:23,994 --> 00:36:27,645
Right here.

681
00:36:27,647 --> 00:36:29,647
Okay.

682
00:36:36,422 --> 00:36:39,641
You're lucky that you can
feel pain at all right now.

683
00:36:39,643 --> 00:36:42,677
But there's a surgery which can
take pressure off the nerve...

684
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:44,179
how long would I be off work?

685
00:36:44,181 --> 00:36:46,348
Full rehab, six months to a year.

686
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:47,965
How 'bout without the surgery?

687
00:36:47,967 --> 00:36:49,818
We're dealing with motor nerve damage,

688
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,020
so there's no definitive timetable.

689
00:36:52,022 --> 00:36:54,155
But you can expect weakness of the hands,

690
00:36:54,157 --> 00:36:56,324
you can expect muscle atrophy,

691
00:36:56,326 --> 00:37:00,779
and then if it deteriorates,
fasciculation.

692
00:37:00,781 --> 00:37:03,314
Twitching of the hands, of the knees.

693
00:37:03,316 --> 00:37:08,336
After that, you don't want to know.

694
00:37:12,591 --> 00:37:13,842
My brother called.

695
00:37:13,844 --> 00:37:16,711
Asked if you were sure
about what you're doing.

696
00:37:16,713 --> 00:37:18,496
I told him, "you don't
know Casey very well."

697
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:23,501
You holding up all right?

698
00:37:23,503 --> 00:37:26,271
Yeah. Yeah.

699
00:37:26,273 --> 00:37:29,224
I'm good.

700
00:37:32,027 --> 00:37:34,946
What would you have done?

701
00:37:34,948 --> 00:37:37,365
Pssh...

702
00:37:37,367 --> 00:37:41,453
I... y-you know, I went
back and forth on this.

703
00:37:41,455 --> 00:37:46,207
Especially with Antonio in my ear, but...

704
00:37:46,209 --> 00:37:49,210
You want to know the honest answer?

705
00:37:49,212 --> 00:37:53,531
Yeah.

706
00:37:53,533 --> 00:37:55,967
If I held that information
out of the report,

707
00:37:55,969 --> 00:37:57,535
I thought about how I'd feel

708
00:37:57,537 --> 00:38:01,423
looking people I respect in the eye.

709
00:38:01,425 --> 00:38:02,540
You know, and...

710
00:38:02,542 --> 00:38:03,875
I-I guess specifically,

711
00:38:03,877 --> 00:38:07,262
I thought about how I'd feel
looking you in the eye.

712
00:38:12,351 --> 00:38:14,886
And that's when I knew
I would've done the right thing.

713
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:29,167
300, 320, 340...

714
00:38:29,169 --> 00:38:32,370
$344.

715
00:38:32,372 --> 00:38:33,788
We found a 32-inch
over in Roscoe village

716
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:36,741
the guy says it's barely been used.

717
00:38:39,879 --> 00:38:41,245
I got a better idea.

718
00:38:45,101 --> 00:38:46,134
All right.

719
00:38:50,272 --> 00:38:51,439
What's that?

720
00:38:51,441 --> 00:38:53,224
You asked for a level.

721
00:38:53,226 --> 00:38:55,226
That's a t square.

722
00:38:55,228 --> 00:38:57,428
Just...

723
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,063
just go.

724
00:38:59,065 --> 00:39:01,098
Okay.

725
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,746
- Hey.
- Hey.

726
00:39:14,748 --> 00:39:17,949
So, how'd it go?

727
00:39:17,951 --> 00:39:18,950
Good.

728
00:39:18,952 --> 00:39:21,002
Nice lady.

729
00:39:21,004 --> 00:39:23,120
I've just gotta find
a way to manage the pain.

730
00:39:23,122 --> 00:39:27,642
Yeah, kendra said you... you
basically have a broken neck.

731
00:39:27,644 --> 00:39:29,627
Well, if the two of you already talked,

732
00:39:29,629 --> 00:39:33,314
then why are you asking me?

733
00:39:36,468 --> 00:39:39,804
I get that surgery,
there's follow-up exams.

734
00:39:39,806 --> 00:39:41,689
There's paperwork involved.

735
00:39:41,691 --> 00:39:42,974
The department doesn't like how it looks,

736
00:39:42,976 --> 00:39:44,475
I go on long-term disability.

737
00:39:44,477 --> 00:39:46,945
That's 75% pay.

738
00:39:46,947 --> 00:39:48,696
And then do what, shay?

739
00:39:48,698 --> 00:39:53,001
I fish off Navy pier
for the next 20 years?

740
00:39:53,003 --> 00:39:55,537
Working squad is all I want.

741
00:39:55,539 --> 00:39:58,489
It's all I have.

742
00:39:58,491 --> 00:40:03,011
If I have to eat the pain, then I will.

743
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:10,518
Who's that?

744
00:40:13,171 --> 00:40:16,340
Hey. Remember me?

745
00:40:17,677 --> 00:40:18,676
I do.

746
00:40:18,678 --> 00:40:21,946
Nicki is engaged.

747
00:40:24,149 --> 00:40:25,516
Besides, it,

748
00:40:25,518 --> 00:40:30,521
looks like you're already
having your fun, there.

749
00:40:30,523 --> 00:40:32,156
This conversation need to continue?

750
00:40:32,158 --> 00:40:33,491
No, sir, it doesn't.

751
00:40:33,493 --> 00:40:36,628
Right.

752
00:40:42,368 --> 00:40:45,386
There you have it.

753
00:40:54,179 --> 00:40:56,848
Bears game starts in an hour.

754
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,733
Is there a decent spot
around here to watch it?

755
00:40:58,735 --> 00:41:02,687
Not too crowded, not too loud,
and we can get seats?

756
00:41:02,689 --> 00:41:04,555
Yeah.

757
00:41:04,557 --> 00:41:06,524
Yeah, I know a place.

758
00:41:06,526 --> 00:41:08,526
Bring it down.
We're going inside some place.

759
00:41:08,528 --> 00:41:11,112
- Go easy, guys.
- Mom, hey.

760
00:41:11,114 --> 00:41:12,530
This looks like a mom.

761
00:41:12,532 --> 00:41:13,531
This looks like a mom, am I right?

762
00:41:13,533 --> 00:41:14,732
You're right.

763
00:41:14,734 --> 00:41:16,751
Welcome, welcome.
You got a sweet kid.

764
00:41:16,753 --> 00:41:18,036
- Herrmann.
- Herrmann, nice to meet you.

765
00:41:18,038 --> 00:41:19,037
- Hello, mother.
- Mouch.

766
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:20,455
Mouch.

767
00:41:20,457 --> 00:41:23,091
- Mouch. Nice to meet you.
- Mouch. You'll get used to it.

768
00:41:23,093 --> 00:41:25,409
- Otis, nice to meet you.
- Hi, mom. Brian. It's Brian.

769
00:41:25,411 --> 00:41:26,594
- Brian.
- Yes.

770
00:41:26,596 --> 00:41:28,212
Jose, it's a pleasure.
Welcome. Welcome.

771
00:41:28,214 --> 00:41:30,748
- Thanks for having us.
- This is my boss, ma.

772
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,100
This is lieutenant Casey.

773
00:41:32,102 --> 00:41:34,552
Lieutenant Casey, it's
so great to have you guys here.

774
00:41:34,554 --> 00:41:35,937
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

775
00:41:35,939 --> 00:41:38,940
And hey, this is my sister Elise.

776
00:41:38,942 --> 00:41:40,942
Hey, Elise!

777
00:41:40,944 --> 00:41:43,027
Really? Thank you.

778
00:41:43,029 --> 00:41:46,564
- Can I talk to you a minute?
- Yeah.

779
00:41:46,566 --> 00:41:51,569
I don't sleep at night when he's on shift.

780
00:41:51,571 --> 00:41:53,721
I'll look after him.

781
00:41:53,723 --> 00:41:56,324
I promise.

782
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,946
All right, cheers, cheer.

783
00:42:01,948 --> 00:42:03,748
Okay, you guys, make yourselves at home.

784
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:04,782
We'll bring some food out.

785
00:42:04,784 --> 00:42:06,467
- Thank you.
- Food!

786
00:42:09,255 --> 00:42:11,789
- He knows, he knows.
- Shall we?

787
00:42:11,791 --> 00:42:13,675
- Yes.
- Just keeps getting better!

788
00:42:14,843 --> 00:42:17,011
Welcome to soldier field in Chicago...

789
00:42:17,013 --> 00:42:19,097
I really want my honey bears back.

790
00:42:19,099 --> 00:42:20,631
That's what I want.

791
00:42:20,633 --> 00:42:23,651
25 years.

792

<i>School fire.
4548 West Quincy.</i>

2
00:00:03,117 --> 00:00:04,768
That's Donna's school!

3
00:00:04,804 --> 00:00:08,804
- Donna!
- Wallace!

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,710
I got her! Hey, if you can
move, move!

5
00:00:14,746 --> 00:00:16,578
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

6
00:00:16,614 --> 00:00:19,349
<i>Mrs. Wagner went in
for a second surgery,</i>

7
00:00:19,385 --> 00:00:21,584
<i>and it is still critical.</i>

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,421
Fire wasn't an accident.

9
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:27,657
I have successfully signed up
Firehouse 51

10
00:00:27,693 --> 00:00:30,560
for the Firefighter Muster!

11

<i>This is just for a few weeks.</i>

12
00:00:32,363 --> 00:00:35,765
Feel free to do whatever
you need to do.

13
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:37,766
I'm Hope, Sylvie's friend.

14
00:00:37,802 --> 00:00:40,472
I just wanted you to know
that you can text me anytime.

15
00:01:12,203 --> 00:01:14,203
See? I knew this roomie
situation

16
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:16,105
was gonna work out
great.

17
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,112
Cheers.

18
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:32,254
Well, I didn't lie, right?

19
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,123
Over Easy's the best breakfast
in Chicago.

20
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,328
Totally. I'm telling you,
I love every part of this city.

21
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,596
Feels so good to get
out of Fowlerton.

22
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:42,634
Even if it was just
for a little bit.

23
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:46,201
Is everything okay
back at home?

24
00:01:46,237 --> 00:01:52,207
Yeah, it's fine. It's just
you know... Fowlerton.

25
00:01:52,243 --> 00:01:54,244
Come on, you bum!
Move your tail!

26
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,613
Shift's starting!

27
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:59,482
Hey, Hope.

28
00:01:59,518 --> 00:02:01,351
Hi, Otis!

29
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,585
I'm so sorry about
these buffoons!

30
00:02:03,621 --> 00:02:08,324
Thank you for the ride, and
I hope you enjoy Sears Tower.

31
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,661
Thanks. I will.

32
00:02:11,697 --> 00:02:14,764
Really mature
behavior, as usual.

33
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,401
You guys jumped like a foot
out of your seats.

34
00:02:18,437 --> 00:02:20,637
Yeah, any chance
you had with Hope is gone.

35
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:22,504
What? No, women love
that kind of stuff.

36
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,506
I'm a woman.

37
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:25,574
Mmm... not in those pants.

38
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:43,526
Donna believes the fire was
intentionally set.

39
00:02:43,562 --> 00:02:45,562
Did one of the students
see what happened?

40
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,330
No. Nobody was there
when it started.

41
00:02:48,366 --> 00:02:50,733
But after the fire, when
we were outside the school,

42
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:55,538
the way the chem lab students
were whispering to each other...

43
00:02:55,574 --> 00:02:57,472
it's like they knew something.

44
00:02:57,508 --> 00:02:59,876
Did you hear anything
specific? Any names?

45
00:02:59,912 --> 00:03:01,477
- Anything?
- No.

46
00:03:01,513 --> 00:03:02,978
A lot of the faculty have
reached out.

47
00:03:03,014 --> 00:03:04,546
We brought in a counselor,

48
00:03:04,582 --> 00:03:06,348
but none of these students
will talk.

49
00:03:06,384 --> 00:03:08,418
So you think
one of the students did this?

50
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:12,955
Yeah. I just don't
know which one,

51
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:16,592
and if any of the others
saw it happen.

52
00:03:16,628 --> 00:03:19,695
Look, I know all of this sounds
really vague, but...

53
00:03:19,731 --> 00:03:21,830
Donna's instincts with
the case are dead on.

54
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:23,633
She says they're hiding
something, then they are.

55
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:25,234
What does OFI say?

56
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,936
They're still investigating
the scene.

57
00:03:26,972 --> 00:03:29,405
I just spoke with Lt. Hubble.
She says with all the chemicals

58
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:31,373
stored in the lab,
and all the gas lines,

59
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:33,443
they're just going to go
under the assumption that

60
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,544
it was an accident, unless
we find evidence of arson.

61
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,546
Meanwhile, Jamie Wagner
is in the hospital

62
00:03:37,582 --> 00:03:39,314
with burns all over her body.

63
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,650
I'd like you two to go
to the school.

64
00:03:40,686 --> 00:03:43,318
Make sure OFI doesn't
miss anything.

65
00:03:43,354 --> 00:03:45,254
Yeah, you got it, Chief.

Great, squad's here.

70
00:04:15,454 --> 00:04:18,553
C'mon, Severide, let us have
some fun once in a while.

71
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,322
You think I want to break
a sweat, Labedzki?

72
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:22,861
- Where's your lieutenant?
- Down below.

73
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:28,497
Hey, Wolanski! We got
Truck 81 and Squad 3 here.

74
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:30,365
Just let us know
where you want us.

75
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:32,567
Okay, stand by. I'm gonna get
this driver stabilized...

76
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,004
Get out of there!

Hey, Wolanski! Look at me!

85

Good, just pull me out.

- Okay.
- Worth a try.

87

Let's hurry up
with those airbags!

I keep telling you, Wolanski.
Lay off the donuts!

91
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:28,358
Don't make me laugh.
I'll break a rib.

92
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,127
What's happening over there?

93
00:05:31,163 --> 00:05:34,697
Sorry, lieutenant! Get it
together, 81! What the hell?

94
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:36,699
Easy, Labedzki, it was
nobody's fault.

95
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:39,372
- Yeah, right!
- Come on, Kidd!

96
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,712
- Ready?
- Almost there!

97
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:50,113
- Got it!
- All right.

98
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,714
Let me know
when you're ready, Cruz.

99
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,848
Good to go.

100
00:05:52,884 --> 00:05:55,817
All right, up on one.

101
00:05:59,891 --> 00:06:01,557
All right, up on two!

All right, all right.

- Okay, on three, pull. Ready?
- Yep.

- Don't move. Don't move.
- I'm okay.

We gotta make sure.

109
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,949
No, I'm okay.
Don't worry about me.

110

Take care of the driver.

Thank you.

- He's stabilized.
- All yours, guys.

113
00:06:40,232 --> 00:06:43,436
- Watch his head.
- You got him?

114
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,415
You're welcome!

115

Hey Mouch, how many people
of the Polish persuasion

116
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,553
does it take to rescue
an injured motorist?

117
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:06,055
Are you funny now?
You a comedian?

118
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:09,524
Hey, relax, Labedzki.
I'm just checking your hearing.

119
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,560
Boy, you guys
from 51 really think

120
00:07:11,596 --> 00:07:12,995
you're God's gift,
don't you?

121
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:15,564
We bailed you out.
Be gracious about it.

122
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:22,839
Hey! Hey! Let's put all this
aggression where it belongs:

123
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:27,642
on the field at the All-Chicago
Semi-Annual Firefighter Muster!

124
00:07:27,678 --> 00:07:30,579
Are you kidding?
We'll knock you on your ass.

125
00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:33,682
1,000 bucks says otherwise.

126
00:07:33,718 --> 00:07:35,851
Uh...
Wait... what? Mouch...

127
00:07:35,887 --> 00:07:37,118
100 bucks a man.

128
00:07:37,154 --> 00:07:39,221
You're on.

129
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:41,726
May the best house win.

130
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:50,603
You're welcome.

131
00:07:57,776 --> 00:07:59,908
I'm gonna visit Jamie
after work.

132
00:07:59,944 --> 00:08:02,144
Doctor says she's still
having a hard time breathing.

133
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,014
- Sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.

134
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,019
I'll join you.

135
00:08:08,987 --> 00:08:11,219
How are you supposed to hold
class when most

136
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:13,122
of the second floor is
destroyed?

137
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:15,625
Math and science are in
the cafeteria for a few months

138
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,562
while they rebuild.

139
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,668
Some of those kids were
in the chem lab.

140
00:08:25,704 --> 00:08:29,605
Maybe if I wasn't new here,
or had a smarter approach,

141
00:08:29,641 --> 00:08:30,973
they'd talk to me.

142
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:33,008
Ellie, you've done
all that you can.

143
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:35,113
Doesn't feel like it.

144
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:42,955
Whoever started the fire is
still in there somewhere.

145
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,860
You still sure about that?

146
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:53,061
You may know
fires, Wallace,

147
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:55,031
but I know kids.

148
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,135
You have to trust me.

149
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:00,036
I do.

150
00:09:16,914 --> 00:09:20,046
I haven't told anyone
about this,

151
00:09:20,082 --> 00:09:25,252
not even Trudy, but when
my heart stopped,

152
00:09:25,288 --> 00:09:29,022
when I was going
into the light,

153
00:09:29,058 --> 00:09:30,958
I saw something.

154
00:09:30,994 --> 00:09:35,496
I saw that I was surrounded

155
00:09:35,532 --> 00:09:38,398
by all the people of 51.

156
00:09:38,434 --> 00:09:42,737
We were hand in hand,
helping each other ascend

157
00:09:42,773 --> 00:09:45,071
a grand staircase,

158
00:09:45,107 --> 00:09:49,944
which rose up
towards a golden chalice.

159
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,981
Only now do I understand

160
00:09:54,017 --> 00:09:55,915
the meaning of this vision.

161
00:09:55,951 --> 00:10:01,222
We are going to win
the Firefighter Muster.

162
00:10:01,258 --> 00:10:04,358
It's funny how you never
told us about this vision

163
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:07,093
until after you backed us
into a $1,000 bet.

164
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:13,032
Mock all you want, friends,
but I know what I experienced.

165
00:10:13,068 --> 00:10:18,439
As your coach, I have assigned
each of you to an event

166
00:10:18,475 --> 00:10:22,977
to maximize our chances
of winning.

167
00:10:23,013 --> 00:10:25,883
- Mouch!
- Guys, come on.

168
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,349
Mouch almost died.

169
00:10:29,385 --> 00:10:31,755
Are we really
going to deny him this?

170
00:10:33,222 --> 00:10:35,021
Let's see the list.

171
00:10:35,057 --> 00:10:38,124
How long are we gonna be
under this dead Mouch tyranny?

172
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,959
Can I see?

173
00:10:39,995 --> 00:10:42,997
Hey look! It's you and me
on ladder throw. Not bad.

174
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:45,232
Oh, hey, we're teamed up
for the hose stretch.

175
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:47,066
We will slay that.

176
00:10:47,102 --> 00:10:51,271
Mmm. Hey, you want to meet up
at Severide's after shift?

177
00:10:51,307 --> 00:10:53,373
We could walk to that nearby
playground? Practice?

178
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:55,879
- Severide's?
- Yeah, I live there now.

179
00:10:58,181 --> 00:11:00,948
Up the grand staircase
we go, 51!

180
00:11:02,384 --> 00:11:04,084
Great work, buddy.
I can't wait to see

181
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,452
what my
assignment is.

182
00:11:05,488 --> 00:11:08,555
- There you go.
- Mouch, this is awesome.

183
00:11:08,591 --> 00:11:11,358
I'm just wondering... you have me
on dummy drag?

184
00:11:11,394 --> 00:11:15,228
And in paramedic training,
we don't do dummy drags.

185
00:11:15,264 --> 00:11:16,964
Don't sell yourself short.

186
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,165
Oh! Buddy, you got me
here on the pole hang,

187
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:20,968
and it's just that's not
so good for me,

188
00:11:21,004 --> 00:11:24,103
'cause I still got that shoulder
thing, so maybe we could...

189
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:26,140
The bucket brigade is all
lunkheads.

190
00:11:26,176 --> 00:11:30,881
- I'm not doing it this year.
- Do not question the vision!

191
00:11:48,197 --> 00:11:50,997
- Hey, Van Meter.
- Hey, Severide.

192
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:56,136
Hey, this is Matthew Casey.
Mind if we have a look around?

193
00:11:56,172 --> 00:12:00,140
Sure thing, just wrapping up.
You guys work this fire?

194
00:12:00,176 --> 00:12:03,109
Yeah. Find the cause yet?

195
00:12:03,145 --> 00:12:07,146
We can confirm it started
in the chemistry lab,

196
00:12:07,182 --> 00:12:09,083
but you knew that.

197
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:10,617
Classroom was empty,

198
00:12:10,653 --> 00:12:13,053
sixth period chemistry
had just ended.

199
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:16,357
Somebody smelled smoke
and the teacher ran back here,

200
00:12:16,393 --> 00:12:18,092
found a fire burning
on the counter.

201
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:21,060
She tried to put it out,
but it burned hot and fast,

202
00:12:21,096 --> 00:12:24,231
fed by the various flammables
in the storage cabinet.

203
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:25,531
She probably succumbed
right away,

204
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:27,300
and the fire
continued to spread.

205
00:12:27,336 --> 00:12:29,002
How did it start?

206
00:12:29,038 --> 00:12:31,005
Chemicals on the counter.
Don't know what yet.

207
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,672
We figured maybe
an experiment was left out,

208
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:36,142
but then one of my guys
just spotted this.

209
00:12:36,178 --> 00:12:38,411
Char line?

210
00:12:38,447 --> 00:12:40,180
Somebody poured
a stream of accelerant

211
00:12:40,216 --> 00:12:42,116
leading right to the door.

212
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:44,050
So arson.

213
00:12:44,086 --> 00:12:47,524
We'll be escalating this
to a criminal investigation.

214
00:12:52,227 --> 00:12:54,298
Donna was right.

215
00:12:56,466 --> 00:12:58,564
Casey, isn't that where
we found the teacher?

216
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,972
Yep. Why?
What are you thinking?

217
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:15,214
- Hey, Van Meter?
- What do we got?

218
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,483
These vinyl tiles are
pre-code.

219
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,252
They should've been updated
years ago.

220
00:13:19,288 --> 00:13:21,488
Instead, they just slapped
a layer of polyurethane down

221
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:24,257
- to cover it up.
- Okay.

222
00:13:24,293 --> 00:13:26,459
This is how we got
our victim out.

223
00:13:26,495 --> 00:13:30,597
In this direction,
down this path here.

224
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:34,334
Something must have scraped
the polyurethane,

225
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:38,071
Maybe a carabiner
on our webbing?

226
00:13:38,107 --> 00:13:40,708
The fire burned the exposed
portion of the tiles,

227
00:13:40,744 --> 00:13:42,312
leaving that trail.

228
00:13:45,682 --> 00:13:47,513
So this char line was formed

229
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:49,516
after the fire was
already burning?

230
00:13:49,552 --> 00:13:52,252
Definitely.
There was no accelerant here.

231
00:13:52,288 --> 00:13:54,557
So, no arson.

232
00:14:01,798 --> 00:14:03,630
No, you can't really blame
Van Meter.

233
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,398
I mean, he had no way of
knowing

234
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:07,704
that we carved that trail
he was looking at.

235
00:14:09,438 --> 00:14:11,238
I'm confused.

236
00:14:11,274 --> 00:14:13,040
If it wasn't accelerant,

237
00:14:13,076 --> 00:14:14,507
how did the fire start?

238
00:14:14,543 --> 00:14:16,276
It could've been improperly
stored chemicals.

239
00:14:16,312 --> 00:14:18,679
They had a lot of old, outdated
stuff in those cabinets.

240
00:14:18,715 --> 00:14:21,382
Yeah, we just gotta get
the lab results.

241
00:14:21,418 --> 00:14:23,617
Help me to understand this.

242
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:27,154
I sent you there to help OFI
look for signs of arson,

243
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,055
but instead you rule it out.

244
00:14:29,091 --> 00:14:31,025
- We didn't rule it out, Chief.
- No.

245
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:32,693
Look, they were headed
down a blind alley

246
00:14:32,729 --> 00:14:34,694
with the whole char line.
We just set them straight.

247
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:37,131
We have a teacher
that may not survive.

248
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,733
The police are not going to put
any resources into this thing

249
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:43,170
until it escalates to a criminal
investigation, so please,

250
00:14:43,206 --> 00:14:46,305
go back there. You keep digging
until you find something

251
00:14:46,341 --> 00:14:48,574
that can make that happen.

252
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,614
What if Donna's
hunch is wrong?

253
00:14:53,716 --> 00:14:57,284
All right. We'll take
another look, Chief.

254
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:22,432
I mean, really what does
he want us to do?

255
00:15:22,468 --> 00:15:24,066
Cook up some evidence that
points to arson?

256
00:15:24,102 --> 00:15:25,453
He just wants us to make sure

257
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:26,862
nothing falls through the
cracks.

258
00:15:26,898 --> 00:15:28,810
And if we can't find anything?
Then what?

259
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:30,288
You're gonna be the one that
walks back in there

260
00:15:30,324 --> 00:15:33,228
- and tells him?
- It's that bad, huh?

261
00:15:33,264 --> 00:15:35,313
Boden's not thinking
clearly on this one.

262
00:15:35,349 --> 00:15:36,915
I understand
where he's coming from.

263
00:15:36,951 --> 00:15:40,151
Donna could've died
in that fire.

264
00:15:40,187 --> 00:15:41,820
What are we supposed to do?

265
00:15:41,856 --> 00:15:43,153
We already checked
the classroom.

266
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:46,060
OFI is processing the samples.

267
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:50,110
Talk to the
chemistry students.

268
00:15:50,146 --> 00:15:51,597
Donna can't get anything out
of them.

269
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:52,681
Why would they talk to us?

270
00:15:52,717 --> 00:15:54,249
Well, they've had a few days
for the shock to wear off,

271
00:15:54,285 --> 00:15:55,949
and the gravity to sink in.

272
00:15:55,985 --> 00:15:57,452
Anyway, people trust
firefighters.

273
00:15:57,488 --> 00:15:59,123
They open up to us.

274
00:16:01,392 --> 00:16:04,028
It's worth a try.

275
00:16:08,431 --> 00:16:12,966
This is where we stuck
Mrs. Wagner's chemistry class.

276
00:16:13,002 --> 00:16:15,381
Mr. Royce, these are the
firefighters

277
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:17,165
who rescued Mrs. Wagner.

278
00:16:17,201 --> 00:16:18,801
Is it okay if they have a word
with your kids?

279
00:16:18,837 --> 00:16:21,745
- Sure, of course.
- Great, thanks.

280
00:16:23,814 --> 00:16:26,346
How you guys holding up?

281
00:16:26,382 --> 00:16:30,467
I'm sure you've heard Mrs.
Wagner is in critical condition,

282
00:16:30,503 --> 00:16:33,086
but please keep thinking
good thoughts.

283
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:34,722
I've seen people come back
from worse.

284
00:16:34,758 --> 00:16:37,726
We're still trying to figure
out how the fire started.

285
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:39,027
We're wondering if anyone

286
00:16:39,063 --> 00:16:40,394
noticed anything
that might help.

287
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,865
Any little detail.
A Bunsen burner left on.

288
00:16:44,901 --> 00:16:48,769
A chemical spill on the counter.
Saw someone go into the lab.

289
00:16:48,805 --> 00:16:50,105
Anything.

290
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:52,240
Are you the one who
saved that girl?

291
00:16:52,276 --> 00:16:55,175
No, I didn't save her.
You guys did that.

292
00:16:55,211 --> 00:16:58,248
- What's your name?
- Rashidi.

293
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,883
I heard someone screaming,
so I ran in there.

294
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,086
Her clothes were on fire.
I just tried to put 'em out.

295
00:17:05,122 --> 00:17:08,323
- How's she doing?
- She's all right.

296
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:12,126
Second degree
burns on her legs, but...

297
00:17:12,162 --> 00:17:14,929
It would've been a lot worse
if you weren't there to help.

298
00:17:17,334 --> 00:17:19,000
Hey, Keith Moon.

299
00:17:21,538 --> 00:17:25,173
Where were you when
the fire broke out?

300
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:27,040
Period's over.

301
00:17:27,076 --> 00:17:29,978
Come on, Mateo. How about
a little cooperation, huh?

302
00:17:44,394 --> 00:17:45,827
Hey.

303
00:17:45,863 --> 00:17:48,241
Takes a lot of guts to run into
a fire

304
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:50,834
when everyone else
is running the other way.

305
00:17:53,336 --> 00:17:56,141
What is it, Rashidi?

306
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:04,212
Uh... uh... nothing.

307
00:18:04,248 --> 00:18:06,351
Now I gotta get to trig.

308
00:18:10,187 --> 00:18:12,052
Hey!

309
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:27,836
Hey, where did you find these
hoses? They look pretty new.

310
00:18:27,872 --> 00:18:31,873
Yeah, I told Romero I needed
them for a class at the academy.

311
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:35,329
You slut! You know he has
a thing for you,

312
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:36,845
and you totally took advantage.

313
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:40,548
- He does not have a thing.
- Oh, don't play coy with me.

314
00:18:40,584 --> 00:18:43,518
It's been way too long
since we hung out.

315
00:18:43,554 --> 00:18:49,590
Ugh, I know, but at least
we get to work together.

316
00:18:49,626 --> 00:18:54,295
Yeah, it's not the same.
We gotta try harder.

317
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:55,997
Make an effort for some girl
time, you know?

318
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:57,397
Yeah.

319
00:18:57,433 --> 00:18:59,267
I didn't even know
you moved in with Severide.

320
00:18:59,303 --> 00:19:01,903
It's no big deal.
It was a last minute thing.

321
00:19:01,939 --> 00:19:04,504
He kind of swooped in
and saved the day.

322
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,473
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

323
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:09,277
Look, I'm not hung up
on him at all,

324
00:19:09,313 --> 00:19:11,078
if that's what
you're getting at.

325
00:19:11,114 --> 00:19:13,948
Okay.

326
00:19:13,984 --> 00:19:16,387
- Come on, let's see what you got.
- All right.

327
00:19:17,254 --> 00:19:19,019
Rashidi was gonna say
something,

328
00:19:19,055 --> 00:19:22,423
but one look from Mateo,
and he just clammed up tight.

329
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:25,158
Yeah, he's intimidated
for sure.

330
00:19:25,194 --> 00:19:27,028
What's the deal
with this Mateo kid?

331
00:19:27,064 --> 00:19:29,897
Mateo Cabrera, repeated
9th and 11th grades.

332
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:33,100
Always in trouble. You know,
fist fights, bullying.

333
00:19:33,136 --> 00:19:35,904
Last year, he was suspended for
starting fires in a trash can

334
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,471
on school grounds.

335
00:19:37,507 --> 00:19:39,539
Anybody know where Mateo was
when it all went down?

336
00:19:39,575 --> 00:19:41,643
I pulled his schedule.
He had a free period

337
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,212
right after chem lab.
Could've been anywhere.

338
00:19:44,248 --> 00:19:47,915
I also found out he was one of
four assigned to the lab table

339
00:19:47,951 --> 00:19:49,450
where the fire started.

340
00:19:49,486 --> 00:19:51,618
- Hard to argue with that.
- So what happens now?

341
00:19:51,654 --> 00:19:54,655
I'll try and talk to Mateo.
See if he's got an alibi.

342
00:19:54,691 --> 00:19:56,691
Talk to him? No,
you've got to lock him up.

343
00:19:56,727 --> 00:19:59,093
- Donna.
- We don't have forensics yet

344
00:19:59,129 --> 00:20:00,461
that makes this an arson.

345
00:20:00,497 --> 00:20:02,497
You can't charge somebody
without a crime.

346
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:04,464
The other students could've
been killed by this kid,

347
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,067
and now they've got to sit next
to him in class?

348
00:20:06,103 --> 00:20:08,435
- No, that's crazy.
- Mrs. Boden, I'm with you.

349
00:20:08,471 --> 00:20:10,305
I will do what I can.

350
00:20:10,341 --> 00:20:12,406
You get a confession out of
him, you don't need forensics.

351
00:20:12,442 --> 00:20:15,209
Okay, let's manage
our expectations.

352
00:20:15,245 --> 00:20:17,211
I gotta get him to talk
to me first.

353
00:20:17,247 --> 00:20:21,281
- One step at a time.
- Okay.

354
00:20:21,317 --> 00:20:24,218
Thanks for coming by.

355
00:20:24,254 --> 00:20:26,391
I'll get this.

356
00:20:27,591 --> 00:20:31,291
- Thanks.
- Chief? Ah, you're all here.

357
00:20:31,327 --> 00:20:33,126
Sirs, I just wanted to make sure

358
00:20:33,162 --> 00:20:35,462
we can count on you all
for the Muster tug-of-war.

359
00:20:35,498 --> 00:20:37,097
- It's kind of the big finale...
- Mouch.

360
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:38,633
- Yeah, Chief.
- I'm not putting my back out

361
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:40,600
because you made a bet with 87.

362
00:20:40,636 --> 00:20:43,006
Oh, okay.

363
00:20:46,744 --> 00:20:48,046
Hey!

364
00:20:49,712 --> 00:20:52,646
- Hey!
- What is this thing?

365
00:20:52,682 --> 00:20:56,984
Dummy drag practice. I know
I can get better at this.

366
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,253
It's all in the lift.

367
00:21:04,495 --> 00:21:07,260
Hey, Brett! We told you to
stop getting grabby

368
00:21:07,296 --> 00:21:08,695
with the guys around
the firehouse!

369
00:21:08,731 --> 00:21:10,999
I've carried plenty of victims
twice that size

370
00:21:11,035 --> 00:21:12,666
on the stair chair.

371
00:21:12,702 --> 00:21:15,470
Hey, forget two hands, okay?
Grab the dummy with one hand,

372
00:21:15,506 --> 00:21:17,137
by the wrist, and you get
running!

373
00:21:17,173 --> 00:21:18,673
It's good forward momentum.

374
00:21:18,709 --> 00:21:21,241
No way. Two arms, backwards.
You just, you know start

375
00:21:21,277 --> 00:21:23,344
with a good thrust, you get
going, and then use your own

376
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,279
weight to keep the momentum
moving. Okay?

377
00:21:26,315 --> 00:21:28,148
- Okay.
- You're gonna do great!

378
00:21:28,184 --> 00:21:30,721
All right?
Just takes some practice.

379
00:21:31,755 --> 00:21:33,721
You're really lucky,
you know that?

380
00:21:33,757 --> 00:21:36,257
To be part of
such a close-knit group.

381
00:21:36,293 --> 00:21:38,326
It's like a family.

382
00:21:38,362 --> 00:21:41,128
Yeah, it is.
For better or worse, trust me.

383
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:44,531
I'm gonna grab some water
in the kitchen

384
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:47,504
- 'cause you need it!
- Thanks, Hope.

385
00:21:56,779 --> 00:21:58,348
Hey there.

386
00:21:59,248 --> 00:22:01,581
Hey, you're still in Chicago.

387
00:22:01,617 --> 00:22:03,417
For another week or so.

388
00:22:03,453 --> 00:22:06,520
Don't forget you made a promise
we would hang out before I left.

389
00:22:06,556 --> 00:22:08,722
That's not the kind of thing
that slips my mind.

390
00:22:08,758 --> 00:22:10,460
Good.

391
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:19,403
That girl has been hanging out
at the firehouse a lot lately.

392
00:22:22,105 --> 00:22:23,770
What?

393
00:22:23,806 --> 00:22:25,205
What? Am I wrong?

394
00:22:25,241 --> 00:22:27,107
No comment.

395
00:22:27,143 --> 00:22:31,345
<i>Ambulance 61, person down.
8133 71st Street.</i>

396
00:22:31,381 --> 00:22:32,814
Oh, hey, Hope!
I gotta go on a run,

397
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,714
but feel free to hang out.
I'll be right back.

398
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,250
- Will do.
- Okay.

399
00:22:50,834 --> 00:22:53,134
I'm the one who called. I was
on my way to the rec center,

400
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:56,074
and I saw him on the ground.
He's taken a beating.

401
00:23:00,344 --> 00:23:02,109
I can't move my arm.

402
00:23:02,145 --> 00:23:04,815
Brett, isn't this the kid
from the school fire?

403
00:23:19,788 --> 00:23:21,820
I remember you from
the school. What's your name?

404
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,221
My arm, man, it hurts.

405
00:23:23,257 --> 00:23:24,875
His name is Rashidi.
Rashidi Taylor.

406
00:23:24,911 --> 00:23:26,859
He's a lifeguard here
on the weekends.

407
00:23:26,895 --> 00:23:28,456
All right, Rashidi.
You're gonna be okay.

408
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:29,695
We're gonna give you some
morphine,

409
00:23:29,731 --> 00:23:30,829
it's gonna help with
the pain.

410
00:23:30,865 --> 00:23:32,363
Who did this to you?

411
00:23:32,399 --> 00:23:36,168
I don't know. Some kids...
Maybe a group of them.

412
00:23:36,204 --> 00:23:39,375
No one I know, definitely. I've
never seen any of them before.

413
00:23:45,847 --> 00:23:47,979
- Oh, my God.
- Hang in there, Rashidi.

414
00:23:48,015 --> 00:23:49,247
She's gonna give you
some morphine,

415
00:23:49,283 --> 00:23:51,850
and that'll kick in
in a little bit.

416
00:23:54,272 --> 00:23:56,008
I'll call your mom, Rashidi.

417
00:24:00,445 --> 00:24:02,981
We're gonna get you
to climb up there, okay?

418
00:24:05,784 --> 00:24:06,819
Okay.

419
00:24:07,953 --> 00:24:10,956
He knows who attacked him.
He just didn't want to say.

420
00:24:25,102 --> 00:24:27,068
- Wallace!
- Donna.

421
00:24:27,104 --> 00:24:29,470
How did this happen?

422
00:24:29,506 --> 00:24:31,340
How does a thing like this
happen?

423
00:24:31,376 --> 00:24:34,209
It's a dislocated elbow.
Rashidi's gonna be fine.

424
00:24:34,245 --> 00:24:36,812
But he's denying
that it's Mateo.

425
00:24:36,848 --> 00:24:38,814
And you two didn't even
believe me about the fire.

426
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,481
We just heard.
I'm sorry this happened.

427
00:24:40,517 --> 00:24:43,352
Did you hear about
Jamie Wagner?

428
00:24:43,388 --> 00:24:45,787
They just put her into
a medically induced coma.

429
00:24:45,823 --> 00:24:47,823
Something about having to
protect lungs or something...

430
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:51,492
I don't know!
It doesn't look good.

431
00:24:51,528 --> 00:24:54,196
When is Hubble getting
those lab results?

432
00:24:54,232 --> 00:24:56,230
You want to call OFI again?

433
00:24:56,266 --> 00:24:58,536
I can do more than that.

434
00:25:04,242 --> 00:25:06,374
Ready, and go!

435
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,980
- Go.
- Set!

436
00:25:10,515 --> 00:25:12,985
Raise it up!
Ahh!

437
00:25:15,553 --> 00:25:17,119
- Set it down!
- Yep!

438
00:25:17,155 --> 00:25:18,452
Lay it in!

439
00:25:18,488 --> 00:25:21,155
Go! Go, go, go, go!

440
00:25:21,191 --> 00:25:23,124
- You got this! Move it!
- Come on, come on, come on!

441
00:25:24,595 --> 00:25:26,562
- Oh! 12 seconds!
- Yeah!

442
00:25:26,598 --> 00:25:28,529
Best time since
Spider Ferguson and his brother

443
00:25:28,565 --> 00:25:30,498
did 10 flat in '07!

444
00:25:30,534 --> 00:25:34,369
And I think
they were on the juice.

445
00:25:34,405 --> 00:25:37,072
How's that pole hang going,
Cruz?

446
00:25:37,108 --> 00:25:40,879
Not great, but okay.

447
00:25:42,546 --> 00:25:45,082
I'll be on the radio!

448
00:25:50,554 --> 00:25:53,588
Whoa.

449
00:25:53,624 --> 00:25:57,459
I hate this dumb dummy.

450
00:25:57,495 --> 00:26:00,062
He is so unmanageable.

451
00:26:00,098 --> 00:26:03,565
Yeah, it sucks when they won't
just do what you want them to.

452
00:26:03,601 --> 00:26:08,402
Okay, let's get this guy
back in the closet

453
00:26:08,438 --> 00:26:10,141
where he belongs.

454
00:26:14,178 --> 00:26:17,312
Your friend Hope has been
visiting the firehouse a lot.

455
00:26:17,348 --> 00:26:19,614
Yeah, yeah.
She really likes it here.

456
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:23,418
I think she might be dealing
with something back at home.

457
00:26:23,454 --> 00:26:25,319
What kind of thing?

458
00:26:25,355 --> 00:26:27,221
I don't know.

459
00:26:27,257 --> 00:26:30,325
She won't tell me,
which is weird,

460
00:26:30,361 --> 00:26:34,162
because growing up,
we shared everything.

461
00:26:34,198 --> 00:26:36,565
People change.

462
00:26:36,601 --> 00:26:39,101
I mean you don't notice so much
when you're around them,

463
00:26:39,137 --> 00:26:42,640
but spend some time apart...

464
00:26:44,475 --> 00:26:48,175
Whoa. You look as beat up
as I feel.

465
00:26:48,211 --> 00:26:50,114
Muster-itis.

466
00:26:51,381 --> 00:26:54,151
I'm headed to the app floor.
I'll take your dummy.

467
00:27:26,516 --> 00:27:28,419
Hey, Mateo.

468
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:33,587
Hey, I hear you like
intimidating people.

469
00:27:33,623 --> 00:27:35,690
Get the hell
away from me, man.

470
00:27:35,726 --> 00:27:39,126
You beat up Rashidi,
and we know why.

471
00:27:39,162 --> 00:27:41,565
He knows you lit that fire.

472
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:46,535
You sound like you got it
all figured out.

473
00:27:46,571 --> 00:27:49,237
- Oh, I do.
- So what you want from me?

474
00:27:49,273 --> 00:27:52,207
I want you to admit it.

475
00:27:52,243 --> 00:27:57,144
Okay, sure. I dropped
Rashidi's punk ass,

476
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:01,216
and I chucked a match
in the chem lab. So what?

477
00:28:01,252 --> 00:28:03,552
So what?

478
00:28:03,588 --> 00:28:05,720
Your teacher could die.

479
00:28:05,756 --> 00:28:08,060
That's not my problem, man.

480
00:28:09,694 --> 00:28:13,428
- Huh?
- That's all you got, man?

481
00:28:13,464 --> 00:28:15,296
- Get off of me!
- Huh?

482
00:28:15,332 --> 00:28:17,132
Get off!

483
00:28:34,685 --> 00:28:38,590
Lab results are in.
Where've you been?

484
00:28:39,657 --> 00:28:41,659
Went to the high school.

485
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,233
What did you do?

486
00:28:50,501 --> 00:28:54,369
- Got Mateo to confess.
- You're kidding.

487
00:28:54,405 --> 00:28:57,175
Did you tell CPD or OFI?

488
00:28:58,676 --> 00:29:02,744
- I'm calling Hubbell.
- No, hold up, Chief. I...

489
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:06,518
I don't... I don't think
he did it.

490
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:10,451
He said he threw a match,
but wasn't it a chemical fire?

491
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:13,121
Yeah, they tested the residue.

492
00:29:13,157 --> 00:29:16,727
Calcium hypochlorite,
and polyethylene glycol.

493
00:29:19,831 --> 00:29:21,796
That's two chemicals
that ignite on contact.

494
00:29:21,832 --> 00:29:23,765
Why the hell is he talking
about lighting a match?

495
00:29:23,801 --> 00:29:25,366
I don't know, but why would
he confess

496
00:29:25,402 --> 00:29:27,072
to a crime he didn't
commit?

497
00:29:32,743 --> 00:29:35,477
This kid is damaged.

498
00:29:35,513 --> 00:29:38,546
The hell knows
what makes him tick.

499
00:29:38,582 --> 00:29:41,786
We don't even know
if it is a crime yet.

500
00:29:45,422 --> 00:29:47,291
Let's dig in.

501
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,329
Come on.

502
00:29:58,703 --> 00:30:00,134
What's all this?

503
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,737
OFI report on the school fire.

504
00:30:02,773 --> 00:30:04,472
They calling it arson?

505
00:30:04,508 --> 00:30:07,741
Just the lab results,
not a final determination.

506
00:30:07,777 --> 00:30:11,412
- Yeah, but we know it's arson.
- How?

507
00:30:11,448 --> 00:30:13,681
The fire was started with
chlorine and brake fluid.

508
00:30:13,717 --> 00:30:15,549
Any kid with access
to YouTube knows

509
00:30:15,585 --> 00:30:17,585
that that's a mixture
that blows up.

510
00:30:17,621 --> 00:30:19,121
Still, those chemicals could
have come

511
00:30:19,157 --> 00:30:21,155
into contact
accidentally.

512
00:30:21,191 --> 00:30:23,557
What's brake fluid doing
in a high school chemistry lab?

513
00:30:23,593 --> 00:30:25,427
You mean polyethylene glycol?

514
00:30:25,463 --> 00:30:28,296
Says here it has a lot
of laboratory uses.

515
00:30:28,332 --> 00:30:29,631
Chlorine is pretty common.

516
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:31,333
Yeah, but it's not
pure chlorine.

517
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:35,740
It's calcium hypochlorite,
that's pool chlorine.

518
00:30:36,908 --> 00:30:39,641
Like as in swimming pools?

519
00:30:39,677 --> 00:30:42,244
Yeah.

520
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,179
Huh.

521
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,885
This wasn't supposed to
happen, was it?

522
00:31:24,921 --> 00:31:26,790
What?

523
00:31:27,891 --> 00:31:30,325
One of the chemicals that
started the fire

524
00:31:30,361 --> 00:31:31,825
was pool chlorine,

525
00:31:31,861 --> 00:31:34,796
which you have access to
at your lifeguard job.

526
00:31:48,411 --> 00:31:50,881
It wasn't supposed
to get so big.

527
00:31:57,655 --> 00:32:01,760
I wanted a small fire
at Mateo's lab table.

528
00:32:05,295 --> 00:32:09,331
He's lit one before, so maybe
they kick him out of the school,

529
00:32:09,367 --> 00:32:12,303
and he couldn't push me around
anymore.

530
00:32:19,442 --> 00:32:21,445
It just exploded.

531
00:32:26,484 --> 00:32:28,482
I didn't know what to do.

532
00:32:28,518 --> 00:32:30,854
I-I tried to get everyone
out of there.

533
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:39,331
I wanted to tell you
in the cafeteria, but...

534
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:43,567
Mateo thought you were trying
to blame it on him.

535
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:29,413
I was so quick to make
assumptions about Mateo.

536
00:33:31,515 --> 00:33:32,881
I can understand why.

537
00:33:32,917 --> 00:33:34,848
If you hadn't insisted
this was arson,

538
00:33:34,884 --> 00:33:36,787
we might've missed
it altogether.

539
00:33:47,797 --> 00:33:50,801
That could've been Donna
in that room.

540
00:33:53,603 --> 00:33:56,805
Look, if I was...

541
00:33:56,841 --> 00:33:58,739
too bull-headed,

542
00:33:58,775 --> 00:34:00,909
not rational enough, then I'm...

543
00:34:00,945 --> 00:34:02,810
We get it, Chief.

544
00:34:02,846 --> 00:34:05,814
You did good.

545
00:34:14,825 --> 00:34:16,925
Didn't think I'd enjoy
the Muster this much.

546
00:34:16,961 --> 00:34:19,394
Yeah, winning is fun.

547
00:34:28,939 --> 00:34:31,673
Yeah, that's right.
Keep walking, McDowell.

548
00:34:31,709 --> 00:34:34,641
You gloating, Kidd? You only
beat us by half a step.

549
00:34:34,677 --> 00:34:36,811
Listen, I'll tell you what.

550
00:34:36,847 --> 00:34:38,912
Come to Molly's tonight,
I'll buy you a beer.

551
00:34:38,948 --> 00:34:42,416
- You know, help dull the pain.
- You're paying, I'll be there.

552
00:34:42,452 --> 00:34:43,854
Okay.

553
00:34:46,956 --> 00:34:51,492
See? I am a single, fun-loving
woman who can go out

554
00:34:51,528 --> 00:34:54,429
and sex up Chicago all I want.

555
00:34:54,465 --> 00:34:56,530
I'm not hung up on Severide
at all.

556
00:34:56,566 --> 00:34:58,499
You know if you keep
saying that, it means

557
00:34:58,535 --> 00:35:00,572
you're hung up on
him, right?

558
00:35:12,715 --> 00:35:15,816
Hey, what do you got
for us, Cruz?

559
00:35:15,852 --> 00:35:17,552
I got second place
in the dummy drag.

560
00:35:17,588 --> 00:35:18,853
Good job.

561
00:35:18,889 --> 00:35:21,722
Better than third, I guess.

562
00:35:21,758 --> 00:35:23,691
Mouch, I tried.
It's worth three points.

563
00:35:23,727 --> 00:35:26,994
Whoa, dummy drag?
I had you on pole hang!

564
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:31,132
Mouch, I don't want to do
what you say anymore.

565
00:35:31,168 --> 00:35:32,936
Finally.

566
00:35:34,905 --> 00:35:38,972
Look, Mouch, I love you,

567
00:35:39,008 --> 00:35:42,710
and I'm sorry that you
almost died because of me,

568
00:35:42,746 --> 00:35:44,478
but I can't keep this up.

569
00:35:44,514 --> 00:35:48,882
I can't keep doing everything
you say all of the time.

570
00:35:53,023 --> 00:35:57,624
Three points. That leaves us
12 points behind 87.

571
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,028
Ugh, tug-of-war's
only worth 10!

572
00:36:00,064 --> 00:36:04,865
So if nobody's doing the pole
hang, that's it! 1,000 bucks!

573
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:08,470
Look, Mouch. I didn't say
no one was doing the pole hang.

574
00:36:08,506 --> 00:36:11,576
- I just said I wasn't.
- Huh?

575
00:36:15,945 --> 00:36:17,911
Oh yeah!

576
00:36:17,947 --> 00:36:19,246
Okay.

577
00:36:19,282 --> 00:36:20,914
Brett!

578
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,749
- Brett!
- Yeah, Brett!

579
00:36:22,785 --> 00:36:24,985
- Hang in there, Brett!
- Come on! Hang in there!

580
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:27,688
Happy thoughts!
You got this!

581
00:36:27,724 --> 00:36:30,124
- This big guy's got nothing!
- He's sliding down!

582
00:36:40,236 --> 00:36:42,036
He's slipping, you're good!

583
00:36:42,072 --> 00:36:46,074
- Hang on!
- Go for the world record!

584
00:36:51,314 --> 00:36:53,548
Are you kidding me?

585
00:36:53,584 --> 00:36:56,617
Oh, my God! Oh God!

586
00:36:56,653 --> 00:36:59,753
Four more points
we can still beat 87!

587
00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:02,090
<i>Firehouses 51 and 87</i>

588
00:37:02,126 --> 00:37:04,224
<i>please report
to the tug-of-war arena.</i>

589
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,693
This is it! All the marbles!

590
00:37:06,729 --> 00:37:08,963
- Get done!
- Just go big!

591
00:37:08,999 --> 00:37:10,697
Come on!

592
00:37:15,238 --> 00:37:19,677
Oh, bad news, Mouch!

593
00:37:22,613 --> 00:37:24,711
- Nazarko?
- Our secret weapon.

594
00:37:24,747 --> 00:37:27,548
No, no, no, no.
He's not active duty.

595
00:37:27,584 --> 00:37:30,918
- He just had his stomach stapled!
- He's back at work next shift.

596
00:37:30,954 --> 00:37:33,954
The doc signed off.
Deal with it.

597
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:37,724
- We're done for.
- 'Scuse me.

598
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,594
Hey! Not so fast!

599
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:43,764
- Yeah!
- It is on now!

600
00:37:47,338 --> 00:37:49,336
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

601
00:37:49,372 --> 00:37:51,072
What are we waiting for?

602
00:37:51,108 --> 00:37:53,740
Yeah! Yes!

603
00:37:58,115 --> 00:38:02,316
- Come on 51!
- Dig! Come on, dig!

604
00:38:02,352 --> 00:38:04,121
Come on!

605
00:38:06,055 --> 00:38:07,691
Come on, 51!

606
00:38:29,345 --> 00:38:33,851
Hey, hey, hey.
You're off the hook.

607
00:38:35,985 --> 00:38:39,753
Listen, I know what it's like
when everybody

608
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:42,793
already has their mind made up
about you.

609
00:38:44,193 --> 00:38:48,131
Sometimes it's easier just
to let them think the worst.

610
00:38:51,367 --> 00:38:54,668
It doesn't have to be
like that.

611
00:38:54,704 --> 00:38:57,741
You decide who you are.
Not them.

612
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,909
But you can't go around
beating people up

613
00:39:01,945 --> 00:39:04,144
every time you feel
disrespected.

614
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,718
It'll take you down a dark road.
Trust me.

615
00:39:19,028 --> 00:39:21,898
You got a second chance here,
Mateo.

616
00:39:23,733 --> 00:39:25,969
Don't blow it.

617
00:39:37,814 --> 00:39:39,282
Yo!

618
00:39:41,751 --> 00:39:43,918
The teacher.

619
00:39:43,954 --> 00:39:46,189
Is she gonna make it?

620
00:39:47,925 --> 00:39:50,061
Things are looking up.

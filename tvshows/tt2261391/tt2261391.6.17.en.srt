1
00:00:00,461 --> 00:00:02,968
- Can you believe this?
- He got his sensation back.

2
00:00:03,031 --> 00:00:05,171
Whoa.

3
00:00:05,242 --> 00:00:07,576
<i>They will not even consider
reinstating Otis</i>

4
00:00:07,578 --> 00:00:10,646
until he completes two months rehab.

5
00:00:10,648 --> 00:00:13,148
Cordova, you're assigned
to Truck 81 going forward.

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,584
I didn't tell Casey yet,
but I need to say something.

7
00:00:15,586 --> 00:00:17,052
At least give me a couple of shifts

8
00:00:17,054 --> 00:00:18,854
to prove myself as a firefighter.

9
00:00:18,856 --> 00:00:20,589
Then you can tell him whatever you want.

10
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:24,488
- Trying to steal Otis' spot.
- It's not his spot anymore.

11
00:00:24,513 --> 00:00:26,174
And your boy's got no shot
taking it back from me

12
00:00:26,229 --> 00:00:28,533
when his knees are shaking
like a bowl of Jell-O.

13
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:29,984
Hey!

14
00:00:43,733 --> 00:00:45,032
Amazing.

15
00:00:45,101 --> 00:00:46,367
That's impressive range.

16
00:00:46,435 --> 00:00:48,074
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

17
00:00:48,104 --> 00:00:50,571
Marked improvement.

18
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:53,540
How much of that did you see?

19
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:55,362
What are you talking about?

20
00:00:55,457 --> 00:00:57,724
I heard you growling all the way to 51.

21
00:00:57,793 --> 00:00:58,759
Ah.

22
00:00:58,827 --> 00:01:01,995
Each day is like 200% progress.

23
00:01:02,064 --> 00:01:03,330
I don't doubt it.

24
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:06,533
You know, I'm optimistic
about my timeline.

25
00:01:06,602 --> 00:01:09,436
The surgeon says that
he's had Chicago Bulls players

26
00:01:09,505 --> 00:01:11,071
that haven't recovered as quickly as me.

27
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,007
So you gonna be
trying out for the Bulls now?

28
00:01:14,076 --> 00:01:17,411
No, no, but I'm gonna be
ready to jump back

29
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:19,346
into service as soon
as I get the sign-off.

30
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:25,719
Yeah, well, listen.

31
00:01:25,788 --> 00:01:28,188
Before that, the bullpen.

32
00:01:28,257 --> 00:01:29,723
It's understaffed and has been all year.

33
00:01:29,792 --> 00:01:32,192
And maybe instead of sitting at home

34
00:01:32,261 --> 00:01:35,529
you know, when you're
not doing your therapy,

35
00:01:35,597 --> 00:01:38,231
maybe you come on over to 51.

36
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,933
Pitch in.

37
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,969
Desk job?

38
00:01:43,038 --> 00:01:47,073
It would be really good to
have you around the firehouse.

39
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:51,778
A special favor to me.

40
00:01:56,285 --> 00:01:58,418
Anyway,

41
00:01:58,487 --> 00:02:00,554
you think about it. Let me know.

42
00:02:05,594 --> 00:02:08,395
So what do you think
about the new guy, Cordova?

43
00:02:08,464 --> 00:02:10,630
I think he's got to go.

44
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,799
- Really?
- Yep. Not a good fit.

45
00:02:12,868 --> 00:02:16,470
He's a little too cavalier
about taking Otis' spot.

46
00:02:16,538 --> 00:02:18,271
Can't keep worrying about Herrmann

47
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,140
punching him in the mouth.

48
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:21,942
- Again.
- Hm.

49
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,143
Why do you ask?

50
00:02:23,212 --> 00:02:25,345
Hm? Oh, I'm just curious.

51
00:02:25,414 --> 00:02:27,047
Okay.

52
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:33,720
Yuck.

53
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,755
First watch left it like this.

54
00:02:35,824 --> 00:02:37,157
Are you kidding me?

55
00:02:37,226 --> 00:02:39,092
- Who were the paramedics?
- Chout and Rafferty.

56
00:02:39,161 --> 00:02:40,927
They ducked out
before I could even sign in.

57
00:02:40,996 --> 00:02:43,296
Rafferty's texts are about to blow up.

58
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:44,464
Can't leave it like this.

59
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:46,099
Let's settle in.

60
00:02:46,168 --> 00:02:48,768
So our neighbors to the west,
Firehouse 19,

61
00:02:48,837 --> 00:02:50,203
they're out of service this morning

62
00:02:50,272 --> 00:02:51,538
due to a roach infestation.

63
00:02:51,607 --> 00:02:53,273
Oh, I've been there.

64
00:02:53,342 --> 00:02:54,641
19 is the worst.

65
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,109
Yeah, which means we ought to

66
00:02:56,178 --> 00:02:58,111
expect a very busy start.

67
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,352
- Hey! Otis in the firehouse!
- Hey, buddy.

68
00:03:10,225 --> 00:03:11,658
Welcome back, Otis.

69
00:03:11,727 --> 00:03:14,494
Everybody, Otis! Buddy.

70
00:03:17,232 --> 00:03:20,700
As per my request,
Otis has graciously agreed

71
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:23,169
to help out in the bullpen
while he recovers.

72
00:03:23,238 --> 00:03:24,471
Hey, good man.

73
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,739
So, any of you, you have any needs,

74
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:26,973
that's your man right there.

75
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:28,742
<i>Squad 3,</i>

76
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,810
<i>Truck 81, Ambulance 61,</i>

77
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,147
<i>electrical hazard, 423 South Laflin.</i>

78
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,816
Be back soon, buddy.

79
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:44,024
Let's go!

80
00:04:06,782 --> 00:04:08,181
What's the problem?

81
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,016
The scoreboard fell.

82
00:04:10,085 --> 00:04:11,952
People are in there
getting electrocuted!

83
00:04:12,035 --> 00:04:13,042
Let's go.

84
00:04:13,655 --> 00:04:16,152
Come here, sweetie. Come with us.

85
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:24,898
Hey! Don't!

86
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:33,461
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

87
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:35,537
Squad 3, use webbing
to reach the victims.

88
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:37,911
Kidd, Cordova, Mouch, get
these kids out of the pool.

89
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,579
Herrmann, you and me
find the utility closet.

90
00:04:39,648 --> 00:04:40,780
Get this power off.

91
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:42,215
Okay, let's go. Everyone out!

92
00:04:42,284 --> 00:04:44,317
The pool area is unsafe!

93
00:04:50,158 --> 00:04:51,925
Come on out of there.
Come out of the pool.

94
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:53,126
Come out. Come on, let's go.

95
00:04:53,195 --> 00:04:54,894
Come on, guys. Come on, guys.

96
00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:56,730
Let's get you out.

97
00:04:56,798 --> 00:04:59,666
Come on, swim towards me.

98
00:04:59,735 --> 00:05:01,401
Hey. Hey!

99
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,569
Hey! Come back!

100
00:05:02,638 --> 00:05:03,837
- In there.
- Come back!

101
00:05:03,905 --> 00:05:05,639
Come on, get back here!

102
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:11,344
Nope. Locked.

103
00:05:11,413 --> 00:05:12,445
Strike.

104
00:05:14,249 --> 00:05:15,915
- Come on!
- Keep paddling, keep paddling.

105
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:17,817
Get back here! Hey! Wha...

106
00:05:17,886 --> 00:05:20,120
Come on. There you go.

107
00:05:20,188 --> 00:05:21,421
There you go.

108
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,489
Pull!

109
00:05:25,994 --> 00:05:27,293
Okay, now follow the others.

110
00:05:27,362 --> 00:05:28,528
Good job.

111
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,106
Come on. Swim to me.

112
00:05:40,175 --> 00:05:42,008
Come on. I'm gonna get you safe.

113
00:05:42,077 --> 00:05:43,777
- Casey, hurry!
- Yeah!

114
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:45,812
We got a steel door locked tight.

115
00:05:47,616 --> 00:05:49,115
Hurry!

116
00:05:55,624 --> 00:05:57,524
- Got her?
- Yeah.

117
00:05:57,592 --> 00:05:58,725
Come on, kid.

118
00:05:58,794 --> 00:06:00,427
Help us out here, huh?

119
00:06:07,703 --> 00:06:09,135
- That's it.
- Shh, we got you.

120
00:06:09,204 --> 00:06:11,171
- Let's go.
- We got you. Come on.

121
00:06:21,316 --> 00:06:22,482
We got him.

122
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:24,184
- Come on.
- Here we go.

123
00:06:26,688 --> 00:06:28,688
Get your legs out!

124
00:06:30,058 --> 00:06:31,357
Come on.

125
00:06:42,704 --> 00:06:44,771
Good job, guys.

126
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,874
You okay?

127
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:04,424
- What's going on here?
- Electrocution.

128
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:06,459
We're just waiting for the all clear.

129
00:07:06,528 --> 00:07:09,262
Gregg Hill.
I didn't know you left the CFD?

130
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:11,097
Yeah, eight months ago.

131
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,866
- How is it?
- SAS?

132
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:14,033
It's incredible.

133
00:07:14,102 --> 00:07:15,702
Better pay, better insurance,

134
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:17,137
no 24-hour shifts.

135
00:07:17,205 --> 00:07:18,905
- Treat you like a human being.
- I used to work

136
00:07:18,974 --> 00:07:20,974
for the fire department in Dayton, Ohio.

137
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:23,877
Let me tell ya, go private,
you'll never look back.

138
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:25,712
Yeah, I have a life now.

139
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:27,380
Brett, Dawson.

140
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:28,448
Incoming.

141
00:07:31,052 --> 00:07:32,752
They both got zapped. They're still hot.

142
00:07:32,821 --> 00:07:33,953
- Grab some towels.
- Yep.

143
00:07:40,962 --> 00:07:43,129
Sinus tach. Sir, can you hear me?

144
00:07:43,198 --> 00:07:45,131
Thermal burns. Let's check his airway.

145
00:07:49,304 --> 00:07:51,404
- Airway's good.
- Lungs are clear. No stridor.

146
00:07:51,473 --> 00:07:52,939
Let's get her to Med.

147
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:12,926
Not sure if these are clean or dirty,

148
00:08:12,994 --> 00:08:14,327
but beggars can't be choosers.

149
00:08:14,396 --> 00:08:15,829
Thanks.

150
00:08:15,897 --> 00:08:16,963
Couldn't find anybody to tell us

151
00:08:17,032 --> 00:08:18,264
which bin was which.

152
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,833
Looks like the only two employees

153
00:08:19,901 --> 00:08:21,901
were the ones that got... zapped.

154
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:25,471
Been a long time since I
jumped in a pool fully clothed.

155
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,840
Oh, well, stick around.

156
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:29,008
We do this kind of thing all the time.

157
00:08:29,077 --> 00:08:31,177
All right.
Let's get this place locked up.

158
00:08:31,246 --> 00:08:33,279
Herrmann, make a sign
that says, "Pool closed."

159
00:08:33,348 --> 00:08:34,480
Yep.

160
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,349
Who does he belong to?

161
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:38,484
I assumed his mom
or somebody was out there.

162
00:08:38,553 --> 00:08:41,454
All the kids were claimed by parents.

163
00:08:41,523 --> 00:08:43,056
Hey, hon,

164
00:08:43,124 --> 00:08:45,692
are you here by yourself?

165
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,693
Yeah?

166
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:49,128
Aw. What's your name?

167
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,233
Okay, buddy.

168
00:08:53,301 --> 00:08:55,635
We need to get you back home.

169
00:08:55,704 --> 00:08:57,604
- You know where you live?
- No.

170
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,506
Okay.

171
00:09:01,877 --> 00:09:04,510
Let's take him back with us.
Maybe he'll open up.

172
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:07,180
I'll radio Boden. Bring him up to speed.

173
00:09:09,184 --> 00:09:11,551
Ever been in a firetruck?

174
00:09:12,921 --> 00:09:14,320
Mm-hmm.

175
00:09:17,893 --> 00:09:20,260
Connie. We got a child incoming.

176
00:09:20,328 --> 00:09:22,161
No parent or guardian
at the swimming pool.

177
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,598
I need to talk to Headquarters,
DCFS, and PD.

178
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:28,201
Phone numbers ASAP, please.

179
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:49,422
I hot-keyed
the emergency service numbers

180
00:09:49,491 --> 00:09:52,191
in my laptop a while back
for my podcast.

181
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,360
Anyway, those should be the numbers

182
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:56,195
- the Chief's looking for.
- Thank you.

183
00:09:56,264 --> 00:09:58,231
Yeah, I'll put the file on your Dropbox.

184
00:10:04,406 --> 00:10:06,072
That was fast.

185
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:14,213
Okay. Little Michael Phelps
in the house.

186
00:10:14,282 --> 00:10:17,083
Why don't we put him at DruAnn's desk?

187
00:10:17,152 --> 00:10:18,618
Okay. Come on.

188
00:10:21,623 --> 00:10:22,956
All right.

189
00:10:23,024 --> 00:10:24,991
Right here.

190
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,559
There we go.

191
00:10:26,628 --> 00:10:28,094
Do you like to color?

192
00:10:28,163 --> 00:10:31,264
CPD is sending someone over
to come and get him.

193
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,932
Said it could take a while.

194
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:34,567
But you'll be okay here,

195
00:10:34,636 --> 00:10:35,835
won't you, little man?

196
00:10:37,906 --> 00:10:39,639
- Thanks, Chief.
- You're welcome.

197
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:43,810
Okay. So you be good
for these nice people, okay?

198
00:10:43,878 --> 00:10:46,079
And if you need me or you get scared,

199
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:47,680
I'll just be right down the hall.

200
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:49,248
Okay? Okay.

201
00:10:56,858 --> 00:10:58,358
So, a little backstory,

202
00:10:58,426 --> 00:10:59,926
Cordova and I went on a few dates

203
00:10:59,995 --> 00:11:01,427
like a million years ago.

204
00:11:01,496 --> 00:11:02,595
- What?
- Yeah.

205
00:11:02,664 --> 00:11:04,130
And he's asking me not to say anything

206
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:05,999
so that Casey gives him a fair shake.

207
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:07,767
- What'd you say?
- Well, I mean, I...

208
00:11:07,836 --> 00:11:09,969
I was caught off-guard.
I haven't said anything yet.

209
00:11:10,038 --> 00:11:12,038
But it doesn't matter because Casey says

210
00:11:12,107 --> 00:11:13,373
Cordova's not working out.

211
00:11:13,441 --> 00:11:16,376
So, I'm thinking I just sit back,

212
00:11:16,444 --> 00:11:17,977
let this problem solve itself, you know?

213
00:11:18,046 --> 00:11:19,312
What do you think?

214
00:11:19,381 --> 00:11:21,781
- Mm. He's cute though.
- Yeah.

215
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,384
- Yes, but back to my question.
- I need more details.

216
00:11:24,452 --> 00:11:26,119
When you say a few dates,
what do you mean?

217
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:28,388
I mean, dinner and a movie
or leave your toothbrush

218
00:11:28,456 --> 00:11:29,789
at his place kind of thing?

219
00:11:29,858 --> 00:11:31,624
- Forget I said anything.
- Yo.

220
00:11:31,693 --> 00:11:34,394
Before you rush off, I wanted
to give you a couple of cards.

221
00:11:34,462 --> 00:11:35,962
You should really come down
to the Sherman offices

222
00:11:36,031 --> 00:11:37,296
- and hear their pitch.
- They're always

223
00:11:37,365 --> 00:11:38,965
interested in hiring great paramedics.

224
00:11:39,034 --> 00:11:40,700
I've never been treated better.

225
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:41,868
- Huh.
- Cool.

226
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:44,003
- Thanks, guys.
- All right.

227
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,213
You guys have an opinion
on Mike Whitting?

228
00:11:54,282 --> 00:11:57,316
Uh, he does a killer
Charlie Sheen impression.

229
00:11:57,385 --> 00:11:59,752
Good to know. How about Brian Kearns?

230
00:11:59,821 --> 00:12:02,288
He's... semi-cute.

231
00:12:03,158 --> 00:12:05,324
- Okay. How about Sean Turner?
- Oh.

232
00:12:05,393 --> 00:12:07,493
- Definition of a bummer.
- Yeah.

233
00:12:07,562 --> 00:12:09,595
- Ugh.
- What's this about, Casey?

234
00:12:09,664 --> 00:12:11,230
Looking to start
a new floater next shift.

235
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:12,432
These are our options.

236
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,500
I thought Cordova was staying.

237
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:17,036
Yeah, he doesn't play well with others.

238
00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:19,505
I saw that.

239
00:12:20,008 --> 00:12:23,176
Captain, um, those guys, they all stink.

240
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:26,179
So why don't we just hang
onto the one we got.

241
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:28,681
He's a smartass but you saw

242
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,683
how he jumped right
into that pool this morning.

243
00:12:30,752 --> 00:12:33,286
I would not say he jumped right in.

244
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:37,190
I jumped in first
and then he jumped after me.

245
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:39,358
- So...
- The point is...

246
00:12:39,427 --> 00:12:41,327
he seems competent.

247
00:12:43,898 --> 00:12:45,231
Fair enough.

248
00:12:48,203 --> 00:12:49,535
Lieutenant?

249
00:12:49,604 --> 00:12:51,204
- Yeah.
- You have a visitor

250
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:52,738
- on the apparatus floor.
- Cruz, I got a ton

251
00:12:52,807 --> 00:12:54,640
of paperwork here.
Can you just take care of it?

252
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:55,855
Actually, I can't.

253
00:12:55,957 --> 00:12:58,290
This is a VIP you're gonna want to see.

254
00:13:07,555 --> 00:13:08,888
Mom.

255
00:13:08,957 --> 00:13:10,156
- Hi.
- Hey.

256
00:13:15,063 --> 00:13:16,462
How are you?

257
00:13:16,531 --> 00:13:18,764
What... what are you doing in Chicago?

258
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,099
Moving in with you.

259
00:13:29,514 --> 00:13:31,519
- Um...
- Oh, get that look off your face.

260
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,091
It's just for a few weeks.

261
00:13:33,116 --> 00:13:35,036
No, really, what's this all about?

262
00:13:35,091 --> 00:13:36,353
What are you doing here?

263
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:38,433
Well, my church in St. Paul

264
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,925
is opening a sister church
here in Chicago,

265
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,911
and our pastor asked if I'd be willing
to help out with the books.

266
00:13:43,951 --> 00:13:45,232
What...

267
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,519
What about Chicago being "too toxic"?

268
00:13:47,588 --> 00:13:49,554
I've done a lot of thinking about that,

269
00:13:49,623 --> 00:13:53,325
and, yes, I left Chicago
a long time ago because...

270
00:13:53,394 --> 00:13:54,993
it was too fast for me.

271
00:13:55,062 --> 00:13:56,428
But you know what?

272
00:13:56,497 --> 00:13:59,064
The Bible says "Do not let
your heart be troubled,

273
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:01,099
and do not be afraid."

274
00:14:01,168 --> 00:14:03,192
So here I am.

275
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,770
Untroubled and unafraid.

276
00:14:04,838 --> 00:14:05,871
Come here.

277
00:14:07,574 --> 00:14:08,840
Okay?

278
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:10,876
Well, whatever the good book says

279
00:14:10,944 --> 00:14:12,511
to get you here,
that's good enough for me.

280
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:14,227
Although you could've called me

281
00:14:14,258 --> 00:14:15,347
and told me that you were coming.

282
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,015
It all happened so fast, and, um...

283
00:14:17,084 --> 00:14:19,518
Okay, well, you can stay
with us as long as you want.

284
00:14:19,586 --> 00:14:21,468
- Us?
- Us, yeah.

285
00:14:21,531 --> 00:14:26,267
Uh, actually, Mom, this is Stella Kidd.

286
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:27,502
- Hi.
- She's my roommate.

287
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,505
Very nice to meet you. Okay, hi.

288
00:14:30,573 --> 00:14:33,307
- Roommate?
- Yeah, yeah, uh.

289
00:14:33,376 --> 00:14:35,309
She's a firefighter here at 51.

290
00:14:35,378 --> 00:14:37,111
Oh. Okay.

291
00:14:38,281 --> 00:14:40,448
It's a different world.

292
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:42,717
- Yeah, it really is.
- Yeah.

293
00:14:42,786 --> 00:14:45,686
Anyway, um, we have plenty of room.

294
00:14:45,755 --> 00:14:46,954
So you should be fine.

295
00:14:47,023 --> 00:14:48,956
- Is this...
- Yes, yes, this is me.

296
00:14:49,025 --> 00:14:50,291
- I travel light.
- Oh.

297
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,659
Okay, well, welcome.

298
00:14:51,728 --> 00:14:52,960
- I...
- And come in.

299
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:54,295
Thanks.

300
00:14:54,364 --> 00:14:56,664
So...

301
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,303
First shift's washing it.

302
00:15:02,372 --> 00:15:03,437
Hey.

303
00:15:03,807 --> 00:15:05,306
How're the lifeguard and the other guy?

304
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,641
They make it to Med alive?

305
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:07,975
Yeah, actually. They got some burns.

306
00:15:08,044 --> 00:15:09,844
But looks like they're gonna make it.

307
00:15:12,482 --> 00:15:13,981
Well, that's great.

308
00:15:14,684 --> 00:15:16,584
Oh, my God, he still
has a thing for you.

309
00:15:16,653 --> 00:15:17,985
What? Don't be absurd.

310
00:15:18,054 --> 00:15:19,654
He's looking at you
like you're the only one

311
00:15:19,722 --> 00:15:21,088
in the Firehouse.

312
00:15:21,157 --> 00:15:23,424
- Just telling you what I saw.
- Ridiculous.

313
00:15:23,493 --> 00:15:24,492
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

314
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:25,660
Whether he knows it or not,

315
00:15:25,728 --> 00:15:27,728
he's got one foot out the door.

316
00:15:38,508 --> 00:15:40,041
What are you coloring?

317
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,310
Mister Doggy.

318
00:15:43,012 --> 00:15:44,245
Let me see.

319
00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:50,251
Ooh, good choice, using purple.

320
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:05,199
Hey, what's that?

321
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:06,434
Dog house.

322
00:16:06,502 --> 00:16:07,802
Hm. And that?

323
00:16:07,871 --> 00:16:09,937
- Flower.
- Hm.

324
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,106
You're smart.

325
00:16:13,543 --> 00:16:15,076
What's your name?

326
00:16:15,144 --> 00:16:16,577
Zee.

327
00:16:17,547 --> 00:16:19,213
Your full name?

328
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:20,648
Xander.

329
00:16:20,717 --> 00:16:22,650
Hm, and what's your last name?

330
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:23,784
Barlow.

331
00:16:23,853 --> 00:16:26,621
Hey. Can you spell that?

332
00:16:32,328 --> 00:16:34,595
That's very good.

333
00:16:34,664 --> 00:16:36,564
What are your parents' names?

334
00:16:36,633 --> 00:16:39,066
Franklin and Mommy.

335
00:16:39,135 --> 00:16:42,136
Ah, Franklin Barlow is your dad?

336
00:16:44,073 --> 00:16:45,172
What's that?

337
00:16:45,241 --> 00:16:46,289
Bone.

338
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,770
What street do you live on?

339
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:50,578
Grenshaw.

340
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:52,079
Grenshaw?

341
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:54,448
Okay.

342
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,325
Hey, Chief.

343
00:17:05,528 --> 00:17:06,627
This is Xander Barlow.

344
00:17:06,696 --> 00:17:07,862
His father Franklin Barlow

345
00:17:07,931 --> 00:17:09,797
lives at 841 S. Grenshaw.

346
00:17:09,866 --> 00:17:12,667
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm and his phone number.

347
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,636
That's great news.

348
00:17:16,873 --> 00:17:19,240
Then call him. Tell him
to come pick up his boy.

349
00:17:20,276 --> 00:17:22,076
That sound good, Xander?

350
00:17:23,379 --> 00:17:24,679
Huh.

351
00:17:30,453 --> 00:17:31,786
So how is St. Paul?

352
00:17:31,854 --> 00:17:33,321
Well, there's two seasons:

353
00:17:33,389 --> 00:17:34,956
winter and August 5th.

354
00:17:35,024 --> 00:17:36,891
But I like it. My speed.

355
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,460
Hey, tell us something
about Severide we don't know.

356
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:41,128
You don't have to do that.

357
00:17:41,197 --> 00:17:45,299
Well, did he tell you where
the name Kelly comes from?

358
00:17:45,368 --> 00:17:46,968
When he was in high school he said

359
00:17:47,036 --> 00:17:48,970
he was named after Machine Gun Kelly,

360
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:51,172
which I'm sure his father encouraged.

361
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,975
But actually Kelly is named
after my father,

362
00:17:54,043 --> 00:17:55,643
- John Kelly Sheridan.
- Well, that's great.

363
00:17:55,712 --> 00:17:58,679
You could have named him Kelly
if he was a boy or a girl.

364
00:17:58,748 --> 00:18:01,983
You know?

365
00:18:02,051 --> 00:18:05,219
Well, 'cause the name Kelly,
it... it can be...

366
00:18:05,288 --> 00:18:07,488
a girl's, um...

367
00:18:07,557 --> 00:18:10,491
But he's not, you know.
He's obviously not.

368
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,927
What is, um... Chief!

369
00:18:12,996 --> 00:18:14,562
It's... what is that word?

370
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,665
Are my eyes deceiving me?
Is that Jennifer Severide?

371
00:18:17,734 --> 00:18:20,167
Well, it's back to Sheridan,
but your eyes are fine.

372
00:18:20,236 --> 00:18:22,536
- How are you, Wallace?
- I'm great.

373
00:18:22,605 --> 00:18:25,172
Good to see you. You look well.

374
00:18:25,241 --> 00:18:26,340
You too.

375
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:28,275
Sorry to interrupt. Lieutenant.

376
00:18:28,344 --> 00:18:30,745
Mind coming over to check the
maintenance list on the rig?

377
00:18:30,813 --> 00:18:32,246
Yeah, no problem.

378
00:18:34,884 --> 00:18:38,386
You know, lots of names
can be masculine and feminine.

379
00:18:38,454 --> 00:18:40,354
Uh, like,

380
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:41,455
- uh...
- Chris.

381
00:18:41,524 --> 00:18:43,257
Yes! You see?

382
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:45,192
It's Christopher.

383
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:49,530
Um, I...

384
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:53,501
I got to go. Uh, got to go do something.

385
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,405
So, um, do you ever see Kelly's father?

386
00:18:57,473 --> 00:18:58,639
Yeah, occasionally.

387
00:18:58,708 --> 00:18:59,940
Yeah, how's he look?

388
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:01,976
Well, you know,

389
00:19:02,045 --> 00:19:03,411
- same old Benny.
- Mm.

390
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:05,880
- Yeah, that's what I figured.
- Excuse me.

391
00:19:05,948 --> 00:19:07,415
Yes, sir, what can I do you for?

392
00:19:07,483 --> 00:19:09,784
Uh, my son is here.

393
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,457
- There he is!
- Dad!

394
00:19:16,526 --> 00:19:18,125
Oh!

395
00:19:18,194 --> 00:19:20,394
You had me about scared to death, buddy.

396
00:19:22,131 --> 00:19:23,397
Thank you.

397
00:19:23,466 --> 00:19:24,732
Oh, you're welcome.

398
00:19:24,801 --> 00:19:27,468
Aw, I missed you so much.

399
00:19:27,537 --> 00:19:29,470
I'm glad you're okay.

400
00:19:31,908 --> 00:19:35,643
That AED monitor they had is
worth more than our whole rig.

401
00:19:35,711 --> 00:19:37,078
It's weird seeing Gregg Hill

402
00:19:37,146 --> 00:19:39,080
working for a private ambulance company.

403
00:19:39,148 --> 00:19:41,348
I hear that's
the new normal for the CFD.

404
00:19:41,417 --> 00:19:43,517
Just farm out surge work to contractors.

405
00:19:43,586 --> 00:19:44,819
Yeah, I remember him.

406
00:19:44,887 --> 00:19:46,320
He used to be at 31. He's a smart guy.

407
00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:49,156
That SAS ambulance looked pretty nice.

408
00:19:49,225 --> 00:19:50,691
And he gave us their card.

409
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,294
Said we should come down
some time and hear a pitch.

410
00:19:56,165 --> 00:19:59,467
Well, your mom hates me.

411
00:19:59,535 --> 00:20:01,168
Uh.

412
00:20:01,237 --> 00:20:03,804
- No chance.
- Mm. She does.

413
00:20:03,873 --> 00:20:06,907
She's a saint. She doesn't hate anyone.

414
00:20:09,278 --> 00:20:10,945
Whatever you say.

415
00:20:11,013 --> 00:20:14,148
Uh, but, uh, you're wrong.

416
00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:22,189
Thanks.

417
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:27,695
You know, it's not so bad
working in the bullpen.

418
00:20:27,763 --> 00:20:30,798
- Yeah?
- Yeah, maybe...

419
00:20:30,867 --> 00:20:32,533
I can come back tomorrow.

420
00:20:32,602 --> 00:20:35,603
Yeah.

421
00:20:37,306 --> 00:20:39,640
- Are you the Chief here?
- Yes, ma'am.

422
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:41,208
I understand you have my boy.

423
00:20:41,277 --> 00:20:43,244
Um, I went to the pool to pick him up,

424
00:20:43,312 --> 00:20:45,412
and someone said they
saw the firetruck take him.

425
00:20:45,481 --> 00:20:47,148
- I'm sorry...
- My boy, Xander!

426
00:20:47,216 --> 00:20:48,916
- Where is he?
- Yeah, um,

427
00:20:48,985 --> 00:20:52,419
sorry for the confusion,
but your husband came by.

428
00:20:52,488 --> 00:20:53,821
You mean his father?

429
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,289
Yes.

430
00:20:55,925 --> 00:20:58,058
You didn't hand Zee to him?

431
00:20:58,127 --> 00:20:59,760
I'm sorry, ma'am,
we're a little confused...

432
00:20:59,829 --> 00:21:01,495
He doesn't have custody!

433
00:21:01,564 --> 00:21:04,999
He's a lunatic, and you just
hand over my child to him?

434
00:21:05,067 --> 00:21:06,834
What gives you the right?

435
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,357
You would let a child go

436
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,572
with someone... you don't even know

437
00:21:19,597 --> 00:21:22,291
if they had custody or not.
You just let him walk out.

438
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,308
He could have gotten seriously hurt.

439
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,490
Hey.

440
00:21:25,515 --> 00:21:28,383
Apparently Zee's aunt
picked him up from the father.

441
00:21:28,428 --> 00:21:30,549
He's at home now, so the boy's
safety is not in question.

442
00:21:30,587 --> 00:21:31,854
I feel terrible.

443
00:21:31,894 --> 00:21:33,827
I shoulder the blame, Otis.

444
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:36,166
I gave the go ahead to hand him
over to his father.

445
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:38,825
No, Chief. This was my idea.

446
00:21:38,894 --> 00:21:40,760
Ma'am. Ma'am.

447
00:21:41,563 --> 00:21:43,396
- I'm so sorry...
- I don't want to hear it.

448
00:21:43,465 --> 00:21:45,732
I'm gonna go home and see if my son

449
00:21:45,801 --> 00:21:47,200
isn't completely traumatized

450
00:21:47,269 --> 00:21:50,637
by this firehouse's irresponsibility.

451
00:21:50,705 --> 00:21:52,839
Maybe if you hadn't left
your kindergartner at the pool

452
00:21:52,908 --> 00:21:55,008
like it was a damn day care center.

453
00:21:56,645 --> 00:21:58,411
This was a bad idea.

454
00:22:11,827 --> 00:22:13,193
Hey, Mom, you can take my room.

455
00:22:13,261 --> 00:22:14,594
I'll sleep on the couch.

456
00:22:14,663 --> 00:22:15,995
For a month?

457
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,764
Well, I was gonna offer him my room,

458
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:22,001
but he gets shy when he sees
the bras on the shower rod.

459
00:22:23,338 --> 00:22:25,772
Um, can you point me in
the direction of your bathroom?

460
00:22:25,841 --> 00:22:26,873
Yeah, it's right there.

461
00:22:26,942 --> 00:22:28,708
- Oh, okay.
- Um.

462
00:22:28,777 --> 00:22:30,443
Do you...

463
00:22:30,512 --> 00:22:32,245
Okay.

464
00:22:36,718 --> 00:22:38,218
You see?

465
00:22:38,286 --> 00:22:40,420
- Hates.
- What?

466
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:41,554
Relax.

467
00:22:41,623 --> 00:22:43,256
She's just a little old-fashioned.

468
00:22:43,325 --> 00:22:47,527
Oh, so I suppose you're not
gonna tell her about...

469
00:22:48,697 --> 00:22:51,631
whatever this is we got going on.

470
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,466
Look.

471
00:22:53,535 --> 00:22:55,301
She went through a rough patch
a long time ago,

472
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,704
and ever since she's made
her life about caution.

473
00:22:57,772 --> 00:22:59,772
So I say that we...

474
00:22:59,841 --> 00:23:03,142
when I say we, I mean you...
just give it a second

475
00:23:03,211 --> 00:23:04,777
to let it breathe instead of trying

476
00:23:04,846 --> 00:23:06,579
to become instant friends.

477
00:23:06,648 --> 00:23:09,082
Okay.

478
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:13,353
But what is it, exactly,
that we got going on?

479
00:23:15,457 --> 00:23:16,990
Uh.

480
00:23:17,058 --> 00:23:19,526
It's none of my mom's business.

481
00:23:20,896 --> 00:23:22,228
Uh, Mom, you want some coffee?

482
00:23:22,297 --> 00:23:23,630
Yeah, that'd be great.

483
00:23:30,438 --> 00:23:34,107
So, Jennifer...

484
00:23:34,175 --> 00:23:37,610
Tell me about this church
that you're opening up.

485
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,445
Oh, well, um,

486
00:23:39,514 --> 00:23:42,115
a couple from our congregation
moved back here

487
00:23:42,183 --> 00:23:43,850
and thought there was a real need

488
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,451
for some fellowship in Old Town.

489
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,120
- Oh, I used to live there.
- Hm.

490
00:23:47,188 --> 00:23:48,955
Yeah, I mean, that couple's right.

491
00:23:49,024 --> 00:23:51,591
The neighborhood could use
some fellowship.

492
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,126
That's what I told our pastor.

493
00:23:53,194 --> 00:23:54,994
- Mm-hmm.
- If I could come to town

494
00:23:55,063 --> 00:23:56,796
and set them up with QuickBooks

495
00:23:56,865 --> 00:24:00,567
to, um, you know, just get them
on their feet.

496
00:24:05,974 --> 00:24:09,008
This mother seem satisfied
at all she got her son back?

497
00:24:09,077 --> 00:24:10,777
I mean, that's the important thing.

498
00:24:10,845 --> 00:24:12,178
Not by a long shot.

499
00:24:12,247 --> 00:24:14,013
Lawsuit. You watch.

500
00:24:14,082 --> 00:24:15,782
Nothing will surprise me anymore.

501
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,685
- I just feel bad for Otis.
- It wasn't his fault.

502
00:24:21,556 --> 00:24:23,590
Yo! Cordova.

503
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:26,526
I heard this is where 51 hangs out.

504
00:24:26,595 --> 00:24:28,494
It is. Glad you could make it.

505
00:24:28,563 --> 00:24:30,964
- Let me buy you a drink.
- Oh, thanks, Captain.

506
00:24:31,032 --> 00:24:33,633
Hey, I've been meaning to
compliment you on how quickly

507
00:24:33,702 --> 00:24:35,368
you've fallen into step
with the rest of the crew.

508
00:24:35,437 --> 00:24:37,036
Everyone's been saying good things.

509
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,174
- Really?
- Is that Jake Cordova?

510
00:24:41,242 --> 00:24:43,343
Reimers. You still at 93's house?

511
00:24:43,411 --> 00:24:45,511
I thought you didn't come to Molly's.

512
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,880
- Oh, I live across town...
- No, no, that's not it.

513
00:24:47,949 --> 00:24:49,682
You said you didn't come here

514
00:24:49,751 --> 00:24:52,585
'cause you used to bang one
of the owners.

515
00:25:07,102 --> 00:25:09,369
We dated a nanosecond like a decade ago,

516
00:25:09,437 --> 00:25:11,170
and I didn't want you
to have a bad impression

517
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:12,872
before he had a chance
to establish himself.

518
00:25:12,941 --> 00:25:14,540
So I didn't say anything.

519
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:16,275
And then you said that you were
getting rid of him.

520
00:25:16,344 --> 00:25:17,777
How long was a nanosecond?

521
00:25:17,846 --> 00:25:21,381
Like... like noth... a few weeks.
I don't even remember.

522
00:25:21,449 --> 00:25:23,883
Babe, please, just put yourself
in my shoes.

523
00:25:23,952 --> 00:25:25,418
Put yourself in mine.

524
00:25:25,487 --> 00:25:26,719
You really think I'm gonna ding a guy

525
00:25:26,788 --> 00:25:28,087
just because of something happened

526
00:25:28,156 --> 00:25:29,255
before I even knew you.

527
00:25:29,324 --> 00:25:30,356
I just don't understand

528
00:25:30,425 --> 00:25:32,191
why you didn't tell me.

529
00:25:35,263 --> 00:25:37,597
- I'm heading home.
- Matt.

530
00:25:52,743 --> 00:25:54,914
Hey. How's Otis?

531
00:25:54,983 --> 00:25:57,083
He didn't come out
for breakfast this morning.

532
00:25:57,152 --> 00:25:58,718
I talked to him for just a second.

533
00:25:58,787 --> 00:26:01,087
He's beating himself up pretty
hard about the whole thing.

534
00:26:01,156 --> 00:26:03,256
Yeah, I figured.

535
00:26:03,324 --> 00:26:05,591
I'll call him from my desk.

536
00:26:10,231 --> 00:26:11,597
You sure everything's all right?

537
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:13,933
I'm sure.

538
00:26:14,002 --> 00:26:16,302
Okay.

539
00:26:29,284 --> 00:26:31,951
Thank you so much for letting
me borrow the car.

540
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,486
Yeah, sure. Where you headed?

541
00:26:33,555 --> 00:26:35,154
Uh.

542
00:26:37,525 --> 00:26:40,293
Well, I'm going to have coffee
with your father.

543
00:26:40,361 --> 00:26:42,328
Now, before you say anything,

544
00:26:42,397 --> 00:26:45,298
or ask for the keys back,
just hear me out.

545
00:26:46,668 --> 00:26:49,001
I need to see him to look into his eyes.

546
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,137
I want him to know he didn't break me.

547
00:26:59,914 --> 00:27:01,481
I think it's a good idea.

548
00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:02,648
You do?

549
00:27:02,717 --> 00:27:04,517
Yeah, I think it'll do you good.

550
00:27:04,586 --> 00:27:06,319
And I know you can handle it.

551
00:27:06,387 --> 00:27:08,888
I've never seen you stronger.

552
00:27:13,261 --> 00:27:15,661
Mm. Thank you.

553
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:19,165
Uh, how long has it been
since you've last seen him?

554
00:27:19,234 --> 00:27:22,869
Oh, a long, long time.

555
00:27:24,172 --> 00:27:26,839
Well, hey, let him have it.

556
00:27:26,908 --> 00:27:29,909
I will.

557
00:27:29,978 --> 00:27:32,812
You two be safe.

558
00:27:34,349 --> 00:27:36,315
Did you hear that?

559
00:27:36,384 --> 00:27:38,351
She said you two... be safe.

560
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:40,686
- Yeah. Yeah, I heard it.
- You two, like me.

561
00:27:40,755 --> 00:27:41,788
I heard it.

562
00:27:46,661 --> 00:27:48,361
Hey, Captain.

563
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:49,896
I feel like I need explain.

564
00:27:49,964 --> 00:27:52,431
I never meant to put anyone
in an uncomfortable position.

565
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,901
It was a long time ago. I don't care.

566
00:27:54,969 --> 00:27:57,870
Gabby's my wife now, and I'm your boss.

567
00:27:57,939 --> 00:28:00,206
It's not gonna get in the way of my job.

568
00:28:00,275 --> 00:28:02,909
So it better not get
in the way of yours.

569
00:28:02,977 --> 00:28:04,544
No, of course not.

570
00:28:05,246 --> 00:28:06,579
Good.

571
00:28:10,518 --> 00:28:12,752
I'm gonna get some coffee.

572
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:25,031
Wallace.

573
00:28:25,099 --> 00:28:26,732
Ugh, don't tell me.

574
00:28:26,801 --> 00:28:28,901
This is about the boy
we gave to the wrong parent.

575
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:31,370
- You're right about that.
- Is the mom suing the CFD?

576
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:32,738
Worse, she's threatening to go

577
00:28:32,807 --> 00:28:34,273
straight to the news channels.

578
00:28:34,342 --> 00:28:35,741
She's not waiting for lawyers.

579
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:37,310
She says she's on TV tonight.

580
00:28:37,378 --> 00:28:39,579
Or we cut her a check.

581
00:28:39,647 --> 00:28:41,414
And I promise you, Wallace,

582
00:28:41,482 --> 00:28:43,416
this isn't gonna be on me.

583
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,482
Ma'am, ju... just one moment, please.

584
00:29:21,984 --> 00:29:23,350
I just want to apologize.

585
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:25,119
It wasn't the CFD's fault.

586
00:29:31,127 --> 00:29:34,194
It wasn't the CFD's fault
we let Xander go home

587
00:29:34,263 --> 00:29:36,230
with his father. It was mine.

588
00:29:36,298 --> 00:29:37,831
I, uh...

589
00:29:39,335 --> 00:29:41,668
I was recently injured at work

590
00:29:41,737 --> 00:29:43,470
and, uh,

591
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:46,206
I wanted so badly to prove to my Chief

592
00:29:46,275 --> 00:29:48,475
I wasn't useless.

593
00:29:48,591 --> 00:29:51,051
And so in my haste to matter,

594
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,686
I guess I acted too quickly

595
00:29:52,755 --> 00:29:55,589
in letting Zee go home
with someone who I thought

596
00:29:55,658 --> 00:29:58,358
looked like a loving parent.

597
00:29:58,427 --> 00:30:00,275
Again,

598
00:30:00,346 --> 00:30:02,480
I sincerely apologize.

599
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,975
Got it.

600
00:30:39,819 --> 00:30:41,152
Hey, it's me again.

601
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,654
That little stick figure family decal,
that looks brand new.

602
00:30:43,723 --> 00:30:45,856
- I think you'd better leave.
- Yeah, I thought Z's dad,

603
00:30:45,925 --> 00:30:48,159
- he was out of the picture.
- I said leave.

604
00:30:48,227 --> 00:30:49,827
Are you scamming us?

605
00:30:49,896 --> 00:30:51,195
What's wrong, baby?

606
00:30:51,264 --> 00:30:52,763
Yep.

607
00:30:52,832 --> 00:30:54,432
You're scamming us.

608
00:30:58,371 --> 00:31:00,037
Dad!

609
00:31:00,106 --> 00:31:01,672
I say let's get ahead of this,

610
00:31:01,741 --> 00:31:02,873
but I don't think there's any

611
00:31:02,942 --> 00:31:04,342
getting out in front of anything.

612
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,876
Speaking on behalf
of the mayor's office,

613
00:31:05,945 --> 00:31:07,178
we can afford a settlement

614
00:31:07,246 --> 00:31:08,179
more than we can afford

615
00:31:08,247 --> 00:31:09,213
the 24-hour news cycle

616
00:31:09,282 --> 00:31:10,514
going for our jugulars.

617
00:31:10,583 --> 00:31:12,083
What are you saying, Ms. Simmons?

618
00:31:12,151 --> 00:31:14,452
We make her an offer,
and we make this go away.

619
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,021
That won't be necessary.

620
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:18,289
Otis.

621
00:31:18,358 --> 00:31:20,191
I'm not sure this is the time.

622
00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:21,559
They're scam artists.

623
00:31:21,627 --> 00:31:24,362
- Who is?
- The mother and father.

624
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:27,231
They cooked it up after the dad
picked up the boy.

625
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,632
It's like a slip and fall.

626
00:31:28,701 --> 00:31:30,468
They just... they thought
they could milk

627
00:31:30,536 --> 00:31:32,570
some easy money out of the city.

628
00:31:36,776 --> 00:31:38,776
Do not give these people a dime.

629
00:31:38,845 --> 00:31:40,411
You don't have to tell me.

630
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,046
Send me that photo.

631
00:31:42,115 --> 00:31:43,614
Gentlemen.

632
00:31:47,954 --> 00:31:49,920
Thanks.

633
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:53,991
My mom used to say that if there was

634
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,593
a puddle outside, I'd find it.

635
00:31:55,661 --> 00:31:56,927
If she put white on me, it wouldn't

636
00:31:56,996 --> 00:31:59,430
stay white very long.

637
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,067
I don't know why I can't seem
to go a week

638
00:32:03,136 --> 00:32:05,770
without stepping into some 51 drama.

639
00:32:06,572 --> 00:32:07,905
That's every workplace.

640
00:32:07,974 --> 00:32:09,407
You put three people in an office,

641
00:32:09,475 --> 00:32:11,075
there's gonna be office politics.

642
00:32:11,144 --> 00:32:14,245
Yeah, but I go home
with one of the bosses.

643
00:32:14,313 --> 00:32:16,580
This will blow over.

644
00:32:16,649 --> 00:32:18,783
Maybe I should give SAS some thought.

645
00:32:18,851 --> 00:32:20,918
You know, just...

646
00:32:20,987 --> 00:32:22,520
just draw a separation line.

647
00:32:22,588 --> 00:32:24,355
This is work. This is personal.

648
00:32:24,424 --> 00:32:25,890
Nice and clean.

649
00:32:26,526 --> 00:32:28,659
You don't mean that.

650
00:32:28,728 --> 00:32:30,728
You love the CFD.

651
00:32:33,866 --> 00:32:36,534
<i>Ambulance 61.</i>

652
00:32:36,602 --> 00:32:38,636
It wouldn't be the worst
thing to hear them out.

653
00:32:38,704 --> 00:32:41,105
<i>Man down from unknown causes.</i>

654
00:33:03,763 --> 00:33:05,463
I'll call a second ambo.

655
00:33:09,569 --> 00:33:11,168
Oh, good.

656
00:33:16,709 --> 00:33:19,076
Hey, buddy. What's your name?

657
00:33:19,145 --> 00:33:20,578
- Savion.
- What happened?

658
00:33:20,646 --> 00:33:22,546
You and your friend having a duel?

659
00:33:22,615 --> 00:33:24,148
Screw that punk.

660
00:33:24,217 --> 00:33:27,251
All right, one to the chest,
one to the abdomen.

661
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,586
No exit wound.

662
00:33:28,654 --> 00:33:30,554
- Pulse is weak.
- Good.

663
00:33:30,623 --> 00:33:32,056
- Hey!
- Fix me.

664
00:33:32,081 --> 00:33:33,034
Not him.

665
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:35,292
I can't move my damn legs.

666
00:33:36,662 --> 00:33:39,096
Oh, not what we thought it was.

667
00:33:39,165 --> 00:33:40,664
- What the hell does that mean?
- We thought this call

668
00:33:40,733 --> 00:33:42,099
was from a couple blocks over.

669
00:33:42,168 --> 00:33:43,734
We're not allowed to take
high-risk patients.

670
00:33:43,803 --> 00:33:45,503
High-risk for what?

671
00:33:45,571 --> 00:33:47,037
No insurance.

672
00:33:48,207 --> 00:33:49,840
Well, look, there's two of you, so...

673
00:33:49,909 --> 00:33:51,275
Hey! You can't just leave us here.

674
00:33:51,344 --> 00:33:53,511
- We have multiple victims.
- It's not our choice.

675
00:33:53,536 --> 00:33:54,555
It's company mandate.

676
00:33:57,283 --> 00:33:58,516
Dawson!

677
00:34:00,019 --> 00:34:04,188
Need a 10-1 to 257 W. Kamerling Ave.

678
00:34:04,257 --> 00:34:06,690
We got an active shooter situation.

679
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:07,858
Yeah!

680
00:34:23,438 --> 00:34:25,242
Yeah! Yeah!

681
00:34:25,266 --> 00:34:26,432
Hey, do you want to die?

682
00:34:26,434 --> 00:34:27,788
You got to hold still, okay?

683
00:34:27,813 --> 00:34:29,245
So I can bandage you to make it
to the hospital.

684
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:57,440
Hold your fire!

685
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:59,012
We're trying to help you guy...

686
00:34:59,081 --> 00:35:00,146
Get out of here!

687
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:03,583
Hold your fire!

688
00:35:03,652 --> 00:35:06,653
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

689
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:11,633
You okay? We heard the 10-1.

690
00:35:11,704 --> 00:35:13,904
- Beat the cops here.
- Of course.

691
00:35:13,973 --> 00:35:15,472
Multiple gunshot victims.

692
00:35:15,541 --> 00:35:17,174
This guy was pretty mouthy
before he passed out.

693
00:35:17,243 --> 00:35:18,542
But his pulse is strong.

694
00:35:18,611 --> 00:35:19,858
My guy's not so lucky.

695
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,079
ETA on another ambulance
is like five minutes.

696
00:35:22,148 --> 00:35:23,680
Okay, load them both in the 61.

697
00:35:23,749 --> 00:35:25,516
- Cordova, help the medics.
- Yeah.

698
00:35:25,584 --> 00:35:27,251
We'll meet you at the hospital.

699
00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:29,520
Come on, come on.

700
00:35:44,236 --> 00:35:46,303
Right on time as usual.

701
00:35:55,014 --> 00:35:57,281
Both GSWs are gonna make it.

702
00:35:57,349 --> 00:35:59,349
- Really?
- That's what Dr. Choi said.

703
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:01,418
- Both men are stable.
- Oh.

704
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:08,125
How's your insurance, ma'am?

705
00:36:08,194 --> 00:36:10,294
- You all paid up?
- Excuse me?

706
00:36:10,362 --> 00:36:12,262
You know, I've been thinking
about your offer

707
00:36:12,331 --> 00:36:14,865
- to come over and work private.
- Mm-hmm.

708
00:36:14,934 --> 00:36:17,701
I'm gonna go ahead and pass.

709
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,969
Me too.

710
00:36:28,047 --> 00:36:29,580
Hey, Mom.

711
00:36:29,648 --> 00:36:31,882
You want to grab breakfast
with Stella and me?

712
00:36:31,951 --> 00:36:33,383
I'm buying.

713
00:36:33,886 --> 00:36:35,152
Oh, hey, Champ.

714
00:36:37,579 --> 00:36:38,532
Hi.

715
00:36:38,557 --> 00:36:40,257
Hey, honey. Guess what?

716
00:36:41,894 --> 00:36:44,094
We're getting back together.

717
00:36:52,137 --> 00:36:53,303
Otis.

718
00:36:53,372 --> 00:36:55,072
Hey, I wanted to catch you

719
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,506
before you headed out.

720
00:36:56,575 --> 00:36:57,941
Of course.

721
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,110
I...

722
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:02,779
I just wanted to say that, uh...

723
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:06,650
If you need me to keep
coming to the bullpen

724
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:09,019
just until I pass my medical clearance

725
00:37:09,088 --> 00:37:12,990
then I guess I could help you out.

726
00:37:13,058 --> 00:37:14,625
You sure?

727
00:37:14,693 --> 00:37:17,127
No, yeah... I mean...

728
00:37:17,196 --> 00:37:18,829
There are a few places that I could help

729
00:37:18,897 --> 00:37:20,264
Connie streamline some things.

730
00:37:20,332 --> 00:37:23,267
And Molly's North doesn't
open until 4:30, so...

731
00:37:23,335 --> 00:37:26,803
Yeah, sure. Happy to do it.

732
00:37:26,872 --> 00:37:28,305
Sounds great.

733
00:37:28,374 --> 00:37:30,607
Like I said, that's a real favor to me.

734
00:37:30,676 --> 00:37:32,376
Okay.

735
00:37:32,444 --> 00:37:35,312
Then, um, see you tomorrow.

736
00:37:35,381 --> 00:37:37,514
Sounds good. And, Otis...

737
00:37:39,518 --> 00:37:41,518
Thanks.

738
00:37:42,621 --> 00:37:45,322
No problem.

739
00:38:12,818 --> 00:38:14,651
All right.

740
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,620
I messed up.

741
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:21,725
I should have said something
the second he showed up at 51.

742
00:38:23,729 --> 00:38:25,395
I'm sorry.

743
00:38:26,498 --> 00:38:28,231
I'll tell you as many times as you want.

744
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,666
I'm sorry.

745
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,710
I wish this was the first time

746
00:38:39,778 --> 00:38:42,212
you've held something back from me.

747
00:38:43,749 --> 00:38:45,382
But it isn't.

748
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,221
There was the whole thing with Bria too.

749
00:38:56,362 --> 00:38:59,262
I love you. More than anything.

750
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:01,365
Every time you leave me out,

751
00:39:01,433 --> 00:39:04,568
you put a little
more distance between us.

752
00:39:11,877 --> 00:39:14,745
It won't happen again.

753
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:22,953
I don't want any distance between us.

754
00:39:29,895 --> 00:39:32,062
Okay.

755
00:39:32,131 --> 00:39:34,164
Okay?

756
00:39:34,233 --> 00:39:35,632
Yeah.

757
00:40:03,336 --> 00:40:08,336

1
00:00:00,473 --> 00:00:02,689
Listen, when you pulled the
plug on our relationship,

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,852
I had to assume that
I'd never see you again.

3
00:00:04,958 --> 00:00:07,889
I need you to imagine how tough
it's been, ever since I found out...

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,653
I'm carrying your baby.

5
00:00:10,262 --> 00:00:11,533
Talk to me.

6
00:00:11,653 --> 00:00:13,655
- I'm scared.
- Of what?

7
00:00:13,676 --> 00:00:14,758
The future.

8
00:00:14,758 --> 00:00:16,302
I am moving a little fast,

9
00:00:16,334 --> 00:00:18,540
that's why I wanna let
her know this is real.

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,808
I should be allowed to
retake the challenge test.

11
00:00:20,818 --> 00:00:23,255
And believe me, I will not fail.

12
00:00:23,287 --> 00:00:25,030
Jones' spot is not an option for you.

13
00:00:25,061 --> 00:00:28,885
- Doesn't 81 need a new candidate?
- You can't serve under Casey.

14
00:00:31,112 --> 00:00:33,866
Hey, what are you thinking about
going out two weeks from Saturday,

15
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,513
on one of those dinner-cruises?

16
00:00:35,591 --> 00:00:37,277
This is a disaster.

17
00:00:37,487 --> 00:00:38,517
What?

18
00:00:38,637 --> 00:00:40,408
My firefighter test is on Friday,

19
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:42,120
and I just found out that
Shay and I are scheduled

20
00:00:42,154 --> 00:00:43,822
for a payback shift the day before

21
00:00:43,856 --> 00:00:45,423
for the girls' weekend that we subbed out.

22
00:00:45,457 --> 00:00:47,258
I'm not gonna... I'm not
gonna make it to the test.

23
00:00:47,293 --> 00:00:49,494
Just talk to chief.

24
00:00:49,528 --> 00:00:51,329
Tell him you need to leave early that day.

25
00:00:51,363 --> 00:00:52,397
He'll make it work.

26
00:00:52,431 --> 00:00:54,666
- What if he can't?
- He will.

27
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,068
Deep breath, Gabby.

28
00:00:57,102 --> 00:00:59,771
You're gonna make it to the test.

29
00:00:59,805 --> 00:01:01,940
You're gonna kick the test's ass.

30
00:01:01,974 --> 00:01:04,909
[Exhales]

31
00:01:04,944 --> 00:01:07,979
If that actually happens...

32
00:01:08,013 --> 00:01:10,782
I'm leaving 51.

33
00:01:10,816 --> 00:01:12,617
Yeah.

34
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,321
I can't imagine that.

35
00:01:16,355 --> 00:01:18,823
Neither can I.

36
00:01:20,993 --> 00:01:22,660
But it's you and me,

37
00:01:22,695 --> 00:01:24,829
no matter what.

38
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:30,768
It's pretty ironic.

39
00:01:30,803 --> 00:01:32,770
Not being able to get pregnant
is part of what broke up

40
00:01:32,805 --> 00:01:34,639
my marriage years ago.

41
00:01:34,673 --> 00:01:37,475
Ah, but, you know, that was for the best.

42
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,544
It wasn't a good situation.

43
00:01:39,578 --> 00:01:40,678
Yeah. Sorry.

44
00:01:40,713 --> 00:01:42,380
I'm just rambling, but, uh, you know,

45
00:01:42,414 --> 00:01:45,250
I just accepted that motherhood
wasn't gonna happen for me.

46
00:01:45,284 --> 00:01:46,985
So this was a really big shock.

47
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:49,187
[Chuckles]

48
00:01:52,191 --> 00:01:56,494
The truth is, I can't stop
feeling like this is a gift.

49
00:01:56,529 --> 00:01:57,962
I understand that it is complicated

50
00:01:57,997 --> 00:02:00,865
and that we're coming at it from
two completely different places.

51
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,601
Not that different.

52
00:02:03,636 --> 00:02:06,437
I didn't expect to be a
father at this age either.

53
00:02:06,472 --> 00:02:08,540
It's a lot to think about.

54
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:10,742
And I want to give you time

55
00:02:10,776 --> 00:02:14,479
to consider how you want
to be involved or even if...

56
00:02:14,513 --> 00:02:16,114
Donna...

57
00:02:16,148 --> 00:02:19,050
I want to be a part of this child's life.

58
00:02:19,084 --> 00:02:22,654
I have no questions about that.

59
00:02:22,688 --> 00:02:24,656
Then you will be, of course.

60
00:02:31,597 --> 00:02:32,964
New union bylaws?

61
00:02:32,998 --> 00:02:35,400
No, this is a list of the
items that will be available

62
00:02:35,434 --> 00:02:37,802
at my yard sale this Saturday.

63
00:02:37,837 --> 00:02:39,370
Deals aplenty.

64

<i>What is a "makiyakinabe"?</i>

65
00:02:41,407 --> 00:02:44,776
A rectangular pan, used for
cooking Japanese omelets,

66
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,479
in good to egg-celent condition. [Laughs]

67
00:02:48,514 --> 00:02:50,915
Hey, everybody, this is Rick Newhouse.

68
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,251
He'll be joining us on
Squad to replace Clarke.

69
00:02:53,285 --> 00:02:54,986
- Good to meet you guys.
- Hi, Newhouse. Where you from?

70
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,088
Last job was Squad 6, south side.

71
00:02:57,123 --> 00:02:58,690
But I'm real happy to be here.

72
00:02:58,724 --> 00:03:00,425
Heard some great things about this crew.

73
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:02,427
Welcome.

74
00:03:02,461 --> 00:03:06,531
Do we tell him the "new
guy at 51" job is jinxed?

75
00:03:06,565 --> 00:03:10,235
Maybe he'll be the one to break the streak.

76
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,205
Test is in five days, huh?

77
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,840
Must have blocked it out.

78
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,743
One second I feel 100% ready,
and the next I'm panicking.

79
00:03:18,777 --> 00:03:21,312
Well, here's a possible solution...

80
00:03:21,347 --> 00:03:23,581
you could just not take it.

81
00:03:23,616 --> 00:03:25,683
Sorry. You know I support you.

82
00:03:25,718 --> 00:03:27,719
I just... what am I
going to do without you?

83
00:03:27,753 --> 00:03:30,522
It's one thing to go a few shifts,

84
00:03:30,556 --> 00:03:32,357
but you're my lead, my P.I.C.

85
00:03:32,391 --> 00:03:34,292
Look, you don't need me
around telling you what to do.

86
00:03:34,326 --> 00:03:35,560
And even if I do take the test,

87
00:03:35,594 --> 00:03:37,795
it's not like I'm gonna leave your life.

88
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:42,467
I know that, but with the
new job, the new hub...

89
00:03:42,501 --> 00:03:46,838
Bub, all the new hubbub around
you becoming a firefighter,

90
00:03:46,872 --> 00:03:48,740
you know, the excitement, you know?

91
00:03:48,774 --> 00:03:51,810
Meanwhile, I'll just still be here...

92
00:03:51,844 --> 00:03:53,244
same old same old.

93
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:55,580
Stop jinxing me, okay? I
haven't passed the test yet.

Big branch got caught in the chipper.

Ross tried to kick it loose,
but it snagged his pants

100
00:04:16,836 --> 00:04:18,203
and pulled him in. How far?

101
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:20,338

you guys showed up, but...

- Got it, Chief.

We need to remove the housing
to access the feed roller.

Okay, you take the lead on this.

Ross? Ross, I know that this hurts,

117
00:04:58,154 --> 00:04:59,822
but you're gonna have to try to stay still.

118
00:04:59,856 --> 00:05:02,558
Just tell me... am I gonna lose my legs?

119
00:05:02,592 --> 00:05:05,060
Ross, Ross, we're gonna get you out, okay?

120
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:07,529
We need you to take long, deep breaths.

121
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:14,369
- What do you think?
- One leg's bleeding out.

122
00:05:14,404 --> 00:05:15,704
I'm gonna place a
tourniquet, get a line in.

123
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:17,706
I need you to go to the
ambo, hang two bags of fluid

124
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:18,974
and put blood tubing on one of them.

125
00:05:19,008 --> 00:05:20,776
- Copy that.
- The feed wheel is hydraulic.

126
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,678
We're gonna need to
power this on to lift it.

127
00:05:22,712 --> 00:05:24,313
No, we can't risk starting the motor again.

128
00:05:24,347 --> 00:05:25,781
It could pull his leg farther in.

129
00:05:25,815 --> 00:05:27,549
If we take out the motor and
disconnect the bearing guides,

130
00:05:27,584 --> 00:05:29,952
we can move him manually. Let's do it.

You took the lead on this one. I'll drive.

It's the crew from Austin.

- Hey, Casey.

150
00:06:27,177 --> 00:06:29,845
Hey, I was sorry to hear
about your candidate,

151
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,213
Chief Jones's daughter, man.

152
00:06:31,247 --> 00:06:33,816
That's... it's a terrible thing.

153
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,985
Yeah. It was.

154
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:38,454
Speaking of candidates, I
heard your paramedic Dawson

155
00:06:38,488 --> 00:06:40,723
was near the top of her academy class.

156
00:06:40,757 --> 00:06:45,227
You know, she might be headed
our way if she passes the test.

157
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:48,497
Dawson's the best. You'd
be lucky to get her.

158
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:50,099
Oh, yeah, you think?

159
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:53,202
Even after what you went
through with Jones's daughter?

160
00:06:53,236 --> 00:06:54,837
- What does that mean?
- Oh, nothing, man.

161

Just tends to be a lot
of drama. That's all.

Dispatch: Traffic accident, North Damen...

Hey, Lieu, we're back
in. Accident on Damen.

164
00:07:02,846 --> 00:07:04,847
Hey, let's grab a beer soon, all right?

Yard sale, this Saturday...

171
00:07:25,301 --> 00:07:26,535
deals aplenty.

172
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:29,405
Cool. I'll take a look.

173
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,940
Whoa. Those all incident reports?

174
00:07:31,975 --> 00:07:33,709
Nah, it's for my other gig.

175
00:07:33,743 --> 00:07:35,010
What do you do?

176
00:07:35,045 --> 00:07:38,047
I work for my cousin doing skip tracing...

177
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:40,115
uh, finding people.

178

00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,953
Yeah? Jazzy, huh?

[Door opens]

00:07:46,856 --> 00:07:49,758
This is that tea I was telling you about.

183
00:07:49,793 --> 00:07:52,094
Has a nice kick of ginger.

184
00:07:52,128 --> 00:07:55,998
Ooh. Oh, yeah. Like it already.

185
00:07:56,032 --> 00:07:57,232
Thank you, Connie.

186
00:07:57,267 --> 00:07:59,201
My pleasure. [Chuckles]

187
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:07,076
You know Connie?

188
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,579
Yeah. Well, I met her this morning.

189
00:08:10,613 --> 00:08:12,214
What?

190
00:08:13,717 --> 00:08:16,919
I've never seen that
woman smile in my life.

191
00:08:23,693 --> 00:08:26,128
- Hey.
- Hey.

192
00:08:26,162 --> 00:08:27,763
Hey, uh, when are you gonna propose?

193
00:08:27,797 --> 00:08:29,131
Because I've almost let the cat

194
00:08:29,165 --> 00:08:30,532
out of the bag, like, once already.

195
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:32,468
- Shh.
- I'm terrible with secrets.

196
00:08:32,502 --> 00:08:34,236
Well, you might have mentioned that

197
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,205
before I made you my wingman.

198
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:38,107
- Wing... wingwoman, whatever.
- Whatever.

199
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:40,309
It's too late now. Come here.

200
00:08:41,544 --> 00:08:43,312
[Whispering] I was thinking about doing it

201
00:08:43,346 --> 00:08:44,780
two weeks from Saturday.

202
00:08:44,814 --> 00:08:48,350
I was thinking about one
of those river cruises.

203
00:08:48,385 --> 00:08:49,818
Could be the perfect setup.

204
00:08:49,853 --> 00:08:51,987
She's so distracted with
the firefighter test.

205
00:08:52,022 --> 00:08:54,289
- River cruise.
- Shh.

206
00:08:54,324 --> 00:08:59,194
[Normal voice] What is
wrong with a river cruise?

207
00:08:59,229 --> 00:09:00,562
Nothing... much. Just...

208
00:09:00,597 --> 00:09:02,831
anyhow, did you get a
chance to talk to her father?

209
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:05,467
No. Her parents are in
the Dominican Republic

210
00:09:05,502 --> 00:09:06,969
for the next few months.

211
00:09:07,003 --> 00:09:08,304
Her family is important to her.

212
00:09:08,338 --> 00:09:10,539
I can't ask for their
blessing on a phone call.

213
00:09:10,573 --> 00:09:11,840
[Scoffs] What are you gonna do?

214
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,308
Because you got to figure it out.

215
00:09:13,343 --> 00:09:16,211
Shay, remain calm, but
you're never gonna believe

216
00:09:16,246 --> 00:09:18,681
who's outside asking for you.

217
00:09:27,891 --> 00:09:29,058
Leslie.

218
00:09:29,092 --> 00:09:32,728
Stay right there. I'm calling the police.

219
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:43,315
You want me to talk to
Devon? I have plenty to say.

220
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,817
No, I got it.

221
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,728
I don't blame you for being furious,

222
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,696
- and if you call the cops...
- Look, you're gonna pay me

223
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,765
and my roommates back every dime you stole.

224
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,233
I can get you back some of the stuff,

225
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,868
and I'll pay what I can.

226
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,937
There's no excuse for what I did, Les.

227
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,873
You need to return what you stole, Devon.

228
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,778
Can we meet up later and talk?

229
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,914
When you have something to return.

230
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,081
Okay, that's fair.

231
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,616
So you're not gonna call the cops?

232
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:21,553
Look, if she goes to jail,
we'll never get anything back.

233
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,027
[Woman moaning] For the father,

234
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,663
bonding can begin right at birth.

Hey, Chief. This, uh...

237
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:36,902
[woman moaning] Ohh...

00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,672
Uh...

239
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,774
I...

240
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,677
- What do you want, Mills?
- Uh, just...

241
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:48,113
I wanted to hand over
Squad time sheets and...

242
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,049
uh, sorry to interrupt.

243
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,987
Uh, you want me to close the blinds?

244
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,155
It's not like that, Mills.

245
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:59,258
Okay. Sure. [Chuckles]

246
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,793
Hmph.

There you are.

250
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:12,938
Ah.

251
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:14,506
Hey.

252
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,447
Um...

253
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:24,149
Um...

254
00:11:24,229 --> 00:11:28,332
Is there any chance you
might want to lie still

255
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:30,601
and let me drag you
across the apparatus floor?

256
00:11:30,635 --> 00:11:33,737
I think you're, like,
just about dummy weight.

257
00:11:33,772 --> 00:11:35,673
No. I'd rather not.

258
00:11:35,707 --> 00:11:38,042
Wouldn't be good for
my tough-lieutenant rep.

259
00:11:38,076 --> 00:11:39,710
- [Chuckles] Is that your rep?
- Mm-hmm.

260
00:11:39,744 --> 00:11:41,178
I thought it was hot lieutenant.

261
00:11:41,212 --> 00:11:44,648
- Hey, I'm not playing dummy.
- Darn it.

262
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:47,952
Listen, um, I ran into
Tommy Welch from Austin

263
00:11:47,986 --> 00:11:50,154
after you guys left the wood chipper run.

264
00:11:50,188 --> 00:11:52,556
- Uh, who's that?
- Truck lieutenant.

265
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,725
I guess Austin is looking for a candidate.

266
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,994
Oh, yeah? What's Welch like?

267
00:11:57,028 --> 00:11:59,830
- He's a little tough.
- [Chuckles]

268
00:11:59,864 --> 00:12:02,266
Babe, I can handle tough.

269
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,968
Of course you can. The thing is...

270
00:12:04,002 --> 00:12:06,704
Austin got their first
female firefighter last year,

271
00:12:06,738 --> 00:12:08,939
and she barely lasted two weeks.

272
00:12:08,974 --> 00:12:11,675
Filed some grievance against
the guys in the house.

273
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:16,213
Well, we both know that there
can be two sides to that story.

274
00:12:16,248 --> 00:12:18,916
- True enough.
- [Alarm blaring]

Avenue Bridge and Riverwalk.

00:12:24,789 --> 00:12:26,590
I hear diving's your specialty.

278
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,359
Check it out and let me know.

I'm gonna need additional

ambo units dispatched to Riverwalk Pier.

281
00:12:32,864 --> 00:12:33,964
- Yeah.
- I was guiding her in.

282
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:35,299
All of a sudden,

283
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,968
the captain just accelerated,
took out the dock.

284
00:12:38,003 --> 00:12:40,104
- Hey! You all right?
- Hurry!

285
00:12:40,138 --> 00:12:42,273
We don't know how much
longer we can hold him.

286
00:12:42,307 --> 00:12:43,774
Are there any more in the water?

287
00:12:43,808 --> 00:12:45,476
Just Dennis, but his leg is stuck.

288
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,111
We can't pull him up.

289
00:12:47,145 --> 00:12:48,879
- Otis, charge a four
- Inch line.

290
00:12:48,913 --> 00:12:51,215
Cruz, let's get the
aerial across to the boat.

291
00:12:51,249 --> 00:12:53,450
Herrmann and Mouch, get
aboard and help the victims.

292
00:12:53,485 --> 00:12:55,419
Guys, it's 25 feet deep
here. Let's get a ladder,

293
00:12:55,453 --> 00:12:56,754
secure it to the wall,

294
00:12:56,788 --> 00:12:58,689
and have tools ready to
bring down to us, all right?

295
00:12:58,723 --> 00:12:59,924
Let's go.

296

[Background announcement,
overlapping chatter]

297
00:13:25,817 --> 00:13:28,285
His leg must be caught on something

298
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,887
we tried to pull him up, but we can't.

299
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:31,222
We got him now.

300
00:13:31,256 --> 00:13:33,724
Okay, guys, we're gonna bring you in, okay?

301
00:13:33,758 --> 00:13:36,560
[Woman whimpering]

302
00:13:38,163 --> 00:13:40,598
Paramedic's on their way.

303
00:13:40,632 --> 00:13:42,099
Broken leg!

304
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:43,567
You see the captain around?

305
00:13:43,602 --> 00:13:45,236
Maybe he abandoned ship.

306
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,672
Captain's always the last one off.

307
00:13:50,609 --> 00:13:54,011
Hey, 'I'm gonna go down and have a look.

308
00:13:58,883 --> 00:14:01,251
I don't see anybody.

309
00:14:01,286 --> 00:14:03,120
There.

310
00:14:06,324 --> 00:14:08,893
Fire department. Open up!

311
00:14:08,927 --> 00:14:11,228
Hey! Fire department! Can you hear us?

312
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:18,002
Whoa!

313
00:14:18,036 --> 00:14:20,671
Taking a little midday
booze cruise, are you?

314
00:14:20,705 --> 00:14:22,673
Let's go, pal.

315
00:14:26,211 --> 00:14:28,846
I see the problem!

316
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,682
His leg is wedged between
the bracing and the piling.

317
00:14:31,716 --> 00:14:35,052
We're gonna need an extra
set of hands and a halligan.

318
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:39,890
Mills!

319
00:14:42,961 --> 00:14:45,580
We need you to hang on to Dennis
when we go back under, all right?

320
00:14:45,582 --> 00:14:48,232
Yeah, copy that.

321
00:14:51,303 --> 00:14:53,203
He's showing signs of hypothermia.

322
00:14:53,238 --> 00:14:54,505
You got five minutes.

323
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:56,941
Got it.

324
00:15:09,084 --> 00:15:10,951
- All right!
- Pull him up.

325
00:15:10,986 --> 00:15:12,453
Give me your hand, Tony.

326
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:14,555
Pull him up!

327
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,390
We're good.

328
00:15:20,695 --> 00:15:22,429
[Rescue radio chatter, background noise]

329
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:25,566
Methinks the jolly captain
here needs a breathalyzer test.

330
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,834
The hell I do.

331
00:15:26,868 --> 00:15:28,202
- Casey.
- Yeah.

332
00:15:28,236 --> 00:15:30,571
How fast can you tie a handcuff knot?

333
00:15:30,605 --> 00:15:32,339
About 2 1/2 seconds, Chief.

334
00:15:32,374 --> 00:15:34,608
Do it.

335
00:15:39,948 --> 00:15:42,016
Hey, you guys ever find that captain?

336
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:44,051
Do the honors.

337
00:15:44,085 --> 00:15:45,786
He's all yours.

338
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,489
Get up.

339
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:52,459
See ya.

340
00:16:00,035 --> 00:16:01,652
- Hey.
- Hey.

341
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:03,624
Nice job getting that guy out of the water.

342
00:16:03,658 --> 00:16:05,126
You and Newhouse worked well together.

343
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,560
Yeah.

344
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,031
What are you gonna do about Devon?

345
00:16:11,066 --> 00:16:12,700
[Sighs]

346
00:16:12,734 --> 00:16:15,369
I told you. I'm gonna get our stuff back.

347
00:16:20,409 --> 00:16:22,877
Trust me, I'm not carrying a
torch for this girl, all right?

348
00:16:22,911 --> 00:16:24,378
If she doesn't get our stuff back soon,

349
00:16:24,412 --> 00:16:25,846
I'm gonna call the cops.

350
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:28,616
Just don't let her use this
to get close to you again.

351
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,684
I won't.

352
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:36,957
I got to go. I told Dawson I'd
run a quick errand with her.

353
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,001
Hey, thanks for doing this.

354
00:16:47,035 --> 00:16:50,704
Yeah, you know I love a good detour.

355
00:16:50,739 --> 00:16:52,506
Hey, guys. Hi.

356
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,609
Hey, we're from 51. I'm Dawson, Shay.

357
00:16:55,644 --> 00:16:58,546
- How's it going?
- [Clears throat]

358
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,781
You ladies need something?

359
00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:03,651
Um, well, we were just on
our way back from an errand,

360
00:17:03,685 --> 00:17:05,886
and I wanted to introduce
myself because I'm about to

361
00:17:05,921 --> 00:17:07,722
take the firefighter test.

362
00:17:07,756 --> 00:17:10,624
And, uh, I guess Lieutenant Welch

363
00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:13,360
heard I might land at the house if I pass,

364
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:16,397
which would be cool.

365
00:17:16,431 --> 00:17:20,234
Deal me out of this hand.
I'll go get the lieutenant.

366
00:17:20,268 --> 00:17:22,703
Okay, I mean, only if he's not busy...

367
00:17:34,182 --> 00:17:37,118
So which one of you is Dawson?

368
00:17:37,152 --> 00:17:41,155
That'd be me. Nice to meet you, Lieutenant.

369
00:17:41,189 --> 00:17:43,958
Friendly place you got here, Lieutenant.

370
00:17:43,992 --> 00:17:45,993
You know, as you probably heard,

371
00:17:46,027 --> 00:17:48,162
our past experience
with a female firefighter

372
00:17:48,196 --> 00:17:50,498
wasn't real positive.

373
00:17:50,532 --> 00:17:52,666
So I'm sure you can understand
if we're not thrilled

374
00:17:52,701 --> 00:17:55,002
about the chief forcing
another one down our throat.

375
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:00,608
Didn't realize it was against your will.

376
00:18:03,378 --> 00:18:06,046
Oops.

377
00:18:06,081 --> 00:18:07,782
Thanks for the warm welcome, guys.

378
00:18:07,816 --> 00:18:11,118
But, uh, it's time for us
to go start our periods.

379
00:18:20,729 --> 00:18:22,863
If I'm lucky enough to pass the test

380
00:18:22,898 --> 00:18:25,032
and I do wind up here at Austin,

381
00:18:25,066 --> 00:18:27,168
I hope I'll change your mind.

382
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,275
Anybody got any big plans over the next 48?

383
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:36,577
Nah, Cindy just called and
said Lee Henry came home

384
00:18:36,611 --> 00:18:39,647
with head lice, so there's that.

385
00:18:39,681 --> 00:18:43,417
You guys hear Newhouse is a
skip tracer in his off hours?

386
00:18:43,452 --> 00:18:45,720
Sounds kind of like a private investigator.

387
00:18:45,754 --> 00:18:47,755
- He does some real jazzy stuff.
- Yeah?

388
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:50,825
Why is everybody falling all
over themselves with this guy?

389
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:54,095
Whatever happened to proving yourself?

390
00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:56,430
[Chuckles] You're jealous.

391
00:18:56,465 --> 00:18:59,166
[Laughs] It's new-kid-in-town syndrome.

392
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:02,069
Even Connie's walking
around mooning over this guy,

393
00:19:02,104 --> 00:19:03,804
and you, sir, are jealous.

394
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:06,007
Get out of here.

395
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,475
Now you're going on a date with her?

396
00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:10,044
Give me a break. She's not good for you.

397
00:19:10,078 --> 00:19:11,445
Why can't you see that?

398
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,247
[Sighs]

399
00:19:13,281 --> 00:19:14,982
You have to know Devon's playing you.

400
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:16,917
She said she has some
of our stuff to return.

401
00:19:16,952 --> 00:19:18,853
I told her I'd meet her
for a drink at Molly's.

402
00:19:18,887 --> 00:19:20,221
You know? What's wrong with that?

403
00:19:20,255 --> 00:19:22,790
You're meeting up with Devon?

404
00:19:22,824 --> 00:19:24,825
- Devon, the hoodlum, Devon?
- Yes.

405
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,193
She showed up.

406
00:19:26,228 --> 00:19:28,529
She says she wants to make things right.

407
00:19:28,563 --> 00:19:29,563
I'm just trying...

408
00:19:29,598 --> 00:19:31,365
Does she still have my Viper helmet?

409
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,135
Because that is the only way
things will ever be right again.

410
00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:36,637
Look, I am doing my best.

411
00:19:36,671 --> 00:19:40,307
I am trying to get back what
she stole from all of us, okay?

412
00:19:40,342 --> 00:19:42,743
So can you just give me a little credit

413
00:19:42,778 --> 00:19:45,579
that I'm not a complete dupe?

414
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,750
[Sighs]

415
00:19:49,785 --> 00:19:52,386
How did that just get turned around on us?

416
00:19:52,421 --> 00:19:55,623
[Sighs] Check your phone again.

417
00:19:55,657 --> 00:19:58,626
I did two seconds ago. No message.

418
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,329
I gave a hoodlum a second shot.
I'm an idiot, and I know it.

419
00:20:02,364 --> 00:20:04,298
Feel free to tell me anyhow, though.

420
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,500
Hey, not gonna happen, lady.

421
00:20:06,535 --> 00:20:08,669
My favorite part about you
is that under your crusty,

422
00:20:08,703 --> 00:20:11,372
bitter exterior lies an eternal optimist.

423
00:20:11,406 --> 00:20:13,741
You give all us fools second
chances when we screw up,

424
00:20:13,775 --> 00:20:16,710
and that is why we love you.

425
00:20:16,745 --> 00:20:18,713
Seriously, what am I gonna do without you?

426
00:20:18,747 --> 00:20:21,415
[Laughs] You'll be fine. I promise.

427
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,984
You cannot work at Austin.

428
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:25,820
[Sighs] What if I don't have a choice?

429
00:20:25,854 --> 00:20:28,789
No, there's got to be another place.

430
00:20:28,824 --> 00:20:32,526
Hey, we've been working with
guys since we started in C.F.D.

431
00:20:32,561 --> 00:20:34,361
Yeah, we had to prove ourselves every day

432
00:20:34,396 --> 00:20:36,530
and let plenty of stuff roll off our backs,

433
00:20:36,565 --> 00:20:38,032
but I can handle that.

434
00:20:38,066 --> 00:20:40,201
This place is different.
I know you felt it too.

435
00:20:40,235 --> 00:20:41,802
It's stone age.

436
00:20:41,837 --> 00:20:42,970
Shay.

437
00:20:45,273 --> 00:20:48,376
You just say the word,
and I will kick her ass.

438
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,012
Looks like somebody else already did.

439
00:20:51,046 --> 00:20:54,181
My truck broke down for the umpteenth time,

440
00:20:54,216 --> 00:20:57,418
and they towed it off
with my cell phone inside.

441
00:21:04,593 --> 00:21:06,160
You brought it back.

442
00:21:06,194 --> 00:21:08,095
The guys I gave it to couldn't sell it.

443
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:12,199
Turns out it's a knockoff,
only worth a few bucks.

444
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:20,675
It's not much, but it's a start.

445
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:26,614
I'm not trying to make excuses,

446
00:21:26,648 --> 00:21:29,417
but I want you to know
why I did what I did.

447
00:21:29,451 --> 00:21:31,952
[Sighs]

448
00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:36,691
I got a call my dad was
in jail in San Antonio,

449
00:21:36,725 --> 00:21:38,292
and I panicked.

450
00:21:38,327 --> 00:21:41,028
I mean, maybe the guy drinks
too much, but he's a decent man.

451
00:21:41,063 --> 00:21:43,431
And he saved my ass more
times than I can count

452
00:21:43,465 --> 00:21:44,865
when I was a kid.

453
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,901
I knew I needed to get him out,

454
00:21:46,935 --> 00:21:50,438
so I did the stupidest
thing I have ever done.

455
00:21:50,472 --> 00:21:53,240
So I took that stuff from
you and your roommates

456
00:21:53,275 --> 00:21:56,010
and put together bail.

457
00:21:59,748 --> 00:22:01,349
You're my witness.

458
00:22:01,383 --> 00:22:03,217
I'm swearing right here right now,

459
00:22:03,251 --> 00:22:05,553
I will get every bit of the money I owe

460
00:22:05,587 --> 00:22:07,188
back to Leslie and her roommates.

461
00:22:07,222 --> 00:22:10,057
If I'm your witness, you better make good.

462
00:22:10,092 --> 00:22:12,893
I will.

463
00:22:12,928 --> 00:22:14,562
I promise.

464
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,935
That was so much fun.

465
00:22:22,437 --> 00:22:23,537
Hey, Wallace.

466
00:22:23,572 --> 00:22:25,339
- Hey.
- Hey.

467
00:22:25,374 --> 00:22:26,707
Is everything okay?

468
00:22:26,742 --> 00:22:28,309
I was just wondering if
you had a minute to talk,

469
00:22:28,343 --> 00:22:31,379
but I can... I can see
that you're busy, so...

470
00:22:31,413 --> 00:22:32,847
- No.
- It can wait.

471
00:22:32,881 --> 00:22:34,348
Really.

472
00:22:34,383 --> 00:22:36,617
Hey, you guys. I'll meet
you at Terry's, okay?

473
00:22:36,651 --> 00:22:39,086
- See you there.
- [Chuckles]

474
00:22:42,224 --> 00:22:44,925
So what's on your mind?

475
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,162
I just wanted to say...

476
00:22:48,196 --> 00:22:51,832
Of course, I've been thinking a lot...

477
00:22:51,867 --> 00:22:56,504
about all this. And, uh...

478
00:22:56,538 --> 00:22:59,140
[Sighs] [Laughs] Yeah.

479
00:22:59,174 --> 00:23:00,875
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

480
00:23:03,812 --> 00:23:07,148
I believe the best thing for the...

481
00:23:07,182 --> 00:23:09,317
I believe the best thing
for this baby would be

482
00:23:09,351 --> 00:23:12,253
if you and I got married.

483
00:23:12,287 --> 00:23:15,623
If you and I were husband
and wife, I could support you

484
00:23:15,657 --> 00:23:17,391
and the child, both of you,

485
00:23:17,426 --> 00:23:21,729
financially without any additional...

486
00:23:21,763 --> 00:23:25,066
documentation.

487
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,535
I also believe that it would be
a much more stable environment

488
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:29,603
for the child, so...

489
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:36,010
Uh...

490
00:23:36,044 --> 00:23:39,046
Was... that a proposal?

491
00:23:40,449 --> 00:23:43,217
Yes. Yes, it is.

492
00:23:45,253 --> 00:23:49,190
Then, uh, my answer is no.

493
00:23:49,224 --> 00:23:52,059
No way.

494
00:23:53,962 --> 00:23:56,964
[Footsteps departing]

495
00:24:15,478 --> 00:24:17,612
Hey, morning, Chief.

496
00:24:17,646 --> 00:24:18,880
Hey, what's up?

497
00:24:18,914 --> 00:24:20,248
Uh, I don't want to bug you,

498
00:24:20,282 --> 00:24:22,183
but you said you'd check
on bringing relief in early

499
00:24:22,218 --> 00:24:24,319
tomorrow since the
firefighter's test is tomorrow.

500
00:24:24,353 --> 00:24:26,421
Uh, sorry, I meant to let you know.

501
00:24:26,455 --> 00:24:28,423
Connie's already lined
it up. You're good to go.

502
00:24:28,457 --> 00:24:31,259
Oh, great. Thanks.

503
00:24:31,293 --> 00:24:35,130
Hey, any chance you know
Laura Chiapetta over at 77?

504
00:24:35,164 --> 00:24:36,831
Because I heard that she was on Truck there

505
00:24:36,866 --> 00:24:39,000
and dated the lieutenant,
kind of under the radar.

506
00:24:39,035 --> 00:24:42,370
- And so I was thinking maybe...
- Yes, I know Laura.

507
00:24:42,405 --> 00:24:44,873
She and Lieutenant Kent
started fighting during calls.

508
00:24:44,907 --> 00:24:49,644
Relationship went south. He
got kicked to another house.

509
00:24:49,678 --> 00:24:53,648
You want to know who took
the heat for all of it?

510
00:24:53,682 --> 00:24:56,818
The chief who let it happen.

511
00:24:56,852 --> 00:24:58,653
You become a firefighter, Dawson,

512
00:24:58,688 --> 00:25:02,490
you cannot stay at 51.

513
00:25:02,525 --> 00:25:04,592
I thought it was worth one more shot.

514
00:25:04,627 --> 00:25:06,161
Hmm.

515
00:25:06,195 --> 00:25:08,596
I wish Laura had told
me the end of that story.

516
00:25:08,631 --> 00:25:10,999
Mm-hmm. Dawson...

517
00:25:11,033 --> 00:25:13,768
[Sighs] Are you ready for your test?

518
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:16,671
Yes, sir. I believe I am.

519
00:25:16,706 --> 00:25:18,640
Good.

520
00:25:20,209 --> 00:25:22,177
That boat accident just
kind of turned me off

521
00:25:22,211 --> 00:25:24,245
to the whole proposal-on-a-cruise idea.

522
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,513
- Really?
- Yeah.

523
00:25:25,548 --> 00:25:27,082
Didn't realize you were the one proposing.

524
00:25:27,116 --> 00:25:28,783
Hey, smokey.

525
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,952
It's just that I have to
hear about it all the time,

526
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,287
so I got skin in the game.

527
00:25:32,321 --> 00:25:35,123
What about a hot-air
balloon ride over the lake?

528
00:25:35,157 --> 00:25:37,492
I don't know.

529
00:25:37,526 --> 00:25:39,461
- All right, never mind on the hot
- Air balloon idea.

530
00:25:39,495 --> 00:25:41,062
I got a lot more where that came from.

531
00:25:41,097 --> 00:25:42,731
[Phone chimes]

532
00:25:42,765 --> 00:25:45,500
Hey, did you figure out
what to do with Dawson's dad?

533
00:25:45,534 --> 00:25:47,302
Yeah.

534
00:25:47,336 --> 00:25:49,671
I did.

535
00:25:49,705 --> 00:25:52,874
Hey, thanks for coming by, Antonio.

536
00:25:52,908 --> 00:25:54,642
You didn't have to rush over here.

537
00:25:54,677 --> 00:25:55,977
Yeah, I did.

538
00:25:56,011 --> 00:25:57,412
When you said this was on the sly,

539
00:25:57,446 --> 00:25:59,614
I figured out right away what you're up to.

540
00:25:59,648 --> 00:26:01,116
- You did?
- Sure.

541
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,617
We're talking surprise party, right,

542
00:26:02,651 --> 00:26:04,652
if Gabby passes the test?

543
00:26:04,687 --> 00:26:07,555
Uh, that's a great idea,

544
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:10,925
but, uh, no, actually.

545
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,662
Um... [exhales sharply]

546
00:26:13,696 --> 00:26:15,830
I know your parents are out of town,

547
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,565
so I'm coming to you,

548
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,501
because I think your sister

549
00:26:19,535 --> 00:26:21,803
is the most amazing woman I've ever met,

550
00:26:21,837 --> 00:26:25,173
and I... I'd like to ask
for her hand in marriage,

551
00:26:25,207 --> 00:26:29,978
but, uh, I wanted to
get your blessing first.

552
00:26:31,314 --> 00:26:32,914
[Exhales sharply]

553
00:26:32,948 --> 00:26:35,784
Seriously, bro?

554
00:26:35,818 --> 00:26:37,352
You couldn't do this the right way

555
00:26:37,386 --> 00:26:39,120
and wait for my father to get back?

556
00:26:39,155 --> 00:26:42,323
Because I can tell you now,
in my culture, if someone...

557
00:26:45,528 --> 00:26:48,630
I'm messing with you, man.
Of course you got my blessing.

558
00:26:48,664 --> 00:26:51,099
Damn, Antonio! [Laughs]

559
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:54,302
Hey, you know me... I hit
them when they're on the ropes.

560
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,804
I'm gonna get you back.

561
00:26:55,838 --> 00:26:57,505
No holds barred when we're family.

562
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,308
- That's how the Dawsons play.
- Yeah, I've noticed.

563
00:27:00,343 --> 00:27:02,944
Look at this. I'm thrilled
for the both of you, man.

00:27:02,979 --> 00:27:04,913
[Both laughing]

565
00:27:05,007 --> 00:27:06,708
So he kissed his wife good-bye,

566
00:27:06,742 --> 00:27:08,543
heads off to work, and vanished, right?

567
00:27:08,577 --> 00:27:09,911
Police have no leads.

568
00:27:09,945 --> 00:27:12,313
But his wife tells us
that he likes old cars,

569
00:27:12,348 --> 00:27:13,748
specifically Mustangs.

570
00:27:13,783 --> 00:27:15,917
So me and my cousin... we start
looking through classifieds

571
00:27:15,951 --> 00:27:17,052
in neighboring states.

572
00:27:17,086 --> 00:27:19,087
Sure enough, that's how we found him,

573
00:27:19,121 --> 00:27:20,855
buying a stripped-down, candy-apple red

574
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,291
1967 Shelby in Iowa City.

[Laughs]

576
00:27:25,461 --> 00:27:26,995
Yeah, the guy moved there,
changed his last name,

577
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:28,363
and even married another woman.

578
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:29,697
- You're kidding.
- No.

579
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:32,167
Oh, great move, though,
getting him with the car.

580
00:27:32,201 --> 00:27:35,270
Seems pretty common sense to me.

581

[Chuckles]

582
00:27:42,878 --> 00:27:44,879
You, uh, need help finding something?

583
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:48,016
Oh, no, man, just scoping
out the snack situation here.

584
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,651
Well, let me know if you have any questions

585
00:27:49,685 --> 00:27:50,652
about anything here at 51.

586
00:27:50,686 --> 00:27:52,387
I'm happy to help.

587
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:55,356
Cool. Will do.

588
00:27:55,391 --> 00:27:57,058
Where you from, Mills?

589
00:27:57,093 --> 00:28:01,029
Mount Greenwood. My dad
was on Squad out there.

590
00:28:01,063 --> 00:28:02,330
Nice neighborhood.

591
00:28:02,365 --> 00:28:05,100
Yeah, my mom is from Humboldt Park,

592
00:28:05,134 --> 00:28:06,501
so I spent a lot of time there too.

593
00:28:06,535 --> 00:28:08,336
- Right.
- How about you?

594
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,804
I grew up in Roseland.

595
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:11,539
Wow. That is a tough part of town.

596
00:28:11,574 --> 00:28:13,942
- You go back there often?
- All the time.

597
00:28:13,976 --> 00:28:16,878
I mean, people hear that name,
they react like it's a war zone.

598
00:28:16,912 --> 00:28:21,282
But it's a neighborhood...
filled with good people.

599
00:28:21,317 --> 00:28:23,651
Your second job...

600
00:28:23,686 --> 00:28:26,454
how much do you need to know
about someone to find them?

601
00:28:26,489 --> 00:28:27,989
Why? You got a case for us?

602
00:28:28,023 --> 00:28:29,657
No, no, just, uh...

603
00:28:29,692 --> 00:28:31,593
it sounds like interesting work.

604
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,128
All right.

605
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,667
Got something for you.

606
00:28:41,871 --> 00:28:44,506
Oh, my gods.

607
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,808
Ah, your Viper helmet.

608
00:28:46,842 --> 00:28:48,243
How did she get it back?

609
00:28:48,277 --> 00:28:51,546
I can't believe any
collector would just buy this

610
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:55,183
- and then let it go.
- Hmm. She found a way.

611
00:28:55,217 --> 00:28:57,385
Thank you.

612
00:29:00,256 --> 00:29:02,824
Hey. 500 bucks from Devon.

613
00:29:02,858 --> 00:29:06,194
It's just a down payment on what she owes.

614
00:29:06,228 --> 00:29:07,595
Did she put this money together,

615
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:10,865
or did you take it out of
your savings to cover for her?

616
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,734
She was helping out her dad, okay?

617
00:29:12,768 --> 00:29:14,369
She feels really bad.

618
00:29:14,403 --> 00:29:16,037
She's gonna get us back all the money.

619
00:29:16,072 --> 00:29:17,372
You think this is about the money?

620
00:29:17,406 --> 00:29:19,040
It's not about that.

621
00:29:19,075 --> 00:29:22,410
It's about her being a
liar and stepping on you...

622
00:29:24,447 --> 00:29:26,748
again.

623
00:29:30,453 --> 00:29:33,455
T-minus 12 hours till the big test, huh?

624
00:29:33,489 --> 00:29:36,291
[Chuckles] 11 1/2, but who's counting?

625
00:29:36,325 --> 00:29:38,226
I felt fine until, like, an hour ago.

626
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,095
You're gonna be great.

627
00:29:40,129 --> 00:29:41,696
Hey, thanks for being so supportive

628
00:29:41,731 --> 00:29:43,198
through this whole thing.

629
00:29:43,232 --> 00:29:46,768
Hey, Mills, fancy joining
me out back for a cigar?

630
00:29:46,802 --> 00:29:48,436
Sure.

631
00:29:51,941 --> 00:29:54,642
- Congratulations, Chief.
- Ah.

632
00:29:54,677 --> 00:29:57,879
- Becoming a dad.
- [Chuckles]

633
00:29:57,913 --> 00:30:01,349
I don't understand her
reaction to my proposal.

634
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:04,419
I mean, I may have sent the
relationship way off track,

635
00:30:04,453 --> 00:30:06,755
but...

636
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:08,957
I care for this woman.

637
00:30:08,991 --> 00:30:10,859
Did you tell her that?

638
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:12,427
Of course.

639
00:30:12,461 --> 00:30:15,296
In so many words, I...

640
00:30:15,331 --> 00:30:17,565
that's why I don't do relationships.

641
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,000
- [Laughs]
- I mean I tell her

642
00:30:19,034 --> 00:30:20,769
I want to provide support, stability

643
00:30:20,803 --> 00:30:22,837
for the child under the law.

644
00:30:22,872 --> 00:30:24,539
She...

645
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,908
she gets mad?

646
00:30:26,942 --> 00:30:30,078
Don't make no damn sense.

647
00:30:30,112 --> 00:30:32,547
What?

648
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:35,850
- Can I be honest?
- Yeah.

649
00:30:35,885 --> 00:30:39,554
The way that you just said it right now

650
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:43,858
made it sound like a whole bunch
of legal talk about the kid.

651
00:30:45,394 --> 00:30:47,595
If you really care about this
woman the way that you say,

652
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,864
then you're gonna have
to put yourself out there.

653
00:30:49,899 --> 00:30:51,566
- What does that mean?
- That means dropping

654
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,502
all this formal stuff and
telling her like it is.

655
00:30:54,537 --> 00:30:57,906
What if she pushes me away...

656
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,240
and...

657
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:02,911
make myself look like an ass?

658
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:04,946
That can definitely happen.

659
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,417
Yeah.

660
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:17,392
Hey, need a hand?

661
00:31:17,426 --> 00:31:20,128
No, this isn't actually work related.

662
00:31:20,162 --> 00:31:24,132
It's a lawn ornament I'm hoping
to unload at the yard sale.

663
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:28,770
<i>Any interest in a tachi-gata
style stone lantern?</i>

664
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:30,438
Has a built in rain gauge.

665
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:32,707
I got kid junk all over my lawn.

666
00:31:32,742 --> 00:31:35,076
I got no room.

667
00:31:36,545 --> 00:31:40,949
You know how I signed up for
a bunch of singles websites,

668
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:42,384
went on all those dates?

669
00:31:42,418 --> 00:31:44,919
Oh, yeah. How's that going?

670
00:31:44,954 --> 00:31:46,121
Not good.

671
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:47,389
Nothing worked out,

672
00:31:47,423 --> 00:31:49,390
and the whole thing just
got me more depressed.

673
00:31:49,425 --> 00:31:51,893
Then I had this epiphany.

674
00:31:51,927 --> 00:31:54,562
I never really let go of mari.

675
00:31:54,597 --> 00:31:57,065
I'm holding on to all these things

676
00:31:57,099 --> 00:32:00,735
that remind me of her, and
no wonder I can't move on.

677
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:02,270
Look, Herrmann,

678
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:05,307
I know the last few new additions to 51

679
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:07,576
have led to some pretty rough seas,

680
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:10,812
but Newhouse seems like a good guy.

681
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,280
Maybe...

682
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:16,851
I should have a yard sale.

683
00:32:16,886 --> 00:32:19,421
Yeah.

684
00:32:19,455 --> 00:32:21,056
That's what I was thinking.

685
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:23,391
- Yeah.
- [Alarm blaring]

686
00:32:23,426 --> 00:32:25,360
[On P.A.] Ambulance
61... woman in distress,

687
00:32:25,394 --> 00:32:27,228
1916 Pearl Street.

688
00:32:27,263 --> 00:32:30,265
[Siren wailing]

689
00:32:34,537 --> 00:32:36,237
Ugh!

690
00:32:36,272 --> 00:32:38,740
Hey, dispatch, we have an apartment number?

691
00:32:38,774 --> 00:32:41,443
Negative, 61.

692
00:32:41,477 --> 00:32:42,877
Up here, please!

693
00:32:42,912 --> 00:32:44,179
Where are you, ma'am?

694
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:47,315
Fifth floor!

695
00:32:50,653 --> 00:32:52,887
[Breathing heavily]

696
00:32:58,661 --> 00:33:00,662
My name's Gabriela. This is Leslie.

697
00:33:00,696 --> 00:33:03,164
- What's your name, ma'am?
- Grace. Grace Seitzman.

698
00:33:03,199 --> 00:33:04,666
What's going on, Grace?

699
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,935
It started to hurt really
bad near my stomach,

700
00:33:06,969 --> 00:33:08,303
but it can't be contractions yet.

701
00:33:08,337 --> 00:33:09,904
Okay, how pregnant are you, Grace?

702
00:33:09,939 --> 00:33:12,540
I'm only eight months. It's
too soon for the baby to come.

703
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:15,410
- Is this your first pregnancy?
- Yes. Oh!

704
00:33:15,444 --> 00:33:17,912
Okay, breathe through this for me, Grace.

705
00:33:17,947 --> 00:33:19,948
Can we get her down
the stairs in the chair?

706
00:33:19,982 --> 00:33:22,250
No, the stairs are too steep.

707
00:33:22,284 --> 00:33:23,351
Do you think you can walk?

708
00:33:23,386 --> 00:33:25,787
No, I don't think I can.

709
00:33:25,821 --> 00:33:28,189
Grace, you're gonna have to try.

710
00:33:28,224 --> 00:33:31,659
[Breathing heavily]

711
00:33:31,694 --> 00:33:35,330
- Okay.
- Come on. All right.

712
00:33:35,364 --> 00:33:39,301
[Grace whimpering]

713
00:33:39,335 --> 00:33:42,637
Oh, my God! Oh, why does it hurt like this?

714
00:33:42,671 --> 00:33:44,039
Hang in there, Grace.

715
00:33:44,073 --> 00:33:45,707
Strong contractions don't
mean anything's wrong.

716
00:33:45,741 --> 00:33:48,410
They just hurt like hell. Here we go.

717
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:51,646
But it's too soon for the baby to come.

718
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,882
Oh, oh...

719
00:33:53,916 --> 00:33:55,316
Her contractions are coming pretty quick.

720
00:33:55,351 --> 00:33:56,685
Yeah, we're gonna need to take a look

721
00:33:56,719 --> 00:33:58,520
to see if the baby's
getting close, okay, Grace?

722
00:33:58,554 --> 00:34:00,255
- Oh! Oh!
- Grace, we're gonna need you

723
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:01,556
to sit down and relax for us, all right?

724
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:04,893
Oh! The baby is not coming!

725
00:34:04,927 --> 00:34:07,576
The baby is coming, Grace.

726
00:34:10,475 --> 00:34:12,685
Get me a blanket, clamp, and suction ball.

727
00:34:12,685 --> 00:34:13,643
On it.

728
00:34:18,424 --> 00:34:21,113
Mouch, Cindy's birthday is coming up.

729
00:34:21,155 --> 00:34:23,751
Anything at that yard sale,
you know, that she might go for?

730
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,298
Uh, I got a nice ***,

731
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:28,264
and a practically new bottle of tsubaki tsubaki.

732
00:34:28,306 --> 00:34:30,634
That stuff is pretty hard to come by.

733
00:34:30,954 --> 00:34:32,105
What is it?

734
00:34:32,138 --> 00:34:35,533
I believe it's a hair oil of some kind.

735
00:34:35,653 --> 00:34:38,827
So you're gonna buy your wife a
birthday gift at Mouch's yard sale.

736
00:34:39,525 --> 00:34:41,298
Any chance it kills lice?

737
00:34:41,978 --> 00:34:43,879
What's up, Newhouse?

738
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:50,686
Hey, uh, Newhouse. You might not know this,

739
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,488
but, uh, me and some of the guys here...

740
00:34:52,522 --> 00:34:54,890
we, uh... we own the best bar in Chicago.

741
00:34:54,925 --> 00:34:58,694
So maybe you could come by after shift.

742
00:34:58,728 --> 00:35:01,130
First round...

743
00:35:01,164 --> 00:35:04,133
15% off.

744
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:07,303
Cool. I'll be there.

745
00:35:08,438 --> 00:35:11,140
Ambo's still out at that call?

746
00:35:11,174 --> 00:35:13,242
Whoa. If Dawson is gonna
report for this test,

747
00:35:13,276 --> 00:35:15,945
she needs to be en route in an hour.

748
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:23,285
[Screams]

749
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,554
I see the baby, but it's not coming.

750
00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:26,822
Let's try and get her down these stairs.

751
00:35:26,857 --> 00:35:29,358
Maybe we can get her
to the hospital in time.

752
00:35:32,162 --> 00:35:35,498
[Screams] Oh, I can feel it!

753
00:35:35,532 --> 00:35:37,900
I can feel it! You were
right. The baby's coming now.

754
00:35:37,934 --> 00:35:39,335
- Okay, let's do this here.
- [Screams]

755
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:40,736
Grace, we're gonna lie you down.

756
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:41,937
Here we go.

757
00:35:45,475 --> 00:35:47,276
Dawson, you got to get going.

758
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,879
I'm not going anywhere.

759
00:35:49,913 --> 00:35:51,947
[Groans] I can feel his head!

760
00:35:51,982 --> 00:35:53,516
Oh, he's coming out!

761
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,918
You're right, Grace. The baby's crowning.

762
00:35:55,952 --> 00:35:58,921
Dispatch, let Chicago Med know
we're gonna deliver on-site

763
00:35:58,955 --> 00:36:01,624
- and then transport.
- Copy that.

764
00:36:01,658 --> 00:36:03,425
Second watch will be
here in about 20 minutes.

765
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,960
There's no rig.

766
00:36:04,995 --> 00:36:06,729
By the time they're
suited up and ready to go,

767
00:36:06,763 --> 00:36:08,531
Dawson could be en route to the hospital.

768
00:36:08,565 --> 00:36:11,333
She'll never leave a
victim's side without backup.

769
00:36:12,936 --> 00:36:16,272
[Screams]

770
00:36:16,306 --> 00:36:18,240
Okay, Grace, give it another go.

771
00:36:18,275 --> 00:36:20,342
Keep pushing.

772
00:36:20,377 --> 00:36:23,212
[Grunting] Gah!

773
00:36:23,246 --> 00:36:25,581
- What is happening?
- I see the baby's head.

774
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,350
It's shoulder dystocia.

775
00:36:28,385 --> 00:36:30,152
Okay, Grace, the shoulder's a little stuck

776
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:31,487
right above the pelvic bone.

777
00:36:31,521 --> 00:36:34,223
What does that mean? Is
the baby going to be okay?

778
00:36:34,257 --> 00:36:36,225
The baby will be fine if you
just keep breathing. Stay calm.

779
00:36:36,259 --> 00:36:37,793
Dawson, can we do a McRoberts?

780
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:39,795
- Yeah, let's try it.
- Okay.

781
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,263
Grace, grab your leg.

782
00:36:41,298 --> 00:36:44,033
We got to get your knees as
far back as possible, okay?

783
00:36:44,067 --> 00:36:46,235
This is gonna widen your pelvis
and help the baby come out.

784
00:36:46,269 --> 00:36:47,403
Okay? Okay.

785
00:36:47,437 --> 00:36:48,437
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

786
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:49,505
On three. Here we go.

787
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:51,841
One, two, three. Push!

788
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:55,578
- [Grunting]
- Push, push, push, push, push!

789
00:36:55,612 --> 00:36:57,780
- [Screams]
- Okay, one more time.

790
00:36:57,814 --> 00:36:59,115
One more time, Grace.

791
00:36:59,149 --> 00:37:01,016
Again, one, two, three.

792
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:04,086
Push! Push, push, push, push!

793
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,390
- [Grunting]
- Push, push, push, push!

794
00:37:07,424 --> 00:37:11,127
[Laughs]

795
00:37:11,161 --> 00:37:13,596
We got him. [Gasps]

796
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,097
Her! It's a her.

797
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:18,934
[Baby crying]

798
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:25,574
Congratulations, mama.

799
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:28,277
Yeah, I know. I'm gonna miss the test.

800
00:37:28,311 --> 00:37:29,745
Yeah.

801
00:37:32,082 --> 00:37:34,183
- Hey, go.
- Mills.

802
00:37:34,217 --> 00:37:36,252
Look, I'm a certified E.M.T.
I can take over for you.

803
00:37:36,286 --> 00:37:38,120
Casey's waiting downstairs. Come on.

804
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:39,722
No, that doesn't feel right.

805
00:37:39,756 --> 00:37:43,259
I'll be all right without you, I promise.

806
00:37:43,293 --> 00:37:44,994
Go.

807
00:37:45,028 --> 00:37:46,195
Come on.

808
00:37:48,932 --> 00:37:50,833
All right. Kick butt.

809
00:37:50,867 --> 00:37:52,735
Come on. Let's go!

810
00:37:52,769 --> 00:37:54,837
- All right!
- [Overlapping shouting]

811
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:57,139
What do you think this is, a game?

812
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:59,942
- On the double!
- Let's make you a fireman!

813
00:37:59,976 --> 00:38:03,112
All right! Hit it, Joe!

814

[Horn blaring]

816
00:38:11,254 --> 00:38:13,422
How you feeling? You ready?

817
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:16,826
- Uh-huh.
- Get your coat on.

818
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,727
[Horn blaring]

819
00:38:21,264 --> 00:38:23,732
Okay, please stay in two straight lines

820
00:38:23,767 --> 00:38:26,202
until you guys get into the yard, okay?

821
00:38:26,236 --> 00:38:30,072
Come on, let's go. Two
straight lines, please.

822
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:31,407
Thank you.

823
00:38:31,441 --> 00:38:33,776
Looking good. Thank
you. Thank you very much.

824

[Chuckles] Wallace.

825
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:40,182
Hi!

826
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:44,820
I know I made some mistakes in the past,

827
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:46,989
some pretty big ones...

828
00:38:47,023 --> 00:38:50,092
and I let them get in the way and...

829
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:52,561
Stop me from just being honest with you.

830
00:38:54,798 --> 00:38:57,767
But the truth is,

831
00:38:57,801 --> 00:39:02,037
I believe that when you love somebody,

832
00:39:02,072 --> 00:39:05,374
there is only one thing to do.

833
00:39:05,408 --> 00:39:07,276
So...

834
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:10,313
my aunt... she's had this
family ring for years.

835
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:12,782
When I called her today,
she didn't let me finish.

836
00:39:12,816 --> 00:39:17,453
She just... "I can hear it in your voice.

837
00:39:17,487 --> 00:39:20,289
You're finally ready."

838
00:39:20,323 --> 00:39:22,625
So...

839
00:39:22,659 --> 00:39:25,461
[Kids gasping, murmuring]

840
00:39:25,495 --> 00:39:27,062
Ms. Donna Robbins...

841
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,635
Will you...

842
00:39:32,669 --> 00:39:34,103
marry me?

843
00:39:42,846 --> 00:39:45,047
Well, I don't have much choice.

844
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:47,550
I can't crush the hearts
of my entire class, right?

845
00:39:47,584 --> 00:39:50,052
[All cheering]

846
00:39:50,086 --> 00:39:51,420
Yes, I will.

847
00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:54,023
Okay.

848
00:39:59,062 --> 00:40:01,063
Oh, Donna.

849
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:07,536
[Siren wailing]

850
00:40:11,775 --> 00:40:14,110
Go get 'em.

851
00:40:14,144 --> 00:40:15,711
Go get 'em!

852
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,747
[Banging on truck]

853
00:40:17,781 --> 00:40:20,683
Go to it, Dawson!

854
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,587
Get up here, candidate!

855
00:40:24,621 --> 00:40:27,590
Get up here!

856
00:40:27,624 --> 00:40:29,291
Hurry!

857
00:40:31,161 --> 00:40:33,229
[Breathing heavily] I'm sorry I'm late.

858
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:39,635
You better be ready.

859
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:43,005
Go.

860
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:49,512
Up there.

861
00:40:58,855 --> 00:41:01,023
Hustle, hustle, honey. Hustle, hustle!

00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,833
that cost thousands of dollars.

168
00:07:57,835 --> 00:08:02,121
But my friend Gary, who is some
kind of engineering genius,

169
00:08:02,123 --> 00:08:06,208
modified a commercial ice maker
to do the same exact thing,

170
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,461
and we can have it for just $500.

171
00:08:08,463 --> 00:08:10,796
500...

172
00:08:10,798 --> 00:08:12,965
You gotta be kidding me. No way.

173
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:14,216
That's not gonna happen.

174
00:08:14,218 --> 00:08:16,385
Hey, Otis, you got a second, buddy?

175
00:08:16,387 --> 00:08:17,720
Hold on, Cruz. You mind?

176
00:08:17,722 --> 00:08:19,855
We're just in the middle
of something, real quick.

177
00:08:19,857 --> 00:08:22,775
What do you say, Otis? Hmm,
sound good, thumbs up?

178
00:08:22,777 --> 00:08:24,860
I guess, Herrmann and Dawson... ow!

179
00:08:24,862 --> 00:08:27,029
- Ow!
- Kind of important.

180
00:08:27,031 --> 00:08:28,698
Okay, okay.

181
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,950
Sorry.

182
00:08:30,952 --> 00:08:32,818
Otis is onboard.

183
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,453
He did not say that!

184
00:08:39,911 --> 00:08:43,379
What's the deal with you
chickening out of a blood test?

185
00:08:43,381 --> 00:08:46,082
And why do I have to hear
about it from Brett?

186
00:08:46,084 --> 00:08:47,383
You can't come to me?

187
00:08:47,385 --> 00:08:48,968
Brett's blowing the whole
thing out of proportion.

188
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,720
It's not a big deal.

189
00:08:50,722 --> 00:08:52,638
So you took the blood test?

190
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,923
I didn't need to.

191
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:56,926
The bruises went away on
their own; it's all good.

192
00:08:56,928 --> 00:09:00,813
But next rash or sniffle I get,
you'll be the first to know.

193
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,107
All clear.

194
00:09:11,109 --> 00:09:12,575
You're in good shape, buddy.

195
00:09:12,577 --> 00:09:14,660
Hey, way to go!

196
00:09:14,662 --> 00:09:17,613
Yeah!

197
00:09:17,615 --> 00:09:19,582
I want blankie.

198
00:09:19,584 --> 00:09:22,868
We don't have your blanket, remember?

199
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,288
I bet we left it at your home, buddy.

200
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,374
Mom's still coming down.

201
00:09:28,376 --> 00:09:30,126
She's not in any shape to see him yet.

202
00:09:31,462 --> 00:09:32,545
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

203
00:09:32,547 --> 00:09:35,264
Dawson, DCFS is here about the boy.

204
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:41,520
Louie was being fostered by Gina Waters.

205
00:09:41,522 --> 00:09:44,357
She's not his mother.

206
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:47,643
Now I know your name! Louie.

207
00:09:47,645 --> 00:09:49,612
That's a good one.

208
00:09:49,614 --> 00:09:51,981
He's not going back there, is he?

209
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:54,316
No.

210
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:55,901
I just saw his file.

211
00:09:55,903 --> 00:09:58,120
Neighbors had called with complaints

212
00:09:58,122 --> 00:09:59,955
and we were planning to investigate,

213
00:09:59,957 --> 00:10:03,876
but unfortunately the agency is
a little overwhelmed right now.

214
00:10:03,878 --> 00:10:05,494
Where will he go?

215
00:10:05,496 --> 00:10:08,130
I'll take him to the
Stevens Center Group Home

216
00:10:08,132 --> 00:10:10,883
while we try and find him
a new foster family.

217
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:14,136
He was asking for his blanket.

218
00:10:14,138 --> 00:10:16,555
Probably left it at the apartment.

219
00:10:16,557 --> 00:10:19,508
We have plenty of
blankets at the center.

220
00:10:24,098 --> 00:10:26,015
Okay.

221
00:10:26,017 --> 00:10:27,683
Okay, Louie.

222
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,488
It's time to go with Miss Cantrell now.

223
00:10:37,161 --> 00:10:41,080
Louie, you and me are going
to go play together.

224
00:10:48,756 --> 00:10:50,790
It's gonna be okay, Louie.

225
00:10:58,833 --> 00:10:59,950
Dawson still isn't back?

226
00:10:59,975 --> 00:11:01,525
No, not yet.

227
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:05,062
Hey, Severide, I put in a
call about those new masks.

228
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,447
You didn't tell me they
cost over 2 grand apiece.

229
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:08,648
I didn't know that.

230
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,283
All the same, they'll save lives.

231
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:12,069
They're telling me there's no
money in the budget for 'em.

232
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,987
CFD already spent their
budget for the year?

233
00:11:13,989 --> 00:11:15,739
No idea.

234
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,824
You trying to get the new
thermal imaging masks?

235
00:11:17,826 --> 00:11:19,409
Those things are incredible, Chief.

236
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:22,079
Look, I'm just telling you
what Chief Barr told me.

237
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,580
Barr is the chief of
Apparatus and Equipment??

238
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,415
That guy earned his rank riding a desk.

239
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:27,751
He needs to talk to somebody
who eats smoke for a living.

240
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:31,922
And what can go wrong?

241
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:35,392
- Hey.
- There you are.

242
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:36,977
How was it?

243
00:11:36,979 --> 00:11:39,563
Whole thing turned into a
DCFS mess at the hospital.

244
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,682
The boy, Louie, he was a foster kid.

245
00:11:42,684 --> 00:11:43,900
Poor guy.

246
00:11:43,902 --> 00:11:46,436
Hey, you did great with
him at the scene, Dawson.

247
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:49,189
You kept him nice and calm.
Ain't easy to do.

248
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:51,024
I tried.

249
00:11:51,026 --> 00:11:54,277
He kept crying for his blanket
he left back at the apartment.

250
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:56,246
Kid's been moved around so much,

251
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,281
it's probably the only
real belonging he's got.

252
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,087
Let's take a ride.

253
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:05,872
Come on, guys.

254
00:12:05,874 --> 00:12:08,842
We dive out onto the aerial,
a couple seconds later,

255
00:12:08,844 --> 00:12:10,710
boom, the roof gives way.

256
00:12:10,712 --> 00:12:11,962
The whole top floor is toast.

257
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,630
I'm lucky to be sitting here right now.

258
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:15,432
What was behind the bed?

259
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:19,636
The point is, we would
have got out of there

260
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:22,272
a hell of a lot sooner if
we had had these masks.

261
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:25,358
Look, I know you guys like to
have the newest, shiniest toys,

262
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,060
but those things cost an arm and a leg.

263
00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:28,979
Chief, I'm talking about technology

264
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:32,149
that's gonna save lives...
firefighters and civilians.

265
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,533
I understand.

266
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:35,452
But I'm telling you that
the money isn't there.

267
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,654
How can the budget be maxed out?

268
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:38,989
We're not even halfway through the year.

269
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,958
I haven't heard of any major
new equipment allocations.

270
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,660
Well, Lieutenant, there's
a lot you don't know

271
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:45,712
about how budgets and allocations work.

272
00:12:45,714 --> 00:12:48,415
Why don't you help me understand?

273
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:50,667
You got an alderman in
your house now, don't you?

274
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:52,052
Why are you breaking my balls?

275
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:53,637
Get him to explain it to you.

276
00:12:56,341 --> 00:12:57,757
Thanks for your time, Chief.

277
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,342
You got it, Kelly.

278
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,515
So listen, Herrmann, I
think that it's something

279
00:13:05,517 --> 00:13:08,451
you should at least be considering.

280
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:11,321
I read an article, and
the thing is, I mean,

281
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,690
have you seen the stats on U.S.
beer consumption?

282
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:17,410
It's way down, whereas
cocktails are way up!

283
00:13:17,412 --> 00:13:19,362
Read about that. It's confounding.

284
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,283
Hey, you're gonna need a tiebreaker.

285
00:13:23,285 --> 00:13:24,918
Right?

286
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,204
Come on, Dawson, help a sister out.

287
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,039
Yeah, sure. Sounds good.

288
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,124
Say hey to Louie for us.

289
00:13:35,097 --> 00:13:36,880
Dawson's onboard.

290
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,548
She didn't say that.

291
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,103
This is so thoughtful of you.

292
00:13:43,105 --> 00:13:45,639
Well, Louie seemed pretty attached.

293
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:47,057
I noticed.

294
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,775
He didn't take his eyes off of you.

295
00:13:48,777 --> 00:13:51,194
Oh, I... (LAUGHS)

296
00:13:51,196 --> 00:13:52,696
I meant to the blanket.

297
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:55,699
Oh, yes.

298
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:59,569
Well, I'll make sure he gets
it for bedtime tonight.

299
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:01,154
Great.

300
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,911
Um...

301
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,496
he doesn't have any family?

302
00:14:09,498 --> 00:14:11,381
None on record.

303
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,582
Birth mom was an addict,

304
00:14:12,584 --> 00:14:14,251
gave him up when he was an infant.

305
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,502
Damn.

306
00:14:15,504 --> 00:14:17,254
Kid can't catch a break.

307
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,756
Because of what he's been through,

308
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:22,342
he's going to need special attention,

309
00:14:22,344 --> 00:14:25,312
so he might be difficult to place,

310
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:29,516
but he's still young
enough, he's got a shot.

311
00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:31,234
We'll do our best.

312
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:34,487
Hope so.

313
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:36,106
He deserves that.

314
00:14:40,445 --> 00:14:42,662
Okay, wait a minute. I-I'm sorry.

315
00:14:42,664 --> 00:14:44,114
I'm not understanding the metaphor.

316
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,365
What did we do wrong?

317
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:47,450
Okay, we tried to handle
this the easy way.

318
00:14:47,452 --> 00:14:49,920
We sent in our drones.
They missed the target.

319
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,756
So now it's time to put
boots on the ground.

320
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,125
If he said the bruising has gone away...

321
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:56,593
I don't buy it.

322
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:58,795
Otis gets a hangnail, he doesn't
shut up about it for a week.

323
00:14:58,797 --> 00:14:59,879
This he says is nothing?

324
00:14:59,881 --> 00:15:02,882
Okay, how do we put the
boots on the ground?

325
00:15:02,884 --> 00:15:05,769
We bring in the Green Berets.

326
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,024
Baba?

327
00:15:11,026 --> 00:15:12,442
Baba.

328

Your body is low on platelets,

so your blood isn't clotting properly,

448

Hey, Otis, buddy, what are you doing?

657
00:35:33,678 --> 00:35:34,727
Throwing out all the junk food.

658
00:35:34,729 --> 00:35:36,645
Oh, hey, man! Not the Dingers!

659
00:35:36,647 --> 00:35:39,682
Especially the Dingers.

660
00:35:39,684 --> 00:35:41,600
(SIGHS)

661
00:35:41,602 --> 00:35:43,769
I'm not gonna take this
thing lying down, Cruz.

662
00:35:43,771 --> 00:35:45,488
(SIGHS)

663
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,857
I'm gonna beat this thing.

664
00:35:50,695 --> 00:35:53,079
Well, I'm right there with you, Otis.

665
00:35:53,081 --> 00:35:55,331
We're gonna beat this thing together.

666
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:57,333
Awesome, man.

667
00:35:57,335 --> 00:35:59,201
Grab your Nikes. We're going for a run.

668
00:35:59,203 --> 00:36:02,588
Ooh, we are gonna beat
this thing together

669
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,707
as soon as you get back
from your run, huh?

670
00:36:04,709 --> 00:36:07,927
(LAUGHING) Okay, cool.

671
00:36:10,798 --> 00:36:11,881
I love you, brother.

672
00:36:11,883 --> 00:36:13,799
- Love you too.
- (WRAPPER CRINKLING)

673
00:36:18,439 --> 00:36:21,273
I appreciate your passion.

674
00:36:21,275 --> 00:36:23,142
But when you apply to
be a foster parent,

675
00:36:23,144 --> 00:36:26,645
it takes four to six months
just to get approved.

676
00:36:26,647 --> 00:36:29,648
We can't let Louie stay in
a group home that long.

677
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,534
We need to find him a family now.

678
00:36:31,536 --> 00:36:33,235
Isn't there some way I can...

679
00:36:33,237 --> 00:36:34,620
I don't know, speed up the process?

680
00:36:34,622 --> 00:36:36,872
I'm a firefighter, my
brother's a policeman.

681
00:36:36,874 --> 00:36:38,324
He knows tons of people at DCFS.

682
00:36:38,326 --> 00:36:39,742
Maybe that'll help?

683
00:36:39,744 --> 00:36:41,327
I'm sorry.

684
00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:43,412
If you want to put in an application,

685
00:36:43,414 --> 00:36:46,048
there are always children
in need of homes,

686
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:48,083
but realistically,

687
00:36:48,085 --> 00:36:50,586
there's no way you'll be
able to foster Louie.

688
00:36:55,476 --> 00:36:57,843
I'm not really good at
taking no for an answer.

689
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,597
Can I pay him a visit now?

690
00:37:04,018 --> 00:37:05,234
Go ahead.

691
00:37:30,795 --> 00:37:33,796
Hey, Louie.

692
00:37:33,798 --> 00:37:36,048
I'm Gabby, remember?

693
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:41,804
Okay if I hang out with you a little?

694
00:37:58,456 --> 00:38:00,072
(GASPS)

695
00:38:00,074 --> 00:38:03,742
"Corduroy"? I love this book.

696
00:38:05,496 --> 00:38:07,129
Will you help me read it?

697
00:38:10,334 --> 00:38:12,334
"Corduroy is a bear

698
00:38:12,336 --> 00:38:18,007
"who once lived in the toy
department of a big store.

699
00:38:18,009 --> 00:38:23,262
"Day after day he waited with
all the other animals and dolls

700
00:38:23,264 --> 00:38:27,349
"for somebody to come
along and take him home.

701
00:38:37,528 --> 00:38:39,778
"The store was always
filled with shoppers

702
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,164
"buying all sorts of things.

703
00:38:46,203 --> 00:38:50,289
But no one ever seemed to want a
small bear in green overalls."

704
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:52,041
That's a bear right there.

705
00:38:52,043 --> 00:38:54,760
Yeah, there is!

706
00:39:01,385 --> 00:39:03,385
All right.

707
00:39:03,387 --> 00:39:04,470
Come on.

708
00:39:04,472 --> 00:39:07,222
Come on, you bastard.

709
00:39:07,224 --> 00:39:08,440
Come on!

710
00:39:17,618 --> 00:39:20,152
Where are your guys?

711
00:39:20,154 --> 00:39:21,654
Smoke break?

712
00:39:21,656 --> 00:39:25,741
Yeah, yeah, I mean... you...
you know how it goes.

713
00:39:25,743 --> 00:39:28,794
Union regulations.

714
00:39:28,796 --> 00:39:30,913
Use a hand?

715
00:39:30,915 --> 00:39:33,499
No, I-I got this.

716
00:39:33,501 --> 00:39:34,967
Mm-hmm.

717
00:39:37,088 --> 00:39:38,087
Wow.

718
00:39:38,089 --> 00:39:39,922
You are something.

719
00:39:39,924 --> 00:39:42,091
How so?

720
00:39:42,093 --> 00:39:43,592
'Cause you act like you
don't give a damn,

721
00:39:43,594 --> 00:39:47,062
and then you're the one who
goes and yells at CFD brass,

722
00:39:47,064 --> 00:39:51,684
or comes and helps a
damsel in distress...

723
00:39:51,686 --> 00:39:53,485
Yeah, well, you got me all figured out.

724
00:39:53,487 --> 00:39:55,487
Yeah, I know.

725
00:39:55,489 --> 00:39:56,689
Except one thing.

726
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:59,658
What's that?

727
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,945
When I'm married, you
break into my house

728
00:40:02,947 --> 00:40:07,866
with flowers and champagne,
and then I'm solo,

729
00:40:07,868 --> 00:40:13,205
and you just keep a nice, safe distance.

730
00:40:15,626 --> 00:40:17,793
So...

731
00:40:17,795 --> 00:40:21,263
I was thinking that we could
put the first coat of mud,

732
00:40:21,265 --> 00:40:23,349
and let it dry...

733
00:40:23,351 --> 00:40:25,551
- Next coat tomorrow?
- And then... yeah, exactly.

734
00:40:25,553 --> 00:40:26,769
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

735
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:28,887
You know, assuming I can
ever get this sheet up.

736
00:40:28,889 --> 00:40:30,022
Well, between the two of us?

737
00:40:30,024 --> 00:40:31,690
Come on, piece of cake.

738
00:40:51,219 --> 00:40:54,328

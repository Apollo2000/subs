There's like this circle of trust.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,088
And you're way on the outside of it.

3
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:06,673
Lieutenant, send me down.

4
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:11,302
You look like the kind of firefighter
we want here at 51.

5
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:13,721
Keeler's still out there somewhere.

6
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,223
He ain't out there anymore, Otis.

7
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:18,101
Gabriela Dawson.
I'm dispatcher Ramsey.

8
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:19,560
I'm here for that beer you owe me.

(GRUNTS)

10
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,774
Would you want your only daughter
to be a firefighter?

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,318
Give her the boot.
She's moving over to headquarters.

12
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:32,156
- HERRMANN: Seriously, it'll be great.
- MOUCH: Oh yeah. Great, just great.

13
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,825
What's up?

14
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,745
Mouch got a "Dear John"
letter from Mari in Japan.

15
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,790
- It's over.
- (WHISPER) They were still together?

16
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,543
MOUCH: Serves me right.

17
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:47,588
Thinking I could make it work
when we were 6,200 miles apart.

18
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:51,342
Apparently the new guy
is a game show host.

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,679
How am I supposed
to compete with that?

20
00:00:58,517 --> 00:00:59,809
Hey.

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,275
You'll rally, Mouch.
I know you will.

22
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:15,241
Even I could have
done better than that.

23
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,869
It was good advice.

24
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:23,958
Thank you. It's not mine.

25

- Lindsay? The detective chick?
- Yeah.

26
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,927
Why don't you answer? Maybe she's
calling about Keeler's disappearance.

27
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,095
The case is closed.

28
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,139
Well, maybe she's calling
on a more social level.

29
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:41,184
I like that girl for you.
She's got swagger, that husky voice.

30
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,560
You going to call her back?

31
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:45,646
I don't know. Maybe.
If she plays her cards right.

32
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,733
Listen to you.

(IMITATING HOWLING)

34
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:54,739
Come on, Pouch.

35
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,949
Oh! Come on, come on,
yeah, come on.

36
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,534
She was howling at the TV
the other day.

37
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,411
I was the only one here
and nobody believes me.

38
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:04,248
Oh, I was, uh,
I was letting that finish.

39
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,375
Oh, it's almost done.
Hey, I've been meaning to ask,

40
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:08,920
are you going to re-take the test,
now that the foot's better?

41
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:12,089
Yeah, I just actually signed up for a
couple training sessions at the Academy

42
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,424
to get ready for the physical.

43
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,926
Good luck.

44
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,474
- You two warming up?
- No.

45
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,184
But I still think it's wrong

46
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,269
that she has no idea
you're going to sideline her.

47
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,606
I wish there was something
I could do about that, but I told you

48
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,608
her dad is too far up
the food chain.

49
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,068
Mm-hmm.

50
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:34,946
What does that mean?

51
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:40,159
It means you are
the most amazing man I know.

52
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,536
Mmm.

53
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,622
I've seen you handle far tougher
obstacles than a man in a white shirt.

54
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,917
Where's Clarke today?

55
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:51,087
Uh, he switched out a few shifts
for some army buddy's wedding.

56
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,713
- He'll be back in a week.
- A week?

57
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,091
Seems like a long time to sub out.

58

Jones, look, Clarke is a great guy.

59

And I say this from experience,
you don't want to get involved

60
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:07,395
with someone in house.
Especially when you're new.

61

about getting involved?

help me in that department?

161
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,039
Let me put some thought into it,

162
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,876
um, but I got to get
the rig cleaned up.

163
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,796
OK.

164
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,014
Oh...

165
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,017
So, if I ask you how you're doing,

166
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,810
are you going to tell me
you're fine again?

167
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,271
I mean, just give me a heads up.
I don't want to waste my breath.

168
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:31,982
I'm just trying to bury it.

169
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:34,318
That's what we do, right?

170
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,404
Make jokes, get over it?

171
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,620
You know, I spent my
whole life watching my dad.

172
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:49,208
Dreaming about what it'd be like
fighting fires.

173
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,293
Saving people.

174
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:56,632
Yeah. I mean, I don't mean to wallow.
I hate wallowers.

175
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:59,593
Look, Jones, I've been there.

176
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,721
Those first few calls,

177
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:06,475
when it hits you that you're
not going to save everyone,

178
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:10,145
that someone's going to die
on your watch no matter what you do.

179
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,232
I didn't take it easy, either.
Trust me.

180
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,319
Yeah. Maybe I'm just
not cut out for this.

181
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,614
Maybe not.

182
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,326
I'm not saying that I know.

183
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,038
But it's not about how you feel
right now.

184
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,374
It's about how you move on.

185
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:36,422
- Make jokes, get over it.
- Oh, whatever it takes.

186
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,884
Look, we've got two great lieutenants
here at 51

187
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,430
and my advice is that
you should follow their lead.

188
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:57,276
Jones was pretty shaken up
on that call this morning, huh?

189
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,529
Yeah. Maybe she's not the ice queen
I thought she was.

190
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,990
I wouldn't go that far.

191
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,453
What the hell?
What is that?

192
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,413
Do not tell me that's a mouse!

193
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,501
Let me see. It's not alive,
whatever it is.

194
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,503
Come on, be careful.

195
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,049
The little girl
that Herrmann carried,

196
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:23,760
she was holding this
when they brought her over to our rig.

197
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,263
She must've dropped it.

198
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,141
RAMSEY: Main to 61.

199
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,689
Main to 61.

200
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:40,986
(SIGHS) This is 61, what's up, Main?

201
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,779
Took a while for 61 to get back

202
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,616
after you dropped the girl
at Chicago Med, you OK?

203
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,743
(WHISPERING) How does he
know how long it took us?

204
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,749
Ramsey, I said I wanted
to keep it focused on work.

205
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,709
Not comfortable with
the personal questions.

206
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,128
Copy that. My bad.

207
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,173
Good for you.
That'll teach him to shut up.

208
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,759
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

209
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,011
It's not for me.
Never for me anymore.

210
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:09,348
Oh, it could be my
Academy trainer. Hello?

211
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,808
RAMSEY: Gabby, how could
you do that to me?

212
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,186
Ramsey?

213
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:20,359
You and me, we're connected
in ways you don't understand.

214
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,659
That was creepy.
Calling from inside the house creepy.

215
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,118
I'll take care of it.

216
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:32,162
OK, you guys are
not going to believe this.

217
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,830
So, this guy...

218
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:36,959
We found the little girl's
stuffed animal from 47th Street.

219
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,462
I thought maybe we could clean it up
and send it over to the hospital.

220
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,257
Yeah, I can do a run,
see how they're doing.

221
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,758
Great.

222
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,052
I'll come with.

223
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,638
All right, I'll clean it.

224
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,600
Why didn't you tell Casey
what happened with the dispatcher?

225
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,061
Uh, it's been a rough day, so I'm
just going to file a complaint

226
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,772
with the OEMC.
That should take care of it.

227
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,817
Yeah, it sounds good.
But is everything OK with Casey?

228
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,610
Yeah. No, no,
it's not a big deal.

229
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,238
I just don't want him to do
that whole protective boyfriend thing.

230
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,698
- You know?
- Oh, yeah.

231
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,366
But you know what would be great,

232
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,493
is if we did that girls' weekend
we talked about.

233
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,453
Just you and me and a few days
away from all this.

234
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,457
Yes. Yeah, absolutely.
Let's do it.

235
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:24,214
- How's the family doing now?
- Physically they're fine.

236
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,216
Uh, Mrs. Brooker
was released last night,

237
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,801
but she stayed here with the kids.

238
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,428
Their CO2 levels are stable,

239
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,680
so they're going to be going home
before the end of today.

240

Oh, thanks.

243
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,605
We won't take up any more
of your time.

244
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,523
Medics found this
in the back of the ambulance.

245
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,734
- It belongs to the little girl.
- Caroline.

246
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:49,072
Let me tell Mrs. Brooker you're here,
maybe you can bring it back to her.

247
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,490
Yeah. Sure.

248
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,458
I'm sorry, but
Mrs. Brooker feels...

249
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:00,959
Are you the ones who were there?

250
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,754
- Yeah.
- How can you come here?

251
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,716
If you'd gotten us out sooner,
my children would still have a father.

252
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,718
Ma'am, we're very
sorry for your loss.

253
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,099
I'll bring this to Caroline.
I don't want you near her.

254
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:24,399
Uh, the family's doing
well, physically.

255
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,486
Uh, the family's doing
well, physically.

256
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,780
But, the mother's pretty shaken.

257
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,406
Understandable.

258
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,827
Listen, if you have a sec,
Chief, I...

259
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,372
I wanted to talk to
you about Jones.

260
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,834
What's on your mind?

261
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,005
Are we really going to ding her
because her father wants us to?

262
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,424
I'm having a hard time with this.

263
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,886
Chief Jones put us
in an untenable position.

264
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,680
And I really wish he hadn't.

265
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,523
- Hello.
- Mouch! Hi.

266
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:07,693
You avoided me all last shift.

267
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,363
- I wasn't avoiding you.
- Yes, you were.

268
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:14,825
You think I'm a lost cause
when it comes to women.

269
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:19,413
What? Not at all.
I, um, honestly,

270
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,581
I don't think I'd do
a very good job at it, you know?

271
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,751
I mean, we don't really
know each other all that well.

272

OK, well, ask away. I'm an open book.

your perfect woman?

275
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,599

so I would never act on this,

00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,980
Your arm's going to be OK.
You have blood flow.

314
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,898
I owe you one, Lieutenants.

315
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:56,820
Hey, Chief.

316
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:05,245
I just got off the phone
with Chuck Ewing at OEMC.

317
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:08,790
You filed a report
against one of their dispatchers?

318
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,334
(EXHALES) Yes, sir.

319
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,880
Why would you not mention that to me?

320
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,801
Uh, I wanted to keep
the situation private.

321
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,762
Well, next time you go through me.

322
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:24,890
Yes, sir.

323
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:27,517
Because right now you're in
a he-said, she-said situation

324
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,519
with this Victor Ramsey.

325
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,104
What does that mean?

326
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,358
Apparently he's one of their top men
and he's denying harassment.

327
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:40,071
I'm told the tapes don't indicate
much more than a few personal "Hellos,"

328
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,365
which he's been told to stop,
by the way.

329
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,117
He was calling
me on my cell phone!

330
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,994
He claims it was a social call

331
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,663
and that he met up with you for a beer
last week at your request.

332
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,706
Is that true?

333
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:51,917
(SIGHS)

334
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,296
Yes.

335
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,465
Did he threaten you?

336
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,680
Well, he has gotten a warning.

337
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,891
But that is the best
that we can do right now.

338
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,521
Yes, sir. I get it.

339
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,613
I don't get it.
So, he's good at his job,

340
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,615
so he's allowed to get away
with being personal

341
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:24,991
and crazy with female EMTs?

342
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,493
It's just stalker behavior.

343
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,787
Are they going to wait
for him to actually hurt somebody

344
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,872
before they do anything about it?
It's ridiculous!

345
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,208
- DAWSON: Exactly.
- Who's stalking?

346
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,713
Uh, this wackadoo dispatcher, Ramsey.
He got all weird with Dawson

347
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,841
and they're not going to do anything
about it over at OEMC.

348
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:42,968
(SIGHS)

349
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,429
Do you want me
to talk to my dad?

350
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,806
No, no, no, no, no, no.

351
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:50,058
There's no reason to pull
any favors from your dad on this.

352
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:52,477
I'm sure it'll just
work itself out.

353
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,229
Right. But thank you.
That, that's nice.

354
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:55,981
Yeah, thanks.

355
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:58,733
OK. Well.

356
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,570
Let me know
if you change your mind.

357
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:14,874
Hey, um, how was that firefighter,
the good Samaritan guy?

358
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:18,044
Uh, he had mobility in the arm
when we dropped him off, looked good.

359
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,880
But that injury he was talking about,
that knocked him off the job?

360
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,173
That was
four years ago.

361
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:26,261
- So, the painkillers he's on...
- He's been on those a long time.

362
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,222
Severide, Shay,

363
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:33,059
you gather everyone up and tell them
to meet me in the common room.

364
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:41,026
BODEN: OK. Uh, look.

365
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,778
I know it's end of shift
and y'all are anxious to get home.

366
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,282
But I wanted you
all to hear this from me.

367
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,701
Unfortunately Mrs. Brooker,

368
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:52,495
the woman who lost her husband
at the 47th street fire...

369
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:56,958
She is charging the CFD
with wrongful death.

370
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,295
What's that mean?

371
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:02,922
It means she's pinning
his death on us.

372
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,013
OK.

373
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:49,427
- What?
- Hey, uh, it's Bloom, right?

374
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,262
Yeah.

375
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,642
Oh, you're the Squad Lieutenant,
pulled me out from underneath that car.

376
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,435
Yeah, Kelly Severide.

377
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:00,939
This is temporary.

378
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:03,566
Oh, vintage airstreams,
these things are nice.

379
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,735
Yeah, well, this one could use
refurbishing.

380
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,445
I'm only drawing
a partial severance,

381
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,656
so I can't really afford
to put any money in it.

382
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,616
Hey, thanks for saving my arm.

383
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:14,285
My chances of getting back on the job
would've been zero

384
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,287
if I'd been left with a stump, so...

385
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,251
Seeing what you did
to help that lady,

386
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,336
being able to get
you out, it, uh...

387
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,713
It meant a lot to us.

388
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,926
It's been, um,
it's been a rough week.

389
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,680
A fellow firefighter is a brother
no matter what the city.

390
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,057
If you ever want to come by 51,
we'd be glad to have you.

391
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:41,229
You know, I got a pot on the stove
and I need to get back to it.

392
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:44,816
- So, uh, you take care.
- Yeah. Sure.

393
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,361
You too.

394
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:57,203
So, Chief Boden said we have to go in
for the deposition tomorrow.

395
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,831
That's pretty quick.

396
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:01,457
It's a preliminary meeting.

397
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:04,544
Does anybody mind if I use
one of these lawyers as a latrine?

398
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,172
- 'Cause that's what they deserve...
- Herrmann. I'm eating.

399
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:09,048
All right. Sorry.

400
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:13,720
Hey, Mouch. So, let's talk about
potential prospects for you.

401
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,433
Yeah, 'cause that
ain't going to happen.

402
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,687
I realize that. Like I said,
she's currently involved.

403
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:28,193
Kendra has a friend who met
this great guy on this website

404
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,446
and they're engaged and I thought
you should check it out.

405
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,911
Golden Oldeez dot com?

406
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,164
This is for the
nursing home set.

407
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,959
- Hmm? No, it's not.
- Kendra's friend's 60.

408
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,669
You think I'm 60?

409
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:51,424
No! Uh-uh. No way.
How old are you?

410
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,551
Golden Oldeez.

411
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,307
Hey, hey, how old is Mouch?

412
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:00,808
My age.

413
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:04,646
Hmm.

414
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:07,815
Hey, the apartment's ours.

415
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:10,401
That's fantastic.

416
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,487
We just have to meet the
landlord tomorrow at 3:00,

417
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,405
show him we're
not serial killers.

418
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,659
Oh! Damn. I'm meeting the trainer
tomorrow at the Academy.

419
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:19,619
- Just push it to next week.
- I can't.

420
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,247
I got to get as much time as I can
get from this guy before the test.

421
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:23,915
I'll help you work out
this weekend.

422
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:26,251
It's not the same.
It's drills with other candidates.

423
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:27,794
All right.

424
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:32,548

"Are you getting divorced?

Look at him! He's crazy!
My leg is broken!

What took you so long? Time is money
on my job! I cannot just sit here.

somebody in front of him.

00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,059
Our candidate's food almost
passes as edible these days.

467
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:49,477
No, I'm good.

468
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,521
You got lady firefighters
in Denver, Bloom?

469
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,940
Yeah. A few, sure.

470
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,025
You miss being on the job?

471
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:58,486
Yeah.

472
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:01,030
MOUCH: Some things I bet you don't miss.

473
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,741
We just got hit
with a wrongful death lawsuit

474
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,869
for a guy who was dead
way before we got there.

475
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,746
It was a sad situation actually.

476
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:11,916
The father laid down
on his whole family

477
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:13,835
and ended up saving their lives.

478
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:18,381
That guy was, uh, in pretty bad shape
by the time we got him out.

479
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,806
Thanks for the welcome, fellows,
but I just noticed the time.

480
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:30,059
- I got a doctor's appointment.
- Uh, is it close?

481
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,353
Why don't you stop by afterward?

482
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,689
Uh, no, it's all the way
across town. Thanks, though.

483
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,236
Guy hasn't been to a firehouse
in four years,

484
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,280
why the hell you got to bring up
the lawsuit, Mouch?

485
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,783
Didn't realize the topic
was off limits, Lieutenant.

486
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:50,663
Next time I'll talk pros and cons
of portable extinguishers.

487
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,255
Oh! My bad.

488
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:02,633
Hey, I saw you talking to Jones,
earlier, is she OK?

489
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:03,968
Oh, yeah, she'll be fine.

490
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:07,805
Where you headed? Night jog?

491
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,640
I left my bag in the car.
I'm gonna go grab it.

492
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,908
Gabby, I'm,
I'm sorry if I scared you.

493
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,203
What are you, what are you
doing here, Ramsey?

494
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,914
I just wanted to talk
to you in private. I'm sorry.

495
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,582
I knew you wouldn't
take my calls.

496
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:37,084
I barely know you.
Why are you calling me?

497
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:39,504
The thing is, when I started
working in your district

498
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,672
I saw you a couple of times
in the street cam

499
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:45,593
and you reminded
me of a good friend

500
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:49,722
and she died a while back,
a car accident.

501
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,558
So, I guess it was
nice to be reminded.

502
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:55,853
I'm sorry.

503
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,105
I wanted to help her
and I couldn't.

504
00:30:58,232 --> 00:30:59,690
So, I tried to help you.

505
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:06,322
Uh, that's her.

506
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:10,910
That's Lila.
She was a go-getter.

507
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:13,704
Tough. Fearless. Like you.

508
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,917
She thought about medical school for
a while, but she didn't have the money.

509
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,502
I bet she would've
been a good medic.

510
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,172
Maybe you two
would've been friends.

511
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:30,012
Yeah, maybe we would've.

512
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,726
I should've told you
right away. I wish I had.

513
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:40,356
Rather than freak you out
and get myself fired.

514
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,734
You were fired?

515
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,331
- Little on the snug side.
- Nah, it's fine.

516
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:02,086
Oh! She looks a lot better in a suit
than all you do.

517
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:08,593
OK.

518
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:12,221
Let's do this.

519
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:43,127
And I ordered my men
directly to the second floor,

520
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,087
where the witness
heard the children.

521
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,965
Lieutenant Casey,

522
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,676
I understand
you were the first inside.

523
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,888
Can you tell us what happened
after you went in?

524
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:59,101
(CLEARS THROAT) Yes, um,
three members of my unit

525
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,271
as well as two
from Lieutenant Severide's

526
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:05,733
entered the main floor
and proceeded immediately

527
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,902
up the stairs to
the second floor.

528
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:10,988
The door was locked,
so we had to take it down.

529
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,740
ATTORNEY: And how long
did that take?

530
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,411
CASEY: About 10 seconds, I'd say.
It was pretty quick.

531
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:19,872
ATTORNEY: And once you got inside?

532
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,170
We were at zero visibility.

533
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:32,301
Yelling for anyone to call out,
but no one did. So, uh...

534
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:37,181
We split up and I went directly
into the bedroom

535
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,642
at the west end of the hall.

536
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,644
ATTORNEY: And what happened
when you entered?

537
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:46,399
I got low and moved into the room.

538
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:50,277
And I was sweeping my arm out
when I felt something.

539
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:51,696
(SOBBING)

540
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:57,034
ATTORNEY: Go ahead, Lieutenant.

541
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,415
Uh, I'm not sure Mrs. Brooker wants
to hear this.

542
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:05,251
I'm not going anywhere.

543
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,964
ATTORNEY: Go ahead.

544
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,926
I moved closer. And, um...

545
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,806
I felt a man's arm.

546
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,018
I could tell it was burned
pretty badly.

547
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,982
I reached out further and...

548
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:36,699
I felt several small bodies
just beneath him.

549
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:42,496
I called into the radio for help.

550
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,336
When we rolled the man
off of his family...

551
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:53,257
We, uh, we felt the children moving

552
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:57,678
and, uh, we were extremely relieved.

553
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:03,934
Uh. (CLEARS THROAT)

554
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:12,777
Lieutenant Casey handed the children off

555
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:15,446
to the firefighters one by one.

556
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:17,948
Then the mother.

557
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:22,161
Then he and I lifted
Mr. Brooker together.

558
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:28,959
Mrs. Brooker...

559
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,841
I am lucky enough to work
with some of the best,

560
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,385
bravest firefighters in the world.

561
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:42,264
But what your husband did
to save his family...

562
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,062
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.

563
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:20,469
- Evening, Lieutenant.
- Hey.

564
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,472
Damn cold out tonight.
Can I come in?

565
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,974
No.

566
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:30,688
Look, I appreciate the invite
down to the station house, I do,

567
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:33,107
but I'm not the social type.

568
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,817
So, you take care of yourself.

569
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:37,027
Look, Bloom, I know
what you're going through.

570
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:41,323
- I've been there myself.
- You don't know anything about me.

571
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,825
Nothing.

572
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,202
I know something
about you, though.

573
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,496
I knew it the first time
that you pulled up here.

574
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,582
See, you are looking
for an easy save.

575
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:52,084
Oh yeah, something to make you
feel better about yourself.

576
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,712
You need to be the knight
in shining armor.

577
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:58,716
Well, do I look like
a damsel in distress? Hmm?

578
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:05,681
Then go look for your redemption
someplace else.

579
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,780
So, she's dropping the suit?

580
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,782
Yeah, forget gratitude
and appreciation.

581
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:26,535
Maybe not getting sued is good as it
gets these days.

582
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,580
I just don't understand
any of it.

583
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:35,753
People need to find meaning
when someone they love dies.

584
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,172
I get it.

585
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:40,716
Hey!

586
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:44,762
Me and Cruz, me and Cruz just signed
a lease on that great apartment.

587
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:47,389
We went to that meeting,
since you guys couldn't make it.

588
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,516
So, it's still in the family!

589
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:53,228
Oh, and you guys can
come over any time.

590
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:55,147
OTIS: Any time.

591
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,900
- Thanks, guys.
- Mmm, yeah.

592
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:06,158
Lieutenant, you did us proud
in that hearing.

593
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,785
Thanks, Mouch.

594
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:14,875
And I wanted to thank you for the good
advice the other day, about Mari.

595
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,880
You were right.
I need to rally.

596
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:27,930
"Good advice."
HERRMANN: Good advice, come on.

597
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,640
CASEY: You heard him.

598
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:32,309
- Hey, look who's here!
- Chief!

599
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:36,146
Wow! To what do we owe
this honor?

600
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,692
I was feeling some familial pride
and decided to raise a glass to 51.

601
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,652
Then it's time for another round.

602
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:44,989
(INDISTINCT LAUGHTER)

603
00:38:53,164 --> 00:39:00,045
Hey, um, Jones borrowed
some equipment off-shift

604
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,339
to practice her
swings or something.

605
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,216
Anyway, she forgot
to sign it out.

606
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:08,429
Give me the word, I'll sign
the papers and have her DQ'd

607
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:11,306
and leave it on
your desk in the morning.

608
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:18,147
Deputy District Chief Jones
does not like to be disrespected.

609
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,737
He's going to make
our lives a living hell.

610
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,789
Hey.

611
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,960
Listen, I just wanted to thank you
for reaching out to your dad.

612
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:44,214
Hey, no problem. Honestly,
kicking into action felt good.

613
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,425
And, besides,
I told you at Academy,

614
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,552
us ladies, we got to have
each other's backs.

615
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,179
I meant that.

616
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:58,270
Well, there's another favor
I have to ask.

617
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,190
This is going to
sound crazy, but, um,

618
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,567
I really need to get
that guy his job back.

619
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:05,861
It's a, it's a long story.

620
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:10,991
No problem. You know, my dad
has been surprisingly helpful lately.

621
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:14,036
Nicest he's been
to me in years.

622
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,582
He's trying to get you DQ'd.

623
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:24,046
What?

624
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:30,719
He wants you off the job

625
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,262
and he's doing everything he can

626
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,807
to make sure you get stuck
behind a desk.

627
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,312
Yo!

628
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,910
Jones!

629
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,038
Jones, slow down, come on!

630
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:02,751
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, slow down.
What's up?

631
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,591
- God! Hold on, OK?
- Come on, come back to my place.

632
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,385
Jones, Jones, I can't do that.

633
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:13,720
Just slow down and talk to me, OK?
What's up?

634
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,474
Screw you.

635
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,770
Taxi!

636
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,900
(SIGHS)

636
00:41:27,305 --> 00:42:27,406

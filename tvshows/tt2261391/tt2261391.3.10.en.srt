1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,070
- How you feeling?
- Scared.

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,900
Donna has a high risk
of life-threatening hemorrhage

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:06,900
in the third trimester.

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,900
Our baby is gonna be okay.

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,070
[device beeping]
Come on, Jason.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,210
I tried everything to save
your boy,

7
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,940
and I wish
that I could have saved him.

8
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,880
- You're dead.
- Lullo is the real deal.

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,150
You got to stay on your toes
for a while.

10
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,050
It's a lot of pressure
working together.

11
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,150
It's not the work part
that's tough.

12
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,090
It's the home part.

Peter Mills.

15
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,070
Yeah.

16
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,010
Look, I just wanted to come
down here to say

17
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,080
that I regret my behavior
the other day.

18
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,210
And I've got nothing
but respect for you

19
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,380
and what everyone does here.

20
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,090
I was upset.

21
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,790
I know
you tried to save my son.

22
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,960
Look, Mr. Lullo, you should
know that...

23
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,100
in the back of that ambulance,
your son was talking about you,

24
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,030
how important family was.

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,540
He said that you were the best
and he loved you.

26
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,980
It struck a chord with me.

27
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,840
My father died
when I was young,

28
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,880
and I know that I felt
the same way about him.

29
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,490
Thank you.

30
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,330
Hey, Lieutenant.

31
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,270
Look, I just want you to know,

32
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,210
I'm not trying to insert myself
in yours and Gabby's business.

33
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,270
Noted, Mills.

34
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,000
Matt, listen, um...

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I need to apologize.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,170
So...

37
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,000
I apologize.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,340
And you know I got
this bad habit

39
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,510
of letting words fall out
willy-nilly,

40
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,940
and I don't... I don't really
remember what I even said.

41
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,880
Hey, uh, sorry.
Chief wants a word with us.

42
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,490
Bunch of static.

43
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,590
[knock at door]
Hey, come on in.

44
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,030
Hey, I just want to let both
of you know

45
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,260
that Donna is in the red zone,
as far as the baby's arrival.

46
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,030
Hey.

47
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,530
That's great, Chief.
Congrats.

48
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,270
You guys have a name
for him yet?

49
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,100
We are keeping that
under wraps.

50
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,110
- Of course.
- [Wallace chuckles]

51
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,040
Just in case I got to get
out of here in a hurry,

52
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,010
I may not be able to bring
a relief fire chief

53
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,540
over here fast enough.

54
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,980
No problem.
We got you covered.

55
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,120
- Thank you.
- You ready to be a dad?

56
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,980
Nope, not at all.

57
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,290
[all laugh]

58
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,220
- You tell your father yet?
- Yeah.

59
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,290
He cried so hard, I nearly sent
the Orlando Fire Department

60
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,960
over to check on him.

61
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,990
[alarm blares, buzzes]
He's happy.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,590
[over P.A.] Truck 81,
 squad 3, ambulance...

63
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,000
- See you, dad.
- Get out of here!

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,400
- [Matthew and Kelly laugh] 
- Come on! What's wrong with you?

65
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,570
[siren blaring]

66

[horn blaring]

67
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,960
That's the Carlisle home,
and they haven't come out!

68
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,290
Any children?

69
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,630
We'll take the bottom floor!
Otis!

70
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,100
[window shatters]
Watch out!

71
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,530
Help!

72
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,330
- Mouch, swing the ladder!
- Copy that.

73
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,300
Get me down from here!

74
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,210
There you go.

75
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,050
[coughing]

00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,290
[grunts]

77
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,110
[grunts] Damn it!

78
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,680
Who else is inside?

79
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,050
My wife.
She was in the bathroom.

80
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,050
- Severide.
- Yeah!

81
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,050
The wife is still in
the bathroom.

82
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,750
Got it!

83
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,030
- Let's find the bathroom!
- Copy that!

84
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,030
[oxygen mask hissing]

[fire whooshing]

Call out!
Fire department!

88
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,110
- I don't see her!
- Severide!

89
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,550
This is too much!
We got to pull out!

90
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,390
Yeah! Okay!

91
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,260
All right!

Help.

00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,550
Oh.

97
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,180
Capp!

98
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,520
I got her! I see her!
Let's go!

99
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,430
Ready? Go!

100

[indistinct chatter]

Do you believe this clown?

102
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,380
Last winter we have a guy

103
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,750
literally lay across
his entire family to save them,

104
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,650
and he can't get out that window
fast enough.

105
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,190
[explosion]

106
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,770
Oh, God, is she breathing?

107
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,340
I'll get a line in.

108
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,710
I'll get the airway.

109
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,410
All right.

110
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,480
Hey, you can meet us
at Chicago Med.

111
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,750
Hey.

112
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,520
Nice save.

113
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,620
I'd like to throw the husband
back through the window.

114
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,140
Hey, Chaplain Orlovsky!

115
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,440
Great to see you,<i> Padre.</i>

116
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,710
Yeah, give me your boot there,
Christopher.

117
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,780
- What?
- Give me your boot.

118
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,820
All right!

119
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,320
I want this boot filled
by the end of the week.

120
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,790
[all grumbling]
It's always something.

121
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,860
- Come on!
- Listen up, listen up.

122
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,330
The Good Shepherd Soup Kitchen
that I run

123
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,930
has an oven that doesn't get
above 100 degrees,

124
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,870
has a kitchen that the city
is going to condemn.

125
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,240
Now, that means a lot of cold,
homeless Chicagoans

126
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,370
are gonna get turned away
during the holidays.

127
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,410
- I can't have that.
- We'll fill it up, chaplain.

128
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,580
I'll come collect
after next shift.

129
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,450
Don't let me down.

130
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,450
You, you, you,

131
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,450
yeah, you, and you.

132
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,790
Don't let him down.

133
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,890
Hey, there she is.

134
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,500
Chaplain.
Hey, good to see you.

135
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Mm.

136
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,470
Hey, can I tell you
the hardest thing about my job?

137
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,770
What's that?

138
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,970
People come to my office

139
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,310
when they're
in the deepest valley,

140
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,510
but they stop coming
once they've climbed out of it.

141
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,710
Yeah, I'm sorry.

142
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,380
I've been meaning to come by
and say hi.

143
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,420
Well, don't give it
a second thought.

144
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,520
Hey, I'm hearing great things
about you as a firefighter.

145
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,420
Oh. [chuckles] 
That's nice.

146
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,290
Everything else good?

147
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,490
[sighs]

148
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,330
One day at a time.

149
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,360
Well, keep it up.

150
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,630
You make me so proud.

151
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,770
Thanks, chaplain.

152
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,440
Don't be crying poor
on me, Capp.

153
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,450
I know what your side job
pulls in, come on.

154
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,980
You don't even know
what my side job is.

155
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,380
Sure I do.
You're a...

156
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,420
Come on, just throw a 20 in.

157
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,260
Cheap.
Come on, Cruz, pony up.

158
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,290
Every extra dollar I've got
is in Molly's truck.

159
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,390
Me too.
Don't even ask.

160
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,460
Hey, Mouch, turn it up.

161
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,600
Severide, check it out.

162
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,950
I saw she was down,

163
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,300
and something inside me
was screaming out,

164
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,030
"Do something, do something,"
you know?

165
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,770
So I picked up
the heaviest thing I could find,

166
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,500
and I threw it through
the window, and I yelled out,

167
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,060
"Over here, over here!"

168
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,610
The fire was out of control
at that point,

169
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,840
and all I could think of was,
"I have to help my wife."

170
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:43,880
The smoke was so thick...

171
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,450
- [Joe scoffs]
- I was choking on it.

172
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,450
- And, anyway, I'm thrilled...
- Oh, come on.

173
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,780
I could help alert those guys
and save my wife in time.

174
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,490
[reporter] And this was
the scene earlier

175
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,620
where the Chicago Fire
Department arrived

176
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,760
just in time to save
Veronica Carlisle,

177
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,690
but not quickly enough
to save the house.

178
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,390
Compelling story, Glenn.

179
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,500
Glad there's still some local
heroes this time of year.

180
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,300
- In other news...
- Oh, compelling story, Glenn.

181
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,400
Sir, could you tell us exactly
what happened?

182
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,900
Oh, of course, Dwight.
Well, um, my house was on fire,

183
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,670
and I nearly wet myself,
so I barreled out of a window,

184
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,480
nearly killing a fireman, while
leaving my poor wife to die.

185
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,940
Oh!
[laughter]

186
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,910
We should call the station
and tell our side of the story.

187
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,980
Who cares?
Let the guy say what he wants.

188
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,750
- Hey, hey.
- Whoo! Hey.

189
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,790
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Everything's fine.

190
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:31,960
I'm just stopping by
on my way to the Grogans.

191
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,460
Okay.
Can I get you something?

192
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,630
- A... wheelbarrow.
- [both chuckle]

193
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,430
I got one of those.
Come on.

194
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,890
Would you like some lunch?

195
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,340
I have no idea
what those guys are making.

196
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,970
No, no.
Come here.

197
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,770
[chuckles]

198
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,080
Melissa's got ten ladies
coming over

199
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,510
to look at jewelry
or something.

200
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:54,950
Don't worry.
I'm only looking.

201
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:58,420
Hey, you remember
 meeting her... Melissa?

202
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,490
They had a daughter, Samantha,
last year,

203
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,460
and when it came time
to name her,

204
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,460
they hyphenated her surname,

205
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:10,360
so it's
 Samantha Nash-McGuire.

206
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,400
And I was thinking
that maybe we could do that.

207
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,370
Terrance Robbins-Boden.

208
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,570
- Uh...
- [Donna chuckles]

209
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,440
No.

210
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,750
- "No," just like that?
- Yeah, just like that.

211
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,920
Well, maybe you should take
longer than one second

212
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,490
- to think about it.
- Donna...

213
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,620
there's no way that our child's
going to have two last names...

214
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,790
End of story.

215
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,460
Come on.

216
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,560
Look, I love you, but...

217
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,100
Bodens have just been Bodens.

218
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,670
Tradition
still means something.

219
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,140
- Okay, well...
- What?

220
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,170
I'm gonna be on my way.

221
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,640
- Oh, Donna.
- No, no, no.

222
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,450
I'll see you after shift.

223
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,560
- Great news, Herrmann.
- Hear ye, hear ye.

224
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,830
I present to you the debut
of Molly's II.

225
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,930
- I don't understand.
- It was jammed last year,

226
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,770
and there's gonna be
news coverage to boot.

227
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:25,470
Newhouse got the permits
cleared, and all we have to do

228
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:29,180
is sell Chief Hale's
energy water out of the van.

229
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,860
You guys are messing with me.

230
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,550
No, no, no, Hermie-Herm!
Not at all!

231
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,750
Molly's II is finally
in business.

232
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,730
It's everything
we dreamed about...

233
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,720
Serving great food while being
a giant billboard for your bar.

234
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,190
Did Hale say anything
about my lieutenantship?

235
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,830
Right, right, right.
Forget about it.

236
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,030
No, all right, this is great.

237
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,930
This is...
I'm really proud of you boys.

238
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,630
I am. Yeah.

239
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,210
[knock at door]

240
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,580
- Come on in, you two.
- Chief, I wanted to tell you

241
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,050
that Anthony Lullo was waiting
for me outside this morning.

242
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,150
He apologized for his actions
the other day.

243
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,890
He says he knows that we did
all that we could.

244
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,090
And you believe him?

245
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,060
I do.
And looking back,

246
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,760
I'm glad that I didn't file
a police report on him.

247
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,560
He's in deep grief,
and he deserves a pass on this.

248
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:29,270
Okay.
Glad you trusted your gut.

249
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,170
You too, Chief.

250
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,710
[clears throat]

251
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,610
Matt, can we talk?

252
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,920
Hey.

253
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,650
You know I didn't mean
what I said last night.

254
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,920
So now you remember?

255
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,290
It was just stupid bar talk,
that's all.

256
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,160
"The tough part
isn't the work part.

257
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,530
It's the home part."

258
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,300
That's what you said, right?

259
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,770
Doesn't sound like
stupid bar talk to me.

260
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,630
I mean, it sounds like you knew
exactly what you were saying.

261
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,540
Okay, I was frustrated,
I admit.

262
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,100
You bust my chops at work.
we both bring it home.

263
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,310
It affects us in ways
that aren't exactly healthy.

264
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,910
You're the one who signed up
for this...

265
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,110
- Working for your fiance.
- We both did.

266
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,950
Yeah, because I thought you
could handle it.

267
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,580
- Me?
- I'm not the one crawling back

268
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,920
to my old flame to complain
about my future spouse.

269
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,290
I didn't crawl back
to anything.

270
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,020
I watched it happen.
I heard what I heard!

271
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,590
You two...

272
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:26,830
maybe you should take
this conversation elsewhere.

273
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:30,100
Yeah, I'm done talking.

274
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,940
What is this?
50 bucks?

275
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,440
This is pathetic!

276
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,940
Okay, out of the way.
Out of the way.

277
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,950
What's this?

278
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,950
Sylvie and I have been trying
something for the holiday fest.

279
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,080
We call it Santa Bites.

280
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,020
- Wait. We do?
- Mm-hmm.

281
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,090
Santa Bites.

282
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,690
Oh, okay.

283
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,330
Wow!

284
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,960
It's turkey, potatoes and
cranberries all baked in a bun.

285
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,030
- Mmm.
- Oh, ho! Ho, ho ho, mmm!

286
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,970
Is it... a double overhead
shaka, twice in one year?

287
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,040
Yeah!

288
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,010
Damn, I hate to say it,
but this food-truck thing

289
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,880
is just what Molly's needs.

290
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,010
Aw, holy smokes!

291
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,110
Mmm!

292
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,020
You want to try it?
Don't you want to try it?

293
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,090
It's so good.

294
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,990
For the last time,
edges first.

295
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,160
Too easy.

296
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,330
Oh, will you look at this?

297
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,860
- Is that the husband?
- Yeah.

298
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,030
Can I help you?

299
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,400
Uh, I think so.

300
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,830
I was told you were

301
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:41,900
the firefighters who rescued me
and my wife.

302
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,100
Yeah, we were there.

303
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,310
Yeah, well, I just wanted
to say thank you.

304
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,010
I don't know if you saw
the news,

305
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,180
but they're telling people
I was some sort of hero,

306
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,780
which I know is the exact
opposite of what I am.

307
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,680
Uh...

308
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,950
Okay.

309
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,750
I'm Fred Carlisle.
My wife's Veronica.

310
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,090
She's still in I.C.U.,

311
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,890
but the doctors tell me
there's hope.

312
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:08,230
Well, again, thank you.

313
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,930
Yeah.

314
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,930
I see the way you guys
are looking at me.

315
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,070
I know what you must be
thinking.

316
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,070
So I want you guys to know.

317
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,910
When I was 16, I was
in the garage with my old man,

318
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,320
and this kiln we had
in there exploded.

319
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,120
All I remember is waking up
in the burn unit.

320
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,060
Spent the next eight months
in the I.C.U.

321
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,230
So, when that fire broke out
this morning...

322
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,730
I panicked.
I just... I panicked.

323
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,330
Hey, man, you don't have
to explain yourself to us.

324
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:47,870
I know, but I felt...

325
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,040
I felt...
I don't know what I felt.

326
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,040
Thanks for hearing me out.

327
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,310
Yeah, no worries.

328
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:59,410
And we're all pulling
for your wife.

329
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,020
Walk a mile, men.

330
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,450
Walk a mile.

331
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,960
Are you done with the washer?

332
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,330
What?
Oh, yeah.

333
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,800
Is there some kind of sign-in
sheet for when we can use these?

334
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:29,110
Uh, no, it's more of
a first-come first-serve.

335
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,950
You okay?

336
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,750
There's not a lot of estrogen
in this house, so...

337
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,450
if you ever want to download,
I'm here.

338
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,190
Thanks.

339
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,960
I found this shirt at the bottom
of my locker.

340
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,390
It's, um... It's from this
barbeque a couple years ago

341
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,830
when I was a paramedic

342
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,170
and Casey was engaged to this
doctor, and...

343
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,300
I remember him playing with
a couple of these kids

344
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:00,210
in the park, and...

345
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,040
I don't know.

346
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,110
I don't know, I guess
it just... Things seemed...

347
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,150
simpler.

348
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,520
Simpler?

349
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,790
The man you loved was engaged
to another woman.

350
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,990
- Yeah.
- [both chuckle]

351
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:22,030
You're gonna look back a year
from now and be on

352
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:26,100
the other side of whatever's
going on, I know that.

353
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,140
Here.

354
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,470
What's this?

355
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,980
Put it in the bottom of your
locker, and then

356
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:40,050
a year from now when you find
it, you can remember this day.

357
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,890
Sev.

358
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,830
- Plans after shift?
- Uh, home, rest.

359
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,490
Nope, you and me.

360
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,430
Good old-fashioned
Chicago bar crawl.

361
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:59,000
I can't do it, man.
I'm barely dried out

362
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,830
from the last month or so.

363
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,140
Fine.
One drink, and we'll head home.

364
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,970
- Come on.
- I'm serious.

365
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,440
One drink?

366
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,040
That's all I'm asking.

367
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,080
- Bar... 
- Go Hawks!

368
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,850
- Bartender! Hey!
- Go!

369
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:15,880
Shots for any girl who's above
a nine, all right?

370
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,020
That's so wrong.
Sexist!

371
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,020
What are you talking...
All right, hey, Tim.

372
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,020
Equality for all, all right?
six and up!

373
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,130
- Six and up!
- That's better!

374
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,960
- All right.
- Yeah.

375
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,530
So what's up, dude?
Talk to me.

376
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:34,000
Ah...
Change of pace, is all.

377
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,200
Couldn't do another night at
home talking about my feelings.

378
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,970
Well, how's everything
on that front?

379
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,270
If I wanted to talk about
my feelings,

380
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,340
- I wouldn't be in a bar...
- I get it, I get it!

381
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,380
I don't blame you, all right?

382
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,120
Hey, whoa!
Hey, not so fast.

383
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,650
Where you going so fast?
What are your names?

384
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,290
- Chloe.
- Huh?

385
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,650
- Chloe.
- Oh.

386
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,310
This is Yuma.

387
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,960
Yuma! Like the movie!
I love that movie!

388
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,130
- Like the city!
- Like the city.

389
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,930
Oh ho.
Okay, well...

390
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:04,100
- Thank you.
- You two, we're doing shots.

391
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,400
Okay, you're staying,
We're doing shots, on me.

392
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,040
Apparently you made the cut.

Yeah!

- Yes!
- Cheers, huh?

396
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,450
Cheers.
[chattering, whooping]

00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,590
all five of
these kids were born,

408

- Today what, Christopher?

409
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:16,370
Ah, today is somewhere after
all those days, honey.

Hey, buddy.
10 minutes till serving.

Hey.

00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,560
- [Matt groans]
- Ugh.

415
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,190
Only one drink, huh?

416
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,290
One thing led to another,
and...

417
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,760
ended up being
an all-night thing.

418
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,300
I tried texting you, like,
50 times.

419
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,430
Lost my phone along the way
somewhere.

420
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:49,400
Listen, I'm... I'm sorry.
I was a jerk.

421
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,770
It only took eight shots for me
to figure that out.

422
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:59,180
We can do this.
You and me.

423
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,150
You and me.

424
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,220
We'll work it out.

425
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,260
- My God, you smell so horrible.
- I'm sorry.

426
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,460
Hey. So this is it, huh?

00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,330
Ah, yeah, this is it,
Lieutenant.

It's Melissa Brosh-McKenna!

- Yeah!

430
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,700
I'm a big fan of yours.
I love your news.

431
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,710
It's the only news we watch!
Tell 'em, Cindy.

432

- He's a big fan of yours.
- Oh, thanks, so sweet.

433
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,480
Hey, this is the debut of
Molly's II, our new food truck.

434
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,620
Maybe you guys could put it in
a... You know, in a shot.

435
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:41,550
Um... why not?
Come on, let's go.

436
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,220
All right, come on Charles,
let's go.

437

- Guys!
- Come on!

438
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,290
This'll be fun, all right?

439
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:48,230
Here we go.
We're gonna go in 3-2-1.

440
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,260
We're down at the 42nd Annual
Chicago Holiday Festival,

441
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:54,230
where families have gathered for
good cheer and good eating.

442
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,370
Sir, can you tell me your name?

443
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,570
Uh, Herrmann,
Christopher Herrmann.

444
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,610
And you're saying this is
the debut of your food truck?

445
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:02,580
Uh, yeah.
That... That... That...

446
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,680
Th... That's right, that's
something we've been working on,

447
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,180
and working on, like,
three months, because, you know,

448
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:11,080
we wanted to get it perfect.
Our bar, Molly's, has

449
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,290
gone... gone mobile, and, uh,

450
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,560
that's "Molly's" with two "l"s
and a "y."

451
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,520
It's at, uh, well, uh,
1925 West Wolcott...

452
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,290
Oh my... Oh, my God.

[all yelling]

Oh, no!

No, no, no, no, no,
no, no...

00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,800
Look out!

00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,670
Save the baby!

458
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,510
Oh!

459
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:39,310
Hey, that's
the Molly's truck!

460
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,620
Morning, fellas.

461
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,260
- What?
- Seen a lot of firefighters

462
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,870
make the morning paper,
but never like this.

463
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:13,580
- Connie?
- Chief, you need something?

464
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,880
You ever been invited to a
friend's place for Thanksgiving,

465
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,280
sat down for a big, beautiful,
once-a-year meal,

466
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,150
got excited about
a perfectly-cooked turkey

467
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,420
and then they served up a ham?

468
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,560
- A ham?
- Instead of the turkey.

469
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,400
No, I got that part, but
what I'm not sure about is...

470
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,700
See?

471
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,600
Tradition is important,
is it not?

472
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,240
- I suppose it is.
- Thank you, Connie.

473
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,570
Woman that understands.
I mean... who knows

474
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:41,270
if the pilgrims ate turkey
at the first Thanksgiving?

475
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,780
Maybe they had nothing but hams
lined up for miles.

476
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,610
But me, as long I can remember,

477
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:49,420
turkey is the traditional
Thanksgiving food.

478
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,550
And gravy... brown, made from
the drippings of the turkey.

479
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:55,790
Not some fancy, foo-foo stuff
made with...

480
00:24:55,790 --> 00:25:00,260
pears
and sun-dried tomatoes.

481
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,430
I do like a good gravy.

482
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:05,530
Got to stand up
for tradition, Connie.

483
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,500
Otherwise, what do we have?

484
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,800
Ham and pear gravy.

485
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,870
Thank you, Connie.

486
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,920
Here's what I remember
from the other night.

487
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,850
Okay,
I don't remember anything.

488
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,220
Mm-hmm.

489
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,360
You had to plug your phone in.
We went to Chloe's apartment

490
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,600
near the bar,
you passed out on the couch...

491
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,700
and I didn't.

492
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,840
So, you and Chloe...

493
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,640
Uh, yeah.

494
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,810
What did...
What did you think?

495
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,680
I didn't know what to think!

496
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,550
Well, when I woke up, you were
still sawing logs on the couch.

497
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,010
So I just took off.

498
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,620
Oh, thank God.

499
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:59,590
Wait, you did...
You thought you...

500
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,250
I...

501
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,360
[laughs]

502
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,430
- So much for me drying out.
- Yep.

503
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,030
In my defense, the emergency
brake should not be right there.

504
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,250
You were suppose to chock
the tires!

505
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,470
- Mouch was supposed to do that!
- Do we even have tire chocks?

506
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:20,510
Never in all my life have
I been that humiliated.

507
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,910
- I beg to differ.
- Yeah, me too.

508
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,980
Look, any press is good press,
right?

509
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:33,420
- Yeah, except that.
- Yeah, that reads like

510
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,960
Molly's is responsible
for the death of Jesus,

511
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,020
<i> again. </i>
That truck is cursed.

512
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,560
It is not the truck's fault,
all right?

513
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,930
I gave you guys eight weeks
to make money

514
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,630
out of the name "Molly's II."
That was a challenge.

515
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:46,530
- But you never said...
- But, but, but!

516
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:51,870
- How much money have you made?
- We're just getting started!

517
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,940
You're fired.

518
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:02,480
[whistling]

519
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,670
Hey.

520
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,860
Did you know Kim Kardashian
went to an all-girls school?

521
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,860
That... explains a lot.

522
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,760
- I got you something.
- What's this?

523
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,470
It's nothing, really.
I know I jumped your case

524
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,730
a while back, and...
you stepped up.

525
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,070
I wanted to say thank you.
[alarm blares, buzzes]

526
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,540
Aww.

527
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,940
[over P.A.] Ambulance 61,
injuries from a fall.

528
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,810
- 815 South Nebraska.
- That's around the corner.

529
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:32,350
- I'll open this after the call.
- Yeah.

530
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,650
[siren blaring]

531
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:45,790
[man screaming]

532
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:57,140
[screaming in pain]

533
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,040
- Where'd you fall from?
- You fell, sir?

534
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,610
Ooh! My legs,

535
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,680
- my legs, my legs!
- Okay, deep breaths.

536
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,710
- What's your name?
- Walter.

537
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,110
Help me, help me, help me...

538
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,880
help me, help me, help me!

539
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,050
He didn't fall.
He was run over.

540
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:14,590
[screaming]

541
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,090
He's passed out from
blood loss.

542
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,130
Let's get him to Chicago Med.

543
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,930
Who's that?

544
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:38,510
Hyphenated last name.
Can you believe that?

545
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,010
So the kid, he has three names.

546
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,480
You put in the middle name,

547
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,950
that's four.
That's ridiculous.

548
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:45,050
Oh, yeah, yeah, I agree.

549
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,590
What was your mother's
maiden name?

550
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:49,120
- Um... Panchoulidze.
- Can you imagine saying

551
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,720
"Hi, I'm Brian..."
What was it?

552
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,060
- Panchoulidze.
- Panchoulidze-Zvonecek?

553
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,890
Imagine kindergarten,
writing that at the top

554
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,860
- of the damn page.
- Whoa, no, that would've been...

555
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,030
Where would you be sitting
right now?

556
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,500
- Huh?
- You? You would be

557
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,440
an accountant.
Or, uh, working in a bakery

558
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,170
- or something like that.
- Yeah, huh.

559
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:07,640
I don't... I don't know
that that would...

560
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,540
I mean, yeah, totally.

561
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,540
- Utterly asinine, right?
- Mm.

562
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,110
[swallows]

563
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,880
- Chief?
- What?

564
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,550
You and Donna...

565
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,220
You're gonna make great parents.

566
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,530
[knock at door]
Yeah.

567
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:29,060
Uh, Chief, a Mac McCoy from
the City Building Department

568
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,000
- is on the phone.
- Yeah, yeah.

569
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,800
Connie, I'll take it.

570
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,930
I...

571
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,140
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

572
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,070
Chief Boden.

573
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,780
That's what he told me,
right?

574
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,180
It was good.
Did you watch last night?

575
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,580
Hey, Kelly.

576
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,980
Fire from last shift.
City's looking to condemn

577
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,120
the structure,
want us to take a look.

578
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,690
Yeah, we'll head over there.

579
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,050
Thanks.

580
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:59,020
I'd slap the red "x" on it
if it were up to me.

581
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,930
You guys hear anything more
from the wife?

582
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:03,630
No, she's still in
the burn unit.

583
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,870
You guys know Dr. Kendra
over there?

584
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:09,540
She sometimes keeps me posted
on things.

585
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,240
Yeah, I know her.
She's a lesbian.

586
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,140
Interesting.

587
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,950
All right, yeah,
this place is done, let's get...

588
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,620
What?

589
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,260
Fire started here, and here.

590
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,900
And there.

591
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:40,830
Three different places
at the same time.

592
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,940
That son of a bitch.

593
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,000
Call OFI and the CPD, will ya?

594
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,770
On it.

595
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,850
That's him right there.

596
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,990
Mr. Carlisle?

597
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:05,060
You need to come with us.
We've got some questions.

598
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,190
Yeah, sure.

599
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,700
You were burned yourself,
buddy.

600
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,070
How the hell could you do that
to another person?

601
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:21,140
Your own wife?

602
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:36,790
Maybe we could, uh... mm.
Yeah, never mind.

603
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,230
What about...

604
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,160
Forget it.

605
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:00,910
Here you go, fellas.
Grab a spoon.

606
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,190
- Hey, chaplain!
- Ah!

607
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,150
You raised some money for us,
Christopher.

608
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,190
Yeah...

609
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:16,400
Is this the best you could do
for us, 51?

610
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:21,270
Nah, chaplain.
Not exactly.

611
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:32,310
Your new soup kitchen now has
its own set of wheels.

612
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,650
Just know the parking brake
can be a little tricky.

613
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:42,150
This is the best Christmas
gift this old chaplain's

614
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,290
- ever gotten.
- Merry Christmas, Father.

615
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:48,090
There you go, brother.
All right.

616
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,200
- Come on.
- Hey.

617
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,170
Let us show you the inside.

618
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,840
- It's all yours, Padre.
- Yeah.

619
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,880
Careful with
the parking brake!

620
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,290
Anyone heard from Mills
and Brett?

621
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,130
Nope.

622
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,230
Hey.

623
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:28,100
Does a fireman named Matt
work here?

624
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,770
Um, yeah.
Yeah, he does.

625
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,910
He left his cell phone
in my apartment.

626
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:36,040
Can you give it to him for me?

627
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,940
Excuse me?

628
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,530
Found your phone.

629
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,120
'Cause you left it at some
blonde bimbo's apartment.

630
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,850
Wait, wait.
I can explain that.

631
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,390
Great, explain it.
I'd really love to hear it.

632
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:54,460
Me and Severide, we... we went
back to that girl's apartment

633
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,100
to plug in my phone.
I fell asleep on the couch.

634
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,030
Severide is the one who slept
with her.

635
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,330
And this is how
you want to tell me?

636
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,130
Tell you what?
Nothing happened!

637
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,940
You know, Kelly really brings
out the worst in you.

638
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,410
What brings out the worst
in me is you telling Mills

639
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,370
you don't know if you want
to be with me.

640
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,110
You think an apology
was gonna fix that?

641
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,780
I thought we agreed that
we were past that!

642
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,480
Well, apparently not!

643
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:20,750
Maybe this whole thing is
too big for us.

644
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,290
I'm trying to be a lieutenant
and your fiance,

645
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:26,230
and you can't respect
either one.

646
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:36,900
Request permission to leave
shift, Lieutenant.

647
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,970
Granted, candidate.

648
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:52,250
You know, I was gonna drop it
and not say anything else.

649
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:55,390
In fact, I've kept my mouth shut
all week.

650
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:59,960
But then, I thought to myself,
"Why shouldn't I have some say

651
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,930
- in the naming of my child?"
- Donna, it's my family name,

652
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,260
it's important to me,
there are traditions involved.

653
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,530
Oh! well, some traditions
need to be put to bed!

654
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:09,100
Not this one.

655
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,970
You sound...
like some old... [gasping]

656
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,910
- What...
- ...dinosaur that can't even...

657
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,110
Hey.
What is it?

658
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,880
Oh, it's...
I think it's coming!

659
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,210
- What... What's coming?
- Oof!

660
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:21,850
Oh... Oh, God...
Can I have some help up in here?

661
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,350
- [Donna groans]
- Breathe, breathe.

662
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:26,520
- [Donna groans]
- Look at me... Breathe, breathe.

663
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,020
She's going into labor,
where are our paramedics?

664
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,390
- Uh... out.
- Where's Dawson?

665
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,160
- Went home sick.
- [Donna groans]

666
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,130
Oh, okay, I'm here!
I'm right here, baby.

667
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:37,100
Uh, uh, squad... Everyone,
let's help her, let's go.

668
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,530
- Let's go, help him carry her.
- Move!

669
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,870
[overlapping chatter]
Come on, come on, come on!

670
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:43,440
[Donna yells in pain]

671
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,000
Oh!

672
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,170
Okay, okay, okay.

673
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:49,240
[engine turns]

674
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,410
Go!

675
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:56,880
[siren blaring]

676
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:03,290

[horn honking]

679
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,240
- Oh!
- Tony, get us moving.

680
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,240
- Oh, my God!
- There's nowhere to go, Chief.

681
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,240
- Oh, my God!
- What is it?

682
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,940
- Oh, the baby's coming.
- What?

683
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:28,110
The baby is coming!
The baby's coming!

684
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,550
[horns honking]

685
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,100
[Donna yelling in pain]

686
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,590
- Okay, lay her down.
- Okay, okay, okay...

687
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,960
- Come on, baby.
- Uhh!

688
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,930
- Lay back down.
- You done this before, Chief?

689
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:43,530
More times than I can count.
Just never with my own son.

690
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,000
- Do you want me to...
- Not a chance in hell.

691
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,230
Okay, wait, wait, wait,
Wallace.

692
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,400
- I'm right here.
- Wallace.

693
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,270
I'm right here.
This old dinosaur knows

694
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,540
what he's doing,
I promise you.

695
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,140
Anyway, what's better than to
bring little Terrance

696
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,410
in the world than from
a CFD squad truck?

697
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,640
- Okay.
- Okay?

698
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:00,310
Lie back down.
Just breathe.

699
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:03,120
Okay, baby,
I can see the crown.

700
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,490
He's coming.
He's crowning.

701
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,960
Okay?
I'm gonna need you to push.

702
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,690
No, I can't do this!

703
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,960
- Yes, you can... Yes, you can.
- No, no...

704
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,130
Look at me, look at me.
It's just you and me.

705
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,160
Okay?
It's just you and me.

706
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,530
You can do this.
Come on.

707
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,370
- Okay.
- Now...

708
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,610
And... push!

709
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:27,670
[grunts]

[yells]

711
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,010
Yes!
You're doing great.

712
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:32,080
You're doing great.
Doing so good.

713
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,150
Oh, God!

714
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,550
I'm just gonna need
one more little push,

715
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:37,220
one more little push.
Okay?

716
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,720
Okay. [grunts]

717
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,620
[all] Push!

718
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,720
Oh, my God!
He's out, baby, he's out!

00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,980

- Oh...

724
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,090
Here he is.

725
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:19,020
You did good, baby.

726
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,660
- So good.
- Okay.

727
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:23,160
You did good.

728
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:31,500
[sighs]

729
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,500
Hey, Lieutenant?
We still haven't heard

730
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,310
hide nor hair of ambo
since they left this morning.

731
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,710
Yeah, this is Lieutenant Casey
at 51.

732
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:51,780
Do you guys have a location
on ambulance 61, please?

733
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,750
Okay.
You know what?

734
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,790
I'm gonna run by there
and have a look.

735
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,690
Thanks.

736
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:02,690
61 is still on scene
at 815 South Nebraska.

737
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,700
The alarm office said their
computers have been up and down

738
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,300
all day and they haven't been
able to check status.

739
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,370
- Let's go!
- Yep, load up.

Some traditions
are worth keeping.

743
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,800
Oh... Ohh!
Thank you.

[groaning]

745
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,220
- I don't want to let him go.
- It's okay.

746
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,820
Hi.

747
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:05,760
Doctor,
the baby's turning blue.

748
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,630
What's going on?

749
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,260
Wallace?

750
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,800
Respiratory distress.
Meconium aspiration.

751
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,230
- What's going on?
- Lungs aren't absorbing oxygen.

752
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,870
Wallace, what's going on?

753
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:16,170
Call respiratory and let peds
know we're on our way, now!

754
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,400
Talk to me!
You talk to me, now!

755
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,470
No!
What's happening?

There's a lot of bolts.

This thing's top-heavy.

Hey, Chief, this is Dawson.

I found a blood trail,

345
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:19,066
and I think a victim may have wandered off.

346

I'm gonna go check it out.

were on a roof next-door

flying their dad's
remote-controlled drone.

They got clipped by the

He's still down somewhere.

hit, and I've got live wires

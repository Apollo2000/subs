1
00:00:00,094 --> 00:00:02,476
Hope got into a little bit
of trouble back home.

2
00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:03,781
I didn't steal any money.

3
00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:06,843
She explained it all to me.
Small town drama.

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,834
What did HQ say about
those oxygen bottles?

5
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:11,489
I called and left
a message this morning,

6
00:00:11,516 --> 00:00:13,049
but I think I might
have the wrong number.

7
00:00:13,084 --> 00:00:15,585
Yeah, you have an explanation
for all of it.

8
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,488
Congratulations, Captain Casey.

9
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:22,526
Starting immediately Captain
Casey will be your go-to

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,761
for all personnel-related issues.

11
00:00:24,795 --> 00:00:26,329
Chief told me he'd back you up

12
00:00:26,372 --> 00:00:28,699
if you wanted to make captain yourself.

13
00:00:29,934 --> 00:00:31,701
I'm in no rush.

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,441
Impressive stack of forms on your desk.

15
00:00:38,476 --> 00:00:40,110
You having a paper drive?

16
00:00:40,136 --> 00:00:42,604
That's the paperwork I get to
deal with thanks to these.

17
00:00:42,647 --> 00:00:45,882
I was thinking of giving up
bacon for health reasons,

18
00:00:45,917 --> 00:00:48,142
but Trudy has two rules for men.

19
00:00:48,307 --> 00:00:50,809
No cats, and no vegetarians.

20
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,644
I'd add sandals to that list.

21
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,479
If we put together a list
like that for women,

22
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:56,614
you would murder us.

23
00:00:56,649 --> 00:00:59,451
That's not true. Try it.

24
00:01:00,986 --> 00:01:02,420
Do not.

25
00:01:02,455 --> 00:01:04,856
Oh, no, please. I'm interested.

26
00:01:07,626 --> 00:01:09,461
Um...

27
00:01:09,495 --> 00:01:11,362
- Maybe just...
- Come on, Otis.

28
00:01:11,397 --> 00:01:13,264
What's on the list?

29
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:16,634
No... racists?

30
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,003
Is that a question?

31
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:21,673
You're not sure?

32
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:24,342
- Never had a chance.
- Mm-mm.

33
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,944
Hey.

34
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:28,713
Oh!

35
00:01:28,747 --> 00:01:30,615
What a nice welcome.

36
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:32,350
Yeah, nothing cheers up
this crowd like paychecks.

37
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:33,952
- Sylvie Brett, there you go.
- Thank you.

38
00:01:33,986 --> 00:01:36,287
- Matthew Casey.
- Yep.

39
00:01:36,322 --> 00:01:38,289
Hey your first Captain's paycheck.

40
00:01:38,324 --> 00:01:40,024
Oh, must be nice.

41
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:42,460
Christopher Herrmann.

42
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:45,463
There you go, Kelly.

43
00:01:45,498 --> 00:01:46,731
Happy payday, everyone.

44
00:01:46,765 --> 00:01:48,299
Thank you.

45
00:01:48,334 --> 00:01:49,968
Uh... forgot someone.

46
00:01:50,002 --> 00:01:51,870
Oh, there wasn't a check
in the package for you,

47
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:54,038
so I figured you must
have direct deposit.

48
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:57,876
Nope, I get a check every
week, just like everyone else.

49
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,644
Or at least, I did until today.

50
00:01:59,678 --> 00:02:01,513
I'm not sure what happened,

51
00:02:01,547 --> 00:02:03,581
but I'll call over to payroll right now.

52
00:02:03,616 --> 00:02:05,850
I'm really sorry about that.

53
00:02:08,621 --> 00:02:11,022
Don't worry. She'll find it.

54
00:02:12,892 --> 00:02:16,528
Hey, yo, you're blocking
emergency vehicles here!

55
00:02:16,562 --> 00:02:19,364
Deliveries go around back
to the kitchen door!

56
00:02:19,398 --> 00:02:20,698
Not this. It's too big.

57
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:22,534
Holy smokes. What is that?

58
00:02:22,568 --> 00:02:26,337
Couldn't tell you.
Belongs to a Brian Zvonecek.

59
00:02:26,372 --> 00:02:28,840
Hey, Cruz. Go find Otis, would you?

60
00:02:28,874 --> 00:02:32,076
Hey, Otis! Get out here!

61
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:34,913
What'd Otis do now?

62
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:37,882
Ordered something
all the way from Osaka.

63
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,590
Is this what I think it is?

64
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,025
You tell us.

65
00:02:47,059 --> 00:02:48,893
What is it, Otis?

66
00:02:48,928 --> 00:02:53,064
This, gentlemen, is the future.

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,868
<i>Truck 81, Ambulance 61.
Person injured...</i>

68
00:02:56,902 --> 00:02:59,370
Hey, Cruz, can you drag that in for me?

69
00:02:59,405 --> 00:03:01,806
Real gentle. Thanks, pal.

70
00:03:22,861 --> 00:03:24,095
You guys better hurry.

71
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:25,500
Where's the victim?

72
00:03:25,525 --> 00:03:26,998
Right this way with
an attempted break-in.

73
00:03:27,032 --> 00:03:28,172
Didn't work out for the kid.

74
00:03:28,197 --> 00:03:29,567
Got him real good.

75
00:03:33,105 --> 00:03:34,973
Oh, my God.

76
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,579
81 to Main, you better
send out Rescue Squad.

77
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,479

78
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,758
All right. Stop moving, buddy.

79
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:56,127
The more you move, the worse it gets.

80
00:03:58,831 --> 00:04:01,599
Watch your backs.

81
00:04:06,972 --> 00:04:08,139
Oh!

82
00:04:08,173 --> 00:04:09,707
He's losing a lot of blood,

83
00:04:09,742 --> 00:04:11,042
and the medics can't work on him

84
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:12,210
until we get him out of that mess.

85
00:04:12,244 --> 00:04:13,645
Truck can get him down here,

86
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:15,046
but I want Squad to cut him free.

87
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,948
No, let's leave him where he is.

88
00:04:16,982 --> 00:04:19,617
Cruz, grab a Stokes basket,
a rope, and a pulley.

89
00:04:19,652 --> 00:04:20,785
- Copy that.
- What are you doing?

90
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:22,120
Gonna reposition the aerial.

91
00:04:22,154 --> 00:04:23,655
Make it an overhead anchor point.

92
00:04:23,689 --> 00:04:25,123
We'll take the Stokes basket,

93
00:04:25,157 --> 00:04:26,891
and we'll raise it up to the victim,

94
00:04:26,925 --> 00:04:28,626
secure him in it, and then
we'll extract the wires.

95
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:30,795
- Strand by strand.
- That'll take way too long.

96
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:32,797
I Just want to cut
the whole section free,

97
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:34,899
and bring him down, you can
disentangle him on the ground.

98
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:37,201
Casey, you see where that
wire's digging into his leg?

99
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:38,836
Yeah, that's why I want
to bring him down,

100
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:40,138
so the medics can stop the bleeding.

101
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:41,639
I say we should keep him stable.

102
00:04:41,674 --> 00:04:44,575
Mouch! Get that ladder up!

103
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,878
Mouch, scrub that. Stay where you are.

104
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:48,746
I'm making the call.

105
00:04:48,781 --> 00:04:52,183
We bring the victim down,
and work on the ground.

106
00:04:52,217 --> 00:04:54,152
Stokes basket is ready, Lieutenant.

107
00:04:54,186 --> 00:04:56,187
No, we don't need it.

108
00:04:56,221 --> 00:04:58,056
Captain says we're gonna
bring the victim down

109
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,891
right now, wire and all.

110
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,993
Grab the bolt cutters,
and head up on the roof.

111
00:05:02,027 --> 00:05:03,661
- Copy.
- Herrmann,

112
00:05:03,696 --> 00:05:05,563
let me up on that ladder.

113
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,166
All right.

114
00:05:11,704 --> 00:05:13,171
Tony, let's move this dumpster.

115
00:05:13,205 --> 00:05:15,673
Yeah.

116
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,052
- Ready, Lieutenant?
- Go for it.

117
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,864
- Let me grab the pole.
- Flip it.

118
00:05:47,272 --> 00:05:49,741
- You got it, Kidd?
- Yeah.

119
00:05:59,785 --> 00:06:01,285
Whoa, whoa. Wait.

120
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,223
That's it. Stop.

121
00:06:05,257 --> 00:06:06,891
Hey, watch the barbs.

122
00:06:06,925 --> 00:06:08,159
Wire's under a lot of tension.

123
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:09,927
Got it.

124
00:06:13,866 --> 00:06:15,299
Watch it.

125
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:18,169
Okay. Bring him down.

126
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:21,339
Pulley.

127
00:06:21,373 --> 00:06:23,741
- Okay?
- Got it.

128
00:06:25,377 --> 00:06:27,812
Got it.

129
00:06:29,381 --> 00:06:31,816
Damn it.

130
00:06:36,388 --> 00:06:38,289
We got a bleeder.

131
00:06:38,323 --> 00:06:40,091
Femoral artery.
We need to transport now.

132
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,093
Let's go.

133
00:06:44,296 --> 00:06:48,099
Nice work.

134
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,811
Did things seem a little
hostile back there

135
00:06:59,845 --> 00:07:01,612
between Casey and Severide?

136
00:07:01,647 --> 00:07:03,114
Yeah, Squad always thinks

137
00:07:03,148 --> 00:07:04,816
they know better than everyone else.

138
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,317
Okay, thank you, bye.

139
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:08,052
- Hey, Stella.
- Hi.

140
00:07:08,086 --> 00:07:09,954
That was payroll, and
according to their system

141
00:07:09,988 --> 00:07:11,022
they did issue a check for you,

142
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,824
but it wasn't in the packet,

143
00:07:12,858 --> 00:07:15,193
so they must have messed up
somewhere along the line.

144
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:18,129
- Someone did, yeah.
- Oh, mistakes happen.

145
00:07:18,163 --> 00:07:20,665
I will figure
all of this out, I promise.

146
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,633
Maybe it was in another packet.

147
00:07:22,668 --> 00:07:24,969
I will get your check to you ASAP.

148
00:07:25,003 --> 00:07:27,004
Yeah.

149
00:07:28,207 --> 00:07:30,174
Of course it has to be

150
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:31,976
Stella's check that goes missing.

151
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,311
She already hates me.

152
00:07:33,345 --> 00:07:34,979
This is only gonna make it worse.

153
00:07:35,013 --> 00:07:36,414
- She doesn't hate you.
- Oh, please.

154
00:07:36,448 --> 00:07:40,184
I can tell, even if I have no idea why.

155
00:07:42,187 --> 00:07:44,989
No way.

156
00:07:45,023 --> 00:07:47,859
Oh, yeah.

157
00:07:47,893 --> 00:07:50,328
I had my mom send a bunch
of stuff from Fowlerton.

158
00:07:50,362 --> 00:07:51,329
This was in the box.

159
00:07:51,363 --> 00:07:53,264
Oh, my God.

160
00:07:53,298 --> 00:07:55,733
Aww.

161
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,168
Look at what dorks we were.

162
00:07:57,202 --> 00:07:59,871
Oh, yeah, you were never a dork.

163
00:07:59,905 --> 00:08:03,007
Oh, that's the year I got braces.

164
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:06,110
- You were such a good girl.
- Mm, you weren't.

165
00:08:06,144 --> 00:08:08,980
Well...

166
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:14,952
Herrmann, have you seen Severide?

167
00:08:14,987 --> 00:08:17,021
Nah, but come here, Otis
wants to show us something.

168
00:08:20,092 --> 00:08:21,926
What's in the crate?

169
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,363
- Ah.
- Otis says it's the future.

170
00:08:25,397 --> 00:08:28,900
Hey, Kidd, come on in.
You're gonna want to see this.

171
00:08:28,934 --> 00:08:32,203
Okay, so, a few months back,
I signed up with a manufacturer

172
00:08:32,237 --> 00:08:34,205
to beta test a new piece of equipment.

173
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:36,440
And you didn't run it by me first?

174
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:39,477
No, but I'm personally
liable for the loaner unit,

175
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:41,312
so I figured I didn't
need your authorization.

176
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:43,047
You did.

177
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:44,415
Oh, okay. I understand that now,

178
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:46,717
but Casey, you're gonna love this.

179
00:08:46,752 --> 00:08:51,422
Because we're not talking about
some new tool or piece of gear.

180
00:08:51,456 --> 00:08:56,260
This is a whole new class
of firefighting technology.

181
00:08:56,295 --> 00:08:57,495
Otis, open the box.

182
00:08:57,529 --> 00:08:59,764
Tony?

183
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,008
Ta-da.

184
00:09:13,045 --> 00:09:16,280
This is the Kyujo Nakama 250.

185
00:09:16,315 --> 00:09:17,982
Did you call it Cujo?

186
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:22,153
No, I didn't. This is the Kyujo Nakama.

187
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,523
Which means "The Rescue Pal."

188
00:09:27,392 --> 00:09:29,260
Okay.

189
00:09:32,998 --> 00:09:35,032
With all the new responsibilities

190
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:37,435
that Casey's got, you're just
gonna drop that in his lap too?

191
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:39,270
He's gonna thank me for this, okay?

192
00:09:39,304 --> 00:09:42,206
This machine is gonna change everything.

193
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,308
Sure, by putting us out of a job.

194
00:09:44,343 --> 00:09:46,944
Yeah, machines are taking
over fast enough

195
00:09:46,979 --> 00:09:48,479
without traitors like you, you know,

196
00:09:48,513 --> 00:09:51,382
rolling out the red carpet for 'em.

197
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:00,191
Hey. Victim's gonna pull through.

198
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,860
Never lost consciousness
the whole way to the hospital.

199
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,495
Thought you'd want to know.

200
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,597
That's great.

201
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,867
Everything okay?

202
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:14,972
- Casey...
- Yeah.

203
00:10:15,007 --> 00:10:18,476
When you escalate a call...
a routine call...

204
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,012
and bring in Squad, that generally means

205
00:10:21,046 --> 00:10:24,048
the Squad officer is now
in charge of the scene.

206
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,417
Generally, yes. But in this case...

207
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:28,486
So what's the point of
asking me for my expertise

208
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,988
if you're just gonna pull rank
and make me do things your way?

209
00:10:31,023 --> 00:10:34,191
Whoa, I... I didn't pull rank...

210
00:10:34,226 --> 00:10:36,193
I've worked under a lot
of chiefs and officers,

211
00:10:36,228 --> 00:10:39,830
and I've never seen a good
leader ignore an expert opinion

212
00:10:39,865 --> 00:10:41,332
just because he could.

213
00:10:41,366 --> 00:10:43,034
Severide, I wasn't
looking for an assessment

214
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:44,435
of my leadership abilities.

215
00:10:44,469 --> 00:10:46,871
I just came to tell you
about the victim.

216
00:10:48,907 --> 00:10:50,374
Fair enough.

217
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:52,524
Thanks for the update.

218
00:11:07,853 --> 00:11:09,353
We have a problem.

219
00:11:09,933 --> 00:11:12,080
- What is it?
- Nothing life or death,

220
00:11:12,135 --> 00:11:15,331
just I had a little friction
with Severide

221
00:11:15,371 --> 00:11:16,859
on our last call.

222
00:11:16,892 --> 00:11:19,494
I'll spare you the details.
Suffice it to say,

223
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:21,729
he didn't want to follow my command.

224
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,731
Now I get it. He had his opinion

225
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,700
about the rescue, as he should,

226
00:11:25,734 --> 00:11:27,335
but he put me in a position

227
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:28,903
where I had to issue a direct order.

228
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,706
And now he's all bent out of shape.

229
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,343
You need to talk to him, Chief.

230
00:11:35,377 --> 00:11:37,512
- Me?
- Yeah, I already tried,

231
00:11:37,546 --> 00:11:39,781
but you know, we were friends, and...

232
00:11:41,584 --> 00:11:44,285
I think it's hard for him
to accept the new dynamic.

233
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,921
I thought you said
"we" had a problem, Captain.

234
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,923
Well, it's my problem, Chief, but...

235
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,558
Then you should deal with it.

236
00:11:50,593 --> 00:11:51,926
Otherwise, you make it my problem,

237
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,029
and you might not like my solution.

238
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,601
I can't have discord
in my command structure.

239
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,711
That's a untenable situation.

240
00:12:14,751 --> 00:12:17,620
Stokes basket was a good idea.

241
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,354
Yeah, I thought so.

242
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:22,257
Why did Casey have to
overrule you on that?

243
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,393
Couldn't tell you.

244
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:28,563
I mean, you know I love Casey.

245
00:12:28,597 --> 00:12:31,633
But he ought to have more
respect for Rescue Squad.

246
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,069
All our know-how.
The extra training we do.

247
00:12:34,103 --> 00:12:35,236
You gonna finish that compartment

248
00:12:35,271 --> 00:12:37,338
anytime today, Cruz?

249
00:12:43,112 --> 00:12:44,746
Meaning what?

250
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,682
Maybe she took it.

251
00:12:49,585 --> 00:12:51,820
I mean, she got in trouble
for stealing at her old job.

252
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,089
She did not.

253
00:12:54,123 --> 00:12:56,624
Whoops.

254
00:12:56,659 --> 00:12:58,560
Look, if you're talking about Hope,

255
00:12:58,594 --> 00:13:00,395
she would never do that.

256
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:01,763
You know that thing in Fowlerton

257
00:13:01,797 --> 00:13:03,465
was just her crazy boss making stuff up.

258
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:04,833
I know that's what she says.

259
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,568
Hope can't steal your check.

260
00:13:06,602 --> 00:13:07,836
Accounting already
stopped payment on it.

261
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,437
I don't know what she's up to.

262
00:13:09,472 --> 00:13:11,139
The whole thing is weird.

263
00:13:11,173 --> 00:13:13,441
I have never had an issue
with payroll ever.

264
00:13:13,476 --> 00:13:14,609
Have you guys?

265
00:13:14,643 --> 00:13:16,177
No.

266
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,812
No, but that's...

267
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:20,348
Seems to me that
she is either messing with me,

268
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,150
or she's incompetent.

269
00:13:22,184 --> 00:13:23,685
And neither one
of those things are good.

270
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,754
Or accounting made a mistake.

271
00:13:25,788 --> 00:13:28,757
And she's bending over
backwards trying to help you.

272
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,192
It's funny that your problems
with Hope started

273
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,695
right after she slept with Severide.

274
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,301
My...

275
00:13:40,336 --> 00:13:43,371
my problem is that money is tight.

276
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,273
And I'm gonna miss a car payment

277
00:13:45,307 --> 00:13:46,441
because of her screw-up!

278
00:13:46,475 --> 00:13:48,543
Guys, come on.

279
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,179
Oh, good. You're here.

280
00:13:51,213 --> 00:13:53,381
I just talked to Yvonne in payroll,

281
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,316
and they're gonna cut you a new check,

282
00:13:55,351 --> 00:13:57,318
but they say it's gonna take
like two weeks to process.

283
00:13:57,353 --> 00:13:59,287
I told them they had
to do better than that,

284
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:02,457
and I will make sure that they do.

285
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:05,660
I just wanted to keep you updated.

286
00:14:05,694 --> 00:14:09,297
Good.

287
00:14:09,331 --> 00:14:12,667
Thanks, Hope.

288
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:14,769
No problem.

289
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:18,807
Unbelievable.

290
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:24,646
Don't put Brett in the middle of this.

291
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,882
Brett did that. Not me.

292
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:31,553
I'm not the bad guy here.

293
00:14:38,594 --> 00:14:40,862
Are we sure this is a good idea?

294
00:14:40,896 --> 00:14:42,530
It's fine.

295
00:14:42,565 --> 00:14:45,366
The Rescue Pal is on duty.

296
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:56,411
Firehouse burns down. Film at 11:00.

297
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:58,880
Otis!

298
00:14:58,914 --> 00:15:00,381
I got it, I got it.

299
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,683
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

300
00:15:01,717 --> 00:15:04,485
And the robot rebellion has begun.

301
00:15:07,923 --> 00:15:10,592
Oh... okay. Okay.

302
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:11,626
Go.

303
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:16,931
Not a problem. Not a problem.

304
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:19,300
Not a problem. I got this.

305
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,869
Yeah.

306
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:22,403
Okay.

307
00:15:32,815 --> 00:15:35,583
<i>Ambulance 61. Person in Distress.</i>

308
00:15:35,618 --> 00:15:38,286
<i>Halsted and West Washington.</i>

309
00:15:40,456 --> 00:15:43,391
Looks like a good time
to get out of here.

310
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,906
She's over here. Let me show you.

311
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,775
Excuse me.

312
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:03,411
I brought her a chair because
she wasn't feeling good.

313
00:16:03,445 --> 00:16:05,313
Okay. Thank you.

314
00:16:09,518 --> 00:16:12,020
Her pulse is tacky. About 110.

315
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,922
She was in the aisle
complaining of lightheadedness

316
00:16:13,956 --> 00:16:16,624
when I found her.
She's about eight months along.

317
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:18,092
I'm a doctor.

318
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:20,361
Oh, great. We got it from here.

319
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,497
- Thank you.
- Okay, I'm Pete Calhoun.

320
00:16:22,531 --> 00:16:23,498
Let me know if you need anything.

321
00:16:23,532 --> 00:16:24,832
Thanks.

322
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:25,967
Hi, I'm Gabby. What's your name?

323
00:16:26,001 --> 00:16:27,802
I'm Deborah.

324
00:16:27,836 --> 00:16:30,672
I'm fine, really.
I'm just a little bit dizzy.

325
00:16:30,706 --> 00:16:33,374
Check her blood pressure?

326
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,976
Lucky we got a doctor here.

327
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,645
Did the dizziness come on
suddenly, or...?

328
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:43,484
I guess, I... yeah, I think.

329
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,453
Deborah, do you know where you are?

330
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:48,389
I... I...

331
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,891
Deborah?

332
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,893
- Oh, her blood pressure's
really high: 190/108.

333
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,495
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

334
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,444
She's eclamptic.

335
00:17:01,476 --> 00:17:02,475
We need to stop her seizures

336
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,096
and get her to Med fast.
She needs to deliver.

337
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:05,522
Careful. No stimulation.

338
00:17:05,547 --> 00:17:07,554
You need to administer magnesium
sulfate for the seizures.

339
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,648
Yeah, they took that off
our rigs a long time ago.

340
00:17:09,673 --> 00:17:11,640
All right.

341
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:29,866
Pushing two milligrams of Versed.

342
00:17:29,971 --> 00:17:33,307
- I can help hold her.
- Sir, we need you to back off.

343
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:42,837
Pushing two more milligrams.

344
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:54,940
Okay, let's get her out of here.

345
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,641
Yep.

346
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,615
Get her on a cardiac monitor.

347
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,751
We know.

348
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:09,454
Thanks for your help.

349
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:12,791
Yeah, of course. I hope she's okay.

350
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,970
Hey, Cruz. Severide come in yet?

351
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:26,872
Yeah, he took off right
from the apparatus floor.

352
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:29,141
He didn't even change?

353
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:43,555
Hey.

354
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,590
You get an update
on your pregnant victim?

355
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,527
Yeah, yeah, they did
a C-section at the hospital,

356
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:49,995
and both the mom and baby are stable.

357
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,496
Nice going.

358
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,902
You, uh... where's Brett?
Did she cut out early?

359
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:58,937
Yeah. She was vague about why.

360
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,572
I think something's going on.

361
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,441
Or she wanted to avoid
walking out with me.

362
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,076
There must be some way
to expedite that check.

363
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,545
Let me talk to your supervisor.

364
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:08,847
Hey.

365
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,516
If and when
Hope actually gets me my check,

366
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:13,185
I will apologize to Brett.

367
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:16,955
But she should apologize
for that Severide comment.

368
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,725
Mm, I was kind of proud
of her for that one.

369
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,594
Yeah, me too.

370
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:25,497
Herrmann, did you see this?

371
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,104
What the hell's going on?

372
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:33,772
I got to lock up the robot.

373
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,740
I can't risk the other
shifts mishandling it.

374
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,776
So you're putting it in our food locker?

375
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,478
You got a better idea?

376
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,046
Yeah, don't put it in our food locker.

377
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,914
You can't leave this stuff out, Otis.

378
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:45,117
Those guys on third shift
are like raccoons.

379
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:47,085
They'll eat all our Dum-Dums.

380
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,155
Guys, this machine cost 9 million Yuan.

381
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,858
And I'm the one
that's responsible for it.

382
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,463
Hey, Captain, Otis is trying
to turn our food locker

383
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:01,266
into a doggie crate
for his stupid robot.

384
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,268
Figure it out.

385
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,815
There. I figured it out.

386
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,802
Sorry I'm late.

387
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:40,672
Oh, I'm just glad that you showed up.

388
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:42,207
Um... okay.

389
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,110
I was worried that the stalker-ish way

390
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:46,978
I tracked down your number at the CFD

391
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:48,046
might've sent you running.

392
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,848
Oh, it still might.

393
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:52,517
I just figured I'd get
a nice meal out of you first.

394
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:54,686
Ah, smart woman.

395
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:59,024
You were really impressive

396
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:00,625
treating that victim on scene.

397
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,995
Oh, thanks.

398
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,131
- So how long have you...
- What kind of doctor...

399
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,037
How about I order us some wine?

400
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:14,039
Smart man.

401
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:22,814
Thanks.

402
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,752
Here's the thing.

403
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,655
You and I have been working
together a long time.

404
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,891
And developed a certain dynamic.

405
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:34,759
But just because
the dynamic has changed...

406
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,995
My plan was better.

407
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,230
Can I just finish?

408
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:40,098
I know the kid was bleeding out.

409
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,900
The Stokes basket, it wouldn't
have taken that much longer,

410
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:43,735
and we could've kept him stable.

411
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,604
Here's a similar rescue.

412
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,273
Utility worker gets his arm
snagged up on a telephone pole.

413
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,874
That's where I got my idea.

414
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:51,743
Severide, are we talking about

415
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,612
the best way to handle a call,
or are you just miffed

416
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:56,615
because I got my captain's
bugles before you?

417
00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:00,885
The victim's gonna lose his leg.

418
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,120
What?

419
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,688
I talked to Maggie over at Med.

420
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:04,889
The femoral artery, it's ruined.

421
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:06,591
The nerve damage is too great.

422
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:08,960
They're gonna amputate
first thing in the morning.

423
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,930
And your plan could've saved his leg?

424
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:14,766
- You know that for a fact?
- Casey, it was a better plan.

425
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,935
You have no idea if it
would've made a difference.

426
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:19,904
Come on. Nobody can know that.

427
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:21,873
Okay.

428
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,276
Should've kept him stable.

429
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:49,100
I'm not really a kissing-on-
the-first-date kind of girl.

430
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:53,672
Oh, okay. I respect that.

431
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,307
But the thing at the ambulance

432
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:59,844
when you smiled at me,
that was kind of a first date.

433
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,413
Oh, so this would be
like our second date.

434
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:03,782
- Right.
- Oh, I respect that even more.

435
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:07,152
You're very respectful.

436
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:10,255
Which is a good reason
for you to invite me

437
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:11,956
up to your apartment.

438
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:17,829
I have two roommates
who are man-children.

439
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:20,031
I can handle that.

440
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,374
That's the hospital. One second.

441
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:35,447
Hey...

442
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:38,450
Okay, yeah, yeah. Be right there.

443
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:41,019
I am so sorry.
This is a patient emergency.

444
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:42,320
I have to go deal with this.

445
00:23:42,355 --> 00:23:43,888
Oh.

446
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,357
But I had a really good time tonight.

447
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:48,193
Can we do this again soon?
Like imminently?

448
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:52,997
I'd like that.

449
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:54,199
Okay. Bye.

450
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:57,135
Bye.

451
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:11,216
New IPA from Printer's Row.

452
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:16,988
And the Blackhawks game is on.

453
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,058
You just solved all our problems.

454
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:22,460
Mm.

455
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:30,168
I got into this thing
with Brett at work today, and...

456
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:31,503
Mm.

457
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:32,837
What?

458
00:24:32,872 --> 00:24:35,407
How about no firehouse talk?

459
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:37,242
Yeah, I like it.

460
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:40,078
You gotta keep work and
personal life separate.

461
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:42,280
It's the only way to go.

462
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,249
It's the only way.

463
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:57,095
So what happens if
I don't pay rent this month?

464
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:07,272
You keep plying me with beer and hockey,

465
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:10,442
you can stay as long as you want.

466
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:19,150
You're a good friend.

467
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:29,594
All those years I supervised
200 men in that office,

468
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:33,131
and now I'm answering
to a kid half my age.

469
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:35,133
I gotta tell you the truth, baby.

470
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:36,601
I couldn't be happier.

471
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,470
Aww, I'm glad the job's working out.

472
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:40,138
Ah. Enough about the office.

473
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:42,907
Now how you doing?
Things are going well, huh?

474
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:45,009
And Matt, first with that medal,

475
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,445
and now with the promotion, it's like...

476
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,815
Things are good.
I mean this captain thing is...

477
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,317
It's been an adjustment,

478
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:54,419
but, you know,
I think it's good for him.

479
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:57,322
There he is now. Senor Capitan.

480
00:25:57,356 --> 00:25:58,857
Hey, baby.

481
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,992
- Ramon.
- You find Severide?

482
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,927
I found him.

483
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:07,632
He thought I needed a lecture
on how to be a firefighter.

484
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:11,169
Guy's got a serious chip on
his shoulder about my new rank.

485
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:13,505
Well, you know how he's not
afraid to buck authority.

486
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,006
And now you're the authority.

487
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,975
Oh. Great. And if he keeps it up,

488
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:19,344
Boden decides
the situation is untenable,

489
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:20,845
maybe one of us has to go.

490
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,948
Is it untenable?

491
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:25,950
It seems like Severide
just had a strong opinion

492
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:27,051
about the rescue.

493
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,487
Yeah, so did I.

494
00:26:29,522 --> 00:26:31,389
- What, you think he was right?
- No.

495
00:26:31,432 --> 00:26:34,535
Matthew, I don't think that's
what she's saying at all.

496
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,494
Oh, here we go.

497
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:38,162
- I just think that maybe...
- Here's the thing, Ramon.

498
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:39,664
For months we had to listen
to what you think.

499
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:43,268
- We're over it.
- Matt!

500
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:51,409
Uh... this was obviously
the wrong time for a visit.

501
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,511
- Dad.
- No, that's okay, Gabby.

502
00:26:53,546 --> 00:26:56,214
I'll call in the morning, baby.

503
00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:01,886
What is wrong with you?
He's not the enemy, Matt.

504
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:03,555
And neither am I!

505
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:06,391
So everyone else is right,
and I'm wrong.

506
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,364
Got it.

507
00:27:16,405 --> 00:27:17,772
And I didn't say anything to you

508
00:27:17,835 --> 00:27:19,169
since I know how you feel about doctors,

509
00:27:19,203 --> 00:27:21,516
but it was actually a lot of fun.

510
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:25,765
He's really sweet, and funny, and smart.

511
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,779
He's already called and texted
a bunch of times, which I love.

512
00:27:28,804 --> 00:27:32,040
We're getting together again next week.

513
00:27:33,835 --> 00:27:35,811
Are you mad at me?
I should've told you...

514
00:27:35,836 --> 00:27:36,951
No, no, not at all.

515
00:27:36,976 --> 00:27:39,880
It's just, Casey and I really
went at it last night.

516
00:27:39,915 --> 00:27:41,326
Oh, I'm sorry.

517
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,638
I think this whole captain
thing has him stressed out.

518
00:27:43,672 --> 00:27:45,440
Well, it's a lot of responsibility.

519
00:27:45,474 --> 00:27:47,574
Maybe he just needs
some time to adjust to it.

520
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:49,744
I hope so.

521
00:27:50,154 --> 00:27:51,955
Oh, my God!

522
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,115
No! No!

523
00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:55,416
What's the matter, Otis?

524
00:27:55,451 --> 00:27:57,806
Somebody tampered with the robot.

525
00:27:58,353 --> 00:28:01,122
They vandalized it!

526
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:04,375
Are those lollipops?

527
00:28:04,408 --> 00:28:06,543
Unbelievable!

528
00:28:06,577 --> 00:28:09,946
How did they even do this
from outside the cage?

529
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,616
Maybe they reached in with
like a pipe pole or something.

530
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:15,719
Like building a ship in a bottle.

531
00:28:15,753 --> 00:28:17,854
You almost have to admire
their persistence.

532
00:28:17,888 --> 00:28:19,889
Unless...

533
00:28:19,924 --> 00:28:21,891
they knew the combination.

534
00:28:21,926 --> 00:28:25,562
Otis, if I wanted to mess
with your little robot friend,

535
00:28:25,596 --> 00:28:27,564
I'd just take a Halligan to it.

536
00:28:31,635 --> 00:28:34,104
Oh.

537
00:28:34,138 --> 00:28:35,372
Ugh.

538
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,913
Excuse me, Chief.

539
00:28:43,948 --> 00:28:45,048
Yeah?

540
00:28:45,082 --> 00:28:46,816
I'm sorry to bother you,

541
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:49,919
but is it all right if
I take off for an hour?

542
00:28:49,954 --> 00:28:51,321
In the middle of a shift?

543
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:53,123
Yes. I...

544
00:28:53,157 --> 00:28:55,392
The thing is, accounting
won't return my calls,

545
00:28:55,426 --> 00:28:57,093
because I've sort of been harassing them

546
00:28:57,128 --> 00:28:59,629
about Kidd's missing checks,
so I was just gonna show up

547
00:28:59,663 --> 00:29:01,464
and stand there until
they cut her a new one.

548
00:29:01,499 --> 00:29:02,599
Huh.

549
00:29:02,633 --> 00:29:04,501
If that's okay with you.

550
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:08,438
I do appreciate
a healthy dose of tenacity.

551
00:29:08,472 --> 00:29:10,006
You got an hour. Get it done.

552
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,076
Will do. Thank you, Chief, very much.

553
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,478
You're welcome.

554
00:29:18,182 --> 00:29:20,583
Three more seconds.

555
00:29:20,618 --> 00:29:22,685
And... time.

556
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,822
Line them up according to length.

557
00:29:30,161 --> 00:29:32,662
Who's up next?

558
00:29:32,696 --> 00:29:33,963
Where's Otis?

559
00:29:33,997 --> 00:29:36,832
On a phone call last I saw.

560
00:29:36,866 --> 00:29:39,134
Otis, I hope that was an emergency,

561
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,037
because we're drilling out here.

562
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:42,939
Yeah, it was very important.
I did a little sleuthing,

563
00:29:42,973 --> 00:29:45,708
and I'm 98% sure that
it was Boswell on third shift.

564
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:47,143
What was Boswell?

565
00:29:47,178 --> 00:29:50,447
He's the one who vandalized Kyujo.

566
00:29:51,982 --> 00:29:54,884
Otis, pick up the jump rope.

567
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:57,720
Captain, he got lollipop
juice on the motherboard.

568
00:29:57,755 --> 00:29:59,389
It could've shorted out.

569
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,458
You oversee all three watches.

570
00:30:01,492 --> 00:30:02,826
You gotta do something about this.

571
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,627
Done!

572
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,565
Here's what I'm gonna do.

573
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,567
Put that thing back in the crate,

574
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:13,837
and ship it back to China or
wherever the hell it came from.

575
00:30:13,871 --> 00:30:15,638
- What?
- Now, Otis!

576
00:30:15,673 --> 00:30:18,975
Get it done.

577
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:21,044
Yes, Captain.

578
00:30:24,215 --> 00:30:26,115
Again.

579
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:38,094
Hey, Casey. You okay?

580
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:40,897
All right, look. Otis...

581
00:30:40,931 --> 00:30:43,533
well, he's an idiot.

582
00:30:43,567 --> 00:30:46,536
But the robot thing, I mean, could be

583
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,938
he just wants to make
himself useful, you know?

584
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:51,541
He is useful. He's a firefighter.

585
00:30:51,575 --> 00:30:54,744
Yeah, but think about it.

586
00:30:54,778 --> 00:30:58,081
I mean, he's been low man
on the truck for a long time.

587
00:30:58,115 --> 00:31:00,683
You know, maybe he's just looking

588
00:31:00,718 --> 00:31:02,852
for more responsibility.

589
00:31:02,887 --> 00:31:05,855
Tell him it's overrated.

590
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:13,129
It's funny, we never come
to Lakeshore anymore.

591
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:15,598
Yeah, I wanted to pick up supplies here

592
00:31:15,633 --> 00:31:19,269
'cause I noticed Med's been
running low on... gauze lately.

593
00:31:19,303 --> 00:31:21,938
Huh. I didn't notice that.

594
00:31:21,972 --> 00:31:23,740
Excuse me.

595
00:31:23,774 --> 00:31:25,742
Do you know if Dr. Pete Calhoun
is working today?

596
00:31:25,776 --> 00:31:28,077
Yeah, sure, I'll page him.

597
00:31:28,112 --> 00:31:30,146
Thanks.

598
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,981
Dr. Calhoun, come to the front desk.

599
00:31:32,016 --> 00:31:33,550
Why didn't you just say
you wanted to swing by

600
00:31:33,584 --> 00:31:34,784
and see Dr. Hottie?

601
00:31:34,818 --> 00:31:36,119
I wasn't sure if you'd want to.

602
00:31:36,153 --> 00:31:37,820
And there really wasn't much gauze

603
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:39,255
at Med last time we were there, so...

604
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,157
Mm-hmm. Oh.

605
00:31:45,629 --> 00:31:49,132
Sylvie, what are you doing here?

606
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:51,234
We were just picking up supplies,

607
00:31:51,268 --> 00:31:52,769
so I figured I'd say hi.

608
00:31:52,803 --> 00:31:54,837
Dr. Calhoun, it's your wife.

609
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:56,606
She says there's no parking spaces,

610
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,842
so she's waiting out front for you.

611
00:31:59,877 --> 00:32:01,177
Your wife?

612
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:03,513
I'll call you later and explain, okay?

613
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:05,081
No. Not okay.

614
00:32:05,115 --> 00:32:06,916
- Sylvie...
- What is wrong with you?

615
00:32:06,951 --> 00:32:09,319
Hey, come on, let's get
the hell out of here.

616
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:16,259
How could I be so wrong about that guy?

617
00:32:16,293 --> 00:32:19,128
Ugh, I'm sorry. He's a fool.

618
00:32:19,163 --> 00:32:23,933
It never even occurred to me
that he might be married.

619
00:32:23,968 --> 00:32:25,635
I'm the fool.

620
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:28,037
No. Hey, no, you are not.

621
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:29,973
You just tend to see the best in people,

622
00:32:30,007 --> 00:32:31,708
and maybe...

623
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:35,044
sometimes ignore the rest.

624
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:38,114
It's something all your friends
know and love about you.

625
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:46,556
What?

626
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,892
Nothing.

627
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:52,328
Let's just go.

628
00:33:06,953 --> 00:33:08,803
Stella.

629
00:33:17,712 --> 00:33:18,946
How did...

630
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,217
I stood in front of Yvonne's desk

631
00:33:20,242 --> 00:33:21,676
whining until she got so sick of me

632
00:33:21,701 --> 00:33:23,684
that she wrote it out by hand.

633
00:33:23,718 --> 00:33:25,719
I'm an impressive whiner.

634
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:28,011
I guess you are.

635
00:33:29,057 --> 00:33:30,357
Thanks, Hope.

636
00:33:30,391 --> 00:33:32,176
No problem.

637
00:33:33,528 --> 00:33:36,220
Gotta hand it to your friend.

638
00:33:36,596 --> 00:33:38,541
She pulled it off.

639
00:33:38,865 --> 00:33:40,861
I'm glad it worked out.

640
00:33:45,805 --> 00:33:47,873
Wasn't my best apology.

641
00:33:47,907 --> 00:33:51,310
Pretty sure that's not
what's bothering her.

642
00:33:56,249 --> 00:33:58,450
If you two are here to gloat,
take it somewhere else.

643
00:33:58,484 --> 00:33:59,852
We're not here to gloat.

644
00:33:59,886 --> 00:34:00,953
We're here to deliver great news.

645
00:34:00,987 --> 00:34:03,956
Okay. What?

646
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:07,192
We told Casey he ought to
give the robot a second chance.

647
00:34:07,227 --> 00:34:09,628
He said you could keep it.

648
00:34:09,662 --> 00:34:11,396
Seriously?

649
00:34:11,431 --> 00:34:14,299
Yes, with the caveat
that you can't send it

650
00:34:14,334 --> 00:34:15,901
into a working fire.

651
00:34:15,935 --> 00:34:17,936
Well if I can't deploy it
in an actual fire,

652
00:34:17,971 --> 00:34:19,571
then what use is it?

653
00:34:19,606 --> 00:34:22,941
I could think of plenty
of uses for this.

654
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:33,418
Oh, hey!

655
00:34:35,421 --> 00:34:37,556
So, I get to keep my robot,

656
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,291
and you get to keep disrespecting it?

657
00:34:39,325 --> 00:34:41,260
Yeah. It's your devil's bargain.

658
00:34:41,294 --> 00:34:44,429
Besides, you're better at driving this

659
00:34:44,464 --> 00:34:47,733
than you are at driving that.

660
00:34:47,767 --> 00:34:49,635
You think I'm a good driver?

661
00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:51,570
Sure.

662
00:34:53,773 --> 00:34:56,575
Everybody does.

663
00:35:10,456 --> 00:35:12,758
Hey, guys.

664
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:15,427
Can I have a minute
with your lieutenant?

665
00:35:15,461 --> 00:35:17,362
Uh... yeah. Sure thing, Casey.

666
00:35:17,397 --> 00:35:18,830
No worries.

667
00:35:26,005 --> 00:35:29,775
Here's your article.

668
00:35:29,809 --> 00:35:31,643
I see what you're talking about.

669
00:35:31,678 --> 00:35:34,746
It made a lot of sense
to try it that way.

670
00:35:37,884 --> 00:35:40,953
You really think
it would've saved his leg?

671
00:35:42,488 --> 00:35:46,458
The damage was done
long before we got there.

672
00:35:48,661 --> 00:35:51,063
So here's the thing, Severide.

673
00:35:51,097 --> 00:35:52,798
We had a victim bleeding out.

674
00:35:52,832 --> 00:35:55,033
And I had to choose between
the fastest rescue,

675
00:35:55,068 --> 00:35:56,802
and the most cautious one.

676
00:35:56,836 --> 00:35:58,870
I chose speed.

677
00:35:58,905 --> 00:36:02,808
But whatever the outcome,
it's on my shoulders.

678
00:36:02,842 --> 00:36:04,910
I can't have you bucking
the chain of command,

679
00:36:04,944 --> 00:36:07,679
whether or not you think
you know better.

680
00:36:07,714 --> 00:36:10,916
I don't expect you
to be thrilled by my rank.

681
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:14,853
But you need to respect it.

682
00:36:14,887 --> 00:36:17,589
You're right.

683
00:36:17,623 --> 00:36:19,758
100%.

684
00:36:29,802 --> 00:36:33,405
I guess I can't blame him.

685
00:36:33,439 --> 00:36:34,773
Not sure how well I'd take it

686
00:36:34,807 --> 00:36:36,341
if the shoe was on the other foot,

687
00:36:36,376 --> 00:36:38,443
and Severide was telling me what to do.

688
00:36:38,478 --> 00:36:40,078
But you ironed it all out?

689
00:36:40,113 --> 00:36:43,015
The work part of it, at least.

690
00:36:43,049 --> 00:36:45,851
Might be a while before we take
any fishing trips together.

691
00:36:45,885 --> 00:36:48,120
Hm.

692
00:36:48,154 --> 00:36:51,390
How do you find a balance
between being a leader

693
00:36:51,424 --> 00:36:54,760
and being a friend?

694
00:36:54,794 --> 00:36:56,862
You notice I don't have
a lot of friends.

695
00:37:01,501 --> 00:37:04,603
You notice...

696
00:37:04,637 --> 00:37:07,639
I am on my third marriage.

697
00:37:15,581 --> 00:37:19,918
Heavy is the head
that wears the crown, Casey.

698
00:37:19,952 --> 00:37:24,723
The life of a leader is...

699
00:37:24,757 --> 00:37:26,958
it's a minefield.

700
00:37:33,533 --> 00:37:37,002
When you figure out how to
navigate it, you let me know.

701
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,818
Hey.

702
00:37:52,852 --> 00:37:54,686
Leaving without me?

703
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,121
I saw you with Boden.

704
00:37:56,155 --> 00:37:57,656
Figured you had captain stuff
to deal with.

705
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:58,757
Paperwork and all that.

706
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:00,592
Paperwork can wait.

707
00:38:00,626 --> 00:38:02,761
I thought we could grab
some breakfast at Yolk.

708
00:38:02,795 --> 00:38:04,596
- Yolk, huh?
- Yeah, why not?

709
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,498
Maybe even invite your dad.

710
00:38:06,532 --> 00:38:07,833
Ha.

711
00:38:07,867 --> 00:38:11,036
Or maybe just the two of us?

712
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:13,939
Yeah. That's better.

713
00:38:13,973 --> 00:38:17,008
Yeah. It is.

714
00:38:22,648 --> 00:38:24,182
Hey.

715
00:38:24,217 --> 00:38:26,685
Stella seemed pretty happy
about the check, huh?

716
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:29,788
Yeah, that worked out
really well for you.

717
00:38:29,822 --> 00:38:31,790
For me?

718
00:38:31,824 --> 00:38:34,793
Yeah, I mean, you got to save
the day for the one person

719
00:38:34,827 --> 00:38:39,131
that, like you said,
had a problem with you.

720
00:38:39,165 --> 00:38:41,800
I would've done that for anyone.

721
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:44,469
I'm just glad it turned out okay.

722
00:38:44,504 --> 00:38:46,538
Me too.

723
00:38:46,572 --> 00:38:49,508
Because I would really hate
to think that you would mess

724
00:38:49,542 --> 00:38:50,909
with any of my friends here

725
00:38:50,943 --> 00:38:53,145
just to make yourself look better.

726
00:38:53,179 --> 00:38:55,680
Sylvie, of course not.

727
00:38:55,715 --> 00:38:58,016
You know I'm not like that.

728
00:39:01,053 --> 00:39:04,156
I would never do that to you.

729
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:07,159
Or any of the people at 51,
because I love it here.

730
00:39:09,195 --> 00:39:11,263
So do I.

731
00:39:51,594 --> 00:39:56,594

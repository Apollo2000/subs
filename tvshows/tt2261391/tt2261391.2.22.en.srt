Severide, what's your status?

She hasn't called me in weeks.

Maybe I just won't find

to Donna on Saturday ...

Yeah, okay?

And I just heard Father Dan
use the word "impossible"

when I asked him if I could
use the cathedral on Saturday.

Did you ever hear a priest use that word?

Actually, I have.

Hey, Newhouse, I got a question for you.

Shoot.

221
00:11:42,925 --> 00:11:47,161
Well, my dad died when I was little...

222
00:11:47,196 --> 00:11:48,863
in a building fire like this one, actually.

223

I'm sorry to hear that.

224
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:51,399
No, hey, it was a long time ago,

225
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:54,702
but my mom sort of kept me
from that side of the family.

226
00:11:54,737 --> 00:11:56,938
From what she says, they
weren't all too nice to her.

227
00:11:56,972 --> 00:12:01,209
My dad's side, it's always
been this black hole to me.

Look, I do this type of
thing all the time, man.

229

It's more legwork than keystrokes,

You guys see anyone?

345
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:15,720
There were a couple of skaters over there.

346
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:18,590
I think they called it in.

Not exactly.

we found a kid...

I walk into a 7-Eleven,

and I walk right up behind
this kid stealing a candy bar.

He turned around,

and he just froze when he saw me,

and then he reached in
his pocket real slow,

00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:43,786
put it back.

And I got whatever stupid
thing I was getting,

464

and then I heard gunshots.

465
00:26:54,497 --> 00:26:55,531
I ran outside,

466
00:26:55,565 --> 00:26:56,966
and I see two bangers driving away,

467
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,735
and there's the kid.

468

He's just laying dead in the alley.

And I've thought about it a thousand times.

Why didn't I stop him, talk to him,

471
00:27:15,261 --> 00:27:16,895
arrest him even?

472

When I first met Gabriela Dawson,

499
00:28:40,763 --> 00:28:45,067
I thought to myself, "what's
wrong with this chick?"

And now she's a candidate

00:39:40,198 --> 00:39:42,733
Yeah, we are.

677
00:39:42,767 --> 00:39:44,401
Hitting floor two now.

678
00:39:44,436 --> 00:39:46,603
Little more fire here.

679
00:39:46,638 --> 00:39:48,105
Got a victim on the first floor,

680
00:39:48,139 --> 00:39:49,473
fell down some stairs.

681
00:39:49,507 --> 00:39:50,774
Possible spinal injury.

682
00:39:50,809 --> 00:39:51,909
We're on it.

683
00:39:51,943 --> 00:39:53,611
Mouch and Cruz are on the roof,

684
00:39:53,645 --> 00:39:54,978
starting to vent.

685
00:39:55,013 --> 00:39:56,313
Second floor is clear.

686
00:39:56,348 --> 00:39:58,048
[Garbled] Squad's heading to assist.

687
00:39:58,083 --> 00:39:59,383
Say that again, Severide?

688
00:39:59,417 --> 00:40:01,485
[Static]

689
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:04,121
Severide, Rescue Squad, report back.

690
00:40:04,155 --> 00:40:06,991
We can't hear you out here.

691
00:40:07,025 --> 00:40:09,727
[Garbled] Squad's heading...

692
00:40:09,761 --> 00:40:14,164
Could be heavy concrete
affecting the radios.

693
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:17,568
Truck 81, Casey.

694
00:40:17,602 --> 00:40:20,504
What do you see?

695
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:25,943
House 51, anyone, report.

696
00:40:30,882 --> 00:40:34,051
I don't like this, Kenny.

697
00:40:34,085 --> 00:40:35,286
I'll go check it out.

698
00:40:40,923 --> 00:40:43,391
[Garbled] Pull back... it's flammable...

699
00:40:43,425 --> 00:40:44,459
Fire closing in!

700
00:40:44,493 --> 00:40:46,294
Out! Out! Now!

701
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:57,572
[Coughing]

702
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:03,978
Oh, God.

703
00:41:04,012 --> 00:41:06,280
Report!

704
00:41:06,315 --> 00:41:09,283

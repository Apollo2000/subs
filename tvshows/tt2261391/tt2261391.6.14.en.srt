It just so happens that
Julian and I were talking

178
00:07:56,915 --> 00:07:58,782

00:07:58,784 --> 00:08:02,385
why don't we have two salesmen
out in the field?

180

How are we gonna pay for all this?

181

Don't worry about that, Cruz.

183

It's not a liability.

Thank you, Connie.

I understand you're a man down today.

1323

Terrible business.

1324
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:01,200
Yeah, well, all things considered,

1325
01:08:01,203 --> 01:08:02,469

That's good to hear.

Reality being what it is, though,

1328
01:08:05,808 --> 01:08:08,742
we have to think about
the future of Truck 81.

1329
01:08:08,744 --> 01:08:10,677
- In what sense?
- In the sense that we can't

keep a seat on hold indefinitely.

1331
01:08:14,383 --> 01:08:17,184
Look, Firefighter Zvonecek
is undergoing a procedure

1332
01:08:17,186 --> 01:08:18,819
this morning at great personal risk.

1333
01:08:18,821 --> 01:08:20,387
He has every intention of coming...

1334
01:08:20,389 --> 01:08:22,155
We'll see how that goes,
but moving forward,

1335
01:08:22,157 --> 01:08:23,790
we can't have your truck understaffed

1336
01:08:23,792 --> 01:08:26,593
any longer than a shift or two.

1337

Understood.

1338
01:08:29,131 --> 01:08:30,263
I'll send you and your captain

1339
01:08:30,265 --> 01:08:31,798
a list of floaters to consider.

1340
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,533
We'll talk.

1341
01:08:33,535 --> 01:08:35,268
Appreciate it, Chief.

1342
01:08:40,476 --> 01:08:42,242
Okay.

1343
01:08:42,244 --> 01:08:44,711
Before we begin today,

1344
01:08:44,713 --> 01:08:47,547
I have an update from the hospital.

1345
01:08:47,549 --> 01:08:51,151
Otis is headed to surgery as we speak.

1346
01:08:51,153 --> 01:08:52,919
Now, I'll report the news
the moment I have it,

1347
01:08:52,921 --> 01:08:54,189
but in the meantime,

1348
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:56,838
let's just keep him in our prayers.

1349
01:08:57,326 --> 01:09:01,895
I have also been informed
Samantha Haberman,

1350
01:09:01,897 --> 01:09:04,431
the woman who took a bullet
in the fire last shift,

1351
01:09:04,433 --> 01:09:06,733
she has succumbed to her wounds.

1352
01:09:06,735 --> 01:09:08,769
So what does that mean?

1353
01:09:08,771 --> 01:09:10,637
Is her son finally gonna
get arrested for man...

1354
01:09:10,639 --> 01:09:12,439
That's on the CPD
and the state's attorney

1355
01:09:12,441 --> 01:09:13,807
to decide, not us.

1356
01:09:16,678 --> 01:09:20,113
Look, okay, we had
a terrible moment last shift.

1357
01:09:20,115 --> 01:09:22,382
We nearly lost one of our own.

1358
01:09:22,384 --> 01:09:24,851
So for the next few hours,
I want each of us

1359
01:09:24,853 --> 01:09:27,788
to put aside our anger

1360
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:31,258
so we can show this city who we are.

1361
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:34,127
- Of course, Chief.
- Yes, Chief.

1362
01:09:34,129 --> 01:09:36,229
Okay, then.

1363

1473
01:16:18,278 --> 01:16:20,879
Yeah, I'm sure it's...

1474
01:16:27,821 --> 01:16:29,821
Nothing...

1475
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:38,697
- What now?
- Nothing.

1476
01:16:38,699 --> 01:16:41,666
Just cleaning out some
useless junk from my locker.

1477
01:16:41,668 --> 01:16:43,401
For instance, Antonio gave me these

1478
01:16:43,403 --> 01:16:45,170
when we went to Montrose Beach.

1479
01:16:45,172 --> 01:16:46,338
Don't know why I still keep them.

1480
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:47,339
I haven't used them since.

1481
01:16:47,341 --> 01:16:48,640
I have realized something.

1482
01:16:48,642 --> 01:16:50,875
- Let's hear it.
- I need to move forward.

1483
01:16:50,877 --> 01:16:52,611
With a fresh perspective.

1484
01:16:52,613 --> 01:16:55,580
And that includes
this thing with Antonio.

1485
01:16:55,582 --> 01:16:56,881
Okay.

1486
01:16:56,883 --> 01:16:59,384
That sounds different than last night.

1487
01:16:59,386 --> 01:17:00,919
I mean, technically, nothing changed

1488
01:17:00,921 --> 01:17:03,321
about our situation since
before I took the test, right?

1489
01:17:03,323 --> 01:17:04,689
- True.
- Right.

1490
01:17:04,691 --> 01:17:06,591
So why would my feelings
be any different now?

1491
01:17:06,593 --> 01:17:11,563
I wanted to keep things light,
leave my options open, do me.

1492
01:17:11,565 --> 01:17:12,797
I like this new attitude.

1493
01:17:12,799 --> 01:17:15,266
Strong. Steady.

1494
01:17:15,268 --> 01:17:19,437
And who knows, I mean, if...
if down the line,

1495
01:17:19,439 --> 01:17:21,206
Antonio and I are meant
to be together, then...

1496
01:17:21,208 --> 01:17:23,141
Veering off course.

1497
01:17:23,143 --> 01:17:25,610
I think it might be better to
just stick to the first part.

1498
01:17:25,612 --> 01:17:28,780
No. You're right. You're right.

1499
01:17:28,782 --> 01:17:30,482
Fresh start.

1500
01:17:30,484 --> 01:17:33,485
New day, new Brett.

1501
01:17:33,487 --> 01:17:35,587
Amen to that.

1502
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:46,331
Uh, sorry, we're...

1503
01:17:47,401 --> 01:17:49,334
Hey.

1504
01:17:49,336 --> 01:17:52,537
- Hi.
- You stuck here a while?

1505
01:17:52,539 --> 01:17:55,774
Yeah, I was just
about to start inventory.

1506
01:17:55,776 --> 01:17:57,809
- Why?
- I was gonna hit Chi Cafe.

1507
01:17:57,811 --> 01:17:59,611
Thought you might be up for a bite,

1508
01:17:59,613 --> 01:18:02,547
but... another time.

1509
01:18:04,418 --> 01:18:06,551
Well, hold on. Kelly...

1510
01:18:06,553 --> 01:18:10,889
Look, I know that communication
is not your first language,

1511
01:18:10,891 --> 01:18:14,793
but... what's going on with you lately?

1512
01:18:14,795 --> 01:18:17,195
You've been dodging me
and just acting off

1513
01:18:17,197 --> 01:18:19,431
ever since the fire.

1514
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:23,981
Can you just, for once,

1515
01:18:24,237 --> 01:18:27,364
just tell me what you're feeling?

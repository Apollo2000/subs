1
00:00:01,461 --> 00:00:03,828
It's the new drug called "gray."

2
00:00:03,862 --> 00:00:05,630
Two people OD'd on it last week.

3
00:00:05,664 --> 00:00:06,764
You know who's moving it?

4
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:08,566
No. Still working on it.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,134
Sienna, I need something real

6
00:00:10,168 --> 00:00:11,779
or I have to file that
coke possession charge.

7
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,905
I keep telling you it wasn't mine.

8
00:00:13,941 --> 00:00:15,811
- This guy paid me to...
- Yeah, I believe you.

9
00:00:15,836 --> 00:00:17,252
Which is why I gave you
a month to work it off.

10
00:00:17,276 --> 00:00:18,423
So far, nothing.

11
00:00:18,448 --> 00:00:19,769
Now you only have three days left.

12
00:00:19,793 --> 00:00:22,161
Wait, wait, wait,
I've got something else.

13
00:00:22,195 --> 00:00:25,765
My friend, Isabel... she works
at the club with me sometimes.

14
00:00:25,917 --> 00:00:27,818
Anyway, she has this new boyfriend.

15
00:00:27,852 --> 00:00:29,586
He hits her.

16
00:00:29,621 --> 00:00:32,823
That's horrible, but we
don't do domestic abuse cases.

17
00:00:33,348 --> 00:00:36,458
Um, how about murder?

18
00:00:37,419 --> 00:00:38,896
What?

19
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,964
She said her boyfriend killed someone.

20
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,834
An old girlfriend, he beat her to death.

21
00:00:43,868 --> 00:00:46,436
That's why I'm so scared for Isabel.

22
00:00:50,775 --> 00:00:53,410
Did Isabel say anything else... a name?

23
00:00:53,444 --> 00:00:57,481
She just said her boyfriend
dumped the body near a factory.

24
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:00,684
- Wyatt, I think.
- Who's the boyfriend?

25
00:01:00,718 --> 00:01:02,085
She calls him D.

26
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,620
I didn't push for details.

27
00:01:03,655 --> 00:01:05,588
Look, I've got enough drama of my own.

28
00:01:05,613 --> 00:01:07,018
When's the last time you
talked to Isabel?

29
00:01:07,042 --> 00:01:08,792
Three weeks ago.

30
00:01:08,826 --> 00:01:12,829
I've been texting her,
but she's not answering.

31
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:15,032
And I don't know where she lives.

32
00:01:15,172 --> 00:01:17,053
You're using again, I can see it.

33
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:19,060
- No, that's not true, I swear.
- You have three days

34
00:01:19,084 --> 00:01:22,286
to find me something real
or I file those charges.

35
00:01:29,027 --> 00:01:32,096
- She have anything good?
- No.

36
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,232
I mean, some B.S.
about her friend's boyfriend

37
00:01:35,267 --> 00:01:39,136
killing someone, dumping the
body behind the Wyatt factory.

38
00:01:39,171 --> 00:01:40,671
She's just trying to buy more time

39
00:01:40,706 --> 00:01:42,573
because her month's almost up.

40
00:01:42,607 --> 00:01:43,941
She looked pretty upset.

41
00:01:43,975 --> 00:01:47,078
- Yeah, she's a good actor.
- Maybe.

42
00:01:47,112 --> 00:01:49,246
It might still be worth
calling in though.

43
00:01:49,281 --> 00:01:50,281
No.

44
00:01:50,315 --> 00:01:51,749
Does that mean you're not going

45
00:01:51,783 --> 00:01:53,184
to give her any more time?

46
00:01:53,218 --> 00:01:54,762
Well, you're not
supposed to extend deals

47
00:01:54,786 --> 00:01:56,454
according to the book, so.

48
00:01:56,488 --> 00:01:57,922
This is my first C.I.

49
00:01:57,956 --> 00:02:00,257
Yeah, the book's not always right.

50
00:02:00,292 --> 00:02:02,760
Sometimes you got to trust your gut.

51
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:12,937
So Woods bought the money gag.

52
00:02:12,971 --> 00:02:14,472
Thinks I'm on his side again.

53
00:02:14,506 --> 00:02:16,117
- All right, good.
- Okay, so what's next?

54
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:17,942
When do we take him down?

55
00:02:17,976 --> 00:02:19,610
We find his biggest weakness.

56
00:02:19,644 --> 00:02:21,011
Booze, women, gambling.

57
00:02:21,046 --> 00:02:23,614
I've already found it, boss. It's you.

58
00:02:25,517 --> 00:02:27,318
Thanks, Adam.

59
00:02:27,352 --> 00:02:28,986
Yeah.

60
00:02:33,825 --> 00:02:35,626
Still not convinced?

61
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:40,297
No, I believe him.
Doesn't mean I forgive him.

62
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,302
Sarge, you got a minute?

63
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,811
Um...

64
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:53,144
I just wanted to apologize
for what happened with Camilla.

65
00:02:53,178 --> 00:02:55,479
I put the team in a bad situation.

66
00:02:55,514 --> 00:02:58,215
A really bad situation,
and it won't happen again.

67
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,384
You have my word.

68
00:03:00,418 --> 00:03:03,420
Well, you're on desk duty
until further notice,

69
00:03:03,455 --> 00:03:06,557
and you've got an appointment
with the psychologist at 1:00.

70
00:03:11,062 --> 00:03:13,998
- Hey.
- Bless your heart.

71
00:03:14,032 --> 00:03:15,209
Double shot latte, three sugars.

72
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:16,600
Have I told you

73
00:03:16,635 --> 00:03:18,836
you're my favorite member
of Intelligence?

74
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,105
Never.

75
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:23,107
- Hey.
- Hey.

76
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:25,242
- You.
- Thanks.

77
00:03:25,277 --> 00:03:27,678
Hey, so did you
make a decision on Sienna?

78
00:03:27,712 --> 00:03:30,948
Yeah. She doesn't deliver,
I'm going to file the charges.

79
00:03:30,982 --> 00:03:32,550
I gave her a chance and she blew it.

80
00:03:32,584 --> 00:03:34,919
Ooh, nice to see you toughen up.

81
00:03:34,953 --> 00:03:37,188
Don't let anyone take advantage.

82
00:03:37,222 --> 00:03:40,057
Detective Upton.

83
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:43,260
Yeah, I'll be there in 10 minutes.

84
00:03:43,295 --> 00:03:46,030
- We got to go.
- What? Where?

85
00:03:46,064 --> 00:03:48,065
- Homicide.
- Okay.

86
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:52,403
Looks like she was beaten to death.

87
00:03:52,437 --> 00:03:54,371
It's pretty gruesome.

88
00:03:54,406 --> 00:03:56,440
Yeah. Hey, thanks for following up.

89
00:03:56,474 --> 00:03:58,809
- Nice work.
- It cost me 50 bucks.

90
00:03:58,844 --> 00:04:00,277
How's that?

91
00:04:00,312 --> 00:04:02,046
Gave Winters over here tentoone odds

92
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,881
your snitch was talking crap.

93
00:04:03,915 --> 00:04:05,883
Her snitch.

94
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:07,318
Hey, can you do me a favor

95
00:04:07,352 --> 00:04:08,953
and make the appropriate notifications?

96
00:04:08,987 --> 00:04:11,121
- Yeah.
- Thanks, guys.

97
00:04:14,092 --> 00:04:16,393
Like I said, it was just a hunch.

98
00:04:16,428 --> 00:04:19,563
Sienna's story was
a little too weird to be fake.

99
00:04:19,598 --> 00:04:22,433
- I'm sorry if I overstepped.
- You did.

100
00:04:24,035 --> 00:04:25,402
Well, at least now you know

101
00:04:25,437 --> 00:04:27,271
Sienna isn't playing you, right?

102
00:04:33,638 --> 00:04:37,340

103
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:39,093
She's a Jane Doe.

104
00:04:39,143 --> 00:04:40,977
We ran her prints;
They're not in the system.

105
00:04:41,152 --> 00:04:42,663
And my CI doesn't know her name either,

106
00:04:42,687 --> 00:04:44,989
but her friend's name is Isabel Perez.

107
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:46,290
And she's dating the same guy

108
00:04:46,324 --> 00:04:47,925
that looks good for this murder.

109
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:48,999
What do we know about her?

110
00:04:49,027 --> 00:04:50,194
- Isabel?
- Yeah.

111
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:51,929
Latina, 21, used to work

112
00:04:51,963 --> 00:04:53,441
on and off at a strip club
on the west side.

113
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:55,132
A place called Alibi.

114
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:58,035
Okay, so we think her
boyfriend killed the Jane Doe?

115
00:04:58,069 --> 00:04:59,603
Yeah, yeah, and maybe Isabel too.

116
00:04:59,638 --> 00:05:01,338
Because she's been missing three weeks,

117
00:05:01,373 --> 00:05:02,783
I tried tracking her phone. It's dead.

118
00:05:02,807 --> 00:05:04,318
All right, well,
talk to your C.I. again.

119
00:05:04,342 --> 00:05:05,809
See what you can find out.

120
00:05:05,844 --> 00:05:07,978
Meanwhile, let's dig into this Jane Doe.

121
00:05:08,013 --> 00:05:11,215
What's her name? What's her story?

122
00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:12,950
Let me know if you want me to jump in.

123
00:05:12,984 --> 00:05:14,952
No, we're good.

124
00:05:14,986 --> 00:05:16,387
Your appointment's in ten minutes.

125
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:18,689
If I were you, I'd be on time.

126
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,529
I'm Dr. Rebecca Sloan.

127
00:05:25,563 --> 00:05:28,515
Have you ever been in therapy before?

128
00:05:29,265 --> 00:05:32,169
Um, I talked to someone
a while back, yeah.

129
00:05:32,203 --> 00:05:36,000
- After a shooting.
- Right, it's mandatory.

130
00:05:36,582 --> 00:05:41,720
So, so you ask me
questions, and I talk, right?

131
00:05:41,746 --> 00:05:43,347
This is your time.

132
00:05:43,381 --> 00:05:46,183
If you have something
you want to talk about,

133
00:05:46,217 --> 00:05:48,819
I'll listen.

134
00:05:48,853 --> 00:05:51,789
And if I don't?

135
00:05:57,095 --> 00:05:59,496
C.O.D. was blunt force trauma.

136
00:05:59,531 --> 00:06:03,100
She was beaten repeatedly
with a long object,

137
00:06:03,134 --> 00:06:04,501
like a pipe or a tire iron.

138
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:06,170
You can tell by the parallel tracks.

139
00:06:06,204 --> 00:06:07,404
When'd she die?

140
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,040
Based on decomp, about a month ago.

141
00:06:10,075 --> 00:06:11,508
Find any evidence on her body?

142
00:06:11,543 --> 00:06:13,177
I'm running semen samples now.

143
00:06:13,211 --> 00:06:15,245
- Sexual assault?
- Hard to say.

144
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,847
No tearing of tissues.

145
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:18,882
Any offensive or defensive wounds?

146
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:21,285
No, doesn't look like
there was much of a struggle.

147
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:22,686
Probably knew her killer.

148
00:06:22,721 --> 00:06:23,965
That syncs up with the C.I. story,

149
00:06:23,989 --> 00:06:25,422
boyfriend killed girlfriend.

150
00:06:25,457 --> 00:06:27,691
There's one other thing
worth pointing out.

151
00:06:27,726 --> 00:06:30,627
She's had lots of cosmetic procedures.

152
00:06:30,662 --> 00:06:33,697
Injections into
the breasts, buttocks, lips.

153
00:06:33,732 --> 00:06:35,543
All right, we'll get a list
of nearby plastic surgeons.

154
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:37,434
Probably a waste of time.

155
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:40,571
It appears she was injected
with motor oil.

156
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,945
So this guy Isabel is with
really killed somebody?

157
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:49,380
- Damn.
- Looks that way.

158
00:06:49,414 --> 00:06:51,382
We found the body
behind the Wyatt factory,

159
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,583
just like Isabel said.

160
00:06:52,617 --> 00:06:54,651
I'm glad I told you about it.

161
00:06:54,686 --> 00:06:57,388
I wasn't sure, you know, Izzy,
she says a lot of wacky things.

162
00:06:57,422 --> 00:07:00,624
But this was crazy, even for her.

163
00:07:00,658 --> 00:07:02,826
I can't have no felony on my record.

164
00:07:02,861 --> 00:07:05,562
I'll never get a good job
at a restaurant.

165
00:07:05,597 --> 00:07:07,564
I'm training to be a chef.

166
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,500
That's great. So just stay focused.

167
00:07:09,534 --> 00:07:11,502
Do what I need you to do,
and you'll be fine.

168
00:07:11,536 --> 00:07:12,970
Let's start at the beginning, okay?

169
00:07:13,004 --> 00:07:15,739
Where was Isabel living
before she met D?

170
00:07:15,774 --> 00:07:18,609
A shelter. Like a charity thing.

171
00:07:18,643 --> 00:07:21,779
You know, beds, counselors, food.

172
00:07:21,813 --> 00:07:24,915
Izzy was always trying
to get her life right.

173
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:26,583
She just never could.

174
00:07:26,618 --> 00:07:28,485
What's it called?

175
00:07:30,655 --> 00:07:33,290
No, she doesn't look familiar.

176
00:07:33,324 --> 00:07:35,002
But we talk to over
a hundred women a month.

177
00:07:35,026 --> 00:07:36,660
Many of them are timid,

178
00:07:36,694 --> 00:07:39,263
or so scared they won't even
tell us their real names.

179
00:07:39,297 --> 00:07:43,000
But we let them in nonetheless.

180
00:07:43,034 --> 00:07:44,635
What's this about?

181
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:46,670
She was reported missing.

182
00:07:46,704 --> 00:07:48,839
Can we look through some of your files?

183
00:07:48,873 --> 00:07:51,508
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, I can help with that.

184
00:07:51,543 --> 00:07:54,011
Great. Thanks, Juan.

185
00:07:56,915 --> 00:07:59,450
Okay, you're right.

186
00:07:59,484 --> 00:08:01,018
Isabel Perez, here she is.

187
00:08:01,052 --> 00:08:02,786
Turns out she's been here several times.

188
00:08:02,821 --> 00:08:05,222
Well, when was
the last time she was here?

189
00:08:05,256 --> 00:08:06,957
Two months ago.

190
00:08:06,991 --> 00:08:08,369
All right, Amanda was her counselor.

191
00:08:08,393 --> 00:08:10,127
Amanda.

192
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:13,230
The police are asking about
someone named Isabel Perez.

193
00:08:13,264 --> 00:08:14,865
Why, did something happen to her?

194
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:16,200
We're not sure.

195
00:08:16,234 --> 00:08:17,645
We just want to ask a few questions.

196
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:19,336
Sure. Truth is, I'm glad you're here.

197
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,804
I've been worried about her.

198
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,473
I've been calling and texting her...

199
00:08:22,507 --> 00:08:23,984
When was the last time
you heard from her?

200
00:08:24,008 --> 00:08:25,909
About three weeks ago.

201
00:08:25,944 --> 00:08:29,847
Did she say anything unusual?
Did she seem sad, happy, upset?

202
00:08:29,881 --> 00:08:31,315
More like excited.

203
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:33,517
She was on her way
to get cosmetic surgery.

204
00:08:33,551 --> 00:08:36,820
An injection in her buttocks, I think.

205
00:08:36,855 --> 00:08:40,157
Made me sad. She's so young and pretty,

206
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,860
but her boyfriend
really wanted her to do it

207
00:08:42,894 --> 00:08:44,895
and she wants to make him happy.

208
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:47,831
Did Isabel tell you
the name of her boyfriend?

209
00:08:47,866 --> 00:08:50,234
What about the doctor, or the clinic?

210
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:51,668
No, sorry.

211
00:08:51,703 --> 00:08:53,237
Okay, well, if you hear from her,

212
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:54,438
you call me.

213
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:55,672
Absolutely, and please call

214
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:56,851
if you have any other questions.

215
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,009
Yeah, thanks.

216
00:09:00,378 --> 00:09:02,045
Good to see you, Raul. What's up?

217
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,747
Maria made cheese tamales.

218
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:05,693
Come on, don't tell me
they're against the rules.

219
00:09:05,717 --> 00:09:08,752
- I know you love them.
- I do, thank you.

220
00:09:08,786 --> 00:09:11,121
I wish I had something
to tell you, herma,

221
00:09:11,156 --> 00:09:13,590
but business has been soft.

222
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,193
Haven't installed a drug
compartment in two months.

223
00:09:16,227 --> 00:09:18,028
I came to talk to you
about something else.

224
00:09:18,062 --> 00:09:19,930
There was a murder.
Young woman, twenties.

225
00:09:19,964 --> 00:09:23,700
A murder?
Hell no, that's not for me.

226
00:09:23,735 --> 00:09:25,469
Listen, I tell you
about hidden compartments

227
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,871
in narco's cars. That's our deal.

228
00:09:27,906 --> 00:09:30,146
All right, I didn't come to
talk to you about the murder.

229
00:09:30,175 --> 00:09:32,052
I just wanted to know if you
know of any offthebooks

230
00:09:32,076 --> 00:09:33,810
medical clinics in Pilsen.

231
00:09:33,845 --> 00:09:36,480
Somewhere that women go to get
plastic surgery, injections.

232
00:09:36,514 --> 00:09:38,715
It's your hood, I figured
you might know something.

233
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,385
Yeah, that's easy. Let me ask around.

234
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:42,920
Okay, great. Thank you.

235
00:09:42,954 --> 00:09:44,821
- All right.
- Thank Maria for the tamales.

236
00:09:44,856 --> 00:09:46,056
I will.

237
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:53,330
We got good news.

238
00:09:53,364 --> 00:09:55,399
We got a positive ID on the Jane Doe.

239
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:57,100
She goes by the name of Sylvia Castro.

240
00:09:57,135 --> 00:09:59,803
We stopped by the strip club
that Isabel used to work at.

241
00:09:59,837 --> 00:10:01,505
It turns out Sylvia worked there too.

242
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:03,106
Boss ID'd the crime scene photo,

243
00:10:03,141 --> 00:10:04,852
but he did not know anything
about a boyfriend.

244
00:10:04,876 --> 00:10:06,643
Okay, what else do we know?

245
00:10:06,678 --> 00:10:08,779
We know she's 19,
originally from Cleveland,

246
00:10:08,813 --> 00:10:10,324
and she's been missing from
work for about three months.

247
00:10:10,348 --> 00:10:11,592
All right, track down the family

248
00:10:11,616 --> 00:10:13,350
and let them know what happened.

249
00:10:13,384 --> 00:10:16,119
All right, talk to Sylvia's
friends, coworkers, roommates.

250
00:10:16,154 --> 00:10:18,822
Someone's got to know
who this boyfriend was.

251
00:10:21,192 --> 00:10:22,526
Are you sure this is it?

252
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,094
It's the address Raul gave me.

253
00:10:24,128 --> 00:10:25,529
Doesn't look like a medical clinic.

254
00:10:25,563 --> 00:10:27,965
I think that's the point.

255
00:10:31,135 --> 00:10:32,502
Chicago PD!

256
00:10:32,537 --> 00:10:34,104
- Time to go, ma'am.
- Give me that.

257
00:10:34,138 --> 00:10:35,839
Don't come back.
This isn't a real doctor.

258
00:10:35,873 --> 00:10:37,841
No, no, I never said
I was a real doctor.

259
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,710
I don't operate,
I don't do surgery, I just...

260
00:10:39,744 --> 00:10:41,278
You just inject women with motor oil.

261
00:10:41,312 --> 00:10:43,113
We're trying to find
one of your patients.

262
00:10:43,147 --> 00:10:44,715
Recognize her?

263
00:10:44,749 --> 00:10:47,784
Yeah. Isabella, I think
her last name is Perez.

264
00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:49,029
Okay, what about her boyfriend?

265
00:10:49,053 --> 00:10:50,120
Do you know his name?

266
00:10:50,154 --> 00:10:51,154
No.

267
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:54,791
What about her, you recognize her?

268
00:10:54,826 --> 00:10:56,660
She was one of your patients.

269
00:10:56,694 --> 00:10:58,706
Her name was Sylvia Castro,
same boyfriend as Isabel.

270
00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:59,963
We want a name now.

271
00:10:59,998 --> 00:11:01,632
And given what's going on here,

272
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,200
you're going to want to cooperate.

273
00:11:03,234 --> 00:11:05,354
Because you're going to need
all the help you can get.

274
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:13,143
Hey, Sarge, just talked
to our DOA's sister.

275
00:11:13,177 --> 00:11:14,978
Right before she met
this mystery boyfriend,

276
00:11:15,013 --> 00:11:17,180
she was living in a shelter
called Jenny's Haven.

277
00:11:17,215 --> 00:11:18,582
Wait.

278
00:11:18,616 --> 00:11:20,984
- Did you say Jenny's Haven?
- Yeah.

279
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:22,329
That's the same place Isabel stayed at.

280
00:11:22,353 --> 00:11:23,720
That's now two things

281
00:11:23,755 --> 00:11:25,656
Isabel and our DOA have in common.

282
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,935
They both got plastic surgery
at the same underground clinic.

283
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,193
Paid for by the same guy, Damien Soto.

284
00:11:30,228 --> 00:11:32,696
Yeah, I got him right here. Two priors.

285
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,665
One for assault and battery,
one for pandering.

286
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:35,999
So he's a pimp.

287
00:11:36,034 --> 00:11:37,768
We got a photo of this prick?

288
00:11:37,802 --> 00:11:39,670
All right, give me one sec.

289
00:11:40,905 --> 00:11:44,174
That's Juan. From Jenny's Haven.

290
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,443
You're telling me this guy
works at the shelter?

291
00:11:46,477 --> 00:11:47,878
No, he's the founder.

292
00:11:47,912 --> 00:11:51,048
That's a fox guarding the henhouse.

293
00:11:51,082 --> 00:11:53,717
All right, grab this son of a bitch now.

294
00:11:56,421 --> 00:11:58,221
Chicago PD!

295
00:11:58,256 --> 00:12:00,023
Upton.

296
00:12:00,058 --> 00:12:01,692
Go forward.

297
00:12:01,726 --> 00:12:03,527
- Clear!
- I got the kitchen.

298
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:13,070
Clear.

299
00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:16,373
Three empty beds.

300
00:12:16,407 --> 00:12:19,543
- Well, they left in a hurry.
- Yeah, who tipped them off?

301
00:12:19,577 --> 00:12:21,144
Looks like Isabel wasn't his only girl.

302
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:23,780
You mean prisoner. He's locking them up.

303
00:12:23,815 --> 00:12:26,717
5021 Eddie, roll the crime lab
to 540 Water Street.

304
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,285
We need a scene processed for prints.

305
00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:30,053
<i>Copy that, 5021 Eddie.</i>

306
00:12:30,088 --> 00:12:32,456
Burgess.

307
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,825
I'll be there in 15.

308
00:12:34,859 --> 00:12:36,393
Hey, guys, we're going to break off.

309
00:12:36,427 --> 00:12:38,095
Yeah, copy that.

310
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:40,831
So your friend saw Isabel
on Racine Avenue last night?

311
00:12:40,865 --> 00:12:42,666
Yeah, around midnight.

312
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,468
- She was with some guy.
- Doing what?

313
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:46,336
Don't know, but I'm guessing
looking for dope.

314
00:12:46,371 --> 00:12:48,449
She's got to have it, and
I've been trying to help her,

315
00:12:48,473 --> 00:12:49,439
- but...
- Well, at least you know

316
00:12:49,474 --> 00:12:50,674
she's still alive.

317
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,409
- That's something, right?
- Right.

318
00:12:52,443 --> 00:12:55,112
Now we just need to get her
away from that awful boyfriend.

319
00:12:55,146 --> 00:12:57,914
You mean pimp.
His name is Damien Soto.

320
00:12:57,949 --> 00:13:00,617
He's got six other girls, too.

321
00:13:00,651 --> 00:13:02,352
Makes me sick.

322
00:13:02,387 --> 00:13:04,020
You said Isabel has a drug habit.

323
00:13:04,055 --> 00:13:06,033
That means she'll be looking
to score sometime soon.

324
00:13:06,057 --> 00:13:07,968
So why don't you ask around,
see who's selling to her.

325
00:13:07,992 --> 00:13:09,626
We'll track her down that way.

326
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,029
Walk around Pilsen
talking to heroin dealers?

327
00:13:13,064 --> 00:13:14,197
Nah, I'm clean.

328
00:13:14,232 --> 00:13:15,932
I don't like hanging out in that area.

329
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:19,169
Yeah, that's dangerous, no doubt.

330
00:13:19,203 --> 00:13:20,971
Sienna, we had a deal.

331
00:13:21,005 --> 00:13:22,216
I said if you help find the killer,

332
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,673
I wouldn't file charges.

333
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,042
So far, you haven't done much helping.

334
00:13:26,077 --> 00:13:28,311
Wow. That's pretty hardcore.

335
00:13:28,346 --> 00:13:30,180
Don't blow it.
You're taking cooking classes.

336
00:13:30,214 --> 00:13:31,648
You're working hard to be a chef.

337
00:13:31,682 --> 00:13:33,784
Real hard. And I'm good, too.

338
00:13:33,818 --> 00:13:35,819
It doesn't matter.
If you don't cooperate,

339
00:13:35,853 --> 00:13:38,855
the only place you'll
be cooking is Stateville.

340
00:13:45,096 --> 00:13:47,464
Okay, okay, I'll give it a shot.

341
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:49,900
That's a good choice.

342
00:13:49,934 --> 00:13:51,635
Here's 500, grease the dealers.

343
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:54,738
Tell them there's more cash
if they deliver a lead.

344
00:14:04,582 --> 00:14:07,083
Look, I'm not going to tell
you how to do your job,

345
00:14:07,118 --> 00:14:10,353
but that was pretty hardcore.

346
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:14,491
She's a C.I., Haley.
That's what she signed up for.

347
00:14:19,128 --> 00:14:20,962
So I figured I'd check out
the Latino papers,

348
00:14:20,987 --> 00:14:23,027
see if this pimp was advertising.
Look what I found.

349
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,143
That is definitely Isabel.

350
00:14:25,221 --> 00:14:26,820
So call them, we'll go grab her up.

351
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,087
I already did.
The phone's been disconnected.

352
00:14:28,111 --> 00:14:29,209
The website's down too.

353
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:30,744
He's smart.

354
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:33,414
Staying under the radar
until the heat dies down.

355
00:14:33,448 --> 00:14:35,015
I talked to three current residents

356
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,184
and seven past residents
of Jenny's Haven.

357
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,844
One of the girls was 16.

358
00:14:38,887 --> 00:14:41,120
Damien buys her jewelry,
takes her out to dinner.

359
00:14:41,182 --> 00:14:42,424
What he does is
he treats them like gold,

360
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,065
then turns them out
to the highest bidder.

361
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:45,473
Yeah, and if they get out of line,

362
00:14:45,498 --> 00:14:47,499
he just beats them to death
with a tire iron.

363
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,237
The crime lab
pulled eight sets of prints

364
00:14:49,261 --> 00:14:50,328
from Damien's house,

365
00:14:50,362 --> 00:14:51,896
but the only match is to Damien.

366
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,135
And we also managed

367
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,760
to pick up Damien's vehicle information.

368
00:14:54,815 --> 00:14:56,482
All right, put out a BOLO right away.

369
00:14:56,517 --> 00:14:58,351
In the meantime, hit the streets.

370
00:14:58,393 --> 00:15:00,795
Get his picture out there.

371
00:15:03,424 --> 00:15:05,291
Damien Soto? Never heard of him.

372
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:08,728
We think he runs a small
operation somewhere in Pilsen.

373
00:15:08,762 --> 00:15:10,963
I don't pay much attention
to the mom and pops.

374
00:15:10,998 --> 00:15:14,734
This guy isn't exactly warm and fuzzy.

375
00:15:14,768 --> 00:15:17,537
He killed one of his girls
with a tire iron.

376
00:15:19,173 --> 00:15:22,408
I wish I could help, Hank.
But I don't run in that crowd.

377
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:23,819
You know that.

378
00:15:23,844 --> 00:15:26,245
My girls are highend, educated.

379
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,381
They do what they do
because they want to.

380
00:15:28,415 --> 00:15:29,982
Patricia, I'm not here to judge.

381
00:15:30,017 --> 00:15:33,152
I'm just trying to get some help.

382
00:15:33,187 --> 00:15:35,488
I know, sorry.

383
00:15:35,522 --> 00:15:37,156
So let me ask.

384
00:15:37,191 --> 00:15:38,825
Okay, a guy like that.

385
00:15:38,859 --> 00:15:42,228
You know, a pimp on the lam
afraid to work his girls.

386
00:15:42,262 --> 00:15:44,163
How does he make his money?

387
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:46,399
Well, he can't pimp them,
he'll sell them.

388
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:49,736
It's coldblooded,
but that's how these guys roll.

389
00:15:54,141 --> 00:15:55,508
Thanks.

390
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:58,177
And by the way.

391
00:15:58,212 --> 00:16:00,713
How do you like Nicole?

392
00:16:00,748 --> 00:16:02,548
She's nice.

393
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,117
She says you two just talk.

394
00:16:04,151 --> 00:16:07,186
Like it's a therapy session
or something.

395
00:16:13,994 --> 00:16:15,728
Please tell me you got a lead.

396
00:16:15,763 --> 00:16:17,029
Well, we've been going through

397
00:16:17,064 --> 00:16:18,531
all the surveillance footage we can,

398
00:16:18,565 --> 00:16:20,032
but we're still coming up empty, so.

399
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:21,707
- Any luck with Damien's phone?
- No, sir.

400
00:16:21,735 --> 00:16:23,536
And no hit on the car, either.

401
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,548
Right, well, he has got to
come up for air at some point,

402
00:16:25,572 --> 00:16:27,206
- so stay on it.
- You got it, boss.

403
00:16:27,241 --> 00:16:29,809
I've got patrol canvassing
the neighborhood 24/7.

404
00:16:29,843 --> 00:16:31,654
All right, thanks.
You get word from your C.I.?

405
00:16:31,678 --> 00:16:33,089
Yeah, I talked to her a few hours ago.

406
00:16:33,113 --> 00:16:34,547
She found a dealer

407
00:16:34,581 --> 00:16:36,315
who sold Isabel heroin two days ago.

408
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,951
Said he'd text her again when
Isabel was looking to score.

409
00:16:38,986 --> 00:16:40,720
- Nice.
- Yeah.

410
00:16:43,323 --> 00:16:46,058
Burgess.

411
00:16:46,093 --> 00:16:47,927
What?

412
00:16:47,961 --> 00:16:49,896
When?

413
00:16:52,266 --> 00:16:54,734
Okay, thanks.

414
00:16:54,768 --> 00:16:56,602
Are you okay?

415
00:16:59,706 --> 00:17:03,576
It's just down here.
Shot twice in the chest.

416
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:08,614
Found your number in her cell
on the recently called list.

417
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,318
- Her name is...
- Sienna.

418
00:17:12,352 --> 00:17:16,622
I know, she's my informant.

419
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:28,167
Patrol has found Sienna's
phone at the scene.

420
00:17:28,202 --> 00:17:30,046
She had a text message from
the drug dealer last night

421
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,939
at 10:12, saying he was
meeting up with Isabel

422
00:17:32,973 --> 00:17:35,641
in the park,
same place we found the body.

423
00:17:35,676 --> 00:17:37,043
Could be a robbery?

424
00:17:37,077 --> 00:17:38,945
No, she had her wallet in her pocket.

425
00:17:38,979 --> 00:17:40,123
She had some cash in there, too.

426
00:17:40,147 --> 00:17:41,614
It was a setup.

427
00:17:41,648 --> 00:17:43,549
The dealer texted Damien,
Damien killed her.

428
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:45,885
He didn't want anyone getting
in the way of his business.

429
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,222
Okay, what do we know about this dealer?

430
00:17:49,256 --> 00:17:50,623
Eduardo Varela.

431
00:17:50,657 --> 00:17:52,124
Two priors, heroin distribution.

432
00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:54,794
We have his address, too.
134 Hoover Road.

433
00:17:54,828 --> 00:17:57,029
So pay Eduardo a visit.

434
00:17:57,064 --> 00:17:59,365
And squeeze him. I want answers.

435
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:01,968
Yeah.

436
00:18:02,002 --> 00:18:04,804
- Hey, you all right?
- Yeah.

437
00:18:04,838 --> 00:18:07,373
Listen, I'm sorry about Sienna, but...

438
00:18:07,407 --> 00:18:10,009
You know, that's not on you.

439
00:18:12,713 --> 00:18:14,480
I think I pushed too hard.

440
00:18:14,514 --> 00:18:16,816
No, that's how it goes.

441
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,484
You were doing your job, okay?

442
00:18:18,518 --> 00:18:21,821
You're either playing
or you're getting played.

443
00:18:21,855 --> 00:18:24,323
Okay, let's go talk
to this heroin dealer.

444
00:18:24,358 --> 00:18:25,825
All right?

445
00:18:30,597 --> 00:18:33,833
Chicago PD!

446
00:18:33,867 --> 00:18:36,002
- Hey, you Eduardo Varela?
- What's going on?

447
00:18:36,036 --> 00:18:37,336
Move your punk ass out the way!

448
00:18:37,371 --> 00:18:39,038
You have no right talking
to me like that.

449
00:18:39,072 --> 00:18:40,773
Hey, don't talk to me like that, Eddie,

450
00:18:40,807 --> 00:18:42,018
'cause I'm not in the mood.
Turn around, get your hands up.

451
00:18:42,042 --> 00:18:43,776
Hands up!

452
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,411
- Hey, hey, hey.
- We're good.

453
00:18:45,445 --> 00:18:46,579
All right, sit down.

454
00:18:46,613 --> 00:18:47,680
- Hey.
- Have a seat.

455
00:18:47,714 --> 00:18:49,081
Where's Damien Soto?

456
00:18:49,116 --> 00:18:50,616
Don't know nobody with that name.

457
00:18:50,651 --> 00:18:52,084
Dude, we don't got time for that.

458
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:53,696
We know you just got off
the phone with him

459
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,354
right after you met with Sienna.

460
00:18:55,389 --> 00:18:57,033
And then you sent her a text,
and now she's dead.

461
00:18:57,057 --> 00:18:58,301
Somebody's got to answer
for that, Eddie.

462
00:18:58,325 --> 00:19:00,026
Look what we found.

463
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,795
Heroin? I'm not surprised.

464
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:04,196
You have two choices, Eduardo.

465
00:19:04,231 --> 00:19:05,898
One, we bust you for heroin possession

466
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:07,366
and conspiracy to commit murder.

467
00:19:07,401 --> 00:19:09,302
Or two, you help us find Isabel Perez.

468
00:19:09,336 --> 00:19:12,104
Or Damien Soto's bitch ass.
It's up to you.

469
00:19:12,139 --> 00:19:14,907
Okay, okay. I know who he is.

470
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:16,552
And I know Izzy, but I didn't
help get no one killed.

471
00:19:16,576 --> 00:19:18,044
That's not what I'm about.

472
00:19:18,078 --> 00:19:19,555
Right, because you teach Sunday school.

473
00:19:19,579 --> 00:19:20,913
Damien told me to send that text

474
00:19:20,948 --> 00:19:22,882
so Isabel could talk to her friend.

475
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:25,217
Tell us where Damien Soto is.

476
00:19:25,252 --> 00:19:28,054
I don't know.

477
00:19:28,088 --> 00:19:31,257
But I do know that Izzy's
coming over in a few hours

478
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,925
to score some product.

479
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,604
All right, that wasn't
that hard, was it, Eddie?

480
00:19:34,628 --> 00:19:36,729
Now, you're going to pretend
like everything's normal

481
00:19:36,763 --> 00:19:38,731
and let us do our job.

482
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:41,334
Okay. What happens after that?

483
00:19:41,368 --> 00:19:43,970
You work for me as
an informant or you go to jail.

484
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,182
Antonio, man... now I know why
he's got so many C.I.'s.

485
00:19:56,216 --> 00:19:58,918
He sees the opportunity,
he just makes the ask.

486
00:19:58,952 --> 00:20:00,786
Right? I mean, we were all there.

487
00:20:00,821 --> 00:20:04,256
I feel like Eduardo should be
a group C.I. or something.

488
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,868
I mean, I don't understand
how Antonio gets dibs.

489
00:20:05,892 --> 00:20:07,593
Because he asked.

490
00:20:07,627 --> 00:20:10,162
Hey, look out.

491
00:20:10,197 --> 00:20:12,264
The target has just arrived.

492
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:15,134
It's an unknown driver.
We can't really tell.

493
00:20:17,304 --> 00:20:19,839
We'll take Isabel, you take the driver.

494
00:20:19,873 --> 00:20:21,307
<i>Copy that.</i>

495
00:20:27,981 --> 00:20:31,450
Um, I only have $40 bucks. But I...

496
00:20:31,485 --> 00:20:33,219
No, no, no, no, no.

497
00:20:33,253 --> 00:20:35,654
Hey, hey, it's okay, it's
okay, you're not in trouble.

498
00:20:35,689 --> 00:20:36,856
We're here to help.

499
00:20:47,734 --> 00:20:49,135
Get out the vehicle.

500
00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:50,970
Put your hands where I can see them.

501
00:20:51,004 --> 00:20:53,739
Turn off the car. Turn off the car now!

502
00:20:53,774 --> 00:20:56,375
Hey! Do not move. Do not move.

503
00:20:57,611 --> 00:21:01,013
- Damn!
- Son of a bitch!

504
00:21:01,048 --> 00:21:03,482
Go, go, go, go, go!

505
00:21:14,261 --> 00:21:17,730
Hey, listen.

506
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,532
Hey.

507
00:21:23,136 --> 00:21:25,500
Look, just to be clear...

508
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:29,441
We don't want to press
charges against you, okay?

509
00:21:31,155 --> 00:21:32,978
Where are you living right now?

510
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:37,015
In a house.
But I don't know where it is.

511
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,483
I don't pay attention.

512
00:21:39,147 --> 00:21:42,390
Your boyfriend. This is Damien?

513
00:21:45,287 --> 00:21:47,055
We need to talk to him.

514
00:21:47,282 --> 00:21:48,567
How come?

515
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:51,914
We think he killed a young
woman named Sylvia Castro.

516
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:56,929
And your friend, Sienna.

517
00:21:57,587 --> 00:21:59,000
What?

518
00:21:59,255 --> 00:22:00,898
Yeah.

519
00:22:02,249 --> 00:22:04,192
SSienna's dead?

520
00:22:04,937 --> 00:22:07,106
Died last night.

521
00:22:08,264 --> 00:22:10,365
Damien shot her in the chest twice.

522
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,970
She was trying to find you.
She was trying to help you.

523
00:22:15,004 --> 00:22:19,741
Last night, did Damien
have blood on his clothes?

524
00:22:19,776 --> 00:22:22,845
Hands? Shoes?

525
00:22:24,013 --> 00:22:26,915
Isabel, the other girls
you live with are in danger.

526
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,752
They need your help.

527
00:22:30,787 --> 00:22:35,023
Sorry, I don't remember anything.

528
00:22:40,296 --> 00:22:42,931
Give us a minute. Come on, Kim.

529
00:22:51,441 --> 00:22:53,642
We're not going to get
anything out of her tonight.

530
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:57,179
I think we should just give her
something for her withdrawal,

531
00:22:57,213 --> 00:22:58,691
put her up in one of our safe houses,

532
00:22:58,715 --> 00:23:01,183
let her get some rest.

533
00:23:01,217 --> 00:23:03,118
We'll take another run at her tomorrow.

534
00:23:03,153 --> 00:23:04,653
Okay.

535
00:23:04,687 --> 00:23:06,989
Still haven't found
the driver or the car.

536
00:23:07,023 --> 00:23:08,290
I'm sorry, boss.

537
00:23:08,324 --> 00:23:09,802
He showed up earlier than we thought.

538
00:23:09,826 --> 00:23:11,493
Upton and Olinsky hadn't arrived yet,

539
00:23:11,528 --> 00:23:12,972
but we put the plates out
over the radio.

540
00:23:12,996 --> 00:23:14,163
Just waiting on a hit.

541
00:23:14,197 --> 00:23:15,964
Well, your night isn't over.

542
00:23:15,999 --> 00:23:19,301
I want you to go with Kim,
help get Isabel squared away.

543
00:23:19,335 --> 00:23:21,637
Copy that.

544
00:23:22,906 --> 00:23:26,775
All right, no one knows you're here.

545
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:28,821
Don't open the door unless
you look through the peephole

546
00:23:28,845 --> 00:23:31,313
and you see a badge, all right?

547
00:23:31,347 --> 00:23:32,814
I brought you a change of clothes.

548
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:34,850
You'll feel better after a shower.

549
00:23:34,884 --> 00:23:38,287
And, um, if you need anything,
you use this phone to call us.

550
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:39,788
Okay. Thank you.

551
00:23:39,822 --> 00:23:41,023
Yeah.

552
00:23:41,057 --> 00:23:43,158
So, um, will there be any police around?

553
00:23:43,193 --> 00:23:45,994
Yeah, there will be
a patrol car out front.

554
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:48,130
Do you feel all right
in here by yourself?

555
00:23:48,164 --> 00:23:50,399
Yeah, I'm fine.

556
00:23:50,433 --> 00:23:54,069
- II feel safe.
- Good. You are.

557
00:23:54,103 --> 00:23:55,837
All right, you're all set.

558
00:23:55,872 --> 00:23:59,007
Listen, before we go,
I've got to ask you again.

559
00:23:59,042 --> 00:24:00,709
Where's Damien? Where's he staying?

560
00:24:00,743 --> 00:24:03,011
Adam, would you just stop?
Would you stop?

561
00:24:03,046 --> 00:24:06,381
Stop. She's not ready.

562
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:09,885
You're okay. Get some rest, okay?

563
00:24:23,433 --> 00:24:25,100
Why is she protecting
that son of a bitch?

564
00:24:25,134 --> 00:24:26,902
I don't get it.

565
00:24:26,936 --> 00:24:28,570
Because she's in love with him.

566
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:30,372
In love with him?

567
00:24:30,406 --> 00:24:33,208
- Yeah.
- That's not love.

568
00:24:33,243 --> 00:24:35,677
That's Stockholm Syndrome.

569
00:24:35,712 --> 00:24:37,746
Try telling her it's not love.

570
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:42,951
Sometimes people...

571
00:24:42,986 --> 00:24:44,453
They trick themselves

572
00:24:44,487 --> 00:24:46,065
into believing
what they want to believe,

573
00:24:46,089 --> 00:24:49,725
because it feels better
than the alternative.

574
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:52,894
Well, sometimes it's real.

575
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:55,530
And there's no tricks or delusions.

576
00:24:55,565 --> 00:24:58,066
It's just good.

577
00:24:58,101 --> 00:25:01,470
It might be complicated,
but it's honest.

578
00:25:01,504 --> 00:25:04,573
Come on.

579
00:25:04,607 --> 00:25:05,784
I don't know if leaving the phone

580
00:25:05,808 --> 00:25:07,409
was a really good idea, Kim.

581
00:25:07,443 --> 00:25:09,321
I just, I don't know if
she's going to take the bait.

582
00:25:09,345 --> 00:25:10,879
Whether she loves him or not,

583
00:25:10,913 --> 00:25:12,281
she's terrified of the guy.

584
00:25:12,315 --> 00:25:13,915
Hold on, she's making a call.

585
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,784
<i>- Damien, it's me.
- Where are you, baby?</i>

586
00:25:15,818 --> 00:25:17,486
<i>I've been so worried about you.</i>

587
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,755
<i>The police have me in a safe house.</i>

588
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:22,591
<i>- Are they there?
- Um...</i>

589
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:24,426
<i>No, they left.</i>

590
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,838
<i>Okay, I'll come get you.
But just in case,</i>

591
00:25:25,862 --> 00:25:27,763
<i>meet me a few blocks away.</i>

592
00:25:27,797 --> 00:25:30,932
<i>Okay, meet me in the alley
between Irving and 15th.</i>

593
00:25:30,967 --> 00:25:32,634
<i>I'll be there in 20 minutes.</i>

594
00:25:32,669 --> 00:25:35,504
<i>- I love you, D.
- I love you too, baby.</i>

595
00:25:35,538 --> 00:25:37,272
Isabel just made contact
with Damien Soto.

596
00:25:37,307 --> 00:25:39,441
We have the number she dialed.
I'm calling it in now.

597
00:25:39,475 --> 00:25:41,943
I need someone to ping it, ASAP.

598
00:25:41,978 --> 00:25:45,781
Well, like I said, it was a good idea.

599
00:25:56,392 --> 00:26:00,022
That's a male Hispanic,
approaching from the east.

600
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,631
- Let's go.
- Okay.

601
00:26:05,468 --> 00:26:08,136
- Hey.
- Hey, you good?

602
00:26:08,171 --> 00:26:09,638
Yeah.

603
00:26:09,672 --> 00:26:11,006
Chicago PD!

604
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,441
You set me up, you lying whore!

605
00:26:12,475 --> 00:26:13,842
No, no, don't shoot.

606
00:26:13,876 --> 00:26:15,321
- Drop your weapon!
- I didn't tell them!

607
00:26:15,345 --> 00:26:18,280
Drop your weapon!

608
00:26:18,314 --> 00:26:20,349
- Nice shot.
- No, no!

609
00:26:20,383 --> 00:26:22,127
I didn't know they were here.
I swear I didn't set you up.

610
00:26:22,151 --> 00:26:23,085
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

611
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:25,821
What are you doing here?
Why did you shoot him?

612
00:26:25,855 --> 00:26:28,623
- Please don't die, I love you.
- 1521, Frank emergency.

613
00:26:28,658 --> 00:26:30,325
Shots fired by the police.
Offender down.

614
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,994
- Stop hurting him, please...
- You're okay, just breathe.

615
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:35,464
4200 West Irving, we're in the alley.

616
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,567
Why would you do that?

617
00:26:38,601 --> 00:26:39,835
Copy that.

618
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:43,672
- Just breathe.
- No.

619
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,406
Damien took two to the shoulder.

620
00:26:49,491 --> 00:26:51,724
Yeah, he's in surgery right now.
He's going to live.

621
00:26:51,751 --> 00:26:53,452
All right, where's Isabel?

622
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:55,562
Antonio took her to a clinic.
She's in bad shape.

623
00:26:55,587 --> 00:26:57,644
Between the withdrawals
and seeing Damien get shot,

624
00:26:57,669 --> 00:26:58,935
she's a mess.

625
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,493
Okay, well, what about the phone call?
We got a location?

626
00:27:01,527 --> 00:27:03,086
Yeah, pinged off a cell tower
on the south side,

627
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,251
near a bar named Vinnie's.

628
00:27:04,276 --> 00:27:06,071
The waitress there confirmed
he was there from 10 to 11.

629
00:27:06,095 --> 00:27:08,567
I dumped his phone, but I got nothing.

630
00:27:08,601 --> 00:27:10,836
Checked his car too,
no navigation system.

631
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:14,206
So we still have no idea
where this bastard's living?

632
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,674
Well, Pilsen isn't that big, guys.

633
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:19,047
I want boots on the ground.
Circulate photos of Damien and Isabel.

634
00:27:19,072 --> 00:27:21,056
I mean, you've got C.I.'s in
the area, get on the phone.

635
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,139
Call in a favor.

636
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:25,944
We need to find these girls, soon.

637
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:31,581
Hey, how you doing? How's therapy?

638
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:34,486
Not really my thing.

639
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,448
All right, well, if you're
not going to take it seriously

640
00:27:37,472 --> 00:27:39,958
or even attempt to take it
seriously, let me know.

641
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:43,295
For real, because I need to
find a new partner.

642
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:50,836
This guy, he owns a lot of houses.

643
00:27:51,064 --> 00:27:52,731
Rents them out to pimps, dealers.

644
00:27:52,772 --> 00:27:53,892
He gets a cut of the action.

645
00:27:53,967 --> 00:27:56,951
- You got this guy's name?
- I know of him.

646
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,126
There's six girls out there.

647
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,996
In trouble, locked up.
You'd be doing a good thing.

648
00:28:04,031 --> 00:28:05,898
I ain't in this to be no hero.

649
00:28:05,933 --> 00:28:08,367
I'm just saying,
this isn't our typical deal.

650
00:28:11,305 --> 00:28:13,906
All right, look,
I can get the guy's name.

651
00:28:13,941 --> 00:28:16,409
Problem is, my connect is a Latin Cobra.

652
00:28:16,443 --> 00:28:18,811
- So if you hit the house...
- You could get burnt.

653
00:28:18,845 --> 00:28:20,613
Or get dead.

654
00:28:23,984 --> 00:28:25,985
So you're saying Raul has a lead,

655
00:28:26,019 --> 00:28:27,753
but you told him not to chase it?

656
00:28:27,788 --> 00:28:29,422
Okay, think about it.

657
00:28:29,456 --> 00:28:32,091
Raul asks his Latin Cobra
connect for the address.

658
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:33,670
And then we hit
the house five minutes later.

659
00:28:33,694 --> 00:28:34,994
It doesn't take a lot of math

660
00:28:35,028 --> 00:28:36,595
to figure out who our source is.

661
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,331
So it's okay for my C.I.
to take on a risk,

662
00:28:38,365 --> 00:28:39,999
but not yours.
That's what you're saying?

663
00:28:40,033 --> 00:28:43,202
Kim, he has a wife and two kids.

664
00:28:43,236 --> 00:28:45,148
Not to mention I've known him
for over five years,

665
00:28:45,172 --> 00:28:46,839
and he's given me over 20 cases.

666
00:28:46,873 --> 00:28:49,275
And let's be clear.

667
00:28:49,309 --> 00:28:52,678
It was your choice
to push Sienna, not mine.

668
00:28:52,713 --> 00:28:55,514
I know, because there's
six girls out there,

669
00:28:55,549 --> 00:28:57,683
probably locked in some basement.

670
00:28:57,718 --> 00:28:59,986
And I'm not just going
to sit here and let them die.

671
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,721
I want to find them as badly as you do,

672
00:29:01,755 --> 00:29:04,023
and I will do everything in
my power to make that happen.

673
00:29:04,057 --> 00:29:06,525
Yeah, everything but ask your informant.

674
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:10,129
Raul's job, an informant's job,
is to provide information.

675
00:29:10,163 --> 00:29:12,164
He is an asset of
the Chicago Police Department.

676
00:29:12,199 --> 00:29:15,401
No, he is a person.

677
00:29:15,435 --> 00:29:18,471
And he is a friend.

678
00:29:34,888 --> 00:29:40,059
Damien, hey. Wake up, Chicago PD.

679
00:29:40,093 --> 00:29:42,328
I'm Sergeant Voight,
this is Detective Olinsky.

680
00:29:42,362 --> 00:29:44,063
We need to ask you some questions.

681
00:29:44,097 --> 00:29:46,065
Laywer.

682
00:29:46,099 --> 00:29:48,367
Hey, look at me.

683
00:29:48,402 --> 00:29:51,871
Trust me when I tell you,
this will go a lot easier

684
00:29:51,905 --> 00:29:53,906
if you cooperate.

685
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,708
So where are you keeping the girls?

686
00:29:55,742 --> 00:29:59,045
- You think I'm stupid?
- Well, we already have Isabel.

687
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:01,914
She loves me.

688
00:30:01,948 --> 00:30:04,116
More than you can possibly imagine.

689
00:30:04,151 --> 00:30:06,018
The second you get discharged from here,

690
00:30:06,053 --> 00:30:07,686
you're going to jail.

691
00:30:07,721 --> 00:30:11,357
And those girls, they're going
to find a new pimp.

692
00:30:11,391 --> 00:30:14,593
When they do,

693
00:30:14,628 --> 00:30:17,797
they will give you up
for a slice of pizza.

694
00:30:17,831 --> 00:30:20,066
Well, good thing they're locked up.

695
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,968
And one of them has diabetes, too.

696
00:30:23,003 --> 00:30:24,904
Needs insulin.

697
00:30:24,938 --> 00:30:30,476
Yeah, well, they die,
that just goes on your tab too.

698
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:34,480
So do yourself a favor,
and tell us where they are

699
00:30:34,514 --> 00:30:38,184
while you still have
a chance to make a deal.

700
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,156
All right, I'll tell
you where they are...

701
00:30:44,191 --> 00:30:46,392
When you offer me total immunity.

702
00:30:48,495 --> 00:30:53,699
Until then,
you can kiss my Colombian ass.

703
00:30:56,837 --> 00:31:00,773
Kiss his Colombian ass.

704
00:31:07,814 --> 00:31:11,517
A guy I know,
he had a real bad accident.

705
00:31:11,551 --> 00:31:15,955
A motorcycle accident. It was years ago.

706
00:31:15,989 --> 00:31:18,924
I mean, he was in a lot of pain.

707
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:22,094
He ended up dying in the hospital.

708
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:24,396
But it wasn't from his injuries.

709
00:31:26,199 --> 00:31:28,100
You know what ended up getting him?

710
00:31:28,135 --> 00:31:31,837
A morphine overdose.

711
00:31:34,374 --> 00:31:36,041
You know, they just figured somebody

712
00:31:36,076 --> 00:31:37,309
punched in the wrong numbers.

713
00:31:37,344 --> 00:31:39,445
Happens all the time.

714
00:31:39,479 --> 00:31:43,149
If... if... if I die, so do the girls.

715
00:31:43,183 --> 00:31:47,353
No, we'll just find them
a different way.

716
00:31:47,387 --> 00:31:50,322
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

717
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,593
Last chance, Damien.

718
00:31:57,831 --> 00:32:02,134
Like I said, kiss my ass.

719
00:32:06,273 --> 00:32:10,376
You see this face?
You get a good look at it.

720
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:16,482
It's the last thing
you're ever going to see.

721
00:32:22,122 --> 00:32:23,189
Mr. Soto?

722
00:32:23,223 --> 00:32:25,624
- Hank.
- Excuse me.

723
00:32:27,027 --> 00:32:28,827
Hey, doc.

724
00:32:28,862 --> 00:32:31,597
He's all yours.

725
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:42,032
Son of a bitch could care less
if these girls live or die.

726
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:45,847
They're not girls to him.
They're assets.

727
00:32:46,202 --> 00:32:47,769
A guy like that,

728
00:32:47,821 --> 00:32:50,318
he doesn't let a money maker
die for no reason.

729
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:52,161
Hey, excuse me.

730
00:32:52,234 --> 00:32:54,903
Damien Soto, is he one of your patients?

731
00:32:54,934 --> 00:32:56,434
Yes, why?

732
00:32:56,469 --> 00:32:58,637
I need you to do me a favor.

733
00:32:58,671 --> 00:33:01,800
I want you to leave
a cell phone in Damien's room.

734
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:04,573
Just pretend you forgot it.

735
00:33:05,743 --> 00:33:07,878
<i>- Hello?
- It's me, Damien.</i>

736
00:33:07,912 --> 00:33:10,120
<i>Look, man, I'm in a situation,
like for real.</i>

737
00:33:10,145 --> 00:33:11,148
<i>I need some cash.</i>

738
00:33:11,195 --> 00:33:12,484
<i>So, what are you looking to do?</i>

739
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:14,518
<i>- Sell some product.
- How many you got?</i>

740
00:33:14,552 --> 00:33:15,953
<i>Seven.</i>

741
00:33:15,987 --> 00:33:17,599
The other voice belongs to Cesar Ramos.

742
00:33:17,624 --> 00:33:19,559
He's another pimp working out of Pilsen.

743
00:33:19,584 --> 00:33:22,419
Track him down. And follow him.

744
00:33:38,509 --> 00:33:41,135
Ramos just stopped at
the possible target location.

745
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,261
Get ready to move.

746
00:33:55,126 --> 00:33:57,894
Let's go.

747
00:34:01,228 --> 00:34:05,368
Cesar Ramos, Chicago PD. Turn around.

748
00:34:05,632 --> 00:34:08,267
Drop the bolt cutters. Drop them.

749
00:34:08,302 --> 00:34:11,771
Hands in the air, come down the stairs.

750
00:34:11,805 --> 00:34:14,340
That's it, come on.

751
00:34:17,644 --> 00:34:21,080
Why are you looking at me like that?

752
00:34:21,114 --> 00:34:23,082
Chicago PD!

753
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:27,687
- Let me see your hands.
- It's okay, ladies.

754
00:34:27,721 --> 00:34:29,565
As long as we can see
your hands, you're all good.

755
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:32,191
It's okay, we're the police.
We're here to help.

756
00:34:32,225 --> 00:34:34,927
Hold on, hold on, okay. Okay, go.

757
00:34:34,961 --> 00:34:36,195
I got the kitchen.

758
00:34:36,229 --> 00:34:37,763
- Is she okay?
- Upstairs!

759
00:34:37,798 --> 00:34:40,533
- You're good.
- Okay, you're good. Clear!

760
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,805
Clear!

761
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,474
Burgess.

762
00:34:48,508 --> 00:34:49,909
Clear!

763
00:34:51,845 --> 00:34:56,082
- Anything?
- She didn't make it.

764
00:34:56,116 --> 00:34:57,883
Man.

765
00:34:57,918 --> 00:35:00,319
She must be the diabetic.

766
00:35:06,493 --> 00:35:08,794
I'll go check on the others.

767
00:35:21,942 --> 00:35:25,177
We found the other girls.

768
00:35:25,212 --> 00:35:27,947
One of them was dead.

769
00:35:27,981 --> 00:35:29,515
Because your friend Damien

770
00:35:29,549 --> 00:35:31,517
wouldn't tell us where they were.

771
00:35:31,551 --> 00:35:34,153
We need your help to convict him.

772
00:35:34,187 --> 00:35:35,855
Lydia.

773
00:35:35,889 --> 00:35:39,792
You know Lydia.
She's diabetic, needed insulin.

774
00:35:39,826 --> 00:35:42,328
But Damien didn't care
if she lived or died.

775
00:35:42,362 --> 00:35:44,363
He doesn't care
if any of you live or die.

776
00:35:44,398 --> 00:35:46,132
That's not true.

777
00:35:46,166 --> 00:35:49,535
You know what, actually she's right.

778
00:35:49,569 --> 00:35:53,706
You are right, he did care.
He cared a lot.

779
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:58,577
He wanted you all to live
because he wanted to sell you.

780
00:36:03,316 --> 00:36:07,953
We recorded a call he made today.

781
00:36:07,988 --> 00:36:09,655
<i>It's me, Damien.</i>

782
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:12,725
<i>Look, man, I'm in a situation,
like for real.</i>

783
00:36:12,759 --> 00:36:15,494
<i>- I need some cash, so.
- What are you looking to do?</i>

784
00:36:15,529 --> 00:36:17,363
<i>- Sell some product.
- How many you got?</i>

785
00:36:17,397 --> 00:36:18,864
<i>Seven.</i>

786
00:36:18,899 --> 00:36:22,668
<i>- How much?
- 90K, for all of them.</i>

787
00:36:24,271 --> 00:36:26,172
I can keep playing the tape if you want,

788
00:36:26,206 --> 00:36:28,307
but it's not pretty.

789
00:36:28,341 --> 00:36:30,376
Tell us what you know, Isabel.

790
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:48,727
He doesn't love you, Isabel.

791
00:36:48,762 --> 00:36:51,697
He pretends he does
so he can control you.

792
00:36:54,468 --> 00:36:57,403
Look, I know you want to
believe in your relationship.

793
00:36:57,437 --> 00:37:01,173
You want to hold out hope.
We all do that.

794
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:03,342
But I know that somewhere deep down,

795
00:37:03,376 --> 00:37:06,278
you know that that is a lie.

796
00:37:06,313 --> 00:37:09,081
I know because I've been there.

797
00:37:11,551 --> 00:37:13,853
I was in love with someone once,

798
00:37:13,887 --> 00:37:16,522
and they didn't really love me.

799
00:37:16,556 --> 00:37:19,024
<i>And I kept pretending, and I kept...</i>

800
00:37:19,059 --> 00:37:21,627
<i>Hoping.</i>

801
00:37:21,661 --> 00:37:23,729
And then eventually I just said enough.

802
00:37:23,763 --> 00:37:25,397
God, no more.

803
00:37:25,432 --> 00:37:27,366
And it hurt so much.

804
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:33,539
But you know what?
Eventually, I felt better.

805
00:37:33,573 --> 00:37:37,142
Until one day, I felt whole again.

806
00:37:37,177 --> 00:37:40,412
And now the only thing that I regret

807
00:37:40,447 --> 00:37:42,615
is not doing that sooner.

808
00:37:44,951 --> 00:37:48,387
<i>It's time for you to say enough.</i>

809
00:37:53,493 --> 00:37:56,495
I know where Damien hid the tire iron

810
00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:00,266
that he used to kill Sylvia.

811
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,934
You're good.

812
00:38:13,313 --> 00:38:17,616
It's okay. It's good.

813
00:38:26,326 --> 00:38:29,762
Nice job, Kim. You were amazing.

814
00:38:29,796 --> 00:38:32,331
We have enough
to charge Damien with murder,

815
00:38:32,365 --> 00:38:35,334
so not a bad result,
all things considered.

816
00:38:35,368 --> 00:38:38,203
I'm not so sure about that.

817
00:38:38,238 --> 00:38:40,940
Yeah, I know what you mean.

818
00:38:43,076 --> 00:38:45,210
- You do?
- Yeah.

819
00:38:45,245 --> 00:38:50,115
Look, I don't... I don't
regret protecting my C.I.

820
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:52,184
Not for a second.

821
00:38:52,218 --> 00:38:54,954
But that girl dying, Lydia?

822
00:38:56,756 --> 00:39:00,626
I've got to live with that
for the rest of my life.

823
00:39:03,997 --> 00:39:07,299
It's hard to figure out
what we're supposed to do.

824
00:39:07,334 --> 00:39:12,304
Get the bad guys, save
the victims, protect our C.Is.

825
00:39:12,339 --> 00:39:14,239
I mean, if I didn't push Sienna,

826
00:39:14,274 --> 00:39:17,743
maybe we'd never find
Damien and the girls.

827
00:39:17,777 --> 00:39:20,613
But Sienna would still be alive.

828
00:39:22,882 --> 00:39:26,418
It's a hard needle to thread sometimes.

829
00:39:26,453 --> 00:39:28,988
More like impossible.

830
00:39:29,022 --> 00:39:32,024
You just got to trust your instincts.

831
00:39:32,058 --> 00:39:37,696
Right. Go with your gut, not the book.

832
00:39:37,731 --> 00:39:40,232
- That's right.
- Sweet.

833
00:39:44,471 --> 00:39:46,739
Hey, do you want to grab some dinner

834
00:39:46,773 --> 00:39:49,675
or something this weekend?

835
00:39:49,709 --> 00:39:53,445
Yeah, that sounds good.

836
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,948
Okay, cool.

837
00:39:55,982 --> 00:39:58,817
Cool.

838
00:39:59,886 --> 00:40:03,722
Thanks for seeing me so last minute.

839
00:40:12,332 --> 00:40:15,668
Seems like you're ready to talk.

840
00:40:17,504 --> 00:40:20,673
Yeah, I am.

841
00:40:23,843 --> 00:40:25,911
So that story you told Isabel...

842
00:40:25,945 --> 00:40:29,815
- That wasn't you.
- Good.

843
00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:32,284
- I'm serious.
- Okay.

844
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:34,653
Yeah, I believe you.
But just in case you're lying,

845
00:40:34,688 --> 00:40:36,899
- I would like you to know that...
- Adam, Adam, I was just trying

846
00:40:36,923 --> 00:40:39,925
to get a witness to flip,
simple as that.

847
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:41,337
There's no need to go backwards, okay?

848
00:40:41,361 --> 00:40:43,162
I'm just... I'm not in the mood.

849
00:40:43,196 --> 00:40:46,598
Yeah, well, if you want,
we could head back to my place.

850
00:40:46,633 --> 00:40:47,966
Talk about going backwards.

851
00:40:48,001 --> 00:40:49,178
Maybe we can move things forward.

852
00:40:49,202 --> 00:40:50,569
No, we won't.

853
00:40:50,603 --> 00:40:52,571
Why not? Why not give it a shot?

854
00:40:52,605 --> 00:40:53,972
Because...

855
00:40:54,007 --> 00:40:55,908
I don't know, we work together.

856
00:40:55,942 --> 00:40:58,775
We're in totally different places.

857
00:40:59,212 --> 00:41:00,946
Okay.

858
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,755
Having said that...

859
00:41:09,789 --> 00:41:12,591
I feel like having a little fun tonight.

860
00:41:19,566 --> 00:41:21,433
Let's get out of here.

861
00:41:21,468 --> 00:41:22,935
Okay.

862
00:41:27,213 --> 00:41:32,213

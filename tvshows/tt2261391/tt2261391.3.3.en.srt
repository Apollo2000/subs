1
00:00:00,514 --> 00:00:03,251
Kelly, I'm so sorry about Shay.

2
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:04,514
She was my best friend.

3
00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:05,515
I know.

4
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,516
You went to see

5
00:00:06,551 --> 00:00:07,951
your father's family.

6
00:00:07,985 --> 00:00:09,219
These are not people that you want to know.

7
00:00:09,254 --> 00:00:10,487
I want to know.

8
00:00:10,521 --> 00:00:13,022
How's what's-her-name doing... Dawson?

9
00:00:13,057 --> 00:00:14,858
- Be sure to send her our love.
- Truck 81.

10
00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:17,327
First truck on the scene's in charge.

11
00:00:17,442 --> 00:00:19,475
Do not want to get there behind these guys.

12
00:00:19,509 --> 00:00:21,044
There's nothing personal about this,

13
00:00:21,078 --> 00:00:23,612
but 105 has filled their candidate slot.

14
00:00:23,647 --> 00:00:25,315
I feel responsible. I asked you

15
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:27,250
- to stay at 51 longer...
- Truth is,

16
00:00:27,284 --> 00:00:30,086
Welch was never gonna let
another woman in that slot.

17
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:38,626
Hey, Chief, what's up?

18
00:00:38,661 --> 00:00:40,762
Casey...

19
00:00:40,796 --> 00:00:43,698
I know how we can get Dawson on the truck.

20
00:00:43,903 --> 00:00:46,238
You sure about this?

21
00:00:46,272 --> 00:00:48,006
Answer the question.

22
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:50,142
Do you think it's a good
fit? Are you kidding?

23
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,944
Gabby is gonna be one
hell of a firefighter.

24
00:00:52,978 --> 00:00:55,312
No doubt, but you know what I'm after.

25
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,148
Can the two of you separate
your personal feelings

26
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,983
from your professional responsibilities?

27
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:01,986
Are you really prepared to
overlook the fact that...

28
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:03,021
I am not required to know

29
00:01:03,055 --> 00:01:05,557
all the details of your personal lives.

30
00:01:05,591 --> 00:01:09,726
It is only strictly
prohibited if you are married,

31
00:01:09,761 --> 00:01:12,596
which you are not.

32
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,567
So you take some time, you mull it over.

33
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:18,702
Decision's in your hands.

34
00:01:25,977 --> 00:01:27,578
All right, boys.

35
00:01:27,612 --> 00:01:29,446
Feast your eyes.

36
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,882
- Not bad.
- Huh. Not bad!

37
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:33,183
Yeah, it was a burger truck,

38
00:01:33,217 --> 00:01:34,918
so it's already got most
of the equipment we need.

39
00:01:34,953 --> 00:01:37,554
Look, fryer, gas grill, refrigeration.

40
00:01:37,589 --> 00:01:39,856
"Built-in napkin dispensers."

41
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,091
- Snazzy.
- Mm-hmm.

42
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:43,759
Can't you just picture our logo

43
00:01:43,794 --> 00:01:45,595
on the side of that thing?

44
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:46,996
Molly's II.

45
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,264
Cruz, how much does this thing cost?

46
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,066
That's the best part; It's only 12 grand.

47
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:52,135
- That's not possible.
- Give me the phone number.

48
00:01:52,169 --> 00:01:53,570
Joe, where's it say $12,000?

49
00:01:53,604 --> 00:01:56,172
Right there... 12k.

50
00:01:56,207 --> 00:01:58,975
That's 12,000 miles.

51
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:00,876
The price is...

52
00:02:00,911 --> 00:02:02,945
$79,000.

53
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:07,282
So, before you pitched
Herrmann this great idea,

54
00:02:07,317 --> 00:02:10,886
did you do any research at all

55
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:13,022
on how much it costs to get
a food truck up and running?

56
00:02:13,056 --> 00:02:14,590
The vehicle, the license,
the registration...

57
00:02:14,624 --> 00:02:16,425
All right, all right, I get it, Mouch!

58
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:17,892
You want to point fingers,

59
00:02:17,927 --> 00:02:19,294
or you want to help me find a truck?

60
00:02:20,663 --> 00:02:23,998
Engine 51, Truck 81, Squad 3, Ambulance 61.

61
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:26,167
Structure fire, 16th and Wabash.

62
00:02:33,776 --> 00:02:35,676
I can already see the smoke, boys.

63
00:02:35,711 --> 00:02:37,345
Looks like it's rolling.

64
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,817
Oh, boy. Hey, Casey,

65
00:02:42,852 --> 00:02:45,586
we're neck-and-neck
with your old pal, Welch.

66
00:02:48,257 --> 00:02:50,157
Don't worry, Casey, I got this.

67
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:53,160
I'm not interested in a pissing contest.

68
00:02:53,194 --> 00:02:57,197
If Welch wants this fire, he can have it.

69
00:02:57,232 --> 00:02:59,567
Cruz, forget him.

70
00:02:59,601 --> 00:03:02,436
Just drive the truck.

71
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:05,038
Great. Welch is gonna get there first.

72
00:03:05,073 --> 00:03:06,606
We'll be taking orders from him.

73
00:03:10,145 --> 00:03:14,414
Ah, I don't see 'em.
Maybe they got held up.

74
00:03:14,448 --> 00:03:16,683
See? It all works out

75
00:03:16,717 --> 00:03:17,985
in the end...

76
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,074

Whoa, Severide!

79
00:04:02,496 --> 00:04:05,398
Mayday! Mayday! This is Squad 3 to main!

80
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:07,935
Truck 81 and Truck 66 have collided

81
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:10,403
on the corner of 24th and Wabash.

82
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:13,573
We're gonna need ambulances...
as many as you can get!

83
00:04:13,608 --> 00:04:16,409
This is bad!

84
00:04:16,444 --> 00:04:19,078
Oh, Dawson, that's, like, five blocks back.

85
00:04:19,113 --> 00:04:20,647
- What do we do?
- 61 to main.

86
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:22,181
We're closer to the accident
than we are the fire.

87
00:04:22,216 --> 00:04:23,750
Do you want us to take
the accident instead?

88
00:04:23,784 --> 00:04:26,052
Stand by, 61.

89
00:04:26,086 --> 00:04:28,154
Should I keep driving?

90
00:04:28,188 --> 00:04:30,056
Affirmative, 61. Take in the accident.

91
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,691
Okay, turn around! Go, go, go, go, go!

92
00:04:37,564 --> 00:04:41,200
Confirming that Ttruck 81
and 66 are out of action,

93
00:04:41,235 --> 00:04:43,136
requesting that Squad 3 stay.

94
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,071
Please reassign other
units to the structure fire.

95
00:04:45,105 --> 00:04:47,106
Mills, Capp, Tony... check 66.

96
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:48,741
Newhouse, you're with me.

97
00:04:52,312 --> 00:04:54,446
You guys all right? Any injuries?

98
00:04:54,481 --> 00:04:56,148
Hey, Case, you okay?

99
00:04:56,182 --> 00:04:58,016
Mouch is hurt.

100
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,352
Oh, hell. This is bad.

101
00:05:01,854 --> 00:05:04,690
- Otis, you okay?
- Yeah, but Mouch is bleeding.

102
00:05:06,558 --> 00:05:08,994
- Mouch, talk to me.
- It's my eye.

103
00:05:09,028 --> 00:05:11,263
I hit something... door
frame, I don't know.

104
00:05:11,297 --> 00:05:12,730
Let me see, bud.

105
00:05:12,765 --> 00:05:14,465
All right, don't worry.
We're gonna take care of you.

106
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,334
Herrmann, grab your jump bag.

107
00:05:16,368 --> 00:05:18,603
Newhouse, go down, put pressure on that.

108
00:05:18,637 --> 00:05:19,838
Copy.

109
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:27,779
Cruz, you okay?

110
00:05:27,813 --> 00:05:29,814
Cruz!

111
00:05:29,848 --> 00:05:31,482
We'll get you out.

112
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:36,700
- What do we got?
- We got a whole lot of injuries.

113
00:05:36,702 --> 00:05:37,087
Driver's not responding.

114
00:05:37,122 --> 00:05:38,423
He's pinned in there pretty bad.

115
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:42,226
Hey, Welch, what's his name?

116
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,493
Welch!

117
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:44,929
Molina.

118
00:05:44,963 --> 00:05:46,330
Hey, Molina, can you hear me, bud?

119
00:05:46,364 --> 00:05:47,865
Tell me he's okay. He's okay?

120
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:50,701
I can't find a pulse.
Can... reach in there.

121
00:05:50,735 --> 00:05:52,336
Ah, okay, I feel something, barely.

122
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,206
We got to get him out of here.

123
00:06:02,513 --> 00:06:04,681
- Hey.
- Aah!

124
00:06:04,716 --> 00:06:06,583
- You all right?
- Easy, man, we got you.

125
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:09,353
Don't worry about me.
Parish has got a busted leg.

126
00:06:09,387 --> 00:06:11,588
- The bone showing and everything.
- I'll take care of him, okay?

127
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:12,822
Take a seat over here.

128
00:06:12,857 --> 00:06:14,523
Why don't you guys learn how to drive?

129
00:06:14,558 --> 00:06:16,092
I mean, damn, Lieutenant, what the hell?

130
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,426
- Let's get out of the way.
- No, I'm not going anywhere.

131
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:19,395
Seriously, you look a little pale.

132
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:21,130
Come on, take a seat.

133
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:28,704
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down!

134
00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:30,072
- Hey, hey, hey...
- I'm fine.

135
00:06:30,106 --> 00:06:31,907
- Hey, slow down.
- I'm fine!

136
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,577
Parish, hang in there!

137
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:35,644
Parish!

138
00:06:43,253 --> 00:06:44,887
- Hey, Gabby.
- Matt.

139
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:47,890
I'm okay, but we got a
lot of guys who need help.

140
00:06:47,924 --> 00:06:50,893
He's got a possible broken
arm, multiple lacerations.

141
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:52,327
Guy in the back has a broken leg.

142
00:06:52,362 --> 00:06:54,662
Driver's unconscious, real bad shape.

143
00:06:54,697 --> 00:06:55,730
Mouch got banged up.

144
00:06:55,765 --> 00:06:56,865
I'll go check on Mouch.

145
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,466
All right.

146
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,568
Hey, McFarland, you okay?

147
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:02,003
Yeah.

148
00:07:06,275 --> 00:07:09,176
Mouch, what happened?

149
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:11,413
Let me have a look.

150
00:07:11,447 --> 00:07:12,514
I can't see.

151
00:07:12,548 --> 00:07:14,449
Aw, jeez, I c... can't see!

152
00:07:14,483 --> 00:07:17,485
I don't know what happened.
He came out of nowhere.

153
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,986
Cruz, are you okay?

154
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,487
Why don't you sit.

155
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:28,162
Put me to work, Lieutenant.

156
00:07:28,196 --> 00:07:30,331
Grab a side.

157
00:07:30,365 --> 00:07:31,432
What about the fire?

158
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:32,633
They're dispatching more companies.

159
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:35,201
Don't worry about the fire.

160
00:07:35,236 --> 00:07:37,838
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

161
00:07:37,872 --> 00:07:40,607
We got you, Parish. You're gonna be okay.

162
00:07:44,646 --> 00:07:47,080
Hey, nice driving, genius.

163
00:07:47,114 --> 00:07:49,182
- Hey, man, I...
- Hey, Cruz.

164
00:07:49,216 --> 00:07:51,151
Now's not the time.

165
00:08:03,464 --> 00:08:05,398
You got room for one more?

166
00:08:08,769 --> 00:08:09,936
Oh, my God.

167
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,604
I know, I know.

168
00:08:11,638 --> 00:08:12,839
What happened?

169
00:08:12,873 --> 00:08:15,307
Oh, real simple. 81 blew the light.

170
00:08:15,342 --> 00:08:17,309
We did not blow the light.

171
00:08:17,344 --> 00:08:19,712
Oh, yeah? Which way does your seat face?

172
00:08:19,746 --> 00:08:21,413
- Backwards, but...
- Yeah, so you don't

173
00:08:21,448 --> 00:08:22,949
- Really know, do you?
- Listen...

174
00:08:30,923 --> 00:08:32,624
- Casey.
- Yeah.

175
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:34,493
Are your men okay?

176
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:36,628
All but Mouch. His eye's messed up.

177
00:08:36,662 --> 00:08:38,230
Dawson's taking him to Chicago med.

178
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:40,499
- Is it serious?
- I don't know.

179
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:42,667
He's alive. He's in one piece.

180
00:08:42,702 --> 00:08:43,969
I'm just thankful for that.

181
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:45,136
What about Molina?

182
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,671
He's non-responsive, losing blood.

183
00:08:46,706 --> 00:08:48,139
His legs are crushed.

184
00:08:48,173 --> 00:08:50,108
Cruz...

185
00:08:50,142 --> 00:08:51,476
What happened?

186
00:08:51,511 --> 00:08:53,378
I don't know, Chief.
They came out of nowhere.

187
00:08:53,412 --> 00:08:54,412
- Who had the light?
- We did.

188
00:08:54,446 --> 00:08:55,680
You sure?

189
00:08:55,715 --> 00:08:56,882
If it wasn't green, then it was yellow.

190
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,016
There's no way it was red.

191
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,617
You don't know what color it was?

192
00:08:59,651 --> 00:09:01,785
Cruz, did you see the light?

193
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,988
I must have. I know I did.

194
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:06,690
Chief, it just all happened like that.

195
00:09:09,194 --> 00:09:10,395
Watch his arm. You're too close.

196
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:12,330
I see his arm. I got it.

197
00:09:12,364 --> 00:09:15,432
All right, Mills, go ahead.

198
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:16,967
Mills!

199
00:09:17,002 --> 00:09:19,870
Mills, hey! Mills!

200
00:09:19,905 --> 00:09:22,940
Damn it. What the hell happened, man?

201
00:09:22,974 --> 00:09:24,542
I don't know, I just...
I wasn't paying attention.

202
00:09:24,576 --> 00:09:26,410
Capp, you relieve Mills on the roof.

203
00:09:26,444 --> 00:09:28,412
- Mills, you take a breather.
- No, no, I got it.

204
00:09:28,446 --> 00:09:30,447
- Let's do it!
- Can't you do anything right?

205
00:09:30,481 --> 00:09:31,915
- Hey!
- I got a guy dying here!

206
00:09:31,949 --> 00:09:33,216
Hey, they're giving it their all, Welch.

207
00:09:33,251 --> 00:09:34,851
- We're trying like hell.
- That's my best friend

208
00:09:34,885 --> 00:09:36,153
- in there.
- Yeah, I know.

209
00:09:36,187 --> 00:09:38,121
We're going to get him out.

210
00:09:40,091 --> 00:09:41,724
Who was driving this one?

211
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,060
Right here, Joe Cruz.

212
00:09:43,094 --> 00:09:44,294
Cruz, you want to step aside with us?

213
00:09:44,328 --> 00:09:46,063
Now? We're in the middle of a rescue.

214
00:09:46,097 --> 00:09:48,464
It's okay, Joe. Go with them.

215
00:09:51,835 --> 00:09:54,470
All right, Capp, you ready?

216
00:09:54,504 --> 00:09:55,972
Go.

217
00:09:56,006 --> 00:09:57,941
Come on!

218
00:09:59,242 --> 00:10:00,810
All right, give me a backboard!

219
00:10:00,844 --> 00:10:02,612
Hang in there. Hang in there.

220
00:10:02,646 --> 00:10:03,645
Come on!

221
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:07,083
Come on, get in there.

222
00:10:07,117 --> 00:10:09,818
Blow, please.

223
00:10:09,852 --> 00:10:12,455
Get in there. Get in there... easy.

224
00:10:12,489 --> 00:10:13,689
Hang in there, Molina.

225
00:10:13,723 --> 00:10:15,491
Hold him up. Hold his head up.

226
00:10:15,525 --> 00:10:16,792
Hold his head up.

227
00:10:16,826 --> 00:10:18,760
Three, get him in.

228
00:10:18,795 --> 00:10:20,696
Easy.

229
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,498
Jesus Christ.

230
00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:33,976
You did this, you son of a bitch.

231
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,811
You did this!

232
00:10:54,704 --> 00:10:56,103
I guess they were trying

233
00:10:56,138 --> 00:10:57,404
to cut across from Michigan,

234
00:10:57,438 --> 00:11:00,106
but they had to know we
were coming up Wabash, right?

235
00:11:00,141 --> 00:11:02,643
Either way, they got to
slow down and have a look.

236
00:11:02,677 --> 00:11:04,411
Everyone knows that.

237
00:11:04,445 --> 00:11:05,712
Unless they had the green.

238
00:11:05,746 --> 00:11:07,548
Please. They didn't have the green.

239
00:11:07,582 --> 00:11:09,550
What the hell, Newhouse?

240
00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:10,817
Are the cops still all over Cruz?

241
00:11:10,851 --> 00:11:15,121
Yeah, now they're demanding piss and blood.

242
00:11:15,156 --> 00:11:16,589
Standard procedure.

243
00:11:19,593 --> 00:11:21,728
Is that Molina's wife?

244
00:11:31,505 --> 00:11:33,038
Poor kid.

245
00:11:34,408 --> 00:11:36,375
Can I see him?

246
00:11:41,181 --> 00:11:42,515
You've got a lot of debris in there.

247
00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:44,283
I'm going to have to clean that out.

248
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:45,918
But the injury didn't penetrate the cornea,

249
00:11:45,952 --> 00:11:48,120
and that tissue heals quickly.

250
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:50,723
So I'll be able to see out of that eye?

251
00:11:50,757 --> 00:11:52,791
Vision should be fully restored, yes.

252
00:11:52,826 --> 00:11:55,894
Oh, thank God.

253
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:57,495
Okay.

254
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,364
I'm not denying there's been some bad blood

255
00:11:59,398 --> 00:12:01,399
between Lieutenant Welch and myself,

256
00:12:01,434 --> 00:12:03,468
but it didn't play a
role in this accident...

257
00:12:03,502 --> 00:12:04,902
not on our end, anyway.

258
00:12:04,937 --> 00:12:07,939
Are you sure that 81 had the right of way?

259
00:12:07,973 --> 00:12:11,075
I didn't see the light myself,
but I trust Joe Cruz implicitly.

260
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,577
Even though he doesn't remember

261
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:13,911
seeing the light either?

262
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:15,079
If the light was red,

263
00:12:15,114 --> 00:12:17,382
he'd have come to a controlled stop.

264
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,117
He's good at his job.

265
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:20,752
Here's the problem, Casey.

266
00:12:20,786 --> 00:12:22,553
The cops still haven't found
a credible eye witnesses.

267
00:12:22,587 --> 00:12:24,789
There's no traffic cam
at that intersection.

268
00:12:24,823 --> 00:12:26,323
And, of the two drivers involved,

269
00:12:26,358 --> 00:12:28,325
one can't remember what
color the light was,

270
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,695
and one might not live through the night.

271
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,765
I stand by Joe Cruz.

272
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:38,369
That's all for now.

273
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:43,707
Hey.

274
00:12:43,742 --> 00:12:46,042
Wait, wait, sorry, not here.

275
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:51,715
Um...

276
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,416
Good news on Mouch.

277
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,518
He's still gonna be able
to watch TV with both eyes.

278
00:12:55,552 --> 00:12:57,720
Good. That's really good.

279
00:12:57,755 --> 00:12:59,489
I'm going to check in on him.

280
00:13:17,308 --> 00:13:21,577
Okay, everyone from 51... let's move out.

281
00:13:21,612 --> 00:13:23,979
Nothing more we can do here.

282
00:13:32,155 --> 00:13:34,256
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

283
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,025
Pretty nasty spill you had back there.

284
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:37,426
What happened?

285
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,328
Yeah, just got sloppy, I guess.

286
00:13:39,362 --> 00:13:41,596
You don't get sloppy, Mills.

287
00:13:41,631 --> 00:13:44,466
It's nothing, I, um... I'm getting dizzy.

288
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,234
Since when?

289
00:13:46,268 --> 00:13:48,403
Since the building collapse, I guess.

290
00:13:48,438 --> 00:13:49,805
It's all those pain meds for my leg.

291
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,174
It's just taking a while to go away.

292
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:55,276
Go see a doctor.

293
00:13:55,311 --> 00:13:57,078
Yeah, I will if doesn't clear up soon...

294
00:13:57,112 --> 00:13:58,814
Before next shift.

295
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:22,336
We should have a spare truck
here from the shop pretty soon.

296
00:14:22,371 --> 00:14:25,939
That old beast with the bad clutch?

297
00:14:25,974 --> 00:14:28,509
We gonna get anybody to fill in for Mouch?

298
00:14:28,543 --> 00:14:31,144
I'm rehiring the whole crew.

299
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:33,146
You guys are done with your shift.

300
00:14:33,181 --> 00:14:35,215
Chief, that's not necessary.

301
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,451
You've been rattled.

302
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:40,187
Go home and rest.

303
00:15:07,014 --> 00:15:08,747
I've seen a lot worse.

304
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,083
You're lucky you didn't
break that leg again.

305
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,751
Yeah.

306
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,553
I'll just be more careful, huh?

307
00:15:14,587 --> 00:15:16,188
I understand that you, uh...

308
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,457
reached out to your dad's family.

309
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:23,965
I know Newhouse didn't go

310
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:25,433
shooting off his mouth about that,

311
00:15:25,468 --> 00:15:27,602
so my mom must have called you,

312
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:28,903
asked you to get involved.

313
00:15:28,938 --> 00:15:31,739
Yeah, I ran into her in the bank.

314
00:15:31,774 --> 00:15:33,975
Either way, um...

315
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:35,643
you can tell her that I'm over it,

316
00:15:35,678 --> 00:15:37,846
that it was just a passing interest.

317
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,682
Yeah, I told her I thought
it was a great idea.

318
00:15:41,716 --> 00:15:46,520
See, your dad, he always talked
a lot about his family, and...

319
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:48,990
He wanted to patch things up.

320
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,394
Why didn't he?

321
00:15:53,428 --> 00:15:56,930
Something always came up,

322
00:15:56,965 --> 00:16:00,433
always some reason not
to take the hard road.

323
00:16:00,468 --> 00:16:02,603
But I know that he regretted it.

324
00:16:02,637 --> 00:16:04,471
He died with that hanging over him.

325
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:08,341
He wanted his children to
know where they came from.

326
00:16:11,612 --> 00:16:13,613
You know what? I think I found out

327
00:16:13,647 --> 00:16:16,749
all that I need to know.

328
00:16:16,783 --> 00:16:18,184
Peter.

329
00:16:18,219 --> 00:16:20,553
Um... pardon me, Chief.

330
00:16:20,587 --> 00:16:22,522
Chief Tiberg is here to see you.

331
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:26,893
Thank you, Connie.

332
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:36,536
Do I have clearance to hug you now?

333
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,004
You do.

334
00:16:40,173 --> 00:16:44,343
Man, when that mayday came through...

335
00:16:44,377 --> 00:16:47,946
I know.

336
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,481
But I'm okay.

337
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,785
Boden's sending you guys home, huh?

338
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:58,157
Yeah. He looks out for his people.

339
00:16:58,191 --> 00:17:01,292
In fact, maybe you
should sit down for this.

340
00:17:06,065 --> 00:17:08,332
So, uh...

341
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,004
Boden and I have been
talking about making you

342
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,474
our candidate on Truck 81.

343
00:17:16,508 --> 00:17:19,544
He's willing to turn a blind
eye to our relationship.

344
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:21,112
So if this is something
you're interested in...

345
00:17:21,146 --> 00:17:22,213
Yeah... yes.

346
00:17:22,247 --> 00:17:25,349
Yes, absolutely yes.

347
00:17:25,384 --> 00:17:29,120
Okay, well, great.

348
00:17:30,855 --> 00:17:32,923
Ambulance 61. Chest pains.

349
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,124
Polk and Clinton.

350
00:17:34,158 --> 00:17:35,525
We can talk about the details later.

351
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,327
This... this is amazing.

352
00:17:45,837 --> 00:17:48,338
We should take turns
standing watch for Molina.

353
00:17:48,372 --> 00:17:51,074
Make sure somebody from 81 is
at the hospital at all times.

354
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:52,542
All right. I'll go straight there,

355
00:17:52,577 --> 00:17:54,010
if someone can relieve me tonight.

356
00:17:54,044 --> 00:17:55,445
Cruz and I are going
to run down to Roseland,

357
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,013
take a look at that old hot dog truck.

358
00:17:57,047 --> 00:17:58,215
But then we'll swing by.

359
00:17:58,249 --> 00:18:00,250
Casey, Cruz...

360
00:18:04,489 --> 00:18:06,055
Over here now.

361
00:18:12,896 --> 00:18:14,230
What's this?

362
00:18:17,534 --> 00:18:20,402
I thought there was no traffic
camera at 24th and Wabash.

363
00:18:20,437 --> 00:18:22,105
This is four blocks south.

364
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:24,006
And there's 81 racing through a red light,

365
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,443
30 seconds before the collision.

366
00:18:27,477 --> 00:18:30,546
- That was a controlled stop.
- Controlled stop, my ass.

367
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,215
You blew that light at 20
miles an hour, at least.

368
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,318
Chief, everybody breaks
the controlled stop rule.

369
00:18:36,353 --> 00:18:37,886
- You pretty much have to.
- That's your defense?

370
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,088
"All the kids are doing it"?

371
00:18:40,123 --> 00:18:41,356
Chief, you want to back me up here?

372
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,224
I would stop talking now, Joe.

373
00:18:46,129 --> 00:18:47,696
We were on our way to a fire.

374
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,765
If we made a controlled
stop at every light, there...

375
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,533
Then Molina would be back at his firehouse

376
00:18:51,567 --> 00:18:54,435
instead of on life support.

377
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,704
Cruz, you should talk to your union rep

378
00:18:56,738 --> 00:18:58,606
before you say another word.

379
00:18:58,641 --> 00:19:01,676
Better yet, a criminal lawyer.

380
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,011
If Molina can't pull out of this,

381
00:19:04,046 --> 00:19:06,214
you're looking at manslaughter charges.

382
00:19:23,294 --> 00:19:24,592
- Hey.
- Hey.

383
00:19:24,627 --> 00:19:27,162
How was the rest of shift?

384
00:19:27,197 --> 00:19:30,799
More restful than your
evening, from the looks of it.

385
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:32,767
How's Cruz?

386
00:19:32,802 --> 00:19:36,137
He's a tough guy, but, man...

387
00:19:36,171 --> 00:19:37,339
This isn't fair.

388
00:19:37,373 --> 00:19:38,440
Yeah.

389
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:44,912
Listen, um... I realize
that I was pretty quick

390
00:19:44,947 --> 00:19:47,782
to respond yesterday about joining 81.

391
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:49,283
You were excited.

392
00:19:49,318 --> 00:19:51,152
Yeah, I still am.

393
00:19:51,186 --> 00:19:54,956
But I also get that maybe there needs to be

394
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,224
more of a conversation.

395
00:19:56,258 --> 00:19:58,759
There's a lot to it, that's for sure.

396
00:19:58,793 --> 00:20:00,928
We're not actually gonna
be able to get married, huh?

397
00:20:00,963 --> 00:20:03,130
As long as I'm working under you?

398
00:20:03,165 --> 00:20:05,632
Well, we'd have to put the wedding on hold,

399
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:09,102
at least until you've completed
your first year as candidate.

400
00:20:09,136 --> 00:20:11,905
Then you'd have to transfer
to another shift or company.

401
00:20:14,843 --> 00:20:16,943
This would really affect us,

402
00:20:16,978 --> 00:20:19,480
professionally and personally.

403
00:20:19,514 --> 00:20:21,782
And I feel bad because
I'm the one who benefits.

404
00:20:21,816 --> 00:20:23,917
We'd both get something out of it.

405
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:28,989
You'd be willing to put me in harm's way?

406
00:20:29,023 --> 00:20:32,125
I'd assign you any task
I think you're capable of.

407
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,861
And if I stepped out of
line, you'd discipline me?

408
00:20:34,896 --> 00:20:36,930
With great enthusiasm.

409
00:20:41,068 --> 00:20:43,536
If you didn't think this was a good idea,

410
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,737
would you tell me?

411
00:20:44,772 --> 00:20:46,038
Of course.

412
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:53,679
Everyone's meeting at the hospital.

413
00:20:53,714 --> 00:20:55,782
Yeah, we should go.

414
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,521
What's the upshot on that hot dog truck?

415
00:21:02,555 --> 00:21:04,990
Oh, guy sold it before we could get there.

416
00:21:05,025 --> 00:21:06,725
I was busy arranging a sit-down

417
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:09,995
between Cruz and a criminal
lawyer friend of my brother's.

418
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,998
- That's probably a smart move.
- Except Cruz never showed up.

419
00:21:13,033 --> 00:21:17,068
I don't need a lawyer. I
didn't do anything wrong.

420
00:21:18,137 --> 00:21:19,337
Hey.

421
00:21:19,371 --> 00:21:21,773
What's the word?

422
00:21:21,808 --> 00:21:23,174
Molina's out of surgery,

423
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,276
but they're keeping him
under due to brain swelling.

424
00:21:25,311 --> 00:21:26,978
It doesn't look good.

425
00:21:27,012 --> 00:21:28,112
Damn.

426
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,583
Hey, I'll be right back.

427
00:21:39,891 --> 00:21:42,427
- Lieutenant Welch.
- Yeah?

428
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,965
I just wanted to let you know

429
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:48,799
that I feel awful about the accident.

430
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:50,935
Yeah, I should hope so.

431
00:21:54,172 --> 00:21:55,673
Okay, look, I just came by to say

432
00:21:55,707 --> 00:21:57,307
if there's anything that I
can do for Molina's people,

433
00:21:57,342 --> 00:21:59,710
or for you and your guys... sure, there is.

434
00:21:59,744 --> 00:22:01,512
Get your eyes checked.

435
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,216
You know what?

436
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,484
I feel for Molina.

437
00:22:07,518 --> 00:22:09,152
I do.

438
00:22:09,187 --> 00:22:10,753
But this wasn't my fault.

439
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:13,256
Molina is ten times
the firefighter you are.

440
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,058
Hey, come on.

441
00:22:15,093 --> 00:22:16,593
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- Hey, hey.

442
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:19,162
I'm sick and tired of getting
the stink-eye everywhere I go!

443
00:22:19,197 --> 00:22:20,297
I know.

444
00:22:20,331 --> 00:22:22,565
C'mon, guys, why hash this out now?

445
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,400
Let's let the white shirts handle this.

446
00:22:24,434 --> 00:22:25,702
Just keep that bald-headed
douche away from me,

447
00:22:25,736 --> 00:22:26,870
or I'll put him in a coma.

448
00:22:26,904 --> 00:22:27,871
Hey, hey, hey!

449
00:22:27,905 --> 00:22:29,238
- Welch.
- Joe.

450
00:22:29,272 --> 00:22:31,941
We're all here for the same reason.

451
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,910
We want Molina home, safe and sound,

452
00:22:33,944 --> 00:22:35,144
and then God willing,

453
00:22:35,178 --> 00:22:37,646
be back on the job as soon as possible.

454
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,815
Back on the job? The
guy could be brain dead.

455
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:41,750
All right.

456
00:22:41,784 --> 00:22:45,821
Look, what are you guys
doing for his family?

457
00:22:45,855 --> 00:22:48,624
You got anything planned?

458
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,660
We're still figuring that out.

459
00:22:51,694 --> 00:22:53,462
Let me offer up Molly's.

460
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,665
We'll host a thing, both houses.

461
00:22:56,699 --> 00:22:58,299
You guys in?

462
00:23:00,603 --> 00:23:03,505
Is he gonna be there?

463
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,440
Everybody's invited.

464
00:23:05,474 --> 00:23:08,810
You want to help Molina out or not?

465
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,311
Of course.

466
00:23:15,617 --> 00:23:18,819
Listen, you should go.

467
00:23:18,854 --> 00:23:20,455
What? No.

468
00:23:20,489 --> 00:23:21,923
I got every right to be here.

469
00:23:21,957 --> 00:23:23,224
I leave now, I look guilty.

470
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:24,426
No.

471
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,227
You look like the bigger man.

472
00:23:30,632 --> 00:23:31,899
Come on.

473
00:23:41,443 --> 00:23:43,643
Oh.

474
00:23:43,678 --> 00:23:45,279
Sorry, Lieutenant.

475
00:23:46,381 --> 00:23:47,681
Everybody's inside.

476
00:23:47,715 --> 00:23:49,083
I know.

477
00:23:54,255 --> 00:23:56,123
So what are you doing out here?

478
00:23:58,493 --> 00:23:59,960
Molina wake up yet?

479
00:24:07,267 --> 00:24:09,535
I can't do another funeral
for a line-of-duty death, man.

480
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,237
I just can't.

481
00:24:20,947 --> 00:24:22,915
Yeah, I hear that.

482
00:24:41,234 --> 00:24:43,702
All right, now just keep your eyes open.

483
00:24:43,737 --> 00:24:45,237
Okay.

484
00:24:47,974 --> 00:24:50,609
And hold this position.

485
00:24:50,643 --> 00:24:55,347
Still holding, still holding.

486
00:24:55,381 --> 00:24:56,881
And there it is.

487
00:24:56,915 --> 00:24:57,882
You feel that?

488
00:24:57,916 --> 00:24:58,883
Yeah.

489
00:24:58,917 --> 00:25:01,686
All right.

490
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,821
Now, that eye movement is called nystagmus,

491
00:25:03,856 --> 00:25:05,257
and what it tells me is

492
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:09,527
you've got benign paroxysmal
positional vertigo: BPPV.

493
00:25:09,561 --> 00:25:10,962
Yeah, that's what I thought.

494
00:25:10,996 --> 00:25:13,230
I've been trying all those
rehabilitation exercises...

495
00:25:13,265 --> 00:25:17,001
the... the Epley Maneuver
and a couple others...

496
00:25:17,036 --> 00:25:18,169
for the last month or so.

497
00:25:18,203 --> 00:25:19,570
Still no improvement in your equilibrium?

498
00:25:19,604 --> 00:25:21,005
No.

499
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,773
The vestibular organs in your right ear

500
00:25:22,807 --> 00:25:25,942
probably suffered blast trauma
in the building collapse.

501
00:25:25,977 --> 00:25:28,279
I guess we were so focused
on your leg, we didn't notice.

502
00:25:28,313 --> 00:25:29,913
Yeah.

503
00:25:29,947 --> 00:25:33,584
Well, now that we know, what do we do?

504
00:25:35,853 --> 00:25:39,089
The main thing I need you to understand is

505
00:25:39,123 --> 00:25:41,424
I can't clear you for Squad duty.

506
00:25:45,797 --> 00:25:47,798
Um...

507
00:25:49,934 --> 00:25:52,803
Dr. Bachman, come on.

508
00:25:52,837 --> 00:25:54,337
Um...

509
00:25:54,371 --> 00:25:56,839
I just got back to work.

510
00:25:56,873 --> 00:25:58,341
What about medication?

511
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:00,243
That'll only mask the symptoms.

512
00:26:00,277 --> 00:26:01,678
I still can't let you climb ladders

513
00:26:01,712 --> 00:26:03,746
or do rope work or scuba dive.

514
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,718
What the hell do I do? I mean...

515
00:26:08,752 --> 00:26:10,119
You're just telling me that I'm done.

516
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:11,987
Peter, this condition is mild.

517
00:26:12,022 --> 00:26:14,957
There are lots of careers
you could still perform.

518
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:16,592
Yeah, just not this one.

519
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:21,931
I'm a firefighter, okay?

520
00:26:21,965 --> 00:26:25,567
And if I'm not that, then what am I?

521
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:43,926
You were right, Cruz. They gave us
the old beast wwith the bad clutch.

522
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,995
I think they did it to punish us.

523
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:50,498
Ugh, this thing is a bitch to drive.

524
00:26:50,533 --> 00:26:53,968
Yeah, well, uh... about that, um...

525
00:26:54,002 --> 00:26:56,738
Your driving privileges
have been suspended,

526
00:26:56,772 --> 00:26:59,273
pending the investigation.

527
00:26:59,308 --> 00:27:02,109
Otis, you're driving for now.

528
00:27:02,144 --> 00:27:03,645
Seriously?

529
00:27:08,317 --> 00:27:12,119
This is a total crock, dude.

530
00:27:12,154 --> 00:27:14,655
Don't worry... it's all
going to work itself out.

531
00:27:14,689 --> 00:27:18,292
Hey, Joe... Molina's going to make it.

532
00:27:18,327 --> 00:27:20,861
Somebody's gonna come forward,
testify you had the light.

533
00:27:23,565 --> 00:27:25,666
Oh, boy, look here!

534
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,968
Argh! Argh!

535
00:27:28,002 --> 00:27:29,937
- Hey, boys.
- Mr. Mouch.

536
00:27:29,971 --> 00:27:31,171
Why aren't you home resting?

537
00:27:31,205 --> 00:27:34,007
I need to be around my brothers.

538
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:35,742
Ow. How's your peeper?

539
00:27:35,777 --> 00:27:37,410
Well, you know,

540
00:27:37,445 --> 00:27:42,349
I'm, uh, dealing with a fairly
serious corneal abrasion,

541
00:27:42,383 --> 00:27:44,684
and all that that entails, so...

542
00:27:44,718 --> 00:27:47,820
What does that entail?

543
00:27:47,855 --> 00:27:50,423
Eyedrops, mainly.

544
00:27:55,229 --> 00:27:56,562
- Hey.
- Hey, Chief.

545
00:27:56,597 --> 00:27:57,730
Is Mills out sick or something?

546
00:27:57,764 --> 00:27:58,831
I'm missing a man.

547
00:27:58,866 --> 00:28:00,399
You haven't spoken to him?

548
00:28:02,703 --> 00:28:04,336
He left me a message or two the other day.

549
00:28:04,371 --> 00:28:06,238
I guess I forgot to call him.

550
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,940
Severide, when you go off shift lately,

551
00:28:07,975 --> 00:28:09,609
you go into a 48-hour black hole.

552
00:28:09,643 --> 00:28:11,744
Why is that?

553
00:28:11,778 --> 00:28:14,279
Chief, I'm just trying to find Mills.

554
00:28:14,314 --> 00:28:16,148
Peter Mills failed his medical examination,

555
00:28:16,182 --> 00:28:18,417
and he is off Squad.

556
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,424
Yeah.

557
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:28,460
Maybe you should reach out to him.

558
00:28:28,495 --> 00:28:29,461
Right, yeah.

559
00:28:29,496 --> 00:28:31,130
Absolutely.

560
00:28:37,469 --> 00:28:39,203
Hey, this is Pete. Leave a message.

561
00:28:39,238 --> 00:28:41,706
Mills, hey, it's Severide.

562
00:28:41,741 --> 00:28:44,543
Boden told me the news. Um...

563
00:28:44,577 --> 00:28:46,244
Must've been something wrong with my phone.

564
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:48,112
I didn't see your messages until now.

565
00:28:48,147 --> 00:28:51,082
Anyway, uh, give me a call.

566
00:28:56,955 --> 00:28:58,222
Hey, Chief.

567
00:29:01,993 --> 00:29:04,162
Casey told me what you were
willing to do on my behalf.

568
00:29:04,196 --> 00:29:05,863
Yeah, well, I was appreciative

569
00:29:05,897 --> 00:29:07,431
of what you did for me and for this house.

570
00:29:07,465 --> 00:29:08,732
Oh, yeah, of course.

571
00:29:08,767 --> 00:29:09,934
But I know how you feel

572
00:29:09,968 --> 00:29:12,570
about officers and
firefighters commingling,

573
00:29:12,604 --> 00:29:16,073
and I just want to let you
know that Casey and I...

574
00:29:16,107 --> 00:29:17,441
We get it.

575
00:29:17,475 --> 00:29:19,910
- The job comes first.
- Right.

576
00:29:19,945 --> 00:29:22,345
And we acknowledge that
this kind of arrangement

577
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,646
could put a lot of pressure on us,

578
00:29:23,681 --> 00:29:27,250
but I feel confident
that we can deal with it.

579
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,956
We're taking this very seriously.

580
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:35,092
Good to hear.

581
00:29:35,126 --> 00:29:36,926
You tell me what you decide.

582
00:29:39,797 --> 00:29:41,764
Okay, will do, Chief, thanks.

583
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:43,365
Hm.

584
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,504
So our beer distributor

585
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:50,206
is going to donate a couple kegs of beer,

586
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,042
and my cousin Mikey is
gonna loan us a P.A. system,

587
00:29:53,077 --> 00:29:56,178
which, knowing Mikey, is
gonna be a karaoke machine.

588
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:58,147
It's your funeral, Christopher.

589
00:29:58,181 --> 00:29:59,415
Trudy!

590
00:29:59,449 --> 00:30:00,882
No, no, don't you get up.

591
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:02,551
How are you, hon?

592
00:30:02,586 --> 00:30:05,588
- Eh, you know.
- Ohh...

593
00:30:05,622 --> 00:30:06,855
- Are those brownies?
- I'm sorry.

594
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:10,025
Were you blinded in one eye?

595
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:11,426
Do you want to put your feet up, hon?

596
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,628
- I do.
- Hey, uh, Mustache,

597
00:30:12,662 --> 00:30:15,163
you want to get him a pillow?

598
00:30:15,197 --> 00:30:16,464
Hey, hey, hey, get back here!

599
00:30:16,499 --> 00:30:18,967
You think this fundraiser
is going to plan itself?

600
00:30:19,002 --> 00:30:20,636
Oh, for that poor fireman?

601
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,771
Hey, you know who throws a great party?

602
00:30:22,805 --> 00:30:24,506
Atwater. You want me to tell him

603
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,775
- you guys need a hand?
- Yeah we already talked to him.

604
00:30:26,809 --> 00:30:28,243
- He's busy.
- He'll be there.

605
00:30:28,277 --> 00:30:29,944
Yo, pillow?

606
00:30:29,978 --> 00:30:31,346
Isn't she great?

607
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,648
Mouch, Cruz... Newhouse wants you.

608
00:30:44,225 --> 00:30:46,694
Ask, and you shall receive.

609
00:30:46,728 --> 00:30:49,163
Where'd this come from?

610
00:30:49,197 --> 00:30:51,198
Guy I met during a thing.

611
00:30:51,232 --> 00:30:52,833
That's not an explanation.

612
00:30:52,868 --> 00:30:55,002
Is that a bullet hole?

613
00:30:55,037 --> 00:30:58,238
Yeah, well, I can throw in a can of Bondo.

614
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,940
Newhouse, who owns this thing?

615
00:31:00,975 --> 00:31:02,543
Say the word, and you do.

616
00:31:02,577 --> 00:31:03,710
Really?

617
00:31:03,744 --> 00:31:06,079
For how much?

618
00:31:06,113 --> 00:31:09,383
Let's say, 20% of Molly's II.

619
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:13,953
You want to be a partner?

620
00:31:24,565 --> 00:31:28,968
That's Leonard Mills, in the wheelchair.

621
00:31:29,003 --> 00:31:30,970
What's wrong with him? Is he sick?

622
00:31:31,005 --> 00:31:32,839
Yes, he's stage four.

623
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,879
Thank you.

624
00:31:47,921 --> 00:31:50,522
Excuse me, Leonard Mills?

625
00:31:50,556 --> 00:31:53,826
I already told the other
one, I'm not hungry.

626
00:32:00,633 --> 00:32:02,735
You're not an orderly.

627
00:32:06,772 --> 00:32:07,872
No.

628
00:32:07,906 --> 00:32:09,608
No, I'm not.

629
00:32:12,578 --> 00:32:14,912
You're a fireman.

630
00:32:28,227 --> 00:32:31,763
You look just like your mother.

631
00:32:31,797 --> 00:32:34,766
Yeah, you're damn right I do.

632
00:32:39,004 --> 00:32:42,306
So I guess I'm your grandfather.

633
00:32:44,008 --> 00:32:46,343
I guess so.

634
00:32:59,957 --> 00:33:01,457
Peter...

635
00:33:04,262 --> 00:33:05,929
Peter...

636
00:33:11,169 --> 00:33:14,404
I sure am glad to know you.

637
00:33:32,455 --> 00:33:35,422
I mean, he trotted out the
usual excuses, you know?

638
00:33:35,457 --> 00:33:37,324
"Times were different, blah, blah, blah."

639
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,861
Whatever.

640
00:33:42,698 --> 00:33:46,200
I saw a lot of my father in him.

641
00:33:46,234 --> 00:33:48,435
He asked me if I was
a firefighter like dad.

642
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,337
I couldn't bring myself to admit the truth,

643
00:33:50,371 --> 00:33:54,208
that... I'm not anymore.

644
00:33:54,242 --> 00:33:57,911
Mills, I don't get how this
thing is ending your career.

645
00:33:57,945 --> 00:34:01,848
I mean, it's not keeping you
off the basketball court, right?

646
00:34:01,882 --> 00:34:04,084
It's fine as long as I'm upright.

647
00:34:04,118 --> 00:34:06,653
But firefighting is out of the question.

648
00:34:06,687 --> 00:34:11,157
So there's no chance that this
thing could clear up someday?

649
00:34:11,191 --> 00:34:12,926
Yeah, someday.

650
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,429
Newhouse, when I was a kid,

651
00:34:16,463 --> 00:34:18,197
I used to think it was okay to say

652
00:34:18,232 --> 00:34:21,167
that I'm gonna be a firefighter someday.

653
00:34:21,201 --> 00:34:23,002
I ain't a kid anymore.

654
00:34:23,036 --> 00:34:24,637
You know, this is my life's calling,

655
00:34:24,671 --> 00:34:27,673
and it's just... flushed down the drain.

656
00:34:27,707 --> 00:34:29,708
What the hell's that even mean?

657
00:34:29,743 --> 00:34:30,909
I don't think you understand.

658
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:31,977
My dad was a firefighter...

659
00:34:32,012 --> 00:34:34,013
Your dad lived his life, right?

660
00:34:34,047 --> 00:34:35,981
Now you're living yours.

661
00:34:36,016 --> 00:34:37,449
Hell, I get it.

662
00:34:37,483 --> 00:34:39,652
It's a fine thing to honor
your pops by filling his shoes,

663
00:34:39,686 --> 00:34:43,622
but if those shoes don't fit,

664
00:34:43,657 --> 00:34:46,892
it doesn't mean you have
to go through life barefoot.

665
00:34:50,096 --> 00:34:52,730
Hey, where does Herrmann want this thing?

666
00:34:52,765 --> 00:34:54,633
Uh...

667
00:34:54,667 --> 00:34:57,469
Up here by the door.

668
00:35:01,874 --> 00:35:03,841
Okay.

669
00:35:03,876 --> 00:35:05,477
- I guess we're done here?
- Yeah.

670
00:35:05,511 --> 00:35:08,946
I'll see you later, right?

671
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,648
Yeah, maybe.

672
00:35:10,683 --> 00:35:13,484
Aren't you coming to the fundraiser?

673
00:35:13,518 --> 00:35:15,586
You didn't even want me at the hospital.

674
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,188
That was different.

675
00:35:17,222 --> 00:35:19,223
Really? What's changed?

676
00:35:19,257 --> 00:35:20,892
Well, a few days have passed.

677
00:35:20,926 --> 00:35:22,560
Your drug tests came back clean.

678
00:35:22,594 --> 00:35:25,128
I'm still getting a bunch
of sideways looks, Casey.

679
00:35:25,163 --> 00:35:26,263
I don't want to deal with it.

680
00:35:26,298 --> 00:35:28,899
To hell with them.

681
00:35:28,933 --> 00:35:31,235
We all know you didn't do anything.

682
00:35:31,269 --> 00:35:34,338
Do you know that? 'Cause I don't.

683
00:35:34,372 --> 00:35:36,840
I keep replaying it
over and over in my head.

684
00:35:36,874 --> 00:35:38,275
What color was the light?

685
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,444
Did I check the cross
traffic? But I don't know.

686
00:35:40,478 --> 00:35:43,213
Cruz, listen to me.

687
00:35:43,247 --> 00:35:45,182
Welch thinks you screwed up.

688
00:35:45,216 --> 00:35:46,349
Who cares?

689
00:35:46,383 --> 00:35:47,617
He doesn't know you.

690
00:35:47,651 --> 00:35:49,519
But everybody at 51 does.

691
00:35:49,553 --> 00:35:53,757
None of us have doubted you
for a single second, all right?

692
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:56,159
So don't you dare start doubting yourself.

693
00:36:07,037 --> 00:36:09,572
Thanks, man.

694
00:36:09,607 --> 00:36:12,108
Whoa, $20 cover tonight.

695
00:36:12,142 --> 00:36:13,509
I already paid.

696
00:36:13,544 --> 00:36:15,878
I just stepped out to feed the meter.

697
00:36:15,912 --> 00:36:18,547
- Is that right?
- I already paid!

698
00:36:18,581 --> 00:36:20,049
- Come on...
- Oh.

699
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:22,451
What's up, man? You're good, bro.

700
00:36:22,485 --> 00:36:24,954
- Thank you, man.
- Hey!

701
00:36:27,991 --> 00:36:29,691
Hey, Mouch.

702
00:36:29,726 --> 00:36:30,759
Come here.

703
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,997
I got some bad news for you guys.

704
00:36:36,031 --> 00:36:37,499
Oh, no, what?

705
00:36:42,272 --> 00:36:45,039
Casey and I...

706
00:36:45,074 --> 00:36:46,675
we're splitting up.

707
00:36:46,709 --> 00:36:47,742
What?

708
00:36:47,777 --> 00:36:50,745
Get out of here.

709
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,814
Yeah. But, um,

710
00:36:52,848 --> 00:36:54,215
on the bright side,

711
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:57,318
I'm free to join you on Truck 81.

712
00:36:59,221 --> 00:37:00,321
Yeah-ha-ha!

713
00:37:02,158 --> 00:37:05,058
Yeah!

714
00:37:06,895 --> 00:37:11,499
I know this could be tricky,
but it'll be worth the trouble.

715
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:14,268
You're the best lieutenant I've ever seen.

716
00:37:14,303 --> 00:37:16,069
And you're going to make
me into a better firefighter

717
00:37:16,104 --> 00:37:17,538
more than anyone else could.

718
00:37:17,572 --> 00:37:18,939
Hell, yes, I am.

719
00:37:21,776 --> 00:37:23,643
Hey, to Gabby Dawson.

720
00:37:23,678 --> 00:37:26,546
Welcome to Truck 81, baby!

721
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,185
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

722
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:34,354
Hey, uh, listen up, everybody.

723
00:37:34,388 --> 00:37:36,290
I just got off the phone with Chief Boden,

724
00:37:36,324 --> 00:37:38,391
who's at Chicago Med right now,

725
00:37:38,426 --> 00:37:43,563
and I'm happy to report that Jason Molina

726
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:47,500
is awake and talking with the doctors.

727
00:37:47,535 --> 00:37:50,737
But, um, he's got a long
recovery ahead of him,

728
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:53,405
and his family's counting
on us for the help.

729
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,409
So keep that money coming in, all right?

730
00:37:57,444 --> 00:37:59,545
Yeah!

731
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:23,902
Chief.

732
00:38:23,936 --> 00:38:25,904
We heard Molina was awake.

733
00:38:25,938 --> 00:38:27,305
Got a little something for him.

734
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,806
Yeah, he's up.

735
00:38:28,841 --> 00:38:32,143
And he's come clean.

736
00:38:32,178 --> 00:38:36,047
He says Lieutenant Welch gave him the nod.

737
00:38:36,082 --> 00:38:38,616
A signal Molina understood to mean,

738
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,887
"beat 81 to the scene,
come hell or high water."

739
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:46,457
Molina and Welch are taking
the heat for this one.

740
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:48,259
You're off the hook, Cruz.

741
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:04,141
Casey, while we have Chief Tiberg,

742
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:08,212
do you have an answer on Dawson?

743
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:10,814
Uh, yeah, yeah.

744
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,851
We'd like to have Gabriela
Dawson on Truck 81.

745
00:39:14,886 --> 00:39:16,920
Dawson?

746
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:19,556
I thought there was some reason
you didn't want to do that.

747
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,125
Personal issues. It's resolved now.

748
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:27,263
Great. The spot's hers.

749
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:42,878
Chief. Quick question:

750
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:45,148
If Dawson's moving over to Truck,

751
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:47,583
that means there's an opening
for a paramedic, correct?

752
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:52,187
Correct.

753
00:39:52,221 --> 00:39:53,622
Correct.

754
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:02,565
Molina...

755
00:40:06,535 --> 00:40:08,036
How are you feeling?

756
00:40:08,071 --> 00:40:11,106
I'm hanging in there.

757
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,408
This is Daniela, my wife.

758
00:40:13,443 --> 00:40:18,080
Dani, this is Lieutenant
Casey, of Truck 81.

759
00:40:18,114 --> 00:40:21,483
Welch and I got the two houses together.

760
00:40:21,517 --> 00:40:24,953
Hopefully this is enough to get
you by till Jason's on his feet.

761
00:40:24,987 --> 00:40:27,254
Thank you.

762
00:40:27,289 --> 00:40:30,291
He will be, too. You watch.

763
00:40:39,134 --> 00:40:41,402
Thank you.

764
00:40:41,436 --> 00:40:43,270
We heard about your statement.

765
00:40:43,305 --> 00:40:44,472
Took balls.

766
00:40:44,506 --> 00:40:48,909
Yeah. But we reap what we sow, right?

767
00:40:55,783 --> 00:40:58,385
So they say.

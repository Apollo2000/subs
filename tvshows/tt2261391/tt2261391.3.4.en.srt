1
00:00:01,278 --> 00:00:04,226
Boden and I have been talking
about making you our candidate.

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:05,429
Yeah! Yes!

3
00:00:05,465 --> 00:00:08,716
Welcome to Truck 81, baby!

4
00:00:09,786 --> 00:00:11,685
Mils. Mils! Hey!

5
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:13,437
I can't clear you for Squad duty.

6
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,406
If Dawson's moving over to Truck,

7
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:17,057
it means there's an
opening for a paramedic.

8
00:00:17,093 --> 00:00:18,309
Correct.

9
00:00:18,311 --> 00:00:20,161
I ordered some drinks.
Where are the drinks?

10
00:00:20,196 --> 00:00:21,712
- I think you had enough.
- All of a sudden,

11
00:00:21,747 --> 00:00:23,380
- it's an intervention?
- You do know that there

12
00:00:23,432 --> 00:00:25,766
- is grief counseling available.
- I'm good.

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,587
Ready? Go.

14
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:32,523
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

15
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:37,695
I kicked your ass. I kicked your ass!

16
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,080
Yeah! Thank you, Mick.

17
00:00:40,116 --> 00:00:42,900
Put this down towards a round for everyone.

18
00:00:45,438 --> 00:00:47,421
All right, all right.

19
00:00:49,692 --> 00:00:51,442
Come on, Kelly, you got to take it outside.

20
00:00:51,444 --> 00:00:53,460
What are you talking about?

21
00:00:53,496 --> 00:00:55,980
All the money I put away
here, I can't enjoy one smoke?

22
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:57,815
Take it up with the mayor.

23
00:00:57,867 --> 00:01:00,117
Maybe I will...

24
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:03,070
take it up with the mayor.

25
00:01:05,825 --> 00:01:08,092
You're six Irish car bombs in.

26
00:01:08,094 --> 00:01:12,079
When I buy that ride of
yours, I want it in once piece.

27
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:15,065
You're a real pal, Mick.

28

29
00:01:45,198 --> 00:01:48,432
All right, dinner
options: Greek or Italian?

30
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:51,235
Barely engaged and she's
already trying to lose the ring.

31
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,704
Oh. It's better than
realizing it's stuck on there

32
00:01:53,706 --> 00:01:56,557
- before roll call tomorrow.
- We got tools for that.

33
00:01:56,609 --> 00:01:59,410
Don't even joke.

34
00:01:59,462 --> 00:02:02,396
I already feel like I'm
under the microscope.

35
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:04,448
Because you are, like any candidate

36
00:02:04,483 --> 00:02:05,816
should be on their first day.

37
00:02:05,868 --> 00:02:08,102
- Oh...
- That being said,

38
00:02:08,137 --> 00:02:11,939
you're going to kick ass tomorrow.

39
00:02:11,974 --> 00:02:13,757
Thanks.

40
00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:16,610
But is that my lieutenant,

41
00:02:16,646 --> 00:02:19,496
or fianc×™ talking?

42
00:02:19,548 --> 00:02:22,349
Well, you're my candidate at work,

43
00:02:22,385 --> 00:02:25,019
but at home, I'm all yours.

44
00:02:25,054 --> 00:02:26,787
Hm...

45
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:29,640
Then it wouldn't be insubordination

46
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:32,993
if I were to say...

47
00:02:33,045 --> 00:02:34,662
Thai food.

48
00:02:47,994 --> 00:02:50,961
Oh! Somebody's shooting!

49
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:54,098
Out of the way!

50
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:17,788
Why did you do that?

51
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,792
I told you to stay put!

52
00:03:21,844 --> 00:03:24,295
Sir, you need to go back. Go back now!

53
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:26,180
You ain't going nowhere.

- www.addic7ed.com -

55
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:42,105
Ma'am, just put pressure on it.

56
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,674
- You talk to me, not her!
- Okay.

57
00:03:44,676 --> 00:03:47,877
Relax. You're the man in charge.

58
00:03:47,913 --> 00:03:50,363
It's her own damn fault,

59
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:53,416
trying to stop doing my business!

60
00:03:53,452 --> 00:03:54,551
You did what you came here to do.

61
00:03:54,603 --> 00:03:56,252
Nothing's holding you here.

62
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,704
It ain't that simple!

63
00:03:57,756 --> 00:04:00,040
Boy, why don't you listen to the man?

64
00:04:00,075 --> 00:04:03,326
You don't get it! You
already seen too much!

65
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:24,514
Let me see.

66
00:04:24,516 --> 00:04:27,667
The injury's right below the clavicle.

67
00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:30,770
No exit wound. How's your breathing?

68
00:04:30,822 --> 00:04:33,456
Okay, good.

69
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,625
Put this on. Keep pressure on it.

70
00:04:35,677 --> 00:04:39,195
Forget 911, there's no
reception this far underground.

71
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:41,848
- I got a radio in my cab.
- Hey, hey!

72
00:04:41,883 --> 00:04:43,900
The more you move, the
more you bleed. Okay?

73
00:04:43,952 --> 00:04:46,186
I'll get the radio.

74
00:04:46,221 --> 00:04:48,972
He wasn't alone. The
other one went in the back.

75
00:04:49,007 --> 00:04:51,741
Just keep pressure on it.

76
00:04:51,793 --> 00:04:55,512
Yeah, this is train...

77
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:58,932
2509, we have gunshots
fired. One dead, one wounded.

78
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:01,518
Copy 2509, units are being dispatched.

79
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,902
Stand by.

80
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:04,237
All right. Tell them to hurry up,

81
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:05,472
she's losing a lot of blood.

82
00:05:05,507 --> 00:05:06,439
We need paramedics.

83
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:08,491
Copy that 2509.

84
00:05:08,527 --> 00:05:11,711
Hey, come on! Come on!

85
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,467
Where's the next platform?

86
00:05:17,502 --> 00:05:20,019
Washington Station's the last
one open this time of night.

87
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:23,006
Keep moving! Is there a closer station?

88
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,258
One, but it's off-line, no street access.

89
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,244
All right. You can do
this. Show me, come on.

90
00:05:33,568 --> 00:05:35,502
You can do it, come on.

91
00:05:37,556 --> 00:05:40,306
Right over there.

92
00:05:40,358 --> 00:05:43,960
So why the hell did you
jump in front of a bullet?

93
00:05:43,962 --> 00:05:46,229
These gangs been ruining
lives in my neighborhood

94
00:05:46,281 --> 00:05:48,398
for as long as I can remember.

95
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:50,266
The on to survive is to keep your head down

96
00:05:50,302 --> 00:05:52,051
and pretend it's not happening.

97
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:53,903
I just got tired of pretending.

98
00:05:53,955 --> 00:05:55,338
Yeah.

99
00:05:55,373 --> 00:05:57,006
You're no different.

100
00:05:57,058 --> 00:06:00,026
You ran into my car
like some kind of maniac.

101
00:06:00,078 --> 00:06:02,128
Yeah, well,

102
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,399
you either gotta move
forward or backward, right?

103
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:08,718
The bullet's close to your lung.

104
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,687
We're gonna need to seal
it so no air gets in. Okay?

105
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:13,156
Okay.

106
00:06:13,158 --> 00:06:15,175
You're doing great,
you're doing great. Okay.

107
00:06:15,227 --> 00:06:16,726
Hold that there, put pressure on it.

108
00:06:16,778 --> 00:06:18,194
- I got it.
- You got it? Hold it there.

109
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,662
- Okay?
- Mm-hm.

110
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:21,548
The cops aren't gonna
know to look for us here.

111
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,233
I'm gonna try and make a signal, all right?

112
00:06:23,285 --> 00:06:25,151
- You a doctor?
- No.

113
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:27,854
I'm a firefighter.

114
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,622
Maybe you missed your calling.

115
00:06:29,658 --> 00:06:31,040
My best friend was a paramedic.

116
00:06:31,076 --> 00:06:33,526
She drilled this kind of stuff into me.

117
00:06:33,562 --> 00:06:35,495
Amen to her.

118
00:06:40,535 --> 00:06:42,485
Okay.

119
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:44,721
Okay, there we go.

120
00:06:44,723 --> 00:06:47,640
All right, we just need enough
smoke to trip this alarm.

121
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:49,626
The cops will be here in no time. Okay?

122
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:53,246
Hey! Hey! Come on!

123
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:54,647
Hey, hey! You gotta stay with me!

124
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:57,383
Hey, you gotta stay with me. Okay?

125
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:59,552
Well...

126
00:06:59,604 --> 00:07:01,554
Lookee here.

127
00:07:09,147 --> 00:07:11,114
Finish this, Andre.

128
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,383
Do it.

129
00:07:14,603 --> 00:07:16,419
That ain't gonna help
either one of you, fool.

130
00:07:19,758 --> 00:07:21,874
Come on, man. Do it!

131
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,160
- They ain't G!
- They're witnesses!

132
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:28,197
Andre, you're the one with the gun. Okay?

133
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,832
You can walk away from this still.

134
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:32,986
Stop talking to me!
All right? Stop talking!

135
00:07:45,183 --> 00:07:48,585
Give me that gun! If
you won't do it, I will.

136
00:07:48,637 --> 00:07:51,220
- Get on your knees!
- Drop the gun! Drop the gun!

137
00:07:51,256 --> 00:07:53,189
Drop the gun! Get on your knees!

138
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:55,692
- Drop the gun!
- Let me see your hands!

139
00:07:55,694 --> 00:07:59,045
- Get down!
- I need an ambulance here now!

140
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,632
2113 emergency. Roll an
ambulance to Belmont Station.

141
00:08:02,634 --> 00:08:05,618
We've got a victim with a
gunshot wound to the chest.

142
00:08:14,012 --> 00:08:15,511
Severide.

143
00:08:15,563 --> 00:08:17,780
That fire alarm was good thinking.

144
00:08:17,816 --> 00:08:20,266
Hey. How about we give you a ride home?

145
00:08:20,318 --> 00:08:22,268
No, I'm good. Thanks, I'm...

146
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,070
Actually, we can't let you go yet.

147
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:27,106
Not until Homicide gets your statement.

148
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:42,065
Three months suspension from driving

149
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,333
is like a death sentence.

150
00:08:43,368 --> 00:08:44,701
Who doesn't roll through a light?

151
00:08:44,703 --> 00:08:47,687
Hey, you were cleared of the wreck.

152
00:08:47,722 --> 00:08:49,189
Could have been worse. Huh?

153
00:08:49,241 --> 00:08:51,658
Yeah, says the guy who gets to
drive while I'm in purgatory.

154
00:08:51,693 --> 00:08:55,462
I feel for you, man. Really, I do.

155
00:08:55,497 --> 00:08:59,332
Oh! What do we have here?
This a new candidate?

156
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:01,768
She's all yours, fellas.

157
00:09:01,803 --> 00:09:04,003
Hope you're ready to
finally get your hands dirty.

158
00:09:04,055 --> 00:09:05,688
Oh, absolutely. Just as soon as I drop...

159
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,991
That can wait.

160
00:09:07,993 --> 00:09:11,644
Could you do me a favor
and grab a spanner wrench

161
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,631
from compartment three, would you?

162
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,499
Uh, yeah, okay.

163
00:09:21,006 --> 00:09:22,972
Oh!

164
00:09:25,544 --> 00:09:26,893
Hey, come on, you were supposed to...

165
00:09:26,928 --> 00:09:28,094
What? Scream like a seven-year-old,

166
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,212
like you did on your first shift?

167
00:09:29,247 --> 00:09:30,914
That is not quite what happened.

168
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:32,465
Yeah, it did.

169
00:09:32,517 --> 00:09:33,817
You wanna prank the new girl, you better

170
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:35,068
- come at her with more...
- Is that smack talk

171
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,887
coming from the candidate?

172
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:40,323
Yeah, I do believe it is.

173
00:09:40,358 --> 00:09:43,760
Okay. All right. Let's start over. Okay?

174
00:09:43,762 --> 00:09:46,913
I'm really happy to be
here. And I know that I have

175
00:09:46,948 --> 00:09:50,016
a lot to learn and I do not
expect any special treatment.

176
00:09:50,051 --> 00:09:51,901
Yeah, yeah. What's in the bag?

177
00:09:51,903 --> 00:09:53,937
Oh! Lunch.

178
00:09:53,972 --> 00:09:56,272
It's an old family recipe: arroz con...

179
00:09:56,324 --> 00:09:57,457
Don't let us stop you on your way

180
00:09:57,492 --> 00:10:00,777
to your new work station.

181
00:10:00,812 --> 00:10:02,745
That would be the kitchen.

182
00:10:10,472 --> 00:10:12,939
So your EMT-P license is still valid

183
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:16,643
and medical has cleared your request.

184
00:10:16,678 --> 00:10:19,629
- So I'm good to go then, right?
- Yeah.

185
00:10:19,664 --> 00:10:21,981
Peter.

186
00:10:23,902 --> 00:10:27,053
This choice that you've made,

187
00:10:27,088 --> 00:10:28,021
it's commendable.

188
00:10:28,073 --> 00:10:29,455
But I feel compelled to tell you

189
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:33,426
that other firefighters
have gone down this road,

190
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:35,495
only to find themselves chasing ghosts.

191
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:37,046
Yeah, I know what you're
talking about, Chief.

192
00:10:37,082 --> 00:10:40,483
I know you've always felt that
firefighting is your legacy.

193
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:43,570
What I need right now is a great paramedic.

194
00:10:43,605 --> 00:10:45,755
Then you have one.

195
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,590
I'm here to do the work.

196
00:10:49,995 --> 00:10:51,461
Good.

197
00:10:54,432 --> 00:10:59,302
Chief, did Lieutenant
Severide mention my situation?

198
00:11:00,605 --> 00:11:04,891
He... he said that he
was gonna do what he could

199
00:11:04,926 --> 00:11:07,544
to try and find a way around the situation,

200
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:09,796
keep me on the Squad.

201
00:11:09,831 --> 00:11:12,682
No, he did not.

202
00:11:12,734 --> 00:11:14,284
Sorry, Peter.

203
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:15,952
Kelly Severide doesn't
seem to be in a place

204
00:11:16,004 --> 00:11:17,520
where he can offer much help.

205
00:11:17,556 --> 00:11:21,925
Yeah, of course.

206
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,893
Brett.

207
00:11:27,332 --> 00:11:29,382
- Done deal?
- It's official.

208
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:31,985
- Two of you are now partners.
- Nice!

209
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,704
I've never had a guy before.

210
00:11:34,756 --> 00:11:37,273
Um, in an ambo.

211
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:39,909
I mean, as a partner in an ambo.

212
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:42,345
Mm-hmm. Yeah, we... we got it.

213
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:49,102
Hey.

214
00:11:49,137 --> 00:11:51,904
If crashing here is your way of
skipping out on paying rent...

215
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:56,392
No, I lost my key. I didn't
want to wake you guys up.

216
00:11:56,428 --> 00:12:00,346
How'd you get the shiner?
Hit on the wrong woman?

217
00:12:00,382 --> 00:12:01,948
Something like that.

218
00:12:07,088 --> 00:12:08,972
This looks great.

219
00:12:08,974 --> 00:12:11,407
Hey, the green salsa is for the eggs.

220
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:14,193
Hey. I'm looking for Sylvie Brett.

221
00:12:14,229 --> 00:12:17,447
Who's this?

222
00:12:17,482 --> 00:12:20,083
- Harrison?
- Hey, Sylvie.

223
00:12:21,886 --> 00:12:23,820
- Guys.
- What are you doing here?

224
00:12:23,822 --> 00:12:28,574
Well, truth be told, I came to apologize.

225
00:12:29,744 --> 00:12:31,628
Maybe we should talk about this in private.

226
00:12:31,663 --> 00:12:35,932
Nope. This is as good a place as any.

227
00:12:35,984 --> 00:12:39,002
I blew it. I looked at our coming wedding

228
00:12:39,054 --> 00:12:42,438
and I had doubts about
whether I wanted to marry

229
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,957
the only girl that I ever
loved and I let my cold feet

230
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:48,061
get the best of me.

231
00:12:48,113 --> 00:12:51,831
I'm sorry for that.

232
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:56,285
And I'm sorry I called off the
wedding and I want you back.

233
00:12:56,321 --> 00:12:58,771
Please come home.

234
00:12:58,807 --> 00:13:01,090
Wait.

235
00:13:01,126 --> 00:13:02,775
So, like, in Runaway Bride,

236
00:13:02,827 --> 00:13:05,712
I thought...

237
00:13:05,764 --> 00:13:07,797
- Truck 81, Squad Three...
- Saved by the bells!

238
00:13:07,849 --> 00:13:12,869
- Person in distress.
- I... I have to go.

239
00:13:12,921 --> 00:13:15,888
Hey, Candidate, give 'em hell.

240
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:28,634
So this Harrison, he left you?

241
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:33,489
Um... yeah. I kinda lied about that.

242
00:13:53,228 --> 00:13:55,528
Over here! Over here!

243
00:13:55,563 --> 00:13:57,313
Tom was prepping an SUV for the crusher

244
00:13:57,315 --> 00:13:58,448
when our forklift hit the pile.

245
00:13:58,483 --> 00:14:00,066
Whole thing came crashing down on him.

246
00:14:01,486 --> 00:14:03,953
- Help!
- He's alive!

247
00:14:03,988 --> 00:14:06,322
The Ford is slipping! Hold it!

248
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,479
Please, don't let me die like this.

249
00:14:15,531 --> 00:14:16,580
We're not gonna let that happen.

250
00:14:16,995 --> 00:14:18,378
We need struts and cribbing, right now!

251
00:14:18,413 --> 00:14:20,897
On its way! Let's go!

252
00:14:21,332 --> 00:14:23,466
Herrmann, Dawson reports directly to you.

253
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:24,734
Yeah. Copy that.

254
00:14:24,786 --> 00:14:26,218
All right, have the
bottle jacks standing by.

255
00:14:26,254 --> 00:14:28,304
- You're trained for that, right?
- Yeah, at the academy.

256
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:29,989
Yeah, yeah. Good. Go, get on it.

257
00:14:30,024 --> 00:14:32,108
Watch the front end! Watch it!

258
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,993
Newhouse, I need a strut on this side!

259
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:36,178
Hey, Tom! Tom, hey! Look at me!

260
00:14:36,214 --> 00:14:38,814
We're doing our part, you do
yours and stay awake, okay?

261
00:14:46,841 --> 00:14:49,725
- Mills?
- Yeah?

262
00:14:49,777 --> 00:14:51,744
Oh, yeah, backboard. I got it.

263
00:14:53,965 --> 00:14:54,931
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

264
00:14:58,503 --> 00:15:01,020
- Capp!
- Set!

265
00:15:01,055 --> 00:15:02,221
All right, Casey, cribbing's set.

266
00:15:02,273 --> 00:15:03,906
Let's get this thing lifted. Herrmann!

267
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,925
Where are my jacks?

268
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,812
Jack handles are missing! Not
where they're supposed to...

269
00:15:09,864 --> 00:15:11,280
Come on!

270
00:15:13,818 --> 00:15:15,184
- I got it.
- Capp!

271
00:15:15,219 --> 00:15:18,004
Get that in there!

272
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:20,156
With me, Dawson.

273
00:15:20,191 --> 00:15:22,058
Dawson!

274
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,110
Halligan!

275
00:15:24,162 --> 00:15:25,161
Back up.

276
00:15:31,536 --> 00:15:32,802
Improvise.

277
00:15:32,804 --> 00:15:33,803
Go.

278
00:15:39,577 --> 00:15:43,746
- Dawson, get on the left side.
- Watch his head.

279
00:15:43,798 --> 00:15:44,847
Okay, we're doing this together now.

280
00:15:44,882 --> 00:15:46,899
Ready? Go!

281
00:15:46,951 --> 00:15:50,086
Watch his head, guys.

282
00:15:51,522 --> 00:15:55,224
Stay with me! How we doing?

283
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:56,392
That's it.

284
00:15:56,427 --> 00:15:58,978
- Got it?
- All right, let's board him.

285
00:15:59,013 --> 00:16:01,547
- I'll board him.
- No, I can slide right...

286
00:16:01,582 --> 00:16:03,232
No, it's too unstable.
I'll bring him to you.

287
00:16:03,267 --> 00:16:04,950
All right, he's clear, let's get him out.

288
00:16:06,804 --> 00:16:08,604
Easy, easy.

289
00:16:08,606 --> 00:16:11,240
One, two, three. Go.

290
00:16:30,661 --> 00:16:33,262
I got $20 on it.

291
00:16:33,297 --> 00:16:35,197
I'm in.

292
00:16:35,233 --> 00:16:36,632
What's the bet?

293
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:37,967
Pool on how you got the black eye.

294
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:39,351
We'd ask if you'd want in,

295
00:16:39,404 --> 00:16:41,487
but you probably remember how you got it.

296
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:43,889
You do remember, right?

297
00:16:43,925 --> 00:16:45,908
Good luck with that.

298
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:50,730
Mouch! How's that eye coming?

299
00:16:50,765 --> 00:16:53,365
Doc said I'll be back
on duty by next shift.

300
00:16:53,418 --> 00:16:54,717
You selling Bibles in the meantime?

301
00:16:54,752 --> 00:16:56,435
Actually, it so happens

302
00:16:56,471 --> 00:16:58,788
the CFD code inspector is coming by today

303
00:16:58,823 --> 00:17:02,007
to sign off on our Molly's II permits.

304
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,726
You sure you're ready for an inspection?

305
00:17:03,778 --> 00:17:06,712
No offense, but she's still
looking a little rusty.

306
00:17:06,764 --> 00:17:09,899
I believe that's called patina.

307
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:11,217
We checked the regulations,

308
00:17:11,252 --> 00:17:12,635
we gave the kitchen a good power wash.

309
00:17:12,637 --> 00:17:15,905
She is good to go.

310
00:17:15,957 --> 00:17:19,308
Hey, Lieutenant, can
I see you for a second?

311
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,844
- Yeah.
- Actually, if you don't mind,

312
00:17:21,879 --> 00:17:25,614
Lieutenant, I could use Dawson
to help me off-load the rig.

313
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,851
You got it. Catch me later.

314
00:17:28,886 --> 00:17:30,836
Come on.

315
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:37,526
What you're trying to
do, it's not a good idea.

316
00:17:37,562 --> 00:17:39,028
I'm just trying to apologize for the...

317
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,746
Calling out your mistakes
with the lieutenant

318
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:45,000
is not gonna do you or me any favors.

319
00:17:45,036 --> 00:17:48,420
See, apologies are dangerous
in a game of inches.

320
00:17:50,241 --> 00:17:51,957
Understood.

321
00:17:51,993 --> 00:17:53,959
All right.

322
00:17:58,499 --> 00:17:59,682
Give me a minute.

323
00:17:59,717 --> 00:18:00,883
Sure.

324
00:18:00,935 --> 00:18:02,818
What's up, Chief?

325
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,437
Hey. You haven't chased off
Dawson already, have you?

326
00:18:05,473 --> 00:18:09,425
No. Typical rookie jitters,
but we'll iron 'em out.

327
00:18:09,427 --> 00:18:11,927
I have no doubt.

328
00:18:11,963 --> 00:18:13,729
Chris...

329
00:18:13,731 --> 00:18:16,549
That lieutenant position that
you applied for at House 48...

330
00:18:16,584 --> 00:18:20,169
- Yeah?
- It's been filled. I'm sorry.

331
00:18:20,204 --> 00:18:24,306
Ah! That's the second time
this month I got dinged.

332
00:18:24,308 --> 00:18:25,941
A lot of variables involved.

333
00:18:25,943 --> 00:18:27,877
You'll get the call. Be patient.

334
00:18:27,912 --> 00:18:30,863
I got a lot of practice with patience.

335
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:37,503
Severide. A word in my office.

336
00:18:50,718 --> 00:18:54,286
Got courtesy call from CPD brass.

337
00:18:54,322 --> 00:18:56,088
Turns out one of my lieutenants

338
00:18:56,123 --> 00:18:59,141
saw a lot of action on
the L train last night.

339
00:18:59,143 --> 00:19:01,360
You know what? You should
get in on that black eye pool.

340
00:19:01,412 --> 00:19:05,814
I think they're up to 90 bucks.

341
00:19:05,816 --> 00:19:07,616
I'm fine, Chief. It's handled.

342
00:19:07,668 --> 00:19:10,636
Oh, like you've been handling
things since you got back here?

343
00:19:10,688 --> 00:19:13,189
Dragging into my house
right before roll call,

344
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,916
looking like you got your
ass kicked by a bottle.

345
00:19:15,143 --> 00:19:18,093
Chief, I get the job done, day in, day out.

346
00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:20,429
It is not just about showing up!

347
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,620
Trust me.

348
00:19:27,672 --> 00:19:32,508
I know that losing Shay was hard.

349
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,143
But do you really think that this is how

350
00:19:34,145 --> 00:19:35,611
she would want you to get past it?

351
00:19:35,646 --> 00:19:38,664
Please, don't.

352
00:19:38,699 --> 00:19:41,033
I'm telling you, I'm fine.

353
00:19:41,085 --> 00:19:44,587
Kelly.

354
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:46,589
Get beyond this.

355
00:19:49,977 --> 00:19:51,977
Or there's no place for you in this house.

356
00:20:09,261 --> 00:20:10,960
Oh! Seconds, huh?

357
00:20:10,995 --> 00:20:11,961
I must be doing something right.

358
00:20:11,996 --> 00:20:12,996
It's not for me.

359
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,998
Thought I'd make a plate for Trudy.

360
00:20:15,032 --> 00:20:20,636
Her appetite for all things is insatiable.

361
00:20:20,671 --> 00:20:21,637
Mm-hmm.

362
00:20:21,672 --> 00:20:22,772
Little more.

363
00:20:22,807 --> 00:20:24,908
Cruz, Mouch, there's an inspector

364
00:20:24,942 --> 00:20:29,679
- from headquarters outside.
- Oh! Showtime!

365
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:33,649
Tell you what. Why don't I get in there,

366
00:20:33,684 --> 00:20:35,718
fire up the burners,
cook us up a couple brats,

367
00:20:35,752 --> 00:20:39,054
- show you what she can do.
- That won't be necessary.

368
00:20:39,088 --> 00:20:40,989
Of course, we don't
want to waste your time.

369
00:20:41,024 --> 00:20:43,626
I'm afraid you're too late for that.

370
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,324
- Say what?
- There's no way I can permit this vehicle.

371
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,397
You're missing a wastewater retention tank,

372
00:20:48,452 --> 00:20:50,053
a designated hand washing sink,

373
00:20:50,087 --> 00:20:52,488
even an integrated fire suppression system.

374
00:20:52,522 --> 00:20:54,590
Inspector, we pored over the regulations.

375
00:20:54,624 --> 00:20:57,293
None of those were on the list.

376
00:20:57,328 --> 00:20:58,929
New regs.

377
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,884
The city's cracking
down on rogue operators.

378
00:21:01,918 --> 00:21:04,153
Your best course of action
is to address the violations

379
00:21:04,188 --> 00:21:05,521
and resubmit.

380
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,491
This could cost us, like, 30 grand easy.

381
00:21:08,525 --> 00:21:10,526
Good luck, gentlemen.

382
00:21:21,204 --> 00:21:25,307
I owe you an apology, about my wedding.

383
00:21:25,341 --> 00:21:27,609
Oh, hey, woman to woman?

384
00:21:27,643 --> 00:21:28,450
You gotta do what you gotta do to survive.

385
00:21:28,475 --> 00:21:31,777
- I get it.
- Thanks.

386
00:21:31,781 --> 00:21:33,948
So what are you gonna do, huh?

387
00:21:33,983 --> 00:21:36,651
Well, I have to see him,

388
00:21:36,685 --> 00:21:38,286
because I...

389
00:21:38,321 --> 00:21:39,356
I kinda stole his car.

390
00:21:39,689 --> 00:21:41,990
Stole? As in...

391
00:21:42,025 --> 00:21:43,343
Full-on grand theft auto.

392
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,695
Mine was in the shop and
I needed to get out, so...

393
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:50,098
Wow.

394
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:52,568
Doing a hell of job with
that liner, Candidate.

395
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:53,836
Oh, well, I'm just, you know,

396
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,471
trying to take pride
in my work, Lieutenant.

397
00:21:55,505 --> 00:21:57,239
Mm-hmm.

398
00:21:57,273 --> 00:21:59,442
What did you want to talk about?

399
00:21:59,476 --> 00:22:01,276
Oh, uh...

400
00:22:05,848 --> 00:22:07,782
Well, I just thought it was
important for you to know

401
00:22:07,817 --> 00:22:11,820
that the delay with the
jacks, that was on me.

402
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:17,559
Don't apologize. Just
get it right next time.

403
00:22:17,623 --> 00:22:19,224
You powerwashed, my ass.

404
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:20,225
These new rules are insane.

405
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,727
And to make sure you do,

406
00:22:22,762 --> 00:22:24,896
your truck company will help
you drill on every tool we have

407
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,796
until you get it right. Starting now.

408
00:22:27,274 --> 00:22:30,276
Report to me on her
progress by the end of shift.

409
00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:33,780
Come on! Let's move!

410
00:22:56,069 --> 00:22:58,771
Listen, I'm prepared to put
a 20 into the black eye pool

411
00:22:58,805 --> 00:23:00,873
if you give me a hint.

412
00:23:00,907 --> 00:23:02,908
Not now, Matt.

413
00:23:05,278 --> 00:23:08,313
You know, how you spend
your time off shift,

414
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:10,148
that's your business.

415
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:12,484
But people in this house count on you.

416
00:23:12,518 --> 00:23:14,653
You know what I can count on? Nothing.

417
00:23:14,687 --> 00:23:16,655
No one.

418
00:23:16,689 --> 00:23:18,890
So why don't you and
everyone else in this house

419
00:23:18,924 --> 00:23:21,559
just leave me alone.

420
00:23:21,594 --> 00:23:23,595
Really.

421
00:23:33,993 --> 00:23:35,760
I don't know. Did it
seem like that inspector

422
00:23:35,794 --> 00:23:39,164
really had it out for us?

423
00:23:39,198 --> 00:23:42,768
It's not us, it's me.

424
00:23:43,303 --> 00:23:46,338
I asked around headquarters.
It turns out his boss,

425
00:23:46,372 --> 00:23:50,976
Chief Hale, he has some
sort of vendetta against me.

426
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,312
- What'd you do, Herrmann?
- I don't know!

427
00:23:53,346 --> 00:23:55,213
But I'll bet it's also
why I get passed over

428
00:23:55,248 --> 00:23:57,949
for every lieutenant position in the city.

429
00:23:57,983 --> 00:24:00,952
Okay, well, you're gonna
have to make it right.

430
00:24:00,986 --> 00:24:03,354
- How?
- Apologize.

431
00:24:03,388 --> 00:24:04,489
For what?

432
00:24:04,523 --> 00:24:06,825
Normally, when I cheese somebody off,

433
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:08,993
- I know what I did.
- Okay.

434
00:24:09,027 --> 00:24:12,530
But Mouch and Cruz both sank
their own money into this.

435
00:24:12,565 --> 00:24:14,398
Not to mention Newhouse's 20 percent.

436
00:24:14,433 --> 00:24:18,502
So, hey, if this goes south,

437
00:24:18,536 --> 00:24:20,537
it's on you.

438
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:27,444
Found it while packing up our apartment.

439
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:31,014
Freshman Sadie Hawkins.

440
00:24:31,048 --> 00:24:33,617
Happiest day of high school when you asked.

441
00:24:36,422 --> 00:24:39,123
You have to stop sending me money.

442
00:24:39,158 --> 00:24:41,225
- I can't accept it.
- I'm not going to carry

443
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,162
old debts into my new life.
Once the car is paid for...

444
00:24:44,196 --> 00:24:47,265
I don't care about the car, Sylvie.

445
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:49,300
I care about you.

446
00:24:56,742 --> 00:24:59,778
You know that house on Darlington?

447
00:24:59,812 --> 00:25:03,647
The one you always loved?

448
00:25:03,681 --> 00:25:06,517
I put an offer on it.

449
00:25:06,551 --> 00:25:10,354
A place for us to live, and
be married, and start a family.

450
00:25:10,389 --> 00:25:11,789
Please just come home with me.

451
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,512
I'm starting something here, Harrison.

452
00:25:14,547 --> 00:25:15,813
I like it.

453
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,214
I know you better than anybody,

454
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:20,251
and I know that this place is not for you.

455
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:30,461
A toast to your first shift.

456
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:33,364
Thanks.

457
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,899
To your first day as a firefighter.

458
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:37,934
And yet, I almost got a guy killed

459
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:39,236
and my lieutenant yelled at me.

460
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:43,006
Oh, you think that was yelling?

461
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,576
Go ask Welch at 105 if that was yelling.

462
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,813
So how was your day?

463
00:25:49,847 --> 00:25:53,818
Lieutenant problems.

464
00:25:54,952 --> 00:25:56,119
Severide.

465
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:01,358
How bad is it?

466
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,394
He's slipping away.

467
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:12,669
You, of all people, know what it's
like to lose someone close to you, baby.

468
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:14,704
What pulled you out?

469
00:26:23,814 --> 00:26:26,249
- Hey, Kelly.
- Kendra.

470
00:26:26,283 --> 00:26:28,752
Hey, uh...

471
00:26:28,786 --> 00:26:29,986
I'm looking for a woman.

472
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:32,122
A gunshot victim who
came in night before last.

473
00:26:32,156 --> 00:26:33,389
L train operator?

474
00:26:33,424 --> 00:26:35,158
She was discharged earlier tonight.

475
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,928
Oh, that's good news,
right? She'll be okay?

476
00:26:37,962 --> 00:26:40,029
She got some very good pre-hospital care,

477
00:26:40,063 --> 00:26:41,297
probably saved her life.

478
00:26:44,361 --> 00:26:46,862
I just want you to know

479
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:49,899
we all miss Leslie so much.

480
00:26:54,104 --> 00:26:56,105
Yeah.

481
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:10,186
Hi, may I help you?

482
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,253
Yes, you can.

483
00:27:11,288 --> 00:27:13,155
My name is Christopher Herrmann,

484
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,389
and I'm here to see Chief Hale.

485
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:17,326
Christopher Herrmann. Firehouse 51?

486
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,627
Yeah. How'd you know...

487
00:27:18,661 --> 00:27:20,429
I'm sorry, the chief's in a meeting.

488
00:27:20,463 --> 00:27:23,398
Oh. It's okay, I can wait.

489
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:26,435
It could be a long time.

490
00:27:26,469 --> 00:27:29,671
Like, really long time.

491
00:27:29,706 --> 00:27:32,240
Right.

492
00:27:37,746 --> 00:27:39,547
Would you mind seeing that he gets those?

493
00:27:39,581 --> 00:27:41,582
I'll do what I can.

494
00:27:47,089 --> 00:27:49,424
Man, it's good to be back.

495
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,858
You were here every day.

496
00:27:50,892 --> 00:27:53,261
I checked in periodically.

497
00:27:53,295 --> 00:27:55,729
Yeah, every shift, right before chow.

498
00:27:55,764 --> 00:27:57,932
Okay, breakfast is up.

499
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,901
Fresh eggs, sausages from Bari's.

500
00:27:59,936 --> 00:28:02,303
Hey, Dawson, do us a favor, huh?

501
00:28:02,338 --> 00:28:04,639
Take a seat, relax.

502
00:28:04,674 --> 00:28:07,608
Sit down, Candidate. That's an order.

503
00:28:07,642 --> 00:28:09,643
Okay.

504
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,488
Oh! Yuck.

505
00:28:20,522 --> 00:28:23,791
I totally forgot to brush my teeth.

506
00:28:23,825 --> 00:28:25,826
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah, do that.

507
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:32,066
Christopher, this just came
for you from headquarters.

508
00:28:32,101 --> 00:28:34,969
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Whoa, cigars from HQ?

509
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,537
You're finally getting that promotion!

510
00:28:36,571 --> 00:28:39,239
No! That is not... you know what?

511
00:28:39,273 --> 00:28:41,434
Here. Enjoy 'em, guys.

512
00:28:42,394 --> 00:28:45,663
Okay.

513
00:28:45,697 --> 00:28:47,698
Mmm!

514
00:28:52,371 --> 00:28:54,839
Dawson.

515
00:28:54,873 --> 00:28:57,341
Truck 81 meeting. Have a seat.

516
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:59,376
Okay.

517
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:09,419
Pouch! Damn it!

518
00:29:09,454 --> 00:29:10,988
I forgot to feed the dog.

519
00:29:11,022 --> 00:29:14,391
Oh! For the love of all that's holy!

520
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,227
Oh, my.

521
00:29:17,261 --> 00:29:20,097
So glad I didn't sit down.

522
00:29:20,131 --> 00:29:24,401
Engine 51, Truck 81, Squad Tthree, Ambo 61,

523
00:29:24,435 --> 00:29:26,637
- structure fire.
- You coming or not, rookie?

524
00:29:26,671 --> 00:29:30,507
You only get one first fire!

525
00:29:39,184 --> 00:29:41,485
Battalion 25 to main,
we have a five-story,

526
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,187
boarded-up structure, fully involved.

527
00:29:43,221 --> 00:29:48,425
Brett, Mills, out here now!

528
00:29:48,459 --> 00:29:51,228
Casey, Severide, we're
going to lose this building.

529
00:29:51,262 --> 00:29:54,464
Engine 51, hold back the
fire so the Truck and Squad

530
00:29:54,498 --> 00:29:56,299
- can search the first floor.
- On it.

531
00:29:56,334 --> 00:29:59,036
All right, I want a full primary search,

532
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:01,504
nothing goes unchecked.
Herrmann, you got Dawson.

533
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:04,974
Dawson, stay back, get
yourself a supply line

534
00:30:05,008 --> 00:30:08,010
over to the hydrant before
the engine's reserve runs out.

535
00:30:08,045 --> 00:30:10,046
- Okay?
- Loud and clear.

536
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,384
No, honey, just breathe.

537
00:30:14,418 --> 00:30:15,685
- The others...
- I know.

538
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,019
They're looking for them right now.

539
00:30:17,054 --> 00:30:18,520
The basement...

540
00:30:18,555 --> 00:30:21,490
There are 15 more.

541
00:30:21,524 --> 00:30:23,525
Chief, we got 15 more in the basement.

542
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,528
Squad Three, Truck 81,
redirect to the basement.

543
00:30:26,563 --> 00:30:29,932
We have 15 civilians. 25
to main, new deal, new deal.

544
00:30:29,967 --> 00:30:31,500
We're gonna need an EMS plan two.

545
00:30:31,534 --> 00:30:33,535
Copy that Battalion 25.

546
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:42,778
Chief, hydrant's been vandalized!

547
00:30:42,812 --> 00:30:45,814
Find some water, Dawson.
Before that engine runs dry!

548
00:30:52,155 --> 00:30:53,454
Engine's losing water!

549
00:30:53,488 --> 00:30:56,024
We need that new line!

550
00:30:56,058 --> 00:30:57,224
They're all stripped!

551
00:30:57,259 --> 00:30:59,260
People are dying for a five-dollar part?

552
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:06,133
- We're losing pressure!
- Okay. Water's almost gone.

553
00:31:06,168 --> 00:31:09,069
- Everyone pull out.
- Chief, we're almost there.

554
00:31:09,103 --> 00:31:12,105
Not without water you're not. Pull out now!

555
00:31:14,643 --> 00:31:17,177
Hey!

556
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:20,213
Grab a horseshoe, follow me!

557
00:31:41,035 --> 00:31:43,337
Dawson, where's that water?

558
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,441
I'll make the run, open
it when I call for water.

559
00:31:48,475 --> 00:31:50,476
Okay.

560
00:31:54,415 --> 00:31:57,417
Where's our water?

561
00:32:06,026 --> 00:32:09,795
Reid, send the water!

562
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,698
Here we go!

563
00:32:11,732 --> 00:32:15,468
Truck, Squad, resume search and rescue.

564
00:32:15,502 --> 00:32:17,503
Damn, girl.

565
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:26,078
- Have you found them?
- They're trying, honey.

566
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,180
Yeah.

567
00:32:28,215 --> 00:32:31,317
They're coming out now, alive.

568
00:32:31,352 --> 00:32:32,686
I got her from here. Thank you.

569
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:36,623
Take a seat for me, okay?
Hey, Brett, I need oxygen.

570
00:32:38,892 --> 00:32:41,060
That was a brave thing you did.

571
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:46,666
Sit them down, take her right there, okay?

572
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:50,403
Okay?

573
00:32:50,437 --> 00:32:52,739
The basement door was chained shut.

574
00:32:52,773 --> 00:32:54,940
The first girl must have
squeezed out to warn everyone.

575
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:57,977
- Trafficking?
- I'm thinking sweatshop.

576
00:33:00,547 --> 00:33:03,716
Hey, Herrmann, we need all hands.

577
00:33:03,751 --> 00:33:06,386
Dawson, mask up.

578
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,821
You're coming in.

579
00:33:08,855 --> 00:33:11,623
Keep one hand on the wall at all times.

580
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:13,458
You stay glued to me.
You conserve your air.

581
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:15,494
- You got it?
- Copy.

582
00:33:20,301 --> 00:33:21,768
- Take a seat.
- Damn it.

583
00:33:21,802 --> 00:33:25,537
Come on, girl. You can't do this!

584
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:28,340
One, two, three, four, five...

585
00:33:28,374 --> 00:33:30,676
- Brett.
- Seven, eight.

586
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,877
Come on, breathe! Nine...

587
00:33:31,912 --> 00:33:33,012
Brett, we got more on the way.

588
00:33:33,046 --> 00:33:34,546
The ambulance is almost here!

589
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,749
Just let me...

590
00:33:37,784 --> 00:33:40,385
- Come on, let me...
- Brett.

591
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,821
Brett, come on.

592
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:43,955
Brett.

593
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:47,359
Brett!

594
00:33:48,461 --> 00:33:51,430
Brett, there's more coming out.

595
00:33:51,464 --> 00:33:53,598
I can take her.

596
00:33:53,633 --> 00:33:55,099
She'll take care of you.

597
00:33:55,134 --> 00:33:57,202
Hey, Dawson, let's go! One more trip in!

598
00:33:57,236 --> 00:33:58,236
Okay.

599
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:07,012
Okay. Confirmation just in.

600
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:10,916
Today's fire was a sweatshop operation.

601
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:12,984
We lost one.

602
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:15,486
But 15 others got a chance at a new life.

603
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:19,524
And that is something to be proud of.

604
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:27,432
Also, I think it's worth mentioning

605
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:29,867
that today was our
candidate's very first fire.

606
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:36,473
And, in light of that,
there's an old tradition

607
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:39,910
that I think we should
bring back to 51. Come on.

608
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:41,242
- Lets' go.
- Come on!

609
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:44,716
Now, it used to be

610
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:47,719
that when a rookie excelled
at their first fire,

611
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:49,788
they were given the privilege

612
00:34:49,822 --> 00:34:52,190
of putting the truck to
bed at the end of shift.

613
00:34:52,224 --> 00:34:57,561
So Gabby Dawson...

614
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:01,032
You made us proud today.

615
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:04,068
And I say we give her the honor.

616
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:12,743
All right!

617
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:14,111
I mean, if that's an order?

618
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,714
You bet your ass! Get in there!

619
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:22,603
Come on, girl! What you waiting for?

620
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:36,684
Okay. All right, yeah, you got me good.

621
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:39,253
Bup-bup! Hey! Where you going?

622
00:35:39,287 --> 00:35:43,090
You think this mess is gonna clean itself?

623
00:35:43,124 --> 00:35:45,525
Mwah. You were amazing.

624
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:48,561
Now, get to work.

625
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:02,976
Kelly. Can I talk to you for a second?

626
00:36:21,462 --> 00:36:24,932
You made me listen to you when Hallie died.

627
00:36:24,966 --> 00:36:26,834
Now it's your turn.

628
00:36:33,628 --> 00:36:36,496
I loved Hallie.

629
00:36:36,531 --> 00:36:41,435
I thought we'd be together forever.

630
00:36:41,469 --> 00:36:44,304
I still think I'm gonna
bump into her in a store,

631
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:48,007
or she's gonna call me out
of the blue or something.

632
00:36:51,245 --> 00:36:52,813
Truthfully,

633
00:36:52,848 --> 00:36:56,851
as screwed up as that
is, I love that feeling.

634
00:37:00,821 --> 00:37:03,891
Listen.

635
00:37:03,925 --> 00:37:06,694
This house needs you.

636
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:09,830
And whether you like it or not,

637
00:37:09,864 --> 00:37:11,865
you need this house.

638
00:37:22,643 --> 00:37:25,545
Look, I really want to
make this work, you and me.

639
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:28,014
I thought it was.

640
00:37:28,048 --> 00:37:31,618
This isn't some small town
in Indiana, this is Chicago.

641
00:37:31,652 --> 00:37:32,519
Yeah, no kidding.

642
00:37:32,553 --> 00:37:33,720
You're gonna see things

643
00:37:33,754 --> 00:37:35,255
that you could never imagine,

644
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:38,625
and people in situations that
make you sick to your stomach.

645
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:41,494
Okay? But I need to know
that you're gonna be able

646
00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:43,263
to stay with me through anything.

647
00:37:43,297 --> 00:37:44,497
- I...
- We save who we can.

648
00:37:44,532 --> 00:37:47,334
If you get attached or lose focus,

649
00:37:47,368 --> 00:37:50,370
a rescue becomes a recovery in a blink.

650
00:37:53,774 --> 00:37:56,776
I'm just saying this for
your own good, Sylvie.

651
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,331
You know, usually, when
first watch rolls in,

652
00:38:18,365 --> 00:38:20,567
that's our cue to go home.

653
00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:22,768
Thought I'd pick up a second shift.

654
00:38:25,705 --> 00:38:30,043
Hey, listen.

655
00:38:30,097 --> 00:38:31,831
I'm still working on things,

656
00:38:31,865 --> 00:38:34,266
and I'm sorry if I dropped the ball.

657
00:38:34,301 --> 00:38:37,170
I appreciate what you did,
what you're doing for the house.

658
00:38:37,204 --> 00:38:39,605
I'm glad you're still here.

659
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:40,606
Thanks.

660
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,177
And for now, I'm good where I am.

661
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,120
Sylvie.

662
00:39:10,002 --> 00:39:12,604
Hey. Chief Hale.

663
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:15,441
- My name is Christopher...
- Herrmann.

664
00:39:15,475 --> 00:39:18,143
- I know who you are.
- Listen, hey!

665
00:39:18,177 --> 00:39:19,812
All right, listen, I get it.

666
00:39:19,846 --> 00:39:22,080
All right? You got a beef with me.

667
00:39:22,114 --> 00:39:25,784
Sandbag my career, fine.

668
00:39:25,819 --> 00:39:29,354
But don't take it out on Molly's II.

669
00:39:29,388 --> 00:39:31,722
You're only hurting some
good guys who are trying

670
00:39:31,757 --> 00:39:33,624
to start an honest business.

671
00:39:33,659 --> 00:39:37,395
Look, I don't know what it is
that I did to piss you off...

672
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:40,198
You really don't know?

673
00:39:47,376 --> 00:39:51,413
There's a reason my car
is parked on the street.

674
00:39:57,319 --> 00:39:58,853
Energy water.

675
00:39:58,887 --> 00:40:03,191
Or as you pitched it two
years ago at the CFD picnic,

676
00:40:03,225 --> 00:40:08,029
"it's a guaranteed nest egg."

677
00:40:08,064 --> 00:40:11,332
Oh, boy.

678
00:40:16,237 --> 00:40:18,606
Hey.

679
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,242
Hey.

680
00:40:22,277 --> 00:40:25,012
- How are you feeling?
- I was shot, you know.

681
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:28,115
- It hurts like hell.
- What do you got there?

682
00:40:28,149 --> 00:40:29,551
Just a thank you.

683
00:40:29,585 --> 00:40:33,353
You can pretend they're
fat-free, but they're not.

684
00:40:33,388 --> 00:40:36,657
- I'm glad you're okay.
- Thanks to you.

685
00:40:36,692 --> 00:40:39,694
Nah.

686
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:44,031
I need to meet this
paramedic friend of yours.

687
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:47,068
Uh, she's actually, um...

688
00:40:50,004 --> 00:40:52,839
she's dead.

689
00:40:52,873 --> 00:40:54,874
I'm sorry.

690
00:41:06,393 --> 00:41:09,395
She's here. I can feel her.

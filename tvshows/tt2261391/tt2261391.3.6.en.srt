1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,914
Go on. Go canoodle
with your Lieutenant.

2
00:00:03,915 --> 00:00:05,293
This was my worst fear,
Herrmann,

3
00:00:05,294 --> 00:00:06,672
that you guys
weren't gonna treat me

4
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:07,923
like any other candidate.

5
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:09,173
You insisted on working
under Casey.

6
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,509
Okay, so take me
off of Casey's hands,

7
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,478
and let me shadow you on calls.

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,646
This cat Jim has been playing
a sort of shell game

9
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:17,049
to keep his assets
out of your sister's reach.

10
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:19,351
You can't let him
get away with it.

11
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,220
Shut up and listen, Jim.

12
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:23,389
I'll knock you flat on your ass.

13
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:30,696
You really think
she'd knuckle under that easy?

14
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,264
You're gonna, what,

15
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,233
run a game and then split
with the money?

16
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:35,367
No one's running any game, Matt.

17
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,270
I'm leaving your sister, okay?

18
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:39,505
Now, this can go
one of two ways.

19
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:42,207
We can have
an all-out dog fight in court,

20
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:45,244
or Christie can take
the offer on the table...

21
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:47,646
Two grand a month
for the next four years.

22
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:49,248
What about the house?

23
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,300
It's still on the market.

24
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,351
So you're okay with leaving
your wife and daughter

25
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:55,320
with no home
and not enough to live on.

26
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:56,488
They can keep the apartment.

27
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,790
For the past year,

28
00:00:57,792 --> 00:00:59,625
you've been moving assets
into a shell company

29
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:01,760
owned by your little
piece of ass on the side,

30
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:04,329
Keri Hathaway.

31
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:05,464
What's this?

32
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:10,636
The documents in your hand

33
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:14,073
authorize the transactions
you're talking about.

34
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:16,775
You'll note Christie
cosigned every one.

35
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:22,381
You're welcome
to take those with you.

36
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,353
You're not gonna
fleece my sister.

37
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:29,721
All right?

38
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:33,258
Not without getting bloody.

39
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,232
Can I add to my pass line bet?

40
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:41,467
No, you have
to back it up first.

41
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:42,634
Can I press the six?

42
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:43,769
You don't have any money
on the six yet.

43
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,137
Okay, start over.

44
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:46,305
There's no starting over
in craps, Capp.

45
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:47,406
Come on, you're
scaring me here, bud.

46
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:48,807
How about I just bet
what you bet?

47
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:51,143
Hey, it's not funny.

48
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:51,840
You should be going with us.

49
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:53,439
Look, I have a kid.

50
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,039
I can't abandon her
to roll with you degenerates.

51
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,040
Fair enough.

52
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,179
Tony, that's a real excuse.

53
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,309
What?

54
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,980
My sinuses can't take
the dry heat.

55
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,319
- Hey.
- Hey, how'd it go?

56
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,320
Not so good.

57
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,320
- Newhouse?
- Yeah.

58
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,789
- You got a sec?
- Uh, yeah.

59
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,760
Excuse me.
Sorry.

60
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,229
Know any divorce attorneys?

61
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,460
- Heavy-hitter types?
- Oh, yeah.

62
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,399
Use my name.
Bankhead will take care of you.

63
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,639
All right.
Thanks.

64
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,369
- Hey, man.
- Hey, roll out after shift,

65
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,869
handle that thing we discussed?

66
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,370
Yeah, you never told me
what the job was, though.

67
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,280
It's a little lookout thing,
man.

68
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,679
We'll talk about it on the way.

69
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,849
But anything special I need to br...
Nope.

70
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,850
Cool.

71
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,050
Truck 81, ambulance 61, squad 3.

Help!

75
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,330
I can't hold on!

76
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,309
Help!
Please, God, help us!

77
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,810
It's falling!

78
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,240
I can't hold on!
I can't hold him!

79
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,099
That railing
could give out any second.

80
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,599
Mother won't be able
to hold it for long.

81
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,140
Jump bag?

82
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:12,519
Won't survive that fall
with that thing around his neck.

83
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,919
Boden's tied up
on an accident investigation.

84
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,359
You take a man.

85
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,789
We'll throw the aerial.
You fly up it.

86
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,529
Cruz, Otis, go.

87
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,199
Herrmann, Dawson, stairs.

88
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,499
Prep for a forced entry.

89
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,930
Dawson, on his hip
means on his hip,

90
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,039
not ahead of him.

91
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,100
Understood.

92
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,310
Let's go!
Move it, candidate!

93
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,319

94
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,959
I can't hold...

95
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,190
- I can't hold him!
- Hang in there!

96
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,990
Archie, no.

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,299
Help us!

98
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,129
Help!

99
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,100
It's falling.
He's falling!

100
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,540
He's fa...

Gianluca Belfiglio

103
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,809
- Oh, God!
- I got you.

104
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,710
I got it.

105
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,680
Casey, Herrmann!

106
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,860
Dawson, hang back.

107
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,570
Hey...
Herrmann.

108
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:35,699
Ow.

109
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,800
Be careful of his neck.

110
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,009
- Ow!
- Hey, buddy, buddy,

111
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,539
hang on, okay?
Hey, stop moving.

112
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,279
I don't want you
to hurt your neck, okay, bud?

113
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,610
- Herrmann, watch his neck.
- Archie, please!

114
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,789
Easy, easy, easy.
We straighten it all the way,

115
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,719
we could break the kid's neck.

116
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,659
Oh, God, oh, God.

117
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,899
Hey... you got a
favorite animal, Archie?

118
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,929
Snakes.

119
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,499
Snakes?

120
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,569
What do you like better,
anacondas or pythons?

121
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,899
Anacondas.

122
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,569
Yeah, I'm an anaconda man,
myself.

123
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,839
Let's tie this off
with some webbing.

124
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,480
Yeah.

125
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,450
What about you, mom?

126
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,559
God, no,
I'm terrified of snakes.

127
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,020
Take it.

128
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,689
Find an anchor point
and tie it off.

129
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,759
Right.

130
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,000
Newhouse, sawzall!

131
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,700
Hey, give me the sledge.

132
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,550
Secure!

133
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,029
The Arc Air torch
is on its way up, depending.

134
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,390
Hey, Archie...

135
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,099
what are you in, kindergarten?

136
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,499
Mm-hmm.
I need you to be brave

137
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,599
and stay calm, okay?

138
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,369
You can do that for me, right?

139
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,700
Mm-hmm.

140
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,709
Ma'am, I need you to stand back.

141
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,109
No, no, wait, wait, wait.

142
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,739
No, no, no!

143
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,740
Hey, bud, stay calm.

144
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,750
Easy, easy, easy.

145
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,119
Okay, listen, this is gonna be
really loud, okay?

146
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,719
So I want you
to cover your ears.

147
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,919
Can you do that for me?

148
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,489
Be brave.
You're doing great.

149
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,760
- Case, you ready?
- Yeah.

150
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,700
We got him.

151
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,440
Come on.

152
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,079
Baby. Archie!

153
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,880
Come on.

154
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,690
Okay, little buddy.

155
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,690
You all right?

156
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,460
So, Archie... guess
which one of us

157
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,599
raised a family of corn snakes
when she was a kid.

158
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,169
- You?
- You got it.

159
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,169
All right, lean forward
for me, buddy.

160
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,039
The dad was called Gus,

161
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,740
and the mom,
her name was Toothpaste.

162
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,809
You can turn your head
for me, sweetheart?

163
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,749
Okay.

164
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,749
I'll tell you all about how
Gus and Toothpaste had babies

165
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,489
on the way back.
What do you say?

166
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:40,550
Mm-hmm.

167
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,689
Thank you.
Good Lord.

168
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,959
Did my hair turn gray?

169
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,759
No, you were great.

170
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,760
Look, there's no reason
to take Archie to the hospital.

171
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,699
I mean, clearly there's
nothing wrong with him.

172
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,699
Well, it's up to the
paramedics to make that call,

173
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,469
but it's
standard procedure to...

174
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,539
But, I mean, in his case,
he doesn't have to, right?

175
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,609
I mean, he's fine.

176
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,680
Like I said, it's not my call.

177
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,419
He's perfectly fine.
Aren't you, Archie?

178
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,580
Yeah.

179
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,019
Ma'am, given that he's a minor,

180
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,389
I'm making the call to transport
your son to the hospital.

181
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,689
Now, you're welcome
to ride with us if you like.

182
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,430
Fine. I...

183
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,369
Can I have a word?

184
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,469
Sure. What's up, candidate?

185
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,539
I trained on sledge
at the academy.

186
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,769
You didn't have to yank it
out of my hands.

187
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,569
You a baseball fan, Dawson?

188
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,639
- Kind of.
- Yeah?

189
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,040
The academy, that's like T-ball.

190
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,379
This... This is the bigs.

191
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,450
Stick with me, I'll school ya.

192
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,059
- Your partner?
- He's restocking the ambo,

193
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,520
but I was the primary.

194
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,089
What I'm getting at
is whether you detected

195
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,990
any indications
of physical abuse.

196
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,359
Abuse? No.

197
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,460
- I mean... no.
- The reason I ask

198
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,469
is because his file is flagged.

199
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,869
Three years ago,
child protective services

200
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,539
took him away from his mother

201
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,900
on suspicion of abuse
and neglect.

202
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,539
What are you doing?
No, no, no.

203
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,570
No, no, no, please.
Please don't take him.

204
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,609
Please... wait!
Please don't take him, no!

205
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,679
Mommy!
Mommy!

206
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,680
Archie!

207
00:09:12,681 --> 00:09:13,849
Please don't do this.

208
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,579
Please.

209
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,779
Please!

210
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,980
- Oh, my God.
- Mommy, stop them!

211
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,719
- Oh, my God.
- Why are they taking me?

212
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,420
- Oh, my God!
- Mommy, help me!

213
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,470
Gabby?

214
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,039
- Hey.
- Hey.

215
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,409
I can't make it.

216
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,509
What? Why?

217
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,739
Herrmann asked me to stay late.

218
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,809
He wants me to set up
a practice station

219
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,479
for the sledge.

220
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
Yeah.

221
00:09:46,481 --> 00:09:47,649
Remember, it's Herrmann.

222
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,849
He likes to go overboard.

223
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,119
It's gonna be fine.

224
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
Christie will be bummed.

225
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,120
She was hoping you'd be there.

226
00:09:52,121 --> 00:09:53,550
I know, but...

227
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,489
on his hip means on his hip,
Dawson.

228
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,920
Fair point, candidate.

229
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,630
See you at home, Lieutenant.

230
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,129
We appreciate you
taking the time to see us,

231
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,069
especially on such short notice.

232
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,499
Anything for Newhouse.

233
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,600
Thanks.

234
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,109
So, as I explained on the phone,

235
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,079
my sister didn't know
exactly what she was signing.

236
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,079
Jim kept her in the dark
on most financial matters.

237
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,609
Forgive me for being abrupt,

238
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,610
but I spoke
with opposing counsel,

239
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,080
and bottom line is,
I'd be happy to represent you.

240
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:27,050
I think you've got
an imminently winnable case.

241
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,759
That's great to hear.

242
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,059
Clearly, there's more money
than your husband lets on.

243
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,189
No question.

244
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,190
All right.
Where do we go from here?

245
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,859
First, we file
a preliminary injunction

246
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,429
to keep him from moving
any more assets,

247
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,099
and then we hire
a forensic accountant.

248
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,869
That sounds expensive.

249
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,539
I use the best firm in Chicago,

250
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,850
so it won't be cheap.

251
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,169
But I'll take your case
on contingency,

252
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,109
so it's not gonna cost you
a penny up front.

253
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,509
Now, I need you to understand,
however,

254
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,029
what you're about to get into.

255
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,549
What starts out
as a financial battle

256
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,510
often ends up
as an all-out custody war.

257
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,449
It's not gonna be easy
on anybody, least of all you.

258
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,719
Odds are, we can recover
50%, 60% of the assets,

259
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,119
or you can take
the deal they've offered.

260
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,090
That's up to you.

261
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,929
You have to fight this,
Christie.

262
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,099
You can't let Jim
get away with it.

263
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,919
I don't know, Matt.

264
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,730
This has already gone way beyond
what I was prepared for.

265
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,969
I'll be there with you
every step of the way,

266
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,069
whatever you and Violet need.

267
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,970
I promise.

268
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,210
I need time to think.

269
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,679
Okay?

270
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,849
Thank you very much.

271
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,520
Mm-hmm.

272
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,650
- Thanks.
- Take care.

273
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,530
So... where we going?

274
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,669
Nowhere.

275
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,839
We're here.

276
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,839
- You ever work on cars at all?
- Me? No.

277
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,570
It doesn't matter, all right?

278
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,919
Just act like you're
checking on the engine.

279
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,269
Main thing is,
you keep it running,

280
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,609
and if anybody comes,
you call me, all right?

281
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:59,610
Okay, no prob...

282
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,320
Go, go, go!

283
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,190
Go!

284
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,130
All I'm gonna say
is that that was... insane.

285
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,699
Yeah, well,
there's nothing like a divorce

286
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,740
to make a man act crazy.

287
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,309
They met at the dog park.

288
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,849
Toby.

289
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,249
My sweet little baby boy.

290
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,229
How did he take it?

291
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,219
I got the impression he'd
prefer the dog stay with him.

292
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,220
Idiot.

293
00:13:13,221 --> 00:13:14,589
It's my dog.

294
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,059
Personal checks okay?

295
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,689
As long as it doesn't bounce.

296
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,360
Make it out to
recovery services, limited.

297
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,350
Morning.

298
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,109
Mastering the tools
of ignorance, I see.

299
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,339
Trying to,
practicing forcible entry.

300
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,380
Allow me.

301
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,149
Your average lock is
approximately waist-high.

302
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,619
Top hand is for control.
The bottom's your fulcrum.

303
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,190
You start full wide.

304
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,259
You finish...
tight together.

305
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,159
- Got it?
- Was I not doing that?

306
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,129
The art is in the details,
Dawson.

307
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,400
Watch.

308
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,099
You see?

309
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,969
Right.

310
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,200
All right.

311
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,240
- What's up?
- Herrmann is driving me crazy.

312
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,250
I warned you.

313
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,779
I appreciate what he's doing,

314
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,349
but I don't think
that he understands

315
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,049
that I've already attended
the fire academy.

316
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,189
Correct me if I'm wrong, but...

317
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,419
the whole idea
was to put a little separation

318
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,120
between you and me at work,
right?

319
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,239
Yeah, I know.

320
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,359
So if you've got
an issue with Herrmann,

321
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,799
just...
take it up with him.

322
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,230
Okay.

323
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,009
What is this,
the Gabriela Dawson

324
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,350
anger management program?

325
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,280
That is a "yes."

326
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,019
I got a fiance I can't marry...

327
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,689
and a mentor who's
treating me like a child.

328
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,059
You want to talk about it?

329
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,330
No, I'm good.

330
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,330
Seven.

331
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,799
All right, well,
at least you're getting it

332
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,869
out of your system
before we hit Vegas.

333
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,869
Tony, you're up.
Clear the table.

334
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,970
- Maybe I...
- Hey, don't... don't...

335
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,440
even think about bailing on me.

336
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,209
No way, dude, I'm in.

337
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,449
All right, you better be.

338
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,879
That's good luck.

339
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,150
Here. Do it again.

340
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,919
Be back in a second.

341
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,959
Can I please talk to you,
just for two minutes?

342
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,289
Yeah, of course.

343
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,729
Look, I'm really sorry
to bother you.

344
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,890
I know that you're very busy,
but I don't...

345
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,830
I don't know where else to go.

346
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,300
Um...

347
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,870
I got married when I was 19,
because I was pregnant.

348
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,509
And by the time I realized that
he was an abusive alcoholic,

349
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,249
it was too late.

350
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,879
Oh, and I drank too.

351
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,019
I'm... I'm not gonna
lie about it.

352
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,789
We're not here to judge you.

353
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:02,259
After they took Archie,
I got clean right away.

354
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,759
I filed a restraining order
against my ex.

355
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,059
I proved myself to the State,

356
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,959
and I won back
custody of my son.

357
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,269
So... please, if there's...

358
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:15,139
if there's any way that you
could put in a word for me...

359
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,139
Ma'am, it's not our job
to follow up

360
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,910
once a call is over.

361
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:32,989
Wait, ho... hold on.

362
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,789
Shouldn't we go after her?

363
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,859
She just lost her kid.

364
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,029
Look, we all get invested,

365
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:43,260
but there's a line
you can't cross, okay?

366
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,530
Don't get involved.

367
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,569
Ambulance 61.

368
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,470
Man down from unknown causes,

369
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,180
612 Rex Drive.

370
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,520
Fire department, anyone call
for the paramedics?

371
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:13,159
Thank God
you guys are here, man.

372
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,960
The guy in the back,
he looks really hurt, so...

373
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,559
It's really, really bad.
He's right back here, man.

374
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,980
Okay, I need you to sit down
and stop moving, sir.

375
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,989
61 to main.
We're gonna need

376
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,289
- a second ambulance.
- Copy that, 61.

377
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,259
Carter's not gonna die, is he?

378
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,629
Tell me Carter's not gonna die.

379
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,990
I need you to take a seat,
okay, come on.

380
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,259
He's not breathing.

381
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,060
He's got a pulse,
but it's pretty slow.

382
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,329
That sounds bad.

383
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,599
Look, man, I didn't
mean to kill him.

384
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,069
He said I was out of
tune, and I swear...

385
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,439
I swear I wasn't, man.

386
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,969
Hey, hey, buddy.

387
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,270
I'm gonna check you out,
make sure everything's...

388
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,279
Don't touch me, man!
Don't touch me!

389
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,579
Okay, just take a seat.
Calm down, okay?

390
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,579
We need to intubate him
before he goes into

391
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,449
- full cardiac arrest.
- Go ahead, go.

392
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,150
Oh, man.

393
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,359
Whoa, daddy.

394
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,560
What do we got?

395
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,480
Did you shove this
down his throat?

396
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:42,049
Hey, buddy, come on.
Come on.

397
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,580
Bastard tried to kill me
with a corndog!

398
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,919
What do we have this time?

399
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,220
Band practice.

400
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,100
That's good.

401
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,699
- Yeah!
- There you go.

402
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,899
Now what do I do?

403
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,099
How much are you
gonna back it up with?

404
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,339
50 bucks?

405
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,709
There we go.
We're getting there, Capp.

406
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,710
We're getting there, brother.

407
00:19:06,711 --> 00:19:07,970
We are gonna clean up.

408
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,180
Can I talk to you?

409
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,649
I'll take a break.

410
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,049
That sucks.

411
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,479
What do you mean,
don't get involved?

412
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,049
It's not like they
stop being people

413
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,150
when the call ends.

414
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,089
Shay got overly invested
with someone she met on a call.

415
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,029
Guy ends up
blowing his brains out.

416
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,660
You never know
what's really going on.

417
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,030
Well... I just
treated a meth head

418
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,069
with a tuning fork
stuck in his eye,

419
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,109
and even that guy stepped up
and called 911

420
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,470
to save his buddy.

421
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,179
You quit giving somebody
a second chance,

422
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,610
they stop having one.

423
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,620
I need your help on this.

424
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:02,729
You mind if we come in?

425
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,199
Sure.

426
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,330
Just want to ask you
a few questions.

427
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,240
About what?

428
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,170
What was Archie doing
on the balcony alone?

429
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:21,079
He was spying
on the apartment below ours.

430
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,279
Why didn't you just say that?

431
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,580
You have kids?

432
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,419
Mm-mm.

433
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,389
My mom used to take my brother
and me to the bar with her.

434
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,759
O'Henry's.
When she'd get liquored up,

435
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,090
she'd shame us
in front of whoever was there.

436
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,199
I swore I would never
let that happen to my kid,

437
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,229
not ever.

438
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,130
You've been sober
for a while, right?

439
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,169
Two years, three months.

440
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,810
Do you have a chip,
by any chance?

441
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,549
And your sponsor,

442
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,179
when was the last time
you spoke to him?

443
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,820
It's a woman.

444
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,160
15 minutes ago.

445
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,229
You mentioned a restraining
order against your ex.

446
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,230
Yeah.

447
00:21:10,231 --> 00:21:13,230
You got a copy?

448
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,210
You mind if I take a look
in your fridge?

449
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,220
Go on.

450
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,230
They're organic.

451
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,869
I feed Archie right,
which isn't easy to do

452
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,670
on eleven bucks an hour
at a nail salon.

453
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,810
You have any other questions?

454
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,379
Thank you.

455
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,720
We just needed to know
who we were going to bat for.

456
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,290
Let's go!

457
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,699
Go!

458
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,529
One way is life.
The other way is death.

459
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,699
Make a decision.

460
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,400
Make a decision!

461
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,439
Get down, lower down!

462
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,209
Let's go!
Get down lower!

463
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:31,209
Flashin' over!
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

464
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,879
All right.
Listen, you're badly burned,

465
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,719
- but you're probably still alive.
- I know.

466
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,719
You spent too much time
reading the coupling.

467
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,849
Give me your hand.

468
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,919
Smooth butt, that's the female.

469
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,620
That's the way I'm gonna go.

470
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,859
Flip it around.

471
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,690
Big notch...

472
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,860
Uh-uh, Christopher Herrmann
don't go that way.

473
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,399
Get it?

474
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,830
Permission to speak?

475
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,640
Permission granted.

476
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,369
I know I asked for this,

477
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,909
and I know you're
just trying to help,

478
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,209
- but I already did all this...
- This isn't the academy,

479
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:04,709
Dawson.
What you're doing here, now,

480
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,779
this is the Christopher Herrmann
school of firefighting,

481
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,849
learned from a lifetime
on the job.

482
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:11,849
I appreciate that, and I will
do whatever you say, Herrmann.

483
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,519
All I'm asking is that
when we're on calls,

484
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,520
you let me do my job.

485
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,829
All right.

486
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,859
I will.

487
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,229
Thank you.

488
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,199
Hey, where do you
think you're going?

489
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,630
You're not done.

490
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,939
You got to finish
these drills, candidate.

491
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,269
Helmet on.
Let's go.

492
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,610
We don't stop
till we can't get it wrong.

493
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,640
Hey.
You guys okay?

494
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,749
- Hi, uncle Matt.
- Sorry to bother you.

495
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,479
You're not.
What's going on?

496
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,880
I'm on my way
to take the teachers' test,

497
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,519
you know, to get recertified,

498
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,889
and I couldn't get a sitter.

499
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,750
Is there any way
I could drop off Violet

500
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,620
for, like, a hour, two, tops?

501
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,229
Yeah, of course.

502
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,259
- Want to say hi to Pouch?
- Sure.

503
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,929
All right, I'll meet you inside.

504
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,899
So... what do you want me to do
about Bankhead?

505
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,969
- The divorce attorney?
- Yeah.

506
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,839
I'm not doing that, Matt.

507
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,340
I'm gonna take
the settlement offer.

508
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,840
All right.

509
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,779
Good luck on the test.

510
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,880
Thanks.

511
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:23,959
We miss you,
Violet! We miss you!

512
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,729
What are you watching?

513
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:29,800
My friends at the Latin school
sent me a vine.

514
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:32,930
Hey...

515
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,600
you okay?

516
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:44,940
I miss my house...
and my school.

517
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,410
I don't know why my dad's
doing this to us.

518
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,749
I don't know what I did.

519
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,949
Hey, hey.

520
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:53,950
It's not your fault.

521
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,960
It's gonna be okay.

522
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,030
I promised.

523
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,840
I'll be right back.

524
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,479
- What?
- I need more information.

525
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,849
There's got to be
something else.

526
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,379
On your brother-in-law?

527
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,949
I thought Ruzek gave you
what you needed.

528
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:28,019
Not him, the mistress.

529
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,859
You dig deep enough,

530
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,829
sooner or later,
you are gonna find a body.

531
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,090
Then what?

532
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,960
Just do whatever it takes.

533
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,800
Okay.

534
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,480
Hi, there.

535
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,119
What's this, a fire drill?

536
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,689
Kelly Severide.
I'm a Lieutenant with Squad 3.

537
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,519
This is Silvie Brett, paramedic.

538
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,959
We appreciate you taking
a moment out of your busy day.

539
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,459
Yeah, what can I do for you?

540
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,029
Reason we're here is,
a mistake was made,

541
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,529
and because of that, a mother
and son have been split up.

542
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,429
- What's the name?
- Keating.

543
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:14,899
The mother's name is Katharyn.
Her son is Archie.

544
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,439
Ugh, I inherited 26 new files

545
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,609
since Moira
went on maternity leave.

546
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,939
Keating, Keating...

547
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,579
Is that with an "a"
or a couple of "e"s?

548
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,609
E - A.

549
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,779
Got it.

550
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,449
As firefighters,
your word carries

551
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,049
a lot of weight around here,
a lot of weight.

552
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:33,519
Rest assured I'll get to it
as soon as I get a minute.

553
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,489
Okay, well...

554
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:38,059
there's a number on here
when you do.

555
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,059
- It's important.
- Every single one of them's

556
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:43,599
important, especially the guy
whose name's on the folder.

557
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,770
Well, I look forward
to your call.

558
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,799
For real?

559
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,789
Mad men and fools
are in the game for thrills.

560
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:09,559
But wise men,
we're all about the money.

561
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,720
Yo.

562
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,889
You got my number,
any time you need me.

563
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:16,659
What exactly
are the requirements

564
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,699
for participating
in such a venture?

565
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,999
I can't use anybody
with an eye issue.

566
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,799
Well, I'm available.

567
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,769
So consider me
in the on-deck circle.

568
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,539
I've made a full recovery.

569
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,109
Clean bill of health.

570
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,940
Well, I will keep
you all in mind.

571
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,510
Yep.

572
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,719
Curls suit you, girl.

573
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,650
Oh, this is
my wash-and-wear hair.

574
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,919
Didn't have time
to straighten it this morning.

575
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,659
Well, it looks good.

576
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,690
Stop.

577
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,929
Okay, a fax come in for me?

578
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:50,930
Alabama PD?

579
00:27:50,931 --> 00:27:53,030
Um, let's see.

580
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,239
What's up?

581
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,710
I got something for you.

582
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,929
We need to talk.

583
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,830
If you'll excuse me.

584
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:29,239
Anything you have to say
can be directed to my attorney.

585
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,639
Four years ago...
your little mistress

586
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,539
married a man
from Montgomery, Alabama,

587
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,979
faked his will.

588
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:42,519
When the kids sued, she split.

589
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,049
That's a bench warrant
for her arrest.

590
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,690
You're welcome
to keep that copy.

591
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,659
I drop a dime, she's gone.

592
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,259
And given that your assets
are in her name,

593
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:59,599
the money's gone too.

594
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,230
I'm sure you'll do
what's right...

595
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,740
for your daughter.

596
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,940
Truck 81, ambulance 61,
assist the police.

597
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,210
5737 Chase Avenue.

598
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,050
Hold it there.

599
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,659
CPD executing a search warrant,

600
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,820
may need some help
with a forcible entry.

601
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,659
Hey, Sergeant Conroy.

602
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,129
Thanks for coming, Chief.

603
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,590
Wallace Boden,
how can I help you, Sergeant?

604
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,960
Well, we got a known drug dealer

605
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,199
with an outstanding warrant
holed up inside,

606
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,149
and he may be armed,
so I need you

607
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,099
to keep your guys back
until we get the area secure.

608
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,169
Once it's safe, we could use
some help getting in.

609
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,009
- Window or door?
- There's a second-story window

610
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,579
in the back that might work,

611
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,709
but we'd prefer to make entry
through the front.

612
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,179
Thing is,
it's heavily fortified.

613
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,899
Steel security door?

614
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,619
Yeah, with a heavy-graded
steel entry door behind it.

615
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,749
We'll take two guys
and a ladder to the rear.

616
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,019
- You take the entry.
- You got it.

617
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,619
Otis, Mouch...

618
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,659
grab the 20-foot ladder
and go with the Chief.

619
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,020
Cruz, get a chain ready.

620
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,189
Herrmann and Dawson,
grab a set of irons

621
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,160
and have a jack plate
standing by.

622
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,950
Okay, Cruz, take out the slack.

623
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,060
Go for it.

624
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:40,730
- Herrmann, Dawson, go.
- All right, let's go!

625
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,369
All right.

626
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:44,939
Just like the sledge.

627
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,239
Strike.

628
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,309
Strike!

629
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,740
Good.

630
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,379
All right.
One more time.

631
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,649
Strike, strike, strike!

632
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:01,150
Strike!

633
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:12,579
Shots fired, shots fired!

634
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,730
Be advised, we've got
multiple gunshots fired...

635
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,140
Put the gun down!

636
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,840
Copy that... Rolling
additional units to your location.

637
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,450
Dawson... Now!

638
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,720
Go, go, go, go, go!

639
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,829
Police!
Search warrant!

640
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:43,160
- Down on the ground!
- Nobody move!

641
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,939
Clear!

642
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,770
Clear up!

643
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,479
Any of you guys paramedics?

644
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,979
We got a wounded hostage
in here.

645
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,119
Mills, need a backboard.

646
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,049
Hey.
Hey, hey.

647
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,419
We got you.
You're in good hands.

648
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,390
Help me out
and hang in there, okay?

649
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,190
I think it hit her lungs.
She's starting to bleed out.

650
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,730
Thanks.
I got her, Dawson.

651
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,900
Here, I got it.

652
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:28,870
Okay.

653
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,379
Did you see that cut,
Lieutenant?

654
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,849
Damn straight, I saw it.

655
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:34,850
Boom!

656
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,350
Gunshot to the chest.
Pressure, 80 palp.

657
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,019
- 02 stats in the 70s.
- Get her into Trauma 1.

658
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,360
Call CT,
and somebody get respiratory.

659
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,509
She didn't make it?

660
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,780
No.

661
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,219
It was such a good save
for Dawson.

662
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,019
I just... really wanted her
to make it.

663
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,419
You got her here alive.
That's the job.

664
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,089
Doesn't really count, though,
does it?

665
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:19,530
You did everything you could,
all right?

666
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,500
I need to make a stop
on the way back.

667
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,900
Okay.

668
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,479
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it.

669
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,010
We both work for the city,
so can I toss you a bone?

670
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,079
Because this is personal
for you.

671
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,319
Personal for me?

672
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,149
No, no, no, this is personal

673
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,450
for a little boy and his mom
who've been put through hell

674
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,259
because the system, meaning you,

675
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:54,390
is too jammed up
to give a damn about them.

676
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,529
You have the power
to make a difference,

677
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:59,099
and you are going
to make that difference

678
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,199
by taking their folder
off the bottom of your pile

679
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,269
and putting it on top.

680
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,310
And I'm not leaving
until you do.

681
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,510
Yeah.

682
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:25,560
This will last me at least...
five hours.

683
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,449
Hey!

684
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:49,510
You ready?

685
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,349
Don't say it.

686
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:53,389
Don't even say it.

687
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:54,419
You're gonna kill me.

688
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,459
I knew you were gonna do this.

689
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,589
I promised my mom.

690
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,520
She's having
a blow-out garage sale.

691
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,360
I don't want to hear about it.

692
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,360
I can't make Vegas.

693
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,360
Seriously, Capp.

694
00:35:02,361 --> 00:35:04,030
I don't want to hear about it.

695
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:11,339
Lieutenant Severide... Hey.

696
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,269
They're bringing Archie
back home this afternoon.

697
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:15,539
I don't even know how to begin
to say thank you.

698
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,409
Well...

699
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,580
she's the one
who deserves the credit.

700
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,280
Thank you.

701
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,290
Oh... wow.

702
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:31,590
Thank you.

703
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,699
Huh.

704
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:41,099
Hey... Do you want to
go to Vegas with me?

705
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,939
When?

706
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,409
Seriously, right now.

707
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:50,309
Um... It'll be fun.

708
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:53,549
I... I'd love to.

709
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,579
Uh...

710
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,549
I'm not sure how great
of an idea that is, though.

711
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,189
It's okay.

712
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,490
No sweat.

713
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,220
Hey.

714
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,090
Thanks.

715
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,030
You did good out there, Dawson.

716
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,399
Yeah. Ha.

717
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,400
Thanks, Herrmann.

718
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,400
Got a hell of a coach.

719
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,739
I mean it.

720
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,539
You proved yourself.

721
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,709
I hope this doesn't mean

722
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,710
you're gonna quit
breaking my balls, huh?

723
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:36,389
It's my job
as an old firefighter

724
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:40,530
to teach the young firefighters
how to become old ones.

725
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,539
- Hey.
- Hey.

726
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,739
Well, if you'll excuse me,

727
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:57,089
it appears that the Lieutenant

728
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,440
would like to have a word
with... his candidate.

729
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,210
Thanks, Herrmann.

730
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,249
Gonna check in
on Violet and Christie.

731
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,019
Can I come with you?

732
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,520
As your fiance,
I'd appreciate that.

733
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,660
Hello?

734
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,600
Be right down.

735
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,269
- Hey.
- Hey.

736
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:29,509
Good to see you, Gabby.

737
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:32,240
You will never believe it.

738
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,449
What?

739
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,610
Jim came by.

740
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,049
And?

741
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,380
He's doubling
the child support payments,

742
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:41,319
covering Violet's tuition
at the Latin school,

743
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,559
and he took the house
off the market.

744
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,820
We move back in this weekend.

745
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,690
That's great.

746
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,260
He's not a bad, man, Matt.
I told you.

747
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,529
- He has a good heart.
- Yeah.

748
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:54,830
Congratulations.

749
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,499
Violet must be happy.

750
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,170
She's waiting for you
to tuck her in.

751
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,079
Hey, Matt... Mm-hmm?

752
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,709
Is there something...

753
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,350
I mean, did you do anything
to make it turn out like this?

754
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,459
Violet?

755
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,359
- Hi.
- Hey.

756
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,459
We're moving back
to our old house,

757
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,690
and I'm going back
to my old school.

758
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,829
Yeah, that's what I heard.

759
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,099
I'm so happy.

760
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,560
Yeah, your mom is too.

761
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,530
I know.

762
00:38:26,531 --> 00:38:28,430
Come on, I'll tuck you in.

763
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,570
I knew you'd fix it, uncle Matt.

764
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,479
Turned out, okay, huh?

765
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,809
Yeah.

766
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:39,880
M'wah.

767
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,620
You know I'll always
be there for you.

768
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,289
Turn the iPad off, baby girl.

769
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,889
It's time for bed.

770
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,129
Where you going?

771
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,190
Nowhere.

772
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,829
Look, I left my phone
in the car.

773
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:59,430
- Bed.
- Okay.

774
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,650
Ugh!

775
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,589
Yeah.

776
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,559
You can find me,

777
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,630
but I know where to find you.

778
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,900
Seven out.

779
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,649
- Hey.
- Hey.

780
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:52,819
You play craps at all?

781
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,249
Nope.

782
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,519
Good luck.

783
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,559
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

784
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,759
Wait, come back.

785
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,760
Come on, new girl luck.

786
00:40:00,761 --> 00:40:03,799
It works every time.
Please?

787
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,329
New girl luck?

788
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:07,670
Come on.

789
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,600
Place your bets.

790
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,410
You're the shooter.

791
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:19,410
Just aim for the back wall.

792
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:25,649
- Eight, easy.
- There you go.

793
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:28,419
Okay, what are we going for
this time?

794
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,850
Another eight.

795
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,500
Eight, hard.

796
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,670

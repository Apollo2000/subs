280
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,596
   So she's gonna be hanging
   out here, if that's cool.

281
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,231
 She's been around firehouses.

282
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,267
     She knows how to stay
        out of the way.

283
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:05,303
       - Well, i hope so.
      This is a workplace.

284
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:11,509
         - Don't worry.
     He'll be fine with it.

285
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:14,612
     Something's been going
 on with him the last few days.

286
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:15,680
            - Yeah.

       had a late night.

288
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,692
     - Something like that.

289
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:29,694
           Hey, um...

290
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:33,031
         What happened
        at the academy?

291
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:35,700
        - Me and dawson
    are officially engaged.

         comes through.

298
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,011

 is i don't see anybody's nose

       To the grindstone.

302

 i wanted to hear the proposal

307
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:08,099
           Reach out

 mouch put this thing together.

309
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,740

      in the middle of it?

310
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:18,743
- Because you're a molly's owner
  and you got stake in it too.

311
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:21,679
         Come on, man,

319
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:47,739
    Since we got on the rig
         this morning.

00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,382
           - Uh-huh.
          - For reals?

324
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:59,150
       - For--for reals.

325
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:00,785
        - I had no idea
        that you were--

326
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:03,654
     Wow, congratulations.

      what this guy's on?

344
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,231
 - Most likely heroine or oxy.
  I'm gonna prep the naloxone.

345
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,699
        - Hey, hey, hey,

350

            - What?

397
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,279

      personal about this,

398
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:50,915
       But 105 has filled
     their candidate slot.

     - I don't understand.

00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:55,653
     I-i was told that they
 were holding the slot for me.

00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:59,724
- Apparently they found somebody
  they felt was a better fit.

            - Good.

411
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,017

     it might be some time

412
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:28,653
    Before a slot opens up.

413
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:30,288
        - I understand.

   - Tiberg should've told me
     that this was coming.

417
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:48,372
           - Mm-hmm.

418
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:49,774
     - I feel responsible.

419
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:51,842
      I asked you to stay
         at 51 longer.

420
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:55,313
     - Chief, staying at 51
      after losing shay--

421
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,615
        I wouldn't have
     had it any other way.

422
00:21:57,617 --> 00:21:59,817
          The truth is
   welch was never gonna let

423
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,485
  Another woman in that slot.

424
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,387
     - You dodged a bullet
      not going to austin.

425
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:05,389
      - I am going to talk
     to some of the chiefs.

426
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:07,358
      I'm gonna reach out,

427
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,461
 Shake up some trees and maybe
  something else will come up.

428
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:12,396
          - We'll see.

429
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:15,499
   Thanks, both of you guys.

430
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,607
      [indistinct chatter]

431
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:27,545
       - Uh, lieutenant?

432
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:29,480
    Can i ask you something?

433
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:30,781
       - Yeah, what's up?

434
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:34,385
       - How come my dad
isn't in any of these pictures?

435
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:36,821
     I mean, he's been here
        for a while now.

436
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:40,057
            - Uh...

437
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:43,461
          There he is,
       front and center.

438
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:44,929
          - Oh, yeah.

439
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:46,430
            Thanks.

440
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:00,745
             - Ma.

441
00:23:00,747 --> 00:23:02,079
     - I got your message.

442
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:03,514
        You went to see
     your father's family?

443
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:06,417
        - Yeah, i tried.
It wasn't the warmest reception.

444
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,886
   - I wish that you had come
          to me first.

445
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,521
   - Why would i do that, ma?

446
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:13,691
   Every time i mention them,
   you just me shut me down.

447
00:23:13,693 --> 00:23:17,528
     - These are not people
 that you want to know, peter.

448
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,498
    Your father chose to put
 all this behind him years ago.

449
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,833
        Why do you want
     to dredge it back up?

450
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:25,703
         - Because, ma,
        i want to know.

451
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,875
          - All right.

452
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,913
           As soon as
      your father's family

453
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,581
   Found out he was marrying
         a black woman,

454
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:41,118
     They tried to stop it.

455
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,554
        Henry's parents,
 the way that they treated me,

456
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:46,424
  The things that they said...

457
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:49,193
 I think they were just trying
    to hurt me badly enough

458
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,729
        I would run away
       from your father.

459
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,435
          - I'm sorry.
        - No, don't be.

460
00:23:57,437 --> 00:24:00,638
   Just...Try and understand.

461
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,840
       Your father and i,
   we didn't want that poison

462
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:05,709
        Anywhere near us
        or our children.

463
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:08,913
          - Come here.

464
00:24:11,184 --> 00:24:13,818
           I'm sorry.

465
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,025
            - Daddy.

466
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:23,461
    - Look, you promised me
      you'd sleep, naomi.

467
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:24,762
           - I will.

468
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:26,664
        But i've decided

469
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,966
      I'm not going to go
on the d.C. Trip with my class.

470
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,468
            - Yeah?

471
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,735
 And when did you decide that?

472
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:34,071
            - Today.
             - Hmm.

473
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:37,508
      Well, there's still
another couple of months, okay?

474
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:40,644
      We can think on it.

475
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,880
         - But if i go,

476
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:45,082
   There won't be anyone here
     to keep an eye on you.

477
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,617
          - [chuckles]

478
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,151
   Well, maybe i was looking
     forward to a few days

479
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:49,487
 Without your prying eyes, huh?

480
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:52,490
         - Yeah, right.

481
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:54,992
     But...If i wasn't here

482
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,995
         To remind you
   to be careful on the job,

483
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:00,664
       You might forget.

484
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:04,602
  - I would never forget that.

485
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:07,204
           I promise.

486
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,275
             Fine.

487
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:14,512
   Maybe i will stick around
           for a bit.

488
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:16,914
           Move over.

489
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:19,116
        - Suit yourself.

490
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:33,931
       - Oh, here we go.
         - Don't worry.

491
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:36,567
          I'm not here
 to get all hysterical on you.

492
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:38,869
        I just wanted to
   let you know that you just

493
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:42,006
    Made the biggest mistake
        of your career,

494
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:45,009
           Because i
    am a great firefighter.

495
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:47,311
And i would've worked my ass off
    to make sure that austin

496
00:25:47,313 --> 00:25:51,115
      Became the best damn
     firehouse in chicago.

497
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:54,552
    But i'm gonna go do that
   for another house instead.

498
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:59,189
       Your loss, welch.

499
00:26:02,762 --> 00:26:04,795
          - Hey, hey!
         Knock it off!

500
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:06,330
          - Hey, we're
      just playing around.

501
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:08,299
         Hey, you know,
   i got a question for you.

502
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:10,301
    You are making a killing
         on this place.

503
00:26:10,303 --> 00:26:12,102
            You know
 something i don't understand--

504
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:14,238
         Fill the damn
    snack bowls to the top.

505
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,173
      What are you doing?
     Fill these things up!

506
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:17,808
     - How many has he had?

507
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,877
            - Many.
             - Wow.

508
00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:22,046
     - There's no pretzels.
     There's just peanuts.

509
00:26:22,048 --> 00:26:23,280
     You could put cashews,

510
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:26,083
   All other kinds of treats
       to eat at the bar.

511
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,952
       There's lots of--

512
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:29,653
       Hey, there she is.

513
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,722
             - Hey.
        - Come on over.

514
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:34,124
         - Uh, herrmann
   told me to come by, so...

515
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:35,626
            - I bet.
          Grab a seat.

516
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:37,127
     Make yourself at home.

517
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:40,297
         - Hey, brett,
     thanks for coming by.

518
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:42,032
        - What are you--
     what are you drinking?

519
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:44,301
     - Vodka and cranberry,
            please.

520
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,070
     - No, no, that won't--
     she doesn't want that.

521
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:47,304
           Uh, uh...

522
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:48,272
     Two scotch and sodas.

523
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:54,612
              Wow.

524
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:00,351
            - What?

525
00:27:00,353 --> 00:27:02,319
      - It's crazy, right?

526
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:06,190
        I mean, come on.

527
00:27:06,192 --> 00:27:10,327
     Hey, herrmann, i'm not
the only one who sees it, right?

528
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:13,330
          - See what?

529
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:19,136
     - Herrmann, what the--
     i ordered some drinks.

530
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,739
     Where are the drinks?

531
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:24,742
   - I think you had enough.

532
00:27:24,744 --> 00:27:26,043
     - What? Come on, man,
     what are you talking--

533
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:27,177
        I'm not driving.
     Don't worry about it.

534
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,245
          Don't worry
           about it.

535
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:29,947
       - I'm your friend,

536
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:31,648
  And i'm telling you i think
   you had too much to drink.

537
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:33,717
         There's people
    that you work with here.

538
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:35,085
   - What are you talk--her?
     What are you talking?

539
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,354
       I'm just busting--
    i'm just playing around.

540
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:39,757
      I'm just having fun.
 I'm just getting to know her.

541
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:40,958
            We're--

542
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,726
      - Let me find, uh--
     let me find you a cab.

543
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:44,395
        - That's funny.

544
00:27:44,397 --> 00:27:45,763
           [laughing]
         that's funny.

545
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:47,264
         Are you guys--
       you putting me on?

546
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:48,799
    Guys, i'm sitting down.
      I'm having a drink.

547
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:50,034
    I'm gonna enjoy myself,

548
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:51,435
      And all of a sudden
     it's an intervention?

549
00:27:51,437 --> 00:27:52,936
   - No, no, no, no, come on.

550
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:54,738
     It's just your buddies
      wanting to make sure

551
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,306
       You get home safe.

552
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:57,708
        Come on, kelly,

00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:41,805
             - Cap.
            - Yeah.

691
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:43,240
   - Check out that equipment

692
00:35:43,242 --> 00:35:44,641
 When we get back to the house.

693
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:52,315
    - Okay, so how do i get
        that color here?

694
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,683
      - You need to click
       on that guy there,

695
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:55,452
           And that's
    where the paintbrush is.

696
00:35:55,454 --> 00:35:57,420
       - It's time to go.
        - Oh, oh, cool.

697
00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:58,622
          Oh, no, no,
    please brother, please.

698
00:35:58,624 --> 00:36:00,223
       You're killing me.
       Just--just let her

699
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:01,858
     Stay a little longer.
       - I'm sorry, cruz.

700
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,227
    We got to hit the road.

701
00:36:04,229 --> 00:36:05,862
            - Fine.

702
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:07,496
  - Pack up your stuff, baby.
            - Okay.

703
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,633
       And don't hit exit
        without saving.

704
00:36:09,635 --> 00:36:12,502
         - Chief, look,

705
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,905
     I wanted to thank you
for letting naomi stick around.

706
00:36:14,907 --> 00:36:16,873
        - She seems like
       a very nice girl.

707
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,808
             - Bye.
             - Bye.

708
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,645
            - Yeah.

709
00:36:21,647 --> 00:36:24,581
             Well,
    there's nothing better.

710
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:26,516
          You'll see.

711
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,485
        Let's go, baby.
          - Let's go.

712
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:30,720
     - You had a good day?
            - Yeah!

713
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:33,657
            - Yeah?
     You like the station?

714
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,893
             - Hey.

715
00:36:36,895 --> 00:36:39,596
     Thank you for emailing
   those apartment listings.

716
00:36:39,598 --> 00:36:41,565
     - Oh, yeah, i thought
      i'd give it a shot.

717
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:43,466
     - I'm good where i am.

718
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:45,402
       Hector's actually
       a better neighbor

719
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:47,370
   Than most i had back home.

720
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,606
  - I was looking out for you.
          - Thank you.

721
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:53,510
     You're my first friend
          in chicago.

722
00:36:53,512 --> 00:36:55,545
         You know that?

723
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:03,620
     - Hey, you do a check
          on the scba?

724
00:37:03,622 --> 00:37:06,256
    - Yeah, i couldn't find
    anything wrong with it.

725
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:24,708
    - Wanted to let you know
    i talked to the old man.

726
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,243
    He's willing to see you.

727
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:28,445
   - He's willing to see me?

728
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:29,746
           - Mm-hmm.

729
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:32,315
          - All right,

730
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:34,985
  You go tell leonard mills--
   in fact, you tell anybody

731
00:37:34,987 --> 00:37:36,920
         In joliet with
     the last name mills--

732
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:39,022
      They can go to hell.

733
00:37:57,509 --> 00:38:00,010
            - Okay.

734
00:38:00,012 --> 00:38:03,413
            Wow me.

735
00:38:05,651 --> 00:38:07,984
   - I would like to take you
    through a quick proposal

736
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:11,354
        I put together.

737
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:14,057
      The most successful
          new segment

738
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:17,661
      Of the food service
       industries today--

739
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:19,429
          Food trucks.

740
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:23,533
     All right, food trucks

741
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:25,835
        Are much cheaper
 than restaurants to start up,

742
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:28,438
        So upfront costs
        are much lower.

743
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,608
         Oh, and i did
    a little research, um...

744
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:37,480
 Total revenue for food trucks
   was $804 million in 2013,

745
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:42,552
       And it's projected
to grow to $2.7 billion by 2017.

746
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:45,055
      - Low initial risk,

747
00:38:45,057 --> 00:38:49,492
         Always a solid
      investment strategy.

748
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:52,762
         - Now our plan
     is to turn molly's ii

749
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:53,997
         Into a mobile
      go anywhere business

750
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:56,566
    That can supply everyone

751
00:38:56,568 --> 00:39:00,870
From tailgaters at soldier field
      to students at uic.

752
00:39:00,872 --> 00:39:03,907
     So while we're making
          tons of cash

753
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:06,109
 We are letting everybody know
 the name of the best damn bar

754
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:08,812
          In the city.

755
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:22,125
         - Oh, my god.

756
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:23,860
  He's giving you the move...

757
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:28,765
        The rarely seen
    double overhead shacka!

758
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:30,700
         - What? Yeah?

759
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:31,735
          You like it?

760
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:34,003
          - I love it!
            - Cruz!

761
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:35,872
          You did it!

762
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:39,376
    - Oh, hey, look at that.
            Oh, boy.

763
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:41,111
          Jeez louise.

764
00:39:41,113 --> 00:39:43,380
          Holy smokes!

765
00:39:43,382 --> 00:39:45,815
          - Um...Um...

766
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:47,951
         Um, excuse me,
  i'd just like to understand

767
00:39:47,953 --> 00:39:50,720
   Why our baby has been put
   on the high risk category

768
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,689
  And what we can do about it.

769
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:54,524
       - Your wife's age,

770
00:39:54,526 --> 00:39:56,860
        Medical history
    are the primary reasons.

771
00:39:56,862 --> 00:39:59,496
   And there are some markers
that we need to keep an eye on.

772
00:39:59,498 --> 00:40:00,864
  - What--what does that mean?

773
00:40:00,866 --> 00:40:03,466
        How are we going
        to move forward?

774
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:06,836
            - Honey,
     let the doctor finish.

775
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:09,672
   - The most important thing
         to understand

776
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:11,941
        Is this doesn't
  mean that anything is wrong.

777
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:14,511
       Today's ultrasound
          will give us

778
00:40:14,513 --> 00:40:16,846
        A clearer sense
 of how things are developing.

779
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:24,454
          Here we go.

780
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:28,591
        [heart beating]

781
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:31,127
             Here.

782
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:32,829
         Well, so far,
            so good.

783
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:36,766
All these measurements are right
   where we like them to be.

784
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,536
        - Look at that.

785
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:42,105
           - Already
     an active little one.

786
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:44,174
           [chuckles]

787
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:55,552
          - Erin, hey!

788
00:40:55,554 --> 00:40:57,887
          Listen, i--

789
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:59,556
     I messed this one up.

790
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:01,224
            My bad.
        I was on my way.

791
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:03,793
      I stopped at the bar
       to watch the cubs.

792
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:06,863
        Ugh, i just lost
         track of time.

793
00:41:06,865 --> 00:41:08,965
          - It's okay.

794
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,099
            - Yeah?

795
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:12,936
         - Look, kelly,

796
00:41:12,938 --> 00:41:15,505
          You and me,

797
00:41:15,507 --> 00:41:18,007
         We're cut from
   the same cloth, all right?

798
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:20,643
    I've been where you are,

799
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,546
   And i know how hard it is,

800
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:25,582
    And i know you got to do
     whatever you got to do

801
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:27,617
        To deal with it.

802
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:30,587
   So i will be here for you
          as a friend,

803
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:32,155
   But i will not be the girl

804
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:35,592
 Sitting alone in a restaurant
        waiting for you.

805
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:47,770
         - She was my--

806
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:50,874
    She was my best friend.

807
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:53,910
           - I know.

807
00:41:54,305 --> 00:42:54,483

1
00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:04,052
<i>Battalion 25, engine 51,</i>

2
00:00:04,054 --> 00:00:06,955
<i>Truck 81, squad 3, ambulance 61,</i>

3
00:00:06,957 --> 00:00:10,291
<i>Steel and box alarm,
1100 fulton street.</i>

4
00:00:38,188 --> 00:00:39,154
<i>Main to battalion 25, be aware,</i>

5
00:00:39,156 --> 00:00:42,023
<i>We've received multiple calls
on this fire.</i>

6
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:45,093
Battalion 25
copies that message.

7
00:00:45,095 --> 00:00:46,094
Connie!

8
00:00:46,096 --> 00:00:49,030
Where's connie?
She just left for vacation.

9
00:00:49,032 --> 00:00:49,698
My name's marcie. I'm a temp.

10
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,732
Call headquarters, marcie.

11
00:00:50,734 --> 00:00:54,002
The address for the alarm is on
our target list.

12
00:00:54,004 --> 00:00:54,703
See if they have any information
from fire prevention.

13
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:57,773
Tell 'em to relay it en route.

14
00:00:57,775 --> 00:00:58,775
Yes, sir.

15
00:01:04,348 --> 00:01:05,013
1100 fulton,
that's commercial, isn't it?

16
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:08,383
Big warehouses? Yeah.

17
00:01:08,385 --> 00:01:09,051
Remote area at night.

18
00:01:09,053 --> 00:01:09,851
Must be burning pretty good.

19
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:14,022
To have so many people
call it in.

20
00:01:14,024 --> 00:01:14,523
Unless they're calling
from inside.

21
00:01:14,525 --> 00:01:16,992
How far are we?

22
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:17,559
Four or five blocks.

23
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:18,427
You guys smell that?

24
00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:21,430
Think we got ourselves
a working fire.

25
00:01:21,432 --> 00:01:22,431
I got a feeling we're not
getting any shut-eye tonight.

26
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:25,401
I want everyone ready to go
soon as we land.

27
00:01:25,403 --> 00:01:26,635
Got it, lieutenant.

28
00:01:26,637 --> 00:01:30,039
Herrmann, bring the rope bag.
You have to expect the worst.

29
00:01:51,395 --> 00:01:52,395
Help!

30
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:58,567
We're gonna need every company
in the city.

31
00:02:01,472 --> 00:02:03,973
Hey, what is this place? A club?

32
00:02:03,975 --> 00:02:04,807
The place just went up!

33
00:02:04,809 --> 00:02:07,209
How many inside? I don't know.

34
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:08,411
50, 60? A lot.

35
00:02:08,413 --> 00:02:12,315
It's like a maze.
I couldn't find my way out.

36
00:02:12,317 --> 00:02:13,216
Battalion 25 to main.

37
00:02:13,218 --> 00:02:17,253
Give me a 2-11 alarm
and an ems plan 2.

38
00:02:17,255 --> 00:02:18,120
51, get two lines inside.

39
00:02:18,122 --> 00:02:21,491
You hold that fire
until we evacuate.

40
00:02:21,493 --> 00:02:25,294
77, grab a hydrant on fulton
and feed 51.

41
00:02:25,296 --> 00:02:26,362
Ambo 61 is triage.

42
00:02:26,364 --> 00:02:29,999
The fire is in the tresses.
We need to move fast,

43
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:30,466
Save as many as we can.

44
00:02:30,468 --> 00:02:31,100
Casey? Yeah?

45
00:02:31,102 --> 00:02:32,302
Let herrmann take point.

46
00:02:32,304 --> 00:02:36,005
I need you out here to recon
the outside of the building.

47
00:02:36,007 --> 00:02:37,106
Copy that, chief.
Herrmann, mouch, otis, kidd...

48
00:02:37,108 --> 00:02:40,276
Inside for primary search.
Copy that, lieutenant.

49
00:02:40,946 --> 00:02:45,548
Help! Somebody help!

50
00:02:46,384 --> 00:02:49,085
Hang on!
We're gonna get you out!

51
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:01,097
Come on!

52
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,690
Help! Help!

53
00:03:15,998 --> 00:03:18,864
Easy! Slow down, slow down.

54
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:26,238
All right, you're gonna be
all right. We got you.

55
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:27,306
Capp, get them out of here.
Copy that!

56
00:03:27,309 --> 00:03:31,111
Call me a paramedic.
Come on, guys, follow me.

57
00:03:31,113 --> 00:03:31,678
The door wouldn't open!

58
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,448
All right, let's go.

59
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,954
Fire department! Call out!

60
00:03:49,531 --> 00:03:52,266
Fire department! Call out!

61
00:03:52,935 --> 00:03:56,236
81! We got a victim here!

62
00:03:56,238 --> 00:03:59,707
Got her! I got you!

63
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:02,608
Come on,
let's get you out of here.

64
00:04:02,611 --> 00:04:05,112
Cruz, you grab the search line.

65
00:04:05,113 --> 00:04:08,147
Tie it off.
Truck, you guys go right.

66
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,751
Squad, we'll take left.
Let's go! Let's move!

67
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:13,820
Hey, copy that.
Mouch, anchor the line up.

68
00:04:13,823 --> 00:04:14,888
Right!

69
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:18,592
Hey, you two keep within reach
of me, all right?

70
00:04:18,594 --> 00:04:20,761
Let's not get lost in this dump.

71
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:21,362
You good? Good.

72
00:04:21,363 --> 00:04:23,697
Let's go. Copy!

73
00:04:49,358 --> 00:04:51,993
Hey! Yeah, I'm right here.

74
00:04:52,762 --> 00:04:55,463
Careful, careful. Otis, hey.

75
00:04:58,101 --> 00:05:01,234
She's not breathing.
I'll intubate.

76
00:05:01,237 --> 00:05:02,136
What's the layout in there?

77
00:05:02,137 --> 00:05:04,604
It's crazy. It's full of stuff.

78
00:05:04,607 --> 00:05:06,087
It's practically made
out of kindling.

79
00:05:08,078 --> 00:05:11,378
We're gonna pull a lot of bodies
out of there, chief.

80
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:12,579
I was dancing with this girl
when the fire started.

81
00:05:12,582 --> 00:05:16,651
I don't even know her name,
but she was in a-a pink dress.

82
00:05:16,652 --> 00:05:17,252
I... I think she's still inside.

83
00:05:17,253 --> 00:05:20,988
We'll keep an eye out.

84
00:05:37,007 --> 00:05:39,808
Chief walker's here.
Let me go in.

85
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,142
Go. Otis, let's go.

86
00:05:46,517 --> 00:05:48,916
Fire department! Call out!

87
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:56,123
Fire department! Call out!

88
00:05:58,462 --> 00:06:01,029
Fire department! Hey!

89
00:06:01,031 --> 00:06:01,463
Fire department!

90
00:06:01,464 --> 00:06:04,166
Help! Help!

91
00:06:07,204 --> 00:06:07,502
Where are you?

92
00:06:07,503 --> 00:06:10,939
Help!

93
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,742
Herrmann, up there!

94
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,213
Up here...

95
00:06:18,214 --> 00:06:20,748
Where the hell are the stairs?

96
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:23,285
I don't know!

97
00:06:23,286 --> 00:06:26,088
Truck 81 to battalion 25.

98
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:29,625
<i>We need an attic ladder
up here, inside.</i>

99
00:06:29,627 --> 00:06:30,559
Give me a minute, 81.

100
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,661
Next available truck
will bring you one.

101
00:06:33,731 --> 00:06:36,298
Okay, let's improvise a ladder.

102
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:36,998
Copy. Got it.

103
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:40,603
You, up there, stay with me.

104
00:06:40,604 --> 00:06:42,938
I'm gonna get you.

105
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:46,976
Ladder! Give me a hand!

106
00:06:55,553 --> 00:06:56,553
Hang on!

107
00:06:59,022 --> 00:06:59,588
Okay, hold it steady.

108
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:02,958
We got it. Go ahead.

109
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:05,627
Okay, hon, you're coming
with me, all right?

110
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,829
Help us!

111
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,765
Hey, stay there, we can only
take one person at a time.

112
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:10,866
Hey, do not climb over here!

113
00:07:10,868 --> 00:07:14,570
This thing's not gonna
hold too much weight up there.

114
00:07:14,572 --> 00:07:17,739
I said stop! Stop! Aah!

115
00:07:24,582 --> 00:07:28,351
Mouch! Chief, mouch is down!

116
00:07:28,353 --> 00:07:30,585
Mouch! Mouch!

117
00:07:38,228 --> 00:07:38,962
What happened?

118
00:07:38,964 --> 00:07:42,265
Mouch is under here! Wait.

119
00:07:42,267 --> 00:07:43,065
Mouch, hang in there, buddy.

120
00:07:43,068 --> 00:07:45,568
We're gonna get you
out of there.

121
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,469
You got it?

122
00:07:46,471 --> 00:07:49,138
All right, let's get
these victims out!

123
00:07:49,141 --> 00:07:49,671
Hurry!

124
00:07:49,674 --> 00:07:53,510
Hold on, come on.

125
00:07:53,512 --> 00:07:55,245
Come on.

126
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:01,564
Stay there. Stay down.
Be right there.

127
00:08:03,454 --> 00:08:07,123
Hang in there, buddy.
We've got you.

128
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,258
You got it? All right, on three.

129
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:11,761
One, two, three.

130
00:08:11,762 --> 00:08:15,632
Down, down. Okay, pull up.

131
00:08:16,267 --> 00:08:19,636
You got him?

132
00:08:19,637 --> 00:08:22,405
Hey, buddy?

133
00:08:22,406 --> 00:08:25,075
You all right? Let's go!

134
00:08:25,844 --> 00:08:29,246
My name's matt. Who are you?

135
00:08:29,248 --> 00:08:30,213
I'm kathy.

136
00:08:30,214 --> 00:08:32,683
We're gonna follow this line
out of here.

137
00:08:32,685 --> 00:08:33,015
Hang on to me, okay?

138
00:08:33,017 --> 00:08:35,319
Okay.

139
00:08:40,192 --> 00:08:43,293
That sucked. Hey, come here.

140
00:08:43,294 --> 00:08:45,995
Come on, easy, easy. Wait... okay.

141
00:08:49,568 --> 00:08:52,503
Take it slow.
All right, we got you.

142
00:08:58,744 --> 00:08:59,510
Chout! Yep!

143
00:08:59,512 --> 00:09:01,812
Smoke inhalation.

144
00:09:01,813 --> 00:09:03,013
A few lacerations.

145
00:09:03,014 --> 00:09:06,984
She's having trouble breathing.
We'll take care of her.

146
00:09:06,986 --> 00:09:10,053
You're gonna be okay, kathy.
Hang in there.

147
00:09:17,796 --> 00:09:19,597
Hey, 61, heads up!

148
00:09:23,636 --> 00:09:27,537
All right, you're okay, buddy.

149
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,272
Where are you hurt?

150
00:09:28,274 --> 00:09:31,007
All right. He got pancaked.

151
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,311
I'm okay, really.

152
00:09:33,312 --> 00:09:34,178
Take him in.

153
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:37,548
Casey, there's a lot more...
Mouch.

154
00:09:44,424 --> 00:09:45,121
Three minutes
and nobody else goes inside.

155
00:09:45,123 --> 00:09:48,458
Squad 3, evacuate the building.

156
00:09:53,099 --> 00:09:55,466
Severide, report!

157
00:09:55,467 --> 00:09:56,534
Severide!

158
00:09:56,535 --> 00:09:59,102
<i>On our way, chief.
Bringing out two victims.</i>

159
00:09:59,104 --> 00:09:59,570
Wallace. Wallace.

160
00:09:59,572 --> 00:10:02,072
Al, what is it?

161
00:10:02,074 --> 00:10:04,808
My daughter, lexi.
She's in there.

162
00:10:04,811 --> 00:10:05,642
What? She's in there.

163
00:10:05,644 --> 00:10:06,576
My daughter, lexi.
She's in there.

164
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:11,548
What? Hey, hey, hey, hey!
My god!

165
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:17,590
She's been living here
for a month.

166
00:10:17,592 --> 00:10:18,491
I just got
off the phone with her.

167
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:19,292
A couple of hours ago,
and she was here!

168
00:10:19,294 --> 00:10:22,095
Okay. Let's try and find her.

169
00:10:22,097 --> 00:10:23,897
Come on.

170
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:38,512
Dawson! You seen olinsky's
daughter, lexi?

171
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:39,446
Hey...

172
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:41,448
Well, she didn't come
through triage.

173
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,149
Wallace...

174
00:10:42,151 --> 00:10:47,154
Wallace, I beg you. I beg you.

175
00:10:47,156 --> 00:10:49,690
Al, I have pulled my people out.

176
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:50,958
That building's gonna collapse
any second.

177
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,462
We have got to get water on that
fire and hope that she made it.

178
00:10:55,464 --> 00:10:58,065
Chief,
severide and cruz are back.

179
00:10:58,067 --> 00:10:59,199
Severide, report.

180
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:04,204
It's bad. We can hear voices
in the back, delta side.

181
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:04,905
We're gonna need another minute.

182
00:11:04,907 --> 00:11:07,908
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

183
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,742
Al! We got to go in there!

184
00:11:08,744 --> 00:11:11,745
Wait! Hold on. We got to go in!

185
00:11:11,747 --> 00:11:15,716
Hold back.
I'm begging you, man. Please.

186
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:18,452
Please! I'm begging you.

187
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,929
Lead the way.

188
00:11:39,642 --> 00:11:42,643
Hang tight, mouch. Yep.

189
00:11:49,485 --> 00:11:53,354
Maggie! Maggie.

190
00:11:53,356 --> 00:11:55,690
Mouch? Hey.

191
00:11:55,692 --> 00:11:56,490
Hey. You okay? I'm good.

192
00:11:56,492 --> 00:12:00,494
Let me check you. Incoming.

193
00:12:00,496 --> 00:12:01,195
Jumped out
of a second-story window.

194
00:12:01,197 --> 00:12:04,298
Gcs 3, intubated in the field.

195
00:12:06,603 --> 00:12:07,468
Lungs are clear.
Let's get a chest x-ray.

196
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,436
And call trauma down now.
Maggie?

197
00:12:08,438 --> 00:12:11,873
Trauma 3 just opened up.
Go, go, go, go, go.

198
00:12:13,877 --> 00:12:14,575
I'll check in
at the nurse's station.

199
00:12:14,577 --> 00:12:15,376
Wait a second. Maggie,

200
00:12:15,378 --> 00:12:18,579
Help the ones
who really need it.

201
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:20,648
You sure?
Yeah. Get back to the fire.

202
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,618
Okay. Yeah?

203
00:12:27,657 --> 00:12:29,958
Chout, go!

204
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,525
I need some help over here!

205
00:12:30,527 --> 00:12:34,162
I need some help here!

206
00:12:38,802 --> 00:12:41,236
Fire department! Call out!

207
00:12:45,575 --> 00:12:48,643
They'll find her.

208
00:12:48,645 --> 00:12:51,146
Fire department! Call out!

209
00:12:51,148 --> 00:12:54,149
Back here! Help us!

210
00:12:54,151 --> 00:12:55,151
This way!

211
00:13:02,492 --> 00:13:05,327
Lexi!

212
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:06,094
Hey, lexi.

213
00:13:06,096 --> 00:13:09,030
Hey, lexi. Come on, come on.

214
00:13:09,032 --> 00:13:12,167
Stay with us.

215
00:13:16,607 --> 00:13:19,141
It's too hot.

216
00:13:19,143 --> 00:13:19,975
Through that wall!

217
00:13:19,977 --> 00:13:24,680
Lexi. Come on, lexi.
Get down. Come on.

218
00:13:24,682 --> 00:13:26,648
I got her. Go.

219
00:13:36,627 --> 00:13:38,894
Severide! Boden!

220
00:13:41,532 --> 00:13:42,531
Someone! Report!

221
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:47,002
I'm going in after them.
No! Stay there.

222
00:14:00,785 --> 00:14:02,518
Lexi!

223
00:14:11,162 --> 00:14:14,063
We got her.
We got her. Let us work.

224
00:14:14,065 --> 00:14:14,663
We got her. We got her.

225
00:14:14,665 --> 00:14:15,531
Let us do our job, okay?

226
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:19,335
Lexi, baby.
Watch out. Watch out.

227
00:14:25,376 --> 00:14:27,143
Take the front seat, al.

228
00:14:46,464 --> 00:14:48,998
I'm bringing down extra staff
from upstairs.

229
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,732
How many nurses do you need?

230
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:53,236
Everybody you got. Okay.

231
00:14:59,711 --> 00:15:03,212
Dr. Choi? I'm coordinating
with the burn unit,

232
00:15:03,214 --> 00:15:05,682
So if there's anything you need,
you let me know.

233
00:15:05,684 --> 00:15:07,850
Got it.

234
00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:11,621
You good?

235
00:15:11,623 --> 00:15:12,555
Ms. Goodwin,
if you're worried about me.

236
00:15:12,557 --> 00:15:13,389
Because of the burn victim
I lost last week...

237
00:15:13,391 --> 00:15:14,524
No, no. I just want to make sure.

238
00:15:14,526 --> 00:15:17,794
You stop and catch your breath
every once in a while.

239
00:15:17,796 --> 00:15:18,394
That's all.

240
00:15:18,396 --> 00:15:21,164
Yes, ma'am. Okay.

241
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,298
I just heard.
Yeah, there are a whole lot.

242
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,635
Of patients, family, and friends
here who may need help.

243
00:15:25,637 --> 00:15:25,969
You might need more staff.

244
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:29,005
Got it.

245
00:15:31,576 --> 00:15:34,411
Got a 19-year-old
with large area 3rd degree burns.

246
00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:35,145
And smoke inhalation.

247
00:15:35,147 --> 00:15:36,012
All right. Take her to baghdad.

248
00:15:36,014 --> 00:15:38,949
Copy.
Tachypneic and tachycardic.

249
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:39,951
Sats are marginal.

250
00:15:42,187 --> 00:15:47,757
Hey, lexi, I'm here.
She's awake.

251
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:48,758
Natalie, with me.

252
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,061
What kind of body surface area
are we talking?

253
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:52,063
Sixty percent.

254
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:57,434
All right. On my count.

255
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:03,540
One, two, three.

256
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:06,443
Draw an abg, cbc,
carboxyhemoglobin, and lactate.

257
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:10,213
Get a chest x-ray
and run her fluids wide open.

258
00:16:10,215 --> 00:16:11,775
Lexi, I'm dr. Halstead.
Can you hear me?

259
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,352
She's barely moving air.
Swelling's getting worse.

260
00:16:15,354 --> 00:16:16,386
We need to intubate.

261
00:16:16,388 --> 00:16:19,890
Got it. Give me
20 of etomidate, 60 of roc.

262
00:16:19,892 --> 00:16:22,392
You're gonna be okay,
sweetheart.

263
00:16:22,394 --> 00:16:23,026
You're gonna be okay.

264
00:16:23,028 --> 00:16:24,194
Hey, al. You're okay.

265
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:28,165
Come on. Come on. Let us
take care of her, all right?

266
00:16:36,075 --> 00:16:37,007
Her airway's really tight.

267
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:39,209
She's bradying down.
You want the cric kit?

268
00:16:39,211 --> 00:16:40,211
Nope.

269
00:16:44,016 --> 00:16:44,815
I'm in.

270
00:16:44,817 --> 00:16:46,851
All right, get her on the vent.

271
00:16:46,853 --> 00:16:48,586
Nice job.

272
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,322
How the hell does something
like this happen?

273
00:17:24,324 --> 00:17:26,390
Wish I knew, chief.

274
00:17:37,871 --> 00:17:41,372
Let's get some blankets
on these bodies.

275
00:17:41,374 --> 00:17:43,241
Let's cover them up. Yeah.

276
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:11,156
I saw you at the fire.

277
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:14,726
What happened?

278
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:17,696
A balcony collapsed.
I was underneath.

279
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:20,599
But I was lucky.
They pulled us out quick.

280
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:23,635
I was lucky, too.

281
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:27,172
Everyone was screaming
and pushing.

282
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:29,775
Then I saw a window
through all the smoke,

283
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:31,844
Just ran for it.

284
00:18:39,987 --> 00:18:43,922
The window was up high, so I
climbed and pulled myself out.

285
00:18:43,924 --> 00:18:46,525
That's good.

286
00:18:46,527 --> 00:18:49,928
No. No, I don't think so.

287
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:56,635
I couldn't reach,
so I stepped on something...

288
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:58,571
Someone.

289
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:05,344
I stepped on someone to get out.

290
00:19:05,346 --> 00:19:07,513
Maybe they were still alive.
I don't even know.

291
00:19:07,515 --> 00:19:10,316
Hey, hey.

292
00:19:10,318 --> 00:19:13,386
I was so scared.

293
00:19:13,388 --> 00:19:16,756
If I'd just stopped to help,
maybe they'd be okay.

294
00:19:16,758 --> 00:19:18,691
Maybe they are.

295
00:19:20,361 --> 00:19:22,895
No..

296
00:19:22,897 --> 00:19:26,566
Listen. Listen to me.

297
00:19:26,568 --> 00:19:29,335
You didn't start that fire.

298
00:19:29,337 --> 00:19:33,840
Whatever happened,
none of this is on you.

299
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:56,029
Al. Al.

300
00:19:56,031 --> 00:20:01,034
Hey.

301
00:20:01,036 --> 00:20:01,868
They're working on her in there,

302
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,871
Got her in a medical coma,
I think.

303
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,675
Can I get you anything, or...

304
00:20:08,677 --> 00:20:11,478
She was breathing.

305
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,212
And I saw her eyes open, so.

306
00:20:12,214 --> 00:20:15,148
That's good, al. Yeah.

307
00:20:18,186 --> 00:20:18,752
So she's gonna be okay. Yeah.

308
00:20:18,754 --> 00:20:21,488
She's gonna be okay.

309
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,159
Hey.

310
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:29,329
Hey.
We've put lexi on a ventilator.

311
00:20:29,331 --> 00:20:30,430
And sedated her. Okay.

312
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:32,666
Okay, we'll keep her there
for the next 24 hours,

313
00:20:32,668 --> 00:20:33,200
Watch her closely.

314
00:20:33,202 --> 00:20:34,134
She's in burn shock.

315
00:20:34,136 --> 00:20:39,673
Her lungs were badly injured
by the smoke.

316
00:20:39,675 --> 00:20:43,176
We're doing everything
we can for her.

317
00:20:43,178 --> 00:20:44,144
Is she gonna be okay?

318
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:46,747
We're gonna take
really good care of her.

319
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:47,347
Can I go in and see her?

320
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:50,651
Of course. Okay.

321
00:21:10,606 --> 00:21:12,673
Baby...

322
00:21:26,188 --> 00:21:30,124
Sweet girl...

323
00:21:30,126 --> 00:21:32,192
Hey, sweet girl.

324
00:21:35,765 --> 00:21:37,498
Sweet girl.

325
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:08,563
Hey.

326
00:22:08,565 --> 00:22:09,697
Chief. Sergeant.

327
00:22:09,699 --> 00:22:13,634
I understand the only reason
lexi olinsky is alive.

328
00:22:13,636 --> 00:22:14,001
Is because of you.

329
00:22:14,003 --> 00:22:16,504
Thank you.

330
00:22:16,506 --> 00:22:19,507
Just one father looking out
for another.

331
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:20,441
Commander. Chief.

332
00:22:20,443 --> 00:22:24,112
This is lieutenant
alexa hubble from ofi.

333
00:22:24,114 --> 00:22:26,581
Hank voight, intelligence.
This is commander crowley.

334
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:27,749
Lieutenant. Casey.

335
00:22:27,751 --> 00:22:31,219
All right, so what do we know?
Building owner's name is

336
00:22:31,221 --> 00:22:31,920
Barry kimball.

337
00:22:31,922 --> 00:22:32,887
He's already reached out to cfd,

338
00:22:32,889 --> 00:22:33,821
Promised to cooperate
with the investigation.

339
00:22:33,823 --> 00:22:36,891
Does he know how many people
were living.

340
00:22:36,893 --> 00:22:37,458
And partying on his property?

341
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,829
According to him, no.

342
00:22:40,831 --> 00:22:43,832
He thought it was
just a small group.

343
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:44,766
When can my investigators get
inside?

344
00:22:44,768 --> 00:22:50,004
66, can we release the scene
to ofi yet?

345
00:22:50,006 --> 00:22:50,505
<i>Affirmative. We're done in here.</i>

346
00:22:50,507 --> 00:22:53,641
Scene's all yours.

347
00:22:53,643 --> 00:22:54,209
You want to join us? Please.

348
00:22:54,211 --> 00:22:57,078
Thank you, lieutenant.

349
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,702
I saw it on the news.

350
00:23:53,704 --> 00:23:55,471
It must have been really rough.

351
00:24:00,578 --> 00:24:01,577
Well, you guys should
eat something.

352
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:04,780
I don't think anyone's
too hungry right now.

353
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:21,230
Hospital update.
Death toll's up to 33.

354
00:24:21,232 --> 00:24:23,299
Otis.

355
00:24:23,301 --> 00:24:24,301
Sorry.

356
00:24:33,811 --> 00:24:38,447
All those kids
out having a good time.

357
00:24:38,449 --> 00:24:41,517
And that guy looking for his
dancing girl in a pink dress.

358
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:44,520
I know.
Didn't even know her name.

359
00:24:44,522 --> 00:24:47,590
Wait, pink dress?

360
00:24:47,592 --> 00:24:49,112
We pulled out a girl
with a pink dress.

361
00:24:52,063 --> 00:24:52,862
What was her condition?

362
00:24:52,864 --> 00:24:56,766
Not great,
but we got her to a rig.

363
00:24:56,768 --> 00:24:57,667
You remember her name?

364
00:24:57,669 --> 00:25:01,437
Damn. No... But casey talked to her.

365
00:25:04,476 --> 00:25:05,476
I'll call him.

366
00:25:08,246 --> 00:25:08,845
<i>Hi. It's anna.
Leave me a message,</i>

367
00:25:08,847 --> 00:25:12,782
<i>And I'll call you back.</i>

368
00:25:12,784 --> 00:25:13,650
Hey, anna. It's me.

369
00:25:13,652 --> 00:25:16,853
Um, sorry I haven't
gotten in touch.

370
00:25:16,855 --> 00:25:20,924
I guess I wasn't sure
if you'd want to hear from me.

371
00:25:20,926 --> 00:25:24,160
We... we had a pretty rough night
here,

372
00:25:24,162 --> 00:25:27,097
And, thing is...

373
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:27,797
I miss you.

374
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:31,067
It'd be nice to hear your voice.

375
00:25:31,069 --> 00:25:33,136
If you get a sec,
give me a call.

376
00:25:33,138 --> 00:25:34,138
Bye.

377
00:25:38,877 --> 00:25:39,843
Hey. You heading home?

378
00:25:39,845 --> 00:25:42,679
No. I'm gonna head back
to the factory,

379
00:25:42,681 --> 00:25:43,681
See if ofi needs a hand.

380
00:25:57,696 --> 00:25:58,562
Suzi's working
in the southwest quadrant.

381
00:25:58,564 --> 00:26:00,964
You want to help her out,
severide?

382
00:26:00,966 --> 00:26:04,000
I'd be happy to.

383
00:26:04,002 --> 00:26:04,634
Please.
I'm just here to pay my respects.

384
00:26:04,636 --> 00:26:07,037
On this tragic, tragic day.

385
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:07,938
When was the last time.

386
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,139
Your building was inspected
by the city?

387
00:26:09,141 --> 00:26:10,007
I don't know any more than
you do about why this happened.

388
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:14,611
I'm just here to say
how sorry I am...

389
00:26:14,613 --> 00:26:17,447
How deeply sorry I am
for my part in any of this.

390
00:26:17,449 --> 00:26:18,315
You own this fire trap?

391
00:26:18,317 --> 00:26:19,349
Okay, everybody needs
to back up.

392
00:26:19,351 --> 00:26:22,853
Officer, who is he?
He's the property owner.

393
00:26:22,855 --> 00:26:25,355
My cousin died in there!
Where were the fire exits?

394
00:26:25,357 --> 00:26:26,156
Where were the sprinklers?

395
00:26:26,158 --> 00:26:27,057
I thought the building was safe.

396
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:29,359
You killed them!
Okay, everyone needs.

397
00:26:29,361 --> 00:26:30,360
To disperse, now! Hey!

398
00:26:30,362 --> 00:26:34,865
What the hell is this?

399
00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:35,867
Hey!

400
00:26:39,238 --> 00:26:40,004
Come on! Come on!

401
00:26:40,006 --> 00:26:42,773
Go, go, go, go, go! Come on!

402
00:26:42,775 --> 00:26:43,574
Okay, everybody. Calm down!

403
00:26:43,576 --> 00:26:45,909
You're gonna have to relax, sir.

404
00:26:45,911 --> 00:26:46,911
Everybody go home.

405
00:26:49,382 --> 00:26:51,982
Calm down. Calm down!

406
00:26:58,867 --> 00:26:59,901
Am I under arrest? No.

407
00:26:59,903 --> 00:27:00,968
This is just a conversation.

408
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:05,173
Some place you won't
be overrun by an angry mob.

409
00:27:05,175 --> 00:27:08,276
There weren't supposed to be
that many people inside.

410
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:09,210
Those parties are
usually a lot smaller.

411
00:27:09,212 --> 00:27:12,013
Mr. Kimball,
your building isn't permitted.

412
00:27:12,015 --> 00:27:13,114
For public events of any size.

413
00:27:13,116 --> 00:27:16,017
Am I to understand that you had
people living there?

414
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:17,051
Just a few.

415
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:19,587
In a building not zoned
for residential use.

416
00:27:19,589 --> 00:27:20,288
I was just trying to help
those kids.

417
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,222
They don't have a lot of money,

418
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:24,292
And chicago is so expensive
these days.

419
00:27:24,294 --> 00:27:27,095
I'm not some slumlord
trying to make a fast buck.

420
00:27:27,097 --> 00:27:27,896
That was my father's factory.

421
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:28,696
I didn't want
to just get rid of it.

422
00:27:28,698 --> 00:27:32,934
And if these kids want
to live there.

423
00:27:32,936 --> 00:27:33,735
And use it to create their art...

424
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:37,972
You get the building up to code.

425
00:27:37,974 --> 00:27:38,406
Give them someplace
safe to live.

426
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:43,244
What can I do?

427
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:47,248
What can I do to make it right?

428
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,818
You can start by making us
a list of all of your tenants.

429
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,420
And anyone who had access
to the factory.

430
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:58,493
This place is...
What's the word? Byzantine?

431
00:28:02,165 --> 00:28:06,468
No sprinkler system,
no clearly marked exit signs,

432
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,736
No fire extinguishers.

433
00:28:07,738 --> 00:28:11,306
I saw one back there, but it
hasn't been inspected since '95.

434
00:28:11,308 --> 00:28:12,007
I stand corrected.

435
00:28:12,009 --> 00:28:14,910
My money's on electrical fire.

436
00:28:14,912 --> 00:28:17,646
Wiring in this place is
a nightmare.

437
00:28:17,648 --> 00:28:20,682
I'm gonna say open flame.
You know, space heater,

438
00:28:20,684 --> 00:28:21,583
A candle that got kicked over.

439
00:28:21,585 --> 00:28:24,786
Hey, suzi,
look at this burn pattern.

440
00:28:28,392 --> 00:28:29,157
Think this could be
the area of origin?

441
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:32,828
Could be. Yeah, yeah, could be.

442
00:28:39,503 --> 00:28:40,503
Whoa.

443
00:28:42,373 --> 00:28:45,407
We found out her first name.
It's kathy.

444
00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:49,144
Kathy.
We checked at area hospitals,

445
00:28:49,146 --> 00:28:49,845
And they haven't
found a kathy yet,

446
00:28:49,847 --> 00:28:50,746
But they're sending us a list.

447
00:28:50,748 --> 00:28:53,582
Of all of their kathleens
and kathryns.

448
00:28:53,584 --> 00:28:56,352
If she isn't
at any of the hospitals,

449
00:28:56,354 --> 00:29:01,490
Is there a chance that...
She didn't make it?

450
00:29:01,492 --> 00:29:04,326
Last our guy saw, she was alive.

451
00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:06,362
Okay.

452
00:29:06,364 --> 00:29:09,365
Okay. Thanks.

453
00:29:09,367 --> 00:29:12,301
When I was dancing
with that girl...

454
00:29:12,303 --> 00:29:14,470
With kathy...

455
00:29:14,472 --> 00:29:16,839
I was thinking,

456
00:29:16,841 --> 00:29:19,308
"I'm gonna remember this night."

457
00:29:22,346 --> 00:29:23,579
Now everyone will.

458
00:29:23,581 --> 00:29:27,683
We'll let you know as soon
as we find anything out, okay?

459
00:29:32,423 --> 00:29:35,625
Something good has to come out
of what happened there, right?

460
00:29:38,663 --> 00:29:38,961
We'll find her?

461
00:29:38,963 --> 00:29:42,064
Yeah.

462
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,841
Okay, sweetie, take care.
We'll see you later.

463
00:29:56,781 --> 00:29:59,015
We don't really know
if she's okay.

464
00:29:59,017 --> 00:30:00,750
Can't stop now.

465
00:30:10,895 --> 00:30:15,031
Chief?

466
00:30:15,033 --> 00:30:17,567
Chicago med has lost
another victim.

467
00:30:17,569 --> 00:30:20,270
That brings it up to 36.

468
00:30:20,272 --> 00:30:22,605
I know.
That's on you, mr. Kimball.

469
00:30:22,607 --> 00:30:25,942
Easy. He gets it.

470
00:30:25,944 --> 00:30:28,845
Sure. He gets it now.

471
00:30:28,847 --> 00:30:29,479
Far too late
for all those young people.

472
00:30:29,481 --> 00:30:33,450
And their grieving families.

473
00:30:33,452 --> 00:30:34,050
Lieutenant, is there a,

474
00:30:34,052 --> 00:30:39,689
Um, bathroom I could use?

475
00:30:39,691 --> 00:30:42,859
Yeah. Straight back,
down the hall.

476
00:30:42,861 --> 00:30:44,594
Thank you.

477
00:30:57,009 --> 00:30:57,641
Are there any exits
near the bathroom?

478
00:30:57,643 --> 00:31:01,244
He's not going anywhere.

479
00:31:16,962 --> 00:31:17,962
My god.

480
00:31:31,332 --> 00:31:34,767
Mr. Kimball's rash and tragic
decision to take his own life.

481
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:39,505
Will not slow or alter
our investigation.

482
00:31:39,507 --> 00:31:44,744
We want to know why
and how this fire happened,

483
00:31:44,746 --> 00:31:47,613
And we will get answers.

484
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:51,217
My office is working
with the chicago police.

485
00:31:51,219 --> 00:31:52,085
And with cfd.

486
00:31:52,087 --> 00:31:56,155
Our city and our people are
stronger.

487
00:31:56,157 --> 00:32:00,093
When we come together,
and it is my hope.

488
00:32:00,095 --> 00:32:00,994
That the citizens of chicago
will continue...

489
00:32:00,996 --> 00:32:04,464
Did nobody think
to pat this guy down?

490
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:07,100
I was there to protect him,
ma'am, not arrest him.

491
00:32:07,102 --> 00:32:08,201
Kimball was under threat
at the fire scene,

492
00:32:08,203 --> 00:32:11,771
So lieutenant hubble asked
if we could bring him here.

493
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:19,412
This is a tragic end
to a tragic day.

494
00:32:30,525 --> 00:32:34,527
Excuse me?
I'm sorry to interrupt,

495
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:37,264
But is one of you named
matt casey?

496
00:32:37,266 --> 00:32:37,964
Yeah. That's me.

497
00:32:37,966 --> 00:32:41,801
You saved my daughter's life.

498
00:32:41,803 --> 00:32:42,736
All of you did.

499
00:32:42,738 --> 00:32:43,804
She remembered
everything you said to her,

500
00:32:43,806 --> 00:32:47,374
Said if it wasn't for you,
she never would've made it.

501
00:32:47,376 --> 00:32:48,175
Out of the factory.

502
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:52,679
We own kathy's polish deli
on 17th,

503
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:53,680
And we'd be honored
if you all came by.

504
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:58,652
For some of the best kielbasa
in town, on us.

505
00:32:58,654 --> 00:32:59,252
Bring everyone.

506
00:32:59,254 --> 00:33:00,454
That's very generous.

507
00:33:00,456 --> 00:33:05,058
Yeah, you know, that sounds
like just the right thing,

508
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,861
So I'll put the word out.

509
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:08,695
It's kathy's deli?

510
00:33:08,697 --> 00:33:12,666
Yes. It's named
after our daughter,

511
00:33:12,668 --> 00:33:13,668
The light of our life.

512
00:33:17,206 --> 00:33:18,206
Appreciate it.

513
00:33:58,214 --> 00:33:59,214
Come on in.

514
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:07,021
Lieutenant casey would like
to have a word.

515
00:34:11,794 --> 00:34:15,096
That was the first day you had.

516
00:34:15,098 --> 00:34:18,166
Yeah, it was.

517
00:34:24,541 --> 00:34:26,674
Is there anything
I can get for you, chief?

518
00:34:26,676 --> 00:34:27,676
No. I'm good.

519
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,781
You can send in
lieutenant casey now.

520
00:34:33,783 --> 00:34:34,783
Thank you, marcie.

521
00:34:40,123 --> 00:34:42,824
He'll see you now. Thanks.

522
00:34:42,892 --> 00:34:43,892
Hey. Hey.

523
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:49,864
Heading out.
Just wanted to check in,

524
00:34:49,866 --> 00:34:50,565
See if you needed anything.

525
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:53,802
No. Go on, get out of here.

526
00:34:58,442 --> 00:35:01,443
We've both talked to people
on ledges.

527
00:35:01,445 --> 00:35:05,280
Usually we can tell
if they're really gonna jump.

528
00:35:05,282 --> 00:35:05,980
How'd we miss this?

529
00:35:05,982 --> 00:35:08,483
Maybe he wasn't planning it.

530
00:35:08,485 --> 00:35:11,519
Maybe he just got overwhelmed.

531
00:35:14,558 --> 00:35:18,460
Whatever the reason, I wish that
we could've stopped it.

532
00:35:18,462 --> 00:35:21,263
Yeah.

533
00:35:21,265 --> 00:35:22,164
Chief,
lieutenant severide's here.

534
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:25,066
Chief, you're gonna want
to see this.

535
00:35:30,107 --> 00:35:32,441
Okay. What did you find?

536
00:35:32,443 --> 00:35:35,377
That's where the fire started.

537
00:35:35,379 --> 00:35:38,680
And that's what we found there.

538
00:35:38,682 --> 00:35:39,815
Electrical fire?

539
00:35:39,817 --> 00:35:43,185
That's a timing device.
You take a brown paper bag,

540
00:35:43,187 --> 00:35:43,819
And you fill it
with an oxidizer...

541
00:35:43,821 --> 00:35:44,953
Kitty litter or chlorine.

542
00:35:44,955 --> 00:35:49,224
Then you take a light bulb
and you fill it with fuel...

543
00:35:49,226 --> 00:35:50,392
Gasoline, cooking oil, whatever.

544
00:35:50,394 --> 00:35:55,164
And you see the drill hole?
That's where they filled it.

545
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:56,298
You put the light bulb
in the bag.

546
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:00,936
Right. And now you've got
a simple incendiary device.

547
00:36:00,938 --> 00:36:03,238
Drop the bag on the floor, you
step on the bulb with your heel,

548
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,141
And just walk away.

549
00:36:06,143 --> 00:36:09,912
Chemical reaction
would start right away.

550
00:36:09,914 --> 00:36:12,915
Instructions are easy to find
with a quick internet search.

551
00:36:33,171 --> 00:36:36,272
Kelly, hey.

552
00:36:36,274 --> 00:36:39,742
There is someone to see you
on the amp floor.

553
00:36:39,744 --> 00:36:42,545
Thanks.

554
00:36:54,058 --> 00:36:58,127
I can't imagine what the last
24 hours have been like.

555
00:37:01,299 --> 00:37:03,032
Are you okay?

556
00:37:08,139 --> 00:37:10,239
You came all the way up here
to check on me?

557
00:37:10,241 --> 00:37:12,775
Sort of.

558
00:37:12,777 --> 00:37:15,578
I was actually
already packing up my car.

559
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:18,181
When I heard
about the kimball fire.

560
00:37:18,183 --> 00:37:21,317
The thing is is that, um,

561
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:24,721
Last week, when I was
heading home from work,

562
00:37:24,723 --> 00:37:25,723
It just suddenly hit me.

563
00:37:29,427 --> 00:37:29,926
You are not the only one
who gets to decide.

564
00:37:29,928 --> 00:37:30,860
When it's "someday,".

565
00:37:30,862 --> 00:37:34,664
Because "someday" was
actually my idea,

566
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:37,000
So I should be the one
who gets to decide.

567
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:39,769
Yeah. Sure...

568
00:37:39,771 --> 00:37:42,472
And I get why you wanted
to stay in chicago,

569
00:37:42,474 --> 00:37:43,373
'cause I mean,
it's the same reason

570
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:45,842
I went back to springfield...
It's home.

571
00:37:50,115 --> 00:37:53,350
But then i...

572
00:37:53,352 --> 00:37:56,853
Heard about this opening.

573
00:37:56,855 --> 00:37:59,389
For a pediatric nurse at med.

574
00:37:59,391 --> 00:38:01,825
You're the one
who took the job at med.

575
00:38:01,827 --> 00:38:03,059
Yeah.

576
00:38:03,061 --> 00:38:06,029
Maggie told me you already
asked about it for me, though.

577
00:38:06,031 --> 00:38:06,897
Actually, I wasn't supposed
to tell you that,

578
00:38:06,899 --> 00:38:10,133
So if you tell her,
she will kill me.

579
00:38:17,576 --> 00:38:18,642
"There were doors
all around the hall,

580
00:38:18,644 --> 00:38:21,912
"but they were all locked,
and when alice had been

581
00:38:21,914 --> 00:38:24,081
"all the way down one side
and up the other,

582
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:24,915
"trying every door,

583
00:38:24,917 --> 00:38:25,983
"she walked sadly
down the middle,

584
00:38:25,985 --> 00:38:30,354
"wondering how she was ever
going to get out again.

585
00:38:30,356 --> 00:38:33,156
"Suddenly, she came upon
a little three-legged table,

586
00:38:33,158 --> 00:38:34,224
"all made of solid glass.

587
00:38:34,226 --> 00:38:37,728
There was nothing on it
but a tiny golden key."

588
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:38,162
"alice in wonderland."

589
00:38:38,164 --> 00:38:41,732
Yeah. Thanks.

590
00:38:41,734 --> 00:38:44,168
She was alice for halloween
every year until she was eight.

591
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:45,202
Yeah?

592
00:38:48,574 --> 00:38:49,006
Excuse me. You know
where lexi olinsky's room is?

593
00:38:49,008 --> 00:38:52,343
It's right here.

594
00:38:52,677 --> 00:38:53,744
Sergeant. Chief.

595
00:38:53,746 --> 00:38:58,449
Ofi has a conclusion. And?

596
00:38:58,451 --> 00:39:01,185
That fire was intentionally set.

597
00:39:01,187 --> 00:39:01,619
This was mass murder.

598
00:39:01,621 --> 00:39:04,388
Dr. Halstead!

599
00:39:04,457 --> 00:39:06,891
Gentlemen.

600
00:39:09,529 --> 00:39:12,496
Lexi. What's going on?

601
00:39:12,498 --> 00:39:13,397
Do something.

602
00:39:13,399 --> 00:39:14,031
Hey, watch out.
O2 sats are tanking.

603
00:39:14,033 --> 00:39:15,099
She's unable to oxygenate.

604
00:39:15,101 --> 00:39:18,836
Lexi! Hey, lexi! Lexi?
Al, come here. Come here.

605
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:22,006
Hey! Step out.

606
00:39:22,008 --> 00:39:22,473
Do something, man. Lexi!

607
00:39:22,475 --> 00:39:22,973
Al. Lexi!

608
00:39:22,975 --> 00:39:27,011
Al. Please!

609
00:39:27,013 --> 00:39:29,680
Get another blood gas,
drop her tidal volume to 300,

610
00:39:29,682 --> 00:39:32,283
Increase her rate to 25,
and up the peep to 10.

611
00:39:32,285 --> 00:39:34,619
Start paralytics.
50 of atricurium.

612
00:39:34,621 --> 00:39:36,854
Lexi...

613
00:39:36,856 --> 00:39:37,856
It's okay.

614
00:39:42,962 --> 00:39:44,482
Doc, doc, please...
Close that curtain.

615
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,966
Scissors.

616
00:39:52,605 --> 00:39:53,237
Her chest can't expand
to accommodate.

617
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:54,305
The breath from the vent.

618
00:39:54,307 --> 00:39:56,741
We need to release the skin.
Chest escharotomy?

619
00:39:56,743 --> 00:39:57,743
Yeah.

620
00:40:06,586 --> 00:40:07,586
Scalpel.

621
00:40:26,406 --> 00:40:26,938
Air pressures are coming down.

622
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:30,175
Sats are coming up.

623
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:33,111
All right.

624
00:40:33,113 --> 00:40:33,778
Al.

625
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:40,819
How's lexi? Is... is she okay?

626
00:40:40,821 --> 00:40:41,152
What? Tell me.

627
00:40:41,154 --> 00:40:44,389
Tell me.

628
00:40:44,391 --> 00:40:45,257
She's in critical condition.

629
00:40:45,259 --> 00:40:49,961
What?
She's in critical condition.

630
00:40:52,499 --> 00:40:56,835
Where is she? Okay, it's okay.

631
00:40:56,837 --> 00:40:59,371
Can I see her?

632
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,172
I need to see her.

633
00:41:00,174 --> 00:41:03,175
Hey, hey. I need to see her.

634
00:41:03,177 --> 00:41:04,009
This is meredith, lexi's mom.

635
00:41:04,011 --> 00:41:07,546
This is dr. Halstead,
jay's brother.

636
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:11,016
So lexi has burns
over 60% of her body.

637
00:41:11,018 --> 00:41:12,251
What?

638
00:41:12,253 --> 00:41:16,688
We had to make incisions in
the burned area of lexi's chest.

639
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:19,558
To improve her ability
to breathe.

640
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,995
I'll continue to update you
every step of the way.

641
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:25,697
And you're going to save her.
Please?

642
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:29,501
We're gonna do our best.

643
00:41:29,503 --> 00:41:33,072
Let the man do his job.

644
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,941
Come on.

645
00:41:35,943 --> 00:41:36,943
Take a seat.

646
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,547
Hey, take care of her.

647
00:41:41,549 --> 00:41:43,315
You take good care of her.

648
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,891
Hey.

649
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:59,098
Now you find whoever
set that fire,

650
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,333
And I want him alone.

651
00:42:11,045 --> 00:42:12,211
Detectives
and arson investigators.

652
00:42:12,213 --> 00:42:16,315
From across the city will not
rest until the individual.

653
00:42:16,317 --> 00:42:20,019
Or individuals responsible
are brought to justice.

654
00:42:20,021 --> 00:42:23,489
This cowardly act has robbed
many of our chicago citizens.

655
00:42:23,491 --> 00:42:24,490
Of their future.

656
00:42:24,492 --> 00:42:29,829
I'm being told that
the structure was a home.

657
00:42:29,831 --> 00:42:32,331
To many young
and talented artists.

658
00:42:35,003 --> 00:42:36,069
If those responsible
are watching this,

659
00:42:36,071 --> 00:42:39,305
They're about to feel
the full strength and scope.

660
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:42,075
Of the chicago
police department.

661
00:42:42,077 --> 00:42:43,077
Any questions?

662
00:42:47,515 --> 00:42:49,816
Stone. Hey.

663
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:50,650
Antonio.

664
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:51,484
The entire
state's attorney's office.

665
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:54,687
And investigators are at
your disposal.

666
00:42:54,689 --> 00:42:55,622
Good. What do you need?

667
00:42:55,624 --> 00:42:58,324
Just have your people
in felony review.

668
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:02,429
Ready to sign some warrants.
Done.

669
00:43:02,431 --> 00:43:05,165
Hey. I know
detective olinsky's daughter.

670
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:06,299
Is among the injured.

671
00:43:06,301 --> 00:43:08,802
But when I get this case file,
it's got to be legit,

672
00:43:08,804 --> 00:43:10,837
By the numbers and tight.

673
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:15,575
Hey, sarge!

674
00:43:20,983 --> 00:43:23,984
Hey, when we responded to
the call, this door was locked...

675
00:43:23,986 --> 00:43:27,454
So we thought...
So we just pried the door open.

676
00:43:27,456 --> 00:43:30,657
And you see these scratches?

677
00:43:30,659 --> 00:43:31,691
Whoever did this
when they exited...

678
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:35,629
They jammed these metal wedges
underneath the door.

679
00:43:40,803 --> 00:43:41,803
Excuse me a sec. Yeah.

680
00:43:45,207 --> 00:43:46,373
Chief lugo.
We have a task force assembled.

681
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:50,677
But I want you and intelligence
to run the investigation.

682
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:51,511
Understood. Right.

683
00:43:51,513 --> 00:43:55,315
Find the son of a bitch
who did this.

684
00:44:12,802 --> 00:44:13,534
I got a relief sergeant
to cover the front desk.

685
00:44:13,536 --> 00:44:17,071
So I'm here to help. Great.

686
00:44:17,073 --> 00:44:20,741
These are our 36 doas.

687
00:44:20,743 --> 00:44:24,378
And the 18 over there
are in the icu at med.

688
00:44:28,851 --> 00:44:31,552
All right, thank you.
All right, hey,

689
00:44:31,554 --> 00:44:34,355
That was a parole officer
in east garfield park.

690
00:44:34,357 --> 00:44:34,989
She has an ex-con
named nathan delano.

691
00:44:34,991 --> 00:44:38,058
Who did 18 years for arson.

692
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,059
And attempted homicide
in stateville.

693
00:44:39,061 --> 00:44:43,130
Because he lit his family
on fire back in 1998.

694
00:44:43,132 --> 00:44:44,031
Including three of
his own children.

695
00:44:44,033 --> 00:44:48,402
So this guy failed
to report in yesterday.

696
00:44:48,404 --> 00:44:49,437
She marked him down
for the violation,

697
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:52,506
But his last known address
was 4133 south wells.

698
00:44:52,508 --> 00:44:53,441
That's six blocks
from the kimball factory.

699
00:44:53,443 --> 00:44:57,511
There's a active warrant
out for his arrest.

700
00:44:57,513 --> 00:44:59,580
Yeah. Let's go.

701
00:45:20,403 --> 00:45:24,105
Nathan delano? Chicago pd!
Open up!

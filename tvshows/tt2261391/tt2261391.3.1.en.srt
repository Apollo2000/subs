Hinted I should wait another week,

176
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:04,251
but I am done staring at ceilings.

177
00:07:04,302 --> 00:07:05,769
Well maybe you should listen to them.

178
00:07:05,803 --> 00:07:08,021
I am 100%, Chief.

179

Any word from Severide?

182
00:07:20,118 --> 00:07:21,868
Hey, sorry, Chief.

183
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,587
I had an appointment that ran long.

184
00:07:23,621 --> 00:07:25,589
- Peter Mills.
- Hey, Gabby.

185

If I have special dietary concerns,

192
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:09,049
does the kitchen take that into account?

193
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,985
Uh, like, I don't like mushrooms.

194
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:15,272
Okay, I see. We will see you then.

195
00:08:15,323 --> 00:08:18,091
Some of these fancier places get offended,

196
00:08:18,126 --> 00:08:21,311
so I like to get it out in the open.

197
00:08:21,345 --> 00:08:23,847
What?

198
00:08:23,898 --> 00:08:25,982
Nothing.

Uh, yeah. That's me.

Sylvie Brett.

202
00:08:34,308 --> 00:08:38,912
I'm your new paramedic on 61?

203
00:08:38,963 --> 00:08:41,097
I'm sorry.

204
00:08:41,132 --> 00:08:42,966
Um... I've been partnered with Chout.

205
00:08:43,017 --> 00:08:46,203
I thought he was gonna be
assigned here permanently.

206
00:08:46,237 --> 00:08:49,206
I just go where they tell me.

207
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:54,094
Uh, yeah, well... Welcome.

Uh, take a seat.

210
00:09:02,371 --> 00:09:03,753
Again, I'm sorry I was late, Chief.

211
00:09:03,788 --> 00:09:04,788
Don't worry about it.

212
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:06,773
I want to thank you

213
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:10,944
sincerely for giving me these
last six weeks on the ambulance.

214
00:09:10,995 --> 00:09:13,830
I know you could've taken
your firefighter assignment and

215
00:09:13,881 --> 00:09:15,765
started at 105, but...

216
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:21,655
this house needed stability, and you...

217
00:09:21,706 --> 00:09:23,190
meant the world to me.

218
00:09:23,224 --> 00:09:24,708
Of course, Chief.

219
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:27,594
Always.

220
00:09:27,596 --> 00:09:29,112
Uh...

221
00:09:29,146 --> 00:09:32,115
so I'm letting you know

222
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:34,184
I am putting through your paperwork

223
00:09:34,218 --> 00:09:38,171
so you can resume your placement at 105.

224
00:09:38,222 --> 00:09:40,473
Oh, okay.

225
00:09:40,508 --> 00:09:42,142
Okay, good.

226
00:09:42,193 --> 00:09:44,160
- Thank you, Chief.
- Hmm.

227

How you doing, Gabby?

228

- Hey, Chief, thank you.

232
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,329
Um, I'm gonna get back to it.

233
00:10:02,363 --> 00:10:03,697

Great.

You and Donna want to carpool
over with Trudy and me?

237
00:10:09,171 --> 00:10:11,037
Uh, no. We'll meet you there.

238
00:10:11,072 --> 00:10:13,556
Groovy.

One more thing.

Just so it doesn't get uncomfortable

when the bill comes,

242
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:21,548
can we agree we'll go Dutch on this one?

243
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,049
You invited us, Mouch.

244
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,050
You made a big to-do about taking us out.

I know. I know.

But this is one of those fancy,

Nada.

254
00:10:58,786 --> 00:11:00,704
Didn't he have furlough stored up?

255
00:11:00,755 --> 00:11:02,772
A month, maybe.

256
00:11:02,807 --> 00:11:04,891
That ran out a week ago.

257

We've all left messages, but nothing.

258

they started with just
one restaurant in Dallas

in an old post office building.

269

And she'd say

the only thing that was holding
Molly's back was small thinking.

Yeah. I have.

Sir, I'm gonna need you to calm down, okay?

00:15:07,495 --> 00:15:09,296
I need you to try and relax, all right?

347
00:15:09,298 --> 00:15:11,481
I need you to take slow, deep breaths.

You know how to intubate a burn victim?

351
00:15:17,705 --> 00:15:19,389
I do. We just didn't have a ton of...

Watch.

353

For fire victims...

they get a lot of swelling in the trachea.

355
00:15:24,947 --> 00:15:26,963
So we knock them out with midazolam

Fine.

516

Let's make a record.

517
00:25:47,151 --> 00:25:48,401
A contract.

I am the master of working this thing.

523
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,115
Fine. Let's do it.

524
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:04,534
All right.

525
00:26:04,568 --> 00:26:07,553
The contract.

526

So, how did you end up here, Brett?

Mm.

Yes, it was that exciting.

I knew Harrison forever.

We went to elementary school together.

Our families knew each other.

We were supposed to get married
exactly three months ago today.

I stared at that abyss,

Hey, Mills.

548
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:07,263
I, uh, I didn't want to bother you

549
00:27:07,314 --> 00:27:08,481
while you were rehabbing,
but now that you're back...

Yeah, of course.

551
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,351
Look, I got a lead on
your paternal grandfather.

Okay.

No, my, uh...

My mother told me that his side
of the family moved to Seattle.

Wow.

Yeah, well, look. I got a family tree.

It's your dad's family.

Uh...

Can we, uh... just not order dessert?

No, not Zeppelin.

00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:33,155
Fastest way through the
Loop is Lower Wacker.

680
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:39,528
You and Antonio have been
seeing a lot of each other.

681
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:43,415
Yeah, it's... it's been
a rough patch for him, too.

682
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:44,867
I know.

683
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:47,953
I'm glad.

684
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:51,039
Hey.

685
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,908
He's your brother, but...

686
00:34:52,942 --> 00:34:57,546
if you need someone to talk
to you can always talk to me.

687
00:34:57,548 --> 00:35:00,182
Yeah, of course.

688
00:35:00,216 --> 00:35:03,218
Yeah, I'm... I'm...

689
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:04,887
I'm fine.

690
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:07,422
Truly.

691
00:35:07,457 --> 00:35:10,442
I'll see you back at the house later.

692
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:40,264
What are you doing, Mouch?

693
00:35:40,298 --> 00:35:42,049
Waiting on Chief.

694
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:46,220
We're supposed to double date tonight.

695
00:35:46,222 --> 00:35:49,890
I think he's been taking
what happened with Shay

696
00:35:49,941 --> 00:35:52,059
harder than he lets on.

697
00:35:52,061 --> 00:35:55,062
I've been going the extra
mile to cheer him up.

698
00:35:55,113 --> 00:35:57,197
Keep him busy.

699
00:35:57,232 --> 00:36:01,151
I just saw him heading
away on the other side.

700
00:36:02,153 --> 00:36:05,155
Really?

701
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:07,207
Huh.

702
00:36:12,914 --> 00:36:14,665
Donna, I can't do this.

703
00:36:14,716 --> 00:36:18,252
Yes, I have it. I feel like an idiot.

704
00:36:18,254 --> 00:36:20,220
A Zeppelin cover band with Mouch and Platt.

705
00:36:20,255 --> 00:36:23,257
Take my life, please.

706
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:26,393
Well right now I don't care

707
00:36:26,427 --> 00:36:29,429
if it's the happiest they've ever been.

708
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:34,985
Yeah.

709
00:36:35,019 --> 00:36:37,571
You're right.

710
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:43,827
Mouch.

711
00:36:43,862 --> 00:36:47,781
What time do you want us
to pick you and Trudy up?

712
00:36:47,783 --> 00:36:49,783
Really?

713
00:37:03,014 --> 00:37:05,032
Hmm.

714
00:37:12,607 --> 00:37:14,308
You know...

715
00:37:14,342 --> 00:37:18,111
you've been coming to see
me for five straight weeks,

716
00:37:18,146 --> 00:37:19,980
and for five straight weeks,

717
00:37:20,014 --> 00:37:24,017
you've sat on that couch and said nothing.

718
00:37:27,005 --> 00:37:29,706
Nobody's making you come here.

719
00:37:29,741 --> 00:37:33,660
Which means that you want to be here.

720
00:37:33,695 --> 00:37:36,663
Every counseling theory I know

721
00:37:36,698 --> 00:37:40,334
says that I should wait for
you to make the first move.

722
00:37:40,368 --> 00:37:43,303
That you'll tell me
what you want to tell me

723
00:37:43,338 --> 00:37:48,559
when you're ready to tell me.

724
00:37:48,593 --> 00:37:53,513
But I also know first responders.

725
00:37:53,515 --> 00:37:57,284
And we're a different breed.

726
00:37:57,318 --> 00:37:59,853
We have to do things

727
00:37:59,888 --> 00:38:02,890
whether we're ready or not.

728
00:38:12,283 --> 00:38:14,034
It's okay.

729
00:38:14,036 --> 00:38:15,035
I can wait.

730
00:38:15,037 --> 00:38:18,005
We traded places.

731
00:38:20,708 --> 00:38:23,710
We... We traded places.

732
00:38:26,314 --> 00:38:30,267
I told her...

733
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:34,187
I told her to switch with me.

734
00:38:34,222 --> 00:38:36,890
And she ended up right
where I was standing.

735
00:38:36,892 --> 00:38:38,558
Where I should have been

736
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,027
when the beam came down.

737
00:38:40,061 --> 00:38:46,066
[Cries]

738
00:38:48,736 --> 00:38:51,738
Oh.

739
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:57,744
[Sobbing]

740
00:39:17,899 --> 00:39:20,817
Hey.

741
00:39:20,852 --> 00:39:23,103
Good to have you back.

742
00:39:23,105 --> 00:39:24,821
Yeah.

743
00:39:24,856 --> 00:39:27,074
[Exhales]

744
00:39:27,108 --> 00:39:28,241
Come on.

745
00:39:28,276 --> 00:39:30,027
Let's do it.

746
00:39:34,282 --> 00:39:38,285
Her family will definitely
want some of this stuff.

747
00:39:42,123 --> 00:39:44,958
I can't stay here, man.

748
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,377
Why don't you stay with us for a while?

749
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:48,795
We got a spare bedroom.

750
00:39:48,797 --> 00:39:50,130
I don't know. I don't want to...

751
00:39:50,181 --> 00:39:51,131
It's done.

752
00:39:51,182 --> 00:39:52,449
As long as you want.

753
00:39:52,483 --> 00:39:54,017
[Exhales]

754
00:39:54,052 --> 00:39:56,053
Thanks.

755
00:40:16,524 --> 00:40:18,042

756

[Chuckles]

757
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,353
- Is it on?
- It's on.

758
00:40:30,388 --> 00:40:31,972
- Did you turn it on?
- Okay, shut...

759
00:40:32,006 --> 00:40:33,507
- Are you all right?
- Shut up.

760
00:40:33,558 --> 00:40:34,641
- [Laughing]
- Shut up, you idiot.

761
00:40:34,675 --> 00:40:35,642
- This is serious.
- Okay. Okay.

762
00:40:35,676 --> 00:40:37,511
Concentrate, all right?

763
00:40:37,513 --> 00:40:38,678
- The contract...
- Mm-hmm.

764
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,514
Rule Number One.

765
00:40:40,565 --> 00:40:43,133
We promise to never get
into each other's business.

766
00:40:43,167 --> 00:40:45,485
Oh, okay. I have... I have that recorded.

767
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,105
I know. That's why I just said it.

768
00:40:48,156 --> 00:40:50,774
[Chuckles] All right.

769
00:40:50,825 --> 00:40:52,526
Rule Number Two...

770
00:40:52,528 --> 00:40:53,860
no matter how much work gets to us...

771
00:40:53,911 --> 00:40:54,995
Mm-hmm.

772
00:40:55,029 --> 00:40:56,363
...we never bring it home.

773
00:40:56,414 --> 00:40:57,864
Good. Very good.

774
00:40:57,866 --> 00:40:59,049
Thank you.

775
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:00,050
- Okay.
- You know what?

776
00:41:00,084 --> 00:41:01,368
- Mm?
- That thing?

777
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:02,702
- Yeah?
- Here... Give it here. Your turn.

778
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:05,956
Give it here.

779
00:41:06,007 --> 00:41:06,957
- Here, here, you want some?
- All right.

780
00:41:07,008 --> 00:41:08,542
- Sure.
- Take it.

781
00:41:08,544 --> 00:41:13,547
All right, uh, we should also say that...

782
00:41:13,549 --> 00:41:15,382
no matter how much life gets to us

783
00:41:15,384 --> 00:41:16,516
that we shouldn't bring it to work.

784
00:41:16,551 --> 00:41:18,051
Because what we do

785
00:41:18,102 --> 00:41:19,803
is so much more important than all this.

786
00:41:19,854 --> 00:41:21,571
- Fair enough.
- An addendum.

787
00:41:21,606 --> 00:41:23,557
Got it.

788
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:26,393
Yeah.

789
00:41:26,444 --> 00:41:28,562
[Laughs]

790
00:41:28,564 --> 00:41:29,963
Is that it?

791
00:41:29,997 --> 00:41:31,364
Any other rules?

792
00:41:31,399 --> 00:41:32,649
Just one.

793
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,868
That we, uh...

794
00:41:34,902 --> 00:41:38,622
That we promise to be there for each other.

795
00:41:38,656 --> 00:41:40,874
Always.

796
00:41:40,908 --> 00:41:43,376
No matter what.

797
00:41:43,411 --> 00:41:44,961
Always.

798
00:41:44,996 --> 00:41:47,998
Always.

And that this is our guy.

330
00:15:54,302 --> 00:15:56,467
He's struck again.

331
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,702
So the woman in the car is Janet Powell.

332
00:16:07,398 --> 00:16:10,180
She's the mother-in-law
of our man, Larry Shepard.

333
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,663
We were looking at media targets,

334
00:16:11,727 --> 00:16:12,905

335
00:16:12,961 --> 00:16:15,544

We're hopeful.

338
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:21,108
I mean, if Shepard
requires more supplies,

339
00:16:21,185 --> 00:16:22,685
he's gonna have to reach out.

340
00:16:22,754 --> 00:16:25,020
I also got Antonio sitting
on George Lehr's house

341
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:28,057
in case he tries
to make personal contact.

No, you guys can pack up and go.

344

as you or your father,

but I seem to remember IEDs.

413
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:45,962
They require a certain amount
of practice

414
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:47,897
before someone deploys them
out in the wild.

415
00:19:47,966 --> 00:19:50,700
Yeah, theoretically,
the arsonist wants to test

416
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:52,135
the power of the explosives

417
00:19:52,204 --> 00:19:54,871
so they don't fall short
of their goal, I guess.

Right.

419
00:19:56,408 --> 00:19:58,808
So there might have been
a trial run or two.

Yeah. Go on.

Still he chose bombs, he chose fire,

- he didn't chose a gun.
- Mm.

So maybe that's something
that he built up to.

00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:03,399
<i>Chili, you were late this shift.</i>

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,469
- Like, five minutes.
- Chili! That's strike one.

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,006
Chili's on edge or something.

4
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:08,474
Off the rails is more like it.

5
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:10,009
<i>Whatever's going on with her,</i>

6
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:11,677
<i>I don't think
it's about us right now.</i>

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,312
- Oh, my God.
- Herrmann!

8
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:16,048
Freddie knifed me.

9
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,483
<i>I brought Freddie to
the fire house.</i>

10
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:19,418
- This is on me.
- Hey.

11
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,220
I'm not ready
to forgive that kid,

12
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:25,190
but I sure as hell don't blame
you for what happened, okay?

All right.

15
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,373
You sure you're ready for this?

16
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,175
Maybe you should
give it a few more days.

17
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:48,213
Cindy.
The doc said I'm ready.

18
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:51,450
- You were there.
- I know.

19
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:54,219
But Wallace told you to
take as long as you need.

20
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,119
You don't have
to rush right back.

21
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,457
I'm not rushing back.
I just...

22
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:06,198
Want to feel like myself again.

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,566
Come here.

24
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:15,441
- I love you.
- Love you.

25
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:23,549
Hey, guys!

26
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:30,756
So I'm back.
I passed my physical.

27
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,563
It's no big deal.
It's just...

28
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:40,265
Not like
I was on death's door...

29
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:48,440
Aw, you guys.
You didn't have to.

30
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,409
Oh, please.
I saw your face just now.

31
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:52,444
Come here.

32
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,746
I'm happy to have you home.

33
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:56,115
Good to be here.

34
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:57,649
You were missed.

35
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,218
Welcome back, buddy.

36
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,153
Chief, it's good to be here.

37
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:02,279
Good to have you back, Herrmann.

38
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,289
Hey, thanks, Lieutenant.

39
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,724
Hey.

40
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,259
- Buddy.
- So, hey.

41
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:08,694
When's your big day, buddy?

42
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:10,489
Oh, well, we haven't
exactly set a date yet.

43
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,429
We don't want to
rush into anything.

44
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,929
Yeah, of course, man.
You're young.

45
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,467
You got your whole life
ahead of you.

46
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,636
Why rush?

47
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,272
I see your sense of
humor's still intact.

48
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:22,374
That's too bad.

49
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:23,742
- Hey.
- Hey!

50
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,481
Look, I just, uh... I wanted
to say I'm sorry again,

51
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,679
you know, for what happened,

52
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,186
and bringing Freddie here
in the first place.

53
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:38,257
Listen, what I told you
in the hospital, I meant it.

54
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:40,692
You and me, we're good.

55
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:41,793
- Thanks.
- All right.

56
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,395
Oh, just so you know.

57
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,559
I talked to Kot, and he's gonna

58
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,959
push for the maximum
sentence for Freddie, all right?

59
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,336
Listen, Cindy, she's had me
on decaf the last few weeks,

60
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:54,299
so I'm gonna get myself a cup of
the real stuff before it's gone.

61
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,941
Uh, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, okay.

62
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:58,310
Hey, I'll let you know
if anything else comes up.

63
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,717
- What is it, Chief?
- I assume you two have heard

64
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,719
about the weather down south?

65
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,621
Yeah, I got an aunt
down in Carbondale.

66
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,089
She said a tornado hit
couple hours ago.

67
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,050
Well, I've just had an update
from the district chief.

68
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,389
They have no idea where
the storm is headed,

69
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,889
but the City's gonna be on tornado
watch for the next twelve hours.

70
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,759
They think a tornado
might hit here?

71
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,760
We have to be prepared,
just in case.

72
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,099
So make sure all
tools are checked,

73
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,769
fuel is topped off,
batteries fully charged.

74
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,500
- Yeah, we're on it.
- Good.

75
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,639
Hey.

76
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,609
So.
This is weird guy.

77
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,179
Pretending like nothing
ever happened between us?

78
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,980
It's not weird for me.

79
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,450
Okay, well, I know this is
gonna sound like a line,

80
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,759
but I hope that
we can still be friends.

81
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,920
Yeah, sure.

82
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,399
- Actually, no.
- What?

83
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,569
Why would I want
to be friends with you?

84
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,439
Just so you can feel better?

85
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,569
That's not what I meant.

86
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,700
I can't believe

87
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,769
that you actually
broke up with me

88
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,040
just because your
lieutenant told you to.

89
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,449
He just snaps his fingers and
you do whatever he says,

90
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,110
like a little puppy?

91
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,980
You said what you needed to say.

92
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,089
So the conversation
is just over, then?

93
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,820
Yeah.
Yeah, it is.

94
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,930
You're not even worth it.

95
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,229
Uh, you left your radio
in the common room.

96
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,600
Thanks.

97
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,609
Everything okay?

98
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,509
Yeah. All good.

99

103
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,589
- What's going on?
- Another tornado.

104
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,689
In Naperville.

105
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,959
That's like 30 miles away.

106
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,790

Okay, everybody, gather round.

120
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,869
As you've heard, we have a
potential tornado on our hands.

121
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,969
We're gonna take every
precaution to keep safe.

122
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,469
It's not even
raining anymore, Chief.

123
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,709
Actually, there's this YouTube
video of a tornado in Kansas;

124
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,310
sunshine in the west,
funnel clouds in the east.

125
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,019
- Pretty crazy, you guys.
- Thank you, Otis.

126
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,780
Orders are orders, people.

127
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,289
No one leaves the house
except on a call.

128
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,859
Perfect. Jimmy's got his
famous meat loaf on the menu.

129
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,589
Actually, I didn't get a chance

130
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,790
to pick up the groceries yet.

131
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,229
Okay, everybody
stay on your toes.

132
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,629
We have had weather before.

133
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,730
This thing comes for us,
we're gonna be ready.

134
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,870
Dismissed.

135
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,669
I'm gonna call Trudy,
make sure she's okay.

136
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,810
Yeah.

137
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,350
Hey, Austin.

138
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,249
Uh, yeah, we're fine.

139
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,889
Just on lockdown
till this thing passes.

140
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,350
I know.
Okay.

141
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,090
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.

142
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,799
Whoa.
Hey, you okay?

143
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,729
Yeah, yeah.
I'm fine.

144
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,930
I'm from Indiana, so been
through my share of tornados.

145
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,900
Right.

146
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,819
Looking good, Otis.

147
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,749
Am I?

148
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,820
Did you know that Brett was
still seeing that Austin guy?

149
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:12,059
Ah, he's picked her up from
the apartment a few times.

150
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,890
I don't know what
she sees in him.

151
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,160
You're still hung up on her.

152
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,030
No, I'm not.
That's just it.

153
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,239
It's not even about Brett.

154
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,000
Every girl does the same thing.

155
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,809
I'm a nice guy.
I got a good job.

156
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,939
I can bench 200 pounds.

157
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,179
- Otis.
- Okay, 150, regardless.

158
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,319
Without fail, the girl always
picks the other guy, always.

159
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,119
So shake things up.

- Huh?
- Give me some advice.

162

Yeah!

Yeah, take the kids
down to the basement.

what's really going on?

boyfriend in high school

197
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,419

Uh, on and off

209

Was anybody with her, know her
medical history, anything?

210
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,439
No, no, she was alone.

211
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,839
The news said to take shelter,
so we all just came back here.

212
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,209
All right, she doesn't have
a medical alert bracelet,

I'll start the IV,

214

- 10 milligrams.

219

- Yes.

220

the Valium and I accidentally

293
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,790
knocked over the morphine
and broke the seal.

Make sure.

322
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,780
No good.

323
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,359
Sir, sir, are you in charge?

324
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,289
I called 911.

325
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,489
You did good, kid.
Now let us do our job.

326
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,790
My parents are in there.
I came as quick as I could.

327
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,959
- How'd you get here?
- My bike.

328
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,829
I rode it from school.

329
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,899
Severide, any update?
We going in?

330
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,269
<i>- Negative, Casey.</i>
- My mother's in there,

331
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,270
and she's pregnant.

332
00:17:56,271 --> 00:17:58,539
Okay, okay, listen.
We're gonna get everyone out.

333
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,910
Okay? Thank you.

334
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold on.

335
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,549
Hold still.

336
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,520
I need a medical assist!

337
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,819
- All right, what's your name?
- Lucas.

338
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,460
Okay, Lucas, you got to
hold still for me, okay?

339
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,029
Must've hit him in the storm.

340
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,660
Broken window or something.

341
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,959
Hey, I'm Chili.
What's your name?

342
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,969
Lukas.

343
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,799
You have a piece of glass
in your back.

344
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,369
You're in shock... Your body's
protecting you from the pain.

345
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,000
- I don't get it, I don't...
- Hey.

346
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:36,609
Hey, you made it through
that storm to get here, yeah?

347
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,980
You can handle this.

348
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,880
- Kerlix and tape.
- I got it, relax.

349
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,689
Chief!

350
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,589
Doorways, window frames
are all out of square.

351
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:52,359
There's plaster, siding falling.

352
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,790
There's no sign of anyone, but
there's a basement downstairs.

353
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,499
Probably took shelter in there.

354
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,429
Building's too unstable
to use the front door,

355
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,999
but I did find another
entrance back behind that.

356
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,869
You move it with your
bare hands if you have to.

357
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,000
Okay.

358
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,380
Chief!

359
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,549
Come on, squad,
let's get that door open now.

360
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,849
Jimmy, Otis,
get that aerial in place.

361
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,119
Let's go.

362
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,019
May be electrical.
Severed wires.

363
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,319
The whole house was
ripped apart.

364
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,860
Let's just hope that the gas
lines haven't been cut.

365
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,890
Hey, guys,
give us a hand with this.

366
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,869
On my count, ready?

367
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,370
One, two, three!

368
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,710
Push!

369
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,380
One more!

370
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,620
Okay, okay, good!
Got it!

371
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,089
Okay, come on out, guys.

372
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,389
You all right?
All right.

373
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,929
Walk nice and easy.
Get out to the street.

374
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,929
Watch your step.

375
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,999
Come on, folks.
This way.

376
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,870
Away from the structure.

377
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,779
Get clear of that house, folks.

378
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,979
Watch your step.

379
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,679
Where's my husband?
I can't find my husband.

380
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,749
There's more people down there,

381
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,089
just hold on.
I'm sure he's coming.

382
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,049
He wasn't with us!
He went back for the dog.

383
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,719
Okay, well, they got to
be around here somewhere.

384
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,020
He was wearing
a yellow raincoat.

385
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,530
Ah...

386
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,830
I'm not sure, ma'am.

387
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,010
Guys, please
step back over there.

388
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,209
Hey.
You okay?

389
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,880
Yeah.

390
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,480
Hey.

391
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,849
Whatever you're feeling
right now,

392
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:01,789
I want you to put that energy
into this call.

393
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,489
Nothing else exists.

394
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,920
Yes, sir.

395
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,999
All right, guys, let's move.

396
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,469
I don't see my parents anywhere.

397
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,499
Okay, hold on.

398
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,500
What if they're still in there?

399
00:21:15,501 --> 00:21:16,969
Which one's their apartment?

400
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,100
That one.

401
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,509
Okay.

402
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,209
Guys, we got
two possible victims

403
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,809
in the apartment upstairs.

404
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,779
This building's a collapse
waiting to happen.

405
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,880
I'm only taking
one of you with me.

406
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,080
Herrmann, let's do it.

407
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:41,090
<i>♪♪</i>

408
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,570
Fire department!
Call out!

409
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,590
Let me see your face.

410
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,220
Crawl on out!

411
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,529
Put your hand on it!
Compress it!

412
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:16,760
Crawl out!

413
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,930
To the window!

414
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,859
- Two, three.
- Three.

415
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,020
Nice and easy.
There you go.

416
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,130
There you go, yeah.

417
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,129
Keep going, you got it.
I'm with you.

418
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,069
Go ahead.

419
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,330
We got you.

420
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,089
- Mom.
- Oh!

421
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,660
- Careful.
- Lucas.

422
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,959
Hey.

423
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,729
Check out the husband's head.
It could be serious.

424
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:23,930
Okay.

425
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,970
I'm so glad you're okay.

426
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,009
Nice work up there, Herrmann.

427
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,309
You get ahold of Cindy?

428
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,150
Nah. Not yet.

429
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,989
Hey, guys, mount up.
Let's take a ride.

430
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,190
Herrmann's house.
Turn on the siren.

431
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,299
They're gonna be fine.

432
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,960
Yeah. Yeah.

433
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,949
Hey, hey, hey.
It's okay.

434
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,279
All right, all right, all right.

435
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,419
Oh, I was so worried.

436
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,289
I know. Me too.

437
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:23,719
Annabelle flushed my damn
phone down the toilet.

438
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,919
It's okay.

439
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,959
They said that thing touched
down less than a mile from here.

440
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,829
- Yeah.
- Were you?

441
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,660
It's not good, but I'm okay.

442
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,010
Hey, I'd better get back.
You all right?

443
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,749
<i>The National Weather Service
has lifted the tornado warning.</i>

444
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,349
Copy. Hey.

445
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,749
City gave the all-clear.
Warning's been lifted.

446
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,150
All right.

447
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,120
Some day.

448
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,890
Hey.

449
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,959
Thanks.

450
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,830
Yeah. So... Big
plans after shift?

451
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,270
Ah... Hot date with Netflix.

452
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,819
You were right
about that Austin guy.

453
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,819
- Really?
- Won't leave me alone.

454
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,189
I told him I just wanted
to be friends,

455
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,019
and he keeps calling me.

456
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,289
Ah, so, you're not...
you're not seeing him anymore?

457
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:33,289
He's a boy, not a man.

458
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:35,329
Wasn't going anywhere.

459
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,930
Some people are just
incapable of change.

460
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,219
What happened isn't your fault.

461
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,959
You think I don't know that?

462
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,060
I wasn't the one with
the damn knife, was I?

463
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,799
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
You didn't deserve that.

464
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,899
No, forget it.

465
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,470
This isn't about me...
or Herrmann.

466
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,910
It's you I'm worried about.

467
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,989
Excuse me.

468
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,350
I'm looking for Wallace Boden.

469
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,860
- You found him.
- Chief Boden, nice to meet you.

470
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,829
- And you are?
- Alex Ward.

471
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,360
Homeland Security.

472
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,000
Come on in, shut the door.

473
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,569
Kelly Severide.
Agent Alex Ward.

474
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,909
Department of Homeland Security.

475
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,370
I was just asking your Chief
for some assistance

476
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,440
on an ongoing investigation.

477
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,049
- What kind of investigation?
- It's a domestic threat assess.

478
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:04,349
We've been tracking a residence
here in Chicago for some time,

479
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:07,819
trying to gather enough
evidence for a warrant.

480
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,150
What's that got to do
with the CFD?

481
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,459
The residence is
less than a block from

482
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,489
the apartment building
you responded to today.

483
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,059
I asked your Chief
if there was anyone

484
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,529
who'd be willing to go
down to the scene,

485
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,860
see if there's any structural
damage, a safety concern,

486
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,169
anything that could
get us inside the building,

487
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,470
under the radar.

488
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:29,540
You want me to kick down
a door, I'll kick down a door.

489
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,180
Hey, where's Chili?

490
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,950
I wouldn't know.

491
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,320
Everything okay between you two?

492
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,560
Yeah, yeah, sure.

493
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,630
Why?

494
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,139
'Cause you were staring
over her shoulder

495
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,140
on that tornado call today.

496
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,140
You can't tell anyone else.

497
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,510
Stays with me.

498
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,949
Back when I first started,

499
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:13,419
I had a kid with
a severe asthma attack.

500
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,150
I was so eager to help,

501
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,189
I didn't even look at
how much epi I drew up.

502
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:21,590
I ended up pushing
three times what he needed.

503
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,460
I cried in my chief's office
for half an hour afterwards.

504
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,099
- Confessed everything.
- Was he okay?

505
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,469
Yeah, yeah.
I was the wreck.

506
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:32,339
See, that's what scares me.

507
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,570
Everybody makes mistakes.

508
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,439
But if Chili doesn't
take this seriously,

509
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,940
she has bigger problems.

510
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,049
She's been erratic,

511
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:43,019
emotional for weeks now.

512
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,549
Maybe it's the Jimmy stuff,
I don't know.

513
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,289
You say anything to Boden yet?

514
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:50,489
No. Why?

515
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:53,989
You two are out there
on the streets alone.

516
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:56,259
You don't think your
partner has your back,

517
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,130
you can't do your job.

518
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,469
You got a second, Lieutenant?

519
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,070
Of course.

520
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,109
Funny thing about tornadoes,
they just drop out of the sky,

521
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:17,020
like some random act
you got no control over.

522
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,190
A lot of things do that to us.

523
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,320
Yeah, they sure do.

524
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:29,390
Hey, um... thank you for today.

525
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,629
Going into that home
and pulling that family out,

526
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,630
that's exactly what I needed.

527
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,670
Herrmann, you're the heart
and soul of this house.

528
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:43,109
Men here look up to you as much
as any chief in the CFD.

529
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,640
Don't ever forget that.

530
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,710
No kid, no knife...

531
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,180
not even a tornado
can take that away.

532
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,090
None of us are the same
when you're not you, Herrmann.

533
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,759
- Hey, go home.
- All right.

534
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,099
Kiss your wife and kids.

535
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,299
Yeah, that's a great idea.

536
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,069
Hey, uh, what did you
come in here for?

537
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,440
Exactly what I got.

538
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,070
Good night, brother.

539
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,349
Hey.

540
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,020
Oh, hey.
Just one second.

541
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,159
Um, do you want
to go get a sandwich?

542
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,489
The tornado warning's
been lifted,

543
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,699
and Jimmy's making meatloaf.

544
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,030
No, I'm good.

545
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,169
Chili, I'm trying
to talk to you.

546
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,639
About what?

547
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,469
That woman almost died today.

548
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,509
Yeah, but she didn't.

549
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:51,079
It was over in, like,
30 seconds.

550
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,579
You put her life in danger,
and then you lied about it.

551
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,710
It was a mistake,
and we handled it.

552
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,249
I handled it.
You froze.

553
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,590
Okay, if you want
the credit, it's all yours.

554
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:03,359
Hey, I'm going out
tomorrow night

555
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,389
with a couple of guys
from River North.

556
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,489
You want to come?

557
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,059
One of them's kind of your type.

558
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,759
- I'm good.
- Okay.

559
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,530
Your loss. Two-for-one
margaritas, just saying.

560
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,440
Sure you got the right place?

561
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,240
We don't believe this
was the primary residence.

562
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,510
More likely used for storage.

563
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,479
For what?

564
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,480
If what this guy's
planning goes off,

565
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:36,690
we're talking a lot more
casualties than a tornado.

Fire Department.
Anyone home?

567
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:46,229
These hinges look bent to you?

568
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,100
That window, it's sagging.

569
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,370
Makes this a public
safety concern.

We see heartbreak every day.

And we live our lives
imperfectly as a result of that.

You're a human being, Randy,

Glass was inches from the spine,
missed the lungs.

00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,990
You came for an apology, Joe.

647
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,700
I'ma give it to you.

648
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,270
I'm sorry.

649
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:41,270
<i>♪♪</i>

650
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:04,599
- What you saw today...
- I get it.

651
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,839
Don't worry.

652
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,840
Thanks for your help.

653
00:39:07,841 --> 00:39:10,070
You gave us a real advantage.

654
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,080
Hey, you need anything else,
let me know.

655
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,180
Thanks for the ride.

656
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,060
You got this, buddy.

657
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,869
20 bucks says he bails.

658
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,070
I'll take that action.

659
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,279
Guy was impaled by a stop sign?

660
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,679
You didn't tell me that.
That's messed up.

661
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,250
Oh, yeah.
Stuff hanging from the trees.

662
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,649
It was surreal.

663
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:52,949
Said on the news hundreds
of people were displaced,

664
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,090
putting them in shelters
all over town.

665
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,889
Whoa!

666
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,359
- Yeah?
- Otis, yeah!

667
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,830
Aah!

668
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,969
Oh, my God, you look great!

669
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,799
All grown up, yeah!

670
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,130
Whoo!

671
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,800
You okay?
You seem a little off.

672
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:17,339
Uh... House drama.

673
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,340
I'm worried about Chili.

674
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:21,309
She's been acting
erratic lately.

675
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:24,349
I'm not sure how much longer
Boden's gonna put up with it.

676
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,849
Really? Think he'd cut
her a little slack,

677
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:29,889
after all she's been through.

678
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:32,020
- What's that mean?
- Jelly Bean.

679
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,929
Chili's sister.

680
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,759
They found her body
a few weeks ago

681
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,160
in a flop house in Kansas City.

682
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,900
<i>I'm...
I'm not a rat.</i>

683
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,310
You did the right thing.

684
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,070
Did I?

685
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,340
I'll take it from here.

686
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:55,879
I... I wasn't trying
to get Chili in trouble.

687
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,080
I just want to...
I just want to help her.

688
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:01,850
Sometimes we have to bear
the consequences of our actions

689
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,920
to get the help we need.

690
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:08,290
And what are the consequences?

691
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,730
That'll be all, Brett.

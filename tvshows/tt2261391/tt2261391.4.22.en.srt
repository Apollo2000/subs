1
00:00:00,456 --> 00:00:02,291
We're dealing with a serious condition,

2
00:00:02,292 --> 00:00:03,841
called Immune thrombocytopenia.

3
00:00:03,851 --> 00:00:05,589
But he can still report to work, right?

4
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:06,903
Not right now.

5
00:00:06,913 --> 00:00:08,840
What would you think about us becoming

6
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,282
foster parents to Louie?

7
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:12,878
Gabby, we barely have
time for each other.

8
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:14,288
How are we going to
have time for a child?

9
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:15,824
I can't get him out of my head, Matt,

10
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:18,260
so I'm going to do it on my own.

11
00:00:18,261 --> 00:00:21,129
When I'm married, you break into my house

12
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,330
with flowers and champagne,

13
00:00:23,331 --> 00:00:25,333
and then I'm solo,

14
00:00:25,334 --> 00:00:28,336
and you keep a safe distance.

15
00:00:50,392 --> 00:00:53,241
Let's call furlough for
the next six to eight weeks.

16
00:00:55,664 --> 00:00:57,364
And go where?

17
00:00:57,365 --> 00:00:59,300
Right here.

18
00:00:59,301 --> 00:01:02,070
Never leave this spot.

19
00:01:18,086 --> 00:01:19,421
Mm.

20
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:25,627
All I'm saying is, I
could get used to this.

21
00:01:51,572 --> 00:01:55,177
_

22
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,601
Excuse me, I have to get going
to work. Is there any chance...

23
00:02:07,611 --> 00:02:10,761
Mr. Harvey's got several
people to see this morning.

24
00:02:10,826 --> 00:02:13,776
- Yeah, what about tomorrow?
- Meetings all day.

25
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:18,980
Look, I can give you a
call if there's an opening.

26
00:02:19,613 --> 00:02:21,772
You know, this isn't about me, right?

27
00:02:21,782 --> 00:02:23,318
There's a kid sitting somewhere right now

28
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:25,986
without a family, without a
place to call home, nothing.

29
00:02:25,987 --> 00:02:30,087
By the time the children reach us,
they're all that way, unfortunately.

30
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,693
Okay... yes,

31
00:02:35,694 --> 00:02:37,628
please give me a call
if you find time for me.

32
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:39,666
I appreciate it.

33
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:42,633
What kind of club?

34
00:02:42,634 --> 00:02:45,516
Oh, it's nothing fancy,
just a good DJ, cheap booze.

35
00:02:45,526 --> 00:02:48,006
- I need a favor from you, though.
- Of course you do.

36
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:49,774
The liquor license.

37
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:51,143
You wouldn't believe
the amount of hoop-jumping

38
00:02:51,144 --> 00:02:52,845
you've got to do to get one of those,

39
00:02:52,846 --> 00:02:54,979
but now that my little brother
works with an alderman...

40
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,104
No, not a chance.

41
00:02:56,114 --> 00:02:58,115
I wouldn't have come to you
if this wasn't important.

42
00:02:58,116 --> 00:02:59,917
I'm 15 grand deep.

43
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:01,786
I'm losing money every day.

44
00:03:01,787 --> 00:03:03,554
Jimmy, I'm serious.

45
00:03:03,555 --> 00:03:06,793
If I don't get this place opened
up, I could lose the house.

46
00:03:06,803 --> 00:03:09,961
Hey... could you restock the
4x4s? I think we're running low.

47
00:03:09,962 --> 00:03:11,350
- Hey, Danny.
- Hey.

48
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:16,634
Truck 81, Ambulance 61, car accident,

49
00:03:16,635 --> 00:03:19,171
2802 West 47th Street.

50
00:03:19,172 --> 00:03:21,006
I'll see what I can do.

51
00:03:32,418 --> 00:03:34,919
Mouch, Kidd, check out that smoke.

52
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,921
- Copy that.
- Watch the rig.

53
00:03:35,922 --> 00:03:38,457
Let's get these people out.

54
00:03:43,462 --> 00:03:45,797
Strike. Strike.

57
00:04:01,098 --> 00:04:02,098
Hey.

58
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,435
You okay?

59
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,507
Brett, let's get a C-collar over here.

60
00:04:09,508 --> 00:04:11,417
Okay.

61
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,713
Hi, I'm Sylvie. What's your name?

62
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:16,980
Kaylee.

63
00:04:20,316 --> 00:04:22,319
Hey, stand up.

64
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,420
Whoa.

65
00:04:23,421 --> 00:04:25,223
I'm gonna put this around your neck.

66
00:04:26,926 --> 00:04:29,528
- Does any of that hurt?
- A little.

67
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:31,595
Ugh.

68
00:04:31,596 --> 00:04:33,598
Wait. Stay there.

69
00:04:36,202 --> 00:04:38,235
You feel any pain in
your tummy or your chest?

70
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,937
- No.
- No?

71
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:43,007
- Yeah, she's loaded.
- Yeah.

72
00:04:43,008 --> 00:04:44,576
Wait there.

73
00:04:44,577 --> 00:04:46,211
What do we got?

74
00:04:46,212 --> 00:04:50,047
Mom and dad are sauced.
Had their kid driving.

75
00:04:50,048 --> 00:04:52,050
Good, good, good.

76
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:53,384
Ugh.

77
00:05:01,027 --> 00:05:03,246
Are they gonna... Are they...

78
00:05:03,256 --> 00:05:04,666
Oh.

79
00:05:05,273 --> 00:05:06,598
Brett.

80
00:05:11,137 --> 00:05:14,472
Jimmy, seat belt may have
given her a pulmonary contusion.

81
00:05:14,473 --> 00:05:17,975
Need the stethoscope.

82
00:05:17,976 --> 00:05:20,578
Diminished lung sounds on the left side.

83
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:23,114
- Damn it. She has a broken rib.
- Must have been the steering wheel.

84
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:24,583
She might have a punctured lung.

85
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:26,283
The trachea's deviated. She has a pneumo.

86
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,586
All right, let's trauma her to Med.

87
00:05:27,587 --> 00:05:28,920
I'll decompress her en route.

88
00:05:28,921 --> 00:05:30,254
All right.

89
00:05:34,092 --> 00:05:36,494
Kaylee, Mommy loves you!

90
00:05:36,495 --> 00:05:37,963
Yeah, real nice work, folks!

91
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:38,997
You put your daughter in the hospital!

92
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:41,932
Hey, hey, hey, come on.

93
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:43,982
Disgusting.

94
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,439
You all right?

95
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,141
The world's rough enough.

96
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:52,210
Your own parents shouldn't
be making it rougher.

97
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:53,410
I'm... I'm fine.

98
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:57,282
Just got my dander up, but I'm fine.

99
00:06:02,555 --> 00:06:04,155
What the hell are you doing here?

100
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:06,857
I'm on steroids. I'm not bedridden.

101
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:09,494
See, what I heard when they
said "medical leave" was,

102
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:10,738
"four weeks paid vacation."

103
00:06:10,748 --> 00:06:12,564
Yeah, shouldn't you be on a singles tour

104
00:06:12,565 --> 00:06:13,898
of Middle-earth or something?

105
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:16,867
Ha, yeah, I'm here to collect my check.

106
00:06:16,868 --> 00:06:18,869
Hey, Lieutenant, what's up? Hey, buddy.

107
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,073
You know, it's okay to
admit you... you miss us.

108
00:06:22,074 --> 00:06:24,910
- Who's on in relief?
- Malcolm Ferguson. You know him?

109
00:06:24,911 --> 00:06:26,076
- No.
- Oh.

110
00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:29,082
Ferguson, get over here!

111
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:40,525
Otis, Ferguson.

112
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:42,627
Ferguson, Otis.

113
00:06:42,628 --> 00:06:44,194
Great guy. You're gonna love him.

114
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,398
- Okay, yeah.
- Yeah.

115
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:48,533
H-hey, man, B-Brian.

116
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:50,434
Hey, hey...

117
00:06:50,435 --> 00:06:51,970
Hey.

118
00:06:51,971 --> 00:06:53,771
The Evanston guy. Yeah.

119
00:06:53,772 --> 00:06:56,074
Hey, so listen, that
thing that you did...

120
00:06:57,142 --> 00:06:58,276
You did.

121
00:06:58,277 --> 00:06:59,877
Oh!

122
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,045
You're the man.

123
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,112
Oh.

124
00:07:02,113 --> 00:07:04,882
Yeah, Connie handpicked
him herself, so...

125
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:05,930
- Connie?
- Yeah,

126
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,054
she's been keeping a list of
CFD's best floaters for Boden.

127
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,655
Had her eye on Ferguson for a while now.

128
00:07:11,656 --> 00:07:13,824
Real happy she finally
found a spot for him.

129
00:07:13,825 --> 00:07:15,627
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, temporarily.

130
00:07:15,628 --> 00:07:17,028
Uh-huh, yeah.

131
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:19,430
It's not like we got ourselves
a Wally Pipp situation here.

132
00:07:22,601 --> 00:07:24,196
Who's... who's Wally Pipp?

133
00:07:24,206 --> 00:07:26,170
First baseman for the 1925 Yankees.

134
00:07:26,171 --> 00:07:28,872
Took a day off with a headache,
got replaced with Lou Gehrig,

135
00:07:28,873 --> 00:07:31,876
who went on to play
2,130 consecutive games.

136
00:07:32,945 --> 00:07:35,213
But like I said, you're not him, so...

137
00:07:35,214 --> 00:07:38,449
Yeah, Connie... Connie
would never replace me.

138
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,651
Mm, absolutely not.

139
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:43,054
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

140
00:07:46,093 --> 00:07:48,862
- A child?
- Not just any child.

141
00:07:48,872 --> 00:07:51,722
We pulled him out of
the fire at north Dayton.

142
00:07:51,776 --> 00:07:52,854
I remember.

143
00:07:52,864 --> 00:07:55,266
Well, paperwork's done,
aside from a background check.

144
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:58,203
And I already started parenting classes.

145
00:07:58,204 --> 00:08:01,071
All I need is a letter of
recommendation from you.

146
00:08:01,072 --> 00:08:04,208
What are your chances of
qualifying, realistically?

147
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,077
Unlikely.

148
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,980
But "unlikely" doesn't mean "impossible."

149
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:13,151
And what if the boy gets placed
somewhere else in the meantime?

150
00:08:13,152 --> 00:08:15,997
I just want what's best for him,

151
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:19,225
whether that's me or
another foster family.

152
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:23,986
Where he is now, the group home,

153
00:08:24,113 --> 00:08:25,764
he deserves better.

154
00:08:25,765 --> 00:08:29,135
And I know I can give that to him.

155
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:32,888
I have to try.

156
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,174
I'll have the letter for you today.

157
00:08:39,245 --> 00:08:41,513
Thanks, Chief. Thank you.

158
00:08:49,621 --> 00:08:51,188
Hey.

159
00:08:51,189 --> 00:08:53,124
Hey.

160
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,959
I thought you were coming over yesterday.

161
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,126
I know, yeah.

162
00:08:56,127 --> 00:08:58,696
I just got a lot going on.

163
00:08:58,697 --> 00:09:00,633
And the day before that?

164
00:09:01,853 --> 00:09:05,036
I've been spending
every free moment at DCFS

165
00:09:05,037 --> 00:09:09,573
trying to find five
minutes to plead my case.

166
00:09:09,574 --> 00:09:13,577
This foster thing, it's moving forward.

167
00:09:19,818 --> 00:09:21,564
I don't mean for it to come
between us, Matt, but...

168
00:09:21,574 --> 00:09:23,668
But you're doing this.

169
00:09:24,816 --> 00:09:26,728
Yeah, I am.

170
00:09:28,303 --> 00:09:30,521
Okay, then...

171
00:09:32,231 --> 00:09:34,017
good luck.

172
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,335
Thanks.

173
00:09:55,754 --> 00:09:57,388
- Hey.
- Hey.

174
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:00,426
Can I get your opinion on something?

175
00:10:02,595 --> 00:10:05,296
Danny just bought this club,
and he wants me to help him

176
00:10:05,297 --> 00:10:06,563
get his liquor license.

177
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,700
The after hours thing in Bucktown?

178
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,664
- What do you mean after hours?
- Been up and running a few months,

179
00:10:12,674 --> 00:10:15,606
all cash, under the table.
He trying to take it legit?

180
00:10:15,902 --> 00:10:18,047
I guess. I don't know.

181
00:10:18,057 --> 00:10:20,613
He wants me to ask Casey for a favor.

182
00:10:22,347 --> 00:10:25,917
- I wouldn't.
- Nope, and that's what I figured.

183
00:10:26,344 --> 00:10:28,202
Anything else?

184
00:10:29,307 --> 00:10:31,157
Close my door, then.

185
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:38,897
Basically, DCFS just wants to
know that I'm not a criminal.

186
00:10:38,898 --> 00:10:40,764
I thought maybe you could
expedite the background check.

187
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,860
Shouldn't be a big deal.

188
00:10:44,314 --> 00:10:48,229
- Say something.
- What's Casey think about all this?

189
00:10:48,973 --> 00:10:50,741
I'm doing this alone.

190
00:10:51,115 --> 00:10:52,177
Why?

191
00:10:52,178 --> 00:10:55,400
Right now, this is more important
than my relationship, Antonio.

192
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,421
Gabby...

193
00:10:56,431 --> 00:10:58,351
What I need from you
is your support, okay?

194
00:10:58,361 --> 00:11:01,351
What I don't need is your permission.

195
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,192
I'll have the background check
for you by the end of the day.

196
00:11:08,193 --> 00:11:09,994
Thank you.

197
00:11:18,002 --> 00:11:19,571
Hey.

198
00:11:20,048 --> 00:11:22,472
I need you to clarify
a few things for me.

199
00:11:22,969 --> 00:11:23,975
Okay.

200
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:27,312
- You still in love with my sister?
- Of course I am.

201
00:11:27,313 --> 00:11:29,490
And you know about this foster situation?

202
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,029
Yeah.

203
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:34,518
Then why the hell is she
doing this on her own?

204
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:37,120
She made that call without me.

205
00:11:37,121 --> 00:11:39,332
Maybe because you've been
stringing her along for three years.

206
00:11:39,342 --> 00:11:41,359
All right, okay.

207
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,659
That's not even close to
what happened, all right?

208
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,710
You were supposed to marry her.

209
00:11:45,864 --> 00:11:47,831
Now she's out there taking
this thing on by herself.

210
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,200
I tried to talk to her.

211
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:51,869
That's where you screwed up, talking.

212
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,172
You either go get her and
make this right for good,

213
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:56,240
or you leave her the hell alone.

214
00:11:56,241 --> 00:11:58,308
You want to intimidate someone, Antonio,

215
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:00,010
take it back to the 21st.

216
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,312
If you're just giving
advice, then I can tell you.

217
00:12:02,313 --> 00:12:04,315
I don't want it.

218
00:12:24,718 --> 00:12:27,588
Gabriela, what are you doing here?

219
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:30,958
I'm... just trying to
get in with Mr. Harvey,

220
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,733
hoping he'll give me a chance.

221
00:12:32,743 --> 00:12:35,262
- Are you on shift?
- Yeah, on my way in.

222
00:12:35,263 --> 00:12:37,231
Just stopped by in case.

223
00:12:37,232 --> 00:12:40,501
- I know. It's a long shot.
- Single mom with a job like this.

224
00:12:40,502 --> 00:12:42,708
Are you sure you're ready to foster?

225
00:12:43,204 --> 00:12:44,960
Never been more sure.

226
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:48,876
We have a staff meeting later.

227
00:12:48,877 --> 00:12:51,178
I'll talk to Mr. Harvey,
see what I can do.

228
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:52,445
Thank you.

229
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:55,484
No promises.

230
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,994
Come on in, have a seat.

231
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:15,368
Gabby asked me for a letter
recommending her to DCFS.

232
00:13:15,369 --> 00:13:17,204
I wrote her a glowing review.

233
00:13:17,205 --> 00:13:19,498
- Thanks, Chief.
- Mm-hmm.

234
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:24,277
Unfortunately, I'm not sure
how far my words are gonna go.

235
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:27,281
This is a long, hard road.

236
00:13:27,665 --> 00:13:29,215
That's exactly what I'm afraid of.

237
00:13:29,216 --> 00:13:31,752
Yeah, we both know Gabby.

238
00:13:31,753 --> 00:13:35,756
- There ain't no turning back now.
- Yeah, she made that perfectly clear.

239
00:13:35,757 --> 00:13:36,957
Uh-huh.

240
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,959
Well, I believe everything
happens for a reason.

241
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,627
There's no way that I can send men

242
00:13:41,628 --> 00:13:43,430
running into a burning
building without knowing

243
00:13:43,431 --> 00:13:47,069
that there was some kind of bigger plan.

244
00:13:48,235 --> 00:13:52,473
You and Gabby, you've had a tough year.

245
00:13:52,694 --> 00:13:57,176
You've had your wins and your losses.

246
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:01,667
Then there's this newfound clout
that you have being an alderman.

247
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:10,891
Maybe there's a reason for that too.

248
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:18,564
Hey, been looking for you.

249
00:14:18,565 --> 00:14:22,136
Did you get a chance to talk to Casey?

250
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,936
Look, if you think I'm
bringing my Lieutenant

251
00:14:23,937 --> 00:14:25,738
into this, you are out of your mind.

252
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:28,541
- What?
- An after hours club?

253
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:30,176
That is illegal, Danny.

254
00:14:30,177 --> 00:14:31,444
You think you're in trouble now,

255
00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:33,213
try dealing with the
city if you get busted.

256
00:14:33,214 --> 00:14:35,748
I had to make money to
get the liquor license.

257
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,450
What did you want me
to do, sit on the place

258
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:40,020
while I'm getting bled dry
on rent not making a dime?

259
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:44,223
- I wanted you to be legit.
- That's what I'm trying to do.

260
00:14:44,224 --> 00:14:45,726
I'm drowning.

261
00:14:45,727 --> 00:14:47,560
I got Stacy beating me
up every five minutes

262
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:49,363
asking me why the checking
account is taking on water.

263
00:14:49,364 --> 00:14:51,564
This is because you rush into things.

264
00:14:51,565 --> 00:14:53,834
Are you gonna help me or not?

265
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,072
I'm not.

266
00:15:03,358 --> 00:15:04,944
Danny.

267
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,348
Hello?

268
00:15:09,349 --> 00:15:10,821
This is she.

269
00:15:13,357 --> 00:15:15,821
Sure, yeah, of course.

270
00:15:15,994 --> 00:15:17,605
Thank you so much.

271
00:15:20,594 --> 00:15:21,881
What's up?

272
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:24,330
Um... the DCFS guy,

273
00:15:24,331 --> 00:15:26,228
he agreed to meet with me.

274
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,894
That's amazing.

275
00:15:30,003 --> 00:15:31,939
Yeah, now...

276
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,747
now what the hell am I gonna say?

277
00:15:33,757 --> 00:15:36,542
The truth, how much you want this.

278
00:15:36,543 --> 00:15:38,722
You're gonna be great.

279
00:15:40,788 --> 00:15:43,404
- Matt, can I...
- Got you covered.

280
00:15:51,594 --> 00:15:53,160
You can't stay away, huh?

281
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,560
- Hey.
- What do you got?

282
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:57,364
Oh, a little insurance policy.

283
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:05,037
The theater?

284
00:16:05,038 --> 00:16:06,607
Connie loves musicals.

285
00:16:07,727 --> 00:16:09,329
Gah!

286
00:16:10,757 --> 00:16:13,642
You know what? I will not
be the Wally Pipp of 51.

287
00:16:13,652 --> 00:16:15,616
Mm? I'm not going down without a fight.

288
00:16:15,617 --> 00:16:17,117
Hey, that is good thinking.

289
00:16:17,118 --> 00:16:18,952
You know what? I didn't
want to say anything.

290
00:16:18,953 --> 00:16:23,290
But I did see a Form
2 on her desk earlier.

291
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,458
What?

292
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:26,593
Yeah, I mean, it's probably a transfer

293
00:16:26,594 --> 00:16:31,464
for one of those yahoos
on, you know... third shift.

294
00:16:31,465 --> 00:16:35,010
Yeah, yeah, but still, you
can never be too careful.

295
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,703
You're going with her to the show, right?

296
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,970
You think I should?

297
00:16:37,971 --> 00:16:39,030
- Heck yeah.
- Yeah.

298
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,674
You can't send a lady to
the theater without a date.

299
00:16:40,675 --> 00:16:42,321
Come on.

300
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,480
Yeah.

301
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,529
Stella?

302
00:16:51,185 --> 00:16:52,886
- Hey.
- Hey.

303
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,054
Hey, Grant.

304
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:55,610
What are you doing here?

305
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,624
I got your favorite,
corned beef from Manny's,

306
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,431
like I did when you were in the academy.

307
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:01,695
- Right.
- Right?

308
00:17:01,696 --> 00:17:05,231
Right, um... let's go outside.

309
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,889
- Let's go talk.
- Oh... okay.

310
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:08,136
Yeah. Come on.

311
00:17:08,146 --> 00:17:10,636
Hey, is that the dude
who left me high and dry

312
00:17:10,637 --> 00:17:13,340
- on my kid's birthday?
- Uh-huh.

313
00:17:13,341 --> 00:17:15,243
He looks like a mess.

314
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,547
- What are you doing here, Grant?
- We're playing a gig this weekend.

315
00:17:21,548 --> 00:17:23,516
- We're playing.
- Okay.

316
00:17:23,517 --> 00:17:24,944
- You're the one to thank for that.
- Look...

317
00:17:24,954 --> 00:17:27,019
I mean, you got me back
into it just when I was

318
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,221
this close to pulling the
plug on the whole thing.

319
00:17:29,222 --> 00:17:30,891
- Grant...
- No, no, Stella, I mean it.

320
00:17:30,892 --> 00:17:32,159
It's you.

321
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,493
You know, you're my inspiration.

322
00:17:33,494 --> 00:17:35,062
You've always been my muse.

323
00:17:35,063 --> 00:17:36,595
You got to be there. You have to come.

324
00:17:36,596 --> 00:17:38,064
Kurt says the place is gonna be packed.

325
00:17:38,065 --> 00:17:40,334
- Have you slept?
- Yeah. No.

326
00:17:40,335 --> 00:17:42,702
I'm... I've been up all night writing.

327
00:17:42,703 --> 00:17:43,903
You know how it is, and just

328
00:17:43,904 --> 00:17:45,939
whatever was missing,
it's now back, you know.

329
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,174
I'm back. I'm back. The
songs are coming out of me.

330
00:17:48,175 --> 00:17:49,543
I couldn't stop it if I tried.

331
00:17:49,544 --> 00:17:52,179
Just... just... just...
You'll see, all right?

332
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,680
The first song is for you.

333
00:17:53,681 --> 00:17:56,083
You inspired it, "Stella Bella."

334
00:17:56,084 --> 00:17:59,719
Be there, baby. Here, your corned beef.

335
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,455
- Take it, enjoy.
- Thank you.

336
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:04,458
Baby, baby, Stella, I love you.

337
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,901
Firefighter.

338
00:18:14,902 --> 00:18:16,303
Yes, sir.

339
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:19,633
They say if we show up, it's
probably the worst day of your life.

340
00:18:19,643 --> 00:18:21,076
I know it was for Louie.

341
00:18:21,077 --> 00:18:24,281
Wish I could say the
same, but the truth is,

342
00:18:24,282 --> 00:18:27,750
these children typically
experience a fair share of trauma.

343
00:18:27,751 --> 00:18:30,260
- Are you prepared for that?
- Yes, sir.

344
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:35,057
I know that trauma can lead
to emotional problems and...

345
00:18:35,058 --> 00:18:38,327
distress, acting out.

346
00:18:38,328 --> 00:18:40,663
My eyes are wide open.

347
00:18:40,664 --> 00:18:44,064
And I know it won't be easy,
but when I look at this kid,

348
00:18:45,962 --> 00:18:47,670
I don't see all the problems.

349
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:50,539
I see everything he could become

350
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,142
if someone would just give him a chance.

351
00:18:55,145 --> 00:18:58,614
- What's his name again?
- Louie. Louie Thompson.

352
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:05,188
Look at this.

353
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:26,372
Hey, how'd it go?

354
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,675
Uh...

355
00:19:28,676 --> 00:19:31,210
not gonna work out.

356
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:34,413
He got placed with another foster family.

357
00:19:34,414 --> 00:19:36,115
Happened this morning.

358
00:19:36,116 --> 00:19:37,284
That's a raw deal.

359
00:19:37,285 --> 00:19:39,319
You would have been a
better parent than 99%

360
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,220
of the folks that we see out there.

361
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,524
Nah, it's okay. It's
good... it's good news.

362
00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:45,458
I just want him to be happy.

363
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:48,195
- Mm.
- Hey, what's going on?

364
00:19:48,196 --> 00:19:49,530
Hey.

365
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:54,066
Uh...

366
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,067
the meeting didn't go so well.

367
00:19:57,805 --> 00:19:59,540
Oh, Gabby, I'm really sorry.

368
00:20:02,442 --> 00:20:05,245
Truck 81, Squad 3, Ambulance 61,

369
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:08,681
building collapse, 422 North May Street.

370
00:20:11,058 --> 00:20:13,253
- Want to sit this one out?
- I'm fine.

371
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,354
You sure? 'Cause we
can manage without you.

372
00:20:15,355 --> 00:20:17,890
I'm fine.

373
00:20:17,891 --> 00:20:19,059
Okay.

374
00:20:32,506 --> 00:20:34,841
- You the incident commander?
- Uh-huh.

375
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:36,610
Fourth story was under renovation
when the floor collapsed.

376
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,178
A couple construction
guys already got out.

377
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:41,951
- Is the third floor occupied?
- Small business, 20 to 30 employees,

378
00:20:41,961 --> 00:20:43,249
most of them still inside.

379
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,851
It's your call, Chief.

380
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:46,419
Okay, get your guys ready.

381
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,921
Send a small search team
to limit the impact load.

382
00:20:48,922 --> 00:20:50,791
This building's a
collapse about to happen.

383
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:53,293
Got it. I'll make sure
the guys from 67 are ready.

384
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:56,295
All right, we have 20-plus victims inside.

385
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,864
The only thing holding this
building up is God and carpeting.

386
00:20:58,865 --> 00:21:01,200
That is, no SCBAs or no power tools.

387
00:21:01,201 --> 00:21:03,669
Lessen the load. Watch your step.

388
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,806
When I say "get out," I mean it.

389
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,088
Let's go.

390
00:21:12,447 --> 00:21:14,546
Hey, Danny.

391
00:21:15,115 --> 00:21:16,617
Danny.

392
00:21:18,753 --> 00:21:20,250
Jimmy, come on.

393
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:32,466
- Take the right.
- Got it.

394
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:34,434
Ma'am, ma'am, this way.

395
00:21:34,435 --> 00:21:36,236
Please, hey, do not run.

396
00:21:36,237 --> 00:21:40,608
Walk to the exit, please.
Ma'am, come on. Keep moving.

397
00:21:44,445 --> 00:21:45,845
Check him out.

398
00:21:52,487 --> 00:21:54,428
No, he's gone.

399
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:56,756
Take it easy, easy. There you go.

400
00:21:56,757 --> 00:21:58,856
Hey, let's check that void
space before the load shifts.

401
00:21:58,866 --> 00:22:00,326
Tight, tread lightly.

402
00:22:00,327 --> 00:22:02,528
Don't even breathe.

403
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,398
Hey, hey, hey, hey, my
boss, she's still in there.

404
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:05,899
Help me.

405
00:22:06,365 --> 00:22:08,050
Go for it.

406
00:22:08,835 --> 00:22:11,004
Right there.

407
00:22:11,005 --> 00:22:13,640
Fire department! Call out!

408
00:22:13,641 --> 00:22:15,976
Here. Over here.

409
00:22:15,977 --> 00:22:17,256
Go.

410
00:22:17,702 --> 00:22:19,012
Call out.

411
00:22:19,013 --> 00:22:21,515
What happened? Was there a bomb?

412
00:22:21,516 --> 00:22:23,717
Construction accident. We got
to get you out of here now.

413
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:25,552
It's not safe.

414
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:28,088
Come with me through here. Come on.

415
00:22:30,227 --> 00:22:31,766
I can't.

416
00:22:32,412 --> 00:22:33,893
I can't.

417
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:38,598
I'm scared.

418
00:22:38,888 --> 00:22:40,828
You got this.

419
00:22:41,201 --> 00:22:44,737
You're going home. You hear me?

420
00:22:50,644 --> 00:22:52,946
Come on, keep moving.

421
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:06,399
- Here.
- Oh, I found one.

422
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:09,696
Relax, dude, we're gonna
get you out of here, okay?

423
00:23:09,697 --> 00:23:11,430
You did great. Come on.

424
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:12,998
Ow!

425
00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:16,002
Just stay calm, all right?
We're gonna get you out.

426
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:18,314
All right, nice and easy.

427
00:23:18,324 --> 00:23:22,092
On my count... one, two, three.

428
00:23:28,548 --> 00:23:31,118
Slide her under, Joe.

429
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,320
Good. All right.

430
00:23:33,321 --> 00:23:35,155
All right, come on, hon. Come on.

431
00:23:35,156 --> 00:23:36,555
- Oh!
- We got you.

432
00:23:36,556 --> 00:23:38,390
Thank you. Oh, thank you.

433
00:23:38,391 --> 00:23:39,892
- All right, brother, come on.
- All right, hurry up.

434
00:23:39,893 --> 00:23:41,128
We got you. Come on.

435
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:42,963
There we go. Come on.

436
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:45,165
Come on. Good, there you go.

437
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,636
Aah! My leg!

438
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:52,438
I got you. All right, come on.

439
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:54,107
I got you. Come on.

440
00:23:54,108 --> 00:23:55,676
Got him.

441
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,782
Oh, oh, thank... thank you.

442
00:24:01,783 --> 00:24:03,185
Squeeze on out.

443
00:24:05,585 --> 00:24:07,197
Medic!

444
00:24:08,756 --> 00:24:12,691
Got multiple fractures on his left leg.

445
00:24:12,692 --> 00:24:14,060
- All right.
- You got this?

446
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:15,428
Yeah.

447
00:24:15,429 --> 00:24:17,264
Augh!

448
00:24:20,352 --> 00:24:23,536
Hey, Chief, this building
hasn't got much time left,

449
00:24:23,537 --> 00:24:24,871
a minute, maybe two.

450
00:24:24,872 --> 00:24:26,206
Okay.

451
00:24:30,945 --> 00:24:33,615
Get away from the building!

452
00:24:33,961 --> 00:24:36,515
That's it. Emergency! Emergency!

453
00:24:36,525 --> 00:24:38,083
Evacuate the building now.

454
00:24:38,084 --> 00:24:41,254
All firefighters, evacuate
the building immediately.

455
00:24:41,255 --> 00:24:42,621
All right, you heard him!

456
00:24:42,622 --> 00:24:44,024
Let's clear out!

457
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:45,225
Everyone out!

458
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:53,377
- We get everyone?
- Our side's clear!

459
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,974
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, you hear that?
- Come on, we got to go.

460
00:24:58,984 --> 00:25:01,341
67 Borrelli to Battalion 25.

461
00:25:01,342 --> 00:25:03,810
I got someone up here, Chief. I
need more time to bring him out.

462
00:25:03,811 --> 00:25:07,746
There is no more time. Evacuate now.

463
00:25:07,747 --> 00:25:09,949
I can't leave anyone behind, Chief.

464
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:16,823
Then bring him out. You
have one minute, no more.

465
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,394
Come on, get out.

466
00:25:23,797 --> 00:25:25,798
Come on.

467
00:25:28,803 --> 00:25:32,207
Everybody, get back!

468
00:25:37,311 --> 00:25:38,978
Everybody get back.

469
00:25:45,151 --> 00:25:47,152
Borrelli!

470
00:25:57,331 --> 00:25:58,789
Danny!

471
00:26:00,094 --> 00:26:01,487
Anybody!

472
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:10,989
Danny.

473
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:12,845
Danny.

474
00:26:14,511 --> 00:26:15,979
Danny!

475
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:24,354
Danny.

476
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,662
Just relax... we're gonna
find a way out of here for you.

477
00:26:32,663 --> 00:26:34,797
Who saw him last? Where was he?

478
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:36,333
He went back into the bullpen.

479
00:26:36,334 --> 00:26:38,434
It's back left, where
the collapse started.

480
00:26:38,435 --> 00:26:40,437
Is there any chance that
Jimmy could get up there?

481
00:26:40,438 --> 00:26:44,406
If the stairs are intact.

482
00:26:51,449 --> 00:26:53,549
Battalion 25, this is Borrelli.

483
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,553
Um... I found him.

484
00:26:56,554 --> 00:26:59,355
Requesting backup to extract.

485
00:26:59,356 --> 00:27:01,024
Borrelli, where are you?

486
00:27:01,025 --> 00:27:03,293
10 yards from the bullpen entrance.

487
00:27:03,294 --> 00:27:06,095
Debris is completely blocking the area.

488
00:27:06,096 --> 00:27:10,299
Requesting squad for
assistance to help extract.

489
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,435
- Squad, let's go!
- No. Stay where you are.

490
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,456
That place is a death trap.
I'm not risking anybody else.

491
00:27:16,466 --> 00:27:19,041
Battalion 25, do you copy?

492
00:27:21,045 --> 00:27:24,314
Squad, do you copy?

493
00:27:24,315 --> 00:27:26,615
Chief, just send me.

494
00:27:44,734 --> 00:27:46,702
Okay, stay with me.

495
00:27:46,703 --> 00:27:52,061
Okay, just stay calm,
nice shallow, easy breaths.

496
00:27:53,044 --> 00:27:55,679
You didn't have to come back for me.

497
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,548
You did it for a complete stranger.

498
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:01,817
There's no one here.

499
00:28:01,818 --> 00:28:04,820
I thought I heard...

500
00:28:05,238 --> 00:28:07,257
You were doing your job.

501
00:28:12,583 --> 00:28:15,565
Danny, you hold on for me.

502
00:28:15,566 --> 00:28:16,866
It's okay.

503
00:28:16,867 --> 00:28:20,002
Augh. Aah! Aah!

504
00:28:20,003 --> 00:28:21,037
Augh.

505
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:22,471
Augh!

506
00:28:22,472 --> 00:28:23,672
- Borrelli.
- No!

507
00:28:23,673 --> 00:28:25,275
- No!
- Come on.

508
00:28:25,276 --> 00:28:26,710
- Come on, we have to go.
- No!

509
00:28:26,711 --> 00:28:28,746
We need to go now.

510
00:28:37,962 --> 00:28:41,532
Detail, atten-hut.

511
00:28:44,769 --> 00:28:47,772
Present arms.

512
00:29:59,396 --> 00:30:01,745
Order arms.

513
00:30:05,749 --> 00:30:07,750
Fall out.

514
00:30:25,402 --> 00:30:27,750
I did not save lives today.

515
00:30:31,189 --> 00:30:32,637
You did.

516
00:30:34,348 --> 00:30:35,923
All of you.

517
00:30:37,812 --> 00:30:41,217
That does not make the loss
of one of our own any easier.

518
00:30:44,623 --> 00:30:49,093
The nature of this job is
that sometimes we are the ones

519
00:30:49,468 --> 00:30:51,360
who don't make it home.

520
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,625
We all signed up for that.

521
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:12,240
Every time we roll out of those doors,
we know that it could be our last call.

522
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,873
This house has your back.

523
00:32:11,102 --> 00:32:13,243
You give us a call any time.

524
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:17,046
We'll be on our way before
you hang up the phone.

525
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:20,049
Take all the time you need.

526
00:32:20,311 --> 00:32:22,924
No one's marking down furlough.

527
00:32:24,356 --> 00:32:28,057
Casey and I will be at your
place first thing in the morning,

528
00:32:28,373 --> 00:32:30,893
help out with any arrangements.

529
00:32:30,894 --> 00:32:33,529
Be with your family, Borrelli.

530
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,164
Reach out to the chaplain if you need,

531
00:32:35,165 --> 00:32:38,593
but don't go through this alone.

532
00:32:44,604 --> 00:32:46,854
Come on. I'll give you a ride home.

533
00:32:54,219 --> 00:32:55,352
What happened?

534
00:32:55,353 --> 00:32:58,122
There were behavioral
problems, aggression.

535
00:32:58,123 --> 00:33:01,691
He was lashing out
physically, hitting, biting.

536
00:33:01,692 --> 00:33:04,461
So they sent him back? They
can... they can just do that?

537
00:33:04,471 --> 00:33:06,997
Well, the family has other children.
They were worried for their safety.

538
00:33:06,998 --> 00:33:08,564
He's three years old.

539
00:33:08,565 --> 00:33:10,734
They were trying to do the right thing.

540
00:33:14,595 --> 00:33:16,006
How is he?

541
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:18,976
He's been asking for you.

542
00:33:18,977 --> 00:33:22,014
I thought it might finally calm him down.

543
00:33:33,737 --> 00:33:35,312
Hey, Louie.

544
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,179
Thank you.

545
00:34:07,473 --> 00:34:08,885
He's asleep.

546
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,024
You're a lifesaver.

547
00:34:13,981 --> 00:34:15,657
Anyway, it's late.

548
00:34:16,768 --> 00:34:19,661
Look, I'm not supposed to tell you this,

549
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:22,639
but there's still a chance.

550
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,870
With Louie back here,
you've got a shot again.

551
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:33,943
You two have a connection. I
won't let that go unnoticed.

552
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:37,469
Thank you.

553
00:34:39,323 --> 00:34:42,492
Harvey likes you.

554
00:34:42,493 --> 00:34:44,160
The Alderman may have
gotten you in the door,

555
00:34:44,161 --> 00:34:46,692
but whatever you said in there...

556
00:34:48,209 --> 00:34:50,434
I'm sorry, the...

557
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,436
the Alderman?

558
00:34:52,779 --> 00:34:54,905
Alderman Casey.

559
00:34:58,143 --> 00:35:01,410
Apparently, he pulled some
strings to get you that meeting.

560
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:18,189
Hey, you heard from Borrelli?

561
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,062
He won't return my calls.

562
00:35:20,072 --> 00:35:22,269
Not since he left 51.

563
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:25,805
- You hear from him, you let me know.
- Yeah, sure.

564
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,218
On the house, guys.

565
00:35:40,355 --> 00:35:41,715
What?

566
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,692
It's been a hell of a week.

567
00:35:45,694 --> 00:35:48,394
Hey, speaking of hell,

568
00:35:48,395 --> 00:35:51,398
how do you think Otis
is doing right about now?

569
00:35:56,371 --> 00:35:57,671
M'lady.

570
00:35:57,672 --> 00:35:59,865
Champagne. That is so sweet.

571
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:03,343
Well, you work so hard, you
deserve a little spoiling.

572
00:36:08,451 --> 00:36:10,187
Oh, you know, I've been
meaning to talk to you

573
00:36:10,197 --> 00:36:13,188
about that whole relief situation.

574
00:36:14,623 --> 00:36:17,724
You know, you bringing
in Ferguson to replace me.

575
00:36:17,725 --> 00:36:19,425
Connie...

576
00:36:19,426 --> 00:36:22,690
- I've been at 51 for going on...
- What are you talking about?

577
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,600
Herrmann and Mouch, you know,
they told me, and they said...

578
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:30,105
Your spot is safe at 51,
Brian, always has been.

579
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:32,405
- Yeah, but...
- Oh, wait.

580
00:36:32,406 --> 00:36:34,269
Shh, shh, shh, shh. Here we go.

581
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,057
Hey, stranger.

582
00:36:51,058 --> 00:36:52,251
Hey.

583
00:36:52,898 --> 00:36:56,030
So... about the other day,

584
00:36:56,031 --> 00:36:59,399
I know that you saw Grant stop by 51.

585
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,638
It's all good.

586
00:37:00,648 --> 00:37:04,037
Well, no, no, it's not.

587
00:37:04,038 --> 00:37:07,499
I mean, we're not back together,
if that's what you think.

588
00:37:07,509 --> 00:37:09,709
It's none of my business.

589
00:37:11,045 --> 00:37:14,782
It's just, he's... he's using again.

590
00:37:14,783 --> 00:37:16,216
He's got glassy eyes.

591
00:37:16,217 --> 00:37:19,385
Looks like he's been up
for days "writing music,"

592
00:37:19,386 --> 00:37:22,021
same thing he used to say
before he'd go off on a bender,

593
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:24,557
and I'm worried,

594
00:37:24,558 --> 00:37:27,695
and... that's it.

595
00:37:27,696 --> 00:37:30,396
So, just wanted you to know.

596
00:37:30,397 --> 00:37:32,247
We'll figure it out.

597
00:37:32,766 --> 00:37:34,381
Okay.

598
00:37:35,273 --> 00:37:37,805
You're awfully quiet. What's going on?

599
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:40,774
I shouldn't talk about it.

600
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:42,108
Should.

601
00:37:42,109 --> 00:37:44,445
You should talk about it.

602
00:37:45,779 --> 00:37:49,015
I might actually have a
shot with Louie after all.

603
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,917
- What?
- Yeah.

604
00:37:50,918 --> 00:37:52,785
I mean, I'd have to find
another place to live.

605
00:37:52,786 --> 00:37:54,722
Otherwise, it's both of us
going through the approval.

606
00:37:54,723 --> 00:37:56,756
Oh, no, no, of course.

607
00:37:56,757 --> 00:37:58,524
I mean, with everything
that's going on around here,

608
00:37:58,525 --> 00:38:00,660
we could all use some good news.

609
00:38:00,661 --> 00:38:03,664
It's okay to be happy.

610
00:38:08,669 --> 00:38:10,363
I'll be right back.

611
00:38:20,067 --> 00:38:22,548
You think I wasn't gonna find out?

612
00:38:24,918 --> 00:38:29,733
You're the reason that I
got that meeting at DCFS.

613
00:38:29,743 --> 00:38:32,579
Just helping out a deserving constituent.

614
00:38:32,715 --> 00:38:34,995
Mm, right.

615
00:38:34,996 --> 00:38:36,448
Something change?

616
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:40,135
It's... it's too soon to tell, but...

617
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,470
I might have a chance, yeah.

618
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,805
That's 'cause of you.

619
00:38:53,815 --> 00:38:55,816
Thank you.

620
00:38:57,951 --> 00:38:59,174
Yeah.

621
00:39:19,674 --> 00:39:20,941
Yeah.

622
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,296
Hey.

623
00:39:23,178 --> 00:39:26,180
You said if I needed anything...

624
00:39:26,181 --> 00:39:28,216
Yeah.

625
00:39:30,923 --> 00:39:33,788
I can't stop going
over it in my head, man.

626
00:39:35,063 --> 00:39:38,158
There's something that the Chief said.

627
00:39:38,331 --> 00:39:39,959
Um...

628
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,562
and I can't help but think why.

629
00:39:45,065 --> 00:39:48,468
"One more minute."

630
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,472
When everyone else was coming out, why...

631
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:53,941
why did he tell Danny that he had time?

632
00:39:53,942 --> 00:39:58,144
I can tell you, Chief never
makes a decision lightly.

633
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,379
And he did what he thought was best.

634
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,148
He was wrong, though. He was dead wrong!

635
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,617
Jimmy, Jimmy, listen to me.

636
00:40:03,618 --> 00:40:05,452
Don't go down this road.

637
00:40:05,453 --> 00:40:07,954
It doesn't lead anywhere good.

638
00:40:10,525 --> 00:40:13,427
- Okay.
- Look, you need any...

639
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,601

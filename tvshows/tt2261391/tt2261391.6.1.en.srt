00:00:00,921 --> 00:00:04,198
Mayday, Mayday.
Mouchie's having a heart attack.

2
00:00:04,234 --> 00:00:06,745
They're suspending you
for 60 days without pay.

3
00:00:06,781 --> 00:00:08,913
- I tried.
- You are so out of touch.

4
00:00:08,949 --> 00:00:10,563
<i>I'm not what
I used to be.</i>

5
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:11,983
I'm retiring.

6
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:13,519
This is my last shift.

7
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:15,253
We gotta get
out of here now.

8
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:19,123
Mouch, I'm so sorry, Mouch.

9
00:00:19,159 --> 00:00:22,760
Let's go, let's go,
let's go.

10
00:00:22,796 --> 00:00:24,336
<i>This situation with
my dad isn't ideal.</i>

11
00:00:24,372 --> 00:00:25,655
<i>I want a date
when he's gone.</i>

12
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:26,814
That is not how
marriage works.

13
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:27,824
We talk things out.

14
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,581
I understand you wanting
to help out your dad, but...

15
00:00:29,617 --> 00:00:30,443
Oh, you do?

16
00:00:30,479 --> 00:00:32,816
Because you're really,
really not showing it.

17
00:00:38,313 --> 00:00:39,848
<i>Entrance is blocked.</i>

18
00:00:39,884 --> 00:00:42,613
<i>Evacuate that building
any way you can.</i>

19
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:43,760
<i>Is Gabby there?</i>

20
00:00:43,796 --> 00:00:45,721
Yeah, yeah, baby.
I'm here, I'm here.

21
00:00:45,757 --> 00:00:47,256
<i>Gabby.</i>

22
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:50,322
<i>You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.</i>

23
00:00:50,358 --> 00:00:53,158
I love you.

24
00:00:53,194 --> 00:00:54,048
<i>Bye, Gabby.</i>

25
00:00:54,084 --> 00:00:56,695
No.
No.

26
00:01:07,675 --> 00:01:09,140
Emergency.

27
00:01:09,176 --> 00:01:10,776

<i>Truck 81, Engine 51,</i>

29
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:14,913
<i>if you can hear me,</i>

30
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:17,648
<i>take cover anywhere
that you can.</i>

31
00:01:17,684 --> 00:01:19,684
We're about to open up
the water cannons.

32
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,288
Chief, you'll
boil them alive.

33
00:01:23,324 --> 00:01:25,624
What choice do I have?

34
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:30,062
It may not be much,
but it's all we got.

35
00:01:32,232 --> 00:01:34,699
Cover yourselves.

36
00:01:34,735 --> 00:01:37,372
Kannell, this way.
Let's move.

37
00:01:37,408 --> 00:01:40,705
Squad's headed to
the east stairwell, Chief.

38
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:43,208
Water cannons
go up in ten...

39
00:01:45,246 --> 00:01:48,045
<i>nine...</i>

40
00:01:48,081 --> 00:01:50,982
- Hit it! Hit it!
- <i>Eight...</i>

41
00:01:51,018 --> 00:01:53,919
Seven...

42
00:01:53,955 --> 00:01:55,920
six...

43
00:01:55,956 --> 00:01:57,613
- Cover yourself, baby.
- Five...

44
00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:00,157
Come on, baby.

45
00:02:00,193 --> 00:02:03,228
<i>Four...</i>

46
00:02:03,264 --> 00:02:06,264

48
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:11,669
<i>one.</i>

49
00:02:15,876 --> 00:02:18,109
That's it.
Open up the water cannons.

50
00:03:24,201 --> 00:03:26,000
Mouch!

51
00:03:26,146 --> 00:03:27,882
Herrmann!

52
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,719
Mouch!

53
00:03:31,765 --> 00:03:33,801
Herrmann!

54
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:40,749
Herrmann.
Herrmann.

55
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:42,834
Herrmann.

56
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,892
Casey.

57
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:04,026
Severide, Kannell, call out!

58
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:07,561
Kannell and I are safe, Chief.
We're headed out.

59
00:04:07,663 --> 00:04:11,288
Do you have
eyes on Casey?

60
00:04:11,324 --> 00:04:12,524
Negative, Chief.

61
00:04:32,028 --> 00:04:34,129
Casey.

62
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:41,119
Casey.
Casey!

As I think of the life
of Matthew Casey,

65
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:07,412
certain words come
to the top of my mind.

66
00:05:07,448 --> 00:05:11,282
Honesty, integrity,

67
00:05:11,318 --> 00:05:14,274
bravery, sure.

68
00:05:14,384 --> 00:05:17,950
But there are other words
right there, too.

69
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:20,257
Like...

70
00:05:20,427 --> 00:05:23,427
brother.

71
00:05:23,463 --> 00:05:25,399
Son.

72
00:05:28,934 --> 00:05:31,634
Husband.

73
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:36,036
And I am lucky enough
to call him a friend.

74
00:05:36,244 --> 00:05:38,280
Matthew Casey...

75
00:05:47,827 --> 00:05:51,995
I proudly bestow this
Medal of Valor upon you,

76
00:05:52,126 --> 00:05:54,230
not only because of
the bravery that you showed

77
00:05:54,297 --> 00:05:56,476
at the South Bishop fire,

78
00:05:56,547 --> 00:05:59,409
but also because of the valor
that you show

79
00:05:59,445 --> 00:06:04,013
on the streets of Chicago
every single day.

80
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:06,878
Order arms.

81
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:31,496
Good looking chest, boy.

82
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,244
- Listen, I...
- There's something I wanted...

83
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:54,286
Dad, what's going on?

84
00:06:54,376 --> 00:06:56,174
Uh, well, uh...

85
00:06:56,289 --> 00:06:58,785
What's going on is that
I am officially

86
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:01,159
getting out of your hair.

87
00:07:01,195 --> 00:07:02,579
What are you
talking about?

88
00:07:02,618 --> 00:07:05,709
I cannot thank you two
enough for, uh,

89
00:07:05,771 --> 00:07:09,034
helping me right this ship
for the last couple of months.

90
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,266
I've got three great
job leads, I'm...

91
00:07:11,328 --> 00:07:14,064
Dad, we are happy
to have you stay with us.

92
00:07:16,242 --> 00:07:18,542
Yeah, yeah.
More than happy.

93
00:07:18,578 --> 00:07:20,582
I know,
and I appreciate it.

94
00:07:20,644 --> 00:07:23,804
But I've been imposing on you
for way too long.

95
00:07:23,851 --> 00:07:25,895
So there's nothing
more to be said.

96
00:07:25,973 --> 00:07:28,686
I love you so much, <i>mija.</i>

97
00:07:28,722 --> 00:07:31,092
I love you, too.

98
00:07:33,426 --> 00:07:36,572
Matt, congratulations
on the medal,

99
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:39,263
and thank you sincerely.

100
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:41,024
Anytime.

101
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:44,184
Well, I'm on the move
to the next chapter

102
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:47,700
on this adventure known
as the life of Ramón Dawsona.

103
00:07:47,736 --> 00:07:48,837
You know, if it
doesn't work out...

104
00:07:48,873 --> 00:07:50,111
No, nope, nope, uh-uh.

105
00:07:50,147 --> 00:07:53,875
From now on,
it's nothing but up.

106
00:07:53,945 --> 00:07:57,047
<i>Te amo mucho.</i>

107
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,254
That was abrupt.

108
00:08:01,688 --> 00:08:04,092
Yep.

109
00:08:08,328 --> 00:08:10,427
You know, this is
the first time in months

110
00:08:10,463 --> 00:08:13,133
we've had the whole place
to ourselves.

111
00:08:15,602 --> 00:08:17,237
Yep.

112
00:08:26,926 --> 00:08:29,025
You'd better take
that uniform off.

113
00:08:29,061 --> 00:08:30,797
Yep.

114
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:24,305
Ah, Trudy.

115
00:09:25,705 --> 00:09:27,072
- Mouchie!
- Hey.

116
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,544
He's back.

117
00:09:31,412 --> 00:09:34,478
You look incredible.
Doesn't he look incredible?

118
00:09:34,514 --> 00:09:35,814
Incredible.

119
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,566
It's good
to have you back, Mouch.

120
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,220
Thanks.

121
00:09:38,256 --> 00:09:39,527
It's almost like
you didn't go visit him

122
00:09:39,574 --> 00:09:41,067
every single day
he was laid up.

123
00:09:41,103 --> 00:09:43,755
I was on suspension
for 60 days.

124
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,156
I had to keep
busy somehow, huh?

125
00:09:46,192 --> 00:09:48,056
Hey, come here.
Come on.

126
00:09:48,111 --> 00:09:50,594
I got something for you.

127
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,863
Hey, Mouch.

128
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:54,466
- Keep them closed, okay?
- Yep, yep.

129
00:09:54,502 --> 00:09:56,568
- Okay, just turn here.
- Uh-huh.

130
00:09:56,604 --> 00:09:58,736
All right.

131
00:09:58,772 --> 00:10:01,091
Ta-da!

132
00:10:01,138 --> 00:10:02,522
It's perfect, right?

133
00:10:02,558 --> 00:10:03,735
It marks your spot,

134
00:10:03,797 --> 00:10:06,544
and it provides
much-needed lumbar support.

135
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,040
That's really sweet
of you, Joe,

136
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:12,382
but, uh, prolonged
sitting is linked

137
00:10:12,418 --> 00:10:15,453
to cardiovascular disease,
it turns out.

138
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:18,555
Of course.
So stupid.

139
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:22,352
Ah! I know a fantastic
recipe for a power smoothie.

140
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:24,585
Ooh.

141
00:10:24,731 --> 00:10:27,198
Hey.

142
00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:29,637
Hey, so, uh, is
he still trying to make up

143
00:10:29,673 --> 00:10:31,468
for how he jumped you
over that suspension?

144
00:10:31,504 --> 00:10:33,237
Nah, it's water
under the bridge.

145
00:10:33,273 --> 00:10:36,540
Not for him.

146
00:10:36,576 --> 00:10:38,476
So hey, oh, boom-boom!

147
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,211
How you feeling,
Dead Mouch?

148
00:10:40,247 --> 00:10:42,473
- I'm not dead, Herrmann.
- You flatlined!

149
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:45,082
I have seen bodies in
the morgue move more than you.

150
00:10:45,136 --> 00:10:46,717
Rearview mirror.

151
00:10:46,753 --> 00:10:49,386
I've got a whole new fitness
and nutrition regimen.

152
00:10:49,422 --> 00:10:52,054
I'm eating chia seeds
and all kinds of good stuff.

153
00:10:52,093 --> 00:10:54,626
You look great, Mouch.
You really do.

154
00:10:54,662 --> 00:10:56,464
But the nickname Dead Mouch
is here to stay.

155
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,030
Yeah.

156
00:10:57,066 --> 00:11:01,698
And I'm warning everyone
that if you persist

157
00:11:01,734 --> 00:11:03,731
- in calling me that...
- Otis, Herrmann.

158
00:11:03,786 --> 00:11:05,469
Dead Mouch.

159
00:11:05,505 --> 00:11:07,117
Okay, come on, you guys.

160
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:09,184
Lay off Mouch, all right?
He's been through a lot.

161
00:11:09,223 --> 00:11:11,675
Here you go, buddy.

162
00:11:11,711 --> 00:11:12,590
- Mmm.
- Eh?

163
00:11:12,645 --> 00:11:14,299
- Mmm!
- Could I just...

164
00:11:14,345 --> 00:11:17,249
Chia later.

165
00:11:24,457 --> 00:11:25,435
Can I help you, bud?

166
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,626
I'm looking for someone.

167
00:11:29,662 --> 00:11:31,563
Hey, bitch.

168
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:33,387
What, you talk smack on me,
you don't think there's

169
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:36,266
gonna be consequences?

170
00:11:42,008 --> 00:11:43,835
- This is where I work.
- Yeah.

171
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,011
And my Angie's List page
is where I conduct my business.

172
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,320
You neg-rep me online,
I can't fill the building.

173
00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:49,480
Be a better landlord,

174
00:11:49,516 --> 00:11:50,763
and I'd be happy
to delete it.

175
00:11:50,802 --> 00:11:52,315
Every day,
it's something with you.

176
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,147
Leaky faucet, new paint.

177
00:11:54,225 --> 00:11:56,997
I've had more calls from you
than any tenant in 15 years.

178
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:59,501
Because you bully them the way
you're trying to bully me.

179
00:11:59,571 --> 00:12:01,759
The only difference is I'm not
gonna let you call me names

180
00:12:01,795 --> 00:12:02,993
and kick sand in my face.

181
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:04,141
I want your rent.

182
00:12:04,204 --> 00:12:05,859
Fix the fridge,
and you'll get it.

183
00:12:05,895 --> 00:12:07,639
Your check,
my mail box, Friday,

184
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,172
or so help me God...

185
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:10,672
Renters' rights.
Look them up.

186
00:12:10,734 --> 00:12:12,540
So help me God.

187
00:12:16,877 --> 00:12:20,578
Hey, everything all right?

188
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,746
Yeah.

189
00:12:22,782 --> 00:12:25,720
Tucker messed
with the wrong tenant.

190
00:12:30,872 --> 00:12:33,211
Well, Lieutenant Casey,

191
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:34,827
word churning
around headquarters

192
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,887
is that you have
eyes on you now.

193
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,697
- Uh-oh.
- In a good way.

194
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:40,315
Title of captain
in your future.

195
00:12:40,351 --> 00:12:42,283
Ooh, Lord help us all.

196
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:44,386
Hey, I'm just glad
not to be an alderman.

197
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:46,712
Told Gabby it's high time
I focus on the job

198
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,414
I'm actually good at.

199
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,015
Hear, hear to that.

200
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:54,192
- So, regarding Jason Kannell.
- What's this?

201
00:12:54,228 --> 00:12:56,017
Oh, we got denied
an extra man on squad,

202
00:12:56,053 --> 00:12:56,807
so Chief here...

203
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:00,092
I found him a permanent
spot on first shift.

204
00:13:00,128 --> 00:13:01,293
Oh, that's great.

205
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:04,478
I'll call him to celebrate.

206
00:13:04,544 --> 00:13:06,044
Donna.

207
00:13:06,088 --> 00:13:07,904
To what do we
owe the pleasure?

208
00:13:07,943 --> 00:13:09,751
You know what?
To hell with what I owe.

209
00:13:09,814 --> 00:13:11,876
I am just pleased
to see you.

210
00:13:11,912 --> 00:13:14,745
Aww, that's why
I married you.

211
00:13:14,823 --> 00:13:16,109
Boys, no matter how
many women say

212
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,179
they don't like
to be sweet-talked,

213
00:13:17,242 --> 00:13:19,116
let me tell you, they do.

214
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:20,295
I'll keep that in mind.

215
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:22,047
Yeah,
you write that down.

216
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,476
Get out.

217
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,610
So?

218
00:13:25,646 --> 00:13:27,902
Um, so I was coming
to remind you that

219
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,148
tomorrow night is my first

220
00:13:29,211 --> 00:13:30,779
parent-teacher night
of the year,

221
00:13:30,815 --> 00:13:32,451
and you're gonna need
this carpool sign

222
00:13:32,514 --> 00:13:34,258
to pick up Terrence
from day care.

223
00:13:34,328 --> 00:13:36,453
Right.
Consider it taken care of.

224
00:13:36,489 --> 00:13:38,523
And, uh,
just remind me

225
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:40,617
why I wanted to move
from 4th grade to high school.

226
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,961
Well, if words
serve me correctly,

227
00:13:42,997 --> 00:13:45,425
you said you need
more of a challenge.

228
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:47,298
- Did I say that?
- You did.

229
00:13:47,334 --> 00:13:49,569
Okay.
Oh, I gotta go.

230
00:13:49,605 --> 00:13:50,626
There's an assembly
this morning,

231
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,490
so all hands on deck.

232
00:13:51,526 --> 00:13:54,239
- Okay, go get them.
- Okay.

233
00:13:54,275 --> 00:13:56,478
Thanks for stopping by.

234
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,636
So I have great news.

235
00:14:00,722 --> 00:14:02,580
My friend, Hope Jacquinot,
is in town.

236
00:14:02,616 --> 00:14:04,949
She just texted me,
and she's on her way over here.

237
00:14:04,985 --> 00:14:06,181
Go on.

238
00:14:06,217 --> 00:14:08,611
Well, we used to call her
"Shock-and-Awe" in high school.

239
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:10,679
I mean, because of her name,
but also because she was always

240
00:14:10,715 --> 00:14:12,622
- just doing crazy stuff.
- Keep going.

241
00:14:12,693 --> 00:14:13,823
You guys
are gonna love her.

242
00:14:13,863 --> 00:14:17,311
She was the Hog Queen of
Fowlerton four years running.

243
00:14:17,347 --> 00:14:18,940
Okay, you can stop now.

244
00:14:18,987 --> 00:14:20,586
No, that's a big deal.

245
00:14:20,717 --> 00:14:23,683
- I wanna party with this girl.
- It's an open invitation.

246
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,030
I'm gonna take her
to Molly's tomorrow night.

247
00:14:25,101 --> 00:14:26,675
Yeah, I'm gonna be needing
tomorrow night off, Herrmann.

248
00:14:26,722 --> 00:14:28,723
Yeah, fat chance.

249
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:31,191
- Fowlerton in the house.
- Oh, my God!

250
00:14:31,227 --> 00:14:33,480
Were your ears burning?
I was just talking about you.

251
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,730
- All good, I take it.
- Oh, yeah. You look amazing.

252
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,061
She was actually
raving about you.

253
00:14:38,097 --> 00:14:40,159
- Hi, Brian Zvonecek.
- Oh.

254
00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:43,070
- Joe Cruz. Nice to meet you.
- Oh.

255
00:14:43,106 --> 00:14:46,277
Look at you, get to work
with a bunch of firemen.

256
00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:49,564
Firefighters.
That's what we say.

257
00:14:49,647 --> 00:14:51,047
How long are
you in town?

258
00:14:51,109 --> 00:14:53,515
Just a couple of weeks.
I got an Airbnb.

259
00:14:53,551 --> 00:14:55,288
- I'm free to hang.
- Amazing.

260
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:57,198
That is amazing,
'cause I actually own a bar.

261
00:14:57,253 --> 00:14:57,858
Co-own.

262
00:14:57,928 --> 00:15:00,121
I am a managing
part of the bar, so...

263
00:15:00,157 --> 00:15:02,774
Okay, so I'm gonna go
check on lunch.

264
00:15:02,852 --> 00:15:05,167
Hope, it was
lovely to meet you.

265
00:15:05,214 --> 00:15:07,790
Don't worry about these two.
They're harmless.

266
00:15:07,826 --> 00:15:10,330
Not too harmless,
I hope, hmm?

267
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:16,447
You, however...

268
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,866
- Kelly, quick question.
- Yeah?

269
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:20,675
When you're working
on your core,

270
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,942
do you concentrate on
fast-twitch isometric training,

271
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,146
or do you go with
more low-intensity,

272
00:15:26,182 --> 00:15:28,516
high-impact repetition?

273
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,385
- What?
- It's just, I've been doing

274
00:15:30,421 --> 00:15:31,819
some concentric CrossFit,
you know,

275
00:15:31,855 --> 00:15:34,189
since I have more of
a mesomorph physique.

276
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,016
I just lift weights, man.

277
00:15:36,052 --> 00:15:38,135
Of course.
I mean, yeah, me too.

278
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:40,661
Also I throw in
some Power Fit, X-Fit,

279
00:15:40,697 --> 00:15:42,650
you know, core balance
type thing.

280
00:15:42,686 --> 00:15:44,930
Well, you look
absolutely great, brother.

281
00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:45,514
Thank you.

282
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:49,304
Also, I have two tickets
to this week's Bears game.

283
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,088
And they're yours.
50 yard line, 20 rows up.

284
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:56,710
Whoa.
Thank you, Joe.

285
00:15:59,616 --> 00:16:01,801
I will admit,
I like the sound

286
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,466
of Captain Casey.

287
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:05,560
Which would make me
Mrs. Captain Casey.

288
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:06,962
I gotta shut down
the speculation

289
00:16:07,025 --> 00:16:08,299
before it gets out of hand.

290
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:09,519
Which is just a temporary
step on the ladder

291
00:16:09,555 --> 00:16:10,916
to Chief Casey.

292
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,387
You're worse than
the rest of them.

293
00:16:12,434 --> 00:16:15,035
You look good in white,
is all I'm saying.

294
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,898
Making Chief's
all about the politics.

295
00:16:17,934 --> 00:16:20,468
I've had enough of that
to last me a lifetime.

296
00:16:20,504 --> 00:16:22,514
From now on,
just give me an axe

297
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,231
and a halligan,
point me toward a fire.

298
00:16:37,821 --> 00:16:41,289
I'm not gonna be too happy
when you outrank me.

299
00:16:41,325 --> 00:16:42,123
Huh.

300
00:16:42,197 --> 00:16:43,965
Just putting you
on notice.

301
00:16:44,023 --> 00:16:45,623
Fair warning, then.

302
00:16:45,863 --> 00:16:48,563
Well, Dawson says that
you gave her old man the boot.

303
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:49,930
She said what?

304
00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:51,358
Well, she actually
said he just left,

305
00:16:51,394 --> 00:16:53,734
- but I figured you...
- My hands are clean.

306
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,536
He's gone of
his own accord.

307
00:16:55,572 --> 00:16:58,205
Nice.
How'd that feel?

308
00:16:58,241 --> 00:16:59,965
You have no idea.

309
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,207
Help!

310
00:17:02,336 --> 00:17:04,102
Help!

311
00:17:04,138 --> 00:17:06,604
Help, my girl!
My little girl!

312
00:17:08,801 --> 00:17:10,433
Help me!

313
00:17:10,587 --> 00:17:12,287
- Gabby.
- Brett.

314
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,355
Come on.

315
00:17:14,391 --> 00:17:16,357
Here.
Set her down here.

316
00:17:27,924 --> 00:17:28,982
Her eyes.

317
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:30,982
She was eating,
and then her eyes...

318
00:17:31,018 --> 00:17:32,498
All right. Come on.
Give them some room.

319
00:17:32,547 --> 00:17:33,631
She's choking.

320
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:34,669
She was probably
trying to cough,

321
00:17:34,739 --> 00:17:36,915
and she busted some
blood vessels in her eyes.

322
00:17:39,165 --> 00:17:42,766
- Nothing.
- I'll get the forceps.

323
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:44,118
Will she be blind?

324
00:17:44,154 --> 00:17:46,654
Let's try to
get her breathing first.

325
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,912
What was she eating?

326
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,125
- Hot dogs.
- Hey, hey, hey.

327
00:18:06,576 --> 00:18:08,246
Damn it.
One more push.

328
00:18:12,516 --> 00:18:13,515
Got it.

329
00:18:16,423 --> 00:18:19,587
- Let's get her to Med.
- Yeah.

330
00:18:19,623 --> 00:18:23,124
- Honey, how do you feel?
- It hurts.

331
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,791
I see you guys race out
onto the street every day.

332
00:18:26,846 --> 00:18:30,498
I will never complain
about the sirens again.

333
00:18:30,534 --> 00:18:31,788
Hey, baby.

334
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,975
Happy we could help.

335
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,966
- Thanks, guys.
- Yeah.

336
00:18:41,068 --> 00:18:43,271
- Okay, come with us.
- Yes, ma'am.

337
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,997
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

338
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:57,334
Oh, Hope.
I'm so glad you made it.

339
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,158
I mean, I've never been
to a firefighter bar before.

340
00:19:00,204 --> 00:19:04,133
Oh, yeah, we've got cops,
doctors, lawyers...

341
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:06,442
Well, not so many
lawyers, anyway.

342
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,701
Anyway, what can I
get you to drink?

343
00:19:07,737 --> 00:19:10,168
Um, can you make
a Moscow Mule?

344
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:11,953
You got it.

345
00:19:15,103 --> 00:19:17,293
Oh, uh, yeah,
I should warn you.

346
00:19:17,348 --> 00:19:19,055
Kelly Severide's
probably not the best guy

347
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,844
for you to set
your sights on.

348
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,325
What's that?

349
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:25,130
Uh, Hope was
staring at Kelly.

350
00:19:25,201 --> 00:19:28,388
I don't know about staring.
I mean, look at him, though.

351
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:31,600
Well, he recently lost
his girlfriend to cancer.

352
00:19:31,636 --> 00:19:34,043
- Oh.
- Yeah. It was awful.

353
00:19:34,113 --> 00:19:36,300
And before you think you can be
the shoulder that he cries on,

354
00:19:36,363 --> 00:19:38,458
just know that he's
already been comforted

355
00:19:38,513 --> 00:19:40,609
by half the women in Chicago,
so...

356
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,612
Oh, hey.

357
00:19:49,674 --> 00:19:51,488
Can you switch with me tomorrow
night and close the shop?

358
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,222
- I got a thing.
- What thing?

359
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:56,625
Uh, it's, uh...

360
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:59,715
escape room design class.

361
00:19:59,777 --> 00:20:00,664
Oh.

362
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,642
Well, can't.
Looking at apartments.

363
00:20:03,712 --> 00:20:05,330
Well, then why'd you make me
say what I was doing then?

364
00:20:05,385 --> 00:20:08,504
I just wanted to see what you
had planned on a Saturday night.

365
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,272
Looking for apartments?

366
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:12,107
I thought you had
a three-year lease.

367
00:20:12,143 --> 00:20:13,088
Oh, yeah.

368
00:20:13,158 --> 00:20:16,620
Apparently I violated
the tenant-renter agreement.

369
00:20:16,698 --> 00:20:18,414
- No.
- Yeah.

370
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,615
He evicted me.

371
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:23,019
Oh. I'm so sorry.

372
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,185
Well, there's a fold-up cot
in the corner.

373
00:20:25,247 --> 00:20:26,665
Herrmann likes to use it
when he has early deliveries

374
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:28,023
and he doesn't want to
drive across town.

375
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:29,550
I wondered what that
was doing here.

376
00:20:29,586 --> 00:20:31,488
Yeah, just, you know,
use it as long as you need,

377
00:20:31,527 --> 00:20:33,696
and shower at the firehouse.

378
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,136
And don't tell anybody
about the design class.

379
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:56,086
Hi. I'm Hope.
Sylvie's friend

380
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:59,722
Ah. Kelly.

381
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,558
You, um, left your
phone at the bar.

382
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,795
Ah, no, I was just
keeping my spot.

383
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:09,448
Well, I might've
put my number in it.

384
00:21:09,484 --> 00:21:11,751
You did, did you?

385
00:21:11,787 --> 00:21:13,922
Yeah.

386
00:21:13,977 --> 00:21:17,037
I just wanted you to know
that you can text me anytime.

387
00:21:17,095 --> 00:21:19,131
Okay.

388
00:21:29,404 --> 00:21:30,770
Boo.

389
00:21:30,806 --> 00:21:32,101
- Dad.
- Hey.

390
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,141
- Hey.
- Hey.

391
00:21:34,195 --> 00:21:35,588
It's good to see you.

392
00:21:35,663 --> 00:21:37,462
I thought I'd pop in.
Say hello.

393
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,845
I'm sorry I haven't called.

394
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,748
I've been on
the job hunt, just...

395
00:21:40,811 --> 00:21:43,249
- Yeah, how's that going?
- Okay.

396
00:21:43,285 --> 00:21:46,505
I got a second interview
at one place, so we'll see.

397
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,355
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

398
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,521
- Well, uh, keep us posted, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

399
00:21:52,557 --> 00:21:55,498
- Good to see you, Pops.
- Good to see you.

400
00:22:05,441 --> 00:22:09,608
Um, I talked to
Chaplain Orlovsky.

401
00:22:09,644 --> 00:22:13,282
And, uh, he said that, uh,
you haven't been by to see him.

402
00:22:15,718 --> 00:22:17,353
Been busy.

403
00:22:21,824 --> 00:22:25,020
Kitten, you told me

404
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,800
that when Matt
said good-bye in that fire

405
00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:31,100
that it almost broke
everything inside of you.

406
00:22:34,737 --> 00:22:37,899
Look, uh, I'm not
a counselor, baby girl,

407
00:22:37,969 --> 00:22:43,426
but maybe that moment
was a little crack.

408
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,890
Maybe it widened
some other cracks

409
00:22:45,952 --> 00:22:48,531
that were already there.

410
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,465
I don't know.

411
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:51,600
But this is true,

412
00:22:51,655 --> 00:22:54,270
and you need to
listen to me, <i>hija.</i>

413
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:57,132
If you don't
repair these cracks,

414
00:22:57,187 --> 00:23:01,311
then the whole foundation
comes crumbling down.

415
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:05,885
So if it's not the chaplain,
just talk to someone.

416
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:12,254
I was upset,
and I'm good now.

417
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,791
Okay?
Just needed some time.

418
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:17,927
Which I got.

419
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,995
- Okay.
- Okay.

420
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:22,831
Glad to hear that.

421
00:23:22,867 --> 00:23:24,900
Okay.

422
00:23:35,896 --> 00:23:38,146
So I don't know
what anybody did.

423
00:23:40,255 --> 00:23:41,883
What's she
showering here for?

424
00:23:41,938 --> 00:23:43,194
She got the boot
from her apartment.

425
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,162
She's a bad tenant.

426
00:23:45,198 --> 00:23:46,834
- Aw.
- Yeah.

427
00:23:46,924 --> 00:23:47,816
I'd offer her a spot with us,

428
00:23:47,852 --> 00:23:48,957
but we're stuffed
to the rafters.

429
00:23:48,993 --> 00:23:51,351
She said she's out
looking for a new place.

430
00:23:51,387 --> 00:23:54,592
I had that mother-in-law suite
that we fixed up for Dawson.

431
00:23:54,639 --> 00:23:56,587
But then Henry
decided to move in

432
00:23:56,657 --> 00:23:59,806
because he says that
he's mostly an adult now.

433
00:23:59,884 --> 00:24:01,386
Oh, mostly.

434
00:24:18,548 --> 00:24:20,356
Herrmann,
will you hold my feet

435
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,590
while I get in
some crunches?

436
00:24:22,696 --> 00:24:25,345
Oh.
Okay.

437
00:24:26,914 --> 00:24:29,271
There you go, buddy.
Nice.

438
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:32,785
Almost there.

439
00:24:32,821 --> 00:24:35,287
There you go.
Stay strong.

440
00:24:35,323 --> 00:24:38,323
And ten.
Thanks, Joe.

441
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:40,627
- Pleasure's all mine.
- Whoo.

442
00:24:40,663 --> 00:24:42,464
Whoo.

443
00:24:44,732 --> 00:24:48,467
What?

444
00:24:48,503 --> 00:24:50,369
How long are you
gonna keep this going?

445
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:53,452
I am committed
to my fitness regime.

446
00:24:53,488 --> 00:24:55,513
No, I'm not
talking about fitness.

447
00:24:55,576 --> 00:24:57,276
I'm talking
about Joe Cruz

448
00:24:57,312 --> 00:24:59,557
turning into your
personal valet.

449
00:24:59,627 --> 00:25:02,615
You're letting him put
lipstick on and kiss your ass

450
00:25:02,651 --> 00:25:03,911
like it's your birthday.

451
00:25:03,965 --> 00:25:06,657
Uh, I think you're being
a little exaggerated

452
00:25:06,727 --> 00:25:07,719
in your description.

453
00:25:07,755 --> 00:25:09,321
Enough's enough.

454
00:25:09,357 --> 00:25:11,681
Tell the guy that
you forgive him,

455
00:25:11,751 --> 00:25:14,093
and let him get on
with his life.

456
00:25:14,129 --> 00:25:17,108
Here you go, Mouchie.
Nice hot towel.

457
00:25:17,186 --> 00:25:19,532
- Ooh. Oh.
- Yeah.

458
00:25:19,568 --> 00:25:23,405
- Helps get out the toxins.
- Why thank you, Joe.

459
00:25:25,307 --> 00:25:26,673
- Okay.
- So good.

460
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:27,806
Yeah.

461
00:25:27,842 --> 00:25:31,110
Oh. Ooh.
Ah.

462
00:25:31,146 --> 00:25:33,713
- Christopher.
- Hey, Chaplain Orlovsky.

463
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:34,926
Great to see you, Padre.

464
00:25:34,962 --> 00:25:37,382
Yeah, always good
to stop by 51.

465
00:25:37,418 --> 00:25:40,253
So, you just visiting,
or does the big man upstairs

466
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:41,604
got some
urgent business?

467
00:25:41,682 --> 00:25:43,423
Is Gabby Dawson around?

468
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,693
Oh, I saw her...
she's probably...

469
00:25:46,729 --> 00:25:48,660
I don't know.

470
00:25:48,696 --> 00:25:52,327
Anyway, I'll, uh, be around
for a bit if anyone wants to,

471
00:25:52,389 --> 00:25:54,434
you know, download on me.

472
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,236
Weird how you tend
to visit around lunch.

473
00:25:57,272 --> 00:25:58,561
Funny.

474
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:00,273
Divine guidance.

475
00:26:19,353 --> 00:26:22,998
<i>Squad 3, Truck 81,
Ambulance 61, Engine 51.</i>

476
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:25,792
<i>School fire,
4538 West Quincy.</i>

477
00:26:25,871 --> 00:26:27,266
That's Donna's school.

478
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,862
Herrmann,
you and Kidd together.

479
00:26:56,898 --> 00:26:58,531
Mouch, how you feeling?

480
00:26:58,567 --> 00:27:00,465
Like riding a bike,
Lieutenant.

481
00:27:00,501 --> 00:27:01,667
You're with Otis.

482
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,181
What about you,
Lieutenant?

483
00:27:03,234 --> 00:27:04,689
I'm sure Chief is
going in on this one,

484
00:27:04,736 --> 00:27:06,673
so I'll stay close to him.

485
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:07,960
I'll cover the chief.

486
00:27:08,015 --> 00:27:10,189
That means I want the three
of you on a controlled sweep

487
00:27:10,244 --> 00:27:11,859
of wherever
the fire's the hottest.

488
00:27:11,953 --> 00:27:13,367
These kids are
gonna be panicked,

489
00:27:13,437 --> 00:27:14,738
so point them
toward the exits.

490
00:27:14,808 --> 00:27:16,882
Make sure you don't stop
except for anyone down.

491
00:27:16,918 --> 00:27:18,484
You got it, Lieutenant.

492
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,214
Hit the ground
running, boys.

493
00:27:20,277 --> 00:27:21,754
Here we go.

494
00:27:29,798 --> 00:27:31,664
Come on,
let's make our lines.

495
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,699
Come on.
We drilled for this.

496
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:38,705
Don't panic.
Come on, everybody out.

497
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:40,607
- Get two hose lines in there.
- <i>Copy that.</i>

498
00:27:40,643 --> 00:27:42,908
Truck, Squad,
search and evacuate.

499
00:27:42,944 --> 00:27:43,909
Let's go.

500
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:51,239
You seen Donna Boden?

501
00:27:51,286 --> 00:27:53,523
I saw her running
toward the fire.

502
00:27:53,585 --> 00:27:55,455
It started in
the chemistry lab.

503
00:27:55,491 --> 00:27:57,434
Make a path.
Keep moving.

504
00:27:57,496 --> 00:27:59,626
This way.

505
00:27:59,662 --> 00:28:01,261
Be careful.

506
00:28:01,297 --> 00:28:03,669
If you have trouble breathing,
I want you to sit down.

507
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:06,032
More help is
on the way, guys.

508
00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:20,547
Get clear.

509
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:22,784
Clear out.

510
00:28:22,885 --> 00:28:24,721
Come on.

511
00:28:27,021 --> 00:28:29,554
- Handle that!
- Got it, Chief.

512
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,860
Let's go.
Let's go.

513
00:28:36,865 --> 00:28:38,965
Hey, I got it, Chief.

514
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:41,633
I got her.

515
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:43,503
I got her.

516
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:49,059
Hey. Move, move!

517
00:28:49,129 --> 00:28:52,378
Yeah, yeah.

518
00:28:52,414 --> 00:28:55,045
Hey!
Get out now!

519
00:28:55,091 --> 00:28:56,948
Go, kid.

520
00:28:59,887 --> 00:29:01,279
This way.

521
00:29:01,341 --> 00:29:02,741
- Come on, let's go.
- This way. Come on.

522
00:29:02,803 --> 00:29:05,658
Hug the wall to
the right to get out.

523
00:29:05,694 --> 00:29:07,659
Donna!

524
00:29:07,695 --> 00:29:10,862
- Fire department.
- Donna!

525
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,335
Donna...

526
00:29:21,964 --> 00:29:25,035
Wallace!

527
00:29:25,105 --> 00:29:28,038
Chief, you all right?

528
00:29:28,093 --> 00:29:30,299
Yeah. I'm fine.

529
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:33,002
Donna.

530
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:34,937
Donna!

531
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:37,005
Hey.

532
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:38,773
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

533
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:40,876
Okay.
Come on.

534
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,078
We'll get you
out of here.

535
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,879
Come on.

536
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:46,881
- Come on.
- Come on.

537
00:29:46,917 --> 00:29:48,317
Wait!

538
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:50,619
Ms. Wagner,
the chemistry teacher.

539
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:51,791
She's still inside
the classroom.

540
00:29:51,853 --> 00:29:52,540
I had to get
the kids out.

541
00:29:52,587 --> 00:29:54,924
- Casey, go.
- Got it.

542
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,582
Come on,
I got you.

543
00:29:56,652 --> 00:29:57,927
Cover yourself.

544
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,995
Fire department.
Call out.

545
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:15,350
Casey, come on!
We gotta move!

546
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:17,178
Give me a hand.

547
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:24,754
Okay. Let's go.

548
00:30:28,854 --> 00:30:31,257
Dawson!
Brett!

549
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,700
Oh, man.

550
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,272
One, two, three, up.

551
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,643
We gotta intubate.

552
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:02,828
Okay.

553
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:09,801
Hey, Chief.
Fire's out.

554
00:31:13,003 --> 00:31:14,837
What's the count?

555
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,843
Everyone's
accounted for, Chief.

556
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:23,281
You're in.
Let's get her out of here.

557
00:31:27,071 --> 00:31:29,071
Hey.
Can I go with you?

558
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:32,888
Yeah, of course.

559
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:35,860
I'll finish up here.
Meet you at Med.

560
00:31:46,045 --> 00:31:49,612
- Too soon, Herrmann.
- Too soon.

561
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:52,041
I just got off
the phone with command.

562
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:57,213
And I have successfully signed
up Firehouse 51's second shift

563
00:31:57,249 --> 00:32:00,815
for the Firefighter Muster.

564
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:02,885
What the...

565
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,919
It's like an Olympics
for firefighters.

566
00:32:04,955 --> 00:32:06,455
There's the bucket
brigade challenge,

567
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:08,224
the two-man carry,
the ladder...

568
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,459
I know what a Muster is.
But you signed us up?

569
00:32:11,495 --> 00:32:14,996
That's right.
And I'm the coach.

570
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,714
Sounds horrible.

571
00:32:19,787 --> 00:32:22,090
Yeah, I don't know.

572
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,878
I need this.

573
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:39,921
No one but Herrmann
knows this,

574
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:44,829
but I came this close
to walking off this job.

575
00:32:46,463 --> 00:32:48,348
And I'm not...
I'm not talking

576
00:32:48,413 --> 00:32:50,212
about my heart stopping.

577
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:52,067
Before that.

578
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:56,938
I almost gave up the second
greatest thing in my life

579
00:32:56,974 --> 00:33:00,876
because I was feeling
a little run down.

580
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:05,180
And when I was lying
on the ground

581
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:07,582
in that burning factory,

582
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:10,351
the one thing I thought about

583
00:33:10,387 --> 00:33:12,857
was it wasn't enough.

584
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:18,260
Not enough
time with Trudy.

585
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:20,830
Not enough time at 51.

586
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:22,898
Not enough time
with you guys.

587
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:26,202
My brothers and sisters.

588
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:29,138
So...

589
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,840
yeah.

590
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:34,075
I signed us up,

591
00:33:34,111 --> 00:33:37,946
because, man,

592
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:40,081
I treasure these moments

593
00:33:40,117 --> 00:33:41,984
when we're together.

594
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,235
And I don't wanna be
looking down the dark end

595
00:33:44,282 --> 00:33:49,058
of that tunnel ever again,

596
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:51,260
thinking it wasn't enough.

597
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:11,113
Of course
we'll be there.

598
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:13,282
Come here.
Thanks, buddy.

599
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:16,218
This event is mandatory.

600
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:19,555
Yeah!
Yeah!

601
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:20,971
This is a great idea.

602
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:23,446
Thank you, buddy.

603
00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:50,019
So you all
just moved in together?

604
00:34:50,055 --> 00:34:52,186
Yeah.
Worked out perfectly.

605
00:34:52,222 --> 00:34:55,157
They needed a bigger place,
and I didn't like living

606
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:57,559
by myself,
so opportunity came knocking,

607
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,193
and I answered.

608
00:34:59,229 --> 00:35:00,262
So cool.

609
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:01,597
Yeah, they're great.

610
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:04,432
Like big brothers, really.

611
00:35:04,468 --> 00:35:05,816
If you lived with
two men in Fowlerton,

612
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:09,188
- you'd get run out on a rail.
- Oh, God, I know.

613
00:35:09,282 --> 00:35:11,041
Well, you are gonna love
this place we're going dancing.

614
00:35:11,103 --> 00:35:12,092
It's called Primary.

615
00:35:12,128 --> 00:35:14,977
It's a total scene,
but it's a lot of fun.

616
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:17,479
Actually, I met this
Canadian guy there once

617
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:18,894
who asked me to marry him,

618
00:35:18,972 --> 00:35:21,483
which I don't
really remember.

619
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,485
I think I had a little
too much to drink.

620
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:26,220
But Dawson talked me
out of matrimony.

621
00:35:26,256 --> 00:35:29,081
Thank God that didn't happen.

622
00:35:29,135 --> 00:35:30,492
Who are you texting?

623
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:33,361
- My mom.
- Oh.

624
00:35:47,215 --> 00:35:49,282
Aww.

625
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:52,448
You look like
a lost little puppy.

626
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,173
Look, if you're just
gonna make fun of me,

627
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:58,018
I'm gonna go back to...

628
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,210
I guess I don't really have
anywhere to go back to.

629
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:04,227
Come on in.

630
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:07,229
Thank you.

631
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:15,470
Thank you for offering
to let me crash here.

632
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,140
You're welcome.

633
00:36:17,202 --> 00:36:19,575
And there's no way I'm gonna
stop making fun of you.

634
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:22,011
Guess I brought
it on myself.

635
00:36:22,057 --> 00:36:23,544
Yeah.

636
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,832
"He messed with
the wrong tenant."

637
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:27,047
Look, how was
I supposed to know

638
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:30,019
I overstepped
the rental agreement?

639
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:31,153
Common sense?

640
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,759
Fine.
Deserved.

641
00:36:35,093 --> 00:36:37,998
And, I mean, this is
just for a few weeks.

642
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,794
I'm still looking
for my own place.

643
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,030
I get it.

644
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:42,430
Okay.

645
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:47,769
And, you know, uh, feel free
to do whatever you need to do.

646
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:52,541
With whomever
you need to do it with.

647
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,780
I will.

648
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:03,485
There's beer in the fridge.

649
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,790
Say no more.

650
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:15,811
They just opened.
Otis was telling me about it.

651
00:37:15,905 --> 00:37:17,960
Supposed to be
great crab legs.

652
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:21,436
We should go
before there's a line.

653
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:23,071
Yeah, sounds good.

654
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:25,441
Did you hear
from your dad?

655
00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:27,257
He got the job.

656
00:37:27,304 --> 00:37:29,611
- That's great.
- Yeah.

657
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,010
Second interview,
they hit it off.

658
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,481
He starts Monday.

659
00:37:32,517 --> 00:37:34,450
See?
Sometimes...

660
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:36,722
Don't ever say
good-bye to me again.

661
00:37:53,322 --> 00:37:56,556
I'd been meaning
to say something, but...

662
00:37:56,874 --> 00:38:01,146
just didn't know how,
or what.

663
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,610
I know that you'll never stop
running into burning buildings

664
00:38:05,681 --> 00:38:07,437
any more than I'll stop
putting my life on the line

665
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:09,626
every time
the ambo rolls out.

666
00:38:14,103 --> 00:38:19,272
But just tell me right now that
you'll always come back to me.

667
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:21,566
And I'll believe you.

668
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,247
I'll always
come back to you.

669
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:49,457
So thank you.

670
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,250
Just go tell
everyone you know.

671
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:53,520
Okay.

672
00:38:57,602 --> 00:39:02,303
Okay, uh...

673
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:04,122
Okay, they said that
Mrs. Wagner went in

674
00:39:04,169 --> 00:39:08,744
for a second surgery,
and it is still critical.

675
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,960
So we just need
to wait and see,

676
00:39:10,996 --> 00:39:13,515
and keep praying.

677
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:15,888
Okay?

678
00:39:19,856 --> 00:39:21,490
It's gonna be okay, honey.

679
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,492
All right?

680
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:31,733
Wallace, uh...

681
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:34,339
What is it?

682
00:39:36,492 --> 00:39:39,293
The fire
wasn't an accident.

683
00:39:42,411 --> 00:39:47,411

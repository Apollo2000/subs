1
00:00:01,239 --> 00:00:03,606
Gabby is gonna be one
hell of a firefighter.

2
00:00:03,641 --> 00:00:04,741
Can the two of you separate
your personal feelings

3
00:00:04,775 --> 00:00:06,676
from your professional responsibilities?

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,679
If you didn't think this was
a good idea would you tell me?

5
00:00:09,803 --> 00:00:11,237
I'm looking for Sylvie Brett.

6
00:00:11,271 --> 00:00:12,571
Harrison?

7
00:00:12,606 --> 00:00:15,140
I'm sorry I called off the
wedding and I want you back.

8
00:00:15,174 --> 00:00:16,842
Please come home.

9
00:00:16,876 --> 00:00:19,645
How you spend your time off
shift, that's your business.

10
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:21,280
The people in this house count on you.

11
00:00:21,314 --> 00:00:23,315
You know what I can count on? No one.

12
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,484
So, why don't you and
everyone else in this house

13
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:26,818
just leave me alone?

14
00:00:32,726 --> 00:00:35,294
Hi, I'm looking for my
niece and her mother.

15
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:38,329
The little girl's 12
years old... never mind.

16
00:00:38,364 --> 00:00:39,731
I see her.

17
00:00:39,766 --> 00:00:43,101
Hey, there she is.

18
00:00:43,336 --> 00:00:46,237
Hi, Uncle Matt. Thanks for coming.

19
00:00:46,272 --> 00:00:48,974
Where's your mom?

20
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:51,409
Violet, you said your
mom was gonna be here.

21
00:00:51,444 --> 00:00:52,743
What's going on?

22
00:00:54,913 --> 00:00:56,914
Hey, look at me.

23
00:01:00,785 --> 00:01:02,319
Violet?

24
00:01:02,784 --> 00:01:04,333
My mom doesn't know I'm here.

25
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:07,987
- What happened to you?
- I had a fight at school.

26
00:01:08,022 --> 00:01:11,541
I can't tell mom because
I'm already in trouble.

27
00:01:11,543 --> 00:01:13,760
Can you sign it for me?

28
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:19,882
What happened to the Latin school?

29
00:01:19,884 --> 00:01:21,718
I had to switch when we moved.

30
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,103
You moved?

31
00:01:24,139 --> 00:01:25,972
Can you sign it or not?

32
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:32,145
Yeah, I'll sign it.

33
00:01:37,068 --> 00:01:40,570
Come on, Sylvie. Come home with me.

34
00:01:40,572 --> 00:01:42,905
I told you. I just...

35
00:01:42,907 --> 00:01:45,908
I need to think about all of this.

36
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,126
You know how I feel.

37
00:01:47,162 --> 00:01:48,745
I do.

38
00:01:48,797 --> 00:01:51,380
I just...

39
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,166
don't know why.

40
00:01:53,218 --> 00:01:56,552
I mean, what changed?

41
00:01:56,588 --> 00:02:00,256
These last few months without you...

42
00:02:00,308 --> 00:02:03,092
It's not something I
ever want to get used to.

I have to go back to Fowlerton today,

45
00:02:15,323 --> 00:02:17,740
take care of a few things.

46
00:02:17,776 --> 00:02:21,694
Maybe close a deal on the Darlington house.

47
00:02:22,864 --> 00:02:25,198
You really made an offer on it?

48
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,616
I can back out any time.

49
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:29,252
I'm just hoping I don't have to.

50
00:02:31,623 --> 00:02:32,789
Oh, I'm late.

51
00:02:39,347 --> 00:02:41,631
Hey, hey, how was breakfast?

52
00:02:41,683 --> 00:02:43,132
Get this... Christie and Jim

53
00:02:43,184 --> 00:02:45,468
have jammed Violet into
some huge public school

54
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,905
in Logan Square where they now live.

55
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,640
When did all this happen?

56
00:02:50,642 --> 00:02:51,808
It must've been recently,

57
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,061
but Christie never said anything about it.

58
00:02:55,113 --> 00:02:57,146
I should know this stuff.
I'm a terrible brother.

59
00:02:57,198 --> 00:02:59,649
Hey, no, you're not.

60
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:01,200
You're definitely not.

61

All right, I'll take
Dawson and vent the roof.

you for thinking of me,

It's an open invite, all right?

when you're ready to make

- It won't be long.
- Okay.

168
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,996
Herrmann. You want to fill in

169
00:09:43,031 --> 00:09:44,864
as acting lieutenant for half an hour?

170
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:45,916
I have a little personal business.

171
00:09:45,951 --> 00:09:48,201
Yeah, sure. I guess.

172
00:09:48,203 --> 00:09:49,536
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

173
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:54,541
Watch out, boys.

174
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:57,127
Severide's looking for drinking
buddies for tomorrow night.

175
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,345
Again?

176
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,963
My liver's still mad at me for Friday.

177
00:10:00,015 --> 00:10:02,515
That guy ought to spend a
quiet night at home for once.

178
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:04,801
Yeah, well, get your excuses ready.

179
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:08,972
Yo, Truck 81, that bathroom's
looking like a warzone.

180
00:10:09,024 --> 00:10:11,241
Yo, Cap. We're not on bathroom duty.

181
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:13,026
- It's Squad's month.
- Says who?

182
00:10:13,061 --> 00:10:16,363
Says me, acting lieutenant of Truck 81.

183
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:17,731
[Men chuckling]

184
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,065
Guess that settles that.

185
00:10:20,068 --> 00:10:23,119
Joe Cruz, see you a minute?

186
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,824
Chief, I know I put Dawson and Casey

187
00:10:27,876 --> 00:10:29,075
in a tight spot up there but I...

188
00:10:29,077 --> 00:10:30,577
No, no, no, no, Joe, what you did out there

189
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:32,462
was exemplary work.

190
00:10:32,497 --> 00:10:34,748
Your quick thinking saved that man's life.

191
00:10:38,303 --> 00:10:39,919
Thank you, Chief.

192
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,672
Just glad I saw him when I did.

193
00:10:44,926 --> 00:10:47,093
It was good running that truck again.

194
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:51,147
Even if it wasn't from the driver's seat.

195
00:11:01,743 --> 00:11:02,692
Hey, Christie.

196
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:06,913
Matt, what a surprise.

197
00:11:06,948 --> 00:11:08,198
Come on in.

198
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,532
Thanks.

199
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:15,255
So, uh...

200
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,457
What happened to the house?

201
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:20,593
We just had to do a
little belt-tightening.

202
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:22,345
How did you find us?

203
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,965
I got your address off
Violet's detention slip.

204
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,935
She got into a fight, Christie.

205
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,303
That damn school.

206
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:32,172
They're supposed to be keeping
an eye on the situation.

207
00:11:32,207 --> 00:11:34,224
This isn't the first fight?

208
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,358
We're on top of it.

209
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:36,476
Jim and I have been down there.

210
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:39,145
We're gonna go again. Believe me.

211
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:41,898
What's going on with you guys?

212
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,450
It's nothing.

213
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:45,151
Just a few bad investments.

214
00:11:45,203 --> 00:11:46,486
I really need to call the school right now.

215
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:49,622
I'm worried about you, Christie.

216
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:51,124
You don't have to be.

217
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:53,159
But I'm your brother.

218
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:54,627
Let me help you.

219
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:55,879
Just don't worry about us.

220
00:11:55,914 --> 00:11:57,163
We're gonna be fine.

221
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,839
- Hey.
- Hey.

222
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,509
A bunch of us are going out
tomorrow night if you want to come.

223
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:12,011
Oh, wait, don't you have a
friend in town or something?

224
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,179
My fiancי.

225
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:15,515
Or ex... my ex-fiancי.

226
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:20,019
Actually I'm not real sure
what he is to me at the moment.

227
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:22,689
I slept with him.

228
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:25,692
Ah.

229
00:12:25,694 --> 00:12:27,444
You just got more than you
bargained for, didn't you?

230
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,362
- [Clears throat]
- Does that mean you guys

231
00:12:29,364 --> 00:12:31,414
are back together?

232
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,533
Well, he lives in Fowlerton.

233
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,337
You going back there?

234
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:40,006
No, no, no, no.

235
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,124
No.

236
00:12:41,176 --> 00:12:44,177
Good.

237
00:12:44,212 --> 00:12:45,962
Yep.

238
00:12:50,218 --> 00:12:52,268
What... what are you doing?

239
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,220
I'm wiping it down like you told me.

240
00:12:54,272 --> 00:12:56,723
It's not polish, Dawson.

241
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:57,957
It's wax.

242
00:12:57,993 --> 00:12:59,609
You got to let it dry to a haze first.

243
00:12:59,644 --> 00:13:01,561
- Ah!
- Then you buff it out.

244
00:13:01,563 --> 00:13:02,779
Right.

245
00:13:02,814 --> 00:13:04,898
You can move to another
section while you wait.

246
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,366
Then I'm gonna talk you through the rims.

247
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:08,651
They got to shine like
the day they were made.

248
00:13:08,703 --> 00:13:09,903
You're relieved, Lieutenant.

249
00:13:09,905 --> 00:13:12,739
I need to borrow Dawson for a minute.

250
00:13:12,741 --> 00:13:15,208
I'm in the middle of something.

251
00:13:15,243 --> 00:13:16,743
Herrmann, finish up will you?

252
00:13:18,663 --> 00:13:21,080
Yeah, sure. Absolutely Lieutenant.

253
00:13:21,082 --> 00:13:23,082
Take as much time as you need.

254
00:13:23,084 --> 00:13:24,551
- Christie and Jim...
- I'm...

255
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:25,919
Are basically broke.

256
00:13:25,921 --> 00:13:27,837
They've got to get their
act together, you know?

257
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:29,889
- I know, but...
- I tried to offer help,

258
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:34,010
money or something but
she's... embarrassed?

259
00:13:34,062 --> 00:13:35,395
Proud? I don't know.

260
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,263
Maybe you can talk to her?

261
00:13:37,265 --> 00:13:39,933
Can we deal with this another time?

262
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,485
I didn't always have Christie in my life.

263
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,237
Her mom brought us back together,

264
00:13:44,272 --> 00:13:46,072
because she wanted us to
be there for each other,

265
00:13:46,107 --> 00:13:49,659
and I don't feel like I've
held up my end of the bargain.

266
00:13:49,694 --> 00:13:51,578
Okay, um, well, if Christie's too proud

267
00:13:51,613 --> 00:13:53,530
to take the money, give it to Jim.

268
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,949
Thank you.

269
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,917
Uh... Herrmann?

270
00:13:57,953 --> 00:13:59,786
Maybe it's none of our business,

271
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:02,422
but how is it that you're
waxing the chief's buggy

272
00:14:02,457 --> 00:14:03,957
and not Dawson?

273
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,259
I got busted down from acting lieutenant

274
00:14:06,294 --> 00:14:08,845
all the way to candidate in one fell swoop.

275
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,930
Hey, I'm sorry about that. I can take over.

276
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:12,682
Don't worry about it. I got it.

277
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:15,802
Go on, go canoodle with your lieutenant.

278
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,554
81, in the truck.

279
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:18,938
We're taking a ride.

280
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,951
- Matt?
- Hey.

281
00:14:31,987 --> 00:14:34,871
Hey, what are you doing here?

282
00:14:34,906 --> 00:14:37,824
Uh... listen, I was
speaking to Christie earlier

283
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:39,626
about Violet's school situation.

284
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:42,795
I don't want you to
take this the wrong way,

285
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:43,963
but if there's any chance

286
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:45,999
of getting Violet back into her old school,

287
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:48,835
I'd be happy to pitch in.

288
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:51,671
That's a nice offer, but you know what?

289
00:14:51,673 --> 00:14:53,423
I think things are gonna level out a bit.

290
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,924
Once we're done with mediation

291
00:14:54,976 --> 00:14:58,344
and the divorce is, you know, finalized...

292
00:14:58,346 --> 00:15:00,680
Divorce?

293
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:03,650
What, she didn't tell you?

294
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:05,268
Jim, what happened?

295
00:15:05,303 --> 00:15:08,404
Well, lots of little things
piling up over the years.

296
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,074
And financial problems
certainly take their toll.

297
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:13,359
We have got to find a
new coffee place, babe.

298
00:15:13,361 --> 00:15:15,528
That line is just...

299
00:15:20,785 --> 00:15:22,702
Jim, is everything okay?

300
00:15:24,422 --> 00:15:27,373
Why wouldn't everything be okay?

301
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:30,793
Matt.

302
00:15:35,183 --> 00:15:37,884
You're a real piece of work.

303
00:15:49,474 --> 00:15:51,275
She called him babe.
I think it's a safe bet

304
00:15:51,311 --> 00:15:52,966
they're sleeping together.

305
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,316
I mean, you're probably right,

306
00:15:54,368 --> 00:15:56,234
but maybe Christie already knows.

307
00:15:56,236 --> 00:15:58,553
Maybe.

308
00:15:58,589 --> 00:15:59,755
I don't like it.

309
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,107
Baby, I wouldn't read too much into this.

310
00:16:02,142 --> 00:16:03,608
Divorce makes people act crazy.

311
00:16:03,644 --> 00:16:05,827
That's my point. Something's up.

312
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:08,430
And what do we really
know about Jim anyway?

313
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,583
I want to check this guy out.

314
00:16:11,618 --> 00:16:13,668
Let's get Antonio involved.

315
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,221
He and Laura are... [groans]

316
00:16:16,256 --> 00:16:17,506
They're going through
the same thing right now.

317
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:18,673
- I'd leave him out of it.
- Wait,

318
00:16:18,725 --> 00:16:21,259
what about what's his name, Halstead?

319
00:16:22,496 --> 00:16:27,432
Mm, better idea. You know, um, Adam Ruzek?

320
00:16:27,434 --> 00:16:30,185
- Mm-hmm?
- Antonio trusts him.

321
00:16:30,237 --> 00:16:32,154
I'll reach out.

322
00:16:36,326 --> 00:16:38,243
Oh, uh-oh, it's not gonna work.

323
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:45,020
Look, Joe...

324
00:16:45,022 --> 00:16:47,155
We need to have a talk, okay?

325
00:16:47,191 --> 00:16:49,774
Before this turns into a thing.

326
00:16:49,826 --> 00:16:52,244
Now, I know how important
driving the truck is to you...

327
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,612
No, Otis...

328
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:57,515
But I didn't ask to be
your replacement, right?

329
00:16:57,551 --> 00:16:59,334
Now, when the starting
quarterback gets hurt

330
00:16:59,369 --> 00:17:01,369
and the coach has to put in the backup QB,

331
00:17:01,371 --> 00:17:02,787
that's just the way it is.

332
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,674
There's no time for bruised egos, Cruz.

333
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:09,211
We're all one team, man.

334
00:17:09,263 --> 00:17:12,097
I say this as a friend.

335
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,882
The engine needs to be running in order

336
00:17:13,884 --> 00:17:16,635
to get an accurate level
on the transmission fluid.

337
00:17:23,894 --> 00:17:26,194
Incredible, she did it again.

338
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,698
She left the flipping
compartment door open.

339
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:31,283
So say something then.

340
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:34,736
What's the point? Casey's
just gonna tell me to close it.

341
00:17:35,906 --> 00:17:38,039
[Ahem]

342
00:17:38,075 --> 00:17:41,876
Can all those involved with
Molly's please follow me?

343
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,747
- Uh-oh.
- Okay.

344
00:17:53,757 --> 00:17:57,008
Approximately how long can I
expect my beautiful firehouse

345
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,394
to be defiled by this atrocity?

346
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:00,562
Sorry, Chief.

347
00:18:00,597 --> 00:18:04,899
It's not exactly running at the moment.

348
00:18:04,935 --> 00:18:06,735
We'll get it out of here, soon.

349
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,270
I hope so...

350
00:18:08,272 --> 00:18:11,072
or you'll have bigger problems
than a few parking tickets.

351
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:23,168
160 bucks.

352
00:18:26,123 --> 00:18:28,757
I can totally take care of these.

353
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,512
I got those forms for you, Chief.

354
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:37,132
- Perfect, thank you.
- Chief, you got a sec?

355
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:41,519
Connie, may I?

356
00:18:47,027 --> 00:18:48,777
Chief, uh...

357
00:18:48,812 --> 00:18:52,364
You know how I don't like going
outside the chain of command.

358
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:54,282
Uh-huh.

359
00:18:54,318 --> 00:18:56,201
But this situation with Dawson...

360
00:18:59,323 --> 00:19:01,873
Go on.

361
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:04,326
You're gonna make me say it?

362
00:19:04,328 --> 00:19:05,410
Oh, God.

363
00:19:05,462 --> 00:19:07,829
Chief, it ain't working.

364
00:19:07,831 --> 00:19:10,999
I mean, you saw it, all right?

365
00:19:11,001 --> 00:19:14,803
Casey's venting the roof
so he can look out for her?

366
00:19:14,838 --> 00:19:17,172
I mean, how many candidates has he had?

367
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:20,008
You ever see him vent the roof with one?

368
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,843
May I remind you what
it was like around here

369
00:19:21,845 --> 00:19:23,812
in the wake of Shay's death?

370
00:19:23,847 --> 00:19:25,814
A big reason we're getting
past that is Dawson's decision

371
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:26,898
to stay on at ambulance.

372
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:28,516
We owe her.

373
00:19:28,518 --> 00:19:30,018
Absolutely.

374
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,853
But when you rewarded her with a spot

375
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:33,355
on 81, you didn't ask any of us

376
00:19:33,357 --> 00:19:37,776
how we felt about having a
candidate date our lieutenant.

377
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:40,278
And we're the ones that
got to deal with it.

378
00:19:41,998 --> 00:19:47,085
I have absolute faith that you
will find a way to deal with it.

379
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:50,422
Got it, Chief.

380
00:19:50,474 --> 00:19:53,224
Message received.

381
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:59,647
[Siren blaring]

382
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:11,643
What do we got?

383
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,445
Guy could use some medical attention.

384
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:20,535
[Chuckles] Hmm.

385
00:20:20,537 --> 00:20:22,120
Get ready.

386
00:20:22,172 --> 00:20:24,372
- What is he on?
- You're the medic.

387
00:20:24,374 --> 00:20:25,874
So what, you call us here

388
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:27,709
to help cut down on your paperwork?

389
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:30,962
Can't click a guy up for
rocking a banana hammock.

390
00:20:31,014 --> 00:20:32,964
Chicago's finest, huh?

391
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,800
You got a name, big fella?

392
00:20:35,852 --> 00:20:38,186
- [Snarling]
- Whoa, hey, hey!

393
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:46,910
[Snarling]

394
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,305
10 milligrams of versed to help him sleep.

395
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,341
Ha. Against regulations.

396
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,649
Nice and easy. We're gonna
take care of you, okay?

397
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,235
[Both grunting]

398
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,668
The hell with regulation.

399
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:33,873
Oh, man.

400
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:35,792
Good lookin' out.

401
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,130
What do you got going on today?

402
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,798
Nothing, man. I'm gonna go
home and sit on the couch...

403
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,466
Hey, guys.

404
00:21:43,518 --> 00:21:45,135
You coming tonight?

405
00:21:45,187 --> 00:21:47,971
Tipsy Tuesday at McGillicuddy's.

406
00:21:48,023 --> 00:21:49,472
Both: Tonight, uh?

407
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:50,807
- What's today?
- You know what?

408
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:53,977
- I got this thing.
- Whatever, you guys suck.

409
00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:56,313
[Phone chiming]

410
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,698
Hold on.

411
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,367
Oh, yeah.

412
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,453
My nephews are gonna come
visit the house next shift.

413
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,956
Hmm, that's exciting news, apparently.

414
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,159
Oh, they get to see me
drive the truck. No offense.

415
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:11,077
They're gonna lose their minds!

416
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,164
Yeah, good for you, bro.

417
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,051
Well, look at this.

418
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,170
It must be Christmas or something.

419
00:22:20,222 --> 00:22:21,504
Hiya, Trudy.

420
00:22:21,556 --> 00:22:23,673
Morning, Sergeant.

421
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,842
I'm meeting Adam Ruzek down here.

422
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,510
That's him right there.

423
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,846
Thank you.

424
00:22:29,898 --> 00:22:31,398
What's the deal? He need a grown-up

425
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,183
to hold his hand on the walk down here?

426
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,853
Aw, no, I just thought
I'd pop by to see you.

427
00:22:36,905 --> 00:22:37,937
That's nice.

428
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,407
I like that.

429
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:45,328
Oh, and then there's this
bit of unpleasant business.

430
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,746
Oh, parking tickets.

431
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,198
- The worst.
- Right?

432
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:52,369
I thought I could get a little
assistance dealing with these.

433
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,454
Sure, just go down the stairs,

434
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,956
take a left and the
cashier's at window five.

435
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:02,045
Oh, okay.

436
00:23:02,097 --> 00:23:03,380
Thanks.

437
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,465
You come by anytime.

438
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,136
I realize this is a big
ask and you don't owe me

439
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:12,972
anything, but my sister isn't
thinking straight right now.

440
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:14,691
I just need to know what's really going on.

441
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,143
Well, fair enough. What's
Jim's last name again?

442
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:18,361
Jim Jordan

443
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,280
- of Jordan Development.
- Jordan Development.

444
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,899
All right, okay, I will
do some poking around.

445
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,818
I can't run a wire or anything like that,

446
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,070
but I can figure out a lot
without getting too dirty.

447
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,288
All right, thanks.

448
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,789
- I owe you.
- All right, man.

449
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:30,907
I'll get back to you, all right?

450
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,242
Okay.

451
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,878
Thanks for seeing me, Chief.

452
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:35,995
How's Gretchen doing?

453
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:37,247
Great.

454
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,215
Working at some fancy store on Mag Mile

455
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,500
while she finishes up her degree.

456
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:43,286
Oh, good for her. Give
her my best, will you?

457
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:45,972
I want to talk about Joe Cruz.

458
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,641
He had a hell of a save yesterday and...

459
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,777
I'd like him back behind the wheel.

460
00:23:50,812 --> 00:23:52,796
He's on three months' suspension.

461
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:55,098
I realize that. But you and I
both know he was not at fault

462
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,517
in that crash. He really stepped up,

463
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,769
and I believe he should
be rewarded for that.

464
00:23:59,821 --> 00:24:01,771
So, put in for a commendation.

465
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,476
Driving's what really matters to him.

466
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:10,530
There's nothing I can do.

467
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:16,486
Okay, but you do know I
may... take this upstairs.

468
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:20,457
Rattling cages like that
takes a toll on your career.

469
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,592
You ready to risk that
just because your guy

470
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,294
really wants to drive the truck?

471
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,467
I do my job. I do it well.

472
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,470
When I punch out, that's my business.

473
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,855
It most certainly is.

474
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,307
Everybody's on my ass for the drinking,

475
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:38,775
but I don't bring that to work.

476
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,812
My point is I do my job

477
00:24:42,864 --> 00:24:45,899
and the day I show up to work
drunk, I'm telling you, Connie,

478
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:47,984
and I mean this, you can fire me.

479
00:24:48,036 --> 00:24:49,786
All right.

480
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,154
I will.

481
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,125
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

482
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,224
No, no, no.

that was in that wooden box.

00:25:58,772 --> 00:26:00,105
Give it back.

494
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:11,399
Get out! Leave!

[Panting]

496
00:26:22,045 --> 00:26:25,380
Hey, Mouch, did you get those
parking tickets taken care of?

497
00:26:25,415 --> 00:26:26,748
You know it.

498
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,250
My girl, Trudy, she takes good care of me.

499
00:26:29,252 --> 00:26:32,170
Awesome. 'Cause we got three more.

500
00:26:36,927 --> 00:26:38,426
I'll handle it.

501
00:26:41,148 --> 00:26:42,097
Hey, Ruzek.

502
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:43,765
Matt, hey, you got a second?

503
00:26:43,767 --> 00:26:45,350
We should talk in private.

504
00:26:45,402 --> 00:26:47,402
Yeah.

505
00:26:47,437 --> 00:26:51,656
Well, your instincts were spot on.

506
00:26:51,691 --> 00:26:53,158
This cat Jim and his receptionist

507
00:26:53,193 --> 00:26:55,610
are definitely hanging out.

508
00:26:55,662 --> 00:26:57,412
It gets worse, man.

509
00:26:57,447 --> 00:26:59,581
You said that he and Christie are broke?

510
00:26:59,616 --> 00:27:01,366
- Yeah?
- Yeah, no.

511
00:27:01,418 --> 00:27:04,786
By the looks of it, his
company is doing just fine.

512
00:27:04,838 --> 00:27:07,122
For the last year at least
he's been playing a sort

513
00:27:07,124 --> 00:27:09,958
of shell game to keep his assets
out of your sister's reach.

514
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,762
He can't get away with this.

515
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:15,880
Right?

516
00:27:15,932 --> 00:27:17,465
He can.

517
00:27:17,517 --> 00:27:20,718
He relinquished control of
the company to a third party,

518
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:24,222
Keri Hathaway. Do you know who that is?

519
00:27:24,274 --> 00:27:26,608
- The receptionist.
- Mm-hmm.

520
00:27:26,643 --> 00:27:28,893
So, bottom line is if your sister

521
00:27:28,945 --> 00:27:30,895
signs off on any sort
of mediation agreement,

522
00:27:30,947 --> 00:27:32,730
this jackass will get all of the assets,

523
00:27:32,782 --> 00:27:36,317
and there's not a damn thing
anybody can do about it.

524
00:27:36,369 --> 00:27:38,036
All right.

525
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,324
Sorry, man.

526
00:27:43,326 --> 00:27:46,044
Listen, if you need anything
else I got your back, all right?

527
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:48,046
- Let me know.
- Okay.

- Sylvie?
- Hey.

00:27:58,308 --> 00:27:59,507
I'm sorry I couldn't get here sooner.

531

Oh, it's okay.

532
00:28:00,644 --> 00:28:03,311
- I'm okay.
- Really?

533
00:28:03,346 --> 00:28:04,846
You sounded pretty upset on the phone.

534
00:28:04,848 --> 00:28:08,066
- I was, but you know...
- I've taken care of everything.

535
00:28:08,101 --> 00:28:09,317
I've already reserved the u-haul,

536
00:28:09,352 --> 00:28:12,270
and I can start packing
your things up right away.

Uh...

538
00:28:20,697 --> 00:28:23,831
Harrison, I haven't decided to leave.

539
00:28:23,867 --> 00:28:26,451
Someone broke into your apartment.

540
00:28:26,503 --> 00:28:30,705
They almost attacked
you. You can't stay here.

541
00:28:30,757 --> 00:28:34,192
You can't handle this kind of life.

542
00:28:34,227 --> 00:28:36,044
But I did.

543
00:28:36,096 --> 00:28:37,545
I did handle it.

544
00:28:37,597 --> 00:28:39,380
I mean, I actually picked up a baseball bat

545
00:28:39,382 --> 00:28:43,017
and yelled at the guy, and he freaked out.

546
00:28:43,053 --> 00:28:44,769
That's nuts.

547
00:28:46,473 --> 00:28:48,273
Yeah, I guess it kind of was.

548
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:52,560
It's funny...

549
00:28:56,366 --> 00:28:58,566
I came to Chicago to escape what happened

550
00:28:58,618 --> 00:29:01,653
with you and me, but now,

551
00:29:01,705 --> 00:29:04,739
I think this is the right place for me.

552
00:29:04,791 --> 00:29:10,461
But that doesn't mean we
have to stop being together.

Sylvie, I hate to say this,

554
00:29:14,751 --> 00:29:16,584
but I don't think you're dealing

555
00:29:16,586 --> 00:29:20,255
with the reality of all of this.

556
00:29:20,257 --> 00:29:23,308
I mean, sooner or later, this
is going to be another one

557
00:29:23,343 --> 00:29:28,046
of those things that
you just... give up on.

I haven't felt it since I left Fowlerton,

almost forgot about it.

00:34:59,927 --> 00:35:01,260
Will you repair the food truck

658
00:35:01,262 --> 00:35:03,095
if 81 takes over Squad's bathroom duty

659
00:35:03,097 --> 00:35:04,763
- for the rest of the year?
- Mouch.

660
00:35:04,815 --> 00:35:06,015
Hey! Mouch!

661
00:35:06,067 --> 00:35:08,267
Deal.

662
00:35:08,269 --> 00:35:11,103
Hey, Joe. I got some good news for you.

663
00:35:11,105 --> 00:35:14,440
- You are back on the wheel.
- Say what?

664
00:35:14,492 --> 00:35:17,776
Your driving suspension has been withdrawn.

665
00:35:17,778 --> 00:35:20,946
Congratulations.

666
00:35:20,948 --> 00:35:23,115
You go to church or something recently?

667
00:35:23,167 --> 00:35:25,000
Sometimes you got to believe, brother.

668
00:35:25,036 --> 00:35:26,952
[Laughing]

669
00:35:26,954 --> 00:35:28,454
Hey, Otis!

670
00:35:28,506 --> 00:35:30,789
Coach Bowden called me into his office!

671
00:35:30,841 --> 00:35:34,293
Are you guys ready for
the ride of your lives?

672
00:35:34,345 --> 00:35:37,263
Hey, Joe.

673
00:35:37,298 --> 00:35:39,848
Man, what are you doing?

674
00:35:39,884 --> 00:35:42,351
I'm so sorry, Otis.

675
00:35:42,386 --> 00:35:45,387
Ha. Nephews, meet Joe Cruz.

676
00:35:45,439 --> 00:35:49,475
Joe loves to pretend he drives the truck.

677
00:35:49,527 --> 00:35:52,361
<i>- Okay.
- Na zdorovie.</i>

678
00:35:52,396 --> 00:35:53,779
All right, get in there.

679
00:35:53,814 --> 00:35:54,947
[Growling]

680
00:36:14,585 --> 00:36:17,419
Really? You're really
not gonna say anything?

681
00:36:17,471 --> 00:36:20,055
Why do you keep letting
me get away with that?

682
00:36:20,091 --> 00:36:22,057
You mean...

683
00:36:22,093 --> 00:36:24,560
you were doing it on purpose?

684
00:36:24,595 --> 00:36:26,145
For days now, yeah.

685
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,063
And you haven't said a word.

686
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:30,349
This was my worst fear,
Herrmann, that you guys

687
00:36:30,401 --> 00:36:32,351
weren't gonna treat me
like any other candidate.

688
00:36:32,403 --> 00:36:35,904
Dawson, if you wanted to be
treated like any other candidate

689
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,439
you would've cooled your heels

690
00:36:37,491 --> 00:36:39,658
and waited for a spot
to open in another house.

691
00:36:39,694 --> 00:36:42,578
- Now we're gonna do this?
- Yeah, we are.

692
00:36:42,613 --> 00:36:46,365
'Cause you insisted on working
under Casey and now here we are.

693
00:36:48,869 --> 00:36:50,836
I want you to succeed, Dawson.

694
00:36:50,871 --> 00:36:53,872
I want to see that. I really do.

695
00:36:53,924 --> 00:36:55,457
But you got to admit

696
00:36:55,509 --> 00:37:00,129
that the dynamics of this situation are...

697
00:37:00,181 --> 00:37:02,965
challenging.

698
00:37:03,017 --> 00:37:05,684
Okay, so, take me off of Casey's hands

699
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,720
and let me shadow you on calls.

700
00:37:07,772 --> 00:37:09,638
You want to be on my hip?

701
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:12,558
Yeah, I think I could learn a lot from you.

702
00:37:17,732 --> 00:37:20,816
- Okay.
- Okay.

703
00:37:20,868 --> 00:37:24,370
You can start by closing
your compartment doors.

704
00:37:24,405 --> 00:37:25,621
Copy that.

705
00:37:35,383 --> 00:37:37,466
And this has been going on for a year?

706
00:37:37,501 --> 00:37:39,118
At least.

707
00:37:39,153 --> 00:37:40,469
Maybe longer.

708
00:37:40,504 --> 00:37:42,971
[Sobbing]

709
00:37:43,007 --> 00:37:44,973
I thought we could work it out.

710
00:37:45,009 --> 00:37:48,644
- I know.
- He allowed me to believe that.

711
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:51,263
You don't have to go
through this alone, Christie.

712
00:37:51,315 --> 00:37:52,564
I'll be right by your side.

713
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,016
We're gonna get you a good lawyer.

714
00:37:54,068 --> 00:37:57,436
No, I'm... I'm tired of fighting.

715
00:37:57,438 --> 00:38:00,272
I just want to settle
this and be done with it.

716
00:38:00,274 --> 00:38:03,325
Chrissy, you can't let
him get away with this.

717
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,528
Matt, it's my life and I
just want to get on with it.

718
00:38:14,038 --> 00:38:15,621
Mom?

719
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:18,624
Hey.

720
00:38:23,264 --> 00:38:27,800
Listen, I've been where you are, Violet.

721
00:38:27,852 --> 00:38:30,803
It's gonna be okay.

722
00:38:30,805 --> 00:38:34,473
I promise you that.

723
00:38:34,525 --> 00:38:36,809
Come here.

724
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,149
You sure you're okay?

725
00:38:44,151 --> 00:38:45,984
I'm fine.

726
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:50,405
Don't beat yourself up.

727
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:52,875
You can't fight this
battle for her, you know?

728
00:38:59,049 --> 00:39:01,333
- Hey.
- Hey, Chief.

729
00:39:01,335 --> 00:39:02,501
Don't act so damned surprised.

730
00:39:02,503 --> 00:39:03,919
I have been in a bar before, Lieutenant.

731
00:39:03,971 --> 00:39:08,173
No, I know. Just, don't see you here much.

732
00:39:08,175 --> 00:39:09,675
Donna wanted some time to herself.

733
00:39:09,677 --> 00:39:12,511
She's been a little...

734
00:39:12,513 --> 00:39:14,813
unpredictable lately.

735
00:39:16,867 --> 00:39:19,518
Chief, can I ask you a question?

736
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,821
What did it cost you to
get Cruz off his suspension?

737
00:39:22,857 --> 00:39:24,940
I won't be included in the
next round of promotions.

738
00:39:24,992 --> 00:39:26,441
That much I know.

739
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:32,748
But we got to stand up for our people.

740
00:39:32,783 --> 00:39:35,450
Even if it's a tough fight.

741
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,456
All right, boys. Chop, chop.

742
00:39:41,509 --> 00:39:42,841
[Overlapping chatter]

743
00:39:42,877 --> 00:39:44,676
You know what we need?

744
00:39:44,712 --> 00:39:46,879
All of us?

745
00:39:46,881 --> 00:39:49,264
A Vegas weekend.

746
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,799
What weekend?

747
00:39:50,851 --> 00:39:52,768
- Next weekend.
- [Laughter]

748
00:39:52,803 --> 00:39:55,387
Come on!

749
00:39:55,389 --> 00:39:57,890
I don't know. You need
a little more lead time,

750
00:39:57,942 --> 00:39:59,808
or you get crushed on the airfare.

751
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,977
Oh, never mind.

752
00:40:02,029 --> 00:40:03,896
Come on, all right, this
is a squad trip only.

753
00:40:03,948 --> 00:40:04,947
We're going to Vegas.

754
00:40:04,982 --> 00:40:06,231
That's an order.

755
00:40:06,233 --> 00:40:09,785
- Yeah, sure. Good.
- [Laughter]

756
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,286
Hey, look who it is.

757
00:40:11,322 --> 00:40:12,821
- Hey.
- What's happening, Sylvie?

758
00:40:12,873 --> 00:40:14,072
Hey, guys.

759
00:40:14,074 --> 00:40:16,375
How you doing? You okay?

760
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,460
Yeah, yeah, I am.

761
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,413
That's good. Cheers. Grab a seat.

762
00:40:21,465 --> 00:40:23,999
- You want to get down on this?
- Come on, girl.

763

[Laugther, chatter]

764
00:40:37,598 --> 00:40:39,848
I'm gonna make a firefighter out of you.

765
00:40:42,436 --> 00:40:44,820
That's exactly what I want.

766
00:41:01,455 --> 00:41:03,038
Shut up and listen, Jim.

767
00:41:05,092 --> 00:41:07,859
I'm gonna come to your
office at 8:00 A.M. sharp,

768
00:41:07,895 --> 00:41:12,214
and we're gonna take a long
hard look at your books.

769
00:41:12,266 --> 00:41:15,767
So, Keri...

770
00:41:15,803 --> 00:41:17,853
Why don't you have those ready, huh?

771
00:41:19,223 --> 00:41:20,856
I don't know what Christie told you...

772
00:41:20,891 --> 00:41:24,810
One more word, and I'll
knock you flat on your ass.

773
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:33,652
8:00 A.M.

774
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:38,573

1
00:00:00,296 --> 00:00:02,023
You came all the way up here
to check on me?

2
00:00:02,109 --> 00:00:05,959
I heard about this opening
for a pediatric nurse.

3
00:00:05,984 --> 00:00:08,360
You're the one who took the job at Med.

4
00:00:08,553 --> 00:00:09,620
Glad she's back.

5
00:00:09,654 --> 00:00:11,118
Yeah, she's good for you, Kelly.

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,054
I'm rooting for this.

7
00:00:14,356 --> 00:00:16,079
Hey.

8
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:18,896
Hey, Otis, you hear of this thing,

9
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,532
the, uh, Drunken Mile?

10
00:00:21,866 --> 00:00:24,335
Yeah, it's the pub crawl. Why?

11
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:26,775
Yeah... well, there's one
this Saturday coming up,

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,072
and there's an open spot.

13
00:00:29,407 --> 00:00:31,041
No.

14
00:00:31,076 --> 00:00:32,523
Why not?

15
00:00:32,548 --> 00:00:34,387
Because I've done the Drunken Mile

16
00:00:34,412 --> 00:00:36,680
and it's a bunch of rowdy morons

17
00:00:36,715 --> 00:00:38,248
puking in the back booths.

18
00:00:38,283 --> 00:00:41,085
Trust me, it's not the kind of crowd
you want at Molly's.

19
00:00:42,387 --> 00:00:44,088
Matthew Casey, where you at?

20
00:00:45,123 --> 00:00:46,270
Who the hell is that?

21
00:00:46,295 --> 00:00:47,925
Alderman Casey, I'm calling you out!

22
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:49,354
- Excuse me, sir...
- Whoa!

23
00:00:49,387 --> 00:00:51,929
You don't sneak up on a man
that's trained in hand-to-hand combat.

24
00:00:51,963 --> 00:00:54,131
Easy there, friend. No need for that.

25
00:00:54,165 --> 00:00:56,133
What's going on in here?

26
00:00:56,167 --> 00:00:57,443
Tell Alderman Casey

27
00:00:57,468 --> 00:00:58,945
Max Schlottman is here to see him.

28
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,371
Mr. Schlottman.

29
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:01,805
- Friend of yours?
- Uh-huh.

30
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,707
How come you don't
return my calls, Alderman?

31
00:01:03,742 --> 00:01:04,875
You too good for me, huh?

32
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:08,212
I'm very sorry, Mr. Schlottman,
but, listen, here's the thing.

33
00:01:08,246 --> 00:01:10,948
I don't handle ward business
when I'm on shift.

34
00:01:10,982 --> 00:01:12,216
Yeah, but I call your office,

35
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,859
- you won't call me back.
- I get lots of calls.

36
00:01:14,884 --> 00:01:17,152
Mm. Tell you what.

37
00:01:17,255 --> 00:01:19,223
Put your concerns down in a letter

38
00:01:19,257 --> 00:01:21,671
and I'll read it, I promise.

39
00:01:21,696 --> 00:01:22,893
Okay.

40
00:01:22,927 --> 00:01:25,095
We'll try it that way.

41
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,232
It's good to see you, Mr. Schlottman.

42
00:01:28,266 --> 00:01:31,092
- I won't be ignored!
- I understand.

43
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,991
Bye.

44
00:01:34,339 --> 00:01:36,814
So another satisfied constituent?

45
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:38,976
Sorry about that, guys.

46
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,277
Marcy, you okay?

47
00:01:40,311 --> 00:01:42,203
- Yeah, I'm good.
- All right.

48
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:45,337
<i>Squad 3, Ambulance 61.</i>

49
00:01:45,486 --> 00:01:49,253
<i>Pin-in accident.
5200 block, West 26th Street.</i>

50
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,972
Hey, Cruz, grab the Hurst.

51
00:02:13,154 --> 00:02:15,022
Copy that.

52
00:02:15,113 --> 00:02:16,280
What happened?

53
00:02:16,314 --> 00:02:18,849
Uh, I found 'em like this.

54
00:02:18,883 --> 00:02:21,118
Uh, driver's pretty messed up.

55
00:02:21,152 --> 00:02:24,355
- I tried to open the door, but...
- All right, hey, just hang back.

56
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:25,923
All right, everybody back up!

57
00:02:25,957 --> 00:02:28,875
- Driver's pulse is thready.
- You okay, honey?

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,546
All right, we have a child in the back.
We need a second ambulance.

59
00:02:31,571 --> 00:02:33,734
Main, this is 61, we need
an additional ambulance.

60
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:36,824
We got two victims,
one child, one adult, both red.

61
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:39,098
<i>Roger that, 61.
Second ambo's on the way.</i>

62
00:02:39,123 --> 00:02:40,762
Something came through the windshield.

63
00:02:40,824 --> 00:02:42,625
Yeah. Concrete.

64
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:43,878
Must have hit her in the head.

65
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,017
Uh, maybe a truck
kicked it up or something?

66
00:02:46,044 --> 00:02:48,012
Eh, something that big, I don't know.

67
00:02:50,982 --> 00:02:53,514
Brett, how's the driver?

68
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:56,600
Ma'am? Ma'am, can you hear me?

69
00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:00,048
Checking for anisocoria.

70
00:03:00,278 --> 00:03:02,026
My name's Kelly. What's your name, bud?

71
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,527
I'm Zach.

72
00:03:03,562 --> 00:03:05,129
Hold on, Zach, we're gonna
get you out of there.

73
00:03:05,163 --> 00:03:07,358
How old are ya?

74
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:09,863
Where's Layla? She was right here.

75
00:03:09,968 --> 00:03:11,301
Who's Layla?

76
00:03:11,529 --> 00:03:12,937
She's my baby sister.

77
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:15,272
Where'd she go?

78
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:23,732

79
00:03:26,393 --> 00:03:27,861
Okay, people, we need a hand.

80
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:29,040
There was a baby in the backseat.

81
00:03:29,065 --> 00:03:30,942
- We need to find her.
- Oh, dear Lord.

82
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:32,288
Brett, you good with the driver?

83
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:34,169
Yeah, I got her. Go.

84
00:03:34,203 --> 00:03:36,263
Looks like the car
started rolling over there,

85
00:03:36,288 --> 00:03:38,640
and the baby could have been thrown out
at any point along the way.

86
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:44,646
Can I help?

87
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:46,014
No, you stay here, bud.

88
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:48,225
I'm gonna stay right here with you.

89
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:51,098
Hey, Dawson.

90
00:03:51,123 --> 00:03:54,090
Maybe the concrete fell off the bridge.

91
00:03:54,257 --> 00:03:56,224
Yeah. Maybe.

92
00:03:56,259 --> 00:03:58,060
Anybody else hear that?

93
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:01,029
Hey, quiet!

94
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,386
Oh, my God!

95
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:13,008
We got her! She's alive!

96
00:04:13,042 --> 00:04:14,712
Hey, uh, Capp, grab a pry bar!

97
00:04:14,737 --> 00:04:16,545
- Got it.
- Nice work, bud.

98
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,880
Can't believe she's alive.

99
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,485
Hey, sweetie.

100
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:25,187
You're gonna be okay.

101
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:29,987
You're gonna be okay.

102
00:04:30,126 --> 00:04:33,128
- Heads up, Dawson.
- Yeah.

103
00:04:49,124 --> 00:04:50,579
She's okay.

104
00:04:50,898 --> 00:04:52,116
She's okay!

105
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:55,984
It's a miracle.
It's an honest-to-God miracle.

106
00:04:59,322 --> 00:05:01,383
She's okay.

107
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,453
You saved her life.

108
00:05:05,628 --> 00:05:08,330
Give me some space, people.
Give me some space.

109
00:05:13,893 --> 00:05:16,190
Okay, folks, let's move it out, come on.

110
00:05:20,309 --> 00:05:22,062
Where's Mommy and Layla?

111
00:05:22,087 --> 00:05:23,162
They'll be here soon, bud.

112
00:05:23,187 --> 00:05:25,280
My friends Gabby and Sylvie
are taking care of them.

113
00:05:25,314 --> 00:05:26,448
Rollover accident.

114
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:28,417
Contusions to the chest and stomach.

115
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:31,219
Possible rib fractures.
Pressure is 110 over palp.

116
00:05:31,254 --> 00:05:32,320
Okay, call for X-ray.

117
00:05:32,355 --> 00:05:33,955
Hey, Kelly, who's your friend?

118
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,557
This is my buddy Zach.

119
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:37,592
Hey, Zach, I'm Anna.

120
00:05:39,812 --> 00:05:41,646
Hey, Zach, I gotta get back to work,

121
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:44,649
but this is my friend Anna.
She's gonna take care of you.

122
00:05:44,684 --> 00:05:46,077
She's pretty good at this stuff.

123
00:05:46,102 --> 00:05:49,937
Nah, don't listen to him.
I'm really good at this stuff.

124
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:52,290
See ya, bud.

125
00:05:52,325 --> 00:05:54,192
Bye, Kelly.

126
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,936
Not a mark on her.

127
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:07,019
Laying there like she was taking a nap.

128
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:08,625
Never heard anything like it.

129
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,391
- Hey.
- It's amazing.

130
00:06:12,268 --> 00:06:14,069
So we heard about your call.

131
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,477
What's the upshot?

132
00:06:15,517 --> 00:06:17,217
Boy's a little banged up,
but he'll be okay.

133
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,585
Mom, not so much.

134
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,254
She has severe head trauma.

135
00:06:20,288 --> 00:06:22,422
But it will be a while
before we know how bad it is.

136
00:06:22,457 --> 00:06:23,757
What about the baby?

137
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:25,440
Baby's perfectly fine.

138
00:06:25,487 --> 00:06:26,560
They didn't believe us.

139
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:29,396
Thrown from a car,
landed in a storm grate,

140
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,564
not a scratch on her?

141
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,199
Her harness wasn't tight enough.

142
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:33,309
Car started rolling,

143
00:06:33,371 --> 00:06:35,699
centrifugal force just flung her out.

144
00:06:35,804 --> 00:06:37,104
- It's incredible.
- Mm.

145
00:06:37,138 --> 00:06:39,339
God looks after babies and fools.

146
00:06:39,374 --> 00:06:41,208
Oh, you hear that, Capp? You're in luck.

147
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,345
Hey, the cops say anything
about how the accident happened?

148
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,446
Don't know.

149
00:06:46,481 --> 00:06:48,882
We just swept up the glass,
came back to the house.

150
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:50,617
You tell them about
the chunk of concrete?

151
00:06:50,652 --> 00:06:51,752
Yeah.

152
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,453
They gonna do anything about it?

153
00:06:53,488 --> 00:06:55,589
Don't know. I assume so.

154
00:07:01,396 --> 00:07:02,502
Hey, Chief.

155
00:07:02,527 --> 00:07:04,598
Sorry about that
little intrusion earlier.

156
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,238
- Won't happen again.
- What was the issue?

157
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:10,548
Uh, one of my constituents,
looking for me.

158
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,683
What'd he want?

159
00:07:12,774 --> 00:07:15,542
Name it, it's a
different complaint every time.

160
00:07:15,577 --> 00:07:17,274
Last month, he asked me to do something

161
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,313
about Daylight Savings Time.

162
00:07:19,414 --> 00:07:21,571
Guy's a crackpot.

163
00:07:21,683 --> 00:07:23,884
The prevailing wisdom
among council members is

164
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:26,753
guys like him you just
gotta keep at arm's length,

165
00:07:26,788 --> 00:07:28,555
otherwise they'll never leave you alone.

166
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,915
Well, I would like you to keep him

167
00:07:29,962 --> 00:07:33,227
a bit more than arm's length
away from my firehouse.

168
00:07:33,407 --> 00:07:36,347
Understood. Won't happen again.

169
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,668
Thank you.

170
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,237
Wow, this is some high-end work here.

171
00:07:43,271 --> 00:07:45,272
It's a big event, I'm telling you.

172
00:07:45,306 --> 00:07:47,056
All right, so where
would the Molly's logo go?

173
00:07:47,081 --> 00:07:49,167
- Okay, okay, okay...
- Hey, hey, what's all this?

174
00:07:49,192 --> 00:07:50,947
Hey, check it out.
It's pretty fancy, huh?

175
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:52,050
Mm-hmm.

176
00:07:52,075 --> 00:07:53,680
I... I thought we weren't
doing the bar crawl.

177
00:07:53,715 --> 00:07:56,409
No. Kidd's all for it.

178
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,819
Kidd is not an equity partner.

179
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,954
Look, it's a great way
to bring in new business.

180
00:08:00,989 --> 00:08:03,290
Plus, we'll make
a ton of cash in one night.

181
00:08:03,324 --> 00:08:04,458
I mean, what's not to like?

182
00:08:04,492 --> 00:08:07,327
Uh, the massive amounts of vomit,

183
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,829
the out-of-pocket expenses,

184
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,197
just to name a few things.

185
00:08:10,231 --> 00:08:11,365
Hey, Dawson.

186
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,121
You don't want Molly's involved
in the Drunken Mile crawl, do you?

187
00:08:14,146 --> 00:08:15,802
Uh, whatever you guys want.

188
00:08:15,837 --> 00:08:18,372
- Yeah, good, 'cause we're doing it.
- Yep.

189
00:08:19,908 --> 00:08:23,589
Finally tracked down the cop
investigating the 26th Street accident.

190
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,870
He says that none of the
witnesses saw anything weird

191
00:08:25,932 --> 00:08:27,538
so he put it at the bottom of his pile.

192
00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:29,182
- Mm.
- You believe that?

193
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,484
I'm sure he'll get to it.

194
00:08:30,518 --> 00:08:31,985
Yeah, I hope so.

195
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,200
All he wanted to talk about
was the miracle baby.

196
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:36,130
Hm.

197
00:08:36,925 --> 00:08:37,991
Hey.

198
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,417
Want to go back out to the scene?

199
00:08:41,663 --> 00:08:43,557
For the purpose of?

200
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,832
I want to take another look around.

201
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,922
If the concrete struck the car
as it passed under the bridge,

202
00:09:01,947 --> 00:09:03,071
would've continued on a ways

203
00:09:03,096 --> 00:09:05,244
before it hit the curb
and started rolling.

204
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:13,508
Think a piece might have
fallen and hit the windshield?

205
00:09:13,952 --> 00:09:15,578
Maybe.

206
00:09:15,739 --> 00:09:17,610
Or somebody threw it.

207
00:09:19,553 --> 00:09:22,129
I have a dimmer view
of humanity than you.

208
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,571
Son of a bitch.

209
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,295
Hey, Brett...

210
00:09:57,372 --> 00:09:59,730
- Oh, Cruz, don't!
- Oh!

211
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:01,421
Get out of the way!

212
00:10:01,455 --> 00:10:03,777
What? What the hell!

213
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,651
You see what I mean?

214
00:10:05,707 --> 00:10:07,230
Yeah, I do.

215
00:10:07,766 --> 00:10:09,566
What are you doing?

216
00:10:11,313 --> 00:10:12,513
I mean, look at it.

217
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:14,782
Compare this to the chunk that
came through the windshield.

218
00:10:14,816 --> 00:10:15,950
Do you guys even have that one?

219
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:17,393
Yes, we have that.

220
00:10:17,418 --> 00:10:20,087
But you can't pull prints
off a rough surface like this.

221
00:10:20,122 --> 00:10:21,589
This is beyond messed up.

222
00:10:21,623 --> 00:10:23,451
It's awful.

223
00:10:23,476 --> 00:10:24,825
Chief, Marcy said you're looking for me?

224
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,695
Lieutenant Kelly Severide,
lead firefighter on the scene.

225
00:10:27,737 --> 00:10:28,871
Lieutenant Rosin.

226
00:10:28,897 --> 00:10:30,327
Luke Rosin, Major Accidents.

227
00:10:30,352 --> 00:10:31,452
What's going on?

228
00:10:31,477 --> 00:10:34,040
That crash wasn't an accident.

229
00:10:34,136 --> 00:10:35,870
Somebody dropped a chunk of concrete

230
00:10:35,912 --> 00:10:37,546
onto the car from the overpass.

231
00:10:37,572 --> 00:10:39,040
On purpose? You kidding me?

232
00:10:39,074 --> 00:10:42,009
We're not sure about
anything yet, all right?

233
00:10:42,044 --> 00:10:43,878
Look at this.

234
00:10:43,912 --> 00:10:45,579
You can see he was practicing his shots,

235
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:46,947
trying to get his timing right.

236
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:48,682
He just waits for a car
to come by and then he...

237
00:10:48,717 --> 00:10:50,151
Look, I agree
it looks that way, all right,

238
00:10:50,185 --> 00:10:51,336
but we need more to go on.

239
00:10:51,369 --> 00:10:52,728
Did you guys talk to anyone on the scene

240
00:10:52,754 --> 00:10:54,055
who actually witnessed the accident?

241
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:54,989
No.

242
00:10:55,023 --> 00:10:56,657
Most the people came out of their houses

243
00:10:56,691 --> 00:10:57,892
when they heard the car crash.

244
00:10:57,926 --> 00:10:59,560
I know the driver's in an induced coma,

245
00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:00,971
but did she say anything on the scene?

246
00:11:00,996 --> 00:11:03,073
She was unconscious when we arrived.

247
00:11:03,198 --> 00:11:06,167
What about the, um... oh, gosh...
there was a little boy.

248
00:11:06,201 --> 00:11:07,675
Um.

249
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,737
Oh, gosh, Sean, or...

250
00:11:09,762 --> 00:11:11,644
You mean Zach?

251
00:11:11,749 --> 00:11:13,183
Right. Sorry.

252
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:16,143
Sean's a different incident.
I got three open cases right now.

253
00:11:16,178 --> 00:11:17,878
Did Zach... did he see anything?

254
00:11:17,913 --> 00:11:19,490
He was in the back reading a comic.

255
00:11:19,515 --> 00:11:22,050
He... he said he heard
a loud noise and...

256
00:11:22,184 --> 00:11:23,684
suddenly the car was rolling.

257
00:11:23,718 --> 00:11:24,793
Officer Rosin,

258
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:27,747
these other accidents
that you're investigating,

259
00:11:28,099 --> 00:11:30,700
are they really
more pressing than this one?

260
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,942
This just became my priority, all right?

261
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,398
And I'm gonna do my best
to catch this individual.

262
00:11:42,374 --> 00:11:44,241
Does it still qualify as a miracle baby

263
00:11:44,294 --> 00:11:46,263
if the whole thing
was caused by some sociopath

264
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,342
that's attacking
innocent people at random?

265
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:49,973
Of course it does.

266
00:11:50,934 --> 00:11:53,479
Heck, it's even more
of a miracle, considering.

267
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,782
Poor mother.

268
00:11:56,218 --> 00:11:59,860
<i>Ambulance 61. Sick person.
9570 Paulina Street.</i>

269
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:00,985
Paulina Street?

270
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,124
Sounds like Gerald forgot
to take his medication again.

271
00:12:03,158 --> 00:12:04,516
If that's all it is, fine.

272
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:07,228
I can't handle another
rough call right now.

273
00:12:08,463 --> 00:12:09,763
Knock knock.

274
00:12:09,798 --> 00:12:11,732
Tamara. Hey.

275
00:12:11,766 --> 00:12:14,189
You're not here to yell at me
about that school bus again, are you?

276
00:12:14,214 --> 00:12:16,796
- I thought it was delivered already.
- It was, last week.

277
00:12:16,838 --> 00:12:18,706
- Oh.
- Thank you very much.

278
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,692
No, I'm here about a gentleman
named Max Schlottman.

279
00:12:21,717 --> 00:12:22,817
You know him?

280
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:23,875
I sure do.

281
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,526
Well, he keeps coming by
the community center,

282
00:12:25,551 --> 00:12:28,942
asking me why you won't
respond to his calls.

283
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:32,153
Tamara, when you
badgered me into politics,

284
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:34,573
how come you didn't warn me
about people like Schlottman?

285
00:12:34,675 --> 00:12:36,290
What kind of people
are we talking about?

286
00:12:36,324 --> 00:12:37,391
You know.

287
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:39,464
The crazies.

288
00:12:39,785 --> 00:12:42,988
Matt, when you're an alderman,
here's the thing.

289
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:44,832
You don't get to pick your constituents.

290
00:12:44,866 --> 00:12:46,000
They pick you.

291
00:12:46,034 --> 00:12:48,169
Listen, I don't know what
the guy's issue is this week,

292
00:12:48,203 --> 00:12:49,904
but whatever it is,

293
00:12:49,938 --> 00:12:52,173
I'm sure there's nothing
I can do about it.

294
00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:54,775
Well, all I'm asking is
that you hear him out first

295
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:57,336
before you make that determination.

296
00:12:57,548 --> 00:12:58,648
Okay.

297
00:12:58,784 --> 00:13:00,625
I'll reach out.

298
00:13:01,216 --> 00:13:02,244
Thank you.

299
00:13:02,358 --> 00:13:04,092
Yeah.

300
00:13:06,714 --> 00:13:09,549
So, uh, these just need
your awesome signatures.

301
00:13:09,574 --> 00:13:10,978
You got it.

302
00:13:12,013 --> 00:13:13,160
- Oh.
- Yeah.

303
00:13:14,296 --> 00:13:17,098
We're really excited, you know.
Thank you for looping us in.

304
00:13:17,123 --> 00:13:19,867
Cool, cool, you guys are
making a super smart investment.

305
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:21,413
So are we locked into these drink deals

306
00:13:21,438 --> 00:13:23,170
where we have to
offer everyone half off?

307
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:25,206
That's how we draw a crowd.

308
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,609
But you'll get so many customers,

309
00:13:26,634 --> 00:13:28,842
you'll make it back in spades, trust me.

310
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:31,593
Uh-huh, and how many people
are signed up so far?

311
00:13:31,618 --> 00:13:33,092
Oh, don't worry about advanced sales.

312
00:13:33,117 --> 00:13:35,316
Everybody just signs up same day.

313
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:40,054
So all I need is
to collect that buy-in fee.

314
00:13:40,088 --> 00:13:41,792
Okay. 500 bucks, right?

315
00:13:41,817 --> 00:13:42,723
Yeah, you got it.

316
00:13:42,757 --> 00:13:45,359
Plus, everybody chips in
for marketing costs,

317
00:13:45,393 --> 00:13:47,387
which is an additional 2,200.

318
00:13:49,364 --> 00:13:51,182
What?

319
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,833
Well, that's pretty steep.

320
00:13:52,867 --> 00:13:54,802
Marketing is everything in bar crawls.

321
00:13:54,836 --> 00:13:56,370
I mean, you've seen the posters.

322
00:13:56,404 --> 00:13:57,471
We do it up right.

323
00:13:57,505 --> 00:13:59,610
- They are great posters.
- Yeah, plus we put ads

324
00:13:59,635 --> 00:14:01,909
on all the best
Chicago nightlife websites.

325
00:14:01,934 --> 00:14:03,674
That's good thinking.

326
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:05,079
- Herrmann.
- What?

327
00:14:05,113 --> 00:14:06,992
Hey, it's a great event.

328
00:14:07,017 --> 00:14:08,784
I think it's worth it.

329
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:10,877
Yeah.

330
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:13,474
It's an investment, like the man says.

331
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:15,226
I say we do it.

332
00:14:15,357 --> 00:14:17,249
You in?

333
00:14:17,843 --> 00:14:19,062
Come on, Otis.

334
00:14:19,087 --> 00:14:21,093
Come on.

335
00:14:21,396 --> 00:14:22,763
Fine.

336
00:14:22,797 --> 00:14:25,570
All right, trust me, this is going to be

337
00:14:25,595 --> 00:14:28,274
the biggest Drunken Mile yet.

338
00:14:29,966 --> 00:14:31,433
It's gonna be great.

339
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:32,993
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

340
00:14:33,018 --> 00:14:34,208
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

341
00:14:34,242 --> 00:14:37,311
- Oh, awesome, awesome.
- Yeah.

342
00:14:40,248 --> 00:14:42,116
It's funny, I... I feel okay now.

343
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,351
Well, we came all the way here,
so you're getting looked at.

344
00:14:44,386 --> 00:14:46,086
Gerald, what's the matter, hon?

345
00:14:46,121 --> 00:14:47,388
Hi, Doris.

346
00:14:47,422 --> 00:14:49,189
He was complaining of chest pains.

347
00:14:49,224 --> 00:14:51,458
We did a 12-lead.
Everything checked out okay.

348
00:14:51,503 --> 00:14:53,103
Still, he thought
better safe than sorry.

349
00:14:53,128 --> 00:14:54,467
Can never be too cautious.

350
00:14:54,492 --> 00:14:55,939
Let's get you in a room, Gerald.

351
00:14:57,098 --> 00:14:58,899
Hey, Dawson.

352
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:00,234
Catch a good run?

353
00:15:00,268 --> 00:15:01,802
Eh, not really.

354
00:15:01,827 --> 00:15:04,462
We had one of our frequent flyers
who was complaining of chest pains.

355
00:15:04,506 --> 00:15:07,608
Think he just wanted a free ride
to fill out his prescriptions.

356
00:15:07,642 --> 00:15:09,076
It's Like we're
Uber drivers or something.

357
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,451
Yeah.

358
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:11,465
What about you guys?

359
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,148
Nasty car wreck. Girl might lose a leg.

360
00:15:14,182 --> 00:15:15,316
But she could have died.

361
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,483
Good Samaritan

362
00:15:16,518 --> 00:15:18,607
stopped the bleeding till we got there.

363
00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:23,638
Hey! You!

364
00:15:26,752 --> 00:15:29,417
- Hey!
- Sir, wait!

365
00:15:30,213 --> 00:15:31,598
Whoa-whoa-whoa, what's wrong?

366
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:34,013
It's him. The guy who found the baby.

367
00:15:34,038 --> 00:15:35,639
What?

368
00:15:48,909 --> 00:15:51,087
It's the same guy
from this morning, no question.

369
00:15:51,112 --> 00:15:52,595
Tell me that's a coincidence.

370
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,633
He happens to witness
two terrible accidents

371
00:15:54,665 --> 00:15:56,750
in the same day? No chance.

372
00:15:56,845 --> 00:15:58,313
You didn't get his name?

373
00:15:58,383 --> 00:16:00,341
Well, I was busy
trying to save a patient.

374
00:16:00,374 --> 00:16:01,519
I don't understand.

375
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,654
He kept that girl alive
till we got there,

376
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,381
then he followed us here
to make sure she was okay.

377
00:16:06,406 --> 00:16:07,673
It doesn't seem like
the kind of guy who'd

378
00:16:07,707 --> 00:16:09,541
try to hurt someone on purpose.

379
00:16:09,575 --> 00:16:13,812
Mm, you know, sounds a lot
like "hero syndrome" to me.

380
00:16:13,846 --> 00:16:16,548
There are a lot of documented cases

381
00:16:16,582 --> 00:16:19,718
of individuals who create
these desperate situations

382
00:16:19,752 --> 00:16:21,820
so they can come along and fix them.

383
00:16:21,854 --> 00:16:24,356
You know, a nurse
who arrives just in time

384
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:28,293
or a night watchman
looking for his 15 minutes.

385
00:16:28,328 --> 00:16:29,661
So I'm just saying,
if it turns out to be

386
00:16:29,696 --> 00:16:31,496
your friend in the...
in the motorcycle jacket

387
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:33,507
who's causing all these accidents,

388
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:34,833
funnily enough from his perspective,

389
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:36,295
it's got very little to do with malice.

390
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,395
You know, he just wants
to save the day, be a big hero.

391
00:16:39,872 --> 00:16:41,873
That is really demented.

392
00:16:41,908 --> 00:16:43,008
Yeah.

393
00:16:43,042 --> 00:16:45,310
Not really the expression
that we shrinks like to use,

394
00:16:45,345 --> 00:16:47,442
but, um, I hear ya.

395
00:16:50,283 --> 00:16:51,717
Moto Stars.

396
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:52,793
What's that?

397
00:16:52,818 --> 00:16:55,053
It... it's a patch he had on his jacket.

398
00:16:55,088 --> 00:16:57,422
It said "Moto Stars," I'm pretty sure.

399
00:16:57,465 --> 00:16:59,432
I'll add that to his description.

400
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:02,288
"Moto Stars patch."

401
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:04,262
Okay, I'm gonna check
the security tapes,

402
00:17:04,297 --> 00:17:06,698
and, uh, let you guys know what I find.

403
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:08,500
Check the parking lot tapes too.

404
00:17:08,534 --> 00:17:09,701
If he parked his bike out back,

405
00:17:09,736 --> 00:17:11,603
maybe you can get the tags.

406
00:17:11,629 --> 00:17:12,910
Smart idea, Dawson.

407
00:17:12,935 --> 00:17:15,172
Thank you.

408
00:17:23,577 --> 00:17:25,314
Oh, my God.

409
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:27,129
What?

410
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,088
You okay?

411
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:31,456
That miracle baby.

412
00:17:31,491 --> 00:17:35,095
She didn't just miraculously
tumble into that sewer.

413
00:17:35,395 --> 00:17:37,485
He put her there.

414
00:17:38,097 --> 00:17:41,228
To make sure he was
the only one who could find her.

415
00:17:41,467 --> 00:17:42,836
He caused the wreck,

416
00:17:43,002 --> 00:17:45,303
saw that little girl
thrown from her car seat,

417
00:17:45,406 --> 00:17:48,101
and for all he knew,
she could have had spinal trauma

418
00:17:48,172 --> 00:17:50,578
or... or... or who knows what.

419
00:17:50,743 --> 00:17:52,577
But he just
picked her up and dropped her

420
00:17:52,612 --> 00:17:55,144
into some filthy storm sewer.

421
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:00,199
I swear to God, Brett,

422
00:18:00,449 --> 00:18:02,362
when they find this guy,

423
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:04,370
they're gonna have to
keep me away from him.

424
00:18:05,825 --> 00:18:07,092
You hear that?

425
00:18:07,126 --> 00:18:09,394
That's what I'm dealing with
all day long.

426
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:12,431
Non-stop construction
going on for months now.

427
00:18:12,617 --> 00:18:14,092
It's not right, Matthew.

428
00:18:14,117 --> 00:18:15,834
- It's making me crazy.
- Uh-huh.

429
00:18:15,868 --> 00:18:17,769
Trucks show up at the crack of dawn.

430
00:18:17,804 --> 00:18:19,438
Knuckleheads yelling at each other,

431
00:18:19,472 --> 00:18:20,505
banging things around.

432
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,734
This goes on all day long.

433
00:18:23,376 --> 00:18:24,951
Their trash blows into my yard.

434
00:18:24,976 --> 00:18:27,070
They set up a porta-toilet right outside

435
00:18:27,113 --> 00:18:29,320
of my bedroom window,
for crying out loud.

436
00:18:29,345 --> 00:18:31,413
Okay, okay.

437
00:18:34,153 --> 00:18:36,425
Marines, huh?

438
00:18:36,889 --> 00:18:38,490
Damn right.

439
00:18:38,524 --> 00:18:39,591
Gulf War.

440
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,427
7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade.

441
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:46,079
What about this menace outside, Matthew?

442
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,166
This isn't a way to live.

443
00:18:48,201 --> 00:18:49,868
What time do they
start up in the morning?

444
00:18:49,902 --> 00:18:52,671
8:00 A.M. every day.
Can you believe that?

445
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,866
Well, city noise ordinances

446
00:18:54,907 --> 00:18:57,609
say that's when
they're allowed to start.

447
00:18:57,643 --> 00:18:59,651
- They're allowed?
- I... I'm afraid so.

448
00:18:59,676 --> 00:19:01,978
It's construction, Mr. Schlottman.

449
00:19:02,073 --> 00:19:04,975
It's annoying, but it...
it's just a... a fact of life,

450
00:19:05,017 --> 00:19:06,551
for all of us.

451
00:19:06,586 --> 00:19:08,019
You gotta shut 'em down.

452
00:19:08,054 --> 00:19:09,554
Mr. Schlottman,

453
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:11,556
if they're following the law,

454
00:19:11,591 --> 00:19:13,825
how can I shut them down?

455
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,727
Well, there we have it.

456
00:19:15,761 --> 00:19:18,797
The little guy takes it
in the shorts once again.

457
00:19:18,831 --> 00:19:21,066
All right.

458
00:19:21,092 --> 00:19:22,398
Tell you what,

459
00:19:22,431 --> 00:19:25,126
how about I go over there
and try talking to them,

460
00:19:25,571 --> 00:19:27,639
see what I can do.

461
00:19:33,112 --> 00:19:36,006
Hey, excuse me! Looking for the foreman!

462
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:37,532
Thanks.

463
00:19:42,678 --> 00:19:44,372
Hey!

464
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,485
Hi. Hey.

465
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,323
My name's Matt Casey.
I'm the alderman of this ward.

466
00:19:51,898 --> 00:19:53,899
I'm here on behalf
of one of my constituents.

467
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:56,134
- Oh, that guy.
- Yeah.

468
00:19:56,441 --> 00:19:59,197
This ongoing construction
is distressing him.

469
00:19:59,222 --> 00:20:00,789
And if there's any way your men can be

470
00:20:00,814 --> 00:20:02,107
a little more considerate
about the noise...

471
00:20:02,141 --> 00:20:03,775
Let me stop you right there.

472
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:05,544
He's a head case, and I don't have time

473
00:20:05,578 --> 00:20:06,845
to talk to him or to you.

474
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:09,114
Hey, pal, I'm not
looking for an argument.

475
00:20:09,148 --> 00:20:10,682
Good, then get off my job site,

476
00:20:10,716 --> 00:20:12,668
I got work to do.

477
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,755
Great.

478
00:21:03,135 --> 00:21:05,761
I think we're good
on glasses there, buddy.

479
00:21:05,871 --> 00:21:06,805
Whoa.

480
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:09,174
Crawl started like
an hour ago, didn't it?

481
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,676
Listen, we're like fourth on the list.

482
00:21:11,711 --> 00:21:14,679
All right, they
just haven't made it in yet.

483
00:21:14,714 --> 00:21:16,217
Hope you're right.

484
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,752
Thanks. Half price today, right?

485
00:21:20,786 --> 00:21:23,608
You a Drunken Mile patron?

486
00:21:24,056 --> 00:21:26,944
No, I'm your friend.

487
00:21:27,226 --> 00:21:29,870
Not when I'm on this side of the bar.

488
00:21:29,895 --> 00:21:32,366
- Oh.
- Hey!

489
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:33,977
Oh.

490
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:36,795
Hey. Drunken Mile?

491
00:21:36,902 --> 00:21:38,036
Yeah.

492
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,038
Hey! Come on in.

493
00:21:40,162 --> 00:21:42,459
Come on in.

494
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:45,944
This is gonna be a disaster.

495
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,588
If I'd known it was gonna be like this,

496
00:21:52,065 --> 00:21:54,963
I would have signed up years ago.

497
00:21:55,054 --> 00:21:56,431
No kidding!

498
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,399
- Two more.
- Just a sec.

499
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:03,102
Hey, Otis! How incredible is this?

500
00:22:03,195 --> 00:22:04,362
It's incredible.

501
00:22:04,397 --> 00:22:07,414
We have already doubled our investment.

502
00:22:07,502 --> 00:22:09,801
Now, when you guys are
done congratulating yourselves,

503
00:22:09,835 --> 00:22:11,915
you mind giving me a hand
serving some drinks?

504
00:22:12,104 --> 00:22:14,095
Ah, yes.

505
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,872
So I'm gonna go drink at home.

506
00:22:20,913 --> 00:22:22,180
Hey, Mouch!

507
00:22:22,265 --> 00:22:24,015
Leave the glass here.

508
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:26,976
I'm the only one in the place
that paid full price!

509
00:22:31,413 --> 00:22:33,391
Well, Zach's got a couple fractured ribs

510
00:22:33,428 --> 00:22:35,760
and a nasty bump on the head,
it's non-concussive,

511
00:22:35,795 --> 00:22:37,896
and six stitches in his left forearm.

512
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,264
Mom still in the ICU?

513
00:22:39,298 --> 00:22:41,166
Yeah, but she's stable.

514
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,667
And the baby?

515
00:22:42,702 --> 00:22:44,007
We kept her around for observation,

516
00:22:44,032 --> 00:22:47,038
but nothing showed,
so Dad took her home.

517
00:22:53,713 --> 00:22:55,113
What's up, little man?

518
00:22:55,147 --> 00:22:57,282
Kelly, I got stitches!

519
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:00,752
Wow.

520
00:23:00,786 --> 00:23:03,755
What, probably only like
four or five, right?

521
00:23:03,781 --> 00:23:04,819
Six!

522
00:23:04,844 --> 00:23:07,292
Six? Wow. Are they giving you pudding?

523
00:23:07,326 --> 00:23:08,893
This place is supposed
to give you pudding

524
00:23:08,928 --> 00:23:10,361
when you have more than five stitches.

525
00:23:10,396 --> 00:23:12,063
Zach got his pudding and then some.

526
00:23:12,098 --> 00:23:13,216
Oh, good for you.

527
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:16,421
This place has the best pudding
in the whole world.

528
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:19,137
I should know, I got lots of stitches.

529
00:23:19,171 --> 00:23:21,360
Am I going to have a scar too?

530
00:23:21,385 --> 00:23:23,908
Well, I wouldn't worry
about it; scars are cool.

531
00:23:27,346 --> 00:23:29,814
You know, I'm not liking
the sound of that cough, bud.

532
00:23:34,754 --> 00:23:36,907
Does your chest hurt?

533
00:23:37,857 --> 00:23:40,158
Joanna, page Dr. Richards!

534
00:23:40,192 --> 00:23:41,759
Zach? Bud?

535
00:23:43,362 --> 00:23:45,323
Zach?

536
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,666
We need to intubate.

537
00:23:57,724 --> 00:23:59,590
Hey, buddy?

538
00:24:25,612 --> 00:24:27,424
You're still here.

539
00:24:28,949 --> 00:24:31,148
How is he?

540
00:24:31,318 --> 00:24:32,592
It was a hemothorax.

541
00:24:32,617 --> 00:24:36,320
We put in a chest tube
to drain his pleural cavity.

542
00:24:37,367 --> 00:24:39,802
Poor little guy was
drowning in his own blood.

543
00:24:39,993 --> 00:24:41,994
It's a good thing you caught it.

544
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:44,647
Yeah, well, he's not
out of the woods yet.

545
00:24:44,811 --> 00:24:45,940
Oh, thanks, Joanna.

546
00:24:45,966 --> 00:24:49,436
Can you just, like...
just give me another minute.

547
00:25:01,682 --> 00:25:02,815
Listen to this.

548
00:25:02,849 --> 00:25:05,885
The apartment complex going up
next to Mr. Schlottman,

549
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,287
they never got proper zoning approval.

550
00:25:08,322 --> 00:25:10,356
So how are they building it?

551
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:12,558
The developer just plowed ahead,

552
00:25:12,592 --> 00:25:14,560
figuring if they moved fast enough,

553
00:25:14,594 --> 00:25:16,963
stayed under the radar long enough,

554
00:25:16,997 --> 00:25:19,398
city wouldn't have a choice
but to rubber-stamp it.

555
00:25:19,433 --> 00:25:20,967
That works?

556
00:25:21,001 --> 00:25:22,321
Sometimes.

557
00:25:22,346 --> 00:25:24,935
- That's infuriating.
- Yeah, it is.

558
00:25:25,072 --> 00:25:27,669
But I'm not gonna
let them get away with it.

559
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:31,510
I'm gonna get this
whole project shut down.

560
00:25:34,091 --> 00:25:37,093
Really turns me on when
you get all fired up like that.

561
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:40,886
While you're at it,
can you get more cops

562
00:25:40,921 --> 00:25:42,922
assigned to accident investigation?

563
00:25:42,956 --> 00:25:44,588
They still haven't found
your rock-thrower?

564
00:25:44,613 --> 00:25:46,347
Nope.

565
00:25:46,372 --> 00:25:47,827
I bugged Antonio about it.

566
00:25:47,861 --> 00:25:50,563
He says Rosin's a good cop,
just overworked.

567
00:25:50,597 --> 00:25:53,499
But I did figure out was Moto Stars is.

568
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:55,501
This bike shop in Brighton Park.

569
00:25:55,535 --> 00:25:56,741
And Rosin's gonna go check it out,

570
00:25:56,766 --> 00:25:59,071
but first, he's combing
through a few hundred hours

571
00:25:59,106 --> 00:26:00,539
of traffic cam footage.

572
00:26:00,574 --> 00:26:02,942
He's trying to tie our guy
to other accidents.

573
00:26:02,976 --> 00:26:05,845
I'm sure he'll find the guy.

574
00:26:10,484 --> 00:26:12,852
I'll see you at the firehouse.
I'm gonna make a pit stop.

575
00:26:12,886 --> 00:26:14,687
Okay.

576
00:26:33,136 --> 00:26:34,261
Hey.

577
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,280
Hey.

578
00:26:37,657 --> 00:26:39,491
You didn't need to do that.

579
00:26:39,589 --> 00:26:41,757
You okay?

580
00:26:42,115 --> 00:26:44,179
Yeah, I'm fine.

581
00:26:46,478 --> 00:26:50,581
I have these friends back home.

582
00:26:50,757 --> 00:26:53,559
And whenever the job gets heavy,

583
00:26:53,593 --> 00:26:55,995
we, you know, we go out, we grab a drink

584
00:26:56,203 --> 00:26:58,803
and go dance, maybe.

585
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:01,100
But...

586
00:27:01,595 --> 00:27:04,327
we go out and we have fun.

587
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,444
I guess I just

588
00:27:06,631 --> 00:27:09,396
miss my people.

589
00:27:09,785 --> 00:27:12,552
Didn't think I would quite so much.

590
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:14,841
I get it.

591
00:27:16,207 --> 00:27:18,651
And I... I love this job.

592
00:27:18,685 --> 00:27:20,453
And I love Chicago

593
00:27:20,487 --> 00:27:23,062
and being with you, it's just...

594
00:27:23,737 --> 00:27:25,335
I wish I could help.

595
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:27,085
Kelly, you do.

596
00:27:27,242 --> 00:27:29,117
Come on.

597
00:27:29,275 --> 00:27:31,776
I just can't rely on you for everything.

598
00:27:42,392 --> 00:27:43,774
Hello?

599
00:27:43,927 --> 00:27:45,852
Hi.

600
00:27:46,062 --> 00:27:48,097
Can I help you find something?

601
00:27:48,196 --> 00:27:50,899
Uh, actually, yes, you can.

602
00:27:50,934 --> 00:27:52,901
Um, I know this is kind of a long shot,

603
00:27:52,936 --> 00:27:54,367
but I'm looking for a guy

604
00:27:54,392 --> 00:27:56,469
with one of these patches
on his riding jacket.

605
00:27:56,706 --> 00:27:58,507
Will any guy do?

606
00:27:58,541 --> 00:28:00,409
Or you looking for someone specific?

607
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,047
Uh, a very specific one.

608
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,920
You a cop?

609
00:28:11,955 --> 00:28:13,088
I'm a paramedic.

610
00:28:13,123 --> 00:28:14,857
You recognize this guy?

611
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:31,458
Rosin.

612
00:28:31,574 --> 00:28:33,310
His name's Scott.

613
00:28:34,811 --> 00:28:35,944
What am I looking at?

614
00:28:35,979 --> 00:28:37,880
It's an order form from that bike shop.

615
00:28:37,914 --> 00:28:39,448
Our guy is definitely a customer.

616
00:28:39,482 --> 00:28:42,371
He special-ordered a muffler.
That's his address.

617
00:28:42,585 --> 00:28:45,293
I told you I was gonna
hit the bike shop, right?

618
00:28:46,456 --> 00:28:48,657
You're busy. I'm just trying to help.

619
00:28:48,691 --> 00:28:50,657
And I got you this address, so...

620
00:28:50,794 --> 00:28:53,629
Okay, yes, thank you. I'll check it out.

621
00:28:53,663 --> 00:28:54,663
Great.

622
00:28:54,697 --> 00:28:56,704
I don't have to be at work
for another 20 minutes.

623
00:28:58,101 --> 00:29:01,103
Dawson, you're not coming with me.

624
00:29:06,609 --> 00:29:08,544
Okay. Let's go.

625
00:29:15,328 --> 00:29:17,398
You know, he ordered
this muffler six months ago.

626
00:29:17,954 --> 00:29:20,273
The address might not be current.

627
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,624
So you're giving up
'cause the guy's not answering?

628
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:23,824
No, I'm just pointing out,

629
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:25,618
it still might take a bit
to track him down.

630
00:29:25,662 --> 00:29:28,021
And we don't even have a last name yet.

631
00:29:31,968 --> 00:29:33,340
Excuse me, ma'am?

632
00:29:33,574 --> 00:29:35,057
Do you know a Scott who lives here?

633
00:29:35,082 --> 00:29:37,434
About my height, dirty blond?

634
00:29:38,975 --> 00:29:40,817
Thank you for your help.

635
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,004
People don't like talking to cops.

636
00:29:44,147 --> 00:29:46,793
But paramedics? They open up to us.

637
00:29:50,309 --> 00:29:53,231
Okay, let me do some digging.

638
00:29:53,379 --> 00:29:56,158
I'll park a uniform out here,
keep an eye on the place.

639
00:29:56,288 --> 00:29:57,826
We're gonna get this guy.

640
00:29:57,968 --> 00:29:59,895
Count on that.

641
00:30:00,038 --> 00:30:01,630
Let me know if you find anything, okay?

642
00:30:01,664 --> 00:30:03,532
That's easy.

643
00:30:03,655 --> 00:30:05,734
Every time I turn around,
you're right there.

644
00:30:31,794 --> 00:30:33,059
Hey.

645
00:30:33,196 --> 00:30:35,606
Why you eating lunch in here?

646
00:30:35,798 --> 00:30:37,853
Just wanted some
peace and quiet, I guess.

647
00:30:41,738 --> 00:30:45,774
Okay, so what's with the sour mood then?

648
00:30:45,915 --> 00:30:48,076
Molly's made a fortune last night.

649
00:30:48,183 --> 00:30:49,894
Now we can afford to do the repairs,

650
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,681
- we can get the new plumbing in...
- What about the mechanical bull?

651
00:30:52,715 --> 00:30:54,761
We gonna get one of those?

652
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,330
What?

653
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,021
Oh, it was, um,

654
00:30:59,214 --> 00:31:01,480
just a suggestion I made last year,

655
00:31:01,624 --> 00:31:03,925
but you shot me down,

656
00:31:04,052 --> 00:31:06,511
just like you shoot down all my ideas.

657
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,931
All right, what are
we talking about here?

658
00:31:08,965 --> 00:31:10,507
And disco night?

659
00:31:11,734 --> 00:31:13,068
Hermit crab racing?

660
00:31:13,102 --> 00:31:15,938
Um, free flu shot
with every tequila shot?

661
00:31:15,972 --> 00:31:18,540
Hey, those are all terrible ideas.

662
00:31:18,575 --> 00:31:20,922
Yeah, well, how would you know?
You never tried them, did you?

663
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:25,824
Herrmann, we've been partners
in this bar for five years.

664
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:26,816
Mm-hmm.

665
00:31:26,841 --> 00:31:28,323
Friends for a hell of a lot
longer than that,

666
00:31:28,348 --> 00:31:32,454
and you've never
given my suggestions a chance.

667
00:31:32,604 --> 00:31:34,548
And suddenly Kidd comes along,
she has an opinion,

668
00:31:34,634 --> 00:31:37,196
you're forking over
thousands of dollars.

669
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,174
Because it was a good idea.

670
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:41,649
You know what, forget I said anything.

671
00:31:45,602 --> 00:31:49,400
<i>Truck 81. Ambulance 61.
Car accident. Ogden and 53rd.</i>

672
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,091
What's the cross street again?

673
00:32:09,207 --> 00:32:10,887
Uh, 53rd street.

674
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,457
Should be just up ahead.

675
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,948
But...

676
00:32:16,232 --> 00:32:17,971
where's the accident?

677
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:22,450
Brett!

678
00:32:25,627 --> 00:32:27,160
Gabby!

679
00:32:27,485 --> 00:32:29,306
Did you see that?

680
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,251
Gabby! Are you all right?

681
00:32:39,234 --> 00:32:41,585
- Brett, you okay?
- Yeah.

682
00:32:50,872 --> 00:32:52,693
Come on!

683
00:32:53,591 --> 00:32:55,841
He's right up there! Stop him!

684
00:33:02,665 --> 00:33:05,284
I see him.
He's heading down the on ramp.

685
00:33:18,888 --> 00:33:20,189
I got him!

686
00:33:24,951 --> 00:33:26,618
Hey! Hey, get off me!

687
00:33:26,658 --> 00:33:28,710
There's been an accident!
I was just going to get help!

688
00:33:28,753 --> 00:33:30,887
Yeah, lucky for you, help has arrived.

689
00:33:30,921 --> 00:33:33,887
- Otis, call for backup.
- Copy that.

690
00:33:34,158 --> 00:33:35,859
Easy, Gabby.

691
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,652
It's over.

692
00:33:37,796 --> 00:33:39,504
You're going down.

693
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:41,747
- Get up.
- Come on.

694
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,392
Oh, hey, so there's this radiology tech

695
00:33:51,417 --> 00:33:52,947
that I met at Med the other night.

696
00:33:52,972 --> 00:33:54,644
Very cute girl.

697
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:56,885
Think Anna might do some recon for me?

698
00:33:57,014 --> 00:33:58,815
Ask her next time you see her.

699
00:33:58,849 --> 00:34:00,674
All right, fine.

700
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,486
How's she, uh, liking Chicago?

701
00:34:03,528 --> 00:34:05,573
She misses home.

702
00:34:06,657 --> 00:34:09,059
Can't blame her if
she decides to go back.

703
00:34:11,195 --> 00:34:12,762
Well, you gotta show her around.

704
00:34:12,797 --> 00:34:15,545
Chicago's the greatest
city in the world, come on.

705
00:34:19,303 --> 00:34:20,670
Mr. Schlottman.

706
00:34:20,778 --> 00:34:22,661
Matthew, come in.

707
00:34:23,874 --> 00:34:26,559
How goes the battle?
You shut 'em down yet?

708
00:34:26,711 --> 00:34:29,162
I wish I had better news for you.

709
00:34:29,347 --> 00:34:31,981
I can't get the construction
halted just yet.

710
00:34:32,186 --> 00:34:34,517
But... but they're
in violation, you said...

711
00:34:34,552 --> 00:34:36,911
Yeah, I know, and I filed a complaint.

712
00:34:36,936 --> 00:34:39,789
But there's an appeals process
that has to play out.

713
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:41,825
And in the meantime,
they get to keep building.

714
00:34:41,891 --> 00:34:42,959
Oh.

715
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:46,096
The problem is this
developer's very well connected,

716
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,140
so I have to find allies in the council,

717
00:34:48,165 --> 00:34:49,699
and that's gonna take time.

718
00:34:49,734 --> 00:34:51,396
And they might even finish the project

719
00:34:51,421 --> 00:34:53,741
before I can get any traction.

720
00:34:54,211 --> 00:34:55,781
But I'm gonna fight this
to the bitter end.

721
00:34:55,806 --> 00:34:57,694
I promise you that.

722
00:34:57,842 --> 00:35:00,202
I'm very sorry, Mr. Schlottman.

723
00:35:01,509 --> 00:35:05,115
Matthew, what are you
beating yourself up for, huh?

724
00:35:05,322 --> 00:35:08,822
No-no-no, I... I've let you down.
You came to me for help and...

725
00:35:09,765 --> 00:35:11,710
politics happened.

726
00:35:13,476 --> 00:35:15,101
I guess

727
00:35:15,226 --> 00:35:17,158
if I move my bed

728
00:35:17,328 --> 00:35:20,867
down here into the dining room,
away from that porta-toilet,

729
00:35:20,892 --> 00:35:22,830
I'll be okay.

730
00:35:26,103 --> 00:35:28,063
Wait, hang on.

731
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:30,789
That's the real issue here?

732
00:35:31,289 --> 00:35:33,742
Just... the toilet?

733
00:35:33,844 --> 00:35:36,556
It's right outside
of my window, Matthew.

734
00:35:36,781 --> 00:35:38,400
It's no way to live.

735
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:47,014
Alderman.

736
00:35:47,156 --> 00:35:48,834
You need to use the facilities?

737
00:35:48,922 --> 00:35:51,078
What'll take to move the porta-potty?

738
00:35:51,195 --> 00:35:52,262
I'm sorry, what?

739
00:35:52,296 --> 00:35:55,680
What'll it take to move it away
from Mr. Schlottman's house?

740
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,401
60, 80 bucks?

741
00:36:00,282 --> 00:36:02,040
A hundred ought to do it.

742
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,885
- Hey, Carlos!
- Yeah?

743
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:10,049
Grab a couple guys and move
this john around back,

744
00:36:10,074 --> 00:36:11,824
- would you?
- You got it, boss.

745
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:26,346
Hey.

746
00:36:26,764 --> 00:36:28,387
Hey!

747
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,253
It's your first time here, right?

748
00:36:30,278 --> 00:36:32,794
Yeah, but, I mean,
I've heard a lot about it.

749
00:36:32,845 --> 00:36:35,105
I figured she should get to know
the best bar in Chicago.

750
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,207
Ah, damn straight, okay.
What do you want?

751
00:36:37,241 --> 00:36:40,276
Uh, okay, let me see,
I guess I'll have, um...

752
00:36:40,311 --> 00:36:41,377
Oh, hey. Here he is.

753
00:36:41,412 --> 00:36:42,352
- Oh.
- Get ready.

754
00:36:42,386 --> 00:36:44,223
- Okay.
- Hey, Otis, hey!

755
00:36:44,248 --> 00:36:45,249
Uh...

756
00:36:45,274 --> 00:36:47,417
sorry, service is usually
a little better.

757
00:36:47,451 --> 00:36:48,559
Hi.

758
00:36:48,584 --> 00:36:50,320
Hey, hit it, Kidd!

759
00:36:50,354 --> 00:36:51,321
Pow!

760
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:55,925
Welcome to Disco Night
at Molly's, right?

761
00:36:59,096 --> 00:37:02,165
So you go whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, right?

762
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:04,901
So, listen, I figure, uh,

763
00:37:04,945 --> 00:37:07,570
first Monday every month,
we get this baby spinning

764
00:37:07,595 --> 00:37:10,073
and then we turn
a little Donna Summer music on

765
00:37:10,107 --> 00:37:12,790
and we start serving
Pink Ladies, what do you say?

766
00:37:13,143 --> 00:37:14,673
You...

767
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:16,595
Yeah.

768
00:37:17,181 --> 00:37:19,866
- Really?
- For you, absolutely.

769
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:22,352
- Hey, hey!
- Yeah?

770
00:37:22,386 --> 00:37:23,953
Will you turn the sparkles off?

771
00:37:24,397 --> 00:37:26,444
- Hey.
- Oh, wow.

772
00:37:29,592 --> 00:37:31,780
Let's get out of here.

773
00:37:34,298 --> 00:37:37,630
You know, ice skating
really isn't my thing, you know?

774
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:38,868
I know you said that like four times.

775
00:37:38,903 --> 00:37:40,911
Three... times.

776
00:37:41,005 --> 00:37:42,755
Said it three times.

777
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,274
All right, well, come on, man up.

778
00:37:44,308 --> 00:37:45,308
This'll be fun.

779
00:37:45,342 --> 00:37:47,472
Okay, but you... you've
done this before, right?

780
00:37:47,497 --> 00:37:49,212
Like you're... you're stable...

781
00:37:49,246 --> 00:37:51,180
Yeah, I... I played hockey
when I was a kid.

782
00:37:51,215 --> 00:37:53,099
Okay.

783
00:37:58,322 --> 00:38:01,291
I don't know, you're looking
a little shaky there, pal.

784
00:38:01,325 --> 00:38:03,397
Hey, it's been a few years.

785
00:38:03,561 --> 00:38:04,936
I'll get it back.

786
00:38:04,995 --> 00:38:06,529
I've already dodged death once.

787
00:38:06,564 --> 00:38:08,500
Come on, give me your arm, woman.

788
00:38:08,766 --> 00:38:10,601
Hold on.

789
00:38:12,746 --> 00:38:14,039
Okay.

790
00:38:14,218 --> 00:38:15,405
Okay.

791
00:38:15,578 --> 00:38:17,206
This is not so bad.

792
00:38:17,241 --> 00:38:18,765
Impressed, aren't you?

793
00:38:18,841 --> 00:38:21,147
Yes. Very much so.

794
00:38:23,811 --> 00:38:25,448
There you go.

795
00:38:29,658 --> 00:38:31,111
Now check this out.

796
00:38:33,392 --> 00:38:34,853
Wow.

797
00:38:35,587 --> 00:38:37,611
That's your city now.

798
00:38:39,029 --> 00:38:40,624
It's pretty great, huh?

799
00:38:42,256 --> 00:38:44,280
It's really great.

800
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,291
I'm glad to hear that.

801
00:38:53,459 --> 00:38:55,579
Thanks for letting me know.

802
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,514
Bye. Uh, that was Maggie at Med.

803
00:38:58,549 --> 00:39:00,450
Zach's getting released
from the hospital today.

804
00:39:00,484 --> 00:39:01,951
His mom's improving too.

805
00:39:01,986 --> 00:39:04,087
And Dad brought Baby Layla in
to see her today.

806
00:39:04,121 --> 00:39:06,759
She got to hold her for the
first time since the accident.

807
00:39:07,266 --> 00:39:09,577
So you saved a family
and caught a psychopath.

808
00:39:09,602 --> 00:39:11,594
All in a day's work, huh?

809
00:39:11,629 --> 00:39:14,130
What about you?
Don't sell yourself short.

810
00:39:14,164 --> 00:39:16,171
It's true. It's true.

811
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,826
I got the porta-john moved

812
00:39:17,851 --> 00:39:21,312
15 feet away from
Mr. Schlottman's window, so.

813
00:39:21,505 --> 00:39:23,473
Nice work, Alderman.

814
00:39:23,507 --> 00:39:26,442
Yeah, not really.
I paid off a construction foreman.

815
00:39:26,477 --> 00:39:28,978
You listened to a man's problems
and you went to bat for him.

816
00:39:29,013 --> 00:39:30,813
- That's all that matters.
- Mm.

817
00:39:30,848 --> 00:39:32,982
Moving a toilet, saving a family,

818
00:39:33,017 --> 00:39:34,317
basically the same thing.

819
00:39:34,351 --> 00:39:36,252
Exactly.

820
00:39:42,493 --> 00:39:44,841
Are we ever gonna be a family?

821
00:39:47,507 --> 00:39:50,920
I... I just keep thinking
about it since Louie left.

822
00:39:59,401 --> 00:40:01,346
We are a family.

823
00:40:09,009 --> 00:40:14,009

1
00:00:00,398 --> 00:00:01,851
We gotta protect Leon.

2
00:00:01,887 --> 00:00:03,733
Cruz, he's gotta
get out of town.

3
00:00:03,769 --> 00:00:06,205
- How long?
- For a long time.

4
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:08,371
Maybe forever.

5
00:00:08,407 --> 00:00:10,106
You're really lucky,
you know that?

6
00:00:10,142 --> 00:00:13,575
You're such a close-knit group.
It's like family.

7
00:00:13,611 --> 00:00:15,978
Your friend Hope has been
visiting the firehouse a lot.

8
00:00:16,014 --> 00:00:18,748
I think she might be dealing
with something back at home.

9
00:00:18,784 --> 00:00:19,978
Don't forget you
made a promise

10
00:00:20,014 --> 00:00:21,785
we'd hang out before I left.

11
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:24,023
That's not the kind of thing
that slips my mind.

12
00:00:50,115 --> 00:00:54,017
Yo, Kelly!

13
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:56,857
Train is leaving the station.

14
00:01:00,258 --> 00:01:02,426
Hey.

15
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:05,732
Hi, hey.

16
00:01:07,432 --> 00:01:09,098
Do you guys,
um, want some coffee?

17
00:01:09,134 --> 00:01:11,401
- I could run out to...
- Oh, we get coffee at work.

18
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:14,437
Oh, right, sure.

19
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:19,408
I'm just gonna get myself
to the house this morning.

20
00:01:19,444 --> 00:01:21,044
Okay, cool.
Sounds good.

21
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,914
Uh, I'll see you up there.
And, uh...

22
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,484
- Hope, right?
- Yeah.

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,890
Great seeing you.

24
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,926
Whose buggy is that?

25
00:01:36,962 --> 00:01:39,029
Ah, Boden's out first
half of shift.

26
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:42,932
- We got some chief named Mullins.
- You know him?

27
00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:45,038
I heard he was a bear.

28
00:01:47,473 --> 00:01:49,309
Is that everyone?

29
00:01:52,244 --> 00:01:54,744
As I always tell
the men serving under me...

30
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,913
Hey, uh,
sorry, Chief.

31
00:01:57,949 --> 00:02:00,050
As I was saying,
on my watch,

32
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:02,785
if you're not 15 minutes early,
you're 15 minutes late.

33
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:04,988
The shift before you
appreciates your punctuality,

34
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:07,823
as I'm sure you do
the shift that follows.

35
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:10,060
That said, I'm only at 51
for half a shift,

36
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:12,763
and I've got nothing but respect
for Wallace Boden.

37
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,396
So let's all power through
the next few hours

38
00:02:14,432 --> 00:02:15,999
and get you back
in his capable hands.

39
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,366
- Sound good.?
- Yes, sir.

40
00:02:17,402 --> 00:02:19,502
Okay, good.
Assignments.

41
00:02:19,538 --> 00:02:21,905
Let's empty out all
the compartments on the rigs.

42
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,806
We'll clean, check, and do
maintenance on the equipment

43
00:02:23,842 --> 00:02:25,407
and you can scrub and wax
the inside shelving.

44
00:02:25,443 --> 00:02:29,014
Once that's complete...

45
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:31,514
- Is there a problem?
- No, Chief.

46
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,984
It's just, Tuesdays we usually
only do the side compartments.

47
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,056
And like you said,
it's only half a shift.

48
00:02:38,557 --> 00:02:41,458
- What's your name, Lieutenant?
- Matt Casey, Chief.

49
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:46,432
- The firefighting alderman.
- Former alderman.

50
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,299
Once that's complete,
let's get the app floor

51
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:52,936
swept and mopped...
if you don't mind.

52
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:55,405
Consider it done,
Chief.

53
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,274
Dismissed.

54
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:05,948
- Sorry, guys.
- It's fine.

55
00:03:05,984 --> 00:03:07,216
Half a shift.

56
00:03:07,252 --> 00:03:09,151
What's the worst
that could happen?

57
00:03:09,187 --> 00:03:11,520
Question asked by nearly
every Darwin Award winner.

58
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,057
Uh, hey, guys.
I texted my buddy

59
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:17,394
who served under Mullins
over at 78.

60
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,929
Yeah?
What'd he say?

61
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,496
"That man has killed
more careers

62
00:03:20,532 --> 00:03:23,132
in the CFD than actual fire."

63
00:03:23,168 --> 00:03:25,969
Well, let's knuckle down
and not give him

64
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:28,305
any reason to look our way.

65
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:31,374
You got it, Lieutenant.

66
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,610
<i>Ambulance 61,
4200 North Walcott Avenue.</i>

67
00:03:34,646 --> 00:03:35,612
<i>Bicycle accident.</i>

68
00:03:48,627 --> 00:03:51,964
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

69
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,430
It's like she came out
of nowhere.

70
00:03:54,466 --> 00:03:55,931
I didn't see her.

71
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:57,566
I looked down for one second.

72
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:03,072
Hi, honey.
What's your name?

73
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:05,574
- Ella.
- Ella?

74
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,276
I'm Sylvie.
This is Gabby.

75
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:09,946
We're here to help.
Can you tell me what hurts?

76
00:04:09,982 --> 00:04:12,181
- Just my wrist.
- Is she gonna be okay?

77
00:04:12,217 --> 00:04:13,650
Ella, can you lie down for us?

78
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,484
We're gonna slide
this under you.

79
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,554
- She said it's her wrist.
- Sir, you need to let us work.

80
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,590
Here you go.

81
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,499
- Is he okay?
- Don't worry about him.

82
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:31,967
Can you squeeze my hand?

83
00:04:32,003 --> 00:04:33,936
I think there's something
wrong with him.

84
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,576
You gotta be kidding me.

85
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,482
No pulse.
This is 61

86
00:04:46,518 --> 00:04:49,386
requesting a backup ambulance
for a possible cardiac arrest.

87
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,554
<i>Copy that, 61.</i>

88
00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:00,996
He's in V-tach.
We need to shock him.

89
00:05:01,032 --> 00:05:03,169
Is he okay?

90
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,037
What happened?

91
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,071
All right,
let's concentrate on you, okay?

92
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:10,607
I'm okay.
What happened?

93
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,943
Okay, Ella, listen to me.
The best way that you

94
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,343
can help him
is to stay calm.

95
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:16,345
That way Gabby can concentrate,
okay?

96
00:05:16,381 --> 00:05:18,681
Shocking.

97
00:05:18,717 --> 00:05:20,015
He's back.

98
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,253
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey.

99
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:25,020
I gotta get out of here.
I gotta get somewhere.

100
00:05:25,056 --> 00:05:26,289
Sir, you lost consciousness.

101
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:27,991
We need to get you
to a hospital.

102
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:29,559
Dispatch, where's
that second ambo?

103
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,427
- I had a heart attack?
- Just lie back down for me,

104
00:05:31,463 --> 00:05:32,462
okay?

105
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,963
Hey, eyes on me, okay?

106
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:35,567
- Where are your parents?
- Work.

107
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:37,734
I know my mom's number.

108
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,301
<i>Had a mix up, 61.
Ten minutes.</i>

109
00:05:39,337 --> 00:05:41,705
<i>I'll start you in a company.</i>

110
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,706
What's wrong?

111
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,643
Okay, Ella,
we're gonna take you both

112
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:49,612
in the same ambulance, okay?
We're gonna call your mom

113
00:05:49,648 --> 00:05:51,280
- on the way.
- Okay.

114
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:52,114
Okay.

115
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,051
We gotta take them to Med,
and we can't leave her alone.

116
00:05:56,087 --> 00:05:57,052
It's our only choice.

117
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,189
Dispatch, we're gonna
transport two patients

118
00:06:00,225 --> 00:06:02,725
to Chicago Med.
One, two, three.

What are you whistling
sunshine about up there?

121
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:25,080
Ah, nothing.
Toss me that rag.

122
00:06:25,116 --> 00:06:27,049
All right, spill it.

123
00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:30,220
What, I can't find
cleaning therapeutic?

124
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,655
No.

125
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:35,095
All right.

126
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,696
I flew Leon in
for Cruz's birthday.

127
00:06:40,732 --> 00:06:43,366
- What?
- Who is Leon?

128
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:46,602
- Cruz's kid brother.
- Cruz's kid brother who lives

129
00:06:46,638 --> 00:06:48,772
in Florida now because it's
not safe for him to be here.

130
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,239
That's all blown over.

131
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:52,141
Trudy checked with
the gang unit.

132

The street corners have
changed over three times.

133
00:06:54,145 --> 00:06:56,078
Nobody even knows
who Leon is anymore.

134
00:06:56,114 --> 00:06:58,117
You sure about that?

135
00:06:59,717 --> 00:07:02,085
Do you doubt my wife?

136
00:07:06,825 --> 00:07:09,191
That's what I thought.

137
00:07:09,227 --> 00:07:11,593
- Cruz would love to see him.
- All we gotta do

138
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:14,696
is get the birthday boy
to Molly's after shift,

139
00:07:14,732 --> 00:07:17,801
and in the meantime,
shh.

140
00:07:20,138 --> 00:07:23,739
This is gonna be great.

141
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,782
- So.
- So.

142
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:34,516
- Brett's friend?
- Yep.

143
00:07:34,552 --> 00:07:36,518
- Mmm.
- What?

144
00:07:36,554 --> 00:07:38,554
She's only here for, like,
another week.

145
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,789
Uh, tomorrow, actually.

146
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:41,424
- Wow.
- All the information

147
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,063
- was on the table.
- Pfft.

148
00:07:46,297 --> 00:07:48,664
- Hey, how was it?
- It was a weird one.

149
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,799
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

150
00:07:49,835 --> 00:07:51,835
- We had this, um...
- 61.

151
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,337
Yes, Chief.
Brett and Dawson, sir.

152
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,239
Oh, I know your names.
You've just been reported to me.

153
00:07:57,275 --> 00:07:59,275
- Reported?
- You took two patients at once.

154
00:07:59,311 --> 00:08:00,609
Chief, it was an
extraordinary situation.

155
00:08:00,645 --> 00:08:02,345
Which is not to be done.

156
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,513
Under any circumstances
without expressed consent

157
00:08:04,549 --> 00:08:06,583
from Chief Hatcher in
a triage event situation.

158
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,451
The second ambo was
nowhere to be found,

159
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:10,253
and we had a crucial
cardiac patient.

160
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:12,222
You put an injured girl
in an ambulance

161
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,124
with the man who
hit her with his car.

162
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,525
That's a lawsuit
waiting to happen.

163
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,326
Sounds like they made
a judgment call

164
00:08:17,362 --> 00:08:19,496
in a challenging circumstance,
Chief.

165
00:08:23,768 --> 00:08:25,234
I'm taking you out of service.

166
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,369
- What?
- So you can fill out

167
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,338
a detailed incident report.

168
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:29,772
If you wanna defend
your actions,

169
00:08:29,808 --> 00:08:31,573
and if you want me as
acting battalion chief

170
00:08:31,609 --> 00:08:33,376
to defend your actions,
you need to do it

171
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:34,776
with every "I" dotted
and every "T" crossed.

172
00:08:34,812 --> 00:08:36,346
You can return to service

173
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:37,914
when I'm satisfied
with that paperwork,

174
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,717
which I want on my desk
before I leave.

175
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,584
Chief,
all due respect...

176
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,524
Due respect would be
letting me handle this.

177
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,358
Unless there's something
other than Lieutenant

178
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:50,492
in front of your name.

179
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:13,240
Wow.

180
00:09:13,276 --> 00:09:15,093
Mullins just asked us
to wash the rigs.

181
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:17,061
He didn't ask us
to itemize the work.

182
00:09:17,097 --> 00:09:18,907
Maybe I should talk to him.

183
00:09:18,943 --> 00:09:19,870
Smooth things over.

184
00:09:19,906 --> 00:09:22,526
Or just keep your head down
and stay out of his way.

185
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,831
Works every time.

186
00:09:25,813 --> 00:09:30,282
Sure.
Every time.

187
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,527
- How's it going?
- I already missed two calls

188
00:09:41,563 --> 00:09:43,763
because of this busywork.

189
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:46,398
Aww, we're almost done.

190
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:48,033
I really stepped in it
with this guy.

191
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:51,037
- Oh, don't beat yourself up.
- Yeah, seemed unavoidable.

192
00:09:51,073 --> 00:09:52,886
Well, I still
feel responsible.

193
00:09:52,922 --> 00:09:56,041
Nonsense.

194
00:09:56,077 --> 00:09:58,543
Is that how you're
gonna turn it in?

195
00:09:58,579 --> 00:09:59,943
A little hard to read.

196
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:01,583
Like, I think you
rushed through it.

197
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:04,916
I just think, with a stickler
like Chief Mullins,

198
00:10:04,952 --> 00:10:07,487
you probably want to put
your best foot forward and...

199
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:11,594
You know what?
I'm just gonna...

200
00:10:16,357 --> 00:10:18,722
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Paul Pogue!

201
00:10:18,758 --> 00:10:20,591
- What's up, man?
- Can't complain.

202
00:10:20,627 --> 00:10:22,260
We borrowed your strong arm
for that South Loop call.

203
00:10:22,296 --> 00:10:23,327
Where do you want it?

204
00:10:23,363 --> 00:10:25,330
Right there is fine.

205
00:10:25,366 --> 00:10:27,398
Hey, Cruz.
I gotta tell you, man.

206
00:10:27,434 --> 00:10:28,665
Leon looks great.
I didn't know

207
00:10:28,701 --> 00:10:29,736
he was back in Chicago.

208
00:10:30,903 --> 00:10:32,370
He's not.

209
00:10:32,406 --> 00:10:33,804
Really?
I could've sworn I saw him

210
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,606
at Wiener Circle this morning
with a lady cop.

211
00:10:35,642 --> 00:10:37,741
Hey, that must have been
somebody else.

212
00:10:37,777 --> 00:10:40,245
You sure?

213
00:10:40,281 --> 00:10:42,447
I think I would know
if my brother were in town

214
00:10:42,483 --> 00:10:43,880
for the first time
in three years.

215
00:10:46,853 --> 00:10:49,486
Must've been
his long lost twin, I guess.

216
00:10:49,522 --> 00:10:52,392
- See you, guys.
- Later.

217
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,732
Hey, Leon.

218
00:11:01,768 --> 00:11:04,902
Give me a call
when you get this.

219
00:11:04,938 --> 00:11:08,005
You're blown, man.
It's time to come clean.

220
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,574
We can still save this.
Number one,

221
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,910
I will contact Leon and tell him
to throw Cruz off the scent.

222
00:11:13,946 --> 00:11:14,912
- That's good.
- Good?

223
00:11:14,948 --> 00:11:16,346
It's a disaster.

224
00:11:16,382 --> 00:11:19,384
Yeah, what's number two?

225
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,053
I haven't gotten that far yet.

226
00:11:26,826 --> 00:11:28,393
Yeah?

227
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:29,861
I just got
an interesting phone call.

228
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,795
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

229
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,032
- You remember Captain Patterson?
- Of course.

230
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,366
He's been spending a lot
of time down at headquarters.

231
00:11:36,402 --> 00:11:38,936
And he says that Mullins
is on the short list

232
00:11:38,972 --> 00:11:41,673
to be the next Commissioner.

233
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:42,973
This is a joke.

234
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:45,543
Happening next summer.
According to Patterson.

235
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,944
- Oy.
- Yeah.

236
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,717
So, remember what I said
about not saying something?

237
00:11:53,052 --> 00:11:54,721
Maybe you should say something.

238
00:11:56,556 --> 00:12:00,524
You wanna check my penmanship?
Be my guest.

239
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,697
Fix this so I can get back
to doing my job.

240
00:12:15,408 --> 00:12:18,476
- How's it going?
- Got me reorganizing

241
00:12:18,512 --> 00:12:22,349
the red files.
Short staffed already.

242
00:12:23,751 --> 00:12:26,016
He available?

243
00:12:26,052 --> 00:12:27,721
Be my guest.

244
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,563
- Chief.
- Lieutenant.

245
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:41,032
Paramedics finished
the IR-3s and the IR-7s.

246
00:12:41,068 --> 00:12:42,904
Double-checked them myself.

247
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:50,741
Listen, uh...

248
00:12:50,777 --> 00:12:54,412
I just want to apologize
for stepping on your toes.

249
00:12:54,448 --> 00:12:56,417
It won't happen again.

250
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,549
I got off on
the wrong foot with you,

251
00:12:59,585 --> 00:13:01,385
and that's on me.

252
00:13:01,421 --> 00:13:03,891
So, I'm sorry.
Sincerely.

253
00:13:09,028 --> 00:13:12,096
I want you to know,
these are good people at 51.

254
00:13:12,132 --> 00:13:13,597
To a man.

255
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:15,500
And they all take
the job seriously.

256
00:13:15,536 --> 00:13:18,638
They're all smoke eaters.
Even our paramedics.

257
00:13:21,441 --> 00:13:22,807
You know what
I saw this morning

258
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,546
when I parked on your apron,
Lieutenant?

259
00:13:27,513 --> 00:13:30,782
Two cigar butts,
half chewed,

260
00:13:30,818 --> 00:13:33,150
just lying on the pavement
outside the northeast door,

261
00:13:33,186 --> 00:13:35,753
tossed there without
a care in the world.

262
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:38,655
And I said to myself,
what kind of pride

263
00:13:38,691 --> 00:13:40,792
does this house have?

264
00:13:40,828 --> 00:13:43,059
Who would disrespect
their home like that?

265
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:49,100
Well, I guess I found out.

266
00:13:51,537 --> 00:13:54,505
That's your response
to my apology?

267
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:59,610
<i>Truck 81, Ambulance 61,
515 North Monroe Street,</i>

268
00:13:59,646 --> 00:14:01,144
<i>possible jumper.</i>

269
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,181
- When is Boden back?
- In a couple of hours.

270
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,150
Hallelujah.

271
00:14:24,271 --> 00:14:25,937
Negotiator's up
there with him,

272
00:14:25,973 --> 00:14:26,938
but it's gotten quiet.

273
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:31,107
Herrmann, grab a rope bag
and come to the roof with me.

274
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:33,543
Kidd, pike poles,
then you, Mouch, and Otis

275
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:36,646
get access to the
top floor apartments.

276
00:14:36,682 --> 00:14:39,183
- Let's go.
- What you thinking, Lieutenant?

277
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:41,986
Saving Joe Citizen,
whether he wants it or not.

278
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,535
This is the best idea
I've had in a long time.

279
00:14:58,571 --> 00:15:02,773
No, Dan.
Trust me, it's not.

280
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:05,242
I like you alive.
Why don't you come back

281
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:07,944
from the edge, there?
It'd make me feel a lot better,

282
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,081
and then we could have
a face-to face conversation.

283
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,749
- No.
- Okay.

284
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:15,152
Just one foot back.
Can you do that for me?

285
00:15:15,188 --> 00:15:19,289
Just the length of your foot,
just back a little bit?

286
00:15:19,325 --> 00:15:21,925
- Who's he?
- Hi, I'm Matt.

287
00:15:21,961 --> 00:15:23,628
- I'm a firefighter.
- Get back.

288
00:15:23,664 --> 00:15:24,895
Don't come any closer.

289
00:15:24,931 --> 00:15:26,931
I'll talk to him, Dan.
Don't worry.

290
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,835
Matt and I are gonna talk
right over here, okay?

291
00:15:30,871 --> 00:15:34,739
I got a bad feeling.
He is way too calm.

292
00:15:34,775 --> 00:15:38,643
- He said he's made up his mind.
- He been repeating it?

293
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:40,010
- Twice.
- Damn.

294
00:15:40,046 --> 00:15:43,313
Yeah.
You wanna try snatch and pull?

295
00:15:43,349 --> 00:15:45,048
He'd jump before I got to him.

296
00:15:48,055 --> 00:15:49,953
What's your comfort level
with something risky?

297
00:15:49,989 --> 00:15:52,289
This guy's going.
Whatever you wanna try,

298
00:15:52,325 --> 00:15:53,758
I'm good with that.

299
00:15:53,794 --> 00:15:55,326
I know you're
talking about me.

300
00:15:55,362 --> 00:15:57,061
I know what you're saying.
Same as everyone.

301
00:15:57,097 --> 00:15:59,330
- Look at the loser.
- Just keep his focus.

302
00:16:01,767 --> 00:16:04,302
Come on now, Dan.
Nobody's talking about you.

303
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:08,806
We're not talking about you.
We are not talking about you.

304
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,074
- Yes you are, just like Rachel.
- Who's Rachel, Dan?

305
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,275
Nobody.

306
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:13,944
Hey, hey, hey,
look at me.

307
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,646
Focus on me, Dan.
Is Rachel your girlfriend?

308
00:16:16,682 --> 00:16:17,981
- Your wife?
- Sister.

309
00:16:18,017 --> 00:16:20,851
Okay, okay, see?
See, there you go.

310
00:16:20,887 --> 00:16:23,220
I guarantee you Rachel
would want you

311
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:25,088
- to live through today, Dan.
- What are you doing?

312
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:26,823
What are you doing?

313
00:16:26,859 --> 00:16:28,659
There's a crowd down there.
We have to make sure

314
00:16:28,695 --> 00:16:29,760
- they stay back.
- You want them to get back

315
00:16:29,796 --> 00:16:31,361
so I don't fall on them?

316
00:16:31,397 --> 00:16:35,231
- I just want everyone safe.
- You know what he's doing?

317
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:36,333
Whatever he has to.

318
00:16:38,972 --> 00:16:40,705
Talk to me about Rachel, Dan.

319
00:16:40,741 --> 00:16:42,106
Is there a number
I could reach her at?

320
00:16:42,142 --> 00:16:43,841
Let her know that
you're up here?

321
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:44,976
She can read about it
on the Internet.

322
00:16:45,012 --> 00:16:46,376
I've already made up my mind.

323
00:16:49,081 --> 00:16:51,982
Okay, just back a foot, Dan.
Can you do that for me?

324
00:16:54,655 --> 00:16:57,621
Just back the length
of your foot.

325
00:16:57,657 --> 00:16:59,723
Just a little bit.

326
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,324
Come on, Dan.
Let's get Rachel on the phone

327
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,027
and see what she says.

328
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,695
Ah, it'll just take a minute.
What's her number?

329
00:17:05,731 --> 00:17:06,731
Dan, what's her number?

330
00:17:10,714 --> 00:17:12,518
Lieutenant!

331
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,516
Now!

332
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:21,069
No, no, no!

333
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:22,271
Call the medics
to the roof.

334
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,139
We're clear for
medical support.

335
00:17:24,175 --> 00:17:27,483
You've ruined everything.
I made up my mind.

336
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:29,979
I made up my mind.

337
00:17:35,945 --> 00:17:37,953
Nice work, Matt.
That was a hell of a thing.

338
00:17:37,989 --> 00:17:39,313
Nice work, yourself.

339
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,044
We got him sedated.

340
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,692
His blood pressure's high,
and his back is bruised,

341
00:17:48,728 --> 00:17:50,335
- but he's gonna be fine.
- I'll track down his sister

342
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:51,857
and let her know.
Where you taking him?

343
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:53,269
- Med.
- Okay.

344
00:18:00,311 --> 00:18:02,244
Hallelujah.

345
00:18:03,848 --> 00:18:05,932
Yeah, I guess you couldn't
see it from down here,

346
00:18:05,968 --> 00:18:07,032
but that guy was gonna go.

347
00:18:07,068 --> 00:18:08,435
No question about it.

348
00:18:08,471 --> 00:18:10,236
He was calm.
He was using trigger words,

349
00:18:10,272 --> 00:18:11,905
so I made a call.

350
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:13,736
Now, if it's liability
you're worried about,

351
00:18:13,772 --> 00:18:15,942
put it on me.
I'll take the heat.

352
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:20,579
Let's go.

353
00:18:31,928 --> 00:18:34,895
- We need some new games.
- What's wrong with dominos?

354
00:18:34,931 --> 00:18:36,432
It's too much math.

355
00:18:39,935 --> 00:18:42,239
Welcome back, Chief.

356
00:18:48,477 --> 00:18:50,476
- Hey there.
- Hi, Stella.

357
00:18:50,512 --> 00:18:52,078
You looking for Kelly?
'Cause he's...

358
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:55,080
Oh, oh, no.
I, um...

359
00:18:55,116 --> 00:18:58,387
I'm actually here to, um...

360
00:18:59,454 --> 00:19:03,356
see Sylvie.
There she is.

361
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,663
Yep.
There she is.

362
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:11,431
Am I crazy,

363
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:13,633
or is there a weird
vibe here today?

364
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:15,702
'Cause everyone seems way tense
out on the floor.

365
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:19,241
It's been a crazy shift.
What's up?

366
00:19:20,142 --> 00:19:22,509
I've had the best time
being here in Chicago.

367
00:19:22,545 --> 00:19:24,377
- I'm so glad you came.
- You are?

368
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,979
- Of course.
- 'cause I would never want

369
00:19:26,015 --> 00:19:27,981
to put you out or...
or get in your way.

370
00:19:28,017 --> 00:19:29,983
You're not putting me out.
I've loved having you here.

371
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:31,685
Thanks.

372
00:19:31,721 --> 00:19:35,221
Oh, my mom sent me
a box of those cookies

373
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,548
that you've always loved.

374
00:19:36,584 --> 00:19:39,291
The pecan ones.

375
00:19:39,327 --> 00:19:42,095
That's so sweet.
Please thank her for me.

376
00:19:42,131 --> 00:19:45,098
I'm gonna see you again before
you leave for Fowlerton, right?

377
00:19:45,134 --> 00:19:46,198
- Definitely.
- Good.

378
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,746
Maybe it's not that bad.

379
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:04,353
Herrmann said Mullins is pals
with half of Headquarters.

380
00:20:06,388 --> 00:20:09,321
I'm sure it'll be fine.
I'm just saying,

381
00:20:09,357 --> 00:20:11,558
his is not a good
naughty list to be on.

382
00:20:11,594 --> 00:20:14,027
Guy wants to ding me,
let him ding me.

383
00:20:14,063 --> 00:20:16,562
He's got a stick up his ass
the size of the Sears Tower.

384
00:20:16,598 --> 00:20:19,499
Mullins? He's gone.
I just saw Boden pull up.

385
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:22,339
Oh, thank God
for small favors.

386
00:20:45,693 --> 00:20:47,493
Don't shoot the messenger.

387
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:50,466
Why is there
said messenger to shoot, huh?

388
00:20:55,538 --> 00:20:57,704
- What is he doing here?
- How should I know?

389
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,540
I'm not part of
this cockamamie plan.

390
00:21:00,576 --> 00:21:02,108
What are you doing here?

391
00:21:02,144 --> 00:21:03,710
Joe keeps leaving
me messages, man.

392
00:21:03,746 --> 00:21:05,779
It's getting weird.
I just wanna tell him.

393
00:21:05,815 --> 00:21:08,781
- Hey.
- Sup?

394
00:21:08,817 --> 00:21:10,483
- What's up with you?
- Leon.

395
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,752
Focus.
We cannot tell your brother.

396
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:14,820
- We've come this far.
- Well, it's gotten stupid.

397
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,693
He's right, Mouch.
When he's right, he's right.

398
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,560
- It's a surprise party.
- So we do the surprise now.

399
00:21:21,596 --> 00:21:23,495
Yeah, Mouch, before
it gets out of hand.

400
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:25,165
O... okay.
All right.

401
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:29,135
Imagine, if you will,
Cruz walking into Molly's

402
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:30,770
after shift.
Suddenly,

403
00:21:30,806 --> 00:21:35,108
all of his dearest friends
shout, "Happy Birthday."

404
00:21:35,144 --> 00:21:38,410
Oh, he's overjoyed.
Could it get any better?

405
00:21:38,446 --> 00:21:40,780
Yes, it could,
because out of the back

406
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:44,783
comes the most important person
to him in the world.

407
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:46,319
Leon.

408
00:21:46,355 --> 00:21:48,221
- Yeah, that does sound dope.
- I know, it does.

409
00:21:48,257 --> 00:21:50,456
I know it sounds dope.

410
00:21:50,492 --> 00:21:51,523
Hide him.

411
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,802
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

412
00:22:03,838 --> 00:22:06,539
- What's going on with you?
- Not much.

413
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:11,511
Chief wants everyone
in the bullpen.

414
00:22:11,547 --> 00:22:14,513
- Five minutes.
- Uh, you mean right now?

415
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:16,515
- What?
- I mean, he probably

416
00:22:16,551 --> 00:22:18,217
wants us there now?

417
00:22:19,721 --> 00:22:21,553
- Hey, I'm just gonna...
- Why don't you just go...

418
00:22:21,589 --> 00:22:23,556
- I just wanna have my sandwich.
- Come on, let's go.

419
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:27,127
- Check it out.
- So, I'm sorry I was gone

420
00:22:27,163 --> 00:22:29,829
this morning.
I had a seminar to teach

421
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:32,565
at the academy, and, uh,
feeling pretty good about it,

422
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,634
if I'm being honest.

423
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:37,837
Shaping young minds.
So, since, uh, I missed

424
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:39,806
the morning briefing,
I wanted to get back

425
00:22:39,842 --> 00:22:41,840
to normal business
as soon as possible.

426
00:22:41,876 --> 00:22:45,345
So, as you all may have noticed,
the bullpen has been

427
00:22:45,381 --> 00:22:47,813
a bit short-staffed since
Mrs. Donovan retired.

428
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:51,583
So, um, fortunately that
has all been addressed.

429
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:53,720
We have a new member
of our support team,

430
00:22:53,756 --> 00:22:56,589
and I believe some
of you already know her.

431
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,258
Can you come out here, please?

432
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,226
Finish that paperwork later.
So please welcome

433
00:23:01,262 --> 00:23:05,365
to the Firehouse 51 family
Hope Jacquinot.

434
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:21,640
Hey.

435
00:23:21,676 --> 00:23:24,142
Hope, what's going on?

436
00:23:24,178 --> 00:23:25,440
I'm sure you're a little
freaked I didn't tell you

437
00:23:25,476 --> 00:23:28,045
I was applying for the job,
but the thing is,

438
00:23:28,081 --> 00:23:30,082
I knew that if I did,
you'd feel pressured

439
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:32,016
to talk to Chief Boden for me,
and I didn't want

440
00:23:32,052 --> 00:23:33,986
to do that to you.
I figured that,

441
00:23:34,022 --> 00:23:35,787
I'll get this job
on my own merits,

442
00:23:35,823 --> 00:23:37,790
or I don't deserve it.

443
00:23:37,826 --> 00:23:40,492
I didn't even know that
you were looking in Chicago.

444
00:23:40,528 --> 00:23:42,093
I wasn't.

445
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,763
These last three weeks,
they've been amazing.

446
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,166
I mean, I see you,
and I'm just so impressed

447
00:23:47,202 --> 00:23:49,567
and blown away.
Anyway, I was up here

448
00:23:49,603 --> 00:23:52,036
and I saw the job posting
on the bulletin board,

449
00:23:52,072 --> 00:23:55,173
and I thought,
"Why the hell not, Hope?

450
00:23:55,209 --> 00:23:58,142
What's stopping you?
Fowlerton?"

451
00:23:58,178 --> 00:24:00,179
Ugh.

452
00:24:00,215 --> 00:24:02,781
I just... I wish
you had told me.

453
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:05,217
Well, now I do, too.

454
00:24:05,253 --> 00:24:07,585
But I really thought that
I was being a good friend

455
00:24:07,621 --> 00:24:13,191
by leaving you out of it.
And I was hoping

456
00:24:13,227 --> 00:24:17,962
that you'd be happy
if I got the job.

457
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,198
I am.
I-I really am.

458
00:24:20,234 --> 00:24:21,933
Oh, my God.
Thank you.

459
00:24:21,969 --> 00:24:25,603
You're the best, Sylvie.

460
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:28,573
I mean that.

461
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:30,708
Okay.

462
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,689
Don't.

463
00:24:44,725 --> 00:24:46,992
Well, it seems we've got
a little breakdown

464
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:48,794
at the air traffic
control tower.

465
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,094
No, I mean it.
I'm serious.

466
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,964
A little crash
on the runway action.

467
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,966
Just planes knocking
into each other.

468
00:24:54,002 --> 00:24:59,475
Ooh, it's rough.
Wreckage everywhere.

469
00:25:00,608 --> 00:25:02,511
Everywhere!

470
00:25:05,013 --> 00:25:07,813
Life classes...
okay, bye.

471
00:25:07,849 --> 00:25:10,782
Hey, so, uh,
what do you know

472
00:25:10,818 --> 00:25:12,117
about this Hope chick?

473
00:25:12,153 --> 00:25:14,652
Seems, um,
well, I don't know.

474
00:25:14,688 --> 00:25:16,621
I've spent all
of five minutes with her.

475
00:25:16,657 --> 00:25:18,156
- What's Brett saying?
- She's...

476
00:25:18,192 --> 00:25:20,762
- She's what?
- Supposed to be great.

477
00:25:23,997 --> 00:25:25,564
- Oh, do you need to...
- Yeah.

478
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,735
Okay.

479
00:25:29,203 --> 00:25:32,137
I need to get all of your
current incident reports.

480
00:25:32,173 --> 00:25:34,273
I don't turn those in
until the 31st.

481
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:36,307
Chief Mullins' office
requested them

482
00:25:36,343 --> 00:25:40,312
- along with your personnel file.
- What?

483
00:25:40,348 --> 00:25:42,714
I just do what I'm told.

484
00:25:57,631 --> 00:26:00,032
Hey, what's up, buddy?
You seem stressed.

485
00:26:00,068 --> 00:26:01,566
Do I?

486
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:03,267
Twice now I've reached
out to Leon,

487
00:26:03,303 --> 00:26:04,769
and it's gone straight
to voicemail.

488
00:26:04,805 --> 00:26:06,337
He's declining my calls.

489
00:26:06,373 --> 00:26:09,207
- Why would he do that?
- I don't know, Otis.

490
00:26:09,243 --> 00:26:10,909
But something's not right.
I know it.

491
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:13,210
Well, he's probably
just got bad reception.

492
00:26:13,246 --> 00:26:16,180
I read a study that
a lot of carriers do that.

493
00:26:16,216 --> 00:26:19,317
Send a call to voicemail
when the reception's bad.

494
00:26:19,353 --> 00:26:23,087
- They did a study on that?
- Ah, well, yeah.

495
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,626
Yeah, yeah.

496
00:26:30,031 --> 00:26:32,134
Come on,
he bought it.

497
00:26:33,834 --> 00:26:35,601
Hello?

498
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:37,268
Hi, yes.
Can, uh...

499
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,304
Can I help you?

500
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,274
Uh, I was told the people who
helped my brother work here.

501
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,942
- Who?
- Dan Harris.

502
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:49,214
He was...
He was on a roof today.

503
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,016
- Rachel?
- Yeah.

504
00:26:52,052 --> 00:26:55,219
Yeah, he, uh...
He talked about you.

505
00:26:55,255 --> 00:26:57,622
- He did?
- Yeah.

506
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,925
Come on in.

507
00:26:59,961 --> 00:27:02,194
- How is he?
- Sedated.

508
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:05,200
They did an MRI on his back.

509
00:27:06,134 --> 00:27:07,399
He took a pretty hard hit.

510
00:27:07,435 --> 00:27:11,937
I'm... I'm just so happy
that he's alive.

511
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:16,708
Um, have a seat.

512
00:27:20,415 --> 00:27:24,850
It's not that we didn't know
that he had problems.

513
00:27:24,886 --> 00:27:31,023
He... He saw a therapist before,
but he stopped going.

514
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:34,092
He stopped taking
his medication.

515
00:27:34,128 --> 00:27:38,162
"Maybe he's better,"
I told myself.

516
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,401
Magically better.

517
00:27:42,102 --> 00:27:45,070
Well, best thing now is you
can get him back into it.

518
00:27:50,244 --> 00:27:52,009
This was found
at the hospital.

519
00:27:53,915 --> 00:27:57,853
My baby brother was on a roof
today with a will in his pocket.

520
00:28:03,157 --> 00:28:04,890
If it wasn't for you,
I would be planning

521
00:28:04,926 --> 00:28:06,992
a funeral right now.
But instead we're

522
00:28:07,028 --> 00:28:08,759
figuring out treatment.

523
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:17,035
I wanted to take
a moment and thank you.

524
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:19,438
Thank you all.
It's probably just

525
00:28:19,474 --> 00:28:22,774
another alarm bell to you,
but to some of us,

526
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:25,076
what you do for us
is the whole world.

527
00:28:25,112 --> 00:28:29,915
Yeah, we're grateful
you're there for him.

528
00:28:29,951 --> 00:28:32,183
Keep him healthy.

529
00:28:32,219 --> 00:28:35,786
I will.

530
00:28:49,035 --> 00:28:51,769
Okay, come on.
Nope.

531
00:28:51,805 --> 00:28:53,471
- You little bastard.
- I've been thinking.

532
00:28:53,507 --> 00:28:55,474
Joe.
Yeah?

533
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:59,844
All this talk of Leon,
maybe I should reach out

534
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,814
to the Insane Kings.
See if things have blown over.

535
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,883
Yeah, you know, Joe,
they have, uh,

536
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,053
they have the word "insane"
right there in the title.

537
00:29:08,089 --> 00:29:09,254
So I... You know, I wouldn't...

538
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,022
Come with me.

539
00:29:11,058 --> 00:29:13,792
Strength in numbers.
I would feel so much better

540
00:29:13,828 --> 00:29:16,732
if I had backup.

541
00:29:18,432 --> 00:29:21,803
- Okay.
- Thanks, brother.

542
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:26,837
Oh, wow.

543
00:29:26,873 --> 00:29:29,240
- Don't ever do that.
- Abort, okay?

544
00:29:29,276 --> 00:29:31,509
- Abort.
- We're on the two yard line.

545
00:29:31,545 --> 00:29:33,879
He wants to go
to gang corners, okay?

546
00:29:33,915 --> 00:29:36,314
- And ask around about Leon.
- Aww.

547
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,948
No, not "Aww."
It's not a good idea.

548
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,451
We'll get him to Molly's
before he can travel

549
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,021
- to gang corners.
- I got cold feet, Mouch.

550
00:29:43,057 --> 00:29:46,390
- Scared, cold feet.
- Keep it together.

551
00:29:46,426 --> 00:29:48,927
Be strong, man.

552
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,332
- Lieutenant Casey.
- Yeah?

553
00:29:54,368 --> 00:29:56,133
Chief Boden would like
to see you.

554
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,372
You, too, Dawson.

555
00:30:04,311 --> 00:30:06,481
Lieutenant.

556
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,916
- Chief.
- Anything you wanna tell me

557
00:30:10,952 --> 00:30:13,150
about a jumper call
while I was out?

558
00:30:22,444 --> 00:30:24,538
Chief, it was a
complicated situation.

559
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:27,352
But I stand by my decision
and my team.

560
00:30:27,388 --> 00:30:30,003
Lieutenant, I came to 51
knowing

561
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:33,479
this house has a reputation
for doing things its own way.

562
00:30:33,515 --> 00:30:36,142
And I know Chief Boden has
a sharp eye for leadership,

563
00:30:36,178 --> 00:30:37,910
but let me tell you something,
Lieutenant.

564
00:30:37,946 --> 00:30:40,859
That rope rescue was like
nothing I've ever seen.

565
00:30:40,895 --> 00:30:43,542
No other firefighter I know
would have risked it.

566
00:30:43,604 --> 00:30:46,927
But if any other truck had
responded to that call,

567
00:30:46,963 --> 00:30:49,162
that young man would be
dead right now.

568
00:30:49,198 --> 00:30:52,465
You put the victim first.
Even after you knew

569
00:30:52,501 --> 00:30:54,968
I was on scene.
And you knew you were already

570
00:30:55,004 --> 00:30:57,405
on my hit list.

571
00:30:57,441 --> 00:31:01,042
You put his life ahead
of your career.

572
00:31:05,415 --> 00:31:07,314
All of Truck 81 did.

573
00:31:10,087 --> 00:31:12,954
Spoken like a true leader.

574
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:16,281
Which is why I've recommended
you for a meritorious promotion.

575
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:27,200
I don't know what to say.

576
00:31:27,236 --> 00:31:28,735
You don't have
to say anything.

577
00:31:28,771 --> 00:31:30,737
You earned this, Matt.

578
00:31:30,773 --> 00:31:35,475
Not just on this call,
but every shift and every bell.

579
00:31:35,511 --> 00:31:38,745
Look, it's not gonna be official
until the ceremony,

580
00:31:38,781 --> 00:31:40,715
but let me be
the first to tell you.

581
00:31:40,751 --> 00:31:43,417
Congratulations,
Captain Casey.

582
00:31:46,757 --> 00:31:48,555
Thanks, Chief.
I'll do my best

583
00:31:48,591 --> 00:31:50,023
to make you proud.

584
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:51,758
I know you will.
Go get them.

585
00:31:58,601 --> 00:32:02,035
Chief, thank you.

586
00:32:04,273 --> 00:32:05,773
All right,
so look for anything

587
00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:08,641
that's obviously out of date.
Use your discretion.

588
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:11,312
- Okay, I can do that.
- I mean, if Capp hasn't

589
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:13,446
sold this ab lounger by now...

590
00:32:15,585 --> 00:32:17,784
Technically, it's not part
of the job description,

591
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,320
but the Chief does not
like clutter.

592
00:32:19,356 --> 00:32:22,559
Got it.
Any other tips I should know?

593
00:32:24,161 --> 00:32:26,193
Things to look out for?
Chief Boden?

594
00:32:26,229 --> 00:32:29,096
Don't turn this Firehouse
into "Melrose Place."

595
00:32:29,132 --> 00:32:30,464
You'll do just fine.

596
00:32:39,108 --> 00:32:41,475
Hey.

597
00:32:41,511 --> 00:32:42,709
You got a minute?

598
00:32:42,745 --> 00:32:46,147
Sure.

599
00:32:46,183 --> 00:32:47,615
Just so you know,
I think it's better

600
00:32:47,651 --> 00:32:53,254
if we leave what happened
as what happened.

601
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:58,158
- Oh, okay, yeah.
- I mean, you're great.

602
00:32:58,194 --> 00:33:00,293
And I had a really
good time last night.

603
00:33:00,329 --> 00:33:02,696
But now that I'm working here,
I just don't want it

604
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:05,498
to be a thing.
You know?

605
00:33:05,534 --> 00:33:07,435
Yeah, no.
That makes total sense.

606
00:33:07,471 --> 00:33:09,437
I just want to make
a good impression,

607
00:33:09,473 --> 00:33:13,306
and I get a feeling that Connie
has eyes on everything.

608
00:33:13,342 --> 00:33:16,610
- Yeah, I'm sure she does.
- So, we're cool?

609
00:33:16,646 --> 00:33:18,579
Uh, yeah.
Absolutely.

610
00:33:18,615 --> 00:33:20,548
Great.

611
00:33:27,424 --> 00:33:29,156
Okay, Otis.
Let's beat the bushes.

612
00:33:29,192 --> 00:33:31,458
Oh, yeah.
Um...

613
00:33:31,494 --> 00:33:33,427
I actually have
to cover Molly's tonight.

614
00:33:33,463 --> 00:33:36,696
But... But,
uh, we can go after shift.

615
00:33:36,732 --> 00:33:39,332
At, like, two in the morning,
when all the finest

616
00:33:39,368 --> 00:33:41,601
- gang members are out there.
- That's a good point.

617
00:33:41,637 --> 00:33:44,205
Hey, Joe,
you know what you need?

618
00:33:44,241 --> 00:33:46,107
A good old-fashioned night

619
00:33:46,143 --> 00:33:48,208
of sucking the apple
from the barrel.

620
00:33:48,244 --> 00:33:50,377
- What?
- That is not a thing.

621
00:33:50,413 --> 00:33:52,745
Sure it is.
It means tying one on.

622
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,447
At Molly's, tonight.

623
00:33:54,483 --> 00:33:57,383
- That is a thing.
- Otis has to work anyway,

624
00:33:57,419 --> 00:34:00,254
and our Lieutenant got promoted.
That, my friends,

625
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,754
is a cause for celebration.

626
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,725
And Herrmann and Otis
have generously offered

627
00:34:04,761 --> 00:34:06,327
a buy one get one free.

628
00:34:06,363 --> 00:34:08,762
- Oh.
- Eh, wrong, no.

629
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:11,731
Buy one, get one.
No free.

630
00:34:11,767 --> 00:34:13,434
Still.

631
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:16,303
Okay, okay.
But after shift,

632
00:34:16,339 --> 00:34:17,805
we go gang hunting.

633
00:34:17,841 --> 00:34:20,243
After shift, absolutely.

634
00:34:22,946 --> 00:34:25,512
- I wasn't even worried.
- Really?

635
00:34:25,548 --> 00:34:27,747
'Cause I thought I was gonna be
working airport duty

636
00:34:27,783 --> 00:34:29,816
- for the next ten years.
- I'd do something like that,

637
00:34:29,852 --> 00:34:33,586
I'd end up in jail.
With you, it's "meritorious."

638
00:34:33,622 --> 00:34:35,890
Hey, hey, why don't
you meritoriously

639
00:34:35,926 --> 00:34:37,358
go and get us some more beers?

640
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:40,861
Aye aye, Captain.

641
00:34:44,968 --> 00:34:46,800
Three?

642
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:47,800
Ah.

643
00:34:52,776 --> 00:34:58,912
Did you need one more?
For, uh, Hope over there?

644
00:34:58,948 --> 00:35:01,414
Nah, we're cool.
We talked.

645
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,184
- Mmm-hmm.
- She didn't want

646
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,417
- to make it a thing.
- Oh, when they say

647
00:35:04,453 --> 00:35:06,220
they don't wanna
make it a thing,

648
00:35:06,256 --> 00:35:09,856
- it's already a thing.
- You're paranoid.

649
00:35:09,892 --> 00:35:11,358
I'm para-right.

650
00:35:11,394 --> 00:35:13,827
You'll see.

651
00:35:15,731 --> 00:35:17,564
Oh, hey!

652
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,767
I just got
the signal from Mouch.

653
00:35:19,803 --> 00:35:21,769
Incoming.
Incoming.

654
00:35:21,805 --> 00:35:24,305
Guys!

655
00:35:24,341 --> 00:35:26,020
Let's go.
Let's go.

656
00:35:26,056 --> 00:35:27,692
I'm going.

657
00:35:30,274 --> 00:35:31,765
You know what, you guys,
I can't do this.

658
00:35:31,801 --> 00:35:32,489
I'm just gonna go home.

659
00:35:32,525 --> 00:35:33,581
- Oh.
- What? No.

660
00:35:33,617 --> 00:35:35,416
- Celebrating, remember?
- I'm just not

661
00:35:35,452 --> 00:35:36,983
- in the mood for people.
- You know what's good

662
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:38,419
when you're not
in the mood for people?

663
00:35:38,455 --> 00:35:39,986
- Beer.
- I have beer at home.

664
00:35:40,022 --> 00:35:42,123
One drink.
You wanna support Casey,

665
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:43,447
- don't you?
- I'm gonna see Casey

666
00:35:43,483 --> 00:35:44,591
every shift for
the rest of my life.

667
00:35:44,627 --> 00:35:46,360
- I can support him later.
- Come on, Joe.

668
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:47,961
What kind of
an attitude is that?

669
00:35:47,997 --> 00:35:51,365
Exactly. I'm just gonna
bring everybody down.

670
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:54,001
You know, you know,
now that I think about it,

671
00:35:54,037 --> 00:35:56,503
We should do that
buy one get one free.

672
00:35:56,539 --> 00:35:57,575
Oh.

673
00:35:59,508 --> 00:36:01,307
Fine.
One drink.

674
00:36:01,343 --> 00:36:03,611
Attaboy.

675
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,897
- Just one, though.
- I swear.

676
00:36:05,933 --> 00:36:06,483
I promise.
I know.

677
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:07,581
I don't wanna be
here all night.

678
00:36:10,053 --> 00:36:13,723
Happy birthday, bro!

679
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:22,428
- Surprise!
- Happy birthday!

680
00:36:22,464 --> 00:36:24,398
- You were surprised, right?
- Are you kidding me?

681
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:26,367
I've been so spun out
about this whole Leon thing

682
00:36:26,403 --> 00:36:28,269
I completely forgot
it was my birthday.

683
00:36:29,638 --> 00:36:31,938
- Thank you, guys.
- Don't thank us yet,

684
00:36:31,974 --> 00:36:34,179
because here's an
even bigger surprise.

685
00:36:34,215 --> 00:36:37,910
Funny you should mention Leon,
because here he is.

686
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,816
What?

687
00:36:45,555 --> 00:36:50,327
I said, regarding Leon,
here he is.

688
00:36:55,532 --> 00:36:56,697
Is this supposed to be
some sort of joke?

689
00:36:56,733 --> 00:36:58,165
What? No.
He's... he's here.

690
00:36:58,201 --> 00:37:00,233
- Right.
- No, no, he really is.

691
00:37:00,269 --> 00:37:02,869
- No, Mouch brought him here.
- Yeah, and Otis helped him.

692
00:37:02,905 --> 00:37:04,570
Okay, just stop, guys,
all right?

693
00:37:04,606 --> 00:37:05,706
I don't know what
game you're pulling.

694
00:37:05,742 --> 00:37:08,608
I swear, he was just here.

695
00:37:08,644 --> 00:37:11,277
- Mouch, what did you do?
- I... I... I'll...

696
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:14,081
Wait, I know what you did.

697
00:37:14,117 --> 00:37:15,681
- You do?
- Mmm-hmm.

698
00:37:15,717 --> 00:37:20,152
Because Leon is
right over there.

699
00:37:20,188 --> 00:37:23,559
Ha ha!

700
00:37:29,132 --> 00:37:30,563
I don't understand.

701
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:31,764
You can't beat
the Cruz brothers.

702
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,766
It can't be done.
Can't do it.

703
00:37:33,802 --> 00:37:35,936
- How long have you known?
- Since I was at the Firehouse.

704
00:37:35,972 --> 00:37:38,279
He told me he figured it out,
and we were gonna spin it

705
00:37:38,315 --> 00:37:40,172
- back on you.
- Oh, he did, huh?

706
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:42,163
Ah, and that whole thing about
you wanting me to go with you

707
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:44,645
- and meet those gang members?
- That's what you get

708
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:48,315
- for helping Mouch.
- Oh, thank God.

709
00:37:48,351 --> 00:37:51,150
Seriously, Mouch.
This is amazing.

710
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,987
- I really appreciate it.
- Hey, the way you

711
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:55,939
took care of me
after my heart attack,

712
00:37:55,975 --> 00:37:59,112
I'll never forget that.
Least I could do.

713
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:04,247
Hey, everybody.
Buy one get one free

714
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:05,983
all night long.

715
00:38:06,019 --> 00:38:10,287
Aw, come on!
I saved you from a heart attack!

716
00:38:10,323 --> 00:38:11,988
Get over here.
Get over here.

717
00:38:12,024 --> 00:38:16,662
Aww.
Happy birthday, buddy.

718
00:38:19,832 --> 00:38:23,002
- Sylvie.
- Hey, Connie.

719
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,903
- What?
- I just got a call

720
00:38:26,939 --> 00:38:29,405
- from Fowlerton.
- Uh, what do you mean?

721
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:31,742
Did you know that
your friend Hope

722
00:38:31,778 --> 00:38:34,343
stole 10 grand
from her last boss?

723

00:07:24,565 --> 00:07:25,999
Let 'em know we got a few empty

167
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:28,001
O2 bottles here for pickup.

168
00:07:28,035 --> 00:07:30,170
Just... Chief doesn't like them
sitting around for too long.

169
00:07:30,204 --> 00:07:32,272
Absolutely. I'm on it.

170
00:07:34,275 --> 00:07:36,042
What's she so bubbly about?

171
00:07:36,077 --> 00:07:38,144
It's a long story.

172
00:07:44,785 --> 00:07:46,686
HQ needs these before the ceremony.

173
00:07:46,721 --> 00:07:49,222
It's in three hours.

174
00:07:49,256 --> 00:07:50,824
Thanks.

175
00:07:50,858 --> 00:07:53,393
Oof. Big day.

176
00:07:53,427 --> 00:07:55,495
[sighs] I've barely had
a chance to let it sink in,

177
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:57,263
all this last minute red tape.

178
00:07:57,298 --> 00:07:59,199
Better get used to that...

179
00:07:59,233 --> 00:08:01,334
Sir.

180
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:03,970
Captain. [laughs]

181
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,408
- [sighs]
- Hey! Hey, get out of there.

182
00:08:08,442 --> 00:08:10,610
Get out of there... uh!

183
00:08:10,644 --> 00:08:12,278
- Hey...
- Get your hands off me!

184
00:08:12,313 --> 00:08:13,680
- Stay right there.
- Hey.

185
00:08:13,714 --> 00:08:15,081
- What's going on?
- This one was

186
00:08:15,116 --> 00:08:16,583
trying to loot my truck.

187
00:08:16,617 --> 00:08:17,684
- Caught him in the act.
- Looting?

188
00:08:17,718 --> 00:08:19,018
I saw the CB radio inside.

189
00:08:19,053 --> 00:08:20,553
I was trying to call for help.

190
00:08:20,588 --> 00:08:21,888
Thug's just looking for an excuse

191
00:08:21,922 --> 00:08:23,356
to break into my property.

192
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:25,024
Thug? Did you call me a thug?

193
00:08:25,059 --> 00:08:26,393
- Hey, hey! That's enough.
- Come on, man.

194
00:08:26,427 --> 00:08:28,061
- She's not worth it.
- Dude,

195
00:08:28,095 --> 00:08:29,429
don't get in my face,
telling me what's worth it.

196
00:08:29,463 --> 00:08:32,298
[rumbling]

197
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,466
Oh, my God.

198
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:35,468
Okay. Only a tremor.

199
00:08:35,503 --> 00:08:37,937
Structure's still settling
after the collapse.

200
00:08:37,972 --> 00:08:39,939
Doesn't mean we're safe, though.
We need to work together.

201
00:08:39,974 --> 00:08:41,641
She's right. Could be a while

202
00:08:41,675 --> 00:08:43,977
before we're rescued.
Can't start fighting now.

203
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:45,912
I'm a firefighter, Gabby Dawson.

204
00:08:45,946 --> 00:08:47,147
- CFD's on its way.
- But who knows

205
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:49,816
how long they'll be?

206
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,651
So we need to be proactive.

207
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:54,721
Scavenge water, first aid,
try and find a way out.

208
00:08:54,755 --> 00:08:56,790
- Hey, um...
- Brandon.

209
00:08:56,824 --> 00:08:58,725
Brandon, why don't you scout the area?

210
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:03,930
See if there's a way out of here
we might not have noticed.

211
00:09:03,964 --> 00:09:05,498
Ma'am, ma'am?

212
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:07,567
Do you mind if I give a shot
at raising someone

213
00:09:07,601 --> 00:09:08,968
on that radio of yours?

214
00:09:09,003 --> 00:09:10,804
Not at all. Name's Colleen.

215
00:09:10,838 --> 00:09:12,739
Thanks, Colleen.
Meanwhile, you can search cars.

216
00:09:12,773 --> 00:09:15,942
See if there's anything we can use.

217
00:09:15,976 --> 00:09:17,677
Hey, look. I don't wanna pick a fight.

218
00:09:17,711 --> 00:09:19,579
But you should really let me
take the lead on this.

219
00:09:19,613 --> 00:09:21,247
Hey, no ego here.

220
00:09:21,282 --> 00:09:24,083
I saw an opportunity,
took the bull by the horns.

221
00:09:24,118 --> 00:09:27,320
We need you running point on medical.

222
00:09:27,354 --> 00:09:29,522
Cool?

223
00:09:29,557 --> 00:09:31,825
Good.

228

Heavy load, fresh concrete.

Morons.

230
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:51,010
So, feeling ready?

231
00:09:51,045 --> 00:09:53,146
Like rolling a boulder up
hill finishing this paperwork,

232
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,015
- but I'm almost there.
- Good.

233
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,984
'Cause there's something I'd like to do.

234
00:09:58,018 --> 00:10:00,487
I'm gonna start delegating
some duties to you right now.

235
00:10:00,521 --> 00:10:02,722
Help you get acclimated.

236
00:10:02,756 --> 00:10:04,891
Yeah, absolutely, Chief.

237
00:10:04,925 --> 00:10:06,860

- Excellent.

238

Okay, everybody, listen up.

239
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:10,663
Starting immediately, Captain Casey

240
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:13,199
will be your go-to for all
personnel related issues.

241

Scheduling, furlough, individual
requests from the department...

- He's your man.
- Copy that.

243
00:10:23,177 --> 00:10:25,211
We'll talk later.
I'll get you up to speed

244
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:26,813
on the latest union moves.

245
00:10:26,847 --> 00:10:28,181
Hey, uh, Casey,

246
00:10:28,215 --> 00:10:29,916
um, you know, that reminds me.

247
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,718
You wouldn't happen to know
if the department

248
00:10:31,752 --> 00:10:33,653
has any restrictions on firefighters

249
00:10:33,687 --> 00:10:37,290
submitting themselves
for, um, medical research?

Uh... I'm sorry?
I don't... I don't think so.

Sure you do.

254

You work at the bank.

255
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:04,417
Colleen Wilkes. I've been trying

256
00:11:04,451 --> 00:11:07,120
to refinance my mortgage.

257
00:11:07,154 --> 00:11:09,122
I'm sorry, I'm just a teller.

258
00:11:09,156 --> 00:11:13,092

- Your bosses denied me.

"The bank's not a charity."

here we are together.

- Level playing field.
- Colleen?

264
00:11:26,307 --> 00:11:28,741
You come across any first aid kits?

265
00:11:28,776 --> 00:11:30,577
No.

266
00:11:30,611 --> 00:11:32,812

00:14:37,388 --> 00:14:39,889
We need to shore
that pillar up, like, now.

330
00:14:39,924 --> 00:14:42,358
We need lumber, metal rebar,
anything we can scavenge.

331
00:14:42,393 --> 00:14:44,394
We can use seatbelts to tie it together.

332
00:14:44,428 --> 00:14:46,996
Or we get proactive.

333
00:14:47,031 --> 00:14:48,698
Dig our way out.

334
00:14:48,732 --> 00:14:50,667
There, where the ramp came down.

335
00:14:50,701 --> 00:14:53,036
Too dangerous. We don't have
the tools or the expertise.

336
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,638
Our digging could actually
trigger a collapse.

337
00:14:57,908 --> 00:14:59,109
Let's take a vote.

338
00:14:59,143 --> 00:15:00,710
No, this isn't a democracy.

339
00:15:00,744 --> 00:15:02,112
All in favor of digging our way out.

340
00:15:02,146 --> 00:15:04,981
You don't understand!

341
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:17,527
It's decided.
Let's focus on the main ramp.

342
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:20,063
Grab all the tools you can find.

343
00:15:20,097 --> 00:15:23,166
Let's go!

344
00:15:27,271 --> 00:15:28,705
Explain it to me again.

345
00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:30,573
It's real simple. Back in '09,

346
00:15:30,608 --> 00:15:32,642
Volkert on first watch
has dental surgery.

347
00:15:32,676 --> 00:15:35,311
I step up, fill in.
Figure I'm doing a solid.

348
00:15:35,346 --> 00:15:37,380
Does he repay? No.

349
00:15:37,414 --> 00:15:39,949
Eight years later,
it is a war of attrition.

350
00:15:39,984 --> 00:15:41,618
I can't blink!

351
00:15:41,652 --> 00:15:43,286
Mouch, I don't care who it is.

352
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,088
I just need one of you
to fill in next Tuesday.

353
00:15:45,122 --> 00:15:47,123
Hey, real quick, grabbing
sandwiches from Lucky's.

354
00:15:47,158 --> 00:15:48,391
You in?

355
00:15:48,425 --> 00:15:50,293
Oh, that's right.

356
00:15:50,327 --> 00:15:52,495
Damn, the Captain's work
never ends, does it?

357
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,264
Hey, keep it up. See how it pans out

358
00:15:54,298 --> 00:15:56,099
next time you want furlough approval.

359
00:15:56,133 --> 00:15:59,602
Hey, Casey,
do you have a moment in private?

360
00:15:59,637 --> 00:16:01,938
Yeah. What is it, Capp?

361
00:16:01,972 --> 00:16:03,973
Not to raise a stink,
but if you go by Cap,

362
00:16:04,008 --> 00:16:05,675
it's gonna be confusion.

363
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:07,110
You need to emphasize the "tain".

364
00:16:07,144 --> 00:16:10,813
Cap-tain.

365
00:16:11,056 --> 00:16:14,892
All right. Listen up. [sighs]

366
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,121
Let's make something clear.

367
00:16:18,155 --> 00:16:20,924
Starting tomorrow, I am responsible

368
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,992
for all three shifts on truck 81,

369
00:16:23,027 --> 00:16:25,795
plus the entire house's
personnel issues.

370
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:28,798
So please, no more trivial requests,

371
00:16:28,832 --> 00:16:32,835
- and no more surprises.
- There he is!

372
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:37,674
Oh, hey! Maxie! Ooh-hoo!

373
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:41,945
Hey, honey. Actually,
might not be the best...

374
00:16:41,979 --> 00:16:43,546
What is this?

375
00:16:43,581 --> 00:16:46,683
Uh... surprise.

376
00:16:46,717 --> 00:16:49,219
They've been asked to thank
someone whose hard work

377
00:16:49,253 --> 00:16:51,554
and dedication inspires them.

378
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:54,123
Weird. Didn't pick his old man.

379
00:16:54,158 --> 00:16:55,858
To thank you for
your service to the city,

380
00:16:55,893 --> 00:16:58,361
we got you a gift.

381
00:16:58,395 --> 00:16:59,996
His name is Mr. Sprinkles.

382
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,999
We think he'd be a very good
firefighter mascot.

383
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:16,579
I just wanna clear the air
and say there's absolutely

384
00:17:16,614 --> 00:17:19,882
no truth to this ugly rumor
going around about Hope.

385
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:22,552
- It's... you haven't heard?
- No.

386
00:17:22,586 --> 00:17:24,988
But I'm gonna hear about it right now.

387
00:17:25,022 --> 00:17:27,523
So Hope got into a little bit
of trouble back home.

388
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:30,260
Bad relationship, guy accused
her of stealing some money.

389
00:17:30,294 --> 00:17:32,161
How much?

390
00:17:32,196 --> 00:17:34,330
Give or take $10,000.

391
00:17:34,365 --> 00:17:37,367
Hi-a-watha, that's a felony.

392
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:38,701
Well, that's just it.

393
00:17:38,736 --> 00:17:40,103
I mean, she never stole anything.

394
00:17:40,137 --> 00:17:41,170
She explained it all to me.

395
00:17:41,205 --> 00:17:42,939
It's just a big nothing.

396
00:17:42,973 --> 00:17:46,175
Small town drama.

397
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:50,446
Okay, well, cool, then.

he needs to be careful

416

This is the thing. They don't learn.

418

All right, let's simmer down, Colleen.

419
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,284
Yo, I got a breaking point, okay?

420
00:19:01,318 --> 00:19:03,786
I'm with you. She's ignorant, hateful,

421
00:19:03,821 --> 00:19:05,822
and I can't wait to get away from her.

422

But she's here and we need her
just as much as she needs us.

Yeah, sounds nice.

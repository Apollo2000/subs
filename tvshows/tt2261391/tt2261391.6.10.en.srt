1
00:00:00,342 --> 00:00:03,414
I just got a call from Zach.

2
00:00:03,476 --> 00:00:06,093
We are going on a date tomorrow night.

3
00:00:06,305 --> 00:00:07,820
Hey, Tina.

4
00:00:07,845 --> 00:00:10,219
- Are you here for Bria Jamison?
- You know her?

5
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:12,155
Her dad got himself
in a mess with painkillers.

6
00:00:12,187 --> 00:00:14,429
He's in no shape to take care of her.

7
00:00:14,454 --> 00:00:16,190
Did you see a girl who was just here?

8
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,492
You and Gabby were walking
around skid row last night

9
00:00:18,527 --> 00:00:21,674
- looking for Bria?
- I thought she told you.

10
00:00:22,964 --> 00:00:24,932
- What is it?
- That was the morgue.

11
00:00:24,966 --> 00:00:27,268
A Jane Doe teenage girl just rolled in.

12
00:00:27,302 --> 00:00:29,537
She had my card in her purse.

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,341
- Hello, anybody?
- Someone's coming.

14
00:00:34,376 --> 00:00:36,343
I can hear them.

15
00:00:36,378 --> 00:00:38,512
- Sorry about that, we had a...
- Gabriela Dawson.

16
00:00:38,547 --> 00:00:39,847
You called about a Jane Doe?

17
00:00:39,881 --> 00:00:41,916
Yes, thank you for coming in.

18
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,019
I just need some identification.

19
00:00:45,053 --> 00:00:47,354
And what is your relation
to the deceased?

20
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:49,690
I'm her friend.

21
00:00:49,724 --> 00:00:51,058
Not next of kin?

22
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,460
Look, you called me.
Can I see the body or not?

23
00:00:53,495 --> 00:00:57,298
Gabby, he's just doing his job.

24
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:07,575
She was found in an alley. DOA.

25
00:01:18,753 --> 00:01:20,588
That's not my friend.

26
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,223
You sure?

27
00:01:22,257 --> 00:01:25,059
I'm sure. That is not Bria Jamison.

28
00:01:26,661 --> 00:01:28,395
Track marks.

29
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,064
Was it a drug overdose?

30
00:01:30,098 --> 00:01:33,801
ME still needs to make his
official determination, but...

31
00:01:35,871 --> 00:01:39,006
Don't know this girl at all?

32
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,774
I never saw her before.

33
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,910
So why did she have your card?

34
00:01:42,944 --> 00:01:45,613
II don't know.

35
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,814
Can I see the card?

36
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,690
That's Bria's purse.

37
00:01:56,725 --> 00:01:58,459
There were no valuables inside.

38
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:02,329
No money, no ID, no credit cards.

39
00:02:02,364 --> 00:02:04,431
It's like it was cleaned out.

40
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:06,200
You sure it's hers?

41
00:02:06,234 --> 00:02:08,279
Yeah, it's the one she went
back to the clinic fire to get.

42
00:02:08,303 --> 00:02:09,436
I remember it.

43
00:02:11,373 --> 00:02:15,309
How did this girl end up
with all of Bria's stuff?

44
00:02:22,285 --> 00:02:26,292

45
00:02:26,988 --> 00:02:30,491
HECHT. Got it.

46
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,960
Appreciate this. Thanks, Bobby.

47
00:02:32,994 --> 00:02:34,895
Okay, ran prints off the Jane Doe.

48
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,130
She was in the system.

49
00:02:36,164 --> 00:02:38,065
A couple of shoplifting charges.

50
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,567
Name's Carly Hecht. 19 years old.

51
00:02:40,602 --> 00:02:42,169
What do we know about her?

52
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,204
A couple patrol officers
visited her last known

53
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,973
this morning.
It was her boyfriend's place.

54
00:02:46,007 --> 00:02:47,541
Can I see the address?

55
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:50,344
Gabby, what're you doing?

56
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,781
This girl had Bria's stuff.
I wanna know why.

57
00:02:55,684 --> 00:02:59,687
Look, you know I can't share
information like that.

58
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,088
But you're my sister, so,

59
00:03:01,122 --> 00:03:03,657
if I were to write down an address,

60
00:03:03,692 --> 00:03:06,327
and then turn my back...

61
00:03:06,361 --> 00:03:07,661
I didn't see that.

62
00:03:07,696 --> 00:03:10,731
And that's why
you're my favorite brother.

63
00:03:10,765 --> 00:03:12,700
Thanks.

64
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,569
Hey, how's Brett doing?

65
00:03:15,603 --> 00:03:18,405
- She's good.
- Good.

66
00:03:21,876 --> 00:03:24,078
Wow, Hazmat Zach already called.

67
00:03:24,112 --> 00:03:25,428
That was fast.

68
00:03:25,453 --> 00:03:27,114
Well, after the way
you strongarmed him,

69
00:03:27,148 --> 00:03:28,882
he was probably scared to wait too long.

70
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,584
I did not strongarm him.

71
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:33,287
All I said was that you were
single and he was all over it.

72
00:03:33,321 --> 00:03:37,958
Well, he asked me for dinner
tomorrow night, to Sparrow.

73
00:03:37,993 --> 00:03:39,727
I've read about that place.

74
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,362
Sounds very cool.

75
00:03:41,396 --> 00:03:45,032
Not usually my jam,
but I said I'd give it a try.

76
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:46,967
Admit it, you're excited.

77
00:03:47,002 --> 00:03:49,436
I've had a lot of bad dates
this last year, so...

78
00:03:49,471 --> 00:03:51,805
Just say it. "I'm excited."

79
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,909
I'm cautiously optimistic.

80
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,879
But he is an attractive gentleman.

81
00:03:58,913 --> 00:04:00,414
Since when do you go for gentlemen?

82
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,751
Since I decided to improve my standards.

83
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,387
- That's a smart move.
- Don't I know it.

84
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:08,055
Come on, let's get to the cinnamon rolls

85
00:04:08,089 --> 00:04:10,224
before Connie does.

86
00:04:13,161 --> 00:04:15,129
Hey.

87
00:04:15,163 --> 00:04:17,331
You got that text from Dawson, right?

88
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:20,567
Yeah, eventually.

89
00:04:20,602 --> 00:04:22,269
It was a long night.

90
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,171
For me too.

91
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:27,474
Dawson's not the only one
who got close to Bria.

92
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:34,581
Hey, I'm just glad
it wasn't her in that morgue.

93
00:04:34,616 --> 00:04:37,084
Yeah.

94
00:04:41,956 --> 00:04:44,691
Hey, you know how Connie feels

95
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:46,160
about fire tools inside the house.

96
00:04:46,194 --> 00:04:47,694
It'll only take a minute.

97
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:50,097
I wanna connect a sledgehammer
to a Halligan bar

98
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:52,533
so one guy can set the Halligan
into a doorjamb,

99
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:54,301
and bang it into place all by himself.

100
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,770
Yeah, but those two things
together are like 22 pounds.

101
00:04:56,805 --> 00:04:58,205
It's a tool for real men.

102
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:01,041
I gotta say, it doesn't seem
like it would work.

103
00:05:01,076 --> 00:05:02,443
And if it did,

104
00:05:02,477 --> 00:05:03,954
wouldn't somebody have
invented it by now?

105
00:05:03,978 --> 00:05:05,846
Hey, no one invented the computer

106
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,957
until Bill Gates came along.

107
00:05:06,981 --> 00:05:09,283
Bill Gates didn't...

108
00:05:09,317 --> 00:05:11,652
Anyway, that thing is hardly a computer.

109
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:15,389
Nope, it isn't.

110
00:05:15,423 --> 00:05:16,990
It's a Slamigan.

111
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,193
Say that again. What...

112
00:05:19,227 --> 00:05:21,528
What're you calling this thing?

113
00:05:21,563 --> 00:05:23,997
The Slamigan.

114
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,299
We're gonna be rich.

115
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,400
Who's "we"?

116
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:29,803
Yeah, and when did "we"
decide this was a good idea?

117
00:05:29,838 --> 00:05:32,906
When he named it The Slamigan.

118
00:05:32,941 --> 00:05:36,743
Okay.

119
00:05:38,847 --> 00:05:41,048
Slamigan indeed.

120
00:05:41,082 --> 00:05:42,316
It's all right.

121
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,817
If at first you don't succeed...

122
00:05:43,852 --> 00:05:44,818
I know, I know.

123
00:05:44,853 --> 00:05:46,353
This is gonna work.

124
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,188
You just need to add a real hinge on

125
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,923
and you know, a steel plate.

126
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,335
Yeah, I guess I could get the torch out

127
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:53,160
and just braze something
together real quick.

128
00:05:53,194 --> 00:05:55,362
No, a brazed joint
won't be strong enough.

129
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,931
You wanna MIG weld it.

130
00:05:57,966 --> 00:05:59,666
I grew up in a farm.

131
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:00,711
When the cultivator threw a shank,

132
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,069
who do you think fixed it?

133
00:06:02,103 --> 00:06:04,505
Hey, Brett, can we run a little errand?

134
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:06,340
Sure.

135
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,446
Are you sure the police
already notified the boyfriend?

136
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,516
Yeah, Antonio said they were
here this morning.

137
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,851
How is Antonio?

138
00:06:17,886 --> 00:06:19,887
He's good.

139
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,088
Good.

140
00:06:21,122 --> 00:06:23,357
Okay, here we are. 102.

141
00:06:31,332 --> 00:06:33,333
Aaron?

142
00:06:34,335 --> 00:06:36,737
We're very sorry for your loss.

143
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,971
Sh...

144
00:06:38,006 --> 00:06:42,376
Carly was, like, trying to stop using.

145
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:46,446
She was tough enough to do it too.

146
00:06:46,481 --> 00:06:48,549
Did she live with you?

147
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,918
On and off.

148
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:54,755
Aaron, do you know a girl named Bria?

149
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,057
No.

150
00:06:57,091 --> 00:06:58,759
That's a... that's a weird name.

151
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,962
Carly never mentioned it?

152
00:07:01,996 --> 00:07:04,064
Are you sure?

153
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:06,166
She's younger than Carly.
Long, dark hair.

154
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:08,902
They may have met recently.

155
00:07:08,937 --> 00:07:11,471
If it was from, like,
last week or whatever,

156
00:07:11,506 --> 00:07:15,742
I wouldn't know anything about it.

157
00:07:15,777 --> 00:07:18,111
We had a big fight on Saturday,

158
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:21,215
and then she just took off.

159
00:07:21,382 --> 00:07:23,262
And I...

160
00:07:23,785 --> 00:07:25,852
never saw her after that.

161
00:07:28,122 --> 00:07:31,291
Any idea where Carly might've gone?

162
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:38,098
Maybe... maybe Safe Harbor.

163
00:07:38,132 --> 00:07:39,800
What's that?

164
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,602
Iit's a shelter on West Jackson.

165
00:07:41,636 --> 00:07:44,104
That's the only place that
Carly would've gone to.

166
00:07:44,138 --> 00:07:47,541
They just take teens.

167
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:49,776
That's really helpful. Thank you.

168
00:07:49,811 --> 00:07:52,779
We'll check it out.

169
00:07:57,252 --> 00:08:00,520
I just watched her leave.

170
00:08:00,555 --> 00:08:04,558
I... and I didn't even try to stop her.

171
00:08:09,564 --> 00:08:11,565
Aaron,

172
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,801
try to reach out to
some friends or family, okay?

173
00:08:14,836 --> 00:08:16,046
You shouldn't be alone right now.

174
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,804
<i>Ambulance 61.</i>

175
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:21,875
<i>Woman in distress, 203 East Chestnut.</i>

176
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:23,977
Copy that, 61, we're out.

177
00:08:24,012 --> 00:08:27,814
Take care of yourself.

178
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:39,826
Neighbors heard Mrs. Capizzi cry out,

179
00:08:39,861 --> 00:08:41,361
but no one answered the door.

180
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:44,231
Apartment 3205. This way.

181
00:08:48,703 --> 00:08:50,837
Fire Department, Mrs. Capizzi?

182
00:08:50,872 --> 00:08:53,323
Get in here!

183
00:08:56,711 --> 00:08:59,136
Good luck with her.

184
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:02,968
Hurry, hurry up.

185
00:09:04,952 --> 00:09:06,985
The button is jammed.

186
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,985
Help me!

187
00:09:12,884 --> 00:09:15,218
My hand, do something.

188
00:09:17,922 --> 00:09:20,021
I'm gonna disconnect it.

189
00:09:22,793 --> 00:09:24,160
No, I'm still stuck.

190
00:09:26,697 --> 00:09:28,932
Be careful.

191
00:09:29,032 --> 00:09:31,434
An oyster fork fell
and I thought I could grab it.

192
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:33,067
I think your ring is trapped

193
00:09:33,092 --> 00:09:34,404
on the side of the mechanism.

194
00:09:34,438 --> 00:09:36,539
My God, please don't let
it be the Lorraine Schwartz.

195
00:09:36,605 --> 00:09:39,907
Just a little twist here.

196
00:09:39,941 --> 00:09:44,745
No, no, no, no, no.

197
00:09:46,782 --> 00:09:48,382
It's just a small laceration.

198
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:51,318
Look at this,
my engagement ring is damaged.

199
00:09:51,353 --> 00:09:53,654
When you twisted
my hand to pull it out...

200
00:09:53,688 --> 00:09:55,823
Your ring is damaged
'cause you stuck your hand

201
00:09:55,857 --> 00:09:57,825
in a garbage disposal
before shutting it off.

202
00:09:57,859 --> 00:10:00,628
Well, that disposal
is clearly defective.

203
00:10:00,662 --> 00:10:05,232
You have no concept
of the value of this ring.

204
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:06,811
I shouldn't have been
at the sink at all,

205
00:10:06,835 --> 00:10:08,669
but my housekeeper called in sick.

206
00:10:08,703 --> 00:10:11,405
Now my ring is scratched
and I have to get stitches.

207
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,841
It's just all so unfair.

208
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,443
Unfair?

209
00:10:15,477 --> 00:10:18,078
Lady, less than half a mile
from here is a shelter for kids

210
00:10:18,113 --> 00:10:19,313
who got nowhere to go.

211
00:10:19,347 --> 00:10:20,614
Kids who could be on the street

212
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:22,616
or in a morgue or God knows where.

213
00:10:22,651 --> 00:10:24,318
Now that's unfair.

214
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:28,589
You drive.

215
00:10:28,623 --> 00:10:31,192
I'll stay in the back with Mrs. Capizzi.

216
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:38,699
And from that day forward,

217
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:41,535
he was always referred to as Brenda.

218
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,548
A lot of people don't know
that's how he got his nickname.

219
00:10:43,572 --> 00:10:45,016
They thought it was
some kind of sex thing.

220
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,340
I'm just saying.

221
00:10:46,374 --> 00:10:49,143
I wasn't there. Anyway, I gotta run.

222
00:10:49,177 --> 00:10:50,377
I expect to see you all there.

223
00:10:50,412 --> 00:10:51,779
- You got your invites.
- We do.

224
00:10:51,813 --> 00:10:53,057
- See you Friday, Chief Grissom.
- Okay.

225
00:10:53,081 --> 00:10:54,448
Anyone know, is Kelly around?

226
00:10:54,482 --> 00:10:56,316
He's, right behind you.

227
00:10:56,351 --> 00:10:57,818
- Grizz.
- There he is.

228
00:10:57,853 --> 00:10:59,563
- What're you doing here?
- Dropping these off.

229
00:10:59,587 --> 00:11:01,688
Wanna make sure your Chief gets 'em.

230
00:11:01,723 --> 00:11:03,891
- Right there.
- There he is.

231
00:11:03,925 --> 00:11:05,025
Wallace.

232
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,627
Chief.

233
00:11:06,661 --> 00:11:08,195
Casey.

234
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,499
Or should I say Captain? Wow.

235
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:12,500
Good to see you, Chief Grissom.

236
00:11:12,534 --> 00:11:14,335
What brings you to 51?

237
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:17,171
Well, I think you've had
my protégé here long enough.

238
00:11:17,205 --> 00:11:20,708
I came to reclaim him.

239
00:11:20,742 --> 00:11:23,244
I'm putting together a benefit
dinner and silent auction

240
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:25,913
for the 100 Club on Friday.
All of 51's invited.

241
00:11:25,947 --> 00:11:27,748
We're always here to support our fallen.

242
00:11:27,782 --> 00:11:29,149
I'll see to it that 51 represents.

243
00:11:29,184 --> 00:11:30,518
Thanks, Chief.

244
00:11:30,552 --> 00:11:32,230
All right, I gotta
hit up some other houses.

245
00:11:32,254 --> 00:11:33,888
You walk with me?

246
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,758
Seriously, when are you
coming back to 36?

247
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:39,860
I sent you here for Squad experience.

248
00:11:39,895 --> 00:11:41,529
Didn't expect you to stay this long.

249
00:11:41,563 --> 00:11:43,864
Well, you should've known
I'd click with Boden.

250
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:45,199
And what do you care anyway?

251
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:46,878
Aren't you hanging up
your axe in the fall?

252
00:11:46,902 --> 00:11:48,502
Don't remind me.

253
00:11:48,537 --> 00:11:50,704
Hey, let's get a couple
of beers after shift, okay?

254
00:11:50,739 --> 00:11:53,374
- Been way too long.
- Yeah, sure, sounds good.

255
00:11:53,408 --> 00:11:54,642
All right.

256
00:12:03,985 --> 00:12:07,621
Hi, um, I'm looking
for a friend of mine.

257
00:12:07,656 --> 00:12:10,457
Bria Jamison. I heard she might be here.

258
00:12:10,492 --> 00:12:13,060
We don't give out information
about our residents.

259
00:12:13,094 --> 00:12:14,895
I get it, um...

260
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,764
It's... it's just that
this is important.

261
00:12:16,798 --> 00:12:19,433
She's underage and it's
an issue of her safety.

262
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:21,769
If she's here, she's safe.

263
00:12:21,803 --> 00:12:23,671
See the sign?

264
00:12:26,341 --> 00:12:27,908
My friend's things were probably stolen

265
00:12:27,943 --> 00:12:29,743
by a resident here,
who later turned up dead

266
00:12:29,778 --> 00:12:31,412
from a drug overdose on the street,

267
00:12:31,446 --> 00:12:35,082
so "safe" is not the word
that comes to mind.

268
00:12:35,116 --> 00:12:38,218
We do the best we can
under tough circumstances.

269
00:12:38,253 --> 00:12:42,423
Part of that is keeping our
residents' information private.

270
00:12:46,328 --> 00:12:48,729
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

271
00:12:48,763 --> 00:12:50,965
I know you do your best,
and what you guys do here

272
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:52,266
is very important.

273
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,136
It's just... um... I'm just worried.

274
00:12:58,673 --> 00:13:01,909
If you do see her, Bria Jamison,

275
00:13:01,943 --> 00:13:04,645
can you tell her that Gabby
needs to know if she's okay?

276
00:13:07,215 --> 00:13:09,617
Please.

277
00:13:09,651 --> 00:13:12,319
Residents here come and go.

278
00:13:12,354 --> 00:13:15,322
I wouldn't hold your breath.

279
00:13:28,336 --> 00:13:31,972
Am I the only one having
a "Flashdance" flashback?

280
00:13:32,007 --> 00:13:33,674
You're old.

281
00:13:42,484 --> 00:13:44,118
Here it is, you guys.

282
00:13:44,152 --> 00:13:47,321
- The Slamigan.
- Patent pending.

283
00:13:47,347 --> 00:13:49,723
- Let it cool off a little first.
- No, it's good.

284
00:13:49,758 --> 00:13:52,159
That weld's a 70,000 psi
tensile strength.

285
00:13:52,193 --> 00:13:53,627
Cruz won't break it.

286
00:13:53,662 --> 00:13:57,131
Damn, girl.

287
00:14:02,037 --> 00:14:03,537
Ooh.

288
00:14:03,571 --> 00:14:05,005
Are you okay?

289
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,306
Yeah, I'm good.

290
00:14:06,341 --> 00:14:09,343
"A tool for real men."

291
00:14:09,377 --> 00:14:12,880
There's a...

292
00:14:12,914 --> 00:14:16,417
You got a little slop in the hinge.

293
00:14:17,786 --> 00:14:20,254
That's a design flaw.

294
00:14:20,288 --> 00:14:21,655
I'm gonna have to work on that.

295
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,223
But don't make it too tight either.

296
00:14:23,258 --> 00:14:24,758
We don't want it binding.

297
00:14:24,793 --> 00:14:28,028
No, "we" sure don't.

298
00:14:41,076 --> 00:14:44,278
Hey.

299
00:14:44,312 --> 00:14:47,304
You can't tell anyone you saw me.

300
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,022
And you can't make me turn myself in.

301
00:14:52,954 --> 00:14:55,537
They'll send me away.

302
00:15:12,434 --> 00:15:14,978
I mean, I'm an approved foster parent.

303
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,432
So I figure if I could petition
DCFS to let me bere.

304
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:19,799
Bria's temporary guardian until
her dad gets out of rehab,

305
00:15:19,824 --> 00:15:21,838
they... they gotta at
least consider it, right?

306
00:15:21,863 --> 00:15:24,080
I would think so.

307
00:15:26,214 --> 00:15:28,939
I left Tina Cantrell a message,
but you know how that place is.

308
00:15:28,964 --> 00:15:31,166
It could be a day or two
before she calls me back.

309
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,527
In the meantime,

310
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,777
I want Bria staying
at our place tonight.

311
00:15:39,183 --> 00:15:41,084
I know it's not 100% legit,

312
00:15:41,152 --> 00:15:43,504
until DCFS has approved, but...

313
00:15:44,689 --> 00:15:46,957
She can't go back out on the street.

314
00:15:49,594 --> 00:15:53,163
Of course she can stay with us.

315
00:15:57,835 --> 00:16:00,570
I can't believe you guys
went looking for me.

316
00:16:00,605 --> 00:16:02,372
I'm so embarrassed about all this.

317
00:16:02,407 --> 00:16:03,807
Don't be.

318
00:16:03,841 --> 00:16:07,311
Everybody needs help once in a while.

319
00:16:07,345 --> 00:16:08,712
Even you?

320
00:16:08,746 --> 00:16:11,915
Of course.

321
00:16:23,561 --> 00:16:26,663
When I was a kid,

322
00:16:26,698 --> 00:16:29,766
my dad put our family
through some rough times.

323
00:16:29,801 --> 00:16:33,003
I was lucky. A friend reached out.

324
00:16:33,037 --> 00:16:35,272
I went to live with her for a while.

325
00:16:35,306 --> 00:16:38,275
Did your dad get better?

326
00:16:41,612 --> 00:16:43,447
Not much.

327
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:46,350
But your father, he's different.

328
00:16:46,384 --> 00:16:47,784
Trust me.

329
00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:50,507
More than anything,
he wants to do right by you.

330
00:16:52,957 --> 00:16:56,046
Maybe that's what your dad wants too.

331
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:58,400
I think...

332
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:00,999
some people just can't change.

333
00:17:05,737 --> 00:17:09,673
You're a smart kid, you know that?

334
00:17:13,778 --> 00:17:16,213
Hey, here we go. Version 2.0.

335
00:17:16,247 --> 00:17:17,214
How's she looking?

336
00:17:17,248 --> 00:17:18,982
Feels pretty solid.

337
00:17:19,016 --> 00:17:21,084
I drilled out a bigger hole
on the sledge handle.

338
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,950
Then we added a thicker bushing.

339
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:26,511
Okay, Cruz, give it a
shot so I can get out of here.

340
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:37,834
That's too bad.

341
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:41,071
Slamigan would be a really great name.

342
00:17:42,206 --> 00:17:45,075
Drilled out too much wood.
It weakened the handle.

343
00:17:45,109 --> 00:17:48,945
This is a dumb idea.

344
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,880
No, come on.

345
00:17:49,914 --> 00:17:51,648
You know how many
Apollo missions there were

346
00:17:51,682 --> 00:17:53,517
before Apollo 11 put a man on the moon?

347
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:54,951
Ten.

348
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:57,854
Point is, have a little faith
in yourself, Cruz.

349
00:17:57,889 --> 00:17:59,823
Look, I don't have to be anywhere.

350
00:17:59,857 --> 00:18:01,358
Let's keep working on it.

351
00:18:01,392 --> 00:18:03,593
- You sure?
- Yeah.

352
00:18:05,696 --> 00:18:07,531
Cool.

353
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:11,743
You coming?

354
00:18:11,768 --> 00:18:13,669
Yeah.

355
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,143
Chief, are you aware that
Joe Cruz has been disrupting

356
00:18:20,178 --> 00:18:23,180
the firehouse with some
personal project of his?

357
00:18:23,214 --> 00:18:25,682
I'm aware that he's up to something.

358
00:18:25,716 --> 00:18:27,060
Would you like me to put an end to it?

359
00:18:27,084 --> 00:18:29,719
Why don't we just give it some time?

360
00:18:29,754 --> 00:18:33,723
Maybe it'll run its course.

361
00:18:33,758 --> 00:18:37,294
Severide, what is Joe Cruz up to?

362
00:18:37,328 --> 00:18:40,530
Psh, I don't know.
I'm staying out of it.

363
00:18:40,565 --> 00:18:41,731
And what's this?

364
00:18:41,766 --> 00:18:44,634
I, I wrote a letter to DCFS

365
00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:46,236
in support of Dawson and Casey.

366
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,238
Good man, I was planning on
doing the same thing.

367
00:18:48,272 --> 00:18:50,707
Hey, must've been a nice surprise

368
00:18:50,741 --> 00:18:51,975
seeing Chief Grissom?

369
00:18:52,009 --> 00:18:54,744
Yeah, yeah, it's...

370
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:56,246
It's been a while.

371
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,081
Well, I don't know if I told you,

372
00:18:58,115 --> 00:19:00,227
but he called me a couple
of times a year to grill me.

373
00:19:00,251 --> 00:19:01,428
Make sure I'm treating you well.

374
00:19:01,452 --> 00:19:02,686
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

375
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,087
Sorry about that.

376
00:19:04,121 --> 00:19:06,556
You know, my dad saved his life once.

377
00:19:06,591 --> 00:19:08,024
He dove through a collapsed roof

378
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:09,493
and pulled him out of a fire.

379
00:19:09,527 --> 00:19:11,161
So when I got out of the Academy,

380
00:19:11,195 --> 00:19:13,563
Grizz made sure that
I was assigned to his house.

381
00:19:13,598 --> 00:19:15,765
Well, I don't mind him hounding me.

382
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,944
Means they're looking out for you.

383
00:19:16,968 --> 00:19:19,269
Yeah, yeah, he always has.

384
00:19:19,303 --> 00:19:22,339
You know, he's the reason
I'm a firefighter.

385
00:19:22,373 --> 00:19:26,510
Benny, you know,
pushed me in the direction,

386
00:19:26,544 --> 00:19:28,245
but I stayed because of Grizz.

387
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:30,180
Built me up more than Benny ever did.

388
00:19:33,384 --> 00:19:35,785
I'm grabbing a beer
with him later tonight.

389
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,355
- Yeah, have a good catch up.
- Yeah, yeah.

390
00:19:38,389 --> 00:19:41,191
- I'll see you next shift.
- Yeah, see you then.

391
00:19:44,962 --> 00:19:47,864
I made up your bed for you.

392
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:51,301
And here's some extra blankets, and...

393
00:19:51,335 --> 00:19:54,204
Got some towels.

394
00:19:54,238 --> 00:19:56,039
This is super nice.

395
00:19:56,073 --> 00:19:57,974
Yeah?

396
00:19:58,009 --> 00:20:01,645
I don't know about that, but...

397
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,713
It's yours for now.

398
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,485
Do you really think the lady
at DCFS will let me stay here

399
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:11,154
until my dad's out?

400
00:20:11,188 --> 00:20:13,456
I do.

401
00:20:13,491 --> 00:20:16,293
That would be awesome.

402
00:20:16,327 --> 00:20:18,161
Mostly 'cause we never got to finish

403
00:20:18,195 --> 00:20:20,397
that Crazy Eights championship
at the hospital.

404
00:20:20,431 --> 00:20:22,599
Bring it on.

405
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:30,006
How did you get a table at this place?

406
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,175
A friend of mine works in the kitchen.

407
00:20:33,277 --> 00:20:35,645
Don't be fooled by
the pretentious sounding food.

408
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,981
It actually tastes good.

409
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,017
Okay, so, here's the thing, Zach.

410
00:20:42,053 --> 00:20:43,520
I just have to ask you

411
00:20:43,554 --> 00:20:46,022
a few questions before we order

412
00:20:46,057 --> 00:20:48,858
and become fully committed to this date.

413
00:20:48,893 --> 00:20:51,494
So right now you're
just flirting with it.

414
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:56,866
Well, yeah, this could be
several hours of our time.

415
00:20:56,901 --> 00:20:59,769
Why didn't you ask
when we talked on the phone?

416
00:20:59,804 --> 00:21:01,771
'Cause you would've thought I was rude.

417
00:21:01,806 --> 00:21:03,873
Okay.

418
00:21:03,908 --> 00:21:06,209
All right, ask away.

419
00:21:06,243 --> 00:21:07,644
Okay.

420
00:21:07,678 --> 00:21:09,546
Are you married?

421
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,483
Wait, why would I invite you
on a date if I was...

422
00:21:13,517 --> 00:21:15,852
No. No, I'm not married.

423
00:21:15,886 --> 00:21:17,320
- Do you take drugs?
- No.

424
00:21:17,355 --> 00:21:21,224
- Any mental illness?
- Only when I get hungry.

425
00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:25,562
Stella, you brave fires for a living.

426
00:21:25,596 --> 00:21:27,163
Come on, man up, commit to this date,

427
00:21:27,198 --> 00:21:29,833
so I can order the Boneln Ribeye.

428
00:21:32,603 --> 00:21:34,571
Fine.

429
00:21:34,605 --> 00:21:38,241
I will also have one of those.

430
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:40,543
So Boden says, instead of the medal,

431
00:21:40,578 --> 00:21:41,858
can I have my firefighters back?

432
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,047
The ones that Chief Anderson

433
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:45,359
has scattered all over the city?

434
00:21:45,383 --> 00:21:46,816
He says this to the mayor's guy?

435
00:21:46,851 --> 00:21:48,351
Yeah, and it... and it worked.

436
00:21:48,386 --> 00:21:50,854
Anderson about blew a gasket.
It was a thing of beauty.

437
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,925
Good to see you again, Kelly.

438
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,161
Been too long.

439
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:02,389
Here's the thing...

440
00:22:02,578 --> 00:22:04,445
As I hurdle towards retirement,

441
00:22:04,596 --> 00:22:06,063
I'm...

442
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,571
I'm looking around and I'm wondering,

443
00:22:08,606 --> 00:22:12,375
What have I done to leave the
CFD better than I found it?

444
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:15,712
That's why I'm... I'm... I'm more
involved in charities.

445
00:22:15,746 --> 00:22:17,414
I'm also looking at the firefighters

446
00:22:17,448 --> 00:22:21,751
that have come up under me.
How have they turned out?

447
00:22:21,786 --> 00:22:23,920
You tell me, Grizz.

448
00:22:23,954 --> 00:22:26,790
Honestly?

449
00:22:26,824 --> 00:22:29,025
Sure.

450
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,294
I talk to your dad about you, Kelly.

451
00:22:31,328 --> 00:22:32,562
And?

452
00:22:32,596 --> 00:22:34,264
He said that you...

453
00:22:34,298 --> 00:22:36,966
You had some setbacks, what
with Riddle busting you down...

454
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:38,776
If you wanna know
how I'm doing, just ask me.

455
00:22:38,801 --> 00:22:40,070
I am asking you.

456
00:22:40,104 --> 00:22:41,748
And you're telling me stories
about a house

457
00:22:41,772 --> 00:22:44,474
that is always under siege
from one quarter or another.

458
00:22:44,508 --> 00:22:46,119
You're telling me how
you're running around

459
00:22:46,143 --> 00:22:47,487
with your paramedic friend
helping some kid

460
00:22:47,511 --> 00:22:49,279
who's stealing drugs.

461
00:22:49,313 --> 00:22:52,449
While her husband buckles down
and keeps his eye on the prize.

462
00:22:52,483 --> 00:22:54,317
Captain Casey, what do you know.

463
00:22:54,351 --> 00:22:56,329
Casey's earned every good
thing that's ever come his way.

464
00:22:56,353 --> 00:22:59,589
It's not him I'm worried about.

465
00:22:59,623 --> 00:23:01,291
Where's this coming from?

466
00:23:01,325 --> 00:23:03,960
Look, I just thought you'd be
further along now, Kelly.

467
00:23:03,994 --> 00:23:05,729
You just... you had so much promise.

468
00:23:05,763 --> 00:23:06,996
Had?

469
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:10,767
Look, all I meant was that you...

470
00:23:10,801 --> 00:23:13,636
Hell,

471
00:23:13,671 --> 00:23:15,004
I didn't mean anything.

472
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,344
Damn, I gotta drop off
a deposit at the ballroom

473
00:23:21,378 --> 00:23:22,979
or we're gonna lose the place.

474
00:23:23,013 --> 00:23:24,524
- I'll get the tab.
- No, not on my watch.

475
00:23:24,548 --> 00:23:27,517
Grizz, I got it.

476
00:23:27,551 --> 00:23:28,685
Okay.

477
00:23:31,489 --> 00:23:34,023
I'll see you at the thing. I hope.

478
00:23:41,065 --> 00:23:42,599
Hey, Stella.

479
00:23:42,633 --> 00:23:44,768
Do you wanna go out and grab a dr...

480
00:23:44,802 --> 00:23:47,604
- Hey, Kelly.
- Yo.

481
00:23:47,638 --> 00:23:49,339
Well... you know Zach,

482
00:23:49,373 --> 00:23:52,041
he brought his Hazmat equipment
to the firehouse on Friday.

483
00:23:52,076 --> 00:23:55,218
Yeah, sure. How's it going?

484
00:23:55,243 --> 00:23:56,510
Great.

485
00:23:59,483 --> 00:24:02,118
Wwere you gonna ask me something?

486
00:24:02,153 --> 00:24:05,121
No, no, I was just, um...

487
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,561
Just stopped by to pick these up.

488
00:24:11,595 --> 00:24:14,664
Gonna meet some of the guys,
grab a smoke.

489
00:24:14,698 --> 00:24:15,713
Later.

490
00:24:15,738 --> 00:24:17,033
- Good to see you.
- Okay.

491
00:24:22,006 --> 00:24:24,040
Here you go.

492
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,300
The rehab place says he should be out

493
00:24:31,325 --> 00:24:33,611
as early as next week,
and since we're already on file

494
00:24:33,636 --> 00:24:35,580
with DCFS as approved guardians...

495
00:24:35,605 --> 00:24:38,440
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

496
00:24:38,474 --> 00:24:39,541
Why not?

497
00:24:39,576 --> 00:24:42,646
You'll need to reapply
as temporary foster parents

498
00:24:42,671 --> 00:24:43,880
for this specific case.

499
00:24:43,896 --> 00:24:45,397
And that can take some time.

500
00:24:45,431 --> 00:24:47,065
That's ridiculous.

501
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:49,434
I appreciate what
you're trying to do, but

502
00:24:49,468 --> 00:24:51,569
it's gonna be hard to try
to convince my boss

503
00:24:51,604 --> 00:24:54,939
to make special accommodations
for a kid who has

504
00:24:54,974 --> 00:24:57,776
caused the department so much grief.

505
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:02,968
They want her under supervision
in a staterun foster facility.

506
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:06,084
I mean, a...

507
00:25:06,118 --> 00:25:07,752
I said she could stay.

508
00:25:07,787 --> 00:25:10,722
Um...

509
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:12,891
I'm sorry,

510
00:25:12,925 --> 00:25:16,127
but ultimately, DCFS is responsible

511
00:25:16,162 --> 00:25:18,196
for keeping her safe.

512
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:24,135
The only place

513
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:26,471
Bria is guaranteed to be safe is...

514
00:25:26,505 --> 00:25:28,406
is with us.

515
00:25:28,441 --> 00:25:31,342
Because that's where she wants to be.

516
00:25:33,846 --> 00:25:36,915
After all we did for Louie...

517
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:38,550
All that we went through, I...

518
00:25:38,584 --> 00:25:40,985
I'm sure you can find a way
to get your boss

519
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,488
on board with this plan.

520
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,598
I'll do what I can.

521
00:26:07,613 --> 00:26:08,980
Hey, how's about this?

522
00:26:09,014 --> 00:26:11,182
Any firefighter that comes into Molly's

523
00:26:11,217 --> 00:26:14,152
gets a free shot glass
that says "Slamigan."

524
00:26:14,186 --> 00:26:15,520
Come on, it's good.

525
00:26:15,554 --> 00:26:18,623
Is it done?

526
00:26:18,657 --> 00:26:20,658
Give it a try.

527
00:26:28,534 --> 00:26:32,437
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Yeah, haha!

528
00:26:32,471 --> 00:26:33,805
As advertised.

529
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:35,206
Okay, all right, easy does it.

530
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:36,941
It's one thing to breach
a makebelieve door

531
00:26:36,976 --> 00:26:38,376
in a controlled environment.

532
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,545
It is another thing
to execute a forced entry

533
00:26:40,579 --> 00:26:42,213
in a realworld emergency.

534
00:26:42,248 --> 00:26:44,382
Would you pipe down?
Just let Cruz enjoy his moment.

535
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:46,851
Wow, okay, no need to get snippy.

536
00:26:46,886 --> 00:26:51,389
Slamigan!

537
00:26:51,423 --> 00:26:52,824
Muah!

538
00:26:55,194 --> 00:26:56,494
Missed a lot of school.

539
00:26:56,529 --> 00:26:57,996
Is there anyone we can contact

540
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,631
so you can catch up on your homework?

541
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:01,566
I was kind of hoping
being a homeless runaway

542
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,644
would get me out of homework.

543
00:27:02,668 --> 00:27:05,069
Nice try.

544
00:27:05,104 --> 00:27:06,971
Phone was ringing.

545
00:27:07,006 --> 00:27:09,073
Tina Cantrell's name popped up.

546
00:27:09,108 --> 00:27:11,543
Went to voicemail
before I could grab it.

547
00:27:14,613 --> 00:27:15,847
What'd she say?

548
00:27:15,881 --> 00:27:17,649
Listen.

549
00:27:17,683 --> 00:27:20,518
<i>Gabby, I wanted to let you
know that DCFS has approved</i>

550
00:27:20,553 --> 00:27:21,863
<i>you and Matt as temporary guardians...</i>

551
00:27:21,887 --> 00:27:25,256
My God.

552
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:27,269
- That's fantastic news.
<i>- Pick up the paperwork...</i>

553
00:27:27,293 --> 00:27:30,895
Hey, what's up?

554
00:27:32,264 --> 00:27:34,566
DCFS is gonna let Bria stay with us.

555
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,035
Hey, nice going.

556
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:39,003
It was Casey who made it happen.

557
00:27:40,973 --> 00:27:44,943
<i>Squad 3, structure fire,
1250 South Western.</i>

558
00:27:44,977 --> 00:27:47,779
- Hey, Kelly.
- Yeah?

559
00:27:47,813 --> 00:27:48,913
Thanks for everything.

560
00:27:48,948 --> 00:27:51,783
Yeah, of course.

561
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:22,814
- Better mask up.
- What's the story, Colannino?

562
00:28:22,848 --> 00:28:23,982
Some kind of chemicals

563
00:28:24,016 --> 00:28:25,650
burning inside the loading dock.

564
00:28:25,684 --> 00:28:28,119
Don't know what it is, but
I'm not taking my guys inside

565
00:28:28,153 --> 00:28:29,988
- till Hazmat gets here.
- All right.

566
00:28:30,022 --> 00:28:31,723
- Hey, mask up, guys.
- Copy that.

567
00:28:31,757 --> 00:28:34,125
- Any employees on site?
- Doesn't look like it.

568
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,994
The place is locked up tight.

569
00:28:36,028 --> 00:28:37,128
All right.

570
00:28:37,162 --> 00:28:38,663
We got an unknown chemical fire.

571
00:28:38,697 --> 00:28:40,131
Hazmat's en route.

572
00:28:40,165 --> 00:28:41,643
Let's get that door open
so they can get inside.

573
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:44,769
Copy that.

574
00:28:45,871 --> 00:28:47,272
Cut our way through?

575
00:28:47,306 --> 00:28:49,674
Yeah, these should be support lock pins.

576
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:50,975
We'll just sever 'em.

577
00:28:54,213 --> 00:28:57,348
Squad 3, stay clear of the windows.

578
00:28:59,285 --> 00:29:00,685
All right, everybody push back.

579
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:02,453
Colannino, establish a perimeter.

580
00:29:02,488 --> 00:29:04,022
There's no telling what's inside there

581
00:29:04,056 --> 00:29:06,691
- or how big it's gonna get.
- All right, copy that.

582
00:29:06,725 --> 00:29:08,660
We heard the blast. Everyone okay?

583
00:29:08,694 --> 00:29:10,194
Yeah, but we need to pull back.

584
00:29:10,229 --> 00:29:11,706
There's a fire inside the loading dock,

585
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,642
and whatever they have stored
in there is exploding.

586
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:15,366
55gallon drums of industrial cleaner.

587
00:29:15,401 --> 00:29:16,478
Fire must be causing them to BLEVE.

588
00:29:16,502 --> 00:29:17,869
You familiar with the place?

589
00:29:17,903 --> 00:29:19,514
Yeah, I've done Hazmat
inspections on the site.

590
00:29:19,538 --> 00:29:21,306
If the fire gets beyond
the loading dock,

591
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,707
it'll hit the mother lode inside;

592
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:24,574
50,000 gallons.

593
00:29:24,673 --> 00:29:26,907
It'll level the whole block.

594
00:29:28,465 --> 00:29:30,732
- Look, we gotta make a stand.
- Yeah, say no more.

595
00:29:30,767 --> 00:29:32,507
Hey, guys, we gotta get that door open.

596
00:29:32,532 --> 00:29:34,663
We need to contain
the fire at the loading dock.

597
00:29:34,688 --> 00:29:37,085
- Got the saw, Lieutenant.
- Yeah, Capp, you stay with me.

598
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,367
The rest of you guys, stay back.

599
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:46,980
Hey, give me as much room as you can.

600
00:29:47,005 --> 00:29:48,590
Copy.

601
00:29:58,284 --> 00:30:01,236
Hey! Let's keep at it.

602
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:06,463
If we don't contain this,

603
00:30:06,488 --> 00:30:08,949
we're gonna have to evacuate
a tenblock area.

604
00:30:20,921 --> 00:30:24,990
Okay, we're good.

605
00:30:25,025 --> 00:30:28,527
Capp, you see anything
start to flash, hit the ground.

606
00:30:28,562 --> 00:30:29,962
Copy.

607
00:30:32,802 --> 00:30:35,146
Whole place is hot.

608
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:38,903
Colannino, let's get
a line in here, quick.

609
00:30:38,975 --> 00:30:41,043
<i>Copy that, Squad 3.</i>

610
00:30:49,811 --> 00:30:51,691
Clear for Hazmat.

611
00:30:59,829 --> 00:31:02,398
The fire's inside.
We have to get in there.

612
00:31:02,432 --> 00:31:04,967
Yeah, just stay back, we'll get it open.

613
00:31:05,001 --> 00:31:06,747
Hey, Cruz, bring a sledge over here.

614
00:31:06,772 --> 00:31:08,137
We're gonna need to pop this door.

615
00:31:08,171 --> 00:31:11,053
Yeah, yeah, wait there
Lieutenant, I got this.

616
00:31:21,918 --> 00:31:23,152
What the hell is that?

617
00:31:23,186 --> 00:31:24,987
He calls it the Slamitagain.

618
00:31:25,021 --> 00:31:27,853
- The Slamigan.
- What?

619
00:31:38,101 --> 00:31:39,668
Cool.

620
00:31:39,702 --> 00:31:42,223
Hey 37, let's get in here.

621
00:31:42,472 --> 00:31:45,174
Hey, Cruz, nice work, bud.

622
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:50,179
Hey, isn't that thing heavy?

623
00:31:50,213 --> 00:31:51,847
Yes, it is.

624
00:32:02,058 --> 00:32:03,025
Man, how're we looking?

625
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:04,726
Danger's past.

626
00:32:04,761 --> 00:32:09,164
You and your guys are free
to get in there and mop it up.

627
00:32:12,402 --> 00:32:15,871
Worried there's some types
of commercial...

628
00:32:15,905 --> 00:32:16,905
Whoa!

629
00:32:17,974 --> 00:32:19,575
Gentlemen.

630
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:23,479
The Slamigan has been tested
in a realworld situation.

631
00:32:23,513 --> 00:32:25,914
A trial by fire, you might say.

632
00:32:25,949 --> 00:32:27,449
- And?
- It works.

633
00:32:27,484 --> 00:32:29,985
- Bam!
- We did it!

634
00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:31,787
You guys keep saying "we."

635
00:32:31,821 --> 00:32:34,256
Because I am gonna represent
you on this, Cruz.

636
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,258
I'm putting a call in
to Nick Porter right now.

637
00:32:36,292 --> 00:32:37,570
Hey, hey, no, no, no, no, no, no.

638
00:32:37,594 --> 00:32:39,094
You don't gotta get in touch

639
00:32:39,128 --> 00:32:40,762
with any of those pinheads from KW...

640
00:32:40,797 --> 00:32:43,232
Listen, we can market this
thing on our own, Cruz, okay?

641
00:32:43,266 --> 00:32:44,643
Don't give away any of this, you know,

642
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:46,401
action to this Nick Porter guy.

643
00:32:46,436 --> 00:32:48,403
Yeah, give it to
Christopher Herrmann instead.

644
00:32:48,438 --> 00:32:51,340
Wait... hey!
This is none of your concern.

645
00:32:51,374 --> 00:32:53,242
I got your back on this.

646
00:32:53,276 --> 00:32:55,077
Hey, Mouch.

647
00:32:55,111 --> 00:32:56,411
Hang up that phone.

648
00:32:56,446 --> 00:32:58,146
Nick Porter and those clowns

649
00:32:58,181 --> 00:32:59,915
are gonna have nothing to do with this!

650
00:32:59,949 --> 00:33:02,518
- Mouch!
- What?

651
00:33:02,552 --> 00:33:04,586
How long have you been
hiding your little secret?

652
00:33:04,621 --> 00:33:07,556
I worked on it
right in front of your face.

653
00:33:10,293 --> 00:33:14,096
She lives with us. Works with us.

654
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,797
You can't do this.

655
00:33:17,734 --> 00:33:19,434
Do what?

656
00:33:19,469 --> 00:33:21,970
You cannot be in love with Brett.

657
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,608
Yeah, says the guy
with the great girlfriend.

658
00:33:26,643 --> 00:33:28,844
Lily doesn't work here.
She's not our roommate.

659
00:33:28,878 --> 00:33:32,548
I'm not going to do anything
about it, Otis, okay?

660
00:33:32,582 --> 00:33:35,617
I know she doesn't feel the same way.

661
00:33:35,652 --> 00:33:36,896
Hey, Cruz, do you still wanna go

662
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,620
to the fundraiser together?

663
00:33:38,655 --> 00:33:41,023
'Cause I'm gonna go to the gym,
but I can be ready by 6:00.

664
00:33:41,057 --> 00:33:44,026
- Yeah, it's great.
- Okay.

665
00:33:48,164 --> 00:33:50,866
It's a disaster.

666
00:33:54,771 --> 00:33:56,148
I don't think we can make that dinner,

667
00:33:56,172 --> 00:33:57,573
but the 100 Club is the best.

668
00:33:57,607 --> 00:34:00,008
If I just send in my donation,

669
00:34:00,043 --> 00:34:01,053
is Chief Grissom gonna feel slighted?

670
00:34:01,077 --> 00:34:02,578
No, that's fine.

671
00:34:02,612 --> 00:34:05,514
And hey, great work getting
that DCFS situation sorted.

672
00:34:05,548 --> 00:34:08,584
- Bria must be happy.
- Yeah, thanks.

673
00:34:08,618 --> 00:34:11,253
Next hurdle is getting her in
to see her dad.

674
00:34:11,287 --> 00:34:14,022
Rehab facility has a policy
about no visitors

675
00:34:14,057 --> 00:34:15,334
during the last week of treatment.

676
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:17,159
We gotta make this happen.

677
00:34:17,193 --> 00:34:18,860
Cruz knows a nurse at the facility.

678
00:34:18,895 --> 00:34:21,396
Grew up with her. I'll put him on it.

679
00:34:21,431 --> 00:34:23,765
You make that happen,
I'll buy you a box of Cubans.

680
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,567
Deal, but we smoke 'em together.

681
00:34:25,602 --> 00:34:28,704
- It's been too long.
- Amen.

682
00:34:35,311 --> 00:34:37,879
Are you going to the fundraiser?

683
00:34:37,914 --> 00:34:40,382
Yeah.

684
00:34:40,416 --> 00:34:42,551
I just... I... I thought you
would've blown it off,

685
00:34:42,585 --> 00:34:44,252
the way Grizz got under your skin.

686
00:34:44,287 --> 00:34:46,888
No, I'm over it. You going too?

687
00:34:46,923 --> 00:34:48,123
No.

688
00:34:48,157 --> 00:34:50,692
I have a date. With Zach.

689
00:34:50,727 --> 00:34:52,260
- Hazmat Zach?
- Yeah.

690
00:34:52,295 --> 00:34:55,397
Wow, date number two.
You must like the guy.

691
00:34:55,431 --> 00:34:58,934
Tsk. I do, actually.

692
00:35:01,738 --> 00:35:05,540
This fundraiser, it's for a good cause.

693
00:35:05,575 --> 00:35:09,244
If you care about firefighters,
you might consider coming.

694
00:35:16,085 --> 00:35:19,154
It is a good cause.

695
00:35:19,188 --> 00:35:22,924
And I do care about firefighters.

696
00:35:28,131 --> 00:35:29,798
What do we got?

697
00:35:29,832 --> 00:35:33,235
The "bathing bouquet."
Mouch, really?

698
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:35,904
It's a charity auction.
I'm driving up the price.

699
00:35:35,938 --> 00:35:38,907
You bid $50 more than
the next highest bidder.

700
00:35:38,941 --> 00:35:40,776
You know,
if you really wanted the thing,

701
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,277
just say you're buying it for Trudy.

702
00:35:43,946 --> 00:35:45,347
Well...

703
00:35:45,381 --> 00:35:48,083
Well, don't you two
make a pretty picture.

704
00:35:48,117 --> 00:35:49,284
What're we bidding on?

705
00:35:49,318 --> 00:35:50,585
Ooh, bath crystals.

706
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:53,488
Keep your distance.

707
00:35:53,523 --> 00:35:56,425
So are you gonna get me a drink or what?

708
00:35:56,459 --> 00:35:58,927
- We just got here.
- Yeah, exactly.

709
00:35:58,961 --> 00:36:01,697
What is taking so long?

710
00:36:01,731 --> 00:36:03,765
Kelly.

711
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,201
Thought maybe you got lost
on your way here.

712
00:36:06,235 --> 00:36:07,769
Hey, you remember Stella?

713
00:36:07,804 --> 00:36:09,204
- Hi.
- Yeah, Stella.

714
00:36:09,238 --> 00:36:10,872
- How are you?
- Good. Good to see you.

715
00:36:10,907 --> 00:36:13,608
Um, I need to borrow Kelly
for just one moment.

716
00:36:13,643 --> 00:36:16,712
Yeah, he is all yours.
I'll get us those drinks.

717
00:36:16,746 --> 00:36:19,114
Deal.

718
00:36:19,148 --> 00:36:20,649
Is it serious?

719
00:36:20,683 --> 00:36:24,319
Nah, we just live together.

720
00:36:27,824 --> 00:36:32,160
Listen, if I was riding you
the other night, it's just...

721
00:36:32,195 --> 00:36:33,895
Well...

722
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:34,830
Look, the fact is, Kelly,

723
00:36:34,864 --> 00:36:37,833
I know that you are
the sharpest, toughest,

724
00:36:37,867 --> 00:36:40,669
gutsiest firefighter
this city's ever seen, ever.

725
00:36:40,703 --> 00:36:42,137
That's nice to hear.

726
00:36:42,171 --> 00:36:44,806
That's why I wanna introduce
you to some people.

727
00:36:44,841 --> 00:36:46,908
I got the deputy commissioner
over there.

728
00:36:46,943 --> 00:36:49,044
A whole swarm of highflyers
from Rahm's office.

729
00:36:49,078 --> 00:36:52,347
Just come over there and
thrill 'em with a story or two

730
00:36:52,381 --> 00:36:53,815
about crawling some hallway...

731
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:56,351
No, if all the same, I'd rather lay low.

732
00:36:56,385 --> 00:36:59,387
Grab a drink with my guys.

733
00:36:59,422 --> 00:37:00,722
You're part of my legacy, Kelly.

734
00:37:00,757 --> 00:37:02,557
You carry your father's name.

735
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,726
You might be content
riding out your career

736
00:37:04,761 --> 00:37:08,230
at that Squad table,
but that's not good enough.

737
00:37:08,264 --> 00:37:10,265
And if I can make things happen for you,

738
00:37:10,299 --> 00:37:12,567
you damn well better believe I will.

739
00:37:17,206 --> 00:37:19,174
Enjoy your drink.

740
00:37:23,379 --> 00:37:26,915
Tell Joe Cruz he owes me. Big time.

741
00:37:26,949 --> 00:37:28,550
Absolutely.

742
00:37:28,584 --> 00:37:30,685
Thanks again, Pilar.

743
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,189
- Big time.
- Understood.

744
00:37:34,223 --> 00:37:36,191
Why am I so nervous?

745
00:37:36,225 --> 00:37:39,694
It's just been a little while
since you saw him, that's all.

746
00:37:39,729 --> 00:37:41,630
All right, that's his room.

747
00:37:41,664 --> 00:37:45,497
You have about a half an hour
tops before shift change.

748
00:37:46,135 --> 00:37:48,552
Thank you.

749
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:04,386
Daddy?

750
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,887
Bria.

751
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:12,561
You look so good.

752
00:38:12,595 --> 00:38:14,262
My angel girl.

753
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,315
The way you stepped up with Tina

754
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:37,118
even when you didn't have to...

755
00:38:37,153 --> 00:38:39,354
Hell yes, I had to.

756
00:38:48,631 --> 00:38:50,532
I'm sorry if I got too consumed

757
00:38:50,566 --> 00:38:53,101
with all this at first.

758
00:38:53,135 --> 00:38:56,271
I wasn't gonna let this
go wrong for you or for Bria.

759
00:38:59,642 --> 00:39:03,111
I just needed you to know that...

760
00:39:07,416 --> 00:39:10,185
Know what?

761
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:13,989
Um, when that whole thing
with Louie went down,

762
00:39:14,023 --> 00:39:18,393
your first move was
to pull away from me.

763
00:39:18,427 --> 00:39:22,964
Decide to do it on your own.

764
00:39:22,999 --> 00:39:26,401
So when you started
getting in deep with Bria,

765
00:39:26,435 --> 00:39:30,071
I got this sinking feeling.

766
00:39:30,106 --> 00:39:33,708
Maybe we were going down that same road.

767
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,547
I'm sorry.

768
00:39:39,582 --> 00:39:41,683
Don't be.

769
00:39:45,688 --> 00:39:48,356
I just want you to know that

770
00:39:48,391 --> 00:39:51,593
wherever you're going,

771
00:39:51,627 --> 00:39:55,530
I'm right here with you.

772
00:39:55,564 --> 00:39:57,332
I know.

773
00:40:03,771 --> 00:40:08,771

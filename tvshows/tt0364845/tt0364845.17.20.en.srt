1
00:00:05,092 --> 00:00:07,746
Well, I tell you what,
it is good to be home.

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,748
Just got back to port
an hour ago,

3
00:00:09,792 --> 00:00:11,750
I've already got
my land legs back.

4
00:00:11,794 --> 00:00:13,752
Oh, I appreciate that,
Captain, but

5
00:00:13,796 --> 00:00:16,364
Gloria's makingher blue-ribbon lasagne tonight.

6
00:00:17,974 --> 00:00:19,149
Yep.

7
00:00:19,193 --> 00:00:21,021
Word is she even
baked a cherry pie,

8
00:00:21,064 --> 00:00:23,371
so maybe she missed me
as much as I missed her.

9
00:00:23,414 --> 00:00:25,373
You bet.
0800 tomorrow morning,

10
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,331
and we'll get right into...

11
00:00:29,507 --> 00:00:31,509
I got to call you back.

12
00:00:41,432 --> 00:00:43,043
Gloria?

13
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:49,397
Gloria?

14
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:00,277
Gloria?

15
00:01:09,678 --> 00:01:11,506
Gloria!

16
00:01:43,277 --> 00:01:44,930
Look, I...

17
00:01:44,974 --> 00:01:47,281
That's... Yes, that's-that's
what I've been trying to say

18
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:49,239
for the last five minutes, okay?

19
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:50,719
No.

20
00:01:50,762 --> 00:01:53,243
I cannot help you here, okay?

21
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:56,072
Just tell everyone, okay? Aunts, uncles, cousins,

22
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,379
just... stop calling me!

23
00:01:59,554 --> 00:02:01,251
Damn, that was harsh.Yeah.

24
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:03,862
If I talked to my familylike that, my mom would kill me.

25
00:02:03,906 --> 00:02:05,473
Yeah, it wasn't family.

26
00:02:05,516 --> 00:02:07,059
Some guy, I don't even know him. Why is he
calling you?

27
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,389
Because peopledon't proofread.

28
00:02:08,432 --> 00:02:09,955
See, last night,

29
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:12,001
Aunt Lupe Garcia of Falls Church

30
00:02:12,044 --> 00:02:15,352
decided to send an invite
to her entire enormous family

31
00:02:15,396 --> 00:02:18,442
to Uncle Roland'spotluck birthday fiesta,

32
00:02:18,486 --> 00:02:21,793
and she accidentally
mistyped the RSVP number.

33
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:24,361
So now I have every Garciaand their mother

34
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:25,817
calling to tell me
who they're bringing

35
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:27,190
and what dish. Well, okay,

36
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:29,081
next time someone calls you,
you should just ask them

37
00:02:29,105 --> 00:02:30,454
to send out a corrected e-mail.

38
00:02:30,498 --> 00:02:33,065
Aunt Lupe is the only one
with the list, okay?

39
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:35,416
She BCC'd everyone else,

40
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:37,069
and I can't get a hold
of Aunt Lupe.

41
00:02:37,113 --> 00:02:39,463
Oh, come on.

42
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:40,899
McGee.

43
00:02:40,943 --> 00:02:43,424
You have the wrong number.

44
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:45,469
I can't live like this.

45
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:47,471
Torres eat your yogurt again?

46
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:49,473
Uh, no, boss. I keep getting these calls...

47
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:50,518
Grab your gear.

48
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:51,693
Uh, we got a dead body?

49
00:02:51,736 --> 00:02:53,738
I don't know what we got.

50
00:02:56,263 --> 00:02:58,221
Oh, got to be kidding me.

51
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:03,333
Well, if you talk to her, please have her call me

52
00:03:03,357 --> 00:03:04,880
at once?
Thank you.

53
00:03:04,923 --> 00:03:07,448
The gentleman on the phone
is Admiral Michael Caplinger.

54
00:03:07,491 --> 00:03:09,580
He's head
of the Fleet Forces Command.

55
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:12,235
He just got backfrom a major-level exercise,

56
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,715
45 days at sea.

57
00:03:13,758 --> 00:03:15,934
Abductee is his wife Gloria.

58
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:18,546
She was last seen at a speaking
engagement last night.

59
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:20,678
Her purse and keys
are missing, but the car's

60
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:22,724
in the garage. Nothing on the
intruder so far

61
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:24,378
other than the broken
glass, obviously,

62
00:03:24,421 --> 00:03:25,901
when they broke in.

63
00:03:25,944 --> 00:03:27,032
Hey, Gibbs?

64
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:28,512
Canvass the area. Find a witness.

65
00:03:28,556 --> 00:03:30,166
What do you got, Bishop?

66
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,560
Well, it looks like therewas some sort of scuffle.

67
00:03:32,603 --> 00:03:35,432
Stool's tipped over,
there's blood on the floor,

68
00:03:35,476 --> 00:03:38,261
and the back door was open.

69
00:03:38,305 --> 00:03:41,395
So, Gibbs, if the intruder
forced Gloria out the door,

70
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:43,135
it's possible that
she was incapacitated.

71
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:44,180
Gloria?

72
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,355
I've got her.

73
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:46,748
I've got her on the phone.

74
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,402
Where is she? Hold on, honey.

75
00:03:48,445 --> 00:03:49,770
She's with a friend. She didn't realize

76
00:03:49,794 --> 00:03:51,361
she had her phone offfrom last night,

77
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:53,537
but she's okay, she's okay.

78
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:54,930
No, honey, I'm fine.

79
00:03:54,973 --> 00:03:58,542
So... if thatwasn't Gloria's blood,

80
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:00,544
whose was it?

81
00:04:00,588 --> 00:04:02,677
Door's open.

82
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:05,506
And there's a note.

83
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:12,687
"I took it!"

84
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,471
Took what?

85
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:15,907
Admiral.

86
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:18,345
What kind of burglarleaves a note?

87
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,869
What is it?

88
00:04:20,912 --> 00:04:22,566
There anything missing in there?

89
00:04:24,873 --> 00:04:26,483
Yeah.

90
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:28,485
It's a Purple Heart.

91
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:30,182
My daughter's.

92
00:04:30,226 --> 00:04:32,576
Are you telling mewhoever broke in here

93
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,317
stole thatand left everything else?

94
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:36,406
That doesn't make any sense.

95
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,453
Gibbs, there's some writingon the back of this.

96
00:04:39,496 --> 00:04:41,455
"Stargazer Motel.
Room eight.

97
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:43,326
I'll be waiting."

98
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,634
What is that...
Some kind of threat?

99
00:04:55,556 --> 00:04:58,167
NCIS.
Come out slowly,

100
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,648
your handson top of your head.

101
00:05:09,657 --> 00:05:11,615
Sir, we have reasonto believe that you...

102
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:13,617
You bet your ass I did.

103
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:16,620
Name's Joseph Smith.
Write it down.

104
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:18,840
I broke intothe admiral's house,

105
00:05:18,883 --> 00:05:20,537
stole the Purple Heart,

106
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:23,671
the whole shebang.

107
00:05:29,154 --> 00:05:30,634
Uh, Gibbs?

108
00:05:30,678 --> 00:05:32,636
You want me to grab him? I don't think

109
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,246
he's gonna outrun you, Nick.

110
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,552
Let's go, people.

111
00:05:35,596 --> 00:05:37,206
Get the cuffs.

112
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:38,773
Haul me out.

113
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:41,645
Mr. Smith, hold on a second.

114
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:44,213
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

115
00:05:44,256 --> 00:05:45,910
I bet you would.
You'd like to know

116
00:05:45,954 --> 00:05:48,304
where your Purple Heart is,
don't you?

117
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,654
Well, I'm not gonna
say a damn thing

118
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:52,700
till I get a root beer.

119
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,062
Gibbs, you know the admiral.

120
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:08,280
This is his wife Gloria.

121
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:10,500
Ma'am. Gibbs, the Caplingers

122
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:12,546
have asked
for a moment of our time.

123
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:14,809
We wanted to talk to you
about the Purple Heart.

124
00:06:14,852 --> 00:06:16,550
It was awardedto our daughter.

125
00:06:16,593 --> 00:06:17,812
Her name was Julia.

126
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,901
She was a first lieutenantin the Marines.

127
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:21,946
She was finishing up
her last week

128
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,905
in Afghanistan...

129
00:06:23,948 --> 00:06:25,994
and she wason a patrol convoy...

130
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,520
Lead vehicle was
hit with an IED.

131
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:32,609
Julia went to assistthe wounded.

132
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:35,699
Second IED detonated.

133
00:06:35,743 --> 00:06:37,614
We're sorry for your loss.

134
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:38,963
Admiral, Mrs. Caplinger,

135
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:40,487
know that we hear you.

136
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,618
And if all else fails,

137
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:43,446
a replacement medal
will be issued.

138
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,882
I'll see to it myself.

139
00:06:44,926 --> 00:06:46,493
Afraid it's not quite that easy.

140
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:48,669
My father wasan admiral, too,

141
00:06:48,712 --> 00:06:50,540
but the job that he
took the most pride in

142
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:52,673
was being a
grandfather to Julia.

143
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:55,763
He engraved a message on the
back of that medal by hand,

144
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:58,766
and he passed away
two months after she did. Director Vance,

145
00:06:58,809 --> 00:07:00,855
that Purple Heart, it's...

146
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:02,770
it's irreplaceable.

147
00:07:02,813 --> 00:07:03,771
We'll get it back.

148
00:07:03,814 --> 00:07:04,772
We already have

149
00:07:04,815 --> 00:07:06,382
the intruder in custody.

150
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,428
So you have a location
on the medal?

151
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:10,386
Uh, no. Well, what's the holdup?

152
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,040
Suspect's 95.I don't
understand...

153
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,650
Is that code for something?

154
00:07:13,694 --> 00:07:14,869
No, it's his age, ma'am.

155
00:07:14,912 --> 00:07:16,871
Are you telling me
that a 95-year-old man

156
00:07:16,914 --> 00:07:19,482
broke the leaded glass
on my front door? Yes, sir.

157
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:21,702
He's old, but he's not
done kickin' yet.

158
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:23,094
He's smarter than a whip.

159
00:07:23,138 --> 00:07:25,183
He's also a pain in the ass.

160
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:26,663
Meaning what, exactly?

161
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:29,057
Well, he demanded a root beer
before he talked.

162
00:07:37,718 --> 00:07:38,893
Um...

163
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:41,852
Mmm.

164
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:43,637
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

165
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,334
Mr. Smith,

166
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:47,641
how-how did you get cut?

167
00:07:47,684 --> 00:07:50,426
If you're gonna talk to me...

168
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,036
call me Joe.

169
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,517
Okay.
How'd you get hurt, Joe?

170
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:55,910
I tripped

171
00:07:55,953 --> 00:07:57,694
on a stool.

172
00:07:57,738 --> 00:07:59,957
The admiral needs to read a book

173
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:01,219
on feng shui.

174
00:08:01,263 --> 00:08:02,699
Where's the Purple Heart?

175
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:04,440
I'll tell you what,

176
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,311
you answer my questions,

177
00:08:06,355 --> 00:08:08,575
and then I'll answer
your questions.

178
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:14,189
What do you know
about World War II?

179
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:16,539
1939

180
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:17,758
to '45.

181
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:19,803
Uh, the Axis powers versus

182
00:08:19,847 --> 00:08:21,109
the Allies.

183
00:08:21,152 --> 00:08:22,632
You.

184
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:24,721
What was the date

185
00:08:24,765 --> 00:08:26,636
of the attack on Pearl Harbor?

186
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:29,117
Uh...

187
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,118
Too slow.

188
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:31,641
You.

189
00:08:31,685 --> 00:08:33,643
How many casualties

190
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:35,602
on the U.S.S. Arizona?

191
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:37,255
I...

192
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,257
know it was a lot.

193
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:41,608
Eighty?

194
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:43,044
Huh? 800?

195
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:45,568
How many people died...

196
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:49,703
on the U.S.S. Arizona?

197
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,227
Uh, I...

198
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,142
I-I actually don't know.

199
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:56,144
And you two work for the Navy?

200
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:58,929
You're a disgrace, both of you.

201
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:00,801
Get me the guy in charge.

202
00:09:00,844 --> 00:09:02,019
I'm wasting my time

203
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:04,108
talking to you two clowns. Okay,

204
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:05,719
let's take it down a notch. Get that

205
00:09:05,762 --> 00:09:07,372
gray-haired leatherneck.

206
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,678
Or I'm gonna

207
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:09,897
say...

208
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,202
"lawyer."

209
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,118
McGEE:
Listen, sir...

210
00:09:14,162 --> 00:09:15,598
Okay.

211
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:17,861
Uncle Frank,
you have the wrong number.

212
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:21,735
Oh, and, uh, by the way,
don't bring guacamole,

213
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:23,650
because cousin Maria's
already bringing some.

214
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:25,652
Yeah.
With the good chips.

215
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:27,697
You're welcome.

216
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:28,655
Hey, boss.

217
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:30,308
What do we know?

218
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:32,136
Oh, Joseph Smith.

219
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,617
About all he had on him
was his license.

220
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:35,942
No vehicle registered
to his name.

221
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:37,751
And he didn't have a carat the motel.

222
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:39,753
So he might have been on foot...

223
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,717
You gonna get that?

224
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:49,589
Nah. I'll let it go
to voice mail.

225
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:52,504
Where's the Purple Heart, McGee? Boss, we searched

226
00:09:52,548 --> 00:09:54,681
that motel top to bottom,
we didn't find a thing.

227
00:09:54,724 --> 00:09:55,812
What about his house?

228
00:09:55,856 --> 00:09:57,553
Uh, address on his
license is old.

229
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,903
We haven't been able to track
down a current residence.

230
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:02,210
There's a ton of Joseph
Smiths in the area.

231
00:10:02,253 --> 00:10:04,168
It's also possible he's
living with a relative.

232
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:07,563
So, long story short, we don't
know where the Purple Heart is.

233
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,913
Did you get the guyhis root beer and just ask him?

234
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:12,133
Hey, Gibbs. We need your help.

235
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:14,657
Joe gave us a quiz,
and we failed.

236
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:16,572
Did he tell you
where the medal is or not?

237
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,182
Not.
He said that

238
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:20,837
we were a disgrace to the Navy.

239
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:23,274
Gibbs, he only wantsto talk to you.

240
00:10:26,364 --> 00:10:29,019
Agent Gibbs... Omar, don't talk to me now.

241
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:39,726
Got a place for empties?

242
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:42,424
I've got a grievingfamily upstairs.

243
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:44,600
One way or another, that Purple Heart

244
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,950
is going back to them.

245
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:48,648
Where is it?

246
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,780
What do you know about war?

247
00:10:50,824 --> 00:10:53,174
Look, you gotyour root beer.

248
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:55,176
You got me.

249
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:56,699
Time to talk.

250
00:10:56,743 --> 00:10:58,222
It ain't about

251
00:10:58,266 --> 00:11:00,311
a fizzy drink.

252
00:11:00,355 --> 00:11:01,878
It's about

253
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:04,446
getting someone with perspective

254
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:06,013
to set it down,

255
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:08,319
to sit down in front of me...

256
00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:10,365
and listen.

257
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:24,031
What do you knowabout war, son?

258
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:27,338
Enough to know
I don't want to go back. Well, I do.

259
00:11:27,382 --> 00:11:31,125
December 7, 1941.

260
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:33,562
Attack on Pearl Harbor.

261
00:11:33,605 --> 00:11:37,348
I was on the USS Arizona.

262
00:11:37,392 --> 00:11:39,960
When I die,

263
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:41,962
I want my ashes

264
00:11:42,005 --> 00:11:43,964
interred on that ship.

265
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:46,749
Any survivor of the Arizona
has the right

266
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:47,924
to be laid to rest there.

267
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:50,710
Yeah. Well...

268
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:53,756
February '41,

269
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,063
I enlisted in the Navy.

270
00:11:56,106 --> 00:11:57,586
If you do the math...

271
00:11:57,629 --> 00:11:58,892
You were too young.I...

272
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:01,068
was only 16.

273
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:03,461
I had an older brother.

274
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:05,855
Henry Smith was his name.

275
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:09,729
I used his birth certificateto join.

276
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:12,949
I served under his name.

277
00:12:14,864 --> 00:12:17,780
But I'm telling you, I served.

278
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:19,869
Have to confirm that.

279
00:12:19,913 --> 00:12:21,871
It'll take time.

280
00:12:21,915 --> 00:12:24,308
Red tape means years.

281
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:26,920
I'm 95 years old.

282
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:31,489
I read an article about

283
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:33,709
Admiral Caplinger.

284
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,189
Said he used to be

285
00:12:35,232 --> 00:12:37,800
commanderof the Pacific Fleet.

286
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:40,020
He attended every interment

287
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,631
on the USS Arizona

288
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:44,198
when he was out there.

289
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:46,026
That means

290
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:48,811
he's got connections.

291
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:52,119
He's got perspective.

292
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:54,034
So, I wrote him,

293
00:12:54,077 --> 00:12:56,819
asked him for his help.

294
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:58,865
Three letters.

295
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:01,998
He never answered any of them.

296
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:03,565
He was at sea.

297
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:05,741
I want it from the admiral
in writing,

298
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,961
with his signature,

299
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:11,834
saying my ashes will be interred

300
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:13,836
on that ship.

301
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,621
Once I have that, I'll give him back

302
00:13:16,665 --> 00:13:18,798
his Purple Heart.

303
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:19,881
It's not the way to do it.

304
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,932
You see that?

305
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:24,760
I'm telling you,

306
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,023
I was on the Arizona

307
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:28,938
when those bombs hit.

308
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:31,245
And I want his word

309
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:33,638
that I'll be laid to rest there.

310
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:35,684
Blackmail is not the way
to get it done.

311
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:38,078
I tried to do it the right way.

312
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:40,515
Now I'm doing it my way.

313
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:53,963
On the morning
of December 7, 1941,

314
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:56,357
the Japanese
launched a surprise attack

315
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,664
on the U.S. Naval base
at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

316
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,972
Now, 15 minutes in,
a Kate attack plane dropped

317
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:05,757
an 800-kilogram bomb
onto the USS Arizona.

318
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:09,109
It ignited a million pounds
of gunpowder

319
00:14:09,152 --> 00:14:12,939
in a cataclysmic explosion
that tore the ship apart

320
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:15,289
and sunk it. TORRES:
Over 2,400

321
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:17,900
Americans diedin the attack of Pearl Harbor.

322
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:21,773
And almost half were
crewmen aboard the Arizona.

323
00:14:21,817 --> 00:14:25,125
I started looking stuff up, too, after Joe shamed us.

324
00:14:25,168 --> 00:14:27,475
Hmm. Well, this

325
00:14:27,518 --> 00:14:31,261
is the USS Arizona
Memorial in Pearl Harbor.

326
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:32,499
That's where Joe
wants to be buried?

327
00:14:32,523 --> 00:14:33,785
Yeah, the wreckage of the ship

328
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:35,091
is still underwater.

329
00:14:35,135 --> 00:14:36,963
And any survivorof the Arizona

330
00:14:37,006 --> 00:14:39,095
can have their ashes
placed within the ship,

331
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:40,836
among their fallen comrades.

332
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,098
Where are we with Joe Smith?

333
00:14:42,142 --> 00:14:43,317
Well, the math checks out.

334
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,797
Yeah, Joe, uh, turned 16 in January

335
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:47,625
of 1941, and there is a record

336
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:50,150
of a Henry Smith
having enlisted in the Navy

337
00:14:50,193 --> 00:14:52,935
in February of '41
at the age of 18.

338
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:56,112
He served as an electrician's
mate aboard the Arizona.

339
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:58,767
That was Joe, serving
under his brother's name.

340
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,074
Well, actually, we're not sure
which one of them that is.

341
00:15:01,117 --> 00:15:02,989
The rest of the service records

342
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:05,469
for Henry Smith
were lost in the war.

343
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:09,082
Got a picture of the brother? No. Joe said he wasn't
big into pictures.

344
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,084
He wasn't big on his
brother, either. They were

345
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:13,086
estranged,
and brother Henry died

346
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:15,392
in a car accident
at the age of 30.

347
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:17,481
Well, put Joe's picture up.

348
00:15:19,135 --> 00:15:20,963
That him or not?

349
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:23,487
Well, the bone structure
is similar,

350
00:15:23,531 --> 00:15:27,100
but it's impossible to say
for sure if that's Joe.

351
00:15:27,143 --> 00:15:29,145
Almost done here, Joe.

352
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:30,538
Well, make it quick.

353
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:33,976
I didn't sign up to be prodded like a 4-H hog.

354
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,325
Um, you should be happy

355
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:36,979
that we're trying
to help you out at all.

356
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:39,851
I didn't askfor a nanny up my ass, either.

357
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:41,505
Actually, you did.
See, when you confess

358
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:43,638
to a crime,
you earn yourself an escort.

359
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:45,031
What's his problem?

360
00:15:45,074 --> 00:15:46,747
Oh, he's been getting
some annoying phone calls.

361
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:48,643
He's usually way more
pleasant than this.

362
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:50,514
Hey. I mean, uh...

363
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:53,474
Well, at any rate, uh,

364
00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:55,911
Joe, your scars are consistent
with third-degree burns

365
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,348
that occurred a significant
amount of time ago.

366
00:15:58,392 --> 00:16:00,350
And the majority
of Arizonasurvivors

367
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:02,787
did suffer burns from the fires.

368
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:04,137
There you go.

369
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,661
I like this kid.

370
00:16:06,704 --> 00:16:08,204
I was also ableto dig up your brother's

371
00:16:08,228 --> 00:16:10,839
1953 autopsy report.

372
00:16:10,882 --> 00:16:13,015
It says that
he was killed instantly

373
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:16,192
when his head hit
the car windshield, and...

374
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:20,544
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

375
00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:22,416
Idiot had a few in him.

376
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:24,853
Got what was coming to him.

377
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:27,334
Well, bottom line, there's no mention

378
00:16:27,377 --> 00:16:31,207
of any previous scarsor injuries on Henry's body.

379
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:33,035
Ah.

380
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:35,168
Thank you, my friend.

381
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:36,647
Thank you.

382
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:38,364
Wait a second. That
doesn't prove anything.

383
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:40,477
The explosion on the Arizona
threw some men overboard

384
00:16:40,521 --> 00:16:42,044
that weren't burned at all.

385
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:44,133
What do you call that?

386
00:16:44,177 --> 00:16:46,048
A rug burn?

387
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:49,051
Wait.

388
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:51,488
Where are you going? Joe...
Where is he going?

389
00:16:52,924 --> 00:16:56,058
Joe? Joe, listen to me.

390
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:57,712
I want to believe you, okay?

391
00:16:57,755 --> 00:17:00,062
We all want
to believe you.Yeah.

392
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:02,760
Then tell the admiralto pull a few strings.

393
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:06,590
No, Admiral Caplinger has no
real power in this situation.

394
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:08,027
This all comes
down to us proving

395
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,091
that you were on that ship.

396
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:10,594
So the best thing
for you to do is

397
00:17:10,638 --> 00:17:12,161
tell us where the
Purple Heart is.

398
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:14,990
Then we can release you
and we can focus on the case.

399
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,992
Nah.

400
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,560
I'm not falling for that.

401
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:21,388
What? I know the drill.

402
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:23,477
Old people get conned

403
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,306
and then tossed aside.

404
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:29,135
Joe. Joe?

405
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:33,139
The medal stayswhere it is as...

406
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,097
What do you call 'em?

407
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:36,925
What?

408
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:39,319
Leverage. Where are you even
going right now?

409
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:42,278
You realize that you're not
in charge here, right?

410
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:47,196
Okay, fine.
You're in charge.

411
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,218
You have all the leverage.
Is that what you want to hear?

412
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:51,505
I want to hear that you got some DNA proof

413
00:17:51,548 --> 00:17:53,376
that I was on the Arizona.

414
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,987
I was in the hospitalwith my burn right after.

415
00:17:56,031 --> 00:17:58,642
Track down some old jarwith a skin sample.

416
00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:00,514
I know how it works.

417
00:18:00,557 --> 00:18:02,603
I watched CSI.

418
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:04,518
Actually, our best bet
at proving it is

419
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:06,563
for you to tell us
everything you can remember

420
00:18:06,607 --> 00:18:07,956
about the attack.

421
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,393
I don't think so. Look, we're out of leads here.

422
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:12,265
Okay? So any detail
that you can remember

423
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:14,397
about that day...
It could lead us... I told you,

424
00:18:14,441 --> 00:18:16,027
I'm not talking about it. I thought you wanted

425
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:18,140
someone to sit down
in front of you and listen.

426
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:19,576
I've said my piece.

427
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,143
Now I'm done talking.

428
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:22,666
Go get the DNA

429
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,278
and be grumpy some place else.

430
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:28,150
Life's too short
to get all out of shape

431
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:31,806
over crap phone calls,
you schmuck.

432
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:38,987
At home

433
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,381
in the middle of a workday? What you up to?

434
00:18:41,424 --> 00:18:43,383
Well, I'm working.

435
00:18:43,426 --> 00:18:45,385
Okay.

436
00:18:45,428 --> 00:18:47,343
Uh, listen, I looked
at the recordings

437
00:18:47,387 --> 00:18:49,606
from Interrogation.

438
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,131
From what I can tell,
Joe is hiding something.

439
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:55,003
Jack, that's who these guys are. They hide everything.

440
00:18:55,046 --> 00:18:56,613
And by "these guys," you mean

441
00:18:56,657 --> 00:18:59,790
World War II vets like your dad?

442
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:01,227
What do you got?

443
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,620
Kasie tracked down
a surveillance camera

444
00:19:03,664 --> 00:19:05,622
outside of the motel.

445
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,147
Joe wasn't traveling
on foot after all.

446
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,670
You find the cab?

447
00:19:09,713 --> 00:19:11,106
Bishop's working on it.

448
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,030
Good chance that the cabbie
might know something

449
00:19:13,064 --> 00:19:14,849
about what Joe did
with the Purple Heart.

450
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:18,113
In order to find the medal,

451
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,507
we got to get Joe to talk. Ah!

452
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,683
To prove he wason the Arizona,

453
00:19:22,726 --> 00:19:24,685
we got to get Joe to talk.

454
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:28,123
Huh. And according to McGee...

455
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,128
Joe refuses to speak at all now.

456
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,652
He thinks we can prove
his story with DNA.

457
00:19:35,696 --> 00:19:37,524
Yeah, so I heard.

458
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:40,962
Two things get my dad talk.

459
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:46,707
This is one of 'em.

460
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,752
A slide projector?

461
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:52,365
Something about watching
memories in a dark room

462
00:19:52,408 --> 00:19:53,975
makes one feel safe, maybe?

463
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:56,195
Oh, yeah.

464
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:58,762
And what was the other thing
that got your dad talking?

465
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:03,071
Having a job to do.

466
00:20:03,114 --> 00:20:04,551
Hmm.

467
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:10,513
Appreciate the help.Mm.

468
00:20:10,557 --> 00:20:12,950
You know, figured you being
an electrician and all.

469
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:14,735
We got time to kill.

470
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:16,954
DNA doesn't work as fast

471
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:20,001
they make it seem on TV.

472
00:20:20,044 --> 00:20:23,134
You doing some kind
of slide show for the family?

473
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:26,703
No. I wanted to fix
it for a friend.

474
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:28,705
I was never bigon pictures.

475
00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:32,709
My mom had a fewl was supposed to end up with,

476
00:20:32,753 --> 00:20:36,583
but she sent me to live with my uncle.

477
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:39,107
My brother was supposedto pick me up.

478
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,717
He didn't.

479
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:43,720
So, that's the end of that.

480
00:20:43,764 --> 00:20:46,593
Ah.

481
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:50,553
You're looking at me

482
00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:53,730
like I spent 95 years without...

483
00:20:53,774 --> 00:20:55,341
Hmm?

484
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:02,043
I knew... love.

485
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:05,133
I did.

486
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:08,876
It just never, ever lasts, does it?

487
00:21:14,664 --> 00:21:16,666
Ah.

488
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,717
Hey.Uh.

489
00:21:25,762 --> 00:21:27,764
I did it!

490
00:21:27,808 --> 00:21:30,289
I still got it.

491
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:42,518
You said you were

492
00:21:42,562 --> 00:21:44,781
doing this for a friend. I am.

493
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:46,740
I'm not your friend.

494
00:21:46,783 --> 00:21:48,263
What is this?

495
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,134
Some kind of trick

496
00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:52,267
to make me talk about it?

497
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,792
I told you to do your DNA thing.

498
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:57,794
Joe, we got nothing.

499
00:21:57,838 --> 00:21:59,796
We need something to go on here. The things

500
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,017
I saw that day shouldn't comeout of anyone's mouth.

501
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,193
You've seen war.

502
00:22:05,236 --> 00:22:07,021
How many people

503
00:22:07,064 --> 00:22:09,545
did you tellabout the worst of it?

504
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:11,242
Hey.

505
00:22:11,286 --> 00:22:13,549
If it was so bad,

506
00:22:13,593 --> 00:22:15,638
why do you want to
be buried there?

507
00:22:15,682 --> 00:22:19,860
Why are you asking me questionsyou know the answers to?

508
00:22:21,905 --> 00:22:23,907
Just leave me alone.

509
00:22:41,534 --> 00:22:43,013
What are we doing here?

510
00:22:43,057 --> 00:22:45,494
Seriously?
I just told you.

511
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:46,974
Oh, yeah. I
wasn't listening.

512
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:49,324
I was reading about
Pearl Harbor on my phone.

513
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,892
If that dude's gonna quiz me
again, I'm gonna be ready.

514
00:22:51,935 --> 00:22:54,851
Well, the guy who dropped
off Joe at the motel drives

515
00:22:54,895 --> 00:22:56,810
cab number 6234.

516
00:22:56,853 --> 00:22:58,855
Name is Kevin Deacon.

517
00:22:58,899 --> 00:23:00,161
Uh, excuse me.

518
00:23:00,204 --> 00:23:02,076
We're lookingfor a driver named Kevin Deacon.

519
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:05,079
Yeah. Second cab is his.

520
00:23:05,122 --> 00:23:06,535
He went around the corner
to get some coffee.

521
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,516
Should be right back.

522
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,213
Thank you.

523
00:23:13,783 --> 00:23:16,003
McGee.

524
00:23:16,046 --> 00:23:17,396
Aunt Lupe.

525
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:18,527
Oh, thank God you called.

526
00:23:18,571 --> 00:23:20,529
Uh, I-I've been waiting...

527
00:23:20,573 --> 00:23:23,314
Ooh. No hablo español.

528
00:23:23,358 --> 00:23:26,187
Uh... uno momento.

529
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,972
Tell her to send out the rightRSVP number to everyone.

530
00:23:29,016 --> 00:23:30,104
Okay.

531
00:23:30,147 --> 00:23:32,541
Aló?

532
00:23:32,585 --> 00:23:33,890
Sí.

533
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:36,110
No, no, no, no, es su amigo.

534
00:23:36,153 --> 00:23:38,155
Ah, qué bonito.Okay.

535
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:40,331
Okay, muy bien.

536
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:43,726
El estará allí.

537
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,032
Gracias.

538
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:47,774
Be there at 6:00. You're
bringing the enchiladas.

539
00:23:47,817 --> 00:23:48,992
Wait, what?

540
00:23:49,036 --> 00:23:50,187
Yeah, she felt so bad
about the trouble

541
00:23:50,211 --> 00:23:52,779
that, uh, she invited
you to the party.

542
00:23:52,822 --> 00:23:55,869
It'd be so rude to not
show up for Tía Lupe.

543
00:23:58,654 --> 00:24:00,134
That's our guy.

544
00:24:01,135 --> 00:24:03,529
Hey, uh, Kevin Deacon?

545
00:24:04,573 --> 00:24:06,096
Yeah.

546
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,056
NCIS. You dropped offa fare this morning

547
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:10,840
at the Stargazer Motel?

548
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:15,497
Someone needs to move this cab.

549
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,101
Hey, you got to get this
out of the way!

550
00:24:27,553 --> 00:24:29,468
Yes, sir, understood.

551
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:30,947
Admiral Caplinger.

552
00:24:30,991 --> 00:24:33,036
He's done playing
the old man's games.

553
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,777
He wants to press charges.

554
00:24:34,821 --> 00:24:36,276
We got a lot of loose ends
around here.

555
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,912
Cabbie. He ran.
We don't know why.

556
00:24:38,955 --> 00:24:40,261
Actually, I have an idea.

557
00:24:40,304 --> 00:24:41,262
Seems that Mr. Deacon

558
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:43,090
has a rap sheet a mile long

559
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:44,178
for fraud.Yeah.

560
00:24:44,221 --> 00:24:45,745
So? Gibbs, I know

561
00:24:45,788 --> 00:24:47,137
that you believe Joe.

562
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:48,922
I know that you respect him.

563
00:24:48,965 --> 00:24:50,967
But we have to consider
the alternative.

564
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:52,534
You think he's lying. Look,

565
00:24:52,578 --> 00:24:54,884
the cabbie ran as soon as he
knew we were there about Joe.

566
00:24:54,928 --> 00:24:56,407
This could all be
some sort of a con.

567
00:24:56,451 --> 00:24:58,671
Could be Joe refuses
to talk about Pearl Harbor

568
00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:00,150
because he wasn't there.

569
00:25:00,194 --> 00:25:01,761
Because his brotherwas the one

570
00:25:01,804 --> 00:25:03,110
who served and not him.No.

571
00:25:03,153 --> 00:25:04,827
I'm not buying it.
Why would he lie about that?

572
00:25:04,851 --> 00:25:05,982
Stolen valor?

573
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:07,636
I-It happens all the time.

574
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,203
Joe and his brother
were estranged.

575
00:25:09,246 --> 00:25:11,292
This could be
Joe's final victory

576
00:25:11,335 --> 00:25:12,859
in his family beef.

577
00:25:12,902 --> 00:25:14,774
Or who knows? It could befor financial gain.

578
00:25:14,817 --> 00:25:16,210
What the hell
are you doing, Jack?

579
00:25:16,253 --> 00:25:17,864
What am I doing?
What are youdoing?

580
00:25:17,907 --> 00:25:19,256
Gibbs,

581
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,700
take a look at what's
in front of us

582
00:25:20,736 --> 00:25:22,999
and tell me what we're doing
for the victims here.

583
00:25:23,043 --> 00:25:24,392
I want you to charge

584
00:25:24,435 --> 00:25:26,481
Joe Smith with theft,
breaking and entering

585
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,266
and obstruction of justice. I'm not doing that, Leon.

586
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,573
He's not lying.

587
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:34,271
You cannot ask me
to walk in there

588
00:25:34,315 --> 00:25:36,883
and tell him
that we've given up on him.Gibbs.

589
00:25:36,926 --> 00:25:38,275
Just because
you knew your father

590
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:40,539
does not mean you know Joe.

591
00:25:53,377 --> 00:25:55,379
I said to leave me be.

592
00:25:59,122 --> 00:26:00,820
We found the cabbie

593
00:26:00,863 --> 00:26:02,822
that dropped you off
at the motel.

594
00:26:02,865 --> 00:26:04,693
He ran from us, Joe.

595
00:26:04,737 --> 00:26:06,216
You know why?

596
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,218
I don't know. He know where the
Purple Heart is?

597
00:26:08,262 --> 00:26:09,829
No.

598
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:13,876
Heard there might be fireworks.

599
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,443
You really think Joe's lying?

600
00:26:15,486 --> 00:26:16,966
No idea. What?

601
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:19,142
You made a pretty good caseup in my office.

602
00:26:19,186 --> 00:26:22,058
Yeah, well, it could allbe true or not.

603
00:26:22,102 --> 00:26:24,670
Either way, Gibbs needed
a push to find out.

604
00:26:25,671 --> 00:26:27,020
Oh, wow.

605
00:26:27,063 --> 00:26:28,978
Full house here, huh?

606
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:31,807
Hey, Joe. Look at me.

607
00:26:36,551 --> 00:26:38,292
This all some kind of con?

608
00:26:38,335 --> 00:26:41,904
Con? You thinkthis is some kind of con?

609
00:26:41,948 --> 00:26:43,514
The Arizona.

610
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:45,604
Were you on it or not?

611
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:48,302
Would you like meto show you

612
00:26:48,345 --> 00:26:49,738
my arm again? No.

613
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:52,611
No, I want you
to prove it to me.

614
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:54,134
You prove it!

615
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:57,093
That's your job!

616
00:26:57,137 --> 00:26:58,573
Get the DNA.

617
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,010
There is no DNA, Joe.

618
00:27:02,533 --> 00:27:05,493
You are the only DNA we have.

619
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:08,627
What's in your head?
Your story? Something.

620
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,630
Anything that we can verify.

621
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:23,729
What do you think you're doing?

622
00:27:26,035 --> 00:27:29,038
You say you wereon the Arizona.

623
00:27:29,082 --> 00:27:30,692
What'd you see, Joe?

624
00:27:31,737 --> 00:27:33,042
Huh?

625
00:27:34,348 --> 00:27:35,349
What'd you smell?

626
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:39,962
What'd you taste?

627
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,012
Damn it, Joe.

628
00:27:46,055 --> 00:27:48,667
You want to go back? There's
only one way to go back.

629
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,277
Right now.

630
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:54,673
Was it your brother
or was it you?

631
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:55,761
It was me!

632
00:28:02,376 --> 00:28:05,161
I was on the quarterdeck,

633
00:28:05,205 --> 00:28:07,903
waiting for colors.

634
00:28:07,947 --> 00:28:11,777
And then me and Ozzie O'Connor
were-were gonna

635
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,170
catch the liberty launch

636
00:28:14,214 --> 00:28:16,346
and toss the football

637
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,479
on the beach.

638
00:28:19,654 --> 00:28:22,788
Then I hearda plane approaching.

639
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:28,097
I looked up.

640
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,408
I saw the red ball on its wing,

641
00:28:34,451 --> 00:28:37,367
and I knew.

642
00:28:37,411 --> 00:28:39,195
I ran to my battle station

643
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:41,458
in the gun pit,

644
00:28:41,502 --> 00:28:45,419
and that's when we caught
the big bomb.

645
00:28:47,203 --> 00:28:50,598
It was like the devil
opened his mouth

646
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:52,731
and made a noise

647
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:55,211
that was all screaming.

648
00:28:55,255 --> 00:28:57,170
The steel!

649
00:28:57,213 --> 00:28:59,085
The fire!

650
00:29:01,565 --> 00:29:03,785
The men.

651
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:08,529
I got orders to go topside.

652
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:11,793
What I saw was body parts

653
00:29:11,837 --> 00:29:14,143
all over the deck.

654
00:29:14,187 --> 00:29:16,885
Men stumbling through,

655
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:18,800
no hair,

656
00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:20,106
no clothes...

657
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:24,719
charred to the bone.

658
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,113
The smell...

659
00:29:29,115 --> 00:29:31,334
I threw up.

660
00:29:32,988 --> 00:29:36,078
That's when the plane...

661
00:29:36,122 --> 00:29:39,865
strafed us again.

662
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:43,738
My arm was screaming,

663
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,914
like nerves exposed.

664
00:29:47,742 --> 00:29:49,962
Shrapnel was hitting

665
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:52,442
what was already raw.

666
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:57,752
I was loaded intoa rescue launch.

667
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:01,016
I pulled three men
out of the water.

668
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:04,019
Two I didn't know.
The third...

669
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:08,676
The third was Ozzie...

670
00:30:11,026 --> 00:30:12,767
O'Connor.

671
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,814
He was trying to put
a piece of flesh

672
00:30:15,857 --> 00:30:18,904
back on his face.

673
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:20,993
I remember thinking about

674
00:30:21,036 --> 00:30:22,995
all the times

675
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:24,823
his mother must have

676
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:27,347
kissed that cheek.

677
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:30,393
And how we should have been

678
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:33,962
tossing a football.

679
00:30:34,006 --> 00:30:36,878
Then I got hit by...

680
00:30:36,922 --> 00:30:40,273
God knows what.

681
00:30:40,316 --> 00:30:43,842
I fell in the water,

682
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:46,845
woke up in the hospital.

683
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:50,500
I don't even know...

684
00:30:50,544 --> 00:30:53,155
who rescued me.

685
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:56,724
The point is, we saved each other.

686
00:30:58,813 --> 00:31:00,510
All of us.

687
00:31:03,209 --> 00:31:05,385
You've been in a war.

688
00:31:06,952 --> 00:31:09,868
You know why I want to go back.

689
00:31:10,956 --> 00:31:13,306
Shipmates are your brothers.

690
00:31:13,349 --> 00:31:16,135
More than my own blood.

691
00:31:16,178 --> 00:31:19,312
A bond...

692
00:31:19,355 --> 00:31:21,531
that never leaves.

693
00:31:23,794 --> 00:31:25,187
I want to be laid to rest

694
00:31:25,231 --> 00:31:27,233
with my family.

695
00:31:28,582 --> 00:31:30,584
I want to go home.

696
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:49,168
This is what you wanted, Joe.

697
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,609
With my signature.

698
00:31:56,784 --> 00:31:57,828
When you die,

699
00:31:57,872 --> 00:31:59,874
your ashes will be

700
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,921
interred on the Arizona.

701
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:12,191
But we still don't
have any hard proof.

702
00:32:12,234 --> 00:32:13,627
Can Gibbs really promise that?

703
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:16,847
No. No, he can't.

704
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,504
Joe?

705
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:23,506
All right, then.

706
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,987
I'll take you

707
00:32:26,031 --> 00:32:28,468
to the Purple Heart.

708
00:32:28,511 --> 00:32:31,340
It's back at the hotel.

709
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:34,474
I don't get it.

710
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:36,060
How could the Purple
Heart be at the motel?

711
00:32:36,084 --> 00:32:37,366
We searched that place,
like, five times.

712
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,000
Well, we should'vedone it six.

713
00:32:39,044 --> 00:32:40,349
We got a hit on the BOLO.

714
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:41,611
Cabbie Deacon?

715
00:32:41,655 --> 00:32:43,095
Yeah, MPD picked him up
for speeding.

716
00:32:43,135 --> 00:32:45,224
They're holding him for us. I'll update Vance.

717
00:32:51,752 --> 00:32:54,320
Look, man,
I can't go back to prison.

718
00:32:54,363 --> 00:32:56,626
And what exactly were you afraidyou'd be going back for?

719
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:59,455
Mr. Deacon, the more cooperation

720
00:32:59,499 --> 00:33:02,197
we get here, the more
a judge might understand.

721
00:33:03,242 --> 00:33:05,026
Yesterday, I dropped off a fare

722
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,115
across the street
from the old man's place.

723
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:08,551
You know him? Uh-uh. He saw me.

724
00:33:08,595 --> 00:33:09,900
He called me over.

725
00:33:09,944 --> 00:33:11,946
He was outside getting some airor something.

726
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,340
What did he say? He offered me 200 bucks
on top of my fare

727
00:33:14,383 --> 00:33:15,602
to drive him around.

728
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:16,666
All I had to do
was show up today,

729
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:19,345
pretend to be his
grandson, and...

730
00:33:19,388 --> 00:33:20,694
sign him out.

731
00:33:20,737 --> 00:33:21,912
Sign him out of where?

732
00:33:21,956 --> 00:33:23,610
The nursing home.
That's where he lives.

733
00:33:23,653 --> 00:33:25,220
I mean, they made it
seem like the guy

734
00:33:25,264 --> 00:33:26,526
ain't doing too good, like...

735
00:33:26,569 --> 00:33:28,832
he's really sick, man.

736
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,574
Purple Heart's right in there.

737
00:33:42,455 --> 00:33:44,413
You use a screwdriver? No, wouldn't need one.

738
00:33:44,457 --> 00:33:46,024
It just popped right off.

739
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,159
You know,

740
00:33:51,203 --> 00:33:52,639
I didn't want to...

741
00:33:52,682 --> 00:33:54,771
talk about that day.

742
00:33:54,815 --> 00:33:57,470
But I feel like

743
00:33:57,513 --> 00:34:00,908
I did something that kept it
from being forgotten.

744
00:34:03,563 --> 00:34:06,087
You want to talk
about what you saw?

745
00:34:08,524 --> 00:34:09,743
Uh,

746
00:34:09,786 --> 00:34:11,266
it may...

747
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,268
make you lighter, too.

748
00:34:13,312 --> 00:34:14,530
Hmm?

749
00:34:16,532 --> 00:34:17,620
Come on.

750
00:34:17,664 --> 00:34:19,492
Give it a shot, son.

751
00:34:26,673 --> 00:34:27,761
It's empty.

752
00:34:27,804 --> 00:34:29,067
What?

753
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,330
That's impossible.

754
00:34:31,373 --> 00:34:33,984
Yeah, I'm telling you,
there's nothing in there.

755
00:34:34,028 --> 00:34:35,682
No, I-I put it in there.

756
00:34:35,725 --> 00:34:37,075
I know I s...

757
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:38,511
It was, uh...

758
00:34:38,554 --> 00:34:40,513
It was just...

759
00:34:40,556 --> 00:34:42,491
Joe. Joseph. I put it in the
safest place possible.

760
00:34:42,515 --> 00:34:44,908
I was always gonnagive it back.

761
00:34:44,952 --> 00:34:47,302
Sit down. Joe.

762
00:34:47,346 --> 00:34:48,608
Joe.

763
00:34:58,705 --> 00:35:00,054
Hey.

764
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,577
So, how is he?

765
00:35:01,621 --> 00:35:03,623
It was a massive heart attack.

766
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:05,842
He's in surgery.

767
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:07,496
Well, we, uh...

768
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,585
we spoke to the nursing
home where Joe lives.

769
00:35:09,629 --> 00:35:12,632
He was being treated for
coronary artery disease,

770
00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:14,895
and he's in the early
stages of dementia.

771
00:35:14,938 --> 00:35:16,070
What? Yeah.

772
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,680
How early?

773
00:35:17,724 --> 00:35:19,310
McGEE: Nurse says he has
his good days and his bad days,

774
00:35:19,334 --> 00:35:21,902
but he was diagnosed before
he started writing letters

775
00:35:21,945 --> 00:35:23,904
to the admiral.

776
00:35:23,947 --> 00:35:25,906
He knew the endwas coming.

777
00:35:25,949 --> 00:35:28,691
He wanted to make sure his asheswere back on the Arizona.

778
00:35:28,735 --> 00:35:29,953
Or maybe

779
00:35:29,997 --> 00:35:31,955
he was just confused.

780
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:34,044
What if Joe's memories
were really just stories

781
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:35,829
his brother told him?

782
00:35:35,872 --> 00:35:38,527
This whole thing could
just be in his head.

783
00:35:40,747 --> 00:35:41,965
Hey, did you findanything?

784
00:35:42,009 --> 00:35:44,098
Nope. We, uh...
we questioned Deacon again.

785
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,056
He swears he never
saw a Purple Heart,

786
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,015
and he said that Joe
never even mentioned it.

787
00:35:48,058 --> 00:35:50,887
You search the cab? Yeah, and it wasn'tat Deacon's place either.

788
00:35:50,931 --> 00:35:52,474
So Joe's the only onewho knows what he did with it,

789
00:35:52,498 --> 00:35:54,152
and now even he doesn't know.

790
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:56,197
Well, that mightnot be entirely true.

791
00:35:56,241 --> 00:35:57,590
According to Gibbs,

792
00:35:57,633 --> 00:35:59,766
Joe insists that he put
the medal in a safe place.

793
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:02,203
That feeling was probably real. Yeah, well,

794
00:36:02,247 --> 00:36:03,441
feeling isn't
really much to go on.

795
00:36:03,465 --> 00:36:05,075
Yeah, he could've buried it
anywhere

796
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,426
and thought that he put it
in the vent.

797
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:09,645
Or, more likely,
he could've just transposed

798
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:11,169
a few of the details.

799
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:13,345
You mean like maybe
it was a different vent?

800
00:36:13,388 --> 00:36:17,349
So,
Joe knew that he removed a vent cover

801
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:19,351
and put the Purple Heart inside.

802
00:36:19,394 --> 00:36:21,353
We think he remembered

803
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:24,138
the location
of the vent incorrectly.

804
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:28,621
Well, he didn't need
a screwdriver.

805
00:36:33,103 --> 00:36:34,453
It's here.

806
00:36:45,725 --> 00:36:47,640
Is it damaged?

807
00:36:51,731 --> 00:36:54,124
No.

808
00:36:54,168 --> 00:36:56,039
It's perfect.

809
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:57,127
Thank you.

810
00:36:57,171 --> 00:36:59,086
Thank you.

811
00:36:59,129 --> 00:37:01,088
Hey, Gibbs. We found it.

812
00:37:01,131 --> 00:37:02,568
Joe was right.

813
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:05,310
He kept it
in the safest place possible.

814
00:37:05,353 --> 00:37:07,137
Never even left the house.

815
00:37:07,181 --> 00:37:09,749
That's great, Bishop.

816
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:11,229
That's good work.

817
00:37:12,621 --> 00:37:14,232
Uh, I'll call you back.

818
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:15,450
Agent Gibbs,

819
00:37:15,494 --> 00:37:17,147
we did all we could.

820
00:37:17,191 --> 00:37:20,455
Unfortunately,
Mr. Smith died in recovery.

821
00:37:20,499 --> 00:37:23,589
Do you know where the body should be sent?

822
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,118
Your hunch was right, Gibbs.

823
00:38:15,162 --> 00:38:17,401
I was able to find two piecesof metal embedded in the skin

824
00:38:17,425 --> 00:38:18,905
beneath Joe's burns.

825
00:38:18,948 --> 00:38:20,254
"Shrapnel

826
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,256
hit what was already raw."

827
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,364
That's exactly what Joe said.

828
00:38:23,388 --> 00:38:24,911
He wasn't kidding.

829
00:38:24,954 --> 00:38:27,261
Kasie was also able to determinethat one of the pieces

830
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,369
was actually a minuscule...

831
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:30,786
It was part of a bolt, Gibbs,

832
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:31,874
complete with fire damage.

833
00:38:31,918 --> 00:38:33,920
There's a...

834
00:38:33,963 --> 00:38:36,096
I'm sorry, Dr. Palmer.
I-I got a little excited.

835
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:37,663
By all means, sir, it's all you.

836
00:38:37,706 --> 00:38:40,361
So, a section of the
USS Arizona'ssuperstructure

837
00:38:40,405 --> 00:38:43,146
is on display at the Arizona
State Capitol Museum.

838
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:45,975
I made a call and I was able
to convince a very nice lady

839
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:47,281
to rush us a sample

840
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,717
of one of these bolts.

841
00:38:56,986 --> 00:38:58,118
It's a match.

842
00:38:58,161 --> 00:38:59,598
Mm-hmm. So not only

843
00:38:59,641 --> 00:39:00,990
was Joe on the Arizona

844
00:39:01,034 --> 00:39:02,620
when it was attacked, he also has been carrying

845
00:39:02,644 --> 00:39:06,169
a tiny piece of the ship
inside of him ever since.

846
00:39:06,213 --> 00:39:07,997
I called the memorial.

847
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:10,019
They're making arrangements
now for Joe's interment.

848
00:39:10,043 --> 00:39:11,479
Gibbs,

849
00:39:11,523 --> 00:39:13,307
Joe's going back to the Arizona.

850
00:39:22,621 --> 00:39:24,884
Hey.

851
00:39:24,927 --> 00:39:26,059
Hey, boss.

852
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:28,583
It's over there, by the door.

853
00:39:28,627 --> 00:39:30,803
Ah. Great.

854
00:39:30,846 --> 00:39:33,458
The longer you marinate
steaks, the better they are.

855
00:39:33,501 --> 00:39:35,024
Oh, no, I'm actually, uh...

856
00:39:35,068 --> 00:39:37,026
I'm actually gonna use itfor enchiladas.

857
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,419
Yeah, Torres says that, uh,

858
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:40,421
grilling 'em really brings it
to the next level.

859
00:39:40,465 --> 00:39:43,032
It's for that, uh, party
next weekend I had mentioned.

860
00:39:43,076 --> 00:39:44,947
I'm actually
looking forward to going.

861
00:39:44,991 --> 00:39:46,993
Yeah, well, keep it
as long as you need it.

862
00:39:47,036 --> 00:39:48,473
Thanks.

863
00:39:48,516 --> 00:39:51,084
Um, boss, listen, uh,

864
00:39:51,127 --> 00:39:53,478
I know, uh...

865
00:39:53,521 --> 00:39:56,698
I know that Joe didn'tlike me very much, but, uh,

866
00:39:56,742 --> 00:39:58,483
you sure you don't want meto go with you?

867
00:39:58,526 --> 00:40:00,006
Oh, he liked you, McGee.

868
00:40:00,049 --> 00:40:02,748
Just how those guys are.

869
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:03,923
No.

870
00:40:03,966 --> 00:40:04,924
I'm good.

871
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:06,491
Go home to your family.

872
00:40:06,534 --> 00:40:08,231
Thanks.

873
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:10,364
All right.

874
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,888
Hey, McGee.

875
00:40:12,932 --> 00:40:14,455
Yeah.

876
00:40:20,766 --> 00:40:22,942
You got a minute?

877
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:25,510
Yeah.

878
00:40:25,553 --> 00:40:27,120
Yeah.
What's up, boss?

879
00:40:34,344 --> 00:40:37,304
Uh...

880
00:40:37,347 --> 00:40:39,959
I want to tell you
something about Joe.

881
00:40:44,616 --> 00:40:47,053
Something about me.

882
00:40:53,102 --> 00:40:56,192
What I saw in Kuwait...

883
00:40:56,236 --> 00:40:59,195
Before that, I was different.

884
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:02,024
It took something from me.

885
00:41:02,068 --> 00:41:04,070
That's what war does.

886
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,425
Sometimes I think if my girls

887
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,906
had been there when I got home,

888
00:41:13,949 --> 00:41:16,256
maybe they wouldn't have
recognized me.

889
00:41:22,044 --> 00:41:25,483
Maybe there wouldn't have been
enough of me left

890
00:41:25,526 --> 00:41:27,310
for them to hang on to.

891
00:41:29,138 --> 00:41:31,314
Maybe the best of me

892
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:33,099
was gone.

893
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:37,016
You come home

894
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:38,887
and you're like half a person.

895
00:41:40,454 --> 00:41:42,195
The other half of you
is still back there,

896
00:41:42,238 --> 00:41:45,851
where at least it made sense.

897
00:41:47,243 --> 00:41:49,202
Where, even with the bullets

898
00:41:49,245 --> 00:41:51,683
and the blood and the chaos,

899
00:41:51,726 --> 00:41:54,076
you knew what mattered.

900
00:41:56,557 --> 00:41:58,124
You knew that
the guy next to you

901
00:41:58,167 --> 00:41:59,952
was willing to die for you

902
00:41:59,995 --> 00:42:01,997
and you for him.

903
00:42:06,611 --> 00:42:08,613
And you look around and think...

904
00:42:10,658 --> 00:42:13,574
it shouldn't take a war

905
00:42:13,618 --> 00:42:15,576
to make the world that simple.

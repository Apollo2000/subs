1
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:40,834
It's locked.

2
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:47,475
When the door opens, you can go in first.

3
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,543
- I know you were here first.
- Doesn't matter.

4
00:00:49,578 --> 00:00:51,445
If it didn't matter,
you wouldn't be here first.

5
00:00:52,515 --> 00:00:53,714
Did it start?

6
00:00:53,749 --> 00:00:54,948
It starts at 8:00.

7
00:00:54,984 --> 00:00:56,850
It's 8:00.
- It's 7:00.

8
00:00:58,487 --> 00:01:00,053
Ahh.

9
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,024
What is that?

10
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:05,893
Breakfast taco. Austin-style.

11
00:01:05,928 --> 00:01:08,061
- Scrambled eggs, onions...
- You're not allowed to eat in here.

12
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,787
- Why not?
- Because you're not allowed

13
00:01:09,822 --> 00:01:11,538
to eat in here. There's a sign out front.

14
00:01:11,573 --> 00:01:13,133
I didn't see a sign.

15
00:01:13,168 --> 00:01:14,901
Ignorance is no excuse.

16
00:01:14,936 --> 00:01:17,837
You're a prosecutor, aren't you?

17
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:20,640
Why don't you eat that over there?

18
00:01:20,675 --> 00:01:22,142
Why? Because I'm a public defender,

19
00:01:22,177 --> 00:01:23,376
or because of the<i> migas?</i>

20
00:01:23,412 --> 00:01:24,810
Do I have to choose?

21
00:01:39,027 --> 00:01:40,593
Why didn't you get me up this morning?

22
00:01:40,628 --> 00:01:41,761
I wanted to come down with you.

23
00:01:41,796 --> 00:01:42,961
I got up at 4:30.

24
00:01:42,996 --> 00:01:45,264
It would literally be impossible
for me to thank you enough

25
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,433
for not getting me up.

26
00:01:47,468 --> 00:01:49,234
Where's your boyfriend?

27
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,103
I have no boyfriend today.

28
00:01:51,138 --> 00:01:52,404
And Seth has no girlfriend.

29
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,805
We're keeping this professional.

30
00:02:09,089 --> 00:02:12,633
Uh, hey. She was here first.

31
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:16,260
Oh. I didn't realize.

32
00:02:17,878 --> 00:02:20,178
Assistant United States
Attorneys to the right.

33
00:02:20,214 --> 00:02:22,614
Federal Public Defenders to the left.

34
00:02:22,649 --> 00:02:23,848
You can sit together if you like,

35
00:02:23,884 --> 00:02:27,519
but if I've learned anything
after 27 years of doing this,

36
00:02:27,554 --> 00:02:29,955
it's that you don't like to sit together.

37
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:35,259
This is the swearing in
for incoming AUSAs and FPDs.

38
00:02:35,295 --> 00:02:36,509
Please check your ticket.

39
00:02:36,544 --> 00:02:38,563
Make sure you're on the right flight.

40
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:40,231
My name is Tina Krissman.

41
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:41,457
I am the clerk of court,

42
00:02:41,492 --> 00:02:42,801
I am on the second floor
of this building,

43
00:02:42,836 --> 00:02:44,869
and I am available every day

44
00:02:44,905 --> 00:02:47,906
from 7:50 a.m. to 4:40 p.m.

45
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:52,030
to ignore your questions.

46
00:02:53,146 --> 00:02:54,745
I smell onions.

47
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:02,124
I will find you.

48
00:03:03,022 --> 00:03:05,889
Chief Judge Nicholas Byrne.

49
00:03:08,961 --> 00:03:10,794
There are two great courts in America...

50
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,010
the Supreme Court,

51
00:03:12,045 --> 00:03:14,631
and the one you're sitting in right now.

52
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:16,934
This is the United States District Court

53
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:18,669
for the Southern District of New York...

54
00:03:18,704 --> 00:03:20,737
the oldest, most prestigious,

55
00:03:20,773 --> 00:03:23,573
highest-profile trial court in America.

56
00:03:23,608 --> 00:03:24,807
This is the court that heard claims

57
00:03:24,843 --> 00:03:26,943
over the sinking of the<i> Titanic.</i>

58
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:29,912
This is the court that heard
the case against the Rosenbergs.

59
00:03:29,948 --> 00:03:33,916
Aaron Burr was a lawyer in this court.

60
00:03:35,988 --> 00:03:37,787
Are you worthy?

61
00:03:37,822 --> 00:03:40,422
You've probably heard that some
people call this the "Mother Court."

62
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:44,827
For as long as you work here,
you will call it home.

63
00:03:44,863 --> 00:03:46,996
The cases are hard, the stakes are high,

64
00:03:47,031 --> 00:03:50,032
the lawyers on the other side
are better than you,

65
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:53,503
and the judges are smarter than you.

66
00:03:53,538 --> 00:03:55,637
Some of you...

67
00:03:55,672 --> 00:03:57,139
won't succeed.

68
00:03:57,174 --> 00:03:59,174
Some of you...

69
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,043
are<i> not</i> worthy.

70
00:04:01,078 --> 00:04:03,312
But for those of you who are,

71
00:04:03,347 --> 00:04:07,049
your time here will be
the highlight of your career.

72
00:04:10,888 --> 00:04:14,890
"I do solemnly swear
that I will support and defend

73
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:17,158
the Constitution of the United States,

74
00:04:17,193 --> 00:04:19,528
that I will bear
true faith and allegiance

75
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:21,396
to the Government of the United States,

76
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:24,799
that I will maintain the respect
due to the Courts of Justice

77
00:04:24,835 --> 00:04:26,367
and the Judicial Officers,

78
00:04:26,403 --> 00:04:28,569
and that I will demean myself
as an attorney,

79
00:04:28,604 --> 00:04:32,306
proctor, advocate, and counselor
of this Court uprightly,

80
00:04:32,342 --> 00:04:35,076
according to law, so help me God."

81
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:37,678
Welcome to the Mother Court.

83
00:04:52,194 --> 00:04:54,528
Good morning, everyone. I'm Jill Carlan.

84
00:04:54,564 --> 00:04:56,163
I'm the Federal Public Defender.

85
00:04:56,198 --> 00:04:59,066
Inside these envelopes
is your first case,

86
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:00,833
and let me warn you...

87
00:05:00,869 --> 00:05:02,436
You're not gonna win.

88
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:04,337
You're up against
the United States government,

89
00:05:04,373 --> 00:05:06,039
and the government almost always wins

90
00:05:06,075 --> 00:05:07,607
because they have all the power.

91
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:09,042
Now, here's the good news.

92
00:05:09,078 --> 00:05:12,112
You don't need to win. You need<i> a</i> win.

93
00:05:12,147 --> 00:05:13,349
Reduce the charge,

94
00:05:13,385 --> 00:05:15,882
get a piece of critical
testimony thrown out,

95
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:17,784
get your client released on bail...

96
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:18,918
get something.

97
00:05:18,954 --> 00:05:20,053
If you can do that, you've won.

98
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:23,422
And I know you can do that.
Or you wouldn't be here.

99
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:30,939
My name is Roger Gunn.

100
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,525
I am your boss.

101
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:36,435
This is your first case.

102
00:05:36,471 --> 00:05:38,036
I expect you to win.

103
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,148
I got a good one. What'd you score?

104
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,883
- Terrorism.
- Terrorism.

105
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,151
Sweet.

106
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,352
Nail it.

107
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,159
What's "duty"?

108
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,329
The attorney on duty picks up
the new cases that come in.

109
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,487
Do you need someone today?

110
00:06:05,522 --> 00:06:07,332
Yes, but you have to have some experience

111
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,334
to be on duty, Sandra. I have experience.

112
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,636
You have experience clerking
on the Supreme Court,

113
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:12,763
which is great experience

114
00:06:12,798 --> 00:06:15,140
for being a Justice on the Supreme Court.

115
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,674
Doesn't have anything to do
with this job.

116
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,975
I'll put you on duty when you're ready.

117
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:19,161
I'm ready.

118
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,648
Okay. You're on duty.

119
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,182
Great.

120
00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:26,784
Thank you.

121
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:27,952
So, what do I do?

122
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,086
Use your experience.

123
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:34,358
It's okay. I like a challenge.

124
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,660
You're the only person I've ever met

125
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:36,761
who goes out of her way to make

126
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,462
an extremely hard job even harder.

127
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:40,030
Do you at least recognize
how weird that is?

128
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:42,032
I do.

129
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:44,100
See, I'm happy with my envelope.

130
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:46,637
- What did you get?
- Ah, some trumped-up fraud charge.

131
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,938
I figure I could either
read the lies from the AUSA

132
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:50,207
or talk to my client.

133
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:51,808
- Mm.
- I trust my client.

134
00:06:51,843 --> 00:06:52,856
You two know each other from law school?

135
00:06:52,892 --> 00:06:54,478
Yeah, first day. Torts. Front row.

136
00:06:54,513 --> 00:06:57,147
Ah. Too close for torts, but that's cool.

137
00:06:57,182 --> 00:06:59,049
- Where you living in the city?
- Upper East Side.

138
00:06:59,084 --> 00:07:00,483
Ah. Less cool all of a sudden.

139
00:07:00,518 --> 00:07:02,052
It's her place. I'm just squatting there.

140
00:07:11,763 --> 00:07:13,329
You don't mess around.

141
00:07:13,364 --> 00:07:15,665
I have a bail hearing.
Why would I be messing around?

142
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,234
No, I-I just meant... the...

143
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:21,704
Doesn't matter. Uh, I heard
you were a procedural guru.

144
00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:23,506
- Can I ask you a question?
- If you have to,

145
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:24,807
but I don't want to be the help desk

146
00:07:24,842 --> 00:07:27,710
for every man in this office too lazy
to look something up for himself.

147
00:07:27,745 --> 00:07:30,179
Were you too lazy to look
this up for yourself?

148
00:07:30,214 --> 00:07:32,247
I can look this up myself.

149
00:07:32,282 --> 00:07:35,718
If it's about your terrorism case,

150
00:07:35,753 --> 00:07:37,252
you shouldn't waste your time.

151
00:07:37,287 --> 00:07:38,386
Why not?

152
00:07:38,422 --> 00:07:40,488
Um, because I don't think
that's gonna be your case

153
00:07:40,524 --> 00:07:42,224
for very much longer.

154
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:44,860
Why would I give you his case?

155
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,428
Because a farm animal
could win this case,

156
00:07:46,463 --> 00:07:47,895
and that case actually matters,

157
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:49,431
and if it matters,
you should give it to me.

158
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:51,099
When I was clerking on the Supreme Court,

159
00:07:51,134 --> 00:07:52,066
this kid was writing research memos

160
00:07:52,102 --> 00:07:54,769
for junior partners
at a mid-tier law firm.

161
00:07:54,804 --> 00:07:57,004
Is that true?

162
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,840
Leonard doesn't think
you're ready for this case.

163
00:07:58,875 --> 00:07:59,841
Well, he's right.

164
00:07:59,876 --> 00:08:01,843
Neither one of us is ready
for a case like this,

165
00:08:01,878 --> 00:08:03,611
but I'm at least humble enough
to recognize it,

166
00:08:03,646 --> 00:08:05,510
and I'll work that much harder
because of it.

167
00:08:15,091 --> 00:08:17,125
Never been a fan of humility.

168
00:08:22,498 --> 00:08:24,265
- He took your case?
- Stole it.

169
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,332
- Stole it?
- That's what I'm saying.

170
00:08:25,368 --> 00:08:27,534
And then he said I worked
at a "mid-tier law firm."

171
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,236
I did not work at a mid-tier law firm.

172
00:08:30,573 --> 00:08:32,873
Okay. That doesn't help.

173
00:08:32,908 --> 00:08:35,242
Don't worry about the case, Seth. Don't.

174
00:08:35,277 --> 00:08:37,811
Do a good job on your new case,
and you'll get recognized

175
00:08:37,846 --> 00:08:39,646
because you're good and decent,

176
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:41,581
and you do things the right way,

177
00:08:41,616 --> 00:08:43,817
which is what matters
in the long run, okay?

178
00:08:43,852 --> 00:08:45,551
Okay?

179
00:08:45,587 --> 00:08:48,288
Now, I have to go because
<i>I</i> have my first appearance

180
00:08:48,323 --> 00:08:51,124
as an attorney in the
Southern District of New York.

181
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,224
So do I.

182
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,893
Well, let's go kick some ass then.

183
00:09:13,881 --> 00:09:16,081
Ms. Krissman.

184
00:09:16,117 --> 00:09:18,851
I'm Sandra Bell from the FPD.
I'm on duty today.

185
00:09:22,223 --> 00:09:27,292
So, uh, if any cases come in,
I will be right here.

186
00:09:27,328 --> 00:09:28,694
That's not a great place to be,

187
00:09:28,729 --> 00:09:30,995
because when cases come in,
I e-mail them to you,

188
00:09:31,031 --> 00:09:32,798
which is what I did 15 minutes ago.

189
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:33,878
I don't have any service here.

190
00:09:33,913 --> 00:09:35,600
Then you probably don't know
that your hearing

191
00:09:35,636 --> 00:09:37,502
starts in eight minutes.

192
00:09:37,538 --> 00:09:40,305
Courtroom 601. Avoid the elevator.
Take the stairs.

193
00:09:40,341 --> 00:09:42,907
And be grateful you called me
Ms. Krissman.

194
00:09:57,023 --> 00:10:00,023
I'm Sandra Bell. I'm your attorney.

195
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:01,692
Mohammed Fayed.

196
00:10:06,232 --> 00:10:08,298
What's the charge?

197
00:10:08,334 --> 00:10:10,368
18 USC 2332.

198
00:10:10,403 --> 00:10:11,395
You pick this up on duty?

199
00:10:11,431 --> 00:10:13,404
- Yes.
- Tough day to be on duty.

200
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:14,724
2332 is attempted...

201
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:16,340
"Attempted use of a weapon
of mass destruction

202
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,041
against any property
that is owned, leased, or used

203
00:10:18,077 --> 00:10:20,143
by the United States
or by any department or agency

204
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:21,356
of the United States." I know.

205
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:23,413
What was my client allegedly
attempting to destroy?

206
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:25,515
Leonard Knox.

207
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,690
Sandra Bell.

208
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,218
All rise!

209
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:30,653
Your client tried to blow up the
Statue of Liberty, Sandra Bell.

210
00:10:43,472 --> 00:10:45,139
Your Honor, as alleged in the complaint,

211
00:10:45,174 --> 00:10:47,108
Madeline Locarno was
an administrative assistant

212
00:10:47,143 --> 00:10:49,143
at Alaria Pharmaceuticals

213
00:10:49,178 --> 00:10:51,212
and illegally traded
on inside information

214
00:10:51,247 --> 00:10:53,847
regarding a merger between
Alaria and Biogene...

215
00:10:53,882 --> 00:10:55,115
Excuse me, Your Honor, but the complaint

216
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,016
actually does not allege that.

217
00:10:57,052 --> 00:10:59,052
It alleges that Ms. Locarno
passed on information

218
00:10:59,087 --> 00:11:01,555
to her ex-husband,
who executed the trades...

219
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,723
facts which we deny.

220
00:11:02,758 --> 00:11:04,057
What was the value of the trades?

221
00:11:04,092 --> 00:11:07,294
$9,325.54, Your Honor.

222
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:09,162
$9,000?

223
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,900
This is what Roger Gunn is prioritizing

224
00:11:13,935 --> 00:11:16,102
in the U.S. Attorney's Office nowadays?

225
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,332
I thought that was fun.

226
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:21,307
Fun? We have to get out of this.

227
00:11:21,342 --> 00:11:23,076
So talk to Gunn. Get off the case.

228
00:11:23,111 --> 00:11:26,579
Your Honor, this is a minor fraud charge,

229
00:11:26,614 --> 00:11:29,047
and we're simply asking
for reasonable bail

230
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,650
so that my client, Adam Dyle,

231
00:11:30,685 --> 00:11:32,551
can continue to care
for his twin brother,

232
00:11:32,587 --> 00:11:34,987
who is dying of cancer.

233
00:11:39,594 --> 00:11:41,193
I find myself

234
00:11:41,228 --> 00:11:44,229
unexpectedly moved by defense counsel...

235
00:11:45,099 --> 00:11:46,498
to indignation.

236
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:48,366
Adam Dyle's brother
isn't dying of cancer,

237
00:11:48,402 --> 00:11:50,235
because he doesn't exist.

238
00:11:50,271 --> 00:11:53,172
Nor really does Adam Dyle,
which isn't that man's name.

239
00:11:53,207 --> 00:11:55,073
His name is Matthew Ormond. Or wait.

240
00:11:55,109 --> 00:11:57,242
No, it's Baron Heinz Geinecke. I'm sorry.

241
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:00,211
Did I say Baron Heinz Geinecke?
I meant Abigail Konogo.

242
00:12:00,246 --> 00:12:03,214
It really depends on
what con he's running.

243
00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:05,750
They're not hard to track down,
if you do a little work.

244
00:12:05,786 --> 00:12:08,353
Mr. Dyle is charged with
creating the absurdly named

245
00:12:08,388 --> 00:12:09,621
and entirely fake

246
00:12:09,656 --> 00:12:12,223
"United States Bureau of Organization"

247
00:12:12,258 --> 00:12:14,859
to issue fake
governmental purchase orders,

248
00:12:14,894 --> 00:12:16,961
with which he swindled
hundreds of thousands of dollars

249
00:12:16,996 --> 00:12:18,896
of very real money

250
00:12:18,932 --> 00:12:21,365
from small businesses
all over the New York area.

251
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,234
It's enough to...

252
00:12:25,504 --> 00:12:27,272
Well, to make you sick.

253
00:12:31,144 --> 00:12:33,377
Please advise the court
if there any plea discussions.

254
00:12:33,412 --> 00:12:34,511
We're already talking, Your Honor.

255
00:12:34,547 --> 00:12:37,280
Talking? What are we talking about?

256
00:12:37,316 --> 00:12:39,616
I'm offering you 15 years
as opposed to life.

257
00:12:39,652 --> 00:12:41,418
See? Talking.

258
00:12:41,454 --> 00:12:43,153
I haven't seen the discovery yet.

259
00:12:43,188 --> 00:12:44,788
Once we get bogged down in discovery,

260
00:12:44,824 --> 00:12:46,890
it's hard to get a deal done.

261
00:12:46,925 --> 00:12:48,291
It's hard for me to get a deal done

262
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:49,459
when I don't know
what's in the discovery.

263
00:12:49,494 --> 00:12:51,661
Listen, you seem bright, and
you got dealt a bad hand here,

264
00:12:51,696 --> 00:12:53,129
and I'm sorry about that. I really am.

265
00:12:53,165 --> 00:12:56,166
I feel... bad for you,
but don't make it worse.

266
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:58,235
Because here's the thing you
need to understand about me...

267
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,237
I'm the guy who makes it worse.

268
00:13:00,272 --> 00:13:02,172
I'm the guy you don't want
to go up against.

269
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:04,074
I didn't stumble into this case.

270
00:13:04,109 --> 00:13:06,976
I saw it, I wanted it, and I took it.

271
00:13:07,011 --> 00:13:09,689
Now I'm offering you a way
to get out of it.

272
00:13:11,115 --> 00:13:13,483
If they're offering a deal
like that in a case like this,

273
00:13:13,518 --> 00:13:15,351
there must be something wrong
with the evidence.

274
00:13:15,387 --> 00:13:17,152
Maybe. But if you want to find out,

275
00:13:17,188 --> 00:13:18,220
you're gonna have to reject the offer,

276
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,289
and if you reject the offer,
you're going to trial.

277
00:13:20,324 --> 00:13:22,524
And if you go to trial,
you're going to lose.

278
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,159
A big loss in a big case.

279
00:13:24,195 --> 00:13:25,494
I can give it to someone else.

280
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:27,129
No.

281
00:13:27,164 --> 00:13:28,364
Do you follow baseball?

282
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,799
- Uh...
- In 1993,

283
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:32,167
the San Francisco Giants won
a record 103 games,

284
00:13:32,203 --> 00:13:34,136
but they still had to win
the final game of the season

285
00:13:34,171 --> 00:13:35,271
to make the playoffs.

286
00:13:35,306 --> 00:13:39,107
They had two experienced
20-game winners on their staff,

287
00:13:39,142 --> 00:13:41,405
but the manager decided
to start Salomon Torres,

288
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,878
a 21-year-old rookie

289
00:13:42,913 --> 00:13:44,846
who'd only been pitching in
the major leagues for a month.

290
00:13:44,882 --> 00:13:46,180
You've never been to a game?

291
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:48,316
A-A few times.

292
00:13:48,351 --> 00:13:49,651
Huh.

293
00:13:49,686 --> 00:13:52,053
Anyway, he got destroyed.

294
00:13:52,088 --> 00:13:54,689
Gave up 3 runs, 5 hits,
walked 5 in 3 innings.

295
00:13:54,725 --> 00:13:56,124
The Giants lost,

296
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,959
didn't make the playoffs
for four more years,

297
00:13:57,994 --> 00:13:59,961
and Torres went on
to a forgettable career.

298
00:13:59,996 --> 00:14:01,396
He never lived that game down.

299
00:14:01,431 --> 00:14:04,632
Is that how you want
to start<i> your</i> career?

300
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:07,302
Talk to your client about the deal.

301
00:14:10,273 --> 00:14:12,084
I'm really disappointed.

302
00:14:13,008 --> 00:14:16,209
In you. Specifically.

303
00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:17,319
Okay.

304
00:14:17,354 --> 00:14:20,213
Well, thank you for being specific.

305
00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:22,382
Did you not like the way I told the judge

306
00:14:22,418 --> 00:14:25,052
about your fake brother dying
of fake cancer or...

307
00:14:25,087 --> 00:14:27,421
Look, I was just following
Bureau protocol.

308
00:14:27,457 --> 00:14:28,503
And if we're ever confronted,

309
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:30,490
we're supposed to protect our identity.

310
00:14:30,525 --> 00:14:33,360
People have a lot of hostility
about the work we do.

311
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:36,997
These purchase orders were
for a technology upgrade.

312
00:14:37,032 --> 00:14:39,566
Why didn't you tell the judge
we're entitled to an upgrade?

313
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:44,438
You really believe the Bureau
of Organization exists?

314
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,440
What do you mean? Of course it exists.
I work there.

315
00:14:49,277 --> 00:14:51,243
The offer is 15.

316
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,980
I'm not saying I can get to 10,

317
00:14:53,015 --> 00:14:54,832
but... if I can.

318
00:14:54,867 --> 00:14:56,883
Wait. 10 years in jail, right?

319
00:14:56,918 --> 00:14:58,250
Yes.

320
00:14:58,286 --> 00:14:59,686
Jail.

321
00:14:59,721 --> 00:15:01,354
Federal prison.

322
00:15:08,896 --> 00:15:11,763
What are the others getting?

323
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:13,132
Others?

324
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:14,967
What others?

325
00:15:15,003 --> 00:15:16,869
Th-The team.

326
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:19,950
I'm not getting off the case.

327
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,010
Well, I'm not asking you
to get off the case.

328
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,908
I'm just saying that
I'm not getting off the case.

329
00:15:22,943 --> 00:15:24,309
The $9,000 case?

330
00:15:24,344 --> 00:15:26,812
Yeah, the one against the woman
who broke the law?

331
00:15:26,847 --> 00:15:28,380
That one? Yes.

332
00:15:28,415 --> 00:15:29,982
Well, it's not a problem for me.

333
00:15:30,017 --> 00:15:31,539
Great.

334
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:34,452
It could be a problem for you.

335
00:15:34,488 --> 00:15:37,389
Why? Oh, right. Right.

336
00:15:37,424 --> 00:15:38,556
Because you think you're gonna beat me.

337
00:15:38,591 --> 00:15:39,624
You heard what the judge said.

338
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:42,427
The lawyers on the other side
are better than you.

339
00:15:42,462 --> 00:15:44,595
He said that to both sides.

340
00:15:44,631 --> 00:15:46,731
He was looking at your side more.

341
00:15:46,766 --> 00:15:48,099
His head was turned towards you.

342
00:15:48,135 --> 00:15:49,473
Mm.

343
00:15:52,605 --> 00:15:54,805
We<i> can</i> do this, right?

344
00:15:54,841 --> 00:15:57,441
We can do this.

345
00:15:58,978 --> 00:16:00,377
And I can do this.

346
00:16:04,483 --> 00:16:05,616
Al?

347
00:16:05,652 --> 00:16:09,353
I didn't hear you come home.

348
00:16:09,388 --> 00:16:11,522
Are you okay?

349
00:16:11,557 --> 00:16:13,390
I'm gonna do this.

350
00:16:17,563 --> 00:16:19,763
You know how we've always said
that if one of us

351
00:16:19,798 --> 00:16:21,631
is about to do something really risky

352
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:22,799
but she really believes in it,

353
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:26,937
then the other will be there
to support her no matter what?

354
00:16:26,972 --> 00:16:28,538
We've never said that.

355
00:16:28,574 --> 00:16:30,139
Really?

356
00:16:30,175 --> 00:16:32,341
Okay, well, can you say it
to me now, please?

357
00:16:32,377 --> 00:16:33,944
What are you going to do, Sandra?

358
00:16:37,382 --> 00:16:38,548
Sandra Bell.

359
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:40,016
Send over the discovery.

360
00:16:40,052 --> 00:16:40,983
You know what that means.

361
00:16:41,018 --> 00:16:43,352
It means you send over
the discovery right now.

362
00:16:43,388 --> 00:16:45,388
We are done talking.

363
00:16:45,423 --> 00:16:46,922
He's not taking the deal.

364
00:16:48,726 --> 00:16:51,494
I'm gonna save Mohammed Fayed.

365
00:16:59,173 --> 00:17:02,174
You rejected a plea deal
without talking to me.

366
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,142
You said talk to my client.
I talked to my client.

367
00:17:04,177 --> 00:17:06,678
Well, you didn't talk to me,
and that was a mistake,

368
00:17:06,714 --> 00:17:08,614
and you can't afford
to make mistakes like that

369
00:17:08,649 --> 00:17:10,886
on a job like this.

370
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,546
You better find something in these boxes.

371
00:17:16,523 --> 00:17:18,257
What did you want to talk about?

372
00:17:18,292 --> 00:17:20,324
Well, Kate, here's the problem. For you.

373
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,359
My client,

374
00:17:21,394 --> 00:17:23,594
and let's keep it simple
and call him "Adam Dyle,"

375
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:26,364
couldn't have committed
the alleged fraud because...

376
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:29,600
as you probably have tabbed
there in one of your binders...

377
00:17:29,636 --> 00:17:32,670
fraud requires an intent to deceive,

378
00:17:32,705 --> 00:17:35,273
and Adam didn't intend to deceive anyone.

379
00:17:35,308 --> 00:17:38,175
Because he actually believes
all this is real.

380
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,677
Crazy? Possibly.

381
00:17:39,712 --> 00:17:44,114
But the upshot is, no intent, no crime.

382
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,798
So...

383
00:17:46,886 --> 00:17:48,686
let's work something out here.

384
00:17:48,721 --> 00:17:51,188
Are you done?

385
00:17:51,223 --> 00:17:53,523
I had some other cool points
to make, but, yeah, sure.

386
00:17:55,727 --> 00:17:58,295
<i>Yeah, he's buying the whole thing.</i>

387
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:59,997
<i> Yeah, everything.</i>
<i>That's what I'm saying.</i>

388
00:18:00,032 --> 00:18:02,900
<i>The Bureau. The technology upgrade.</i>

389
00:18:02,935 --> 00:18:04,701
<i>Yeah, I've gone full
"Primal Fear" on him.</i>

390
00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:07,204
<i> Yeah, this guy's a real tool.</i>

391
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:09,339
Tab Four of my discovery guide...

392
00:18:09,374 --> 00:18:11,308
request jailhouse recordings.

393
00:18:13,878 --> 00:18:16,179
Did you still want to make one
of your cool points?

394
00:18:19,451 --> 00:18:21,150
And now she's got the discovery.

395
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:22,218
You know what's in the discovery.

396
00:18:22,253 --> 00:18:25,054
You know what I know?
I know you wanted the case.

397
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:27,223
So make the case.

398
00:18:27,258 --> 00:18:28,858
Or I could always give it back to<i> him.</i>

399
00:18:33,431 --> 00:18:35,764
Uh, actually, sir, can we talk?

400
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,834
It's about opposing counsel

401
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:39,268
- on the insider-trading case.
- Uh-huh.

402
00:18:39,304 --> 00:18:40,870
She's my girlfriend.
Does this story get even

403
00:18:40,905 --> 00:18:41,870
mildly interesting at some point?

404
00:18:41,905 --> 00:18:43,405
- Well, we live together.
- Apparently it doesn't.

405
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:46,241
I need to be reassigned.

406
00:18:46,276 --> 00:18:48,276
'Cause of your boo?

407
00:18:48,312 --> 00:18:49,611
Her client can waive the conflict,

408
00:18:49,647 --> 00:18:50,579
if that's the problem.

409
00:18:50,614 --> 00:18:52,414
- Is that the problem?
- I just don't understand

410
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,416
why we're prosecuting a case like this,

411
00:18:54,452 --> 00:18:58,186
against a secretary for a $9,000 trade?

412
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:00,788
Well, that is a problem
that you don't understand that.

413
00:19:00,824 --> 00:19:03,291
So l-let me spell it out for you.

414
00:19:03,327 --> 00:19:05,927
You're prosecuting the case
'cause I told you to.

415
00:19:05,963 --> 00:19:07,295
And I told you to prosecute the case

416
00:19:07,331 --> 00:19:08,897
'cause that secretary broke the law.

417
00:19:08,932 --> 00:19:10,631
Every now and then,
regular, everyday people

418
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:12,700
need to be reminded that
there's serious consequences

419
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:14,035
to breaking the law. Whatever the law.

420
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:16,904
Insider trading. Taxes. Stop signs.

421
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:18,539
People start doing whatever
the hell they feel like,

422
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:20,408
our whole system breaks down.

423
00:19:20,443 --> 00:19:23,411
Cars crash, Markets crash.
People get hurt.

424
00:19:23,446 --> 00:19:24,912
You understand that?

425
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,817
I knew about the merger. We all did.

426
00:19:29,853 --> 00:19:32,119
Everyone in the company
was talking about it.

427
00:19:32,154 --> 00:19:35,622
I told my ex-husband, Eric,
I might be losing my job.

428
00:19:35,657 --> 00:19:37,324
Because I know sometimes,

429
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,826
when these companies merge,
we lose our jobs.

430
00:19:40,871 --> 00:19:42,596
I have a daughter.

431
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:44,831
And your ex-husband traded
on that information

432
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:46,066
without your knowledge?

433
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,461
I guess so.

434
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:49,936
I never knew anything about it.

435
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:52,272
I didn't get anything out of this.

436
00:19:59,147 --> 00:20:00,891
Are you kidding me?

437
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:05,151
Motion to dismiss. It's good.

438
00:20:05,186 --> 00:20:06,319
And I'm not just complimenting

439
00:20:06,354 --> 00:20:07,620
your, uh... your girlfriend.

440
00:20:07,655 --> 00:20:08,487
If she can convince the judge

441
00:20:08,523 --> 00:20:10,023
there was no benefit to Ms. Locarno,

442
00:20:10,058 --> 00:20:11,357
then we lose the case.

443
00:20:11,393 --> 00:20:13,092
By which I mean, you lose this case.

444
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,527
I don't have a response to this.

445
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:16,162
Okay, first,

446
00:20:16,197 --> 00:20:17,696
don't ever say something
like that to your boss.

447
00:20:17,732 --> 00:20:19,265
Second, you don't need to respond.

448
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,435
You need to make it irrelevant.

449
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,602
Raise the stakes. Apply the pressure.

450
00:20:23,638 --> 00:20:25,103
You want to win, don't you?

451
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:26,472
A superseding indictment.

452
00:20:26,507 --> 00:20:27,506
With three new charges

453
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:29,708
that, together, could mean
significant jail time.

454
00:20:29,744 --> 00:20:31,544
It's good. Clever. Cruel.

455
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:32,778
Vintage Roger Gunn.

456
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,513
He's forcing you into a deal.

457
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:35,648
This is how they win.

458
00:20:39,553 --> 00:20:41,686
I was never gonna prosecute
the additional charges.

459
00:20:41,721 --> 00:20:43,388
Is this supposed to make me
feel better about you?

460
00:20:43,424 --> 00:20:45,457
We needed to pressure you to make a deal.

461
00:20:45,492 --> 00:20:47,392
This is business. I did what I had to do.

462
00:20:47,428 --> 00:20:49,461
No, you did what your political,

463
00:20:49,496 --> 00:20:51,229
diabolical boss told you to do

464
00:20:51,265 --> 00:20:53,798
because you're insecure about
working at a mid-tier law firm.

465
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:55,533
Mm! It was not mid-tier!

466
00:20:55,569 --> 00:20:56,501
Why are you making this
personal, Allison?

467
00:20:56,536 --> 00:20:58,903
It<i> is</i> personal! This is personal.

468
00:20:58,939 --> 00:21:01,539
She's a person.
Her name is Madeline Locarno.

469
00:21:01,575 --> 00:21:03,541
She's 44. She has a child.

470
00:21:03,577 --> 00:21:06,243
And she'll go to jail.
Why are you doing this?

471
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:08,580
Because I believe in it.

472
00:21:08,615 --> 00:21:09,647
Has that ever crossed your mind?

473
00:21:09,683 --> 00:21:11,915
That I might actually believe
in what I'm doing?

474
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:13,417
That I might actually believe

475
00:21:13,453 --> 00:21:16,187
that Madeline Locarno broke the law

476
00:21:16,222 --> 00:21:18,422
and that there's some virtue
in enforcing the law?

477
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,091
If you believed in what you're doing,

478
00:21:20,126 --> 00:21:21,525
you wouldn't be doing this.

479
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,394
That's what I believe.

480
00:21:28,701 --> 00:21:31,034
Are you sleeping here? I'm sleeping here.

481
00:21:31,069 --> 00:21:32,603
- That bad?
- Worse.

482
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:34,437
"There is some virtue
in enforcing the law."

483
00:21:34,473 --> 00:21:36,874
- Who says that?
- A prosecutor. He's a prosecutor.

484
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:39,576
He's a good person. He used to be.

485
00:21:39,612 --> 00:21:40,677
He cried during "La La Land."

486
00:21:40,713 --> 00:21:42,278
Not the mark of a good person.

487
00:21:42,314 --> 00:21:43,213
How's it going here?

488
00:21:43,248 --> 00:21:46,516
I am two boxes away from getting fired.

489
00:21:49,954 --> 00:21:52,389
Are you at your limit here, Sandy?

490
00:21:52,424 --> 00:21:54,557
Yes, I am. I am at my limit.

491
00:21:54,592 --> 00:21:55,694
But that's where I need to be right now

492
00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:57,448
because that is where he needs me to be.

493
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:01,931
Okay, well, let me tell you
where<i> I</i> need to be.

494
00:22:01,966 --> 00:22:06,402
I need to be drunk anywhere,
so let's compromise.

495
00:22:06,437 --> 00:22:09,038
We are working for two more hours,

496
00:22:09,073 --> 00:22:10,472
and then we're going to drink.

497
00:22:10,508 --> 00:22:12,642
And I will complain
mercilessly about Seth,

498
00:22:12,677 --> 00:22:13,576
and you will tell me to stop,
and I'll say,

499
00:22:13,611 --> 00:22:14,877
"Yes, you're right. Let's go play darts."

500
00:22:14,913 --> 00:22:16,245
Then we'll go play darts,

501
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,479
and I'll be hitting
the bull's-eye every time...

502
00:22:17,515 --> 00:22:18,647
boom, boom, boom... and you'll wonder

503
00:22:18,682 --> 00:22:19,648
how I got so good at darts,
and I'll say it's because

504
00:22:19,683 --> 00:22:21,983
I'm imagining Seth's face
on the dart board.

505
00:22:24,855 --> 00:22:26,455
What?

506
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,323
That "team" Fayed said
he was working with

507
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:30,276
to blow up the Statue of Liberty?

508
00:22:30,312 --> 00:22:33,042
They were undercover FBI agents.

509
00:22:33,077 --> 00:22:34,495
This was a sting.

510
00:22:38,602 --> 00:22:40,301
There was a team of three agents.

511
00:22:40,336 --> 00:22:41,636
They had been working on him
for 18 months.

512
00:22:41,672 --> 00:22:43,905
Fayed was working was supposed to
carry what he thought was a bomb

513
00:22:43,941 --> 00:22:45,506
into the crown of the Statue
of Liberty in a camera,

514
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:46,741
but he was mistakenly arrested

515
00:22:46,777 --> 00:22:48,142
by a National Park Service Ranger

516
00:22:48,178 --> 00:22:50,945
before he could get there.
What... What is this?

517
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,947
Extra paper. Stuff it in your bag.

518
00:22:52,982 --> 00:22:54,648
You should always carry a lot of paper.

519
00:22:54,684 --> 00:22:57,618
They get worried you have
something they don't know about.

520
00:22:57,653 --> 00:22:58,686
You know what we're doing here, right?

521
00:22:58,721 --> 00:23:01,488
- No.
- Then watch.

522
00:23:01,523 --> 00:23:04,658
It's bad for this office.
It's bad for the FBI.

523
00:23:04,694 --> 00:23:06,493
Oh, now, see, alarm bells go off for me

524
00:23:06,528 --> 00:23:09,162
when Jill Carlan is worried
about what's good for the FBI.

525
00:23:09,198 --> 00:23:10,763
You can't win on entrapment, Jill.

526
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:11,898
And we're not trying to.

527
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:14,534
This case is about attempt,
and you can't prove attempt,

528
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:17,309
because he was arrested before
he got to the Statue of Liberty.

529
00:23:17,344 --> 00:23:18,605
Attempt only requires the defendant

530
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,707
to take a substantial step toward
the commission of a crime.

531
00:23:20,742 --> 00:23:22,375
He was on Liberty Island with a bomb.

532
00:23:22,411 --> 00:23:23,643
Then why was the plan always to wait

533
00:23:23,678 --> 00:23:24,844
to arrest him until he got to the crown?

534
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:28,447
Because that's what you thought
you needed to prove attempt.

535
00:23:28,483 --> 00:23:30,182
They're young. They're hungry.
They're smart.

536
00:23:30,218 --> 00:23:32,551
Let them fight it out. Are we done here?

537
00:23:32,587 --> 00:23:34,687
No. We're not done.

538
00:23:35,355 --> 00:23:36,990
Oh, right.

539
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,866
Yankees tickets?

540
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:49,535
Third-base line.

541
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,672
You're going to the game with him?

542
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,571
We don't go together. We meet there.

543
00:23:52,607 --> 00:23:54,406
Sometimes we go together.

544
00:23:54,442 --> 00:23:55,474
He's the enemy.

545
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,075
No, the Red Sox are the enemy.

546
00:23:57,111 --> 00:23:58,477
He's the adversary.

547
00:23:58,513 --> 00:24:00,578
So we came to pick up tickets?
That's what we were doing here?

548
00:24:00,614 --> 00:24:01,513
You weren't watching.

549
00:24:01,548 --> 00:24:03,015
They now think you're gonna
argue attempt,

550
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,582
and they're gonna direct
a lot of resources

551
00:24:04,618 --> 00:24:06,551
in that direction, but that's a loser.

552
00:24:06,586 --> 00:24:08,386
This is an entrapment case,

553
00:24:08,421 --> 00:24:10,989
so make sure you have one.

554
00:24:11,025 --> 00:24:13,224
I'm going to trial.

555
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,093
You're going to trial, Sandra.

556
00:24:27,928 --> 00:24:29,996
She was here first.

557
00:24:30,031 --> 00:24:31,230
I owe you one.

558
00:24:31,265 --> 00:24:34,199
Spicy lamb, cumin hand-pulled noodles.

559
00:24:34,234 --> 00:24:35,767
I'll have that, too.

560
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,193
Is that the thing to get?

561
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:41,339
No idea, but it's two blocks
from the courthouse,

562
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:42,608
and it's lamb.

563
00:24:45,412 --> 00:24:48,046
You know you're part of an
important tradition in my life.

564
00:24:48,081 --> 00:24:49,515
I'm going to trial tomorrow,

565
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:52,083
and my tradition is now to eat with you

566
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:54,719
at Hand-Pulled Noodle House Number 3

567
00:24:54,754 --> 00:24:57,555
every night before
the first day of trial.

568
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,024
Can you commit to that?

569
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:01,926
My dad took me to Frimple's Diner

570
00:25:01,961 --> 00:25:03,495
before every high-school swim meet.

571
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,497
I like a tradition.

572
00:25:07,394 --> 00:25:08,860
Yes.

573
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:16,135
- Are you nervous?
- Is it that spicy?

574
00:25:16,342 --> 00:25:18,543
The trial.
Are you nervous about the trial?

575
00:25:18,578 --> 00:25:20,277
No.

576
00:25:20,312 --> 00:25:21,712
I'm not.

577
00:25:22,629 --> 00:25:23,878
I'm gonna win.

578
00:25:24,874 --> 00:25:26,408
That's what I'd be nervous about.

579
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:01,108
Please tell the jury
what happened that morning.

580
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,377
Well, I saw this young man
come off the ferry,

581
00:26:03,412 --> 00:26:04,611
carrying a camera.

582
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,847
He was sweating, jittery.

583
00:26:06,882 --> 00:26:08,215
I asked to see his camera,

584
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,051
and that's when I realized
it was... a bomb.

585
00:26:11,087 --> 00:26:13,487
A fake bomb made by the FBI.

586
00:26:13,522 --> 00:26:15,154
I didn't know that at the time.

587
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,557
Were you aware at the time that,
in addition to making fake bombs,

588
00:26:17,593 --> 00:26:20,460
the FBI had been recruiting
Mr. Fayed for 18 months?

589
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,095
- No, ma'am.
- That he has no history of violence?

590
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,464
No history of terrorist affiliation?

591
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,566
That the government
has no evidence indicating

592
00:26:26,602 --> 00:26:28,401
he's ever had any interest in terrorism

593
00:26:28,436 --> 00:26:31,037
prior to his being recruited
by this team of agents?

594
00:26:31,072 --> 00:26:32,505
No, ma'am.

595
00:26:35,576 --> 00:26:38,244
You're not arguing attempt.
You're arguing entrapment.

596
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:41,547
Oh. I didn't realize.

597
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,151
- She's relentless.
- Yes, I know.

598
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,084
It's a problem.

599
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,487
No, it's an answer. She likes to fight.

600
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,890
I just need to give her
something else to fight about.

601
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:52,224
Good. Problem solved.

602
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,760
You work on the ferry

603
00:26:54,795 --> 00:26:57,229
taking visitors
to Liberty Island, Mr. Rocton?

604
00:26:57,264 --> 00:26:59,031
Yes, sir. I collect tickets.

605
00:26:59,066 --> 00:27:01,734
Do you recall seeing
the defendant on the ferry

606
00:27:01,769 --> 00:27:03,402
the morning of his arrest?

607
00:27:03,437 --> 00:27:05,203
I remember him well, sir.

608
00:27:09,043 --> 00:27:10,842
What the hell was the point of that?

609
00:27:10,877 --> 00:27:12,411
That.

610
00:27:12,446 --> 00:27:15,013
You remember Mr. Fayed well, sir?

611
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:16,748
- Yes.
- Hmm. Really?

612
00:27:16,783 --> 00:27:18,050
How long have you worked on that ferry?

613
00:27:18,085 --> 00:27:21,252
- 19 years.
- 19 years. And how many ferries a day?

614
00:27:21,287 --> 00:27:22,787
25, 26.

615
00:27:22,822 --> 00:27:25,156
Thousands of ferries, tens
of thousands of visitors,

616
00:27:25,191 --> 00:27:27,705
and you want the jury to believe
that you remember my client?

617
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,857
Not just remember him.

618
00:27:28,883 --> 00:27:30,595
- Remember him well?
- Yes.

619
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,129
Well, unless your memory has been jogged

620
00:27:32,165 --> 00:27:33,798
- by the government, Mr. Rocton...
- Objection!

621
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:35,599
...how could you possibly
remember my client at all?!

622
00:27:35,634 --> 00:27:38,936
Because I quit my job because
of him! That's how!

623
00:27:38,971 --> 00:27:42,540
Because that ferry he was on was
the last ferry I ever worked.

624
00:27:42,575 --> 00:27:46,743
I was down there on 9/11, ma'am.

625
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:49,342
On the island. Right next to her.

626
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:53,584
The idea that someone
would want to blow her up now?

627
00:27:55,688 --> 00:27:57,420
I remember.

628
00:27:59,658 --> 00:28:02,366
You never, ever ask a question
you don't know the answer to.

629
00:28:02,402 --> 00:28:04,006
- That was a mistake.
- The mistake...

630
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:06,063
was getting baited into a fight.

631
00:28:06,098 --> 00:28:08,231
The mistake was asking
any questions at all.

632
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:09,765
- This is war.
- It is.

633
00:28:09,801 --> 00:28:11,278
It is war.

634
00:28:11,313 --> 00:28:13,836
Which means you have
to pick your battles,

635
00:28:13,871 --> 00:28:15,771
point your weapon in the right direction,

636
00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:17,329
and know your enemy.

637
00:28:17,354 --> 00:28:21,557
And right now, your biggest enemy is you.

638
00:28:21,582 --> 00:28:24,316
You want to fight everyone
about everything

639
00:28:24,341 --> 00:28:25,907
and when you fight about everything,

640
00:28:25,932 --> 00:28:27,865
you end up fighting about nothing.

641
00:28:39,497 --> 00:28:41,020
You want me to plead guilty?

642
00:28:41,055 --> 00:28:44,166
No, but I don't want you to go
to jail for years,

643
00:28:44,201 --> 00:28:47,603
which is the risk if we reject
the deal and go to trial.

644
00:28:47,638 --> 00:28:49,505
How could you let this happen?

645
00:29:07,658 --> 00:29:09,090
<i>He's buying the whole thing.</i>

646
00:29:09,126 --> 00:29:10,474
<i> Yeah, everything.</i>
<i>That's what I'm saying.</i>

647
00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:13,628
<i>The Bureau. The technology upgrade.</i>

648
00:29:13,664 --> 00:29:15,530
<i>Yeah, I've gone full
"Primal Fear" on him.</i>

649
00:29:15,565 --> 00:29:17,731
<i> Yeah, this guy's a real tool.</i>

650
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:39,386
I have to take the deal, Sandy.
I've tried everything.

651
00:29:40,188 --> 00:29:42,822
I'm sure there's another move.

652
00:29:42,857 --> 00:29:45,308
The thing is, the deal is good.

653
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,960
Good for who?

654
00:29:48,262 --> 00:29:50,329
For her?

655
00:29:50,364 --> 00:29:51,597
Or for you?

656
00:29:51,632 --> 00:29:52,699
What does that mean?

657
00:29:52,734 --> 00:29:55,267
Six months in jail and a record
as a convicted felon?

658
00:29:55,303 --> 00:29:56,569
That's not good for anyone,

659
00:29:56,604 --> 00:29:58,604
especially a working-class single mother.

660
00:29:58,639 --> 00:30:00,573
Why are you lecturing me?

661
00:30:00,608 --> 00:30:02,874
Look, the only other move is highly risky

662
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:05,611
and ethically questionable,
and it destroys Seth.

663
00:30:05,646 --> 00:30:08,247
I don't just beat him, I destroy him.

664
00:30:08,282 --> 00:30:10,333
It's the nuclear option.

665
00:30:11,244 --> 00:30:13,778
This is hard, okay?

666
00:30:14,315 --> 00:30:15,797
I know.

667
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:19,858
I'm sorry.

668
00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:23,575
Wait. That's it?

669
00:30:23,611 --> 00:30:25,410
You're just gonna let me
off the hook that easy?

670
00:30:25,445 --> 00:30:27,045
No, I don't accept that.

671
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,813
This is where you say,
"If it was anybody but Seth,

672
00:30:28,848 --> 00:30:30,081
I don't think you'd hesitate,"

673
00:30:30,117 --> 00:30:32,950
or, "I like the nuclear option."

674
00:30:36,089 --> 00:30:38,523
What happened in trial today?

675
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:40,425
Something happened in trial today.

676
00:30:41,928 --> 00:30:44,951
I messed up today, Al.

677
00:30:45,398 --> 00:30:48,566
I messed up.

678
00:30:59,478 --> 00:31:02,379
I believe in you, Sandra Bell.

679
00:31:44,794 --> 00:31:47,128
We live in a dangerous time.

680
00:31:48,682 --> 00:31:51,332
I don't need to tell you that.

681
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:53,668
Our enemies used to be overseas,

682
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,837
and we could see them
in tanks and airplanes.

683
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,172
They wore uniforms,

684
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:01,508
and we fought them on battlefields.

685
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:05,312
But now we're living on the battlefield,

686
00:32:05,347 --> 00:32:07,314
and we can't see the enemy.

687
00:32:07,349 --> 00:32:08,715
They look like us.

688
00:32:08,751 --> 00:32:11,844
They talk like us. They live
down the hallway from us.

689
00:32:11,869 --> 00:32:12,968
We only find out who they are

690
00:32:13,003 --> 00:32:16,004
and the damage they want to do
after they've done it.

691
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,973
After they've shot up a nightclub.

692
00:32:18,008 --> 00:32:20,142
Or blown up a marathon.

693
00:32:20,177 --> 00:32:22,340
Or brought down a building.

694
00:32:23,047 --> 00:32:24,780
Or two.

695
00:32:24,815 --> 00:32:27,582
The only chance we have
to fight these enemies

696
00:32:27,618 --> 00:32:28,816
is to find out who they are

697
00:32:28,852 --> 00:32:31,419
before they do these terrible things,

698
00:32:31,455 --> 00:32:33,988
and that's what
these fine agents did here.

699
00:32:34,023 --> 00:32:35,790
They found a dangerous man

700
00:32:35,825 --> 00:32:39,093
who was willing to commit
an unspeakable crime,

701
00:32:39,129 --> 00:32:41,796
and they stopped him.

702
00:32:41,831 --> 00:32:44,299
Ms. Bell wants you to believe
that our government did this.

703
00:32:44,334 --> 00:32:47,001
Ask yourself how much money,
how much time would it take

704
00:32:47,036 --> 00:32:51,739
to convince you to blow the head
off the Statue of Liberty?

705
00:32:54,844 --> 00:33:00,047
"The function of law enforcement
is the prevention of crime

706
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:03,016
and the apprehension of criminals.

707
00:33:03,051 --> 00:33:05,852
Manifestly, that function
does not include

708
00:33:05,888 --> 00:33:08,622
the manufacturing of crime."

709
00:33:08,658 --> 00:33:10,691
Chief Justice of the United States

710
00:33:10,726 --> 00:33:13,360
Earl Warren wrote that 60 years ago

711
00:33:13,396 --> 00:33:15,896
in a case that came out
of this very courtroom,

712
00:33:15,931 --> 00:33:17,364
decided by a jury sitting

713
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,800
in the same seats
you're sitting in today.

714
00:33:19,835 --> 00:33:22,836
That man is not a criminal,

715
00:33:22,871 --> 00:33:25,238
and law enforcement
prevented no crime here.

716
00:33:25,274 --> 00:33:27,140
They manufactured a crime.

717
00:33:27,176 --> 00:33:29,042
Instead of hunting actual terrorists,

718
00:33:29,077 --> 00:33:31,978
your government tried
to make a terrorist.

719
00:33:32,014 --> 00:33:35,381
They contacted him. They befriended him.

720
00:33:35,417 --> 00:33:37,624
They trained him.

721
00:33:38,252 --> 00:33:40,986
They picked a target for him.
They built a bomb for him.

722
00:33:41,022 --> 00:33:42,822
<i>They</i> made<i> him.</i>

723
00:33:47,195 --> 00:33:51,396
This is Mohammed Fayed.

724
00:33:51,432 --> 00:33:55,901
<i>This</i> is Mohammed Fayed.

725
00:33:55,937 --> 00:33:58,704
And<i> that</i> is what<i> they</i> made.

726
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:04,176
It's easy to become distracted
in a case like this.

727
00:34:04,212 --> 00:34:07,946
To become emotional.
To focus on the wrong things.

728
00:34:07,981 --> 00:34:11,850
But this case is about one thing
and one thing only.

729
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:14,919
It is about the power of
the United States government

730
00:34:14,955 --> 00:34:18,957
being used to systematically
target and manipulate

731
00:34:18,992 --> 00:34:21,092
and incarcerate American citizens

732
00:34:21,127 --> 00:34:24,795
because of their religion,
their ethnicity,

733
00:34:24,831 --> 00:34:28,132
their national origin, their color.

734
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:31,261
It is an awesome power.

735
00:34:32,005 --> 00:34:35,273
But what you have today
is even more powerful.

736
00:34:35,308 --> 00:34:39,543
You have the power to say no.
You have the power to resist.

737
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,945
In this courthouse, in this courtroom,

738
00:34:41,981 --> 00:34:43,881
in those seats today,

739
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:47,318
you have the awesome power of justice...

740
00:34:48,788 --> 00:34:50,821
and there's nothing
more powerful than that.

741
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:02,266
I understand that the parties
have reached a deal.

742
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:03,267
Is that correct?

743
00:35:03,302 --> 00:35:04,544
Yes.

744
00:35:12,144 --> 00:35:13,610
No, Your Honor.

745
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:14,811
Allison?

746
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:17,346
I have firsthand knowledge
that the AUSA handling the case

747
00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:20,016
filed the additional claims
in the superseding indictment

748
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:22,985
for the sole purpose of pressuring Ms.
Locarno into a deal...

749
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:24,987
- The AUSA handling the case?
- ...which is an ethical violation.

750
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:27,791
That's me. What are you doing?
That was a personal conversation.

751
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:29,258
Oh, I thought it was business.

752
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,894
Mr. Oliver. Is this true?

753
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:34,964
I'll keep it off the record

754
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:36,698
if you dismiss the case
against Ms. Locarno.

755
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:37,833
I can't do that.

756
00:35:37,868 --> 00:35:40,136
Then I'll expedite a ruling
on the motion to dismiss.

757
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:42,771
The case is going away
either way, young man.

758
00:35:59,055 --> 00:36:01,456
A 64-month sentence?

759
00:36:01,491 --> 00:36:02,573
That's five years?

760
00:36:02,609 --> 00:36:05,660
He's a habitual, unrepentant con man.
He's ruined lives.

761
00:36:05,695 --> 00:36:08,863
He's a flawed human being who's
tricked money out of businesses.

762
00:36:08,898 --> 00:36:11,131
Prison isn't the answer for everything.
Have some compassion.

763
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:13,067
I have compassion for people
who follow the rules.

764
00:36:13,102 --> 00:36:16,003
Did you ever break a rule?
In your whole life?

765
00:36:16,038 --> 00:36:18,038
For which you didn't pay
the appropriate price?

766
00:36:18,074 --> 00:36:19,573
Has that ever happened?

767
00:36:19,608 --> 00:36:22,809
Did you ever get the benefit
of compassion and generosity

768
00:36:22,845 --> 00:36:24,979
for mistakes that you made?

769
00:36:25,014 --> 00:36:28,849
Did mercy and kindness
ever change your path?

770
00:36:31,219 --> 00:36:33,987
You could be a good lawyer.

771
00:36:34,022 --> 00:36:36,055
If you tried. You're just not trying.

772
00:36:44,966 --> 00:36:48,234
In the case of United States vs.
Mohammed Fayed,

773
00:36:48,269 --> 00:36:51,904
we the jury find the
defendant, Mohammed Fayed,

774
00:36:51,939 --> 00:36:55,041
guilty of one count
of attempted use of a weapon

775
00:36:55,076 --> 00:36:56,942
of mass destruction.

776
00:37:21,635 --> 00:37:23,201
Hand-Pulled Noodle House Number 3.

777
00:37:24,338 --> 00:37:25,937
You're not celebrating.

778
00:37:25,972 --> 00:37:29,707
Oh, I don't celebrate people
going to jail.

779
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:37,114
You, uh... Do you mind if I sit here?

780
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:56,133
I'm on probation.

781
00:37:58,671 --> 00:38:00,137
I'm sorry.

782
00:38:00,173 --> 00:38:02,073
I'm sorry...

783
00:38:02,108 --> 00:38:03,174
but you know what?

784
00:38:03,209 --> 00:38:06,643
I'm not sorry. At all.
Because I was just doing my job.

785
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:08,946
- I did what I had to do.
- Right.

786
00:38:08,981 --> 00:38:11,014
And now I'm gonna do what I have to do.

787
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:13,249
I'm leaving.

788
00:38:13,285 --> 00:38:14,918
You're not leaving.

789
00:38:16,321 --> 00:38:21,257
I. Am. Leaving.

790
00:38:21,293 --> 00:38:23,826
I'm leaving.

791
00:38:30,135 --> 00:38:32,935
I told you you were gonna lose.

792
00:38:32,971 --> 00:38:34,804
I told you.

793
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:37,039
This isn't TV.

794
00:38:37,075 --> 00:38:39,441
You don't get a Muslim-American kid off

795
00:38:39,477 --> 00:38:41,944
charged with trying to blow up
the Statue of Liberty.

796
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,879
You're going up against the government,

797
00:38:43,915 --> 00:38:47,516
the culture, the media,
everything, and everybody.

798
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:51,186
The question is, what do you do now?

799
00:38:51,222 --> 00:38:53,856
Because now I'm Salomon Torres.

800
00:38:55,993 --> 00:38:58,227
May 25, 1951.

801
00:38:58,262 --> 00:38:59,727
A promising 20-year-old rookie

802
00:38:59,762 --> 00:39:02,464
starts for the then
New York Giants in center field.

803
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,467
He goes 0-5 in his first game.

804
00:39:05,503 --> 00:39:08,537
0-3 in his second game.
0-4 in his third game.

805
00:39:08,572 --> 00:39:09,704
He can't hit.

806
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,506
He cries in front of his manager.

807
00:39:11,541 --> 00:39:13,307
His manager tells him to go home

808
00:39:13,343 --> 00:39:15,043
and come back and play tomorrow.

809
00:39:15,078 --> 00:39:18,923
Next game, first inning,
he hits a home run.

810
00:39:19,716 --> 00:39:22,017
And then he doesn't stop.

811
00:39:22,052 --> 00:39:23,217
Willie Mays.

812
00:39:23,253 --> 00:39:25,854
The greatest baseball player of all time.

813
00:39:25,889 --> 00:39:28,224
I do follow baseball.

814
00:39:29,859 --> 00:39:31,526
Then you know, Sandra, the first game

815
00:39:31,561 --> 00:39:34,195
doesn't always tell you
where you're gonna end up.

816
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:40,067
- What did I get?
- What?

817
00:39:40,102 --> 00:39:43,171
You said, on the first day,
"Get something."

818
00:39:43,206 --> 00:39:45,839
What did I get today?

819
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:47,618
You got beat.

820
00:39:48,744 --> 00:39:50,443
And now you got to get up.

821
00:40:44,765 --> 00:40:47,266
Where's Seth?

822
00:40:47,301 --> 00:40:51,203
I have no boyfriend today.
And Seth has no girlfriend.

823
00:40:52,973 --> 00:40:54,852
Al...

824
00:40:55,943 --> 00:40:57,275
I'm sorry.

825
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:02,180
All right. Come on.

826
00:41:02,216 --> 00:41:04,116
Come on. I want to show you something.

827
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:08,152
You know, I've lived
in New York half my life,

828
00:41:08,187 --> 00:41:09,787
and I've never walked across this bridge.

829
00:41:09,822 --> 00:41:12,523
Well, I grew up in Sacramento
and never went

830
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:14,659
to the California State Railroad Museum.

831
00:41:14,694 --> 00:41:17,416
So, I totally understand.

832
00:41:18,331 --> 00:41:19,930
I want you to stay with me, Sandra.

833
00:41:19,966 --> 00:41:21,065
Live with me in the apartment.

834
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,934
I know we said it was temporary
until you found a place,

835
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,669
but I want you to live there.

836
00:41:25,704 --> 00:41:26,764
And don't say you can't afford it,

837
00:41:26,799 --> 00:41:30,007
because it's my parents
and it's free, okay?

838
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:34,044
We have to do this together.

839
00:41:35,882 --> 00:41:37,714
I don't want to do it any other way.

840
00:41:39,585 --> 00:41:42,185
Okay. Stop.

841
00:41:43,355 --> 00:41:45,188
Ready? Turn around.

842
00:41:46,525 --> 00:41:47,691
There it is.

843
00:41:47,726 --> 00:41:49,159
Right here.

844
00:41:49,194 --> 00:41:50,294
See it?

845
00:41:50,329 --> 00:41:51,361
The Mother Court.

846
00:41:53,198 --> 00:41:54,498
Are we worthy?

847
00:41:55,867 --> 00:41:58,067
Yes, I think so.

848
00:41:58,103 --> 00:41:59,302
- We are.
- We are worthy.

849
00:41:59,337 --> 00:42:00,970
- We're so worthy.
- Who is worthier than us?

850
00:42:01,006 --> 00:42:02,972
- Aaron Burr?
- Please.

851
00:42:04,609 --> 00:42:05,675
We are worthy.

852
00:42:18,907 --> 00:42:24,093

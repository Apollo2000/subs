1
00:00:00,407 --> 00:00:02,386
Previously on "For the People"...

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,427
Damn!

3
00:00:04,461 --> 00:00:06,606
I can cancel my date tonight
and work on this with you.

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,107
I don't want you to cancel your date.

5
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:10,333
I'll be thinking about you
the whole time.

6
00:00:10,367 --> 00:00:12,335
It's about opposing counsel.
She's my girlfriend.

7
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:13,869
The AUSA handling the case

8
00:00:13,904 --> 00:00:16,205
filed the additional claims
for the sole purpose

9
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,974
of pressuring Ms. Locarno into a deal.

10
00:00:18,008 --> 00:00:19,976
- I'm on probation.
- I did what I had to do.

11
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,021
And now I'm gonna do
what I have to do. I'm leaving.

12
00:00:22,045 --> 00:00:23,323
- Good morning.
- Not for you, apparently.

13
00:00:23,347 --> 00:00:24,524
We were just talking about losers.

14
00:00:24,548 --> 00:00:26,693
My case was thrown out.
Can we really call that a loss?

15
00:00:26,717 --> 00:00:27,883
We can call it a big loss.

16
00:00:27,918 --> 00:00:30,319
We are not going to break up
over an insidertrading case.

17
00:00:30,354 --> 00:00:31,531
No, we're gonna break up because

18
00:00:31,555 --> 00:00:33,889
I don't want to be second chair
to you the rest of my life.

19
00:00:33,924 --> 00:00:35,958
And if I stay,
we both know that I would be.

20
00:01:02,252 --> 00:01:03,652
Hey.

21
00:01:06,123 --> 00:01:07,156
There he is.

22
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,157
Hey, Mom!

23
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:09,158
You're all moved in.

24
00:01:09,192 --> 00:01:12,061
Yep, feels like home.

25
00:01:12,095 --> 00:01:13,996
- This is the best thing for you.
- Don't.

26
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:15,231
- What?
- Bring Allison up.

27
00:01:15,265 --> 00:01:18,203
I wasn't. I'm just proud
that you have your own place.

28
00:01:18,237 --> 00:01:19,163
Thanks, Mom.

29
00:01:19,197 --> 00:01:20,903
- Without Allison.
- Mom...

30
00:01:20,937 --> 00:01:22,204
Can you believe what's going on

31
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:23,506
- over here in Lincoln?
- What?

32
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,175
You know the aerospace plant
that went in a few years back?

33
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:29,045
KapplerHays, yeah?
They've been allowing some chemical

34
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:30,279
to run off their property,

35
00:01:30,313 --> 00:01:33,949
and, apparently, it's in
the soil, the drinking water.

36
00:01:33,984 --> 00:01:35,751
People are getting really sick.

37
00:01:35,786 --> 00:01:37,520
Is that Carver?

38
00:01:37,554 --> 00:01:39,555
Your elementary school.

39
00:01:39,589 --> 00:01:41,023
Remember Jenny Mars?

40
00:01:41,058 --> 00:01:42,138
Of course I remember Jenny.

41
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,263
That's her son, Theo, in the picture.

42
00:01:47,297 --> 00:01:49,532
He's on life support.

43
00:01:49,566 --> 00:01:50,766
You're a lawyer.

44
00:01:50,801 --> 00:01:52,401
Can you do something about all this?

45
00:01:52,436 --> 00:01:53,869
I'm not that kind of lawyer, Mom.

46
00:01:53,904 --> 00:01:55,538
Well, what kind of lawyer are you?

47
00:02:10,654 --> 00:02:11,754
Hey.

48
00:02:11,788 --> 00:02:13,583
- You biked here?
- Yeah. You?

49
00:02:14,724 --> 00:02:16,258
I thought I'd beat her here.

50
00:02:16,293 --> 00:02:17,670
I saw her at home in the morning once.

51
00:02:17,694 --> 00:02:19,295
That was the closest I've come.

52
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:22,042
Chloe Daniels, assault on
a postal worker...

53
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:23,099
I'll take it.

54
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:24,444
Have you ever done a murder case?

55
00:02:24,468 --> 00:02:25,468
YYou said "assault."

56
00:02:25,502 --> 00:02:27,570
He might die. Allison? Jay?

57
00:02:27,604 --> 00:02:30,239
Not a lot of murder at the ACLU.
Lot of talking, mostly.

58
00:02:30,273 --> 00:02:33,109
AAt County PD, I had guys who
probably had murdered, so...

59
00:02:33,143 --> 00:02:35,478
This one's mine then. Assist and learn.

60
00:02:35,512 --> 00:02:38,247
What exactly did Chloe Daniels do?

61
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:42,451
I was getting my mail.
Just like a normal day.

62
00:02:42,486 --> 00:02:44,153
He was already in the mail room.

63
00:02:44,187 --> 00:02:45,421
Were you alone?

64
00:02:45,455 --> 00:02:47,423
It wasn't Stanley, our normal mail guy.

65
00:02:47,457 --> 00:02:50,459
This guys was... weird.

66
00:02:50,494 --> 00:02:52,261
He was, um...

67
00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:54,163
looking at me...

68
00:02:54,197 --> 00:02:56,571
Yeah, it was just the two of us.

69
00:02:56,598 --> 00:02:59,967
Before I could even open the mailbox,

70
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:01,302
he came at me.

71
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:08,575
So II grabbed a letter opener
off the counter.

72
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,344
Really, the next thing I can remember

73
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:13,614
is him bleeding from his neck.

74
00:03:13,648 --> 00:03:16,250
And then I called the police.

75
00:03:16,284 --> 00:03:19,153
I've never hurt anyone
in my life, Ms. Carlan.

76
00:03:19,187 --> 00:03:21,488
I was just trying to defend myself.

77
00:03:21,523 --> 00:03:23,590
And I'm here to defend you, Chloe.

78
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,694
A plea of not guilty is entered

79
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:27,905
as to all counts of the indictment.

80
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:30,664
Our next order of business
is assigning a judge for trial.

81
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:31,799
Ms. Krissman?

82
00:03:34,202 --> 00:03:36,470
The Honorable Judge Gerald McKinnon.

83
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:40,174
The Honorable Judge Eva Corcoran.

84
00:03:42,077 --> 00:03:44,345
The Honorable Judge Nicholas Byrne.

85
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:46,113
My client has no criminal record,

86
00:03:46,147 --> 00:03:49,116
she isn't a flight risk,
and has roots in the community.

87
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,118
We respectfully ask for bond

88
00:03:51,152 --> 00:03:53,153
in an amount commensurate
with her resources.

89
00:03:53,188 --> 00:03:54,822
Under the condition that Ms. Daniels

90
00:03:54,856 --> 00:03:57,391
confine herself to her home
except for the purposes of work,

91
00:03:57,425 --> 00:03:59,226
bail is set for $20,000.

92
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,061
Now, let's pick a trial judge.

93
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:13,640
MMaybe just pull a card, Ms. Krissman?

94
00:04:14,943 --> 00:04:16,310
How bad is it?

95
00:04:18,113 --> 00:04:19,190
We may have to put her down.

96
00:04:19,214 --> 00:04:21,315
That's sad.

97
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:24,485
I remember the first time on the
Wheel, I got Judge Wallace Andrews.

98
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,753
- Yuck.
- Deeply unpleasant.

99
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:28,689
But then he ruled for me on an
impossible suppression motion.

100
00:04:28,723 --> 00:04:31,592
Still remember that.
Never doubt the Wheel.

101
00:04:31,626 --> 00:04:33,160
First of all, who even thinks about

102
00:04:33,194 --> 00:04:35,996
running a pipeline
full of poison next to a school?

103
00:04:36,031 --> 00:04:37,698
TThe school is already right there.

104
00:04:37,732 --> 00:04:40,000
It's not... an invisible school.

105
00:04:40,035 --> 00:04:41,545
I found it every morning for six years.

106
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:42,613
It's hard to ask you to leave

107
00:04:42,637 --> 00:04:44,838
when you're using the words
"poison" and "school."

108
00:04:44,873 --> 00:04:47,107
- I'm angry.
- You should be.

109
00:04:47,142 --> 00:04:48,686
And they're probably
gonna get away with this.

110
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,178
If only you knew someone
in the federal justice system

111
00:04:51,212 --> 00:04:52,646
who could do something about it.

112
00:04:53,982 --> 00:04:55,092
KapplerHays has already committed

113
00:04:55,116 --> 00:04:57,117
so many EPA violations here...

114
00:04:57,152 --> 00:04:59,787
Clean Water Act,
Toxic Substances Control Act...

115
00:04:59,821 --> 00:05:02,299
Doesn't Nebraska have an attorney
general and courts and stuff?

116
00:05:02,323 --> 00:05:03,257
I'm not up on Nebraska.

117
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,359
Nebraska depends on
KapplerHays for jobs.

118
00:05:05,393 --> 00:05:07,461
The attorney general's
never gonna go hard at them.

119
00:05:07,495 --> 00:05:09,596
But their headquarters
are here in Manhattan,

120
00:05:09,631 --> 00:05:11,465
so we can get them
in the Southern District.

121
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:12,533
It's a big case to make.

122
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:15,269
It is. But the EPA
and state regulatory authorities

123
00:05:15,303 --> 00:05:16,937
have already done so much to make it.

124
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:18,499
We just need to pull it all together.

125
00:05:20,008 --> 00:05:22,309
You look like Seth Oliver.
Even sound like him.

126
00:05:22,343 --> 00:05:23,444
Let me do this.

127
00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:26,246
Yeah, but I can't use resources
on a case we can't win.

128
00:05:26,281 --> 00:05:27,915
I'm not Rocky Balboa.

129
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:30,451
Rocky did win. He beat Ivan Drago.

130
00:05:30,485 --> 00:05:32,753
I meant the first one.

131
00:05:32,787 --> 00:05:35,289
He just wants to go the dist... Wait.

132
00:05:37,192 --> 00:05:39,326
You've seen "Rocky IV",
but not the original?

133
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,161
- Four is a classic.
- It's four!

134
00:05:41,196 --> 00:05:43,964
Let me do this. I can win.

135
00:05:43,998 --> 00:05:45,799
Okay, but on the condition

136
00:05:45,834 --> 00:05:48,235
that you rent "Rocky"... the first one...

137
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:51,238
and tell me if there's
a better movie anywhere.

138
00:05:51,272 --> 00:05:52,706
That's literally a condition!

139
00:05:54,175 --> 00:05:56,110
- Cool if I sit?
- No.

140
00:05:56,144 --> 00:05:58,345
So, here's the scenario.
Let's say you embezzled...

141
00:05:58,379 --> 00:05:59,046
I would never embezzle.

142
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,124
- But if you did.
- I didn't.

143
00:06:00,148 --> 00:06:02,416
- What would you spend the money on?
- What money?

144
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,128
- The money you embezzled.
- I didn't embezzle.

145
00:06:04,152 --> 00:06:05,352
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

146
00:06:05,386 --> 00:06:06,653
I finished the discovery binder

147
00:06:06,688 --> 00:06:07,965
for the Stewart International case.

148
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:09,469
Thanks, Tony. You can leave it there.

149
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,527
You got any big plans for the weekend?

150
00:06:13,561 --> 00:06:15,229
Going through this.

151
00:06:16,197 --> 00:06:18,008
If you need a break,
a bunch of us are going over

152
00:06:18,032 --> 00:06:20,367
to the Jazz Age Lawn Party
on Governors Island.

153
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:21,531
You should come.

154
00:06:24,506 --> 00:06:26,673
I probably won't have time,
but thanks for the invite.

155
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:30,644
Okay, well, if anything changes,
you have my number.

156
00:06:35,383 --> 00:06:37,618
- That was real cold.
- What?

157
00:06:37,652 --> 00:06:39,386
He likes you. He sent up a test balloon

158
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,688
and you shot it down. Cold.

159
00:06:41,723 --> 00:06:43,357
II'm not interested.

160
00:06:44,859 --> 00:06:46,237
- If you were interested...
- I'm not!

161
00:06:46,261 --> 00:06:47,394
- But if...
- I'm...

162
00:06:47,428 --> 00:06:49,329
I have to move floors.

163
00:06:49,364 --> 00:06:50,397
I did it.

164
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:52,209
Opened a criminal investigation
into KapplerHays.

165
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:53,100
Subpoenas are out.

166
00:06:53,134 --> 00:06:54,801
You're going up against KapplerHays?

167
00:06:54,836 --> 00:06:56,370
You both have offices, right?

168
00:06:56,404 --> 00:06:57,905
You know every big firm in New York

169
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:59,316
is trying to get that case now, right?

170
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,208
Right now. As we speak.

171
00:07:01,242 --> 00:07:02,509
And the firm that does get it

172
00:07:02,544 --> 00:07:04,211
is gonna spare no expense to destroy you,

173
00:07:04,245 --> 00:07:05,928
and they will salt the earth
when they are done.

174
00:07:05,952 --> 00:07:06,999
Is this a pep talk?

175
00:07:07,024 --> 00:07:08,864
I just want you to know
what you're up against.

176
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:14,869
I think I do know.

177
00:07:15,056 --> 00:07:17,324
- Todd.
- Seth.

178
00:07:17,358 --> 00:07:19,426
- How are you?
- Great. Thanks for coming.

179
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,328
Thanks for, inviting me.

180
00:07:21,362 --> 00:07:23,997
- We miss you at the firm, Seth.
- Well, I miss being there.

181
00:07:24,032 --> 00:07:25,417
You should.

182
00:07:25,452 --> 00:07:27,411
I mean, you have the best job
in the world, obviously,

183
00:07:27,435 --> 00:07:28,612
but there's a lot of great stuff

184
00:07:28,636 --> 00:07:30,003
happening at Stillman right now.

185
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:31,905
- We have nap pods.
- Nap pods?

186
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,674
I just woke up 15 minutes ago.

187
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,442
Can you tell I was asleep?

188
00:07:35,476 --> 00:07:37,077
Look at me. Seriously. Can you tell?

189
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,380
II guess... aa little bit.

190
00:07:40,415 --> 00:07:42,916
- Maybe around your eyes.
- No, you cannot! Right?

191
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:44,271
That's what I'm saying.

192
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:45,752
These things are amazing.

193
00:07:45,787 --> 00:07:47,888
We have a whole
onsite wellness center.

194
00:07:47,922 --> 00:07:48,822
It makes a difference.

195
00:07:48,856 --> 00:07:50,624
Meditation and bee pollen every morning

196
00:07:50,658 --> 00:07:51,925
means less partners screaming.

197
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,527
I heard you made partner.

198
00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:55,395
In record time.

199
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,097
Three years in the Southern District

200
00:07:57,131 --> 00:07:58,532
doing your job, and they minted me.

201
00:07:58,566 --> 00:08:00,400
And it'll probably be even faster for you

202
00:08:00,435 --> 00:08:03,237
because you already have
your first client lined up.

203
00:08:03,271 --> 00:08:05,806
Let me guess. KapplerHays.

204
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,474
You didn't need to guess.

205
00:08:07,508 --> 00:08:09,443
You're smart. And they're smart.

206
00:08:09,477 --> 00:08:11,445
For hiring the former firm
of the prosecutor.

207
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:13,480
Former firm. Future firm.

208
00:08:13,514 --> 00:08:15,048
Yes. It's smart.

209
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,827
Listen, you're gonna be
surprised to hear this,

210
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:19,219
but I'm glad you put
pressure on KapplerHays

211
00:08:19,254 --> 00:08:20,921
by opening this investigation.

212
00:08:20,955 --> 00:08:23,323
It was the right thing to do.
They know they messed up.

213
00:08:23,358 --> 00:08:26,493
The CEO, Jack Lewis,
is personall overseeing

214
00:08:26,527 --> 00:08:28,895
the creation of a $50million health fund

215
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,031
for any affected child in Lincoln.

216
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:33,166
I ordered you the chop.

217
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:36,470
They're also putting in
new inspection protocols,

218
00:08:36,504 --> 00:08:40,407
reforming the entire system
of safety measures companywide,

219
00:08:40,441 --> 00:08:43,176
beyond anything the Nebraska AG
and EPA are asking.

220
00:08:43,211 --> 00:08:45,479
And that's because of you.

221
00:08:45,513 --> 00:08:48,282
Look, we're technically
across the table here,

222
00:08:48,316 --> 00:08:49,716
but we all want the same thing.

223
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:53,487
Okay, so here's what we do.

224
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:55,622
Let's make a deal that gives you a win

225
00:08:55,657 --> 00:08:57,291
and gets the company on the right track,

226
00:08:57,325 --> 00:08:59,436
and, most importantly, gets
the community taken care of...

227
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,494
your community.

228
00:09:00,528 --> 00:09:02,462
My only ask in all of this

229
00:09:02,497 --> 00:09:06,867
is just don't jump the gun
and file charges.

230
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:09,102
Because that would be
unproductive right now.

231
00:09:09,137 --> 00:09:10,604
For the good people of Lincoln.

232
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:12,939
For you. And the firm.
For you and the firm.

233
00:09:12,974 --> 00:09:14,675
I know you know how this works.

234
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:17,177
I know the kind of lawyer you are, Seth.

235
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:29,446
- Dead as a doornail.
- Good.

236
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,514
Remind me not to let you
write my obituary.

237
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:33,650
Hey, we had an agreement. It breaks...

238
00:09:33,684 --> 00:09:34,818
We go automated, I know.

239
00:09:34,852 --> 00:09:37,854
I've got IT installing the
random selection software now.

240
00:09:37,888 --> 00:09:38,988
By the end of the day,

241
00:09:39,023 --> 00:09:42,692
I will be assigning judges
with the push of a button.

242
00:09:42,726 --> 00:09:44,727
Welcome to the 20th century.

243
00:09:47,331 --> 00:09:49,966
No, you can leave it here.
My clerks will get rid of it.

244
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,234
I'll take care of it.

245
00:09:51,268 --> 00:09:53,636
II could really use the firewood.

246
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:03,079
We need to talk to you about Chloe.

247
00:10:03,113 --> 00:10:04,581
- Is she here?
- Not yet.

248
00:10:04,615 --> 00:10:06,416
She's late. Have you tried calling her?

249
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,918
She doesn't live in that building.

250
00:10:08,953 --> 00:10:10,146
What are you talking about?

251
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,888
She told you she lived in that building.

252
00:10:11,922 --> 00:10:13,823
She said she was checking her mail,

253
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:14,891
like she does every day.

254
00:10:14,925 --> 00:10:16,926
She hasn't lived in that
building for four years.

255
00:10:16,961 --> 00:10:18,061
Maybe I misunderstood.

256
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:20,207
She told you that she was
the one who called the police,

257
00:10:20,231 --> 00:10:21,598
but it was actually the doorman.

258
00:10:21,632 --> 00:10:22,676
We need to get her in here.

259
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,767
There are other inconsistencies
with her story.

260
00:10:24,802 --> 00:10:26,936
Chloe?

261
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:29,572
I ccan't...

262
00:10:29,607 --> 00:10:31,040
- Are you okay?
- I don't know.

263
00:10:31,075 --> 00:10:32,208
Where are you?

264
00:10:32,243 --> 00:10:34,577
I will come to you, but you have
to tell me where you are.

265
00:10:34,612 --> 00:10:35,845
I just went for a walk,

266
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,380
and I must've gotten turned around...

267
00:10:37,414 --> 00:10:39,048
Can you... Can you look for a sign?

268
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:42,619
Chloe, you need to tell me
where in Penn Station you are.

269
00:10:42,653 --> 00:10:45,054
Chloe? Chloe?

270
00:10:47,892 --> 00:10:49,192
Chloe.

271
00:10:51,762 --> 00:10:52,762
Chloe!

272
00:10:54,498 --> 00:10:55,765
You're here.

273
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,734
Are you her sister?

274
00:10:57,768 --> 00:10:59,702
What? No.

275
00:10:59,737 --> 00:11:01,304
You should take her home.

276
00:11:01,338 --> 00:11:03,473
She tried to jump in front of a train.

277
00:11:20,824 --> 00:11:22,492
This is distracting.

278
00:11:22,526 --> 00:11:23,927
- What?
- You.

279
00:11:23,961 --> 00:11:25,051
I'm not doing anything.

280
00:11:25,086 --> 00:11:26,963
You're brooding. I don't like it.

281
00:11:26,997 --> 00:11:28,831
I need to talk to someone.

282
00:11:28,866 --> 00:11:31,668
At least it's not in my
office. I have five minutes.

283
00:11:31,702 --> 00:11:33,912
Not you. I'm sorry.

284
00:11:33,947 --> 00:11:35,772
God. Don't be sorry.

285
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:43,846
You called me from your work phone.

286
00:11:43,881 --> 00:11:45,081
I did.

287
00:11:45,115 --> 00:11:46,683
- So, this is about work?
- Yes.

288
00:11:46,717 --> 00:11:48,785
Good.

289
00:11:48,819 --> 00:11:50,753
- This is weird.
- It is.

290
00:11:50,788 --> 00:11:52,589
But you know me better than anyone else,

291
00:11:52,623 --> 00:11:53,823
and I need your advice.

292
00:11:53,857 --> 00:11:55,625
You got one block.

293
00:11:56,727 --> 00:11:58,661
Okay, you know how the plan was

294
00:11:58,696 --> 00:12:01,130
that after a few years
in the U.S. Attorney's Office,

295
00:12:01,165 --> 00:12:02,799
I'd go back to Stillman Pearce,

296
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,834
- but as a partner?
- Yeah.

297
00:12:04,868 --> 00:12:05,919
The company I'm investigating

298
00:12:05,943 --> 00:12:07,280
hired the firm as outside counsel.

299
00:12:07,304 --> 00:12:08,972
And Todd Hardart... Remember him?

300
00:12:09,006 --> 00:12:10,306
- No.
- Really?

301
00:12:10,341 --> 00:12:11,841
I can't even tell what you're saying.

302
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,676
Hardhart? Hardart? I'd remember.

303
00:12:13,711 --> 00:12:16,212
Anyway, he told me that
the company's already agreeing

304
00:12:16,246 --> 00:12:18,982
to do the things I would have asked
them to do if I brought charges,

305
00:12:19,016 --> 00:12:20,383
without me bringing charges.

306
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:22,151
- You believe that?
- I looked into it.

307
00:12:22,186 --> 00:12:24,026
They are. Doing the things
Todd said they were.

308
00:12:24,054 --> 00:12:25,855
Could you get more
if you brought charges?

309
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:27,657
- I don't know.
- You know.

310
00:12:28,726 --> 00:12:31,327
If I file charges,
I think I can get more.

311
00:12:31,362 --> 00:12:33,229
More money. More reforms.

312
00:12:33,263 --> 00:12:34,897
Send a stronger message to the industry

313
00:12:34,932 --> 00:12:36,866
that this is intolerable.

314
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,348
I'll tell you this...

315
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:42,405
if you could stand up to me
and say the things you said,

316
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:43,850
why can't you stand up to a company?

317
00:12:43,874 --> 00:12:45,742
And if it's because it ruins your plan

318
00:12:45,776 --> 00:12:47,644
to be a lawyer at a big, corporate firm,

319
00:12:47,678 --> 00:12:50,613
maybe you should think about
whether that's such a great plan.

320
00:12:51,715 --> 00:12:53,716
One block.

321
00:12:53,751 --> 00:12:56,185
We could do this, you know?

322
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,655
Maybe. Be friends?

323
00:12:59,957 --> 00:13:03,026
You made a choice to be independent.

324
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,028
To be a man.

325
00:13:05,062 --> 00:13:07,030
I am trying my best to respect that.

326
00:13:08,232 --> 00:13:10,700
Don't let them underestimate you, Seth.

327
00:13:10,734 --> 00:13:12,769
Like I did.

328
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:29,218
They spilled poison
near my Annie's school.

329
00:13:29,253 --> 00:13:32,789
Now she has headaches, she gets dizzy,

330
00:13:32,823 --> 00:13:34,791
she's losing her hair.

331
00:13:34,825 --> 00:13:37,860
My boy's seven, and the
doctor says he needs dialysis.

332
00:13:37,895 --> 00:13:40,897
And they keep saying
this was an accident.

333
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:43,933
I'm proud of our commitment
to the environment,

334
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:45,902
to the public health.

335
00:13:45,936 --> 00:13:48,204
For me, it's a sacred trust.

336
00:14:10,994 --> 00:14:12,662
I'm gonna bring criminal charges.

337
00:14:12,696 --> 00:14:14,330
Same suit. Same conversation.

338
00:14:14,364 --> 00:14:16,109
I told you to rent "Rocky",
not "Groundhog Day".

339
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:17,243
I'm gonna bring criminal charges

340
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:20,903
against the CEO of KapplerHays,
Jack Lewis, personally.

341
00:14:20,938 --> 00:14:23,506
- This sounds personal.
- It is personal.

342
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,984
He was the person who made the decisions

343
00:14:25,008 --> 00:14:26,509
that led to these crimes.

344
00:14:26,543 --> 00:14:27,977
The fines are meaningless.

345
00:14:28,011 --> 00:14:30,446
KapplerHays is a $22billion company.

346
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:33,182
$50 million is just another cell
in their accounting software.

347
00:14:33,217 --> 00:14:36,352
The public needs to see
someone go to jail... a person.

348
00:14:36,386 --> 00:14:38,354
That's the only way
to show that we're serious.

349
00:14:38,388 --> 00:14:40,866
- What do you have?
- The EPA interviewed multiple witnesses

350
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,693
who can testify that Jack Lewis
knew about these leaks

351
00:14:43,727 --> 00:14:46,249
and chose not to remediate them
because of cost.

352
00:14:46,284 --> 00:14:47,777
They're gonna want to cut a deal.

353
00:14:47,811 --> 00:14:49,832
Guilty plea. Minimal time. No trial.

354
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:52,135
I'm not looking to try a case
against Stillman Pearce.

355
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:55,338
As long as Lewis does jail time,
I'll cut a deal.

356
00:14:55,372 --> 00:14:58,274
But he needs to go to jail.

357
00:15:09,721 --> 00:15:11,955
I hired a psychiatrist
to do a full evaluation

358
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,067
to see what we're dealing with.

359
00:15:13,091 --> 00:15:15,693
- Where's Sandra?
- Sandra doesn't like hospitals.

360
00:15:15,727 --> 00:15:18,062
- Who likes hospitals?
- It's different with Sandra.

361
00:15:18,096 --> 00:15:19,129
What are we dealing with?

362
00:15:19,164 --> 00:15:21,799
Chloe was on the edge
of the tracks at Penn Station

363
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,033
and speaking incoherently.

364
00:15:23,068 --> 00:15:24,968
She says she gets lost often.

365
00:15:25,003 --> 00:15:27,771
So, we could be dealing with
an insanity defense?

366
00:15:27,806 --> 00:15:29,873
Mental disorder defense. But yes.

367
00:15:29,908 --> 00:15:32,810
I'm sure it explains all of the
inconsistencies in her story.

368
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:34,878
You need to wait for
the psychiatrist's report

369
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:36,157
while I start preparing our papers.

370
00:15:36,181 --> 00:15:37,681
Chloe may need to be committed.

371
00:15:43,021 --> 00:15:44,988
Are you not into guys?
Is that what this is about?

372
00:15:45,023 --> 00:15:47,458
It has nothing to do with gender.

373
00:15:47,492 --> 00:15:49,927
Then is it because
he went to a state school?

374
00:15:49,961 --> 00:15:51,962
I went to a state school.

375
00:15:51,996 --> 00:15:53,931
Nothing wrong with that.

376
00:15:53,965 --> 00:15:55,999
If I went to that
music festival with Tony,

377
00:15:56,034 --> 00:15:57,812
he'd buy me a hot dog,
we'd listen to some bands,

378
00:15:57,836 --> 00:15:59,480
then we'd go back to his place
and we'd have sex.

379
00:15:59,504 --> 00:16:00,971
I don't want that. What's the point?

380
00:16:01,005 --> 00:16:02,606
Of the music festival? I don't know.

381
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,607
Any of it.

382
00:16:03,641 --> 00:16:05,909
Well, some of it could be fun.

383
00:16:05,944 --> 00:16:07,311
I don't want fun.

384
00:16:07,345 --> 00:16:10,781
I want challenging.
Interesting. Stimulating.

385
00:16:10,815 --> 00:16:12,616
Fun is... What your 20s are for.

386
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,617
I'm practically 30.

387
00:16:13,651 --> 00:16:14,662
That's a terrible attitude.

388
00:16:14,686 --> 00:16:16,320
It's the truth.

389
00:16:16,354 --> 00:16:18,589
I'm not saying you have to
get blackout drunk

390
00:16:18,623 --> 00:16:21,091
and wake up on a small boat
in Peru. True story.

391
00:16:21,126 --> 00:16:23,160
You can go out every once in a while.

392
00:16:23,194 --> 00:16:25,028
- With Tony?
- With anybody.

393
00:16:25,063 --> 00:16:27,475
Find somebody you like and send
up a test balloon of your own.

394
00:16:27,499 --> 00:16:30,100
This is sounding a lot
like middle school.

395
00:16:30,135 --> 00:16:32,436
- I hated middle school.
- Everyone hated middle school.

396
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,037
This is different. You're cool now.

397
00:16:34,072 --> 00:16:36,473
You're interesting,
you're smart and attractive...

398
00:16:36,508 --> 00:16:37,808
you're a catch.

399
00:16:37,842 --> 00:16:40,177
I don't want to be caught.

400
00:16:47,852 --> 00:16:49,620
- Nothing?
- The psychiatric testing

401
00:16:49,654 --> 00:16:51,989
showed no mental
or cognitive issues of any kind.

402
00:16:52,023 --> 00:16:53,991
They even did a bunch
of lab work. Nothing.

403
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:55,236
We need to find another doctor.

404
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,727
You said he was the best.

405
00:16:56,761 --> 00:16:57,861
Is it at least possible

406
00:16:57,896 --> 00:16:59,140
she's faking a mental condition?

407
00:16:59,164 --> 00:17:01,285
She almost threw herself in
front of a train.

408
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,351
But she didn't.

409
00:17:02,385 --> 00:17:04,078
Maybe there's some history
with her and this mail carrier.

410
00:17:04,102 --> 00:17:05,716
Maybe there's a whole
different angle on this.

411
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,668
I don't think so.

412
00:17:06,702 --> 00:17:07,815
She lied about everything else.

413
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,216
Why wouldn't she be lying
about this, too?

414
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,141
This isn't a potential
murder case anymore.

415
00:17:11,176 --> 00:17:13,844
The mail carrier is recovering.
One of us can take this now.

416
00:17:13,878 --> 00:17:15,279
I need to talk to Chloe.

417
00:17:17,582 --> 00:17:20,684
Okay, am I, like, missing something here?

418
00:17:20,718 --> 00:17:23,086
Apparently, we all are.

419
00:17:23,121 --> 00:17:25,889
KapplerHays' chairman
and CEO, Jack Lewis,

420
00:17:25,924 --> 00:17:27,208
was arrested today,

421
00:17:27,242 --> 00:17:29,827
charged with multiple criminal violations

422
00:17:29,861 --> 00:17:31,496
of the Clean Water Act...

423
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,565
a highly unusual,
highly personal prosecution

424
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:37,244
that Mr. Lewis's attorneys have indicated

425
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,003
they intend to fight
in every way possible.

426
00:17:40,038 --> 00:17:41,151
- Todd.
- Seth.

427
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,708
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks for... inviting me.

428
00:17:44,742 --> 00:17:46,710
Listen, Todd.

429
00:17:46,744 --> 00:17:49,746
I just want to say,
before we get started,

430
00:17:49,781 --> 00:17:52,118
this isn't personal, obviously.

431
00:17:52,152 --> 00:17:54,918
II have a lot of respect
for you and Stillman.

432
00:17:54,953 --> 00:17:58,422
And I really value
my association with the firm.

433
00:17:58,456 --> 00:18:00,731
- The respect goes both ways, Seth.
- Thank you.

434
00:18:00,765 --> 00:18:02,960
Yeah, seriously. I'm impressed.

435
00:18:02,994 --> 00:18:06,530
This. You. How far you've come.

436
00:18:06,564 --> 00:18:08,687
I was riding up in the elevator just now

437
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:09,721
thinking back to the day

438
00:18:09,746 --> 00:18:11,134
you interviewed here.

439
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:14,438
Roger Gunn calls me
the minute you left the office

440
00:18:14,472 --> 00:18:16,867
and says, "You have to be
kidding me. This guy?"...

441
00:18:16,901 --> 00:18:19,209
meaning you.

442
00:18:19,244 --> 00:18:22,079
And I say, "No. Trust me. He's good."

443
00:18:22,113 --> 00:18:24,581
But Roger's totally
dug in on this... you.

444
00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:26,149
"No way."

445
00:18:26,184 --> 00:18:27,651
More colorful language, obviously.

446
00:18:27,685 --> 00:18:28,752
But he's not budging.

447
00:18:28,786 --> 00:18:30,921
I'm sure you guys
have laughed about this, right?

448
00:18:30,955 --> 00:18:32,256
Ha ha.

449
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:35,292
So, I go back to Ron Stillman
and he's like,

450
00:18:35,326 --> 00:18:37,227
"Well, he can't stay here at the firm.

451
00:18:37,262 --> 00:18:38,328
He's not cutting it."

452
00:18:38,363 --> 00:18:39,663
"He" meaning you.

453
00:18:39,697 --> 00:18:42,900
So, I call Roger
and push and push and beg,

454
00:18:42,934 --> 00:18:45,068
and finally, we get him to take you.

455
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:47,170
My powers of persuasion

456
00:18:47,205 --> 00:18:49,172
and a half dozen box seats
at Yankee Stadium

457
00:18:49,207 --> 00:18:50,507
can move mountains.

458
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:52,609
And now look at you.

459
00:18:52,644 --> 00:18:54,845
Sitting there. Fearless.

460
00:18:54,879 --> 00:18:59,516
You have no future at Stillman
or any top firm in this city.

461
00:18:59,551 --> 00:19:01,952
You have no future in this office.

462
00:19:01,986 --> 00:19:03,244
Roger's not gonna be thrilled

463
00:19:03,278 --> 00:19:05,822
about a guy he didn't want
to hire coming off probation

464
00:19:05,857 --> 00:19:07,624
and getting his head handed to him.

465
00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:09,993
But you don't seem
to care about any of that.

466
00:19:11,796 --> 00:19:13,997
It's... impressive.

467
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:20,170
Anyway, I think you called
me in to make an offer.

468
00:19:22,088 --> 00:19:23,717
I probably should've
said we're not looking

469
00:19:23,741 --> 00:19:25,142
for a deal on this anymore.

470
00:19:25,176 --> 00:19:28,045
We wanted to avoid criminal
charges. This spectacle.

471
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,880
You went ahead anyway,
and now we're feeling

472
00:19:29,914 --> 00:19:32,279
a little less magnanimous.

473
00:19:32,884 --> 00:19:34,284
We'll see you at trial.

474
00:19:49,244 --> 00:19:51,979
Ms. Shore, you were KapplerHays'

475
00:19:52,013 --> 00:19:54,148
Deputy Chief Environmental
Commitment Officer

476
00:19:54,182 --> 00:19:55,883
- for how many years?
- 12 years.

477
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:58,819
On March 9, 2012, did you and Mr. Lewis

478
00:19:58,854 --> 00:20:01,689
discuss the company's facility
in Lincoln, Nebraska?

479
00:20:01,723 --> 00:20:04,058
Yes. We had a big wastewater leak

480
00:20:04,092 --> 00:20:05,492
beneath the Lincoln plant.

481
00:20:05,527 --> 00:20:07,061
Chemicals were leaking into the water,

482
00:20:07,095 --> 00:20:08,227
spreading through the soil.

483
00:20:08,261 --> 00:20:09,830
Right next to Carver Elementary.

484
00:20:09,865 --> 00:20:12,132
I told him that we needed to
make critical upgrades.

485
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:13,543
What did Jack Lewis say

486
00:20:13,577 --> 00:20:15,379
when you told him you need
to make these upgrades?

487
00:20:15,403 --> 00:20:18,239
He said he didn't want to
spend the money.

488
00:20:18,273 --> 00:20:20,263
Do you recognize
this document, Ms. Shore?

489
00:20:20,297 --> 00:20:22,243
It's my mortgage application.

490
00:20:22,277 --> 00:20:23,406
And you swore to tell the truth

491
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,913
under penalty of perjury
on this form, correct?

492
00:20:25,947 --> 00:20:27,147
- Correct.
- Did you?

493
00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:29,717
I misstated my assets.

494
00:20:29,751 --> 00:20:31,485
You lied. Because you wanted something.

495
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:34,154
- Objection. Counsel is testifying...
- Overruled.

496
00:20:34,189 --> 00:20:35,353
Just like you're lying today

497
00:20:35,388 --> 00:20:36,901
so you can avoid being held responsible

498
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:39,860
for alleged environmental crimes
that were in your portfolio.

499
00:20:41,463 --> 00:20:43,097
As head of Intergovernmental Affairs,

500
00:20:43,131 --> 00:20:44,265
you urged Mr. Lewis

501
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:47,401
to bring the Lincoln plant
into compliance to obey the law,

502
00:20:47,435 --> 00:20:49,069
- is that right?
- Yes.

503
00:20:49,104 --> 00:20:51,906
I told him that we were doing
damage to that community,

504
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,441
that state legislators
were sounding alarm bells.

505
00:20:54,476 --> 00:20:57,111
- His response?
- He told me to get out of his office.

506
00:20:57,145 --> 00:20:59,580
He told me I was the alarmist.

507
00:20:59,614 --> 00:21:02,683
- Mr. Cantor, you are divorced, correct?
- I am.

508
00:21:02,717 --> 00:21:03,847
And is it true, Mr. Cantor,

509
00:21:03,882 --> 00:21:05,719
that during your divorce proceedings,

510
00:21:05,754 --> 00:21:07,955
you swore under oath
that you were at all times

511
00:21:07,989 --> 00:21:10,229
faithful to your wife during
the course of your marriage?

512
00:21:11,626 --> 00:21:13,694
- That's correct.
- Isn't it true, Mr. Cantor,

513
00:21:13,728 --> 00:21:15,262
that, while married to Lily Cantor,

514
00:21:15,297 --> 00:21:17,031
you attended sex parties
at a private club

515
00:21:17,065 --> 00:21:18,709
- called "Venom" at least 16 times...
- Objection!

516
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:20,301
To what? The name "Venom"?

517
00:21:20,335 --> 00:21:23,081
Mr. Cantor's sex life is
completely irrelevant.

518
00:21:23,106 --> 00:21:25,249
This isn't about his sex life.
This is about his credibility.

519
00:21:25,273 --> 00:21:26,273
I'll allow it.

520
00:21:27,943 --> 00:21:30,778
Mr. Cantor, you have shown
an alarming ability to lie

521
00:21:30,812 --> 00:21:31,972
in order to protect yourself.

522
00:21:32,005 --> 00:21:33,881
Is there any reason
for this jury to believe

523
00:21:33,915 --> 00:21:36,216
that you are not doing
the exact same thing here?

524
00:21:43,258 --> 00:21:46,093
Crankshaft just needs
a little TLC is all.

525
00:21:46,127 --> 00:21:47,661
I'll fix it up, free of charge.

526
00:21:47,696 --> 00:21:48,988
You don't have to do that.

527
00:21:49,022 --> 00:21:51,165
It's no trouble.
Just happy she's still in use.

528
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:55,736
Everybody's got smartphones
and... and search engines.

529
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:58,405
I get it. I like the Internet, too,

530
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,774
but do you know who made the Internet?

531
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:02,743
That curlyhaired kid from the movie?

532
00:22:02,777 --> 00:22:04,611
I haven't the faintest idea.

533
00:22:04,646 --> 00:22:07,982
What I do know is that
I carved this handle.

534
00:22:08,016 --> 00:22:09,516
I soldered this joint.

535
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:11,151
There's a crack in this corner.

536
00:22:11,186 --> 00:22:12,686
That's you...

537
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:15,389
and all the people who've used her since.

538
00:22:17,525 --> 00:22:19,293
Sorry about the place.

539
00:22:19,327 --> 00:22:22,329
Moved in such a hurry
and haven't had time to...

540
00:22:22,364 --> 00:22:24,164
Started a new job.

541
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:26,033
Here's some milk.

542
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:27,134
Thank you.

543
00:22:27,168 --> 00:22:31,171
So... the doctor said
he couldn't find anything wrong.

544
00:22:31,206 --> 00:22:34,441
No. They never do.

545
00:22:34,476 --> 00:22:37,678
Over the last five years,
I've been called,

546
00:22:37,712 --> 00:22:41,815
"stressed," "depressed,"
"moody," "premenopausal."

547
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,685
I've had blood tests, thyroid tests,

548
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:47,521
Chinese tea, acupuncture.

549
00:22:47,555 --> 00:22:50,724
The only thing that came close
to working was paroxetine,

550
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:53,494
but I didn't feel like myself.

551
00:22:53,528 --> 00:22:55,362
Mitchell... that's my ex...

552
00:22:55,397 --> 00:22:57,831
he wanted me to stay on it.

553
00:22:57,866 --> 00:23:00,446
We fought.

554
00:23:01,503 --> 00:23:03,337
I think it's hard
to live with a crazy person.

555
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:05,506
Can we not say "crazy"?

556
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,374
But I thought that was my defense.

557
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:09,143
It was, Chloe.

558
00:23:09,177 --> 00:23:12,713
But... the psychiatrist
didn't find anything,

559
00:23:12,747 --> 00:23:14,581
and I need to explore with you

560
00:23:14,616 --> 00:23:17,051
if maybe there's something else
going on here.

561
00:23:17,085 --> 00:23:18,886
Something you might not have told me.

562
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,119
Do you not believe me?

563
00:23:20,153 --> 00:23:22,423
It's... not about what I believe, Chloe.

564
00:23:22,457 --> 00:23:25,262
It's about what the jury will believe.

565
00:23:25,794 --> 00:23:28,362
That's okay. I understand.
I'm used to it.

566
00:23:28,396 --> 00:23:31,268
Maybe we can talk more
about the incident.

567
00:23:32,534 --> 00:23:33,960
Did you have any history

568
00:23:33,985 --> 00:23:35,335
- with the mail carrier?
- No.

569
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,381
- Why were you in the building that day?
- I don't know.

570
00:23:37,405 --> 00:23:38,597
I'm your attorney.

571
00:23:38,632 --> 00:23:40,407
Anything you say to me is protected.

572
00:23:40,442 --> 00:23:41,942
My son got frustrated, too.

573
00:23:41,976 --> 00:23:43,444
I'm not frustrated.

574
00:23:43,478 --> 00:23:46,213
He doesn't want much
to do with me these days.

575
00:23:46,247 --> 00:23:47,281
I don't blame him.

576
00:23:47,315 --> 00:23:50,517
He needed his mom to be
the same person day to day.

577
00:23:50,552 --> 00:23:53,053
She's not much of a mom.

578
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,965
Let's talk about why you felt
you were in danger...

579
00:23:54,989 --> 00:23:56,208
I wasn't always like this.

580
00:23:56,242 --> 00:23:57,635
In college, I was on the Dean's list...

581
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:59,193
Have you been attacked before?

582
00:23:59,227 --> 00:24:00,304
Gamma Delta Gamma president.

583
00:24:00,328 --> 00:24:02,629
I was a cheerleader.
I went abroad my junior year...

584
00:24:02,664 --> 00:24:04,798
Maybe there's still
a selfdefense argument.

585
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,433
That's when I met Mitchell...

586
00:24:06,468 --> 00:24:07,679
Wait.

587
00:24:08,603 --> 00:24:09,803
You were a cheerleader?

588
00:24:09,838 --> 00:24:11,438
Since I was 14.

589
00:24:11,473 --> 00:24:13,340
National champions one year.

590
00:24:16,144 --> 00:24:17,444
Why?

591
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,881
Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy,

592
00:24:20,915 --> 00:24:24,051
a degenerative brain disease from
years as a competitive cheerleader.

593
00:24:24,085 --> 00:24:25,322
I thought CTE was caused by

594
00:24:25,357 --> 00:24:26,630
years of getting clobbered
playing football.

595
00:24:26,654 --> 00:24:28,522
It's also caused by this...

596
00:24:31,459 --> 00:24:34,294
Cheerleading causes half
of all catastrophic injuries

597
00:24:34,329 --> 00:24:35,863
in female athletes.

598
00:24:37,499 --> 00:24:38,509
I watch a lot of "SportsCenter."

599
00:24:38,533 --> 00:24:40,501
- I've never heard of this.
- Most people haven't.

600
00:24:40,535 --> 00:24:43,570
But CTE explains
everything about Chloe...

601
00:24:43,605 --> 00:24:45,472
confusion, rage, memory loss...

602
00:24:45,507 --> 00:24:47,251
Why didn't this come up
in the psychiatric evaluation?

603
00:24:47,275 --> 00:24:49,726
Because it doesn't show up
on a psychiatric evaluation.

604
00:24:49,751 --> 00:24:50,964
Well, how do you test for it?

605
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:52,078
There is no test for it.

606
00:24:52,112 --> 00:24:54,815
It's diagnosed at death with an autopsy.

607
00:24:54,849 --> 00:24:56,652
I watch a lot of "SportsCenter," too.

608
00:24:56,686 --> 00:24:58,452
That has been the only way,

609
00:24:58,486 --> 00:25:00,521
but there's a doctor, here in New York,

610
00:25:00,555 --> 00:25:02,122
Alexander Cole, working on a new test.

611
00:25:02,157 --> 00:25:03,345
That won't be admissible.

612
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,927
Then your job is to make it admissible!

613
00:25:06,961 --> 00:25:08,105
So now you have something to do

614
00:25:08,129 --> 00:25:10,164
instead of just standing there.

615
00:25:10,198 --> 00:25:12,633
She has CTE, and we're gonna get
her tested,

616
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:16,103
and then we'll know and she will know.

617
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,762
Again? I don't like it.

618
00:25:31,419 --> 00:25:33,220
I need to talk to someone.

619
00:25:33,254 --> 00:25:34,999
So, talk to whoever it was
you talked to last time.

620
00:25:35,023 --> 00:25:37,001
- That seemed to work.
- That got me into this mess.

621
00:25:37,025 --> 00:25:39,229
God. I have to sit down now, don't I?

622
00:25:43,264 --> 00:25:44,498
My case is falling apart,

623
00:25:44,532 --> 00:25:47,301
I'm getting humiliated by Todd Hardart...

624
00:25:47,335 --> 00:25:48,635
Hardhart?

625
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,070
Sorry, what are you saying?

626
00:25:50,104 --> 00:25:51,138
My old firm.

627
00:25:51,172 --> 00:25:54,007
They've got an army
of associates working 24/7,

628
00:25:54,042 --> 00:25:55,509
digging up anything and everything

629
00:25:55,543 --> 00:25:56,910
to discredit my witnesses.

630
00:25:56,945 --> 00:25:58,512
They're pummeling me.

631
00:25:58,546 --> 00:26:01,915
I'm letting everyone down...
my mom, Jenny, Theo.

632
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,561
This is why Roger didn't want to hire me.

633
00:26:03,585 --> 00:26:04,862
Roger probably didn't want to hire you

634
00:26:04,886 --> 00:26:06,430
because of the way you sound right now,

635
00:26:06,454 --> 00:26:08,008
which is incredibly whiny.

636
00:26:09,591 --> 00:26:10,891
Roger didn't want to hire you?

637
00:26:10,925 --> 00:26:12,051
That's what I was told.

638
00:26:12,085 --> 00:26:13,537
I was told that my feet were too small

639
00:26:13,561 --> 00:26:14,590
to be a competitive swimmer.

640
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:16,291
And then you won
the state championship...

641
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:18,751
No. Usually, I came in last,
but I didn't give up.

642
00:26:18,776 --> 00:26:19,817
I'm not giving up.

643
00:26:19,851 --> 00:26:22,469
- Is he giving up?
- I am not giving up!

644
00:26:26,107 --> 00:26:28,542
- I'm sorry.
- Don't do that. Don't apologize.

645
00:26:28,576 --> 00:26:30,444
Stay there.

646
00:26:30,478 --> 00:26:32,846
Now what do you need to do
to make your case?

647
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:35,382
They destroyed my witnesses,

648
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:36,750
but I have these memos,

649
00:26:36,784 --> 00:26:38,585
which show the company
knew about the leak

650
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,420
and knew how much
it would cost to fix it.

651
00:26:40,455 --> 00:26:43,257
But you need someone to testify
Lewis actually saw them

652
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:44,958
and decided not to do anything?

653
00:26:44,993 --> 00:26:47,861
Yes. But Jack Lewis is a powerful guy.

654
00:26:47,895 --> 00:26:49,096
People are scared of him.

655
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,864
He flung a piece of bacon
at his secretary.

656
00:26:50,898 --> 00:26:53,634
Former secretary. I saw that
in the "Washington Post."

657
00:26:53,668 --> 00:26:56,348
Top 10 worst CEOs in America.

658
00:26:57,138 --> 00:26:58,809
The secretary!

659
00:26:59,807 --> 00:27:02,029
Now let's get to work.

660
00:27:05,726 --> 00:27:08,812
Ms. Davis, you were Jack
Lewis' secretary for nine months?

661
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:12,380
Nine long months. I'm told it was
two weeks short of a record.

662
00:27:12,414 --> 00:27:13,848
That's why you're here today,

663
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,950
to tell us about Mr. Lewis'
management style...

664
00:27:15,984 --> 00:27:16,984
Objection, Your Honor.

665
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:18,953
The witness did clerical work.
Answered phones.

666
00:27:18,987 --> 00:27:19,954
She knows nothing about

667
00:27:19,988 --> 00:27:22,056
the highly specialized issues
in this case.

668
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,558
She saw every piece of paper
that crossed his desk

669
00:27:24,593 --> 00:27:25,693
for nine months.

670
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,429
This trial is about whether
he's personally responsible

671
00:27:28,463 --> 00:27:30,031
for his company spewing toxins.

672
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,532
How is it not relevant?

673
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,151
I'll allow it.

674
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:37,738
Take us back to the morning
of March 20, 2016,

675
00:27:37,773 --> 00:27:39,073
your last day at the company.

676
00:27:39,107 --> 00:27:40,574
How'd that day begin?

677
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:43,411
Mr. Lewis asked me for
a breakfast sandwich...

678
00:27:43,445 --> 00:27:45,046
egg and cheese on a roll.

679
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,749
He specified egg and cheese on a roll...

680
00:27:48,784 --> 00:27:50,451
- Your Honor...
- Get to the point.

681
00:27:50,485 --> 00:27:52,230
You brought him the sandwich.
Then what happened?

682
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,488
He flung a piece of bacon in my face.

683
00:27:54,523 --> 00:27:57,124
Did he say why
he flung bacon in your face?

684
00:27:57,159 --> 00:27:58,659
He didn't ask for bacon.

685
00:27:58,694 --> 00:28:02,797
He said, "Do only what
I tell you. No more. No less."

686
00:28:02,831 --> 00:28:06,133
He said that 50 times a day to everyone.

687
00:28:06,168 --> 00:28:07,468
That was his management style?

688
00:28:07,502 --> 00:28:09,403
Not a lot of style, but yes.

689
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:12,340
He was a micromanager. About everything.

690
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:15,976
I want to direct your attention
to these four memos,

691
00:28:16,011 --> 00:28:17,912
which have been marked as Exhibit J,

692
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,514
written to Mr. Lewis
over a threeyear period.

693
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:23,351
They estimate the cost of
complying with EPA regulations

694
00:28:23,385 --> 00:28:24,985
at KapplerHays' Lincoln plant.

695
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,831
Objection. The witness
doesn't know the first thing

696
00:28:26,855 --> 00:28:28,923
about EPA regulations.

697
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,591
If he can make bacon relevant,

698
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,159
he gets a crack at this, too.

699
00:28:32,194 --> 00:28:33,694
Do you have an opinion, Ms. Davis,

700
00:28:33,729 --> 00:28:36,797
about whether Mr. Lewis
ever saw these memos?

701
00:28:36,832 --> 00:28:38,033
No.

702
00:28:41,536 --> 00:28:44,772
I mean, it's not an opinion.
He definitely saw them.

703
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,841
No piece of paper
passed through the company

704
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:48,876
without him reading and okaying it.

705
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:51,612
And anyway, these memos
are covered with checkmarks

706
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:54,281
in Mr. Lewis' handwriting.

707
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:55,616
That's his writing.

708
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,551
So, if Mr. Lewis contends he never knew

709
00:28:57,586 --> 00:29:01,021
his facilities were breaking
the law, poisoning children,

710
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,890
do you have an opinion about that?

711
00:29:02,924 --> 00:29:04,725
That would be a lie.

712
00:29:15,871 --> 00:29:17,238
What are you seeing?

713
00:29:17,272 --> 00:29:19,707
I'm seeing high levels
of tau accumulation

714
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:22,676
in the amygdala and in all
subcortical regions.

715
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:23,888
That's where the damaged neurons are.

716
00:29:23,912 --> 00:29:25,246
And what does that mean?

717
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,514
It means she has the brain

718
00:29:26,548 --> 00:29:29,083
of a 50yearold defensive lineman.

719
00:29:29,117 --> 00:29:30,885
It means you were right, Ms. Carlan.

720
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:32,707
The pattern in which her brain lit up

721
00:29:32,741 --> 00:29:35,222
indicates an extremely high
likely that Ms. Daniels suffers

722
00:29:35,257 --> 00:29:37,825
from Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy.

723
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:38,659
I'm sorry.

724
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,661
I need you to testify in a hearing

725
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:43,097
so we can use this scan as evidence.

726
00:29:43,131 --> 00:29:44,316
This isn't FDA approved.

727
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:46,100
It hasn't been tested widely enough.

728
00:29:46,134 --> 00:29:47,612
It'll never hold up in a court hearing.

729
00:29:47,636 --> 00:29:49,203
Yes, it will.

730
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:51,539
We'll make sure of it.

731
00:29:56,945 --> 00:29:59,079
If you walk past the back door
of the library

732
00:29:59,114 --> 00:30:02,416
at Carver Elementary School
in Lincoln, Nebraska,

733
00:30:02,451 --> 00:30:04,852
you'll see a line of students.

734
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,121
Almost anytime,
but always in the afternoon

735
00:30:07,155 --> 00:30:09,423
after lunch and recess.

736
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:12,860
If you don't know Carver, it
looks a little odd. This line.

737
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:16,063
Tucked behind a building,
pressed up against a hedge.

738
00:30:16,097 --> 00:30:18,699
But if you peek around the corner,

739
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:19,897
you see it.

740
00:30:19,932 --> 00:30:22,136
You understand.

741
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:23,704
A drinking fountain.

742
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,706
Blue. Three heads.

743
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,409
Always in the shade. Always cold.

744
00:30:29,102 --> 00:30:32,146
Carver opened in 1961,

745
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,948
and nobody remembers why

746
00:30:33,982 --> 00:30:37,485
this drinking fountain
was put back there,

747
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:41,455
but it's been a part
of the school for over 50 years.

748
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:46,560
Future farmers, accountants,
mayor, an astronaut,

749
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:50,264
doctors, a few lawyers.

750
00:30:50,298 --> 00:30:54,002
They all drank the cold water
from the library fountain.

751
00:30:54,836 --> 00:30:57,471
So did Theo Mars...

752
00:30:57,506 --> 00:31:02,076
every day for the last two years.

753
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,677
He's seven now.

754
00:31:03,712 --> 00:31:09,116
Wants to be a scientist
or a racecar driver.

755
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,452
He's still deciding.

756
00:31:11,486 --> 00:31:13,821
Either way, it's going to be a challenge

757
00:31:13,855 --> 00:31:18,192
because Theo has Leukemia.

758
00:31:18,226 --> 00:31:22,630
Because of the library fountain.

759
00:31:22,664 --> 00:31:28,602
Because Jack Lewis built a plant
next to the school

760
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:32,506
and allowed toxins
to seep into the cold water

761
00:31:32,541 --> 00:31:34,308
that Theo and his classmates at Carver

762
00:31:34,342 --> 00:31:36,510
lined up to drink every day.

763
00:31:36,545 --> 00:31:40,014
Jack Lewis knew this water
was contaminated.

764
00:31:40,048 --> 00:31:44,051
He knew this contaminated water
was making kids sick.

765
00:31:44,085 --> 00:31:45,786
And he knew how to stop it.

766
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,656
And Jack Lewis said no.

767
00:31:51,593 --> 00:31:53,661
What will you say now?

768
00:31:53,695 --> 00:31:56,130
Because there are only two sides here...

769
00:31:56,164 --> 00:32:00,134
KapplerHays or Carver Elementary.

770
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:04,338
Jack Lewis or Theo Mars.

771
00:32:04,372 --> 00:32:06,106
The choice is yours.

772
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:14,648
Carver Elementary is...
unremarkable in a lot of ways.

773
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:20,688
But... it has real spirit.

774
00:32:20,722 --> 00:32:24,658
Heart. Character.

775
00:32:30,632 --> 00:32:33,334
There's a saying at the school...

776
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,669
"Never count a Carver kid out."

777
00:32:38,807 --> 00:32:42,843
So... don't.

778
00:32:46,609 --> 00:32:48,698
Your Honor, the government
strongly objects

779
00:32:48,723 --> 00:32:50,721
to the admission
of any experimental tests...

780
00:32:50,756 --> 00:32:53,363
They weren't done by some kid
with a chemistry set.

781
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:56,524
They come from one of the
world's leading CTE researchers.

782
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:58,993
And while we sincerely hope they
yield results in the future,

783
00:32:59,027 --> 00:33:00,094
in the present,

784
00:33:00,129 --> 00:33:03,030
the only reliable diagnosis
of CTE is through autopsy.

785
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:06,300
Well, my client prefers not to
wait for her autopsy results

786
00:33:06,335 --> 00:33:07,401
to mount her defense.

787
00:33:07,436 --> 00:33:09,570
Your Honor, if she had a diagnosis

788
00:33:09,605 --> 00:33:10,571
of Alzheimer's disease,

789
00:33:10,606 --> 00:33:12,974
we wouldn't be begging
for it to be admitted,

790
00:33:13,008 --> 00:33:16,144
unless this was 1983.

791
00:33:16,178 --> 00:33:17,378
If she were a diabetic,

792
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,480
I could argue low insulin as a factor,

793
00:33:19,515 --> 00:33:21,382
but not 20 years ago.

794
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,918
Every new thing we learn
about mental illness,

795
00:33:23,952 --> 00:33:27,088
we learn from a study
that started as experimental.

796
00:33:27,122 --> 00:33:30,391
Chloe Daniels has a disease,
and she shouldn't be punished

797
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,027
for her bad timing in getting it.

798
00:33:33,061 --> 00:33:36,330
Mental illness has always
been problematic for us.

799
00:33:36,365 --> 00:33:39,433
At one point, schizophrenics
were burned as witches.

800
00:33:39,468 --> 00:33:41,836
Depressives were lobotomized.

801
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:44,372
Women with anxiety were sterilized.

802
00:33:44,406 --> 00:33:46,541
It seems like so long ago, right?

803
00:33:46,575 --> 00:33:48,576
But out there, now,

804
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:51,612
lives are being wasted in institutions,

805
00:33:51,647 --> 00:33:53,347
families broken up.

806
00:33:53,382 --> 00:33:57,051
People are living and dying
under overpasses

807
00:33:57,085 --> 00:34:01,422
because they have no idea
that a pill could fix it.

808
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:06,227
Chloe Daniels has lost a marriage, a son,

809
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:09,363
and, soon... her life.

810
00:34:09,398 --> 00:34:11,465
Even if we can show that she has CTE,

811
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,868
a cure is a long way off.

812
00:34:13,902 --> 00:34:15,570
She has a disease,

813
00:34:15,604 --> 00:34:18,206
and letting us mount her best defense,

814
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,809
all we're really deciding
is whether she dies of it

815
00:34:21,843 --> 00:34:25,580
in prison or out.

816
00:34:29,284 --> 00:34:31,485
They offered a deferred
prosecution agreement.

817
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,487
Essentially a term of probation.

818
00:34:33,522 --> 00:34:36,958
She'll be supervised by
pretrial services for two years.

819
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,768
That's good.

820
00:34:39,695 --> 00:34:41,329
You don't look good.

821
00:34:41,363 --> 00:34:43,598
She needs help,

822
00:34:43,632 --> 00:34:46,267
someone to take care of her.

823
00:34:46,301 --> 00:34:48,936
This disease is degenerative.
She's only gonna get worse.

824
00:34:48,971 --> 00:34:50,156
What about her family?

825
00:34:50,191 --> 00:34:52,673
Her son doesn't want anything
to do with her.

826
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:54,942
She's burned every bridge.

827
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,248
My sister was like that.

828
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:03,751
I have a sister.

829
00:35:05,654 --> 00:35:06,787
Where is she?

830
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:11,592
I don't know.

831
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:23,104
Madame foreperson,

832
00:35:23,138 --> 00:35:25,373
how do you find
the defendant, Jack Lewis,

833
00:35:25,407 --> 00:35:26,874
on Count One of the Indictment,

834
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:28,709
violating the Clean Water Act,

835
00:35:28,744 --> 00:35:30,478
guilty or not guilty?

836
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:35,617
Guilty.

837
00:35:45,093 --> 00:35:47,495
Are we going to discover
electricity next?

838
00:35:47,529 --> 00:35:48,729
I know what you think.

839
00:35:48,764 --> 00:35:50,298
Do you? Really?

840
00:35:50,332 --> 00:35:52,166
I know. I'm a dinosaur.
I don't like change.

841
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,411
I'm the mother of the Mother Court.

842
00:35:53,435 --> 00:35:56,971
I'm protecting all these antique
traditions and institutions.

843
00:35:57,005 --> 00:35:58,673
I guess you do know what I think.

844
00:35:58,707 --> 00:36:01,208
It's not that. I mean, that is all true.

845
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:06,380
I used to take the Wheel
home every weekend.

846
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:08,316
You didn't know that, did you?

847
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,551
I'm sure it's a federal crime.

848
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,619
It is.

849
00:36:11,653 --> 00:36:14,689
Larry and I couldn't decide
about a lot of things.

850
00:36:14,723 --> 00:36:16,724
Not big things. Little things.

851
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:19,026
Where to go to dinner.
Where to go on vacation.

852
00:36:19,061 --> 00:36:22,196
So, I started bringing the Wheel home,

853
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:25,333
and we'd write all our options
on little pieces of paper

854
00:36:25,367 --> 00:36:28,402
and put them in the Wheel
and the Wheel would decide.

855
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:30,604
We trusted the Wheel.

856
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:34,709
It got kind of addictive in our home.

857
00:36:34,743 --> 00:36:38,079
When Jason was deciding
where to go to college,

858
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,180
he used the Wheel.

859
00:36:39,214 --> 00:36:40,255
For real!

860
00:36:40,289 --> 00:36:43,718
He went to Wesleyan because of the Wheel.

861
00:36:43,752 --> 00:36:45,753
These are bigger things.

862
00:36:47,609 --> 00:36:52,713
When Larry... got sick...

863
00:36:56,451 --> 00:37:00,587
two days before he died, he
wanted me to read him a story.

864
00:37:00,612 --> 00:37:04,514
He couldn't decide.

865
00:37:04,539 --> 00:37:07,174
So we gave it to the Wheel.

866
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:11,936
And I read him
"Hound of the Baskervilles."

867
00:37:11,961 --> 00:37:13,461
He liked that.

868
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,965
The Wheel was fair.

869
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:23,461
It saw us through a lot of joy
and excruciating sadness.

870
00:37:23,486 --> 00:37:27,429
I could... take it home, Nick...

871
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:31,617
but that's hard now.

872
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:36,050
It belongs here.

873
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,917
Hey.

874
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:51,752
What are you still doing here?

875
00:37:51,787 --> 00:37:53,654
I got a trial in the morning.

876
00:37:55,457 --> 00:37:58,325
I'm gonna grab something to eat.

877
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,460
If you...?

878
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,863
I think I might be out for this one.

879
00:38:02,898 --> 00:38:05,599
I'm gonna finish up here
and then I got a thing later.

880
00:38:05,634 --> 00:38:07,768
A thing? With a girl?

881
00:38:07,803 --> 00:38:08,837
Hopefully.

882
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:11,672
Okay, well, if you change your mind,

883
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:15,876
I'll probably be watching
"Charade" in my pajamas.

884
00:38:15,911 --> 00:38:17,511
I'd expect no less.

885
00:38:18,914 --> 00:38:20,815
Good night, Kate.

886
00:38:20,849 --> 00:38:22,249
Good night.

887
00:38:32,761 --> 00:38:34,795
Jack Lewis is going to jail.

888
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,697
KapplerHays agreed to
triple the health fund

889
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,666
to $150 million.

890
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,867
This is a day.

891
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,135
You should go home. Celebrate.

892
00:38:41,169 --> 00:38:42,369
I'm good.

893
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,974
I didn't think you could pull it off.

894
00:38:47,008 --> 00:38:48,709
I know you didn't.

895
00:38:50,846 --> 00:38:54,815
I never watched "Rocky." Not interested.

896
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:57,685
Because I don't want to
just "go the distance."

897
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:01,222
I like "Rocky IV"

898
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:05,326
because he wins
against a roidedup commie.

899
00:39:10,131 --> 00:39:13,033
Whoever you are,
I prefer you to Seth Oliver.

900
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:25,846
Hey.

901
00:39:25,881 --> 00:39:26,947
Hey.

902
00:39:26,982 --> 00:39:28,883
I won.

903
00:39:28,917 --> 00:39:31,018
What is this?

904
00:39:31,052 --> 00:39:32,353
I wanted to say thank you.

905
00:39:34,089 --> 00:39:35,289
Okay, Seth. Great.

906
00:39:35,323 --> 00:39:38,025
And also apologize.

907
00:39:40,395 --> 00:39:42,062
I left.

908
00:39:42,097 --> 00:39:44,698
It was hard, but it was
the right thing to do.

909
00:39:47,768 --> 00:39:48,836
I can't have it both ways.

910
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:51,205
I can't leave you and then lean on you.

911
00:39:52,073 --> 00:39:55,075
It's not fair. It's wrong.

912
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,381
It's not good for either of us.

913
00:40:00,415 --> 00:40:04,618
No matter how...
right it feels in the moment.

914
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,802
Again... I underestimated you.

915
00:40:32,981 --> 00:40:36,283
And you promise you'll call me
if you need anything?

916
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:38,452
Yes. Thank you.

917
00:40:40,722 --> 00:40:42,523
Jill?

918
00:40:42,557 --> 00:40:45,659
Um... you said you'd call my son?

919
00:40:47,495 --> 00:40:50,222
I wasn't able to reach him.

920
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,102
But I'll keep trying. I promise.

921
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:09,453

1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,931
<i>Previously on "For the People"...</i>

2
00:00:01,966 --> 00:00:04,188
Your client tried to blow up the
Statue of Liberty, Sandra Bell.

3
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:07,852
We the jury find the
defendant, Mohammed Fayed, guilty.

4
00:00:07,886 --> 00:00:09,086
You could be a good lawyer.

5
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:11,088
If you tried. You're just not trying.

6
00:00:11,123 --> 00:00:13,257
My tradition is now to eat with you

7
00:00:13,292 --> 00:00:15,426
every night before
the first day of trial.

8
00:00:15,461 --> 00:00:17,228
Can I get your number?

9
00:00:17,263 --> 00:00:19,096
I like you.

10
00:00:19,131 --> 00:00:20,560
This could never work.

11
00:00:20,595 --> 00:00:23,166
We'd be lying in bed,
and I'd be infuriated.

12
00:00:23,202 --> 00:00:24,400
My takeaway from that is that

13
00:00:24,436 --> 00:00:26,168
you've thought about us lying in bed.

14
00:00:26,204 --> 00:00:28,170
How is it that your first time on duty,

15
00:00:28,206 --> 00:00:29,239
you get him?

16
00:00:29,274 --> 00:00:31,374
I'd like for you to come by
my office this afternoon

17
00:00:31,409 --> 00:00:32,442
so we can discuss some things.

18
00:00:32,477 --> 00:00:34,277
- It's a date.
- It's not a date.

19
00:00:34,312 --> 00:00:36,246
- Do you miss him?
- Sometimes.

20
00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:38,348
This is the United States District Court

21
00:00:38,383 --> 00:00:40,250
for the Southern District of New York.

22
00:00:40,285 --> 00:00:41,608
Are you worthy?

23
00:00:44,655 --> 00:00:46,221
Do you hate me?

24
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,089
Why would I hate you?

25
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,864
It wasn't that bad. I mean, it wasn't...

26
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:51,126
No, not that.

27
00:00:51,161 --> 00:00:53,629
I mean, you said we'd end up
in bed next to each other

28
00:00:53,664 --> 00:00:54,630
with you hating me.

29
00:00:54,665 --> 00:00:56,197
Oh, yeah, right.

30
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:58,332
Well, yes. Give it time.

31
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,801
But for right now...

32
00:01:00,836 --> 00:01:01,769
it's fun.

33
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:40,172
Have you been working here all night?

34
00:01:40,207 --> 00:01:42,974
I was in the kitchen from 2:15 to 3:00.

35
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,010
I think I broke the toaster.

36
00:01:45,045 --> 00:01:47,212
Did you finish?

37
00:01:47,247 --> 00:01:48,347
Yes.

38
00:01:48,382 --> 00:01:49,429
How do you feel?

39
00:01:49,464 --> 00:01:51,349
I feel like I shouldn't have
lost the trial

40
00:01:51,384 --> 00:01:52,650
in the first place.

41
00:02:14,606 --> 00:02:16,072
I'm thinking about getting a unicycle.

42
00:02:16,107 --> 00:02:17,228
- No.
- I am.

43
00:02:17,264 --> 00:02:19,075
But this was going so well, you and me.

44
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,276
I think it'd be cool.

45
00:02:20,312 --> 00:02:22,379
You are mistaken.

46
00:02:22,414 --> 00:02:23,612
You really do that every morning?

47
00:02:23,648 --> 00:02:24,680
Every morning.

48
00:02:24,716 --> 00:02:27,416
She walks across the
Brooklyn Bridge every morning.

49
00:02:27,452 --> 00:02:29,981
- And back. What are you doing here?
- Me?

50
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,287
You're not just loitering around
the clerk's desk, are you?

51
00:02:32,323 --> 00:02:33,328
No.

52
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,541
Because you know I wouldn't like that.

53
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:36,425
'Course I know that.
What's to like about that?

54
00:02:36,461 --> 00:02:37,593
What are you doing here?

55
00:02:37,628 --> 00:02:41,596
I am here because I am on duty.

56
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:42,630
Really?

57
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:43,608
Uh-huh.

58
00:02:43,644 --> 00:02:44,466
Duty?

59
00:02:44,501 --> 00:02:45,565
Yep.

60
00:02:46,436 --> 00:02:47,435
Okay.

61
00:02:49,406 --> 00:02:50,438
Here's your case.

62
00:02:50,474 --> 00:02:51,939
Cool. No problem.

63
00:02:51,975 --> 00:02:52,999
Shouldn't be if you're on duty.

64
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:56,444
And it isn't. Because I<i> am</i> on duty.

65
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,245
No problem.

66
00:03:01,484 --> 00:03:03,283
Huge problem! I can't do this.

67
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:04,284
Where did you get this?

68
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,319
- I picked it up on duty.
- You're not on duty.

69
00:03:06,355 --> 00:03:08,288
You know, this is a great point.
I like this point.

70
00:03:08,323 --> 00:03:09,857
Oh, so smart, Sandra.

71
00:03:11,627 --> 00:03:13,093
Eh, see, I like that less.

72
00:03:13,128 --> 00:03:15,127
What is the problem?

73
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:16,171
Ohhh.

74
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,797
- Ohh.
- Oh.

75
00:03:17,832 --> 00:03:18,964
Kate Littlejohn.

76
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,065
You'll be fine.

77
00:03:20,101 --> 00:03:21,601
No. I will not be fine.

78
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:25,337
Do you realize I have an actual fear
of fluorescent colors because of her?

79
00:03:25,373 --> 00:03:26,572
Because of the tabs!

80
00:03:26,608 --> 00:03:28,307
A clinically verifiable phobia.

81
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:31,277
I have been treated
for this... unsuccessfully!

82
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:32,677
- Brainbridge.
- What?

83
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,178
Oh, sorry... Bainbridge.

84
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,732
I keep mixing that up.

85
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:38,316
Bank robbery. Government's gonna
offer a favorable deal.

86
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:42,320
Alice Huang. Staff hydrologist
with the U.S. Geological Survey.

87
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,186
She's being charged with downloading

88
00:03:44,211 --> 00:03:46,425
and transmitting sensitive
scientific data

89
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,126
about water distribution systems
to the Chinese.

90
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:50,213
You okay?

91
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,430
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

92
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,197
She was up all night on the Fayed appeal.

93
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,533
I slept, like, 11 hours last night.

94
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,703
I can totally switch.

95
00:03:56,738 --> 00:03:58,702
It's okay. I'm okay. I got it.

96
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:02,272
Okay, well, good morning, everyone!

97
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,508
Let's make this a great day.

98
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:09,145
This is one of those mornings
where I wonder

99
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,680
what it's like across the street.

100
00:04:10,715 --> 00:04:12,114
Grim and quiet,

101
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,183
plotting death and destruction all day.

102
00:04:14,218 --> 00:04:15,284
Good morning, everyone!

103
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,519
How was everyone's morning?

104
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:17,478
Littlejohn?

105
00:04:17,514 --> 00:04:18,855
My morning was great, sir.

106
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:19,989
I am glad to hear it.

107
00:04:20,024 --> 00:04:21,023
Mine too.

108
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:22,028
Excellent.

109
00:04:22,063 --> 00:04:23,549
I would say excellent, as well.

110
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:25,794
- And I would say, for me...
- Okay. Let's get started.

111
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,564
Mr. Oliver, this is a case
I was gonna give to Mr. Knox,

112
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:29,898
but I knew he would complain about it,

113
00:04:29,934 --> 00:04:32,734
and I knew you'd smile and say,
"I appreciate the opportunity,"

114
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,402
and then mumble something
under your breath about me.

115
00:04:34,438 --> 00:04:36,538
No, sir. I do appreciate the opportunity.

116
00:04:36,574 --> 00:04:37,637
Always giving me the worst...

117
00:04:37,673 --> 00:04:39,740
Broti. Your wine informant has gone AWOL.

118
00:04:39,776 --> 00:04:40,775
This is a problem.

119
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,878
Ms. Littlejohn,
a parent at The Whitley School

120
00:04:43,913 --> 00:04:46,046
has apparently been found
with MDMA in her car.

121
00:04:46,082 --> 00:04:47,117
This is now your problem.

122
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:49,049
Since when is this a federal prosecution?

123
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:51,385
Since two other parents at the
school called their good friend

124
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,408
the United States Attorney

125
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:54,421
for the Southern District
of New York Douglas Delap

126
00:04:54,457 --> 00:04:56,090
and asked his office to handle it.

127
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,390
And I want you to keep those parents

128
00:04:57,425 --> 00:04:58,492
up to speed on this case.

129
00:04:58,527 --> 00:05:02,829
Speaking of parents,
Mr. Knox, your mom is in town.

130
00:05:02,865 --> 00:05:04,879
I know this because you
tried to put lunch

131
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,566
for the three of us on my calendar,

132
00:05:06,602 --> 00:05:08,067
and I took this off my calendar.

133
00:05:08,103 --> 00:05:10,770
And in case anybody is not yet aware,

134
00:05:10,806 --> 00:05:11,934
Leonard Knox's mom

135
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,572
is a United States Senator!

136
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:18,410
And, finally, Ms. Chavez,
you are up against Sandra Bell.

137
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:19,748
Some of the other attorneys here

138
00:05:19,783 --> 00:05:21,881
will have negative things
to say about that,

139
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,517
but I am not a negative person,
and I encourage everybody else

140
00:05:24,552 --> 00:05:27,419
to be kind and respectful
to our adversaries.

141
00:05:27,454 --> 00:05:30,989
Thank you all. It's been a great pleasure
spending time with you this morning.

142
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:35,126
Sandra Bell is a total pain in the ass.

143
00:05:35,161 --> 00:05:37,562
- Sandra Bell is sanctimonious...
- Crush Sandra Bell.

144
00:05:37,597 --> 00:05:39,531
I'm not a spy, Ms. Bell.

145
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:42,534
Why don't you tell me
about Mr. Hua Lin...

146
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:43,768
how you were first introduced?

147
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:46,704
In the summer of 2015,

148
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,139
I was visiting my parents in Beijing.

149
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:52,543
My former professor introduced
me to Hua Lin at a party.

150
00:05:52,578 --> 00:05:55,445
We talked about fluid mechanics,

151
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,583
streamflow response...
things we both care about...

152
00:05:59,618 --> 00:06:01,618
and from there, it grew.

153
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:02,762
Personal.

154
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,289
I visited him three times in Beijing

155
00:06:07,324 --> 00:06:09,091
over a two-year period.

156
00:06:09,126 --> 00:06:12,828
I visited his office at
the Ministry of Water Resources.

157
00:06:12,864 --> 00:06:15,798
We stayed together in a hotel.

158
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,268
That's where I gave him
two flash drives full of data.

159
00:06:19,303 --> 00:06:21,736
Which I did not have access to.

160
00:06:21,772 --> 00:06:23,939
Lin didn't ask me for any of this.

161
00:06:23,974 --> 00:06:25,607
I offered it.

162
00:06:25,642 --> 00:06:29,343
Because we were scientists
trying to solve a problem.

163
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:31,082
That was the real reason.

164
00:06:31,615 --> 00:06:37,018
But the personal side,
it just complicated everything.

165
00:06:37,054 --> 00:06:39,587
And by the time the FBI
showed up at my desk,

166
00:06:39,622 --> 00:06:43,624
I had deleted so many e-mails,
lied about so many things...

167
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:45,764
I-I couldn't tell the truth.

168
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:48,600
We are both married.

169
00:06:49,498 --> 00:06:51,065
And we both have children.

170
00:06:54,036 --> 00:06:56,502
I know how it looks.

171
00:06:56,537 --> 00:06:58,568
How it always looks.

172
00:06:59,407 --> 00:07:01,808
Whenever I spoke Chinese
on the phone at work,

173
00:07:01,843 --> 00:07:03,810
with a family member,

174
00:07:03,845 --> 00:07:06,117
people would make these comments.

175
00:07:06,815 --> 00:07:08,180
What about?

176
00:07:08,216 --> 00:07:10,549
Wen Ho Lee. Chi Mak. Greg Chung.

177
00:07:10,585 --> 00:07:12,718
People made jokes about
Chinese-American scientists

178
00:07:12,753 --> 00:07:14,352
who had been accused of espionage?

179
00:07:14,387 --> 00:07:15,721
I just let it pass.

180
00:07:15,756 --> 00:07:17,379
We do that.

181
00:07:18,358 --> 00:07:20,826
But... now I'm here.

182
00:07:23,363 --> 00:07:25,530
The courthouse where I was arraigned...

183
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:28,139
that's where I became a citizen.

184
00:07:29,202 --> 00:07:31,335
I love my new country, Ms. Bell.

185
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,738
My children are Americans.

186
00:07:33,773 --> 00:07:35,272
I've built my life here.

187
00:07:37,276 --> 00:07:39,010
Can you help me?

188
00:07:43,282 --> 00:07:50,316

189
00:07:57,485 --> 00:07:59,788
Good to hear from you. How's it going?

190
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,211
You know, working a lot.

191
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,380
Tried oysters for the first time.

192
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,115
Don't totally understand what I'm eating.

193
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,217
Is that the body?

194
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,218
The head?

195
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:11,121
W-What is this little lump exactly?

196
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,290
I just... don't think about it.

197
00:08:13,325 --> 00:08:14,625
I had this friend in high school,

198
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,060
he wouldn't eat anything with eyes.

199
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:19,517
So, a lot of scallops, clams, oysters.

200
00:08:19,552 --> 00:08:20,564
Potatoes?

201
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:21,598
Yes.

202
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:23,033
That's a good point.

203
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,103
You wanted to...

204
00:08:27,138 --> 00:08:28,616
tell me something?

205
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,807
Really, I wanted to have coffee with you.

206
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:31,867
But yes.

207
00:08:31,903 --> 00:08:35,077
Your wine forger client? Toby Mahler?

208
00:08:35,112 --> 00:08:36,330
He missed a tasting with the FBI.

209
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:38,180
They're getting a warrant.
You didn't hear it from me.

210
00:08:38,215 --> 00:08:39,214
Thank you.

211
00:08:39,249 --> 00:08:41,416
For real, though, please
don't use this against me.

212
00:08:41,452 --> 00:08:42,685
I would never.

213
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,919
Again.

214
00:08:46,156 --> 00:08:49,124
All right. I got to go deal with Toby.

215
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,430
Thank you.

216
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:52,259
For all of this.

217
00:08:56,733 --> 00:08:58,332
Oysters are amazing.

218
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,301
You clearly had the wrong ones.

219
00:09:00,336 --> 00:09:02,025
I'll take you somewhere good.

220
00:09:02,973 --> 00:09:04,194
You'll see.

221
00:09:08,744 --> 00:09:10,844
I know all your clients
probably say this,

222
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:13,847
but I have no idea how those
things ended up inside my car.

223
00:09:13,882 --> 00:09:16,116
You'd actually be surprised
how many<i> don't</i> say that.

224
00:09:16,151 --> 00:09:17,350
I've never even <i>tried</i> drugs.

225
00:09:17,385 --> 00:09:19,452
I feel like I'm living in some sort of

226
00:09:19,488 --> 00:09:21,822
horrible alternative universe.

227
00:09:21,857 --> 00:09:22,889
I can't sleep.

228
00:09:22,925 --> 00:09:25,225
I'm trying not to let my son
see how terrified I am,

229
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,726
because if something happened to me...

230
00:09:26,761 --> 00:09:28,060
If you plead guilty,

231
00:09:28,096 --> 00:09:29,361
I can probably get you probation.

232
00:09:29,396 --> 00:09:30,796
No jail time.

233
00:09:30,832 --> 00:09:32,064
But that would mean pleading guilty,

234
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,298
and if you insist that you're not...

235
00:09:33,334 --> 00:09:35,067
What about William?

236
00:09:35,103 --> 00:09:36,168
His scholarship?

237
00:09:37,371 --> 00:09:39,672
It's hard for me to imagine
that he'd stay at the school.

238
00:09:42,043 --> 00:09:44,809
Do you know who called the police?

239
00:09:44,845 --> 00:09:46,344
Told them to search my car?

240
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:47,979
It was an anonymous tip.

241
00:09:48,015 --> 00:09:50,581
This sounds crazy, but...

242
00:09:50,617 --> 00:09:53,351
there's a mother at the school...

243
00:09:53,386 --> 00:09:55,086
a lawyer.

244
00:09:55,122 --> 00:09:56,387
Dana Gallagher.

245
00:09:56,422 --> 00:09:57,989
And I ran against her this year

246
00:09:58,025 --> 00:09:59,723
to be head of the Parents' Association.

247
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:00,829
I won.

248
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:02,726
She and her husband have three kids

249
00:10:02,762 --> 00:10:04,828
that go to The Whitley School.

250
00:10:04,864 --> 00:10:08,231
And they never liked me.
I don't know why.

251
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:10,333
Maybe if you're paying tuition
for three kids,

252
00:10:10,369 --> 00:10:13,270
you're bound to hate the person
whose kid goes for free.

253
00:10:13,305 --> 00:10:16,706
William worked so hard
for that scholarship.

254
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:20,309
At his old school,
there were these kids that...

255
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,816
He had a rough time.

256
00:10:25,216 --> 00:10:27,449
How do I tell him
he has to go back there?

257
00:10:27,485 --> 00:10:29,952
Let's take it one step at a time, okay?

258
00:10:29,988 --> 00:10:31,754
Maybe you won't have to.

259
00:10:32,407 --> 00:10:34,956
Webb Flynt is stepping down
as Solicitor General?

260
00:10:34,992 --> 00:10:36,224
I thought he'd die in that chair,

261
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:39,695
but apparently he wants to fish
and play with his grandchildren.

262
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,763
- Whatever.
- So, what's the word?

263
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,799
Who's the AG looking at as a replacement?

264
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:45,233
Me.

265
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:46,467
You're not leaving the Senate.

266
00:10:46,503 --> 00:10:47,936
He's looking at me for names.

267
00:10:47,971 --> 00:10:49,971
And I only gave him one...

268
00:10:50,007 --> 00:10:51,105
you.

269
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,472
Me?

270
00:10:52,508 --> 00:10:53,908
Yes.

271
00:10:53,943 --> 00:10:55,409
Solicitor General of Texas?

272
00:10:55,444 --> 00:10:57,311
- Yes.
- That's in Texas.

273
00:10:57,346 --> 00:11:00,480
Well, at least we know you'll
be able to find your office.

274
00:11:00,516 --> 00:11:02,817
Is it too soon? I just
got to the Southern District.

275
00:11:02,852 --> 00:11:04,919
Barack Obama had just
gotten into the U.S. Senate

276
00:11:04,954 --> 00:11:06,420
when he ran for President.

277
00:11:06,455 --> 00:11:07,821
Opportunity is opportunity.

278
00:11:07,856 --> 00:11:10,256
- This...
- Is an opportunity.

279
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,259
You did your time in New York.
You come home to Texas.

280
00:11:13,294 --> 00:11:15,829
Accept the Attorney General's
appointment as Solicitor.

281
00:11:15,864 --> 00:11:17,731
You do the job we both know you can do.

282
00:11:17,766 --> 00:11:19,432
Then you use it to launch yourself

283
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:21,400
into the United States Senate.

284
00:11:21,436 --> 00:11:24,104
I'm really settling in at this office.

285
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:26,939
Some of the people I work with,
we're starting to click.

286
00:11:26,974 --> 00:11:28,182
I'm sure they'll forgive you

287
00:11:28,218 --> 00:11:29,975
when you invite them to the White House.

288
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,476
Because that's where you're headed.

289
00:11:32,646 --> 00:11:34,346
This job is mine if I want it?

290
00:11:35,883 --> 00:11:37,555
That's the question...

291
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:39,618
do you want it?

292
00:11:42,055 --> 00:11:43,454
Do you want it?

293
00:11:47,827 --> 00:11:49,359
You look kind of...

294
00:11:50,163 --> 00:11:51,996
- I'm fine.
- Oh?

295
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:56,167
Well, obviously,
selling drugs to children

296
00:11:56,202 --> 00:11:57,635
is an abhorrent offense,

297
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,036
but the good news is,
we're willing to negotiate.

298
00:12:00,072 --> 00:12:03,306
Now, given the amount of MDMA that
was found in the defendant's car

299
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:05,142
and factoring in
her intent to distribute...

300
00:12:05,177 --> 00:12:07,377
Nancy Martin's not a drug dealer.

301
00:12:07,412 --> 00:12:10,013
Really? Just like
Adam Dyle wasn't a scam artist?

302
00:12:10,048 --> 00:12:11,714
- It's not the same.
- Well,<i> you're</i> the same.

303
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,251
Still willing to believe
whatever your client says...

304
00:12:14,286 --> 00:12:16,018
willfully ignoring the evidence.

305
00:12:16,053 --> 00:12:18,320
Look, that evidence
could have been planted.

306
00:12:18,355 --> 00:12:19,655
Nancy's fingerprints weren't on it,

307
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:20,890
she left her car unlocked...

308
00:12:20,925 --> 00:12:22,424
The principal of The Whitley School

309
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:24,693
confirmed there were already
numerous rumors going around

310
00:12:24,728 --> 00:12:25,928
that Nancy sold drugs.

311
00:12:25,963 --> 00:12:27,004
Rumors? Mm.

312
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,564
An anonymous phone call...

313
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,732
Is that a Lego brick?

314
00:12:33,636 --> 00:12:35,837
I have a statement here
from two parents at the school,

315
00:12:35,872 --> 00:12:37,371
Michael and Dana Gallagher.

316
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:39,373
They're both attorneys,
and they will testify

317
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:41,509
- that Ms. Martin has had a...
- Wait. Stop.

318
00:12:41,544 --> 00:12:44,445
The Gallaghers are driving this?

319
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,214
Nobody drives our prosecutions.

320
00:12:46,249 --> 00:12:47,548
Oh, yeah. Right.

321
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,250
The Gallaghers hate Nancy Martin.

322
00:12:49,286 --> 00:12:51,518
She beat out Dana for the head
of the Parents' Association,

323
00:12:51,553 --> 00:12:53,954
and what's worse, she's poor.

324
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:55,740
I think they're playing<i> you.</i>

325
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,425
I think you're the one
who's being Adam Dyled here,

326
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,527
Kate Littlejohn.

327
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:02,595
I think that's it for today, Mr. Simmons.

328
00:13:02,631 --> 00:13:05,132
Why don't you call me when
you're ready to be reasonable.

329
00:13:19,778 --> 00:13:21,239
Thank you for having us in.

330
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,572
Roger says you're one of the good ones.

331
00:13:22,608 --> 00:13:23,802
We are so relieved to hear

332
00:13:23,838 --> 00:13:25,709
the government's
taking this case seriously.

333
00:13:25,744 --> 00:13:28,177
Oh, we take every case
seriously, Ms. Gallagher.

334
00:13:28,213 --> 00:13:30,680
Now, I am sorry that I don't
have more to report right now,

335
00:13:30,716 --> 00:13:33,116
but my hope is we can
have a deal in place by...

336
00:13:33,151 --> 00:13:34,784
I'm sorry, a deal?

337
00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:37,185
A deal with jail time.

338
00:13:37,221 --> 00:13:38,954
This is Ms. Martin's first offense.

339
00:13:38,989 --> 00:13:40,422
You know I'm a litigator, right?

340
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,524
So was Dana before the kids.

341
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,192
We know what an excuse sounds like.

342
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:45,894
It's not an excuse. It's a simple...

343
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:47,195
Maybe we should call Doug.

344
00:13:47,231 --> 00:13:48,364
You don't need to call Mr. Delap.

345
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,566
This woman is ruining our school.

346
00:13:50,601 --> 00:13:52,200
Okay? Do you understand?

347
00:13:52,236 --> 00:13:54,435
So you can sit there
and defend her or you...

348
00:13:54,471 --> 00:13:55,490
I'm not defending her. In fact, I'm...

349
00:13:55,525 --> 00:13:58,773
Listen to me,
you twenty-something-haircut.

350
00:13:58,808 --> 00:14:01,041
Nancy Martin needs to go to jail.

351
00:14:01,077 --> 00:14:02,644
Okay? She's been fooling everyone

352
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,445
with her "I'm such a good person" act

353
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:06,614
and trying to shame
the rest of us into giving up

354
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,750
the Foundations of
Western Civilization curriculum

355
00:14:09,785 --> 00:14:11,137
or trying to set a limit on how much

356
00:14:11,162 --> 00:14:12,753
the kids can spend on their prom night...

357
00:14:12,788 --> 00:14:14,821
it's prom, for God's sake...

358
00:14:14,856 --> 00:14:16,556
when she should just shut up
and be grateful

359
00:14:16,592 --> 00:14:18,659
her kid's even at the school
in the first place.

360
00:14:18,694 --> 00:14:20,226
And now this?

361
00:14:20,262 --> 00:14:22,429
Selling drugs?

362
00:14:22,464 --> 00:14:24,598
I want that woman locked up.

363
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,303
I really don't like those people.

364
00:14:30,338 --> 00:14:31,937
Lucas and Amy?

365
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:34,573
- He does do that thing with his nose...
- The parents who brought this case in.

366
00:14:34,609 --> 00:14:36,409
- She called me a "haircut."
- I don't know what that means.

367
00:14:36,444 --> 00:14:38,577
- Should I talk to Roger?
- I doubt he knows. He's such a...

368
00:14:38,613 --> 00:14:40,746
Should I talk to Roger
about how awful they are?

369
00:14:40,782 --> 00:14:41,913
Dana Gallagher used to work here.

370
00:14:41,938 --> 00:14:42,996
I wouldn't.

371
00:14:43,031 --> 00:14:44,683
I need some help.

372
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,618
Remember that first day here,
when I told you

373
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:47,786
I didn't want to be the help desk

374
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:49,521
for every man in this office?

375
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,456
That was so long ago!

376
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:52,691
Okay, so, here's the thing.

377
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,125
I think I have feelings for this girl...

378
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,193
- Allison.
- Doesn't matter.

379
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,294
And I want to tell this girl...

380
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,696
- Allison.
- How I feel.

381
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,096
How do you feel about Allison?

382
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,298
Not sure.

383
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,667
I mean, I loved her. Then I didn't.

384
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:07,504
But now, seeing her,
it's different, and I just...

385
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,639
I don't know.

386
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,207
Seems like a sweet thing to say.

387
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,642
- Well, I mean, I'm confused...
- Yes. Look.

388
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,444
If you have feelings,
I think you should tell her.

389
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,446
I'm a big believer in being honest.

390
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:16,732
For example...

391
00:15:17,515 --> 00:15:18,981
I would like you to leave now.

392
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:22,414
Well, this was great.

393
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,653
Thank you.

394
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,128
Hey.

395
00:15:33,164 --> 00:15:34,096
Hey?

396
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:39,334
Where have you been?

397
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,370
Flavigny-sur-Ozerain.

398
00:15:41,405 --> 00:15:42,971
What?

399
00:15:43,006 --> 00:15:44,506
It's in France.

400
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,574
Please tell me you're joking.

401
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:48,139
For real. It's a village
in Burgundy. Check the map.

402
00:15:48,846 --> 00:15:50,879
Toby, you can't leave the country!

403
00:15:50,914 --> 00:15:52,205
That's part of the deal.

404
00:15:52,241 --> 00:15:55,649
I was meeting with producers,
tasting new vintages.

405
00:15:55,685 --> 00:15:57,585
I can't help the FBI track down forgers

406
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,420
if I'm not experiencing the latest wines.

407
00:15:59,455 --> 00:16:00,645
Is this about the meeting
I missed on Monday?

408
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,656
Yes. And I will prepare
a statement, but...

409
00:16:02,692 --> 00:16:04,568
No, I think Gerald already
called over to that Broti

410
00:16:04,604 --> 00:16:05,576
or whatever her name is.

411
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:07,828
- Who is Gerald?
- He's my lawyer.

412
00:16:07,864 --> 00:16:08,862
<i>I'm</i> your lawyer.

413
00:16:08,897 --> 00:16:10,497
You<i> were</i> my lawyer.

414
00:16:10,532 --> 00:16:13,500
But now that I can afford
a lawyer, I<i> have</i> a lawyer.

415
00:16:13,535 --> 00:16:14,667
- Wine?
- What?

416
00:16:14,703 --> 00:16:16,235
To celebrate.

417
00:16:16,271 --> 00:16:17,604
No. No wine.

418
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,038
- It's not fake.
- That's not the point.

419
00:16:19,073 --> 00:16:20,130
You said you couldn't go out

420
00:16:20,155 --> 00:16:21,923
on a date with me because
I was your client.

421
00:16:22,644 --> 00:16:24,411
Now I'm not your client.

422
00:16:24,446 --> 00:16:25,778
So there's no reason
we can't see each other.

423
00:16:25,813 --> 00:16:27,446
There are other reasons.

424
00:16:27,481 --> 00:16:28,554
Such as?

425
00:16:31,485 --> 00:16:33,552
Look, if the answer's no,
I'll respect that,

426
00:16:33,587 --> 00:16:35,645
and you'll never hear from me ever again.

427
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:38,397
But before you make up
your mind, just know...

428
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:40,441
I like you.

429
00:16:41,228 --> 00:16:42,593
A lot.

430
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:46,697
You're smart and charming,
interesting, beautiful.

431
00:16:46,733 --> 00:16:48,566
I like being around you.

432
00:16:48,601 --> 00:16:51,202
So, now that you're not my lawyer...

433
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,622
will you at least consider it?

434
00:16:58,478 --> 00:16:59,743
And you said?

435
00:16:59,778 --> 00:17:01,210
I don't know. Something ridiculous.

436
00:17:01,246 --> 00:17:02,278
Because he's ridiculous.

437
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:03,279
Ly hot.

438
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:05,174
But I am enjoying Seth.

439
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:06,847
What is happening here?

440
00:17:06,883 --> 00:17:09,419
- Oh, a cone of depression.
- What's that?

441
00:17:09,455 --> 00:17:11,220
It's a conical shape produced
in a piezometric surface

442
00:17:11,256 --> 00:17:13,222
by the extraction of water
from a well at a given rate.

443
00:17:13,258 --> 00:17:15,792
It's also the place defense lawyers go

444
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:17,292
when they're about to lose a case.

445
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:18,794
Don't say that.

446
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,830
I don't think Alice Huang is a spy.

447
00:17:20,865 --> 00:17:21,831
I truly don't.

448
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:24,667
But this stuff she downloaded
sounds alarming.

449
00:17:24,702 --> 00:17:26,802
"Quantitative Precipitation Forecast."

450
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:29,104
"Site Specific Hydrologic
Prediction System."

451
00:17:29,139 --> 00:17:30,353
A jury is gonna hear this

452
00:17:30,378 --> 00:17:31,841
and they're not gonna have
a clue what it means.

453
00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:32,942
They're just gonna think it sounds bad

454
00:17:32,977 --> 00:17:35,309
and she shouldn't have been
giving it to the Chinese.

455
00:17:37,046 --> 00:17:38,813
Unless...

456
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,582
Unless what?

457
00:17:40,617 --> 00:17:43,017
Unless a jury doesn't hear this.

458
00:17:43,052 --> 00:17:44,373
- A bench trial?
- Yes.

459
00:17:44,408 --> 00:17:46,855
You want to try this in front
of a judge and not a jury?

460
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,289
- Yes.
- Why?

461
00:17:48,324 --> 00:17:50,091
Because the jury's gonna get lost

462
00:17:50,126 --> 00:17:51,758
in the technical jargon of this case.

463
00:17:51,794 --> 00:17:53,760
This is about hydrological engineering

464
00:17:53,796 --> 00:17:56,429
and flow capacities
and moisture state variables.

465
00:17:56,465 --> 00:17:59,386
Is that what this is about?
Or is this about Mohammed Fayed?

466
00:17:59,421 --> 00:18:00,433
No.

467
00:18:00,469 --> 00:18:02,302
About a jury looking at your client

468
00:18:02,337 --> 00:18:03,804
and not at the evidence.

469
00:18:04,974 --> 00:18:06,139
I understand why you're nervous

470
00:18:06,174 --> 00:18:07,474
about taking this to a jury, Sandra.

471
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:08,708
I do. Juries are scary.

472
00:18:08,743 --> 00:18:09,842
Because they're made up of people.

473
00:18:09,878 --> 00:18:14,013
With blinders and biases
and real human limitations.

474
00:18:14,048 --> 00:18:16,115
But a jury is the best chance you have.

475
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:19,184
Because you have 12 chances with a jury

476
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,521
and only one with a judge.

477
00:18:21,556 --> 00:18:23,254
If you think they need to understand

478
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:25,189
this evidence in order to acquit Alice,

479
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:27,191
then help them understand the evidence.

480
00:18:27,227 --> 00:18:29,528
That is your job,
and you are good at your job.

481
00:18:29,563 --> 00:18:31,029
Don't run from it.

482
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,233
I think we should talk.

483
00:18:46,748 --> 00:18:49,815
The voice. Everything.
It all seems so real.

484
00:18:49,851 --> 00:18:50,946
May I come in?

485
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:55,988
I think there's something odd
about this case.

486
00:18:56,023 --> 00:18:57,089
Yeah, me too.

487
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,268
Like, I guess for me, it seems
a little odd that...

488
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,227
- Nancy Martin was framed!
- Yes.

489
00:19:01,263 --> 00:19:03,229
And that the Southern
District of New Y...

490
00:19:03,264 --> 00:19:04,563
Wait, did you just say yes?

491
00:19:04,598 --> 00:19:05,949
- Yes.
- Yes, you said yes?

492
00:19:05,984 --> 00:19:07,766
- Yes.
- Okay.

493
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:08,833
Can you just nod?

494
00:19:08,869 --> 00:19:09,768
Yes.

495
00:19:09,803 --> 00:19:10,835
- Nngh!
- Okay, look.

496
00:19:10,871 --> 00:19:13,004
I think the Gallaghers might
have had something to do

497
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,939
with the situation Nancy is in right now.

498
00:19:14,975 --> 00:19:17,276
Then arrest them and drop
the charges against Nancy.

499
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:20,078
There are issues here that make
it difficult for me to do that.

500
00:19:20,113 --> 00:19:21,011
I need your help.

501
00:19:21,046 --> 00:19:22,506
What else do you know
about the Gallaghers?

502
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:24,214
- Just what I told you.
- We need more than that.

503
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,783
So put some agents on it.

504
00:19:25,818 --> 00:19:27,718
Like I said, this is complicated.

505
00:19:27,754 --> 00:19:29,453
Do you have an investigator here?

506
00:19:29,489 --> 00:19:31,689
Uh, one. For the whole office.

507
00:19:31,724 --> 00:19:33,728
I've heard that there is more than
one agent in the FBI, though.

508
00:19:33,764 --> 00:19:34,892
Is that true?

509
00:19:34,927 --> 00:19:36,594
Maybe there's more history,

510
00:19:36,629 --> 00:19:39,193
an earlier altercation between
the Gallaghers and Nancy.

511
00:19:39,228 --> 00:19:41,555
Right. Those rumors
about Nancy selling drugs.

512
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:42,655
If we can find out who started them...

513
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,790
But didn't the principal say
there were multiple sources?

514
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:47,360
So we ask other parents,
maybe even some kids?

515
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,162
Wait, are we arguing or agreeing?

516
00:19:49,197 --> 00:19:50,381
I have no idea.

517
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:52,398
Arguing.

518
00:19:52,434 --> 00:19:53,533
I'll call the principal.

519
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:55,767
See if she can help us
set up some interviews.

520
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,107
This was productive,
if highly unpleasant.

521
00:20:37,342 --> 00:20:39,142
Mr. Davis, what is your occupation?

522
00:20:39,177 --> 00:20:41,544
I'm now retired, but for 27 years,

523
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,546
I was a special agent with the FBI.

524
00:20:43,582 --> 00:20:45,481
Did you have a particular area
of expertise within the Bureau?

525
00:20:45,516 --> 00:20:46,915
I worked in counterintelligence,

526
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,118
with a focus on threats
to critical infrastructure.

527
00:20:49,153 --> 00:20:50,885
The government alleges that Ms. Huang

528
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:52,287
jeopardized national security

529
00:20:52,323 --> 00:20:54,623
by downloading site-specific PMP values.

530
00:20:54,658 --> 00:20:56,791
What is a PMP value, Agent Davis?

531
00:20:56,827 --> 00:20:58,793
Possible maximum precipitation.

532
00:20:58,829 --> 00:21:00,829
Essentially, it means the chance of rain.

533
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:04,632
Ms. Huang also allegedly downloaded HMRs.

534
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:05,733
What is an HMR, Agent Davis?

535
00:21:05,768 --> 00:21:07,635
A hydrometeorological report.

536
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,636
Weather forecast.

537
00:21:08,671 --> 00:21:09,770
How about an RVI?

538
00:21:09,805 --> 00:21:11,972
It basically is a report
on the amount of ice formed

539
00:21:12,008 --> 00:21:13,007
on a particular river.

540
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:14,108
That's it?

541
00:21:14,144 --> 00:21:15,443
Yes.

542
00:21:15,478 --> 00:21:17,245
Huh. Okay.

543
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,479
Agent Davis, in your view,

544
00:21:18,515 --> 00:21:21,615
would the distribution of any
of the data Ms. Huang downloaded

545
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,416
from the National
Water Distribution Database

546
00:21:23,452 --> 00:21:25,619
jeopardize national security?

547
00:21:25,654 --> 00:21:26,653
No.

548
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:32,925
Agent Davis, you have familiarity
with the Chinese government's

549
00:21:32,961 --> 00:21:35,028
espionage efforts
in this country, correct?

550
00:21:35,063 --> 00:21:38,664
Objection. Mr. Davis is here
to testify about infrastructure.

551
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:41,167
Mr. Davis was put up as an
expert in counterintelligence.

552
00:21:41,202 --> 00:21:42,701
I'm entitled to ask him about that.

553
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:44,803
I'll allow it. Sir, you may answer.

554
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:46,505
- Yes.
- Isn't it true, Agent Davis,

555
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,641
that when China cultivates
someone residing in this country

556
00:21:48,676 --> 00:21:50,042
for use in espionage programs,

557
00:21:50,077 --> 00:21:51,810
it is generally someone born in China,

558
00:21:51,845 --> 00:21:53,511
fluent in the language and customs,

559
00:21:53,547 --> 00:21:55,730
and who still maintains
broad and deep ties to China?

560
00:21:55,765 --> 00:21:56,757
Yes.

561
00:21:56,792 --> 00:21:57,882
Isn't it true, Agent Davis,

562
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:00,552
that newly cultivated spies often begin

563
00:22:00,587 --> 00:22:02,987
with more mundane kinds
of intelligence-gathering

564
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:05,557
in order to test their
capability and visibility?

565
00:22:05,592 --> 00:22:06,491
Yes.

566
00:22:06,526 --> 00:22:08,526
So the mere fact
that this scientific data

567
00:22:08,562 --> 00:22:10,227
might have been
of relatively minimal value

568
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,529
doesn't necessarily tell us anything

569
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:15,365
about whether Ms. Huang
is operating as an agent

570
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:16,700
of the Chinese government?

571
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,223
Objection! Prejudicial!

572
00:22:18,258 --> 00:22:20,136
Your Honor, Ms. Chavez is making
the outrageous suggestion...

573
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,289
- Overruled.
- That just because

574
00:22:21,314 --> 00:22:22,406
Ms. Huang was born in China...

575
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:23,640
Overruled.

576
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:26,677
You may answer.

577
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:28,010
That is correct.

578
00:22:28,045 --> 00:22:29,157
I do not know if Ms. Huang

579
00:22:29,192 --> 00:22:31,208
is an agent of the Chinese government.

580
00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:33,182
I suppose she could be.

581
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:44,593
How's it going
with your fancy private school?

582
00:22:44,628 --> 00:22:46,060
I don't know if I like these parents

583
00:22:46,096 --> 00:22:47,729
or opposing counsel less.

584
00:22:47,764 --> 00:22:48,863
Do you have to choose?

585
00:22:48,898 --> 00:22:51,199
I guess not.

586
00:22:52,436 --> 00:22:54,336
I brought you these.

587
00:22:54,371 --> 00:22:55,837
Silver.

588
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,443
- You okay?
- I have a job offer.

589
00:23:02,478 --> 00:23:05,279
You<i> were</i> going after Max Gillespie's
job in Public Corruption.

590
00:23:05,314 --> 00:23:06,513
In Texas.

591
00:23:08,651 --> 00:23:09,950
What?

592
00:23:09,985 --> 00:23:11,707
Solicitor General.

593
00:23:12,154 --> 00:23:14,888
Y-You have an offer

594
00:23:14,923 --> 00:23:17,224
to be the Solicitor General of Texas?

595
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,126
I'm only a few years younger than
Ted Cruz was when he had the job.

596
00:23:20,161 --> 00:23:21,728
And I think I'd be better.

597
00:23:21,763 --> 00:23:23,929
So you're gonna take it?

598
00:23:23,965 --> 00:23:25,220
I don't know.

599
00:23:26,801 --> 00:23:28,701
What do you think I should do?

600
00:23:30,805 --> 00:23:34,474
I... think you should do
what you want to do.

601
00:23:34,509 --> 00:23:37,983
Yes, but what do<i> you</i> think I should do?

602
00:23:38,412 --> 00:23:39,778
Honestly.

603
00:23:43,984 --> 00:23:46,251
I have no opinion about it. Honestly.

604
00:23:46,287 --> 00:23:48,420
But I'm happy for you...

605
00:23:50,357 --> 00:23:52,123
if it's what you want.

606
00:23:55,127 --> 00:23:57,628
Well, I just wanted to let you know.

607
00:24:00,533 --> 00:24:02,500
Congratulations, Leonard.

608
00:24:22,057 --> 00:24:24,122
Do you want to toss it, or should I?

609
00:24:27,061 --> 00:24:28,594
You okay?

610
00:24:31,165 --> 00:24:33,232
I should get up.

611
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,233
Have you been here all night?

612
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:05,596
I broke the microwave at 4:15.

613
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:07,097
It was intentional.

614
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:08,407
I'm sorry.

615
00:25:10,102 --> 00:25:12,452
- You need to get some sleep, Sandy.
- Mnh-mnh.

616
00:25:15,506 --> 00:25:17,473
I am going to lose.

617
00:25:17,508 --> 00:25:20,008
You're not. Stop saying that.

618
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,111
I am.

619
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:23,839
I am.

620
00:25:24,682 --> 00:25:26,682
I am going to lose.

621
00:25:26,718 --> 00:25:29,151
Because this jury
is going to look at Alice

622
00:25:29,186 --> 00:25:31,119
and they are going to listen to Alice

623
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,256
and they are going to think,

624
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:34,322
"Spy. She is from China. She's a spy."

625
00:25:34,358 --> 00:25:36,157
And it doesn't matter what I say,

626
00:25:36,192 --> 00:25:38,092
because what I'm saying,
I'm not saying very well,

627
00:25:38,128 --> 00:25:39,794
because I'm pissed off...

628
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,162
Listen to me.

629
00:25:41,197 --> 00:25:43,164
It's okay to be angry.

630
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:45,032
But it is not your fault that Alice Huang

631
00:25:45,068 --> 00:25:47,534
shared data that she wasn't supposed to.

632
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,970
It's not your fault that she
lied to the government about it.

633
00:25:50,005 --> 00:25:53,340
And it is not your fault that
Mohammed Fayed was found guilty.

634
00:25:53,376 --> 00:25:55,842
It<i> is</i> my fault. Don't say that.

635
00:25:55,878 --> 00:25:58,211
Please don't say that. Because it is.

636
00:25:58,247 --> 00:25:59,446
It<i> is</i> my fault.

637
00:25:59,482 --> 00:26:02,349
I was there to protect him,
and I did not!

638
00:26:02,385 --> 00:26:04,184
I did not protect him!

639
00:26:09,857 --> 00:26:11,324
I Di...

640
00:26:22,569 --> 00:26:24,469
It's wrong, Al.

641
00:26:26,507 --> 00:26:28,737
What's happening to her.

642
00:26:29,843 --> 00:26:33,144
She is being treated unfairly.

643
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:35,046
So tell them that.

644
00:26:37,284 --> 00:26:39,183
Tell them that, Sandy.

645
00:26:43,088 --> 00:26:45,489
Ms. Cappelli, you had
the cubicle adjacent to Alice's

646
00:26:45,525 --> 00:26:47,157
at the USGS Water Science Center?

647
00:26:47,193 --> 00:26:49,059
That's right. For over two years.

648
00:26:49,094 --> 00:26:52,062
When she asked you for the
password and login instructions

649
00:26:52,097 --> 00:26:54,498
to the National Water Distribution
Database, did you give it to her?

650
00:26:54,534 --> 00:26:56,497
- Yes.
- Was that a difficult decision?

651
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:58,368
It wasn't a decision at all, really.

652
00:26:58,403 --> 00:27:00,337
People share these passwords
all the time.

653
00:27:00,372 --> 00:27:02,739
I borrowed one
before I had one of my own.

654
00:27:02,774 --> 00:27:06,008
It wasn't considered a big deal, until...

655
00:27:06,044 --> 00:27:07,276
U-Until when?

656
00:27:07,312 --> 00:27:08,911
Until Alice used it.

657
00:27:10,248 --> 00:27:12,281
Mr. Jorgensen,
what is your area of expertise

658
00:27:12,317 --> 00:27:13,682
at the Geological Survey?

659
00:27:13,718 --> 00:27:16,084
I'm the Deputy Assistant Chief
of Engineers.

660
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:17,219
And you've worked closely

661
00:27:17,254 --> 00:27:18,787
with foreign governments in this area?

662
00:27:18,823 --> 00:27:21,590
Primarily Norway.
I was born and educated there.

663
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:24,560
In the past 18 months, how many
trips have you made to Norway

664
00:27:24,595 --> 00:27:25,961
in a professional capacity?

665
00:27:25,996 --> 00:27:26,962
Four trips.

666
00:27:26,997 --> 00:27:28,319
Did you ever share any data

667
00:27:28,354 --> 00:27:30,519
from the National
Water Distribution Database

668
00:27:30,554 --> 00:27:32,400
with the Norwegian government
on those trips?

669
00:27:32,435 --> 00:27:33,726
Yes. A lot.

670
00:27:33,762 --> 00:27:35,297
Was the USGS aware of this?

671
00:27:35,332 --> 00:27:39,206
Yes. I was given a commendation
for the work I did with Norway.

672
00:27:39,242 --> 00:27:41,376
As Chief Security Officer, you enforce

673
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:44,311
all United States Geological
Survey rules and procedures,

674
00:27:44,347 --> 00:27:46,247
as well as maintain all IT records?

675
00:27:46,282 --> 00:27:47,247
That's correct.

676
00:27:47,282 --> 00:27:48,596
According to your records,

677
00:27:48,631 --> 00:27:50,884
how many USGS employees
have downloaded data from

678
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,987
the National Water Distribution
Database in the last year?

679
00:27:54,022 --> 00:27:55,054
67.

680
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,290
How many have been investigated,
to your knowledge?

681
00:27:57,325 --> 00:27:59,292
One. Alice.

682
00:28:07,034 --> 00:28:09,167
Is this a bad time? I... I can come back.

683
00:28:09,203 --> 00:28:10,870
Is everything okay?

684
00:28:12,339 --> 00:28:14,006
I hope so.

685
00:28:15,228 --> 00:28:18,411
What I'm about to do is...
unprofessional...

686
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:19,978
- Okay.
- Inappropriate,

687
00:28:20,014 --> 00:28:23,458
and has a high likelihood
of making me seem like a fool.

688
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,557
You're not really selling it.

689
00:28:24,593 --> 00:28:25,784
I love you.

690
00:28:29,355 --> 00:28:30,354
Seth...

691
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,824
I'm not scared of you
beating me in a courtroom.

692
00:28:32,859 --> 00:28:34,926
I don't think you're controlling.

693
00:28:34,961 --> 00:28:37,828
I think... I was insecure,

694
00:28:37,863 --> 00:28:39,696
and you wanted me to be a better person.

695
00:28:39,732 --> 00:28:41,031
And I am now.

696
00:28:41,066 --> 00:28:43,166
I've done the work. I have changed.

697
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:44,301
A lot.

698
00:28:44,336 --> 00:28:46,670
Except for the fact that
I'm still in love with you.

699
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:51,174
- This is a lot.
- I know.

700
00:28:51,209 --> 00:28:53,343
And I'm not trying to overwhelm you.

701
00:28:53,378 --> 00:28:55,210
I'm not proposing.

702
00:28:55,246 --> 00:28:57,613
I'm not saying
we should move in together.

703
00:28:57,649 --> 00:29:00,282
I'm not saying we should do anything.

704
00:29:00,318 --> 00:29:02,485
I just want you to know how I feel

705
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,020
and that I'd like you
to give me another chance.

706
00:29:08,192 --> 00:29:10,159
This is what I wanted to say.

707
00:29:15,332 --> 00:29:16,877
How do I look?

708
00:29:16,912 --> 00:29:17,876
What?

709
00:29:17,911 --> 00:29:19,167
Do I look like a prosecutor?

710
00:29:19,202 --> 00:29:21,331
You know? Tightly wound. Judgmental.

711
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:22,519
Huge stick up my...

712
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:24,339
Principal Hatcher! Nice to meet you.

713
00:29:24,374 --> 00:29:25,841
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

714
00:29:25,876 --> 00:29:27,308
Minor crisis with the new kiln.

715
00:29:27,344 --> 00:29:28,959
Please.

716
00:29:29,512 --> 00:29:31,846
We're hoping you can shed
some light on the relationship

717
00:29:31,881 --> 00:29:34,882
between Nancy Martin
and Michael and Dana Gallagher.

718
00:29:34,917 --> 00:29:36,484
The Gallaghers?

719
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:38,085
They... Hm.

720
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,386
How do I put this?

721
00:29:39,421 --> 00:29:41,021
They hated her?

722
00:29:41,056 --> 00:29:43,390
Well, "hate" might be too strong a word.

723
00:29:43,425 --> 00:29:44,705
But they certainly didn't want her

724
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,158
to be head of the Parents' Association?

725
00:29:46,194 --> 00:29:47,440
Well, you have to understand,

726
00:29:47,476 --> 00:29:49,562
Michael and Dana both
went to Whitley themselves.

727
00:29:49,598 --> 00:29:51,898
They're very invested in its identity.

728
00:29:51,933 --> 00:29:53,733
And the head of the Parents' Association,

729
00:29:53,768 --> 00:29:55,368
well, for all intents and purposes,

730
00:29:55,403 --> 00:29:57,269
that person becomes
the face of the school

731
00:29:57,305 --> 00:29:58,811
for the period of their tenure.

732
00:29:58,847 --> 00:30:00,607
What's wrong with Nancy
being the face of the school?

733
00:30:00,642 --> 00:30:02,875
Well, she'd have a great deal
of contact with our funders,

734
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,457
most of whom are alumni.

735
00:30:04,492 --> 00:30:07,278
And alumni appreciate
a certain history of the school.

736
00:30:07,314 --> 00:30:08,463
A culture.

737
00:30:08,498 --> 00:30:10,482
Nancy Martin, while she did manage

738
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:12,417
to charm quite a few
of the other parents,

739
00:30:12,452 --> 00:30:14,720
did not reflect that culture.

740
00:30:14,755 --> 00:30:17,455
The rumors about Nancy dealing drugs...

741
00:30:17,491 --> 00:30:19,124
do you think there's any chance

742
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:20,558
they were started by the Gallaghers?

743
00:30:20,593 --> 00:30:22,426
I can't imagine.

744
00:30:22,461 --> 00:30:24,662
Let me just say, Nancy Martin was the one

745
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:27,498
who had the ecstasy
in the back seat of her car.

746
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:30,467
Even if the Gallaghers
did help spread some rumors,

747
00:30:30,503 --> 00:30:33,148
obviously, they weren't unwarranted.

748
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,940
Why don't you suggest some families.

749
00:30:36,975 --> 00:30:39,342
We can dig them up. We're good.

750
00:30:39,377 --> 00:30:41,310
I mean, we can't just sit here and
badger the woman all day, can we?

751
00:30:41,346 --> 00:30:42,345
She's got a job to do.

752
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,613
- I ha...
- Come on. Up, up, up.

753
00:30:43,649 --> 00:30:45,081
Thank you, Principal Hatcher.

754
00:30:45,116 --> 00:30:46,416
Thank you.

755
00:30:50,656 --> 00:30:52,488
Hey.

756
00:30:52,524 --> 00:30:53,956
What the hell are you doing?

757
00:30:53,991 --> 00:30:55,123
Did you hear that?

758
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:58,427
She said ecstasy was found
in the back seat of Nancy's car.

759
00:30:58,462 --> 00:30:59,674
Uh-huh. It was.

760
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,630
And how did Principal Hatcher know that?

761
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:03,999
Because that information
hasn't been publicly released.

762
00:31:04,035 --> 00:31:05,534
It wasn't in the indictment.

763
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:08,370
Nobody knows that. Except us.

764
00:31:08,405 --> 00:31:09,838
You think she planted the drugs?

765
00:31:09,874 --> 00:31:11,439
I think she planted the drugs.

766
00:31:15,144 --> 00:31:16,343
Are we gonna hug?

767
00:31:16,379 --> 00:31:17,946
God, no.

768
00:31:17,981 --> 00:31:19,047
Okay. Cool.

769
00:31:21,317 --> 00:31:26,487
Alice Huang grew up in Hebei
province in Central China.

770
00:31:26,522 --> 00:31:28,989
She studied at Jilin University,

771
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,891
moved to the United States
when she was 20,

772
00:31:30,926 --> 00:31:34,027
got her M.Sc. with
a concentration in Hydrology

773
00:31:34,063 --> 00:31:35,669
at Stony Brook...

774
00:31:36,364 --> 00:31:38,632
and fell in love with America.

775
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:40,533
She is a mother of two boys.

776
00:31:40,569 --> 00:31:43,570
She's a board member
at her local Boys & Girls Club.

777
00:31:43,606 --> 00:31:44,870
She likes Drake.

778
00:31:44,906 --> 00:31:47,539
She's a long-suffering Knicks fan.

779
00:31:47,575 --> 00:31:50,225
She is a New Yorker.

780
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:53,395
She is an American.

781
00:31:54,415 --> 00:31:56,314
Why is she here?

782
00:31:57,284 --> 00:31:58,900
Why are<i> you</i> here?

783
00:31:59,587 --> 00:32:02,988
Is it because Alice borrowed a password?

784
00:32:03,023 --> 00:32:05,490
You heard the testimony
of Jennifer Cappelli.

785
00:32:05,525 --> 00:32:09,027
Passwords are shared
all the time in Alice's office.

786
00:32:09,062 --> 00:32:11,096
Is it because Alice downloaded data

787
00:32:11,131 --> 00:32:14,065
from the National
Water Distribution Database?

788
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:18,086
66 other people downloaded
the same data last year.

789
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,339
Why is she here?

790
00:32:22,241 --> 00:32:24,300
Why are<i> you</i> here?

791
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:29,179
Is it because Alice
exchanged scientific data

792
00:32:29,214 --> 00:32:32,082
with a colleague from another country?

793
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:36,218
Jonas Jorgensen exchanged
the exact same data

794
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,587
in the exact same way.

795
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,589
He was rewarded.

796
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,361
She was arrested.

797
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:45,762
Why is she here?

798
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,764
Why are<i> you</i> here?

799
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:51,567
One of the great misunderstandings

800
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,101
of the American criminal justice system

801
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,803
is that it is a search for the truth.

802
00:32:54,838 --> 00:32:55,976
It is not.

803
00:32:56,011 --> 00:32:57,973
When the judge gives you his instructions

804
00:32:58,008 --> 00:33:00,542
and you head back to that jury room,

805
00:33:00,577 --> 00:33:03,465
you will not be asked
to return with the truth.

806
00:33:04,281 --> 00:33:07,582
You will be asked only
to return with a verdict.

807
00:33:07,617 --> 00:33:10,718
"Guilty" or "Not guilty."

808
00:33:10,753 --> 00:33:13,821
Did the Government meet
its burden of proof or not?

809
00:33:13,856 --> 00:33:17,058
I believe the evidence
is clear that it did not.

810
00:33:17,093 --> 00:33:21,733
I believe the evidence is clear
that Alice Huang is not guilty.

811
00:33:22,498 --> 00:33:24,431
But the truth also matters here.

812
00:33:24,466 --> 00:33:25,599
So let's tell the truth.

813
00:33:25,634 --> 00:33:30,670
The truth is, she is here,
you are here, we are all here,

814
00:33:30,706 --> 00:33:32,338
because she is not<i> from</i> here.

815
00:33:32,373 --> 00:33:35,474
That is why we are here.
That is the dark truth.

816
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,480
And what you do...

817
00:33:41,516 --> 00:33:44,714
here, now...

818
00:33:45,686 --> 00:33:50,553
that will either be
a light out of this darkness...

819
00:33:51,792 --> 00:33:56,195
or this is where we will stay.

820
00:34:04,026 --> 00:34:05,125
Hey.

821
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,428
The indictment against
Principal Hatcher. Just filed.

822
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:08,829
Excellent!

823
00:34:08,864 --> 00:34:10,431
I don't have to defend her, do I?

824
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:11,665
Unlikely.

825
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:15,156
But if you did, she'd be in good hands.

826
00:34:15,191 --> 00:34:16,831
- That sounded like a...
- I always thought you'd be

827
00:34:16,856 --> 00:34:18,462
a good lawyer if you tried.

828
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,159
You're trying.

829
00:34:22,184 --> 00:34:23,717
There's something about the way you talk

830
00:34:23,742 --> 00:34:25,209
that makes me feel bad inside.

831
00:34:25,234 --> 00:34:27,234
And yet, I like it, too.

832
00:34:27,515 --> 00:34:31,016
I guess... that's just honesty.

833
00:34:40,231 --> 00:34:41,863
I understand you've reached
a unanimous verdict.

834
00:34:41,899 --> 00:34:43,899
- Is that correct?
- Yes, Your Honor.

835
00:34:45,936 --> 00:34:49,654
In the case of
United States vs. Alice Huang,

836
00:34:50,273 --> 00:34:53,774
we the jury find the defendant,
Alice Huang,

837
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:57,245
not guilty of espionage
against the United States.

838
00:35:35,149 --> 00:35:37,182
I told you you were gonna win.

839
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,417
I told you.

840
00:35:38,453 --> 00:35:39,854
You never told me that.

841
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:41,319
Well, I thought it.

842
00:35:41,355 --> 00:35:42,654
What are you still doing here?

843
00:35:42,689 --> 00:35:44,021
Come on!

844
00:35:44,057 --> 00:35:45,624
I didn't win.

845
00:35:45,659 --> 00:35:48,159
That's a win. Trust me.

846
00:35:48,194 --> 00:35:49,380
Fayed.

847
00:35:50,997 --> 00:35:52,467
No.

848
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:54,802
Not that.

849
00:35:55,469 --> 00:35:56,467
You still might.

850
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:58,802
I should've done better. More.

851
00:35:58,837 --> 00:36:01,171
This proves that.
If I could do it over again...

852
00:36:01,206 --> 00:36:04,275
If you could do it over, Sandra,
you would probably lose again.

853
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:06,042
Because this job is hard,

854
00:36:06,078 --> 00:36:09,346
and you need to find a way
to give yourself a break.

855
00:36:09,382 --> 00:36:11,382
This relentlessness, this intensity,

856
00:36:11,417 --> 00:36:14,651
this quest for perfection...

857
00:36:14,686 --> 00:36:16,686
it is what will make you truly great,

858
00:36:16,721 --> 00:36:19,422
but it can also break you.

859
00:36:21,393 --> 00:36:24,827
Do not let it break you.

860
00:36:31,502 --> 00:36:33,669
Okay.

861
00:36:33,704 --> 00:36:36,838
Listen. I've been doing
a lot of research about Texas,

862
00:36:36,873 --> 00:36:39,675
and here is what I know about Texas.

863
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,310
First, you will have to live in Austin.

864
00:36:41,345 --> 00:36:43,645
- Everybody loves Austin.
- Precisely my point.

865
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:45,880
It's one of the fastest-growing
cities in America.

866
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:47,548
- Is that a positive?
- It's exhausting.

867
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:50,318
People in Austin spend more time
waiting in line for food

868
00:36:50,353 --> 00:36:52,486
- than any other city in America.
- You're insane.

869
00:36:52,522 --> 00:36:54,154
Well, maybe<i> I</i> should
move to Austin, then,

870
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:57,325
where thousands of insane people
stand on a bridge

871
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,093
waiting for bats
to fly out at dusk every night.

872
00:37:00,129 --> 00:37:03,864
Now, look, I like animals
as much as anyone. But bats?

873
00:37:05,149 --> 00:37:06,199
Here is a list

874
00:37:06,234 --> 00:37:08,768
of other things I know you hate

875
00:37:08,804 --> 00:37:12,238
that you can expect a lot of in Austin.

876
00:37:12,273 --> 00:37:16,209
100-degree days... Austin had 73 in 2011.

877
00:37:16,244 --> 00:37:17,377
No pro sports.

878
00:37:17,412 --> 00:37:19,045
Very few black people.

879
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,213
Cricket swarms.

880
00:37:20,248 --> 00:37:24,750
The never-changing reality
that it is surrounded by Texas.

881
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:25,851
Also, the worst cities

882
00:37:25,886 --> 00:37:29,105
are the ones that also double
as people's first names.

883
00:37:29,757 --> 00:37:31,423
Think about it.

884
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:33,726
Seven presidents have come from New York.

885
00:37:33,761 --> 00:37:34,760
Three from Texas.

886
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:35,927
You'd be much better off

887
00:37:35,963 --> 00:37:37,830
starting your political career here.

888
00:37:41,167 --> 00:37:43,901
Listen, you've always trusted me

889
00:37:43,936 --> 00:37:48,072
to help you weigh decisions,
to guide you,

890
00:37:48,107 --> 00:37:50,460
give you cold analytical...

891
00:37:51,944 --> 00:37:53,143
analysis.

892
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:56,212
And... you should stay.

893
00:38:00,986 --> 00:38:03,787
There is one more thing on this list.

894
00:38:03,822 --> 00:38:06,392
The truth is, this...

895
00:38:07,659 --> 00:38:09,793
could have been the entire list.

896
00:38:13,297 --> 00:38:15,398
I will miss you...

897
00:38:18,269 --> 00:38:19,402
so much.

898
00:38:26,343 --> 00:38:28,080
I already said yes.

899
00:38:29,346 --> 00:38:30,578
To the job.

900
00:38:34,451 --> 00:38:35,750
- If I had known...
- No.

901
00:38:37,554 --> 00:38:39,353
No.

902
00:38:39,389 --> 00:38:41,552
It's a good decision.

903
00:38:42,358 --> 00:38:43,721
It makes sense.

904
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,059
You can... forget all this.

905
00:38:48,431 --> 00:38:49,530
Will you stay?

906
00:38:49,565 --> 00:38:51,364
We never really made a tradition

907
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,333
out of Hand Pulled Noodle House #3.

908
00:38:53,368 --> 00:38:55,335
I have to go.

909
00:39:38,444 --> 00:39:40,110
Don't tell me you love me.

910
00:39:40,145 --> 00:39:41,078
I don't.

911
00:39:41,113 --> 00:39:42,346
Good.

912
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:45,649
You do look fine, though.
I will say that.

913
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:01,924
Sorry, it's just...

914
00:40:02,601 --> 00:40:04,801
I could really use someone to talk to.

915
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:06,302
It's okay.

916
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:07,805
Allison?

917
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:09,472
Yeah.

918
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:10,573
Oh.

919
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:12,143
I, uh...

920
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,543
I understand.

921
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:20,048
Have you seen "Rocky IV"?

922
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:21,717
- No.
- It's the best one.

923
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:24,620
Okay. Sure.

924
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:25,821
You okay?

925
00:41:23,843 --> 00:41:25,810
You are worthy.

926
00:41:30,667 --> 00:41:36,553

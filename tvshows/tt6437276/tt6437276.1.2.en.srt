00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,838
Leonard: Roger!

645
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:35,940
My mother came by for lunch
and wanted to say hi.

646
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,409
- Senator Knox. A pleasure.
- All mine.

647
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:40,712
I hope my son is doing
an adequate job for you,

648
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:42,847
but if he's not,
promise you'll never show him

649
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:45,016
any special favor just because of me.

650
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,191
- Deal?
- Deal.

651
00:24:46,225 --> 00:24:47,505
If anything, I'll make it
even harder on him.

652
00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:49,287
- How about that?
- [Chuckles] Perfect.

653
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,055
The next time you're in D.C.,

654
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,258
call me, and we'll have dinner.

655
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:54,392
It's a date.

656
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:59,464
You told me you just wanted
to show me where you work,

657
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,099
not parade me around for your boss.

658
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:03,735
He needs to know I can be an asset here.

659
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,040
And that I might have a few

660
00:25:05,065 --> 00:25:07,105
- power moves up my sleeve, too.
- [Elevator bell dings]

661
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:08,406
Oh, baby.

662
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:12,443
Calling your mommy is never a power move.

663
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,587
"Rahowa."

664
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,122
What's that?

665
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:25,957
"Racial holy war."

666
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,577
It's what we train for.

667
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:30,995
The first priority is to restore
the white Christian state,

668
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,098
which means organizing for total
war against the other races

669
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:37,001
when they rise in solidarity
with the global order.

670
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:40,338
Who dies will come down to them or us.

671
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,040
And it won't be us.

672
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,410
[Sighs]

673
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:49,747
No, we use human trafficking

674
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:52,150
to get Dr. Rollins
to plead guilty on the opioids.

675
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:53,685
We already have human trafficking.

676
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,153
That has to beat opioids.

677
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:57,755
- Roger wanted opioids.
- Human... trafficking.

678
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,291
- Is not opioids.
- You are killing me.

679
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:02,493
On your report card, where it
said "works well with others,"

680
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:04,362
did you <i>ever</i> get a check by that?

681
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,930
Man: Hey. I ran her name.

682
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:08,499
No presence in the U.S.
after she got here.

683
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:09,801
Look at what else.

684
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:11,804
Roger: $150 million.

685
00:26:11,838 --> 00:26:13,938
A housekeeper worth $150 million?

686
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:16,374
She's also the C.E.O.
of three shell corporations

687
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,643
in the Caymans, the Dutch
West Indies, and Guadalupe.

688
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:21,045
The doctor opened the offshore
accounts in her name.

689
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,780
I'm guessing this probably
gets me off probation.

690
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:24,524
Even though it isn't opioids.

691
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,318
Yes, it is.

692
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:29,112
- What?
- Bank of the West Indies

693
00:26:29,146 --> 00:26:31,656
is also where the Sonesta Cartel
parks its money.

694
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,125
If our Dr. Rollins isn't
laundering money for them,

695
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,127
then it's one hell of a coincidence.

696
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,563
Okay. So...

697
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,065
we just connected this doctor
to a major drug cartel.

698
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,348
When this case is over,

699
00:26:42,383 --> 00:26:44,669
I'm buying each of you a very tall plant.

700
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:51,009
You sure this is gonna work?

701
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,148
We're gonna let you be you.

702
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:02,654
Hallway... now.

703
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,891
[Sighs]

704
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:09,093
- He looks like a Nazi.
- He <i>is</i> a Nazi.

705
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:11,195
You told me you didn't want him
to look like a Nazi

706
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,497
so you could make your case to the jury.

707
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:13,998
That was your strategy.

708
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:15,166
If you're tanking this defense...

709
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,368
I <i>was</i> tanking it. I was.

710
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:19,871
Not on purpose, but <i>I</i> found him guilty...

711
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:21,272
in here.

712
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,241
Tried and sentenced him
just like a jury would've

713
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:25,343
based on his looks, his views,

714
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:28,079
and if I'm honest with myself
and honest with you...

715
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:30,181
which, given the way
you're looking at me right now,

716
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,250
is much, much, much more important...

717
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:36,120
my strategy was really about
lightening his sentence.

718
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:38,089
Look at his awful childhood, listen
to these character witnesses...

719
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:41,793
Tell me you have an actual plan
to defend the Nazi

720
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,594
you just hauled into that courtroom.

721
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:45,263
Carl Wayne Clarke is on trial

722
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:47,765
for attempting to kill
Assemblywoman McCray.

723
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,269
I don't have to convince
the jury he's a great guy.

724
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:53,938
I just have to convince the jury
he didn't shoot her.

725
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:55,807
And when I stopped trying to turn
him into America's sweetheart,

726
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,376
I realized there's more than
a reasonable doubt

727
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,611
he pulled that trigger.

728
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:02,146
I have a case.

729
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,281
Trust me.

730
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:07,285
To win this, I need him
to look the way he really looks.

731
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,287
Then I can ride this sucker
all the way to a bear claw.

732
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:11,956
I can do this.

733
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:13,633
I <i>want</i> to do this.

734
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,327
I'm his lawyer.

735
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,281
Ms. Carter, the shots that were
fired at Assemblywoman McCray

736
00:28:23,315 --> 00:28:25,250
- came from in front of you.
- Yes.

737
00:28:25,284 --> 00:28:27,018
- So you were <i>behind</i> the shooter.
- Yes.

738
00:28:27,052 --> 00:28:28,920
Then how were you so sure, from behind,

739
00:28:28,954 --> 00:28:31,356
that it was Mr. Clarke
who pulled the trigger?

740
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:33,791
I mean... he kinds of stands out.

741
00:28:33,826 --> 00:28:35,026
He's unique.

742
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,494
Yes... unique.

743
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:37,716
Ms. Carter...

744
00:28:39,031 --> 00:28:43,501
every one of these men was
present at the rally that day.

745
00:28:43,536 --> 00:28:46,237
Do you also find their looks unique?

746
00:28:47,806 --> 00:28:50,041
Right after the gunshots,
I saw him running away.

747
00:28:50,075 --> 00:28:52,277
- Did you see anyone else run away?
- Yeah.

748
00:28:52,311 --> 00:28:54,812
And what did <i>you</i> do
when you heard gunshots?

749
00:28:54,847 --> 00:28:56,481
Did you go towards the victim?

750
00:28:56,515 --> 00:28:58,220
Uh, no, I ran away.

751
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,622
Ms. Waldron, who is "All American Bitch"?

752
00:29:04,657 --> 00:29:06,024
Oh. Me.

753
00:29:06,058 --> 00:29:08,359
I mean, not me.
That's me on social media.

754
00:29:09,562 --> 00:29:12,964
Do you recall posting
this image of the candidate?

755
00:29:12,998 --> 00:29:14,499
I <i>reposted</i> it. That's different.

756
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:16,067
Were you at the rally
the day of the shooting?

757
00:29:16,101 --> 00:29:17,068
Yes, I was.

758
00:29:17,102 --> 00:29:18,970
And do you own a gun?

759
00:29:19,004 --> 00:29:21,706
- Well, yes, but I have...
- Thank you. That's all.

760
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,474
Your Honor, we concede that Ms. Ledesma

761
00:29:23,509 --> 00:29:25,543
failed to timely file
her discrimination claim

762
00:29:25,578 --> 00:29:28,012
against her landlord, Mr. Carlyle,

763
00:29:28,047 --> 00:29:30,848
but the reasons she was delayed
are material...

764
00:29:30,883 --> 00:29:33,151
the blocked exit doors,
the rotting staircase,

765
00:29:33,185 --> 00:29:35,386
the fact that Ms. Ledesma
was forced to carry

766
00:29:35,421 --> 00:29:38,222
her special-needs child down
those rotting stairs

767
00:29:38,257 --> 00:29:40,058
because the building does not have ramps,

768
00:29:40,092 --> 00:29:42,060
railings, or a working elevator...

769
00:29:42,094 --> 00:29:45,029
in clear violation of the
Americans with Disabilities Act.

770
00:29:45,064 --> 00:29:47,999
Ms. Ledesma was five minutes
late to the courthouse that day

771
00:29:48,033 --> 00:29:49,334
because she spent <i>15</i> minutes

772
00:29:49,368 --> 00:29:51,336
on the second-floor landing
of her building,

773
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:55,106
trying to convince her son
that they needed to keep moving.

774
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,008
He was scared of all the rats.

775

Negligent absentee landlords,
like Mr. Carlyle,

776
00:30:00,245 --> 00:30:02,780
have no connection
to the human beings they house.

777
00:30:02,815 --> 00:30:04,882
They can force evictions
as a way to raise rents

778
00:30:04,917 --> 00:30:07,251
without any regard
for the families torn apart,

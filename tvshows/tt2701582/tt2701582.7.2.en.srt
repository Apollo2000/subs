You wanna poke about in my house,

about one of your supporters.

145

Young man called Gary Radowicz.
Also calls himself Rogers.

146
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:37,964
Doesn't ring a bell.

147
00:09:37,965 --> 00:09:40,165
He was at the talk that
you gave on Monday night.

148
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,916
Was he? Mm.
I really couldn't say.

149

each and every one of those

sympathetic to the cause,
you understand.

151
00:09:46,246 --> 00:09:47,604
There was a lot of people there.

152
00:09:47,605 --> 00:09:50,245
A lot of people are very concerned
about the state of our country.

153
00:09:50,246 --> 00:09:52,525
Well, we're very concerned
about young Pakistani lads

00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:54,943
getting knifed on the street.

155

Terrible.

156
00:09:56,685 --> 00:09:59,845
But...
I can't say that I'm surprised.

157

00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,045
Sounds like a threat, Mr Gorman.

161
00:10:09,046 --> 00:10:10,564
It's just an observation.

162
00:10:10,565 --> 00:10:12,765
If the police
can't keep the streets safe

163
00:10:12,766 --> 00:10:16,964
and defend the indigenous population
against outsiders, well...

164
00:10:16,965 --> 00:10:19,805
...no wonder people take it
into their own hands.

165
00:10:19,806 --> 00:10:23,806
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got a seat to win.

166
00:10:28,806 --> 00:10:30,646
Ah, Thursday.

167
00:10:30,685 --> 00:10:33,019
- Morning, sir.
- Morse. Sir.

168
00:10:34,406 --> 00:10:36,724
Division have been asking about
this Jakobsson case,

169
00:10:36,725 --> 00:10:38,684
the cook at the working men's club.

170
00:10:38,685 --> 00:10:41,285
We've got two women
who've positively identified him

171
00:10:41,286 --> 00:10:43,564
as the man who's been exposing
himself along the river.

172
00:10:43,565 --> 00:10:45,925
- But beyond that... - Random attacks,
as far as we can make out.

173
00:10:45,926 --> 00:10:47,765
Robbery doesn't appear
to have been a motive.

174
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:50,005
- What about last night's stabbing?
- We've got a name.

175
00:10:50,006 --> 00:10:52,964
Juvenile. 15 years old.
Gerwazy Radowicz.

176
00:10:52,965 --> 00:10:54,604
What's that? Polish, is it?

177
00:10:54,605 --> 00:10:57,285
On his father's side.
AKA, Gary Rogers.

178
00:10:57,286 --> 00:11:00,324
- He runs with this racialist crowd.
- You're bringing him in, presumably.

179
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:03,324
If we can find him.
At school, according to his mother.

180
00:11:03,325 --> 00:11:05,204
Though, if he was involved
last night,

181
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:07,405
I'd be surprised
if he turned up for assembly,

182
00:11:07,406 --> 00:11:08,444
but we'll take a look.

183
00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:10,805
I see, well, keep me apprised
of any developments.

184
00:11:10,806 --> 00:11:14,045
The last thing we need is a public
order issue in Election Week.

185
00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:15,125
Sorry to interrupt, sir.

186
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:17,125
Couldn't do us a favour,
could you, matey?

187
00:11:17,126 --> 00:11:19,645
- I've got court in an hour.
- What's this? More about last night?

188
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:20,844
No, sir. Something else.

189
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:22,805
Missing person,
according to Uniform.

190
00:11:22,806 --> 00:11:25,325
I see. Very well. Carry on.

191
00:11:26,725 --> 00:11:30,309
I'll take the school,
if you want to... Sir.

192
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:36,765
- Good afternoon, Mrs...?
- Her name is Aziz.

193
00:11:36,766 --> 00:11:38,964
She doesn't speak English.
That's why I'm here.

194
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:40,564
Mrs Sardar. Nuha Sardar.

195
00:11:40,565 --> 00:11:42,005
Detective Sergeant Morse.

196
00:11:42,006 --> 00:11:44,285
A missing persons case,
my colleague said.

197
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:47,285
Mrs Aziz's husband. He delivers food
for my father-in-law's restaurant.

198
00:11:47,286 --> 00:11:48,405
The Jolly Rajah?

199
00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:50,645
He left the restaurant
just after 11 last night

200
00:11:50,646 --> 00:11:52,925
with his final delivery run,
and never came home.

201
00:11:52,926 --> 00:11:55,125
And how had he been lately?
Anything worrying him?

202
00:11:55,126 --> 00:11:58,045
- She said he'd not been himself.
- In what way?

203
00:11:58,046 --> 00:12:03,296
He had something on his mind,
but couldn't tell her what it was?

204
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,364
So this is
his final list of deliveries?

205
00:12:06,365 --> 00:12:08,564
- Yes.
- Just four addresses?

206
00:12:08,565 --> 00:12:09,806
That's right.

207
00:12:09,845 --> 00:12:12,324
Nobody called to say their
take-away hadn't been delivered?

208
00:12:12,325 --> 00:12:13,965
- No.
- Right.

209
00:12:15,685 --> 00:12:19,765
- Has Mr Aziz been with you long?
- A couple of years.

210
00:12:19,766 --> 00:12:22,965
- Was he a reliable driver?
- Usually.

211
00:12:24,006 --> 00:12:26,405
His wife said he seemed
to have something on his mind.

212
00:12:26,406 --> 00:12:29,324
I wondered, is there anything
that had been troubling him at work?

213
00:12:29,325 --> 00:12:30,845
No.

214
00:12:30,886 --> 00:12:34,604
I mean, he did say that
he might wish to speak with me,

215
00:12:34,605 --> 00:12:36,645
but I'm afraid I just put him off.

216
00:12:36,646 --> 00:12:38,444
Any idea
what that might've been about?

217
00:12:38,445 --> 00:12:39,965
Money.

218
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:42,964
See, his mother-in-law's coming
to live with him later this month.

219
00:12:42,965 --> 00:12:47,525
And I suppose he thought
he might get a raise out of me.

220
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:48,845
Hm.

221
00:12:48,886 --> 00:12:51,324
Can I ask who's responsible
for taking these orders?

222
00:12:51,325 --> 00:12:53,742
Would you like to see a menu?

223
00:12:54,605 --> 00:12:56,285
Perhaps a drink
while you're waiting?

224
00:12:56,286 --> 00:12:58,406
Oh, all right. All right.

225
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:01,126
THEY SPEAK IN INDIAN LANGUAGE

226
00:13:03,126 --> 00:13:05,926
I'm sorry, my brother is, er...

227
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:09,005
is not quite as in command
of his faculties as we're used to.

228
00:13:09,006 --> 00:13:10,340
He's overworked.

229
00:13:11,646 --> 00:13:13,926
Ah, I see, I was just...

230
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,925
...trying to find out
how the orders were dispatched.

231
00:13:17,926 --> 00:13:22,765
- How the route is arrived at?
- Oh, right, I see. Um, well...

232
00:13:22,766 --> 00:13:27,604
The orders are all bundled together
and sent out hourly, more or less.

233
00:13:27,605 --> 00:13:31,645
Right... But I mean,
the nearest first, presumably?

234
00:13:31,646 --> 00:13:33,646
I believe so.

235
00:13:33,685 --> 00:13:36,324
This is all organised
by my brother and Mr Aziz.

236
00:13:36,325 --> 00:13:38,992
I just take care of the kitchen.

237
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,484
MORSE: <i>Good afternoon, sir.

238
00:13:41,485 --> 00:13:45,819
<i>Did you order an Indian takeaway
yesterday evening?</i>

239
00:13:46,046 --> 00:13:48,765
Good afternoon. Detective Sergeant
Morse, Thames Valley.

240
00:13:48,766 --> 00:13:53,266
You ordered a takeaway
from The Jolly Rajah last night?

241
00:15:09,365 --> 00:15:11,526
Hello?
DOOR CREAKS

242
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,646
Hello? The police...

243
00:15:25,526 --> 00:15:26,845
Hello?

244
00:16:22,205 --> 00:16:24,565
Doctor. What have we got?

245
00:16:24,605 --> 00:16:27,765
The cause of death
would appear to be a cleaver blow

246
00:16:27,766 --> 00:16:29,564
to the back of the skull.

247
00:16:29,565 --> 00:16:31,325
No defensive wounds.

248
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,364
Blood splatter on the wall,

249
00:16:33,365 --> 00:16:37,165
and what looks to be
a print on the door frame.

250
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,750
That be the weapon?

251
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,766
I can't say exactly

252
00:16:41,806 --> 00:16:44,444
until I see
what comes back from the lab.

253
00:16:44,445 --> 00:16:46,684
That's the bloke
who delivered my curry last night.

254
00:16:46,685 --> 00:16:51,485
- About what time?
- Um... around 11?

255
00:16:51,526 --> 00:16:52,844
Whose place is this?

256
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,965
It's a man called, erm,
Oberon Prince.

257
00:16:56,006 --> 00:16:58,005
He's a cook,
according to the porter.

258
00:16:58,006 --> 00:16:59,724
Yeah. He's off the telly.

259
00:16:59,725 --> 00:17:01,684
He's got
a recipes and reviews column

260
00:17:01,685 --> 00:17:03,324
in the Oxford Mail every Saturday.

261
00:17:03,325 --> 00:17:04,726
So where is he?

262
00:17:06,085 --> 00:17:07,604
Just a few questions.

263
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:09,765
Do you know Mr Prince in number ten?

264
00:17:09,766 --> 00:17:12,644
We've said "hello" once or twice.
He's friendly enough.

265
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:14,965
- Have you lived here long?
- 18 months.

266
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:17,525
It's my dad's place. One of 'em.

267
00:17:17,526 --> 00:17:19,045
I'm going through a divorce.

268
00:17:19,046 --> 00:17:20,884
He doesn't use it much, so I...

269
00:17:20,885 --> 00:17:24,245
So you didn't see or hear
anything unusual last night?

270
00:17:24,246 --> 00:17:25,246
No.

271
00:17:25,286 --> 00:17:28,370
Well, thank you very much,
Miss Trent.

272
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:32,325
Oberon Prince.

273
00:17:32,365 --> 00:17:34,164
I've only met him a couple of times.

274
00:17:34,165 --> 00:17:35,364
He files his copy by post,

275
00:17:35,365 --> 00:17:38,005
always well in advance
of his deadline.

276
00:17:38,006 --> 00:17:40,604
Turns up at the Christmas party
once in a while.

277
00:17:40,605 --> 00:17:41,645
Family?

278
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,885
Has a wife, I think. Or had been.

279
00:17:44,925 --> 00:17:48,085
Rosemary, possibly.
One of the herbs.

280
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,924
And this is the only address
you have for him?

281
00:17:49,925 --> 00:17:51,286
Far as I know.

282
00:17:51,325 --> 00:17:54,285
There might be a holiday home
in Greece.

283
00:17:54,286 --> 00:17:57,445
I can look into it for you.
Can I get a quote?

284
00:17:57,446 --> 00:18:00,164
All right,
we're keeping an open mind.

285
00:18:00,165 --> 00:18:02,564
We welcome
the chance to speak to him

286
00:18:02,565 --> 00:18:05,364
and urge him to contact us
at the earliest opportunity.

287
00:18:05,365 --> 00:18:09,565
Well, I've an inquest to attend
once I'm done here,

288
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:11,884
but I'll see
it makes the late edition.

289
00:18:11,885 --> 00:18:15,205
- Anyone we know?
- Farmer out towards Wytham.

290
00:18:15,206 --> 00:18:17,365
Drowned in the pigswill.

291
00:18:17,405 --> 00:18:19,844
You know,
this is the sixth freak accident

292
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:22,245
I've attended in as many months.

293
00:18:22,246 --> 00:18:25,805
All relatively healthy.
All in their 30s or 40s. All single.

294
00:18:25,806 --> 00:18:27,525
- Hm?
- Half a dozen in half a year?

295
00:18:27,526 --> 00:18:30,364
Hardly what you'd call an epidemic.

296
00:18:30,365 --> 00:18:32,865
Well, you know best, I'm sure.

297
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,966
See you later.
CAR DOOR CLOSES

298
00:18:45,206 --> 00:18:49,124
Sir. The food for the third delivery
on his list is still in his car.

299
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,685
- How's that?
- It's, er, 14 Mendip Gardens West.

300
00:18:51,686 --> 00:18:55,245
Nah, there's a Mendip Gardens North
and a Mendip Gardens South,

301
00:18:55,246 --> 00:18:57,045
but no West.
Nor East, for that matter.

302
00:18:57,046 --> 00:18:59,005
Could the restaurant
have taken it down wrong?

303
00:18:59,006 --> 00:19:00,084
Well, it's possible.

304
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:03,124
The proprietor's
an, erm, Uqbah Sardar.

305
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,884
According to his brother, he's been
a little off his game recently.

306
00:19:05,885 --> 00:19:08,124
You'd have thought
if someone's supper didn't turn up,

307
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,604
they might've rung to complain.

308
00:19:09,605 --> 00:19:11,844
Yeah, that's what I thought,
but apparently not.

309
00:19:11,845 --> 00:19:14,084
I'd better report back
to Mr Bright.

310
00:19:14,085 --> 00:19:15,564
Can you and Jim finish up here?

311
00:19:15,565 --> 00:19:17,084
Get out a ports and airports,

312
00:19:17,085 --> 00:19:19,844
and see that Prince's photograph
is circulated.

313
00:19:19,845 --> 00:19:22,285
Oh, erm, sir,
Miss Frazil's freak accidents,

314
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,045
you don't think
there's anything in that?

315
00:19:24,046 --> 00:19:26,324
Besides a few thousand
on the circulation?

316
00:19:26,325 --> 00:19:28,992
You know what the press is like.

317
00:19:31,686 --> 00:19:34,164
Porter'd clocked
Aziz's car this morning.

318
00:19:34,165 --> 00:19:35,604
He keeps
a list of those cars he sees

319
00:19:35,605 --> 00:19:37,164
that don't have
a right to park here,

320
00:19:37,165 --> 00:19:39,005
as some of the residents
can get quite beady.

321
00:19:39,006 --> 00:19:41,205
And what did he say about him,
Prince?

322
00:19:41,206 --> 00:19:44,364
Lived here about six years.
No trouble.

323
00:19:44,365 --> 00:19:47,285
Last saw him yesterday morning
when he took him up his post.

324
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,703
Very popular with the ladies.

325
00:19:50,006 --> 00:19:55,526
So, Prince orders a take-away
and then kills the delivery driver?

326
00:19:55,565 --> 00:19:59,005
Or maybe he was on a promise
last night and never came home?

327
00:19:59,006 --> 00:20:01,205
Mr Aziz was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

328
00:20:01,206 --> 00:20:03,404
Perhaps he stumbled upon
a burglary or something?

329
00:20:03,405 --> 00:20:06,006
Anything's possible, matey.

A stabbing last night, and now this.

335
00:20:16,046 --> 00:20:19,164
- Connected, do you think?
- Nothing to say so, sir.

336
00:20:19,165 --> 00:20:21,364
Both victims are Pakistani,
aren't they?

337
00:20:21,365 --> 00:20:23,164
Yes, sir.
But that's as far as it goes.

Division will be monitoring
this situation very carefully.

340
00:20:27,286 --> 00:20:29,725
Was the victim
known to this Prince character?

341
00:20:29,726 --> 00:20:32,324
Not as we've been able
to establish yet, sir.

342
00:20:32,325 --> 00:20:34,525
Morse and me are gonna brace 'em
down the restaurant,

see if there's anything there.

344
00:20:35,885 --> 00:20:36,924
He orders an Indian meal,

345
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:38,685
and then butchers the man
who delivers it?

346
00:20:38,686 --> 00:20:40,364
What is he? A lunatic of some sort?

347
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:41,925
Food critic, sir.

348
00:20:43,486 --> 00:20:44,686
Even so.

349
00:20:44,726 --> 00:20:47,564
Taking an axe to someone's head
goes beyond expressing

350
00:20:47,565 --> 00:20:49,884
dissatisfaction with the service,
wouldn't you say?

351
00:20:49,885 --> 00:20:52,805
He's had some sort of
emotional breakdown, maybe?

352
00:20:52,806 --> 00:20:53,924
If it was him.

353
00:20:53,925 --> 00:20:56,564
Well, if it wasn't,
you'd imagine he'd come forward

354
00:20:56,565 --> 00:21:00,805
as soon as he hears his flat's

365
00:21:30,046 --> 00:21:32,765
Good afternoon, Mrs Sardar.
Might we come in?

366
00:21:32,766 --> 00:21:34,085
Yes, of course.

367
00:21:39,885 --> 00:21:43,565
It's the police. About Mr Aziz.

368
00:21:43,605 --> 00:21:46,525
Detective Chief Inspector Thursday,
Thames Valley.

369
00:21:46,526 --> 00:21:47,965
I believe you met my colleague.

370
00:21:47,966 --> 00:21:52,446
Yes. Yes, of course.
My nephews, Dr Farook Sardar

371
00:21:52,486 --> 00:21:54,084
and his young brother, Salim.

372
00:21:54,085 --> 00:21:56,084
- You found him?
- We did, sir.

373
00:21:56,085 --> 00:21:59,805
And I'm sorry to say
it's not good news, he's deceased.

374
00:21:59,806 --> 00:22:02,306
And it wasn't a natural death.

375
00:22:03,446 --> 00:22:05,196
What? Another attack?

376
00:22:07,405 --> 00:22:10,445
Well, we can't speculate
at this stage, sir.

377
00:22:10,446 --> 00:22:12,285
His car was found
outside a block of flats

378
00:22:12,286 --> 00:22:15,203
called Tiffin Court.
Do you know it?

379
00:22:16,006 --> 00:22:18,205
- No.
- I've never heard of it.

380
00:22:18,206 --> 00:22:21,084
Did Mr Aziz have any enemies,
as far as you know?

381
00:22:21,085 --> 00:22:23,645
No, he was... mildest of men.

382
00:22:23,686 --> 00:22:26,324
No trouble with any
of the customers, nothing like that?

383
00:22:26,325 --> 00:22:28,324
No, he saw nothing of the customers,

384
00:22:28,325 --> 00:22:31,205
only walking through the restaurant
from the kitchen

385
00:22:31,206 --> 00:22:32,404
to do his deliveries.

386
00:22:32,405 --> 00:22:34,164
And we need to speak
to your brother, sir.

387
00:22:34,165 --> 00:22:35,205
Uqbah, is it?

388
00:22:35,206 --> 00:22:37,404
Er, about a couple of orders
he took.

389
00:22:37,405 --> 00:22:39,884
The addresses appear
to have been taken down wrongly.

390
00:22:39,885 --> 00:22:42,525
I'm afraid my father's not well,
Chief Inspector.

391
00:22:42,526 --> 00:22:45,005
Recently, he's been...
having trouble with his memory,

392
00:22:45,006 --> 00:22:47,404
- his reading and writing skills.
- Well, how's that?

393
00:22:47,405 --> 00:22:49,164
Well...
For a few months,

394
00:22:49,165 --> 00:22:51,725
there's been, ah...
discrepancies when cashing up.

395
00:22:51,726 --> 00:22:54,725
He's been charging people twice over
for dishes on their bill,

396
00:22:54,726 --> 00:22:57,005
or... not ringing it up at all.

397
00:22:57,006 --> 00:22:58,805
How long as he been like this?

398
00:22:58,806 --> 00:23:01,644
It has got worse over the last year.

399
00:23:01,645 --> 00:23:03,644
We've been trying to talk to him
about doing less,

400
00:23:03,645 --> 00:23:06,525
retiring, even,
but... he won't hear of it.

401
00:23:06,526 --> 00:23:09,205
It would be helpful if
we could see a list of the customers

402
00:23:09,206 --> 00:23:10,805
- that did come in last night.
- Certainly.

403
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,965
All the information's at The Rajah.

404
00:23:12,966 --> 00:23:17,633
Ah, er, when you're ready,
we might go to the restaurant.

405
00:23:18,165 --> 00:23:20,045
Did you have many bookings?

406
00:23:20,046 --> 00:23:22,725
I suppose three-quarters
of the cover's early in the evening.

407
00:23:22,726 --> 00:23:24,765
Was there any trouble
between Mr Aziz

408
00:23:24,766 --> 00:23:26,285
and any of the other customers?

409
00:23:26,286 --> 00:23:29,124
No. There was quite a rowdy table,
but...

410
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:32,485
they had nothing to do with Mr Aziz.
Wrestlers, I think.

411
00:23:32,486 --> 00:23:34,805
- Had they booked?
- No, but they've been in before.

412
00:23:34,806 --> 00:23:35,845
Always late.

413
00:23:35,885 --> 00:23:37,725
What time did you close up
last night?

414
00:23:37,726 --> 00:23:39,644
I closed the kitchen at 11.

415
00:23:39,645 --> 00:23:41,485
My brother had a bit of a turn.

416
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:44,084
So we called Farook
and he took him home.

417
00:23:44,085 --> 00:23:45,725
And then Salim followed on
in his car,

418
00:23:45,726 --> 00:23:49,725
and I... shut up the restaurant
at, er, just after 12.

419
00:23:49,726 --> 00:23:52,725
So you were alone?
Would that be usual?

420
00:23:52,726 --> 00:23:57,286
Oh! First in, last out. Chef's lot.

421
00:23:57,325 --> 00:24:00,285
Ah, the counterfoils,
for the credit card and the cheques.

422
00:24:00,286 --> 00:24:02,525
Which were the addresses
you were having trouble with?

423
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:06,924
Tiffin Court, it was 10, not 1C.
And, er, Mendip Gardens West.

424
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:10,084
Maybe my brother
wrote it down wrongly.

425
00:24:10,085 --> 00:24:13,164
Well...
thank you for your assistance.

426
00:24:13,165 --> 00:24:15,525
We'll return these
as soon as possible.

427
00:24:15,526 --> 00:24:17,193

435
00:25:20,405 --> 00:25:22,246
Well, I was concerned.

436
00:25:22,286 --> 00:25:24,805
I hoped he might have turned up,
come back,

437
00:25:24,806 --> 00:25:26,205
then all this could be explained.

438
00:25:26,206 --> 00:25:29,124
And when did you see him last,
Mr Prince?

439
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:31,164
I haven't seen him for a while.

440
00:25:31,165 --> 00:25:34,925
But we speak... on the telephone,
every week.

441
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,550
Do you mind if I...

442
00:25:37,165 --> 00:25:39,765
I know it's a little early,
but to steady my nerves.

443
00:25:39,766 --> 00:25:42,765
Have you any idea where he might be?
There's talk of a place in Greece.

444
00:25:42,766 --> 00:25:45,324
And a suitcase of his
appears to be missing.

445
00:25:45,325 --> 00:25:48,575
Well, he does have a little place
there.

446
00:25:49,325 --> 00:25:50,644
Well, who was he?

447
00:25:50,645 --> 00:25:52,966
He was a delivery man...

448
00:25:53,006 --> 00:25:56,285
from a restaurant
called The Jolly Rajah.

449
00:25:56,286 --> 00:25:59,285
Did he ever mentioned
a man called Aziz? Iqbal Aziz?

450
00:25:59,286 --> 00:26:00,806
No. Never.

451
00:26:00,845 --> 00:26:02,285
Does that seem in keeping to you?

452
00:26:02,286 --> 00:26:04,124
That he would order food
to be delivered.

453
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:06,286
Indian, certainly.

454
00:26:06,325 --> 00:26:08,164
We never touched it
on the programme.

455
00:26:08,165 --> 00:26:10,765
- Sorry, the programme?
- "Et Voila".

456
00:26:10,766 --> 00:26:13,445
We started together.
On the television.

457
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,124
It was my Johnny to his Fanny.

458
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:17,966
Oh, it was 15 years ago, nigh on.

459
00:26:18,006 --> 00:26:19,766
The Dark Ages.

460
00:26:19,806 --> 00:26:23,205
Most people had barely heard
of vinaigrette, huh!

461
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,766
Look...

462
00:26:24,806 --> 00:26:28,644
whatever you think he's done,
you're quite wrong.

463
00:26:28,645 --> 00:26:32,285
Only he has his faults,
but this is far beyond his scope.

464
00:26:32,286 --> 00:26:34,203
It's way too grotesque.

465
00:26:35,206 --> 00:26:37,564
If you don't mind me asking,
what happened between you?

466
00:26:37,565 --> 00:26:39,232
Oh, it was my fault.

467
00:26:40,246 --> 00:26:43,725
I never cared for
the sticky side of married life.

468
00:26:43,726 --> 00:26:47,245
We looked at other couples,
they might've had the physical side,

469
00:26:47,246 --> 00:26:49,924
but most of them could barely stand
the sight of each other

470
00:26:49,925 --> 00:26:51,125
half the time.

471
00:26:51,165 --> 00:26:54,445
We had something
they could only dream of...

472
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,446
companionship.

473
00:26:56,486 --> 00:26:59,403
And he was the most tremendous fun.

474
00:27:00,006 --> 00:27:03,006
Right up until
the sixth whisky sour.

475
00:27:03,446 --> 00:27:05,685
Then things could turn
a little... ugly.

476
00:27:05,686 --> 00:27:07,186
So what, he drank?

477
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:11,844
He drank. He gambled.
But I never stopped loving him.

478
00:27:11,845 --> 00:27:13,512
Was he ever violent?

479
00:27:15,286 --> 00:27:16,565
On occasion.

480
00:27:16,605 --> 00:27:21,855
But I don't believe he's capable
of anything that happened here.

481
00:27:23,046 --> 00:27:25,525
I can't. It's not the best time.

482
00:27:25,526 --> 00:27:27,125
I can't talk now.

483
00:27:28,206 --> 00:27:31,040
I agree, there's a lot to discuss.

484
00:27:31,286 --> 00:27:32,703
I can't help you.

485
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:34,966
Sorry.

486
00:27:35,006 --> 00:27:36,090
Who was that?

487
00:27:37,885 --> 00:27:39,046
Wrong number.

488
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:13,419
You don't think
we could've got it wrong, do you?

489
00:28:13,978 --> 00:28:15,619
I know, but...

490
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:16,826
two murders...

491
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:22,898
...Molly Andrews, Tony Jakobsson...
on the same stretch of Tow path?

492
00:28:22,899 --> 00:28:24,618
For fear of
sounding like a broken record,

493
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:27,378
I think
a man getting his throat cut,

494
00:28:27,379 --> 00:28:31,257
is a world apart
from a woman having her neck broken.

495
00:28:31,258 --> 00:28:34,858
We've got who killed
Molly Andrews and Naomi Bedford,

496
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:36,418
he's on remand in Farley.

497
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:38,098
Unless you wanted to drop
all charges

498
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:41,099
and have him back out on the street.

499
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:46,138
How'd you make out at Prince's flat?

500
00:28:46,139 --> 00:28:48,297
Met his wife. Well, his first wife.

501
00:28:48,298 --> 00:28:50,497
Still seems to carry
something of a torch for him.

502
00:28:50,498 --> 00:28:51,977
- What was she doing there?
- Same as us,

503
00:28:51,978 --> 00:28:53,257
wants to know where Prince is.

504
00:28:53,258 --> 00:28:54,977
- Shed any light?
- No.

505
00:28:54,978 --> 00:28:56,895
But I did turn this up.

506
00:29:00,899 --> 00:29:02,498
- Gambler.
- Mm.

507
00:29:02,538 --> 00:29:06,538
Something of a drinker, too,
and violent with it.

508
00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:08,858
Nothing from Ports and Airports

509
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:10,618
on flight manifests
or passenger lists.

510
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:13,138
If he's already gone,
he's done it under a different name.

511
00:29:13,139 --> 00:29:15,618
But he's from the television,
isn't he?

512
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:17,577
Be difficult for someone like that

513
00:29:17,578 --> 00:29:19,898
to slip out of the country
unnoticed, I'd have thought.

514
00:29:19,899 --> 00:29:21,537
Unless he's changed his appearance?

515
00:29:21,538 --> 00:29:23,977
Anything from Forensics
on the bloody thumb print

516
00:29:23,978 --> 00:29:25,138
found at Tiffin Court?

517
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:26,577
No match for Oberon Prince.

518
00:29:26,578 --> 00:29:29,057
What about the Greek Inn,
that place he's got out there?

519
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:30,578
Vrakonisi?

520
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:34,297
Locals have been up to the villa,
but no sign of life.

521
00:29:34,298 --> 00:29:37,465
- You, ah, seen the latest?
- Oh, yeah.

522
00:29:40,818 --> 00:29:42,985
Still think it wasn't him?

523
00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:04,459
SHE SOBS

524
00:30:11,459 --> 00:30:14,419
OPERA MUSIC PLAYS

525
00:30:17,978 --> 00:30:20,419
DOOR BUZZES

526
00:30:29,219 --> 00:30:31,218
Morse, it's been too long!

527
00:30:31,219 --> 00:30:33,218
I've been wandering
the Mediterranean

528
00:30:33,219 --> 00:30:35,138
with my, how do you say it,
"My cap in my hand"?

529
00:30:35,139 --> 00:30:37,058
My beggar's bowl.

530
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:40,458
- Begging bowl.
- All in a good cause, I assure you.

531
00:30:40,459 --> 00:30:43,658
Seeking donations for
my family's charitable foundation.

532
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:46,378
The only relief I got
was that Steve was there,

533
00:30:46,379 --> 00:30:48,698
- making a picture.
- Steve who?

534
00:30:48,699 --> 00:30:50,859
McQueen. Yes, it's funny.

535
00:30:50,899 --> 00:30:53,257
The only real person, out of
any of them, should be an actor.

536
00:30:53,258 --> 00:30:55,977
But I have been
unforgivably neglectful,

537
00:30:55,978 --> 00:30:58,338
and that's why I'm here.

538
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:00,658
To rectify matters
and deserve your forgiveness.

539
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,898
- There's nothing needs forgiving.
- You're very kind.

540
00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:04,898
But one should keep
the friendships that matter

541
00:31:04,899 --> 00:31:06,218
in good repair, don't you think?

542
00:31:06,219 --> 00:31:07,498
I've never...

543
00:31:07,538 --> 00:31:10,658
I've never really thought about it
that way.

544
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:14,659
I left messages at your work
before we went away.

545
00:31:14,859 --> 00:31:16,178
Come for supper tomorrow.

546
00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:19,017
Violetta has forsaken me once again.

547
00:31:19,018 --> 00:31:21,352
I'm in need of good company.

548
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:26,777
- Well, I can't promise that.
- Well, you sell yourself too short.

549
00:31:26,778 --> 00:31:28,619
Now, a drink, I think.

550
00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:30,619
I took the liberty.

551
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:32,658
What is this we're listening to?

552
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:35,099
La Cura Per L'Amore. Tregola.

553
00:31:35,139 --> 00:31:38,659
Ah! Well, in that case,
"Due bicchieri".

554
00:31:43,219 --> 00:31:45,699
The police have gone.

555
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:48,322
There's nobody here... only me.

556
00:31:50,738 --> 00:31:51,939
I miss you.

557
00:31:53,298 --> 00:31:56,965
Why don't you come round
and keep me company?

558
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:42,498
WHISTLING

559
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:19,778
Miss! Bridget, isn't it?

560
00:33:19,818 --> 00:33:21,537
Come, come out of the rain.

561
00:33:21,538 --> 00:33:23,459
THUNDER RUMBLES

562
00:33:25,298 --> 00:33:27,977
You wanna be careful
walking along at night like this.

563
00:33:27,978 --> 00:33:31,395
- It's not safe.
- I don't have far to go.

564
00:33:31,699 --> 00:33:36,116
Takes me back to my days
on the beat. Well, on Nights.

565
00:33:36,258 --> 00:33:40,675
I used to like Nights.
Especially after a bit of rain.

566
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,618
Oh, Win told me
all about the wrestling.

567
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:45,939
Yeah! We had a great time.

568
00:33:45,978 --> 00:33:49,257
Oh, I'm all right from here,
Mr Thursday.

569
00:33:49,258 --> 00:33:52,592
Oh, all right, then.
You mind how you go.

570
00:34:00,099 --> 00:34:02,379
WHISTLING

571
00:34:23,898 --> 00:34:27,058
Oh... you were in India,
Mrs Bright said.

572
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:29,898
Yes, yes. Before the war. Hm, yes.

573
00:34:29,938 --> 00:34:31,937
- Whereabouts?
- Oh, here and there.

574
00:34:31,938 --> 00:34:35,179
Calcutta, Pankot, Chandrapore.

575
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:38,469
- And yourself?
- Oxford, born and bred.

576
00:34:39,258 --> 00:34:40,898
Yes, well...

577
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:44,098
...I was very sad to go.

578
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:45,458
We both were.

579
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,969
- Goodnight, sir.
- Ah, goodnight.

580
00:34:59,938 --> 00:35:03,499
Oh... He's very handsome,
don't you think?

581
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:06,289
Oh, yes. Very handsome, I'm sure.

582
00:35:08,738 --> 00:35:11,179
Are you jealous, Puli?

583
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,179
Desperately.

584
00:35:20,258 --> 00:35:24,659
- He says I'm doing much better.
- Good.

585
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,619
See, I told you.

586
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:32,418
You have to have... faith.

587
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:40,219
OLD MAN MUMBLING

588
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:46,979
What's he doing?

589
00:35:50,738 --> 00:35:52,155
Looking for Ammi.

590
00:35:53,858 --> 00:35:54,942
Sleepwalking.

591
00:35:55,938 --> 00:35:57,099
I don't know.

592
00:35:57,139 --> 00:36:00,556
I thought
Farook could give him something.

593
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:11,398
You were late tonight,
from the restaurant.

594
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:13,378
Stock take.

595
00:36:25,979 --> 00:36:28,219
OLD MAN GRUNTS

596
00:36:34,738 --> 00:36:37,539
HE MUTTERS
IN INDIAN LANGUAGE

597
00:37:04,418 --> 00:37:06,978
- And when did you see him last?
- When he went to bed.

598
00:37:06,979 --> 00:37:10,499
- What time was that?
- About ten o'clock.

599
00:37:10,539 --> 00:37:12,817
We heard him walking about
afterwards.

600
00:37:12,818 --> 00:37:14,417
And how did he seem?

601
00:37:14,418 --> 00:37:18,618
He had been very anxious.
About what happened to Mr Aziz.

602
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:21,257
What happened? You were
meant to be looking after him.

603
00:37:21,258 --> 00:37:24,658
- I've told him.
- You don't tell me anything.

604
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,138
We will get a description
circulated to all patrol cars

605
00:37:27,139 --> 00:37:28,618
and beat officers.

606
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:30,579
Try not to worry.

607
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:33,337
What about
the Oberon Prince case, Morse?

608
00:37:33,338 --> 00:37:36,578
- Anything on the ports and airports?
- Nothing, sir.

609
00:37:36,579 --> 00:37:37,659
Sir...

610
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:42,578
- He was at the restaurant that night.
- Which restaurant?

611
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:44,498
- Jolly Rajah.
- Who was? Prince?

612
00:37:44,499 --> 00:37:46,257
Well, that can't be right.

613
00:37:46,258 --> 00:37:49,018
Moniker here on his credit card slip
says different, matey.

614
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:50,817
But if he'd already eaten
at the restaurant,

615
00:37:50,818 --> 00:37:53,318
why would he order a takeaway?

616
00:37:54,059 --> 00:37:56,938
Oh, yes. Yes, he was here.

617
00:37:56,979 --> 00:38:01,297
In fact, he had words with that
rowdy table I was telling you about.

618
00:38:01,298 --> 00:38:04,465
- Party of eight.
- Mr Nayle, was that?

619
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:07,599
Yeah, that sounds about right.

620
00:38:16,499 --> 00:38:19,897
- MORSE: <i>Still no sign of Gary.
- And Prince?

621
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:23,898
<i>Maybe Stanley Nayles boys
can shed some light.</i>

622
00:38:33,499 --> 00:38:36,219
- How's Mrs Aziz?
- Terrible.

623
00:38:36,258 --> 00:38:38,457
I gave her something
to help her sleep.

624
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:39,937
Her kids are with her.

625
00:38:39,938 --> 00:38:43,018
This country,
it's not a place for us.

626
00:38:43,019 --> 00:38:45,737
- They don't want us here.
- You shouldn't talk like that.

627
00:38:45,738 --> 00:38:47,488
This is our home now.

628
00:38:48,258 --> 00:38:50,842
You heard there was a stabbing.

629
00:38:50,858 --> 00:38:54,138
One of our young men on the street.
That's our home.

630
00:38:54,139 --> 00:38:58,457
- That's how welcome we are.
- Did you help the police?

631
00:38:58,458 --> 00:39:03,538
I think so. They were asking about
a man called, er, Oberon Prince.

632
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:07,377
I know him. He's off the television,
he's a chef.

633
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:08,659
What about him?

634
00:39:08,699 --> 00:39:12,658
That's who Mr Aziz
was delivering to at Tiffin Court.

635
00:39:12,659 --> 00:39:15,578
And they think he did it,
this Prince?

636
00:39:15,579 --> 00:39:18,079
He's gone missing, apparently.

637
00:39:20,219 --> 00:39:22,457
If he tries to turn that
into a Half-Nelson,

638
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:24,178
you know what to do,
drop it right down...

639
00:39:24,179 --> 00:39:25,979
Stanley Nayle?

640
00:39:26,019 --> 00:39:27,539
Yes, gents.

641
00:39:27,579 --> 00:39:29,777
DCI Thursday, DS Morse,
Thames Valley.

642
00:39:29,778 --> 00:39:32,337
You ate in The Jolly Rajah in Oxford
on Monday night.

643
00:39:32,338 --> 00:39:34,897
Yeah, after we'd finished
at the venue.

644
00:39:34,898 --> 00:39:36,658
We heard you had words
with another patron.

645
00:39:36,659 --> 00:39:38,909
A man called Oberon Prince.

646
00:39:39,738 --> 00:39:41,417
He was taking the mickey.

647
00:39:41,418 --> 00:39:44,897
I told him to knock it off,
but he was drunk, you know.

648
00:39:44,898 --> 00:39:47,457
- He got a bit lippy with us.
- So what did you say?

649
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:50,098
Don't know.
I suppose I just said,

650
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:52,297
"Knock it off, mate,"
or summat like that.

651
00:39:52,298 --> 00:39:53,817
You know, nothing heavy.

652
00:39:53,818 --> 00:39:55,857
- So you didn't threaten him?
- No.

653
00:39:55,858 --> 00:39:58,058
That's not Bobby's part,
in the ring or out.

654
00:39:58,059 --> 00:40:00,257
And when you left the restaurant,
where do you go?

655
00:40:00,258 --> 00:40:01,817
Well, it was getting late by then.

656
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:03,297
Most of us
just went back to our digs.

657
00:40:03,298 --> 00:40:05,817
- Where would that be?
- We're all over.

658
00:40:05,818 --> 00:40:08,257
Ones and twos.
Couple of us here, couple there.

659
00:40:08,258 --> 00:40:10,925
Not everyone's keen on having...

660
00:40:11,418 --> 00:40:13,297
...wrestlers under their roof.

661
00:40:13,298 --> 00:40:16,777
You said "most" of you?
Some of you didn't, presumably?

662
00:40:16,778 --> 00:40:18,978
Well, I think a couple of the lads
went on to a drinker

663
00:40:18,979 --> 00:40:21,257
we sometimes go to.
Adam and the Noble Brothers.

664
00:40:21,258 --> 00:40:22,778
Adam?

665
00:40:22,818 --> 00:40:25,659
Adam, "Dangerman", Sloane.

666
00:40:25,699 --> 00:40:27,618
- And where's he?
- He tops the bill,

667
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:28,978
so he's not with us tonight.

668
00:40:28,979 --> 00:40:31,337
Stan, our gaffer,
wanted him to rest up.

669
00:40:31,338 --> 00:40:33,337
Well, we'll need addresses
for their lodgings.

670
00:40:33,338 --> 00:40:35,337
Well, I'll have to check
my paperwork.

671
00:40:35,338 --> 00:40:36,777
All right if I phone it through?

672
00:40:36,778 --> 00:40:39,538
Look, there's some B&Bs we use
on a semi-regular,

673
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:40,737
whenever we're in town,

674
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:43,098
but I'll have to check and see
who was where.

675
00:40:43,099 --> 00:40:44,618
Some of the lads double up, but...

676
00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:47,786
I will have a look, let you know,
yeah?

677
00:40:52,139 --> 00:40:56,389
- You ever go to the wrestling?
- What do you think?

678
00:40:58,219 --> 00:40:59,719
"Faces and heels."

679
00:41:00,778 --> 00:41:03,362
That's what the Yanks call 'em.

680
00:41:03,418 --> 00:41:07,897
Like the white hats and the black
in the cowboy pictures.

681
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:10,338
Good guys and villains.

682
00:41:10,378 --> 00:41:12,045
Just like the opera.

683
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:16,978
It's the "face" in a bout
the punters can root for.

684
00:41:16,979 --> 00:41:19,979
The "heel" gives 'em someone to boo.

685
00:41:21,418 --> 00:41:23,418
Sir. Morse.

686
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:27,125
Your warrant came through
for Mrs Radowicz's.

687
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:38,297
He's entitled to his opinion,
the same as anybody else.

688
00:41:38,298 --> 00:41:39,737
They're just not like us.

689
00:41:39,738 --> 00:41:42,058
In what way are they not like us,
Mrs Radowicz?

690
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:43,418
All ways.

691
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:44,937
They don't talk the way we do

692
00:41:44,938 --> 00:41:46,817
and they make a noise
till all hours,

693
00:41:46,818 --> 00:41:50,257
coming and going,
and their food smells funny.

694
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,578
- Their food smells funny?
- Well, it does!

695
00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:54,897
But you wouldn't know about that
because people like you

696
00:41:54,898 --> 00:41:56,698
don't have to live
on the same street as them.

697
00:41:56,699 --> 00:41:59,777
Look, do you want to see your Gary
get into even more trouble

698
00:41:59,778 --> 00:42:02,528
and end up in Borstal?
DOOR CLOSES

699
00:42:02,818 --> 00:42:05,402
- Shh, stay there!
- GARY: <i>Mum?'

700
00:42:20,027 --> 00:42:22,667
- Smoke?
- No.

701
00:42:23,788 --> 00:42:25,547
Before we start,

702
00:42:25,587 --> 00:42:27,907
we've got witnesses
can put you at the scene

703
00:42:27,908 --> 00:42:29,106
at the time in question,

704
00:42:29,107 --> 00:42:32,026
so, before you answer,
you might like to think about that.

705
00:42:32,027 --> 00:42:35,026
I wasn't there.
I don't care what anybody says.

706
00:42:35,027 --> 00:42:36,227
Who else was there, Gary?

707
00:42:36,228 --> 00:42:38,666
I wouldn't know, would I?
Seeing as I wasn't there.

708
00:42:38,667 --> 00:42:41,908
Look, it's easy to follow the pack.

709
00:42:41,947 --> 00:42:46,364
Older boys, men, you wanna fit in,
be one of the lads.

710
00:42:47,027 --> 00:42:49,361
Tell us about Martin Gorman.

711
00:42:49,708 --> 00:42:50,867
What about him?

712
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:53,227
- Well, you like him.
- I'm not a queer.

713
00:42:53,228 --> 00:42:55,466
I mean... you admire him, then.

714
00:42:55,467 --> 00:42:57,907
- He talks sense.
- About what?

715
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,908
About the foreigners. Immigration.

716
00:43:00,947 --> 00:43:03,268
The blacks. Pakis.

717
00:43:03,308 --> 00:43:04,867
Coming over here,
taking all the jobs

718
00:43:04,868 --> 00:43:07,066
- and the houses and that.
- What, you don't care for them?

719
00:43:07,067 --> 00:43:09,466
I don't care for
people ruining my country, no.

720
00:43:09,467 --> 00:43:11,666
Is that why you stuck a knife
in one of the Asian lads?

721
00:43:11,667 --> 00:43:13,417
I didn't stab anyone.

722
00:43:15,067 --> 00:43:16,228
Gary Rogers.

723
00:43:17,547 --> 00:43:19,147
What's that about?

724
00:43:19,188 --> 00:43:21,387
You wanna go round my school
with a Polish name.

725
00:43:21,388 --> 00:43:24,888
- See what it gets you.
- You were bullied?

726
00:43:25,067 --> 00:43:27,947
Gerwazy Radowicz.

727
00:43:27,987 --> 00:43:29,506
You had that hanging
round your neck,

728
00:43:29,507 --> 00:43:31,267
you'd call yourself Gary Rogers
an' all.

729
00:43:31,268 --> 00:43:34,428
I'm British... not Polish.

730
00:43:34,467 --> 00:43:36,026
How'd your parents feel about that?

731
00:43:36,027 --> 00:43:37,827
What I call myself
is none of her business.

732
00:43:37,828 --> 00:43:39,587
And your father?

733
00:43:39,627 --> 00:43:40,907
Died. When I was five.

734
00:43:40,908 --> 00:43:43,408
- Oh, sorry.
- There's no need.

735
00:43:43,428 --> 00:43:46,227
- He's nothing to me.
- He should be.

736
00:43:46,228 --> 00:43:48,868
- Why?
- He's your father.

737
00:43:48,908 --> 00:43:51,307
You never knew him.
She only took up with him

738
00:43:51,308 --> 00:43:53,347
for the money
she could screw out of him.

739
00:43:53,348 --> 00:43:58,268
Look... I didn't stab anyone.
I wasn't there,

740
00:43:58,308 --> 00:43:59,907
and you can't put a knife
in my hand.

741
00:43:59,908 --> 00:44:01,547
No, we can't.

742
00:44:01,587 --> 00:44:03,626
But we do have
a group of Asian lads,

743
00:44:03,627 --> 00:44:06,387
who can pick you out of a line-up,
and they will pick you out, Gary.

744
00:44:06,388 --> 00:44:07,472
KNOCK ON DOOR

745
00:44:08,987 --> 00:44:09,987
Sir?

746
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:21,466
But I thought
this boy had been recognised.

747
00:44:21,467 --> 00:44:23,146
Well, no,
the eyewitness who named him

748
00:44:23,147 --> 00:44:24,787
now isn't sure it was Gary
after all.

749
00:44:24,788 --> 00:44:26,986
They've withdrawn
their earlier statement.

750
00:44:26,987 --> 00:44:28,827
Someone put the frighteners on,
you think?

751
00:44:28,828 --> 00:44:29,828
Maybe.

752
00:44:29,868 --> 00:44:32,066
But whatever the cause,
we've had to let him go.

753
00:44:32,067 --> 00:44:34,506
OFFICER: Sarge, the Sardar family
are asking for an update.

754
00:44:34,507 --> 00:44:36,174
I'd better get that.

755
00:44:37,627 --> 00:44:40,986
Never the buggers
that load the gun, is it?

756
00:44:40,987 --> 00:44:44,907
- How's that? - Always the ones
that pull the trigger.

757
00:44:44,908 --> 00:44:48,026
That tripe-hound,
Gorman's every bit as responsible

758
00:44:48,027 --> 00:44:51,427
for the stabbing as the boy was,
filling his head full of rubbish.

759
00:44:51,428 --> 00:44:54,187
But nothing ever sticks
to those bastards.

760
00:44:54,188 --> 00:44:56,787
British Movement.
He's a movement, all right.

761
00:44:56,788 --> 00:44:58,986
May have been Gorman
who put the knife into his hand,

762
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:01,506
but it was Gary that stuck it
into another human being.

763
00:45:01,507 --> 00:45:06,187
- A boy not so different from himself.
- Different enough.

764
00:45:06,188 --> 00:45:08,466
Boy doesn't know what he is yet.

765
00:45:08,467 --> 00:45:10,884
Whether he's coming or going.

766
00:45:11,027 --> 00:45:14,307
English, Polish, growing up
for the most part without a father.

767
00:45:14,308 --> 00:45:17,225
- Everybody has a choice.
- Do they?

768
00:45:18,147 --> 00:45:21,387
I just hope the lad sees sense
about Gorman and his kind.

769
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:23,067
Got time for a pint?

770
00:45:23,107 --> 00:45:25,691
Um... No, I can't, not tonight.

771
00:45:25,708 --> 00:45:27,958
- Oh, no? Date, is it?
- Hm.

772
00:45:28,748 --> 00:45:31,082
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

773
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:00,507
Morse, good to see you!

774
00:46:01,627 --> 00:46:02,946
- Hello.
- Welcome.

775
00:46:02,947 --> 00:46:03,947
Ludo?

776
00:46:05,868 --> 00:46:10,868
Oh, I spoke prematurely.
La bella signora has returned to me.

777
00:46:11,428 --> 00:46:13,827
Perhaps you should think
of flying a flag.

778
00:46:13,828 --> 00:46:14,947
Hello again.

779
00:46:14,987 --> 00:46:16,908
Hello.

780
00:46:16,947 --> 00:46:18,946
To indicate
that she is in residence, yes?

781
00:46:18,947 --> 00:46:21,781
- Like Her Majesty.
- Exactly that.

782
00:46:22,748 --> 00:46:25,427
You've been in Monaco, Ludo says.

783
00:46:25,428 --> 00:46:27,627
Monaco. Antibes.

784
00:46:27,667 --> 00:46:28,667
Right.

785
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:31,666
Well, look, I've no wish to intrude
upon a happy reunion, so I'll...

786
00:46:31,667 --> 00:46:36,501
Nonsense, we're delighted
to see you, aren't we? Of course.

787
00:46:36,547 --> 00:46:38,964
What would you like to drink?

788
00:46:42,027 --> 00:46:43,444
Whatever's going.

789
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,908
You shoot?

790
00:46:46,188 --> 00:46:48,147
- Birds?
- No. People.

791
00:46:48,188 --> 00:46:49,307
MORSE CHUCKLES

792
00:46:49,308 --> 00:46:51,707
It's a little early for game,
isn't it?

793
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,708
Come. Come.

794
00:46:53,748 --> 00:46:56,228
Pull!
HE SHOOTS GUN TWICE

795
00:46:58,748 --> 00:47:00,667
Did you see, darling?

796
00:47:00,708 --> 00:47:03,026
- Did you see that wonderful shot?
- I saw.

797
00:47:03,027 --> 00:47:05,828
How is the world of criminality?

798
00:47:05,868 --> 00:47:08,546
I read in the press about
Oberon Prince. Can that be right?

799
00:47:08,547 --> 00:47:10,747
- Yeah. Do you know him?
- Slightly.

800
00:47:10,748 --> 00:47:13,867
All right, I suppose.
He's no Robert Danvers.

801
00:47:13,868 --> 00:47:16,307
- What's this?
- Someone was murdered.

802
00:47:16,308 --> 00:47:18,187
This Prince fellow is suspect.

803
00:47:18,188 --> 00:47:19,772
Will you catch him?

804
00:47:19,788 --> 00:47:22,986
I expect so. Sooner or later.
LUDO CHUCKLES

805
00:47:22,987 --> 00:47:24,666
What a blood-soaked life you lead.

806
00:47:24,667 --> 00:47:27,067
Pull!
HE SHOOTS TWICE

807
00:47:28,308 --> 00:47:29,827
Yeah it's that, all right.

808
00:47:29,828 --> 00:47:32,347
No matter how many cases you solve
or bad people you put away,

809
00:47:32,348 --> 00:47:34,707
there's always another one
standing right behind them.

810
00:47:34,708 --> 00:47:36,666
There speaks a devil sick of sin.

811
00:47:36,667 --> 00:47:39,347
I just wonder if
I've stayed too long at the fair.

812
00:47:39,348 --> 00:47:42,182
Why do it, if you hate it so much?

813
00:47:43,388 --> 00:47:47,222
I suppose because
I'm no good at anything else.

814
00:47:47,788 --> 00:47:50,788
And because
the dead deserve justice.

815
00:47:51,107 --> 00:47:53,506
There's a delivery man's
lost his life

816
00:47:53,507 --> 00:47:55,867
and a... a woman left a widow.

817
00:47:55,868 --> 00:47:57,387
Life, death, rich, poor.

818
00:47:57,388 --> 00:48:01,626
It's all a roll of the dice, Morse.
There's no reason to any of it.

819
00:48:01,627 --> 00:48:03,586
They're not responsible.

820
00:48:03,587 --> 00:48:05,106
Some people are just unlucky.

821
00:48:05,107 --> 00:48:06,587
Pull!

822
00:48:06,627 --> 00:48:10,788
GUN SHOOTS TWICE

823
00:48:10,828 --> 00:48:13,026
MAN ON TV: <i>Britain already is part

824
00:48:13,027 --> 00:48:16,228
<i>of the European Trade Association.</i>

825
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:20,185
- <i>We have applied for membership...</i>
- All right?

826
00:48:21,547 --> 00:48:22,667
Fred?

827
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:29,106
Yeah, I'm gonna take
a turn round the block.

828
00:48:29,107 --> 00:48:30,748
What's up?

829
00:48:30,788 --> 00:48:31,987
Just, er...

830
00:48:33,268 --> 00:48:34,388
Just work.

831
00:48:36,147 --> 00:48:40,647
I'm here, you know,
if you want to talk about anything.

832
00:48:43,228 --> 00:48:46,547
Whatever it is, you'll put it right.

833
00:48:46,587 --> 00:48:48,147
It's what you do.

834
00:49:05,467 --> 00:49:07,551
I owe you an explanation.

835
00:49:12,947 --> 00:49:15,114
"No questions", wasn't it?

836
00:49:17,627 --> 00:49:19,946
A mere "goodbye"
might have been polite,

837
00:49:19,947 --> 00:49:21,667
but nobody died.

838
00:49:22,828 --> 00:49:24,707
You don't owe me anything.

839
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:25,875
Can I see you?

840
00:49:32,987 --> 00:49:34,404
I don't think so.

841
00:49:37,987 --> 00:49:39,228
He's a friend.

842
00:49:43,428 --> 00:49:44,707
Affairs with married women?

843
00:49:44,708 --> 00:49:48,292
I'm sorry,
it's just not my... not my scene.

844
00:49:48,748 --> 00:49:52,415
LUDO: I thought
we'd crack open the Margeaux.

845
00:49:52,428 --> 00:49:54,178
I'll leave you to it.

846
00:49:55,507 --> 00:49:59,387
It'll have to be another time,
I'm afraid. Work.

847
00:49:59,388 --> 00:50:02,467
You approve? Violetta.

848
00:50:02,507 --> 00:50:04,666
Oh, yeah, you're a lucky man.

849
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:07,626
Yes, I am.
God knows what I did to deserve her.

850
00:50:07,627 --> 00:50:09,227
If I lost her,
I don't know what I'd do.

851
00:50:09,228 --> 00:50:11,027
Then don't.

852
00:50:11,067 --> 00:50:12,987
No. I don't intend to.

853
00:50:14,188 --> 00:50:16,666
MORSE CLEARS HIS THROAT
We'll go out.

854
00:50:16,667 --> 00:50:19,001
Tannheuser at Covent Garden.

855
00:50:19,507 --> 00:50:22,066
Look, you can't be running around
London getting drunk with me.

856
00:50:22,067 --> 00:50:24,651
Your wife's back now. Take her.

857
00:50:25,947 --> 00:50:27,747
Violetta hates the opera.

858
00:50:27,748 --> 00:50:28,987
Next week!

859
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:32,777
Let's do it, come on!
Best seats in the house!

860
00:50:46,708 --> 00:50:48,587
OFFICER: Sir?

861
00:50:48,627 --> 00:50:50,868
THUNDER RUMBLES

862
00:50:59,228 --> 00:51:01,348
MAN WHIMPERS QUIETLY

863
00:51:01,388 --> 00:51:03,547
WHIMPERING CONTINUES

864
00:51:16,828 --> 00:51:18,578
HE WHIMPERS
Mr Sardar?

865
00:51:19,748 --> 00:51:23,165
- We've been looking for you.
- Oh, hello.

866
00:51:24,428 --> 00:51:26,947
I... I must go... home.

867
00:51:28,147 --> 00:51:30,947
Course, you do.

868
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:34,268
Come on. You're drenched through.

869
00:51:34,308 --> 00:51:35,475
There you are.

870
00:51:37,587 --> 00:51:41,707
You're lucky we got
a report about your wanderings.

871
00:51:41,708 --> 00:51:43,507
Anyway...

872
00:51:43,547 --> 00:51:44,947
I forget things.

873
00:51:49,308 --> 00:51:52,308
Well,
I'm... I'm sure we all do that.

874
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:56,787
I'll go into a room
and I can't remember

875
00:51:56,788 --> 00:51:58,347
what I've come in for.

876
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:00,788
Or I'll put my pipe down,

877
00:52:00,828 --> 00:52:04,868
and... damn me if I can remember
where I left it.

878
00:52:04,908 --> 00:52:08,158
It's more than that,
I can't remember...

879
00:52:09,268 --> 00:52:11,268
...words.

880
00:52:11,308 --> 00:52:12,667
I...

881
00:52:12,708 --> 00:52:16,506
You know, conversations
I had five minutes ago.

882
00:52:16,507 --> 00:52:20,007
Well, your eldest son's a doctor,
isn't he?

883
00:52:20,107 --> 00:52:24,107
- Overwork, he says.
- Well, there you are, then.

884
00:52:25,708 --> 00:52:27,208
I feel like I'm...

885
00:52:29,027 --> 00:52:30,147
...fading.

886
00:52:31,388 --> 00:52:35,106
Like there's a darkness
on the edge of sight...

887
00:52:35,107 --> 00:52:38,348
...slowly creeping in.

888
00:52:39,428 --> 00:52:42,947
And the more... you look

889
00:52:42,987 --> 00:52:45,654
out of the corner of your eye...

890
00:52:49,067 --> 00:52:51,868
...the more it slips out of view.

891
00:52:54,507 --> 00:52:56,341
But I know it's there.

892
00:53:01,027 --> 00:53:03,506
Come on, let's get you inside.

893
00:53:03,507 --> 00:53:06,341
He had been taking money, I think.

894
00:53:07,908 --> 00:53:09,027
Who had?

895
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,467
Mr Aziz.

896
00:53:15,027 --> 00:53:16,586
Skimming, you call it now.

897
00:53:16,587 --> 00:53:18,787
Everyone thought
it was me forgetting,

898
00:53:18,788 --> 00:53:20,067
but it was him.

899
00:53:21,348 --> 00:53:23,987
Not enough to stand out, but...

900
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:28,328
...over a long period of time.

901
00:53:29,547 --> 00:53:31,131
You should've said.

902
00:53:33,547 --> 00:53:35,714
I should've paid him more.

903
00:53:41,188 --> 00:53:43,586
So, all that about
Uqbah coming up short

904
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:46,106
when they cashed up of an evening
in the restaurant

905
00:53:46,107 --> 00:53:50,146
was likely down to Mr Aziz
having his fingers in the till.

906
00:53:50,147 --> 00:53:53,227
I've run a registration check
on cars parked illegally

907
00:53:53,228 --> 00:53:55,146
- outside Tiffin Court.
- Where's this come from?

908
00:53:55,147 --> 00:53:56,387
The porter, Mr Comer.

909
00:53:56,388 --> 00:53:58,787
We got a few frequent customers.

910
00:53:58,788 --> 00:54:01,026
The most regular, a cream Mercedes.

911
00:54:01,027 --> 00:54:04,026
Saturday and Wednesdays,
roughly the same time.

912
00:54:04,027 --> 00:54:06,277
Any idea who it belongs to?

913
00:54:21,748 --> 00:54:24,626
ILSA: I really don't know
what I can do for you.

914
00:54:24,627 --> 00:54:27,587
Dr Sardar. You on a house call?

915
00:54:27,627 --> 00:54:30,827
If you forgive me, my private life
is none of your concern.

916
00:54:30,828 --> 00:54:33,466
It is if it has anything to do
with what happened to Mr Aziz

917
00:54:33,467 --> 00:54:34,986
in flat ten the other night.

918
00:54:34,987 --> 00:54:38,571
Why don't you sit down?
And you, Miss Trent.

919
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:42,187
We really don't know anything
about that. Really, we don't!

920
00:54:42,188 --> 00:54:44,626
So, were you here on Monday night,
Doctor?

921
00:54:44,627 --> 00:54:47,427
We can easily find out
if your car was.

922
00:54:47,428 --> 00:54:48,907
He was gone by 11.

923
00:54:48,908 --> 00:54:51,227
Did you see anyone loitering
about the place?

924
00:54:51,228 --> 00:54:54,348
No. Look, I have not broken the law.

925
00:54:54,388 --> 00:54:56,666
You denied ever having heard
about Tiffin Court.

926
00:54:56,667 --> 00:54:58,707
Why do that,
unless you had something to hide?

927
00:54:58,708 --> 00:55:00,146
What should I have said?

928
00:55:00,147 --> 00:55:03,146
Me and Ilsa know nothing about
what happened to poor Mr Aziz.

929
00:55:03,147 --> 00:55:05,268
OK? Just a coincidence.

930
00:55:05,308 --> 00:55:08,747
So what is it that
you didn't want us to know?

931
00:55:08,748 --> 00:55:10,027
I know Prince.

932
00:55:10,067 --> 00:55:11,946
I've seen him once or twice,

933
00:55:11,947 --> 00:55:13,546
- we play cards together.
- Where?

934
00:55:13,547 --> 00:55:16,547
Here and there.
It's nothing regular.

935
00:55:17,667 --> 00:55:20,466
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I really do have patients to see.

936
00:55:20,467 --> 00:55:23,427
There's nothing else
I can tell you right now.

937
00:55:23,428 --> 00:55:24,587
So if I may?

938
00:55:25,708 --> 00:55:26,708
All right.

939
00:55:29,547 --> 00:55:30,868
For now.

940
00:55:34,587 --> 00:55:36,754
We know where to find you.

941
00:55:44,228 --> 00:55:45,827
Where did you two meet?

942
00:55:45,828 --> 00:55:48,146
My father runs
a floating poker game.

943
00:55:48,147 --> 00:55:49,707
High stakes
for local business types.

944
00:55:49,708 --> 00:55:51,708
Who's your father?

945
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:55,267
Look, my father's got nothing
to do with this.

946
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:59,435
- I'd as soon as not say.
- We can easily find out.

947
00:55:59,788 --> 00:56:01,455
That's my dad there.

948
00:56:02,587 --> 00:56:05,787
Did Oberon Prince ever play
at your father's poker game?

949
00:56:05,788 --> 00:56:07,666
I think he was a regular, yeah.

950
00:56:07,667 --> 00:56:10,946
Not much of a card player, though,
Dad said.

951
00:56:10,947 --> 00:56:13,947
Which made him the perfect addition.

Mm, some.

957
00:56:41,708 --> 00:56:43,587
You forgive them?

958
00:56:43,627 --> 00:56:46,377
I'm not very good at forgiveness.

959
00:56:47,467 --> 00:56:51,051
Would you forgive me
if I did something bad?

960
00:56:52,268 --> 00:56:54,352
That depends what it was.

961
00:56:55,467 --> 00:56:57,626
And if there was contrition.

962
00:56:57,627 --> 00:56:59,467
Genuine contrition.

963
00:56:59,507 --> 00:57:02,507

I don't want to confess.

- Why?

the game got bumped.

The previous week,
he'd hosted the game at his place,

these are wealthy individuals.

01:03:49,828 --> 01:03:52,666
- They buy and sell people like you.
- Really?

1065
01:03:52,667 --> 01:03:55,106
I can't imagine it would do
your election campaign much good

1066
01:03:55,107 --> 01:03:56,707
if it got out that

1067
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:59,708
you enjoy play cards

we might get something

01:04:29,868 --> 01:04:32,947
- Or in love.
- Oh, please! Love?

1080
01:04:32,987 --> 01:04:35,946
You think love'll save you
from her father's thugs?

- No. No. Of course not for you (!)

You're the Great British doctor.

- Don't kid yourself.

1086
01:04:48,348 --> 01:04:51,682
They tolerate you.
Because you're useful.

1087
01:04:52,507 --> 01:04:55,106
That's what... that's what they mean
by "tolerance", right?

1088
01:04:55,107 --> 01:04:58,066
Putting up with something
they'd sooner not.

1089
01:04:58,067 --> 01:05:01,506
I don't want to be tolerated.
I want to belong.

1090
01:05:01,507 --> 01:05:03,841
- Salim...
- I'm getting out.

1091
01:05:05,388 --> 01:05:06,507
Going home.

1092
01:05:06,547 --> 01:05:07,627
Home?

1093
01:05:09,987 --> 01:05:11,107

1094
01:05:12,228 --> 01:05:13,987

01:05:14,027 --> 01:05:17,347
- I've been talking to Cousin Arik.
- Oh, Cousin Arik the Nationalist?

1096
01:05:17,348 --> 01:05:20,146
We could be part of something.
All of us.

1097
01:05:20,147 --> 01:05:22,647
Something good. Something new.

1098
01:05:25,748 --> 01:05:27,707
What does Nuha think about this?

1099
01:05:27,708 --> 01:05:31,042
She'll follow her husband,
in all things.

1100
01:05:31,388 --> 01:05:35,388
- You mean you haven't told her.
- No. He hasn't.

1101
01:05:36,788 --> 01:05:39,026
Is that's what these
late-night calls have been about?

1102
01:05:39,027 --> 01:05:41,777
We're not talking about this now.

1103
01:05:45,587 --> 01:05:47,308
I won't go back.

1104
01:05:47,348 --> 01:05:49,626
This is my home now
and I won't be driven out.

1105
01:05:49,627 --> 01:05:52,187
- Should tell him, not me.
- He's YOUR brother!

1106
01:05:52,188 --> 01:05:54,022
And he's your husband.

1107
01:06:04,987 --> 01:06:06,627
Is this all?

1108
01:06:06,667 --> 01:06:08,268
Enough, isn't it?

1109
01:06:08,308 --> 01:06:11,142
An elegant sufficiency, thank you.

1110
01:06:11,587 --> 01:06:14,546
Insofar as we appear
to have one torso,

1111
01:06:14,547 --> 01:06:17,788
together with both legs and arms,

1112
01:06:17,828 --> 01:06:21,587
but we are deficient
to the tune of one head.

1113
01:06:21,627 --> 01:06:25,427
And the mountain range
one might expect to find,

1114
01:06:25,428 --> 01:06:28,667
as the old geographers' joke has it,

1115
01:06:28,708 --> 01:06:31,625
at the end of a cockney's wristies.

1116
01:06:34,308 --> 01:06:36,142
His 'andies, Sergeant.

1117
01:06:37,828 --> 01:06:41,412
I'll know better
once I've got him laid out.

1118
01:06:41,627 --> 01:06:45,388
But in the inside compartment
in the suitcase,

1119
01:06:45,428 --> 01:06:49,228
there's a BEA airline ticket
and a passport.

1120
01:06:49,268 --> 01:06:51,685
In the name of Oberon Prince.

1121
01:06:53,748 --> 01:06:55,307
If there's nothing else, Doctor,

1122
01:06:55,308 --> 01:06:58,427
I think we'll leave you
to your jigsaw and move upwind.

1123
01:06:58,428 --> 01:07:01,595
By all means.
Shall we say two o'clock?

1124
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:06,787
How can someone do that
to another human being?

1125
01:07:06,788 --> 01:07:08,347
He's already done the worst thing.

1126
01:07:08,348 --> 01:07:12,626
That might turn our stomachs,
but the victim's long past caring.

1127
01:07:12,627 --> 01:07:15,711
So what do we imagine
has taken place?

1128
01:07:15,748 --> 01:07:18,227
Delivery man stumbles up
on something,

1129
01:07:18,228 --> 01:07:21,666
then whoever killed Oberon Prince
had to silence him? Possibly, sir.

1130
01:07:21,667 --> 01:07:23,907
I don't think
he stumbled on anything, sir.

1131
01:07:23,908 --> 01:07:26,907
- I think Mr Aziz was sent there.
- How's that?

1132
01:07:26,908 --> 01:07:29,787
Well, I suspect someone sent him
on a wild goose chase

1133
01:07:29,788 --> 01:07:30,867
on his third delivery.

1134
01:07:30,868 --> 01:07:32,827
- Mendip Gardens West?
- Yeah. - Why?

1135
01:07:32,828 --> 01:07:34,666
Well, if I was killing two people,

1136
01:07:34,667 --> 01:07:37,747
it would be easier to deal with them
separately. Don't you think?

1137
01:07:37,748 --> 01:07:40,506
So, whoever it is kills Prince,
waits for Aziz to arrive,

1138
01:07:40,507 --> 01:07:41,747
then does for him?

1139
01:07:41,748 --> 01:07:44,653
Assuming whoever it was
wanted both of them dead.

1140
01:07:44,654 --> 01:07:45,654
Two birds?

1141
01:07:55,955 --> 01:07:59,234
In the flat, I asked you
if he'd ever mentioned a Mr Aziz.

1142
01:07:59,235 --> 01:08:01,434
Now, in light
of these recent developments,

1143
01:08:01,435 --> 01:08:03,715
I'd like to know
if he knew anyone of that name.

1144
01:08:03,716 --> 01:08:05,516
No.

1145
01:08:05,556 --> 01:08:07,794
If he did,
he never mentioned anything to me.

1146
01:08:07,795 --> 01:08:12,794
Did your husband have any enemies
that you are aware of, Mrs Prince?

1147
01:08:12,795 --> 01:08:15,754
I mean, he might've given
the odd bad review

1148
01:08:15,755 --> 01:08:18,914
that some restauranteur
took exception to.

1149
01:08:18,915 --> 01:08:22,194
He could be quite difficult,
if the mood took him.

1150
01:08:22,195 --> 01:08:25,695
But nothing to warrant
something like this.

1151
01:08:26,155 --> 01:08:29,315
You're definitely sure
it's Oberon you've found?

1152
01:08:29,316 --> 01:08:30,874
You couldn't be mistaken?

1153
01:08:30,875 --> 01:08:33,074
Well, we've strong reason
to believe it is.

1154
01:08:33,075 --> 01:08:35,914
Did he have any distinguishing
features, Mrs Prince?

1155
01:08:35,915 --> 01:08:40,676
He had a... a port-wine birthmark
on his left thigh.

1156
01:08:42,755 --> 01:08:43,994
Is it that bad?

1157
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:45,636
I'm very sorry.

1158
01:08:45,676 --> 01:08:47,316
No. Thank you.

1159
01:08:48,436 --> 01:08:49,715
SHE EXHALES SHARPLY

1160
01:08:49,716 --> 01:08:52,715
Somehow I always knew
he'd come back to me in the end.

1161
01:08:52,716 --> 01:08:54,300
One way or another.

1162
01:08:55,875 --> 01:09:00,436
Not so much dismembered
as butchered and jointed.

1163
01:09:00,476 --> 01:09:05,074
With a rudimentary proficiency
and no small amount of luck.

1164
01:09:05,075 --> 01:09:08,396
- Where?
- At the flat, presumably.

1165
01:09:08,436 --> 01:09:10,874
Place would've looked like
a slaughterhouse, wouldn't it?

1166
01:09:10,875 --> 01:09:12,834
- The bathroom?
- Well, of course,

1167
01:09:12,835 --> 01:09:14,794
that's the traditional locus,

1168
01:09:14,795 --> 01:09:16,995
for obvious reasons.

1169
01:09:17,035 --> 01:09:19,834
I'd be very surprised
if Scene Of Crime

1170
01:09:19,835 --> 01:09:22,194
didn't get a result
from the U-bend of the bath.

1171
01:09:22,195 --> 01:09:25,235
- How long would it take?
- Oh, not that long.

1172
01:09:25,236 --> 01:09:29,475
Provided you've a decent knife
and a passable bone-saw.

1173
01:09:29,476 --> 01:09:30,515
MAN ENTERS
Yes?

1174
01:09:30,516 --> 01:09:34,675
Duxbury's. The undertakers.
Here about a car crash.

1175
01:09:34,676 --> 01:09:36,034
Female. Whittaker.

1176
01:09:36,035 --> 01:09:38,236
Ah, yes, drawer six.

1177
01:09:38,276 --> 01:09:40,360
I'll show you. Excuse me.

1178
01:09:52,236 --> 01:09:54,153
Hey, can I have a word?

1179
01:09:54,915 --> 01:09:57,914
The court's been in touch.
About Molly. The trial.

1180
01:09:57,915 --> 01:09:59,794
Early in the new year
they're saying?

1181
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:01,395
Yeah, that sounds about right.

1182
01:10:01,396 --> 01:10:02,754
Will they want me to testify?

1183
01:10:02,755 --> 01:10:04,875
Only as to what you know.

1184
01:10:04,915 --> 01:10:06,675
Look, I don't know what's going on,

1185
01:10:06,676 --> 01:10:09,760
but your guvnor's
following me around.

1186
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:15,635
- No, you're imagining things.
- I was at the picture house, Monday.

1187
01:10:15,636 --> 01:10:18,475
He was there.
I've seen him watching my work too.

1188
01:10:18,476 --> 01:10:22,276
I've spoken to a solicitor.
It's harassment.

1189
01:10:22,316 --> 01:10:25,034
I don't want to make any trouble...

1190
01:10:25,035 --> 01:10:27,794
...but unless he lays off,
I'll have to talk to his superiors.

1191
01:10:27,795 --> 01:10:29,212
Make a complaint.

1192
01:10:34,875 --> 01:10:37,074
MAN: Oi, love!
Why don't you go home?!

1193
01:10:37,075 --> 01:10:40,114
MAN ON RADIO: <i>Police investigating
the stabbing of an Oxford teenager

1194
01:10:40,115 --> 01:10:42,074
<i>have now launched
a murder investigation</i>

1195
01:10:42,075 --> 01:10:44,315
<i>following the death of the boy
in hospital.</i>

1196
01:10:44,316 --> 01:10:47,074
<i>He had been admitted
after a racist attack...</i>

1197
01:10:47,075 --> 01:10:48,954
- I don't believe it!
- He's done it again!

1198
01:10:48,955 --> 01:10:51,516
HE LAUGHS
Another win.

1199
01:10:51,556 --> 01:10:53,716
ROWDY CHATTER

1200
01:10:53,755 --> 01:10:57,089
Gary! What are you doing here?
Come 'ere.

1201
01:10:59,676 --> 01:11:02,874
Make yourself useful.
I'm out of smokes.

1202
01:11:02,875 --> 01:11:04,754
Nip along and get me
a packet of Guardsmen

1203
01:11:04,755 --> 01:11:06,114
and some Slim Panatellas.

1204
01:11:06,115 --> 01:11:08,315
I'll give you the money
when you get back.

1205
01:11:08,316 --> 01:11:11,316
CHATTER CONTINUES

1206
01:11:11,356 --> 01:11:12,915
He's a good lad.

1207
01:11:12,955 --> 01:11:15,716
Drinks!
CHATTER CONTINUES

1208
01:11:15,755 --> 01:11:17,436
MAN: Oh, no, no, no!

1209
01:11:21,795 --> 01:11:22,995
No, thanks.

1210
01:11:25,035 --> 01:11:30,369
So, you were made by Carl Sturgis
at the picture house on Monday.

1211
01:11:33,995 --> 01:11:36,194
I fancied an evening at the flicks.

1212
01:11:36,195 --> 01:11:38,316
X-rated smut?

1213
01:11:38,356 --> 01:11:41,435
Since when did you become
part of the plastic mac brigade?

1214
01:11:41,436 --> 01:11:42,770
What's going on?

1215
01:11:45,716 --> 01:11:47,556
I just wanna be sure.

1216
01:11:47,596 --> 01:11:49,356
Sure of what?

1217
01:11:50,436 --> 01:11:53,603
That we were right
about Molly Andrews.

1218
01:11:56,795 --> 01:12:00,074
Well... Sturgis is threatening
to make a complaint.

1219
01:12:00,075 --> 01:12:02,954
- He won't.
- What if he does? Let him.

1220
01:12:02,955 --> 01:12:05,705
I know you wanted it to be him...

1221
01:12:05,875 --> 01:12:07,675
...but you're obsessing
about the wrong man.

1222
01:12:07,676 --> 01:12:13,010
- You've gotta let it drop.
- Who do you think you're talking to?

1223
01:12:20,556 --> 01:12:21,596
DOOR SHUTS

1224
01:12:38,556 --> 01:12:39,596
No, wait!

1225
01:12:41,075 --> 01:12:43,075
HE BREATHES HEAVILY

1226
01:13:10,316 --> 01:13:11,835
Mrs Radowicz?

1227
01:13:11,875 --> 01:13:15,125
What is it now?
More lies about my Gary?

1228
01:13:23,035 --> 01:13:25,236
SHE WHIMPERS

1229
01:13:31,195 --> 01:13:33,529
SHE SOBS
He's... he's cold...

1230
01:13:34,716 --> 01:13:36,875
Why is he so cold?

1231
01:13:36,915 --> 01:13:39,995
You... you need to warm him up.

1232
01:13:40,035 --> 01:13:41,515
Fetch him a blanket!

1233
01:13:41,516 --> 01:13:44,766
Why... why don't you give him
a blanket?

1234
01:13:46,396 --> 01:13:48,516
He'll wake up.

1235
01:13:48,556 --> 01:13:50,915
Wake up! Wake up, wake up!

1236
01:13:50,955 --> 01:13:52,789
- Mrs Radowicz...
- No!

1237
01:13:54,035 --> 01:13:55,356
You did this.

1238
01:13:56,396 --> 01:13:58,813
You did this! You killed him!

1239
01:13:59,716 --> 01:14:03,115
SOBBING UNCONTROLLABLY:
Who did this?

1240
01:14:03,155 --> 01:14:06,155
Who hurt my boy?

1241
01:14:11,195 --> 01:14:12,556
I hate them!

1242
01:14:13,955 --> 01:14:18,636
I hate them all.
I hope they die screaming!

1243
01:14:18,676 --> 01:14:24,195
WPC Jarvis will see you home.
My sincere condolences.

1244
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:30,316
SHE CONTINUES SOBBING

1245
01:14:40,075 --> 01:14:41,075
Jim?

1246
01:14:41,115 --> 01:14:43,355
Thought you'd want to know
soon as...

1247
01:14:43,356 --> 01:14:45,555
There's a match come through
on the thumbprint

1248
01:14:45,556 --> 01:14:47,556
at Oberon Prince's flat.

1249
01:14:49,356 --> 01:14:51,315
So you were at the Town Hall,

1250
01:14:51,316 --> 01:14:53,074
you did your wrestling,

1251
01:14:53,075 --> 01:14:54,954
then you went out
for something to eat.

1252
01:14:54,955 --> 01:14:57,154
- Remember?
- Yeah, I remember.

1253
01:14:57,155 --> 01:15:00,994
- An Indian restaurant.
- Yeah. I said I remember.

1254
01:15:00,995 --> 01:15:03,954
<i>There was a bit of an argument
with one of the other diners.</i>

1255
01:15:03,955 --> 01:15:05,874
<i>You remember that?
<i>Vaguely.<i>

1256
01:15:05,875 --> 01:15:07,315
<i>Man called Oberon Prince?</i>

1257
01:15:07,316 --> 01:15:10,754
If you say so.
Where do you go after the restaurant?

1258
01:15:10,755 --> 01:15:13,435
Back to my digs.
Anyone vouch for you?

1259
01:15:13,436 --> 01:15:16,853
Yeah.
I were bunking in with Johnny Simba.

1260
01:15:17,236 --> 01:15:19,555
Right, that's interesting,
because according to this,

1261
01:15:19,556 --> 01:15:21,475
Mr Simba was sharing
with the Singh brothers,

1262
01:15:21,476 --> 01:15:24,034
and you had a single occupancy.

1263
01:15:24,035 --> 01:15:26,795
Right, well, it changes.

1264
01:15:26,835 --> 01:15:29,034
We stay in so many places,
it's hard to keep track.

1265
01:15:29,035 --> 01:15:31,235
But you just went straight back
to your digs.

1266
01:15:31,236 --> 01:15:32,635
Yeah, that's right.

1267
01:15:32,636 --> 01:15:35,954
Well, I wonder if you can tell us,
then, how your bloody thumb print

1268
01:15:35,955 --> 01:15:38,114
left an impression on a door frame

1269
01:15:38,115 --> 01:15:40,435
in a block of flats
called Tiffin Court.

1270
01:15:40,436 --> 01:15:42,635
A flat where we found a man dead,
murdered.

1271
01:15:42,636 --> 01:15:46,555
- I don't know anything about it.
- Well, we know that you were there.

1272
01:15:46,556 --> 01:15:49,056
So why don't you just tell us?

1273
01:15:50,195 --> 01:15:51,195
All right.

1274
01:15:51,236 --> 01:15:52,436
<i>Well...</i>

1275
01:15:53,995 --> 01:15:56,155
<i>...Oberon were drunk,</i>

1276
01:15:56,195 --> 01:15:59,529
<i>and he'd been hassling the lads,
but...</i>

1277
01:16:00,476 --> 01:16:01,835
ROWDY LAUGHTER

1278
01:16:04,795 --> 01:16:07,462
<i>...I could see it were a front.</i>

1279
01:16:14,155 --> 01:16:15,655
You got somewhere?

1280
01:16:17,596 --> 01:16:19,995
- Just like that?
- Why not?

1281
01:16:20,035 --> 01:16:23,794
I knew him from off the telly.
My mum likes his programmes.

1282
01:16:23,795 --> 01:16:26,235
He gave me his address
and I said I'd drop by later.

1283
01:16:26,236 --> 01:16:30,595
Your mates, the other wrestlers,
they know about your... preference?

1284
01:16:30,596 --> 01:16:31,995
Some.

1285
01:16:32,035 --> 01:16:34,195
Nobody cares.

1286
01:16:34,236 --> 01:16:36,435
I don't know about
the last time you looked,

1287
01:16:36,436 --> 01:16:39,555
but we get paid to roll about with
blokes wearing only our underpants.

1288
01:16:39,556 --> 01:16:41,754
Wrestling's just another part
of show business,

1289
01:16:41,755 --> 01:16:44,675
that's all I'm saying.
So long as you bring the crowds in,

1290
01:16:44,676 --> 01:16:46,874
nobody cares what you get up to
in your private life.

1291
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:48,292
So what happened?

1292
01:16:49,195 --> 01:16:53,194
Right, well, me and a couple
of the lads went to the drinker

1293
01:16:53,195 --> 01:16:54,915
for an hour or so.

1294
01:16:54,955 --> 01:16:57,622
I got to his flat about one-ish.

1295
01:16:57,676 --> 01:16:59,874
Only, I couldn't get a reply
out his flat.

1296
01:16:59,875 --> 01:17:03,475
So, I buzzed a few more
until somebody answered the door.

1297
01:17:03,476 --> 01:17:05,834
He said there'd be a key
under the mat if I were late,

1298
01:17:05,835 --> 01:17:08,502
and that I should let myself in.

1299
01:17:11,556 --> 01:17:13,676
SAWING

1300
01:17:13,716 --> 01:17:15,914
<i>There was somebody there.
I could hear 'em.</i>

1301
01:17:15,915 --> 01:17:17,415
SAWING INTENSIFIES

1302
01:17:17,436 --> 01:17:21,914
<i>Sounded like... I don't know...
..somebody sawing wood.</i>

1303
01:17:21,915 --> 01:17:23,754
But you didn't see anyone?

1304
01:17:23,755 --> 01:17:27,034
<i>Apart from the dead guy
on the floor, no.</i>

1305
01:17:27,035 --> 01:17:31,285
<i>I wasn't gonna hang around
and make introductions.</i>

1306
01:17:32,716 --> 01:17:35,034
- So what happened to the knife?
- I got rid of it.

1307
01:17:35,035 --> 01:17:37,869
- Where?
- I stuck it down a drain.

1308
01:17:47,195 --> 01:17:48,675
It's where Sloan said it was.

1309
01:17:48,676 --> 01:17:50,194
It's the killer's, then.

1310
01:17:50,195 --> 01:17:52,355
That was the telephone exchange.

1311
01:17:52,356 --> 01:17:54,555
They've run down numbers
that called the restaurant.

1312
01:17:54,556 --> 01:17:57,556
And two came from
the same telephone.

1313
01:18:08,276 --> 01:18:10,754
Order two takeaways
from The Jolly Rajah...

1314
01:18:10,755 --> 01:18:13,505
only 20 yards from the phone box?

1315
01:18:14,995 --> 01:18:16,162
Why two calls?

1316
01:18:17,155 --> 01:18:20,034
Well, the first is to the bogus
address at Mendip Gardens West.

1317
01:18:20,035 --> 01:18:22,275
The second to Oberon Prince's flat
at Tiffin Court.

1318
01:18:22,276 --> 01:18:25,635
Which means whoever made the calls
needed to buy themselves time.

1319
01:18:25,636 --> 01:18:27,874
Yeah, they needed to keep
Mr Aziz distracted

1320
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:30,074
while they got
to Tiffin Court first.

1321
01:18:30,075 --> 01:18:31,515
We'll get forensics out.

1322
01:18:31,516 --> 01:18:33,515
Needle in a haystack
after four days,

1323
01:18:33,516 --> 01:18:34,675
but we might get lucky.

1324
01:18:34,676 --> 01:18:37,435
Having a take-away
delivered to Tiffin Court, but...

1325
01:18:37,436 --> 01:18:39,235
it's not much of a plan
given that Prince

1326
01:18:39,236 --> 01:18:41,435
- had already dined at the restaurant.
- You're right,

1327
01:18:41,436 --> 01:18:43,794
but our killer didn't know
he HAD dined at the restaurant.

1328
01:18:43,795 --> 01:18:45,235
- How come?
- Because the chief stoker

1329
01:18:45,236 --> 01:18:47,653
never leaves the engine room.

1330
01:18:52,835 --> 01:18:55,419
HE SPEAKS IN AN INDIAN LANGUAGE

1331
01:18:57,596 --> 01:18:58,955
UQBAH: Rafiq.

1332
01:19:04,835 --> 01:19:07,515
Evening, Mr Sardar.
Could you come with us, please?

1333
01:19:07,516 --> 01:19:09,754
I can't leave the restaurant
in the middle of service.

1334
01:19:09,755 --> 01:19:12,755
I'm afraid you're gonna have to,
sir.

1335
01:19:14,636 --> 01:19:16,795
HE SPEAKS,
A MAN REPLIES

1336
01:19:22,955 --> 01:19:26,235
You were the only person
on the staff who didn't realise

1337
01:19:26,236 --> 01:19:29,114
that Mr Prince had already been
in the restaurant that evening.

1338
01:19:29,115 --> 01:19:31,794
You ordered Mr Aziz
to deliver a take-away to a man

1339
01:19:31,795 --> 01:19:33,114
who'd already eaten with you.

1340
01:19:33,115 --> 01:19:37,435
We've also recovered
the knife you killed Prince with.

1341
01:19:37,436 --> 01:19:40,020
How much were you into him for?

1342
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:44,795
£13,000.

1343
01:19:47,115 --> 01:19:49,032
I tried to keep away...

1344
01:19:50,476 --> 01:19:53,476
...but the cards get into your skin.

1345
01:19:54,955 --> 01:19:59,194
- I broke the golden rule...
- Don't chase your losses.

1346
01:19:59,195 --> 01:20:02,112
Next time, the hand will be better.

1347
01:20:02,436 --> 01:20:05,235
You always think
your luck will turn.

1348
01:20:05,236 --> 01:20:08,034
And there's nobody in your family
that could've loaned that to you?

1349
01:20:08,035 --> 01:20:09,236
Loaned?

1350
01:20:10,516 --> 01:20:12,433
That was mine by right.

1351
01:20:13,556 --> 01:20:16,754
My half of the business.
What should have been my half.

1352
01:20:16,755 --> 01:20:17,755
The profits.

1353
01:20:18,795 --> 01:20:22,295
If my brother had remembered
our agreement.

1354
01:20:23,556 --> 01:20:27,794
All I wanted was my fair share,
50-50, that is what we agreed.

1355
01:20:27,795 --> 01:20:30,962
But your brother went back
on his word.

1356
01:20:31,316 --> 01:20:35,355
He said, "Don't worry yourself
with overheads and loans

1357
01:20:35,356 --> 01:20:38,915
"and credit and debit and...

1358
01:20:38,955 --> 01:20:43,194
"Just concentrate on the cooking,
leave the worrying to me."

1359
01:20:43,195 --> 01:20:45,195
You felt cheated?

1360
01:20:45,236 --> 01:20:46,716
I WAS cheated.

1361
01:20:49,075 --> 01:20:52,742
He said he couldn't remember
our arrangement.

1362
01:20:54,915 --> 01:20:58,034
He said, "Don't worry,
you will be sorted out,

1363
01:20:58,035 --> 01:20:59,355
"you will be looked after."

1364
01:20:59,356 --> 01:21:00,476
My nephews?

1365
01:21:01,596 --> 01:21:03,846
Taking care of their uncle?

1366
01:21:04,516 --> 01:21:07,476
Like I am some beggar man?

1367
01:21:07,516 --> 01:21:09,475
So you began stealing
from the restaurant

1368
01:21:09,476 --> 01:21:11,675
in order to pay your debt
to Oberon Prince.

1369
01:21:11,676 --> 01:21:13,954
It wasn't that your brother
was losing his faculties

1370
01:21:13,955 --> 01:21:17,114
and getting the sums wrong,
you were stealing from him.

1371
01:21:17,115 --> 01:21:19,114
What was it, Mr Aziz discovered you?

1372
01:21:19,115 --> 01:21:20,516
He saw me.

1373
01:21:20,556 --> 01:21:22,306
Did he blackmail you?

1374
01:21:23,436 --> 01:21:24,995
No.

1375
01:21:27,276 --> 01:21:31,114
He gave me a chance to come clean
and tell Uqbah, or he would.

1376
01:21:31,115 --> 01:21:35,596
So you came up with a plan
to solve all your problems.

1377
01:21:35,636 --> 01:21:37,755
Two birds with one stone.

1378
01:21:39,195 --> 01:21:42,475
<i>You kill Oberon Prince,
which eradicates your debt,</i>

1379
01:21:42,476 --> 01:21:44,635
<i>and you frame him for killing Aziz.</i>

1380
01:21:44,636 --> 01:21:49,475
<i>So your brother never discovers
that you were stealing from him.</i>

1381
01:21:49,476 --> 01:21:53,235
You think it's going to be easy
to do this... to someone.

1382
01:21:53,236 --> 01:21:55,236
It is easy in your head.

1383
01:21:55,915 --> 01:21:58,582
<i>But with another human being...</i>

1384
01:22:00,276 --> 01:22:01,915
<i>...it is not easy.</i>

1385
01:22:02,955 --> 01:22:03,955
<i>No.</i>

1386
01:22:07,236 --> 01:22:12,676
One minute, they are
a living, breathing creature...

1387
01:22:12,716 --> 01:22:16,915
and... and then
they're just meat and bones.

1388
01:22:18,755 --> 01:22:21,172
It's a bad thing I have done.

1389
01:22:22,035 --> 01:22:23,716
A wicked thing.

1390
01:22:25,075 --> 01:22:28,075
And I feel ashamed for it.

1391
01:22:28,115 --> 01:22:31,865
It is one thing to know yourself
to be weak...

1392
01:22:32,795 --> 01:22:35,915
I am a gambler. I am a thief.

1393
01:22:37,476 --> 01:22:41,395
...but it is another thing
when the people you love...

1394
01:22:41,396 --> 01:22:42,896
know what you are.

1395
01:22:44,035 --> 01:22:46,155
I gave in to temptation.

1396
01:22:48,795 --> 01:22:52,379
How could I ever look them
in the eye again?

1397
01:22:55,396 --> 01:22:56,755
I had no choice.

1398
01:23:00,396 --> 01:23:01,730
What could I do?

1399
01:23:12,195 --> 01:23:13,195
Look...

1400
01:23:14,356 --> 01:23:18,034
- What you said earlier...
- I was speaking out of turn.

1401
01:23:18,035 --> 01:23:19,436
No, no.

1402
01:23:19,476 --> 01:23:21,060
Maybe you're right.

1403
01:23:22,396 --> 01:23:25,476
All this with Carl Sturgis.

1404
01:23:27,316 --> 01:23:29,983
You just get obsessed sometimes.

1405
01:23:31,835 --> 01:23:33,085
I'll let it go.

1406
01:23:41,436 --> 01:23:42,835
All well, is it?

1407
01:23:43,995 --> 01:23:44,995
With you?

1408
01:23:48,115 --> 01:23:49,115
Always.

1409
01:23:51,676 --> 01:23:53,093
See you tomorrow.

1410
01:23:59,476 --> 01:24:02,914
MAN OVER SPEAKER: <i>For a better
Oxford and a better Britain...

1411
01:24:02,915 --> 01:24:06,236
<i>vote Archibald-Lake.
Vote Conservative.</i>

1412
01:24:06,276 --> 01:24:10,834
<i>A vote for the Conservative Party
is a vote for a better tomorrow.</i>

1413
01:24:10,835 --> 01:24:12,754
Whatever the result tonight,

1414
01:24:12,755 --> 01:24:17,715
you can see what happens
when you mix their culture and ours.

1415
01:24:17,716 --> 01:24:22,516
Not 24 hours since,
we lost a foot soldier.

1416
01:24:23,596 --> 01:24:25,556
A good patriate.

1417
01:24:25,596 --> 01:24:29,346
- Young Gary Rogers.
- MRS RADOWICZ: Radowicz!

1418
01:24:31,995 --> 01:24:35,035
Gerwazy Radowicz.

1419
01:24:39,276 --> 01:24:40,526
Mrs Radowicz...

1420
01:24:46,556 --> 01:24:48,476
He was my boy.

1421
01:24:53,276 --> 01:24:56,995
You killed him.
Just as much as they did.

1422
01:24:58,596 --> 01:25:01,180
Filling his head with all this.

1423
01:25:04,316 --> 01:25:05,476
We all did.

1424
01:25:23,115 --> 01:25:25,955
My only brother stealing from me.

1425
01:25:28,035 --> 01:25:32,436
And killing... poor Mr Aziz.

1426
01:25:33,676 --> 01:25:37,426
- If only I had...
- It'll be all right, Baba.

1427
01:25:37,556 --> 01:25:39,140
It'll be all right.

1428
01:25:45,035 --> 01:25:49,595
I'll make sure he's looked after.
He can come and live with us.

1429
01:25:49,596 --> 01:25:50,676
Us?

1430
01:25:51,795 --> 01:25:55,236
Me and Ilsa. We're getting married.

1431
01:25:56,835 --> 01:26:00,636
So, when you leave...
We're staying.

1432
01:26:02,955 --> 01:26:07,396
All this anger, all the violence,
and all this hatred?

1433
01:26:08,556 --> 01:26:10,954
In the end, it defeats only itself.

1434
01:26:10,955 --> 01:26:14,289
And burns itself out
like a stubble fire.

1435
01:26:15,035 --> 01:26:17,515
We'll see Baba's looked after
between the both of us,

1436
01:26:17,516 --> 01:26:20,034
and Salim will take over
the restaurant.

1437
01:26:20,035 --> 01:26:21,155
With my help.

1438
01:26:22,195 --> 01:26:25,612
A good husband always listens
to his wife.

1439
01:26:25,875 --> 01:26:27,459
As you'll find out.

1440
01:26:32,075 --> 01:26:34,955
OPERA MUSIC PLAYS SOFTLY

1441
01:26:41,556 --> 01:26:43,236
DOORBELL RINGS

1442
01:27:41,316 --> 01:27:45,596
SOMEONE WHISTLING,
CLATTERING

1443
01:27:51,316 --> 01:27:52,914
MAN ON RADIO: <i>Ten o'clock.

1444

1446
01:27:56,636 --> 01:28:02,303

00:12:42,884 --> 00:12:45,004
<font color="cyan">Such a ruse as you're suggesting</font>

149
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:47,604
<font color="cyan">supposes a far greater</font>
<font color="cyan">presence of mind</font>

150
00:12:47,644 --> 00:12:50,524
<font color="cyan">than one usually finds</font>
<font color="cyan">in cases like these.</font>

151
00:12:50,565 --> 00:12:53,284
It's him. I know it is.
I can feel it in my corns.

152
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:54,445
I can crack him.

153
00:12:54,484 --> 00:12:55,725
<font color="cyan">I'm sure.</font>

154
00:12:55,764 --> 00:12:57,925
<font color="cyan">Well, keep me abreast</font>
<font color="cyan">of any developments.</font>

155
00:12:57,965 --> 00:12:59,124
Of course.

156
00:12:59,165 --> 00:13:00,925
<font color="cyan">Very well. Carry on.</font>

157
00:13:00,965 --> 00:13:02,404
Sir.

158
00:13:07,325 --> 00:13:09,764
If I might ask, sir.

159
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:12,764
How's Mrs Bright bearing up?

160
00:13:13,845 --> 00:13:15,644
<font color="cyan">As well as can be expected.</font>

161
00:13:48,004 --> 00:13:50,685
You're back, then?
How was, erm...?

162
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:52,884
<font color="yellow">Oh, you know.</font>

163
00:13:52,925 --> 00:13:54,685
<font color="yellow">So, what've I missed?</font>

164
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,140
GIRLS GIGGLE

165
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:46,099
I'm given to understand
that the ACC's daughter

166
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,660
was amongst a group of young women

167
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,099
making their way back
from Lady Matilda's boathouse,

168
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,379
along the towpath,

169
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,379
when a man exposed himself to them.

170
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,780
Obviously, with the killer
of the barmaid...

171
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,940
<font color="yellow">Molly Andrews, sir.</font>

172
00:14:59,979 --> 00:15:01,820
Yes, thank you, Sergeant.

173
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,060
..the young woman at New Year,
still at large,

174
00:15:04,099 --> 00:15:06,820
the ACC is keen to know
what progress is being made.

175
00:15:06,859 --> 00:15:08,339
<font color="yellow">Bit of a sticker, sir.</font>

176
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:11,540
<font color="yellow">But I'm still of the strong opinion</font>
<font color="yellow">that the boyfriend's responsible.</font>

177
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:12,579
<font color="yellow">Carl Sturgis.</font>

178
00:15:12,619 --> 00:15:14,900
Her purse was taken, wasn't it?

179
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,900
Doesn't that suggest a robbery?

180
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,499
One wouldn't expect that
in a domestic dispute.

181
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,300
<font color="cyan">The boyfriend always seemed</font>
<font color="cyan">a little pedestrian to my mind.</font>

182
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,859
<font color="cyan">Plus, he's alibied, isn't he?</font>

183
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,579
What's this?

184
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:29,619
<font color="cyan">Well, a cab driver said he picked</font>
<font color="cyan">him up outside The Grapes, smashed,</font>

185
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,420
<font color="cyan">and dropped him</font>
<font color="cyan">at an address in Cowley.</font>

186
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:34,060
<font color="cyan">Had to pour him through</font>
<font color="cyan">the letter box, supposedly.</font>

187
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,379
<font color="yellow">Well, he could've come back.</font>

188
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,259
<font color="yellow">That's if the cabby</font>
<font color="yellow">had the right man.</font>

189
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,140
<font color="cyan">Sturgis did say that</font>
<font color="cyan">he got a cab though, didn't he?</font>

190
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,660
<font color="yellow">One young drunk on New Year's Eve</font>

191
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,859
<font color="yellow">looks much like another,</font>
<font color="yellow">I'd have thought.</font>

192
00:15:45,739 --> 00:15:47,859
<font color="cyan">Ye... I...</font>

193
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,940
<font color="cyan">I was on leave the initial week</font>
<font color="cyan">of the investigation,</font>

194
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:53,619
<font color="cyan">so I may not have the full picture.</font>

195
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,420
Indeed.

196
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:59,660
Well, perhaps you might
take another look.

197
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,140
What do you say, Thursday?

198
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,780
Fresh pair of eyes.

199
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,020
<font color="yellow">If you think so, sir.</font>

200
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,219
Yes, well,
I can't see the harm in it.

201
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,300
Done yourself an injury, Sergeant?

202
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:17,219
<font color="#008000">Rat, sir. Big bugger.</font>

203
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:18,660
<font color="#008000">Been hanging about the coal shed.</font>

204
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,499
<font color="#008000">Gave me a nip when I went up the</font>
<font color="#008000">yard last night to fill the scuttle.</font>

205
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,979
But you've seen someone about it?

206
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,180
<font color="#008000">Yes, sir. Tetanus first thing.</font>
<font color="#008000">From the house man.</font>

207
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:35,660
<font color="cyan">Where is he, the boyfriend?</font>

208
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,140
<font color="#008000">Carl Sturgis?</font>
<font color="cyan">Mm-hm.</font>

209
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,060
<font color="#008000">Drives for Duxbury's at Cowley.</font>

<font color="#008000">Undertakers.</font>
<font color="#008000">I'll dig out the address.</font>

211
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,459
<font color="yellow">Pedestrian? You never said.</font>

212
00:16:51,499 --> 00:16:52,739
<font color="cyan">Well, I came to it late.</font>

213
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,660
<font color="cyan">I thought perhaps you knew</font>
<font color="cyan">something I didn't.</font>

214
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,540
<font color="yellow">Not everything's a crossword puzzle.</font>

215
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:59,060
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, how everything looks</font>
<font color="yellow">is how it is.</font>

216
00:16:59,099 --> 00:17:01,300
<font color="yellow">The boyfriend, the husband,</font>
<font color="yellow">the father, the brother.</font>

217
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:04,219
<font color="cyan">Right, so, if you thought he did it,</font>

218
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:05,739
<font color="cyan">why didn't you charge him?</font>

219
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:07,940
<font color="yellow">We couldn't put him at the scene!</font>

220
00:17:07,979 --> 00:17:12,019
<font color="yellow">We turned his place inside out.</font>
<font color="yellow">Not a shred. No purse. No nothing.</font>

221
00:17:13,219 --> 00:17:15,019
<font color="cyan">And if he didn't do it?</font>

222
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:17,219
<font color="yellow">Then I'm sure</font>
<font color="yellow">you'll get to the bottom of it.</font>

223
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,620
<font color="yellow">Did Molly ever mention</font>
<font color="yellow">a college type?</font>

224
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,059
<font color="yellow">Boyfriend, perhaps?</font>

225
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,219
Not lately.

226
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,420
She did like the college-y ones.

227
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:35,580
Said they treated her more nice.

228
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:40,100
Thought I was done with kiddies.

229
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,700
My Rose.

230
00:17:41,739 --> 00:17:43,499
Molly.

231
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:46,739
Now Lucy.
Third time lucky.

232
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:48,380
<font color="cyan">What about the child's father?</font>

233
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,539

<font color="cyan">you weren't concerned?</font>

236
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,979
I took it she was seeing her fella.

237
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:02,299
<font color="cyan">Carl Sturgis?</font>

238
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,979
She weren't a bad girl.

239
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,340
Just lonely.

240
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,580
I think it's not having
a father herself.

241
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:15,059
She was always
looking for something.

242
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,100
<font color="cyan">What did you make to him? Carl.</font>

243
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,420
Couldn't say.

244
00:18:22,459 --> 00:18:24,059
She never brung any of 'em home.

00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,499
<font color="#008000">Well, not in so many words, but</font>
<font color="#008000">I think we've got an understanding.</font>

286
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,459
<font color="#008000">Look at this.</font>

287
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,219
<font color="#008000">Well, well.</font>

288
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:38,180
<font color="yellow">Dr Naomi Benford, 28,</font>
<font color="yellow">currently, Junior Research Fellow</font>

289
00:20:38,219 --> 00:20:40,100
<font color="yellow">at The Department</font>
<font color="yellow">of Latent Potential.</font>

290
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,180
<font color="yellow">As you tilt the horizontal plane,</font>
<font color="yellow">the section is an ellipse,</font>

291
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:47,259
<font color="yellow">but there will come a point where</font>
<font color="yellow">the plane is parallel to the line.</font>

292
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:51,499
<font color="yellow">Now, let's see</font>
<font color="yellow">how that applies to...</font>

293
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:55,459
<font color="cyan">Strong... to break someone's neck?</font>

294
00:20:56,499 --> 00:20:58,019
<font color="#008000">Not necessarily.</font>

295
00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:00,299
<font color="#008000">The right angle, a sudden twist.</font>

296
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:03,739
<font color="#008000">At least it would</font>
<font color="#008000">have been relatively quick.</font>

297
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,259
<font color="cyan">Nothing out of the ordinary, then?</font>

298
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:10,059
<font color="#008000">All too ordinary, I'm afraid.</font>

299
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,580
<font color="#008000">The female of the species</font>
<font color="#008000">might hold good for Kipling,</font>

300
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,819
<font color="#008000">but he never walked a crooked mile</font>
<font color="#008000">in these brogues.</font>

301
00:21:19,499 --> 00:21:24,779
<font color="#008000">There's nothing here that</font>
<font color="#008000">wasn't in my report at the time.</font>

302
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:26,420
<font color="cyan">Well, I was on leave at the time.</font>

303
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:28,940
<font color="cyan">Mr Bright's asked me</font>
<font color="cyan">to take a second look.</font>

304
00:21:28,979 --> 00:21:30,420
<font color="cyan">It's just fresh horses.</font>

305
00:21:30,459 --> 00:21:32,860
<font color="cyan">What do you make</font>
<font color="cyan">to the mark on her neck?</font>

306
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,700
<font color="#008000">Ligature?</font>

307
00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:36,340
<font color="#008000">Garrotte, possibly?</font>

308
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,259
<font color="cyan">But I thought you said her neck was</font>
<font color="cyan">broken, that she wasn't asphyxiated.</font>

309
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:45,019
<font color="#008000">Well, perhaps, he started out</font>
<font color="#008000">trying to choke her and...</font>

310
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:46,459
<font color="#008000">changed his mind.</font>

311
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:50,380
<font color="cyan">You don't sound terribly convinced.</font>

312
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,380
<font color="#008000">I'm not.</font>

313
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,140
<font color="#008000">Answers on a postcard</font>
<font color="#008000">to the usual address.</font>

314
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,259
I think she's got a bloody nerve.
She's not been here five minutes.

315
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:00,660
<font color="yellow">Oh, give it a rest, will you?</font>

316
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,819
Oh, speak of the little succubus.

317
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,700
Here she is, look.

318
00:22:04,739 --> 00:22:06,420
You are a dark horse,
aren't you, love?

319
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:08,580
<font color="cyan">Something you want, Ferman?</font>

320
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,059
I just wondered
where you got the idea

321
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,299
you would put yourself forward
for the television.

322
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,100
<font color="cyan">I wasn't aware</font>
<font color="cyan">I had to ask your permission (?)</font>

323
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,019
<font color="cyan">There was an advert</font>
<font color="cyan">in the college newsletter.</font>

324
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:19,940
Oh, I know there was. We all saw it.

325
00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:22,140
There's such a thing
as seniority, you know.

326
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,580
You've heard the phrase,
best man for the job, have you?

327
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,779
SHE SCOFFS
<font color="cyan">Don't talk rot.</font>

328
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:27,380
You're a junior research fellow.

329
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,620
Tea and filing,
that's what you're here for

330
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,900
and don't you forget it.

331
00:22:31,979 --> 00:22:34,100
<font color="#008000">Naomi, if you have a moment.</font>

KNOCK AT DOOR

333
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,219
And a certain woman,

334
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:08,019
which had an issue of blood
12 years

335
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:12,100
And had suffered many
things of many physicians

336
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,779
and spent all that she had,
and was nothing bettered,

337
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:18,739
but rather grew worse.

338
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:21,819
When she had heard of Jesus

339
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,779
she came into the press behind,

340
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:27,539
and touched his garment.

341
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,819
And he said unto her,

342
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:37,739
Daughter, thy faith
hath made thee whole.

343
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:43,299
Go in peace,
and be whole of thy plague.

346
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,660
<font color="yellow">Stronger every day.</font>

347
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,819
<font color="cyan">Well, that's marvellous.</font>

348
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:22,700
<font color="yellow">You do have faith, don't you, Puli?</font>

349
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:25,940
<font color="cyan">Of course, my dear.</font>

350
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,259
<font color="cyan">Of course.</font>

BELLS CHIME

361
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,299
Morning, Win.

<font color="yellow">Morning, Reet. Bridget.</font>

363
00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:15,660
<font color="cyan">Shoo. Shoo!</font>

364
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,819
<font color="#008000">It's nine o'clock with Mr Bright.</font>

365
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,700
<font color="#008000">Sharp, he said.</font>

366
00:27:22,739 --> 00:27:25,700
Traditionally, the condemned man
gets a hearty breakfast.

367
00:27:25,739 --> 00:27:27,380
<font color="#008000">Oh, come on, it's not like that.</font>

368
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,819
Isn't it? My investigation
passed scrutiny, then?

369
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:34,019
<font color="#008000">Well. Early days.</font>

370
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:35,499
That right?

371
00:27:37,499 --> 00:27:39,180
Butter's cold.

372
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,340
<font color="yellow">Square.</font>

373
00:27:54,499 --> 00:27:56,019
<font color="yellow">Wavy lines.</font>

374
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,860
<font color="cyan">So, going through</font>
<font color="cyan">the original statements,</font>

375
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,219
<font color="cyan">there's a dog-walker came forward,</font>
<font color="cyan">day after the body was discovered,</font>

376
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:08,259
<font color="cyan">said he'd heard someone</font>
<font color="cyan">whistling on the towpath. </font><font color="#008000">Whistling?</font>

377
00:28:08,299 --> 00:28:09,979
<font color="cyan">Hm. A melody that he couldn't place.</font>

378
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:12,180
<font color="cyan">But it doesn't seem</font>
<font color="cyan">to have been followed up.</font>

379
00:28:12,219 --> 00:28:13,819
I followed it up.

380
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,420
I spoke to him.
Mr Scrimm. He didn't see anyone.

381
00:28:16,459 --> 00:28:18,660
There's nothing to say
it was connected, sir.

382
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,739
<font color="#008000">What about traffic on the canal?</font>

383
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:22,900
Very little of it, sir.

384
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,100
The odd bit of boating for pleasure,
but not at that time of year.

385
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,259
<font color="cyan">I'm sorry, sir,</font>
<font color="cyan">but that's not strictly true.</font>

386
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:35,180
<font color="cyan">Erm, I have a report</font>
<font color="cyan">of a narrow boat, The Rosie Jugg,</font>

387
00:28:35,219 --> 00:28:37,660
<font color="cyan">logged passing through</font>
<font color="cyan">Braunston Junction</font>

388
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,860
<font color="cyan">in the early hours</font>
<font color="cyan">of New Year's Day.</font>

389
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,019
<font color="cyan">Skipper was an Abraham Petrovski.</font>

390
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:46,019
<font color="cyan">He has history of petty theft</font>
<font color="cyan">and drunken disorderliness.</font>

391
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:49,299
<font color="cyan">Though, where he is now</font>
<font color="cyan">is anybody's guess.</font>

392
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:25,544
Any other business?

393
00:29:25,584 --> 00:29:26,824
Good.

394
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,625
<font color="yellow">Erm, F-23?</font>
<font color="yellow">I just wondered,</font>

395
00:29:28,665 --> 00:29:29,984
<font color="yellow">now you've had a little time.</font>

396
00:29:30,024 --> 00:29:33,984
Mm. Well, I don't think we're
taking that any further, are we?

397
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:36,504
<font color="yellow">F-23 scores very highly.</font>

398
00:29:36,544 --> 00:29:38,465
<font color="cyan">Some little nobody?</font>

399
00:29:38,504 --> 00:29:40,064
<font color="yellow">What's that got</font>
<font color="yellow">to do with anything?</font>

400
00:29:40,105 --> 00:29:42,504
<font color="yellow">She might not know which knife</font>
<font color="yellow">and fork to use at high table,</font>

401
00:29:42,544 --> 00:29:43,905
<font color="yellow">but her scores are off the chart.</font>

402
00:29:43,945 --> 00:29:46,105
<font color="yellow">Jeremy, you'll back me up.</font>

403
00:29:46,145 --> 00:29:47,264
<font color="#008000">I don't know, Nay.</font>

404
00:29:47,304 --> 00:29:50,465
<font color="cyan">There's nothing there that couldn't</font>
<font color="cyan">have come out of the papers?</font>

405
00:29:50,504 --> 00:29:53,225
<font color="yellow">Well, I don't know. Isn't that</font>
<font color="yellow">the point? Don't we have a duty?</font>

406
00:29:53,264 --> 00:29:55,264
To science? Certainly.

407
00:29:55,304 --> 00:29:58,344
<font color="yellow">Yeah, but science doesn't exist in</font>
<font color="yellow">a vacuum. We're part of this town.</font>

408
00:29:59,705 --> 00:30:01,264
There's no need for hysterics.

409
00:30:01,304 --> 00:30:05,504
<font color="yellow">I'm not hysterical.</font>
<font color="yellow">I'm worried, genuinely worried.</font>

410
00:30:05,544 --> 00:30:08,064
<font color="yellow">You said you'd consider this</font>
<font color="yellow">seriously, but it's been months.</font>

411
00:30:08,105 --> 00:30:09,544
It really isn't any of our concern.

412
00:30:09,584 --> 00:30:11,024
<font color="yellow">But it will be if something happens</font>

413
00:30:11,064 --> 00:30:12,905
<font color="yellow">and it gets out</font>
<font color="yellow">we've withheld information.</font>

414
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:14,945
But it won't.
<font color="yellow">Won't what?</font>

415
00:30:14,984 --> 00:30:17,145
<font color="yellow">Won't happen or won't get out?</font>
Either.

416
00:30:17,185 --> 00:30:19,304
Now, really, I am very busy.

417
00:30:43,584 --> 00:30:45,824
It don't sit right with me,
you do know that, don't you?

418
00:30:47,905 --> 00:30:49,665

Oh, I shall be oppressing

I was at Lonsdale.

553
00:38:54,424 --> 00:38:57,784
<font color="cyan">Lonsdale, yes! Please,</font>
<font color="cyan">allow me to stand you a drink?</font>

554
00:38:57,824 --> 00:38:59,025
Oh no. I'm fine, thank you.

555
00:38:59,065 --> 00:39:00,505
<font color="cyan">No, look, I insist.</font>

556
00:39:00,545 --> 00:39:03,384
<font color="cyan">I have some small connection</font>
<font color="cyan">to this afternoon's entertainment,</font>

557
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,065
<font color="cyan">which, in a manner of speaking,</font>
<font color="cyan">makes you my guest.</font>

558
00:39:28,264 --> 00:39:30,424
Frivolous.
It is NOT scientific work!

559
00:39:30,464 --> 00:39:31,625
It's NOT important.

560
00:39:31,665 --> 00:39:34,185
This... this is...
demeans us all, I'm sorry.

561
00:39:34,225 --> 00:39:36,744
<font color="yellow">Donald, I think you're</font>
<font color="yellow">being unreasonable.</font>

562
00:39:36,784 --> 00:39:38,424
<font color="cyan">Oh, sorry.</font>

563
00:39:38,464 --> 00:39:40,424
<font color="cyan">It'll keep. If you're in</font>
<font color="cyan">the middle of something.</font>

564
00:39:40,464 --> 00:39:41,864
<font color="cyan">I can...</font>
<font color="yellow">No, we're not.</font>

565
00:39:41,904 --> 00:39:43,464
<font color="yellow">Donald.</font>

566
00:39:46,264 --> 00:39:47,744
Do you know about this?

567
00:39:48,864 --> 00:39:51,304
<font color="cyan">Oh, I might've heard</font>
<font color="cyan">something about it.</font>

568
00:39:51,344 --> 00:39:52,665
Well, you might have told me.

569
00:39:52,705 --> 00:39:54,464
You know,
this is a serious department.

570
00:39:54,505 --> 00:39:56,625
We are engaged upon serious work.

571
00:39:56,665 --> 00:39:59,025
The Bursar's already making
noises about funding.

572
00:39:59,065 --> 00:40:01,705
Something like this
could turn us into a laughing stock.

573
00:40:04,824 --> 00:40:06,344
APPLAUSE

574
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,185
You enjoyed the concert?

575
00:40:13,225 --> 00:40:15,065
<font color="yellow">Very much.</font>

576
00:40:15,105 --> 00:40:18,065
Music is my life. My grand passion.

577
00:40:18,105 --> 00:40:20,784
Second only to the dogged pursuit
of beautiful women.

578
00:40:20,824 --> 00:40:22,304
MORSE LAUGHS
You would say this,

579
00:40:22,344 --> 00:40:24,505
"dogged pursuit," in English?
<font color="yellow">Yes, we would.</font>

580
00:40:24,545 --> 00:40:27,744
Well, there we are,
such are the articles of my faith.

581
00:40:27,784 --> 00:40:29,665
The only ones I acknowledge,
in any event.

582
00:40:29,705 --> 00:40:30,784
<font color="yellow">There are much worse.</font>

583
00:40:30,824 --> 00:40:32,065
Ah, none better.
CHUCKLES

584
00:40:32,105 --> 00:40:33,585
And now I am hungry.

585
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:34,904
Shall we have supper?

586
00:40:34,944 --> 00:40:37,105
<font color="yellow">Oh, well...</font>
I shall brook no refusal.

587
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:38,904
There's a little place I know.

588
00:40:38,944 --> 00:40:40,065
You'll love it.

589
00:40:47,105 --> 00:40:48,344
<font color="cyan">Cross.</font>

<font color="yellow">there's nothing I've missed.</font>

604
00:41:33,545 --> 00:41:35,384
Morse?

605
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:39,264
Well, I'm not sure what
I think about that, I'm sure.

606
00:41:39,304 --> 00:41:41,744
<font color="yellow">Don't mean anything.</font>

607
00:41:41,784 --> 00:41:44,025
<font color="yellow">Standard practice, that's all.</font>

FAINT CHIRPS

<font color="yellow">Ah...</font>

610
00:41:51,065 --> 00:41:54,185
<font color="yellow">I bought a couple of canaries</font>
<font color="yellow">down the market.</font>

611
00:41:54,225 --> 00:41:57,464
<font color="yellow">A pair, a cock and hen.</font>
<font color="yellow">We might get some chicks.</font>

612
00:41:57,505 --> 00:41:58,985
Might we?

613

<font color="yellow">I used to keep birds</font>

<font color="yellow">Well, look after them</font>

<font color="yellow">I thought it might be...</font>

<font color="yellow">Something. An interest.</font>

617

<font color="yellow">And if it is,</font>
<font color="yellow">I'll... I'll see to it.</font>

620
00:42:15,545 --> 00:42:17,225
<font color="yellow">It's two birds.</font>

621
00:42:17,264 --> 00:42:18,625
<font color="yellow">They're not gonna bother you.</font>

622
00:42:18,665 --> 00:42:20,185
Well, where're we going to put them?

623
00:42:20,225 --> 00:42:22,384
<font color="yellow">Where we going to keep them?</font>
<font color="yellow">Up my arse, Winifred.</font>

624
00:42:22,424 --> 00:42:24,065
<font color="yellow">That's where gonna keep them.</font>
<font color="yellow">Up my arse.</font>

<font color="yellow">Like David Nixon.</font>

00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:28,264
I'm just asking.

627
00:42:28,304 --> 00:42:29,904
No need for language.

628
00:42:29,944 --> 00:42:33,025
<font color="yellow">In a cage, where d'you think?</font>

629
00:42:33,065 --> 00:42:35,225
<font color="yellow">I just saw them, and I wanted them,</font>
<font color="yellow">and I bought them.</font>

<font color="yellow">..blood and cruelty.</font>

633
00:42:43,904 --> 00:42:45,824

00:42:59,424 --> 00:43:01,384
<font color="yellow">Just gets you down sometimes,</font>

636
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:07,864
<font color="cyan">Another bottle?</font>

<font color="yellow">Some sort of science research lab.</font>

690
00:46:07,544 --> 00:46:10,345
<font color="yellow">Attached to Cardinal College,</font>
<font color="yellow">so far as I can make out.</font>

691
00:46:10,385 --> 00:46:11,945
<font color="cyan">Who's the deceased?</font>

692
00:46:11,985 --> 00:46:13,544
<font color="yellow">Dr Naomi Benford.</font>

693
00:46:13,584 --> 00:46:14,945
<font color="yellow">28 years old.</font>

694
00:46:16,224 --> 00:46:18,865
<font color="yellow">What?</font>
<font color="#008000">She's just so young.</font>

695
00:46:18,905 --> 00:46:20,064
Did you know her?

696
00:46:20,104 --> 00:46:21,744
<font color="#008000">I saw her about once or twice.</font>

697
00:46:21,785 --> 00:46:24,144
<font color="#008000">You know, early bird.</font>
<font color="#008000">But not to speak to.</font>

698
00:46:24,184 --> 00:46:26,104
You're all right though?
<font color="#008000">Yeah.</font>

699
00:46:26,144 --> 00:46:29,945
<font color="#008000">It was Reet's granddaughter,</font>
<font color="#008000">Bridget, that found her, not me.</font>

700
00:46:29,985 --> 00:46:31,345
It's you I'm married to.

701
00:46:32,505 --> 00:46:35,264
<font color="#008000">I saw worse on fire watch,</font>
<font color="#008000">in the war. Really.</font>

702
00:46:35,305 --> 00:46:36,664
<font color="#008000">I'm fine.</font>

703
00:46:36,704 --> 00:46:39,025
<font color="#008000">Now, go on. Do your job.</font>

704
00:46:46,224 --> 00:46:48,224
<font color="yellow">She'd just been picked</font>
<font color="yellow">to be on the television</font>

705
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:50,425
<font color="yellow">for some new academic</font>
<font color="yellow">broadcasting programme.</font>

706
00:46:50,465 --> 00:46:52,224
<font color="yellow">There's a bit in the Mail today.</font>

707
00:46:52,264 --> 00:46:54,905
<font color="yellow">Interview, she did with Miss Frazil.</font>

708
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:56,505
Family?

709
00:46:56,544 --> 00:46:59,064
<font color="yellow">Penge. Locals are notifying them.</font>

710
00:46:59,104 --> 00:47:01,584
<font color="yellow">But she had a flat in North Oxford.</font>

711
00:47:03,184 --> 00:47:05,544
<font color="#008000">Multiple catastrophic injuries</font>

712
00:47:05,584 --> 00:47:10,664
<font color="#008000">consistent with a high fall</font>
<font color="#008000">onto an unyielding surface.</font>

713
00:47:10,704 --> 00:47:12,505
<font color="#008000">Have to wait on the post-mortem</font>

714
00:47:12,544 --> 00:47:15,144
<font color="#008000">to establish</font>
<font color="#008000">exactly which killed her,</font>

715
00:47:15,184 --> 00:47:19,385
<font color="#008000">but there's perimortem hematoma</font>
<font color="#008000">to both upper arms.</font>

716
00:47:19,425 --> 00:47:22,305
<font color="#008000">Someone gripped her by the biceps,</font>

717
00:47:22,345 --> 00:47:24,465
<font color="#008000">firmly enough to bruise,</font>

718
00:47:24,505 --> 00:47:26,025
<font color="#008000">within moments of her decease.</font>

719
00:47:29,385 --> 00:47:30,465
When?

720
00:47:30,505 --> 00:47:32,744
<font color="#008000">Saturday evening, sometime?</font>

721
00:47:32,785 --> 00:47:35,624
<font color="#008000">Watch is stopped,</font>
<font color="#008000">just after eight to twelve.</font>

722
00:47:35,664 --> 00:47:38,704
<font color="yellow">You think this is connected</font>
<font color="yellow">to Molly Andrews?</font>

723
00:47:38,744 --> 00:47:40,184
<font color="cyan">Don't you?</font>

724
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:43,825
<font color="yellow">So, she calls the station</font>
<font color="yellow">Friday night,</font>

725
00:47:43,865 --> 00:47:46,025
<font color="yellow">claiming to have information</font>
<font color="yellow">on the Towpath Killer.</font>

726
00:47:46,064 --> 00:47:48,425
<font color="cyan">Only when I see her on Saturday,</font>
<font color="cyan">at Ruskin, she's got cold feet</font>

727
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:49,985
<font color="cyan">and says she needs</font>
<font color="cyan">to speak to someone</font>

728
00:47:50,025 --> 00:47:52,025
<font color="cyan">before she can disclose</font>
<font color="cyan">anything she knows.</font>

729
00:47:52,064 --> 00:47:53,425
And now she's dead.

730
00:47:54,945 --> 00:47:57,865
<font color="yellow">Somebody's killed her before she can</font>
<font color="yellow">spill what she knew about Molly.</font>

731
00:47:59,064 --> 00:48:00,184
<font color="yellow">Somebody here.</font>

732
00:48:01,264 --> 00:48:02,744
Who's in charge of this place?

733
00:48:02,785 --> 00:48:07,104
<font color="yellow">Head man's a Professor,</font>
<font color="yellow">Sir Donald Blish.</font>

734
00:48:07,144 --> 00:48:09,505
<font color="yellow">He's got tutorials this afternoon,</font>

735
00:48:09,544 --> 00:48:11,704
<font color="yellow">and never comes in</font>
<font color="yellow">on a Monday morning,</font>

736
00:48:11,744 --> 00:48:13,744
<font color="yellow">but one of the junior men is in.</font>

737
00:48:13,785 --> 00:48:16,184
<font color="yellow">A Dr Jeremy Kreitsek.</font>

738
00:48:17,544 --> 00:48:19,704
<font color="cyan">What is it you do here,</font>
<font color="cyan">Doctor Kreitsek?</font>

739
00:48:19,744 --> 00:48:23,305
<font color="#008000">We're examining certain aspects</font>
<font color="#008000">of human consciousness.</font>

740
00:48:23,345 --> 00:48:24,945
<font color="#008000">Psychic phenomena.</font>

741
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:28,744
<font color="#008000">Telekinesis.</font>
<font color="#008000">ESP - Extra Sensory Perception.</font>

742
00:48:28,785 --> 00:48:31,025
<font color="#008000">Telaesthesia -</font>
<font color="#008000">travelling clairvoyance</font>

743
00:48:31,064 --> 00:48:32,945
<font color="#008000">or remote viewing,</font>
<font color="#008000">if you prefer.</font>

744
00:48:32,985 --> 00:48:34,905
<font color="#008000">Some people</font>
<font color="#008000">call it distant seeing,</font>

745
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:37,465
<font color="#008000">but it all means the same thing.</font>
Which is what?

746
00:48:37,505 --> 00:48:42,104
<font color="#008000">A subject will be able to focus in</font>
<font color="#008000">on places they've never even been.</font>

747
00:48:42,144 --> 00:48:44,425
<font color="#008000">Could be next door</font>
<font color="#008000">or on the other side of the world,</font>

748
00:48:44,465 --> 00:48:47,305
<font color="#008000">and describe it</font>
<font color="#008000">with great clarity and detail.</font>

749
00:48:47,345 --> 00:48:49,465
<font color="#008000">All in their mind's eye.</font>

750
00:48:49,505 --> 00:48:51,945
<font color="#008000">People too,</font>
<font color="#008000">that have never even met.</font>

751
00:48:51,985 --> 00:48:53,865
<font color="cyan">So, do you get paid for this?</font>

752
00:48:53,905 --> 00:48:55,305
SNORTS

753
00:48:55,345 --> 00:48:56,544
<font color="#008000">I'm sure that to a layman</font>

754
00:48:56,584 --> 00:48:59,264
<font color="#008000">it all sounds like</font>
<font color="#008000">a whole lot of mumbo jumbo,</font>

755
00:48:59,305 --> 00:49:01,785
<font color="#008000">but Faraday was an early researcher.</font>

756
00:49:01,825 --> 00:49:03,624
<font color="#008000">Sir William Crookes,</font>
<font color="#008000">Rufus Osgood Mason.</font>

757
00:49:03,664 --> 00:49:06,264
<font color="#008000">They all believed the mind</font>
<font color="#008000">contains vast, untapped powers.</font>

758
00:49:06,305 --> 00:49:07,624
DOOR OPENS

759
00:49:09,785 --> 00:49:11,425
<font color="yellow">What's all this?</font>

760
00:49:11,465 --> 00:49:13,305
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

761
00:49:13,345 --> 00:49:16,144
<font color="#008000">It's Naomi.</font>
<font color="#008000">There's been some sort of accident.</font>

762
00:49:16,184 --> 00:49:17,985
<font color="#008000">The stairwell.</font>

763
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:22,744
<font color="#008000">I don't know what happened,</font>
<font color="#008000">but she's... she's dead.</font>

764
00:49:22,785 --> 00:49:25,544
<font color="#008000">These gentlemen are with the police.</font>

765
00:49:25,584 --> 00:49:28,264
<font color="yellow">What? No, that can't be right.</font>

766
00:49:28,305 --> 00:49:30,064
I'm afraid it is. Dr...?

767
00:49:30,104 --> 00:49:31,905
<font color="yellow">Ferman.</font>

768
00:49:31,945 --> 00:49:35,025
We'll need an account
of everyone's movements

769
00:49:35,064 --> 00:49:38,305
between Saturday afternoon
and Sunday morning.

770
00:49:38,345 --> 00:49:41,025
<font color="yellow">Well, I was in the pub</font>
<font color="yellow">on Saturday night.</font>

771
00:49:41,064 --> 00:49:44,345
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid what I did see</font>
<font color="yellow">of Sunday was beneath an eiderdown.</font>

772
00:49:44,385 --> 00:49:45,945
Which pub?

773
00:49:45,985 --> 00:49:48,144
<font color="yellow">The Baby And The Bird.</font>

774
00:49:48,184 --> 00:49:49,345
<font color="yellow">The Turl.</font>

775
00:49:49,385 --> 00:49:51,184
<font color="yellow">And, well, after that</font>
<font color="yellow">it gets a bit hazy.</font>

776
00:49:51,224 --> 00:49:52,865
Anyone vouch for you?

777
00:49:54,465 --> 00:49:55,905
<font color="yellow">Bar staff, I suppose.</font>

778
00:49:57,664 --> 00:49:59,264
What about you, Doctor Kreitsek?

779
00:49:59,305 --> 00:50:01,305
<font color="#008000">I was at The Tunnel, Saturday night.</font>

780
00:50:01,345 --> 00:50:02,584
<font color="#008000">It's a folk club.</font>

781
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:04,264
<font color="cyan">Oh, yeah. Who was on?</font>

782
00:50:04,305 --> 00:50:07,064
<font color="#008000">Who was playing?</font>
<font color="cyan">Mm-hm.</font>

783
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:08,744
<font color="#008000">Chap called Thackeray, I like.</font>

784
00:50:08,785 --> 00:50:10,144
<font color="#008000">Seen him at Braden's Week.</font>

785
00:50:10,184 --> 00:50:11,825
<font color="#008000">I've seen him a couple of times.</font>

786
00:50:11,865 --> 00:50:13,825
<font color="yellow">Doctor Benford been with you long?</font>

787
00:50:13,865 --> 00:50:16,704
Since, um, about autumn.

788
00:50:16,744 --> 00:50:18,624
<font color="cyan">What was her role here?</font>

789
00:50:18,664 --> 00:50:21,025
<font color="#008000">Junior research fellow.</font>

790
00:50:21,064 --> 00:50:23,224
<font color="#008000">Naomi carried out</font>
<font color="#008000">a number of our experiments.</font>

791
00:50:23,264 --> 00:50:25,505
What sort of experiments?

792
00:50:26,785 --> 00:50:30,104
<font color="#008000">The subject undergoes</font>
<font color="#008000">a period of sensory deprivation.</font>

793
00:50:30,144 --> 00:50:32,385
<font color="#008000">A red light is shone</font>
<font color="#008000">on ping-pong balls,</font>

794
00:50:32,425 --> 00:50:35,104
<font color="#008000">which are cut in half</font>
<font color="#008000">and placed over the eyes.</font>

795
00:50:35,144 --> 00:50:37,825
<font color="#008000">At the same time,</font>
<font color="#008000">headphones play white noise.</font>

796
00:50:37,865 --> 00:50:39,305
What's the game there, then?

797
00:50:39,345 --> 00:50:42,985
<font color="yellow">Well, the idea is to clear the mind</font>
<font color="yellow">of any external stimuli</font>

798
00:50:43,025 --> 00:50:45,704
<font color="yellow">in order that the subject might</font>
<font color="yellow">become more receptive,</font>

799
00:50:45,744 --> 00:50:48,664
<font color="yellow">more attuned to their</font>
<font color="yellow">extra sensory potential.</font>

800
00:50:48,704 --> 00:50:50,465
And do they?

801
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:52,385
<font color="yellow">Some, yeah.</font>

802
00:50:52,425 --> 00:50:54,584
<font color="yellow">Once the subject</font>
<font color="yellow">is suitably prepared,</font>

803
00:50:54,624 --> 00:50:57,345
<font color="yellow">the tester turns through</font>
<font color="yellow">a collection of flash cards</font>

804
00:50:57,385 --> 00:50:59,544
<font color="yellow">which show various</font>
<font color="yellow">geometric symbols.</font>

805
00:50:59,584 --> 00:51:02,224
<font color="yellow">Like, er, triangles, squares,</font>
<font color="yellow">circles, wavy lines and that.</font>

806
00:51:02,264 --> 00:51:04,264
<font color="yellow">The subject tries to see</font>
<font color="yellow">what's on the cards.</font>

807
00:51:04,305 --> 00:51:05,744
<font color="cyan">Triangle.</font>

808
00:51:07,184 --> 00:51:08,305
Anything in it?

809
00:51:08,345 --> 00:51:10,505
<font color="#008000">Some subjects show</font>
<font color="#008000">an above average aptitude</font>

810
00:51:10,544 --> 00:51:12,505
<font color="#008000">for correctly</font>
<font color="#008000">identifying the symbols.</font>

811
00:51:12,544 --> 00:51:15,425
<font color="cyan">And some subjects show</font>
<font color="cyan">a below average aptitude, I assume.</font>

812
00:51:15,465 --> 00:51:16,945
<font color="cyan">Given the nature of averages.</font>

813
00:51:16,985 --> 00:51:21,345
<font color="#008000">Look, the government show us a lot</font>
<font color="#008000">of respect for the work we do here.</font>

814
00:51:21,385 --> 00:51:25,305
<font color="#008000">Perhaps you might want to extend</font>
<font color="#008000">the same respect that it warrants.</font>

815
00:51:25,345 --> 00:51:27,744
Well, to get back
to the matter in hand,

816
00:51:27,785 --> 00:51:31,305
did Dr Benford have a boyfriend,
or...?

817
00:51:31,345 --> 00:51:33,224
<font color="#008000">Not so far as I know.</font>

818
00:51:33,264 --> 00:51:34,704
<font color="#008000">Well, I can't say we were close.</font>

819
00:51:34,744 --> 00:51:36,064
When did you last see her?

820
00:51:36,104 --> 00:51:37,985
<font color="#008000">Saturday afternoon.</font>

821
00:51:38,025 --> 00:51:39,385
Here?

822
00:51:42,905 --> 00:51:44,144
<font color="cyan">Doctor?</font>

823
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:47,264
KNOCK AT DOOR

824
00:51:50,505 --> 00:51:52,305
<font color="cyan">Good morning.</font>

825
00:51:52,345 --> 00:51:54,624
<font color="cyan">Detective Sergeant Morse -</font>
<font color="cyan">Chief Inspector Thursday.</font>

826
00:51:54,664 --> 00:51:56,985
<font color="cyan">From Thames Valley.</font>
<font color="cyan">We're looking for a Professor Blish.</font>

827
00:51:57,025 --> 00:51:59,345
<font color="#008000">Donald. My husband.</font>

828
00:51:59,385 --> 00:52:01,544
<font color="#008000">He's in the garden.</font>
<font color="#008000">Won't you come in?</font>

829
00:52:10,664 --> 00:52:12,544
Thought I heard the door.

830
00:52:12,584 --> 00:52:13,825
<font color="#008000">The police, darling.</font>

831
00:52:13,865 --> 00:52:15,544
<font color="#008000">Someone at college has died.</font>

832
00:52:15,584 --> 00:52:17,144
<font color="#008000">A Dr Benford?</font>

833
00:52:17,184 --> 00:52:19,704
Naomi?
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid so, sir.</font>

834
00:52:19,744 --> 00:52:22,945
<font color="yellow">Detective Chief Inspector Thursday,</font>
<font color="yellow">Detective Sergeant Morse.</font>

835
00:52:22,985 --> 00:52:25,744
<font color="#008000">Would you like tea,</font>
<font color="#008000">or something stronger?</font>

836
00:52:25,785 --> 00:52:27,945
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Mrs Blish,</font>
<font color="yellow">we won't if it's all the same.</font>

837
00:52:27,985 --> 00:52:29,184
<font color="#008000">Sorry...</font>

838
00:52:29,224 --> 00:52:33,025
<font color="#008000">Darling, if I could just trouble you</font>
<font color="#008000">for a cheque for Querels</font>

839
00:52:33,064 --> 00:52:34,584
<font color="#008000">and then I'll be out of your hair.</font>

840
00:52:37,064 --> 00:52:38,584
<font color="#008000">I've made out the amount.</font>

841
00:52:40,264 --> 00:52:41,624
<font color="#008000">The butchers.</font>

842
00:52:41,664 --> 00:52:43,905
<font color="#008000">Only, I'm not allowed</font>
<font color="#008000">my own chequebook.</font>

843
00:52:43,945 --> 00:52:46,544
<font color="#008000">In case my head explodes</font>
<font color="#008000">and falls off (!)</font>

844
00:52:46,584 --> 00:52:47,905
Quite right.

845
00:52:47,945 --> 00:52:50,224
Do you let your wife
have her own chequebook?

846
00:52:50,264 --> 00:52:54,144
I know it's all the fashion,
but money, seems to me, a man's job.

847
00:52:54,184 --> 00:52:55,704
There we are, darling.

848
00:52:55,744 --> 00:52:57,505
<font color="#008000">If there's anything you want,</font>
<font color="#008000">just shout.</font>

849
00:52:59,785 --> 00:53:01,664
At the Department, you say?

850
00:53:02,905 --> 00:53:04,465
Poor girl.

851
00:53:04,505 --> 00:53:06,144
But how? I don't understand.

852
00:53:06,184 --> 00:53:08,345
Was there some sort of accident,
or...?

853
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:10,544
<font color="yellow">A fall, sir, but hopefully,</font>
<font color="yellow">with your help,</font>

854
00:53:10,584 --> 00:53:12,425
<font color="yellow">we'll be able to get</font>
<font color="yellow">to the bottom of it.</font>

855
00:53:12,465 --> 00:53:14,224
<font color="yellow">When did you last</font>
<font color="yellow">see Dr Benford?</font>

856
00:53:15,465 --> 00:53:17,704
Saturday, it would have been.

857
00:53:17,744 --> 00:53:19,664
Half-past five or thereabouts.

858
00:53:19,704 --> 00:53:24,104
She'd been over at Ruskin in the
morning for this women's conference,

859
00:53:24,144 --> 00:53:26,505
and then came in for a few hours
after lunch.

860
00:53:26,544 --> 00:53:28,825
<font color="cyan">Was there anyone with her</font>
<font color="cyan">when you left?</font>

861
00:53:28,865 --> 00:53:30,425
Not that I saw.

862
00:53:30,465 --> 00:53:33,465
But I wouldn't expect anyone
to be in the lab much after that.

863
00:53:33,505 --> 00:53:35,785
She said she had
some work to finish.

864
00:53:37,865 --> 00:53:41,465
<font color="cyan">Did she ever mention a young woman</font>
<font color="cyan">killed on the towpath at New Year?</font>

865
00:53:41,505 --> 00:53:43,184
<font color="cyan">Molly Andrews.</font>

866
00:53:43,224 --> 00:53:45,104
<font color="cyan">She was a barmaid at The Grapes.</font>

867
00:53:48,264 --> 00:53:49,785
I read about it, of course.

868
00:53:49,825 --> 00:53:50,945
Awful thing. But I...

869
00:53:50,985 --> 00:53:53,224
I don't remember Naomi
ever mentioning it.

870
00:53:55,425 --> 00:53:56,704
<font color="cyan">Really?</font>

871
00:53:56,744 --> 00:54:00,184
<font color="cyan">Only, she intimated that there</font>
<font color="cyan">were some professional protocol</font>

872
00:54:00,224 --> 00:54:03,664
<font color="cyan">that she were obliged to follow,</font>
<font color="cyan">before being able to discuss it.</font>

873
00:54:03,704 --> 00:54:06,704
I'm afraid I'm at a loss to explain
what she might have meant by that.

874
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:10,305
<font color="yellow">We have it that you quarrelled</font>
<font color="yellow">with her on Saturday afternoon.</font>

875
00:54:10,345 --> 00:54:14,264
Well, I wouldn't call it a quarrel.
We had a frank exchange of views.

876
00:54:14,305 --> 00:54:16,624
<font color="yellow">You upset her, supposedly.</font>

877
00:54:18,385 --> 00:54:20,664
Really? Well,
I'm afraid it doesn't take much.

878
00:54:20,704 --> 00:54:22,624
They don't respond well
to criticism.

879
00:54:22,664 --> 00:54:24,825
<font color="cyan">What was the nature</font>
<font color="cyan">of this criticism?</font>

880
00:54:24,865 --> 00:54:28,104
I felt she had become
less than rigorous in her work.

881
00:54:28,144 --> 00:54:30,305
Her mind was on
this television business.

882
00:54:30,345 --> 00:54:31,744
<font color="yellow">You disapproved?</font>

883
00:54:31,785 --> 00:54:36,104
One can either be a serious academic
or a frivolous person.

884
00:54:36,144 --> 00:54:39,985
On the whole, I think women are too
emotional for the life scientific.

885
00:54:40,025 --> 00:54:42,704
<font color="cyan">That will come as grave news</font>
<font color="cyan">to Madam Curie, I'm sure.</font>

886
00:54:42,744 --> 00:54:43,945
SCOFFS
Hm, well...

887
00:54:43,985 --> 00:54:45,385
I'm not sure I'd offer up someone

888
00:54:45,425 --> 00:54:47,785
who managed to give themselves
radiation poisoning

889
00:54:47,825 --> 00:54:49,345
as a shining example.

890
00:54:49,385 --> 00:54:51,624
They just get under your feet
in the lab.

891
00:54:51,664 --> 00:54:53,544
If they're not crying about
who they do love,

892
00:54:53,584 --> 00:54:56,224
they're crying about
who doesn't love them.

893
00:54:56,264 --> 00:54:58,264
It's a distraction.

894
00:54:58,305 --> 00:55:01,064
<font color="cyan">There's a don like that in every</font>
<font color="cyan">other common room in Oxford.</font>

895
00:55:01,104 --> 00:55:03,264
<font color="cyan">His experience of the</font>
<font color="cyan">other half of humankind</font>

896
00:55:03,305 --> 00:55:05,664
<font color="cyan">starts with matron</font>
<font color="cyan">and doesn't get much further.</font>

897
00:55:05,704 --> 00:55:07,505
<font color="cyan">Women are only good</font>
<font color="cyan">for ironing their shirts</font>

898
00:55:07,544 --> 00:55:09,744
<font color="cyan">and making sure the cruet's filled</font>
<font color="cyan">at the high table.</font>

899
00:55:09,785 --> 00:55:12,425
<font color="yellow">Anything in it, d'you think?</font>
<font color="yellow">This, er, sixth sense business.</font>

900
00:55:12,465 --> 00:55:14,624
<font color="yellow">I've always had it down</font>
<font color="yellow">for a load of old baloney.</font>

901
00:55:14,664 --> 00:55:17,264
<font color="yellow">I mean, if you had the gift</font>
<font color="yellow">of second sight, or whatever it is,</font>

902
00:55:17,305 --> 00:55:19,144
<font color="yellow">you'd be down the bookies,</font>
<font color="yellow">wouldn't you,</font>

903
00:55:19,184 --> 00:55:21,584
<font color="yellow">not trying to see what Mr Brezhnev's</font>
<font color="yellow">got in his briefcase.</font>

904
00:55:21,624 --> 00:55:23,785
<font color="cyan">Yes, but we all get</font>
<font color="cyan">feelings don't we?</font>

905
00:55:23,825 --> 00:55:25,305
<font color="cyan">Like what you had</font>
<font color="cyan">about Carl Sturgis,</font>

906
00:55:25,345 --> 00:55:28,025
<font color="cyan">only we call them hunches.</font>
<font color="yellow">That's experience, though, isn't it?</font>

907
00:55:28,064 --> 00:55:30,224
<font color="yellow">It's not something</font>
<font color="yellow">from the great beyond.</font>

908
00:55:30,264 --> 00:55:32,144
<font color="yellow">Mrs Blish.</font>
<font color="#008000">Hm.</font>

909
00:55:58,704 --> 00:56:00,465
BIRD CAWS

910
00:56:13,544 --> 00:56:15,504
It's always the ones you like.

911
00:56:15,544 --> 00:56:18,265
<font color="yellow">I read your piece.</font>
<font color="yellow">What do you make of her?</font>

912
00:56:18,305 --> 00:56:20,544
Clever, beautiful, funny.

913
00:56:20,584 --> 00:56:22,104
Excited about the television.

914
00:56:22,144 --> 00:56:24,584
Whoever hired her
knew what they were doing. <font color="yellow">How so?</font>

915
00:56:24,624 --> 00:56:26,584
Well, they could have
hired some dusty old don,

916
00:56:26,624 --> 00:56:27,984
no-one would have turned a hair,

917
00:56:28,024 --> 00:56:30,305
but put an intelligent
young woman on screen...

918
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:31,745
SHE TUTS

919
00:56:31,785 --> 00:56:33,064
<font color="yellow">Was she attached?</font>

920
00:56:33,104 --> 00:56:34,944
She said not.

921
00:56:34,984 --> 00:56:36,865
Was it an accident?

922
00:56:36,905 --> 00:56:38,825
<font color="yellow">Well, that's what</font>
<font color="yellow">I'm here to find out.</font>

923
00:56:38,865 --> 00:56:40,785
She did ask me, off the record,

924
00:56:40,825 --> 00:56:43,144
if I'd heard anything
about the towpath at New Year.

925
00:56:43,185 --> 00:56:45,745
The barmaid at The Grapes.

926
00:56:45,785 --> 00:56:46,944
<font color="yellow">Such as?</font>

927
00:56:46,984 --> 00:56:50,185
Oh, anything the police might've
been keeping from the public.

928
00:56:50,225 --> 00:56:53,064
Seemed a strange thing to ask.
<font color="yellow">Hm.</font>

929
00:56:53,104 --> 00:56:55,345
<font color="yellow">Did she say</font>
<font color="yellow">what her interest would be?</font>

930
00:56:55,385 --> 00:56:56,464
SHE SIGHS

931
00:56:56,504 --> 00:56:58,425
Behalf of a friend, she said.

932
00:56:58,464 --> 00:57:00,305
You think that's connected?

933
00:57:00,345 --> 00:57:02,464
<font color="yellow">Oh, really, I couldn't say.</font>

934
00:57:02,504 --> 00:57:06,705
<font color="yellow">And any avoidance of speculation</font>
<font color="yellow">in print ahead of a formal statement</font>

935
00:57:06,745 --> 00:57:07,984
<font color="yellow">would be greatly appreciated.</font>

936
00:57:08,024 --> 00:57:09,624
It'll cost you.

937
00:57:09,664 --> 00:57:11,345
<font color="yellow">Oh, it always does. But, thank you.</font>

938
00:57:11,385 --> 00:57:13,984
Just make sure you get the bastard.

939
00:57:14,024 --> 00:57:15,305
She was all right.

940
00:57:53,944 --> 00:57:55,464
<font color="yellow">Where's all this come from?</font>

941
00:57:55,504 --> 00:57:59,464
<font color="cyan">The handbag. Pen was under her body.</font>

942
00:57:59,504 --> 00:58:01,664
<font color="cyan">A few bits and pieces</font>
<font color="cyan">had fallen out,</font>

943
00:58:01,705 --> 00:58:04,464
<font color="cyan">lipstick, a compact, address book.</font>

944
00:58:04,504 --> 00:58:06,345
<font color="#008000">Anything else?</font>
<font color="cyan">Afraid not.</font>

945
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,225
<font color="yellow">Hmm...</font>

946
00:58:09,265 --> 00:58:12,504
<font color="yellow">According to the diary</font>
<font color="yellow">at her flat,</font>

947
00:58:12,544 --> 00:58:14,705
<font color="yellow">Dr Benford was supposed to meet</font>
<font color="yellow">a Jennifer Tate</font>

948
00:58:14,745 --> 00:58:16,464
<font color="yellow">on Saturday at eight o'clock.</font>

949
00:58:16,504 --> 00:58:17,584
<font color="#008000">A friend?</font>

950
00:58:17,624 --> 00:58:19,905
<font color="yellow">Well, if she was,</font>

952
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:25,584
<font color="yellow">Doctor Benford had also asked</font>
<font color="yellow">Dorothea Frazil,</font>

953
00:58:25,624 --> 00:58:27,104
<font color="yellow">if there was anything she'd heard of</font>

00:58:27,144 --> 00:58:30,144
<font color="yellow">that we'd kept back from the public</font>
<font color="yellow">about the towpath killing.</font>

955
00:58:30,185 --> 00:58:32,664
<font color="yellow">She had clippings</font>
<font color="yellow">related to the case upon her desk.</font>

00:58:58,624 --> 00:59:00,225
I was in the neighbourhood.

963
00:59:00,265 --> 00:59:02,185
If it's a bad time?

<font color="yellow">No. No, no.</font>

967
00:59:18,584 --> 00:59:20,345
I like what you've done
with the place.

968
00:59:20,385 --> 00:59:21,865
You might want to let that breathe.

Oh, my God!

974
00:59:47,345 --> 00:59:50,905
You have the Calloway
'54 Traviata from La Scala.

975
00:59:50,944 --> 00:59:52,385
I've never heard it.

<font color="yellow">some new recording system.</font>

979
00:59:57,984 --> 00:59:59,745
Can I hear it?

980
01:00:01,225 --> 01:00:03,024
<font color="yellow">Well, you can have it.</font>

981
01:00:03,064 --> 01:00:04,544
You are joking, I can have it?

982
01:00:04,584 --> 01:00:05,624
Do you know how rare it is?

983
01:00:05,664 --> 01:00:07,305
<font color="yellow">No, I haven't listened to it</font>
<font color="yellow">for years.</font>

<font color="yellow">So, to what do I owe the, er..?</font>

986
01:00:18,664 --> 01:00:20,905
I'm having a few people around
to my place at the weekend.

987
01:00:20,944 --> 01:00:23,144
A few drinks. I haven't seen you.

988
01:00:23,185 --> 01:00:25,345
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes, I've just been busy.</font>
<font color="yellow">With work.</font>

989
01:00:25,385 --> 01:00:27,544
What devilish conundrum
currently occupies the mind

990
01:00:27,584 --> 01:00:28,944
of the great detective?

991
01:00:32,785 --> 01:00:34,584
Murder in pursuit of robbery.

992
01:00:36,385 --> 01:00:37,584
<font color="yellow">What makes you say that?</font>

993
01:00:39,745 --> 01:00:40,825
Her necklace.

994
01:00:41,865 --> 01:00:43,225
That's what he took.

995
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:46,024
That's what made those marks
on her neck.

996
01:00:46,064 --> 01:00:47,785
The chain, as he tore it away.

997
01:00:50,504 --> 01:00:52,745
We were occupied... during the war.

998
01:00:54,425 --> 01:00:56,104
There was a girl.

999
01:00:56,144 --> 01:00:59,305
Young girl,
daughter of one of our staff.

1000
01:00:59,345 --> 01:01:00,944
14? 15?

1001
01:01:03,185 --> 01:01:05,305
She wore a St Christopher.

1002
01:01:06,544 --> 01:01:08,504
One of the soldiers, erm...

1003
01:01:11,305 --> 01:01:13,544
Playing in the woods,
I found her body.

1004
01:01:15,584 --> 01:01:17,544
The marks on her neck
were like this.

1005
01:01:20,064 --> 01:01:22,865
I'm sorry, I have never
told anyone that story before.

1006
01:01:23,944 --> 01:01:25,825
I, erm...

1007
01:01:25,865 --> 01:01:27,624
I had forgotten it
until I saw that.

1008

<font color="yellow">Can't... I can't imagine.</font>

1009
01:01:33,984 --> 01:01:38,265
No. You know,
I think that's why I'm drawn...

1010
01:01:38,305 --> 01:01:40,305
to the beautiful things in life.

I thought it must be.

<font color="yellow">How's that?</font>

1050
01:03:31,504 --> 01:03:33,825
Well, Naomi said it'd be passed
to the police months ago.

1051
01:03:33,865 --> 01:03:36,104
Right after it happened.

1052
01:03:36,144 --> 01:03:37,345
<font color="yellow">What would?</font>

1053
01:03:37,385 --> 01:03:38,984
What I told her.

1054
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:42,345
About the girl on the towpath
at New Year.

1055
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:43,905
<font color="#008000">What did you tell her?</font>

1056
01:03:43,944 --> 01:03:45,385
What I saw.

1057
01:03:47,265 --> 01:03:48,504
The man who did it.

1058
01:03:50,185 --> 01:03:51,664
<font color="#008000">You saw who killed Molly Andrews?</font>

<font color="#008000">You were on the Towpath that night?</font>

1060
01:03:53,345 --> 01:03:56,345
No. Not exactly.

1061
01:03:56,385 --> 01:03:58,225
<font color="#008000">What do you mean?</font>
<font color="#008000">You said you saw who did it?</font>

1062
01:03:58,265 --> 01:04:00,785
Yes, I did, like...

1063
01:04:02,225 --> 01:04:03,664
..in my head.

1064
01:04:05,544 --> 01:04:06,984
It was a vision.

1065
01:04:08,385 --> 01:04:11,305
<font color="#008000">Well, we're very grateful</font>

You don't believe me.

01:04:13,305 --> 01:04:15,944

<font color="#008000">Physical evidence.</font>

1069
01:04:19,185 --> 01:04:21,504
He took her necklace, didn't he?

1070
01:04:21,544 --> 01:04:22,984
<font color="#008000">We're not at liberty...</font>

1072
01:04:25,425 --> 01:04:26,705
<font color="yellow">Did you see his face?</font>

1073
01:04:26,745 --> 01:04:28,064
No.

1074
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:30,865
But I felt him.

1075
01:04:30,905 --> 01:04:34,185
This... anger.

1076
01:04:35,624 --> 01:04:37,104
This hatred.

1077
01:04:37,144 --> 01:04:38,624
Something evil.

1078
01:04:40,584 --> 01:04:42,705
And the taste, I could...

1079
01:04:44,425 --> 01:04:46,785
..taste it in my mouth,
on my tongue.

1080
01:04:46,825 --> 01:04:48,745
<font color="yellow">Taste what?</font>

1081
01:04:51,144 --> 01:04:52,464
Blood.

1082
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:57,544
<font color="cyan">Blood?</font>

1083
01:04:57,584 --> 01:04:59,944
That's what she said, sir.

1084
01:04:59,984 --> 01:05:02,104
<font color="yellow">There was no blood.</font>

1085
01:05:02,144 --> 01:05:03,944
<font color="yellow">Not at the scene.</font>

1086
01:05:03,984 --> 01:05:05,865
<font color="yellow">Certainly, none from Molly Andrews.</font>

1087
01:05:05,905 --> 01:05:08,064
<font color="cyan">Is it possible, do you think?</font>

1088
01:05:10,024 --> 01:05:12,265
<font color="cyan">This girl could literally have seen</font>

1089
01:05:12,305 --> 01:05:14,745
<font color="cyan">what passed on the towpath</font>
<font color="cyan">that night?</font>

1090
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:17,584
<font color="#008000">Well, I'm not one</font>
<font color="#008000">for the macabre, sir.</font>

1091
01:05:19,745 --> 01:05:22,865
<font color="#008000">The way she described it all...</font>

1092
01:05:22,905 --> 01:05:27,104
<font color="#008000">Maybe you'd have had to have been</font>
<font color="#008000">there, but she did seem sincere,</font>

1093
01:05:27,144 --> 01:05:30,104
<font color="#008000">if you're at all susceptible</font>
<font color="#008000">to that way of thinking.</font>

1094
01:05:30,144 --> 01:05:32,305
Susceptible or not,
she knew about the necklace.

1095
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:34,705
It's that which caused the marks
to Molly Andrews's neck.

1096
01:05:34,745 --> 01:05:35,944
The killer tore it from her.

1097
01:05:37,624 --> 01:05:39,385
<font color="cyan">A keepsake, perhaps?</font>

1098
01:05:40,785 --> 01:05:42,745
<font color="cyan">And what of this</font>
<font color="cyan">television programme</font>

1099
01:05:42,785 --> 01:05:45,664
<font color="cyan">that Doctor Benford</font>
<font color="cyan">was involved with, anything there?</font>

1100
01:05:45,705 --> 01:05:47,504
<font color="yellow">I spoke to the producer, sir.</font>

1101
01:05:47,544 --> 01:05:49,185
<font color="yellow">A chap called Ray Douglas.</font>

1102
01:05:49,225 --> 01:05:53,504
<font color="yellow">Quite flamboyant, as is often</font>
<font color="yellow">the way with these people,</font>

1103
01:05:53,544 --> 01:05:56,544
<font color="yellow">but in his words</font>
<font color="yellow">Doctor Benford was a natural.</font>

1104
01:05:56,584 --> 01:05:58,745
<font color="yellow">She had a...</font>

1105
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:04,185
<font color="yellow">Yeah, here we are.</font>

1106
01:06:04,225 --> 01:06:07,785
<font color="yellow">"She had a very easy rapport</font>
<font color="yellow">with the camera</font>

1107
01:06:07,825 --> 01:06:09,944
<font color="yellow">"and the camera loved her.</font>

1108
01:06:09,984 --> 01:06:12,185
<font color="yellow">"I think we knew</font>
<font color="yellow">as soon as we saw her</font>

1109
01:06:12,225 --> 01:06:15,504
<font color="yellow">"that we'd found our presenter</font>
<font color="yellow">for the Higher Maths module."</font>

1110
01:06:15,544 --> 01:06:17,944
Did they interview
many people for the post?

1111
01:06:17,984 --> 01:06:19,185
<font color="yellow">Audition.</font>

1112
01:06:20,225 --> 01:06:21,984
<font color="yellow">Hundreds, apparently.</font>

1113
01:06:22,024 --> 01:06:25,425
<font color="yellow">Anyone with a half decent science</font>
<font color="yellow">degree in Oxford put in for it,</font>

1114
01:06:25,464 --> 01:06:27,624
<font color="yellow">including one or two</font>
<font color="yellow">from her own department.</font>

1115
01:06:29,544 --> 01:06:31,345
<font color="cyan">I just went along</font>
<font color="cyan">to see what it was all about.</font>

1116
01:06:31,385 --> 01:06:33,305
<font color="cyan">Didn't expect to get</font>
<font color="cyan">very far with it at all.</font>

1117
01:06:33,345 --> 01:06:35,064
<font color="cyan">I wasn't disappointed.</font>

1118
01:06:35,104 --> 01:06:37,385
<font color="#008000">I think I knew at once</font>
<font color="#008000">that I wasn't the sort of thing</font>

1119
01:06:37,425 --> 01:06:39,425
<font color="#008000">they were looking for.</font>
<font color="#008000">That none of us were.</font>

1120
01:06:39,464 --> 01:06:41,064
How's that?

1121
01:06:41,104 --> 01:06:44,144
<font color="#008000">Sex, isn't it?</font>
<font color="#008000">That's what it's all about nowadays.</font>

1122
01:06:44,185 --> 01:06:46,544
<font color="#008000">That's what sells.</font>
<font color="#008000">Sex appeal.</font>

1123
01:06:46,584 --> 01:06:49,785
<font color="#008000">I mean, why bother hiring a fella</font>
<font color="#008000">who knows what he's talking about</font>

1124
01:06:49,825 --> 01:06:51,584
<font color="#008000">when you can put a pair</font>
<font color="#008000">of knockers on screen?</font>

1125
01:06:51,624 --> 01:06:53,225
<font color="yellow">For an academic programme?</font>

1126
01:06:54,425 --> 01:06:55,705
<font color="#008000">For anything, my boy.</font>

1127
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:57,464
<font color="#008000">From soap suds to Japanese cars.</font>

1128
01:06:57,504 --> 01:07:00,705
<font color="#008000">You see it at the motor show,</font>
<font color="#008000">at the boat show, in the papers now.</font>

1129
01:07:00,745 --> 01:07:03,464
<font color="#008000">I mean, it's not us blokes they've</font>
<font color="#008000">got sprawled all over everything,</font>

1130
01:07:03,504 --> 01:07:05,064
<font color="#008000">showing the world</font>
<font color="#008000">what we've got, is it?</font>

1131
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:06,425
<font color="cyan">I think that's a bit unnecessary.</font>

1132
01:07:06,464 --> 01:07:08,024
<font color="cyan">I won't have you talking</font>
<font color="cyan">smut about her.</font>

1133
01:07:08,064 --> 01:07:10,345
<font color="cyan">We were friends.</font>
<font color="#008000">Ha, friends!</font>

1134
01:07:10,385 --> 01:07:12,944
<font color="#008000">Jeremy had a soft spot for her,</font>
<font color="#008000">didn't you, eh?</font>

1135
01:07:12,984 --> 01:07:14,464
<font color="#008000">Well soft-ish (!)</font>

1136
01:07:14,504 --> 01:07:16,664
<font color="#008000">Asked her out the week</font>
<font color="#008000">she started, didn't you?</font>

1137
01:07:16,705 --> 01:07:19,144
<font color="#008000">But she turned him down flat.</font>
<font color="#008000">Shame (!)</font>

1138
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:22,745
You never mentioned.

1139
01:07:22,785 --> 01:07:25,785
<font color="cyan">I asked her out once, for a drink.</font>

1140
01:07:25,825 --> 01:07:27,385
<font color="cyan">She said no.</font>

1141
01:07:27,425 --> 01:07:29,425
<font color="cyan">She was under no obligation anyway.</font>

1142
01:07:30,825 --> 01:07:33,345
<font color="cyan">I wasn't her type, clearly.</font>
<font color="cyan">That's all there was to it.</font>

1143
01:07:33,385 --> 01:07:35,544
<font color="#008000">Not her type? You didn't have</font>
<font color="#008000">anything to offer her.</font>

1144
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:37,305
<font color="#008000">That's why you weren't her type.</font>

1145
01:07:37,345 --> 01:07:38,544
<font color="#008000">No leg up, no leg over.</font>

1146
01:07:38,584 --> 01:07:39,624
<font color="#008000">You wanna wake up, man.</font>

1147
01:07:39,664 --> 01:07:41,825
<font color="#008000">It's not a battle of the sexes,</font>
<font color="#008000">it's war, mate.</font>

1148
01:07:41,865 --> 01:07:42,984
<font color="#008000">And they've got the bazookas.</font>

1149
01:07:43,024 --> 01:07:45,504
<font color="#008000">How's your poor little pea-shooter</font>
<font color="#008000">gonna compete with that?</font>

1150
01:07:45,544 --> 01:07:47,064
<font color="#008000">I'll tell you, it's not.</font>

1151
01:07:59,024 --> 01:08:00,265
Sam.

1152
01:08:00,305 --> 01:08:01,504
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

1153
01:08:16,019 --> 01:08:19,339
We're proceeding upon the assumption
that, what?

1154
01:08:19,379 --> 01:08:21,740
The towpath killing
and the murder of Dr Benford

1155
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:23,740
are the work of the same hand?

1156
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:27,379
<font color="yellow">Potentially, sir. But in truth,</font>
<font color="yellow">there's very little to go on.</font>

1157
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:29,540
Her colleagues at work?

1158
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:32,179
<font color="yellow">Only one of them</font>
<font color="yellow">has a solid alibi, sir.</font>

1159
01:08:32,219 --> 01:08:33,339
<font color="yellow">Professor Blish.</font>

1160
01:08:33,379 --> 01:08:35,139
<font color="yellow">At home with his wife.</font>

1161
01:08:35,179 --> 01:08:39,019
He denied Dr Benford had mentioned
the towpath killing to him.

1162
01:08:39,059 --> 01:08:40,179
If he'd lie about that...

1163
01:08:40,219 --> 01:08:43,299
<font color="cyan">Well we've only really got</font>
<font color="cyan">Jenny Tate's word to go on, sir.</font>

1164
01:08:43,339 --> 01:08:48,019
You said Kreitsek had interviewed
for this television post

1165
01:08:48,059 --> 01:08:49,740
and had been turned down?

1166
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:51,700
Something in that?
Professional jealousy.

1167
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:55,179
<font color="cyan">Hmm. Ferman seemed</font>
<font color="cyan">rather bitter about it.</font>

1168
01:08:55,219 --> 01:08:59,420
<font color="cyan">Put her getting the job</font>
<font color="cyan">down to her natural advantages.</font>

1169
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:01,820
And Professor Blish?

1170
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:03,820
What was his position
with regard

1171
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:07,179
to Dr Benford's part
in these educational programmes?

1172
01:09:07,219 --> 01:09:08,460
<font color="yellow">Far as we could make out, sir,</font>

1173
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:11,099
<font color="yellow">he's none too keen on having women</font>
<font color="yellow">in his department at all.</font>

1174
01:09:11,139 --> 01:09:13,500
<font color="yellow">Only had her there on sufferance.</font>

1175
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:15,900
<font color="#008000">Word just through</font>
<font color="#008000">from Birmingham, sir.</font>

1176
01:09:15,939 --> 01:09:18,540
<font color="#008000">Petrovski, the bargee who</font>
<font color="#008000">passed through Braunston Junction</font>

1177
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:20,460
<font color="#008000">in the early hours</font>
<font color="#008000">of January 1st.</font>

1178
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:23,820
<font color="#008000">Collapsed on his boat yesterday</font>
<font color="#008000">afternoon near Gas Street Basin.</font>

1179
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:29,780
<font color="#008000">Apparently, he died</font>
<font color="#008000">of alcohol poisoning.</font>

1180
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:34,780
<font color="#008000">Sister says he'd never hurt a fly,</font>
<font color="#008000">but just couldn't resist a drink.</font>

1181
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:36,420
Yeah, the place is full of empties.

1182
01:09:38,259 --> 01:09:40,460
<font color="#008000">Look, I got a bone to pick with you.</font>

1183
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:41,660
Oh, yeah?

1184
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:44,900
<font color="#008000">I didn't think much to you</font>
<font color="#008000">hanging the old man out to dry.</font>

1185
01:09:44,939 --> 01:09:47,540
I've read the case files.

1186
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:49,860
The first 48 hours
of the Molly Andrews' investigation

1187
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:51,179
were slipshod at best.

1188
01:09:51,219 --> 01:09:52,219
<font color="#008000">Slipshod?</font>

1189
01:09:52,259 --> 01:09:54,860
Yeah, all right, shabby, then,
if you'd sooner.

1190
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:57,299
Poor record keeping.
Statements misfiled.

1191
01:09:57,339 --> 01:09:59,700
In short, it was a catalogue
of errors from start to finish.

1192
01:10:00,979 --> 01:10:04,099
<font color="#008000">We were short-handed,</font>
<font color="#008000">with the New Year.</font>

1193
01:10:04,139 --> 01:10:06,379
<font color="#008000">You know Ainsley's</font>
<font color="#008000">rubbish on exhibits.</font>

1194
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:08,099
<font color="#008000">If you hadn't been on leave...</font>

1195
01:10:08,139 --> 01:10:10,540
Yeah, well, if people had
done their job in the first place,

1196
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:12,540
then perhaps Naomi Benford
might still be alive.

1197
01:10:14,299 --> 01:10:16,780
Anyway, Molly's boyfriend,

1198
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:18,939
Carl Sturgis?

1199
01:10:18,979 --> 01:10:20,540
I don't think so.

1200
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:23,099
<font color="#008000">Is it hers?</font>

1201
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:37,259
So, you took her to the folk club
in November?

1202
01:10:37,299 --> 01:10:38,979
She kept the tickets.

1203
01:10:40,259 --> 01:10:41,700
<font color="yellow">I really liked her.</font>

1204
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:44,339
<font color="yellow">All right, she was my kind of girl.</font>

1205
01:10:45,979 --> 01:10:48,339
<font color="cyan">What kind's that, then? Easy?</font>

1206
01:10:48,379 --> 01:10:51,019
<font color="yellow">See, you're just like the tools</font>
<font color="yellow">I work with.</font>

1207
01:10:51,059 --> 01:10:55,500
<font color="yellow">She wasn't easy or a pushover or any</font>
<font color="yellow">of the other names you'd call her.</font>

1208
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:58,379
Then, why didn't you tell us about
your relationship with her?

1209
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:01,259
<font color="yellow">You've heard them rib me at work</font>
<font color="yellow">over taking Naomi out.</font>

1210
01:11:02,299 --> 01:11:03,979
<font color="yellow">If they'd found out</font>
<font color="yellow">I was seeing a barmaid</font>

1211
01:11:04,019 --> 01:11:05,379
<font color="yellow">that would've been the end of me.</font>

1212
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:06,860
How would they have known?

1213
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:10,860
<font color="yellow">She was a test subject, wasn't she?</font>
<font color="yellow">At the lab.</font>

1214
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:13,580
No latent potential for ESP,
whatsoever.

1215
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:15,460
Well, a complete brick.

1216
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:19,099
<font color="yellow">Don kept her on</font>
<font color="yellow">as a control group.</font>

1217
01:11:19,139 --> 01:11:23,339
<font color="yellow">They thought it was funny,</font>
<font color="yellow">Don and Ferman.</font>

1218
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:26,620
<font color="yellow">They thought they'd have some sport</font>
<font color="yellow">with a thick barmaid.</font>

1219
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:29,660
<font color="yellow">Mind you, she was making</font>
<font color="yellow">30-bob every visit,</font>

1220
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:31,820
<font color="yellow">so who had the last laugh there (?)</font>

1221
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:33,979
<font color="cyan">You were ashamed of her?</font>

1222
01:11:34,019 --> 01:11:34,979
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

1223
01:11:36,019 --> 01:11:37,979
<font color="yellow">I was willing to take her on.</font>

1224
01:11:38,019 --> 01:11:39,860
<font color="cyan">Only you didn't.</font>

1225
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:42,219
<font color="yellow">Yeah, she was still with Carl.</font>

1226
01:11:42,259 --> 01:11:43,740
Then why didn't she just drop him?

1227
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:45,379
<font color="yellow">She was frightened to.</font>

1228
01:11:47,379 --> 01:11:48,740
<font color="yellow">She was afraid of him.</font>

1229
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:51,019
<font color="yellow">And with good reason.</font>

1230
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,420
<font color="yellow">I mean, he got her in the end,</font>
<font color="yellow">didn't he?</font>

1231
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:57,299
<font color="cyan">That what you think?</font>

1232
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:01,580
<font color="yellow">Don't you?</font>

1233
01:12:14,019 --> 01:12:15,460
I didn't tell you, did I?

1234
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,660
The television people
have been in touch.

1235
01:12:19,179 --> 01:12:20,939
<font color="yellow">Which television people?</font>

1236
01:12:22,219 --> 01:12:24,500
About these lecture programmes.

1237
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,379
With what happened
to Dr Benford,

1238
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:29,339
they want me to talk to them
about stepping in to her role.

1239
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:32,500
<font color="yellow">Is that something you want?</font>

1240
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:35,019
<font color="yellow">To be a...</font>
<font color="yellow">Oh, what do you call them,</font>

1241
01:12:35,059 --> 01:12:36,259
<font color="yellow">a television personality?</font>

1242
01:12:36,299 --> 01:12:37,900
No. Not really.

1243
01:12:37,939 --> 01:12:39,259
I can't think of anything worse.

1244
01:12:40,259 --> 01:12:42,700
But they've asked
and you never know.

1245
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:44,540
Might be good for the department.

1246
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:53,379
<font color="yellow">This Dr Benford</font>
<font color="yellow">that the police were here about.</font>

1247
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:54,939
<font color="yellow">Is there any news?</font>

1248
01:12:54,979 --> 01:12:56,099
No.

1249
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:58,860
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

1250
01:13:01,019 --> 01:13:03,139
<font color="yellow">She must have been pretty.</font>

1251
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:05,820
How's that?

1252
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:07,860
<font color="yellow">You never mention the pretty ones.</font>

1253
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:10,139
SCOFFS
What nonsense you do talk.

1254
01:13:10,179 --> 01:13:11,700
<font color="yellow">I'm plain.</font>

1255
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:13,299
<font color="yellow">It must be very dull for you.</font>

1256
01:13:13,339 --> 01:13:16,179
Now, you're just
fishing for compliments.

1257
01:13:16,219 --> 01:13:19,099
If I've not mentioned her,
it's because I barely notice her.

1258
01:13:19,139 --> 01:13:22,139
You know, they are a general
nuisance in the laboratory,

1259
01:13:22,179 --> 01:13:24,460
but beyond that,
they are invisible to me.

1260
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:30,019
Dessert?

1261
01:13:30,979 --> 01:13:32,620
<font color="yellow">Prunes.</font>

1262
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:34,420
Oh, splendid.

1263
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:37,379
<font color="yellow">And cold custard.</font>

1264
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:39,019
Tip-top.

1265
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:22,179
FOOTSTEPS CRUNCH

1266
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:35,179
EERIE WHISTLING

1267
01:14:41,259 --> 01:14:42,939
<font color="cyan">That Miss Tate telephoned.</font>

1268
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:45,700
<font color="cyan">She's had another one of her turns,</font>
<font color="cyan">and wanted to talk to somebody.</font>

1269
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:47,500
I'll give her a call.

1270
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:49,139
<font color="cyan">I don't know if it's connected,</font>

1271
01:14:49,179 --> 01:14:51,620
<font color="cyan">but this was handed over</font>
<font color="cyan">from nights.</font>

1272
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:54,580
<font color="cyan">Woman reported a fella</font>
<font color="cyan">exposing himself to on the towpath.</font>

1273
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:57,420
<font color="cyan">Not 200 yards from where</font>
<font color="cyan">Molly Andrews' body was found.</font>

1274
01:14:57,460 --> 01:15:00,420
<font color="cyan">She says she heard someone whistling</font>
<font color="cyan">just before he jumped out at her.</font>

1275
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:01,700
<font color="cyan">I've got identikit coming in,</font>

1276
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:03,460
<font color="cyan">see if we can't get</font>
<font color="cyan">a description off her.</font>

1277
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:06,979
<font color="cyan">His face, obviously, not the, er...</font>

1278
01:15:07,019 --> 01:15:09,339
<font color="#008000">Last turkey in the shop?</font>

1279
01:15:09,379 --> 01:15:11,820
<font color="cyan">Hanging about the bushes</font>
<font color="cyan">half the night in all weathers</font>

1280
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:14,460
<font color="cyan">on the off-chance of a passer-by</font>
<font color="cyan">to wave your doings at.</font>

1281
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:16,860
<font color="cyan">What do they get out of it?</font>

1282
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:18,500
<font color="cyan">That's what I can never fathom.</font>

1283
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:21,019
<font color="#008000">Great relief to us all,</font>
<font color="#008000">Sergeant, I'm sure (!)</font>

1284
01:15:21,059 --> 01:15:23,860
<font color="#008000">You think that's what's happened</font>
<font color="#008000">at New Year? He goes out flashing,</font>

1285
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:26,420
<font color="#008000">and something's gone wrong</font>
<font color="#008000">between him and Molly Andrews.</font>

1286
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:29,219
I don't think it's about a man
exposing himself on the towpath.

1287
01:15:29,259 --> 01:15:30,620
I think it's about a college type

1288
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:33,219
writing his telephone number
on flashcards for a barmaid.

1289
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,660
Did Dr Benford ever mention
her private life?

1290
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,139
<font color="yellow">Not really.</font>

1291
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:43,740
What about a Dr Kreitsek,
did she ever mention him?

1292
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:47,900
SHE QUIVERS
<font color="yellow">It was here, wasn't it?</font>

1293
01:15:49,179 --> 01:15:52,139
<font color="yellow">Where she died.</font>
<font color="yellow">The girl from New Year.</font>

1294
01:15:55,939 --> 01:15:58,420
When did you start having these,

1295
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:01,019
what would you call them,
intuitions?

1296
01:16:01,059 --> 01:16:03,339
<font color="yellow">Erm, when I was a little girl.</font>

1297
01:16:03,379 --> 01:16:05,500
<font color="yellow">It was just little things.</font>

1298
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:07,379
<font color="yellow">Family things to start with.</font>

1299
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:09,540
<font color="yellow">My aunt had a car accident,</font>

1300
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:11,740
<font color="yellow">and I knew about it</font>
<font color="yellow">before she'd told my mum.</font>

1301
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:12,979
Right.

1302
01:16:15,979 --> 01:16:18,660
<font color="yellow">Sorry, I don't wanna go down there.</font>

1303
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:25,139
The man from here,

1304
01:16:25,179 --> 01:16:27,700
could he have anything to do
with what happened to Dr Benford?

1305
01:16:29,139 --> 01:16:30,860
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

1306
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,660
SHE SIGHS
<font color="yellow">Look, it's like...</font>

1307
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:38,139
<font color="yellow">being a radio that's left on,</font>

1308
01:16:38,179 --> 01:16:40,379
<font color="yellow">that's tuning through</font>
<font color="yellow">the frequencies,</font>

1309
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:42,660
<font color="yellow">trying to find a station.</font>

1310
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:45,139
<font color="yellow">I can't always make sense</font>
<font color="yellow">of what I see until later.</font>

1311
01:16:48,939 --> 01:16:50,620
<font color="yellow">Like with you.</font>

1312
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:52,740
Me?

1313
01:16:53,939 --> 01:16:55,620
Why, what about me?

1314
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:57,780
<font color="yellow">There's a woman...</font>

1315
01:16:58,939 --> 01:17:00,139
<font color="yellow">..in a green dress.</font>

1316
01:17:02,939 --> 01:17:06,620
<font color="yellow">And there's just, er... a sadness.</font>

1317
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:08,979
<font color="yellow">Does that mean anything to you?</font>

1318
01:17:14,299 --> 01:17:18,299
<font color="cyan">Jenny Tate confided to Dr Benford</font>
<font color="cyan">about this vision</font>

1319
01:17:18,339 --> 01:17:21,099
<font color="cyan">or whatever it was,</font>
<font color="cyan">and she, in turn, notified you.</font>

1320
01:17:21,139 --> 01:17:24,059
<font color="cyan">I'm curious as to why you didn't</font>
<font color="cyan">bring this information</font>

1321
01:17:24,099 --> 01:17:25,660
<font color="cyan">to the police?</font>

1322
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:27,500
<font color="#008000">I really didn't think</font>
<font color="#008000">it was my place.</font>

1323
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:30,339
<font color="#008000">We only had Miss Tate's word</font>
<font color="#008000">to go on.</font>

1324
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:32,099
<font color="#008000">This vision did not take place</font>

1325
01:17:32,139 --> 01:17:34,620
<font color="#008000">under laboratory controlled</font>
<font color="#008000">conditions.</font>

1326
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:37,059
<font color="#008000">We'd no way to know</font>
<font color="#008000">if it was genuine.</font>

1327
01:17:37,099 --> 01:17:39,580
Or she was just
doing it for attention.

1328
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:42,580
<font color="#008000">She could have just picked up on</font>
<font color="#008000">something she read in the papers.</font>

1329
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:45,460
<font color="#008000">You know we're not in</font>
<font color="#008000">the vision business. Not like that.</font>

1330
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:49,740
<font color="#008000">Our experiments suggest</font>
<font color="#008000">that paranormal phenomena,</font>

1331
01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:53,700
<font color="#008000">present in far less dramatic</font>
<font color="#008000">a fashion than she described.</font>

1332
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:57,139
You're not treating her claims with
any degree of seriousness, are you?

1333
01:17:57,179 --> 01:17:59,339
<font color="cyan">There are certain</font>
<font color="cyan">details of the crime</font>

1334
01:17:59,379 --> 01:18:01,939
<font color="cyan">known only to ourselves</font>
<font color="cyan">and the perpetrator.</font>

1335
01:18:01,979 --> 01:18:05,740
<font color="cyan">Miss Tate's insight or vision,</font>
<font color="cyan">or whatever you wanna call it,</font>

1336
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:08,339
<font color="cyan">accords with those peculiarities</font>
<font color="cyan">to a degree</font>

1337
01:18:08,379 --> 01:18:11,420
<font color="cyan">which warrants us</font>
<font color="cyan">taking them very seriously indeed.</font>

1338
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:12,860
Oh, and what happened to Naomi?

1339
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:15,580
Did, erm... Miss Tate have
a vision of what happened there?

1340
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:17,259
<font color="#008000">Oh, that's a very good point, Dai.</font>

1341
01:18:17,299 --> 01:18:18,979
<font color="#008000">They were quite close.</font>

1342
01:18:19,019 --> 01:18:22,500
<font color="#008000">If this girl really had</font>
<font color="#008000">half the talent she pretends to,</font>

1343
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:24,939
<font color="#008000">one might imagine</font>
<font color="#008000">she'd have some idea</font>

1344
01:18:24,979 --> 01:18:27,179
<font color="#008000">of who was responsible</font>
<font color="#008000">for Naomi's death.</font>

1345
01:18:27,219 --> 01:18:30,500
<font color="cyan">If she had, Professor, I'd hardly</font>
<font color="cyan">be at liberty to discuss it.</font>

1346
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:33,219
<font color="cyan">Certainly not</font>
<font color="cyan">with any of her colleagues.</font>

1347
01:18:35,059 --> 01:18:36,660
<font color="#008000">Hm.</font>

1348
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:39,500
<font color="yellow">Yeah. Yeah, no.</font>
<font color="yellow">I'll be right over. Thank you.</font>

1349
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:40,860
<font color="yellow">Could you cover for me?</font>

1350
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,460
<font color="cyan">Why? Where you going?</font>

1351
01:18:43,939 --> 01:18:47,620
<font color="#008000">Looks like Dr Kreitsek</font>
<font color="#008000">wasn't lying about Molly Andrews.</font>

1352
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:48,660
<font color="#008000">She's here, all right,</font>

1353
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:50,379
<font color="#008000">with all the rest</font>
<font color="#008000">of the guinea-pigs.</font>

1354
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:53,259
<font color="#008000">Professor Blish signed off</font>
<font color="#008000">her expenses each visit.</font>

1355
01:18:53,299 --> 01:18:55,580
Worth giving Carl another go,
I think.

1356
01:18:55,620 --> 01:18:58,139
<font color="yellow">So, Professor Blish uses</font>
<font color="yellow">a fountain pen?</font>

1357
01:18:58,179 --> 01:19:01,259
Hm? <font color="yellow">You can tell by the signature</font>
<font color="yellow">on the time sheet, look.</font>

1358
01:19:01,299 --> 01:19:03,620
<font color="yellow">The nib has become splayed.</font>

1359
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:06,700
<font color="yellow">That's what's giving it</font>
<font color="yellow">that double-vision look. </font><font color="#008000">So?</font>

1360
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:13,219
<font color="yellow">I thought it was unusual</font>
<font color="yellow">for Dr Benford</font>

1361
01:19:13,259 --> 01:19:15,099
<font color="yellow">to be using a pen like this.</font>

1362
01:19:15,139 --> 01:19:17,099
<font color="yellow">This is Professor Blish's pen.</font>

1363
01:19:18,219 --> 01:19:21,460
But we saw Blish sign a cheque
for the butcher's.

1364
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,820
It was a silver pen, quite modern.

1365
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:26,460
<font color="yellow">But didn't his wife</font>
<font color="yellow">give him a pen with the chequebook?</font>

1366
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:28,460
<font color="#008000">Bloke can have more than one pen.</font>

1367
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:32,019
<font color="yellow">He can, but this pen belonged</font>
<font color="yellow">to Professor Blish.</font>

1368
01:19:33,059 --> 01:19:35,339
<font color="yellow">Look, the lines on the page,</font>

1369
01:19:35,379 --> 01:19:37,979
<font color="yellow">are the exact same</font>
<font color="yellow">as the signature on the timesheets.</font>

1370
01:19:38,019 --> 01:19:40,660
And that's the pen that was found
under Dr Benford's body?

1371
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:43,860
<font color="yellow">Which means it must have landed</font>
<font color="yellow">before she fell.</font>

1372
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:46,660
Why kill Molly Andrews, though?

1373
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:48,299
<font color="#008000">You think he was knocking her off?</font>

1374
01:19:48,339 --> 01:19:50,099
<font color="yellow">Only one way to find out.</font>

1375
01:19:57,219 --> 01:20:02,339
Just one or two formalities
I wanted to go through with you.

1376
01:20:02,379 --> 01:20:05,620
I'm taking care of Dr Benford's
subjects now.

1377
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:07,100
SHE CLEARS THROAT

1378
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:10,860
You spoke to the police, I believe?

1379
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:13,219
<font color="yellow">Er, yes. Yes, I did.</font>

1380
01:20:13,259 --> 01:20:14,900
About Dr Benford?

1381
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:18,579
<font color="yellow">Yes. And I told her about my...</font>

1382
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:21,740
<font color="yellow">Er, what I saw on the towpath.</font>

1383
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:25,780
And did you talk to them about
anything else? Anyone here, say?

1384
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:27,219
<font color="yellow">Like who?</font>

1385
01:20:31,579 --> 01:20:32,700
Well...

1386
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:37,700
..you remember that little
conversation I had with Dr Benford?

1387
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:39,900
You were both laughing.

1388
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:41,219
Do you remember?

1389
01:20:41,259 --> 01:20:43,459
On the staircase.

1390
01:20:43,499 --> 01:20:44,579
WOMEN GIGGLE

1391
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:46,139
Perhaps, I seemed a little funny?

1392
01:20:46,179 --> 01:20:47,780
What's...
'A little cross, maybe?'

1393
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:50,219
..what's funny?
<font color="cyan">Oh, nothing.</font>

1394
01:20:50,259 --> 01:20:51,299
Oh, really.

1395
01:20:51,339 --> 01:20:53,100
It seemed quite funny.

1396
01:20:53,139 --> 01:20:54,620
<font color="cyan">No. No, I assure you.</font>

1397
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:56,539
Do you?

1398
01:20:57,620 --> 01:20:59,740
Well, then, I am assured...

1399
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:01,259
aren't I?

1400
01:21:08,579 --> 01:21:10,900
Did you mention that at all?

1401
01:21:12,259 --> 01:21:13,740
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

1402
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:14,940
No.

1403
01:21:15,940 --> 01:21:17,499
Well, that's good.

1404
01:21:20,179 --> 01:21:21,900
SHE GASPS AND SPLUTTERS,
HE GRUNTS

1405
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:26,459
DOOR OPENS,
VOICE CALLS OUT

1406
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:30,419
<font color="#008000">You're all right.</font>
<font color="#008000">You're all right.</font>

1407
01:21:30,459 --> 01:21:31,940
You OK?

1408
01:21:41,179 --> 01:21:43,020
So, did Molly Andrews
threaten to expose

1409
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:44,940
what was going on between you
to your wife?

1410
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:46,179
Is that why you killed her?

1411
01:21:46,219 --> 01:21:47,700
<font color="yellow">Square.</font>

1412
01:21:47,740 --> 01:21:50,139
She was blackmailing you,
so you strangled her

1413
01:21:50,179 --> 01:21:52,339
the way you tried to strangle
Jenny Tate.

1414
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:55,020
<font color="cyan">What?</font>

1415
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:57,379
<font color="cyan">Molly, I, er...</font>

1416
01:21:57,419 --> 01:21:59,579
<font color="cyan">I don't know what</font>
<font color="cyan">you're talking about.</font>

1417
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:03,459
<font color="cyan">What happened between me and Naomi</font>

1418
01:22:03,499 --> 01:22:05,179
<font color="cyan">was nothing to do</font>
<font color="cyan">with anything else.</font>

1419
01:22:05,219 --> 01:22:07,579
<font color="#008000">No more lies, Professor.</font>

1420
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:09,620
<font color="#008000">You'll never breathe free air again.</font>

1421
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:12,259
<font color="#008000">Why don't you come clean?</font>
<font color="#008000">Get it off your chest.</font>

1422
01:22:12,299 --> 01:22:15,179
<font color="#008000">You must have hated her</font>
<font color="#008000">with a passion.</font>

1423
01:22:16,259 --> 01:22:17,860
<font color="cyan">Hate Naomi?</font>

1424
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:20,060
<font color="cyan">I didn't hate her.</font>

1425
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,219
<font color="cyan">Quite the opposite.</font>

1426
01:22:23,539 --> 01:22:24,980
<font color="cyan">I had feelings for her.</font>

1427
01:22:27,259 --> 01:22:29,620
<font color="cyan">And she gave me reason to believe</font>
<font color="cyan">they were reciprocated.</font>

1428
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:33,139
<font color="cyan">You know, it's...</font>
<font color="cyan">it's little things.</font>

1429
01:22:34,419 --> 01:22:37,660
<font color="cyan">Shy glances held a moment too long.</font>

1430
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:41,100
<font color="#008000">Young woman like that?</font>

1431
01:22:41,139 --> 01:22:43,419
<font color="#008000">What would she want</font>
<font color="#008000">with an old stick like you?</font>

1432
01:22:43,459 --> 01:22:47,660
<font color="#008000">No, you don't know.</font>
<font color="#008000">You've no conception.</font>

1433
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:52,980
<font color="#008000">An older man has experience, wisdom.</font>

1434
01:22:54,339 --> 01:22:56,700
<font color="yellow">Donald, I'm-I'm flattered, but...</font>

1435
01:22:57,940 --> 01:22:59,259
<font color="cyan">I thought...</font>

1436
01:23:01,499 --> 01:23:05,219
<font color="cyan">You gave me reason to believe</font>
<font color="cyan">you felt something for me.</font>

1437
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:09,219
<font color="yellow">I... I gave you no reason.</font>

1438
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:12,700
<font color="cyan">You took my arm.</font>

1439
01:23:14,219 --> 01:23:15,459
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1440
01:23:16,539 --> 01:23:17,980
<font color="cyan">In the common room.</font>

1441
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:20,820
<font color="yellow">Did I?</font>

1442
01:23:24,219 --> 01:23:25,419
HE SIGHS

1443
01:23:26,379 --> 01:23:28,539
<font color="cyan">I suppose you'll</font>
<font color="cyan">put it round the college now.</font>

1444
01:23:28,579 --> 01:23:29,860
<font color="cyan">You can all have a...</font>

1445
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:32,459
<font color="cyan">you can all have</font>
<font color="cyan">a jolly good laugh. Well...</font>

1446
01:23:32,499 --> 01:23:35,539
<font color="cyan">I'm telling you now,</font>
<font color="cyan">I won't be laughed at! I won't.</font>

1447
01:23:35,579 --> 01:23:37,940
<font color="yellow">I know. I wouldn't.</font>

1448
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:40,139
<font color="yellow">I respect you too much</font>
<font color="yellow">to ever laugh.</font>

1449
01:23:41,060 --> 01:23:43,579
<font color="cyan">She had a lovely laugh.</font>

1450
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:45,780
<font color="cyan">That's one of the things</font>
<font color="cyan">that first drew me to her.</font>

1451
01:23:48,459 --> 01:23:51,299
<font color="cyan">But, I mean, when you think</font>
<font color="cyan">about it. It was her fault.</font>

1452
01:23:54,259 --> 01:23:56,700
<font color="cyan">That's what set the whole thing</font>
<font color="cyan">in motion. The end of it.</font>

1453
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:07,459
<font color="yellow">Donald?</font>

1454
01:24:07,499 --> 01:24:09,780
HE SCOFFS
<font color="cyan">I gave you a chance!</font>

1455
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:11,020
<font color="cyan">Here.</font>

1456
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:12,499
<font color="cyan">To make something of yourself.</font>

1457
01:24:12,539 --> 01:24:15,820
<font color="cyan">I give you a chance and...</font>
<font color="cyan">you used me.</font>

1458
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:17,579
<font color="yellow">Used you how?</font>

1459
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:21,660
<font color="cyan">I am infinitely more qualified</font>
<font color="cyan">for that television thing than you.</font>

1460
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:23,940
<font color="cyan">It was me first mentioned</font>
<font color="cyan">your name to them.</font>

1461
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:25,740
<font color="cyan">I thought you might make</font>
<font color="cyan">a good assistant.</font>

1462
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:27,219
<font color="yellow">That's what this is about?</font>

1463
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:31,139
<font color="yellow">Your bruised ego.</font>

1464
01:24:31,179 --> 01:24:33,980
<font color="yellow">A woman beat you to the job,</font>
<font color="yellow">and you can't stand it.</font>

1465
01:24:36,139 --> 01:24:37,219
<font color="yellow">You're pathetic.</font>

1466
01:24:38,419 --> 01:24:39,780
<font color="cyan">Where do you think you're going?!</font>

1467
01:24:41,299 --> 01:24:42,820
<font color="yellow">I'm going home, Donald.</font>

1468
01:24:42,860 --> 01:24:45,020
<font color="cyan">You'll stay here</font>
<font color="cyan">until I'm finished with you!</font>

1469
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:47,179
<font color="cyan">I just want a kiss. Kiss me.</font>

1470
01:24:47,219 --> 01:24:49,139
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Get off me!</font>

1471
01:24:49,179 --> 01:24:51,499
<font color="cyan">I would have changed my life,</font>

1472
01:24:51,539 --> 01:24:52,700
<font color="cyan">burnt all this to the ground.</font>

1473
01:24:52,740 --> 01:24:54,299
<font color="yellow">Please. Please. Please.</font>

1474
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:56,259
SHE SCREAMS,
HE GASPS

1475
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:03,419
<font color="cyan">She could have been something,</font>
<font color="cyan">you know?</font>

1476
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:09,259
<font color="cyan">Really been something.</font>

1477
01:25:09,299 --> 01:25:12,179
She was more than "something",
she was someone.

1478
01:25:12,219 --> 01:25:14,379
<font color="#008000">Is that how it went</font>
<font color="#008000">with Molly Andrews?</font>

1479
01:25:14,419 --> 01:25:15,940
<font color="#008000">You became fixated with her</font>

1480
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:18,419
<font color="#008000">the same way you became</font>
<font color="#008000">fixated on Dr Benford?</font>

1481
01:25:18,459 --> 01:25:20,980
<font color="#008000">Did she reject your unwanted</font>
<font color="#008000">advances in the same way?</font>

1482
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:22,539
<font color="#008000">Is that why you killed her?</font>

1483
01:25:32,179 --> 01:25:33,579
I'm off.

1484
01:25:33,620 --> 01:25:34,940
<font color="#008000">Drink?</font>

1485
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:38,740
Erm... I won't this evening.

1486
01:25:43,259 --> 01:25:44,700
<font color="#008000">You were right, then.</font>

1487
01:25:46,179 --> 01:25:47,379
<font color="#008000">And I was wrong.</font>

1488
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:50,259
<font color="#008000">It wasn't the boyfriend.</font>

1489
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:52,740
MORSE EXHALES

1490
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:54,900
Well, don't feel too bad about it.

1491
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:58,379
Sometimes you can't see
what's staring you in the face.

1492
01:25:58,419 --> 01:26:00,660
We got there in the end.

1493
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:01,820
That's the main thing.

1494
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:04,060
See you tomorrow.

1495
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:12,780
CHATTER

1496
01:26:16,179 --> 01:26:17,660
You made it!
MORSE LAUGHS

1497
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:19,499
How's the case.
Did you get your man?

1498
01:26:19,539 --> 01:26:20,780
<font color="yellow">Yeah, it looks that way.</font>

1499
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:22,139
Congratulations.

1500
01:26:22,179 --> 01:26:24,980
<font color="yellow">Hmm. Thank you.</font>
<font color="yellow">I say, this is quite the place.</font>

1501
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:28,259
Let me get you a top up.

1502
01:26:28,299 --> 01:26:30,100
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>
Well, make yourself at home.

1503
01:26:30,139 --> 01:26:31,620
Enjoy the garden. Relax.

1504
01:26:31,660 --> 01:26:33,459
I'll find you and you can
tell me all about it.

1505
01:26:43,419 --> 01:26:47,419
<font color="cyan">My wife's been having</font>
<font color="cyan">these people round.</font>

1506
01:26:47,459 --> 01:26:49,900
<font color="cyan">Faith healers,</font>
<font color="cyan">they call themselves.</font>

1507
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:54,379
<font color="cyan">They perform this laying on</font>
<font color="cyan">of hands, they call it.</font>

1508
01:26:54,419 --> 01:26:56,660
<font color="cyan">Touching her body</font>
<font color="cyan">while prayers are said.</font>

1509
01:26:57,740 --> 01:27:01,940
<font color="cyan">She says it won't work unless...</font>
<font color="cyan">one believes.</font>

1510
01:27:04,499 --> 01:27:05,579
<font color="cyan">Do you believe?</font>

1511
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:09,499
<font color="#008000">Well, can't say I've ever had much</font>
<font color="#008000">use for it in civilian life</font>

1512
01:27:09,539 --> 01:27:11,459
<font color="#008000">outside of court, of course.</font>

1513
01:27:11,499 --> 01:27:13,459
<font color="#008000">We weren't Bible raised.</font>

1514
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:16,740
<font color="cyan">Can it work, do you think?</font>

1515
01:27:18,499 --> 01:27:19,820
<font color="#008000">Beyond me, sir.</font>

1516
01:27:21,179 --> 01:27:25,459
<font color="#008000">For some people,</font>
<font color="#008000">believing's enough.</font>

1517
01:27:25,499 --> 01:27:28,900
<font color="#008000">What they say,</font>
<font color="#008000">"Faith can move mountains"?</font>

1518
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:31,499
<font color="#008000">If it gives her comfort.</font>

1519
01:27:31,539 --> 01:27:32,860
<font color="cyan">Yes. Yes, that's...</font>

1520
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:36,660
<font color="cyan">..that's the important thing.</font>
<font color="cyan">Comfort. Hope.</font>

1521
01:27:39,579 --> 01:27:41,700
<font color="cyan">But I worry, do you see?</font>

1522
01:27:41,740 --> 01:27:46,179
<font color="cyan">What if there is a chance</font>
<font color="cyan">it can work and my want of faith...?</font>

1523
01:28:23,339 --> 01:28:24,620
Morse!

1524
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:26,539
Come and meet my wife.

1525
01:28:36,259 --> 01:28:37,499
HEAVY BREATHING

1526
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:51,780
BLADE SCRAPES, SLICES

1527
01:28:54,259 --> 01:28:55,860
THUD

1528

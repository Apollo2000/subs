they might be ex-military.

would support that theory.

Looking for this?

640
00:30:34,862 --> 00:30:36,596
Why Nuzo?

641
00:30:36,631 --> 00:30:38,465
We told him he didn't have to die.

642
00:30:38,499 --> 00:30:40,033
But he was a stubborn son of a bitch.

GERARD: He held out a long time.

644
00:30:41,986 --> 00:30:43,537

asking questions about us
and why we're here.

I'll take that as a yes.

653
00:31:12,967 --> 00:31:16,033
Nuzo left me coordinates to
a spot 6 miles offshore.

caught 'em doing other things.

But not before they managed

730
00:35:05,889 --> 00:35:07,756
to get their gold on a boat to Hawaii.

731

Yeah, only it sinks, which for them

actually turned out to be a good thing.

Those guys do a stretch in

There's just one problem.

- What's that?
- TANAKA: The gold's gone.

742
00:35:28,736 --> 00:35:31,046
- What do you mean "gone"?
- TANAKA: Gone,

743
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,048
as in there's nothing
on that wreck except barnacles.

744
00:35:33,082 --> 00:35:34,817
Those guys must have
followed us out there.

745
00:35:34,851 --> 00:35:36,785
We were the only ones
with the coordinates.

746
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,286
That's why they didn't kill me
when they had their chance.

guys is with a time machine.

No.

This is a favor.

That is the worst apology
I have ever heard.

759

If you know I'm former MI6,

then you also know that I was disavowed.

I'm pretty sure the guys
that are on that boat

are the same guys that killed Nuzo.

They're leaving with the gold.
Can you track it?

They're headed north.
The Keyhole's positioned

Actually, I'd like to ask.

I'm working on it.

- Right now, I'm open to suggestions.

Mine includes not destroying another
one of Mr. Masters' Ferraris.

That's not a plan.

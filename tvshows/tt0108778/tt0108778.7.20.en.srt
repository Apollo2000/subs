{148}{259}Out of all of us, who do you think|will get married next ?
{292}{357}Probably Monica and Chandler.
{407}{473}Could I have a pack of Newport Lights ?
{475}{574}We don't sell cigarettes,|but they do across the street.
{574}{641}That'd be great. Thanks.
{680}{782}Melissa Worbert. I don't think|I have the energy for this.
{810}{900}Oh, my God ! Ray-Ray Greene ?
{944}{989}What's up ? !
{1011}{1091}You've been MIA|for seven sorority newsletters.
{1092}{1152}What's up with you ?
{1153}{1217}Why don't I tell you over here ?
{1236}{1347}So last I heard|you were gonna get married.
{1352}{1393}Poor Ray-Ray.
{1407}{1462}Oh, no. It's all good.
{1464}{1537}- I actually work at Ralph Lauren.|- Shut up !
{1538}{1640}I will not. I'm the divisional head|of men's sportswear.
{1640}{1731}Shut up more !|Are you friends with Ralph ?
{1732}{1795}- Oh, please.|- Are you ?
{1800}{1834}No.
{1850}{1940}We have to have dinner.|What are you doing tomorrow ?
{1940}{2033}- Tomorrow. I don't know.|- You're having dinner with me.
{2048}{2089}Shut up.
{2092}{2175}I've gotta go.|This has been so great.
{2176}{2268}Oh, there you are.|[UNCUT] You're a bad man for giving me these.
{2269}{2360}- So listen, just call me. Here's my card.|- Oh, wow, thanks.
{2361}{2447}- You're in real estate ?|- No, that's an old card.
{2448}{2503}I got out of that to do something...
{2505}{2603}...where I could help people|and make a difference.
{2603}{2644}What do you do now ?
{2652}{2698}I'm a party planner.
{2712}{2785}- I'll see you tomorrow.|- Okay.
{2807}{2886}Look who's back. It's Ray-Ray.
{2908}{2984}That was my friend, Melissa,|from college.
{2985}{3057}She seems really, really fun !
{3073}{3163}She's actually sweet,|and we used to be very close.
{3164}{3275}Wait a minute.|She's not the one who you... ?
{3276}{3341}Who you what ? Who you what ?
{3365}{3416}- Yes.|- Wow !
{3418}{3480}Wow, what ? Who you what ?
{3482}{3540}Oh, it's not a big deal.
{3541}{3572}They were lovers.
{3575}{3618}- What ?|- What ?
{3620}{3668}No, we weren't. It was nothing.
{3670}{3763}It was one night, senior year,|and we went to a party...
{3764}{3885}...had a lot of sangria,|and you know, ended up...
{3885}{3920}...kissing for a bit.
{3922}{3980}So that's two of my wives.
{4024}{4052}[UNCUT] Where are you going ?
{4055}{4127}[UNCUT] To bring her back here !|[UNCUT] Ross, get the sangria !
{4166}{4220}The One With Rachel's Big Kiss
{5104}{5195}So this is where the band is.|And here's the bar.
{5196}{5314}And all these pins have people's names|on them. Rach, here you are.
{5347}{5438}Why don't we just put me|with a Manhattan in my hand...
{5439}{5514}...talking to the cute bartender.
{5583}{5652}These pins aren't for playing,|are they ?
{5664}{5734}The red are my guests,|and the blue are yours.
{5736}{5810}This is so sad.|I only have like 10 pins.
{5811}{5884}Chandler, relax. It's not a contest.
{5885}{5937}Certainly not a close one.
{6104}{6144}Hey, Rach.
{6193}{6249}Stop picturing it !
{6309}{6428}I think that's it. The seating chart|is done. This is our wedding.
{6428}{6498}They all look like they're having fun|don't they ?
{6503}{6571}So where are my parents gonna be ?
{6576}{6660}Well, if this is the wedding hall...
{6660}{6756}...then your parents would be over here|at home in Queens.
{6756}{6861}They're not invited ?|Oh, no, they're gonna be crushed !
{6861}{6924}Why would they think they're invited ?
{6930}{6989}You got me. I don't...
{6991}{7072}- Joey !|- Look, I thought parents were coming.
{7073}{7151}Your parents are coming.|Chandler's are coming.
{7152}{7212}Ross' parents are coming.
{7225}{7301}Ross' parents are my parents.
{7312}{7375}Well, see, parents are coming.
{7388}{7481}- We should invite them.|- You just want more blue pins.
{7481}{7519}Well, this is just sad.
{7563}{7679}All right. Maybe I can fit them in|if I just do some rearranging.
{7680}{7741}Rachel may have to sit at the bar.
{7743}{7795}That is not a problem.
{7821}{7915}- Maybe you'll order a little sangria.|- Get out of here !
{8004}{8119}These are our tuxedos. If you like|anything, we can make a deal.
{8119}{8236}Anything at all. But these are|the three that Monica pre-approved.
{8255}{8311}Thanks a lot for hooking me up.
{8312}{8428}And I want you to know that I want|you to attend our wedding as my guest.
{8482}{8556}I'm Monica's maid of honor.
{8557}{8607}Okay, don't try to blue-pin me.
{8654}{8730}- Well, these look nice.|- They are nice.
{8731}{8846}When celebrities are done with them,|they send them back.
{8852}{8918}- You mean like for award shows ?|- Some of them.
{8920}{8994}They've been down the red carpet|with people yelling :
{8996}{9054}"Who are you wearing ?|You look fabulous !"
{9088}{9168}Might I suggest watching|a little more ESPN...
{9169}{9223}...and a little less E !
{9256}{9310}Okay. Who wore those ?
{9332}{9431}- Well, this one's Tom Brokaw.|- Not bad.
{9432}{9489}This one is Paul O'Neill.
{9515}{9554}Who's that ?
{9577}{9675}He plays for the Yankees.|Seriously, ESPN.
{9684}{9759}Just once in a while.|Have it on in the background.
{9827}{9913}- This one was Pierce Brosnan.|- Pierce Brosnan ?
{9913}{9943}Are you serious ?
{9946}{9973}007 ?
{9976}{10109}This is James Bond's tux ? I have to|get married in James Bond's tux.
{10119}{10150}It's a pretty cool tux.
{10153}{10252}It's not just that. I would be|England's most powerful weapon.
{10269}{10369}A jet-setting heartbreaker|on Her Majesty's secret service.
{10377}{10465}A man who fears no one,|with a license to kill.
{10513}{10563}Would Monica let me wear this ?
{10683}{10749}We should really learn|how to play the real way.
{10764}{10817}I like our way.
{10847}{10884}Chess !
{10951}{10997}- Nice move.|- Yeah.
{11068}{11169}I hooked Ross and Chandler up|with tuxedos. Do you need one ?
{11169}{11224}No, I'm not wearing a tux.
{11226}{11321}- What are you gonna wear ?|- Multi-colored robes.
{11322}{11369}And maybe a hat.
{11372}{11427}- Does Monica know about this ?|- No.
{11429}{11485}Can I please be there|when you tell her ?
{11547}{11609}You want to go to a movie tonight ?
{11610}{11668}I'm having dinner with Melissa.
{11669}{11698}Can I come ?
{11740}{11818}I won't talk.|You'll just hear my video camera.
{11825}{11893}- What ? What's going on ?|- Can I tell her ?
{11894}{11963}Do you want what happened,|or Joey's lewd version ?
{11964}{12016}- Joey's.|- Okay.
{12054}{12094}I had this college friend...
{12096}{12198}...and I made the mistake|of telling Joey that one time...
{12198}{12287}...she and I, you know,|kissed a little bit.
{12309}{12367}Yeah, I'm sure that happened.
{12393}{12469}- It did.|- Sure.
{12517}{12577}Hey. It happened.
{12623}{12725}It was senior year.|It was after the Sigma Chi luau...
{12726}{12786}...and Melissa and I got very drunk.
{12788}{12849}And we ended up kissing.
{12850}{12885}For several minutes.
{12888}{12985}Which means she had a couple spritzers|and a peck on the cheek.
{13008}{13076}Why are you taking this away from me ?
{13089}{13148}Why is it so hard for you to believe ?
{13150}{13256}Okay. I just didn't know|that you were a lesbian.
{13395}{13524}I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian.|I'm just saying that this happened.
{13529}{13638}It just seems pretty wild.|And you're so...
{13638}{13662}...vanilla.
{13692}{13816}Vanilla ? I'm not vanilla.|I do lots of crazy things.
{13817}{13899}I mean, I got drunk|and married in Vegas.
{13900}{13933}To Ross.
{13967}{14012}If you don't believe me...
{14014}{14113}...just come with me to dinner tonight|and she'll tell you.
{14113}{14174}Okay. Because I can't picture it.
{14176}{14241}You should get inside my head.
{14363}{14429}Guess what I got for your wedding ?
{14430}{14494}A freakishly thin date|with a hanger for a head ?
{14524}{14620}Rachel hooked me up with a tux.|But not just any tux.
{14623}{14667}Batman's tux !
{14681}{14716}- What ?|- That's right.
{14719}{14844}Made expressly for Val Kilmer,|and worn by him in the hit film...
{14844}{14906}...that Batman film he was in.
{14917}{14976}You can't wear that.|I'm wearing the famous tux.
{14977}{15019}- James Bond's tux !|- So ?
{15021}{15115}So ? If you wear that,|it'll make mine less special.
{15115}{15176}You need something|to make this day special ?
{15177}{15242}Hello ! You have|the most special thing of all.
{15244}{15329}You are marrying the woman you love.
{15429}{15504}Don't take away my cool thing.|Pretty please ?
{15505}{15607}"Pretty please ?" Not very 007.
{15614}{15712}If you were getting married,|I'd never do anything to upset you.
{15713}{15827}- You slept with my sister.|- That was pretty 007.
{15927}{15999}Okay, good, you're here.|All right, I figured it out.
{16000}{16070}I'm gonna take 2 tables of 8,|add your parents...
{16072}{16130}...and make them into 3 tables of 6.
{16132}{16208}And I called the caterer.|We are good to go !
{16213}{16261}Yeah. They're not coming.
{16311}{16336}What ?
{16339}{16432}They think that you only|invited them because of me.
{16432}{16469}They feel unwanted.
{16472}{16572}That's too bad.|It's true. But too bad.
{16572}{16633}If you could just call my mom.
{16635}{16707}Just let her know|you want them there.
{16708}{16794}This is a woman|who has sent you many lasagnas.
{16794}{16820}No, she hasn't.
{16823}{16894}Is it her fault|if some didn't make it to you ?
{16903}{16936}What am I gonna say ?
{16939}{17056}Tell them you mixed up invitations.|No, blame it on the post office.
{17057}{17149}They hate the post office.|And the Irish.
{17154}{17223}But I don't think|you could blame it on them.
{17284}{17405}Hello ? Yeah, hi. Mrs. Tribbiani ?|This is Monica Geller.
{17406}{17523}I'm just calling to say that we really|hope you can make it to the wedding.
{17524}{17623}Apparently some of our invitations|weren't delivered.
{17623}{17710}I guess there was some screw-up|at the damn post office.
{17759}{17801}Tell me about it !
{17804}{17932}Yeah, the U.S. Post Office ?|No. More like U.S. Lost Office.
{17940}{18003}What are they, Irish ?
{18143}{18269}Anyway, his name's Allen. And we've|been going out for three years.
{18270}{18335}He was my first client|when I became a party planner.
{18343}{18451}He was actually planning a party|for his girlfriend at the time.
{18452}{18476}Oh, well.
{18516}{18627}- He was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.|- That's great.
{18656}{18724}- Were you ever in a sorority ?|- Of course.
{18725}{18813}Yes. I was a Thigh Mega Tampon.
{18880}{18905}What one ?
{18908}{18997}We were huge too.|But they had to shut us down...
{18997}{19087}...when Regina Phalangie|died of alcohol poisoning.
{19088}{19192}Isn't it a shame when one girl|ruins it for the whole bunch ?
{19280}{19314}Anyway...
{19323}{19402}Speaking of drinking too much,|I told Phoebe...
{19403}{19519}...about that crazy night after the|Sigma Chi luau where we made out.
{19537}{19562}What ?
{19565}{19700}Remember we... Come on, we had sarongs|on and the coconut bikini tops.
{19700}{19782}We went back to the house|and got really silly...
{19783}{19816}...and we made out.
{19836}{19953}Wow, Ray-Ray, I have no idea|what you're talking about.
{19954}{19995}Really ?
{20136}{20192}Ross is Batman.
{20240}{20352}Well, he did manage to keep|his identity secret for a long time.
{20353}{20464}Rachel got Ross the tuxedo|that Val Kilmer wore in Batman.
{20465}{20532}Batman is so much cooler|than James Bond.
{20533}{20657}- What ? 007 has all those gadgets.|- Batman has a utility belt.
{20658}{20759}- 007 has a fancy car.|- Batman has the Batmobile.
{20800}{20936}- 007 gets all the ladies.|- Batman has Robin.
{21040}{21093}We get ESPN, right ?
{21160}{21289}How about you go put on your 007|tuxedo, and I'll make you a martini ?
{21290}{21337}I don't like martinis.
{21339}{21415}- A Yoo-hoo with a funny straw ?|- Yum.
{21500}{21562}I know the invitation says 6 p.m.
{21564}{21663}But does that mean get there at 6,|or the show starts at 6 ?
{21663}{21700}"The show" ?
{21748}{21837}Right, the wedding. Gotcha.
{21838}{21918}But weddings start|a little late, right ?
{21924}{21988}Have you ever been|to one of my weddings ?
{22010}{22096}Well, it's the same day|as my niece's christening...
{22096}{22156}...and I want my parents to see me.
{22157}{22256}My part's in the beginning. I'm not|in the rest of the show... Wedding.
{22272}{22322}The wedding starts at 6.
{22324}{22386}Okay. I totally hear you.
{22388}{22458}How about this ?|I vamp till they get there.
{22479}{22508}You'll "vamp" ?
{22511}{22588}Like warm up the crowd.|Ask where they're from.
{22589}{22693}Because in Joey Tribbiani,|you get a minister and an entertainer.
{22694}{22762}I'm a "ministainer." All right ?
{22780}{22856}There's no one better.|There's no one greater.
{22905}{22982}[UNCUT] Oh, please, God. Don't vamp.
{22997}{23055}[UNCUT] Okay, maybe I'll talk to Chandler.
{23056}{23146}[UNCUT] And maybe he'd like to get married|at 007 o'clock.
{23176}{23265}[UNCUT] All right. I will give you|10 extra minutes. That is it.
{23265}{23315}[UNCUT] That's great ! Thank you so much.
{23317}{23405}[UNCUT] Well, we're in luck. The tux fits perfectly.
{23504}{23580}[UNCUT] Chandler, that jacket,|it's way too big.
{23581}{23675}[UNCUT] Oh, that's okay.|[UNCUT] The pants are way too small.
{23772}{23835}[UNCUT] I'm sorry, sweetie.|[UNCUT] You cannot wear that.
{23843}{23911}[UNCUT] Now this means Ross is gonna be|the only cool one.
{23912}{23983}[UNCUT] Something, by the way,|I never thought I would say.
{23996}{24076}[UNCUT] Dude, take that thing off.|[UNCUT] You look like a fool.
{24082}{24189}[UNCUT] Come next door. I got some minister|headdresses I want you to see.
{24248}{24311}How can you not remember us kissing ?
{24313}{24429}I don't know. I don't remember|a lot of things that never happened.
{24448}{24564}Remember, we were on the sleeping porch ?|We couldn't stop giggling.
{24564}{24626}Our coconuts kept knocking together.
{24628}{24711}Somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
{24728}{24788}I don't want|to make you uncomfortable...
{24789}{24875}...but I told Phoebe it happened,|and she doesn't believe me.
{24903}{25022}I'm sorry. I mean, if I thought|it happened, I would say it.
{25023}{25107}Maybe I passed out and you did stuff|to me while I was sleeping.
{25108}{25142}No !
{25151}{25201}- All right.|- Okay, fine.
{25205}{25315}You don't have to admit it|because I know that it happened.
{25324}{25348}Okay !
{25352}{25433}You have to admit it !|We kissed ! Say it !
{25440}{25518}It's okay, you don't have to do this.|I believe you.
{25519}{25614}If you say you kissed Melissa,|then you kissed Melissa.
{25620}{25684}- Thank you, Phoebe.|- Okay.
{25691}{25734}- But she didn't.|- I know.
{25854}{25887}You carry that around ?
{25897}{25996}Yes. I find it to be|something of a conversation piece.
{26017}{26095}- Between you and... ?|- Gunther.
{26116}{26153}Why don't we put them on ?
{26156}{26233}Get a picture of Batman|and James Bond, together.
{26234}{26296}I would,|but my pants are a little tight.
{26298}{26423}A little tight ?|I could see 00 and 7 in those things.
{26424}{26452}Well, that stinks.
{26455}{26538}I was looking forward to wearing|our celebrity tuxes together.
{26539}{26642}- So you're not gonna be wearing yours ?|- Are you kidding ? It's Batman's tux !
{26686}{26716}Let me try it on.
{26744}{26846}Okay. But just the jacket.|00 and 7 are not getting in there.
{26992}{27054}Holy double-vented comfort, Batman !
{27119}{27152}What's this ?
{27156}{27226}An invitation to|the At First Sight premiere ?
{27228}{27302}Val Kilmer didn't|wear this in Batman.
{27304}{27428}He wore it to the premiere of a fruity|love story where he was a blind guy.
{27430}{27475}Let me see that.
{27508}{27545}Oh, man.
{27548}{27673}The only super power you have is the|slightly heightened sense of smell.
{27704}{27766}Can I talk to you guys for a second ?
{27768}{27843}I give up.|Whatever you want, you can have it.
{27845}{27901}You want to sing a song or do a dance ?
{27904}{28032}You want your mom at the altar|screaming racial slurs ? I don't care.
{28032}{28143}I just want to thank you guys|for what you did for my parents.
{28144}{28232}They're so happy|to be a part of your special day.
{28251}{28309}Tell them we're glad they're coming.
{28312}{28443}I will. Oh, check out what they got|me to wear for the ceremony !
{28517}{28612}I wear it like this when I|marry you guys. And then this...
{28615}{28676}...is for party time.
{28819}{28911}It happened.|I am telling you it happened.
{28912}{28958}It was great meeting you.
{28963}{29063}And, Rachel ? I don't think|I'll be calling you because...
{29064}{29126}...you know, you've gotten weird.
{29161}{29200}Take care, you guys.
{29204}{29264}Wait a minute. Okay, look.
{29268}{29373}That night was the one wild thing|I've ever done in my life.
{29374}{29426}I won't let you take it away.
{29428}{29540}So if you don't remember that,|maybe you'll remember this...
{29687}{29800}Oh, my God. You love me.
{29818}{29843}What ?
{29847}{29943}Of course I remember.|I think about it all the time.

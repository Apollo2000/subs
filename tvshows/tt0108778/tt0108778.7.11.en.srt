1
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:08,138
You have got to try this cheesecake.

2
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:11,105
You know, I'm not that much
of a sweet tooth..

3
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:14,640
Oh, my God, it's so creamy!

4
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:18,014
That's the best
cheesecake I've ever had!

5
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,945
Where did you get this?

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,454
It was at the front door when I got
home. Somebody sent it to us.

7
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,187
This isn't addressed to you.

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,691
This is addressed
to Mrs. Braverman downstairs!

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,397
Thief!

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,766
I didn't read the box
before I opened it...

11
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:38,630
and you can't return a box
after you opened it!

12
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:41,966
-Why not?
-Because it's too delicious!

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,201
You stole this cheesecake.
That's wrong.

14
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:51,041
No, it'll be okay because Mrs. Braverman
will send for a free one.

15
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:53,013
That way, we all win.

16
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,178
The only losers are the
big cheesecake conglomerate...

17
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,924
"Mama's Little Bakery."

18
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:02,519
I feel terrible.

19
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,230
I'm a horrible, horrible person.

20
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,227
I'm sorry, what?

21
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:12,166
The One With All The Cheesecakes

22
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,267
I should get going. Big day at work.

23
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,640
You know how I'm in a coma?

24
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,745
Today they do a test on me and it
turns out I'm not brain-dead.

25
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,845
So..

26
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,646
Mr. Smarty Pants.

27
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:05,256
It's just my character
that's not brain-dead.

28
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,157
Phoebe, still on for tonight?

29
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,658
-Absolutely.
-I'll see you at 8.

30
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,456
What's at 8?

31
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:17,568
Dinner. We get together about once
a month to discuss the rest of you.

32
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:21,002
Wow! Did not know that.

33
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,766
May I say how lovely you look today?

34
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,034
Duly noted.

35
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:30,612
zSo for tomorrow, do you want to
rent a car and drive down together?

36
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:34,409
-What are you talking about?
-Cousin Frannie's wedding.

37
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:37,849
You were invited?

38
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,550
No.

39
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,058
Oh, my God, I can't believe this.

40
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,763
I thought only Mom and Dad
were invited.

41
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:50,129
From the ages of 7 to 9,
Frannie and I were inseparable.

42
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,170
Maybe since the age of 9,
Frannie's made some new friends.

43
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,875
It's probably just a mistake.
Let me call Aunt Cheryl.

44
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:02,512
Maybe you are invited and the
invitation got lost in the mail.

45
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:05,775
You call her and tell her
that when we were kids...

46
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:09,284
her precious Frannie
tried to undress me several times.

47
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:13,014
If I hadn't stopped her, there
wouldn't be a wedding to go to.

48
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,956
She tried to undress me too.

49
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:19,258
I used to undress my cousin Glenn.

50
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:30,532
Joseph Francis Tribbiani,
are you home yet?

51
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,001
I think he's still out.
What's wrong?

52
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,612
I'll tell you, Rachel Karen Greene.

53
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,840
I had plans with Joey,
and he left me this note.

54
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:42,553
"Phoebe, can't make it.
Got a date. Talk to you later.

55
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:44,416
Big Daddy."

56
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,417
-"Big Daddy"?
-That's a nickname we were trying.

57
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:52,995
You know what nickname
never caught on? "The Ross-a-tron."

58
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,694
Here's Joseph Francis!

59
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:02,169
Wait, what are you
middle-naming me for?

60
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:03,842
I left you a note.

61
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,375
That doesn't give you the
right to ditch me!

62
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:10,548
You can cancel plans with friends
if there's a possibility for sex.

63
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,717
He's right. That is the rule.

64
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:16,752
I don't accept it. When we make
plans, I expect you to show up.

65
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:20,187
I'm not a way to kill time
till you meet someone better.

66
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:25,056
Boyfriends and girlfriends will
come and go, but this is for life.

67
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:29,358
I'm so sorry. I had no idea
it would bother you this much.

68
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,933
Well, it does.

69
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,297
Well, can I make it up to you?

70
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:34,801
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:38,976
How about dinner tomorrow night?
I'll pay for myself.

72
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,245
Okay, you wore me down.

73
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:49,282
While you're over there, how
about a beer for "The Ross-a-tron"?

74
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,490
"Ross.." Is that back?

75
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:00,062
The other cheesecake came.

76
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,700
They delivered it here again.

77
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,401
Just bring it downstairs.
What's the problem?

78
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,597
I can't seem to say goodbye.

79
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,138
Are you serious?

80
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:13,608
We ate an entire cake
two days ago and you want more?

81
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,474
Well, I've forgotten
what it tastes like.

82
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,616
It was cheesecake. It was fine.

83
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:23,720
It had a buttery, crumbly,
graham cracker crust...

84
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:26,756
with a very rich...

85
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,827
yet light cream cheese filling.

86
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,532
Wow, my whole mouth
just filled with saliva.

87
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,232
Know what? Forget it.
We're just hungry.

88
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,930
We haven't had lunch.
We're just lightheaded.

89
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,667
So let's go have lunch
and forget about the cheesecake.

90
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:48,311
We'll drop it off
so we're not tempted.

91
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,779
-Where do you want to eat?
-Mama's Little Bakery, Chicago.

92
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:59,481
Mei Torme died.

93
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,319
Joey, that paper's like a year old.

94
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:06,020
Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale
is over?

95
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:12,133
So, I finally heard back
from Aunt Cheryl...

96
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,897
and apparently it wasn't a mistake.

97
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,903
There's limited seating..

98
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:21,875
Limited seating? I am just
one tiny person!

99
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,706
Yeah, but she doesn't know that.

100
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:27,509
I mean, the last time she saw you...

101
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:31,814
you'd have turned one of those
little wedding chairs into kindling.

102
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,321
"Limited seating."
That's such a lame excuse.

103
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,089
That's not the reason
she's not inviting me.

104
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:43,165
What's the big deal? I wasn't invited
to the ceremony, just the reception.

105
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:47,806
If it makes you feel any better, Joan
and I will just make an appearance...

106
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,339
and then we'll leave early
as a sign of protest.

107
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,910
-Joan?
-Yeah, my date.

108
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:58,174
Assistant professor in linguistics.
Tall, very beautiful.

109
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:02,752
And despite what some people say,
not broad-backed.

110
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,953
Wait a minute.
You got "Ross Geller and Guest"?

111
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:09,421
I wasn't invited,
and you got "and Guest"?

112
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,757
Excuse me, I do have to interrupt
on Ross' behalf.

113
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,932
I think the rule applies here.

114
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,364
Since he has a chance
to get on broad-back..

115
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,900
Not broad-back!

116
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,908
Wait a minute. You're bringing me.

117
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,700
I can't cancel on Joan.

118
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,935
-Why not?
-Did you not hear me?

119
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:30,980
She's an assistant professor
in the linguistics department.

120
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,218
They're wild.

121
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:37,151
-Why do you want to come anyway?
-Because...

122
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:38,947
she's my cousin.

123
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,989
I mean, we grew up together.

124
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:46,061
Family, you know?
And all that's important to me.

125
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,257
Okay, all right. I'll take you.

126
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,231
I'll go call Joan.

127
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,065
Oh, that's nice.

128
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,070
Family should be there.

129
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,470
It's her wedding.
Happiest day of her life.

130
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,405
We'll see.

131
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:07,284
Well, thank you for lunch.

132
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,488
Wait, I thought you paid.

133
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,419
Apparently, we don't pay
for food anymore.

134
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:18,022
-Do you see what I see?
-It's still there.

135
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,396
Mrs. Braverman must be out.

136
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:28,173
She could be out of town.
Maybe gone for months.

137
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:32,002
By then, it may spoil.
She can't come back to bad cheesecake.

138
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,145
-It could kill her.
-Don't want that.

139
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:35,539
We're protecting her.

140
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,009
-We'll take it.
-But quick.

141
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,148
-Why?
-I hear her in there.

142
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,784
Go! Go! Go!

143
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,656
Oh, my God, that's David.

144
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,827
-Who?
-David, the scientist guy.

145
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,030
David that I was in love with.

146
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,791
Who went to Russia
and broke my heart, David.

147
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,059
Oh, my God!

148
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,633
Say their name enough,
they turn around.

149
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,034
Phoebe.

150
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,242
David.

151
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:09,872
What are you doing?
Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?

152
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,879
I'm just in town for a conference.

153
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,679
God, you look phenomenal.

154
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,354
Well...

155
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,819
Yeah.

156
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,393
You look great too.
Did you get a haircut?

157
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,187
Yeah. Well, I got like 30 of them.

158
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,161
Look, I got a confession to make.

159
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,666
I was hoping to run into you here.

160
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:35,671
I didn't know if I should call.
I was only in town a few days...

161
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,343
and I didn't want to intrude
on your life.

162
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,409
I really wanted to see you...

163
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,581
but I didn't know
if you wanted to see me.

164
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,911
Of course I would want to see you.
I think about you all the time.

165
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:52,090
Really? Because I think about you
all the time.

166
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:56,385
There's a statue in Minsk
that reminds me of you so much.

167
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,859
It's actually of Lenin...

168
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:02,296
but, you know, at certain angles...

169
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,730
Anyway, do you want
to have dinner tonight?

170
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,302
Yes.

171
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,234
Oh, no!

172
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,733
-What?
-I can't.

173
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:15,242
I can't believe I have plans.
Can you do it tomorrow?

174
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:20,044
No, I have to go in a few hours.
I have to be on the redeye.

175
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,947
Listen, next time you're in Minsk...

176
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,520
Phoebe? Can I talk to you
for a second?

177
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,226
What are you doing?

178
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,928
I have plans with Joey.

179
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,720
So? He'll understand.

180
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,627
No, he won't.
And that's not even the point.

181
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:39,965
I made a whole speech about how
you do not cancel plans with friends.

182
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,937
And now just because, potentially,
the love of my life...

183
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,440
returns from Russia
for one night...

184
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,477
I should change my beliefs?

185
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,774
I should change my beliefs!

186
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:56,947
No. If I don't have my principles,
I don't have anything.

187
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,316
You're so strong.

188
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:02,584
Or I should rush through dinner
with Joey and meet David at 9.

189
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,199
Oh, my God, that is so good!

190
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:15,907
I'm full. And yet I know
if I stop eating this...

191
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,767
I'll regret it.

192
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,546
Hey, what have you got there?

193
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,179
Oh, it's...

194
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,680
It's tofu cake. Want some?

195
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,720
What are you doing tonight?

196
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,218
Dude. Dude.

197
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,861
Sorry.

198
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,757
I got plans with Phoebe.

199
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:41,865
Really? Monica said
she had a date at 9.

200
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,730
-What? Tonight?
-That's what Monica said.

201
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,600
After that speech, she makes a date on
the same night she has plans with me?

202
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,539
She's trying to pull a fast one
on Big Daddy.

203
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,042
Here, I think this is us.

204
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,816
Limited seating, my ass.

205
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,117
Let's see who made the cut.

206
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,294
Hi. I'm Monica Geller.

207
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,953
-How do you know the bride and groom?
-I worked with Frannie.

208
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,497
Used to work with her. Used to.

209
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:18,032
I'm a relative
and I didn't get invited.

210
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,670
A blood relative. Blood.

211
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,276
Stop saying "blood" to strangers.

212
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,410
And you? How do you know the couple?

213
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,877
We went to college with both of them.

214
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,176
Now we live next door.

215
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:34,875
Okay, you're fine.

216
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,819
-Are you guys ready?
-Yes.

217
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:46,327
I'll have a green salad,
house dressing and water's fine.

218
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,098
And for you, sir?

219
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,961
Yeah. This slow-roasted salmon...

220
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,661
how slow are we talking?

221
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:55,833
It's already been roasted.

222
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,874
Oh, then no. Maybe I should hear
the specials again.

223
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,740
We've heard the specials three times.

224
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,975
There's prime rib, mahi-mahi
and a very special lobster ravioli.

225
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:11,883
-Actually, we're out of the ravioli.
-Well, that changes everything!

226
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:16,324
You know what, Phoebe?
You were right before.

227
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,620
Friends are so important.

228
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:21,128
Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.

229
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:22,923
Know what I really want?

230
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:26,365
-What?
-Is to have a long, long talk.

231
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:30,541
You know? Get Joey out on the
open road and really open him up.

232
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,407
-Any progress?
-Yes.

233
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,411
I will have the lobster ravioli.

234
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,581
God, Joey, this is taking forever.

235
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,410
-What's the rush?
-Well...

236
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,282
I have an appointment.

237
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,390
And it's very important.

238
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,853
What is it?

239
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:49,989
Well...

240
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:51,627
it's a date.

241
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:56,425
A date? No, you must be mistaken,
because you wouldn't have a date...

242
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,297
on the same night
you have plans with a friend.

243
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,403
Don't make me feel badly.

244
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,074
No, I'm gonna!

245
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,307
You made me feel really guilty
about going out with that girl.

246
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:12,450
Like I did something terrible.
Now you're doing the same thing.

247
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:14,949
It's not! It's totally different!

248
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:18,385
This is with David.
Remember David, the scientist guy?

249
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,182
He's very special to me.

250
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,951
My girl the other night was special.
She was a scientist too.

251
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,063
-She was?
-Well, she graduated high school.

252
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,661
Whatever. Know what?

253
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:33,496
He's only here for four
hours and I'm gonna go see him.

254
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,435
-Fine!
-Yeah.

255
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:41,636
What are you still doing here?
I told you, lobster ravioli!

256
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:48,318
I was about to leave.
I didn't think you were coming.

257
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,818
I wouldn't have missed this.

258
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:53,147
Well, I'm very glad you're here.

259
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,820
Oh, you're such a gentleman.

260
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,120
Come on, we're going to my place.

261
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,428
Are you eating the cheesecake
without me?

262
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,707
I will give you $100
to whistle right now.

263
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:21,078
-How can you eat it without me?
-What'll you do?

264
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:25,312
Tell Monica or Joey?
No, you'd have to tell them everything.

265
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:29,391
We're dessert stealers.
We're living outside the law.

266
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,893
I don't trust you with this cake.

267
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,531
I got it first,
and I'm taking it back!

268
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,600
-What? Oh, no.
-Oh, yes.

269
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,469
You think I trust you with it?

270
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,230
No, we'll split it.

271
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,271
That's not fair. You had some.

272
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:47,376
I think Monica would be
very interested to know...

273
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,548
that you called her cheesecake
"dry and mealy."

274
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,978
What do we use to split it?

275
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,555
All right, pick a half.

276
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,718
Well, this side looks bigger.

277
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:06,091
But there's more crust on this side.

278
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,060
Maybe if I measure it..

279
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,494
Pick a piece!

280
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:13,603
-All right, I pick that one.
-It's the smaller piece.

281
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,207
Okay. There you go.

282
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,434
Enjoy your half, my friend.
But that is it.

283
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:23,012
No sharing, no switching,
and don't come crying to me...

284
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,547
if you eat your piece too fast.

285
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:39,825
-You gonna give me some of yours?
-Oh, no.

286
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:44,262
No switching, no sharing.
And don't come crying to me.

287
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:47,400
I may just sit here
and have my cake all day.

288
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,733
Just sit here in the hallway
and eat my..

289
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,589
Ross, sweetheart!

290
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,688
Oh, hey, Aunt Millie.

291
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,952
-Isn't it a beautiful wedding?
-Yes, it is.

292
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,564
Every time, on the lips!

293
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,703
Why? Why on the lips?

294
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:25,568
There's Frannie.
Won't she be happy to see me?

295
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,642
You be nice, all right?

296
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:30,178
I didn't bring you to ambush her.

297
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:33,577
Frannie was the one
who showed your Playboys to Mom.

298
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,787
That bitch.

299
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,319
Monica!

300
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:42,787
What..?

301
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,462
Am I doing here?
Surprised to see me?

302
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:48,097
Ross brought me.
How do you like that?

303
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,791
Hi, Frannie. Congratulations.

304
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,801
You invite my whole family,
and not me? Why?

305
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:59,499
Why wouldn't you want me here?
What could I have done?

306
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,876
Stuart!

307
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,906
I believe you know my husband.

308
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:11,417
So it's really a question
of "who" could you have done.

309
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:22,431
I hate this, but I have to go.

310
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,829
I can't miss my flight.

311
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,402
I bet there's
another flight to Minsk in..

312
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,368
July.

313
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,581
That's really beautiful.
What does it mean?

314
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,379
"Please clean my beakers."

315
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,024
I don't get out of the lab much.

316
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,288
I thought it meant something else.

317
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:56,091
Yeah, well, I really actually
wanted to say...

318
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:57,858
that.

319
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:01,539
But I figured I probably shouldn't
because...

320
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,270
I have to leave.

321
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:07,034
No, you're right. Don't say it.

322
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,909
I do, though.

323
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,452
I do too.

324
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,059
Well, bye, Phoebe.

325
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,939
Now's not the time, Joey.
You can yell at me tomorrow.

326
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,976
Wait, no, Phoebe.
I'm not gonna yell at you.

327
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,808
I just started thinking
about you and David...

328
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:50,248
and I remember how bummed you were
the first time he left.

329
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,482
Oh, Phoebe, come here.

330
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,956
-Are you okay?
-No, I'm not okay.

331
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:03,028
The only guy I've ever been
crazy about is going to Minsk...

332
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,964
and I may never see him again.

333
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,998
You could always visit him.

334
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,834
Right. Like they'll let me
have a passport.

335
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:15,010
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.

336
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,974
Well, now...

337
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:23,312
if you achieve distillation of
subatomic particles before he does...

338
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,352
then he could come back.

339
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,328
I could give it a shot.

340
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:42,872
Oh, look! There's a piece
that doesn't have floor on it.

341
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,804
-Stick to your side!
-Come on, now!

342
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,988
All right, what are we having?

343
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,732
Oh, wait, I forgot my wrap.

344
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,334
Okay, wait here.

345
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:32,022
Hi, sweetie! Are you leaving?

346
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,885
-Well..
-Give us a kiss. Come on.

347
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:47,501
Why? Why on the lips?

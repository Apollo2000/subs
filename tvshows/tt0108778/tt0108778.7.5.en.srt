1
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:08,601
-What's the matter?
-Someone on the subway licked my neck!

2
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:10,935
Willy's still alive!

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,946
-What are you doing?
-My mom called.

4
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:16,342
They're announcing
our engagement in the paper.

5
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:20,848
-We're looking for a good picture.
-I'm afraid that does not exist.

6
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,585
There are great pictures of us.

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,054
No, there are great pictures of you
next to a guy who's going like this...

8
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:33,828
Oh, my God, that's the creep that
you're with at the Statue of Liberty.

9
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:38,262
I don't know what it is.
I just can't take a good picture.

10
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:39,699
Here's a great one.

11
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:44,138
-Yeah, I'm not in that.
-No, but look at me, all tan.

12
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:47,880
Why don't you get portraits done
by a professional photographer?

13
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:51,879
That's a great idea. I bet they have
one of those wind machines.

14
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:58,055
Yeah, that's great. Next to that,
Chandler won't look so stupid.

15
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:03,156
-Chandler, what do you say?
-All right, but I'm not going.

16
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,193
"I'm" going.

17
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:08,092
The One With The Engagement Picture

18
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,700
Dude, that reverse lay-up.

19
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,135
-And how about those three-pointers?
-Amazing.

20
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:52,277
And those guys were this close
to letting us play this time too.

21
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,779
Hey, look. Phoebe's talking
to Cute Coffeehouse Guy.

22
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,819
You call him "Cute Coffeehouse Guy"?
We call him "Hums While He Pees."

23
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:08,554
Yes, and we call Ross
"Lingers in the Bathroom."

24
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:13,120
Hey, you guys, "Hums While He Pees"
just asked me out.

25
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:17,795
-I thought that guy was married.
-He's getting divorced.

26
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:19,698
Ross, maybe you know him.

27
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,202
It's not a club.

28
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:28,377
If he's getting a divorce,
is it a good idea to date him?

29
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:33,342
-Hey, divorced men are not bad men.
-That's on the napkins at the club.

30
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,583
-I gotta go to work.
-You don't have to go for a half-hour.

31
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:42,350
My assistant, Tag, does sit-ups
in the office during lunch.

32
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:46,730
I could just spread him on a cracker.

33
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,099
Rach, why would you hire this guy?

34
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,238
-You know you can't date him, right?
-I know that.

35
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:59,342
We spend so much time together,
he should call me his "work-wife."

36
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,705
Soon he'll be able to call you "that
lady he knew that got fired."

37
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,578
I won't get fired, because
I'm not gonna act on it.

38
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,050
You wouldn't mind
if he was dating someone?

39
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:14,886
Why, is he? He is, isn't he?
He's dating that slut in marketing.

40
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,620
Maybe I should open
a divorced men's club.

41
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,324
Dude, that's so sad.

42
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:24,603
I could put a basketball court
in the back.

43
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,535
Could I play?

44
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,207
Oh, no sit-ups today, Tag?

45
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:39,048
-I just did them.
-Well, drop and give me 10 more.

46
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:41,618
What?

47
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,788
I had a drink with lunch.

48
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,858
-Did those cost reports come in?
-I did them last night.

49
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,925
Could you make me 4 copies?

50
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,961
-Sure.
-Great, thank you.

51
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:16,621
-Hey, Rachel.
-Hi, Melissa. What's up?

52
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:20,850
I'm just about to go out to the store.

53
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,722
Get some stuff to put in my backpack.

54
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,727
Dried fruit and granola,
and stuff like that.

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,865
-What's up?
-Is Tag here?

56
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,126
No. Why?

57
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,804
I was gonna talk to him about tonight.

58
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:37,306
Really? You got a little crush
on Tag there, do ya?

59
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,338
We've been flirting back and forth...

60
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,607
but I was hoping tonight it would
turn into something a little more.

61
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:47,843
Easy there, Melissa.
This ain't a locker room, okay.

62
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:55,854
But you know, I remember him saying
that he had plans tonight.

63
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,626
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yeah.

64
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,523
All right, back to work.

65
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,535
Hey, isn't that Tag's backpack?

66
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:10,869
I don't want to be known as the office
bitch, but I'll call your supervisor.

67
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:21,144
Great, that's great, Monica. Great.

68
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:24,254
Now, Chandler, you want to
give us a smile?

69
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,718
Okay.

70
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:32,631
-I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?
-No, I am.

71
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:36,397
Chandler, I know you can do this.
You have a beautiful smile.

72
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,830
-I do?
-Yeah.

73
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,703
Maybe you don't have to smile.
Let's try something else.

74
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,410
-Try looking sexy.
-Okay.

75
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,711
Or not.

76
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,059
Hi, Joey, what are you doing here?

77
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:07,028
I got an audition down the street,
and I spilled sauce on my shirt.

78
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:11,403
-You got an extra one?
-Yeah, sure.

79
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,367
Here.

80
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:16,973
Great.

81
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,368
You got anything that's
not Ralph Lauren?

82
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,976
Yeah, I don't think so, Joe.

83
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,618
I guess this'll be fine.

84
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:31,186
-What are you doing tonight?
-Nothing. Why?

85
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:34,587
How would you feel about
taking out Tag? I'll pay.

86
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:39,961
It's gonna take a lot of money for
me to go out on a date with a dude.

87
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,402
I'm not asking you to go on
a date with him.

88
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:47,572
Really? Because I could kind of
use the money.

89
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:52,308
He's new in town and
he doesn't have any guy friends.

90
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,570
Take him to a ball game or something.
I'd appreciate it.

91
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,947
-Yeah, okay, no problem.
-Thank you.

92
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:00,617
Ooh, hey, doughnuts!

93
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,859
I know. Let's try a look...

94
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:14,463
of far-off wonderment.

95
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:20,228
Gaze into our future and think about
our marriage and the days to come.

96
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:29,141
Chandler, what is the matter
with your face?

97
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:32,317
This picture should say
"Geller and Bing to be married"...

98
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:35,612
not "Local woman saves
drowning moron."

99
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,021
Hey, don't laugh at him.
He's my drowning moron.

100
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,354
That's it, that's it!
Take it, take it!

101
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,295
I like this one.

102
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:55,338
It seems to say, "I love you and
that's why I have to kill you."

103
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,300
Can't all be bad.

104
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,712
Find the one where you make
your bedroom eyes.

105
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,138
There it is.

106
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,717
Oh, my God,
those are my bedroom eyes?

107
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,685
Why did you ever sleep with me?

108
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,418
Do you really want to pull
at that thread?

109
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,090
-I'm having a good time.
-Me too.

110
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,198
Sorry that guy on the subway
licked your neck.

111
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,937
No, that's okay. He's a friend.

112
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,304
I don't mean to be presumptuous...

113
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,536
but I have tickets to the
ballroom-dancing finals tomorrow.

114
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,445
Yeah, I..

115
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:39,913
Well, I missed the semifinals,
so I think I would just be lost.

116
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:44,081
I know it's lame, but I got
these tickets from my boss..

117
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,951
Oh, no, no, no, my God!

118
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,320
Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.

119
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,554
It's my ex-wife, Whitney.

120
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,732
I cannot deal with her now.
She's crazy.

121
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,526
Okay, I know. Hold on.

122
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,195
-Hey, Ross.
-Yeah.

123
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,765
That's Whitney, Kyle's ex-wife
out there.

124
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,638
Do you think you could divert her
so we could slip out?

125
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,904
What? No.

126
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:14,043
Okay, but I have two tickets to
the ballroom-dance finals.

127
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:17,151
I don't think so, Phoebe.

128
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,958
All right, I'll do it.

129
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,928
-But just because you're a friend.
-Okay.

130
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,810
Hi, Ginger.

131
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,641
I want my key back.

132
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,374
-I don't have it.
-It's right there.

133
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,887
Okay, Sherlock.

134
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,814
I'm sorry, but you'd better go.

135
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,185
I just wanted to thank you
for diverting Kyle's ex.

136
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,329
You're welcome.
We'll talk about it later.

137
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,034
-Hi, Whitney.
-Hi, Ross.

138
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,763
-Are you ready for breakfast?
-Yep.

139
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:12,203
Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed
to divert her, not date her.

140
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:16,679
Can you give me a second
while I talk to this woman...

141
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,282
who, by the way, did not
spend the night?

142
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,208
Sure.

143
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:28,487
I did divert her, and we ended up
having a great time, okay?

144
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,286
Watching ballroom dancing?

145
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:33,556
Yes, that's where we realized
we were both super cool people.

146
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,869
Look, Kyle just told me
some really bad stuff about her.

147
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:40,160
Like what?

148
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:44,072
Like she's really mean, and
she's overly critical and..

149
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:49,337
She will paint a room a really bright
color without even checking with you.

150
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,345
Okay.

151
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:55,844
And she uses sex as a weapon.

152
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,487
Thank you for warning me.

153
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:02,593
At breakfast, I'll be on alert for
room painting and sex weapons.

154
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:06,488
-You're still gonna go out with her?
-Yeah.

155
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:09,166
Well, didn't you hear
what I just said?

156
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:12,403
Phoebe, come on.
I mean, consider the source.

157
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,574
Of course her ex-husband's gonna say
that stuff. Now if you'll excuse me.

158
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,074
Listen to me, she is crazy!

159
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:23,113
Your door isn't soundproof.

160
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:28,177
You see? Nothing is good enough
for her.

161
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,256
-Morning.
-Hi, Tag.

162
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:39,021
-Did you have fun with Joey?
-Yeah, we went to the Knicks game.

163
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:40,929
That's nice.

164
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:44,728
Then we went to a bar, and he
hooked us up with all these women.

165
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:51,004
Women? You mean, like old women?

166
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,938
Kind of old, like 30.

167
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:03,645
I never used to be able
to talk to girls in bars...

168
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:07,120
but I got like 20 phone numbers
last night.

169
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:11,585
That's great.

170
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:14,288
Joey must have really taught
you some stuff.

171
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,624
A little.

172
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,895
How you doing?

173
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:31,676
See? That's a great smile.
Easy, natural.

174
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,748
Now pretend I have a camera.

175
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,248
-You're changing it.
-I can't help it.

176
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,790
You want to know what I do
when I take resume shots?

177
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,061
Borrow money from me?

178
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:49,428
Yeah. Okay, first of all,
you want to make it look spontaneous.

179
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:54,162
So here's what I do. I look down,
look down, keep looking down.

180
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,140
Then I look up.

181
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,434
See? Now you try.

182
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,045
Look down. You're looking down.
Keep looking down.

183
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,308
Why is there jelly on your shoe?

184
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:08,618
I had a donut.

185
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:15,587
So, I heard you had some fun
with Tag last night.

186
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,057
Yeah, he's all right.

187
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:21,392
Yeah, and you had fun teaching him
how to be all "Joey."

188
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,460
-What?
-You know, all the women.

189
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,570
You can't teach someone
to be good with women.

190
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,275
That's why I never had
any luck with Chandler.

191
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,976
I'm right here.

192
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,587
Would you mind just not
going out with him again?

193
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:46,121
Just the idea of you and he
and all these women..

194
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,759
I know he's my assistant,
and we can't date!

195
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,723
But it bothers me, all right?

196
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,592
No, no, no, you can't take him
away from me.

197
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:57,565
I got a great partner to pick
up girls with. Finally!

198
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:04,002
I'm still right here.

199
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,334
Will you talk to him...

200
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:11,140
and tell him how unsatisfying
this dating-tons-of-women thing is?

201
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,413
What?

202
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,256
I don't want him to meet anybody
until I'm over my crush.

203
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,718
I will get over it.

204
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,826
It's not like I love him.
It's just physical.

205
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:26,929
I get these crushes all the time.
I had a crush on you at first.

206
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,029
I know. Monica told me.

207
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,998
Did you have a crush on me
when we first met?

208
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,237
Yeah, sure.

209
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,647
Can you people not see me?

210
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,285
Will you talk to him?

211
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:52,321
-I don't know, Rach.
-I'll give you 10 Ralph Lauren shirts.

212
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,887
One.

213
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,753
No, 10. You said 10.
You can't take that back.

214
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,360
You wanted to talk to me?

215
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,867
I don't know.
You got something for me?

216
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,699
Yeah, this is from Rachel.

217
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:16,810
Ten. Okay.

218
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,313
Tag, there's such a thing
as too many women.

219
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:22,215
-Really?
-Yeah, for you.

220
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,423
-Hey, there you are.
-There I am.

221
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:34,187
-You okay?
-Yeah, Joey said I needed to relax.

222
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,196
So he gave me an antihistamine.

223
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:37,926
What?

224
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,695
I fell asleep on the subway
and went to Brooklyn.

225
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,431
Brooklyn is far.

226
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:45,838
What were you thinking?

227
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:49,708
But don't worry, because
I know how to take a picture now.

228
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,846
Okay, see. Look down.

229
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,883
Look down.

230
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,185
Look down.

231
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,693
-Chandler?
-Yeah?

232
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:18,066
How are things going with Crazy?
Has she cooked your rabbit yet?

233
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:22,377
Listen, you are hearing one side
of the story. Okay?

234
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:26,243
FYI, she must have shown Kyle
over 30 paint samples...

235
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,077
before she painted that room.

236
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:34,356
And his response to each one was,
"I don't give a tiny rat's ass."

237
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,854
Maybe she should have spent
a little less time decorating...

238
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,395
and a little more time
in the bedroom.

239
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,424
I don't think we are going
to have that problem...

240
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,605
but maybe it's because I am not
emotionally unavailable.

241
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,304
You think he's
emotionally unavailable?

242
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,602
I think he can be.

243
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,740
Maybe he wouldn't be...

244
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,380
if she didn't bring the office
home every night.

245
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,916
Excuse her for knowing
what she wants to do with her life.

246
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,318
Well, she certainly knew what
she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.

247
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,492
I knew you were going
to throw that in my face!

248
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:13,595
That was three years ago.
She apologized and apologized.

249
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,165
What more do you want?!

250
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,936
We want the last 6 years back!

251
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:22,005
So do we! So do we!

252
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,906
I'm sorry you had to see that.

253
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,549
-Morning, Rachel.
-Hi.

254
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,981
Hey, so, what'd you do last night?

255
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:38,983
-Went out with Joey.
-Yeah?

256
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,853
Another night of bird-dogging
the chicas?

257
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:46,157
No, we had a really good talk.

258
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:50,133
I don't think I'll do
the bar scene anymore.

259
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,304
Wow, I did not see that coming.

260
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:55,803
It's just not really who I am.

261
00:17:56,008 --> 00:18:00,069
I've always been happier when..
Why am I telling you this?

262
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,803
-You don't care about this stuff.
-Yes, I do.

263
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:07,383
You were saying,
"I'm happier when I..."

264
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,144
When I'm in a relationship.

265
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,652
-I love having a girlfriend.
-Really?

266
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,052
Someone I can spoil, you know.

267
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:16,226
Spoil?

268
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,896
Let me ask you something.

269
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,035
Do you believe there's one perfect
person for everyone?

270
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,670
I'm starting to.

271
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:30,674
If that person's in your life
you should do something?

272
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,503
Yes. Hell, yes.

273
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,012
All right, then, it's settled.

274
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:38,479
-I'm getting back together with my ex.
-I would love to!

275
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,208
What?

276
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,057
Hello?

277
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,225
This is gonna be a while. Excuse me.

278
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,032
Yeah.

279
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:07,567
My God!

280
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,749
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying?

281
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:14,918
And speaking of being selfish in bed,
how's Whitney?

282
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,556
Maybe she wouldn't have to be
selfish in bed...

283
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,556
if someone else knew where
everything was.

284
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:25,528
Oh, he knows.

285
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,322
For the most part.

286
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,095
Oh, hey.
Good, you're both here.

287
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,233
We kind of need to talk.

288
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,669
-Both of you together?
-What's up?

289
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:41,106
Well, I went over to Kyle's last night
to pick up a few things...

290
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:44,077
and we got to reminiscing.

291
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:45,910
We talked most of the night...

292
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:49,849
and realized the reason
we're angry with each other...

293
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,786
is because there are still
feelings there.

294
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,490
So...

295
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,757
Oh, just say it, Kyle!

296
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,299
We're gonna try again.

297
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,599
What about her whining,
and her constant need for attention?

298
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:09,967
I'll work on that.

299
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,473
Right, because you're so
capable of change.

300
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,139
You know, he hums when he pees.

301
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:22,382
-I do know.
-Makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.

302
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,389
We're so sorry.

303
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:30,027
That's all right. We don't need you.
I'm over it already.

304
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,460
Yeah, and I don't even give
a tiny rat's ass.

305
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,795
Yeah, we're gonna go.

306
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,634
I'm sorry.

307
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:47,207
Phoebe, you were right about her.

308
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,181
You know, she did try to use
sex as a weapon.

309
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,510
Yeah, I hurt my back a little.

310
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,015
You know, he hums while he does
other stuff too.

311
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:04,128
We're better off without them.

312
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:09,162
Even if they break up again, you better
not let him in your sad men's club.

313
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:12,667
-Divorced men's club.
-Po-tay-to, po-tah-to.

314
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:21,003
Hey, check it out.

315
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,738
-My mom sent me the paper.
-Let's see it.

316
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:30,187
-Oh, yeah, that looks good.
-You make a very attractive couple.

317
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:36,752
-Yeah, we look great together.
-We really do.

318
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:38,729
Okay.

319
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,458
Imagine what our kids would look like.

320
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,266
We don't have to imagine.

321
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:46,969
I'm marrying her.

322
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:48,899
We'll just see.

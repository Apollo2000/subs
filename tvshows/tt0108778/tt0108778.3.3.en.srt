{395}{495}See, Joe, that's why your parents|told you not to jump on the bed !
{552}{579}The One With the Jam
{1680}{1757}Hey, look at me !|I'm making jam !
{1763}{1861}- I've been at it since 4 a.m.|- Where'd you get fruit at 4 a.m. ?
{1867}{1937}Went down to the docks. Betcha|didn't know you can get it wholesale.
{1955}{1998}I didn't know there were docks.
{2056}{2086}- Hey.|- Hey.
{2091}{2123}Is it broken ?
{2127}{2186}No, but I gotta wear this|for a couple weeks.
{2192}{2266}Did you tell the doctor you did it|jumping up and down on your bed ?
{2285}{2364}No. I had a whole story|worked out, but then...
{2370}{2405}...Chandler sold me out.
{2409}{2470}I'm sorry, Joe. I didn't think|the doctor was gonna buy...
{2474}{2536}...that it just fell out of the socket.
{2565}{2621}What is this ? Fruit ?
{2698}{2729}Monica's making jam.
{2733}{2848}Oh, jam ? I love jam ! Hey, how come|we never have jam at our place ?
{2855}{2906}Because the kids need new shoes.
{2937}{3028}I'm going into business. I'm sick and|tired of being depressed about Richard.
{3033}{3098}I needed a plan.|A plan to get over my man.
{3104}{3178}What's the opposite of man ? Jam !
{3225}{3279}Oh, Joey, don't ! It's way too hot !
{3447}{3495}This'll just be my batch.
{3928}{3952}That's it. No.
{3956}{3993}Hey, you, J. Crew guy...
{3998}{4042}Why have you been following me ?
{4046}{4101}All week long,|everywhere I look, there's you.
{4112}{4146}You wouldn't return my calls.
{4150}{4191}- You sent back my letters.|- What ?
{4195}{4250}One more chance, Ursula. Please.
{4337}{4366}Oh, well, this is awkward.
{4411}{4503}Yeah, because you want Ursula,|and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters.
{4534}{4572}Seriously.
{4608}{4665}That's great.|I'm stalking the wrong woman.
{4669}{4723}I am such a dingus !
{4735}{4782}Oh, you're not a dingus.
{4787}{4876}I just want you to know|I didn't used to be like this.
{4880}{4939}Before I met your sister,|I was like this normal guy...
{4943}{4988}...who sold beepers and cellular phones.
{5034}{5094}I mean, look,|it's not your fault, you know.
{5098}{5213}I mean, this is just what she|does to guys, okay ? So just...
{5235}{5263}Well, thanks.
{5273}{5331}Wait. You know what ?|I got a little story.
{5350}{5442}When I was in junior high, I went through|a period where I thought I was a witch.
{5446}{5492}And there was this guidance|counselor who...
{5496}{5552}...said something that|I think will help you a lot.
{5556}{5662}He said, "Okay, you're not a witch.|You're just an average student."
{5683}{5750}- See what I'm saying ?|- Not really.
{5779}{5813}Well, get over it.
{5866}{5992}So... I mean, you just, you seem like|a really nice guy. You know, and just...
{5996}{6047}Don't be so hard on yourself, okay ?
{6052}{6153}You're right. I know you're right.|And thanks for being so nice.
{6185}{6209}Here.
{6219}{6258}Thanks a lot.
{6274}{6311}Do you want to get a cup of coffee ?
{6315}{6370}- Yeah, okay.|- Okay.
{6427}{6491}You don't have|to walk behind me anymore.
{6531}{6598}- Mon ?|- Mon ?
{6627}{6710}"Gone for more jars. Back later.|Monica Geller."
{6747}{6789}- Wait a minute. Look !|- What ?
{6793}{6834}- Look. Look. Look.|- What ? What ? What ?
{6838}{6891}It's an empty apartment.
{6897}{6970}We're all alone|in an empty apartment.
{6974}{7059}Oh, honey, come on. I have|to be at work in, like, ten minutes.
{7079}{7180}All right. Well, it's not like|I'm employee of the year or anything.
{7305}{7330}There it is !
{7334}{7382}Oh, that's what you're talking about.
{7387}{7438}- Hey.|- Hey.
{7454}{7481}Do I look fat ?
{7503}{7530}- No.|- No.
{7535}{7583}Okay. I accept that.
{7587}{7657}When Janice asked me and I said no,|she took that to mean...
{7661}{7717}...that I was calling her a cow.
{7721}{7803}Okay. Walk us through it, honey.|Walk us through it.
{7807}{7919}Okay, well, Janice said, "Hi. Do I look|fat today ?" And I looked at her...
{7923}{8009}Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. You looked at her ?
{8075}{8105}You never look.
{8134}{8233}You just answer. It's like a reflex.|"Do I look fat ?" "No."
{8292}{8363}"Is she prettier than I am ?"|"No."
{8391}{8417}- Does size matter ?|- No !
{8421}{8463}And it works both ways.
{8539}{8614}Okay, so you both|just know this stuff ?
{8618}{8698}You know, after about 30 or 40 fights,|you kind of catch on.
{8733}{8769}Okay. For instance:
{8774}{8886}Let's say, Janice is coming back from|a trip and she gives you two options.
{8891}{8959}Option number one: She'll take|a cab home from the airport.
{8963}{9058}Or option two: You can meet her|at baggage claim. What do you do ?
{9062}{9138}- That's easy. Baggage claim.|- Wrong ! Now you're single.
{9194}{9274}It's actually secret|option number three.
{9283}{9362}You meet her at the gate.|That way she knows you love her.
{9389}{9414}Okay, this is good.
{9418}{9512}All right, listen. I have one.|Janice likes to cuddle...
{9516}{9576}...at night,|which I'm all for.
{9580}{9666}But when you want to go to sleep,|you want some space.
{9670}{9739}So how do I tell her that without...
{9746}{9822}...you know, accidentally|calling her fat or something ?
{9831}{9937}Oh, honey. I'm sorry. We can't help you|there, because we're cuddly sleepers.
{9970}{10054}Okay. I'm late for work. All right.|Are you guys going to come down ?
{10059}{10133}- Yeah. I'm right behind you.|- Okay. Good luck, Chandler.
{10137}{10167}- Thank you.|- Bye, sweetie.
{10171}{10200}Bye, honey.
{10242}{10302}Okay, the sleeping thing.
{10318}{10380}Very tricky business,|but there is something you can do.
{10384}{10464}- I thought you were "cuddly sleepers."|- No.
{10509}{10570}No. Not cuddly.|Not me. Just her.
{10575}{10627}I'm like you.|I need the room.
{10635}{10666}Okay, come here.
{10752}{10842}- Okay. You're in bed.|- Yeah.
{10925}{10984}- I'm gonna use the cushion.|- Yeah.
{11018}{11111}Okay. You're in bed.|She's over on your side, cuddling.
{11118}{11190}Now, you wait for her to drift off...
{11202}{11250}...and then you hug her...
{11265}{11373}...and roll her over|to her side of the bed.
{11383}{11421}And then you...
{11455}{11505}...roll away.
{11547}{11590}Hug for her.
{11663}{11715}Roll for you.
{11755}{11794}Okay. The old "hug and roll."
{11807}{11849}- Okay. One question.|- Shoot.
{11853}{11918}You're pretending|the pillow's a girl, right ?
{11988}{12086}Remember when you were a kid and your|mom would drop you off at the movies...
{12090}{12167}...with a jar of jam|and a little spoon ?
{12224}{12270}You're so pretty.
{12391}{12435}- Hi !|- Hey, Phoebe !
{12439}{12532}Hey, you know that guy who's been|following me ? I talked to him today.
{12536}{12577}You talked to him ?
{12581}{12636}Are you crazy ?
{12651}{12741}Okay. First, I'm not crazy.|And second, say it, don't spray it.
{12773}{12854}Anyway, his name is Malcolm,|and he wasn't following me.
{12859}{12927}I mean, he was, but just|because he thought I was Ursula.
{12986}{13070}That's why he couldn't just|come up and talk to me.
{13089}{13158}Because of the restraining order.
{13211}{13260}Not feeling better about Malcolm.
{13302}{13350}No, no, no. He's not a kook.
{13354}{13446}He's just this, like, very passionate,|incredibly romantic guy...
{13451}{13518}...that just got, like, a teensy bit|carried away, you know.
{13522}{13599}And we just get along really well,|and he is so cute.
{13623}{13746}Oh, my God ! You've got a crush|on your sister's stalker.
{13753}{13823}I'm just going to help him.|You know. Get de-Ursula-ized.
{13827}{13899}Like, you know. Like I did for Joey|after he went out with her.
{13902}{13935}I didn't stalk her, I mean...
{13963}{14048}- I asked for the news, not the weather.|- Sorry.
{14052}{14123}- Hey, guys.|- Hey, Mon.
{14130}{14209}Joey, this is for you.|It's blackberry currant.
{14373}{14412}Joe, I got to ask.
{14417}{14485}The girl from the Xerox place,|buck naked...
{14510}{14562}...or a big tub of jam ?
{14603}{14648}Put your hands together.
{14747}{14808}Joey, take your time with that.|That's my last batch.
{14826}{14862}No more jam ?
{14885}{14937}Well, what happened|to your jam plan ?
{14942}{15027}I figured out I'd need to charge|17 bucks a jar just to break even.
{15031}{15110}So I've got a new plan now.|Babies.
{15140}{15199}Well, you're gonna|need much bigger jars.
{15251}{15336}- What are you talking about ?|- I'm talking about me having a baby.
{15341}{15396}- Are you serious ?|- Yeah.
{15400}{15483}The great thing about the jam plan|was I was taking control of my life.
{15487}{15574}So I asked myself, "What is the most|important thing to me in the world ?"
{15579}{15631}And that's when I came up|with the baby plan.
{15635}{15694}Aren't you forgetting something ?
{15707}{15774}What is that guy's name ?|Dad !
{15819}{15904}It took me 28 years to find one man|that I wanted to spend my life with.
{15909}{16007}If I have to wait another 28 years,|then I'll be 56 before I can have a baby.
{16012}{16058}And that's just stupid.
{16091}{16144}That's what's stupid ?
{16181}{16307}I don't need an actual man.|Just a couple of his best swimmers.
{16320}{16404}And there are places that|you can go to get that stuff.
{16408}{16459}Down to the docks again ?
{16692}{16764}Night-night, Bing-a-ling.
{16799}{16835}Night-night...
{16856}{16885}...Janice.
{16975}{17054}Look at all that room on her side !
{17058}{17104}You could fit a giant penguin over there.
{17153}{17184}That'd be weird, though.
{17231}{17262}Hug and roll time.
{17267}{17323}I'm hugging. I'm hugging.
{17329}{17385}You're rolling, and...
{17401}{17438}Yes ! Freedom !
{17456}{17503}Except for this arm !
{17526}{17591}I'm stuck. Stuck arm.
{17611}{17696}Okay. Time for the old tablecloth trick.|One fluid motion.
{17700}{17748}Quick like a cat. Quick like a cat.
{17752}{17822}And one, two...
{17826}{17870}... three !
{18065}{18109}Here's my binoculars.
{18128}{18230}Great. You're doing great, you know.|Real strong. Going strong. Keep going.
{18261}{18315}These are my night-vision goggles.
{18335}{18423}This is the book I pretend to read|when I'm watching her in the park.
{18445}{18548}And these are Mad Libs.|They're just for fun.
{18552}{18589}What's this ?
{18593}{18690}This is the log I kept,|recording her every movement.
{18695}{18739}You want to hear something from it ?
{18743}{18789}Not even a little bit.
{18821}{18845}It's about you.
{18849}{18892}Oh. Okay, then.
{19016}{19059}"I met Phoebe today.
{19072}{19167}She was really nice to me|even though I'm such a loser.
{19170}{19248}And when I was walking home,|I thought about her a lot.
{19255}{19327}It was weird, but kind of cool."
{19355}{19379}Good.
{19422}{19461}So, what were you thinking ?
{19489}{19551}I was thinking what|it'd be like to kiss you.
{19556}{19589}- Really ?|- No.
{19668}{19754}See, that's just something I said now|so that maybe I could kiss you.
{19767}{19813}Oh, okay.
{19952}{20027}No, it's all right.|I just had a jar of mustard.
{20054}{20180}Okay. Sperm donor number 03815,|come on down !
{20196}{20249}Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds.
{20253}{20326}And he describes himself|as a male Geena Davis.
{20331}{20390}You mean there's|more than one of us ?
{20421}{20503}You can't do this, Mon.|All right. If you do this, I'm gonna...
{20507}{20590}- You're gonna what ?|- I'm gonna tell Mom.
{20595}{20685}Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right.|I love you, but you're crazy.
{20689}{20752}Why ? Why is this crazy ?
{20761}{20822}- So this isn't the ideal way...|- Oh, it's not the ideal... ?
{20830}{20872}Lips moving. Still talking.
{20902}{20950}It may not be ideal, but...
{20958}{21000}...l'm so ready.
{21014}{21066}I see the way|Ben looks at you.
{21080}{21142}It makes me ache, you know ?
{21146}{21235}Check it out ! Jam crackers !
{21299}{21350}Okay. All right, how's this ?
{21358}{21424}Twenty-seven, Italian-American guy.
{21430}{21468}He's an actor.
{21475}{21514}Born in Queens.
{21521}{21598}Wow ! Big family.|Seven sisters...
{21620}{21710}...and he's the only boy.
{21775}{21863}Oh, my God ! Under personal comments:|"New York Knicks rule."
{21867}{21904}Yeah, the Knicks rule !
{22000}{22049}Joey, this is you !
{22053}{22106}Let me see.
{22149}{22178}Oh, right.
{22208}{22250}When did you go to a sperm bank ?
{22255}{22322}Oh, right after I did|that sex study down at NYU.
{22327}{22389}Hey, remember that sweater|I gave you for your birthday ?
{22394}{22453}And that's how you bought it ?
{22471}{22548}No. That's what I was wearing|when I donated.
{22626}{22710}I'm kind of surprised there's|any of my boys left.
{22715}{22809}Honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean,|I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
{22813}{22865}Maybe I should call this place|and get them...
{22869}{22918}...to put my Days of our Lives|gig on here.
{22922}{22965}Juice this puppy up a little.
{23011}{23049}- Hey.|- Hey !
{23053}{23084}How's the maniac ?
{23095}{23163}He's yummy.|We did a little kissing.
{23186}{23237}- Phoebe, what are you doing ?|- Oh, no.
{23241}{23361}No. No. You know what ? He's not|into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
{23366}{23491}This guy has been obsessed with your|sister for God knows how long, okay.
{23495}{23546}You don't just give up|something like that.
{23550}{23638}So look, he gave me his night-vision|goggles and everything. So...
{23654}{23751}You're taking the word of a guy|who has night-vision goggles ?
{23755}{23848}What ? He's not still following her.|You think he's still following her ?
{23852}{23925}Pheebs. Wake up and smell|the restraining order.
{23970}{24006}What are you saying I should do ?
{24010}{24083}I think that if you really like this guy,|you should just trust him.
{24087}{24115}Thank you, Monica.
{24119}{24179}Or you could follow him|and see where he goes.
{24183}{24243}Oh, that's what I would do.|Forget mine.
{24313}{24345}Oh, my God ! What happened ?
{24349}{24464}Oh, God. Crazy Chandler.|He spun me off the bed.
{24468}{24537}Wow ! Spinning.|That sounds like fun.
{24587}{24623}I wish.
{24628}{24740}No. You know, he was just|trying Ross' "hug and roll" thing.
{24800}{24824}Ross' what ?
{24828}{24935}You know. Like where he hugs you|and then kind of rolls you away, and...
{25007}{25032}Oh...
{25036}{25066}...my...
{25070}{25122}...God !
{25882}{25938}- Phoebe ?|- Yes ? Yes !
{25983}{26008}What are you doing ?
{26012}{26090}Oh, I was just here|looking for my...
{26099}{26162}Part of an old sandwich.|Here it is !
{26205}{26258}Were you following me ?
{26281}{26307}Perhaps.
{26329}{26392}Yes. Yes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
{26398}{26471}I was just afraid that you|were still hung up on my sister.
{26475}{26534}So you spied on me.
{26539}{26594}I can't believe|you don't trust me.
{26731}{26839}Oh, well, what do you know ?|There goes my identical twin sister !
{26846}{26908}Just walking along, looking like me.
{26941}{27036}Well, is this like a freakish coincidence,|or did you know that she takes this train ?
{27046}{27165}I'm sorry. I'm sorry.|I tried to stop, but I couldn't.
{27179}{27222}I'm so pathetic.
{27227}{27322}No. No, it's not your fault.|You know, it's partly my fault.
{27326}{27388}It's 'cause I made you quit cold turkey.
{27426}{27514}Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you|anymore because you're, you know...
{27519}{27548}Wow !
{27594}{27698}But I will definitely, definitely|help you get over my sister. Okay ?
{27717}{27774}Stalk me for a while, huh ?
{27795}{27876}Yeah, and I'll be like an Ursula patch.
{27910}{27949}- I don't know.|- Yeah ! Just...
{27953}{28004}Okay. Look, I'm going !
{28015}{28058}Come on.
{28068}{28152}I'm behind the pillar.|Which way am I gonna go ?
{28195}{28223}- Hey.|- Hey.
{28227}{28284}- Where you going ?|- To the bank.
{28288}{28345}Sperm or regular ?
{28366}{28401}Sperm.
{28407}{28525}- So you're really doing it, huh ?|- Oh, yeah. I picked a guy. 37135.
{28530}{28558}Sounds nice.
{28563}{28634}I'd say so. He's got|brown hair and green eyes.
{28638}{28676}No kidding ?
{28688}{28753}- What ?|- I figured you would have picked a blond.
{28767}{28815}- Really ? Why ?|- I don't know.
{28819}{28935}I always pictured you ending up with a tall,|smart, blond guy with a name like...
{28940}{28965}...Hoyt.
{28998}{29022}Hoyt ?
{29027}{29058}It's a name. Yeah.
{29086}{29197}I saw you in this, you know,|this great house with a big pool.
{29203}{29266}Yeah ? Is he a swimmer ?
{29282}{29315}He's got the body for it.
{29342}{29394}I like that.
{29451}{29484}What ?
{29488}{29527}You have one of those signs that says:

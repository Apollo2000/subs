1
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:03,863
Bye-bye.

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:06,364
I just got reservations
at Michelle's...

3
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:08,971
and tickets to The Music Man
to celebrate...

4
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:11,608
our first holiday
as a betrothed couple.

5
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:14,780
-"Betrothed."
-Betrothed couple.

6
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:24,983
Phoebe?

7
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,749
Skull?

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,257
Yeah, it's my mom's.

9
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:29,985
Oh, my God!

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,723
No, no, no. It's not my mom.

11
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:35,423
It belonged to my mom.

12
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,235
She used to put it out
every Christmas...

13
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:42,738
to remind us that even though
it's Christmas, people still die.

14
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:46,271
And you can put candy in it.

15
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,875
Licorice?

16
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:54,615
Sure.

17
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:58,552
-I get Ben for the holidays this year.
-That's great!

18
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,352
-Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
-Nope.

19
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:03,357
I know Susan does every year.

20
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:06,464
I want to take this year
to teach him about Hanukkah.

21
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,327
And maybe I could teach Ben...

22
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:11,060
about the Christmas skull
and how people die.

23
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:15,267
You may need to use this year
to teach Ben about Phoebe.

24
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,584
-Did you know he was in there?
-No.

25
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,820
-How long have we been home?
-About half an hour.

26
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,321
Lovely.

27
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:38,223
The One With The Holiday Armadillo

28
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,661
You know what I was thinking?
When we get married, will you...

29
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:20,462
change your name to "Bing"?

30
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:22,836
No.

31
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,309
Why not?

32
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,144
Bing's weird.

33
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:32,217
Oh, hey, you guys.

34
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,351
My landlord just called.
My apartment's gonna be ready soon.

35
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,217
I guess I'll be moving out.

36
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,086
Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you.

37
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,194
Yes, you will be very sad.

38
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,892
-I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
-You'll be living together again?

39
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:51,831
-Why not?
-She's having so much fun with Joey...

40
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:54,336
I assumed she'd still
be living with him.

41
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,169
Why do you think
she's having so much fun?

42
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,675
No reason, except she...

43
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,642
told me.

44
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,546
She said she didn't want
to live with me?

45
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:07,479
No. No, she didn't say that.

46
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,383
I think you should talk to Monica now.

47
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,558
Phoebe, I'm sure
she wants to live with you.

48
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,251
You're absolutely sure?

49
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,930
No, but I'll bet she probably does.

50
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,257
Oh, probably?

51
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,831
I don't like that word.

52
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,694
I know what "probably" really means.
Yeah, yeah.

53
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,773
"Oh, your mom
probably won't kill herself."

54
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,777
I'm sorry,
but I'm not hanging my hopes...

55
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,743
of Rachel and I living together
on "probably."

56
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,576
You gotta take care of yourself
in this world.

57
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,084
History teaches us nothing.

58
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,420
Bing doesn't seem so weird now,
does it?

59
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,155
You're home.

60
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,698
Guess what Phoebe got me
for Christmas?

61
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,936
-Drums?
-No, drums!

62
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,547
Could we get
two burritos to go, please?

63
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:22,787
I'm sorry. But not that sorry,
you don't have to live with it.

64
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,053
We have a reservation under Bing.

65
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,962
Okay, we'll have a table for you
in about 45 minutes.

66
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,137
We have tickets
to The Music Man at 8.

67
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:35,136
I'm sorry.
Christmas is a very busy time, sir.

68
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,568
Is this because of the burrito thing?

69
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:43,443
-You need to give him money.
-It was a joke!

70
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:47,352
To get a table. Places like this
are always shaking you down.

71
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:50,920
-Everybody wants a payoff.
-All right, calm down, O'Malley.

72
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:56,257
-I'll slip him some money.
-But you've got to be smooth.

73
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,589
Hey, I can be smooth.

74
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,527
We're in a hurry.
If you could get us a table...

75
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,763
a bit quicker, I'd appreciate it.

76
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,874
-Of course, sir.
-Okay.

77
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,110
-How'd it go?
-Had the money in the wrong hand.

78
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,810
You don't feel...

79
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,922
-Like you're gonna throw up?
-No.

80
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,216
Well, I do. So let's...

81
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:31,828
So, Ben, you...

82
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,499
You know what holiday is coming up?

83
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:35,690
Christmas.

84
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:39,030
Yeah, and you know what
other holiday is coming up?

85
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,569
Christmas Eve.

86
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:44,502
Yes, but also...

87
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,535
Hanukkah!

88
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:52,513
See, you're part Jewish
and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.

89
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,415
Santa has reindeers that can fly.

90
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,087
Right, but on Hanukkah..

91
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,518
Hanukkah is a celebration
of a miracle.

92
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:03,558
Years and years ago there were
these people called the Maccabees.

93
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,160
Okay, that's right. Yes...

94
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,664
but on Hanukkah, we sing:

95
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,509
Okay, it's not a contest.

96
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,603
When is Santa coming?

97
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:25,375
How about this year,
instead of Santa...

98
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:28,314
we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?

99
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,382
No Santa?

100
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,114
Was I bad?

101
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:36,417
No, no, no, you weren't bad.
You've been very good, Ben.

102
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,962
-Santa's mad at me.
-No, hey, hey, come on.

103
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,565
Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay?

104
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,894
You're his favorite little guy.

105
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,571
So Santa's coming?

106
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,399
Yes!

107
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,438
Santa's coming.

108
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,349
It's easy. Just keep it casual.

109
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,919
Shake his hand and give him the money.

110
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,225
-How do you know so much about this?
-I don't know.

111
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,156
Richard used to do it, didn't he?

112
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,092
We'd be eating our soup right now.

113
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,430
Mustached bastard.

114
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:20,430
Those people just left. Come on.
Quick, give him the money.

115
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,263
Excuse me.

116
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,628
So you like the drums.

117
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,770
That's great.

118
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,637
I was worried that
they would create maybe...

119
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,041
an unbearable living situation.

120
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,409
But, okay, well, apparently not.
So, yay!

121
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,818
Hey, we already learned a song.

122
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:11,319
Ready? One, two, three, four.

123
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,059
Tequila!

124
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,623
That's fun.

125
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,328
Here you go.

126
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,641
Thank you, Gunther.
Put her there.

127
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,272
Definitely not easier with coins.

128
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,948
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

129
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:41,980
Hey, Phoebe.

130
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,088
Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.

131
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,089
Hey, Phoebe...

132
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:52,093
if you want to get Joey a gift
that disrupts the entire building...

133
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,356
why not something more subtle...

134
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:55,931
Like a wrecking ball...

135
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:59,571
or a vial of small pox
to release in the hallway?

136
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,672
It's not just the drum noise.
Every five minutes...

137
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,172
Joey throws his sticks
in the air...

138
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:08,345
and I have to hear:
"Oh, my eye! Oh, God, my eye!"

139
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:11,139
-I mean, it's so annoying.
-Yes, thank you.

140
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:15,946
You see, this is how normal people
are supposed to react to drums.

141
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,881
You got Joey drums to annoy Rachel...

142
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,627
so she wouldn't want
to live there anymore?

143
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,790
Maybe on some level.

144
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:36,503
You could just not throw the sticks
up in the air.

145
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,700
What is rock 'n' roll about that?

146
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:43,880
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.

147
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,651
Hold it!
Before you tell me what it is...

148
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,689
Okay, what is it?

149
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,114
It's a...

150
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,657
tarantula!

151
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,930
God, Rachel, I'm sorry.
What was I thinking...

152
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:08,265
giving Joey this big, gross,
scary spider...

153
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:12,033
in such a poorly constructed cage?

154
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,339
What are you talking about?
I love them.

155
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:21,447
I had a tarantula when I was a kid.
But it died because my cat ate it.

156
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,349
And then my cat died.

157
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,515
But, Joey, isn't this cool?

158
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:29,559
Is it on me?
I feel like it's on me. I got..

159
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,055
Oh, isn't that adorable?

160
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,360
Joey is afraid of the tarantula.

161
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,969
He's so adorable.

162
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,432
He's so much fun.

163
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,267
I'm glad you're having
so much fun here.

164
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,704
Wait a minute.

165
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,104
What's the matter?

166
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,436
Our apartment is ready.

167
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:53,217
And that makes you angry because...?

168
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:56,043
Because you'd rather
live here with Joey.

169
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,980
-Where did you get that?
-Monica and Chandler...

170
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,556
said you were having
so much fun here...

171
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:06,458
and apparently no amount of drums
or tarantula is gonna change that.

172
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,402
Did you get all this stuff for Joey...

173
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,094
to try to drive me out
of the apartment?

174
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,705
You might as well
have gotten him a fish.

175
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:19,240
You know how fish freak me out.

176
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,707
Fish.

177
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,312
But it wouldn't have mattered.
We're gonna live together.

178
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:27,950
That's the deal.

179
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,848
Yes, but I wanted you to want
to live with me.

180
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:33,717
But if you're having
so much fun over here..

181
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,025
It's so much more fun with you.

182
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,662
-We did have fun, didn't we?
-We did.

183
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:42,296
They say, if we want,
we could see it tonight.

184
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,636
-I would love to.
-Yay, okay!

185
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,771
-Good, good, good.
-Great. All right. Good.

186
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,771
And Monica asked me
to make the drumming stop.

187
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:57,545
Done.

188
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,057
Hello, sir.
You here to return those pants?

189
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,693
No, these are my pants.

190
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,026
Okay.

191
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,201
-How can I help you?
-Do you have a Santa outfit left?

192
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,775
Two days before Christmas?
Sorry, man.

193
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:29,675
Okay, look.
Do you have anything Christmas-y?

194
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:33,511
I promised my son, and I really
don't want to disappoint him.

195
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:36,778
Come on, you gotta have something.

196
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,357
I'm the Holiday Armadillo!

197
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,560
I'm a friend of Santa's...

198
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,594
and he sent me here to wish you...

199
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,927
a merry Christmas!

200
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:55,231
What happened to Santa,
Holiday Armadillo?

201
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,876
Santa was unavailable...

202
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:02,013
so close to Christmas.

203
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,538
Come in, have a seat.

204
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:08,685
You must be exhausted,
coming all the way from Texas.

205
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,088
-Texas?
-That's right, Ben.

206
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,055
I'm Santa's representative...

207
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:20,128
for all the Southern states.

208
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,460
And Mexico!

209
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,594
But Santa sent me here...

210
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:30,433
to give you these presents, Ben.

211
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:33,906
Maybe the lady will help me
with these presents.

212
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:50,588
Wow, thanks!

213
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,228
You're welcome, Ben.

214
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,763
Merry Christmas.

215
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,935
And happy Hanukkah!

216
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:03,503
Are you for Hanukkah too?
Because I'm part Jewish.

217
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:07,071
You are? Me too.

218
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:11,874
Because armadillos
also wandered in the desert?

219
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:16,083
You want to wander in the hall?

220
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,991
Hey, Ben!

221
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,387
What if the Holiday Armadillo...

222
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:26,120
told you all about
the Festival of Lights?

223
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,321
Cool!

224
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,158
Come on, Ben.

225
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,837
Years and years ago...

226
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,302
there were these people called...

227
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,636
-the Maccabees!
-Ho, ho, ho!

228
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:42,676
Merry Christmas!

229
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,279
Santa!

230
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,918
What are you doing here, Santa?

231
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,652
Well, I'm here to see
my old buddy, Ben.

232
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,055
What are you doing here...

233
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:02,130
Weird Turtle Man?

234
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,836
I'm the Holiday Armadillo...

235
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,371
your part-Jewish friend.

236
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:15,675
You sent me here
to give Ben some presents.

237
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:17,746
Remember?

238
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,173
What?

239
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,350
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?

240
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,184
You bet I did, Ben.

241
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,452
Put her there.

242
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:38,835
Well, it would have worked this time
if his hands weren't so damn small.

243
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:44,171
Ho, ho, ho!

244
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,037
Ben, come open more gifts.

245
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,076
The armadillo and I
will have a talk in the kitchen.

246
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,382
There's a sentence
I never thought I'd say.

247
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,550
What are you doing?

248
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:59,087
You said you were having trouble
finding a Santa costume...

249
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,690
so I borrowed one
from a guy at work.

250
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:04,385
Thank you, but you gotta leave.

251
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,062
-Why?
-Because...

252
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,063
I'm finally getting him excited
about Hanukkah...

253
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:10,633
and you're wrecking it.

254
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:14,896
But I didn't get to shake my belly
like a bowlful of jelly.

255
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,876
I'm sorry, Chandler,
but this is really important to me.

256
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:26,146
Fine, I'll give the suit back.

257
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:30,314
Hey, you think you can keep it
another night?

258
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,556
Santa, really?

259
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,524
Yeah, is that okay?

260
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:40,392
Did your dad ever dress up like Santa?

261
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:44,932
-No.
-Then it's okay!

262
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,398
Okay, Ben. Santa has to go.

263
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,130
Say goodbye.

264
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,936
No, why does he have to go?

265
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:57,442
Because if Santa and the Holiday...

266
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,579
Armadillo...

267
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,120
are ever in the same room
for too long...

268
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,450
the universe will implode!

269
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:11,426
Merry Christmas!

270
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,665
No, why can't the armadillo leave?
I want Santa.

271
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:20,799
Fine, I give up. Santa..

272
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,564
Santa can stay!

273
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:26,500
Well, I'll stay...

274
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:30,271
but only because I want to hear
about Hanukkah.

275
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,650
Ben, will you sit here with Santa...

276
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,013
and learn about Hanukkah?

277
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,314
Okay, Santa.

278
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:40,848
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

279
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,151
All right, it's time...

280
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,660
for the story of Hanukkah.

281
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,994
Years and years ago...

282
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:53,000
there were these people
called the Maccabees!

283
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,664
Merry Christmas!

284
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,986
Oh, wow, look at this place!

285
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,350
Oh, this is terrible.

286
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,254
They've made so many changes...

287
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,554
I can't even feel
my grandmother's presence anymore.

288
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:21,257
Oh, new sconces!

289
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,996
-Oh, my God!
-What?

290
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:28,264
Remember how you told me
your grandmother put up that wall...

291
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,701
-to make that into two bedrooms?
-Yeah.

292
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,207
And that the landlord
might find out...

293
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,538
-and then tear it down?
-Yeah?

294
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,542
Do you really not know
where I'm going?

295
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:41,947
It left. It's one huge room.

296
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,212
Oh, no!

297
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,385
Wow!

298
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:50,385
See?

299
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,261
I guess we'll have to
put the wall back up.

300
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:57,765
-You can't, with the new skylight.
-There's a skylight?

301
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,271
Wow!

302
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:03,900
So should we start looking
for a new place?

303
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:08,910
You know, I'm sensing...

304
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:13,049
that my grandmother
would not be comfortable with that.

305
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,047
Oh, yeah?

306
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,916
Starting to feel her again there,
are we?

307
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,553
-A little bit. Yeah.
-Yeah.

308
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:26,730
Is your grandmother maybe saying
that you should live here alone?

309
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,127
You heard it too? You have the gift.

310
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,003
Phoebe, it's okay.

311
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:35,103
I like living with Joey.

312
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,805
-Are you sure?
-Please. I hate packing...

313
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,409
it's closer to work.

314
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,575
And we do have fun.

315
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:46,282
Although, I'm really gonna miss
living with you.

316
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:49,086
-Oh, me too.
-I know.

317
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:51,984
Did you hear that?

318
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,817
I'm getting something
from your grandmother.

319
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,722
She said since you get to keep
the one-bedroom apartment...

320
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:02,094
you should give Rachel
the purple chair.

321
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,601
No, I do not hear that.

322
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:11,433
And the miracle was that
that little bit of oil...

323
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:15,477
that should have lasted
just one day, burned for....

324
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,615
-Eight whole days.
-That's right.

325
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:21,752
And that's why we celebrate
Hanukkah today. The end.

326
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,887
-Awesome.
-Yeah.

327
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,449
My favorite part...

328
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:29,957
was when Superman
flew all the Jews out of Egypt.

329
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:37,801
The armadillo was actually
not so thrilled about that part.

330
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,039
Okay, Ben, it's time to light...

331
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:45,209
the Hanukkah candles!

332
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,982
Wow! Looks like the Easter Bunny's
funeral in here.

333
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:05,394
Come on, come on.
We're lighting the candles.

334
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,067
I understand why Superman is here...

335
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:15,829
but why is there a porcupine
at the Easter Bunny's funeral?

336
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,347
-You get it?
-I got it.

337
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,280
Back in the cage?

338
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,522
It's back in the cage.

339
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,550
Is the cage closed?

340
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:39,124
Joey, will you just come out here
and stop being such a baby!

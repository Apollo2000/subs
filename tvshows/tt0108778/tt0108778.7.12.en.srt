1
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:07,236
Ross, when's this comet thing start?

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,274
Well, technically, it started
7 billion years ago.

3
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:14,880
Okay. Fine, I'll stop.
No teaching, okay?

4
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:18,915
We'll just watch the pretty light
streaking across the sky.

5
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,586
Okay?

6
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:25,456
Whose official name is Bapstein-King.
Okay! Okay!

7
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:30,460
There it is. Oh, look at that!

8
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:33,598
Isn't Mother Nature amazing?

9
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,126
That's a plane.

10
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:41,972
Well, all right, 1700 bags
of peanuts flying that high...

11
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:43,971
that's pretty amazing too.

12
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:49,808
-I wonder if you can see my apartment.
-No, you can't.

13
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,576
-What?
-I don't know.

14
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,585
Man, look at all those stars.

15
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:02,956
Infinite space. It really makes you
wonder, doesn't it?

16
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,561
-Know what else makes you wonder?
-What?

17
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:08,359
Check out the rack on that chick.

18
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:14,599
The One Where They're Up All Night

19
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,948
We've been out here for two hours...

20
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:59,447
and we haven't seen any
stupid comets. Can we go now?

21
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:02,951
I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.

22
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,191
No, I'm not.

23
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,995
Then why are you wearing
Monica's jacket?

24
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,459
Because it's flattering!

25
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:19,234
Come on, Monica. Come on, Monica.

26
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,801
-We're going too. We got a movie.
-I won't say no to a movie.

27
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,841
Oh, Phoebe, we just actually
wanted to be alone.

28
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:29,174
-Sh. Get me out of here.
-Oh, okay.

29
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,043
-Hey, Ross.
-What?

30
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,948
-Check it out.
-Is it the comet?

31
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:40,253
No. Look, there's a bug
stuck in tar right here.

32
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,518
I can't believe..

33
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:45,253
I bring you to see
the Bapstein-King comet...

34
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,990
one of nature's
most spectacular phenomena...

35
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:52,763
and all you care about are bugs
stuck in tar and some woman.

36
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,337
You know, there's two women, dude.

37
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,279
Show me where.

38
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,182
Okay. Right up here.

39
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:13,387
Joey, where's the pipe
that was holding the door open?

40
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:14,855
I don't know.

41
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,061
Yeah, I do.

42
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,899
-Joey!
-What? Hey, don't look at me!

43
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:34,876
You wanted to come up here and look
for some stupid Burger King comet.

44
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,941
It's called the
Bapstein-King comet, okay?

45
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,677
Hey, Bapstein was a very
well-respected astronomer from..

46
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,522
No!

47
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,832
-Monica.
-She's sleeping.

48
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,906
I know. Just a quick question.

49
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:07,442
Which one was Deep Impact
and which one was Armageddon?

50
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:13,083
Deep Impact was the one
with Robert Duvall.

51
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:16,949
Armageddon is what's going
to happen to you if you wake me up.

52
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:21,216
Sorry, I just can't sleep.

53
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,363
Where's that book you're reading
with two women who are ice-skating...

54
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,128
and wearing those hats
with the flowers on it.

55
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:36,433
Because every time I look
at that cover, I'm like..

56
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,804
It's in the living room,
where there's also a light...

57
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,176
and no one will
kick you in the shin.

58
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,080
What?

59
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,696
Please don't be a spaceship.
Please don't be a spaceship.

60
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,305
Oh, thank God.

61
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,213
How could you be beeping?
I just disconnected you!

62
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:53,579
I took out your battery! How can..?
Don't interrupt me!

63
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,781
Monica! Monica!

64
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,649
Come on!

65
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,758
I can't believe this!

66
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:09,229
All right, well, I guess we know
what we have to do to get down.

67
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,563
Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice.

68
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,670
Help us! Please, help us!

69
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:20,073
We're stuck up on the roof,
and we can't get down!

70
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:22,941
Ross.

71
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,148
I was thinking we'd just
go down the fire escape.

72
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,014
I know. I wasn't finished.

73
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,290
But don't worry!

74
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:40,457
We're gonna go down the fire escape!

75
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,540
Sh!

76
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:59,881
I'm sorry, I thought I'd make some
warm milk and it would help me sleep.

77
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,417
With a wok?

78
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,817
My boring book didn't
put you to sleep?

79
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:08,424
It got interesting.

80
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,721
Damn you, Oprah!

81
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,732
Here, let me make the milk.
I'm up anyway.

82
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,425
You know what we could do
now that we're up?

83
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,401
We could just talk
to each other all night long.

84
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,097
Like when we were first dating.
It'd be fun.

85
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:25,037
-Okay, that does sound fun.
-Yeah.

86
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:28,736
So how bummed were you
when the second sister died, huh?

87
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,881
The second sister dies?!

88
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,220
No.

89
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,060
No, I was talking
about the book I was reading.

90
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:46,357
The second sister dies in
Archie and Jughead Double Digest?

91
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:49,694
That's correct.

92
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:59,275
Want to go in the bedroom?
It's more comfortable.

93
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,207
-Sure.
-Okay.

94
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:06,081
Oh, wait, did you send
those contracts to Milan?

95
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,949
If this is your idea of sexy talk...

96
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:13,483
Did you overnight
the contracts I gave you?

97
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,648
What contracts?

98
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:18,695
Please tell me this is just one
of your jokes that I don't get.

99
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,024
Like what?

100
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,259
Like the thing when you
put the phone in your pants?

101
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,267
Tag, I'm serious.
This isn't funny.

102
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,067
Those contracts had to go out today.

103
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,267
You didn't give me any contracts.

104
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,572
Yes, I did. I put a little
Post-it on it that said:

105
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:39,649
"Must go out today," and I
underlined "today" three times.

106
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:44,346
Then I put a little heart in the
corner so I wouldn't seem too bossy.

107
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,688
You never gave them to me.

108
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:51,592
If we went to the office, you would see
those contracts sitting on your desk.

109
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:55,858
No, I'd see you looking embarrassed
because they are not on my desk.

110
00:08:56,068 --> 00:09:00,767
Maybe I'm embarrassed because you
talk on the phone with your crotch.

111
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,866
You want to go to the office now?

112
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:07,273
Come on, it's late.
We're not going down to the office.

113
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,280
Yeah, I understand. I wouldn't
want to be proved wrong either.

114
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,746
All right, get your coat!

115
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:18,981
Oh! When did you unhook this?
Nice work!

116
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:30,000
It won't go down any further.
It's stuck.

117
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,730
We'll just have to jump.

118
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,302
Now, we're gonna have
to make sure to land...

119
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,910
to the right of that
patch of ice, okay?

120
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:44,810
Not hit the dumpster
on the other side.

121
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:50,855
And try to avoid that weird
brownish-red stuff in the middle.

122
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,616
So when you get down there...

123
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:01,499
you go up to the roof
and you let me in.

124
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,093
-Wait a minute. I have to do it?
-You'll be fine.

125
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,966
It'll be just like
bungee jumping, you know?

126
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:12,338
But instead of bouncing back up,
you won't.

127
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,781
Well, what if I smack
my head on the concrete?

128
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:21,511
Well, I'm not gonna lie to you, Joey.
It's a possibility.

129
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:28,149
I don't know. Tell you what,
let's flip to see who does it.

130
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:31,330
-You call it in the air, all right?
-Oh, all right.

131
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:38,867
-Can you see what it is?
-No.

132
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:42,370
-Okay. Well, you be careful.
-No, Ross, stop it.

133
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,700
I'm not jumping.

134
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:48,039
Look, I have an audition tomorrow,
and I can't go if I break my leg.

135
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:52,843
Well, I'm not jumping. I have a son.
He won't have a father if I die.

136
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,952
So it looks like we're even.

137
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,989
Okay, so this wire...

138
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:07,163
is connected to this wire,
which plugs into here.

139
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,963
Okay, so to get the beeping to stop,
all I have to do...

140
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:14,668
Okay.

141
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,313
Well done, Phoebe.

142
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:33,014
What do you want from me?!

143
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,590
Here's your milk.
What should we talk about?

144
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,431
What? What? What?

145
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:49,097
Oh, were you sleeping, sweetie?
I'm sorry. Here.

146
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,970
Okay. Feel free to look...

147
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:59,081
but I'm telling you
those contracts are not here.

148
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,879
How could you know?
Look at this mess, Tag.

149
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:05,251
This is what I'm saying.
You have to be more organized.

150
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:09,417
You've got newspapers,
you've got magazines, you.. Oh!

151
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,363
And who's this chippy?

152
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,329
A little young for you, but whatever.

153
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:16,660
That's my sister.

154
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,503
Really? Very cute braces.

155
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,604
Anyway, you know what?
The point is, Tag, start looking...

156
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:28,075
because you're gonna find
those contracts on your desk.

157
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,715
So when do you imagine you gave
them to me? Morning or afternoon?

158
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,083
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner
came into my office after lunch...

159
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,748
he put them on my desk,
and then I put a Post-it on it...

160
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:44,854
that said:

161
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,089
"Must go out today."

162
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,936
So you just keep looking
in there, all right?

163
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,511
They're not here.

164
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,215
Puzzler.

165
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,414
Bit of a puzzle.

166
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:13,655
Why don't you check the copy room?
Maybe the contracts are in there.

167
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:16,726
-How could I have left them there?
-I don't know.

168
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,397
How can your genitals
make phone calls?

169
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,900
Okay? It's not a perfect world.
Just go, please?

170
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,737
-Fine.
-Thank you.

171
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,546
Hello?

172
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,222
I still don't get it.

173
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,625
You still awake?

174
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,863
Yeah. You?

175
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,905
You do know that was me
that just said that, right?

176
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,373
Hey.

177
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,408
As long as we're both up...

178
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,079
Yeah?

179
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:16,247
I hope you're not thinking
about cleaning the living room.

180
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,490
Man, I'm starving. What the hell
was I thinking at dinner?

181
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,257
"Do you want soup or salad?"
Both, always order both.

182
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:34,600
You know, I'm looking,
and I don't think anyone's home here.

183
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,469
I say we just break the window...

184
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:38,938
crawl through...

185
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,510
and you know, explain later.

186
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,612
-No one's home?
-I don't think so.

187
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:44,942
Hello?

188
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:54,524
So when you get in there...

189
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,798
Okay. This is where
you and I part ways.

190
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,266
Noisy bitch!

191
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,807
Oh, what? What are you doing?

192
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,476
Do you know what just happened?

193
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:22,484
Yeah. We had sex
and then we fell asleep.

194
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:27,914
No. We were in the middle of sex...

195
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,221
and you fell asleep.

196
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:35,661
No. No, that's not true.

197
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,130
No, best time ever.

198
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:42,706
Yeah. You rock my world.

199
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,502
-Monica?
-What?

200
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:51,308
I was giving you some of
my best moves, and you missed it.

201
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:56,044
So please wake up
so we can do it right.

202
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,016
Okay. Okay. I'm ready.

203
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,317
-Come on, big fella.
-Okay.

204
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,587
-Give me the good stuff.
-Yeah.

205
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:09,394
No, no, no. Don't fall asleep.

206
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,768
Okay, I'm going
to make you some coffee.

207
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:20,041
Well, I probably won't spill coffee
grounds all over the kitchen floor.

208
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,906
Okay, I'm up. I'm up.

209
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:28,380
Hi. I got you some coffee to..

210
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,881
So you got anything for me?

211
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,921
-Still no luck.
-Oh, my God.

212
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,923
You checked your entire desk
and all the drawers?

213
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,619
-Want me to check again?
-I wish you would.

214
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,563
Well, no, it's not in there.

215
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,599
How about that drawer?

216
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,903
Well, it's not out here.
Any chance it could be in your office?

217
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,813
I don't know.

218
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,716
I mean, let me check.

219
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,167
Any luck?

220
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,834
See you in my office for a minute?

221
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,641
You found them!

222
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,639
I'm not even gonna gloat.

223
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:33,113
-I'm just really relieved it's..
-You put these on my desk.

224
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:34,478
-I did not.
-Oh, really?

225
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,551
So they left your bottom drawer...

226
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:39,656
crawled across the floor,
then jumped onto my desk?

227
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,622
How did you know
they were in my bottom drawer?

228
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,430
I am so hot for you right now.

229
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:06,147
Oh, my God!
How did you get back here?

230
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,148
Phoebe Buffay?

231
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,320
Fire Alarm?

232
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:21,296
Oh, hi, Officer Fireman.
Can I help you?

233
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,400
Your fire alarm was in the trash.

234
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,430
-That's not mine.
-Yes, it is.

235
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,593
How do you know?

236
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,797
If you dump a fire alarm,
don't use a blanket that says:

237
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,977
"Property of Phoebe Buffay,
not Monica."

238
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,674
Do you have a search warrant?

239
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,339
Because the last time I checked,
this was still America.

240
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:43,478
Please reattach it.
It's illegal to disconnect them.

241
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:47,750
Fine. But please, God, tell me
how to stop it from going off?

242
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,551
Press the reset button.

243
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:53,390
There's a reset button?
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

244
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,499
Oh. There's a reset button?

245
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,726
My God!

246
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:01,234
Why didn't I see that?

247
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:05,535
Reset button. Reset button.

248
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:08,940
Where is there a reset button?
Oh, here it is! Oh!

249
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,227
-Okay, you have a good grip?
-Yeah.

250
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:33,268
I'm gonna start to climb down you now.

251
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,242
-All right, just hurry up.
-Okay.

252
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:41,879
Now, should I climb down your front
so we're face to face...

253
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,572
or should I climb down
your back so we're...

254
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,547
butt to face?

255
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:51,253
-Face to face.
-I like face to face.

256
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,959
-Okay, here I come.
-All right.

257
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,927
Oh, my.. How much do you weigh, Ross?

258
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:07,060
I prefer not to answer. I'm still
carrying a little holiday weight.

259
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,910
When we talked about face to face...

260
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,982
I don't think we thought it
all the way through.

261
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:24,453
-What do you want me to do?
-Just shimmy down me and drop.

262
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,252
-Hi.
-Hi.

263
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:36,627
You know, maybe I should hang,
and you should climb down me.

264
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:40,430
Yeah? Maybe we should talk
about that for a little while!

265
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:45,536
-It still looks pretty far.
-It's not that far. Just drop.

266
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,506
Do not rush me!

267
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,287
My pants are starting to come down,
and I'm not wearing any underwear.

268
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:08,355
My ankle! I really hurt my ankle!

269
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:12,126
I think I twisted it when..
A quarter!

270
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,777
That really was
some of your best work.

271
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:22,640
I told you.

272
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,478
I can't believe it.

273
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:31,816
I've only got two hours
until I call in sick for work.

274
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,316
I have to be up in seven minutes.

275
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,558
Well, you're not gonna believe this,
but if you have seven minutes...

276
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:41,823
Really?

277
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,767
You want to?

278
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,427
You get the vacuum cleaner.
I'll get the furniture polish.

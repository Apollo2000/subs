1
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:05,066
-Hi.
-Hi! Hi, Ben.

2
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,403
-Hi.
-We have a bathroom emergency.

3
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:08,802
Go ahead.

4
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:14,446
Before we do, are any of Joey's
special "romance" magazines in there?

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,518
-No.
-Okay, all clear.

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,578
Thanks, Phoebe.

7
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:25,313
That's Rachel.

8
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:27,591
But whatever.

9
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:31,324
Could you do me a big favor?

10
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:34,032
I have a meeting
at the dean's office.

11
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,326
Can you watch Ben for an hour?

12
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:40,164
-What about Monica?
-She isn't home.

13
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:44,399
So it would just be me alone?

14
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:47,177
Ben would be there.

15
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,182
What's the matter?

16
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,480
I've never done that before.
Me and him, alone.

17
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,355
He's not an ex-con.

18
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,755
Okay, okay...

19
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:03,860
-What do I do with him?
-I don't know, talk to him.

20
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,998
Entertain him. Keep him alive.

21
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,398
-Okay.
-Ben, come here.

22
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,697
I'm gonna leave you here with
Aunt Rachel for about an hour, okay?

23
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:15,863
Gonna be okay?

24
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:18,167
-I think so.
-I wasn't talking to you.

25
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,643
The One With The Truth About London

26
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,819
What about the second minister?
I kind of liked him.

27
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:05,080
-You mean the spitter?
-Come on. He wasn't that bad.

28
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,987
Easy for you to say,
you'd be wearing a veil.

29
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:12,622
-And the third guy?
-He kept staring at your chest.

30
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,599
Can you blame him?

31
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:18,527
I don't like the idea of
me saying, "I do"...

32
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,864
while he's thinking,
"I'd do it too."

33
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:26,034
-Well, then we still have a problem.
-With what?

34
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:30,842
We need someone to perform our wedding
but they're all boring or annoying...

35
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:33,051
or keep staring at the ladies.

36
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,490
You should have one of us do it.

37
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,819
We're getting "married" married,
not "6th-grade" married.

38
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,390
No, it's a real thing.

39
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:48,566
Anyone can be ordained on the lnternet
and perform weddings and stuff.

40
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,358
I call it!

41
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,338
What? It was my idea!

42
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:56,872
Thank you very much, but neither
of you is marrying us.

43
00:02:57,143 --> 00:03:00,010
Does calling it not mean
anything anymore?

44
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,904
We're having a legitimate
clergy member.

45
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,743
And when I say legitimate,
I mean gay...

46
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,419
and in control of his saliva.

47
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,399
Ben, you know, when you were a baby...

48
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:24,898
we'd hang out all the time.

49
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:26,934
I was your daddy's girlfriend.

50
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,368
But you're not anymore.

51
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:34,213
-No, I'm not.
-Because you guys were on a break..

52
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,574
Hey, we were not on a..

53
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:44,078
-When's my daddy coming back?
-Fifty-two minutes.

54
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,789
So no brothers or sisters, huh?

55
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:54,660
You know, I had two sisters
and we just tortured each other.

56
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:58,328
-Really? Like how?
-Well, you know, we would...

57
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,096
we'd repeat everything
the other said...

58
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:04,936
or we'd jump out of closets
to scare each other...

59
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:08,806
or switch the sugar with salt
so they put salt on their cereal.

60
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:10,408
That's a good one.

61
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,980
-Yeah, you like that one?
-Yeah, you're funny.

62
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:16,618
I'm funny?

63
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,150
Oh, thank God.

64
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,988
Well, hey, I got a ton of these.

65
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,286
You take a quarter...

66
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:28,525
and you blacken the edge, right?

67
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:32,134
And then you say,
"I bet you can't roll this quarter...

68
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,738
to your chin without it
leaving your face."

69
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:40,174
And when they do it, they're left with
a line down the center of their face.

70
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,344
Can I do it to you?

71
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,275
I'm funny, Ben, but I'm not stupid.

72
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,326
So did you find anyone
to marry you yet?

73
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:58,792
No, but "Horny for Monica" minister
called...

74
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,624
wondering if we're still together.

75
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:06,327
-We'll never find anybody.
-Then let me do it.

76
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,039
-Joey..
-I've been thinking.

77
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:11,870
I'm an actor, so I won't
get nervous in front of people.

78
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:15,569
I won't spit and I won't stare
at Monica's breasts.

79
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:19,145
Everyone knows I'm an ass man.

80
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,713
-That's true.
-The most important thing...

81
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:26,358
is, it won't be some stranger
who barely knows you.

82
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:30,221
It'll be me. And I swear,
I'll do a really good job.

83
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,866
Plus, I love you guys and it
would really mean a lot to me.

84
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,130
Might be kind of cool.

85
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,564
-So I can do it?
-Yeah, you can do it.

86
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,138
All right! Okay!

87
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,308
Okay, I gotta get started
on my speech.

88
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:46,875
Wait a minute.

89
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,075
Internet ministers
can have sex, right?

90
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,780
Coming.

91
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,694
I have a bone to pick with you.

92
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,596
-Uh-oh.
-Yes.

93
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:13,169
Ben learned a little trick.

94
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:19,209
-Oh, did he pull the old..?
-That's right, that's right.

95
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:23,410
Saran wrap on the toilet seat...

96
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:26,517
so the pee goes everywhere.

97
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,616
-Oh, that.
-Yeah, that.

98
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,220
You know I hate practical jokes.

99
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:37,361
They're mean, they're stupid and
I don't want my son learning them.

100
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,964
Saran wrap on the toilet seat?
Isn't that just a little funny?

101
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,828
-I was barefoot.
-Oh.

102
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:49,465
Tell me, the toilet thing is the
only thing you taught him, right?

103
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,637
Yes.

104
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:01,180
-Hey.
-Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani.

105
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,552
-You got ordained?
-Yeah.

106
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:07,384
Just got off the lnternet.
Man, there's a lot of porn out there.

107
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:10,952
Our minister.

108
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:15,025
I started on what I'm gonna say
for the ceremony. Want to hear it?

109
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:18,397
Listen, this is just
the first draft, so...

110
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:22,568
"We are gathered here today
on this joyous occasion...

111
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:26,710
to celebrate the special love
that Monica and Chandler share.

112
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:32,776
It is a love based on
giving and receiving...

113
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,612
as well as having and sharing.

114
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:40,849
And the love that they give
and have is shared and received.

115
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:45,693
And through this having and giving...

116
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,765
and sharing and receiving...

117
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:54,873
we too can share and love
and have...

118
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,408
and receive."

119
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,404
Should we call the spitter?

120
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,150
-Hey, Rachel.
-Hi.

121
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,826
What a surprise.
What are you doing here?

122
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:19,053
I was just in the neighborhood...

123
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:23,132
and I passed by your building and
thought, "What's up with Carol...

124
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,896
and sweet little Ben?"

125
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:28,564
-That's nice. Well, come on in.
-Okay.

126
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:31,038
I'll make some coffee
and we can chat.

127
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,108
I'd love that.
I would love that.

128
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,813
So where is sweet little Ben?

129
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,177
I would love to have a little..

130
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,316
I found him!

131
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,259
Very funny. Come here.

132
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:52,286
That is exactly why I've
come here to talk to you, okay?

133
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,999
-Rachel, you want sugar?
-Yes, but..

134
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,202
Do I want sugar in my coffee?

135
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,507
No, just some milk would
be good, Carol. Thanks.

136
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,643
Remember all that stuff
I taught you yesterday?

137
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,871
"Remember all that stuff
I taught you yesterday?"

138
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,377
-Don't do that.
-"Don't do that."

139
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:16,520
-Your dad doesn't like pranks.
-"Your dad doesn't like pranks."

140
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:19,080
-Oh, damn it.
-"Oh, damn it!"

141
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,849
No! Don't say that.

142
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,188
-Damn it!
-Go back to repeating.

143
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:24,952
-Damn it!
-Oh, crap.

144
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:26,323
"Oh, crap!"

145
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:36,298
Okay, I got some more written, ready?

146
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,642
Yeah, okay.

147
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:44,672
"When I think of the love that these
two givers and receivers share...

148
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:49,850
I can't help but envy the lifetime
ahead of having and loving...

149
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:54,320
and giving.." And then I can't
think of a good word for right here.

150
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,358
-How about "receiving"?
-Yes!

151
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:02,968
See, Joe, not that that's not great...

152
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:07,869
but one cool thing about having
a friend perform the ceremony...

153
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,801
is that it can be about us.

154
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:13,500
It can be more personal.
You can tell stories about us.

155
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:19,381
Okay! Maybe I'll talk about London,
when you hooked up.

156
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:22,212
Only I won't say "hooked up"...

157
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,515
I'll say, "began their
beautiful journey...

158
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,249
-There you go.
-by doing it."

159
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,254
-Joe.
-Okay, all right.

160
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,232
So how did it happen?
Did your eyes meet across the room...

161
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:41,064
then you're in the bathtub
and she's feeding you strawberries?

162
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,769
-Isn't that what happened to you?
-Yeah!

163
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,578
I call that "London style."

164
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:53,578
That didn't happen with us.

165
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:57,619
Maybe you should say it is,
because "London style" sounds nice.

166
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,786
Okay, uh...

167
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:05,721
I was sad that night because
this guy thought I was Ross' mom.

168
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:10,591
And Chandler was really sweet
and he consoled me and...

169
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,532
-we drank too much.
-Yeah, baby.

170
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:20,542
I was a gentleman and I walked her to
her hotel room and said good night.

171
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,069
Oh.

172
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,815
-But then, later that night..
-Yeah, baby.

173
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:39,823
Cute P.J.s. Really living it up
here in London, huh?

174
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,259
Well, I wasn't exactly
expecting company after...

175
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,767
9:15.

176
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:49,969
Is Joey here?

177
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:54,645
Last I saw he was with a bridesmaid
and a bucket of strawberries.

178
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:59,183
You're not still upset about
what that guy told you, are you?

179
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,583
Wouldn't you be?

180
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:05,923
It's been a really emotional time
and you've had a lot to drink...

181
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,820
You have to let that go, okay?

182
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:11,120
You were the most beautiful
woman in the room tonight.

183
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,153
Really?

184
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:16,959
You kidding? You're the most
beautiful woman in most rooms..

185
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,235
Whoa, what's going on?

186
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:27,367
We just made out.

187
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,843
-We're making out?
-Not anymore.

188
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:34,482
-But we don't do that.
-I know, I thought it would be fun.

189
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:36,777
How drunk are you?

190
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:42,016
Enough to know I want to do this. Not
so much that you should feel guilty.

191
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,026
That's the perfect amount.

192
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,033
-You know what's weird?
-What?

193
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,638
-This doesn't feel weird.
-I know.

194
00:12:56,876 --> 00:13:01,176
-You're a really good kisser.
-Well, I have kissed over four women.

195
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:06,040
Want to get under the covers?
Okay.

196
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,319
Wow, you are really fast!

197
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,691
It bodes well for me
that speed impresses you.

198
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,734
-We're gonna see each other naked.
-Yep.

199
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,131
-At the same time?
-Count of three?

200
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:31,207
One, two, three.

201
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:39,850
Well, I think it's safe to say
our friendship is effectively ruined.

202
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,053
Eh, we weren't that close anyway.

203
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,288
Joey, Joey, Joey!

204
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:51,351
Hey.

205
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,963
Hey, Joe.
I was just watching a movie...

206
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,397
Oh, dude, I'm so sorry.

207
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:02,897
No!

208
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,809
It's cool, I'm still
with my bridesmaid.

209
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,603
Where are the condoms?

210
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,713
In my bag over there.

211
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,221
Could you leave me one?

212
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,549
For just you?

213
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,123
Yeah.

214
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,735
All right. There you go, buddy.

215
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:32,768
Go nuts.

216
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,475
That's what that was?

217
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:42,607
If I hadn't left you one, you two
might've never gotten together.

218
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:46,517
Imagine if I had sent that hooker
like I was gonna?

219
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,954
It's like it was in the stars.

220
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:52,913
Yeah, totally meant to be.

221
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:56,650
Tell him who you originally
wanted to hook up with that night.

222
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,363
-What?
-What?

223
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,126
What?

224
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,964
Who did you originally
want to hook up with?

225
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,740
Okay, fine, but please don't be upset.

226
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:14,174
I was really depressed, okay?
And really drunk.

227
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:18,883
I wanted something stupid and
meaningless. I just wanted sex.

228
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,252
So, when I went to your
room that night...

229
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:25,787
I was actually looking for Joey.

230
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,030
Yeah, baby.

231
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,696
No, baby.

232
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,400
Oh, my God.

233
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,470
You came looking for Joey?

234
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:47,008
-Were you planning on telling me this?
-No, I didn't think it was important.

235
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,973
It's not important?
It's not important?

236
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:53,184
If it wasn't for a bridesmaid,
you'd be marrying him.

237
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:58,152
Do you know how unbelievably
glad I am that Joey wasn't there?

238
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,358
Hey!

239
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,194
I'm a man of the cloth
but I still have feelings.

240
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:09,394
There's no way you're
doing this wedding now, okay?

241
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:13,230
What? That's not fair.
It's not my fault.

242
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,029
I was with my bridesmaid.

243
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,333
And who's to say
I would've said yes?

244
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,704
I mean, I would've said yes.

245
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,015
You are making way too
big a deal out of this.

246
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,843
Everything worked out okay.

247
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,450
It's just weird, okay?

248
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,918
I don't want to be saying my vows with
the mental image of you and Monica.

249
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:35,024
I need.. I don't know what I need.
I need a walk.

250
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,821
-Wait, Chandler, it's not a big deal.
-It is to me.

251
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:42,330
You wanted to sleep with Batman
and settled for Robin.

252
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,070
-This is crazy.
-No, Robin is so gay.

253
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:57,105
-So now what have we agreed?
-No more pranks.

254
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,913
-What else?
-You and Daddy were not on a break.

255
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,279
Very good.

256
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:08,724
Rachel, what are you doing here?

257
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:12,092
I'm just visiting
my good friend Carol.

258
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,963
-Your good friend?
-Yeah.

259
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,932
What's her last name?

260
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,802
Carol...

261
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,099
-Lesbian.
-Nice.

262
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:29,144
By the way, that line down my face...

263
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:34,748
The line that prompted a student
in my last class of the day to say:

264
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:38,388
"Dude, don't you ever wash your face?"

265
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,992
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

266
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:45,490
I don't want you teaching my son
that stuff anymore.

267
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:47,693
-Okay?
-Fine. Fine.

268
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:51,664
Once I taught him that stuff,
he called me "fun Aunt Rachel."

269
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,929
And I loved being fun Aunt Rachel.

270
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:58,273
I'm glad you guys were bonding but..

271
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,604
Look, he doesn't have any siblings.

272
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,144
Somebody has to teach him this stuff.

273
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:07,146
I haven't taught him anything
a normal 6-year-old doesn't know.

274
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,444
-Crap!
-I gotta go.

275
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,526
-Hey.
-Hey.

276
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:22,233
You want this scone? It came for me
but it would rather sleep with you.

277
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,360
Nothing even happened.

278
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,237
I just don't want you to be upset.

279
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,237
How can I not be upset?

280
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,570
I finally fall in love
with this fantastic woman...

281
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,008
and it turns out
she wanted you first.

282
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:40,184
Yeah, for like a half an hour
one night.

283
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:44,383
Chandler, she wants you
for the rest of her life.

284
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,518
We look at you and we
see you together, and it just...

285
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:52,391
it fits, you know?

286
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:56,164
And you just know
it's gonna last forever.

287
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,172
That's what you should say.

288
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,669
What?

289
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:09,711
When you're marrying us,
that's what you should say.

290
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,613
Really? I could do it?

291
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,116
I'd love you to do it.

292
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,421
Hey.

293
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:24,556
But those are the words.
Those exact words.

294
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:28,055
Well, I don't remember exactly but...

295
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:34,265
it's pretty much about having
and giving and sharing and receiving.

296
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,272
-So you guys doing okay?
-Yeah.

297
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,316
We talked and Monica made me
see that I overreacted a little bit.

298
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:52,520
-Some things are more important.
-Yeah, baby.

299
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:59,094
I'm really glad you guys are okay,
but I just keep thinking...

300
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,528
what would've happened
if you two had hooked up.

301
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,401
Honey, dinner's ready!

302
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,936
What's my little chef
got for me tonight?

303
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,546
-Your favorite.
-Ho, ho, ho...

304
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,311
fried stuff with cheese.

305
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,612
And lots of it!

306
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:26,488
Thanks, sweetheart.

307
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,449
Give me a little sugar...

308
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:34,629
Here we go, here we go, here we go.

309
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,863
How you doing?

310
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,446
-Hey.
-Hey!

311
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:54,311
I'm sorry to do this again, but
could you look after Ben for a bit?

312
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,214
I've got this meeting at school...

313
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,424
and he asked for his
fun Aunt Rachel.

314
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,324
Well, of course I will watch him.

315
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,562
We have fun, don't we, Ben?

316
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,992
-See you later, pal.
-Okay.

317
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,230
Wait a minute. Ben, I can't do it.

318
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,802
-You got something on your back.
-What?

319
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,440
That's great. That is great.

320
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:22,079
What did we just finish
talking about, Ben?

321
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:25,181
"What did we just finish
talking about, Ben?"

322
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,475
That's it! Come here!

323
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:30,278
-You're in big trouble, young man!
-No, wait.

324
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,648
Ben, come here! I am not kidding!

325
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:35,085
You guys, hold it. Seriously..

326
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,821
Oh, my God!

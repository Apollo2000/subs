{100}{183}Do you realize we're|getting married in four weeks?
{189}{260}Four weeks, baby. Four weeks!
{274}{330}You realize you get louder each week?
{353}{439}There's still so much to do!|Have you written your vows?
{444}{553}I figured I'd just buy those.|"Pat, I'd like to buy a vow. "
{569}{652}You know I've no sense of humor|when it comes to this.
{687}{804}- Right. Have you written yours yet?|- No, but I know what I'm gonna say.
{827}{900}Do you happen to know|what I'm gonna say?
{948}{1006}Let's do it now. It won't be hard.
{1012}{1057}Say what's in your heart.
{1218}{1306}{Y:i}Look at her go. She must|love me more than I love her! 
{1323}{1423}{Y:i}What's wrong with me? |Oh, don 't open that door.

{2438}{2548}"Monica, there are no words..."
{2607}{2686}There are no words!|This shouldn't be this hard!
{2712}{2808}You've done this before.|What did you say in your vows?
{2814}{2919}With Carol I promised never|to love another woman until I die.
{2925}{2968}She made no such promise.
{2990}{3099}I'm pathetic. Monica knows what|to say, you should have seen her.
{3170}{3211}What's the emergency?
{3217}{3311}You have to help me write my vows.|All I have is this.
{3317}{3406}I like the pretty drawing|of you in the wedding dress.
{3429}{3528}- Thank you.|- Except your breasts look small.
{3554}{3608}Those are my eyes!
{3649}{3737}- Those are my breasts.|- Oh, yeah.
{3803}{3883}Why don't you start|with something simple?
{3889}{4014}"Monica, from the moment I met you|I knew I loved you. "
{4020}{4058}I can't do that.
{4064}{4124}Everyone, this is Chandler.
{4129}{4178}Hi, I'm Ross' little sister.
{4197}{4233}Okay.
{4293}{4371}Okay, okay.|Maybe you could start with:
{4376}{4444}"Chandler, even though|we were friends...
{4450}{4530}...there was a part of me|that knew I wanted more. "
{4535}{4649}All right, there's a nuclear|holocaust. I'm the last man on Earth.
{4654}{4703}Would you go out with me?
{4825}{4883}Are we allowed to lie in the vows?
{4917}{5023}Okay, don't talk about those feelings.|Just say something about...
{5028}{5103}...all the things|he's taught you, like...
{5248}{5306}Or all the things you taught him.
{5325}{5419}Everybody knows the erogenous zones.|One, two, three...
{5437}{5549}...four, five, six and seven.
{5554}{5598}There are seven?
{5662}{5748}- That's one?|- Kind of an important one.
{5768}{5822}I was looking at it upside down.
{5892}{5953}You know, sometimes that helps.
{6062}{6139}Okay, start out with a little one...
{6145}{6212}...a two, a one-two-three...
{6237}{6318}...a three, a five...
{6345}{6409}...a four, a three-two...
{6415}{6464}...two, a two-four-six.
{6491}{6575}Two-four-six, four, two...
{6580}{6643}...two, four-seven...
{6673}{6733}...five-seven, six-seven...
{6739}{6799}...seven, seven...
{6805}{6884}...seven, seven, seven...
{6889}{6923}...seven!
{7135}{7186}How about something like:
{7192}{7303}"Monica, when I look back|over our time together... . "
{7418}{7464}- Yeah?|- I can't do all of it.
{7470}{7525}Look back over your time together.
{7599}{7639}Oh, look, twins!
{7645}{7733}No fair! I don't even have one,|how come they get two?
{7745}{7808}- You'll get one.|- Yeah, when?
{7814}{7904}When we're 40,|if neither of us are married...
{7925}{8024}...what do you say we have one?|- Why wouldn't I be married?
{8054}{8104}I just meant hypothetically.
{8109}{8181}Hypothetically,|why won't I be married?
{8186}{8213}No, no.
{8218}{8304}What is it? Is there|something unmarriable about me?
{8346}{8383}Well?
{8390}{8468}Dear God, this parachute|is a knapsack!
{8527}{8579}I'm getting married today!
{8642}{8683}Think he knew I was here?
{8864}{8889}Nice try.
{8894}{8938}Wait, wait, wait.
{9010}{9038}Look, Monica...
{9146}{9228}- This is not gonna work.|- I bet this'll work.
{9429}{9493}You are so great! I love you.
{9725}{9756}What?
{9762}{9851}I said you're so great,|and then I stopped talking.
{9905}{9982}- You said you love me!|- No, I didn't.
{10028}{10085}- Yes, you did.|- No, I didn't!
{10111}{10172}- You love me!|- No, I don't!
{10177}{10219}Stop it! Stop it!
{10322}{10418}You know, I was thinking,|what if I unpack here?
{10423}{10480}Then all your stuff would be here.
{10520}{10553}Well... .
{10617}{10658}What if it was here?
{10675}{10748}Then you'd be going back|and forth all the time.
{10762}{10798}Doesn't make any sense.
{10810}{10848}Okay.
{10901}{10998}What if we live together,|and you understand what I'm saying?
{11211}{11257}We wanted to surprise you.
{11507}{11544}Oh, my God!
{11700}{11738}Chandler...
{11773}{11813}...in all my life...
{11834}{11898}...I never thought I'd be so lucky...
{11982}{12068}...as to fall in love with my best...
{12103}{12201}My best... There's a reason|why girls don't do this!
{12206}{12257}Okay, okay, okay! I'll do it.
{12285}{12328}I thought...
{12431}{12467}I can do this.
{12560}{12598}I thought...
{12603}{12728}...that it mattered what I said|or where I said it.
{12743}{12868}Then I realized the only thing|that matters is that you...
{12966}{13068}You make me happier|than I ever thought I could be.
{13140}{13185}And if you let me...
{13190}{13303}...I'll spend the rest of my life|trying to make you feel the same way.
{13520}{13556}Monica?
{13603}{13639}Will you marry me?
{13692}{13733}Yes.
{14045}{14107}Can we come in?|We're dying out here!
{14135}{14173}Come in! Come in!
{14213}{14258}- We're engaged!|- Yes!
{14515}{14591}- Hi.|- What have you guys been up to?
{14596}{14676}Helping Chandler write his vows.|He kicked us out.
{14681}{14747}Joey kept making|inappropriate suggestions.
{14795}{14888}How is "Monica, I love|your sweet ass" inappropriate?
{14933}{14971}How's Monica doing?
{14976}{15070}Lucky she's got a sweet ass.|She's not so good at writing.
{15104}{15171}In four weeks|they're gonna be married!
{15179}{15228}Let's just hope it works.
{15233}{15299}Nine out of 10 marriages|end in divorce.
{15304}{15340}That's not true.
{15345}{15398}You're right. How's the missis?
{15444}{15470}I can't believe...
{15475}{15531}...they're together 3 years.|- That long?
{15536}{15619}It seems like less|because they hid it from us.
{15647}{15708}Hey, it's me. Coming in.
{15865}{15928}I've had a very long, hard day.
{15944}{16030}- I'm getting some chicken. Want some?|- No. Bye, then.
{16147}{16233}He wouldn't leave.|He kept asking if I wanted chicken.
{16264}{16294}Chicken?
{16322}{16363}I could eat some chicken.
{16398}{16433}Hey, Joe!
{16496}{16590}Can I get a three-piece,|coleslaw, beans and a Coke?
{16613}{16648}Diet Coke.
{16749}{16848}- Why didn't they tell us?|- I know, we were cool about it.
{16854}{16923}You? And you?
{16945}{17002}You cannot tell. No one knows.
{17007}{17051}How? When?
{17062}{17118}- It happened in London.|- In London?!
{17188}{17274}We didn't want to make|a big deal out of it.
{17279}{17333}But it is a big deal!
{17344}{17403}- I have to tell someone.|- No, no!
{17414}{17451}- You can't.|- Please!
{17457}{17573}We don't want to deal with telling|them. Just promise you won't tell.
{17659}{17691}All right!
{17708}{17814}{Y:i}I can 't wait to be with you. |I'll tell Rachel I'm doing laundry. 
{17820}{17888}{Y:i}Laundry? Is that my new nickname? 
{18000}{18064}{Y:i}You know your nickname, Mr. Big... 
{18102}{18224}Oh, look, there's Monica and Chandler.|Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey!
{18478}{18529}Chandler and Monica!
{18535}{18573}Oh, my God!
{18579}{18648}- Chandler and Monica!|- Oh, my God!
{18655}{18741}- Oh, my eyes! My eyes!|- Phoebe! Phoebe!
{18747}{18834}- It's okay! It's okay!|- No! They're doing it!
{18839}{18868}I know! I know!
{18874}{18904}- You know?|- Yes!
{18909}{18985}And Joey, but Ross doesn't,|so stop screaming!
{19004}{19058}- Hey, what's going on?|- Oh, hi!
{19097}{19129}What? What?
{19135}{19207}We're excited that you|might get this place!
{19220}{19322}- Actually, it looks really good.|- It looks pretty good!
{19327}{19393}Get in here! Come on!
{19464}{19523}So they don't know|that Rachel knows?
{19552}{19623}Yes, but it doesn't matter|who knows what.
{19629}{19708}Enough of us know.|We can just tell them we know.
{19714}{19782}The lying and the secrets|will be over.
{19787}{19898}Or, we can not tell them we know|and have a little fun of our own.
{19918}{19992}We better go if we're gonna|catch that movie.
{19997}{20039}- Bye.|- Bye.
{20044}{20108}Bye, Chandler. I miss you already.
{20235}{20304}Did you see|the inappropriate pinching?
{20309}{20336}Actually, I did.
{20341}{20423}So now do you believe|that she's attracted to me?
{20454}{20523}Oh, my God!|My God, she knows about us!
{20529}{20611}- Phoebe knows about us!|- I didn't tell them.
{20620}{20685}Them? Who's them?
{20715}{20776}Phoebe and Joey.
{20820}{20850}Joey!
{20859}{20889}And Rachel.
{20899}{20966}They made me promise not to tell.
{20971}{21053}They think they are so slick,|messing with us!
{21059}{21133}They don't know that we know|that they know.
{21167}{21213}- So... .|- Ah, yes!
{21219}{21288}The messers become the messees!
{21314}{21398}My God, he wants me to come|over and feel his biceps!
{21424}{21453}Are you kidding?
{21458}{21518}I can't believe he'd do that to Mo...
{21732}{21794}Joey? Do they know that we know?
{21808}{21859}- No.|- Joey!
{21864}{21928}- They know you know.|- I knew it!
{21951}{22002}I cannot believe those two!
{22007}{22093}They thought that they could|mess with us? With us?
{22153}{22236}They don't know that we know|they know we know.
{22268}{22314}Joey, you can't say anything.
{22319}{22365}Couldn't if I wanted to.
{22414}{22483}She wants me to put lotion on her!
{22489}{22523}She's bluffing!
{22528}{22598}She's not backing down.|She went like this.
{22659}{22740}He's not backing down.|He went to get lotion.
{22795}{22842}Aren't you guys done yet?
{22847}{22957}The sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler|the sooner this is all over.
{22975}{23008}- I like that.|- Okay.
{23014}{23128}Okay, show him your bra.|He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.
{23308}{23368}Wow! You didn't rip off|any buttons.
{23374}{23412}It's not my first time.
{23469}{23529}You go seduce her until she cracks.
{23535}{23578}Okay, give me a second.
{23598}{23668}- Did you clean up in here?|- Of course.
{23809}{23839}Oh, you're going?
{23849}{23898}Not without you, lover.
{24020}{24095}So, this is my bra.
{24183}{24233}It's very, very nice.
{24285}{24346}Well, come here.
{24351}{24415}I'm happy we're gonna|have all the sex.
{24460}{24535}You should be. I'm very bendy.
{24654}{24731}- I'm gonna kiss you.|- Not if I kiss you first.
{25217}{25287}There's nothing left|for us to do but kiss.
{25308}{25353}Here it comes.
{25379}{25415}Our first kiss.
{25633}{25713}- Okay, okay, okay, fine, you win!|- Ha!
{25719}{25760}- I can't have sex.|- Why not?
{25765}{25831}- I'm in love with Monica.|- You're what?
{25894}{26013}Love her! That's right, I love her!|I love her!
{26125}{26168}I love you, Monica.
{26190}{26243}I love you too, Chandler.
{26375}{26475}I thought you guys were doing it,|I didn't know you were in love.
{26506}{26567}That's it, it's over.|Everybody knows.
{26572}{26668}- Well, Ross doesn't.|- We'd like it if no one told him yet.
{26674}{26708}No.
{26764}{26818}What are you doing?
{26835}{26903}Get off my sister!
{26958}{27039}Friends getting married,|it's gotta change things.
{27045}{27084}Think it'll be different?
{27090}{27163}How can it not be?|They're gonna have kids...
{27169}{27249}...and hang out with other couples|who have kids.
{27255}{27315}And maybe they'll leave the city...
{27320}{27388}...to be near a Volvo dealership.
{27454}{27495}Things change.
{27500}{27577}I don't want them|to move to a Volvo dealership.
{27617}{27651}It'll be okay, Joe.
{27670}{27754}Sorry. I just...|I like things the way they are.
{27770}{27819}Who's this little naked guy?
{27825}{27874}That naked guy would be me.
{27912}{27953}Look at the little thing.
{27959}{27993}Yes.
{28023}{28126}Yes, fine, that is my penis.|Can we be grownups now?
{28165}{28225}- Who are those people?|- Got me.
{28230}{28283}Oh, that's Nana right there.
{28289}{28348}- Wow.|- Let's see.
{28353}{28417}"Me and the gang at Java Joe's. "
{28422}{28507}Monica, you look like your grandma.|How old was she?
{28520}{28558}Let's see, 1939.
{28563}{28613}Yeah, 24, 25.
{28647}{28688}Looks like a fun gang.
{28830}{28908}Look, look, look!|I got Monica naked.
{28914}{28957}Let me see.
{28998}{29043}No, that would be me again.
{29176}{29244}- Hey, you guys.|- What's going on?
{29249}{29308}Well, we were just talking about...
{29313}{29391}...you guys getting married|and how great it is.
{29396}{29493}Yeah, you can get a Volvo.|If that's what you really want.
{29523}{29557}That's so sweet.
{29590}{29680}- So, we both finished our vows.|- Can we read them?
{29685}{29773}As long as I don't hear his|and he doesn't hear mine.
{29990}{30038}Oh, that's beautiful.
{30072}{30106}Funny one! Good!
{30159}{30195}Will you marry me?
{30265}{30309}What? I don't get it.
{30319}{30358}Oh, yeah!
{30422}{30485}- Man, this is hilarious!|- Chandler!
{30515}{30578}Don't worry, we'll make yours funnier.
{30747}{30793}Okay, what do you think?
{30850}{30958}- Dude... .|- I have never known love like this.
{30978}{31039}- You really like it?|- Dude!
{31075}{31116}How did you write this?
{31121}{31183}I stole Monica's|and changed the name.
{31242}{31323}- You can't do that!|- Lf he goes first he can!

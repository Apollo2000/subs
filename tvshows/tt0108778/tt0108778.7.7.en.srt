1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,201
-Morning.
-Hi.

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,196
How was your date?

3
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:09,766
-Pretty good.
-Oh, good.

4
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:14,273
My God. Sorry about that.

5
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:17,477
Okay, really good.

6
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:19,542
I gotta go. I'm late.

7
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:21,812
You're going to leave
her with me?

8
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:24,080
Don't worry,
she's a terrific girl.

9
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:25,689
Can you do me a favor?

10
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:30,419
Could you mention I'm not looking
for a relationship? That'd be great.

11
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,462
What, are you kidding?

12
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:36,033
Just casually slip it in, you know.
Lay the groundwork.

13
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:39,534
Tell her I'm a loner.
No, an outlaw.

14
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:42,867
She doesn't want to get mixed up
with the likes of me.

15
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,441
That's a lot to remember.

16
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,838
Can't I tell her that you're a pig?

17
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,777
I'm gonna call her later myself.

18
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,244
Honest.

19
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:54,544
Chandler used to do it.
He'd make her pancakes.

20
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:57,450
He'd make extras
and leave them for me.

21
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:01,222
I'm not telling her anything.
It's not my responsibility.

22
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,723
Fine.

23
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,431
Now, where did we land
on those pancakes?

24
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:11,463
-Hi.
-Hi.

25
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:14,901
Sorry, but I couldn't get
that lock to work.

26
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:18,202
Yeah, Joey kind of disabled it
when I moved in.

27
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,575
-You must be Rachel. I'm Erin.
-Hi.

28
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:26,776
I don't mean this to sound like high
school, but did he talk about me?

29
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,147
Would you like some pancakes?

30
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,953
The One With Ross's Library Book

31
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,168
-Come on. Why are we here?
-Okay, okay, take a guess.

32
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,139
The hot chicks?

33
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,801
Okay, okay, I was typing names
into the library computer earlier...

34
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,239
you know, for fun.

35
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:30,677
And I typed mine in,
and guess what came up?

36
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,781
My doctoral dissertation.

37
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:37,080
It's right down here in the biggest
library in the university.

38
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,950
Wow, that's actually pretty cool.

39
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:44,588
There's also a book here
by a woman named Wendy Bagina.

40
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,198
What is that?

41
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:53,969
Sounds like two people are really
enjoying the Dewey decimal system.

42
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:01,077
We're so sorry.

43
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,112
You didn't bring me here to do that,
did you?

44
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,489
She sent the chicken back again?

45
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:19,925
She said it's too dry and wants
to explain to you how she wants it.

46
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,464
I'd like to meet this chicken expert.

47
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,465
Send the colonel in.

48
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:33,239
Oh, my God!

49
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,807
Lucky bastard.

50
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,384
-Janice.
-How are you...

51
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:45,718
Ms. Hotshot-Chef-at-the-Big-Fancy-
Restaurant-With-the-Best-Chicken-Ever?

52
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,153
I'm fine.

53
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:53,821
Oh, what is that on your finger?
I'm blind.

54
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:59,198
So who's the lucky guy?

55
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:04,434
Oh, my God.

56
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,011
I am so sorry, sweetie.

57
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:10,148
Are you okay?

58
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,082
You didn't tell her we're engaged?

59
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,810
-She saw the ring.
-Did she freak out?

60
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:19,253
She was shocked,
but then again, so were most people.

61
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,855
She actually has a boyfriend herself.

62
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,561
Name's Clark.

63
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,728
She also invited herself
to our wedding.

64
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,367
Clark too.

65
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:33,835
You said no, right?

66
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,003
You said no, right?

67
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:43,341
She cornered me. She asked me
if the wedding was in town.

68
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,517
-What was I supposed to do?
-Lie.

69
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,251
How hard is that?
"Your check's in the mail."

70
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,854
"Oh, your baby's so cute."

71
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:56,024
"I can't wait to read your book, Ross."

72
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,998
So she comes to the wedding.
Maybe it won't be so bad.

73
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,034
Think she'll sit quietly?
Think she'll want to make a toast?

74
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:09,037
You don't think she'll want
to sing "Part-Time Lover"?

75
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:13,542
Oh, my God. She's not gonna like
the chicken either, is she?

76
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,581
You know what? It'll be okay.

77
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,378
She's probably not gonna even
want to come.

78
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:25,022
-Really?
-No, that was a lie.

79
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,550
See how easy that was?

80
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,295
So you would have just lied?

81
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:32,929
Yes.

82
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:37,100
-It would have really been that easy?
-Yes.

83
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:40,397
Do it Saturday. We're having
dinner with her and Clark.

84
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,804
Hey, what's up?

85
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,416
Hey, who's your friend?

86
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,586
-Hey, Joey.
-Erin.

87
00:05:58,658 --> 00:05:59,955
You're still here.

88
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:05,588
We ended up spending the day together
and had such a great time.

89
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:08,596
Why wouldn't you? Erin is great.

90
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:11,133
And then there's you guys.

91
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,704
Well, listen, I better get going.

92
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,306
Today was great. Thanks.

93
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,278
And Joey, last night was fun.

94
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,846
Yeah. I'll call you.

95
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,982
-I'll call you too.
-Or I'll call you.

96
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,845
-And call me.
-Okay.

97
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,086
Good to see you again.

98
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,119
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

99
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,885
The system kind of broke down, huh?

100
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:40,390
Joey, I'm sorry. I just couldn't
tell her all those things.

101
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,396
And we got to talking, and I..

102
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,636
We want you to marry her.

103
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:46,629
What?

104
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,330
She is so amazing. You have no idea.

105
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,407
Who do you think brought her here?

106
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,008
Cupid.

107
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,682
She's so cool.
She speaks four languages.

108
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,717
Man, do you know what guys want.

109
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:07,390
Come on, she's so perfect for you.
She's sweet.

110
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,925
She likes baseball.
She had two beers at lunch.

111
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,688
My beers?!

112
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,164
Look, she's a very nice girl.

113
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:19,395
We had a very good time,
but I don't see it going anywhere.

114
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,038
You always say that.

115
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,141
Maybe if you gave her a chance,
it would go somewhere.

116
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,141
I'm sorry, you guys.
I just don't think so.

117
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,577
-Whatever.
-Fine.

118
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,649
Hey, don't start judging me.

119
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,784
You're in love with your assistant.

120
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:38,754
You're sleeping with the guy
who keeps pigeons on the roof.

121
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,953
Phoebe!

122
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,251
Secret affair.

123
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:55,972
People are doing it
in front of my book.

124
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,299
I'm sorry?

125
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:03,215
My doctoral dissertation is in the
library at school. I went to see it.

126
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:08,680
And there were students making babies
right in the paleontology section.

127
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:12,752
Oh, my God.
Did you get to see anything good?

128
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,188
At your school...

129
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:20,491
was there a place on campus
where students went to fool around?

130
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,959
Yeah, there was.

131
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:26,695
In the corner of the library where all
the books were that nobody ever read.

132
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,998
Yes, there was.

133
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:33,401
Great, because people kept showing up.
I think it's like a thing.

134
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,303
Hold on a second.

135
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:38,516
Fifth floor, against that back wall?

136
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,585
Oh, for crying out loud!

137
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,316
-So we should go catch our movie.
-What's the rush?

138
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:51,256
I'd like to see the previews.

139
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,756
The candy.

140
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:58,468
-Oh, hey.
-Well, look who's here.

141
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,228
-Hey, Joey.
-Hey, Erin.

142
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:01,667
-Hey, Rachel.
-Hi.

143
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,502
We were about to take off
and see a movie.

144
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:08,308
-Oh, no!
-What's wrong?

145
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:12,746
Phoebe, we forgot that party
we have to go to.

146
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,817
Oh, no.

147
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:16,845
What party?

148
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,987
A birthday party.

149
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,525
Whose birthday party?

150
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,956
Alison's birthday party.

151
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,796
And how old is Alison?

152
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,433
Thirty-two.

153
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:36,264
Wait a minute.
Why don't you guys do something?

154
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,966
Look how that worked out.

155
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:47,284
Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here.

156
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:52,320
Do you know the paleontology section,
fifth floor, stack 437?

157
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:55,425
Well, yes.
Just give me five minutes.

158
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:58,721
I just have to find someone
to cover my shift.

159
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:04,168
No, no, no.

160
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,428
Can I speak to someone in charge?

161
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:11,231
How can I help?

162
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,902
Hi, I was wondering, is it possible
to increase security...

163
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:17,081
in the paleontology section?

164
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,978
I wrote a book that's up there.

165
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,583
And instead of reading it,
people are...

166
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,949
Well, they're rolling around
in front of it.

167
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:29,357
We are aware of the problem
you're referring to.

168
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,830
As far as increasing security,
I'm afraid the library's understaffed.

169
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,504
I can't help you.

170
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,338
Well, fine.

171
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:45,441
If I'm the only person
with any appreciation...

172
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,479
of the sanctity of the written
word, then I'll go defend it myself.

173
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,107
Don't you follow me.

174
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,948
-How did it go with Erin?
-Unbelievable.

175
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,160
We had the best time.

176
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,958
-So you're not mad anymore?
-No, no. You guys were totally right.

177
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,363
This was much better than
the first date.

178
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,127
It was awkward.
We were both nervous.

179
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:15,431
-Didn't you sleep together?
-Yeah, that calms me down.

180
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,441
And we have so much in common.

181
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:24,810
She loves sandwiches, sports.
Although she is a Met fan.

182
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,980
Not an issue now,
but if we had kids...

183
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,122
Oh, my God! Listen to you talking
about having kids.

184
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:35,656
Oh, my Joey.

185
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,159
Please don't get married before I do.

186
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,133
I just cannot believe
that Clark stood me up.

187
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,835
He may still show up.

188
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,304
What are you, stupid?

189
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:56,103
-It's been three hours.
-Is that all?

190
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,678
Let's go on to happier things.

191
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,411
Why don't you tell me
about your lovely wedding.

192
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:08,423
There was something that we wanted
to tell you about the wedding.

193
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,925
It's going to be a small ceremony.

194
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,825
Tiny.

195
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,767
We're not even sure
why we're having it.

196
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,667
It's actually going to be just family.

197
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:26,333
Oh, wait.

198
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:30,206
You two think of me as family?

199
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,184
I have to ask you something now,
and be honest.

200
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:42,019
Do you want me to sing
"Careless Whisper" or "Lady in Red"?

201
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,661
How can you say that?
The Mets have no closer.

202
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,165
-What about Benitez?
-What about game one of the series?

203
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,871
-What about shut up?
-You shut up.

204
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,800
I love arguing with her.

205
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,873
-Be right back.
-Okay.

206
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,910
How's it going with Joey?

207
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,082
Oh, okay.

208
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,715
Okay?

209
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:09,911
Tell me that you like him, please.
I mean, tell me that you like him.

210
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:14,486
He's a really great guy, and I know
you really want this to work out...

211
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,696
but I just don't see this
having a future.

212
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:23,099
But you said that you liked him.
What happened?

213
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,099
Did you just change your mind?

214
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:29,301
-Kind of.
-Then change it back!

215
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:34,139
I'm sorry.
It's just, there's no real spark.

216
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,211
Didn't you sleep together?

217
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:37,809
Yeah.

218
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,744
Tramp.

219
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,111
Does Joey have any idea?

220
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,721
I don't think he does.
You know what?

221
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,722
Maybe you could tell him
I'm not interested...

222
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,861
in a serious relationship.

223
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:54,529
You mean, like,
that you're kind of a loner?

224
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,166
Yeah, that'd be great.

225
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,130
And maybe that you're a real stronzo.

226
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,294
I'm sorry.

227
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:04,135
I guess Italian isn't one
of the four languages you speak.

228
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,140
-Hey. Want to go?
-Yeah, let's go.

229
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:12,475
-Okay. See you guys later.
-Bye, guys.

230
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,547
Hey, thank you so much.

231
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,284
Wow.

232
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,324
I guess it wasn't cupid
that brought her here.

233
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:27,123
No, just a regular old flying dwarf.

234
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,701
Yes, yes. How can I help you?

235
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,773
We were just looking around.

236
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,276
Oh, you're fellow scholars.

237
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,981
What exactly were you looking for?

238
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:48,347
Perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's
musings...

239
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,045
on the Smilodon californicus?

240
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,185
Get out of here!

241
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,394
Meeting someone?

242
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,335
Or are you just here to brush up...

243
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,510
on Merriam's views on evolution?

244
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:17,373
Actually, I find Merriam's views
far too progressionist.

245
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:25,320
I find Merriam's views
far too progressionist.

246
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:28,720
I'm sorry. Who are you?

247
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,123
I'm a professor here. Ross Geller.

248
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:35,060
Ross Geller? Why do I know that name?
It's a...

249
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,458
Wait.

250
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:41,769
Did you write this?

251
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,131
Yes.

252
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:51,248
You're the person
who checked out my book?

253
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:56,946
You know, you look nothing
like I would have thought.

254
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,079
You're so young.

255
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:04,059
Well, I skipped fourth grade.

256
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:15,930
I am very, very sorry.

257
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,909
-So how was your date?
-Great. We walked around the Village.

258
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,782
We went to this ice cream place.
Split a milk shake.

259
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,685
Seventy-thirty, but still.

260
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:38,524
I'm thinking of taking her upstate
to one of those bed and breakfasts.

261
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,028
Really? She said she wants to go?

262
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,930
No, it's a surprise. It's gonna be
tricky, because she's busy at work.

263
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,273
Joey, look, honey,
we need to talk, okay?

264
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,670
I got the feeling from her...

265
00:16:55,948 --> 00:17:00,351
that she's not looking
for a serious relationship.

266
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,047
-Where are you getting this?
-She told me.

267
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,289
She said she's kind of a loner.

268
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:19,133
-Joey..
-Hey, Rach, it's cool, you know.

269
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:22,034
I'm a loner too, right?

270
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:26,508
Hey, Joey. You know what?
You are way too good for her.

271
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:31,649
I promise, next time I will tell them
you're not looking for a relationship.

272
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,482
No, don't do that. Just...

273
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:42,486
-Next time, make sure she likes me.
-Well, that too.

274
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:48,963
Joey?

275
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,364
-Do you want some pancakes?
-Finally.

276
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,969
What are we gonna do?

277
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,208
I say we go with "Careless Whisper."

278
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,377
Chandler?

279
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,221
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?

280
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,085
Janice, what are you doing here?

281
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:20,126
I thought I was gonna go back
to my apartment...

282
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:25,427
but I just felt like I really
couldn't be alone tonight.

283
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,876
I was just wondering if I could maybe
stay here with you.

284
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,447
Just, I really feel like I need
to be with family.

285
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,580
Our kids are gonna call her
Aunt Janice, aren't they?

286
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:49,093
Please. Because otherwise,
I really don't know what I might do.

287
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:53,394
Aren't you just a teensy bit curious?

288
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:57,129
-You have any tissues?
-Yeah, in the bathroom.

289
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,736
We'll just let her stay.

290
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:07,139
No. If we let her stay,
she will stay forever.

291
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:11,612
-Kind of like your Barcalounger.
-Is that what you're thinking about?

292
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,614
I never stop thinking about it.

293
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,818
Hey, you guys?

294
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:20,081
Do either one of you want to get
in there before I take my bath?

295
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,292
Janice, I'm sorry...

296
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:27,862
but you can't stay here tonight.

297
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,558
Why not?

298
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,326
Honestly?

299
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:34,800
Our apartment is a hotbed...

300
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,598
for electromagnetic activity.

301
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:42,436
Monica and I have been immunized,
but sadly...

302
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,707
you have not.

303
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,514
I'm gonna need a comforter.

304
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:57,284
Do you have a hypoallergenic one?
Because otherwise I get very nasal.

305
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:04,290
Do you have a cat?
Because it's already happening.

306
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,361
Do you hear that? Listen.

307
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:13,008
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
You have to go.

308
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,201
Why?

309
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,542
Because Chandler still has
feelings for you.

310
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,315
He does?

311
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,384
Say again?

312
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,423
That's right. That's right.

313
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:32,721
And that is why you can't
stay here tonight.

314
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:36,126
And probably why you shouldn't come
to the wedding.

315
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:40,165
Feelings. Such strong feelings.

316
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:46,408
I mean, I realize that his feelings
may never completely go away...

317
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,670
but you can.

318
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,579
Oh, my God.

319
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:56,446
I understand. I am so sorry.

320
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,087
I'll go.

321
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,952
Goodbye, Monica.

322
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:09,257
I wish you a lifetime
of happiness with him.

323
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,526
Chandler.

324
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,801
You call me when this goes
in the pooper.

325
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,753
I've got this section covered.

326
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,957
Yeah, in fact, I've got this baby
to shine in people's eyes.

327
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:34,920
Okay, see you later.

328
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,569
I just wanted
to show Monica your book.

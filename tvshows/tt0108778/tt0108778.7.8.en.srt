1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,897
-Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving.
-No, no, no.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,938
Are we keeping Thanksgiving
a secret this year?

3
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:12,270
We're playing a game
I learned.

4
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:15,037
You have to name all the states
in six minutes.

5
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:17,875
What? That's like insanely easy.

6
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:20,678
It's harder than it sounds.
You always forget one.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,048
Or in some cases, 14.

8
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:29,785
It's stupid and I wasn't playing with
people, so technically, I didn't lose.

9
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:32,030
You forgot 14 states?

10
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:34,597
Nobody cares about the Dakotas!

11
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:37,425
Okay, time's up.

12
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,035
All right, I got 48.

13
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,729
That's not bad. Phoebe?

14
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,036
I got tired of naming states,
so I listed the types of celery.

15
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:49,140
And I have one, regular celery.

16
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:54,346
So Rachel's got 48
and Phoebe has the lead in...

17
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,251
vegetables. Joey?

18
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:00,751
Say hello to the new champ
of Chandler's dumb states game.

19
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:04,994
-Wow, how many you got?
-Fifty-six.

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,527
The One Where Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs

21
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,903
Hey, how is New England not a state?

22
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,274
They have a sports team.

23
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:54,408
Does South Oregon have a sports team?

24
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,216
There you go.

25
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,211
Why one extra place setting?

26
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,921
You invited your assistant.

27
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,852
Oh, right, sorry. Tag's not coming.

28
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:09,926
His girlfriend came into town,
so he's with her.

29
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:11,152
Why didn't you tell me?

30
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:14,662
I made him his own
sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.

31
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:17,963
I was going to,
but then I figured...

32
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:21,435
your food is so delicious
and perfect...

33
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,973
you can never have too many
of those pumpkin things.

34
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:30,274
You'd think I wouldn't enjoy that
since it's so fake, but I still do.

35
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:33,244
Regular celery!

36
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,283
I already have that.

37
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:38,946
Done...

38
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,250
with time to spare.

39
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:46,125
-This may be a new world's record.
-I hate to lecture you guys...

40
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:49,994
but it's disgraceful that
a group of well-educated adults...

41
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:54,900
and Joey can't name all the states.

42
00:02:55,141 --> 00:03:00,511
You ever see a map or one of those
round colorful things called a globe?

43
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:04,782
Magellan? You got 46 states.

44
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:08,647
-What? That's impossible.
-Forty-six.

45
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:12,289
Well, who's well-educated now,
Mr. I-Forgot-Ten-States?

46
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,351
I'm going to go turn on Joey's oven.

47
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:19,588
Please, watch him.
Do not let Joey eat any of the food.

48
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,460
I am only one man.

49
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:26,261
-Okay, time is up.
-Now, just give me another minute.

50
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,635
If you don't know them by now,
you never will, okay?

51
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:33,869
That is the beauty of this game.
It makes you want to kill yourself.

52
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,373
This is crazy. I can do this.

53
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:40,050
All right, I bet I can get
all 50 before dinner.

54
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,516
Okay, but if you can't, no dinner.

55
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:44,120
You're on.

56
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,986
Don't look at my list, because there's
a lot on there that you don't have.

57
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,821
Did you know your oven doesn't work?

58
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:55,899
The drawer full of takeout
menus is okay, right?

59
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,401
Ross, I'm gonna use yours.

60
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,069
Chandler, give me a hand.

61
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:07,507
Joey, do not let Ross look at maps
or the globe in your apartment.

62
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,683
Don't worry.
It's not a globe of the United States.

63
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,019
I'm gonna go out and take a walk.

64
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,524
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?

65
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,290
-Oh, it's not.
-Seriously, it's moving.

66
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,990
-What the hell's in there?
-It's just my knitting. That's all.

67
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:37,901
Yes, I knit this.

68
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,037
I'm very good.

69
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,878
Ross' apartment is nice.
Why don't we hang out here?

70
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,885
Maybe because it smells weird.

71
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,354
It's like old pumpkins or something.

72
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,886
-That's my pie.
-Which smells delicious.

73
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,397
-Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
-What?

74
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,567
We left Joey alone with the food.

75
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,035
Yep, yep, I knew it.

76
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,862
There he is...

77
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:09,200
feeding stuffing to a dog!

78
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:17,747
Hi, Geller-Bing residence.
How can I help?

79
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,543
Why is a dog in our apartment?

80
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:22,550
I'm sorry, who's this?

81
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,747
There's a dog sitting on my couch.

82
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:29,052
Tell her I'm allergic, and I will sue!

83
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,622
-There's no dog here.
-There is!

84
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,993
He's black and white and shaggy.

85
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,601
He's sitting next to Rachel
and licking her hand.

86
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,296
Oh, my God! Where are you?

87
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,165
I'll be right there.

88
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,773
They're here already?
How are they doing this?!

89
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:57,017
Hi, Tag.
What are you doing here?

90
00:05:57,256 --> 00:06:00,453
I wanted to see if your offer
was still good.

91
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,651
Well, sure. Come in.

92
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,522
Well, what happened
to your girlfriend?

93
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,993
We kind of broke up this morning.

94
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,637
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.

95
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,466
Ohio, thank you.

96
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,645
Where's the dog?

97
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,008
What dog? There's no dog here.

98
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:25,307
Yeah, that dog left.

99
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,682
Phoebe. Phoebe, open up.

100
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,185
There's no dog in here.

101
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,991
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking.

102
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:39,630
No, that's just me coughing.

103
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,328
Oh, good. There you are.

104
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,632
Listen, I have a dog in my room.

105
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:51,708
What is it doing here?

106
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:54,208
I'm watching it for friends
who left town.

107
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:55,674
Wait.

108
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,847
Hello, my name is Klunkers.

109
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:03,178
May I please stay
with you nice people?

110
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,558
I wish he could stay,
but Chandler's allergic.

111
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,557
Extremely allergic, okay?

112
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,992
If I'm anywhere near a dog
for more than five minutes...

113
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,826
my throat will just close up.

114
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:19,562
That's odd. This dog's been
living here for the past three days.

115
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:26,975
Really?

116
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,004
If he's been here
that long...

117
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:33,582
without a reaction, maybe
you're not allergic to it.

118
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,378
It still has to go, right?

119
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:36,748
Why?

120
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,724
-Okay, it's..
-Don't do it!

121
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,695
-Don't do what?
-I have to.

122
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,195
Okay? It's time.

123
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,034
Okay, I hate dogs.

124
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,207
-What?!
-That's crazy? Why?

125
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,241
Told you.

126
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,514
They are needy...

127
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,618
jumpy, and you can't tell
what they are thinking...

128
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:10,321
and that scares me a little bit.

129
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,620
You're right. They are scary.

130
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:17,227
She just ate a treat out of my hand!

131
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,889
Wait. Do you not like all dogs?

132
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:22,532
I mean, not even puppies?

133
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,327
Is there a puppy here?

134
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,738
-You don't like puppies?
-Okay, you are new.

135
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:37,112
Look, Chandler, I told you. Never
tell anyone about this dog thing.

136
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,284
It's like Ross not liking ice cream.

137
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:44,147
-You don't like ice cream?
-It's too cold!

138
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,283
It's just that dogs make me
a little uncomfortable.

139
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,051
Hurts my teeth.

140
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,156
And I don't want you guys
to hate me...

141
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,028
but I don't think I can be around
that dog anymore, okay?

142
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,670
So either the dog goes or I go.

143
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,213
Oh, my God!

144
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,316
How can I not get this?

145
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:19,048
I'm a college professor.
I got 1450 on my SATs.

146
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,689
Twelve fifty.

147
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,852
Damn, I forgot you were here.

148
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,757
We're gonna take Klunkers to Ross'.

149
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,227
We'll be back soon.

150
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,299
Can I ask you a question?

151
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,302
When a guy breaks up
with his girlfriend...

152
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:37,600
what is an appropriate amount
of time to wait before making a move?

153
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,471
I'd say about a month.

154
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,770
Really? I'd say three to four.

155
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:42,937
Half-hour.

156
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:48,686
Interesting.

157
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,322
When it's your assistant,
I'd say never.

158
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:55,118
All right, Rach, the big question is,
does he like you?

159
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:59,287
Because if he doesn't like you,
this is all a moo point.

160
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,697
A "moo" point?

161
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:08,707
Yeah. It's like a cow's opinion.

162
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,234
It just doesn't matter.

163
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,213
It's "moo."

164
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:26,213
Have I been living with him
for too long, or did that make sense?

165
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:28,520
Don't listen to Joey.

166
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,423
Okay, would you look at him?

167
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,394
He's obviously depressed.
He's away from his family.

168
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,569
What he needs right now is
for you to be his friend.

169
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,330
You're right. I'm sorry.
Thank you.

170
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:44,509
-Okay, that's what I'm going to do.
-Fine, take their advice.

171
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,244
No one ever listens to me.

172
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,937
When the package is this pretty,
no one cares what's inside.

173
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,949
How you holding up?

174
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,849
Not bad.

175
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:05,293
-I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
-Thanks.

176
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:09,762
-Were you guys together a long time?
-A year, on and off.

177
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:13,436
I thought we'd end up together.
I don't anymore.

178
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,164
-Now that she broke up with you.
-Yeah.

179
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,068
It's weird.

180
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,715
I used to assume that I would meet
someone and fall in love and be happy.

181
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:27,977
That all that was just a given.
Lately, it's like, what if it's not?

182
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,485
Do you ever have that feeling?

183
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,213
No.

184
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:33,885
Yeah.

185
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,228
All the time.
Constantly. It's terrifying.

186
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:40,728
But you know, then I figure
it has to work out.

187
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:42,726
Why?

188
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,562
Because it has to.

189
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:50,340
-You have all the answers, don't you?
-No, no, I do. I really do.

190
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:55,206
-Thanks for talking to me.
-Come on, what are bosses for?

191
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:56,813
Hug it out.

192
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,510
All right, he likes you back.

193
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,586
Told you you should go for it.

194
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,225
What?

195
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,796
Street noise drown any of that out?

196
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:16,594
No? See you later.

197
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:17,860
Okay.

198
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:26,203
What did Joey say? I like you back?

199
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:34,775
Joey knows that I'm very insecure
about my back.

200
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,285
And you were hugging me...

201
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:42,654
so obviously you are not
repulsed by it. Yeah!

202
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,456
-Wait, that doesn't make any sense.
-No?

203
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,161
All right, here's the truth.

204
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,842
Joey said what he said...

205
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,372
because I'm attracted to you.

206
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:02,871
Wow.

207
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,548
Yeah, I admit it.

208
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:09,978
I have a crush on you. I know that's
crazy because we work together...

209
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:11,883
and nothing could ever happen.

210
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,558
The last thing I wanted to do
was freak you out...

211
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,763
or make you feel uncomfortable.

212
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:22,491
Which is why it would be great
if you said something right about now.

213
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:26,269
Oh, my God.
Those guys are stealing my car.

214
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,530
What?

215
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:30,139
Right there. That's my car!

216
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,674
-Hey!
-Okay, that'll take one minute.

217
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:35,472
Do you have anything else to say?

218
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:36,908
I can't believe it.

219
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:40,983
We still have time to talk,
and they're not even in the car yet.

220
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,154
Look, there they go.

221
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:47,521
Okay, Phoebe.
We should probably go back now.

222
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,427
Please, don't leave me.
I'll be lonely.

223
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,557
Stop it. Stop.

224
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,530
-Okay, let's go. We can be strong.
-Yeah, okay.

225
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:03,501
Did you hear that?
She said, "Monica."

226
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,104
I can't leave her.

227
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,406
We could sneak the dog back
and Chandler wouldn't even know.

228
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:11,605
That won't work.

229
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:15,047
I've had that dog for three days,
and Chandler had no idea.

230
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,686
He's not so smart.

231
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,482
Hey. I didn't know either.

232
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:24,059
Yeah, but you kind of knew that
something was going on, didn't you?

233
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:25,996
Yeah, I knew.

234
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,160
Where's Chandler?

235
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,997
-Here I am.
-Wash your hands.

236
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,969
How did you know?

237
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,175
Hey, what's she doing back here?

238
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:50,320
Relax, Ross.
She's not made of ice cream.

239
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,385
Hey, look, Phoebe.
I laid out the states geographically.

240
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:58,893
We don't have time.
We have to keep Chandler away.

241
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:03,034
-Yeah, but, look what..
-This is what we do not have time for!

242
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,971
-Where's Monica?
-ln Phoebe's room. You can't go in.

243
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,437
Why not?

244
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,945
Monica's crying.

245
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:22,284
She's very upset
about this whole Klunkers thing.

246
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,924
-Well, I should go in there.
-No, no.

247
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:29,321
No, she doesn't want to see
you right now.

248
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,496
-Why not?
-Because you sent away the dog.

249
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,994
-That's ridiculous.
-Oh, is it? Is it?!

250
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:43,797
Look, when Monica and I were kids,
we had a dog named Rover.

251
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:47,877
And one day, my dad decides
he doesn't like dogs.

252
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,039
So Monica and her friend, Phyllis...

253
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:56,983
take away the dog and that was the
last time we ever saw him. See?

254
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,987
This is just like that...

255
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:04,093
only with a few details changed.

256
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,694
Okay, I'm in my sweatpants.

257
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,231
Bring on the food.

258
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,773
-What's the matter?
-Monica's upset because of Klunkers.

259
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,207
So? Bring the dog back.
You're a hero.

260
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:26,176
Yeah, I could be a hero.
I could do that.

261
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,613
What if it attacks me?

262
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,886
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.

263
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,188
And that doesn't scare you?

264
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,928
Ross, you need some help?

265
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,801
From you?

266
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,732
Yes, please.

267
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,640
First of all, Utah?

268
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,582
Dude, you can't just make stuff up.

269
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,117
I hate America!

270
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,886
When I finish this game,
I swear I am moving.

271
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:16,192
-Tag still talking to the police?
-Yeah.

272
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,927
Dammit. Why did I open my mouth?

273
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,866
"I have a crush on you.
I'm attracted to you."

274
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,234
I know that I freaked him out.

275
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,343
If you said it like that, you did.

276
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,507
Hey, is Chandler here?

277
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,378
No, he went for a walk.

278
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:36,053
Okay, you cannot tell him,
but look who's back.

279
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,256
Well, no, no, no.

280
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,960
He went over to Ross' to bring
the dog back here.

281
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,926
Oh, no, the dog's not going
to be there!

282
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,924
You think?

283
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,463
Hi, honey.

284
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,740
Please, please, please,
don't be mad at me.

285
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,911
-What? Why would..?
-Wait and see.

286
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,410
Maybe we will, maybe we won't.

287
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,985
Okay, I went over to Ross'
to bring back Klunkers for you...

288
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:11,882
and I left the door open,
and she must've gotten out.

289
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:16,622
And I looked everywhere, all over
the apartment, including the roof.

290
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:20,797
Which, FYI, Ross,
one of your neighbors, growing weed.

291
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,100
I couldn't find him...

292
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:28,272
and I am so, so, so sorry.

293
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:33,069
But I do know where we can all go
ease the pain.

294
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,844
We have good news. Look who's back!

295
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:42,787
Klunkers. Oh, my God!

296
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:47,652
-She came back all by herself.
-It's a Thanksgiving miracle.

297
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,929
It is so good to see you.

298
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,258
She came all the way back
from Ross'.

299
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,230
The things she must've seen.

300
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,597
She climbed up the fire escape...

301
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:04,537
and tapped on the window with her
teeny paw, and we ran to let her in.

302
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,306
I went too far, didn't I?

303
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,239
When should I have stopped?

304
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:21,156
Okay, maybe this is so hard,
because there aren't 50 states.

305
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:26,464
Let me tell you something.
I have 49 states...

306
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,758
and there are no more!

307
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:33,037
I think I should be able
to eat something.

308
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,264
It's up to you.

309
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,913
-Oh, hi. How are you doing?
-I'm okay.

310
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:46,140
I got to go to the police station
and look at mug shots.

311
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,545
Thanks for having me over.

312
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:50,014
Tag, you're going?

313
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,056
We didn't even get a chance to talk.

314
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,691
So where did you say
you're from again?

315
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,362
-Colorado.
-What good are you?

316
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,538
Look, I think we should talk
about what happened on the terrace.

317
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,037
Okay.

318
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,173
I never should've said what I said.

319
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,743
It just doesn't matter how I feel.

320
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:18,505
We work together, so nothing could
ever happen between us.

321
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:23,619
I would love to go to work on Monday
and never talk about this again.

322
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,757
Okay. Big day, Monday.
Lots to do.

323
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,357
So we okay?

324
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,722
I'm not.

325
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,227
I freaked you out.

326
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:35,262
No, you didn't.

327
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:39,730
What freaked me out was you saying
nothing could happen between us.

328
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:43,070
-Really?
-Yeah.

329
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,439
So please don't fire me
for doing this.

330
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,719
That's one less thing
we have to do on Monday.

331
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,012
Delaware.

332
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,242
Delaware.

333
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,980
-All right.
-I want my turkey now.

334
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,083
You got it.

335
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,359
You got Nevada twice.

336
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:45,827
-I know.
-Yeah.

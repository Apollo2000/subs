1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,567
Thanks for coming by.

2
00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:07,899
We wanted to bounce some ideas off
of you about the wedding ceremony.

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,777
-What's the matter? Are you okay?
-It's just...

4
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:14,570
Monica said "wedding."

5
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,441
We thought one of you
could read something.

6
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:22,279
Okay, yeah, I guess I can do that too.

7
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:25,213
Too?

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,295
I kind of have something else
planned for you guys.

9
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:32,228
-Do you mind telling us what it is?
-Sorry.

10
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:35,764
I'm kind of keeping this one
on the QT.

11
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:38,630
Whatever it is,
I hope it involves winking.

12
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:42,405
-Hey.
-Hey.

13
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:44,734
I talked to one of the DOOL writers..

14
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:47,171
-What is DOOL?
-Days Of Our Lives.

15
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:53,015
You won't believe it. My character
is coming out of his coma!

16
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,153
-That's wonderful.
-Wow, Joey.

17
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:59,119
And not only that.
I'm getting a new brain!

18
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:04,322
So great things are happening at work
and in your personal life.

19
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,090
You're getting a new brain?

20
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,996
They're killing off
one of the characters...

21
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:13,172
and her brain is being transplanted
into my body.

22
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,511
What? A brain transplant?

23
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,336
It's ridiculous.

24
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,777
It's ridiculous that you
haven't had sex in three months.

25
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:32,287
It's winter.
There are fewer people on the street.

26
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:34,921
Who are they killing off?

27
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,686
Cecilia Monroe.
She plays Jessica Lockhart.

28
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,398
No!

29
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,695
She is so good at throwing drinks
in people's faces.

30
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,599
I don't think I've ever seen
her finish a drink.

31
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:49,398
The way she slaps people.
Wouldn't you love to?

32
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,166
Don't do it.

33
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:53,876
And she's been on the show forever.

34
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,674
It's gonna be really hard
to fill her shoes.

35
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,044
Help me out here.

36
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:02,812
When you come out
of the brain transplant...

37
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,923
you are going to be her?

38
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,060
Yes, but in Drake Ramoray's body.

39
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:15,590
Why is this so hard for you to get?
I thought you were a scientist.

40
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,264
The One Where Joey Gets A New Brain

41
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,004
Rach, so that guy there:

42
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,335
Straight or gay?

43
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:04,341
Oh, yeah, he's too cute
to be straight.

44
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,711
Knockers will help us
figure it out.

45
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,155
All right, straight.

46
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,726
And not subtle.

47
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,762
He left his cell phone.

48
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:24,763
We could have Gunther
put it in lost and found.

49
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,667
Or we could use it to call China,
see how those guys are doing.

50
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,538
What if he calls his own cell phone
and I answer...

51
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:36,179
and we start talking
and we fell in love?

52
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,543
Would that be a great story?

53
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,616
Kind of like a fairy tale
for the digital age.

54
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,515
That does sound great.
I'm getting the phone.

55
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:48,056
What? Wait.
Why do you get the story?

56
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,990
I haven't been
out on a date in so long.

57
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,698
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.

58
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:58,529
That wasn't a date. That was friends
getting together and having sex.

59
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,898
Okay. Great. I get the phone.

60
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:04,302
No way. You just broke up with Tag
a week ago.

61
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:09,811
Yeah, and until now, I didn't think
I would love again.

62
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,079
-Nice try.
-Wait.

63
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,412
How do we fairly decide
who gets the phone?

64
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,485
I don't know.

65
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,864
Maybe we could...

66
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,231
Ah-ha! Too slow!

67
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:34,233
Ah-ha! Too cocky.

68
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,012
I'm dating him.
There's nothing you can do.

69
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,238
Yes, there is.

70
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:45,746
Are you going to kill him
like you did Charles?

71
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,451
Oh, my baby.

72
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,293
Cut!

73
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,062
That was great. And that slap looked
so real. How do you do that?

74
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:08,934
-Oh, just years of experience.
-Can I get some ice here?!

75
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,441
I just wanted to say how wonderful
I think you are.

76
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,304
You're not the fan who's dying,
are you?

77
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,509
I'm Joey Tribbiani.
We did a scene together yesterday.

78
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:24,120
-I'm the guy in the coma.
-Oh, that was a real person?

79
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:30,528
Since I'm getting your brain
when you leave the show...

80
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,628
I was wondering if..

81
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:36,357
-I'm leaving the show?
-Why? Did you hear something?

82
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,234
Who told you that?

83
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:44,004
-One of the writers.
-Was it bald or was it tall?

84
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,139
You know, it doesn't matter,
because it is not true.

85
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,575
Okay.

86
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:53,378
And if it were true, how dare you come
to me and ask me for tips...

87
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:56,315
about a character I've played
for 20 years!

88
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:04,325
Miss Monroe..
Oh, there you go.

89
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,065
Okay, look, I have an idea.

90
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:14,637
Why don't we see what kind of numbers
he has on his speed dial...

91
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:19,368
and then whoever has more in common
with him gets the phone.

92
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,844
-Fine. All right.
-All right.

93
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:26,345
First name on the speed dial is "Mom."

94
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:29,384
Oh. I lost my mom to suicide.

95
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,484
You can't use that to get the cute guy
and the last blueberry muffin.

96
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,286
Did I use that already today? Sorry.

97
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,166
"Ben, Carlos, David.."

98
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,837
Oh, I win. He's got Barney's
on his speed dial.

99
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,505
You don't know it's Barney's
the store.

100
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,334
That could be his friend's
house, a bar..

101
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,737
Who has Barney's the store
on their speed dial?

102
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,071
His new girlfriend.

103
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,322
What is that?

104
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:13,359
I think it's the Dying Cat Parade.

105
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,196
Sounds like it's coming
from across the street.

106
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:21,936
-Oh, my God.
-What?

107
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,507
The thing that Ross was gonna
do at our wedding?

108
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:28,441
He was hanging out with me and said,
"You're half Scottish, right?"

109
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:32,379
No. There is no way.
It cannot be Ross.

110
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,052
Unbelievable.
Why is your family Scottish?

111
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,195
Why is your family Ross?

112
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,363
He cannot play at our wedding.

113
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:55,768
I mean, come on. That is just noise!

114
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,907
It's not even a song.

115
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,503
Wait. If you listen very carefully...

116
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:04,740
I think it's "Celebration"
by Kool and the Gang.

117
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,849
You're right.
They are writing me out of the show.

118
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:17,494
They don't know exactly when
it's going to happen, but soon...

119
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,288
and then that's it.

120
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:22,557
If it was up to me,
you would never leave the show.

121
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,895
-Yeah, thanks.
-I mean it.

122
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:28,402
I can't believe they'd do this to you.
And to your fans.

123
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:33,011
They're gonna be devastated.
Heartbroken. They love you so much.

124
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,513
Oh, you're right.

125
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:37,410
Thank you.

126
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,447
What's your name again?

127
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,281
-Joey.
-Thank you.

128
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,716
That is so sweet.

129
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,951
The only reason
I came up to you before...

130
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:49,819
is because, well...

131
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:53,122
I'm really nervous about being you.

132
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:57,393
If you could help me capture
the essence of the character...

133
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,265
Help me keep Jessica alive.
Please?

134
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,209
Joey, I will help you.

135
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,913
Not because I owe it
to this stupid show...

136
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,343
but because I owe it to Jessica.

137
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,349
-Oh, thank you so much.
-You're so welcome.

138
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:17,249
I've been watching some tapes.
How's this?

139
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,648
Jessica Lockhart will never
step foot in this place again!

140
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,088
Never!

141
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:29,190
Jessica doesn't have
an English accent.

142
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,529
I can do an English accent?

143
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:36,335
That baby's going on my resume.

144
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,410
-Hi. How are you?
-Good.

145
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,083
Remember when we were
in the coffeehouse...

146
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:48,377
we decided I was gonna keep
the cute guy's phone?

147
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:53,184
I was gonna keep it in my purse, so if
it rang, I could just pick it up?

148
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,629
Do you remember going into my purse
and stealing the phone?

149
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,430
Ooh, now you lost me.

150
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,027
-You stole the phone.
-No, I didn't.

151
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,262
You're saying if I called it,
it wouldn't ring?

152
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,598
-No.
-Okay.

153
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:13,402
But while you dial, let me show you
the features of my new ringing handbag.

154
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:17,138
Oh, it does work.

155
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,518
-Phoebe.
-That is a different phone.

156
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:25,520
Oh, is it? Hello. Yes, hi.
Is Rachel there?

157
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:29,126
Yes, she is. Just one moment, please.
It's for me!

158
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,927
That is damning evidence.

159
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,027
Oh, my God. I bet that's him.

160
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:40,598
My digital fairy tale's
about to begin.

161
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,575
Would you stop doing that?

162
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,678
Hello? Yes, I'm the one
who found your phone.

163
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,473
-Phoebe, you can't..
-Shh, I'm on a call.

164
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:57,655
Yeah, you can pick it up tonight.
Say, 8:30?

165
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:00,756
At my apartment.

166
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,487
It's 5 Morton Street,
apartment 14.

167
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:08,860
And then maybe, you know, after,
we can grab a bite to eat or whatever.

168
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,433
Okay. Okay, I'll see you then. Bye.

169
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,567
I will be here when he comes over.

170
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,937
How will you know what time
to come over?

171
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:21,475
You just said it.

172
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,774
Oh.

173
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:34,784
The essence of the character
is rooted in her confidence.

174
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,793
So when Jessica enters a room,
for instance...

175
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,964
she owns everything...

176
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:43,895
and every person in that room.

177
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,235
-You try it.
-Okay.

178
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:57,572
He's not mad at the room.

179
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,910
Try it again. He owns it.
He owns the room.

180
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:06,818
It is his. He owns, owns,
owns the room! He owns it!

181
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,723
It's a little weird,
but it's getting better.

182
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:15,995
I'm gonna miss this woman so much.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

183
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,498
It's been 20 years of my life.

184
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:22,463
Hey, hey. Maybe this is a good thing.

185
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,701
It'll give you a chance to shake
things up. Play different characters.

186
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,311
You're so talented.

187
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:33,280
Probably should've just left years ago
when the offers were pouring in...

188
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,488
but I just got
so comfy here and...

189
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,155
I turned down some amazing work.

190
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,756
Like what?

191
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,523
Well, let's just say
if I'd left 15 years ago...

192
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:49,325
the landscape of Mexican
cinema would be very different today.

193
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,032
Wow.

194
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:59,501
But, well, now...
Now's a different time for me.

195
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:05,340
Oh, hey, come on. Don't do this.

196
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,848
Let me tell you something, okay?

197
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,784
When I watch you do a scene, I'm
thinking, "She is a great actress."

198
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:17,655
But I'm also thinking, "She is hot."

199
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,958
You think I'm hot?

200
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,065
You own the room.

201
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,643
We should probably get the...

202
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:34,038
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we should get..

203
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,377
So when Jessica kisses a man...

204
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,051
she usually puts...

205
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,192
both her hands on the man's face.

206
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,896
I notice that.
Is that because she's so passionate?

207
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,531
No, it's because that way
the camera only sees her.

208
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,370
You want to try it?

209
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,665
Yeah, okay.

210
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,449
That was good. That was really good.

211
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:25,563
But I think that maybe your hands
are just a little off. They should..

212
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,967
Well, I feel like a snack.

213
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:40,872
Do you want some shortbread?
It's Scottish, like you are.

214
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,476
Oh, no, thanks. I don't like anything
from my Scottish heritage.

215
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,241
What?

216
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,913
Well, it's just that my entire family
was run out of Scotland by...

217
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,649
Vikings.

218
00:14:55,561 --> 00:15:00,362
It sounds like your family's ready
to rediscover its Scottish roots.

219
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,066
You can't play bagpipes
at the wedding!

220
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:05,767
How did you know?

221
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:10,908
-We heard you play from our apartment.
-Were you the ones who called the cops?

222
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,508
That's not really important right now.

223
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,274
What is important is, while we
appreciate the gesture...

224
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:22,648
we just don't feel that bagpipes
are appropriate for our wedding.

225
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,016
-Why not?
-Because we hate them.

226
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:30,391
Just give me a chance to perform for
you, then decide whatever you want.

227
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:34,087
I'm not gonna tell you what song
I'm gonna play, either.

228
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,164
Let's just say when it's over...

229
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:40,303
I'll bet there'll be
a wee bit o'celebration.

230
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,209
Hey, hey!

231
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,543
Who is it?

232
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,482
It's Tom.
I'm here to pick up the phone.

233
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,791
Why do you get to answer the door?

234
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:02,619
-Why shouldn't I?
-Because it's my apartment.

235
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,920
Then I get to give him the phone.

236
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:08,622
Okay. Good luck explaining
all the calls to China.

237
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:12,799
Hi.

238
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,307
Wow, how long were we arguing for?

239
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,976
You're not the man who left the phone.

240
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:29,517
-No, that's my assistant.
-Is he coming?

241
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,718
No.

242
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,755
-Could you give us one second?
-Sure.

243
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:37,222
We'll be right back, sir.

244
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:42,030
-What do we do?
-I don't know.

245
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,699
Can you believe this?

246
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:47,097
We were waiting for a hot guy
and a hotter one shows up.

247
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,704
I know..

248
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,171
What?

249
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,404
Rachel, listen...

250
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,708
if you let me have him,
then I will really owe you one.

251
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,420
All right.

252
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,588
All right, I will let you have him.

253
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,919
But you owe me. You owe me big.

254
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,588
Which one of you will I
take to dinner?

255
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,027
Oh, that'd be me, sir.

256
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,034
Nice.

257
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:31,080
Well, you certainly own that room.

258
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:37,221
Actually, I rent the whole place.
I just got what you meant. Thank you.

259
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:41,820
-Hi.
-Hey.

260
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,927
Oh, my God.

261
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,021
Oh, my God.

262
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,567
Oh, Jessica Lockhart!
In my apartment!

263
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,002
I am such a huge fan.
I am such a huge fan.

264
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,504
It's nice to know..

265
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,141
Monica!

266
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,242
That's my roommate, Rachel.

267
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,482
That explains the women's underwear.

268
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,308
Sure.

269
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,180
Oh, my God, it's true!

270
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,752
Can I just ask you to do me
just one favor?

271
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,461
Certainly.

272
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,493
Would you slap me
right here in the face?

273
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:26,170
I'd love to, but my lawyer said
I can't do that anymore.

274
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,769
All right, here we go.

275
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,101
No, wait. Just one moment.

276
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,340
-You're a stupid bitch.
-I really can't slap you.

277
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,508
-My God, you're great.
-Thanks for stopping by.

278
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,686
-I am so sorry about that.
-Oh, no.

279
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:48,757
Being adored, I'm used to it.
Don't worry about it.

280
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,485
-Oh, my God.
-What?

281
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,628
They sent me today's script.
They never send me the script.

282
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,061
-They don't?
-I'm in a coma.

283
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,770
This must mean I have lines.

284
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,702
Oh.

285
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,800
How does it happen?

286
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:13,546
You get thrown from a horse
into an electric fence.

287
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,615
A what? Jessica hates horses.

288
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:21,883
After this she's not gonna be crazy
about electricity, either.

289
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:30,327
Loosening the saddle on Mother's horse
was brilliant, Fredrick.

290
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:33,162
And the electric fence, inspired.

291
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:34,803
Thank you, sweetheart.

292
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,275
I can't believe she's really gone.

293
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,404
Look around you. All of this is ours.

294
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,342
I don't think so.

295
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:49,812
Who are you?

296
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,919
What's the matter, Dina?

297
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,820
Don't you recognize your own...

298
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,492
mother?

299
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:02,127
Cut! That was great, everybody.
Thank you.

300
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,835
That was so wonderful!

301
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,369
I think that you're a better
Jessica than I ever was.

302
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,438
-Oh, no.
-Of course not, but you were good.

303
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:12,803
Thanks.

304
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:15,205
Good news. I got another job.

305
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,846
Great. Hey, all right! What is it?

306
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,277
A film in Guadalajara.

307
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,978
The airport?

308
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,590
No, that's LaGuardia.

309
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:33,662
-This is Mexico.
-Oh, wow.

310
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,163
Well, how long will you be gone?

311
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,198
Eight months.

312
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:42,800
-That's a really long time.
-Yeah, but you could come and visit.

313
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:47,240
I bet you could own
a few places down there.

314
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:52,176
Oh, you know, I should probably
buy a place in the city first.

315
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,744
And I just got what you meant.
That is..

316
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,252
-That's a tricky one.
-It's tricky.

317
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:04,420
Good luck.

318
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,888
You too.

319
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:26,777
Now, remember, I'm still learning.

320
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,986
One, two, three, four!

321
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:59,282
You know this song. Sing along.

322
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:17,796
So?

323
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,697
No!

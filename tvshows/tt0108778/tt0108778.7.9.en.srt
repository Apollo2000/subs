1
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:08,439
-I'm ready.
-You sure?

2
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:11,404
Let me just straighten out
your helmet there.

3
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:15,274
-Thanks, Daddy.
-No, no. One daddy, two mommies.

4
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:19,975
-All right, it's all yours.
-Okay, okay.

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,983
There you go, there you go.

6
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:26,181
Wow, Ben's first big kid's bike.
This is so exciting!

7
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:28,327
Oh, yeah, I remember mine.

8
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:31,052
It was my sixth birthday.
I went to the park...

9
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:34,722
-and I got on it and it bent.
-Yeah.

10
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:38,396
-I never had a bike of my own.
-What?

11
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,402
We didn't have a lot of money.

12
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:43,337
But the girl across the street
had the best bike.

13
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:47,979
It was pink and it had rainbow-colored
tassels hanging off the handles...

14
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:51,217
and a bell
and this big, white wicker basket...

15
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:54,443
with those
plastic daisies stuck on.

16
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:57,252
That sounds like my first bike.

17
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,488
My dad gave me his old one.

18
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:03,822
-Did the girl ever let you ride it?
-No.

19
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,430
But she gave me the box
that it came in.

20
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,766
It had a picture of the bike
on the front.

21
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,534
So I would sit on it and my stepdad
would drag me around the backyard.

22
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:16,968
That is so unfair.

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,177
Not really, I got
to drag him around too.

24
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:23,174
The One With All the Candy

25
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,088
Hey, what are you guys doing?

26
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,386
Making candy for the neighbors.

27
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:10,887
I'm sorry, who?

28
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:14,525
I'm gonna hang
a basket on the door.

29
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,703
When the neighbors walk by,
they can take a piece.

30
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,335
-But we don't know the neighbors.
-I do.

31
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,704
There's, let's see,
the guy with the mustache...

32
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:28,244
smokes-a-lot lady,
some kids I've seen...

33
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:32,508
and the red-haired guy
who does not like to be called Rusty.

34
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,882
See, this is exactly why
I'm making this candy.

35
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,989
We can get to know our neighbors.

36
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,557
Wouldn't it be easier
if we just moved?

37
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,391
Good morning!

38
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,931
-Somebody's in a good mood.
-Well, why shouldn't I be?

39
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:52,127
I have great friends.
I have a wonderful job..

40
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,364
Where you can make out
with your assistant.

41
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:56,768
It's not a big deal.

42
00:02:56,976 --> 00:03:01,003
We stayed up creating a plan so
that us dating won't be a problem.

43
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,010
Oh, yeah? What's the plan?

44
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:09,683
We.. We are not...

45
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,624
going to let it...

46
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:14,486
be a problem.

47
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,622
It took you all night
to come up with that plan?

48
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:21,265
Well, you know,
we did other stuff too.

49
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:23,658
Did you two...?

50
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,430
Oh, I don't sleep with guys
on the first date.

51
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,301
-Matt Wire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wise..
-Anymore!

52
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:39,616
Hi, Tag, I have a conference call
today, is that correct?

53
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:42,878
-Yes, at 4.
-Okay, thank you, that'll be all.

54
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,614
Wait, wait.

55
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:50,219
Did you see that?

56
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,558
He had no idea there was
something going on between us.

57
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,733
-I'd better get back to my desk.
-Okay, hard worker.

58
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,737
I'll put that in your evaluation.

59
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,047
-My what?
-You've been here for two months now.

60
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,915
And your boss is required to hand in
a performance evaluation.

61
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:19,990
But you know, there is one thing
that I have yet to evaluate.

62
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,826
-Are you serious?
-No, but I've always wanted to do that.

63
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,336
Can you help me clean this up?

64
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:42,376
The basket is totally empty!
The neighbors ate it all!

65
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,015
Well, either that or...

66
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,677
Joey!

67
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:50,913
Yeah?

68
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:54,352
-Did you eat all the neighbor candy?
-That was the plan.

69
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,825
When I got to it,
there was only a few pieces left.

70
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,158
They've come by all day.
They love it.

71
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,994
They love my candy?

72
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:06,228
-Oh, man, I gotta go make more.
-Hey, Mon.

73
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:11,432
Make some more lasagna too. Something
might have happened to a chunk of it.

74
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,506
Ross, the neighbors ate all my candy.

75
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,306
Mine stole my newspaper.

76
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,074
It's like a crime wave.

77
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,450
Phoebe, you got a second?

78
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,817
Sure.

79
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,059
Ever since you told me
about that bike...

80
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,490
I couldn't stop thinking about it.

81
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:35,395
I mean, everyone should have
a first bike, you know? So...

82
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:42,071
Oh, my God, Ross!

83
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,206
-You like it?
-I love it!

84
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,707
-Yeah?
-Oh, oh, God..

85
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,970
And I love you.

86
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,849
Not that way.

87
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,678
But the bike got you a lot closer.

88
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,117
Well, take it downstairs.

89
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,187
You know, give it a test drive.

90
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,552
Okay. Oh, my God.

91
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,927
My first bike!

92
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:06,221
Thank you for the best present
I've ever gotten.

93
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,356
You're welcome.

94
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,797
Oh, and Chandler's about to cry.

95
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,269
Am not.

96
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,073
Who is that?

97
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,406
Don't worry, I'm brave.

98
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:26,949
I.. I am brave.

99
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,284
No, no, no, no!

100
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,821
Can you tell me who is there, please?

101
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,589
My name's Gary. I live upstairs.

102
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,229
-Hi.
-Hi.

103
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:44,665
-Do you know what time it is?
-It's candy time.

104
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,599
My roommate says they taste
like little drops of heaven.

105
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,673
Oh, please.

106
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,841
Did you hear that?
"Little drops of heaven."

107
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,972
Four a.m.

108
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,411
So can I get some candy?

109
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:03,850
I am sorry, but some of us
have to get up early and go to work.

110
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:07,622
He does not know
that I am not "some of us."

111
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,754
I'm sorry, but I'll put some out
in the morning.

112
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,331
Okay, I'll swing by later.

113
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,432
You live in this building?

114
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,503
Seems like I'd remember you.

115
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,574
Night, Gar.

116
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,289
So did you read your evaluation yet?

117
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,859
No, it was marked "confidential."

118
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,120
I just sent it to human resources.

119
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:52,402
Please, you're kidding, right?
I wrote that one as a joke for you.

120
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,469
A joke they would appreciate?

121
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:57,040
I'm thinking, no.

122
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,113
-What did you say?
-I said you were a good kisser...

123
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:06,649
and that I liked your
teeny, tiny tushy.

124
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,815
No, not my tushy.

125
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:11,148
It gets worse.

126
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,484
About your initiative, I wrote:

127
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:17,026
"He was able to unhook my bra
with minimal supervision."

128
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:22,893
Under problems with performance,
I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not."

129
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:27,564
And then.. And then I drew
a little smiley face.

130
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:31,004
And then a small pornographic sketch.

131
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:43,221
That is so sweet of you
to get Phoebe that bike.

132
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,720
When I heard the story,
I almost cried.

133
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,415
Almost cried, huh?

134
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,025
Hear that, Chandler? "Almost" cried.

135
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,529
Hey, you cry every time
somebody talks about Titanic.

136
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,301
Those two had only each other.

137
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,904
She really likes it, huh?

138
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,700
Oh, yeah. I saw her
walking it down the street.

139
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,969
She had these flowers in the basket.
It was so cute.

140
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:08,975
I saw her this morning,
walking it by the park.

141
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,907
Wait, she was walking the bike?

142
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,779
Both times?

143
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,249
-Hey, Phoebe.
-Oh, hi!

144
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,290
-Hey, so you enjoying the bike?
-Oh, uh-huh, so much.

145
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:27,091
Phoebe, you do know how
to ride a bike, don't you?

146
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,459
Of course.

147
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:33,637
Can we see you ride it?

148
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,329
Okay.

149
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,289
See?

150
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,597
I told you not to get
involved with your assistant.

151
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:06,169
There's no such thing as a secret
when it comes to affairs.

152
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,165
Did you hear that, Chandler?

153
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,341
No such thing.

154
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,741
What happened? I'm just eating candy.

155
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,350
Maybe it's not that bad. They might
not take it the way I meant it.

156
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:25,284
Absolutely, you know?
Because "tushy" can mean both ass...

157
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,048
and good worker.

158
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,954
I just gotta get the thing back.

159
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:33,131
Rach? That sketch you mentioned?

160
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,960
Might it have looked
a little like this?

161
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,132
Oh, my God, Joey!

162
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,305
-What is the matter with you?
-God!

163
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:47,936
This little talent came in handy
before I could afford porn.

164
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:57,555
Hi, I'm sorry. I know it's
after hours, but I really need candy.

165
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,050
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
See? Rules are rules.

166
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,252
Please, I have people coming
from out of town today.

167
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:07,330
-I told them all about your candy.
-You're kidding.

168
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:10,592
Out-of-towners, huh?
What did you tell them?

169
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:14,204
I told them your candy
was absolutely indescribable.

170
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:19,433
Some people have said it's "little
drops of heaven." But whatever.

171
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,971
-Please, can't you help me out?
-Hey, Chandler, do we know that lady?

172
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:28,210
Isn't she the woman who lives
below you and has sex really loud?

173
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,649
All right, I'll do it just this once.

174
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,121
-But you can't tell anyone.
-Please, just give it to me.

175
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,487
Yeah, that's her.

176
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,320
-Thank you.
-Unbelievable!

177
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,966
I can't believe that sign didn't work.

178
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,160
You know what would work?
Stop making candy.

179
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,402
But they like it.

180
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,673
You mean they like you.

181
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:51,999
Maybe.

182
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,643
Is that why you became a chef,
so people would like you?

183
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:59,909
You want to talk about getting
people to like you, huh, funny man?

184
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:12,859
Just remember everything
I taught you and you'll be fine.

185
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,828
Okay? Here we go.

186
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,934
Ready, set..

187
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:20,070
Wait, this seat
is really uncomfortable.

188
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,433
Maybe before we start
we should just get another one.

189
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:27,077
Perhaps like an airplane seat,
or a beanbag chair!

190
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:32,177
You can't get out of this.
You have to learn how to ride a bike.

191
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:35,285
Why? Why do I have to learn?

192
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:40,691
-Well, in case of an emergency.
-What kind of emergency?

193
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:45,353
Well, what if a man comes along
and puts a gun to your head and says:

194
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,226
"You ride this bike or I'll..

195
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,934
I'll shoot you."

196
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,702
I would ring the bell to distract him.

197
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:57,569
Then I would knock the gun away
with a Chinese throwing star.

198
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:01,975
Okay, Phoebe, just get on the bike...

199
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:06,048
and, hey, I'll hold you up
and push you. Okay?

200
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,909
You won't let go?

201
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,485
-No.
-You swear?

202
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:11,951
I swear.

203
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,624
-Okay.
-Come on.

204
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:20,187
Here we go. All right?

205
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,457
All right?

206
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,658
Feel good?
All right, try pedaling.

207
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,999
That's it, you're doing great.
Yes, take control.

208
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,503
Yes, yes, yes!

209
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,744
Oh, no!

210
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,778
You swore!

211
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:41,646
-I just thought you were doing so well.
-I am shocked. Shocked!

212
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,749
It's a legitimate learning technique.

213
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,260
Wow.

214
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:04,174
Hey, there's some people outside
asking about candy.

215
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:07,709
They'll just have to wait, okay?
I only got two hands!

216
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,274
-Need some help?
-No, you don't know the system.

217
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,974
I don't need nobody messing
with the system!

218
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,881
By the way, the week before your
wedding, you may not see a lot of me.

219
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,232
Oh, hello, liar.

220
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,707
Look, I'm really sorry
I let go of the bike.

221
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,935
I could've been killed, you know.

222
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,711
I know, I know.

223
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,578
But can we please try it again?

224
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:50,185
I mean, you were so close, Phoebe.

225
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,949
Well, I would love to...

226
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,957
but the bike got stolen
and the police have no suspects.

227
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,699
-Phoebe.
-What?

228
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:09,638
What the hell?

229
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:12,201
You know what?

230
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,539
If you won't learn how to ride,
then I'm sorry...

231
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,773
-I have to take it back.
-But why?

232
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,348
Because it's...

233
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,621
It'd be like you having this guitar...

234
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,621
and never playing it.

235
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,760
Okay, this guitar wants to be played.

236
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:34,090
And this bike wants to be ridden.

237
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,596
And if you don't ride it...

238
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:40,896
you're killing its spirit.

239
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,170
The bike...

240
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,772
is dying.

241
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:55,310
All right. If you care enough
to make up that load of crap, okay.

242
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,186
Great.

243
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,817
You're making the bike very happy.

244
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,289
Okay, Ross.

245
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,029
Please don't die!

246
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,128
To get the evaluation
before they see it...

247
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:18,902
we gotta get into Zelner's office.
He doesn't get in until 10.

248
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:23,138
But his assistant, Betty, comes in
early to eat breakfast at her desk.

249
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:26,614
-That's kind of sad.
-Yeah, well, Betty's kind of sad.

250
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:30,785
Which is why I believe I can lure
her away with these chocolates.

251
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,417
While I distract her, you go in.

252
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:35,991
-Got it.
-Let's roll.

253
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:39,926
Hello, Rachel. You got a minute?

254
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,465
Yeah, sure, Mr. Zelner.
For you? Anything. Minute.

255
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,500
Okay, great.

256
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,330
Abort the plan.

257
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,802
Actually, I'd like to speak
to both of you.

258
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,471
Okay.

259
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:58,039
Well, can we get you anything,
Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates.

260
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:02,349
No, thanks,
but I'll give these to Betty.

261
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,052
So, I read your evaluation of Tag.

262
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:10,659
Or, to use his full name,
Tag "Sweet Cheeks" Jones?

263
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,559
Is something going on with you two?

264
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:20,198
Oh, my God,
can you imagine if there was?

265
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:25,535
I mean, what would happen exactly?

266
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,203
Well, I'd be forced to file a report.

267
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:32,111
I'd have to consult
with the legal department.

268
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:35,616
And your future at the company
would be in jeopardy.

269
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,347
-Well..
-Mr. Zelner...

270
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,219
I filled in that evaluation.

271
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,758
-Oh, no..
-Yeah, yeah.

272
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,019
I thought it would be funny.

273
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:49,199
You wrote that you have a cute tushy?

274
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,760
Yes.

275
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,438
I have a weird sense of humor.

276
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:57,197
And I'm kind of strangely
proud of my butt.

277
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,874
It's kind of a risky joke, Tag.

278
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:04,209
What is this drawing?
I can't figure it out.

279
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,749
It's upside down, you gotta..
It doesn't matter.

280
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:11,645
It's not like I don't have
a sense of humor.

281
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:15,451
Hell, I even enjoy a
naughty limerick every now and then.

282
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,724
There's a time and a place.

283
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:24,429
Unless you have a limerick right now.

284
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,770
No? Okay.
Well, you've got my fax number.

285
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,411
I can't believe you did that.
That was sweet.

286
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,487
-Don't worry about it.
-You could've lost your job.

287
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,953
Are you kidding me? With this
cute butt, I'd find work.

288
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,130
Thank you, you're great.

289
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,133
-You know what?
-What?

290
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,198
I feel great.

291
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,702
In fact...

292
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,468
What?

293
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:11,081
It's just.. It took me so long
to get that desk organized.

294
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,213
I'm sorry.

295
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,287
There it is.

296
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,361
What is going on?

297
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:32,968
We're waiting for the candy.
Bring out the candy!

298
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,538
Yeah, lady, give us candy.

299
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,133
Joey!

300
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,205
-What's up, buddy?
-What are you doing?

301
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,507
Waiting to get candy.

302
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,811
Get in here.

303
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,555
Hey, and you cannot smoke in here.

304
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,424
Merry Christmas.

305
00:19:56,662 --> 00:20:00,860
The candy is coming! I need
another 15 minutes for it to cool.

306
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:07,031
All right, everybody, just be quiet.
Be quiet! Be quiet! Pipe down!

307
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,366
What is the matter with you people?

308
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,703
This woman was trying to do a nice
thing for you.

309
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:16,369
She was making candy
so she could get to know all of you...

310
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:20,040
and I'll bet that not one of you
can tell me her name.

311
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,719
Am I right?

312
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,286
Candy Lady?

313
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,923
No, not "Candy Lady."

314
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,060
If we know it, can we have candy?

315
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,960
All right, you know what?

316
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,725
Forget it, you've ruined it.

317
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:38,960
Go home. You've ruined it.

318
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:42,935
That's all wrong! You guys
ruined everything. You ruined it!

319
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,306
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

320
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,478
Did you smoke?

321
00:20:56,188 --> 00:21:01,592
No, smokes-a-lot lady blew smoke
directly into my mouth.

322
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,959
Are you okay?

323
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,790
Fine, but it was
really scary for a while.

324
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,093
Someone slipped a threatening
note under the door!

325
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:14,238
Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.
Mob mentality or whatever.

326
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:28,414
I can't believe it. I did it.
I rode a bike!

327
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:31,579
I never thought I'd be able
to do that. Thank you.

328
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,156
Oh, hey, don't thank me.
Thank yourself.

329
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:38,193
You're the one who faced your fears
and ultimately overcame them.

330
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:42,265
Don't be so corny, Ross.
It's not an After School Special.

1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,033
-Hey.
-Hi.

2
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:10,336
-What are you doing?
-I was thinking of moving the couch.

3
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:11,908
Why would you want to do that?

4
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:14,546
So there'd be a decent place
for me to sit?

5
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:20,079
-Rach, there is a decent place.
-And your lap does not count.

6
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:24,617
-Come on, help me move this.
-No, no, no.

7
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,184
-No?
-No.

8
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:28,088
Rosita does not move.

9
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:33,592
I'm sorry. Rosita? As in..?

10
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,165
As in "Rosita does not move."

11
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:38,529
It's just a chair.
What's the big deal?

12
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:42,230
It's the exact equal distance
from the bathroom to the kitchen...

13
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:47,538
and it's at an angle where you
don't get any glare coming off Stevie.

14
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:50,011
Stevie the TV?

15
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,285
-Is there a problem?
-No.

16
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:58,852
What does he know?

17
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:02,288
Come on, Rosita.
Us chicas gotta stick together.

18
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:13,471
You bitch!

19
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,536
The One Where Rosita Dies

20
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,302
Hey, Ross?

21
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:56,981
I checked the real estate section.

22
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,944
Look at this.

23
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,881
Looks like Mom and Dad's house.

24
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:04,521
Even has a tree
with a broken limb out front.

25
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:08,591
And the window in the attic...

26
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:11,057
Oh, my God!

27
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:14,523
What happened
to the window in the attic?

28
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:19,194
-I can't believe they're selling it.
-And they didn't tell us.

29
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,999
What happened
to the window in the attic?

30
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,042
I'll buy you a new one, okay?

31
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:29,715
We'll go to the store and get you
a new chair right now.

32
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,547
She's not even cold yet.

33
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:40,351
Wouldn't Rosita have
wanted you to move on?

34
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:45,053
I mean, you know, she did always
put your comfort first.

35
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,700
That's true.

36
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:56,940
I can't believe we have to say goodbye
to the house we grew up in.

37
00:02:57,143 --> 00:03:00,044
Man, some stranger's gonna be
in my room.

38
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:03,146
For 15 years they kept it
as a shrine to you.

39
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,874
It's time the velvet ropes came down.

40
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:08,576
They kept your room a while.

41
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:13,384
Please! Dad turned my room into
a gym 20 minutes after I moved out.

42
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:17,756
I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack
of Victoria's Secret catalogs?

43
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,329
Not a gym.

44
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:23,591
-Come on. You know they love you.
-As much as they love you?

45
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:27,899
They thought she was barren
until I was born. It's not my fault.

46
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,974
I hate this year.

47
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,840
What's wrong with this year?

48
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:38,346
It's February and I've only
given two massages...

49
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,917
and they were both horrible tippers.

50
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,451
That was me and Ross.

51
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,685
Oh, that's right.

52
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,827
If you want some extra cash...

53
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:52,622
some college friends made
good money doing telemarketing.

54
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:55,999
It'd be better than the last
telephone job I had.

55
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,136
I probably won't have to say
"spank" as much.

56
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,940
What?

57
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,172
Oh, yeah, like you never called.

58
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,789
This is very easy.
You read from the script...

59
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,651
and try to sell as much
toner as you can.

60
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,520
Okay, I can do that.

61
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:25,093
By the way, I love my office.

62
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:28,391
-Why don't we do a trial run?
-Oh, okay.

63
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:31,968
All right.

64
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:35,101
Hi, this is Phoebe
from Empire Office Supplies.

65
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:39,334
-Can I speak to your supply manager?
-I'm the supply manager.

66
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,774
I'd like to talk
about your toner needs.

67
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:42,937
We don't need any.

68
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,242
Okay, sorry to bother you. Bye-bye.

69
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:47,683
Yeah, you're right. This is easy.

70
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,923
Okay. What was wrong with that call?

71
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,489
Oh, well, all right.

72
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,160
No offense,
but you were kind of rude.

73
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,565
They always say they
don't need toner. That's okay.

74
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,328
Whatever they say, you can find the
answer to it, here in the script.

75
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,072
So I think you're ready to sell toner.

76
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,300
-Do you have any last questions?
-No.

77
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,840
Wait, yes, I do have one question:

78
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,636
What is toner?

79
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,274
Joey?

80
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:22,415
Joe?

81
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,656
Full bag?

82
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,628
Beer's still cold.

83
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,461
Something terrible
must have happened here.

84
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,779
Oh, no, no, no!

85
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:53,278
Stevie, I was never here.

86
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,850
-Dad?
-I'm here!

87
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,017
-Hey.
-Hi.

88
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:06,595
Seems like just yesterday you guys
used to come out to watch me work.

89
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:09,199
We can't believe
you're selling the house.

90
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,267
Time for a new family
to start here.

91
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,734
I hope their check clears before
they find the crack...

92
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,774
in the foundation
and the asbestos in the ceiling.

93
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,579
Let's grab our stuff and
get the hell out of here.

94
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:26,552
-Sorry we can't store your things.
-Oh, it's okay.

95
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,947
I can't wait to see everything again.

96
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,122
I don't know what's down here.

97
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:35,055
But there are six or seven
Easy-Bake Ovens in the attic.

98
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,087
I used to love to play restaurant.

99
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:41,391
Not as much as you loved to play
"uncooked batter eater."

100
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:47,001
You can't expect a child to wait
for a light bulb to cook brownies.

101
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,233
So I think your boxes are over here.

102
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,843
Oh, great.

103
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,774
Hey...

104
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,006
whose cigarettes are these?

105
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,144
I don't know.

106
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,787
They must be your mother's.

107
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:08,756
But please, please don't ask her.
I'll throw these away.

108
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:16,099
Cool! Dad, my report cards!

109
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:17,734
Hey, check this out.

110
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:23,136
Math, "A." Science, "A."
History, "A." Gym...

111
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,946
My rock polisher!

112
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,680
-Uh-oh.
-What?

113
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,120
You know how the garage
floods every spring?

114
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,387
How are you ever gonna sell
this place?

115
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:46,425
I think I accidentally
used Monica's boxes...

116
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,099
to keep the water away
from the Porsche.

117
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:55,069
Oh, no, Dad. Dad?

118
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,230
What the..

119
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,810
Oh, God.
Everything's ruined!

120
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,275
Dad, she's gonna be crushed.

121
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,278
You don't secretly smoke, do you?

122
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,611
No.

123
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,951
So it's just your mother then.

124
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:19,830
Hi. This is Phoebe
from Empire Office Supplies.

125
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:22,967
Can I speak to your
supply manager, please?

126
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,004
Earl. Thanks.

127
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:30,732
Hi, Earl. This is Phoebe
from Empire Office Supplies.

128
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,537
I'd like to talk to you
about your toner needs.

129
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:36,278
I don't need any toner.

130
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:42,113
I hear what you're saying, but at
our prices, everyone needs toner.

131
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,949
Not me.

132
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,054
May I ask why?

133
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,818
You want to know why?

134
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,861
You want to know why?

135
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,998
I surely do.

136
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:55,691
Okay.

137
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,031
I don't need any toner...

138
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,330
because I'm gonna kill myself.

139
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,715
Is that because you're out of toner?

140
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,559
Okay, so no toner today.
Thanks anyway. Bye-bye.

141
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:31,326
Wait, wait! I can't let you hang up.
Just please talk to me.

142
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:32,999
Well...

143
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,207
I only had one thing to do today.

144
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,176
I guess I could push it back.

145
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,345
Yeah. Now, why do you
want to kill yourself?

146
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,978
I've been working for 10 years
now at this...

147
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,247
meaningless, dead-end job...

148
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:55,585
and nobody here
even knows that I exist.

149
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,286
Chandler?

150
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,927
I'm sorry?

151
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:07,904
Look...

152
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,632
I'm sure that people know
you exist.

153
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,003
Oh, yeah? I work in a cubicle...

154
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,712
surrounded by people.

155
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:19,111
I've been talking to you for five
minutes now about killing myself...

156
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:23,017
and no one's even looked up
from their desk. Hang on.

157
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,019
Hey, everybody...

158
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,714
I'm gonna kill myself.

159
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,727
I got nothing.

160
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,629
Good chair.

161
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:39,761
Now, if anybody asks...

162
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,769
your name is Rosita.

163
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:08,999
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.

164
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:13,297
Joey, the new chair
will be here in an hour.

165
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:16,166
Maybe we should move
Rosita out of here.

166
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,673
Start the healing process.

167
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:21,372
Yeah, I guess you're right.

168
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,861
She's healed!

169
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,030
That's weird.

170
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,709
No, it's not weird.

171
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,469
It's a miracle!

172
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,581
It's not a miracle. I'm sure
there's an explanation.

173
00:11:57,783 --> 00:12:01,981
There is. If your heart is pure,
wondrous things can happen.

174
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,219
She'll understand.
I didn't do it on purpose.

175
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:08,984
Dad, that won't matter to her.

176
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,592
Look, all my stuff is safe and dry.

177
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,298
And all her stuff is...

178
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,399
growing new stuff.

179
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,335
This is the kind of thing...

180
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:21,732
that makes her think
you love me more than her.

181
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,008
My God. Does she think that?

182
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,507
Well, can you blame her?

183
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:30,139
We may have favored you unconsciously.
You were a marvel.

184
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:33,716
-The doctors said your mom couldn't..
-I don't want to hear it.

185
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,547
-Really?
-Well, not right now.

186
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:41,349
Monica came here for some memories.
Damn it, we'll give her some.

187
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,356
Okay, grab...

188
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:46,690
Grab some boxes. We'll take stuff
from mine...

189
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:51,164
and whatever we can pass off
as hers, we'll put in there.

190
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,232
Like, this. She could have made this.

191
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,668
-This could have been hers.
-Sure.

192
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:04,409
If you want to tell the medical marvel
story while we work, that'd be fine.

193
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,581
I am so psyched
I kept this chair for myself.

194
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,654
Yeah. Me too.

195
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:25,170
You know, this thing has
speakers in the headrest?

196
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:26,735
-No, really?
-Yeah.

197
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,406
You can hook it to the TV
and you get radio.

198
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,074
My chair heals itself.

199
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,386
All right. Let's just forget about
the people at the office, okay?

200
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:46,387
There's gotta be someone
worth sticking around for.

201
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:50,551
What about family or friends?
Maybe a girlfriend?

202
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,559
Yeah, right.

203
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,823
Oh, sorry. Boyfriend?

204
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,295
Okay, I should...

205
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,095
be getting back to my thing now.

206
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,897
See you.

207
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,905
I'm not finished!
Don't you dare hang up on me!

208
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,803
The new girl's good.

209
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,413
Which boxes are mine?

210
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,143
-These are yours right here.
-Okay.

211
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,312
A coloring book.

212
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:19,213
You loved that thing.

213
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:22,155
You never went anywhere without...

214
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,293
without that coloring book.

215
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,690
Really?

216
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,559
Looks like I had trouble
staying in the lines.

217
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,291
Nuh-uh!

218
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:32,996
Wow, look at this.

219
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,070
I can't believe I even
fit into this shirt.

220
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,007
Oh, this is yours.

221
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:45,045
I don't know how that got in there.

222
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,910
Hey, this isn't my stuff.

223
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:52,487
Ross, these are your boxes.

224
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,790
Where are my boxes?

225
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:03,666
The garage flooded, sweetie,
and ruined your boxes. I'm sorry.

226
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,394
Just mine?

227
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,196
I'm afraid so.

228
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,738
Why wasn't Ross' stuff ruined?

229
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:15,309
I used your boxes to divert
water away from the Porsche.

230
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,210
Ross' stuff is fine,
but I have no memories...

231
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,409
so you could keep the bottom
of your car from water?

232
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,248
There was also
leaves and gook and stuff.

233
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:28,557
I can't believe this!

234
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,597
Screw it. I'm having one.

235
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,374
-Hey, Chandler.
-Hey.

236
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:47,739
How'd you like to sit
in a chair that reclines...

237
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,038
has a rolling massage...

238
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,580
and speakers in the headrest?

239
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,844
I've tried that so many times...

240
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:57,954
they won't even let me
in the store anymore.

241
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:02,755
What if I said you could
do it in my apartment?

242
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,224
Are you telling me...

243
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,796
you bought the chair
that makes all others obsolete?

244
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:12,800
The chair that Sit Magazine called
"Chair of the Year"?

245
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,664
I just purchased...

246
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:20,106
the La-Z-Boy E-Cliner 3000.

247
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,576
Well, that's awesome! That's great!
What made you do it?

248
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,750
It's a long story, but,
I broke Joey's chair..

249
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,647
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You broke Joey's chair?

250
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:32,254
I thought I did, that's why
I replaced it with mine.

251
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:36,383
That's how it got fixed!

252
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,957
You thought that elves
came in and fixed it?

253
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,530
No.

254
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,631
Angels.

255
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,761
I'm getting my chair back.

256
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,209
Well, looks like
it wasn't healed after all!

257
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:57,040
I guess this chair's mine now.

258
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,013
Joey, you broke my chair!

259
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,210
Your chair?

260
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:06,424
He thought he broke it,
so he switched chairs.

261
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,320
So there was no miracle?

262
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,324
No, Joe. No miracle.

263
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,563
Oh, no! This is devastating!

264
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:18,836
My faith is shaken. I'm glad I have
a new chair to get me through this.

265
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,433
Where can I find Earl?
He's the supply manager here.

266
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,076
I don't know any Earl.

267
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:29,576
I'm right here!

268
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,384
Earl?

269
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,586
I'm Phoebe.

270
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,188
Phoebe?

271
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,757
The lady who sells toner?

272
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,656
Look, you can't kill yourself.

273
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,026
Look, I really appreciate
you coming down..

274
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,894
No, I can't let you do it.

275
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:54,367
-Why?
-Because, fate made me call you today.

276
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,268
I thought it was toner.

277
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,277
Think about it, okay?
This isn't even my regular job.

278
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,681
My first day, you're my first call.

279
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,478
Somebody else may have hung up,
but I wouldn't do that...

280
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,551
because I know about this stuff.

281
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,485
-My mom killed herself.
-Really?

282
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:14,881
How?

283
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,686
I'm not gonna give you tips.

284
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,494
Don't you see that this...

285
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:24,567
all came together so I could
stop you from doing this?

286
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:29,134
-Couldn't it just be a coincidence?
-No, it's fate.

287
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:33,102
It doesn't really seem like
enough to be fate.

288
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,504
Oh, well.

289
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,578
Okay, here's a weird thing.

290
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:40,911
My mother was also a supply manager.

291
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,319
I'm actually the office manager.

292
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,547
Oh, my God! So was she!

293
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,953
And get this, okay.

294
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:52,823
Your name is Earl, right?
Her name was Pearl.

295
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,293
Puh-Earl.

296
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,263
Was there anything else?

297
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,528
Sure.

298
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,296
Where're you from?

299
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:06,170
-Philadelphia.
-Oh, my God, so was she!

300
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:09,843
I've got goose bumps.

301
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,304
Really?

302
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,643
I'm wearing layers, and it's warm.

303
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,551
These jerks might not care about you...

304
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:21,657
but the universe does,
and that says a lot.

305
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,323
Did you hear that?

306
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,299
I don't need you guys
to care about me...

307
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,593
because the universe cares!

308
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,168
The whole universe!

309
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:41,603
I really wish they'd care
a little bit.

310
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,946
Oh, this is terrible.

311
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,175
Everything is destroyed.

312
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,609
Look at this.

313
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:54,087
It meant enough for me to save,
and now I can't tell what it is.

314
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,386
It's still soft.

315
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,798
What do you think this is?

316
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:05,333
I think it was a mouse.

317
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,745
-How are you, honey?
-How do you think I am?

318
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,416
You've wrecked my childhood memories...

319
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,346
you love Ross more than me.

320
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,418
And I just rubbed
a dead mouse on my face.

321
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:30,925
Sweetheart, we love you
just as much as Ross.

322
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,063
I'm sorry about what happened...

323
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:36,733
and I probably can't
make it up to you...

324
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,833
but here's a start.

325
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,868
-What's this?
-It's the key to my Porsche.

326
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,238
Well, the key to your Porsche.

327
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,505
What?

328
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,342
What?!

329
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:57,411
I've considered getting rid of it.
I saw my reflection the other day.

330
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:00,852
Your mother's right,
I do look like an ass.

331
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:04,689
You're giving it to me?
You're kidding.

332
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,865
Well, wait a minute.

333
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:11,763
A couple of stupid boxes get wet,
and she gets a Porsche?

334
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:15,896
-Let's take a drive?
-All right!

335
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,737
What about me? I'm a medical marvel!

336
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,723
Hey, guys.

337
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,792
Have you seen Chandler's chair?

338
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,055
Joey broke it. He got rid of it.

339
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:44,463
Are you kidding? I get a Porsche
and the Barcalounger's gone?

340
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,764
This is the best day ever!

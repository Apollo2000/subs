1
00:00:00,931 --> 00:00:03,102
- I don't know.
- What?

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:05,721
Well, as old as he is
in dog years...

3
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:09,272
... do you think Snoopy should
still be allowed to fly this thing?

4
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:11,547
- Rachel?
- Yeah?

5
00:00:11,747 --> 00:00:15,424
You remember when you first came here,
how you spent two weeks getting trained?

6
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:18,238
Sure. Do you need me
to train somebody new?

7
00:00:19,523 --> 00:00:20,635
Good one.

8
00:00:21,827 --> 00:00:26,715
Actually, Terry wants you to take
the training again. Whenever.

9
00:00:30,243 --> 00:00:31,901
Do you believe that?

10
00:00:37,315 --> 00:00:38,263
Yeah.

11
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:46,336

14
00:01:26,943 --> 00:01:30,009
So that's two boxes
of the Holiday Macaroons.

15
00:01:30,815 --> 00:01:34,709
On behalf of the Brown Birds of America,
I salute you.

16
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,254
Just admit it, Chandler.
You have no backhand.

17
00:01:39,455 --> 00:01:42,172
Excuse me, little one.
I have a very solid backhand.

18
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:45,528
Shielding your face
and shrieking like a girl...

19
00:01:45,823 --> 00:01:47,448
... is not a backhand.

20
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,486
I was shrieking...

21
00:01:50,815 --> 00:01:51,895
... like a Marine.

22
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,203
All right, here. Watch me execute
the three P's of championship play.

23
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,511
Power.

24
00:02:00,415 --> 00:02:01,363
Precision.

25
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:02,903
And panache.

26
00:02:07,423 --> 00:02:09,278
You broke a little girl's leg?

27
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:12,060
I know. I feel horrible, okay?

28
00:02:12,255 --> 00:02:16,084
It says here that a Muppet got whacked
on Sesame Street last night.

29
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:20,119
Where exactly were you around 10-ish?

30
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:24,214
Well, I'm gonna go see her.
I wanna bring her something.

31
00:02:24,383 --> 00:02:26,903
- What do you think she'd like?
- Maybe a Hello Kitty doll?

32
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:29,240
The ability to walk?

33
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,645
I'm gonna get back to re-training.

34
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,886
All right. See you guys.

35
00:02:37,086 --> 00:02:38,842
Look out, kids! He's coming!

36
00:02:41,983 --> 00:02:43,805
And I gotta go sell
some Christmas trees.

37
00:02:44,127 --> 00:02:46,516
Have fun.
Wait! No, don't!

38
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:49,817
I forgot. I am totally
against that now.

39
00:02:50,782 --> 00:02:53,368
What? Me having a job?

40
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:57,690
No. No, I am against innocent trees
being cut down in their prime...

41
00:02:57,983 --> 00:03:00,666
... and their corpses
grotesquely dressed...

42
00:03:00,895 --> 00:03:03,382
... in, like, tinsel and twinkly lights.

43
00:03:04,063 --> 00:03:05,918
Hey, how do you sleep at night?

44
00:03:06,111 --> 00:03:09,624
Well, I'm pretty tired
from lugging the trees around.

45
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,174
Hey, Phoebe, listen.
You got this all wrong.

46
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:16,374
Those trees were born
to be Christmas trees.

47
00:03:16,575 --> 00:03:20,437
They're fulfilling their life purpose
by making people happy.

48
00:03:20,703 --> 00:03:21,750
Really?

49
00:03:23,807 --> 00:03:25,662
Yes.

50
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,958
Yes, and the trees are happy too...

51
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:30,294
... because, for most of them,
it's their only...

52
00:03:30,623 --> 00:03:32,183
... chance to see New York.

53
00:03:35,902 --> 00:03:38,106
After you've delivered the drinks,
take the tray...

54
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:41,716
Gunther, please. I have worked here
for two and a half years.

55
00:03:41,983 --> 00:03:44,503
I know the empty trays go over there.

56
00:03:44,798 --> 00:03:47,733
What if you put them here?

57
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:52,947
You know, that's actually a good idea.
They'll be closer to the mugs.

58
00:03:53,151 --> 00:03:56,599
You know what? You should have
the other waitresses do that too.

59
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,938
They already do.

60
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,500
That's why they call it the tray spot.

61
00:04:01,695 --> 00:04:03,670
Jeez, I always heard them
talk about that.

62
00:04:03,871 --> 00:04:07,668
I sort of just thought it was, like,
a club they went to. Oh, God.

63
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:11,068
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

64
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:14,774
Sweetheart.

65
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:20,438
So this must be
kind of neat for you, huh?

66
00:04:20,735 --> 00:04:23,190
Your dad tells me you get
a couple of days off school...

67
00:04:23,391 --> 00:04:26,425
... and you don't have to sell
those cookies anymore.

68
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,106
Well, I kind of wanted
to sell the cookies.

69
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,692
The girl who sells the most
wins a trip to Space Camp...

70
00:04:32,927 --> 00:04:35,066
... and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.

71
00:04:35,263 --> 00:04:39,486
Wow, you really like
all this space stuff, huh?

72
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:43,287
Yeah. My dad says if I spend as much
time helping him clean apartments...

73
00:04:43,487 --> 00:04:45,789
... as I do daydreaming
about outer space...

74
00:04:45,982 --> 00:04:48,666
... he'd be able to afford
a trip to the Taj Mahal.

75
00:04:48,862 --> 00:04:52,888
I think you'd have to clean a whole lot
of apartments to go all the way to India.

76
00:04:53,087 --> 00:04:56,087
No. The one in Atlantic City.
Dad loves the slots.

77
00:04:58,143 --> 00:05:01,438
He says he's gonna double the
college money my grandma left me.

78
00:05:03,935 --> 00:05:06,171
Well, good luck to Dad.

79
00:05:08,222 --> 00:05:12,532
Say, how many more boxes would
you have to sell in order to win?

80
00:05:12,735 --> 00:05:16,891
- The girl who won last year sold 475.
- Yeah?

81
00:05:17,087 --> 00:05:19,836
So far, I've sold 75.

82
00:05:22,431 --> 00:05:24,667
Four hundred, huh?

83
00:05:24,927 --> 00:05:28,222
Well, that sounds doable.
How much are the boxes?

84
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:29,495
Five dollars a box.

85
00:05:30,111 --> 00:05:32,315
And what is second prize?

86
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:36,949
A 10-speed bike. But I'd rather have
something my dad couldn't sell.

87
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,979
Well, that makes sense.

88
00:05:41,183 --> 00:05:42,612
Could you do me one favor?

89
00:05:42,815 --> 00:05:45,433
- Lf it's not too much trouble.
- Yeah, Sarah. Anything.

90
00:05:45,631 --> 00:05:47,486
Could you pull the curtains open for me?

91
00:05:47,678 --> 00:05:50,329
The astronauts from the space
shuttle are gonna be on the news.

92
00:05:50,527 --> 00:05:52,894
Since we don't have a TV,
the lady across the alley...

93
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:56,403
... said she'd push hers up
to her window so I can watch it.

94
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,496
Yes?

95
00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:12,150
Yeah, hi. I'm selling
Brown Bird cookies.

96
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:16,726
You're no Brown Bird.
I can see you through my peephole.

97
00:06:17,983 --> 00:06:22,173
No. Hi. I'm an honorary Brown Bird.

98
00:06:24,991 --> 00:06:26,136
What does that mean?

99
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:32,028
Well, it means that I can sell cookies,
but I'm not invited to sleepovers.

100
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,719
I can dial 911 at the press
of a button, you know.

101
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,096
Now, go away!

102
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,977
Please, please.
It's for a poor little girl...

103
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:45,501
... who wants to go to Space Camp
more than anything in the world.

104
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:47,067
I'm pressing.

105
00:06:47,294 --> 00:06:49,301
A policeman is on his way.

106
00:06:49,503 --> 00:06:51,924
Okay, okay.
I'm going, I'm going.

107
00:06:56,991 --> 00:06:58,398
I can still see you!

108
00:06:58,591 --> 00:06:59,573
All right!

109
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,559
- Hey.
- Hey.

110
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,806
What are you doing here?

111
00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:09,428
Well, I thought
a lot about what you said...

112
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,979
... and I realize maybe
I was a little judgmental.

113
00:07:13,247 --> 00:07:15,319
Yeah. But...

114
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,820
Now, Phoebe, remember, hey...

115
00:07:18,014 --> 00:07:20,185
... they're just fulfilling
their Christmas...

116
00:07:20,383 --> 00:07:21,757
- Destiny. Yes.
- Sure.

117
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,666
Okay.

118
00:07:25,023 --> 00:07:27,870
Yikes. That one
doesn't look very fulfilled.

119
00:07:28,063 --> 00:07:31,096
That's one of the old ones.
He's just taking it to the back.

120
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,628
You keep the old ones in the back?

121
00:07:33,823 --> 00:07:36,027
That is so ageist.

122
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:41,211
- We have to make room for the fresh ones.
- So, what happens to the old guys?

123
00:07:41,726 --> 00:07:43,133
Well, they go into the chipper.

124
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:47,380
Why do I have a feeling
that's not as happy as it sounds?

125
00:08:03,998 --> 00:08:06,420
These come in the shapes of your
favorite Christmas characters.

126
00:08:06,622 --> 00:08:09,143
Santa, Rudolph and baby Jesus.

127
00:08:10,878 --> 00:08:13,529
All right. I'll take a box
of the cream-filled Jesuses.

128
00:08:14,783 --> 00:08:18,263
Wait a minute. One box? Come on. I'm
trying to send a little girl to Space Camp.

129
00:08:18,462 --> 00:08:21,245
I'm putting you down for five boxes.
Chandler, what about you?

130
00:08:21,438 --> 00:08:25,530
All right. Do you have any
coconut-flavored deities?

131
00:08:25,726 --> 00:08:29,883
No, but there's coconut
in the Hanukkah Menorah-eos.

132
00:08:30,655 --> 00:08:34,168
I'll tell you what. I'll put you down
for eight boxes. One for each night.

133
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:35,294
Mon?

134
00:08:35,486 --> 00:08:39,480
All right. I'll take one box of
the Mint Treasures. One, and that's it.

135
00:08:39,774 --> 00:08:42,709
I started gaining weight after
I joined the Brown Birds. Remember?

136
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:46,172
Dad bought every one
of my boxes, and I ate them all.

137
00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:49,852
No, Mon. Dad had to buy
every one of your boxes...

138
00:08:50,047 --> 00:08:51,989
... because you ate them all.

139
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:58,777
But, you know, I'm sure that's
not gonna happen this time.

140
00:08:58,974 --> 00:09:01,527
Why don't I put you down
for three of the Mint Treasures...

141
00:09:01,727 --> 00:09:03,417
... and just a couple of the Rudolphs.

142
00:09:03,614 --> 00:09:05,108
No.

143
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,006
Come on, now.
You know you want them.

144
00:09:10,206 --> 00:09:12,410
Don't. Don't do this.

145
00:09:12,606 --> 00:09:17,014
I'll tell you what, Mon.
I'll give you the first box for free.

146
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:19,800
Oh, God! I gotta go!

147
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:23,098
Come on. All the cool kids
are eating them.

148
00:09:24,927 --> 00:09:28,188
When you have a second, I want to show
you why we don't just trap spiders...

149
00:09:28,382 --> 00:09:30,968
... under coffee mugs
and leave them there.

150
00:09:34,111 --> 00:09:38,366
I'm training to be better at a job
that I hate. My life officially sucks.

151
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,413
Wasn't this supposed
to be a temporary thing?

152
00:09:40,606 --> 00:09:44,665
- I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff.
- Well, yeah. I'm still pursuing that.

153
00:09:45,214 --> 00:09:47,549
How, exactly, are you pursuing that?

154
00:09:47,742 --> 00:09:51,637
You know, other than sending out
resumes, like, what? Two years ago?

155
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:55,133
Well, I'm also sending out...

156
00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:57,530
... good thoughts.

157
00:09:58,623 --> 00:10:01,273
If you ask me,
as long as you got this job...

158
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,892
... you got nothing pushing you
to get another one.

159
00:10:04,094 --> 00:10:06,330
You need The Fear.

160
00:10:06,526 --> 00:10:08,119
- The Fear?
- He's right.

161
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:09,725
If you quit this job, you then...

162
00:10:09,918 --> 00:10:12,853
... have motivation to go after
a job you really want.

163
00:10:13,054 --> 00:10:14,615
Why are you still at a job you hate?

164
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,498
I mean, why don't you quit
and get The Fear?

165
00:10:18,654 --> 00:10:20,956
Because I'm too afraid.

166
00:10:22,783 --> 00:10:23,677
I don't know.

167
00:10:23,902 --> 00:10:28,125
I mean, I would give anything to work
for a designer, you know, or a buyer.

168
00:10:28,318 --> 00:10:30,740
I just don't want to be 30
and still work here.

169
00:10:30,942 --> 00:10:35,612
Yeah, that'd be much worse than
being 28 and still working here.

170
00:10:35,807 --> 00:10:37,595
- Rachel?
- Yeah?

171
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:41,915
Remind me to review with you which
pot is decaf and which is regular.

172
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,597
Can't I just look at the handles on them?

173
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,448
You would think.

174
00:10:48,095 --> 00:10:51,892
Okay, fine. Gunther, you know what?
I am a terrible waitress.

175
00:10:52,158 --> 00:10:55,933
Do you know why I'm a terrible
waitress? Because I don't care.

176
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,510
I don't care. I don't care which pot
is regular and which pot is decaf.

177
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,166
I don't care where the tray spot is.
I just don't care.

178
00:11:02,366 --> 00:11:04,733
This is not what I want to do.

179
00:11:05,886 --> 00:11:08,788
So I don't think I should do it anymore.

180
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,286
- I'm gonna give you my week's notice.
- What?

181
00:11:12,478 --> 00:11:14,333
Gunther, I quit.

182
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:19,124
Does this mean we're gonna
have to start paying for coffee?

183
00:11:23,331 --> 00:11:24,640
Okay, 12.

184
00:11:25,474 --> 00:11:26,685
Twenty-two.

185
00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:28,443
Eighteen.

186
00:11:33,058 --> 00:11:33,986
What?

187
00:11:34,178 --> 00:11:35,902
I spelled out "boobies. "

188
00:11:40,322 --> 00:11:44,064
Ross? Put me down for another box
of the Mint Treasures, okay?

189
00:11:44,258 --> 00:11:46,647
Where are the Mint Treasures?

190
00:11:47,394 --> 00:11:49,281
We're out. I sold them all.

191
00:11:49,795 --> 00:11:51,223
What?

192
00:11:51,426 --> 00:11:53,695
Monica, I'm cutting you off.

193
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,991
No.

194
00:11:57,186 --> 00:11:58,779
No.

195
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,923
Just a couple more boxes.

196
00:12:02,754 --> 00:12:05,143
It's no big deal, all right? I'm cool.

197
00:12:06,883 --> 00:12:09,501
You gotta help me out
with a couple more boxes!

198
00:12:10,626 --> 00:12:12,928
Mon, look at yourself.
You have cookie on your neck.

199
00:12:13,443 --> 00:12:14,370
Oh, God!

200
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,257
- So how many you sold so far?
- Check this out.

201
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,542
- Five hundred and seventeen boxes.
- Oh, my God. How did you do that?

202
00:12:24,738 --> 00:12:26,909
Okay, the other night
I was leaving the museum...

203
00:12:27,106 --> 00:12:31,067
... just as Laser Floyd was letting out
of the planetarium.

204
00:12:31,491 --> 00:12:34,076
Without even trying, I sold 50 boxes.

205
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:37,753
That's when it occurred to me.
The key to my success: The munchies.

206
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:43,998
So I started hitting
the NYU dorms around midnight.

207
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,895
I am selling cookies by the case.

208
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,538
They call me "Cookie Dude. "

209
00:12:53,638 --> 00:12:57,347
Okay. Stop what you're doing. I need
envelope stuffers. I need stamp lickers...

210
00:12:57,542 --> 00:13:01,120
- Hey, who did these resumes for you?
- Me. On my computer.

211
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:03,138
You sure used a large font.

212
00:13:03,398 --> 00:13:05,732
Yeah. Well, "Waitress
at a Coffeehouse"...

213
00:13:05,926 --> 00:13:09,439
... and "Cheer Squad Co-Captain"
only took up so much room.

214
00:13:11,142 --> 00:13:12,419
Hey, that's funny!

215
00:13:12,614 --> 00:13:15,200
You're funny, Chandler!
You're a funny guy!

216
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,121
You know what else is really funny?

217
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:20,187
Something else I might have said?

218
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,544
I don't know. I don't know. Weren't you
the guy that told me to quit my job...

219
00:13:24,742 --> 00:13:27,841
... when I had absolutely
nothing else to do?

220
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:34,141
- Sweetie, calm down. It's gonna be okay.
- No, it's not gonna be okay, Ross.

221
00:13:34,342 --> 00:13:38,085
Tomorrow is my last day,
and I don't have a lead.

222
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:40,645
Okay. You know what?
I'm just gonna call Gunther...

223
00:13:40,838 --> 00:13:42,464
... and tell him I'm not quitting.

224
00:13:42,662 --> 00:13:45,029
You don't want to give in to The Fear.

225
00:13:45,222 --> 00:13:48,538
You and your stupid Fear.
I hate your Fear!

226
00:13:48,742 --> 00:13:51,012
I would like to take
you and your Fear...

227
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,443
Hey! I got great news.

228
00:13:53,638 --> 00:13:56,289
Run, Joey. Run for your life!

229
00:13:57,926 --> 00:14:01,243
What? Rach, listen. Have you ever
heard of Fortunata Fashions?

230
00:14:01,446 --> 00:14:02,373
No.

231
00:14:02,566 --> 00:14:05,882
My old man's doing a plumbing job there,
and he heard they have an opening.

232
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:07,973
Want to see if he
can get you an interview?

233
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:11,875
Oh, my God, yes. I would love that.
That's so sweet, Joey.

234
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,150
Not a problem.

235
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,739
And now for the great news.

236
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,632
What, that wasn't the great news?

237
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,554
Only if you think
it's better than this.

238
00:14:20,198 --> 00:14:22,107
Snow-in-a-Can!

239
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,539
I got it at work.
You want me to decorate the window?

240
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:27,490
Give it kind of a Christmas looky?

241
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:29,634
Christmas cookie?

242
00:14:34,598 --> 00:14:36,932
Okay, and this one here's
a Douglas fir.

243
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,574
Now, it's a little more money,
but you get a nicer smell.

244
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,007
Looks good. I'll take it.

245
00:14:43,206 --> 00:14:45,508
Wait, wait. No, no.
You don't want that one.

246
00:14:45,766 --> 00:14:48,930
No. You can have
this cool brown one.

247
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:52,419
It's almost dead.

248
00:14:52,614 --> 00:14:56,160
But that's why you have to buy it,
so that it can fulfill its Christmas destiny.

249
00:14:56,359 --> 00:15:00,450
Otherwise, they're gonna throw
it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey.

250
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:04,192
Yeah, the trees that don't fulfill
their Christmas destiny...

251
00:15:04,391 --> 00:15:06,627
... are thrown in the chipper.

252
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,561
I think I'm gonna look around
a little bit more.

253
00:15:11,334 --> 00:15:15,163
Pheebs. You gotta stop doing this.
I'm working on commission here.

254
00:15:16,742 --> 00:15:18,881
Hey, guys. I'm here
to pick out my Christmas tree.

255
00:15:19,142 --> 00:15:22,852
Well, look no further.
This one's yours.

256
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,899
Is this the one
that I threw out last year?

257
00:15:28,934 --> 00:15:32,829
All right. You know what? Never mind.
Everybody wants to have a green one.

258
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:37,187
Sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to get so emotional. I guess it's just...

259
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,811
The holidays are just hard.

260
00:15:39,014 --> 00:15:42,559
Oh, honey. Is that because
your mom died around Christmas?

261
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:44,994
I wasn't even thinking about that.

262
00:15:54,182 --> 00:15:57,029
Hi, there.
How many did you sell?

263
00:15:57,254 --> 00:16:01,858
I'm not gonna tell you. You're the
bad man who broke Sarah's leg.

264
00:16:02,982 --> 00:16:05,371
Hey, now. That was an accident, okay?

265
00:16:05,574 --> 00:16:06,752
You're a big scrud.

266
00:16:08,838 --> 00:16:10,212
What's a scrud?

267
00:16:10,406 --> 00:16:12,413
Why don't you look
in the mirror, scrud.

268
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:17,789
I don't have to.
I can just look at you.

269
00:16:19,142 --> 00:16:20,254
All right, girls...

270
00:16:21,446 --> 00:16:22,722
... and man.

271
00:16:24,102 --> 00:16:26,241
Let's see your final tallies.

272
00:16:27,238 --> 00:16:28,929
Debbie.

273
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:32,795
Three hundred and twenty-one
boxes of cookies. Very nice.

274
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:35,620
Not nice enough.

275
00:16:35,942 --> 00:16:37,153
Charla.

276
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,205
Two hundred and seventy-eight.

277
00:16:39,494 --> 00:16:41,250
Sorry, dear, but still good.

278
00:16:41,446 --> 00:16:44,163
Good for a scrud.

279
00:16:46,854 --> 00:16:48,196
Yes, Elizabeth.

280
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,394
Eight hundred and seventy-one.

281
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,478
That's crap!

282
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,971
Sister Brown Bird.

283
00:16:59,238 --> 00:17:01,126
Good going.

284
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,442
Who's next?

285
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,805
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

286
00:17:12,422 --> 00:17:14,364
And batting for Sarah...

287
00:17:15,206 --> 00:17:16,634
... Ross Geller.

288
00:17:17,606 --> 00:17:20,835
Eight hundred and seventy-two.

289
00:17:21,734 --> 00:17:25,825
Although, it looks like you bought
an awful lot of cookies yourself.

290
00:17:26,022 --> 00:17:28,989
That is because my doctor
says that I have...

291
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:32,419
... a very serious...

292
00:17:32,614 --> 00:17:34,785
... nougat...

293
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:38,339
... deficiency.

294
00:17:39,398 --> 00:17:41,154
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.

295
00:17:43,398 --> 00:17:47,359
Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned
her uniform to her 19-year-old sister...

296
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:52,315
... who went down to the U. S. S. Nimitz
and sold over 2000 boxes.

297
00:17:54,182 --> 00:17:57,182
- Hey, how'd the interview go?
- I blew it.

298
00:17:57,382 --> 00:17:59,716
I wouldn't have even hired me.

299
00:18:00,262 --> 00:18:01,244
Come here, sweetie.

300
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,590
Listen...

301
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:07,936
... you're gonna go on, like, a thousand
interviews before you get a job.

302
00:18:11,622 --> 00:18:14,524
That's not how that
was supposed to come out.

303
00:18:14,725 --> 00:18:16,668
This is just the worst Christmas ever.

304
00:18:17,158 --> 00:18:20,191
You know what, Rach? Maybe you
should stay here at the coffeehouse.

305
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:24,219
I can't. It's too late. Terry already
hired that girl over there.

306
00:18:24,518 --> 00:18:25,598
Look at her.

307
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:28,612
She's even got waitress experience.

308
00:18:29,158 --> 00:18:30,685
Last night she was...

309
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,932
... teaching everybody
how to make...

310
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,434
... napkins...

311
00:18:34,694 --> 00:18:37,508
... into...

312
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,758
That word was "swans. "

313
00:18:45,606 --> 00:18:50,308
Well, seeing that drunk Santa wet
himself really perked up my Christmas.

314
00:18:57,925 --> 00:18:59,452
Oh, my God!

315
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,445
Merry Christmas!

316
00:19:02,886 --> 00:19:05,024
You saved them!
You guys!

317
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:07,205
Oh, God, you're the best!

318
00:19:07,398 --> 00:19:09,918
It's like Night of the
Living Dead Christmas Trees.

319
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,878
Hello.

320
00:19:15,078 --> 00:19:17,020
Yeah, this is she.

321
00:19:18,822 --> 00:19:20,894
You're kidding. You're kidding.

322
00:19:21,446 --> 00:19:23,333
Thank you. I love you!

323
00:19:23,526 --> 00:19:25,697
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.

324
00:19:25,894 --> 00:19:27,454
I got the job!

325
00:19:27,654 --> 00:19:29,792
That's great.

326
00:19:30,213 --> 00:19:33,377
God bless us, everyone.

327
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:39,358
Here we go. Serving
my last cup of coffee.

328
00:19:46,502 --> 00:19:47,516
There you go.

329
00:19:47,782 --> 00:19:49,342
Enjoy.

330
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,849
- Should I tell her I ordered tea?
- No.

331
00:19:55,942 --> 00:19:57,185
Excuse me, everyone.

332
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,544
This is my last night working here...

333
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:02,880
... and I just wanted to say...

334
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:05,795
... that I made some
really good friends here.

335
00:20:06,118 --> 00:20:08,671
And it's just time to move on.

336
00:20:12,805 --> 00:20:15,358
And no offense to everybody
who still works here...

337
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:18,819
... but you have no idea
how good it feels to say...

338
00:20:19,014 --> 00:20:21,436
... that as of this moment...

339
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:26,242
... I will never have
to make coffee again.

340
00:20:26,438 --> 00:20:29,089
Now, Mr. Kaplan Sr.
Likes his coffee strong.

341
00:20:29,285 --> 00:20:32,547
So you're gonna use
two bags instead of one.

342
00:20:32,742 --> 00:20:35,393
See. Now, pay attention,
because this part's tricky.

343
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:40,129
See, some people use filters
just once...

344
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:49,854
I'm sorry you didn't get to go
to Space Camp...

345
00:20:50,053 --> 00:20:55,291
... and I'm hoping that maybe somehow
this may help make up for it. Okay?

346
00:20:55,494 --> 00:20:57,250
Presenting...

347
00:20:57,414 --> 00:21:00,960
... Sarah Tuddle's
Private Very Special Space Camp!

348
00:21:05,157 --> 00:21:07,165
Really, Mr. Geller,
you don't have to do this.

349
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,188
Come on, here we go.

350
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:13,538
Stand by for mission countdown.

351
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,069
Ten, ten...

352
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,447
Nine, nine, nine...

353
00:21:16,677 --> 00:21:18,106
Eight, eight, eight...

354
00:21:19,526 --> 00:21:21,314
Okay, blast off.

355
00:21:30,278 --> 00:21:32,165
I'm an alien. I'm an alien.

356
00:21:32,422 --> 00:21:33,349
Oh, no! An asteroid!

357
00:21:34,305 --> 00:22:34,802

1
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:11,305
The caterer sent me this list of 12
appetizers. I have to narrow it to 6.

2
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,638
Food? Oh, give me.

3
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:19,149
Did Monica mention we're trying to get
The Swing Kings to play the wedding?

4
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:20,979
You're into swing music?

5
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:24,816
I used to go all over town
listening to bands.

6
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:28,358
-Chandler?
-Gap commercial.

7
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:33,823
-Did you book them? Did you call?
-I will.

8
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,332
-You want me to call?
-I'll do it. You stick to your job.

9
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,507
-What is your job?
-Staying out of the way.

10
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:46,545
This is impossible.
Why don't you just pick all 15?

11
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:50,374
-There were only 12.
-Oh, yeah, I added 3.

12
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:53,211
What are "peanut-butter fingers"?

13
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,054
The One With the Cheap Wedding Dress

14
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,665
Well, hello.

15
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,670
She's cute.

16
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,036
Should we go talk to her?

17
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:56,442
Sure. Being engaged, I'm not nervous
to talk to pretty girls anymore.

18
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,708
Could you guys help me?

19
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,920
Yeah, let me get that for you.

20
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:07,957
-It's really heavy.
-I got it.

21
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:15,793
So hi, I'm Ross,
and this is my friend, Chandler.

22
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,763
I'm Kristen.

23
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,407
Hi. Are you new to the area?

24
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:25,667
I'd love to show you
around sometime.

25
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,371
I actually just moved
from four blocks over.

26
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:32,074
But this block is like another world.

27
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:36,288
Actually, it does have
a very interesting history.

28
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:41,960
This street is the first in the city
to have an underground sewer system.

29
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:45,295
Before that, sewage and waste...

30
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,762
would just flow
right down the street.

31
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:51,664
Sometimes ankle-deep.

32
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,364
Smooth.

33
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,906
Excuse me?

34
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:05,983
You're gonna be starving after moving.
What do you say I take you to dinner?

35
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,948
-I'd like that.
-Great.

36
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,416
Let me take this up.

37
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,921
-After you.
-Oh, no. After you.

38
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,458
Oh, my God!

39
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,735
Am I crazy, or does this totally go?

40
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:33,411
Oh, my God! You look so beautiful!

41
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,912
Thank you, Rachel.
But look at Monica!

42
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:41,080
This is it. Yeah, this is the one.

43
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,585
I can't believe I found it.

44
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:48,453
Wow, you look so beautiful.
If I knew you, I'd cry.

45
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:52,127
I'm Monica Geller. Bawl like a baby.

46
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,731
I'm Megan Bailey.

47
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:57,596
-Have you found your dress?
-These dresses are amazing...

48
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:01,432
-but I couldn't afford one.
-I can't either.

49
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:06,509
I'm here to figure out the one I want,
then I'll get it at Kleinman's.

50
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,940
They're having a huge sale.

51
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:12,481
-Thanks for the tip.
-When are you getting married?

52
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:17,780
-I'm not. I just like to try them on.
-I do the same thing.

53
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:22,493
I'm just kidding.
I'm getting married July 25th.

54
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,526
I'm just kidding too.

55
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:28,392
I'm getting married in December.

56
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,864
-When are you getting married?
-May 15th.

57
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,699
It's close.
Who's your photographer?

58
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,704
-Jeffrey.
-We met with him.

59
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:43,005
-Did he show you nude wedding photos?
-The Best Man? Wow!

60
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,385
I know.
I almost called off my wedding.

61
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:50,180
-Who's your band?
-My fiance wants The Swing Kings.

62
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,520
You're lucky. My fiance wants
the heavy metal band, Carcass.

63
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:59,664
Is that spelled with a "C" or a "K"?
It doesn't matter, they're both great!

64
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,493
Oh, don't buy that here.

65
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:07,332
Now that you know what you want,
go to Kleinman's.

66
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,700
This place is so overpriced.

67
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,843
I own this store.

68
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:17,005
So does this come
in another color, or...

69
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:29,824
Hi. You moving in or moving out?

70
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:32,020
-Moving in.
-Can I help out?

71
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:37,100
Okay, but be careful. The guy who was
helping before hurt his back.

72
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,698
-Boyfriend?
-No.

73
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,601
I'm Joey.

74
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,333
Kristen.

75
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:46,410
What a beautiful name.

76
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:49,339
What is it again?

77
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,046
Kristen.

78
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,217
-You live around here?
-Right down there.

79
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,287
Let me give you a tip.

80
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:03,291
Don't take a nap on this stoop.
You could wake up without shoes.

81
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,797
I'll remember that.

82
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:10,661
Listen, would you like
to have dinner with me tonight?

83
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:14,066
I have plans tonight.
How about tomorrow?

84
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,867
Sounds great.
Well, where does this go?

85
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:20,807
You look strong.
Why don't you grab one of the boxes.

86
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,949
Yeah, I'll get this one.

87
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,789
So this is Brooklyn?

88
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,095
Listen up. There's only
one dress in each size.

89
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,773
So when they open those doors,
fan out.

90
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:52,907
This is what you're looking for.
Memorize it.

91
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:58,216
When you locate the dress,
blow on these, all right?

92
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:03,551
Three sharp blasts.
When you hear it, come running.

93
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:05,780
Here he comes!

94
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:09,290
-They're pushing!
-Don't be a baby!

95
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,986
-Out of the way!
-Let's go!

96
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:15,326
Rachel?! Come on!

97
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:28,173
No, not it. Not it. Not it.

98
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,977
Don't crowd me.

99
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:38,517
This is it! This is the dress!
It's perfect!

100
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,885
I'm sorry, this one's taken!

101
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,860
-Megan!
-Monica!

102
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,724
-You came!
-Yeah!

103
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,695
-This is my dress!
-No!

104
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,871
-You saw me wearing it.
-And now you'll see me buying it.

105
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,267
You freak!

106
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,270
You wouldn't even know
about this place without me.

107
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:04,882
-Look, you don't want to fight me.
-Maybe I do. I'm pretty feisty!

108
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,612
-I'm coming! I'm coming!
-Hey!

109
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:13,985
Okay! Hey? Oh, what do I do?!

110
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:24,497
What are you doing?
Did you find the dress?

111
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,135
Did you find the dress?

112
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,704
No. You gotta get me out of here.

113
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:32,399
-We've gotta get Monica.
-You hold my hand!

114
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:36,910
Excuse me! Excuse me!

115
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:41,142
Go! Go! Go!

116
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,231
How was your date the other night?

117
00:08:55,434 --> 00:09:00,462
Did you tell her about the magical
ride that starts with every flush?

118
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:06,841
Laugh all you want, but she said
she'd like to go out again.

119
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,408
In fact, I'll go call her right now.

120
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:15,144
And I'll make sure and tell her my
friend Chandler says...

121
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,752
Sorry I didn't stop by last
night, but I had a date.

122
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:28,195
When it's 1:00 in the morning and you
don't come by, that's okay.

123
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:33,302
It was with this really hot girl
who moved in across the street.

124
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,303
-Right across the street?
-Yeah.

125
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,841
-When did you meet her?
-Two days ago.

126
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,638
Excellent!

127
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,208
You know, Ross met somebody too.

128
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:46,782
-Hey.
-How'd it go?

129
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,146
We're going out again Saturday.

130
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:54,156
But I found out she's
also seeing some other guy.

131
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,887
Really?

132
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:03,294
Joe, what would you do
if you were in Ross' situation?

133
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:07,802
I am. I'm dating this girl
who's also seeing another guy.

134
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,167
But I'm not worried about it.

135
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:15,643
You shouldn't be. I wouldn't want
to be the guy who's up against you.

136
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:20,147
I mean, that doofus is going to lose.

137
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:25,055
So this is nice.

138
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:30,754
I wish I didn't have to go.
Believe me.

139
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,191
But I have to.

140
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:35,366
So, what's the name
of the girl you're dating?

141
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,160
-Kristen Leigh.
-Bye.

142
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,972
Well, only one of us
can keep dating her.

143
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:53,879
Obviously. So how do we decide?

144
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:57,578
Well, now,
let's look at this objectively.

145
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,121
I think I should date her.

146
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:07,129
Or I'm the one who dates her.

147
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,960
That's interesting.
But check this out. I date her.

148
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,896
Okay, but to go
in another direction..

149
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,507
Okay. This can go on for a while.

150
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,770
-We should order some food then.
-No, Joey.

151
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,909
Look, why don't we
just let her decide, okay?

152
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,950
We'll each go out with her
one more time.

153
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,781
And we'll see who she likes best.

154
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:35,156
That sounds fair.

155
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:39,225
Maybe I'll take her
to that new French restaurant.

156
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,595
Wait a second.
We have to set a spending limit.

157
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,928
I can't take her
to a fancy place like that.

158
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:50,006
Well, sorry.
That's what I do on dates.

159
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:54,804
Well, I guess I'll just have to do
what I do on dates.

160
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,945
-So let's decide on a spending limit.
-Yeah.

161
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,423
And a slice...

162
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,799
six dollars?

163
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:18,532
-I was thinking more like 100.
-Okay.

164
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:21,534
Can I borrow 94 dollars?

165
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:31,911
I know. Can you hand me a tissue?

166
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,124
You're out of Diet Coke.

167
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:46,722
Hello?

168
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,932
What? You what?

169
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,967
You listen here, missy!

170
00:12:56,542 --> 00:13:00,478
Megan booked The Swing Kings
on the day of our wedding...

171
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:04,206
and said she'd only
give them back for the dress!

172
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:07,475
Does that mean Carcass is available?

173
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:13,584
What am I gonna do? That's the dress!
That is "the" dress!

174
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,661
Chandler wants the band.
What do I do?

175
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:21,731
-Figure out how to talk him out of it.
-How?

176
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,094
You're out of toilet paper!

177
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,580
I wanted to wish you good luck
on your date.

178
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:39,044
-Thanks.
-What time are you meeting?

179
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:42,413
We have reservations
at Grand Merci Bistro at 8.

180
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,988
That's in 20 minutes.
You'd better get dressed.

181
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:50,987
-I am dressed.
-Oh, well, good.

182
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,221
For me.

183
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:58,134
What's this?
Did you give yourself a facial?

184
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,930
I have an oily T-zone.

185
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,066
Okay, dude.

186
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,946
-You sent Kristen flowers?
-That's right.

187
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:15,009
You spent 100 dollars.
That's the limit. You're screwed!

188
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:20,053
I sent the flowers before
the actual date, so technically...

189
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,159
I didn't break any rules.

190
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,397
Thanks for stopping by though.

191
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:29,034
That's how it's gonna be?
I can break the rules too.

192
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,760
-What are you gonna do?
-I don't know.

193
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,029
-I'm not surprised.
-You won't get away with this.

194
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,404
-You don't have much choice.
-We'll see!

195
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,310
Hey! So, just a light layer?

196
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,177
Yeah, just here and there.

197
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:56,425
Joey got meat sauce
on the banister again.

198
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,628
Swing music is so out.

199
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:03,290
He's gotta be in the room
for that to work.

200
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,671
What are you guys talking about?

201
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:09,363
We're talking about The Swing Kings...

202
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,338
and whether they're
the right way to go.

203
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:16,014
I went to a wedding
where they had swing music...

204
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,945
two months later
the couple divorced.

205
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:22,518
I'm not saying
there's any connection here...

206
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:26,121
but they did say
that's why they got divorced.

207
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,488
But I love swing music!

208
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,356
But The Swing Kings?

209
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:37,000
They suck so much that people die at
their concerts. They stop living.

210
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:41,102
When Monica and I went to see them,
we had fun.

211
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,035
And there's another reason.

212
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:47,542
-Well, what is the other reason?
-I don't want to say.

213
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:51,341
Well, you have to,
because maybe it's stupid.

214
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:57,217
It's just, while Monica and I
were dancing to them...

215
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:00,652
it was the first time
I knew that...

216
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:05,686
you were the woman that I wanted
to dance all my dances with.

217
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,431
Oh, crap.

218
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:22,146
-Our table will be ready soon.
-Oh, great.

219
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:25,578
-Is your back feeling better?
-That's fine.

220
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:28,582
I guess the more muscles you have...

221
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:32,950
the more they can
spasm out of control.

222
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,159
-Kristen?
-Joey!

223
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:42,424
-What are you doing here?
-I like this place.

224
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:47,401
And technically, I'm not
breaking any rules, so...

225
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:51,872
Well, Ross, this is Joey.
Joey, Ross.

226
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,739
-Hi.
-Hi. It's nice to meet you.

227
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,211
I used to have a friend named Joey.

228
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,751
I don't anymore.

229
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,180
Our table will be ready
in a couple minutes.

230
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:10,488
Sure! I would love
to wait with you guys! Thanks!

231
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,266
So, Joey, you look familiar.

232
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:20,233
Are you on TV or something?

233
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,634
He doesn't like to talk about it...

234
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:26,309
but he's one of the stars
of Days of Our Lives.

235
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:31,342
That's right. Don't you play a woman?

236
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,413
A woman in a man's body.

237
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,749
Much better.

238
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:43,953
It's funny, because you
look familiar to me too.

239
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,720
Have you ever been married?

240
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:49,491
Yes, I have.

241
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:51,998
In fact, just the other day...

242
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:56,367
Kris and I talked about how
I've been married and have a son.

243
00:17:56,642 --> 00:18:00,669
-Little Eric.
-That's right. Wait. No, Ben.

244
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:06,512
So you've just been married
the one time then?

245
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:12,655
-Well...
-You've been married twice?

246
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:16,624
Yes. And...

247
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,525
another time after that.

248
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,559
Boy, I'm getting hungry.

249
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:27,897
Have you ever been so hungry
on a date...

250
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:32,576
that when the girl goes to the
bathroom, you eat her food?

251
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:38,312
You said the waiter ate my crab cake.

252
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:45,288
So, Ross, now why did
that first marriage break up?

253
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:50,554
Was it because the woman was straight
or because she was a lesbian?

254
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:55,295
-Do you two know each other?
-No.

255
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:58,334
But he seems like
a guy who'd marry a woman...

256
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:03,065
on the verge of being a lesbian
and then push her over the edge.

257
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:10,607
Wait a minute!
Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?

258
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:17,014
Have you ever slept
in the same bed with a monkey?

259
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,121
You leave Marcel out of this!

260
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:23,954
Fine! You ever gotten stuck
in a pair of leather pants?

261
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:28,825
Have you ever locked yourself
in a TV cabinet, VD-boy?

262
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:31,264
Monkey-lover!

263
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,477
Where do you think we lost her?

264
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,474
Probably around gonorrhea.

265
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:55,456
-Hi, honey, I'm home!
-Don't come in here!

266
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:59,561
Why, do you have another
boyfriend in there?

267
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:02,757
No. We only mess around at his place.

268
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:08,596
I started it, but now it's scaring me,
so could you come out here?

269
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,569
I'm wearing a wedding dress.

270
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,471
You got a wedding dress?

271
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:16,307
-Yeah, but I'm not keeping it.
-Then why can't I see it?

272
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,413
Oh. I guess you can.

273
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,778
But I have to return it,
so you can't like it.

274
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:25,184
Okay, I promise. I'll hate it.

275
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:35,096
Wow. You look hideous.

276
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:36,829
Really?

277
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:41,972
Yeah. That's like the most
ugliest dress I've ever seen.

278
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,199
Why do you have to return it?

279
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,412
Because it doesn't really fit.

280
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,671
Oh, I booked The Swing Kings.

281
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,816
Oh, that's great. Thanks.

282
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,714
But that dress is terrible.

283
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:59,481
-It makes me want to rip it off you.
-Okay.

284
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,420
But you can't rip it.

285
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,457
Well, maybe a little.

286
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:16,864
Guys, you want to look
at the song list for the wedding?

287
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:18,502
Guys?

288
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,871
I thought you'd be gone all day.

289
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,775
All right, what's going on?

290
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:36,087
I'm sorry. I should probably
leave you girls alone.

291
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:41,926
Laugh all you want, but in 10 minutes
we'll have younger-looking skin.

292
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,569
You know, she could use a little...

293
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,939
Oh, nice shot! Yeah!

1
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:05,067
The reason I asked you to brunch...

2
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:08,468
is because I've been thinking
about my maid of honor.

3
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,733
Oh, my God. This is it. Oh.

4
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:12,771
I hope it's you.

5
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:14,879
-I hope it's you.
-Me too.

6
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:18,880
First of all,
I love you both so much.

7
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:22,816
-You're both so important to me.
-Blah, blah, blah. Who is it?

8
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,718
I was thinking we could
come up with a system...

9
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:29,121
where we trade off
being maid of honor.

10
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:32,594
-Hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine..
-Yes! Oh.

11
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:35,698
Hypothetically.

12
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:36,994
Still.

13
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:42,431
If Phoebe were mine, Rachel would
be Phoebe's, I'd be Rachel's.

14
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:45,202
We all get to do it
and no one gets upset.

15
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:49,741
-That's a pretty good idea.
-I'll do that. So, who's yours?

16
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,647
Well, that's the best part.
You guys get to decide.

17
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:59,824
-Why is that the best part?
-I don't have to.

18
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:06,254
Of course we'll help you decide.
We'll do anything we can to help you.

19
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:07,989
I'd like to make a toast.

20
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:11,303
To the future Mrs. Chandler Bing...

21
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:16,234
my best friend and truly one
of the nicest people that..

22
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:18,337
-Really not deciding.
-Fine.

23
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,876
Excuse me,
I couldn't help overhearing.

24
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,516
-You're marrying Chandler Bing?
-Yeah.

25
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,146
Good luck!

26
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,281
Oh, and good luck to you too!

27
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,659
What a nice lady.

28
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,389
The One With Nap Partners

29
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,735
Yeah!

30
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:21,336
-Die Hard, still great.
-Yep.

31
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,772
Let's make it a double feature?

32
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,239
What else you rent?

33
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,803
Die Hard 2.

34
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,749
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.

35
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:36,213
Well, we'll watch it a second time
and it's Die Hard 2.

36
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:40,019
-Joey, we just saw it.
-And?

37
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,285
It would be cool to see it again!

38
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:45,327
-Yeah! Die Hard!
-Die Hard!

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,991
Dude, you didn't say Die Hard.

40
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,494
Is everything okay?

41
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,436
Yeah, I just got plans.

42
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:57,970
Well, John McClane had plans.

43
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:01,938
I want to leave before
Joey gets all worked up...

44
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,514
and starts calling
everybody "bitch."

45
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,648
What are you talking about, bitch?

46
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,249
-Hey, Rachel.
-Yeah?

47
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:16,986
When I get married,
will you be my maid of honor?

48
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,630
Really?

49
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:22,158
Oh, my God, Phoebe.
I mean I'm just..

50
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:23,835
Wait a minute.

51
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:30,765
If I'm your maid of honor,
that means that you are Monica's.

52
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,376
Oh.

53
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:35,904
Well, if that's what you want.

54
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,778
No way, Phoebe.
I want to be Monica's.

55
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:43,285
-Why does it even matter?
-Why does it matter to you?

56
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,686
Because this one is now.

57
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,760
And it's two of our best friends.

58
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,463
And who knows what you're gonna marry.

59
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,699
What if I marry Ross? or Joey?

60
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,538
You wouldn't.

61
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:05,501
Okay, look, Rachel.
I know you really want to do this...

62
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:09,045
but I've never been
maid of honor to anyone before.

63
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,408
I know you've done it at least twice.

64
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,484
-Yeah, but Phoebe..
-Please let me finish.

65
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,816
I guess that was it.

66
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:20,920
Okay.

67
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:25,387
Since you've never done it before,
you can be Monica's maid of honor.

68
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,656
Oh, thank you so much!

69
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,597
Yay.

70
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,399
I'm gonna marry someone good.

71
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,367
Oh, I know.

72
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,134
Better than Chandler.

73
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,092
-What happened?
-I don't know.

74
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,168
We fell asleep. That is all.

75
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,862
Yeah. Yeah? Yeah.

76
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,543
All right, well, I'd better go.

77
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,712
-I think that would be best.
-Yeah.

78
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,608
-I'll talk to you later.
-Okay.

79
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,216
-But not about this.
-No, never. Never!

80
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,985
-Bye.
-No touch. No touch.

81
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,153
Hey, a weird thing happened at brunch.

82
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,889
This woman overheard that
I was marrying you...

83
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,998
and she wished me good luck.

84
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,426
That's sweet.

85
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,571
No, it was more like a "good luck."

86
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,203
So, what did this woman look like?

87
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,708
She was, like, 30,
dark hair, attractive.

88
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:51,350
Any chance you were looking into a
bright, shiny thing called a mirror?

89
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:54,178
Was it someone you dated in college?

90
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,685
No, I only dated two girls
in college...

91
00:05:56,923 --> 00:06:00,290
both blond, both not attractive.

92
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,851
Let me check this out.

93
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,724
-What are you doing?
-Well, let's see.

94
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,763
Okay, is that her?

95
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,367
Oh, my God, yes!

96
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:14,266
-Who is she?
-Julie Graff, my camp girlfriend.

97
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,105
Did you break up with her?

98
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,903
No, we're still together.

99
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,416
We went out for two summers
and then I broke up with her.

100
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,781
-Why?
-She came back the third summer...

101
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:33,618
and she'd gotten really fa..

102
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:39,124
-Fat?
-I did not say fat.

103
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,993
I said fa..

104
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:46,071
You broke up with a girl
because she was fat?

105
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,069
Yeah. Yeah.

106
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:52,573
But it was a really long time ago.
Does she still feel bad?

107
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,110
Apparently she does.

108
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:57,248
You know what they say:
"Elephants never forget."

109
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,921
Seriously, good luck marrying me.

110
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:09,522
Hey, what's going on?

111
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,730
She's Monica's maid of honor.

112
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:16,300
Hope it goes better than the last time
you did it for that girl downstairs.

113
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:21,166
You have been maid of honor before?

114
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:25,140
You see? This is exactly why
you shouldn't lie.

115
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,037
That's it. I am maid of honor.

116
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,374
-No, I am.
-How come you are?

117
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,278
Because I cared enough to lie.

118
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,315
Hey, I could help you decide
who should do it.

119
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:37,989
We could have an audition.

120
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:41,317
See how you'd handle
maid-of-honor-type situations.

121
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,757
-What do you mean?
-When I want a job...

122
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:47,022
I audition and if I'm the best
of the people they see...

123
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,189
I get the part.

124
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,336
So, okay, so after this audition,
who decides who gets it?

125
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,767
Oh, me and Ross can be the judges.

126
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,870
-It's better than us deciding.
-Oh, this is crazy.

127
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,704
-Can't we just flip a coin?
-No, coins hate me.

128
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:05,515
Okay, fine. You know what?
We will let Ross and Joey decide.

129
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,681
Hi!

130
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,150
Ross, sweetie.

131
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:15,292
Hey there, handsome thing.

132
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:23,234
Wow, this cologne really is
every bit as good as Giorgio.

133
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:30,735
Hey.

134
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,036
Just brought back your videos.

135
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:38,183
Hey, Ross. Look, I think
we need to talk about before.

136
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,352
No. No, we don't.

137
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:41,775
Yes, we do.

138
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,554
Now, look.
That was the best nap I ever had.

139
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,059
I don't know what
you're talking about.

140
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,265
Come on, admit it.

141
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,561
That was the best nap you ever had.

142
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,365
I've had better.

143
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,905
Okay. When?

144
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:08,580
All right! All right!
It was the best nap ever!

145
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,280
I said it, okay?

146
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,451
But it's over, Joey!

147
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,044
I want to do it again.

148
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,093
We can't do it again.

149
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,763
-Why not?
-Because it's weird!

150
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,664
Fine.

151
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,059
You want a drink?

152
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:33,796
-Sure. What do you got?
-Warm milk and Excedrin PM.

153
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,404
Chandler.

154
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,580
I just figured out who you are.

155
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,049
Can you figure out what I'm doing?

156
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:53,084
-You're Louis Posen.
-Who?

157
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:56,551
He was my best friend in fifth grade.

158
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:00,129
One day, I asked him to be
my boyfriend and he said no.

159
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,559
Do you know why?

160
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:06,033
Because you kept talking to him while
he was trying to go to the bathroom?

161
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,770
No, but because he thought
I was too fa..

162
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:15,244
Every time I think about it,
I feel as bad as I did then.

163
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,042
I really think you should
apologize to Julie.

164
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,378
Honey, are you kidding?
That was like 16 years ago.

165
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:25,387
It would make me feel better
if Louis apologized to me.

166
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:29,152
I'll do it. But I warn you,
this may make me a better person.

167
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,091
And that is not the man
you fell in love with.

168
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:38,169
Okay, we'll give you hypothetical
maid-of-honor situations.

169
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,805
You'll be scored
on a scale of one to ten.

170
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,441
-One being the highest.
-Ten is the highest.

171
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,942
-Why is 10 the highest?
-Because it's the highest.

172
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,147
Okay, Rachel, you're up first.

173
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:55,081
Situation number one:
You're with Monica.

174
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:59,485
The wedding is about to start
when Monica gets cold feet. Go!

175
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,955
I don't want to marry Chandler.

176
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,389
-I've got cold feet.
-It's gonna be okay.

177
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:07,031
One man the rest of my life?
I don't know.

178
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,758
This means I'll never
get to sleep with Joey.

179
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,263
Look, Monica...

180
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,599
getting cold feet is very common.

181
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,242
It's just because
of all the anticipation.

182
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:23,608
And you just have to remember
that you love Chandler.

183
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,374
And also, I ran out on a wedding.

184
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,053
You don't get to keep the gifts.

185
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,183
Drawing on your own experience.

186
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,619
Very good.

187
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,191
Yes, very nice, Rachel.

188
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,623
Thank you, judges.

189
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,888
-Kiss ass.
-Oh.

190
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,068
-Okay, Phoebe.
-Yes, Your Honor.

191
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,868
We're now in the ceremony.

192
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,098
Monica is about to say, "I do"...

193
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,707
when her drunk uncle
starts yelling.

194
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,275
What do you do? Go!

195
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,106
When Monica was a little girl...

196
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,249
I remember that..

197
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,554
Ow!

198
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,221
-Very good!
-Oh.

199
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,822
Yes, excellent. Perfect score.

200
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:10,460
She just made a scene
in the middle of the ceremony!

201
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,460
Hey, you want
a little taste of Phoebe?

202
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,930
It is time for you to give
your maid-of-honor speech.

203
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,628
We haven't even prepared..

204
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,172
-Go!
-Okay, okay, okay.

205
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,843
Webster's Dictionary
defines marriage as..

206
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,539
Okay, no! Forget that! That sucks!
Okay, never mind. Forget it.

207
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:36,744
I met.. I met Monica when we were
just a couple of 6-year-olds...

208
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:41,859
and became friends with Chandler
when he was 25...

209
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,460
although he seemed
like a 6-year-old.

210
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,689
Oh.

211
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,663
Thank you. Thank you very much.

212
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,300
I've known them
separately and together.

213
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:59,670
To know them as a couple is to know
that you are in the presence of love.

214
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:03,210
So I would like to raise my glass...

215
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,110
to Monica and Chandler...

216
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:09,811
and the beautiful adventure they
are about to embark upon together.

217
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:13,684
I can think of no two people
better prepared for the journey.

218
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,127
Wow.

219
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,693
-Great speech.
-Yeah, it really was.

220
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:20,923
Oh, thanks.

221
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,037
Okay, Phoebe, I guess you're next.
Although I really don't see the point.

222
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:30,634
Okay.

223
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,270
I can't believe that Monica
and Chandler are getting married.

224
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,075
I remember talking
about this day with Rachel...

225
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:42,118
while we were
showering together, naked.

226
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,719
And she's back in the game!

227
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,564
Julie. Hi.

228
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,039
Chandler Bing.
I guess you remember me.

229
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,335
Hello, Skidmark.

230
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,581
It's a nickname. I'll explain later.

231
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,643
It's pretty clear.

232
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:20,952
I owe you a long, overdue apology.

233
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,618
I shouldn't have broken up with you
because of your weight.

234
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,364
That's why you broke up with me?

235
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,804
You didn't know that?

236
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,105
Well, I guess my work here is done.

237
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:46,682
First of all, I would like to say
you both performed very well, okay?

238
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:48,476
You should be proud.

239
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:53,488
And I'd also like to say, in this
competition, there are no losers.

240
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,024
Well, except Rachel. Damn it!

241
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,222
Really? I won.

242
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:02,400
-What?
-I'm sorry, Rach, it was really close.

243
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:06,332
-Well, then I demand a recount!
-Actually, it wasn't that close.

244
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:09,632
You know what?
Your thing was so stupid anyway.

245
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,105
We're gonna flip a coin, all right?

246
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,907
Heads.

247
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,475
What? The coins have
finally forgiven me!

248
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:23,310
Know what? I hope Monica
forgives you after you throw her...

249
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:28,618
vegetarian-voodoo-goddess-circle-y
shower.

250
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:33,631
Rach, it's gonna be okay.
You guys are the best!

251
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,666
Boy, I tell you. That judging stuff
took a lot out of me.

252
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,032
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

253
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,506
Thinking about maybe going upstairs
and taking a little nap on my couch.

254
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:51,148
Why would I care about that?

255
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,511
No reason. I'm just saying that...

256
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,012
that's where I'll be.

257
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:21,674
As bad as that went,
I actually enjoyed myself.

258
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,214
I think that I'm going to apologize
for all the stupid things that I do.

259
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,977
Why don't you just stop
doing stupid things?

260
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:33,315
-Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
-I'd love it if I could do both.

261
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,287
All right, I have to ask.

262
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:40,789
What?

263
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,399
Will you break up with me
if I get fat?

264
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:45,763
What?

265
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:49,270
You broke up with Julie.
How much weight did she gain?

266
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,807
A hundred and forty-five pounds.

267
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,507
In one year?

268
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,975
My God, what did she eat?
Her family?

269
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,112
That's not the point.

270
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,279
I know it was a stupid reason to
break up with someone, but I was 15.

271
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:09,723
Yeah, well, that's not
the only time this was an issue.

272
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,222
You remember when you spent
Thanksgiving with us?

273
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:15,525
You called me fat.

274
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:16,927
Wait a minute.

275
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,764
-That was totally different.
-How?

276
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:23,772
You were not supposed to hear that.
I said that behind your back.

277
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:28,542
What if I have babies, okay?
I'm gonna look different.

278
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,306
I'm okay with that,
but I'm not sure you are.

279
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:35,476
You have to realize I don't think
of you as a thin, beautiful woman.

280
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:43,016
This is one of the things that
I can apologize for later.

281
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,129
What I mean is, you're Monica.

282
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:50,392
Okay? And I am in love with Monica.

283
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,261
Keep going.

284
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:56,498
So you can balloon up
or you can shrink down...

285
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,709
and I will still love you.

286
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:03,543
Even if I were to shrink down
to 2 inches tall?

287
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,575
I'd carry you around in my pocket.

288
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,145
I love you.

289
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:15,417
Skidmark still got a way
with the ladies.

290
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,488
Hi, Phoebe.

291
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,097
-Hi.
-Hi.

292
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:22,993
I just want to apologize.

293
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,601
I'm really sorry I was a baby.

294
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:29,365
That's ridiculous.
Rachel, we were all babies once.

295
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,103
Oh, you mean today. Yeah.

296
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,572
Yeah, and you know,
you deserve to win.

297
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,680
And I was thinking about it.

298
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,047
If you're Monica's maid of honor,
I get to be yours.

299
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,349
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

300
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,023
When Monica and Chandler got engaged,
I put some stuff together.

301
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,132
-Just in case.
-Oh, that's so sweet. Thanks.

302
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:58,632
Here is a book of poetry
that I know Monica loves.

303
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,065
Oh, God, this is funny. Look.

304
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:05,073
Here's a picture from one Halloween
when she dressed up as a bride.

305
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:06,904
She made me carry her train...

306
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:10,240
which was weird
because I was Wonder Woman.

307
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,644
Oh, and here's
a little purse that I found.

308
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,720
I just thought they could hold
the rings in there.

309
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,585
-Oh.
-Something. And...

310
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:25,354
vintage handkerchiefs, you know,
because people cry at weddings.

311
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,997
I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.

312
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,498
This stuff is great.

313
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:34,069
I forgot this was in here.

314
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:40,135
This was the garter
that I was saving for my wedding.

315
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:44,075
And I wanted it
to be Monica's "something borrowed."

316
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,080
And it's blue.

317
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,516
Rach, I think that you should be
Monica's maid of honor.

318
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,086
You do?

319
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:03,261
-Why?
-Because I think it means more to you.

320
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,433
But, Phoebe, honey, you earned it.

321
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,765
It's fine.
I mean, this is something...

322
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:12,637
that you've been thinking about
since you were, what, 14?

323
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,970
No, I was 10.
I just developed early.

324
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,773
Man alive!

325
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,484
-Hey, what's going on?
-Hey!

326
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:26,783
We decided Rachel is
going to be your maid of honor.

327
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,521
Oh, that's great!

328
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:33,128
Oh, wow. Okay, we really
have to start planning.

329
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,424
I have really specific ideas.

330
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,692
We should meet four times a week.

331
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:40,803
Come to my place,
we'll get together before work.

332
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:44,737
What do you say, 6:30, my place?
So excited!

333
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,981
Yeah, okay. You laugh now.

334
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,687
She's gonna be yours.

335
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,037
Great nap.

336
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,174
It really was.

337
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,191
What the hell are you doing?

338
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,597
God!

339
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:47,529
Excuse me.

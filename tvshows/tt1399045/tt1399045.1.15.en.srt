1
00:00:18,388 --> 00:00:20,278
Vanessa...

2
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:21,419
why didn't you tell me?

3
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,320
I'm telling you now.

4
00:00:23,322 --> 00:00:26,210
- When did you find out?
- Yesterday.

5
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:28,459
- Yesterday?
- Yeah, at band practice.

6
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:31,165
We've texted, like,
500 times since then.

7
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,497
I know, but I wanted to
see the look on your face.

8
00:00:35,522 --> 00:00:38,035
A full scholarship?

9
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:40,070
Your parents must be freaking.

10
00:00:40,095 --> 00:00:41,568
They're happy.

11
00:00:41,593 --> 00:00:45,810
My mom spazzed a little,
but she always does that.

12
00:00:46,499 --> 00:00:49,536
I'm so proud of you.

13
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:51,649
Thanks.

14
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,351
So much for having
the place to ourselves.

15
00:01:00,946 --> 00:01:02,776
Hey, you mind turning your lights off?

16
00:01:09,828 --> 00:01:12,795
Is that a... mask?

17
00:01:31,457 --> 00:01:35,973

18
00:01:50,921 --> 00:01:52,420
I'm telling you, man,

19
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,719
you are playing with fire here.

20
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:57,351
- Jack, we have...
- _

21
00:01:57,376 --> 00:02:00,358
stared down terrorists,
defused countless bombs,

22
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,127
and even stopped a planet-killing virus,

23
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:04,462
- and you're scared of...
- Robots.

24
00:02:04,464 --> 00:02:06,657
Yeah, and if you were
smart, you would be, too.

25
00:02:06,682 --> 00:02:08,199
Haven't you heard of
the robot apocalypse?

26
00:02:08,201 --> 00:02:10,501
The-the-the robo-pocalypse?

27
00:02:10,526 --> 00:02:12,971
Yeah, in science fiction.

28
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:14,539
This is science fact.

29
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:16,470
If the Phoenix is to
pose as a think tank,

30
00:02:16,495 --> 00:02:19,087
every now and then, we have
to do something think-tanky.

31
00:02:19,112 --> 00:02:22,571
That's cool. Let's work on
space rockets or solar panels,

32
00:02:22,596 --> 00:02:25,640
instead of trying to build
our own Terminator here, man.

33
00:02:25,665 --> 00:02:27,921
- It's not a good idea.
- It's not a Terminator.

34
00:02:27,923 --> 00:02:29,453
Well, it looks like a Terminator.

35
00:02:29,478 --> 00:02:32,497
Come on, Jack, the earliest
applications for A.I.

36
00:02:32,522 --> 00:02:34,528
will most likely be in
the field of patient care.

37
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,129
All right, virtual helpers who'll remind
the elderly to take their medicine.

38
00:02:37,154 --> 00:02:38,278
What's so scary about that?

39
00:02:38,303 --> 00:02:41,698
Well, nothing at first, until
those virtual helper thingies

40
00:02:41,723 --> 00:02:43,911
become sentient, self-aware.

41
00:02:43,966 --> 00:02:46,339
They don't want to listen to
us anymore, and they rise up.

42
00:02:46,364 --> 00:02:48,926
I mean, the next thing you
know, we'll all be in float tanks

43
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:50,818
with those... USB ports

44
00:02:50,843 --> 00:02:53,128
hanging out of the back of
our heads, I'm telling you.

45
00:02:53,153 --> 00:02:55,505
That's The Matrix. You're
mixing up your doomsday theories.

46
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,077
If you know so much about sci-fi, Jack,

47
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,689
then you know about Isaac Asimov

48
00:02:58,714 --> 00:03:01,113
and the three laws of
robotics that keep us all safe.

49
00:03:01,138 --> 00:03:04,707
When it comes to robots,
there's only one man I trust.

50
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,471
Schwarzenegger.

51
00:03:07,496 --> 00:03:09,366
I'm telling you, Arnie
showed us the future,

52
00:03:09,391 --> 00:03:11,158
and it ain't cuddly, boys.

53
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:13,694
It's killer robots.

54
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,906
Whoa!

55
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:16,644
Oh...

56
00:03:18,188 --> 00:03:20,234
He was making a move. You saw him.

57
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:25,047
You sa... you saw him.
He was making a move.

58
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,077
Matty needs us upstairs, now.

59
00:03:28,102 --> 00:03:29,935
You done lost your damn mind, Jack.

60
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:31,694
Yeah, whatever. Ah!

61
00:03:31,695 --> 00:03:33,428
That's why you hurt your hand.

62
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,772
Ah, I hate robots, man.

63
00:03:36,797 --> 00:03:39,334
Last night, Vanessa Frank and Daniel Lee

64
00:03:39,336 --> 00:03:42,570
were found dead in a small
park near San Francisco.

65
00:03:42,595 --> 00:03:45,641
They were having a picnic
when an unidentified man

66
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:47,109
gunned them down.

67
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:49,104
An eyewitness told SFPD that

68
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,550
he thought he saw the
shooter walking away,

69
00:03:51,575 --> 00:03:53,159
but he couldn't make a positive ID.

70
00:03:53,184 --> 00:03:55,785
Excuse me, Matty, maybe
I didn't get the memo.

71
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,932
We're a spy agency.

72
00:03:56,957 --> 00:03:58,923
This sounds like a
straight-up murder case.

73
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:01,423
Why can't the San
Francisco PD handle this?

74
00:04:04,929 --> 00:04:07,729
Ordinarily, they would.

75
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:13,302
But Vanessa Frank was my goddaughter.

76
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,338
Matty, I'm sorry.

77
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,174
The eyewitness was a passing driver

78
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,710
who spotted Vanessa
and Dan from the road.

79
00:04:21,712 --> 00:04:25,607
He told SFPD that he
saw a man in a black hood

80
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,663
walking away from their bodies,

81
00:04:27,773 --> 00:04:29,671
holding a gun.

82
00:04:30,015 --> 00:04:32,421
A young couple in the park
and a black-hooded shooter?

83
00:04:32,423 --> 00:04:34,091
What is it, Boze?

84
00:04:34,231 --> 00:04:36,925
The details just sound familiar.

85
00:04:36,927 --> 00:04:39,630
A lot like something that
happened a long time ago.

86
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:41,430
The details are identical.

87
00:04:41,432 --> 00:04:42,898
Identical to what?

88
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,800
To the murders committed
by the Zodiac Killer.

89
00:04:44,802 --> 00:04:46,034
Zodiac?

90
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,236
Like the serial killer from the '60s?

91
00:04:47,238 --> 00:04:48,364
I thought they caught that guy.

92
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:50,372
No. Actually, he just disappeared.

93
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:51,996
This is a police sketch

94
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:55,077
of the original Zodiac from 1969.

95
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:57,938
Fashion trends come and
go, but creepy is forever.

96
00:04:57,963 --> 00:04:59,304
Well, this has got to be a copycat.

97
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:01,891
His last murder was almost 50 years ago.

98
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,172
He'd be in his 70s by now.

99
00:05:03,197 --> 00:05:04,977
Yeah, but the Zodiac
just shot his victims.

100
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:06,765
As long as the man can still
walk and squeeze a trigger...

101
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,961
All right, so which is it?

102
00:05:07,986 --> 00:05:10,287
We're looking for a
70-year-old serial killer,

103
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:12,561
or some brand-new kind of psycho here?

104
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,945
Either way, I'm on the next
flight to San Francisco,

105
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,193
and I'd like for you
all to come with me.

106
00:05:17,218 --> 00:05:19,390
This isn't an official
Phoenix assignment,

107
00:05:19,415 --> 00:05:21,818
so I can't make you go.

108
00:05:22,373 --> 00:05:24,628
But I'm asking for your help.

109
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:26,174
Of course.

110
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:28,410
- I'm in.
- Me, too.

111
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:33,519
Whatever you need, Matty, you got it.

112
00:05:34,245 --> 00:05:36,179
Then you need to see what we're facing.

113
00:05:36,204 --> 00:05:39,258
SFPD won't release this
video to the public.

114
00:05:39,283 --> 00:05:41,657
They still remember the
panic the Zodiac caused

115
00:05:41,682 --> 00:05:44,047
when he terrorized the city years ago.

116
00:05:44,072 --> 00:05:45,632
This is Officer Janine Alvarez speaking.

117
00:05:45,657 --> 00:05:47,657
The time is 10:48 p.m.

118
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:50,329
I'm first on the scene of
an apparent double homicide.

119
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,296
First victim male, Asian, late teens.

120
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:55,421
Appears to be shot
three times in the chest

121
00:05:55,446 --> 00:05:57,404
and once in the right arm...

122
00:05:57,429 --> 00:05:58,800
signs of a struggle.

123
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:02,700
Second victim female,
Caucasian, late teens.

124
00:06:02,725 --> 00:06:06,544
Shot four times in the back,
right hand is covered in blood.

125
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,900
She's trying to crawl away.

126
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,872
No.

127
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,938
She's trying to identify her killer.

128
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,185
Copycat or not...

129
00:06:17,306 --> 00:06:19,294
we're gonna catch him.

130
00:06:34,597 --> 00:06:37,141
Betty Lou Jensen and
David Arthur Faraday

131
00:06:37,165 --> 00:06:39,203
were his first victims.

132
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:41,309
David was the first boy Betty's parents

133
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,366
ever let take her out.

134
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:46,649
One moment you're on your first date,

135
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:47,853
but the next...

136
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,441
David was shot once in the head,

137
00:06:54,466 --> 00:06:56,663
Betty got five bullets to the back.

138
00:06:56,665 --> 00:06:58,031
Both died instantly.

139
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:00,308
That is really creepy.

140
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,601
Police only proved five murders

141
00:07:01,603 --> 00:07:02,800
were the work of the Zodiac.

142
00:07:02,825 --> 00:07:05,105
But in the letters he sent to
the San Francisco Chronicle,

143
00:07:05,107 --> 00:07:08,075
the Zodiac claimed he killed 37 people.

144
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:11,017
I'll give him this much...

145
00:07:11,048 --> 00:07:12,980
he knew how to dress the part.

146
00:07:12,982 --> 00:07:14,835
The hood, the glasses.

147
00:07:14,837 --> 00:07:16,407
Very creepy.

148
00:07:16,432 --> 00:07:17,517
He was theatrical.

149
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,618
The lead detective on the case

150
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,149
believed he was inspired by movies.

151
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:21,727
One of the first letters he sent

152
00:07:21,752 --> 00:07:24,030
quoted a line from The
Most Dangerous Game,

153
00:07:24,055 --> 00:07:26,760
a 1932 movie about hunting people.

154
00:07:26,762 --> 00:07:28,595
Well, see, that's why
I think he's a copycat.

155
00:07:28,597 --> 00:07:30,030
If he was the real guy,
what about the creepy

156
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,241
handwritten letters with
the cipher at the bottom?

157
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:34,242
That was the most famous
part about the Zodiac.

158
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:36,336
Yeah, but back in '68,
the letters didn't show up

159
00:07:36,338 --> 00:07:38,605
until months after the first murders.

160
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:41,778
Good thing we're not in '68 anymore.

161
00:07:41,803 --> 00:07:43,288
I'm gonna run a search of the cameras

162
00:07:43,327 --> 00:07:45,184
in the area Vanessa
and Daniel were killed,

163
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:47,538
see if we can get a
video of our copycat.

164
00:07:47,563 --> 00:07:49,116
That's if he's a copycat.

165
00:07:49,118 --> 00:07:50,751
Come on, you really
think a serial killer

166
00:07:50,753 --> 00:07:52,619
who's gotten away with his
crimes for more than 40 years

167
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:54,224
is gonna suddenly start back up again?

168
00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:57,231
A life change could suppress the
urge to kill for a period of time.

169
00:07:57,256 --> 00:07:59,029
Both the BTK and the Grim Sleeper

170
00:07:59,054 --> 00:08:00,777
stopped killing people for years,

171
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:03,574
But then, eventually, the monster
inside of them woke back up.

172
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,896
And maybe you know way too
much about serial killers.

173
00:08:05,921 --> 00:08:08,122
I call it being prepared.

174
00:08:08,147 --> 00:08:09,780
You ever come face to face with one,

175
00:08:09,782 --> 00:08:12,935
your survival hinges on being
able to get inside of their head.

176
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,540
You know, figuring out what drives them,

177
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:18,009
and finding a way to
use it against them.

178
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:19,753
Otherwise,

179
00:08:19,778 --> 00:08:21,980
you'll just end up another
one of their statistics.

180
00:08:21,982 --> 00:08:25,597
Like I said, you know way
too much about serial killers.

181
00:08:25,622 --> 00:08:27,919
That's because I've seen
every serial killer movie

182
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:29,620
and documentary ever made.

183
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,202
Research for a movie I was writing.

184
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:35,569
I swear, look, if this
was a serial killer flick,

185
00:08:35,594 --> 00:08:36,728
I'm not the psycho.

186
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:39,305
I'm the loyal friend who dies first.

187
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:43,369
Oh, no. I'm the loyal
friend who dies first.

188
00:08:43,394 --> 00:08:45,571
Relax. If we do our jobs right,

189
00:08:45,572 --> 00:08:46,908
nobody else gets killed,

190
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:49,267
and we catch this guy
before he strikes again.

191
00:08:51,077 --> 00:08:52,276
Right.

192
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:13,132
Hi. Can you tell me where Sarah is?

193
00:09:13,157 --> 00:09:15,335
Oh, yeah. Right through there.

194
00:09:24,123 --> 00:09:25,589
Give me a moment.

195
00:09:25,614 --> 00:09:27,948
- Yeah, of course.
- Sure.

196
00:09:52,238 --> 00:09:54,639
Jack, MacGyver.

197
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:01,679
Sarah, these are the men
that I was telling you about,

198
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:04,148
Angus MacGyver and Jack Dalton.

199
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,057
They're a part of my team.

200
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,053
We're so sorry.

201
00:10:09,813 --> 00:10:11,479
Ma'am, there's, uh...

202
00:10:12,056 --> 00:10:14,297
there's no good way to ask the questions

203
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,531
that need to be asked here.

204
00:10:15,556 --> 00:10:17,080
Please...

205
00:10:18,064 --> 00:10:20,298
I want to help in any way I can.

206
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,532
Okay.

207
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:24,068
Do you know if Vanessa caught the eye

208
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,803
of someone new recently?

209
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:27,134
No.

210
00:10:27,941 --> 00:10:29,883
She and Daniel,

211
00:10:29,908 --> 00:10:31,736
they were very happy.

212
00:10:31,947 --> 00:10:34,055
- Was she having trouble with anybody?
- No.

213
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,314
Nobody was following her, stalking her,

214
00:10:36,316 --> 00:10:37,815
- anything like that?
- No. No.

215
00:10:37,817 --> 00:10:39,450
And she didn't mention a...

216
00:10:39,452 --> 00:10:40,764
an old boyfriend,

217
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:42,954
- somebody she met on the Internet?
- No.

218
00:10:43,053 --> 00:10:45,756
If someone was bothering
her, she would've told me.

219
00:10:45,758 --> 00:10:48,576
She always told me everything.

220
00:10:50,263 --> 00:10:53,664
We were so close.

221
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:57,768
Sarah. We're gonna find
the person who did this.

222
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,037
I swear it.

223
00:11:11,324 --> 00:11:14,537
Man, I have known Matty a long time,

224
00:11:14,562 --> 00:11:17,678
and I've never seen her like this.

225
00:11:17,703 --> 00:11:20,068
And I'll be honest with you,
what happened between us,

226
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:21,640
in Chechnya,

227
00:11:21,665 --> 00:11:25,166
that was all my fault.
I really let her down.

228
00:11:27,099 --> 00:11:28,966
I don't know, I kind of...

229
00:11:29,265 --> 00:11:31,745
don't want to let her down
again, you know what I mean?

230
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,939
Yeah. What happened between
you two is in the past, Jack.

231
00:11:34,941 --> 00:11:39,507
Right now, we just need to
focus on... finding this.

232
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,312
What do you see?

233
00:11:41,314 --> 00:11:43,281
It's not about what I see,
it's about what I don't see.

234
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:44,985
You see it?

235
00:11:45,418 --> 00:11:48,419
Hell yeah, I see it.
Someone cut that branch

236
00:11:48,421 --> 00:11:52,096
so they can have a clear line of
sight into Vanessa's room here.

237
00:11:52,121 --> 00:11:53,457
Yep.

238
00:12:39,654 --> 00:12:41,246
This is it.

239
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:44,862
Yeah?

240
00:12:45,012 --> 00:12:47,212
Yeah, take a look.

241
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:55,182
Oh, yeah.

242
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:57,655
Direct view from this spot
right into Vanessa's window.

243
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,013
Look at that.

244
00:12:59,354 --> 00:13:00,782
Definitely his perch.

245
00:13:00,807 --> 00:13:03,259
Hmm. Taking his time here, too.

246
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:05,062
There's got to be, like,
four packs of smokes in there.

247
00:13:05,087 --> 00:13:06,469
Hey, yeah.

248
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,297
Well, he's methodical.

249
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:10,568
He picks his victims in advance,

250
00:13:10,914 --> 00:13:13,337
waits, watches,

251
00:13:13,606 --> 00:13:15,606
carefully plans his attack.

252
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,315
Did you clear the room?

253
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,990
Well, you told me to come to the window.

254
00:13:22,015 --> 00:13:24,749
Next time, clear the room before
blindly following my orders.

255
00:13:24,751 --> 00:13:25,922
Shut up.

256
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,062
Hey!

257
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:15,035
Whoa!

258
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,570
That looked painful, man. You all right?

259
00:14:19,572 --> 00:14:22,540
Yeah. Not my, uh, best landing.

260
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:24,660
What were you doing in that apartment?

261
00:14:24,811 --> 00:14:26,777
Yeah, what's up, man? Huh?

262
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:28,845
How you doing?

263
00:14:28,871 --> 00:14:30,081
Huh?

264
00:14:30,518 --> 00:14:31,929
Start talking.

265
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,389
Don't hurt me. I live
here, man. I live here.

266
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:37,143
In this building. I-It's
warm, and nobody bothers me.

267
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,467
Nobody bothers you, huh? While
you're up there being a weirdo,

268
00:14:39,492 --> 00:14:41,425
chain-smoking, stalking co-eds?

269
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,430
- What are you talking about?
- We know you killed the girl

270
00:14:43,432 --> 00:14:45,127
you've been watching, man.

271
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:46,737
- Kill?
- You know what? I don't even need this.

272
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:48,183
- I'm just gonna beat the bricks off...
- No! No, no, no.

273
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,500
I didn't kill anybody, man.

274
00:14:49,502 --> 00:14:50,901
I'm not even stalking no one.

275
00:14:50,903 --> 00:14:52,536
It's my first time in that unit.

276
00:14:52,538 --> 00:14:55,139
Look, I normally stay in the
back stairwell, b-but the guy...

277
00:14:55,141 --> 00:14:56,307
- Guy? What guy?
- he... yeah.

278
00:14:56,309 --> 00:14:57,541
What guy? What's he look like?

279
00:14:57,543 --> 00:14:59,043
- I don't know, man. Huh?
- What does he look like?

280
00:14:59,045 --> 00:15:00,656
Normal! I don't know!

281
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:03,430
He's not homeless! You know?

282
00:15:03,455 --> 00:15:05,805
We call him the smoking man.

283
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,352
The dude's old, though. Tell
you that. But like scary old.

284
00:15:08,377 --> 00:15:10,110
- That's good. How old?
- Scary old.

285
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:11,981
Yeah, you know know how,
like, Clint Eastwood is like,

286
00:15:12,006 --> 00:15:13,023
he looks like he'd kick your ass?

287
00:15:13,025 --> 00:15:14,725
Yeah, yeah, I get it. How old?

288
00:15:14,727 --> 00:15:15,793
I don't know, man.

289
00:15:15,795 --> 00:15:17,328
- Late 60s?
- Okay.

290
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,355
- 70s?
- What else?

291
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:22,838
He's got gray hair, yeah. Um...

292
00:15:22,863 --> 00:15:24,463
Glasses.

293
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:26,886
Dude walks around with,
like, this big lumbering walk.

294
00:15:26,888 --> 00:15:29,217
Bozer said the Zodiac
walked just like that.

295
00:15:29,242 --> 00:15:30,408
The Zodia... who?

296
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,809
Yeah, do me a favor: stop talking,

297
00:15:31,811 --> 00:15:33,511
unless it's about the
guy that you saw. Okay?

298
00:15:33,513 --> 00:15:34,678
Yeah.

299
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,406
Glasses, lumbering walk.

300
00:15:37,594 --> 00:15:39,405
And he is the right age.

301
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,785
You thinking what I'm thinking?

302
00:15:40,787 --> 00:15:42,438
If this is true,

303
00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:45,256
we might solve one of the
greatest crime stories of all time.

304
00:15:45,258 --> 00:15:48,038
Hell of a way to go down
in the history books.

305
00:15:58,422 --> 00:15:59,955
Let's go.

306
00:15:59,957 --> 00:16:02,524
Well? Get anything new out of him?

307
00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:05,695
No. He just repeated the
same story he told you.

308
00:16:05,697 --> 00:16:08,698
A big, gray-haired, white
guy came here repeatedly

309
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,150
for the last six weeks
to smoke cigarettes

310
00:16:11,175 --> 00:16:13,135
and look out that window, but...

311
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,838
unfortunately, it's not enough
to help us catch Vanessa's killer.

312
00:16:15,863 --> 00:16:18,374
Well, the building was
full of homeless people.

313
00:16:18,376 --> 00:16:20,632
You never know. Maybe one of
them got a good look at him.

314
00:16:20,657 --> 00:16:23,603
What's Encyclopedia Brown up to?

315
00:16:24,228 --> 00:16:27,117
Well, I never really know.
It's part of his charm, I guess.

316
00:16:28,386 --> 00:16:30,720
Is SFPD's forensics team here?

317
00:16:30,722 --> 00:16:32,088
I think I found something.

318
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,957
No. It's gonna be another half and hour.

319
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,926
So you're just gonna have
to wait to borrow their toys.

320
00:16:36,928 --> 00:16:40,029
Or I could just make my own
Electrostatic Dust Print Lifter.

321
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,463
What are you laughing at, Dalton?

322
00:16:43,488 --> 00:16:44,553
Well, I don't know.

323
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:46,330
You have no idea what he's doing either.

324
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,147
Okay, since it looks like you're
just playing with the trash,

325
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:05,787
you mind telling us exactly
what it is you're doing?

326
00:17:05,812 --> 00:17:08,424
- Yeah, just one sec.
- Nuh-uh.

327
00:17:08,426 --> 00:17:11,123
- That doesn't work for me.
- What'd I do?

328
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:15,447
You already know how I
feel about you improvising.

329
00:17:15,472 --> 00:17:17,322
And right now, all I see

330
00:17:17,348 --> 00:17:20,236
is you possibly destroying
valuable evidence.

331
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,729
Okay. Um...

332
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:29,055
Every step we take leaves
a little bit of dust behind

333
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,503
from all the places we've been before.

334
00:17:31,783 --> 00:17:33,583
It's hard to see on a dirty floor,

335
00:17:33,608 --> 00:17:35,892
but with a little bit of Mylar

336
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:38,120
and a static charge...

337
00:17:52,173 --> 00:17:54,557
You can see the killer's footprint.

338
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,822
Ha. See, I told you.

339
00:17:56,847 --> 00:17:58,447
The boy's a magician.

340
00:17:58,472 --> 00:17:59,891
Hey, Riley. It's Jack.

341
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,860
I'm sending you a
picture of a boot print.

342
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:04,765
We need to know everything you
can tell us about it, all right?

343
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,989
Yep. On it.

344
00:18:05,991 --> 00:18:08,383
Did you get anything from
the cameras around the park?

345
00:18:08,408 --> 00:18:10,930
No. The killer must've
cased the area beforehand.

346
00:18:10,946 --> 00:18:12,946
He clearly knew how to
avoid being recorded.

347
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:15,404
But since the Zodiac mostly
killed couples in parks,

348
00:18:15,406 --> 00:18:16,872
we're also monitoring surveillance cams

349
00:18:16,874 --> 00:18:19,375
from romantic spots all over the city.

350
00:18:19,377 --> 00:18:20,887
And there's a lot.

351
00:18:20,912 --> 00:18:23,609
Oh, good. Maybe we can stop
this guy before he strikes again.

352
00:18:23,634 --> 00:18:25,425
How's it coming with
the boot print, Riles?

353
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,692
I can tell you it's size ten and a half,

354
00:18:27,724 --> 00:18:30,145
but finding a match in the
database is gonna take hours.

355
00:18:30,224 --> 00:18:33,317
Actually, I might be
able to beat that time.

356
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,321
You know what?

357
00:18:35,346 --> 00:18:36,846
I knew I've seen that before.

358
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:37,880
Look.

359
00:18:37,882 --> 00:18:39,213
The print you sent matches a boot

360
00:18:39,238 --> 00:18:41,438
used by the U.S. military in the 1960s.

361
00:18:41,586 --> 00:18:43,019
They were called Wing Walkers.

362
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:44,253
And guess who else wore them

363
00:18:44,255 --> 00:18:45,799
besides the U.S. military?

364
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,010
The original Zodiac.

365
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,526
Yep, and he wore size
ten and a half, too.

366
00:18:49,551 --> 00:18:50,831
If the shoe fits...

367
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:54,298
Okay. Let's not start touting
conspiracy theories as fact.

368
00:18:54,323 --> 00:18:56,342
Anybody could've gotten a pair of those.

369
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:57,863
Boots are mass-produced.

370
00:18:57,888 --> 00:18:59,833
Not these. Not anymore.

371
00:18:59,858 --> 00:19:01,956
They stopped making
them over 20 years ago.

372
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,375
Only place you can buy a
pair now is a site like eBay.

373
00:19:04,383 --> 00:19:06,527
- Riley, do you think you can...
- Find a site selling them,

374
00:19:06,552 --> 00:19:08,849
hack in and see if anyone near
here bought a pair recently?

375
00:19:08,874 --> 00:19:10,940
I was doing that before
I started this sentence.

376
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,097
Okay, in the last four months,

377
00:19:13,122 --> 00:19:15,294
11 pairs of Wing Walkers
were bought in the U.S.

378
00:19:15,296 --> 00:19:17,853
And one pair was shipped
to a Russ Collins,

379
00:19:17,878 --> 00:19:19,857
who lives right here in San Francisco.

380
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:22,497
_

381
00:19:24,006 --> 00:19:25,629
_

382
00:19:33,453 --> 00:19:35,246
That's starting to bug me.

383
00:19:35,271 --> 00:19:36,385
What?

384
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,150
You, twisting up those paperclips, man.

385
00:19:38,152 --> 00:19:39,463
It's stupid.

386
00:19:39,488 --> 00:19:41,954
You're stupid. It's relaxing.

387
00:19:45,771 --> 00:19:48,411
Riley. She says she ran
a full background check

388
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,089
on our homeowner, Russ Collins.

389
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,433
No record, clean.

390
00:19:54,435 --> 00:19:57,127
Clean, except for the fact
that he special ordered

391
00:19:57,152 --> 00:19:59,672
the exact same pair of boots
worn by a serial killer.

392
00:19:59,674 --> 00:20:01,574
Which is merely circumstantial.

393
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:04,110
Even if we found the boots,

394
00:20:04,135 --> 00:20:06,877
and I was somehow able to...

395
00:20:06,902 --> 00:20:09,539
match them to the boot
print that I found,

396
00:20:10,263 --> 00:20:12,330
it's not enough to convict him in court.

397
00:20:12,852 --> 00:20:14,253
Okay, what about Collins?

398
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:15,766
How old is he?

399
00:20:18,326 --> 00:20:19,712
Let's see.

400
00:20:19,737 --> 00:20:23,516
Born in 1949.

401
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,331
So he was 20 when the killings started.

402
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,510
Old enough to be the original.

403
00:20:27,868 --> 00:20:30,002
I don't know, man.

404
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,371
I think we're looking pretty solid.

405
00:20:32,396 --> 00:20:34,396
It's the best lead we've got.

406
00:20:34,421 --> 00:20:36,334
Doesn't mean he's the killer.

407
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,081
- Uh, delivery?
- Delivery?

408
00:20:42,912 --> 00:20:44,972
We're in a parked car here, dude.

409
00:20:44,997 --> 00:20:46,919
Back up.

410
00:20:48,155 --> 00:20:49,841
You looking to get shot tonight, huh?

411
00:20:49,866 --> 00:20:51,434
Get around the front of the car.

412
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,058
Move around there.

413
00:20:53,225 --> 00:20:54,994
"To the two men in the Sedan."

414
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:56,321
Who gave you this?

415
00:20:56,346 --> 00:20:58,346
Some guy down the street
offered me a hundred bucks

416
00:20:58,371 --> 00:21:00,073
- to walk this to your car.
- Some guy?

417
00:21:00,098 --> 00:21:01,252
- What he look like?
- Just some guy.

418
00:21:01,254 --> 00:21:03,202
- He had on a hat and sunglasses.
- Sunglasses at night.

419
00:21:03,204 --> 00:21:04,484
You didn't think that
was a little bit weird?

420
00:21:04,509 --> 00:21:05,804
- Hmm?
- I don't know, man.

421
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,339
Could you please just
put the gun away now?

422
00:21:07,341 --> 00:21:09,962
Don't tell me what to do,
boy. Sit your ass down.

423
00:21:13,192 --> 00:21:14,747
If the killer did give
him this, everything

424
00:21:14,772 --> 00:21:17,364
down to the glue used to
seal the envelope is evidence.

425
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:19,442
I'm gonna try and
preserve as much as I can.

426
00:21:32,435 --> 00:21:34,840
"This is the Zodiac speaking

427
00:21:34,842 --> 00:21:37,146
"to the two men in the parked Sedan.

428
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,605
"You may be watching
me, but just know that

429
00:21:39,607 --> 00:21:41,407
"I am watching you.

430
00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:44,410
"Me - 39. You - 0."

431
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,858
All right, I'm gonna
go ahead and say it:

432
00:21:49,883 --> 00:21:51,416
I'm starting to get freaked out here.

433
00:21:51,418 --> 00:21:53,570
Yeah, you're not the only one.

434
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,410
All right, fan out, clear the place.

435
00:22:03,396 --> 00:22:04,963
I don't know what I was expecting,

436
00:22:04,965 --> 00:22:06,631
but it wasn't this.

437
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:16,729
Your name is Ronald Winter.

438
00:22:17,296 --> 00:22:19,135
Normally, in a situation like this,

439
00:22:19,182 --> 00:22:22,347
I'm supposed to give you as
little information as possible

440
00:22:22,372 --> 00:22:24,845
about who I am and what I know.

441
00:22:25,252 --> 00:22:27,057
But I'm gonna tell you something

442
00:22:27,082 --> 00:22:28,953
before we do this little dance,

443
00:22:28,955 --> 00:22:32,240
because maybe it will
inform how you answer me.

444
00:22:34,027 --> 00:22:36,661
Vanessa Frank wasn't just the victim

445
00:22:36,686 --> 00:22:38,880
of a gruesome crime.

446
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:40,899
She was like a daughter to me.

447
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,694
I want you to understand

448
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:47,436
that I just lost someone
I watched grow up.

449
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,574
Someone I loved.

450
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:52,367
I want you to know where
I'm coming from, emotionally,

451
00:22:52,422 --> 00:22:55,757
so that you know the
minute you lie to me,

452
00:22:55,782 --> 00:22:57,422
the minute you hesitate,

453
00:22:57,447 --> 00:22:59,047
the minute you tell me a half-truth,

454
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,618
I'm gonna know,

455
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:04,756
and I'm gonna take that
very, very personally.

456
00:23:10,163 --> 00:23:11,420
Hey.

457
00:23:11,803 --> 00:23:14,265
Had a nice, long chat
with your delivery guy.

458
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,426
Oh, yeah?

459
00:23:15,451 --> 00:23:17,870
Yeah. Story checks out... no priors.

460
00:23:17,895 --> 00:23:20,575
As much as I was hoping
that he was our big break,

461
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,333
I'm thinking the only
thing he's guilty of

462
00:23:22,358 --> 00:23:24,071
is wanting to make a
quick hundred bucks.

463
00:23:24,096 --> 00:23:25,587
Well, did he at least give you

464
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,345
a better description of our suspect?

465
00:23:27,347 --> 00:23:29,103
Mm. Along with the hat and sunglasses,

466
00:23:29,128 --> 00:23:30,883
he was wearing a hoodie.

467
00:23:30,908 --> 00:23:34,364
He was tall, but Ronald
had no idea how old he was.

468
00:23:34,366 --> 00:23:35,499
Well, that helps.

469
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:37,501
Please tell me that you
found something here,

470
00:23:37,526 --> 00:23:39,620
because I am not going back to Sarah

471
00:23:39,645 --> 00:23:41,862
to tell her we have no idea
who murdered her daughter.

472
00:23:41,864 --> 00:23:43,308
Matty, I wish we had more,

473
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:44,435
but we were expecting Seven

474
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,966
and we got Leave it to Beaver.

475
00:23:46,521 --> 00:23:49,947
Okay. Let SFPD handle the house.

476
00:23:49,949 --> 00:23:53,240
Let's regroup and
figure out our next move.

477
00:23:58,424 --> 00:23:59,812
Jack?

478
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,296
You okay, buddy?

479
00:24:04,554 --> 00:24:06,296
You know how you get that
faraway look in your eye

480
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:07,750
when wheels are turning in your head?

481
00:24:07,775 --> 00:24:09,046
No, not really.

482
00:24:09,071 --> 00:24:11,004
Well, you do it all the
time and I'm getting it.

483
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:13,416
You think you're thinking, Jack?

484
00:24:13,939 --> 00:24:16,306
Yeah. Yeah, go with me on this one.

485
00:24:16,308 --> 00:24:18,141
It's gonna sound like
a board game question,

486
00:24:18,143 --> 00:24:20,644
but what is it about a serial killer

487
00:24:20,646 --> 00:24:23,415
that makes 'em so hard to find, huh?

488
00:24:24,274 --> 00:24:26,157
They look perfectly
normal on the outside

489
00:24:26,182 --> 00:24:28,032
because they're trying to cover
up what's going on on the inside.

490
00:24:28,057 --> 00:24:29,227
Exactly.

491
00:24:29,274 --> 00:24:31,221
This place is Leave It To Beaver...

492
00:24:31,223 --> 00:24:33,576
dish towels folded
perfectly on the sink.

493
00:24:33,601 --> 00:24:35,093
The couch... cushions look like

494
00:24:35,118 --> 00:24:36,974
they ain't never even been sat on, man.

495
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:38,437
And look, look.

496
00:24:39,968 --> 00:24:42,432
That's the stock photo
that came with the frame.

497
00:24:42,434 --> 00:24:45,435
- How do you know?
- Well, because I have this one.

498
00:24:45,437 --> 00:24:46,839
It's all too perfect.

499
00:24:46,864 --> 00:24:49,652
Like it's been staged.

500
00:24:49,677 --> 00:24:52,209
Like something horrible may be lying

501
00:24:52,211 --> 00:24:54,411
just beneath the surface.

502
00:24:57,836 --> 00:24:59,134
Exactly.

503
00:25:18,997 --> 00:25:21,552
Wi-Fi signals are just radio waves.

504
00:25:21,577 --> 00:25:23,911
And the cool thing about radio waves

505
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:25,976
is that they can travel through walls.

506
00:25:27,456 --> 00:25:29,493
Now, with...

507
00:25:30,749 --> 00:25:33,564
a dish to focus the waves

508
00:25:34,153 --> 00:25:35,423
and a speaker

509
00:25:35,448 --> 00:25:37,854
to turn the reflections

510
00:25:38,174 --> 00:25:40,737
that bounce back into sound, we can...

511
00:25:40,762 --> 00:25:43,104
You can see through walls.

512
00:25:43,129 --> 00:25:45,041
Yeah. Or hear through them, really.

513
00:25:46,223 --> 00:25:48,567
There's a large open space behind this.

514
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,327
Good eye.

515
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:30,143
Well, I think we found our guy.

516
00:26:31,087 --> 00:26:32,401
Yeah.

517
00:26:34,205 --> 00:26:37,419
1968, '69.

518
00:26:37,881 --> 00:26:41,183
These are the original San
Francisco Chronicle articles

519
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:43,075
on the Zodiac murders.

520
00:26:43,358 --> 00:26:45,952
So either this is a shrine
to the original Zodiac

521
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,607
or this guy is the original.

522
00:26:48,632 --> 00:26:50,389
These photos clearly aren't vintage.

523
00:26:50,414 --> 00:26:51,630
They've been printed off of a computer

524
00:26:51,662 --> 00:26:53,849
and they're recently taken.

525
00:26:54,021 --> 00:26:55,319
Son of a bitch.

526
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,155
He's been scouting his victims.

527
00:26:57,388 --> 00:26:59,157
Like he did with Vanessa.

528
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,459
He's been watching her for weeks.

529
00:27:01,718 --> 00:27:04,289
She's had no idea.

530
00:27:05,098 --> 00:27:07,759
Matty, if, uh, you want
to step outside, maybe...

531
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,628
No. No, the key to catching this bastard

532
00:27:10,653 --> 00:27:13,339
is somewhere in this room
and we're gonna find it.

533
00:27:19,543 --> 00:27:21,944
- Is that a laptop?
- Yeah.

534
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:28,805
Uh, do we need to get
Riley in here on this thing?

535
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,523
No need to. It's not
even password protected

536
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:34,914
I don't think this guy ever
expected anyone to find this place.

537
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:39,074
Okay. Well, it looks like
e-mails. A lot of 'em.

538
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:40,628
What do they say?

539
00:27:40,653 --> 00:27:43,168
I wish I knew.

540
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,567
This is the code the original
Zodiac used, I believe.

541
00:27:46,592 --> 00:27:49,282
According to Bozer, some
of these were deciphered,

542
00:27:49,307 --> 00:27:53,118
but others not even the
NSA or CIA could crack.

543
00:27:53,143 --> 00:27:56,026
Hey, neither organization
had themselves a Riley.

544
00:27:56,051 --> 00:27:57,120
Let's utilize her.

545
00:27:57,145 --> 00:27:59,622
We need to get a disk image
of this laptop to her ASAP.

546
00:27:59,647 --> 00:28:00,652
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

547
00:28:00,654 --> 00:28:02,654
- I'm calling forensics.
- Good.

548
00:28:02,656 --> 00:28:04,536
So our Zodiac...

549
00:28:05,524 --> 00:28:07,824
copies the original down
to the smallest detail...

550
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:10,038
even wears antique boots.

551
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:13,565
But now he's sending him
e-mails over a laptop?

552
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,366
I'm... Am I missing something here?

553
00:28:15,717 --> 00:28:17,802
I think the real question is...

554
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,138
who was he corresponding with?

555
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,040
And why?

556
00:28:24,738 --> 00:28:26,911
- Hey, buddy, what do you got?
- Right now?

557
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,166
A serious case of the heebie-jeebies.

558
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:31,096
Matty had me take the
letter you guys got

559
00:28:31,121 --> 00:28:32,761
from the SFPD evidence room

560
00:28:32,786 --> 00:28:34,886
and compare it to letters
from the original Zodiac.

561
00:28:34,888 --> 00:28:37,689
Officer Reyes hooked me up
with a handwriting expert.

562
00:28:37,691 --> 00:28:39,747
Now, he's still running tests,

563
00:28:39,772 --> 00:28:41,585
but he took one look at your letter

564
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:44,745
and said it's definitely a
match to the original Zodiac.

565
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:49,141
_

566
00:28:56,949 --> 00:28:58,782
Hey man. Uh, Presidio Heights,

567
00:28:58,963 --> 00:29:00,991
corner of Washington and Cherry.

568
00:29:03,717 --> 00:29:05,850
I can't trace the e-mails.

569
00:29:05,852 --> 00:29:08,145
They're single-use
addresses routed through Tor.

570
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:11,022
So I started trying to
crack the cipher, but...

571
00:29:11,047 --> 00:29:12,491
it's no joke.

572
00:29:12,516 --> 00:29:13,893
I think he changed encryption keys

573
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,184
from one letter to the next.

574
00:29:15,209 --> 00:29:17,554
I was able to partially
decode a few of the e-mails,

575
00:29:17,579 --> 00:29:18,827
but the rest are gonna take a while.

576
00:29:18,852 --> 00:29:21,251
What did the e-mails
that you could decode say?

577
00:29:21,276 --> 00:29:23,019
It's correspondence between our Zodiac

578
00:29:23,044 --> 00:29:25,136
and someone who was
actually encouraging him.

579
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,571
Encouraging him? Like...

580
00:29:26,573 --> 00:29:28,673
like what, "Attaboy, go serial kill?"

581
00:29:28,698 --> 00:29:29,907
More like teaching him.

582
00:29:29,909 --> 00:29:32,644
Giving him the step-by-step
on how to be a serial killer.

583
00:29:32,874 --> 00:29:34,979
The original Zodiac
would never need anybody

584
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,247
to teach him how to kill.

585
00:29:36,272 --> 00:29:38,233
This is definitely a copycat.

586
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:40,593
A copycat that someone
else pushed over the edge.

587
00:29:40,618 --> 00:29:43,693
Riley, I need to know who both the
killer and the correspondent are,

588
00:29:43,718 --> 00:29:45,178
and I need to know that now.

589
00:29:45,203 --> 00:29:46,469
Copy that.

590
00:29:46,471 --> 00:29:48,569
Whoever they are, I'll unmask 'em.

591
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,190
Call as soon as you've got something.

592
00:29:50,224 --> 00:29:51,504

00:30:48,926 --> 00:30:51,360
You can run, but you can't hide.

603
00:31:17,527 --> 00:31:19,694
Good, you're awake.

604
00:31:22,629 --> 00:31:24,663
You thought you could track me down.

605
00:31:24,665 --> 00:31:26,842
You thought you could find me.

606
00:31:27,089 --> 00:31:29,560
No one's ever found me.

607
00:31:33,407 --> 00:31:36,241
And now no one's ever gonna find you.

608
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:52,354
Thanks, man.

609
00:32:02,144 --> 00:32:05,212
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

610
00:32:08,068 --> 00:32:10,135
Riley!

611
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,926
Riley!

612
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:20,028
_

613
00:32:20,075 --> 00:32:21,895
_

614
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,348
_

615
00:32:27,131 --> 00:32:28,942
"To Those Who Seek Me."

616
00:32:30,373 --> 00:32:32,077
"I know you found my special room,

617
00:32:32,102 --> 00:32:35,002
"and I'm sure right now you
think you're smarter than me,

618
00:32:35,004 --> 00:32:37,530
"but you pigs have never been smarter.

619
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:41,308
"Here's my ultimatum:
stop coming after me,

620
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:44,278
"and in 24 hours I'll
release the little angel.

621
00:32:44,481 --> 00:32:47,681
"But if you follow
me, if you look for me,

622
00:32:47,683 --> 00:32:50,692
"if you hunt for me,
she'll join the others.

623
00:32:50,953 --> 00:32:53,361
"Me... 40?

624
00:32:53,386 --> 00:32:54,818
"You... zero."

625
00:32:54,843 --> 00:32:57,005
40 question mark... what the
hell's that supposed to mean?

626
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,500
He's saying if we don't
stop looking for him,

627
00:32:58,525 --> 00:32:59,960
Riley will be his 40th victim.

628
00:32:59,985 --> 00:33:02,426
Eh, he's lying. He's not
just gonna let her go.

629
00:33:02,428 --> 00:33:03,483
If we want to get Riley back,

630
00:33:03,508 --> 00:33:04,810
we're gonna have to do that ourselves.

631
00:33:04,835 --> 00:33:06,756
I agree. He's just trying to stall.

632
00:33:06,795 --> 00:33:08,561
Changing his behavior
because he knows we're close.

633
00:33:08,563 --> 00:33:10,060
So how do we get even closer?

634
00:33:10,085 --> 00:33:11,933
Riley was decoding his e-mail...

635
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:14,324
it's still the best lead we have.

636
00:33:15,351 --> 00:33:17,280
- Password protected.
- Yeah, and knowing Riley,

637
00:33:17,305 --> 00:33:20,219
there's not a tech in the world
that's gonna be able to crack her code.

638
00:33:20,244 --> 00:33:22,477
So... now what?

639
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:25,755
We're running out of time
here... you know that, right?

640
00:33:29,105 --> 00:33:30,938
This is gonna sound weird...

641
00:33:32,795 --> 00:33:35,014
but I think I know her password.

642
00:33:35,457 --> 00:33:36,762
Yeah, it does sound weird.

643
00:33:36,787 --> 00:33:38,520
I stand next to her while she's typing.

644
00:33:38,545 --> 00:33:39,926
- What?
- A lot.

645
00:33:39,928 --> 00:33:42,472
- And I'm a very observant guy...
- Wait, you know what?

646
00:33:42,497 --> 00:33:44,898
We could talk about what
a creeper Bozer is later.

647
00:33:46,229 --> 00:33:47,570
Type.

648
00:33:51,106 --> 00:33:52,205
Nice work, Bozer.

649
00:33:52,207 --> 00:33:54,045
- No way. Did he get it?
- Yeah, he did.

650
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,575
Way to go, creepy.

651
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:57,223
Okay, it looks like
the decoding software

652
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,918
she was using on the
e-mails is still going,

653
00:33:59,943 --> 00:34:00,980
but it didn't get very far.

654
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:03,860
Okay, she has a browser
open. What was she searching?

655
00:34:03,885 --> 00:34:06,719
Properties all over the Bay Area.

656
00:34:07,075 --> 00:34:08,955
Must be at least 50 of them.

657
00:34:08,957 --> 00:34:11,614
All owned by the same guy: Russ Orwell.

658
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:14,309
And who is Russ Orwell?

659
00:34:14,403 --> 00:34:16,497
According to what Riley dug up,

660
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:18,564
Russ Orwell is the actual owner

661
00:34:18,566 --> 00:34:21,068
of the house we found
the secret room in.

662
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:22,930
Collins was an alias...

663
00:34:22,955 --> 00:34:24,670
that's why it came up clean.

664
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,623
Looks like Orwell was
a bit of a slumlord.

665
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,750
He owned all of these properties.

666
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,633
Nice work, Riley.

667
00:34:30,658 --> 00:34:32,253
So, Orwell's our guy?

668
00:34:32,554 --> 00:34:33,854
Not likely.

669
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:36,724
He was killed 15 years
ago; bludgeoned to death.

670
00:34:36,726 --> 00:34:39,115
Handwriting expert just got
to me with his final results

671
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,673
on the letter you guys got.

672
00:34:40,698 --> 00:34:42,440
- Yeah?
- It's a 100% match.

673
00:34:42,465 --> 00:34:43,521
All right, wait, wait,

674
00:34:43,546 --> 00:34:45,841
so now we are hunting
the original Zodiac?

675
00:34:45,866 --> 00:34:47,724
Actually, no.

676
00:34:47,971 --> 00:34:49,894
As people age, their
handwriting changes...

677
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:52,607
100% match means this
isn't handwriting at all.

678
00:34:52,609 --> 00:34:55,058
The ink on the letter came from
off-the-shelf computer toner...

679
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:58,212
our killer scanned the original
Zodiac letters and-and...

680
00:34:58,214 --> 00:34:59,830
- Made his own font.
- You know what, guys?

681
00:34:59,855 --> 00:35:01,681
I don't care if he was communicating

682
00:35:01,706 --> 00:35:03,306
using smoke signals.

683
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,782
Right now I just want
to find him and Riley.

684
00:35:05,807 --> 00:35:07,054
- Yeah.
- If he was using one

685
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:08,157
of Orwell's properties,

686
00:35:08,182 --> 00:35:09,465
maybe he's using another one.

687
00:35:09,528 --> 00:35:11,328
There's got to be over 50 places there.

688
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:13,714
Even if we get the SFPD's help,

689
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:15,492
by the time we search them
all it's gonna be too late.

690
00:35:15,517 --> 00:35:17,583
Well, we just got to find the right one.

691
00:35:17,585 --> 00:35:19,619
There's got to be a
dozen properties here,

692
00:35:19,621 --> 00:35:21,192
all occupied.

693
00:35:21,217 --> 00:35:22,434
He would never take her there.

694
00:35:22,459 --> 00:35:25,358
Okay, and this group right here
is in a high traffic area...

695
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,060
he wouldn't risk being
spotted moving a hostage.

696
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:29,128
Yeah.

697
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,870
Okay, so we're looking
for an unoccupied building.

698
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,710
Um...

699
00:35:34,721 --> 00:35:37,221
Didn't you say the original
Zodiac was a big fan of movies?

700
00:35:37,246 --> 00:35:38,385
Yeah. Why?

701
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,464
Yeah, I think I know
where he took her...

702
00:35:39,489 --> 00:35:40,791
Starview Way Cinema.

703
00:35:40,823 --> 00:35:42,713
Looks like an old,
abandoned movie theater.

704
00:35:49,743 --> 00:35:51,384
I understand.

705
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:58,758
Look...

706
00:35:59,117 --> 00:36:00,674
you don't have to do this.

707
00:36:01,055 --> 00:36:03,540
I don't know who you
are, I don't know...

708
00:36:03,565 --> 00:36:05,631
I haven't seen your face.

709
00:36:05,656 --> 00:36:06,891
You can let me go,

710
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:09,435
and I won't be able to tell
anyone what you look like.

711
00:36:15,857 --> 00:36:18,691
How about now, little angel?

712
00:36:19,226 --> 00:36:21,853
Now you've seen my face.

713
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:23,516
So what could you possibly say

714
00:36:23,518 --> 00:36:26,658
that would keep me from
sending you with the others?

715
00:36:50,831 --> 00:36:53,799
I'm afraid our time has come to an end.

716
00:36:59,352 --> 00:37:01,625
You can't pull the trigger, can you?

717
00:37:02,022 --> 00:37:03,955
- Shut up.
- You can't do it.

718
00:37:03,957 --> 00:37:05,311
Shut up.

719
00:37:05,336 --> 00:37:07,059
Because you know this isn't right.

720
00:37:07,061 --> 00:37:09,494
You think that I care
if you live or die?

721
00:37:09,496 --> 00:37:12,261
But you do care about
getting the details right.

722
00:37:13,409 --> 00:37:14,900
The hood... the...

723
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:16,301
the gun, the glasses,

724
00:37:16,326 --> 00:37:18,893
the... the symbol, the letters,

725
00:37:18,895 --> 00:37:20,683
the c... the code,

726
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:22,300
even the boots.

727
00:37:24,044 --> 00:37:26,804
You copied everything down
to the smallest detail.

728
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:28,444
Until now.

729
00:37:29,304 --> 00:37:31,827
Me? The girl in the movie theater?

730
00:37:31,852 --> 00:37:34,702
This... this never happened.

731
00:37:35,055 --> 00:37:37,676
The Zodiac never did this.

732
00:37:38,754 --> 00:37:40,229
You do want to be like him, don't you?

733
00:37:40,254 --> 00:37:42,512
Shut up! You don't know me!
You don't know what I want!

734
00:37:42,521 --> 00:37:44,222
The good news is,
Riley's got him talking.

735
00:37:44,247 --> 00:37:45,580
The bad news is, there's no cover

736
00:37:45,582 --> 00:37:47,648
between us and that stage.

737
00:37:48,595 --> 00:37:51,162
We can bust a move, but
he's gonna see us, man.

738
00:37:51,577 --> 00:37:53,180
He'll kill her for sure.

739
00:37:53,578 --> 00:37:55,719
I'll just have to make sure
he's looking the other way.

740
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:01,762
You were forced to improvise.

741
00:38:02,555 --> 00:38:04,731
Now if you pull that trigger...

742
00:38:06,481 --> 00:38:08,081
you break the pattern.

743
00:38:08,106 --> 00:38:10,805
If you break the pattern,
you're not the Zodiac.

744
00:38:11,379 --> 00:38:13,335
You're not even a good copycat.

745
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,750
Okay, be ready. This
is gonna happen fast.

746
00:38:15,775 --> 00:38:17,708
You're just a pathetic rip-off

747
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:20,493
who tried and failed.

748
00:38:23,754 --> 00:38:26,480
- I have to. It's too late.
- Then do it!

749
00:38:27,551 --> 00:38:28,785
Pull the trigger.

750
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,834
Show everyone what a
pale imitation you are.

751
00:38:45,566 --> 00:38:47,106
How'd you guys find me?

752
00:38:47,131 --> 00:38:48,666
With the stuff on your laptop.

753
00:38:48,691 --> 00:38:50,300
- Huh?
- Bozer knew your password.

754
00:38:50,325 --> 00:38:51,371
- He what?
- Yeah,

755
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:52,816
he figured you'd be upset about it.

756
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,316
Well, actually, I could
kiss him right now.

757
00:38:54,341 --> 00:38:57,076
Yeah, so could I, but maybe we
should find that Fauxdiac first, huh?

758
00:38:57,078 --> 00:38:58,876
- Yeah.
- Which way did he scamper off to?

759
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,322
That way.

760
00:39:03,327 --> 00:39:04,759
It's a trapdoor.

761
00:39:52,439 --> 00:39:53,782
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

762
00:39:53,798 --> 00:39:54,813
There!

763
00:40:04,648 --> 00:40:07,215
You know what else the original
Zodiac Killer never did?

764
00:40:07,752 --> 00:40:09,152
Get caught.

765
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,397
The homeless guy? What the hell?

766
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:26,178
Didn't we just hand this
bum over to the SFPD?

767
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:29,626
I guess they let him go.

768
00:40:30,423 --> 00:40:32,360
I'm sure that won't happen again.

769
00:40:40,183 --> 00:40:41,650
Riley.

770
00:40:43,033 --> 00:40:45,921
- I'm glad you're safe.
- Me, too.

771
00:40:45,923 --> 00:40:49,524
Heard I have your keen skills
of observation to thank.

772
00:40:49,526 --> 00:40:52,324
Uh, well, you know,
learning to be a spy,

773
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:54,622
I've just been practicing my...

774
00:40:54,647 --> 00:40:56,514
It's all good, Bozer.

775
00:40:57,036 --> 00:40:58,505
Seriously.

776
00:41:01,779 --> 00:41:03,256
Thanks.

777
00:41:03,281 --> 00:41:06,474
Meet Russ Orwell's son, Wyatt.

778
00:41:06,476 --> 00:41:08,139
After his father was killed,

779
00:41:08,164 --> 00:41:09,936
Wyatt was wanted for questioning,

780
00:41:10,128 --> 00:41:11,680
but the cops never could find him.

781
00:41:11,705 --> 00:41:14,482
Looks like he's been living
off the grid for years,

782
00:41:14,484 --> 00:41:17,213
using his father's money
and properties to hide.

783
00:41:17,238 --> 00:41:19,445
I can't believe we had him the
whole time and we didn't realize it.

784
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:21,667
And sent us on that wild goose chase

785
00:41:21,692 --> 00:41:23,692
looking for the real Zodiac.

786
00:41:23,694 --> 00:41:26,103
So, what about the guy
Orwell was on the phone with?

787
00:41:26,128 --> 00:41:29,030
We traced the calls to
someone on the island of Oahu,

788
00:41:29,055 --> 00:41:30,653
a Dr. Madison Grey.

789
00:41:30,678 --> 00:41:31,810
Really?

790
00:41:31,835 --> 00:41:32,950
I got an old buddy in Hawaii.

791
00:41:32,975 --> 00:41:35,347
He's on some task force out there.

792
00:41:35,372 --> 00:41:36,945
I'll give him a ring, see what's up.

793
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:38,593
Hold up a second, Jack.

794
00:41:41,976 --> 00:41:43,421
I just...

795
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:46,695
I just wanted to say thank you.

796
00:41:51,288 --> 00:41:52,603
Huh?

797
00:41:53,994 --> 00:41:56,025
- Thank you.
- Mm.

798
00:41:57,083 --> 00:41:58,593
That it?

799
00:41:58,595 --> 00:41:59,995
Don't you have a call to make?

800
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,780
- It can wait.
- No, it can't.

801
00:42:01,782 --> 00:42:03,182
Okay.

802
00:42:06,577 --> 00:42:08,913
- We'll go pack up.
- Good idea.

803
00:42:09,106 --> 00:42:11,239
Wait, hold up a second, blondie.

804
00:42:12,809 --> 00:42:14,676
I, um...

805
00:42:16,271 --> 00:42:18,957
I still have some very real concerns

806
00:42:18,982 --> 00:42:20,648
about the way you like to operate

807
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:23,051
when it comes to official fieldwork.

808
00:42:23,449 --> 00:42:24,886
Um...

809
00:42:24,888 --> 00:42:26,270
thanks?

810
00:42:26,295 --> 00:42:27,389
Shut up.

811
00:42:28,378 --> 00:42:30,846
What I'm trying to say is that...

812
00:42:31,028 --> 00:42:33,962
what you did here was
nothing short of a miracle.

813
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,974
I don't like having
to count on miracles,

814
00:42:36,999 --> 00:42:38,733
but I am...

815
00:42:38,865 --> 00:42:41,970
truly grateful that you
made one happen here.

816

1
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,742
Previously on
The Amazing Race,

2
00:00:09,827 --> 00:00:12,790
seven teams raced
to Berlin, Germany.

3
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:15,985
At the Detour,
Hung came through for the alliance...

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,813
The word is "sauerkraut."

5
00:00:17,897 --> 00:00:20,553
...but didn't feel
the love in return.

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:24,813
Leo and Alana spared

7
00:00:24,897 --> 00:00:26,400
Kaylynn and Haley
from the Yield...

8
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:27,400
We choose not to yield anyone.

9
00:00:27,484 --> 00:00:29,917
...but withheld key information.

10
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:32,089
We didn't want to be
in a race for last.

11
00:00:32,173 --> 00:00:33,503
Deangelo and Gary

12
00:00:33,587 --> 00:00:35,090
won their first leg...

13
00:00:35,174 --> 00:00:36,917
- You're team number one.
- Okay. - Yes.

14
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:39,676
...while Hung and Chee
learned a valuable lesson.

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,435
Deangelo and Gary
aren't helping the alliance.

16
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:44,469
They just bring it up
when it's helpful to them.

17
00:00:44,553 --> 00:00:46,435
Meanwhile, Kaylynn and Haley

18
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:49,158
came back from the brink
of elimination yet again.

19
00:00:49,242 --> 00:00:51,553
You're still in the race.

20
00:00:52,587 --> 00:00:54,538
Pulled it out of our hat again.

21
00:00:54,622 --> 00:00:56,538
Seven teams remain.

22
00:00:56,622 --> 00:00:59,090
Who will be eliminated next?

23
00:01:06,828 --> 00:01:08,917
It's not an elimination.

24
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:11,434
Oh, my...

25
00:01:11,518 --> 00:01:12,434
The Blonde Bandits

26
00:01:12,518 --> 00:01:14,469
had the best luck in this race.

27
00:01:14,553 --> 00:01:15,813
- You guys have nine lives.
- I know.

28
00:01:15,897 --> 00:01:17,193
The Blonde Bandits
are like that insect.

29
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,503
Like, you try to step on them

30
00:01:19,587 --> 00:01:21,607
and they always manage
to find a groove in the shoe.

31
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:23,519
They're definitely
out to win this thing.

32
00:01:24,587 --> 00:01:26,572
- Yeah.
- We got saved twice.

33
00:01:26,656 --> 00:01:28,435
We're so over being in the back.

34
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:30,439
Definitely gonna make a comeback
in the next leg.

35
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:33,174
Yeah.

36
00:01:36,036 --> 00:01:37,813
- All right, let's see where we're going.
- Go...

37
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:40,917
Fly to the city of Almaty
in Kazakhstan.

38
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:44,675
Teams will now
leave Germany and fly east

39
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,399
more than 3,500 miles
to Kazakhstan,

40
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:50,952
the largest landlocked country
in the world.

41
00:01:51,036 --> 00:01:53,813
After touching down,
teams must make their way

42
00:01:53,897 --> 00:01:56,538
- to Kazakhfilm Studio...
- Action!

43
00:01:56,622 --> 00:01:59,744
...the number one movie studio
in Central Asia,

44
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,952
and where teams
will choose a Detour.

45
00:02:03,036 --> 00:02:04,434
- All right, we're going to Kazakhstan.
- All right.

46
00:02:04,518 --> 00:02:07,089
We're leaving
in first for the first time.

47
00:02:07,173 --> 00:02:09,435
The last leg, we actually
worked with our alliance

48
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:11,607
that we have,
which is five teams,

49
00:02:11,691 --> 00:02:12,503
of the beard bros...

50
00:02:12,587 --> 00:02:14,537
Dude, this is gonna be cold.

51
00:02:14,621 --> 00:02:15,572
- ...Chee-Hu...
- Oh, oh, oh...

52
00:02:15,656 --> 00:02:16,952
Whoa.

53
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:18,020
...the boyfriends...

54
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:20,193
Kazakhstan? How exotic.

55
00:02:20,277 --> 00:02:21,537
...brother, sister and us.

56
00:02:21,621 --> 00:02:22,469
- Oh, my God.
- Kazakhstan. That's awesome.

57
00:02:22,553 --> 00:02:23,572
- We've never been there.
- Let's go.

58
00:02:23,656 --> 00:02:25,400
The goal is to get
those five teams

59
00:02:25,484 --> 00:02:27,435
- to the final five teams.
- Yeah.

60
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:32,483
Let me get two tickets to...
Almity, Kazakastan.

61
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:34,675
It's funny, because Deangelo

62
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,020
keeps bringing up
"top five," and he has

63
00:02:37,104 --> 00:02:39,503
never ever productively
helped us.

64
00:02:39,587 --> 00:02:41,193
And, potentially,
we need to protect ourselves

65
00:02:41,277 --> 00:02:43,071
- against him.
- Mm-hmm.

66
00:02:44,036 --> 00:02:46,745
I know nothing about Kazakhstan.

67
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:49,435
Our alliance
that we've actually solidified

68
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,745
is with the beards
as well as Hung and Chee.

69
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:51,952
But then there's

70
00:02:52,036 --> 00:02:53,642
that second tier that includes

71
00:02:53,726 --> 00:02:56,607
Gary and Deangelo
as well as Eswar and Aparna.

72
00:02:56,691 --> 00:02:57,848
It's nice having
those relationships

73
00:02:57,932 --> 00:02:59,918
because we have the majority.

74
00:03:00,002 --> 00:03:02,158
If we just can play
our Yields right...

75
00:03:02,242 --> 00:03:03,469
Why has no one played one?

76
00:03:03,553 --> 00:03:05,813
We're the only team
that's actually taken

77
00:03:05,897 --> 00:03:08,125
a shot at another team
with the U-Turn.

78
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:10,400
So we're hoping that maybe
one of the teams takes the lead

79
00:03:10,484 --> 00:03:11,813
and yields.

80
00:03:11,897 --> 00:03:13,987
Get some blood on their hands.

81
00:03:14,071 --> 00:03:16,125
I am so excited.

82
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:18,435
We've been together
for a little over ten months,

83
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:21,503
and the race has definitely
showed us a different way

84
00:03:21,587 --> 00:03:24,400
of living life together,
pushing each other.

85
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:27,435
Real life can be stressful, too,
sometimes, so maybe this is

86
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,002
good practice
for whatever could come next.

87
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,918
- Thank you so much.
- Danke schoen.

88
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:36,987
We are on the same flight
as all the other teams,

89
00:03:37,071 --> 00:03:38,572
- so we're super excited for an equalizer...
- Yes.

90
00:03:38,656 --> 00:03:39,848
...'cause we need it.

91
00:03:39,932 --> 00:03:41,435
We have a Speed Bump ahead.

92
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,813
- New day, new leg.
- New me.

93
00:03:42,897 --> 00:03:44,918
New us. We're coming
into the top today.

94
00:03:45,002 --> 00:03:46,036
Coming in hot.

How cool.

We're inside.
Now we're gonna make a movie.

- What do you think, Haley?
- I don't know.

110
00:05:13,553 --> 00:05:15,021
Look at this.

00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:16,399
- Oh, my God.
- Frickin' scary.

112
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,504
Oh, my God!

113

Oh, my God, you guys.
Oh, my God.

114
00:05:22,242 --> 00:05:24,504
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

115
00:05:24,588 --> 00:05:25,572
Do we grab that?

116
00:05:25,656 --> 00:05:27,882
- Uh, do we grab that?
- Oh, my God.

117
00:05:29,483 --> 00:05:32,194
Kaylynn, Kaylynn,
that's our Speed Bump.

118
00:05:32,278 --> 00:05:34,055
- Here you go.
- Here's our Speed Bump.

119
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:35,055
Look at this.

120
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:37,642
Okay, we got our Speed Bump.
This is so cute.

121
00:05:37,726 --> 00:05:39,553
"Detour."

122
00:05:43,105 --> 00:05:44,538
Genghis Khan conquered

123
00:05:44,622 --> 00:05:47,504
more territory than
any other leader in history.

124
00:05:47,588 --> 00:05:49,504
An Oscar-nominated film

125
00:05:49,588 --> 00:05:53,745
about his life in the
13th century was filmed here,

126
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:56,986
which showcased the dominance
of his mighty army.

127
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,194
After watching
this action sequence,

128
00:05:59,278 --> 00:06:02,469
teams must correctly
answer some questions

129
00:06:02,553 --> 00:06:04,538
about what they've witnessed.

130
00:06:04,622 --> 00:06:08,882
It's all in the details
to get their next clue.

131
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:10,504
Action!

132
00:06:10,588 --> 00:06:14,504
More than 250
movies have been produced

133
00:06:14,588 --> 00:06:15,606
here at Kazakhfilms.

134
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:20,021
Many of them feature
a highly trained stunt team

135
00:06:20,105 --> 00:06:22,089
who bring the action to life.

136
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:25,194
Teams must now learn
a choreographed routine.

137
00:06:25,278 --> 00:06:30,538
If they can hit their marks,
they can then drop this vase

138
00:06:30,622 --> 00:06:31,966
for their next clue.

139
00:06:33,553 --> 00:06:34,986
- Want Knockout Guy? Yeah.
- Yeah, Knockout Guy.

140
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:35,986
- Spy.
- We're doing the Spy.

141
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,711
- Knockout Guy?
- Let's go.

142
00:06:37,795 --> 00:06:39,538
- I kind of want to do Knockout.
- Let's do it.

143
00:06:39,622 --> 00:06:40,848
- Great Khan Spy. Okay.
- Okay.

144
00:06:40,932 --> 00:06:43,089
- Let's do, uh, Knockout Guy?
- Let's do it.

145
00:06:43,173 --> 00:06:45,173
Put on clothes first?

146
00:06:47,242 --> 00:06:48,504
- All right, let's do this.
- Okay.

147
00:06:48,588 --> 00:06:49,813
- All right, Speed Bump.
- Good. It might be warm.

148
00:06:49,897 --> 00:06:53,021
Having arrived last
in the previous leg,

149
00:06:53,105 --> 00:06:56,642
Kaylynn and Haley must now
complete this Speed Bump

150
00:06:56,726 --> 00:06:59,675
by applying prosthetic beards
to each other.

151
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,504
When the makeup artist
is happy with their work,

152
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,745
they'll get a clue.

153
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:05,194
Hi.

154
00:07:05,278 --> 00:07:06,572
Wow.

155
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:07,572
Awesome.

156
00:07:07,656 --> 00:07:09,588
Okay. Glue.

157
00:07:10,656 --> 00:07:12,469
Oh, I don't want this
on my face.

158
00:07:12,553 --> 00:07:15,642
We have a Speed Bump that could
take 15 to 30 minutes,

159
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,918
so that sets us back.

160
00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:18,813
So we need to knock this out
as fast as we can.

161
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,813
That looks incredible. Bravo.

162
00:07:20,897 --> 00:07:22,504
- Looks great.
- Okay.

163
00:07:22,588 --> 00:07:23,504
- You want to do me first, Haley?
- Yes.

164
00:07:23,588 --> 00:07:24,538
- Looks good.
- Okay.

165
00:07:24,622 --> 00:07:25,662
We're gonna glue her face.

166
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:28,158
Uh, is that right?

167
00:07:28,242 --> 00:07:29,538
Or is it the other way?
I think it's the other way.

168
00:07:29,622 --> 00:07:30,469
- Other way.
- Yeah?

169
00:07:30,553 --> 00:07:32,158
That's how it was laying.

170
00:07:32,242 --> 00:07:33,504
- Like that?
- You just picked it up and turned it around.

171
00:07:33,588 --> 00:07:34,813
Okay. Are you sure?

172
00:07:34,897 --> 00:07:35,882
- Y-Yeah.
- Yeah.

173
00:07:35,966 --> 00:07:37,332
The beard bros
are gonna be so upset.

174
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,675
- We're giving them a run for their money.
- We're jocking their style.

175
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,813
- Ooh.
- Oh, my God, it's so itchy.

176
00:07:41,897 --> 00:07:43,399
Da.

177
00:07:43,483 --> 00:07:44,538
- Okay.
- Thank you so much. All right, sit down.

178
00:07:44,622 --> 00:07:45,572
- Is this it?
- Let's go.

179
00:07:45,656 --> 00:07:47,882
- This is so cool, dude.
- Right here.

180
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:49,055
Okay, "Enter the training area."

181
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,158
Holy smokes.

182
00:07:51,242 --> 00:07:52,553
Wow, this is crazy.

183
00:07:55,795 --> 00:07:57,813
- Oh, my God.
- Oh!

184
00:07:57,897 --> 00:08:00,158
Who's gonna teach us? Uh,
we choose you.

185
00:08:00,242 --> 00:08:01,642
Like this?

186
00:08:01,726 --> 00:08:03,469
The routine was
really difficult. It was...

187
00:08:03,553 --> 00:08:06,158
First we had to fight
two guys with swords, then we...

188
00:08:06,242 --> 00:08:07,262
we killed those guys.

189
00:08:07,346 --> 00:08:08,469
Then we had to pick up
some shields,

190
00:08:08,553 --> 00:08:11,399
get rocks thrown at us,
with these shields,

191
00:08:11,483 --> 00:08:12,504
then we come to these guys
with axes...

192
00:08:12,588 --> 00:08:14,572
All we have is, like,
a bag of hay.

193
00:08:14,656 --> 00:08:15,745
Like, blocking it,

194
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,504
and then we run to this guy
with a spear

195
00:08:17,588 --> 00:08:19,435
who tries to jab us.

196
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:21,158
We grab his spear
and kick him down.

197
00:08:21,242 --> 00:08:23,918
And then we jump onto the mat.

198
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:25,399
It was badass.

199
00:08:25,483 --> 00:08:26,572
Do I not need this sword, Gary?

200
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:27,642
No, not yet.

201
00:08:27,726 --> 00:08:29,813
Stop walking off, like...
We got to get this going.

202
00:08:29,897 --> 00:08:32,158
- What you got to do?
- Pick up that, you block it and step over.

203
00:08:32,242 --> 00:08:33,538
- Where's the-the...
- They're all right there.

204
00:08:33,622 --> 00:08:34,711
Ah, okay.

205
00:08:34,795 --> 00:08:36,434
Is that the kahn up there?

206
00:08:36,518 --> 00:08:37,518
Let's go!

207
00:08:39,277 --> 00:08:40,745
Oh, wow.

208
00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:42,193
This is awesome.

209
00:08:42,277 --> 00:08:44,504
We were transported into this

210
00:08:44,588 --> 00:08:46,588
ancient Kazakh village.

211
00:08:47,518 --> 00:08:48,779
Look at that. Oh, my God.

212
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:51,986
One side it was
the great khan, the leader.

213
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,434
The set was just so detailed.

214
00:08:54,518 --> 00:08:57,104
The armor on the knights,
like, everything.

215
00:09:01,242 --> 00:09:03,399
Oh, my God, this is incredible.

216
00:09:03,483 --> 00:09:05,449
What's gonna happen?

217
00:09:10,725 --> 00:09:11,641
Oh, my God.

218
00:09:14,483 --> 00:09:15,399
Ah, look at this.

219
00:09:15,483 --> 00:09:17,416
Holy cow.

220
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:27,725
- Crazy.
- Wow.

221
00:09:35,104 --> 00:09:37,572
There's lots and
lots of things going on.

222
00:09:37,656 --> 00:09:39,641
- It's just sensory overload.
- The Detour said

223
00:09:39,725 --> 00:09:42,399
we had to answer some
questions from the khan,

224
00:09:42,483 --> 00:09:44,504
but the problem is, we didn't
know what the questions were,

225
00:09:44,588 --> 00:09:45,948
so we had no idea
what to look for.

226
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,538
First team, follow me.

227
00:10:03,622 --> 00:10:05,725
The great khan demands
to speak with you.

228
00:10:10,104 --> 00:10:13,399
How many horses entered
the village during the battle?

229
00:10:13,483 --> 00:10:14,918
- Six.
- Six.

230
00:10:15,002 --> 00:10:16,070
Six.

231
00:10:17,174 --> 00:10:20,434
How many warriors in the battle
fought with an ax?

232
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:21,918
- I didn't see how many axes.
- I can't even...

233
00:10:22,002 --> 00:10:23,504
- There were definitely four.
- Okay.

234
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:24,641
Four.

235
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:26,641
How many warriors in the battle

236
00:10:26,725 --> 00:10:27,504
carried spears?

237
00:10:27,588 --> 00:10:29,504
- I think...
- I want to say, uh, six.

238
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:31,158
- Okay.
- Six.

239
00:10:31,242 --> 00:10:33,813
How many times did the great
khan call out to his warriors

240
00:10:33,897 --> 00:10:35,468
during the battle?

241
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,986
- Maybe two.
- Uh, okay.

242
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,158
Okay.

243
00:10:39,242 --> 00:10:41,158
Two.

244
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:42,572
Unfortunately,
you have not answered

245
00:10:42,656 --> 00:10:43,933
the questions correctly.

246
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:46,552
- We know it's not...
- Yes.

247
00:10:48,174 --> 00:10:51,193
How many horses entered
the village during the battle?

248
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:53,434
- Um...
- 15 horses.

249
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:56,572
How many warriors in the battle
fought with an ax?

250
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,676
Eight.

251
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,468
How many warriors in the battle
carried spears?

252
00:11:00,552 --> 00:11:02,020
Seven.

253
00:11:02,104 --> 00:11:05,641
How many times did the great
khan call out to his warriors?

254
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:06,918
- Three.
- Unfortunately,

255
00:11:07,002 --> 00:11:09,020
you could not answer
the questions correctly.

256
00:11:09,104 --> 00:11:10,641
Okay.

257
00:11:10,725 --> 00:11:12,449
I think we know
what we're missing.

258
00:11:13,795 --> 00:11:15,399
Yes. Please, I have to get this.

259
00:11:15,483 --> 00:11:16,552
Stay still.

260
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,504
Oh, my God, this feels so gross.

261
00:11:19,588 --> 00:11:21,158
- Feels so...
- Ugh.

262
00:11:21,242 --> 00:11:23,572
- Thank you so much!
- Oh, thank you so much.

263
00:11:23,656 --> 00:11:25,434
- Knockout Guy. We're gonna go to Knockout Guy.
- We're gonna go smash stuff.

264
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,641
- "A limited number of teams...
- Uh-oh, uh-oh.

265
00:11:26,725 --> 00:11:28,641
...may perform either Detour."

266
00:11:28,725 --> 00:11:30,468
Seven...

267
00:11:30,552 --> 00:11:33,056
All right. Excuse me.

268
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,813
- All right, all right.
- Okay. We got this.

269
00:11:34,897 --> 00:11:36,849
Knockout Guy, Knockout Guy.
This way.

270
00:11:36,933 --> 00:11:38,572
Is everything full?

271
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,813
No swords? Everything's full?

272
00:11:40,897 --> 00:11:42,504
- Okay.
- Then we should go to the next.

273
00:11:42,588 --> 00:11:44,641
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God. This sucks.

274
00:11:44,725 --> 00:11:46,918
Now we're going to the Spy one?

275
00:11:47,002 --> 00:11:50,158
I hate these challenges.

276
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,056
Hi, guys.
You're gonna take part

277
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,745
- in an action film.
- All right.

278
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:55,641
This is the set.

279
00:11:55,725 --> 00:11:57,158
This is so cool.

280
00:11:57,242 --> 00:11:59,399
We had to perform in,
like, a real movie,

281
00:11:59,483 --> 00:12:01,468
like, we might be in a movie

282
00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:02,676
from Kazakhstan.

283
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:05,434
Roll sound!

284
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:06,622
Roll camera!

285
00:12:08,518 --> 00:12:10,104
Action!

286
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:14,813
When we get thrown
into the real thing,

287
00:12:14,897 --> 00:12:16,020
there's, like,
all chaos breaking loose,

288
00:12:16,104 --> 00:12:18,158
and, like, all those
choreographed movements

289
00:12:18,242 --> 00:12:21,434
became, like, way more difficult
because it's in real time now

290
00:12:21,518 --> 00:12:22,813
- and you got to just...
- It came way faster at us.

291
00:12:22,897 --> 00:12:24,483
We got this. Let's go, let's go.

292
00:12:26,104 --> 00:12:27,588
Yeah!

293
00:12:39,174 --> 00:12:41,656
- Keep pushing.
- We got this.

294
00:12:42,725 --> 00:12:43,676
One, two, three.

295
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,572
Hey!

296
00:12:51,656 --> 00:12:54,538
Travel by van
to a remote nomad village

297
00:12:54,622 --> 00:12:56,056
in the Karasay District.
Yield ahead.

298
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,813
This is an opportunity for teams
to stop another team racing

299
00:13:00,897 --> 00:13:02,813
by using their hourglass.

300
00:13:02,897 --> 00:13:04,572
"There are only a few legs left
to use your power to yield.

301
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:05,572
Don't waste it."

302
00:13:05,656 --> 00:13:08,468
- Duck...
- Come on, let's go.

303
00:13:08,552 --> 00:13:10,090
Block, step over the thing.

304
00:13:10,174 --> 00:13:11,504
Bro, stop it.

305
00:13:11,588 --> 00:13:12,641
You don't got to redo it.
You know what it is.

306
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:13,641
Gary, stop teaching me.

307
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:15,020
I was taking my time

308
00:13:15,104 --> 00:13:16,572
because I wanted to make sure
that I had it down pat.

309
00:13:16,656 --> 00:13:18,090
I'm like, dude, if I mess up,

310
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:19,676
we're gonna have
to redo this over again.

311
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,676
So,
there's two teams ahead of us

312
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,158
and you can only do
one challenge at a time,

313
00:13:22,242 --> 00:13:24,813
so I got to wait on him
to finish practicing.

314
00:13:24,897 --> 00:13:26,399
- Here?
- No, kick.

315
00:13:26,483 --> 00:13:27,504
You weren't watching. Kick.

316
00:13:27,588 --> 00:13:28,918
I don't know
what's taking so long.

317
00:13:29,002 --> 00:13:30,572
Oh!

318
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:32,056
- Here we go.
- They're already out.

319
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,227
Let's go.

320
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,986
- Relax, bro. Relax.
- You don't understand.

321
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,538
- We're last right now.
- So?

322
00:13:36,622 --> 00:13:38,813
What do you mean, "so?"
I learned all of it.

323
00:13:38,897 --> 00:13:40,918
Well, good for you.
Congratulations.

324
00:13:41,002 --> 00:13:42,745
- You learned something today.
- Yeah.

325
00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:44,483
- You were taking forever.
- Bro, shut up.

326
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:51,158
- Okay.
- Let's go, D. We're last now.

327
00:13:51,242 --> 00:13:52,504
- Where's your knife?
- I don't have one.

328
00:13:52,588 --> 00:13:53,813
- Same place yours is.
- Exactly. Exactly.

329
00:13:53,897 --> 00:13:55,090
Exactly. Why you rushing me?

330
00:13:55,174 --> 00:13:56,538
You don't even have
a damn knife.

331
00:13:56,622 --> 00:13:58,468
We're gonna fight,

332
00:13:58,552 --> 00:14:00,056
but we air out
our grievances right away.

333
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,641
- And we get over it.
- Yeah. We get it

334
00:14:01,725 --> 00:14:03,158
out of the way
and then we move forward.

335
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,883
- How do you keep on losing...
- Uh, it's not...

336
00:14:04,967 --> 00:14:07,538
- They're tied.
- Gary, relax, bro. Calm down.

337
00:14:07,622 --> 00:14:10,504
- We got to get a taxi.
- Where is it?

338
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:11,849
No idea.

339
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:13,641
- You think he's in there?
- All right, I think he's in there.

340
00:14:13,725 --> 00:14:15,641
- This one? Maybe?
- All right.

341
00:14:15,725 --> 00:14:17,399
In here?

342
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:18,883
- Okay.
- Thank you.

343
00:14:18,967 --> 00:14:20,365
We have such
a high that we're still here.

344
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:22,434
Growing up, we went through
a little bit of a rough patch

345
00:14:22,518 --> 00:14:23,362
with our family.

346
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:26,193
I moved out at 15
and Haley moved out at 16.

347
00:14:26,277 --> 00:14:28,434
I grew up thinking
that we had bad luck.

348
00:14:28,518 --> 00:14:29,986
I was thinking that, like,
the world was against us.

349
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,056
But now I think
that Haley and I are

350
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,468
very much capable
of winning this race.

351
00:14:33,552 --> 00:14:36,711
We just realized that Haley glued the hair up my nose.

352
00:14:41,483 --> 00:14:44,090
The first go-around,
we had no strategy,

353
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,641
but once we heard
the set of questions,

354
00:14:45,725 --> 00:14:47,449
we knew exactly
what to look for.

355
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,641
We were trying
to remember the questions

356
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:55,504
and by the second time,
we already started

357
00:14:55,588 --> 00:14:57,020
to learn the battle.

358
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,158
One, two.

359
00:14:58,242 --> 00:14:59,676
Damn it.

360
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,641
They already finished.

361
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:03,449
First team, follow me.

362
00:15:05,242 --> 00:15:08,572
How many horses entered
the village during the battle?

363
00:15:08,656 --> 00:15:09,918
Six.

364
00:15:10,002 --> 00:15:11,883
How many warriors in the battle

365
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:13,090
fought with an ax?

366
00:15:13,174 --> 00:15:14,193
One.

367
00:15:14,277 --> 00:15:16,986
How many warriors in the battle
carried spears?

368
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,263
Five.

369
00:15:18,347 --> 00:15:21,056
How many times did the great
khan call out to his warriors

370
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,676
during the battle?

371
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,795
Zero.

372
00:15:26,518 --> 00:15:27,676
Congratulations.

373
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,468
- Thank you. Spasibo.
- Thank you.

374
00:15:29,552 --> 00:15:30,572
Spasibo.

375
00:15:30,656 --> 00:15:31,813
Okay, let's go, let's go.

376
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:33,434
- Good job.
- Thank you, thank you.

377
00:15:33,518 --> 00:15:35,090
- Was that Haley and K...
- It was, it was.

378
00:15:35,174 --> 00:15:36,449
- With mustaches?
- Yeah.

379
00:15:37,933 --> 00:15:39,849
How many horses
entered the village?

380
00:15:39,933 --> 00:15:42,158
Six.

381
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:44,676
How many warriors in the battle
carried spears?

382
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,504
18.

383
00:15:47,588 --> 00:15:48,918
Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?

384
00:15:49,002 --> 00:15:50,158
This is...

385
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:51,711
- Okay, Aparna.
- Okay, ready?

386
00:15:51,795 --> 00:15:53,504
Roll camera!

387
00:15:53,588 --> 00:15:55,504
- Action!
- Come on.

388
00:15:58,656 --> 00:16:00,986
Stop, stop.

389
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,676
- Oh, my God.
- We needed to scream more.

390
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,641
I mean, that's just the way
that I would fight.

391
00:16:05,725 --> 00:16:06,745
Just a lot more calm.

392
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:08,504
But I guess we're trying
to mimic, like,

393
00:16:08,588 --> 00:16:09,813
a 13th-century Kazakh fight.

394
00:16:12,588 --> 00:16:14,193
Hi. Do you know English?

395
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:17,090
- Riley, let's go.
- Wait, is there another team ahead of us?

396
00:16:17,174 --> 00:16:18,468
Come on, go, go, go.

397
00:16:18,552 --> 00:16:19,986
- What's your name?
- Uh, Norvan.

398
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,158
"Noblang"?

399
00:16:21,242 --> 00:16:22,918
We're number one right now.
Number one.

400
00:16:23,002 --> 00:16:24,676
- Hello.
- So, welcome on set.

401
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,813
- Ooh, this is fun.
- Action!

402
00:16:35,174 --> 00:16:36,849
Wait, I'm first,
I'm first, I'm first, I'm first,

403
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:38,213
I'm first, I'm first, I'm first.

404
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,434
- Go back.
- I'm first.

405
00:16:40,518 --> 00:16:41,745
I had to go first,

406
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:44,572
but James went ahead of me and
they were like, "Cut, cut, cut."

407
00:16:44,656 --> 00:16:45,760
Sorry, Will.

408
00:16:46,795 --> 00:16:47,986
Yep.

409
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,158
Roll sound!

410
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:50,399
Roll camera!

411
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:55,538
Action!

412
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,813
We got this.

413
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,656
Let's go.

414
00:17:07,483 --> 00:17:08,366
Hurry up. Come on, let's go.

415
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,483
Stop, stop. That is wrong here.

416
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:13,813
Well, you got to hurry up.

417
00:17:13,897 --> 00:17:15,537
- Follow me.
- Oh.

418
00:17:15,621 --> 00:17:17,572
- Oh, my gosh. Okay, okay.
- Oh.

419
00:17:17,656 --> 00:17:19,399
- All right, Haley, look around.
- Look around at everything.

420
00:17:19,483 --> 00:17:20,621
Okay.

421
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:25,399
Oh, God. Okay.

422
00:17:25,483 --> 00:17:27,399
Okay, so he just got shot.

423
00:17:27,483 --> 00:17:29,105
Okay...

424
00:17:32,621 --> 00:17:34,070
Okay, so six of these horsemen.

425
00:17:37,588 --> 00:17:38,468
Not sure.

426
00:17:38,552 --> 00:17:39,572
It was really hard to tell

427
00:17:39,656 --> 00:17:41,399
which spears counted.

428
00:17:41,483 --> 00:17:44,090
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

429
00:17:44,174 --> 00:17:45,676
Okay, so now the
ladies... they're pushing them out.

430
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,986
The villagers won.

431
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,416
The great khan demands
to speak with you.

432
00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:55,021
How many horses entered
the village during the battle?

433
00:17:55,105 --> 00:17:56,158
Six.

434
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,849
How many warriors in the battle
fought with an ax?

435
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:01,813
I have no idea.

436
00:18:01,897 --> 00:18:03,227
Fifteen.

437
00:18:03,311 --> 00:18:05,435
So our first run
of questions from the khan,

438
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:06,676
the only one we knew
were the horses.

439
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,537
And so we were like, "Oh, crap."

440
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,090
Okay.

441
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:11,332
- Okay.
- Okay. Thank you.

442
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,918
- We'll come back. That was insane.
- Wowzers. That was...

443
00:18:14,002 --> 00:18:15,537
Okay,
we know now what to look for.

444
00:18:15,621 --> 00:18:18,504
How many warriors in the battle
carried spears?

445
00:18:18,588 --> 00:18:19,399
Sixteen.

446
00:18:19,483 --> 00:18:21,070
Okay.

447
00:18:23,483 --> 00:18:24,263
Roll camera!

448
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:26,829
Action!

449
00:18:31,483 --> 00:18:32,572
Stop, stop!

450
00:18:32,656 --> 00:18:34,552
Ooh, come on.

451
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:37,641
All right, let's do this.

452
00:18:37,725 --> 00:18:39,588
Action!

453
00:18:48,483 --> 00:18:49,552
Run, run.

454
00:18:54,552 --> 00:18:55,641
Yes. Go.

455
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,986
- Oh, they got it. That sucks.
- Yep.

456
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,813
Oh, good. Oh, thank God.

457
00:19:04,897 --> 00:19:06,813
We were slaying
in Kazakhstan today.

458
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:10,399
Kazakh-slay.

459
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,002
Action!

460
00:19:31,242 --> 00:19:32,656
There it is.

461
00:19:34,552 --> 00:19:35,760
You watch there, Kaylynn.

462
00:19:36,965 --> 00:19:40,031
Some of the spears
had flags on them,

463
00:19:40,116 --> 00:19:41,032
so I didn't count them.

464
00:19:41,117 --> 00:19:42,313
I only counted the,
just, straight-up spears

465
00:19:42,397 --> 00:19:44,762
that I saw, and there were five.

466
00:19:44,847 --> 00:19:46,985
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

467
00:19:50,278 --> 00:19:52,893
I-I've lost count.

468
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,405
- Yeah.
- Okay, we got to do this correctly.

469
00:19:56,489 --> 00:19:58,550
Keep making noises
the whole time.

470
00:19:58,635 --> 00:19:59,688
Action!

471
00:20:05,456 --> 00:20:07,298
I was just doing
pointless yelling.

472
00:20:27,937 --> 00:20:29,508
Oh, perfect.

473
00:20:29,592 --> 00:20:31,816
"There are only a few legs left
to use the power to yield.

474
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,128
Don't waste it." Let's go.

475
00:20:33,213 --> 00:20:34,868
My voice is tired.

476
00:20:36,347 --> 00:20:39,733
How many horses entered
the village during the battle?

477
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,094
Six.

478
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:43,785
How many warriors in the battle
fought with an ax?

479
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,268
One.

480
00:20:45,353 --> 00:20:47,683
How many warriors in the battle
carried spears?

481
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:50,393
- Five.
- How many times did the great khan

482
00:20:50,478 --> 00:20:52,394
call out to his warriors
during the battle?

483
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:54,899
- Zero.
- Very good.

484
00:20:57,192 --> 00:20:58,688
- Thank God.
- They got it. Damn it.

485
00:20:58,772 --> 00:21:01,653
How many warriors in the battle
carried spears?

486
00:21:02,464 --> 00:21:03,554
Ten?

487
00:21:05,743 --> 00:21:06,773
No. Oh, my God.

488
00:21:06,858 --> 00:21:08,963
- We both need to count spears.
- Okay.

489
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,004
This is cool.

490
00:21:16,088 --> 00:21:18,451
- We're definitely not in the city anymore.
- Yes, definitely remote.

491
00:21:18,535 --> 00:21:19,906
So different, it's so beautiful.

492
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,695
- It's...
- We would never think to travel here

493
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:22,901
in a million years, but...

494
00:21:22,986 --> 00:21:24,383
Oh, there's a yurt
to the right, Hung.

495
00:21:24,467 --> 00:21:25,724
Oh, yes.

496
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:28,105
- Thank you.
- Spasibo.

497
00:21:28,212 --> 00:21:30,370
Go, go, go.

498
00:21:32,414 --> 00:21:33,503
Oh, look, Chee.

499
00:21:34,032 --> 00:21:35,895
This is amazing.

500
00:21:38,287 --> 00:21:39,584
This is awesome.

501
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:43,597
Yield.

502
00:21:43,682 --> 00:21:44,984
We choose not to yield anybody.

503
00:21:45,468 --> 00:21:46,986
"Route Info."

504
00:21:48,668 --> 00:21:52,135
Yurts are synonymous
with nomadic people.

505
00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:54,962
A lightweight,
compact portable home

506
00:21:55,046 --> 00:21:57,858
that can be quickly assembled
wherever a nomad

507
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,894
wants to spend the night.

508
00:21:59,978 --> 00:22:02,480
It's one thing,
having a roof over your head,

509
00:22:02,564 --> 00:22:05,135
but what you do with the
interior can be the difference

510
00:22:05,219 --> 00:22:09,031
between roughing it
and living in style.

511
00:22:09,115 --> 00:22:12,376
Teams must choose a camel
laden with possessions,

512
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,100
lead it to an empty yurt,

513
00:22:14,184 --> 00:22:16,239
and then arrange
the items inside as shown

514
00:22:16,323 --> 00:22:20,031
in the finished example,
including a local delicacy:

515
00:22:20,115 --> 00:22:22,927
cooked lamb's head.

516
00:22:23,011 --> 00:22:24,323
- Come on.
- Let's run.

517
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,239
Hello.

518
00:22:28,323 --> 00:22:29,962
He's a big dude.

519
00:22:30,046 --> 00:22:31,046
Can you take us?

520
00:22:35,115 --> 00:22:36,287
Okay.

521
00:22:38,046 --> 00:22:39,962
We choose not to yield anyone.

522
00:22:40,046 --> 00:22:41,858
Zero. 'Cause we're nice guys.

523
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:46,927
Holy cow.

524
00:22:47,011 --> 00:22:48,789
Grab that side. It's heavy. Yep.

525
00:22:48,873 --> 00:22:50,722
Golly.

526
00:22:50,807 --> 00:22:52,756
- Let's take inventory of what we have.
- Yeah.

527
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,480
We basically just had to
copy the inside of a yurt exactly.

528
00:22:56,564 --> 00:23:00,445
And there were rugs, mats,
tables, bowls.

529
00:23:00,529 --> 00:23:02,411
Everything had to be perfect.

530
00:23:02,495 --> 00:23:04,308
- Colorful mat, tan mat.
- Colorful mat...

531
00:23:04,392 --> 00:23:06,952
We just need to be methodical,
get it right the first time.

532
00:23:17,978 --> 00:23:19,272
Okay.

533
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,308
You're sure of that?

534
00:23:20,392 --> 00:23:22,150
- I just don't know.
- Damn it.

535
00:23:25,495 --> 00:23:28,376
How many warriors in the battle
carried spears?

536
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,789
Nine.

537
00:23:29,873 --> 00:23:31,962
Are you kidding me?

538
00:23:32,046 --> 00:23:34,789
This sucks.
I am just so frustrated.

539
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:36,411
We just had to count,

540
00:23:36,495 --> 00:23:37,548
and it was so hard.

541
00:23:37,632 --> 00:23:40,411
I don't know why
this is so hard for us.

542
00:23:40,495 --> 00:23:42,239
We've had epiphanies before,

543
00:23:42,323 --> 00:23:44,203
and I have faith
that that'll happen again.

544
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:47,066
Leo remains more optimistic
in these kinds of circumstances.

545
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,584
And he calms me down.

546
00:23:49,668 --> 00:23:51,203
We know how
to support each other

547
00:23:51,287 --> 00:23:52,858
and stay steady and strong.

548
00:23:52,942 --> 00:23:54,873
We're gonna do our best.

549
00:23:56,287 --> 00:23:57,376
What do you want to do?

550
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,617
We choose not to yield.

551
00:23:58,701 --> 00:24:00,135
- Let's go.
- Hopefully a team behind us

552
00:24:00,219 --> 00:24:01,308
will use their Yield.

553
00:24:01,392 --> 00:24:02,840
How cool.

554
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,962
We choose not to yield anybody.

555
00:24:06,046 --> 00:24:07,239
We decided not to yield

556
00:24:07,323 --> 00:24:09,323
because we felt like
we had a big enough lead.

557
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,135
Just, uh, like, uh,

558
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:14,411
volleyball-net tie it.

559
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:16,548
Just the slipknot.
That's how you tie the nets.

560
00:24:16,632 --> 00:24:19,135
We've tied a million of them
growing, growing up.

561
00:24:19,219 --> 00:24:21,927
This thing is frozen.

562
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:23,239
It is really cold out here.

563
00:24:23,323 --> 00:24:24,445
It's just gonna get harder
and harder and harder.

564
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:27,858
Right now my mustache has,
like, icicles growing on it.

565
00:24:27,942 --> 00:24:29,203
I'm gonna die.

566
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:32,376
Hey, guys, did you see
the blondes here?

567
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,789
- No.
- It's only us. Okay.

568
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:34,686
We choose not to yield anybody.

569
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:37,203
We got to the Yield board third,

570
00:24:37,287 --> 00:24:38,858
and nobody was yielded yet.

571
00:24:38,942 --> 00:24:41,031
Neither Gary and Deangelo
as well as Eswar and Aparna

572
00:24:41,115 --> 00:24:43,962
used either,
so now we're just down

573
00:24:44,046 --> 00:24:45,858
to the blondies
and Leo and Alana.

574
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,480
Our number one, I would say,
"target" in the race

575
00:24:48,564 --> 00:24:49,927
has been Leo and Alana.

576
00:24:50,011 --> 00:24:52,548
They're one of the few teams
who have been at the bottom

577
00:24:52,632 --> 00:24:55,308
that have been able to, like,
penetrate the top three spots.

578
00:24:55,392 --> 00:24:57,962
And I also think they're a team
that would use a Yield on us,

579
00:24:58,046 --> 00:25:00,962
or U-Turn us, and I don't want that.

580
00:25:01,046 --> 00:25:02,962
There is a Yield ahead.

581
00:25:03,046 --> 00:25:04,789
God, I don't know what to do.

582
00:25:04,873 --> 00:25:07,480
- Ugh.
- I know.

583
00:25:07,564 --> 00:25:08,894
- Let's get there...
- Do what our heart and gut

584
00:25:08,978 --> 00:25:10,315
- tells us when we see it.
- Yeah, you're right.

585
00:25:19,287 --> 00:25:21,219
Those are flags.
We have to guess five.

586
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,376
It's the only thing that makes
any sort of sense to me

587
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,978
is to guess five.

588
00:25:35,046 --> 00:25:37,927
How many warriors in the battle
carried spears?

589
00:25:38,011 --> 00:25:39,203
Five.

590
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,239
How many times did the great
khan call out to his warriors

591
00:25:42,323 --> 00:25:43,825
during the battle?

592
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:44,858
Zero.

593
00:25:45,942 --> 00:25:47,529
- Oh, my God.
- Thank you.

594
00:25:50,287 --> 00:25:51,376
"Yield ahead.
There are only a few legs left

595
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,239
to use the power of Yield.
Don't waste it."

596
00:25:53,323 --> 00:25:54,411
All right, let's go.

597
00:25:55,978 --> 00:25:58,239
I hope we were not yielded.

598
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:00,287
Thank you.

599
00:26:02,356 --> 00:26:04,894
I genuinely can't feel my toes.

600
00:26:04,978 --> 00:26:07,203
I just
can't feel my fingers.

601
00:26:07,287 --> 00:26:10,066
Probably, like,
negative ten degrees.

602
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,100
- Are your feet frozen?
- A little bit.

603
00:26:12,184 --> 00:26:15,135
My fingers are really
about to fall off right now.

604
00:26:15,219 --> 00:26:17,066
Doesn't help with,
uh, big fingers

605
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,825
to try and make knots and stuff.

606
00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:21,203
He's saying "big
fingers," I'm saying "cold."

607
00:26:21,287 --> 00:26:22,894
No, I'm not even cold.
I'm actually hot right now.

608
00:26:22,978 --> 00:26:24,806
Oh. That's good for you.

609
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,480
Okay, Haley.

610
00:26:27,564 --> 00:26:28,927
- This one doesn't have a tie.
- The blondies are here.

611
00:26:29,011 --> 00:26:30,927
- Do we go to the Yield first?
- Yeah.

612
00:26:31,011 --> 00:26:32,031
Should we go tell them
to use their Yield?

613
00:26:32,115 --> 00:26:34,272
Yell it, yell it, yell it.

614
00:26:34,356 --> 00:26:35,825
- What do you think? Okay.
- No.

615
00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:36,894
- You said no, right?
- Yeah.

616
00:26:36,978 --> 00:26:38,480
- Girls! Girls!
- Okay.

617
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:41,894
There's one team behind you!
It's Leo and Alana!

618
00:26:41,978 --> 00:26:43,548
- Thank you.
- Is this hard?

619
00:26:43,632 --> 00:26:44,514
- What? Yes.
- Is this hard?

620
00:26:44,598 --> 00:26:47,308
You want this cushion of time,
I promise.

621
00:26:47,392 --> 00:26:50,066
If you have 20 minutes,
this is the time to use it!

622
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,962
Oh, Leo and Alana
haven't showed up yet?

623
00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:52,962
No.

624
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:54,480
You got to yield them, girls!

625
00:26:54,564 --> 00:26:56,272
This thing takes forever.

626
00:26:56,356 --> 00:26:58,411
Yeah, you got to yield.

627
00:26:58,495 --> 00:27:00,894
Kaylynn and Haley
obviously wouldn't yield us,

628
00:27:00,978 --> 00:27:02,066
'cause we have, like,
a really close friendship.

629
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:05,031
Guys, you got to do it
if you want to stay in the race!

630
00:27:05,115 --> 00:27:06,376
What do you think?

631
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,548
- We trust them.
- Yeah.

632
00:27:07,632 --> 00:27:08,909
Do it!

633
00:27:13,978 --> 00:27:15,927
Guys, you got to do it
if you want to stay in the race!

634
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:17,548
What do you think?

635
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,135
They want us to.

636
00:27:19,219 --> 00:27:20,480
- Do it.
- Let's do it.

637
00:27:20,564 --> 00:27:21,789
Haley and I are yielding
Leo and Alana.

638
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:24,584
- We feel bad.
- We're sorry, guys. This is our only chance.

639
00:27:24,668 --> 00:27:26,806
It's everyone's game
for themselves.

640
00:27:28,287 --> 00:27:29,445
They're doing it.

641
00:27:29,529 --> 00:27:31,584
Oh, that's legendary.

642
00:27:31,668 --> 00:27:35,135
- Good job, James.
- Divide and conquer.

643
00:27:35,219 --> 00:27:37,203
- Was that bad for me to yell, though?
- Come on.

644
00:27:37,287 --> 00:27:39,445
It's for a million dollars,
not for best friends.

645
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:41,115
It's not
The Amazing Best Friend Race.

646
00:27:43,632 --> 00:27:46,203
- Oh, my God.
- Hey. This was our Roadblock, y'all.

647
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:49,203
- We-we found our brothers.
- Wow.

648
00:27:49,287 --> 00:27:50,376
Give me a beard bump.

649
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,789
Yeah. Ugh...

650
00:27:52,873 --> 00:27:54,203
God, that looks so...

651
00:27:54,287 --> 00:27:55,789
It looks better on you guys
than it does on us.

652
00:28:04,011 --> 00:28:05,376
- Uh... we don't...
- It looks like...

653
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,411
It looks like a head
of an animal. We need that.

654
00:28:07,495 --> 00:28:08,997
Oh, that seems pretty important.

655
00:28:09,081 --> 00:28:13,135
- We need to find it.
- Maybe more stuff up ahead or something?

656
00:28:13,219 --> 00:28:16,203
- Oh, wow.
- Thank you, thanks.

657
00:28:16,287 --> 00:28:18,789
The last thing we had to
put out was the lamb/sheep's head,

658
00:28:18,873 --> 00:28:19,894
but that didn't come
with our camel.

659
00:28:19,978 --> 00:28:21,100
We had to go find that

660
00:28:21,184 --> 00:28:22,962
near the model yurt
where these older ladies

661
00:28:23,046 --> 00:28:24,376
were cooking in-in a pot.

662
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,376
So when we realized that,
we were like,

663
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,825
"Oh, that must be one of
the big secrets

664
00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:29,135
that you had to figure out."

665
00:28:29,219 --> 00:28:31,584
Do we need to come back
with a tray, or what?

666
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,927
- Let's come back for it later.
- Okay.

667
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:35,308
Okay, thank you. Nice job.

668
00:28:35,392 --> 00:28:37,927
We need to get a deer head.

669
00:28:38,011 --> 00:28:39,203
- Deer head?
- I think we have to get it

670
00:28:39,287 --> 00:28:40,962
- from the villagers.
- Okay.

671
00:28:41,046 --> 00:28:42,411
Then we're done.

672
00:28:42,495 --> 00:28:45,135
- There's a skull, too.
- Put one in this?

673
00:28:45,219 --> 00:28:47,203
There's... That's all we got.

674
00:28:47,287 --> 00:28:48,548
That's all we were given.

675
00:28:48,632 --> 00:28:50,978
- You want to get a check?
- Yeah. Can we get a check?

676
00:28:52,668 --> 00:28:54,962
Oh, man.

677
00:28:55,046 --> 00:28:56,460
Spasibo.

678
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:07,460
- Cool.
- Okay.

679
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,858
Um, what is it?

680
00:29:09,942 --> 00:29:12,239
That's it. Gross.

681
00:29:12,323 --> 00:29:13,962
Mmm.

682
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:15,411
You can't have a complete yurt

683
00:29:15,495 --> 00:29:17,480
- without a good lamb's head.
- Without a good, just, head.

684
00:29:17,564 --> 00:29:19,323
Just a good head.

685
00:29:21,287 --> 00:29:22,858
Yeah, the head. Get the head.

686
00:29:22,942 --> 00:29:24,789
Good work.

687
00:29:24,873 --> 00:29:26,115
Check?

688
00:29:27,873 --> 00:29:30,046
We tried to make it
as homey as possible.

689
00:29:32,495 --> 00:29:34,480
- For real? Oh, my gosh.
- Yes, yes, yes.

690
00:29:37,873 --> 00:29:39,031
Thank you.

691
00:29:39,115 --> 00:29:40,858
"Travel to Zelenyy Bazar

692
00:29:40,942 --> 00:29:44,203
"in Almaty and search
the meat market

693
00:29:44,287 --> 00:29:45,239
for your next clue."

694
00:29:45,323 --> 00:29:46,978
Oh, my God, let's go.

695
00:29:49,632 --> 00:29:51,312
Lot better than the first time,
huh?

696
00:29:52,392 --> 00:29:54,115
Bummer.

697
00:29:55,219 --> 00:29:56,480
This one is here.

698
00:29:56,564 --> 00:29:58,287
Let's look at that.

699
00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:02,445
I... The only
idea I can come up with is

700
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:05,789
move these big, huge heavy rugs
so that it's flush.

701
00:30:05,873 --> 00:30:06,927
Move these there
so that the center is...

702
00:30:07,011 --> 00:30:08,858
- So that the center is...
- Perfect center.

703
00:30:08,942 --> 00:30:10,135
...is centered.

704
00:30:10,219 --> 00:30:11,894
Dude, no.

705
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:14,018
- What did we screw up on?
- I don't know.

706
00:30:15,323 --> 00:30:17,150
I seriously have no clue.

707
00:30:18,495 --> 00:30:20,031
Maddison, you come this way.

708
00:30:20,115 --> 00:30:21,789
Maddison spotted that the rugs

709
00:30:21,873 --> 00:30:22,789
needed to be switched.

710
00:30:22,873 --> 00:30:24,308
Hopefully that's it,

711
00:30:24,392 --> 00:30:26,894
because with these challenges,
there's always, like,

712
00:30:26,978 --> 00:30:29,548
one small detail

713
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,894
that you can easily miss.

714
00:30:30,978 --> 00:30:32,308
He looks happy already.

715
00:30:32,392 --> 00:30:34,031
- Yeah.
- Yes!

716
00:30:34,115 --> 00:30:35,894
Okay, where do we go?

717
00:30:35,978 --> 00:30:37,806
Ooh, I see it.

718
00:30:39,564 --> 00:30:42,376
Oh, look.

719
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,894
We've been yielded.

720
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:47,411
- How great. Damn it.
- Well, that sucks.

721
00:30:47,495 --> 00:30:49,529
Kaylynn and Haley. Fair enough.

722
00:30:50,632 --> 00:30:51,858
It means that we're in last

723
00:30:51,942 --> 00:30:53,203
'cause they're desperate.

724
00:30:53,287 --> 00:30:55,031
- So sorry, guys!
- We're sorry, you guys!

725
00:30:55,115 --> 00:30:57,411
We only hate you a little!

726
00:30:57,495 --> 00:30:59,100
- We're so sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

727
00:30:59,184 --> 00:31:00,894
I'm hoping
for the best-case scenario,

728
00:31:00,978 --> 00:31:02,858
from what I've seen
happen in the past.

729
00:31:02,942 --> 00:31:04,066
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

730
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,445
All right, let's do this.

731
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:08,480
- Meat market.
- Yes. Let's eat some meat.

732
00:31:08,564 --> 00:31:10,150
Oh, there's a bunch of meat.

733
00:31:11,323 --> 00:31:12,962
It just says
"Search the meat market."

734
00:31:13,046 --> 00:31:14,942
Oh, my gosh, this place is huge.

735
00:31:15,978 --> 00:31:17,789
Oh, my gosh. Gross.

736
00:31:17,873 --> 00:31:19,203
I wish I knew
what we were looking for.

737
00:31:19,287 --> 00:31:21,927
- Oh, my gosh.
- James, keep looking.

738
00:31:22,011 --> 00:31:23,840
- I'm looking.
- Don't freak out already.

739
00:31:25,115 --> 00:31:26,873
This is hard.

740
00:31:31,115 --> 00:31:32,858
Ah. Thank you.

741
00:31:32,942 --> 00:31:34,584
I'd be really pissed

742
00:31:34,668 --> 00:31:36,789
if it has anything to do with
the skull and we don't have one.

743
00:31:36,873 --> 00:31:38,031
It's not in our stuff.

744
00:31:38,115 --> 00:31:40,376
Did y'all's hut
have a skull already in it?

745
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,962
- No.
- Where'd you get that from?

746
00:31:42,046 --> 00:31:44,126
- Over there.
- All right, that's what we're missing.

747
00:31:45,564 --> 00:31:47,031
- There it is. So the skull...
- Wow, Gary.

748
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:48,376
It's right here.

749
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,135
Luckily, Hung and Chee
offered it up.

750
00:31:50,219 --> 00:31:51,962
NFLs are right behind us

751
00:31:52,046 --> 00:31:54,239
because I gave them
the skull answer.

752
00:31:54,323 --> 00:31:55,962
Just like Phil said,
I wasn't thinking "race smart,"

753
00:31:56,046 --> 00:31:59,894
and I was just being
my naturally helpful self.

754
00:31:59,978 --> 00:32:01,962
- Are you frustrated?
- Uh...

755
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:03,894
- a-a little bit.
- Okay, Chee, you have 90 seconds

756
00:32:03,978 --> 00:32:05,789
to be, to be frustrated
and get over it.

757
00:32:05,873 --> 00:32:06,962
Okay? 'Cause you're
wasting energy.

758
00:32:07,046 --> 00:32:08,548
I'm-I'm over it.

759
00:32:08,632 --> 00:32:09,894
So... No, you don't have
to be over it immediately.

760
00:32:09,978 --> 00:32:10,858
You have 90 seconds,
so you can vent

761
00:32:10,942 --> 00:32:12,894
or you can do whatever, Chee,
but you...

762
00:32:12,978 --> 00:32:15,495
you just can't
keep on being frustrated.

763
00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:24,858
Yes. We got it.

764
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:26,376
Wow, Gary.

765
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,789
This is so frustrating.

766
00:32:28,873 --> 00:32:30,962
Are we sure it's not,
like, a clue box?

767
00:32:31,046 --> 00:32:34,184
I'm definitely afraid
of our lead evaporating.

768
00:32:38,011 --> 00:32:39,962
Last clue. Let's go.

769
00:32:40,046 --> 00:32:42,031
I'm hoping we can
do this quickly.

770
00:32:42,115 --> 00:32:43,858
This goes over here.
We're gonna try to work smart

771
00:32:43,942 --> 00:32:45,548
and fast.

772
00:32:45,632 --> 00:32:47,789
Our first, like,
adventure together,

773
00:32:47,873 --> 00:32:49,203
we hiked
in western Massachusetts

774
00:32:49,287 --> 00:32:50,894
and the whole trail
was covered in ice.

775
00:32:50,978 --> 00:32:52,031
It was covered in ice.

776
00:32:52,115 --> 00:32:53,584
It was cold.

777
00:32:53,668 --> 00:32:54,789
So we're used to this.

778
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:57,376
Feel like there are a lot
of teams that are struggling.

779
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,962
- Uh...
- That's how we make up ground.

780
00:32:59,046 --> 00:33:00,135
Yeah.

781
00:33:00,219 --> 00:33:01,789
We just are so disoriented.

782
00:33:01,873 --> 00:33:03,460
Don't get frustrated.

783
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,825
- Oh, I see it.
- Where?

784
00:33:06,909 --> 00:33:07,894
- Way up there.
- Go.

785
00:33:07,978 --> 00:33:08,858
Babe, I'm so proud of you.

786
00:33:08,942 --> 00:33:10,272
We got this.

787
00:33:10,356 --> 00:33:12,031
- There it is.
- Oh, my God.

788
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,894
"Route Info."

789
00:33:13,978 --> 00:33:16,962
"Almaty" means
"place full of apples."

790
00:33:17,046 --> 00:33:21,376
This city is believed to be home
to the world's first apple tree,

791
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,858
which dates back
20 million years.

792
00:33:24,942 --> 00:33:28,203
And every year, an apple
festival takes place here

793
00:33:28,287 --> 00:33:32,894
at First President Park, the Pit
Stop for this leg of the race.

794
00:33:32,978 --> 00:33:36,584
The last team to check in here
will be eliminated.

795
00:33:36,668 --> 00:33:39,066
Okay, so let's go. This way.

796
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,480
We need a taxi.

797
00:33:40,564 --> 00:33:42,684
So we're looking
for the meat market, right?

798
00:33:42,978 --> 00:33:44,411
- Is that it?
- Oh, that's it.

799
00:33:44,495 --> 00:33:45,962
- Where can we get a taxi?
- Is that another team's van?

800
00:33:46,046 --> 00:33:47,308
Pretend like you don't see them.

801
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:48,514
We want to get
another first place finish.

802
00:33:48,598 --> 00:33:51,308
- Thank you.
- We caught up to the boyfriends. Let's go.

803
00:33:51,392 --> 00:33:53,789
Is that yellow car
a taxi down there? No?

804
00:33:53,873 --> 00:33:56,066
Will, I don't know what to do.

805
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,323
Wow. A lot of meat.

806
00:34:03,495 --> 00:34:04,840
Go, go, go.

807
00:34:06,668 --> 00:34:09,376
Oh! Yes. Good work. Let's go.

808
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,031
I don't see any taxis.

809
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:13,031
- There's a taxi, Maddison.
- All right, let's go.

810
00:34:13,115 --> 00:34:15,031
- We need to move.
- Which way do you want to go?

811
00:34:15,115 --> 00:34:16,894
Right there, right there,
right there. Will, come on.

812
00:34:16,978 --> 00:34:18,066
Go, go, go, go.

813
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,549
We're going to
First President Park.

814
00:34:20,633 --> 00:34:22,584
- Right here? Taxi? Yeah?
- Can you drive us to, uh,

815
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:23,618
First President Park?

816
00:34:23,702 --> 00:34:25,446
- We have to go.
- We're in a race.

817
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,479
We need to mush.

818
00:34:27,563 --> 00:34:29,238
If we do a Yield and we don't
finish the challenge

819
00:34:29,322 --> 00:34:31,377
and we get eliminated,
then it's like, "Good riddance."

820
00:34:31,461 --> 00:34:33,031
Yeah,
then you just look like an idiot.

821
00:34:33,115 --> 00:34:35,100
I wonder if they're gonna
beast through it.

822
00:34:35,184 --> 00:34:38,377
Eswar and Aparna
and the blondes are still here.

823
00:34:38,461 --> 00:34:41,031
I think we're being
pretty observant,

824
00:34:41,115 --> 00:34:43,962
getting some things that
hopefully we don't have to redo.

825
00:34:44,046 --> 00:34:44,722
I think that with the yurt,

826
00:34:44,806 --> 00:34:46,203
we're doing so much better

827
00:34:46,287 --> 00:34:47,894
figuring out what
to pay attention to.

828
00:34:47,978 --> 00:34:49,943
Yeah, uh, this is right.
This is 100% right.

829
00:34:51,943 --> 00:34:53,825
I mean,
they have a head right here.

830
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:56,549
- Huh?
- Do we grab this head from them?

831
00:34:56,633 --> 00:34:59,549
Uh, let's go get the plate,
and we take the head from them.

832
00:34:59,633 --> 00:35:01,031
- You sure?
- Yeah, she literally was about

833
00:35:01,115 --> 00:35:02,410
to put it... give it to me.

834
00:35:02,494 --> 00:35:04,150
I can't believe I'd missed that.

835
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,100
Thank you. Chee, come on.

836
00:35:07,184 --> 00:35:09,100

- Okay.

837
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:11,238
I'm not sure what
we're looking for, you know?

838
00:35:11,322 --> 00:35:13,859
- Here, Hung. Up-up there.
- It's up-up on the balcony.

839
00:35:13,943 --> 00:35:17,031
- What are we looking for, Gary?
- Meat market.

840
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,238
There's meat that way.

to check in will be eliminated."

846
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,962

849
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:36,962
We think we're in first place.

850
00:35:37,046 --> 00:35:38,238
We could be wrong.
We never know.

851
00:35:38,322 --> 00:35:39,479
We can get a first place.

852
00:35:39,563 --> 00:35:41,323

897
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:30,377
I know, but, like...

898
00:37:30,461 --> 00:37:31,618
we need a head.

899
00:37:31,702 --> 00:37:34,928
Like, they have
skulls in there. Do we ask for it?

900
00:37:35,012 --> 00:37:37,203
Leo was insistent on the cow's
head being important,

901

and I then saw the woman
pulling it out of the water.

902

Like, I'm thinking

903
00:37:40,563 --> 00:37:41,549
that probably took some teams
a little bit more time.

904
00:37:41,633 --> 00:37:42,687
We can at least make up
some ground.

- Hopefully we're done soon.

for it to cook.

- Haley and I also think

912
00:38:01,115 --> 00:38:03,031
that we're second-to-the-last
team here.

913
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:05,100
- Yeah.
- We don't see Eswar and Aparna...

00:38:28,012 --> 00:38:29,307

00:39:48,115 --> 00:39:51,066
- Ah. Got it.
- There's still two clues in the box.

958
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,962
Awesome.

959
00:39:53,046 --> 00:39:54,066
- Wait, should we go right? Yeah.
- Want to start at that end?

960
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:56,230
- Let's start at this end.
- Let's start at that end.

961
00:39:56,668 --> 00:39:57,549
Okay.

962
00:39:57,633 --> 00:39:59,549
Let me see
if there's anything here.

963
00:39:59,633 --> 00:40:01,031
- Oh, dude, right there.
- Oh, perfect.

964
00:40:01,115 --> 00:40:02,479
- Oh, Kaylynn.
- Taxi?

965
00:40:02,563 --> 00:40:04,377
- That's a marked van.
- We got to go.

966
00:40:04,461 --> 00:40:05,928
I don't want to go home today.

967
00:40:06,012 --> 00:40:08,092
- We got to find a taxi.
- We got to get out of here.

968
00:40:09,012 --> 00:40:10,894
- Yeah. Go, go, go, go.
- Over here.

969
00:40:10,978 --> 00:40:12,410
- Oh, it's up there.
- Thank you!

970
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:14,377
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go.

971
00:40:14,461 --> 00:40:15,859
- Alana, here.
- Oh, you go it?

972
00:40:15,943 --> 00:40:18,377
- We need a taxi.
- Well, I'm surprised we don't see more taxis.

973
00:40:18,461 --> 00:40:19,928
We're wasting some serious time.

974
00:40:20,012 --> 00:40:21,031
What does a taxi look like here?

975
00:40:21,115 --> 00:40:23,100
- Is there a taxi sign?
- No.

976
00:40:23,184 --> 00:40:25,307
Oh, okay. Let's go.

977
00:40:25,391 --> 00:40:27,825
"...President Park and search
for Phil at your next Pit Stop.

978
00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:28,859
Warning: last team to check in
will be eliminated."

979
00:40:28,943 --> 00:40:30,031
We got to go.

980
00:40:30,115 --> 00:40:31,928
- Taxi?
- Taxi? You're a taxi? All right.

981
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,584
Uh... President Park, yeah.

982
00:40:33,668 --> 00:40:34,894
Okay, come on. Let's go.

983
00:40:34,978 --> 00:40:36,479
Thank you.

984
00:40:36,563 --> 00:40:38,894
If we're able to get
from the meat market

985
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,307
to the park before other teams,

986
00:40:40,391 --> 00:40:42,431
then speaking Russian
will have saved us.

987
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:45,272
Sir? Uh,

988
00:40:45,356 --> 00:40:46,928
is First President's Park close?

989
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:48,410
First President's Park.

990
00:40:48,494 --> 00:40:50,307
- This is it.
- Let's do some running.

991
00:40:50,391 --> 00:40:51,377
Go. Run.

992
00:40:51,461 --> 00:40:52,446
Careful, it's slippery.

993
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:53,825
How do you get in...
Oh! You okay?

994
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:54,825
- Got to go.
- Yeah, let's go!

- That's true.

- Yeah.

00:41:42,909 --> 00:41:45,446
Unfortunately, you are
the last team to arrive

Alana, this is an emotional
thing for you, right?

- Yeah.
- And it was really fun.

1020

- But I think we had a... we had a great race.
- We did.

1021

come into the race

of, uh, test or proof

that we were good together,
but I got it.

I don't think there was
a moment on this race when...

You can't take two,
you can only take one!

1040

We can!
We can take more than one!

1041
00:43:02,648 --> 00:43:03,681
It's just making

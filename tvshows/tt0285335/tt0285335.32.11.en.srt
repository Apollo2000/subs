<i>Previously, on</i>
<font color="#ffff00">"The Amazing Race"...</font>

2
00:00:10,515 --> 00:00:12,931
- All right, let's do it!
- ...five teams raced

3
00:00:13,016 --> 00:00:14,586
to Siem Reap, Cambodia.

4
00:00:14,686 --> 00:00:16,546
Just going upstream
to a temple.

5
00:00:16,648 --> 00:00:17,703
Standard Thursday.

6
00:00:17,787 --> 00:00:19,564
With only the Mine Five alliance

7
00:00:19,648 --> 00:00:22,015
left in the game,
some teams were in the dark...

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,806
It's every team for themselves.

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,323
...about a secret
alliance with a U-Turn plan.

10
00:00:26,407 --> 00:00:27,587
There's only one real alliance.

11
00:00:27,671 --> 00:00:29,288
Us, the boyfriends,

12
00:00:29,372 --> 00:00:30,495
- and Chee and Hung.
- We're all

13
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:31,770
on the same page that we need to

14
00:00:31,854 --> 00:00:33,977
get Gary and Deangelo
out of the race.

15
00:00:34,061 --> 00:00:35,806
When that plan fell apart...

16
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,668
If we U-turn Deangelo and them,
they could U-turn

17
00:00:38,752 --> 00:00:40,599
Chee-Hu or the boyfriends.

18
00:00:40,683 --> 00:00:42,599
...a new target was found...

19
00:00:42,683 --> 00:00:43,874
We're gonna
U-turn brother and sister.

20
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,220
...setting up a tense
confrontation

21
00:00:45,304 --> 00:00:46,668
at the Roadblock.

22
00:00:46,752 --> 00:00:48,943
Why would you not
use your brain to U-turn

23
00:00:49,027 --> 00:00:50,736
a team that's, like,
been ahead of you?

24
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,220
If I'd have U-turned any
other team, I'd be last.

25
00:00:52,304 --> 00:00:54,840
In the end, Riley and Maddison
won the leg...

26
00:00:54,924 --> 00:00:56,736
- You are team number one.
- Good work, man!

27
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,358
...while Eswar and Aparna
couldn't complete

28
00:00:59,442 --> 00:01:00,495
a U-Turn comeback.

29
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:01,703
I'm sorry to tell you,

30
00:01:01,787 --> 00:01:03,151
you have been eliminated
from the race.

31
00:01:03,235 --> 00:01:04,840
Coming up tonight,

32
00:01:04,924 --> 00:01:06,599
the final four
become the final three.

33
00:01:06,683 --> 00:01:08,657
- You can't let them pass us!
- Hi-o!

34
00:01:08,742 --> 00:01:09,665
Who will make it in?

35
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,542
- And who will be eliminated...
- Come on, Gary.

36
00:01:11,626 --> 00:01:12,358
...next?

37
00:01:12,442 --> 00:01:13,703
Let's go, alliance!

38
00:01:13,787 --> 00:01:16,151
Shh! Secret.

39
00:01:21,854 --> 00:01:24,460
After
finishing first in Cambodia,

40
00:01:24,544 --> 00:01:27,633
Riley and Maddison won a trip
from Travelocity

41
00:01:27,717 --> 00:01:30,046
- to Norway.
- Holy moly.

42
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,537
We're going to Bergen, Norway.

43
00:01:31,622 --> 00:01:33,426
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah! Five nights!

44
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,840
This is legit.

45
00:01:34,924 --> 00:01:36,736
Our beards are gonna fit
right in.

46
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,529
Wow. This is the hotel?

47
00:01:38,613 --> 00:01:40,496
- Wow, look at that.
- Look at this place.

48
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,323
We're gonna be living it up.

49
00:01:42,407 --> 00:01:44,874
- Nice. We're stoked.
- Yes!

50
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:48,013
- Where we going?
- "Fly to Manila in the Philippines."

51
00:01:48,097 --> 00:01:50,391
Riley and Maddison
will be the first

52
00:01:50,475 --> 00:01:53,520
of the final four teams
to fly to Manila,

53
00:01:53,605 --> 00:01:55,703
the capital city
of the Philippines,

54
00:01:55,787 --> 00:01:58,288
one of the first countries
to adopt texting,

55
00:01:58,372 --> 00:02:01,668
and now known as the texting
capital of the world.

56
00:02:01,752 --> 00:02:05,219
Teams must find me here,
downtown,

57
00:02:05,303 --> 00:02:07,668
at Lapu Lapu Circle.

58
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,151
- Let's do it.
- All right.

59
00:02:09,235 --> 00:02:10,634
Final four feels real good.

60
00:02:10,718 --> 00:02:12,703
We've won two legs in a row.

61
00:02:12,787 --> 00:02:14,518
So, I guess you'd say
we're-we're peaking,

62
00:02:14,603 --> 00:02:15,874
but I don't want to jinx it.

63
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:17,668
Kind of a strange clue, though,

64
00:02:17,752 --> 00:02:19,874
because it says you'll find,
like, a marked jeep

65
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,046
- that will take you to Phil.
- Right.

66
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,599
Normally you only
see Phil at the end,

67
00:02:23,683 --> 00:02:24,715
at the Pit Stop, and this time,

68
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:26,800
we're seeing him almost
at the Pit Start.

69
00:02:26,885 --> 00:02:28,253
Something strange
is gonna happen.

70
00:02:28,337 --> 00:02:29,978
The Philippines!

71
00:02:30,062 --> 00:02:32,909
We love the Philippines!
Mabuhay. Let's go.

72
00:02:32,993 --> 00:02:35,289
Lapu Lapu Circle, here we come.

73
00:02:35,373 --> 00:02:37,358
To make the final three would be

74
00:02:37,442 --> 00:02:38,978
a dream come true.

75
00:02:39,062 --> 00:02:40,736
To get to the very end would be

76
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,151
amazing.

77
00:02:42,235 --> 00:02:43,496
Unintended.

78
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,978
It would be great if Gary
and Deangelo

79
00:02:46,062 --> 00:02:49,253
have a big fall-out today,
and get eliminated.

80
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:51,909
We love our alliance
with Hung and Chee and the beards.

81
00:02:51,993 --> 00:02:54,437
But at this point, we really
need to focus on Will and James.

82
00:02:54,522 --> 00:02:56,852
As long as Will and James
get to the final three,

83
00:02:56,937 --> 00:02:58,184
that's all we care about.

84
00:02:58,268 --> 00:02:59,496
- All right, let's go.
- Let's go.

85
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,840
It would be just a huge sense

86
00:03:01,924 --> 00:03:03,806
of satisfaction to make it
to the final leg.

87
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,668
Hung and I want to do this
to be good role models

88
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,013
for our daughters, you know,

89
00:03:07,097 --> 00:03:09,634
and show them what, you know,
grit and determination

90
00:03:09,718 --> 00:03:10,285
looks like.

91
00:03:10,369 --> 00:03:12,151
Never been
to the Philippines before.

92
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:14,678
Um, my best friend is
half Filipino,

93
00:03:14,763 --> 00:03:16,905
so hopefully
this is a good sign.

94
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,006
All right, let's go.

95
00:03:18,091 --> 00:03:19,506
Winning's our nature.
It's what

96
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:21,398
we're taught to do growing up,
it's what we were taught

97
00:03:21,482 --> 00:03:24,184
when we're playing. We don't
want participation trophies.

98
00:03:24,268 --> 00:03:25,564
We only want to win.
If we don't win,

99
00:03:25,648 --> 00:03:26,703
then we're not satisfied.

100
00:03:26,787 --> 00:03:28,703
At this point,
no one's helping anyone,

101
00:03:28,787 --> 00:03:31,770
because it could cost you
a trip into the...

102
00:03:31,854 --> 00:03:32,770
The final three.

103
00:03:32,854 --> 00:03:34,770
...the final three.

104
00:03:34,854 --> 00:03:36,184
Hey, what's up, guys?

105
00:03:36,268 --> 00:03:38,046
Okay, I see Will
and James and beard brothers.

106
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,840
Yay!

107
00:03:39,924 --> 00:03:41,668
Guys, the alliance is complete.

108
00:03:41,752 --> 00:03:43,184
Yeah, this feels good.

109
00:03:43,268 --> 00:03:45,081
Hopefully, there'll be
a dance challenge

110
00:03:45,165 --> 00:03:47,633
or something Deangelo and Gary
can't do.

111
00:03:47,717 --> 00:03:50,874
Hopefully they'll go.

112
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,165
- There they are.
- Yeah.

113
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:55,116
- Can we, uh...?
- Let's check in now.

114
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,323
Oh, let's check in.
Go ahead, guys.

115
00:03:56,407 --> 00:03:57,703
Hey, guys.

116
00:03:57,787 --> 00:03:59,323
- Hello.
- Hello.

117
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:02,116
We are on our
way to the Philippines.

118
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,703
And we're all on one flight.

119
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:06,151
Our only goal now is
to get to the final three.

120
00:04:06,235 --> 00:04:07,771
Gonna be another team out there,

121
00:04:07,855 --> 00:04:10,219
whether it's the beard bros
or the boyfriends

122
00:04:10,303 --> 00:04:12,496
or Chee-Hu, that are going home.

123
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,840
Boarding our flight to Manila!

124
00:04:14,924 --> 00:04:16,840
- Final four, baby.
- What he said.

125
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,959
It's about to be
The Thrilla in Manila, Part 2.

Lapu Lapu Circle.

128
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:43,426
Right there, he's right there.

129
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,875
Oh, I see him with his hat.

130
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,013
It's extremely weird to see Phil

131
00:04:48,097 --> 00:04:49,529
at the beginning of a leg.

132
00:04:49,613 --> 00:04:50,840
Hi, everybody.

133
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:52,370
We knew that something different

134
00:04:52,455 --> 00:04:53,323
was gonna happen.

135
00:04:53,407 --> 00:04:55,426
And everybody was on pins
and needles.

136
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,565
Welcome to downtown Manila,

137
00:04:58,649 --> 00:04:59,943
the most densely populated

138
00:05:00,027 --> 00:05:02,013
city center in the world.

139
00:05:02,097 --> 00:05:04,667
Now, you're probably wondering
why I've got you here.

140
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:07,426
That's because,
for the first time ever,

141
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,840
you're about to take part
in a city sprint.

142
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:14,529
You are gonna be racing
around Manila,

143
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:17,150
through all this dense,
crazy traffic,

144
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,667
as fast as you can.

145
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:19,703
Holy smokes.

146
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:21,392
There are no Roadblocks

147
00:05:21,476 --> 00:05:22,806
and no Detours.

148
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,770
You'll do every challenge
as a team and speed

149
00:05:25,854 --> 00:05:28,150
matters the most.
You're gonna race all around

150
00:05:28,234 --> 00:05:30,150
the city and then guess where
you're coming back to.

151
00:05:30,234 --> 00:05:31,219
- Here.
- Right here.

152
00:05:31,303 --> 00:05:33,219
Right here.
This is the start

153
00:05:33,303 --> 00:05:35,289
of this leg of the race
and it's also the Pit Stop

154
00:05:35,373 --> 00:05:36,668
for this leg of the race.

155
00:05:36,752 --> 00:05:39,599
So, I know that there's
been some alliances.

156
00:05:39,683 --> 00:05:41,565
I know that, throughout
the race, you've all helped

157
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:44,184
each other out, but if I could
give you any advice,

158
00:05:44,268 --> 00:05:46,909
think very carefully about
helping out another team,

159
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:49,289
because this is all or nothing
for all of you.

160
00:05:49,373 --> 00:05:52,703
If you want to be in
that final three,

161
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:54,013
you got to do what you can
to stay in it.

162
00:05:54,097 --> 00:05:55,875
Is everybody ready to race?

163
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,875
- Yeah!
- Yes!

164
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,529
All right, now your first clue

165
00:05:58,613 --> 00:06:00,253
is inside one of
the marked jeepneys

166
00:06:00,337 --> 00:06:02,529
which is close by.

167
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:04,046
When I give you the word,

168
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,046
you can run to that
marked jeepney,

169
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,703
grab your clue, read it,

170
00:06:08,787 --> 00:06:11,150
and start your sprint
around Manila.

171
00:06:11,234 --> 00:06:12,703
Good luck.

172
00:06:12,787 --> 00:06:14,441
Travel safe.

173
00:06:16,787 --> 00:06:17,770
- Run, run.
- Let's get it, let's go.

174
00:06:17,854 --> 00:06:18,840
Come on, Chee.
Chee, come on.

175
00:06:18,924 --> 00:06:20,116
- Come on, babe.
- Yo, I don't know

176
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,667
- if it's this way.
- Hello. Hi!

177
00:06:21,751 --> 00:06:22,770
- Keep running.
- There they are.

178
00:06:22,854 --> 00:06:24,806
Will, Will, come here!
Right here.

179
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,426
- Just get in one. Right here.
- Go, baby.

180
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,770
Right there, to the left.

181
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:28,875
Do you see it, Chee?

182
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,529
Here we go.

183
00:06:30,613 --> 00:06:33,116
"Solve this riddle to find
the marked clue giver."

184
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,392
"But keep your eyes peeled while
you're on the road."

185
00:06:35,476 --> 00:06:36,806
"Red means stop,
green means go."

186
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,736
"When it comes to traffic,
I make it flow."

187
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,599
"Hold out your hand
to grab your clue.

188
00:06:40,683 --> 00:06:42,875
Then you'll find out
what's waiting for you."

189
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,668
The navigation company Waze

190
00:06:44,752 --> 00:06:47,529
once called this the worst
traffic on Earth.

191
00:06:48,854 --> 00:06:52,599
The perfect recipe
for road rage.

192
00:06:52,683 --> 00:06:56,392
Thankfully, Romero Hinojas
has come to the rescue,

193
00:06:56,476 --> 00:06:59,565
by putting a smile
on everyone's faces

194
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:01,909
with entertaining moves
like these.

195
00:07:01,993 --> 00:07:05,323
Teams need to find him,
grab a clue,

196
00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:06,943
and then keep on racing.

197
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:09,356
- Get ready to have your hand out.
- Yes.

198
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:12,219
The marked
jeepney knew where to go.

199
00:07:12,303 --> 00:07:13,667
We just need to keep
our eyes open.

200
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:17,392
"Hold out your hand
and grab your clue."

201
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:20,219
"Red means stop, green means go.

202
00:07:20,303 --> 00:07:21,633
When it comes to traffic,
I make it flow."

203
00:07:21,717 --> 00:07:24,253
So it's either a traffic light
or a policeman.

204
00:07:24,337 --> 00:07:26,840
Damn, we are stuck
in some traffic.

205
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:28,875
In Manila, there is an insane
amount of traffic,

206
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,977
which is alarming because

207
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:32,046
you know that that's

208
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,323
gonna play a part in the race.

209
00:07:33,407 --> 00:07:35,082
Traffic going in
every single direction,

210
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,357
multiple ways.

211
00:07:36,441 --> 00:07:38,441
Go, go, go!

212
00:07:40,683 --> 00:07:44,046
- What the hell?
- Move!

213
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,770
Shoot, we just got passed up
by everybody.

214
00:07:45,854 --> 00:07:48,770
Go! Go to the side, please!

215
00:07:48,854 --> 00:07:50,824
You got to stick
your arm out to get the clue.

216
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:52,668
- Yeah, I know, I saw that.
- So get ready.

217
00:07:52,752 --> 00:07:54,013
Get your arm ready.

218
00:07:54,097 --> 00:07:55,184
'Cause it could be on your side.

219
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:56,323
We're not even at a light.

220
00:07:56,407 --> 00:07:57,565
There's a light right here.

221
00:07:57,649 --> 00:07:59,184
I'm just saying,
you got to look.

222
00:07:59,268 --> 00:08:01,703
I'm just gonna have my arm out
the whole time.

223
00:08:01,787 --> 00:08:03,392
If you pass the clue,
you're in trouble.

224
00:08:03,476 --> 00:08:04,909
Definitely one of those things
where it helps

225
00:08:04,993 --> 00:08:06,770
to be with the pack and not

226
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:07,840
too far ahead.

227
00:08:07,924 --> 00:08:09,323
- It's cutthroat now.
- Yeah.

228
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,253
Riley, is this the guy?

229
00:08:14,337 --> 00:08:15,529
Did you see the traffic cop

230
00:08:15,613 --> 00:08:17,323
that we need to
get the clue from?

231
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,770
- Yeah.
- Oh, here, here, here! Riley, Riley, Riley!

232
00:08:18,854 --> 00:08:21,174
On your side. Yo! Hey!
Hey, hey, hey. Here! Here!

233
00:08:21,274 --> 00:08:22,360
Come here!

234
00:08:22,445 --> 00:08:23,424
Thank you.

235
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:24,736
- We crushed it.
- Let's do this.

236
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,599
"Tell your driver to take you
to Mall of Asia."

237
00:08:28,683 --> 00:08:29,736
- Mall of Asia!
- Hey!

238
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,046
- Right there.
- Hey!

239
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,323
- Right there, right there.
- Oh, right here. Oh!

240
00:08:32,407 --> 00:08:33,805
Sir, sir!

241
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:36,012
Sir, over here!

242
00:08:36,096 --> 00:08:37,703
Hey! Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

243
00:08:37,787 --> 00:08:39,770
Sweet. Thank you.

244
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:41,496
- We're going to Mall of Asia.
- Sir, sir!

245
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,391
Sir, sir!

246
00:08:43,475 --> 00:08:44,634
- Sir, sir, sir!
- Sir!

247
00:08:44,718 --> 00:08:46,220
It was definitely
morning traffic.

248
00:08:46,304 --> 00:08:48,668
When we eventually found
the police officer,

249
00:08:48,752 --> 00:08:51,496
our jeepney turned sharply,
so we couldn't get the clue.

250
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,461
And so,
we had to circle back around.

251
00:08:53,545 --> 00:08:55,703
Do we have to circle
back around?

252
00:08:55,787 --> 00:08:57,220
Can we go back?

253
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,116
- Slow it down. Slow, slow, slow.
- Slow, slow.

254
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,634
- Slow, slow, slow.
- Slow, slow, slow.

255
00:09:00,718 --> 00:09:02,082
- Put your hand out, Will.
- Slow, slow, slow.

256
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,668
The traffic was a nightmare.

257
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,184
It's kind of a crapshoot
at that point.

258
00:09:06,268 --> 00:09:07,461
It's really luck of the draw.

259
00:09:07,545 --> 00:09:09,529
No, no, no, no, no, no!

260
00:09:09,613 --> 00:09:10,770
Come back,
come back. Come here, sir!

261
00:09:10,854 --> 00:09:12,805
- Sir! Sir! Sir!
- Sir! Sir!

262
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:13,839
Come here, please!

263
00:09:13,923 --> 00:09:16,668
Are you joking me?

264
00:09:16,752 --> 00:09:18,943
Hung and Chee didn't get theirs,
either.

265
00:09:19,027 --> 00:09:20,564
Did James and Will get it,
or did they miss it?

266
00:09:20,648 --> 00:09:23,289
Looks like they didn't get it.
They've got to circle back, too.

267
00:09:23,373 --> 00:09:25,496
That's so annoying.

268
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,150
Go back to that intersection!

269
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,613
- That's so messed up!
- Turn around!

270
00:09:35,234 --> 00:09:36,496
- That is ridiculous.
- I had my hand out.

271
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,854
Your hand was out!

272
00:09:40,234 --> 00:09:42,012
Yes, James! Be quiet.

273
00:09:42,096 --> 00:09:43,357
Can we go back?

274
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:45,357
Go back to that intersection,
please!

275
00:09:45,441 --> 00:09:47,787
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

276
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,391
- Hung and Chee are behind us.
- Thank God.

277
00:09:52,475 --> 00:09:53,839
- Slow it down. Slow.
- Slow, slow.

278
00:09:53,923 --> 00:09:55,529
- Slow, slow, slow.
- Slow, slow, slow, slow.

279
00:09:55,613 --> 00:09:57,598
- Put your hand out, Will.
- Slow, slow, slow, slow.

280
00:09:57,682 --> 00:09:59,736
I got it.

281
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,047
I got it, I got it.

282
00:10:01,131 --> 00:10:03,254
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

283
00:10:03,338 --> 00:10:05,668
- Come on, come on.
- Okay, we're approaching, okay, Hung?

284
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:07,875
Yes. Do you see him?

285
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:10,427
I don't see him.

286
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:12,634
He's on the right!

287
00:10:12,718 --> 00:10:14,082
On my side, Hung.
On my side. Get on my side.

288
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,770
Get on my side. Let's go.

289
00:10:15,854 --> 00:10:18,047
Hello, hello, hello, hello!

290
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:20,082
- Hello.
- Ah!

291
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,391
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

292
00:10:21,475 --> 00:10:23,770
Mall of Asia.

293
00:10:23,854 --> 00:10:25,770
- Yeah? Over there.
- Yeah, this is good.

294
00:10:25,854 --> 00:10:27,289
Let's do this!

295
00:10:27,373 --> 00:10:28,736
- That way.
- All right, let's go.

296
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,496
- Let's go, Riley.
- Whew. -

297
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,909
"Run a race at a fast pace.

298
00:10:31,993 --> 00:10:34,391
In high-heeled pumps,
don't fall on your face."

299
00:10:34,475 --> 00:10:39,012
Marikina is home to
a thriving shoe-making industry,

300
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,875
as well as the world's
largest pair of shoes,

301
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:45,289
earning the nickname "The Shoe
Capital of the Philippines."

302
00:10:45,373 --> 00:10:47,391
It's also home to
an annual running race

303
00:10:47,475 --> 00:10:49,391
unlike any other on the planet.

304
00:10:50,993 --> 00:10:55,012
It's a great way to
test the durability of these

305
00:10:55,096 --> 00:10:56,770
high-heeled pumps.
Let's hope

306
00:10:56,854 --> 00:10:59,323
no one breaks an ankle
as they try to complete

307
00:10:59,407 --> 00:11:02,770
the course
in these stylish stilettos.

308
00:11:02,854 --> 00:11:03,875
"Make your way to
the starting line.

309
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,150
"When signaled, run

310
00:11:05,234 --> 00:11:06,461
the marked course
and cross the finish line."

311
00:11:06,545 --> 00:11:07,805
Oh, my God, you're kidding me.

312
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:09,461
- Let's put our shoes on.
- Oh, geez.

313
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:11,461
I don't want to sprain my ankle
in these things.

314
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,496
We're putting on
these beautiful high heels.

315
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,184
Good thing I'm used to wearing
these every Friday night.

316
00:11:16,268 --> 00:11:17,529
This is the bay.

317
00:11:17,613 --> 00:11:19,977
So it should be on this
somewhere.

318
00:11:21,096 --> 00:11:22,220
Did they beat us here?

319
00:11:22,304 --> 00:11:24,460
Feeling real sexy.

320
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:27,085
Ridiculous. Oh, no, no, no.

321
00:11:27,201 --> 00:11:29,116
- They-they just showed up.
- Let's do it.

322
00:11:29,201 --> 00:11:30,491
Okay, let's go. Ready?

323
00:11:30,576 --> 00:11:32,216
- Run on your toes. Oh, God.
- Yeah, toes.

324
00:11:33,718 --> 00:11:36,047
We had to do a 500-meter dash

325
00:11:36,131 --> 00:11:37,529
with other people
wearing high heels.

326
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,427
The running was less
than comfortable.

327
00:11:40,511 --> 00:11:41,839
We had to run on our tippy toes
the whole time.

328
00:11:41,923 --> 00:11:43,184
Well, Riley's like,

329
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:45,410
"Yo, run on your toes."
I was like,

330
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:47,831
- "You can't."
- This is absurd.

331
00:11:48,862 --> 00:11:50,875
"Run a race at a fast pace.
In high-heeled pumps."

332
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,082
Hell no.

333
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,391
I got to run in high heels.

334
00:11:54,475 --> 00:11:55,875
This is a new one for me.

335
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:57,391
It's a new one for both of us.

336
00:11:57,514 --> 00:11:59,212
Be careful, yeah?

337
00:11:59,297 --> 00:12:00,720
I just really didn't
want to get hurt,

338
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:01,867
because I got, you know,

339
00:12:01,952 --> 00:12:02,909
nice, skinny, fragile ankles.

340
00:12:02,993 --> 00:12:04,736
And one little tweak,

341
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,529
and that's...
That's game over for us.

342
00:12:06,613 --> 00:12:08,977
You know what? I'm-a have fun.

343
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,254
The zipper's not going up.

344
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:11,668
Just keep breathing.

345
00:12:11,752 --> 00:12:13,254
Let's go, baby.

346
00:12:13,338 --> 00:12:15,529
Come on!

347
00:12:15,613 --> 00:12:17,116
I have ran my share of 40s.

348
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,254
I've never ran 'em
in heels, though.

349
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,703
- It's ridiculous.
- This is awful, bro.

350
00:12:20,787 --> 00:12:22,770
Come on. You ready?

351
00:12:24,338 --> 00:12:26,289
Come on, Gary, come on.

352
00:12:26,373 --> 00:12:28,220
I'm not used to this, man.

353
00:12:28,304 --> 00:12:29,461
Fight through the pain.

354
00:12:29,545 --> 00:12:31,736
Let's go.

355
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,668
Oh, this sucks.

356
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,736
Ow.

357
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,461
Looking good, guys.

358
00:12:37,545 --> 00:12:39,598
- This sucks so bad.
- Yeah.

359
00:12:39,682 --> 00:12:41,634
- Come on, Gary.
- I'm coming.

360
00:12:41,718 --> 00:12:43,736
I want to beat this guy.

361
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,852
- This is it?
- They've already started, James.

362
00:12:45,937 --> 00:12:47,407
Holy smokes.

363
00:12:47,492 --> 00:12:50,196
Oh, this sucks bad.

364
00:12:50,281 --> 00:12:52,258
Gary and Deangelo
running in high heels,

365
00:12:52,343 --> 00:12:53,946
that's something I never thought

366
00:12:54,031 --> 00:12:55,289
I would ever see in my lifetime.

367
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:57,598
Oh, my God, it was so good.

368
00:12:57,682 --> 00:12:59,220
Gary, you're killing me, bro.

369
00:12:59,304 --> 00:13:03,047
- I'm running!
- Oh, my God, we get to walk in heels.

370
00:13:03,131 --> 00:13:04,564
Thank you.

371
00:13:04,648 --> 00:13:06,323
Go, go, go!

372
00:13:06,407 --> 00:13:08,736
Yeah, keep going straight, Hung,
keep going straight.

373
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,752
Hold on. Wait for me.

374
00:13:13,304 --> 00:13:15,736
Yay!

375
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,679
- Nice.
- All right.

376
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:19,296
I don't know how women
wear heels,

377
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,717
let alone run in them.

378
00:13:20,802 --> 00:13:22,046
"Make your way to Binondo.

379
00:13:22,131 --> 00:13:23,476
"Search the streets for lions.

380
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:25,308
"Reach into their bite,
they won't put up a fight.

381
00:13:25,392 --> 00:13:27,232
You'll get your next clue
if you're all right."

382
00:13:27,718 --> 00:13:29,909
This is an entrance to Binondo,

383
00:13:29,993 --> 00:13:31,805
the oldest Chinatown
in the world.

384
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:35,805
It's customary for businesses
to invite dancing lions

385
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:37,977
like this in for a visit,

386
00:13:38,061 --> 00:13:40,703
with the hope of
bringing them good luck

387
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:42,496
and prosperity.

388
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,220
Teams must now search among
the lions on these congested streets

389
00:13:46,304 --> 00:13:48,770
and find one with a clue
in its mouth.

390
00:13:48,854 --> 00:13:51,391
"Enter Binondo
through the Arch of Goodwill."

391
00:13:51,475 --> 00:13:52,391
Let's get a taxi, Riley.

392
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:54,564
Oh, my God.

393
00:13:54,648 --> 00:13:56,703
I am so uncomfortable.
I got to walk.

394
00:13:56,787 --> 00:13:58,564
Come on,
Gary. We're almost there, bro.

395
00:13:58,648 --> 00:14:02,289
- Yes!
- Running in heels is up our alley.

396
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:04,703
- We can do this in our sleep.
- I own a pair of high heels.

397
00:14:04,787 --> 00:14:06,357
Who owns a pair of heels? I do.

398
00:14:06,441 --> 00:14:07,805
But mine are six inches.

399
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,564
So these were, like,
kitten heels.

400
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,208
Like, little two-inch
little baby heels.

401
00:14:12,613 --> 00:14:13,909
This is funny.

402
00:14:13,993 --> 00:14:15,720
I'd never run
in high heels before,

403
00:14:15,805 --> 00:14:17,564
so I was a little bit antsy
about that.

404
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,977
You've never run in high heels?

405
00:14:19,061 --> 00:14:20,529
I've "walked" around in heels,

406
00:14:20,613 --> 00:14:22,909
- but I'd never ran in heels.
- Okay.

407
00:14:22,993 --> 00:14:24,047
- Okay, ready, Hung?
- Yeah.

408
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:26,150
All right. Are you ready?

409
00:14:26,234 --> 00:14:28,770
- Ready.
- Go!

410
00:14:28,854 --> 00:14:30,736
- Ready?
- Yeah!

411
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,012
- Go! -
- Go.

412
00:14:34,096 --> 00:14:36,736
- Babe, be careful.
- Come on, babe! We got it.

413
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,461
- Go, Chee, just go.
- I'm going as fast as I can.

414
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,047
- Okay.
- Okay.

415
00:14:40,131 --> 00:14:43,012
We actually caught up
with Hung and Chee

416
00:14:43,096 --> 00:14:43,977
while running in the heels.

417
00:14:44,061 --> 00:14:45,598
Oh, my God.

418
00:14:45,682 --> 00:14:46,703
Come on, Will.

419
00:14:46,787 --> 00:14:47,909
And more importantly,

420
00:14:47,993 --> 00:14:50,668
- we looked good while doing it.
- Yeah.

421
00:14:50,752 --> 00:14:52,770
- Look at James.
- This is so fun.

422
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,357
It's a little bit painful.

423
00:14:56,889 --> 00:14:57,977
Almost there, Hung.

424
00:14:58,061 --> 00:14:59,357
Yes!

425
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:01,736
Come on, babe.

426
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,047
Oh! Babe, you are awesome.

427
00:15:05,131 --> 00:15:07,289
- Good job, Chee.
- Yeah.

428
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:10,564
I think we're in first,
but by nothing.

429
00:15:10,648 --> 00:15:13,875
The traffic is so
incredibly difficult

430
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:15,702
that everyone has time
to catch up.

431
00:15:15,787 --> 00:15:17,553
We're looking
for the Arch of Goodwill.

432
00:15:17,671 --> 00:15:18,671
We're in a race.

433
00:15:19,613 --> 00:15:20,889
Sweet.

434
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,391
- Oh, there's one right there.
- Where?

435
00:15:25,475 --> 00:15:28,015
There's one right there.
The-the lions right there.

436
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,100
Ah, is that a lion?
Can you get your hand in there?

437
00:15:30,357 --> 00:15:32,506
- Nothing.
- There's nothing in there.

438
00:15:32,787 --> 00:15:34,047
It could be these dragons
right here, D.

439
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:36,736
No, it's not in there. Are they
dragons or are they lions?

440
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,461
Lions. Is this a lion?

441
00:15:39,545 --> 00:15:41,012
- I don't know...
- Should I put it in his mouth?

442
00:15:41,096 --> 00:15:42,839
- Put it in his mouth?
- Go ahead.

443
00:15:42,923 --> 00:15:44,959
Stick your hand in there.

444
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:48,427
- Nah, you can't.
- Hey, hey, hey. This is what they do.

445
00:15:48,511 --> 00:15:50,564
- Oh.
- He's trying to, like, see.

446
00:15:50,648 --> 00:15:52,441
We'll just see.

447
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:56,220
No?

448
00:15:56,304 --> 00:15:58,012
All right, let's go.
Come on, go, go, go, go.

449
00:15:58,096 --> 00:15:59,529
- Come on, Gary!
- Let's go, let's go.

450
00:15:59,613 --> 00:16:01,323
Come on, let's go.

451
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:03,047
We got to hurry up,
we got to hurry up.

452
00:16:03,131 --> 00:16:04,357
- See.
- You're taking your time.

453
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:05,770
- Okay.
- Hurry up.

454
00:16:05,854 --> 00:16:07,427
- Come on, D. Hurry up.
- Huh?

455
00:16:07,511 --> 00:16:09,545
- Hurry up!
- I'm hurrying.

456
00:16:10,854 --> 00:16:12,529
- Oh. No.
- No. Okay.

457
00:16:12,613 --> 00:16:14,254
Is that the Arch of Goodwill? Yes,
it is.

458
00:16:14,338 --> 00:16:16,289
- All right.
- We're gonna get out right here.

459
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:18,496
This might be it.

460
00:16:23,854 --> 00:16:25,012
- Got it.
- That it?

461
00:16:25,096 --> 00:16:27,323
- This is it?
- Come on, come on, come on.

462
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:28,943
"To the Central Post Office.
On foot you must go."

463
00:16:29,027 --> 00:16:32,082
Central Post Office. Come on,
Gary.

464
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,220
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, guys.

465
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:34,564
Hey.

466
00:16:34,648 --> 00:16:35,496
Will, there's a lion.

467
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,184
Hello, lion.

468
00:16:37,268 --> 00:16:39,529
- Come on, Will.
- Maybe if I put my hand

469
00:16:39,613 --> 00:16:41,220
- in the mouth. No?
- Come on, Will.

470
00:16:41,304 --> 00:16:43,082
What the hell is going on?

471
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,875
That one doesn't have one.

472
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,061
Okay.

473
00:16:51,407 --> 00:16:55,564
Do you have a clue for us?
Do you have a clue for us?

474
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:58,116
- What the hell?
- Do you have a clue?

475
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,909
No.

476
00:16:59,993 --> 00:17:01,875
No?

477
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:03,529
Will, there's another one
down here.

478
00:17:03,613 --> 00:17:04,908
Yes!

479
00:17:04,992 --> 00:17:06,304
There it is!

480
00:17:09,406 --> 00:17:11,703
Yay! Go, go.

481
00:17:11,787 --> 00:17:13,184
Do we want to ask someone?

482
00:17:13,268 --> 00:17:14,770
The archway, Riley.

483
00:17:14,854 --> 00:17:16,770
Oh, there-there's Deangelo
and them.

484
00:17:16,854 --> 00:17:18,322
- Let's go, Gary.
- Let's go the other way.

485
00:17:18,406 --> 00:17:20,116
Let's keep going down.

486
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,598
- Want to keep running down?
- Sure. I don't know what else to do.

487
00:17:22,682 --> 00:17:24,770
- Arch of Goodwill? Right here?
- This? Oh.

488
00:17:24,854 --> 00:17:26,253
Okay.

489
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,634
So where are the lions?

490
00:17:27,718 --> 00:17:29,200
David, where are the lions?

491
00:17:31,062 --> 00:17:32,461
That's the only arch?

492
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:35,461
You don't know
where the lions are?

493
00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:37,322
Should we, uh,
stop and get out now?

494
00:17:37,406 --> 00:17:39,289
Yeah. Thank you.

495
00:17:39,373 --> 00:17:41,529
Okay, let's go, let's go.

496
00:17:41,613 --> 00:17:42,806
Let's go.

497
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,667
Do you know where
the Chinese lions are?

498
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:46,322
Chinese lion statues?

499
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:47,426
No?

500
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,839
Where are the lions?

501
00:17:48,923 --> 00:17:50,392
Well, maybe it's this fountain.

502
00:17:50,476 --> 00:17:52,184
- That way?
- Okay, no-no lions.

503
00:17:52,268 --> 00:17:53,392
Come on.

504
00:17:53,476 --> 00:17:55,081
No? No?

505
00:17:55,165 --> 00:17:58,012
Let's keep going, Riley.
We're going the right direction.

506
00:17:58,096 --> 00:17:59,461
Right here.
Riley, here we go.

507
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,770
Go. Oh.

508
00:18:01,854 --> 00:18:02,854
Yeah!

509
00:18:06,062 --> 00:18:07,737
It's a bit of a crapshoot.

510
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:10,047
I don't, I don't see anything.

511
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,806
I don't see any lion heads
over there.

512
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,012
- Maybe it's on the bridge?
- Lions?

513
00:18:14,096 --> 00:18:15,579
- We need help.
- Can't find one.

514
00:18:17,854 --> 00:18:19,634
- Where?
- To the Arch of Goodwill.

515
00:18:19,718 --> 00:18:21,634
No, Chee! No.

516
00:18:27,235 --> 00:18:28,854
Look that way, Chee.

517
00:18:30,096 --> 00:18:32,012
I don't see any lion heads
over there.

518
00:18:32,096 --> 00:18:34,253
We're in trouble. We're behind.

519
00:18:34,337 --> 00:18:36,839
- Come on. Okay.
- Want me to ask these police officers?

520
00:18:36,923 --> 00:18:40,151
Hello. We're looking for
a statue of the Chinese lions.

521
00:18:40,235 --> 00:18:41,253
Dragon lions?

522
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:42,634
Like, like, they look like this.

523
00:18:42,718 --> 00:18:43,943
Yeah.

524
00:18:44,027 --> 00:18:45,667
Wh-Where?

525
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:47,047
Oh, there's no here?

526
00:18:47,131 --> 00:18:48,529
Anywhere close by?

527
00:18:48,613 --> 00:18:49,875
Lion statues?

528
00:18:51,787 --> 00:18:53,289
- I'm sorry. This way?
- This way?

529
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:55,081
- Okay.
- Thank you. Let's go. Go, go.

530
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:57,565
This looks like
this could be a post office.

531
00:18:57,649 --> 00:18:59,184
Oh, there go the box
right there.

532
00:18:59,268 --> 00:19:00,220
I see it.

533
00:19:04,787 --> 00:19:06,461
"Go into the square,
you'll find horses there.

534
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,289
Prepare their feed,
it's just what they need."

535
00:19:08,373 --> 00:19:10,875
This is Manila Central
Post Office,

536
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:13,598
where teams must find
these kalesas,

537
00:19:13,682 --> 00:19:16,220
horse-drawn carriages
that were introduced

538
00:19:16,304 --> 00:19:20,220
by Spanish colonizers
in the 18th century.

539
00:19:20,304 --> 00:19:21,770
After choosing a horse,

540
00:19:21,854 --> 00:19:23,667
teams must feed it.

541
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:25,598
They'll need to search
the grounds for the necessary

542
00:19:25,682 --> 00:19:28,184
ingredients
and then mix them together.

543
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:30,634
Once they've served it up,

544
00:19:30,718 --> 00:19:32,875
they'll get a clue.

545
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:34,279
Square right here,
straight ahead.

546
00:19:35,165 --> 00:19:36,392
Come on, let's go!

547
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:37,634
Right here?

548
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,151
"Use the bucket located
on the carriage."

549
00:19:39,235 --> 00:19:40,392
Okay.

550
00:19:40,476 --> 00:19:42,565
So we got to find vendors

551
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:44,047
that have our ingredients,

552
00:19:44,131 --> 00:19:45,529
around this plaza.

553
00:19:45,613 --> 00:19:46,806
Then we have to mix them later.

554
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,253
- You see anything?
- I don't know.

555
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:49,253
That's one right there. Come on.

556
00:19:49,337 --> 00:19:50,737
Come on. Gary, right here.

557
00:19:50,821 --> 00:19:52,426
- First one.
- Thank you!

558
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,529
We're in first place, but trying
to find the other ones now.

559
00:19:54,613 --> 00:19:55,839
We got to find two more.

560
00:19:55,923 --> 00:19:57,737
"Route Info." Holy crap. More.

561
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,839
"Choose a marked horse
and carriage."

562
00:19:59,923 --> 00:20:01,116
- Go, go, go.
- Will, just pick this one.

563
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,875
"Use the provided bucket located
in the carriage."

564
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:05,151
Right here.

565
00:20:05,235 --> 00:20:07,770
- That looks like poop.
- Oh.

566
00:20:07,854 --> 00:20:09,253
The bucket underneath.

567
00:20:09,337 --> 00:20:10,777
- There you go.
- Okay, go. That way.

568
00:20:14,441 --> 00:20:16,392
Here!

569
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:18,426
- Pour it in here?
- This looks so good.

570
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,012
I can't wait to not eat this.

571
00:20:20,096 --> 00:20:21,839
- Good?
- We're good? Thank you.

572
00:20:21,923 --> 00:20:23,667
Let's go this way.
Go around, to the right.

573
00:20:23,751 --> 00:20:25,116
You see anything over there?

574
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,426
- No.
- Gary.

575
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,806
Let's go over here.

576
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,322
- You see anything?
- I'm looking.

577
00:20:30,406 --> 00:20:32,012
No.

578
00:20:32,096 --> 00:20:34,529
- Nothing.
- Gary, what are we not seeing?

579
00:20:34,613 --> 00:20:36,047
It's not gonna be here.

580
00:20:36,131 --> 00:20:37,426
No, no.

581
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,116
Come on.

582
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,737
Let's go across the way.

583
00:20:42,821 --> 00:20:44,908
Go back over, D?

584
00:20:44,992 --> 00:20:46,806
- Post office?
- We got it, Riley. Let's go!

585
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:51,184
Go, go, go, go, go.

586
00:20:51,268 --> 00:20:53,184
There it is, Chee! Lions.

587
00:20:53,268 --> 00:20:55,737
- Lions right there.
- I know, I just said that, Chee!

588
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,081
- I'm sorry.
- Come this way.

589
00:20:57,165 --> 00:20:58,253
Please, please, please, please.

590
00:20:58,337 --> 00:20:59,461
- Clue? Clue, please?
- Please.

591
00:20:59,545 --> 00:21:01,392
- Clue? Clue?
- Clue, please?

592
00:21:01,476 --> 00:21:02,565
Clue? Clue?

593
00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:04,357
Clue? No? Clue? No?

594
00:21:04,441 --> 00:21:05,495
No clue?

595
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:07,012
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

596
00:21:07,096 --> 00:21:07,943
This is ridiculous.

597
00:21:08,027 --> 00:21:09,943
Where is it?

598
00:21:10,027 --> 00:21:11,184
- Here, Hung, here.
- Oh, here, here.

599
00:21:11,268 --> 00:21:12,495
All right, let's do this.

600
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:14,012
Be aggressive. In his mouth!

601
00:21:14,096 --> 00:21:15,461
Oh, my gosh!

602
00:21:16,854 --> 00:21:18,012
- Central Post Office.
- Central Post Office.

603
00:21:18,096 --> 00:21:19,441
Let's go!

604
00:21:20,992 --> 00:21:21,908
Hello!

605
00:21:21,992 --> 00:21:23,081
We put this in the bucket?

606
00:21:23,165 --> 00:21:24,081
Yeah.

607
00:21:24,165 --> 00:21:26,304
Or do we... we put it in there?

608
00:21:27,923 --> 00:21:30,737
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

609
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:31,943
- Boyfriends are here now.
- Oh.

610
00:21:32,027 --> 00:21:33,357
- The end up catching up with us.
- I got one.

611
00:21:33,441 --> 00:21:34,737
- Right there. Right there!
- Where?

612
00:21:34,821 --> 00:21:36,426
Oh, we missed that. Damn!

613
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,116
Hi.

614
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,151
Thank... oh...

615
00:21:40,235 --> 00:21:41,289
- We'll take that one.
- "Return to your horse

616
00:21:41,373 --> 00:21:43,900
- and mix them together."
- Put it in there.

617
00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:46,281
- We need to go back.
- Let's go.

618
00:21:46,366 --> 00:21:47,376
One more.

619
00:21:47,461 --> 00:21:48,598
- There's grass somewhere.
- Grass is somewhere.

620
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:49,634
Hey, where are these
buckets at?

621
00:21:49,718 --> 00:21:50,634
Are they on the back?

622
00:21:50,718 --> 00:21:51,634
- Mix it together?
- It says

623
00:21:51,718 --> 00:21:53,228
"Everything except the grass."

624
00:21:53,368 --> 00:21:54,510
- Oh, it's in here.
- Oh.

625
00:21:54,595 --> 00:21:56,159
"The marked vendors
have your ingredients."

626
00:21:56,243 --> 00:21:57,620
Okay, let's go.
This way first? Over there.

627
00:21:57,704 --> 00:21:59,047
- Hello.
- Marked vendors? Yeah.

628
00:21:59,131 --> 00:22:00,565
- I got it.
- Okay, let's go.

629
00:22:00,649 --> 00:22:01,737
What's the next one?

630
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,703
- Delicious.
- I'm not doing it.

631
00:22:03,787 --> 00:22:05,992
I'm so happy I'm not doing that.

632
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:09,116
Yum, yum, yum. Eat, enjoy it.

633
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,047
We passed Gary and Deangelo
and Maddison and Riley.

634
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:14,289
They left the heel-running
before we did

635
00:22:14,373 --> 00:22:16,978
and we're here first
and feeding our horse first.

636
00:22:17,062 --> 00:22:18,220
Good boy.

637
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:20,151
- Here.
- Thank you.

638
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:21,737
- That's two, yeah?
- One more.

639
00:22:21,821 --> 00:22:23,012
Aw.

640
00:22:23,096 --> 00:22:24,634
Thank you!

641
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,151
"Mehan Garden is having
a rock show.

642
00:22:26,235 --> 00:22:27,770
Travel here to get
your next clue."

643
00:22:27,854 --> 00:22:29,289
"Travel on foot." More running.

644
00:22:29,373 --> 00:22:30,598
Holy crap.

645
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,461
- We got it. Yes.
- We're in first place.

646
00:22:32,545 --> 00:22:35,392
- Let's go back. One, two, three?
- Hold up. This way?

647
00:22:35,476 --> 00:22:36,839
- We got three. Gary.
- Take it.

648
00:22:36,923 --> 00:22:38,461
- Come on.
- Come on.

649
00:22:38,545 --> 00:22:39,839
- I got it.
- All right, hold on, hold on, hold on.

650
00:22:39,923 --> 00:22:41,426
Don't spill it, yeah?

651
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,426
- "Mix all your ingredients," besides the grass.
- Yeah.

652
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,253
- Here we go. Ready?
- Okay.

653
00:22:45,337 --> 00:22:46,703
All right, awesome.
Riley, grab it.

654
00:22:46,787 --> 00:22:49,220
- Yeah, go, go, go.
- Mehan Garden?

655
00:22:49,304 --> 00:22:50,392
Mehan Garden?

656
00:22:50,476 --> 00:22:51,943
Damn it, Gar.

657
00:22:52,027 --> 00:22:53,220
Good? We done?

658
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:54,943
Take it, D.
Take it, D. Take it, D.

659
00:22:55,027 --> 00:22:57,220
- Thank you. Come on.
- This way.

660
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,770
Will, I don't know

661
00:22:59,854 --> 00:23:01,081
- how we're gonna cross.
- Thank you, thank you!

662
00:23:01,165 --> 00:23:02,770
Salamat.

663
00:23:02,854 --> 00:23:04,461
Geez Louise.

664
00:23:04,545 --> 00:23:06,081
I think it's right here.

665
00:23:06,165 --> 00:23:07,875
How cool.

666
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:09,357
Look at this music box.

667
00:23:14,649 --> 00:23:17,495
Ready?

668
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:19,322
Listen to the band
play a medley of songs

669
00:23:19,406 --> 00:23:20,598
you've heard on the race.

670
00:23:20,682 --> 00:23:23,875
This is the final
and most difficult challenge

671
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:27,184
that teams will face before
checking into the Pit Stop.

672
00:23:27,268 --> 00:23:30,184
Teams must identify
four pieces of music

673
00:23:30,268 --> 00:23:32,529
that they've heard
during the race.

674
00:23:59,441 --> 00:24:01,806
They must find
four instrument cases

675
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:05,220
identified with a national flag
representing the four countries

676
00:24:05,304 --> 00:24:07,565
that they've heard the songs in.

677
00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:11,047
Teams will hear the songs played
in a particular order,

678
00:24:11,131 --> 00:24:13,322
but they'll have to present
their boxes in the order

679
00:24:13,406 --> 00:24:15,529
they heard those songs
on the race

680
00:24:15,613 --> 00:24:17,529
to get their next clue.

681
00:24:17,613 --> 00:24:19,184
We got this.

682
00:24:19,268 --> 00:24:22,875
Hold on.
"Search through the cases

683
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:25,151
- loaded in the marked vehicle."
- Right there.

684
00:24:25,235 --> 00:24:27,184
- Go.
- Hurry up.

685
00:24:27,268 --> 00:24:30,012
- Let's keep our lead.
- Is this it?

686
00:24:30,096 --> 00:24:31,253
Riley. They're right there.

687
00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:34,461
"Match the flag
on each side of each case

688
00:24:34,545 --> 00:24:36,461
- in order of location they were played on the race."
- Okay.

689
00:24:36,545 --> 00:24:38,357
This is Colombia.

690
00:24:38,441 --> 00:24:40,184
No, that's not Colombia.

691
00:24:40,268 --> 00:24:41,392
The beards are here.

692
00:24:41,476 --> 00:24:42,839
Let's go, let's go.

693
00:24:42,923 --> 00:24:44,047
Do you guys know
where Chee and Hung are?

694
00:24:44,131 --> 00:24:45,565
- I don't know.
- No clue?

695
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:47,184
We're ahead
of Deangelo and Gary.

696
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:49,220
Yeah,
Deangelo and Gary are not here.

697
00:24:49,304 --> 00:24:52,012
What did Trinidad and Tobago
look like?

698
00:24:52,096 --> 00:24:53,703
It might be "Day-O," right?

699
00:24:53,787 --> 00:24:55,770
- Will, I got it.
- What are we taking, dude?

700
00:24:55,854 --> 00:24:57,426
"Match the flag on the side
of each case

701
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,703
"in the order of the location

702
00:24:58,787 --> 00:24:59,770
they were played in
on the race."

703
00:24:59,854 --> 00:25:01,151
- Oh.
- Wow.

704
00:25:01,235 --> 00:25:02,875
The boyfriends
and the beard bros are here.

705
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:06,047
- Wait, listen, listen.
- There's only four songs.

706
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:07,839
Think about all the places
that had music.

707
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,839
Did we hear music in India?

708
00:25:09,923 --> 00:25:11,634
What is this from?

709
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,529
There was a marked truck
that had all these cases

710
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,978
for a rock band,
but on each case was a flag.

711
00:25:17,062 --> 00:25:20,220
- That was... Riley, that was Bogotá.
- I know. Colombia. I know.

712
00:25:20,304 --> 00:25:21,908
That a way, Riley!

713
00:25:23,062 --> 00:25:24,184
Yes!

714
00:25:24,268 --> 00:25:25,529
The flags in the truck

715
00:25:25,613 --> 00:25:26,703
represented where we had heard

716
00:25:26,787 --> 00:25:27,875
the songs along the race.

717
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,392
And so, we were
supposed to match

718
00:25:30,476 --> 00:25:31,770
the songs that they're playing

719
00:25:31,854 --> 00:25:34,012
with the places
that we visited on the race.

720
00:25:34,096 --> 00:25:35,770
There were some songs that we
knew and there were some songs

721
00:25:35,854 --> 00:25:37,703
that we didn't, so it made it
really challenging.

722
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:39,529
- Listen to it, Gary.
- I am.

723
00:25:39,613 --> 00:25:42,184
- No clue.
- This is Trinidad?

724
00:25:45,441 --> 00:25:46,806
That is for sure Trinidad.

725
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,253
Just bring these four and go.

726
00:25:48,337 --> 00:25:50,289
I don't even
remember hearing these songs.

727
00:25:50,373 --> 00:25:52,289
- Let's do it.
- No, wait, wait, wait.

728
00:25:52,373 --> 00:25:55,737
- This is three and four.
- Let's go.

729
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,131
I like your sunglasses.

730
00:26:02,545 --> 00:26:04,770
No. I'm sorry.

731
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:07,529
- It's okay. Thank you.
- Yeah.

732
00:26:07,613 --> 00:26:08,770
Come on.
Let's just take them over there.

733
00:26:08,854 --> 00:26:10,220
We don't know
if it's even these!

734
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,476
I think we're right.

735
00:26:13,787 --> 00:26:15,268
Wow.

736
00:26:16,268 --> 00:26:18,495
Incorrect.
Head back to the truck.

737
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:19,978
- Yep.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

738
00:26:20,062 --> 00:26:21,598
- Do you think it's the order, Riley?
- Yeah, yeah.

739
00:26:21,682 --> 00:26:25,047
- Four is Paraguay. No, four is Trinidad.
- Quiet.

740
00:26:25,131 --> 00:26:27,545
We got to line them
up in the order that they play it.

741
00:26:29,441 --> 00:26:31,220
Over there?

742
00:26:31,304 --> 00:26:33,253
Thank you.

743
00:26:33,337 --> 00:26:34,461
Chee, over here.

744
00:26:34,545 --> 00:26:35,839
- One more.
- You see it?

745
00:26:35,923 --> 00:26:37,806
Yeah,
right there. Go, go, go, go, go

746
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,406
Hi.

747
00:26:41,718 --> 00:26:43,289
- Let's go.
- Okay. I'm gonna mix it.

748
00:26:43,373 --> 00:26:45,081
As fast as you can.

749
00:26:45,165 --> 00:26:47,081
- I can hold it, Hung.
- Okay.

750
00:26:47,165 --> 00:26:48,253
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

751
00:26:48,337 --> 00:26:49,839
Come on, come on, come on.

752
00:26:49,923 --> 00:26:51,529
I think we're
in last place right now,

753
00:26:51,613 --> 00:26:53,573
so hopefully we can make up time
at the next task.

754
00:26:59,062 --> 00:27:02,565
The band over there is playing
a medley of tunes

755
00:27:02,649 --> 00:27:04,770
that we heard on the race.

756
00:27:04,854 --> 00:27:07,426
And we have to match up these
boxes that have flags on them

757
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,908
in the order
that they play them.

758
00:27:08,992 --> 00:27:11,770
It's Bogotá, Colombia
is the second one.

759
00:27:11,854 --> 00:27:13,116
I think Berlin is the first one.

760
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,289
We're just trying to remember

761
00:27:14,373 --> 00:27:15,943
all the countries
that we went to.

762
00:27:16,027 --> 00:27:18,737
Let's just go try one.
Let's just go try.

763
00:27:18,821 --> 00:27:19,908
Four.

764
00:27:19,992 --> 00:27:21,220
We just did a little reorder.

765
00:27:21,304 --> 00:27:23,184
Hopefully that's right.

766
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:25,426
Still wrong?

767
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,682
Yeah.

768
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:31,151
Thank you.
How did we not get that?

769
00:27:31,235 --> 00:27:32,839
Hey, you guys want
to work together?

770
00:27:32,923 --> 00:27:34,184
No. Sorry, no.

771
00:27:34,268 --> 00:27:36,392
- Okay.
- Gary and Deangelo yelled out,

772
00:27:36,476 --> 00:27:38,598
"Do y'all want to work
together?" and I said no.

773
00:27:38,682 --> 00:27:40,116
We knew all the flags,

774
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,770
so I felt confident
that we could do it.

775
00:27:41,854 --> 00:27:43,787
It's not Kazakhstan.

776
00:27:44,854 --> 00:27:46,529
Where else played music?

777
00:27:46,613 --> 00:27:48,012
Paraguay?

778
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,461
We got it.

779
00:27:49,545 --> 00:27:51,373
I don't know, dude.

780
00:27:54,682 --> 00:27:56,220
It's incorrect.

781
00:27:56,304 --> 00:27:57,598
Really?

782
00:27:57,682 --> 00:27:59,718
All right, I-let's go back
to the drawing board.

783
00:28:03,062 --> 00:28:05,165
Every one of us guessing.

784
00:28:07,027 --> 00:28:09,253
Come on.
This is very tough, man.

785
00:28:09,337 --> 00:28:11,047
- Please.
- Come on.

786
00:28:11,131 --> 00:28:13,634
That is incorrect.

787
00:28:13,718 --> 00:28:15,289
This is tough.

788
00:28:15,373 --> 00:28:16,737
- Right here.
- Here, here, here, here.

789
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:18,012
Oh, there goes Chee-Hu, bro.

790
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,220
There's... Chee-Hu
just showed up.

791
00:28:19,304 --> 00:28:20,392
That's fine.

792
00:28:20,476 --> 00:28:21,839
Every team's struggling
with this.

793
00:28:21,923 --> 00:28:23,357
"Match the flag on the side
of each case

794
00:28:23,441 --> 00:28:25,253
in the order of location
they were played on the race."

795
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:27,151
- We can catch up here, Chee.
- Okay, so we're just gonna

796
00:28:27,235 --> 00:28:28,476
- grab flags?
- Yeah.

797
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:33,184
Kazakhstan, Colombia, Cambodia.

798
00:28:33,268 --> 00:28:35,703
We need these, uh...
This is nuts.

799
00:28:35,787 --> 00:28:37,476
I don't know. Whatever.

800
00:28:44,441 --> 00:28:46,151
We got nothing.

801
00:28:46,235 --> 00:28:48,806
- Let's go.
- What do you think?

802
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,978
I-I'm drawing a complete blank.

803
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,357
We should just work together.

804
00:28:52,441 --> 00:28:53,598
This is the first time
we heard the medley.

805
00:28:53,682 --> 00:28:55,047
Yeah, we don't even know
what songs they are.

806
00:28:55,131 --> 00:28:56,253
- We didn't even hear the songs yet.
- Oh.

807
00:28:56,337 --> 00:28:57,392
Stop, D.

808
00:28:57,476 --> 00:29:00,081
Nobody's gonna help anybody.

809
00:29:00,165 --> 00:29:02,012
- Hey, guys.
- Y'all, this is tricky.

810
00:29:02,096 --> 00:29:03,806
This is brutal, dude.

811
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:06,610
- This is gonna be a while.
- My feet are raw from running.

812
00:29:11,854 --> 00:29:12,992
No.

813
00:29:14,373 --> 00:29:15,667
- You're pretty sure on those three?
- Nope.

814
00:29:15,751 --> 00:29:17,081
I'm not sure on any of them.

815
00:29:17,165 --> 00:29:19,220
We know all the flags,
we just don't know the songs.

816
00:29:19,304 --> 00:29:20,737
- Oh, come on, Hung. Let's go.
- Maddison.

817
00:29:20,821 --> 00:29:22,151
This is really dumb.

818
00:29:22,235 --> 00:29:24,304
We're literally guessing.

819
00:29:28,787 --> 00:29:29,839
- Nope.
- Okay.

820
00:29:31,304 --> 00:29:34,268
I don't feel like
anyone's gonna get this.

821
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,959
It's not the right answer.

822
00:29:39,992 --> 00:29:41,613
You'll have to do better
than that.

823
00:29:43,545 --> 00:29:45,062
It's a big no.

824
00:29:46,992 --> 00:29:49,253
- Try again.
- This is unreal.

825
00:29:49,337 --> 00:29:51,978
I don't know
what we're doing wrong.

826
00:29:52,062 --> 00:29:54,062
Worst game ever.

827
00:30:02,545 --> 00:30:03,978
This is stupid.

828
00:30:04,062 --> 00:30:06,081
Trinidad,
we know that one's for sure.

829
00:30:06,165 --> 00:30:07,667
Colombia, we know
that one is for sure.

830
00:30:07,751 --> 00:30:09,565
Come on,
D. All we can do is keep trying.

831
00:30:09,649 --> 00:30:11,165
This is brutal, bro.

832
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:14,613
God.

833
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:18,495
Incorrect.

834
00:30:18,579 --> 00:30:20,839
This is unreal.

835
00:30:22,751 --> 00:30:24,322
I really, like, I'm stumped.

836
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,565
Let's go talk to
Hung and Chee and them.

837
00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:28,770
We kept trying every single flag

838
00:30:28,854 --> 00:30:30,908
that we've ever been to
on the race

839
00:30:30,992 --> 00:30:33,184
and we kept doing it over
and over and over,

840
00:30:33,268 --> 00:30:36,012
but everything
that we tried was wrong.

841
00:30:36,096 --> 00:30:37,667
And it was very frustrating.

842
00:30:37,751 --> 00:30:39,461
What do you guys think
for the songs?

843
00:30:39,545 --> 00:30:40,737
Colombia and Trinidad are locks.

844
00:30:40,821 --> 00:30:42,012
- Yes, that... for sure.
- Two and four.

845
00:30:42,096 --> 00:30:43,495
Two and four
are the obvious ones.

846
00:30:43,579 --> 00:30:44,770
One and three are not easy.

847
00:30:44,854 --> 00:30:48,047
Once we realized how hard
this was going to be,

848
00:30:48,131 --> 00:30:50,081
we decided that we had
to work with our alliance.

849
00:30:50,165 --> 00:30:51,667
We had to.

850
00:30:51,751 --> 00:30:53,598
Guys, it doesn't matter
who wins this leg of the race.

851
00:30:53,682 --> 00:30:56,392
If us six put our heads together
to solve this problem,

852
00:30:56,476 --> 00:30:57,943
we're all gonna advance.

853
00:30:58,027 --> 00:31:02,184
It was at that point
where our light bulbs turned on.

854
00:31:02,268 --> 00:31:04,770
We have a shot
at being the final three.

855
00:31:04,854 --> 00:31:06,770
All we have to do
is help each other

856
00:31:06,854 --> 00:31:09,392
and not give this information
to Gary and Deangelo.

857
00:31:09,476 --> 00:31:11,289
One, two,

858
00:31:11,373 --> 00:31:13,220
three, four, okay?

859
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:15,875
Two is Colombia,
four is Trinidad.

860
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:17,322
We need to crank out my list.

861
00:31:17,406 --> 00:31:19,322
That way we don't think
and we just crank them out.

862
00:31:19,406 --> 00:31:21,322
Since we're confident in two,
we only have to do, like,

863
00:31:21,406 --> 00:31:23,151
- 15 permutations.
- Yeah.

864
00:31:23,235 --> 00:31:25,598
You try one, we try one,
and then whoever gets it,

865
00:31:25,682 --> 00:31:27,703
walk off and then come around
and tell us.

866
00:31:27,787 --> 00:31:29,289
We're just gonna have
to drill this out.

867
00:31:29,373 --> 00:31:30,703
We haven't done
Kazakhstan and France.

868
00:31:30,787 --> 00:31:32,598
How about we...
Hung and I try that?

869
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,598
- Yeah. Don't say it in front of them, yeah?
- Okay.

870
00:31:34,682 --> 00:31:36,081
Need to go back to the truck.

871
00:31:36,165 --> 00:31:38,151
- Ugh...
- I don't know what to tell you, D.

872
00:31:38,235 --> 00:31:39,151
First Kazakhstan, France third.

873
00:31:39,235 --> 00:31:40,151
Come on, Chee.

874
00:31:40,235 --> 00:31:41,289
- Stop talking, Riley.
- I know.

875
00:31:41,373 --> 00:31:42,770
- Come on, Chee.
- Hold on, hold on.

876
00:31:42,854 --> 00:31:45,634
We were sure
that the second song played

877
00:31:45,718 --> 00:31:48,908
was from Colombia
and the fourth song played

878
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,426
was "Day-O," the Trinidad
and Tobago song.

879
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,806
One and three we were unsure of,

880
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,289
so we had written out

881
00:31:54,373 --> 00:31:56,220
every single
permutation possible...

882
00:31:56,304 --> 00:31:57,737
Still not the right answer.

883
00:31:57,821 --> 00:32:00,151
...keeping Colombia
and Trinidad and Tobago

884
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:01,184
in those two slots.

885
00:32:01,268 --> 00:32:02,461
We're just going down the list.

886
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:03,667
You guys can do
France and Germany now.

887
00:32:03,751 --> 00:32:05,012
France and Germany
as one and three?

888
00:32:05,096 --> 00:32:06,392
Yeah, one and three.

889
00:32:06,476 --> 00:32:07,634
So the game plan was,
we would try one,

890
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:09,151
cross it off, and then

891
00:32:09,235 --> 00:32:10,565
Chee and Hung would try one
and cross it off

892
00:32:10,649 --> 00:32:12,495
and then the boyfriends would
try one and cross it off

893
00:32:12,579 --> 00:32:13,839
until we finally happened
to stumble upon

894
00:32:13,923 --> 00:32:15,253
the right combination.

895
00:32:15,337 --> 00:32:16,839
They're doing a lot
of whispering, bro.

896
00:32:16,923 --> 00:32:18,703
Guys,
we're halfway done. Do Paraguay, Colombia,

897
00:32:18,787 --> 00:32:19,978
Kazakhstan, Trinidad.

898
00:32:20,062 --> 00:32:22,012
Damn it, Gary. They are
helping each other, bro.

899
00:32:22,096 --> 00:32:24,392
There was a lot of people
talking to people

900
00:32:24,476 --> 00:32:25,667
and obviously that alliance
is broken

901
00:32:25,751 --> 00:32:27,253
and the gloves have come off.

902
00:32:27,337 --> 00:32:29,667
That was, that was a surprise,

903
00:32:29,751 --> 00:32:31,770
but we just keep true to
our word and some people don't.

904
00:32:31,854 --> 00:32:33,703
The alliance is over. It's off.

905
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:35,598
Obviously. Oh, my God.

906
00:32:35,682 --> 00:32:36,875
I think we're done.

907
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:38,770
They all three banded together
to eliminate us.

908
00:32:38,854 --> 00:32:40,510
That sucks, dude.

909
00:32:42,545 --> 00:32:44,081
We got to go, Gary.
We got to go.

910
00:32:44,165 --> 00:32:45,634
They didn't stick to their
word. They're all scared of us.

911
00:32:45,718 --> 00:32:46,978
This is bad, bro.

912
00:32:47,062 --> 00:32:48,322
We need France and Paraguay.

913
00:32:48,406 --> 00:32:50,461
- Okay.
- We're almost done with the list.

914
00:32:50,545 --> 00:32:51,745
Gary, this may be it.

915
00:32:52,682 --> 00:32:54,165
We need to get out of here.

916
00:33:01,304 --> 00:33:03,667
No.

917
00:33:03,751 --> 00:33:05,461
Uh, no.

918
00:33:05,545 --> 00:33:06,978
- Incorrect.
- Okay.

919
00:33:07,062 --> 00:33:08,634
You did Kazakhstan and Germany?

920
00:33:08,718 --> 00:33:10,151
- Yeah.
- Okay. Kazakhstan and Paraguay.

921
00:33:10,235 --> 00:33:11,634
- Last one. We're gonna get it.
- Okay.

922
00:33:11,718 --> 00:33:13,667
If this doesn't work,
then I don't know.

923
00:33:13,751 --> 00:33:15,978
Bro,
this is awful, bro.

924
00:33:16,062 --> 00:33:17,634
This is awful.

925
00:33:17,718 --> 00:33:19,337
If they get it, we're done.

926
00:33:20,649 --> 00:33:22,806
- Did they get it?
- Come on, come on, come on.

927
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:24,634
Come on, come on, come on.

928
00:33:24,718 --> 00:33:25,598
Try again.

929
00:33:25,682 --> 00:33:27,703
- Damn it, dude.
- No, it's wrong.

930
00:33:27,787 --> 00:33:29,943
- We're out of all the other permutations.
- Are we doing this right?

931
00:33:30,027 --> 00:33:31,529
- Come on, Gary. We got to move.
- Guys, I don't know.

932
00:33:31,613 --> 00:33:34,770
We did, we did
every possible variation.

933
00:33:34,854 --> 00:33:36,737
- That's why I'm confused.
- This is so defeating.

934
00:33:36,821 --> 00:33:38,253
This is unbelievable.

935
00:33:38,337 --> 00:33:41,357
Um, I don't know. Maybe there's
something we were missing.

936
00:33:41,441 --> 00:33:43,392
Are... I mean, Tobago's for sure.

937
00:33:43,476 --> 00:33:45,289
What-what if Colombia's wrong?
The carnival song.

938
00:33:45,373 --> 00:33:47,184
- You know...
- That's Colombia for sure.

939
00:33:47,268 --> 00:33:49,047
- It was the-the tightrope.
- I know, I know.

940
00:33:49,131 --> 00:33:50,598
- That was the tightrope.
- I know,

941
00:33:50,682 --> 00:33:52,357
but I'm just, like, trying
to think of something else,

942
00:33:52,441 --> 00:33:54,649
'cause, what, are we done?

943
00:33:55,718 --> 00:33:56,908
- What?
- We're gonna try Brazil.

944
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,426
We got to add, like,
India in here?

945
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:00,081
We're just trying
now. Trial and error.

946
00:34:00,165 --> 00:34:01,908
At this point,
we should just throw some Hail Marys.

947
00:34:01,992 --> 00:34:04,875
Just take one out blindly,
take another one out

948
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,253
and just do it.

949
00:34:06,337 --> 00:34:08,253
There's four songs playing.

950
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,771
We know two and four.

951
00:34:10,855 --> 00:34:12,909
One and three, nobody has
any idea what they are.

952
00:34:12,993 --> 00:34:14,391
None.

953
00:34:14,475 --> 00:34:15,875
We're just trying stuff now.

954
00:34:15,959 --> 00:34:17,496
We're just grabbing
and plugging and playing.

955
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,943
I don't think anybody
has any clue.

956
00:34:19,027 --> 00:34:20,150
No clue.

957
00:34:20,234 --> 00:34:21,599
We'll probably
be here till dark.

958
00:34:21,683 --> 00:34:23,840
- No, it's the wrong answer.
- Dang.

959
00:34:23,924 --> 00:34:25,771
I'm so confused.

960
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,116
Something is wrong.

961
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,427
I think we went through
every single combination

962
00:34:29,511 --> 00:34:31,634
before I just said, "Hey,

963
00:34:31,718 --> 00:34:33,442
let's go read our clue."

964
00:34:37,406 --> 00:34:39,771
Read your clue. Classic.

965
00:34:39,855 --> 00:34:41,840
- Oh, my God.
- So I pulled out the clue

966
00:34:41,924 --> 00:34:44,150
and I read,
"Put everything in the order

967
00:34:44,234 --> 00:34:46,047
that you heard it on the race,"

968
00:34:46,131 --> 00:34:47,668
not that you're hearing it here,

969
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:48,806
and light bulb goes off.

970
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:50,253
I reread the clue.

971
00:34:50,337 --> 00:34:51,496
It's not the order that
the medley's been playing...

972
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,288
The order that we heard it.
We just read it.

973
00:34:53,372 --> 00:34:55,460
Exact same time, Hung and Chee

974
00:34:55,544 --> 00:34:56,840
read their clue, too,

975
00:34:56,924 --> 00:34:58,599
and so we had another
collaboration moment

976
00:34:58,683 --> 00:35:00,427
of, like, "Y'all,
we're doing this wrong."

977
00:35:00,511 --> 00:35:02,047
It's not the order
that they're playing it now,

978
00:35:02,131 --> 00:35:03,427
it's the order
that it was in the race,

979
00:35:03,511 --> 00:35:05,771
so Trinidad one, Colombia two.

980
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:07,771
And then we need to do
the other, the other two.

981
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,978
That's the unlock, guys.

982
00:35:10,062 --> 00:35:11,234
Wow.

983
00:35:12,993 --> 00:35:15,372
Trinidad
and Colombia one and two.

984
00:35:27,027 --> 00:35:28,012
We got it?

985
00:35:28,096 --> 00:35:29,580
That is correct.

986
00:35:32,718 --> 00:35:34,530
Yeah, baby.

987
00:35:34,614 --> 00:35:36,322
- All right.
- Did they get it?

988
00:35:36,406 --> 00:35:37,943
- They got it.
- Beard bros just got it.

989
00:35:38,027 --> 00:35:40,184
Yeah, they got it.

990
00:35:40,268 --> 00:35:42,496
"Make your way to where it's at,
back to where you saw Phil

991
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,771
but now there's a mat,
it's as easy as that."

992
00:35:44,855 --> 00:35:45,978
Good job, guys.

993
00:35:46,062 --> 00:35:47,565
- James, come here.
- He's coming.

994
00:35:47,649 --> 00:35:49,649
- Chee, he's coming.
- Go. Go, go, go.

995
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,978
It's-it's-it's, um,
it's the first two,

996
00:35:54,062 --> 00:35:55,599
- so it's, uh...
- Trinidad, Colombia.

997
00:35:55,683 --> 00:35:57,875
T-Trinidad and Colombia,
and then Paraguay, France.

998
00:35:57,959 --> 00:36:00,496
- Hey, just remember: do not let them see.
- Okay.

999
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:03,081
He just told them.
He just told them all.

1000
00:36:03,165 --> 00:36:04,599
- Are you serious?
- Where do we go?

1001
00:36:04,683 --> 00:36:05,840
Lapu Lapu Circle.

1002
00:36:05,924 --> 00:36:07,703
- It's that big statue.
- Run!

1003
00:36:07,787 --> 00:36:09,116
Yes!

1004
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,565
- That sucks.
- We're done.

1005
00:36:10,649 --> 00:36:12,081
Once they get it, we're done.

1006
00:36:12,165 --> 00:36:13,806
We'll just take the penalty.
We're not gonna figure it out.

1007
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:17,150
Well, well,
we out of here, Gary.

1008
00:36:17,234 --> 00:36:18,840
That is correct.

1009
00:36:18,924 --> 00:36:20,565
- Thank you, thank you.
- Thank you. Salamat po.

1010
00:36:20,649 --> 00:36:21,737
Okay, come on.

1011
00:36:21,821 --> 00:36:23,116
- Go, babe.
- How far is that?

1012
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,875
- Like, half a mile.
- Come on.

1013
00:36:24,959 --> 00:36:26,047
Wow.

1014
00:36:26,131 --> 00:36:27,116
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

1015
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,806
- Finally.
- Okay, let's go.

1016
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,012
- We're done.
- There's no point in us trying.

1017
00:36:31,096 --> 00:36:33,047
We saw the beard bros
run up there and help

1018
00:36:33,131 --> 00:36:35,634
the other two teams,
and then they both ran by us

1019
00:36:35,718 --> 00:36:36,978
and didn't say a word,
which is whatever.

1020
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:38,806
It's like, there's nothing
we can do about it.

1021
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,253
We knew we weren't
gonna figure it out.

1022
00:36:40,337 --> 00:36:42,047
We had no idea
what it was, so...

1023
00:36:42,131 --> 00:36:43,496
We just took
the two-hour penalty.

1024
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,875
I told you they
was doing a lot of whispering.

1025
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:46,184
That alliance has been going on

1026
00:36:46,268 --> 00:36:47,909
since leg two.

1027
00:36:47,993 --> 00:36:50,219
We worked together,
we trusted each other.

1028
00:36:50,303 --> 00:36:52,771
Right. And then that came back
to bite us in the ass

1029
00:36:52,855 --> 00:36:54,875
here in this last leg, but...

1030
00:36:54,959 --> 00:36:56,565
At the end of this race,
there's gonna be one team happy.

1031
00:36:56,649 --> 00:36:58,288
- Correct.
- Ten teams are gonna be pissed,

1032
00:36:58,372 --> 00:37:00,288
and it's gonna be interesting,

1033
00:37:00,372 --> 00:37:01,496
because they can't work
together as a group of three

1034
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,806
when this million dollars is up.

1035
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,219
Get ready to take a nap.

1036
00:37:11,406 --> 00:37:12,599
- Oh, right here, Riley.
- Yeah.

1037
00:37:12,683 --> 00:37:15,027
Done, baby.

1038
00:37:19,372 --> 00:37:21,909
Welcome to Manila,
the Philippines.

1039
00:37:21,993 --> 00:37:23,358
Thank you so much.

1040
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:24,787
Riley and Maddison...

1041
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,012
...you are team number one.

1042
00:37:27,096 --> 00:37:29,530
- Yes, baby!
- Congratulations.

1043
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:30,978
You are one of the three teams

1044
00:37:31,062 --> 00:37:32,943
who will be racing
to the finish line

1045
00:37:33,027 --> 00:37:34,703
for $1 million.

1046
00:37:34,787 --> 00:37:35,806
Yes.

1047
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:38,184
We're going to the finals, baby.

1048
00:37:38,268 --> 00:37:40,219
Maddison and I are
peaking right now.

1049
00:37:40,303 --> 00:37:43,599
We've won the past three legs
of the race,

1050
00:37:43,683 --> 00:37:45,358
and I think we're gonna win it.

1051
00:37:45,442 --> 00:37:46,840
An amazing leg, guys.

1052
00:37:46,924 --> 00:37:48,943
- Thank you.
- But you did help out another team.

1053
00:37:49,027 --> 00:37:50,253
Well, we wouldn't have
gotten that last one

1054
00:37:50,337 --> 00:37:51,599
if it wasn't for Hung
to point out the clue.

1055
00:37:51,683 --> 00:37:53,012
So we had to help them.

1056
00:37:53,096 --> 00:37:55,047
Okay, it looks like we have
another team coming in.

1057
00:37:55,131 --> 00:37:56,322
Who's it gonna be?
Stay right where you are.

1058
00:37:56,406 --> 00:37:57,460
The boyfriends.

1059
00:37:57,544 --> 00:37:58,890
Come on, baby.

1060
00:38:01,372 --> 00:38:04,737
Ah, we frickin' did it!

1061
00:38:04,821 --> 00:38:07,081
We did it.

1062
00:38:07,165 --> 00:38:09,027
- Baby.
- Guys, we did it, baby.

1063
00:38:10,787 --> 00:38:12,427
- Will and James...
- Yes.

1064
00:38:12,511 --> 00:38:14,427
...you are one
of the three teams

1065
00:38:14,511 --> 00:38:16,427
that will be racing
to the finish line

1066
00:38:16,511 --> 00:38:18,511
for $1 million.

1067
00:38:19,683 --> 00:38:21,219
We've worked so hard

1068
00:38:21,303 --> 00:38:23,634
the entire race to get here.

1069
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,081
Being in the final
three just further reaffirms

1070
00:38:26,165 --> 00:38:28,703
the fact that we make
a great team.

1071
00:38:28,787 --> 00:38:32,978
We have laid the foundation
of love from start till now,

1072
00:38:33,062 --> 00:38:34,840
and I'm just so excited
we get to do it together.

1073
00:38:34,924 --> 00:38:37,150
- I love you.
- I love you.

1074
00:38:37,234 --> 00:38:40,012
Okay, let's go. Come on.

1075
00:38:40,096 --> 00:38:41,184
Come on, guys!

1076
00:38:41,268 --> 00:38:43,565
Come on, Hung and Chee, come on!

1077
00:38:43,649 --> 00:38:45,268
Yes!

1078
00:38:46,511 --> 00:38:49,012
Tunnel. Tunnel, tunnel,
tunnel, tunnel, tunnel.

1079
00:38:49,096 --> 00:38:52,530
Yes!

1080
00:38:52,614 --> 00:38:54,614
Oh, God!

1081
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:58,771
- Oh, my God.
- Bring it in, baby.

1082
00:38:58,855 --> 00:39:01,391
- This feels so good.
- We did it.

1083
00:39:01,475 --> 00:39:03,047
We did it.

1084
00:39:03,131 --> 00:39:06,081
Hung and Chee, you are standing
with the final three teams...

1085
00:39:06,165 --> 00:39:08,427
...that will be racing...

1086
00:39:08,511 --> 00:39:11,460
Yes!

1087
00:39:11,544 --> 00:39:12,737
We're actually
in the finals, like,

1088
00:39:12,821 --> 00:39:16,771
it's so mind-blowingly unreal.

1089
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:19,358
It was very important
for all of you guys to be here

1090
00:39:19,442 --> 00:39:22,530
in this moment
going into the final leg.

1091
00:39:22,614 --> 00:39:26,184
We chose Maddison and Riley
and Will and James for a reason.

1092
00:39:26,268 --> 00:39:27,978
We felt like they were
very trustworthy people,

1093
00:39:28,062 --> 00:39:30,391
um, who would compete hard

1094
00:39:30,475 --> 00:39:32,253
and because
they're a strong team,

1095
00:39:32,337 --> 00:39:35,427
they would help all of us get
to the final leg of the race.

1096
00:39:35,511 --> 00:39:37,530
So how about I tell you
where you're going to next?

1097
00:39:37,614 --> 00:39:40,427
- Yes.
- You're flying back to the United States,

1098
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,081
and you are going
to New Orleans.

1099
00:39:42,165 --> 00:39:44,253
The Big Easy.

1100
00:39:44,337 --> 00:39:45,771
And I have some more
great news for you.

1101
00:39:45,855 --> 00:39:46,875
You guys will be getting
an upgrade

1102
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:48,565
on the way home.

1103
00:39:48,649 --> 00:39:49,978
- So you can travel...
- So good.

1104
00:39:50,062 --> 00:39:51,737
...with a little more comfort.

1105
00:39:51,821 --> 00:39:55,565
But I'm just wondering how
all of this is gonna work out

1106
00:39:55,649 --> 00:39:56,875
when you're racing
against each other.

1107
00:39:56,959 --> 00:39:58,806
- May the best team win.
- Yes.

1108
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,771
- Exactly.
- It's gonna be a lot of love and admiration and respect.

1109
00:40:00,855 --> 00:40:02,737
Our favorite games
are playing our best friends.

1110
00:40:02,821 --> 00:40:04,219
- Yeah.
- So that's what this is,

1111
00:40:04,303 --> 00:40:05,771
and it's gonna be
an epic battle.

1112
00:40:05,855 --> 00:40:07,391
Yes. That's so true.

1113
00:40:07,475 --> 00:40:09,460
We did it.
All according to plan.

1114
00:40:09,544 --> 00:40:11,012
- All according to plan.
- Are you kidding me?

1115
00:40:11,096 --> 00:40:13,116
- How does that happen?
- We're like masterminds.

1116
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,219
And there is one team missing.

1117
00:40:15,303 --> 00:40:17,993
Thank God.

1118
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:29,668
Let's go, Gary.

1119
00:40:29,752 --> 00:40:31,787
Oh, man.

1120
00:40:40,406 --> 00:40:41,737
Deangelo and Gary,

1121
00:40:41,821 --> 00:40:44,253
you did not complete
the last challenge,

1122
00:40:44,337 --> 00:40:46,752
and unfortunately, you have been
eliminated from the race.

1123
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,047
Any regrets about
coming on the race?

1124
00:40:50,131 --> 00:40:51,322
Yes.

1125
00:40:51,406 --> 00:40:52,737
The race sucked.

1126
00:40:52,821 --> 00:40:54,703
The bad outweighed the good.

1127
00:40:54,787 --> 00:40:56,765
I'd never come back
on the show again.

1128
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,288
Like, the money wasn't
life-changing for me.

1129
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,771
Right, but you didn't enjoy
the experience?

1130
00:40:59,855 --> 00:41:02,322
Well, I could've paid for it
myself and not had to race

1131
00:41:02,406 --> 00:41:04,116
- around the world.
- I did. I enjoyed it.

1132
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,460
- I'll-I'll cross him out.
- Yeah.

1133
00:41:05,544 --> 00:41:06,943
I enjoyed it. I had a blast.

1134
00:41:07,027 --> 00:41:08,810
I had so much fun. Got to go
to a bunch of countries

1135
00:41:08,894 --> 00:41:10,737
I probably wouldn't
have ever gone to on my own.

1136
00:41:10,821 --> 00:41:12,875
I hope, maybe one day,
Deangelo, if you look back,

1137
00:41:12,959 --> 00:41:14,634
you'll remember a few more
good things than bad things.

1138
00:41:14,718 --> 00:41:16,219
- He will. I'll... When we talk about it...
- No.

1139
00:41:16,303 --> 00:41:17,993
...he'll talk about
a lot of what we did.

1140
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,909
Gary was a solid partner.

1141
00:41:20,993 --> 00:41:22,703
At first,
me and D, we were rocky

1142
00:41:22,787 --> 00:41:25,358
'cause we had never competed
where it was just us two,

1143
00:41:25,442 --> 00:41:27,427
- but we got better and better, and...
- Yeah.

1144
00:41:27,511 --> 00:41:28,634
I wouldn't have had
another partner.

1145
00:41:28,718 --> 00:41:30,047
- Appreciate it.
- The other teams,

1146
00:41:30,131 --> 00:41:31,530
they didn't want to face us
in the finals.

1147
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,081
The only one that's
been pushing them was us.

1148
00:41:33,165 --> 00:41:34,427
They don't have that threat
anymore.

1149
00:41:34,511 --> 00:41:36,599
Now they can't work together.

1150
00:41:36,683 --> 00:41:38,184
Alliance is no more.

1151
00:41:38,268 --> 00:41:39,978
- But we're okay with that.
- Mwah.

1152
00:41:40,062 --> 00:41:41,253
Deliver it!

1153
00:41:41,337 --> 00:41:42,771
Delivered! I delivered it!

1154
00:41:42,855 --> 00:41:44,496
The alliance
totally served its purpose,

1155
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,496
but now that we're in
the finals,

1156
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,116
it's where the gloves come off.

1157
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,047
It's the final three.
Everybody is on their own.

1158
00:41:50,131 --> 00:41:52,737
I don't think any of us
are gonna be helping each other.

1159
00:41:52,821 --> 00:41:54,771
We're just gonna continue
to race as hard as we can.

1160
00:41:54,855 --> 00:41:57,116
Oh, my God, oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1161
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,978
The money would be fantastic.
We have three kids.

1162
00:42:00,062 --> 00:42:01,253
They need to go to college.

1163
00:42:01,337 --> 00:42:02,496
Let's go, Hung.

1164
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,391
Winning the race
will only prove

1165
00:42:04,475 --> 00:42:07,081
that we are ready
for that next step together.

1166
00:42:07,165 --> 00:42:09,358
And after this,
we can get engaged

1167
00:42:09,442 --> 00:42:10,787
and start planning a wedding.

1168
00:42:11,787 --> 00:42:13,150
- Do it.
- Yes!

1169
00:42:13,234 --> 00:42:14,565
We have a really good
shot at winning.

1170
00:42:14,649 --> 00:42:16,012
We're gonna win in the final.

1171
00:42:16,096 --> 00:42:18,391
We're gonna race our ass off
in this final leg.

1172
00:42:18,475 --> 00:42:20,184
We are gonna
win The Amazing Race.

1173
00:42:20,268 --> 00:42:23,219
No question about it.
We got this.

season finale of The Amazing Race...

1177
00:42:47,096 --> 00:42:48,703
We're not gonna die.

1178
00:42:48,787 --> 00:42:51,150
...alliances are done...

1179
00:42:51,234 --> 00:42:52,391
Now it's about winning.

1180
00:42:52,475 --> 00:42:54,530
...as teams race
through the Big Easy...

1181
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:55,978
- Go, go, go.
- It's called Fat Tuesday

1182
00:42:56,062 --> 00:42:58,116
for a reason.

1183
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,047
...to win
the $1 million prize...

1184
00:43:00,131 --> 00:43:02,081
- May the best team win.
- Come on!

1185
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:04,322
- Bring it.
- ...andThe Amazing Race.

00:00:00,186 --> 00:00:04,173
<i>My name is Barry Allen, and
I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:04,176 --> 00:00:07,203
<i>To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist.</i>

3
00:00:07,205 --> 00:00:10,285
<i>But secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:10,288 --> 00:00:13,141
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:13,144 --> 00:00:15,407
<i>But when my daughter came
back from the future to help,</i>

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,846
<i>she changed the present.</i>

7
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:20,449
<i>And now our world is
more dangerous than ever,</i>

8
00:00:20,451 --> 00:00:22,885
<i>and I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.</i>

9
00:00:22,887 --> 00:00:25,517
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

10
00:00:26,203 --> 00:00:27,830
Previously on <i>"The Flash"...</i>

11
00:00:27,832 --> 00:00:28,851
Save her.

12
00:00:29,012 --> 00:00:31,142
<i>Our life is a million times
better than what it was</i>

13
00:00:31,143 --> 00:00:32,982
<i>and it's all because of you, Gracie.</i>

14
00:00:33,062 --> 00:00:35,590
Got you some groceries and some
meloxicam for your injuries.

15
00:00:35,591 --> 00:00:36,906
We call it the cure.

16
00:00:36,907 --> 00:00:40,460
It's a serum that suppresses
dark matter in meta-humans.

17
00:00:40,461 --> 00:00:41,437
You're the first person
to take it.

18
00:00:41,447 --> 00:00:44,247
I think we should offer
the cure to Cicada.

19
00:00:44,317 --> 00:00:46,857
<i>From the journal
of Nora West-Allen:</i>

20
00:00:46,937 --> 00:00:49,157
<i>"Timeline is malleable."</i>

21
00:00:49,227 --> 00:00:51,027
<i>Why is she hiding this interest?</i>

22
00:00:51,107 --> 00:00:52,657
Tell me you know
what you're doing.

23
00:00:52,737 --> 00:00:54,997
I am the only speedster
who knows what he's doing!

24
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:56,467
Stick with the plan.

25
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:10,269
The cure is finished,
and it works.

26
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,019
Now we can use it on Dwyer,

27
00:01:12,099 --> 00:01:14,689
and then his connection
to the dagger will be broken.

28
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:19,959
What's wrong?

29
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:22,629
The timeline.

30
00:01:22,699 --> 00:01:26,161
I've charted this timeline
from Anthro the First Boy

31
00:01:26,162 --> 00:01:27,547
to Kamandi the Last.

32
00:01:27,548 --> 00:01:28,469
I know all of it.

33
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:30,079
I know its crests,
I know its valleys,

34
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,749
I know what we must do
to defeat Cicada.

35
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:35,969
Or rather, I knew.

36
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:39,589
This is a photo
of the last public sighting

37
00:01:39,669 --> 00:01:40,799
of Flash and Cicada.

38
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,679
Their final confrontation.

39
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,929
Dad's last chance to use
the cure on Cicada.

40
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:46,809
I've been trying to engineer
a moment like this

41
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:48,095
the whole time I've been there.

42
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:50,699
Now, watch.

43
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:53,149
See this?

44
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:58,149
That is a new timeline
struggling to break through,

45
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,739
manifesting itself
right before our eyes.

46
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:04,499
Is it a good timeline,
or is it a bad timeline?

47
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:06,119
That doesn't matter.

48
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:08,659
What matters is it's new
and, as such, unpredictable,

49
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,749
and we may lose
our window of opportunity.

50
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:14,919
So we need to find Cicada
before the timeline changes.

51
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,299
Why did it change?

52
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:20,019
Did I screw something up?

53
00:02:20,089 --> 00:02:21,969
No.

54
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,849
No, no.

55
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:28,019
You've done very well,
little runner.

56
00:02:28,029 --> 00:02:32,359
But a new variable is coming,
something big is coming.

57
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,279
Or someone.

58
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,865
<font color="#00FFFF">Synced & corrected by</font> <font color="#D81D1D">MaxPayne</font>

59
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:43,159
Well, it's interesting
that you say that, sir,

60
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,659
since it's your company
that's denying

61
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:46,989
the Robertson family's claim.

62
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:50,119
Yes, of course, I have the
contract right in front of me.

63
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:54,169
And it says that animal attacks

64
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,039
do not fall under Acts of God,

65
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:58,759
and that includes gorillas.

66
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:00,839
The Citizen looks forward
to your statement.

67
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:03,639
Thanks, babe.
Mmhmm.

68
00:03:03,649 --> 00:03:05,229
Are you ready
to do this thing now?

69
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:06,899
Hell yeah,
we just got to find Nora.

70
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:08,389
It's her big day after all.

71
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:09,679
You don't think she's too busy,
do you?

72
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,479
Okay, people, think!

73
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:13,399
We haven't seen Cicada
since the rooftop fight,

74
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,479
which means the only way to
track him down is to figure out

75
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:17,269
who his next meta-human
target's gonna be.

76
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:19,399
Have we double checked
every bank robbery,

77
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,189
every lab break-in?

78
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:23,079
Yes, yes! We have looked
at all of that, all right?

79
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,199
And all the criminals
that are in custody

80
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:26,919
are simply mere mortals.

81
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:28,329
What about the ones
on the street?

82
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:30,159
Frost says that no new metas
have shown up

83
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,789
since Norvock went into witsec.

84
00:03:31,869 --> 00:03:33,419
Are the satellites tracking
for dark matter

85
00:03:33,499 --> 00:03:35,539
or meta-gene bursts
or Element X?

86
00:03:35,619 --> 00:03:36,999
Yes, yes, and yes.

87
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,759
They're scanning for everything.

88
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:40,919
Congratulations,
you raised a menace.

89
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:43,379
Your daughter, so energetic.

90
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:46,679
This is pretty impressive.

91
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:50,599
Um, and I... and I know
with the cure working,

92
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:52,059
we're all ready
to put Cicada to rest,

93
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:53,649
but I'm sure
he'll resurface soon.

94
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:55,349
And then you're going
to give him the chance

95
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:56,819
to take the meta-human cure?

96
00:03:56,899 --> 00:03:57,979
Yes, exactly.

97
00:03:58,059 --> 00:04:00,029
Even Dwyer deserves a choice,

98
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:02,119
we just got to convince him
to do the right thing.

99
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,609
Are you ready?

100
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:05,329
This is gonna be one of
the biggest challenges

101
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:06,779
of your career as a hero.

102
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:08,029
Do you know what
you're going to say?

103
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:14,629
Oh, yeah... you know, yeah.

104
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:17,419
I've... I've got
some loose thoughts.

105
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:19,129
Oh, great.

106
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,049
Well, that instills all of us
with confidence, right?

107
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,969
Loose thoughts?
What are you going to say?

108
00:04:23,049 --> 00:04:25,219
"Hey, most bloodthirsty enemy!
Stop."

109
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:28,599
Guys, it worked for Marlize.

110
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:30,349
Maybe not so much for
Savitar, but...

111
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:33,059
I will figure out 
what to say to him, all right?

112
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,309
I got this.

113
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,229
I know you do, Dad.

114
00:04:36,299 --> 00:04:38,649
Which is why we need to try
everything to try and find him.

115
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:39,689
Okay?

116
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:41,399
Maybe we should go on patrol?

117
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:43,069
Patrol, you say?
What this is, World War II?

118
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:46,029
Oh, wow.
Wow, this is crazy.

119
00:04:46,109 --> 00:04:48,739
There is something nuts
going on at Jitters.

120
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:50,079
Do you think it's a meta-human?

121
00:04:50,149 --> 00:04:51,619
Probably. You should...

122
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:53,789
- We should check it out.
- Yeah.

123
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:54,959
For sure.
Yeah.

124
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:56,329
- Mm-hmm. Y-yeah. Go!
- I'm... oh!

125
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:00,629
- You two did this.
- You made her.

126
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:01,629
You are responsible.

127
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:14,679
Well, well, well.

128
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,519
It is nice to see someone
back at his desk

129
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:19,309
Oh, hey, Foxy.

130
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:21,019
It's good to be back.

131
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,649
After three months of sipping
Wally's Tibetan butter tea,

132
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:26,529
I actually kind of missed
this break room coffee.

133
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:29,069
Ugh. Uh-uh.

134
00:05:29,149 --> 00:05:30,779
Hey, you have any idea
where I can get my hands

135
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,119
on the Cicada task force file?

136
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:33,839
Babe, you're standing in it.

137
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:35,539
What?

138
00:05:35,609 --> 00:05:37,959
I've been trying to catch up
on what I've been missing.

139
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:39,289
Oh.

140
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:41,289
Uh, speaking of which...

141
00:05:41,369 --> 00:05:42,879
you ever seen this woman?

142
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:45,759
Uh, Dr. Vanessa Ambres.

143
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,379
Born and raised in Central City,

144
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:49,629
got her MD from McNider U.

145
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:51,389
Oh, that's interesting.

146
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:53,719
This says she treated
Orlin Dwyer and Grace Gibbons

147
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:55,269
on the night
of the Enlightenment.

148
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,019
Yes, and she has been
treating Grace ever since,

149
00:05:58,099 --> 00:05:59,899
even though she's an ER doctor,

150
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:02,689
and the nurses report
a whole slew of drugs missing

151
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:04,149
from the coma ward.

152
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:05,819
You think
she's working with Dwyer?

153
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:07,749
The guy got stabbed,
struck by lightning.

154
00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:09,489
He's got a hole in his chest.

155
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:11,239
Somebody has got
to be patching him up, right?

156
00:06:11,249 --> 00:06:13,249
I think we should be asking
the doctor a few questions.

157
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:16,659
All right, let's do it.

158
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:18,329
Oh, you want to come with?

159
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:20,049
Yeah, I want to come with.
What?

160
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,629
Uh, yeah, yeah.

161
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:23,589
- Yeah!
- All right, partner.

162
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:25,749
- Partner. I like that.
- Yeah.

163
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:29,429
Okay, I thought something big

164
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:30,879
was supposed to be
going on down here.

165
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,679
Oh, I don't know.
It's pretty big.

166
00:06:32,749 --> 00:06:38,349
Feast your eyes on the newest
addition to the Jitters menu.

167
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:42,519
The XS-presso.

168
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:43,689
I got my own drink!

169
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:45,859
It's pretty schway, right?

170
00:06:45,929 --> 00:06:47,529
Think of what could be next.

171
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:49,739
An XS action figure?
XS Day?

172
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:51,619
Guys, you are embarrassing me.

173
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:53,319
We're just really excited.

174
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,119
I mean, we still haven't
even gone on a trip together

175
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:57,909
or made Grandma Esther's famous
sweet potato pie recipe.

176
00:06:57,989 --> 00:06:59,789
Did you put karaoke
on the list like I asked?

177
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:01,039
I think so, actually.

178
00:07:01,049 --> 00:07:02,379
Just a sec... let me see this.

179
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:07,089
Okay, there are so many things
on this list.

180
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:08,459
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, I mean, we've got time.

181
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:12,259
Okay, is that a real alert
or another fake one?

182
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:13,259
No, this one's real.

183
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:14,769
M-20 at CCU,
Chemistry Department.

184
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:16,809
- A meta attack.
- Yeah, let's go. Come on.

185
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:24,149
Been a while
since high school chem,

186
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,819
but that does not look like
proper lab safety.

187
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:30,609
I need this!
Leave me alone!

188
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:40,499
Sodium bicarbonate
neutralizes any acid.

189
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:42,409
You have the cuffs?

190
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:52,519
Let's go get him.

191
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:54,349
- We don't need to.
- What?

192
00:07:54,429 --> 00:07:55,979
Look at this burn mark.

193
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:00,849
That acid guy, he...
He must've been there

194
00:08:00,859 --> 00:08:01,929
when the photo was taken.

195
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:03,779
What are you talking about?

196
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:07,649
Dad, today's the day
you stop Cicada.

197
00:08:13,636 --> 00:08:15,625
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down. Say that again?

198
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:17,674
There's a photo,
it's in The Flash museum,

199
00:08:17,675 --> 00:08:19,675
of Flash and Cicada... the last
time they were ever seen

200
00:08:19,745 --> 00:08:23,272
confronting each other in public,
and in the photo, by Flash's feet,

201
00:08:23,273 --> 00:08:26,533
the exact same burn mark left
by the meta that we just fought.

202
00:08:26,613 --> 00:08:29,636
This acid meta was at
their final confrontation?

203
00:08:29,637 --> 00:08:31,486
He must be
Cicada's final target.

204
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,443
His final target before I vanish
and he starts killing again.

205
00:08:34,443 --> 00:08:37,583
Why is Nora just telling us
about this crucial meta now?

206
00:08:37,663 --> 00:08:42,503
Because a lot of the stuff
from my timeline is unreliable.

207
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:45,633
You know, uh, different metas,
different victims, different circumstances.

208
00:08:45,713 --> 00:08:48,640
But this time,
everything's exactly the same.

209
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:49,273
So far.

210
00:08:49,274 --> 00:08:51,284
If Cicada goes
after this acid meta,

211
00:08:51,294 --> 00:08:53,294
that means that today's
the last day

212
00:08:53,374 --> 00:08:54,754
we're going to confront him.

213
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,134
And our last chance to stop him.

214
00:08:57,214 --> 00:08:59,924
Yeah, all right, well, then,
I gotta figure out exactly

215
00:08:59,994 --> 00:09:01,474
what I'm gonna say to him.

216
00:09:01,554 --> 00:09:03,384
You'll find the words, Dad.
I'll help you.

217
00:09:03,464 --> 00:09:05,384
And I am going to start
working on facial rec

218
00:09:05,464 --> 00:09:06,764
for this Acid Master.

219
00:09:06,834 --> 00:09:08,054
Yup, that's what I'm going with.

220
00:09:08,134 --> 00:09:09,984
Always trust your gut, kids.

221
00:09:10,054 --> 00:09:12,054
And we'll figure out a way
for you to talk to Cicada

222
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,654
without him killing you.

223
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,394
Well...

224
00:09:19,474 --> 00:09:22,314
if it all works out, then...

225
00:09:22,324 --> 00:09:26,114
looks like today could be
the end of our journey.

226
00:09:26,194 --> 00:09:28,204
Yeah.

227
00:09:28,284 --> 00:09:30,414
And I guess
everyone starts moving on.

228
00:09:34,534 --> 00:09:36,844
Nora.
Oh, hey, Mom.

229
00:09:36,914 --> 00:09:39,014
Um, look, I've really gotta
hurry and go help Dad.

230
00:09:39,084 --> 00:09:40,674
Yeah, I know, it's just...

231
00:09:40,684 --> 00:09:43,014
I guess you might be
going home tomorrow.

232
00:09:43,094 --> 00:09:44,964
Yeah, I guess so.
Um, mission accomplished.

233
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:47,634
Well, if you two need
a break after a while,

234
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:50,434
Papa Joe taught me the famous
West family right hook.

235
00:09:50,504 --> 00:09:52,144
I-I would love to teach you.

236
00:09:53,764 --> 00:09:55,644
Nora?
Sorry, uh, sorry, Mom.

237
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:58,024
I just, uh, thought of something

238
00:09:58,034 --> 00:10:00,234
that's going to help Dad...
I-I got to go.

239
00:10:04,724 --> 00:10:06,694
Babe, this is a first!

240
00:10:06,704 --> 00:10:08,444
We've worked together before.

241
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,874
We have, Detective,

242
00:10:09,954 --> 00:10:12,204
but anytime we did anything
even close to this,

243
00:10:12,214 --> 00:10:14,374
I didn't have my abilities.

244
00:10:16,794 --> 00:10:18,544
Okay, here we go.

245
00:10:18,554 --> 00:10:22,374
Uh, if I fiddle with my ring,
you know,

246
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:24,174
assume that means she's lying

247
00:10:24,244 --> 00:10:26,464
and then you just get in there
and, mm, mm,

248
00:10:26,544 --> 00:10:27,674
do your thing.

249
00:10:27,684 --> 00:10:28,934
You cop it up.

250
00:10:30,634 --> 00:10:33,314
Prednisone, sirolimus,
abatacept.

251
00:10:33,394 --> 00:10:35,644
All drugs classified
as immunosuppressants.

252
00:10:35,714 --> 00:10:38,404
They also happen to have
all been reported stolen

253
00:10:38,484 --> 00:10:39,684
from this facility.

254
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,734
I'm aware of the report.

255
00:10:40,744 --> 00:10:42,074
What I'm wondering

256
00:10:42,154 --> 00:10:43,654
is why it warrants the interest
of the DA?

257
00:10:43,724 --> 00:10:45,234
We believe
that the missing medications

258
00:10:45,314 --> 00:10:47,574
are connected
to a much higher profile case.

259
00:10:47,654 --> 00:10:49,404
Orlin Dwyer.

260
00:10:49,414 --> 00:10:51,534
Grace Gibbons' uncle.

261
00:10:51,604 --> 00:10:54,414
Is he still at large?
I don't really watch the news.

262
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:58,414
Yes, he's very much at large.

263
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,544
And we have reason to believe
that those exact medications

264
00:11:01,614 --> 00:11:03,764
are the ones that Dwyer would
need to treat his injuries.

265
00:11:03,834 --> 00:11:05,094
What are you saying exactly?

266
00:11:05,174 --> 00:11:07,674
The records of the stolen meds

267
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:10,594
continued after Dwyer stopped
visiting the hospital.

268
00:11:10,604 --> 00:11:12,514
Which means that someone here

269
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:14,344
may be still supplying them
to him.

270
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,224
Sounds like a good theory,

271
00:11:16,304 --> 00:11:17,724
but I don't know
who that could be.

272
00:11:17,804 --> 00:11:19,934
Everything I know
is in those reports.

273
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,894
Okay, okay.

274
00:11:24,974 --> 00:11:26,274
That's enough for now.

275
00:11:26,354 --> 00:11:28,114
Thank you very much
for your time.

276
00:11:28,124 --> 00:11:30,364
Of course.

277
00:11:30,374 --> 00:11:31,914
What are you doing?

278
00:11:31,994 --> 00:11:33,654
You're just gonna let her
walk away like that?

279
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,574
I-I didn't want to scare her.

280
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:38,004
We don't have enough evidence.
We don't even have a motive.

281
00:11:38,084 --> 00:11:41,124
So, then, let me
keep doing my thing!

282
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,964
I'm not used to going
into an interview

283
00:11:43,044 --> 00:11:45,044
factoring in
your meta-abilities.

284
00:11:45,124 --> 00:11:46,804
I-I'm used to going in
using my gut.

285
00:11:46,884 --> 00:11:48,714
What about my gut?

286
00:11:48,794 --> 00:11:51,964
All due respect,
this isn't about your gut.

287
00:11:51,974 --> 00:11:53,474
Huh.

288
00:11:53,484 --> 00:11:55,144
Look, Cecile,
what I meant to say was...

289
00:11:55,224 --> 00:11:56,634
No, no, no, no, no, no, Joe.

290
00:11:56,654 --> 00:11:58,484
You said exactly what you meant,

291
00:11:58,564 --> 00:12:00,314
and you know what, right now,

292
00:12:00,324 --> 00:12:02,814
I'm about to say
something that I mean.

293
00:12:02,824 --> 00:12:05,274
Maybe we shouldn't be working
on this together after all.

294
00:12:07,664 --> 00:12:08,994
Oh, man.

295
00:12:09,074 --> 00:12:10,614
<i>Okay, the clock's ticking,</i>

296
00:12:10,684 --> 00:12:12,574
and we have no clue
how to convince Cicada

297
00:12:12,644 --> 00:12:13,824
to take the cure,

298
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:16,114
but we still have
our best weapon.

299
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,494
- Your journal.
- Your legacy.

300
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,284
One of the biggest things
history remembers

301
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,914
about The Flash is your ability

302
00:12:21,924 --> 00:12:24,004
to change people's
hearts and minds,

303
00:12:24,014 --> 00:12:25,964
especially your enemy's,

304
00:12:26,034 --> 00:12:28,004
and I have dozens of entries
about those times.

305
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:29,834
Any chance you've got
the future words

306
00:12:29,854 --> 00:12:31,344
I say to Cicada in there?

307
00:12:31,424 --> 00:12:33,674
Nope,
but I have your past words.

308
00:12:33,684 --> 00:12:37,094
Magenta, she wanted to drop
an oil tanker on a hospital,

309
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:39,194
but you convinced her
she was a good person.

310
00:12:39,264 --> 00:12:42,314
You said, "Use that good
to beat the bad."

311
00:12:42,384 --> 00:12:45,024
Magenta had split personalities.

312
00:12:45,034 --> 00:12:47,144
She literally had a good side
and a bad side.

313
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,984
That's not gonna work
with Cicada.

314
00:12:49,064 --> 00:12:50,444
Leonard Snart,

315
00:12:50,524 --> 00:12:52,194
he said he didn't want
to be saved

316
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:55,204
and you still found a way to
convince him to save himself.

317
00:12:55,284 --> 00:12:56,824
"There's a part of you
that knows

318
00:12:56,904 --> 00:12:58,784
you don't have to let
your past define you."

319
00:12:58,864 --> 00:13:02,994
Except Snart had already
worked with us at that point.

320
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:06,504
Killer Frost,
you dared her to kill you.

321
00:13:06,574 --> 00:13:08,544
"Come on, live up to your name,
Killer Frost!"

322
00:13:08,624 --> 00:13:10,004
And what did she do?
Nora.

323
00:13:10,084 --> 00:13:11,894
Amunet, Plastique,
the list goes on and on.

324
00:13:11,964 --> 00:13:15,964
Nora, all... all of these times
are... are different.

325
00:13:16,044 --> 00:13:19,134
Cicada doesn't even care
if he lives when this is over.

326
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:22,404
What am I supposed to say
that he'll care about?

327
00:13:22,474 --> 00:13:25,814
You'll know.
The Flash always knows.

328
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:35,244
So, when you think about it,
an anti-dampening array

329
00:13:35,324 --> 00:13:36,914
is the way to stop him
in his tracks.

330
00:13:36,994 --> 00:13:39,084
Sherloque, are you happy
to be going home soon?

331
00:13:39,164 --> 00:13:40,574
Of course I'm happy to go back.

332
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,754
I just feel that...

333
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:44,914
somehow there's more work
to be done here.

334
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:48,084
I think he's, uh,
talking about his lady friend.

335
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:51,214
You know, I have a bit
of experience with these, uh,

336
00:13:51,284 --> 00:13:53,004
long-distance relationships.

337
00:13:53,084 --> 00:13:55,504
I got one word for you:
Holo-cube.

338
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,264
These things work wonders.

339
00:13:57,344 --> 00:13:59,604
And I request that you stop
speaking possibly forever.

340
00:13:59,684 --> 00:14:01,934
I can deduce from your
conversation when you came in

341
00:14:01,944 --> 00:14:04,644
that you have indeed tracked
down Cicada's next target

342
00:14:04,714 --> 00:14:06,764
but do need help
facilitating the conversation

343
00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:08,024
between Cicada and The Flash.

344
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:09,444
Correct? Yes?
Oh, good.

345
00:14:09,524 --> 00:14:11,314
Come with me and I will
give you the solution.

346
00:14:11,394 --> 00:14:13,104
When did you figure it out?

347
00:14:17,364 --> 00:14:19,624
I will miss you both very much.

348
00:14:21,614 --> 00:14:23,624
But you will miss me more!
<i>Allez!</i>

349
00:14:26,944 --> 00:14:28,794
Philip Master!

350
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:51,394
We good?

351
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,364
Yes, Philip Master is secure
in the pipeline.

352
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:57,824
Wait, Acid Master's real name
is Philip Master?

353
00:14:57,834 --> 00:15:01,074
This is it.
Just like in the photo.

354
00:15:01,154 --> 00:15:04,244
The last confrontation
between Flash and Cicada.

355
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:10,754
Oh, what's the matter?

356
00:15:10,824 --> 00:15:12,664
You don't have one of these?

357
00:15:14,084 --> 00:15:15,384
Bye-bye.

358
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,674
Cicada!

359
00:15:25,354 --> 00:15:27,304
How long does he have?

360
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,764
He has to hold that dagger
for 60 seconds, maybe less.

361
00:15:29,844 --> 00:15:32,024
Flash better figure out
what he's going to say fast.

362
00:15:32,034 --> 00:15:34,104
He will. I know he will.

363
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:35,814
I don't want to fight.

364
00:15:37,934 --> 00:15:39,824
We have a cure.

365
00:15:39,894 --> 00:15:42,324
What are you talking about?

366
00:15:42,404 --> 00:15:45,664
We have a way
to cure meta-humans.

367
00:15:45,734 --> 00:15:48,494
We have a way to take
their powers away.

368
00:15:50,294 --> 00:15:51,874
We want you to take it.

369
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:55,884
And why would I agree
to do that?

370
00:16:03,064 --> 00:16:04,474
Your legacy.

371
00:16:06,064 --> 00:16:08,404
<i>I know how this ends.</i>

372
00:16:08,474 --> 00:16:10,734
You keep killing,

373
00:16:10,814 --> 00:16:13,984
and you're remembered
as a monster, not a hero.

374
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:15,814
But we can change that together,

375
00:16:15,894 --> 00:16:18,024
you can have a different legacy.

376
00:16:18,104 --> 00:16:19,734
You just have to choose it.

377
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:39,584
I don't give a damn
about my legacy.

378
00:16:59,024 --> 00:17:02,274
That was it.
That was our last chance.

379
00:17:13,972 --> 00:17:16,769
We ran citywide
facial recognition scans

380
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,320
and scanned
for dark matter signals

381
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,900
from Cicada's dagger.

382
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,530
That was our last shot
at confronting Cicada.

383
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:22,990
We don't know that.

384
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,580
We're changing the timeline.

385
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,240
That photo that Nora saw
at the Flash museum,

386
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,420
it could be different now.

387
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,660
Maybe it doesn't even exist.

388
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:33,130
After all...
the timeline is malleable.

389
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,090
I just don't understand
why our plan didn't work.

390
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,510
Yeah, you guys
did everything right.

391
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,590
The only reason it didn't work

392
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,930
is because
I couldn't convince him.

393
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,890
Dad, you're the Flash.

394
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,610
When the Flash speaks honestly
from his heart, people listen.

395
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,310
Not all people.

396
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,600
Let's keep searching.

397
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:54,060
I'm gonna check
the Cicada files at CCPD.

398
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,820
See if I missed anything.

399
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,450
Nora.

400
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,530
We just... we just
need to create

401
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,570
another window
of opportunity, okay?

402
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,540
Dad couldn't convince Cicada
to take the cure.

403
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:11,340
He just... he just needs
to find the right words.

404
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,460
Bare.

405
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,310
What are you doing here so late?

406
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,720
We hit a wall at S.T.A.R.
Labs tracking Cicada.

407
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,760
Thought a change of scenery
would help, but...

408
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,560
Keep your head up, man.

409
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,480
We'll find him.
We always do.

410
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,660
Honestly, I'm more worried
about what happens when we do.

411
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:40,940
Our whole plan depends on me
being able to convince Dwyer

412
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,570
to just take the cure.

413
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,610
The last time I tried...

414
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,910
I don't think I've ever
struck out so hard.

415
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,450
Wow, that's saying a lot

416
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,340
considering your track record
at the plate.

417
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,670
Wait, what exactly
did you say to him?

418
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,460
That he was creating
a legacy of fear,

419
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,340
one that would go down
in history,

420
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:08,010
but that we could work together
to change that.

421
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,770
That sounds like
something the Flash would say.

422
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,140
Well, I am the Flash.

423
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,690
Look, that man's a zealot.

424
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,190
He sees you in that suit

425
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,650
and all he sees
is the thing he hates.

426
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,030
Meta-human, superpowers,

427
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,690
the thing that took his niece
away from him.

428
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,700
He can't see past the Flash,

429
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,360
but what he doesn't know...

430
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,370
There's a whole lot
more to you than that.

431
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,880
Be more Barry Allen.
Human.

432
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,830
Yeah, you're right.

433
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,790
Thanks.
I'm gonna dive back in.

434
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,630
I'll let you get back
to running down Ambres.

435
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,550
Actually...

436
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,670
me and Cecile ran
into a wall ourselves.

437
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,390
We are... uh, she... like,
working together.

438
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:50,010
I mean, ever since
she got her powers,

439
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:53,930
it's like she's
a human lie detector.

440
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,150
How is that a bad thing?

441
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,060
You know I've always
prided myself

442
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,770
on being able to read people,
right?

443
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:04,860
But Cecile and these powers,
I mean, she puts me to shame.

444
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,240
Well, you just got to remember

445
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,580
that you guys are a team.

446
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,410
That makes her strengths
your strengths

447
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,750
and yours hers.

448
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,250
So if you let her
do what she's great at,

449
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,080
it's only going to
create more room

450
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,910
for you to do more of what
you're great at too, right?

451
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,090
Well, damn.

452
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,100
You're getting real good
at these pep talks, Bare.

453
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,550
Well, I had
a pretty good teacher.

454
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,850
Hey, Nora.

455
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:37,940
Hi, Nora.

456
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,490
Yeah.

457
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,110
Do you want to turn
that down a little bit?

458
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,160
Hmm? Oh, sorry.

459
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,940
What are you listening to?

460
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,030
Sped-up archives
of the Flash's comm recordings.

461
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,860
I thought that if I listen
to his best appeals,

462
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,200
I could figure out
what exactly worked so well.

463
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,910
And did you?

464
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,410
No, not yet.

465
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,460
But if I run the transcripts
through the computer,

466
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,620
I can extrapolate
recurring key words

467
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,290
from his most successful appeals

468
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,380
and create a sort of
"best of speeches" speech.

469
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,630
Well, um,

470
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,720
why don't you let your dad
think about it

471
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,300
and we could go
to the rooftop of Jitters.

472
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,470
It's a great place
to clear your mind,

473
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,980
plus it's got the best views
of the city.

474
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,890
You want to go sightseeing?
Right now?

475
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,850
What... is this from
that list of yours?

476
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,990
Well, yeah, but...

477
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,650
All day I've been trying
to figure out a way

478
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,320
to stop Cicada

479
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,940
and all day you've been
trying to pull me away.

480
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,610
Why are you pushing this list?

481
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,070
I mean, it's just the last time

482
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,670
that we may get
to spend together.

483
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,830
Nora, I mean,
once we stop Cicada,

484
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,380
you'll go back to your time
and...

485
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:46,390
Us like this together will end.

486
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,850
Mom, it doesn't end.

487
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,590
We have our whole future
together.

488
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,470
Yeah, for you it'll feel
like no time has passed

489
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:56,020
but for me,
it'll be decades before I...

490
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,180
see you like this again.

491
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,310
Uh, no, it's okay.

492
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:08,660
Um, I will catch up
with you later.

493
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,450
Joe.

494
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,450
What's going on?

495
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,940
Why'd you want me
to meet you here?

496
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,130
Look, I know the last time
we tried to work together

497
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,540
went a bit south.

498
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,000
Oh, a bit?

499
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,460
You're right.
I'm sorry, Cecile.

500
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,510
I let my pride get in the way,

501
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,970
and I didn't lean
on your strengths

502
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,890
when I should have.

503
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,850
But you know me,

504
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,390
I'm not a man who makes
the same mistake twice.

505
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,560
So...

506
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,410
Would you do me the honor

507
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,320
of joining me
in this interrogation?

508
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,200
You do what you do best,
I'll take care of the rest.

509
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,260
Get 'em, girl.

510
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,670
Detective. DA.

511
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,500
This is starting to border
on harassment.

512
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,340
I have told you
everything I know.

513
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,170
That's not true.

514
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,550
We know that you've been
funneling meds to Orlin Dwyer.

515
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,100
Well, if you knew that,

516
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,890
then I'd be arrested
and not sitting here.

517
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,850
Let me correct myself.

518
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:26,940
We have a strong hunch,

519
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,560
but I bet if we were
to go through

520
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,860
the video camera footage
from the hospital,

521
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,950
we'll find proof
that you were assisting Dwyer.

522
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,530
I'm a doctor.

523
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,620
I mean, why would I condone
a vigilante murderer?

524
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,950
Because of what happened
to Darius.

525
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,500
Darius.

526
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:49,040
It hurts you
to even think about it.

527
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,300
My fiancé was killed
by meta-humans

528
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,590
during Zoom's rampage.

529
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,310
So, yes, it hurts
to think about him.

530
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:58,260
Hurt enough for you to help
Dwyer kill other meta-humans?

531
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,970
Correct me if I'm wrong,

532
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,650
you took an oath to do no harm,
right?

533
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,640
Can you truthfully say
you've upheld that oath?

534
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,990
That guilt that you feel
right now?

535
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,980
There's a way to make up for it.

536
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:15,780
All you have to do
is help us find Orlin.

537
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,320
What, so... so you can put him
in jail? Kill him?

538
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,070
No, so we can cure him.

539
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,660
It's not possible.

540
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,660
Maybe not with the medicine
you've been giving him,

541
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,950
but S.T.A.R. Labs
has created a treatment

542
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:30,330
that turns metas back
into normal human beings.

543
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,760
I can't take you to him.

544
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:37,380
Okay, okay,
then help us set up a meet.

545
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,550
Look, Dr. Ambres, it's clear.

546
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,140
You've come to truly care
for Dwyer.

547
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:45,430
So we're asking you now...

548
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,600
help us save his life.

549
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,280
I can make contact,
and I can share the location.

550
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,370
I have rounds in an hour

551
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,200
and patients
that I can save tonight.

552
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,950
So am I free to go, please?

553
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,630
I love my job.

554
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,170
I can stay here all night.

555
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:21,890
And we will, unless you tell us
what you're keeping hidden

556
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,430
right now.

557
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,400
Yo, yo. I got your text.
You talked to Ambres?

558
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,520
Cecile and I together
got through to her.

559
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,150
She's going to show us
where to find Dwyer.

560
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,740
Joe, that's amazing.

561
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,750
Yeah, Ambres told us
something else.

562
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:43,320
Dwyer's niece, Grace?
She's a meta.

563
00:25:50,598 --> 00:25:52,825
So le petit Dwyer is a meta.

564
00:25:52,827 --> 00:25:55,677
Wait, I thought we scanned
Grace for meta powers

565
00:25:55,677 --> 00:25:56,816
when Nora entered her brain.

566
00:25:56,817 --> 00:25:59,444
We did but that was back
when her DNA was 100% human.

567
00:25:59,514 --> 00:26:00,974
Her powers must have activated

568
00:26:01,054 --> 00:26:02,774
in just the last few weeks,
right?

569
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:06,104
Yeah, Ambres told Joe
that the wound in Grace's head

570
00:26:06,114 --> 00:26:08,104
recently started glowing
and mutating.

571
00:26:08,114 --> 00:26:12,864
Now all we need to do is get
Dwyer to listen to you, again.

572
00:26:12,934 --> 00:26:15,454
Killer Frost can put him
on ice from the neck down.

573
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:18,074
Better yet, I can re-sequence
the Speed Force Bazooka

574
00:26:18,154 --> 00:26:19,574
to overload him
with negative tachyons.

575
00:26:19,654 --> 00:26:21,534
- Yes. Absolutely.
- So that he's stuck there...

576
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:23,454
Tachyon, shmack-yon.
No, no. La Machine à Mémoire!

577
00:26:23,464 --> 00:26:24,744
We could go inside Dwyer's mind.

578
00:26:27,174 --> 00:26:29,624
- Guys...
- No, La Machine à Mémoire!

579
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:32,134
Guys, hey!

580
00:26:32,144 --> 00:26:34,554
I appreciate the enthusiasm,

581
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:37,814
but I think we need to take
a different approach.

582
00:26:37,884 --> 00:26:42,264
No powers, no crazy plans.

583
00:26:42,274 --> 00:26:44,474
The Flash can't convince
Cicada to stop this,

584
00:26:44,484 --> 00:26:47,984
but... maybe...

585
00:26:47,994 --> 00:26:49,994
I can.

586
00:26:53,574 --> 00:26:55,444
- Hey.
- Hey.

587
00:26:55,524 --> 00:26:56,834
Dad's back.

588
00:26:56,904 --> 00:26:59,364
He says Papa Joe's
got news about Dwyer.

589
00:26:59,444 --> 00:27:02,424
Okay, good. I guess we should
get over to the Cortex.

590
00:27:03,844 --> 00:27:05,384
You know, I had a list too.

591
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:10,874
Your wedding,
Auntie Jenna's baby shower,

592
00:27:10,884 --> 00:27:14,004
Jitters, The Enlightenment.

593
00:27:17,924 --> 00:27:20,094
Those were all
the moments in time

594
00:27:20,174 --> 00:27:21,764
you wanted to go back
and see us?

595
00:27:21,844 --> 00:27:24,564
Yeah, so I could have
memories and experiences

596
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:26,684
with all of you.

597
00:27:26,764 --> 00:27:28,194
I get it.

598
00:27:28,274 --> 00:27:32,104
I should've been sensitive
and I-I'm so sorry.

599
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:35,034
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

600
00:27:35,114 --> 00:27:38,364
I was so focused on making sure
Flash beat Cicada,

601
00:27:38,374 --> 00:27:43,364
I forgot what I was supposed
to really be focused on.

602
00:27:43,444 --> 00:27:46,164
You and Dad.

603
00:27:46,244 --> 00:27:49,124
You're the reason
I came back to this time,

604
00:27:49,204 --> 00:27:53,844
not fighting big bads
or getting my own XS-presso.

605
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:57,344
So that I could spend time
with my parents.

606
00:27:57,354 --> 00:27:59,964
My family.

607
00:28:00,044 --> 00:28:02,394
I don't know how much time
we have left together

608
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:05,644
or how much of your list
we're going to get done,

609
00:28:05,714 --> 00:28:09,814
but from now on,
every moment we have left,

610
00:28:09,884 --> 00:28:11,574
we're going to make it
a memorable one.

611
00:28:11,644 --> 00:28:12,984
I promise.

612
00:28:19,484 --> 00:28:22,694
Well, I guess we can cross off
"hugging while drinking tea"

613
00:28:22,774 --> 00:28:24,494
off our list.
Yeah.

614
00:28:24,574 --> 00:28:27,374
Hey, guys, sorry to interrupt.

615
00:28:27,444 --> 00:28:29,594
No, it's fine.
We were just...

616
00:28:29,664 --> 00:28:31,844
We were just talking about
Mom's list.

617
00:28:33,764 --> 00:28:36,424
Um, so I heard Dad
has a lead on Dwyer?

618
00:28:36,434 --> 00:28:38,214
We have a location.

619
00:28:38,294 --> 00:28:39,754
I'm going to head there
any minute.

620
00:28:39,764 --> 00:28:42,684
Does Flash know what
he's going to say this time?

621
00:28:44,594 --> 00:28:48,434
Actually, I think
I'm just gonna talk to him,

622
00:28:48,444 --> 00:28:50,614
father to father.

623
00:28:50,684 --> 00:28:52,604
That's a really good idea, Dad.

624
00:29:06,534 --> 00:29:08,214
Hey, Doc.

625
00:29:10,614 --> 00:29:13,874
Dr. Ambres told us
where to find you.

626
00:29:14,994 --> 00:29:16,294
I just want to talk.

627
00:29:16,304 --> 00:29:20,644
There's no more talking.

628
00:29:20,714 --> 00:29:25,884
Every time one of you metas
comes near the rest of us,

629
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:28,644
good people get hurt.

630
00:29:28,654 --> 00:29:31,764
This is what you all deserve.

631
00:29:31,844 --> 00:29:33,774
Does that include Grace?

632
00:29:36,064 --> 00:29:39,194
Ambres hasn't told you.

633
00:29:39,264 --> 00:29:42,774
Grace. She's a meta.

634
00:29:42,854 --> 00:29:45,084
The night the satellite crashed,

635
00:29:45,154 --> 00:29:47,074
she was hit
with a piece of shrapnel

636
00:29:47,154 --> 00:29:48,334
inflected with dark matter.

637
00:29:48,414 --> 00:29:50,824
That's... that's why
she's in a coma,

638
00:29:50,844 --> 00:29:53,124
and now it's changing her.

639
00:29:53,204 --> 00:29:55,344
That's a lie.

640
00:29:55,414 --> 00:29:57,834
And that's why Ambres
told us where to find you.

641
00:29:57,844 --> 00:29:59,294
She's afraid.

642
00:29:59,374 --> 00:30:00,844
She's afraid you're going
to do the one thing

643
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,294
you can't come back from.

644
00:30:07,294 --> 00:30:11,694
I know how much you care
about Grace.

645
00:30:11,764 --> 00:30:14,474
You're trying to make the world
a better place for her.

646
00:30:14,554 --> 00:30:17,434
She didn't choose to be a meta,

647
00:30:17,514 --> 00:30:19,274
but she is.

648
00:30:19,354 --> 00:30:21,654
Does that mean
she deserves to die?

649
00:30:21,724 --> 00:30:23,984
No.

650
00:30:24,064 --> 00:30:27,374
I would never hurt Grace.

651
00:30:27,454 --> 00:30:30,044
Then you'd let her grow up
in a world of fear.

652
00:30:30,124 --> 00:30:33,424
Where there's someone out there
hurting people like her.

653
00:30:35,424 --> 00:30:39,514
The cure,
it will heal Grace and you.

654
00:30:50,214 --> 00:30:54,144
And why should
I believe you, Flash?

655
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:06,244
Because I'm a father too.

656
00:31:06,324 --> 00:31:08,414
My daughter,

657
00:31:08,494 --> 00:31:13,244
I love her more than
I ever thought possible.

658
00:31:13,254 --> 00:31:16,834
I would do anything to make the
world a better place for her.

659
00:31:20,124 --> 00:31:21,874
And I think you would too.

660
00:31:25,624 --> 00:31:27,054
So do it.

661
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:42,806
We made an arrangement.

662
00:31:42,876 --> 00:31:45,806
We cure him and then Grace.

663
00:31:45,886 --> 00:31:47,196
Okay.

664
00:31:47,266 --> 00:31:51,406
Why are we here
and not at a hospital?

665
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:55,236
We have to be sure
that the cure is successful.

666
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,776
We created it.

667
00:31:56,786 --> 00:31:58,526
We're the ones who know
how it works.

668
00:31:58,606 --> 00:32:01,656
Once administered,
the cure will take 60 seconds

669
00:32:01,736 --> 00:32:04,496
to eliminate the meta-human
powers in your system.

670
00:32:04,576 --> 00:32:07,746
That means the wound
in your chest will then open.

671
00:32:07,756 --> 00:32:10,746
You'll need me to suture it
shut so you don't bleed out.

672
00:32:10,826 --> 00:32:13,926
- Why not Doc Ambres?
- She's being held for questioning.

673
00:32:14,006 --> 00:32:18,756
No, it's Ambres, or we're done.

674
00:32:23,126 --> 00:32:24,716
All right, we'll get her.

675
00:32:24,796 --> 00:32:27,346
If anything goes wrong,

676
00:32:27,426 --> 00:32:29,726
or if you're lying to me,

677
00:32:29,806 --> 00:32:34,526
I'll kill every... last...

678
00:32:34,596 --> 00:32:36,696
one of you.

679
00:32:40,906 --> 00:32:43,446
And we're certain everything
in this room is sterile?

680
00:32:43,456 --> 00:32:45,796
Of course.

681
00:32:45,866 --> 00:32:47,626
Everything except that.

682
00:32:49,986 --> 00:32:52,746
That thing's not negotiable.

683
00:32:57,456 --> 00:32:59,676
That rage of his, it's...

684
00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:02,886
Joe, I can't.

685
00:33:02,956 --> 00:33:03,926
Are you going to stay?

686
00:33:04,006 --> 00:33:06,266
Uh, yeah, just in case.

687
00:33:06,336 --> 00:33:09,276
- Okay.
- All right, babe.

688
00:33:09,346 --> 00:33:10,636
Good job today.

689
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,816
You too. Partner.

690
00:33:18,686 --> 00:33:21,446
We never could have done this
without you guys.

691
00:33:21,516 --> 00:33:23,116
Well, I'm glad it worked out,

692
00:33:23,186 --> 00:33:26,286
but when this is over,
he's going to jail,

693
00:33:26,356 --> 00:33:28,616
for a long time.

694
00:33:30,416 --> 00:33:34,916
Okay, one fresh serving
of piping hot meta-human cure.

695
00:33:34,996 --> 00:33:36,836
I'm just supposed to trust
that that thing works?

696
00:33:36,846 --> 00:33:39,096
Has it gone through
any human testing?

697
00:33:39,176 --> 00:33:41,126
It's gone through
giant shark testing.

698
00:33:43,056 --> 00:33:44,506
It's a long story.

699
00:33:46,596 --> 00:33:48,926
It's okay, Doc.

700
00:33:49,006 --> 00:33:51,356
I wanted to tell you
the truth about Grace.

701
00:33:51,436 --> 00:33:54,226
I just couldn't find the words.

702
00:33:54,306 --> 00:33:57,606
You were just trying
to keep her safe.

703
00:33:57,676 --> 00:34:00,026
I'll always be thankful
for that.

704
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:06,526
See you on the other side.

705
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:20,456
There we go.

706
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:27,546
Injecting the cure.

707
00:34:49,736 --> 00:34:50,866
His vitals are spiking.

708
00:34:50,946 --> 00:34:52,576
How can we tell
if the cure is even working?

709
00:34:52,586 --> 00:34:54,756
Oh, it's working.

710
00:35:05,786 --> 00:35:07,546
My powers are back.

711
00:35:07,626 --> 00:35:09,676
Which means Dwyer's powers
must be gone.

712
00:35:13,966 --> 00:35:16,726
Well...

713
00:35:16,806 --> 00:35:20,946
It appears your sojourn into the
past was a success. Congratulations.

714
00:35:21,026 --> 00:35:22,606
Thank you.

715
00:35:22,686 --> 00:35:25,566
You as well.
It's your, uh, 38th Cicada?

716
00:35:25,646 --> 00:35:27,286
That's right, yes.

717
00:35:27,366 --> 00:35:28,696
38th Cicada.
Trente-huit Cicada.

718
00:35:28,776 --> 00:35:30,076
Alley-oop!

719
00:35:30,146 --> 00:35:32,116
But, of course,
there's some business here

720
00:35:32,126 --> 00:35:33,866
that remains unfinished.

721
00:35:33,946 --> 00:35:36,416
For instance, how did you know
before you saw the burn marks

722
00:35:36,486 --> 00:35:38,966
in the photograph
that it was a meta-human

723
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:41,296
that would lead us to Cicada?

724
00:35:41,366 --> 00:35:43,706
Uh, I...

725
00:35:43,786 --> 00:35:45,256
You know, I just had
this feeling

726
00:35:45,326 --> 00:35:47,436
that something big was coming.

727
00:35:49,206 --> 00:35:51,136
They're working on him now.

728
00:35:51,146 --> 00:35:54,216
I will be so happy
when this is all over with.

729
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:10,996
What's going on?

730
00:36:11,076 --> 00:36:12,736
What happened to the power?

731
00:36:12,816 --> 00:36:15,326
I have no idea.

732
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:16,546
I should check the Med Lab.

733
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:19,916
Someone's coming.
Who?

734
00:36:33,216 --> 00:36:34,806
Cicada?

735
00:37:00,896 --> 00:37:02,906
Where's that coming from?

736
00:37:02,986 --> 00:37:04,326
Cisco!

737
00:37:04,406 --> 00:37:05,786
- Hold on!
- Iris.

738
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:07,916
- Careful.
- I can't see anything.

739
00:37:07,996 --> 00:37:09,576
Here.

740
00:37:09,656 --> 00:37:11,086
Cisco, we need power.

741
00:37:11,156 --> 00:37:12,706
We got a much bigger problem.

742
00:37:14,006 --> 00:37:15,296
Cicada?

743
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:17,006
How the hell did that happen?

744
00:37:17,016 --> 00:37:18,256
I don't know,
but he's coming here

745
00:37:18,266 --> 00:37:19,386
and he looks pissed.

746
00:37:19,456 --> 00:37:20,676
We have to move now.

747
00:37:20,746 --> 00:37:22,046
I've got to keep
patching him up.

748
00:37:22,066 --> 00:37:23,306
Stand back.

749
00:37:32,346 --> 00:37:34,486
There.

750
00:37:34,566 --> 00:37:38,026
- He's in the hallway.
- Get the hell out of here.

751
00:38:41,996 --> 00:38:43,506
Iris! Get down!

752
00:39:18,796 --> 00:39:20,456
Come on!

753
00:39:28,046 --> 00:39:29,716
Who are you?

754
00:39:33,356 --> 00:39:37,356
Please, whoever you are.

755
00:39:37,426 --> 00:39:39,816
I only came here
to make him human again!

756
00:39:39,886 --> 00:39:41,906
I helped him!

757
00:40:01,576 --> 00:40:04,216
Please!

758
00:40:04,286 --> 00:40:06,266
Please don't do this!

759
00:40:23,306 --> 00:40:26,406
Nope. They're all toast.

760
00:40:26,476 --> 00:40:28,026
Well, better the computers
than us.

761
00:40:28,106 --> 00:40:31,236
- Joe.
- Are you okay?

762
00:40:31,316 --> 00:40:34,036
I'm okay, I'm okay.
I'm a little bruised, but...

763
00:40:34,106 --> 00:40:35,576
Everybody else?

764
00:40:35,656 --> 00:40:36,796
Yeah, we're okay.

765
00:40:36,876 --> 00:40:40,916
Guys...
Dr. Ambres didn't make it.

766
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:47,806
There's no sign of them
anywhere.

767
00:40:47,886 --> 00:40:49,756
I don't understand
what happened.

768
00:40:49,836 --> 00:40:52,306
I mean, we got Dwyer,
we gave him the cure.

769
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:55,306
If... if Cicada doesn't exist
anymore, who was that?

770
00:40:56,546 --> 00:40:58,476
Someone worse.

771
00:41:31,256 --> 00:41:33,556
I've missed you.

772
00:41:40,556 --> 00:41:42,476
Uncle Orlin.

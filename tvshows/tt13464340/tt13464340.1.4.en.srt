is "What about life

But, you know,
in spite of the silliness of ufology,

59
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:02,000
I do believe
that there is other life in the universe.

60
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,480
And, as a scientist, um,
I... I... I'm taken to that belief,

61
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,080
because I really believe that's where
the numbers now are leading us.

62
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,000
A couple of years ago, a colleague and I 

63
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,520
tried to take all the amazing data
that we now have,

64
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,280
and we wrote down an equation

65
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,080
that allowed us to calculate

66
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,640
the total number of planets out there
that might have civilizations on them.

67
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,160
Essentially, what we found
was that there were ten billion...

68
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,080
trillion...

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,120
planets out there...

70
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,040
in the right place where life,
and possibly, civilizations could form.

71
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,600
Every one of those planets
is essentially an experiment.

72
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,480
And for none of them, other than ours,
to turn out with a civilization...

73
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,120
that's pushing it quite a bit.

<i>If alien civilizations</i>
<i>are statistically so likely,</i>

Think about it this way.

78
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,880
Out there in the Pacific Ocean, there's
187 million billion gallons of water.

79
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,080
Now, if I take this bucket here
and throw it over...

81

Nothing.

Should I take the fact that I don't see
any life in my bucket 

85
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,520
to tell me that there's no life
in the Pacific Ocean?

86
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,880
Well, that would be crazy, right?
There's all kinds of life out there.

87
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,360
There are sea otters, and whales,
and octopuses, and jellyfishes,

[woman] Octopuses belong
to a group called cephalopods.

129
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,960
And they have evolved down
a completely different pathway.

130
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,520
The octopus has separate nervous systems
in each of its arms.

131
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,640
So, each arm contains
about 14 million neurons.

132

And each arm
can make independent decisions.

All right.

Take this taxi, for example.

147

Wheels were invented more
than five-and-a-half thousand years ago.

Vulcanized rubber has been used for tires
since about 180 years.

150
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,360
So, all of these inventions were necessary

151
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,200
to actually build
something as complicated as this car.

152
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,760
An octopus, by comparison, has to pretty
much figure out everything for himself.

There is no improving and building

[traditional Far Eastern music playing]

[man] Part of what I do
is to try and predict the future.

180
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,960
And you can look back in history
and get a lot of ideas from there,

181
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,280
but there are underlying trends we can use
to some extent to see what's to come,

182
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,600
like life expectancy, wealth,
population size.

183
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,840
And one of the most revealing is the
amount of energy that civilizations use.

184
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,880
<i>The more energy a civilization can access,</i>

185
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,600
<i>the more powerful it becomes.</i>

186

<i>That's the secret of progress...</i>

So, unleashing the heat and energy
in charcoal 

189
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,080
allowed us to get temperatures
hot enough to smelt metals

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,040
to make tools and weapons.

191
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,680
Later on, of course, we harnessed
fossil fuels like coal and gas,

192
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,600
allowing the creation of vehicles
that could hurtle us across the world

and they track the sun
as it moves through the sky

200
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,000
and focus all its energy
down on that tower.

201
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,920
And that energy goes out into the world

<i>But humans use only a tiny fraction</i>
<i>of all the energy available from the sun.</i>

So, 430 quintillion joules of the sun's
energy fall on the Earth every hour.

212
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:10,040
For comparison, that's very roughly
2,000 Hiroshima bombs every second.

A lot of energy. How much do <i>we</i> use?

214
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:19,040
Well, humanity uses
410 quintillion joules... in a year.

215
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,000
So, in a year, we fail to use

all the energy that the sun sends us
in a single hour.

[Philip] If we ever really want to do

In any situation,
it can get itself out of trouble.

295
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,240
The simplest thing that we could mine
on a planet is the regolith,

296
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,680
the dirt that covers
the planetary surface.

297
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,960
You can extract metal from the regolith.

298
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,480
You can also make ceramics that are used
for insulating electrical systems.

299
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,480
And you can make rocket fuel.

300
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,280
But mining does take intelligence.

301
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,800
You have to know where to drive,
where to cut.

302
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,360
You've gotta keep from getting lost,
get yourself unstuck.

303
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,360
So it's going to take a clever machine
like RASSOR

304
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,960

358
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,240
and that basically,
air was leaving the space station,

359
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,920

if we stayed there
and we didn't stop the leak.

-[radio chatter]

375
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,520
[Michael] We're exposed
to radiation on Earth,

376
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,400
but once you go into orbit,

377
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,480
now you're exposed
to thousands of times more radiation.

378
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,880
And that radiation now is damaging
our DNA much faster,

379
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,320
and the repair mechanisms
that we evolved to have

380
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,280
are not able to cope with it.

381
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,920
When I came back from my space flights,

382
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:22,720
they found I had, like, four percent
of my white blood cells had DNA mutations.

383
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:32,320
Most of those mutated cells get killed
by other white blood cells in your body,

384
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,440
but, some of them,
unfortunately, don't die.

385
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,320
They reproduce and mutate
and become cancers.

386
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,600
That is a fundamental risk for astronauts.

387
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,880
And if we imagine going out to stars,

388
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,000

The biggest reason we haven't sent

would really happen.

458
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:31,960

is the concern that some people have

that transmitting intentional messages,
uh, will lead to an alien invasion.

response to that is,

our planet has been giving off evidence
of life for two billion years.

So, if there are any really paranoid
aliens out there 

463
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,560
who want to annihilate any competition,

464
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,200
they've had a long time to come here,
and I haven't seen 'em.

465
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,280
<i>Rather than sending an occasional message</i>
<i>into space,</i>

466
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,400
<i>Doug's plan is to transmit</i>
<i>thousands of them...</i>

467
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,600
<i>when the Arecibo telescope</i>
<i>is on downtime.</i>

468
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,600
[Doug] With radio astronomy,
you can do it any time of the day.

469
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,600
But... I like to do it at night.

470
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,920
Caffeine is essential for astronomers.
Um...

471
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,120
A lot of late nights in the observations
and we have to stay sharp.

472
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,360
[radio signals beeping]

473
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,440
Once a month, Arecibo does a survey
of recently discovered asteroids.

474
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,800
Quite often there's a gap, maybe an hour,

475
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,640
where the transmitter is transmitting
off into space at no particular place.

476
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,560
-[cicadas chirping]
-[bleeping continues]

477
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,560
What I'm proposing is that Arecibo
should use those gaps in the schedule

478
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,320
to target nearby stars with a message,

479
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,880
in case there are any extraterrestrials
in orbit around that star.

480
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:17,240
Each month, we could be targeting
about 50 stars 

481
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,080
that may support intelligent life. 

482
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,040
And for me, it's a no-brainer.
I think we should be doing it.

483
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,320
I think of this in terms
of what's sometimes called

484
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,040
"joining the galactic club."

485
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:36,760
And what I find so strange about that
analogy is that no one ever talks about,

486
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,280
um, paying our dues
or even submitting an application.

487
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,680
And that's what messaging
extraterrestrial intelligence does.

488
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,520
It may just be our way
of making first contact.

489
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,800
Thanks.

490
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,040
[woman] Thank you very much to Doug
for this interesting presentation.

[cicadas chirping]

492
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:04,080
[Doug] When we reach out to other stars,
when we send them our messages,

493
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:10,600
in the best-case scenario,
we get a reply back in 10 or 20 years.

494
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,560
But realistically, it could take
thousands of years.

495
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,360
So this is something that we're doing,

496
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:28,480
not for ourselves, but for our children,
for our grandchildren.

497
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,080
And even for the aliens.

skilled killer to fetch you.

Good. Keep an eye on the new girl.

Safiyah? How do you know her?

170
00:08:50,151 --> 00:08:51,518
How do you know her?

171
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,453
She's been surveilling
Julia and me for months.

172
00:08:54,455 --> 00:08:57,923
Hmm. She always did like to watch.

173
00:08:57,925 --> 00:08:59,425
And why are you here?

174
00:08:59,427 --> 00:09:01,460
To do us both a favor.

175
00:09:01,462 --> 00:09:04,196
You know, it's been a while
since I killed a queen.

00:09:04,198 --> 00:09:06,515
For the record, when you fail

and I end up dead alongside you,

178
00:09:08,136 --> 00:09:11,170
it's no longer considered a favor.

179
00:09:11,172 --> 00:09:15,474
I poisoned my one true friend Mouse

180
00:09:15,476 --> 00:09:20,112
so I could enact the perfect
revenge on my family,

181
00:09:20,114 --> 00:09:23,916
and Safiyah ruined everything!

If I die today,

00:09:26,422 --> 00:09:27,989
so be it.

you people, I'm not part of it.

Don't bother. It's Victor Zsasz.

00:17:11,129 --> 00:17:13,997
Let's figure out who they are first.

328
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,568
Janet Evans is...

329
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,472
a ninth grade biology teacher.

330
00:17:19,474 --> 00:17:22,676
Paul Akins... plumber.

331
00:17:22,678 --> 00:17:25,318
Jamal Walker... stock broker.

332
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,688
I... I don't get this. I'm
not seeing a connection.

333
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,559
There's no way we can
protect all these people.

334
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,267
What if we don't have to?

335
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:39,071
Zsasz doesn't find work, work finds him,

336
00:17:39,073 --> 00:17:43,074
meaning someone hired
him to get this list.

337
00:17:43,076 --> 00:17:45,372
We figure out who he works for,

338
00:17:45,374 --> 00:17:47,141
and we stop them.

339
00:17:47,143 --> 00:17:49,031
- But how?
- I ask him.

340
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:51,000
Because he really opened
up to you the last time.

341
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:53,536
Not as Batwoman. As Ryan.

342
00:17:53,538 --> 00:17:54,888
Are you insane?

343
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,440
Why would a hitman rat out his employer?

344
00:18:00,478 --> 00:18:02,729
But he does know who you are

345
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:05,982
or at least of you peripherally,

346
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,917
so it's worth a shot.

347
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,585
Or you become a tally mark

348
00:18:09,587 --> 00:18:10,654
over his right eyebrow.

349
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:13,923
Or I find out who hired him.

350
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:16,058
You're a billionaire, right?

351
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,095
How much of that is liquid?

352
00:18:33,544 --> 00:18:35,978
Plenty of open seats elsewhere.

353
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,115
You don't remember me.

354
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:41,784
I dated Angelique Martin.

355
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:43,787
You're Angelique's ex?

356
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,490
Heh heh heh.

357
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:47,494
Then by all means,

358
00:18:47,496 --> 00:18:49,597
stay and do whatever you want.

359
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,962
Just don't do to me what you did to her.

360
00:18:52,964 --> 00:18:54,530
So you do know me.

361
00:18:54,532 --> 00:18:56,532
I know you broke her heart.

362
00:18:56,534 --> 00:18:57,834
Apologies if I'm overstepping.

363
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:00,503
I'm just a sucker for lesbian drama.

364
00:19:00,505 --> 00:19:03,005
Heh heh. She was bad for me.

365
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:04,975
That's how you know it's love.

366
00:19:07,645 --> 00:19:09,612
Word on the street

367
00:19:09,614 --> 00:19:12,681
your last job went sideways.

368
00:19:12,683 --> 00:19:14,885
That mean you're available for hire?

369
00:19:28,032 --> 00:19:29,765
You want me to kill your ex?

370
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:31,902
I want you to take out Alice.

371
00:19:33,104 --> 00:19:35,372
Her Wonderland gang killed my mom.

372
00:19:36,774 --> 00:19:39,875
Sideways doesn't mean my job's over.

373
00:19:39,877 --> 00:19:41,744
So whose price do I need to beat?

374
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:43,113
Heh.

375
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:47,084
I don't kill and tell.

376
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:02,731
Luke, did I get the sniffer
close enough to his phone?

377
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:05,167
LUKE: Yep. Vacuumed up all his data

378
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:06,937
along with 3 layers of encryption.

379
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:10,008
Stand by while I burrow through
his most recent contacts,

380
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,710
and...

381
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:14,648
the mystery client is...

382
00:20:16,293 --> 00:20:18,694
Safiyah.

383
00:20:18,696 --> 00:20:21,465
I know you want me to be a bad person,

384
00:20:21,467 --> 00:20:23,401
but I'm not.

385
00:20:23,403 --> 00:20:25,704
I didn't kill your sister.

386
00:20:25,706 --> 00:20:29,087
Last thing I'd ever do is draw
attention to my island.

387
00:20:29,089 --> 00:20:31,223
Then why do I have a note signed by you

388
00:20:31,225 --> 00:20:33,629
saying otherwise?

389
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:36,599
Oh, then by all means, you got me Alice.

390
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:38,372
My name was on a note.

391
00:20:38,374 --> 00:20:39,575
Then who blew it up?

392
00:20:39,577 --> 00:20:42,579
Clearly someone who thought
you still matter to me.

393
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:49,279
Last year, I worked with
one of your men, the Rifle.

394
00:20:50,948 --> 00:20:53,223
Traded a weapon designed
to kill Batwoman

395
00:20:53,225 --> 00:20:57,887
in exchange for a vial of
your Desert Rose serum.

396
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:00,089
Only I reneged on my end,

397
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:03,360
handed over a broken
piece of technology.

398
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:08,899
Go on. I'm dying to know how this ends.

399
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:12,301
You killed my entire
gang in retaliation.

400
00:21:12,303 --> 00:21:14,004
You have a gang?

401
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:17,773
- Had.
- Killing lackeys.

402
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:19,209
Sounds tedious.

403
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,676
Or thorough.

404
00:21:20,678 --> 00:21:22,711
If I was being thorough,

405
00:21:22,713 --> 00:21:25,182
why are you standing here?

406
00:21:33,624 --> 00:21:35,925
[SIGHS]

407
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,395
So why is Alice still alive?

408
00:21:41,365 --> 00:21:43,432
Safiyah prides herself

409
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:47,102
on being a fair and just ruler.

410
00:21:47,104 --> 00:21:50,839
Safiyah took her in,
groomed her to be a soldier,

411
00:21:50,841 --> 00:21:52,843
and promised her an eternity

412
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:54,986
of protection and health.

413
00:21:54,988 --> 00:21:56,788
But Alice had her heart
set on destroying

414
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,425
the Kane family back in Gotham.

415
00:21:59,427 --> 00:22:01,584
So let me guess.

416
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:03,086
Alice betrayed her?

417
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:09,599
Alice broke the cardinal
rule of the island.

418
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:13,512
She tried to leave

419
00:22:13,514 --> 00:22:16,833
and take a Desert Rose flower with her.

420
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:23,139
SAFIYAH: I've forgiven you for
what you did all those years ago...

421
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,954
Which is why it's going
to be much harder

422
00:22:26,956 --> 00:22:28,723
forgiving you for this.

423
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,583
You exposed the secret of
the Desert Rose to the world.

424
00:22:36,587 --> 00:22:40,422
Coryana is the garden,
and I am its keeper.

425
00:22:40,424 --> 00:22:44,193
My family has dedicated lifetimes
to protecting its secret.

426
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:46,589
History is littered with colonizers

427
00:22:46,591 --> 00:22:48,364
who come with their false ideals

428
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,466
and pillage for their own profit...

429
00:22:50,468 --> 00:22:54,670
the African diamond trade,
oil in the Middle East.

430
00:22:54,672 --> 00:22:57,471
Coryana is no different.

431
00:22:57,473 --> 00:22:59,207
Our garden will be ravaged,

432
00:22:59,209 --> 00:23:03,279
and our peaceful island
will cease to exist.

433
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,281
Well, maybe you should
have thought about that

434
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,816
before you blew up my sister's jet.

435
00:23:07,818 --> 00:23:10,187
I didn't bring down her jet.

436
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:11,641
And I didn't expose the secret

437
00:23:11,643 --> 00:23:14,645
of the Desert Rose to the world.

438
00:23:14,647 --> 00:23:17,749
I gave it to just one person,

439
00:23:17,751 --> 00:23:20,687
and she did the rest.

440
00:23:20,689 --> 00:23:24,433
And who is this person?

441
00:23:24,435 --> 00:23:26,535
Safiyah. I've never heard of her.

442
00:23:26,537 --> 00:23:28,605
It's one of her many aliases.

443
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,207
The only Safiyah we have in our database

444
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:31,940
has half a dozen European passports

445
00:23:31,942 --> 00:23:33,108
with just as many names...

446
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,845
Nasar, Sohail, Patel...

447
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:36,779
Okay. So how do we find her?

448
00:23:36,781 --> 00:23:38,447
Well, if she's extremely shady,

449
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:42,184
odds are Ryan's already
in a book club with her.

450
00:23:42,186 --> 00:23:44,054
What's your problem with her?

451
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:46,157
I don't have a problem with Ryan.

452
00:23:48,843 --> 00:23:51,111
Then what's your problem with me?

453
00:23:56,029 --> 00:23:57,863
This is not a permanent gig.

454
00:23:57,865 --> 00:23:59,466
I know. You've said
that a thousand times.

455
00:23:59,468 --> 00:24:01,879
Then why get her a job, lie to her P.O.,

456
00:24:01,881 --> 00:24:03,714
throw a pep rally every time
she does something right?

457
00:24:03,716 --> 00:24:05,682
Because we're her team. She's the Bat.

458
00:24:05,684 --> 00:24:07,951
She's a stand-in who fits in the suit

459
00:24:07,953 --> 00:24:10,288
- until Kate comes back.
- Except she's not!

460
00:24:17,494 --> 00:24:22,165
Kate is not coming back, Luke.

461
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,134
How can you say that

462
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,504
after everything we've been through?

463
00:24:33,425 --> 00:24:37,695
Because there are scientific theories

464
00:24:37,697 --> 00:24:39,865
on multiple worlds,

465
00:24:39,867 --> 00:24:43,870
and there are odds for
surviving a car crash.

466
00:24:43,872 --> 00:24:48,075
Do you know what the
odds are for surviving

467
00:24:48,077 --> 00:24:50,745
a plane explosion mid-air,

468
00:24:50,747 --> 00:24:54,383
and even if you do
survive the explosion,

469
00:24:54,385 --> 00:24:58,589
how do you survive the fall?

470
00:24:58,591 --> 00:25:01,726
You looked me in the eye

471
00:25:01,728 --> 00:25:04,797
and said, "miracles happen".

472
00:25:06,053 --> 00:25:08,188
I know...

473
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:13,504
But so do tragedies.

474
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:17,259
And the city needs a hero.

475
00:25:17,261 --> 00:25:19,089
It needs a Batwoman,

476
00:25:19,091 --> 00:25:20,857
someone who's not perfect

477
00:25:20,859 --> 00:25:24,664
but who can show us all
that there is still hope

478
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:26,967
despite everything,

479
00:25:26,969 --> 00:25:29,304
and that's Ryan.

480
00:26:08,303 --> 00:26:10,637
- Good. You're still here.
- Oh.

481
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:13,073
- You need to see this.
- What's up?

482
00:26:13,075 --> 00:26:15,241
Roxanne's CT scans came back.

483
00:26:15,243 --> 00:26:18,378
Oh, no. Did her cancer progress?

484
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,748
That was the scan from last month.

485
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,452
This... was from yesterday.

486
00:26:28,123 --> 00:26:31,091
Where'd her cancer go?

487
00:26:31,093 --> 00:26:34,825
MARY, ON PHONE: Stage 3 cancer
doesn't just disappear overnight.

488
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:37,366
- What's the patient's name?
- Roxanne Adams.

489
00:26:37,368 --> 00:26:38,535

the symptoms of the Bat bite.

but you know
as well as I do

5
00:00:18,044 --> 00:00:21,896
that stories, like
the people who tell them,

00:00:21,973 --> 00:00:24,482
aren't always what they seem.

you said because

Ruelle:
♪ This tear will never mend ♪

650
00:38:18,697 --> 00:38:24,093
♪ How did it come to this? ♪

651
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:29,723
Figured you'd left town.

652
00:38:34,504 --> 00:38:36,513
I want you to tell
me that I was right.

653
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:39,775
You were never going
to make me a Crow.

654
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,604
You're right.

655
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,699
I never wanted you
to be a Crow.

656
00:38:51,947 --> 00:38:54,740
The Military was
my dream for you.

657
00:38:54,816 --> 00:38:57,376
I'd call in a favor,
get you a desk job,

658
00:38:57,453 --> 00:38:59,411
a staff,
and the occasional papercut

659
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:02,214
would be the only bloodshed
you'd ever see.

660
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:03,716
That wasn't my dream.

661
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:08,962
No. No. You wanted to be
in the action.

662
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:12,049
That's why I didn't want
you to be a Crow...

663
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:14,226
because I'm selfish

664
00:39:14,303 --> 00:39:17,396
and overly protective,

665
00:39:17,473 --> 00:39:20,065
and I'm terrified

666
00:39:20,142 --> 00:39:24,403
and because you're all
I have left, Kate,

667
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,823
and I don't want to
lose you, too.

668
00:39:30,819 --> 00:39:32,694
Look. This is all
my way of saying

669
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:37,416
that if... if you want
to be part of the team,

670
00:39:37,493 --> 00:39:39,543
you're in.

671
00:39:41,571 --> 00:39:43,422
[Sighs]

672
00:39:47,744 --> 00:39:50,712
Kate, voice-over: My dad was
running from his pain,

673
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:52,506
but I was running, too,

674
00:39:52,582 --> 00:39:55,050
toward everything
that didn't want me,

675
00:39:55,127 --> 00:39:56,843
a military academy,

676
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,345
a private army,

677
00:39:58,356 --> 00:40:00,430
my own father.

678
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:04,860
I spent 15 years
searching for a place I fit,

679
00:40:04,937 --> 00:40:07,446
and I think I've
finally found it.

680
00:40:07,523 --> 00:40:10,440
Some see fear,
others hope.

681
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:13,068
I see the freedom
to be myself,

682
00:40:13,145 --> 00:40:15,788
to play by own rules.

683
00:40:15,864 --> 00:40:19,574
I believe you're going to
come home one day, Bruce,

684
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:21,368
and before you kill me
for borrowing

685
00:40:21,445 --> 00:40:22,577
a few of your things,

686
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:24,788
I want you to read
my story

687
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:27,416
because it's only just begun.

688
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:30,511
Miss you,
your cousin Kate.

689
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:36,141
Luke: You know,
for a minute there,

690
00:40:36,218 --> 00:40:38,727
really felt like
he was home.

691
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:45,267
Hey. Look.
For what it's worth,

692
00:40:45,343 --> 00:40:47,644
Bruce never
stopped looking

693
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:49,822
for your sister's
body.

694
00:40:49,898 --> 00:40:52,950
It is worth more
than you think.

695
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:58,488
Guy had the best tech
on the planet.

696
00:40:58,499 --> 00:41:01,166
Why didn't he find her?

697
00:41:25,008 --> 00:41:28,110
Beth: Make sure
our necklaces are in it.

698
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:36,034
Beth.

699
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:43,533
Alice, thinking: I'll win you
over, my dear sister.

700
00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:50,007
The two of us
will rule Gotham together.

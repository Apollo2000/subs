00:00:06,107 --> 00:00:10,275
 Not having a care in the world
        getting you down?

4
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:12,544
       -It's Nora's and my
    three-month anniversary.

              -Aww.
              -Aww.

11
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:27,559
        Fold it in half,
     and it looks like $40.

  Tonight there is a supermoon.

20
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:53,118

           and look up

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,423
        and let the magic
  of the supermoon do the rest.

22
00:00:57,425 --> 00:01:00,159
    -Actually, the supermoon
     is just a regular moon

23
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:02,261
 that's in its closest position
      to the Earth's orbit,

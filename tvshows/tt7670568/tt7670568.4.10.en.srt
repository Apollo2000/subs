And now bring out the Crocodile!

158
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:12,759
Crocodile has been
a total fan favorite.

159
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:16,730
He's shown all season long he
may be the greatest showman.

160
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:19,466
‐ Oh! ‐ Oh, yeah!

161
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:22,435
Croc‐ing it up!

162
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,771
Croc‐ing the party.

163
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,639
‐ Game on! ‐ Game on.

164
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,876
So,
we're kicking things off with the Seahorse.

165
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:33,446
She is so talented she
could go all the way.

166
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,049
Here's the journey
of the Seahorse.

167
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,426
<i>Before "The Masked Singer,"</i>

168
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:44,457
<i>I'd only ever let small
glimpses of my inner diva out.</i>

169
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,627
Even as a young girl,
I knew I wanted to sing,

170
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,929
but I was just so darn shy.

171
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,798
<i>But when I finally
got the courage,</i>

172
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,733
<i>it was like a faucet turning on.</i>

173
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,101
♪ Make me feel

174
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,404
<i>Now, behind the Seahorse mask,</i>

175
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,974
<i>I feel like that little girl discovering
her purpose all over again.</i>

176
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,544
‐ That was spot on.
That was crazy. ‐ Right?

177
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:09,682
<i>And it's time for her to muster up that
same courage because it's the semi‐finals.</i>

178
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:12,385
And I'm pretty sure I
know who the Crocodile is.

179
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:15,255
And if I'm right,
I'm very intimidated

180
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:18,525
<i>because that showman can
sing and dance in his sleep.</i>

181
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,794
If I'm going to beat
him at his own game,

182
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,632
I've gotta add choreography, and I've never
even attempted it before this competition.

183
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,510
Good for her for stepping
out of her comfort zone.

184
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,269
<i>If I want to make
it to the finale,</i>

185
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:32,906
I've gotta stop saying no to
myself and start saying, "Yes, I can."

186
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:38,278
<i>Because brave little girls
grow up to be fierce women.</i>

187
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:41,648
Okay, now look up for a clue.

188
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:44,284
‐ Oh,
telescope. ‐ She loves "Star Wars."

189
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,319
Do you see things
more clearly now?

190
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:51,591
We know Seahorse is a favorite. Like,
her voice is insane.

191
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:54,394
But Croc has been,
like, a fan favorite.

192
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,596
This is when it comes
down to song choice.

193
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,465
‐ And who wants it
bad enough. ‐ That's it.

194
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,468
Like,
who's willing to leave it all on the stage.

195
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,803
Seahorse, Popcorn.

196
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:08,975
This feels like what a
conversation on acid is like.

197
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:12,812
<i>After the break,
the Seahorse and Crocodile go head to head.</i>

198
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,914
Oh,
Crocodile does not want to come home.

199
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:18,952
<i>It's anyone's game at this
fight night full of surprises.</i>

200
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,454
The Sun is trembling right now.

201
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:25,625
<i>Plus three incredible celebrity
unmaskings at the end of the night.</i>

202
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:27,594
‐ Oh, my goodness! ‐ Yeah!

203
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,497
I got you right! I got it right!

204
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,837

The Seahorse,
ladies and gentlemen!

244
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:42,595
That was hot. I mean,

- ‐ let alone the
semi‐finals! - Whoo!

246

There isn't anything you
can't do with your voice, honey,

The diversity week after week,
and them rhymes and them ad‐libs.

250
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,080
This stage has never seen
runs and ad‐libs like that.

251
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:05,618
Yes. This show is crazy.

252

You lit my soul up.

253
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,590
It felt like you were
dancing in the clouds,

254
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:13,092
just playing and jumping
from cloud to cloud.

255
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,062
That's really
beautiful. Thank you.

256
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,298
Wow. Beautiful indeed.

257
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,100
Now,
when our singers joined the competition,

258
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,436
they put all their
clues into a safe.

259
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:27,640
Tonight,
we'll be taking a look inside of them

260
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:30,810
to see who on the panel our
singers are connected with.

261
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:33,112
So, Men in Black,

262
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,414
bring out the safe.

263
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:41,421
‐ Bring 'em out. ‐ Ooh, fancy.

264
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,825
The Seahorse has
a treasure chest safe.

265
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:47,827
Let's crack this thing open.

266
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:51,831
‐ It's a party safe. ‐ Oh!

267
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:54,300
Oh!

268
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,378
- ‐ Wait, wait, wait,
wait. - Hey, hey, hey, hey.

269
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,338
‐ What? ‐ Father, stop.

270
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,516
- ‐ You need lunch money,
don't you? - Oh, yeah, yeah.

271
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,576
- ‐ Hey, you do what you
gotta do. - All right.

272
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:06,012
All right,
let's see who you have a connection with.

273
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,120
Oh. ‐ Oh, wait, me?

274
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,456
Now that's interesting.
This has never happened.

275
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,424
‐ I guess I get one
this season. ‐ Ah.

276
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:21,160
So, Nick, this is wild,

277
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:25,231
but even before this show,
you were a great host to me.

278
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:27,166
Oh.

279
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:30,169
‐ She was on "Wild 'n Out." ‐ I mean,
I host other stuff, too.

280
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,513
I'm about to say or
"America's Got Talent."

281
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,306
‐ But she said
"wild." ‐ Ken: Yeah.

282
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,476
‐ Robin, what you got? ‐ Well,
you know, it's been bothering me

283
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,278
since the last time she sang,
so I've been thinking about it.

284
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:43,649
The voice, the riffs, um,
remind me of Tori Kelly.

285
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,452
Her and I performed
together. I recognize that voice.

286
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:50,523
Also there were a lot of
competition show clues,

287
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,625
and she was on "American Idol."

288
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:55,161
‐ I never hosted that
show. ‐ Fantastic.

289
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,463
Then it's not Tori Kelly.

290
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,632
I'm still stuck
on the telescope.

291
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,601
‐ I figured it
out. ‐ What is it?

292
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:05,371
Well, this artist has a song
called "Meet Me In Space."

293
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:08,641
Also "spaceship." And
I mentioned her before,

294
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,444
I'm thinking this
could be Kesha.

295
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:16,482
All right, all right. Craig,
who do you think the Seahorse might be?

296
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:20,119
I just wrote "telescope."

297
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:24,390
Thinking of that, she said,
"Do you see a connection?"

298
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:28,494
‐ She's a "see"
horse. Okay? ‐ Oh.

299
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:31,264
And in telescopes,
she's got some songs,

300
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,100
‐ "Space Between"
and "Moon." ‐ Ah.

301
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:37,236
That's good.

302
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,139
‐ Pretty good. ‐ I like that
your wheels are turning, Craig,

303
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:42,475
Well, whoever she is,

304
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:46,112
she's one of my favorite singers
we've ever had on this series.

305
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:50,116
‐ Amazing. ‐ All right, incredible job,
incredible performance.

306
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:53,186
Seahorse, keep it going for her.

307
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,455
<i>Did the Seahorse's
vocals pack enough punch</i>

308

Seahorse got us off to the races,

And the way you sang it,
corny alert,

396
00:20:47,234 --> 00:20:49,245
but it was like, okay,
this is that end of the movie.

‐ Yes, Men in Black. ‐ Yeah!

404
00:21:08,889 --> 00:21:10,991
He got one of those,

412
00:21:38,085 --> 00:21:40,520
‐ No. ‐ I mean,
he's not gonna get an answer.

413
00:21:40,587 --> 00:21:42,098
- ‐ He can ask all the questions he
wants. - Oh, but you can tell

414
00:21:42,122 --> 00:21:43,857
by body language,
right? Right? Right?

415
00:21:43,924 --> 00:21:46,360
You know how to
read Crocodile body?

416
00:21:46,426 --> 00:21:48,495
I‐‐ no,
I narrowed it down to 20 people.

417
00:21:48,562 --> 00:21:50,330
Oh!

418
00:21:50,397 --> 00:21:52,866
I've only been on screen
with a few professional singers,

419
00:21:52,933 --> 00:21:55,345
and everybody's talking about
how it feels like it's a boy band.

420
00:21:55,369 --> 00:21:58,872
‐ Yes. ‐ And only boy band I
sang with was Backstreet Boys

421
00:21:58,939 --> 00:22:01,208
in the movie "This Is the End."

422
00:22:01,274 --> 00:22:04,745
But then the only
two people who have croc‐lings

423
00:22:04,811 --> 00:22:07,147
or kids out of the
Backstreet Boys

424
00:22:07,214 --> 00:22:11,151
is AJ McLean or Howie D.

425
00:22:11,218 --> 00:22:14,321
Yeah, but you know what?
Nick Carter also has kids.

426
00:22:14,388 --> 00:22:19,026
I said Backstreet Boys,
not Backstreet Men.

427
00:22:19,092 --> 00:22:24,031
Well, from the rocker voice,
I know that AJ lends his voice to that.

428
00:22:24,097 --> 00:22:25,408
Yeah,
he definitely has a rocker voice.

429
00:22:25,432 --> 00:22:27,200
‐ AJ McLean. ‐ All right.

430
00:22:27,267 --> 00:22:29,136
All right, all right,
all right. Settle.

431
00:22:29,202 --> 00:22:33,340
I think croc‐lings
for his three kids.

432
00:22:33,407 --> 00:22:38,178
Jeans block. I tell you no one,
and I repeat, no one

433
00:22:38,245 --> 00:22:41,882
rocked a pair of
shirtless denim overalls

434
00:22:41,948 --> 00:22:45,285
better than Nick Lachey
during his 98 Degrees days.

435
00:22:45,352 --> 00:22:47,220
Pizza rat, New York City.

436
00:22:47,287 --> 00:22:51,458
Nick Lachey has a daughter named Brooklyn
and she likes pizza and hates rats.

437
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:55,295
Look at him. He's stopping. Nick Lachey,
yes, you are.

438
00:22:55,362 --> 00:22:58,799
‐ Nick Lachey, guess where‐‐ hey, come on.
No, no, no. ‐ Crocodile's done with you.

439
00:22:58,865 --> 00:23:01,701
Come back! No, no, no. No,
no. I know you're Nick Lachey

440
00:23:01,768 --> 00:23:04,971
because Nick and Craig have a connection,
all right?

441
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:08,675
Nick Lachey guest‐starred
on "The Office".

442
00:23:08,742 --> 00:23:11,144
I remember the scene. He was like,
"Yo, I'm Nick Lachey.

443
00:23:11,211 --> 00:23:13,947
- ‐ Where Darryl at?" Great
episode. - These are lies.

444
00:23:14,014 --> 00:23:15,458
Nick Lachey's never
been on "The Office."

445
00:23:15,482 --> 00:23:19,953
‐ Whoa. ‐ I do think that
is a good guess though.

446
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,130
‐ I think so. ‐ 'Cause
I thought it could be

447
00:23:21,154 --> 00:23:22,856
Nick Lachey at
one point as well.

448
00:23:22,923 --> 00:23:26,093
- ‐ You almost made Crocodile walk
off the stage. - You know what?

449
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,704
It's not the first time a contestant
has left during one of my guesses

450
00:23:28,728 --> 00:23:31,698
and it won't be the
last. That's all I'm saying.

451
00:23:31,765 --> 00:23:33,667
You know what? Wait, wait, wait.

452
00:23:33,733 --> 00:23:36,803
Nick, I just want to say,
with anything in life,

453
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:39,840
it always comes down to
how bad do you want it?

454
00:23:39,906 --> 00:23:43,376
‐ Right. Me, too. ‐ And tonight,
I felt like this is the super six.

455
00:23:43,443 --> 00:23:46,213
'Cause I was like, oh,
Crocodile does not want to go home.

456
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:49,015
‐ No. He gave me all the
feelings. ‐ Indeed, indeed.

457
00:23:49,082 --> 00:23:51,451
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for the Crocodile

458
00:23:51,518 --> 00:23:54,387
one more time for that
amazing performance.

459
00:23:54,454 --> 00:23:57,390
<i>Did the Croc rock enough
to beat the Seahorse?</i>

460
00:23:57,457 --> 00:24:00,393
<i>Tell us what you think.</i>

461
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:06,133
Oh, my God. Here we are. Having to pick
one because they're both equally insane.

462
00:24:06,199 --> 00:24:07,734
This is hard.

463
00:24:07,801 --> 00:24:12,606
Okay, studio audience, panel,
and superfans at home,

464
00:24:12,672 --> 00:24:14,641
it is time to vote.

465
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:18,578
Do you want Seahorse...

466
00:24:18,645 --> 00:24:22,582
or Crocodile in the finale?

467
00:24:22,649 --> 00:24:25,318
One of them stays,
and one of them goes.

468
00:24:25,385 --> 00:24:27,087
This is one of those
free pass moments

469
00:24:27,154 --> 00:24:28,922
where they both
should be moving on.

470
00:24:28,989 --> 00:24:31,124
‐ I can't imagine voting
against her. ‐ I know.

471
00:24:31,191 --> 00:24:34,027
Vote now for your favorite.

472
00:24:37,998 --> 00:24:39,933
Oh, this is awful.

473
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,602
Okay, I have the results,

474
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:46,306
and it is extremely close.

475
00:24:46,373 --> 00:24:50,710
And the singer
advancing to the finale is...

476
00:24:53,213 --> 00:24:56,283
‐ Ah, I'm sweating. ‐ I got
the heebie‐jeebies right now.

477
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,088
The Crocodile!

478
00:25:02,155 --> 00:25:03,790

479
00:25:03,857 --> 00:25:05,659
Congratulations, Crocodile!

480
00:25:05,725 --> 00:25:08,795
The Golden Mask trophy
is still within your reach.

481
00:25:08,862 --> 00:25:11,264
‐ Wow! ‐ Yeah!

482
00:25:11,331 --> 00:25:15,235
Keep it going for the
one and only Seahorse.

483
00:25:15,302 --> 00:25:19,239
‐ Wow. ‐ Seahorse,
unfortunately the road does stop here,

484
00:25:19,306 --> 00:25:24,077
but we are super excited because we
get to actually see who the Seahorse is.

485
00:25:24,144 --> 00:25:26,947
‐ Yes! ‐ But we'll have
to wait until later tonight,

486
00:25:27,013 --> 00:25:30,483
so flap those fins
backstage and get ready.

487
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,686
‐ Ugh. ‐ That one hurt.

488
00:25:32,752 --> 00:25:35,255
‐ Wow. ‐ There's some
other amazing singers coming.

489
00:25:35,322 --> 00:25:38,792
‐ I mean, it's a high bar,
so... ‐ Totally.

490
00:25:38,858 --> 00:25:42,295
But there is some other singers
coming and you're going to be like...

491
00:25:42,362 --> 00:25:43,964
Stop playing!

492

<i>There's still two
intense face‐offs to come.</i>

493

‐ Oh! ‐ That was insane!

494
00:25:48,702 --> 00:25:50,804
She just took us all to church.

495
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,606
<i>And later,
Seahorse is unmasked...</i>

so let's see who on our panel

610
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:15,345
the Mushroom is connected to.

611
00:32:15,412 --> 00:32:17,514
Men in Black,
bring out the safe.

612
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,648
Yeah!

613
00:32:22,318 --> 00:32:24,354
‐ Oh, my God. ‐ Yeah, yeah.

614
00:32:24,421 --> 00:32:26,523
Mushroom's got, like,
a New York apartment as a safe.

615
00:32:26,589 --> 00:32:28,792
Wow. It's a walk‐in safe.

616
00:32:28,858 --> 00:32:30,727
‐ Yeah. ‐ You can
hide Ken in there.

617
00:32:30,794 --> 00:32:32,529
Okay.

618
00:32:32,595 --> 00:32:34,431
All right, one big safe.

619
00:32:34,497 --> 00:32:36,232
Ah,
look at that! Another little safe.

620
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:38,068
‐ Wow. A safe. ‐ Oh!

621
00:32:38,134 --> 00:32:39,469
You're real secretive,
aren't you?

622
00:32:39,536 --> 00:32:42,105
He does not want you
to get in his little safe.

623
00:32:42,172 --> 00:32:44,107
I'm used to breaking
into these things.

624
00:32:44,174 --> 00:32:46,342
I wasn't always a TV host.

625
00:32:49,345 --> 00:32:51,281
‐ Robin. ‐ Ah.

626
00:32:51,347 --> 00:32:53,316
‐ Oh? ‐ Ah.

627
00:32:53,383 --> 00:32:56,453
I do have a connection
with Mushroom.

628
00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:00,623
‐ Nice. ‐ Robin,
I love mixing it up with you again.

629
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:05,095
Because this is definitely not
the first time we've connected.

630
00:33:05,161 --> 00:33:08,064
I love it.

631
00:33:08,131 --> 00:33:09,566
Mixing it up with me again?

632
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,401
Does anything come
to mind? Does it help?

633
00:33:11,468 --> 00:33:14,046
Well, you know, there's just something
about everything that you stand for.

634
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:18,241
Your talent, your voice. I still
get a feeling that it's Jaden Smith.

635
00:33:18,308 --> 00:33:20,243
Ooh, I like it.

636
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:24,180
If Jaden Smith has these level vocals,
man, that's a talented family.

637
00:33:24,247 --> 00:33:25,758
Well, he does a little bit of everything,
you know?

638
00:33:25,782 --> 00:33:28,418
‐ He does. ‐ Yeah. Well,
I'm gonna try someone new today.

639
00:33:28,485 --> 00:33:33,590
‐ Ah. ‐ So I noticed every
time Mushroom takes the stage,

640
00:33:33,656 --> 00:33:38,261
when Mushroom walks,
he leads with his hips.

641
00:33:38,328 --> 00:33:42,699
‐ That what you noticed? ‐ Yes.
I've never seen anyone walk like that.

642
00:33:42,765 --> 00:33:46,536
I walked from the parking lot
with my hips to the stage today.

643
00:33:46,603 --> 00:33:50,473
‐ Ken,
you kinda like do this. ‐ Whoa! Whoa!

644
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:54,210
Well, are they a dancer? Maybe
I'm not thinking of the right person.

645
00:33:54,277 --> 00:33:57,981
‐ Could this be a dancer? ‐ Uh‐oh,
hey, hey, hey.

646
00:33:58,047 --> 00:34:01,985
So then I was thinking of this young
talent by the name of Jordan Fisher.

647
00:34:02,051 --> 00:34:05,054
Oh. Had
a lot of "Hamilton" clues,

648
00:34:05,121 --> 00:34:07,924
and Jordan Fisher was in
"Hamilton" on Broadway.

649
00:34:07,991 --> 00:34:10,059
Okay, so you know what?

650
00:34:10,126 --> 00:34:14,197
Just like Nicole,
I'm getting a Broadway vibe.

651
00:34:14,264 --> 00:34:17,033
And then that range
to go anywhere

652
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,935
brought me into mind
of Leslie Odom Jr.

653
00:34:19,002 --> 00:34:21,004
Oh. ‐ Leslie Odom.

654
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,372
Yeah, yeah, that's solid.

655
00:34:22,438 --> 00:34:25,508
A lot of people, Craig,
are talking about musicians.

656
00:34:25,575 --> 00:34:28,912
I am thinking of
multi‐hyphenates.

657
00:34:28,978 --> 00:34:31,181
Allow me to
explain. Alarm clock.

658
00:34:31,247 --> 00:34:35,385
Person I'm thinking is
notoriously woke. "Brrring!"

659
00:34:35,451 --> 00:34:38,388
‐ Bring? ‐ Bring? Is that
the new sound for woke?

660
00:34:38,454 --> 00:34:40,089
‐ Can I finish? ‐ Brrring!

661
00:34:40,156 --> 00:34:44,060
Okay‐‐ who's, say,
flipped on his head.

662
00:34:44,127 --> 00:34:48,198
This person I'm thinking
about has flipped from comedian

663
00:34:48,264 --> 00:34:51,601
to sketch comedy actor to game show host,
so...

664
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:56,105
‐ Brrring! ‐ Previous clues of
orange make me think orange peel

665
00:34:56,172 --> 00:34:58,641
for his frequent
collaborator Jordan Peele.

666
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:01,945
So I am thinking
Keegan‐Michael Key.

667
00:35:02,011 --> 00:35:06,049
‐ Ooh. Brrring! ‐ Brrring!

668
00:35:06,115 --> 00:35:08,985
Mushroom,
I don't know who you are yet,

669
00:35:09,052 --> 00:35:11,020
which is killing me,
but I just love you

670
00:35:11,087 --> 00:35:12,889
and you're here
for a great purpose.

671
00:35:12,956 --> 00:35:15,225
‐ Yes! ‐ Ladies and gentlemen,

672
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:19,062
one more time for the Mushroom.

673
00:35:19,128 --> 00:35:20,930
<i>Was the Mushroom's
performance enough</i>

674
00:35:20,997 --> 00:35:23,233
<i>to squash his opponent,
the Jellyfish?</i>

675
00:35:23,299 --> 00:35:25,902
<i>Tell us what you think.</i>

676
00:35:25,969 --> 00:35:27,904
<i>I came to
spread the love tonight,</i>

677
00:35:27,971 --> 00:35:30,173
<i>and I think I accomplished that.</i>

678
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,442
I know Jelly is a
serious competitor,

679
00:35:32,508 --> 00:35:35,178
but if I've made some
people smile today,

680
00:35:35,245 --> 00:35:37,046
then I've already won.

681
00:35:37,113 --> 00:35:40,183
Mushroom has been pretty
confident from the start.

682
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,228
I mean,
we've heard so many different vocal styles.

683
00:35:42,252 --> 00:35:44,420
Right,
but now it's up against Jellyfish,

684
00:35:44,487 --> 00:35:46,298
‐ who's been getting better and
better every week. ‐ That's right.

685
00:35:46,322 --> 00:35:48,524
Consistency versus
kind of evolution.

686
00:35:48,591 --> 00:35:50,593
‐ Growth. ‐ It's
so unpredictable.

687
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,263
Yeah. ‐ It's
seriously balls to the wall.

688
00:35:53,329 --> 00:35:54,964
Like, it's anybody's game.

689
00:35:55,031 --> 00:35:58,101

692

Before the break, Mushroom
sprouted a brilliant vocal display.

693

But now we hear from his
face‐off competitor the Jellyfish.

‐ What? ‐ Ken, you have a fan.

762
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:40,138
At last! But she
said we haven't met,

763
00:40:40,205 --> 00:40:42,307
but I can't say I haven't tried.

764
00:40:42,374 --> 00:40:44,709
‐ That mean she text
you? ‐ Slid into his DMs.

765
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,511
Got Jellyfish in your DMs?

766
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:49,748
There is nothing depressing about a
51‐year‐old man looking at his DMs.

767
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:53,752
Nothing. Okay,
just through process of elimination,

768
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:56,154
‐ this may be an Olympic
gold medalist. ‐ Yeah.

769
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:57,622
But when I noticed
all the white,

770
00:40:57,689 --> 00:41:00,091
maybe it's not a gymnast.
Maybe it's a skier.

771
00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:02,227
Maybe it's someone
in the Winter Olympics.

772
00:41:02,294 --> 00:41:05,564
If we're thinking, like,
snow and maybe the "X" could be X Games.

773
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:10,101
‐ Whoa. ‐ My wife and two
daughters are huge fans of Chloe Kim.

774
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:13,572
Oh. ‐ Such a
pioneer for Asian Americans.

775
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,540
‐ Wow. ‐ I like that. I
like where you're going.

776
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:17,943
‐ A very heartfelt guess
right there. ‐ Yeah.

777
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:22,948
‐ Nicole, what you thinking? ‐ Originally,
I was getting the Charli XCX vibe,

778
00:41:23,014 --> 00:41:25,951
but this week with
the Eiffel Tower clue,

779
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:29,187
this artist is French,
French Canadian, I believe.

780
00:41:29,254 --> 00:41:31,590
‐ Grimes. ‐ Ah.

781
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,258
It said "pushed through."

782
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:36,561
Well, Grimes pushed through

783
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:38,196
a little baby in May
with Elon Musk.

784
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:42,601
Oh. ‐ There were a
lot of "Xs" in the clue packages

785
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:46,938
for their baby's name,
which I'll pay anyone who knows their name.

786
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:50,241
You know, I believe that the Eiffel Tower,
the Paris connection,

787
00:41:50,308 --> 00:41:53,645
is because of the Olympics
are gonna be in Paris in 2024.

788
00:41:53,712 --> 00:41:56,615
‐ Oh, yeah. ‐ So,
I think it would be somebody

789
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,717
who is going to compete.

790
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:01,920
Gabby Douglas is around 25,
26 years old,

791
00:42:01,987 --> 00:42:03,064
has been through
some ups and downs

792
00:42:03,088 --> 00:42:04,599
'cause there was an
Ups and Downs Drive

793
00:42:04,623 --> 00:42:06,658
for the roller coaster
gymnast career.

794
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:08,093
I'm gonna go with Gabby Douglas.

795
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:12,397
‐ Okay. ‐ Whoever you are,
it's very inspiring.

796
00:42:12,464 --> 00:42:14,742
And something just tells me
you have the heart of a champion.

797
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:16,034
I mean, well done. Amazing.

798
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:17,902
The Jellyfish,
ladies and gentlemen.

799
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:20,071
‐ Keep it going for her. ‐ Ah.

800
00:42:20,138 --> 00:42:24,776
<i>Did the Jellyfish sink the
Mushroom and swim her way into the finale?</i>

801
00:42:24,843 --> 00:42:27,512
<i>Tell us what you think.</i>

802
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:30,181
Studio audience, panel,

803
00:42:30,248 --> 00:42:32,017
and superfans at home,

804
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:33,918
it is time to vote.

805
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:36,454
Do you want Mushroom,

806
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:38,590
or do you want Jellyfish

807
00:42:38,657 --> 00:42:41,026
to join the Crocodile
in the finale?

808
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:43,595
Vote now for your favorite.

809
00:42:43,662 --> 00:42:45,964
It is impossible to vote
somebody off of this.

810
00:42:46,031 --> 00:42:47,032
I know.

811
00:42:49,968 --> 00:42:52,237
The people have spoken,

812
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:57,008
and the singer
heading to the finale is...

813
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,311
‐ Uh‐oh. ‐ I hate this part.

814
00:43:00,378 --> 00:43:01,379
Yeah.

815
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:07,018
Mushroom!

816
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,187
Yes, Mushroom!

817
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:10,722
Mushroom, big congrats.

818
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:13,224
We'll see you in the
finale along with Crocodile

819
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:17,228
and the winner of our next face‐off,
Popcorn versus Sun.

820
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:18,663
Look at that walk.

821
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:21,766
Gonna be rehearsing
for that Golden Mask trophy.

822
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:24,569
‐ Jellyfish,
come on down here. ‐ Jelly!

823
00:43:24,636 --> 00:43:28,073
Keep it going for the Jellyfish,
ladies and gentlemen.

824
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:30,208
Unfortunately,
we have to say good‐bye to you,

825
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:32,577
but we can't wait to see who you are,
right?

826
00:43:32,644 --> 00:43:35,180
‐ Yes! ‐ Nick: We'll have to
wait until the end of the night,

827
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:38,450
‐ so swim backstage
and get ready.

828
00:43:38,516 --> 00:43:42,253
‐ Jellyfish! ‐ Nick: <i>Coming up,
it's our final showdown.</i>

829
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,090
‐ Oh! ‐ That was a
religious experience.

830
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:47,759
‐ Yes. ‐ <i>One of these
divas will be unmasked</i>

831
00:43:47,826 --> 00:43:50,361
<i>with Seahorse and Jellyfish
at the end of the show.</i>

832
00:43:50,428 --> 00:43:52,197
‐ Oh! ‐ Ken: Whoa!

833
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:53,498
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

834
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:02,107
Welcome back to "The
Masked Singer" super six!

835
00:44:02,173 --> 00:44:04,909
We're only one face‐off away

836
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:07,145
from finding out who's
going with Crocodile

837
00:44:07,212 --> 00:44:09,247
and Mushroom in the finale...

838
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:13,218
‐ Whoo! ‐ <i>...and who will be
unmasked with Seahorse and Jellyfish.</i>

839
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:16,387
We've reached our
final face‐off of the night.

840
00:44:16,454 --> 00:44:19,390
It's Popcorn versus Sun.

841
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:22,360
Emerge from the mouths, ladies.

842
00:44:22,427 --> 00:44:24,996
Popcorn has wowed
us all season long

843
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:29,400
with her playful presence and
legendary vocal power and projection.

844
00:44:29,467 --> 00:44:32,403
Make some noise for Popcorn.

845
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:34,739
Hi, Popcorn.

846
00:44:34,806 --> 00:44:37,008
Lovely Popcorn.

847
00:44:37,075 --> 00:44:42,113
Meanwhile, Sun has stunned
us with her multi‐octave range

848
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,949
and a voice that
cannot be matched.

849
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:48,052
Ladies and gentlemen, the Sun.

850
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:49,954
Oh, this is gonna be so good!

851
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:54,425
Wow. How do we choose
between two diva heavyweights?

852
00:44:54,492 --> 00:44:57,095
Only one of them can
make it into the finale.

853
00:44:57,162 --> 00:44:59,731
And first up is the Popcorn.

854
00:44:59,798 --> 00:45:03,468
Pop it.

855
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:06,471
I feel so blessed to
be here as the Popcorn.

856
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:08,373
Not just because I
get more quality time

857
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:11,376
<i>with my main squeeze Nick,</i>

858
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:15,346
<i>but because being here,
I can take people to a happy place</i>

859
00:45:15,413 --> 00:45:17,015
<i>and spread a
message of positivity.</i>

860
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:20,485
Beautiful.

861
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:23,388
<i>But it's also been
emotional for me.</i>

862
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:27,358
<i>Like, I've literally been crying under
my mask at the panel's comments.</i>

863
00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:29,360
All of the emotion,
the strength,

864
00:45:29,427 --> 00:45:32,263
and the vulnerability all came
through in that performance.

865
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:34,332
Outstanding. Gorgeous.

866
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:37,535
Going up against Sun tonight,
I know she has a killer voice.

867
00:45:37,602 --> 00:45:39,237
<i>But I'm gonna do
what I've been doing</i>

868
00:45:39,304 --> 00:45:41,539
<i>since all these other
creatures were in diapers.</i>

869
00:45:41,606 --> 00:45:44,242
‐ Since they were in diapers? ‐ Oh,
this popcorn is seasoned.

870
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:46,244
<i>I'm gonna go out
there and rock it,</i>

871
00:45:46,311 --> 00:45:48,079
<i>live the message of the song,</i>

872
00:45:48,146 --> 00:45:50,081
<i>just like I've done for decades.</i>

873
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:53,518
I've rehearsed and prepared
every waking moment

874
00:45:53,585 --> 00:45:56,254
because I'm determined to
cross winning "The Masked Singer"

875
00:45:56,321 --> 00:45:59,090
<i>off my Popcorn bucket list.</i>

performance. She came to win.

Blazing the stage indeed. What is
the Popcorn hiding in her safe, though?

934
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:47,959
Men in Black,
please bring out the safe.

935
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:52,630
Oh.

there's a lot of candy and popcorn.

00:49:06,744 --> 00:49:08,679
Ah.

938
00:49:08,746 --> 00:49:13,351
Jenny,
we've definitely talked before,

939
00:49:13,418 --> 00:49:16,320
but never about how we both

940
00:49:16,387 --> 00:49:19,657
are published authors.

941
00:49:19,724 --> 00:49:21,459
That's two clues. ‐ Ah.

942
00:49:21,526 --> 00:49:23,694
Well,
both of the people that I think

943
00:49:23,761 --> 00:49:26,364
are published authors
and have been on my show.

944
00:49:26,431 --> 00:49:27,865
Based off the
sound of your voice,

945
00:49:27,932 --> 00:49:29,700
I'm thinking Mary Wilson.

946
00:49:29,767 --> 00:49:32,003
I know Mary Wilson
is a published author.

947
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:33,838
And then also,
I thought Taylor Dayne

948
00:49:33,905 --> 00:49:35,740
because there was,
like, crimped hair,

949
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:37,708
'80s, like, Rubik's Cube.

950
00:49:37,775 --> 00:49:40,378
Taylor has a song called "Unstoppable,"
I believe.

951
00:49:40,445 --> 00:49:42,013
And there was
that stop sign clue,

952
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,715
so this clue fits
for both guesses.

953
00:49:44,782 --> 00:49:46,884
Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah. ‐ All right.

954
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:49,487
Could be. But
I'm thinking from the voice,

955
00:49:49,554 --> 00:49:51,989
I want to say Tina Turner.

956
00:49:52,056 --> 00:49:53,891
But, you know,
just to throw in some fun

957
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:55,269
'cause when I look
at this costume,

958
00:49:55,293 --> 00:49:57,728
I don't know why,
it's just screaming Bette Midler,

959
00:49:57,795 --> 00:49:59,864
another amazing movie star diva.

960
00:49:59,931 --> 00:50:02,400
Goes with the popcorn
'cause she's a movie star.

961
00:50:02,467 --> 00:50:04,945
And she's been doing her thing
since the other singers were in diapers

962
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:08,372
‐ just like she said. ‐ Bette's
got that grit in her voice, too,

963
00:50:08,439 --> 00:50:10,041
and a powerful vocalist.

964
00:50:10,108 --> 00:50:12,577
I think when you look
at the clue package,

965
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:15,580
it lends itself towards Bette
Midler with the personality.

966
00:50:15,646 --> 00:50:18,516
Great guess. Now Craig looks
like he's taking this very seriously.

967
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:21,919
Me? Oh, my God,

Craig, who is this?

972
00:50:30,661 --> 00:50:35,533

the clue with the stop sign,

973
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,870

00:56:38,262 --> 00:56:41,232
What do you want
to say to the Sun?

1074
00:56:41,298 --> 00:56:43,701
- ‐ I just love you.
- I know.

1075
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:45,145
The reason why I
love music so much,

1076
00:56:45,169 --> 00:56:48,239
it transcends anything,
and you have such a gift.

1077
00:56:48,305 --> 00:56:51,041
Like, just listening to you,

1078
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:55,379
all I could do is just
exhale and just breathe.

1079
00:56:55,446 --> 00:56:58,849
Just listening to you,
I could listen to you forever.

1080
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:02,887
You have a voice of the heavens.

1081
00:57:02,953 --> 00:57:06,957
That was flawless. You
are flawless. Thank you.

1082
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:09,260
Amazing.

1083
00:57:11,629 --> 00:57:12,563
Craig, I saw you.

1084
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:14,031
You had your head in your hands

1085
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:18,068
you were so emotionally moved.

1086
00:57:18,135 --> 00:57:20,804
All my life,

1087
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:24,575
I've felt...

1088
00:57:24,642 --> 00:57:27,077
the heat of the sun.

1089
00:57:28,979 --> 00:57:32,917
I had never heard the
voice of the sun until now.

1090
00:57:32,983 --> 00:57:34,084
Wow.

1091
00:57:35,886 --> 00:57:38,822
It's times like these

1092
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:41,926
we all need a little
more sunlight in our lives.

1093
00:57:41,992 --> 00:57:45,829
So,
what's inside the safe of the Sun?

1094
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:47,197
Let's all find out together.

1095
00:57:47,264 --> 00:57:50,668
Men in Black,
bring out the Sun's safe.

1096
00:57:52,002 --> 00:57:53,070
Bring it out.

1097
00:57:57,942 --> 00:57:59,977
It's unlocked.

1098
00:58:01,245 --> 00:58:04,381
Uh‐oh. Got you some bling here.

1099
00:58:04,448 --> 00:58:06,984
‐ She's got a gold medal.
‐ A gold sun for Nicole.

1100
00:58:07,051 --> 00:58:09,053
‐ Ooh, I'm honored. ‐ Nicole.

1101
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:11,722
Well,
it's great to see you on this big stage

1102
00:58:11,789 --> 00:58:15,726
'cause last time we
met was in the bathroom.

1103
00:58:18,095 --> 00:58:20,564
‐ I love it so much!
‐ Talk about angelic.

1104
00:58:20,631 --> 00:58:23,734
I thought it was gonna
be something glorious.

1105
00:58:23,801 --> 00:58:28,005
I've had the most glorious meetings
in the bathrooms at award shows.

1106
00:58:28,072 --> 00:58:30,040
Nicole, is it ringing a bell?

1107
00:58:30,107 --> 00:58:33,143
Ironically, I've met a lot of
people in the bathroom, so...

1108
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:36,580
Okay, all right.

1109
00:58:36,647 --> 00:58:39,717
Well,
it was always in all of the clue packages,

1110
00:58:39,783 --> 00:58:41,018
there were, like, blue wings

1111
00:58:41,085 --> 00:58:43,187
or blue butterflies
or something.

1112
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:47,591
We obviously know her
for her first major hit "Blue."

1113
00:58:47,658 --> 00:58:50,227
I think it could be LeAnn Rimes.

1114
00:58:50,294 --> 00:58:52,863
‐ Ah. ‐ That's pretty good.

1115
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:54,531
‐ But... ‐ Uh‐oh.

1116
00:58:54,598 --> 00:58:57,568
...there was the fire clue,
right?

1117
00:58:57,635 --> 00:58:59,536
And I'm obsessed
with this album,

1118
00:58:59,603 --> 00:59:01,038
"The Firewatcher's Daughter."

1119
00:59:01,105 --> 00:59:04,842
So it could be Brandi
Carlile or LeAnn Rimes.

1120
00:59:04,908 --> 00:59:06,877
‐ All right. ‐ Yes.

1121
00:59:06,944 --> 00:59:10,547
So the question is did you meet
either one of them in the bathroom?

1122
00:59:10,614 --> 00:59:13,651
I actually think I've met
both of them in the bathroom.

1123
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:14,985
That's where girls, like, bond.

1124
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:17,154
Chilling in the bathroom?

1125
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:20,491
Okay. Ken, who is the Sun?

1126
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:23,961
Okay, ah, man,
this is ju‐‐ I'm just gonna say it.

1127
00:59:24,028 --> 00:59:26,730
How about Kate
"Hud‐sun" for Sun?

1128
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:28,198
‐ Ah. ‐ Oh, wow.

1129
00:59:28,265 --> 00:59:30,501
The sunny daughter
of Goldie Hawn.

1130
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,503
‐ There was gold
in the clue. ‐ Yeah.

1131
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:36,073
Also was in the movie "Fool's Gold,"
Kate "Hud‐sun."

1132
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:38,175
Literal. Sun. Love it. Drop it.

1133
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:40,511
‐ Okay. ‐ Wow. He just
dropped the mic right there.

1134
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:43,814
Yeah,
I'm scratching what you sniffing.

1135
00:59:43,881 --> 00:59:45,182
Who is this, Craig?

1136
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:49,053
So, I have zero shot at this.

1137
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,721
I can't even steal somebody's.

1138
00:59:50,788 --> 00:59:52,690
I gotta go off the clues,

1139
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:55,526
and I'm stuck on
the fire‐breathing.

1140
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:58,662
Dragon. Mother of
Dragons. Khaleesi.

1141
00:59:58,729 --> 01:00:01,865
And the Sun is head to toe gold,

1142
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:04,168
and she's been nominated for,
like, four Emmys.

1143
01:00:04,234 --> 01:00:06,904
- ‐ It's Emilia Clarke.
- Yes.

1144
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:10,040
‐ Oh,
that's good. ‐ That's a great guess.

1145
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:12,543
‐ Thank you, thank you. ‐ Well,
one thing we do know,

1146
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:13,889
this was an amazing performance.

1147
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:15,612
One of the best we've ever had.

1148
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:17,681
Ladies and gentlemen,
keep it going for the Sun.

1149
01:00:17,748 --> 01:00:20,551
Lord have mercy.

1150
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:23,620
This is a tough competition.

1151
01:00:23,687 --> 01:00:26,957
‐ Right? ‐ Popcorn lifted
me way up in the air.

1152
01:00:27,024 --> 01:00:30,928
And the Sun said, "Hey, like,
take the training wheels off.

1153
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:33,197
‐ You can fly. Go
ahead." ‐ Yeah.

1154
01:00:33,263 --> 01:00:35,199
<i>These are our
panel's Sun guesses.</i>

1155
01:00:35,265 --> 01:00:37,968
<i>Is she the one who will
advance to the finale?</i>

1156
01:00:38,035 --> 01:00:39,636
<i>Tell us what you think.</i>

1157
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:44,241
It is time for the panel,
studio audience,

1158
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:45,876
and our superfans at home

1159
01:00:45,943 --> 01:00:48,979
to vote for which queen
they want to see battle

1160
01:00:49,046 --> 01:00:51,749
Crocodile and
Mushroom in the finale.

1161
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:56,253
Popcorn versus Sun.

1162
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,956
‐ This is so hard. ‐ Oh.

1163
01:00:59,022 --> 01:01:01,825
One of them stays,
and one of them goes.

1164
01:01:01,892 --> 01:01:04,995
‐ Oh,
man. ‐ Vote now for your favorite.

1165
01:01:09,233 --> 01:01:11,568
Okay, I have the results.

1166
01:01:11,635 --> 01:01:17,040
And the diva with the
least amount of votes is...

1167
01:01:17,107 --> 01:01:18,107
Golly.

1168
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,714
‐ You know what
I'm gonna say. ‐ Oh!

1169
01:01:23,781 --> 01:01:25,883
‐ Oh,
man. ‐ I gotta build the suspense!

1170
01:01:25,949 --> 01:01:27,985
We'll unmask one of
them after the break.

1171
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,455
<i>♪ Who is that?</i>

1172
01:01:34,825 --> 01:01:37,961
The singer taking the last spot

1173
01:01:38,485 --> 01:01:40,988
in the finale is...

1174
01:01:41,054 --> 01:01:42,556
‐ Oh. ‐ Oh, man.

1175
01:01:42,623 --> 01:01:44,400
There's no winner
here. There's no winner.

1176
01:01:44,424 --> 01:01:46,326
This is the hardest moment

1177
01:01:46,393 --> 01:01:48,629
out of all seasons
of "Masked Singer."

1178
01:01:51,498 --> 01:01:54,001
The Sun!

1179
01:01:54,067 --> 01:01:57,237
‐ Oh,
my gosh! ‐ Congratulations, Sun.

1180
01:01:57,304 --> 01:02:00,540
You made your way into
the finale. You go rest up.

1181
01:02:00,607 --> 01:02:05,078
But we definitely have to make some
noise for the one and only Popcorn.

1182
01:02:05,145 --> 01:02:07,180
This amazing queen right here.

1183
01:02:07,247 --> 01:02:09,983
- ‐ Oh,
we love you. - We hate to see you go,

1184
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:13,053
but I cannot wait
to see who you are.

1185
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,855
I'm really baffled by this one.

1186
01:02:14,921 --> 01:02:17,858
But before we find out who you are,
Popcorn...

1187
01:02:17,924 --> 01:02:20,127
‐ Oh,
no. ‐ ...let's retrieved the panel's

1188
01:02:20,193 --> 01:02:23,797
first impression
guesses from the vault!

1189
01:02:25,232 --> 01:02:28,502
Men in Black, bring 'em out.

1190
01:02:28,568 --> 01:02:29,970
Now, it's been months.

1191
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:33,373
‐ Ugh. ‐ These should be fun.

1192
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,476
And remember, panel,
if your first impression guess is correct,

1193
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:39,179
you get a point towards
the Golden Ear trophy.

1194
01:02:39,246 --> 01:02:41,181
‐ ‐ Oh, gosh.

1195
01:02:41,248 --> 01:02:45,986
You know what? Everyone
has the exact same guess...

1196
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:47,421
‐ What? ‐ No way!

1197
01:02:47,487 --> 01:02:50,390
...except for Nicole.

1198
01:02:50,457 --> 01:02:54,494
Nicole, Diana Ross.

1199
01:02:54,561 --> 01:02:59,166
I said Diana Ross because
that first time we heard her sing,

1200
01:02:59,232 --> 01:03:02,336
I got legendary vibes,
right? And then I saw a crown.

1201
01:03:02,402 --> 01:03:03,603
And I was like the Queen.

1202
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:06,807
And I was like Diana Ross,
skee‐ska, ahh!

1203
01:03:06,873 --> 01:03:09,943
Then we got a lot of New York
vibes with "Sex and the City,"

1204
01:03:10,010 --> 01:03:11,712
the matzo balls. Like,
oh, she's Jewish.

1205
01:03:11,778 --> 01:03:13,814
But what really gave
it away is that tone,

1206
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,817
so I'm gonna double
down with Jenny.

1207
01:03:16,883 --> 01:03:19,720
I'm pretty sure
it's Taylor Dayne.

1208
01:03:19,786 --> 01:03:22,155
- ‐ Taylor Dayne,
all right. - Great guess.

1209
01:03:22,222 --> 01:03:27,060
Now, everyone else on
the panel wrote Tina Turner.

1210
01:03:27,127 --> 01:03:29,329
- ‐ Tina Turner. Whoo!
- Tina Turner.

1211
01:03:29,396 --> 01:03:32,466
‐ Robin, you sticking with that? ‐ Well,
I started with Tina,

1212
01:03:32,532 --> 01:03:35,369
but then thinking
about other classic divas

1213
01:03:35,435 --> 01:03:38,004
and the outfit kind of
reminded me of a Bette Midler.

1214
01:03:38,071 --> 01:03:42,476
But, no. The voice, the legs,
very familiar with all of that.

1215
01:03:42,542 --> 01:03:47,047
So I am going to stick with
the amazing Tina Turner.

1216
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:50,083
‐ I'm gonna stay with Tina. Come on,
Tina! ‐ All right. Doubling down.

1217
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:52,352
Come on,
Tina! Butter my popcorn!

1218
01:03:52,419 --> 01:03:55,322
‐ Jenny, you sticking with Tina
Turner? ‐ You know, first of all,

1219
01:03:55,389 --> 01:04:00,060
I want to tell you, Popcorn, how
blessed we were to have you on this show,

1220
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:05,298
'cause your voice is absolutely
breathtaking, powerful.

1221
01:04:05,365 --> 01:04:08,101
And I know that
you are a legend,

1222
01:04:08,168 --> 01:04:10,270
and that's why I'm so
excited to say who you are,

1223
01:04:10,337 --> 01:04:12,272
and I just feel, like,
a little bit geeked out

1224
01:04:12,339 --> 01:04:14,141
because I grew
up listening to you.

1225
01:04:14,207 --> 01:04:16,710
I made out with my
boyfriends to your songs.

1226
01:04:16,777 --> 01:04:22,115
That voice and those clues
like crimped hair, Rubik's Cube‐‐

1227
01:04:22,182 --> 01:04:25,185
‐ Taylor Dayne. ‐ All right.

1228
01:04:25,252 --> 01:04:27,387
Tina Turner to Taylor Dayne.

1229
01:04:27,454 --> 01:04:29,389
Ken Jeong,
are you sticking with Tina Turner?

1230
01:04:29,456 --> 01:04:31,358
Yes, I am,
and I'll tell you why.

1231
01:04:31,425 --> 01:04:34,661
‐ Aww,
great. ‐ I honestly don't know

1232
01:04:34,728 --> 01:04:37,964
who could sing better
than this than Tina Turner.

1233
01:04:38,031 --> 01:04:39,391
This is the queen
of rock and roll.

1234
01:04:39,433 --> 01:04:43,170
Even the book clue,
like, author of a book.

1235
01:04:43,236 --> 01:04:49,009
Also the stop sign clue for
the unstoppable Tina Turner.

1236
01:04:49,075 --> 01:04:51,912
I want that Golden Ear so bad,
Nick, I can taste it.

1237
01:04:51,978 --> 01:04:55,182
‐ Or hear it, whatever. ‐ Nick:
All right. My brother Craig?

1238
01:04:55,248 --> 01:04:58,351
Okay, so, she said decades.

1239
01:04:58,418 --> 01:05:00,320
Now I'm thinking
the Marvelettes,

1240
01:05:00,387 --> 01:05:02,923
the Pointer Sisters,
the Supremes.

1241
01:05:02,989 --> 01:05:05,192
And then who's got a book out?

1242
01:05:05,258 --> 01:05:08,795
Mary Wilson put a
book out just last year.

1243
01:05:08,862 --> 01:05:11,698
And then I saw "stop"
‐‐ in the name of love.

1244
01:05:11,765 --> 01:05:15,936
The Supremes. So I'm
going with Taylor Dayne.

1245
01:05:16,002 --> 01:05:18,338
Oh, my God. ‐ Doing the pivot.

1246
01:05:18,405 --> 01:05:23,043
‐ You do the same thing, Ken. ‐ I
do not. I'm based in logic and thought.

1247
01:05:23,109 --> 01:05:26,646
All right.
We're gonna find out which one of you

1248
01:05:26,713 --> 01:05:28,849
can even possibly be right.

1249
01:05:28,915 --> 01:05:30,650
You've made your final guesses.

1250
01:05:30,717 --> 01:05:34,888
Popcorn, who are you? Audience,

1261
01:06:04,985 --> 01:06:06,820
with over 75
million records sold,

1262
01:06:06,887 --> 01:06:11,191
the one and only Taylor Dayne!

1263
01:06:11,258 --> 01:06:13,293
So fabulous!

1264
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:16,863
You did an amazing job
on the show. So outstanding.

1265
01:06:16,930 --> 01:06:22,035
I had a ball. Nobody understands
how amazing this show is. Amazing.

1266
01:06:22,102 --> 01:06:24,938
So much fun.
Jenny was on to you.

1267
01:06:25,005 --> 01:06:26,806
I was. I grew
up listening to you.

1268
01:06:26,873 --> 01:06:29,209
‐ You know I love you. And
I‐‐ ‐ I love you, you know.

1269
01:06:29,276 --> 01:06:32,979
I was freaking out when I figured
you out. I was like, "Oh, my God!

1270
01:06:33,046 --> 01:06:36,850
Taylor Dayne's on our
stage!" You were amazing.

1271
01:06:36,917 --> 01:06:39,986
You were amazing on this show. So,
what was the best part?

1272
01:06:40,053 --> 01:06:43,623
The creativity here, guys. Your
magic between all of you up here.

1273
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:47,160
‐ Craig, I love you. I just wanted
to say that. ‐ I love you, too.

1274
01:06:47,227 --> 01:06:50,664
You lifted us up tonight. Can I
play piano for you sometime?

1275
01:06:50,730 --> 01:06:54,167
You‐‐ tonight.

1276
01:06:54,234 --> 01:06:58,838
You electrified us. And then your vocals,
the grit,

1277
01:06:58,905 --> 01:07:01,675
the depth, the pain,
the passion.

1278
01:07:01,741 --> 01:07:04,244
I mean, honestly, you gave me
everything in my heart and soul,

1279
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:06,846
so God bless you and thank you,
Taylor.

1280
01:07:06,913 --> 01:07:10,150
‐ Amazing. ‐ You guys made me
cry under this mask so many times.

1281
01:07:10,216 --> 01:07:12,786
‐ Aww. ‐ And, Nick,
I just‐‐ I really do. I love you.

1282
01:07:12,852 --> 01:07:16,456
Can you handle
two Long Island girls?

1283
01:07:16,523 --> 01:07:19,125
‐ I love it! ‐ I like
'em from Long Island.

1284
01:07:19,192 --> 01:07:21,494

1305
01:08:29,496 --> 01:08:31,831
We've just popped
the mask off Popcorn

1306
01:08:31,898 --> 01:08:34,300
to reveal legendary
singer Taylor Dayne.

1307
01:08:34,367 --> 01:08:38,271
And now it's time for the second
unmasking of the night‐‐ Jellyfish.

1308
01:08:38,338 --> 01:08:40,774
We can't wait to see who you are,
right?

1309
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,009
‐ Yes! ‐ But first,

1310
01:08:43,076 --> 01:08:46,513
let's retrieve the panel's first
impression guesses from...

1311
01:08:46,579 --> 01:08:48,982
‐ Oh, no. ‐ ...the vault.

1312
01:08:49,049 --> 01:08:52,352
Men in Black, bring 'em out.

1313
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,855
Do you guys remember
what you said?

1314
01:08:55,922 --> 01:08:58,124
‐ No! ‐ I have no idea.

1315
01:08:58,191 --> 01:09:00,160
Now, Robin,

1316
01:09:00,226 --> 01:09:03,363
your first impression
guess was Addison Rae.

1317
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:05,031
Yes. ‐ That's a good one.

1318
01:09:05,098 --> 01:09:06,966
Well,
there was a lot of Instagram,

1319
01:09:07,033 --> 01:09:08,401
and there was Instaclam,

1320
01:09:08,468 --> 01:09:13,440
but I'm gonna go back
to my fierce five guess.

1321
01:09:13,506 --> 01:09:17,143
I'm gonna go with our Olympic
gold medalist Gabby Douglas.

1322
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:19,846
Gonna stick with
Gabby. All right.

1323
01:09:19,913 --> 01:09:22,315
Now, Jenny,
your first impression guess...

1324
01:09:22,382 --> 01:09:25,318
‐ ‐ Daisy Ridley.

1325
01:09:25,385 --> 01:09:28,288
Oh,
that's right. There was a lightsaber clue.

1326
01:09:28,354 --> 01:09:30,690
So that made me go,
"Oh, it could be her."

1327
01:09:30,757 --> 01:09:33,159
And then I moved
out of the actress world

1328
01:09:33,226 --> 01:09:37,130
and decided to go more athlete because
I feel like there were gymnast clues,

1329
01:09:37,197 --> 01:09:40,366
like baby powder,
her parents driving her everywhere,

1330
01:09:40,433 --> 01:09:41,868
the ups and downs.

1331
01:09:41,935 --> 01:09:44,838
So I think this is
McKayla Maroney.

1332
01:09:44,904 --> 01:09:47,207
All right. That's a good one.

1333
01:09:47,273 --> 01:09:51,778
Nicole, your first impression guess,
Sofia Richie.

1334
01:09:51,845 --> 01:09:53,279
‐ Yes. ‐ That's pretty good.

1335
01:09:53,346 --> 01:09:55,448
‐ You sticking with it? ‐
Nicole: I'm gonna change.

1336
01:09:55,515 --> 01:09:59,319
I am a big fan of her
tone and her voice.

1337
01:09:59,385 --> 01:10:02,288
We got the new clue with Paris,
Eiffel Tower.

1338
01:10:02,355 --> 01:10:06,192
She's French Canadian,
so I'm gonna go with Grimes.

1339
01:10:08,361 --> 01:10:12,866
Ken, you said Yara Shahidi.

1340
01:10:12,932 --> 01:10:15,902
‐ You sticking with it? ‐ I've thought
a variety of people over the weeks.

1341
01:10:15,969 --> 01:10:19,472
But now, just thinking, like,
someone who I admire

1342
01:10:19,539 --> 01:10:21,708
and someone who
is a national hero

1343
01:10:21,775 --> 01:10:24,878
and someone who won her
Olympic gold medal at the age of 17.

1344
01:10:24,944 --> 01:10:27,847
I'm gonna go with my guess.
I'm gonna go with Chloe Kim.

1345
01:10:27,914 --> 01:10:30,074
Craig,
if you're gonna steal something,

1346
01:10:30,116 --> 01:10:33,086
it would be this guess.
This is the most solid.

1347
01:10:33,153 --> 01:10:35,054
She spoke like a champion.

1348
01:10:35,121 --> 01:10:38,525
She said, "I realized not only
could I hang with these people,

1349
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:41,060
I can best them."

1350
01:10:41,127 --> 01:10:45,231
You know, and that was like‐‐ that's
somebody who's always reaching higher.

1351
01:10:45,298 --> 01:10:48,735
‐ I'm going with
Chloe Kim. ‐ Okay.

1352
01:10:48,802 --> 01:10:50,236
Even if I don't get
the guess right,

1353
01:10:50,303 --> 01:10:52,539
the fact that Craig
copied my guess?

1354
01:10:52,605 --> 01:10:54,774
I'm already a winner.

1355
01:10:54,841 --> 01:10:57,210
‐ There was‐‐ ‐ I really
appreciate it. Say no more.

1356
01:10:57,277 --> 01:10:59,288
When you were talking to this person,
the costume went away.

1357
01:10:59,312 --> 01:11:01,748
Thank you. Shh, shh, shh.

1358
01:11:01,815 --> 01:11:03,049
‐ Thank you. ‐ It went away.

1359
01:11:08,454 --> 01:11:10,190
All right, all right, all right!

1360
01:11:10,256 --> 01:11:13,860
Some weird comedic genius
moment going on right here.

1361
01:11:13,927 --> 01:11:15,862
Oh. ‐ Okay, panel,

1362
01:11:15,929 --> 01:11:18,031
you have made
your final guesses.

1363
01:11:18,097 --> 01:11:20,366
Let's see if any
of you are right.

1364
01:11:20,433 --> 01:11:23,369
Jellyfish,
the world wants to know.

1365
01:11:23,436 --> 01:11:25,972

I got you right!

Congratulations, Ken. I feel like
you won "The Masked Singer."

1382

‐ I don't know. ‐ You
make him so excited.

1383
01:12:11,084 --> 01:12:12,285
You were amazing tonight.

1384
01:12:12,352 --> 01:12:14,020
Thank you for
being an inspiration

1385
01:12:14,087 --> 01:12:15,889
to my daughters.

1386
01:12:15,955 --> 01:12:17,399
My daughters are 13,
in middle school.

1387
01:12:17,423 --> 01:12:19,792
You are a huge
name in our household,

1388
01:12:19,859 --> 01:12:22,195
and you inspire us all.

1389
01:12:22,262 --> 01:12:24,073
Thank you and I wish you
continued success. Oh, my God.

1390
01:12:24,097 --> 01:12:26,666
Thanks, Ken.

1391
01:12:26,733 --> 01:12:29,035
What was our missed connection?

1392
01:12:29,102 --> 01:12:33,172
I watched a YouTube video of you answering,
like, medical questions.

1393
01:12:33,239 --> 01:12:36,042
‐ Yeah. ‐ I was laughing the whole time,
it was so funny.

1394
01:12:36,109 --> 01:12:37,844
So I was like, "Oh,
I should DM him,"

1395
01:12:37,911 --> 01:12:38,954
'cause that's, like,
what we're doing nowadays, right?

1396
01:12:38,978 --> 01:12:41,047
‐ She did DM you. ‐ Oh, you‐‐

1397
01:12:41,114 --> 01:12:43,917
I DMed you on
Instagram and literally not‐‐

1398
01:12:43,983 --> 01:12:45,961
‐ you didn't even read it. ‐
Ken: I didn't‐‐ I didn't know!

1399
01:12:45,985 --> 01:12:48,888
‐ You left it unread? ‐ I
didn't even get a "seen."

1400
01:12:48,955 --> 01:12:51,057
‐ Really? ‐ No,
you do not do that!

1401
01:12:51,124 --> 01:12:54,260
‐ I did not‐‐ ‐ That's the ultimate
millennial disrespect, son!

1402
01:12:54,327 --> 01:12:56,896
‐ Ken! ‐ I'm so sorry!
When I get home,

1403
01:12:56,963 --> 01:12:59,933
‐ I will DM you back and say
thank you. ‐ Oh, now you will.

1404
01:12:59,999 --> 01:13:01,710
I promise. I will‐‐ ‐ Well,
okay. I see how it is.

1405
01:13:01,734 --> 01:13:04,904
So you're gonna leave me
undelivered for two years!

1406
01:13:04,971 --> 01:13:07,507
‐ Two years? ‐ Two years!

1407
01:13:07,573 --> 01:13:10,043
Oh, no,
but serious‐‐ it's all good. All jokes.

1408
01:13:10,109 --> 01:13:11,811
I'm such a big fan
of all of you guys,

1409
01:13:11,878 --> 01:13:14,681
‐ so this whole experience was
just so amazing for me. ‐ Likewise.

1410
01:13:14,747 --> 01:13:17,183
I've never performed in
front of anyone before.

1411
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:19,819
‐ What? ‐ Yeah.

1412
01:13:19,886 --> 01:13:23,990
Watching your journey on
this show was inspirational.

1413
01:13:24,057 --> 01:13:26,192
We saw you come out
here a little bit nervous,

1414
01:13:26,259 --> 01:13:30,830
‐ and each week you just
blew our minds. ‐ Thank you.

1415
01:13:30,897 --> 01:13:33,900
Everything about
you says champion.

1416
01:13:33,967 --> 01:13:36,035
You were fantastic.

1417
01:13:36,102 --> 01:13:39,138
You guys gave me so much
confidence after each week,

1418
01:13:39,205 --> 01:13:41,541
and it's just been such
a fun experience to, like,

1419
01:13:41,607 --> 01:13:43,252
be able to put myself out there,
be vulnerable.

1420
01:13:43,276 --> 01:13:47,046
‐ Aww, we love you. ‐ Like,
I really, really appreciate it.

1421
01:13:47,113 --> 01:13:51,250

1439

Welcome back to "The
Masked Singer" super six!

1440
01:14:57,583 --> 01:15:01,821
We're about to unmask our final
celebrity of the night‐‐ Seahorse.

1441
01:15:01,888 --> 01:15:04,424
But before you take it off,

1442
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:06,459
let's retrieve the panel's

1443
01:15:06,526 --> 01:15:08,661
first impression
guesses from the vault.

1444
01:15:08,728 --> 01:15:10,496
Oh, no!

1445
01:15:10,563 --> 01:15:12,598
Men in Black, bring 'em out!

1446
01:15:15,902 --> 01:15:18,671
Let's see if our panel
can snag a point here.

1447
01:15:18,738 --> 01:15:22,341
So far, none of you have landed a
correct first impression guess tonight.

1448
01:15:22,408 --> 01:15:24,877
‐ Oh, no. ‐ None of these are bad,
though.

1449
01:15:24,944 --> 01:15:29,382
‐ Oh, thanks. ‐ Ken,
you believed that the Seahorse was Fergie.

1450
01:15:29,449 --> 01:15:30,850
‐ Ah. ‐ It's not terrible.

1451
01:15:30,917 --> 01:15:32,385
Are you still
sticking with that?

1452
01:15:32,452 --> 01:15:35,888
First of all, I just have to say,
Seahorse, amazing.

1453
01:15:35,955 --> 01:15:38,458
This was really the
toughest elimination round

1454
01:15:38,524 --> 01:15:40,402
we've ever had in the history
of "The Masked Singer."

1455
01:15:40,426 --> 01:15:42,528
You easily could have won this

1456
01:15:42,595 --> 01:15:44,797
and everything you
did was flawless.

1457
01:15:44,864 --> 01:15:46,842
So I applaud you. I just
honestly think you're so effortless

1458
01:15:46,866 --> 01:15:48,734
‐ and outstanding. ‐ Absolutely.

1459
01:15:48,801 --> 01:15:50,570
I really just want to say that.

1460
01:15:50,636 --> 01:15:53,673
To answer your question,
I'm thinking that telescope,

1461
01:15:53,739 --> 01:15:55,174
which is, I think,
the biggest clue,

1462
01:15:55,241 --> 01:15:59,011
and when you see telescope,
what do you see? Stars.

1463
01:15:59,078 --> 01:16:01,714
Someone had a Hollywood
Walk of Fame star.

1464
01:16:01,781 --> 01:16:04,817
Someone at nine years
old won "Star Search."

1465
01:16:04,884 --> 01:16:07,854
I'm thinking of
Christina Aguilera.

1466
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,656
From Fergie to
Christina Aguilera.

1467
01:16:10,723 --> 01:16:13,993
Yeah. She said "inner
diva" in the clues.

1468
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:16,996
There is no bigger
inner diva than "Xtiva."

1469
01:16:17,063 --> 01:16:19,866
‐ Did you just call her Xdiva? ‐ No,
no. Xtina.

1470
01:16:19,932 --> 01:16:21,767
Oh.

1471
01:16:21,834 --> 01:16:24,003
Well, Robin,
your first impression guess,

1472
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:27,006
you believed it was JoJo.

1473
01:16:27,073 --> 01:16:29,709
I haven't gotten JoJo
since the first vocal.

1474
01:16:31,465 --> 01:16:32,667
I've been thinking about it,

1475
01:16:32,733 --> 01:16:37,004
and there was a smile
with a broken tooth.

1476
01:16:37,071 --> 01:16:39,740
And I'm thinking that
that might be a reference

1477
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:41,709
to Tori Kelly's song
"Unbreakable Smile."

1478
01:16:41,776 --> 01:16:43,511
And there's a guitar,
which she's known

1479
01:16:43,578 --> 01:16:46,681
for being a guitar player.

1480
01:16:46,747 --> 01:16:50,017
And if I have to go
with my final guess,

1481
01:16:50,084 --> 01:16:52,220
I think it's Tori Kelly.

1482
01:16:52,286 --> 01:16:54,255
‐ Okay, okay. ‐ Nick: Jenny,

1483
01:16:54,322 --> 01:16:58,559
your first impression
guess? Halsey.

1484
01:16:58,626 --> 01:17:00,494
Um,
you know what? That's not bad

1485
01:17:00,561 --> 01:17:04,365
'cause I was wrestling
between Kesha and her.

1486
01:17:04,432 --> 01:17:07,468
And "Halsee" ‐‐ Halsey,

1487
01:17:07,535 --> 01:17:09,637
she has a song
called "Angel On Fire."

1488
01:17:09,704 --> 01:17:14,508
And fire was a reoccurring
clue over and over again,

1489
01:17:14,575 --> 01:17:18,012
so I think I will stick,
and I'm proud of it‐‐

1490
01:17:18,079 --> 01:17:21,349
Halsey.

1491
01:17:21,415 --> 01:17:22,492
There it is. ‐ Wow.

1492
01:17:22,516 --> 01:17:24,118
‐ There it is. ‐
Sherlock Scherzie.

1493
01:17:24,185 --> 01:17:26,520
Oh,
no. I don't remember what I put.

1494
01:17:26,587 --> 01:17:30,057
You put Maren Morris.

1495
01:17:30,124 --> 01:17:32,193
Massive fan of Maren Morris.

1496
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:34,528
Hella vocals on that girl.

1497
01:17:34,595 --> 01:17:38,900
But circling back,
echoing what Robin was saying,

1498
01:17:38,966 --> 01:17:42,536
I know that voice,
and I'm a massive fan.

1499
01:17:42,603 --> 01:17:44,639
There isn't anything
she can't do.

1500
01:17:44,705 --> 01:17:47,241
And because of her church roots

1501
01:17:47,308 --> 01:17:49,977
and winning Grammys
for her gospel album,

1502
01:17:50,044 --> 01:17:54,048
‐ I believe it's Tori
Kelly. ‐ All right.

1503
01:17:54,115 --> 01:17:55,383
You seem quite confident.

1504
01:17:55,449 --> 01:17:57,051
Brother Craig Robinson,

1505
01:17:57,118 --> 01:17:59,020
what is your final guess?

1506
01:17:59,086 --> 01:18:01,555
First I felt like it was Sia,

1507
01:18:01,622 --> 01:18:05,893
and then I felt like it was Tori Kelly,
and then‐‐

1508
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:07,495
‐ I can't. ‐ So, there you go.

1509
01:18:07,561 --> 01:18:09,373
Are you gonna agree with
the two singers on the panel?

1510
01:18:09,397 --> 01:18:12,433
They sound so sure.

1511
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:16,504
But I think you all
covered it beautifully.

1512
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:19,440
Craig is exactly how
I was in high school.

1513
01:18:19,507 --> 01:18:22,343
Whatever the smart people said,
I'm going with them.

1514
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:24,879
Are you not dying
with anticipation?

1515
01:18:24,946 --> 01:18:27,114
I can't wait to see her
take this Seahorse head off.

1516
01:18:27,181 --> 01:18:28,849
‐ I know. ‐ Okay, panel,

1517
01:18:28,916 --> 01:18:31,185
you've made your final guesses.

1518
01:18:31,252 --> 01:18:33,154
Let's see if any of you,

1519
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:35,189
including Craig Robinson,
are close.

1520
01:18:35,256 --> 01:18:39,026
Seahorse, we need to know,
who are you?

1521
01:18:39,093 --> 01:18:40,895

Oh, my goodness! Tori Kelly!

1530
01:19:07,421 --> 01:19:09,790
Yeah! Singer‐songwriter...

1531
01:19:09,857 --> 01:19:14,161
‐ Yeah! ‐ ...and one of the
greatest voices of this generation!

1532
01:19:14,228 --> 01:19:16,864
‐ Oh, my God! ‐ Wow.

1533
01:19:16,931 --> 01:19:18,371
I love it. Nicole,
a friend of yours.

1534
01:19:18,399 --> 01:19:22,303
‐ Someone you sang with before. ‐ Oh,
my gosh. Sis, baby girl.

1535
01:19:22,370 --> 01:19:23,838
I'm not gonna lie.

1536
01:19:23,904 --> 01:19:25,940
I'm gutted that
you're going home

1537
01:19:26,007 --> 01:19:27,184
because we thought
that she could take

1538
01:19:27,208 --> 01:19:28,776
the entire competition.

1539
01:19:31,445 --> 01:19:34,782
There isn't anything you can't do,
honestly.

1540
01:19:34,849 --> 01:19:36,560
Like, you're the best vocalist
we've ever had on this show.

1541
01:19:36,584 --> 01:19:38,853
‐ Oh, my God. Thank you so
much. ‐ You were outstanding.

1542
01:19:38,919 --> 01:19:41,822
‐ Outstanding.
Outstanding. ‐ Thank you.

1543
01:19:41,889 --> 01:19:45,326
So what would make you want
to do "The Masked Singer"?

1544
01:19:45,393 --> 01:19:48,863
I've always even just thought
of myself as just a singer.

1545
01:19:48,929 --> 01:19:51,298
So I thought it would just
be fun to come out here

1546
01:19:51,365 --> 01:19:53,234
and show a whole
'nother side of myself,

1547
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:57,872
be a little more sassy,
you know, show some choreo.

1548
01:19:57,938 --> 01:20:00,074
And I can't be as sassy anymore.

1549
01:20:00,141 --> 01:20:01,876
I have to, like,
go back to being myself.

1550
01:20:03,044 --> 01:20:04,884
She walked out there
and it was all about this.

1551
01:20:04,945 --> 01:20:07,248
And I was like,
"That's not Tori Kelly's vibe at all."

1552
01:20:07,314 --> 01:20:10,317
Hey! I think she snapped
more in this season

1553
01:20:10,384 --> 01:20:12,062
‐ than she has in her entire
life. ‐ Her entire career.

1554
01:20:12,086 --> 01:20:14,255
I swear to
God. ‐ I think that's true.

1555
01:20:14,321 --> 01:20:16,357
Y'all don't go through
what the clues meant?

1556
01:20:16,424 --> 01:20:18,993
‐ He wants to know what the
telescope was all about. ‐ Yes.

1557
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:21,429
Okay, the telescope was because

1558
01:20:21,495 --> 01:20:23,564
I was on "Star
Search" when I was ten.

1559
01:20:23,631 --> 01:20:25,442
‐ It was the first time I
was ever on TV. ‐ Oh, wow.

1560
01:20:25,466 --> 01:20:27,334
Yeah,
you were close. You were close.

1561
01:20:27,401 --> 01:20:29,570
You were close.
‐ Very close. Look at me.

1562
01:20:29,637 --> 01:20:33,908
I could have won probably.
What was that rainbow frog?

1563
01:20:33,974 --> 01:20:35,443
A nod to when I got to sing

1564
01:20:35,509 --> 01:20:38,379
"Rainbow Connection"
with Kermit the Frog.

1565
01:20:38,446 --> 01:20:41,415
‐ Oh! ‐ You have made
duets with Robin Thicke

1566
01:20:41,482 --> 01:20:44,051
‐ and Kermit the Frog? ‐ Wow.

1567
01:20:44,118 --> 01:20:47,221
I don't wanna know who's
better. I don't wanna know.

1568
01:20:47,288 --> 01:20:50,224
Honestly, I was just so thrilled

1569
01:20:50,291 --> 01:20:52,126
to hear all the nice
things you guys said.

1570
01:20:52,193 --> 01:20:54,595
And I just feel more
like an entertainer now,

1571
01:20:54,662 --> 01:20:57,565
just as a whole,
and I think just‐‐

1572
01:20:57,631 --> 01:21:00,901
I'm just excited for what this
means for the rest of my career, too.

1573
01:21:00,968 --> 01:21:03,971
‐ Yay. ‐ And just‐‐
it's all good things.

1574
01:21:04,038 --> 01:21:05,873
And again,
we are privileged to have you here.

1575
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:09,210
‐ Thank you so much. ‐
Can I just say thank you

1576
01:21:09,276 --> 01:21:11,912
to my brother
Craig Robinson as well,

1577

"The Masked Dancer."

1578
01:21:15,249 --> 01:21:16,526

1581

it's our most competitive
finale to date.

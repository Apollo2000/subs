59
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,529
When I'm walking down the street,
little kids, including some babies,

60
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:59,573
they look at me
and they're just like,

61
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:01,638
"you're the dumbest
judge in the world.

62

Even I get stuff more than you."

63
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:07,436

been in even one 'hangover' movie?

64
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,250
Really? Have... are you
that much better than me?

65
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:14,610
I've been a doctor, I've been a comedian,
and an instagram bikini model.

00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:18,405
I will prove to you
that I am not a joke."

67
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:21,825
this is why I brought all these amazing
books to bone up on my knowledge.

68
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:24,620

"actors with pimples."

69
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,788

70
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,624

detective work on "reno 911."

85
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:13,710
Oh, I'm ready because
my secret power in all of this

86
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,255
- is that I got mama ears.

90
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:27,619

That's your mama ears.

00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:27,636
- we've ever had in the history of "masked singer."
- it is.

131
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:32,265
- Well said.
- And I can't believe someone is going home tonight.

132
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:35,310
All right, well,
let's get to it. We're upping the ante

133
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:37,854
with some game-changing
clues coming straight

134
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:41,024
from the famous friends
and families of our singers.

135
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:46,154
- Whoo!
- And tonight we're kicking off our group a finals

136
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:49,157
with our solar
superstar the sun.

137
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:57,207
<i>I never thought returning
to the stage after all these months</i>

138
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,584
<i>would have looked
quite like this,</i>

139
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:03,380
<i>but performing again
feels absolutely radiant.</i>

140
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:07,384
Enough of me carrying on. Honey,
take the wheel.

141
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:11,388
Like so many people,
the last few months of isolation

142
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:13,368
have been challenging
for me and sun.

143
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:16,560
Wind chimes. Someone
from the windy city maybe.

144
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,707
You know, we've tried to make
the most of our unexpected time off

145
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:22,649
by taking our rv
out on road trips.

146
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:25,444
Though I'm always
wasting fuel blasting the ac

147
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:28,613
'cause she's so dang hot.

148
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:31,783
We realized we don't need much to be happy,
you know?

149
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:34,411
<i>We just need each other.</i>

150
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:38,039
But I know sun really
misses entertaining people.

151
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,271
<i>You know, she's never taken this
long of a break from spreading her light</i>

152
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:45,525
- <i>to the rest of the world.</i>
- Lots of cows. Maybe they have a ranch?

153
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:48,383
So, sun,

Such an awesome job!

197
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:31,649
The sun,
I love you! Ha! I am obsessed.

198
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:35,133
Let me tell you something.
You chose the perfect costume

199
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,135
for all that you do, baby.

200
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,366
'cause you could not
have shown brighter tonight.

201
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,701
Yeah. - Good job.

202
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:44,621
Absolutely.
Tonight was really sultry,

203
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:47,406
and I think that we always
worry after a few performances,

204
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,542
- will they be able to show us something new?
- Right.

205
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,794
That was a whole 'nother
dimension. That was wonderful.

206
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,235
Yeah. - I would agree.

207
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:57,280
All right, well,
tonight we are to be greeted by

208
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:59,532
a close,
personal friend of our singers,

209
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:04,204
who is going to deliver a
genuinely game-changing clue.

210
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,184
But because they
can't be here in person,

211
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:10,251
we've come up
with a futuristic fix.

212
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,045
What is that? - Yeah!

213
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:16,341
- Yeah.
- That's so cute.

214
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,071
It's an actual, like,
real life robot.

215
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:20,011
It's like "the jetsons."

216
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:21,240
yeah, it is like "the jetsons."

217
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,139
little closer.

218
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:25,100
Stop. Okay.

219
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,518
You ready for this?

220
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:32,752
Now, panel,
I got you a game-changing clue.

221
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:35,505
The sun is actually golden.

222
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:41,116
Yep. She's got at least one
single that went certified gold.

223
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,284
Wow. Ooh.

224
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,347
Wow.

225
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,765
Picking up on anything?

226
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:48,518
- Okay, oh.
- Ken's trying to connect the dots.

227
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,103
Yes, I am. Yes,
I am. 'cause I...

228
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:52,043
Sun, I apologize ahead of time.

229
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:56,214
All right,
based on the clues we saw this week,

230
00:11:56,258 --> 00:12:00,093
I will go with katharine mcphee,
and I'll tell you why.

231
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:01,977
- That's good.
- Okay, gold record.

232
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,117
Katharine mcphee has a
gold record called "over it."

233
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:07,642
- yeah.
- But, kat, we're not over you.

234
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:10,520
Not by a long shot.

235
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:14,607
And in that clue package
we heard from her husband,

236
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:18,778
canadian producer david foster,
and let me tell you,

237
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,489
when he's not producing
albums by michael bublé

238
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:26,453
or barbra streisand,
this guy is a lumberjack to the hilt.

239
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:30,790
So, welcome to "the masked singer,"
katharine mcphee.

240
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,271
- Thank you.
- That's who I guessed it was last time.

241
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:36,463
- No. No, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

242
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,965
- What? - Absolutely not, no.

243
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:43,261
- What?
- You are so wrong because the person in that package

244
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:46,055
- was not a husband, okay? I'm a super sleuth.
- Ah.

245
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,202
- Let me just let you know something.
- Oh.

246
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,913
- The way he talked about that woman...
- Yeah.

247
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:54,689
...That's a boyfriend. Your
husband don't talk about you like that.

248
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,775
- Boyfriend and a half.
- Yeah.

249
00:12:56,818 --> 00:13:00,612
- That's a boyfriend?
- Listen, I've been a wife a couple of times, ken.

250
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,551
- Okay. Okay.
- All right? And the reason why

251
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,695
was 'cause I know how
husbands talk about...

252
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,623
All right?

253
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,228
- So let's take out everybody who's married, right?
- Okay.

254
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,855
- Okay, okay.
- So let's walk it down.

255
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,523
When you dropped
down on that ground,

256
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,358
- you saw those are some young knees.
- Yeah.

257
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,693
- She got the... - Yeah, yeah.

258
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:24,302
So I was thinking at
first maybe it's jojo.

259
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,972
- Ah.
- But then I remember in the package,

260
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:31,059
the postcard,
and it said "from alaska."

261
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,872
- Ah.
- You know who's from alaska?

262
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,814
- No. - Jewel is from alaska.

263
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,107
- Oh. - Oh!

264
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,545
- Oh.
- Jewel is from alaska.

265
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,380
- That's a good guess.
- That's not bad.

266
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:45,573
- All right, that's a good one.
- To me, based off this powerhouse voice,

267
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:50,245
and there was also a castle in
the clue package for disney star.

268
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:52,455
Demi lovato.

269
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,582
And the chalk rock
in the blimp clue...

270
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,813
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes, the university of kansas.

271
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,773
Yeah, they, uh,
they have the chalk rock chant.

272
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,359
Okay, well,
demi lovato performed at the super bowl,

273
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:04,050
- in which kansas city won.
- Yeah, that's true.

274
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,655
- So maybe that's a connection.
- I love it.

275
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:09,430
Girl, you stretched that like a
piece of gum on an old shoe.

00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:51,366
<i>And while we're
loving our new fans,</i>

307
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:54,680
we can't forget the one that's
been with us since the beginning.

308
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:58,184
The owls? Oh, I know the owls.

309
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,667
They've been perching on
my arms for over 20 years now.

310
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,420
For two total opposites,
they really complement each other.

311
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:08,216
Sir owl always pushes
lady owl to believe in herself.

312
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:11,761
And lady owl? Well, she's finally
gotten him to settle down a bit

313
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:16,099
- with all that horsing around.
- I'm getting serious cowboy vibes.

314
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,870
He's got the louder
voice of the two,

315
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,872
and sometimes I feel
lady owl gets overlooked.

316
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,124
- Oh, that's the parthenon.
- There's one in nashville.

317
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,126
<i>So it's been
amazing to watch her</i>

318
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,276
<i>step out from under his
shadow and truly shine.</i>

319
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,655
I've seen these two pour their
hearts and souls into this competition.

320
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,617
- That a shirley temple? A roy rogers.
- Or a roy rogers.

321
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:38,246
I can't think of a more deserving
duo to take home the win.

- The tears. - Wow.

343
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:36,489
Breathtaking, indeed.

344
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:39,117
- Whoo.
- Nicole, talk to 'em.

345
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,037
Oh, my gosh. That was such
a beautiful version of that song.

346
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:46,207
Your harmonies were so beautiful,
and you have my heart.

347
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,729
I know you have america's heart,
and just thank you for that.

348
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:52,255
That was so special.

349
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:56,634
All right, now it's time to welcome
back the snow owls' famous companion

350
00:18:56,719 --> 00:19:00,096
with something we all want,
the game-changing clue.

351
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,430
R-r-robot.

352
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,727
- yeah! - Yeah!

353
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:10,481
Uh-oh,
I think the robot's drunk.

354
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:13,985
- We got a robot down!
- The robot is lit. I'll get it.

355
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,613
Oh! It's 2020. What
do you expect?

356
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:22,410
- Robot is drunk.
- Lil wayne is down.

357
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,515
Line of the year, robin.

358
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,517
Now you good? You straight?

359
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,416
All right, come on. This way.

360
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,751
Oh,
he about to go somewhere else.

361
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:33,212
Don't go off the stage.

362
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:35,756
All right, stop. Okay.

363
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,385
You ready for this?

364
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:42,346
Now, panel,
ready for a game-changing clue?

365
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,016
Two snow owls sitting in a tree,

366
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,477
k-I-s-s-I-n-g.

367
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:52,023
- Look at that kiss.
- Oh!

368
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,775
- Oh.
- That's not brother and sister.

369
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,612
- It's not donny and marie.
- No.

370
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,531
Okay,
so here's where I was going with it.

371
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:04,243
- I think it may be brad paisley...
- Ooh.

372
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:06,204
- ...And his wife kimberly.
- Ah.

373
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,684
Because she was in
the tv show "nashville."

374
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,436
- Oh, yeah.
- That's right.

375
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,753
Right? Which is where the
parthenon is in the package.

376
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,357
Look at you putting
those clues together.

377
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,901
And it was a little
horse in there.

378
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,360
- Yes.
- Final answer. That's my final answer.

379
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,070
All right. I like that.

380
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,864
- That's a great guess.
- That's a good guess.

381
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:25,201
But there was an empty
nest in the clue blimp.

382
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:29,018
And I believe that both of
their children have left the nest,

383
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,938
so I'm sticking with
my guess from last time,

384
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,774
- amy grant and vince gill.
- Oh.

385
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,442
I love me some amy grant.

386
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:39,237
Well, you made some good points,
but I'm thinking

387
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,780
a whole different direction.

388
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:44,386
- Danny devito and rhea perlman.
- Yeah!

389
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:48,454
Let me finish. The famous tree
friend that we saw in the package,

390
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:52,375
made of wood,
woody harrelson from "cheers."

391
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,104
huh? Are you following me, nick?

392
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:59,674
- No.
- And this week, they drank together a roy rogers,

393
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,797
which they serve in
a bar called "cheers."

394
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,616
this is danny devito,
rhea pearlman.

395
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,641
"the masked
singer" unites people.

396
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:12,687
It brings people together
on a show of love.

397
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,625
Come on back from stretchville,
ken.

398
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:16,669
You're gonna pull a muscle
with all that stretching.

399
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:19,110
Disagree to agree.

400
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,548
Either way,
we know they did an amazing performance,

401
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:24,468
so, ladies and gentlemen, please give
it up one more time for the snow owls.

402
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:27,201
Whoo!

403
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:30,683
<i>Do our panel's snow
owl guesses give you frostbite?</i>

404
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:32,623
<i>Tell us what you think.</i>

405
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:35,626
I think that kiss might have
ruffled some feathers, for sure.

406
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:38,440
Here's hoping we didn't
give too much away

407
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,589
because we've
still got big plans

408
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,718
to fly our way
into the super six.

409
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:46,595
<i>Coming up,

00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,975

- <i>And later,</i>

412
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,539
<i>it's a reveal no one saw coming.</i>

413
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:55,730
Take it off! Take it off!

414
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:06,032
Aww, how am I supposed
to focus on the competition

415
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:08,284
when all I can
think about is nick?

416
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:11,704

423
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:36,645
Next up,
it's our favorite singing carbohydrate.

424
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:40,399
Let's hear from a famous friend
of this highly caloric movie snack.

425
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:43,903
Here some more
clues about the popcorn.

426
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,595
<i>Every time I get
to walk out onto this stage,</i>

427
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:54,121
it feels so great knowing that I'm
bring a little happiness to the world.

428
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:57,625
But I couldn't do it without
my own personal cheerleader,

429
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:02,546
her royal highness,
my queen bff.

430
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,715
I know popcorn
through a mutual friend.

431
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,759
Technically, a queen associate.

432
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:09,762
Maybe spent some time in
russia or married a russian?

433
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:13,808
I don't have to tell you,
my bff has an amazing voice,

434
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:17,353
but I can never get her to sing
at my famous karaoke parties.

435
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:20,064
Such a royal pain.

436
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:21,835
Could be in the fashion world?

437
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,235
At least she's
singing for you all here

438
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:28,406
on a stage I've been on before. Dun,
dun, dun.

439
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:30,616
Oh, she's been on the show!

440
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,120
Now everyone can
revel in her majesty.

441
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:37,540
Popcorn,
you know I'm always in your court.

442
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,585

471
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:19,266
- yes, popcorn!
- What's popping?

472
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,603
- That was popping.
- Wait a second.

473
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:25,231
- What was that?
- What do you mean?

474
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:27,586
She just totally
flipped the whole script.

475
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,402
- Right.
- Just when I thought I knew exactly who it was,

476
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:33,258
she comes out and she started the
song with a completely different tone

477
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:36,136
in the highest register. I'm
completely confused right now.

478
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,286
That was amazing. Wow.

479
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:43,352
You know you are a diva when
you point to the note before you hit it.

480
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:46,293
- Hey.
- And you're like, it's going right there.

481
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:48,212
It's going right there.

482
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:50,798
All right,
let's welcome back popcorn's famous friend

483
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,551
- with another game-changing clue.
- Ooh.

484
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:56,136
Robot, roll on out.

485
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:00,724
Yeah!

486
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:05,179
Hey.

487
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,505
To my friend up there,
not only have I been here before,

488
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:16,657
but in the show's history,
one of you has also guessed popcorn.

489
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:19,577
- Wow.
- Oh. That's very interesting.

490
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,205
- Oh, I think I know.
- One of you has guessed popcorn.

491
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:26,458
So, this artist we definitely
have mentioned her before.

492
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:30,462
In the clue packages previously, we've
seen a crimp iron and her hair is crimpy.

493
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:34,717
And the thing that made me say,
oh, yeah, was the sewing kit.

494
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:39,930
- Yes.
- Taylor. Taylor dayne is on this stage right now.

495
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:41,243
- Good guess.
- I don't know about that.

496
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:44,101
- Yeah.
- I'm not sure that's taylor's tone.

497
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:47,104
- Oh.
- Who do we think would be her famous friend

498
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:48,417
that's been on the show before?

499
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:52,109
I think one of her best
friends is leah remini.

500
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:53,964
- Ooh.
- Now she wasn't on that stage, but she was on this stage.

501
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:55,340
Yes. - Ah.

502
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:57,823
Let me blow all
these theories up right now.

503
00:26:57,867 --> 00:27:00,534
- Please.
- All of these heavy new york clues,

504
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:04,788
I don't know. I just feel like one
of the ultimate queens of new york

505
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,583
Oh!

506
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:11,378
So, I'm gonna drop my pen like it's
a mic and I don't know what it means.

507
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:13,650
- That's all I got.
- I like it, I like it.

508
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:16,634
And cyndi has an incredible
range. She can go way up.

509
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:19,219
- Yes.
- That is a good guess.

510
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:23,682
But I know exactly who
this raspy voice may be.

511
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:27,497
- I'm thinking anita baker.
- Anita baker?

512
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:31,607
Royalty in the package. Anita
baker's the queen of r&b soul.

513
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:34,379
- Yep.
- Deer in the package. A type of deer is hart.

514
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:37,613
One of her hits is
"heart and soul."

515
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:41,617
great guess. Proud of myself.

516
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,680
- No.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

517
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:47,373
Is this popcorn anika noni rose?

518
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,561
- She fits kinda like the body type.
- Okay.

519
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,104
- Physique.
- That's a good one, too.

520
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:53,523
- That's a good one.
- You guys ought to be glad I'm here.

521
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:57,216
- You already dropped your mic.
- Oh, sorry. I picked it back up.

522
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,718
Let me sit back down.
No more clues. I'm sorry.

523
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:03,722
There it is. All right,
lots of great guesses.

524
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:07,393
Ladies and gentlemen,
keep it going for the popcorn!

525
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:09,144
She's a legend.

526
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:12,398
<i>The panel gave us all
sorts of guesses for the popcorn,</i>

527
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:16,193
<i>but did it just leave
us corn-fused?</i>

528
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:21,448
It's been an evening
of epic performances,

529
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:24,451
but now it's time for
the studio audience,

530
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:27,724
our panel,
and our pre-selected superfans at home

531
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:31,125
to exercise their right to vote
for their favorite of the night.

532
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,796
The two singers with
the least amount of votes

533
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,717
will battle it out in our
"masked singer" smackdown.

534
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:41,427
This is so hard.

535
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:45,534
The votes are in,
and the first place finisher

536
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:49,226
going directly to
the super six is...

537
00:28:57,403 --> 00:29:01,071
- The sun!
- <i>♪ I'm walking on sunshine</i>

538
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:02,509
<i>♪ whoa</i>

539
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:05,284
- <i>♪ I'm walking on sunshine</i> - oh,
the sun!

540
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:09,349
Congratulations, sun. You
have officially made it to our super six.

541
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:14,001
- Now hit the tunnel.
- <i>♪ And don't it feel good?</i>

542
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:19,631
That means our smackdown is
between the snow owls and the popcorn.

543
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:21,759
Oh, the smackdowns are back!

544
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:24,740
I can't believe only one more
gets to go through to the super six.

545
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:27,765
- I know.
- All right, which insanely talented celeb

546
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:31,059
is getting unmasked?
Find out next.

547
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:37,233
<i>♪ Who is that?</i>

548
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:46,408
- <i>♪ who is that?</i>
- Welcome back to the group a finals on "the masked singer."

549
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:49,328
yay, nick cannon!

550
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:52,309
Now, before the break,
the sun secured a spot in the super six.

551
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,416
- Yeah!
- So, who will join her?

552
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:59,254
The snow owls and the
popcorn will have one last chance

553
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:03,425
to prove they're in it to
win it in the smackdown.

554
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:10,098
- Whoa!
- Oh, it's gonna be good.

555
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,184
They both sing, our panel votes,

556
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:17,064
one moves on to the super six,
and the other must take it off.

557
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:24,363
It's time to smackdown!

558
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,615
- Whoo! Let's go! - Hey!

559
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,243
Weighing in at
over 300 pounds...

560
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:32,120
- Whoo! - ...It's the snow owls.

561
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:36,186
Yeah!

562
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:39,253
Yeah! All righty, the rumble.

563
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:42,214
And a small snack
with a big bite,

564
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:43,632
it's the popcorn!

565
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:49,728
Show 'em! You show those owls!

566
00:30:55,813 --> 00:30:58,500
It is a battle between
the birds of prey

567
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:02,150
and complex carbohydrates.
It's anybody's game.

568
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:06,113
Okay, snow owls,
you're up first.

569
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:10,784

you do it like that.

- When you do it.

in "masked singer" history.

It's true because
going into this,

608
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:39,474
I was thinking, okay,
it's the lovebirds competing

609
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,519
with this empowered,
strong female woman.

- Yep.

00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:47,357
Who's game is it
now? I don't know.

612
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:49,671
Oh, my god.

613
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,506
You know what? I'm so torn.

614
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:55,365
Am I being greedy if I ask them
if they can sing something else?

615
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:58,660
It would be easier if they
were a little more mean.

616
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:01,121
Let's get to the smacktalk then,
all right?

617
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:04,082
- Uh-oh. - Snow owls, please,

618
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:07,294
why do you think
you beat the popcorn?

619
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:12,758
We went out on a limb and gave our
crowning achievement performance.

620
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:17,387
Yes! Out on a limb! Yes!

621
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:21,558
Well, I mean,
popcorn came here to pop.

622
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,520
Yes!

623
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:27,375
That's as gangsta as it's going to get,
niecy.

624
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,503
- Oh, man!
- Yeah, exactly. You're right, you're right, you're right.

625
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:32,778
All right, well, panel,
it's time to vote.

626
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,382
- Oh, man.
- You guys gotta make that decision

627
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:37,510
on who you think
won the smackdown.

628
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:41,787
- Oh, my gosh.
- It's so hard. This is so difficult.

629
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:52,255
Snow owls, popcorn, only one of
you will be advancing to the super six.

630
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:54,633
The votes have been tallied,

631
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:58,470
and the singer going home is...

632
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,359
In this epic smackdown,

633
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:15,529
the winner who
gets to keep it on

634
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:19,511
and advance to
the super six is...

635
00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:20,617
This is big.

636
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,861
Oh, no. I don't want to
know. I don't want to know.

637
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:32,379
- Popcorn! -

638
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:35,757
- popcorn, congratulations.
- Yay for popcorn.

639
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:39,052
The golden mask is
still within your reach.

640
00:35:39,096 --> 00:35:42,639
We'll see you soon
for our super six.

641
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:45,100
Oh,
makes me so sad for the owls.

642
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:50,667
Snow owls, I'm so disappointed and
sorry that you guys are not moving forward.

643
00:35:50,691 --> 00:35:54,776
But america can't wait
to see your famous faces.

644
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,070
Yeah!

645
00:35:57,114 --> 00:36:01,116
Before we do,
let's give you guys one final clue.

646
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:05,287
Dancers,
let's help the owls out of their egg.

647
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:08,248
- What? - Oh!

648
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:10,041
They're gonna hatch.

649
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:13,628
- Oh, my gosh! - Wow.

650
00:36:13,714 --> 00:36:18,194
Oh, they're beautiful. Oh,
my god.

651
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:21,094
- Gorgeous.
- Now you've seen their bodies.

652
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:26,641
Men in black, let's bring out the first
impression guesses from the vault.

653
00:36:26,727 --> 00:36:31,146
- Oh, no!
- Men in black, bring 'em out.

654
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:34,836
Yeah, I don't think we need
to do that. We can just...

655
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,796
Yeah,
we don't need to do that, nick.

656
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,339
No,
I think we definitely need to do this.

657
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,841
- This is my favorite part.
- No.

658
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,364
- Mr. Robin thicke... - Yes.

659
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:46,119
...Your first impression guess
was amy grant and vince gill.

660
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:48,205
- Sticking with it?
- Absolutely.

661
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,268
There's been so many
references to nashville.

662
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:53,188
And I think vince gill is one of
the great country singers of all time.

663
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:54,606
- Yep.
- So I'm going to stick with it,

664
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,774
and I'm gonna go with
vince gill and amy grant.

665
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:58,632
That's real, real good.

666
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:03,762
Jenny, you said maureen
mccormick and barry williams.

667
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,909
- That's good.
- Marsha, marsha, marsha.

668
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:10,018
- Sticking with the bradys?
- Well, you know, I was going with, like, tv iconic duos

669
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:15,148
like greg and marsha,
but now with the christmas clues.

670
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:16,775
- Yes.
- Him calling her the queen,

671
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,820
and she's the queen
of christian pop.

672
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:21,341
I feel like maybe
it is amy and vince.

673
00:37:21,365 --> 00:37:23,198
Yeah!

674
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:26,243
All right, well,
dr. Kenny ken ken.

675
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:27,619
Oh, god. I don't even...

676
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:33,458
First impression guess,
derek and julianne hough.

677
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:36,336
That's the most, like,
sane guess he's had.

678
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,692
Before they kissed,
that made a lot of sense.

679
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:44,219
I think on the first show,
the big clue was a pearl.

680
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:46,388
Rhea perlman.

681
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:50,433
Furthermore,
d that dropped, d for danny.

682
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:53,853
This is danny devito
and rhea perlman.

683
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:55,792
- He's laughing at you.
- No, he's nervous.

684
00:37:55,816 --> 00:37:58,358
I'm gonna throw my pen at you.

685
00:37:58,402 --> 00:38:01,069
- Nicole?
- Oh, my god. What did you say, nicole?

686
00:38:01,104 --> 00:38:04,447
- Donny and marie osmond.
- It's not bad.

687
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:07,053
So I thought donny could come back,
take it all with his sister,

688
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:11,204
but I do not believe that is
donny and marie anymore.

689
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:14,291
- Yes.
- Okay? Nick, that has been driving me crazy

690
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:17,043
because as soon as they
just opened their little beaks,

691
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:21,256
I was like,
I feel like I know those voices.

692
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,800
- Yeah.
- But then there was that smackdown

693
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,219
that I was like,
I know that voice.

694
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:29,055
- Really?
- Yes. And now seeing their bodies,

695
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:33,643
I believe that this is clint
black and lisa hartman.

696
00:38:33,729 --> 00:38:36,771
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, that's very interesting.

697
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,441
That's because
this week I was like,

698
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:41,735
is that a shirley temple,
a roy rogers?

699
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:44,612
And I think clint black did
a song with roy rogers, so...

700
00:38:44,698 --> 00:38:46,634
- Oh, my god. That's awesome.
- Really?

701
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:49,117
- Yeah. - All right, now, niecy.

702
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:52,120
- Yes.
- We are dying to hear your final guess

703
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:54,706
on who you think the
snow owls could be.

704
00:38:54,791 --> 00:39:00,378
Initially when I unpacked it, I had
come up with brad paisley and his wife,

705
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:04,424
but now I'm gonna put
all my money down...

706
00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:08,698
- Uh-oh.
- ...On harry hamlin and lisa rinna. Deal with it.

707
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:11,723
Whoa! - Jenny: Oh!

708
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:14,559
I just feel like if
lisa rinna was on the show,

709
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:16,706
she would look like
that in that costume.

710
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:19,167
- All right.
- By the way, this is a huge moment.

711
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:21,336
This is our first double
unmasking on "the masked singer."

712
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,463
- whoo.
- This is history, you're right.

713
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:26,112
- Big.
- Well, let's see who they are!

714
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:29,344
- Yes!
- All right, and here we go.

715
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:33,536
Let's see if any of
you are even close.

716
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:38,249
Snow owls,
show us your famous faces.

717
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:43,524
- Take it off! Take it off!
<i>- ♪ Who are you?</i>

718
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:46,424

725

Ladies and gentlemen,
make some noise

726
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:12,242
for country superstar,
legendary actress, and singer

727
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:17,705
clint black and
lisa hartman black.

728
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:21,584
- Nicole!
- Nicole, you were right.

729
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:24,587
- How did you get it?
- Clint's voice, honestly.

730
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:27,465
- Yeah!
- It was clint's voice, but, lisa, like,

731
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:31,136
I'm so glad you came on this show
because you were unbelievable.

732
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:33,888
- Your voice, it was so beautiful.
- Totally.

733
00:40:33,974 --> 00:40:35,243
- Yeah.
- Y'all need to release something.

734
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:37,684
We should sing together.

735
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:40,395
So what was it like
being a snow owl?

736
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:44,335
Well, I mean, when I first saw
the costumes, I actually cried.

737
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:47,569
- Oh, wow.
- Because they're so beautiful, but they're so sweet.

738
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,632
- Yeah.
- I couldn't wait to get into them.

739
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:52,176
- Aww.
- I said it before, but y'all were truly

740
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,825
the heart of this show.

741
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:56,619
- Yeah.
- It's true. We're gonna miss our lovebirds.

742
00:40:56,705 --> 00:41:00,518
- Thank you.
- You guys are no simon cowell,

743
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:02,625
that's all I'm gonna say.

744
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:05,712
Y'all are so nice and made
us feel good every time.

745
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:09,757
Such a wonderful job. Thank
you to the queen niecy nash.

746
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:10,862
- We love you, niecy. - Whoo!

747
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:12,760
- Niecy nash!
- But right now,

748

749
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:19,350

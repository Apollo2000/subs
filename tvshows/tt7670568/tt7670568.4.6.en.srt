I think you might be unbeatable.

186
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:09,381
Absolutely. Last week he
focused more on his falsetto.

187
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:12,759
This week he sang in
his more natural belt voice

188
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:15,053
- and he totally switched it up.
- Totally.

189
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:18,765
- Thank you.
- Yeah, mushroom, you know what you're doing.

It's not a brain.

that it wasn't o.J. It was tang.

- As ridiculous as that sounds, that is the truth.

217
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,776
Thank you, daddy! And also,
that is not a red brain.

218
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,028
That is a red bone.

219
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:58,551
One of his most successful
singles. That's a red bone.

220
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,094
- Nick: Wait, when di...
- Donald glover.

221
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,702
- Aren't you a doctor? - What?

222
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:06,206
I will take a bite to prove to
you that this is not a bone.

223
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,061
No, no. No, don't... don't eat. Okay,
look, I was stretching.

224
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:11,022
Daddy, don't eat it. Daddy,
don't eat that. No, no, no.

225
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,066
- Daddy, I don't want you to eat...
- nicole: Ooh, it's jiggly.

226
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:16,007
- Oh, my god.
- Ken: No, no, no. I don't want... oh!

227
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:19,219
- Robin: Oh! - Nicole: Ahh!

228
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:22,389
- What... what flavor is that brain?
- Strawberry.

229
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,621
I don't know if
this is the person,

230
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:30,438
but I remembered seeing
something about queen, bee, proud.

231
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,857
Maybe it's somebody from
the lgbtq+ communities.

232
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:36,820
And not many people
can hold notes out like that

233
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,155
and who are that
technically talented.

234
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:43,910
So I was like,
it could be adam lambert.

235
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,995
Wayne: For me,
it's not adam lambert.

236
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:50,083
Adam has a weirdly,
freakishly surreal tone.

237
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:54,295
But just from the clue package,
"mean girls," high school,

238
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:59,217
being a bit different, I got willow
smith before the singing happened.

239
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:03,638
- Ah.
- And then I thought, okay, maybe it is jaden.

240
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:08,371
And there was the red brain.
Maybe there's a link to "red table talk,"

241
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,998
- which is intellectual conversation.
- Oh, my gosh. I like it.

242
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,773
- Yes.
- I'm thinking jaden smith.

243
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,546
I agree. After that vocal,
that's a very good guess.

244
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:20,071
And he has a new album, so this
might be a great opportunity for him

245
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,949
- to showcase his voice.
- Okay, that's good. Yeah, yeah.

246
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:26,119
One thing we all know is that
performance was outstanding.

247
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:27,432
- Yes. - Whoo!

248
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,392
Nick: Keep it going

249
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,292
Wait,
is donald glover that tall though?

250
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:35,003
Well, is nick cannon that
short? The answer to both is yes.

251
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:38,423
- Nick, can you give us a clue?
- No.

252
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:41,718

Broccoli rocking the stage.

- Broc star!
- Nicole: Oh, my gosh.

318

Nick,
I usually go for the tall ones,

319
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:46,546
but broccoli has my
heart this season.

320
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,465
- Totally.
- Especially after he just serenaded me

321
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,945
with that little
broc fro of his.

322
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,177
All right, there it is.

323
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:56,075
Yeah. What I really liked about it
was the first time you performed,

324
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,266
it was all up tempo,
high energy.

325
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,893
And this week,
I feel like we really got to...

326
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,957
A sense of your sensitive side,
you know what I mean?

327
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,272
That maybe when you're at home,

328
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,543
you just be

330

I've been there,
and I'll do it again.

331
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,614
All right, well,
let's grab broccoli's magic lamp.

332
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:16,325

- Robin: Roulette.

338
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:41,934
- He's a player.
- Take this clue for a spin,

339
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:45,772
and you may land on my identity

340

341

Ooh, lucky. Okay, well,
we have the roulette wheel.

- Yeah. Yes.

- Mr. Vegas, wayne newton? - Oh!

344
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,912
Nicole: Okay? There was
a guitar in the package.

345
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,706
Wayne plays guitar. Was
wayne in "goodfellas" or...

346
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,291
- No.
- Wasn't he in "the hangover"?

347
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:08,147
- I think "the hangover"...
- Yeah, there it is.

348
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:09,356
- No, it's fine.
- Ken was in that movie.

349
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,923
- Get out of here. - Yeah.

350
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:15,093
- Ken, do you know who it is?
- I've been wishing that martin short,

351
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:19,013
one of my favorite comedic idols,
that he could be on this.

352
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:21,766
Saw canadian
bacon in the package.

353
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,436
You know, one of canada's
best. The anchor for "captain ron,"

354
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,148
- his movie with kurt russell. He is the real deal.
- Ooh.

355
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:31,087
- He can do it all.
- Broadway star, too.

356
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,152
Yes, broadway star as well.

357
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:36,739
You know, this is my annual
wish. Martin short, please.

358
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:38,511
- All right. - Please be you.

359
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:40,618
Genie,
rubbing the lamp for martin short.

360
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:43,037
I agree completely with ken.

361
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:45,665
Nick, that's on the record.

362
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,437
The winner of "the masked
singer" agreed with my guess.

363
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,461
That's a first.

364
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:53,464
Um,
I think I unlocked a major clue.

365
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,883
- Okay.
- Okay, bear with me. Bear with me.

366
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,988
- We're ready for it.
- Okay, so first from the clue package,

367
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,907
and it was an
incomplete phone number.

368
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:02,932
So I broke it down,
and I got a bunch of different words.

369
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:08,020
But the one that hit was frank.
It spelled frank, those numbers.

370
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,292
- Are you serious, jenny?
- Nick: Jenny's really working over here.

371
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:14,944
And then I thought about this
broadway play called "the producers."

372
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:18,990
and jason alexander
was in "the producers."

373
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:22,451
and then I was like, well,
how does jason connect to frank?

374
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,122
And I realized frank costanza
is he dad on "seinfeld."

375
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:29,542
- ken: Wow.
- So maybe jason alexander.

376
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,063
- Nicole: Wow. That is great, jenny.
- Robin: Great job.

377
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:34,191
- I like it. I like it.
- Thanks. I'm exhausted.

378
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,485
- I'm gonna go to sleep now. Good night.
- Ken: Yeah. Good night.

379
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:41,012
Nick: Well, we can all agree
that we can't sleep on this guy.

380
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:44,307
Ladies and gentlemen,
one more time. Broccoli!

enough of a nutritious punch</i>

<i>to make it to the group c final?</i>

383
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,650
Tonight I showed the
panel my mushy side

384
00:19:54,685 --> 00:19:56,986
and they ate it up.
Especially nicole.

385
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,698
Things were getting steamy
between the two of us.

386
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:04,452
Nick: <i>When we return,
things get heated.</i>

387
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:08,456
- I refute everything that you just said, ken.
- Whoa! Come back!

388
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:11,751
<i>And you don't want to
miss this epic unmasking.</i>

390
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,738
Jenny: I kind of love
this magic element.

391
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:24,764
Like, if we could make a wish
and I can make ken disappear.

392
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:28,309
If I had a magic power, it would be
able to see through the costumes.

393
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:30,956
- That's actually a good one.
- Robin, do you... would you wish for a magic power?

394
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,233
- What would your magic wish be?
- Oh, to comfort and console

395
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:38,486
- the ills of the human spirit.
- Wow.

396
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:39,695

456
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:52,138
- Yay!
- Satisfaction from the squiggly monster.

457
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:56,434
Awesome job. Ken, you still over
there getting some satisfaction?

458
00:23:56,477 --> 00:24:00,146
Yes,
I... very satisfying performance.

459
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:04,336
That might be the most just
fun performance of the night.

460
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,320
You're incredibly entertaining,
but tonight you showed you got some range.

461
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:11,073
- You can sing. You can really sing.
- Yeah.

462
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:15,202
Well, let's grab ahold of squiggly
monster's magic lamp to get another clue.

463
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:17,099
Men in black,
bring out the lamp.

464
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:18,372
Yeah, yeah. Clue, clue.

465
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:22,209
<i>( music playing )</i>

466
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,296
bring out the lamp.

467
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:28,966
Right, uh, squiggly,
I think you got a little too many hands.

468
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,384
I can rub this for you.

469
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:33,929
<i>( chiming )</i>

470
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,640
judges: Whoa.

471
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:41,020
I'm here to "bear" it all. Yes,
I said that.

472
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:44,648
And that starts with
this very cuddly clue.

473
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:47,151
Nick: All right,
you guys picking up on anything?

474
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:49,904
- Yes, I am, actually, nick.
- Uh-oh. Our clue expert.

475
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:52,156
You know,
I was thinking of this person,

476
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,493
and then that clue
made it say yes.

477
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:57,556
He said laughter is
the best medicine.

478
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,164
This man was a doctor
on a show called "becker."

479
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,541
- ooh.
- Also, there was a father figure reference

480
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,084
in the first package.

481
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:06,212
He was also in "three
men and a baby."

482
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,464
now the teddy bear
comes out. It's ted danson!

483
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:09,902
- Robin: Yeah. - Ken: I like it.

484
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:12,426
- Oh, go off, jenny.
- I like it.

485
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,012
Robin: Well, I'm thinking,
so the teddy bear,

486
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:17,097
now this guy was
in the movie "ted 2."

487
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:19,225
and there was a
pineapple in the package.

488
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,602
He was in "the spongebob movie,"

489
00:25:21,646 --> 00:25:24,438
who lives in a
pineapple under the sea.

490
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:26,482
I'm gonna go with
david squigglehoff.

491
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:29,944
- Jenny: Oh! - Nick: The hoff?

492
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:32,112
- I'm gonna go with the hoff.
- The height is...

493
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:34,426
- He's a great singer. - I like.

494
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,659
All right, ken,
can you top that?

495
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,745
I just can't get politicians out
of my mind grapes right now

496
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:42,957
because everything... when he
was talking about inconvenient truth,

497
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,544
it could be former vice
president al gore. I'm just saying.

498
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:48,671
It could be just
someone... Hear me out.

499
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:51,090
Just trying to
connect everything.

500
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:55,010
Al gore, he had an oscar-winning
documentary "inconvenient truth."

501
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,638
- oh, okay.
- Lots of comedy clues.

502
00:25:57,682 --> 00:26:01,141
Al gore once hosted
"snl" back in 2002.

503
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,561
Also, ted, teddy bear.

504
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:07,439
Al gore has given
many ted talks.

505
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:10,526
Former vice president al gore.

506
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:14,154
You know what? I'm gonna go
ahead and rock with ken... ken again.

507
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:16,574
- Again? - I feel it's the...

508
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:19,243
There's something
wrong here. Hold on.

509
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:22,037
In looking at the clue,
the first shot

510
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,976
was something that
looked like the oval office,

511
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,874
so you think politics.

512
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:29,003
Later,
you got the vibe that he is a funny person.

513
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:32,047
Likes merging the worlds
of comedy and politics.

514
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:36,385
There are people that do that. Trevor noah,
stephen colbert.

515
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:39,471
But the "inconvenient
truth" was such a big clue.

516
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:42,308
I'm gonna have to go more
so with al gore on this one.

517
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,102
- Jenny: Wow.
- Agreeing with ken for the second time.

518
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:47,229
- Twice. - Wait.

519
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:49,585
Hold on, hold on. Squiggly
monster has something to say.

520
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:52,359
- Ken: Whoa.
- Nick, I actually have something for you.

521
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:54,403
- I actually do. - Uh-oh.

522
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:57,384
- Because I love nick.
- Hey, I love you, too, squiggly monster.

523
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:00,951
- Yeah!
- This is for you. I know you love hats.

524
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:03,454
- I do.
- And I'm not just kissing up. I hope you love it.

525
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:06,540
- This is... - Aww.

526
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:07,541
- Oh, look at that!
- Nicole: Hey!

527
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:10,711
Ken: Wow! Look at that.

528
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:13,817
Mr. Squiggle, mr. Squiggle,
are there any clues that go with it?

529
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:16,921
I don't think it's a clue. I just
think he genuinely likes me.

530
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:20,949
Well, I think you guys are
looking for some more clues.

531
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,390
So, we've been getting a lot
of questions about our singers,

532
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:26,226
and one of our
fans wants to know...

533
00:27:29,139 --> 00:27:32,316
Oh, yes, I'm married. But, nick,
I never got your wedding gift.

534
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:36,362
- Classic gore.
- Does that help anything?

535
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:39,865
- That narrows things down.
- Right. Not at all basically, nick, not at all.

536
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:44,036
Well, I appreciate my gift. Y'all keep it
going for the amazing squiggly monster.

537
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,247
- Wayne: Good job, squiggly.
- Ken: Good job, squiggly.

538

Nick:<i> Are our panel's squiggly

I've had since I was a little squiggle.

541
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:02,262
I just hope it was enough to get
me elected into the group c finals.

00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:39,082
And I saw you hopping up and down
afterwards like you were proud of yourself.

610
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:41,315
You should be! 'cause
that was amazing.

611
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:45,402
- Robin: Yeah!
- Wayne: Yeah, I'm so floored by you.

612
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:50,073
I know from being in that experience,
if you keep evolving,

613
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:53,338
there's no doubt that we will not
be seeing you at the end of this show

614
00:31:53,362 --> 00:31:55,495
- winning the competition.
- Nicole: Yeah!

615
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:59,249
Reverend wayne brady,
ladies and gentlemen.

616
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:02,669
- Wow.
- Nick: We love it. Well, it is time

617
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:04,671
to bring out the magic lamp.

618
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:07,174
<i>( music playing )</i>

619
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:14,951
all right, jellyfish, you ready?

620
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,850
<i>( chiming )</i>

621
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:18,977
- robin: Whoa!
- Nicole: Oh, ho, ho, ho.

622
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:20,498
- That was a big one. - Whoa.

623
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,397
- Robin: Roar. - What?

624
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:25,025
If you can earn your stripes
and pounce on this clue...

625
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:26,234
( purrs )

626
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,340
( purrs ) she was rolling that.

627
00:32:28,364 --> 00:32:31,073
All right,
you guys picking up on anything?

628
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:34,179
I'm picking up on something. I was
thinking about in the clue package

629
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:36,097
how it said,
"my dad took me to gigs,"

630
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,557
and we're all
assuming it's her gigs.

631
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:40,165
Why couldn't it
be the dad's gigs?

632
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:42,918
- Ah.
- Robin: The dad's taking her to his gigs, right?

633
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:46,088
So, that kicked in
another idea. Is that a lion?

634
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:51,468
- That's a tiger.
- It's a tiger, magnum, p.U.

635
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:53,114
Robin: All right,
we're gonna say that's a lion.

636
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,472
That's lionel richie,
and you're sofia richie.

637
00:32:55,516 --> 00:32:57,349
- Jenny: Oh! - Ken: Whoa!

638
00:32:57,393 --> 00:33:00,102
Well, this is the lionel richie
pose on the album cover.

639
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,958
You had me on the brilliance of,
like,

640
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:05,126
( imitating robin ) "yes,
maybe the dad had gigs.

641
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,150
Is that a doggie?"

642
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:09,422
all right, ken,
then go ahead with your brilliant idea.

643
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:13,949
With pleasure. Okay,
I believe this is someone

644
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:16,535
from the popular netflix movie

645
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,473
"to all the boys
I've loved before."

646
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:22,124
lana condor. Amazing actress.

647
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:25,836
"xoxo" in the package.
She was in "x-men."

648
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:28,839
and name-drop, imdb alert,

649
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:31,842
I am attached to play
her father in a movie,

650
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:34,428
so winning the
golden mask trophy

651
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:38,390
will be the second best thing
to happen to her this year.

652
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:43,915
Also, big bird's in the
package. A condor is a big bird.

653
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,583
Wayne: The thing
that I'm worried about

654
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:48,817
is if anything that you just
said makes sense to me,

655
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:52,446
that means that I
need to be examined.

656
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:55,490
But you have agreed with
two of his guesses already.

657
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:58,285
But it will not be three,
my brother.

658
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:00,306
Let me break this down for you.

659
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,874
Okay, so, maybe they're
part of a show business family.

660
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,500
There was a family of four.

661
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:08,523
I'm thinking someone
like jamie lynn spears,

662
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:11,548
who has been in show
business for years.

663
00:34:11,592 --> 00:34:13,278
But then I went,
"oh! Wait a minute."

664
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:15,969
from the opening
tone of the voice,

665
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:18,013
it could also be halle bailey,

666
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:20,932
who was one part
of chloe x halle.

667
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:25,771
She is going to be the new ariel in
the remake of "the little mermaid."

668
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:29,357
- nicole: Yeah.
- And her father is the engineer of her career.

669
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:33,945
And "xoxo" is a beyoncé song,
and she signed them.

670
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:37,177
So that makes sense. I refute
everything that you've said, ken.

671
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:39,034
- Whoa! - And that is a tiger.

672
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:40,619
Not a liger. Not a leopard.

673
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:45,540
- I'm out. Carole baskin!
- Go! Go off, wayne!

674
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,417
- Come back!
- We've lost total control,

675
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:49,481
but ladies and gentlemen,

676
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:53,673
keep it going for the
one and only jellyfish.

677
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:55,487
That was definitely the
performance of the night.

678
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:57,302
Yeah.

679
00:34:57,346 --> 00:34:59,032
Nick: <i>Did the
jellyfish swim her way</i>

680
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:00,555
<i>into the group c finals?</i>

681
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,099
<i>Tell us what you think.</i>

682
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:07,145
Tonight,
group c brought the magic,

683
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:10,857
but sadly, someone is about to
disappear from the competition.

684
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:15,070
Studio audience, panel,
and our superfans at home,

685
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:17,239
time to vote for your favorite.

686
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:21,034
Only three will advance
to the group c finals.

687
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:23,662
The ballots have been cast.

688
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:27,124
The singer with the least
amount of votes will be unmasked.

689
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:29,042
( groans )

690
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:31,294
and that, my friends, is...

691
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

692
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,559
The singer with the
least amount of votes

693
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:48,061
headed home tonight is...

694
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:57,487
Squiggly monster.

695
00:35:57,531 --> 00:36:01,867
- Oh, my gosh!
- ( all groaning )

696
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,263
keep it going for
squiggly monster.

697
00:36:03,287 --> 00:36:05,495
The rest of you, congrats.

698
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:07,998
We'll see you in
the group c finals.

699
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,936
Come on,
squiggly. You just step down here.

700
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,085
- Robin: Squiggly! - Squiggly!

701
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:15,817
Squiggly, I mean,
you put up an incredible fight.

702
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:17,485
And there's a silver
lining right now.

703
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,237
Even though you're not
going to make it through,

704
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:21,156
we get to see who's behind the mask,
right?

705
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,323
- Yeah! - Nicole: Yeah!

706
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,472
- Ken: Yes. - But first,

707
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:28,852
let's retrieve the panel's first
impression guesses from the vault.

708
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:31,062
Oh,
my god. Do not bring these out.

709
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:33,982
Nick: <i>Men in black,
bring 'em out.</i>

710
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:39,007
If your first impression guesses
are correct, you get a point.

711
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:40,280
Oh, my gosh.

712
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:46,828
Jenny's first impression
was bob saget.

713
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,600
Jenny: Yeah, you know what?

714
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:50,351
That was my first
impression guess,

715
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:54,127
and then the clues on this show
can just screw with your mind.

716
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:55,940
So it was taking me in
all different directions.

717
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:58,882
I originally was thinking
maybe al franken.

718
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:00,884
Then I thought maybe ted danson

719
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:02,822
because, you know,
the teddy bear.

720
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:06,598
But then, you know,
I just... Going back to my initial gut.

721
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:10,894
Father figure,
"full house." and then I saw the dj.

722
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:13,021
- D.J. "full house." hello.
- Oh.

723
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:16,191
I'm gonna go back and stick
with my first impression guess,

724
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:17,955
- bob saget. - Nick: Really?

725
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,361
Mr. Robin thicke,

726
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:24,491
his first impression
was also bob saget.

727
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:26,846
- Wow.
- Robin: Yeah, but then, you know, the clues,

728
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,371
and you're wrong
so many times before

729
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:31,100
that you start
second-guessing yourself.

730
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:34,084
So I'm thinking of other
dads like ray romano

731
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:35,563
who are also stand-up comedians.

732
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:38,004
And then I went with
david squigglehoff

733
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:40,507
because of the teddy
bear and some other things.

734
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,550
But bob actually did this speech

735
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:44,177
at my father's rehearsal dinner

736
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:47,514
for his second wedding,
so bob and I go way back.

737
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:50,892
So it was the voice and the
sense of humor that gave it away.

738
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:53,228
I still think it's bob saget.

739
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:58,211
Ken, your first impression,
you said this is fabio.

740
00:37:58,235 --> 00:38:01,945
- Nicole: Oh, my gosh.
- You used that as a joke in previous seasons.

741
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:04,030
Oh, fabio's no joke, my friend.

742
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:07,158
- Nicole: Oh, my god.
- So are you sticking with this fabio guess?

743
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,202
- No, I'm not. - Smart move.

744
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:11,140
I've been going
back and forth on this.

745
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:13,540
I thought dr. Fauci
for medicine.

746
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:16,960
And al gore,
I thought for "inconvenient truth."

747
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:19,421
but this is my
inconvenient truth.

748
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:22,090
I'm changing my guess,
if that's okay with you.

749
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:25,010
When I'm thinking from
all the clue packages,

750
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,720
and actually today,

751
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:30,682
the teddy bear clue
was for ted mosby,

752
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:33,977
or "how I met your mother,"
that bob narrated.

753
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:36,855
I think it's bob saget.

754
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,149
At least you got to
somewhere sensible.

755
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:43,653
Nicole,
your first impression guess,

756
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:46,990
one of the ying yang twins.

757
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:53,038
Good night, nicole scherzinger.

758
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:58,084
- Nicole, I love it so much!
- Do you lose an ear for that?

759
00:38:58,128 --> 00:39:02,422
- I didn't know. I...
- this is my favorite guess ever on the show.

760
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:06,426
Wasn't it? And she didn't even make a
distinction between which ying yang twin.

761
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:10,555
Oh,
the one that got the hair like that.

762
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:13,016
Are you sticking with
your ying yang twins?

763
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,186
Of course I'm not.

764
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:21,649
I'm gonna have to
go with gary cole.

765
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:24,255
And that was "office
space." that was lumbergh,

766
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,883
- the character that you're doing an impression of.
- Thank you. Thanks. Yeah.

767
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:29,949
He was also the dad in
the movie "brady bunch."

768
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,452
- yes.
- Right? And also with the white house,

769
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:34,223
he was in "west wing" and "veep,"
so...

770
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:35,914
Pretty good guess.

771
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:39,000
Mr. Wayne brady,
who do you think this is?

772
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:42,587
Well, at first I thought it
was mystikal from no limit.

773
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:47,384
But, you know what? Everything
snapped into clear focus,

774
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,280
and I actually had
this guess myself

775
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,304
when I was writing
down stuff earlier.

776
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:56,142
I thought bob saget. What threw
me was all of the political stuff.

777
00:39:56,186 --> 00:40:00,105
But then the football with the guy getting
hit in the junk and the banana peel,

778
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,315
I went, "oh,
that's like a clip show."

779
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:05,026
well,
the gold standard for those clip shows

780
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:09,197
and for every host that's come after,
it's bob saget.

781
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:10,448
And if we are correct,

782
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:12,428
I'm sad that we're
sending bob saget home

783
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:14,138
because he truly is
one of the funniest,

784
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,932
dirtiest comedians of all time.

785
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:19,249
Indeed. I'm a huge
fan of bob saget.

786
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:22,335
Okay, panel,
you've made your final guesses.

787
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:25,004
Let's see if any
of you are right.

788
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:29,175
Squiggly monster,
show us who you really are.

789
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:30,427
Audience, say it with me.

790
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:34,097
( chanting ) take
it off! Take it off!

791
00:40:34,141 --> 00:40:37,954
- Take it off! Saget!
- <i>♪ who, who, who, who</i>

792
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:40,437
<i>♪ who are you?</i>

793
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,022

794
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:45,567
- <i>♪ who</i> - take it off, already!

795
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,236

796
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,072

798
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:59,539
- Saget!
- Nick: Television icon,

799
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:01,499
actor, entertainer,

800
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:04,377
comedian og, bob saget!

801
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:07,213
- Bob saget! - Ken: Saget!

802
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:10,800
Making so many people happy
as the squiggly monster, as you do.

803
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:12,719
We're so happy to have you here.

804
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:14,929
What you guys do here
is why I wanted to do this.

805
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:17,765
Because, you know,
we're all going through a tough time.

806
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:21,186
I get to be part of your
joy. And it's needed so bad.

807
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,980
They said,
"do you want to be squiggly monster?"

808
00:41:24,024 --> 00:41:27,984
they sent me a picture. I said,
"yeah."

809
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:31,215
ken's been texting me, "hey,
would you ever want to come by?"

810
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,198
and I went, "no,
I'm really... no.

811
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:34,969
I'm really busy. I love you."

812
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,993
and, nicole,
I don't know what to say.

813
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:40,413
- Nick: Miss ying ying twin.
- I bet you never felt more street, right?

814
00:41:40,457 --> 00:41:43,374
- Well, I am street. I am.
- Nick: He definitely is.

815
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:44,854
Ken: I know you won't
even remember this.

816
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:46,397
I was moonlighting
at the laugh factory,

817
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,463
going up and doing open mics,

818
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:51,966
and you actually saw my act,
like, 20 years ago.

819
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,552
- And you were so supportive.
- You can tell when someone

820
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:56,012
is special and someone is funny

821
00:41:56,056 --> 00:41:58,765
and someone is a
comedian at heart.

822
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:01,204
And not only that, but you were a
doctor and you gave me your free exam,

823
00:42:01,228 --> 00:42:03,247
- and I want to thank you.
- Right there in the club.

824
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:05,855
Right behind that red curtain.

825
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:08,483
What is the best part
about being squiggly monster?

826
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:12,173
- Taking it off.
- Great job.

827
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:15,073
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it one more time

828
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:17,992
for the icon
who is mr. Bob saget.

829
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:20,348
- We love you, bob.
- Love you, bob.

830
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:22,872

00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:39,013

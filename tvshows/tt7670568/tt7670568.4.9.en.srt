sense. ‐ And then...

I mean, I might have a few.

106

Right, Barry? "You got it!"

161
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,590
Wait, wait, wait. Barry? Barry?

162
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,935
Barry, yeah. It's the second
guest judge. It's Barry the Turkey.

163
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,394
"Hey!"

164
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,029
Barry the Turkey.

165
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,673
Are you gonna have
that on the entire show?

166
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:11,865
It's up to Barry. Barry?

167
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,701
"Yeah."

168
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,370
Has the show gotten
weirder since I left?

169
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,681
‐ Only when Ken
talks. ‐ Only Ken.

170
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,373
"Hey!"

171
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,875
Getting weirder and weirder.

172
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,643
All right, well,
let's get to it.

173
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,614
We're kicking things
off with the Jellyfish.

174
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:30,917
And since Thanksgiving is
a time for friends and family,

175
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:34,754
we've asked Jellyfish to invite
a person she's thankful for

176
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,557
- ‐ to give us some
new clues. - Ah.

177
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,805
<i>When I first
stepped out on the stage,</i>

178
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,397
<i>I was so nervous.</i>

179
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,467
<i>But now I feel like I
finally found my sea legs.</i>

180
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,903
Between you and me,
getting this far feels like a dream,

181
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,806
<i>because,
I'm a "Masked Singer" superfan.</i>

182
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:57,410
Just ask my sister, who when she's not
crunching numbers, loves watching with me.

183
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:01,715
Well, Jellyfish has always been
the rebel of our by the book family.

184
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:04,017
In reality,
she's also the overachiever.

185
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:06,853
I'm getting major
reality TV vibes.

186
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,789
Even though she's ticked off so
many accomplishments already,

187
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,926
she's always eager to
challenge herself in new arenas.

188
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:16,262
The nail file could mean that
she's got a beauty product line.

189
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,766
<i>We love singing along
together with our favorite show,</i>

190
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,369
<i>so I'm no stranger
to her gorgeous voice.</i>

191
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:25,038
And with her work ethic,
it's no surprise she's come this far.

192
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,540
Xs and Os again.

193
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,943
Good luck, Jelly. By my count,

194
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,612
you've got a great
shot at the super six.

195
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,814
You're number one.

196
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:38,284
I'm so excited. She is one
of my absolute favorites.

197
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,919
So good! She's so good!

198
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,889
Okay, all right.

199

<i>And later...</i>

205
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,803
The singer going home is...

206
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,605
Take it off!

207
00:08:58,671 --> 00:08:59,672
This one is killing me!

208
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,342

You got Jay Pharoah

Yeah, I didn't know that was
gonna come out of that Jellyfish.

240
00:11:04,396 --> 00:11:06,131
Yep, absolutely.

241
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,667
You really have
come so far already

242
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:10,969
after three performances.

243
00:11:11,036 --> 00:11:13,672
Honestly,
I think you've got a real shot

244
00:11:13,738 --> 00:11:17,609
at competing with Sun, Popcorn,
Seahorse in the super six.

245
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,677
I really do.

246
00:11:18,743 --> 00:11:21,413
‐ Wow. ‐ Yeah, sis.

247
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:26,017
All right, tonight is all about friends,
family, and giving thanks,

248
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:29,254
so we've asked each
character to bring a turkey,

249
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:32,991
along with a genuinely
game‐changing clue.

250
00:11:33,058 --> 00:11:36,428
Men In Black,
bring out Jellyfish's turkey.

251
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:43,768
All right. That's a real turkey.

252
00:11:43,835 --> 00:11:47,439
Wow. ‐ With a
message in a bottle. Got it.

253
00:11:47,505 --> 00:11:53,178
All right. Go ahead and read
your clue for 'em, Jellyfish.

254
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:56,314
If you find this,
you'll know I've never

255
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:59,517
performed on a stage
quite like this before.

256
00:11:59,584 --> 00:12:01,286
Ah. Wow.

257
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:02,763
Picking up on anything, Nicole?

258
00:12:02,787 --> 00:12:05,390
Well,
it's interesting because that could mean

259
00:12:05,457 --> 00:12:09,060
she's never been on a stage
like a voice competition stage.

260
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:12,731
‐ Ah. ‐ I think this could
possibly be Charli XCX.

261
00:12:12,797 --> 00:12:15,066
I mean,
we saw the Xs and the Os.

262
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:16,468
That's good.

263
00:12:16,534 --> 00:12:19,070
There was a gold stapler.
She has gold records.

264
00:12:19,137 --> 00:12:21,473
Everything just
feels very Charli XCX,

265
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:24,175
even the Coachella and the glow,
you know?

266
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:26,611
‐ Right, right. ‐ Yeah,
that's a good guess.

267
00:12:26,678 --> 00:12:28,647
But, you said, "in reality,"

268
00:12:28,713 --> 00:12:32,684
so I'm thinking that this
might be a reality TV star.

269
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,152
‐ Yeah. ‐ The calculator.

270
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:36,121
Somebody might have
been on the "Forbes" cover

271
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:37,756
as the youngest
billionaire ever.

272
00:12:37,822 --> 00:12:40,759
Ah.

273
00:12:40,825 --> 00:12:44,095
And the word
"dream" in those clues.

274
00:12:44,162 --> 00:12:46,264
Isn't that the name of Rob
Kardashian's daughter?

275
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:48,767
It's possibly Kylie Jenner.

276
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,169
That's a good guess right there.

277
00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:52,771
- I like it. - Yes.

278
00:12:52,837 --> 00:12:56,041
I was seeing some things
connected to Kylie, too.

279
00:12:56,107 --> 00:13:00,111
But I'm getting stuck on this gold medal,
gold staple,

280
00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:02,714
the body type. I just
feel like it's an athlete.

281
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,592
And the yoga mat,
it feels like maybe the father

282
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:07,285
was an athlete also,
or at least trained her.

283
00:13:07,352 --> 00:13:10,422
‐ Kylie's dad. ‐ Oh!

284
00:13:10,488 --> 00:13:14,426
Yeah, yeah. Okay, Kylie Jenner.

285
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:16,561
I mean, that's just where I went,
I mean...

286
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:18,463
I'm also still thinking athlete.

287
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:22,434
The baby powder clue.
Gymnasts use that powder.

288
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,302
And that Oscar moment clue?

289
00:13:24,369 --> 00:13:27,572
I think that gold medal
was your Oscar moment.

290
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:29,474
So I'm gonna go with
McKayla Maroney.

291
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,276
Yeah, all right.

292
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,578
- ‐ Good guess, Jenny. - Yes.

293
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:35,280
Honestly, whoever you are,

294
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,515
you are such a naturally
gifted little talent,

295
00:13:37,582 --> 00:13:40,085
- ‐ I'm just‐‐ I'm so happy. Great job,
girl. - Way to go!

296
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:42,487
Setting it off,
y'all give it up for the Jellyfish!

297
00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:47,325
<i>Was the Jellyfish's performance
enough to secure her</i>

298
00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:49,094

six and competing against

302
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:58,603
some of the most amazing
singers I've ever heard.

303
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:02,374

stay out of the smackdown.

00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,450
We do all the fixings,

Uh, he would say, listen...

00:14:27,298 --> 00:14:29,010
Me and Troy Williams are the same height,
damn it.

315
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,302
It don't make no sense.

316
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:34,973
<i>♪ Who is that?</i>

317
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,509
Welcome back to a show that's all pleasure,
no guilt.

318
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:39,978
It's "The Masked Singer."

319
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:43,982
Next up, it's our favorite "fun guy,"
the Mushroom.

320
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,684
<i>Here's some new clues about
this tremendous toadstool.</i>

321
00:14:51,322 --> 00:14:54,759
<i>I've had a blast
throwing the panel off my scent.</i>

322
00:14:54,826 --> 00:14:58,663
I thought you are a woman,
but I think you're a man underneath there.

323
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,499
I'm so grateful to have this
kind of fun onstage again.

324
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:04,035
<i>And with the super
six on the line,</i>

325
00:15:04,102 --> 00:15:07,439
<i>I'm even more determined to
keep the panel on their toes.</i>

326
00:15:07,505 --> 00:15:09,574
<i>There's only one friend on
Earth who knows I'm here.</i>

327
00:15:09,641 --> 00:15:11,943
He's a real life
government agent.

328
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:17,282
No comment.

329
00:15:19,684 --> 00:15:23,588
Off the record,
Mushroom has always been a go‐getter.

330
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:26,057
In high school,
Mushroom was class president

331
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:28,293
<i>with a GPA over 4.0.</i>

332
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:30,228
<i>When Mushy's mind
is set on something,</i>

333
00:15:30,295 --> 00:15:32,063
<i>Mushy goes after it hardcore.</i>

334
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,465
‐ K. I. T. ‐ Keep in touch.

335
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:35,333
Could mean something else,
though.

336
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,735
<i>Whether it's helping
under‐privileged youth</i>

337
00:15:37,802 --> 00:15:40,071
<i>or making phone calls
for important causes...</i>

338
00:15:40,138 --> 00:15:41,573
A bull. Maybe from Chicago.

339
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:42,874
Oh, that's true.

340
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:44,742
<i>...Mushroom's work
ethic is unrivaled,</i>

341
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:46,369
<i>and you're seeing
it here on that stage.</i>

342
00:15:46,411 --> 00:15:48,246
A wresting or boxing ring?

343
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:51,082
Good luck, Mushroom.

344
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:52,617
Your secrets are
always safe with me.

345
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:54,752

‐ Wow. ‐ This one is killing me,
Ken.

374
00:17:46,297 --> 00:17:49,334
Another stellar performance.

375
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,236
Changing it up
every single week.

376

They're all fizzed
out right now.

380
00:17:58,676 --> 00:18:02,513
‐ Right? ‐ This one is
frustrating me the most!

381
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,118
Every performance that Mushroom does,
for me, is transcending.

382
00:18:07,185 --> 00:18:10,188
I don't know who you are yet,
but you possess a power

383
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:14,192
underneath that
Mario Bros. costume.

384
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,426
Totally.

385
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:17,262
Based on your talent,
I have no doubt

386
00:18:17,328 --> 00:18:18,405
you're going to the super six.

387
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:20,431
‐ Absolutely, Jenny. ‐ Right?

388
00:18:20,498 --> 00:18:23,701
All right, well,
let's see what we can gather

389
00:18:23,768 --> 00:18:25,303
from Mushroom's
game‐changing clue.

390
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,705
Men In Black,
bring out the bird.

391
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:30,975
I mean...

392
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:32,186
I mean,
what do turkey‐‐ gobble gobble.

393
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,611
‐ There we go. ‐ Gobble. Gobble.

394
00:18:33,678 --> 00:18:35,758
‐ They gobble. ‐ Gobble,
gobble, gobble. There we go.

395
00:18:37,482 --> 00:18:39,584
Okay.

396
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:44,155
"Do not open, especially on TV."

397
00:18:44,222 --> 00:18:46,557
All right, what's in your clue,
Mushroom?

398
00:18:46,624 --> 00:18:51,396
The name that I go by now

399
00:18:51,462 --> 00:18:55,500
was not my name
when I first sprouted.

400
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:58,002
Oh!

401
00:18:58,069 --> 00:19:00,738
‐ That's a good clue. ‐
Robin: That's a good clue.

402
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:03,408
But there are so many artists
that have changed their names.

403
00:19:03,474 --> 00:19:07,945
‐ Yeah. ‐ Well,
there's a young artist‐entrepreneur

404
00:19:08,012 --> 00:19:10,448
who's in the 4.0
grade point average,

405
00:19:10,515 --> 00:19:13,551
and also he just recently
changed his name

406
00:19:13,618 --> 00:19:16,087
from Jaden Smith to Jaden.

407
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:18,556
So I still think it
might be Jaden Smith.

408
00:19:18,623 --> 00:19:20,692
Huh.

409
00:19:20,758 --> 00:19:22,336
And he's an advocate
for having clean water

410
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,362
for Flint,
Michigan and everything,

411
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,597
so he's definitely
into the environment.

412
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:29,300
But my son is so multi‐talented

413
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:33,604
that Jaden is, like,
50 million light years

414
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:35,606
ahead of everybody.

415
00:19:35,673 --> 00:19:39,477
You know what I'm saying? So...

416
00:19:39,544 --> 00:19:41,045
Check it out.

417
00:19:41,112 --> 00:19:42,380
Wow.

418
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:45,717
Good guess. But
I'm going out on a limb,

419
00:19:45,783 --> 00:19:47,952
and my best clue's
always my ear.

420
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:50,221
I'm thinking this
could be Taye Diggs?

421
00:19:50,288 --> 00:19:54,092
‐ Taye Diggs can sing. ‐
Taye is a Broadway star.

422
00:19:54,158 --> 00:19:56,327
There's a lot of Broadway clues.

423
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:59,630
Also this week there was a bull,
made me think of Chicago,

424
00:19:59,697 --> 00:20:01,966
and Taye Diggs starred
in the musical "Chicago."

425
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:04,235
I like it. I like
it. ‐ That's not a bad one.

426
00:20:04,302 --> 00:20:05,779
That's a great guess,
but completely wrong.

427
00:20:05,803 --> 00:20:08,172
‐ Ooh, shots fired. ‐ Ken.

428
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:12,643
I think the word "secrets"
for his song "Secrets."

429
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,646
There is a red folder. Another hit song,
"Red Eye."

430
00:20:15,713 --> 00:20:18,649
Maybe this could be The Weeknd.

431
00:20:18,716 --> 00:20:20,284
Just maybe. Hear me out.

432
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,551
Abel. Abel.

433
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:23,254
‐ What? ‐ Abel.

434
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:24,455
No, I said The Weeknd.

435
00:20:24,522 --> 00:20:26,424
No,
his name‐‐ the person's name is Abel.

436
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:29,427
‐ The project is
The Weeknd. ‐ Abel.

437
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,529
So, technically, Ken,
he did change his name.

438
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:35,433
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

439
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,437
Well, whoever you are,
you truly believe in who you are.

440
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,544
- ‐ You're confident in who
you are. - Totally.

441
00:20:41,572 --> 00:20:44,275
I sure hope we get to see you
go up against Sun and Popcorn.

442
00:20:44,342 --> 00:20:45,510
Yep. Absolutely.

443
00:20:45,576 --> 00:20:47,278
Right. The Mushroom
came to play,

444
00:20:47,345 --> 00:20:49,480
so keep it going one more time

445
00:20:49,547 --> 00:20:53,184
for the Mushroom,
ladies and gentlemen.

446
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:56,621
<i>Did Mushroom sing
his way into the super six?</i>

<i>Tell us what you think.</i>

448
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:03,327
Switching things up has
been my strategy from the start.

449
00:21:03,394 --> 00:21:04,962
And I definitely
think it's working,

450
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:07,331
because the panel
is totally tripping.

451
00:21:07,398 --> 00:21:10,468
Oh, my gosh,
this is driving me crazy.

452
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:13,137
His voice is
different every week.

453
00:21:13,204 --> 00:21:15,306
I know! It's so hard.

454
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:18,543

00:22:05,035 --> 00:22:06,737
from these two special ladies

472
00:22:06,804 --> 00:22:09,039
that's truly been the
secret to my success.

473
00:22:09,106 --> 00:22:13,143
Broccoli is truly the
ringmaster of our lives.

474
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,946
He's always been
the greatest showman.

475
00:22:16,013 --> 00:22:19,883
He's larger than life. He
lives to light up a room.

476
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,585
Jason mask. Jason Alexander.

477
00:22:21,652 --> 00:22:22,686
Yeah, you right.

478
00:22:22,753 --> 00:22:25,556
And his showbiz
stories are legendary.

479
00:22:25,622 --> 00:22:28,959
As a kid,
he used to sneak into the local circus

480
00:22:29,026 --> 00:22:30,761
<i>and cut holes into the curtain</i>

481
00:22:30,828 --> 00:22:32,563
<i>so he could watch the show,</i>

482
00:22:32,629 --> 00:22:34,898
<i>dreaming about being
one of the performers.</i>

483
00:22:34,965 --> 00:22:37,735
‐ Until he got caught! ‐

484
00:22:37,801 --> 00:22:39,636
<i>But that's our Broccoli.</i>

485
00:22:39,703 --> 00:22:41,972
<i>He's scrappy. He's got chutzpah.</i>

486
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:44,908
Wow,
maybe he did something with the Beatles.

487
00:22:44,975 --> 00:22:47,177
The other contestants
better watch out.

488
00:22:47,244 --> 00:22:48,645
He approaches everything

489
00:22:48,712 --> 00:22:52,516
with unparalleled
perfectionism and pizzazz.

490
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:54,585
Dice. More Vegas vibes.

491
00:22:54,651 --> 00:22:56,653
So knock 'em dead tonight,
Broccoli.

492
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,022
We love you.

Come on!

519
00:24:36,053 --> 00:24:39,456
Broc star! Broc and roll,
right there.

520
00:24:39,523 --> 00:24:42,159
My God. Nicole,
you still on your feet.

521
00:24:42,226 --> 00:24:46,997
Nick,
Broccoli rocked out with his Broc out, yo!

522
00:24:48,632 --> 00:24:49,676
He was dropping
it like it was hot.

523
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,835
He was going low.

524
00:24:51,902 --> 00:24:54,771
Whoo! ‐ Like,
you killed it. Thank you.

525
00:24:54,838 --> 00:24:58,809
‐ Yes, whoo! ‐ All right,
Broccoli, it's Thanksgiving time.

526
00:24:58,876 --> 00:25:01,145
So, Men In Black,
bring out the turkey.

527
00:25:01,211 --> 00:25:03,747
Gobble, gobble.

528
00:25:05,782 --> 00:25:07,551
Bring us them clues.

529
00:25:07,618 --> 00:25:10,954
‐ I'm thankful for the clues. ‐ Okay,
we have a recipe card.

530
00:25:11,021 --> 00:25:15,859
‐ Oh. ‐ Broccoli,
what's your game‐changing clue?

531
00:25:15,926 --> 00:25:21,431
Do not put your broccoli
in the microwave.

532
00:25:21,498 --> 00:25:26,203
‐ Ooh. ‐ Which was
invented after I was born.

533
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,572
‐ Ooh. ‐ Okay, so he is older.

534
00:25:28,639 --> 00:25:31,041
‐ What? ‐ So,
what's that? The '70s?

535
00:25:31,108 --> 00:25:36,113
‐ Or was it '70s or '80s? ‐
Microwave was invented 2010.

536
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,749
- ‐ It was invented in
the forties. - Oh!

537
00:25:38,815 --> 00:25:40,584
Uh‐oh. There's that clue expert.

538
00:25:40,651 --> 00:25:42,219
So he's over 70 years old.

539
00:25:42,286 --> 00:25:43,820
‐ Oh! ‐ You got something, Jay?

540
00:25:43,887 --> 00:25:45,722
Well, I'ma say this.

541
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:47,891
One of the clues said
"ringmaster of our lives,"

542
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:49,726
he tells us the
weather every morning.

543
00:25:49,793 --> 00:25:51,728
Lenny Kravitz is
his second cousin,

544
00:25:51,795 --> 00:25:53,163
so music is in his blood.

545
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:56,800
- ‐ I was thinking Al
Roker. - Yeah.

546
00:25:56,867 --> 00:25:59,002
Was Al Roker born
before the microwave?

547
00:25:59,069 --> 00:26:02,673
He's been here for a long,
long time.

548
00:26:02,739 --> 00:26:08,178
‐ Dr. Ken? ‐ I know
exactly who this is.

549
00:26:08,245 --> 00:26:09,822
Uh‐oh. We haven't got
a lot of those this season.

550
00:26:09,846 --> 00:26:12,583
- I - almost forgot about them.

551
00:26:12,649 --> 00:26:14,685
I'm so proud of you.
The therapy's working.

552
00:26:14,751 --> 00:26:18,789
Here's the dealio. There were
five beetles in the package.

553
00:26:18,855 --> 00:26:23,193
There can only be one Beatle
here tonight‐‐ Ringo Starr.

554
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:27,030
That is it. You are a star. Stop laughing,
Robin.

555
00:26:27,097 --> 00:26:30,200
‐ Ringmaster, AKA, Ringo. ‐ Ooh.

556
00:26:30,267 --> 00:26:33,203
Jason mask. His
son is named Jason.

557
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:36,707
I won again.

558
00:26:36,773 --> 00:26:39,109
Ringo Starr. Boom.

559
00:26:39,176 --> 00:26:41,111
That's actually really good.

560
00:26:41,178 --> 00:26:42,989
You know what? In the
last clue package, remember,

561
00:26:43,013 --> 00:26:45,191
there was something about
the numbers spelled out "Frank."

562
00:26:45,215 --> 00:26:49,219
‐ Oh! ‐ Well,
this person wrote the classic song "My Way"

563
00:26:49,286 --> 00:26:50,887
‐ for Frank Sinatra. ‐ Mm‐hmm.

564
00:26:50,954 --> 00:26:53,824
And then I saw
there was a moose.

565
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:56,226
So, he's a fellow "Canadian!"
as my father would say.

566
00:26:56,293 --> 00:26:59,763
"Canadian!" From the
voice and the knees,

567
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,632
I know this person
to be very fit,

568
00:27:01,698 --> 00:27:02,766
a wonderful human being.

569
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:05,702
- ‐ I think it's Paul
Anka. - Oh!

570
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:07,237
‐ All right. ‐ Ah.

571
00:27:07,304 --> 00:27:10,774
‐ Good guess. ‐ Now,
Broccoli, before we let you go,

572
00:27:10,841 --> 00:27:12,776
one fan online wants to know

573
00:27:12,843 --> 00:27:15,545
what's your favorite
Thanksgiving dish?

574
00:27:15,612 --> 00:27:16,847
Turkey, of course.

575
00:27:16,913 --> 00:27:18,915
I like candied yams.

576
00:27:18,982 --> 00:27:20,851
Mmm, with the marshmallows.

577
00:27:20,917 --> 00:27:24,788
And a 42‐year‐old in Chicago.

578
00:27:24,855 --> 00:27:28,859
Oh, my gosh! Is this my dad?

579
00:27:28,925 --> 00:27:31,928
He dances just like
him. I'm a little scared.

580
00:27:31,995 --> 00:27:33,530
One thing we do know,

581
00:27:33,597 --> 00:27:35,032
it was an outstanding
performance.

582
00:27:35,098 --> 00:27:37,534
Give it up one more
time for the Broccoli.

583
00:27:37,601 --> 00:27:39,469
Yeah! Whoo!

584
00:27:39,536 --> 00:27:42,039
<i>Did the Broccoli
roast the competition enough</i>

585
00:27:42,105 --> 00:27:44,474
<i>to sauté a spot
in the super six?</i>

586
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:47,210
<i>Tell us what you think.</i>

587
00:27:47,277 --> 00:27:50,447
It has been an evening
of fierce competition,

588
00:27:50,514 --> 00:27:55,085
but now it's time for the audience,
panel, and our superfans

589
00:27:55,152 --> 00:27:57,220
to vote for their
favorite of the night.

590
00:27:57,287 --> 00:28:00,557
The two singers with
the least amount of votes

591
00:28:00,624 --> 00:28:04,895
will battle it out in our
"Masked Singer" smackdown.

592
00:28:04,961 --> 00:28:06,697
The votes are in.

593
00:28:06,763 --> 00:28:09,700
The singer with the most votes

594
00:28:09,766 --> 00:28:11,668
going straight to
the super six is...

595
00:28:11,735 --> 00:28:13,437
Oh, it's happening.

596
00:28:21,778 --> 00:28:24,781
‐ Jellyfish! ‐ Jenny: Oh,

597
00:28:24,848 --> 00:28:28,852
‐ Wow. ‐ Oh!

598
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:31,688
Congratulations!

599
00:28:31,755 --> 00:28:35,559
Jellyfish, you have officially
made it into next week's super six.

600
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:40,797
‐ I can't believe it. ‐ That means
the smackdown for the final spot

601
00:28:40,864 --> 00:28:43,533
in the super six is going to be

602
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,802
between Mushroom and Broccoli.

603
00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:49,439

‐ Whoo! ‐ Before the break,

615
00:29:20,103 --> 00:29:22,873
Jellyfish secured a
spot in the super six.

616
00:29:23,491 --> 00:29:25,293
There's only one spot left,

617
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,262
and it all comes
down to this moment.

618
00:29:27,329 --> 00:29:31,599
Broccoli and Mushroom
will have one last chance

619
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:35,570
to battle it out in
the smackdown!

620
00:29:35,637 --> 00:29:39,007
‐ Yeah! ‐

621
00:29:39,074 --> 00:29:43,178
It's time to smackdown!

622
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,749
‐ Yeah! ‐ Yes! Yes!

623
00:29:47,816 --> 00:29:50,752
‐ Let's go! ‐ In this mouth,

624
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:53,488
weighing in at nine ounces,

625
00:29:53,555 --> 00:29:59,127

it's dipped in cheddar cheese sauce,

00:29:59,194 --> 00:30:01,529
it's the Broccoli!

627
00:30:02,564 --> 00:30:06,601
‐ Whoo! ‐ Whoo!

628
00:30:06,668 --> 00:30:09,704
Brocco!

629
00:30:09,771 --> 00:30:14,309
And in this mouth,
they can be psychedelic,

630
00:30:14,376 --> 00:30:17,479
a pizza topping, or found in
Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory.

631
00:30:17,545 --> 00:30:20,548
‐ Get it! ‐ It's the Mushroom.

632
00:30:22,851 --> 00:30:26,621
‐ Mushroom! ‐ Whoo!

633
00:30:26,688 --> 00:30:28,757
Yeah.

634
00:30:31,526 --> 00:30:34,129
Okay, you two know the rules.

635
00:30:34,195 --> 00:30:35,497
You're gonna sing,

636
00:30:35,563 --> 00:30:37,499
‐ our panel's gonna vote... ‐ Aw,
snap.

637
00:30:37,565 --> 00:30:40,201
One of you will move
on to the super six,

638
00:30:40,268 --> 00:30:42,637
- ‐ and the other will
take it off. - Man!

639
00:30:42,704 --> 00:30:45,240
Broccoli, you are up first.

640
00:30:45,306 --> 00:30:50,145
‐ It's time to
smackdown. ‐ Yeah!

641
00:30:50,211 --> 00:30:52,814
Oh, man. This looks like
the salad bar at Gelson's.

One of my favorite songs
of all time right there.

684
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,296
That was so much fun to watch,
I must say.

685
00:33:21,362 --> 00:33:25,200
Yeah! Jay,
what did you think about our smackdown?

686
00:33:25,266 --> 00:33:26,601
Let me say it like this.

687
00:33:26,668 --> 00:33:28,036
Well, the Rock believes

688
00:33:28,102 --> 00:33:30,171
the Broccoli,
you did your thing.

689
00:33:30,238 --> 00:33:32,273
You were killing it. Mushroom.

690
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,775
I don't know, Mushroom.

691
00:33:33,841 --> 00:33:35,419
You got a little
truffle butter in there.

692
00:33:35,443 --> 00:33:37,779
It's amazing.

693
00:33:37,845 --> 00:33:40,181
That's what it is.

694
00:33:40,248 --> 00:33:43,051
‐ So good! ‐ Nicole: Come on,
Jay.

695
00:33:43,117 --> 00:33:44,361
I thought it was unbelievable.

696
00:33:44,385 --> 00:33:45,396
Just to watch it visually,

697
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,788
it was like veggie
on veggie crime.

698
00:33:46,854 --> 00:33:49,057
I was like, what is happening?

699
00:33:49,123 --> 00:33:50,458
And I loved it because,
Broccoli,

700
00:33:50,525 --> 00:33:52,293
you don't want to go home,
do you?

701
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,362
You want to keep going.
You were there for it.

702
00:33:54,429 --> 00:33:56,464
I felt it, the passion.

703
00:33:56,531 --> 00:33:58,199
And Mushroom was like, "Unh‐uh.

704
00:33:58,266 --> 00:34:01,803
I'm going to be chopping
broccoli‐lay‐hay right now."

705
00:34:01,869 --> 00:34:05,073
He came out here
singing to take me down,

706
00:34:05,139 --> 00:34:07,342
‐ so I took him down! ‐ Whoo!

707
00:34:07,408 --> 00:34:09,477
Oh, my gosh! Oh!

708
00:34:09,544 --> 00:34:14,249
Go for it, babe, 'cause I don't know
when you'll be in this garden again.

709
00:34:14,315 --> 00:34:17,252
Oh,
my God! This is the best smackdown!

710
00:34:17,318 --> 00:34:20,755
That was real smack talk
right there. ‐ This is getting heated.

711
00:34:20,822 --> 00:34:23,258
Panel, it is time to vote

712
00:34:23,324 --> 00:34:26,494
for who you believe
won that smackdown.

713
00:34:26,561 --> 00:34:27,762
Get to it.

714
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:31,633
‐ Oh,
this is hard. ‐ This is tough.

715
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:34,168
‐ 'Cause they're both
entertaining. ‐ Totally.

716
00:34:38,573 --> 00:34:43,144
Broccoli, Mushroom,
the votes have been tallied.

717
00:34:43,211 --> 00:34:46,514
And the singer going home is...

718
00:34:57,558 --> 00:35:00,795
The winner who
gets to keep it on

719
00:35:00,862 --> 00:35:05,700
and grab the final
spot in the super six is...

720
00:35:08,803 --> 00:35:12,140
No! I don't like this
part. It's Thanksgiving.

721
00:35:15,209 --> 00:35:18,746
‐ Mushroom! ‐ Jenny and Nicole: Oh,
Mushroom!

722
00:35:18,813 --> 00:35:20,682
Mushroom, congratulations.

723
00:35:20,748 --> 00:35:25,086
You have officially
made it to the super six.

724
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:27,322
‐ Way to go,
'Shroom! ‐ Happy Thanksgiving.

725
00:35:27,388 --> 00:35:31,693
Show some distanced love
to your fellow food product.

726
00:35:31,759 --> 00:35:35,496
‐ Yes! ‐ Broccoli,
come on down here.

727
00:35:35,563 --> 00:35:40,101
We are so,
so sorry to see you go, man.

728
00:35:40,168 --> 00:35:41,602
Definitely one of my favorites,

729
00:35:41,669 --> 00:35:44,439
but the good news
is we all can't wait

730
00:35:44,505 --> 00:35:47,608
‐ to find out who
you are. ‐ Brocco!

731
00:35:47,675 --> 00:35:52,046
But first, let's retrieve the
panel's first impression guesses

732
00:35:52,113 --> 00:35:55,516
‐ from the vault. ‐ Oh, no.

733
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:58,453
Men In Black,
bring 'em out, bring 'em out!

734
00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:04,225
It was so long ago,
I have no idea what I put.

735
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:07,128
Well, I'm about to tell you.
We're gonna start with Nicole.

736
00:36:07,195 --> 00:36:09,630
‐ Oh, great. Thanks,
Nick. ‐ Wow.

737
00:36:09,697 --> 00:36:13,301
Nichole's first impression
guess was Bill Murray.

738
00:36:13,368 --> 00:36:15,636
‐ Oh, that's good. That's
not embarrassing. ‐ Yeah.

739
00:36:15,703 --> 00:36:19,574
‐ That's good. ‐ Are you gonna
stick with that, Sherlock Scherzie?

740
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,342
I am not gonna stick with it

741
00:36:21,409 --> 00:36:24,645
because I saw the roulette,
thought of Vegas.

742
00:36:24,712 --> 00:36:27,348
We know this
person as Mr. Vegas.

743
00:36:27,415 --> 00:36:30,251
Guys, get me the ranch dressing

744
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:33,421
'cause Broccoli is Wayne Newton.

745
00:36:33,488 --> 00:36:35,256
Yeah! ‐ All right.

746
00:36:35,323 --> 00:36:37,024
Good guess. ‐ Thank you.

747
00:36:37,091 --> 00:36:38,292
‐ All right, Ken. ‐ No.

748
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:41,329
Your first impression guess,
Martin Short.

749
00:36:41,396 --> 00:36:43,765
‐ We know you love him. ‐ That's good,
Ken.

750
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:47,769
Thank you. But honestly,
now I'm thinking this is Ringo Starr.

751
00:36:47,835 --> 00:36:51,105
You heard "ringmaster"
in the clue package. Ringo.

752
00:36:51,172 --> 00:36:54,308
Jason mask. His
son is named Jason.

753
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:57,278
- ‐ This is Ringo Starr. - Okay.

754
00:36:57,345 --> 00:36:58,822
- That's not bad.
- Robin Thicke,

755
00:36:58,846 --> 00:37:02,116
your first impression
guess was Bob Newhart.

756
00:37:02,183 --> 00:37:03,384
Yeah.

757
00:37:03,451 --> 00:37:06,053
‐ That's not bad. ‐ Are
you sticking with that?

758
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,123
No, I'm not sticking with that.
There's too much Canada!

759
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:11,325
‐ "Canadian!" ‐ Canadian.

760
00:37:11,392 --> 00:37:13,961
There was the "Foodfellas"
from the previous package.

761
00:37:14,028 --> 00:37:15,372
‐ "Goodfellas,"
yeah. ‐ They were doing "Goodfellas."

762
00:37:15,396 --> 00:37:16,330
He was riding in
the back of the car.

763
00:37:16,397 --> 00:37:17,665
He goes to see the big cheese.

764
00:37:17,732 --> 00:37:20,468
‐ The big cheese was
Frank Sinatra. ‐ Wow.

765
00:37:20,535 --> 00:37:23,004
That night, he wrote "My Way."

766
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,673
I think it is the
legendary Mr. Paul Anka.

767
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:29,744
Yes. ‐ Wow. Robin
sounds very for sure of that.

768
00:37:29,811 --> 00:37:31,312
‐ Wow. ‐ Jenny.

769
00:37:31,379 --> 00:37:34,749
‐ Yeah,
Nick? ‐ You said Jerry Springer.

770
00:37:34,816 --> 00:37:37,618
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

771
00:37:37,685 --> 00:37:40,521
- Jerry Springer! - Jerry!

772
00:37:40,588 --> 00:37:43,491
‐ So you sticking with it? ‐ I
don't think I'm gonna stick with it.

773
00:37:43,558 --> 00:37:45,626
Based on the clues
that we saw this week,

774
00:37:45,693 --> 00:37:49,030
I felt like who is
connected with the Beatles?

775
00:37:49,096 --> 00:37:50,598
And then I realized Neil Sedaka,

776
00:37:50,665 --> 00:37:52,600
he was best friends
with John Lennon.

777
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:55,369
‐ Ah! I love that.
‐ I know! Right?

778
00:37:55,436 --> 00:37:58,306
- ‐ So I'm going with Neil Sedaka.
- That's a good guess.

779
00:37:58,372 --> 00:38:00,708
Cluemaster. ‐
That's a pretty good one.

780
00:38:00,775 --> 00:38:04,545
And, Mr. Jay Pharoah,
who is this Broc star?

781
00:38:04,612 --> 00:38:07,381
At first,
I thought it was Al Roker.

782
00:38:07,448 --> 00:38:09,984
But my black meter didn't
go off when you were singing.

783
00:38:10,051 --> 00:38:14,055
So,
after listening to your voice,

784
00:38:14,121 --> 00:38:17,225
I'm gonna say
that it's Paul Simon.

785
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:18,726
Ah! ‐ Final answer.

786
00:38:18,793 --> 00:38:23,297
And Paul Simon is definitely
older than a microwave.

787
00:38:24,532 --> 00:38:25,967
Just saying, baby, you know.

788
00:38:26,033 --> 00:38:29,570
Okay, panel,
you have made your final guesses.

789
00:38:29,637 --> 00:38:32,573
Let's see if any
of you are right.

790
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,577
Broccoli,
show us your famous face.

791
00:38:36,644 --> 00:38:38,412
Audience, say it with me.

792
00:38:38,479 --> 00:38:41,415
Take it off! Take it off!

793
00:38:41,482 --> 00:38:44,585
<i>♪ Who, who, who, who</i>

794
00:38:44,652 --> 00:38:48,089
‐ Come on,
Paul. ‐ <i>♪ Who are you?</i>

795
00:38:48,155 --> 00:38:49,457
<i>♪ Who, who, who, who</i>

796
00:38:49,524 --> 00:38:50,591
Take it off!

797
00:38:50,658 --> 00:38:52,493
<i>♪ Who?</i>

798
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,694
<i>♪ I really wanna know</i>

799
00:38:53,761 --> 00:38:56,430
‐ <i>♪ Who?</i> ‐ Take it off!

800
00:38:56,497 --> 00:38:59,300
<i>♪ Tell me who are you,
you, you? ♪</i>

801
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:00,668

802
00:39:02,169 --> 00:39:07,208
Legendary entertainer Paul Anka!

803
00:39:07,275 --> 00:39:11,212
‐ Oh, my God! ‐ Yeah!

804
00:39:11,279 --> 00:39:14,315
‐ You! You, you,
you! ‐ Canadian!

805
00:39:14,382 --> 00:39:17,318
‐ Yeah! "Canadian!" ‐
Robin Thicke got it right.

806
00:39:17,385 --> 00:39:19,587
‐ You got it! ‐ I was close.

807
00:39:19,654 --> 00:39:22,323
You're a legend. You've been on many,
many stages.

808
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:27,061
Tell us, what was it like
being on this stage as Broccoli?

809
00:39:27,128 --> 00:39:29,330
It was a great,
great kick, you know?

810
00:39:29,397 --> 00:39:32,166
These 65 years,
I've never been out of work.

811
00:39:32,233 --> 00:39:35,236
So I said, "You know what? I
gotta get on the boards again,

812
00:39:35,303 --> 00:39:36,671
and I'm gonna go
and have some fun,

813
00:39:36,737 --> 00:39:38,448
'cause I'm gonna come home
and enjoy it with the kids."

814
00:39:38,472 --> 00:39:42,009
And I gotta tell you something,
I'm very humbled

815
00:39:42,076 --> 00:39:44,278
because we have gone
through something in our country.

816
00:39:44,345 --> 00:39:47,748
And to have this kind of
fun and enjoy this like this,

817
00:39:47,815 --> 00:39:50,251
- ‐ you should all be very,
very proud, okay? - Oh!

818
00:39:50,318 --> 00:39:52,329
‐ That's beautiful. Beautifully said,
Paul. ‐ Well said.

819
00:39:52,353 --> 00:39:54,622
Well said, Paul!

820
00:39:54,689 --> 00:39:57,491
We hate to see you go home,
but it's perfect

821
00:39:57,558 --> 00:39:59,627
that you were unmasked
during Thanksgiving weekend.

822
00:39:59,694 --> 00:40:01,429
‐ Totally. ‐ Because we are so,

823
00:40:01,495 --> 00:40:02,806
so truly grateful to
have you. Thank you.

824
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,432
Yeah!

825
00:40:04,498 --> 00:40:07,635
And how about them
knees? My goodness.

826
00:40:07,702 --> 00:40:09,770
So good! ‐ He's still got it.

827
00:40:09,837 --> 00:40:12,373
Can I just ask how do you
keep in such good shape?

828
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,276
- ‐ Because you did moves that I
can't even do. - Exactly.

829
00:40:15,343 --> 00:40:19,113
You work with Sinatra and
Sammy and Dean from back then,

830
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,615
I got it all out of my system.

831
00:40:20,681 --> 00:40:23,651
So somewhere
in the midst of that,

832
00:40:23,718 --> 00:40:25,429
I said, "You know,
you better take care of yourself, man."

833
00:40:25,453 --> 00:40:28,789
And I've got five girls,
a 14‐year‐old son,

834
00:40:28,856 --> 00:40:31,292
and I got nine grandchildren,
so I gotta stay fit.

835
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,294
Wow.

836
00:40:33,361 --> 00:40:36,197
Now, Mr. Robin Thicke,
you were spot on.

837
00:40:36,263 --> 00:40:38,241
- ‐ It wasn't your first impression
guess. - No, no.

838
00:40:38,265 --> 00:40:39,734
It took me a couple of listens,

839
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,304
and then as my father pointed
out to me my whole life‐‐

840
00:40:43,371 --> 00:40:46,140
"Canadian." Anybody who's Canadian,
I know.

841
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:49,076
So as soon as Canadian
shows up in the clue package,

842
00:40:49,143 --> 00:40:50,854
‐ the wheels start
turning. ‐ That is hilarious.

843
00:40:50,878 --> 00:40:54,048
‐ "Canadian." ‐ "Canadian,
Robin."

844
00:40:54,115 --> 00:40:55,349
That's spot on. That's‐‐

845
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:57,652
"Paul Anka, he wrote 'My Way'.

846
00:40:57,718 --> 00:41:00,321
Big hit."

847
00:41:00,388 --> 00:41:03,491
This is an episode of great impressions,
indeed.

848
00:41:03,557 --> 00:41:06,460
‐ Amazing. ‐ But
no first impressions.

849
00:41:06,527 --> 00:41:08,763
The scores remain Jenny
in the lead with three points...

850
00:41:08,829 --> 00:41:11,365
‐ Yes! ‐ ...and Robin
and Nicole tied at two.

851
00:41:11,432 --> 00:41:13,467
I'm coming for that Golden Ear.

852
00:41:13,534 --> 00:41:15,603
There it is. Happy
Thanksgiving. ‐ Whoo!

853
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:20,107
Let's hear it one more time
for the legendary Paul Anka.

854
00:41:20,174 --> 00:41:22,677
Yeah! Paul Anka!

855
00:41:22,743 --> 00:41:24,478
Brocco!

856
00:41:24,545 --> 00:41:26,514
Thank you to my
brother Jay Pharoah.

857
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:29,450
‐ Jay, we love you! ‐ Coming through
with all that hilarious commentary.

858
00:41:29,517 --> 00:41:32,620
Happy Thanksgiving, America!

859
00:41:32,687 --> 00:41:36,791

860
00:41:36,857 --> 00:41:42,396

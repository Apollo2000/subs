1
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,520
Why don't you glue your head to the TV?
Don't let your food sit. Eat it.

2
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,640
Get me a cable box.
I'll record it and watch later.

3
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,560
-Did you apply for the computer classes?
-Yes.

4
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,280
What is the class called?

5
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,080
What is it?

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,800
Magi-tech.

7
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,080
-Mom!
-Look at me!

8
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,280
Start attending those classes or else
I will bash your head into the TV. Got it?

9
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,520
-Let it be.
-Why should I let it go?

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,040
Aren't we paying for it?

11
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,960
Give me the phone.

12
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,640
-It's Mr. Sartaj.
-Give it to me!

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,880
-Let me check...
-Practice what you preach.

14
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,720
Got it?

15
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,040
Got it.

16
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,400
Yes.

17
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,160
-Why the fuck are you breaking it?
-Shut up, motherfucker.

18
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,520
Your sister is waiting for me.

19
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,680
You bitch...

20
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,840
Stupid bitch!

21
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,720
It's dominated by Marathi-speaking people.

22
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,640
Sir, how will I get Muslim votes?

23
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,840
He's a Muslim.

24
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,560
He doesn't give a fuck about the election.

25
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,080
He'll help you for the right price.

26
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,920
I told you to give me a daily update.

27
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,440
Not much has happened.

28
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,200
I want Bunty.
Get him before anyone else does.

29
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,960
-Other agencies are also involved.
-They are not based in Mumbai.

30
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,840
You are.

31
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,400
I am asking you something!

32
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,640
Shivaji! Come here.

33
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,400
OUR COLA

34
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,040

1
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,080
Do you believe in God?

2
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,480
God doesn't give a fuck.

3
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,160
Yes, I knew...

4
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,760
how they have fucked you over
for 20 years.

5
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,480
Sometimes, I feel like I am God.

6
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,200
It's my story.

7
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,680
Everyone else is playing their part in it.

8
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,000
And I connect them together.

9
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,200
Bunty.

10
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,680
Where is Bunty?

11
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,800
Check inside your asshole.

12
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,360
-Listen.
-Yes, sir.

13
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,680
I want Sartaj.

14
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,240
-Today. Right now.
-Yes, sir.

15
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,440
I don't know how this world
came into existence,

16
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,360
but I do know how it will come to an end.

17
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,840
Okay, all right. Move back, move back.

18
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,480
It's a gruesome murder.
Must have been an expensive watch.

19
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,040
Expensive enough to get him killed.

20
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,400
Any witnesses?

21
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,600
None.

22
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,840
Sir, it's time for your hearing.

23
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,480
Parulkar will be pissed if you're late.

24
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,360
Just say what Parulkar wants you to.

25
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,400
Junaid had a weapon.

26
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,400
A homemade gun.

27
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,800
We warned him to surrender.

28
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,600
But he responded by firing...

29
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,040
at Constable Raut.

30
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,280
Constable Raut was shot and he fell down.

31
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,680
The boy tried to run away,

32
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,360
and Mr. Parulkar went after him.

33
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,200
We had the area sealed.
He couldn't have escaped.

34
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,960
He pointed the revolver at Mr. Parulkar.

35
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,160
Mr. Parulkar immediately warned him
to put it down,

36
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,760
but Junaid was going to pull the trigger.

37
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,560
Before he could fire...

38
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,400
Sir, before he could fire,
Mr. Parulkar fired three rounds at him.

39
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,080
What the fuck were you doing?

40
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,640
Did you forget what we told you?

41
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,640
Tell me.

42
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,480
-Are you going to turn us all in?
-What's happening?

43
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,960
Majid?

44
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,480
He was an 18-year-old kid.

45
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,640
Is there an age limit
to become a terrorist?

46
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,000
We could have arrested him.

47
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,360
Is he new here?

48
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,200
He was surrendering.

49
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,800
There's so much filth
in this city, Sartaj.

50
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,480
-We can't always follow procedure...
-Can you say that to his father?

51
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,560
Have you ever solved a case?

52
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,400
Do you want to be
the next Ramakant Jadhav?

53
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,840
-Google him, he tried to testify too.
-Majid...

54
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,280
Go see a doctor.

55
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,120
We'll talk tomorrow.

56
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,040
Okay.

57
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,680
Don't come.

58
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,000
Tomorrow's report will state
that you killed Junaid. Then what?

59
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,280
It's a good thing Megha left you.

60
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,160
He plays tennis.

61
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,600
Ever played tennis?

62
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,280
Ms. Megha is looking at us. Shall we go?

63
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,920
I won't ever forget

64
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,400
Neither will I

65
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,800
Once... Dad decided to take us
to the Golden Temple.

66
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,520
It was a big deal for us.

67
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,080
-Visiting Amritsar...
-Is the Golden Temple made of gold?

68
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,360
Listen.

69
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,040
The day we had to leave...

70
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,160
Dad was summoned to the police station.

71
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,600
There had been an accident.

72
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,280
A car had run over a beggar kid.

73
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,800
Someone had to go to the hospital.

74
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,320
Anyone could have gone.

75
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,720
But Dad canceled the trip to Amritsar.

76
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,840
I cried for days.

77
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,400
I stole a 10-rupee bill
from Dad's wallet and burned it.

78
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,240
Back in 1990.

79
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,040
Mom slapped me later.

80
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,880
You know what my dad said?

81
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,360
"I was meant to go and see that kid."

82
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,720
I wanted to be like my dad.

83
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,840
A good policeman.

84
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,520
Sir, you worry a lot.

85
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,560
Parulkar has the Inquiry Commission
in his pocket.

86
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,320
It doesn't matter what you do
or say at this point.

87
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,840
I was in the street... blocking the exit.

88
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,400
He came running towards me...

89
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,320
unarmed.

90
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,720
-He was in his late teens.
-Sir...

91
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,680
-He started crying when he saw me.
-Sir...

92
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,280
Sir, save me!

93
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,040
Parulkar came from the other side.

94
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,040
He's surrendering, sir!

95
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,880
I yelled out that he was surrendering...

96
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,040
but he shot him.

97
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,920
Sir, everything will be fine
once you solve a big case.

98
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,080
How will that happen?

99
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,840
In the last ten years, all I've managed
to do is catch Sonu, a pickpocket.

100
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,160
Sir,

101
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,040
do you believe in God?

102
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,480
Who is this?

103
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,760
Speak up, motherfucker. Who is this?

104
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,520
I want to tell you a story.

105
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,040
Go ahead.

106
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,320
-Who was it?
-I don't know. Some asshole.

107
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,040
Should I trace the number?

108
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,520
Fuck!

109
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,640
Forget about God.

110
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,080
Do you believe in magic?

111
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,640
Sometimes, I feel like my life is magical.

112
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
Are you crazy?

113
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,320
Why did you end up in the police force?

114
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,760
You wanted to be like Gavaskar,
but you're handling Tendulkar's security.

115
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,000
Who is this?

116
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,840
You have to save your city.

117
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,840
I heard you love this city.

118
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,840
Who is this?

119
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,640
An old friend of Dilbagh Singh.

120
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,280
How do you know my father?

121
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,920
Listen.

122
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,560
Your destiny will change.

123
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,560
-You'll change my destiny?
-We'll change each other's.

124
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,400
How?

125
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,840
If you tell them who called...

126
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,400
they'll forget about Sonu, the pickpocket.

127
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,360
Are you one of Ravi Pandit's guys?

128
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,240
Ravi Pandit is a little shit.

129
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,080
I wouldn't fuck with your sleep
for that nobody.

130
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,600
Stop bullshitting. Who are you?
Do you have a lead or not?

131
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,480
They're going to kill me.

132
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,760
I can't trust anyone in this city.

133
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,880
Then I remembered Dilbagh Singh.

134
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,800
Who's going to kill you?

135
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,800
How do you know Dilbagh Singh?

136
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,560
Mr. Sartaj, how I know him...

137
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,560
is not that easy to explain.

138
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,040
When I was 10 or 11 years old...

139
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,840
this day was decided.

140
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,680
This very moment... our connection...

141
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,000
you, Dilbagh Singh and I.

142
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,840
I could see my destiny in the water.

143
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,160
Ever since I was a kid, I've felt like
my life was a story from the scriptures.

144
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,760
Like the whole world, including my father,
was a part of my story.

145
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,240
The drought lasted for a thousand years
before Sage Gautama meditated

146
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,160
and manifested the River Ganges.

147
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,120
In my village,
the Ganges was known as the Godavari.

148
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,960
My father was a priest there,

149
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,640
but he was nothing more than a beggar.

150
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,000
Please help me.

151
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,000
Ma'am, help me.

152
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,400
Dad, is God everywhere?

153
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,800
Of course. He's everywhere.

154
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,560
He's in every grain of rice in this bag.

155
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,120
But he doesn't beg.

156
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,240
My father's weakness disgusted me.

157
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,560
That's when I decided
that I would be the master of my fate.

158
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,960
Sir, the DOT is tracing the number.

159
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,840
He's somewhere near the Metro Theater.

160
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,920
Tell me more.

161
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,000
My mother...

162
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,120
she was very affectionate.

163
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,560
I don't know how my dad found her.

164
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,880
Come here.

165
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,480
When it was dark...

166
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,720
she was the light in our lives.

167
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,760
How is it? Beautiful, right?

168
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,560
She always made herself beautiful
for that beggar.

169
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,000
Mom.

170
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,560
Mom, where did you get this from?

171
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,840
I knew this dream wouldn't last.

172
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,080
While my beggar father slept,
my mother stayed awake...

173
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,880
and she slept while he was awake.

174
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,600
She was only truly alive when he was gone.

175
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,160
Her world would come alive then.

176
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,960
What are you doing?
Are you crazy? Ganesh is sleeping.

177
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,880
So what? I want to sleep with you.

178
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,840
Come back when Ganesh is at school.

179
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,360
There's no school tomorrow. It's Sunday.
I want to do it now.

180
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,000
What are you doing? What if he wakes up?

181
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,440
Let him wake up.

182
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,800
You're going to hit me?
You son of a bitch!

183
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,280
Do you have the courage? You fucker!

184
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,160
Watch your mouth or I'll hit you.

185
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,080
Some of my childhood memories
are still fresh.

186
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,000
Why are you crying?

187
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,680
Because I tore your shirt?

188
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,400
Your whore of a mother
can buy you a new shirt every day.

189
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,960
And some of it feels like
it never happened.

190
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,720
Like it was a part of my past life.

191
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,160
It feels like yesterday
when I was running madly.

192
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,720
From the fields, from my home,
from the Godavari,

193
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,000
from my father's chanting,
and from his God.

194
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,320
And it feels like a lifetime

195
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,000
since I saw my mother.

196
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
What is religion?

197
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,160
The mother or the father?

198
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,200
Whatever it is, I was free of it now.

199
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,600
I needed a new religion.

200
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,440
Bombay.

201
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,680
What is it, sir?

202
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,560
Are you trying to find me?

203
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,080
Why would I be looking for you?

204
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,920
I'm hungry. I want eggs.

205
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,040
Should I get you a chicken?

206
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,040
Yes, I'm at the Metro Circle.
Do you know the name of the building?

207
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,360
Sir, he's somewhere close by.

208
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,320
The next street has the best Anda Pav.

209
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,440
Opposite Kyani.

210
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,960
I'm right there.

211
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,240
Come, let's eat together.

212
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,000
You'll find Sunil there.
Tell him I say hi.

213
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,960
He chops onions really fast.

214
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,800
Are you fucking around
with a signal scrambler?

215
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,520
I have a story to tell,
so I need your time.

216
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,320
-So I took you for a ride.
-I heard your story.

217
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,520
Your mom was a whore
and your dad was an asshole.

218
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,120
Watch your mouth, sir.

219
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,320
-Do you know who I am?
-A small-time thug

220
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,840
with a small dick and no balls.

221
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,640
Call a doctor
and stop fucking around with me.

222
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,680
RCN number 215578, 18th December, 2006.

223
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,600
My first case,

224
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,400
IPC 435, 28th March, 1984.
Kailashpada Police Station.

225
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,600
Look at the records to know
if I am a man or a god.

226
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,680
RCN number 215578, 18th December, 2006.

227
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,160
My first case,

228
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,160
IPC 435, 28th March, 1984.
Kailashpada Police Station.

229
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,720
My first case,

230
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,800
IPC 435, 28th March, 1984.
Kailashpada Police Station.

231
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,640
Look at the records to know...

232
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,480
Fuck, we're screwed!

233
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,360
Greetings.

234
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,520
I am speaking from Balochistan.

235
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,880
There's word
that a faction of ISI has gone rogue

236
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,000
and is smuggling fake currency into India.

237
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,680
They are planning something disastrous
against India with Hizbuddin's support.

238
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,280
I'm asking you to send help.

239
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,920
If you can get some Indian support
for our freedom,

240
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,560
I can give you some names.

241
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,320
Sir, we're closed.

242
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,200
I told you that I spoke to Mr. Parulkar.

243
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,680
Come back in the morning.
I need to enter it in the register.

244
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,840
It's an unusual situation.

245
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,320
You'll get a letter
from the DCP's office tomorrow.

246
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:19,960
Did you hear that?

247
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,840
He mentioned Kailashpada Police Station.
Did you hear that?

248
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,320
He's been missing for 17 years.

249
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,040
He hasn't been in India for 23 years.
It can't be him.

250
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,040
He has 158 murder cases against him.

251
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,080
He fucked both RAW and ISI
before disappearing.

252
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,240
-Where are the classified files?
-In that corner. Row number 30.

253
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,760
He must be crazy to come back.

254
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,440
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to hell.

255
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,000
215578.

256
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,760
215578.

257
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,520
"Ganesh Eknath...

258
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,480
Gaitonde."

259
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,000
Are you frightened?

260
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,360
What will you do now, Mr. Sartaj?

261
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,440
Why did you call me?

262
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,720
How can I tell you if you won't listen?

263
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,600
Where have you been for the past 15 years?

264
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,680
Singapore? Malaysia?

265
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,880
Right here in Zone 13.

266
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,000
Sir, it's a trap. Call for backup.

267
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,320
How will that help me?
I'll be back to doing the same old shit.

268
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,320
Parulkar and Majid will be pissed.

269
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,720
Fuck Majid.

270
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,320
-How far is it from there?
-Twenty minutes.

271
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,480
That's some speed.
Are you in love with Bombay now?

272
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,600
We live like cockroaches.

273
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,520
What's there to love?

274
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,000
Try going out at night.
If I didn't love this city...

275
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,560
I wouldn't have built my empire here
in the garbage dumps.

276
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,280
This is what Bombay is now.

277
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,440
An empire amongst garbage dumps.

278
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,040
That's the beauty of this city, sir.
Anything is possible.

279
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,880
In 1977, Indira Gandhi's Emergency
reigned over the country.

280
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,840
The government was sterilizing its people.

281
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,120
But Bombay... Bombay didn't slow down.

282
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,240
Everybody found work here.

283
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,200
I benefited from being a Brahmin's son.

284
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,320
SATYANARAYAN SHUKLA
UPPER-CASTE HINDU HOTEL - PURE VEGETARIAN

285
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,360
Shukla Seth, Hindu Hotel.

286
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,600
A regular meal for 8 rupees,
a deluxe meal for 12 rupees.

287
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,880
Hurry up!

288
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,240
They used baking soda in the rice
and fake ghee in the dal.

289
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,920
Why are you touching the rice
with your dirty hands?

290
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,160
This is the Hindu Hotel!

291
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,640
People don't come here
because we serve good food.

292
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:11,240
They come because everything here
is clean and pure.

293
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,280
Everyone from the cook to the waiter
belongs to the upper caste.

294
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,680
Religion found business in purity.

295
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,960
I made sin a business.

296
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,200
Bombay had a booming market for drugs.

297
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,280
I wanted to dig in.

298
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
Mandrax.

299
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,280
One pill costs 10 rupees.

300
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,760
Two for you and eight for Mathu.

301
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,280
Don't lick it, swallow it.

302
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,400
Okay.

303
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,720
Mandrax gives you the ultimate kick.

304
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,560
The craving for it will grow
with every passing day.

305
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,880
It's the best business.

306
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,360
Mathu taught me how to sell.

307
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,040
If the guy had red eyes and dark circles,
he would definitely buy Mandrax.

308
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,720
I could have been high on Mandrax,
or under a spell.

309
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,360
Shukla Seth beat me black and blue,
but I felt no pain.

310
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,600
Bastard! Son of a whore!
I told you, no bullshit here.

311
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,400
Ever since then,
I've known that I am Ashwathama.

312
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,840
I'm immortal.

313
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,760
Sir, you haven't given me my salary.

314
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,520
You don't do any work,
and then you ask for a salary?

315
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,920
Work for three more months.

316
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,560
I haven't gotten anything
for two months, sir.

317
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,880
You will.

318
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,920
My dickhead boss owned a scooter,

319
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,560
but he drove it like it was Isa's red car.

320
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,600
I'll tell you about Isa later.

321
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,880
I fantasized about his red car.

322
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,880
I wanted it.

323
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,480
-Eat.
-Mathu told me to be brave.

324
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,080
Being brave meant becoming a sinner.

325
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,680
Don't think so much.
Think of it as a vegetable,

326
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,760
not a dead bird.

327
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:37,360
Rip it and eat it like a jackfruit.
Try it.

328
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,320
A chicken bone in a Hindu hotel
can cause more damage than any gangster.

329
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,640
It's been happening
since pre-independence days.

330
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,120
To create a rift amongst the Muslims,
dump pork in a mosque.

331
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,200
To incite riots amongst the Hindus,

332
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,920
dump beef in a temple.

333
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,400
And for a devout Hindu, a bone was enough.

334
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,800
From the Hindu Hotel I learned
how religion can fuck anyone over.

335
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,400
I had much more to learn.

336
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,400
I had to meet Mathu's boss, Salim Kaka.

337
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,600
Salim Kaka.

338
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,120
An Afghan bull,
the king of gold smuggling.

339
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,760
My second father.

340
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,680
Are you done? Now give me the tip.

341
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,560
Close your eyes and chant
"I am Lord Brahma."

342
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,000
What?

343
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,880
I am the alpha and the omega.

344
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,760
Everything will become clear.

345
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,160
Your thoughts... will turn into reality.

346
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:08,280
If God wasn't real, how would we
have conceived the idea of him?

347
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,680
God talks to us through stories.

348
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,720
Our lives...

349
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,840
are the stories.

350
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,840
Someone is monitoring the call.

351
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,360
What?

352
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,680
You have 25 days to save your city.

353
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,440
Twenty-five days?
What will happen in 25 days?

354
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,840
-Where are you?
-I don't know, sir.

355
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,240
I'm almost there.

356
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,040
-Sorry, sir.
-Don't hang up!

357
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,360
Fuck!

358
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,000
It's auto-erasing from a remote server.

359
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,360
-I don't think we'll get anything.
-We have this, right?

360
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,680
I don't know what it is.

361
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,920
Listen, was there ever a garbage dump
in Zone 13?

362
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,640
Garbage?

363
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,840
-Yes...
-He said...

364
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,120
There was one, sir. A long time ago.

365
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,880
Around 25, 30 years ago.

366
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,120
There's a mall there now. DMD Mall.

367
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,280
You can try using dynamite,
but this door won't open.

368
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,360
Save your city, Mr. Sartaj.

369
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,160
Sit on the chair.

370
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,000
Eager to nab me, aren't you?

371
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,880
-What will happen in 25 days?
-Everyone is going to die in 25 days.

372
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,040
Only Trivedi will be safe.

373
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,680
Who's Trivedi?

374
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,800
An asshole. Fuck him.

375
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,400
Why will he be safe?

376
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,480
My father is going to fuck everyone,
but I'll save Trivedi.

377
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,360
Which father? The village priest?

378
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,480
No, sir. I have three fathers.

379
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,880
All three of them fucked me up.

380
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,080
The first one instilled fear in me,
the second gave me guts.

381
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,840
The last one,
the one I loved the most, betrayed me.

382
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,240
How?

383
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,720
The first father was a priest.
I didn't want to be like him.

384
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,440
The second father, Salim Kaka,
whose eyes told me,

385
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,680
"Gaitonde, if you kill me,
you'll become immortal.

386
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,480
You are Ashwathama!"

387
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,480
Hop on.

388
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,360
Sit down.

389
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,400
Don't utter a word.

390
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,200
I told you not to do it.

391
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,760
Salim Kaka was also known
as the ball-breaker.

392
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,440
He'd squeeze the balls so hard
that the brain would burst

393
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,960
and the person would be dead in minutes.

394
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,920
Salim Kaka had done this 14 times.
Mathu was petrified.

395
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,880
So was I, but I had made up my mind.

396
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,720
You want to be brave, go ahead. I won't.

397
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,640
You told me to be brave.

398
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,400
This box has so much money,
you'll never have to sell Mandrax again.

399
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,520
Do you even know what being brave means?

400
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,520
Those six assholes over there
know what it means.

401
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,840
But will they do it?

402
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,480
You're out of your mind.

403
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,320
Put it down.

404
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,600
It's empty now, but it has killed
two people. Keep it safe. It's done.

405
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,320
Salim Kaka may have been a smuggler,
but he was actually a demon.

406
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,000
My conscience told me
to free this fucker's soul.

407
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,760
We had learned
the tricks of smuggling gold.

408
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,720
Now Salim Kaka was of no use to us.

409
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,080
You!

410
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,600
Motherfucker!

411
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,160
Why did you throw it, motherfucker?

412
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,160
Hit this motherfucker!

413
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,680
Motherfucker!

414
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,000
Enough!

415
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,120
Enough!

416
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,520
Stop it, he's dead!

417
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,760
Everyone was scared.

418
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,000
They looked at Salim Kaka's corpse
with utter disbelief.

419
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,560
No one said anything to me.

420
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,880
No one shot me. No one praised me.

421
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,760
Does this happen to you?

422
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,840
When you kill someone,
you visualize yourself as that person.

423
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:20,600
I've seen myself
in every person I have killed.

424
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,000
Gaitonde, open the door!

425
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,160
Your game will be over soon.

426
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,040
Don't do this, sir.

427
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,400
My mind has never been so fucked up,
and I have more to tell.

428
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,480
We'll listen to the rest of it in jail.

429
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,800
There will be nothing left in 25 days.

430
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,000
Come on!

431
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,760
-Harder!
-Harder!

432
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,240
Raise the shovel and hit it!

433
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,480
Dilbagh Singh introduced me
to my third father.

434
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,080
Go!

435
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,120
-What?
-I called you up to return his favor.

436
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,760
Who did my father introduce you to? When?

437
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,280
Gaitonde!

438
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,520
What did you say?

439
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,720
Come with me peacefully.

440
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,280
Who did Dilbagh Singh introduce you to?

441
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,560
Put the gun down!

442
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,000
It's not over yet, Mr. Sartaj.

443
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,720
I told you, I am Ashwathama.

444
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,280
I won't die.

445
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,440
I'm not going anywhere
till the game is over.

446
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,160
Come on, Mr. Sartaj.

447
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:11,040
Now we'll be together when it destroys us.

448
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,360
Holy shit!

449
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,480
Do you believe in God?

450
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,560

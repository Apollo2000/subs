1
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,260
One of you is responsible for
my cargo being hit.

2
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,880
<i>Lale's dealing.
I got it off one of</i>

3
00:00:22,904 --> 00:00:24,540
<i>her men. Shouldn't
have done that.</i>

4
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,780
We let Asif trade.

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,340
Doing a lot of second-guessing
lately, partner.

6
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,077
Eddie, They say you
are the keeper of Finn's

7
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:33,820
<i>secrets. But you didn't
know about this one?</i>

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,940
Do you think about your
wife Naomi? Course I do.

9
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,940
If it was a woman,
she didn't love my husband.

10
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,620
We're not picking the flesh
off a dead man's bones.

11
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,613
If they were to kill my son, I

12
00:00:43,637 --> 00:00:45,740
would wipe out their blood line.

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,020
Without hesitation.

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,380
Anyone not helping find Dad's
killer looks suspect to me.

15
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,260
Ara!

16
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,700
'He made everyone rich.'

17
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,700
Why would anyone
want to kill him?

18
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,940
We've gone through everything.

19
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,140
I can't find a reason.

20
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,260
<i>The business is solid.
We've got a global reach.</i>

21
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,010
You can't build towers fast

22
00:06:01,034 --> 00:06:03,260
<i>enough. We're
giving great returns.</i>

23
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,452
I want us to keep doing that.

24
00:06:05,476 --> 00:06:07,940
It's what Finn
would have wanted.

25
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,220
I know how close you were.

26
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,420
Closer than I was.

27
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,580
You should have his office.

28
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,137
I like building towers. I don't

29
00:06:17,161 --> 00:06:18,860
like being shut up inside them.

30
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,940
I failed you last night.

31
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,548
I went along with
you to make sure

32
00:06:34,572 --> 00:06:35,980
things didn't get out of hand.

33
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,979
And now that
campsite is all over

34
00:06:38,003 --> 00:06:40,100
<i>the news. That
cannot happen again.</i>

35
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,780
We need to know who used
those gypsies.

36
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,500
Luan owes us a conversation.

37
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,698
Sean... He knows what my dad was

38
00:06:48,722 --> 00:06:51,100
doing that night,
on his territory.

39
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,324
As for Asif, I know
you both think giving

40
00:06:53,348 --> 00:06:55,660
him special treatment
is good for business,

41
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,580
but the tap stays
off. I mean it.

42
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,238
And giving Asif
special treatment

43
00:07:01,262 --> 00:07:02,660
was what set Lale after him.

44
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,500
I'll take care of Lale. No!

45
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,547
If my father were sitting here,

46
00:07:09,571 --> 00:07:11,660
he'd have expected it of you.

47
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,060
But it's me she went against.

48
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,580
I'll take care of Lale.

49
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,900
<i>Shoot! I'm gonna
get you. Pow! Pow!</i>

50
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,220
Shoot! Shoo-ooot!

51
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,660
Girls! School now!

52
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,980
Pow pow! Shoot!

53
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,580
<i>Hi. Just these, please.
Let's go down!</i>

54
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,260
Pow! Pow!

55
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,420
Urgh!

56
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,580
He eats too much anyway!

57
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,300
Oh, excuse me, ladies!

58
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,140
<i>Goodbye, Auntie. Bye, Auntie.
Bye.</i>

59
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,620
If I'd given you the heads-up
about the campsite,

60
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,060
we'd have caught Sean Wallace
gun in hand

61
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,620
and all of this'd be done.

62
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,140
<i>But instead we are here...
and you are alive.</i>

63
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,420
A Wallace family driver.

64
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,204
The perfect place to be the next

65
00:09:57,228 --> 00:09:58,780
time Sean puts a foot wrong.

66
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,380
<i>I'm serious. Drivers get
to hear and see everything.</i>

67
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,820
Hm, that's probably why Jack
ended up dead.

68
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,940
Look, I get that it's you
in the firing line, Elliot,

69
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,505
but Finn Wallace's enemies used

70
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:12,980
to disappear without a trace,

71
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,860
as did all of the witnesses.

72
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,020
Given the way Sean's
going about things,

73
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,300
and with you right there
in the loop,

74
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,135
we can give the
jury evidence that

75
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,820
is way beyond reasonable doubt.

76
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,620
At the hint of anyone else
in danger, including you,

77
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,580
you stop it - even if it means
blowing your cover.

78
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:02,980
<i>Eddie. They say you are
the keeper of Finn's secrets.</i>

79
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,020
But you didn't know
about this one?

80
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,300
Ah! Mrs Wallace.

81
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,300
Good to see you, Serwa.

82
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,180
Please, take a seat.

83
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,620
Your husband was one hell
of a squirrel, Mrs Wallace.

84
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,500
Everything well
hidden and then some.

85
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,460
False leads, dead ends...

86
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,780
But we got there. You always do.

87
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,540
He spent 36 million on it.

88
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:47,460
<i>We had to pay over the odds...
to drill down on this.</i>

89
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,100
That's not a problem.

90
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,540
The island cost him
around 180 million.

91
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,540
Building a new life.

92
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,780
<i>He renamed about...
six months ago.</i>

93
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,900
The Floriana.

94
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,140
Pretty name.

95
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,020
Your husband's driver... Jack.

96
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,820
<i>Nothing came up on him.
No debts, no oddities...</i>

97
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,420
<i>Thank you.
And the other thing...?</i>

98
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,860
Everything.

99
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,220
Everyone.

100
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,900
<i>Wait. If they find that I talk
to you, they will kill me.</i>

101
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,700
They won't find out.

102
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,140
Listen...

103
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,357
My neighbour, she
disappears the night

104
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:31,540
the old man is shot
outside her apartment,

105
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,860
<i>that's all I know!
Tell me about her.</i>

106
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,020
If we can find her,
we can make her safe.

107
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,340
We're from the same village!

108
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,700
From Albania.

109
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,780
We came together a year ago,
without papers.

110
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:53,300
<i>Floriana... Floriana,
that's your neighbour?</i>

111
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,620
Yes.

112
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,940
She was supposed to escape.

113
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,740
The old man who was killed,
was he visiting Floriana?

114
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,100
She's going to have his baby.

115
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,700
<i>What are you doing here?
Just waiting for Billy.</i>

116
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,700
Wait outside.

117
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,140
Thank you.

118
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,820
Did you meet her?

119
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,660
Floriana?

120
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,780
No.

121
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,380
And he always
told you everything.

122
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,100
Jack would have
known, wouldn't he?

123
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,500
Jack would have
known everything.

124
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,340
Hey hey! There he is!

125
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,020
You sure you don't
want to drive as well?

126
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,666
You, er, you
didn't kick up a fuss

127
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,300
<i>about last night.
At the kebab shop.</i>

128
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,740
No point.

129
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,300
<i>What's your story, Elliot? How
did you end up doing all this?</i>

130
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,660
<i>Tried out for the priesthood.
I couldn't get in.</i>

131
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,180
Are you helping Sean out today
as well?

132
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,340
Why? You lost him again?

133
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,340
He's got me picking
someone up. Oh, yeah?

134
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,780
<i>Yeah. Er, somebody
called... Cole.</i>

135
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,620
Cole? Yeah.

136
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,380
Jesus Christ.

137
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,140
Sean's lost his fucking mind.

138
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,340
What?

139
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,100
Don't let him in here.

140
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,380
Where are you going?

141
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,020
Nice knowing you, Elliot.

142
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,220
What's that supposed to mean?!

143
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,940
Where to?

144
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,860
<i>I can help you out...
if it's OK with Mr Wallace.</i>

145
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,980
Take the next right.

146
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,060
Up at the end.

147
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,980
<i>Do you want me to wait?
No, you can fuck off.</i>

148
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,100
I'm keen to remind you that
these are still my contacts.

149
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,980
Luan, good to see you again.

150
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,740
And you, Mosi.

151
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,580
You're building this one fast.

152
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,860
My money? Will be washed

153
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,581
through the Wallace organisation

154
00:21:10,605 --> 00:21:11,740
in the next few days.

155
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,860
Even with Mr
Wallace in the ground.

156
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,757
<i>His death is a gift.
Mr Wallace had</i>

157
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:19,580
been the sole
trader for too long,

158
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,260
and his son is a fuck-up.

159
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,380
He's not even Finn's shadow.

160
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,060
This an be an
opportunity for us, Mosi.

161
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,015
We can build something bigger

162
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,300
than the Wallaces
ever dreamed of.

163
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:39,340
Mosi! Mosi, I beg you!

164
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,340
Mosi! MOSI!

165
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,380
Mosi!

166
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,580
I'm sorry!

167
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,140
I'm sorry, Mosi!

168
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,060
You build me a building.

169
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,780
Make me money.

170
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,020
Then we'll talk more.

171
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,300
Please!

172
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,340
Come in.

173
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,780
Fine.

174
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,260
Let's have a look.

175
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,420
<i>You got it clean, then?
Oh. Yeah.</i>

176
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,660
Yeah.

177
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,100
Er, I'm here to pick up...

178
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,420
That rug.

179
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,140
And me?

180
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,580
Give me five minutes?

181
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,020
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Cool.

182
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,100
Hey!

183
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,660
Wanna play?

184
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,460
See if you're better
than my mum.

185
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,820
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

186
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,940
This is your driver?

187
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,500
I'd get dumped. What?

188
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,679
As soon as a boy
found out I was Ed.

189
00:24:22,703 --> 00:24:24,260
Dumani's daughter,
I'd get dumped.

190
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,900
Oh, no. It wasn't your dad.

191
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,140
It was the look Danny gave me.

192
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,180
I am nowhere near as good as
his mum.

193
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,540
Yeah, well, I get
a lot of practice.

194
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,620
He said his dad's in Australia?

195
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,620
Yeah, he might as well be.

196
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,500
That's what I tell Danny.

197
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,340
He's in prison and he's
not getting out anytime soon.

198
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,380
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

199
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,220
I'm not.

200
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,100
No-one is.

201
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,580
The lights are
supposed to come on.

202
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,300
Hello?

203
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,740
<i>Ah! 35 floors of luxury
apartments, Elliot.</i>

204
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,820
<i>No-one lives here.
Why would they?</i>

205
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,140
Where do you want this?

206
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,620
Over there, please.

207
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,100
Two?

208
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,660
Yeah.

209
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,260
Here?

210
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,460
Sorry. It's OK.

211
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:01,140
<i>Wow. How many of
these has Sean built?</i>

212
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,500
<i>Six or seven. A lot
more on the way.</i>

213
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:08,740
I mean, I could wake up to this.

214
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,340
He had a battle getting
this one as tall as he wanted.

215
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,427
I don't think his dad ever

216
00:26:14,451 --> 00:26:16,540
appreciated just
how good Sean is.

217
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,300
You don't want to get
in that boy's way.

218
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,740
And you?

219
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,940
You... You do the interiors?

220
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,860
Yeah. It's a family business.

221
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,260
It's clever, that.

222
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,780
Laundering into your own
buildings, inside and out.

223
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,980
So what do you think?

224
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,900
About the rugs?

225
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,180
Yeah, um...

226
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,900
Well...

227
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:20,500
Er... I-I'm married.

228
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,460
Take me home, then.

229
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,820
Cheers. Bye bye.

230
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,980
Hurry up there, yeah?

231
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,580
When I went to pay my respects,

232
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,020
Sean treated me with contempt.

233
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,420
Give me one good
reason to stay, Ed.

234
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,220
Sean wants this to work.

235
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,160
He wants to maintain
the continuity of

236
00:29:33,184 --> 00:29:35,500
Alexander running the
financial services side.

237
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:39,260
OK... OK.

238
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,460
Now let me ask you this...

239
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:47,300
Why would this woman, Lale,
steal from me?

240
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,820
It's a death sentence.

241
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,460
Maybe you have
a history with her.

242
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:56,700
Oh, I have a history
with a lot of people.

243
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,860
Most of them are smart enough
not to attack me.

244
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,940
We'll take care of her.

245
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,540
Like the gypsy camp?

246
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,860
London is good for business

247
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,300
because of mutual discipline
between rival interests.

248
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,740
If this unravels... It will not.

249
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,860
<i>That was anger.
This will be business.</i>

250
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,700
Always the quiet player.

251
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,592
I'm sure you know
a great deal more

252
00:30:27,616 --> 00:30:30,100
than you're telling
any one of us.

253
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,100
Does Sean even know
we're having this meeting?

254
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,660
Cole, let me know
when you have them.

255
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,940
'Understood.'

256
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,380
We have to get this done
before Sean has a chance.

257
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,940
This is where you'll dump Lale.

258
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,180
<i>This is between me and you.
No-one else.</i>

259
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,340
Not Sean.

260
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,100
Ever. Understood?

261
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,049
My daughter
seemed... troubled when

262
00:31:31,073 --> 00:31:33,540
you brought her back last night.

263
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,780
Not by me.

264
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,740
And my grandson had a lot of
questions about you.

265
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,900
I didn't know what to tell him.

266
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,420
Let's go find Lale.

267
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,820
Something's wrong. Be careful.

268
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:12,220
<i>Sean, what have you done?
Destroy the drive.</i>

269
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,860
But those two girls -
Just destroy the drive.

270
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,020
You do not say or do anything.

271
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,020
You go home
and you wait for my call.

272
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,660
Fuck. Fuck!

273
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,660
Export documents.

274
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,780
<i>We're all good, then.
But we do this on our own.</i>

275
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,300
<i>No. My driver takes you
to the airport.</i>

276
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,196
You don't get to choose. You've

277
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,980
lost your Wallace protection.

278
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:59,380
So get the fuck out of my
face, leave your van with us,

279
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,301
go back to your
car, be grateful I

280
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,500
don't cut you another
mouth, all right?

281
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,060
OK.

282
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,580
We'll follow you to the
airport. Don't speed.

283
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,140
Yes, ma'am.

284
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,491
Good evening to you
all. Thank you all for

285
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:06,900
<i>coming. It's good to see
so many friendly faces.</i>

286
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:10,740
We all have to ask ourselves,
what are we doing here?

287
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,302
Because all the best, well-paid

288
00:37:12,326 --> 00:37:13,580
careers and opportunities

289
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,060
are for the children of
the privileged few, right?

290
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,100
Yeah! That right?

291
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,860
Wrong!

292
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,011
Each one of you
have a head start in

293
00:37:22,035 --> 00:37:24,340
what firms like ours
are looking for...

294
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,620
street smarts, tech skills,
social media fanatics.

295
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:31,300
Now, Finn Wallace, who
was the CEO of our firm,

296
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,860
<i>he didn't start at the top.
He fought his way up.</i>

297
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,843
It's one of the reasons
he was so passionate

298
00:37:35,867 --> 00:37:37,700
about giving young
people a helping hand.

299
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,637
So, how do we get from where we

300
00:37:39,661 --> 00:37:41,580
are now to where we want to be?

301
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,154
We do what the
rich and powerful do.

302
00:37:45,178 --> 00:37:47,580
We grab, we steal, we push in...

303
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,975
Start tonight. Make yourself

304
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:50,660
known to the people
who work here.

305
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,380
Start off thinking
yourself equal...

306
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:56,500
Then believe you can do better
than them. Hm?

307
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,700
Thank you.

308
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,980
Thank you.

309
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,460
<i>Well done.
That was a very good speech.</i>

310
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,540
<i>Congratulations. Thanks,
Jevan. Thanks for coming.</i>

311
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,673
Nice to get a photo
here. Over here,

312
00:38:26,697 --> 00:38:28,820
<i>Mrs Wallace. Mrs
Wallace, back over here.</i>

313
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,600
Thank you.Wow. I mean, they're

314
00:38:30,624 --> 00:38:32,500
all fired up, that was inspired.

315
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:35,146
<i>Thank you. It was
Finn's vision to position</i>

316
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:37,500
us as a progressive
force in the City.

317
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,786
I just want to push on with

318
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,260
that. It's what you need to be.

319
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,380
People are interested in your
business model.

320
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,473
Now, if you can
ride out the waves

321
00:38:46,497 --> 00:38:48,220
caused by Finn's
departure, then...

322
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,157
Finn kept a lot of his contacts

323
00:38:50,181 --> 00:38:52,220
<i>hidden. I can
make introductions.</i>

324
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,740
I'd appreciate that.

325
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,980
It's not a problem.

326
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,180
Excuse me, just one second.

327
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,300
Where's Sean?

328
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,854
<i>I don't know. Did
he tell you how</i>

329
00:39:12,878 --> 00:39:14,460
he was going to
take care of Lale?

330
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,702
<i>He's hired in Cole!
Cole has Lale's</i>

331
00:39:16,726 --> 00:39:18,580
sister and the two daughters.

332
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,740
Sean wouldn't -
He's hired in Cole!

333
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,202
There's only one reason for

334
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:23,980
<i>hiring in Cole.
Think it through!</i>

335
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,740
<i>What's happened?
Your son's what's happened.</i>

336
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,840
Hey!

337
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,880
In English.

338
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:10,560
If Sean Wallace doesn't make
contact, he will kill them.

339
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,040
'He won't stop unless you
bring Wallace the money!

340
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,280
<i>I'm begging you, please!
I'm begging you!'</i>

341
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,080
'That's enough.'

342
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,560
The line goes dead.

343
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,840
'So sorry.'

344
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,520
Maybe I'm not the one
you should be apologising to.'

345
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:30,120
No! No no no!

346
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,240
Please!

347
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,640
You move, I'll kill them.

348
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,873
Stay -Hey! Listen to me! Listen!

349
00:44:14,897 --> 00:44:16,520
How the fuck did
you get up here?

350
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,720
<i>I took the fucking lift.
Look, I've got food.</i>

351
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,920
<i>I've got food for the kids.
They're not hungry.</i>

352
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,280
Shut up! Sean sent me.

353
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,680
You're fucking b...

354
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,720
Hey! Hey, hey. Get in there!

355
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,320
In there! Go go go!

356
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,920
<i>Quickly. Well done.
It's just hide-and-seek.</i>

357
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,520
<i>It's just...
It's just hide-and-seek.</i>

358
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,440
It's just hide-and-seek.

359
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
You don't have to harm them!

360
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,280
Please! Please don't harm them!

361
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:03,720
You go against everything
I said, this is what happens.

362
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,360
What do you want?

363
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,600
Let's start... with the money.

364
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,880
It's gone.

365
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,080
Well, that's that, then.

366
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,880
Please, don't harm them.

367
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,560
Yeah, yeah, it's Elliot.

368
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,720
I'm in a bit of a situation.

369
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,320
Hey! Ssh!

370
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,160
He got you too, did he?

371
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,640
<i>Where is he?
Are you all right, mate?</i>

372
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,440
You wanted that money
more than those kids.

373
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:40,200
It was for food, for clothes,
medicine, weapons.

374
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,120
<i>It wasn't for me!
It was for my people.</i>

375
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,520
<i>I wasn't going against you.
It was against Asif!</i>

376
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,880
Asif had small traders like us
squashed.

377
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,960
Asif... had my husband tortured.

378
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,520
Yet he won't even remember
our names.

379
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,800
Look!

380
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,440
Call him! Call him!

381
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,280
Tell me those children are safe!

382
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,200
Call him! Call him!

383
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,760
Call your man and stop him
from hurting them!

384
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,480
Call... him!

385
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,440
I was never going
to harm them. Never!

386
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,880
Cole won't do anything
unless I order it.

387
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,840
You think I'd kill kids?

388
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,520
That's you!

389
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:44,520
While your sister pleaded
down the phone to save them.

390
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,160
Can't do it, can you?

391
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,080
Your father would.

392
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,720
Do it!

393
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,360
Just fucking do it!

394
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,120
Open your eyes.

395
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,280
Surprise!

396
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,280
Your fruity loops
never took off.

397
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,080
No! No!

398
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,920
No! No-ooo!

399
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,000
No!

400
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,560
No-ooo! No-ooo!

401
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,760
Ssh!

402
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,600
Come here! This way! Out you go!

403
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,520
Keep going, keep going.

404
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,400
Get out!

405
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,520
Oh, fuck!

406
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,960
Fuck!

407
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,000
Stop!

408
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,440
I want you watching.

409
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,640
All that pain you
feel right now...

410
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,240
it's all for nothing.

411
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,440
Please! No!

412
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,962
You thought you
could deal and ship

413
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:51,720
without us knowing
where and when?

414
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,800
This isn't about the money.

415
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,840
You're the only one I can rule
out from killing my father.

416
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,800
<i>You wouldn't have done it.
You need us too much.</i>

417
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,280
And you'd be so
fucked without us.

418
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,450
You want to buy
food, medicine and

419
00:55:14,474 --> 00:55:16,440
weapons, more
than you ever have...

420
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:23,040
I'd want it run as
a real business.

421
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,320
<i>You could be as big as Asif.
Bigger.</i>

422
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:32,120
Why? Why would you do that?

423
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,920
Ever since I took over,

424
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,960
people keep telling
me to do this, do that...

425
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,000
Don't ever go against me again.

426
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,480
And don't steal from Asif.

427
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,600
Unless I tell you to.

1
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,100
Cheers. Cheers.

2
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,180
Cheers.

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,100
The business
that you helped Finn build,

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,967
the people that
invested in it, they

5
00:00:17,991 --> 00:00:19,740
want you to keep
running it. What?

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,980
They don't want Sean
anywhere near it.

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,540
<i>They tried to kill him?
They killed Finn.</i>

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,743
<i>Sean summoned me. He
spent the last week hiding</i>

9
00:00:27,767 --> 00:00:29,660
out with his mum and
Billy in a safe house.

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,580
Why would this woman 'Lale'
steal from me?

11
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,220
It's a death sentence.

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,952
Maybe you have
a history with her.

13
00:00:35,976 --> 00:00:37,740
You've hurt us,
now we've hurt you.

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,980
And that's why you came to kill

15
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:42,220
me. They were told to hit us

16
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,652
when Ed and Alex weren't

17
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:45,620
there. The night of the dinner,

18
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,180
<i>you and Ed didn't show. I told
you, we were running late.</i>

19
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,780
You did this favour for Finn,
we washed your money.

20
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,340
<i>And careful.
Mosi as a business partner</i>

21
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,500
is a dangerous man
to be making promises to.

22
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,820
Someone's just
stolen Luan's money.

23
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,180
That's half a billion!

24
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,500
Everything I do
is to protect this family.

25
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,860
Everything.

26
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,020
Well, stop.

27
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,460
<i>I don't want to argue.
Look, it's done, I'm out.</i>

28
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,220
What do you mean you're done?

29
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,540
Are you crazy? Seriously.

30
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,860
Thirty years, Finn.

31
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,140
Thirty years!

32
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,180
She's a child,
you're a grown man!

33
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,420
You could have grandchildren
older than her!

34
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,140
<i>Where's your dignity?! Dignity
is what I'm taking back!</i>

35
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,460
Come on.

36
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,660
Marian will find
you and kill you.

37
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,260
Both of you.

38
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,260
Yeah.

39
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,100
No.

40
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,860
No she won't.

41
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,740
Because you are gonna
make sure she never finds out.

42
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,220
You took us there!

43
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,500
What you know about them,
you can't just walk away!

44
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,580
<i>It's done, Ed. It's
over to you now.</i>

45
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,980
<i>Alexander runs the money.
Let Sean build his buildings.</i>

46
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,420
I'm giving you everything, Ed,

47
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,540
and all you have to do
is keep this to yourself.

48
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,540
That's all you have to do.

49
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,820
Finn!

50
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,140
You can't just walk away!

51
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,140
It's all yours now, Ed!

52
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,420
We met as young teenagers
on the streets of London.

53
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,780
A city of closed doors.

54
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,700
By the time we were done...

55
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,900
there would not be
one single door in this city

56
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,100
that we could not get behind.

57
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,620
He led, I followed.

58
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,286
And I am so proud to have worked

59
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,180
for the man all these years.

60
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,700
I dedicate my heart
and soul to you.

61
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,300
Hello, this is Dave's Mechanics.

62
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,799
Please leave a message after the

63
00:05:03,823 --> 00:05:05,260
beep and we'll get back to you.

64
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,380
Vic. Yeah, it's me.

65
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,660
Listen.

66
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,608
I'm looking at a lot of faces on

67
00:05:10,632 --> 00:05:12,620
my wall and
something is missing.

68
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,860
Someone is missing.

69
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,420
There's someone
else above all this.

70
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,140
You need to
get these shipments moving.

71
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,140
I'm with him.

72
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,980
I don't want any
more hold-ups. OK.

73
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,300
Let's go faster. OK.

74
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,500
Go!

75
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,180
Does Luan know?

76
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,834
No, he's unaware
that the transfer

77
00:07:36,858 --> 00:07:38,260
didn't go through last night.

78
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,140
<i>How long have we got? We don't
need a war with the Albanians.</i>

79
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,300
Not long.

80
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,220
Luan's in business
with Uche Mossanya...

81
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,980
Uche Mossanya?

82
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,300
'Mosi'.

83
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,140
Nigerian gangster. Nasty.

84
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,660
The money's owed to him.

85
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,597
Luan's the only person standing

86
00:07:55,621 --> 00:07:57,180
between us at the moment.

87
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,540
Who the fuck did this?

88
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,060
Who got into our accounts
and stole half a billion?

89
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,100
I'm working on
it. We'll find it.

90
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,540
Where are you?

91
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,900
I'm at the Belvedere Tower

92
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,660
watching the contractors
sign off on the new build.

93
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,580
It's looking very
impressive, Sean,

94
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,180
I think you're going to
be very happy with it.

95
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,937
We need to stick closer than

96
00:08:19,961 --> 00:08:21,940
ever if we want to survive this.

97
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,420
You know you don't
need to say that, Sean.

98
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,700
Don't I?

99
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,100
You're not always there when
someone takes a shot at me.

100
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,820
He knows I'm lying.

101
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,788
We can't keep this
up. We should've

102
00:08:44,812 --> 00:08:46,260
just told him in the beginning.

103
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,740
Told him what, Alex?

104
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,940
That his father didn't
believe in him enough

105
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,540
to trust him with the business?

106
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,660
That he wanted you to run it
instead?

107
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,420
That he was going to run off
and leave his family?

108
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,580
And all while Sean was
preparing his father's grave?

109
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,302
Or should I have
told him even our

110
00:09:01,326 --> 00:09:03,420
investors want him
dead and you in charge?

111
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,020
I was protecting him.

112
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,660
<i>Fucking Finn.
What if it's worse?</i>

113
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,100
Worse?

114
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,733
You didn't know
about Finn's deal

115
00:09:10,757 --> 00:09:12,420
with Luan and the
Albanian family.

116
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,100
What else do you think Finn
hadn't told you?

117
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,900
Must've crossed your mind.

118
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,980
He had both the access and the
knowledge to take that money.

119
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,900
He's dead, Alex.

120
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,620
Doesn't mean he hadn't already
set the wheels in motion.

121
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,420
Then that would mean...

122
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,620
he fucked us all.

123
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,380
Hekar. Hekar!

124
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,280
The place belonged to
a Tove Frandsen.

125
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,120
Mercenary from Denmark.

126
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,800
Special Forces.

127
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,320
When you raid the place,

128
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,920
you'll find the weapons cache
next to her kids' toys.

129
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,117
The licensed taxi
you were looking

130
00:15:19,141 --> 00:15:21,320
for is registered
to a Leif Hansen

131
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,840
at a different address.

132
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,320
OK.

133
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,120
Anything else?

134
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,600
Why don't you look surprised?

135
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,240
Someone broke into my flat
a week ago...

136
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,040
took a box cutter to my mouth,

137
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,160
in my sleep,
and sent me the video.

138
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,920
They're trying to warn me off
Floriana.

139
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,560
Why didn't you tell me?

140
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,960
Finn's murder enquiry
has been shut down.

141
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,520
I don't know who to trust.

142
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,360
You can trust me.

143
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,000
Armed Police!

144
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,240
We have entered the property
at location one.

145
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,640
<i>Arriving at second location.
Armed police!</i>

146
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,680
Entering property two.

147
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,720
- Clear!
- Property one clear.

148
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,880
Starting search and sweep
property two.

149
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,760
All clear property one. Over.

150
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,680
All clear, Ma'am.

151
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,560
DI Chung.

152
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,800
<i>Interesting place.
You live here?</i>

153
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,440
Yes. I'm a retired nurse.

154
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,040
Anyone else? My son.

155
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,480
Where is he? At work.

156
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,560
He's an engineer.

157
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,400
Find Lale.

158
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,720
<i>You find anything?
She's not there.</i>

159
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,400
<i>Let's scrub this down.
Everything. Yes, boss.</i>

160
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,120
This never happened.

161
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,440
<i>This is Asif. It
needs an answer.</i>

162
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,520
Yeah.

163
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,960
Yeah, it does.

164
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,600
Let me in on it, sort
things out, I can help.

165
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,000
Yeah, good.

166
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,000
Right, keep looking.

167
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,000
This is Asif, has to be.

168
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,760
And we need to make good
with him.

169
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,640
Asif attacking Lale
is an attack on us.

170
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,160
No. It's an attack on Lale.

171
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,960
You bet on the wrong dog, mate.

172
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,440
Now is not the time
for further risks.

173
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,979
You'll just be
throwing petrol on

174
00:20:09,003 --> 00:20:10,480
the fire - one we can't control.

175
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,446
How close are you to finding out

176
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,240
who stole the half a billion?

177
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,800
He knows.

178
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,600
Mosi is in London.

179
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,680
Half of the money was his.

180
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,960
He'll go after Luan first
but we should be ready.

181
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,440
Take the legs.

182
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,400
Come on, man, let's go. Yeah.

183
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,480
OK, one, two, in.

184
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,120
OK, come on, let's go.

185
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,280
Gentlemen.

186
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,320
My money is gone.

187
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,807
The Wallaces, Luan Dushaj and

188
00:20:57,831 --> 00:20:59,800
the bankers have stolen from me.

189
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,840
They are all thieves.

190
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,760
Zeus.

191
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,240
Enough.

192
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,040
There's no money here.

193
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,360
We're not a bank!

194
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,360
It's just numbers, you see.

195
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,120
Just numbers!

196
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,160
No! No!

197
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,160
<i>No! Please!
Please, please, please, no!</i>

198
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,560
No, no!

199
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,480
Dad.

200
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,800
Dad!

201
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,600
This is going to be chaos!

202
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,680
Please, it's her birthday today.

203
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,080
Come on, please!

204
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,680
Oh, thank you so much! Mwah!

205
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,440
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

206
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,560
This girl will be spoilt
by all of this.

207
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,880
Luan? It'll be OK.

208
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,800
I've brought a gift
for the birthday girl.

209
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,600
Something a little different.

210
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,720
<i>Good to see you, Mosi.
What are you doing here?</i>

211
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,400
You thought it would work?

212
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,160
Stealing from me?

213
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,609
Everything is fine, the money

214
00:25:03,633 --> 00:25:05,160
has gone through. Not my money.

215
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,840
You took it.

216
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,920
Mosi, please,
that's not possible.

217
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,320
You caught us out.

218
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,000
<i>Then it was a mistake.
That you stole from us, yes.</i>

219
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,560
No, no, no. Our deal is off.

220
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,800
We have been set up, man.

221
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,240
<i>Repay everything. Mosi,
this has to be the Wallaces.</i>

222
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,600
Or I butcher everyone
you hold precious.

223
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,760
Every single one of them.

224
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,280
<i>What's her name?
My name's Bukoroshe.</i>

225
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,360
<i>Ahh. Such a pretty
name. Bukoroshe?</i>

226
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,840
Bukoroshe.

227
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,200
Oh, a puppy!

228
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,560
I love him!

229
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,360
You made a mistake, man.

230
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,480
All of the money.

231
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,320
Where 11 employees from
the Adige Investment House

232
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,240
have been found with their
hands severed at the wrist.

233
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,720
In other news, the
controversial Belvedere Tower

234
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,960
will open today as planned -

235
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,080
You're a fucking liar, Ed.

236
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,480
Where's my money?

237
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,560
You said we had a deal.

238
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,640
I have to kill a
fucking family for this.

239
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,080
You understand?

240
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,600
I should put a fucking bullet
in your brain right now.

241
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,480
<i>It's not us, Luan.
We don't know where it is.</i>

242
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,040
What do you mean you
don't know? It's gone.

243
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,002
And whoever took
your money, took ours

244
00:28:07,026 --> 00:28:09,120
as well, so killing
me won't change that.

245
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,080
I'm out of fucking time, man.

246
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,840
Mosi won't wait any longer.

247
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,040
You have to help me, Ed.

248
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,520
Luan.

249
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,920
Mosi is your problem, not ours.

250
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,989
We are honouring your deal with

251
00:28:33,013 --> 00:28:35,000
Finn, not your deal with Mosi.

252
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,360
When we find out
who took our money,

253
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:39,600
we'll both claim
back what's ours.

254
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,360
Until then, we're
all on our own.

255
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,640
<i>So where are you taking us?
Somewhere close.</i>

256
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,640
<i>You'll like it.
It's really nice.</i>

257
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,120
Get in there.

258
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,280
Wow, cool! A motorbike!

259
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,040
Careful on this, please.

260
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,640
- All right, where we going?
- Italy.

261
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,920
Where in Italy?

262
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,320
Er, Rome.

263
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,000
Rome!

264
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,400
Are you gonna tell us
when we get there, yeah? Yep.

265
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,360
OK.

266
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,400
Er, Danny? Danny. Yeah?

267
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,480
Go and see how they're getting
on with our food. OK, Mum.

268
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,640
Good boy.

269
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,680
He's a good kid.

270
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,320
Are you all right?

271
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,720
If... if this all goes wrong...

272
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,720
<i>do you have a fire escape?
Why, what's happened?</i>

273
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,440
Earlier today, I had to help
get rid of a dozen bodies.

274
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,960
Hang on, was Dad or Alex
involved? No, none of us were.

275
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,360
OK.

276
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,520
After Finn's death,

277
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,360
the rivalry...

278
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,440
It's getting worse out there.

279
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,120
What is it?

280
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,240
That can't ever be you.

281
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,680
Well...

282
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,765
I've had a bag packed ever since

283
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:37,320
it went wrong with
Danny's father.

284
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,440
Passports, cash -
Danny and me, we're gone.

285
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,280
So what about YOUR fire escape?

286
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,640
Would you um...

287
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,640
Would you come with us?

288
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,920
And even if it
does go all wrong,

289
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,680
The Wallaces and Dumanis have
been through bad times before.

290
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,716
Dad's been worrying me actually.

291
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,680
He just seems so
lost without Finn.

292
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,080
Hey.

293
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,640
Come away from the window. What?

294
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,080
Come on.

295
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,400
Hey.

296
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,280
We got nothing from those
two addresses you gave me.

297
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,040
<i>No leads, no clues. That house
was packed with evidence.</i>

298
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,200
Yeah, by packed you mean
an empty garage

299
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,200
and a hungry eel then yeah,
you are right.

300
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,840
So they were expecting you -
which means you have a link.

301
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,160
Why the fuck have you got a UC
following me? What?

302
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,534
I should have known from
the beginning: The way he

303
00:31:55,558 --> 00:31:57,960
holds his gun, making
himself useful, just like me.

304
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,425
Who the fuck put him there? How

305
00:31:59,449 --> 00:32:00,760
do you know he's undercover?

306
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,369
He was taking pictures of me and

307
00:32:02,393 --> 00:32:03,840
Shannon. What are you saying?

308
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,126
Maybe he's connected
with whoever's cleaned those

309
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:08,600
houses before you raided
them. I need him pulled out.

310
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,160
I don't care who he works for.

311
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,160
I cannot operate
with him on my back.

312
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,960
He doesn't know
I know about him yet.

313
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,492
I'll set him up, you can arrest

314
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:16,840
him with a bunch of others-

315
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,520
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who do you think you are?</i>

316
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,040
That is way too high risk.

317
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,720
Me being under surveillance
is too high risk.

318
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,880
This is how UCs get killed.

319
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,120
Do it.

320
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,600
He's lost his mind.

321
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,000
He takes a bullet
for Sean Wallace,

322
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,058
then goes above and beyond and

323
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,320
sleeps with Ed
Dumani's daughter.

324
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,680
Let me level with him.

325
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,520
If I could work with him we
could do some serious damage.

326
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,945
And what if he chooses Shannon.

327
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:52,920
Dumani and her
son... instead of you?

328
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,360
I'm pulling him out.

329
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,800
It might take a little while
to set up.

330
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,096
You'll be briefed
on everything he

331
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,080
found out, and I'll keep you in.

332
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,200
If you're up for it.

333
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,600
Colin.

334
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,760
Been a while.

335
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,880
Typical warm Irish welcome.

336
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,560
I always knew
that someday you'd be back.

337
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,160
Despite the fact you set
me up on a one-way ticket?

338
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,800
I didn't set you up.

339
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,320
You didn't try and stop it.

340
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,160
They would've killed us both.

341
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,986
So best to have
your little sister

342
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,560
blown to pieces instead, hmm?

343
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,280
You deserved it.

344
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,800
All dead now, that crowd.

345
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,720
Who killed your man?

346
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,000
I'm still working on that.

347
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,200
And now you want
to give us a yacht?

348
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,960
What would we do with a yacht?

349
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,840
He paid 36 million for it.

350
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,120
<i>Sell it. You'll get at
least a third of that.</i>

351
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,200
I need your support.

352
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,120
I need your men.

353
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,040
What have you done, Marian?

354
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,000
Shit!

355
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,320
Everything all right, Colin?

356
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,880
Marian fucking Wallace
back from the dead.

357
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,870
You gave us up!

358
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,630
To Asif!

359
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,230
You gave us up!

360
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:33,470
No. No, no, no.

361
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:37,190
Then where was
the Wallace protection, huh?

362
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,390
Where?!

363
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,990
Where is it now?

364
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,590
How did you just get to me?

365
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,790
It's fucked is what it is.

366
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:52,790
All your people, I saw them.

367
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,830
I let you down.

368
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,870
And I'm truly sorry.

369
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:08,790
I can't go against
Asif right now.

370
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,790
There's too much happening.

371
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,590
But I will.

372
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,990
And soon.

373
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,350
I can't wait for 'soon'.

374
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:22,190
What do you want to do?

375
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,710
Take what he most cherishes.

376
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:37,590
Latest poll has you in the lead.

377
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:40,430
Tomorrow you will
sweep to victory.

378
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,296
These scumbag
journalists are calling

379
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,070
me 'The Galloping
Horse' candidate.

380
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:47,350
Good slogan! Backing you to win.

381
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:49,150
Horse is English
slang for heroin.

382
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,630
Yeah.

383
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:55,710
They are linking me
to my drug-dealing father.

384
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,470
An outrageous slur.

385
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,350
I am not a dealer!

386
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:02,830
And the attack on Lale?

387
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:05,350
That was your blunt hand, yes?

388
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,710
That was my strong hand!

389
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,150
You're gonna want to see this.

390
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,478
Shocked by the escalating

391
00:38:06,502 --> 00:38:08,390
violence on the
streets of London,

392
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:12,470
as highlighted by the 'Adige
Investment House Massacre' -

393
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,230
A police spokesman suggested
a connection

394
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,830
to a surge in violent
gangland crime

395
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:21,270
following the recent shooting
of businessman Finn Wallace,

396
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,750
who was patron
of the Wallace Foundation.

397
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,830
His body was -

398
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,956
They attacked
one the oldest, most

399
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,150
trusted investment
houses in the city.

400
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,967
Do you have any
understanding of what

401
00:38:34,991 --> 00:38:36,670
that will do for
business confidence?

402
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,030
Yeah, well,

403
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,870
maybe killing Finn Wallace
wasn't such a smart move.

404
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,794
Close of business
today, I want to

405
00:38:42,818 --> 00:38:44,670
know that your
son is in control.

406
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,590
Or none of you will be.

407
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,190
Alex?

408
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,670
It has to be Finn.

409
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,910
And it's not just Luan's money
that's gone -

410
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,933
there's three more
empty accounts.

411
00:39:12,957 --> 00:39:14,790
It's over a billion and a half.

412
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,590
It was Finn Wallace.

413
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,670
No question.

414
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:25,030
Alex, don't say anything
to anyone until I get there.

415
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,430
You found anything yet?

416
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,310
Oh, no, no, nothing yet.

417
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:41,630
I keep coming back
to Luan's photos.

418
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,070
Look.

419
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,670
That's the one I
keep looking at.

420
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,670
That's not who my father was.

421
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:58,390
Or he had an overwhelming
reason to do what he did.

422
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:02,310
He was protecting us from
something, something huge.

423
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,630
Dad's big weakness -

424
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:08,470
he could never confide in us
when things went bad.

425
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,990
You'd tell me, right?

426
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:17,030
Yeah.

427
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:21,030
Wallace and Dumani -
no-one can fuck us over.

428
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:46,430
I've got a job for you tomorrow.

429
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:48,477
We need some
guns picking up from

430
00:40:48,501 --> 00:40:50,470
a car park over in the East End.

431
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,270
Sean's orders?

432
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:54,550
The fuck are you
asking me questions for?

433
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,230
Mrs Wallace has brought back
own army with her.

434
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:08,390
I'll let Sean know.

435
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:17,870
Welcome back Mrs, Wallace.

436
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,470
Get them food.

437
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,030
Wait in there.

438
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,870
Who the fuck are you?

439
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,470
I work for Mrs Wallace.

440
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,590
Fuck's sake.

441
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,070
Who was that?

442
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:24,230
Who are those men
in the boardroom?

443
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:26,390
What the fuck have
you been doing?

444
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,910
Protecting you.

445
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:03,150
I've always known Ed was lying.

446
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:05,510
From the very beginning.

447
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:08,310
Remember, we
only just found out.

448
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:11,790
Do you think they'll listen
to reason?

449
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:14,350
Not a chance.

450
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:19,150
But there's only one way
out of this.

451
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:51,110
Grannie!

452
00:43:58,270 --> 00:43:59,990
I wasn't expecting Danny.

453
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:01,670
Oh, I though it was
a family meeting.

454
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:06,590
Hey!

455
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:14,927
I couldn't get a
sitter. Danny will

456
00:44:14,951 --> 00:44:17,110
be fine by himself
in another room.

457
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:22,870
<i>Sorry, what is the problem?
What's going on?</i>

458
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:34,710
Take Danny to the office
and stay with him.

459
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:37,190
<i>No, I want Elliot in the room.
Just families.</i>

460
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,350
OK.

461
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:42,990
Let's go, big man.

462
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:44,990
Hi.

463
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:50,910
Let's go!

464
00:44:57,350 --> 00:44:59,270
Dad. Hey.

465
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:02,710
Hi.

466
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:25,190
Elliot, come on!

467
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:27,710
Ssh, ssh, ssh.

468
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:31,310
You've got some
explaining to do.

469
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:34,510
How long have you known
about Floriana?

470
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:36,043
Alexander didn't know anything

471
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:37,630
I didn't ask about Alexander!

472
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:40,110
I'd known for a couple
of months. You lied to me.

473
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:42,990
You knew Finn was leaving us.

474
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:45,110
He only told me that
on the day he was killed.

475
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:47,007
You've known since
then? I kept it quiet

476
00:45:47,031 --> 00:45:48,910
for the sake of
keeping things together.

477
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:50,950
You kept it quiet
because you were in on it!

478
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:52,963
You two were
always gonna fucking

479
00:45:52,987 --> 00:45:54,630
take over. That's not true.

480
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:56,710
Oh, I'll get to you
in a minute! Sean.

481
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:59,150
I watched you fall to pieces
after Finn's death.

482
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,150
You needed to believe in him,
we all did

483
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:03,630
for the sake of the business
I kept back what I knew.

484
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:06,390
<i>To keep things straight.
Straight?!</i>

485
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,390
There's nothing's
straight about you.

486
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:11,288
<i>Look. You've been
tagged since day</i>

487
00:46:11,312 --> 00:46:14,110
one: At Jack's
flat, exact times.

488
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:18,550
<i>Arrives 7.40 - departs 9.10.
The night you killed him.</i>

489
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:21,710
Jack knew about Finn and
Floriana leaving together.

490
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:24,110
Again, for the
good of the family.

491
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:25,545
Your meetings with Jevan - were

492
00:46:25,569 --> 00:46:27,030
they for the good of the family?

493
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:29,950
Whoever tried to kill me made
sure you two went unharmed.

494
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:31,438
We didn't know that at the time.

495
00:46:31,462 --> 00:46:33,110
We've held back
on too much already.

496
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:34,578
We should have let them in on

497
00:46:34,602 --> 00:46:36,390
things way before
this. What things?

498
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:38,489
When we found out
who killed your father, that

499
00:46:38,513 --> 00:46:40,550
it was the same people
who tried to kill you.

500
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,590
It was our own investors!

501
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:45,070
OK. OK.

502
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:46,910
So why didn't you tell me?

503
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:50,190
Because, Sean, you were out of
control. Out of your control!

504
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:08,030
What I said at Finn's funeral
about a good man,

505
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,910
those words were
true to me then.

506
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:13,110
Even though I knew he wanted
a second chance at life,

507
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:16,550
some old man's fantasy,
with some pretty girl,

508
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:18,270
but he was still my friend.

509
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:20,270
Until we found out
what he'd really done.

510
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:26,870
Look, we both knew that
Finn had Luan kill this boy

511
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:28,757
along with his family. What we

512
00:47:28,781 --> 00:47:30,830
didn't know until
today, was why.

513
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:35,030
Finn had created a
parallel business for himself.

514
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:37,230
It wasn't sustainable.

515
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:39,233
He robs new
investors to pay off the

516
00:47:39,257 --> 00:47:41,350
old ones, including
this boy's father.

517
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:44,110
He stole from him to pay
off an increasing deficit

518
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:45,755
but he had no
intention of paying

519
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:47,310
him back, so he had him killed.

520
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:49,390
Him and his entire family.

521
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:51,510
But it still wasn't enough,

522
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:54,350
so he stole the half billion
from Luan and the Nigerians.

523
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:57,230
I saw that money disappear in
front of my eyes. We both did.

524
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:59,230
A couple of timed
bank transfers,

525
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:01,390
triggered a week after
he would have left.

526
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:02,994
By the time he
planned to vanish,

527
00:48:03,018 --> 00:48:04,790
he'd taken over a
billion and a half.

528
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:08,790
And he took it from each
and every one in this room.

529
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:11,590
OK, OK, OK. So...

530
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:15,990
If it's true, you knew today
when I asked you.

531
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:18,224
Honestly, I'd only
just found out.

532
00:48:18,248 --> 00:48:20,590
I couldn't find the
words to say it,

533
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:22,167
I didn't want it to be true. No,

534
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:23,750
it's because it's a fucking lie!

535
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:25,510
You know how much
you mean to - Shut up!

536
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:27,230
Oh, fuck off! Shannon!

537
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:33,590
Your meeting with Jevan
today - what was that about?

538
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:47,550
Our investors killed Finn
because he was leaving.

539
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:52,150
They are prepared
to let the business continue

540
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:56,830
on condition that Alexander
runs the Wallace Organisation.

541
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:03,350
And Sean?

542
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:05,510
What did you decide for Sean?

543
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:09,990
They don't want Sean
anywhere near it.

544
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:15,150
And neither did Finn.

545
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:21,150
<i>Calm down!
It's all right, calm down!</i>

546
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:22,870
Hey hey hey hey hey!

547
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:24,510
Danny!

548
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:26,750
He was always jealous
of my father. But you?!

549
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:29,150
You fucking Judas cunt!

550
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:31,670
If I ever see you again
I'll kill you!

551
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:33,350
Now take your
scumbag father away.

552
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:35,750
Elliot!

553
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:39,350
<i>They clear up their own mess.
Get out of my fucking house!</i>

554
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:41,910
Argh!

555
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:57,390
I don't want you going near
Shannon Dumani ever again.

556
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:00,830
Understood?

557
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:07,230
Understood.

558
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:11,630
It's you and me now.

559
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:17,510
They'll come after you.

560
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:20,830
You can't stay here.

561
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,310
OK, OK.

562
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:16,150
You're OK.

563
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:21,990
It's OK, it'll be OK.

564
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:24,950
It's all right.

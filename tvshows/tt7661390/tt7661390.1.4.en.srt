1
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,260
Luan knows there's a
conversation. Sean...

2
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,380
He knows what my dad was doing
that night on HIS territory.

3
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,340
Your husband was one hell
of a squirrel, Mrs Wallace.

4
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,500
<i>Tell me about her - Floriana.
She's going to have his baby.</i>

5
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,980
<i>Finn kept his contacts hidden.
I can make introductions.</i>

6
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,176
Ed, you know a great deal more

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,660
than you're telling
any one of us.

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,860
<i>I'm married.
Then take me home, then.</i>

9
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,020
My grandson had a lot
of questions about you.

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,780
I didn't know what to tell him.

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,860
Don't ever go against me again.

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,660
At the hint

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,980
of anyone else in danger,
you stop it.

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,380
<i>What's happened?
Your son's what's happened!</i>

15
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,060
To my family...

16
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,780
To my beautiful family!

17
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,140
We fucking did it, boyo!

18
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,460
Ah, my beautiful boys.

19
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,820
Sean!

20
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,860
Come in here, Sean, ya bollocks.

21
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,900
You see that, eh?

22
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,940
Alex came good.

23
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,220
Ten billion dirty yen

24
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,860
vanished - pff!-

25
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,500
into cement and glass.

26
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,300
That's what
success looks like for us now.

27
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,380
Invisible.

28
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,420
And YOU. What?

29
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,540
You said we couldn't do it...

30
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,340
<i>Come on. "Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Denied your own son!</i>

31
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,740
<i>OK, so you proved me wrong.
Well, we did it.</i>

32
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,700
Thanks, Finn,

33
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,660
for everything.

34
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,820
You know, for believing in me.

35
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,540
The geeks shall
inherit the earth.

36
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,152
You keep bringing
me the numbers,

37
00:02:16,176 --> 00:02:17,900
I'll keep turning
them into stone.

38
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,620
You do your job well, son.

39
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,340
What are you going to do
when I'm not here?

40
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,300
What do you mean?

41
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,340
When I die, Sean.

42
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,900
Alex has taken
us to a new level.

43
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,060
You have to deliver.

44
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,180
I will. Mm...

45
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,220
You're a Wallace.

46
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,460
A Wallace!

47
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,300
Everything hangs upon our name.

48
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,540
You understand?

49
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,220
Yeah. Yeah.

50
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,780
Don't fucking "yeah" me.

51
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,260
Do you understand?

52
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,020
Yes, Dad. Yes. Yes, Finn.

53
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,420
Good. Good.

54
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,860
Because... when you're on top,

55
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,420
there's always someone
looking to take you down.

56
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,460
Who's gonna touch us, eh?

57
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,340
That's my boy.

58
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,780
<i>Ah, Billy!
What's the celebration?</i>

59
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,020
Happy families? To my family...

60
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,340
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

61
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,380
Cheers.

62
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,580
Guess what I'm gonna play?

63
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,060
You see, Seany boy,
we're all family.

64
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,380
That's what keeps us strong.

65
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,540
Always keep your family close,

66
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,580
and everything
will work out fine.

67
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,900
Fuck off!

68
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,980
<i>I said, fuck off!
Get the fuck out!</i>

69
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,820
Get the fuck back!

70
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,700
Move!

71
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,140
<i>Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out!</i>

72
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,500
Agh! Fuck off!

73
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,020
Move, move!

74
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,620
Fuck!

75
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,140
Move!

76
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,180
Let me give you
a little topping up...

77
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,460
<i>Ah, that was intense!
You lot are jokers, man.</i>

78
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,780
<i>Grab an umbrella, Anthony.
You're gonna need it.</i>

79
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,380
Hey, stop fucking around, man.

80
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,140
Ah! Thank you, Jesus!

81
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,180
<i>Shut the blasted door!
This place stinks, man.</i>

82
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,580
Raheem, tell your uncle
to clean this place up!

83
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,660
Hey, shut up, man!

84
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,380
Uncle! Don't "uncle" me.

85
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,580
Who is he? That's Tony.

86
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,420
Helped us out on a job.

87
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,340
<i>What job? I didn't
give you any job.</i>

88
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,860
<i>The Royal Arcade.
We hit it this morning, innit?</i>

89
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,540
That place is Wallace
protected, man!

90
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,220
Calm down, man.

91
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,380
<i>Their boss is done.
No-one's watching.</i>

92
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,580
Sean Wallace got
eyes everywhere.

93
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,020
And just for the record...

94
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,460
he's a fucking psychopath.

95
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,300
Just tell us
if you can shift it or not.

96
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,900
You know he shot up
the traveller site.

97
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,180
Murdered more than 20 gypsies
just to send a message.

98
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,220
Sean Wallace?

99
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,500
Raheem, what the fuck
are we gonna do, man?

100
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,340
We need to fix this.

101
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,780
You get this out of my house

102
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,860
right now!

103
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,900
N-O - fucking W - now!

104
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,580
Come on, let's go.

105
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,300
What happened last night?

106
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,140
I told you
I was gonna take care of Lale.

107
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,500
<i>I had a plan. Which you
failed to share with me.</i>

108
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,660
I cannot be on the
back foot here, Sean.

109
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,260
We have enough enemies
as it is. Then trust me.

110
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,100
If you and Elliot
hadn't intervened,

111
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,500
we wouldn't be wiping
Cole's brains off the floor.

112
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,540
This is not
how your father and I worked.

113
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,580
We communicated.

114
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,220
One of our jewellery shops
was robbed this morning.

115
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,860
<i>We're losing respect.
People are watching us.</i>

116
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,780
Here.

117
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,420
This is where we must be strong.

118
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,540
What was Elliot
doing there last night?

119
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,940
I didn't send him. I don't know.

120
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,100
I didn't order him either.

121
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,860
But I do want to find out
exactly who or what he is.

122
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,220
Look, I want us
to be strong again.

123
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,260
Bring Alex to the house tonight.

124
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,380
<i>We'll have dinner.
The whole family.</i>

125
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,180
Thanks, son.

126
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,420
Doors closing.

127
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,580
Morning, sunshine.

128
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,620
Geez!

129
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,380
Come on.

130
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,620
Knee popped again.

131
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,660
Really?

132
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,140
How's work?

133
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,180
Yeah, fine.

134
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,220
It's busy.

135
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,900
Sorry I haven't been
around much lately.

136
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,180
I got Sally to take me
to the cemetery yesterday.

137
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,580
Yeah. Well...

138
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,900
tell her

139
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,940
thank you...

140
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,420
from me.

141
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,460
Come here.

142
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,380
What kind of trouble are you in?

143
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,340
Is this work now?

144
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,820
No. Dad, really...

145
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,860
it's fine.

146
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,380
If you knew what I was doing,
you'd be proud of me.

147
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,780
Elliot...

148
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,820
I AM proud of you.

149
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,620
They were an Albanian family.

150
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,060
The whole bloodline
wiped out in Albania.

151
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,180
Which one did Finn want dead?

152
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,460
Probably not the 12-year-old.

153
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,820
<i>This isn't Finn.
Luan brought you this?</i>

154
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,500
Finn gave him a free pass
on some washing to do the hit.

155
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,500
Half a billion pounds worth.

156
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,780
That much money,
I'd have seen it in the books.

157
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,540
<i>Finn must have bypassed you.
He bypassed us both.</i>

158
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,020
<i>No, Luan's lying.
This isn't how Finn operated.</i>

159
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,260
<i>Tell him to go...
A fortnight ago, yes.</i>

160
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,740
But something
got Finn shot in the head.

161
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,300
<i>I'll look for the money.
Then we pass judgment.</i>

162
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,180
Let me talk to Sean.

163
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,500
<i>No, not yet.
What do you mean, not yet.</i>

164
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,220
Because I need to think,

165
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,300
and I cannot do that with Sean
using psychopaths like Cole.

166
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,100
It's chaos.

167
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,900
Sean walked into chaos.

168
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,860
How can he take over and
act like everything's fine?

169
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,860
I just wish
the boy would listen to me.

170
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,608
Finn brought order to this city,

171
00:10:30,632 --> 00:10:32,100
and Sean's destroying that.

172
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,460
<i>Believe me, Alex.
They tie one body to us,</i>

173
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,980
and it's not just us exposed -
it's everybody.

174
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,020
You know Sean loves you.

175
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,620
That's what this whole
dinner tonight's about.

176
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,660
Yeah, I know.

177
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,660
And I wouldn't be
honouring Finn's memory

178
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,380
if I didn't at least
try to keep his son in check.

179
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,300
Jevan's invited
us to meet some...

180
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,700
friends of Finn's tonight.

181
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,540
Friends?

182
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,340
What about Sean?

183
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,460
We'll be back in time
for his dinner.

184
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,460
You think you can fill it?

185
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,620
Open the docks,

186
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,780
no problem. Good.

187
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,300
We're going to make
a lot of money together.

188
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,940
<i>Why? Why do you want
to go into business with me?</i>

189
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,540
I've seen what
you're willing to sacrifice.

190
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,980
You know what they say
about my enemy's enemy?

191
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,660
So this is about Asif?

192
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,580
The entire old order.

193
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,940
I work with who I can trust now.

194
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,980
If people get angry, so be it.

195
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,740
Your boyfriend doesn't like me.

196
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,540
My people...

197
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,580
they die for me,

198
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,900
and if I tell them
they die for you too.

199
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,380
Whatever Asif throws at us...

200
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,100
It won't come to that.

201
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,764
Nasir's in the public eye. His

202
00:12:33,788 --> 00:12:35,540
father won't risk the attention.

203
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,300
And Luan?

204
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,060
Have you looked him in the eye?

205
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,100
Not yet.

206
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,460
Tax haven, housing hell!

207
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,420
<i>Tax haven, housing hell!
Tax haven, housing hell!</i>

208
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,780
The trickle-down effect
has been a lie

209
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,780
and I am here to tackle
that deceit from the inside.

210
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,540
Pause. Let it land.

211
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,540
Every empty home
chips away at our city's soul.

212
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,820
This city is more
than just a destination.

213
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,860
London is a home.

214
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:04,500
The time has come to end the
exploitation of OUR capital

215
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,740
by rich foreign investors.

216
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
And to those developers

217
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,820
with towers that lay empty,

218
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,680
facilitating the criminalisation

219
00:14:13,704 --> 00:14:14,820
of London property,

220
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,100
I am here to tell you...

221
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,140
the ride is over.

222
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,140
My office is coming for you.

223
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,060
All right, sis?

224
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,100
Hi. Wait! Norovirus on the ward.

225
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,100
I don't get sick.

226
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,940
You know it's my super power.

227
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,660
You get my message
about tonight?

228
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,660
Yeah. I assumed it was a joke.

229
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,060
<i>Sunday roast at Mum's house.
It's Wednesday.</i>

230
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,060
<i>Wednesday roast, then.
Who gives a shit?</i>

231
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,260
Family dinner -
the Wallaces and the Dumanis.

232
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,020
Ooh. No, thank you.

233
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,820
You can't sacrifice two
hours of your night for me?

234
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,220
For you and Billy, yes.

235
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,940
Not her.

236
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,220
No Mum - no me.

237
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,420
I don't negotiate
with blackmailers.

238
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,060
What about the
bump? You gonna deny

239
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,660
it the chance to
meet Uncle Seany?

240
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,700
Learn the ways of the world?

241
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,300
Look, I'm working, Sean.

242
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,100
You're a tonic, Jacq.

243
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,140
I need you there.

244
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,700
Fine.

245
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,447
Just to be clear,
this baby will not

246
00:15:41,471 --> 00:15:43,060
be learning the
ways of the world

247
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,020
from his Uncle Seany.

248
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,660
<i>What have we got?
We've got low blood pressure</i>

249
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,540
and he's been fitting...

250
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,340
Anything else?

251
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,980
Hey. What are you doing here?

252
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,740
Er...

253
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,060
<i>I just wanted to talk...
about the other night.</i>

254
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,580
<i>Yeah, well, nothing happened.
Yeah, I know, but...</i>

255
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,580
I've got to go to work, Elliot.

256
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,420
It's two years.

257
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,900
It's two years
since my wife and child died.

258
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,500
Her name was...

259
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,540
Naomi.

260
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,700
And his was Samuel.

261
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,940
They...

262
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,980
There was a car accident.

263
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,420
<i>And... It's all right.
You don't have to.</i>

264
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,220
I want to. I know, but you...

265
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,260
you can't.

266
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,540
I lost my mum.

267
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,540
It takes more than
just the passing of time

268
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,580
to put yourself back together.

269
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,060
They keep going, you know?

270
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,100
Those relationships.

271
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,940
It's almost like you get a
second chance in a way.

272
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,100
So what do you
wanna talk about, then?

273
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,140
I don't know, erm...

274
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,020
happy things. Happy things, OK.

275
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,060
What about...

276
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,100
balloons?

277
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,460
Balloons?!

278
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,500
Balloons and sunsets.

279
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,220
Ooh, sunsets, very cliche.

280
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,940
What about Paris?

281
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,860
Prefer Rome.

282
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,620
Too many churches.

283
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,100
I like your eyes.

284
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,980
Do you think this
is a good idea?

285
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,980
No.

286
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,940
Do you?

287
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,100
Mum? I...

288
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,260
I missed the minibus.

289
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,220
<i>Hi, Elliot.
Hey, bud. How are you doing?</i>

290
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,220
Can you walk me? Danny!

291
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,940
It's all right.

292
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,660
Yeah, I'll take him.

293
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,700
So why didn't you want
to go to school today?

294
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,900
There's football trials today.

295
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,460
That's great, isn't it? Er, no.

296
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
Why not? I'm shit at it.

297
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,620
Is there anyone in your class
that's not as good as you?

298
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,020
Mr Jenkins says
Lewis is "effing useless".

299
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,700
<i>Right.
Only he didn't say "effing".</i>

300
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,460
Right, OK, I've got it.

301
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,980
Every time Lewis gets the
ball, you snatch it off him,

302
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,820
make him look like
an absolute mug.

303
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,460
You take it off him and take
him out every chance you get.

304
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
Got it? Got it.

305
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,220
If I get into the team,

306
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,260
will you come and watch us?

307
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,700
Well, let's ask your mum
first, see what she says.

308
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,060
All right? All right, Elliot.

309
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,100
Have a good day.

310
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,540
Bye, Dad!

311
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,580
Love you!

312
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,287
He had his problems
with authority,

313
00:19:42,311 --> 00:19:44,380
but he's a good
lad. Good soldier.

314
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,060
Dad? Stuck by his mates.

315
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,817
Hope you're not boring Sally

316
00:19:47,841 --> 00:19:49,820
with war stories again, are you?

317
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,860
Hello, Elliot. How are you?

318
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,900
Good to see you've recovered.

319
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,220
I didn't know you
were coming over.

320
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:02,460
Well, it turns out
we have friends in common.

321
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,940
Your father used to work
for the Williams brothers.

322
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,820
Me and Elliot moved
around a lot. That's right.

323
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,740
As you said, Charlie.

324
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,300
And you don't share
the same surname

325
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,420
because Elliot
here is a bastard...

326
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,900
<i>and he took his mum's instead.
Is that right?</i>

327
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,260
Yeah.

328
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,860
You know, I had the
pleasure and privilege

329
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,820
of seeing your
father in the ring.

330
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,140
<i>He had quite a punch on him.
A good one.</i>

331
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:36,220
But he was better
at losing, though.

332
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,420
Anyway...

333
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,820
Thanks for the conversation,
Charlie.

334
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,406
If you will excuse us, I just

335
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,260
need to have a
word with your son.

336
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,620
Stay here.

337
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,130
I don't kill kids.

338
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,850
I took Cole to that flat.

339
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,490
If anything had happened to
them, it would've been on ME.

340
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,290
Don't take matters into your
own hands. Do as you're told.

341
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,130
Sean told me... Sean nothing.

342
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,930
You're my concern now.

343
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,970
There's a jeweller's
we look after.

344
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,170
Some crew were stupid enough
to knock it over.

345
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,747
Mark will take you
where you need to

346
00:21:16,771 --> 00:21:18,330
go and tell you
what you need to do.

347
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,570
We don't want your conscience,
Elliot.

348
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,436
We need to know you're on side,

349
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,250
and I'm not convinced you are.

350
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,970
You do what Mark says,
to whomever he says to do it.

351
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,770
You understand?

352
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,010
And I will pay your father
another visit

353
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,330
if I don't like
what he has to report back.

354
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,850
Let's go.

355
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,410
Let's see what you're made of,
shall we?

356
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:55,530
Lads tend to go one way or the
other after a tour of Afghan.

357
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,010
Buck the system
or go further in.

358
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,570
Nocturne In E-flat
Major, Opus 9, Number 2.

359
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,330
Mrs Wallace,

360
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:43,250
it's so lovely to
see you here again.

361
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,010
It's been some time.

362
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,050
Tell me about Floriana.

363
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,370
I don't recall a...

364
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,410
My dead husband's mistress.

365
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:59,610
She was... quiet.

366
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,810
In her 20s.

367
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,850
Eastern European, I think.

368
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,850
Pot of tea, please.

369
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,010
Hey.

370
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,050
Good thing I like a challenge.

371
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,970
These are his movements
since Finn died.

372
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:34,210
He's been a very busy boy.

373
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,850
Mum...

374
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,890
Mum...

375
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,530
I miss him too.

376
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,610
That's the yacht
he bought for his mistress.

377
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:30,490
Even named it after her.

378
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,250
She must have
been pretty special.

379
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,970
Stop it! Sean, listen...

380
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,690
No, no, no, Mum. Not tonight.

381
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,730
Sean... No, Mum!

382
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,449
Pick out a nice
dress. We're going

383
00:25:42,473 --> 00:25:44,050
to have some fun this evening.

384
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,970
We're celebrating who we are,

385
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:48,010
what we have.

386
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,130
I know how I've
been running things

387
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,930
isn't exactly
how Uncle Ed would want,

388
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:01,010
but if I involve him more,

389
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,050
maybe he can see
it through my eyes.

390
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,810
It's OK.

391
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:13,410
We just need
to keep the family close,

392
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,650
and everything will
work out fine, Mum.

393
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,290
Barkley!

394
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,130
Still doping these pigeons?

395
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:40,050
Performance enhancing.

396
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:44,090
Very fine margins in racing
these days.

397
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,210
Which one of your crews did it?

398
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,050
Did what?

399
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,970
Jeweller's in Royal Arcade.

400
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,730
Nothing to do with me, I swear.

401
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,610
Nothing to do with me.

402
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,450
Elliot.

403
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,490
Fuck him up.

404
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,530
You gonna hurt me?

405
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,330
Let me tell you something, son.

406
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:06,970
They ain't got no new pain you
could inflict on this body.

407
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,410
What are you doing? Wait, man.

408
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,450
Hold on!

409
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,650
Fuck me! What the fuck!

410
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,410
How about a heads-up next time?

411
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,770
Now, you were asked a question.

412
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,610
Fuck you.

413
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,370
Sure.

414
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,130
Wait, man, wait, wait!

415
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:45,050
<i>Heads up, Kev!
Wait! Wait! Hold on.</i>

416
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:47,770
Wait. Wait.

417
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:50,010
Fucking pigeons!

418
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:53,050
Take us to your nephew if you
want to fucking breathe again.

419
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,050
Not here.

420
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,010
No-one sits here tonight.

421
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,050
Of course, Mr Wallace.

422
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:15,650
I shouldn't have said
anything. It doesn't matter.

423
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,810
You look great.

424
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,970
Wine? Lovely.

425
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,010
Red, please.

426
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,690
Shazza!

427
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,210
Danny boy!

428
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,890
Whoa! Hey!

429
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:31,890
Granny Marian! Oooh!

430
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,010
Marian, how are you?

431
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,330
<i>Yes, darling. Never better.
Good.</i>

432
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,490
I'm gonna put this over there.

433
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,370
There you go, Mum. Thank you.

434
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:44,050
Hello. Hello.

435
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,770
<i>Nice to see you.
Nice to see you too.</i>

436
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:46,950
Yeah, so Dad and Alex said

437
00:28:46,974 --> 00:28:48,450
they're gonna be a little late.

438
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,570
They've got some event,
but didn't say what.

439
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:53,530
<i>Really? Where? I don't know,
but they told me to tell you</i>

440
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:56,170
to lay off their Yorkshire
puds. We're having Italian.

441
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,490
<i>Ooh, so pizza, then?
You want wine? Yes, please.</i>

442
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,010
Billy. Hey, come through.

443
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:03,530
There you are. Thank you.

444
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,930
Hello. Hi.

445
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,970
Mwah.

446
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:15,130
Dad would have loved this.

447
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,330
Cheers.

448
00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:00,530
Alexander...

449
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:01,690
Ed...

450
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,370
very, very glad
you could make it.

451
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:05,370
Hello, Jevan. Jevan.

452
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,410
After you.

453
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,250
Let me introduce you to Natalie.

454
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,530
Mr Dumani...

455
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,770
I enjoyed your
interview in the FT.

456
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:20,490
There are lots of people here
excited to meet you.

457
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,730
Great.

458
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,770
Yeah, thanks,
Natalie. Thank you.

459
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,650
Walk with me.

460
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,970
Cheers. Cheers.

461
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,530
Ed.

462
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,570
<i>Come. Let me show
you the grounds.</i>

463
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,810
Who are these people?

464
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:18,610
These are your new friends, Ed.

465
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:23,130
They're representatives of

466
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:26,090
some of the wealthiest and
most powerful people on earth.

467
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:28,250
And they're all here
to meet your son.

468
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:33,730
The thing is, as long as
their money can't be traced,

469
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:36,290
they're untouchable.

470
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,307
And of course
London is where they

471
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,330
come to make
their sins disappear.

472
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:43,730
A multitude, I don't doubt.

473
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:46,850
Alex had found a way of doing
it with incredible returns.

474
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:49,970
Well, Sean is in charge now.

475
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,010
We've noticed.

476
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,693
But it's your son who needs to

477
00:32:53,717 --> 00:32:55,650
finish what he's
started with Finn.

478
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:59,130
There's people
relying on him, Ed.

479
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:02,090
Many people.

480
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:39,770
Floriana!

481
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:11,730
'Please leave a message
after the tone.'

482
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,970
Elliot.

483
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,730
Floriana was last seen

484
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:18,570
getting into a taxi
the day Finn Wallace was shot.

485
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,521
We need to know
who it's licensed

486
00:35:21,545 --> 00:35:23,330
to and find out
who the driver is.

487
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,370
Here's your food.

488
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,590
Floriana.

489
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,390
I don't want any.

490
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,430
You have to eat.

491
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,470
For the baby.

492
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,430
I need a fork.

493
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:07,190
<i>Leif. Your dinner
is getting cold.</i>

494
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,470
Leif! Coming, Mother.

495
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,330
Yeah, I understand that,
I understand that.

496
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,050
All I'm saying is
just have a look.

497
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:53,250
No-one's touching it. Fuck!

498
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:56,330
<i>Call your Manchester guy.
Word's spread. He said no.</i>

499
00:36:56,370 --> 00:37:00,290
<i>Look, we drop the price.
We fucking dump it.</i>

500
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:02,010
You what?

501
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,050
I have kids.

502
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:08,210
She's right, let's get
the fuck out of here.

503
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,690
Uncle.

504
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:24,210
Tell me some good news.

505
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,850
Raheem...

506
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:39,050
No-one move! Ah-ah-ah...

507
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,730
Back off. Way off.

508
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:54,810
You must be
Barkley's idiot nephew.

509
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,250
Right. Line up.

510
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,530
Look, we're really sorry.

511
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,050
It's all there, just take it.

512
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:06,090
Drop to your knees.

513
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:10,810
NOW!

514
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:14,410
<i>Right, Elliot.
Remember what Ed said.</i>

515
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:18,250
You do as I say when I say it.

516
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,690
Is there a problem?

517
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,770
No.

518
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:28,810
<i>Good. Cos it's
you and your dad on the line.</i>

519
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:30,650
So get ready, champ.

520
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:33,010
Let's see if you're any better
than your old man.

521
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:35,610
Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop!

522
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,850
Arms by your side, good lad.

523
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,890
You're a fucking punchbag now.

524
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:45,450
Ding ding. Round one.

525
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:59,610
Leave him alone!

526
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:01,890
Just take the jewellery!

527
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:04,810
Fuck me, put some
weight behind it, would ya?

528
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:20,850
Ooh, there we go.

529
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,250
There he is, look.

530
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,890
Right, let's do this
properly, shall we?

531
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:40,050
<i>Get off me, man!
Please. Get off!</i>

532
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,650
Stop! Knee.

533
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,690
Stop!

534
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,930
Don't you... Don't! Don't!

535
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,584
Would you rather
me go for another

536
00:39:51,608 --> 00:39:53,010
cup of tea with your old man?

537
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:56,890
Get off! Please!

538
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:59,170
Please. Please, don't.

539
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:00,734
I beg you, I'm begging you,

540
00:40:00,758 --> 00:40:02,690
<i>please. Think of
your dad, Elliot.</i>

541
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,610
Stop!

542
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:07,010
Please, please, please.

543
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:09,050
No, no, no! No...

544
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,210
Don't do it.

545
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,250
If not...

546
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:17,490
Come on... Come on!

547
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:20,170
Argh! Aargh! Aarghh!

548
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:23,090
Argghh...

549
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,890
Two rounds to go.

550
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,810
I... er...

551
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,290
I don't think we should
tell Sean about tonight.

552
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:46,090
Agreed.

553
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:58,610
You lost your appetite?

554
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:00,650
Too much wine.

555
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:11,650
They do say
half a glass doesn't hurt.

556
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:13,330
It's for Shannon.

557
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:16,530
But thanks for the
motherly advice.

558
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:21,970
You don't have to do
this alone, Jacqueline.

559
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:24,450
<i>I would love to help.
I'm not alone.</i>

560
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,570
I have friends and support.

561
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,730
My child might have
a chance at not turning out

562
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:30,570
a heroin addict or a thug.

563
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:34,970
You really do blame me
for everything, don't you?

564
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:37,770
- You were there.
- Cheers.

565
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:39,810
Bill...

566
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:44,970
Your father taught them
how to survive in this life.

567
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:51,690
This is who we are.

568
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:54,450
NOT me.

569
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,490
Yes, you.

570
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:59,370
You are who you are

571
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:02,090
because I shielded
you from your father.

572
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:07,410
I made a promise with myself...

573
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:10,810
to bring up a
daughter so good...

574
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:13,930
that she would turn her back
on her own family.

575
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:21,810
I just never
thought it would hurt so much.

576
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:54,410
Thank you.

577
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:01,490
Hello. It's about time we spoke.

578
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:04,330
Sean, listen carefully.

579
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:08,210
It appears Ed has
not spoken to you

580
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,370
about the deal
I made with your father.

581
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:13,330
Come to my office,
and we can discuss.

582
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:20,010
Grahams.

583
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:23,450
Call everyone in.

584
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:27,850
<i>Can I offer you a drink?
No, just get out of my way.</i>

585
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:07,730
<i>We've learnt our lesson.
Please just leave her alone.</i>

586
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,130
<i>Ding, ding, round three.
No, no, no, please.</i>

587
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:12,850
Actually, let's take the
hammer away, yeah.

588
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:19,410
Break her arm.

589
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:22,530
No, don't do this.

590
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:24,570
It's hers or your dad's, Elliot.

591
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:26,570
Yeah.

592
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:28,530
Get the fuck away from her!

593
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:30,410
<i>Go on, go on, break mine!
Break mine!</i>

594
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:32,210
Go on. Break it.

595
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:34,810
Go on. His first. Hers second.

596
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,850
No.

597
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:51,410
I won't do it.

598
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:04,170
<i>Call in from the boss.
We've got to go.</i>

599
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:06,970
Right now.

600
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:12,970
Mark, he sounded pissed off.

601
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:16,130
Follow me.

602
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:40,170
I fucking knew it
the moment I laid eyes on you.

603
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:41,650
Mark, what the fuck?

604
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:44,410
There's more than just a
fucking squaddie in there.

605
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,250
You're a fucking
cop, aren't you?

606
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:48,290
What the fuck are
you talking about?

607
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:54,890
<i>Move. Let's see what
Sean makes of you.</i>

608
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:03,290
Hands out.

609
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:20,290
(DISTANT SIREN WAILS

610
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:46,610
Sit tight, dickhead.

611
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:48,330
What about the old man?

612
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:50,370
Fuck him.

613
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:03,290
What took you so long?

614
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:08,210
<i>Elliot. He's...
Thank you for coming...</i>

615
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:10,250
Sean.

616
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:24,730
Don't thank me yet.

617
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:26,770
You may regret the invite.

618
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:46,690
You pulled me away
from my family dinner.

619
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:48,890
So tell me.

620
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:50,930
What did you do for my father?

621
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:54,810
Your father had me kill

622
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,850
a lot of people.

623
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:01,250
And now you...

624
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:03,290
owe me a lot of money.

625
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:11,690
Finn had a plan.

626
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:13,730
He...

627
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:15,770
Sean...

628
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:19,170
Sean, get down!

629
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,010
Jesus Christ!

630
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:47,370
Sean, get down!

631
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:14,130
I saw him!

632
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,930
Sean, get down!

633
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:21,930
Sean, stay down!

634
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:41,690
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

635
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:43,730
<i>You're all right.
It's not yours.</i>

636
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:53,010
Wait!

637
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:05,450
This way. This way, man!

638
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:07,490
Go, go, now go!

639
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:11,410
Yeah, I did.

640
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:29,890
Get up! Come on!

641
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:36,730
Get him up!

642
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:38,770
Who the fuck are you?

643
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:42,850
Let's get to that car!

644
00:51:56,770 --> 00:51:58,210
Go!

645
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:09,730
Move! Move!

646
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:11,410
Fucking drive!

647
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:13,090
Come on, it's OK.

648
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:26,930
Do a left up here,
yeah, yeah, yeah!

649
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:29,690
Come on, that's it,
stay with us, stay with us.

650
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,450
Just straight down,
under the bridge.

651
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:34,410
Come on, that's
it, stay with us.

652
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:36,210
Come on, faster!

653
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:38,690
Do a right, after the shop.

654
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:42,650
Elliot, Elliot, come on,
wake up, stay with me.

655
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:44,690
Hurry up!

656
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:49,210
Is it a boy baby or a girl one?

657
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:55,330
It's a girl.

658
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:00,370
Open the front door!

659
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:04,690
<i>Clear the table!
Jesus, Sean, for God's sake!</i>

660
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:06,450
Oh, my God, get in!

661
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:09,210
Sean, what the hell has
happened to you? Oh, my God...

662
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:11,890
<i>Sean! It's OK, Mum.
It's not my blood!</i>

663
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:14,010
It's OK.

664
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:16,050
Help, help!

665
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:20,370
What happened?

666
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:22,850
Just get outside,
man the front door.

667
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:26,930
Shh!

668
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:29,250
All right, all right,
let me have a look.

669
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:32,970
It's all right...

670
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:35,010
Jacq? OK, OK, OK...

671
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:37,610
I need... towels, towels.

672
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:39,650
Towels, Mum.

673
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:41,690
No... What?

674
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:43,450
Mum! Towels!

675
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:46,130
Towels, Mum! Ah! Got some.

676
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:48,010
Jacqueline, here.

677
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:50,010
<i>Stay with me, yeah?
Just stay with me.</i>

678
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:52,050
Hold him.

679
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:54,090
Hold his head!

680
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:56,410
Stay still.

681
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:58,250
All right...

682
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:00,650
I'm going to need a knife
or some kind of pliers.

683
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:02,370
Sean, hold him.

684
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:04,130
Sean, come!

685
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:05,850
Give him something
to bite down on.

686
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:07,890
Open your mouth.

687
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:09,930
Argh! Argh! Aargh!

688
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:12,930
Don't you dare leave me!

689
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:14,970
Shannon, hold them steady!

690
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:17,850
All right...

691
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:19,890
Have the towels ready.

692
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:27,810
It's OK.

693
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:29,570
OK, Elliot, I've got it.

694
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:33,530
That's it.

695
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:36,210
<i>Put pressure on it.
The towels, Sean!</i>

696
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:41,490
It's OK, that's it. That's it.

697
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:44,330
Elliot... Oh, my God!

698
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:46,730
No, no!

699
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:48,770
No, no, no, no...

700
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:51,850
Samuel! Samuel!

701
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:55,010
Dad?

702
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:00,490
Danny...

703
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:03,490
Daddy!

704
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:06,273
Look at me. Look at me, darling.

705
00:55:06,297 --> 00:55:08,130
There's a good boy. Come on.

706
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:10,890
<i>Let's go into the other room.
There's a good boy.</i>

707
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:14,970
Come on, darling,
let's go in here.

708
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:17,970
Oh, my God.

709
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:20,050
<i>Er... no, no, no,
look at me, look at me.</i>

710
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:22,090
Come on...

711
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:24,530
Oh... No, no, let's go... Er...

712
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:26,690
No, no, no, don't. Sorry, Mum.

713
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:28,770
Here we go.

714
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:31,010
Oh, my God! Billy.

715
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:33,210
Oh, Jesus, fuck!

716
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:35,050
<i>Erm, upstairs.
Let's go upstairs.</i>

717
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:36,850
It's all right.

718
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:38,930
Elliot, stay with me. Come on.

719
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:40,970
Come on, Elliot.

720
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:21,490
Elliot, Elliot,
Elliot, listen to me.

721
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:23,530
Elliot, stay with me.

722
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:55,570
Who's doing this to us, Ed?

723
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:09,010
We will fix this.

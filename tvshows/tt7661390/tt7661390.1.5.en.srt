1
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,380
My son was hired by
someone to kill your father.

2
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,460
<i>You're saving his skin.
I'm telling the truth.</i>

3
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,780
Fuck!

4
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,220
Whoever ordered
that hit is more dangerous

5
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,260
than the fella who
pulled the trigger.Fuck.

6
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,628
I'll be the judge
of that. Have I got

7
00:00:41,652 --> 00:00:43,940
your word you'll
leave my son alone?

8
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,380
You have my word I won't
shoot you when you walk away.

9
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,060
I'm not giving you my son.

10
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,908
I'm not sorry. Open the fucking

11
00:01:07,932 --> 00:01:10,140
<i>door! I'm not the
one who should be.</i>

12
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,260
- Head west...
- ..to Evie.

13
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,965
She'll have a boat waiting. Once

14
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:23,140
they get tired
of tracking him...

15
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,100
<i>Watch over him, Mal, for me.
Of course.</i>

16
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:58,620
15 north, east 30
over the brook, north 25.

17
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,660
And then we dig.

18
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,180
Big or small? What?

19
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,702
North 15 baby steps will put

20
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:10,300
you a fair fucking distance away

21
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,740
<i>from north 15 daddy steps.
Daddy steps?</i>

22
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,620
<i>Fucking daddy steps?
It's in metres, you twat.</i>

23
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,620
<i>Fuck me, Darren.
What? What's the problem?</i>

24
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,060
Did it have to be your initial?

25
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,740
Doesn't fucking matter,
we found it first.

26
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,580
The guy's a fucking paedo.

27
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,780
One shot and it'll
pay for everything.

28
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,580
<i>We can get away...
from all of them.</i>

29
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,580
Just us.

30
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,660
Load it.

31
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,420
<i>Oi! Oi! Get away
from that window!</i>

32
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,580
<i>Please, Mal. I've been
stuck in here for days.</i>

33
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,058
Can I not just get
some fresh air?

34
00:04:07,082 --> 00:04:08,500
<i>Just for a minute.
No, you can't.</i>

35
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,780
You're staying here
until that boat arrives.

36
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,517
But you can't just
make me get on

37
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,260
<i>a fucking boat.
I can and I will.</i>

38
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,020
Now sit down.

39
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,340
That lad and his family
want you dead.

40
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,815
Every day you spend here, the

41
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,540
more they'll come
looking for you.

42
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,580
And your dad too.

43
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,351
You think I give two shits about

44
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,340
that cunt after
what he did to loan?

45
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,245
He wouldn't have
had any reason to do it,

46
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:36,380
would he, had you not
killed who you did? Huh?

47
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,940
<i>Hey, this is big, Darren.
Way too big to fix.</i>

48
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,499
A lot of us are hurting now

49
00:04:41,523 --> 00:04:43,340
because of what you fucking did.

50
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,120
But I'm still here and you're

51
00:04:45,144 --> 00:04:47,140
<i>still alive. The
least you can do</i>

52
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,580
is make sure that we don't
hurt any more than we have to.

53
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,500
Understand?

54
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,746
Is there really no WiFi? Are you

55
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,860
still bloody going
on about that?

56
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,460
<i>There's no WiFi. There was
none last week, none yesterday</i>

57
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,489
and there's none
today and there'll

58
00:05:06,513 --> 00:05:08,580
be none tomorrow
when you ask again.

59
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,665
What about next
week? Well, the boat

60
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:12,700
will have come
and got you by then.

61
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,260
<i>Thank God. Thank fuck. There's
fuck all to do here anyway.</i>

62
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,220
He won't even let me
look out of the window.

63
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,071
Read a book, play the piano. Do

64
00:05:20,095 --> 00:05:22,100
something other
than fucking mope.

65
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,300
Here, Mal, I need you to
go up to the inn at the top.

66
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,820
I've got supplies waiting and
the kids have got the wheels.

67
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,660
<i>They're out selling my stock.
Your legs don't work, do they?</i>

68
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:37,300
<i>What? That hill?
These knees? Fucking suicide.</i>

69
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,500
I'll go. The fuck you will.

70
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,700
You must've done
something awful, huh?

71
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,820
Can't even get my
bread and beans

72
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,054
without looking over your

73
00:05:50,078 --> 00:05:51,780
<i>shoulder. No,
it's fine. I'll go.</i>

74
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,200
Just the bread and the beans, is

75
00:05:56,224 --> 00:05:57,540
it? Frank'll have a box ready.

76
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,020
A box? Oh, great. Not heavy.

77
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,980
I promise.

78
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,740
<i>How far is that pub again?
About a mile if you cut</i>

79
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,780
through the woods
and up the ridge.

80
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,620
<i>Don't worry.
I'll give you the cash for it.</i>

81
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,660
Oh, thank you for that.

82
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,220
Argh!

83
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,660
Ugh! Argh!

84
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,260
Uugghh! Argh!

85
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,060
Ugh! Uugghh!

86
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,700
Baxter, come here!

87
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:14,060
Requesting F/R
support teams on all CCTV,

88
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,100
petrol stations,
transport routes, roads,

89
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,060
high streets, all surrounding
areas. Suspect code

90
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,020
Alpha-Foxtrot-Echo-7-3-8-4.

91
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,060
Edwards, Kinney.

92
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
Leif!

93
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,220
<i>Hey! You've been told
not to come down here.</i>

94
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,900
I swear,
if you've taken any bullets...

95
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,540
<i>I haven't, I wouldn't. I
promise. Well, if you had,</i>

96
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,740
you'd be hard pressed to
shoot fuck all with that.

97
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,980
That calibre won't fit inside
your starter pistol, boy.

98
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,980
Interesting piece of metal
you've got there.

99
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,300
Who gave it to you, eh?

100
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:09,620
Because, round your way,
I only know Mikey Cartwright

101
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,380
make a toy like that
capable of killing a man.

102
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,420
You know I can't tell you.

103
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,580
The same goes for anyone
who asks where I am now.

104
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,860
Good answer.

105
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,820
How much do you make with
all this? Enough not to worry.

106
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,020
Enough to keep this place going.

107
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,459
But still not enough to pay for

108
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:34,860
a fucking internet connection?

109
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,100
Cheeky bastard.

110
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,620
How do you even start
with something like this?

111
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,540
You make what you know.

112
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,340
When you see one
that close up, you...

113
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,380
Yeah.

114
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,540
So...

115
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,860
when are you planning on
telling me who you killed?

116
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,540
Frank?

117
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,940
Frank!

118
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,220
Service is... slow.

119
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,260
Is it?

120
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,580
Frank, you there? I'm coming!

121
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,620
Can I help you? Excuse me?

122
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,180
<i>Your pint is going flat. Why
don't you fucking drink it?</i>

123
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,500
Thank you. Sure.

124
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,500
For Baxter.

125
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:38,220
Christ, I haven't seen you in
years. What is it this time?

126
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,540
Evie sent me.

127
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,340
<i>I hope you drove. I've got
a week of supplies for her.</i>

128
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,380
You know old Evie likes a drink.

129
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,420
Can hardly blame her,
living up here.

130
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,860
You ever thought about doing
a door-to-door service?

131
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,900
There's only five doors
within five miles around here

132
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,340
and in 15 years you're
the first one to complain.

133
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,020
<i>Fucking city boys.
Get fucked, would you?</i>

134
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,830
Right, now you
tell her, I got no

135
00:14:03,854 --> 00:14:05,540
luncheon meat for her this week

136
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,060
but I've thrown in
some extra beef paste.

137
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,700
Her Albert loves the stuff.

138
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,740
Lovely. Whatever. Yeah.

139
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,900
Aside from that, no changes
from what she asked for.

140
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,900
Well, other than the
two extra mouths to feed. Ha!

141
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,820
About that.

142
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,700
How long is he there? The boy?

143
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:37,620
Look, like I said, five doors,
five miles and 15 years.

144
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,728
We all help each other out with

145
00:14:39,752 --> 00:14:41,580
whatever we need to get by.

146
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,860
And no questions
asked I thought.

147
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,540
You're a talkative fucker,
aren't you?! Oi!

148
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,020
Once Albert docks tonight, sure

149
00:14:49,044 --> 00:14:50,460
to Christ, I'll be the bastard

150
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,740
helping him refuel that boat
for you ready for the morning.

151
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,670
A bit of respect
and trust wouldn't

152
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,180
go amiss, right? I'm sorry.

153
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,977
Look, um, if you want anything,

154
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:03,300
or if the lad needs anything...

155
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,500
All the lad wants
is his fucking WiFi.

156
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,740
Well, we got fuck all of that.

157
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
Are you lost?

158
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,354
Toilet? Right next to you.

159
00:15:13,378 --> 00:15:15,780
Where it says toilet. Piss only.

160
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,620
<i>Shitter's out of order.
Lucky me.</i>

161
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,660
Lucky for both of us.

162
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,340
Here, cop hold of that.

163
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,820
Terrific. Yeah. Can you manage?

164
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,180
Argh!

165
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,140
Ugh! Uugghh!

166
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,420
Are you almost done? Almost.

167
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,380
Go on, love. Set the table.

168
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,700
OK.

169
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,780
Ugh! Uugghh!

170
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,060
Stay here.

171
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,580
I want nothing to do with you.

172
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,900
Just the jeep and your gun.

173
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,300
It's not a barter.

174
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,100
Cock the barrel open
and hand it to me.

175
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,940
Come on.

176
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,980
She full?

177
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:35,140
<i>Two-thirds. She'll do a couple
of hundred before she stops.</i>

178
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,780
It's more than I need. Dad?

179
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,820
Jules, stay there! Hey! Dad?

180
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,180
Please, don't.

181
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,384
I wasn't planning to. But I will

182
00:20:44,408 --> 00:20:46,660
if you take another
fucking step.

183
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,118
Now I've got a way to go, so

184
00:20:48,142 --> 00:20:49,780
tomorrow you can call the police

185
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,220
and report it stolen,
not a moment before.

186
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,900
You don't want me as an enemy.

187
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,340
Do you understand? Now go.

188
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,380
Be with your kin.

189
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,860
The number you have called
is unavailable. Fuck!

190
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,780
Please leave a message
after the tone.

191
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,820
Mal...

192
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,500
Shouldn't you be inside?

193
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,260
Mal he said that I could...

194
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,300
I won't tell him if you won't.

195
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,540
Are you not gonna fold them?

196
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:44,420
Albert and I have been in
creases since the day we met.

197
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,180
Our laziness is one of the
few things we have in common.

198
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,260
And the kids, of course.

199
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,460
Er, Albert and I, it's made
us, having them here.

200
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,444
They came to us
in different ways

201
00:22:55,468 --> 00:22:57,260
but we love them all the same.

202
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,500
So, when's this boat arriving?

203
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,860
Before dark. What, today?

204
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,900
Well,

205
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,012
Albert won't want to set off

206
00:23:07,036 --> 00:23:09,420
for at least another day or two.

207
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,900
And if Mal gets his arse in
gear with the food and drink,

208
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,260
we'll be able to have
a proper send off for you.

209
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,849
Can't I just stay? Can't you

210
00:23:17,873 --> 00:23:19,660
just take me in like the others?

211
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,580
<i>Ah, love. I can work.
I'll do whatever you want.</i>

212
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:28,140
<i>I know you would. But
you killed someone, Darren.</i>

213
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,570
Staying here longer than needed,

214
00:23:30,594 --> 00:23:32,860
it's not safe for you, nor us.

215
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,620
Oh! Argh!

216
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,660
Argh!

217
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,220
Are you lost?

218
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,820
<i>Toilet? Right next to you.
Where it says toilet.</i>

219
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,620
<i>Piss only. Shitter's
out of order.</i>

220
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,420
Lucky me. Lucky for both of us.

221
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,300
What can I get you?

222
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,460
Oh, no, no, no.

223
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:26,550
<i>Oi, come on!
All right? Yeah, all right.</i>

224
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,790
Who are you? No-one.

225
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,734
<i>New recruit, Mum?
Nah. Just passing</i>

226
00:31:30,758 --> 00:31:32,310
through. Be gone by morning.

227
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:35,390
<i>Hey, what's all this? Are you
fucking kidding me or what?!</i>

228
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:38,990
<i>Hey! You stop walking,
old man! Evie... Stop talking!</i>

229
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,070
I'm telling you now, son,
if he drops my shopping,

230
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,710
there'll be bloody hell
to pay. He's with the boy.

231
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,910
<i>Go on. Give him a hand.
No, you fucking don't!</i>

232
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,950
You just drove right
past me with these bags.

233
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,310
I could just about throw
these in the house from here.

234
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,437
Where were you when
I needed you, halfway to

235
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:56,710
breaking my fucking
neck, huh? Are you his dad?

236
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,590
Darren, get back inside!

237
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,511
Oi! There's a lot of stock left

238
00:32:03,535 --> 00:32:05,270
over, you've been
gone over a week.

239
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,670
I expected you to shift
the lot. We couldn't deliver

240
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,463
owt to Mikey
Cartwright. Not gonna

241
00:32:09,487 --> 00:32:11,110
be able to anytime soon either.

242
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:13,150
Someone torched
him in his kiosk.

243
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:16,310
<i>Torched him? Aye, he
went up with all his stock.</i>

244
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,590
Police had cordoned it off
before we got there.

245
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:21,550
You! Evie!

246
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,670
I knew there was
something wrong. Evie!

247
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:27,470
Gimme the gun,
gimme the fucking gun!

248
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:30,350
Ugh! Ah! Hah!

249
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:34,550
<i>That's Mikey's metal.
And this, this is my slug.</i>

250
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:38,470
Ugh! Tell me the truth!

251
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:41,190
Who the fuck did you kill? Evie.

252
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:43,510
Look at me, look at me. Evie.

253
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:47,670
<i>Tell me! Evie! Who the fuck
did you kill? Finn Wallace.</i>

254
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,110
Finn?

255
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,110
Yeah.

256
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,178
Finn? No.I couldn't in all

257
00:33:00,202 --> 00:33:02,150
right tell you, could I? No, no.

258
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,023
Because you knew, you knew that

259
00:33:04,047 --> 00:33:05,670
I'd never fucking hide him.

260
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:08,790
<i>Get away from the window!
Why? Why?</i>

261
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,950
<i>Just tell me one thing.
Why would you go after him?</i>

262
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,150
<i>We didn't.
He didn't know who he was.</i>

263
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:18,110
<i>Darren! Will you step away
from the fucking window.</i>

264
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:20,150
Dad...

265
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:34,110
Aarrgghh! Aarrgghh!

266
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,950
Come on!

267
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,430
Get Darren!

268
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:27,150
Mum, please...

269
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:34,510
<i>Liam! Don't let them
surround the house!</i>

270
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:46,950
Argh! Argh! Ugh!

271
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,910
Evie!

272
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,590
Ugh! Argh! Argh!

273
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:15,150
Argh!

274
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,790
Jesus! The roof!

275
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:29,390
Now! Get on the roof!

276
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:31,830
You see anybody's
feet other than ours,

277
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:34,070
you fucking shoot
them, you hear me?

278
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:41,350
Darren! Darren!

279
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,790
Get off me!

280
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,670
Go, go, go!

281
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,670
Cover me!

282
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:22,870
Come on.

283
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:26,630
Take your hands off me.

284
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:29,550
<i>You fucking killed him.
You fucking killed loan.</i>

285
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:33,790
<i>You're fucking evil.
Get off me. Get off me!</i>

286
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:47,310
I'll hold them back
as long as I can. Thank you.

287
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:51,590
No, Evie, please,
come with us. Evie! No!

288
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:54,270
Be worth it, boy.

289
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:57,030
<i>No, no, please, come with us!
Please, Evie!</i>

290
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:59,150
<i>No, get off me!
Please, Evie, come with us.</i>

291
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:03,190
No! Evie! No! Evie!

292
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:19,670
Where does it lead?

293
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:47,990
Give me the gun.

294
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:51,550
Hey, give that to
me! That's mine.

295
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,270
Here.

296
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:10,110
Here. It's worth something now.

297
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:15,870
That'll be Al.

298
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:17,910
Come on.

299
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:20,150
We can still make it.

300
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:54,950
For a week, I've had
one bullet left in this gun.

301
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:58,630
And every day I saw it,
I swore I'd use it on you.

302
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:03,270
Take more than
that to put me down.

303
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:08,590
I've done it before.

304
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:10,950
It only took a second.

305
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:16,150
No, son. It took a lot more.

306
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:23,350
- Come on.
- Come on.

307
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:26,990
You let me get
you on that boat...

308
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,070
and I'll let you
pull the fucking trigger.

309
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:32,790
- Come on.
- Come on.

310
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:34,830
Come on.

311
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:40,590
Come on.

312
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:04,910
<i>No, no, no, no, Evie.
Keep her running.</i>

313
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:09,030
<i>We had a fucking deal! Kinney,
where the fuck is my wife?!</i>

314
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:33,990
Aarrgghh!

315
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:41,790
Aarrgghh!

316
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:17,070
Ugh! You get on that boat!

317
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:18,990
You head straight. Dad, please.

318
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:23,510
Ssh!

319
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:31,710
You push it as hard as you can.

320
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:35,870
As far as she'll go.

321
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:38,630
Come on, boy.

322
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:42,070
Stay strong.

323
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:48,390
Dad...

324
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:50,430
Son.

325
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:29,230
Why did you pick him?

326
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:12,670
Hello. Mr Kapadia's office.

327
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:16,390
<i>Yellow 2-4-6.
Yes, sir, immediately.</i>

328
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:24,270
We're done here. Everyone?

329
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:28,830
<i>More. Remove all trace
and return to London.</i>

330
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:30,870
Orders just came in.

331
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:33,830
We've got a new target.

332
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:35,870
Another son.

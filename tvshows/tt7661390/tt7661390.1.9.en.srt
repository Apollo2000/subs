1
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,600
Son...

2
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,520
Elliot...

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,920
what do I always say?

4
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,880
Pawns can't be kings.

5
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,120
But what can they be?

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,840
Free.

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,200
That's right.

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,240
Free to roam.

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,800
No heavy crown weighing us down.

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,840
Round three.

11
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,280
Listen, I have to take a fall
in the third.

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,480
Don't worry.

13
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,000
It's gonna look a lot worse
than it really is.

14
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,840
I love you, son.

15
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,520
You never forget that.

16
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,520
I love you, son.

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,560
Look this way.

18
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,840
Lean forward. Lean forward.

19
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,000
Sample. Stand up.

20
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,800
Jacket.

21
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,880
Your shoes, your
trousers. Sample.

22
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,920
Sit down.

23
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,720
Breathe. DCI Hawks, is he here?

24
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,760
Pardon? Where is DCI Hawks?

25
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,400
<i>Victoria. Victoria. Detective
Cheung, is she here?</i>

26
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,800
Wait, wait, wait,
wait. Where are we?

27
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,960
<i>His readings are stable.
I'll be back to check on him.</i>

28
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
Sit.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,400
Who knows he's
here? No-one, sir.

30
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,440
All yours.

31
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,840
Please confirm your name.

32
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,320
Elliot.

33
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,960
<i>Elliot Carter. I'm an
undercover police officer-</i>

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,600
Just the questions
I ask, please.

35
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,080
You were present at the Hotel
Reno last night, correct?

36
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,473
Correct. And you came in contact

37
00:03:08,497 --> 00:03:10,800
with Sean Wallace at what time?

38
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,960
Around... 0400, 0430.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,886
Between those two times. And you

40
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,760
left the location at what time?

41
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,960
I don't know. You don't know?

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,518
I didn't stop to
check my watch when

43
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:25,040
your people started
shooting at me.

44
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,160
<i>What were you running from?
I just told you. No, Elliot.</i>

45
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,880
<i>You didn't.What department
you say you were with again?</i>

46
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,520
Sean Wallace blew up
a building two days ago.

47
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,760
That's an act of terrorism.

48
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,240
Terrorism? Hmm.

49
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,080
So, I need to know why you
went to meet him last night.

50
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,840
What's that? What's in the bags?

51
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,720
Now you are asking
the right questions.

52
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,800
What's going on?!

53
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,240
There's been reports of an
explosion in the city tonight

54
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,318
at the Belvedere
Tower. The emergency

55
00:04:28,342 --> 00:04:30,240
services arrived
in record time...

56
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,299
As the area was
cleared, the extent

57
00:04:32,323 --> 00:04:34,080
of the damage became apparent.

58
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,480
News of the Belvedere Tower
collapsed has overshadowed

59
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,297
what should've been a morning

60
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,240
of celebration for Nasir Afredi

61
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,028
and his party. Here's what the

62
00:04:43,052 --> 00:04:44,880
new Mayor of London had to say.

63
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,400
I come to office in the advent
of a disaster

64
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,440
which has shook London.

65
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,328
Thankfully, the

66
00:04:51,352 --> 00:04:53,440
recently-completed
Belvedere Tower

67
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,720
had not yet opened,
and no lives were lost.

68
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,240
The emergency services have
been working through the night

69
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,200
to eliminate any immediate
danger to our civilians,

70
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,800
and, as always, the
people of London

71
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,967
have come together
in the spirit...

72
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:10,200
<i>Thanks very much.
We'll be in touch.</i>

73
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,600
Mr Afredi, do you have any
more information

74
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,360
about what could cause a new
building to collapse? For now,

75
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,160
I can confirm a thorough
investigation is underway

76
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,556
to determine the
cause of the blast

77
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,760
which took down Belvedere Tower.

78
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,760
So I ask you all
to remain vigilant,

79
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,120
and as your new mayor, I
will do everything in my power

80
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,480
to protect this city form harm.

81
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,080
<i>His death's on us, Vicky.
Anthony was a good cop.</i>

82
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,000
How do I explain that to his
family? Tell me, how the fuck

83
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,560
<i>do I explain that, Vicky? I
just need you to listen to me.</i>

84
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,880
I know, wait-
I'm going after Elliot.

85
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,000
<i>What? He can stand trial with
Sean Wallace.</i>

86
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,400
I want you to talk to
Elliot's girlfriend,

87
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,680
<i>Shannon Dumani. Get as much
information from her as we can</i>

88
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,720
before they shut
this thing down.

89
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,000
<i>I'm sorry, Vicky. I know
how much you put into it.</i>

90
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,320
<i>Amen. I don't know
where Sean is.</i>

91
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,200
Give me time.

92
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,040
<i>I'll get him away from London.
He shot me, Marian.</i>

93
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,640
<i>He could've killed me.
But he didn't.</i>

94
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,000
For Christ sake,
Ed, we're family.

95
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,480
He took down their building.

96
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,880
They want you and
Sean dead, Marian.

97
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,320
And if I don't deliver that,
Alexander dies.

98
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,880
Tell me where he is and I'll
spare Billy and Jacqueline.

99
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,920
You've got our
investor's attention. Good.

100
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,840
Soon I'll have
the world's attention.

101
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,040
Every building I take down
will bring more questions.

102
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
They want to meet.

103
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,080
Face to face, make a deal.

104
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
Face to face?

105
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,680
Yeah.OK.

106
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,760
<i>I'll send you my address.
We go together.</i>

107
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,800
OK, brother? Yeah.

108
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,280
We've unlocked that cop's
phone for you, Mr Wallace.

109
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,600
Come on, come on, come on.

110
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,720
Sean, mate, where
the fuck are you?

111
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,760
I'm out here by myself.

112
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,720
Look, we're gonna be stronger
if we're together.

113
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
I don't know
where you are, so...

114
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
call me, please.

115
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,040
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

116
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,520
Reno, Reno, Reno.

117
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,200
That's gonna bug me.

118
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,240
In what state is Reno
situated? Nevada.

119
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,720
OK. Let's get back to it.

120
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,138
Why did you run
when the officers

121
00:11:30,162 --> 00:11:32,280
arrived on the scene, Elliot?

122
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,213
For my safety. Police have the

123
00:11:34,237 --> 00:11:36,400
right to shoot a
suspect who runs.

124
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,800
<i>You know that. So why did you
shoot back?</i>

125
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,240
<i>I was confused. Or, maybe
you were acting on an order.</i>

126
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,120
<i>What? Who gave
you the order to run</i>

127
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,080
when the police entered
the building? No-one.

128
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,280
Mr-No-one. I don't know-

129
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,920
Answer him.

130
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,720
Come on, now. Who ordered you?

131
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,480
You're pissing me off, Elliot.

132
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,031
No-one ordered me! I don't

133
00:12:17,055 --> 00:12:19,000
know what you're talking about.

134
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,080
Talk to a Victoria,
Detective Cheung.

135
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,000
<i>She's my handler. Or ask
DCI Hawks, talk to Hawks.</i>

136
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,074
<i>He'll back me up.
Hawks? Oh.Talk to.</i>

137
00:12:29,098 --> 00:12:31,040
Hawks, he'll tell
you everything.

138
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,680
<i>Hawks. Yes, your
superior, Hawks.</i>

139
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,480
No. I don't think he will.

140
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,240
We're your only
friends now, Elliot.

141
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,680
You're on your own.

142
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,080
<i>No. No, I didn't do that.
I didn't do that!</i>

143
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,120
No!

144
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,680
I wanna know about the people
who invest in the Wallaces.

145
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,800
I wanna know if you had
any contact with them.

146
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,080
And I wanna know who the fuck

147
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,600
you are working for now.

148
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,160
Because it ain't
Her Majesty's Police.

149
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,540
Mr Kapadia?

150
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,299
Here's where we're at. I've been

151
00:14:15,323 --> 00:14:16,620
on the phone to Asia all night

152
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,276
and our clients
have been completely

153
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,540
reassured that their assets

154
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,896
are all safe. When America wakes

155
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,380
up I'll be on the
phone first thing

156
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,693
to New York, and then the west

157
00:14:23,717 --> 00:14:25,180
<i>coast. You know,
our underwriters,</i>

158
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,580
<i>they've been working overtime.
Guys, I'm telling you,</i>

159
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,220
there is nothing to worry about.

160
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,060
Mr Kapadia, your
time has run out.

161
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,420
We can help you,
or you can help yourself.

162
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,060
<i>You're a very kind minister.
My son is a genuine person.</i>

163
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,700
I'm on my way to see him,
and I'll pass that on.

164
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,740
Right. Thank you.

165
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,940
Henry, I'll walk the last block.

166
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:27,940
Who won? Nasir Afredi? Who won?

167
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,580
Yes, actually, Nasir is my son.

168
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,166
Aw, he's such a lovely man. I

169
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,020
just met him at
the victory party.

170
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,260
You must be so
proud of him. I am.

171
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,100
Asif Afredi.

172
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,300
Pleasure to meet you.

173
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,180
And what is your name, my dear?

174
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,580
Nasir got my vote.

175
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,180
We're all looking forward
to hearing him speak.

176
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,700
Oh, Mr Afredi, are
you after Nasir?

177
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,060
He took a meeting with a
journalist. They're upstairs.

178
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,100
Thank you.

179
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,580
Nasir. Oh, thank God.

180
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,620
I don't know what
I was thinking.

181
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,340
Well?

182
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,780
It's done.

183
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,820
You got what you wanted.

184
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,420
I feel nothing. Nothing at all.

185
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,980
At least honour his death
with satisfaction.

186
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,220
You are judging me?

187
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,780
Why did you come back here?

188
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,140
I've helped you get Asif.

189
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,940
What do you expect
from me? Nothing.

190
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,100
I'm going back to Kurdistan.

191
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,180
I'm not like you.

192
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,942
I only wanted to
hurt one man. All

193
00:18:30,966 --> 00:18:32,860
the other bloodshed's
because of you.

194
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,060
You're prepared to
let your own family die?

195
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,260
That's the reality of
my struggle. We suffer.

196
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,660
<i>This life's a choice for you.
I didn't choose this.</i>

197
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,900
Every penny I make goes back
to Kurdistan.

198
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,736
I stand for the freedom of my

199
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,820
<i>people. Who do
you stand for now?</i>

200
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,180
Your business is over, your
family's being hunted down.

201
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,220
Why are you here?

202
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,940
Fuck you, Sean Wallace.

203
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,540
Please leave a message
after the tone.

204
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,340
Jeevan, it's Alex.

205
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,620
I have a solution
to our problem.

206
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,580
I'm on my way over.

207
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,620
It's gonna be OK.

208
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,700
<i>Stand back, please, sir.
Stand back.</i>

209
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,940
Stand back, please,
sir. Stand back.

210
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,980
Did the investors kill
Jeevan Kapadia?

211
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,700
I don't know anything

212
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,740
about any investors.

213
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,811
I know you're lying, Elliot.

214
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,100
But that's OK. We'll get there.

215
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,380
What took you so long
to get to Sean?

216
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,060
Elliot.

217
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,980
Tell me how you found him.

218
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,580
All flights and boarding
gates are experiencing delays

219
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,620
due to an increased level
of security.

220
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,260
Please allow additional time
to reach your boarding gate

221
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,049
and passing additional security

222
00:21:26,073 --> 00:21:27,900
tests before boarding the plane.

223
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,140
Billy. Billy, can you hear me?

224
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,860
<i>I can't find Sean.
I'm worried about him.</i>

225
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,900
He's on his own, Billy.

226
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,020
<i>Listen, Bill, you're safe.
I know you are.</i>

227
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,097
<i>But he's not.
Everyone's turned against</i>

228
00:21:43,121 --> 00:21:44,820
him, everyone wants to hurt him.

229
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,860
Just... tell me where he is

230
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,900
so he doesn't have to be alone.

231
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,380
Bill. Billy.

232
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,140
There's an old hotel
by Dagenham Docks.

233
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,096
It got ruined in the '70s,

234
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,580
it's now a club run by Yardies.

235
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,580
And they still rent rooms there.

236
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,620
I keep one for when I need
to escape.

237
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,700
If I was Sean
that's where I'd be.

238
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,300
Room 307, Hotel Reno.

239
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,580
Thank you. Don't thank me.

240
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,260
Just keep my brother safe.

241
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,780
And if anything
happens to him...

242
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,300
if anyone hurts him...

243
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,980
I'll kill you, Elliot.

244
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,980
Ready? Yeah.

245
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,157
I've got eyes on Elliot Carter.

246
00:22:50,181 --> 00:22:51,700
He's just finished up on a call

247
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,100
and he's heading east on
Markville Road.

248
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,460
Stay on him. We're on our way.

249
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,300
<i>Carter's heading east on foot.
With any luck he'll lead us</i>

250
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,060
<i>to Sean Wallace. Let's go.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.</i>

251
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,140
How did we get here? Finn.

252
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,660
Finn Wallace charmed us
all to death.

253
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,900
And you chose him.

254
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,300
You broke my heart.

255
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,300
I tried.

256
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,860
<i>I'm exhausted, Marian.
I'm exhausted.</i>

257
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,980
Let me get Sean
away from here. I can't.

258
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,300
I'm sorry.

259
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:21,660
<i>Shannon Dumani? Yeah.
Can I have a word?</i>

260
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,820
I want to know about your
ex husband, Steven Young.

261
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,860
What about him?

262
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,127
You say he's in prison, but I

263
00:25:29,151 --> 00:25:31,700
couldn't find any
of his records.

264
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,766
I did find the missing person's

265
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,860
report his mother filed in 2016.

266
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,900
People go missing all the time.

267
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,780
Who are you protecting, Shannon?

268
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,820
Your dad?

269
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,860
Your brother?

270
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,480
Look, I know your husband wasn't

271
00:25:49,504 --> 00:25:51,340
<i>good to you. No,
you know fuck all.</i>

272
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,860
You've got a good poker face.

273
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,620
Could use someone like you
on the inside.

274
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:02,580
<i>I need an informant.
You are out of your mind.</i>

275
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,772
And I would hate for social

276
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:05,180
services to think that there was

277
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,460
anything wrong
with Danny's welfare.

278
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,540
You fucking threaten me again-
I don't give a fuck

279
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,700
how some wife beat at his end.

280
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:17,260
But if leaning on this
gets you on my side...

281
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,300
then, yeah.

282
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,300
I just want Sean
Wallace, Shannon.

283
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,380
I only told Elliot
he was in prison.

284
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,980
Does he work for you?

285
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,060
Elliot's no longer on the case.

286
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,340
<i>He fucked up too many times.
You'll never see him again.</i>

287
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,540
So he's police?

288
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,940
Was.

289
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,380
Look, I know you're not like
your family,

290
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,580
and I know you just wanna
protect Danny, I get it,

291
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,460
but is this really the
best life you want for him?

292
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,020
Think about it.

293
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,372
Come and work for me and I

294
00:27:07,396 --> 00:27:09,140
promise I will get you both out.

295
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,220
Does anyone else know
that you're here, cos...

296
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,020
if my dad finds out... No.

297
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,100
Just between us.

298
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,300
Sorry, I just need a moment.

299
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,140
Come on, Vicky, pick up.

300
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,180
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

301
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,941
Hello, this is Dave's Mechanics.

302
00:27:41,965 --> 00:27:43,180
Please leave a message

303
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,220
and we'll get back to you.

304
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,260
It's me.

305
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,940
Sorry I ignored your calls.

306
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,020
Look...

307
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,980
I've got Sean
Wallace's location.

308
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,020
I'm bringing him in.

309
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,700
<i>This is it. He's
gonna stand trial.</i>

310
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,980
Hotel Reno, Dagenham Docks.

311
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,020
Room 307. That's all I've got.

312
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,660
I'm sorry, Vic.

313
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,820
I'm gonna make sure
this has all been worth it.

314
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,820
And, Vic...

315
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,860
look after yourself, OK.

316
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,340
There's a lot you don't know
about me.

317
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,340
What the fuck?

318
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,900
Mr Carter.

319
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,860
Did the investors get to
you before Reno, Elliot?

320
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,700
Who are you working for?

321
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,100
What was said?

322
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,260
What did they have you do?

323
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:17,340
<i>Carter is on the move.
Don't let him out of sight.</i>

324
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,380
I'm preparing an SFO unit.

325
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,400
<i>I'm glad you made it, Elliot.
Come on up, my friend.</i>

326
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,560
Assembly SFO units
outside Hotel Reno, over.

327
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,990
This is DCI Hawks. We'll wait

328
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:23,520
for Carter to bring Wallace out

329
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,477
<i>into the open.
Await my instruction,</i>

330
00:31:25,501 --> 00:31:27,440
we can't afford any
more casualties.

331
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,640
Give us the fucking money!

332
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,135
I've got no money. Where did

333
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,840
you fucking put it? Where is it?

334
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,600
Sir, confirming that Carter
has entered the building.

335
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,640
It's pretty crowded in here.

336
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,920
I'm here to see
Sean. Who are you?

337
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,360
Elliot. Arms up.

338
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,360
<i>What? No weapons near me.
We're a hippie commune.</i>

339
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,800
I'll look after that for you.

340
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,520
So you got to Billy?

341
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,440
We're worried about you, mate.

342
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,600
That's sweet of you, Elliot.

343
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,640
Belonged to Anthony, that
undercover you went after.

344
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,280
Dead, along with
Colin, apparently.

345
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,400
Had some interesting
messages, too.

346
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,480
Messages about you.

347
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,520
And the people you work for.

348
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,560
You fucking snake.

349
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,320
You disgust me.

350
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,560
There's nothing worse
than your kind.

351
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,760
I can think of worse.

352
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,800
I let you into my home

353
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,840
the day of my dad's funeral.

354
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,480
You snivelled your way into my
family using some lie

355
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,120
<i>about a dead wife and child.
It's not a lie.</i>

356
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,440
Who are you?

357
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,520
<i>Just police.No.
You're messed up.</i>

358
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,560
Why do you want to take me down?

359
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,520
<i>It's not personal.
You're a criminal.</i>

360
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,560
You have to request to go
undercover.

361
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,600
You didn't have a life, did you?

362
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,560
Now you're fucking
a gangster's daughter.

363
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,301
Is that exciting
for you? I don't

364
00:34:48,325 --> 00:34:50,200
give a shit what
you think about me.

365
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,000
My whole life I've seen
people like you

366
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,040
get away with it.

367
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,240
Do you think you're special?

368
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,040
Different rules apply.

369
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,120
And you're right.

370
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,480
<i>Most of the time.
This some righteous mission?</i>

371
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,960
Nah.

372
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,600
It's just a mission.

373
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,280
I think you've enjoyed this job.

374
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,640
A man taking down the Wallaces.

375
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,280
Gave you a purpose.

376
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,080
Otherwise you're just a nobody.

377
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,200
I've got something very
special lined up for you.

378
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,280
Who are you working for, Elliot?

379
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,858
Elliot, give me a name.

380
00:36:04,882 --> 00:36:07,120
Elliot, give me a name. A name.

381
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,560
<i>Elliot. Elliot, give me a
name. That's enough.</i>

382
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,640
Forensics need a word.

383
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,680
And I need to check his vitals.

384
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,080
Then be quick.

385
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,160
He's running out of time.

386
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,600
Elliot, you've done really well.

387
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,440
Now I need you to listen to me
really carefully.

388
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,920
These words.

389
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,040
Do you understand?

390
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,920
Don't leave me.

391
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,960
Thank you.

392
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,120
Hello, Elliot. Thirsty, huh?

393
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,865
I need to make a call. What the

394
00:37:12,889 --> 00:37:15,360
fuck did you just say to me?

395
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,840
If you want me to
tell you about them

396
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,760
<i>I need to speak to my dad.
Whoa, whoa.</i>

397
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,800
I need to say goodbye.

398
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:28,160
Do not fuck with me, Elliot, hm?

399
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,280
No more chances now.

400
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,120
Hello?

401
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,120
Hello, Dad. Elliot?

402
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,240
Is that you?

403
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,280
Yeah.

404
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,400
Yeah, it's me.

405
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,432
Where have you
been? Dad, listen.

406
00:38:08,456 --> 00:38:10,000
I've been calling and calling.

407
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,760
I've got into a bit of
a scrape, haven't I?

408
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,480
It's gonna look like I
took a fall in the third...

409
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,440
but I'm gonna
take it all the way.

410
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,080
Where are you, son?

411
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,120
Do you remember that place

412
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,760
we used to talk
about travelling to?

413
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,880
<i>Yeah, sure. I know
where you mean.</i>

414
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,640
How about you make a head start.

415
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,160
So soon? Yeah.

416
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,200
Yeah.

417
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,240
I'll catch up with you.

418
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,480
<i>Oh, Dad... you were wrong
about one thing.</i>

419
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,200
Pawns can be kings.

420
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,120
I love you, Dad.

421
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,400
Never forget that.

422
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,160
<i>I've kept to my word.
Now you keep to yours.</i>

423
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,880
<i>Hmm? Tell me everything
you know about them.</i>

424
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:33,080
When I found you were I wanted
to crack your skull open.

425
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,840
Then I realised you might be
the only way

426
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,880
for me to get what I want.

427
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,040
My father was hiding cash
for our so-called investors.

428
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,640
Funds meant for
hospitals or schools

429
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,280
in some piss-poor corner
of the world.

430
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,960
Real corruption.

431
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
A building I blew up,

432
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,280
80% of the capital used
came through tax havens.

433
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,680
<i>All the people involved.
All the companies.</i>

434
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,960
Years of information,
years of implication on there.

435
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,080
Why are you doing this?

436
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,600
I got it wrong.

437
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,223
I've been punishing the wrong

438
00:40:12,247 --> 00:40:13,960
people. You want me to go after

439
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,560
<i>the people you work for?
The buildings they own.</i>

440
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,320
There are bodies
in the foundations.

441
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,720
Work with me.

442
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,174
These people will never see

443
00:40:25,198 --> 00:40:26,840
the inside of a prison, Elliot.

444
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,280
<i>They build them.
Now you sound righteous.</i>

445
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,600
I'm on a fucking crusade.

446
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,880
What about Alexander?

447
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,200
He already chose
his side of the fight.

448
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,120
Stop. Raise your arms.

449
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,720
I'm asking you to look beyond
the circus.

450
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,960
Take down the real showmen.

451
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,440
Alex Dumani. Let him in.

452
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,160
Brother. How are you?

453
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,360
<i>I need to speak to Sean alone.
No, Elliot stays.</i>

454
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,760
OK, then, let's
me and you go.No.

455
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,520
We're all staying around here.

456
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,560
Say what you've gotta say.

457
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,960
I know there's no
investors waiting.

458
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,080
You fucked it, Sean.

459
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,720
What did you expect to achieve,

460
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,360
directly attacking
our investors?

461
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,320
The Wallace organisation's
hanging on by a thread.

462
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,000
They killed Finn, now Jeevan.

463
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,040
You can't win.

464
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,640
What? Something funny? Yeah.

465
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,280
You still think any of
this means anything?

466
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,960
<i>Wake up. Think
about what we built.</i>

467
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,080
<i>It's all sand and lies. And
billions of fucking pounds!</i>

468
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,840
<i>Which we could've lived on!
Spent, invested,</i>

469
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,880
done whatever
the fuck we wanted!

470
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,320
You know, people kill for this.

471
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,680
My father must've
recognised himself in you.

472
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,240
Your filthy greed. Fuck you.

473
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,280
If you want to take his place...

474
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,080
you're gonna need to be good
at more than just numbers.

475
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,280
If you do this, Alex,

476
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,320
you'll never come back from it.

477
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,680
I promise you.

478
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,040
No-one else knows you like I do.

479
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,640
The shit we've survived.

480
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,880
There's no-one who can plan it
like us.

481
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,400
No. No way.

482
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,440
It's too late, Sean.

483
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,800
If you kill me, Alex...

484
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,200
you'll be alone.

485
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,520
You know that, don't you?

486
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,520
Think you can do it?

487
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,400
You're not an evil bastard
like your dad. Shut up.

488
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,200
<i>How many has he killed?
Fucking gravedigger.</i>

489
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,071
We're nothing like our fathers,

490
00:44:12,095 --> 00:44:13,640
<i>Alex. It don't
fucking matter now,</i>

491
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,200
<i>does it? Cos I
don't have a choice.</i>

492
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,400
Yeah. Yeah, you do.

493
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,720
<i>Took down by your family.
No, you have a choice.</i>

494
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,600
You're the smartest person
in the room.

495
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,640
Cleverest man I know.

496
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,400
We can work this out, Alex.

497
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,320
Just me and you. Think about it.

498
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,680
Really think about it.

499
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,280
I have thought about it.

500
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,280
<i>I fucking love you, Alex.
Shut the fuck up!</i>

501
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,320
Shut up!

502
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,120
We started together.

503
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,440
We can fucking take them down
together.

504
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Me... and you.

505
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,480
It's all right. It's all right.

506
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,840
No!

507
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,520
<i>Shots fired! Shots fired!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!</i>

508
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,320
Mr Carter.

509
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,200
Sean Wallace must
never stand trial.

510
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,880
Alex Dumani must remain in play.

511
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,360
That is non negotiable.

512
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,400
Who are you people?

513
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,200
Go, go, go, go, go!

514
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:38,120
<i>Cover your mouth, Alex. Cover
your mouth. Cover your mouth!</i>

515
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,120
Here. Here!

516
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,160
We gotta go, we
gotta go. Come on.

517
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,200
Come on.

518
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,360
Move. Let's go, let's go.

519
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,440
Ready? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

520
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,560
Let's go.

521
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,760
Get the fuck out the way!

522
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,920
Elliot, it's over.

523
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,800
Get out of the way. Move, move.

524
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,080
Move, move!

525
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,320
Everybody on the ground.

526
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,880
Stay on the ground. Face down.

527
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,360
<i>No, no, no, wait, wait.
Stay down. Stay down.</i>

528
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,840
Elliot Carter.

529
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,640
Sean Wallace.

530
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,960
Get up, go, go, now.

531
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,720
Elliot.

532
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,480
Go, go, go, go.

533
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,160
Elliot, stand down!

534
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,000
<i>Get out of the way!
Everyone, get down.</i>

535
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,200
Go, go, go.

536
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,760
Go, go, go, go.

537
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,200
<i>Elliot, hold it. Stand down.
Stand down.</i>

538
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,920
Alex, cover.

539
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,880
Go, go, go, go, go.

540
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,880
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

541
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,440
<i>Go, go, go, go! Get
the fuck out of here. Go!</i>

542
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,480
Who the fuck are you?

543
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,040
Just go, go, go, go.

544
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,280
<i>Through the gate.
Go, go! Fucking go!</i>

545
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,760
I'm unarmed.

546
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,040
I'm unarmed. I'm unarmed!

547
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:18,200
<i>I'm unarmed. I'm unarmed.
I'm unarmed. I'm unarmed.</i>

548
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,120
I am, I am. I am.

549
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,160
I am.

550
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,560
Do you understand what we
are asking of you, Mr Carter?

551
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,600
We know you have lost
loved ones before.

552
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,520
You have a chance
to save their lives.

553
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,960
Sean Wallace is dead.

554
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,680
I repeat, Sean Wallace is dead.

555
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,920
The people who wanted
Sean Wallace dead.

556
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,760
Tell me how to
find them, Elliot.

557
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,520
You've only just brushed up
against them.

558
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,480
I've been on this for...

559
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,080
years.

560
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,280
Help me.

561
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:39,360
<i>And what about me? You can be
whoever you want to be.</i>

562
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,600
You can go wherever
you want to go.

563
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,760
We're offering a life
few get to live.

564
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,360
Trust us.

565
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,920
The people I work for...

566
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,640
sent you a message.

567
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,600
OK.

568
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,440
I am protected under
diplomatic immunity

569
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,760
by the Republic Of Panama.

570
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,920
He's saying he's
working with them.

571
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,920
Panama. What now? Hmm?

572
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,040
Fuck!

573
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,200
You have just bought your way

574
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:04,960
into a very dangerous
world, friend.

575
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,720
Shit.

576
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,320
<i>Well done, Elliot.
We'll be in touch.</i>

577
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,640
Marian.

578
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,680
I'm going to help you.

579
00:57:52,457 --> 00:57:55,040
Full Stop praying
for more exposure

1
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,930
My father was taken from us
on the streets of London.

2
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,730
I assure you we had no hand
in his death.

3
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,610
Sean asked me to find the guy
who killed his father.

4
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:22,650
Where's Frank?

5
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,410
Sooner or later they're
gonna find out about her.

6
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,330
Say nothing to no-one, you hear?

7
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,730
<i>Nothing gets brought in.
Nothing gets shipped out.</i>

8
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,481
<i>Not today, Billy, please.
The only business to get</i>

9
00:00:35,505 --> 00:00:38,130
done will be finding out
who pulled the trigger.

10
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,010
Please tell Asif this won't
affect our arrangement.

11
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,970
Sean, Billy, we're here.

12
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,490
<i>Can I shoot a rabbit?
Here. Go on.</i>

13
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,290
We'll meet you up at the
old barn, all right? Come on.

14
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,410
It'll be OK.

15
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,090
Hold on there, boys.

16
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,130
Come 'ere.

17
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,850
We were born
into a certain world.

18
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,170
It was chosen for us. Fated.

19
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,770
Some might think it's brutal.

20
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,170
I say it's glorious.

21
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,959
Now, if you can do
this one thing, then

22
00:02:26,983 --> 00:02:29,490
you can have all
that it has to offer.

23
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,490
Do you want that, son?

24
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,490
Yeah.

25
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,890
I want you to
take this man's life.

26
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,970
<i>What did he do?
He made a bargain.</i>

27
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,570
<i>Just like you're about to.
Once you enter this world,</i>

28
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,610
you accept that you must kill,
or in turn you may be killed.

29
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,650
Once you understand that rule,
it's easy.

30
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,970
You can take a life
without hesitation.

31
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,090
You can build an
empire, be a king.

32
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,770
Just breathe.

33
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,250
Please, please. I'm sorry.

34
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,730
I'm sorry, you don't have
to do this, please! Don't.

35
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,090
<i>Please, I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
please! Please. Please.</i>

36
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,570
Finn... Please.

37
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,321
Please, I'm so sorry, you don't

38
00:04:14,345 --> 00:04:16,650
have to do it. No, please!

39
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,050
<i>No, don't please!
Please! Please.</i>

40
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,530
Just shoot the bucket.

41
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,610
Please. Please.

42
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,050
Please, no.

43
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,010
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

44
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,650
Sorry. Sorry, Christ! I'm sorry!

45
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,170
Please!

46
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,810
Please. You don't have to do it!

47
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,970
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

48
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:44,370
Please. I'm so sorry!

49
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:01,050
What the fuck is this?

50
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,970
They're fucking empty!

51
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,690
Jack! Jack, open up!

52
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,290
<i>Psych evaluation.
DI Elliot Carter.</i>

53
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:42,250
<i>In the presence of Dr May.
12th March, 2020.</i>

54
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,570
Have you had any
trouble sleeping?

55
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,850
No.

56
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,290
<i>Any nightmares?
Negative thoughts?</i>

57
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,370
No.

58
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,850
Experiencing a loss of appetite?

59
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,650
No.

60
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,370
He's been undercover
for two years.

61
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,990
He's getting closer to the

62
00:10:07,014 --> 00:10:09,170
violence but not
to any evidence.

63
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,090
This is how UCs get killed.

64
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,410
This is different. It's worse.

65
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,210
He's unstable.

66
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,450
Do you think about
your wife, Naomi?

67
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,570
How long has it
been since she died?

68
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,450
Two years.

69
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,850
And your son
Samuel, or was it Sam?

70
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:45,450
<i>Samuel.
Do you think about Samuel?</i>

71
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,050
Of course I do.

72
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,375
Just let it play out. See what

73
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:57,490
he comes up
with. All I'm asking.

74
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:00,410
<i>Is he compromised?
Taken any risks</i>

75
00:11:00,434 --> 00:11:03,170
we can't explain to a judge? No.

76
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,850
He's careful.

77
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,890
We've been here before, Vic.

78
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,930
Years of surveillance wasted
when a UC loses his way.

79
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,690
Let's hope this is different.

80
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:35,170
You did it. He's keeping you in.

81
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:38,930
<i>We can do this, Vic.
I've felt the shift.</i>

82
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,690
We know Sean threw a boy
off a building.

83
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,372
May he rest in peace
but if it doesn't connect

84
00:11:44,396 --> 00:11:46,890
to the shell companies,
or the asset funds,

85
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,250
it doesn't touch
the Wallace organisation.

86
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,410
We know they launder through
their property empire, hmm?

87
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,640
Sean is overseeing all that now.

88
00:11:54,664 --> 00:11:57,010
He's not just
building the towers.

89
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,370
<i>Then we need a paper trail.
Alex?</i>

90
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,090
Dumani? He pushes the numbers.

91
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,187
Keeps his nose
clean. Steers clear of

92
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:06,290
<i>the bodies. That's
helpful to us how?</i>

93
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:09,490
No way he can stay clean
while Sean's running it.

94
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:14,090
And if we're lucky, this will
get messy. Lucky? For whom?

95
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,770
Yes, Mr Wallace.

96
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,450
Fucking 'ell Jack.

97
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,090
What does it look like to you?

98
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,010
I mean, I dunno.

99
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:09,610
A man doesn't fight for
his life then kill himself.

100
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:12,490
You're the only one he told
about the Traveller kid.

101
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:16,210
Lot of havoc being done
on your word.

102
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:09,612
Has done nothing to
quell the rise in foreign

103
00:14:09,636 --> 00:14:12,250
investors pushing
up our property prices.

104
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,210
Should I become
the Mayor of London,

105
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,513
I am committed to ending this

106
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,050
cycle of addiction and violence.

107
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:19,010
On the streets I will be
demanding more police.

108
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,250
More care in our communities.

109
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,760
And I want people
to stop looking

110
00:15:28,784 --> 00:15:30,930
at them as potential extremists,

111
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,250
and to start seeing them
as leaders of men.

112
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,530
<i>They got to Jack.
Slit his wrists.</i>

113
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,290
Fuck!

114
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,770
Whoever killed Finn,
they're tidying up.

115
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,930
That's what it looks like.

116
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,570
So, what do we
know about the car?

117
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,022
The number plates
belong to Patrick.

118
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,210
Day. Who? One of Kinney's crew.

119
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,858
<i>Where is he now? Gone.
Car dumped outside</i>

120
00:16:57,882 --> 00:17:00,450
<i>a warehouse, South.
Three bodies inside.</i>

121
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,090
We're on the
Kinney thing, right?

122
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,902
We've got uniform shaking down

123
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:10,810
sites now. Always a step ahead.

124
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,890
How you holding up?

125
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,010
What's Asif doing here?

126
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,407
Listen. As your partner, I

127
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:24,450
made a call. We let Asif trade.

128
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,290
We need him.

129
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:33,570
<i>My cows. Thirty years
and we never had a problem.</i>

130
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:37,330
Thirty years and you didn't
even come to the funeral.

131
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:41,090
<i>I sent my son. My
flesh and blood.</i>

132
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:44,970
Asif, we know your business
is important to us.

133
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,890
<i>We are in... an
adjustment period.</i>

134
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:55,410
<i>Sean is running things now.
It's what Finn wanted.</i>

135
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,570
My deepest condolences
for your loss.

136
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:12,770
Finn was a great man,
an excellent business partner.

137
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,023
We know who the shooter was. A.

138
00:18:15,047 --> 00:18:17,570
<i>Traveller kid. My
men are looking.</i>

139
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,433
You've got trouble
with these people?

140
00:18:19,457 --> 00:18:21,010
Nothing to warrant killing him.

141
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,170
That's not good.

142
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,252
A man of Finn's standing should

143
00:18:25,276 --> 00:18:27,210
not be that easy to take out.

144
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,089
Your organisation is weak

145
00:18:29,113 --> 00:18:31,570
somewhere. What are you saying?

146
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,093
First they come for
you, now someone

147
00:18:34,117 --> 00:18:36,690
has got to your
business partner, me.

148
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,518
My shipment was hit
yesterday. I gave an order

149
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:42,650
that no-one moves any
dope until I find the killer.

150
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,290
It obviously didn't reach you.

151
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,170
If you impose an embargo,
you'll start a war.

152
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,970
A war was started
when my father was shot.

153
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,650
Ohhhh!

154
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,810
You've got his temper.

155
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:03,050
Believe me,
if they were to kill my son,

156
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:06,290
I would wipe out
their blood line.

157
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:11,890
But I would not lose a Rupee
in the act.

158
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,410
Be smart, Sean.

159
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:23,330
Anyone not helping find Dad's
killer looks suspect to me.

160
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,650
He always said you wanted
a piece of London.

161
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,530
Now your son's
running for Mayor.

162
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:34,090
Without our support, it
might be difficult for Nasir.

163
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:48,010
<i>Sean...
I'm down five million pounds.</i>

164
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:53,210
<i>What is bad for me...
is bad for you.</i>

165
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,250
This is shaming us as a family.

166
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,844
There was a time when nobody

167
00:20:06,868 --> 00:20:08,770
would've dared
touch Finn Wallace.

168
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,490
They got lucky.

169
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:13,130
Why was he even in that flat?

170
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:18,410
We have to be
honest with ourselves.

171
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,730
What if it was personal?

172
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,010
Some woman's husband.

173
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,027
We're not picking the flesh off

174
00:20:27,051 --> 00:20:29,050
a dead man's bones. We have to.

175
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,450
How did it go with Asif?

176
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,570
He's taken a hit.

177
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,530
A missing shipment isn't good
for any of us.

178
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,457
If there's anyone dealing smack

179
00:20:43,481 --> 00:20:45,570
in London I want
to know about it.

180
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:50,890
What can I do? Nothing.

181
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,530
I'm gonna make
things right, Mum.

182
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,490
I know you will.

183
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,050
I'm proud of you both.

184
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:24,570
<i>Billy's... clean,
and you're strong.</i>

185
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:31,810
If it was a woman
she didn't love my husband.

186
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:38,170
If she had, she wouldn't have
had him shot in the face.

187
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,970
<i>Good to see you, Ed.And
yourself. Nice place to meet.</i>

188
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,970
Next week
it's my daughter's birthday.

189
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,970
<i>How is Sean? He doesn't
know who he can trust.</i>

190
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,810
Yourself included. Come on, Ed.

191
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:45,050
You're not that stupid
to think I pulled the trigger.

192
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,050
I have no idea what Finn was
even doing there that night.

193
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:53,290
I shook hands with Finn
on the deal. A Luan deal.

194
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,890
That's my part completed.

195
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:03,650
<i>In full. And now the
Wallace organisation</i>

196
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:06,370
has to honour Finn's part.

197
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:12,570
The Wallace organisation
will do what is right for us.

198
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,810
Of course I can go to Sean.

199
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:22,850
Eddie, they say you are
the keeper of Finn's secrets.

200
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:25,290
But you didn't
know about this one.

201
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:52,690
Move!

202
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,170
Keep coming.

203
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:02,810
Stop!

204
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,850
Spread them out.

205
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,690
Good evening, gentlemen.

206
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,010
Welcome to the UK.

207
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:30,850
You are all links in the chain
of my operation.

208
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:35,290
One of you is responsible
for my cargo being hit.

209
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,770
Room service!

210
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:17,890
Nick, Nick!

211
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,330
Where did you get this?

212
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:22,970
<i>Where did you get it from?
Who's dealing?</i>

213
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,690
Nick!

214
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,490
Fuck!

215
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,409
Well, we've had every Traveller

216
00:29:41,433 --> 00:29:43,250
site in the southwest
turned over.

217
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:46,167
No sign of Kinney
and no answers. Our

218
00:29:46,191 --> 00:29:49,090
boys have put word
out on the street.

219
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:55,730
<i>He should be outside.
Elliot stays where he is.</i>

220
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:58,147
He's the only one
bringing me answers right

221
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,570
<i>now. Why did you tell
Asif to keep dealing?</i>

222
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:04,410
I told you that was
my decision. Not Dad's.

223
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,970
<i>You should've consulted me.
You were burying Finn.</i>

224
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:11,170
We need money and we trust
the Afridis. I don't.

225
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:24,690
Sean.

226
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:01,890
My son was hired by someone
to kill your father.

227
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:08,170
You're saving his skin. Yeah.

228
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,730
But I'm telling you the truth.

229
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:25,250
That's the phone
he took the job on.

230
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:27,679
Whoever ordered that
hit is more dangerous

231
00:31:27,703 --> 00:31:29,890
than the fella who
pulled the trigger.

232
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:34,130
<i>I'll be the judge of that.
I'm not...</i>

233
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:38,170
<i>giving you my son.
We don't need you to find him.</i>

234
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,296
You're bringing
too much attention

235
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,010
on us all with this bloodshed.

236
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:47,770
You took two of my men
out the other night.

237
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,050
Not one of mine.

238
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:57,610
<i>You kill Darren...
and you change nothing.</i>

239
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:03,690
<i>Whoever did this...
Leave the phone and fuck off.</i>

240
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:11,370
Have I got your word that
you'll leave my son alone?

241
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,567
You have my word
that I won't shoot

242
00:32:13,591 --> 00:32:15,770
you in the back
when you walk away.

243
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:53,810
<i>Right.
Find out who ordered that hit.</i>

244
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,250
No-one gets to Kinney's son
before us.

245
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,250
We find him.

246
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,930
Today.

247
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,490
You think I'd use a gun in here?

248
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,370
Doing a lot of second guessing
lately, partner.

249
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,250
Hello?

250
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:23,210
<i>Is Billy still there?
What's the damage?</i>

251
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:26,090
All right. I'm on my way.

252
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:29,290
I have to go and
find my brother.

253
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:31,370
Need anything from me?

254
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:38,650
I've got just the job for you.

255
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:43,302
"Hello, this is Dave's
mechanics. Please

256
00:33:43,326 --> 00:33:46,130
leave a message, and
we'll get back to you."

257
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:49,370
Finn's shooter
was a kid named Darren.

258
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,370
Son of a Traveller
called Kinney.

259
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:53,963
Sean's planning something
big tonight so I'm going

260
00:33:53,987 --> 00:33:56,410
to stay as close as I
can. You'll hear from me.

261
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:03,930
Excuse me!

262
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:28,610
<i>Good evening, sir.
Can I take your name please?</i>

263
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,370
I'm here to pick up a
package for Ed Dumani.

264
00:34:31,394 --> 00:34:33,770
Sorry sir, this is
a ticketed auction.

265
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:36,382
Yeah, I'm not here
for your auction.

266
00:34:36,406 --> 00:34:39,210
I'm here for the
package. He's with me.

267
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,490
Welcome.

268
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:50,050
Hello again.

269
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,370
Hi.

270
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:54,924
Do you mind if I take
you somewhere to

271
00:34:54,948 --> 00:34:57,810
<i>clean up? Yeah. I
think that would be best.</i>

272
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:28,770
Dylan.

273
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,250
Dylan!

274
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:39,050
Where's my brother?

275
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,290
Please.

276
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:48,330
<i>He went...
He went to score some gear.</i>

277
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:50,170
You could try Green Lanes.

278
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:23,170
What have you got?

279
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:26,410
"The messages on Kinney's
son's phone are all encrypted."

280
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,837
Still trying but I haven't

281
00:36:27,861 --> 00:36:29,650
seen anything like this before.

282
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:32,890
<i>This is professional.
Oh, the other thing.</i>

283
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:35,970
We got a tip on a location
for Kinney's site.

284
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,930
What do you want to do?

285
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,370
Sean?

286
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:45,090
"Sean, what do you want to do?"

287
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,690
Pick up.

288
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,650
Take it off. What?

289
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:08,290
<i>Your jacket.
No, look, it's no trouble.</i>

290
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:11,330
I just need the package
and I'll be off. Elliot!

291
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,570
Take off your jacket.

292
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:20,690
There. And the shirt. What?!

293
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:31,335
<i>I'm blagging it. I have no
idea how to remove stains.</i>

294
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,610
<i>Is it white wine? Wine?
Where were you raised?</i>

295
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:37,050
<i>Not in a launderette. Bicarb
of soda. Little bit of water.</i>

296
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:39,570
<i>Hey, it's Italian.
Yeah, all right, all right.</i>

297
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:43,810
<i>So, how were you raised?
By my father.</i>

298
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:47,730
Which means I learnt a lot
for myself. Yeah, me too.

299
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,937
<i>Dad I mean. But
he was firm about us</i>

300
00:37:49,961 --> 00:37:52,210
not conforming to
gender stereotypes.

301
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:55,850
By paying someone to do your
washing? Yeah. Damn straight.

302
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:00,342
So this, er, package Mark wants

303
00:38:00,366 --> 00:38:02,250
me to pick up. What is it?

304
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:03,970
It's me.

305
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:06,250
I need a driver tonight.

306
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:12,130
<i>Tonight? Like, the
whole night? Yeah.</i>

307
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,290
You got a problem with that?

308
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:16,805
No, no, I would love
to spend the whole

309
00:38:16,829 --> 00:38:19,450
night driving Miss
Daisy. Ooh, the cheek!

310
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:22,516
You know, you're an
unknown quantity, boy. And my

311
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,770
judgement holds a lot of
weight. I don't doubt that.

312
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:28,890
I'm sorry. It's just...

313
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:32,730
I think Sean needs back up
tonight. And I wanna be there.

314
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,290
Make a good impression.

315
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:38,530
I really need this job.

316
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:51,930
<i>Yes, Mr Wallace.
"I have to go and meet Alex."</i>

317
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,505
Get down to Green
Lanes and find Billy. I'm

318
00:38:54,529 --> 00:38:56,970
<i>"trusting you. Do you
understand me?"Yeah.</i>

319
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:59,170
Yeah, no problem. "Good."

320
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:02,370
More driving Miss Daisy?

321
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,610
Something like that.

322
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:23,076
What are you still
doing here? I don't know.

323
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,570
<i>Nick. I know you sold
to him this morning!</i>

324
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:29,130
<i>Get out. One bag. Get out!
One bag, come on. All right.</i>

325
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,730
One fucking bag, mate,
that's all I want. Hey, hey!

326
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:36,650
Are you here for doner or smack?

327
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:38,690
Fuck off! Get off the counter!

328
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:41,071
One bag, one
fucking bag! That's all

329
00:39:41,095 --> 00:39:43,330
I want, this could
be really easy.

330
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:45,364
This could be really
easy. Get off the

331
00:39:45,388 --> 00:39:47,610
<i>table! One fucking
bag! Get off the table!</i>

332
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:07,330
<i>How do you hide it all?
How do you mean?</i>

333
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:09,970
Come on, you know what I mean.

334
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,050
I'm afraid I don't, mate.

335
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:16,730
<i>The Wallace business.
It's all a front.</i>

336
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:23,090
No, but, like,
how does it fucking work?

337
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:26,669
Let's see what
you've got in here

338
00:40:26,693 --> 00:40:28,770
<i>then shall we?
Oi, oi. What you...?</i>

339
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:32,930
You work for these guys? Yeah.

340
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:34,747
You know they take money from

341
00:40:34,771 --> 00:40:36,690
dealers selling arms to Israel.

342
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:40,506
Now his boss
invests in one of the

343
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,650
largest coltan mines in Africa,

344
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,450
ensuring tiny hands
are never out of work.

345
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:51,170
Her CEO personally signed off
on suicide nets in Guangdong.

346
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:54,050
Everything's a front.

347
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,730
You're funny, Alex.

348
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:59,770
You're a funny fucking guy.

349
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,610
Alex.

350
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,530
That's Kinney's location.

351
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:17,290
<i>You ready?
I'm pretty wasted, Sean.</i>

352
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:24,450
<i>What are you saying?
I'm just saying... What?</i>

353
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:27,059
There might be a different
way. We don't have

354
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:29,730
to torch the whole city
to prove our strength.

355
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,329
We don't even know who's behind

356
00:41:32,353 --> 00:41:34,530
the hit yet. Finn is dead.

357
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:39,690
<i>My father. Who loved you
like you were his own son.</i>

358
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:44,370
Yeah I know, I know.

359
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:46,490
So, you coming or what?

360
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:49,810
I have to protect the business.

361
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:52,130
This isn't a good idea.

362
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:03,570
Nice and clean.

363
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,322
I can do this all fucking night,

364
00:42:34,346 --> 00:42:36,570
mate, come on! One fucking bag.

365
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:40,010
I know you did it earlier,
do it for me. One bag!

366
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:44,970
Ah, yes, one bag?

367
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,050
Hey!

368
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:08,930
Hey, er, my friend
make a mistake.

369
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:11,650
Give that back. Fuck off.

370
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:15,090
Do you know who
you're fucking with?

371
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:26,720
Take your hands out of my... In

372
00:43:26,744 --> 00:43:28,810
the car. Who the fuck are you?

373
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:34,370
<i>Leave him alone. No, no, no.
You're not listening.</i>

374
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:37,170
He's leaving. He's leaving!

375
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:40,210
<i>No, no, no!
What? Wait, wait, wait!</i>

376
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,650
Hey! Hey! Fuck!

377
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:00,530
Mum?

378
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:04,490
Billy?

379
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,490
You look good, Mum.

380
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:17,032
I last wore this on
our anniversary.

381
00:44:17,056 --> 00:44:19,170
When Finn took me to the Ritz.

382
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:21,970
You going somewhere?

383
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:25,010
I hear you found
Kinney's campsite.

384
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:27,090
That's right.

385
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:34,770
It's a night for celebration.

386
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:43,330
Without hesitation.

387
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,770
I believe in you, Sean.

388
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:51,090
I'm proud of you.

389
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:56,330
Thank you.

390
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:00,730
Thank you, son.

391
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:05,850
Right.

392
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:07,570
What do we have?

393
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:24,410
Going in like this is a
mistake. It's how we began.

394
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:28,050
<i>We needed to build a name.
That name is worth too much.</i>

395
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:31,130
Punishment has got
to be quiet. Out of sight.

396
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:33,517
They threatened my
family, Ed. And Sean is

397
00:45:33,541 --> 00:45:36,130
the only one prepared
to do anything about it.

398
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:43,010
<i>I'm coming with you.
I'll look after him.</i>

399
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:48,290
Where the fuck have you been?

400
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:52,970
Where's Elliot? Come with me.

401
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:56,410
Billy? Wait there.

402
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:09,530
<i>Lale's dealing.
That's Asif's heroin.</i>

403
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:12,170
I got it off one of her men.

404
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:14,570
You shouldn't have done that.

405
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:16,130
What?

406
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:21,610
We needed to find out who was
dealing. No, no. Not you.

407
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,690
Not you, Billy.

408
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:26,890
<i>You're sick.
Look, I wanted to help!</i>

409
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:31,570
I can... I can do something.

410
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:36,370
If you want to help,
stay away from this stuff.

411
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:39,810
How?

412
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:43,010
I'm fucking useless.

413
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,650
Dad's dead.

414
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:54,210
I don't want you to die.

415
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:59,250
I don't want you to die.

416
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:09,810
You've always looked out
for me, haven't you, Billy?

417
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,330
I thought you were ready.

418
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:54,850
But I have to do this myself.

419
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:36,130
You've missed them.

420
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:24,330
Brew?

421
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:28,650
Fucking hell!

422
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:31,330
Get in there!

423
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:44,410
Come here!

424
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:58,650
Come on! Come on!

425
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:56,610
Oh, fuck! Get out!

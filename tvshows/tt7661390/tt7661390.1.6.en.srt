1
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,091
They're representatives of the

2
00:00:16,115 --> 00:00:18,530
wealthiest and most
powerful people,

3
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,170
all here to meet your son.

4
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,650
I don't think we should tell
Sean about tonight.Agreed.

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,090
I want you to take this
man's life. What did he do?

6
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,090
He made a bargain. That's it.

7
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,010
<i>I wanted to help! If you want
to help, stay away from this.</i>

8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,035
My money will be washed through

9
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:37,690
the Wallace organisation.

10
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,730
Sean, get down!

11
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,330
Don't!

12
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,890
We will fix this.

13
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,370
Fuck!

14
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,250
It was you!

15
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,130
<i>Come on, Ed. This
doesn't end by killing me.</i>

16
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,330
Your son's life, huh?

17
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,930
You need to think about it.

18
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,650
Only You.

19
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,090
Making a cake?

20
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,330
Making a cake.

21
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,370
Doing well, Billy.

22
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,250
I need to get out of
this house, it's not home.

23
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,010
Soon.

24
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,890
It's not working, you know...

25
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,090
I'm not getting any answers.

26
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,210
Morning.

27
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,650
I'm baking a cake.

28
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,930
Well, you can't stay
here all morning.

29
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,210
I'm an injured man!

30
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,490
You think I'm going to
wait on you hand and foot?

31
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,970
Sounds good to me.

32
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,050
Stop!

33
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,970
So did I break you, then?

34
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,650
No! What?

35
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,650
Just don't ask me to move.

36
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,050
What are you thinking about?

37
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,090
Danny. Yeah?

38
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,730
If he got shot.

39
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,330
We will find out
who's doing this.

40
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,730
As for Danny, he'll be fine.

41
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,610
He's tough. Yeah.

42
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,810
He's watching
Marcus And His Magical Boots.

43
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,850
Yeah, that's that.

44
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,010
Samuel used to watch it.

45
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,490
I love that you can
talk about him with me.

46
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,730
Me too.

47
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,370
- Shit!
- Danny?

48
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,890
Danny?

49
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,330
Danny? Danny!

50
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,810
You all right, yeah?

51
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,650
Good boy.

52
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,050
Fucking hell!

53
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,090
It's fine, it's fine!

54
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,490
Are you OK, kid? You sure, yeah?

55
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:34,145
You're supposed
to be watching the

56
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:36,730
house, not on
your fucking phone!

57
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,210
Fucking do your job!

58
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,010
Excellent.

59
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,650
Yes, very good.

60
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,250
<i>When does our money come in?
Tomorrow,</i>

61
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,410
once Alex Dumani has overseen
the transfer of funds.

62
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,130
Zeus, come.

63
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:21,210
<i>Ed? Please thank Sean for
honouring his father's deal,</i>

64
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,930
particularly
in such confusing times.

65
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:28,090
Well, we can at least be
certain you didn't attack him.

66
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,757
This is everything
I've been able to

67
00:08:31,781 --> 00:08:33,970
find out from my
Albanian contacts.

68
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,290
The family that
Finn wanted to...

69
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:41,050
to get rid of made their
money in oil and storage.

70
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:48,890
You did this favour for Finn,
we washed your money,

71
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,650
or should I say, Mosi's money?

72
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,090
What, you thought
we wouldn't find out?

73
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,391
You're building a tower for him.

74
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:01,490
This is your free pass, Luan.

75
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:06,090
You get to build one tower
in this city - one.

76
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,290
But do not think
you get to go against us.

77
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,810
And careful -
Mosi as a business partner,

78
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,610
he's a dangerous man
to be making promises to.

79
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,530
Only You.

80
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,330
Hi.

81
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,530
I told Luan that Alexander
would oversee the transfer.

82
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,890
Alex will have this
done by tonight.

83
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:26,130
Think he's telling the truth
about the family he killed?

84
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,650
Yes.

85
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,090
<i>OK. Then tell Alex
to use the information</i>

86
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,490
that Luan is going to supply
to find out the connection

87
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,010
my dad had with this family,
we need that.

88
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,170
Are you three OK? We're good.

89
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,278
It's best that
everyone stays away.

90
00:10:42,302 --> 00:10:44,450
Whoever attacked
us won't stay away.

91
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,010
I know. I'll speak to you soon.

92
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,050
Take care, son.

93
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,570
We will get through this.

94
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:25,090
Dad's Big Bumper Book
Of Rules About Killing.

95
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,507
You look at that
and you still just

96
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:30,970
see a dead innocent
kid, don't you?

97
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,610
Billy's right -
this isn't working.

98
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,970
What else do you suggest?

99
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:45,570
We had a killer in our house,
and I want to know why.

100
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,239
You're the head
of the family now,

101
00:11:49,263 --> 00:11:51,650
Sean. Keep doing what it takes.

102
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,530
Elliot.

103
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,970
Where the fuck have you been?

104
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,490
I have checked
every hospital in the city,

105
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,810
praying I am not
going to find a dead UC.

106
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,130
<i>You tell me next time.
I'm sorry.</i>

107
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,450
I've been holed up
with Shannon Dumani.

108
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,970
They got me the best doctors,
I'm good.

109
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,370
You need a full medical
and a full psych.

110
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:50,450
<i>I can't, there's no time.
Sean summoned me.</i>

111
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,921
He's spent the
week hiding out with

112
00:12:52,945 --> 00:12:55,330
his mum and Billy
in a safe house.

113
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:58,530
He doesn't know who tried
to kill him or who to trust,

114
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,850
but he trusts me,
I took a bullet for him.

115
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,521
A hired killer posing as a

116
00:13:02,545 --> 00:13:04,770
waitress to get
into their home -

117
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,050
this isn't
some ordinary gang takeover.

118
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,848
If the Wallaces want to survive,

119
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,490
they've got to figure it out,

120
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,610
and I'll be next to Sean
when they do.

121
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:16,370
I'll get you the names
and the connections.

122
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:19,046
This could be about so much more

123
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,970
than just taking
down the Wallaces.

124
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,010
Whoever did this,
they'll do it again.

125
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,290
I wanted to talk this through
before going to Sean.

126
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,810
Sure.

127
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,970
I don't think it
was a coincidence

128
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,110
Sean was attacked when we were

129
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:41,530
meeting Jevan
and those investors.

130
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,570
We need to go to Jevan. No.

131
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,349
Why not? Pointing fingers at

132
00:13:46,373 --> 00:13:48,610
random strangers
will set Sean off.

133
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,650
It's not random.

134
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,450
I'll go to Jevan on my own.

135
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,650
No.

136
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,450
What are you not telling me?

137
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,610
The business that
you helped Finn build,

138
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,392
the people that invested in it,

139
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,290
they want you
to keep running it.

140
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,450
We're agreed on
that, Sean included.

141
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,930
They don't want Sean anywhere
near it, they want him gone -

142
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,290
he's too noisy
and unpredictable.

143
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:17,810
So, what - they tried to
kill him, our investors?

144
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,970
They killed Finn.

145
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:25,130
They killed him because
he was trying to leave.

146
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,250
How... How long have you known?

147
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,290
After Sean was attacked,
I got the truth out of Jevan.

148
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:40,250
<i>A week?
I was thinking things through,</i>

149
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,330
keeping us safe, especially you.

150
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,115
You do know Sean's going crazy,

151
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:45,850
not knowing who attacked him -

152
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,690
Albanians, Pakistanis, Greeks,
Kurds, Chinese?

153
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,638
Telling him now will start a war

154
00:14:50,662 --> 00:14:52,650
<i>we can't win. I
have to tell him.</i>

155
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,650
We don't know who we're
dealing with. I've met them.

156
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:58,234
You've met faces
who work for them.

157
00:14:58,258 --> 00:15:00,610
You keep everything to yourself.

158
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,170
Alex, I am trying
to keep us all alive.

159
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,730
Sean deserves to know. Listen!

160
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,850
Really, what are
you going to do?

161
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:28,010
You are going to tell me...

162
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,370
who you work for.

163
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,710
Only You.

164
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,030
Hey. How's it going?

165
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,550
Hey!

166
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,590
Yeah.

167
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:36,190
You good? Yeah, mm-hm.

168
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,710
Come in. OK.

169
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,750
Please. Yeah, cheers.

170
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,990
<i>Whose place is this?
A guy I see sometimes -</i>

171
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,950
happily married type.

172
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:54,790
Suits me though -
I like the boundaries.

173
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,990
Come on, come on.

174
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:00,270
He's out of the country
for a few months,

175
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,310
and we needed a
place to hide, so...

176
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,390
We've got a few boltholes
like this round the city,

177
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:08,230
<i>for when the wind changes.
Come in.</i>

178
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,750
Plastic?

179
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,910
You got rats? Huh, rats?

180
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,990
Yeah, rats. Look!

181
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,721
Whoa! I didn't take you for a

182
00:19:15,745 --> 00:19:17,630
baker. I need some kind of vice.

183
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,030
Do you want one, have you
had lunch, have you eaten? No.

184
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,030
Erm, looks lovely though.

185
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,790
That's for Baxter.

186
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,470
Who's Baxter?

187
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,990
Right.

188
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,510
Whose dog is that?

189
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:34,350
<i>The waitress who shot at Sean.
We found him in the van.</i>

190
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,070
He hasn't tried to kill
us yet, so, you know.

191
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,702
You find anything
else in the van?

192
00:19:39,726 --> 00:19:42,190
Nothing, not even a fingerprint.

193
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:46,870
<i>You better?
Yeah, thank you, Mrs Wallace.</i>

194
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,990
Thanks for coming. My pleasure.

195
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,110
Good to see you. You too. Good?

196
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,110
<i>Yeah. Let's get
a plate for Elliot.</i>

197
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,630
<i>You're not vegan, are you?
Am I fuck!</i>

198
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,950
<i>Thank God for that.
I'll have anything.</i>

199
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,990
Only You.

200
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:44,110
<i>Hey. It's really nice to
see you at the table, Elliot,</i>

201
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,230
instead of on it.

202
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,350
Yeah, it feels good too.

203
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:55,270
This is lovely, mate, thank
you. Mm. Some wine?

204
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:58,350
Yeah, I'll have a little top-up.

205
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,030
Thank you.

206
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,710
Taking a bullet for me -
why'd you do it?

207
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,510
If you're dead,
I'm out of a job.

208
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:21,270
Or there's part of you that
doesn't want to live.

209
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:25,990
<i>I can't work you out.
What do you want from me?</i>

210
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:32,310
<i>Protection. For Shannon
and Danny - more protection.</i>

211
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,030
That's it?

212
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,550
Done.

213
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,710
Shannon's been
looking after you, yeah?

214
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,750
Who do you think is doing this?

215
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,750
Doesn't point to any
of the gangs we know.

216
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,910
Sean, they got in your house.

217
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,910
You close to your dad, Elliot?

218
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:58,590
Mine would push and push,
show me how to go further,

219
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:02,830
make me go further, do things
I didn't think I could do.

220
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:09,630
<i>You know what? And I mean this
with the utmost respect...</i>

221
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,950
your dad sounds like
a bit of a cunt.

222
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:28,350
And that waitress,
she was clever.

223
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,190
Your mum said there wasn't
a fingerprint in the van.

224
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:36,150
Except dogs have got to
be microchipped,

225
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,470
linking them to their owners.

226
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,355
Now, you got me some good

227
00:22:42,379 --> 00:22:45,190
doctors. You know any good vets?

228
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,710
No, look - I'm sorry, I can't.

229
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,030
Look, I just can't, OK?

230
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,910
Alexander?

231
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,470
He won't leave a message,

232
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:00,590
keeps saying he wants
to talk to Sean face to face.

233
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,270
Elliot is the exception.

234
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:05,910
No-one else can know where
we are, not even the Dumanis.

235
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,830
I know, I get it!

236
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,150
She's military.

237
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:36,230
Danish Special Forces.

238
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,710
Jaeger Corps.

239
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,990
Let's change that dressing.

240
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,230
The baby is due soon.

241
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,710
What do you want?

242
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,870
The money.

243
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,910
It's tomorrow.

244
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,390
Yes?

245
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:55,390
I've told you -

246
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:59,430
you don't get to see a penny
until I know my baby is safe.

247
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,470
She has to live.

248
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,030
Leif!

249
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:31,070
She has to live.

250
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:38,390
I'll go upstairs,
you take the basement.

251
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,830
Felix.

252
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,550
Shit!

253
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,870
Fuck.

254
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:45,110
Fuck! Shit!

255
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,550
Only You.

256
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,990
I loved my husband.

257
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:11,790
And I know he's a lying,
fucking cunt,

258
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,830
and if he was here now,
I'd rip his fucking eyes out,

259
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:17,470
but he's not, and you are.

260
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:27,590
Complete surveillance
on both families.

261
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,350
Who the fuck are these people?

262
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:43,430
Baxter!

263
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,390
Mum, I'm back!

264
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:48,230
Mum?

265
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:51,670
Hello? Hey. How're you doing?

266
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:58,510
<i>Who are you, where's my mum?
Don't worry about that.</i>

267
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:02,670
<i>We're police officers. Your
mum has been reported missing.</i>

268
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,859
What's happened to her? We don't

269
00:32:04,883 --> 00:32:06,790
know, that's why we're here.

270
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,670
You must be Felix, right?

271
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,710
Well, I'm Elliot.

272
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:20,390
Let me help you with your bag,
that looks really heavy.

273
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,830
<i>You been on a trip?
I go to boarding school.</i>

274
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:26,990
<i>Oh, that's nice. And you have
a little sister, don't you?</i>

275
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:31,190
<i>She's coming back today. Why,
am I going to go with you?</i>

276
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,510
No.

277
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,350
Have you got
somebody you can call?

278
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,590
Yeah. Good, good.

279
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:45,470
Just come with me a second.

280
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:48,990
You call that person, your
dad or your aunt, whatever.

281
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,163
I'm going back to
Mum and Billy's.

282
00:32:51,187 --> 00:32:52,910
I'll take you to Shannon's.

283
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,950
I should stay with you.

284
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,990
No, you shouldn't.

285
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:03,070
What happened to the body,
the waitress, that boy's mum?

286
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,071
Wherever they dumped her,

287
00:33:06,095 --> 00:33:08,030
they're never going to find her.

288
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:11,190
How old do you think he was -
like, 11, 12?

289
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:14,230
<i>She tried to kill me.
Yeah, I know, but...</i>

290
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:17,710
Get in the car... DCI Finch.

291
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:06,310
No, no, no - relax.

292
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,950
Sean just sent some
more men round.

293
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,510
Hey.

294
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:17,590
Keep this warm for us, I'll
be in in a second, yeah? Yeah.

295
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,630
So, what, are you official now?

296
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,670
And he gave me to you.

297
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:37,950
We good?

298
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:40,150
Yeah.

299
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,190
Yeah, we're good.

300
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,750
Whatever it takes.

301
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,390
Mum?

302
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,910
Beautiful children.

303
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,670
What...

304
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,390
Mum...

305
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,270
No, no, no.

306
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:09,550
No, please!

307
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:12,110
Who is after us?

308
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,030
Thank you.

309
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,070
What is this place?

310
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,510
How long have you
been watching my family?

311
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:23,230
You obviously
don't fucking listen.

312
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,790
The next one.

313
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,910
Give me the name
of who you work for.

314
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:34,350
You have ten
fucking fingernails,

315
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,490
I'll pull every fucking one of

316
00:37:36,514 --> 00:37:38,910
them out until you
give me a name.

317
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:43,590
If you don't want
your fingernails,

318
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:46,750
what about your children,
do they want them?

319
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:53,110
Give me the name
of who you work for. Alex!

320
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:55,150
Sean! Alex!

321
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,190
SEAN!

322
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,470
Alex, wait!

323
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:04,670
And I thought I'd killed her.

324
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:07,670
We need to find out
who we're fighting.

325
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:12,590
What have you got to tell me
that's so important?

326
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,110
Nothing.

327
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:17,950
<i>Nothing. I just wanted to
make sure you were OK.</i>

328
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:21,070
I didn't want... Just shut up!

329
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:23,430
Alex?

330
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,350
Alex!

331
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:06,530
Only You.

332
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,690
You gave us away...

333
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,810
for that?

334
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,890
Leave off, will
you? Alex is family.

335
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:46,010
And I can't listen to that
shit any longer, I need this.

336
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:50,130
That woman knew the rules when
she came after this family.

337
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:52,810
What rules have
you got down there?

338
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:55,250
Mum knows that
woman isn't going to talk.

339
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,970
Fucking look at yourself!

340
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:59,850
How fucking dare you?

341
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:04,090
<i>Look at me? Look at you,
look at what you're doing!</i>

342
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:09,010
You're a killer too.

343
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:14,370
Yeah, but I did that for you,
didn't I?

344
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:23,370
Never did tell you about that,
did I,

345
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:26,010
Dad's big lesson
with the bucket?

346
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:31,010
The execution of a criminal
who broke the rules, right?

347
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:34,530
<i>Wrong. Ask Mum
what that man really did.</i>

348
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,770
Go on.

349
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,090
Go down there and ask her.

350
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,210
Alexander.

351
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:01,330
Please, come sit.

352
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:07,890
We're very happy to have you
on board and running the ship.

353
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:11,850
Finally we can move the
Wallace business forward.

354
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,530
Alex?

355
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:30,490
Thank you for seeing sense.

356
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:52,450
Give me a name.

357
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:56,690
Give me a name, you bitch,
don't do this.

358
00:41:56,730 --> 00:42:00,890
<i>Give me a fucking name!
Stop, stop, stop!</i>

359
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:02,410
Stop!

360
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:30,130
You've hurt us,
now we've hurt you...

361
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:34,690
but this can end right now.

362
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:39,290
Tell us why you came to kill me,

363
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,330
why you killed my father.

364
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:46,850
Tell us that,
then I will let you go...

365
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:52,650
and I will let your kids
have a mother.

366
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:57,290
I met your son Felix today.

367
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:59,330
Nice boy.

368
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:03,730
I could have brought him here...

369
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:07,130
but he's not done anything to us

370
00:43:07,154 --> 00:43:09,650
and he didn't
choose his parents.

371
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,970
Talk to me...

372
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:18,450
and I'll send you back to them.

373
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:23,770
You know I'm telling the truth.

374
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:37,010
Your mother,
she would never allow that.

375
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:47,370
My mother is not in charge.

376
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:09,170
Only You.

377
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:22,250
If you don't send someone
for her children, I will.

378
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:26,050
<i>Did you not hear me?
We're not killing children!</i>

379
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:28,730
Why not? She tried to kill mine!

380
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:32,730
<i>You never protected us before.
What the fuck does that mean?</i>

381
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,853
Jacqui's always saying it. I

382
00:44:34,877 --> 00:44:37,490
always defended
you, but it's true.

383
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:39,970
You never protected us from Dad.

384
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:43,970
The first man Dad
wanted me to kill,

385
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:47,210
his hands-on tutorial,
you didn't stop that.

386
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:49,175
Billy just let me in on a

387
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:51,770
little secret you kept from me.

388
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:54,610
I want to hear it from you.

389
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,130
Mum...

390
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:59,850
who was he?

391
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,730
He was a no-one in a bar.

392
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:08,170
<i>And you told Dad.
You knew what he would do.</i>

393
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:11,490
I didn't know
he'd asked you to kill him.

394
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:15,890
You always act like Dad was
the one driving everything,

395
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:17,850
that you could never stop him,

396
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:21,010
and the truth is, you
want this life, don't you?

397
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:26,810
Fuck anyone who gets in your
way - no rules, no bargains,

398
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,796
they're just fucking words,

399
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:31,210
words that you
and Dad hid behind

400
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:33,250
to make what you do seem...

401
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:36,250
noble.

402
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:43,570
Everything I do is to protect
this family, everything.

403
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:49,730
Well, stop.

404
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:51,770
We don't need you any more.

405
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:58,450
Only You.

406
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:31,330
Don't let them hurt
my children, please.

407
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:02,930
Kill me if you must...

408
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:08,130
but please leave
my Sofia and Felix.

409
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:11,210
Please?

410
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:24,970
Ed and Alex Dumani.

411
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:30,090
My employers told me
to make sure that...

412
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:32,393
that the hit had to take place

413
00:48:32,417 --> 00:48:34,850
when they were out of the house.

414
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:04,570
Don't make a fucking sound.

415
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:22,050
If you scream,
I'll fucking cut you.

416
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:26,090
OK, OK, there's the door.

417
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,370
Go, go, go!

418
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:32,930
It's locked, it's locked,
it's locked.

419
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,210
Where's the key,
where's the key?

420
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:37,250
The kitchen.

421
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:46,050
Get the key.

422
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,370
Give me the gun.

423
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:02,410
Put it on the counter, slide it.

424
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:22,170
They were told to hit us when
Ed and Alex weren't there.

425
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:23,690
What do you mean?

426
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:27,210
What does he mean?

427
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:36,050
I swear, I'll cut one son
and put a bullet in the other.

428
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:38,410
Don't you fucking move.

429
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:51,690
Put the gun down, Mum.

430
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:59,050
Put the gun down.

431
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:27,770
I'm fine.

432
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:30,810
I'm fine, I'm fine. Jesus!

433
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:32,850
It's OK.

434
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:54,090
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

435
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:56,570
Are you OK? I'm fine, I'm fine.

436
00:53:56,530 --> 00:53:58,010
Oi!

437
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:01,050
The night at the dinner,
you and Ed didn't show.

438
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:04,610
What are you not telling me
about the shooting? Nothing!

439
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:06,490
I told you, we
were running late -

440
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:10,570
meeting some possible
investors. What is this?

441
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:23,330
What, what is it?

442
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:25,970
It's Luan's money.

443
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:29,570
I was waiting for the transfer
to go through, but...

444
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:33,290
the account has
just emptied, it's weird.

445
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:35,535
It looks like a transfer, but it

446
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:37,650
can't be, it must be a glitch.

447
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:39,890
Either that or... Or what?

448
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:47,130
Someone's just stolen
Luan's money.

449
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:49,810
That's half a billion.

450
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:52,570
He'll think it was us.

451
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:03,370
Who would want to start a war
between us and Luan?

452
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:13,010
Enough.

453
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:20,090
Enough!

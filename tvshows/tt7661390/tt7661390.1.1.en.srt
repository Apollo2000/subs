1
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,680
No! I swear down, man.

2
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,040
I told you everything
I know. Fuck!

3
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,440
Please! Please, man!

4
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,680
I don't know anything,
I swear. Please!

5
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,320
We wasn't there long.

6
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,028
Just fucked with some gypo kid's

7
00:00:58,052 --> 00:00:59,640
wheels, that's it. That's all!

8
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,160
That's all! That's all!

9
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,760
You've got to believe me!

10
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,640
No!

11
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,360
No! Ah! Please!

12
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,440
Oh, please!

13
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,280
Please!

14
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,800
I told you,
we ran when we saw the Rolls.

15
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,240
We just got the fuck away
when we saw them.

16
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,280
I wouldn't mess with you, man.

17
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,320
Look at me!

18
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,080
I'm a fucking nobody.

19
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,120
I'm fucking no-one!

20
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,160
<i>No, no! Please!
Please, don't kill me!</i>

21
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,320
Please! Argh!

22
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,040
What else can I do?

23
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,720
No, please!

24
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,960
Please! Please don't kill me!

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,240
No! No, please.

26
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,640
Please! Please.

27
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,440
<i>Did you get it?
Shut the fuck up, man.</i>

28
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,080
Fuck's sake.

29
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,440
So did you get it? Aye.

30
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,920
You gonna do it?

31
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,960
Maybe.

32
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I dunno.

33
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,160
Oi, loan! What the fuck?

34
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,040
Where do you think you're going?

35
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,760
Just off to grab
a couple of cans.

36
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,377
<i>You got my keys?
I won't be long.</i>

37
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:10,000
I'll fill her up on
the way back.

38
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,040
Bring us back a flagon or two
'en. Sure, Patrick, dim probs.

39
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,160
You're buying. The fuck I am!

40
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,440
<i>What you doing? Eh! Do
you want the car or not?</i>

41
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,200
All right, man, all right.

42
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,440
So, did they say who it is?

43
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,280
I told you.

44
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,120
It's just some paedo.

45
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,760
Is three gonna be enough?

46
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,160
I fucking hope so.

47
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,720
You sure you wanna do this?

48
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,800
Ah, fuck.

49
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,520
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

50
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,280
Tell me this prick knows
whose parking space that is.

51
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,871
I'm betting he don't.Well, he's

52
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,320
about to find out, ain't he?

53
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,640
What do you think you're doing?

54
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,040
Oi! Yo!

55
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,080
<i>You blind? Yo! Hey!
What you doing?</i>

56
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,720
Who's that? Oi!

57
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,760
Why so jumpy, cuz? Are you lost?

58
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
Open the door!

59
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,840
I said open the fucking door!

60
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,680
I'm rocking it.

61
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,360
Pop the bonnet.

62
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,600
Shut the fuck up! Just open up!

63
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,760
<i>No, no, please. No! Don't do
anything to the car! Please.</i>

64
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,274
Please. Man, what did I tell

65
00:08:15,298 --> 00:08:17,000
you? Shut up, bro. Fucking hell!

66
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,339
Open the fucking door. Yo,

67
00:08:18,363 --> 00:08:20,040
bounce! Bounce! Bounce! Bounce!

68
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,120
Quick!

69
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,840
Keep it running, Jack.

70
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,840
Shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit.

71
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,480
Shit, shit, shit!

72
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,760
Please pick up, please
pick up, please pick up.

73
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,560
Oh, please pick up.

74
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,080
Please leave
your message after the tone.'

75
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,760
Darren, don't fucking do it.

76
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,400
It ain't who they said.

77
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,040
How you doing, mate?

78
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,280
Yeah, fine, thanks.

79
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,560
The fuck you doing
in Albania, boy?

80
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,800
Soon as my girl comes down,
I'll be on me way.

81
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,840
Always keeps me
waiting, she does.

82
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,680
Girl?

83
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,320
Really?

84
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,760
Went for the car, did she?

85
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,960
Fuck!

86
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,440
Fuck!

87
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,280
Loan!

88
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,320
<i>What the fuck, Darren?
Shut the fucking door!</i>

89
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,280
After you, big man. Thanks.

90
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Uncle Alex!

91
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,560
That's it.

92
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,720
<i>Use your old bedroom.
Mind the boxes.</i>

93
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,960
Good to see you, Marian.

94
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,840
Danny, take this.

95
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,680
Cheers. Cheers.

96
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,800
Yeah, Danny... Danny, don't run.

97
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,240
Danny! Don't run.

98
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,880
Please, please.

99
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,450
Er, dispatch, we have a

100
00:15:20,474 --> 00:15:23,160
hit-and-run currently going on.

101
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,920
Suspect's licence plate is
Alpha - Come on, mate... 62...

102
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,960
Help me out here.

103
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,880
Come here.

104
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,349
Uncle Alex, when was the last

105
00:15:38,373 --> 00:15:39,920
time you and Mummy stayed here?

106
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,840
<i>A long time ago, Danny.
When he was your age.</i>

107
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,160
Grammy Marian says
it's my room now.

108
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,000
<i>Oh, yeah?
Maybe so, but they're my toys.</i>

109
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,440
So don't you go breaking them.

110
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,120
Rightio. All done.

111
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,160
All done.

112
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,880
OK, you're all set.

113
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,520
Go find Grandad.

114
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,160
Grandad?

115
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,880
Really, Alex?

116
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,960
So this is who you are now?

117
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,400
For today at least, until we
know who killed Finn and why.

118
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,360
It doesn't suit you.

119
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,800
This is a bit much.

120
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,960
I know, I know. I understand.

121
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,680
This is how it has to be.

122
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Just doing my job.

123
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,080
Yes, mate. On you go.

124
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,120
Thank you, sir.

125
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,160
Put your arms up for me, please.

126
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,920
Suzie Q.

127
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,800
I thought he'd be pleased.

128
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,920
He wasn't.

129
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,840
Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!

130
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,160
Just let me...

131
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,400
<i>You're looking good, Billy.
You know me.</i>

132
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,440
Always up for a party.

133
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,560
Come on Sean, mate.

134
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,920
I won't go in there pretending
things are OK.Yeah, I know.

135
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,760
I can't shake the hand of
the person that killed him.

136
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,880
No, but I can.

137
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,360
And when we know who it is,
we'll destroy them.

138
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,200
<i>I want the same as you, Sean.
Honest to God, I do.</i>

139
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,080
But we have to
do it the right way.

140
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,760
Not like last night.

141
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,400
Sean, you could burn every kid
from that estate,

142
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,120
but it's not gonna help us
find who murdered your father.

143
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,477
If we don't go in there and

144
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:24,080
convince them that this business

145
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,080
can function as normal, you
can forget finding his killer.

146
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,120
We'll have a war on our hands.

147
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,960
Mm. Maybe.

148
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Let's see.

149
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,720
Alex.

150
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,760
It's time.

151
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,120
Look, Sean, you have my word.

152
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,760
Me and dad, we won't fail him.

153
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,200
Won't fail you either.

154
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,320
We have a lot to cover over
the course of this meeting

155
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,303
and I'm sure you all understand

156
00:21:08,327 --> 00:21:09,800
how busy Sean is today.

157
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,320
He thanks you all for coming.

158
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,040
And we would like to
thank you for your patience

159
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,880
over the course
of this last week.

160
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,920
Our patience isn't infinite, Ed.

161
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,360
Some of us still have cargo
ships anchored out at sea.

162
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,600
I take it we can expect
something in return

163
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,960
for the losses we have
incurred? Yes? No.

164
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,858
You have a box
of silicone pussies

165
00:21:31,882 --> 00:21:33,600
doing laps of the Indian Ocean.

166
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,440
I have 80 kilos of product
sitting in the docks.

167
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,560
With respect, I just want
to know where we stand.

168
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,560
We shut everything down
because we needed to.

169
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,272
But more importantly because

170
00:21:45,296 --> 00:21:47,400
someone chose
to kill Finn Wallace.

171
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,840
<i>We're all partners here.
We rely on each other.</i>

172
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,560
The system works,
as long as you comply.

173
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,950
Now, you all know
me well enough to

174
00:21:56,974 --> 00:21:59,280
know I will find
out who did this.

175
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,920
And when I do...

176
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,840
Well, I think you all know
exactly what will happen.

177
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,661
Over the last week we have put

178
00:22:07,685 --> 00:22:09,720
into place a
system for transition

179
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,878
and by dawn we
will have the docks

180
00:22:11,902 --> 00:22:13,920
back open and fully operational.

181
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,560
Our investors have
given us the green light

182
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,400
to proceed on
our established terms.

183
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,080
So, as long as
things stay quiet,

184
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,600
the government won't have
a reason to make a sound.

185
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,400
I've personally liaised
with our contact at the police

186
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,400
to renegotiate
protection for you all.

187
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,737
Each and every one of
your deals, every detail

188
00:22:29,761 --> 00:22:32,080
that Finn carried in his
head, I have in mine.

189
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,573
Lale, your smack money will be

190
00:22:33,597 --> 00:22:35,120
laundered in time to send home.

191
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,880
Wong, your cargo
will arrive as usual.

192
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,360
Nasir, your father's
trade routes are secure.

193
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,120
But remember this.

194
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,440
Whoever stood
to profit from Finn's death,

195
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,800
the numbers will lead
us to you soon enough.

196
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,920
They never lie.

197
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,680
Once again, I'd like to
thank you all for coming.

198
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,600
I'm so sorry, mate.

199
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,680
As I was saying,

200
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,560
we would like to thank you all
for coming.

201
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,200
Today we mourn the
loss of a great man,

202
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,040
but tomorrow it will
be business as usual.

203
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,720
No.

204
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,720
The tap stays off.

205
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,560
Sean -Nothing gets brought in.

206
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,280
Nothing gets shipped out.

207
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,120
No dirty money is washed.

208
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,560
No-one sells a fucking gram
on those streets.

209
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,480
Everything stops...

210
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,120
until I find out who killed him.

211
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,120
We're Going Wrong.

212
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,400
Not today, Billy, please.

213
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,200
<i>Think about it. When business
stops, people stop talking.</i>

214
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,694
Keep the gates open, the sooner

215
00:26:11,718 --> 00:26:13,240
my dealers will hear something -

216
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,101
And the sooner you
start making money

217
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:16,920
and forget my
father was killed. No.

218
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,960
The only business
that's going to get done

219
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
will be finding out
who pulled the trigger.

220
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,700
Don't think I won't watch all of

221
00:26:22,724 --> 00:26:24,560
you starve until I
get that answer.

222
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,880
You act like it's not
obvious who was involved.

223
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,320
Your father was killed
in one of Luan's buildings,

224
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,760
and his driver disappeared on
Albanian territory!

225
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,400
We are dealing
with the Albanians.

226
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,240
<i>Yet still you punish us.
We're your business partners.</i>

227
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,240
<i>You're my customers.
Luan is co-operating, OK?</i>

228
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,880
The Albanians are trying to
find out as much as they can.

229
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,720
While he stays away, we all
suffer?

230
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,440
Who is in charge
here, Ed? Sean is.

231
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,840
And he's made himself clear.

232
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,485
If you want access
to our business,

233
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:54,840
you'll hunt down
my father's killer.

234
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,440
I'm sure he's not that far away.

235
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,400
OK, thank you, everyone,
leave it with me.

236
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,080
We'll see you at the church.

237
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,680
Thank you.

238
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,160
Nasir...

239
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,640
please tell Asif this won't
affect our arrangement.

240
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,720
Alex, I've come to pay
my respects, nothing more.

241
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,309
Look, whatever that was, it's

242
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:47,120
between you and
my father, not me.

243
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,760
I wasn't here. I heard nothing.

244
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,560
Have the car pick
us up from the back.

245
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,840
Don't worry about it, mate,
I've got it.

246
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,440
United Nations in here today.

247
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,400
Fuck me, Elliot!

248
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,040
What were you hoping for?

249
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,280
That they'd ask you
to carry the coffin.

250
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,320
Piss off, Jim.

251
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,800
Loads of people out there,
crowd control and that.

252
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,640
Yeah, well, they're all
in here now so stay put.

253
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,120
It's a funeral,
not a job interview.

254
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,560
Suit and tie can't hide
a washed-up squaddie,

255
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,600
no matter how hard you try.

256
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,520
Know your place.

257
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,600
Oh! Things are looking up.

258
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,440
They're about to bury your boss.

259
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,640
20 years of service
and I never even met the man.

260
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,285
The money you just skimmed from

261
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:50,920
me, buy us both
a drink, will you?

262
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,960
And put the rest back.

263
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,960
<i>Any update on Jack?
No, nothing yet.</i>

264
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,880
No-one's seen or heard of
him since Finn was killed.

265
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,640
He's just his fucking driver.

266
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,360
You don't think he -No.

267
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,200
We don't.

268
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,760
Jevan. Good of you to come.

269
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,320
<i>Of course. They send their
condolences. Thank you.</i>

270
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,360
This way.

271
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,280
Very sorry for your loss.

272
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,320
<i>Would you...? Would you please
excuse me? Of course.</i>

273
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,600
Family pew is at the front
of the church. Please join us.

274
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,280
No.

275
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,120
Well, if not for me,
for your father.

276
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,400
That's rich, Marian.

277
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,320
Mum -No, not now.

278
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,680
Think they'll be OK?

279
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,320
<i>Dad's dead.
They're in the same room.</i>

280
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,160
What do you think?

281
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,360
Come on, Jacs,
come to the front.

282
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,040
Don't start, Sean.

283
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,680
Mum's just had a go.

284
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,720
Jacqueline,
for the both of us, please.

285
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,440
It'll be OK.

286
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,200
I'll sit between you.

287
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,600
If we can get
one good thing out of today...

288
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,960
Come on.

289
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,400
Thank you.

290
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,040
Pub's this way, lads.

291
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,400
Get them fucking
cars off the road.

292
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,440
Come on, let's buy you a drink.

293
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,640
Detective.

294
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,960
CCTV from the night
Finn was killed.

295
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,240
Make sure your dad knows
it came from me.

296
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,840
Luan, is this wise?

297
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,680
Edward, I must say,
I was a bit surprised

298
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,066
not to be invited to such an

299
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,600
important meeting this morning.

300
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,177
Well, you weren't invited to the

301
00:35:48,201 --> 00:35:49,760
church either, but here you are.

302
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,680
I'm here to pay my respects,
the same as everyone.

303
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,360
But, more importantly,

304
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,551
I want to know that our

305
00:35:55,575 --> 00:35:57,360
agreement will
still be honoured.

306
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,800
Your agreement died with Finn.

307
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,240
If you need
anything, let me know.

308
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,880
Thank you.

309
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,270
I stuck to my side of the deal.

310
00:36:19,294 --> 00:36:21,160
I did what was asked of me.

311
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,920
I don't know what you had on
him, but now is not the time.

312
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,360
I decide when, I decide where.

313
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,600
<i>Not you. What the
fuck is he doing here?</i>

314
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,750
Sean, we've never been properly

315
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:32,440
introduced, Luan Dushaj.

316
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,701
At moments like these, I know

317
00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:42,520
the fingers are quick to point.

318
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,160
Yeah, and they're only
pointing in one direction.

319
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,440
I can assure you,
we had no hand in his death.

320
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,880
<i>But we'll find answers.
Look forward to it.</i>

321
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,594
Now grab a hymn
book, take a seat,

322
00:36:52,618 --> 00:36:54,120
and pay your fucking respects.

323
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,080
Fucking nerve on
them, coming here.

324
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,085
You know, I offered to send a

325
00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:35,360
couple of boys
to Little Albania.

326
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,600
<i>Make it right.
That's nice of you.</i>

327
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,720
Well, I say I offered...

328
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,400
I thought about it.

329
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,720
It's the thought
that counts, Jim.

330
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,280
All right, Bes?

331
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,840
Are we good? Ish.

332
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,960
Hey, I have nothing to hide.

333
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,640
That's good.

334
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,480
Still, your lot really
shouldn't be here.

335
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,160
Oh, is that so?

336
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,240
<i>Jog on, mate.
You're blocking the sun.</i>

337
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,200
Elliot, seriously?

338
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,440
So why did you kill Finn?

339
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,200
That wasn't mine. Jim!

340
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,920
You gonna let this
fucking prick bark at me?

341
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,200
The fuck, Jim?

342
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,240
We're here to keep the peace,
Elliot.

343
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,960
No matter the cunt.

344
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,640
Heel.

345
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,920
Fuck off, you prick.

346
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,640
To Finn Wallace!

347
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,160
No blacks.

348
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,080
No Irish.

349
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:30,560
A city of closed doors
brought us together,

350
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,800
united us.

351
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,880
That's how Finn and I started
working together.

352
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:44,040
Finn came over
as a 12-year-old immigrant.

353
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:48,680
Er, we met as young teenagers
on the streets of London.

354
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,080
"You and me,
we're just the same..."

355
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,000
That's what he said to me.

356
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,920
Illegitimate bastard children
of the great British Empire.

357
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,960
We made an agreement,
by the time we were done,

358
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,720
there would not be
one single door in this city

359
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,760
that we could not get behind.

360
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,800
He led.

361
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,720
I followed.

362
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,687
And I am so proud to have worked

363
00:40:19,711 --> 00:40:21,720
for the man all
these long years.

364
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,240
When I lost my...

365
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,640
When I lost my wife, Ayana...

366
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:43,160
it was Finn and Marian who
shielded Shannon and Alexander

367
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,920
from the pain of
watching their mother fade.

368
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,240
They...

369
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,440
They are my family.

370
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:01,760
And so I say to you,
Marian, Sean, Jackie, Billy...

371
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:08,200
I dedicate
my heart and soul to you.

372
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,200
This is from
the back of the building.

373
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,040
Watch!

374
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,520
That's Jack.

375
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,880
Finn's driver. He's still alive.

376
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,360
If we find them, we find him.

377
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,400
Play it back.

378
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,720
Who the fuck are you? Elliot.

379
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,440
<i>I work for Jim.
Who the fuck's Jim?</i>

380
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,280
Nobody, just play it back,
I think I recognise that van.

381
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,520
<i>That's Besmir. Eh?
One of Luan's boys.</i>

382
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,160
You just walked him across the
street.

383
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,120
He's wearing the same fucking
jacket.

384
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,920
He's in the pub downing shots.

385
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,640
Are you sure about this? Yeah.

386
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,298
Broken rear tail
light, passenger

387
00:42:41,322 --> 00:42:42,720
side. Dent above the bumper.

388
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,760
It's his van. It's Besmir.

389
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,880
Right, you go over there, show
him who you're talking about.

390
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,557
That's all. Nothing more.Course.

391
00:42:50,581 --> 00:42:52,240
Don't let him out of your sight.

392
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,800
If he leaves, you follow,
but low-key, unseen.

393
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,480
Understood?

394
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,720
Mark, do not fuck this up.

395
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,040
Right, let's take
this fucker out.

396
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,080
<i>Make sure my path is clear.
Wait, Alexander said -</i>

397
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,200
Fuck that office boy,
he's out of his depth.

398
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,691
We'll take him straight to Sean

399
00:43:08,715 --> 00:43:10,280
<i>ourselves. This
is not supposed -</i>

400
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,600
Either stay down or fuck off.

401
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,840
I know what an
Albanian looks like.

402
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,120
Right, which one of you...

403
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,520
Where the fuck's Besmir?

404
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,320
Where the fuck's Besmir?

405
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,760
Besmir!

406
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,600
Come here.

407
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,320
No.

408
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,720
Come here.

409
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,400
<i>Where is he? Where's Jack?
I swear I don't know.</i>

410
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,040
Fuck off, you were seen!

411
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:42,640
Your van arrived very quickly,
scooped him up.

412
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,240
Fuck you, Elliot.

413
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,866
We can keep playing
games, but I've

414
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:47,320
got orders to take you to Sean.

415
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,240
So who would you
rather talk to? Me or him?

416
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,240
Wait, wait!

417
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,160
We were out picking up score,
we heard gun shots.

418
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,320
I get a call, shit's going
down - we jus turned up to it.

419
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,720
I swear we didn't expect
to find what we did.

420
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,547
So why didn't you
take Jack back to the.

421
00:48:06,571 --> 00:48:08,560
<i>Wallaces, huh? We
wouldn't fucking be here!</i>

422
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,960
Fucking Sean would kill me
on his own doorstep.

423
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,200
That driver didn't wake up
for days.

424
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:16,240
He's the only one to
say I didn't kill Finn,

425
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,920
and when he - when he
does wake, he don't say shit.

426
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,080
I tried telling Luan at the
church, but we were sent away.

427
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,720
What else I do? Wait! Wait!

428
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,880
Jack's awake?

429
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,720
Take me to him.

430
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,080
Elliot, you have
no fucking idea.

431
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,720
Take me!

432
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,040
Finn Wallace may be gone.

433
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,080
But I still see him
everywhere I go.

434
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,560
Look around.

435
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,200
You'll see him too.

436
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,880
I could hear him as you all
filed in and took your seats.

437
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,320
He lives on in the murmurs
of a thousand languages,

438
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,080
each telling their
story of how...

439
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,600
Finn Wallace was able
to change their life.

440
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:31,480
His story is forever carved
into the skyline of this city.

441
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,320
A city he transformed into his
likeness.

442
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,960
And I miss the man.

443
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,840
I miss him.

444
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,600
More than
any amount of words can say.

445
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,949
His smile alone
would've washed away

446
00:49:50,973 --> 00:49:52,600
the silence that
fills this room.

447
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,160
Finn Wallace.

448
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,560
Dad.

449
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,160
He believed in people.

450
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,623
He believed in giving

451
00:50:09,647 --> 00:50:11,560
opportunities to
the disadvantaged.

452
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,920
He gave.

453
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,760
He supported.

454
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,480
He did so much for all of us.

455
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,600
All of you.

456
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:36,160
My father was taken from us on
the streets of London.

457
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,040
And now London will deliver
to us those that took him.

458
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,080
Finn Wallace.

459
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,120
He's still here.

460
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,880
He's in me.

461
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,360
Ghetto.

462
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,120
Almost there.

463
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,480
You two stay here.

464
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,480
Where are we going?

465
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,160
That way.

466
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,360
That way. Go!

467
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,920
Come on.

468
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,480
Here.

469
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,600
You've been keeping him here?

470
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,320
Would anyone have looked?

471
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,880
Move.

472
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,120
We've just come
to collect someone.

473
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,840
Nothing more.

474
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,560
Tell them.

475
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,400
Come on.

476
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,200
Open the door!

477
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,480
Tell him!

478
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,956
He's in much better
shape now than

479
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:25,920
when we picked him up, trust me.

480
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,360
<i>Can you walk?
Who the fuck are you?</i>

481
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,091
I'm gonna take
you to the Wallaces.

482
00:54:37,115 --> 00:54:38,400
Come on. Let's get you up.

483
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,000
Make sure you tell Sean
we took care of him.

484
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,840
I didn't know what went down...

485
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,880
Don't recognise you.

486
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,640
No reason to.

487
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,520
Elliot.

488
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,200
You, you must be Jack.

489
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,640
A lot of people have
been looking for you.

490
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,920
I had no knowledge you
were being held in here.

491
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,640
But here you are, still alive.

492
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,960
You came so far.

493
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,640
And I trust you can find
your way safely back.

494
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,000
Please...

495
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,320
Elliot, don't ever come
to my place of business

496
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,680
brandishing a weapon again.

497
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,760
I just came for
him. And I let you.

498
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,800
Make that clear
when you take him back.

499
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,120
Oh, God.

500
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,120
Mind your head.

501
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,360
What the fuck has
happened to him? Just go!

502
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,000
Oi!

503
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:11,240
Oh, fucking, fucking Jesus.

504
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,280
Oh, God!

505
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,080
<i>Jack. Jack, tell
me what you know.</i>

506
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,720
I fucked up, man.

507
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,400
Yeah? I should've...

508
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,840
What happened? Who killed him?

509
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,520
Jack?

510
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,280
Kids.

511
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,200
Fucking nobodies, man.

512
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,920
Fucking nobodies.

513
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,240
In some...

514
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,120
Red Nova. Mm-hmm?

515
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,600
Yes?

516
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:58,040
G-four... four-three...

517
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:01,320
OK, yeah, Red Nova G443...

518
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:04,680
S-A-V.

519
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,000
<i>We should leave.
Should we leave?</i>

520
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,520
<i>Darren?
All right, I don't know, OK!</i>

521
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,680
Look, they have
to know it was us.

522
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,800
And if they don't by now,
your dad will.

523
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:27,240
We got enough here to lay low,
just have to wait.

524
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,080
For how long?

525
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,578
I mean, it's not like you just

526
00:58:30,602 --> 00:58:32,320
fucking forget
something like that.

527
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,848
Call 'em again. Look, they might

528
00:58:33,872 --> 00:58:35,520
be able to do
something to help us.

529
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:38,160
I keep tellin' you,
it's a dead line.

530
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,200
They fucked us.

531
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,840
We're on our own.

532
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,560
Oh, bollocks, he's leaking.

533
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,200
Grab us a towel, will you?

534
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,240
Fucking boys! Where you off to?

535
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,880
Jesus Christ!

536
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,560
No, no, no, please, no!

537
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,400
No, no!

538
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,040
Fuck!

539
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,720
Where's your fucking brother?

540
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,040
Cos I heard he had
a fucking pistol on him

541
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,722
and he and my boy went and put a

542
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,360
bullet in some Albanian nobody.

543
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,200
Now I ain't seen either since.

544
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,892
But I know they're
not in hiding,

545
00:59:48,916 --> 00:59:50,640
cos of some fucking
dead Albanian.

546
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:52,397
I swear, I don't know anything.

547
00:59:52,421 --> 00:59:54,160
Well, that makes two of us now.

548
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,800
Dad!

549
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,520
Loan, he asked if
he could borrow her.

550
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:07,040
I swear to God, I don't know
anything. Please don't.

551
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,280
Find 'em! Both of 'em!

552
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,200
I want Luan.

553
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:36,280
Right here, on his knees,
explaining himself.

554
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:38,520
His men took Jack,
and I want to know why.

555
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,280
Sean, just stop, stop.

556
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:44,000
Dragging Luan across the city
now makes us look desperate.

557
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,840
We have got to play this right.

558
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:49,080
I have the entire city
looking for his killer.

559
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:51,600
We are making enemies out of
business partners.

560
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:54,440
And the longer that goes on,
the sooner they turn on us.

561
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,680
We've got to find a peaceful
solution to this.

562
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,720
Did you see my
dad's face in there?

563
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,600
I'm not interested in peace.

564
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,000
Marian, talk to your boy.

565
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,480
I agree with Sean.

566
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,972
Whoever killed my husband

567
01:01:16,996 --> 01:01:19,000
remains an enemy to this family.

568
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,760
If we back down now,
they'll walk all over us.

569
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,040
It's not about - Enough. Enough!

570
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,840
All of you.

571
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,440
Our strength lies in our unity.

572
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,800
That's what your
dad built for us.

573
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,560
Listen, son.

574
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:45,360
I want nothing more than
to bring you the head of

575
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:49,120
whoever the hell had
the guts to do this to us.

576
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:54,560
But, in that meeting, this
morning, you acted alone.

577
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,480
And that makes us
look weak and divided.

578
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,520
Work with me, Sean,

579
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,960
and I promise you
I will give you everything,

580
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
just like I did for your father.

581
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:12,120
I'm glad to hear it.

582
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,306
<i>Jack! Take your
fucking hands off</i>

583
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:19,760
him! Get him in the boardroom!

584
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,520
Watch out.

585
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,560
I'm so fucking sorry.

586
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,240
<i>Get him outside!
No, no. He stays.</i>

587
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:28,480
Come on, Jack.

588
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:30,560
<i>Come on, Jack, it's OK.
Get a doctor.</i>

589
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,320
Get a doctor!

590
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:35,160
<i>Come on, Jack.
Come on, Jack, it's OK.</i>

591
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,440
Fuck!

592
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,200
<i>How's he doing in there?
He passed out.</i>

593
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,440
<i>Yeah, he does that a lot.
Who the fuck are you?</i>

594
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,879
It's OK, he's one of ours. He's

595
01:02:55,903 --> 01:02:57,280
the twat that tore up the pub.

596
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,720
<i>Elliot. I'm the one
who found him.</i>

597
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,960
You did all of that on your own?

598
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,240
What was it? Six of them? Eight.

599
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,960
But I had a dart, so...

600
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,880
If he wanted to, Luan could've
killed us there and then.

601
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,600
Easily.

602
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,520
<i>Doctor gave him a shot. He'll
be out until the morning.</i>

603
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,240
Take him back to his flat,
he needs rest.

604
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:39,680
Let him sleep it off, we'll
grill him in the morning.

605
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:44,320
Sean. Trust me.

606
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,840
It's a good thing
you didn't need it.

607
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,680
Get on your knees.Sean.

608
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,440
No, I don't buy it.

609
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:56,120
<i>Luan gave Jack back to us.
That has to mean something.</i>

610
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,560
<i>No, no, no. He
sent you, didn't he?</i>

611
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:02,400
<i>What? No. No, I work for Jim.
I work for you.</i>

612
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:04,283
You expect me to
believe some street

613
01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:05,920
grunt can do what you just did?

614
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,280
We spent a week searching the
city. You find him in a day!

615
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:12,120
<i>It's bullshit.
You're a fucking wooden horse.</i>

616
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,760
Go on, then, cut me open.

617
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:16,640
Don't even...

618
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,404
I'm my father's
son, and I will take

619
01:04:18,428 --> 01:04:20,080
a fucking belt
sander to your eyes

620
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:22,320
<i>if you don't start talking.
Fuck off!</i>

621
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:24,440
Shit I've been through today,
for you.

622
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,880
Risked my life to drag
that dizzy cunt to your door

623
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,640
and you put
a fucking gun to my head?

624
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:30,320
Fuck you!

625
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:34,000
You done?

626
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,760
He saw who did it.

627
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,600
Jack.

628
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,720
He saw who killed your father.

629
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,760
He said...

630
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,880
He said it was
a couple of pikey kids.

631
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,720
<i>Are you fucking high? I'm
just telling you what he said.</i>

632
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:57,400
<i>What else?
He gave me a number plate.</i>

633
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:03,520
I swear to God, if any of this
is fucking bullshit -

634
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,160
Yeah, yeah, belt
sander, I get it

635
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:09,200
but when you find out
this is true...

636
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,960
I work for you.

637
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,440
Not Jim. Not even fucking Mark.

638
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:20,280
You.

639
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,240
Right.

640
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:41,680
Make it known, I want everyone
searching for these fuckers.

641
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:45,400
I don't care if they work for
us or they're paid off by us,

642
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,040
they join the hunt.

643
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,360
It's Elliot, right?

644
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,400
That includes you.

645
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,520
Dad?

646
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,520
Elliot? Give us a second.

647
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,443
Make you a cup
of tea first. Carer

648
01:06:41,467 --> 01:06:43,480
made me a fresh
one before she left.

649
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,320
Oh, yeah?

650
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,560
When was that? A month ago?

651
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,960
It's got more skin on it
than Auntie Joan.

652
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:54,440
Nah, it's all right,
I don't need another one.

653
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:15,640
Oh, er, Sally said she might
not be able to come next week.

654
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,680
Says it's not up to her.

655
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:19,720
Don't you worry about that.

656
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,080
She'll be here.

657
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:34,000
That should do you
a couple of weeks in advance.

658
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,960
I might not be able to pop in
next week. Work's picking up.

659
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,040
I'm sure a week
late is fine, son.

660
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,080
Yeah but, you
know, just in case.

661
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:56,120
Thing is, I might not be able
to make it in for a while.

662
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:01,080
Just remember to give
that to her tomorrow, right?

663
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,440
Right, let me see 'em.

664
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,200
Elliot -Come on, put them up.

665
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,120
That's it, Champ.

666
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,800
You know, Social's fine, boy.

667
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,200
I'm not completely incapable,
you know.

668
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,960
I know you're not, Dad.

669
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
But no Sally on Social...

670
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,440
She's taken a shine to you.

671
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:30,080
Am I gonna have to tell her
you wanna break her heart?

672
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:32,920
Ah, she's just a fine kid,
that's all.

673
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,560
Reminds me of Naomi.

674
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:44,040
You can't run away
from it forever, you know.

675
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:51,680
Right, that's you done.

676
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,480
Going down in
the fourth tonight?

677
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,520
Elliot. Or is it the third?

678
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,160
It was usually one or the other.

679
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,600
Hardly broke a sweat
some nights did you, Dad?

680
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,520
I'm sorry.

681
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,760
I'm sorry, that was...

682
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,480
I'll watch a bit of telly with
you, before you go to bed.

683
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,360
Loan?

684
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,360
Is that you?

685
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,000
Please, loan.

686
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,640
Where are you, boy?

687
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:31,280
Pat...

688
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:35,160
I'm sorry about your car.

689
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,800
Fuck sake, forget about
the car, you useless prick.

690
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,880
We fucked up.

691
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,840
What were you thinkin'?

692
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,680
We didn't know, I swear.

693
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,720
I really did try to stop it.

694
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,360
The fuck are we gonna do, Pat?

695
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,920
Darren says we've gotta
lay low while we wait it out.

696
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:00,840
There is no layin' low,
man was too big for that.

697
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,560
We didn't know it'd be him.

698
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:04,400
We just did it for the money.

699
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:09,800
Please...

700
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,160
tell me where you are.

701
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,680
Let me help you.

702
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:20,160
Saint Ralph's,
by the train tracks.

703
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,000
Fifth floor.

704
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:29,280
I love you, Pat.

705
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:31,320
Just wait till I'm there, OK?

706
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,000
I'm so sorry.

707
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:32,120
Open the fuckin' door.

708
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:35,800
<i>Open the fuckin' door!
Look, I'm sorry!</i>

709
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:38,440
I know you're in there, Darren.

710
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,360
Do what I say,
and open this fuckin' door!

711
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:48,760
Fuck you! Fuck all of you!

712
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:56,040
<i>He was gonna leave it.
All right. Fuck off.</i>

713
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,657
Loan did it to himself. Yeah, he

714
01:16:57,681 --> 01:16:59,280
saved his own though, didn't he?

715
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:00,960
Blood's blood.

716
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,600
And so's mine.

717
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:05,440
What are you gonna do?

718
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:07,080
Take on Kinney?

719
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,720
Didn't think so.

720
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,390
Your father'd beat
you worse than

721
01:17:10,414 --> 01:17:11,920
he did, for talkin' like that.

722
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,349
He's no father of mine. No dad

723
01:17:13,373 --> 01:17:14,920
would let that
happen to his boy!

724
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,560
You'd do right
to be glad he let you live.

725
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,240
Now bag up the money.

726
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,320
All right, hands up.

727
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:40,080
Nice and slow.

728
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:53,360
Step back for us.

729
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:58,360
I said, step back, please.

730
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,840
No.

731
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:57,680
Fuck.

732
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:26,560
The other one in the car...

733
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:30,360
where are they taking him?

734
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,600
No!

735
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:29,960
<i>I needed that address.
And we got it to you.</i>

736
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,600
I needed it sooner.

737
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:34,280
Elliot,
what the fuck have you done?

738
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,200
I had no choice.

739
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,040
I got there too late
to save the boy.

740
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,400
They took the other one
before I even got here.

741
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,280
Hey. Hey!

742
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:46,120
<i>Two years undercover.
Have I ever fucked you over?</i>

743
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:53,720
<i>We have an opportunity here.
In the space of a day,</i>

744
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:56,040
I've gone from being a nobody
outside that church

745
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:57,960
to being invited
into their home.

746
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,840
Sean Wallace himself
calling me by name,

747
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:04,280
tasking me to find the guy who
killed his father!

748
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Belize dollars, fuck ton of it,

749
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,040
more than anyone
would pay two kids.

750
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,720
It might be something.

751
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:15,440
Or it might be nothing.

752
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,120
It's too late.

753
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,909
They want you out
and I am running

754
01:24:19,933 --> 01:24:21,400
out of ideas to keep you in.

755
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,960
<i>We haven't delivered.
But now we can.</i>

756
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:29,600
Vick, don't make this
all be for nothing.

757
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,240
They're clean.

758
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,480
Thank you.

759
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:38,680
Head west.

760
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:40,320
To Evie.

761
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,097
She'll have a boat waiting once

762
01:25:42,121 --> 01:25:43,880
they get tired of tracking him.

763
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,960
I'm not sorry.

764
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Cos I'm not the
one who should be.

765
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,720
One day, you'll understand.

766
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,240
Say nothing to no-one.

767
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,880
You hear?

768
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:08,880
Watch over him, Mal, for me.

769
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,560
Of course.

770
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:48,720
OK, boss.

771
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,640
Who's there?

772
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:41,280
Jesus, fuck, Ed.

773
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,960
Oh, man I thought you were...

774
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Good to have you back with us,
Jack.

775
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:49,720
Thank you.

776
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:09,120
<i>They found money on him.
On his body.</i>

777
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,400
Yeah.

778
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,440
Yeah, he had a bag of it on him.

779
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:24,120
I'm tired, Jack.

780
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:29,000
I'm tired of being the one
holding all of this together.

781
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,480
Look, Ed...

782
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:38,280
sooner or later,
they're gonna find out.

783
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,440
About her, about all
of this and - Jack...

784
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:42,960
They're not gonna hear from
me. Do you understand me?

785
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,480
They're not gonna hear it
from me, not one word but...

786
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:49,600
Fuck, man, when they do know,

787
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:52,640
they're gonna wanna know why
I didn't tell them.

788
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:54,360
Look, I guess I just...

789
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:59,160
I just wanna make sure that
I'm in the clear is all, Ed.

790
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:00,800
You know?

791
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:03,920
<i>Where were you taking him?
Later? What was the plan?</i>

792
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
I don't know.

793
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:10,840
Yeah, you do.

794
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:15,200
<i>I took... I took a fucking car
to the body, man.</i>

795
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:17,240
I didn't do nothing wrong.

796
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,400
No-one is gonna think that.

797
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:23,480
OK? No-one.

798
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:26,880
Trust me.

799
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:35,000
Ed...

800
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:39,040
<i>I can't move.
I can't move my arm.</i>

801
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:43,080
I know.

802
01:30:58,120 --> 01:30:59,920
No.

803
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:03,560
No, please. Ed, no!

804
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:07,240
Please, no. No.

805
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:10,440
No.

806
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:30,200
Believe me,
I take no enjoyment in this.

807
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:33,360
I wish I didn't have to do it.

808
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,200
But I do.

809
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:38,680
The truth is I haven't

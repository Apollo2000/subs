1
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,656
I'm looking at a lot of faces

2
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,640
on my wall. 
Someone is missing.

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,382
It's not just Luan's
money that's

4
00:00:18,406 --> 00:00:20,080
gone. Three more empty accounts.

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,600
It's over a billion and a
half. It's Finn Wallace.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,640
He fucked us all.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,760
You don't get to see a penny
until I know my baby's safe.

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,880
Whoever took your money
took ours as well.

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,920
Mosi won't wait any longer.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,400
The attack on Lale, that
was your blunt hand, yes?

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,440
That was my strong hand.

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,480
What do you want to do?

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,520
Take what he most cherishes.

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,640
There's someone
else above all this.

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,654
We need to figure
out who it is. Our

16
00:00:46,678 --> 00:00:49,160
investors killed Finn
because he was leaving.

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,800
They are prepared to let the
business continue

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,320
on condition that Alexander
runs the Wallace organisation.

19
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,942
Why the fuck have you got a UC

20
00:00:56,966 --> 00:00:58,880
<i>following me? I
need him pulled out.</i>

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,761
I don't care who
he works for. I'll

22
00:01:00,785 --> 00:01:02,440
set him up, you can arrest him.

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,600
If I ever see you again,
I'll kill you!

24
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,640
Now take your
scumbag father away.

25
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,280
I don't want you going near
Shannon Dumani ever again.

26
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,320
Understood? It's you and me now.

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,360
They'll come after you.

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,080
OK.

29
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,760
<i>Yes? The Wallaces,
they're on the run.</i>

30
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Shannon?

31
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,840
Shannon? It's me.

32
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,720
Looking for somewhere to hide?

33
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,362
I thought you were going to take

34
00:04:14,386 --> 00:04:15,960
root out there in those bushes.

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I came to see Shannon.

36
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,381
I wanted to tell her why I

37
00:04:19,405 --> 00:04:21,240
didn't leave with
her last night.

38
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,600
<i>I had to stay.
Sean was all over the place -</i>

39
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,640
I am very good
at reading people.

40
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,680
It's what's kept
me alive. But you?

41
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I don't get you.

42
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,040
Everybody has to like you.

43
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,080
You never seem to pick a side.

44
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,000
I just came to see that
Shannon and Danny were OK.

45
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,720
<i>They're fine.
Where are Sean and Marian?</i>

46
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,760
I don't know.

47
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,800
And Billy?

48
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,520
I'm going to pick
a side for you.

49
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,760
And it's not the side I'm on.

50
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,240
Key.

51
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,920
Go back upstairs
and look after Danny.

52
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,440
<i>Our job is very simple.
To find the money.</i>

53
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,445
We can do that. We're good at

54
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:09,720
<i>hiding it. We
know where to look.</i>

55
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,104
And one thing I can
tell you for certain is

56
00:06:12,128 --> 00:06:14,440
that Finn Wallace
didn't take it with him.

57
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,480
This firm is not going under.

58
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,800
Confidence is what
will see us through.

59
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,960
And I have total confidence
in each and every one of you.

60
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,372
Find that money,
it will convince

61
00:06:24,396 --> 00:06:26,720
our investors and everyone else.

62
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,760
Yeah? Thank you.

63
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,075
Yes. Yes, I can assure you

64
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,600
<i>that's all happening.
Absolutely.</i>

65
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,320
100%, yeah.

66
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,280
OK.

67
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,320
Thank you.

68
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,080
Do you know how I spend
all my time now?

69
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,120
All of it.

70
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,620
It's convincing people
that not only should

71
00:07:07,644 --> 00:07:09,920
your son be allowed
to run the business,

72
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,960
that he should
even be kept alive.

73
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Same goes for you,

74
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,040
your daughter,

75
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,080
your grandson.

76
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,120
And you?

77
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,750
If anyone can find where Finn

78
00:07:25,774 --> 00:07:27,280
hid that money, it's Alexander.

79
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,320
Recovering the money
is the first thing, Ed!

80
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,440
What the investors want is an
assurance of order.

81
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,531
No more dead bodies on the

82
00:07:32,555 --> 00:07:34,040
street, no more
chaos. Confidence!

83
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,960
<i>And we can give you that.
Once Sean is out of the way.</i>

84
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,308
There must be
somewhere... There must

85
00:07:48,332 --> 00:07:50,560
be somewhere that
they would hide out!

86
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,120
You know, not knowing
where Sean is...

87
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
I wouldn't stand out here.

88
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,680
<i>Marian will be strategic.
But Sean...</i>

89
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,204
If he thinks it's
all over, he'll

90
00:08:05,228 --> 00:08:07,160
be more dangerous than ever.

91
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,840
You're a Wallace. A Wallace!

92
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,960
Everything hangs on our name.

93
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,080
Billy still isn't answering.

94
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,120
Nor is Jacqueline.

95
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,440
What?

96
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
It's us living like gypsies now.

97
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,320
Holed up in one of our own
fucking developments.

98
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,800
Should have been me
blowing his brains out.

99
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,520
You know, I can't
even say his name.

100
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,920
I set light to someone.

101
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,960
Threw them off
a fucking building.

102
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
For him.

103
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,040
They'll hit back.

104
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,080
At who?

105
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,120
The Dumanis?

106
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,160
That's not who we're up against.

107
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,720
Fighting people we'll
never find, never see.

108
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,760
Can't even put a name to them.

109
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
Then we go after
those we can see.

110
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,840
And that is the Dumanis.

111
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,880
They know who these people are.

112
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,760
<i>We stick to our plan.
We go back to Ireland -</i>

113
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,434
And then what? Come back here

114
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,280
with another one of your armies?

115
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,600
<i>To do what? Take down
the City of London?</i>

116
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,800
If that's what it takes, yes.

117
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
We found Sean Wallace's sister.

118
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,640
Satellite image
shows a farmhouse.

119
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,800
<i>That's the location.
Go get her now.</i>

120
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,600
And Leif, keep her alive.

121
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,640
Use her as bait.

122
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,680
Just get this done.

123
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,720
We need the Wallaces gone.

124
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,320
Quiet. And keep it simple.

125
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,360
Yes, sir.

126
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,280
Jacqui.

127
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,440
I've come to get you.

128
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,480
You need to leave here.

129
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,520
No.

130
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,560
I'm not going without you.

131
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,640
She sent you?

132
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,680
I just want you to be safe.

133
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,280
Look at us, Billy.

134
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,320
Is this safe?

135
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
Billy.

136
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,840
She's left a hundred messages.

137
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,280
There's no way I'm going back
to Ireland with her.

138
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,960
I've the best care in
the world lined up here.

139
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,200
This is where I'm going
to give birth to my child.

140
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,840
Jacqui, if I can find you,

141
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,440
the people who are hunting us
will be able to find you too.

142
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
Why would they?

143
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,520
I'm not a Wallace. Yes, you are.

144
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
They'll use you.

145
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,600
Our mother is using this,

146
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,680
like she always does,
to drag me back.

147
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
She's always dealt in fear.

148
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,080
It's her only commodity.

149
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,520
Billy, I'm not one of you.

150
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,480
I'm sorry.

151
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,640
Thanks for trusting me, Jacqui.

152
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's just to be safe.

153
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,160
What the fuck?

154
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,360
This place was
supposed to be empty.

155
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
Be careful. Stay here.

156
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,800
You're a Wallace.

157
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,320
A Wallace!

158
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,920
Everything hangs upon our name.

159
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,160
You can build an empire.

160
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,200
Be a king.

161
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,240
Do you want that, son?

162
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,560
Yeah.

163
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,560
Don't fucking yeah me!

164
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,240
Why?

165
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
Why? Why?

166
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Why?

167
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,240
Why? Why? Why?

168
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,280
Why?

169
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,320
Why?

170
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,040
Why? Why?

171
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,080
Why?

172
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,120
Be a king.

173
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,800
Good night, Dad.

174
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,040
Vicky's not coming.

175
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
Is she OK?

176
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,640
No, she's in deep shit.

177
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,680
But not as deep as you.

178
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,720
You set up a good cop.

179
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,884
I don't know what
you're talking about.

180
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:03,800
<i>What cop? Don't
you fucking dare.</i>

181
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,517
This thing you and Vicky set up

182
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,240
to pull out Anthony went wrong.

183
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,360
They sniffed Anthony out
before Vicky could get to him.

184
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,520
<i>Don't do it! Let it go!
Hold your fire!</i>

185
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,760
Drop your weapon!

186
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,880
Colin! Get in the fucking van!

187
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,920
Come on!

188
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,324
The only reason I'm
not arresting you right

189
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,680
now is that the Wallaces
have him hostage.

190
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,120
<i>Last chance, let him go! Don't
fucking think about it, bitch!</i>

191
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,160
Go! Go!

192
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,200
Anthony!

193
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,640
He's a good, decent man.

194
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,680
One of mine.

195
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,570
And he wasn't fucking one of the

196
00:20:42,594 --> 00:20:44,920
criminals he'd been
sent to investigate.

197
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,840
I'll find him. And call it in.

198
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,880
As soon as.

199
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,362
This family is
falling apart. And I'm

200
00:20:57,386 --> 00:20:59,600
the only one with
access to both sides.

201
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,080
The rift between the Wallaces
and Dumanis.

202
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,084
Finn wasn't the
hero Sean thought he

203
00:21:05,108 --> 00:21:07,040
was and it's fucking
with his head.

204
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,785
And when this facade crumbles,

205
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,760
because that's
exactly what it is,

206
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,371
I'll be there to see the real

207
00:21:12,395 --> 00:21:14,200
power behind
them. No, you won't.

208
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,920
And you never will,
you self-important prick.

209
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,040
You think the rest of us don't
know how the world works.

210
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,324
You're going to
do one thing, and

211
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:24,480
that's help me save a good man.

212
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,640
Then maybe, on a rare day,

213
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,120
you might just be able
to live with yourself.

214
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Fuck!

215
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,568
<i>Sean, you're all right.
He's been following</i>

216
00:21:52,592 --> 00:21:54,320
<i>me and Shannon.
It's being dealt with.</i>

217
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,518
Let me deal with it. You gave

218
00:21:55,542 --> 00:21:56,880
<i>him to me. It's
not our priority.</i>

219
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,517
If Anthony is a
police officer, we need

220
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,200
to find out - They'll
get it out of him.

221
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,320
<i>They're good at that.
Is he coming with us?</i>

222
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,360
Yes. Let's go. Sean!

223
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
Sean, let me do this!

224
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,166
The last thing you need is more

225
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,720
death. Especially a copper!

226
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,880
Elliot, we need to get what's
left of my family to safety.

227
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,945
Mum, you go on
ahead. I'll be waiting

228
00:22:14,969 --> 00:22:16,800
at the helicopter
for all of you.

229
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,840
Don't be long.

230
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,120
Keep trying Billy. And Jacqui.

231
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,840
Sean, you're going to get
through this. I know you are.

232
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,706
And when you do,
do you want all of

233
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,680
this taken away from
you by some cop?

234
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,232
Your mum's men, they're not

235
00:22:34,256 --> 00:22:36,120
going to ask the
right questions.

236
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,160
I will. Anthony knows me.

237
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
All right.

238
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,960
Colin's got him at one of our
construction sites.

239
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,240
All right. Get back here fast.

240
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,280
There's something I need to do.

241
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,280
You what? Wait a minute.

242
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Jonathan Seaton Cox?

243
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,400
<i>How long?
A little over five years ago.</i>

244
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:13,280
I've got a house, a car,
rock solid ID.

245
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,200
Smackheads, we spend
a lot of time... thinking.

246
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
Planning.

247
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,920
Of course, nothing
ever happens, but...

248
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
I got you the same.

249
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,520
You planned for me?

250
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,560
Five years ago?

251
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,600
A new life.

252
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,640
Not being a Wallace.

253
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,360
If you want it. I want it.

254
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,440
My daughter wants it
even more than I do.

255
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,760
Am I a... Seaton Cox as well?

256
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,800
Well, yeah.

257
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,840
You're my sister.

258
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,440
What's my first name?

259
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,600
Well, I was angry with you
at the time.

260
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,920
Actually, we've got a fuck of
a drive ahead of us. Jonathan?

261
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,760
What's my first name?

262
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,240
Arabella.

263
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,960
Arabella! Arabella Seaton Cox.

264
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,400
Look, they'll never find us.

265
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,560
Good.

266
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,040
Tariq?

267
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,560
<i>All four of them.
In Mosi's room.</i>

268
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,600
Number 47.

269
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,800
Around the corner. Number 47.

270
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,840
Tariq? Waiting for us.

271
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,560
Mosi, I delivered! I walk!

272
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,720
You said I walk!

273
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,960
You said... I walk!

274
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Mosi! Don't kill me!

275
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,080
Mosi! Don't kill me!

276
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,160
It's locked.

277
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,040
Open.

278
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,080
I said open.

279
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,840
Bukoroshe, such a pretty thing.

280
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,600
Ah. The traffic is too much.

281
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,360
Your wife says she'll be
with you in ten minutes.

282
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,040
It's a shame the children
are not with her.

283
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,120
Aghh!

284
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,160
Yaah!

285
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,200
Aagghh!

286
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,520
Aaaghh!

287
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,800
Are you OK?!

288
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,040
Everything will be OK.

289
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,800
I love you.

290
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,280
OK?

291
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,400
Can I come in?

292
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,440
Yeah.

293
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
They found some of the money.

294
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,040
250 million.

295
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,080
It was in the Caymans.

296
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,120
Finn really knew
what he was doing.

297
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,160
Can you get it
back? I already have.

298
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Always the smartest
one in the room.

299
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,798
There's still over
a billion left to

300
00:32:00,822 --> 00:32:03,160
<i>find. And that's only
what we know about.</i>

301
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,372
That should be enough
to keep Jevan and

302
00:32:05,396 --> 00:32:07,480
the investors off
our backs, for now.

303
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,720
No Sean?

304
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,280
And no sign of Marian
or Billy either.

305
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,480
Letting them live
would be a mistake.

306
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,240
That woman Finn
was running off with.

307
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,280
Floriana? Mm.

308
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,760
What if he did set her up
with an account?

309
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,812
Is there any way of getting her

310
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,480
full name or more background?

311
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,640
Well, she died the same night
as Finn.

312
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,800
You certain? Jevan told me.

313
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,035
I was thinking
someone might have

314
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:56,080
been smart enough
to keep her alive.

315
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,120
As a way of getting
to the money.

316
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,840
I'm coming. I'm coming!

317
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,560
She's so beautiful!

318
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,720
Do you want to hold her?

319
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,920
Oh, come, my little one.

320
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,280
Little one, you're beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful.

321
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,960
Oh, my little one.

322
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,200
Do you want to help me wash her?

323
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,280
Sshh!

324
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,800
You don't have to worry now.

325
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,680
As soon as my son returns,

326
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,720
and we have the money,

327
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,640
I promise you I will take care
of your baby.

328
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,680
Like it was my own.

329
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,040
OK?

330
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,920
Thank you for doing this.

331
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,480
Your grocery list.

332
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,400
Sean, if you do this,
there will be no going back.

333
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,440
I'll have my men
get this to you.

334
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,760
Let me know when
everything's in place.

335
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,800
Then we go after Asif.

336
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,740
What have you promised them?

337
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,740
Promised?

338
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,780
What?

339
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,380
<i>To whom? The people
that you've sold me to.</i>

340
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,211
Your dark arts
friends. The ones who

341
00:36:59,235 --> 00:37:01,140
are making sure
I'm streets ahead.

342
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,855
Where is this nonsense coming

343
00:37:02,879 --> 00:37:04,860
<i>from? Because
you'll want payback.</i>

344
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,877
The very fact of my son being

345
00:37:07,901 --> 00:37:11,300
the mayor of
London is my reward.

346
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,340
Can't you see that?

347
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,900
I come from nothing. Dirt poor!

348
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,420
I know hunger.

349
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,580
And the stability that is
going to come from knowing

350
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:31,340
that there will be
no sudden shocks,

351
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,060
no nonsense legislation,

352
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:38,100
and that London will be
open for business to all.

353
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,140
As usual.

354
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,820
That...

355
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,980
is the reward for everyone
who has invested in you.

356
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,300
We can keep doing this all day!

357
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,340
Aagh!

358
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,220
Aaaghh!

359
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,100
Are you working alone?

360
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,140
Aaagh!

361
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:06,180
<i>One last time!
Are you working alone?</i>

362
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,660
Aaaghh!

363
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,420
Aaaghh!

364
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,460
Stop! Put the drill down!

365
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,380
<i>Put your hands on your head!
Get down on your knees!</i>

366
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,594
Fuck's sake, you
too?! Fucking London,

367
00:39:23,618 --> 00:39:25,420
it's got more filth than crime.

368
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,460
Put it down! Fuck you!

369
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,780
<i>Put it down!
One less pig to worry about.</i>

370
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,540
No! No, no, no!

371
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,700
<i>Stick with me!
Anthony, stay with me!</i>

372
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,940
Hey! Hey!

373
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,980
No, no, no.

374
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:50,020
Coke on! Fuck!

375
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,500
<i>Hey, Antony!
Anthony, Anthony, Anthony!</i>

376
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,540
Jesus fucking
Christ! No, no, no!

377
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,580
I didn't tell them anything.

378
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,780
I know. Thank you.

379
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,860
Thank you, man. Just...

380
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,744
Just stay with me
now. I've called

381
00:40:04,768 --> 00:40:06,420
it in. They know where we are.

382
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,460
Anthony. Anthony! Stay with me.

383
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,500
No! No!

384
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,340
Shit!

385
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,500
Sean, where are you,
for God's sake?!

386
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,660
<i>Let me know what's happening.
Please.</i>

387
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,020
Have you spoken to Billy
and Jacqueline?

388
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,060
This isn't fair on me!

389
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,900
Shit.

390
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:10,060
Come on, come on!

391
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,540
Hold on!

392
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,940
Hey.Hey.

393
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,980
Come in. Thank you.

394
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,020
So um...

395
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:44,140
So... this is where you live.

396
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,740
I can see why you always
come to my place.

397
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,780
Yeah. Um...

398
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,460
Er... Thanks for coming round.

399
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:08,980
Come away with me.

400
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,020
Tonight.

401
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,780
You have to. I want to.

402
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:16,820
Then do it, Elliot.

403
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,860
It's too dangerous.

404
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:24,140
<i>Oh, fuck off. I grew up
in this life too, you know.</i>

405
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:28,420
<i>Hey. This isn't just about
Sean and your dad, Shannon.</i>

406
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,460
What are you talking about?

407
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,660
<i>Yeah, he's a threat.
He shot your dad in the leg.</i>

408
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,700
And he might not
have stopped there.

409
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,740
I...

410
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,220
There is something
else out there.

411
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:47,900
<i>What do you mean? Some
other gangs? Which ones?</i>

412
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,940
I...

413
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:53,140
I... I don't know exactly.

414
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:56,180
But there are people that Finn
dealt with, higher up.

415
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,220
And I need to find
out who they are.

416
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,897
Cos if I don't, Sean, no Sean,

417
00:46:59,921 --> 00:47:01,740
you and Danny
will never be safe.

418
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,780
So what does that
mean? It means...

419
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,100
It means you've
got to go, Shannon.

420
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:10,140
I have to stay with Sean.

421
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:12,180
He's paranoid and
he's on a mission.

422
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,300
If I abandon him now,
I'm on his list.

423
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,620
And I can't defend you
or Danny from him.

424
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:18,660
<i>Or anyone else.
This is bullshit!</i>

425
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,780
<i>Listen, listen.
When you are safe...</i>

426
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,940
When you are safe,
I will come for you.

427
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,340
Until then...

428
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,420
we can't be together. Why?

429
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:32,820
Why, Elliot? Because...

430
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,860
Because?

431
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,780
Is it because of them?

432
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,460
They... They...

433
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,500
They were my world.

434
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,540
Now you are.

435
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:54,940
That can't happen again.

436
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:59,300
I should never have let it
get to this.

437
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,020
We didn't have a choice.

438
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:58,860
Yeah? Hi.

439
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,660
Sean?

440
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,700
Is that you?

441
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,740
Working late?

442
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:11,260
Er... Yeah.

443
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:14,180
<i>I'm recovering the money.
I've found two lots now.</i>

444
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:17,540
<i>Hm. If anyone could,
it was going to be you.</i>

445
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,580
Well done.

446
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,620
Keeping those investors pleased.

447
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:28,620
Sean, we can stop this.

448
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,180
You and me.

449
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,220
I know we can.

450
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,052
I've come round to understanding

451
00:49:36,076 --> 00:49:37,780
why my father did what he did.

452
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:39,820
Yeah?

453
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:42,940
They killed him before they
knew he'd rob them, right?

454
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,700
<i>Er... That came out
afterwards, yeah.</i>

455
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:49,860
They killed him because
he'd had enough.

456
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,900
Like an old horse.

457
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:55,660
And that's the job
you just stepped into.

458
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,860
Or grabbed, with both hands.

459
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,900
Sean, what...

460
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,940
You can't take them on.

461
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:04,980
I know that, Alex.

462
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:07,020
You can't fight the invisible.

463
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:09,060
No-one can.

464
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,900
Go over to the window.

465
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,940
The one my dad
used to look out of.

466
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,980
What do you see?

467
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:32,460
<i>Our city. The one we
said belonged to us.</i>

468
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,860
That's what I'm looking at too.

469
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:38,860
Except I'm on the
opposite side from you.

470
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:41,820
It's a different view.

471
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:44,540
A lot of those red dots
out there are still ours.

472
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:46,580
We were good at building.

473
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,620
Still are, Sean.

474
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,700
Good at taking them down too.

475
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,740
That's progress.

476
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,780
Confidence.

477
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:59,540
That's what everyone
always says is important.

478
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,700
Keep everyone confident.

479
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,740
Business stops without it.

480
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,780
Yeah. Right.

481
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:10,100
The people who killed my father,

482
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,180
who tried to kill me,

483
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:15,620
from where I'm standing now,

484
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:17,660
I can't see them.

485
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,620
But I can see what they own.

486
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,020
What was that?

1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,224
As-salaam 'alaykum, Sajid.

2
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:18,018
Wa'alaykum salaam.

3
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:19,145
Altaf bhai.

4
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:25,151
[in Hindi] You got out.
You should be thanking us.

5
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:26,235
What for?

6
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,654
Because we saved you from the police.

7
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:31,824
But why?

8
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,077
- What had I done that you...
- Faizan bhai sends his regards.

9
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,457
He has big plans for you.

10
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:43,335
He doesn't want you caught
for petty IED blasts.

11
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:45,296
That's why he asked me to get you out.

12
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:46,881
They had no evidence against me.

13
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,257
Why take a chance?

14
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:49,925
That's why we put Kareem as bait.

15
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:51,677
To get their eyes off of you.

16
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:52,762
Kareem?

17
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:54,555
Kareem Bhat?

18
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:58,642
We knew those software idiots would
spill the beans about the drop box.

19
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:01,854
So, we sent them on the wrong trail.

20
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,439
What happened to him?

21
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:04,774
He was martyred.

22
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:08,360
Whatever happened was tragic,
but there was no other way.

23
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:10,321
We led him to the drop box.

24
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:13,491
Whatever happened after that was on him.

25
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:16,494
What does Faizan bhai want from me?

26
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:18,370
Only he knows.

27
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:20,498
But he did say that

28
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,459
after this,
people will call 26/11 child's play.

29
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,047
Rest. And don't go back to the hostel.

30
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,924
Look for a new place to stay.

31
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,176
I'll meet you again. May God be with you.

32
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:35,763
May God be with you.

33
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,557
- [doctor in English] What's his FiO2?
- [nurse] Sir, it's 60.

34
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,350
- Make it to 30, please.
- Yes, sir.

35
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,519
- Call Dr. Patel immediately.
- Yes, sir.

36
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,604
And, you, inform the ATS, please.

37
00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:31,819
[theme music playing]

38
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,545
[Srikant] We had information that

39
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:53,841
a drop box was being used
for terrorist activities.

40
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:57,595
Kareem used that drop box.

41
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:01,724
You found out about this drop box

42
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:07,730
through the three IT employees
who you arrested. Is that right?

43
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:12,985
Yes, sir.
Each one had individually confirmed this.

44
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:17,990
Did you think
that this drop box could be used

45
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:21,619
by a person
not involved with terrorist activities?

46
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:25,456
Um...

47
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,291
It didn't occur to me then.

48
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:30,127
What do you think now?

49
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,088
Now, I think that

50
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:39,887
somebody deliberately made Kareem...

51
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,807
...use that drop box.

52
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,518
I think he was framed.

53
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:47,853
Framed?

54
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,607
Was there any evidence against Kareem

55
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,818
besides the fact that
he used that drop box?

56
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:58,447
[in English] This is
Standard Operating Procedure, sir.

57
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:03,827
[in Hindi] Often, we need to take action
based on little evidence.

58
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,622
The suspect was kept under surveillance.

59
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,832
What did you find?

60
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:13,212
Actually, we heard Kareem
talking to two of his associates.

61
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,631
- [bureaucrat 1] Iqbal and Nissar.
- Yes, sir.

62
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:18,842
They were planning to attack MP Deshpande.

63
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,011
It's written here that

64
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:27,059
you heard them discuss
van, guest list and floor plan.

65
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:30,688
Yes, sir. We thought they were

66
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,232
going to launch an attack.

67
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,525
[bureaucrat 1] The only difference is

68
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:38,153
you didn't know
it was this sort of an attack.

69
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:39,655
No, sir.

70
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,865
Mr. Sharma's report mentions that

71
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,826
Kareem had never been officially arrested.

72
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:47,454
But he was always under surveillance
because of his actions.

73
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,999
Throwing ink on a politician,

74
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:52,584
writing anti-government blogs.

75
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:54,378
[in English] Is that right, Mr. Srikant?

76
00:04:57,423 --> 00:05:00,426
[in Hindi] Yes, sir.
But our actions are never based on

77
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,595
a person's political views.

78
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,389
Mr. Sharma, what is your assessment?

79
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,642
Sir, my assessment is the same.

80
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,020
[in English] Srikant is very impulsive.

81
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,438
[in Hindi] He does get
carried away sometimes.

82
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,690
[in English] And sometimes,
he doesn't follow rules.

83
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,818
He makes decisions
without bothering about the process.

84
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:21,113
[in Hindi] In some cases,
his approach has benefited us.

85
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:26,035
Yet, we can't
keep overlooking his mistakes.

86
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,911
But in this case, sir,

87
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,706
the evidence against Kareem
and his associates

88
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,791
were sufficient enough to act on.

89
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,503
[inaudible]

90
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:44,011
So, what we gather is, Mr. Srikant,

91
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:48,265
is that you had a suspect
who had anti-government views.

92
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,851
He had used a terrorist drop box,

93
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:54,146
and had planned an attack
with his associates on a MP.

94
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,356
In such little time, it was impossible

95
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,818
for your team to figure out
what the attack was.

96
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,528
- Yes, sir.
- We believe that

97
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:06,325
you had a valid reason to target Kareem.

98
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:10,204
And as far as their shooting is concerned,

99
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,749
it looks like a Force One call
and not TASC's.

100
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,460
Force One commander Pasha and his team

101
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,129
got carried away and shot them.

102
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:25,844
Mr. Srikant, the decision to shoot
was Force One's.

103
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:27,137
Is that right?

104
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:40,025
[in English] This was my operation.

105
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:45,322
[in Hindi] Every decision taken was mine.

106
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:50,869
Whatever happened,

107
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,791
if someone should be held accountable,

108
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:01,672
then I should be held responsible.

109
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:31,785
[winces]

110
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:39,209
[in Hindi] It'll hurt a bit.
You'll get better soon.

111
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:46,300
That friend of yours
regained consciousness today.

112
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,886
How is he?

113
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:54,224
He had regained consciousness,
but fell unconscious again.

114
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:57,019
The doctor says he'll be all right soon.

115
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,815
Praise be to God. I had lost all hope.

116
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,068
This wound has healed.

117
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,237
It won't hurt much now.

118
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,073
The doctor is saying
you'll be discharged soon.

119
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,229
Let me...

120
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,876
[door opens]

121
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:12,678
[door closes]

122
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,963
- As-salaam 'alaykum.
 -Wa'alaykum salaam.

123
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:48,922
Come in.

124
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:51,341
Have you heard of Basharat Ali?

125
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,635
Kashmir.

126
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:55,304
He's waiting for you in Srinagar.

127
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:00,684
What happened?

128
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,730
I haven't been to Srinagar since long.

129
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,735
The city reminds me of my brother.

130
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,904
He was 14

131
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:15,866
when these bastards shot him.

132
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,493
He was returning from school.

133
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,162
He saw a procession.

134
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,830
People were raising slogans.

135
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,207
He joined them.

136
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,919
It was a peaceful procession
from Lal Chowk to Jama Masjid.

137
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:30,672
No stone-pelting, no furore, nothing.

138
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,593
We have faced many atrocities.

139
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,470
But we'll avenge them all.

140
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:40,223
God has chosen you for this mission.

141
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,993
- What's all this?
- This is a ticket to Srinagar.

142
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:02,371
You'll need to leave soon.

143
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,917
Who else is involved in this mission...

144
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,418
Mission Zulfiqar.

145
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:10,379
Nobody knows anything.

146
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,217
Don't be offended, Altaf bhai,

147
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,511
but I know nothing about this mission.

148
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,763
And I work in my own way.

149
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,682
Which is why, before I do anything,
I want to speak to Faizan bhai once.

150
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,602
Each of us has been given a task.

151
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,479
We get orders from the top

152
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:30,732
and do what has been asked of us.

153
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,401
I was told to meet you.

154
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,945
I did that. That's all they asked of me.

155
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,116
Basharat's phone number
is fed into this phone.

156
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,076
Speak to him.

157
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:46,373
If Sharma finds out we're in the hospital,
he'll suspend us.

158
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,375
The investigation has still not ended.

159
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,503
We can keep doing our job till then.

160
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,965
As soon as Asif regains consciousness,
we'll start grilling him.

161
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,592
Nobody knows what is Mission Zulfiqar?

162
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:00,095
Only he knows what Mission Zulfiqar is.

163
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:04,057
[JK] Hey, Tiwari, we're not in a position

00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,353
[Srikant] Hello, Doctor.

166
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,814
- Hi.
- What's the update?

167
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:13,775
He had regained consciousness
some time back. I think he's stable now.

168
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:16,987
But it will take time for him to talk.

169
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,448
Is there any more danger?

170
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,324
No, no. He'll live.

171
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,784
And one more thing,

172
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:26,037
- the one who was shot in the arm...
- [nurse] Moosa.

173
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:29,291
- His name is Moosa Rahman.
- Yes, that one.

174
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:34,045
He's fine now. He's in a bit of pain,
but we can discharge him very soon.

175
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,550
Okay. Thanks.

176
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,596
You wait here. I'll be back. Hmm?

177
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:47,309
[Srikant] Rest as much as you want to.

178

The doctor said you'll be fine soon.

179
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,898
Once you are discharged,

180
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:57,527
you won't be sleeping royally like this.

181
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,988
Tell me something useful soon,

182
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:03,241
or get ready for some intensive care
by the police.

183

I need the laptop. Will you take time?

00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,560
Yes. Write in your notebook.

Come on, Mom. This is so annoying.

Fixing the house.

Oh, God.
Has everybody gone mad in this house?

No, it's all right, sir.

They were already saying that
the three deaths were Force One's fault.

They were looking to clear you.

[in Hindi] Sir,
you gave me responsibility,

- so, the consequences...
- I know that.

And, yes, there are consequences.

Thank you for your support.

Come on, uncle. I parked already.

- You don't seem to get it.

that we didn't just kill them,

Please don't do anything hasty.

326
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,722
You mean suicide?

327
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:36,017
I'm a Force One commando.

328
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:39,020
- Don't worry about me.
- That's not what I'm saying.

329
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:40,730
Did I say that?

330
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,648
This is getting too depressing!

331
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:56,454
What are you doing?

332
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:58,372
Haven't you slept?

333
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,249
No...

334
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:01,250
Even this one's come.

335
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:02,919
You don't want to go to school tomorrow?

336
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:04,629
Why aren't you sleeping?

337
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:05,838
Don't you have to go to college tomorrow?

338
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,383
Tomorrow...

339
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,928
No, I quit my job at the college.

340
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,721
I got a new job.

341
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,306
What? When?

342
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:17,516
- What? When?
- You didn't even tell us!

343
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,018
You didn't even tell us!

344
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:20,561
I'm telling you now!

345
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:22,563
- Only after I asked you.
- Only after I asked you.

346
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:23,940
[in English] You treat me like a child!

347
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:26,984
Suchi, you should have told me at least.

348
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:28,986
[Dhriti speaking Hindi]
But why? What is this new job about?

349
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:31,280
Relax, dear! I'll tell you
everything tomorrow.

350
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:32,531
Now go to sleep!

351
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:34,492
[in English] Okay, Suchi.
Let's have a chat tomorrow.

352
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:36,244
[in Tamil] Run along now!

353
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,079
[in Hindi] I'm going
to come back in five minutes.

354
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:39,413
[in Tamil] You'll get a beating
if you don't sleep.

355
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:40,790
[Atharv speaking English]
I love you too, Suchi.

356
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:02,228
[in Hindi] Moosa?

357
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:04,730
What happened?

358
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:06,190
Are you in pain?

359
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:09,277
I'll tell the doctor
to give you more painkillers...

360
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:12,238
What happened to you?

361
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:14,115
I don't want to get better.

362
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:16,909
Then, do you want stay
in a hospital like this?

363
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:20,288
If I recover,

364
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:22,873
they'll pick me up
and throw me in some corner.

365
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:26,919
They'll kill me, Mary.

366
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:28,462
Don't be like that.

367
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,214
God is with you.

368
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:32,508
[in English] I don't know about God.

369
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:37,805
[in Malayalam] Thank God you are with me.

370
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:43,227
[in Malayalam] I'm telling you,
everything will be fine.

371
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:46,564
Have faith in God.

372
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:48,209
[in Hindi] Tomorrow is my mom's birthday.

373
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:51,003
Both our birthdays are on the same day.

374
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,053
[in Malayalam] We used to
celebrate every year.

375
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:00,763
Mom would cook for us.

376
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:04,683
Chicken rice, beef...

377
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:07,686
Prawn curry is my favorite.

378
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:13,651
Dad used to visit the north,

379
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,529
and had learnt how to cook paratha.

380
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,032
All of us used to sit in a circle

381
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:22,701
on the floor and eat.

382
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:29,458
Dad would tell us stories
about places he had visited.

383
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:31,252
Rajasthan...

384
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:33,087
Punjab...

385
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:35,756
Gujarat.

386
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:45,433
All of them must be
thinking about you, right?

387
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:47,935
[in Hindi] Your sister must be

388
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:49,687
in college now, right?

389
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:51,439
[in Hindi] She's dead.

390
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:54,733
They killed her.

391
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,903
Dad too.

392
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,657
Only Mom is alive.

393
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:04,160
She must be sitting all alone at home.

394
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,081
And I can't even wish her

395
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,041
on her birthday.

396
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,678
[stammering]

397
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,805
It's your birthday in fifteen minutes!

398
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:33,147
Listen.

399
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:37,026
Don't utter a word about this to anybody.

400
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,737
Or I'll be in deep trouble.

401
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,072
Take this.

402
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:43,449
Happy birthday!

403
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,327
Call your mom,

404
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,329
and wish her.

405
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:49,830
Quick!

406
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:51,749
And listen...

407
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,003
[in Malayalam] Talk softly.

408
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:15,356
[in Hindi] Mom!

409
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:17,024
Mom, it's me!

410
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,860
Happy birthday, Mom. Happy birthday!

411
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,531
Thank you, thank you.

412
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,325
[speaking indistinctly]

413
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:29,370
Allah Hafiz, Mom.

414
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:14,081
Will you be back before my holidays begin?

415
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,874
Definitely.

416
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,751
Don't lie to me, Dad.

417
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:19,795
I'm telling you I'll be back by then.

418
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:22,548
JK, tell me the truth please?

419
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:24,633
He's telling you the truth.

420
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:27,636
He's going for a training workshop
to Srinagar.

421
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,305
[in English] You don't
have to worry about anything.

422
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,391
[Atharv] Papa, please don't go!

423
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:34,226
I'll call you every day.

424
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:35,436
Okay?

425
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:38,147
[whispering] Don't trouble Mom too much.

426
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:39,732
Okay?

427
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:40,899
Promise?

428
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:43,068
[Dhriti] You two are fighting, aren't you?

429
00:31:43,444 --> 00:31:45,029
It's obvious. I'm not a kid.

430
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:46,322
Really?

431
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:49,992
You've grown up a lot. Hmm?

432
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,036
Our Sri is going to Srinagar! [laughing]

433
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:53,954
Sri, Srinagar? No?

434
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:58,751
Will you lie to me, too?

435
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:04,840
Nobody can lie to you and your husband!

436
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,509
Actually,

437
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:09,678
there's an inquiry going on against him.

438
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:13,223
So, this is a punishment of sorts.

439
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:15,934
But don't worry.

440
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:19,188
He's our big boss Kulkarni's favorite.

441
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:21,649
He won't let him stay there for long.

442
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:23,776
I hope he's not going
on a mission or something?

443
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,152
Oh, God.

444
00:32:25,486 --> 00:32:27,237
There's no mission, Suchi!

445
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:29,615
Don't worry! Everything's fine.

446
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:31,867
How much longer, Sri?

447
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,494
Don't be glued to your phone
all the time.

448
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:36,413
- Take care of him.
- Help him with his homework.

449
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,832
Put him to sleep on time.
I know all that, okay!

450
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:41,710
- Now will you answer my question, please?
- What?

451
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:44,588
Is everything fine between Mom and you?
You two cool?

452
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,340
- What do you mean?
- Shut up!

453
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,175
You get a glass of water.

454
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:49,593
Go!

455
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:53,013
You just focus on playing
your flute and harmonica.

456
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,307
Got it? You need to master them.

457
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:57,309
We're spending a lot of money on that.

458
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:59,770
Papa, Papa! Remember
how you thrashed that man!

459
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:01,647
Didn't I tell you to zip it?

460
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,732
Yes. But even I want
to learn how to fight!

461
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:06,068
Why do you want to learn to fight?

462
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:09,738
You still haven't learned to touch
your elders' feet for blessings!

463
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:12,533
When was the last time
you touched my feet?

464
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:14,326
- Come on, touch my feet!
- Paa.

465
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,577
Touch my feet.

466
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:17,663
Bless you, may you always be happy.

467
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:20,040
Suchi, please!

468
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:27,965
Bye! Bye!

469
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:31,844
You're not doing this
to get back at me, are you?

470
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,430
No. I am just

471
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,265
following the department's orders.

472
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:38,308
I know you won't have much time,

473
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:41,437
but call me at least once a day
and tell me you're okay.

474
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,521
Okay, bye!

475
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:58,454
I'd have taken a taxi.
Why did you have to come?

476
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:00,914
Don't dick around with me.

477
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:04,293
The cold war's between Suchi and you,
not between us.

478
00:34:04,418 --> 00:34:06,462
- Move it!
- Move it!

479
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:14,762
- Mom!
- Hmm?

480
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:19,141
Is everything fine between you and Dad?

481
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,310
Yes. Why?

482
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:23,270
[in English] I just felt...

483
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:25,606
- What?
- I don't know.

484
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:26,982
I am sad.

485
00:34:29,777 --> 00:34:30,903
What is it, darling?

486
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:37,117
Don't worry. Dad will be back soon.

487
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:38,202
Okay?

488
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:39,745
I hope so.

489
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:41,580
Mom!

490
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,500
[in Hindi] Mom,
I don't feel like going to school.

491
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:46,418
So, don't go.

492
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:48,378
When you grow up, you can become a maid.

493
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:52,299
I'll tell our maid to train you.

494
00:34:52,508 --> 00:34:54,760
I'll also give you an internship at home.

495
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:55,886
Ha-ha-ha!

496
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:56,970
Very funny!

497
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:01,183
I screwed up again.

498
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,267
What?

499
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:03,685
You mean, once again?

500
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:07,481
- Sorry, I meant...
- No.

501
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,734
I held a grudge
for a bit too long this time.

502
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:12,069
Listen, man,

503
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:14,488
don't worry about Suchi.

504
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:16,156
She'll calm down.

505
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,158
I know you two for fifteen years.

506
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:19,409
Nothing will change.

507
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,119
One more thing.

508
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,997
Don't stroll around all alone
in Srinagar.

509
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,959
Always carry your gun.

510
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:29,628
When in doubt,

511
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,046
shoot first.

512
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,090
Who's your CO there?

513
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:34,424
Guess.

514
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:36,718
Come on, tell me.

515
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,307
Saloni.

516
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:44,893
Oh, fuck! [laughing]

517
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:46,937
- You think it's funny?
- Shit!

518
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:50,691
Why do such things happen only to you?

519
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:55,821
This is fucking ridiculous! Saloni!

520
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,990
And that too in the middle of this mess!

521
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:05,914
[Sameer speaking over phone]
As-salaam 'alaykum, General.

522
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:06,915
[in Hindi] There's some good news.

523
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:07,958
[Ansari] Wa'alaykum salaam.

524
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,376
[Samir] Our mujahid will be

525
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,128
discharged from the hospital
 in two or three days.

526
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:13,839
I've asked the sleeper cell
 to be on standby for the operation.

527
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:14,965
Good.

528
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,759
We need to get Zulfiqar
back on track again

529
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:19,303
as soon as possible,

530
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:23,056
without any waste of time.

531
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,142
Is our second fighter in place?

532
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:26,310
Yes, sir.

533
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:27,978
He's got his orders

534
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,396
and has left for Kashmir.

535
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:30,898
Remember,

536
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:33,609
this time, there should be no mistakes.

537
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:35,193
Sir!

538
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,238
Kudha Hafiz.

539
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:54,296
Hello, sir!

540
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,298
Sorry, I just saw your message.

541
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:58,383
- Have you reached?
 -Just landed, sir.

542
00:36:58,467 --> 00:37:00,677
I've sent you to Srinagar for a reason.

543
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:02,346
I'm not that stupid, sir.

544
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:04,681
I've been working with you for years now.

545
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:06,725
I was only awaiting orders.

546
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:08,810
We've got information from RAW

547
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:13,357
that a key asset of Mission Zulfiqar
has reached Kashmir.

548
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,985
[in English] I want you
 to dig deeper into this.

549
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,696
[in Hindi] Be careful, it's Kashmir,

550
00:37:20,781 --> 00:37:22,908
it doesn't take long for things
to blow out of proportion.

551
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,952
Thank you, sir. I'll keep that in mind.

552
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:28,080
Okay, sir. They have come to receive me.

553
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:30,082
[in English] Okay. Take care.

554
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:31,667
Thank you, sir.

555
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,524
[in Hindi] How are things
over here nowadays?

556
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,985
[driver] Can't you see?

557
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,612
It feels like a free bird has been caged.

558
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:47,325
These fuckers call Kashmir
the crown of India.

559
00:38:50,704 --> 00:38:53,457
But they treat us like shit.

560
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:56,293
If they had as much concern
for the Kashmiri people

561
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,254
as they have for Kashmir,
things would be different.

562
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:00,881
That is the tragedy.

563
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:03,008
But everything is going to change now.

564
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:04,468
Inshallah.

565
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,845
[Srikant] How are things here nowadays?

566
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:10,057
[army driver]
We're calling the shots here.

567
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,893
Someone told me the number
of tourists here has shot up.

568
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:17,314
I can see the tourists...

569
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,399
In uniform.

570
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,280
[Sajid] When do I meet Basharat?

571
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,991
- I don't know.
- Then what do I do now?

572
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,912
Just lie low and wait.

573
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:34,039
They'll let you know later.

574
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:41,213
"If there is ever heaven on earth,

575
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:46,635
"it is here, it is here, it is here."

576
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:18,583
- What's wrong?
- I want to see my brother.

577
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:22,879
Asif?

578
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:28,677
But you don't have access to that room.

579
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:31,972
[in Malayalam] I need to see him, Mary.

580
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:33,306
I need to see my brother.

581
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,392
[in Hindi] How will you go there?

582
00:40:53,577 --> 00:40:55,245
What are you doing?

583
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:57,789
[in Malayalam] Mary...

584
00:40:58,081 --> 00:40:59,791
I have to see him.

585
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,418
Moosa...

586
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:09,467
[in Malayalam] I'll have a lot to answer.
I'll lose my job.

587
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,305
Mary...

588
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:15,891
I won't put you in trouble.

589
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:17,475
[in English] Trust me.

590
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:25,942
I'll be right back.

591
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:39,724
[beeping]

592
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:44,831
[in Malayalam] "Did you squeal
like a rat to the infidels?"

593
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,834
No, Asif bhai... I didn't.

594
00:43:58,345 --> 00:44:00,055
"What are you doing here?"

595
00:44:37,926 --> 00:44:40,053
Nothing personal, Asif bhai.

596
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,350
Potassium.

597
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,520
I injected it into your bloodstream.

598
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,649
Close your eyes.

599
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,403
You'll go in peace.

600
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:02,325
I don't want you
to squeal like a rat to the infidels

601
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:05,203
about Zulfiqar.

602
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:28,560
Allah Hafiz, brother.
